{"id":"220616932_Pseudorandom_Bits_for_Polynomials","abstract":"We present a new approach to constructing pseudorandom generators that fool low- degree polynomials over finite fields, based on the Gowers norm. sUsing this approach, we obtain the following main constructions of explicitly computable generators G : Fs → Fn that fool polynomials over a finite field F: 1. a generator that fools degree-2 (i.e., quadratic) polyno mials to within error 1/n, with seed length s = 0(log n), 2. a generator that fools degree-3 (i.e., cubic) polynomials to within error ∈, with seed length s = O(log|F| n) + f (∈,F), where f depends only on ∈ and F (not on n), 3. assuming the \"inverse conjecture for the Gowers norm,\" for every d a generator that fools degree-d polynomials to within error ∈, with seed length s = 0(d · log|F| n) + f (d,∈,F), where f depends only on d, ∈,and F (not on n). We stress that the results in (1) and (2) are unconditional, i.e., do not rely on any unproven assumption. Moreover, the results in (3) rely on a special case of the conjecture which may be easier to prove. Our generator for degree-d polynomials is the componentw ise sum of d generators for degree-1 polynomials (on independent seeds). Prior to our work, generators with logarithmic seed length were only known for degree-1 (i.e., linear) polynomials [J. Naor and M. Naor, SIAM J. Comput., 22 (1993), pp. 838-856]. In fact, over small fields such as F2 = {0, 1}, our results constitute the first progress on these problems since the long-standing generator by Luby, Veličković, and Wigderson [Deterministic approximate counting of depth-2 circuits, in Proceedings of the 2nd Israeli Symposium on Theoretical Computer Science (ISTCS), 1993, pp. 18-24], whose seed length is much bigger: s = exp (ω (√log n)), even for the case of degree-2 polynomials over 7Fdbl;2.","authors":["Andrej Bogdanov","Emanuele Viola"],"meta":["January 2010SIAM Journal on Computing 39(6):2464-2486","DOI:10.1137/070712109","SourceDBLP"],"references":["225134981_Testing_Low-Degree_Polynomials_over_GF2","221591859_Unconditional_pseudorandom_generators_for_low_degree_polynomials","38413447_Randomness-Efficient_Low-Degree_Tests_and_Short_PCPs_Via_Epsilon-Biased_Sets","3077956_Construction_of_asymptotically_good_low-rate_error-correcting_codes_through_pseudo-random_graphs","1899973_Inverse_Conjecture_for_the_Gowers_norm_is_false","277285522_Modern_cryptography_probabilistic_proofs_and_pseudorandomness_volume_17_of_Algorithms_and_Combinatorics","259852741_Modern_Cryptography_Probabilistic_Proofs_and_Pseudorandomness","246193402_Finite_Fields_Encyclopedia_of_Mathematics","238885359_An_inverse_theorem_for_the_Gowers_U3_G_norm","232633216_Simple_construction_of_almost_k-wise_independent_random_variables","228057650_Multiparty_Protocols_Pseudorandom_Generators_for_Logspace_and_Time-Space_Trade-offs","226332619_MOD_p-tests_Almost_Independence_and_Small_Probability_Spaces","226312055_A_New_Proof_of_Szemerdi's_Theorem_for_Arithmetic_Progressions_of_Length_Four","225320288_A_new_proof_of_Szemeredi's_theorem","225164213_Small_Sample_Spaces_Cannot_Fool_Low_Degree_Polynomials","221591876_Pseudorandom_generators_for_low_degree_polynomials","221580778_Norms_XOR_Lemmas_and_Lower_Bounds_for_GF2_Polynomials_and_Multiparty_Protocols","221499202_Simple_Constructions_of_Almost_k-Wise_Independent_Random_Variables","220617752_Pseudorandom_Bits_for_Constant-Depth_Circuits_with_Few_Arbitrary_Symmetric_Gates","220138042_New_correlation_bounds_for_GF2_polynomials_using_Gowers_uniformity","4351599_The_Sum_of_d_Small-Bias_Generators_Fools_Polynomials_of_Degree_d","4294386_Pseudorandom_Bits_for_Polynomials","3516091_Deterministic_approximate_counting_of_depth-2_circuits","3498813_New_algorithms_for_finding_irreducible_polynomials_over_finite_fields","2329655_Small-Bias_Probability_Spaces_Efficient_Constructions_and_Applications","2319374_Concentration_of_Measure_for_the_Analysis_of_Randomised_Algorithms","2254777_New_Algorithms_for_Finding_Irreducible_Polynomials_Over_Finite_Fields","2127335_Low-degree_tests_at_large_distances","2123000_Gowers_Uniformity_Influence_of_Variables_and_PCPs","2118144_An_inverse_theorem_for_the_Gowers_U3_norm","1763318_The_distribution_of_polynomials_over_finite_fields_with_applications_to_the_Gowers_norms"]}
