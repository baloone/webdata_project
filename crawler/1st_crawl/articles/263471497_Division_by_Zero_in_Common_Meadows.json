{"id":"263471497_Division_by_Zero_in_Common_Meadows","abstract":"Common meadows are fields expanded with a total inverse function. Division by\nzero produces an additional value denoted with \"a\" that propagates through all\noperations of the meadow signature (this additional value can be interpreted as\nan error element). We provide a basis theorem for so-called common cancellation\nmeadows of characteristic zero, that is, common meadows of characteristic zero\nthat admit a certain cancellation law.","authors":["Jan Bergstra","Alban Ponse"],"meta":["June 2014","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-15545-6_6","SourcearXiv"],"references":["266036168_Free_algebras_over_all_fields_and_pseudo-fields","250613822_Signed_Meadow_valued_Probability_Mass_Functions","237010083_Cancellation_Meadows_a_Generic_Basis_Theorem_and_Some_Applications","234800298_The_rational_numbers_as_an_abstract_data_type","312787250_Handbook_of_Theoretical_Computer_Science","268451688_Fracpairs_fractions_over_a_reduced_commutative_ring","262974724_Division_by_zero_in_non-involutive_meadows","258082303_Equations_for_formally_real_meadows","243113671_Equational_theories_and_universal_theories_of_fields","242355338_A_Generic_Basis_Theorem_for_Cancellation_Meadows"]}
