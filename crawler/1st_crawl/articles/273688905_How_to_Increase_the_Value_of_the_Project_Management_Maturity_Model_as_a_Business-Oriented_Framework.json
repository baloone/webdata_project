{"id":"273688905_How_to_Increase_the_Value_of_the_Project_Management_Maturity_Model_as_a_Business-Oriented_Framework","abstract":"An organizationâ€™s effectiveness partly depends on the success of its projects. With this in mind, many efforts have been spent in recent decades to enhance the project management culture, but results are still highly unsatisfactory. Project Management Maturity Models (PMMMs) are seen by both the academic and the industrial communities as a solid instrument to achieve this goal. The point at issue is that surveys and researches show PMMMs must be better linked to business and\nfinancial performance. The aim of this paper is to explore the scope for improvement to evolve PMMMs as business-oriented frameworks.","authors":["Maria Elena Nenni","Vincenzo Arnone","Paolo Boccardelli","Iolanda Napolitano"],"meta":["February 2014International Journal of Engineering Business Management 6(4):1","DOI:10.5772/58292"],"references":["268386513_Product_Lifecycle_Management_as_a_Tool_to_Create_Value_in_the_Fashion_System","258933502_Project_management_maturity_models_The_silver_bullets_of_competitive_advantage","237401295_The_maturity_of_project_management_in_different_industries","348844282_Stakeholder_Relationship_Management_A_Maturity_Model_for_Organisational_Implementation","284295949_Longitudinal_Analysis_of_Project_Management_Maturity","265669025_A_framework_for_the_comparison_of_Maturity_Models_for_Project-based_Management","249727240_Contingency_Theory_Applied_to_Religious_Organizations","248345202_A_two-way_influence_between_strategy_and_project_management","241046050_Research_on_Maturity_Model_of_Enterprise_NPD_Project_Management","235280160_Using_a_Reliability_Capability_Maturity_Model_to_Benchmark_Electronics_Companies"]}
