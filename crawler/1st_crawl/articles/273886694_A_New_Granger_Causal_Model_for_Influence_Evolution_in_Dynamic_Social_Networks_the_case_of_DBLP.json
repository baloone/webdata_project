A weighted temporal\nmultigraph is employed to represent the dynamics\nof the social networks and analyze the influence relationships\nbetween communities over time. To ensure the\ninterpretability of the knowledge discovered, evolution\nof the influence relationships is assessed by introducing\nthe Granger causality. Through extensive experiments,\nwe empirically demonstrate the suitability of our model\nfor studying the evolution of influence between communities.\nMoreover, we empirically show how our model is\nable to accurately predict the influence of communities\nover time using random forest regression.","authors":["Belkacem Chikhaoui","Mauricio Chiazzaro","Shengrui Wang"],"meta":["January 2015","Conference: AAAI 2015At: Austin, Texas, USA","Project: Social network analysis"],"references":["266069289_Modeling_Shared_Tastes_in_Online_Communities","265787347_Modeling_Indirect_Influence_on_Twitter","265088939_BIAS-CORRECTED_QUANTILE_REGRESSION_FORESTS_FOR_HIGH-DIMENSIONAL_DATA","261834826_Influence_Maximization_with_Viral_Product_Design","257896068_CSI_Community-Level_Social_Influence_Analysis","228861739_Machine_Learning_Benchmarks_and_Random_Forest_Regression","221613468_Mining_topic-level_influence_in_heterogeneous_networks","221520208_Learning_influence_probabilities_in_social_networks","220724790_Ranking_of_Closeness_Centrality_for_Large-Scale_Social_Networks","47863654_Unsupervised_Prediction_of_Citation_Influences","262236800_Modeling_direct_and_indirect_influence_across_heterogeneous_social_networks","262154866_Social_influence_locality_for_modeling_retweeting_behaviors","261427797_Measuring_Pair-Wise_Social_Influence_in_Microblog","257553516_Learning_influence_from_heterogeneous_social_networks","254464401_Exploring_social_influence_for_recommendation_-_A_generative_model_approach","230640455_Cross-Community_Influence_in_Discussion_Fora","225279405_Information_Diffusion_and_External_Influence_in_Networks","221653366_Social_influence_analysis_in_large-scale_networks","221653337_Efficient_influence_maximization_in_social_networks","45913059_Empirical_Comparison_of_Algorithms_for_Network_Community_Detection","4894383_Investigating_Causal_Relations_by_Econometric_Models_and_Cross-Spectral_Methods","4849720_Non-linear_Granger_causality_in_the_currency_futures_returns"]}
