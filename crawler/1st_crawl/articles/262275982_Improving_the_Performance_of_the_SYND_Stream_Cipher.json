{"id":"262275982_Improving_the_Performance_of_the_SYND_Stream_Cipher","abstract":"In 2007, Gaborit et al. proposed the stream cipher SYND as an improvement of the pseudo random number generator due to Fischer and Stern. This work shows how to improve considerably the efficiency the SYND cipher without using the so-called regular encoding and without compromising the security of the modified SYND stream cipher. Our proposal, called XSYND, uses a generic state transformation which is reducible to the Regular Syndrome Decoding problem (RSD), but has better computational characteristics than the regular encoding. A first implementation shows that XSYND runs much faster than SYND for a comparative security level (being more than three times faster for a security level of 128 bits, and more than 6 times faster for 400-bit security), though it is still only half as fast as AES in counter mode. Parallel computation may yet improve the speed of our proposal, and we leave it as future research to improve the efficiency of our implementation.","authors":["Mohammed Meziani","Gerhard Hoffmann","Pierre-Louis Cayrel"],"meta":["July 2012Lecture Notes in Computer Science 7374:99-116","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-31410-0_7","Conference: Proceedings of the 5th international conference on Cryptology in Africa"],"references":["266275195_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","228531209_Improving_the_efficiency_of_Generalized_Birthday_Attacks_against_certain_structured_cryptosystems","224319898_SYND_a_Fast_Code-Based_Stream_Cipher_with_a_Security_Reduction","242609050_Overview_of_IEEE_80211b_Security","235008694_How_to_generate_cryptographically_strong_sequences_of_pseudorandom_bits","228865233_Linearization_attacks_against_syndrome_based_hashes","228819914_BMGL_Synchronous_Key-stream_Generator_with_Provable_Security_Revision_1","227307467_A_Generalized_Birthday_Problem","224678926_Asymptotic_improvement_of_the_Gilbert-Varshamov_bound_for_binary_linear_codes","223419521_QUAD_A_multivariate_stream_cipher_with_provable_security"]}
