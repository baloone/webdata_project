{"id":"311586220_A_General_Approach_for_Predicting_the_Behavior_of_the_Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States","abstract":"Building on developments in machine learning and prior work in the science of judicial prediction, we construct a model designed to predict the behavior of the Supreme Court of the United States in a generalized, out-of-sample context. Our model leverages the random forest method together with unique feature engineering to predict nearly two centuries of historical decisions (1816-2015). Using only data available prior to decision, our model outperforms null (baseline) models at both the justice and case level under both parametric and non-parametric tests. Over nearly two centuries, we achieve 70.2\\% accuracy at the case outcome level and 71.9\\% at the justice vote level. More recently, over the past century, we outperform an \\textit{in-sample optimized} null model by nearly 5 \\%. Our performance is consistent with, and improves on the general level of prediction demonstrated by prior work; however, our model is distinctive because it can be applied out-of-sample to the entire past and future of the Court, not a single term. Our results represent an advance for the science of quantitative legal prediction and portend a range of other potential applications.","authors":["Daniel Martin Katz","II Michael J Bommarito","Josh Blackman"],"meta":["December 2016PLoS ONE 12(4)","DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0174698"],"references":["310615519_Predicting_Judicial_Decisions_of_the_European_Court_of_Human_Rights_A_Natural_Language_Processing_Perspective","309399037_Predicting_judicial_decisions_of_the_European_Court_of_Human_Rights_a_Natural_Language_Processing_perspective","327606791_Classification_And_Regression_Trees","318672026_Correction_to_Separation-of-Powers_Games_in_the_Positive_Theory_of_Congress_and_Courts","310606656_Classification_and_regression_trees","298017080_Ideological_drift_among_supreme_court_justices_Who_when_and_how_important","289753905_Machine_learning_and_law","288906520_Random_forests","281262003_Law_on_the_Market_Evaluating_the_Securities_Market_Impact_of_Supreme_Court_Decisions","267457128_Choice_of_Law_An_Empirical_Analysis"]}
