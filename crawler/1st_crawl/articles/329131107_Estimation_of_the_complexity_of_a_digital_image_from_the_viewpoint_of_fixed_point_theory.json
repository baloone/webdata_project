To do this work, we need to study some properties of iterations of a k −DC-self-map f of ( X , k ) and to establish the notion of complexity of ( X , k ) denote by C � ( X , k ) (see Definition 7 in the present paper). According to C � ( X , k ), we can estimate com- plexity of the fixed point property of ( X , k ) for any k −DC-self-map f of ( X , k ). Based on this approach, the present paper investigates some relationships between the k -adjacency of ( X , k ) and C � ( X , k ). Furthermore, we prove that C � ( X , k ) is not a digital topological invari- ant. Besides, we develop the notions of uniform k -connectedness and strict k -connectivity to calculate C � ( X , k ) for some digital images ( X , k ). In the paper each ( X , k ) is assumed to be a k -connected and non-empty set and 2 ≤| X | �∞ , where | X | means the cardinal number of the given set X .","authors":["Sang-Eon Han"],"meta":["November 2018Applied Mathematics and Computation 347:236-248","DOI:10.1016/j.amc.2018.10.067"],"references":[]}
