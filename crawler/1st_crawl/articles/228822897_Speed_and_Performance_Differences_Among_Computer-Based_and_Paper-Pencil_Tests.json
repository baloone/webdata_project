{"id":"228822897_Speed_and_Performance_Differences_Among_Computer-Based_and_Paper-Pencil_Tests","abstract":"This study investigated the effect of several different modes of test adminis-tration on scores and completion times. In Experiment 1, paper-based assess-ment was compared to computer-based assessment. Undergraduates com-pleted the computer-based assessment faster than the paper-based assessment, with no difference in scores. Experiment 2 assessed three different computer interfaces that provided students various levels of flexibility to change and review answers. No difference in scores was observed among the three modes, but students completed the least-flexible mode faster than the other two modes. It appears that less flexible test modes are faster and do not result in poorer performance than more flexible modes.","authors":["SHAWN M. BODMANN","Daniel H.
