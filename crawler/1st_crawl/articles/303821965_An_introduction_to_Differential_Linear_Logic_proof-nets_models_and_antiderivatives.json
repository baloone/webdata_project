{"id":"303821965_An_introduction_to_Differential_Linear_Logic_proof-nets_models_and_antiderivatives","abstract":"Differential Linear Logic enriches Linear Logic with additional logical rules for the exponential connectives, dual to the usual rules of dereliction, weakening and contraction. We present a proof-net syntax for Differential Linear Logic and a categorical axiomatization of its denotational models. We also introduce a simple categorical condition on these models under which a general antiderivative operation becomes available. Last we briefly describe the model of sets and relations and give a more detailed account of the model of finiteness spaces and linear and continuous functions.","authors":["Thomas Ehrhard"],"meta":["June 2016Mathematical Structures in Computer Science 28(7)","DOI:10.1017/S0960129516000372"],"references":["257642501_Reversible_Irreversible_and_Optimal_l-machines","251825578_Linearity_and_nonlinearity_in_distributed_computation","238675890_Categorical_Semantics_of_Linear_Logic","232004409_Differential_categories","223417160_A_Calculus_for_Interaction_Nets_Based_on_the_Linear_Chemical_Abstract_Machine","221558173_Full_Abstraction_for_Resource_Calculus_with_Tests","220909773_Linear_Domains_and_Linear_Maps","2432941_What_is_a_Categorical_Model_of_Intuitionistic_Linear_Logic","311687883_Transport_of_finiteness_structures_and_applications","284068292_The_conservation_theorem_for_differential_nets","280853090_Algebraic_totality_towards_completeness","266752743_Interactive_models_of_computation_and_program_behavior","266659011_A_new_correctness_criterion_for_MLL_proof_nets","266436752_Categories_for_the_working_mathematician_4th_corrected_printing","265354140_Categories_for_the_working_mathematician_2nd_ed","256555068_The_system_F_of_variable_types_fifteen_years_later","254799676_Generalizing_Automath_by_Means_of_a_Lambda-Typed_Lambda_Calculus","242807392_Normal_functors_power_series_and_l-calculus","242154846_Dieren_tial_Structure_in_Models_of_Multiplicative_Biadditive_Intuitionistic_Linear_Logic_Extended_Abstract","226345050_What_is_a_categorical_model_of_Intuitionistic_Linear_Logic","225130884_The_Cut-Elimination_Theorem_for_Differential_Nets_with_Promotion","223122873_The_differential_lambda-calculus","222840072_Uniformity_and_the_Taylor_expansion_of_ordinary_lambda-terms","222745053_Reversible_Irreversible_and_Optimal_l-machines","222458666_Computational_interpretations_of_linear_logic","222423807_The_differential_-calculus","221942985_Linear_Logic","221652967_Bohm_Trees_Krivine's_Machine_and_the_Taylor_Expansion_of_Lambda-Terms","221323260_Parallel_Reduction_in_Resource_Lambda-Calculus","220727482_Differential_Structure_in_Models_of_Multiplicative_Biadditive_Intuitionistic_Linear_Logic","220727472_Realizability_Proof_for_Normalization_of_Full_Differential_Linear_Logic","220173772_Finiteness_spaces","220173316_A_semantics_for_lambda_calculi_with_resources","220148172_Handsome_proof-nets_Perfect_matchings_and_cographs","46417134_A_call-by-name_lambda-calculus_machine","45923995_A_Convenient_Differential_Category","45913175_Transport_of_finiteness_structures_and_applications","45896087_A_Finiteness_Structure_on_Resource_Terms","45889680_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","40838356_SEMANTIQUES_ET_SYNTAXES_VECTORIELLES_DE_LA_LOGIQUE_LINEAIRE","29609516_The_Scott_model_of_Linear_Logic_is_the_extensional_collapse_of_its_relational_model","29608076_Confluence_of_Pure_Differential_Nets_with_Promotion","29605084_The_algebraic_lambda-calculus","2381929_On_Kothe_Sequence_Spaces_and_Linear_Logic"]}
