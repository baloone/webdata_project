{"id":"303916911_On_an_MCS-based_inconsistency_measure","abstract":"An important problem in knowledge-based systems is inconsistency handling. This problem has recently been attracting a lot of attention in AI community. In this paper, we tackle the problem of evaluating the amount of conflicts in knowledge bases, and provide a new fine grained inconsistency measure, denoted , based on maximal consistent sets (MCSes). The main idea consists in quantifying the inconsistency of a knowledge base by considering that all its consistent pieces of information are possible. Furthermore, we provide an epistemic interpretation of our inconsistency measure using the multimodal logic . Then, we show that satisfies several state-of-the-art postulates. Moreover, we provide an encoding in integer linear programming for computing our inconsistency measure, which is defined from the set of MCSes. We also propose a Partial Max-SAT encoding, which allows us to avoid the computation of the MCSes. Finally, we provide a comparison between and two related existing inconsistency measures.","authors":["Meriem Ammoura","Yakoub Salhi","Brahim Oukacha","Raddaoui Badran"],"meta":["June 2016International Journal of Approximate Reasoning 80(14)","DOI:10.1016/j.ijar.2016.06.004"],"references":["271914121_Measuring_Inconsistency_in_Multi-Agent_Systems","262288770_Distance-Based_Measures_of_Inconsistency","256660078_Inconsistency_measures_for_probabilistic_logics","224943859_Measuring_Inconsistency_in_Probabilistic_Knowledge_Bases","221633097_Efficient_CNF_Encoding_of_Boolean_Cardinality_Constraints","220907435_Measuring_Consistency_Gain_and_Information_Loss_in_Stepwise_Inconsistency_Resolution","220813915_Measuring_conflict_and_agreement_between_two_prioritized_belief_bases","220811880_Quantifying_information_and_contradiction_in_propositional_logic_through_test_actions","220616298_Measuring_inconsistency_in_knowledgebases","220283588_A_general_framework_for_measuring_inconsistency_through_minimal_inconsistent_sets","38356197_Classifications_for_inconsistent_theories","29596665_Measuring_Inconsistency_in_DL-Lite_Ontologies","2479666_Quantifying_Information_and_Contradiction_in_Propositional_Logic_Through_Test_Actions","291072447_Revisiting_Postulates_for_Inconsistency_Measures","280787255_Inconsistency_Measurement_Thanks_to_MUS_Decomposition","266192314_Measuring_inconsistency_in_a_network_intrusion_detection_rule_set_based_on_Snort","242563585_On_the_Complexity_of_Derivation_in_Propositional_Calculus","227280985_Measuring_Inconsistency","226611442_Minimally_Inconsistent_LP","222826318_On_the_measure_of_conflicts_Shapley_Inconsistency_Values","222513209_How_to_act_on_inconsistent_news_Ignore_resolve_or_reject","221632878_Towards_an_Optimal_CNF_Encoding_of_Boolean_Cardinality_Constraints","221239895_A_Verification_Model_for_Electronic_Transaction_Protocols","220944478_On_Solving_the_Partial_MAX-SAT_Problem","220907727_How_Dirty_Is_Your_Relational_Database_An_Axiomatic_Approach"]}
