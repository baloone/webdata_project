{"id":"328837467_From_Mobility_Analysis_to_Mobility_Hubs_Discovery_A_Concept_Based_on_Using_CDR_Data_of_the_Mobile_Networks","abstract":"Understanding human mobility in dynamic environ- ments, such as our cities, is a crucial step toward the development of our economy, our environment, our transportation, as well as our well-being. Therefore, there is a need to rely on a sensor or a source of information, such as mobile phone data, that can help us to sense these urban dynamics. From this viewpoint, we are focusing on demonstrating and presenting our concept idea that relies on a new method based on switching Kalman filter that enables the extraction of mobility patterns and through its analysis discovering mobility hubs where the urban mobility converges or diverges using mobile data, especially CDR data.","authors":["Amnir Hadachi","Artjom Lind","Joonas LÃµmps","Peeter Piksarv"],"meta":["November 2018","DOI:10.1109/ICUMT.2018.8631200","Conference: THE 10TH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON ULTRA MODERN TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL SYSTEMSAt: Moscow, Russia","Project: Population Movement Analytics, Monitoring and Prediction Algorithms"],"references":["325887403_Are_Friends_of_My_Friends_Too_Social_Limitations_of_Location_Privacy_in_a_Socially-Connected_World","320734301_Spatio-Temporal_Mobility_Analysis_for_Community_Detection_in_the_Mobile_Networks_Using_CDR_Data","319241428_Clustering_Weekly_Patterns_of_Human_Mobility_Through_Mobile_Phone_Data","316727816_Towards_an_adaptive_completion_of_sparse_Call_Detail_Records_for_mobility_analysis","290194734_Mobility_Episode_Detection_from_CDR's_Data_using_Switching_Kalman_Filter","312484098_Administrative_Regions_Discovery_Based_on_Human_Mobility_Patterns_and_Spatio-Temporal_Clustering","304456762_Mercury_Metro_density_prediction_with_recurrent_neural_network_on_streaming_CDR_data","292773066_Mean_shift_towards_feature_space_analysis","259823296_Human_Mobility_Characterization_from_Cellular_Network_Data","251937631_A_dynamic_model_for_urban_population_density_estimation_using_mobile_phone_location_data"]}
