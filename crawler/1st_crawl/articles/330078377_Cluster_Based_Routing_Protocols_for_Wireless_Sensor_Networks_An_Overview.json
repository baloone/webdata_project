{"id":"330078377_Cluster_Based_Routing_Protocols_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_An_Overview","abstract":"Energy consumption of nodes in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is a very critical issue, particularly in scenarios where the energy of nodes cannot be recharged. Optimal routing approaches play a key role in energy utilization, so there is great importance of energy efficient routing protocols in WSNs. Energy efficient routing protocols in WSNs are categorized into four schemes, namely (i) communication model, (ii) topology based model, (iii) reliable routing, and (iv) network structure. Network structure category is further divided into flat and cluster-based approaches. This work focuses on a subtype of \"network structure\" scheme known as clustered based routing protocols, which are mainly used in WSNs for reduction in energy consumption. This work reviews and provides an overview of prominent cluster based energy efficient routing protocols on the basiss of some primary performance metrics such as (i) energy efficiency, (ii) algorithm complexity, (iii) scalability, (iv) data delivery delay, and (v) clustering approach. Finally, this work discusses some latest research trends with respect to cluster based energy efficient routing protocols in WSNs.
