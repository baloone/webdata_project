{"id":"341481715_Computer-supported_Collaborative_Learning_in_Programming_Education_A_Systematic_Literature_Review","abstract":"Social dimension plays a crucial role in the learning process. The use of technological resources to stimulate and mediate the interaction between students is known as Computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL). Despite being widely used in programming education, the summarization of the academic literature about this topic is scarce. To create that body of knowledge, a systematic literature review was performed. The findings provide an understanding of how collaboration is explored in introductory programming, resources used to stimulate them and challenges in the process. Opportunities for future research are discussed, especially related to motivation, self-efficacy and engagement in CSCL, and the exploitation of learning analytics.","authors":["Leonardo Soares","Antonio Jose Mendes","Anabela Gomes"],"meta":["May 2020","DOI:10.1109/EDUCON45650.2020.9125237","Conference: IEEE EDUCON2020 Global Engineering Education ConferenceAt: Porto, Portugal","Project: Autorregulação da aprendizagem em estudantes de programação: uma proposta de intervenção"],"references":["350186933_Collaborative_Virtual_Environments_for_Introductory_Programming_CVEIP","333789768_Ten_Years_of_Computer-Supported_Collaborative_Learning_A_meta-analysis_of_CSCL_in_STEM_education_during_2005-2014","331054055_Analysing_computational_thinking_in_collaborative_programming_A_quantitative_ethnography_approach","330475175_A_Collaborative_Learning_Approach_for_Integrated_Time_Based_Online_Environment","332744819_Pyrus_Designing_A_Collaborative_Programming_Game_to_Promote_Problem_Solving_Behaviors","331780697_The_Effectiveness_of_Scratch_in_Collaborative_Learning_on_Higher-Order_Thinking_Skills_in_Programming_Subject_Among_Year-Six_Students","331321842_Applying_learning_analytics_for_improving_students_engagement_and_learning_outcomes_in_an_MOOCs_enabled_collaborative_programming_course","330739960_Large-scale_path_modeling_of_remixing_to_computational_thinking","330664366_The_cloud_is_the_limit_A_case_study_of_programming_on_the_web_with_the_web","329513845_Towards_a_Personalized_Learning_Experience_Using_Reinforcement_Learning"]}
