{"id":"316482446_Systems_Engineering_and_Management_Processes_for_Small_Organizations_with_ISOIEC_29110_-_An_Implementation_in_a_Small_Public_Transportation_Company","abstract":"Most existing systems and software engineering standards, such as ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288, have been developed by and for large organizations not having in mind small and very small entities. As systems are getting bigger, customers as well as systems integrators must work with small suppliers. The new systems and software ISO/IEC 29110 series can be used by small entities such as enterprises or projects within a large organization to develop quality products. CSiT, a small public transportation company, has implemented the engineering and management processes of ISO/IEC 29110 and has recently been successfully audited by a third-party audit composed of 2 auditors. ISO/IEC 29110 was also implemented in CSiT as a good starting point towards implementing CMMI-DEV level 2 process areas and a few practices of Level 3.","authors":["Claude Y.
