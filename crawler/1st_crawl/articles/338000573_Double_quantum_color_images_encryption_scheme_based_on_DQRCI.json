{"id":"338000573_Double_quantum_color_images_encryption_scheme_based_on_DQRCI","abstract":"In this paper, a double quantum color images representation model (DQRCI) which can store two color digital images simultaneously into a quantum superposition state is investigated. Based on DQRCI, some simple image processing operations are discussed and the corresponding quantum circuits are designed. The circuits indicate that these operations have very low computational complexity. Moreover, to ensure the security of DQRCI quantum state image, an encryption scheme is proposed and the validity verification of image encryption system in quantum field is given for the first time. Numerical simulation and performance comparison demonstrate that the proposed double quantum color images encryption scheme outperforms the previous pertinent work in terms of security and computational complexity. This work will help the researchers to further investigate more efficient quantum image representation model and corresponding encryption algorithm.","authors":["Ling Wang","Qiwen Ran","Jing Ma"],"meta":["March 2020Multimedia Tools and Applications 79(6/7)","DOI:10.1007/s11042-019-08514-z"],"references":["328932411_Double_Quantum_Image_Encryption_Based_on_Arnold_Transform_and_Qubit_Random_Rotation","328318296_Quantum_Image_Encryption_Algorithm_Based_on_Quantum_Key_Image","326163829_An_Optimized_Quantum_Representation_for_Color_Digital_Images","325856566_A_quantum_color_image_encryption_scheme_based_on_coupled_hyper-chaotic_Lorenz_system_with_three_impulse_injections","324782403_Bit-level_quantum_color_image_encryption_scheme_with_quantum_cross-exchange_operation_and_hyper-chaotic_system","318578794_Quantum_watermarking_scheme_through_Arnold_scrambling_and_LSB_steganography","315941002_Quantum_image_processing_A_review_of_advances_in_its_security_technologies","315525875_A_Simple_Encryption_Algorithm_for_Quantum_Color_Image","311962365_A_novel_quantum_representation_of_color_digital_images","330318341_QRCI_A_new_quantum_representation_model_of_color_digital_images","308014520_Quantum_Color_Image_Encryption_Algorithm_Based_on_A_Hyper-Chaotic_System_and_Quantum_Fourier_Transform","301319179_Quantum_Realization_of_Arnold_Scrambling_for_IFRQI","299499164_Quantum_image_encryption_based_on_generalized_affine_transform_and_logistic_map","297663183_Quantum_Image_Encryption_Algorithm_Based_on_Quantum_Image_XOR_Operations","304107252_On_the_Effective_Subkey_Space_of_Some_Image_Encryption_Algorithms_using_External_Key"]}
