This version has several new features, including\noptions for adding unaligned sequences into an existing alignment, adjustment of direction in nucleotide alignment, constrained\nalignment and parallel processing, which were implemented after the previous major update. This report shows actual examples\nto explain how these features work, alone and in combination. Some examples incorrectly aligned by MAFFT are also shown to\nclarify its limitations. We discuss how to avoid misalignments, and our ongoing efforts to overcome such limitations.","authors":["Kazutaka Katoh","Daron M Standley"],"meta":["January 2013Molecular Biology and Evolution 30(4)","DOI:10.1093/molbev/mst010","SourcePubMed"],"references":["319331484_Generalized_affine_gap_costs_for_protein_sequence_alignment","301851979_pplacer_linear_time_maximum-likelihood_and_Bayesian_phylogenetic_placement_of_sequences_onto_a_fixed_reference_tree","235427983_PROMALS3D_a_tool_for_multiple_sequence_and_structure_alignment","303167148_CLUSTAL_W_Improving_the_sensitivity_of_progressive_multiple_sequence_alignment_through_sequence_weighting_position-specific_gap_penalties_and_weight_matrix_choice","285699227_Improved_accuracy_of_multiple_ncRNA_alignment_by_incorporating_16_structural_11_information_into_a_MAFFT-based_framework","281609620_Parallelization_of_the_MAFFT_multiple_sequence_alignment_program","277508262_Katoh_K_Misawa_K_Kuma_KI_Miyata_T_MAFFT_a_novel_method_for_rapid_multiple_sequence_alignment_based_on_fast_Fourier_transform_Nucleic_Acids_Res_30_3059-3066","258147990_MAFFT_Iterative_Refinement_and_Additional_Methods","243677972_A_Strategy_For_The_Rapid_Multiple_Alignment_Of_Protein_Sequences","233596044_MAFFT_A_novel_method_for_rapid_multiple_sequence_alignment_based_on_fast_Fourier_transform"]}
