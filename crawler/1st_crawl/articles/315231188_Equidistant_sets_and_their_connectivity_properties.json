{"id":"315231188_Equidistant_sets_and_their_connectivity_properties","abstract":"If A and B are nonvoid subsets of a metric space (X, d), the set of points x âˆŠ X for which d(x, A) = d(x, B) is called the equidistant set determined by A and B. Among other results, it is shown that if A and B are connected and X is Euclidean 22-space, then the equidistant set determined by A and B is connected.","authors":["J. B.
