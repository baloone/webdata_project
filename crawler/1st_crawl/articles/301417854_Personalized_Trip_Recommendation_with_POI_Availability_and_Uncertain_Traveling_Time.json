{"id":"301417854_Personalized_Trip_Recommendation_with_POI_Availability_and_Uncertain_Traveling_Time","abstract":"As location-based social network (LBSN) services become increas- ingly popular, trip recommendation that recommends a sequence of points of interest (POIs) to visit for a user emerges as one of many important applications of LBSNs. Personalized trip recommenda- tion tailors to users’ specific tastes by learning from past check-in behaviors of users and their peers. Finding the optimal trip that maximizes user’s experiences for a given time budget constraint is an NP hard problem and previous solutions do not consider two practical and important constraints. One constraint is POI avail- ability where a POI may be only available during a certain time window. Another constraint is uncertain traveling time where the traveling time between two POIs is uncertain. This work presents efficient solutions to personalized trip recommendation by incorpo- rating these constraints to prune the search space. We evaluated the efficiency and effectiveness of our solutions on real life LBSN data sets.","authors":["Chenyi Zhang","Hongwei Liang","Ke Wang","Jianling Sun"],"meta":["October 2015","DOI:10.1145/2806416.2806558","Conference: the 24th ACM International"],"references":["286950487_Where_you_like_to_go_next_Successive_point-of-interest_recommendation","275532549_Estimating_Travel_Time_Distribution_Under_Different_Traffic_Conditions","262377924_Multi-Modal_Journey_Planning_in_the_Presence_of_Uncertainty","304377735_Are_Features_Equally_Representative_A_Feature-Centric_Recommendation","295699887_Matrix_factorization_techniques_for_recommender_systems","285809856_Fused_matrix_factorization_with_geographical_and_social_influence_in_location-based_social_networks","278690128_Knapsack_Problems","266660447_A_cost-effective_recommender_system_for_taxi_drivers","266654624_Spatial_topic_modeling_in_online_social_media_for_location_recommendation","264345170_A_Normal_Limit_Theorem_for_Power_Sums_of_Normal_Random_Variables","262242965_Personalized_trip_recommendation_with_multiple_constraints_by_mining_user_check-in_behaviors","262250389_Geo_topic_model_Joint_modeling_of_user's_activity_area_and_interests_for_location_recommendation","262173126_LCARS_a_location-content-aware_recommender_system","261960760_Customized_Tour_Recommendations_in_Urban_Areas","261860600_Learning_geographical_preferences_for_point-of-interest_recommendation"]}
