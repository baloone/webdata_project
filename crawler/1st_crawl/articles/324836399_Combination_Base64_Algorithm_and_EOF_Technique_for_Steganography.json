{"id":"324836399_Combination_Base64_Algorithm_and_EOF_Technique_for_Steganography","abstract":"The steganography process combines mathematics and computer science. Steganography consists of a set of methods and techniques to embed the data into another media so that the contents are unreadable to anyone who does not have the authority to read these data. The main objective of the use of base64 method is to convert any file in order to achieve privacy. This paper discusses a steganography and encoding method using base64, which is a set of encoding schemes that convert the same binary data to the form of a series of ASCII code. Also, the EoF technique is used to embed encoding text performed by Base64. As an example, for the mechanisms a file is used to represent the texts, and by using the two methods together will increase the security level for protecting the data, this research aims to secure many types of files in a particular media with a good security and not to damage the stored files and coverage media that used.","authors":["Robbi Rahim","Heri Nurdiyanto","Rahmat Hidayat","Ansari Saleh Ahmar"],"meta":["April 2018Journal of Physics Conference Series 1007(1):012003","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/1007/1/012003","Project: Computer Science"],"references":["322510408_Enhanced_pixel_value_differencing_steganography_with_government_standard_algorithm","322220654_Combination_of_the_Blowfish_and_Lempel-Ziv-Welch_algorithms_for_text_compression","321801412_Symmetric_Stream_Cipher_using_Triple_Transposition_Key_Method_and_Base64_Algorithm_for_Security_Improvement","310021260_Cryptography_Technique_with_Modular_Multiplication_Block_Cipher_and_Playfair_Cipher","309676054_Study_of_Three_Pass_Protocol_on_Data_Security","309463059_Arnold's_Cat_Map_Algorithm_in_Digital_Image_Encryption","307558328_Dynamic_Key_Matrix_of_Hill_Cipher_Using_Genetic_Algorithm","311100538_The_application_of_hybrid_encryption_algorithm_in_software_security","282299416_Hiding_Secret_Information_Using_LSB_Based_Audio_Steganography","276243636_A_Steganography_Approach_over_Video_Images_to_Improve_Security"]}
