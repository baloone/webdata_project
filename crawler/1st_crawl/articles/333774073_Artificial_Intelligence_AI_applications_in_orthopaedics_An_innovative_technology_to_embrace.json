AI is the process of human-like intelligence simulated by using computer-controlled machines. It includes information, reasoning, and self-correction capability. AI is used with intelligent robots and the associated machinery to perform orthopaedics surgery accurately. These systems can detect mistakes in the given environment and provide actionable information regarding heat, light, movement, temperature, sound, and pressure and thus minimizing human errors.","authors":["Abid Haleem","Raju Vaishya","Mohd Javaid","Ibrahim Haleem Khan"],"meta":["June 2019Journal of Clinical Orthopaedics and Trauma 11(Suppl 1)","DOI:10.1016/j.jcot.2019.06.012","Projects: publicationPUBLICATION"],"references":["332536137_Industry_40_applications_in_medical_field_A_brief_review","330813916_Artificial_Intelligence_vs_Natural_Stupidity_Evaluating_AI_readiness_for_the_Vietnamese_Medical_Information_System","318255127_Artificial_intelligence_for_analyzing_orthopedic_trauma_radiographs_Deep_learning_algorithms-are_they_on_par_with_humans_for_diagnosing_fractures","307986690_COMPUTATIONAL_ANALYSIS_BASED_ON_ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORKS_FOR_AIDING_IN_DIAGNOSING_OSTEOARTHRITIS_OF_THE_LUMBAR_SPINE","287164566_Computational_analysis_based_on_artificial_neural_networks_for_aiding_in_diagnosing_osteoarthritis_of_the_lumbar_spine","276859420_Fundamentals_of_Clinical_Outcomes_Assessment_for_Spinal_Disorders_Clinical_Outcome_Instruments_and_Applications","333225866_Artificial_Intelligence_in_Health_Care_Will_the_Value_Match_the_Hype","327947052_Industry_40_and_its_applications_in_orthopaedics","325748673_Artificial_Intelligence_Bayesian_versus_Heuristic_Method_for_Diagnostic_Decision_Support"]}
