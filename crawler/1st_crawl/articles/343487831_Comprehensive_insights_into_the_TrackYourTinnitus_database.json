{"id":"343487831_Comprehensive_insights_into_the_TrackYourTinnitus_database","abstract":"The ubiquity of smart mobile devices facilitates data collection in the healthcare domain. Two of the concepts, which can be applied in this context, are mobile crowdsensing (MCS) and ecological momentary assessment (EMA). TrackYourTinnitus (TYT) is an advanced mobile healthcare platform that combines both concepts enabling the monitoring and evaluation of the usersâ€™ individual variability of tinnitus symptoms. This paper describes the underlying data set and structure of the TYT mobile platform and highlights selected issues whose investigation provides advanced insights into the users of this mobile platform as well as their data.","authors":["Robin Kraft","Michael Stach","Manfred Reichert","Winfried Schlee"],"meta":["January 2020Procedia Computer Science 175:28-35","DOI:10.1016/j.procs.2020.07.008"],"references":["339575147_Combining_Mobile_Crowdsensing_and_Ecological_Momentary_Assessments_in_the_Healthcare_Domain","335203420_A_Classification_Framework_of_Mobile_Health_CrowdSensing_Research_A_Scoping_Review","335101039_Machine_Learning_Findings_on_Geospatial_Data_of_Users_from_the_TrackYourStress_mHealth_Crowdsensing_Platform","326369194_Towards_Incentive_Management_Mechanisms_in_the_Context_of_Crowdsensing_Technologies_based_on_TrackYourTinnitus_Insights","311232996_Measuring_the_Moment-to-Moment_Variability_of_Tinnitus_The_TrackYourTinnitus_Smart_Phone_App","249646058_Single-Patient_N-of-1_Trials_A_Pragmatic_Clinical_Decision_Methodology_for_Patient-Centered_Comparative_Effectiveness_Research","336953162_Connecting_Domains-Ecological_Momentary_Assessment_in_a_Mobile_Sensing_Framework","336953105_Mobile_Crowdsensing_in_Healthcare_Scenarios_Taxonomy_Conceptual_Pillars_Smart_Mobile_Crowdsensing_Services","277564819_Incentives_for_Mobile_Crowd_Sensing_A_Survey","246004660_Ecological_momentary_assessment_EMA_in_behavioral_medicine"]}
