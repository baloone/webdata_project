{"id":"342624633_Intelligent_buildings_An_overview","abstract":"The objective of this paper is to review the topics related to the optimized operation of intelligent buildings with respect to occupant comfort and energy consumption. To simultaneously optimize energy costs and indoor environmental quality, intelligent buildings should consider several continuously changing inputs including energy exchange processes across the building, sets of indoor and outdoor environmental parameters, energy prices, occupants' presence, preferences, and behavior inside the building. Therefore, a well-structured framework supported by computational intelligence and optimization methods , environmental monitoring, and behavior modeling techniques, as well as comfort, productivity, and behavioral studies, are required to make optimal decisions for the indoor environment. In this paper, the main concepts, challenges, the latest studies, findings, and developments related to the six topics of (1) Occupant comfort conditions; (2) Occupant productivity; (3) Building control; (4) Computational optimization ; (5) Occupant behavior modeling; (6) Environmental monitoring and analysis, in offices, commercial and residential buildings are reviewed. Moreover, future directions and challenges related to the optimized operation of intelligent buildings are discussed.","authors":["Farhad Mofidi","Hashem Akbari"],"meta":["September 2020Energy and
