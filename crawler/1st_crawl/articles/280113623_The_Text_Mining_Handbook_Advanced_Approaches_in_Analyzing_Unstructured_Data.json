{"id":"280113623_The_Text_Mining_Handbook_Advanced_Approaches_in_Analyzing_Unstructured_Data","abstract":"Text mining tries to solve the crisis of information overload by combining techniques from data mining, machine learning, natural language processing, information retrieval, and knowledge management. In addition to providing an in-depth examination of core text mining and link detection algorithms and operations, this book examines advanced pre-processing techniques, knowledge representation considerations, and visualization approaches. Finally, it explores current real-world, mission-critical applications of text mining and link detection in such varied fields as M&A business intelligence, genomics research and counter-terrorism activities.","authors":["Ronen Feldman","James Sanger"],"meta":["December 2006","DOI:10.1017/CBO9780511546914","Publisher: Cambridge University PressISBN: 9780521836579"],"references":[]}
