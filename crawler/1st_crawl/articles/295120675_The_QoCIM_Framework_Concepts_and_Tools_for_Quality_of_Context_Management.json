{"id":"295120675_The_QoCIM_Framework_Concepts_and_Tools_for_Quality_of_Context_Management","abstract":"In the last decade, several works proposed their own list of quality of context (QoC) criteria. This chapter relates a comparative study of these successive propositions and shows that no consensus has been reached about the semantic and the comprehensiveness of QoC criteria. Facing this situation, the QoCIM meta-model offers a generic, computable and expressive solution to handle and exploit any QoC criterion within distributed context managers and context-aware applications. For validation purposes, the key modelling features of QoCIM are illustrated as well as the tool chain that provides developers with QoCIM based models editor and code generator. With the tool chain, developers are able to define and use their own QoC criteria within context and quality aware applications","authors":["Pierrick MARIE","Thierry Desprats","Sophie Chabridon","Michelle Sibilla"],"meta":["December 2014","DOI:10.1007/978-1-4939-1887-4_11","ISBN: 978-1-4939-1886-7"],"references":["282863807_QoCIM_A_meta-model_for_quality_of_context","237142151_Trust_and_privacy_management_support_for_context-aware_service_platforms","230627476_A_Survey_of_Context_Data_Distribution_for_Mobile_Ubiquitous_Systems","228541796_Quality_of_Context_Models_and_Applications_for_Context-aware_Systems_in_Pervasive_Environments","221037039_Middleware_Support_for_Quality_of_Context_in_Pervasive_Context-Aware_Systems","305301888_International_Vocabulary_of_Metrology_--_Basic_and_General_Concepts_and_Associated_Terms","281881375_INCOME-Multi-scale_Context_Management_for_the_Internet_of_Things","281660508_CxtBAC_A_family_of_context-based_access_control_models_for_Pervasive_Environments","232654056_A_Quality_Measurement_Method_of_Context_Information_in_Ubiquitous_Environments","221277996_A_Framework_for_Quality_of_Context_Management","4061357_Modelling_and_using_imperfect_context_information"]}
