{"id":"2995027_On_the_Use_of_Windows_for_Harmonic_Analysis_With_the_Discrete_Fourier_Transform","abstract":"This paper makes available a concise review of data windows and their affect on the detection of harmonic signals in the presence of broad-band noise, and in the presence of nearby strong harmonic interference. We also call attention to a number of common errors in the application of windows when used with the fast Fourier transform. This paper includes a comprehensive catalog of data windows along with their significant performance parameters from which the different windows can be compared. Finally, an example demonstrates the use and value of windows to resolve closely spaced harmonic signals characterized by large differences in amplitude.","authors":["fred joel harris"],"meta":["February 1978Proceedings of the IEEE 66(1):51 - 83","DOI:10.1109/PROC.1978.10837","SourceIEEE Xplore"],"references":["267071976_System_Analysis_by_Digital_Computer","254331447_Mathematical_Considerations_in_the_Estimation_of_Spectra","252542141_High-resolution_spectral_analysis_with_arbitrary_spectral_centers_and_arbitrary_spectral_resolutions","245462536_Approximate_Fourier_analysis_of_distribution_functions","243776094_An_introduction_to_the_calculations_of_numerical_spectrum_analysis","243386727_Statistical_Theory_Of_Signal_Detection","242511027_The_Measurement_of_Power_Spectra","238682209_General_Considerations_in_the_Analysis_of_Spectra","226978984_Untersuchungen_uber_Fouriersche_Reihen","200524477_Prolate_Spheroidal_Wave_Functions_Fourier_Analysis_and_Uncertainty_-_I"]}
