{"id":"278688201_A_new_pedestrian_detection_method_based_on_combined_HOG_and_LSS_features","abstract":"Pedestrian detection is a critical issue in computer vision, with several feature descriptors can be adopted. Since the ability of various kinds of feature descriptor is different in pedestrian detection and there is no basis in feature selection, we analyze the commonly used features in theory and compare them in experiments. It is desired to find a new feature with the strongest description ability from their pair-wise combinations. In experiments, INRIA database and Daimler database are adopted as the training and testing set. By theoretic analysis, we find the HOG–LSS combined feature have more comprehensive description ability. At first, Adaboost is regarded as classifier and the experimental results show that the description ability of the new combination features is improved on the basis of the single feature and HOG–LSS combined feature has the strongest description ability. For further verifying this conclusion, SVM classifier is used in the experiment. The detection performance is evaluated by miss rate, the false positives per window, and the false positives per image. The results of these indicators further prove that description ability of HOG–LSS feature is better than other combination of these features.","authors":["Shihong Yao","Shaoming Pan","Tao Wang","Chunhou Zheng"],"meta":["March 2015Neurocomputing 151:1006-1014","DOI:10.1016/j.neucom.2014.08.080"],"references":["226326170_Neural_Correlation_of_Global-first_Topological_Perception_Anterior_Temporal_Lobe","224164350_New_Features_and_Insights_for_Pedestrian_Detection","221111492_Detecting_Pedestrians_Using_Patterns_of_Motion_and_Appearance","220660132_Detecting_Pedestrians_Using_Patterns_of_Motion_and_Appearance","220660094_Robust_Real-Time_Face_Detection","3428028_Combination_of_Feature_Extraction_Methods_for_SVM_Pedestrian_Detection","262020137_MutualCascade_Method_for_Pedestrian_Detection","257014892_Fast_Local_Self-Similarity_for_describing_interest_regions","228815994_The_topological_approach_to_perceptual_organization","226085940_Fast_algorithm_for_maneuvering_target_detection_in_SAR_imagery_based_on_gridding_and_fusion_of_texture_features","222564227_Palmprint_recognition_using_FastICA_algorithm_and_radial_basis_probabilistic_neural_network","222407561_Human_face_recognition_based_on_multi-features_using_neural_networks_committee","221411660_Co-occurrence_Histograms_of_Oriented_Gradients_for_Pedestrian_Detection","221113895_A_Performance_Evaluation_of_Single_and_Multi-feature_People_Detection","200038910_Distinctive_Image_Features_from_Scale-Invariant_Keypoints","51539292_Pedestrian_Detection_An_Evaluation_of_the_State_of_the_Art","45200127_Object_Detection_with_Discriminatively_Trained_Part-Based_Models","23569678_A_Constructive_Hybrid_Structure_Optimization_Methodology_for_Radial_Basis_Probabilistic_Neural_Networks","16064048_Topological_Structure_in_Visual_Perception","3193420_Multiresolution_Gray-Scale_and_Rotation_Invariant_Texture_Classification_with_Local_Binary_Patterns"]}
