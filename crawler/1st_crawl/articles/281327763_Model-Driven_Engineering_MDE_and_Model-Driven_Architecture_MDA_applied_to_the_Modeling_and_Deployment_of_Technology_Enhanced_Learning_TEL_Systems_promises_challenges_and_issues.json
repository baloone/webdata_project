Such Software Engineering approaches provide concrete benefits (productivity, interoperability, adaptability) by means of intensive uses of models, meta-models and transformations. Such benefits can also be met in a TEL context. Because computer scientists or engineers cannot currently find well-defined frameworks about this new trend, we have chosen to report recent results of our working group (initiated in 2003) in order to provide readers with a survival kit. Our results, illustrated in this chapter, argue that model-driven engineering can help designers to reduce the gap between specific instructional requirements (domain point of view) and the software architectures that practically support the implementation, the run-time and the regulation of this instruction.","authors":["Pierre Laforcade","Thierry Nodenot","Christophe Choquet","Pierre-Andr√© Caron"],"meta":["November 2007","DOI:10.4018/978-1-59904-633-4.ch007"],"references":["229424211_A_Classification_Framework_for_Educational_Modeling_Languages","229061915_CONFIGURING_A_WEB-BASED_TOOL_THROUGH_PEDAGOGICAL_SCENARIOS","229061914_Construire_des_dispositifs_sur_la_plateforme_Moodle_application_de_l'ingenierie_Bricoles","228770544_Atl-eclipse_support_for_model_transformation","228630349_A_classification_framework_for_educational_modeling_languages_in_instructional_design","295472881_RAM3_un_outil_dynamique_pour_le_Meta-Object_Facility","279257504_Web_services_plug-in_to_implement_complex_pedagogical_set_on_LMS_and_Web_application","234101280_Domain-Specific_Modeling","228750343_YATL_Yet_another_transformation_language","224620038_Towards_a_UML-based_Educational_Modeling_Language"]}
