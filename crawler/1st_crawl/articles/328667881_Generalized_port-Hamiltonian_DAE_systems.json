{"id":"328667881_Generalized_port-Hamiltonian_DAE_systems","abstract":"Motivated by recent work in this area we expand on a generalization of port-Hamiltonian systems that is obtained by replacing the Hamiltonian function representing energy storage by a Lagrangian subspace. This leads to a new class of algebraic constraints and DAE systems in physical systems modeling. It is shown how Dirac structures and Lagrangian subspaces allow for similar representations, and how this can be exploited to convert algebraic constraints originating from Dirac structures into algebraic constraints corresponding to Lagrangian subspaces, and conversely.","authors":["Arjan van der Schaft","Bernhard Maschke"],"meta":["November 2018Systems & Control Letters 121:31-37","DOI:10.1016/j.sysconle.2018.09.008"],"references":[]}
