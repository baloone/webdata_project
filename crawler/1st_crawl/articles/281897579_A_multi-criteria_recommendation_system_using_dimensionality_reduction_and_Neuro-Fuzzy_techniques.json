{"id":"281897579_A_multi-criteria_recommendation_system_using_dimensionality_reduction_and_Neuro-Fuzzy_techniques","abstract":"Multi-criteria collaborative filtering (MC-CF) presents a possibility to provide accurate recommendations by considering the user preferences in multiple aspects of items. However, scalability and sparsity are two main problems in MC-CF which this paper attempts to solve them using dimensionality reduction and Neuro-Fuzzy techniques. Considering the user behavior about itemsâ€™ features which is frequently vague, imprecise and subjective, we solve the sparsity problem using Neuro-Fuzzy technique. For the scalability problem, higher order singular value decomposition along with supervised learning (classification) methods is used. Thus, the objective of this paper is to propose a new recommendation model to improve the recommendation quality and predictive accuracy of MC-CF and solve the scalability and alleviate the sparsity problems in the MC-CF. The experimental results of applying these approaches on Yahoo!Movies and TripAdvisor datasets with several comparisons are presented to show the enhancement of MC-CF recommendation quality and predictive accuracy. The experimental results demonstrate that SVM dominates the K-NN and FBNN in improving the MC-CF predictive accuracy evaluated by most broadly popular measurement metrics, F1 and mean absolute error. In addition, the experimental results also demonstrate that the combination of Neuro-Fuzzy and dimensionality reduction techniques remarkably improves the recommendation quality and predictive accuracy of MC-CF in relation to the previous recommendation techniques based on multi-criteria ratings.","authors":["Mehrbakhsh Nilashi","Assoc Prof. Dr. Othman Ibrahim","Associate Professor Dr Nora Ithnin","Rozana Zakaria"],"meta":["November 2015Soft Computing 19(11)","DOI:10.1007/s00500-014-1475-6"],"references":["287952023_Collaborative_Filtering_Recommender_Systems","280990412_Measuring_Semantic_Similarity_in_Grids_Using_Ontology","262256284_On_the_best_rank-1_and_rank-R_1_R_2_R_N_approximation_of_higher-order_tensors","257310865_A_K-nearest_neighbours_method_based_on_imprecise_probabilities","250301498_Collaborative_Filtering_with_Multicomponent_Rating_for_Recommender_Systems","242104348_Item-based_top-_N_recommendation_algorithms","241623236_Accuracy_improvements_for_multi-criteria_recommender_systems","235900822_Analysis_of_the_effects_of_valve_propagated_pressure_surge_on_pipe_flow","235706230_A_neuro-fuzzy_collaborative_filtering_approach_for_Web_recommendation","235357340_Empirical_Analysis_of_Predictive_Algorithm_for_Collaborative_Filtering","233932671_Fuzzy_Model_Identification_Based_on_Cluster_Estimation","227087925_Developing_Constraint-based_Recommenders","226514122_SSVM_A_Smooth_Support_Vector_Machine_for_Classification","225924875_Data_Mining_Methods_for_Recommender_Systems","225645821_Finding_Preferred_Query_Relaxations_in_Content-Based_Recommenders","225164137_Speeding_up_the_scaled_conjugate_gradient_algorithm_and_its_application_in_neuro-fuzzy_classifier_training","224529449_Classification_of_EEG_signals_using_Dempster_Shafer_theory_and_a_K-nearest_neighbor_classifier","224181293_Multi-scale_Support_Vector_Regression","313063011_Feature_Extraction_for_a_Multiple_Pattern_Classification_Neural_Network_System","307881957_LIBSVM_A_library_for_support_vector_machines","301222357_Toward_the_next_generation_of_recommender_systems_A_survey_of_the_state-of-the-art_and_possible_extensions","285278428_Text_Categorization_with_Support_Vector_Machines_Learning_with_Many_Relevant_Features","285200109_Application_of_k-nearest_Neighbour_predictor_for_classifying_trust_of_B2C_customers","278695382_The_Nature_of_Statistical_Learning_Theory","272176868_Finding_Groups_in_Data_An_Introduction_to_Cluster_Analysis","269779468_A_Comparative_Study_of_Adaptive_Neuro_Fuzzy_Inferences_System_ANFIS_and_Fuzzy_Inference_System_FIS_Approach_for_Trust_in_B2C_Electronic_Commerce_Websites","267829467_An_Application_Expert_System_for_Evaluating_Effective_Factors_on_Trust_in_B2C_Websites","265103457_Improving_Recommendation_Accuracy_Based_on_Item-Specific_Tag_Preferences","262149571_Hierarchical_Approach_for_Multiscale_Support_Vector_Regression","261467950_Hybrid_recommendation_system_based_on_collaborative_filtering_and_fuzzy_numbers","260026988_Multi-criteria_collaborative_filtering_with_high_accuracy_using_higher_order_singular_value_decomposition_and_Neuro-Fuzzy_system","260006814_Hybrid_recommendation_approaches_for_multi-criteria_collaborative_filtering","259810724_A_Model_for_Detecting_Customer_Level_Intentions_to_Purchase_in_B2C_Websites_Using_TOPSIS_and_Fuzzy_Logic_Rule-Based_System","257635770_Cluster_ensembles_in_collaborative_filtering_recommendation","257404071_A_literature_review_and_classification_of_recommender_systems_research_Expert_Systems_with_Applications_3911_10059-10072","257160533_Evaluating_collaborative_filtering_recommendations_inside_large_learning_object_repositories","257160464_A_scalable_privacy-preserving_recommendation_scheme_via_bisecting_k-means_clustering","252069018_Recommender_Systems_An_Introduction","251574642_A_collaborative_filtering_similarity_measure_based_on_singularities","245441758_Application_of_Dimensionality_Reduction_in_Recommender_Systems","243763580_The_Nature_Of_Statistical_Learning_Theory","243761411_Industrial_Application_of_Fuzzy_Control","242154328_Recommending_Products_with_a_Fuzzy_Classification","241103054_Incremental_Collaborative_Filtering_recommender_based_on_Regularized_Matrix_Factorization","237127820_Finding_Groups_in_Data_An_Introduction_to_Cluster_Analysis","232615810_An_Item_Based_Collaborative_Filtering_Using_BP_Neural_Networks_Prediction","228799065_Recommender_Systems_Using_Linear_Classifiers","228715647_LIBSVM_A_library_for_support_vector_machines","227512859_First-order_perturbation_analysis_of_the_best_rank-R1_R2_R3_approximation_in_multilinear_algebra","226551595_kNN_Versus_SVM_in_the_Collaborative_Filtering_Framework"]}
