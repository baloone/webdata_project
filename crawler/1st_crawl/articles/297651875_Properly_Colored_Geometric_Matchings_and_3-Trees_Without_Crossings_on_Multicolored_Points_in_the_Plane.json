{"id":"297651875_Properly_Colored_Geometric_Matchings_and_3-Trees_Without_Crossings_on_Multicolored_Points_in_the_Plane","abstract":"Let \\(X\\) be a set of multicolored points in the plane such that no three points are collinear and each color appears on at most \\(\\lceil |X|/2 \\rceil \\) points. We show the existence of a non-crossing properly colored geometric perfect matching on \\(X\\) (if \\(|X|\\) is even), and the existence of a non-crossing properly colored geometric spanning tree with maximum degree at most \\(3\\) on \\(X\\). Moreover, we show the existence of a non-crossing properly colored geometric perfect matching in the plane lattice. In order to prove these our results, we propose an useful lemma that gives a good partition of a sequence of multicolored points.","authors":["Mikio Kano","Kazuhiro Suzuki","Miyuki Uno"],"meta":["November 2014","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-13287-7_9","Conference: Japanese Conference on Discrete and Computational Geometry and Graphs"],"references":["316823755_Problem-Solving_Through_Problems","265917512_Discrete_Geometry_on_Red_and_Blue_Points_on_the_Plane_Lattice","257406794_Vertex-Colored_Encompassing_Graphs","228600739_Discrete_Geometry_on_Red_and_Blue_Points_in_the_Plane_-_A_Survey_-","221584433_On_the_Maximum_Degree_of_Bipartite_Embeddings_of_Trees_in_the_Plane"]}
