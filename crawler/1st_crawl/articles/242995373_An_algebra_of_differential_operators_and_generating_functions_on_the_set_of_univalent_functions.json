{"id":"242995373_An_algebra_of_differential_operators_and_generating_functions_on_the_set_of_univalent_functions","abstract":"With a method close to that of Kirillov [4], we define sequences of vector fields on the set of univalent functions and we construct systems of partial differential equations which have the sequence of the Faber polynomials (Fn) as a solution. Through the Faber polynomials and Grunsky coefficients, we obtain the generating functions for some of the sequences of vector fields.","authors":["Hélène Airault","Jiagang Ren"],"meta":["June 2002Bulletin des Sciences Mathématiques 126(5):343-367","DOI:10.1016/S0007-4497(02)01115-6"],"references":["284675722_Faber_polynomials_in_the_theory_of_univalent_functions","267052910_Inequalities_in_the_theory_of_univalent_functions","266364619_The_Bieberbach_conjecture","242367421_The_Kernel_Function_and_Conformal_Mapping","229336433_Unitarizing_probability_measures_for_representations_of_Virasoro_algebra","229311092_Geometric_approach_to_discrete_series_of_unirreps_for_Vir","221999366_Representations_of_the_Virasoro_algebra_by_the_orbit_method"]}
