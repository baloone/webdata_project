{"id":"2367122_Data_Science_An_Action_Plan_for_Expanding_the_Technical_Areas_of_the_Field_of_Statistics","abstract":"An action plan to enlarge the technical areas of statistics focuses on the data analyst. The plan sets out six technical areas of work for a university department and advocates a specific allocation of resources devoted to research in each area and to courses in each area. The value of technical work is judged by the extent to which it benefits the data analyst, either directly or indirectly. The plan is also applicable to government research labs and corporate research organizations. 1 Summary of the Plan This document describes a plan to enlarge the major areas of technical work of the field of statistics. Because the plan is ambitious and implies substantial change, the altered field will be called \"data science.\" The focus of the plan is the practicing data analyst. A basic premise is that technical areas of data science should be judged by the extent to which they enable the analyst to learn from data. The benefit of an area can be direct or indirect.
