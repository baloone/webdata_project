{"id":"221260516_Helios_Web-based_Open-Audit_Voting","abstract":"Voting with cryptographic auditing, sometimes called open-audit voting, has remained, for the most part, a the- oretical endeavor. In spite of dozens of fascinating pro- tocols and recent ground-breaking advances in the field, there exist only a handful of specialized implementations that few people have experienced directly. As a result, the benefits of cryptographically audited elections have remained elusive. We present Helios, the first web-based, open-audit voting system. Helios is publicly accessible today: any- one can create and run an election, and any willing ob- server can audit the entire process. Helios is ideal for on- line software communities, local clubs, student govern- ment, and other environments where trustworthy, secret- ballot elections are required but coercion is not a serious concern. With Helios, we hope to expose many to the power of open-audit elections.","authors":["Ben Adida"],"meta":["January 2008","SourceDBLP","Conference: Proceedings of the 17th USENIX Security Symposium, July 28-August 1, 2008, San Jose, CA, USA"],"references":["228364877_A_secure_electronic_voting_scheme","220336572_Coercion-Resistant_Electronic_Elections","2572744_How_To_Prove_Yourself_Practical_Solutions_to_Identification_and_Signature_Problems","277296516_Advances_in_Cryptographic_Voting_Systems","242740749_Ballot_Casting_Assurance_via_Voter-Initiated_Poll_Station_Auditing","239666275_The_data_URL_scheme","234796036_Simple_verifiable_elections","221609876_A_Verifiable_Secret_Shuffle_and_its_Application_to_E-Voting","221355148_Wallet_Databases_with_Observers","221348754_Receipt-Free_Mix-Type_Voting_Scheme_-_A_Practical_Solution_to_the_Implementation_of_a_Voting_Booth","220881427_Python_Programming_Language","35520801_Secure_electronic_voting_over_the_World_Wide_Web","2328826_The_Secure_Remote_Password_Protocol"]}
