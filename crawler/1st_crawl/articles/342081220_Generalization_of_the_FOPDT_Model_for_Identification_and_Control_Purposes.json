{"id":"342081220_Generalization_of_the_FOPDT_Model_for_Identification_and_Control_Purposes","abstract":"This paper proposes a theoretical framework for generalization of the well established first order plus dead time (FOPDT) model for linear systems. The FOPDT model has been broadly used in practice to capture essential dynamic response of real life processes for the purpose of control design systems. Recently, the model has been revisited towards a generalization of its orders, i.e., non-integer Laplace order and fractional order delay. This paper investigates the stability margins as they vary with each generalization step. The relevance of this generalization has great implications in both the identification of dynamic processes as well as in the controller parameter design of dynamic feedback closed loops. The discussion section addresses in detail each of this aspect and points the reader towards the potential unlocked by this contribution.","authors":["Cristina Muresan","Clara Mihaela Ionescu"],"meta":["June 2020Processes 8(6):682","DOI:10.3390/pr8060682"],"references":["340623031_The_Potential_of_Fractional_Order_Distributed_MPC_Applied_to_SteamWater_Loop_in_Large_Scale_Ships","337645308_Fractional-order_modeling_of_impedance_measurements_in_a_blood-resembling_experimental_setup","337638087_Experiment_Design_and_Estimation_Methodology_of_Varying_Properties_for_Non-Newtonian_Fluids","333682048_Back_to_Basics_Meaning_of_the_Parameters_of_Fractional_Order_PID_Controllers","333335282_A_Survey_on_Fractional_Order_Control_Techniques_for_Unmanned_Aerial_and_Ground_Vehicles","338091052_Identification_for_control_of_suspended_objects_in_non-Newtonian_fluids","337640286_First_Order_Plus_Frequency_Dependent_Delay_Modeling_New_Perspective_or_Mathematical_Curiosity","337392840_Hands-on_MPC_tuning_for_industrial_applications","335887715_Universal_Direct_Tuner_for_Loop_Control_in_Industry","335199091_Robust_Estimation_of_a_SOPDT_Model_from_Highly_Corrupted_Step_Response_Data"]}
