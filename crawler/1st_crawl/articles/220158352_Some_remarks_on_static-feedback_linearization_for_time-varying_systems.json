{"id":"220158352_Some_remarks_on_static-feedback_linearization_for_time-varying_systems","abstract":"This work summarizes some results about static state feedback linearization for time-varying systems. Three different necessary and sufficient conditions are stated in this paper. The first condition is the one by [Sluis, W. M. (1993). A necessary condition for dynamic feedback linearization. Systems & Control Letters, 21, 277–283]. The second and the third are the generalizations of known results due respectively to [Aranda-Bricaire, E., Moog, C. H., Pomet, J. B. (1995). A linear algebraic framework for dynamic feedback linearization. IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 40, 127–132] and to [Jakubczyk, B., Respondek, W. (1980). On linearization of control systems. Bulletin del’Academie Polonaise des Sciences. Serie des Sciences Mathematiques, 28, 517–522]. The proofs of the second and third conditions are established by showing the equivalence between these three conditions. The results are re-stated in the infinite dimensional geometric approach of [Fliess, M., Lévine J., Martin, P., Rouchon, P. (1999). A Lie–Bäcklund approach to equivalence and flatness of nonlinear systems. IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 44(5), 922–937].","authors":["PAULO SERGIO Pereira da Silva"],"meta":["December 2008Automatica 44(12):3219-3221","DOI:10.1016/j.automatica.2008.10.001","SourceDBLP"],"references":["265955769_Relative_Flatness_and_Flatness_of_Implicit_Systems","316912270_On_time-invariant_systems_possessing_time-dependent_flat_outputs","292763992_On_decompositions_for_noncontrollable_nonlinear_systems","288352261_Design_for_multi-input_nonlinear_systems_in_Differential_Geometric_Control_Theory_Progress_in_Mathematics_vol_27_R_W_Brockett","267014265_On_Linearization_of_Control_Systems","266043104_Dynamic_feedback_for_classical_geometries","265459137_Geometrical_Aspects_of_Partial_Differential_Equations","248156882_Treatise_on_Analysis_Volume_1","244423475_Design_for_multi-input_nonlinear_systems","243093058_Sufficient_Conditions_for_Dynamic_State_Feedback_Linearization"]}
