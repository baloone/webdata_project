In this paper, we present three labeled\nhandwritten digit datasets, collectively called n-MNIST. Then, we propose a\nnovel framework for the classification of handwritten digits that learns sparse\nrepresentations using probabilistic quadtrees and Deep Belief Nets. On the\nMNIST and n-MNIST datasets, our framework shows promising results and\nsignificantly outperforms traditional Deep Belief Networks.","authors":["Saikat Basu","Manohar Karki","Sangram Ganguly","Robert Dibiano"],"meta":["June 2017Neural Processing Letters 45(3)","DOI:10.1007/s11063-016-9556-4","SourcearXiv"],"references":["311491838_DeepSat_a_learning_framework_for_satellite_imagery","228102719_Improving_neural_networks_by_preventing_co-adaptation_of_feature_detectors","224216007_Acoustic_Modeling_Using_Deep_Belief_Networks","221620168_Efficient_sparse_coding_algorithms","221344904_Convolutional_deep_belief_networks_for_scalable_unsupervised_learning_of_hierarchical_representations","311469666_Sparse_feature_learning_for_deep_belief_networks","309773141_A_theoretical_analysis_of_Deep_Neural_Networks_for_texture_classification","300293839_Dirac_Delta_Function","286794765_Dropout_A_Simple_Way_to_Prevent_Neural_Networks_from_Overfitting","233946451_Dirac_Delta_Function"]}
