The paper\ndiscusses the concept of Information retrieval, the various information\nretrieval methods. It examines the users of these information methods and\ntheir information behavior. The conclusion emphasizes the need for a\ncontinuous evaluation of the information retrieval methods to make for and\neffective and efficient information retrieval system","authors":["Dr Edeama Onwuchekwa","OR Jegede"],"meta":["November 2011African Research Review 5(6)","DOI:10.4314/afrrev.v5i6.10"],"references":["246471766_Information_needs_and_uses_Fifty_years_of_progress","329931718_The_Intellectual_Foundation_of_Information_Organization","297481555_Abstracts_produced_using_computer_assistance","282297402_An_experiment_in_the_use_of_tools_for_computer-assisted_abstracting","263254006_Sorting_Out_The_Web_Approaches_to_Subject_Access","262167209_Online_library_catalogues_as_information_retrieval_systems_what_can_we_learn_from_research","242509165_Information_retrieval_systems_Theory_and_implementation","234806432_Automated_information_retrieval_Theory_and_methods","234621529_A_Computer-Aided_Abstracting_Tool_Kit","233651802_Information_storage_and_retrieval_by_stopping_pulses_of_light"]}
