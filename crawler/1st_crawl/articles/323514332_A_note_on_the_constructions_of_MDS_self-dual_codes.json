{"id":"323514332_A_note_on_the_constructions_of_MDS_self-dual_codes","abstract":"Due to the nice structures of maximum distance separable (MDS) codes and self-dual codes, it is worth studying MDS self-dual codes. It is easy to see that parameters of a MDS self-dual code are completely determined by the code length. The main problem in this topic is to determine existence of q-ary MDS self-dual codes of various lengths. The problem is completely solved when q is even. This paper focuses on the case that q is odd. We generalize the technique in [13] and construct several classes of MDS self-dual codes via generalized Reed-Solomon codes and extended generalized Reed-Solomon codes.","authors":["Haode Yan"],"meta":["March 2019Cryptography and Communications 11(1-2):1-10","DOI:10.1007/s12095-018-0288-3"],"references":["268895288_On_the_1056_9_Reed-Solomon_and_Glynn_codes","268689393_On_the_Classification_of_MDS_Codes","259764579_On_the_Existence_of_MDS_Codes_Over_Small_Fields_With_Constrained_Generator_Matrices","251375604_New_MDS_self-dual_codes_over_finite_fields","234689322_Balanced_Sparsest_Generator_Matrices_for_MDS_Codes","291229449_New_MDS_Self-Dual_Codes_from_Generalized_Reed-Solomon_Codes","268491888_Orthogonal_designs_and_MDS_self-dual_codes","257481663_MDS_Self-Dual_Codes_over_Large_Prime_Fields","242371333_The_Theory_of_Error_Correcting_Codes","224324944_On_self-dual_MDS_codes","4353212_Secret-sharing_schemes_based_on_self-dual_codes","3087035_New_MDS_or_near-MDS_self-dual_codes","222778214_Euclidean_and_Hermitian_self-dual_MDS_codes_over_large_finite_fields","220189032_On_self-dual_codes_over_some_prime_fields","27287267_The_theory_of_error_correcting_codes"]}
