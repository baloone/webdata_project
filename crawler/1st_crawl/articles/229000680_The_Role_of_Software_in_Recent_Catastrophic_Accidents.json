{"id":"229000680_The_Role_of_Software_in_Recent_Catastrophic_Accidents","abstract":"Software is increasingly used to monitor and control safety-critical devices and processes, in areas such as medicine, transportation, nuclear power generation, aeronautics, etc. Consequently however, an error in the software, or an error in its use, can have devastating effects that are not just financial, but can often also lead to the loss of life. In this article we review 15 recent catastrophic accidents and identify the roles that were played by software in causing them, as well as the useful lessons that can be learned from them.","authors":["W Eric Wong","Vidroha Debroy","Andrew Restrepo"],"meta":["January 2009"],"references":["6600829_Overexposure_of_radiation_therapy_patients_in_Panama_Problem_recognition_and_follow-up_measures","280939933_Report_on_the_Loss_of_the_Mars_Polar_Lander_and_Deep_Space_2_Missions","265278987_Cyber_Incident_Blamed_for_Nuclear_Power_Plant_Shutdown","224753535_Lost_Radio_Contact_Leaves_Pilots_on_Their_Own","3922846_An_analysis_of_causation_in_aerospace_accidents"]}
