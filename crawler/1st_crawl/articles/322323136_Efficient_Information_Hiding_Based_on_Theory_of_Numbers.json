{"id":"322323136_Efficient_Information_Hiding_Based_on_Theory_of_Numbers","abstract":"Data hiding is an efficient technique that conceals secret data into a digital medium. In 2006, Zhang and Wang proposed a data hiding scheme called exploiting modification direction (EMD) which has become a milestone in the field of data hiding. In recent years, many EMD-type data hiding schemes have been developed, but their embedding capacity remains restricted. In this paper, a novel data hiding scheme based on the combination of Chinese remainder theorem (CRT) and a new extraction function is proposed. By the proposed scheme, the cover image is divided into non-overlapping pixel groups for embedding to increase the embedding capacity. Experimental results show that the embedding capacity of the proposed scheme is significantly higher (greater than 2.5 bpp) than previously proposed schemes while ensuring very good visual quality of the stego image. In addition, security analysis is given to show that the proposed scheme can resist visual attack.","authors":["Yanjun Liu","Chin-Chen Chang","Peng-Cheng Huang","Cheng-Yi Hsu"],"meta":["January 2018Symmetry 10(1):19","DOI:10.3390/sym10010019"],"references":["326998029_A_Steganographic_Scheme_by_Fully_Exploiting_Modification_Directions","313694441_Improved_detection_of_LSB_steganography_in_grayscale_images","312888624_Efficient_steganographic_embedding_by_exploiting_modification_direction","286725669_A_Novel_Turtle_Shell_Based_Scheme_for_Data_Hiding","283828302_High_capacity_turtle_shell-based_data_hiding","282967705_Signed_digit_data_hiding_scheme","282598400_Binary_Power_Data_Hiding_Scheme","277900030_Lossless_and_Reversible_Data_Hiding_in_Encrypted_Images_With_Public-Key_Cryptography","276067210_High_Capacity_Reversible_Data_Hiding_in_Encrypted_Images_by_Patch-Level_Sparse_Representation","274738122_Reversible_Data_Hiding_in_Encrypted_Images_With_Distributed_Source_Encoding"]}
