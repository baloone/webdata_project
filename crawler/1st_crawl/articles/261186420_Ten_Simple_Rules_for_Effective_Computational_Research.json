{"id":"261186420_Ten_Simple_Rules_for_Effective_Computational_Research","abstract":"In this paper we offer a jargon-free guide to best practice when developing and using software for scientific research. While many guides to software development exist, they are often aimed at computer scientists or concentrate on large open-source projects. The present guide is aimed specifically at the vast majority of scientific researchers: those without formal training in computer science. We present our ten simple rules with the aim of enabling scientists to be more effective in undertaking research and therefore maximise the impact of this research within the scientific community. While these rules are described individually, collectively they form a single vision for how to approach the practical side of computational science.","authors":["James M Osborne","Miguel O Bernabeu","Maria Bruna","Ben Calderhead"],"meta":["March 2014PLoS Computational Biology 10(3):e1003506","DOI:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003506","SourcePubMed"],"references":["259743867_Impact_of_blood_rheology_on_wall_shear_stress_in_a_model_of_the_middle_cerebral_artery","236068415_Chaste_An_Open_Source_C_Library_for_Computational_Physiology_and_Biology","233870994_Ten_Simple_Rules_for_the_Open_Development_of_Scientific_Software","51760913_Ten_Simple_Rules_for_Getting_Involved_in_Your_Scientific_Community","51737572_A_Peptide_Filtering_Relation_Quantifies_MHC_Class_I_Peptide_Optimization","51699945_Ten_Simple_Rules_for_Getting_Help_from_Online_Scientific_Communities","24356023_Ten_Simple_Rules_To_Combine_Teaching_and_Research","7656563_PLoS_Computational_Biology_A_New_Community_Journal","257074228_Mozilla_plan_seeks_to_debug_scientific_code","229434194_A_Whole-Cell_Computational_Model_Predicts_Phenotype_from_Genotype"]}
