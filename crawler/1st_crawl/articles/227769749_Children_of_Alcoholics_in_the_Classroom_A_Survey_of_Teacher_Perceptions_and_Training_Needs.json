{"id":"227769749_Children_of_Alcoholics_in_the_Classroom_A_Survey_of_Teacher_Perceptions_and_Training_Needs","abstract":"Children of alcoholics (COAs) represent a population at risk for alcoholism as well as other physical, emotional, and social problems. This survey explored perceptions of North Carolina elementary and middle school teachers regarding roles and responsibilities in assisting COAs, their need for additional training specific to COAs, and their perceptions of school-based resources for helping COAs. Survey findings suggest teachers generally are willing to assist COAs but need training regarding these children. Training is particularly appropriate for teachers who perceive a low incidence of COAs in their classrooms since these individuals' responses suggest the existence of barriers to effective COA assistance.","authors":["Karen Vail-Smith","Anne Marie Barnes Consultant","Sharon Maureen Knight","Karen Vail‚ÄêSmith"],"meta":["October 1992Journal of School Health 62(8):367 - 371","DOI:10.1111/j.1746-1561.1992.tb02325.x"],"references":["258829967_Development_of_a_school-based_prevention_program_for_children_in_alcoholic_families","229025551_Helping_children_cope_with_stress","19747967_Risk_status_of_adolescent_children_of_problem-drinking_parents","286004318_Children_of_alcoholics_Children_in_need","276622253_Evaluating_and_Treating_Adult_Children_of_Alcoholics_Vol_2_Treatment","232519997_Children_of_Alcoholics_School_Intervention","232517704_Is_Alcoholism_Hereditary","232481237_Children_of_alcoholic_parents_Inherited_and_psycho-social_influences","232469898_Identification_of_Children_of_Alcoholics_Two_Empirical_Studies","232466740_Alcoholism_and_the_family_A_survey_of_the_literature","227822685_Children_of_Alcoholic_Parents_A_Neglected_Issue","20385852_Adult_children_of_alcoholics","20093810_Research_on_Children_of_Alcoholics_past_and_future","15325131_Children_from_alcoholic_families-A_population_at_risk","8025873_Children_of_Alcoholics_Foundation"]}
