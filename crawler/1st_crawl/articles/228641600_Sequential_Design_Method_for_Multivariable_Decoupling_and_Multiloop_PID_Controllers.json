{"id":"228641600_Sequential_Design_Method_for_Multivariable_Decoupling_and_Multiloop_PID_Controllers","abstract":"Underlying algorithms for designing multivariable decoupling and multiloop PI/PID controllers in a sequential fashion are addressed. A single-loop technique, composed of biased relay identification schemes and tuning formulae leading to the minimum weighted integral of square error, is developed to tune each loop in the predetermined sequence of loop closing. The proposed tuning technique is appropriate for a wide range of process dynamics in a multivariable environment. A method is then proposed to design decouplers to compensate for the effect of interactions and tune the resultant weakly interacting, single-loop PI/PID controllers sequen-tially. The decouplers, together with the single-loop controllers, constitute the multivariable decoupling controller. If the interactions are not significant, multiloop PI/PID controllers, which do not incorporate decouplers, could be employed. Simulation and comparative results are shown for one 2 × 2 and one 3 × 3 multivariable system from the literature. Despite its simplicity, the proposed design method yields superior multivariable designs on the basis of performance, robust stability, and integrity.","authors":["Shing-Jia Shiu","Shyh-Hong Hwang"],"meta":["January 1998Industrial & Engineering Chemistry Research 37(1)","DOI:10.1021/ie970352n"],"references":["316800606_Digital_Control_Systems","316691158_Digital_Control_Systems","279933376_A_Method_for_Closed_Loop_Automatic_Tuning_of_PID_Controllers","266538852_Interaction_Analysis-Principles_and_Applications","256123491_A_Heuristic_Approach_to_the_Design_of_Linear_Multivariable_Control_System","243768415_Closed_Loop_Properties_from_Steady-State_Gain_Information","243765326_Internal_Model_Control_1_A_Unifying_Review_and_Some_New_Results","243762168_Terminal_Composition_Control_of_Binary_Distillation_Column","233435349_Tuning_Method_for_Interactive_Multiloop_Imc_Pi_And_Pid_Controllers","232909575_Multivariable_Control_by_Individual_Channel_Design","231367348_Closed-Loop_Automatic_Tuning_of_Single-Input-Single-Output_Systems","231367055_Geometric_Interpretation_and_Measures_of_Dynamic_Interactions_in_Multivariable_Control_Systems","231366090_Autotuning_of_Multiloop_Proportional-Integral_Controller_Using_Relay_Feedback","231294954_Simple_Method_for_Tuning_SISO_Controllers_in_Multivariable_Systems","231294895_Internal_model_control_4_PID_controller_design","230887814_Process_control_systems_application_design_and_tuning","230872880_Internal_Model_Control_1_A_unifying_review_and_some_new_results","229763219_Multivariable_Controller_Design_for_Linear_Systems_Having_Multiple_Time_Delays","227661839_Use_of_Relay-Feedback_Test_for_Auto-matic_Tuning_of_Multivariable_Systems","223357948_A_Methodology_for_Sequential_Design_of_Robust_Decentralized_Control_Systems","222735820_Automatic_Tuning_of_Simple_Regulators_With_Specifications_on_Phase_and_Amplitude_Margins","222369761_A_Method_for_Auto-Tuning_of_PID_Control_parameters","220045522_Optimum_Setting_for_Automatic_Controllers","3028973_Multivariable_feedback_design_Concepts_for_a_classicalmodern_synthesis","3028970_Principal_Gains_and_Principal_Phases_in_the_Analysis_of_Linear_Multivariable_Feedback_Systems"]}
