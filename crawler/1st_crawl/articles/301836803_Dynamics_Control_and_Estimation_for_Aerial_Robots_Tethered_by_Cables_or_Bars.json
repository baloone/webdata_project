{"id":"301836803_Dynamics_Control_and_Estimation_for_Aerial_Robots_Tethered_by_Cables_or_Bars","abstract":"The problem of controlling an aerial robot connected by a passive tether or a passive rigid link to the ground is considered here. We provide a thorough characterization of this nonlinear dynamical robotic system in terms of fundamental properties such as differential flatness, controllability, and observability. We prove that the robotic system is differentially flat with respect to two possible output pairs: elevation of the link and attitude of the vehicle; elevation of the link and longitudinal stress force applied to the link (e.g., cable tension, or bar compression). We show the design of an almost globally convergent nonlinear observer of the full state that resorts only to onboard IMU measurements, namely an accelerometer and a gyroscope. We also design two almost globally convergent nonlinear controllers for the two flat output pairs. Using this controller the system is able to track any sufficiently smooth time-varying trajectory of the outputs as, e.g., to maintain the link stress within the operating conditions while maneuvering the elevation. The combination of robot dynamics, observer and controller is analytically proven to result in a stable closed-loop system. Finally, using extensive dynamical simulations, we test the robustness of the proposed method in several far-from-nominal conditions: nonlinear cross-coupling effects, parameter deviations, and noise in the measurements.","authors":["Marco Tognon","Antonio Franchi"],"meta":["March 2016IEEE Transactions on Robotics PP(99)","DOI:10.1109/TRO.2017.2677915"],"references":["314584837_Dynamics_Control_and_Planning_for_Cooperative_Manipulation_of_Payloads_Suspended_by_Cables_from_Multiple_Quadrotor_Robots","310829525_Motion_Planning_for_6-D_Manipulation_with_Aerial_Towed-cable_Systems","283131510_Nonlinear_observer-based_tracking_control_of_link_stress_and_elevation_for_a_tethered_aerial_robot_using_inertial-only_measurements","281159481_Extended_Simulations_for_the_Link_Stress_and_Elevation_Control_of_a_Tethered_Aerial_Robot","262282922_Advances_in_Modeling_and_Control_of_Tethered_Unmanned_Helicopters_to_Enhance_Hovering_Performance","260698012_Aerial_Robotics_and_the_Quadrotor_From_the_Guest_Editors","259741166_Actuator_Constrained_Trajectory_Generation_and_Control_for_Variable-Pitch_Quadrotors","233863157_Modeling_and_Control_of_UAV_Bearing-Formations_with_Bilateral_High-Level_Steering","230872857_Flatness_and_defect_of_non-linear_systems_introductory_theory_and_examples","228107408_A_flexible_unmanned_aerial_vehicle_for_precision_agriculture","224252898_Design_and_Flight_Testing_of_an_Autonomous_Variable-Pitch_Quadrotor","220122125_Trajectory_Planning_and_Control_for_Planar_Robots_with_Passive_Last_Joint","3450312_Approaches_for_a_tether-guided_landing_of_an_autonomous_helicopter","325369967_Robotics_Modelling_planning_and_control","308792527_Takeoff_and_Landing_on_Slopes_via_Inclined_Hovering_with_a_Tethered_Aerial_Robot","292346154_Observer-Based_Control_of_Position_and_Tension_for_an_Aerial_Robot_Tethered_to_a_Moving_Platform","286909079_Taut_cable_control_of_a_tethered_UAV","286810655_Tethered_aerial_robots_using_contactless_power_systems_for_extended_mission_time_and_range","281050359_Turning_a_Near-hovering_Controlled_Quadrotor_into_a_3D_Force_Effector","270914631_Aerial_manipulation_robot_composed_of_an_autonomous_helicopter_and_a_7_degrees_of_freedom_industrial_manipulator","261352991_Stabilization_of_a_flying_vehicle_on_a_taut_tether_using_inertial_sensing","261247233_Cooperative_pose_stabilization_of_an_aerial_vehicle_through_physical_interaction_with_a_team_of_ground_robots","260145899_Robotics_Modelling_Planning_and_Control","251508887_Umbilical_deployment_modeling_for_tethered_UAV_detecting_oil_pollution_from_ship","233863156_Bilateral_Teleoperation_of_Groups_of_Mobile_Robots_With_Time-Varying_Topology","228108311_Nonlinear_Control_Systems_II","225521797_Multi-UAV_Cooperation_and_Control_for_Load_Transportation_and_Deployment","222650992_High-gain_observers_in_the_presence_of_measurement_noise_A_switched-gain_approach","3673438_Unmanned_aerial_vehicle_UAV_communications_relay"]}
