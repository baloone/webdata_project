{"id":"282181468_Exploration_and_Exploitation_of_Victorian_Science_in_Darwin's_Reading_Notebooks","abstract":"Search in an environment with an uncertain distribution of resources involves\na trade-off between local exploitation and distant exploration. This extends to\nthe problem of information foraging, where a knowledge-seeker shifts between\nreading in depth and studying new domains. To study this, we examine the\nreading choices made by one of the most celebrated scientists of the modern\nera: Charles Darwin. Darwin built his theory of natural selection in part by\nsynthesizing disparate parts of Victorian science. When we analyze his\nextensively self-documented reading we find shifts, on multiple timescales,\nbetween choosing to remain with familiar topics and seeking cognitive surprise\nin novel fields. On the longest timescales, these shifts correlate with major\nintellectual epochs of his career, as detected by Bayesian epoch estimation.\nWhen we compare Darwin's reading path with publication order of the same texts,\nwe find Darwin more adventurous than the culture as a whole.","authors":["Jaimie Murdock","Colin Allen","Simon DeDeo"],"meta":["September 2015Cognition 159","DOI:10.1016/j.cognition.2016.11.012","SourcearXiv","Project: Darwin's Semantic Voyage"],"references":["316442066_Bandit_Processes_and_Dynamic_Allocation_Indices_with_discussion","310022131_Visualization_Techniques_for_Topic_Model_Checking","282727134_Anomalous_subgraph_detection_in_publication_networks_Leveraging_truth","279299781_Recent_evolution_of_learnability_in_American_English_from_1800_to_2000","274403249_Formation_of_Scientific_Fields_as_a_Universal_Topological_Transition","269467302_Exploration_versus_exploitation_in_space_mind_and_society","264550234_The_dynamics_of_correlated_novelties","263518374_The_civilizing_process_in_London's_Old_Bailey","263048857_Invention_as_a_Combinatorial_Process_Evidence_from_US_Patents","261801013_The_Exploration-Exploitation_Dilemma_A_Multidisciplinary_Framework","234143280_Social_Dynamics_of_Science","229101074_Information_Foraging","330436605_The_Three_Tasks_of_Epistemology_A_Guide_and_Reader","329653912_Discovering_Complexity_Decomposition_and_Localization_as_Strategies_in_Scientific_Research","326070613_Navigating_the_local_modes_of_big_data_The_case_of_topic_models","319088426_Units_and_Levels_of_Selection","311533419_Designing_organizations_for_an_information-rich_world","311532789_Latent_dirichlet_allocation","304049855_Selection_and_Information_A_Class-Based_Approach_to_Lexical_Relationships","303101292_Bandit_processes_and_dynamic_allocation_indices_J_Roy_Stat_Soc_B","292457164_The_life_and_letters_of_Charles_Darwin_Including_an_autobiographical_chapter","289815105_Charles_Darwin_The_Concise_story_of_an_extraordinary_man","285529367_The_Quiet_Transformations_of_Literary_Studies_What_Thirteen_Thousand_Scholars_Could_Tell_Us","281549729_Topic_modeling_and_digital_humanities","274811593_Darwin_on_Man_A_Psychological_Study_of_Scientific_Creativity","274743960_A_Narrative_inquiry_on_School_Sports_Club_Activity_of_Underachieved_a_Male_Middle_School_student","272161307_Reinforcement_Learning_An_Introduction","269719671_Analyzing_the_history_of_Cognition_using_Topic_Models","269660146_Citation_Indexing-Its_Theory_and_Application_in_Science_Technology_and_Humanities","265689798_Learning_General_Phonological_Rules_From_Distributional_Information_A_Computational_Model","262530678_Spaces_of_the_possible_Universal_Darwinism_and_the_wall_between_technological_and_biological_innovation","262175901_Probabilistic_Topic_Models","262157385_Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation","259125817_Introduction-Topic_Models_What_They_Are_and_Why_They_Matter","255979813_Macroanalysis_Digital_Methods_and_Literary_History","248701790_Introduction_to_Probabilistic_Topic_Models","243764129_Discovering_Complexity_Decomposition_and_Localization_as_Strategies_in_Scientific_Research","242494458_Scientific_Discovery_Computational_Explorations_of_the_Creative_Process","238673233_Human_problem_solving_The_state_of_the_theory_in_1970","230869442_Learning_Phonemes_With_a_Proto-Lexicon","228314120_March_JG_Exploration_and_exploitation_in_organizational_learning_Organ_Sci_2_71-87","227992567_Elements_of_Information_Theory","227872509_Exploration_Exploitation_and_Financial_Performance_Analysis_of_SP_500_Corporations","227517907_Eliassen_S_Jorgensen_C_Mangel_M_Giske_J_Exploration_or_exploitation_life_expectancy_changes_the_value_of_learning_in_foraging_strategies_Oikos_116_513-523","226700516_Scientific_discovery_as_problem_solving","224943903_Multilingual_Topic_Models_for_Unaligned_Text","224871400_Quantitative_Patterns_of_Stylistic_Influence_in_the_Evolution_of_Literature","224773133_Elements_of_information_theory_2nd_ed","223034771_Computational_support_of_scientific_discovery","222425165_Exploitation_vs_exploration_Choosing_a_supplier_in_an_environment_of_incomplete_information","221013275_Studying_the_History_of_Ideas_Using_Topic_Models","220691633_Natural_Language_Processing_with_Python","51378909_Should_I_stay_or_should_I_go_How_the_human_brain_manages_the_trade-off_between_exploitation_and_exploration_Proceedings_paper","221405139_Multilingual_Topic_Models_for_Unaligned_Text","220480207_Statistical_models_for_the_induction_and_use_of_selectional_preferences"]}
