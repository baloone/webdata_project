{"id":"260476235_Polynomial_controller_design_based_on_flatness","abstract":"By the use of flatness the problem of pole placement, which consists in imposing closed loop system dynamics can be related to tracking. Polynomial controllers for finite-dimensional linear systems can then be designed with very natural choices for high level parameters design. This design leads to a Bezout equation which is independent of the closed loop dynamics but depends only on the system model.","authors":["Frédéric Rotella","F.J.
