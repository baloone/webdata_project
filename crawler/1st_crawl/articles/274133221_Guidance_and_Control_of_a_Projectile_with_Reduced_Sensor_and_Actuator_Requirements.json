{"id":"274133221_Guidance_and_Control_of_a_Projectile_with_Reduced_Sensor_and_Actuator_Requirements","abstract":"Successfully guiding a projectile launched from a gun is an extremely challenging task. Striking a balance between performance and affordability requires innovative solutions. This paper introduces a unique guidance and control strategy that enables precision and trajectory shaping with reduced Sensor and actuator needs. The derivation of this guidance and control algorithm is based on flight dynamics. Flight experiments were conducted to verify that the algorithm guided the projectile to the target and to demonstrate its application to different airframes. Features of the algorithm (such as expected precision, maneuver conservation, and trajectory shaping) were investigated through modeling and simulation. Position bias errors drove the precision; errors due to the guidance and control algorithm were on the order of 0.1 m. An analysis was conducted on the lateral acceleration available from the airframe, lateral acceleration required for this algorithm, and lateral acceleration required for classic proportional navigation. For control-authority-limited munitions proportional navigation was unable to intercept the target point, whereas the current guidance algorithm successfully hit the target. Trajectory shaping with this algorithm is demonstrated through simulation.","authors":["Frank Fresconi"],"meta":["November 2011Journal of Guidance, Control, and Dynamics 34(6):1757-1766","DOI:10.2514/1.53584"],"references":["281477365_Excalibur_New_precision_engagement_asset_in_the_warfight","268557158_Aerodynamic_Characterizations_of_Asymmetric_and_Maneuvering_105mm_120mm_and_155mm_Fin-Stabilized_Projectiles_Derived_from_Telemetry_Experiments","245438153_Dispersion_Reduction_of_a_Direct_Fire_Rocket_Using_Lateral_Pulse_Jets","245433932_Design_of_a_Roll-Stabilized_Mortar_Projectile_with_Reciprocating_Canards","245392882_Control_Mechanism_Strategies_for_Spin-Stabilized_Projectiles","245373444_Performance_of_a_Smart_Direct_Fire_Projectile_Using_a_Ram_Air_Control_Mechanism","245372887_Model_Predictive_Control_of_a_Direct_Fire_Projectile_Equipped_With_Canards","245307660_Practical_Assessment_of_Real-Time_Impact_Point_Estimators_for_Smart_Weapons","245274263_An_Adaptive_Autopilot_Design_for_Guided_Munitions","239415680_Guidance_and_Control_of_a_Cannon-Launched_Guided_Projectile","239415012_Model_Predictive_Lateral_Pulse_Jet_Control_of_an_Atmospheric_Rocket","238189329_Guidance_Algorithm_for_Range_Maximization_and_Time-of-Flight_Control_of_a_Guided_Projectile","238189305_Predictive_Control_of_a_Munition_Using_Low-Speed_Linear_Theory","238093822_Simplified_Projectile_Swerve_Solution_for_General_Control_Inputs","235070115_Addressing_the_Challenges_of_a_Thruster-Based_Precision_Guided_Mortar_Munition_With_the_Use_of_Embedded_Telemetry_Instrumentation","224401764_Predictive_Guidance_of_a_Projectile_for_Hit-to-Kill_Interception"]}
