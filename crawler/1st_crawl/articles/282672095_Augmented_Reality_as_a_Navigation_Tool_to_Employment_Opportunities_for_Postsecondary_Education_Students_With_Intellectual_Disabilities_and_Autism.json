{"id":"282672095_Augmented_Reality_as_a_Navigation_Tool_to_Employment_Opportunities_for_Postsecondary_Education_Students_With_Intellectual_Disabilities_and_Autism","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of location-based augmented reality navigation compared to Google Maps and paper maps as navigation aids for students with disabilities. The participants in this single subject study were three college students with intellectual disability and one college student with autism spectrum disorder. The study measured their ability to independently make navigation decisions in order to travel to unknown business locations in a city. All students attended a postsecondary education college-based program. Results indicated that students traveled more successfully using augmented reality compared to Google Maps and a paper map. Conclusions are discussed in the context of reducing barriers related to employment.
