{"id":"309814858_On_j-near_concepts_in_rough_sets_with_some_applications","abstract":"The main purpose of the present paper is to introduce the new concepts \"j-near concepts\" in rough set context to be used as mathematical tools, approximating the rough sets and removing the vagueness (uncertainty) of rough sets. The basic notions of j-near approximations are sufficiently illustrated. Comparisons among the accuracy of these types of approximations are superimposed. We further investigate some practical examples to illustrate the importance of the suggested structures. Finally, several examples are given to indicate counter connections.","authors":["W.s.
