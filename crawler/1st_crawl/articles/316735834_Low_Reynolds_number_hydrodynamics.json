{"id":"316735834_Low_Reynolds_number_hydrodynamics","abstract":"Low Reynolds number flow theory finds wide application in such diverse fields as sedimentation, fluidization, particle-size classification, dust and mist collection, filtration, centrifugation, polymer and suspension rheology, flow through porous media, colloid science, aerosol and hydrosal technology, lubrication theory, blood flow, Brownian motion, geophysics, meteorology, and a host of other disciplines. This text provides a comprehensive and detailed account of the physical and mathematical principles underlying such phenomena, heretofore available only in the original literature.","authors":["John Happel","Howard Brenner"],"meta":["January 1981","DOI:10.1007/978-94-009-8352-6","ISBN: 978-90-247-2877-0"],"references":[]}
