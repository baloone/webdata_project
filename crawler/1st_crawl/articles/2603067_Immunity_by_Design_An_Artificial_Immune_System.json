{"id":"2603067_Immunity_by_Design_An_Artificial_Immune_System","abstract":"We describe an artificial immune system (AIS) that is distributed, robust, dynamic, diverse and adaptive. It captures many features of the vertebrate immune system and places them in the context of the problem of protecting a network of computers from illegal intrusions.","authors":["Steven Hofmeyr","Stephanie Forrest"],"meta":["April 2001"],"references":["262389477_An_immunological_approach_to_change_detection_algorithms_analysis_and_implications","3633815_A_Sense_of_Self_for_Unix_Process","285481525_The_immune_system_in_health_and_disease","281721679_Towards_a_network_theory_of_the_immune_system","246088528_Immunobiology_The_immune_system_in_health_and_disease","243769501_Catching_Ourselves_in_the_Act","243747425_Predicting_the_size_of_the_antibody_combining_region_from_consideration_of_efficient_selfnon-self_discrimination","239047375_ImmunoBiology_The_Immune_System_in_Health_and_Diseases","19022316_Towards_a_network_theory_of_the_immune_system_Ann_Inst_Pasteur_Immunol_125C373-389","13812921_The_Brain_Has_a_Body_Adaptive_Behavior_Emerges_from_Interactions_of_Nervous_System_Body_and_Environment"]}
