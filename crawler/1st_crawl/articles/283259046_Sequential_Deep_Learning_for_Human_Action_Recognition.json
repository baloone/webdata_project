{"id":"283259046_Sequential_Deep_Learning_for_Human_Action_Recognition","abstract":"We propose in this paper a fully automated deep model, which learns to classify human actions without using any prior knowledge. The first step of our scheme, based on the extension of Convolutional Neural Networks to 3D, automatically learns spatio-temporal features. A Recurrent Neural Network is then trained to classify each sequence considering the temporal evolution of the learned features for each timestep. Experimental results on the KTH dataset show that the proposed approach outperforms existing deep models, and gives comparable results with the best related works.","authors":["Moez Baccouche","Franck Mamalet","Christian Wolf","Christophe Garcia"],"meta":["November 2011","Conference: Human Behaviour UnderstandingAt: AmsterdamVolume: LNCS 7065"],"references":["224579268_Recognizing_realistic_actions_from_videos_in_the_Wild","224375206_Human_action_recognition_with_line_and_flow_histograms","221376179_Convolutional_Networks_and_Applications_in_Vision","221364856_R_Tensor_Canonical_Correlation_Analysis_for_Action_Classification","221362695_Action_MACH_a_spatio-temporal_Maximum_Average_Correlation_Height_filter_for_action_recognition","221362367_Learning_human_actions_via_information_maximization","221361480_Action_Snippets_How_many_frames_does_human_action_recognition_require","221110709_A_Biologically_Inspired_System_for_Action_Recognition","220659676_Unsupervised_Learning_of_Human_Action_Categories_Using_Spatial-Temporal_Words","220320057_Learning_Precise_Timing_with_LSTM_Recurrent_Networks","216792694_Convolutional_Learning_of_Spatio-temporal_Features","4090526_Recognizing_human_actions_A_local_SVM_approach","3328006_Toward_automatic_phenotyping_of_developing_embryos_from_videos","3193801_Convolutional_face_finder_A_neural_architecture_for_fast_and_robust_face_detection","2985446_Gradient-Based_Learning_Applied_to_Document_Recognition","255598362_MoSIFT_Recognizing_Human_Actions_in_Surveillance_Videos","232652386_Action_recognition_via_local_descriptors_and_holistic_features_PDF","225153976_Human_Action_Recognition_Using_a_Modified_Convolutional_Neural_Network","225117974_Comparing_Evaluation_Protocols_on_the_KTH_Dataset","224136049_Spatio-Temporal_Relationship_Match_Video_Structure_Comparison_for_Recognition_of_Complex_Human_Activities","221361842_Learning_Realistic_Human_Actions_from_Movies","221346417_3D_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_Human_Action_Recognition","221259353_Evaluation_of_Local_Spatio-temporal_Features_for_Action_Recognition","221078505_Action_Classification_in_Soccer_Videos_with_Long_Short-Term_Memory_Recurrent_Neural_Networks","216792705_What_is_the_Best_Multi-Stage_Architecture_for_Object_Recognition","4210181_Behavior_recognition_via_sparse_spatio-temporal_features"]}
