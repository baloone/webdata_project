{"id":"273458545_Implementation_and_integration_of_engineering_in_K-12_STEM_education","abstract":"Engineering is the bond in STEM integration in K–12 education. In this chapter , we present an overview of the literature on engineering in K–12 STEM integration, as well as a framework for the development and assessment of integrated STEM activities. The usefulness of the framework is demonstrated through application to three research-based STEM integration curricula. Finally, benefits and barriers for STEM integration in the classroom are presented and discussed.","authors":["Tamara J.
