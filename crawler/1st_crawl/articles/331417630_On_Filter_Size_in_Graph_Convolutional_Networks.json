{"id":"331417630_On_Filter_Size_in_Graph_Convolutional_Networks","abstract":"Recently, many researchers have been focusing on the definition of neural networks for graphs. The basic component for many of these approaches remains the graph convolution idea proposed almost a decade ago. In this paper, we extend this basic component, following an intuition derived from the well-known convolutional filters over multi-dimensional tensors. In particular, we derive a simple, efficient and effective way to introduce a hyper-parameter on graph convolutions that influences the filter size, i.e., its receptive field over the considered graph. We show with experimental results on real-world graph datasets that the proposed graph convolutional filter improves the predictive performance of Deep Graph Convolutional Networks.","authors":["Van Dinh Tran","Nicol√≤ Navarin","Alessandro Sperduti"],"meta":["November 2018","DOI:10.1109/SSCI.2018.8628758","Conference: 2018 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (SSCI)"],"references":["319896834_Representation_Learning_on_Graphs_Methods_and_Applications","305196650_Going_deeper_with_convolutions","301876854_Bridging_the_Gaps_Between_Residual_Learning_Recurrent_Neural_Networks_and_Visual_Cortex","291576637_Efficient_Graph_Kernels_by_Randomization","282402903_Convolutional_Networks_on_Graphs_for_Learning_Molecular_Fingerprints","280062092_Ordered_Decompositional_DAG_Kernels_Enhancements","228953502_Acyclic_Subgraph_based_Descriptor_Spaces_for_Chemical_Compound_Retrieval_and_Classification","221345691_Fast_Neighborhood_Subgraph_Pairwise_Distance_Kernel","47843134_Efficient_Graphlet_Kernels_for_Large_Graph_Comparison","38027257_Learning_Nonsparse_Kernels_by_Self-Organizing_Maps_for_Structured_Data","10683743_Statistical_Evaluation_of_the_Predictive_Toxicology_Challenge_2000-2001","323410880_N-GCN_Multi-scale_Graph_Convolution_for_Semi-supervised_Node_Classification","322514017_Generative_Kernels_for_Tree-Structured_Data","320968288_Dynamic_Edge-Conditioned_Filters_in_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_on_Graphs","319770105_Diffusion-Convolutional_Neural_Networks","315881954_Dynamic_Edge-Conditioned_Filters_in_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_on_Graphs","307991731_Semi-Supervised_Classification_with_Graph_Convolutional_Networks","303302244_Learning_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_Graphs","284219592_Gated_Graph_Sequence_Neural_Networks","244448733_Structure-Activity_Relationship_of_Mutagenic_Aromatic_and_Heteroaromatic_Nitro_Compounds_Correlation_with_Molecular_Orbital_Energies_and_Hydrophobicity","228929800_Weisfeiler-Lehman_Graph_Kernels","224380082_Neural_Network_for_Graphs_A_Contextual_Constructive_Approach","221345160_Learning_Discriminative_Fisher_Kernels","23643768_The_Graph_Neural_Network_Model","10671348_Distinguishing_Enzyme_Structures_from_Non-enzymes_Without_Alignments","5595870_Supervised_neural_networks_for_the_classification_of_structures","4207736_Shortest-Path_Kernels_on_Graphs"]}
