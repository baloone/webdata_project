{"id":"286679659_Dynamics_and_control_of_quadrotor_with_robotic_manipulator","abstract":"We show That The Lagrange dynamics of quadrotor-manipulator systems can be completely decoupled into: 1) The center-of-mass dynamics in E(3), which, similar To The standard quadrotor dynamics, is point-mass dynamics with under-Actuation and gravity effect; and 2) The 'internal rotational' dynamics of The quadrotor's rotation and manipulator configuration, which assumes The form of standard Lagrange dynamics of robotic manipulator with full-Actuation and no gravity effect. Relying on This structure, we propose a novel backstepping-like end-effector Tracking control law, which can allow us To assign different roles for The center-of-mass control and for The internal rotational dynamics control according To Task objectives. Simulations using a planar quadrotor with a 2-DOF arm are also performed To show The Theory.","authors":["Hyunsoo Yang","Dongjun Lee"],"meta":["May 2014Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","DOI:10.1109/ICRA.2014.6907674","Conference: 2014 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)"],"references":["261353596_Exploiting_redundancy_in_Cartesian_impedance_control_of_UAVs_equipped_with_a_robotic_arm","241689623_Closed-Loop_Behavior_of_an_Autonomous_Helicopter_Equipped_with_a_Robotic_Arm_for_Aerial_Manipulation_Tasks","224567374_A_Control_Approach_for_Thrust-Propelled_Underactuated_Vehicles_and_its_Application_to_VTOL_Drones","224195895_Passive_Decomposition_and_Control_of_Nonholonomic_Mechanical_Systems","221043988_Passive_Configuration_Decomposition_and_Practical_Stabilization_of_Nonholonomic_Mechanical_Systems_with_Symmetry","283672949_Backstepping_Control_of_Quadrotor-Type_UAVs_and_Its_Application_to_Teleoperation_over_the_Internet","267491950_Mechanics_and_Control_of_Quadrotors_for_Tool_Operation","261431302_Dynamic_stability_of_a_mobile_manipulating_unmanned_aerial_vehicle","261431301_Control_of_an_aerial_robot_with_multi-link_arm_for_assembly_tasks","261353420_Aerial_manipulation_using_a_quadrotor_with_a_two_DOF_robotic_arm","260514922_Passive_Decomposition_of_Mechanical_Systems_With_Coordination_Requirement","260330653_Motion_Planning_and_Stabilization_Control_of_a_Multipropeller_Multifunction_Aerial_Robot","256660645_Distributed_Backstepping_Control_of_Multiple_Thrust-Propelled_Vehicles_on_Balanced_Graph","254041341_Trajectory_generation_for_swing-free_maneuvers_of_a_quadrotor_with_suspended_payload_A_dynamic_programming_approach","227602323_Robust_trajectory_tracking_for_a_scale_model_autonomous_helicopter","224557373_Performing_aggressive_maneuvers_using_iterative_learning_control","224252720_Grasping_from_the_air_Hovering_capture_and_load_stability","221344572_Cooperative_Manipulation_and_Transportation_with_Aerial_Robots","221067226_Autonomous_indoor_aerial_gripping_using_a_quadrotor","3869503_Trajectory_tracking_control_design_for_autonomous_helicopters_using_a_backstepping_algorithm"]}
