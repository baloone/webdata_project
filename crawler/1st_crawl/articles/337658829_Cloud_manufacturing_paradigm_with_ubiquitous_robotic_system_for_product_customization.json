{"id":"337658829_Cloud_manufacturing_paradigm_with_ubiquitous_robotic_system_for_product_customization","abstract":"In the new era of Industry 4.0, traditional manufacturing plants are forced to transform into smart factories with cyber-physical product creation systems. Robots are believed to be one of the key components of such systems. This paper presents an architecture of using cloud-based ubiquitous robotic systems for smart manufacturing of the customized product. A framework for designing a cloud-based ubiquitous robotic system (URS) is developed, which consists of the function, structure and behavior of a URS. After that, a procedure for the development of such a URS is provided. Finally, the implementation of a cloud-based ubiquitous robotic system for smart producing and assembly of a customized product shows that the proposed approach can achieve the goal of smart manufacturing of customized product by developing cloud-based ubiquitous robotic systems.","authors":["Zhinan Zhang","Xin Wang","Xiaoxiao Zhu","Qixin Cao"],"meta":["December 2019Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing 60(1):12-22","DOI:10.1016/j.rcim.2019.05.015"],"references":["329196487_Cloud-based_manufacturing_equipment_and_big_data_analytics_to_enable_on-demand_manufacturing_services","320623741_Smart_Manufacturing_Characteristics_Technologies_and_Enabling_Factors","314151242_Cloud-Based_Manufacturing_Old_Wine_in_New_Bottles","313733013_Towards_product_customization_and_personalization_in_IoT-enabled_cloud_manufacturing","304663294_Ubiquitous_Robotic_Technology_for_Smart_Manufacturing_System","293196614_Ubiquitous_manufacturing_system_based_on_Cloud_A_robotics_application","284035674_Cloud-based_manufacturing-as-a-service_environment_for_customized_products","284001571_Customized_production_based_on_distributed_3D_printing_services_in_cloud_manufacturing","277594751_Cloud_Computing_for_Cloud_Manufacturing_Benefits_and_Limitations","272121074_Cloud_manufacturing_From_concept_to_practice","266880452_Cloud_manufacturing_A_computing_and_service-oriented_manufacturing_model","257745806_Evolving_Paradigms_of_Manufacturing_From_Mass_Production_to_Mass_Customization_and_Personalization","251566138_An_interoperable_solution_for_Cloud_manufacturing","236671408_Cloud_Manufacturing_Strategic_Vision_and_State-of-the-Art","233598150_Supply-chain_integration_Implications_for_mass_customization_modularization_and_postponement_strategies","228882605_Make_to_order_make-To-stock_or_delay_product_differentiation_A_common_framework_for_modeling_and_analysis","228217244_RepRap_The_Replicating_Rapid_Prototyper_Maximizing_Customizability_by_Breeding_the_Means_of_Production","227446936_Modeling_the_Costs_and_Benefits_of_Delayed_Product_Differentiation","225252747_Cloud_Computing_State-of-the-art_and_Research_Challenges","224296533_Seamless_integration_of_robots_and_tiny_embedded_devices_in_a_PEIS-Ecology","224259118_Secure_cloud_computing_Benefits_risks_and_controls","222557826_Network_robot_systems","220535168_Product-Line_Competition_Customization_vs_Proliferation","220381648_Rapid_manufacturing_facilitated_customization","5153035_Product_Uniqueness_as_a_Driver_of_Customer_Utility_in_Mass_Customization","330026358_Introduction_and_configuration_of_a_collaborative_robot_in_an_assembly_task_as_a_means_to_decrease_occupational_risks_and_increase_efficiency_in_a_manufacturing_company","314149759_Cloud-Based_Design_and_Manufacturing_A_New_Paradigm_in_Digital_Manufacturing_and_Design_Innovation","309761837_Study_on_ubiquitous_robotic_systems_for_smart_manufacturing_program","292212377_Ubiquitous_manufacturing_Current_practices_challenges_and_opportunities","290203525_Advanced_manufacturing_solution_to_industry_40_trend_through_sensing_network_and_Cloud_Computing_technologies","281132109_A_context-aware_approach_in_realization_of_socially_intelligent_industrial_robots","279556299_Key_technologies_for_the_construction_of_manufacturing_cloud","278742116_Progress_in_triboelectric_nanogenertors_as_new_energy_technology_and_self-powered_sensors","271424285_Research_and_application_of_the_management_and_control_platform_oriented_the_cloud_manufacturing_services","262159200_Ubiquitous_Robotics_Recent_Challenges_and_Future_Trends","260686269_Planar_Wireless_Charging_Technology_for_Portable_Electronic_Products_and_Qi","258528412_Adding_Value_in_Additive_Manufacturing_Researchers_in_the_United_Kingdom_and_Europe_Look_to_3D_Printing_for_Customization","241088839_3-D_printingThe_new_industrial_revolution","235296058_A_consumer-driven_model_for_mass_customization_in_the_apparel_market","232883836_Evaluation_of_postponement_strategies_in_mass_customization_with_service_guarantees","229131933_From_cloud_computing_to_cloud_manufacturing","228803752_The_third_generation_of_robotics_Ubiquitous_robot","228361785_The_peis_kernel_A_middleware_for_ubiquitous_robotics","223534592_A_virtual_prototyping_system_for_rapid_product_development","222405286_Modelling_and_optimisation_of_Rapid_Prototyping","220175027_Refining_and_Extending_the_Business_Model_With_Information_Technology_Dell_Computer_Corporation","4196106_Service-oriented_integration_of_networked_robots_with_ubiquitous_sensors_and_devices_using_the_Semantic_Web_Services_technology"]}
