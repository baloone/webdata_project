{"id":"332170279_Kinematic_analysis_of_a_tyre_rolling_over_rough_terrain_using_digital_image_correlation","abstract":"The rolling contact of the tyre-road interface is a core problem in vehicle dynamics. The contact interface dictates all the forces and moments generated between the tyre and the road. The velocity and contact deformation is of great interest when analysing the force generation of a tyre at the tyre-road interface. This paper proposes a method to analyse the velocity and deformation of a tyre over rough terrain using two cameras and digital image correlation. The method will generate full 3D view of the tyre-road interface viewed from the side. From the 3D profile it is possible to determine the velocity profile and deformation of the side wall of the tyre as well as the vehicle speed. This method can be used to better understand the rolling contact interface between a pneumatic tyre rolling over rough terrain.","authors":["Theunis Botha","Barys Shyrokau","Schalk Els","Edward Holweg"],"meta":["October 2015","Conference: 13th ISTVS European ConferenceAt: Rome","Project: EVE - INNOVATIVE ENGINEERING OF GROUND VEHICLES WITH INTEGRATED ACTIVE CHASSIS SYSTEMS "],"references":["235951826_A_Versatile_Flat_Track_Tire_Testing_Machine_A_Versatile_Flat_Track_Tire_Testing_Machine","346062683_Lucas-Kanade_20_Years_On_A_Unifying_Framework","275057952_SURF_Speeded_up_robust_features","256156818_Theoretical_and_Experimental_Studies_on_the_Dynamic_Properties_of_Tyres_Part_1_Review_of_Theories_of_Rubber_Friction","253248216_Dynamic_shape_and_strain_measurements_of_rotating_tire_using_a_sampling_moire_method","245552421_The_Impact_of_Tire_Measurement_Data_on_Tire_Modeling_and_Vehicle_Dynamics_Analysis","233481957_Extensions_of_the_LuGre_tyre_friction_model_related_to_variable_slip_speed_along_the_contact_patch_length","232851524_FTire_A_physically_based_application-oriented_tyre_model_for_use_with_detailed_MBS_and_finite-element_suspension_models","227159498_Sampling_Moir_Method_for_Accurate_Small_Deformation_Distribution_Measurement","224999440_Stereo_Processing_by_Semi-Global_Matching_and_Mutual_Information"]}
