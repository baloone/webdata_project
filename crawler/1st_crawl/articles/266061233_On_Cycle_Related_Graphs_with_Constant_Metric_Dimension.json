{"id":"266061233_On_Cycle_Related_Graphs_with_Constant_Metric_Dimension","abstract":"Let G be a connected graph. A set of vertices W resolves a graph G, if every vertex of G is uniquely determined by its distances to the vertices in W. The minimum cardinality of a resolving set of G is called the metric dimension of G. In this paper, we show that the graphs P n 2 , P n 3 , M(P n ) and T(P n ) have constant metric dimension.","authors":["Murtaza Ali","Gohar Ali","Usman Ali","M.T.
