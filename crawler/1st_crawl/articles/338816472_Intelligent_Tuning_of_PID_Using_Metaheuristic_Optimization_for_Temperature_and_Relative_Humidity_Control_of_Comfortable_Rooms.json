{"id":"338816472_Intelligent_Tuning_of_PID_Using_Metaheuristic_Optimization_for_Temperature_and_Relative_Humidity_Control_of_Comfortable_Rooms","abstract":"In order to provide the comfortable areas for human, the comfortable rooms are the basic needs area, controlled temperature, and relative humidity (RH). The aim of this study is to control and maintain the temperature and RH of the comfortable room using a proportional integral derivative (PID) controller tuned by metaheuristic optimization. In tuning gains of the PID controller, the modern metaheuristic optimizations, ant colony optimization (ACO), and symbiotic organism search (SOS) are applied and the performance of the proposed control system is compared to that of the traditional methods. In the experimental testing, the controlled room size is tested in the area of width 7.80 m, length 8.00 m, and height 3.80 m. The simulation results show that the performance of the proposed control system-tuned gains of PID controllers by using SOS algorithm has the least steady-state error with 15% rise time and also the overshoot can reach the setpoint. In the case of disturbance occurring in the system, the proposed control system is able to approach the setpoint. Therefore, the PID controller tuned by SOS algorithm can regulate the temperature and humidity of the comfortable room, proficiently.","authors":["K.
