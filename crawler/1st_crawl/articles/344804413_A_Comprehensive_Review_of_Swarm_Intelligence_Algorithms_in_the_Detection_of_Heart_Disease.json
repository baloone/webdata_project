These algorithms are namely, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm and Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm. By addressing the two swarm optimization algorithms for finding the complex medical diagnosis in the detection of heart disease where human knowledge is apprehended in a general manner. The database used for heart disease detection is Cleveland database obtained from UCI (User Client Identification) Machine Learning Repository. This database contains 76 attributes, but a subset of 14 of them in which 13 are taken as input values and 1 prediction values as an output. Enhancing the results of heart disease detection is based on the best optimistic algorithm of PSO and ABC algorithms.","authors":["Pagalla Bhavani Shankar"],"meta":["October 2020IOSR Journal of Computer Engineering 20(3):1-04","DOI:10.9790/0661-2003040104"],"references":["225739153_Application_of_a_particle_swarm_optimization_algorithm_for_determining_optimum_well_location_and_type","221204906_A_New_Particle_Swarm_Optimization_Algorithm_for_Neural_Network_Optimization"]}
