{"id":"220817513_Integrating_Probabilistic_Extraction_Models_and_Data_Mining_to_Discover_Relations_and_Patterns_in_Text","abstract":"In order for relation extraction systems to obtain human-level performance, they must be able to incorporate relational pat- terns inherent in the data (for example, that one's sister is likely one's mother's daughter, or that children are likely to attend the same college as their par- ents). Hand-coding such knowledge can be time-consuming and inadequate. Addi- tionally, there may exist many interesting, unknown relational patterns that both im- prove extraction performance and provide insight into text. We describe a probabilis- tic extraction model that provides mutual benefits to both \"top-down\" relational pat- tern discovery and \"bottom-up\" relation extraction.","authors":["Aron Culotta","Andrew Mccallum","Jonathan Betz"],"meta":["January 2006","DOI:10.3115/1220835.1220873","SourceDBLP","Conference: Human Language Technology Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association of Computational Linguistics, Proceedings, June 4-9, 2006, New York, New York, USA"],"references":["228394091_Combining_lexical_syntactic_and_semantic_features_with_Maximum_Entropy_models_for_extracting_relations","2572259_A_Note_on_the_Unification_of_Information_Extraction_and_Data_Mining_using_Conditional-Probability_Relational_Models","2537912_A_Novel_Use_of_Statistical_Parsing_to_Extract_Information_from_Text","2482149_Snowball_Extracting_Relations_from_Large_Plain-Text_Collections","2376325_Maximum_Entropy_Modeling_with_Clausal_Constraints","283429954_A_mutually_beneficial_integration_of_data_mining_and_information_extraction","262406121_Dynamic_Conditional_Random_Fields_Factorized_Probabilistic_Models_for_Labeling_and_Segmenting_Sequence_Data","235246939_An_Introduction_to_Conditional_Random_Fields_for_Relational_Learning","221619652_Subsequence_Kernels_for_Relation_Extraction","221603479_Learning_to_Extract_Symbolic_Knowledge_from_the_World_Wide_Web","220874749_Multi-Field_Information_Extraction_and_Cross-Document_Fusion","220873244_Dependency_Tree_Kernels_for_Relation_Extraction","220520188_Mining_knowledge_from_text_using_information_extraction","220320716_Kernel_Methods_for_Relation_Extraction","220017648_MALLET_A_machine_learning_for_language_toolkit","215470767_Semi-Markov_Conditional_Random_Fields_for_Information_Extraction","2884988_Probabilistic_Reasoning_for_Entity_Relation_Recognition","2788606_Extracting_Patterns_and_Relations_from_the_World_Wide_Web","2705623_Learning_Relations_by_Pathfinding","2605436_Confidence_Estimation_for_Information_Extraction","2559145_Untangling_Text_Data_Mining","2529190_Conditional_Random_Fields_Probabilistic_Models_for_Segmenting_and_Labeling_Sequence_Data","2475711_Information_Extraction_from_Multi-Document_Threads"]}
