{"id":"325222004_Development_of_modified_discrete_particle_swarm_optimization_algorithm_for_quadratic_assignment_problems","abstract":"Particle swarm optimization has been established to be one of the efficient algorithms for finding solutions for continuous optimization problems. The discretized form of particle swarm optimization, known as the discrete particle swarm optimization is an efficient tool for solving combinatorial optimization problems and other problems involving discrete variables. In this paper, a revised version of the discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm is proposed for solving Quadratic Assignment Problems (QAP). Instead of using the general velocity and position update procedures in particle swarm optimization algorithms, four different possible positions are found out for each particle and the best among them is accepted as the updated position. The algorithm is applied to solve some benchmark instances of QAP taken from QAP Library and the results show minute deviations from best-known solutions.","authors":["Pradeepmon T.G.","Rajagopalan Sridharan","Vinay Panicker"],"meta":["October 2018International Journal of Industrial Engineering Computations 9(4):491-508","DOI:10.5267/j.ijiec.2017.11.003"],"references":["308571106_Parameter_Selection_of_Discrete_Particle_Swarm_Optimization_Algorithm_for_the_Quadratic_Assignment_Problems","282773612_A_Comprehensive_Survey_on_Particle_Swarm_Optimization_Algorithm_and_Its_Applications","282590022_Particle_Swarm_Algorithm_Variants_for_the_Quadratic_Assignment_Problems_-_A_Probabilistic_Learning_Approach","275716879_A_multi-parent_genetic_algorithm_for_the_quadratic_assignment_problem","299272099_Performance_of_chaos_and_burst_noises_injected_to_the_Hopfield_NN_for_quadratic_assignment_problems","287761009_Suppression_of_hand_tremor_model_using_active_force_control_with_particle_swarm_optimization_and_differential_evolution","286656113_Hybrid_Particle_Swarm_Optimization_with_wavelet_mutation_based_segmentation_and_progressive_transmission_technique_for_MRI_images","286201957_A_discrete_particle_swarm_optimization_algorithm_for_job-shop_scheduling_problem_to_maximizing_production","284677567_Particle_swarm_optimization_Developments_application_and_resources","278712692_Computational_Study_of_Four_Genetic_Algorithm_Variants_for_Solving_the_Quadratic_Assignment_Problem"]}
