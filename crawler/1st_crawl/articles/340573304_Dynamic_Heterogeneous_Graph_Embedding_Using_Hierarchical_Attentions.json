{"id":"340573304_Dynamic_Heterogeneous_Graph_Embedding_Using_Hierarchical_Attentions","abstract":"Graph embedding has attracted many research interests. Existing works mainly focus on static homogeneous/heterogeneous networks or dynamic homogeneous networks. However, dynamic heterogeneous networks are more ubiquitous in reality, e.g. social network, e-commerce network, citation network, etc. There is still a lack of research on dynamic heterogeneous graph embedding. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic heterogeneous graph embedding method using hierarchical attentions (DyHAN) that learns node embeddings leveraging both structural heterogeneity and temporal evolution. We evaluate our method on three real-world datasets. The results show that DyHAN outperforms various state-of-the-art baselines in terms of link prediction task.","authors":["Luwei Yang","Xiao Zhibo","Wen Jiang","Yi Wei"],"meta":["April 2020","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-45442-5_53","In book: Advances in Information Retrieval, 42nd European Conference on IR Research, ECIR 2020, Lisbon, Portugal, April 14â€“17, 2020, Proceedings, Part II (pp.425-432)"],"references":["332257507_Relationship_Prediction_in_Dynamic_Heterogeneous_Information_Networks","326206361_Dynamic_Network_Embedding_An_Extended_Approach_for_Skip-gram_based_Network_Embedding","325616540_Graph_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_Web-Scale_Recommender_Systems","321374788_Heterogeneous_Information_Network_Embedding_for_Recommendation","318916856_metapath2vec_Scalable_Representation_Learning_for_Heterogeneous_Networks","317399572_Inductive_Representation_Learning_on_Large_Graphs","273471480_LINE_Large-scale_Information_Network_Embedding","338759561_DySAT_Deep_Neural_Representation_Learning_on_Dynamic_Graphs_via_Self-Attention_Networks","334714533_Representation_Learning_for_Attributed_Multiplex_Heterogeneous_Network","333076476_Heterogeneous_Graph_Attention_Network","320727381_Graph_Attention_Networks","317558625_Attention_Is_All_You_Need","307991731_Semi-Supervised_Classification_with_Graph_Convolutional_Networks","305997704_node2vec_Scalable_Feature_Learning_for_Networks","261136952_DeepWalk_Online_Learning_of_Social_Representations"]}
