{"id":"281607305_On_Repeated_Zero-Sum_Games_with_Incomplete_Information_and_Asymptotically_Bounded_Values","abstract":"We consider repeated zero-sum games with incomplete information on the side\nof Player2 with the total payoff given by the non-normalized sum of stage\ngains. In the classical examples he value $V_N$ of such $N$-stage game is of\nthe order of $N$ or $\\sqrt{N}$ as $N\\to \\infty$.\nOur aim is to present a general framework for another asymptotic behavior of\nthe value $V_N$ observed for the discrete version of the financial market model\nintroduced by De Meyer and Saley. For this game Domansky and independently De\nMeyer with Marino found that $V_N$ remains bounded as $N\\to\\infty$ and\nconverges to the limiting value. This game is almost-fair, i.e. if Player1\nforgets his private information the value becomes zero.\nWe describe a class of almost-fair games having bounded values in terms of an\neasy-checkable property of the auxiliary non-revealing game. We call this\nproperty the trigger property and it says that there exists an optimal strategy\nof Player2 that is piecewise-constant as a function of a prior distribution\n$p$. Discrete market models have the trigger property. We show that for\nnon-trigger almost-fair games with additional non-degeneracy condition $V_N$ is\nof the order of $\\sqrt{N}$.","authors":["Fedor Sandomirskiy"],"meta":["March 2018Dynamic Games and Applications 8(1)","DOI:10.1007/s13235-017-0217-7","SourcearXiv"],"references":["279830465_Price_dynamics_on_a_risk_averse_market_with_asymmetric_information","307555205_Repeated_Bidding_Games_with_Incomplete_Information_and_Bounded_Values_On_the_Exponential_Speed_of_Convergence","305982650_The_maximal_variation_of_a_bounded_martingale","302070609_Bidding_games_with_several_risky_assets","287541034_Approachability_fast_and_slow","285503822_Repeated_games_of_incomplete_information_An_approach_to_the_non-zero_sum_case","281047402_Extensions_of_the_Cavu_theorem_for_repeated_games_with_one-sided_information","273343648_Extensions_of_the_Cavu_Theorem_for_Repeated_Games_with_Incomplete_Information_on_One_Side","268022629_Repeated_games_with_asymmetric_information_modeling_financial_markets_with_two_risky_assets","267166530_Covariance_Control_Problems_over_Martingales_with_Fixed_Terminal_Distribution_Arising_from_Game_Theory"]}
