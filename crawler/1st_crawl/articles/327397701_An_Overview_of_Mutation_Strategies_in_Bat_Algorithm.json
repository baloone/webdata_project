{"id":"327397701_An_Overview_of_Mutation_Strategies_in_Bat_Algorithm","abstract":"Bat algorithm (BA) is a population based stochastic search technique encouraged from the intrinsic manner of bee swarm seeking for their food source. BA has been mostly used to resolve diverse kind of optimization problems and one of major issue faced by BA is frequently captured in local optima meanwhile handling the complex real world problems. Many authors improved the standard BA with different mutation strategies but an exhausted comprehensive overview about mutation strategies is still lacking. This paper aims to furnish a concise and comprehensive study of problems and challenges that prevent the performance of BA. It has been tried to provide guidelines for the researchers who are active in the area of BA and its mutation strategies. The objective of this study is divided in two sections: primarily to display the improvement of BA with mutation strategies that may enhance the performance of standard BA up to great extent and secondly, to motivate the researchers and developers for using BA to solve the complex real world problems. This study presents a comprehensive survey of the various BA algorithms based on mutation strategies. It is anticipated that this survey would be helpful to study the BA algorithm in detail for the researcher.
