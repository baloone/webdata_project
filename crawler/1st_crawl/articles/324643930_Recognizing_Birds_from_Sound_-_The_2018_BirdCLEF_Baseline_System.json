{"id":"324643930_Recognizing_Birds_from_Sound_-_The_2018_BirdCLEF_Baseline_System","abstract":"Reliable identification of bird species in recorded audio files would be a transformative tool for researchers, conservation biologists, and birders. In recent years, artificial neural networks have greatly improved the detection quality of machine learning systems for bird species recognition. We present a baseline system using convolutional neural networks. We publish our code base as reference for participants in the 2018 LifeCLEF bird identification task and discuss our experiments and potential improvements.","authors":["Stefan Kahl","Thomas Wilhelm-Stein","Holger Klinck","Danny Kowerko"],"meta":["April 2018","Project: localizeIT"],"references":["322144806_Large-Scale_Bird_Sound_Classification_using_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","318899617_LifeCLEF_2017_Lab_Overview_Multimedia_Species_Identification_Challenges","306885833_Densely_Connected_Convolutional_Networks","320822473_Two_convolutional_neural_networks_for_bird_detection_in_audio_signals","317723686_Trainable_frontend_for_robust_and_far-field_keyword_spotting","296810804_Nature's_music_The_science_of_birdsong","221345737_Rectified_Linear_Units_Improve_Restricted_Boltzmann_Machines_Vinod_Nair"]}
