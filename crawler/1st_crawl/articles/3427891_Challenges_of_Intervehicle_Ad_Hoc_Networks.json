{"id":"3427891_Challenges_of_Intervehicle_Ad_Hoc_Networks","abstract":"Intervehicle communication (IVC) networks, a subclass of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), have no fixed infrastructure and instead rely on the nodes themselves to provide network functionality. However, due to mobility constraints, driver behavior, and high mobility, IVC networks exhibit characteristics that are dramatically different from many generic MANETs. This paper elicits these differences through simulations and mathematical models and then explores the impact of the differences on the IVC communication architecture, including important security implications.","authors":["Jeremy J.
