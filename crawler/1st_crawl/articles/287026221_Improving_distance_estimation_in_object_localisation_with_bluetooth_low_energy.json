{"id":"287026221_Improving_distance_estimation_in_object_localisation_with_bluetooth_low_energy","abstract":"The arrival of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) creates opportunities for great innovations. One possible application is object localisation. We present our unique software that can track objects and help finding their location within a house perimeter. With the help of Bluetooth beacons that can be attached to different items, we can estimate the distance between the mobile device and the object with an accuracy of less than one meter. In this paper, we describe our system and the techniques we use, the experiments we conducted along with the results. In addition, we briefly present some work in progress using an indoor positioning system that helps locating the objects.","authors":["G.
