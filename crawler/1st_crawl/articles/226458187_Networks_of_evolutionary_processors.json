{"id":"226458187_Networks_of_evolutionary_processors","abstract":"In this paper we consider networks of evolutionary processors as language generating and computational devices. When the\nfilters are regular languages one gets the computational power of Turing machines with networks of size at most six, depending\non the underlying graph. When the filters are defined by random context conditions, we obtain an incomparability result with\nthe families of regular and context-free languages. Despite their simplicity, we show how the latter networks might be used\nfor solving an NP-complete problem, namely the “3-colorability problem”, in linear time and linear resources (nodes, symbols,\nrules).","authors":["Juan Castellanos","Carlos Martín-Vide","Victor Mitrana","José M.
