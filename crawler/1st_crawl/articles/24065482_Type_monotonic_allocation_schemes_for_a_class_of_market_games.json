{"id":"24065482_Type_monotonic_allocation_schemes_for_a_class_of_market_games","abstract":"We consider an extension of glove markets, called T-markets, characterize a family of weighted allocation rules, and define\nrelated cooperative games. For the class of T-market games we introduce a new solution concept called the type monotonic allocation\nscheme. It turns out that the nucleolus and the Ï„-value generate the same type monotonic allocation scheme with nice extra properties.","authors":["Tamas Solymosi","Rodica Branzei","Stef Tijs"],"meta":["February 2007Top 15(1):78-88","DOI:10.1007/s11750-007-0002-7","SourceRePEc"],"references":["227338782_Monotonic_Allocation_Schemes_In_Clan_Games","225983316_On_the_core_of_linear_production_games","284289939_A_Value_for_n-Person_Games","265353515_The_solutions_of_a_symmetric_market_game","254438029_On_Big_Boss_Games","249335443_Formation_of_cartels_in_glove_markets_and_the_modiclus","239665858_Bounds_for_the_core_and_the-value","239064214_Some_theorems_on_n-person_games","239061811_The_Nucleolus_of_a_Characteristic_Function_Game","226005064_Drop_out_monotonic_rules_for_sequencing_situations"]}
