{"id":"349902704_On_Partition_Dimension_of_Some_Cycle-Related_Graphs","abstract":"Let G be a simple connected graph. Suppose Δ=Δ1,Δ2,…,Δl an l-partition of VG. A partition representation of a vertex α w.r.t Δ is the l−vector dα,Δ1,dα,Δ2,…,dα,Δl, denoted by rα|Δ. Any partition Δ is referred as resolving partition if ∀αi≠αj∈VG such that rαi|Δ≠rαj|Δ. The smallest integer l is referred as the partition dimension pdG of G if the l-partition Δ is a resolving partition. In this article, we discuss the partition dimension of kayak paddle graph, cycle graph with chord, and a graph generated by chain of cycles. It has been shown that the partition dimension of the said families of graphs is constant.","authors":["Changcheng Wei","Faisal Nadeem","Hafiz Muhammad Afzal Siddiqui","Muhammad Azeem"],"meta":["March 2021Mathematical Problems in Engineering 2021(4):1-8","DOI:10.1155/2021/4046909"],"references":["349862314_On_upper_dimension_of_graphs_and_their_bases_sets","343997210_On_graphs_with_same_metric_and_upper_dimension","326574158_On_partition_dimension_of_fullerene_graphs","307015217_Partition_dimension_of_honeycomb_derived_networks","282453993_THE_PARTITION_DIMENSION_OF_HOMOGENEOUS_FIRECRACKERS","346975875_On_sharp_bounds_of_the_Partition_Dimension_of_Convex_Polytoes","341047223_Computing_the_metric_dimension_of_Kayak_Paddles_graph_and_Cycles_with_chord","330475035_Upper_dimension_and_bases_of_zero-divisor_graphs_of_commutative_rings","303151748_Leaves_of_trees","284229630_Browsable_structure-activity_datasets"]}
