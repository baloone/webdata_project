{"id":"221456188_Logics_of_propositional_control","abstract":"ABSTRACT The ‘Cooperation Logic of Propositional Control’, cl-pc, of van der Hoek and Wooldridge is a logic for reasoning about the ability of agents and groups of agents to obtain a certain state of aairs,in a situation in which each of the agents controls a number,of propositional variables. We present a number of generalizations of this model, to represent situations in which agents only partially control the value of a variable, or cases in which agents share the control of a variable. We discuss and axiomatize some of these logics of ‘partial control.’ In addition, we show how this family of logics are closely connected to a body of work in mathematical logic: Cylindric Modal Logic.
