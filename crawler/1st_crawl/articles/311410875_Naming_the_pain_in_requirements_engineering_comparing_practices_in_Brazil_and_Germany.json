{"id":"311410875_Naming_the_pain_in_requirements_engineering_comparing_practices_in_Brazil_and_Germany","abstract":"As part of the Naming the Pain in Requirements Engineering (NaPiRE) initiative, researchers compared problems that companies in Brazil and Germany encountered during requirements engineering (RE). The key takeaway was that in RE, human interaction is necessary for eliciting and specifying high-quality requirements, regardless of country, project type, or company size.","authors":["Daniel Méndez Fernández","Stefan Wagner","Marcos Kalinowski","Andre Schekelmann"],"meta":["January 2015","DOI:10.18419/opus-8947","Project: NaPiRE: Naming the Pain in Requirements Engineering"],"references":["253953619_Evidence-Based_Guidelines_to_Defect_Causal_Analysis","4250874_Research_Directions_in_Requirements_Engineering","262569274_Naming_the_Pain_in_Requirements_Engineering_A_Design_for_a_Global_Family_of_Surveys_and_First_Results_from_Germany","220068919_An_Empirical_Study_of_the_Complex_Relationships_between_Requirements_Engineering_Processes_and_Other_Processes_that_Lead_to_Payoffs_in_Productivity_Quality_and_Risk_Management"]}
