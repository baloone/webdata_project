{"id":"310809819_Ontology-based_smart_IoT_engine_for_personal_comfort_management","abstract":"In this paper we propose a new approach to complex comfort management based on ontologies, being the main result of undergoing GOLIATH project. The approach comprises an application of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, an abstraction layer (SITE), a smart IoT middleware and a Multi-Agent System (MAS). Those elements allow a user to ask the system in a simple and natural way to control one or more comfort elements (including temperature, humidity, luminosity, noise, ventilation and air quality). Shared knowledge fed by the IoT and its semantic environment (SITE) will be used by smart layers (Knowledge base and MAS) to reason and propose an action on one or more IoT devices in turn managed by SITE. The implementation is based on underlying ontologies of comfort and actions and real-world objects connected with IoT devices, as well as a dedicated Context-Aware System to deal with dynamic situation, time/place of an interaction, evolving requirements, etc.","authors":["Benjamin GÃ¢teau","Yannick Naudet","Jarogniew Rykowski"],"meta":["October 2016","DOI:10.1109/SMAP.2016.7753381","Conference: 2016 11th International Workshop on Semantic and Social Media Adaptation and Personalization (SMAP)","Project: GOLIATH (Goal Oriented Layered system for Inter-operable Activities of Things)"],"references":[]}
