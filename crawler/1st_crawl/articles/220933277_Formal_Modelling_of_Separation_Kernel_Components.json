{"id":"220933277_Formal_Modelling_of_Separation_Kernel_Components","abstract":"Separation kernels are key components in embedded applica- tions. Their small size and widespread use in high-integrity environments make them good targets for formal modelling and verification. We sum- marise results from the mechanisation of a separation kernel scheduler using the Z/Eves theorem prover. We concentrate on key data structures to model scheduler operations. The results are part of an experiment in a Grand Challenge in software verification, as part of a pilot project in verified OS kernels. The project aims at creating a mechanised formal model of kernel components that gets refined to code. This provides a set of reusable components, proof strategies, and general lemmas. Important findings about properties and requirements are also discussed.","authors":["Andrius Velykis","Leo Freitas"],"meta":["September 2010","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-14808-8_16","SourceDBLP","Conference: Theoretical Aspects of Computing - ICTAC 2010, 7th International Colloquium, Natal, Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil, September 1-3, 2010.
