{"id":"289821180_Extending_the_Engagement_Taxonomy","abstract":"As collaborative learning in general, and pair programming in particular, has become widely adopted in computer science education, so has the use of pedagogical visualization tools for facilitating collaboration. However, there is little theory on collaborative learning with visualization, and few studies on their effect on each other. We build on the concept of the engagement taxonomy and extend it to classify finer variations in the engagement that result from the use of a visualization tool. We analyze the applicability of the taxonomy to the description of the differences in the collaboration process when visualization is used. Our hypothesis is that increasing the level of engagement between learners and the visualization tool results in a higher positive impact of the visualization on the collaboration process. This article describes an empirical investigation designed to test the hypothesis. The results provide support for our extended engagement taxonomy and hypothesis by showing that the collaborative activities of the students and the engagement levels are correlated.","authors":["Niko Myller","Roman Bednarik","Erkki Sutinen","Mordechai Ben-Ari"],"meta":["March 2009ACM Transactions on Computing Education 9(1):1-27","DOI:10.1145/1513593.1513600"],"references":["234803199_Affective_effects_of_program_visualization","232474300_Measuring_the_Developmental_Features_of_Moral_Discussion","222567613_Visualization_of_participation_Does_it_contribute_to_successful_computer-supported_collaborative_learning","221425147_Integrating_Dynamic_Program_Visualization_into_BlueJ_the_Jeliot_3_Extension","220807660_A_Testbed_for_Pedagogical_Requirements_in_Algorithm_Visualizations","220729384_Pair_programming_and_the_re-appropriation_of_individual_tools_for_collaborative_programming","220370006_Peer_Review_of_Animations_Developed_by_Students","220369101_Automatic_Generation_of_Prediction_Questions_during_Program_Visualization","220309233_A_rating_scheme_for_assessing_the_quality_of_computer-supported_collaboration_processes_International_Journal_of_Computer-Supported_Collaborative_Learning_21_63-86","200772358_An_Experimental_Study_of_the_Effects_of_Representational_Guidance_on_Collaborative_Learning_Processes","200085937_Usability_Analysis_of_Visual_Programming_Environments_A_'Cognitive_Dimensions'_Framework","31597988_Analyzing_Engagement_Taxonomy_In_Collaborative_Algorithm_Visualization","2386182_The_BlueJ_System_and_its_Pedagogy","234827343_The_effective_use_of_quicksort_visualizations_in_the_classroom","228639641_Personalizing_and_discussing_algorithms_within_CS_1_Studio_Experiences_An_observational_study","222832588_Integrating_algorithm_visualization_technology_into_an_undergraduate_algorithms_course_Ethnographic_studies_of_a_social_constructivist_approach","222825891_The_Jeliot_2000_program_animation_system","222671398_Using_end-user_visualization_environments_to_mediate_conversations_A_'Communicative_Dimensions'_framework","222575700_Comparing_the_roles_of_representations_in_face-to-face_and_online_computer_supported_collaborative_learning","222564425_The_interactivity_effect_in_multimedia_learning","222560544_Designing_visualizing_and_discussing_algorithms_within_a_CS_1_studio_experience_An_empirical_study","222560093_What_You_See_Is_What_You_Code_A_live_algorithm_development_and_visualization_environment_for_novice_learners","222505084_Designing_Computer_Support_for_Collaborative_Visual_Learning_in_the_Domain_of_Computer_Programming","222408779_A_Meta-Study_of_Algorithm_Visualization_Effectiveness","221537971_On_understanding_the_statics_and_dynamics_of_object-oriented_programs","221536781_Constructive_and_Collaborative_Learning_of_Algorithms","221033669_A_new_method_to_assess_the_quality_of_collaborative_process_in_CSCL","220955859_Algorithm_Visualization_in_CS_Education_Comparing_Levels_of_Student_Engagement","220945136_Visualizing_Programs_with_Jeliot_3","220396240_JeCo_Combining_Program_Visualization_and_Story_Weaving","220107048_External_Cognition_How_do_Graphical_Representations_Work","22310512_The_Measurement_Of_Observer_Agreement_For_Categorical_Data","7556685_JHAVE_Supporting_algorithm_visualization","3247643_Strengthening_the_Case_for_Pair-Programming"]}
