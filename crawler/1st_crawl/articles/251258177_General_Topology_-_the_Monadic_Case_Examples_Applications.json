{"id":"251258177_General_Topology_-_the_Monadic_Case_Examples_Applications","abstract":"The paper deals with monadic as well as monadic-free topological notions. For defining these monadic-free notions the notion of basic triple F is introduced. A lot of monadic-free topological notions are presented, for instance that of F-convergence structure, F-hull operator and F-uniform structure. By means of a generalized metric, e.g. a probabilistic metric, and the general notion of F-zero approach introduced in this paper, a F-uniform structure is generated. In case of a fuzzy metric the related F-uniform structure defines in a canonic way a fuzzy topology which is used for developing a fuzzy analysis and fuzzy calculus.","authors":["W.
