{"id":"276964585_Modeling_of_Epilepsy_EEG_Signal_using_Prony's_Method","abstract":"Prony 's method is employed in spectral domain estimation to model epilepsy seizure from human's electroencephalograph (EEG).This method assumes that the original signal is a sum of damped complex exponential sinusoids. The method has the best frequency resolution compared to Auto Regression (AR) parametric methods. Modeling of the EEG Epilepsy signal is based on the poles of the signal. Computing the poles of the Prony's method, the signal Modeling is based on the location of the poles and number of poles. As we increase number of poles we can minimize the error due to signal reconstruction. The optimum number of poles is calculated to get the minimum error.","authors":["Osama A Elsayed","Ayman M.
