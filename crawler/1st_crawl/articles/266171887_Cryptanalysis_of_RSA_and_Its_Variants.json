{"id":"266171887_Cryptanalysis_of_RSA_and_Its_Variants","abstract":"The first resource to focus on the security variances of RSA, Cryptanalysis of RSA and Its Variants is a comprehensive survey of the best known algebraic attacks on RSA and its main variants, including Rebalanced RSA, Multi-prime RSA, and Multi-factor RSA. The preliminary material introduces RSA and reviews all the mathematical background needed for the remainder of the book. The next two parts collect together all the best known algebraic attacks. For each attack, the author provides a mathematical proof if possible, or a mathematical justification for those that rely on assumptions. For those attacks that cannot be proven, he provides experimental evidence to illustrate their practical effectiveness. This invaluable work will be of interest for researchers and graduate students interested in the cryptanalysis of public-key cryptosystems, RSA in particular, and also for researchers interested in applications of lattice basis reduction (based on Coppersmith's methods). In addition, it is suitable as a reference for the security of RSA and it variants.","authors":["M.
