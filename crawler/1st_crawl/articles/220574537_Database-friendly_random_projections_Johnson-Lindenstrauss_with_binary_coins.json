{"id":"220574537_Database-friendly_random_projections_Johnson-Lindenstrauss_with_binary_coins","abstract":"A classic result of Johnson and Lindenstrauss asserts that any set of n points in d-dimensional Euclidean space can be embedded into k-dimensional Euclidean space—where k is logarithmic in n and independent of d—so that all pairwise distances are maintained within an arbitrarily small factor. All known constructions of such embeddings involve projecting the n points onto a spherically random k-dimensional hyperplane through the origin. We give two constructions of such embeddings with the property that all elements of the projection matrix belong in f� 1; 0; þ1g: Such constructions are particularly well suited for database environments, as the computation of the embedding reduces to evaluating a single aggregate over k random partitions of the attributes.","authors":["Dimitris Achlioptas"],"meta":["June 2003Journal of Computer and System Sciences 66(4):671-687","DOI:10.1016/S0022-0000(03)00025-4","SourceDBLP"],"references":["301840852_Extensions_of_Lipschitz_mappings_into_a_Hilbert_space","235008656_Extensions_of_Lipschitz_maps_into_a_Hilbert_space","228057833_The_Geometry_of_Graphs_and_Some_of_Its_Algorithmic_Applications","3832183_An_algorithmic_theory_of_learning_Robust_concepts_and_random_projection","3593061_The_geometry_of_graphs_and_some_of_its_algorithmic_applications","2431490_Learning_Mixtures_of_Arbitrary_Gaussians","303784133_Learning_mixtures_of_gaussians","269200023_Latent_semantic_indexing","243392540_High-resolution_thermophysical_measurements_using_staring_infrared_detector_arrays","232624540_Stable_distributions_pseudorandom_generators_embeddings_and_data_stream_computation","222615318_The_Johnson-Lindenstrauss_lemma_and_the_sphericity_of_some_graphs","222553452_Latent_Semantic_Indexing_A_Probabilistic_Analysis","221590487_Clustering_for_edge-cost_minimization_extended_abstract","221498180_A_Random_Sampling_Based_Algorithm_for_Learning_the_Intersection_of_Half-spaces","3948670_Algorithmic_derandomization_via_complexity_theory","3832184_Learning_mixture_of_Gaussians","2508382_An_elementary_proof_of_the_Johnson-Lindenstrauss_Lemma","2361750_Database-friendly_Random_Projections","2320094_Approximate_Nearest_Neighbors_Towards_Removing_the_Curse_of_Dimensionality","2307057_Clustering_for_Edge-Cost_Minimization","2304195_Two_Algorithms_for_Nearest-Neighbor_Search_in_High_Dimensions","2276972_Efficient_Search_for_Approximate_Nearest_Neighbor_in_High_Dimensional_Spaces"]}
