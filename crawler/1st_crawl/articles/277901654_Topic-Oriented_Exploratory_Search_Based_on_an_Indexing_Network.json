{"id":"277901654_Topic-Oriented_Exploratory_Search_Based_on_an_Indexing_Network","abstract":"An exploratory search may be driven by a user's curiosity or desire for specific information. When users investigate unfamiliar fields, they may want to learn more about a particular subject area to increase their knowledge rather than solve a specific problem. This work proposes a topic-oriented exploratory search method that provides browse guidance to users. It allows them to discover new associations and knowledge, and helps them find their interested information and knowledge. Since an exploratory search needs to judge the ability to discover new knowledge, the existing commonly used metrics fail to capture it. This paper thus defines a new set of criteria containing clarity, relevance, novelty, and diversity to analyze the effectiveness of an exploratory search. Experiments are designed to compare results from the proposed method and Google's \"search related to ...\" The results show that the proposed one is more suitable for learning new associations and discovering new knowledge with highly likely relevance to a query. This work concludes that it is more suitable than Google for an exploratory search.","authors":["Haichun Sun","ChangJun Jiang","ZhiJun Ding","Pengwei Wang"],"meta":["January 2015IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems 46(2):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TSMC.2015.2421484"],"references":["264561759_Dynamic_Query_Forms_for_Database_Queries","260662715_Predicting_Stay_Time_of_Mobile_Users_With_Contextual_Information","260662502_Representation_and_Exchange_of_Knowledge_About_Actions_Objects_and_Environments_in_the_ROBOEARTH_Framework","260662501_A_Novel_Method_for_Calculating_Service_Reputation","254464389_Automatic_refinement_of_patent_queries_using_concept_importance_predictors","233984676_Combining_Computational_Analyses_and_Interactive_Visualization_for_Document_Exploration_and_Sensemaking_in_Jigsaw","224358167_JustClick_Personalized_Image_Recommendation_via_Exploratory_Search_From_Large-Scale_Flickr_Images","221869404_User_centered_and_ontology_based_information_retrieval_system_for_life_science_-_OBIRS","221614477_Concept-based_interactive_query_expansion","221613604_FACeTOR_Cost-driven_exploration_of_faceted_query_results","221301268_Selecting_good_expansion_terms_for_pseudo-relevance_feedback","221022942_Liquid_query_Multi-domain_exploratory_search_on_the_web","220566113_A_Survey_of_Automatic_Query_Expansion_in_Information_Retrieval","300766991_Adaptive_Classifiers_for_Nonstationary_Environments","300766904_Advances_and_Challenges_on_Intelligent_Learning_in_Control_Systems","288409805_Integrating_Particle_Swarm_Optimization_with_Learning_Automata_to_solve_optimization_problems_in_noisy_environment","286745212_A_new_class_of_learning_automata_for_selecting_an_optimal_subset","278324949_Graph-Based_Methods_for_Natural_Language_Processing_and_Understanding-A_Survey_and_Analysis","278289575_Supporting_Exploratory_Search","277430990_Web_page_classification","273394503_Radio_Channel_Allocations_With_Global_Optimality_and_Bounded_Computational_Scale","273391537_An_Indexing_Network_Model_and_Applications","269306071_A_weight-incorporated_similarity-based_clustering_ensemble_method","265645794_An_Interactive_Portfolio_Decision_Analysis_Approach_for_System-of-Systems_Architecting_Using_the_Graph_Model_for_Conflict_Resolution","263050929_An_Ontology-Based_Text_Mining_Method_to_Develop_D-Matrix_From_Unstructured_Text","262417647_Gaussian_Classifier-Based_Evolutionary_Strategy_for_Multimodal_Optimization","262056538_An_Efficient_Non-Negative_Matrix-Factorization-Based_Approach_to_Collaborative_Filtering_for_Recommender_Systems","261444838_Last-Position_Elimination-Based_Learning_Automata","261168631_An_Indexing_Network_Model_for_Information_Services_and_Its_Applications","261130585_A_Novel_Information_Search_and_Recommendation_Services_Platform_Based_on_an_Indexing_Network_Short_Paper","260711846_An_Empirical_Study_of_Ontology-Based_Multi-Document_Summarization_in_Disaster_Management","260662559_Swarm_Intelligence_Approaches_to_Optimal_Power_Flow_Problem_With_Distributed_Generator_Failures_in_Power_Networks","260652485_Predicting_Quality_of_Service_for_Selection_by_Neighborhood-Based_Collaborative_Filtering","260626239_Interactive_Query_Expansion_With_the_Use_of_Clustering-by-Directions_Algorithm","259263557_Supporting_Exploratory_Search_Tasks_with_Interactive_User_Modeling","258030046_Data_Providing_Services_Clustering_and_Management_for_Facilitating_Service_Discovery_and_Replacement","257626477_Multiple_perspective_interactive_search_A_paradigm_for_exploratory_search_and_information_retrieval_on_the_web","257457921_Exploratory_search_framework_for_Web_data_sources","254464765_Multi-aspect_query_summarization_by_composite_query","228380843_Design_recommendatons_for_hierarchial_faceted_search_interfaces","223449323_Semantic_Annotation_Based_Exploratory_Search_for_Information_Analysts","223117716_Buckley_C_Term-Weighting_Approaches_in_Automatic_Text_Retrieval_Information_Processing_Management_245_513-523","221300394_Query_Dependent_Pseudo-Relevance_Feedback_based_on_Wikipedia","221300335_Towards_Interactive_Query_Expansion","221299972_Personalized_query_expansion_for_the_web","221022103_Topic-oriented_query_expansion_for_Web_search","220566504_Web_page_classification_Features_and_algorithms","220515778_Bruce_Croft_W_Improving_the_effectiveness_of_information_retrieval_with_local_context_analysis_ACM_Transactions_on_Information_Systems_TOIS_181_79-112","220466718_Analysis_of_a_Very_Large_Web_Search_Engine_Query_Log","220319974_Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation","220269404_Navigating_the_tag_genome","220228998_Term-Weighting_Approaches_in_Automatic_Text_Retrieval","220017593_Probabilistic_Latent_Semantic_Indexing","200110408_Context-aware_query_suggestion_by_mining_click-through_and_session_data","42090204_Business_information_query_expansion_through_semantic_network"]}
