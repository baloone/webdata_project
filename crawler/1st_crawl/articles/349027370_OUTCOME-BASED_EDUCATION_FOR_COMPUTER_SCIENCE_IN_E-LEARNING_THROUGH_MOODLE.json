{"id":"349027370_OUTCOME-BASED_EDUCATION_FOR_COMPUTER_SCIENCE_IN_E-LEARNING_THROUGH_MOODLE","abstract":"Outcome Based Education (OBE) is a part of our education system in current scenario. In particular, E-learning in Computer Science, there are so many tools used in OBE to achieve a specified outcome, like Moodle. We introduced a new teaching pedagogy algorithm through Moodle and it was implemented in Galgotias University in India to make OBE as an effective methodology on Program Specific Outcomes (PSO). It had been proved on MATLAB software that, the Course Outcomes (CO) and the Program Outcomes (PO) attainment through integrated OBE (iOBE). This paper is a comparison between the didactic teaching methodology and Moodle Teaching Learning (T-L) tool in computer science education and proved that importance of Moodle as an effective T-L tool in computer science education.","authors":["Basetty Mallikarjuna","Dayananda P B Niranjanamurthy","Pardeep Kumar","Munish Sabharwal"],"meta":["December 2020PalArch's Journal of Archaeology of Egypt/ Egyptology 17(9):8740-8752"],"references":["312147615_A_critical_review_of_flipped_classroom_challenges_in_K-12_education_Possible_solutions_and_recommendations_for_future_research","297721040_Computer_science_CS_in_the_compulsory_education_curriculum_Implications_for_future_research","282603860_Computational_thinking_in_compulsory_education_Towards_an_agenda_for_research_and_practice","265051052_Motivation_and_cognitive_load_in_the_flipped_classroom_definition_rationale_and_a_call_for_research","241251310_Aligning_teaching_and_assessing_to_course_objectives","44199862_Using_video_lectures_to_make_teaching_more_interactive","301924942_Web-based_learning_enhancements_Video_lectures_through_voice-over_PowerPoint_in_a_majors-level_biology_course","298796258_Flipping_The_Classroom_Turning_An_Instructional_Methods_Course_Upside_Down","247718938_Humanistic_Versus_Traditional_Teaching_Styles_and_Student_Satisfaction","232175343_How_learning_in_an_inverted_classroom_influences_cooperation_innovation_and_task_orientation"]}
