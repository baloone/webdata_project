{"id":"313420106_Fast_Fourier_Transforms_for_Nonequispaced_Data","abstract":"A group of algorithms is presented generalizing the fast Fourier transform to the case of noninteger frequencies and nonequispaced nodes on the interval $[ - \\pi ,\\pi ]$. The schemes of this paper are based on a combination of certain analytical considerations with the classical fast Fourier transform and generalize both the forward and backward FFTs. Each of the algorithms requires $O(N\\cdot \\log N + N\\cdot \\log (1/\\varepsilon ))$ arithmetic operations, where $\\varepsilon $ is the precision of computations and N is the number of nodes. The efficiency of the approach is illustrated by several numerical examples.","authors":["Alok Dutt","Vladimir Rokhlin"],"meta":["January 1993SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing 14(6):1368-1393","DOI:10.1137/0914081"],"references":["242449456_Wavelet-Like_Bases_for_the_Fast_Solution_of_Second-Kind_Integral_Equations","275970953_An_Introduction_to_Numerical_Analysis","238979320_A_Fast_Adaptive_Multipole_Algorithm_for_Particle_Simulations","229099884_An_Algorithm_for_the_Machine_Calculation_of_Complex_Fourier_Series","227639870_Fast_Wavelet_Transforms_and_Numerical_Algorithms_I","220171877_A_fast_algorithm_for_the_discrete_laplace_transformation","200175466_Computational_Frameworks_for_the_Fast_Fourier_Transform_SIAM"]}
