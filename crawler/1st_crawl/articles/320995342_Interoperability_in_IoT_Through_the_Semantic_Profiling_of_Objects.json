{"id":"320995342_Interoperability_in_IoT_Through_the_Semantic_Profiling_of_Objects","abstract":"The emergence of smarter and broader peopleoriented IoT applications and services requires interoperability at both data and knowledge levels. However, although some semantic IoT architectures have been proposed, achieving a high degree of interoperability requires dealing with a sea of non-integrated data, scattered across vertical silos. Also, these architectures do not fit into the machine-to-machine (M2M) requirements, as data annotation has no knowledge on object interactions behind arriving data. This article presents a vision of how to overcome these issues. More specifically, the semantic profiling of objects, through CoRE related standards, is envisaged as the key for data integration, allowing more powerful data annotation, validation and reasoning. These are the key blocks for the development of intelligent applications.","authors":["Andriy Mazayev","Jaime Afonso Martins","No√©lia Correia"],"meta":["November 2017IEEE Access PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2763425"],"references":["279177017_Internet_of_Things_A_Survey_on_Enabling_Technologies_Protocols_and_Applications","271514745_RPL_IPv6_Routing_Protocol_for_Low_power_and_Lossy_Networks","269269896_A_comparison_of_the_popular_home_automation_technologies","256092056_The_SSN_Ontology_of_the_W3C_Semantic_Sensor_Network_Incubator_Group","301583827_Device_group_management_in_constrained_networks","239697589_BLUETOOTH_AND_IEEE_80211_WIRELESS_PROTOCOLSA_SURVEY_AND_A_COMPARISON","238676729_IPv6_over_Low-Power_Wireless_Personal_Area_Networks_6LoWPANs_Overview_Assumptions_Problem_Statement_and_Goals","224147961_LTE-advanced_Next-generation_wireless_broadband_technology"]}
