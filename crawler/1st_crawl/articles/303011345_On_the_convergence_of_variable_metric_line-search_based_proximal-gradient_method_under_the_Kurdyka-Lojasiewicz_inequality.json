{"id":"303011345_On_the_convergence_of_variable_metric_line-search_based_proximal-gradient_method_under_the_Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz_inequality","abstract":"We consider a variable metric line-search based proximal gradient method for the minimization of the sum of a smooth, possibly nonconvex function plus a convex, possibly nonsmooth term. The general convergence result on this method is the stationarity of any limit point of the sequence generated by the method, while convergence of the sequence itself to a minimum point has been proved recently for convex objective functions under some additional hypotheses. In this paper we show that the same convergence result can be proved if the objective function satisfies the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz property at each point of its domain, under the assumption that a limit point exists. The proposed method is applied to a wide collection of image processing problems and our numerical tests show that our algorithm results to be flexible, robust and competitive if compared to recently proposed approaches able to address the optimization problems arising in the considered applications.","authors":["Silvia Bonettini","Ignace Loris","Federica Porta","Marco Prato"],"meta":["May 2016"],"references":["277603404_Variable_Metric_Inexact_Line-Search-Based_Methods_for_Nonsmooth_Optimization","275670577_Splitting_Methods_with_Variable_Metric_for_Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz_Functions_and_General_Convergence_Rates","268743112_Variable_Metric_Forward-Backward_Algorithm_for_Minimizing_the_Sum_of_a_Differentiable_Function_and_a_Convex_Function","266571973_Convergence_of_Non-smooth_Descent_Methods_Using_the_Kurdyka-Aojasiewicz_Inequality","265201859_A_Block_Coordinate_Descent_Method_for_Regularized_Multiconvex_Optimization_with_Applications_to_Nonnegative_Tensor_Factorization_and_Completion","263811825_A_New_Steplength_Selection_for_Scaled_Gradient_Methods_with_Application_to_Image_Deblurring","262692285_An_Optimal_Control_Approach_to_Find_Sparse_Data_for_Laplace_Interpolation","261726149_iPiano_Inertial_Proximal_Algorithm_for_Non-Convex_Optimization","260289539_The_Lojasiewicz_inequality_for_nonsmooth_subanalytic_functions_with_applications_to_subgradient_dynamical_systems","259764910_Revisiting_Loss-Specific_Training_of_Filter-Based_MRFs_for_Image_Restoration","257480087_Proximal_alternating_linearized_minimization_for_nonconvex_and_nonsmooth_problems","256365833_Accelerated_And_Inexact_Forward-Backward_Algorithms","252604879_Iterative_image_reconstruction_A_point_of_view","239285544_Characterizations_of_Lojasiewicz_inequalities_Subgradient_flows_talweg_convexity","234144902_Inexact_and_accelerated_proximal_point_algorithms","229058374_Efficient_deconvolution_methods_for_astronomical_imaging_Algorithms_and_IDL-GPU_codes","229033529_Convergence_of_descent_methods_for_semi-algebraic_and_tame_problems_Proximal_algorithms_forward-backward_splitting_and_regularized_Gauss-Seidel_methods","228681404_The_Lojasiewicz_Inequality_for_Nonsmooth_Subanalytic_Functions_with_Applications_to_Subgradient_Dynamical_Systems","228083583_Variable_Metric_Forward-Backward_Splitting_with_Applications_to_MonotoneInclusions_in_Duality","225713470_Image_Compression_with_Anisotropic_Diffusion","224070847_Corrigendum_Efficient_gradient_projection_methods_for_edge-preserving_removal_of_Poisson_noise","224070843_Nonnegative_least-squares_image_deblurring_Improved_gradient_projection_approaches","222469583_Nonlinear_total_variation_based_noise_removal_algorithms","220589510_On_the_convergence_of_the_proximal_algorithm_for_nonsmooth_functions_involving_analytic_features","220442509_Proximal_Alternating_Minimization_and_Projection_Methods_for_Nonconvex_Problems_An_Approach_Based_on_the_Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz_Inequality","220133711_Clarke_Subgradients_of_Stratifiable_Functions","283993586_Une_propriete_topologique_des_sous-ensembles_analytiques_reels","283198227_Variational_Approach_for_Restoring_Blurred_Images_with_Cauchy_Noise","281488455_New_convergence_results_for_the_scaled_gradient_projection_method","278828781_On_the_convergence_of_the_iterates_of_FISTA","268245604_Convex_Analysis_in_General_Vector_Spaces","268020734_A_New_Semiblind_Deconvolution_Approach_for_Fourier-Based_Image_Restoration_An_Application_in_Astronomy","265368660_On_gradients_of_functions_definable_in_o-minimal_structures","263047897_Convex_Analysis_and_Minimization_Algorithms_II","243417695_Penalized_maximum_likelihood_image_restoration_with_positivity_constraints_Multiplicative_algorithms","239582331_Stochastic_Relaxation_Gibbs_Distributions_and_the_Bayesian_Resoration_of_Images","229058449_Nonnegative_image_reconstruction_from_sparse_Fourier_data_A_new_deconvolution_algorithm","228982762_A_limited_memory_steepest_descent_method","224567393_Fast_Gradient-Based_Algorithms_for_Constrained_Total_Variation_Image_Denoising_and_Deblurring_Problems","222545898_Accelerating_gradient_projection_methods_for_-constrained_signal_recovery_by_steplength_selection_rules","220589055_A_Coordinate_Gradient_Descent_Method_for_Nonsmooth_Separable_Minimization","23948415_Smooth_minimization_of_non-smooth_functions"]}
