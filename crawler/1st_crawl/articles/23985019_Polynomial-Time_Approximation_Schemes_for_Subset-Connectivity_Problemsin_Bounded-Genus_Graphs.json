{"id":"23985019_Polynomial-Time_Approximation_Schemes_for_Subset-Connectivity_Problemsin_Bounded-Genus_Graphs","abstract":"We present the first polynomial-time approximation schemes (PTASes) for the\nfollowing subset-connectivity problems in edge-weighted graphs of bounded\ngenus: Steiner tree, low-connectivity survivable-network design, and subset\nTSP. The schemes run in O(n log n) time for graphs embedded on both orientable\nand non-orientable surfaces. This work generalizes the PTAS frameworks of\nBorradaile, Klein, and Mathieu from planar graphs to bounded-genus graphs: any\nfuture problems shown to admit the required structure theorem for planar graphs\nwill similarly extend to bounded-genus graphs.","authors":["Glencora Borradaile","Erik D.
