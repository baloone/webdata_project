{"id":"282294233_Integrating_Dynamic_Walking_and_Arm_Impedance_Control_for_Cooperative_Transportation","abstract":"This paper presents a method for integrating a\ncooperative manipulation task in the design of dynamic walking\nmotions for an underactuated bipedal robot. Applications that\ninvolve physical interaction between a walking biped and\na leading human (or robot) collaborator, require that the\nbiped exhibits compliance at the port of interaction with the\ncollaborator, while at the same time be capable of adjusting its\nstepping pattern in response to the interaction forces developed.\nTo achieve these objectives, the proposed method combines\nimpedance control of the biped’s arm with position control of\nits legs in a way that the closed-loop system adapts its stepping\npattern in accordance with the collaborator’s intentions. The\nmethod is applied in the case of a bipedal robot model walking\nover flat ground and up and down stairs of known geometry\nunder the influence of a trajectory that is unknown to the biped\nand represents the intention of a collaborator.","authors":["Mohamad Shafiee Motahar","Sushant Veer","Ioannis Poulakakis"],"meta":["September 2015","DOI:10.1109/IROS.2015.7353493","Conference: IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and SystemsAt: Hamburg, Germany"],"references":["282294215_On_the_Adaptation_of_Dynamic_Walking_to_Persistent_External_Forcing_using_Hybrid_Zero_Dynamics_Control","264825231_Robust_Policies_via_Meshing_for_Metastable_Rough_Terrain_Walking","254058347_Stabilization_of_Periodic_Orbits_for_Planar_Walking_With_Noninstantaneous_Double-Support_Phase","329235835_Feedback_Control_of_Dynamic_Bipedal_Robot_Locomotion","289702724_Towards_the_Unification_of_Locomotion_and_Manipulation_through_Control_Lyapunov_Functions_and_Quadratic_Programs","274497768_The_effects_of_foot_geometric_properties_on_the_gait_of_planar_bipeds_walking_under_HZD-based_control","270766139_Human-Inspired_Control_of_Bipedal_Walking_Robots","267107523_Motion_Planning_for_Humanoid_Robots","265282748_Feedback_Control_of_Dynamic_Bipedal_Robot_Locomotion","245396860_Investigation_of_the_Impedance_Characteristic_of_Human_Arm_for_Development_of_Robots_to_Cooperate_with_Humans","224156435_Biomimetic_motor_behavior_for_simultaneous_adaptation_of_force_impedance_and_trajectory_in_interaction_tasks","245372490_Impedance_Control_An_Approach_to_Manipulation_Part_III-Applications","241376064_Impedance_control_-_An_approach_to_manipulation_I_-_Theory_II_-_Implementation_III_-_Applications","228917537_Motion_Learning_and_Adaptive_Impedance_for_Robot_Control_during_Physical_Interaction_with_Humans","224272636_A_singular_perturbation_approach_to_modeling_and_control_of_manipulators_constrained_by_a_stiff_environment"]}
