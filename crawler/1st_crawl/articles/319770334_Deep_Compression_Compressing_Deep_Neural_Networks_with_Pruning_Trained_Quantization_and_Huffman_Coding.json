{"id":"319770334_Deep_Compression_Compressing_Deep_Neural_Networks_with_Pruning_Trained_Quantization_and_Huffman_Coding","abstract":"Neural networks are both computationally intensive and memory intensive, making them difficult to deploy on embedded systems with limited hardware resources. To address this limitation, We introduce a three stage pipeline: pruning, quantization and Huffman encoding, that work together to reduce the storage requirement of neural networks by 35x to 49x without affecting their accuracy. Our method first prunes the network by learning only the important connections. Next, we quantize the weights to enforce weight sharing, finally, we apply Huffman encoding. After the first two steps we retrain the network to fine tune the remaining connections and the quantized centroids. Pruning, reduces the number of connections by 9x to 13x; Quantization then reduces the number of bits that represent each connection from 32 to 5. On the ImageNet dataset, our method reduced the storage required by AlexNet by 35x from 240MB to 6.9MB, without loss of accuracy. Our method reduced the size of VGG16 by 49x from 552MB to 11.3MB, again with no loss of accuracy. This allows fitting the model into on-chip SRAM cache rather than off-chip DRAM memory, which has 180x less access energy.","authors":["Song Han","Huizi Mao","William J.
