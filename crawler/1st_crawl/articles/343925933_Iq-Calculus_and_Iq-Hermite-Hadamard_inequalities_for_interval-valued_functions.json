{"id":"343925933_Iq-Calculus_and_Iq-Hermite-Hadamard_inequalities_for_interval-valued_functions","abstract":"Abstract In this paper, we introduce the Iq-derivative and Iq-integral for interval-valued functions and give their basic properties. As a promotion of q-Hermiteâ€“Hadamard inequalities, we also give the Iq-Hermite-Hadamard inequalities for interval-valued functions. At the same time, we give some examples to illustrate the results.","authors":["Tianyi Lou","Ye Guoju","Dafang Zhao","Wei Liu"],"meta":["August 2020Advances in Difference Equations 2020(1)","DOI:10.1186/s13662-020-02902-8"],"references":["336387718_Quantum_Hermite-Hadamard_inequalities_for_double_integral_and_q-differentiable_convex_functions","328793573_New_Jensen_and_Hermite-Hadamard_type_inequalities_for_h-convex_interval-valued_functions","324682853_Opial-type_inequalities_for_interval-valued_functions","313470223_Jensen's_inequality_type_integral_for_fuzzy-interval-valued_functions","308912178_q-Hermite_Hadamard_inequalities_and_quantum_estimates_for_midpoint_type_inequalities_via_convex_and_quasi-convex_functions","332516838_Algebra_of_generalized_Hukuhara_differentiable_interval-valued_functions_review_and_new_properties","317847460_Universitext","315853051_Quantum_Integral_Inequalities_for_Generalized_Convex_Functions","310757247_Some_integral_inequalities_for_interval-valued_functions","308974549_Solving_interval-valued_fractional_initial_value_problems_under_Caputo_gH-fractional_differentiability"]}
