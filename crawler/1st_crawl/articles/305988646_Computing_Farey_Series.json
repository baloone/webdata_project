{"id":"305988646_Computing_Farey_Series","abstract":"The Farey series of order n , F n , consists of all the fractions between 0 and 1 (inclusive) with denominators less than or equal to n , arranged in order of magnitude and expressed in their lowest terms, so that for example The most obvious way of computing one is to assign a long series of stores and then insert the terms with denominator 1, with denominator 2, â€¦ , shifting the terms already there to make room for the new ones in their correct positions. This may require a large amount of storage and is fairly slow because of the large amount of shifting involved: for instance F 1025 has 319765 terms, and occupies 400 printed pages (see Neville [1]). Neville also gives a table related to F 100 , which has 3045 terms. His procedures, a heroic application of pencil-and-paper methods, are described at the end of this paper.","authors":["Norman Routledge"],"meta":["March 2008The Mathematical Gazette 92(523):55-62","DOI:10.1017/S002555720018252X"],"references":["324349043_The_Farey_Series_of_Order_1025","270310911_The_Higher_Arithmetic","221451704_Computing_Order_Statistics_in_the_Farey_Sequence","220694260_An_Introduction_to_Theory_of_Numbers","31100562_The_Structure_of_Farey_Series"]}
