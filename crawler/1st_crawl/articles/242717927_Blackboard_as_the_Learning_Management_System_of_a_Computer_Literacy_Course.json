{"id":"242717927_Blackboard_as_the_Learning_Management_System_of_a_Computer_Literacy_Course","abstract":"This study reports the evaluation results of using a learning management system (LMS) in a computer literacy course. The goal of the present study was to explore the usefulness of content delivery and how it helped students in learning computing skills. Using Blackboard as the LMS, 145 undergraduate college students enrolled in a computer literacy course in a large southwestern university responded to an online survey and seven instructors who taught the course were surveyed over email to determine value and usefulness of the features in the environment. Overall, assignments, course documents and gradebook were reported as the most useful features. Immediate feedback on quizzes, accessing the materials at all times, and getting comfortable in use of technology were rated as most helpful areas. Both students and instructors responded positively to the LMS experience and provided evidence that numerous learning outcomes can be enhanced by the presence of such a system.","authors":["Florence Martin"],"meta":["January 2008"],"references":["291333688_New_Literacies_Changing_Knowledge_and_Classroom_Learning","274670475_Development_of_a_Standardized_Test_of_Computer_Literacy_and_a_Computer_Anxiety_Index","247747589_Technological_and_Structural_Characteristics_Student_Learning_and_Satisfaction_with_Web-Based_Courses_An_Exploratory_Study_of_Two_On-Line_MBA_Programs","284696333_Student_perceptions_of_online_versus_on_campus_instruction","275514391_Advancing_Excellence_in_Technological_Literacy","264407459_The_Impact_of_ICT_on_Literacy_Education","262142507_How_Information_Gives_You_Competitive_Advantage","252493713_Using_Blackboard_in_an_Educational_Psychology_Course_to_Increase_Pre_service_Teachers'_Skills_and_Confidence_in_Technology_Integration","245507810_Assessing_Learning_Management_Systems","242484469_How_undergraduates_learn_computer_skills_results_of_a_survey_and_focus_group"]}
