{"id":"309184514_Migration_of_the_Individuals","abstract":"The individuals are modeled by the elements of variable domains. The primitive frame to detect the individual migration from domain to domain is proposed. The supporting computational model is based on a separation of individuals into actual, possible and virtual ones. As was shown, this leads to an adoption of the stage-by-stage cognition model with a pair of evolvents to capture dynamics of the domains â€“ the 2-dimensions model. The first evolvent reflects the generation of the individuals in a domain, the beginning of and canceling out their existence in a domain. The second evolvent reflects the shifts in properties of the individuals. As awaited this unified data model will have the applications to a wide range of models in computer science and Information Technologies.","authors":["Viacheslav Wolfengagen","Larisa Yu.
