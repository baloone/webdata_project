{"id":"343252083_Evolutionary_reinforcement_learning_of_dynamical_large_deviations","abstract":"We show how to bound and calculate the likelihood of dynamical large deviations using evolutionary reinforcement learning. An agent, a stochastic model, propagates a continuous-time Monte Carlo trajectory and receives a reward conditioned upon the values of certain path-extensive quantities. Evolution produces progressively fitter agents, potentially allowing the calculation of a piece of a large-deviation rate function for a particular model and path-extensive quantity. For models with small state spaces, the evolutionary process acts directly on rates, and for models with large state spaces, the process acts on the weights of a neural network that parameterizes the modelâ€™s rates. This approach shows how path-extensive physics problems can be considered within a framework widely used in machine learning.","authors":["Stephen Whitelam","Daniel Jacobson","Isaac Tamblyn"],"meta":["July 2020The Journal of Chemical Physics 153(4):044113","DOI:10.1063/5.0015301"],"references":["341580780_A_deep_learning_functional_estimator_of_optimal_dynamics_for_sampling_large_deviations","334152566_Identifying_quantum_phase_transitions_using_artificial_neural_networks_on_experimental_data","325163183_Density_anomaly_of_water_at_negative_pressures_from_first_principles","324104576_Adaptive_Sampling_of_Large_Deviations","324101624_SchNet_-_A_deep_learning_architecture_for_molecules_and_materials","323140606_Editor's_Pick_Constructing_first-principles_phase_diagrams_of_amorphous_LixSi_using_machine-learning-assisted_sampling_with_an_evolutionary_algorithm","321160645_The_TensorMol-01_Model_Chemistry_a_Neural_Network_Augmented_with_Long-Range_Physics","320473480_Mastering_the_game_of_Go_without_human_knowledge","313397533_Deep_learning_and_the_Schrodinger_equation","311306736_Quantum-Chemical_Insights_from_Deep_Tensor_Neural_Networks","292189463_Adaptive_Importance_Sampling_for_Control_and_Inference","292074166_Mastering_the_game_of_Go_with_deep_neural_networks_and_tree_search","277335128_Activity_driven_fluctuations_in_living_cells","232063194_Large_deviations_of_the_empirical_flow_for_continuous_time_Markov_chains","231155793_Canonical_structure_of_dynamical_fluctuations_in_mesoscopic_nonequilibrium_steady_states","229328831_The_Arcade_Learning_Environment_An_Evaluation_Platform_for_General_Agents","227446046_Importance_Sampling_for_Stochastic_Simulations","220344150_Technical_Note_Q-Learning","220244079_Adaptive_Importance_Sampling_Technique_for_Markov_Chains_Using_Stochastic_Approximation","341307320_Learning_to_grow_Control_of_material_self-assembly_using_evolutionary_reinforcement_learning","337202721_Using_Matrix_Product_States_to_Study_the_Dynamical_Large_Deviations_of_Kinetically_Constrained_Models","333059809_Direct_evaluation_of_dynamical_large-deviation_rate_functions_using_a_variational_ansatz","331078371_Crawling_in_Rogue's_Dungeons_with_Partitioned_A3C_4th_International_Conference_LOD_2018_Volterra_Italy_September_13-16_2018_Revised_Selected_Papers","330629990_Library-Based_LAMMPS_Implementation_of_High-Dimensional_Neural_Network_Potentials","329411785_Policy-guided_Monte_Carlo_Reinforcement-learning_Markov_chain_dynamics","326666314_A_new_approach_for_the_prediction_of_partition_functions_using_machine_learning_techniques","325065025_Machine_learning_and_molecular_design_of_self-assembling_-conjugated_oligopeptides","324762293_Machine_learning_and_data_science_in_materials_design_a_themed_collection","324378294_Large_Deviation_Techniques_in_Decision_Simulation_and_Estimation","319415715_Exact_Fluctuations_of_Nonequilibrium_Steady_States_from_Approximate_Auxiliary_Dynamics","312043049_Simple_bounds_on_fluctuations_and_uncertainty_relations_for_first-passage_times_of_counting_observables","310953349_Finite-size_scaling_of_a_first-order_dynamical_phase_transition_adaptive_population_dynamics_and_effective_model","310596263_Sampling_algorithms_for_validation_of_supervised_learning_models_for_Ising-like_systems","302377136_Machine_learning_phases_of_matter","286301598_Dissipation_Bounds_All_Steady-State_Current_Fluctuations","285648123_Universal_bounds_on_current_fluctuations","278733852_Variational_and_optimal_control_representations_of_conditioned_and_driven_processes","272837232_Human-level_control_through_deep_reinforcement_learning","265831260_Monte_Carlo_Simulation_and_Large_Deviations_Theory_for_Uniformly_Recurrent_Markov_Chains","265815481_An_Introduction_to_Rare_Event_Simulation","265727384_Stochastic_Simulation_Algorithms_and_Analysis","259022192_Genetic_Algorithms","258961516_Introduction_Theory_and_Technical''_Aspects_of_Monte_Carlo_Simulations","258091263_Kinetic_Ising_Model_of_the_Glass_Transition","257196294_A_basic_formula_for_performance_gradient_estimation_of_semi-Markov_decision_processes","251463777_Chapter_11_Rare-Event_Simulation_Techniques_An_Introduction_and_Recent_Advances","232144214_Large_deviation_function_for_the_entropy_production_Optimal_trajectoryand_role_of_fluctuations","231148712_First-order_dynamical_phase_transition_in_models_of_glasses_An_approach_based_on_ensembles_of_histories","224043664_Exact_Stochastic_Simulation_Of_Coupled_Chemical-Reactions","221112483_Neural_Fitted_Q_Iteration_-_First_Experiences_with_a_Data_Efficient_Neural_Reinforcement_Learning_Method"]}
