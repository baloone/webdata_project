{"id":"251384029_Time_Reversal_with_MISO_for_Ultra-Wideband_Communications_Experimental_Results_invited_paper","abstract":"Time reversal (TR) communications marks a paradigm shift in UWB communications. The system complexity can be shifted from the receiver to the transmitter, which is ideal to UWB sensors. UWB Multiple Input Single Output (MISO) is enabled by the use of the TR scheme. Two basic problems are investigated experimentally using short UWB radio pulses (nanosecond duration). Temporal focusing and SNR increase with the number of antennas are verified. Also, reciprocity of realistic channels, the foundation of TR, is demonstrated for the first time in electromagnetics.","authors":["Robert C. Qiu","Terry Guo","John Q.
