Industryâ€™s pair programming methodology has been adopted in the recent years as a form of collaborative learning in academic settings. This study reviews the existing body of research aiming two achieve two objectives. First, analyze adoption of pair programming as a pedagogical method using theories based on team learning research. The team effectiveness model was adapted as a framework for analysis, focusing on the outcomes such as facilitation of student learning and fostering of team skills. Second, this study aims to inform information system educators about the viability of using this technique in programming courses.","authors":["Silvana Faja"],"meta":["January 2011"],"references":["247935033_IS_2010_Curriculum_Guidelines_for_Undergraduate_Degree_Programs_in_Information_Systems","234787563_Assessing_the_effectiveness_of_distributed_pair_programming_for_an_online_informatics_curriculum","232930749_The_effect_of_incorporating_cooperative_learning_principles_in_pair_programming_for_student_teachers","317953561_Mind_in_society_The_development_of_higher_psychological_processes","275619084_Attitudes_on_Using_Pair-Programming","246662913_Leadership_Enhancing_The_Lessons_of_Experiences","241739331_Team_Building_in_an_Online_Organizational_Behavior_Course","234831230_Experiences_with_pair_programming_at_a_small_college","234794770_Pair_design_in_undergraduate_labs","234792482_PAIR_programming_as_a_model_of_collaborative_learning_a_review_of_the_research"]}
