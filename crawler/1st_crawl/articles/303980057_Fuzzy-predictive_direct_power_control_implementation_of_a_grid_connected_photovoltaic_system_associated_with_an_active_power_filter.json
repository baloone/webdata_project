{"id":"303980057_Fuzzy-predictive_direct_power_control_implementation_of_a_grid_connected_photovoltaic_system_associated_with_an_active_power_filter","abstract":"The present paper proposes a real time implementation of an optimal operation of a double stage grid connected photovoltaic system, associated with a shunt active power filter. On the photovoltaic side, a fuzzy logic based maximum power point taking control is proposed to track permanently the optimum point through an adequate tuning of a boost converter regardless the solar irradiance variations; whereas, on the grid side, a model predictive direct power control is applied, to ensure both supplying a part of the load demand with the extracted photovoltaic power, and a compensation of undesirable harmonic contents of the grid current, under a unity power factor operation. The implementation of the control strategies is conducted on a small scale photovoltaic system, controlled via a dSPACE 1104 single card. The obtained experimental results show on one hand, that the proposed Fuzzy logic based maximum power taking point technique provides fast and high performances under different irradiance levels while compared with a sliding mode control, and ensures 1.57% more in efficiency. On the other hand, the predictive power control ensures a flexible settlement of active power amounts exchanges with the grid, under a unity power functioning. Furthermore, the grid current presents a sinusoidal shape with a tolerable total harmonic distortion coefficient 4.71%.","authors":["Sabir Ouchen","Achour Betka","Sabrina Abdeddaim","Abdelkrim Menadi"],"meta":["August 2016Energy Conversion and Management 122:515-525","DOI:10.1016/j.enconman.2016.06.018","Project: active filtering of a photovoltaic system connected to the network"],"references":["289521807_A_new_Golden_Section_method-based_maximum_power_point_tracking_algorithm_for_photovoltaic_systems","289379297_Global_Maximum_Power_Point_Tracking_GMPPT_of_Photovoltaic_array_using_the_Extremum_Seeking_Control_ESC_A_review_and_a_new_GMPPT_ESC_scheme","286625394_Global_Extremum_Seeking_Control_of_the_Power_Generated_by_a_Photovoltaic_Array_under_Partially_Shaded_Conditions","277076678_Real_Time_Implementation_of_A_Fuzzy_Logic_Based_Mppt_Controller_for_Grid_Connected_Photovoltaic_System","272381304_Design_and_simulation_of_a_solar_supplied_multifunctional_active_power_filter_and_a_comparative_study_on_the_current-detection_algorithms","271845740_A_PSO-based_global_MPPT_technique_for_distributed_PV_power_generation","270935277_Active_and_reactive_power_ripple_minimization_in_direct_power_control_of_matrix_converter-fed_DFIG","269279453_A_comprehensive_comparison_of_different_MPPT_techniques_for_photovoltaic_systems","259658522_Fuzzy_Logic_Controller_Based_SEPIC_Converter_for_Maximum_Power_Point_Tracking","290480705_An_adaptive_control_algorithm_for_grid-interfacing_inverters_in_renewable_energy_based_distributed_generation_systems","282984547_Artificial_neural_networks_controller_for_power_system_voltage_improvement","280297471_Renewable_energy_based_off-grid_rural_electrification_in_Uttarakhand_state_of_India_Technology_options_modelling_method_barriers_and_recommendations","278055331_Predictive_direct_power_control_for_photovoltaic_grid_connected_system_An_approach_based_on_multilevel_converters","277474786_Review_of_recent_trends_in_optimization_techniques_for_solar_photovoltaic-wind_based_hybrid_energy_systems","276159389_Maximum_power_point_tracking_for_PV_systems_under_partial_shading_conditions_using_current_sweeping","265852978_A_review_of_maximum_power_point_tracking_techniques_for_use_in_partially_shaded_conditions","260712838_TABLE-BASED_direct_power_control_for_three-level_neutral_point-clamped_pulse-width_modulated_rectifier","260619418_Evaluation_of_the_Hill_Climbing_and_the_Incremental_Conductance_Maximum_Power_Point_Trackers_for_Photovoltaic_Power_Systems","260082762_A_New_Quick_Response_and_High_Efficiency_Control_Strategy_for_the_Induction_Motor","260008319_The_performance_of_perturb_and_observe_and_incremental_conductance_maximum_power_point_tracking_method_under_dynamic_weather_conditions","256854283_Comparison_Between_Conventional_Methods_and_GA_Approach_for_Maximum_Power_Point_Tracking_of_Shaded_Solar_PV_Generators","254015888_Direct_Power_Control_of_a_Three-Phase_Rectifier_Based_on_Positive_Sequence_Detection","253091272_Predictive_direct_power_control_of_three-phase_boost_rectifier","229375823_Power_Quality_Improvement_Using_DPC_Controlled_Three-Phase_Shunt_Active_Filter","224371082_An_Adaptive_Controller_for_the_Shunt_Active_Filter_Considering_a_Dynamic_Load_and_the_Line_Impedance","224178570_Single-phase_single-stage_grid-interactive_photovoltaic_system_with_active_filter_functions","223387063_Design_and_Implementation_of_Predictive_Current_Control_of_Three-Phase_PWM_Rectifier_Using_Space-Vector_Modulation_SVM","222517465_Optimization_of_a_photovoltaic_pumping_system_based_on_the_optimal_control_theory","3976655_A_three-phase_PWM_rectifier_with_active_filtering_function"]}
