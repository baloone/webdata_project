{"id":"354257051_Artificial_Intelligence_Machine_Learning_and_Deep_Learning_in_Ion_Channel_Bioinformatics","abstract":"Ion channels are linked to important cellular processes. For more than half a century, we have been learning various structural and functional aspects of ion channels using biological, physiological, biochemical, and biophysical principles and techniques. In recent days, bioinformaticians and biophysicists having the necessary expertise and interests in computer science techniques including versatile algorithms have started covering a multitude of physiological aspects including especially evolution, mutations, and genomics of functional channels and channel subunits. In these focused research areas, the use of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) algorithms and associated models have been found very popular. With the help of available articles and information, this review provide an introduction to this novel research trend. Ion channel understanding is usually made considering the structural and functional perspectives, gating mechanisms, transport properties, channel protein mutations, etc. Focused research on ion channels and related findings over many decades accumulated huge data which may be utilized in a specialized scientific manner to fast conclude pinpointed aspects of channels. AI, ML, and DL techniques and models may appear as helping tools. This review aims at explaining the ways we may use the bioinformatics techniques and thus draw a few lines across the avenue to let the ion channel features appear clearer.","authors":["Md Ashrafuzzaman"],"meta":["August 2021Membranes 11(9):672","DOI:10.3390/membranes11090672"],"references":["352567506_Application_of_Machine_Learning_for_Drug-Target_Interaction_Prediction","339578120_An_Introductory_Review_of_Deep_Learning_for_Prediction_Models_With_Big_Data","339384694_Extremely-randomized-tree-based_Prediction_of_N6-Methyladenosine_Sites_in_Saccharomyces_cerevisiae","338626934_Dataset_on_interactions_of_membrane_active_agents_with_lipid_bilayers","338426529_Deep-Channel_uses_deep_neural_networks_to_detect_single-molecule_events_from_patch-clamp_data","335144720_Protein_secondary_structure_prediction_using_neural_networks_and_deep_learning_A_review","332857177_Predicting_Ion_Channels_Genes_and_Their_Types_With_Machine_Learning_Techniques","343540180_ICarPS_A_computational_tool_for_identifying_protein_carbonylation_sites_by_novel_encoded_features","339434971_Mutational_scanning_reveals_the_determinants_of_protein_insertion_and_association_energetics_in_the_plasma_membrane","337584812_Charge-based_interactions_of_antimicrobial_peptides_and_general_drugs_with_lipid_bilayers","331990088_Recent_Advances_of_Deep_Learning_in_Bioinformatics_and_Computational_Biology","331043352_k-Skip-n-Gram-RF_A_Random_Forest_Based_Method_for_Alzheimer's_Disease_Protein_Identification","323070498_A_Novel_Computational_Method_for_Detecting_DNA_Methylation_Sites_with_DNA_Sequence_Information_and_Physicochemical_Properties","331865967_DeepIon_Deep_learning_approach_for_classifying_ion_transporters_and_ion_channels_from_membrane_proteins","327140172_Survey_of_Machine_Learning_Techniques_in_Drug_Discovery"]}
