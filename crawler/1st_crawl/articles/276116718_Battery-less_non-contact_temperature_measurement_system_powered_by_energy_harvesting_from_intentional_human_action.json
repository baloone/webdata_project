{"id":"276116718_Battery-less_non-contact_temperature_measurement_system_powered_by_energy_harvesting_from_intentional_human_action","abstract":"This paper presents a battery-less non-contact temperature measurement system powered by energy harvesting from intentional human action. The conversion between the human action and electrical energy is provided by a hand-crank electromagnetic (EM) converter. The AC voltage generated by the EM converter has time-varying amplitude and frequency and is rectified by a metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor-based voltage doubler active rectifier circuit. The harvested energy is efficiently stored into multiple capacitors by the innovative sequential charging of storage capacitors technique, and used to power a micro electro mechanical system thermopile sensor with related signal conditioning electronics plus a liquid-crystal display to visualise the temperature readings. With a force of about 29.4 N over 2 cm applied to the EM converter, the power management circuit is able to extract an energy of 27.5 mJ and power the non-contact temperature measurement system for about 33 s.","authors":["Davide Alghisi","Vittorio Ferrari","Marco Ferrari"],"meta":["March 2015IET Circuits, Devices and Systems 9(2):96-104","DOI:10.1049/iet-cds.2013.0437"],"references":["271617289_Implementation_of_a_Single_Supply_Pre-biasing_Circuit_for_Piezoelectric_Energy_Harvesters","257723644_A_Compact_Electromagnetic_Vibration_Harvesting_System_with_High_Performance_Interface_Electronics","257723643_Active_rectifier_circuits_with_sequential_charging_of_storage_capacitors_SCSC_for_energy_harvesting_in_autonomous_sensors","257346939_A_new_synchronized_switching_harvesting_scheme_employing_current_doubler_rectifier","251713028_A_New_Rectifier_and_Trigger_Circuit_for_a_Piezoelectric_Microgenerator","241123783_A_Scalable_Micro-power_Converter_for_Multi-Source_Piezoelectric_Energy_Harvesting_Applications","236026416_C_R_Saha_T_O'Donnell_N_Wang_and_P_McCloskey_Electromagnetic_generator_harvesting_energy_from_human_motion_Sensors_and_Actuators_-_A_Physical_volume_147_Issue_1_2008","228780566_An_Autonomous_Battery-Less_Sensor_Module_Powered_by_Piezoelectric_Energy_Harvesting_with_RF_Transmission_of_Multiple_Measurement_Signals","2982651_Fully_integrated_wideband_high-current_rectifiers_for_inductively_powered_devices","290976448_Harvesting_motion_energy","288200288_Voltage_Regulators_for_Next_Generation_Microprocessors","261501685_Autonomous_and_self-starting_efficient_micro_energy_harvesting_interface_with_adaptive_MPPT_buffer_monitoring_and_voltage_stabilization","260585790_Human_Powered_Wireless_Charger_for_Low-Power_Mobile_Electronic_Devices","260509992_Analysis_of_Supercapacitor_Energy_Loss_for_Power_Management_in_Environmentally_Powered_Wireless_Sensor_Nodes","260509493_Ultralow_Power_Fully_Autonomous_Boost_Rectifier_for_Electromagnetic_Energy_Harvesters","257347130_An_electromagnetic_energy_harvesting_system_for_low_frequency_applications_with_a_passive_interface_ASIC_in_standard_CMOS","245189954_Energy_harvesting_State-of-the-art","245081210_Self-powered_circuit_for_broadband_multimodal_piezoelectric_vibration_control","237895853_A_magnetoelectric_energy_harvester_and_management_circuit_for_wireless_sensor_network","226879630_Comparison_between_four_piezoelectric_energy_harvesting_circuits","224250207_Start-up_circuit_with_low_minimum_operating_power_for_microwatt_energy_harvesters","224193951_Investigation_on_Electrical_Output_Combination_Options_in_a_Piezoelectric_Multifrequency_Converter_Array_for_Energy_Harvesting_in_Autonomous_Sensors","224125530_Supercapacitor-based_hybrid_storage_systems_for_energy_harvesting_in_wireless_sensor_networks","222177248_A_comparison_between_several_vibration-powered_piezoelectric_generators_for_standalone_systems","23454091_Double_synchronized_switch_harvesting_DSSH_A_new_energy_harvesting_scheme_for_efficient_energy_extraction","2983155_Piezoelectric_Micro-Power_Generation_Interface_Circuits"]}
