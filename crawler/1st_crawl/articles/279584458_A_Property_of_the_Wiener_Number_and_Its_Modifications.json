{"id":"279584458_A_Property_of_the_Wiener_Number_and_Its_Modifications","abstract":"The Wiener number W of a Cn-alkane is bounded as W(Sn)≤ W≤ W(Pn) where Sn and Pn are the n-vertex star and n-vertex path, respectively. It is shown that analogous bounds hold for various, recently proposed, modifications of the Wiener number (e.g. hyper-Wiener index, Harary number), as well as for a large class of potential vertex-distance-based topological indices.","authors":["I.
