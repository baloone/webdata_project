{"id":"287251347_Tighter_Bounds_on_the_Inefficiency_Ratio_of_Stable_Equilibria_in_Load_Balancing_Games","abstract":"In this paper we study the inefficiency ratio of stable equilibria in load\nbalancing games introduced by Asadpour and Saberi [3]. We prove tighter lower\nand upper bounds of 7/6 and 4/3, respectively. This improves over the best\nknown bounds in problem (19/18 and 3/2, respectively). Equivalently, the\nresults apply to the question of how well the optimum for the $L_2$ -norm can\napproximate the $L_{\\infty}$-norm (makespan) in identical machines scheduling.","authors":["Akaki Mamageishvili","Paolo Penna"],"meta":["December 2015Operations Research Letters 44(5)","DOI:10.1016/j.orl.2016.07.014","SourcearXiv"],"references":["5176381_Selfish_Routing_In_Capacitated_Networks","2932242_The_Price_of_Stability_for_Network_Design_with_Fair_Cost_Allocation","287012375_Worst-case_equilibria_in_Symposium_on_Theoretical_Aspects_of_Computer_Science","283911047_Sequential_scheduling_on_identical_machines","266435524_Algorithmic_game_theory_Foreword_by_Christos_H_Papadimitriou","258222947_Algorithmic_Game_Theory","242638896_Bounds_on_Multiprocessing_Timing_Anomalies","222302283_Worst-Case_Equilibria","221013514_Nash_Equilibria_with_Minimum_Potential_in_Undirected_Broadcast_Games","220853380_On_the_Inefficiency_Ratio_of_Stable_Equilibria_in_Congestion_Games","220223033_Bounds_on_Multiprocessing_Timing_Anomalies","23740336_Population_Games","2314243_Approximation_Schemes_for_Scheduling"]}
