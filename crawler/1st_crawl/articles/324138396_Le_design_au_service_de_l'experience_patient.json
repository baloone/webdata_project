{"id":"324138396_Le_design_au_service_de_l'experience_patient","abstract":"Quebec’s health system faces many challenges with an aging population, declining health resources and social willingness to die with dignity. Therefore, the development of new and more humane healthcare services, where the physical and emotional environment is taken into consideration seems to be needed. However, the processes aiming at improving that experience is not well known and some believe that, through collaborative approaches, design methods would allow to craft more dignified healthcare services. The need to create for and with people in healthcare services can be linked to the ethics of care where the notion of being fair refers to taking care of others. Thus, this article offers a framework to reflect upon the notion of care, but more importantly upon the notion of participation in order to explore the purpose of design in the development of healthcare services.","authors":["Valerie Cote","Lynda Bélanger","Caroline Gagnon"],"meta":["November 2017Sciences du Design 2(6):54-64","DOI:10.3917/sdd.006.0054"],"references":["271217342_Strategic_Re-Design_of_Team-Based_Patient-Focused_Health_Care_Services","221893225_Patient_Engagement-What_Works","51421720_The_Next_Step_in_Guideline_Development_Incorporating_Patient_Preferences","6721356_Experience-Based_Design_From_Redesigning_the_System_Around_the_Patient_to_Co-designing_Services_with_the_Patient","236581258_Effects_of_improved_patient_participation_in_primary_care_on_health-related_outcomes_A_systematic_review","235401499_Patient_And_Family_Engagement_A_Framework_For_Understanding_The_Elements_And_Developing_Interventions_And_Policies","51463479_Using_the_Customer_Service_Framework_to_Successfully_Implement_Patient-_and_Family-Centered_Care","26694658_Empirical_research_on_empathy_in_medicine-A_critical_review"]}
