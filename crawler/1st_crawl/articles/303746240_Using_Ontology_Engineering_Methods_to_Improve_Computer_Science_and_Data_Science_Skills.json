{"id":"303746240_Using_Ontology_Engineering_Methods_to_Improve_Computer_Science_and_Data_Science_Skills","abstract":"This paper focuses on issues of ontology construction process, Computing Classification System and Data Science domain ontology all used to help not only IT-students but any IT-specialists from industry and academia also to tackle the problems addressing the Big Data and Data Science skills gap. We discuss some methodological aspects of ontology design process and enriching of existing free accessible ontologies and show how suggested methods and software tools help IT-specialists including master students to implement their research work and participate in real world projects. The role of visual data exploration tools for certain issues under discussion and some use cases are discussed.","authors":["Svetlana Chuprina","Vassil N.
