{"id":"342404225_Hidden_and_Forbidden_Conceptualising_Dark_Knowledge","abstract":"Purpose\nThe purpose of this paper is to introduce the concept of Dark Knowledge, an epistemology that acknowledges both alternative knowledge and ways of knowing which are cognizant of the moral and ethical positioning of each.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThis is a conceptual paper that uses existing relevant literature to develop the work. The paper uses a four-stage literature search process and draws upon a range of disciplines, including philosophy, computer science and information management, to underpin the evolution of the concept.\n\nFindings\nAs a conceptual paper, no empirical findings are presented. Instead, the paper presents an embryonic model of Dark Knowledge and identifies a number of characteristics, which may be used to explore the concept in more detail.\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nThere is a clear need to develop a body of empirical work, adding to the theoretical perspectives presented in this paper. It is anticipated that this paper will provide one of the cornerstones for future studies in this area.\n\nOriginality/value\nThe paper makes an original contribution to the study of information behaviours, practices and epistemology.","authors":["Simon Burnett","Annemaree Lloyd"],"meta":["June 2020Journal of Documentation ahead-of-print(ahead-of-print)","DOI:10.1108/JD-12-2019-0234","Project: Dark Knowledge"],"references":["329070148_Hidden_knowledge_Hidden_Powers_Esotericism_and_Conspiracy_Culture","319383049_Defining_Fake_News_A_typology_of_scholarly_definitions","288620557_Beyond_the_Panopticon_Foucault_and_Surveillance_Studies","326566049_Exploring_the_everyday_life_information_needs_and_the_socio-cultural_adaptation_barriers_of_Syrian_refugees_in_Scotland","320213699_Privacy_censorship_data_breaches_and_Internet_freedom_The_drivers_of_support_and_opposition_to_Dark_Web_technologies","319769909_Distilling_the_Knowledge_in_a_Neural_Network","312093993_Researching_fractured_information_landscapes_Implications_for_library_and_information_science_researchers_undertaking_research_with_refugees_and_forced_migration_studies","287404397_Concepts_of_illicit_drug_quality_among_darknet_market_users_Purity_embodied_experience_craft_and_chemical_knowledge","276325935_Forbidden_Knowledge_and_Science_as_Professional_Activity","276318784_Frankensteinian_Knowledge"]}
