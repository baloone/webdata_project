{"id":"349606277_The_Coupling_Effect_of_Lipschitz_Regularization_in_Neural_Networks","abstract":"We investigate the robustness of feed-forward neural networks when input data are subject to random uncertainties. More specifically, we consider regularization of the network by its Lipschitz constant and emphasize its role. We highlight the fact that this regularization is not only a way to control the magnitude of the weights but has also a coupling effect on the network weights across the layers. We claim and show evidence on regression and classification datasets that this coupling effect brings a trade-off between robustness and expressiveness of the network. This suggests that Lipschitz regularization should be carefully implemented so as to maintain coupling across layers.","authors":["Nicolas P.
