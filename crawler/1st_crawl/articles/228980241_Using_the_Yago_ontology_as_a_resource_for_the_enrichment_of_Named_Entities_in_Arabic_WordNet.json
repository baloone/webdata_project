{"id":"228980241_Using_the_Yago_ontology_as_a_resource_for_the_enrichment_of_Named_Entities_in_Arabic_WordNet","abstract":"The development of sophisticated applications in the field of the Arabic Natural Language Processing (ANLP) depends on the availability of resources. In the context of previous works related to the domain of the Arabic Question/Answering (Q/A) systems, a semantic Query Expansion approach using Arabic WordNet (AWN) has been evaluated. The obtained results, al-though AWN (one of the rare resources) has a low coverage of the Arabic language, showed that it helps to improve perform-ances. The evaluation process integrates a Passage Retrieval (PR) system which helps to rank the returned passages according to their structure similarity with the question. In this paper, we investigate the usefulness of enriching AWN by means of the Yago ontology. Preliminary experiments show that this technique helps to extend and improve the processed questions.","authors":["Lahsen Abouenour","Karim Mohamed Bouzoubaa","Paolo Rosso"],"meta":["May 2010","Conference: Workshop on Language Resources and Human Language Technologies for Semitic Languages Status, Updates, and Prospects, LRECâ€™10 ConferenceAt: Malta"],"references":["262252143_Structure-based_evaluation_of_an_Arabic_semantic_query_expansion_using_the_JIRS_passage_retrieval_system","255612700_Arabic_WordNet_and_the_Challenges_of_Arabic","228570257_Three-level_approach_for_Passage_Retrieval_in_Arabic_QuestionAnswering_Systems","228527520_Improving_QA_Using_Arabic_Wordnet","221250660_An_Introduction_to_the_Syntax_and_Content_of_Cyc","290050578_Arabic_WordNet_Current_state_and_future_extensions","230854795_WordNet_-_An_Electronical_Lexical_Database","228737483_Automatically_extending_ne_coverage_of_arabic_wordnet_using_wikipedia","221995866_WordNet_An_Electronic_Lexical_Database","221022804_YAGO_a_core_of_semantic_knowledge"]}
