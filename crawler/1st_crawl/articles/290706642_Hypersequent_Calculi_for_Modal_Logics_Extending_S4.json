{"id":"290706642_Hypersequent_Calculi_for_Modal_Logics_Extending_S4","abstract":"In this paper, we introduce hypersequent calculi for some modal logics extending S4 modal logic. In particular, we uniformly characterize hypersequent calculi for S4, S4.2, S4.3, S5 in terms of what are called “external modal structural rules” for hypersequent calculi. In addition to the monomodal logics, we also introduce simple bimodal logics combing S4 modality with another modality from each of the rest of logics. Using a proof-theoretic method, we prove cut-elimination for the hypersequent calculi for these logics and, as applications of it, we show soundness and faithfulness of Gödel embedding for the monomodal logics and the bimodal logic combining S4 and S5.","authors":["Hidenori Kurokawa"],"meta":["November 2014","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-10061-6_4","Conference: JSAI International Symposium on Artificial Intelligence"],"references":["238507454_Sequent_Systems_for_Modal_Logics","229710050_Logics_With_Several_Modal_Operators","226966284_Cut-free_proof_systems_for_logics_of_weak_excluded_middle","225788229_Proof_Analysis_in_Modal_Logic","222407917_Algebraic_and_proof-theoretic_characterizations_of_truth_stressers_for_MTL_and_its_extensions","31451829_Using_the_Universal_Modality_Gains_and_Questions","2294475_Power_and_Weakness_of_the_Modal_Display_Calculus","279409948_Hypersequent_Calculi_for_Godel_Logics_--_a_Survey","268311537_Displaying_Modal_Logic","267146388_Cut-free_hypersequent_calculus_FOR_S43","266256909_Proof_Methods_for_Modal_and_Intuitionistic_Logic","265667993_Modal_logic_The_Lewis-modal_systems","261157291_From_Frame_Properties_to_Hypersequent_Rules_in_Modal_Logics","239061410_The_method_of_hypersequents_in_the_proof_theory_of_propositional_nonclassical_logics","226620131_Modal_translations_in_substructural_logics","226147705_Quine_and_Slater_on_Paraconsistency_and_Deviance","220810330_Gentzen_Style_Systems_for_K45_and_K45D","220395197_Hypersequent_calculi_for_intuitionistic_logic_with_classical_atoms","220300159_Logical_Constants_as_Punctuation_Marks","220298231_Cut_elimination_for_S4C_A_case_study","38354212_Eine_Darstellung_der_Intuitionistischen_Logik_in_der_Klassischen","2575784_The_Method_Of_Hypersequents_In_The_Proof_Theory_Of_Propositional_Non-Classical_Logics","2245206_Basic_Logic_Reflection_Symmetry_Visibility"]}
