{"id":"325487270_The_Open-Locating-Dominating_Number_of_Some_Convex_Polytopes","abstract":"In this paper we will investigate the problem of finding the open-locating-dominating number for some classes of planar graphs - convex polytopes. We considered Dn , Tn , Bn , Cn , En and Rn classes of\nconvex polytopes known from the literature. The exact values of open-locating-dominating number for Dn and Rn polytopes are presented, along with the upper bounds for Tn , Bn , Cn , and En polytopes.","authors":["Aleksandar Lj.
