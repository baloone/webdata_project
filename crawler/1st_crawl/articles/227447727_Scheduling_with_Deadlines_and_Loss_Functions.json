{"id":"227447727_Scheduling_with_Deadlines_and_Loss_Functions","abstract":"The problem of this paper is that of scheduling several one-stage tasks on several processors, which are capable of handling the tasks with varying degrees of efficiency, to minimize the total loss, which is a sum of losses associated with the individual tasks. Each task has a deadline; the individual loss associated with it is a function of amount of time between the deadline and the time of completion if the former precedes the latter, and zero otherwise.","authors":["Robert McNaughton"],"meta":["October 1959Management Science 6(1):1-12","DOI:10.1287/mnsc.6.1.1","SourceRePEc"],"references":[]}
