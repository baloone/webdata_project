{"id":"318107835_Stabilized_finite_element_methods_for_the_generalized_Oseen_problem","abstract":"The numerical solution of the non-stationary, incompressible Navierâ€“Stokes model can be split into linearized auxiliary problems of Oseen type. We present in a unique way different stabilization techniques of finite element schemes on isotropic meshes. First we describe the state-of-the-art for the classical residual-based SUPG/PSPG method. Then we discuss recent symmetric stabilization techniques which avoid some drawbacks of the classical method. These methods are closely related to the concept of variational multiscale methods which seems to provide a new approach to large eddy simulation. Finally, we give a critical comparison of these methods.","authors":["Malte Braack","Erik Burman","Volker John","Gert Lube"],"meta":["January 2007Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering
