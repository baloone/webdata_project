{"id":"321878591_Superhuman_AI_for_heads-up_no-limit_poker_Libratus_beats_top_professionals","abstract":"No-limit Texas hold’em is the most popular form of poker. Despite AI successes in perfect-information games, the private information and massive game tree have made no-limit poker difficult to tackle. We present Libratus, an AI that, in a 120,000-hand competition, defeated four top human specialist professionals in heads-up no-limit Texas hold’em, the leading benchmark and long-standing challenge problem in imperfect-information game solving. Our game-theoretic approach features application-independent techniques: an algorithm for computing a blueprint for the overall strategy, an algorithm that fleshes out the details of the strategy for subgames that are reached during play, and a self-improver algorithm that fixes potential weaknesses that opponents have identified in the blueprint strategy.","authors":["Noam Brown","Tuomas Sandholm"],"meta":["December 2017Science 359(6374):eaao1733","DOI:10.1126/science.aao1733"],"references":["292074166_Mastering_the_game_of_Go_with_deep_neural_networks_and_tree_search","257479811_First-order_algorithm_with_mathcalOrm_ln1epsilon_convergence_for_epsilon-equilibrium_in_two-person_zero-sum_games","221112399_Bandit_Based_Monte-Carlo_Planning","220442452_Smoothing_Techniques_for_Computing_Nash_Equilibria_of_Sequential_Games","344629991_10_A_SIMPLE_THREE-PERSON_POKER_GAME","312157307_DeepStack_Expert-Level_Artificial_Intelligence_in_No-Limit_Poker","310737796_7_Non-Cooperative_Games","310737795_6_Non-Cooperative_Games","270657171_Computer_science_Heads-up_limit_hold'em_poker_is_solved","235737910_Measuring_the_Size_of_Large_No-Limit_Poker_Games","230873253_Non-Cooperative_Games","228696705_One_Jump_Ahead","228108257_Non-Cooperative_Games","225070191_A_Decision-Theoretic_Generalization_of_On-Line_Learning_and_an_Application_to_Boosting","222544943_Deep_blue","222441562_An_analysis_of_alpha-beta_pruning","222037448_Generalization_learning_techniques_for_automating_the_learning_of_heuristics","220962503_Abstraction_Methods_for_Game_Theoretic_Poker","220133076_Excessive_Gap_Technique_in_Nonsmooth_Convex_Minimization","216301157_Equilibrium_points_in_n-person_games_Proc_Natl_Acad_Sci_USA","29648128_Efficient_Selectivity_and_Backup_Operators_in_Monte-Carlo_Tree_Search","4896390_A_Simple_Adaptive_Procedure_Leading_to_Correlated_Equilibrium","2803045_The_Weighted_Majority_Algorithm"]}
