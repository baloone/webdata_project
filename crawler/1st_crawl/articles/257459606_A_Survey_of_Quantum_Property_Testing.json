{"id":"257459606_A_Survey_of_Quantum_Property_Testing","abstract":"The area of property testing tries to design algorithms that can efficiently\nhandle very large amounts of data: given a large object that either has a\ncertain property or is somehow \"far\" from having that property, a tester should\nefficiently distinguish between these two cases. In this survey we describe\nrecent results obtained for quantum property testing. This area naturally falls\ninto three parts. First, we may consider quantum testers for properties of\nclassical objects. We survey the main examples known where quantum testers can\nbe much (sometimes exponentially) more efficient than classical testers.\nSecond, we may consider classical testers of quantum objects. This is the\nsituation that arises for instance when one is trying to determine if quantum\nstates or operations do what they are supposed to do, based only on classical\ninput-output behavior. Finally, we may also consider quantum testers for\nproperties of quantum objects, such as states or operations. We survey known\nbounds on testing various natural properties, such as whether two states are\nequal, whether a state is separable, whether two operations commute, etc. We\nalso highlight connections to other areas of quantum information theory and\nmention a number of open questions.","authors":["Ashley Montanaro","Ronald de Wolf"],"meta":["October 2013Theory of Computing 2016(1)","DOI:10.4086/toc.gs.2016.007","SourcearXiv"],"references":["280011137_The_nonadaptive_query_complexity_of_testing_k-parities","258083046_Quantum_Locally_Testable_Codes","256117581_Quantum_interactive_proofs_and_the_complexity_of_entanglement_detection","255971869_Optimal_Algorithms_for_Testing_Closeness_of_Discrete_Distributions","253156356_The_Power_of_Unentanglement_Extended_Abstract","242014508_Improved_quantum_test_for_linearity_of_a_Boolean_function","236259510_Entanglement_detection","233764008_Two-Message_Quantum_Interactive_Proofs_and_the_Quantum_Separability_Problem","230868348_The_non-adaptive_query_complexity_of_testing_k-parities","228109500_Proposed_Experiment_to_Test_Local_Hidden-Variable_Theories","226187036_Quantum_Algorithms_for_Learning_and_Testing_Juntas","225751772_Testing_Periodicity","225493680_A_Quantum_Lower_Bound_for_the_Query_Complexity_of_Simon's_Problem","225241368_Maximal_violation_of_Bell's_inequalities_is_generic_in_quantum_field_theory","224934468_Quantum_Tomography_via_Compressed_Sensing_Error_Bounds_SampleComplexity_and_Efficient_Estimators","224266341_Quantum_Query_Complexity_of_State_Conversion","301857732_Quantum_Lower_Bounds_by_Polynomials","262257407_Certifiable_Quantum_Dice_Or_True_Random_Number_Generation_Secure_Against_Quantum_Adversaries","262171028_Guest_Column_The_Quantum_PCP_Conjecture","259940605_Linear_transformations_which_preserve_trace_and_positive_semidefiniteness_of_operators","258555582_Certifiable_Quantum_Dice_-_Or_testable_exponential_randomness_expansion","258239683_The_theory_of_error-correcting_codes_Parts_I_II","255600814_A_Digest_on_Representation_Theory_of_the_Symmetric_Group","253626998_Quantum_Operations_on_Qubitsand_Their_Characterization","252932618_Opening_the_black_box_how_to_estimate_physical_properties_from_non-local_correlations","248503640_Course_notes_Expander_graphs_and_their_applications","247589393_Some_results_and_problems_on_quan-tum_Bell-type_inequalities","243768843_Bounds_for_the_quantity_of_information_transmitted_by_a_quantum_communication_channel","243255771_Which_states_violate_Bell's_inequality_maximally","243152490_Quantum_Limited_State_Discrimination","236338799_Classical_command_of_quantum_systems","235701159_Practical_Characterization_of_Quantum_Devices_without_Tomography","234005110_QMA-complete_problems","232252903_Robust_Self_Testing_of_Unknown_Quantum_Systems_into_Any_Entangled_Two-Qubit_States","232028114_Fully_Device-Independent_Quantum_Key_Distribution","228445032_Optimal_robust_self-testing_by_binary_nonlocal_XOR_games","228109498_Quantum_generalizations_of_Bell's_inequality","228102665_A_Multi-prover_Interactive_Proof_for_NEXP_Sound_against_Entangled_Provers","226104110_Quantum_Detection_and_Estimation_Theory","224905210_Property_Testing_of_Quantum_Measurements","224642482_QMAqpoly_spl_sube_PSPACEpoly_de-Merlinizing_quantum_protocols","222780666_Quantum_Lower_Bounds_by_Quantum_Arguments","222575179_A_lower_bound_for_testing_juntas","222569158_Complexity_measures_and_decision_tree_complexity_A_survey","222535095_Testing_Juntas","221986393_Completely_positive_linear_maps_on_complex_matrices","221700437_Robust_Self_Testing_of_the_Singlet","221591676_Some_Complexity_Questions_Related_to_Distributive_Computing_Preliminary_Report","221591629_Testing_juntas_nearly_optimally","221590995_Efficient_testing_of_groups","221499638_Non-Deterministic_Exponential_Time_Has_Two-Prover_Interactive_Protocols","220778966_Quantum_Property_Testing","221590934_Testing_Symmetric_Properties_of_Distributions","221497828_Property_Testing_A_Learning_Theory_Perspective","220994490_Distinguishing_Short_Quantum_Computations"]}
