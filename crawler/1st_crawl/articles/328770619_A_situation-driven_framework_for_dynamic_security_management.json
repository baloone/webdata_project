{"id":"328770619_A_situation-driven_framework_for_dynamic_security_management","abstract":"We present a dynamic security management framework where security policies are specified according to situations. Situation-based policies easily express complex dynamic security measures, are closer to business, and simplify the policy life cycle management. Situations are specified using complex event processing techniques. The framework is supported by a modular event–based infrastructure where a dedicated situation manager maintains active situations allowing the command center to take dynamic situation–based authorization and obligation decisions. The whole framework has been implemented and showed good performance by simulation. Finally, we detail two real experiments.","authors":["Romain Laborde","Arnaud Oglaza","Ahmad Samer Wazan","François Barrère"],"meta":["November 2018annals of telecommunications - annales des télécommunications 74(10)","DOI:10.1007/s12243-018-0673-0"],"references":["313616838_Guide_to_attribute_based_access_control_ABAC_definition_and_considerations","282314077_CBDAC_Context-Based_Dynamic_Access_Control_Model_Using_Intuitive_5W1H_for_Ubiquitous_Sensor_Network","278790169_From_Ambient_Sensing_to_IoT-based_Context_Computing_An_Open_Framework_for_End_to_End_QoC_Management","275347233_An_Ontological_Framework_for_Situation-Aware_Access_Control_of_Software_Services","262160812_Managing_Break-The-Glass_using_Situation-Oriented_Authorizations","261230882_Authorization_Policies_Using_Decision_Support_System_for_Context-Aware_Protection_of_User's_Private_Data","260750240_Specification_and_Enforcement_of_Dynamic_Authorization_Policies_Oriented_by_Situations","257825953_An_Adaptive_Policy-Based_Framework_for_Network_Services_Management","220473730_Amit_-_The_situation_manager","220141486_Understanding_and_Using_Context","210198488_Design_and_Evaluation_for_Situation_Awareness_Enhancement","3199482_Policy-based_management_of_networked_computing_systems","322201027_dynSMAUG_A_dynamic_security_management_framework_driven_by_situations","313148699_The_situation_underground","313139712_Event-driven_RBAC","291309420_Managing_Risk_and_Information_Security_Protect_to_Enable","262169162_Toward_authorization_as_a_service_a_study_of_the_XACML_standard","232645383_Dynamic_Activation_of_Role_on_RBAC_for_Ubiquitous_Applications","227279341_The_Power_of_Events_An_Introduction_to_Complex_Event_Processing_in_Distributed_Enterprise_Systems","220105803_PERMIS_A_modular_authorization_infrastructure","200827821_RFC_3198_Terminology_for_Policy-Based_Management","4150098_Situation-aware_access_control_for_service-oriented_autonomous_decentralized_systems","3953949_A_multi-domain_security_policy_distribution_architecture_for_dynamic_IP_based_VPN_management"]}
