{"id":"286089393_Mobile_Robotics","abstract":"Mobile Robotics presents the different tools and methods that enable the design of mobile robots; a discipline booming with the emergence of flying drones, underwater mine-detector robots, robot sailboats and robot vacuum cleaners.This book presents the different tools and methods that enable the design of mobile robots. These generally autonomous systems are supervised by a human operator and are able to move in a more or less known environment.Illustrated with simulations, exercises and examples, this book describes the fundamentals of modeling robots, developing the concepts of actuators, sensors, control and guidance. Three-dimensional simulation tools are also explored, as well as the theoretical basis for the reliable localization of robots within their environment.","authors":["Luc Jaulin"],"meta":["November 2015","DOI:10.1002/9781119663546","ISBN: 9781119663546"],"references":[]}
