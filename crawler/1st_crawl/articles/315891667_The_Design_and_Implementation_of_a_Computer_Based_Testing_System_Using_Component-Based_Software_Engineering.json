There is a growing need for educators and stakeholders to explore other means of assessment of students using different medium to help students. Examination is the major and widely accepted use of measuring student ability and understanding of a subject initially taught to him/her. The use of Information and Communication Technology registering and administering examinations helps in attaining efficiency and error-free results and computation. Flexible timing functionality, stand-alone subject module, robustness and scalability are some of the major advantages of the Computer based Test software. The CBT was developed using both the widely accepted Waterfall Model and Reuse-oriented software process models. The whole implementation of the software was achieved using Source Based technologies such as XAMP server, PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, Hypertext Markup Language and Cascading Style Sheet as template design. It provides immediate notification of the student's final score based on what was provided as well as report. It also provides diagrammatic questions as well as mathematical symbols in all subjects. The paper focuses on using Component-Based software model in development of a Computer based Test software, that is, reuse of single core component of the software over and over to develop multiple components of the software. No two component areas (subject) are the same but all (sub-component) follow the template-component.","authors":["Michael Ajinaja"],"meta":["March 2017"],"references":[]}
