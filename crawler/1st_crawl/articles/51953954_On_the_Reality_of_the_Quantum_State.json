{"id":"51953954_On_the_Reality_of_the_Quantum_State","abstract":"Quantum states are the key mathematical objects in quantum theory. It is\ntherefore surprising that physicists have been unable to agree on what a\nquantum state truly represents. One possibility is that a pure quantum state\ncorresponds directly to reality. However, there is a long history of\nsuggestions that a quantum state (even a pure state) represents only knowledge\nor information about some aspect of reality. Here we show that any model in\nwhich a quantum state represents mere information about an underlying physical\nstate of the system, and in which systems that are prepared independently have\nindependent physical states, must make predictions which contradict those of\nquantum theory.","authors":["Matthew F.
