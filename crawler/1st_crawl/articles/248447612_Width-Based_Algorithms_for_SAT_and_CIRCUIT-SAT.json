{"id":"248447612_Width-Based_Algorithms_for_SAT_and_CIRCUIT-SAT","abstract":"We investigate theoretical and practical aspects of algorithms for CIRCUIT-SAT and SAT based on combinatorial parameters.\nTwo such algorithms are given in [1] and [4] based on branch-width of a hypergraph and cut-width of a graph respectively.\nWe give theoretical generalizations and improvements to the cut-width-based algorithm in [4] in terms of many other well-known\nwidth-like parameters. In particular, we have polynomial-time backtrack search algorithms for logarithmic cut-width and path-width,\nn\n\nO(logn)-time backtrack search algorithms for logarithmic tree-width and branch-width, and a polynomial-time regular resolution refutation\nfor logarithmic tree-width. We investigate the effectiveness of the algorithm in [1] on practical instances of CIRCUIT-SAT\narising in the context of Automatic Test Pattern Generation (ATPG).","authors":["Elizabeth Broering","Satyanarayana V.
