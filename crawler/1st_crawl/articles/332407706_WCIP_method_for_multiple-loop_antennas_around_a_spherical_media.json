{"id":"332407706_WCIP_method_for_multiple-loop_antennas_around_a_spherical_media","abstract":"In this paper, the wave concept iterative process (WCIP) method is developed in a spherical coordinate system in\norder to investigate the characteristic of multiple loop antennas around a multilayer sphere. The analysis method is based on the\nincoming and outgoing waves defined from the tangential electromagnetic fields at the interfaces of the layers. The iterative process\nis governed by two systems of equations linking the waves in spectral and spatial domains. The toggling between the two domains\nis insured by the Legendre transformation. Numerical results consider a single and multiple loop (both activated and parasitic\nloops) around a metallic sphere coated by one or several dielectric layers. The mutual coupling and the radiation characteristic\nof a loop excited by two feeding sources is analyzed. The influence of parasitic loops on the return loss of the activated loop is\nextensively investigated including the number and the position of the loops on the sphere. The coupling sensitivity between two\nactivated feeding sources is also investigated. The presented results agree very well with the simulation and the literature.","authors":["Noemen Ammar","Henri Baudrand"],"meta":["April 2019","Project: Regular paper Radiation pattern and scattering parameter for multilayer cylindrical loop antenna using the iterative method WCIP"],"references":["282619411_Wave_Concept_Iterative_Process_Method_for_Electromagnetic_or_Photonic_Jets_Numerical_and_Experimental_Results","260708132_Analysis_of_arbitrary_multiple-loop_antennas_around_a_conducting_cone_with_rotational_symmetry","255572164_Analysis_of_multilayered_cylindrical_structures_using_a_full_wave_method","233852525_Asymptotic_Extraction_Approach_for_Antennas_in_a_Multilayered_Spherical_Media","260722777_Characteristics_of_a_Circular_Loop_Antenna_in_the_Presence_of_a_Coaxial_Conducting_BOR_Attached_to_a_Planar_Reflector","260722050_An_Exact_Series_Representation_for_the_EM_Field_From_a_Circular_Loop_Antenna_on_a_Lossy_Half-Space","260515448_Radiation_from_a_Circular_Loop_Antenna_Placed_Coaxially_Relative_to_a_Conducting_Body_of_Revolution","252486839_The_horizontal_circular_loop_antenna_near_a_planar_interface","252431282_Loop_antennas_for_directive_transmission_into_a_material_half_space","235267504_Antenna_and_EM_modeling_with_Matlab"]}
