{"id":"260357985_K-Means_for_Parallel_Architectures_Using_All-Prefix-Sum_Sorting_and_Updating_Steps","abstract":"We present an implementation of parallel K-means clustering, called Kps-means, that achieves high performance with near-full occupancy compute kernels without imposing limits on the number of dimensions and data points permitted as input, thus combining flexibility with high degrees of parallelism and efficiency. As a key element to performance improvement, we introduce parallel sorting as data preprocessing and updating steps. Our final implementation for Nvidia GPUs achieves speedups of up to 200-fold over CPU reference code and of up to three orders of magnitude when compared with popular numerical software packages.","authors":["Kai J Kohlhoff","Vijay S.
