{"id":"332773325_A_Square_Peg_in_a_Round_Hole_The_Complex_Path_for_Wireless_in_the_Manufacturing_Industry","abstract":"The manufacturing industry is at the edge of the fourth industrial revolution, a paradigm of integrated architectures in which the entire production chain (composed of machines, workers, and products) is intrinsically connected. Wireless technologies can add further value in this manufacturing revolution. However, we identify some signs which indicate that wireless technology could be left out of the next generation of smart factory equipment. This is particularly relevant considering that the heavy machinery characteristic of this sector can last for decades. We argue that at the core of this issue there is a mismatch between industrial needs and the interests of academic and partly academic sectors (e.g., standardization bodies). We base our claims on surveys from renowned advisory firms and interviews with industrial actors, which we contrast with results from content analysis of scientific articles. Finally, we propose some convergence paths that, while still retaining the degree of novelty required for academic purposes, are more aligned with industrial concerns.","authors":["Borja Martinez","Cristina Cano","Xavier Vilajosana"],"meta":["April 2019IEEE Communications Magazine 57(4):109-115","DOI:10.1109/MCOM.2019.1800570"],"references":["325198933_A_Calibrated_Test-Set_for_Measurement_of_Access-Point_Time_Specifications_in_Hybrid_WiredWireless_Industrial_Communication","322418604_The_Wireless_Technology_Landscape_in_the_Manufacturing_Industry_A_Reality_Check","326001070_New_Trends_in_the_Practical_Deployment_of_Industrial_Wireless_From_Noncritical_to_Critical_Use_Cases","316019888_Industrial_Internet_A_Survey_on_the_Enabling_Technologies_Applications_and_Challenges","315509109_Massive_Internet_of_Things_for_Industrial_Applications_Addressing_Wireless_IIoT_Connectivity_Challenges_and_Ecosystem_Fragmentation","315487360_The_Future_of_Industrial_Communication_Automation_Networks_in_the_Era_of_the_Internet_of_Things_and_Industry_40","313420977_The_Internet_of_Things_How_the_Next_Evolution_of_the_Internet_is_Changing_Everything","312450467_Low_Power_Wide_Area_Networks_An_Overview","308274354_Industrial_wireless_communications_over_the_millimeter_wave_spectrum_Opportunities_and_challenges"]}
