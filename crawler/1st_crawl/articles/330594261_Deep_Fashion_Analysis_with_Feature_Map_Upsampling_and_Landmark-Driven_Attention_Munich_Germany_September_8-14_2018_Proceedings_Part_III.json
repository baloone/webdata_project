By utilizing a landmark prediction branch with upsampling network structure, we boost the accuracy of fashion landmark localization. With the aid of the predicted landmarks, a landmark-driven attention mechanism is proposed to help improve the precision of fashion category classification and attribute prediction. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-arts on the DeepFashion dataset.","authors":["Jingyuan Liu","Hong Lu"],"meta":["January 2019","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-11015-4_4","In book: Computer Vision â€“ ECCV 2018 Workshops (pp.30-36)"],"references":["328149464_Attentive_Fashion_Grammar_Network_for_Fashion_Landmark_Detection_and_Clothing_Category_Classification","318981562_Unconstrained_Fashion_Landmark_Detection_via_Hierarchical_Recurrent_Transformer_Networks","271855756_Clothing_Co-Parsing_by_Joint_Image_Segmentation_and_Labeling","243973142_Getting_the_Look_Clothing_Recognition_and_Segmentation_for_Automatic_Product_Suggestions_in_Everyday_Photos","325933705_ABC-CNN_An_attention_based_convolutional_neural_network_for_visual_question_answering","322932501_Unsupervised_Image_Saliency_Detection_with_Gestalt-laws_Guided_Optimization_and_Visual_Attention_Based_Refinement","322649295_Leveraging_Weakly_Annotated_Data_for_Fashion_Image_Retrieval_and_Label_Prediction","320964427_Fully-Adaptive_Feature_Sharing_in_Multi-Task_Networks_with_Applications_in_Person_Attribute_Classification","320543048_Unconstrained_Fashion_Landmark_Detection_via_Hierarchical_Recurrent_Transformer_Networks","320075198_Leveraging_Weakly_Annotated_Data_for_Fashion_Image_Retrieval_and_Label_Prediction","319770268_Joint_Training_of_a_Convolutional_Network_and_a_Graphical_Model_for_Human_Pose_Estimation","318528006_Learning_Fashion_Compatibility_with_Bidirectional_LSTMs","317671418_Learning_and_Recognition_of_Clothing_Genres_From_Full-Body_Images","311610361_DeepFashion_Powering_Robust_Clothes_Recognition_and_Retrieval_with_Rich_Annotations","308278381_Fashion_Landmark_Detection_in_the_Wild","304288340_Content-Based_Filtering_Enhanced_by_Human_Visual_Attention_Applied_to_Clothing_Recommendation","277560717_Cross-Domain_Image_Retrieval_with_a_Dual_Attribute-Aware_Ranking_Network","262411507_Describing_Clothing_by_Semantic_Attributes"]}
