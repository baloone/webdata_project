{"id":"249849213_Dynamic_subset_selection_based_on_a_tness_case_topology_preprint","abstract":"A large training set of tness cases can critically slow down genetic programming, if no appropriate subset selection method is applied. Such a method allows to evaluate an individual on a smaller subset of tness cases. In this paper we suggest a new subset selection method that takes the problem structure into account, while being problem independent at the same time. In order to achieve this, information about the problem structure is acquired during evolutionary search by creating a topology (relationship) on the set of tness cases. The topology is induced by individuals of the evolving population, through increasing the strength of the relation between two tness cases, if an individual of the population is able to solve both of them. Our new topologyñbased subset selection method chooses a subset, such that tness cases in this subset are as little as possible related with respect to the induced topology. We compare topologyñ based selection of tness cases with dynamic subset selection and stochastic subset sampling on four different problems. On average, runs with topologyñbased selection show faster progress than the others.","authors":["Christian W. G. Lasarczyk","Peter Dittrich","Wolfgang Banzhaf"],"meta":[],"references":[]}
