{"id":"271992251_Impact_of_Robotics_and_Geospatial_Technology_Interventions_on_Youth_STEM_Learning_and_Attitudes","abstract":"This study examined the impact of robotics and geospatial technologies interventions on middle school youthâ€™s learning of and attitudes toward science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Two interventions were tested. The first was a 40-hour intensive robotics/GPS/GIS summer camp; the second was a 3-hour event modeled on the camp experiences and intended to provide an introduction to these technologies. Results showed that the longer intervention led to significantly greater learning than a control group not receiving the instruction, whereas the short-term intervention primarily impacted youth attitude and motivation. Although the short-term intervention did not have the learning advantages of a more intensive robotics camp, it can serve a key role in getting youth excited about technology and encouraging them to seek out additional opportunities to explore topics in greater detail, which can result in improved learning.","authors":["Gwen Nugent","Bradley Barker","Neal Grandgenett","Viacheslav I Adamchuk"],"meta":["June 2010Journal of Research on Technology in Education 42(4):391-408","DOI:10.1080/15391523.2010.10782557"],"references":["14751207_Problem-based_learning_A_review_of_literature_on_its_outcomes_and_implementation_issues","311344369_Attidudinal_and_Motitivational_Constructs_in_Science_Learning","271937963_The_Transfer_of_Problem-Solving_Skills_from_a_Problem-Based_Learning_Environment","255567050_Designing_Developing_and_Implementing_a_Course_on_LEGO_Robotics_for_Technology_Teacher_Education","249039319_Using_Technological_Innovation_to_Improve_the_Problem-Solving_Skills_of_Middle_School_Students_Educators'_Experiences_with_the_LEGO_Mindstorms_Robotic_Invention_System","243773514_Computers_as_Mindtools_for_Schools_Engaging_Critical_Thinking","237593293_Rising_Above_The_Gathering_Storm_Energizing_and_Employing_America_for_a_Brighter_Economic_Future","226053277_Problem-Based_Learning_What_and_How_Do_Students_Learn","225933399_A_theory-driven_approach_to_assessing_the_cognitive_effects_of_PBL","220425780_Using_Autonomous_Robotics_to_Teach_Science_and_Engineering","13219176_Variations_on_an_Expectancy-Value_Model_of_Motivation_in_Science"]}
