{"id":"224565399_A_10-Year_Mechatronics_Curriculum_Development_Initiative_Relevance_Content_and_Results-Part_II","abstract":"This paper describes the second and third phases of a comprehensive mechatronics curriculum development effort. They encompass the development of two advanced mechatronics courses (Â¿Simulation and Modeling of Mechatronic SystemsÂ¿ and Â¿Sensors and Actuators for Mechatronic SystemsÂ¿), the formulation of a Mechatronics concentration, and offshoot research activities in the mechatronics area. The first phase involved the design of an Â¿Introduction to MechatronicsÂ¿ course and the infusion of mechatronic activities throughout the curriculum and in outreach activities and has been described in a companion paper Â¿A 10-Year Mechatronics Curriculum Development Initiative: Relevance, Content, and Results-Part IÂ¿ (IEEE Transactions on Education, vol. 53, no. 2, May 2010).","authors":["Mohan Krishnan","Shuvra Das","Sandra A Yost"],"meta":["June 2010IEEE Transactions on Education 53(2):202 - 208","DOI:10.1109/TE.2008.2011542","SourceIEEE Xplore"],"references":["345923749_Advanced_Mechatronics_Development_Of_A_Course_On_Modeling_And_Simulation_Of_Mechatronic_Systems","344547252_Advanced_Mechatronics_Development_Of_A_Course_On_Sensors_Actuators_For_Mechatronic_Systems","276207445_A_Mechatronics_Curriculum_Development_Initiative_Relevance_Content_and_Results_from_an_8-Year_Effort","224565332_A_10-Year_Mechatronics_Curriculum_Development_Initiative_Relevance_Content_and_Results-Part_I","299305488_Who_Owns_Mechatronics","296791230_The_end_of_the_me","276058753_Mechatronic_Modeling_and_Simulation_Using_Bond_Graphs","264949125_Electromechanical_Sensors_and_Actuators","37406679_System_Dynamics_Modeling_and_Simulation_of_Mechatronic_Systems"]}
