{"id":"323857962_Towards_a_Flying_Assistant_Paradigm_the_OTHex","abstract":"This paper presents the OTHex platform for aerial manipulation developed at LAAS–CNRS. The OTHex is probably the first multi-directional thrust platform designed to act as Flying Assistant which can aid human operators and/or Ground Manipulators to move long bars for assembly and maintenance tasks. The work emphasis is on task-driven custom design and experimental validations. The proposed control framework is built around a low-level geometric controller, and includes an external wrench estimator, an admittance filter, and a trajectory generator. This tool gives the system the necessary compliance to resist external force disturbances arising from contact with the surrounding environment or to parameter uncertainties in the load. A set of experiments validates the real-world applicability and robustness of the overall system.","authors":["Nicolas Staub","Davide Bicego","Quentin Sablé","Victor Arellano-Quintana"],"meta":["March 2018","DOI:10.1109/ICRA.2018.8460877","Conference: IEEE 2018 International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)At: Brisbane, Australia","Project: Toward MAGMaS; Multiple Aerial-Ground Manipulator Systems"],"references":["323236348_Omnidirectional_Aerial_Vehicles_with_Unidirectional_Thrusters_Analysis_Optimal_Design_and_Motion_Control","323058771_Aerial_Co-Manipulation_With_Cables_The_Role_of_Internal_Force_for_Equilibria_Stability_and_Passivity","322994718_Control-Aware_Motion_Planning_for_Task-Constrained_Aerial_Manipulation","322945431_Omnidirectional_Aerial_Vehicles_with_Unidirectional_Thrusters_Theory_Optimal_Design_and_Control","318693969_Adaptive_closed-loop_speed_control_of_BLDC_motors_with_applications_to_multi-rotor_aerial_vehicles","318693968_6D_physical_interaction_with_a_fully_actuated_aerial_robot","316786071_Dynamic_Decentralized_Control_for_Protocentric_Aerial_Manipulators","315769256_Dynamic_Collaboration_without_Communication_Vision-Based_Cable-Suspended_Load_Transport_with_Two_Quadrotors","323198649_Full-Pose_Tracking_Control_for_Aerial_Robotic_Systems_With_Laterally_Bounded_Input_Force","319026238_Lightweight_and_human-size_dual_arm_aerial_manipulator"]}
