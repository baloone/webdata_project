{"id":"351053311_Identifying_and_ranking_super_spreaders_in_real_world_complex_networks_without_influence_overlap","abstract":"In the present-days complex networks modeled on real-world data contain millions of nodes and billions of links. Identifying super spreaders in such an extensive network is a challenging task. Super spreaders are the most important or influential nodes in the network that play the central role during an infection spreading or information diffusion process. Depending on the application, either the most influential node needs to be identified, or a set of initial seed nodes are identified that can maximize the collective influence or the total spread in the network. Many centrality measures have been proposed to rank nodes in a complex network such as ’degree’, ’closeness’, ’betweenness’, ’coreness’ or ’k-shell’ centrality, among others. All have some kind of inherent limitations. Mixed degree decomposition or m-shell is an improvement over k-shell that yields better ranking. Many researchers have employed single node identification heuristics to select multiple seed nodes by considering top-k nodes from the ranked list. This approach does not results in the optimal seed nodeset due to the considerable overlap in total spreading influence. Influence overlap occurs when multiple nodes from the seed nodeset influence a specific node, and it is counted multiple times during total collective influence computation. In this paper, we exploit the ’node degree’, ’closeness’ and ’coreness’ among the nodes and propose novel heuristic template to rank the super spreaders in a network. We employ k-shell and m-shell as a coreness measure in two variants for a comparative evaluation. We use a geodesic-based constraint (enforcing a minimum distance between seed nodes) to select an initial seed nodeset from that ranked nodes for influence maximization instead of selecting the top-k nodes naively. All models and metrics are updated to avoid overlapping influence during total spread computation. Experimental simulation with the SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) spreading model and an evaluation with performance metrics like spreadability, monotonicity of ranking, Kendall’s rank correlation on some benchmark real-world networks establish the superiority of the proposed methods and the improved seed node selection technique.","authors":["Giridhar Maji","Animesh Dutta","Mariana
