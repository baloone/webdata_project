{"id":"334147808_The_quantum_Zeno_and_anti-Zeno_effects_from_weak_to_strong_system-environment_coupling","abstract":"By repeatedly measuring a quantum system, the evolution of the system can be slowed down (the quantum Zeno effect) or sped up (the quantum anti-Zeno effect). We study these effects for a single two-level system coupled to a collection of harmonic oscillators. Previously, such systems have been studied in both the weak and the strong system-environment coupling regimes. In this paper, we apply a polaron transformation in a manner that allows us to study the quantum Zeno and anti-Zeno effects for a large variety of system-environment parameters. Using this approach, we reproduce previous results for the weak and strong system-environment coupling regimes. Moreover, as long as the environment is super-Ohmic, we show how our approach can be used to explore regimes such as the moderate system-environment coupling regime that could not be investigated before in a straightforward manner.\n\nGraphical abstract\nOpen image in new window","authors":["Bilal Khalid","Adam Zaman Chaudhry"],"meta":["July 2019The European Physical Journal D 73(7)","DOI:10.1140/epjd/e2019-90681-3"],"references":["328105212_The_quantum_Zeno_and_anti-Zeno_effects_with_non-selective_projective_measurements","320707653_Quantum_Brownian_motion_under_generalized_position_measurements_A_converse_Zeno_scenario","313394640_Analyzing_the_Quantum_Zeno_and_anti-Zeno_effects_using_optimal_projective_measurements","312912517_The_quantum_Zeno_and_anti-Zeno_effects_with_strong_system-environment_coupling","306376487_Stochastic_quantum_Zeno-based_detection_of_noise_correlations","301835475_A_general_framework_for_the_Quantum_Zeno_and_anti-Zeno_effects","287250780_Quantum_Zeno_effect_in_the_strong_measurement_regime_of_circuit_quantum_electrodynamics","282310730_Stochastic_Quantum_Zeno_by_Large_Deviation_Theory","281144785_Quantum_Zeno_and_Zeno-like_effects_in_nitrogen_vacancy_centers","279458634_Quantum_Zeno_effect_in_parameter_estimation","271140642_Fermi_golden_rule_beyond_the_Zeno_regime","261606189_Constrained_Dynamics_via_the_Zeno_Effect_in_Quantum_Simulation_Implementing_Non-Abelian_Lattice_Gauge_Theories_with_Cold_Atoms","260440224_Suppressing_the_Loss_of_Ultracold_Molecules_Via_the_Continuous_Quantum_Zeno_Effect","260313031_Zeno_and_anti-Zeno_effects_on_Dephasing","260022053_Confined_quantum_Zeno_dynamics_of_a_watched_atomic_arrow","259984804_Experimental_realization_of_quantum_Zeno_dynamics","259314280_Criteria_for_the_accuracy_of_small_polaron_quantum_master_equation_in_simulating_excitation_energy_transfer_dynamics","244989677_Role_of_initial_system-environment_correlations_A_master_equation_approach","236664402_Non-Markovianity_during_quantum_Zeno_effect","235570080_Quantum_Zeno_dynamics_of_a_field_in_a_cavity","235516920_Zeno_and_anti-Zeno_effects_in_spin-bath_models","235426843_The_Theory_of_Open_Quantum_Systems","235357758_Experimental_Demonstration_of_Interaction-Free_All-Optical_Switching_via_the_Quantum_Zeno_Effect","234307854_TOPICAL_REVIEW_Quantum_Zeno_dynamics_mathematical_and_physical_aspects","233730493_Amplification_and_suppression_of_system-bath_correlation_effects_in_anopen_many-body_system","51910943_Quantum_Zeno_Subspaces_induced_by_Temperature","46583464_Quantum_dot_Rabi_rotations_beyond_the_weak_exciton-phonon_coupling_regime","45922988_Quantum_Zeno_effect_with_a_superconducting_qubit","45905286_Quantum_anti-Zeno_effect_without_rotating_wave_approximation","45905191_Anti-Zeno_Effect_for_Quantum_Transport_in_Disordered_Systems","45883802_Quantum_Zeno_effect_and_dynamics","23557862_Theory_of_coherent_resonance_energy_transfer","346679833_Quantum_Dissipative_Systems","326338021_Quantum_Zeno_and_anti-Zeno_dynamics_in_a_spin_environment","319163977_Quantum_Zeno_and_anti-Zeno_effects_in_open_quantum_systems","312431730_Quantum_Zeno_and_anti-Zeno_effects_in_quantum_dissipative_systems","275279863_Strongly_Coupled_Quantum_Heat_Machines","258064717_Quantum_Dissipative_System","258064445_The_Zeno's_paradox_in_quantum_theory","236073108_Operator_Quantum_Zeno_Effect_Protecting_Quantum_Information_with_Noisy_Two-Qubit_Interactions","235550434_Quantum_entanglement_via_two-qubit_quantum_Zeno_dynamics","235448098_Quantum_Zeno_and_anti-Zeno_effect_of_a_nanomechanical_resonator_measured_by_a_point_contact","234929645_Variational_calculation_of_the_dynamics_of_a_two_level_system_interacting_with_a_bath","232718437_Zeno_Dynamics_Indistinguishability_of_State_and_Entanglement","230570428_Non-Canonical_Statistics_of_a_Spin-Boson_Model_Theory_and_Exact_Monte-Carlo_Simulations","225271607_Accuracy_of_Second_Order_Perturbation_theory_in_the_Polaron_and_Variational_Polaron_Frames","224853110_Zeno-anti-Zeno_crossover_dynamics_in_a_spin-boson_system","222513636_Quantum_Zeno_dynamics","51821022_Generalized_Polaron_Ansatz_for_the_Ground_State_of_the_Sub-Ohmic_Spin-Boson_Model_An_Analytic_Theory_of_the_Localization_Transition","23710530_Quantum_Zeno_and_Anti-Zeno_Effects_Without_the_Rotating-Wave_Approximation","11198128_Quantum_Zeno_Subspaces","12467264_Acceleration_of_quantum_decay_processes_by_frequent_observations","11879735_Observation_of_the_Quantum_Zeno_and_Anti-Zeno_Effects_in_an_Unstable_System","8538048_Dynamical_Control_of_Macroscopic_Quantum_Tunneling","7567881_Dynamics_of_a_Large_Spin_with_Strong_Dissipation"]}
