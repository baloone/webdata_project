{"id":"312590697_Harnessing_the_Potential_of_Machine_Learning_for_Bioinformatics_using_Big_Data_Tools","abstract":"Advancement in the sequencing technology has resulted in the generation of large amount of bioinformatics data that need to be analyzed in short time. Traditional techniques cannot cope with the speed and size of data generation. New platforms, tools and techniques need to be explored for data analysis that can meet the time and space challenge. Big data tools and techniques address the issues of size, scalability and performance. In this paper, we present the potential of machine learning techniques implemented on Hadoop and Spark for analyzing bioinformatics data. First, we summarize the recent work in this area and then discuss the future research directions and opportunities.","authors":["M.
