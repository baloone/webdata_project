{"id":"328427878_Efficiency_of_a_Three-Particle_Energy_Sink_Experimental_Study_and_Numerical_Simulation","abstract":"The results of an experimental and numerical investigation of the dynamics of a string with three uniformly distributed discrete masses are presented. This system can be used as a resonant energy sink for protecting structural elements from the effects of undesirable dynamic loads over a wide frequency range. Preliminary studies of the nonlinear dynamics of the system under consideration showed its high energy capacity. In this paper, we present the results of an experimental study in which a shaker’s table mounted cantilever beam was being protected. As a result, the efficiency of the sink was confirmed, and data were also obtained to refine the mathematical model. It was shown that the experimental data obtained are in good agreement with the results of computer simulation. © 2018 Institute of Computer Science Izhevsk. All rights reserved.","authors":["S.S.
