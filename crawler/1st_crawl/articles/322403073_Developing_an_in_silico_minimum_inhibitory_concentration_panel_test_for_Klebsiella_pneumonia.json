{"id":"322403073_Developing_an_in_silico_minimum_inhibitory_concentration_panel_test_for_Klebsiella_pneumonia","abstract":"Antimicrobial resistant infections are a serious public health threat worldwide. Whole genome sequencing approaches to rapidly identify pathogens and predict antibiotic resistance phenotypes are becoming more feasible and may offer a way to reduce clinical test turnaround times compared to conventional culture-based methods, and in turn, improve patient outcomes. In this study, we use whole genome sequence data from 1668 clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae to develop a XGBoost-based machine learning model that accurately predicts minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for 20 antibiotics. The overall accuracy of the model, within ±1 two-fold dilution factor, is 92%. Individual accuracies are ≥90% for 15/20 antibiotics. We show that the MICs predicted by the model correlate with known antimicrobial resistance genes. Importantly, the genome-wide approach described in this study offers a way to predict MICs for isolates without knowledge of the underlying gene content. This study shows that machine learning can be used to build a complete in silico MIC prediction panel for K. pneumoniae and provides a framework for building MIC prediction models for other pathogenic bacteria.","authors":["Marcus Nguyen","Thomas Brettin","Scott Wesley Long","James M Musser"],"meta":["January 2018Scientific Reports 8(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-017-18972-w"],"references":["322006141_Discovery_research_and_development_of_new_antibiotics_The_WHO_priority_list_of_antibiotic-resistant_bacteria_and_tuberculosis","320190886_PATRIC_as_a_unique_resource_for_studying_antimicrobial_resistance","318881383_Whole-Genome_Sequencing_of_Human_Clinical_Klebsiella_pneumoniae_Isolates_Reveals_Misidentification_and_Misunderstandings_of_Klebsiella_pneumoniae_Klebsiella_variicola_and_Klebsiella_quasipneumoniae","317334879_Genomics_of_antibiotic-resistance_prediction_in_Pseudomonas_aeruginosa","316991283_Population_Genomic_Analysis_of_1777_Extended-Spectrum_Beta-Lactamase-Producing_Klebsiella_pneumoniae_Isolates_Houston_Texas_Unexpected_Abundance_of_Clonal_Group_307","315359103_Evolution_and_Epidemiology_of_Multidrug-Resistant_Klebsiella_pneumoniae_in_the_United_Kingdom_and_Ireland","312874594_Whole_genome_sequencing_reveals_high-resolution_epidemiological_links_between_clinical_and_environmental_Klebsiella_pneumoniae","312398548_Notes_from_the_Field_Pan-Resistant_New_Delhi_Metallo-Beta-Lactamase-Producing_Klebsiella_pneumoniae_-_Washoe_County_Nevada_2016","317773949_Klebsiella_pneumoniae_A_major_worldwide_source_and_shuttle_for_antibiotic_resistance","315612665_WGS_to_predict_antibiotic_MICs_for_Neisseria_gonorrhoeae","311100167_Evaluation_of_Machine_Learning_and_Rules-Based_Approaches_for_Predicting_Antimicrobial_Resistance_Profiles_in_Gram-negative_Bacilli_from_Whole_Genome_Sequence_Data","310839271_The_Oxford_Nanopore_MinION_Delivery_of_nanopore_sequencing_to_the_genomics_community","309555904_Predictive_computational_phenotyping_and_biomarker_discovery_using_reference-free_genome_comparisons","311348201_Improvements_to_PATRIC_the_all-bacterial_Bioinformatics_Database_and_Analysis_Resource_Center","310824798_XGBoost_A_Scalable_Tree_Boosting_System"]}
