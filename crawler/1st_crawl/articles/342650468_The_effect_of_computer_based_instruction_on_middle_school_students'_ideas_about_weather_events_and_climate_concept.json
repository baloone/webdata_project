The aim of this research is to investigate the effects of computer-based instruction on the concepts of climate and weather events of middle school students. The sample of the research consisted of 19 8th grade students in the experimental group and 23 students in the control group. Computer-based instruction was carried out in the experimental group, and lessons were given in accordance with the middle school science program with the students in the control group. As a data collection tool, a concept test consisting of three open-ended questions was used to determine students' opinions about climate, weather events and the difference between climate and weather events. In the analysis of the data obtained from the answers of the students in the experimental and control groups to open-ended questions before and after the instruction, a rubric consisting of five categories was used. The categories in the rubric are correct answer, incorrect answer, non-coded and no answer categories. According to the findings, it was seen that the scientific responses of the students in both groups increased. Computer-based instruction was found to be more effective in eliminating the misconceptions faced by students about climate, weather events and differences between climate and weather events compared to the courses taught in the program. In the results of the study, it was determined that the students in the experimental and control groups confused the concepts of climate and weather events before instruction and there was a decrease in the misconceptions after instruction. The misconception that climate and weather events were the same was resolved in both groups after instruction. It is suggested that more studies using different instruction methods for teaching these concepts will be conducted.
