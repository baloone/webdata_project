{"id":"305082229_Teaching_High_School_Students_Computational_Thinking_with_Hands-on_Activities","abstract":"In this study we developed three hands-on activities to teach high school students computational thinking (CT) and, specifically, the decomposition skills. The activities were designed to enable students to solve problems by using application tools. The computer science concepts utilized in the activities included binary search, quick sort and iteration. We evaluated the effect of the activities utilizing a post-activity questionnaire, a post-test, students' worksheets, and semi-structured interviews with the participating students. The results indicated that the hands-on activities developed in this study improved students' CT ability.","authors":["Wei-Lin Li","Chiu-Fan Hu","Cheng-Chih Wu"],"meta":["July 2016","DOI:10.1145/2899415.2925496","Conference: the 2016 ACM Conference"],"references":["268789498_Computational_Thinking_in_Life_Science_Education"]}
