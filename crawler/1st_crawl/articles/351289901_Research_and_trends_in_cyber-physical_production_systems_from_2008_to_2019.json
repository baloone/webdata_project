{"id":"351289901_Research_and_trends_in_cyber-physical_production_systems_from_2008_to_2019","abstract":"In recent years, the development of manufacturing, computer science, and automation led to the advance of Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS). This study aims to identify the current state of research on CPPS based on a scoring formula that enables to rank the most influential authors, countries and universities responsible for the most relevant publications. The highly cited papers, the main conferences, journals, and organizations are shown to provide the essential knowledge for scholars and researchers to gain an in-depth understanding of the state-of-the-art of CPPS research and to allow further developments in the field.","authors":["Lucas Caldas Danelon Lopes","Cl√≥vis Neumann"],"meta":["January 2021Procedia CIRP 99:592-597","DOI:10.1016/j.procir.2021.03.113"],"references":["334164216_From_a_literature_review_to_a_conceptual_framework_of_enablers_for_smart_manufacturing_control","283520324_Cyber-physical_production_systems_Roots_from_manufacturing_science_and_technology","276152381_Current_status_and_advancement_of_cyber-physical_systems_in_manufacturing","269709304_A_Cyber-Physical_Systems_architecture_for_Industry_40-based_manufacturing_systems","263857376_Cyber-physical_Production_Systems_Roots_Expectations_and_RD_Challenges","332532655_Production_planning_and_scheduling_in_Cyber-Physical_Production_Systems_a_review","329353960_Research_trends_in_science_education_from_2013_to_2017_a_systematic_content_analysis_of_publications_in_selected_journals","328918853_Reference_architectures_for_smart_manufacturing_A_critical_review","277638343_From_Construction_Megaproject_Management_to_Complex_Project_Management_Bibliographic_Analysis","262147973_Critical_review_of_the_research_on_the_management_of_prefabricated_construction"]}
