{"id":"282836214_Scalable_Alternating_Projection_and_Proximal_Splitting_for_Array_Pattern_Synthesis","abstract":"Array synthesis with embedded element patterns is a problem of great practical importance. In this\npaper, an array pattern synthesis method using scalable alternating projection and proximal splitting is\nproposed which considers the scaling invariance property of design specifications and constraints for\nthe amplitudes of pattern and excitation. Under the framework of alternating projection, the scalable\npattern and excitation constraint sets are first defined. Then the scalable pattern projection and iterative\nprocedure for optimum pattern scaling factor are studied in detail. For the scalable excitation projection,\nit is designed as the solution to a constrained weighted least mean squares optimization, which can be\nsolved by an effective forward-backward splitting iterative process. Finally, the selection of the weighted\nmatrix and computational complexity are discussed briefly. Several typical linear and planar synthesis\nexamples with or without the embedded element patterns are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness\nand power of the proposed method.","authors":["Yubing Han","Chuan Wan"],"meta":["September 2015International Journal of Antennas and Propagation 2015(10):1-13","DOI:10.1155/2015/915293"],"references":["312690325_Proximal_splitting_methods_in_signal_processing","278762029_Signal_recovery_by_proximal_forwardC_backward_splitting","273020990_Array_pattern_synthesis_approach_using_a_genetic_algorithm","272640900_Array_Synthesis_Using_Weighted_Alternating_Projection_and_Proximal_Splitting","268978331_Applied_Iterative_Methods","267180874_Alternating_Projection_Methods","260720885_Linear_Aperiodic_Array_Synthesis_Using_Differential_Evolution_Algorithm","260624326_A_Current_Distribution_of_Broadside_Arrays_which_Optimizes_the_Relationship_between_Beam_Width_and_Sidelobe_Level","260343422_Cosecant-squared_pattern_synthesis_using_a_weighted_alternating_reverse_projection_method","260342665_Conformal_array_pattern_synthesis_using_the_weighted_alternating_reverse_projection_method_considering_mutual_coupling_and_embedded-element_pattern_effects"]}
