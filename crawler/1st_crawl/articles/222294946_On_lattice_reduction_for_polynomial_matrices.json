{"id":"222294946_On_lattice_reduction_for_polynomial_matrices","abstract":"A simple algorithm for lattice reduction of polynomial matrices is described and analysed. The algorithm is adapted and applied to various tasks, including rank profile and determinant computation, transformation to Hermite and Popov canonical form, polynomial linear system solving and short vector computation.","authors":["T.
