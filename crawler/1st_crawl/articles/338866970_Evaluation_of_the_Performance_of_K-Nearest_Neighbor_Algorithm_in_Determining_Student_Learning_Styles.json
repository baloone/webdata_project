ML has the potentials to play a critical role in the future of education. It can assist the teacher to predict student learning patterns and outcomes, and to generate feedbacks on student learning progress. However, research has shown that different machine learning algorithms exist some of which can predict outcomes with high missed classification error. Consequently, the present study evaluates the performance of K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) supervised algorithm in determining students' learning styles. K-NN algorithm is used in the domain of students' learning styles to predict the possible outcomes using various numbers of records in the dataset, ratio of test dataset to training dataset and value of K; in order to minimize the missed classification in other ML algorithms. Data were collected through Felder Silverman Questionnaires administered to 200 respondents selected from the Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology, Bayero University, Kano, Nigeria. The data were analyzed using Felder Silverman classifier to determine the students' learning style and K-NN algorithm to predict the learning style. The findings reveal that the total number of records in the dataset and ratio of test data to training data are significant factors in determining error rate while K value is found to be weakly significant when determining the error rate. Thus, for a large dataset (like 100 records and above), with low ratio (0.25, 0.33 and 1) and small value of k (1, 2 or 3) an error free value for K-NN algorithm was obtained. This implies that K-NN algorithm produces an excellent result for large dataset. Thus, it is the most efficient data mining technique to be used.","authors":["Elhaj Musa","Ali Elnazeerp","Bashir Shehu Galadancip","Hauwa Ahmad Amship"],"meta":["January 2020","Projects: ALL RESEARCHERS WELCOME GLOBAL PLATFORMJournal ArticleEVALUATING THE PERFORMANCE OF THE K-NEAREST NEIGHBOR ALGORITHM IN DETERMINING STUDENTSâ€™ LEARNING STYLES"],"references":["304826093_Application_of_K-nearest_neighbor_KNN_approach_for_predicting_economic_events_theoretical_background","270163293_Application_of_k-Nearest_Neighbour_Classification_in_Medical_Data_Mining","265077377_A_Review_of_various_k-Nearest_Neighbor_Query_Processing_Techniques","263475852_A_comparative_study_of_the_SVM_and_K-nn_machine_learning_algorithms_for_the_diagnosis_of_respiratory_pathologies_using_pulmonary_acoustic_signals","262937142_KNN_based_Machine_Learning_Approach_for_Text_and_Document_Mining","312986214_Some_studies_in_machine_learning_using_the_game_of_checkers","291302522_k-nearest_neighbor_algorithm_for_improving_accuracy_in_clutter_based_location_estimation_of_wireless_nodes","289664261_Support_vector_machine_and_K-_nearest_neighbor_based_analysis_for_the_prediction_of_hypothyroid","283754822_Hierarchical_Reinforcement_Learning_Based_on_KNN_Classification_Algorithms","277906943_BREAST_CANCER_DIAGNOSIS_AND_RECURRENCE_PREDICTION_USING_MACHINE_LEARNING_TECHNIQUES"]}
