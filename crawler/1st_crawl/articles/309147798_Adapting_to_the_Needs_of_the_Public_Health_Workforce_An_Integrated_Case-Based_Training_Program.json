{"id":"309147798_Adapting_to_the_Needs_of_the_Public_Health_Workforce_An_Integrated_Case-Based_Training_Program","abstract":"The goal of any public health education at the Masters level is to transmit knowledge and skills to meet current and future public health challenges. We suggest an innovative multi-modal approach to public health education using a case-based pedagogy combined with competency-based curriculum and a team-based approach to foster truly experiential learning. We describe each pedagogical approach in connection to the relevance of optimal methods for training public health professionals. Western Universityâ€™s Schulich Interfaculty Masters of Public Health (MPH) program (ON, Canada) provides a unique interprofessional education through case-based learning and competency-based curriculum. This Masters program has attracted applicants from around the world to learn in a supportive interprofessional environment and to foster them as they become learners and leaders in public health changes. To our knowledge, we are the first condensed MPH program using integrated case-based pedagogy as our main pedagogical approach.","authors":["Shannon Sibbald","Mark R Speechley","Amardeep Thind"],"meta":["October 2016Frontiers in Public Health 4(1)","DOI:10.3389/fpubh.2016.00221"],"references":["275895134_Success_of_the_Undergraduate_Public_Health_at_Tulane_University","274753287_Ties_Leaders_And_Time_In_Teams_Strong_Inference_About_Network_Structure's_Effects_On_Team_Viability_And_Performance","271193882_Integrated_Teaching_Programme_Using_Case_Based_Learning","265494284_New_Era_for_Schools_and_Programs_of_Public_Health_in_Canada","344058604_Group_Dynamics_for_Teams_6th_Edition","333958211_Problem-based_learning_PBL","327144561_Core_Principles_Values_of_Effective_Team-Based_Health_Care","297545532_Multiprofessional_education_in_undergraduate_curricula_can_work","271751596_Chemists_in_British_Universities_A_Study_of_the_Reward_System_in_Science","260621717_Efficiency_vs_size_of_research_teams"]}
