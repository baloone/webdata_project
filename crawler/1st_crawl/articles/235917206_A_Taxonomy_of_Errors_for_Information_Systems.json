{"id":"235917206_A_Taxonomy_of_Errors_for_Information_Systems","abstract":"We provide a full characterization of computational error states for information systems. The class of errors considered is general enough to include human rational processes, logical reasoning, scientific progress and data processing in some functional programming languages. The aim is to reach a full taxonomy of error states by analysing the recovery and processing of data. We conclude by presenting machine-readable checking and resolve algorithms.","authors":["Giuseppe Primiero"],"meta":["August 2014Minds and Machines 24(3):249-273","DOI:10.1007/s11023-013-9307-5","Project: Philosophy of Computer Science"],"references":["289818763_Error","344577725_Knowledge_and_its_Limits","319395635_The_Description_Logic_Handbook_Theory_Implementation_and_Applications","319393998_Presupposition_and_Assertion_in_dynamic_Semantics","314432235_The_Metaphysics_of_Malfunction","295924956_The_metaphysics_of_malfunction","274434680_Conjectures_and_Refutations","271240431_Philosophy_and_Design_From_Engineering_to_Architecture","271131716_The_Description_Logic_Handbook_Theory_Implementation_and_Applications","270153606_Combinatory_Logic_Volume_I"]}
