{"id":"2448366_Hammersley's_Interacting_Particle_Process_and_Longest_Increasing_Subsequences","abstract":"In a famous paper [8] Hammersley investigated the length Ln of the longest increasing subsequence of a random n-permutation. Implicit in that paper is a certain one-dimensional continuous-space interacting particle process. By studying a hydrodynamical limit for Hammersley's process we show by fairly \"soft\" arguments that limn Gamma1=2 ELn = 2. This is a known result, but previous proofs (Vershik - Kerov [14]; Logan - Shepp [11]) relied on hard analysis of combinatorial asymptotics. Mathematics subject classification. 60C05, 60K35.

(i 2 ) ! : : : (i k ): For instance, the permutation 7 2 8 1 3 4 10 6 9 5 (1) (for which (1) = 4; (2) = 2; ...","authors":["David Aldous","Persi Diaconis"],"meta":["July 1998"],"references":["2270590_On_the_Length_of_the_Longest_Monotone_Subsequence_in_a_Random_Permutation","303284903_Asymptotics_of_the_Plancherel_measure_of_the_symmetric_group_and_the_limiting_form_of_Young_tables","269022841_First-passage_percolation_and_a_higher_dimensional_generalization","247261636_Probability_Theory_and_Examples_2nd_Ed","244470851_Models_of_random_partial_orders","243770699_Asymptotics_of_the_Plancherel_measure_of_the_symmetric_group_and_the_limit_form_of_Young_tableaux","242353101_Group_Representations_in_Probability_and_Statistics","240053444_Interacting_Particle_Systems","239063199_A_few_seedlings_of_research","227030097_Non-equilibrium_behaviour_of_a_many_particle_process_Density_profile_and_local_equilibria","222445529_Shepp_LA_A_variational_problem_for_random_Young_tableaux_Adv_Math26_206-222","38362952_The_Height_of_a_Random_Partial_Order_Concentration_of_Measure","38351708_A_new_look_at_independence","2793095_On_The_Length_Of_The_Longest_Increasing_Subsequence_In_A_Random_Permutation"]}
