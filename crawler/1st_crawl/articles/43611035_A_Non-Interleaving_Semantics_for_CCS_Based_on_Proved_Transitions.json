{"id":"43611035_A_Non-Interleaving_Semantics_for_CCS_Based_on_Proved_Transitions","abstract":"When using labelled transition systems to model languages like CCS or TCSP, one specifies transitions by a set of structural rules. We consider labelling transitions with their proofs – in the given system of rules – instead of simple actions. Then the label of a transition identifies uniquely that transition, and one may use this information to define a concurrency relation on (proved) transitions, and a notion of residual of a (proved) transition by a concurrent one. We apply Berry and Lévy’s notion of equivalence by permutations to sequences of proved transitions for CCS to obtain a partial order semantics for this language.","authors":["Gérard Boudol","Ilaria Castellani"],"meta":["October 1988Fundamenta Informaticae 11(4)","DOI:10.3233/FI-1988-11406"],"references":[]}
