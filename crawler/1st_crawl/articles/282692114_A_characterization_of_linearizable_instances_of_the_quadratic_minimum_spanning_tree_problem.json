{"id":"282692114_A_characterization_of_linearizable_instances_of_the_quadratic_minimum_spanning_tree_problem","abstract":"We investigate special cases of the quadratic minimum spanning tree problem\n(QMSTP) on a graph $G=(V,E)$ that can be solved as a linear minimum spanning\ntree problem. Characterization of such problems on graphs with special\nproperties are given. This include complete graphs, complete bipartite graphs,\ncactuses among others. Our characterization can be verified in $O(|E|^2)$ time.\nIn the case of complete graphs and when the cost matrix is given in factored\nform, we show that our characterization can be verified in $O(|E|)$ time.\nRelated open problems are also indicated.","authors":["Ante Custic","Abraham P.
