{"id":"225451636_Differential_Privacy","abstract":"In 1977 Dalenius articulated a desideratum for statistical databases: nothing about an individual should be learnable from\nthe database that cannot be learned without access to the database. We give a general impossibility result showing that a\nformalization of Dalenius’ goal along the lines of semantic security cannot be achieved. Contrary to intuition, a variant\nof the result threatens the privacy even of someone not in the database. This state of affairs suggests a new measure, differential privacy, which, intuitively, captures the increased risk to one’s privacy incurred by participating in a database. The techniques\ndeveloped in a sequence of papers [8, 13, 3], culminating in those described in [12], can achieve any desired level of privacy\nunder this measure. In many cases, extremely accurate information about the database can be provided while simultaneously\nensuring very high levels of privacy.","authors":["Cynthia Dwork"],"meta":["June 2006Lecture Notes in Computer Science","DOI:10.1007/11787006_1","Conference: Proceedings of the 33rd international conference on Automata, Languages and Programming - Volume Part II"],"references":["225124717_Calibrating_Noise_to_Sensitivity_in_Private_Data_Analysis","221590592_Correcting_errors_without_leaking_partial_information","221559640_Revealing_Information_while_Preserving_Privacy","221559370_Practical_privacy_The_SulQ_framework","221354880_Privacy-Preserving_Datamining_on_Vertically_Partitioned_Databases","221347849_Fuzzy_Extractors_How_to_Generate_Strong_Keys_from_Biometrics_and_Other_Noisy_Data","220225085_Secure_Statistical_Databases_with_Random_Sample_Queries","262235629_Privacy-preserving_data_mining","244437489_On_the_Utility_of_Privacy-Preserving_Histograms","239576354_Towards_a_methodology_for_statistical_disclosure_control","227979327_Weaving_Technology_and_Policy_Together_to_Maintain_Confidentiality","222439046_Probabilistic_Encryption","221354100_Toward_Privacy_in_Public_Databases","221348113_Our_Data_Ourselves_Privacy_Via_Distributed_Noise_Generation","220565983_Security-Control_Methods_for_Statistical_Databases_A_Comparative_Study","220530683_Recent_Developments_in_Explicit_Constructions_of_Extractors","220225706_Secure_Databases_Protection_Against_User_Influence","12260117_Weaving_Technology_and_Policy_Together_to_Maintain_Confidentiality","2898359_Privacy-Preserving_Data_Mining","2875543_Limiting_Privacy_Breaches_in_Privacy_Preserving_Data_Mining","2368934_Randomness_is_Linear_in_Space"]}
