{"id":"333024802_Psychosocial_consequences_of_receiving_false-positive_colorectal_cancer_screening_results_a_qualitative_study","abstract":"Objective: The objective of this study was to investigate the psychosocial consequences of receiving false-positive colorectal cancer (CRC) screening results, following a positive immunochemical faecal occult blood test.\nDesign, setting, and subjects: We conducted a qualitative study with four semi-structured focus group interviews with 16 participants aged 50–74, all of whom had received a false-positive result in the national Danish CRC screening programme. We selected, recruited, and grouped participants to ensure maximum variation, and to enable a level of confidence to speak openly about experiences of screening. We subjected interview data, audio-recordings, and transcripts to a strategy of qualitative analysis called systematic text condensation.\nResults: We identified four main themes which described the psychosocial consequences of false-positive CRC screening results: anxiety; discomfort; changed self-perception and behaviour; and considerations on participation in screening. Each of these themes covered a wide range of experiences which were relevant to the informants and broadly shared by them in many aspects.\nConclusions: Receiving false-positive results from CRC screening can lead to negative psychosocial consequences such as changes in self-perception and anxiety: some participants may experience subsequent relief, others not. These negative psychosocial consequences might persist over time.\nImplications: Negative psychosocial consequences from false-positive CRC screening results may result in a greater use of general practitioner services by healthy people who need reassurance or further tests. More research using condition-specific measures is required to further understand the degree and potential persistence of psychosocial consequences of false-positive results from CRC screening.\n\n• Key Points\n• Participants who receive false-positive colorectal cancer (CRC) screening results may experience negative psychosocial consequences e.g. anxiety and subsequent relief.\n• Participants who receive false-positive CRC screening results may experience discomfort during the screening process.\n• Participants who receive false-positive CRC screening results may experience longer term changes of self-perception.\n• Participants who receive false-positive CRC screening results may experience ambivalence about the offered diagnostic down-stream procedures including colonoscopy.","authors":["Eva Lykke Toft","Sara Enggaard Kaae","Jessica Malmqvist","John Brodersen"],"meta":["May 2019Scandinavian Journal of Primary Health Care 37(2):1-10","DOI:10.1080/02813432.2019.1608040"],"references":["328169378_Psychosocial_consequences_among_women_with_false-positive_results_after_mammography_screening_in_Norway","291546253_Psychological_impact_of_colorectal_cancer_screening","264987410_The_Psychological_Harms_of_Screening_the_Evidence_We_Have_Versus_the_Evidence_We_Need","258313394_Hogberg_C_Karling_P_Rutefgard_J_Lilja_M_Ljung_TImmunochemical_faecal_occult_blood_tests_in_primary_care_and_the_risk_of_delay_in_the_diagnosis_of_colorectal_cancer_Scand_J_Primary_Health_Care_31_209-2","328674146_Anxiety_Associated_with_Colonoscopy_and_Flexible_Sigmoidoscopy_A_Systematic_Review","322691061_Overdiagnosis_what_it_is_and_what_it_isn't","311945324_Ethical_issues_with_colorectal_cancer_screening-a_systematic_review","295592163_Over-diagnosed_Making_People_Sick_in_the_Pursuit_of_Health","262605178_Overdiagnosis_How_cancer_screening_can_turn_indolent_pathology_into_illness","259511273_Healthcare_Costs_in_the_Danish_Randomised_Controlled_Lung_Cancer_CT-Screening_Trial_A_Registry_Study"]}
