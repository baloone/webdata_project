{"id":"226360469_A_multiresolution_method_for_fitting_scattered_data_on_the_sphere","abstract":"In this work, we propose an efficient multiresolution method for fitting scattered data functions on a sphereS, using a tensor product method of periodic algebraic trigonometric splines of order 3 and quadratic polynomial splines defined\non a rectangular map ofS. We describe the decomposition and reconstruction algorithms corresponding to the polynomial and periodic algebraic trigonometric\nwavelets. As application of this method, we give an algorithm which allows to compress scattered data on spherelike surfaces.\nIn order to illustrate our results, some numerical examples are presented.","authors":["Abdellah Lamnii","H.
