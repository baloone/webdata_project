{"id":"282564228_The_satisfiability_threshold_for_k-XORSAT","abstract":"We consider ‘unconstrained’ random k -XORSAT, which is a uniformly random system of m linear non-homogeneous equations in $\\mathbb{F}$2 over n variables, each equation containing k ⩾ 3 variables, and also consider a ‘constrained’ model where every variable appears in at least two equations. Dubois and Mandler proved that m/n = 1 is a sharp threshold for satisfiability of constrained 3-XORSAT, and analysed the 2-core of a random 3-uniform hypergraph to extend this result to find the threshold for unconstrained 3-XORSAT.\nWe show that m/n = 1 remains a sharp threshold for satisfiability of constrained k -XORSAT for every k ⩾ 3, and we use standard results on the 2-core of a random k -uniform hypergraph to extend this result to find the threshold for unconstrained k -XORSAT. For constrained k -XORSAT we narrow the phase transition window, showing that m − n → −∞ implies almost-sure satisfiability, while m − n → +∞ implies almost-sure unsatisfiability.","authors":["BORIS PITTEL","Gregory Sorkin"],"meta":["July 2015Combinatorics Probability and Computing -1(2):1-33","DOI:10.1017/S0963548315000097"],"references":["264957849_Sharp_thresholds_of_graph_properties_and_the_k-SAT_problem","233923014_The_Satisfiability_Threshold_for_k-XORSAT_using_an_alternative_proof","233753093_Rank_deficiency_in_sparse_random_GF2_matrices","227120401_Two_solutions_to_diluted_p-spin_models_and_XORSAT_problems","220980477_Random_2-XORSAT_at_the_satisfiability_threshold","305976564_Paths_in_a_random_digital_tree_limiting_distributions","243768150_Paths_in_a_Random_Digital_Tree_Limiting_Distributions","243134926_Sudden_Emergence_of_a_Giantk-Core_in_a_Random_Graph","242999800_The_3-XORSAT_threshold","229964836_On_the_rank_of_random_matrices","228863063_Tight_Thresholds_for_Cuckoo_Hashing_via_XORSAT_Extended_Abstract","227746530_Random_max_sat_Random_max_cut_and_Their_Phase_Transitions","221498363_Mick_Gets_Some_the_Odds_Are_on_His_Side","220573190_A_Threshold_for_Unsatisfiability","220345359_The_Cores_of_Random_Hypergraphs_with_a_Given_Degree_Sequence","220345350_Cores_in_random_hypergraphs_and_Boolean_formulas","51927526_The_Solution_Space_Geometry_of_Random_Linear_Equations","45917071_How_Frequently_is_a_System_of_2-Linear_Boolean_Equations_Solvable","41700812_Smooth_and_sharp_thresholds_for_random_k-XOR-CNF_satisfiability","4004028_The_3-XORSAT_threshold","2812256_The_Rank_of_Sparse_Random_Matrices_over_Finite_Fields","2142580_The_Scaling_Window_of_the_2-SAT_Transition"]}
