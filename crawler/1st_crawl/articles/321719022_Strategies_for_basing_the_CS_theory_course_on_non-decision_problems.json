{"id":"321719022_Strategies_for_basing_the_CS_theory_course_on_non-decision_problems","abstract":"Computational and complexity theory are core components of the computer science curriculum, and in the vast majority of cases are taught using decision problems as the main paradigm. For experienced practitioners, decision problems are the best tool. But for undergraduates encountering the material for the first time, we present evidence that non-decision problems (such as optimization problems and search problems) are preferable. In addition, we describe technical definitions and pedagogical strategies that have been used successfully for teaching the theory course using non-decision problems as the central concept.","authors":["John Maccormick"],"meta":["November 2017","Project: Theory of Computation Pedagogy"],"references":["265617090_The_Nature_of_Computation","333673359_What_Can_Be_Computed_A_Practical_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_Computation","311471871_On_teaching_theoretical_foundations_of_Computer_Science","274079001_An_Introduction_to_Formal_Languages_and_Automata","268992252_The_Golden_Ticket_P_NP_and_the_Search_for_the_Impossible","267147785_P_NP_and_NP-completeness_The_basics_of_computational_complexity","265073073_Automata_Computability_and_Complexity_Theory_and_Applications","262170662_From_theory_to_practice_NP-completeness_for_every_CS_student","246579200_JFLAP-An_Interactive_Formal_Languages_and_Automata_Package","234809416_NP-_Completeness_for_All_Computer_Science_Undergraduates_A_Novel_Project-_Based_Curriculum","220808440_Computer_lab_work_on_theory","228057894_Computational_Complexity","228057764_Introduction_To_Automata_Theory_Languages_And_Computation","221537538_Increasing_engagement_in_automata_theory_with_JFLAP","220693968_Computational_Complexity_A_Modern_Approach"]}
