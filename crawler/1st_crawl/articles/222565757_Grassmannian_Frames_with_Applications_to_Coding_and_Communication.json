{"id":"222565757_Grassmannian_Frames_with_Applications_to_Coding_and_Communication","abstract":"For a given class of unit norm frames of fixed redundancy we define a Grassmannian frame as one that minimizes the maximal correlation |〈fk,fl〉| among all frames . We first analyze finite-dimensional Grassmannian frames. Using links to packings in Grassmannian spaces and antipodal spherical codes we derive bounds on the minimal achievable correlation for Grassmannian frames. These bounds yield a simple condition under which Grassmannian frames coincide with unit norm tight frames. We exploit connections to graph theory, equiangular line sets, and coding theory in order to derive explicit constructions of Grassmannian frames. Our findings extend recent results on unit norm tight frames. We then introduce infinite-dimensional Grassmannian frames and analyze their connection to unit norm tight frames for frames which are generated by group-like unitary systems. We derive an example of a Grassmannian Gabor frame by using connections to sphere packing theory. Finally we discuss the application of Grassmannian frames to wireless communication and to multiple description coding.","authors":["Thomas Strohmer","Robert W.
