{"id":"220675534_The_Issue_of_Software_Plagiarism_A_Student_View","abstract":"The issue of plagiarism is discussed in the context of\nuniversity education in disciplines related to computing. The focus\nis therefore mainly on software plagiarism. First, however, a case is\nmade for the claim that the most important reason that plagiarism\ncannot be tolerated lies in the essence of the concept of a university\nas it is rooted in the Western cultural tradition. The main contri-\nbution of this paper is in providing ﬁrsthand insight into students’\nviews on some of the delicate questions related to student plagia-\nrism. However, this paper presents views from both sides of the\nquestion, including the views of staff members. This paper is quite\nunique in that it is coauthored by students who provide indepen-\ndent comments and recommendations.","authors":["Daniela Chuda","Pavol Navrat","Bianka Kovácová","Pavel Humay"],"meta":["February 2012IEEE Transactions on Education 55:22-28","DOI:10.1109/TE.2011.2112768","SourceDBLP"],"references":["248606848_Support_for_checking_plagiarism_in_e-learning","247186415_Plagiarism_A_misplaced_emphasis","234800714_Similarity_and_originality_in_code_Plagiarism_and_normal_variation_in_student_assignments","228973306_Qualitative_analysis_and_comparison_of_plagiarism-detection_systems_in_student_programs","228654731_Cheating_among_college_and_university_students_A_North_American_perspective","228450982_Plagiarism_really_is_a_crime_a_counterblast_against_anarchists_and_postmodernists_and_others","228244566_Plagiarism_Norms_and_the_Limits_of_Theft_Law_Some_Observations_on_the_Use_of_Criminal_Sanctions_in_Enforcing_Intellectual_Property_Rights","221574134_Plagiarism_detection_across_programming_languages","220328285_An_Approach_to_Source-Code_Plagiarism_Detection_and_Investigation_Using_Latent_Semantic_Analysis","220017646_Plagiarism_-_A_Survey","26575385_On_academic_plagiarism_in_Europe_An_analytical_approach_based_on_four_studies","26467422_Classifications_of_Plagiarism_detection_engines","3052957_On_Students'_Strategy-Preferences_for_Managing_Difficult_Course_Work","3052956_Avoiding_Plagiarism_in_Contexts_of_Development_and_Change","3052950_Towards_a_Definition_of_Source-Code_Plagiarism","2832828_Finding_Plagiarisms_among_a_Set_of_Programs_with_JPlag","298970948_Plagiarism_Norms_and_the_Limits_of_Theft_Law_Some_Observations_on_the_Use_of_Criminal_Sanctions_in_Enforcing_Intellectual_Property_Rights","281767436_Plagiarism_the_Internet_and_Student_Learning_Improving_Academic_Integrity","277196461_Academic_plagiarism_rules_and_ESL_learning_-_Mutually_exclusive_concepts","244438006_Plagiarism_in_natural_and_programming_languages_An_overview_of_current_tools_and_technologies","242234924_Plagiarism_and_students_from_Asia_studying_in_Australia_and_New_Zealand","234642446_The_Net_Generation_Cheating_Challenge","228972227_Software_Plagiarism_in_Undergraduate_Programming_Classes","228906168_Reducing_Effects_of_Plagiarism_in_Programming_Classes","228544461_Using_IT_to_combat_plagiarism_10_years_of_successes_and_failures","222974170_Exploring_the_types_and_reasons_of_Internet-triggered_academic_dishonesty_among_Turkish_undergraduate_students_Development_of_Internet-Triggered_Academic_Dishonesty_Scale_ITADS","221537494_Collaboration_vs_plagiarism_in_computer_science_programming_courses","221418746_Plagiarism_Detection_Based_on_Singular_Value_Decomposition","220795458_Turnitin_is_not_the_primary_weapon_in_the_campaign_against_plagiarism","3052951_Faculty_and_Student_Classroom_Influences_on_Academic_Dishonesty","3052949_A_Longitudinal_Study_of_Nonoriginal_Content_in_Final-Year_Computing_Undergraduate_Projects","3052946_A_Technological_Tool_to_Detect_Plagiarized_Projects_in_Microsoft_Access","3052945_Detection_of_Plagiarism_in_Programming_Assignments","3050527_Plagiarism_in_Programming_Assignments"]}
