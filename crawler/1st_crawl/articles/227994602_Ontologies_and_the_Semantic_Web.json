{"id":"227994602_Ontologies_and_the_Semantic_Web","abstract":"As an informational technology, the World Wide Web has enjoyed spectacular success. In just ten years it has transformed the way information is produced, stored, and shared in arenas as diverse as shopping, family photo albums, and high-level academic research.
