{"id":"277334541_Generalizing_the_Single-Crossing_Property_on_Lines_and_Trees_to_Intermediate_Preferences_on_Median_Graphs","abstract":"Demange (2012) generalized the classical single-crossing property to the\nintermediate property on median graphs and proved that the representative voter\ntheorem still holds for this more general framework. We complement her result\nwith proving that the linear orders of any profile which is intermediate on a\nmedian graph form a Condorcet domain. We prove that for any median graph there\nexists a profile that is intermediate with respect to that graph and that one\nmay need at least as many alternatives as vertices to construct such a profile.\nWe provide a polynomial-time algorithm to recognize whether or not a given\nprofile is intermediate with respect to some median graph. Finally, we show\nthat finding winners for the Chamberlin-Courant rule is polynomial-time\nsolvable for profiles that are single-crossing on a tree.","authors":["Adam Clearwater","Clemens Puppe","Arkadii M.
