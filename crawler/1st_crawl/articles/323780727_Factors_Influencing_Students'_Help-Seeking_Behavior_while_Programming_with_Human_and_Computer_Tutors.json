{"id":"323780727_Factors_Influencing_Students'_Help-Seeking_Behavior_while_Programming_with_Human_and_Computer_Tutors","abstract":"When novice students encounter diculty when learning to program, some can seek help from instructors or teaching assistants. is one-on-one tutoring is highly eective at fostering learning, but busy instructors and large class sizes can make expert help a scarce resource. Increasingly, programming environments attempt to imitate this human support by providing students with hints and feedback. In order to design eective, computer-based help, it is important to understand how and why students seek and avoid help when programming, and how this process diers when the help is provided by a human or a computer. We explore these questions through a qualitative analysis of 15 students’ interviews, in which they reect on solving two programming problems with human and computer help. We discuss implications for help design and present hypotheses on students’ help-seeking behavior.","authors":["Thomas W.
