{"id":"314711203_Generalized_Bent_Functions_and_Their_Gray_Images","abstract":"In this paper we prove that generalized bent (gbent) functions defined on \\(\\mathbb {F}_2^n\\) with values in \\(\\mathbb {Z}_{2^k}\\) are regular, and show connections between the (generalized) Walsh spectrum of these functions and their components. Moreover we analyze generalized bent and semibent functions with values in \\(\\mathbb {Z}_{16}\\) in detail, extending earlier results on gbent functions with values in \\(\\mathbb {Z}_4\\) and \\(\\mathbb {Z}_8\\).","authors":["Thor Martinsen","Wilfried Meidl","Pante Stănică"],"meta":["March 2016Lecture Notes in Computer Science","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-55227-9_12","Conference: International Workshop on the Arithmetic of Finite Fields"],"references":["283531545_Partial_Spread_and_Vectorial_Generalized_Bent_Functions","276596482_Generalized_Bent_Functions_-_Some_General_Construction_Methods_and_Related_Necessary_and_Sufficient_Conditions","242796716_Zsub_2k-linear_codes","220334712_Connections_between_Quaternary_and_Binary_Bent_Functions","280330346_Nonexistence_of_Generalized_Bent_Functions_From_Z_2n_to_Z_m","257554880_Bent_and_generalized_bent_Boolean_functions","224395319_Quaternary_Constant-Amplitude_Codes_for_Multicode_CDMA","222863869_Generalized_Bent_Functions_and_Their_Properties","222819394_Strongly_regular_graphs_associated_with_ternary_bent_functions"]}
