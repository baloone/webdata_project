As an application of our results, we obtain existence theorems for integral equations.\n\n1. Introduction\nFixed-point theory is a very important tool for proving the existence and uniqueness of the solutions to various mathematical models, such as integral and partial differential equations, optimization, variational inequalities, and approximation theory. Fixed-point theory has also gained considerable importance in the recent past after the famous Banach contraction theorem [1]. Since then, there have been many results related to mappings satisfying various types of contractive inequalities [2–5]. Recently, Gordji et al. [6] introduced an exciting notion of the orthogonal sets after which, orthogonal metric spaces were introduced. The concept of a sequence, continuity, and completeness has been redefined in this space. Further, they gave an extension of the Banach fixed-point theorem on this newly described shape and also applied their theorem to show the existence of a solution for a differential equation, which cannot be applied by the Banach fixed-point theorem.\nOn the other hand, many definitions and theorems in the literature do not require that all of the properties of a metric hold true. In the last decades, many concepts of generalized metrics (as controlled and double controlled metrics) have been introduced (see [7, 8]).\nGauge spaces are characterized by the fact that the distance between two points may be zero even if the two points are distinct. For instance, Frigon [9] and Chis and Precup [10] gave a generalization of the Banach contraction principle on gauge spaces. In the same direction, many interesting results have been raised obtained by different authors in [11–17]. In 2013, Ali et al. [18] ensured the existence of fixed points for an integral operator via a fixed-point theorem on complete gauge spaces. In 2012, Wardowski [19] gave a new type of contractions, named as -contractions, and established new related fixed-point results. This contraction type nicely generalizes the most famous Banach contraction condition. Later on, many researchers worldwide generalized this result (see [20–24]).\nTo give the ongoing research a new direction, we have combined the above statements in two directions of research. For this, we apply the concept of orthogonality in gauge spaces and investigate the existence of solutions of integral equations through the fixed-point theorem on orthogonal complete gauge spaces.\n\n2. Preliminaries and Basic Definitions\nFirst, we include some basic definitions and theorems which are useful to understand the results presented in this paper.\nWardowski [19] introduced the family of all functions so that (: for all with , we have (): for each positive sequence , iff (): there is so that\nThe following are elements in :(i) for (ii) for (iii) for\nFurther, Wardowski [19] introduced F-contractions and the related fixed-point theorem in the following way.\nTheorem 1 (see [19]). Let be a complete metric space and let be an F-contraction mapping, that is, there are and so that for all impliesThen admits a unique fixed point in .\nMinak et al. [25] generalized this result as follows.\nTheorem 2 (see [25]). Let be a complete metric space and be a self-mapping. Suppose that there are and so thatfor all , with . If or is continuous, then admits a unique fixed point.\nNow, we explain the notion of a pseudometric.\nDefinition 1 (see [26]). Let be a nonempty set. A function is said to be a pseudometric on if for all :(i)(ii)(iii)\nExample 1. Denote by the set of continuous real-valued functions with . This point then induces a pseudometric on defined as .\nIn 2017, Gordji et al. [6] initiated the notion of an orthogonal set (or o-set).\nDefinition 2 (see [6]). Let and be a binary relation defined on . The pair is called an orthogonal set (or an o-set), ifThe element is said to be orthogonal. An orthogonal set may have more than one orthogonal element.\nExample 2 (see [6]). Let . We write that if there is so that . Note that for each . Hence, is an o-set.\nDefinition 3 (see [6]). Let be an o-set. Any two elements are said to be orthogonally related iff .\nDefinition 4 (see [6]). Let be an o-set. A mapping is said to be -preserving if for all orthogonally related elements , we have .\nDefinition 5 (see [6]). Let be an orthogonal set. is said to be an orthogonal sequence (briefly, an o-sequence) if\n\n3. Orthogonal Gauge Space\nThe simplest way of defining an orthogonal gauge space is that the gauge space defined on an o-set is called an orthogonal gauge space. The precise discussion is given below.\nLet be an o-set and be a pseudometric on , then is said to be an orthogonal pseudometric space (or an o-pseudometric space).\nExample 3. Let be the set of continuous real-valued functions with . This element induces an orthogonal pseudometric on defined by and the orthogonality on is given as iff or .\nDefinition 6. Let be an orthogonal pseudometric space. Then, the orthogonal d-ball (or -ball) of radius and centered at is the set .\nNote that when we say that is an o-pseudometric on , it means that is an o-set and is a pseudometric on .\nDefinition 7. A family of o-pseudometrics on is said to be separating if for each pair such that , there is with .\nDefinition 8. Let be the family of o-pseudometrics on . Then, the topology having as a subbasis the set of ballsis said to be the topology induced by the set of o-pseudometrics. The pair is called an orthogonal gauge space.\nDefinition 9. Let be an orthogonal gauge space with respect to the family of o-pseudometrics on .(i)An orthogonal sequence converges to if(ii)An orthogonal sequence is Cauchy if(iii) is an o-complete gauge space iff each Cauchy o-sequence in converges to an element of .(iv)A subset of is called closed if it contains the limit of each convergent o-sequence.\n\n4. Fixed-Point Results on Orthogonal Gauge Structure\nIn this section, we study the existence of fixed points for a mapping satisfying certain conditions on an orthogonal gauge structure.

ThenBy taking and , one can conclude that (8) holds for all with and for each .\nAlso, for , we have for each , then at least one of them is the zero function, and hence, for each , that is, . Thus, is -preserving. Further, for , , and so and . Furthermore, for all with and , we know that and are constant functions, then and are also constant functions, and so .\nMoreover, for each o-sequence in with for each and , we have . Therefore, and for each .\nConsequently, all the conditions in Theorem 3 are verified. One can conclude that possesses a fixed point.\nRemark 1. For the functions defined in the above example, note that (8) does not hold for every . It suffices to take and , then and . Also note that and .\nTheorem 4.

Using (ii), there is with and , and by considering (iii), we get . Moreover, we have , since is -preserving. Repetition of the same arguments implies that and for each . Consider . Then is an o-sequence with for each . Also, note that if there is some such that , then is a fixed point of . Thus, we assume that such a natural number does not exist. As with and , then from (34), we getIf we assume that , then we have a contradiction with respect to (35). Thus, for all . Using (35), we haveAgain, we know that and ; then, from (34), we haveIf we assume that , then we have a contradiction to (37). Thus, . Thus, from (37), we haveFrom (36) and (38), we haveWorking with the same steps, we obtainLetting in (40), we get for all . Thus, by property , we have . Let for all and for each .
