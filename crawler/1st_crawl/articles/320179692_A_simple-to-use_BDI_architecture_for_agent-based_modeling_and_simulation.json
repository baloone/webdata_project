{"id":"320179692_A_simple-to-use_BDI_architecture_for_agent-based_modeling_and_simulation","abstract":"With the increase of computing power and the development of userfriendly multi-agent simulation frameworks, social simulations have become increasingly realistic. However, most agent architectures in these simulations use simple reactive models. Cognitive architectures face two main obstacles: their complexity for the field-expert modeler, and their computational cost. In this paper, we propose a new cognitive agent architecture based on the BDI (Belief-Desire-Intention) paradigm integrated into the GAMA modeling platform. Based on the GAML modeling language, this architecture was designed to be simpleto- use for modelers, flexible enough to manage complex behaviors, and with low computational cost. This architecture is illustrated with a simulation of the evolution of land use in the Mekong Delta.","authors":["Philippe Caillou","Benoit Gaudou","Arnaud Grignard","Quang TRUONG Chi"],"meta":["January 2017","Project: ACTEUR"],"references":["304497189_Evaluating_the_changes_of_soil_poperties_and_land_use_at_three_coastal_districts_in_Soc_Trang_province","287362915_OpenSim_A_framework_for_integrating_agent-based_models_and_simulation_components","256120598_Vulnerability_to_Flood_in_the_Vietnamese_Mekong_Delta_Mapping_and_Uncertainty_Assessment","236630646_MATSim-T_Architecture_and_simulation_times","234734570_A_new_BDI_agent_architecture_based_on_the_belief_theory_Application_to_the_modelling_of_cropping_plan_decision-making","222387669_The_Map_Comparison_Kit","271154070_Intention_Plans_and_Practical_Reason","244436493_NetLogo_Center_for_connected_learning_and_computer-based_modeling","227136961_Sea_Level_Rise_Affecting_the_Vietnamese_Mekong_Delta_Water_Elevation_in_the_Flood_Season_and_Implications_for_Rice_Production","226144144_Jadex_A_BDI_reasoning_engine"]}
