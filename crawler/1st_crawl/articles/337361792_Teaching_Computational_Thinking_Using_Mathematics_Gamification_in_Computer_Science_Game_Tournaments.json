{"id":"337361792_Teaching_Computational_Thinking_Using_Mathematics_Gamification_in_Computer_Science_Game_Tournaments","abstract":"One of the key foundations in computer science is abstract algebra. Ideas of abstract algebra can be introduced to students at middle or pre-college schools to cultivate their capacity for logical thinking and problem-solving skills as well as gaining mathematical competency required in computer science. In this book chapter, we introduce ideas of mathematics gamification and a mobile app game, Algebra Game, richly rooted in abstract algebra and first proposed by the mathematician Tao (Gamifying algebra, 2012a, Software mock-up of algebra game 2012b). The Algebra Game teaches elementary algebra seemingly on the surface, and yet the game-play design possesses interesting abstract algebra ideas and mathematics gamification potential. We define mathematics gamification as the process of embedding mathematical concepts and their logical manipulations in a puzzle game-like setting aided by computers. We describe several mathematics gamification instances to enrich the Algebra Game play. Finally, we evaluate the learning efficacy of the Algebra Game mobile app software in computer science game tournaments modeled after eSports-like computer games in order to scale up the number of students who can learn the Algebra Game mathematics.","authors":["Chee Wei Tan","Pei-Duo Yu","Ling Lin"],"meta":["May 2019","DOI:10.1007/978-981-13-6528-7_10","In book: Computational Thinking Education (pp.167-181)"],"references":["287126963_Wuzzit_Trouble_The_Influence_of_a_Digital_Math_Game_on_Student_Number_Sense","274309848_Computational_Thinking","220420371_Computational_thinking","268162030_Mathematics_education_for_a_new_era_Video_games_as_a_medium_for_learning","220431315_Form_and_Content_in_Computer_Science_1970_ACM_turing_lecture"]}
