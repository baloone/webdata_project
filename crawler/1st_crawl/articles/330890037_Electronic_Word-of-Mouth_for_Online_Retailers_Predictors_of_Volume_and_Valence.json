{"id":"330890037_Electronic_Word-of-Mouth_for_Online_Retailers_Predictors_of_Volume_and_Valence","abstract":"The goal of this research was to build a model that evaluates the influence of affective commitment, high-sacrifice commitment, and satisfaction on the customersâ€™ word-of-mouth concerning an online retailer. Two word-of-mouth dimensions were considered: volume and valence. A survey was administered to 282 respondents and structural equation modeling techniques were used to process the data and test the hypotheses. Our findings show that satisfaction and high-sacrifice commitment have an important impact on both word-of-mouth volume and valence, while affective commitment only influences word-of-mouth valence. This paper offers detailed explanations of these results in light of other theories and studies in the field.","authors":["Bogdan Anastasiei","Nicoleta Dospinescu"],"meta":["February 2019Sustainability 11(3):814","DOI:10.3390/su11030814","Project: eWOM on Facebook"],"references":["329055482_Negative_Word-of-Mouth_by_Dissatisfied_Consumers_A_Pilot_Study","328163060_E-satisfaction_in_business-to-consumer_electronic_commerce","327090004_Examining_the_Role_of_Online_Reviews_in_Chinese_Online_Group_Buying_Context_The_Moderating_Effect_of_Promotional_Marketing","325700781_Enhancement_of_E-Commerce_Websites_with_Semantic_Web_Technologies","348900868_Structural_Equation_Modeling_Using_AMOS_A_step_by_step_approach","329264139_Return_on_Quality_ROQ_Making_Service_Quality_Financially_Accountable","329256588_A_Cognitive_Model_of_the_Antecedents_and_Consequences_of_Satisfaction_Decisions","329055405_Role_of_Product-Related_Conversations_in_the_Diffusion_of_a_New_Product","329054802_A_Rating_Scale_for_Measuring_Product_Service_Satisfaction","329046806_A_Test_of_Services_Marketing_Theory_Consumer_Information_Acquisition_Activities"]}
