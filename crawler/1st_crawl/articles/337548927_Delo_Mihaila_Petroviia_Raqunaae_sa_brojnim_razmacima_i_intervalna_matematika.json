{"id":"337548927_Delo_Mihaila_Petroviia_Raqunaae_sa_brojnim_razmacima_i_intervalna_matematika","abstract":"Mihailo Petrovich first published ,,Calculation with numerical intervals” in 1932 in the Serbianlanguage. The realese was reprinted in 1969 in the editorial Dr. Petar Vasic and Dr. Milorad Beretolino.The development of interval mathematics began in the 1960s with R. E. Moore [3] as its main protagonist. The interval mathematics quickly became a significant field in mathematics with prominent use in computer sciences and numerus papers were published in this field. The key question is: ,, Did M. Petrovich influence the development of interval mathematics?” The development of interval mathematics\ncommenced with interval arithmetic and it was inspired by electronic computers. One could not make a strong claim that the work of M. Perovich dirctly influenced development of interval mathematics. However, his groundbreaking work was very important for a wide spectrum of mathematical disciplines in which the intervals are applied (arithmetic, geometry, differential and integral equations, to name a few). Subsequent publications by Russian mathematicians (especially Chaplygin [7]), pointed out the significance of M. Petrovich’s ideas in solving the initial value problem at ordinary differential equations.","authors":["Dušan Tošić"],"meta":["November 2019","Project: History of computing"],"references":["268839311_Some_problems_related_to_discretization_of_Chaplygin's_method","266723604_The_Contribution_of_T_Sunaga_to_Interval_Analysis_and_Reliable_Computing","238753987_Interval_Computation","311366000_A_generalized_interval_arithmetic"]}
