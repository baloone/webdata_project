{"id":"287222007_One-homogeneous_weight_codes_over_finite_chain_rings","abstract":"This paper determines the structures of one-homogeneous weight codes over finite chain rings and studies the algebraic properties of these codes. We present explicit constructions of one-homogeneous weight codes over finite chain rings. By taking advantage of the distance- preserving Gray map defined in [7] from the finite chain ring to its residue field, we obtain a family of optimal one-Hamming weight codes over the residue field. Further, we propose a generalized method that also includes the examples of optimal codes obtained by Shi et al. in [17].","authors":["Mustafa SarÄ±","Irfan Siap","Vedat Siap"],"meta":["January 2015Bulletin of the Korean Mathematical Society 52(6):2011-2023","DOI:10.4134/BKMS.2015.52.6.2011"],"references":["289880805_One-weight_Z4-linear_Codes","287629170_Optimal_p-ary_codes_from_one-weight_linear_codes_over_Zpm","267166888_Measure_theory_A_first_course","256711415_A_class_of_optimal_p-ary_codes_from_one-weight_codes_over_FpuumFpuum","242371333_The_Theory_of_Error_Correcting_Codes","239328993_A_metric_for_codes_over_residue_class_rings_of_integers","237133187_Every_equidistant_linear_code_is_a_sequence_of_dual_Hamming_codes","225355264_On_the_Structure_of_Linear_and_Cyclic_Codes_Over_a_Finite_Chain_Ring","225224346_On_Perfect_Ternary_Constant_Weight_Codes","220082334_The_Structure_of_Linear_Codes_of_Constant_Weight"]}
