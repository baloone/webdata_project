{"id":"311963892_Attribute_Selection_for_Partially_Labeled_Categorical_Data_By_Rough_Set_Approach","abstract":"Attribute selection is considered as the most characteristic result in rough set theory to distinguish itself to other theories. However, existing attribute selection approaches can not handle partially labeled data. So far, few studies on attribute selection in partially labeled data have been conducted. In this paper, the concept of discernibility pair based on rough set theory is raised to construct a uniform measure for the attributes in both supervised framework and unsupervised framework. Based on discernibility pair, two kinds of semisupervised attribute selection algorithm based on rough set theory are developed to handle partially labeled categorical data. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed attribute selection algorithms.","authors":["Jianhua Dai","Qinghua Hu","Jinghong Zhang","Hu Hu"],"meta":["December 2016IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics PP(99)","DOI:10.1109/TCYB.2016.2636339"],"references":["303718016_DualPOS_A_Semi-supervised_Attribute_Selection_Approach_for_Symbolic_Data_Based_on_Rough_Set_Theory","301241180_Discrete_particle_swarm_optimization_approach_for_cost_sensitive_attribute_reduction","273463169_A_Multiobjective_Genetic_Programming-Based_Ensemble_for_Simultaneous_Feature_Selection_and_Classification","313199820_Rough_set_approach_to_incomplete_information_systems","302415308_An_algorithm_for_computing_a_single_covering_Kluwer_Academic_Publishers","297184636_New_method_for_fast_computing_positive_region","284004407_Forward_Semi-supervised_Feature_Selection","282744620_Semi-supervised_feature_selection_and_clustering_for_multi-view_data","279862949_Pairwise_Constraint-Guided_Sparse_Learning_for_Feature_Selection","275355520_Adversarial_Feature_Selection_Against_Evasion_Attacks"]}
