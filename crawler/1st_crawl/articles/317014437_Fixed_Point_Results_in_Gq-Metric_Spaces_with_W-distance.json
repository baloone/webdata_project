{"id":"317014437_Fixed_Point_Results_in_Gq-Metric_Spaces_with_W-distance","abstract":"The aim of this paper is to introduce the concept of G q-metric space. We establish the existence of fixed points of Jachymski type mappings in the framework of G q-metric spaces equipped with w-distance. Our results generalize and extend various results in the existing literature. Several examples to support our results are also presented.","authors":["Mujahid Abbas","Huaping Huang","Muhammad Sarwar","Muhammad Shoaib"],"meta":["January 2016"],"references":["258379175_Contractive_Mapping_in_Generalized_Ordered_Metric_Spaces_with_Application_in_Integral_Equations","268635217_Strictly_convex_and_2-convex_2-normed_spaces","266546107_A_fixed_point_theorem_in_generalized_ordered_metric_spaces_with_application","266431059_On_generalized_metric_spaces_and_topological_structure_II","266430558_On_continuity_of_mappings_in_D-metric_spaces","266420844_On_generalized_metric_spaces_and_topological_structure_II","265522931_A_new_approach_to_generalized_metric_spaces","264961054_Generalized_metric_spaces_mappings_with_fixed_point","246085491_Equivalent_Conditions_and_the_Meir-Keeler_Type_Theorems","237133127_Integrable_solution_of_functional_equations"]}
