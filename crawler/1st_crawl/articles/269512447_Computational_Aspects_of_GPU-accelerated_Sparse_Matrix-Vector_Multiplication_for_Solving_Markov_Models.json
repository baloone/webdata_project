{"id":"269512447_Computational_Aspects_of_GPU-accelerated_Sparse_Matrix-Vector_Multiplication_for_Solving_Markov_Models","abstract":"In this article we investigate some computational aspects of GPU-accelerated matrix-vector multiplication where matrix is sparse. Particularly, we deal with sparse matrices appearing in modelling with Markovian queuing models. The model we use for research is a Markovian queuing model of a wireless device. This model describes the device’s behavior during possible channel occupation by other devices. We study the efficiency of multiplication of a sparse matrix by a dense vector with the use of an appropriate, ready-to-use GPU-accelerated mathematical library, namely CUSP. For the CUSP library we discuss data structures and their impact on the CUDA platform for the fine-grained parallel architecture of the GPU. Our aim is to find the best format for storing a sparse matrix for GPU-computation (especially one associated with the Markovian model of a wireless device). We compare the time, the performance and the speed-up for the card NVIDIA Tesla C2050 (with ECC ON). For unstructured matrices (as our Markovian matrices), we observe speed-ups (in respect to CPU-only computations) of over 8 times.","authors":["Beata Bylina","Jarosław Bylina","Marek Karwacki"],"meta":["August 2011Theoretical and Applied Informatics 23(2)","DOI:10.2478/v10179-011-0009-5"],"references":["220481400_DiVinE-CUDA_-_A_Tool_for_GPU_Accelerated_LTL_Model_Checking","43475037_Inexact_Uniformization_Method_for_Computing_Transient_Distributions_of_Markov_Chains","228680178_Efficient_Sparse_Matrix-Vector_Multiplication_on_CUDA","220691339_Introduction_to_the_Numerical_Solution_of_Markov_Chains","4080676_On_the_throughput_performance_of_CSMA-based_wireless_local_area_network_with_directional_antennas_and_capture_effect_A_cross-layer_analytical_approach","3234321_Performance_analysis_of_the_IEEE_80211_distributed_coordination_function"]}
