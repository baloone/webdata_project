{"id":"273398910_Software-Defined_Networking_A_survey","abstract":"Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is considered promising to simplify network management and enable research innovations based on the decomposition of the control and data planes. In this paper, we review SDN-related technologies. In particular, we try to cover three main parts of SDN: applications, the control plane, and the data plane anticipating that our efforts will help researchers set appropriate and meaningful directions for future SDN research.","authors":["Hamid Farhady","HyunYong Lee","Akihiro Nakao"],"meta":["April 2015Computer Networks 81","DOI:10.1016/j.comnet.2015.02.014"],"references":["262274156_OpenFlow_vulnerability_assessment","262254862_Maple_Simplifying_SDN_Programming_Using_Algorithmic_Policies","261661906_Protocol-oblivious_forwarding_unleash_the_power_of_SDN_through_a_future-proof_forwarding_plane","261115867_Realizing_packet-optical_integration_with_SDN_and_OpenFlow_11_extensions","261115864_Scalable_fault_management_for_OpenFlow","316858705_Seamless_interworking_of_SDN_and_IP","316857366_M2cloud_software_defined_multi-site_data_center_network_control_framework_for_multi-tenant","316857231_B4_experience_with_a_globally-deployed_software_defined_wan","316857111_Forwarding_metamorphosis_fast_programmable_match-action_processing_in_hardware_for_SDN","316856668_OpenRAN_a_software-defined_ran_architecture_via_virtualization","288260795_A_survey_on_software_defined_networking_sdn_and_openflow_From_concept_to_implementation","285564933_TagFlow_Efficient_Flow_Classification_in_SDN","285564855_Ouroboros_Protocol_Independent_Forwarding_for_SDN","279871345_Ethane","279402289_NOX","278723609_Veriflow","278664988_DevoFlow","277679005_SP4","275481149_Making_middleboxes_someone_else's_problem","273296240_A_Survey_on_Mobile_Social_Networks_Applications_Platforms_System_Architectures_and_Future_Research_Directions","272157395_A_Design_and_Prototyping_of_In-Network_Processing_Platform_to_Enable_Adaptive_Network_Services","266660184_User-defined_actions_for_SDN","266486672_Towards_Programmable_Enterprise_WLANs_with_Odin","262394152_OpenRAN_A_software-defined_RAN_architecture_via_virtualization","262364586_B4_Experience_with_a_Globally-Deployed_Software_Defined_WAN","262355865_FleXam_Flexible_sampling_extension_for_monitoring_and_security_applications_in_OpenFlow","262346909_Verifying_forwarding_plane_connectivity_and_locating_link_failures_using_static_rules_in_software_defined_networks","262330254_Toward_predictable_performance_in_software_packet-processing_platforms","262312234_Forwarding_Metamorphosis_Fast_Programmable_Match-Action_Processing_in_Hardware_for_SDN","262275390_Towards_a_secure_controller_platform_for_openflow_applications","262250548_Achieving_High_Utilization_with_Software-Driven_WAN","262234514_SoR-Based_Programmable_Network_for_Future_Software-Defined_Network","262222245_Incremental_consistent_updates","262218450_M2cloud_Software_Defined_Multi-site_Data_Center_Network_Control_Framework_for_Multi-tenant","262217465_Cementing_high_availability_in_openflow_with_RuleBricks","262210520_The_FlowAdapter_Enable_flexible_multi-table_processing_on_legacy_hardware","262209340_HyperFlow_A_Distributed_Control_Plane_for_OpenFlow","262154123_Attacking_software-defined_networks_A_first_feasibility_study","261843817_SANE_a_protection_architecture_for_enterprise_networks","261503085_QoS-aware_optical_burst_switching_in_OpenFlow_based_Software-Defined_Optical_Networks","261320789_OpenFlow_Why_latency_does_matter","261320787_Reliability-aware_controller_placement_for_Software-Defined_Networks","261306889_Scissors_Dealing_with_header_redundancies_in_data_centers_through_SDN","261116680_NCP_Service_replication_in_data_centers_through_software_defined_networking","261116086_Driving_Software_Defined_Networks_with_XSP","261115869_Supporting_Information-Centric_Functionality_in_Software_Defined_Networks","261115865_A_programmable_networking_switch_node_with_in-network_processing_support","261110553_Opengate_on_OpenFlow_System_Outline","261109268_Hybrid_Control_Model_for_Flow-Based_Networks","261088295_In-network_ad-targeting_through_WiFi_AP_virtualization","261075906_Toward_Software-Defined_Cellular_Networks","261075685_Pursuing_a_Software_Defined_Information-centric_Network","261060209_Traffic_engineering_in_software_defined_networks","261057443_An_OpenFlow-based_Testbed_for_Information_Centric_Networking","260708200_On_scalability_of_software-defined_networking"]}
