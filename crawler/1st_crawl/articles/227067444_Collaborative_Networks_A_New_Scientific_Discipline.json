{"id":"227067444_Collaborative_Networks_A_New_Scientific_Discipline","abstract":"Collaborative networks manifest in a large variety of forms, including virtual organizations, virtual enterprises, dynamic supply chains, professional virtual communities, collaborative virtual laboratories, etc. A large body of empiric knowledge related to collaborative networks is already available, but there is an urgent need to consolidate this knowledge and build the foundations for a more sustainable development of this area. The establishment of a scientific discipline for collaborative networks is a strong instrument in achieving this purpose. In this article the main characteristics of a “discipline” are analyzed in the context of collaborative networks, showing that the pre-conditions necessary for building this new discipline are available.","authors":["Luis Camarinha-Matos","Hamideh Afsarmanesh"],"meta":["January 2005Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing 16(4):439-452","DOI:10.1007/s10845-005-1656-3"],"references":["254922939_Collaborative_networked_organizations_-_A_research_agenda_for_emerging_business_models","220832714_A_Roadmap_For_Strategic_Research_On_Virtual_Organizations","220832636_COCONET_A_Roadmap_for_Context-Aware_Cooperation_Environments","324937048_The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions","281137252_IFIP_International_Federation_for_Information_Processing","270162336_In_The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions","248027271_The_Structure_of_Scientific","238124458_Evolution_of_Networks_From_Biological_Nets_to_the_Internet_and_WWW","220833083_Basic_Concepts_And_Approaches_To_Develop_Interoperability_Of_Enterprise_Applications","220832486_Foundation_For_Networking_A_Theoretical_View_On_The_Virtual_Organization","220832467_New_Collaborative_Organizations_And_Their_Research_Needs","220449478_Coalitions_of_manufacturing_components_for_shop_floor_agility_-_the_CoBASA_architecture","220327363_The_New_Science_of_Networks","216868810_VLAM-G_A_grid-based_virtual_laboratory","46299002_A_Case_Study_of_vo_Education_in_Costa_Rica"]}
