{"id":"268606008_Survey_of_hereditary_properties_of_graphs","abstract":"In this paper we survey results and open problems on the structure of additive and hereditary properties of graphs. The important role of vertex partition problems, in particular the existence of uniquely partitionable graphs and reducible properties of graphs in this structure , is emphasized. Many related topics, including questions on the complexity of related problems, are investigated.","authors":["Mieczyslaw Borowiecki","Izak Broere","Marietjie Frick","Peter Mih√≥k"],"meta":["January 1997Discussiones Mathematicae Graph Theory 17(1)","DOI:10.7151/dmgt.1037","Project: Generalized Graph Coloring"],"references":["269011458_Maximal_graphs_with_respect_to_hereditary_properties","302205970_Sur_le_coloriage_des_graphs","276169042_Graph_Theory_With_Applications","269006241_Partitions_of_vertices","268844436_On_graphs_critical_with_respect_to_generalized_independence_numbers","268718798_On_characterizations_with_forbidden_subgraphs","268663575_On_vertex_partition_numbers_of_graphs","268657504_On_decomposition_of_graphs","268500794_Uniquely_Partitionable_Graphs","267442160_A_note_on_maximal_k-degenerate_graphs"]}
