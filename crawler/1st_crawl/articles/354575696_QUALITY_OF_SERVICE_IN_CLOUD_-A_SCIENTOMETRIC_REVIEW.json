{"id":"354575696_QUALITY_OF_SERVICE_IN_CLOUD_-A_SCIENTOMETRIC_REVIEW","abstract":"Clouds are large pool of computing and/or storage resources, which can be accessed via standard protocols with an abstract interface. Cloud is now more popular and developing rapidly. In recent years this popularity leads huge amount of publication. Cloud is applicable in every area of research so it has interdisciplinary importance Due to its interdisciplinary nature it is very hard to understand the overall structure and development of field. The aim of this Scientometrics analysis is to evaluate the cloud computing research on the basis of stream, keywords, authors and country. This paper is also present shift of research from past to current state. In this paper we report the search criteria for \"cloud computing + virtual machine + quality of service\". The results of this study indicate that the country India and China have major contribution in the cloud research, cloud computing is more popular in computer science stream and research is shifting towards providing the quality of service in cloud.","authors":["Umesh jagannath Tupe"],"meta":["February 2019"],"references":["329299543_Time-Aware_QoS_Prediction_for_Cloud_Service_Recommendation_Based_on_Matrix_Factorization","327093313_Quality_of_Experience_Framework_for_Cloud_Computing_QoC","332432925_QoS-aware_Virtual_Machine_Placement_for_Infrastructure_Cloud","331269651_Internet_of_Things_Task_Scheduling_in_Cloud_Environment_Using_Particle_Swarm_Optimization","324717127_Towards_End-to-End_QoS_and_Cost-Aware_Resource_Scaling_in_Cloud-Based_IoT_Data_Processing_Pipelines","324249897_Towards_Green_Cloud_Computing_Demand_Allocation_and_Pricing_Policies_for_Cloud_Service_Brokerage","323460076_Data-Driven_Computing_and_Caching_in_5G_Networks_Architecture_and_Delay_Analysis","321401750_A_Novel_QoS_Prediction_Approach_for_Cloud_Services_Using_Bayesian_Network_Model","319197372_Energy-aware_task_assignment_for_mobile_cyber-enabled_applications_in_heterogeneous_cloud_computing","250923814_'Big_Data'_Hadoop_and_Cloud_Computing_in_Genomics"]}
