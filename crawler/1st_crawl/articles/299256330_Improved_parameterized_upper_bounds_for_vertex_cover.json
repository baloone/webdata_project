{"id":"299256330_Improved_parameterized_upper_bounds_for_vertex_cover","abstract":"This paper presents an O(1.2738(k) + kn)-time polynomial-space parameterized algorithm for VERTEX COVER improving the previous O(1.286 k + kn)-time polynomial-space upper bound by Chen, Kanj, and Jia. The algorithm also improves the O(1.2745(k)k(4) + kn)-time exponential-space upper bound for the problem by Chandran and Grandoni.","authors":["Jianer Chen","Iyad A.
