{"id":"222664914_Stages_of_knowledge_management_systems_in_police_investigations","abstract":"The amount of information that police officers come into contact with in the course of their work is astounding. By identifying stages of growth in knowledge management systems and by identifying examples of applications from police investigations, this paper makes an important contribution to strategic planning of knowledge management systems in law enforcement. The stages are labeled officer-to-technology systems, officer-to-officer systems, officer-to-information systems, and officer-to-application systems.","authors":["Petter Gottschalk"],"meta":["October 2006Knowledge-Based Systems 19(6):381-387","DOI:10.1016/j.knosys.2006.04.002","SourceDBLP"],"references":["262592096_Management_information_systems_managing_the_digital_firm","260323200_Behavioral_Intention_Formation_in_Knowledge_Sharing_Examining_the_Roles_of_Extrinsic_Motivators_Social-Psychological_Forces_and_Organizational_Climate","260176842_Enhanced_Electroluminescence_of_Polymer_Light-Emitting_Diodes_with_Direct_Polyaniline_Synthesized_Anodes","234793431_COPLINK_-_Managing_law_enforcement_data_and_knowledge","228869393_The_influence_of_technical_social_and_structural_factors_on_the_effective_use_of_information_in_a_policing_environment","220260379_Contributing_Knowledge_to_Electronic_Knowledge_Repositories_An_Empirical_Investigation","220260227_Absorptive_Capacity_Configurations_in_Supply_Chains_Gearing_for_Partner-Enabled_Market_Knowledge_Creation","220260102_Knowledge_Acquisition_via_Three_Learning_Processes_in_Enterprise_Information_Portals_Learning-by-Investment_Learning-by-Doing_and_Learning-from-Others","220260061_A_Sender-Receiver_Framework_for_Knowledge_Transfer","220259953_Vicious_and_Virtuous_Circles_in_the_Management_of_Knowledge_The_Case_of_Infosys_Technologies","220259854_Antecedents_of_Knowledge_Transfer_from_Consultants_to_Clients_in_Enterprise_System_Implementations","200772522_Review_Knowledge_Management_and_Knowledge_Management_Systems_Conceptual_Foundations_and_Research_Issues","313082025_Knowledge_management_and_knowledge_management_systems_conceptual_foundations_and_research_issues","289115510_Knowledge_Management_Systems_in_Law_Enforcement_Technologies_and_Techniques","284504089_Whats_your_strategy_for_managing_knowledge","268054269_The_Effective_Detective_Identifying_the_skills_of_an_effective_SIO","262311312_Review_of_Strategic_knowledge_management_technology_by_Petter_Gottschalk_Idea_Group_Inc_Hershey_PA_2005","248942427_Tools_for_Collaboration_Using_and_Designing_Tools_in_Interorganizational_Economic-Crime_Investigation","242926400_Knowledge_management_in_the_public_sector_Principles_and_practices_in_police_work","242423445_Managing_the_Crisis_in_Data_Processing","242337182_The_Strategic_Management_of_Technology","237035826_Management_information_systems_managing_the_digital_firm_8th_Edition","235280309_The_thinking_eye_Pros_and_cons_of_second_generation_CCTV_surveillance_systems","227656667_Integration_Between_Business_Planning_and_Information_Systems_Planning_Validating_a_Stage_Hypothesis","227624943_Evolving_the_E-Business","222573485_COPLINK_Connect_Information_and_knowledge_management_for_law_enforcement","220605858_Geocomputation_Geodemographics_and_Resource_Allocation_for_Local_Policing","220590980_Knowledge_Management_Strategies_Toward_a_Taxonomy","220260039_Why_Should_I_Share_Examining_Social_Capital_and_Knowledge_Contribution_in_Electronic_Networks_of_Practice","220259877_Effective_Use_of_Knowledge_Management_Systems_A_Process_Model_of_Content_Ratings_and_Credibility_Indicators","200047800_Knowledge_Management_Chalanges_Solutions_and_Technologies","12910982_What's_Your_Strategy_for_Managing_Knowledge"]}
