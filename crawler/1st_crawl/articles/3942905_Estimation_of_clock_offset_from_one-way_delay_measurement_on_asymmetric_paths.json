{"id":"3942905_Estimation_of_clock_offset_from_one-way_delay_measurement_on_asymmetric_paths","abstract":"As the Internet is shifting towards a reliable QoS-aware network,\naccurately synchronized clocks distributed on the Internet are becoming\nmore significant. The network time protocol (NTP) is broadly deployed on\nthe Internet for clock synchronization among distributed hosts, but is\nweak in asymmetric paths, i.e., it cannot accurately estimate the clock\noffset between two hosts when the forward and backward paths between\nthem have different one-way delays. In this paper, we focus on\nestimating the offset and skew of a clock from one-way delay measurement\nbetween two hosts, and propose an idea for improvement of such\nestimations, which reduces estimation errors when the forward and\nbackward paths have different bandwidths, a major factor in asymmetric\ndelays","authors":["Masato Tsuru","Tetsuya Takine","Yuji Oie"],"meta":["February 2002","DOI:10.1109/SAINTW.2002.994563","SourceIEEE Xplore","Conference: Applications and the Internet (SAINT) Workshops, 2002.
