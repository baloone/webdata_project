{"id":"257554880_Bent_and_generalized_bent_Boolean_functions","abstract":"In this paper, we investigate the properties of generalized bent functions defined on \n\n${\\mathbb{Z}_2^n}$\nwith values in \n\n${\\mathbb{Z}_q}$\n, where q ≥ 2 is any positive integer. We characterize the class of generalized bent functions symmetric with respect to two variables, provide analogues of Maiorana–McFarland type bent functions and Dillon’s functions in the generalized set up. A class of bent functions called generalized spreads is introduced and we show that it contains all Dillon type generalized bent functions and Maiorana–McFarland type generalized bent functions. Thus, unification of two different types of generalized bent functions is achieved. The crosscorrelation spectrum of generalized Dillon type bent functions is also characterized. We further characterize generalized bent Boolean functions defined on \n\n${\\mathbb{Z}_2^n}$\nwith values in \n\n${\\mathbb{Z}_4}$\nand \n\n${\\mathbb{Z}_8}$\n. Moreover, we propose several constructions of such generalized bent functions for both n even and n odd.","authors":["Pante Stănică","Thor Martinsen","Sugata Gangopadhyay","Brajesh Kumar Singh"],"meta":["October 2013Designs Codes and Cryptography 69(1)","DOI:10.1007/s10623-012-9622-5"],"references":["243063149_A_Simple_Proof_of_Jacobi's_Four-Square_Theorem","231812171_A_Simple_Proof_of_Jacobi's_Two-Square_Theorem","228720083_Boolean_Functions_for_Cryptography_and_Error_Correcting_Codes","228376361_Vectorial_Boolean_functions_for_cryptography","220738851_Nega-Hadamard_Transform_Bent_and_Negabent_Functions","220334712_Connections_between_Quaternary_and_Binary_Bent_Functions","220333270_Some_Results_Concerning_Generalized_Bent_Functions","49908222_Octal_Bent_Generalized_Boolean_Functions","2138196_On_vanishing_sums_for_roots_of_unity","331627957_Vectorial_Boolean_Functions_for_Cryptography","267078413_Cryptographic_Boolean_Functions_and_Applications","265334005_Elementary_Hadamard_difference_sets","256391988_On_bent_functions","239766079_Investigations_on_Bent_and_Negabent_Functions_via_the_Nega-Hadamard_Transform","224395319_Quaternary_Constant-Amplitude_Codes_for_Multicode_CDMA","224266725_A_characterization_of_binary_bent_functions","222863869_Generalized_Bent_Functions_and_Their_Properties","222366206_On_bent_functions_with_some_symmetric_properties","222034704_On_Vanishing_Sums_of_Roots_of_Unity","220639098_An_Alternate_Characterization_of_the_Bentness_of_Binary_Functions_with_Uniqueness","220638191_On_Boolean_functions_with_the_sum_of_every_two_of_them_being_bent","220301459_Permutation_polynomials_and_applications_to_coding_theory","220074303_A_Characterization_of_Binary_Bent_Functions","36071638_Elementary_hadamard_difference_sets","3078675_Generalized_partial_spreads","2368096_Cross-Correlation_Analysis_of_Cryptographically_Useful_Boolean_Functions_and_S-Boxes"]}
