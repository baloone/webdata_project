{"id":"268806158_Identifying_Multiple_Userids_of_the_Same_Author","abstract":"This paper studies the problem of identifying users who use multiple userids to post in so-cial media. Since multiple userids may belong to the same author, it is hard to directly apply supervised learning to solve the problem. This paper proposes a new method, which still uses supervised learning but does not require train-ing documents from the involved userids. In-stead, it uses documents from other userids for classifier building. The classifier can be applied to documents of the involved userids. This is possible because we transform the document space to a similarity space and learning is performed in this new space. Our evaluation is done in the online review do-main. The experimental results using a large number of userids and their reviews show that the proposed method is highly effective.","authors":["Tieyun Qian","Bing Liu"],"meta":["October 2013","Conference: EMNLP2013"],"references":["303033443_Measuring_the_usefulness_of_function_words_for_authorship_attribution","265579735_Author_Identification_on_the_Large_Scale","265353211_Modality_Specific_Meta_Features_for_Authorship_Attribution_in_Web_Forum_Posts","259979707_Authorship_Attribution_with_Author-aware_Topic_Models","259364013_Segmenting_documents_by_stylistic_character","317662671_Inference_and_Disputed_Authorship_The_Federalist","269762971_Sentiment_Analysis_and_Opinion_Mining","268163044_Distributional_Footprints_of_Deceptive_Product_Reviews","254893781_Outside_the_cave_of_shadows_Using_syntactic_annotation_to_enhance_authorship_attribution","254044417_On_the_Feasibility_of_Internet-Scale_Author_Identification"]}
