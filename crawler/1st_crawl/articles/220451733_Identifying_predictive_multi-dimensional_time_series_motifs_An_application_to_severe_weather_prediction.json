{"id":"220451733_Identifying_predictive_multi-dimensional_time_series_motifs_An_application_to_severe_weather_prediction","abstract":"We introduce an efficient approach to mining multi-dimensional temporal streams of real-world data for ordered temporal motifs\nthat can be used for prediction. Since many of the dimensions of the data are known or suspected to be irrelevant, our approach\nfirst identifies the salient dimensions of the data, then the key temporal motifs within each dimension, and finally the temporal\nordering of the motifs necessary for prediction. For the prediction element, the data are assumed to be labeled. We tested\nthe approach on two real-world data sets. To verify the generality of the approach, we validated the application on several\nsubjects from the CMU Motion Capture database. Our main application uses several hundred numerically simulated supercell thunderstorms\nwhere the goal is to identify the most important features and feature interrelationships which herald the development of strong\nrotation in the lowest altitudes of a storm. We identified sets of precursors, in the form of meteorological quantities reaching\nextreme values in a particular temporal sequence, unique to storms producing strong low-altitude rotation. The eventual goal\nis to use this knowledge for future severe weather detection and prediction algorithms.","authors":["Amy Mcgovern","Derek H. Rosendahl","Rodger A.
