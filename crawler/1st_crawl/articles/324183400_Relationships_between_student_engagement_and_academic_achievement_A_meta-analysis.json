{"id":"324183400_Relationships_between_student_engagement_and_academic_achievement_A_meta-analysis","abstract":"Most scholars have argued that student engagement positively predicts academic achievement, but some have challenged this view. We sought to resolve this debate by offering conclusive evidence through a meta-analysis of 69 independent studies (196,473 participants). The results revealed that (a) there was a moderately strong and positive correlation between overall student engagement and academic achievement, and an analysis of the domains of behavioral, emotional, and cognitive engagement showed that almost all had a positive correlation with studentsâ€™ academic achievement; and (b) a moderator analysis revealed that the relationship between student engagement and academic achievement was influenced by the method of reporting engagement, cultural value, and gender. Furthermore, the relationships of behavioral, emotional, and cognitive engagement with academic achievement were influenced by reporting method for engagement, cultural value, or gender.","authors":["Hao Lei","Yunhuo Cui","Wenye Zhou"],"meta":["March 2018Social Behavior and Personality An International Journal 46(3):517-528","DOI:10.2224/sbp.7054","Project: teacher support and academic emotions"],"references":["319397030_The_relationship_between_aggression_and_self-esteemA_meta-analysis","252740193_Parents'_Relationships_and_Involvement_Effects_on_Students'_School_Engagement_and_Performance","285721417_Relationship_between_junior_students'_gratitude_and_academic_achievement_with_academic_engagement_as_the_mediator","280820290_Student_engagement_in_instructional_activity_Patterns_in_the_elementary_middle_and_high_School_Years","274737415_Sense_of_relatedness_boosts_engagement_achievement_and_well-being_A_latent_growth_model_study","269832846_The_Multidimensionality_of_School_Engagement_and_Math_Achievement_Among_Racial_Groups","262771029_Students'_emotional_and_cognitive_engagement_as_the_determinants_of_well-being_and_achievement_in_school","259137994_Procrastination_and_self-efficacy_Tracing_vicious_and_virtuous_circles_in_self-regulated_learning","254303526_Conceptualizing_Student_Motivation","249797781_School_Engagement_Potential_of_the_Concept_State_of_the_Evidence"]}
