{"id":"320125783_Fractional_Diffusion_Based_Modelling_and_Prediction_of_Human_Brain_Response_to_External_Stimuli","abstract":"Human brain response is the result of the overall ability of the brain in analyzing different internal and external stimuli and thus making the proper decisions. During the last decades scientists have discovered more about this phenomenon and proposed some models based on computational, biological, or neuropsychological methods. Despite some advances in studies related to this area of the brain research, there were fewer efforts which have been done on the mathematical modeling of the human brain response to external stimuli. This research is devoted to the modeling and prediction of the human EEG signal, as an alert state of overall human brain activity monitoring, upon receiving external stimuli, based on fractional diffusion equations. The results of this modeling show very good agreement with the real human EEG signal and thus this model can be used for many types of applications such as prediction of seizure onset in patient with epilepsy.","authors":["Hamidreza Namazi","Vladimir Kulish"],"meta":["May 2015Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine 2015:1-14","DOI:10.1155/2015/148534","Project: multi-disciplinary research projects"],"references":["259276501_Nonequilibrium_Thermodynamics_Transport_and_Rate_Processes_in_Physical_and_Biological_Systems","291765748_Real-time_fMRI_of_cortico-limbic_brain_activity_during_emotional_processing","240372985_Neuromagnetic_brain_responses_evoked_by_pleasant_and_unpleasant_olfactory_stimuli","235410265_The_Fractional_Calculus","233992058_Joah_Joseph_and_Operational_Hydrology","229381760_Auditory_evoked_responses_A_tool_to_assess_the_fetal_neurological_activity","229090122_Phase_lagging_model_of_brain_response_to_external_stimuli-modeling_of_single_action_potential","222500225_A_continuum_theory_of_electro-cortical_activity","220022156_Long-Term_Storage_Capacity_of_Reservoirs","215490060_Uber_Die_Von_Der_Molekularkinetischen_Theorie_Der_Warme_Geforderte_Bewegung_Von_In_Ruhenden_Flussigkeiten_Suspendierten_Teilchen"]}
