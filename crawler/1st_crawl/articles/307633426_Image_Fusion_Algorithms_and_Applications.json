{"id":"307633426_Image_Fusion_Algorithms_and_Applications","abstract":"The growth in the use of sensor technology has led to the demand for image fusion: signal processing techniques that can combine information received from different sensors into a single composite image in an efficient and reliable manner. This book brings together classical and modern algorithms and design architectures, demonstrating through applications how these can be implemented.\n\nImage Fusion: Algorithms and Applications provides a representative collection of the recent advances in research and development in the field of image fusion, demonstrating both spatial domain and transform domain fusion methods including Bayesian methods, statistical approaches, ICA and wavelet domain techniques. It also includes valuable material on image mosaics, remote sensing applications and performance evaluation.\n\nThis book will be an invaluable resource to R&D engineers, academic researchers and system developers requiring the most up-to-date and complete information on image fusion algorithms, design architectures and applications.\n\n- Combines theory and practice to create a unique point of reference\n- Contains contributions from leading experts in this rapidly-developing field\n- Demonstrates potential uses in military, medical and civilian areas","authors":["Tania Stathaki"],"meta":["August 2008","Publisher: Academic PressEditor: Tania StathakiISBN: 978-0123725295"],"references":[]}
