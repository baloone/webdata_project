This problem is aggravated when speaking of a very particular community as the engineering community. It is known that the need to have a greater number of graduates in this area is now detected and due to a series of difficulties this need has not been fully covered. In particular, we would like to present the efforts that have been made since Mathematics Education, from the teaching and learning approach of Mathematics through Modeling and Simulation but above all in these last years of the way in which a group of research professors Latin Americans have decided to contribute from different theoretical perspectives to give elements of answers and educational proposals to this problem. We intend to address in this paper about these three views: the relationship Mathematics and Engineering; the teaching proposal through Modeling and finally on challenges and first actions through the collaboration between different Latin American realities.","authors":["Ruth Rodriguez"],"meta":["October 2017IE Revista de Investigaci√≥n Educativa de la REDIECH 8(15):69-85","DOI:10.33010/ie_rie_rediech.v8i15.55"],"references":[]}
