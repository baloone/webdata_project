{"id":"266475449_Perspectives_on_the_Design_and_Evaluation_of_Adaptive_Web_Based_Learning_Environments","abstract":"Adaptive Web-Based Learning Environments (A-WBLEs) provide mechanisms to individualize instruction (e.g., content, interface, strategies, and assessment) for learners based on their individual differences. In this paper, various adaptive methods influencing the design of AWBLEs are explained and how these methods aim to address individual differences is discussed. Empirical evaluations of adaptive systems are synthesized and four levels for categorizing AWBLEs are created to provide a guideline for future design and development of A-WBLEs .","authors":["Fethi A Inan","Raymond Flores","Michael M.
