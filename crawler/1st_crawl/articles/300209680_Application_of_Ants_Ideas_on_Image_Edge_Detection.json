{"id":"300209680_Application_of_Ants_Ideas_on_Image_Edge_Detection","abstract":"The aim of the image edge detection is to find the points, in a digital image, at which the brightness level changes sharply. Normally they are curved lines called edges. Edge detection is a fundamental tool in image processing, machine vision and computer vision, particularly in the areas of feature detection and feature extraction. Edge detection may lead to finding the boundaries of objects. It is one of the fundamental steps in image analysis. Edge detection is a hard computational problem. In this paper we apply a multiagent system. The idea comes from ant colony optimization. We use the swarm intelligence of the ants to search the image edges.","authors":["Stefka Fidanova","Zlatoliliya Ilcheva"],"meta":["June 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-26520-9_23","Conference: International Conference on Large-Scale Scientific Computing"],"references":["228848216_Image_edge_detection_using_ant_colony_optimization","224377985_A_Computational_Approach_To_Edge_Detection","220176122_Edge_detection_using_ant_algorithms","36146886_Ant_Colony_Optimization","292102365_Digital_Image_Processing","280560337_Ant_Algorithms_for_Adaptive_Edge_Detection","279435075_Gradient_and_Laplacian_Edge_Detection","267113228_Generalized_net_model_for_the_process_of_hybrid_ant_colony_optimization","242616107_The_fundamentals_of_digital_image_processing_prentice-hall","230660832_Ant_Colony_Optimization_and_Swarm_Intelligence_4th_International_Workshop_ANTS_2004","228865618_An_Improved_Canny_Algorithm_for_Edge_Detection","222173240_An_edge_detection_approach_based_on_directional_wavelet_transform","221677990_Fundamental_of_Digital_Image_Processing","200047806_Swarm_Intelligence_-_From_Natural_to_Artificial_Systems","31735099_Digital_Image_Processing_PIKS_Inside_WK_Pratt","4375911_An_Ant_Colony_Optimization_Algorithm_For_Image_Edge_Detection"]}
