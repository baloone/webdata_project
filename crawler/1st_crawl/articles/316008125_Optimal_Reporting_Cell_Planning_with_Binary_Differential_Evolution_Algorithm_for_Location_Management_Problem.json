{"id":"316008125_Optimal_Reporting_Cell_Planning_with_Binary_Differential_Evolution_Algorithm_for_Location_Management_Problem","abstract":"This paper presents binary differential evolution based optimal reporting cell planning (RCP) for location management in wireless cellular networks. The significance of mobile location management (MLM) in wireless communication has evolved drastically due to tremendous rise in the number of mobile users with the constraint of limited bandwidth. The total location management cost involves signaling cost due to location registration and location search and a trade-off between these two gives optimal location management cost. The proposed binary differential evolution (BDE) algorithm is used to determine the optimal reporting cell planning configuration such that the overall mobility management cost is minimized. Evidently, from the simulation result the proposed technique works well for the reference networks in terms of optimal cost and convergence speed. Further the applicability of the BDE is also validated for the realistic network of BSNL (Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited), Odisha.","authors":["Swati Swayamsiddha","Smita Parija","Prasanna Sahu","Sudhansu Sekhar Singh"],"meta":["April 2017International Journal of Intelligent Systems and Applications 9(4):23-31","DOI:10.5815/ijisa.2017.04.03"],"references":[]}
