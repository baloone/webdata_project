{"id":"274730735_Multi-Broadcasting_under_the_SINR_Model","abstract":"We study the multi-broadcast problem in multi-hop wireless networks under the\nSINR model deployed in the 2D Euclidean plane. In multi-broadcast, there are\n$k$ initial rumours, potentially belonging to different nodes, that must be\nforwarded to all $n$ nodes of the network. Furthermore, in each round a node\ncan only transmit a small message that could contain at most one initial rumor\nand $O(\\log n)$ control bits. In order to be successfully delivered to a node,\ntransmissions must satisfy the (Signal-to-Inference-and-Noise-Ratio) SINR\ncondition and have sufficiently strong signal at the receiver. We present\ndeterministic algorithms for multi-broadcast for different settings that\nreflect the different types of knowledge about the topology of the network\navailable to the nodes: (i) the whole network topology (ii) their own\ncoordinates and coordinates of their neighbors (iii) only their own\ncoordinates, and (iv) only their own ids and the ids of their neighbors. For\nthe former two settings, we present solutions that are scalable with respect to\nthe diameter of the network and the polylogarithm of the network size, i.e.,\n$\\log^c n$ for some constant $c> 0$, while the solutions for the latter two\nhave round complexity that is superlinear in the number of nodes. The last\nresult is of special significance, as it is the first result for the SINR model\nthat does not require nodes to know their coordinates in the plane (a very\nspecialized type of knowledge), but intricately exploits the understanding that\nnodes are implanted in the 2D Euclidean plane.","authors":["Sai Praneeth Reddy","Dariusz R.
