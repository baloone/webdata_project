{"id":"4279889_Job_Satisfaction_Evaluation_Using_Fuzzy_Approach","abstract":"Likert-type scale that employs ordinal values to represent linguistics terms has been very popular in the studies on job satisfaction evaluation. In this work, it is argued that the use of ordinal values in Likert scale does not offer the best way in representing the linguistic terms. This paper proposes the use of fuzzy sets to represent linguistic terms in Likert-type scale and employs the technique using fuzzy conjoint method in job satisfaction evaluation. Experimental results show that the analysis using fuzzy conjoint method produced consistent result compared to the analysis using the percentage. However, the fuzzy membership values obtained from fuzzy conjoint method can be used to compare the decisions between criteria used to measure job satisfaction, and hence is very useful in providing additional information for decision-making.","authors":["Khairul A.
