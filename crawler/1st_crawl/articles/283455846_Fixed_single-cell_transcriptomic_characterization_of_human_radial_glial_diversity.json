{"id":"283455846_Fixed_single-cell_transcriptomic_characterization_of_human_radial_glial_diversity","abstract":"The diverse progenitors that give rise to the human neocortex have been difficult to characterize because progenitors, particularly radial glia (RG), are rare and are defined by a combination of intracellular markers, position and morphology. To circumvent these problems, we developed Fixed and Recovered Intact Single-cell RNA (FRISCR), a method for profiling the transcriptomes of individual fixed, stained and sorted cells. Using FRISCR, we profiled primary human RG that constitute only 1% of the midgestation cortex and classified them as ventricular zone-enriched RG (vRG) that express ANXA1 and CRYAB, and outer subventricular zone-localized RG (oRG) that express HOPX. Our study identified vRG and oRG markers and molecular profiles, an essential step for understanding human neocortical progenitor development. FRISCR allows targeted single-cell profiling of any tissues that lack live-cell markers.","authors":["Elliot R Thomsen","John K Mich","Zizhen Yao","Rebecca D Hodge"],"meta":["November 2015Nature Methods 13(1)","DOI:10.1038/nmeth.3629"],"references":["311344449_Smart-seq2_for_sensitive_full-length_transcriptome_profiling_in_single_cells","275525502_GT-seq_Parallel_sequencing_of_single-cell_genomes_and_transcriptomes","334774018_Single-Cell_RNA-Seq_with_Waterfall_Reveals_Molecular_Cascades_underlying_Adult_Neurogenesis","313564485_General_framework_for_weighted_gene_co-expression_network_analysis","311556812_HEART_DEVELOPMENT_Integration_of_Bmp_and_Wnt_signaling_by_Hopx_specifies_commitment_of_cardiomyoblasts","311424207_Ultrafast_and_memory-efficient_alignment_of_short_DNA_sequences_to_the_human_genome","303693440_RSEM_accurate_transcript_quantification_from_RNA-Seq_data_with_or_without_a_reference_genome_BMC_Bioinform_12323","283193219_Molecular_Identity_of_Human_Outer_Radial_Glia_During_Cortical_Development","281298083_Ultrafast_and_memory-efficient_alignment_of_short_DNA_sequences_to_the_human_genome","279302021_HEART_DEVELOPMENT_Integration_of_Bmp_and_Wnt_signaling_by_Hopx_specifies_commitment_of_cardiomyoblasts","273152996_Single-cell_analysis_reveals_transcriptional_heterogeneity_of_neural_progenitors_in_human_cortex","272819791_Human-specific_gene_ARHGAP11B_promotes_basal_progenitor_amplification_and_neocortex_expansion","273033225_Unique_Morphological_Features_of_the_Proliferative_Zones_and_Postmitotic_Compartments_of_the_Neural_Epithelium_Giving_Rise_to_Striate_and_Extrastriate_Cortex_in_the_Monkey","272516918_The_Outer_Subventricular_Zone_and_Primate-Specific_Cortical_Complexification","270653183_DeCoN_Genome-wide_Analysis_of_In_Vivo_Transcriptional_Dynamics_during_Pyramidal_Neuron_Fate_Selection_in_Neocortex"]}
