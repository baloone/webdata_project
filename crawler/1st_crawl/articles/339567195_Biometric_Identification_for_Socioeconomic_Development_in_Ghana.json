{"id":"339567195_Biometric_Identification_for_Socioeconomic_Development_in_Ghana","abstract":"This paper draws on interpretive case study methodology and e-government enactment framework to understand Ghana’s biometric identification initiative implementation and its failure to achieve the intended socioeconomic development impacts. To better understand how such initiatives can be deployed to achieve the desired impacts, the findings on the reasons for the failed Ghana’s case are compared with that of a successful developing country’s case. The study offers contributions to research, policy and practice.","authors":["John Effah","Emmanuel Owusu-Oware","Richard Boateng"],"meta":["February 2020Information Systems Management 37(10)","DOI:10.1080/10580530.2020.1732528"],"references":["303818590_Policy_arena_Do_information_and_communication_technologies_icts_contribute_to_development","281091531_An_Inclusive_Value_Sensitive_Design_Perspective_on_Future_Identity_Technologies","262402793_E-Government_in_Africa_Promise_and_practice","261360226_Biometrics_and_Identity_Management_for_Homeland_Security_Applications_in_Saudi_Arabia","260789844_Challenges_to_the_Successful_Implementation_of_e-Government_Initiatives_in_Sub-Saharan_Africa_A_Literature_Review","235254120_E-government_adoption_Architecture_and_barriers","222403049_E-Government_in_developing_countries_Experiences_from_sub-Saharan_Africa","221561081_The_Bangladesh_National_Biometric_Database_A_Transferable_Success","220580437_Information_Flow_Impediments_in_Disaster_Relief_Supply_Chains","220260372_Qualitative_Research_in_Information_Systems","220175139_Information_Systems_and_Developing_Countries_Failure_Success_and_Local_Improvisations","46508652_Do_Information_and_Communication_Technologies_ICTs_contribute_to_development_Journal_of_International_Development_22_625-640","45163280_Information_systems_in_the_public_sector_The_e-Government_enactment_framework","3226826_Building_the_virtual_state_-_Book_Review","339997052_eGovernment_in_Africa_Promise_and_Practice","326722691_Institutional_Enablers_and_Constraints_of_National_Biometric_Identification_Implementation_in_Developing_Countries_The_Case_of_Ghana","323647230_Biometric_technology_for_voter_identification_The_experience_in_Ghana","316856490_ACM_Transactions_on_Computer-Human_Interaction_TOCHI","315497736_Enacting_Electronic_Government_Success","310786394_Conceptualizing_and_Researching_the_Adoption_of_ICT_and_the_Impact_on_Socioeconomic_Development","307441472_A_garbage_can_model_of_government_IT_project_failures_in_developing_countries_The_effects_of_leadership_decision_structure_and_team_competence","304953415_Identity_Verification_and_Societal_Challenges_Explaining_the_Gap_Between_Service_Provision_and_Development_Outcomes","290606860_Factors_Influencing_The_Success_Of_E-Government","287588198_ICT_Barriers_and_Critical_Success_Factors_in_Developing_Countries","277700248_Encyclopedia_of_Statistics_in_Behavioral_Science","256050006_Identification_for_Development_The_Biometrics_Revolution","236144326_Qualitative_Research_in_Business_Management","228580317_E-Government_for_Developing_Countries_Opportunities_and_Challenges","228552704_Recognising_Alternative_Rationalities_in_the_Deployment_of_Information_Systems","228349603_ICTs_for_the_Broader_Development_of_India_An_Analysis_of_the_Literature","228346461_The_Failure_of_E-Government_in_Developing_Countries_A_Literature_Review","226257277_A_Comparative_Study_of_Contents_of_E-government_Service_Websites_of_Middle_East_and_North_African_MENA_Countries","224952197_Theory_Building_From_Cases_Opportunities_And_Challenges","222743159_Biometrics_is_it_a_viable_proposition_for_identity_authentication_and_access_control","222428806_The_Qualitative_Interview_in_IS_Research_Examining_the_Craft","220892480_Icts_and_Sustainable_Development_a_Capability_Perspective","220437137_The_Internet_and_socio-economic_development_Exploring_the_interaction","220393303_Doing_Interpretive_Research","220259991_A_Set_of_Principles_for_Conducting_and_Evaluating_Interpretive_Field_Studies_in_Information_Systems","220220804_Information_Systems_in_Developing_Countries_A_Critical_Research_Review","46277558_Global_Identity_Policies_and_Technology_Do_we_Understand_the_Question","45579197_Legal_Issues_for_E-Government_in_Developing_Countries","32018735_Interpretive_Case_Studies_in_IS_Research_Nature_and_Method","2318118_Social_Implications_of_Information_and_Communication_Technology_in_Developing_Countries_Lessons_from_Asian_Success_Stories"]}
