{"id":"331292630_The_Nanodiffraction_beamline_ID01ESRF_a_microscope_for_imaging_strain_and_structure","abstract":"The ID01 beamline has been built to combine Bragg diffraction with imaging techniques to produce a strain and mosaicity microscope for materials in their native or operando state. A scanning probe with nano-focused beams, objective-lens-based full-field microscopy and coherent diffraction imaging provide a suite of tools which deliver micrometre to few nanometre spatial resolution combined with 10 ⁻⁵ strain and 10 ⁻³ tilt sensitivity. A detailed description of the beamline from source to sample is provided and serves as a reference for the user community. The anticipated impact of the impending upgrade to the ESRF – Extremely Brilliant Source is also discussed.","authors":["Steven J.
