{"id":"223529096_Edge_dominating_set_and_colorings_on_graphs_with_fixed_clique-width","abstract":"We consider both the vertex and the edge versions of three graph partitioning problems. These problems are dominating set, list-q-coloring with costs (fixed number of colors q) and chromatic number. They are all known to be NP-hard in general. We show that all these problems (except edge-coloring) can be solved in polynomial time on graphs with clique-width bounded by some constant k, if the k-expression of the input graph is also given. In particular, we present the first polynomial algorithms (on these classes) for chromatic number, edge-dominating set and list-q-coloring with costs (fixed number of colors q, both vertex and edge versions). For the two list-q-coloring problems with costs, we even have linear algorithms. Since these classes of graphs include classes like P4-sparse graphs, distance hereditary graphs and graphs with bounded treewidth, our algorithms also apply to these graphs.","authors":["Daniel Kobler","Udi Rotics"],"meta":["March 2003Discrete Applied Mathematics 126(2-3):197-221","DOI:10.1016/S0166-218X(02)00198-1","SourceDBLP"],"references":["226017874_Linear_Time_Solvable_Optimization_Problems_on_Graphs_of_Bounded_Clique_Width","223067838_Handle-rewriting_hypergraph_grammars","220544642_Linear_Time_Solvable_Optimization_Problems_on_Graphs_of_Bounded_Clique-Width","220181029_On_the_Clique-Width_of_Some_Perfect_Graph_Classes","220180873_On_the_Clique-Width_of_Graphs_with_Few_P","2303056_On_the_Clique-Width_of_Graphs_with_Few_P_4_s","280688730_Algorithms_for_vertex_partitioning_problems_on_partial_-trees","268609467_On_n-domination_n-dependence_and_forbidden_subgraphs","265425875_Choosability_in_Graphs","262369764_n-Domination_in_graphs","247204972_Polynomial_algorithms_for_partitioning_problems_on_graphs_with_fixed_clique-width","225502220_Generalized_coloring_for_tree-like_graphs","223636646_NP-completeness_of_edge-colouring_some_restricted_graphs","222453029_k-NLC_graphs_and_polynomial_algorithms","222357668_Some_results_concerning_the_complexity_of_restricted_colorings_of_graphs","222296805_Upper_Bounds_to_the_Clique-Width_of_Graphs","222227545_Restrictions_and_preassignments_in_preemptive_open_shop_scheduling","221558239_Logical_Definability_of_NP-Optimization_Problems_with_Monadic_Auxiliary_Predicates","220980376_Polynomial_Time_Recognition_of_Clique-Width_le_leq_3_Graphs_Extended_Abstract","220780501_Polynomial_algorithms_for_partitioning_problems_on_graphs_with_fixed_clique-width_extended_abstract","220695890_Computers_and_Intracdtability_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness","220617300_The_NP-Completeness_of_Edge-Coloring","220570621_T-choosability_in_Graphs","220567158_On_the_fixed_parameter_complexity_of_graph_enumeration_problems_definable_in_monadic_second-order_logic","220192155_Feasible_edge_colorings_of_trees_with_cardinality_constraints","220153387_Algorithms_for_vertex-partitioning_problems_on_graphs_with_fixed_clique-width","3225367_Finding_a_Maximum_Planar_Subset_of_a_Set_of_Nets_in_a_Channel","2455433_Clique-Decomposition_NLC-Decomposition_and_Modular_Decomposition_-_Relationships_and_Results_for_Random_Graphs","2412192_Algorithms_For_Vertex_Partitioning_Problems_On_Partial_k-Trees","2360391_Graph_colorings_with_local_constraints_-_A_survey","2322910_Complexity_Results_for_the_Optimum_Cost_Chromatic_Partition_Problem","2250874_On_the_Fixed_Parameter_Complexity_of_Graph_Enumeration_Problems_Definable_in_Monadic_Second_Order_Logic"]}
