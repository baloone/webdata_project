Its real life applications are particularly associated with tourist trip planning in transport networks, where travel time between two points depends on the moment of travel start. In the paper an effective TDOPTW solution (evolutionary algorithm with local search operators) was presented and applied to generate attractive tours in real public transport networks of Bia≈Çystok and Athens. The method achieved very high-quality solutions in a short execution time.","authors":["Krzysztof Ostrowski"],"meta":["November 2018","DOI:10.23743/acs-2018-09"],"references":["305782992_Evolution-inspired_local_improvement_algorithm_solving_orienteering_problem_full_text_on_site_httprdcubennFT","299584245_PARAMETERS_TUNING_OF_EVOLUTIONARY_ALGORITHM_FOR_THE_ORIENTEERING_PROBLEM","276119658_Heuristics_for_the_time_dependent_team_orienteering_problem_Application_to_tourist_route_planning","267875936_GRASP_with_path_relinking_for_the_orienteering_problem","317235982_Evolutionary_Algorithm_for_the_Time-Dependent_Orienteering_Problem","313062558_A_genetic_algorithm_with_an_adaptive_penalty_function_for_the_orienteering_problem","260947666_A_fast_solution_method_for_the_time-dependent_orienteering_problem","237133260_Shortest_Paths_in_FIFO_Time-Dependent_Networks_Theory_and_Algorithms","229341673_Integrating_public_transportation_in_personalised_electronic_tourist_guides","223564230_A_guided_local_search_metaheuristic_for_the_team_orienteering_problem"]}
