{"id":"345318324_Circular_Intensely_Orthogonal_Double_Cover_Design_of_Balanced_Complete_Multipartite_Graphs","abstract":"In this paper, we generalize the orthogonal double covers (ODC) of Kn,n as follows. The circular intensely orthogonal double cover design (CIODCD) of X=Kn,n,…,n︸m is defined as a collection T={G00,G10,…,G(n−1)0}∪{G01,G11,…,G(n−1)1} of isomorphic spanning subgraphs of X such that every edge of X appears twice in the collection T,E(Gi0)∩E(Gj0)=E(Gi1)∩E(Gj1)=0,i≠jand E(Gi0)∩E(Gj1)=λ=m2,i,j∈ℤn. We define the half starters and the symmetric starters matrices as constructing methods for the CIODCD of X. Then, we introduce some results as a direct application to the construction of CIODCD of X by the symmetric starters matrices.","authors":["Mahmoud Higazy","Ahmed El-Mesady","Emad E.
