{"id":"267798560_THE_REASONING_PROCESSES_FOR_SELECTING_TEACHING_PRACTICES_FOR_STUDENTS_WITH_IMPAIRMENTS","abstract":"In this paper we show two SWRL enabled OWL models which allow reasoning for the purpose of determining which teaching practices are suitable for students with various impairments, when trying to achieve learning goals. We use the same basic OWL model which describes the semantic of the environment where teaching of pupils with impairments takes place. However, the models differ because they have different ways of creating constraints and the reasoning process upon the OWL ontological classes and their individuals. They may also have different implications on applications built upon these models. The paper discusses these differences and highlights their advantages and limitations.","authors":["Eiman Sayedalamin Almami","Radmila Juric","M.
