{"id":"260504049_Electromagnetic_Scattering_From_3-D_Targets_in_a_Random_Medium_Using_Finite_Difference_Frequency_Domain","abstract":"In this paper a three-dimensional (3-D) numerical technique based on the finite difference frequency domain (FDFD) is implemented to calculate the scattering from arbitrary shaped objects embedded in a continuous random medium. The total field/scattered field (TF/SF) algorithm is integrated with the FDFD to minimize the memory consumption and speed up the calculations. For validation purposes, the radar cross-section of a 2-D conducting cylinder in random medium is calculated using the FDFD technique and compared to previously published data based on the current generator method. An upgrade to a 3-D solver was then inspired once the idea of using the multi-grid technique was introduced to accelerate the convergence rate of the BICGSTAB iterative solver. Thus, allowing the FDFD technique to become a robust method to solve the scattering problem from large targets embedded in random medium. Therefore, using the introduced simulating scheme, one can easily elucidate any scattering information out of real life targets surrounded by random environmental effects.","authors":["Mohamed Al Sharkawy","Hosam El-Ocla"],"meta":["November 2013IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation 61(11):5621-5626","DOI:10.1109/TAP.2013.2277511"],"references":["245440173_Numerical_Analysis_of_Some_Scattering_Problems_in_Continuous_Random_Medium","230872944_Multi-Grid_Methods_and_Applications","312920268_Multi-level_adaptive_technique_MLAT_for_fast_numerical_solution_to_boundary_value_problems","293694613_Multi-gird_technique_for_solving_two_dimensional_quasi-static_electromagnetic_structures","272592235_Introduction_to_multigrid_using_matlab","253644511_Numerical_Scattering_from_3D_Randomly_Rough_Surfaces_using_FVTD","243404487_Radar_cross_sections_of_conducting_elliptic_cylinders_embedded_in_strong_continuous_random_media","239666970_The_Scattering_of_Light_and_Other_Electromagnetic_Radiation_Academic","238962044_Backscattering_enhancement_for_partially_convex_targets_of_large_sizes_in_continuous_random_media_for_E-wave_incidence","225444903_Multi-Level_Adaptive_Technique_MLAT_for_Fast_Numerical_Solution_to_Boundary_Value_Problems","220517920_Estimation_of_Specific_Differential_Phase_and_Differential_Backscatter_Phase_From_Polarimetric_Weather_Radar_Measurements_of_Rain","215514388_A_Perfect_Matched_Layer_for_the_Absorption_of_Electromagnetic_Waves","44396740_The_Scattering_of_Light_and_Other_Electro-Magnetic_Radiation","6949235_Laser_backscattered_from_partially_convex_targets_of_large_sizes_in_random_media_for_E-wave_polarization","3854750_Fast_power_grid_simulation","3202799_Finite-difference_time-domain_simulation_of_scattering_from_objects_in_continuous_random_media","3202755_Scattering_from_lossy_dielectric_objects_buried_beneath_randomly_rough_ground_Validating_the_semi-analytic_mode_matching_algorithm_with_2-D_FDFD","3201679_Ultra-wideband_short-pulse_ground-penetrating_radar_Simulation_and_measurement","3018498_Plane_Wave_Scattering_From_Three_Dimensional_Multiple_Objects_Using_the_Iterative_Multiregion_Technique_Based_on_the_FDFD_Method","3011557_Efficient_modeling_of_infinite_scatterers_using_a_generalized_total-fieldscattered-field_FDTD_boundary_partially_embedded_within_PML","3007797_Complex_Ray_Interpretation_of_Reflection_from_Concave-Convex_Surfaces","2551130_Fast_Power_Grid_Simulation"]}
