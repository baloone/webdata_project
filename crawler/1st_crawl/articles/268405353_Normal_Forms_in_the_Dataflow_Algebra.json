{"id":"268405353_Normal_Forms_in_the_Dataflow_Algebra","abstract":"Previously a version of the abstract syntax for the dataflow algebra has been defined that is based on a simpler and more appropriate model of the underlying semantic domain than the one used in the original definition of the algebra. Also, corresponding to this simplified abstract syntax a denotational semantics for the algebra has been presented, and an operational semantics. This report considers structural forms for elements of the algebra that correspond to the models used in these semantics, and that can be regarded as normal forms for the algebra. After reviewing the concept of normal forms, as derived from term rewriting systems, the inherent properties of these various forms are explored, in three groups. Firstly, a reduced form derived from earlier work is reviewed, in order to correct an error in the earlier definition of it. Secondly, forms based on the structures used in the denotational semantics are developed, and thirdly forms based on the structures used in the operational semantics. The intention is that these forms should provide a basis for reasoning about situations where the equality or inequality of elements of the algebra is significant, although showing that they achieve this is beyond the scope of this report.","authors":["A J Cowling"],"meta":[],"references":["246701183_Linking_Dataflow_Algebra_with_the_CaDiZ_tool","266462911_A_Revised_Denotational_Semantics_for_the_Dataflow_Algebra","245839576_Dataflow_Algebras_as_Formal_Specifications_of_Data_Flows","242427043_Using_Dataflow_Algebra_as_a_Specification_Method","242427042_An_Operational_Semantics_for_the_Dataflow_Algebra","242426966_A_Simplified_Abstract_Syntax_for_the_Dataflow_Algebra","224001303_The_Z_Notation_a_Reference_Manual","2712723_Rewrite_Systems"]}
