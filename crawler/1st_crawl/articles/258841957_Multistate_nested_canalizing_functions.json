{"id":"258841957_Multistate_nested_canalizing_functions","abstract":"The concept of a nested canalizing Boolean function has been studied\nover the course of the last decade in the context of understanding the\nregulatory logic of molecular interaction networks, such as gene\nregulatory networks. Such functions appear preferentially in published\nmodels of such networks. Recently, this concept has been generalized to\ninclude multi-state functions, and a recursive formula has been derived\nfor their number, as a function of the number of variables. This paper\ncarries out a detailed analysis of the class of nested canalizing\nfunctions over an arbitrary finite field. Furthermore, the paper\ngeneralizes the concept further, and derives a closed formula for the\nnumber of such generalized functions. The paper also derives a closed\nformula for the number of equivalence classes under permutation of\nvariables. This is motivated by the fact that two nested canalizing\nfunctions that differ by a permutation of the variables share many\nimportant properties with each other. The paper contributes to the\neffort of identifying a class of functions over finite fields that are\nof interest in biology and also have interesting mathematical\nproperties.","authors":["John O.
