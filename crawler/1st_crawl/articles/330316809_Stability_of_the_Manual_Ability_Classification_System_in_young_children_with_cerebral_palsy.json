Children were classified at 18 months (n=70), 24 months (n=131), 30 months (n=173), 36 months (n=209), 48 months (n=226), and 60 months (n=221) of age. Stability of the MACS was examined using the proportion of specific positive agreement and transition proportions, which are measures of agreement.\n\nResults\nThere were 1030 unique observations, with each of the 252 participants seen between two and six occasions (median=4). Average specific positive agreement over the study period was 76% for MACS level I, 67% for level II, 50% for level III, 51% for level IV, and 83% for level V. MACS levels I and V have the highest degree of stability, while levels III and IV have the lowest. We show how this may be explained by the proportion of children in each MACS level.\n\nInterpretation\nUsing measures of agreement rather than measures of reliability provides accurate information when measuring stability over time of an ordinal classification system. The relative stability of MACS levels can be explained by the proportion of children in each level.","authors":["Andrea Burgess","Roslyn Boyd","Jenny Ziviani","Mark D Chatfield"],"meta":["January 2019Developmental Medicine & Child Neurology 61(7)","DOI:10.1111/dmcn.14143"],"references":["328140815_Self-care_and_manual_ability_in_preschool_children_with_cerebral_palsy_a_longitudinal_study","318418829_PREDICT-CP_Study_protocol_of_implementation_of_comprehensive_surveillance_to_predict_outcomes_for_school-aged_children_with_cerebral_palsy","303868682_Mini-MACS_Development_of_the_Manual_Ability_Classification_System_for_children_younger_than_4_years_of_age_with_signs_of_cerebral_palsy","285476231_The_definition_and_classification_of_cerebral_palsy","281210610_A_report_The_definition_and_classification_of_cerebral_palsy","262190385_Classification_in_Childhood_Disability_Focusing_on_Function_in_the_21st_Century","259718795_The_stability_of_the_Manual_Ability_Classification_System_over_time","243757020_Improving_the_Use_of_Hands_in_Daily_Activities","324945727_Stability_of_the_Gross_Motor_Function_Classification_System_Manual_Ability_Classification_System_and_Communication_Function_Classification_System","312339477_Specific_agreement_on_dichotomous_outcomes_in_the_situation_of_more_than_two_raters"]}
