{"id":"248966314_Self-assessment_in_higher_education_Experience_in_using_a_metacognitive_approach_in_five_case_studies","abstract":"This study describes the use of a metacognitive approach for self‐assessment of teacher education students. The design of the study was guided by the principles of learning‐oriented assessment and the centrality of reflection for teachers. The study comprised five case studies undertaken in five teacher education programmes. In each programme, students self‐assessed at the beginning, middle and end of learning. Subgroups of students were invited to represent their learning using concept maps and were interviewed on their progression in self‐assessment. Analysis indicated that students found the metacognitive approach supportive of their learning and self‐assessment. Students were more aware of their learning and thinking processes at the end of the study. Further, teachers involved in the project found the method demanding yet generating useful feedback which enhanced their teaching.","authors":["Magdalena Mo Ching Mok","Ching Leung Lung","Doris pui-wah Cheng","Rebecca Hun Ping Cheung"],"meta":["August 2006Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education 31(4):415-433","DOI:10.1080/02602930600679100"],"references":["243774262_Feedback_and_Self-Regulated_Learning_A_Theoretical_Synthesis","239969990_Enhancing_Learning_Through_Self-Assessment","238310944_Self-regulatory_processes_during_computer_skill_acquisition_Goal_and_self-evaluative_influences","229067947_Self-Regulatory_Process_During_Computer_Skill_Acquisition_Goal_and_Self-Evaluative_Influences","228341442_Learning-oriented_assessment_A_technology-based_case_study","288941461_Implementing_student_self_assessment","284656872_K-W-L_plus_A_strategy_for_comprehension_and_summarization","249797832_Student_Self-Assessment_in_Higher_Education_A_Meta-Analysis","247522582_Classroom_Applications_of_Research_on_Self-Regulated_Learning","246597223_K-W-L_A_Teaching_Model_That_Develops_Active_Reading_of_Expository_Text","234774749_Creativity_Intelligence_and_Problem_Solving_A_Definition_and_Design_for_Cross-Cultural_Research_and_Measurement_Related_to_Giftedness","234753443_Launching_into_Improved_Comprehension_Integrating_the_KWL_Model_into_Middle_Level_Courses","234744072_Self-Directed_Learning_Emerging_Theory_Practice","234569686_Creating_Success_in_the_Classroom_Visual_Organizers_and_How_To_Use_Them","233896779_The_teaching_of_learning_strategies","233207348_Theory_and_Practice_Designing_and_implementing_coachingmentoring_competencies_a_case_study","233067274_Assessment_and_Classroom_Learning","227262998_Quantitative_studies_of_student_self-assessment_in_higher_education_A_critical_analysis_of_findings","44561699_Evaluating_the_Quality_of_Learning_the_SOLO_Taxonomy","27483504_Assessing_the_structure_of_learning_outcomes_from_counselling_using_the_SOLO_taxonomy_An_exploratory_study","10978459_Developing_deep_learning_approaches_and_personal_teaching_efficacy_within_a_preservice_education_context"]}
