{"id":"313569115_Image_segmentation_applied_to_micrographs_of_microcellular_plastics","abstract":"The paper is proposing the use of a method of image segmentation to the study of microcellular plastics. The segmentation is based on a thresholding which creates a binary (black and white) image of the micrograph. The binary image is divided in super-pixels which correspond to the microcells of the material. From the areas of the super-pixels it is easy to evaluate the size of the cells.","authors":["Amelia Carolina Sparavigna"],"meta":["February 2017","Project: Image Segmentation"],"references":["315458349_The_Tsallis_Entropy_and_the_Segmentation_of_Images","311737982_Analysis_of_a_natural_honeycomb_by_means_of_an_image_segmentation","311430540_A_method_for_the_segmentation_of_images_based_on_thresholding_and_applied_to_vesicular_textures","308539246_Analysis_and_Visualization_of_2D_and_3D_Grain_and_Pore_Size_ofFontainebleau_Sandstone_Using_Digital_Rock_Physics","304192755_The_hexagonal_shape_of_the_honeycomb_cells_depends_on_the_construction_behavior_of_bees","298148604_Reproductive_strategies_of_the_mite_Varroa_jacobsoni_Mesostigmata_Varroidae_Influence_of_larva_type_ahd_comb_cell_size_on_honey_bee_brood_infestation_rates","281415480_Tsallis_Entropy_In_Bi-level_And_Multi-level_Image_Thresholding","313575668_Statistical_and_structural_approaches_to_texture","309697299_Maximum_entropy_method_in_image_processing","273343814_Effect_of_Comb_Size_on_Population_Growth_of_Honey_Bee_Hymenoptera_Apidae_Colonies"]}
