{"id":"319507036_Developing_the_Ultimate_Course_Search_Tool_A_Pilot_Study","abstract":"Security IT professionals are in high demand, yet university computer science programs have low retention rates. In an effort to increase retention of these millennial students, universities should provide interactive, individualized, student controlled learning. Ultimate Course Search (UCS) was developed to provide an interactive content search learning tool for students. A pilot study was conducted to determine attrition rates, how students use UCS and integrate learning preferences into studying, and the learning outcomes. The retention rates of the experimental class were much higher than that of the control class. Student comments of UCS are discussed.","authors":["Edina Renfro-Michel","Sailume Walo-Roberts"],"meta":["January 2017","Project: NSF iSecure"],"references":["292219181_The_intergenerational_workforce_revisited","279894244_Applications_reliability_and_validity_of_the_Index_of_Learning_Styles","250145509_Best_Practices_in_Predicting_and_Encouraging_Student_Persistence_and_Achievement_Online","234715154_Welcoming_a_New_Generation_to_College_The_Millennial_Students","354333631_Shedding_Light_on_Students'_Technology_Preferences_Implications_for_Academic_Development","292937634_STEM_attrition_College_students'_paths_into_and_out_of_STEM_fields","259765309_Effective_Classroom_Teaching_Methods_A_Critical_Incident_Technique_from_Millennial_Nursing_Students'_Perspective","247923275_The_Kolb_learning_style_inventory_version_3","247728858_Attempted_Validation_of_the_Scores_of_the_VARK_Learning_Styles_Inventory_With_Multitrait-Multimethod_Confirmatory_Factor_Analysis_Models","246457089_Index_of_Learning_Styles","221790442_Twelve_tips_for_facilitating_Millennials'_learning","220613236_Why_the_high_attrition_rate_for_computer_science_students_Some_thoughts_and_observations","228341045_Working_with_Generation-D_Adopting_and_adapting_to_cultural_learning_and_change"]}
