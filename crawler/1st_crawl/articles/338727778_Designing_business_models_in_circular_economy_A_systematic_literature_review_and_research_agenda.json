{"id":"338727778_Designing_business_models_in_circular_economy_A_systematic_literature_review_and_research_agenda","abstract":"The concept of circular economy is increasingly receiving attention in different domains, including strategic management, operations management, and technology management. It requires companies to design their business model (i.e., the value network, the relationships with the supply chain partners, and the value propositions towards customers) around a new concept of sustainable development that reduces consumption of natural resources and preserves the environment. However, extant research falls short in terms of explaining how companies design their business model according to the circular economy principles. Starting from this premise, the present paper provides a systematic review of the literature on the design of business models in the context of circular economy, aiming to offer an overview of the state of research and outline a promising research agenda.","authors":["Piera Centobelli","Roberto Cerchione","Davide Chiaroni","Pasquale Del Vecchio"],"meta":["January 2020Business Strategy and the
