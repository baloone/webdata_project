{"id":"332816700_Logic-based_methodology_to_help_security_architects_in_eliciting_high-level_network_security_requirements","abstract":"In this paper¹, we propose a security methodology that automates the process of security zone specification and high-level network security requirements elicitation. We define a set of formalized rules derived from the principles of complete mediation, least privileges and the Clark-Wilson lite formal model making our approach traceable and verifiable. We implemented the methodology in Answer Set Programming to automatically compute an optimal network security zone model considering the cost of the security solution. A use case study of an e-commerce enterprise network infrastructure illustrates our methodology.","authors":["Romain Laborde","Sravani Teja Bulusu","Ahmad Samer Wazan","François Barrère"],"meta":["April 2019","DOI:10.1145/3297280.3297437","Conference: the 34th ACM/SIGAPP Symposium"],"references":["326162236_Applying_a_requirement_engineering_based_approach_to_evaluate_the_security_requirements_engineering_methodologies","324502807_A_Requirements_Engineering-Based_Approach_for_Evaluating_Security_Requirements_Engineering_Methodologies","319047875_Which_Security_Requirements_Engineering_Methodology_Should_I_Choose_Towards_a_Requirements_Engineering-based_Evaluation_Approach","276005972_Answer_Set_Solving_in_Practice","235043659_Integrity_Considerations_for_Secure_Computer_Systems","225740605_Implementation_of_a_Formal_Security_Policy_Refinement_Process_in_WBEM_Architecture","221430462_Implementation_of_a_formal_security_policy_refinement_process_in_WBEM_architecture","321741900_Further_refinements_to_the_foundations_of_cyber_zone_defense","295863515_Security_Requirements_Engineering_Designing_Secure_Socio-Technical_Systems","273161737_P2CySeMoL_Predictive_Probabilistic_Cyber_Security_Modeling_Language","262169162_Toward_authorization_as_a_service_a_study_of_the_XACML_standard","234775191_Security_Engineering_A_Guide_to_Building_Dependable_Distributed_Systems","228697704_Towards_automated_identification_of_security_zone_classification_in_enterprise_networks","221655412_Toward_Automated_Information-Flow_Integrity_Verification_for_Security-Critical_Applications","221147718_DALculus_-_Theory_and_Tool_for_Development_Assurance_Level_Allocation","220713836_A_Comparison_of_Commercial_and_Military_Computer_Security_Policies","2994185_The_Protection_of_Information_in_Computer_Systems"]}
