{"id":"344158836_Global_Forecasting_Confirmed_and_Fatal_Cases_of_COVID-19_Outbreak_Using_Autoregressive_Integrated_Moving_Average_Model","abstract":"The world health organization (WHO) formally proclaimed the Coronavirus, called COVID-19 episode a worldwide pandemic on 11 March 2020. In December 2019 COVID-19 was found in Wuhan city, China, and now coronavirus has spread over various nations as the flare-up has now spread to 198+ nations. All out contaminations outside of China are quickening exponentially, with the worldwide disease cost outperforming 250,000+ as of 18 March 2020, with Asia's commitment at more than 81,000. The Proposed model is using time series analysis to forecast the outbreak of COVID-19 in the world in upcoming days by using an autoregressive integrated moving average(ARIMA).Data has been taken from 1 February 2020 to 1 April 2020 and the outcome showed good performance, around 120000 confirmed fatalities cases has been forecasted using ARIMA model till 1 April 2020 apart from that we have evaluated total confirmed cases, total fatalities cases, autocorrelation function and white noise time-series for both confirmed and fatalities case of COVID-19 outbreak.","authors":["Debabrata Dansana","Raghvendra Kumar","Janmejoy Das Adhikari","Manas Mohapatra"],"meta":["August 2020Frontiers in Public Health","DOI:10.3389/fpubh.2020.580327"],"references":["341736052_Analysis_of_Outbreak_and_Global_Impacts_of_the_COVID-19","341184313_Extended_SIR_Prediction_of_the_Epidemics_Trend_of_COVID-19_in_Italy_and_Compared_With_Hunan_China","340003263_Expected_impact_of_COVID-19_outbreak_in_a_major_metropolitan_area_in_Brazil","339343754_2019_Novel_coronavirus_where_we_are_and_what_we_know","339137601_Clinical_characteristics_of_2019_novel_coronavirus_infection_in_China","338810430_A_familial_cluster_of_pneumonia_associated_with_the_2019_novel_coronavirus_indicating_person-to-person_transmission_a_study_of_a_family_cluster","338754550_Coronaviruses_genome_structure_replication_and_pathogenesis","341758505_Time_Series_Analysis_and_Forecast_of_the_COVID-19_Pandemic_in_India_using_Genetic_Programming","340068588_Extended_SIR_prediction_of_the_epidemics_trend_of_COVID-19_in_Italy_and_compared_with_Hunan_China","338933612_Genomic_characterisation_and_epidemiology_of_2019_novel_coronavirus_implications_for_virus_origins_and_receptor_binding"]}
