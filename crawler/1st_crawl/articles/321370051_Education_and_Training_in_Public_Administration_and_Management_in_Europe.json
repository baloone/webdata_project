{"id":"321370051_Education_and_Training_in_Public_Administration_and_Management_in_Europe","abstract":"This chapter provides an overview of education and training programs in the broader field of Public Administration and Management in Europe. The trends and developments over time and across nation states are studied with particular attention to institutional arrangements of programs, their contents, and curricular developments as well as their teaching philosophies. Along three major dimensions (openness, sequentiality, and academization) the authors analyze academic degree programs as well as programs of government schools and academies. While several converging trends can be identified, e.g., with regard to commonalities of institutional patterns and program content, divergent forces—such as traditional recruitment patterns and teaching styles—are still at work. More recently, traditional ‘internal’ civil service training seems to have given way to more academic and ‘open’ programs.","authors":["Christoph Reichard","Eckhard Schröter"],"meta":["November 2017","DOI:10.1057/978-1-137-55269-3_3","In book: The Palgrave Handbook of Public Administration and Management in Europe (pp.41-60)"],"references":["304882551_Civil_Service_Systems_in_Western_Europe_A_Comparative_Analysis","279561661_Diversity_and_Convergence_A_Quantitative_Analysis_of_European_Public_Administration_Education_Programs","273557523_Public_Administration_Education_in_Europe_Continuity_or_Reorientation","269478772_Responding_to_Challenge_Comparing_Nonprofit_Programmes_and_Pedagogy_at_Universities_in_the_United_Kingdom_Spain_and_the_United_States","265192972_3_Contrasting_Anglo-American_and_Continental_European_civil_service_systems","265074823_Teaching_Ideas_and_Principles_of_Public_Administration_is_it_possible_to_achieve_a_common_European_perspective","258567813_Teaching_and_learning_reflection_in_MPA_programs_Towards_a_strategy","254349322_Public_Management_as_a_University_Discipline_in_New_European_Union_Member_States","242576201_An_Education_Strategy_for_Practitioners_in_Public_Administration_Master's_Programs","46508139_Public_Administration_Education_in_Italy_a_Statistical_Analysis","345536338_Becoming_a_Student_of_Reform","326028547_Values_Competencies_and_Public_Sector_Training_The_Value_Base_of_Administrative_Modernization","314525431_Teaching_and_learning_reflection_in_MPA_programs_Towards_a_strategy","303716176_Academic_executive_programs_in_public_administration_and_management_Some_variety_across_Europe","288875976_Illiberal_or_simply_unorthodox_Public_Administration_education_in_Hungary_A_comparative_perspective","285863883_The_Waxing_and_Waning_of_the_State_and_its_Study_Changes_and_Challenges_in_the_Study_of_Public_Administration","273755527_Leadership_and_Culture_Comparative_Models_of_Top_Civil_Servant_Training","238344798_The_New_Institutionalism_Organization_Factors_in_Political_Life","233870062_Institutional_Theory_in_Political_Science_The''New_Institutionalism","230215065_Deregulation_and_the_decline_of_public_administration_teaching_in_the_UK","230208998_Public_Administration_Education_and_Europeanization_Prospects_for_the_Emancipation_of_a_Discipline","227467914_Public_Management_Reform_A_Comparative_Analysis","30529293_The_development_and_current_features_of_the_German_civil_service_system"]}
