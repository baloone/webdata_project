{"id":"274280539_Elliptic_integral_solutions_for_extensional_elastica_with_constant_initial_curvature","abstract":"It is well known that closed-form solutions for elastica problems can be expressed by elliptic integrals. However, the problems solved as far are mostly based on inextensional beam theory where the elongation of member axis is ignored. Herein, general solutions are derived for the extensional theories such as finite displacements with finite strains and those with small strains. In these derivations, special efforts are made to reduce the elliptic integrals to normal forms in order to obtain highly accurate solutions.","authors":["Goto Yoshiaki","Tokiharu Yamashita","Sei Matsuura"],"meta":["October 1987Doboku Gakkai Ronbunshu 386(386):83-93","DOI:10.2208/jscej.1987.386_83"],"references":[]}
