{"id":"345960359_Problem-based_learning_Effects_on_academic_performance_and_perceptions_of_engineering_students_in_computer_sciences","abstract":"In the present article we analyse the impact of problem-based learning (PBL) on learning and perceptions in first-year students undertaking Engineering in Computer Sciences. The module designed took a number of advanced theories of PBL and its application within the Engineering profession. Mixed methods were used to enable data from qualitative and quantitative instruments to be obtained. A quasi-experimental design was specified, employing non-probabilistic sampling, with a control (N = 40) and experimental group (N = 39). In comparing PBL with traditional methods, the results reveal statistically significant differences in aspects such as academic performance. Teamwork, oral communication, written communication and students’ perceptions of the learning experience were also all favoured. Nonetheless, lack of adequate team dynamics in previous learning experiences and reluctance to change traditional teaching approaches, could compromise the viability of that proposed.","authors":["Danilo Amaya Chávez","Vanesa María Gámiz-Sánchez","Antonio Cañas Vargas"],"meta":["September 2020Journal of Technology and Science Education 10(2):306","DOI:10.3926/jotse.969"],"references":["332614548_The_role_of_subject_presence_type_on_student_motivation_in_a_PBL_learning_environment","318017291_Aplicacion_de_un_aprendizaje_basado_en_problemas_en_studiantes_universitarios_de_ingenieria_del_riego","317295662_Engineering_Students_Enhancing_Employability_Skills_through_PBL","347784348_Management_of_Change_Implementation_of_Problem-Based_and_Project-Based_Learning_in_Engineering","336095885_Challenging_Models_and_Perspectives_of_Problem-Based_Learning","320859187_Gender_and_Participation_in_an_Engineering_Problem-Based_Learning_Environment","320117833_Problem_Based_Learning_for_engineering","319676697_PBL_in_Engineering_Education","316028987_An_assessment_of_resource_availability_for_problem_based_learning_in_a_Ghanaian_University_setting","309571206_Problem-based_Learning_into_the_Future_Imagining_an_Agile_PBL_Ecology_for_Learning"]}
