{"id":"327785582_Outfitting_Next_Generation_Displays_with_Optical_Metasurfaces","abstract":"Optical metasurfaces, composed of ultra-thin subwavelength meta-atoms, have enabled flat-optics and corresponding flat optical components such as ultra-thin lenses, color filters and absorbers. Among the plethora of applications currently attracting great interest, next generation display techniques could further benefit from metasurface technology. Thanks to relatively simple mechanisms of amplitude and phase modulation of light by the meta-atoms, many of the recent research achievements in metasurfaces are related to display applications. In this Perspective, we focus on metasurface holograms and colorations for projective and reflective display techniques. First, we briefly introduce the working mechanism of metasurface holograms and colorations, and review state-of-the-art techniques in each field from perspective of materials, functionalities, and fabrication methodologies towards real-life display applications. Finally, we conclude on the potential outcome and outlook on this technology and highlight the key challenges to be solved for next generation display.","authors":["Inki Kim","Gwanho Yoon","Jaehyuck Jang","Patrice Genevet"],"meta":["September 2018ACS Photonics 5(10)","DOI:10.1021/acsphotonics.8b00809"],"references":["327603831_Full-space_Cloud_of_Random_Points_with_a_Scrambling_Metasurface","327271083_Modelling_of_free-form_conformal_metasurfaces","325906184_Geometric_metasurface_enabling_polarization_independent_beam_splitting","325802582_Active_Color_Control_in_a_Metasurface_by_Polarization_Rotation","324595445_Amino-acid-_A_nd_peptide-directed_synthesis_of_chiral_plasmonic_gold_nanoparticles","323346809_Real-Time_Tunable_Colors_from_Microfluidic_Reconfigurable_All-Dielectric_Metasurfaces","325885235_Crypto-Display_in_Dual-Mode_Metasurfaces_by_Simultaneous_Control_of_Phase_and_Spectral_Responses","324593562_Integrated_Resonant_Unit_of_Metasurfaces_for_Broadband_Efficiency_and_Phase_Manipulation","324126949_Polarization_Encoded_Color_Image_Embedded_in_a_Dielectric_Metasurface","323125344_Dynamic_Plasmonic_Color_Generation_Based_on_Phase_Transition_of_Vanadium_Dioxide"]}
