However, the techniques for studying the perception of artworks in human brain have only been developed in the last fifty years. These technologies have made possible the observation of the processes in the brains of artists and viewers. This fast growing field has recently been named as Neuroaesthetics. One of the important discoveries in this field has been Mirror Neurons. They simulate the processes in the brain during the observation of the actions of others. Interestingly, by the help of Mirror Neurons, the observers of artworks comprehend the performances of the artists. The aim of this article is to discuss the recent developments in the field of Neuroaesthetics especially for the perception of artworks. The future trends will also be discussed from the perspectives of Mirror Neurons and Mental Imaging.","authors":["Talat Ciftci"],"meta":["January 2017The Journal of Social Sciences 14(14):1-14","DOI:10.16990/SOBIDER.3680"],"references":[]}
