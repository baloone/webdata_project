{"id":"344434872_Comparative_Case_Study_of_Plan-Driven_and_Agile_Approaches_in_Student_Computing_Projects","abstract":"Plan first, execute second\" and \"Adapt to change as you iterate\" are two paradigms that are well known in software development, as they represent disparate schools of project management: traditional and agile. Despite a long-lasting debate on prominence of each, little comparative research has been reported, particularly in the context of academic projects, where all too often a no-process approach still prevails. This paper presents an experiment that was carried out during the Spring semester of the 2018-2019 academic year at two engineering schools in Europe in order to assess the impacts of a given development method on the success of student computing undertakings. A structured, metric-based assessment scheme was applied to reveal patterns associated with the use of Plan-driven, Iterative and no-process approaches on product quality, team productivity and teamwork quality facets.","authors":["Rafal Wlodarski","Jean-Remy Falleri","Aneta Poniszewska-Maranda"],"meta":["September 2020","DOI:10.23919/SoftCOM50211.2020.9238196","Conference: 2020 International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks"],"references":["320012681_Measuring_dimensions_of_Software_Engineering_projects'_success_in_Academic_context","303296554_Learning_Agile_software_development_in_high_school_an_investigation","289495191_Measuring_the_Impact_of_Agile_Coaching_on_Students'_Performance","349861048_Learning_to_Teach_in_Higher_Education","326114603_Project_Management_Research-The_Challenge_and_Opportunity","325902722_TEAMSCOPE_measuring_software_engineering_processes_with_teamwork_telemetry","319148044_Software_Process_Diversity_Conceptualization_Measurement_and_Analysis_of_Impact_on_Project_Performance","315951888_Source_Code_Metrics_A_Systematic_Mapping_Study","287239862_Planning_and_sprinting_Use_of_a_hybrid_project_use_of_a_hybrid_project_use_of_a_hybrid_project_management_methodology_within_a_CIS_capstone_course","282398438_Agile_Methods_Tailoring_-_A_Systematic_Literature_Review"]}
