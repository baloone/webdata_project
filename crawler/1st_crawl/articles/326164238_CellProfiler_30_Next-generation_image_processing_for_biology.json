{"id":"326164238_CellProfiler_30_Next-generation_image_processing_for_biology","abstract":"Author summary\nThe “big-data revolution” has struck biology: it is now common for robots to prepare cell samples and take thousands of microscopy images. Looking at the resulting images by eye would be extremely tedious, not to mention subjective. Thus, many biologists find they need software to analyze images easily and accurately. The third major release of our free open-source software CellProfiler is designed to help biologists working with images, whether a few or thousands. Researchers can download an online example workflow (that is, a “pipeline”) or create their own from scratch. Pipelines are easy to save, reuse, and share, helping improve scientific reproducibility. In this release, we’ve added the capability to find and measure objects in three-dimensional (3D) images. We’ve also made changes to CellProfiler’s underlying code to make it faster to run and easier to install, and we’ve added the ability to process images in the cloud and using neural networks (deep learning). We’ve also added more explanations to CellProfiler’s settings to help new users get started. We hope these changes will make CellProfiler an even better tool for current users and will provide new users better ways to get started doing quantitative image analysis.","authors":["Claire McQuin","Allen Goodman","Vasiliy S Chernyshev","Lee Kamentsky"],"meta":["July 2018PLoS Biology 16(7):e2005970","DOI:10.1371/journal.pbio.2005970","Project: Cellprofiler"],"references":["324898416_Blastocyst-like_structures_generated_solely_from_stem_cells","324240469_Opportunities_and_obstacles_for_deep_learning_in_biology_and_medicine","323782068_Assessing_microscope_image_focus_quality_with_deep_learning","320722620_An_Objective_Comparison_of_Cell_Tracking_Algorithms","319414341_Data-analysis_strategies_for_image-based_cell_profiling","319042973_Automated_Training_of_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_Cell_Segmentation","332980634_Systematic_morphological_profiling_of_human_gene_and_allele_function_via_Cell_Painting","321105319_Image-based_ex-vivo_drug_screening_for_patients_with_aggressive_haematological_malignancies_interim_results_from_a_single-arm_open-label_pilot_study","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","319156217_Systematic_gene_tagging_using_CRISPRCas9_in_human_stem_cells_to_illuminate_cell_organization","318738093_KNIME_for_reproducible_cross-domain_analysis_of_life_science_data","317350688_Opportunities_And_Obstacles_For_Deep_Learning_In_Biology_And_Medicine","312620721_ImageJ2_ImageJ_for_the_next_generation_of_scientific_image_data","306931998_Cell_Painting_a_high-content_image-based_assay_for_morphological_profiling_using_multiplexed_fluorescent_dyes","308096357_MitoGen_A_Framework_for_Generating_3D_Synthetic_Time-Lapse_Sequences_of_Cell_Populations_in_Fluorescence_Microscopy"]}
