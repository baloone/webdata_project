{"id":"283535764_Improved_collision_operator_for_plasma_kinetic_simulations_with_multi-species_ions_and_electrons","abstract":"A linearized collision operator, which preserves the conservation properties of particles, momentum, and energy, and the self-adjointness relation (H-theorem) for arbitrary particle species, is applied to Eulerian kinetic simulations of multi-species ions and electrons. Velocity-space grid number scans clarify that numerical errors in like-particle and unlike-ion collisions are sufficiently small under turbulence-simulation relevant resolutions. For electron-ion/ion-electron collisions, it is identified that highly steep and localized nature in the velocity-space leads to relatively larger conservation errors in the standard implementation without error corrections. In order to resolve such numerical difficulties, a modified field-particle operator based on the original one is newly constructed, so that the conservation properties are improved to achieve the round-off error levels. It is confirmed that the modified collision operator successfully reproduces the collisional relaxation of multi-species ions and electrons towards their equilibrium distributions satisfying the H-theorem.","authors":["Motoki Nakata","Masanori Nunami","Tomo-Hiko Watanabe","Hideo Sugama"],"meta":["December 2015Computer Physics Communications 197:61-72","DOI:10.1016/j.cpc.2015.08.007"],"references":["243418103_TOPICAL_REVIEW_Gyrokinetic_simulations_of_turbulent_transport","234914575_Gyrokinetic_simulations_of_ion_and_impurity_transport","49459473_Neoclassical_equilibria_as_starting_point_for_global_gyrokinetic_microturbulence_simulations","40878008_Development_of_a_Non-Local_Neoclassical_Transport_Code_for_Helical_Configurations","40219516_Gyrokinetic_simulations_of_impurity_He_ash_and_a_particle_transport_and_consequences_on_ITER_transport_modelling","2210494_Gyrokinetic_turbulence_A_nonlinear_route_to_dissipation_through_phase_space","2206544_Linearized_model_Fokker-Planck_collision_operators_for_gyrokinetic_simulations_II_Numerical_implementation_and_tests","1746178_Linearized_model_Fokker-Planck_collision_operators_for_gyrokinetic_simulations_I_Theory","287939921_Local_Gyrokinetic_Vlasov_Simulations_with_Realistic_Tokamak_MHD_Equilibria","277324545_Development_of_Linearized_Collision_Operator_for_Multiple_Ion_Species_in_Gyrokinetic_Flux-Tube_Simulations","253743303_A_new_f_method_for_neoclassical_transport_studies","253044266_Plasma_Transport_in_Toroidal_Confinement_Systems","243698973_Plasma_Oscillations_with_Diffusion_in_Velocity_Space","234984529_Nonlinear_entropy_transfer_via_zonal_flows_in_gyrokinetic_plasma_turbulence","234939964_Drift-kinetic_simulation_of_neoclassical_transport_with_impurities_in_tokamaks","234841187_Theory_of_plasma_transport_in_toroidal_confinement_systems","231033972_Full_linearized_Fokker-Planck_collisions_in_neoclassical_transport_simulations","230950703_Neoclassical_transport_of_impurities_in_tokamak_plasmas","222488464_Lele_SK_Compact_Finite_Difference_Schemes_with_Spectral-like_Resolution_Journal_of_Computational_Physics_1031_16-42","220206222_Unlike-particle_collision_operator_for_gyrokinetic_particle_simulations","48930452_Velocity-Space_Structures_of_Distribution_Function_in_Toroidal_Ion_Temperature_Gradient_Turbulence","41114353_Kinetic_simulation_of_steady_states_of_ion_temperature_gradient_driven_turbulence_with_weak_collisionality"]}
