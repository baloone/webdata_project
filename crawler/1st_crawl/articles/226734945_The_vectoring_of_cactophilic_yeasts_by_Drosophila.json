{"id":"226734945_The_vectoring_of_cactophilic_yeasts_by_Drosophila","abstract":"At two locations in the Sonoran Desert, yeasts were sampled from species of Drosophila, the flies' cactus hosts, and other neighboring sources of cactophilic yeasts to determine the relation between the yeasts vectored by the fly and the yeasts found in their breeding sites. D. mojavensis, D. nigrospiracula, and D. mettleri vectored yeast assemblages significantly more similar to the yeast species found on the rot from which the flies were collected than to the yeasts found on other rots from the flies host cactus or other rotting cactus at the same site. Rots with Drosophila had fewer yeast species than those without flies, suggesting that flies were associated with younger rots. Rots with flies and the Drosophila also had more yeast species with the capability to produce ethyl acetate than rots without flies. The results support the contention that cactophilic Drosophila feed on a subset of the yeasts available in an area, and may act to maintain differences among the yeast communities found on different species of cactus.","authors":["Phil F Ganter"],"meta":["April 1988Oecologia 75(3):400-404","DOI:10.1007/BF00376943"],"references":["258522061_Analysis_of_the_community_structure_of_yeasts_associated_with_the_decaying_stems_of_Cactus_I_Stenocereus_gummosus","258502273_The_ecology_of_the_yeast_flora_in_necrotic_Opuntia_cacti_of_associated_Drosophila_in_Australia","248027896_Analysis_of_the_community_structure_of_yeasts_associated_with_the_decaying_stems_of_cactus_II_Opuntia_species","233991224_Yeasts_Vectored_by_Insects_Feeding_on_Decaying_Saguaro_Cactus","233980225_Pichia_deserticola_and_Candida_deserticola_Two_New_Species_of_Yeasts_Associated_with_Necrotic_Stems_of_Cacti","233980217_Analysis_of_the_community_structure_of_yeasts_associated_with_the_decaying_stems_of_cactus_III_Stenocereus_thurberi","233980170_Yeasts_associated_with_plants_insects_and_soil","226892647_Yeast_communities_from_host_plants_and_associated_Drosophila_in_southern_arizona_new_isolations_and_analysis_of_the_relative_importance_of_hosts_and_vectors_on_comunity_composition","226627673_Coadaptation_of_Drosophila_and_yeasts_in_their_natural_habitat","225310151_Comparisons_of_yeast_florae_from_natural_substrates_and_larval_guts_of_southwestern_Drosophila","317314731_A_COMPARISON_OF_DROSOPHILA_HABITATS_ACCORDING_TO_THE_PHYSIOLOGICAL_ATTRIBUTES_OF_THE_ASSOCIATED_YEAST_COMMUNITIES","290041914_Ecology_and_Genetics_of_Sonoran_Desert_Drosophila","289010766_Methods_for_the_isolation_maintenance_classification_and_identification_of_yeasts","274198916_Ecological_Genetics_and_Evolution_The_Cactus-Yeast-Drosophila_Model_System","272561247_The_Ever-Changing_Landscape_of_Cactus_Systematics","269421407_The_Yeast_Flora_of_The_Natural_Breeding_Sites_of_Some_Species_of_Drosophila","268687536_Practical_Nonparametric_Statistics","235631752_A_Comparison_of_Drosophila_Habitats_According_to_the_Physiological_Attributes_of_the_Associated_Yeast_Communities","225847615_Dispersal_of_yeasts_and_bacteria_by_Drosophila_in_a_temperate_zone"]}
