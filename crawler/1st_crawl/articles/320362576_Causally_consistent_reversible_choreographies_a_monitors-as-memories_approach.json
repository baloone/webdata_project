{"id":"320362576_Causally_consistent_reversible_choreographies_a_monitors-as-memories_approach","abstract":"Under a reversible semantics, computation steps can be undone. This paper addresses the integration of reversible semantics into a process model of multiparty protocols (choreographies). Building upon the monitors-as-memories approach that we developed in prior work for reversible binary protocols, we present a reversible process framework for multiparty communication, which improves on prior models by seamlessly integrating asynchrony, decoupled rollbacks, and process passing. As main technical result, we prove that our multiparty, reversible semantics is causally-consistent.","authors":["Claudio Antares Mezzina","Jorge A.
