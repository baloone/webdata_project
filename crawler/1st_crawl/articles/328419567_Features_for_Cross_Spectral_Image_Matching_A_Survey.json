{"id":"328419567_Features_for_Cross_Spectral_Image_Matching_A_Survey","abstract":"In recent years, cross spectral matching has been gaining attention in various biometric systems for identification and verification purposes. Cross spectral matching allows images taken under different electromagnetic spectrums to match each other. In cross spectral matching, one of the keys for successful matching is determined by the features used for representing an image. Therefore, the feature extraction step becomes an essential task. Researchers have improved matching accuracy by developing robust features. This paper presents most commonly selected features used in cross spectral matching. This survey covers basic concepts of cross spectral matching, visual and thermal features extraction, and state of the art descriptors. In the end, this paper provides a description of better feature selection methods in cross spectral matching.","authors":["Maulisa Oktiana","Khairul Munadi","Fitri Arnia","Yuwaldi Away"],"meta":["October 2018Bulletin of Electrical Engineering and Informatics 7(4)","DOI:10.11591/eei.v7i4.843","Project: crossspectral image"],"references":["325700365_Development_of_Efficient_Iris_Identification_Algorithm_using_Wavelet_Packets_for_Smartphone_Application","320248789_A_New_Approach_of_Iris_Detection_and_Recognition","313553666_Statistical_Feature_extraction_to_classify_oral_cancers","313182074_An_efficient_approach_for_robust_multimodal_retinal_image_registration_based_on_ur-sift_features_and_piifd_descriptors","308889076_Cross-spectral_Iris_Recognition_for_Mobile_Applications_using_High-quality_Color_Images","308851424_NIR-VIS_heterogeneous_face_recognition_via_cross-spectral_joint_dictionary_learning_and_reconstruction","283091506_Recognition_Performance_of_Cross-Spectral_Periocular_Biometrics_and_Partial_Face_at_Short_and_Long_Standoff_Distance","279954511_Deep_Perceptual_Mapping_for_Thermal_to_Visible_Face_Recogntion","275721067_Face_Recognition_Using_Block_Based_Feature_Extraction_with_CZT_and_Goertzel-algorithm_as_a_Preprocessing_Technique","272196176_Thermal-to-visible_face_recognition_using_partial_least_squares","265741844_Enhancement_of_Iris_Recognition_System_Based_on_Phase_Only_Correlation","260003874_Infrared_face_recognition_A_comprehensive_review_of_methodologies_and_databases","258395285_Visible_and_Infrared_Face_Identification_via_Sparse_Representation","242275100_The_Discrete_Cosine_Transform_DCT_Theory_and_Application1","234138946_Long_Range_Cross-Spectral_Face_Recognition_Matching_SWIR_Against_Visible_Light_Images","221364435_Learning_mappings_for_face_synthesis_from_near_infrared_to_visual_light_images","220932119_Cross-Spectral_Face_Verification_in_the_Short_Wave_Infrared_SWIR_Band","220928354_Heterogeneous_Face_Recognition_Matching_NIR_to_Visible_Light_Images","45825473_Face_Recognition_Using_Particle_Swarm_Optimization-Based_Selected_Features","345728722_On_Matching_Visible_to_Passive_Infrared_Face_Images_Using_Image_Synthesis_Denoising","334108727_Feature_Selection_and_Extraction_for_Content-Based_Image_Retrieval","319770820_Histograms_of_Oriented_Gradients_for_Human_Detection","309814720_A_novel_framework_for_cross-spectral_iris_matching","309082436_Toward_More_Accurate_Iris_Recognition_Using_Cross-Spectral_Matching","301915616_Human_Face_Recognition_using_Random_Forest_based_Fusion_ofA-trous_Wavelet_Transform_Coefficients_from_Thermal_and_Visible_Images","299822199_Using_pyramid_of_histogram_of_oriented_gradients_on_natural_scene_text_recognition","284088228_Enhanced_local_texture_feature_sets_for_face_recognition_under_difficult_lighting_conditions","282632829_Matching_Thermal_to_Visible_Face_Images_Using_Hidden_Factor_Analysis_in_a_Cascaded_Subspace_Learning_Framework","281414712_Structural_and_Statistical_Feature_Extraction_Methods_for_Character_and_Digit_Recognition","275405848_Ordinal_Measure_of_Discrete_Cosine_Transform_Coefficients_and_its_Application_to_Fingerprint_Matching","268813920_Feature_Extraction_for_Content_Based_Image_Retrieval","262971632_Nighttime_Face_Recognition_at_Large_Standoff_Cross-Distance_and_Cross-Spectral_Matching","262404816_Nighttime_Face_Recognition_at_Long_Distance_Cross-Distance_and_Cross-Spectral_Matching","261165805_BSIF_Binarized_statistical_image_features","260523586_Matching_NIR_face_to_VIS_face_using_transduction","225019141_Face_recognition_using_spectrum-based_feature_extraction","223821842_Feature_extraction_using_discrete_cosine_transform_and_discrimination_power_analysis_with_a_face_recognition_technology","222738212_A_Comparative_Study_of_Texture_Measures_with_Classification_Based_on_Feature_Distributions","220776382_Face_Recognition_from_Visible_and_Near-Infrared_Images_Using_Boosted_Directional_Binary_Code","220645654_Rotation_illumination_invariant_polynomial_kernel_Fisher_discriminant_analysis_using_Radon_and_discrete_cosine_transforms_based_features_for_face_recognition","3193420_Multiresolution_Gray-Scale_and_Rotation_Invariant_Texture_Classification_with_Local_Binary_Patterns","3046065_Discrete_Cosine_Transform"]}
