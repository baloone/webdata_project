{"id":"51181122_Two-dimensional_continuous_wavelet_transform_for_phase_determination_of_complex_interferograms","abstract":"A robust two-dimensional continuous wavelet transform (2D-CWT) technique for interferogram analysis is presented. To cope with the phase determination ambiguity issue encountered in the analysis of complex interferograms, a phase determination rule is proposed according to the phase distribution continuity, and a frequency-guided scheme is employed to obtain the correct phase distribution following a conventional 2D-CWT analysis. The theories are given in details, and the validity of the proposed technique is verified by computer simulation and real experiments.","authors":["Jun Ma","Zhaoyang Wang","Bing Pan","Thang Hoang"],"meta":["June 2011Applied Optics 50(16):2425-30","DOI:10.1364/AO.50.002425","SourcePubMed"],"references":["271702103_Digital_Processing_of_Interferograms","247164736_Fringe-follower_regularized_phase_tracker_for_demodulation_of_closed-fringe_interferograms","268999170_Two-Dimensional_Wavelets_and_Their_Relatives","255610788_Advanced_continuous_wavelet_transform_algorithm_for_digital_interferogram_analysis_and_processing","241227379_Spatial_Carrier_Fringe_Pattern_Demodulation_by_Use_of_a_Two-Dimensional_Continuous_Paul_Wavelet_Transform","227303228_Strain_Analysis_for_Moir_Interferometry_Using_the_Two-Dimensional_Continuous_Wavelet_Transform","223363629_Phase_retrieval_of_speckle_fringe_pattern_with_carriers_using_2D_wavelet_transform","222417500_Two-dimensional_windowed_Fourier_transform_for_fringe_pattern_analysis_Principles_applications_and_implementations","221725173_Fourier-transform_method_of_fringe-pattern_analysis_for_computer-based_topography_and_inteferometry","47809461_Fast_frequency-guided_sequential_demodulation_of_a_single_fringe_pattern","8695055_Moir_Interferogram_Phase_Extraction_A_Ridge_Detection_Algorithm_for_Continuous_Wavelet_Transforms","7372146_Regularized_quadrature_and_phase_tracking_from_a_single_close-fringe_interferogram","44636232_Wavelet_ridge_techniques_in_optical_fringe_pattern_analysis","40900187_Frequency-guided_windowed_Fourier_ridges_technique_for_automatic_demodulation_of_a_single_closed_fringe_pattern","26749021_Frequency_guided_methods_for_demodulation_of_a_single_fringe_pattern"]}
