{"id":"265337635_Generation_and_Analysis_of_Constrained_Random_Sampling_Patterns","abstract":"Random sampling is a technique for signal acquisition which is gaining\npopularity in practical signal processing systems. Nowadays, event-driven\nanalog-to-digital converters make random sampling feasible in practical\napplications. A process of random sampling is defined by a sampling pattern,\nwhich indicates signal sampling points in time. Practical random sampling\npatterns are constrained by ADC characteristics and application requirements.\nIn this paper authors introduce statistical methods which evaluate random\nsampling pattern generators with emphasis on practical applications.\nFurthermore, the authors propose a new random pattern generator which copes\nwith strict practical limitations imposed on patterns, with possibly minimal\nloss in randomness of sampling. The proposed generator is compared with\nexisting sampling pattern generators using the introduced statistical methods.\nIt is shown that the proposed algorithm generates random sampling patterns\ndedicated for event-driven-ADCs better than existed sampling pattern\ngenerators. Finally, implementation issues of random sampling patterns are\ndiscussed.","authors":["Jacek Pierzchlewski","Thomas Arildsen"],"meta":["October 2016Circuits Systems and Signal Processing 35(10)","DOI:10.1007/s00034-015-0216-0","SourcearXiv"],"references":["262248699_Nonuniform_Sampling_Theory_and_Practice","260618944_A_Non-Uniform_Sampler_for_Wideband_Spectrally-Sparse_Environments","225693010_Efficient_numerical_methods_in_non-uniform_sampling_theory","224402100_Reproducible_Research_in_Signal_Processing","224060222_Random_Sampling_for_Analog-to-Information_Conversion_of_Wideband_Signals","277287050_Randomised_Sampling_for_Radio_Design","267060101_Randomized_Signal_Processing","242362041_Alias-Free_Sampling_of_Random_Noise","224564396_Real-time_acquisition_of_wideband_signals_data_using_non-uniform_sampling","224513791_A_Simple_Proof_of_the_Restricted_Isometry_Property_for_Random_Matrices","30767984_An_Introduction_To_Compressive_Sampling_A_sensingsampling_paradigm_that_goes_against_the_common_knowledge_in_data_acquisition","4340026_Pseudorandom_Clock_Signal_Generation_for_Data_Conversion_in_a_Multistandard_Receiver","4019094_Nonuniform_sampling_driver_design_for_optimal_ADC_utilization","3554462_Spectral_analysis_of_irregular_samples_of_multidimensional_signals","3325080_Periodically_nonuniform_sampling_of_bandpass_signals"]}
