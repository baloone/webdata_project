{"id":"350332229_An_interdisciplinary_approach_on_efficient_virtual_microgrid_to_virtual_microgrid_energy_balancing_incorporating_data_preprocessing_techniques","abstract":"A way to improve energy management is to perform balancing both at the Peer-to-peer (P2P) level and then at the Virtual Microgrid-to-Virtual Microgrid (VMG2VMG) level, while considering the intermittency of available Renewable Energy Source (RES). This paper proposes an interdisciplinary analytics-based approach for the formation of VMGs addressing energy balancing. Our approach incorporates Computer Science methods to address an Energy sector problem, utilizing data preprocessing techniques and Machine Learning concepts. It features P2P balancing, where each peer is a prosumer perceived as an individual entity, and Virtual Microgrids (VMGs) as clusters of peers. We conducted several simulations utilizing clustering and binning algorithms for preprocessing energy data. Our approach offers options for generating VMGs of prosumers, prior to using a customized Exhaustive brute-force Balancing Algorithm (EBA). EBA performs balancing at the cluster-to-cluster level, perceived as VMG2VMG balancing. To that end, the study simulates on data from 94 prosumers, and reports outcomes, biases, and prospects for scaling up and expanding this work. Finally, this paper outlines potential ideal usages for the approach, either standalone or integrated with other toolkits and technologies.","authors":["Paraskevas Koukaras","Christos Tjortjis","Paschalis Gkaidatzis","Napoleon Bezas"],"meta":["March 2021Computing","DOI:10.1007/s00607-021-00929-7","Project: Smart cities"],"references":["339339774_Energy_Flexibility_Prediction_for_Data_Center_Engagement_in_Demand_Response_Programs","338250433_A_Decision_Support_System_Tool_to_Manage_the_Flexibility_in_Renewable_Energy-Based_Power_Systems","337487813_Phase_Balancing_and_Reactive_Power_Support_Services_for_Microgrids","337360335_Recent_Approaches_of_Forecasting_and_Optimal_Economic_Dispatch_to_Overcome_Intermittency_of_Wind_and_Photovoltaic_PV_Systems_A_Review","335156534_Energy_Peer-to-Peer_Trading_in_Virtual_Microgrids_in_Smart_Grids_A_Game-Theoretic_Approach","345431522_Microgrid_Architectures_Control_and_Protection_Methods","342395749_Optimal_operation_strategy_for_interconnected_microgrids_in_market_environment_considering_uncertainty","340177686_Data_Structures_for_Statistical_Computing_in_Python","338313285_Microgrids_Overview_and_guidelines_for_practical_implementations_and_operation","334887801_A_real-life_experience_on_2_nd_life_batteries_services_for_Distribution_System_Operator","334668069_DRIMPAC-Unified_Demand_Response_Interoperability_Framework_Enabling_Market_Participation_of_Active_Energy_Consumers","334383654_Blockchain-Based_Scalable_and_Tamper-Evident_Solution_for_Registering_Energy_Data","330246174_Decentralized_blockchain_flexibility_system_for_Smart_Grids_Requirements_engineering_and_use_cases","334566369_A_multipurpose_ICT_platform_for_supporting_energy_transition_first_results_in_flexibility_profiling","334275554_Social_Media_Analytics_Types_and_Methodology"]}
