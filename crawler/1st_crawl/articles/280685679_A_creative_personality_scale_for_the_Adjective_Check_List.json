{"id":"280685679_A_creative_personality_scale_for_the_Adjective_Check_List","abstract":"The Adjective Check List was administered to 7 male and 5 female samples comprising 1,701 Ss. Direct or inferred ratings of creativity were available for all Ss. The samples covered a wide range of ages and kinds of work; criteria of creativity were also varied, including ratings by expert judges, faculty members, personality assessment staff observers, and life history interviewers. The creativity scales of G. Domino (1974) and C. E. Schaefer (1972, 1973) were scored on all protocols, as were G. S. Welsh's (1975) A-1, A-2, A-3, and A-4 scales for different combinations of \"origence\" and \"intelligence.\" From item analyses a new 30-item Creative Personality Scale was developed that was positively and significantly related to all 6 of the prior measures but that surpassed them in its correlations with the criterion evaluations.
