{"id":"281497171_Random_variate_generation_for_Laguerre-type_exponentially_tilted_a-stable_distributions","abstract":"Exact sampling methods have been recently developed for generating random variates for exponentially tilted α-stable distributions. In this paper we show how to generate, exactly, random variates for a more general class of tilted α-stable distributions, which is referred to as the class of Laguerre-type exponentially tilted α-stable distributions. Beside the exponentially tilted α-stable distribution, such a class includes also the Erlang tilted α-stable distribution. This is a special case of the so-called gamma tilted α-stable distribution, for which an efficient exact random variate generator is currently not available in the literature. Our result fills this gap. © 2015, Institute of Mathematical Statistics.
