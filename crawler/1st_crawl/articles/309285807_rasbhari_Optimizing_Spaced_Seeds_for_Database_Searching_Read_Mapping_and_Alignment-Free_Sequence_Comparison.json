{"id":"309285807_rasbhari_Optimizing_Spaced_Seeds_for_Database_Searching_Read_Mapping_and_Alignment-Free_Sequence_Comparison","abstract":"Many algorithms for sequence analysis use patterns or spaced seeds consisting\nof match and don't-care positions, such that only characters at the match\npositions are considered when sub-words of the sequences are counted or\ncompared. The performance of these approaches depends on the underlying\npatterns. Herein, we show that the overlap complexity of a pattern set that was\nintroduced by Ilie and Ilie is closely related to the variance of the number of\nspaced-word matches between two evolutionarily related sequences, with respect\nto this pattern set. We propose an improved hill-climbing algorithm to optimize\nsets of patterns or multiple seeds for database searching, read mapping and\nalignment-free sequence comparison. Experimental results show that our approach\ngenerates seeds with higher sensitivity than existing approaches. In our\nspaced-words approach to alignment-free sequence comparison, pattern sets\ncalculated with RasBhari led to more accurate estimates of phylogenetic\ndistances than the randomly generated pattern sets that we previously used.
