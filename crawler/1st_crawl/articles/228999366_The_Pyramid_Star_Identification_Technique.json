{"id":"228999366_The_Pyramid_Star_Identification_Technique","abstract":"A new highly robust algorithm, called Pyramid, is presented to identify the stars observed by star trackers in the general lost in space case, where no a priori estimate of pointing is available. At the heart of the method is the k-vector approach for accessing the star catalog, which provides a search-less mean to obtain all possible cataloged stars from the whole sky that could possibly correspond to a particular measured pair, given the measured interstar angle and the measurement precision. The Pyramid logic is built on the identification of a four star polygon structure -the Pyramid -which is associated with an almost certain star identification. Consequently, the Pyramid algorithm is capable to identify and discard even a high number of spikes (false stars). The method, which has already been tested in space, is demonstrated to be highly efficient, extremely robust and fast. All of these developments are supported by simulations and by a few ground test experimental results.","authors":["D.
