{"id":"299375650_Different_Medical_Data_Mining_Approaches_Based_Prediction_of_Ischemic_Stroke","abstract":"Aim: \nMedical data mining (also called knowledge discovery process in medicine) processes for extracting patterns from large datasets. In the current study, we intend to assess different medical data mining approaches to predict ischemic stroke.\n\nMaterials and methods: \nThe collected dataset from Turgut Ozal Medical Centre, Inonu University, Malatya, Turkey, comprised the medical records of 80 patients and 112 healthy individuals with 17 predictors and a target variable. As data mining approaches, support vector machine (SVM), stochastic gradient boosting (SGB) and penalized logistic regression (PLR) were employed. 10-fold cross validation resampling method was utilized, and model performance evaluation metrics were accuracy, area under ROC curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value. The grid search method was used for optimizing tuning parameters of the models.\n\nResults: \nThe accuracy values with 95% CI were 0.9789 (0.9470-0.9942) for SVM, 0.9737 (0.9397-0.9914) for SGB and 0.8947 (0.8421-0.9345) for PLR. The AUC values with 95% CI were 0.9783 (0.9569-0.9997) for SVM, 0.9757 (0.9543-0.9970) for SGB and 0.8953 (0.8510-0.9396) for PLR.\n\nConclusions: \nThe results of the current study demonstrated that the SVM produced the best predictive performance compared to the other models according to the majority of evaluation metrics. SVM and SGB models explained in the current study could yield remarkable predictive performance in the classification of ischemic stroke.","authors":["Ahmet Kadir ARSLAN","Cemil Colak","Ediz Sarihan"],"meta":["March 2016Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine 130","DOI:10.1016/j.cmpb.2016.03.022"],"references":["287213627_Classifiers_for_Ischemic_Stroke_Lesion_Segmentation_A_Comparison_Study","284790887_Using_Blood_Indexes_to_Predict_Overweight_Statuses_An_Extreme_Learning_Machine-Based_Approach","282019589_Voxel-based_Gaussian_naive_Bayes_classification_of_ischemic_stroke_lesions_in_individual_T1-weighted_MRI_scans","277917641_Application_of_K-Means_and_Genetic_Algorithms_for_Dimension_Reduction_by_Integrating_SVM_for_Diabetes_Diagnosis","236870185_Modelling_species_distributions_with_penalised_logistic_regressions_A_comparison_with_maximum_entropy_models","230856452_Nearest-Neighbor_and_Clustering_based_Anomaly_Detection_Algorithms_for_RapidMiner","230835614_Improving_diagnostic_accuracy_using_agent-based_distributed_data_mining_system","222573328_Stochastic_Gradient_Boosting","221654326_An_integrated_machine_learning_approach_to_stroke_prediction","26568624_Building_Predictive_Models_in_R_Using_the_caret_Package","6399582_Penalized_Logistic_Regression_for_Detecting_Gene_Interactions","2819899_Medical_Diagnosis_Of_Stroke_Using_Inductive_Machine_Learning","303122038_Random_forests_with_selected_features_for_stroke_lesion_segmentation","273790052_Application_of_Knowledge_Discovery_Process_on_the_Prediction_of_Stroke","45439998_Evolutionary-driven_support_vector_machines_for_determining_the_degree_of_liver_fibrosis_in_chronic_hepatitis_C","21288750_Atrial_fibrillation_as_an_independent_risk_factor_for_stroke_The_Framingham_Study","20851481_Risk_factors_for_stroke_in_middle-aged_men_in_Goteborg_Sweden","15521348_Adams_HP_Jr_Bendixen_BH_Kappelle_LJ_Biller_J_Love_BB_Gordon_DL_Marsh_EE_TOAST_InvestigatorsClassification_of_subtype_of_acute_ischemic_stroke_definitions_for_use_in_a_multicenter_clinical_trial_Stroke","6774565_Two_Models_for_Outcome_Prediction_A_Comparison_of_Logistic_Regression_and_Neural_Networks","6318077_Guidelines_for_the_Early_Management_of_Adults_With_Ischemic_Stroke_A_Guideline_From_the_American_Heart_Association_American_Stroke_Association_Stroke_Council_Clinical_Cardiology_Council_Cardiovascular","2407569_The_Boosting_Approach_to_Machine_Learning_An_Overview"]}
