{"id":"301875981_Chudnovsky's_Conjecture_for_very_general_points_in_mathbbP_kN","abstract":"We prove a long-standing conjecture of Chudnovsky for very general and generic points in $\\mathbb{P}_k^N$, where $k$ is an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, and for any finite set of points lying on a quadric, without any assumptions on $k$. We also prove that for any homogeneous ideal $I$ in the homogeneous coordinate ring $R=k[x_0, \\ldots, x_N]$, Chudnovsky's conjecture holds for large enough symbolic powers of $I$.","authors":["Louiza Fouli","Paolo Mantero","Yu Xie"],"meta":["April 2016Journal of Algebra 498","DOI:10.1016/j.jalgebra.2017.11.002"],"references":["243088095_The_Hilbert_Function_of_a_Reduced_K-Algebra","266512605_Singular_points_on_complex_hypersurfaces_and_multidimensional_Schwarz_lemma","253304145_Symbolic_powers_of_ideals_of_generic_points_in_P3","242975429_Sur_une_minoration_du_degr_d'hypersurfaces_s'annulant_en_certains_points","240150390_On_the_14-th_problem_of_Hilbert","239786498_On_the_14-th_Problem_of_Hilbert","237131519_Discriminants_Resultants_and_Multidimensional_Determinants","228449628_Star_configurations_in_Pn","225684544_Estimations_L2_pour_l'operateur_et_applications_arithmetiques","225220604_Proprietes_arithmetiques_de_fonctions_de_plusieurs_variables_II"]}
