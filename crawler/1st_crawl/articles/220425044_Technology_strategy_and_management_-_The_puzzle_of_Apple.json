{"id":"220425044_Technology_strategy_and_management_-_The_puzzle_of_Apple","abstract":"Apple, Inc., one of the greatest product development companies, is looking forward to pursue product and platform leadership simultaneously to meet the increasing demands of its customers. Initially Apple did not opt for a platform strategy in case of its hardware-software system Macintosh, which would have meant licensing the Macintosh operating system widely and working openly with other companies and producers to evolve the platform and create applications for the mass market. Eventually, under pressure, Apple opened up its iPod software to play some other music formats along with those from the Macintosh and iTunes music warehouse. Based on Sony's experience with VCRs, or Microsoft's with MS-DOS and Windows, it is evident that platform companies must work with industry players and be willing to make technical and design compromises. Customers have thereby eventually pressured Apple to open its products, enabling it to pursue product and platform leadership simultaneously.","authors":["Michael A.
