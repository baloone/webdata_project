{"id":"262256710_Here's_my_cert_so_trust_me_maybe_Understanding_TLS_errors_on_the_web","abstract":"When browsers report TLS errors, they cannot distinguish between attacks and harmless server misconfigurations; hence they leave it to the user to decide whether continuing is safe. However, actual attacks remain rare. As a result, users quickly become used to \"false positives\" that deplete their attention span, making it unlikely that they will pay sufficient scrutiny when a real attack comes along. Consequently, browser vendors should aim to minimize the number of low-risk warnings they report. To guide that process, we perform a large-scale measurement study of common TLS warnings. Using a set of passive network monitors located at different sites, we identify the prevalence of warnings for a total population of about 300,000 users over a nine-month period. We identify low-risk scenarios that consume a large chunk of the user attention budget and make concrete recommendations to browser vendors that will help maintain user attention in high-risk situations. We study the impact on end users with a data set much larger in scale than the data sets used in previous TLS measurement studies. A key novelty of our approach involves the use of internal browser code instead of generic TLS libraries for analysis, providing more accurate and representative results.","authors":["Devdatta Akhawe","Bernhard Amann","Matthias Vallentin","Robin Sommer"],"meta":["May 2013","DOI:10.1145/2488388.2488395","Conference: Proceedings of the 22nd international conference on World Wide Web"],"references":["266352987_Ron_was_wrong_Whit_is_right","254002916_The_SSL_landscape_a_thorough_analysis_of_the_X509_PKI_using_active_and_passive_measurements","241770660_Android_permissions_User_attention_comprehension_and_behavior","233754060_Why_Eve_and_Mallory_love_Android_An_analysis_of_Android_SSL_insecurity","221514650_You've_Been_Warned_An_Empirical_Study_of_the_Effectiveness_of_Web_Browser_Phishing_Warnings","262270941_Dynamic_application-layer_protocol_analysis_for_network_intrusion_detection","262173624_The_most_dangerous_code_in_the_world_validating_SSL_certificates_in_non-browser_software","250954734_Perspectives_Improving_SSH-style_Host_Authentication_with_MultiPath_Probing","245099749_A_system_for_detecting_network_intruders_in_real_time","241622915_On_the_challenges_in_usable_security_lab_studies_Lessons_learned_from_replicating_a_study_on_SSL_warnings","238041964_The_security_cost_of_cheap_user_interaction","227806160_Response_Strategies_for_Coping_With_the_Cognitive_Demands_of_Attitude_Measures_in_Surveys","222497719_Bro_A_system_for_detecting_network_intruders_in_real-time_Computer_Networks_3123-24","221655515_Conditioned-safe_Ceremonies_and_a_User_Study_of_an_Application_to_Web_Authentication","221516432_Why_phishing_works","221474636_Gathering_evidence_use_of_visual_security_cues_in_web_browsers","221260430_Crying_Wolf_An_Empirical_Study_of_SSL_Warning_Effectiveness","221166438_Do_Windows_users_follow_the_principle_of_least_privilege_Investigating_user_account_control_practices","220797043_Certified_Lies_Detecting_and_Defeating_Government_Interception_Attacks_Against_SSL","220476851_Internet_Security_Under_Attack_The_Undermining_of_Digital_Certificates"]}
