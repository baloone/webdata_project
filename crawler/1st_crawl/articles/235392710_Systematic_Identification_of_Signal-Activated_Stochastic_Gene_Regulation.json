{"id":"235392710_Systematic_Identification_of_Signal-Activated_Stochastic_Gene_Regulation","abstract":"Although much has been done to elucidate the biochemistry of signal transduction and gene regulatory pathways, it remains\ndifficult to understand or predict quantitative responses. We integrate single-cell experiments with stochastic analyses,\nto identify predictive models of transcriptional dynamics for the osmotic stress response pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We generate models with varying complexity and use parameter estimation and cross-validation analyses to select the most\npredictive model. This model yields insight into several dynamical features, including multistep regulation and switchlike\nactivation for several osmosensitive genes. Furthermore, the model correctly predicts the transcriptional dynamics of cells\nin response to different environmental and genetic perturbations. Because our approach is general, it should facilitate a\npredictive understanding for signal-activated transcription of other genes in other pathways or organisms.","authors":["Gregor Neuert","Brian Munsky","Rui Zhen Tan","Leonid Teytelman"],"meta":["February 2013Science 339(6119):584-587","DOI:10.1126/science.1231456","SourcePubMed"],"references":["230755696_Dynamics_of_protein_noise_can_distinguish_between_alternate_sources_of_gene-expression_variability","224919042_Moment-based_inference_predicts_bimodality_in_transient_gene_expression","224006419_Using_Gene_Expression_Noise_to_Understand_Gene_Regulation","221766161_Single-Cell_Analysis_Reveals_that_Noncoding_RNAs_Contribute_to_Clonal_Heterogeneity_by_Modulating_Transcription_Factor_Recruitment","51106449_Transient_Activation_of_the_HOG_MAPK_Pathway_Regulates_Bimodal_Gene_Expression","49967444_Structural_basis_of_RNA_polymerase_II_backtracking_arrest_and_reactivation","43346069_Inducible_gene_expression_Diverse_regulatory_mechanisms","38066010_Listening_to_the_Noise_Random_Fluctuations_Reveal_Gene_Network_Parameters","314420314_The_Finite_State_Projection_Approach_for_the_Analysis_of_Stochastic_Noise_in_Gene_Networks","45095726_A_Decade_of_Systems_Biology"]}
