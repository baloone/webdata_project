{"id":"290166913_Neuro-Fuzzy_Systems","abstract":"This paper is about so-called neuro-fuzzy systems, which combine methods from neural network theory with fuzzy systems. Such combinations have been considered for several years already. However, the term neuro-fuzzy still lacks proper definition, and still has the flavour of a buzzword to it. In this paper we try to give it a meaning in the context of three applications of fuzzy systems, which are fuzzy control, fuzzy classification, and fuzzy function approximation.\nSurprisingly few neuro-fuzzy approaches do actually employ neural networks, even though they are very often depicted in form of some kind of neural network structure. However, all approaches display some kind of learning capability, as it is known from neural networks. This means, they use algorithms which enable them to determine their parameters from training data in an iterative process. From our point of view neuro-fuzzy means using heuristic learning strategies derived from the domain of neural network theory to support the development of a fuzzy system.","authors":["Rudolf Kruse","Detlef Nauck"],"meta":["January 1998","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-58930-0_12","In book: Computational Intelligence: Soft Computing and Fuzzy-Neuro Integration with Applications (pp.230-259)"],"references":["224660547_Fuzzy_Kohonen_clustering_networks","221449328_A_Reinforcement_Learning_Algorithm_based_on_Safety","221000724_NEFCLASS_-_a_neuro-fuzzy_approach_for_the_classification_of_data","5576556_Fuzzy_min-max_neural_networks--I_Classification","3595351_NEFCON-I_an_X-Window_based_simulator_for_neural_fuzzy_controllers","3335606_Fuzzy_Control_on_the_Basis_of_Equality_Relations_-_with_an_Example_from_Idle_Speed_Control","3301660_Fuzzy_ARTMAP_A_Neural_Network_Architecture_for_Incremental_Supervised_Learning_of_Analog_Multidimensional_Maps","3113825_ANFIS_Adaptive-Network-based_Fuzzy_Inference_System","2526896_A_Theory_of_Networks_for_Approximation_and_Learning","313214493_Neuro-Fuzzy_Systems_Research_and_Applications_outside_of_Japan","306150595_Neural_Networks_A_Comprehensive_Foundation","268666661_Designing_Neuro-Fuzzy_Systems_through_Backpropagation","260869480_The_Use_of_Multiple_Measurements_in_Taxonomic_Problems","255937710_A_Reinforcement_Learning-Based_Architecture_for_Fuzzy_Logic_Control","246899051_Multilayer_feedforward_networks_are_universal_approximator","246528594_Introduction_to_Neural_Artificial_Systems","242395056_Neural_Networks_and_Fuzzy_Systems_A_Dynamical_System_Approach_Machine_Intelligence","239656782_Neuron-Like_Adaptive_Elements_That_Can_Solve_Difficult_Control_Problems","234805891_Foundation_of_Neuro-Fuzzy_Systems","224982370_Neural_Networks_-_A_Comprehensive_Foundation","223660704_Fuzzy_Kohonen_clustering_networks","223152751_An_introductory_survey_of_fuzzy_control","223062468_Backpropagation_neural_networks_for_fuzzy_logic","222797300_Multilayer_Feedforward_Networks_are_Universal_Approxmations_Neural_Networks_2_No_5_359-366","222634591_Sugeno_type_controllers_are_universal_controllers","222472292_Neural_Networks_in_Designing_Fuzzy_Systems_for_Real_World_Applications_Fuzz_y","222311443_Fuzzy_neural_networks_A_survey","222255593_Improving_classification_performance_using_fuzzy_MLP_and_two-level_selective_partitioning_of_feature_space","222193242_An_Experiment_in_Linguistic_Synthesis_with_a_Fuzzy_Logic_Controller","221998235_Neural_nets_for_fuzzy_systems","221956651_Fuzzy_self-organizing_map","220999785_Generation_and_improvement_of_fuzzy_classifiers_with_incremental_learning_using_fuzzy_RuleNet","220693196_Foundations_of_Fuzzy_System","216300608_The_Use_of_Multiple_Measurements_in_Taxonomic_Problems","208914898_An_Introduction_to_Neural_Computing","44538904_Kosko_B_Neural_Networks_and_Fuzzy_Systems_A_Dynamical_Systems_Approach_to_Machine_Intelligence_PHI","5576551_Learning_and_Tuning_Fuzzy_Logic_Controllers_Through_Reinforcements","5576548_Multilayer_perceptron_fuzzy_sets_and_classification","3563535_Simple_direct_adaptive_fuzzy_controller_derived_from_its_neural_equivalent","3529919_Linguistic_interpretation_of_self-organizing_maps","3529821_A_learning_method_of_fuzzy_inference_rules_by_descent_method","3335600_Fuzzy_min-max_neural_networks_--_Part_2_Clustering","3113724_Fuzzy_logic_in_control_systems_Fuzzy_logic_controller_-_Part_I","3113707_Fuzzy_Logic_in_Control_Systems","3043398_Fuzzy_Systems_as_Universal_Approximators"]}
