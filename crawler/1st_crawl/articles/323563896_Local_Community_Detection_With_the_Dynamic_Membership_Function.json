{"id":"323563896_Local_Community_Detection_With_the_Dynamic_Membership_Function","abstract":"Most community detection methods require the global information of the original network to be available, however it is often expensive (even no way) to obtain the global information of the network in many real-world networks. So the local community detection only based on the local information becomes especially important. The local community is the community in the network to which a given starting node belongs. Some local community detection methods have been proposed. However, these methods did not consider the characteristics of the local community during the local community formation. In this paper, we analysis the formation of the local community and propose two local community detection algorithms based on the dynamic membership function. Each of the algorithms is divided into three stages: (1) the initial stage, (2) the middle stage and (3) the closing stage. At the initial stage, we design a dynamical membership function to detect local community and nodes with the greatest neighborhood intersect rate could be added to the local community. At the middle stage, we design another dynamical membership function, and the goal of this stage is to make the connection of the node in the local community closest. At the closing stage, the third dynamical membership function is provided, and the local community is further improved by collecting some nodes that should not be omitted. We test our algorithms on several synthetic datasets and real datasets, the results show that the local communities detected by our method are closer to the real local communities.","authors":["Wenjian Luo","Daofu Zhang","Hao Jiang","Li Ni"],"meta":["March 2018IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TFUZZ.2018.2812148","Project: Local Community Detection"],"references":["248519014_An_Information_Flow_Model_for_Conflict_and_Fission_in_Small_Groups1","230641383_Enhancing_community_detection_using_a_network_weighting_strategy","221273566_Local_Community_Identification_in_Social_Networks","220489412_Towards_Linear_Time_Overlapping_Community_Detection_in_Social_Networks","8967335_The_emergent_properties_of_a_dolphin_social_network","6704294_Modular_organization_of_protein_interaction_networks","1910341_Detecting_the_overlapping_and_hierarchical_community_structure_in_complex_networks","344125515_Defining_and_evaluating_network_communities_based_on_ground-truth","319633422_Community_Detection_by_Fuzzy_Relations","313580340_Learning_Community_Structures_Global_and_Local_Perspectives","302520223_Dynamic-Fuzzy_Concepts","301976986_From_a_Local_to_a_Global_Perspective_of_Community_Detection_in_Networks","296691009_A_multiobjective_evolutionary_algorithm_to_find_community_structures_based_on_affinity_propagation","282490616_Community_discovery_by_propagating_local_and_global_information_based_on_the_MapReduce_model","278699954_Survey_on_Social_Community_Detection","273397980_Large-scale_community_detection_based_on_node_membership_grade_and_sub-communities_integration","267640978_Community_detection_by_fuzzy_clustering","257218961_Community_detection_based_on_modularity_and_an_improved_genetic_algorithm","257218829_Detecting_local_community_structure_in_complex_networks_based_on_local_degree_central_nodes","253253918_Detecting_Community_Structure_in_Networks","232771086_Uncovering_the_overlapping_community_structure_of_complex_networks_in_nature_and_society","229364975_Dynamical_membership_functions_An_approach_for_adaptive_fuzzy_modelling","222863527_Attention_to_time_in_fuzzy_logic","222846071_Identification_of_Overlapping_Community_Structure_in_Complex_Networks_using_Fuzzy_C-means_Clustering","222011590_Identification_of_overlapping_and_non-overlapping_community_structure_by_fuzzy_clustering_in_complex_networks","221945992_Community_structure_in_social_and_biological_networks","221654226_SCAN_A_Structural_Clustering_Algorithm_for_Networks","221607418_A_Graph_Based_Approach_to_Extract_a_Neighborhood_Customer_Community_for_Collaborative_Filtering","221544472_A_method_for_local_community_detection_by_finding_maximal-degree_nodes","220788144_Extracting_Local_Community_Structure_from_Local_Cores","220298580_Exploring_Local_Community_Structures_in_Large_Networks","45854744_Community_Detection_in_Graphs","23464007_Benchmark_graphs_for_testing_community_detection_algorithms","7659762_Finding_and_Evaluating_Community_Structure_in_Networks","7567786_Clauset_A_Finding_local_community_structure_in_networks_Phys_Rev_E_72_026132","6584052_Clustering_by_Passing_Messages_Between_Data_Points","4196222_A_dynamic_fuzzy_logic_approach_to_adaptive_HVS-based_watermarking","2382087_On_Network-Aware_Clustering_of_Web_Clients","1896104_Evaluating_Local_Community_Methods_in_Networks"]}
