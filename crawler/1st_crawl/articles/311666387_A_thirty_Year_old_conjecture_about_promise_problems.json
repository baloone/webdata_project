{"id":"311666387_A_thirty_Year_old_conjecture_about_promise_problems","abstract":"Even, Selman, and Yacobi (Even et al. in Inf Control 61(2):159–173, 1984, Selman and Yacobi in Proceedings of the 8th international colloquium on automata, languages, and programming, volume 140 of lecture notes in computer science. Springer, Berlin, pp 502–509, 1982) formulated a conjecture that in current terminology asserts that there do not exist disjoint NP-pairs all of whose separators are NP-hard via Turing reductions. In this paper, we consider a variant of this conjecture—there do not exist disjoint NP-pairs all of whose separators are NP-hard via bounded-truth-table reductions. We provide evidence for this conjecture. We also observe that if the original conjecture holds, then some of the known probabilistic public-key cryptosystems are not NP-hard to crack.","authors":["Andrew Hughes","Debasis Mandal","Aduri Pavan","Nathan Russell"],"meta":["December 2016computational complexity 25(4):883-919","DOI:10.1007/s00037-015-0107-6"],"references":["266516458_Degrees_of_models","262359011_A_Thirty_Year_Old_Conjecture_about_Promise_Problems","256555078_Diagonalizations_over_polynomial_time_computable_sets","235008638_Graph_Nonisomorphism_Has_Subexponential_Size_Proofs_Unless_The_Polynomial-Time_Hierarchy_Collapses","223018611_On_Reducibility_and_Symmetry_of_Disjoint_NP-Pairs","222750240_Cook_versus_Karp-Levin_Separating_completeness_notions_if_NP_is_not_small","222555934_Canonical_disjoint_NP-pairs_of_propositional_proof_systems","222492644_Genericity_and_measure_for_exponential_time","222439046_Probabilistic_Encryption","222259586_The_Complexity_of_Promise_Problems_with_Applications_to_Public-Key_Cryptography","221580572_One-Way_Functions_and_the_Berman-Hartmanis_Conjecture","222039089_Resource_bounded_randomness_and_weakly_complete_problems","221591366_Fully_Homomorphic_Encryption_Using_Ideal_Lattices","221351346_On_Promise_Problems_A_Survey","220898739_The_Complexity_of_Promise_Problems"]}
