{"id":"325200469_Exploring_EFL_Learners'_Self-Efficacy_in_Academic_Writing_Based_on_Process-Genre_Approach","abstract":"This study explores the change of EFL learners’ level of self-efficacy in process-genre academic writing instruction. The teaching experiment was conducted for 14 weeks. A total of 59 graduate students participated in the experiment. Before the experiment, the results showed that the general level of EFL graduates’ self-efficacy in academic writing was relatively low. After 14 weeks of academic writing instruction conducted by the process-genre approach, participants’ self-efficacy improved significantly. In the interview, participants also reported an increasing level of confidence in academic writing. Based on the findings, implications of academic writing instruction to improve students’ self-efficacy are discussed in the paper.","authors":["Ying Zhang"],"meta":["May 2018English Language Teaching 11(6):115","DOI:10.5539/elt.v11n6p115"],"references":["323541304_Genre-based_L2_writing_instruction_and_writing-specific_psychological_factors_The_dynamics_of_change","316459391_Self-Efficacy_Beliefs_and_General_Mental_Ability_in_Mathematical_Problem-Solving","291868825_Genre_in_the_classroom_A_linguistic_approach","345850175_English_in_Today's_Research_World_A_Writing_Guide","323880204_Teachers'_self-efficacy_for_writing","321434749_Using_mind_maps_to_reveal_and_develop_genre_knowledge_in_a_graduate_writing_course","312954849_The_Role_of_Input_Enhancement_in_Developing_Pragmatic_Competence","287238209_A_Synthesis_of_Research_on_Second_Language_Writing_in_English","285831994_Self-Efficacy_The_Exercise_of_Control","281465451_Analyzing_Genre_Exemplars_in_Preparation_for_Writing_The_Case_of_an_L2_Graduate_Student_in_the_ESP_Genre-based_Instructional_Framework_of_Academic_Literacy"]}
