{"id":"255671396_Iris_Based_Recognition_System_Using_Wavelet_Transform","abstract":"Iris recognition is known as an inherently reliable technique for human identification. Feature extraction is a crucial step for iris recognition and important task. The extracted features are used for matching. Different wavelet transforms have been used by different researchers for feature extraction in iris recognition. Also many researchers extract features using different coefficient such has horizontal, vertical, diagonal or combination of them. In this work we have used SCOE-Iris v.1 database consisting of 2750 images, acquired in the signal processing laboratory at Sinhgad College of Engineering, Pune, India. In this work different basis wavelet are used for feature extraction and their performance is evaluated. The optimal wavelet transform is determined. Experimental results show that this algorithm are efficient and gives acceptable accuracy","authors":["Sandipan Pralhad Narote","Abhilasha S. Narote","Laxman M.
