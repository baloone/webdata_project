{"id":"257704959_On_the_repetitive_collection_indexing_problem","abstract":"In large data sets such as genomes from a single species, large sets of reads, and version control data it is often noted that each entry only differs from another by a very small number of variations. This leads to a large set of data with a great deal of redundancy and repetitiveness. Rapid development in DNA sequencing technologies has caused a drastic growth in the size of publicly available sequence databases with such data. DNA sequencing has become so fast and cost-effective that sequencing individual genomes will soon become a common task [9] making querying and storing such sets of data an important task. In this paper, we propose an indexing structure for highly repetitive collections of sequence data based on a multilevel g-gram model. In particular, the proposed algorithm accommodates variations that may occur in the target sequence with respect to the reference sequence. The paper is organized as follows. Section [1] and [2] introduce the basic concepts and go through the related literature. In Section [3] we present notions and facts. Details of the proposed data structure/algorithm will be given in Section [5] and [4], Section [6] discusses complexity analysis and Section [7] gives conclusions of future work.","authors":["Ali Alatabbi","Carl Barton","Costas Iliopoulos"],"meta":["October 2012","DOI:10.1109/BIBMW.2012.6470220","Conference: BIBM Workshops"],"references":["235689162_Querying_highly_similar_sequences","3245068_Graph_Database_Systems","257705049_Querying_Highly_Similar_Structured_Sequences_via_Binary_Encoding_and_Word_Level_Operations","228455667_A_genome_compression_algorithm_supporting_manipulation","225682144_Indexing_Similar_DNA_Sequences","224103840_Efficient_randomized_pattern-matching_algorithms","222469107_Approximate_string-matching_with_Q-grams_and_maximal_matches","221204524_An_algorithm_for_mapping_short_reads_to_a_dynamically_changing_genomic_sequence","220787574_Indexing_DNA_Sequences_Using_q-Grams","220555899_Algorithms_on_Stings_Trees_and_Sequences_Computer_Science_and_Computational_Biology","220224582_Approximate_String_Matching_with_Suffix_Automata","51993442_A_Mathematical_Theory_of_Communication","47935143_Storage_and_Retrieval_of_Individual_Genomes","13988269_The_Mathematical_Theory_of_Communication","2375410_A_Guided_Tour_to_Approximate_String_Matching"]}
