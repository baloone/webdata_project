{"id":"279808591_Optimal_Linear_Bernoulli_Factories_for_Small_Mean_Problems","abstract":"Suppose a coin with unknown probability $p$ of heads can be flipped as often\nas desired. A Bernoulli factory for a function $f$ is an algorithm that uses\nflips of the coin together with auxiliary randomness to flip a single coin with\nprobability $f(p)$ of heads. Applications include near perfect sampling from\nthe stationary distribution of regenerative processes. When $f$ is analytic,\nthe problem can be reduced to a Bernoulli factory of the form $f(p) = Cp$ for\nconstant $C$. Presented here is a new algorithm where for small values of $Cp$,\nrequires roughly only $C$ coin flips to generate a $Cp$ coin. From information\ntheory considerations, this is also conjectured to be (to first order) the\nminimum number of flips needed by any such algorithm.\nFor $Cp$ large, the new algorithm can also be used to build a new Bernoulli\nfactory that uses only 80\\% of the expected coin flips of the older method, and\napplies to the more general problem of a multivariate Bernoulli factory, where\nthere are $k$ coins, the $k$th coin has unknown probability $p_k$ of heads, and\nthe goal is to simulate a coin flip with probability $C_1 p_1 + \\cdots + C_k\np_k$ of heads.","authors":["Mark Huber"],"meta":["June 2017Methodology and Computing in Applied Probability 19(2)","DOI:10.1007/s11009-016-9518-3","SourcearXiv"],"references":["264160764_Perfect_simulation_using_atomic_regeneration_with_application_to_Sequential_Monte_Carlo","255687596_Nearly_Optimal_Bernoulli_Factories_for_Linear_Functions","220136500_Stationarity_Detection_in_the_Initial_Transient_Problem","38340192_Fast_simulation_of_new_coins_from_old","271512855_Mathematical_Statistics","227704985_Simulating_Events_of_Unknown_Probabilities_via_Reverse_Time_Martingales","220136327_A_Bernoulli_Factory","3397081_New_fast_method_for_generating_discrete_random_numbers_with_arbitrary_frequency_distributions"]}
