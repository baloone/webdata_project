{"id":"276491925_The_Equivalent_Conversion_between_Regular_Grammar_and_Finite_Automata","abstract":"The equivalence exists between regular grammar and finite automata in accepting languages. Some complicated conversion algorithms have also been in existence. The simplified forms of the algorithms and their proofs are given. And the construction algorithm 5 of the equivalent conversion from finite automata to left linear grammar is presented as well as its correctness proof. Additionally, a relevant example is expounded.","authors":["Jielan Zhang","Zhongsheng Qian"],"meta":["January 2013Journal of Software Engineering and Applications 06(01):33-37","DOI:10.4236/jsea.2013.61005"],"references":["342318085_Regular_Expressions_into_Finite_Automata","267801728_Syntax-Tree_Regular_Expression_Based_DFA_Formal_Construction","3871332_NFAs_with_tagged_transitions_their_conversion_to_deterministic_automata_and_application_to_regular_expressions","274079001_An_Introduction_to_Formal_Languages_and_Automata","228057764_Introduction_To_Automata_Theory_Languages_And_Computation","223140280_Grammar_theory_based_on_lattice-ordered_monoid","222636326_Observations_on_the_complexity_of_regular_expression_problems","220617224_On_the_Equivalence_and_Containment_Problems_for_Unambiguous_Regular_Expressions_Regular_Grammars_and_Finite_Automata","50946196_Construction_of_a_Minimal_Deterministic_Finite_Automaton_from_a_Regular_Expression","2890673_A_General_Weighted_Grammar_Library"]}
