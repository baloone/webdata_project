We obtain bounds of (p, q)-Bernstein operators. Further we prove that if a continuous function admits an analytic continuation into the disk {z : |z| ≤ ρ}, then B n p,q (g; z) → g(z) (n → ∞) uniformly on any compact set in the given disk {z : |z| ≤ ρ}, ρ > 0. In 1912, S.N. Bernstein [4] defined the famous polynomial known as Bernstein polynomial to prove the Weierstrasss approximation theorem. Due to the fine properties of approximation, convergence and shape preserving, Bernstein polynomials play an important role in approximation theory as well as in analysis, geometry and computer science etc. Lupas [11] was the first who introduced the q-analogue of well known Bernstein polynomial and investigated its approximation and later various properties of q-Bernstein operators were handled by Phillip [22, 23]. The approximation properties of q-generalization of other operators were studied by several authors. Recently, Mursaleen et al. [15] applied (p, q)-calculus in approximation theory and introduced the (p, q)-analogue of","authors":["Mohammad Mursaleen","Faisal Khan","Mohd Saif"],"meta":["June 2019The Korean Journal of Mathematics 27(2):505-514","DOI:10.11568/kjm.2019.27.2.505"],"references":["329583081_Improved_approximation_and_error_estimations_by_King_type_p_q_-Szasz-Mirakjan_Kantorovich_operators","329438928_Approximation_by_quaternion_pqpq-Bernstein_polynomials_and_Voronovskaja_type_result_on_compact_disk","329389176_Convergence_of_iterates_of_q-Bernstein_and_p_q-Bernstein_operators_and_the_Kelisky-Rivlin_type_theorem","328599154_The_Dunkl_generalization_of_Stancu_type_q-Szasz-Mirakjan-Kantorovich_operators_and_some_approximation_results","319912584_Chlodowsky_type_generalization_of_p_q-Szasz_operators_involving_Brenke_type_polynomials","311358888_Weighted_statistical_convergence_based_on_generalized_difference_operator_involving_pq-Gamma_function_and_its_applications_to_approximation_theorems","303713140_On_weighted_statistical_convergence_based_on_pq-integers_and_related_approximation_theorems_for_functions_of_two_variables","299657197_Approximation_by_p_q-Lorentz_Polynomials_on_a_Compact_Disk","316134838_On_pq-analogue_of_divided_differences_and_Bernstein_operators","303131584_Bernstein_polynomials_based_on_the_q-integers_the_heritage_of_P_L_Chebyshev_A_Festschrift_in_honor_of_the_70th_birthday_of_T"]}
