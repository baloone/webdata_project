{"id":"220613020_Women_in_computing_around_the_world","abstract":"This paper describes the participation of women in computing in more than 30 countries, by focussing on participation at undergraduate level. A brief discussion covers how societal and cultural factors may affect women's participation. Statistics from many different sources are presented for comparison. Generally, participation is low --- most countries fall in the 10-40% range with a few below 10% and a few above 40%.","authors":["Vashti Galpin"],"meta":["June 2002ACM SIGCSE Bulletin 34(2):94-100","DOI:10.1145/543812.543839","SourceDBLP"],"references":["262120654_Treading_the_Hallowed_Halls_Women_in_Higher_Education_in_India","221538634_Women_in_introductory_computer_science_Experience_at_Victoria_University_of_Wellington","221266676_The_Influence_of_Feminist_Theory_On_Informatics_Course_Design","312993362_Information_Technology_Gender_and_Employment_A_Case_Study_of_the_Telecommunications_Industry_in_Malaysia","297669655_WOMEN_IN_SCIENCE_94_-_SURPRISES_ACROSS_THE_CULTURAL_DIVIDE","291050471_Women_in_computing","290062142_Exploring_the_pipeline","274476759_Women_in_introductory_computer_science","262951467_Information_Technology_and_Gender_Equality","248462772_Women_in_IT-what_are_the_barriers","247823830_The_cultural_context_of_gendered_science_a_theoretical_model_derived_from_studies_in_India","246473521_Information_technology_women_in_developing_countriesa_Brazilian_perspective","243774627_Technological_experience_and_technophobia_in_South_African_university_students","242818706_Undergraduate_students'_use_of_information_communicated_during_e-mail_tutorials","240419844_WIT_the_Singaporean_way","235699835_Current_Education_Statistics_-_Universities_and_Colleges_-_Key_figures_2000","232545401_The_Psychological_Impact_of_Technology_from_a_Global_Perspective_A_Study_of_Technological_Sophistication_and_Technophobia_in_University_Students_from_Twenty-Three_Countries","223382401_Gender_and_Computing_A_Decade_of_Change","222388363_Gender_and_computers_Similarities_and_differences_in_Iranian_college_students'_attitudes_toward_computers","221538899_Attracting_women_to_tertiary_computing_courses","221266655_Computer_Self_Efficacy_And_Gender","221094329_Gender_Bias_The_East-West_Paradox","220613368_Exploring_the_pipeline_towards_an_understanding_of_the_male_dominated_computing_culture_and_its_influence_on_women","220612618_Women_in_computing_What_does_the_data_show","220478735_Computing_as_a_discipline","220423905_Situations_and_Advancement_Measures_in_Germany","220421292_Australian_women_in_IT","44828296_Scientific_technical_and_vocational_education_of_girls_in_Africa_summary_of_21_national_reports"]}
