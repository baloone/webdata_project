{"id":"220549005_On_the_irregularity_strength_of_trees","abstract":"For any graph G, let n(i) be the number of vertices of degree I, and lambda(G) = max(iless than or equal toj) {n(i)+(...)+n(i)+i-1/j}. This is a general lower bound on the irregularity strength of graph G. All known facts suggest that for connected graphs, this is the actual irregularity strength up to an additive constant. In fact, this was conjectured to be the truth for regular graphs and for trees. Here we find an infinite sequence of trees with lambda(T) = n(1) but strength converging to 11-root5/8 n(1).
