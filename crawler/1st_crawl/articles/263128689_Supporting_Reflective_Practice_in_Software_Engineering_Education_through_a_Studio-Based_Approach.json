{"id":"263128689_Supporting_Reflective_Practice_in_Software_Engineering_Education_through_a_Studio-Based_Approach","abstract":"Learning is a lifelong process, especially in the fast-paced software industry. In addition to formal training courses, good software developers continually learn by reflecting on what they've done in the past. However, reflective practice is rarely taught explicitly in university software engineering education. One way to teach reflective techniques from the start is through studio-based learning.","authors":["Christopher Neil Bull","Jon Whittle"],"meta":["July 2014IEEE Software 31(4):44-50","DOI:10.1109/MS.2014.52","Project: Studios in Software Engineering Education (PhD)"],"references":["239918298_Metamorphosis_Transforming_Non-designers_into_Designers","236165289_Studios_in_Software_Engineering_Education_Towards_an_Evaluable_Model","317597473_Facilitating_Reflective_Learning_in_Higher_Education","305295593_Teaching_software_development_in_a_studio_environment","240327376_The_Reflective_Practitioner_How_Profes-sionals_Think_in_Action_Basic_Books","238162544_A_Review_of_Research_on_Project-Based_Learning","221538918_Teaching_software_development_in_a_studio_environment","220376890_The_reflective_practitioner_perspective_in_software_engineering_education","215439083_The_Reflective_Practitioner_How_Professionals_Think_In_Action","30874809_Educating_The_Reflective_Practitioner"]}
