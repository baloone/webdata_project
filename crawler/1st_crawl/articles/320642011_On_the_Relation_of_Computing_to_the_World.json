{"id":"320642011_On_the_Relation_of_Computing_to_the_World","abstract":"I survey a common theme that pervades the philosophy of computer science (and philosophy more generally): the relation of computing to the world. Are algorithms merely certain procedures entirely characterizable in an “indigenous,” “internal,’ “intrinsic,” “local,” “narrow,” “syntactic” (more generally: “intra-system”), purely-Turing-machine language? Or must algorithms interact with the real world, having a purpose that is expressible only in a language with an “external,” “extrinsic,” “global,” “wide,” “inherited” (more generally: “extra” or “inter-“system) semantics?","authors":["William Rapaport"],"meta":["October 2017","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-61043-6_3","In book: Philosophy and Computing (pp.29-64)"],"references":["289014410_Semiotic_Systems_Computers_and_the_Mind","333191037_Turing's_Oracle_From_Absolute_to_Relative_Computability_-_and_Back","319770401_Vision_A_Computational_Investigation_into_the_Human_Representation_and_Processing_of_Visual_Information","319448594_Interactive_computing_and_relativized_computability","313086377_Mental_models_in_cognitive_science","304405348_On_computable_numbers_with_an_application_to_the_Entscheidungsproblem","302221193_Methodological_solipsism_considered_as_a_research_strategy_in_cognitive_psychology","298271618_Is_the_universe_a_computer_Reply","286298791_A_Philosophy_of_Material_Culture_Action_Function_and_Mind","285881613_Interactive_computing_and_relativized_computability"]}
