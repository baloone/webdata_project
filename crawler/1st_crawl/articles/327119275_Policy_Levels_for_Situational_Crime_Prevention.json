{"id":"327119275_Policy_Levels_for_Situational_Crime_Prevention","abstract":"An organizing framework is useful for scientific progress as well as the application of knowledge in practical situations. This article advocates supplementing the classification of situational crime prevention methods, proposing seven levels of classification for how crime prevention policy is applied. The seven levels are organized by distance from the criminal event, and examples of application are offered in liquor control and auto theft reduction.
