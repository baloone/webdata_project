{"id":"2113744_On_the_postulation_of_sd_fat_points_in_Pd","abstract":"In connection with his counter-example to the fourteenth problem of Hilbert, Nagata formulated a conjecture concerning the postulation of r fat points of the same multiplicity in the projective plane and proved it when r is a square. Iarrobino formulated a similar conjecture in any projective space P^d. We prove Iarrobino's conjecture when r is a d-th power. As a corollary, we obtain new counter-examples modeled on those by Nagata.","authors":["Laurent Evain"],"meta":["August 2004Journal of Algebra 285(2)","DOI:10.1016/j.jalgebra.2004.09.034","SourcearXiv"],"references":["226981536_On_the_Symmetric_Product_of_a_Curve_with_General_Moduli","44235587_On_a_degeneration_of_the_symmetric_product_of_a_curve_with_general_moduli","268681253_On_the_14th_problem_of_Hilbert","260919040_On_a_class_of_special_linear_systems_of_P3","259034941_Symplectic_packings_and_algebraic_geometry_with_an_Appendix_by_Y_Karshon","256844884_A_Treatise_on_the_Fourteenth_Problem_of_Hilbert","243111660_Ample_line_bundles_on_smooth_surfaces","243019714_Inverse_System_of_a_Symbolic_Power_II_The_Waring_Problem_for_Forms","240150390_On_the_14-th_problem_of_Hilbert","239786498_On_the_14-th_Problem_of_Hilbert","239786445_On_rational_surfaces_II","233555817_Inverse_system_of_a_symbolic_power_III_Thin_algebras_and_fat_points","226084215_La_Methode_d1Horace_pour_l'Interpolation_Plusieurs_Variables"]}
