{"id":"265677369_Some_Combinatorial_Properties_of_Factorial_Languages","abstract":"A language L over a finite alphabet A is factorial if each factor (or subword) of any word of L still belongs to L. Typical examples of factorial languages are those formed by all finite factors of a given set of infinite words. In this case the language satisfies the important property that any word of L can be prolonged, in at least one direction, in the language.","authors":["Aldo de Luca","Stefano Varricchio"],"meta":["January 1990","DOI:10.1007/978-1-4612-3352-7_20"],"references":["281793182_Combinatorics_on_Words","280681347_Une_caracterisation_des_ensembles_sofiques","256555077_Systemes_codes_Coded_systems","243018254_On_the_burnside_problem_for_semigroups","232346488_On_cube-free_o-words_generated_by_binary_morphisms","226071522_Permutation_properties_and_the_fibonacci_semigroup","223111360_Some_combinatorial_properties_of_the_Thue-Morse_sequence_and_a_problem_in_semigroups","220165872_A_combinatorial_theorem_on_p-power-free_words_and_an_application_to_semigroups","220148230_Infinite_Words_with_Linear_Subword_Complexity","220115400_On_the_Subword_Complexity_of_D0L_Languages_with_a_Constant_Distribution","220114730_Factorial_Languages_Whose_Growth_Function_is_Quadratically_Upper_Bounded","220111546_On_the_Factors_of_the_Thue-Morse_Word_on_Three_Symbols"]}
