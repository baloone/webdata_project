{"id":"322110220_Complex_system_tacit_knowledge_extraction_trough_a_formal_method","abstract":"A complex system integrates multiple sub-systems and contains both knowledge in each sub-system and in their connections. This paper aims to present the relational concept analysis as a method to extract “connection” knowledge as much as the sub-system contained knowledge. A use case from neurology to validate the approach is introduced. A brain is a system that can be studied through different clinical examinations, therefore each clinical examination can be considered as a sub-system.","authors":["Mickael Wijnberg","Mario Lezoche","Blondin Alexandre Massé","Petko Valtchev"],"meta":["December 2017Insight 20(4):23-26","DOI:10.1002/inst.12176","Project: Relational Concept Analysis"],"references":["279928616_Interoperability_as_a_Key_Concept_for_the_Control_and_Evolution_of_the_System_of_Systems_SoS","268022769_A_fast_compound_algorithm_for_mining_generators_closed_itemsets_and_computing_links_between_equivalence_classes","257514875_Relational_Concept_Analysis_Mining_Concept_Lattices_From_Multi-Relational_Data","281884527_Extraction_de_concepts_et_de_relations_en_analyse_relationnelle_de_concepts_ARC","279347205_Formal_Concept_Analysis","269031740_Semantics_Enactment_in_Enterprise_Information_Systems","248114875_Topics_in_Interoperability_System-of-Systems_Evolution","237132799_Restructuring_lattice_theory_an_approach_based_on_lattices_of_concepts","222028291_Concept_lattices_and_conceptual_knowledge_systems","220693390_Romano_G_Concept_Data_Analysis_Theory_and_Applications_Wiley_New_York"]}
