{"id":"350547529_Toward_a_Quantum_Software_Engineering","abstract":"Nowadays, we are at the dawn of a new age, the quantum era. Quantum computing\nis no longer a dream; it is a reality that needs to be adopted. But this new\ntechnology is taking its first steps, so we still do not have models, standards, or\nmethods to help us in the creation of new systems and the migration of current\nones. Given the current state of quantum computing, we need to go back to the\npath software engineering took in the last century to achieve the new golden age\nfor quantum software engineering.","authors":["Mario Piattini","Jose Luis Hevia Oliver","Ricardo PÃ©rez-Castillo","Manuel A.
