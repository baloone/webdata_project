A model of advanced professional training and practical studies was suggested for industrial enterprise employees based on federal or national research universities. Suggested model enables to intensify integration of applied and fundamental science and bring competitive domestic projects in different spheres into common use in industry. It also makes it possible to form a unique industry-specific research and educational environment in the field of chemistry and technology based on training of scientific brainpower and industrial personnel; and to assist modernization of industry. Educational systems have higher social and economic characteristics than the corresponding autonomic structures; therefore the model is an innovation in the continuous professional education.","authors":["Mansur F.
