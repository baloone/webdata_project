{"id":"353578704_Quantum_algorithm_for_MMNG-based_DBSCAN","abstract":"DBSCAN is a famous density-based clustering algorithm that can discover clusters with arbitrary shapes without the minimal requirements of domain knowledge to determine the input parameters. However, DBSCAN is not suitable for databases with different local-density clusters and is also a very time-consuming clustering algorithm. In this paper, we present a quantum mutual MinPts -nearest neighbor graph (MMNG)-based DBSCAN algorithm. The proposed algorithm performs better on databases with different local-density clusters. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm has a dramatic increase in speed compared to its classic counterpart.","authors":["Xuming Xie","Longzhen Duan","Taorong Qiu","Junru Li"],"meta":["July 2021Scientific Reports 11(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-021-95156-7"],"references":["342380016_Superconducting_Quantum_Computing_A_Review","337994002_Superconducting_Qubits_Current_State_of_Play","333832447_A_quantum_engineer's_guide_to_superconducting_qubits","319251548_Quantum_Algorithm_for_K-Nearest_Neighbors_Classification_Based_on_the_Metric_of_Hamming_Distance","304806652_Systematic_and_integrative_analysis_of_large_gene_lists_using_DAVID_bioinformatics_resources","303486292_Quantum_algorithm_for_association_rules_mining","333462373_Trapped-ion_quantum_computing_Progress_and_challenges","318824536_Quantum_algorithm_for_linear_regression","307525218_Prediction_by_linear_regression_on_a_quantum_computer","298332569_Spike_sorting_for_large_dense_electrode_arrays","291942453_Simulating_Physics_with_Computers","280821144_Polynomial-Time_Algorithms_for_Prime_Factorization_and_Discrete_Logarithms_on_a_Quantum_Computer","275355626_Experimental_Realization_of_a_Quantum_Support_Vector_Machine","266561032_Experimental_Realization_of_a_Quantum_Support_Vector_Machine","261718080_Exact_algorithms_for_problems_related_to_the_densest_k-set_problem"]}
