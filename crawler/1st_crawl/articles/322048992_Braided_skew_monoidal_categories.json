{"id":"322048992_Braided_skew_monoidal_categories","abstract":"We introduce the notion of a braiding on a skew monoidal category, whose curious feature is that the defining isomorphisms involve three objects rather than two. These braidings are shown to arise from, and classify, cobraidings (also known as coquasitriangular structures) on bialgebras. Using a multicategorical approach we also describe examples of braidings on skew monoidal categories arising from 2-category theory.","authors":["John Bourke","Stephen Lack"],"meta":["December 2017"],"references":["224872314_Skew_monoidales_skew_warpings_and_quantum_categories","321967087_Free_skew_monoidal_categories","282692748_Skew_structures_in_2-category_theory_and_homotopy_theory","266979010_Quantum_groups_A_path_to_current_algebra","256647422_Braided_Tensor_Categories","225075003_Skew-closed_categories","222519313_Pseudo-commutative_monads_and_pseudo-closed_2-categories","221659492_Skew-monoidal_categories_and_bialgebroids","44461089_Quantum_groups_Christian_Kassel"]}
