{"id":"276535174_Conceptual_Spaces_and_the_Consequences_of_Category_Spanning","abstract":"A general finding in economic and organizational sociology shows that objects that span categories lose appeal to audiences. This paper argues that the negative consequences of crossing boundaries are more severe when the categories spanned are distant and have high contrast. Available empirical strategies do not incorporate information on the distances among categories. Here we introduce novel measures of distance in conceptual space and derive measures for typicality, category contrast, and categorical niche width. Using the proposed measurement approach, we test our theory using data on online reviews of books and restaurants.","authors":["Balazs Kovacs","Michael Hannan"],"meta":["May 2015Sociological Science 2(13):252-286","DOI:10.15195/v2.a13"],"references":["278029063_The_Categorical_Imperative_And_Structural_Reproduction_Dynamics_Of_Technological_Entry_In_The_Semiconductor_Industry","275623617_Out_of_Sight_Out_of_Mind_Evidence_of_Perceptual_Factors_in_the_Multiple-Category_Discount","275491400_Dilettante_or_Renaissance_Person_How_the_Order_of_Job_Experiences_Affects_Hiring_in_an_External_Labor_Market","275450712_Contrasting_alternative_explanations_for_the_consequences_of_category_spanning_A_study_of_restaurant_reviews_and_menus_in_San_Francisco","273089346_An_Ecology_of_Social_Categories","261851476_Actual_and_Perceptual_Effects_of_Category_Spanning","278029327_The_Categorical_Imperative_And_Structural_Reproduction_Dynamics_Of_Technological_Entry_In_The_Semiconductor_Industry","274706889_Culture_and_Cognition","273034598_Emergence_of_Market_Orders_Audience_Interaction_and_Vanguard_Influence","254397051_Apples_to_Oranges_How_Category_Overlap_Facilitates_Commensuration_in_an_Online_Market_Environment"]}
