{"id":"321256373_Water_Level_Measurement_Altitude_Trainer_Integrated_With_Human_Machine_Interface","abstract":"This research aims to design a trainer simulator wake height of the water level measurement using microcontroller arduino mega integrated with Human Machine Interface (HMI). This tool is designed to describe a working system of water level elevation measurements as a learning medium HMI. By using a microcontroller arduino mega, all processes in both input and output can be integrated to the HMI using a 7-inch LCD screen.","authors":["Ade Gafar Abdullah","Agung Pramudiantoro Putra"],"meta":["September 2017","DOI:10.17509/ijost.v2i2.8019"],"references":["321258574_Determination_of_Economic_Order_Quantity_in_a_fuzzy_EOQ_Model_using_of_GMIR_Deffuzification","320297847_Mitochondrial_Biogenesis_Induced_by_Exercise_and_Nutrients_Implication_for_Performance_and_Health_Benefits","313547207_Module-Scale_Simulation_of_Forward_Osmosis_Module-Part_A_Plate-and-Frame","302901343_Sludge_Dewatering_Process_Control_Using_Principal_Component_Analysis_PCA_and_Partial_Least_Square_PLS","271258009_Automation_of_Tank_Level_Using_Plc_and_Establishment_of_Hmi_by_Scada","3267147_Design_Development_and_Commissioning_of_a_Supervisory_Control_and_Data_Acquisition_SCADA_Laboratory_for_Research_and_Training","311164659_Heavy-Ion_Micro_Beam_and_Simulation_Study_of_a_Flash-Based_FPGA_Microcontroller_Implementation","265555676_Cooperative_Development_of_an_Arduino-Compatible_Building_Automation_System_for_the_Practical_Teaching_of_Electronics","224597097_Microcontroller-Based_Experimental_Setup_and_Experiments_for_SCADA_Education"]}
