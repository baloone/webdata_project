{"id":"295856110_Cost_Bounds_and_Approximation_Ratios_of_Multicast_Light-trees_in_WDM_Networks","abstract":"The construction of light-trees is one of the principal subproblems for all-optical multicast routing (AOMR) in sparse splitting Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) networks. Due to the light splitting constraint and the absence of wavelength converters, several light-trees may be required to establish a multicast session. However, the computation of the cost-optimal multicast light-trees is NP-hard. In this paper, first we study the cost bounds of the light-trees built for a multicast session in unweighted WDM networks. Then, partially based on this result, the approximation ratios of some classical multicast light-tree computation algorithms, i.e., Reroute-to-Source (R2S) and Member-Only(MO) algorithms are derived in both unweighted and non-equally weighted WDM networks. Moreover, integer linearprogramming (ILP) formulations are introduced and carried out to search the optimal light-trees for multicast routing.The cost bounds and approximation ratios of R2S and MO algorithms in some candidate WDM backbone networks are examined through simulations.","authors":["Fen Zhou","Miklos Molnar","Bernard A.
