{"id":"281050669_DDART_a_Dynamic_Dashboard_for_Collection_Analysis_and_Visualization_of_Activity_and_Reporting_Traces","abstract":"Most Learning Management Systems (LMS) focus on providing rich learning materials to the learners but rarely offer possibilities to monitor and analyze their learning processes. However metacognitive strategies argue that learners can improve their learning performances by monitoring their activities, especially in the context of Project-Based Learning (PBL). Our work consists in designing tools to support metacognitive strategies. In this paper, a framework and a dynamic dashboard for PBL situations are proposed to help learners to collect, analyze and visualize the meaningful traces of their activities by them-selves. The proposed framework integrates activity traces (interactions with the LMS) and reporting traces (semi-structured sentences written by the learners). The dynamic dashboard supports learners in the creation customizable indicators through a user-friendly interface.","authors":["Min Ji","Christine Michel","Elise Lavoué","Sébastien George"],"meta":["September 2014","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-11200-8_39","Conference: European Conference on Technology Enhanced Learning"],"references":["262289933_A_Dashboard_to_Regulate_Project-Based_Learning","261244596_An_Architecture_to_Combine_Activity_Traces_and_Reporting_Traces_to_Support_Self-Regulation_Processes","260299045_TrAVis_to_Enhance_Students'_Self-Monitoring_in_Online_Learning_Supported_by_Computer-Mediated_Communication_Tools","259195582_Feeler_Feel_good_and_learn_better_A_tool_for_promoting_reflection_about_learning_and_Well-being","228685389_Indicators_computation_from_modeled_traces_in_the_context_of_computer_Human_Learning_environment","222020078_CourseVis_A_graphical_student_monitoring_tool_for_supporting_instructors_in_web-based_distance_courses","289944110_Improving_awareness_and_reflection_through_collaborative_interactive_visualizations_of_badges","223320807_Promoting_self-regulated_learning_in_web-based_learning_environments","223102015_The_learning_kit_project_Software_tools_for_supporting_and_researching_regulation_of_collaborative_learning","220956619_AAT_-_A_tool_for_accessing_and_analysing_students'_behaviour_data_in_learning_systems"]}
