{"id":"337460785_Estimating_Gaps_in_Martingales_and_Applications_to_Coin-Tossing_Constructions_and_Hardness","abstract":"Consider the representative task of designing a distributed coin-tossing protocol for n processors such that the probability of heads is \\(X_0\\in [0,1]\\). This protocol should be robust to an adversary who can reset one processor to change the distribution of the final outcome. For \\(X_0=1/2\\), in the information-theoretic setting, no adversary can deviate the probability of the outcome of the well-known Blum’s “majority protocol” by more than \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi n}}\\), i.e., it is \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi n}}\\) insecure.","authors":["Hamidreza Amini Khorasgani","Hemanta Maji","Tamalika Mukherjee"],"meta":["November 2019","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-36033-7_13","In book: Theory of Cryptography (pp.333-355)"],"references":["277292952_Martingales_collective_coin_flipping_and_discrete_control_processes_Extended_Abstract","266247920_Can_Optimally-Fair_Coin_Tossing_Be_Based_on_One-Way_Functions","225198696_On_the_Black-Box_Complexity_of_Optimally-Fair_Coin_Tossing","225144239_1p-Secure_Multiparty_Computation_without_Honest_Majority_and_the_Best_of_Both_Worlds","221498679_On_the_Impossibility_of_Cryptography_with_Imperfect_Randomness","221354874_Protocols_for_Multiparty_Coin_Toss_With_Dishonest_Majority","221354105_Separating_Sources_for_Encryption_and_Secret_Sharing","221354017_Does_Privacy_Require_True_Randomness","4004082_On_the_nonuniversality_of_the_one-time_pad","329392144_Tighter_Bounds_on_Multi-Party_Coin_Flipping_via_Augmented_Weak_Martingales_and_Differentially_Private_Sampling","312078355_Fair_Coin_Flipping_Tighter_Analysis_and_the_Many-Party_Case","309369692_Almost-Optimally_Fair_Multiparty_Coin-Tossing_with_Nearly_Three-Quarters_Malicious","301978906_Complete_Characterization_of_Fairness_in_Secure_Two-Party_Computation_of_Boolean_Functions","300334621_On_the_Classification_of_Finite_Boolean_Functions_up_to_Fairness","287034862_An_almost-optimally_fair_three-party_coin-flipping_protocol","273158190_Adaptively_Secure_Coin-Flipping_Revisited","267174622_Towards_Characterizing_Complete_Fairness_in_Secure_Two-Party_Computation","262393431_A_Full_Characterization_of_Functions_that_Imply_Fair_Coin_Tossing_and_Ramifications_to_Fairness","262220082_Limits_on_the_Usefulness_of_Random_Oracles","234786530_Limits_on_the_security_of_coin_flips_when_half_the_processors_are_faulty","228057769_Probability_Inequalities_for_Sums_of_Bounded_Random_Variables","227101997_Partial_Fairness_in_Secure_Two-Party_Computation","227074015_Simulating_BPP_Using_a_General_Weak_Random_Source","226124348_Some_extremal_problems_arising_from_discrete_control_processes","222482684_Extracting_Randomness_A_Survey_and_New_Constructions","221591241_How_to_Exchange_Secret_Keys_Extended_Abstract","220780160_Biased_Random_Walks_Lyapunov_Functions_and_Stochastic_Analysis_of_Best_Fit_Bin_Packing_Preliminary_Version","220337103_An_Optimally_Fair_Coin_Toss","220334511_Complete_Fairness_in_Secure_Two-Party_Computation","38370094_Weighted_sums_of_certain_dependent_variables","3880883_Extracting_randomness_from_samplable_distributions","3636069_Extracting_Randomness_How_and_Why_A_survey","3593103_Computing_with_Very_Weak_Random_Sources"]}
