In addition, six open-ended questions about the using of mind mapping in constructive science and technology education were asked to science teacher candidates (n = 25, male = 9; female = 16) and then, the data gained from this research was analyzed. In the result, according to science teacher candidates, mind mapping can be used in constructive science and technology effectively and help students in different stages; however, some science topics is not suitable for using mind mapping.","authors":["Ertug Evrekli","Ali günay balım","Didem Inel Ekici"],"meta":["December 2009Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences 1(1):2274-2279","DOI:10.1016/j.sbspro.2009.01.400"],"references":["242336149_Mind_mapping_in_executive_education_Applications_and_outcomes","242108066_The_use_of_a_constructivist_teaching_model_in_environmental_science_at_Beijing_Normal_University","228703184_Graphical_Knowledge_Display-Mind_Mapping_and_Concept_Mapping_as_Efficient_Tools_in_Mathematics_Education","34293359_The_effects_of_a_brain-based_learning_strategy_mind_mapping_on_achievement_of_adults_in_a_training_environment_with_consideration_to_learning_styles_and_brain_hemisphericity_microform","29835614_The_effectiveness_of_using_mind_mapping_skills_in_enhancing_secondary_one_and_secondary_four_students'_writing_in_a_CMI_school"]}
