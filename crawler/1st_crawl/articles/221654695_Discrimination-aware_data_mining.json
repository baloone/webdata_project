{"id":"221654695_Discrimination-aware_data_mining","abstract":"In the context of civil rights law, discrimination refers to unfair or unequal treatment of people based on member- ship to a category or a minority, without regard to individ- ual merit. Rules extracted from databases by data mining techniques, such as classification or association rules, when used for decision tasks such as benefit or credit approval, can be discriminatory in the above sense. In this paper, the notion of discriminatory classification rules is introduced and studied. Providing a guarantee of non-discrimination is shown to be a non trivial task. A na¨õve approach, like tak- ing away all discriminatory attributes, is shown to be not enough when other background knowledge is available. Our approach leads to a precise formulation of the redlining prob- lem along with a formal result relating discriminatory rules with apparently safe ones by means of background knowl- edge. An empirical assessment of the results on the German credit dataset is also provided.","authors":["Dino Pedreschi","Salvatore Ruggieri","Franco Turini"],"meta":["August 2008","DOI:10.1145/1401890.1401959","SourceDBLP","Conference: Proceedings of the 14th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, Las Vegas, Nevada, USA, August 24-27, 2008"],"references":["239696783_FIMI'03_Workshop_on_Frequent_Itemset_Mining_Implementations","308351893_CPAR_Classification_based_on_predictive_association_rules","277426265_The_Economics_of_Discrimination","269504053_Statistical_Methods_in_Discrimination_Litigation","262235629_Privacy-preserving_data_mining","260388905_Privacy_Preserving_Data_Mining","248192679_UCI_Repository_of_Machine_Learning_Databases","229896234_Statistical_Methods_in_Model_Discrimination","228179862_Discrimination_in_Mortgage_Lending_A_Critical_Review_of_the_Literature","227634404_Racial_Profiling_Insurance_Style_Insurance_Redlining_and_the_Uneven_Development_of_Metropolitan_Areas"]}
