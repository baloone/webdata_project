{"id":"292686460_E2ML_A_tool_for_sketching_instructional_designs","abstract":"This chapter introduces E2ML, the educational environment modeling language. E2ML is a lightweight visual language for instructional design; suitable both for complex instructional design processes and simple paper and pencil sketches. E2ML can be used for visualizing the intermediate and final results of design, thus providing documentation in a shared language that can enhance team communication, improve design and contribute to the development of high-quality instruction. The language and its features and applications are presented through a case study, evaluation results are briefly reported, and critical issues are discussed.","authors":["Luca Botturi"],"meta":["January 2007","DOI:10.4018/978-1-59904-729-4.ch007"],"references":["228656632_Essential_use_cases_for_pedagogical_patterns","33682262_Visual_Languages_for_Instructional_Design_an_Evaluation_of_E2ML","234621536_What_and_How_Do_Designers_Design_A_Theory_of_Design_Structure"]}
