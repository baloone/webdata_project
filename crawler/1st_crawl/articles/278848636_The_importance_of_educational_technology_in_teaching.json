{"id":"278848636_The_importance_of_educational_technology_in_teaching","abstract":"Today, more than ever, the role of educational technology in teaching is of great importance because of the use of information and communication technologies. With the help of various applications for distance education, the Internet, teachers, and students themselves, they see the advantage of educational technology.
