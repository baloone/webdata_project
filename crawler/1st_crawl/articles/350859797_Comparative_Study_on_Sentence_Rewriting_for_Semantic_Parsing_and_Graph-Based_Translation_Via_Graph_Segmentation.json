{"id":"350859797_Comparative_Study_on_Sentence_Rewriting_for_Semantic_Parsing_and_Graph-Based_Translation_Via_Graph_Segmentation","abstract":"Machine translation is universally discussed by people worldwide nowadays along with the developments of computer science and artificial intelligence, however, sentence parsing and the translation errors between original language to target language are still difficult problems during the translation. This essay illustrates the main points of the two articles both of which concentrate on the methods to enhance the precision rate and accuracy of semantic parsing and translation, and makes a comparison between them. Even though these articles can increase the accuracy of translation, some of the backwards still exist and they are proposed to make the articles improved with their objectivity and precision.","authors":["Ying Tian"],"meta":["April 2021Journal of Physics Conference Series 1852(4):042021","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/1852/4/042021"],"references":["311315523_More_Accurate_Question_Answering_on_Freebase","306093636_Graph-Based_Translation_Via_Graph_Segmentation","220816913_Statistical_Phrase-Based_Translation","329977953_Imitation_Learning_of_Agenda-based_Semantic_Parsers","306093523_Sentence_Rewriting_for_Semantic_Parsing","282162224_Semantic_parsing_on_freebase_from_question-answer_pairs","270878664_Semantic_Parsing_via_Paraphrasing","270878429_Information_Extraction_over_Structured_Data_Question_Answering_with_Freebase","270877688_Knowledge-Based_Question_Answering_as_Machine_Translation"]}
