{"id":"227859256_The_Game_of_Cops_and_Robbers_on_Graphs","abstract":"This book is the first and only one of its kind on the topic of Cops and Robbers games, and more generally, on the field of vertex pursuit games on graphs. The book is written in a lively and highly readable fashion, which should appeal to both senior undergraduates and experts in the field (and everyone in between). One of the main goals of the book is to bring together the key results in the field; as such, it presents structural, probabilistic, and algorithmic results on Cops and Robbers games. Several recent and new results are discussed, along with a comprehensive set of references. The book is suitable for self-study or as a textbook, owing in part to the over 200 exercises. The reader will gain insight into all the main directions of research in the field and will be exposed to a number of open problems.","authors":["Anthony Bonato","Richard Joseph Nowakowski"],"meta":["September 2011","DOI:10.1090/stml/061","Publisher: American Mathematical Society"],"references":["240828342_The_cop_density_of_a_graph"]}
