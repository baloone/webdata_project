{"id":"289218531_A_Graph_Data_Model_for_Attack_Graph_Generation_and_Analysis","abstract":"Attack graph is a useful tool for enumerating multi-stage, multi-host attacks in organizational networks. It helps in understanding the diverse nature of threats and to decide on countermeasures which require on-the-fly implementation of custom algorithms for attack graph analysis. Existing approaches on interactive analysis of attack graph use relational database which lack data structures and operations related to graph. Graph databases enable storage of graph data and efficient querying of such data. In this paper, we present a graph data model for representing input information for attack graph generation. Also, we show how graph queries can be used to generate attack graph and facilitate its analysis.","authors":["Mridul Barik","Chandan Mazumdar"],"meta":["March 2014Communications in Computer and Information Science 420:239-250","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-54525-2_22","Conference: International Conference on Security in Computer Networks and Distributed Systems"],"references":["262164617_Massive_scale_cyber_traffic_analysis_a_driver_for_graph_database_research","228361969_Validating_and_Restoring_Defense_in_Depth_Using_Attack_Graphs","226860954_Topological_Analysis_of_Network_Attack_Vulnerability","221609233_A_scalable_approach_to_attack_graph_generation","220996559_A_comparison_of_a_graph_database_and_a_relational_database_A_data_provenance_perspective","220065516_Implementing_interactive_analysis_of_attack_graphs_using_relational_databases","4238217_Toward_a_Query_Language_for_Network_Attack_Data","3948684_Automated_Generation_and_Analysis_of_Attack_Graphs","222827455_Minimum-cost_network_hardening_using_attack_graphs","221632125_An_Efficient_and_Unified_Approach_to_Correlating_Hypothesizing_and_Predicting_Intrusion_Alerts","221565992_A_Scalable_Approach_to_Full_Attack_Graphs_Generation","220068436_Extending_Attack_Graph-Based_Security_Metrics_and_Aggregating_Their_Application","3851975_Using_model_checking_to_analyze_network_vulnerabilities"]}
