{"id":"323207851_Predicting_reaction_performance_in_C-N_cross-coupling_using_machine_learning","abstract":"Machine learning methods are becoming integral to scientific inquiry in numerous disciplines. Here we demonstrate that machine learning can be used to predict the performance of a synthetic reaction in multidimensional chemical space using data obtained via high-throughput experimentation. We created scripts to compute and extract atomic, molecular, and vibrational descriptors for the components of a palladium-catalyzed Buchwald-Hartwig cross-coupling of aryl halides with 4-methylaniline in the presence of various potentially inhibitory additives. Using these descriptors as inputs and reaction yield as output, we show that a random forest algorithm provides significantly improved predictive performance over linear regression analysis. The random forest model was also successfully applied to sparse training sets and out-of-sample prediction, suggesting its value in facilitating adoption of synthetic methodology.","authors":["Derek T.
