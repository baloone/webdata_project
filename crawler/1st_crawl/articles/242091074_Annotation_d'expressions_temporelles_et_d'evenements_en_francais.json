{"id":"242091074_Annotation_d'expressions_temporelles_et_d'evenements_en_francais","abstract":"We propose a method to extract expressions of temporal location in French texts, and all verbs, nouns and adjectived that denote an event or a state. This method also com- putes some semantic information : the value of the temporal location according to the TimeML standard and the types of eventualities. For temporal locat ion expression, we use a cascade of transducers, wheras event identification is based on full sy ntactic parsing. Our result are com- pared to similar work on English, as no other empirical evaluation has been done on French before.
