{"id":"242913315_Heavy_Traffic_Asymptotics_for_a_Gated_Infinite-Server_Queue_with_Uniform_Service_Times","abstract":"The authors consider a gated, infinite-server queue with uniform service times. Using perturbation methods they construct asymptotic formulas for the probability that k customers are served during a stage. The authors assume that the Poisson arrival rate λ is large and consider the two space scales k = λ+O(√λ) and k = O(λ). This leads to very simple approximations to the probability distribution, which are shown to be in excellent agreement with numerical results.","authors":["Xiaoming Tan","Charles Knessl"],"meta":["December 1994SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics 54(6)","DOI:10.1137/S0036139993249676"],"references":["2352299_The_Gated_Infinite-Server_Queue_Uniform_Service_Times","220084909_A_Single_Server_Queue_with_Gated_Processor-Sharing_Discipline","220084526_Response_Times_in_Gated_MG1_Queues_The_Processor-Sharing_Case"]}
