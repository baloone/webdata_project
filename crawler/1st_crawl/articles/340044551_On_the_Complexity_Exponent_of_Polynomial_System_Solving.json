{"id":"340044551_On_the_Complexity_Exponent_of_Polynomial_System_Solving","abstract":"We present a probabilistic Las Vegas algorithm for solving sufficiently generic square polynomial systems over finite fields. We achieve a nearly quadratic running time in the number of solutions, for densely represented input polynomials. We also prove a nearly linear bit complexity bound for polynomial systems with rational coefficients. Our results are obtained using the combination of the Kronecker solver and a new improved algorithm for fast multivariate modular composition.","authors":["Joris van der Hoeven","Gr√©goire Lecerf"],"meta":["March 2020Foundations of Computational Mathematics 21(1)","DOI:10.1007/s10208-020-09453-0"],"references":["332581211_Fast_multivariate_multi-point_evaluation_revisited","331838243_Accelerated_tower_arithmetic","325041552_Modular_composition_via_factorization","311842590_On_the_bit_complexity_of_polynomial_system_solving","300576269_Fast_Matrix_Multiplication","346617235_Integer_multiplication_in_time_On_log_n","337608649_Fast_polynomial_factorization_and_modular_composition","332218286_Faster_polynomial_multiplication_over_finite_fields_using_cyclotomic_coefficient_rings","324456653_On_the_complexity_of_the_Lickteig-Roy_subresultant_algorithm","301898185_Fast_Computation_of_Isomorphisms_Between_Finite_Fields_Using_Elliptic_Curves"]}
