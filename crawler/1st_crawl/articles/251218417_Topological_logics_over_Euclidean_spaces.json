Topological logics with connectedness. A topological logic is a formal language whose vari- ables range over subsets of topological spaces, and whose non-logical primitives denote xed topo- logical properties and operations involving these subsets. For example, let the function symbols\\, ( and denote the operations of intersection, union and topological closure, respectively; let the constant 0 denote the empty set; let the unary predicate c denote the property of connectedness; and let the binary predicate denote the subset relation.
