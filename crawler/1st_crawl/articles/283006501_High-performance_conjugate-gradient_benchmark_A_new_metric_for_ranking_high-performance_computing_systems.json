{"id":"283006501_High-performance_conjugate-gradient_benchmark_A_new_metric_for_ranking_high-performance_computing_systems","abstract":"We describe a new high-performance conjugate-gradient (HPCG) benchmark. HPCG is composed of computations and data-access patterns commonly found in scientific applications. HPCG strives for a better correlation to existing codes from the computational science domain and to be representative of their performance. HPCG is meant to help drive the computer system design and implementation in directions that will better impact future performance improvement.","authors":["Jack Dongarra","Michael Allen Heroux","Piotr Luszczek"],"meta":["August 2015International Journal of High Performance Computing Applications 30(1)","DOI:10.1177/1094342015593158"],"references":["277285101_Finite-choice_algorithm_optimization_in_Conjugate_Gradients_LAPACK_Working_Note_159","275831207_Preparing_for_Exascale_ORNL_Leadership_Computing_Facility_Application_Requirements_and_Strategy","260708633_Efficient_Sparse_Matrix-vector_Multiplication_on_x86-based_Many-core_Processors","241230261_Design_and_Implementation_of_the_HPC_Challenge_Benchmark_Suite","303673391_NAS_Parallel_Benchmarks","289554343_A_new_metric_for_ranking_high_performance_computing_systems","255907278_Hiding_global_synchronization_latency_in_the_preconditioned_Conjugate_Gradient_algorithm","255220223_PREPARING_FOR_EXASCALE_ORNL_Leadership_Computing_Application_Requirements_and_Strategy","255219213_Improving_performance_via_mini-applications","250765635_Iterative_Methods_for_Sparse_Linear_System"]}
