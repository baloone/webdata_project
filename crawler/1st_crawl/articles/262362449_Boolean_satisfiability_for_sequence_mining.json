{"id":"262362449_Boolean_satisfiability_for_sequence_mining","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a SAT-based encoding for the problem of discovering frequent, closed and maximal patterns in a sequence of items and a sequence of itemsets. Our encoding can be seen as an improvement of the approach proposed in [8] for the sequences of items. In this case, we show experimentally on real world data that our encoding is significantly better. Then we introduce a new extension of the problem to enumerate patterns in a sequence of itemsets. Thanks to the flexibility and to the declarative aspects of our SAT-based approach, an encoding for the sequences of itemsets is obtained by a very slight modification of that for the sequences of items.","authors":["Said Jabbour","Lakhdar Sais","Yakoub Salhi"],"meta":["October 2013","DOI:10.1145/2505515.2505577","Conference: Proceedings of the 22nd ACM international conference on Conference on information & knowledge management"],"references":["228525480_Cardinality_Networks_A_theoretical_and_empirical_study","227314286_clasp_A_Conflict-Driven_Answer_Set_Solver","221633097_Efficient_CNF_Encoding_of_Boolean_Cardinality_Constraints","220884370_Memory_Efficient_All-Solutions_SAT_Solver_and_Its_Application_for_Reachability_Analysis","220163339_A_Translation_of_Pseudo_Boolean_Constraints_to_SAT","6751759_Bases_of_Motifs_for_Generating_Repeated_Patterns_with_Wild_Cards","316163922_Conflict-driven_answer_set_solving","314522340_Enhancing_Pigeon-Hole_based_Encoding_of_Boolean_Cardinality_Constraints","313562744_Efficient_conflict_driven_learning_in_a_boolean_satisfiability_solver","275947073_A_SAT-Based_Approach_for_Discovering_Frequent_Closed_and_Maximal_Patterns_in_a_Sequence","257492692_Learning_from_Conflicts_in_Propositional_Satisfiability","242563585_On_the_Complexity_of_Derivation_in_Propositional_Calculus","225208045_An_efficient_polynomial_space_and_polynomial_delay_algorithm_for_enumeration_of_maximal_motifs_in_a_sequence","222252342_A_linear-time_transformation_of_linear_inequalities_into_conjunctive_normal_form","221653501_Constraint_programming_for_itemset_mining","221632878_Towards_an_Optimal_CNF_Encoding_of_Boolean_Cardinality_Constraints","221589058_ASIG_An_all-solution_SAT_solver_for_CNF_formulas","221313872_An_Output-Sensitive_Flexible_Pattern_Discovery_Algorithm","220779940_Pattern_discovery_on_character_sets_and_real-valued_data_Linear_bound_on_irredundant_motifs_and_an_efficient_polynomial_time_algorithm","220765445_A_Constraint_Programming_Approach_for_Enumerating_Motifs_in_a_Sequence","220546837_Itemset_mining_A_constraint_programming_perspective","213887971_A_Machine_Program_for_Theorem_Proving","4324133_Prism_A_Primal-Encoding_Approach_for_Frequent_Sequence_Mining","3927197_Efficient_Conflict_Driven_Learning_in_a_Boolean_Satisfiability_Solver","3674796_GRASP-A_new_search_algorithm_for_satisfiability","3597732_Mining_Sequential_Patterns","2592178_Mining_Sequential_Patterns","2251196_GRASP---A_New_Search_Algorithm_for_Satisfiability"]}
