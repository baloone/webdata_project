{"id":"312529912_Generic_and_Effective_Specification_of_Structural_Test_Objectives","abstract":"A large amount of research has been carried out to automate white-box testing. While a wide range of different and sometimes heterogeneous code-coverage criteria have been proposed, there exists no generic formalism to describe them all, and available test automation tools usually support only a small subset of them. We introduce a new specification language, called HTOL (Hyperlabel Test Objectives Language), providing a powerful generic mechanism to define a wide range of test objectives. HTOL comes with a formal semantics, and can encode all standard criteria but full mutations. Besides specification, HTOL is appealing in the context of test automation as it allows to handle criteria in a unified way.","authors":["Michaël Marcozzi","Mickaël Delahaye","Sébastien Bardin","Nikolai Kosmatov"],"meta":["March 2017","DOI:10.1109/ICST.2017.48","Conference: 10th IEEE International Conference on Software Testing, Verification and Validation (ICST 2017)At: Tokyo, Japan","Project: Ltest: a Criterion-Independant White-Box Testing Toolbox"],"references":["307635998_Generic_and_Effective_Specification_of_Structural_Test_Objectives","282378950_Sound_and_Quasi-Complete_Detection_of_Infeasible_Test_Requirements","269305034_Efficient_Leveraging_of_Symbolic_Execution_to_Advanced_Coverage_Criteria","268212797_An_All-in-One_Toolkit_for_Automated_White-Box_Testing","259803945_Temporal_Logics_for_Hyperproperties","224185124_Guided_test_generation_for_coverage_criteria","312530127_Taming_Coverage_Criteria_Heterogeneity_with_LTest","279554751_Hyperproperties","265668053_The_Art_of_Software_Testing","240486276_Software_unit_test_coverage_and_adequacy"]}
