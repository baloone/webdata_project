{"id":"342237810_A_new_image_encryption_scheme_based_on_coupling_map_lattices_with_mixed_multi-chaos","abstract":"As a kind of spatiotemporal chaos, coupled map lattice (CML) is widely applied into image encryption because of its advantages of more complex dynamical behavior and lower computational overhead. Firstly, this paper proposed a novel spatiotemporal chaos model (MCML) by mixing Logistic, Sine and Tent maps into CML map together. Beyond that, we also change the structure of CML and the coupling method in different lattices. Bifurcation diagram, Lyapunov exponents and NIST test are employed to measure the chaotic behaviors of the MCML system. Secondly, by applying MCML chaos, we design a new key binding and distribution rule, the improved diffusion scheme to encrypt image. Furthermore, the novel bit Z-scan scrambling method also be used to enhance the security of the encryption scheme. Finally, a large number of experimental results prove that our proposed scheme is suitable for image encryption and has high security against common attacks.","authors":["Xingyuan Wang","Nana Guan","Hongyu Zhao","Siwei Wang"],"meta":["June 2020Scientific Reports 10(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-020-66486-9"],"references":["327125604_Sparsity-Based_Image_Inpainting_Detection_via_Canonical_Correlation_Analysis_With_Low-Rank_Constraints","336958715_High-sensitivity_image_encryption_algorithm_with_random_diffusion_based_on_dynamic-coupled_map_lattices","335212164_Image_encryption_algorithm_for_synchronously_updating_Boolean_networks_based_on_matrix_semi-tensor_product_theory","334140258_A_new_image_encryption_algorithm_with_nonlinear-diffusion_based_on_Multiple_coupled_map_lattices","331282715_Fast_Image_Encryption_Algorithm_Based_on_Parallel_Computing_System","327038824_Ternary_radial_harmonic_Fourier_moments_based_robust_stereo_image_zero-watermarking_algorithm","321982899_Low-Rank_Multi-View_Embedding_Learning_for_Micro-Video_Popularity_Prediction","305824966_Application_of_coupled_map_lattice_with_parameter_q_in_image_encryption","301302789_A_novel_image_encryption_scheme_based_on_substitution-permutation_network_and_chaos","301273723_A_fast_image_encryption_algorithm_based_on_chaotic_map"]}
