{"id":"270607045_What_makes_a_good_programmer","abstract":"The relationship between cognitive ability, personality, one's ability to successfully complete computer-programming tasks and individual personal attributes for a good programmer, was investigated. The specific individual value as an antecedent to both cognition and personality using object-oriented computer programming languages was examined to determine importance of an individual's theoretical value belief to programming performance predictors. It was observed that theoretical value belief is a set of personal standards that directs an individual to rational judgments in the psychoanalytic sense for analysis of problems. analysis of four components of personality such as self-esteem, generalized self-efficiency, locus of control, and neuroticism during the study on undergraduate students showed that these personality traits can be used to calculate aggregate that can be used as an indicator to good programmer.","authors":["Casey Cegielski","Dianne J Hall"],"meta":["October 2006Communications of the ACM 49(10):73-75","DOI:10.1145/1164394.1164397"],"references":["272790646_The_Theory_of_Planned_Behavior","239646464_The_problem_of_teaching_object-oriented_programming","220426367_Learning_to_Program_and_Learning_to_Think_What's_the_Connection","220420127_What_Best_Predicts_Computer_Proficiency","13738146_Dispositional_Effects_on_Job_and_Life_Satisfaction_The_Role_of_Core_Evaluations"]}
