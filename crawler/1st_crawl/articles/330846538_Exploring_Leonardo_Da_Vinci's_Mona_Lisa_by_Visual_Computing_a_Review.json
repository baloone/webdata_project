{"id":"330846538_Exploring_Leonardo_Da_Vinci's_Mona_Lisa_by_Visual_Computing_a_Review","abstract":"This paper surveys on relevant aspects of Leonardo Da Vinci's Mona Lisa, one of the most important pieces of art worldwide, from a visual computing perspective. This is accomplished by describing state-of-the-art works in the areas of image analysis and human computer interaction advancing hypotheses about the identity, ambiguity and hidden features of Mona Lisa's portrait. The second part of the paper is dedicated to describing computer graphics models in 2D and 3D for capturing the visual details of the portrait, in order to discover new features and advancing new hypotheses about the painting. Finally, the different works are discussed and a suggestion for future work is proposed. This paper can be particularly useful to computer vision, applied mathematics\nand statistics as well as art and history research communities, in order to understand the current literature methods, their limitations, and explore new directions for shedding light on a mystery still partially unsolved in the art history.","authors":["Alessia Amelio"],"meta":["January 2019","Conference: Visual Pattern Extraction and Recognition for Cultural Heritage Understanding (VIPERC2019)At: Pisa, ItalyVolume: http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2320/"],"references":[]}
