{"id":"269711307_Games_for_Active_XML_Revisited","abstract":"The paper studies the rewriting mechanisms for intensional documents in the\nActive XML framework, abstracted in the form of active context-free games. The\nsafe rewriting problem studied in this paper is to decide whether the first\nplayer, Juliet, has a winning strategy for a given game and (nested) word; this\ncorresponds to a successful rewriting strategy for a given intensional\ndocument. The paper examines several extensions to active context-free games.\nThe primary extension allows more expressive schemas (namely XML schemas and\nregular nested word languages) for both target and replacement languages and\nhas the effect that games are played on nested words instead of (flat) words as\nin previous studies. Other extensions consider validation of input parameters\nof web services, and an alternative semantics based on insertion of service\ncall results.\nIn general, the complexity of the safe rewriting problem is highly\nintractable (doubly exponential time), but the paper identifies interesting\ntractable cases.","authors":["Martin Schuster","Thomas Schwentick"],"meta":["July 2017Theory of Computing Systems 61(1)","DOI:10.1007/s00224-016-9682-4","SourcearXiv"],"references":["234790000_Expressiveness_and_complexity_of_XML_Schema","227337339_Active_Context-Free_Games","225948750_Synthesis_for_Structure_Rewriting_Systems","225542838_Active_Context-Free_Games","225223543_The_Active_XML_project_an_overview","321610844_Automata_Logics_and_Infinite_Games_A_Guide_to_Current_Research","234805553_The_monotone_and_planar_circuit_value_problems_are_log_space_complete_for_P","233917712_On_optimum_left-to-right_strategies_for_active_context-free_games","225648518_Adding_Nesting_Structure_to_Words","222961722_Complete_problems_for_deterministic_polynomial_time","221559836_Regular_rewriting_of_active_XML_and_unambiguity","221213959_Exchanging_Intensional_XML_Data","222637351_Domino-tiling_games","221403587_Pushdown_Processes_Games_and_Model_Checking","221220606_Rewrite_Games"]}
