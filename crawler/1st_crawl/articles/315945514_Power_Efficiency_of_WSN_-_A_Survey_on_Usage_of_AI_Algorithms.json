{"id":"315945514_Power_Efficiency_of_WSN_-_A_Survey_on_Usage_of_AI_Algorithms","abstract":"Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN)s and Artificial Intelligence are the important emerging technologies of computer science. Wireless Sensor Networks keeps track of the dynamic environment that changes rapidly and artificial intelligence is making the machines intelligence. The wireless sensor networks are consisting of several sensor nodes which are designed with the little memory, smaller power and less strength of communication among neighbor nodes. The dynamic behavior of an environment is due to the external conditions or WSN system designers. To adjust to these varying conditions, sensor networks are implemented based on the artificial intelligence techniques. Artificial intelligence also incorporates the utilization of the available resources to the extent by minimizing the energy consumption of sensor nodes. In the present paper, it is involved with the address of common problems associated with the sensor nodes and how it is incorporated by applying Artificial Intelligence.","authors":["Renuka Rajesh Patil","Suresha"],"meta":["February 2017Indian Journal of Science and Technology 10(6):1-4","DOI:10.17485/ijst/2017/v10i6/109419"],"references":["268926422_Localization_Estimation_Using_Artificial_Intelligence_Technique_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","265348518_Power_Management_in_Wireless_Networks","258392622_Intrusion_Detection_Systems_Based_on_Artificial_Intelligence_Techniques_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","222652984_Energy_Conservation_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_A_Survey","297332942_Using_predictable_observer_mobility_for_power_efficient_design_of_sensor_networks","288244743_A_novel_clustering_approach_Artificial_bee_colony_ABC_algorithm","286385414_Artificial_bee_colony_algorithm_for_dynamic_deployment_of_wireless_sensor_networks","285651660_Multi-agent_pathfinding_with_simultaneous_execution_of_single-agent_primitives","255638348_An_Idea_Based_on_Honey_Bee_Swarm_for_Numerical_Optimization_Technical_Report_-_TR06","233993753_Infrastructure_for_Testing_Nodes_of_a_Wireless_Sensor_Network"]}
