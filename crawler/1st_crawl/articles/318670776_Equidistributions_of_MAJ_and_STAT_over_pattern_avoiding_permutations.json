{"id":"318670776_Equidistributions_of_MAJ_and_STAT_over_pattern_avoiding_permutations","abstract":"Babson and Steingr\\'{\\i}msson introduced generalized permutation patterns and showed that most of the Mahonian statistics in the literature can be expressed by the combination of generalized pattern functions. Particularly, they defined a new Mahonian statistic in terms of generalized pattern functions, which is denoted $stat$. Recently, Amini investigated the equidistributions of these Mahonian statistics over sets of pattern avoiding permutations. Moreover, he posed several conjectures. In this paper, we construct a bijection from $S_n(213)$ to $S_n(231)$, which maps the statistic $(maj,stat)$ to the statistic $(stat,maj)$. This allows us to give solutions to some of Amini's conjectures.","authors":["Joanna Na Chen"],"meta":["July 2017"],"references":["281299448_On_joint_distribution_of_adjacencies_descents_and_some_Mahonian_statistics","324461946_A_Combinatorial_Property_of_q_-Eulerian_Numbers","316986935_A_New_Bijective_Proof_of_Babson_and_Steingrimsson's_Conjecture","316955496_Equidistributions_of_Mahonian_Statistics_over_Pattern_Avoiding_Permutations","248620186_A_Combinatorial_Property_of_q-Eulerian_Numbers","229267292_Babson-Steingrimsson_Statistics_are_Indeed_Mahonian_and_Sometimes_Even_Euler-Mahonian","221710904_Lehmer_code_transforms_and_Mahonian_statistics_on_permutations","220295934_Two_oiseau_decompositions_of_permutations_and_their_application_to_Eulerian_calculus","51939837_Permutation_patterns_and_statistics","2633668_Generalized_permutation_patterns_and_a_classification_of_the_Mahonian_statistics"]}
