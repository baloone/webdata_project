{"id":"343265389_Fault_Tolerant_Approximate_BFS_Structures_with_Additive_Stretch","abstract":"This paper addresses the problem of designing a \\(\\beta \\)-additive fault-tolerant approximate BFS (or FT-ABFS for short) structure, namely, a subgraph H of the network G such that subsequent to the failure of a single edge e, the surviving part of H still contains an approximate BFS spanning tree for (the surviving part of) G, whose distances satisfy \\(\\mathrm{dist}(s,v,H{\\setminus } \\{e\\}) \\le \\mathrm{dist}(s,v,G{\\setminus } \\{e\\})+\\beta \\) for every \\(v \\in V\\). It was shown in Parter and Peleg (SODA, 2014), that for every \\(\\beta \\in [1, O(\\log n)]\\) there exists an n-vertex graph G with a source s for which any \\(\\beta \\)-additive FT-ABFS structure rooted at s has \\(\\Omega (n^{1+\\epsilon (\\beta )})\\) edges, for some function \\(\\epsilon (\\beta ) \\in (0,1)\\). In particular, 3-additive FT-ABFS structures admit a lower bound of \\(\\Omega (n^{5/4})\\) edges. In this paper we present the first upper bound, showing that there exists a poly-time algorithm that for every n-vertex unweighted undirected graph G and source s constructs a 4-additive FT-ABFS structure rooted at s with at most \\(O(n^{4/3})\\) edges. The main technical contribution of our algorithm is in adapting the path-buying strategy used in Baswana et al. (ACM Trans Algorithms 7:A5, 2010) and Cygan et al. (Proceedings of the 30th symposium on theoretical aspects of computer science, pp 209â€“220, 2013) to failure-prone settings.","authors":["Merav Parter","David Peleg"],"meta":["December 2020Algorithmica 82(4)","DOI:10.1007/s00453-020-00734-2"],"references":["279632763_Improved_Purely_Additive_Fault-Tolerant_Spanners","264497911_Vertex_Fault_Tolerant_Additive_Spanners","263390493_Fault_Tolerant_Approximate_BFS_Structures","239321680_Approximate_Distance_Oracles_for_Unweighted_Graphs_in_Expected_On2_Time","322744213_f-sensitivity_distance_oracles_and_routing_schemes","322647928_Fault-Tolerant_Approximate_BFS_Structures","309580348_Sparse_Fault-Tolerant_BFS_Structures","286169692_New_Additive_Spanners","284684743_Extremal_problems_in_graph_theory","266961815_Fault_Tolerant_Additive_Spanners","235410068_Algebraic_Graph_Theory","234810199_Additive_spanners_and_a_b-spanners","234083260_On_Pairwise_Spanners","220994413_Approximate_Shortest_Paths_Avoiding_a_Failed_Vertex_Optimal_Size_Data_Structures_for_Unweighted_Graph","221498269_Distance_Oracles_beyond_the_Thorup--Zwick_Bound"]}
