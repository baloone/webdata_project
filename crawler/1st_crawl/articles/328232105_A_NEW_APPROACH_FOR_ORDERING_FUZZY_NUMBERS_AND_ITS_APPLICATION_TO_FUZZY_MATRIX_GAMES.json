{"id":"328232105_A_NEW_APPROACH_FOR_ORDERING_FUZZY_NUMBERS_AND_ITS_APPLICATION_TO_FUZZY_MATRIX_GAMES","abstract":"In this paper, a new geometric method for ordering generalized trapezoidal fuzzy numbers with different left and right heights, based on the Gergonne point of a triangle is presented. The suggested method can order not only generalized trapezoidal fuzzy numbers but also crisp numbers and generalized triangular fuzzy numbers with the same centroid point. We also give an application of the proposed ordering method to the fuzzy matrix games, whose payoffs are represented by generalized trapezoidal fuzzy numbers with different left and right heights.","authors":["Handan Akyar"],"meta":["January 2018"],"references":["313511416_Fuzzy_decision_analysis_on_the_development_of_centralized_regional_energy_control_systems","278694321_Fuzzy_Sets_and_Systems","268936368_The_modern_geometry_of_the_triangle","265772480_Mathematics_of_Fuzzy_Sets_and_Fuzzy_Logic","248150526_Transformation_Geometry_An_Introduction_to_Symmetry","220176167_Studying_interval_valued_matrix_games_with_fuzzy_logic"]}
