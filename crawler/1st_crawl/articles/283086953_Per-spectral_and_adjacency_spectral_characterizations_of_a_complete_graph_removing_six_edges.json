They claimed: for any and every large enough one can obtain graphs which are not DAS by removing edges from a complete graph . Let denote the set of all graphs obtained from a complete graph by deleting six edges. In this paper, we show that all graphs in are uniquely determined by their permanental spectra. However, we show that for each or there is just one pair of nonisomorphic cospectral graphs in , and for or 6 all graphs in are DAS.","authors":["Tingzeng Wu"],"meta":["October 2015Discrete Applied Mathematics 203","DOI:10.1016/j.dam.2015.09.014"],"references":["279916369_Computing_the_Permanental_Polynomial_of_the_High_Level_Fullerene_C_70_with_High_Precision","267696172_Per-spectral_characterizations_of_some_edge-deleted_subgraphs_of_a_complete_graph","285737362_Chemical_graph_theory_III_On_the_permanental_polynomial","279737513_Per-spectral_characterizations_of_graphs_with_extremal_per-nullity","268972983_On_spectrum_and_per-spectrum_of_graphs","268552948_Relations_between_the_permanental_and_characteristic_polynomials_of_fullerenes_and_benzenoid_hydrocarbons","267189752_Computing_the_permanental_polynomial_of_C_60_in_parallel","266584341_Remarks_on_the_Relations_Between_the_Permanental_and_Characteristic_Polynomials_of_Fullerenes","266012860_A_note_on_the_relations_between_the_permanental_and_characteristic_polynomials_of_coronoid_hydrocarbons","263779305_Chemical_Graph_Theory","256584487_Computing_the_Permanental_Polynomial_of_a_Matrix_from_a_Combinatorial_Viewpoint","256091457_Permanental_Polynomials_of_the_Larger_Fullerenes","263688077_Characterizing_properties_of_permanental_polynomials_of_lollipop_graphs","256805724_The_spectral_characterization_of_-graphs","256805376_On_the_characterizing_properties_of_the_permanental_polynomials_of_graphs"]}
