{"id":"309622733_Is_Python_an_Appropriate_Programming_Language_for_Teaching_Programming_in_Secondary_Schools","abstract":"A variety of programming languages are used to teach fundamentals of programming in secondary schools in Slovakia. Nowadays, we observe a new trend, the Python language gaining ground. In our paper we evaluate the interviews, in which we asked teachers with years of pedagogical experience, what the reasons for selecting a particular programming language where. By analysing the responses we learn about their experience with teaching programming and create a list of the important elements in the selection of the most suitable programming language for secondary school students. We will seek an answer for the question whether the Python programming language is appropriate for all secondary school students.","authors":["Eva Klimekov√°"],"meta":["May 2015International Journal of Information and Communication Technologies in Education 4(2)","DOI:10.1515/ijicte-2015-0005"],"references":["271425337_C_or_Python_Which_One_to_Begin_with_A_Learner's_Perspective","221412812_Introductory_programming_languages_in_higher_education","31596786_Why_Complicate_Things_Introducing_Programming_in_High_School_Using_Python","290613886_PROPAEDEUTIC_OF_PROGRAMMING_AND_NEW_SCHOOL_REFORM","264945378_Introduction_to_computation_and_programming_using_Python_Revised_and_expanded_edition","47128099_Python_3_vyukovy_kurz"]}
