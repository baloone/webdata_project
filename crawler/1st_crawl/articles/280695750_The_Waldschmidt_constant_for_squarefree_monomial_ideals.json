{"id":"280695750_The_Waldschmidt_constant_for_squarefree_monomial_ideals","abstract":"Given a squarefree monomial ideal $I \\subseteq R =k[x_1,\\ldots,x_n]$, we show\nthat $\\widehat\\alpha(I)$, the Waldschmidt constant of $I$, can be expressed as\nthe optimal solution to a linear program constructed from the primary\ndecomposition of $I$. By applying results from fractional graph theory, we can\nthen express $\\widehat\\alpha(I)$ in terms of the fractional chromatic number of\na hypergraph also constructed from the primary decomposition of $I$. Moreover,\nexpressing $\\widehat\\alpha(I)$ as the solution to a linear program enables us\nto prove a Chudnovsky-like lower bound on $\\widehat\\alpha(I)$, thus verifying a\nconjecture of Cooper-Embree-H\\`a-Hoefel for monomial ideals in the squarefree\ncase. As an application, we compute the Waldschmidt constant and the resurgence\nfor some families of squarefree monomial ideals. For example, we determine both\nconstants for unions of general linear subspaces of $\\mathbb{P}^n$ with few\ncomponents compared to $n$, and we find the Waldschmidt constant for the\nStanley-Reisner ideal of a uniform matroid.","authors":["Cristiano Bocci","Susan Cooper","Elena Guardo","Brian Harbourne"],"meta":["December 2016Journal of Algebraic Combinatorics 44(4)","DOI:10.1007/s10801-016-0693-7","SourcearXiv"],"references":["279632705_Matroid_configurations_and_symbolic_powers_of_their_ideals","321621726_Positivity_in_Algebraic_Geometry_II_Positivity_for_Vector_Bundles_and_Multiplier_Ideals","278725462_Inductively_computable_unions_of_fat_linear_subspaces","275054759_Waldschmidt_constants_for_Stanley-Reisner_ideals_of_a_class_of_Simplicial_Complexes","267465839_Fractional_Graph_Theory_--_A_Rational_Approach","266512605_Singular_points_on_complex_hypersurfaces_and_multidimensional_Schwarz_lemma","266458350_Fractional_Graph_Theory_A_Rational_Approach_to_the_Theory_of_Graphs","265263378_A_Beginner's_Guide_to_Edge_and_Cover_Ideals","264673678_On_the_containment_hierarchy_for_simplicial_ideals","261761442_Resurgences_for_ideals_of_special_point_configurations_in_PN_coming_from_hyperplane_arrangements"]}
