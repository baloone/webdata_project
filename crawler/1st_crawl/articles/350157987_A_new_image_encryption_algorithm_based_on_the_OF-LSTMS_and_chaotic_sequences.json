{"id":"350157987_A_new_image_encryption_algorithm_based_on_the_OF-LSTMS_and_chaotic_sequences","abstract":"In this paper, a novel image encryption algorithm based on the Once Forward Long Short Term Memory Structure (OF-LSTMS) and the Two-Dimensional Coupled Map Lattice (2DCML) fractional-order chaotic system is proposed. The original image is divided into several image blocks, each of which is input into the OF-LSTMS as a pixel sub-sequence. According to the chaotic sequences generated by the 2DCML fractional-order chaotic system, the parameters of the input gate, output gate and memory unit of the OF-LSTMS are initialized, and the pixel positions are changed at the same time of changing the pixel values, achieving the synchronization of permutation and diffusion operations, which greatly improves the efficiency of image encryption and reduces the time consumption. In addition the 2DCML fractional-order chaotic system has better chaotic ergodicity and the values of chaotic sequences are larger than the traditional chaotic system. Therefore, it is very suitable to image encryption. Many simulation results show that the proposed scheme has higher security and efficiency comparing with previous schemes.","authors":["Yi He","Ying-Qian Zhang","Xin He","Xing-Yuan Wang"],"meta":["March 2021Scientific Reports 11(1):6398","DOI:10.1038/s41598-021-85377-1"],"references":["344640606_An_ILM-cosine_transform-based_improved_approach_to_image_encryption","342237810_A_new_image_encryption_scheme_based_on_coupling_map_lattices_with_mixed_multi-chaos","339940642_Fast_image_encryption_algorithm_based_on_parallel_permutation-and-diffusion_strategy","339832203_An_Efficient_Image_Encryption_Scheme_Based_on_S-Boxes_and_Fractional-Order_Differential_Logistic_Map","339075537_Quantum-inspired_cascaded_discrete-time_quantum_walks_with_induced_chaotic_dynamics_and_cryptographic_applications","338499733_A_secure_image_encryption_scheme_based_on_a_novel_2D_sine-cosine_cross-chaotic_SC3_map","341082057_A_new_color_image_encryption_scheme_based_on_2DNLCML_system_and_genetic_operations","339935407_A_novel_conditional_Butterfly_Network_Topology_based_chaotic_image_encryption","339071598_A_novel_one-dimensional_sine_powered_chaotic_map_and_its_application_in_a_new_image_encryption_scheme","338459301_Design_and_implementation_of_a_simple_dynamical_4-D_chaotic_circuit_with_applications_in_image_encryption"]}
