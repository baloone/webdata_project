{"id":"261568303_A_pseudospectral_method_for_nonlinear_Duffing_equation_involving_both_integral_and_non-integral_forcing_terms","abstract":"The Legendre pseudospectral method is developed for the numerical solution of nonlinear Duffing equation involving both integral and non-integral forcing terms. By using differentiation matrix, the problem is reduced to the solution of a system of algebraic equations. The method is general, easy to implement, and yields very accurate results. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and the efficiency of the proposed computational procedure.
