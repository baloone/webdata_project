{"id":"317250897_Life_satisfaction_A_key_to_managing_internet_social_media_addiction","abstract":"Internet and social media addictions continue to grow as our dependence on technology increases. Estimates posit that over 210 million people worldwide suffer from this. Given its influence on users, reducing these addictions are of importance. Previous research demonstrates the importance of emotional states in affecting addiction behaviors. Through the Cognitive-Behavioral Model of Pathological Internet Usage, the role of life satisfaction in reducing both generalized Internet addiction and social media addiction is explored. Additionally, how happiness and stress affect these addictions through life satisfaction is examined. Results show that life satisfaction has significant effects on both generalized Internet addiction and the specific addiction to social media. For addicted individuals, there may be deep-rooted issues in their lives, lowering their satisfaction and driving their continued or increased addictions to Internet technologies.","authors":["Phil Longstreet","Stoney Brooks"],"meta":["May 2017Technology in Society 50","DOI:10.1016/j.techsoc.2017.05.003"],"references":["263104765_The_benefits_and_dangers_of_enjoyment_with_social_networking_websites","256927324_Problematic_Use_of_Social_Network_Sites_The_Interactive_Relationship_Between_Gratifications_Sought_and_Privacy_Concerns","236033273_PLS-sem_Indeed_a_silver_bullet","224818399_Personality_Strength_and_Social_Capital","220438224_The_Benefits_of_Facebook_Friends_Social_Capital_and_College_Students'_Use_of_Online_Social_Network_Sites","8381344_The_Psychometric_Properties_of_the_Internet_Addiction_Test","5804162_Optimism_Stress_Life_Satisfaction_and_Job_Burnout_in_Restaurant_Managers","312673071_PLS-SEM_indeed_a_silver_bullet","284493429_Caught_in_the_Net_How_to_Recognize_the_Signs_of_Internet_Addiction_and_a_Winning_Strategy_for_Recovery","280797525_The_relationship_between_depression_and_Internet_addiction","272159642_The_Satisfaction_With_Life_Scale","269414275_Internet_Addiction_Prevalence_and_Quality_of_Real_Life_A_Meta-Analysis_of_31_Nations_Across_Seven_World_Regions","233065494_Subjective_Well-Being_Is_Essential_to_Well-Being","232586848_College_life_on-line_Healthy_and_unhealthy_Internet_use","228003128_Internet_Paradox_Revisited","226645943_The_Relationship_Between_Hope_Eustress_Self-Efficacy_and_Life_Satisfaction_Among_Undergraduates","223337034_A_cognitive_-_behavioral_model_of_pathological_Internet_use_PIU","222570906_The_Oxford_Happiness_Questionnaire_A_compact_scale_for_the_measurement_of_psychological_well-being","220259921_How_Habit_Limits_the_Predictive_Power_of_Intention_The_Case_of_Information_Systems_Continuance","220208360_Predicting_the_Continued_Use_of_Internet-Based_Learning_Technologies_The_Role_of_Habit","51551487_Assessing_clinical_trials_of_Internet_addiction_treatment_A_systematic_review_and_CONSORT_evaluation","26855236_The_Theory_of_Planned_Behavior_Applied_to_Young_People's_Use_of_Social_Networking_Web_Sites","16528747_A_Global_Measure_of_Perceived_Stress","14163790_Neurobiological_constraints_of_behavioral_models_of_motivation","12006619_Perceived_Stress_and_Coping_Resource_Availability_as_Predictors_of_Life_Satisfaction_in_Young_Middle-Aged_and_Older_Adults","8891282_Internet_Addiction_in_Students_A_Cause_of_Concern","7930044_Ko_CH_Yen_JY_Chen_CC_Chen_SH_Yen_CF_Gender_differences_and_related_factors_affecting_online_gaming_addiction_among_Taiwanese_adolescents_J_Nerv_Ment_Dis_193_273-277"]}
