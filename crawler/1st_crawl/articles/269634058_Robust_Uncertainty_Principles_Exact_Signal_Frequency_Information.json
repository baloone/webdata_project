Consider a discrete-time signal f∈C<sup>N</sup> and a randomly chosen set of frequencies Ω. Is it possible to reconstruct f from the partial knowledge of its Fourier coefficients on the set Ω? A typical result of this paper is as follows. Suppose that f is a superposition of |T| spikes f(t)=σ<sub>τ∈T</sub>f(τ)δ(t-τ) obeying |T|≤C<sub>M</sub>·(log N)<sup>-1</sup> · |Ω| for some constant C<sub>M</sub>>0. We do not know the locations of the spikes nor their amplitudes. Then with probability at least 1-O(N<sup>-M</sup>), f can be reconstructed exactly as the solution to the ℓ<sub>1</sub> minimization problem. In short, exact recovery may be obtained by solving a convex optimization problem. We give numerical values for C<sub>M</sub> which depend on the desired probability of success. Our result may be interpreted as a novel kind of nonlinear sampling theorem. In effect, it says that any signal made out of |T| spikes may be recovered by convex programming from almost every set of frequencies of size O(|T|·logN). Moreover, this is nearly optimal in the sense that any method succeeding with probability 1-O(N<sup>-M</sup>) would in general require a number of frequency samples at least proportional to |T|·logN. The methodology extends to a variety of other situations and higher dimensions. For example, we show how one can reconstruct a piecewise constant (one- or two-dimensional) object from incomplete frequency samples - provided that the number of jumps (discontinuities) obeys the condition above - by minimizing other convex functionals such as the total variation of f.","authors":["Emmanuel J Candès","Justin Romberg","Terence Tao"],"meta":["March 2006IEEE Transactions on Information Theory 52(2):489-509","DOI:10.1109/TIT.2005.862083","SourcearXiv"],"references":["267120366_Signal_Recovery_and_the_Large_Sieve","238591008_Uncertainty_Principles_and_Signal_Recovery","222469583_Nonlinear_total_variation_based_noise_removal_algorithms","221590672_Near-optimal_sparse_Fourier_representations_via_sampling","7202352_Optimally_sparse_representation_in_general_nonorthogonal_dictionaries_via","3644623_Spectrum-blind_minimum-rate_sampling_and_reconstruction_ofmultiband_signals","3084926_Sparse_Representations_in_Unions_of_Bases","3084741_On_sparse_representation_in_pair_of_bases","3080794_A_generalized_uncertainty_principle_and_sparse_representation_in_pairs_of_bases","314149133_Near-optimal_sparse_fourier_representations_via_sampling","278433201_Atomic_Decomposition_by_Basis_Pursuit","268471568_Recovery_of_acoustic_impedance_from_reflection_seismograms","249864166_Reconstruction_of_a_sparse_spike_train_from_a_portion_of_its_spectrum_and_application_to_high-resolution_deconvolution","244425076_Eigenvalue_Distribution_of_Time_and_Frequency_Limiting","241552528_Recovery_of_the_acoustic_impedance_from_reflection_seismograms","239666589_Just_relax_Convex_programming_methods_for_subset_selection_and_sparse_approximation","239065171_Linear_Inversion_of_Band-Limited_Reflection_Seismograms","238872858_The_Eigenvalue_Behavior_of_Certain_Convolution_Equations","236736805_A_sharp_concentration_inequality_with_application","230873264_Numerical_Optimization_Second_Edition","225828022_Chebotarev_and_his_density_theorem","224181020_Spectrum-blind_minimum-rate_sampling_and_reconstruction_of_2-D_multiband_signals","224117536_A_multicoset_sampling_approach_to_the_missing_cone_problem_in_computer-aided_tomography","200524372_Prolate_Spheroidal_Wave_Functions_Fourier_Analysis_and_Uncertainty_-_II","200524231_Optimally_sparse_representation_in_general_nonorthogonal_dictionaries_via_L1_minimization","38364995_Monotone_Convergence_of_Binomial_Probabilities_and_a_Generalization_of_Ramanujan's_Equation","23695155_A_Sharp_Concentration_Inequality_With_Applications","3326468_A_fast_and_accurate_Fourier_algorithm_for_iterative_parallel-beam_tomography","3318328_Sampling_Signals_With_Finite_Rate_of_Innovation","3085174_Greed_is_Good_Algorithmic_Results_for_Sparse_Approximation","3085041_On_Sparse_Representations_in_Arbitrary_Redundant_Bases","3080545_Uncertainty_Principles_and_Ideal_Atomic_Decomposition","2805287_Atomic_Decomposition_by_Basis_Pursuit","2601240_Recovery_Of_Blocky_Images_From_Noisy_And_Blurred_Data","2334719_A_Sharp_Concentration_Inequality_With_Applications","2108381_An_uncertainty_principle_for_cyclic_groups_of_prime_order"]}
