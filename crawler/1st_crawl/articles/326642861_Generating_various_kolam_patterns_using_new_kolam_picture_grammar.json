{"id":"326642861_Generating_various_kolam_patterns_using_new_kolam_picture_grammar","abstract":"Kolam is an artistic creation. It is a ubiquitous art form predominant in South India, while also seen in a few places in northern India and South East Asia. Kolam holds a rich tradition of cultural and medicinal significance. Kolams are generated using kolam grammar. This paper consists of set of rules which is used for manipulating kolam patterns under defined rules using axiom. It is enclosed under defined alphabets used for creating kolam patterns. We can generate many kolams with n number of pullis (dots) with finite number of rules.","authors":["Ramya G","Anand Mahendran"],"meta":["January 2018International Journal of Internet Technology and Secured Transactions 8(2):209","DOI:10.1504/IJITST.2018.093384"],"references":["309767503_Survey_on_various_Classes_of_Picture_Languages","237442288_Fundamental_Study_on_Design_System_of_Kolam_Pattern","234116828_Sequential_Encoding_of_Tamil_Kolam_Patterns","222584378_Picture_languages_with_array_rewriting_rules","220600057_Some_results_on_picture_languages"]}
