{"id":"334766280_On-site_airflow_measurement_of_a_laboratory_fume_hood_using_customized_large-scale_image-based_velocimetry","abstract":"This study demonstrates the feasibility of conducting on-site large-scale image-based measurements for indoor airflows characterisation. To illustrate the potential of our method, we chose to study the suction flow generated by a laboratory fume hood in operating conditions. As a matter of fact, laboratory fume hoods are frequently subject to routine checks during which air speed measurements by hot-wire anemometry are performed. However, classical point-to-point hot-wire anemometry may be not sufficient to detect and locate potential leakages. To improve these controls, we developed and tested a new method based on particle image velocimetry principles, which is non-intrusive and authorizes a good spatio-temporal analysis. To face large-scale and on-site issues, we had to make some adaptations. For this reason, we used tracers like bubbles or smoke which have good scattering properties. We also developed our own low-cost light system. To compute velocities from image sequences, we developed an optical flow algorithm based on a large-scale flow model instead of using traditional correlation. The tested method gave good results with a good agreement with sparse hot-wire anemometry measurements but with a wider spatial distribution. In addition, the method provided turbulence intensity estimation and a good monitoring of dynamic flow features, which is important for the detection of leakages.","authors":["Romain Schuster","Dominique Heitz","Philippe Georgeault","Étienne Mémin"],"meta":["July 2019Indoor and Built Environment 29(6):1420326X1986592","DOI:10.1177/1420326X19865928","Project: Science and technology for novel localised cold and/or clean airflow"],"references":["326849110_Motion_Estimation_Under_Location_Uncertainty_Application_to_large-scale_characterization_of_a_mixing_layer","320973123_Motion_Estimation_under_Location_Uncertainty_for_Turbulent_Fluid_Flow","305735420_PIV_uncertainty_propagation","333448216_Particle_Image_Velocimetry_A_Practical_Guide","326953865_2D-PIV_measurement_of_range_hood-driven_flow_in_a_domestic_kitchen","323159290_Experimental_and_numerical_flow_analysis_and_design_optimization_of_a_fume_hood_using_the_CFD_method","320185997_CFD_study_on_gaseous_pollutant_transmission_characteristics_under_different_ventilation_strategies_in_a_typical_chemical_laboratory","313616418_Determining_optical_ow","297593678_Installation_of_a_Flow_Control_Device_in_an_Inclined_Air-Curtain_Fume_Hood_to_Control_Wake-Induced_Exposure","280778126_Particle-Imaging_Techniques_for_Experimental_Fluid_Mechanics","280739588_Global_airflow_field_distribution_in_a_cabin_mock-up_measured_via_large-scale_2D-PIV","272405475_On_the_use_of_helium-filled_soap_bubbles_for_large-scale_tomographic_PIV_in_wind_tunnel_experiments","236235224_Fluid_flow_dynamics_under_location_uncertainty","261731351_Particle_Image_Velocimetry","259892677_A_review_of_the_performance_of_different_ventilation_and_airflow_distribution_systems_in_buildings"]}
