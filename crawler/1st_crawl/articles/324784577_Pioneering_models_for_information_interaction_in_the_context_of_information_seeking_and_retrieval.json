{"id":"324784577_Pioneering_models_for_information_interaction_in_the_context_of_information_seeking_and_retrieval","abstract":"Purpose\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to clarify the conceptual issues of information behaviour research by reviewing the approaches to information interaction in the context of information seeking and retrieval (IS&R).\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\n\nThe study uses the conceptual analysis focussing on four pioneering models for interactive IS&R proposed by Belkin, Ingwersen and Ingwersen and Järvelin.\n\nFindings\n\nA main characteristic of models for information interaction is the tripartite setting identifying information resources accessible through information systems, intermediary/interface and user. Dialogue is a fundamental constituent of information interaction. Early models proposed by Belkin and Ingwersen focussed on the dialogue occurring in user-intermediary interaction, while more recent frameworks developed by Ingwersen and Järvelin devote more attention to dialogue constitutive of user-information system interaction.\n\nResearch limitations/implications\n\nAs the study focusses on four models developed within the period of 1984-2005, the findings cannot be generalised to depict the phenomena of information interaction as a whole. Further research is needed to model the specific features of information interaction occurring in the networked information environments in particular.\n\nOriginality/value\n\nThe study pioneers by providing an in-depth analysis of the ways in which pioneering researchers have conceptualised the phenomena of interaction in the context of IS&R. The findings contribute to the elaboration of the conceptual space of information behaviour research.","authors":["Reijo Savolainen"],"meta":["April 2018Journal of Documentation 74(1)","DOI:10.1108/JD-11-2017-0154"],"references":["262253994_Human-Computer_Interaction_View_on_Information_Retrieval_Evaluation","239054075_Modeling_interaction_in_information_retrieval_IR_A_review_and_proposal","235267550_Search_procedures_in_the_library_-_Analysed_from_the_cognitive_point_of_view","235266270_ASK_for_information_retrieval_Part_I_Background_and_theory","233487009_Cognitive_Perspectives_Of_Information_Retrieval_Interaction_Elements_of_A_Cognitive_IR_Theory","228784950_Models_in_Information_Behaviour_Research","45647634_Tales_from_the_Field_Search_Strategies_Applied_in_Web_Searching","325742007_Interactions_with_search_systems","314295987_The_Tetris_Model_of_Resolving_Information_Needs_within_the_Information_Seeking_Process","281872958_Human_Information_Interaction_An_Ecological_Approach_to_Information_Behavior","274264895_Applying_an_information-seeking_dialogue_model_in_an_interactive_information_retrieval_system","267640881_Concept_analysis_for_library_and_information_science_Exploring_usage","260146924_Modeling_Users'_Web_Search_Behavior_and_Their_Cognitive_Styles","259535632_Human-Computer_Interaction","247323163_Question-Negotiation_and_Information_Seeking_in_Libraries","246448969_In_Support_of_a_Function_Definition_of_Interaction","245683238_Cognitive_analysis_and_the_role_of_the_intermediary_in_information_retrieval","242572887_Cognitive_Models_and_Information_Transfer","242477965_Models_of_dialogue_for_information_retrieval","242350315_Factors_affecting_relevance_judgment_A_report_from_TREC_Legal_track","242347152_Interaction_in_information_retrieval","234774832_Design_of_a_Classification_Scheme_for_Fiction_Based_on_an_Analysis_of_Actual_User-Librarian_Communication_and_Use_of_the_Scheme_for_Control_of_Librarian's_Search_Strategies","228008773_Interactive_information_retrieval","227732515_Information_Search_Tactics","222528923_Human-information_interaction_research_and_development","222500956_Cases_Scripts_and_Information-Seeking_Strategies_On_the_Design_of_Interactive_Information_Retrieval_Systems","222482554_Where_Should_the_Person_Stop_and_the_Information_Search_Interface_Start","222406370_The_SST_method_A_tool_for_analysing_Web_information_search_processes","220696203_Interacting_with_Information","220435625_Information_interaction_Providing_a_framework_for_information_architecture","220435524_Conceptual_framework_for_task_in_information_studies","220435339_The_dynamics_of_interactive_information_retrieval_behavior_Part_I_An_activity_theory_perspective","220230257_Braque_Design_of_an_Interface_to_Support_User_Interaction_in_Information_Retrieval","7815006_A_evolutionary_concept_analysis_of_caring"]}
