{"id":"313639798_Collaborative_Engineering_of_Integrated_Chassis_Control_for_Ground_Vehicle","abstract":"The paper introduces an approach to development and testing of integrated active chassis systems for the ground vehicle through intersectoral and interdisciplinary collaboration. The approach is illustrated by example of design of integrated control for the decoupled brake system, the active tyre pressure management and the active suspension elements. The corresponding demonstrator of sport utility vehicle is introduced. Testing procedures for the demonstrator are presented including remotely connected experiments at different locations. The paper explains how the development and testing processes are realized by way of knowledge transfer and experience sharing between academic and industrial collaborators.","authors":["Valentin Ivanov","Klaus Augsburg","Dzmitry Savitski","Viktor Schreiber"],"meta":["February 2017","Conference: IEEE ICM - International Conference on MechatronicsAt: Gippsland, Australia","Project: EVE - INNOVATIVE ENGINEERING OF GROUND VEHICLES WITH INTEGRATED ACTIVE CHASSIS SYSTEMS "],"references":["283152816_STATE-OF-THE-ART_AND_FUTURE_DEVELOPMENTS_IN_INTEGRATED_CHASSIS_CONTROL_FOR_GROUND_VEHICLES","282900180_Educational_Frameworks_for_Vehicle_Mechatronics","258792936_A_Bottom-Up_Approach_to_Teaching_Robotics_and_Mechatronics_to_Mechanical_Engineers","216815442_Investigation_of_Brake_Control_Using_Test_Rig-in-the-Loop_Technique","288707835_Innovative_Graduate_Program_in_Mechatronics_Engineering_to_Meet_the_Needs_of_the_Automotive_Industry","261332259_Project_based_learning_using_natural_energy_powered_small_electric_vehicle_for_sustainable_technology_education"]}
