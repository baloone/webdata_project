{"id":"317932993_JSAT_Java_statistical_analysis_tool_a_library_for_machine_learning","abstract":"Java Statistical Analysis Tool (JSAT) is a Machine Learning library written in pure Java. It works to fill a void in the Java ecosystem for a general purpose library that is relatively high performance and exible, which is not adequately fulfilled by Weka (Hall et al., 2009) and Java-ML (Abeel et al., 2009). Almost all of the algorithms are independently implemented using an Object-Oriented framework.","authors":["Edward Raff"],"meta":["April 2017Journal of Machine Learning Research 18:1-5"],"references":[]}
