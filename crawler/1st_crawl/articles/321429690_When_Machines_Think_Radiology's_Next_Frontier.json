{"id":"321429690_When_Machines_Think_Radiology's_Next_Frontier","abstract":"Artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and deep learning are terms now seen frequently, all of which refer to computer algorithms that change as they are exposed to more data. Many of these algorithms are surprisingly good at recognizing objects in images. The combination of large amounts of machine-consumable digital data, increased and cheaper computing power, and increasingly sophisticated statistical models combine to enable machines to find patterns in data in ways that are not only cost-effective but also potentially beyond humans' abilities. Building an AI algorithm can be surprisingly easy. Understanding the associated data structures and statistics, on the other hand, is often difficult and obscure. Converting the algorithm into a sophisticated product that works consistently in broad, general clinical use is complex and incompletely understood. To show how these AI products reduce costs and improve outcomes will require clinical translation and industrial-grade integration into routine workflow. Radiology has the chance to leverage AI to become a center of intelligently aggregated, quantitative, diagnostic information. Centaur radiologists, formed as a synergy of human plus computer, will provide interpretations using data extracted from images by humans and image-analysis computer algorithms, as well as the electronic health record, genomics, and other disparate sources. These interpretations will form the foundation of precision health care, or care customized to an individual patient.
