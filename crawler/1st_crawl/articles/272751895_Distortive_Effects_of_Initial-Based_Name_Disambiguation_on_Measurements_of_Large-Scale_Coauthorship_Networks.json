{"id":"272751895_Distortive_Effects_of_Initial-Based_Name_Disambiguation_on_Measurements_of_Large-Scale_Coauthorship_Networks","abstract":"Scholars have often relied on name initials to resolve name ambiguities in\nlarge-scale coauthorship network research. This approach bears the risk of\nincorrectly merging or splitting author identities. The use of initial-based\ndisambiguation has been justified by the assumption that such errors would not\naffect research findings too much. This paper tests this assumption by\nanalyzing coauthorship networks from five academic fields - biology, computer\nscience, nanoscience, neuroscience, and physics - and an interdisciplinary\njournal, PNAS. Name instances in datasets of this study were disambiguated\nbased on heuristics gained from previous algorithmic disambiguation solutions.\nWe use disambiguated data as a proxy of ground-truth to test the performance of\nthree types of initial-based disambiguation. Our results show that\ninitial-based disambiguation can misrepresent statistical properties of\ncoauthorship networks: it deflates the number of unique authors, number of\ncomponent, average shortest paths, clustering coefficient, and assortativity,\nwhile it inflates average productivity, density, average coauthor number per\nauthor, and largest component size. Also, on average, more than half of top 10\nproductive or collaborative authors drop off the lists. Asian names were found\nto account for the majority of misidentification by initial-based\ndisambiguation due to their common surname and given name initials.","authors":["Jinseok Kim","Jana Diesner"],"meta":["February 2015Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology 67(6)","DOI:10.1002/asi.23489","SourcearXiv"],"references":["301233136_Diffusion_of_scientific_credits_and_the_ranking_of_scientists","269488584_The_Impact_of_Name_Ambiguity_on_Properties_of_Coauthorship_Networks","262346065_A_Brief_Survey_of_Automatic_Methods_for_Author_Name_Disambiguation","261838322_Career_on_the_Move_Geography_Stratification_and_Scientific_Impact","257692155_Time-aware_PageRank_for_bibliographic_networks","254077910_The_Structure_of_a_Social_Science_Collaboration_Network_Disciplinary_Cohesion_from_1963_to_1999","253336632_Has_Large-Scale_Named-Entity_Network_Analysis_Been_Resting_on_a_Flawed_Assumption","232056997_Author_name_disambiguation_What_difference_does_it_make_in_author-based_citation_analysis","227993367_Author_Name_Disambiguation","222427938_On_the_Robustness_of_Centrality_Measures_Under_Conditions_of_Imperfect_Data","221995787_The_Igraph_Software_Package_for_Complex_Network_Research","220924496_Using_web_information_for_author_name_disambiguation","220556829_Robustness_of_centrality_measures_under_uncertainty_Examining_the_role_of_network_topology","49697736_Quantitative_and_empirical_demonstration_of_the_Matthew_effect_in_a_study_of_career_longevity","41013985_Author_name_disambiguation_in_MEDLINE","24104454_Economics_An_Emerging_Small_World","4929653_Network_Structure_Self-Organization_and_the_Growth_of_International_Collaboration_in_Science_Research_Policy_3410_2005_1608-1618","312970191_Scientific_collaboration_networks","260282121_Modes_of_collaboration_in_modem_science_Beyond_power_laws_and_preferential_attachment","255954036_Coauthorship_and_citation_patterns_in_the_Physical_Review","255173299_Accuracy_of_simple_initials-based_methods_for_author_name_disambiguation","229009323_A_national_analysis_of_minorities_in_science_and_engineering_faculties_at_research_universities","228253542_Co-Authorship_in_Management_and_Organizational_Studies_An_Empirical_and_Network_Analysis","224092002_He_says_she_says_Pat_says_Tricia_says_How_much_reference_resolution_matters_for_entity_extraction_relation_extraction_and_social_network_analysis","222546212_Evolution_of_the_social_network_of_scientific_collaborations_Physica_A_Statistical_Mechanics_and_its_Applications_3113_590-614","222219241_Scientific_discovery_and_topological_transitions_in_collaboration_networks","221654368_Name-ethnicity_classification_from_open_sources","220538657_DBLP_-_Some_lessons_learned","220435195_Collaboration_in_Computer_Science_A_Network_Science_Approach","220435104_Evolution_of_research_activities_and_intellectual_influences_in_information_science_1996-2005_Introducing_author_bibliographic-coupling_analysis_Journal_of_the_American_Society_for_Information_Science","220434957_Counting_First_Last_or_All_Authors_in_Citation_Analysis_A_Comprehensive_Comparison_in_the_Highly_Collaborative_Stem_Cell_Research_Field","220434446_An_unsupervised_heuristic-based_hierarchical_method_for_name_disambiguation_in_bibliographic_citations","220433245_A_Method_for_Eliminating_Articles_by_Homonymous_Authors_From_the_Large_Number_of_Articles_Retrieved_by_Author_Search","220365109_An_analysis_of_the_connection_between_researchers'_productivity_and_their_co-authors'_past_attributions_including_the_importance_in_collaboration_networks","220230744_Visualizing_and_mapping_the_intellectual_structure_of_information_retrieval","12179403_The_structure_of_scientific_collaboration_networks","11024286_Assortative_Mixing_in_Networks","8914620_A_probabilistic_similarity_metric_for_Medline_records_A_model_for_author_name_disambiguation_Research_articles","8901684_Coauthorship_Networks_and_Patterns_of_Scientific_Collaboration","8687635_The_simultaneous_evolution_of_article_and_author_networks_in_PNAS","2930322_The_Link_Prediction_Problem_for_Social_Networks","2887625_A_Faster_Algorithm_for_Betweenness_Centrality"]}
