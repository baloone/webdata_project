{"id":"334719455_Precipitation_Nowcasting_with_Satellite_Imagery","abstract":"Precipitation nowcasting is a short-range forecast of rain/snow (up to 2 hours), often displayed on top of the geographical map by the weather service. Modern precipitation nowcasting algorithms rely on the extrapolation of observations by ground-based radars via optical flow techniques or neural network models. Dependent on these radars, typical nowcasting is limited to the regions around their locations. We have developed a method for precipitation nowcasting based on geostationary satellite imagery and incorporated the resulting data into the Yandex.Weather precipitation map (including an alerting service with push notifications for products in the Yandex ecosystem), thus expanding its coverage and paving the way to a truly global nowcasting service.","authors":["Vadim Lebedev","Vladimir Ivashkin","Irina Rudenko","Alexander Ganshin"],"meta":["July 2019","DOI:10.1145/3292500.3330762","Conference: the 25th ACM SIGKDD International Conference"],"references":["321374973_Road_Extraction_by_Deep_Residual_U-Net","318615305_Learning_Aerial_Image_Segmentation_From_Online_Maps","318399221_The_impact_of_radar_data_assimilation_on_atmosphere_state_analysis_in_the_Moscow_region","329750281_Stacked_U-Nets_with_Multi-output_for_Road_Extraction","323257005_Horovod_fast_and_easy_distributed_deep_learning_in_TensorFlow","322059843_DeepRoadMapper_Extracting_Road_Topology_from_Aerial_Images","320971443_Full-Resolution_Residual_Networks_for_Semantic_Segmentation_in_Street_Scenes","320968206_Pyramid_Scene_Parsing_Network","319770168_Fully_Convolutional_Networks_for_Semantic_Segmentation","319633097_Generalised_Dice_Overlap_as_a_Deep_Learning_Loss_Function_for_Highly_Unbalanced_Segmentations"]}
