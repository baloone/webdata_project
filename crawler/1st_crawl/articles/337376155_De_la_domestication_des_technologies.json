{"id":"337376155_De_la_domestication_des_technologies","abstract":"Domesticating technology\nHow is technology for health and autonomy appropriated, in particular when installed at the patient’s home ? According to the theoretical approach to home use presented herein, users must domesticate technology ; and this entails eventual modifications and an integration of it in everyday routines. This domestication reaches beyond the adoption or use of a technological device, whence the need to understand what the technology means to users and how it fits into their lives. This theoretical approach lets us see domestication as a process with four phases : appropriation, when the technological device is acquired by its future user ; objectification, when it finds its place in the home environment ; incorporation, when it is put to use ; and conversion, when the user is capable of telling about it.","authors":["Myriam Lewkowicz"],"meta":["January 2017Annales des Mines - Réalités industrielles Mai 2017(2):33","DOI:10.3917/rindu1.172.0033"],"references":[]}
