{"id":"313991204_Science_Mapping_A_Systematic_Review_of_the_Literature","abstract":"Purpose: We present a systematic review of the literature concerning major aspects of science mapping to serve two primary purposes: First, to demonstrate the use of a science mapping approach to perform the review so that researchers may apply the procedure to the review of a scientific domain of their own interest, and second, to identify major areas of research activities concerning science mapping, intellectual milestones in the development of key specialties, evolutionary stages of major specialties involved, and the dynamics of transitions from one specialty to another.\nhttp://www.jdis.org/10.1515/jdis-2017-0006","authors":["Chaomei Chen"],"meta":["February 2017Journal of Data and Information Science 2(2):1-40","DOI:10.1515/jdis-2017-0006"],"references":["296671688_Grand_Challenges_in_Measuring_and_Characterizing_Scholarly_Impact","288827150_How_are_they_different_A_quantitative_domain_comparison_of_information_visualization_and_data_visualization_2000-2014","285673526_A_Bibliometric_Analysis_of_20_Years_of_Research_on_Software_Product_Lines","344951188_Visualization_Analysis_and_Design","324937048_The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions","303802749_Indexing_by_Latent_Semantic_Analysis","302073755_Keynote_speaker_Visualization_analysis_and_design","287422776_Literature_dynamics_Studies_on_growth_diffusion_and_epidemics","281538925_Scholarly_Communication_and_Bibliometrics","280895340_Visualizing_a_discipline_An_author_co-citation_analysis_of_information_science_1972-1995","275335177_The_Leiden_Manifesto_for_research_metrics","271218294_A_Review_of_Theory_and_Practice_in_Scientometrics","279968736_A_review_of_the_literature_on_citation_impact_indicators","273312859_Global_ontology_research_progress_A_bibliometric_analysis","272102209_Citation_Indexes_for_Science_A_New_Dimension_in_Documentation_through_Association_of_Ideas"]}
