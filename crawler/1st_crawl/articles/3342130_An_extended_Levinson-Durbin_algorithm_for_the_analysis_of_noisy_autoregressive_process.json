{"id":"3342130_An_extended_Levinson-Durbin_algorithm_for_the_analysis_of_noisy_autoregressive_process","abstract":"An extended Levinson-Durbin algorithm is proposed to recursively calculate the linear prediction coefficients and their derivatives with respect to the noise power for a noisy auto regressive process. This algorithm would be useful in some applications or analysis related to an autoregressive (AR) process that is contaminated by additive white noise.","authors":["Lee-Min Lee","Hsiao-Chuan Wang"],"meta":["February 1996Signal Processing Letters, IEEE 3(1):13 - 15","DOI:10.1109/97.475824","SourceIEEE Xplore"],"references":["221678283_Linear_Prediction_A_Tutorial_Review","221484610_ARDOSS_autoregressive_domain_spectral_subtraction_for_robust_speech_recognition_in_additive_noise","3567585_Direct_modulation_on_LPC_coefficients_with_application_to_speech_enhancement_and_improving_the_performance_of_speech_recognition_in_noise","3358814_Nonlinear_cepstral_equalisation_method_for_noisy_speech_recognition"]}
