{"id":"340689888_Introduction-Heutagogy_What_Does_It_Mean_and_Why_It_Is_Needed","abstract":"Heutagogy is a teaching-learning approach in which the students themselves determine their learning. In this chapter we define the meaning of the term heutagogy and present its basic principles. Heutagogy goes against the prevailing culture of teaching in academic institutions, which is usually teacher determined. Hence, we address the question of why it is needed. The ideas presented in this chapter will be further elaborated on in the rest of the book.","authors":["Amnon Glassner","Shlomo Back"],"meta":["April 2020","DOI:10.1007/978-981-15-4144-5_1","In book: Exploring Heutagogy in Higher Education (pp.1-8)"],"references":["301339522_From_andragogy_to_heutagogy","37357847_Moving_from_andragogy_to_heutagogy_implications_for_VET","338678255_The_Ethics_of_Authenticity","320674131_Self-determined_Learning_Heutagogy_and_Digital_Media_Creating_integrated_Educational_Environments_for_Developing_Lifelong_Learning_Skills","268800206_Self-determined_learning_heutagogy_in_action","247903727_The_Imperative_of_Responsibility","235223090_Philosophy_and_Computing_An_Introduction","234602245_Education_in_Liquid_Modernity","51122491_Commentary_Heutagogy_the_Practice_of_self-Learning","37714889_Does_Ethics_Have_A_Chance_in_A_World_of_Consumers","12181655_Social_Cognitive_Theory_An_Agentic_Perspective"]}
