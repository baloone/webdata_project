{"id":"271311425_Vehicle_Routing_Problem_with_Backhaul_Multiple_Trips_and_Time_Window","abstract":"Transportation planning is one of the important components to increase efficiency and effectiveness in the supply chain system. Good planning will give a saving in total cost of the supply chain. This paper develops the new VRP variants’, VRP with backhauls, multiple trips, and time window (VRPBMTTW) along with its problem solving techniques by using Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and Sequential Insertion as initial solution algorithm. ACO is modified by adding the decoding process in order to determine the number of vehicles, total duration time, and range of duration time regardless of checking capacity constraint and time window. This algorithm is tested by using set of random data and verified as well as analyzed its parameter changing’s. The computational results for hypothetical data with 50% backhaul and mix time windows are reported.","authors":["Johan Oscar ong","Suprayogi Suprayogi"],"meta":["June 2011Jurnal Teknik Industri 13(1)","DOI:10.9744/jti.13.1.1-10"],"references":["308953674_Ant_Colony_Optimization","255636808_SOLVING_THE_BACKHAUL_VEHICLE_ROUTING_PROBLEM_BY_GENETIC_ALGORITHMS","242916734_An_Improved_Ant_System_Algorithm_for_the_Vehicle_Routing_Problem","227724716_Classical_heuristics_for_the_vehicle_routing_problem","323395416_Tabu_Search_for_the_Vehicle_Routing_Problem_with_Multiple_Trips_Time_Windows_and_Simultaneous_Delivery-Pickup","237131491_Reactive_tabu_search_and_variable_neighbourhood_descent_applied_to_the_vehicle_routing_problem_with","228711327_A_Threshold_Accepting_Meta-Heuristic_for_the_Vehicle_Routing_Problem_with_Backhauls_and_Time_Windows","222675552_A_vehicle_routing_problem_with_backhauls_and_time_windows_A_guided_local_search_solution","222660532_An_Improved_Ant_Colony_Optimization_for_Vehicle_Routing_Problem","222528352_An_Ant_Colony_Optimization_Approach_to_the_Vehicle_Routing_Problem"]}
