{"id":"323319452_DynGENIE3_Dynamical_GENIE3_for_the_inference_of_gene_networks_from_time_series_expression_data","abstract":"The elucidation of gene regulatory networks is one of the major challenges of systems biology. Measurements about genes that are exploited by network inference methods are typically available either in the form of steady-state expression vectors or time series expression data. In our previous work, we proposed the GENIE3 method that exploits variable importance scores derived from Random forests to identify the regulators of each target gene. This method provided state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets, but it could however not specifically be applied to time series expression data. We propose here an adaptation of the GENIE3 method, called dynamical GENIE3 (dynGENIE3), for handling both time series and steady-state expression data. The proposed method is evaluated extensively on the artificial DREAM4 benchmarks and on three real time series expression datasets. Although dynGENIE3 does not systematically yield the best performance on each and every network, it is competitive with diverse methods from the literature, while preserving the main advantages of GENIE3 in terms of scalability.","authors":["VÃ¢n Anh Huynh-Thu","Pierre Geurts"],"meta":["February 2018Scientific Reports 8(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-018-21715-0"],"references":["282286023_NetBenchmark_A_bioconductor_package_for_reproducible_benchmarks_of_gene_regulatory_network_inference","278331928_Integrative_random_forest_for_gene_regulatory_network_inference","278331749_Reconstructing_gene_regulatory_dynamics_from_high-dimensional_single-cell_snapshot_data","275278913_Dynamic_regulation_of_mRNA_decay_during_neural_development","272409818_Combining_tree-based_and_dynamical_systems_for_the_inference_of_gene_regulatory_networks","329650090_Gaussian_Processes_for_Machine_Learning","308740907_Computational_methods_for_trajectory_inference_from_single-cell_transcriptomics","288906520_Random_forests","263385217_Lessons_from_the_DREAM2_Challenges_A_Community_Effort_to_Assess_Biological_Network_Inference","262026193_Bridging_physiological_and_evolutionary_time-scales_in_a_gene_regulatory_network"]}
