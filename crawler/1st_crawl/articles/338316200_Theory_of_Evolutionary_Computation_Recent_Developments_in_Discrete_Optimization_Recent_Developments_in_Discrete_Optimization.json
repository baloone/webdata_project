The book then describes theoretical results on three important questions in evolutionary computation: how to profit from changing the parameters during the run of an algorithm; how evolutionary algorithms cope with dynamically changing or stochastic environments; and how population diversity influences performance. Finally, the book looks at three algorithm classes that have only recently become the focus of theoretical work: estimation-of-distribution algorithms; artificial immune systems; and genetic programming.\nThroughout the book the contributing authors try to develop an understanding for how these methods work, and why they are so successful in many applications. The book will be useful for students and researchers in theoretical computer science and evolutionary computing.","authors":["Benjamin Doerr","Frank Neumann"],"meta":["January 2020Natural Computing Series","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-29414-4","ISBN: 978-3-030-29413-7"],"references":[]}
