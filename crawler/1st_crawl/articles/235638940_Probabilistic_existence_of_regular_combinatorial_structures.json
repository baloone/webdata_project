{"id":"235638940_Probabilistic_existence_of_regular_combinatorial_structures","abstract":"We show the existence of regular combinatorial objects which previously were\nnot known to exist. Specifically, for a wide range of the underlying\nparameters, we show the existence of non-trivial orthogonal arrays, t-designs,\nand t-wise permutations. In all cases, the sizes of the objects are optimal up\nto polynomial overhead. The proof of existence is probabilistic. We show that a\nrandomly chosen structure has the required properties with positive yet tiny\nprobability. Our method allows also to give rather precise estimates on the\nnumber of objects of a given size and this is applied to count the number of\northogonal arrays, t-designs and regular hypergraphs. The main technical\ningredient is a special local central limit theorem for suitable lattice random\nwalks with finitely many steps.","authors":["Greg Kuperberg","Shachar Lovett","Ron Peled"],"meta":["July 2017Geometric and Functional Analysis 1302(4)","DOI:10.1007/s00039-017-0416-9","SourcearXiv"],"references":["279864532_Chebyshev-Type_Quadratures_for_Doubling_Weights","321525527_Orthogonal_Arrays","315070369_Combinatorics_and_Complexity_of_Partition_Functions","314092343_Asymptotic_enumeration_of_graphs_by_degree_sequence_and_the_degree_sequence_of_a_random_graph","303335206_Six_standard_deviations_suffice","302174239_Longest_increasing_and_decreasing_subsequences_Canad","291446494_Non-trivial_t-designs_without_repeated_blocks_exist_for_all_t","268633088_Orthogonal_Arrays_Theory_and_Applications","267448125_Optimal_asymptotic_bounds_for_spherical_designs","266440583_Some_combinatorial_problems_of_arrays_and_applications_to_design_of_experiments"]}
