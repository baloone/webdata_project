{"id":"323851542_Some_New_Inequalities_With_Proofs_and_Comments_on_Applications","abstract":"This article proves several new inequalities. The proved inequalities are all integrated with the floor function and one of them gives a bound estimation for the Euler's totient of the semiprimes. Detail mathematical deductions are presented and applicable cases for each inequality are also given with technical comments.","authors":["Xingbo Wang","Zhikui DUAN","Wen WAN"],"meta":["March 2018Journal of Mathematics Research 10(3):15","DOI:10.5539/jmr.v10n3p15","Project: rsa factorization"],"references":["320009486_Brief_Summary_of_Frequently-used_Properties_of_the_Floor_Function","302589769_Valuated_Binary_Tree_A_New_Approach_in_Study_of_Integers","322751253_Generalize_estimating_the_phn_of_upperlower_bound_to_RSA_public_key_cryptosystem","279334612_Cryptanalytic_attacks_on_RSA","265460978_Applied_Inequalities"]}
