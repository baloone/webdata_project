{"id":"320498866_Novel_Solution_of_Nonlinear_Equations_Using_Genetic_Algorithm","abstract":"Nonlinear equations represent highly complex systems and their solutions by conventional methods have high computational complexity. Methods like Bisection, Regula Falsi, Newtonâ€“Raphson, Secant, Muller, etc., are used to solve such problems. This work find gaps in the existing methods and justifies the applicability of Genetic Algorithm to the problem. A Genetic Algorithm-based method has been proposed, which is more efficient and produces better results as compared to the existing methods.","authors":["Chhavi Mangla","Harsh Bhasin","Musheer Ahmad","Moin Uddin"],"meta":["October 2017","DOI:10.1007/978-981-10-3758-0_17","In book: Industrial Mathematics and Complex Systems (pp.249-257)"],"references":["284243768_Study_neighborhood_field_optimization_algorithm_on_nonlinear_sorptive_barrier_design_problems","262321208_Solving_non-linear_equations_via_genetic_algorithms","257723604_Research_on_Genetic_Algorithm_and_Data_Information_based_on_Combined_Framework_for_Nonlinear_Functions_Optimization","256937335_Solving_nonlinear_equations_system_via_an_efficient_genetic_algorithm_with_symmetric_and_harmonious_individuals","220389316_Integrating_particle_swarm_optimization_with_genetic_algorithms_for_solving_nonlinear_optimization_problems","3044356_Optimal_algorithms_for_well-conditioned_nonlinear_systems_ofequations","287233079_Solving_system_of_non-linear_equations_using_Genetic_Algorithm","283996103_Genetic_Algorithms_In_Search_Optimization_and_Machine_Learning","280013280_On_The_Applicability_of_Diploid_Genetic_Algorithms","279924925_On_The_Applicability_of_Diploid_Genetic_Algorithms_in_Dynamic_Environments","264419506_Design_of_stochastic_solvers_based_on_genetic_algorithms_for_solving_nonlinear_equations","256937473_Applying_genetic_algorithms_for_solving_nonlinear_algebraic_equations","229894123_A_new_methodology_to_solve_non-linear_equation_systems_using_genetic_algorithms_Application_to_combined_cycle_gas_turbine_simulation","223212532_An_improved_real-coded_genetic_algorithm_for_parameters_estimation_of_nonlinear_systems","222534332_Multi-objective_Optimization_using_Genetic_Algorithms_a_Tutorial","222329831_Genetic_algorithms_for_modelling_and_optimisation","220562055_A_new_method_for_solving_a_system_of_the_nonlinear_equations","220559879_GENLS_Co-evolutionary_algorithm_for_nonlinear_system_of_equations","220388747_Analytical_existence_of_solutions_to_a_system_of_nonlinear_equations_with_application","220331357_Optimal_Algorithms_for_Well-Conditioned_Nonlinear_Systems_of_Equations","220097460_An_SQP_approach_with_line_search_for_a_system_of_nonlinear_equations","215459436_Adaptation_in_Natural_and_Artificial_Systems_An_Introductory_Analysis_With_Applications_to_Biology_Control_and_Artificial_Intelligence","3412770_A_New_Approach_for_Solving_Nonlinear_Equations_Systems"]}
