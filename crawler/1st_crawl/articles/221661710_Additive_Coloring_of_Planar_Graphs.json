{"id":"221661710_Additive_Coloring_of_Planar_Graphs","abstract":"An additive coloring of a graph G is an assignment of positive integers \\({\\{1,2,\\ldots ,k\\}}\\) to the vertices of G such that for every two adjacent vertices the sums of numbers assigned to their neighbors are different. The minimum number k for which there exists an additive coloring of G is denoted by \\({\\eta (G)}\\) . We prove that \\({\\eta (G) \\, \\leqslant \\, 468}\\) for every planar graph G. This improves a previous bound \\({\\eta (G) \\, \\leqslant \\, 5544}\\) due to Norin. The proof uses Combinatorial Nullstellensatz and the coloring number of planar hypergraphs. We also demonstrate that \\({\\eta (G) \\, \\leqslant \\, 36}\\) for 3-colorable planar graphs, and \\({\\eta (G) \\, \\leqslant \\, 4}\\) for every planar graph of girth at least 13. In a group theoretic version of the problem we show that for each \\({r \\, \\geqslant \\, 2}\\) there is an r-chromatic graph G\nr\nwith no additive coloring by elements of any abelian group of order r.","authors":["Tomasz Bartnicki","Bartłomiej Bosek","Sebastian Czerwiński","Jarosław Grytczuk"],"meta":["February 2012Graphs and Combinatorics 30(5)","DOI:10.1007/s00373-013-1331-y","SourcearXiv"],"references":["220075635_Vertex-coloring_edge-weightings_Towards_the_1-2-3-conjecture","305757031_A_Short_Proof_of_Combinatorial_Nullstellensatz","242793334_Edge_weights_and_vertex_colors","238294263_Pearls_in_Graph_Theory","231992373_Combinatorial_Nullstellensatz","222153315_Lucky_labelings_of_graphs","220548994_Weight_choosability_of_graphs","220548944_Star_Coloring_of_Sparse_Graphs","220441675_Coloring_number_and_on-line_Ramsey_theory_for_graphs_and_hypergraphs","220397725_The_Sigma_Chromatic_Number_of_a_Graph"]}
