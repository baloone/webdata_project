{"id":"339340138_Neural_Stored-program_Memory","abstract":"Neural networks powered with external memory simulate computer behaviors.\nThese models, which use the memory to store data for a neural\ncontroller, can learn algorithms and other complex tasks. In this paper,\nwe introduce a new memory to store weights for the controller, analogous\nto the stored-program memory in modern computer architectures. The\nproposed model, dubbed Neural Stored-program Memory, augments current\nmemory-augmented neural networks, creating differentiable machines\nthat can switch programs through time, adapt to variable contexts and\nthus resemble the Universal Turing Machine. A wide range of experiments\ndemonstrate that the resulting machines not only excel in classical algorithmic\nproblems, but also have potential for compositional, continual, few-shot\nlearning and question-answering tasks.","authors":["Hung Le","Truyen Tran","Svetha Venkatesh"],"meta":["February 2020","Projects: Program MemoryNeural reasoningDeep learning fundamentals"],"references":["349297245_Learning_to_Remember_More_with_Less_Memorization","314943144_Continual_Learning_Through_Synaptic_Intelligence","309551291_Scaling_Memory-Augmented_Neural_Networks_with_Sparse_Reads_and_Writes","350652552_Applied_Multiple_RegressionCorrelation_Analysis_for_the_Behavioral_Sciences","334116911_Robust_and_Scalable_Differentiable_Neural_Computer_for_Question_Answering","319770117_Categorical_Reparameterization_with_Gumbel-Softmax","319769995_End-To-End_Memory_Networks","313893314_Multilevel_Modeling_and_Ordinary_Least_Squares_Regression_How_Comparable_Are_They","311610065_Neural_Module_Networks","309317293_Using_Fast_Weights_to_Attend_to_the_Recent_Past"]}
