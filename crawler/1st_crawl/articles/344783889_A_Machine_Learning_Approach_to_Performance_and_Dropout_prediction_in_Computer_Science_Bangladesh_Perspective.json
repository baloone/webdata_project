{"id":"344783889_A_Machine_Learning_Approach_to_Performance_and_Dropout_prediction_in_Computer_Science_Bangladesh_Perspective","abstract":"This is an era of computer and technology. Nowadays Computer Science (CS) and other technology-related subjects are hot cake for the students. Due to a good job market for these subjects, students are taking computer science and other related topics without thinking about their capability and without knowing the curriculum of these subjects. So dropout rate is getting high day by day in these subjects. Especially developing countries like Bangladesh. In this work we have used current computer science students data to predict their and also prospective CS students' future performance and the chance of dropout using machine learning algorithms like SVM, na√Øve Bayes, neural network, etc. We have also predicted the crucial factors that are strongly correlated to the performance of a CS student.","authors":["Sheikh Arif Ahmed","Md Aref Billah","Shahidul Islam Khan"],"meta":["October 2020","DOI:10.1109/ICCCNT49239.2020.9225356","Conference: 11th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTING, COMMUNICATION AND NETWORKING TECHNOLOGIES (ICCCNT)At: IIT Kharagpur"],"references":["315837527_Predicting_Student_Performance_using_Advanced_Learning_Analytics","277948192_A_Recommender_for_Improving_the_Student_Academic_Performance","269328957_A_neural_network_students'_performance_prediction_model_NNSPPM","344171764_Factors_that_contribute_programming_skill_and_CGPA_as_a_CS_graduate_Mining_Educational_Data","338371760_A_machine_learning_approach_to_Predict_the_Engineering_Students_at_risk_of_dropout_and_factors_behind_Bangladesh_Perspective","328834157_Predicting_Dropout_in_Higher_Education_Based_on_Secondary_School_Performance","328158354_Applying_Data_Mining_Techniques_to_Predict_Student_Dropout_A_Case_Study","326072341_Higher_education_student_dropout_prediction_and_analysis_through_educational_data_mining","313354571_Evaluating_the_effectiveness_of_educational_data_mining_techniques_for_early_prediction_of_students'_academic_failure_in_introductory_programming_courses","307572433_Using_data_mining_techniques_to_predict_students_at_risk_of_poor_performance"]}
