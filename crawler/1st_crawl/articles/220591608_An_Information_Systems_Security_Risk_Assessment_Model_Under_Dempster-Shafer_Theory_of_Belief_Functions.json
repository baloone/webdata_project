{"id":"220591608_An_Information_Systems_Security_Risk_Assessment_Model_Under_Dempster-Shafer_Theory_of_Belief_Functions","abstract":"This study develops an alternative methodology for the risk analysis of information systems security (ISS), an evidential reasoning approach under the Dempster-Shafer theory of belief functions. The approach has the following important dimensions. First, the evidential reasoning approach provides a rigorous, structured manner to incorporate relevant ISS risk factors, related countermeasures, and their interrelationships when estimating ISS risk. Second, the methodology employs the belief function definition of risk--that is, ISS risk is the plausibility of ISS failures. The proposed approach has other appealing features, such as facilitating cost- benefit analyses to help promote efficient ISS risk management. The paper elaborates the theoretical concepts and provides operational guidance for implementing the method. The method is illustrated using a hypothetical example from the perspective of management and a real-world example from the perspective of external assurance providers. Sensitivity analyses are performed to evaluate the impact of important parameters on the model's results.","authors":["Lili Sun","Rajendra P. Srivastava","Theodore J.
