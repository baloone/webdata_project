{"id":"273388479_MODS_Fast_and_robust_method_for_two-view_matching","abstract":"A novel algorithm for wide-baseline matching called MODS - Matching On Demand\nwith view Synthesis algorithm (MODS) - is presented. The MODS algorithm is\nexperimentally shown to solve a broader range of wide-baseline problems than\nthe state of the art while being nearly as fast as standard matchers on simple\nproblems. The apparent robustness vs. speed trade-off is finessed by the use of\nprogressively more time-consuming feature detectors and by on-demand generation\nof synthesized images that is performed until a reliable estimate of geometry\nis obtained.\nWe also introduce an improved method for tentative correspondence selection,\napplicable both with and without view synthesis. A modification of the standard\nfirst to second nearest distance rule increases the number of correct matches\nby 5-20% at no additional computational cost.\nPerformance of the MODS algorithm is evaluated on standard publicly available\ndatasets and on a new set of geometrically challenging wide baseline problems\nthat is made public together with the ground truth. Experiments show that the\nMODS outperforms the state-of-the-art in robustness and speed. Moreover, MODS\nperforms well on other classes of difficult two-view problems like matching of\nimages from different modalities, with wide temporal baseline or with\nsignificant lighting changes.","authors":["Dmytro Mishkin","Jiri Matas","Michal Perdoch"],"meta":["March 2015Computer Vision and Image Understanding 141","DOI:10.1016/j.cviu.2015.08.005","SourcearXiv","Project: Robust two view matching under challenging conditions"],"references":["275154871_Efficient_Image_Detail_Mining","274410731_ASIFT_An_Algorithm_for_Fully_Affine_Invariant_Comparison","319770820_Histograms_of_Oriented_Gradients_for_Human_Detection","319770493_Local_Invariant_Feature_Detectors_A_Survey","319770471_Adaptive_and_Generic_Corner_Detection_Based_on_the_Accelerated_Segment_Test","319770370_Three_things_everyone_should_know_to_improve_object_retrieval","316240097_Distinctive_Image_Features_from_Scale-Invariant_Keypoints","308642582_ASIFT_A_new_framework_for_fully_affine_invariant_image_comparison","284025054_Interesting_interest_points","275057952_SURF_Speeded_up_robust_features","264275973_A_Few_Things_One_Should_Know_About_Feature_Extraction_Description_and_Matching","263491566_Interesting_Interest_Points_A_Comparative_Study_of_Interest_Point_Performance_on_a_Unique_Data_Set","262571664_Erratum_to_Interesting_Interest_Points","261336856_Image_Matching_using_Local_Symmetry_Features","269250429_Ultra-wide_Baseline_Aerial_Imagery_Matching_in_Urban_Environments"]}
