{"id":"269877142_Efficient_Decision-Making_by_Volume-Conserving_Physical_Object","abstract":"We demonstrate that any physical object, as long as its volume is conserved\nwhen coupled with suitable operations, provides a sophisticated decision-making\ncapability. We consider the problem of finding, as accurately and quickly as\npossible, the most profitable option from a set of options that gives\nstochastic rewards. These decisions are made as dictated by a physical object,\nwhich is moved in a manner similar to the fluctuations of a rigid body in a\ntug-of-war game. Our analytical calculations validate statistical reasons why\nour method exhibits higher efficiency than conventional algorithms.","authors":["Song-Ju Kim","Masashi Aono","Etsushi Nameda"],"meta":["October 2014New Journal of Physics 17(8)","DOI:10.1088/1367-2630/17/8/083023","SourcearXiv"],"references":["316442066_Bandit_Processes_and_Dynamic_Allocation_Indices_with_discussion","295256070_CMOS_Circuit_Design_Layout_and_Simulation_Third_Edition","270443256_Amoeba-inspired_algorithm_for_cognitive_medium_access","267039524_Decision_making_based_on_optical_excitation_transfer_via_near-field_interactions_between_quantum_dots","255715069_ERRATUM_Decision_Maker_based_on_Nanoscale_Photo-excitation_Transfer","292520756_Erratum_Decision_maker_based_on_nanoscale_photo-excitation_transfer_Scientific_Reports_2013_32370_DOI_101038srep02370","265534912_The_Universal_Turing_Machine_A_Half-Century_Survey","259513559_Amoeba-Inspired_Tug-of-War_Algorithms_for_Exploration-Exploitation_Dilemma_in_Extended_Bandit_Problem","247441127_Sample_Mean_Based_Index_Policies_with_Olog_n_Regret_for_the_Multi-Armed_Bandit_Problem","236234970_Tug-of-war_model_for_the_two-bandit_problem_Nonlocally-correlated_parallel_exploration_via_resource_conservation"]}
