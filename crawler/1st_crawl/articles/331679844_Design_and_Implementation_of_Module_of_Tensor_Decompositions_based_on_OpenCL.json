{"id":"331679844_Design_and_Implementation_of_Module_of_Tensor_Decompositions_based_on_OpenCL","abstract":"Tensor is a data aggregate that can expand data linear relationship from low order to high order. Tensor don't need to dimension reduction when tensor was analyzed. In this way, Tensor, this new concept, was widely used in the field of computer science in recent years. Tensor decompositions, as the mainly diagnostic tool of tensor, is widely applied in data mining, machine learning, etc. There are two basic tensor decompositions: CANDECOMP/PARAFAC Decompositions (abbreviated as CP Decompositions) and Tucker Decompositions. They all have a lot of iterations and matrix multiplications, which is not suitable to operator on CPU platform. In this paper, we design a module for Tensor Decompositions based on OpenCL. Considering that OpenCL platform is good at iterations and matrix multiplications. This module will highly improve the effectivity of Tensor Decompositions.","authors":["Zhou Qi","Chai Xiao Li","Ma Ke Jie","Yu Ze Ren"],"meta":["February 2019Journal of Physics Conference Series 1168(6):062028","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/1168/6/062028"],"references":["285805406_On_the_best_rank-l_and_rank-Rl_R2_Rn_approximation_of_higher_order_tensors","262256284_On_the_best_rank-1_and_rank-R_1_R_2_R_N_approximation_of_higher-order_tensors","245153728_Improving_the_Speed_of_Multi-way_Algorithms_Part_I_Tucker3","228866250_A_Multi-Linear_Singular_Value_Decomposition","24062401_Principal_Component_Analysis_of_Three-mode_Data_by_Means_of_Alternating_Least_Squares_Algorithm","318126490_On_Optimizing_Distributed_Tucker_Decomposition_for_Dense_Tensors","220116494_Tensor_Decompositions_and_Applications","24061805_Some_Mathematical_Notes_on_Three-Mode_Factor_Analysis"]}
