{"id":"348773583_A_Brain-Inspired_Decision-Making_Linear_Neural_Network_and_Its_Application_in_Automatic_Drive","abstract":"Brain-like intelligent decision-making is a prevailing trend in today’s world. However, inspired by bionics and computer science, the linear neural network has become one of the main means to realize human-like decision-making and control. This paper proposes a method for classifying drivers’ driving behaviors based on the fuzzy algorithm and establish a brain-inspired decision-making linear neural network. Firstly, different driver experimental data samples were obtained through the driving simulator. Then, an objective fuzzy classification algorithm was designed to distinguish different driving behaviors in terms of experimental data. In addition, a brain-inspired linear neural network was established to realize human-like decision-making and control. Finally, the accuracy of the proposed method was verified by training and testing. This study extracts the driving characteristics of drivers through driving simulator tests, which provides a driving behavior reference for the human-like decision-making of an intelligent vehicle.","authors":["Tianjun Sun","Zhenhai Gao","Fei Gao","Tianyao Zhang"],"meta":["January 2021Sensors 21(3):794","DOI:10.3390/s21030794"],"references":["341631202_Deep_Neural_Network-Based_In-Vehicle_People_Localization_Using_Ultra-Wideband_Radar","339258461_Vehicle_Automatic_Iterative_Learning_Control_based_on_Drivers'_Starting_Behavior","336526736_Design_of_Vehicle_Automatic_Braking_Systems_Considering_Drivers'_Braking_Characteristics","333567835_Decision-making_method_for_vehicle_longitudinal_automatic_driving_based_on_reinforcement_Q-learning","327578136_A_Brain-Inspired_Decision-Making_Spiking_Neural_Network_and_Its_Application_in_Unmanned_Aerial_Vehicle","325984939_Modeling_and_Characterization_of_Traffic_Flows_in_Urban_Environments","344924525_Smart_Urbanism_Autonomous_Vehicle_Decision-Making_Algorithms_and_Big_Data-driven_Transportation_Networks","342909468_Linear-Model-Inspired_Neural_Network_for_Electromagnetic_Inverse_Scattering","337725214_Type-2_fuzzy_control_for_driving_state_and_behavioral_decisions_of_unmanned_vehicle","332789322_Using_advanced_adaptive_cruise_control_systems_to_reduce_congestion_at_sags_An_evaluation_based_on_microscopic_traffic_simulation"]}
