{"id":"299467631_Design_of_basic_sequential_circuits_using_reversible_logic","abstract":"Reversible logic is an emerging research area. Its\nability to reduce the power dissipation has made these circuits\nlossless circuits. Irreversible circuits or classical circuits have\nenergy dissipation is proportional to the number of bits lost\nduring computation. The reversible circuits do not lose\ninformation and can generate unique outputs from specified\ninputs and vice versa. It has application in diverse fields such as\nlow power CMOS design, optical information processing,\ncryptography, quantum computation and nanotechnology. This\npaper proposes a reversible design of Flip Flops, Counters and\nUniversal shift register. Universal shift register is an important\nmemory element of the sequential circuit family. In this paper we\nproposed efficient design of reversible universal shift register that\nis optimized in terms of quantum cost, delay, garbage outputs .\nEach module has been coded using Verilog then simulated using\nModelsim and prototyped in Xilinx-Spartan 3.","authors":["Rohini Hongal"],"meta":["March 2016","DOI:10.1109/ICEEOT.2016.7755062","Conference: International conference on electrical, electronics, and optimization techniques(ICEEOT)-2016At: chennai"],"references":["276200730_Design_of_Reversible_Sequential_Circuit_Using_Reversible_Logic_Synthesis","258991370_A_Novel_Design_of_Reversible_Universal_Shift_Register_with_Reduced_Delay_and_Quantum_Cost","244956458_A_general_decomposition_for_reversible_logic","228357393_A_beginning_in_the_reversible_logic_synthesis_of_sequential_circuits","224647507_A_new_look_at_reversible_memory_elements","220365620_Design_of_Reversible_Sequential_Circuits_Optimizing_Quantum_Cost_Delay_and_Garbage_Outputs","3225564_Reversible_Cascades_With_Minimal_Garbage","2201383_Quantum_Networks_for_Elementary_Arithmetic_Operations","291004936_N_Ranganathan_Design_of_reversible_sequential_circuits_optimizing_quantum_cost_delay_and_garbage_outputs_ACM_J_Emerg_Technol_Comput_Syst_64","287135226_Irreversibility_and_heat_generation_in_the_computing_process","255754617_Design_of_a_Reversible_Parallel_Loading_Shift_Register","226483600_Quantum_Mechanical_Computers","224714400_Design_of_Reversible_Sequential_Elements_With_Feasibility_of_Transistor_Implementation","224105116_Irreversibility_and_Heat_Generation_in_the_Computing_Process","224104463_Logical_Reversibility_of_Computation","215515923_Design_of_Counters_Using_Reversible_Logic","45925425_Optimization_of_reversible_sequential_circuits","13376333_Five_two-bit_quantum_gates_are_sufficient_to_implement_the_quantum_Fredkin_gate"]}
