{"id":"234083279_Optimal_Information_Transfer_and_Real-Vector-Space_Quantum_Theory","abstract":"Consider a photon that has just emerged from a linear polarizing filter. If\nthe photon is then subjected to an orthogonal polarization measurement-e.g.,\nhorizontal vs vertical-the photon's preparation cannot be fully expressed in\nthe outcome: a binary outcome cannot reveal the value of a continuous variable.\nHowever, a stream of identically prepared photons can do much better. To\nquantify this effect, one can compute the mutual information between the angle\nof polarization and the observed frequencies of occurrence of \"horizontal\" and\n\"vertical.\" Remarkably, one finds that the quantum-mechanical rule for\ncomputing probabilities--Born's rule--maximizes this mutual information\nrelative to other conceivable probability rules. However, the maximization is\nachieved only because linear polarization can be modeled with a real state\nspace; the argument fails when one considers the full set of complex states.\nThis result generalizes to higher dimensional Hilbert spaces: in every case,\none finds that information is transferred optimally from preparation to\nmeasurement in the real-vector-space theory but not in the complex theory.\nAttempts to modify the statement of the problem so as to see a similar\noptimization in the standard complex theory are not successful (with one\nlimited exception). So it seems that this optimization should be regarded as a\nspecial feature of real-vector-space quantum theory.","authors":["William K.
