{"id":"342380016_Superconducting_Quantum_Computing_A_Review","abstract":"Over the last two decades, tremendous advances have been made for constructing large-scale quantum computers. In particular, quantum computing platforms based on superconducting qubits have become the leading candidate for scalable quantum processor architecture, and the milestone of demonstrating quantum supremacy is first achieved using 53 superconducting qubits in 2019. In this work, we provide a brief review on the experimental efforts towards the large-scale superconducting quantum computer, including qubit design, quantum control, readout techniques, and the implementations of error correction and quantum algorithms. Besides the state of the art, we finally discuss future perspectives, and which we hope will motivate further research.","authors":["He-Liang Huang","Dachao Wu","Daojin Fan","Xiaobo Zhu"],"meta":["June 2020Sciece China.
