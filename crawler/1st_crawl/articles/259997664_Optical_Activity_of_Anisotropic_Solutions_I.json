{"id":"259997664_Optical_Activity_of_Anisotropic_Solutions_I","abstract":"General theory of optical rotation is developed for transparent solutions in which the orientational distribution of solute molecules is given arbitrary. The theory of Stephen and Hameka is generalized to derive a formula giving the rotation angle in terms of the orientational distribution function and matrix elements of the solute molecule. The rotation angle is a sum of molecular rotations (contribution from individual molecules), which depend on the orientation of the molecules relative to the incident light. The molecular rotation is given as a series, which converges very rapidly when the characteristic length of the molecule is small compared with the wavelength of the incident light. If we approximate the series by the first two terms, which is valid for most cases, the optical rotation Î± is given by the equation,","authors":["Nobuhiro Go"],"meta":["August 1965The Journal of Chemical Physics vol 43(4):1275-1280","DOI:10.1063/1.1696914"],"references":["252635536_Optical_Activity_in_Absorbing_Media","242839748_Optical_Rotatory_Power_of_Turbid_Solutions_in_an_Electric_Field","234936406_Theory_of_Magnetic_Rotation_Spectra","231942531_Double_refraction_phenomena_in_quantum_field_theory","231504529_The_Optical_Rotation_of_Oriented_Helices_I_Electrical_Orientation_of_Poly-g-benzyl-L-glutamate_in_Ethylene_Dichloride","231427396_The_Influence_of_an_External_Electric_Field_on_the_Optical_Activity_of_Fluids","226925075_Quantenmechanische_Theorie_der_Naturlichen_Optischen_Aktivitat_von_Flussigkeiten_und_Gasen"]}
