{"id":"322836834_Sequence_Classification_for_Credit-Card_Fraud_Detection","abstract":"Due to the growing volume of electronic payments, the monetary strain of credit-card fraud is turning into a substantial challenge for financial institutions and service providers, thus forcing them to continuously improve their fraud detection systems. However, modern data-driven and learning-based methods, despite their popularity in other domains, only slowly find their way into business applications. In this paper, we phrase the fraud detection problem as a sequence classification task and employ Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to incorporate transaction sequences. We also integrate state-of-the-art feature aggregation strategies and report our results by means of traditional retrieval metrics. A comparison to a baseline random forest (RF) classifier showed that the LSTM improves detection accuracy on offline transactions where the card-holder is physically present at a merchant. Both the sequential and non-sequential learning approaches benefit strongly from manual feature aggregation strategies. A subsequent analysis of true positives revealed that both approaches tend to detect different frauds, which suggests a combination of the two. We conclude our study with a discussion on both practical and scientific challenges that remain unsolved.","authors":["Johannes Jurgovsky","Michael Granitzer","Konstantin Ziegler","Sylvie Calabretto"],"meta":["June 2018Expert Systems with Applications 100","DOI:10.1016/j.eswa.2018.01.037","Project: Fraud detection with machine learning"],"references":["319867396_Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection_A_Realistic_Modeling_and_a_Novel_Learning_Strategy","312255358_A_data_mining_based_system_for_credit-card_fraud_detection_in_e-tail","276292138_Ensemble_of_Example-Dependent_Cost-Sensitive_Decision_Trees","266201822_Natural_Language_Processing_Almost_from_Scratch","226869920_Credit_Card_Transactions_Fraud_Detection_and_Machine_Learning_Modelling_Time_with_LSTM_Recurrent_Neural_Networks","225586212_Transaction_aggregation_as_a_strategy_for_credit_card_fraud_detection","224384174_Isolation_Forest","223074905_Generalization_of_Backpropagation_with_Application_to_a_Recurrent_Gas_Market_Model","221214719_LOF_Identifying_Density-Based_Local_Outliers","220543125_SMOTE_Synthetic_Minority_Over-sampling_Technique","220451886_Hellinger_distance_decision_trees_are_robust_and_skew-insensitive","215721831_The_Relationship_Between_Precision-Recall_and_ROC_Curves","51969319_Scikit-learn_Machine_Learning_in_Python","46887451_A_Comprehensive_Survey_of_Data_Mining-based_Fraud_Detection_Research","13853244_Long_Short-term_Memory","5583935_Learning_long-term_dependencies_with_gradient_descent_is_difficult","316805444_LOMA_A_Local_Outlier_Mining_Algorithm_Based_on_Attribute_Relevance_Analysis","301307481_Fraud_Detection_System_A_survey","289585253_Feature_Engineering_Strategies_for_Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection","286794765_Dropout_A_Simple_Way_to_Prevent_Neural_Networks_from_Overfitting","284039049_Recursive_deep_models_for_semantic_compositionality_over_a_sentiment_treebank","278401392_Detecting_credit_card_fraud_by_Modified_Fisher_Discriminant_Analysis","276152711_APATE_A_Novel_Approach_for_Automated_Credit_Card_Transaction_Fraud_Detection_using_Network-Based_Extensions","270877509_Learning_Sentiment-Specific_Word_Embedding_for_Twitter_Sentiment_Classification","268750353_Minimal_infrequent_pattern_based_approach_for_mining_outliers_in_data_streams","265554383_Sequence_to_Sequence_Learning_with_Neural_Networks","257404996_A_cost-sensitive_decision_tree_approach_for_fraud_detection","257404111_Employing_transaction_aggregation_strategy_to_detect_credit_card_fraud","229091480_Learning_Representations_by_Back_Propagating_Errors","228057950_Conditional_Random_Fields_Probabilistic_Models_for_Segmenting_and_Labeling_Sequence_Data","224360197_Exploratory_Undersampling_for_Class-Imbalance_Learning","222578477_The_application_of_data_mining_techniques_in_financial_fraud_detection_A_classification_framework_and_an_academic_review_of_literature","222534617_Data_mining_for_credit_card_fraud_A_comparative_study","222449846_Finding_Structure_in_Time","222418989_A_hybrid_model_for_plastic_card_fraud_detection_systems","221480736_Empirical_Evaluation_and_Combination_of_Advanced_Language_Modeling_Techniques","36419563_Supervised_Sequence_Labelling_with_Recurrent_Neural_Networks","3449469_Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection_Using_Hidden_Markov_Model","2247421_Bifurcations_of_Recurrent_Neural_Networks_in_Gradient_Descent_Learning"]}
