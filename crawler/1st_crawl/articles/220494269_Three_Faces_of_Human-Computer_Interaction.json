{"id":"220494269_Three_Faces_of_Human-Computer_Interaction","abstract":"Human-computer interaction is considered a core element of computer science. Yet it has not coalesced; many researchers who identify their focus as human-computer interaction reside in other fields. The author examines the origins and evolution of three HCI research foci: computer operation, information systems management, and discretionary use. Efforts to find common ground and forces that have kept them apart are described.","authors":["Jonathan Grudin"],"meta":["November 2005IEEE Annals of the History of Computing 27(4):46-62","DOI:10.1109/MAHC.2005.67","SourceDBLP"],"references":["290989872_Information_technology_to_support_electronic_meetings","258846992_Perceived_Usefulness_Perceived_Ease_Of_Use_And_User_Accep","250890525_Direct_Manipulation_Interfaces","245033301_A_Brief_History_of_Human_Computer_Interaction_Technology","234799141_User_Technology_From_Pointing_to_Pondering","234786999_Softening_Up_Hard_Science_Reply_to_Newell_and_Card","230735300_Information_Technology_to_Support_Electronic_Meetings","312991281_Management_misinformation_systems","312984568_Perceived_usefulness_perceived_ease_and_user_acceptance_of_information_technology","306203652_The_principles_of_scientific_management","303403543_Computer_Systems_Development_History_Organization_and_Implementation","303309464_Sketchpad_a_man-machine_graphical_communication_system","301045660_Critical_Acclaim_for_HCI_Models_Theories_and_Frameworks","269034088_Sketching_for_knowledge_capture","269032324_Designing_for_usability_Key_principles_and_what_designers_think","264932506_Knowledge-based_systems_Implications_for_human-computer_interfaces","262008068_Funology_From_Usability_to_Enjoyment","259703683_Guidelines_for_designing_user_interface_software_ESD-TR-86-278","255641242_ADAPTING_A_PSYCHOPHYSICAL_METHOD_TO_MEASURE_PERFORMANCE_AND_PREFERENCE_TRADEOFFS_IN_HUMAN-COMPUTER_INTERACTION","248618726_The_''''Thinking_Aloud''''_Method_in_Inter_-_face_Evaluation","248617815_The_Commercial_Impact_of_Usability_in_Interactive_Systems","248597895_HCI_studies_in_Management_Information_Systems","248539046_42_A_File_Structure_for_The_Complex_The_Changing_and_the_Indeterminate","247958271_The_psychology_of_everyday_things_Basic_Books_Inc","247896366_The_History_of_Human_Factors_and_Ergonomics","245683700_Cognitive_ergonomics_and_human-computer_interaction","242616332_As_we_may_think_The_Atlantic_Monthly","242592291_Design_of_man-computer_dialogues","242569963_From_Human_Factors_to_Human_Actors_The_Role_of_Psychology_and_Human-Computer_Interaction_Studies_in_System_Design","242538562_Cognitive_engineering_in_user_centered_system_design","242435042_Design_of_Man-Computer_Dialogue","242375192_Usability_engineering_at_a_discount","238690762_A_conceptual_framework_for_the_augmentation_of_man's_intellect","235989365_Designing_Interaction_Psychology_at_the_Human-Computer_Interface","235700798_Human_problem_solving","234824978_A_conceptual_framework_for_man-machine_everything","234822060_The_evolution_of_human-computer_interaction_during_the_telecommunications_revolution","234795133_Learning_to_use_a_text_processing_system_Evidence_from_thinking_aloud_protocols","234793055_Computer_Systems_Development_History_Organization_and_Implementation","234789878_Farewell_to_Grace_Hopper-end_of_an_era","234786227_Evolution_of_human-computer_interaction_from_Memex_to_Bluetooth_and_beyond","233475992_Ergonomics_in_the_design_of_a_large_digital_computer_console","232639215_On-Line_Man-Computer_Communication_PDF","232554547_Bridging_between_basic_theories_and_the_artifacts_of_human-computer_interaction","232282375_Funology_From_Usability_to_Enjoyment","229067897_The_Prospects_for_Psychological_Science_in_Human-Computer_Interaction","227842469_Human-Computer_Interaction-Whence_and_whither","227447617_The_Evolution_of_Research_on_Information_Systems_A_Fiftieth-Year_Survey_of_the_Literature_in_Management_Science","227445868_A_Foundation_For_The_Study_Of_Group_Decision_Support_Systems","227445565_An_Experimental_Evaluation_of_Graphical_and_Color-Enhanced_Information_Presentation","224927652_Emotional_Design_Why_We_Love_or_Hate_Everyday_Things","224333290_The_Education_of_a_Computer","223322029_Computer_text-editing_An_information-processing_analysis_of_a_routine_cognitive_skill","221514283_The_computer_reaches_out_the_historical_continuity_of_interface_design","221329805_A_Comprehensive_Method_for_Handling_the_Human_Problems_of_Computer_Introduction"]}
