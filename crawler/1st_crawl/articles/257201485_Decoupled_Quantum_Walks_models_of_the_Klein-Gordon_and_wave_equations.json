{"id":"257201485_Decoupled_Quantum_Walks_models_of_the_Klein-Gordon_and_wave_equations","abstract":"Decoupling a vectorial PDE consists in solving the system for each component,\nthereby obtaining scalar PDEs that prescribe the evolution of each component\nindependently. We present a general approach to decoupling of Quantum Walks,\nagain defined as a procedure to obtain an evolution law for each scalar\ncomponent of the QW, in such a way that it does not depend on the other\ncomponents. In particular, the method is applied to show the relation between\nthe Dirac (or Weyl) Quantum Walk in three space dimensions with (or without)\nmass term, and the Klein-Gordon (or wave) equation.","authors":["Pablo Arrighi","Stefano Facchini"],"meta":["September 2013EPL (Europhysics Letters) 104(6)","DOI:10.1209/0295-5075/104/60004","SourcearXiv"],"references":["249012022_The_Dirac_equation_as_a_quantum_walk_Higher_dimensions_observational_convergence","237082442_Derivation_of_the_Dirac_Equation_from_Principles_of_Information_Processing","228683402_Relationship_Between_Quantum_Walk_and_Relativistic_Quantum_Mechanics","51952961_Discrete-time_quantum_walks_Continuous_limit_symmetries","13272484_Weyl_Dirac_and_Maxwell_equations_on_a_lattice_as_unitary_cellular_automata","2728035_From_Quantum_Cellular_Automata_To_Quantum_Lattice_Gases","2195880_From_Dirac_to_Diffusion_Decoherence_in_Quantum_Lattice_Gases","316799290_Undergraduate_Algebra","281037616_Undergraduate_Texts_in_Mathematics","245900402_Determinants_of_Block_Matrices","236545475_The_Dirac_Equation","234969258_Relativistic_effects_and_rigorous_limits_for_discrete-_and_continuous-time_quantum_walks","233885961_Quantum_Field_as_a_Quantum_Cellular_Automaton_I_the_Dirac_freeevolution_in_one_dimension","226810696_Simulating_physics_with_computers_Int_J_Theor_Phys_2167467-488","222048848_Lattice_Boltzmann_Equation_for_Quantum_Mechanics","51153039_Isotropy_of_three-dimensional_quantum_lattice_Boltzmann_schemes","2772288_Simulating_Quantum_Mechanics_on_a_Quantum_Computer"]}
