{"id":"342013650_Energy_and_Mass_Transport_of_Micropolar_Nanofluid_Flow_over_an_Inclined_Surface_with_Keller_box_Simulation","abstract":"In this problem, micropolarNanofluidboundary layer flow over slanted stretching surface with Soret and Dufoureffect studied.The inclined stretching surface in this study is considered permeable and linear. In this problem Buongiorno model is considered for thermal efficiencies of fluid flow in the existence of Brownian movement and thermophoresis properties. The nonlinear problem for MicropolarNanofluid flow over slanted channel is developedto think about the heat and mass exchange phenomenon by incorporatingportent flow factorsto strengthened boundary layers. In this work, nonlinear partial differential equations are converted to nonlinear ordinary differential equations by utilizing appropriatesimilarity transformations then elucidated the numerical outcomes by the Keller-Box technique.An examination of the set up results is performed with accessible outcomes and perceived in good settlement without involved impacts. Numerical and graphical outcomes are additionally displayed in tables and charts.","authors":["Khuram Rafique","M.
