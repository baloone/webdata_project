{"id":"328556039_MPC_Under_IEC-61499_Using_Low-Cost_Devices_for_Oil_Pipeline_System","abstract":"A Model Predictive Control (MPC) system allows to optimize the work of a process by a series of predictions of its possible inputs and outputs. It is fully compatible with linear and non-linear systems, but at the requirement of a controller with the enough processing capabilities to ensure that all the involved operations are done in real time. IEC-61499 standard seeks the maximum compatibility among the devices that works under it. This is done by generating a series of generic functions under high level programming languages, making it possible to develop high complexity algorithms. The standard's main requirement for its implementation, is the use of a control device with an embedded software. The research presents a low-cost hardware reutilization, based on the develop under IEC-61499 standard of a control function encapsulating a MPC algorithm and communication functions that allow a development card Raspberry Pi 3B to take full control of the Programmable Logic Controller's (PLC) operation involved in the pump control of an oil pipeline pumping station, making it possible to combine the physical strengths of a PLC with the processing capabilities of an embedded controller.","authors":["Carlos A Garcia","Esteban X Castellanos","Jorge Buele","John Espinoza"],"meta":["July 2018","DOI:10.1109/INDIN.2018.8472094","Conference: 2018 IEEE 16th International Conference on Industrial Informatics (INDIN)At: Porto, Portugal"],"references":["322530359_Towards_an_Industry_40_Compliant_Control_Software_Architecture_Using_IEC_61499_OPC_UA","321742095_Fuzzy_control_implementation_in_low_cost_CPPS_devices","319145443_Automatic_HVAC_Control_with_Real-time_Occupancy_Recognition_and_Simulation-guided_Model_Predictive_Control_in_Low-cost_Embedded_System","318287930_Emulation_of_cyber-physical_systems_using_IEC-61499","271417900_Design_implementation_and_experimental_validation_of_explicit_MPC_in_programmable_logic_controller","261350645_Online_ANFIS_controller_based_on_RBF_identification_and_PSO","324376440_MPC-based_power_management_strategy_to_reduce_power_loss_in_energy_storage_system_of_a_HEV","321987038_Real-time_data_acquisition_support_for_IEC_61499_based_industrial_cyber-physical_systems","321821637_Enabling_an_automation_architecture_of_CPPs_based_on_UML_combined_with_IEC-61499","321357274_CPPS_on_low_cost_devices_for_batch_process_under_IEC-61499_and_ISA-88","318752388_Engineering_tool_to_develop_CPPS_based_on_IEC-61499_and_OPC_UA_for_oilgas_process","318296385_Comparison_of_PID_controller_tuning_methods_analyticalclassical_techniques_versus_optimization_algorithms","312485668_Model_predictive_control_design_and_performance_analysis_of_a_pasteurization_process_plant","309757973_Integration_of_IEC_61499_with_OPC_UA","282795132_The_design_of_the_hybrid_PID-ANFIS_controller_for_speed_control_of_brushless_DC_motor","270518030_ANFIS_and_Fuzzy_Tuning_of_PID_Controller_for_Trajectory_Tracking_of_a_Flexible_Hydraulically_Driven_Parallel_Robot_Machine","269306085_A_comparative_study_of_PID_ANFIS_and_hybrid_PID-ANFIS_controllers_for_speed_control_of_Brushless_DC_Motor_drive","269261622_Embedded_Model_Predictive_Control_MPC_Using_a_FPGA","228912471_Embedded_model_predictive_control_MPC_using_a_FPGA","220799224_Modulo_scheduling_for_highly_customized_datapaths_to_increase_hardware_reusability"]}
