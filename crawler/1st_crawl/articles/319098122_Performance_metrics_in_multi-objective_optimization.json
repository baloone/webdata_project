{"id":"319098122_Performance_metrics_in_multi-objective_optimization","abstract":"In the last decades, a large number of metrics has been proposed to compare the performance of different evolutionary approaches in multi-objective optimization. This situation leads to difficulties when comparisons among the output of different algorithms are needed and appropriate metrics must be selected to perform those comparisons. Hence, no complete agreement on what metrics should be used exists. This paper presents a review and analysis of 54 multi-objective-optimization metrics in the specialized literature, discussing the usage, tendency and advantages/disadvantages of the most cited ones in order to give researchers enough information when choosing metrics is necessary. The hypervolume metric emerged as the most accepted metric, followed by the generational distance, the epsilon indicator and the inverted generational distance.","authors":["Nery Riquelme-Granada","Christian Von LÃ¼cken","Benjamin Baran"],"meta":["October 2015","DOI:10.1109/CLEI.2015.7360024","Conference: Latin American Computing Conference (CLEI)","Project: Multi-objective optimization"],"references":["279673734_A_Steady_Performance_Stopping_Criterion_for_Pareto-based_Evolutionary_Algorithms","322619928_Pareto_simulated_annealing-a_metaheuristic_technique_for_multiple-objective_combinatorial_optimization","313705486_RM-MEDA_A_regularity_model_based_multiobjective_estimation_of_distribution_algorithm","313395358_Difficulties_in_specifying_reference_points_to_calculate_the_inverted_generational_distance_for_many-objective_optimization_problems","311174941_Pareto_simulated_annealinga_metaheuristic_technique_for_multipleobjective_combinatorial_optimization","308160985_Improving_PSO-based_multi-objective_optimization_using_crowding_mutation_and_6-dominance","295075072_EVALUATING_PERFORMANCE_OF_MULTI-OBJECTIVE_GENETIC_ALGORITHMS_FOR_WATER_DISTRIBUTION_SYSTEM_OPTIMIZATION","290852708_Difficulties_in_specifying_reference_points_to_calculate_the_inverted_generational_distance_for_many-objective_optimization_problems","284004639_The_Hypervolume_Indicator_Revisited_On_the_Design_of_Pareto-compliant_Indicators_Via_Weighted_Integration","274834977_Clustering_Based_Parallel_Many-Objective_Evolutionary_Algorithms_Using_the_Shape_of_the_Objective_Vectors"]}
