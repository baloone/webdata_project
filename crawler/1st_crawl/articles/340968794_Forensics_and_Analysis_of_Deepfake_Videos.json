{"id":"340968794_Forensics_and_Analysis_of_Deepfake_Videos","abstract":"The spread of smartphones with high quality digital cameras in combination with easy access to a myriad of software apps for recording, editing and sharing videos and digital images in combination with deep learning AI platforms has spawned a new phenomenon of faking videos known as Deepfake. We design and implement a deep-fake detection model with mouth features (DFT-MF), using deep learning approach to detect Deepfake videos by isolating, analyzing and verifying lip/mouth movement. Experiments conducted against datasets that contain both fake and real videos showed favorable classification performance for DFT-MF model especially when compared with other work in this area","authors":["Mousa Tayseer Jafar","Mohammad Ababneh","Mohammed Al-Zoube","Ammar Elhassan"],"meta":["April 2020","DOI:10.1109/ICICS49469.2020.239493","Conference: 2020 11th International Conference on Information and Communication Systems (ICICS)"],"references":["330791801_MesoNet_a_Compact_Facial_Video_Forgery_Detection_Network","319284586_Two-Stream_Neural_Networks_for_Tampered_Face_Detection","346702379_Multi-task_Learning_for_Detecting_and_Segmenting_Manipulated_Facial_Images_and_Videos","332791104_Exposing_Deep_Fakes_Using_Inconsistent_Head_Poses","331108602_Deepfake_Video_Detection_Using_Recurrent_Neural_Networks","331037289_Exploiting_Visual_Artifacts_to_Expose_Deepfakes_and_Face_Manipulations","330797421_In_Ictu_Oculi_Exposing_AI_Created_Fake_Videos_by_Detecting_Eye_Blinking","319770291_Very_Deep_Convolutional_Networks_for_Large-Scale_Image_Recognition","304552788_FaceNet_A_unified_embedding_for_face_recognition_and_clustering","301452548_Deep_Face_Recognition"]}
