{"id":"291463163_Using_Excel_for_Duct_Calculations_User_Defined_Functions","abstract":"User defined functions (UDF) can be used as alternative methods to perform duct calculations. Calculations can be performed manually in a standard spreadsheet before writing the UDF procedure. It can also be easily tested, debugged, and verified for accuracy. The procedure used to create these functions is a form of iterative problem solving method, while a solution of the Colebrook Equation can be used in some cases. The general approach involved in UDFs is composed of a number of steps. Some of these steps include determining the range over which the unknown factor will be calculated and performing a series of calculations where the difference between the design and the actual value is calculated. Some other steps include finding an initial value for the unknown factor and performing a series of calculations on the basis of the earlier step.","authors":["Thomas G.
