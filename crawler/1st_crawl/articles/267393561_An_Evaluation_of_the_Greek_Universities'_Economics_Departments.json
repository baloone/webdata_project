{"id":"267393561_An_Evaluation_of_the_Greek_Universities'_Economics_Departments","abstract":"This study provides a ranking of Economics Departments of Greek universities. Contrary to the existing literature, we look directly at the citations of the faculty members as a measure of academic performance and avoid the classification of journals. Additionally, the country of the PhD studies was found to be a significant variable that can explain the productivity of Greek economists. PhD holders from US and UK universities are characterized by higher productivity compared to those from other countries.","authors":["Stelios Katranidis","Theodore Panagiotidis","Kostas Zontanos"],"meta":["April 2014Bulletin of Economic Research 66(2):307-3378","DOI:10.1111/j.1467-8586.2012.00434.x"],"references":["279625872_Hirsch-type_indices_for_ranking_institutions'_scientific_research_output_4","260792438_University_Funding_Systems_Impact_on_Research_and_Teaching","238344381_Liquidity_Asset_Prices_and_Financial_Policy","237292494_Evaluating_Greek_Departments_of_Computer_ScienceEngineering_using_Bibliometric_Indices","222694235_Illiquidity_and_Stock_Returns_Cross-Section_and_Time-Series_Effects","221678738_Rational_Successive_h-Indices_An_Application_to_Economics_in_the_Republic_of_Ireland","220365135_Successive_h-indices","220364856_Ranking_university_departments_using_the_mean_h-index","46475365_Why_Are_they_Doing_so_Well_while_We_Are_Doing_so_Badly_A_Comparison_between_the_Canadian_and_Italian_University_Systems","311450367_The_cross-section_of_expected_stock_returns","277505193_Transaction_Costs_Order_Placement_Strategy_and_Existence_of_the_Bid-Ask_Spread","272488571_Measuring_Security_Price_Performance","263225659_Liquidity_and_Stock_Returns_An_Alternative_Test","259480025_The_Cross-Section_of_Expected_Stock_Returns","257049342_The_use_of_multiple_indicators_in_the_assessment_of_basic_research","256557256_Asset_Pricing_and_the_Bid-Ask_Spread","256557246_Stock_return_variance_The_arrival_of_information_and_the_reaction_of_traders","256557172_Dealership_Market_Market_Making_with_Inventory","248636626_Measuring_Security_Price_Information","247883608_Liquidity_and_Stock_Returns","247406627_Revealed_Performances_A_Worldwide_Ranking_of_Economists_and_Economics_Departments","247059039_Interrelationship_among_the_price_indexes_of_the_NYSE_AMEX_and_OTC","246703493_Liquidity_and_Asset_Prices_Financial_Management_Implications","245066764_A_Simple_Model_of_the_Implicit_Bid-Ask_Spread_in_an_Efficient_Market","243765986_22_Modeling_market_microstructure_time_series","240094506_Liquidity_and_Execution_Costs_in_Equity_Markets","236861293_Event_Studies_A_Review_of_Issues_and_Methodology","228666580_Theory_and_Practice_of_the_g-Index","228140957_Why_Do_Security_Prices_Change_A_Transaction-Level_Analysis_of_Nyse_Stocks","227799949_Publication_Performance_of_Economists_and_Economics_Departments_in_Turkey_1999-2003","227672207_How_Should_Research_Performance_Be_Measured_A_Study_of_Swedish_Economists","227374945_The_Dealer_and_Market_Concepts_of_Bid-ask_Spread_A_Comparison_for_NASDAQ_Stocks","227357770_An_Updated_Ranking_of_Journals_in_Economics","227249161_Automating_German_Equity_Trading_Bid-Ask_Spreads_on_Competing_Systems","226274647_Ranking_Israel's_Economists","225967569_Price_Volatility_International_Market_Links_and_Their_Implications_for_Regulatory_Policies","222462417_Bid_Ask_and_Transaction_Prices_in_a_Specialist_Market_With_Heterogeneously_Informed_Traders","222455189_Using_Daily_Stock_Returns_The_Case_of_Event_Studies","222444738_A_New_Approach_to_Decomposition_of_Economic_Time_Series_into_Permanent_and_Transitory_Components_with_Particular_Attention_to_Measurement_of_the_Business_Cycle","222397811_Stalking_the_Efficient_Price_in_Market_Microstructure_Specifications_An_Overview","222306919_Dealer_versus_auction_markets_A_paired_comparison_of_execution_costs_on_NASDAQ_and_the_NYSE","220066066_A_Rational_Successive_g-Index_Applied_to_Economics_Departments_in_Ireland","220066056_Comparing_Alternatives_to_the_Web_of_Science_for_Coverage_of_the_Social_Sciences'_Literature","48308339_Using_Daily_Stock_Returns_The_Case_of_Event_Studies","46440323_Price_Volatility_International_Market_Links_and_their_Implications_for_Regulatory_Policies","26387599_Use_of_citation_analysis_to_predict_the_outcome_of_the_2001_Research_Assessment_Exercise_for_Unit_of_Assessment_UoA_61_Library_and_Information_Management","24141796_Peer_Review_vs_Metric-Based_Assessment_Testing_for_Bias_in_the_RAE_Ratings_of_UK_Economics_Departments","24090620_Ranking_European_Economic_Departments_A_Statistical_Approach","24090618_Revealed_Performances_Worldwide_Rankings_of_Economists_and_Economics_Departments_1990-2000","24090617_Where_Are_the_Economists_Who_Publish_Publication_Concentration_and_Rankings_in_Europe_Based_on_Cumulative_Publications"]}
