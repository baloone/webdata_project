{"id":"319770220_Bag_of_Tricks_for_Efficient_Text_Classification","abstract":"This paper proposes a simple and efficient approach for text classification and representation learning. Our experiments show that our fast text classifier fastText is often on par with deep learning classifiers in terms of accuracy, and many orders of magnitude faster for training and evaluation. We can train fastText on more than one billion words in less than ten minutes using a standard multicore CPU, and classify half a million sentences among 312K classes in less than a minute.","authors":["Armand Joulin","Edouard Grave","Piotr Bojanowski","Tomas Mikolov"],"meta":["July 2016"],"references":["265052545_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_Sentence_Classification","3908397_Classes_for_Fast_Maximum_Entropy_Training","2681820_Text_Categorization_with_Support_Vector_Machines_Learning_with_Many_Relevant_Features"]}
