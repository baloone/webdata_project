{"id":"285384275_2epsilon_2_e_-Nonrepetitive_List_Colouring_of_Paths","abstract":"A sequence \\(a_1a_2\\ldots a_p\\) is an r-repetition (for a real number \\(r >1 \\)) if \\(p=\\lceil rq \\rceil \\) for some positive integer q, and \\(a_j=a_{j+q}\\) for \\(j=1,2,\\ldots , p-q\\). In other words, the sequence can be divided into \\(\\lceil r \\rceil \\) blocks where all the blocks are the same, say, all the blocks equal to \\(a_1a_2\\ldots a_q\\) for some \\(q \\ge 1\\), except that when r is not an integer, the last block is the prefix of \\(a_1...a_q\\) of length \\( \\lceil (r - \\lfloor r \\rfloor )q \\rceil \\). A colouring of the vertices of a graph G is r-nonrepetitive if there is no path in G for which the colour sequence of its vertices forms an r-repetition. The r-nonrepetitive chromatic number \\(\\pi _r(G)\\) of G is the minimum number of colours needed in an r-nonrepetitive colouring of G. A k-list assignment of a graph G is a mapping L which assigns a set L(v) of k permissible colours to each vertex v of G. The r-nonrepetitive choice number \\(\\pi _{rch}(G)\\) of G is the least integer k such that for every k-list assignment L, there is an r-nonrepetitive colouring c of G satisfying \\(c(v)\\in L(v)\\) for every vertex v of G. A classical result of Thue asserts that \\(\\pi _2(P_n)\\le 3\\) for all n. It is known that \\( \\pi _{2ch}(P_n) \\le 4\\) for all n. However, it remains an open problem whether \\(\\pi _{2ch}(P_n) \\le 3\\) for all n. This paper proves that for any \\(\\epsilon > 0\\), \\(\\pi _{(2+\\epsilon )ch}(P_n) \\le 3\\) for all n.","authors":["Huanhua Zhao","Xuding Zhu"],"meta":["November 2015Graphs and Combinatorics 32(4)","DOI:10.1007/s00373-015-1652-0"],"references":["266704450_Repetition_Threshold_for_Circular_Words","26532946_Nonrepetitive_Colorings_of_GraphsAA-A_Survey","313062315_Uuer_Unendliche_Zeichenreihen","265441712_Substitution_Dynamical_Systems_-_Spectral_Analysis","229437983_Nonrepetitive_Choice_Number_of_Trees","227786622_Nonrepetitive_Colorings_of_Graphs","225279619_Acyclic_edge-coloring_using_entropy_compression","223146642_On_Dejean's_conjecture_over_large_alphabets","222454554_Proof_of_Dejean's_conjecture_for_alphabets_with_5_6_7_8_9_10_and_11_letters","220569364_Thue_Choosability_of_trees","220345475_Nonrepetitive_List_Colourings_of_Paths","220180484_On_the_Existence_of_Minimal_b-Powers","220155048_The_Thue-Morse_word_contains_circular_power_free_words_of_every_length","220151487_Last_cases_of_Dejean's_conjecture","220077788_Sur_un_Theoreme_de_Thue","29655352_Attainable_lengths_for_circular_binary_words_avoiding_k_powers","2559708_Analytic_Combinatorics"]}
