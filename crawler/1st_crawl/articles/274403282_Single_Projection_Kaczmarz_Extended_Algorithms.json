{"id":"274403282_Single_Projection_Kaczmarz_Extended_Algorithms","abstract":"To find the least squares solution of a very large and inconsistent system of\nequations, one can employ the extended Kaczmarz algorithm. This method\nsimultaneously removes the error term, such that a consistent system is\nasymptotically obtained, and applies Kaczmarz iterations for the current\napproximation of this system. For random corrections of the right hand side and\nKaczmarz updates selected at random, convergence to the least squares solution\nhas been shown. We consider the deterministic control strategies, and show\nconvergence to a least squares solution when row and column updates are chosen\naccording to the almost-cyclic or maximal-residual choice.","authors":["Stefania Petra","Constantin Popa"],"meta":["November 2016Numerical Algorithms 73(3)","DOI:10.1007/s11075-016-0118-7","SourcearXiv"],"references":["313447495_Row-action_methods_for_huge_and_sparse_systems_and_their_applications","274320142_Convergence_Properties_of_the_Randomized_Extended_Gauss--Seidel_and_Kaczmarz_Methods","260146395_The_Mathematics_of_Computerized_Tomography","244497416_Row-Action_Methods_for_Huge_and_Sparse_Systems_and_Their_Applications","243615250_Angenaherte_Auflosung_von_Systemen_Linearer_Gleichungen","239663935_Finding_the_Common_Point_of_Convex_Sets_by_the_Method_of_Successive_Projections","236428765_The_mathematics_of_computerized_tomography_Classics_in_Applied_Mathematics_SIAM_Society_for_Industrial_and_Applied_Mathematics","234787258_Relaxation_methods_for_image_reconstruction","233046746_Least-squares_solution_of_overdetermined_inconsistent_linear_systems_using_Kaczmarz's_relaxation","230700376_Paved_with_Good_Intentions_Analysis_of_a_Randomized_Block_KaczmarzMethod"]}
