{"id":"315459365_Flexible_Learning_in_Computer_Science","abstract":"This paper outlines the concept of Flexible Pedagogy and how it can assist in addressing some of the issues facing STEM disciplines in general, and Computer Science in particular. The paper considers what flexible pedagogy is and how technologies developed by Computer Science can enable flexibility. It then describes some of the issues facing STEM education, with a particular focus on Computer Science education in Higher Education. Finally, it considers how flexible approaches to teaching and learning are particularly pertinent\nto the issues faced in Computer Science and future opportunities.\nhttps://www108.lamp.le.ac.uk/ojs1/index.php/new-directions/article/view/575","authors":["Neil A.
