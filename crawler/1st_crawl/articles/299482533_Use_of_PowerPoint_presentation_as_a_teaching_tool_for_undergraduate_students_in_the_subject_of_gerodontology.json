This study was conducted with the aim to determine the efficacy of a PowerPoint presentation in teaching gerodontology.\n\nMaterials and methods: \nThis is a prospective follow-up study using a pre- and post-intervention assessment. A pilot study was conducted on the final year students to check the feasibility of the study. A convenience sampling procedure was used. All interns (n = 80) of the Modern Dental College and Research Centre, Indore, India were invited to participate. Interns completed a 24-item questionnaire documenting their current knowledge on gerodontology. One week after a 30 min PowerPoint presentation on gerodontology, the same interns completed the same questionnaire again, providing an indication of the efficacy of the learning tool. Paired t-test and McNemar test were employed for statistical analysis.\n\nResults: \nA statistically significant difference was observed in pre- and post-intervention scores (P < 0.05).\n\nConclusion: \nThe results of this study indicated that PowerPoint presentation can be used as an effective tool for improving the knowledge regarding gerodontology.","authors":["dr kamal Shigli","Dr Neha Agrawal","Chandrasekharan Nair","M C Suresh Sajjan"],"meta":["April 2016The Journal of Indian Prosthodontic Society 16(2):187","DOI:10.4103/0972-4052.167940","Project: Dental Education"],"references":["236926121_The_need_for_geriatric_dental_education_in_India_The_geriatric_health_challenges_of_the_millennium","230714112_High_burden_of_dental_caries_in_geriatric_population_of_India_A_systematic_review","284867923_Preventive_and_Social_Medicine","262821225_Effectiveness_of_PowerPoint_Presentations_in_Lectures","229324176_Attitude_of_medical_students_about_different_teaching_aids_used_in_lectures_in_anatomy","225052058_Geriatric_dentistry_-_Meet_the_need","222021202_Students'_perceptions_of_teaching_technologies_application_of_technologies_and_academic_performance","221882222_Indian_Dental_Students'_Preferences_Regarding_Lecture_Courses","215788262_Oral_Health_Education","51743896_Geriatric_restorative_care_-_The_need_the_demand_and_the_challenges"]}
