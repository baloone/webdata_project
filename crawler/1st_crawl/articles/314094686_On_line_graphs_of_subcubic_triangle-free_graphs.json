{"id":"314094686_On_line_graphs_of_subcubic_triangle-free_graphs","abstract":"Line graphs constitute a rich and well-studied class of graphs. In this paper, we focus on three different topics related to line graphs of subcubic triangle-free graphs. First, we show that any such graph $G$ has an independent set of size at least $3|V(G)|/10$, the bound being sharp. As an immediate consequence, we have that any subcubic triangle-free graph $G$, with $n_{i}$ vertices of degree $i$, has a matching of size at least $3n_{1}/20 + 3n_{2}/10 + 9n_{3}/20$. Then we provide several approximate min-max theorems relating cycle-transversals and cycle-packings of line graphs of subcubic triangle-free graphs. This enables us to prove Jones' Conjecture for claw-free graphs with maximum degree $4$. Finally, we concentrate on the computational complexity of \\textsc{Feedback Vertex Set}, \\textsc{Hamiltonian Cycle} and \\textsc{Hamiltonian Path} for subclasses of line graphs of subcubic triangle-free graphs.","authors":["Andrea Munaro"],"meta":["June 2017Discrete Mathematics 340(6):1210-1226","DOI:10.1016/j.disc.2017.01.006"],"references":["274355429_The_independence_number_of_connected_claw_K4-free_4-regular_graphs","269029032_Untersuchungen_zum_Feedback_Vertex_Set_Problem_in_ungerichteten_Graphen","267471716_Feedback_vertex_set_on_planar_graphs","308565955_On_Eulerian_and_Hamiltonian_graphs_and_line-graphs","284672235_Line_graphs_of_bipartite_graphs","279323764_On_cycle_packings_and_feedback_vertex_sets","268839828_Locally_linear_graphs","268617045_On_Hamiltonian_Line-Graphs","268019956_Factors_and_Factorizations_of_Graphs_Proof_Techniques_in_Factor_Theory","266860163_The_independence_number_of_connected_claw_K_4_-free_4-regular_graphs"]}
