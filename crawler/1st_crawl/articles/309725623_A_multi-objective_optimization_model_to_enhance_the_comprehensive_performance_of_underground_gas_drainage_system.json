{"id":"309725623_A_multi-objective_optimization_model_to_enhance_the_comprehensive_performance_of_underground_gas_drainage_system","abstract":"The underground gas drainage system plays a vital role in the underground drilling drainage which is widely used in Chinese coal mines. However, the pure gas drainage flow, gas concentration and energy efficiency, which together represent the comprehensive performance of gas drainage system, are generally low due to the mismatching between the drainage system and drainage objects. The optimization of gas pipeline system has been extensively investigated, but fewer studies consider the diversity and temporal correlation of drainage object characteristics and the multi-objectives of drainage system.","authors":["Xinxin Wang","Fubao Zhou","Tongqiang Xia","Mingjing Xu"],"meta":["November 2016Journal of Natural Gas Science and Engineering 36(24)","DOI:10.1016/j.jngse.2016.11.012"],"references":["276243875_Multi_objective_optimization_of_line_pack_management_of_gas_pipeline_system","257725837_Graph_Theory_and_Its_Application_in_Optimization_of_Gas_Drainage_System_in_Coal_Mine","251515640_Gas_diffusion_behavior_of_coal_and_its_impact_on_production_from_coalbed_methane_reservoirs","222028940_How_sorption-induced_matrix_deformation_affects_gas_flow_in_coal_seams_A_new_FE_model","309725465_Therapeutic_effect_of_acupuncture_plus_comprehensive_rehabilitation_therapy_with_deglutition_disorder_of_the_chronic_stage_caused_by_stroke","297719064_Recent_developments_of_coal_mine_methane_extraction_and_utilization_in_China_A_review","295228102_Local_head_loss_caused_by_valves_in_water_distribution_network","287293509_Synthesis_and_characterization_of_new_micro-mesopore_materials_Beta-KIT-6","285673434_An_integrated_transient_Model_for_simulating_the_Operation_of_Natural_Gas_Transport_Systems","280044419_Retraction_Note_to_Postconditioning_promotes_the_cardiac_repair_through_balancing_collagen_degradation_and_synthesis_after_myocardial_infarction_in_rats_Basic_Research_in_Cardiology_2013_108_318_10100","279898130_Friction-Factor_Equation_Spans_all_Fluid-Flow_Regimes","276078216_A_new_effective_method_and_new_materials_for_high_sealing_performance_of_cross-measure_CMM_drainage_boreholes","273390854_Simulation_of_Coal_Self-Heating_Processes_in_Underground_Methane-rich_Coal_Seams","271998555_Gas_drainage_efficiency_an_input-output_model_for_evaluating_gas_drainage_projects","269286438_A_model_of_safe_drainage_of_coal_seam_gas","267275586_A_fully_coupled_coal_deformation_and_compositional_flow_model_for_the_control_of_the_pre-mining_coal_seam_gas_extraction","264983034_Optimal_operation_of_trunk_natural_gas_pipelines_via_an_inertia-adaptive_particle_swarm_optimization_algorithm","264674638_Optimization_for_design_and_operation_of_natural_gas_transmission_networks","264386890_Effect_of_bedding_structural_diversity_of_coal_on_permeability_evolution_and_gas_disasters_control_with_coal_mining","263160031_Study_on_the_coexistence_of_gas_and_coal_spontaneous_combustion_I_Disaster_mechanism","259937800_The_Mathematical_Theory_of_Non-Uniform_Gases_An_Account_of_the_Kinetic_Theory_of_Viscosity_Thermal_Conduction_and_Diffusion_in_Gases","259512412_Optimal_design_of_a_natural_gas_transmission_network_layout","257773013_Power_optimization_of_gas_pipelines_via_an_improved_particle_swarm_optimization_algorithm","247839344_The_Dispersion_of_Matter_in_Turbulent_Flow_Through_Pipes","241269439_The_BOBYQA_Algorithm_for_Bound_Constrained_Optimization_without_Derivatives","241080645_Coal_mine_methane_A_review_of_capture_and_utilization_practices_with_benefits_to_mining_safety_and_to_greenhouse_gas_reduction","229060745_Diffusion_Mass_Transfer_in_Fluid_System","222993030_Optimization_of_natural_gas_pipeline_transportation_using_ant_colony_optimization","3825692_An_integrated_expert_systemoperations_research_approach_for_natural_gas_pipeline_operations_optimization"]}
