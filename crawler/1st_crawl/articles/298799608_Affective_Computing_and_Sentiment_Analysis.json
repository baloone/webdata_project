{"id":"298799608_Affective_Computing_and_Sentiment_Analysis","abstract":"Understanding emotions is an important aspect of personal development and growth, and as such it is a key tile for the emulation of human intelligence. Besides being important for the advancement of AI, emotion processing is also important for the closely related task of polarity detection. The opportunity to automatically capture the general public's sentiments about social events, political movements, marketing campaigns, and product preferences has raised interest in both the scientific community, for the exciting open challenges, and the business world, for the remarkable fallouts in marketing and financial market prediction. This has led to the emerging fields of affective computing and sentiment analysis, which leverage human-computer interaction, information retrieval, and multimodal signal processing for distilling people's sentiments from the ever-growing amount of online social data.","authors":["Erik Cambria"],"meta":["March 2016Intelligent Systems, IEEE 31(2):102-107","DOI:10.1109/MIS.2016.31"],"references":["282671979_Sentiment_Data_Flow_Analysis_by_Means_of_Dynamic_Linguistic_Patterns","281050362_A_Fuzzy_System_for_Concept-Level_Sentiment_Analysis","273635373_The_CLSA_Model_A_Novel_Framework_for_Concept-Level_Sentiment_Analysis","268813106_SenticNet_3_A_Common_and_Common-Sense_Knowledge_Base_for_Cognition-Driven_Sentiment_Analysis","265972804_Sentilo_Frame-Based_Sentiment_Analysis","262768192_Meta-Level_Sentiment_Models_for_Big_Social_Data_Analysis","261959618_iFeel_a_system_that_compares_and_combines_sentiment_analysis_methods","254746105_WordNet-Affect_an_Affective_Extension_of_WordNet","221654582_Mining_and_summarizing_customer_reviews","221571403_Affective_multimodal_human-computer_interaction","221101540_Discourse_Level_Opinion_Interpretation","221012755_Multimodal_Subjectivity_Analysis_of_Multiparty_Conversation","220395370_Affect_Detection_An_Interdisciplinary_Review_of_Models_Methods_and_Their_Applications","200044289_SentiWordNet_A_Publicly_Available_Lexical_Resource_for_Opinion_Mining","23493444_A_Survey_of_Affect_Recognition_Methods_Audio_Visual_and_Spontaneous_Expressions","317599228_Emotion_Recognition_A_Pattern_Analysis_Approach","305622270_Sentiment_Analysis_and_Opinion_Mining","305386599_Domain_adaptation_for_large-scale_sentiment_classification_A_deep_learning_approach","303484696_Fusing_audio_visual_and_textual_clues_for_sentiment_analysis_from_multimodal_content","285729817_Sentiment_Analysis_and_Opinion_Mining","284039049_Recursive_deep_models_for_semantic_compositionality_over_a_sentiment_treebank","282517768_Fusing_audio_visual_and_textual_clues_for_sentiment_analysis_from_multimodal_content","281428402_The_Cognitive_Structure_of_Emotions","280734667_Sentic_Computing_A_Common-Sense-Based_Framework_for_Concept-Level_Sentiment_Analysis","277291483_WordNet-Affect_an_Affective_Extension_of_WordNet","271948617_Word_Polarity_Disambiguation_Using_Bayesian_Model_and_Opinion-Level_Features","262806780_An_empirical_study_of_sentence_features_for_subjectivity_and_polarity_classification","262333296_The_Hourglass_of_Emotions","261567318_Jumping_NLP_Curves_A_Review_of_Natural_Language_Processing_Research_Review_Article","260720987_A_Probabilistic_Generative_Model_for_Mining_Cybercriminal_Networks_from_Online_Social_Media","260305031_New_Avenues_in_Opinion_Mining_and_Sentiment_Analysis","257093268_Categorical_and_dimensional_affect_analysis_in_continuous_input_Current_trends_and_future_directions","247865898_The_Emotion_Machine_Commonsense_Thinking","222650661_Recognising_realistic_emotions_and_affect_in_speech_State_of_the_art_and_lessons_learnt_from_the_first_challenge","221052273_Towards_Multimodal_Sentiment_Analysis_Harvesting_Opinions_from_the_Web","220946963_Semi-Supervised_Polarity_Lexicon_Induction","215470793_Annotating_Expressions_of_Opinions_and_Emotions_in_Language","215470760_Opinion_Mining_and_Sentiment_Analysis","200044329_Recognizing_Contextual_Polarity_in_Phrase-Level_Sentiment_Analysis","5666367_Characterization_of_the_Affective_Norms_for_English_Words_by_discrete_emotional_categories","2518534_Thumbs_up_Sentiment_Classification_Using_Machine_Learning_Techniques"]}
