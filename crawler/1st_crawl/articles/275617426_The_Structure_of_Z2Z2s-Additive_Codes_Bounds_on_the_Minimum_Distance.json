{"id":"275617426_The_Structure_of_Z2Z2s-Additive_Codes_Bounds_on_the_Minimum_Distance","abstract":"ℤ2ℤ4-additive codes, as a special class of abelian codes, have found a very welcoming place in the recent studies of algebraic coding theory. This family in one hand is similar to binary codes on the other hand is similar to quaternary codes. The structure of ℤ2ℤ4- additive codes and their duals has been determined lately. In this study we investigate the algebraic structure of ℤ2ℤ2s -additive codes which are a natural generalization of ℤ2ℤ4-additive codes. We present the standard form of the generator and parity-check matrices of the ℤ2ℤ2s -additive codes. Also, we give two bounds on the minimum distance of ℤ2ℤ2s -additive codes and compare them.","authors":["Ismail Aydogdu","Irfan Siap"],"meta":["November 2013Applied Mathematics & Information Sciences 7(6):2271-2278","DOI:10.12785/amis/070617"],"references":["257554670_Z2Z4_-linear_codes_Generator_matrices_and_duality","242796716_Zsub_2k-linear_codes","241438519_The_Z_4_Linearity_of_Kerdock_Preparata_Goethals_and_Related_Codes","228566775_Optimal_codes_over_Z2_ch_Z4","226123780_Modular_and_p-adic_cyclic_codes","313573945_Maximum_distance_q-nary_codes","265356186_An_algebraic_approach_to_association_schemes_and_coding_theory","220685724_Association_Schemes_and_Coding_Theory","3080816_Maximum_distance_-nary_codes","3080308_Maximum_distance_codes_over_rings_of_order_4"]}
