{"id":"260604849_How_Unsplittable-Flow-Covering_Helps_Scheduling_with_Job-Dependent_Cost_Functions","abstract":"Generalizing many well-known and natural scheduling problems, scheduling with\njob-specific cost functions has gained a lot of attention recently. In this\nsetting, each job incurs a cost depending on its completion time, given by a\nprivate cost function, and one seeks to schedule the jobs to minimize the total\nsum of these costs. The framework captures many important scheduling objectives\nsuch as weighted flow time or weighted tardiness. Still, the general case as\nwell as the mentioned special cases are far from being very well understood\nyet, even for only one machine. Aiming for better general understanding of this\nproblem, in this paper we focus on the case of uniform job release dates on one\nmachine for which the state of the art is a 4-approximation algorithm. This is\ntrue even for a special case that is equivalent to the covering version of the\nwell-studied and prominent unsplittable flow on a path problem, which is\ninteresting in its own right. For that covering problem, we present a\nquasi-polynomial time $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm that yields an\n$(e+\\epsilon)$-approximation for the above scheduling problem. Moreover, for\nthe latter we devise the best possible resource augmentation result regarding\nspeed: a polynomial time algorithm which computes a solution with \\emph{optimal\n}cost at $1+\\epsilon$ speedup. Finally, we present an elegant QPTAS for the\nspecial case where the cost functions of the jobs fall into at most $\\log n$\nmany classes. This algorithm allows the jobs even to have up to $\\log n$ many\ndistinct release dates.","authors":["Wiebke Höhn","Julián Mestre","Andreas Wiese"],"meta":["March 2014","DOI:10.1007/978-3-662-43948-7_52","SourcearXiv","Conference: International Colloquium on Automata, Languages, and Programming"],"references":["262403418_Dual_Techniques_for_Scheduling_on_a_Machine_with_Varying_Speed","260482869_A_4-approximation_for_scheduling_on_a_single_machine_with_general_cost_function","233391168_A_Mazing_2_Approximation_for_Unsplittable_Flow_on_a_Path","220779606_A_Logarithmic_Approximation_for_Unsplittable_Flow_on_Line_Graphs","220770695_Resource_Allocation_for_Covering_Time_Varying_Demands","220588770_Approximation_algorithm_for_the_generalized_assignment_problem","220533108_On_the_Equivalence_between_the_Primal-Dual_Schema_and_the_Local_Ratio_Technique","2532905_Strengthening_Integrality_Gaps_for_Capacitated_Network_Design_and_Covering_Problems","2402197_Approximation_Schemes_for_Minimizing_Average_Weighted_Completion_Time_with_Release_Dates","2382648_A_Unified_Approach_to_Approximating_Resource_Allocation_and_Scheduling","314794502_Approximation_schemes_for_preemptive_weighted_flow_time","267080486_Approximating_the_Configuration-LP_for_Minimizing_Weighted_Sum_of_Completion_Times_on_Unrelated_Machines","262169759_Weighted_Geometric_Set_Multi-cover_via_Quasi-uniform_Sampling","232385101_A_Pseudopolynomial_Algorithm_for_Sequencing_Jobs_to_Minimize_Total_Tardiness","228057587_Approximation_Schemes_for_Minimizing_Average_Weighted_Completion_Time_with_Release_Dates","225236526_Approximation_Algorithms_for_the_Unsplittable_Flow_Problem","225172108_Approximation_Algorithms_for_the_Unsplittable_Flow_Problem","221591484_Algorithms_for_Minimizing_Weighted_Flow_Time","221590401_A_quasi-PTAS_for_unsplittable_flow_on_line_graphs","221462742_A_Primal-Dual_Approximation_Algorithm_for_Min-Sum_Single-Machine_Scheduling_Problems","220780214_Minimizing_weighted_flow_time","220390598_Minimizing_weighted_flow_time","220390466_Multicommodity_demand_flow_in_a_tree_and_packing_integer_programs","48209334_A_Constant_Factor_Approximation_Algorithm_for_Unsplittable_Flow_on_Paths","46581799_The_Geometry_of_Scheduling","2854769_Approximation_Schemes_for_Preemptive_Weighted_Flow_Time","2456737_Searching_in_an_Unknown_Environment_An_Optimal_Randomized_Algorithm_for_the_Cow-Path_Problem"]}
