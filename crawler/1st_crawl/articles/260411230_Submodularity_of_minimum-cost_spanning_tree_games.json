{"id":"260411230_Submodularity_of_minimum-cost_spanning_tree_games","abstract":"We give a necessary condition and a sufficient condition for a minimum-cost spanning tree game introduced by Bird to be submodular (or convex). When the cost is restricted to two values, we give a characterization of submodular minimum-cost spanning tree games. We also discuss algorithmic issues.Copyright Â© 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
