{"id":"323747250_Approximate_Quantum_Fourier_Transform_with_On_logn_T_gates","abstract":"The ability to implement the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) efficiently on a quantum computer enables the advantages offered by a variety of fundamental quantum algorithms, such as those for integer factoring, computing discrete logarithm over Abelian groups, and phase estimation. The standard fault-tolerant implementation of an $n$-qubit QFT approximates the desired transformation by removing small-angle controlled rotations and synthesizing the remaining ones into Clifford+T gates, incurring the T-count complexity of $O(n \\log^2(n))$. In this paper we show how to obtain approximate QFT with the T-count of $O(n \\log(n))$. Our approach relies on quantum circuits with measurements and feedforward, and on reusing a special quantum state that induces the phase gradient transformation. We report asymptotic analysis as well as concrete circuits, demonstrating significant advantages in both theory and practice.","authors":["Yunseong Nam","Yuan Su","Dmitri Maslov"],"meta":["March 2018npj Quantum Information 6(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41534-020-0257-5"],"references":["320564691_Automated_optimization_of_large_quantum_circuits_with_continuous_parameters","319952718_Halving_the_cost_of_quantum_addition","318584255_Use_of_global_interactions_in_efficient_quantum_circuit_constructions","282437975_Analytical_formulas_for_the_performance_scaling_of_quantum_processors_with_a_large_number_of_defective_gates","268689471_Quantum_arithmetic_with_the_Quantum_Fourier_Transform","262955739_Efficient_Synthesis_of_Universal_Repeat-Until-Success_Circuits","261833103_Efficient_Synthesis_of_Universal_Repeat-Until-Success_Quantum_Circuits","280821144_Polynomial-Time_Algorithms_for_Prime_Factorization_and_Discrete_Logarithms_on_a_Quantum_Computer","277565777_Resource_requirements_for_a_fault-tolerant_quantum_Fourier_transform","275431758_Quantum_cryptographic_algorithm_for_color_images_using_quantum_Fourier_transform_and_double_random-phase_encoding"]}
