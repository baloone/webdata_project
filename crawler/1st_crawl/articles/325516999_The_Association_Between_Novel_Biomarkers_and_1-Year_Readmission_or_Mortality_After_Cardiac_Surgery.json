{"id":"325516999_The_Association_Between_Novel_Biomarkers_and_1-Year_Readmission_or_Mortality_After_Cardiac_Surgery","abstract":"Background: \nNovel cardiac biomarkers including sST2, Galectin-3 and NT-proBNP may be associated with long-term adverse outcomes following cardiac surgery. We sought to measure the association between cardiac biomarker levels and 1-year hospital readmission or mortality.\n\nMethods: \nPlasma biomarkers from 1,047 patients discharged alive after isolated CABG surgery from eight medical centers were measured in a cohort from the NNE Cardiovascular Disease Study Group between 2004 and 2007. We evaluated the association between preoperative and postoperative biomarkers and 1-year readmission or mortality using Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox's Proportional Hazards modeling, adjusting for covariates used in the STS 30-day readmission model.\n\nResults: \nThe median follow-up time was 365 days. After adjustment for established risk factors, above median levels of postoperative Galectin-3 and NT-proBNP were each significantly associated with 1-year readmission or mortality: Galectin-3 (median = 10.35 ng/mL, HR: 1.40, 95% CI: 1.08-1.80, p=0.010); NT-proBNP (median = 15.21 ng/mL, HR: 1.42, 95% CI: 1.07-1.87, p=0.014).\n\nConclusions: \nIn patients undergoing cardiac surgery, novel cardiac biomarkers were associated with readmission or mortality independent of established risk factors. Measurement of these biomarkers may improve our ability to identify patients at highest risk for readmission or mortality prior to discharge. This will also allow resource allocation accordingly, while implementing strategies for personalized medicine based on the biomarker profile of the patient.","authors":["Jeffrey Phillip Jacobs","Shama Alam","Sherry L.
