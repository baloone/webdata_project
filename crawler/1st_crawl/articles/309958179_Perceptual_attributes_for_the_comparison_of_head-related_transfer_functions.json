{"id":"309958179_Perceptual_attributes_for_the_comparison_of_head-related_transfer_functions","abstract":"The benefit of using individual head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) in binaural audio is well documented with regards to improving localization precision. However, with the increased use of binaural audio in more complex scene renderings, cognitive studies, and virtual and augmented reality simulations, the perceptual impact of HRTF selection may go beyond simple localization. In this study, the authors develop a list of attributes which qualify the perceived differences between HRTFs, providing a qualitative understanding of the perceptual variance of non-individual binaural renderings. The list of attributes was designed using a Consensus Vocabulary Protocol elicitation method. Participants followed an Individual Vocabulary Protocol elicitation procedure, describing the perceived differences between binaural stimuli based on binauralized extracts of multichannel productions. This was followed by an automated lexical reduction and a series of consensus group meetings during which participants agreed on a list of relevant attributes. Finally, the proposed list of attributes was then evaluated through a listening test, leading to eight valid perceptual attributes for describing the perceptual dimensions affected by HRTF set variations.","authors":["Laurent Simon","Nick Zacharov","Brian F G Katz"],"meta":["November 2016The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America 140(5):3623-3632","DOI:10.1121/1.4966115","Project: BiLi Binaural Listening"],"references":["298879947_Direct_comparison_of_the_impact_of_head_tracking_reverberation_and_individualized_head-related_transfer_functions_on_the_spatial_perception_of_a_virtual_speech_source","279961699_Numerical_calculation_of_listener-specific_head-related_transfer_functions_and_sound_localization_Microphone_model_and_mesh_discretization","266444693_Efficient_HRTF_synthesis_using_an_interaural_transfer_function_model","265735462_Reaching_nearby_sources_Comparison_between_real_and_virtual_sound_and_visual_targets","264440259_Modeling_Sound-Source_Localization_in_Sagittal_Planes_for_Human_Listeners","263008227_Localization_of_Amplitude-Panned_Virtual_Sources_Part_1_Stereophonic_Panning","262069174_BeaqleJS_HTML5_and_JavaScript_based_Framework_for_the_Subjective_Evaluation_of_Audio_Quality","261614050_Unraveling_the_perception_of_spatial_sound_reproduction_Language_development_verbal_protocol_analysis_and_listener_training","261361870_Identification_and_selection_of_the_descriptors_for_establishing_a_sensory_profile_of_tomato_by_a_multidimensional_approach","259520850_Exploration_of_architectural_spaces_by_the_blind_using_virtual_auditory_reality_for_the_construction_of_spatial_knowledge","242268442_Multidimensional_Perceptual_Unfolding_of_Spatially_Processed_Speech_I_Deriving_Stimulus_Space_Using_INDSCAL","235613453_Looking_for_a_Relevant_Similarity_Criterion_for_HRTF_Clustering_A_Comparative_Study","233403040_Disentangling_preference_ratings_of_concert_hall_acoustics_using_subjective_sensory_profiles","228347731_Ecological_Validity_of_soundscape_reproduction","221849640_Perceptually_based_head-related_transfer_function_database_optimization","44676345_Structural_properties_of_spatial_representations_in_blind_people_Scanning_images_constructed_from_haptic_exploration_or_from_locomotion_in_a_3-D_audio_virtual_environment","14844055_Localization_using_nonindividualized_head-related_transfer_functions","2726006_Objective_and_Subjective_Evaluation_of_Head-Related_Transfer_Function_Filter_Design","317590527_Analyzing_Sensory_Data_with_R","313640695_Sensory_evaluation_by_quantitative_description_analysis","300755509_Head-Related_Transfer_Functions_and_Virtual_Auditory_Display","298718854_Subjective_HRTF_evaluations_for_obtaining_global_similarity_metrics_of_assessors_and_assessees","289624518_Evaluation_of_spatial_enhancement_systems_for_stereo_headphone_reproduction_by_preference_and_attribute_rating","289044318_Head-Related_Transfer_Function_customization_by_frequency_scaling_and_rotation_shift_based_on_a_new_morphological_matching_method","283762696_The_development_of_a_sound_wheel_for_reproduced_sound","281994373_Sensory_Evaluation_of_Food","281217504_Families_of_sound_attributes_for_assessment_of_spatial_audio","272385687_Inter-Laboratory_Round_Robin_HRTF_Measurement_Comparison","271153753_Efficient_Individualization_Method_of_HRTFs_Using_Critical-band_Based_Spectral_Cue_Control","266047400_Sensory_Evaluation_of_Food_Principles_and_Practice","265413992_scshape_listen_hrtf_database","264938504_A_spatial_audio_quality_inventory_SAQI","263712073_Personalization_of_head-related_transfer_functions_in_the_median_plane_based_on_the_anthropometry_of_the_listener's_pinnae","262966187_Developing_Lexicons_A_Review","246459559_Individual_Vocabulary_Profiling_of_Spatial_Enhancement_Systems_for_Stereo_Headphone_Reproduction","229932830_Sensory_Evaluation_By_Quantitative_Descriptive_Analysis","229789739_Flavor_Profile-A_New_Approach_to_Flavor_Problems","224034887_Rapid_head-related_transfer_function_adaptation_using_virtual_auditory_environment","222362833_Sensory_mapping_using_Flash_profile_Comparison_with_a_conventional_descriptive_method_for_the_evaluation_of_the_flavour_of_fruit_dairy_products","49301663_The_Psychology_of_Personal_Constructs","31842758_Sensory_Analysis_Identification_and_Selection_of_Descriptors_for_Establishing_a_Sensory_Profile_by_a_Multidimensional_Approach_Analyse_sensorielle_-_Recherche_et_selection_de_descripteurs_pour_l'elabo","30930225_Identification_of_Perceived_Spatial_Attributes_of_Recordings_by_Repertory_Grid_Technique_and_Other_Methods","21591928_A_model_of_head-related_transfer_functions_based_on_principal_components_analysis_and_minimum-phase_reconstruction","6507158_Evaluation_of_multichannel_reproduced_sound_Scaling_auditory_attributes_underlying_listener_preferenc"]}
