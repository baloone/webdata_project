{"id":"239061107_Classification_of_radar_returns_from_the_ionosphere_using_neural_networks","abstract":"In ionospheric research, we must classify radar returns from the ionosphere as either suitable for further analysis or not. This time-consuming task has typically required human intervention. We tested several different feedforward neural networks to investigate the effects of network type (single-layer versus multilayer) and number of hidden nodes upon performance. As expected, the multilayer feedforward networks (MLFN'S) outperformed the single-layer networks, achieving 100% accuracy on the training set and up to 98% accuracy on the testing set. Comparable figures for the single-layer networks were 94.5% and 92%, respectively. When measures of sensitivity, specificity, and proportion of variance accounted for by the model are considered, the superiority of the MLFN's over the single-layer networks is even more striking.","authors":["Vincent G.
