{"id":"248250633_Prediction_of_tensile_yield_strength_of_rigid_inorganic_particulate_filled_thermoplastic_composites","abstract":"Advances in the study of the tensile yield strength of rigid inorganic particulate filled thermoplastic composites have been reviewed and brief comments on the existing expressions for predicting it have been made in the present paper. The main factors affecting the yield strength of such composites are: (i)the interfacial adhesion between the fillers and the matrix; (ii)the shape, size and its distribution of the fillers; (iii)the dispersion of the particles in the matrix. For factor (i), this depends on a large extent upon the properties of the matrix materials and the surface pre-treatment (or modification) of the inclusions. There have been relatively few theoretical descriptions of the tensile yield-strength behaviour for rigid particulate-filled composites with interfacial adhesion lying between poor and good.","authors":["J.
