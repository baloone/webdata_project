{"id":"321243146_Topological_Credibility_Analysis_of_Digital_Images-A_Locally_Finite_Spaces_Approach","abstract":"This article is a self-evident theory of Topological Space (TS) that are Locally Finite (LF) and the Digital Imagery (DI) through Digital Topology (DT). LF Spaces (LFS) has the advantage of computer representation. New DT axioms are suggested here deriving basic topological ideas investigating properties of LFS and bridging classical topology and computer science. In addition to the foundations, effectual algorithms solving geometrical and topological problems can be achieved using any programming languages facilitating their practical employment. ALFS based new tactic independent of Euclidean Geometry (EG) to Digital Geometry (DG). This is an anthology of the basic research and results in DT, DG and DI leading to new computer based solutions of everyday problems especially in analysis of technical and medical images.","authors":["U S Ajiethkumar","Kalidass Kaliappan","Bhuvaneswari Kandaswamy"],"meta":["January 2017International Journal of Pure and Applied Mathematics 116(23):707-717","Project: Topological Credibility Analysis of Digital Images"],"references":["320549250_Congestion_control_scheme_for_heterogeneous_wireless_ad_hoc_networks_using_self-adjust_hybrid_model","320549210_Annoyed_realm_outlook_taxonomy_using_twin_transfer_learning","318235185_Path_Observation_Based_Physical_Routing_Protocol_for_Wireless_Ad_Hoc_Networks","309486597_Hop-by-hop_Channel_-Alert_Routing_to_Congestion_Control_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","282987919_GCC_over_heterogeneous_wireless_ad_hoc_networks","315721070_Consistently_neighbor_detection_for_MANET","289824355_A_New_Concept_for_Digital_Geometry","238680661_Classical_Topology_Combinatorial_Group_Theory","222471223_Finite_Topology_and_Image_Analysis"]}
