This is a specialized branch of Computer Science (CS). Machine learning (ML) is closely related to AI. It allows a machine to read on its own without human interaction. Basically, in machine learning, there are special algorithms that can obtain data, process data (Mainly using statistically accepted methods) and predict the output at an acceptable distance.","authors":["Pooja Vinayakrao Ambatkar"],"meta":["November 2016","DOI:10.17605/OSF.IO/KQJP5","Project: MACHINE LEARNING AND ITS USES IN DIFFERENT ASPECTS"],"references":["343179789_THE_EMERGING_ROLE_OF_ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE_IN_MODERN_SOCIETY","346471791_ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE_AND_HUMANIST_CHALLENGES","288264707_From_theories_to_queries_Active_learning_in_practice"]}
