{"id":"351526502_Students'_Characteristics_Influence_Readiness_to_Use_Mobile_Technology_in_Higher_Education","abstract":"The purpose of the current study was to explore students' characteristics that influence student's readiness to use mobile technology at An-Najah National University in Palestine. The researchers used a quantitative approach to achieve the purpose of the study. 214 students from different schools were participated in the study. A descriptive and one-way ANOVA to test the hypotheses were used in data analysis stage. The findings of the study revealed that the availability of technology is an important factor to use mobile technology in higher education, as well as the student's capability to use mobile technology for her study. Furthermore, student's attitudes towards mobile technology integration plays crucial role in student's readiness to use it. Higher education institutions could benefit from the findings of the study through designing capacity building programs for students to encourage them to use the mobile services inside and off campus. The limitations of the study were depending only on one tool for data collection from one university which could raise doubt about generalizing the findings to another context.","authors":["Ali Zuhdi Shaqour","Soheil Salha","Zuheir N Khlaif"],"meta":["May 2021Education in the Knowledge Society (EKS) 22:e23915","DOI:10.14201/eks.23915"],"references":["342396732_The_Unanticipated_Educational_Challenges_of_Developing_Countries_in_Covid-19_Crisis_A_Brief_Report","341358623_Designing_Quality_E-Learning_Environments_for_Emergency_Remote_Teaching_in_Coronavirus_Crisis","337481367_PALESTINIAN_PERSPECTIVE_IN_DIGITALIZATION_OF_TEACHER_PROFESSIONAL_DEVELOPMENT_TPD","336104746_Living_under_occupation_Palestinian_teachers'_experiences_and_their_digital_responses","334069454_Undergraduate_mobile_phone_use_in_the_Caribbean_Implications_for_teaching_and_learning_in_an_academic_setting","327367706_Exploring_the_impact_of_self-management_of_learning_and_personal_learning_initiative_on_mobile_language_learning_A_moderated_mediation_model","323782132_A_critical_review_of_mobile_learning_integration_in_formal_educational_contexts","342172333_Medical_students'_attitudes_and_perceptions_towards_the_effectiveness_of_mobile_learning_A_comparative_information-need_perspective","326926643_Factors_influencing_preservice_teachers'_intention_to_use_technology_TPACK_teacher_self-efficacy_and_technology_acceptance_model","324763031_The_use_of_mobile_learning_in_higher_education_A_systematic_review"]}
