{"id":"221372887_Multiobjective_optimization_with_an_asymptotically_uniform_coverage_of_Pareto_front","abstract":"This paper suggests an enhancement of an existing method for the multiobjective optimization known as GAM (goal attainment method). In our proposal, the GAM algorithm is combined with a mechanism that automatically provides a set of parameters (weights, coordinates of the reference point) for which the method generates noninferior solutions uniformly spread over a suitably selected part of the Pareto front. The resulting set of solutions is then presented in a suitable graphic form so that the solution representing the most satisfactory tradeoff can be easily chosen. The whole algorithm was implemented as a program and tested on several RF design examples (video, low-noise, and power amplifiers), whose optimization results are also presented. For a comparison, the first design example was also solved by another method known as WMM (weighted metrics method).","authors":["Jan MÃ­chal","J.
