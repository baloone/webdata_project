{"id":"322287139_On_the_logical_formalization_of_possibilistic_counterparts_of_states_over_n-valued_Lukasiewicz_events","abstract":"Possibility and necessity measures are commonly defined over Boolean algebras. This work considers a generalization of these kinds of measures over MV-algebras as a possibilistic counterpart of the (probabilistic) notion of state on MV-algebras. Two classes of possibilistic states over MV-algebras of functions are characterized in terms of (generalized) Sugeno integrals. For reasoning about these representable classes of possibilistic states, we introduce many-valued modal logics based on the Rational Łukasiewicz Logic, that are shown to be complete with respect to corresponding classes of Kripke models equipped with those states. © The Author, 2009.
