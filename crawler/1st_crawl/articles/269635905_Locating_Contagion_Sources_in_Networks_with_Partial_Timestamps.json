{"id":"269635905_Locating_Contagion_Sources_in_Networks_with_Partial_Timestamps","abstract":"This paper studies the problem of identifying the contagion source when\npartial timestamps of a contagion process are available. We formulate the\nsource localization problem as a ranking problem on graphs, where infected\nnodes are ranked according to their likelihood of being the source. Two ranking\nalgorithms, cost-based ranking (CR) and tree-based ranking (TR), are proposed\nin this paper. Experimental evaluations with synthetic and real-world data show\nthat our algorithms significantly improve the ranking accuracy compared with\nfour existing algorithms.","authors":["Kai Zhu","Zhen Chen","Lei Ying"],"meta":["September 2016Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery 30(5)","DOI:10.1007/s10618-015-0435-9","SourcearXiv"],"references":["261337234_Rumor_source_detection_under_probabilistic_sampling","291325189_The_cholera_near_Golden_Square_and_at_Deptford","271554341_Estimating_infection_sources_in_a_network_with_incomplete_observations","271554252_Network_observability_and_localization_of_the_source_of_diffusion_based_on_a_subset_of_nodes","269074218_Detecting_Multiple_Information_Sources_in_Networks_Under_the_SIR_Model","266657082_Rumor_source_detection_with_multiple_observations_fundamental_limits_and_algorithms","262154530_Seeking_provenance_of_information_using_social_media","261273055_Sources_of_misinformation_in_Online_Social_Networks_Who_to_suspect","261049031_Spotting_Culprits_in_Epidemics_How_Many_and_Which_Ones","260971865_A_fast_Monte_Carlo_algorithm_for_source_localization_on_graphs","260062220_Inferring_the_origin_of_an_epidemic_with_dynamic_message-passing_algorithm","256762265_A_Robust_Information_Source_Estimator_with_Sparse_Observations","256662908_How_to_Identify_an_Infection_Source_With_Limited_Observations","256606270_Finding_an_infection_source_under_the_SIS_model","254464234_Rise_and_fall_patterns_of_information_diffusion_Model_and_implications"]}
