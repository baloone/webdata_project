{"id":"334839965_Fasting_Blood_Glucose_Predicts_Incidence_of_Hypertension_Independent_of_HbA1c_Levels_and_Insulin_Resistance_in_Middle-Aged_Japanese_The_Saku_Study","abstract":"Background: \nRelationships between blood glucose (BG) levels and insulin action, and incidence of hypertension has not been well known epidemiologically. This study aimed to investigate the association between indices of diabetes and the incidence of hypertension and compare the predictive powers of these indices in middle-aged Japanese.\n\nMethods: \nThis 5-year cohort study included 2210 Japanese aged 30-64 years without hypertension. Hazard ratios of high fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels, high post-loaded BG levels, high glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, insulin resistance (defined by homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance [HOMA-IR]) and impaired insulin secretion at baseline for the incidence of hypertension were estimated using multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazard models. Hypertension was defined as blood pressure ≥140/90 mmHg or receiving antihypertensive treatment.\n\nResults: \nDuring the follow-up, 456 participants developed hypertension. After adjustment for HbA1c and HOMA-IR, FBG was independently and significantly associated with hypertension. The hazard ratio of participants with FBG ≥7.0 mmol/l was 1.79 compared with those with FBG <5.6 mmol/l. Even among those with HbA1c <6.5%, HOMA-IR <2.5, body mass index <25 kg/m2, age <55 years old, blood pressure <130/80 mmHg or non- and moderate drinking, the results were similar. High 120-min BG level and impaired insulin secretion did not increase the risk for hypertension.\n\nConclusions: \nFBG was a predictable index for future incidence of hypertension in middle-aged Japanese men and women. This is the first study comparing predictive powers of indices of diabetes for the incidence of hypertension.","authors":["Yukako Tatsumi","Akiko Morimoto","Kei Asayama","Sonoda Nao"],"meta":["August 2019American Journal of Hypertension 32(12)","DOI:10.1093/ajh/hpz123"],"references":["324036380_Japanese_Clinical_Practice_Guideline_for_Diabetes_2016","321047308_2017_ACCAHAAAPAABCACPMAGSAPhAASHASPCNMAPCNA_Guideline_for_the_Prevention_Detection_Evaluation_and_Management_of_High_Blood_Pressure_in_Adults_A_Report_of_the_American_College_of_CardiologyAmerican_Hea","315846087_Mechanism_of_the_blood_pressure-lowering_effect_of_sodium-glucose_cotransporter_2_inhibitors_in_obese_patients_with_type_2_diabetes","261030428_Metabolically_healthy_obesity_and_risk_of_incident_type_2_diabetes_A_meta-analysis_of_prospective_cohort_studies","257802051_International_clinical_harmonization_of_glycated_hemoglobin_in_Japan_From_Japan_Diabetes_Society_to_National_Glycohemoglobin_Standardization_Program_values","236915425_Impact_of_impaired_insulin_secretion_and_insulin_resistance_on_the_incidence_of_type_2_diabetes_mellitus_in_a_Japanese_population_The_Saku_study","221724679_Glycated_Hemoglobin_and_Risk_of_Hypertension_in_the_Atherosclerosis_Risk_in_Communities_Study","47509707_Glucose_Insulin_and_Incident_Hypertension_in_the_Multi-Ethnic_Study_of_Atherosclerosis","38054072_Alcohol_as_a_Risk_Factor_for_Type_2_Diabetes_A_systematic_review_and_meta-analysis","12964670_Impaired_fasting_glucose_and_the_risk_of_hypertension_in_Japanese_men_between_the_1980s_and_the_1990s_-_The_Osaka_Health_Survey","6662798_Risk_factors_for_chronic_kidney_disease_in_a_community-based_population_A_10-year_follow-up_study","5864501_Joint_effects_of_history_of_hypertension_at_baseline_and_type_2_diabetes_at_baseline_and_during_follow-up_on_the_risk_of_coronary_heart_disease","5802325_Two-hour_glucose_predicts_the_development_of_hypertension_over_5_years_The_AusDiab_study","330603691_A_Prospective_Study_of_Health_Check_Examinees_for_the_Development_of_Non-insulin-dependent_Diabetes_Mellitus_Relationship_of_the_Incidence_of_Diabetes_with_the_Initial_Insulinogenic_Index_and_Degree_o","327115608_Fasting_blood_glucose_is_predictive_of_hypertension_in_a_general_Japanese_population","324037820_Japanese_Clinical_Practice_Guideline_for_Diabetes_2016","323916204_Hypertension_with_diabetes_mellitus_physiology_and_pathology","322109242_A_prospective_study_of_the_impact_of_diabetes_mellitus_on_restrictive_and_obstructive_lung_function_impairment_The_Saku_study","321044966_2017_ACCAHAAAPAABCACPMAGSAPhAASHASPCNMAPCNA_Guideline_for_the_Prevention_Detection_Evaluation_and_Management_of_High_Blood_Pressure_in_Adults","320686662_Association_between_alcohol_consumption_and_incidence_of_impaired_insulin_secretion_and_insulin_resistance_in_Japanese_The_Saku_study","318430345_Hypertension_with_diabetes_mellitus_Significance_from_an_epidemiological_perspective_for_Japanese","311484173_Accuracy_and_applicability_of_the_Terumo_ES-H55_double-cuff_sphygmomanometer_for_hospital_use","309895623_Fasting_insulin_insulin_resistance_and_risk_of_hypertension_in_the_general_population_A_meta-analysis","297584186_Sympathetic_Nervous_System_Hypertension_Obesity_and_Metabolic_Syndrome","285794989_International_clinical_harmonization_of_glycated_haemoglobin_in_Japan_From_Japan_Diabetes_Society_to_National_Glycohaemoglobin_Standardization_Program_values","280926415_The_Japanese_Society_of_Hypertension_Guidelines_for_the_Management_of_Hypertension_JSH_2014","268695889_Effect_of_Body_Mass_Index_on_Insulin_Secretion_or_Sensitivity_and_Diabetes","257944478_INTERSALT_an_international_study_of_electrolyte_excretion_and_blood_pressure_Results_for_24h_urinary_sodium_and_potassium_excretion_INTERSALT_Cooperative_Research_Group_BMJ_1988297319-328","241608102_BMI_Compared_With_Central_Obesity_Indicators_in_Relation_to_Diabetes_and_Hypertension_in_Asians","232925942_Alcohol_Consumption_and_the_Risk_of_Hypertension_in_Men_and_Women_A_Systematic_Review_and_Meta-Analysis","49676761_Hemoglobin_A1c_Body_Mass_Index_and_the_Risk_of_Hypertension_in_Women","19261765_Homeostatis_model_assessment_-_Insulin_Resistance_and_Beta-Cell_Function_From_Fasting_Plasma-Glucose_and_insulin_concentration_in_man","12367019_The_role_of_the_body_mass_index_and_triglyceride_levels_in_identifying_insulin-sensitive_and_insulin-resistant_variants_in_Japanese_non-insulin-dependent_diabetic_patients","7484999_The_Impact_of_History_of_Hypertension_and_Type_2_Diabetes_at_Baseline_on_the_Incidence_of_Stroke_and_Stroke_Mortality","7341245_A_Longitudinal_Study_of_Hypertension_Risk_Factors_and_Their_Relation_to_Cardiovascular_Disease_The_Strong_Heart_Study"]}
