In this paper, we explain a Room Escape teaching experience developed in the Engineering School at Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona. The goal of this activity is to increase student’s motivation and to improve their learning on two courses of the second year in the Computer Engineering degree: Computer Networksand Information and Security.","authors":["Carlos Borrego Iglesias","Cristina Fernández-Córdoba","Ian Blanes","S.
