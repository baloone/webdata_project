In addition to explicit confidence judgments (CJ), data for participants’ control behavior during learning and recall as well as implicit CJs were collected with an eye-tracking device (Tobii 1750). Results revealed developmental progression in both accuracy of implicit and explicit monitoring across age groups. In addition, efficiency of learning and recall strategies increases with age, as older participants allocate more fixation time to critical information and less time to peripheral or potentially interfering information. Correlational analyses, recall performance, metacognitive monitoring, and controlling indicate significant interrelations between all of these measures, with varying patterns of correlations within age groups. Results are discussed in regard to the intricate relationship between monitoring and recall and their relation to performance.","authors":["Thomas Roderer","Claudia M Roebers"],"meta":["April 2014Metacognition and Learning","DOI:10.1007/s11409-013-9109-4","Project: Metacoginitive skills of of primary school children"],"references":["319553376_But_I_thought_I_knew_that_using_confidence_estimation_as_a_debiasing_technique_to_improve_classroom_performance","296881415_But_I_thought_I_knew_that_Using_confidence_estimation_as_a_debiasing_technique_to_improve_classroom_performance","289678772_Accuracy_of_metacognitive_monitoring_affects_learning_of_texts","312703877_Eyemovements_during_scene_viewing_An_overview","298972864_Coordinated_control_of_eye_and_hand_movements_in_dynamic_reaching","289963889_Manual_for_Raven's_Progressive_Matrices_and_Vocabulary_Scales","283314316_Procedural_metacognition_in_children_Evidence_for_developmental_trends","280295548_Confidence_judgments_in_children's_and_adult's_event_recall_and_suggestibility","279719307_Eye_Guidance_and_Visual_Information_Processing","279428957_Metamemory_A_Theoretical_Framework_and_New_Findings","268358467_In_Applied_Memory_CHILDREN'S_STRATEGIC_REGULATION_OF_MEMORY_ACCURACY","246857134_But_I_Thought_I_Knew_That_Using_Confidence_Estimation_as_a_Debiasing_Technique_to_Improve_Classroom_Performance","254922629_The_assessment_of_metacognitive_skills_What_can_be_learned_from_multi-method_designs_In_C_Artelt_B_Moschner_Eds","247398730_Determinanten_der_Leistungsvorhersage_bei_Kindergarten_undGrundschulkindern_Zur_Bedeutung_metakognitiver_und_motivationalerEinflussfaktoren","242613982_Eye_Movements_During_Scene_Viewing"]}
