{"id":"307830025_Spectral_density_estimation_for_symmetric_stable_p-adic_processes","abstract":"Applications of p-adic numbers ar beming increasingly important espcially in the field of applied physics. The objective of this work is to study the estimation of the spectral of p-adic stable processes. An estimator formed by a smoothing periodogram is constructed. It is shwon that this estimator is asymptotically unbiased and consistent. Rates of convergences are also examined.","authors":["Rachid Sabre"],"meta":["May 2013","DOI:10.6092/issn.1973-2201/3657"],"references":["307663962_Time_Series_Modelling_and_Decomposition","268999459_Nonparametric_density_estimation_of_continuous_part_of_a_mixed_measure","316807354_Abstract_Harmonic_Analysis","303008325_Generalized_functions_over_the_field_of_p-adic_numbers","281983434_Estimation_de_la_densite_de_la_mesure_spectrale_mixte_pour_un_processus_symetrique_stable_strictement_stationnaire","281158174_Aliasing_free_for_stable_random_fields","269859728_Elements_of_Abstract_Harmonic_Analysis","268991141_Homogeneous_random_processes_on_locally_compact_Abelian_groups","268532467_Complex_symmetric_stable_variables_and_processes","266519660_Some_asymptotics_of_finite_Fourier_transforms_of_a_stationary_p-adic_process"]}
