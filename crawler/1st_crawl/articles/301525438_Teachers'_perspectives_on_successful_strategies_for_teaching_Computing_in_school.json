{"id":"301525438_Teachers'_perspectives_on_successful_strategies_for_teaching_Computing_in_school","abstract":"With the introduction of Computing into the school curriculum in England, experienced teachers are having to teach it for the first time. This raises a number of questions, including whether teachers need to adapt their existing pedagogical strategies to deliver Computing in the curriculum. In this paper we address this particular question through an analysis of qualitative statements made about how to teach Computing by over 300 in-service teachers, who contributed as part of a larger survey. We identify a range of pedagogical strategies that teachers use in practice which can be categorised into the five areas of contextualised learning, computational thinking skills development, code manipulation, working collaboratively and learning away from the computer. We suggest that focusing on the use of a range of these strategies could help teachers to feel more confident in the Computing classroom.","authors":["Sue Sentance","Andrew Csizmadia"],"meta":["July 2015","Conference: IFIP TC3 Working Conference \"A New Culture of Learning: Computing and Next Generations\"At: Vilnius, Lithuania","Project: Pedagogy and CS Education in Schools"],"references":["274377900_Computational_Thinking","266882704_Computer_Science_Unplugged_school_students_doing_real_computing_without_computers","265797241_New_frameworks_for_studying_and_assessing_the_development_of_computational_thinking","262470188_Computer_Science_in_Secondary_Schools_in_the_UK_Ways_to_Empower_Teachers","262330815_Making_computing_interesting_to_school_students_Teachers'_perspectives","321512261_Those_who_Understand_Knowledge_Growth_in_Teaching","299364542_Developing_computational_thinking_in_the_classroom_a_framework","288957532_Qualitative_content_analysis_Forum_Qualitative_Social_Research_Theories_Methods_Applications","266655059_Adoption_of_new_computer_science_high_school_standards_by_New_Zealand_teachers","264543793_Restart_The_Resurgence_of_Computer_Science_in_UK_Schools","262205799_Using_a_discourse-intensive_pedagogy_and_android's_app_inventor_for_introducing_computational_concepts_to_middle_school_students","257137269_Bringing_Computer_Science_Back_Into_Schools_Lessons_from_the_UK","234800767_A_Multi-National_Study_of_Reading_and_Tracing_Skills_in_Novice_Programmers","233869622_Students_teachers_and_phenomena_Educational_reconstruction_for_computer_science_education","243769802_Those_Who_Understand_Knowledge_Growth_in_Teaching"]}
