{"id":"316751995_Appraising_the_Smart_Card_Technology_Adoption_Case_of_Application_in_University_Environment","abstract":"Recently, smart card technology is used in a large variety of applications in many industries. Because of its personal security features such as access control, ability to perform multiple functions and also the capability to upgrade, it could be used as a multi-function card in the university environment. It is important to note that students’ acceptance and confidence are crucial for further development of smart card technology as a university application. This paper aims to investigate the students’ adoption of the technology of university smart card in Iranian universities. In this regards, University Smart Card Technology Acceptance Model (USCTAM) is developed. And then, in order to gain this goal, an online survey was conducted among the students of six private universities in Iran and collected data were analyzed by SPSS software. The results suggest that usefulness, security, ease of use, awareness, support, visibility, image, trailibility, social norms and satisfaction are factors which have significant and positive influence on adopting of smart card technology.","authors":["Hamed Taherdoost"],"meta":["December 2017Procedia Engineering 181:1049-1057","DOI:10.1016/j.proeng.2017.02.506","Project: Smart Card"],"references":["297609723_A_retrospective_critic_Re-Debate_on_Stakeholders'_resistance_checklist_in_software_project_management_within_multi-cultural_multi-ethnical_and_cosmopolitan_society_context_The_Malaysian_experience","282653833_Smart_Card_Security_Technology_and_Adoption","277649061_A_Review_Paper_on_e-service_Technology_Concepts","271889553_Propose_an_educational_plan_for_computer_ethics_and_information_security","260009999_Features'_Evaluation_of_Goods_Services_and_E-Services_Electronic_Service_Characteristics_Exploration","220259897_User_Acceptance_of_Information_Technology_Toward_a_Unified_View","26445604_Young_Generation_Attitudes_and_Awareness_Towards_the_Implementation_of_Smart_Card_in_Bahrain_An_Exploratory_Study","288029321_Armed_with_the_basics","282604736_Adoption_model_to_assess_the_user_acceptance_of_smart_card_technology","3420268_The_smart_card_Don't_leave_home_without_it"]}
