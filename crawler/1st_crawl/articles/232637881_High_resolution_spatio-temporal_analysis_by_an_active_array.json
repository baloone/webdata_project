{"id":"232637881_High_resolution_spatio-temporal_analysis_by_an_active_array","abstract":"We present in this paper a high resolution method for the joint estimation of directions of arrival (DOA) and travel time (TT). This algorithm applies to an active antenna for which the transmitted signal of some sources is known. We show how to take into account the a priori information about the signal in MUSIC. The method is presented and a non asymptotic statistical performance analysis using perturbation expansions is applied. The major result, is a formula for mean-squared error of the DOA and TT estimations. Simulation results verify the analytically predicted performance.","authors":["P. Gounon","S.
