{"id":"299500373_Bio-inspired_heterogeneous_architecture_for_real-time_pedestrian_detection_applications","abstract":"Along with the development of powerful processing platforms, heterogeneous architectures are nowadays permitting new design space explorations. In this paper we propose a novel heterogeneous architecture for reliable pedestrian detection applications. It deploys an efficient Histogram of Oriented Gradient pipeline tightly coupled with a neuro-inspired spatio-temporal filter. By relying on hardware-software co-design principles, our architecture is capable of processing video sequences from real-word dynamic environments in real-time. The paper presents the implemented algorithm and details the proposed architecture for executing it, exposing in particular the partitioning decisions made to meet the required performance. A prototype implementation is described and the results obtained are discussed with respect to other state of the art solutions.","authors":["Luca Maggiani","Cédric Bourrasset","Jean-Charles Quinton","François Berry"],"meta":["March 2018Journal of Real-Time Image Processing 14(3)","DOI:10.1007/s11554-016-0581-3"],"references":["319770205_Monocular_pedestrian_detection_survey_and_experiments","280379597_HOG-Dot_A_Parallel_Kernel-Based_Gradient_Extraction_for_Embedded_Image_Processing","280039741_Parallel_Image_Gradient_Extraction_Core_For_FPGA-based_Smart_Cameras","319770820_Histograms_of_Oriented_Gradients_for_Human_Detection","283878600_A_19TOPS_and_564GOPSW_heterogeneous_multicore_SoC_with_color-based_object_classification_accelerator_for_image-recognition_applications","282682625_A_Review_on_Day-Time_Pedestrian_Detection","281327886_Histograms_of_Oriented_Gradients_for_Human_Detection","278688201_A_new_pedestrian_detection_method_based_on_combined_HOG_and_LSS_features","276923155_An_Efficient_Automatic_Approach_to_High_Performance_Heterogeneous_Computing","276303604_Fast_multi-feature_pedestrian_detection_algorithm_based_on_histogram_of_oriented_gradient_using_discrete_wavelet_transform","272845040_A_Holistic_Approach_for_Modeling_and_Synthesis_of_Image_Processing_Applications_for_Heterogeneous_Computing_Architectures","272183345_Automatic_Optimization_of_Hardware_Accelerators_for_Image_Processing","276126181_Randomly_Spiking_Dynamic_Neural_Fields","273564576_A_Pedestrian-Detection_Method_Based_on_Heterogeneous_Features_and_Ensemble_of_Multi-View-Pose_Parts","273298117_Improving_Pedestrian_Detection_with_Selective_Gradient_Self-Similarity_Feature"]}
