{"id":"303595828_Direct_solution_to_constrained_tropical_optimization_problems_with_application_to_project_scheduling","abstract":"We examine a new optimization problem formulated in the tropical mathematics\nsetting as an extension of certain known problems. The problem is to minimize a\nnonlinear objective function, which is defined on vectors over an idempotent\nsemifield by using multiplicative conjugate transposition, subject to\ninequality constraints. As compared to the known problems, the new one has a\nmore general objective function and additional constraints. We provide a\ncomplete solution in an explicit form to the problem by using an approach that\nintroduces an additional variable to represent the values of the objective\nfunction, and then reduces the initial problem to a parametrized vector\ninequality. The minimum of the objective function is evaluated by applying the\nexistence conditions for the solution of this inequality. A complete solution\nto the problem is given by the solutions of the inequality, provided the\nparameter is set to the minimum value. As a consequence, we obtain solutions to\nnew special cases of the general problem. To illustrate the application of the\nresults, we solve a real-world problem drawn from project scheduling, and offer\na representative numerical example.","authors":["Nikolai Krivulin"],"meta":["January 2017Computational Management Science 14(1)","DOI:10.1007/s10287-016-0259-0","Project: Development of models and methods of tropical mathematics with applications to problems in economics and management"],"references":["311522846_Tropical_optimization_problems_in_time-constrained_project_scheduling","272752008_Tropical_optimization_problems_in_project_scheduling","344154622_Project_Scheduling_A_Research_Handbook","324564788_Tropical_Mathematics","316697516_Idempotent_Analysis_and_Its_Applications","315496490_Project_Scheduling_with_Time_Windows_and_Scarce_Resources","281535227_Asymptotic_behavior_of_dynamic_programming_processes_with_a_continuous_set_of_states","270285354_Max-Plus_Algebra","268642765_Diagonal_similarity_and_equivalence_for_matrices_over_groups_with_O","268605844_Minimax_Algebra","268175056_Semirings_and_Affine_Equations_over_Them_Theory_and_Applications","268020106_A_service_points_location_problem_with_min-max_distance_optimality_criterion","266941054_The_extremal_matrix_algebra","266193429_Graphs_Dioids_and_Semirings_New_Models_and_Algorithms","265459765_Idempotent_analysis_and_its_applications_to_optimal_control"]}
