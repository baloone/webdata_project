{"id":"319888289_The_Methods_of_Knowledge_Acquisition_in_the_Product_Lifecycle_for_a_Generative_Model's_Creation_Process","abstract":"The process of automation becomes popular at different stages of the Product Lifecycle. By applying advanced CAx systems and advanced modelling techniques such as a Generative Modelling, it is possible to design, manufacture and release products onto the market in an easy and fast way. During the Product Lifecycle, a lot of knowledge about the product is generated, however, in the standard process, this knowledge is lost. By using the Knowledge-Based Engineering technique, it is possible to capture, formalise and reuse the knowledge about projects in the future. This approach has a lot of advantages, which are described in this paper.","authors":["Andrzej Jałowiecki","Paweł Kłusek","Wojciech Skarka"],"meta":["December 2017Procedia Manufacturing 11:2219-2226","DOI:10.1016/j.promfg.2017.07.369"],"references":["271272829_Knowledge-Based_Engineering","235705607_Knowledge_Engineering_and_Management_-_The_CommonKADS_Methodology","289823432_Electric_Vehicle_for_the_Students'_Shell_Eco-Marathon_Competition_Design_of_the_Car_and_Telemetry_System","275060342_Transforming_expertise_into_Knowledge-Based_Engineering_tools_A_survey_of_knowledge_sourcing_in_the_context_of_engineering_design","257601768_Adaptable_methodology_for_automation_application_development","257600788_Knowledge_based_engineering_Between_AI_and_CAD_Review_of_a_language_based_technology_to_support_engineering_design","225978060_Knowledge-Based_Engineering_Review_Conceptual_Foundations_and_Research_Issues","222832373_The_application_of_a_knowledge_based_engineering_approach_to_the_rapid_design_and_analysis_of_an_automotive_structure","222592845_Application_of_MOKA_methodology_in_generative_model_creation_using_CATIA","220693056_An_Introduction_to_Knowledge_Engineering"]}
