{"id":"262361915_Learning_DNF_in_time","abstract":"Using techniques from learning theory, we show that any s-term DNF over n variables can be computed by a polynomial threshold function of degree O(n^{1/3} \\log s). This upper bound matches, up to a logarithmic factor, the longstanding lower bound given by Minsky and Papert in their 1968 book {\\em Perceptrons}. As a consequence of this upper bound we obtain the fastest known algorithm for learning polynomial size DNF, one of the central problems in computational learning theory.","authors":["Adam R.
