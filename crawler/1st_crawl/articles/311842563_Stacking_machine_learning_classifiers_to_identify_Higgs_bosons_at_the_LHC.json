{"id":"311842563_Stacking_machine_learning_classifiers_to_identify_Higgs_bosons_at_the_LHC","abstract":"Machine learning (ML) algorithms have been employed in the problem of classifying signal and background events with high accuracy in particle physics. In this paper, we use a widespread ML technique, namely, \\emph{stacked generalization}, for the task of discovering a new neutral Higgs boson in gluon fusion. We found that, at the same time it demands far less computation efforts, \\emph{stacking} ML algorithms performs almost as well as deep neural networks (DNN) trained exclusively with kinematic distributions for the same task by building either a highly discriminating linear model or a shallower neural network with stacked ML outputs. We also show that it is possible to outperform DNN in this channel by partially exploring correlations among the classifiers outputs in a multivariate statistical analysis.","authors":["Alexandre Alves"],"meta":["December 2016Journal of Instrumentation 12(05)","DOI:10.1088/1748-0221/12/05/T05005"],"references":["313156924_Deep-learning_Top_Taggers_or_The_End_of_QCD","310662208_Experiments_using_machine_learning_to_approximate_likelihood_ratios_for_mixture_models","306924609_Measurements_of_the_Higgs_boson_production_and_decay_rates_and_constraints_on_its_couplings_from_a_combined_ATLAS_and_CMS_analysis_of_the_LHC_pp_collision_data_at_s_7_sqrts7_and_8_TeV","301848716_Taming_systematic_uncertainties_at_the_LHC_with_the_central_limit_theorem","327606791_Classification_And_Regression_Trees","309512041_Measurements_of_the_Higgs_boson_production_and_decay_rates_and_constraints_on_its_couplings_from_a_combined_ATLAS_and_CMS_analysis_of_the_LHC_pp_collision_data_at_s_7_and_8_TeV","306187583_Star-galaxy_Classification_Using_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","306150595_Neural_Networks_A_Comprehensive_Foundation","305735565_Jet_Flavor_Classification_in_High-Energy_Physics_with_Deep_Neural_Networks","301878992_Jet_Substructure_Classification_in_High-Energy_Physics_with_Deep_Neural_Networks"]}
