{"id":"343685899_The_methodological_puzzle_of_phenomenal_consciousness","abstract":"Is phenomenal consciousness constitutively related to cognitive access? Despite being a fundamental issue for any science of consciousness, its empirical study faces a severe methodological puzzle. Recent years have seen numerous attempts to address this puzzle, either in practice, by offering evidence for a positive or negative answer, or in principle, by proposing a framework for eventual resolution. The present paper critically considers these endeavours, including partial-report, metacognitive and nProco-report paradigms, as well as the theoretical proposal that we can make progress by studying phenomenal consciousness as a natural kind. It is argued that the methodological puzzle remains obdurately with us and that, for now, we must adopt an attitude of humility towards the phenomenal.","authors":["Ian Phillips"],"meta":["August 2020Philosophical Transactions of The Royal Society B Biological Sciences 373","DOI:10.1098/rstb.2017.0347","Project: Perceptual consciousness and cognitive access"],"references":["325695002_Perceptual_Consciousness_and_Cognitive_Access_from_the_Perspective_of_Capacity-Unlimited_Working_Memory","321212449_Consciousness_Regained_Disentangling_Mechanisms_Brain_Systems_and_Behavioral_Responses","317767295_Does_Perceptual_Consciousness_Overflow_Cognitive_Access_The_Challenge_from_Probabilistic_Hierarchical_Processes","313351367_Are_we_underestimating_the_richness_of_visual_experience","313127886_Conscious_visual_memory_with_minimal_attention","311501707_Brain_Mechanisms_Underlying_the_Brief_Maintenance_of_Seen_and_Unseen_Sensory_Information","304610146_Binocular_rivalry_from_invisible_patterns","284131428_Commentary_Is_the_Frontal_Lobe_Involved_in_Conscious_Perception","283789786_No-Report_Paradigms_Extracting_the_True_Neural_Correlates_of_Consciousness","282608974_Negligible_fronto-parietal_BOLD_activity_accompanying_unreportable_switches_in_bistable_perception","268228253_Blind_Insight_Metacognitive_Discrimination_Despite_Chance_Task_Performance","266626816_Is_the_frontal_lobe_involved_in_conscious_perception","260381066_Changing_concepts_of_working_memory","260253088_Accurate_Metacognition_for_Visual_Sensory_Memory_Representations","259985778_Binocular_Rivalry_Frontal_Activity_Relates_to_Introspection_and_Action_But_Not_to_Perception","257248446_Measures_of_Metacognition_on_Signal-Detection_Theoretic_Models","233940163_Cueing_Attention_after_the_Stimulus_Is_Gone_Can_Retrospectively_Trigger_Conscious_Perception","233936969_Metacognition_Does_Not_Imply_Awareness_Strategy_Choice_Is_Governed_by_Implicit_Learning_and_Memory","225289227_Neuronal_Discharges_and_Gamma_Oscillations_Explicitly_Reflect_Visual_Consciousness_in_the_Lateral_Prefrontal_Cortex","225086474_Methodological_Encounters_with_the_Phenomenal_Kind","221893456_Are_multiple_visual_short-term_memory_storages_necessary_to_explain_the_retro-cue_effect","326691748_Dream_experiences_and_the_neural_correlates_of_perceptual_consciousness_and_cognitive_access","323647881_Neural_Mechanisms_of_Two_Different_Verbal_Working_Memory_Tasks_A_VLSM_Study","319382249_Multistable_Perception_and_the_Role_of_Frontoparietal_Cortex_in_Perceptual_Inference","310627648_An_Interference_Model_of_Visual_Working_Memory","308017162_What_Type_of_Awareness_Does_Binocular_Rivalry_Assess","299520001_Can_you_perceive_ensembles_without_perceiving_individuals_The_role_of_statistical_perception_in_determining_whether_awareness_overflows_access","294422043_Can_No-Report_Paradigms_Extract_True_Correlates_of_Consciousness","292192425_Towards_a_Neurobiological_Theory_of_Consciousness","289172575_Nonconceptual_Content_Richness_and_Fineness_of_Grain","286767391_Block's_Overflow_Argument","282581509_Phenomenal_and_access_consciousness_Ned_Block_and_Cynthia_MacDonald_Consciousness_and_cognitive_access","282461324_No_watershed_for_overflow_Recent_work_on_the_richness_of_consciousness","272096560_On_the_Independence_of_Visual_Awareness_and_Metacognition_A_Signal_Detection_Theoretic_Analysis","264291835_Gamma_band_activity_and_the_P3_reflect_post-perceptual_processes_not_visual_awareness","262817279_Rich_conscious_perception_outside_focal_attention","262225991_We_See_More_Than_We_Can_Report_Cost_Free_Color_Phenomenality_Outside_Focal_Attention","260876298_Can_binocular_rivalry_reveal_neural_correlates_of_consciousness","257310079_Frontoparietal_Cortex_Mediates_Perceptual_Transitions_in_Bistable_Perception","247590715_Some_Varieties_of_Functionalism","240213428_Knowledge_and_The_Flow_of_Information","233820871_Consciousness_Explained","233189457_How_neuroscience_will_change_our_view_on_consciousness","232566331_Recognizing_The_judgment_of_previous_occurrence","232515578_An_Illusion_of_Memory_False_Recognition_Influenced_by_Unconscious_Perception","232472186_Illusions_of_familiarity","231911080_Semantic_activation_without_conscious_identification_in_dichotic_listening_parafoveal_vision_and_visual_masking_A_survey_and_appraisal","227714371_Perception_and_Iconic_Memory_What_Sperling_Doesn't_Show","227529087_Attention_Visual_Consciousness_and_Indeterminacy","226162456_Change_Blindness","216305916_Consciousness_Lost_and_Found","216305594_Phenomenal_experience_and_functionalism","215606073_Signal_Detection_Theory_in_Psychophysics","51972937_Cognitive_and_non-cognitive_conceptions_of_consciousness","51828805_Working_memory_without_consciousness"]}
