{"id":"256673163_The_Role_of_Precision_Engineering_in_Manufacturing_of_the_Future","abstract":"High precision manufacturing, and thus the development of new and improved high precision processes and machines, has gained much greater prominence in the last decade. Many advanced technology products depend entirely on one or more components being manufactured to tolerances or dimensions in the micro-or even nanotechnology range. The paper gives a few examples and summarises today's state-of-the-art in dimensional measurement and servo motion control for instruments and ultra precision machine systems needed to meet this growing demand. A forward look is made at ‘atomic-bit’ engineering based on scanning tunnelling microscopy.","authors":["P.A.
