{"id":"275097039_A_Technique_for_Offline_Handwritten_Character_Recognition","abstract":"Offline handwritten character recognition has been\none of the most engrossing and challenging research areas in the\nfield of pattern recognition in the recent years. Offline\nhandwritten character recognition is a very problematic research\narea because writing styles may vary from one user to another. In\nthis paper a proposed technique for offline handwritten\nGurmukhi character recognition has been presented. The success\nrate of our proposed scheme depends upon the feature extraction\ntechnique which has been applied in this work. We have\nproposed a feature extraction technique named as Neighborhood\nForeground Pixels Density technique. As there could be some\ninsignificant feature values so to reject those we have used a\ndimensionality reduction technique namely Principal component\nanalysis (PCA). Maximum recognition accuracy of 91.95% has\nbeen achieved with SVM (Radial Basis function kernel) classifier\nby using 10 fold cross validation test method.","authors":["Shilpy Bansal","Mamta Garg","Munish Kumar"],"meta":["January 2014"],"references":["285663733_Data_classification_using_support_vector_machine","284966145_Handwritten_Gurmukhi_Character_Recognition_Using_Statistical_and_Background_Directional_Distribution_Features","280063801_Recognition_of_Devanagari_Handwritten_Numerals_using_Gradient_Features_and_SVM","268514513_Classification_of_Characters_and_Grading_Writers_in_Offline_Handwritten_Gurmukhi_Script","267944005_Use_of_Gabor_Filters_for_Recognition_of_Handwritten_Gurmukhi_Character","254686762_A_Comparative_Study_of_Optical_Character_Recognition_for_Tamil_Script","318748379_Identifying_the_Character_by_Applying_PCA_Method_using_Matlab","309121181_A_literature_review_on_hand_written_character_recognition","265884110_Freeman_Code_Based_Online_Handwritten_Character_Recognition_for_Malayalam_using_Backpropagation_Neural_Networks","261313646_New_Advancements_in_Zoning-Based_Recognition_of_Handwritten_Characters"]}
