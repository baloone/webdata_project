{"id":"335983238_Collaborative_training_of_far_infrared_and_visible_models_for_human_detection","abstract":"This paper is about the collaborative training of a far infrared and a visible spectrum human detector; the idea is to use the strengths of one detector to fill the weaknesses of the other detector and vice versa. At first infrared and visible human detectors are pre-trained using initial training datasets. Then, the detectors are used to collect as many detections as possible. The validity of each detection is tested using a low-level criteria based on an objectness measure. New training data are generated in a coupled way based on these detections and thus reinforce both the infrared and the visible human detectors in the same time. In this paper, we showed that this semi-supervised approach can significantly improve the performance of the detectors. This approach is a good solution to generate infrared training data, this kind of data being rarely available in the community.","authors":["Paul Blondel","Alex Potelle","Claude PÃ©gard","Rogelio Lozano"],"meta":["January 2019International Journal for Simulation and Multidisciplinary Design Optimization 10:A15","DOI:10.1051/smdo/2019016"],"references":["285966614_Pedestrian_detection_in_infrared_images_using_Aggregated_Channel_Features","256661993_Pedestrian_Detection_in_Far_Infrared_Images","319770820_Histograms_of_Oriented_Gradients_for_Human_Detection","319770284_Edge_Boxes_Locating_Object_Proposals_from_Edges","319769911_Faster_R-CNN_Towards_Real-Time_Object_Detection_with_Region_Proposal_Networks","311609522_You_Only_Look_Once_Unified_Real-Time_Object_Detection","281327886_Histograms_of_Oriented_Gradients_for_Human_Detection","278049038_You_Only_Look_Once_Unified_Real-Time_Object_Detection","264579180_Fast_Feature_Pyramids_for_Object_Detection","250651979_Contrast_Invariant_Features_for_Human_Detection_in_Far_Infrared_Images"]}
