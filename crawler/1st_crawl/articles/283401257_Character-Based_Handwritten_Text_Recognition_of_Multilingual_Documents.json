{"id":"283401257_Character-Based_Handwritten_Text_Recognition_of_Multilingual_Documents","abstract":"An effective approach to transcribe handwritten text documents is to follow a sequential interactive approach. During the supervision phase, user corrections are incorporated into the system through an ongoing retraining process. In the case of multilingual documents with a high percentage of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, two principal issues arise. On the one hand, a minor yet important matter for this interactive approach is to identify the language of the current text line image to be transcribed, as a language dependent recognisers typically performs better than a monolingual recogniser. On the other hand, word-based language models suffer from data scarcity in the presence of a large number of OOV words, degrading their estimation and affecting the performance of the transcription system. In this paper, we successfully tackle both issues deploying character-based language models combined with language identification techniques on an entire 764-page multilingual document. The results obtained significantly reduce previously reported results in terms of transcription error on the same task, but showed that a language dependent approach is not effective on top of character-based recognition of similar languages.","authors":["Miguel Ángel Del Agua Teba","Nicolás Serrano","Jorge Civera","Alfons Juan"],"meta":["January 2012Communications in Computer and Information Science 328:187-196","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-35292-8_20"],"references":["221607842_Balancing_error_and_supervision_effort_in_interactive-predictive_handwriting_recognition","221490881_The_RWTH_Aachen_University_open_source_speech_recognition_system","221489081_Open_vocabulary_speech_recognition_with_flat_hybrid_models","221383052_The_GIDOC_prototype","221052305_Adaptation_from_partially_supervised_handwritten_text_transcriptions","221052282_Active_learning_strategies_for_handwritten_text_transcription","47544548_Script_Recognition-A_Review","24213728_A_Novel_Connectionist_System_for_Unconstrained_Handwriting_Recognition","316589043_Multilingual_Speech_Processing","242376908_An_Introduction_to_The_Bootstrap","226662568_The_IAM-database_An_English_sentence_database_for_offline_handwriting_recognition","224382275_Sub-word_modeling_of_out_of_vocabulary_words_in_spoken_term_detection","224181122_Unconstrained_offline_handwriting_recognition_using_connectionist_character_N-grams","221259128_Language_Identification_for_Interactive_Handwriting_Transcription_of_Multilingual_Documents","220861984_The_GERMANA_database","2602251_Srilm_---_An_Extensible_Language_Modeling_Toolkit","2423590_Off-Line_Handwriting_Recognition_Using_Various_Hybrid_Modeling_Techniques_And_Character_N-Grams"]}
