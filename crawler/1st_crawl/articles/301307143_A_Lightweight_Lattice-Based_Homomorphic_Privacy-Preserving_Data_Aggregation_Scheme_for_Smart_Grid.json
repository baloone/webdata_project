{"id":"301307143_A_Lightweight_Lattice-Based_Homomorphic_Privacy-Preserving_Data_Aggregation_Scheme_for_Smart_Grid","abstract":"Consumer privacy and consumption confidentiality and integrity are the main security concerns for smart grid connection with the residential electricity consumers. This paper proposes a lightweight privacy-preserving electricity consumption aggregation scheme that exploits lightweight lattice-based homomorphic cryptosystem. In the proposed scheme, smart household appliances aggregate their readings without involving the smart meter. Although smart meters or the intermediate base station cannot decrypt this aggregated consumption, they can validate the message’s authenticity. The proposed scheme also investigates the impact of different types of smart appliances on the home area network’s overhead. The total communication and computation load for the proposed scheme is trivial and tolerable by different parties in the connection, i.e., smart appliances, smart meters, and the base station. In addition, the deployed cryptosystem, which depends on simple arithmetic operations, can further reduce the computation duty for smart appliances. Simulation results and security analysis show that our proposed scheme guarantees consumers privacy and messages authenticity and integrity, with lightweight communication and computation complexity.","authors":["Asmaa Abdallah","Xuemin Sherman Shen"],"meta":["April 2016IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TSG.2016.2553647"],"references":["260711226_Privacy-Enhanced_Data_Aggregation_Scheme_Against_Internal_Attackers_in_Smart_Grid","260670952_Smart_Grid_-_The_New_and_Improved_Power_Grid_A_Survey","260670326_Secure_service_provision_in_smart_grid_communications","260670185_Securing_smart_grid_Cyber_attacks_countermeasures_and_challenges","260648230_Smart_Meter_Privacy_A_Theoretical_Framework","236621818_Increasing_Smart_Meter_Privacy_Through_Energy_Harvesting_and_Storage_Devices","224324930_Lattice-based_homomorphic_encryption_of_vector_spaces","220592735_A_Lightweight_Message_Authentication_Scheme_for_Smart_Grid_Communications","286747394_Lightweight_lattice-based_homomorphic_privacy-preserving_aggregation_scheme_for_home_area_networks","282744015_A_lightweight_lattice-based_security_and_privacy-preserving_scheme_for_smart_grid","270767506_A_Distortion-Based_Approach_to_Privacy-Preserving_Metering_in_Smart_Grids","263894703_EPPDR_An_Efficient_Privacy-Preserving_Demand_Response_Scheme_with_Adaptive_Key_Evolution_in_Smart_Grid","262528259_An_Efficient_Merkle-Tree-Based_Authentication_Scheme_for_Smart_Grid","262528258_Efficient_Authentication_and_Key_Management_Mechanisms_for_Smart_Grid_Communications","262528256_Human-Factor-Aware_Privacy-Preserving_Aggregation_in_Smart_Grid","262528250_Achieving_Accountability_in_Smart_Grid","261801398_Communication_network_requirements_for_major_smart_grid_applications_in_HAN_NAN_and_WAN","260670953_Cyber_Security_and_Privacy_Issues_in_Smart_Grids","260670182_Privacy-Preserving_Advance_Power_Reservation","260667483_Device_Authentication_Protocol_for_Smart_Grid_Systems_Using_Homomorphic_Hash","260648150_A_Decentralized_Security_Framework_for_Data_Aggregation_and_Access_Control_in_Smart_Grids","260647983_Residential_Appliance_DR_Energy_Management_With_Electric_Privacy_Protection_by_Online_Stochastic_Optimization","260635505_Distributed_Privacy-Preserving_Aggregation_of_Metering_Data_in_Smart_Grids","260357862_EPPA_An_Efficient_and_Privacy-Preserving_Aggregation_Scheme_for_Secure_Smart_Grid_Communications","258792218_Privacy-Preserving_Data_Aggregation_in_Smart_Metering_Systems_An_Overview","254058758_Toward_Secure_Targeted_Broadcast_in_Smart_Grid","221284847_A_Secure_Data_Aggregation_and_Dispatch_Scheme_for_Home_Area_Networks_in_Smart_Grid","220592762_Security_Technology_for_Smart_Grid_Networks","220473434_Cyber-Physical_System_Security_for_the_Electric_Power_Grid","220334791_A_Lattice-Based_Computationally-Efficient_Private_Information_Retrieval_Protocol"]}
