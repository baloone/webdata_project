{"id":"280097408_InferenceMAP_mapping_of_single-molecule_dynamics_with_Bayesian_inference","abstract":"Cellular processes critically depend on the behavior of individual molecules. Through recent high-density single-particle tracking techniques, information about the dynamic environment experienced by molecules may be accessed through powerful statistical models. We present InferenceMAP, an interactive software tool that uses a powerful Bayesian technique to extract the parameters that describe the motion of individual molecules (diffusion, force, drift, and interaction energy) from single-molecule trajectories. Principle features include a versatile Bayesian analysis platform, extensive mapping functions which permit generation of dynamic landscapes of entire cells, and numerous user-friendliness considerations. InferenceMAP is controlled via a graphical user interface and is compatible with Mac OS X and Windows.","authors":["Mohamed El Beheiry"],"meta":["June 2015Nature Methods 12(7):594-595","DOI:10.1038/nmeth.3441"],"references":["259808467_Objective_Comparison_of_Particle_Tracking_Methods","24173822_Inferring_Maps_of_Forces_Inside_Cell_Membrane_Microdomains","5658572_High-density_mapping_of_single-molecule_trajectories_with_photoactivated_localization_microscopy","263207942_Tracking_single_molecules_at_work_in_living_cells","259697186_Mapping_the_Energy_and_Diffusion_Landscapes_of_Membrane_Proteins_at_the_Cell_Surface_Using_High-Density_Single-Molecule_Imaging_and_Bayesian_Inference_Application_to_the_Multiscale_Dynamics_of_Glycine","45659330_Dynamic_Superresolution_Imaging_of_Endogenous_Proteins_on_Living_Cells_at_Ultra-High_Density"]}
