{"id":"335358775_Twelve_quick_tips_for_designing_sound_dynamical_models_for_bioprocesses","abstract":"Because of the inherent complexity of bioprocesses, mathematical models are more and more used for process design, control, optimization, etc. These models are generally based on a set of biochemical reactions. Model equations are then derived from mass balance, coupled with empirical kinetics. Biological models are nonlinear and represent processes, which by essence are dynamic and adaptive. The temptation to embed most of the biology is high, with the risk that calibration would not be significant anymore. The most important task for a modeler is thus to ensure a balance between model complexity and ease of use. Since a model should be tailored to the objectives, which will depend on applications and environment, a universal model representing any possible situation is probably not the best option.","authors":["Francis Mairet","Olivier Bernard"],"meta":["August 2019PLoS Computational Biology 15(8):e1007222","DOI:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007222"],"references":["319290237_Modeling_the_temperature_effect_on_the_specific_growth_rate_of_phytoplankton_a_review","317378754_Dynamic_metabolic_modeling_of_heterotrophic_and_mixotrophic_microalgal_growth_on_fermentative_wastes","305844555_Influence_of_temperature_on_Chlorella_vulgaris_growth_and_mortality_rates_in_a_photobioreactor","289927816_Activated_Sludge_Models_ASM1_ASM2_ASM2D_ASM3","261186420_Ten_Simple_Rules_for_Effective_Computational_Research","312692234_The_IWA_anaerobic_digestion_model_no_1_ADM1","279236921_Multimodel_Inference_understanding_AIC_and_BIC_in_Model_Selection","278692270_Applied_and_Numerical_Harmonic_Analysis","277006727_Nonlinear_Dynamics_and_Chaos_With_Applications_to_Physics_Biology_Chemistry_and_Engineering","274264352_Mathematical_modeling_of_unicellular_microalgae_and_cyanobacteria_metabolism_for_biofuel_production"]}
