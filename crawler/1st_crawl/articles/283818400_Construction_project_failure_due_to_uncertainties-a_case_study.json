{"id":"283818400_Construction_project_failure_due_to_uncertainties-a_case_study","abstract":"During recent years, there has been a major interest in managing uncertainties to increase the level of projectâ€™s success. Among the engineering activities, construction is one of the projects which is associated with a high degree of uncertainty and risk due to the nature of its business character. There foremanaging of uncertainties, as the main causes of failure in construction has been recognized as a very important task in order to achieve the project objectives. The scope of this study is an attempt to make a more clear understanding of uncertainties in construction projects which may result in undesirable failures. This task has been supported by a decision model to define and understand more clearly the different concepts of risk including uncertainties in a decision process. Furthermore, the defined concepts have been validated in a historical case.","authors":["Prof. Dr. Mohammad Shahriari","Gerard Sauce","Buhe Catherine","Herve Boileau"],"meta":["February 2015","DOI:10.1201/b18042-35","Project: 1.
