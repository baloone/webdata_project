{"id":"259397049_Normalized_Gaussian_approach_to_statistical_modeling_of_OFDM_signals","abstract":"This article concerns modeling of statistical properties of OFDM signals with the help of \"normalized Gaussian\" model, proposed by Kotzer et al. In this paper there is provided an extended formulation of the model, supplemented by an expression for probability density, extending possible applications of the model in theoretical works. Numerical results for verification of the model are provided and a more accurate alternative is suggested.","authors":["Adam Rudzi≈Ñski"],"meta":["March 2014Journal of Telecommunications and Information Technology"],"references":["264397848_Synthesis_of_Band-Limited_Orthogonal_Signals_for_Multichannel_Data_Transmission","261055676_A_model_for_OFDM_signals_with_applications","224730856_Data_Transmission_by_Frequency-Division_Multiplexing_Using_the_Discrete_Fourier_Transform","224730547_Performance_of_an_Efficient_Parallel_Data_Transmission_System","224669389_SNR_and_spectral_properties_for_a_clipped_DMT_ADSL_signal","200524201_Synthesis_of_band-limited_orthogonal_signals_for_multi-channel_data_transmission","3372722_Effect_of_amplitude_clipping_in_DMT-ADSL_transceivers"]}
