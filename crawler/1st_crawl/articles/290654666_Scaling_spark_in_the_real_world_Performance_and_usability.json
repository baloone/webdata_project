{"id":"290654666_Scaling_spark_in_the_real_world_Performance_and_usability","abstract":"Apache Spark is one of the most widely used open source processing engines for big data, with rich language-integrated APIs and a wide range of libraries. Over the past two years, our group has worked to deploy Spark to a wide range of or- ganizations through consulting relationships as well as our hosted service, Databricks. We describe the main challenges and requirements that appeared in taking Spark to a wide set of users, and usability and performance improvements we have made to the engine in response.","authors":["Michael Armbrust","Tathagata Das","A.
