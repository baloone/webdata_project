{"id":"329369599_Social_Spider_Optimization_Algorithm_Modifications_Applications_and_Perspectives","abstract":"Swarm intelligence (SI) is a research field which has recently attracted the attention of several scientific communities. An SI approach tries to characterize the collective behavior of animal or insect groups to build a search strategy. These methods consider biological systems, which can be modeled as optimization processes to a certain extent. The Social Spider Optimization (SSO) is a novel swarm algorithm that is based on the cooperative characteristics of the social spider. In SSO, search agents represent a set of spiders which collectively move according to the biological behavior of the colony. In most of SI algorithms, all individuals are modeled considering the same properties and behavior. In contrast, SSO defines two different search agents: male and female. Therefore, according to the gender, each individual is conducted by using a different evolutionary operation which emulates its biological role in the colony. This individual categorization allows reducing critical flaws present in several SI approaches such as incorrect exploration-exploitation balance and premature convergence. After its introduction, SSO has been modified and applied in several engineering domains. In this paper, the state of the art, improvements, and applications of the SSO are reviewed.","authors":["Alberto Luque Chang","Erik Cuevas","Fernando Fausto","Daniel Zaldivar"],"meta":["December 2018Mathematical Problems in Engineering 2018(2):1-29","DOI:10.1155/2018/6843923"],"references":["319638209_Sensor_Deployment_Scheme_Based_on_Social_Spider_Optimization_Algorithm_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","318924601_Improved_social_spider_optimization_algorithms_for_solving_inverse_radiation_and_coupled_radiation-conduction_heat_transfer_problems","317647698_Anti-Islanding_Protection_of_Distributed_Generation_Based_on_Social_Spider_Optimization_Technique","314391420_Evolutionary_calibration_of_fractional_fuzzy_controllers","312142612_An_improved_social_spider_optimization_algorithm_based_on_rough_sets_for_solving_minimum_number_attribute_reduction_problem","332268364_Genetic_Algorithm_Review_and_Application","320027765_Design_of_Tubular_Permanent_Magnet_Generators_for_Vehicle_Energy_Harvesting_by_Means_of_Social_Network_Optimization","317785693_A_simplex_method-based_social_spider_optimization_algorithm_for_clustering_analysis","316267361_Text_clustering_quality_improvement_using_a_hybrid_social_spider_optimization","312180503_Elite_Opposition-Based_Social_Spider_Optimization_Algorithm_for_Global_Function_Optimization"]}
