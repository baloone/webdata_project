Based on that, the automated medical diagnosis became a necessity due to its important role in reducing clinicians' efforts and providing fast and accurate results. Remote Patients Monitoring (RPM) devices are used for this purpose by making tests and sending the results to the professionals. The proposed system is built based on three medical indicators (blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature).The system combined both fuzzy inference system and Arduino to collect medical data, process them and make decision. The medical data are collected through sensors related to each indicator. Arduino is used to collect the sensory data and send them to Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) in order to get the infer result information to make decision. FIS gets the medical sensory data, processes them to make the assessment and sends medical state as a numeric result to Arduino to make the decision. FIS used a knowledge base written in IF-THEN rules composed of multiple linguistic variables. The proposed system can be used to help the doctors in determining the initial medical state of patients and make the right decision.","authors":["Aqeel Majeed Humadi","Alaa Khalaf"],"meta":["April 2017International Journal of Computer Science and Information Security, 15(4):197","DOI:10.2139/ssrn.3027091"],"references":["303498810_Smart_Real-Time_Healthcare_Monitoring_and_Tracking_System_using_GSMGPS_Technologies","299469654_Remote_Patient_Tracking_and_Monitoring_System","282747944_Effective_diagnosis_and_monitoring_of_heart_disease","292516812_Fuzzy_inference_system","290801764_Fuzzy_system_are_universal_approximators","260986133_Neuro-fuzzy_and_soft_computing_a_computational_approach_to_learning_and_machine_intelligence","222246755_An_expert_system_approach_based_on_principal_component_analysis_and_adaptive_neuro-fuzzy_inference_system_to_diagnosis_of_diabetes_disease","220313001_Computer_aided_fuzzy_medical_diagnosis","30871146_Neuro-Fuzzy_and_Soft_Computing--A_Computational_Approach_to_Learning_and_Machine_Intelligence","7690621_Adaptive_neuro-fuzzy_inference_system_for_classification_of_EEG_signals_using_wavelet_coefficients"]}
