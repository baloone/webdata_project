{"id":"303800742_Enhancing_products_and_services_using_smart_appliance_networks","abstract":"The Internet of things (IoT) plays important roles in the servitization of manufacturing, especially in B2B businesses. This discussion addresses the potential of IoT in B2C businesses for the domain of consumer electronics. It presents an analytical example of 600 users’ smart appliance logs combined with responses to a questionnaire survey on their lifestyles to clarify consumers’ daily behaviors. This study examines the log data format which might be used for the design of new products, maintenance, or services. Finally, simulation results demonstrate how smart appliance data are expected to be useful for mass customization or creation of new services.","authors":["Takeshi Takenaka","Yoshinobu Yamamoto","Ken Fukuda","Ayaka Kimura"],"meta":["June 2016CIRP Annals - Manufacturing Technology 65(1)","DOI:10.1016/j.cirp.2016.04.062"],"references":["276937714_Productservice_variety_strategy_considering_mixed_distribution_of_human_lifestyles","272566759_Evolving_to_a_New_Dominant_Logic","259085303_Product_variety_management","232361494_Cooperative_and_responsive_manufacturing_enterprises","223169658_Value_creation_and_decision-making_in_sustainable_society","313060232_Learning_Internal_Representations_by_Error_Propagation","298788897_Smart_appliance_network_as_cyber_physical_systems_Creating_value_to_meet_various_consumer_lifestyles","243743707_Learning_Internal_Representations_by_Error_Propagation","224184058_Design_and_Implementation_of_Smart_Home_Energy_Management_Systems_based_on_ZigBee","223195362_Design_for_Mass_Personalization"]}
