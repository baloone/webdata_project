{"id":"307090548_Scaffolding_Algorithms","abstract":"This chapter describes some of the state-of-the-art scaffolding tools: SSAKE-based Scaffolding of Pre-Assembled Contigs after Extension (SSPACE), OPERA, Scaffolding algorithm for paired reads via statistical optimization (SOPRA), Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP), and SCARPA. It provides a deep insight into two recent scaffolding tools: SILP2 and ScaffMatch. The chapter presents the key steps of the algorithm, including scaffolding graph construction, the maximum likelihood models used for contig orientation, and maps read pair probability estimation. It presents an overview of the orientation, the ILP formulation, and the improved NSDP algorithms. The chapter introduces an F-score-based metric in order to compare the performance of stand-alone scaffolding tools. It evaluates scaffolders on how well the joins predicted by the tool correspond to the real joins between contigs in the reference genome. The chapter provides performance metrics and evaluates scaffolding tools based on these metrics.","authors":["Igor Mandric","James Lindsay","Ion I Mandoiu","A.
