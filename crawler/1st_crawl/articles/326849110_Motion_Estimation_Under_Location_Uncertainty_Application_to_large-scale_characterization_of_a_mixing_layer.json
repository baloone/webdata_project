{"id":"326849110_Motion_Estimation_Under_Location_Uncertainty_Application_to_large-scale_characterization_of_a_mixing_layer","abstract":"We propose a novel motion estimation from image sequences method to study turbulent flows. This method\nconsists in modeling the luminance motions between successive frames as a new stochastic scalar transport\nequation. Thanks to stochastic formalism the motion field is separated into a large-scale smooth component and a\nrandom small-scale component. This decomposition gives rise to the mentioned new stochastic transport equation\nthat takes into account the interactions between observed large scales and unresolved ones. This equation provides\na new data term for optical flow algorithm. We then resolved the aperture problem with local Lucas-Kanade\napproach. We show that the method improves the motion estimation on a synthetic case. Then the method is tested\non real large-scale observations of a mixing layer. Two kinds of tracers are compared and a new lighting system\nbased on LED technology is employed to perform this large-scale experiment.","authors":["Romain Schuster","Dominique Heitz","Étienne Mémin"],"meta":["July 2018","Conference: 19th International Symposium on Applications of Laser and Imaging Techniques to Fluid MechanicsAt: Lisbon","Project: On-site Airflow Measurement"],"references":["283423100_Improved_subgrid_scale_models_for_Large_Eddy_Simulation","280778126_Particle-Imaging_Techniques_for_Experimental_Fluid_Mechanics"]}
