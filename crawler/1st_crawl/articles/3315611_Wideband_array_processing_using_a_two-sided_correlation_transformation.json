{"id":"3315611_Wideband_array_processing_using_a_two-sided_correlation_transformation","abstract":"A new method for broadband array processing is proposed. The\nmethod is based on unitary transformation of the signal subspaces. We\napply a two-sided transformation on the correlation matrices of the\narray. It is shown that the two-sided correlation transformation (TCT)\nhas a smaller subspace fitting error than the coherent signal-subspace\nmethod (CSM). It is also shown that unlike CSM, the TCT algorithm can\ngenerate unbiased estimates of the directions-of-arrival, regardless of\nthe bandwidth of the signals. The capability of the TCT and CSM methods\nfor resolving two closely spaced sources is compared. The resolution\nthreshold for the new technique is much smaller than that for CSM","authors":["Shahrokh Valaee","Peter Kabal"],"meta":["February 1995IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing 43(1):160 - 172","DOI:10.1109/78.365295","SourceIEEE Xplore"],"references":["3523163_Detection_of_coherent_and_noncoherent_signals_via_the_stochastic_signals_model","3177612_Spatio-Temporal_Spectral_Analysis_by_Eigenstructure_Methods","317661721_Introduction_to_Multivariate_Statistical_Analysis","238675693_An_introduction_to_multivariate_statistical_analysis_2nd_ed","232649270_Detection_of_the_number_of_signals_using_predictive_stochastic_complexity","221932985_Matrix_Analysis","215721501_Matrix_Computations","3314489_On_Focusing_Matrices_for_Wide-Band_Array_Processing","3314055_A_Resolution_Measure_for_the_MUSIC_Algorithm_and_Its_Application_to_Plane_Wave_Arrivals_Contaminated_by_Coherent_Interference","3177832_Coherent_signal-subspace_processing_for_the_detection_and_estimation_of_Angles_of_arrival_of_multiple_wide-band_sources","3175580_Multiple_broad-band_source_location_using_steered_covariance_matrices","3175392_Source_Location_Bias_In_The_Coherently_Focused_High-Resolution_Broadband_Beamformer","3175330_Focusing_matrices_for_coherent_signal-subspace_processing","3175306_Broad-band_signal-subspace_spatial-spectrum_BASS-ALE_estimation","3016535_Multiple_Emitter_Location_and_Signal_Parameter_Estimation"]}
