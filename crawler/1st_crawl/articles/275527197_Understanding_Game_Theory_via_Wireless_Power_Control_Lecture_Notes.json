{"id":"275527197_Understanding_Game_Theory_via_Wireless_Power_Control_Lecture_Notes","abstract":"In this lecture note, we introduce the basic concepts of game theory (GT), a\nbranch of mathematics traditionally studied and applied in the areas of\neconomics, political science, and biology, which has emerged in the last\nfifteen years as an effective framework for communications, networking, and\nsignal processing (SP). The real catalyzer has been the blooming of all issues\nrelated to distributed networks, in which the nodes can be modeled as players\nin a game competing for system resources. Some relevant notions of GT are\nintroduced by elaborating on a simple application in the context of wireless\ncommunications, notably the power control in an interference channel (IC) with\ntwo transmitters and two receivers.","authors":["Giacomo Bacci","Luca Sanguinetti","Marco Luise"],"meta":["April 2015IEEE Signal Processing Magazine 32(4)","DOI:10.1109/MSP.2015.2406338","SourcearXiv"],"references":["263048843_Multi-Objective_Signal_Processing_Optimization_The_Way_to_Balance_Conflicting_Metrics_in_5G_Systems","224586614_Coalitional_Game_Theory_for_Communication_Networks","224131020_Convex_Optimization_Game_Theory_and_Variational_Inequality_Theory","221933043_Distributed_Learning_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","324396684_Game_Theory","286868893_How_to_use_a_strategic_game_to_optimize_the_performance_of_CDMA_wireless_network_synchronization","278768710_Game_Theory_and_Learning_for_Wireless_Networks_Fundamentals_and_Applications","267132783_Game_Theory_in_Wireless_and_Communication_Networks_Theory_Models_and_Applications","261362540_Game_Theory_and_Learning_for_Wireless_Networks","221933025_Consensus_and_Cooperation_in_Networked_Multi-Agent_Systems"]}
