{"id":"259745607_Identity_and_the_Theory_of_Planned_Behavior_Predicting_Maintenance_of_Volunteering_After_Three_Years","abstract":"Is identity an important predictor of social behaviour? The present longitudinal\nstudy is focused on identity in order to understand why people continue to volunteer over an\nextended period of time. Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) and the Role Identity Model of\nVolunteering are used as theoretical framework. 230 Italian volunteers were sampled and\nfollowed for three years. We analysed functions of role identity as a volunteer. Results showed a\nsignificant impact of role identity in predicting volunteer performance after 3 years, mediated\nthrough behavioural intentions. Role identity fully mediated the relationships between\nbehavioural intention and attitude, social norms, past behaviour and parental modelling.","authors":["Elena Marta","Claudia Manzi","Maura Pozzi","Vivian L Vignoles"],"meta":["January 2014The Journal of Social Psychology 154(3):198-207","DOI:10.1080/00224545.2014.881769"],"references":["345705695_The_Social_Psychology_of_Prosocial_Behavior","313606319_From_role-playing_to_role-using_Understanding_role_as_a_resource","313006266_Towards_an_adequate_social_psychology_of_self","296669905_Le_famiglie_dei_giovani-adulti_volontari_e_la_trasmissione_tra_le_generazioni_stili_relazionali_a_confronto","283986129_Identity_in_Modern_Society_A_Social_Psychological_Perspective","273745730_Identity_in_Modern_Society_A_Social_Psychological_Perspective","272689547_Toward_an_Adequate_Social_Psychology_of_the_Self","271777494_The_Link_Between_Identity_and_Role_Performance","270302557_The_Past_Present_and_Future_of_An_Identity_Theory","267154013_El_modelo_de_la_identidad_de_rol_de_voluntario_analisis_de_sus_componentes_basicos_en_una_muestra_de_voluntarios"]}
