{"id":"328765636_Deep_Denoising_for_Hearing_Aid_Applications","abstract":"Reduction of unwanted environmental noises is an important feature of todayâ€™s hearing aids (HA), which is why noise re- duction is nowadays included in almost every commercially available device. The majority of these algorithms, however, is restricted to the reduction of stationary noises.\nIn this work, we propose a denoising approach based on a three hidden layer fully connected deep learning network that aims to predict a Wiener filtering gain with an asymmetric input context, enabling real-time applications with high con- straints on signal delay. The approach is employing a hearing instrument-grade filter bank and complies with typical hear- ing aid demands, such as low latency and on-line processing. It can further be well integrated with other algorithms in an existing HA signal processing chain.\nWe can show on a database of real world noise signals that our algorithm is able to outperform a state of the art baseline approach, both using objective metrics and subject tests.","authors":["Marc Aubreville","K.
