{"id":"325497554_Parsing_Based_Sarcasm_Detection_from_Literal_Language_in_Tweets","abstract":"Abstract: Objective: To investigate the impact of sarcasm in analyzing the sentiments from tweets.\n\nDesign: \n1. The Tweets related to five different domains are collected from the Twitter by creating Twitter developer account.\n2. The Tweets are preprocessed in order to extract the features (Term Frequency, Entropy, Gain Ratio) from the Tweets.\n3. Proposed an Iterative algorithm in updating the dictionary with Negative Phrases and sentiment words.\n4. Assigned a polarity to each tweet using the Dictionary based approach.\n5. Tweets with Zero scores are detected as Sarcasm tweets.\n6. Analysis on Variance (AOV) Test is performed on the scores obtained.\n7. Perform prediction on the scores using Machine Learning Algorithms.\n8. Estimated the Mean Square Prediction Error (MSPE) using Cross Validation \n\nOutcome: The impact of sarcasm on sentiment analysis is measured in terms of Precision, Recall and F-score.","authors":["Muzamil Basha","Dharmendra Singh Rajput"],"meta":["May 2018Recent Patents on Computer Science 11(1)","DOI:10.2174/2213275911666180531112306","Project: Sentiment Analysis"],"references":["322735668_Impact_of_Gradient_Ascent_and_Boosting_Algorithm_in_Classification","320382081_A_Soft_Computing_Approach_to_Provide_Recommendation_on_PIMA_Diabetes","319534149_Comparative_Study_on_Performance_Analysis_of_Time_Series_Predictive_Models","319124993_Weighted_Fuzzy_Rule_Based_Sentiment_Prediction_Analysis_on_Tweets","311863138_A_novel_automatic_satire_and_irony_detection_using_ensembled_feature_selection_and_data_mining","301404378_Towards_a_Contextual_Pragmatic_Model_to_Detect_Irony_in_Tweets","315870286_A_Review_on_Sarcasm_Detection_from_Machine-Learning_Perspective","312638237_Abusive_Language_Detection_in_Online_User_Content","309705894_Sarcasm_detection_in_microblogs_using_Naive_Bayes_and_fuzzy_clustering","301845949_Automatic_Sarcasm_Detection_A_Survey","281240862_Parsing-based_Sarcasm_Sentiment_Recognition_in_Twitter_Data","265727227_SentiView_A_Visual_Sentiment_Analysis_Framework","263661940_Modelling_Sarcasm_in_Twitter_a_Novel_Approach","271548602_Indonesian_Social_Media_Sentiment_Analysis_With_Sarcasm_Detection","269302176_Polarity_detection_of_sarcastic_political_tweets"]}
