{"id":"333131048_Expert_System_of_Chili_Plant_Disease_Diagnosis_using_Forward_Chaining_Method_on_Android","abstract":"This research was conducted to make an expert system that is able to diagnose disease in chili plants based on knowledge that provided directly from the experts. This research uses classical probability calculation method in calculating the percentage of diagnoses and implemented on the Android mobile device. This research consisted of 37 symptoms data, 10 data of chili disease caused by fungi, and 10 rules. This expert system uses forward chaining inference method. Test results shows: (1) Functional testing using the Black Box Equivalence Partitioning (EP) method give the results as expected on the test scenario on each test class. (2) Expert testing by comparing the results of manual and system calculations matches and run well. (3) User acceptance test is done to 53 respondents which is divided into four groups of respondents. The first respondents group that is consisting of experts of chili disease give average score of 85.14% (excellent). The second group that consist of Agriculture Department students give score of 84.13% (excellent). The third respondent group that consist of Computer Science Department students give score of 84.28% (excellent) whereas the last group (chili farmers) give a score of 86% (excellent).","authors":["Aristoteles Aristoteles"],"meta":["May 2019","DOI:10.14569/IJACSA.2017.081121","Project: Expert System"],"references":[]}
