{"id":"238621672_Computer_Crime_Victimization_and_Integrated_Theory_An_Empirical_Assessment","abstract":"This study empirically assessed a computer-crime victimization model by applying Routine Activities Theory. Routine Activities Theory is arguably, as presented in detail in the main body of this study, merely an expansion of Hindelang, Gottfredson, and Garofalo's lifestyle-exposure theory. A self-report survey, which contained multiple measures of computer security, online lifestyles, and computer-crime victimization, was administered to 204 college students to gather data to test the model. Utilizing structural equation modeling facilitated the assessment of the new theoretical model by conveying an overall picture of the relationship among the causal factors in the proposed model. The findings from this study provided empirical supports for the components of Routine Activities Theory by delineating patterns of computer-crime victimization.","authors":["Kyung-Shick Choi"],"meta":["January 2008International Journal of Cyber Criminology 2(1)","Project: Cybercrime Project"],"references":["349859769_Cybercrime_Investigating_High-Technology_Computer_Crime","303919046_Principles_and_Practice_of_Structural_Equation_Modeling","288482834_Computer_crime_An_emerging_challenge_for_law_enforcement","285797889_2008_CSIFBI_computer_crime_and_security_survey","281154126_Bars_blocks_and_crimes_revisited_Linking_the_theory_of_routine_activities_to_the_empiricism_of_'hot_spots'","271685603_Social_Differentiation_in_Criminal_Victimization_A_Test_of_Routine_ActivitiesLifestyle_Theories","252721645_The_many_faces_of_the_Sun","249960523_THE_FORENSIC_CHALLENGES_OF_ECRIME","249683557_Property_Crime_and_the_Routine_Activities_of_Individuals","249570344_Developing_Policies_for_Cybercrime"]}
