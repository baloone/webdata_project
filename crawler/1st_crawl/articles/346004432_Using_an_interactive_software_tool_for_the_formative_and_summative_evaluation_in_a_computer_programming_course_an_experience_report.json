{"id":"346004432_Using_an_interactive_software_tool_for_the_formative_and_summative_evaluation_in_a_computer_programming_course_an_experience_report","abstract":"This article describes the use of an automatic tool that supports both formative and summative evaluation, in an introductory computer programming course. The aim was to test the tool in a real scenario and to assess its potential benefits. The participants were 56 students in an engineering school. Different programming tasks were solved by students with the support of the tool. It provides summative evaluation using automatic grading, and formative evaluation through real-time checking of good coding practices, code execution visualisation, testing code with custom inputs, informative feedback on failed test cases, and student performance statistics for self-monitoring the learning process. Results of the experience show the students considerably used the tool, denoting high engagement to achieve the learning goals of the tasks. The students perceived the tool was highly useful to debug programs and carry out frequent practice of programming, thanks to the automatic feedback and test of solutions for programming assignments. Results offer evidence of the importance of providing comprehensive feedback to facilitate students finding mistakes and building knowledge about how to proceed in case of errors. Moreover, the tool shows some potential to help students developing learning strategies, e.g. metacognitive awareness and improving problem-solving skills.","authors":["Felipe Restrepo-Calle","Jhon Jairo Ramirez Echeverry","Fabio A.
