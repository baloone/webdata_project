{"id":"304997478_Robust_aperiodic-disturbance_rejection_in_an_uncertain_modified_repetitive-control_system","abstract":"This paper concerns the problem of designing an EID-based robust output-feedback modified repetitive-control system (ROFMRCS) that provides satisfactory aperiodic-disturbance rejection performance for a class of plants with time-varying structured uncertainties. An equivalent-input-disturbance (EID) estimator is added to the ROFMRCS that estimates the influences of all types of disturbances and compensates them. A continuous-discrete two-dimensional model is built to describe the EID-based ROFMRCS that accurately presents the features of repetitive control, thereby enabling the control and learning actions to be preferentially adjusted. A robust stability condition for the closed-loop system is given in terms of a linear matrix inequality. It yields the parameters of the repetitive controller, the output-feedback controller, and the EID-estimator. Finally, a numerical example demonstrates the validity of the method.","authors":["Lan Zhou","Jinhua She","Chaoyi Li","Changzhong Pan"],"meta":["July 2016International Journal of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science 26(2)","DOI:10.1515/amcs-2016-0020"],"references":["273021668_Estimation_and_rejection_of_aperiodic_disturbance_in_a_modified_repetitive-control_system","267478360_A_2D_system_approach_to_the_design_of_a_robust_modified_repetitive-control_system_with_a_dynamic_output-feedback_controller","261768405_Aperiodic_Disturbance_Rejection_in_Repetitive-Control_Systems","287312074_Compensation_in_repetitive_control_system_for_aperiodic_disturbances_and_input_dead_zone","285538236_High_accuracy_control_magnet_power_supply_of_proton_synchrotron_in_recurrent_operation","270753130_Design_of_Robust_Modified_Repetitive-Control_System_for_Linear_Periodic_Plants","263391581_Robust_disturbance_rejection_in_modified_repetitive_control_system","256660720_Design_of_a_modified_repetitive-control_system_based_on_a_continuous-discrete_2D_model","251834556_Robust_Tracking_Control_of_Optical_Disk_Recording_System_based_on_Sudden_Disturbance_Observer","245322410_Robust_stabilization_for_a_class_of_discrete-time_non-linear_systems_via_output_feedback_The_unified_LMI_approach"]}
