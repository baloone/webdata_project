{"id":"322864005_Linking_BIM_and_Design_of_Experiments_to_balance_architectural_and_technical_design_factors_for_energy_performance","abstract":"To transform the existing energy systems towards renewable energy sources, buildings need to use less energy, use energy more efficiently and harness local renewable energy sources. For the design of energy-efficient buildings, building energy simulation of varying sophistication is commonly employed. Types of simulations range from simple, static calculations to sophisticated dynamic simulation. Especially for building retrofit many assumptions on construction, material etc. have to be taken, which increases the uncertainty of simulation results. In conjunction with simulation, methods of Building Performance Optimization are increasingly employed. They are able to identify best performing designs however do not provide insights on the mechanisms and interdependencies of the different design factors, which are most valuable to make informed design decisions. We present a methodology that aims to provide a better understanding and create knowledge about the influence and interactions of different architectural and technical design factors on building energy performance of a specific design task. For this purpose, we introduce Design of Experiments (DoE) in an integrated design workflow using the Design Performance Viewer (DPV) toolset, combining Building Information Modeling (BIM), distributed dynamic simulation and statistical analysis of the extensive simulation results. The experiments created using the methodology allow to identify the strength of effects and interactions of different design factors on selected performance indicators. We apply the methodology on an office retrofit case, introducing a factor scatterplot for result visualization, development and comparison of retrofit strategies. We further evaluate its potential to identify high performing strategies while balancing architectural and technical factors and their impact on energy performance.","authors":["Arno Schlueter","Philipp Geyer"],"meta":["February 2018Automation in Construction 86(3):33-43","DOI:10.1016/j.autcon.2017.10.021"],"references":["312941534_Service-oriented_architecture_for_data_exchange_between_a_building_information_model_and_a_building_energy_model","266617032_Multiscale_co-simulation_of_EnergyPlus_and_CitySim_models_derived_from_a_building_information_model","263547831_BIM-extracted_Energyplus_model_calibration_for_retrofit_analysis_of_a_historically_listed_building_in_Switzerland","261761576_Surgical_excision_of_radial_scars_diagnosed_by_core_biopsy_may_help_predict_future_risk_of_breast_cancer","243459063_A_Design_Method_for_Multicriteria_Optimization_of_Low_Exergy_Architecture","241736151_The_Coordinate-Exchange_Algorithm_for_Constructing_Exact_Optimal_Experimental_Designs","237151752_Assessing_Gaps_and_Needs_for_Integrating_Building_Performance_Optimization_Tools_in_Net_Zero_Energy_Buildings_Design","223114040_Energy_in_context_A_multicriteria_model_for_building_design","6155271_Box-Behnken_design_An_alternative_for_the_optimization_of_analytical_methods","4016079_An_investigation_of_the_applicability_of_design_of_experiments_to_software_testing","313767232_Performance-oriented_design_of_large_passive_solar_roofs","293104019_Reilly_M","276089103_Metamodeling_the_heating_and_cooling_energy_needs_and_simultaneous_building_envelope_optimization_for_low_energy_building_design_in_Morocco","267762955_Combined_use_of_design_of_experiment_and_dynamic_building_Simulation_in_assessment_of_energy_efficiency_in_tropical_residential_buildings","245170115_Performance_evaluation_of_passive_cooling_in_office_buildings_based_on_uncertainty_and_sensitivity_analysis","243459066_Facilitating_Environmental_Performance_Assessment_in_Architectural_Design_Competitions_utilizing_a_Model-based_Workflow","233474246_Development_and_performance_evaluation_of_a_methodology_based_on_distributed_computing_for_speeding_EnergyPlus_simulation","223816485_Applying_Multi-Objective_Genetic_Algorithms_in_Green_Building_Design_Optimization","223527166_A_new_methodology_for_the_disgn_of_low_energy_buildings","223364577_Fast_method_to_predict_building_heating_demand_based_on_the_design_of_experiments","223049306_Building_information_model_based_energyexergy_performance_assessment_in_early_design_stages","222659409_Application_of_sensitivity_analysis_in_design_of_sustainable_buildings","222490789_Building_Design_Advisor_Automated_integration_of_multiple_simulation_tools","222034554_A_design_optimization_tool_based_on_a_genetic_algorithm","30871150_An_evolutionary_system_for_design_exploration"]}
