{"id":"336708430_Accuracy_assessment_of_fusion_transcript_detection_via_read-mapping_and_de_novo_fusion_transcript_assembly-based_methods","abstract":"Background: \nAccurate fusion transcript detection is essential for comprehensive characterization of cancer transcriptomes. Over the last decade, multiple bioinformatic tools have been developed to predict fusions from RNA-seq, based on either read mapping or de novo fusion transcript assembly.\n\nResults: \nWe benchmark 23 different methods including applications we develop, STAR-Fusion and TrinityFusion, leveraging both simulated and real RNA-seq. Overall, STAR-Fusion, Arriba, and STAR-SEQR are the most accurate and fastest for fusion detection on cancer transcriptomes.\n\nConclusion: \nThe lower accuracy of de novo assembly-based methods notwithstanding, they are useful for reconstructing fusion isoforms and tumor viruses, both of which are important in cancer research.","authors":["Brian J Haas","Alexander Dobin","Bo Li","Nicolas Stransky"],"meta":["October 2019Genome Biology 20(1)","DOI:10.1186/s13059-019-1842-9"],"references":["345141150_Fusion_detection_and_quantification_by_pseudoalignment","344106683_FusionCatcher_-_a_tool_for_finding_somatic_fusion_genes_in_paired-end_RNA-sequencing_data","326083787_PO-400_Arriba_-_fast_and_accurate_gene_fusion_detection_from_rna-seq_data","324225055_Driver_Fusions_and_Their_Implications_in_the_Development_and_Treatment_of_Human_Cancers","323383641_STAR_Chimeric_Post_for_rapid_detection_of_circular_RNA_and_fusion_transcripts","318793554_GFusion_an_Effective_Algorithm_to_Identify_Fusion_Genes_from_Cancer_RNA-Seq_Data","317872926_UpSetR_An_R_Package_for_the_Visualization_of_Intersecting_Sets_and_their_Properties","328624748_Fusion_detection_and_quantification_by_pseudoalignment","327057008_The_Cancer_Cell_Line_Encyclopedia_enables_predictive_modelling_of_anticancer_drug_sensitivity","320888559_TumorFusions_An_integrative_resource_for_cancer-associated_transcript_fusions"]}
