{"id":"249797757_Mentoring_and_Undergraduate_Academic_Success_A_Literature_Review","abstract":"Despite a growing body of research about mentoring, definitional, theoretical, and methodological deficiencies reduce the usefulness of existing research. This article provides a critical review of the literature on mentoring, with an emphasis on the links between mentoring and undergraduate academic success. The first section describes a variety of ways in which mentoring has been defined within higher education, management, and psychology. Issues related to developing a standard operational definition of mentoring within higher education are discussed. The second section provides a critical review of empirical research about mentoring and undergraduate education. The third section describes four different theoretical perspectives that could be used in future research about mentoring. Finally, future directions for research, including methodological issues and substantive concerns, are addressed.","authors":["Maryann Jacobi"],"meta":["December 1991Review of Educational Research 61(4):505-532","DOI:10.3102/00346543061004505"],"references":["313421347_Mentoring_in_managerial_careers","248462214_Women_and_Mentoring_A_Review_and_Research_Agenda","236026224_Drop-Outs_From_Higher_Education_A_Theoretical_Synthesis_of_Recent_Research","348102604_College_Professors_and_Their_Impact_on_Students","313370995_A_Replication_of_a_Path_Analytic_Validation_of_Tinto's_Theory_of_College_Student_Attrition","313189025_The_effects_of_participation_in_a_mentoring-transcript_program_on_freshmen","313048425_Gender_issues_in_research_and_publication","312900327_Student_involvement_A_developmental_theory_for_higher_education","305166663_Dropout_from_Higher_Education_A_Theoretical_Synthesis_of_Recent_Research","291980244_Much_ado_about_mentors","288467056_Social_Learning_Theory","284484850_Moving_Up_Role_Models_Mentors_and_the_Patron_System","284297470_The_Role_of_Mentors_in_Developing_Leaders_for_Academe","274754561_Factor_Analytic_Support_for_Psychosocial_and_Motivational_Mentoring_Functions","272927430_The_Mentor_Connection","272541904_Influences_on_Students'_Perceptions_of_Their_Academic_Skill_Development_During_College","272178002_Student_Involvement_A_Developmental_Theory_for_Higher_Education","271688958_Mentorship_A_Career_Training_and_Development_Tool","270372706_Student-Faculty_Interactional_Settings_and_Their_Relationship_to_Predicted_Academic_Performance","270261304_The_Seasons_of_a_Man's_Life","270018291_College_Professors_and_Their_Impact_on_Students","269583628_College_The_Undergraduate_Experience_in_America","264771576_Career_Counseling_Black_Women_in_a_Predominantly_White_Coeducational_University","258183247_Student-Faculty_Informal_Contact_and_College_Outcomes","254074770_Mentors_and_Proteges_A_Critical_Review_of_the_Literature","250184664_Professors_as_Models_and_Mentors_for_College_Students","249106546_Role_Models_Mentors_and_Sponsors_The_Elusive_Concepts","248986427_THE_ROLE_OF_MENTORING_IN_THE_CAREER_DEVELOPMENT_OF_COMMUNITY_COLLEGE_PRESIDENTS","248468982_Job_Stress_and_Social_Support","247737903_Mentors_in_Organizations","247504433_Mentoring_Women_in_Academia","247124821_Patterns_of_Student-Faculty_Informal_Interaction_Beyond_the_Classroom_and_Voluntary_Freshman_Attrition","243544251_Forms_of_Intellectual_and_Ethical_Development_in_the_College_Years_A_Scheme","242529821_They're_not_dumb_they're","242400666_Men_and_Women_of_The_Corporation","240801789_Mentoring_in_Graduate_Schools_of_Education_Mentors'_Perceptions","238333656_Mentoring_and_Other_Communication_Support_in_the_Academic_Setting","234752478_Four_Critical_Years_Effects_of_College_Belie_Attitudes_and_Knowledge","234741809_Mentoring_An_Action_Strategy_for_Increasing_Minority_Faculty","234705365_The_Use_of_Mentors_for_Leadership_Development","234695397_Focus_Group_Research_A_Tool_for_the_Student_Affairs_Professional","234651187_Mentoring_An_Age_Old_Practice_in_a_Knowledge-Based_Society","234632708_The_Mentor_Partnership_Discovery_of_Professionalism","234626121_Research_Methodologies_for_Assessing_Mentoring","234603179_Faculty_Mentoring_System_for_Minority_Student_Retention_Year_End_Report_1986-87_Educational_Year","234601800_Education_and_Identity_Revisited","234583952_The_Black_Freshman_Network","234568144_College_The_Undergraduate_Experience_in_America","234021315_Social_Learning_Theoy","233897157_The_Childhood_and_Society","232576554_Toward_generative_theory","232579934_Keeping_LD_Students_in_College","232575626_Differences_in_female_graduate_students_in_relation_to_mentoring","232548976_Forms_of_Intellectual_and_Ethical_Development_in_the_College_Years","232547642_Developmental_Factors_Associated_with_Self-Perceptions_of_Mentoring_Competence_and_Mentoring_Needs"]}
