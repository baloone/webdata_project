{"id":"8657113_A_genetic_algorithm_for_the_detection_of_new_cis-regulatory_modules_in_sets_of_coregulated_genes","abstract":"The implementation of a genetic algorithm is described that provides a fast method of searching for the optimal combination of transcription factor binding sites in a set of regulatory sequences.\n\nAvailability: \nThe algorithm can be used transparently as a web service from within the Toucan software. Toucan can be accessed at http://www.esat.kuleuven.ac.be/~saerts/software/toucan.php. A standalone version of the software is available upon request.","authors":["Stein Aerts","Peter Van Loo","Yves Moreau","Bart L.R.
