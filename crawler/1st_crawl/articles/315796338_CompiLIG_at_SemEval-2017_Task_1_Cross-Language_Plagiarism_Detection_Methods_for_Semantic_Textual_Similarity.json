{"id":"315796338_CompiLIG_at_SemEval-2017_Task_1_Cross-Language_Plagiarism_Detection_Methods_for_Semantic_Textual_Similarity","abstract":"We present our submitted systems for Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) Track 4 at SemEval-2017. Given a pair of Spanish-English sentences, each system must estimate their semantic similarity by a score between 0 and 5. In our submission, we use syntax-based, dictionary-based, context-based, and MT-based methods. We also combine these methods in unsupervised and supervised way. Our best run ranked 1st on track 4a with a correlation of 83.02% with human annotations.","authors":["Jérémy Ferrero","Frederic Agnes","Laurent Besacier","Didier Schwab"],"meta":["August 2017","DOI:10.18653/v1/S17-2012","Conference: International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2017); colocated with ACL 2017At: Vancouver, Canada","Project: Plagiarism detection"],"references":["318084717_SemEval-2017_Task_1_Semantic_Textual_Similarity_-_Multilingual_and_Cross-lingual_Focused_Evaluation","313642462_Using_Word_Embedding_for_Cross-Language_Plagiarism_Detection","305334510_SemEval-2016_Task_1_Semantic_Textual_Similarity_Monolingual_and_Cross-Lingual_Evaluation","304138841_UWB_at_SemEval-2016_Task_1_Semantic_Textual_Similarity_using_Lexical_Syntactic_and_Semantic_Information","301861882_A_Multilingual_Multi-Style_and_Multi-Granularity_Dataset_for_Cross-Language_Textual_Similarity_Detection","301446160_DLSCU_Sentence_Similarity_from_Word_Alignment_and_Semantic_Vector_Composition","277903702_DBnary_Wiktionary_as_a_Lemon-Based_Multilingual_Lexical_Resource_in_RDF","225146236_Cross-Language_plagiarism_detection","309074560_Scoring_term_weighting_and_the_vector_space_model","267242933_Cross-Language_High_Similarity_Search_Using_a_Conceptual_Thesaurus"]}
