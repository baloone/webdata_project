{"id":"303902034_Mining_Advisor-Advisee_Relationships_in_Scholarly_Big_Data_A_Deep_Learning_Approach","abstract":"Mining advisor-advisee relationships can benefit many interesting applications such as advisor recommendation and protege performance analysis. Based on the hypothesis that, advisor-advisee relationships among researchers are hidden in scholarly big data, we propose in this work a deep learning based advisor-advisee relationship identification method which considers the personal properties and network characteristics with a stacked autoencoder model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a deep learning model is utilized to represent coauthor network features for relationships identification. Moreover, experiments demonstrate that the proposed method has better performance compared with other state-of-the-art methods.","authors":["Wei Wang","Jiaying Liu","Shuo Yu","Chenxin Zhang"],"meta":["June 2016","DOI:10.1145/2910896.2925435","Conference: the 16th ACM/IEEE-CS"],"references":["44646839_The_role_of_mentorship_in_protege_performance","221654673_Mining_advisor-advisee_relationships_from_research_publication_networks"]}
