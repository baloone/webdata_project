{"id":"303281173_Cumulative_Activation_in_Social_Networks","abstract":"Usually a customer make the decision to buy a product if she/he is cumulatively impacted by enough pieces of information for the product. In this paper we use the classical independent cascade model in social network to model the information diffusion. In this model, the active probability of a node can be regarded as the frequency of a customer receiving information after multiple information diffusion. In this work we study a new type of activation named cumulative activation. A node is cumulatively active if its active probability is beyond a given threshold. Two optimization problems are investigated under this framework: seed minimization with cumulative activation (SM-CA) problem, which asks how to select a seed set with minimum size such that the number of cumulatively active nodes can reach a given threshold; influence maximization with cumulative activation (IM-CA) problem, which asks how to choose a seed set with a fixed budget to maximize the number of cumulatively active nodes. For SM-CA problem, we design a greedy algorithm which yields a bicriteria $O(\\ln n)$-approximation when $\\eta=n$, here $\\eta$ is the given threshold and $n$ is the number of nodes in the network. For $\\eta<n$, we show an $\\Omega(n^\\delta)$-inapproximate result under a wildly believed hardness assumption of the densest $k$-subgraph problem. For IM-CA problem, we prove that it is NP-hard to approximate the problem within $n^{1-\\varepsilon}$ for any $\\varepsilon>0$. What's more, we provide two efficient heuristic algorithms for SM-CA and IM-CA respectively. Experiments results on different real-world social networks show that our heuristic algorithms outperform many previous algorithms.","authors":["Xiaohan Shan","Wei Chen","Qiang Li","Xiaoming Sun"],"meta":["May 2016Sciece China.
