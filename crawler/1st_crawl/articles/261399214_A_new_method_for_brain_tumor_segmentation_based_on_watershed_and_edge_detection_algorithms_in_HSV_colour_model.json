For this purpose watershed method is used in combination with edge detection operation. It is a color based brain tumor detection algorithm using color brain MRI images in HSV color space. The RGB image is converted to HSV color image by which the image is separated in three regions hue, saturation, and intensity. After contrast enhancement watershed algorithm is applied to the image for each region. Canny edge detector is applied to the output image. After combining the three images final brain tumor segmented image is obtained. The algorithm has been applied on twenty brain MRI images. The developed algorithm has given promising results.","authors":["Ishita Maiti","Monisha Chakraborty"],"meta":["November 2012","DOI:10.1109/NCCCS.2012.6413020","Conference: Computing and Communication Systems (NCCCS), 2012 National Conference on"],"references":["260320597_Performance_Evaluation_of_Standard_Image_Segmentation_Methods_and_Clustering_Algorithms_for_Segmentation_of_MRI_Brain_Tumor_Images","220849754_Segmentation_and_Characterization_of_Brain_Tumor_from_MR_Images","3970321_Segmentation_and_histogram_generation_using_the_HSV_color_space_for_image_retrieval","274140029_A_New_Approach_for_Image_Segmentation_using_Pillar-Kmeans_Algorithm","235890195_Digital_Image_Processing","222821660_Image_segmentation_by_histogram_thresholding_using_hierarchical_cluster_analysis","221186817_Extracting_Color_Using_Adaptive_Segmentation_for_Image_Retrieval","220690339_Digital_Image_Process"]}
