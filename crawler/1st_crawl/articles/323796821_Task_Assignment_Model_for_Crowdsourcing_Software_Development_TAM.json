{"id":"323796821_Task_Assignment_Model_for_Crowdsourcing_Software_Development_TAM","abstract":"Selection of a suitable task from the extensively available large set of tasks is an intricate job for the developers in crowdsourcing software development (CSD). Besides, it is also a tiring and a time-consuming job for the platform to evaluate thousands of tasks submitted by developers. Previous studies stated that managerial and technical aspects have prime importance in bringing success for software development projects, however, these two aspects can be more effective and conducive if combined with human aspects. The main purpose of this paper is to present a conceptual framework for task assignment model for future research on the basis of personality types, that will provide a basic structure for CSD workers to find suitable tasks and also a platform to assign the task directly. This will also match their personality and task. Because personality is an internal force which whittles the behavior of developers. Consequently, this research presented a Task Assignment Model (TAM) from a developers point of view, moreover, it will also provide an opportunity to the platform to assign a task to CSD workers according to their personality types directly.","authors":["Muhammad Zahid Tunio","Haiyong Luo","Wang Cong","Fang Zhao"],"meta":["March 2018Journal of Information Processing Systems 14(3):621-630","DOI:10.3745/JIPS.04.0064","Project: School of Software Engineering"],"references":["323571929_Crowdsourcing_Software_Development_Task_Assignment_Using_PDDL_Artificial_Intelligence_Planning","319525771_Impact_of_Personality_on_Task_Selection_in_Crowdsourcing_Software_Development_A_Sorting_Approach","313617892_Towards_task_recommendation_in_micro-task_markets","308826482_A_Vision_of_Crowd_Development","308361622_Developer_Recommendation_for_Crowdsourced_Software_Development_Tasks","308344201_A_Survey_of_the_Use_of_Crowdsourcing_in_Software_Engineering","303323751_Task_allocation_for_crowdsourcing_using_AI_planning","296307849_A_Rule-Based_Model_for_Software_Development_Team_Composition_Team_Leader_Role_with_Personality_Types_and_Gender_Classification","288855909_Crowdsourcing_in_Software_Engineering_Models_Motivations_and_Challenges","285449708_STWM_A_Solution_to_Self-adaptive_Task-Worker_Matching_in_Software_Crowdsourcing"]}
