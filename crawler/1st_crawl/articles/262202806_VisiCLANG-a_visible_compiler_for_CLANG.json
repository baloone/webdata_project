{"id":"262202806_VisiCLANG-a_visible_compiler_for_CLANG","abstract":"This paper describes a visible compiler for the CLANG language. VisiCLANG shows on-screen, in various text windows, all aspects of the CLANG compiler as it compiles and executes a user's program. This allows someone who is learning the techniques of compiler construction to see the inner workings of a simple recursive-descent compiler.","authors":["Dan Resler"],"meta":["August 1990ACM SIGPLAN Notices 25(8):120-123","DOI:10.1145/87416.87483","Sourcedoi.acm.org"],"references":["234830019_CLANG_-_a_simple_teaching_language","234793698_Design_and_Implementation_of_the_UW_Illustrated_Compiler"]}
