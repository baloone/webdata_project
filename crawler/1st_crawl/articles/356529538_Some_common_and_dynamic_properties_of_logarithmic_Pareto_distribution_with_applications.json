{"id":"356529538_Some_common_and_dynamic_properties_of_logarithmic_Pareto_distribution_with_applications","abstract":"The Pareto distribution satisfies the power law, which is widely used in physics, biology, earth and planetary sciences, economics, finance, computer science, and many other fields. In this article, the logarithmic Pareto distribution, a logarithmic transformation of the Pareto distribution, is presented and studied. The moments, percentiles, skewness, kurtosis, and some dynamic measures such as hazard rate, mean residual life, and quantile residual life are discussed. The parameters were estimated by quantile and maximum likelihood methods. A simulation study was conducted to investigate the efficiency, consistency, and behavior of the maximum likelihood estimator. Finally, the proposed distribution was fitted to some datasets to show its usefulness.","authors":["Mohamed Kayid"],"meta":["November 2021Open Physics 19(1):669-678","DOI:10.1515/phys-2021-0082"],"references":["346476961_adocumentclass12ptminimal_usepackageamsmath_usepackagewasysym_usepackageamsfonts_usepackageamssymb_usepackageamsbsy_usepackagemathrsfs_usepackageupgreek_setlengthoddsidemargin-69pt_begindocumentalpha_","340324099_Marshall-Olkin_Generalized_Pareto_Distribution_Bayesian_and_Non_Bayesian_Estimation","333742511_Alpha-Power_Pareto_distribution_Its_properties_and_applications","322994572_A_New_Generalization_of_the_Pareto_Distribution_and_Its_Application_to_Insurance_Data","280125764_The_Gumbel-Lomax_Distribution_Properties_and_Applications","277944026_An_Extended_Pareto_Distribution","321434933_A_New_Extension_of_Weibull_Distribution_Properties_and_Different_Methods_of_Estimation","316482986_Alpha_Logarithmic_Transformed_Family_of_Distributions_with_Application","285475346_Power_laws_Pareto_distributions_and_Zipfs_law","280757583_Highly_optimized_tolerance_A_mechanism_for_power_laws_in_designed_systems","263801375_Upper-truncated_power_law_distributions","258387317_A_Family_of_Lifetime_Distributions","274176967_A_new_method_for_adding_a_parameter_to_a_family_of_distributions_with_application_to_the_exponential_and_Weibull_families","254331463_Theoretical_Explanation_of_Observed_Decreasing_Failure_Rate","233429092_A_generalization_of_the_compound_Rayleigh_distribution_Using_a_Bayesian_method_on_cancer_survival_times"]}
