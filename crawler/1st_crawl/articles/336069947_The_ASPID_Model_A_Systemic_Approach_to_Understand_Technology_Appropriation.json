{"id":"336069947_The_ASPID_Model_A_Systemic_Approach_to_Understand_Technology_Appropriation","abstract":"The ASPID model (Adoption, Substitution, Progress, Innovation, Deterioration) is an interpretive framework that allows a systemic understanding of how technologies are adopted and integrated in physical education (PE). The ASPID model was inspired by ten years of research work with over 50,000 teachers and athletes. The ASPID model also implies that technology integration in the classroom is not necessarily smooth sailing. Both teachers and students can progress through the different ASPID phases. A successful technology-assisted approach requires a good understanding of these phases.","authors":["Thierry Karsenti","Julien Bugmann"],"meta":["September 2019"],"references":["273634447_Pratique_et_profils_d'utilisation_des_TICE_chez_les_enseignants_d'une_universite","267544377_TIC_technologies_emergentes_et_Web_20_quels_impacts_en_education","220259897_User_Acceptance_of_Information_Technology_Toward_a_Unified_View","285206824_Le_modele_ASPID_modeliser_le_processus_d'adoption_et_d'integration_pedagogique_des_technologies_en_contexte_educatif","266672780_Avantages_et_defis_inherents_a_l'usage_des_ordinateurs_portables_au_primaire_et_au_secondaire","257252913_Teacher_adoption_of_technology","237329250_Oversold_and_Underused_Computers_in_the_Classroom","228021141_Investigating_the_impact_of_laptops_on_students'_learning_using_Bloom's_learning_taxonomy","220041541_Technological_Pedagogical_Content_Knowledge_A_Framework_for_Teacher_Knowledge"]}
