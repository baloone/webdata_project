{"id":"317171639_Design_for_Additive_Manufacturing","abstract":"As AM technologies become increasingly recognized, manufacturing industries have started to consider AM as one of the enabling technologies that will transform the paradigm of manufacturing. In aerospace industries, companies have embraced AM in the belief that it will become critical to their competitiveness. In biomedicine industries, AM is considered to be the most promising manufacturing technology to achieve customized medicine and treatment in the future. In addition, with digitalized information exchange and process management, AM is also regarded integral to the so-called “Industry 4.0” revolution, which enables intelligent and agile manufacturing via the integration with various tools including internet of things and machine–human connectivity and interactions.","authors":["Li Yang","Keng Hsu","Brian Baughman","Donald Godfrey"],"meta":["May
