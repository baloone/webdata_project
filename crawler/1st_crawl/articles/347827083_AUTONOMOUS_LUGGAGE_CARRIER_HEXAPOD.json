{"id":"347827083_AUTONOMOUS_LUGGAGE_CARRIER_HEXAPOD","abstract":"In the last few years, there has been a lot of advancements in Robotics and Computer Science, to an extent that Robotic Devices are now included in our daily life and help us in our day to day activities. The more important thing is that this is not the peak, this is just the beginning, there is a lot of research going on in this field with the aim of making our quality of life better. This paper presents a similar project undertaken to help elderly people in carrying their luggage around the airport terminal. This paper presents the methodology and algorithms used to develop the device. The prototype has been tested in open spaces, while simulations have been done to analyze its scalability to accommodate multiple robots coexisting.","authors":["Vaibhav Malhotra"],"meta":["December 2020","DOI:10.33564/IJEAST.2020.v05i07.015"],"references":["340893960_YOLO_v3-Tiny_Object_Detection_and_Recognition_using_one_stage_improved_model","327408779_A_Bioinspired_Gait_Transition_Model_for_a_Hexapod_Robot","325984619_A_Hexapod_Robot_with_Non-Collocated_Actuators","321478845_Live_video_monitoring_robot_controlled_by_web_over_internet","265295439_ImageNet_Large_Scale_Visual_Recognition_Challenge","221907923_Locomotion_Analysis_of_Hexapod_Robot","311609522_You_Only_Look_Once_Unified_Real-Time_Object_Detection","304290829_Design_construction_and_control_of_hexapod_walking_robot"]}
