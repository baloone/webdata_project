{"id":"349390620_Research_on_Computer_Weiqi_Game_based_on_Mathematical_Model","abstract":"In recent years, computer hardware and software, even the Internet have developed rapidly, at the same time, the related disciplines are also making progress. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been a hot topic for a long time, and computer game is one of the research directions. As one of the most complex game projects, the challenging Go game can fully test the development level of artificial intelligence. Therefore, the study of computer Go game plays an important role in computer games, artificial intelligence and even computer science. Because it is inconvenient to generalize the knowledge rules of Weiqi and the search space is too large, the traditional computer game theories and methods are not applicable at present. In recent years, on the basis of the great improvement of computer performance, the computer Go game adopts the Monte Carlo method for dynamic evaluation, and introduces the upper bound confidence circle application tree algorithm, the search efficiency and evaluation performance have been greatly improved, and the level of computer Go game program has been constantly improved. At the same time, this clustering intelligent computing method is not only applicable to Go, but also applicable to planning and decision problems. Many problems, so the computer Weiqi Boben research results have important practical significance, can have a broader field of use.","authors":["Li Zuo","Fengtai Mei"],"meta":["February 2021Journal of Physics Conference Series 1744(3):032146","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/1744/3/032146"],"references":["224396569_The_Computational_Intelligence_of_MoGo_Revealed_in_Taiwan's_Computer_Go_Tournaments"]}
