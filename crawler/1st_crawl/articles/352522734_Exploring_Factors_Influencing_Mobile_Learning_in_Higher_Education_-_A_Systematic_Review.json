{"id":"352522734_Exploring_Factors_Influencing_Mobile_Learning_in_Higher_Education_-_A_Systematic_Review","abstract":"In order to facilitate effective learning experiences for the students, mobile learning (m-learning) has evolved as a powerful component of education â€“ learning and teaching. M-learning, as opposed to electronic learning (e-learning) which uses small and portable devices along with laptops and desktops, uses mostly small and portable technological tools. M-learning assists in imparting knowledge focusing on the need of the learner, accessibility, infrastructure, and interaction, irrespective of the place and time. With rapid advancements in Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and mobile devices, myriad applications (apps) and innovative m-learning and e-learning services are being developed and launched at an unprecedented pace. For students representing different demographics (age, education level, class, socioeconomic status, location, etc.) and enrolled in higher education, m-learning has quickly become the modern style and preferred format of learning and accessing knowledge for its ease of integrating different modes of learning. Motivated by this novel m-learning learning movement, this study synthesizes existing research on m-learning technologies, technological platforms that cater to both synchronous and asynchronous learning/teaching modalities for students and teachers at institutions of higher education.","authors":["Yuvika Gupta","Farheen Mujeeb Khan","Sonal Agarwal"],"meta":["June 2021International Journal of Interactive Mobile Technologies (iJIM) 15(12):140","DOI:10.3991/ijim.v15i12.22503"],"references":["340934412_Exploring_factors_affecting_academics'_adoption_of_emerging_mobile_technologies-an_extended_UTAUT_perspective","340175620_Acceptance_of_mobile_phone_by_university_students_for_their_studies_an_investigation_applying_UTAUT2_model","340123263_Adoption_of_mobile_applications_for_teaching-learning_process_in_rural_girls'_schools_in_India_an_empirical_study","347895529_Tools_for_evaluating_educational_apps_for_young_children_a_systematic_review_of_the_literature","342694805_Predicting_the_intention_to_use_and_hedonic_motivation_for_mobile_learning_A_comparative_study_in_two_Middle_Eastern_countries","342172333_Medical_students'_attitudes_and_perceptions_towards_the_effectiveness_of_mobile_learning_A_comparative_information-need_perspective","339558277_Towards_a_conceptual_model_for_examining_the_impact_of_knowledge_management_factors_on_mobile_learning_acceptance","338646528_Tablets_and_apps_for_promoting_robotics_mathematics_STEM_education_and_literacy_in_early_childhood_education","337469028_Understanding_higher_education_learners'_acceptance_and_use_of_mobile_devices_for_language_learning_A_Rasch-based_path_modeling_approach","337464833_A_Research_Synthesis_of_the_Real_Value_of_Self-Proclaimed_Mobile_Educational_Applications_for_Young_Children"]}
