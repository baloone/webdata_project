{"id":"340557581_Dense_coding_capacity_of_a_quantum_channel","abstract":"We consider the fundamental protocol of dense coding of classical information assuming that noise affects both the forward and backward communication lines between Alice and Bob. Assuming that this noise is described by the same quantum channel, we define its dense coding capacity by optimizing over all adaptive strategies that Alice can implement, while Bob encodes the information by means of Pauli operators. Exploiting techniques of channel simulation and protocol stretching, we are able to establish the dense coding capacity of Pauli channels in arbitrary finite dimension, with simple formulas for depolarizing and dephasing qubit channels.","authors":["Riccardo Laurenza","Cosmo Lupo","Seth Lloyd","Stefano Pirandola"],"meta":["April 2020Physical Review Research 2(2)","DOI:10.1103/PhysRevResearch.2.023023"],"references":["336744162_Quantum_supremacy_using_a_programmable_superconducting_processor","329247994_Advances_in_photonic_quantum_sensing","321936282_Channel_Simulation_in_Quantum_Metrology","321347744_Theory_of_channel_simulation_and_bounds_for_private_communication","316489767_Fundamental_limits_of_repeaterless_quantum_communications","277560557_Advances_in_Quantum_Teleportation","338032086_Boson_Sampling_with_20_Input_Photons_and_a_60-Mode_Interferometer_in_a_1_0_14_-Dimensional_Hilbert_Space","334597099_Quantum_Systems_Channels_Information_A_Mathematical_Introduction","325200878_The_Theory_of_Quantum_Information","323722809_Quantum_Supremacy_and_the_Complexity_of_Random_Circuit_Sampling"]}
