{"id":"257520073_Reliability_analysis_of_stiffened_tank-roof_stability_with_multiple_random_variables_using_minimum_distance_and_Lagrange_methods","abstract":"Based on the reliability and buckling analysis of the steel tanks with a stiffened dome-roof, a mathematical model with multiple random variables was established and a new method for calculating and analysing the reliability and stability of the tank-roof by minimum distance and Lagrange formulae is provided. The analysis result of the tank as an engineering example by the proposed method shows that the thickness of both dome-roof-plates and stiffened ribs would affect the reliability of the tank-roof under different external loads. It is demonstrated that decisive factors affecting tank-roof reliability may be analysed such as: material thickness and external load. A reliability assessment is also needed performed to prove the correctness of both model and method. The assessment results were consistent with those from the engineering example. A baseline, reference method, for tank design and operation is thus proposed.","authors":["Wang He","Li-Chuan Liu","Ji-Ping Yang"],"meta":["September 2013Engineering Failure Analysis 32:304â€“311","DOI:10.1016/j.engfailanal.2013.04.002"],"references":["292798021_Stability_analysis_of_the_oil_storage_tank_roof","248204863_A_hierarchical_genetic_algorithm_for_reliability_based_design_of_geometrically_non-linear_composite_structures","241080885_Reliability_based_optimization_of_laminated_composite_structures_using_genetic_algorithms_and_Artificial_Neural_Networks","239343941_Buckling_behaviour_of_elliptical_cylindrical_shells_and_tubes_under_compression","222698115_Buckling_and_ultimate_strength_criteria_of_stiffened_shells_under_combined_loading_for_reliability_analysis","222215700_Buckling_strength_of_GFRP_under-water_vehicles"]}
