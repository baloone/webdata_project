{"id":"317487399_Distributed_Automatic_Differentiation_for_Ptychography","abstract":"Synchrotron radiation light source facilities are leading the way to ultrahigh resolution X-ray imaging. High resolution imaging is essential to understanding the fundamental structure and interaction of materials at the smallest length scale possible. Diffraction based methods achieve nanoscale imaging by replacing traditional objective lenses by pixelated area detectors and computational image reconstruction. Among these methods, ptychography is quickly becoming the standard for sub-30 nanometer imaging of extended samples, but at the expense of increasingly high data rates and volumes.","authors":["Youssef S.
