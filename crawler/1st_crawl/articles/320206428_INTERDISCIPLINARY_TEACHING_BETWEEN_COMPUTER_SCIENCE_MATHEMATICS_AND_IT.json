{"id":"320206428_INTERDISCIPLINARY_TEACHING_BETWEEN_COMPUTER_SCIENCE_MATHEMATICS_AND_IT","abstract":"Computer Science is one of the sciences that forms the understanding of the unified nature of information processes in the world around us. Information and communication technologies give us some new and powerful means of solving problems that are applicable in all scientific disciplines. Due to the fact that the methods and the tools of informatics and IT have become widely spread in many areas of human activity, the tasks solved during informatics and IT classes have a clearly defined interdisciplinary character. On the other hand, changes in the structure of motives in computer science studies over the last few years and the rapidly changing technologies both lead to the necessity of searching for different ways and pedagogical strategies to increase student motivation. The development of the cognitive motivation of the students is influenced by various factors, including the particularities of the various subjects.In this research, we present an approach for Interdisciplinary teaching between computer science, mathematics and Information technology.","authors":["Petyo Pavlov","Todorka Terzieva","Asen Rahnev"],"meta":["August 2017","DOI:10.26883/2010.171.285"],"references":["313581856_Automatic_generation_of_English_language_test_questions_on_parts_of_speech","232591024_Positive_Classroom_Motivational_Environments_Convergence_Between_Mastery_Goal_Structure_and_Classroom_Social_Climate"]}
