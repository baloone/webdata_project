{"id":"327387603_Player_Behavior_and_Personality_Modeling_for_Interactive_Storytelling_in_Games","abstract":"Current video games use simple methods to deal with interactive narratives and the enormous variety of player types. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to interactive storytelling in games, in which the quests and the ongoing story are determined in view of individual personality traits and behavioral attitudes in a nondeterministic way. Our method starts the process employing a new technique to assess the player's personality traits according to the well-known Big Five model. These traits are then used by a nondeterministic planning algorithm to define adaptive goal hierarchies. In addition, an artificial neural network is trained to predict player behaviors in real-time, allowing partial-order planning operators to use player behaviors and personality traits as logical terms in their preconditions. With this approach, a richer individualized experience is provided to the player, while preserving consistency with the conventions of the chosen genre.","authors":["Edirlei Soares de Lima","Bruno Feij√≥","Antonio L.
