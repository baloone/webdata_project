{"id":"334113505_Study_of_Uncertainties_and_Objective_Function_Modeling_Effects_on_Probabilistic_Optimization_Results","abstract":"In this work, we study the effect of uncertainties modeling and the choice of objective function on the results of\noptimization design problems in deterministic and probabilistic contexts. Uncertainties modeling are studied in two\ncases identified in the literature. The results show how the choice of two different objective functions which lead to\nthe same results in deterministic case may lead to opposite results in probabilistic case. Also, the results show how\nthe uncertainties modeling type can affect the antagonism between mean and standard deviation in the reliability\nbased robust design optimization problems. Three mechanical applications chosen from the literature are used to\nillustrate these cases.","authors":["Oussama Braydi","Pascal Lafon","Rafic Younes"],"meta":["June 2019ASCE-ASME J Risk and Uncert in Engrg Sys Part B Mech Engrg 5(4)","DOI:10.1115/1.4044152","Project: Global framework of optimization in probabilistic context for mechanical engineering"],"references":["327108243_A_New_Hybrid_Method_to_Solve_the_Multi-objective_Optimization_Problem_for_a_Composite_Hat-Stiffened_Panel","325795691_Reliability_based_optimization_of_a_hat_stiffened_panel","325792157_On_the_formulation_of_optimization_problems_under_uncertainty_in_mechanical_design","324543178_On_the_influence_of_uncertainties_modeling_on_reliability_based_robust_design_optimization_in_mechanical_engineering","308031060_Sequential_improvement_for_robust_optimization_using_an_uncertainty_measure_for_radial_basis_functions","288591680_Optimisation_of_Breakwaters_Design_to_Protect_Offshore_Terminal_Area","322777049_Sensitivity_analysis_methods_for_mitigating_uncertainty_in_engineering_system_design","322310136_Model_Uncertainty_A_Challenge_in_Nonlinear_Coupled_Multidisciplinary_System_Design","307869502_On_the_consideration_of_uncertainty_in_design_optimization_-_reliability_-_robustness","305312795_Robustness_Metrics_Consolidating_the_Multiple_Approaches_to_Quantify_Robustness"]}
