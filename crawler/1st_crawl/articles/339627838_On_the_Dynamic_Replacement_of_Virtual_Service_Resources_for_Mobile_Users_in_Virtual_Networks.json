{"id":"339627838_On_the_Dynamic_Replacement_of_Virtual_Service_Resources_for_Mobile_Users_in_Virtual_Networks","abstract":"In virtual networks, network traffic is managed through the resources of a substrate network. When users move from one access point to another, the traffic that is generated increases in variation, and the virtual service resources within each virtual network must be maintained at an acceptable quality of service (Qos). However, the resources that are offered by this virtual service resource may become insufficient to manage this traffic, harming the QoS. In this paper, we propose a virtual service resource replacement method that consists of migrating a service from one virtual node to another, offering sufficient resources to provide a good QoS when the traffic changes. Our method improves those of the literature by dealing with the cases of equal traffic weight at the node level and the service migration strategy. Our approach reduces the service migration time and the number of virtual service resource replacements compared to those of the literature.","authors":["Jean Frédéric Myoupo","Yannick Florian Yankam","Vianney Kengne Tchendji"],"meta":["March 2020Journal of Computers 15(1):10-21","DOI:10.17706/jcp.15.1.10-21"],"references":["316116116_Generalized_Recovery_From_Node_Failure_in_Virtual_Network_Embedding","280371898_VM_Migration_A_Survey","228735118_Survey_of_Virtual_Machine_Migration_Techniques","224569153_Network_Virtualization_State_of_the_Art_and_Research_Challenges","338579090_Dynamic_Replacement_of_Virtual_Service_Resources_Based_on_Tree_Topology_for_Mobile_Users_in_Virtual_Networks","324435292_Allocation_dynamique_des_ressources_et_gestion_de_la_qualite_de_service_dans_la_virtualisation_des_reseaux","311738024_Ordonnancement_des_migrations_a_chaud_de_machines_virtuelles","266660087_SDN-based_Live_VM_Migration_Across_Datacenters","261203841_A_restoration_scheme_for_virtual_networks_using_switches","221202184_Live_and_Incremental_Whole-System_Migration_of_Virtual_Machines_Using_Block-Bitmap"]}
