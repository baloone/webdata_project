{"id":"333338631_Resource_semantics_logic_as_a_modelling_technology","abstract":"The Logic of Bunched Implications (BI) was introduced by O'Hearn and Pym. The original presentation of BI emphasised its role as a system for formal logic (broadly in the tradition of relevant logic) that has some interesting properties, combining a clean proof theory, including a categorical interpretation, with a simple truth-functional semantics. BI quickly found significant applications in program verification and program analysis, chiefly through a specific theory of BI that is commonly known as 'Separation Logic'. We survey the state of work in bunched logics - which, by now, is a quite large family of systems, including modal and epistemic logics and logics for layered graphs - in such a way as to organize the ideas into a coherent (semantic) picture with a strong interpretation in terms of resources. One such picture can be seen as deriving from an interpretation of BI's semantics in terms of resources, and this view provides a basis for a systematic interpretation of the family of bunched logics, including modal, epistemic, layered graph, and process-theoretic variants, in terms of resources. We explain the basic ideas of resource semantics, including comparisons with Linear Logic and ideas from economics and physics. We include discussions of BI's Î»-calculus, of Separation Logic, and of an approach to distributed systems modelling based on resource semantics.","authors":["David Pym"],"meta":["April 2019ACM SIGLOG News 6(2)","DOI:10.1145/3326938.3326940"],"references":["325299198_Why_Separation_Logic_Works","324575475_A_Stone-type_Duality_Theorem_for_Separation_Logic_Via_its_Underlying_Bunched_Logics","320289789_Distributive_Residuated_Frames_and_Generalized_Bunched_Implication_Algebras","302059548_A_Logic_of_Separating_Modalities","282977854_Modelling_and_Simulating_Systems_Security_Policy","267654307_The_finite_embeddability_property_for_residuated_groupoids","257142871_Multilayer_Networks","235626322_A_Survey_of_Residuated_Lattices","345715007_Concurrent_separation_logic","345149992_Entailment_Vol_II_The_Logic_of_Relevance_and_Necessity","334250347_Bunched_logics_a_uniform_approach","330717475_Separation_Logic","319394252_Introduction_to_Higher-Order_Categorical_Logic","313857563_Intuitionistic_Layered_Graph_Logic_Semantics_and_Proof_Theory","313348029_BiLog_Spatial_Logics_for_Bigraphs","311365227_A_Substructural_Epistemic_Resource_Logic","303913048_Intuitionistic_Layered_Graph_Logic","302216331_A_Modal_BI_Logic_for_Dynamic_Resource_Properties","302200675_Remarks_on_natural_deduction_Koninklijke_Nederlandse_Akademie_van_Wetenschappen","301882324_Resource-distribution_via_Boolean_constraints","298809434_A_calculus_and_logic_of_bunched_resources_and_processes","283967069_Resource_convertibility_and_ordered_commutative_monoids","282926793_Iris_Monoids_and_Invariants_as_an_Orthogonal_Basis_for_Concurrent_Reasoning","281425897_Layered_graph_logic_as_an_assertion_language_for_access_control_policy_models","281390706_A_Modal_Separation_Logic_for_Resource_Dynamics","275986453_The_Foundations_of_Program_Verification","275166094_The_formal_strong_completeness_of_partial_monoidal_Boolean_BI","270752720_Erratum_to_A_substructural_logic_for_layered_graphs","268707761_Model-theoretical_methods_in_the_theory_of_topoi_and_related_categories_II","268247279_Topological_Kripke_models","267170210_A_discipline_of_mathematical_systems_modelling","265908768_A_mathematical_theory_of_resources","265543893_Ten_years_of_Hoare's_logic_a_survey","263161470_Generalized_Galois_Logics_Relational_Semantics_of_Nonclassical_Logical_Calculi","263161407_Algebraic_Methods_in_Philosophical_Logic","259810774_Logical_Dynamics_of_Information_and_Interaction","259162944_Relational_semantics_for_full_linear_logic","257666095_Bunched_Logics_Displayed","246998161_On_closed_categories_of_functors_II","245322766_An_embedding_theorem_for_closed_categories","243777300_From_categorial_grammar_to_bilinear_logic","243702300_On_the_Calculus_of_Syntactic_Types","243670324_First_Order_Categorical_Logic","243653045_Entailment_The_Logic_of_Relevance_and_Necessity","242688775_Modal_and_Temporal_Properties_of_Processes","242650242_The_Theory_of_Representations_for_Boolean_Algebras","239932729_Ten_years_of_Hoare's_logic_A_survey-Part_I","239407954_Tableau_Methods_for_Modal_and_Temporal_Logics","237131537_Semantical_Analysis_of_Intuitionistic_Logic_I","237123694_The_formulae-as-types_notion_of_construction","226179980_A_Calculus_and_logic_of_resources_and_processes","234784651_Design_Philosophy_of_the_DARPA_Internet_protocols","229711042_Hyperdoctrines_natural_deduction_and_the_Beck_condition","228668072_The_Semantics_of_BI_and_Resource_Tableaux","226287960_Algebra_and_logic_for_access_control"]}
