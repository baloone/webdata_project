{"id":"220805831_The_Matita_Interactive_Theorem_Prover","abstract":"Matita is an interactive theorem prover being developed by the Helm team at the University of Bologna. Its stable version\n0.5.x may be downloaded at \nhttp://matita.cs.unibo.it\n. The tool originated in the European project MoWGLI as a set of XML-based tools aimed to provide a mathematician-friendly\nweb-interface to repositories of formal mathematical knoweldge, supporting advanced content-based functionalities for querying,\nsearching and browsing the library. It has since then evolved into a fully fledged ITP, specifically designed as a light-weight,\nbut competitive system, particularly suited for the assessment of innovative ideas, both at foundational and logical level.\nIn this paper, we give an account of the whole system, its peculiarities and its main applications.","authors":["Andrea Asperti","Wilmer Ricciotti","Claudio Sacerdoti Coen","Enrico Tassi"],"meta":["July 2011","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-22438-6_7","SourceDBLP","Conference: Automated Deduction - CADE-23 - 23rd International Conference on Automated Deduction, Wroclaw, Poland, July 31 - August 5, 2011.
