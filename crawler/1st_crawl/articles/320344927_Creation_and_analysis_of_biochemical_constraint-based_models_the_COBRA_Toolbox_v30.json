The COBRA Toolbox is a comprehensive software suite of interoperable COBRA methods. It has found widespread applications in biology, biomedicine, and biotechnology because its functions can be flexibly combined to implement tailored COBRA protocols for any biochemical network. Version 3.0 includes new methods for quality controlled reconstruction, modelling, topological analysis, strain and experimental design, network visualisation as well as network integration of cheminformatic, metabolomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and thermochemical data. New multi-lingual code integration also enables an expansion in COBRA application scope via high-precision, high-performance, and nonlinear numerical optimisation solvers for multi-scale, multi-cellular and reaction kinetic modelling, respectively. This protocol can be adapted for the generation and analysis of a constraint-based model in a wide variety of molecular systems biology scenarios.","authors":["Laurent Heirendt","Sylvain Arreckx","Thomas Pfau","Sebasti√°n Nelson Mendoza"],"meta":["October 2017Nature Protocols 14(3)","DOI:10.1038/s41596-018-0098-2","Projects: Creation and analysis of biochemical constraint-based models: the COBRA Toolbox v3.0Metabolic engineering"],"references":["326239724_KBase_The_United_States_Department_of_Energy_Systems_Biology_Knowledgebase","323271637_Recon3D_enables_a_three-dimensional_view_of_gene_variation_in_human_metabolism","319508974_An_in-silico_approach_to_predict_and_exploit_synthetic_lethality_in_cancer_metabolism","318574145_MINERVA-a_platform_for_visualization_and_curation_of_molecular_interaction_networks","318026308_Comparative_evaluation_of_atom_mapping_algorithms_for_balanced_metabolic_reactions_Application_to_Recon_3D","317145023_Mammalian_Systems_Biotechnology_Reveals_Global_Cellular_Adaptations_in_a_Recombinant_CHO_Cell_Line","316091273_From_elementary_flux_modes_to_elementary_flux_vectors_Metabolic_pathway_analysis_with_arbitrary_linear_flux_constraints","315944489_Elucidating_dynamic_metabolic_physiology_through_network_integration_of_quantitative_time-course_metabolomics","349548158_Optimization_Methods_in_Metabolic_Networks_MaranasOptimization_Methods_in_Metabolic_Networks","326026940_Gaussian_Cooling_and_On3_Algorithms_for_Volume_and_Gaussian_Volume"]}
