In this context, reconfigurable manufacturing systems (RMSs) have emerged to fulfil these requirements. RMS is one of the latest manufacturing paradigms, where machines components, software or material handling units can be added, removed, modified or interchanged as needed and when imposed by the necessity to react and respond rapidly and cost-effectively to changing. This research work addresses the multi-objective single-product multi-unit process plan generation problem in a reconfigurable manufacturing environment where three hybrid heuristics are proposed and compared namely: repetitive single-unit process plan heuristic (RSUPP), iterated local search on single-unit process plans heuristic (LSSUPP) and archive-based iterated local search heuristic (ABILS). Single-unit process plans are generated using the adapted non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II). Moreover, in addition to the minimisation of the classical total production cost and the total completion time, the minimisation of the maximum machines exploitation time is considered as a novel optimisation criterion, in order to have high quality products. To illustrate the applicability of the three approaches, examples are presented and the obtained numerical results are analysed.","authors":["Fay√ßal Touzout","Lyes Benyoucef"],"meta":["July 2019International Journal of Production Research 57(24):7520-7535","DOI:10.1080/00207543.2019.1635277"],"references":["327538752_Delayed_reconfigurable_manufacturing_system","319171115_Modularity_assessment_in_reconfigurable_manufacturing_system_RMS_design_an_Archived_Multi-Objective_Simulated_Annealing-based_approach","309628833_Integrated_process_planning_and_system_configuration_for_mixed-model_machining_on_rotary_transfer_machine","306345567_Decision_support_for_design_of_reconfigurable_rotary_machining_systems_for_family_part_production","290381272_Bi-objective_optimization_of_integrating_configuration_generation_and_scheduling_for_reconfigurable_flow_lines_using_NSGA-II","280939887_Reconfigurable_Manufacturing_Systems","270280033_Encyclopedia_of_Production_and_Manufacturing_Management","265871265_Chapter_3_General_RMS_Characteristics_Comparison_with_Dedicated_and_Flexible_Systems","262647145_A_new_heuristic_for_integrated_process_planning_and_scheduling_in_reconfigurable_manufacturing_systems","261750241_A_review_on_artificial_intelligence_applications_to_the_optimal_design_of_dedicated_and_reconfigurable_manufacturing_systems","258341873_Optimization_of_Operation_Sequencing_in_CAPP_Using_Superhybrid_Genetic_Algorithms-Simulated_Annealing_Technique","234125620_Reconfigurable_manufacturing_systems_CIRP_Ann_Manuf_Technol","226292761_Production_planning_and_performance_optimization_of_reconfigurable_manufacturing_systems_using_genetic_algorithm","225974386_An_adapted_NSGA-2_algorithm_based_dynamic_process_plan_generation_for_a_reconfigurable_manufacturing_system","220572690_Production_planning_of_reconfigurable_manufacturing_systems_with_stochastic_demands_using_Tabu_search","44093584_Reconfigurable_manufacturing_systems_The_state_of_the_art","328988689_Sustainable_multi-unit_process_plan_generation_in_a_reconfigurable_manufacturing_environment_A_comparative_study_of_three_hybrid-meta-heuristics","327931443_Reconfigurable_manufacturing_systems_Literature_review_and_research_trend","327781369_Multi-objective_sustainable_process_plan_generation_in_a_reconfigurable_manufacturing_environment_exact_and_adapted_evolutionary_approaches","326723303_Understanding_reconfigurability_of_manufacturing_systems_An_empirical_analysis","321791053_Configuration_design_in_scalable_reconfigurable_manufacturing_systems_RMS_a_case_of_single-product_flow_line_SPFL","321621304_Changeable_and_Reconfigurable_Manufacturing_Systems","321290381_An_approach_to_identify_the_optimal_configurations_and_reconfiguration_processes_for_design_of_reconfigurable_machine_tools","320953766_Reconfigurable_machining_process_planning_for_part_variety_in_new_manufacturing_paradigms_Definitions_models_and_framework","317443906_Reconfigurability_consideration_and_scheduling_of_products_in_a_manufacturing_industry","304155157_Outsourcing_of_product_design_and_development","287611575_The_Global_Manufacturing_Revolution_Product-Process-Business_Integration_and_Reconfigurable_Systems","280010929_Reconfigurable_Manufacturing_on_Multiple_Levels_Literature_Review_and_Research_Directions","276173067_Optimisation_of_process_plans_in_reconfigurable_manufacturing_systems_using_ant_colony_technique","263167797_Computer_Aided_Process_Planning_in_Agile_Manufacturing_Environment","257336713_Reconfigurations_of_manufacturing_systems_-_An_empirical_study_on_concepts_research_and_applications","257242283_Simulated_annealing_with_auxiliary_knowledge_for_process_planning_optimization_in_reconfigurable_manufacturing","231538033_A_non_dominated_sorting_genetic_algorithm_based_approach_for_optimal_machines_selection_in_reconfigurable_manufacturing_environment","227108273_Reconfigurable_Process_Plans_For_Responsive_Manufacturing_Systems","222611508_Production_planning_in_reconfigurable_enterprises_and_reconfigurable_production_systems","222538309_Mathematical_Modeling_for_Reconfigurable_Process_Planning","221704669_A_Method_for_Solving_Traveling-Salesman_Problems","220381736_Generation_of_machine_configurations_based_on_product_features","220291888_Enhanced_simulated-annealing-based_algorithms_and_their_applications_to_process_planning_in_reconfigurable_manufacturing_systems","3418687_A_fast_and_elitist_multiobjective_genetic_algorithm_NSGA-II"]}
