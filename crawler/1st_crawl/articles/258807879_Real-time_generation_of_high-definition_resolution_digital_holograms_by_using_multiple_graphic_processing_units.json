{"id":"258807879_Real-time_generation_of_high-definition_resolution_digital_holograms_by_using_multiple_graphic_processing_units","abstract":"We describe and evaluate a practical approach for implementing\ncomputer-generated-holography (CGH) using multiple graphic processing\nunits (GPUs). The proposed method can generate high-definition (HD)\nresolution (1920Ã—1080) digital holograms in real-time. In order to\ndemonstrate the plausibility of our method, some experimental results\nwill be given. First, we discuss the advantage of GPUs for CGH against\ncentral processing units (CPUs) by comparing the performance of both.\nOur results show that use of GPUs can shorten CGH computation time by\n2791 times. Then, we discuss the potential of multiple GPUs for\ngenerating HD resolution digital holograms in real-time by measuring and\nanalyzing the CGH computational time in accordance with the number of\nGPUs. Our result shows that the CGH computational time decreases\nnonlinearly, with a logarithmic-like curve, as the number of GPU\nincreases. Therefore, we can determine the number of GPUs to maximize\nthe efficiency. Consequently, our implementation can generate HD\nresolution digital holograms at a rate of more than 66 hps\n(holograms-per-second) using two NVIDIA GTX 590 cards.","authors":["Joongseok Song","Jungsik Park","Hanhoon Park","Jong-Il Park"],"meta":["January 2013Optical Engineering 52(1):5803-","DOI:10.1117/1.OE.52.1.015803"],"references":["43050853_Fast_CGH_computation_using_S-LUT_on_GPU","2766592_Interactive_Computation_of_Holograms_Using_a_Look-Up_Table","243484009_Lossy_coding_technique_for_digital_holographic_signal","226201786_Fast_Computation_of_Fresnel_Holograms_Employing_Difference","222746241_An_efficient_computational_method_suitable_for_hardware_of_computer-generated_hologram_with_phase_computation_by_addition","44852813_Fast_calculation_of_computer-generated-hologram_on_AMD_HD5000_series_GPU_and_OpenCL","40847866_Complex_Spatial_Filtering_with_Binary_Masks","40443365_Graphics_processing_unit_accelerated_computation_of_digital_holograms","5257950_Effective_generation_of_digital_holograms_of_three-dimensional_objects_using_a_novel_look-up_table_method"]}
