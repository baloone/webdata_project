{"id":"331639316_Global_Evolution_of_Research_in_Artificial_Intelligence_in_Health_and_Medicine_A_Bibliometric_Study","abstract":"The increasing application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in health and medicine has attracted a great deal of research interest in recent decades. This study aims to provide a global and historical picture of research concerning AI in health and medicine. A total of 27,451 papers that were published between 1977 and 2018 (84.59% were dated 2008-2018) retrieving from the Web of Science platform was used to perform. The descriptive analysis and network visualization maps examined the publication volume, authors and countries collaboration. A global mapping of authorsâ€™ keywords and content analysis of related scientific literature highlighted major techniques, including Robotic, Machine learning, Artificial neural network, Artificial intelligence, Natural language process, and their most frequently applications in Clinical Prediction. The highest number of publication was related to Cancer, followed by Heart Diseases and Stroke, Vision impairment, Alzheimer and Depression. Moreover, the shortage in the research of AI application to some high burden diseases suggest future directions in AI research. This study offers a first and comprehensive picture of the global efforts directed towards this increasingly important and prolific field of research and informs the development of global and national protocols and regulations on the justification and adaptation of medical AI products.","authors":["Bach Tran","Giang Hai Ha","Giang Thu Vu","Quan-Hoang Vuong"],"meta":["March 2019Journal of Clinical Medicine 8(3)","DOI:10.3390/jcm8030360","Project: Artificial Intelligence in Medicine (AIM)"],"references":["328916192_Global_regional_and_national_disability-adjusted_life-years_DALYs_for_359_diseases_and_injuries_and_healthy_life_expectancy_HALE_for_195_countries_and_territories_1990-2017_a_systematic_analysis_for_t","328829124_Global_regional_and_national_disability-adjusted_life-years_DALYs_for_359_diseases_and_injuries_and_healthy_life_expectancy_HALE_for_195_countries_and_territories_1990-2017_a_systematic_analysis_for_t","328430572_The_Artificial_Intelligence_Clinician_learns_optimal_treatment_strategies_for_sepsis_in_intensive_care","327873946_An_open_database_of_productivity_in_Vietnam's_social_sciences_and_humanities_for_public_use","327704594_Health_intelligence_How_Artificial_Intelligence_Transforms_Population_and_Personalized_Health","327047340_Artificial_intelligence_as_a_medical_device_in_radiology_ethical_and_regulatory_issues_in_Europe_and_the_United_States","330028726_DOPING_Generative_Data_Augmentation_for_Unsupervised_Anomaly_Detection_with_GAN","328200067_Artificial_intelligence_in_healthcare","326747105_Augmentation_of_Physician_Assessments_with_Multi-Omics_Enhances_Predictability_of_Drug_Response_A_Case_Study_of_Major_Depressive_Disorder","325431657_How_artificial_intelligence_is_changing_drug_discovery"]}
