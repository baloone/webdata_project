{"id":"259824921_A_Microkernel_Architecture_for_Constraint_Programming","abstract":"This paper presents a microkernel architecture for constraint programming organized around a small number of core functionalities and minimal interfaces. The architecture contrasts with the monolithic nature of many implementations. With this design, variables, domains and constraints all remain external to the microkernel which isolates the propagation logic and event protocols from the modeling constructions. The Objective-CP search blends the control primitives of the host language with search combinators in a completely transparent and fully compositional way, delivering a natural search procedure in which one can use native constructions and tools such as debuggers. Empirical results indicate that the software engineering benefits are not incompatible with runtime efficiency.","authors":["Laurent Michel","Pascal Van Hentenryck"],"meta":["April 2017Constraints 22(2)","DOI:10.1007/s10601-016-9242-1","SourcearXiv","Project: CP Solver"],"references":["259824741_Domain_Views_for_Constraint_Programming","257361289_The_Objective-CP_Optimization_System","257360368_Model_Combinators_for_Hybrid_Optimization","332109229_Constraint-based_local_search","332090593_Numerica_A_Modeling_Language_for_Global_Optimization","313559998_The_constraint_logic_programming_language_CHIP","275902276_The_OPL_Optimization_Programming_Language","260750305_Logic-Based_Methods_for_Optimization_Combining_Optimization_and_Constraint_Satisfaction","244431109_Integration_of_Mathematical_Programming_and_Constraint_Programming_for_Combinatorial_Optimization_Problems","242517085_Overview_of_the_chip_compiler"]}
