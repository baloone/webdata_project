{"id":"335021847_PYRO_-_NN_Python_Reconstruction_Operators_in_Neural_Networks","abstract":"Purpose: \nRecently, several attempts were conducted to transfer deep learning to medical image reconstruction. An increasingly number of publications follow the concept of embedding the computed tomography (CT) reconstruction as a known operator into a neural network. However, most of the approaches presented lack an efficient CT reconstruction framework fully integrated into deep learning environments. As a result, many approaches use workarounds for mathematically unambiguously solvable problems.\n\nMethods: \nPYRO-NN is a generalized framework to embed known operators into the prevalent deep learning framework Tensorflow. The current status includes state-of-the-art parallel-, fan-, and cone-beam projectors, and back-projectors accelerated with CUDA provided as Tensorflow layers. On top, the framework provides a high-level Python API to conduct FBP and iterative reconstruction experiments with data from real CT systems.\n\nResults: \nThe framework provides all necessary algorithms and tools to design end-to-end neural network pipelines with integrated CT reconstruction algorithms. The high-level Python API allows a simple use of the layers as known from Tensorflow. All algorithms and tools are referenced to a scientific publication and are compared to existing non-deep learning reconstruction frameworks. To demonstrate the capabilities of the layers, the framework comes with baseline experiments, which are described in the supplementary material. The framework is available as open-source software under the Apache 2.0 licence at https://github.com/csyben/PYRO-NN.\n\nConclusions: \nPYRO-NN comes with the prevalent deep learning framework Tensorflow and allows to setup end-to-end trainable neural networks in the medical image reconstruction context. We believe that the framework will be a step toward reproducible research and give the medical physics community a toolkit to elevate medical image reconstruction with new deep learning techniques.","authors":["Christopher Syben","Markus Michen","Bernhard Stimpel","Stephan Seitz"],"meta":["August 2019Medical Physics 46(11)","DOI:10.1002/mp.13753"],"references":["330665962_A_gentle_introduction_to_deep_learning_in_medical_image_processing","320043979_ODL_Operator_Discretization_Library","318814054_Learned_Experts'_Assessment-based_Reconstruction_Network_LEARN_for_Sparse-data_CT","318584078_Learned_Primal-Dual_Reconstruction","316598940_Image_reconstruction_by_domain_transform_manifold_learning","329317632_Precision_Learning_Towards_Use_of_Known_Operators_in_Neural_Networks","325159150_Image_Reconstruction_Is_a_New_Frontier_of_Machine_Learning","324997751_Deep_Learning_Computed_Tomography_Learning_Projection-Domain_Weights_From_Image_Domain_in_Limited_Angle_Problems","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","318120453_Deep_Convolutional_Framelets_A_General_Deep_Learning_for_Inverse_Problems"]}
