{"id":"333040203_Multicast_routing_from_a_set_of_data_centers_in_elastic_optical_networks","abstract":"This paper introduces the Multi-Server Multicast (MSM) approach for Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) delivering services offered by a set of Data Centers (DCs). All DCs offer the same services. The network is an Elastic Optical Network (EON) and for a good performance, routing is performed directly at the optical layer. Optical switches have heterogeneous capacities, that is, light splitting is not available in all switches. Moreover, frequency slot conversion is not possible in any of them. We account for the degradation that optical signals suffer both in the splitting nodes, as well as across fiber links to compute their transmission reach. The optimal solution of the MSM is a set of light-hierarchies. This multicast route contains a light trail from one of the DCs to each of the destinations with respect to the optical constraints while optimizing an objective (e.g., minimizing a function). Finding such a structure is often an NP-hard problem. The light-hierarchies initiated from different DCs permit delivering the multicast session to all end-users with a better utilization of the optical resources, while also reducing multicast session latencies, as contents can be delivered from such DCs closer to end-users. We propose an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation to optimally decide on which light-hierarchies should be setup. Simulation results illustrate the benefits of MSM in two reference backbone networks.","authors":["Miklos Molnar","Le Dinh Danh","Jordi Perelló","Josep Solé-Pareta"],"meta":["May 2019Optical Switching and Networking 34(9)","DOI:10.1016/j.osn.2019.04.002"],"references":["312112229_Software_defined_networking_for_optical_networks","284696928_Software-Defined_Networking_Using_OpenFlow_Protocols_Applications_and_Architectural_Design_Choices","276206944_Joint_Optimization_of_Multicast_and_Unicast_Flows_in_Elastic_Optical_Networks","270158871_Minimizing_Blocking_Probability_for_the_Multicast_Routing_and_Wavelength_Assignment_Problem_in_WDM_Networks_Exact_Solutions_and_Heuristic_Algorithms","269398546_Optimization_of_Multicast_Traffic_in_Elastic_Optical_Networks_With_Distance-Adaptive_Transmission","268008030_Hierarchies_to_Solve_Constrained_Connected_Spanning_Problems","267268153_Distance-Adaptive_Transmission_in_Cloud-Ready_Elastic_Optical_Networks","264580090_On_the_Characterization_of_the_Structural_Robustness_of_Data_Center_Networks","260686521_Optical_Networks_for_Grid_and_Cloud_Computing_Applications","259932311_Green_Data_Center_Networks_Challenges_and_Opportunities","220015793_Elastic_Bandwidth_Allocation_in_Flexible_OFDM-Based_Optical_Networks","47860616_Light-Hierarchy_The_Optimal_Structure_for_Multicast_Routing_in_WDM_Mesh_Networks","47842515_Traveling_salesman_path_problems","321543487_Elastic_Optical_Networks_Architectures_Technologies_and_Control","320319420_Cost-effective_Spatial_Super-channel_Allocation_in_Flex-GridMCF_Optical_Core_Networks","317143002_Manycast_routing_modulation_level_and_spectrum_assignment_over_elastic_optical_networks","316807220_Optical_Networks","308902033_Impairment-and_Splitting-Aware_Cloud-Ready_Multicast_Provisioning_in_Elastic_Optical_Networks","305459293_Multicast_Routing_and_Distance-Adaptive_Spectrum_Allocation_in_Elastic_Optical_Networks_With_Shared_Protection","282999152_A_survey_on_data_center_networking_for_cloud_computing","282477076_Energy-Efficient_Manycast_Routing_and_Spectrum_Assignment_in_Elastic_Optical_Networks_for_Cloud_Computing_Environment","281058815_Streaming_Multicast_Video_over_Software-Defined_Networks","273398910_Software-Defined_Networking_A_survey","271437287_Design_integrated_RSA_for_multicast_in_elastic_optical_networks_with_a_layered_approach","263767935_The_GN-Model_of_Fiber_Non-Linear_Propagation_and_its_Applications","262879413_Spectrum-Efficient_Anycast_in_Elastic_Optical_Inter-Datacenter_Networks","260357456_Efficient_Resource_Allocation_for_All-Optical_Multicasting_Over_Spectrum-Sliced_Elastic_Optical_Networks","258797392_Dynamic_Service_Provisioning_in_Elastic_Optical_Networks_With_Hybrid_Single-Multi-Path_Routing"]}
