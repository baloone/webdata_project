{"id":"330526127_One_Note_About_the_Tu-Deng_Conjecture_in_Case_wt_5","abstract":"Let k ≥ 2 be an integer, define St := {(a,b) ∈ Z2|0 ≤ a,b ≤ 2k – 2,a + b = t(mod 2k – 1),w(a)+w(b) ≤ k – 1}, where t ∈ Z; 1 ≤ t ≤ 2k – 2. This paper gives the upper bound of cardinality of St in the case of w(t) = 5. With this one, we conclude that a conjecture proposed by Tu and Deng in 2011 is right when w(t) = 5.","authors":["Yindong Chen","Fei Guo","Zhangquan Gong","Weihong Cai"],"meta":["January 2019IEEE Access PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2894074"],"references":["225634095_Basic_Theory_in_Construction_of_Boolean_Functions_with_Maximum_Possible_Annihilator_Immunity","225597786_Further_properties_of_several_classes_of_Boolean_functions_with_optimum_algebraic_immunity","220681152_Constructing_Symmetric_Boolean_Functions_With_Maximum_Algebraic_Immunity","220334944_On_a_generalized_combinatorial_conjecture_involving_addition_mod_2","220334176_On_a_Combinatorial_Conjecture","220334098_A_Conjecture_on_Binary_String_and_Its_Applications_on_Constructing_Boolean_Functions_of_Optimal_Algebraic_Immunity","3085927_Algebraic_immunity_for_cryptographically_significant_Boolean_functions_Analysis_and_construction","306116166_New_results_about_Tu-Deng's_conjecture","275718409_A_note_on_the_Tu-Deng_conjecture","220681072_Two_Classes_of_Symmetric_Boolean_Functions_With_Optimum_Algebraic_Immunity_Construction_and_Analysis"]}
