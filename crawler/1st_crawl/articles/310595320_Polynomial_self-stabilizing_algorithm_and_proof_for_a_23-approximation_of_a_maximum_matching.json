{"id":"310595320_Polynomial_self-stabilizing_algorithm_and_proof_for_a_23-approximation_of_a_maximum_matching","abstract":"We present the first polynomial self-stabilizing algorithm for finding a $\\frac23$-approximation of a maximum matching in a general graph. The previous best known algorithm has been presented by Manne \\emph{et al.} \\cite{ManneMPT11} and has a sub-exponential time complexity under the distributed adversarial daemon \\cite{Coor}. Our new algorithm is an adaptation of the Manne \\emph{et al.} algorithm and works under the same daemon, but with a time complexity in $O(n^3)$ moves. Moreover, our algorithm only needs one more boolean variable than the previous one, thus as in the Manne \\emph{et al.} algorithm, it only requires a constant amount of memory space (three identifiers and $two$ booleans per node).","authors":["Johanne Cohen","Khaled Ma√¢mra","George Manoussakis","Laurence Pilard"],"meta":["November 2016","Project: Self-stabilizing matching"],"references":["301817678_The_Mann_et_al_self-stabilizing_23-approximation_matching_algorithm_is_sub-exponential","224928640_A_New_Self-Stabilizing_Maximal_Matching_Algorithm","222581373_A_simple_approximation_algorithm_for_the_weighted_matching_problem","221540399_A_Self-stabilizing_23-Approximation_Algorithm_for_the_Maximum_Matching_Problem","269858936_Introduction_Self_Stabilization","242600743_An_n2_algorithm_for_maximum_matching_in_bipartite_graphs","221499497_An_N52_Algorithm_for_Maximum_Matching_in_Bipartite_Graphs","220150762_A_Self-stabilizing_23-Approximation_Algorithm_for_the_Maximum_Matching_Problem","2702275_Linear_Time_12-Approximation_Algorithm_for_Maximum_Weighted_Matching_in_General_Graphs"]}
