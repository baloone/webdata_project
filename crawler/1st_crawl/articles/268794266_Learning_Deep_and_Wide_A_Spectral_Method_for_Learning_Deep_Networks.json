{"id":"268794266_Learning_Deep_and_Wide_A_Spectral_Method_for_Learning_Deep_Networks","abstract":"Building intelligent systems that are capable of extracting high-level representations from high-dimensional sensory data lies at the core of solving many computer vision-related tasks. We propose the multispectral neural networks (MSNN) to learn features from multicolumn deep neural networks and embed the penultimate hierarchical discriminative manifolds into a compact representation. The low-dimensional embedding explores the complementary property of different views wherein the distribution of each view is sufficiently smooth and hence achieves robustness, given few labeled training data. Our experiments show that spectrally embedding several deep neural networks can explore the optimum output from the multicolumn networks and consistently decrease the error rate compared with a single deep network.","authors":["Ling Shao","Di Wu","Xuelong Li"],"meta":["December 2014IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems 25(12):2303-8","DOI:10.1109/TNNLS.2014.2308519","SourcePubMed"],"references":["260353792_Multiview_Vector-Valued_Manifold_Regularization_for_Multilabel_Image_Classification","240308775_Representation_Learning_A_Review_and_New_Perspectives","231438816_A_Set_of_Geometrical_Features_for_Writer_Identification","228339739_Viualizing_data_using_t-SNE","228102719_Improving_neural_networks_by_preventing_co-adaptation_of_feature_detectors","224216007_Acoustic_Modeling_Using_Deep_Belief_Networks","221344904_Convolutional_deep_belief_networks_for_scalable_unsupervised_learning_of_hierarchical_representations","221078713_Stacked_Convolutional_Auto-Encoders_for_Hierarchical_Feature_Extraction","220812758_Flexible_High_Performance_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_Image_Classification","220424626_Unsupervised_Learning_of_Hierarchical_Representations_with_Convolutional_Deep_Belief_Networks","216792694_Convolutional_Learning_of_Spatio-temporal_Features","2985446_Gradient-Based_Learning_Applied_to_Document_Recognition","309186321_A_practical_guide_to_training_restricted_boltzmann_machinesJ","306218037_Learning_multiple_layers_of_features_from_tiny_images","277634634_Learning_Deep_Generative_Models","272746011_A_Practical_Guide_to_Training_Restricted_Boltzmann_Machines_Version_1","268409064_Multiresolution_Deep_Belief_Networks","267960550_ImageNet_Classification_with_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","267687028_Multiple_queries_for_large_scale_specific_object_retrieval","267554204_Multimodal_Learning_with_Deep_Boltzmann_Machines","265748773_Learning_Multiple_Layers_of_Features_from_Tiny_Images","261317403_Robust_Boltzmann_Machines_for_recognition_and_denoising","260710146_Silhouette_Analysis-Based_Action_Recognition_Via_Exploiting_Human_Poses","234801250_A_Tutorial_on_Spectral_Clustering","230866907_Spatio-Temporal_Convolutional_Sparse_Auto-Encoder_for_Sequence_Classification","224217676_m-SNE_Multiview_Stochastic_Neighbor_Embedding","224116027_Multiview_Spectral_Embedding","221885177_Multi-Column_Deep_Neural_Network_for_Traffic_Sign_Classification","221663833_Multi-column_Deep_Neural_Networks_for_Image_Classification","221345988_Using_fast_weights_to_improve_persistent_contrastive_divergence","220320682_On_the_Convergence_Properties_of_Contrastive_Divergence","11207765_ARTICLE_Training_Products_of_Experts_by_Minimizing_Contrastive_Divergence","7647316_Framewise_phoneme_classification_with_bidirectional_LSTM_and_other_neural_network_architectures","2477494_Normalized_Cuts_and_Image_Segmentation"]}
