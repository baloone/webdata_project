{"id":"225617808_Resources_for_Turkish_morphological_processing","abstract":"We present a set of language resources and tools—a morphological parser, a morphological disambiguator, and a text corpus—for\nexploiting Turkish morphology in natural language processing applications. The morphological parser is a state-of-the-art\nfinite-state transducer-based implementation of Turkish morphology. The disambiguator is based on the averaged perceptron\nalgorithm and has the best accuracy reported for Turkish in the literature. The text corpus has been compiled from the web\nand contains about 500 million tokens. This is the largest Turkish web corpus published.\n\nKeywordsTurkish language resources–Morphological parser–Morphological disambiguation–Web corpus","authors":["Haşim Sak","Tunga Gungor","Murat Saraclar"],"meta":["May 2011Language Resources and Evaluation 45(2):249-261","DOI:10.1007/s10579-010-9128-6","SourceDBLP"],"references":["292705403_Development_of_a_corpus_and_a_treebank_for_present-day_written_Turkish","275999323_Morphology_by_Itself_Stems_and_Inflectional_Classes","267448270_Introduction_to_the_Special_Issue_on_the_Web_as_Corpus","242508674_Two-level_rule_compiler","239591865_A_compiler_for_two-level_phonological_rules_in_tools_for_morphological_analysis","344900019_Turkish_A_Comprehensive_Grammar","313620779_Distributed_morphology_and_the_pieces_of_inflection","273546921_Introduction_to_the_special_issue","272775595_A-Morphous_Morphology","239063344_Morphology_by_Itself_Stems_and_Inflectional_Classes"]}
