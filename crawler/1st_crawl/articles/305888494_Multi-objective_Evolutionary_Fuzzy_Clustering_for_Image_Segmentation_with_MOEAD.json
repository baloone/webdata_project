{"id":"305888494_Multi-objective_Evolutionary_Fuzzy_Clustering_for_Image_Segmentation_with_MOEAD","abstract":"In order to achieve robust performance of preserving significant image details while removing noise for image segmentation, this paper presents a multi-objective evolutionary fuzzy clustering (MOEFC) algorithm to convert fuzzy clustering problems for image segmentation into multi-objective problems. The multi-objective problems are optimized by multi-objective evolutionary algorithm with decomposition. The decomposition strategy is adopted to project the multi-objective problem into a number of sub-problems. Each sub-problem represents a fuzzy clustering problem incorporating local information for image segmentation. Opposition-based learning is utilized to improve search capability of the proposed algorithm. Two problem-specific techniques, an adaptive weighted fuzzy factor and a mixed population initialization, are introduced to improve the performance of the algorithm. Experiment results on synthetic and real images illustrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve a trade-off between preserving image details and removing noise for image segmentation.","authors":["Mengxuan Zhang","Licheng Jiao","Wenping Ma","Jingjing Ma"],"meta":["August 2016Applied Soft Computing
