{"id":"5142924_Support_Vector_Machines_in_R","abstract":"Being among the most popular and efficient classification and regression methods currently available, implementations of support vector machines exist in almost every popular programming language. Currently four R packages contain SVM related software. The purpose of this paper is to present and compare these implementations.","authors":["Kurt Hornik","David Meyer","Alexandros Karatzoglou"],"meta":["April 2006Journal of Statistical Software 15(i09)","DOI:10.18637/jss.v015.i09","SourceRePEc"],"references":["256309499_Fuzzy_Support_Vector_Machines","243776958_Single-layer_learning_revisited_A_stepwise_procedure_for_building_and_training_a_neural_network","313557859_Pairwise_classification_and_support_vector_machines_In_Advances_in_kernel_methods_Support_vector_learning_Cambridge_MA","268289872_kernlab_-_A_Kernel_Methods_Package","248192679_UCI_Repository_of_Machine_Learning_Databases","247305114_Quadprog_Functions_to_Solve_Quadratic_Programming_Problems","247258727_Probabilistic_Predictions_for_Support_Vector_Regression","246840437_Mlbench_A_Collection_for_Artificial_and_Real-world_Machine_Learning_Benchmarking_Problems","246610739_KlaR-Classification_and_Visualization","240137819_Newton''s_Method_for_Large-scale_Bound_Constrained_Problems"]}
