Particular attention is paid to the functioning of such neologisms in common usage (linguistic usus). Ukrainian electronic resources are used as a research material and verification tool. Morphemic, word-formative and comparative analysis of derivatives and the method of periphrasis allowed us to determine the reasons for the production of appropriate and inappropriate special names that can compete with English borrowings in this field.","authors":["Лариса Кислюк"],"meta":["November 2020","DOI:10.31261/FL.2020.07.03"],"references":[]}
