{"id":"343113383_Neuro-inspired_computing_chips","abstract":"The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) demands the rapid development of domain-specific hardware specifically designed for AI applications. Neuro-inspired computing chips integrate a range of features inspired by neurobiological systems and could provide an energy-efficient approach to AI computing workloads. Here, we review the development of neuro-inspired computing chips, including artificial neural network chips and spiking neural network chips. We propose four key metrics for benchmarking neuro-inspired computing chips — computing density, energy efficiency, computing accuracy, and on-chip learning capability — and discuss co-design principles, from the device to the algorithm level, for neuro-inspired computing chips based on non-volatile memory. We also provide a future electronic design automation tool chain and propose a roadmap for the development of large-scale neuro-inspired computing chips.","authors":["Wenqiang Zhang","Bin Gao","Jianshi Tang","Peng Yao"],"meta":["July 2020Nature Electronics 3(7):371-382","DOI:10.1038/s41928-020-0435-7"],"references":["340611455_Three-dimensional_memristor_circuits_as_complex_neural_networks","338905647_Fully_hardware-implemented_memristor_convolutional_neural_network","337120796_Versatile_stochastic_dot_product_circuits_based_on_nonvolatile_memories_for_high_performance_neurocomputing_and_neurooptimization","336744162_Quantum_supremacy_using_a_programmable_superconducting_processor","334945625_FPSA_A_Full_System_Stack_Solution_for_Reconfigurable_ReRAM-based_NN_Accelerator_Architecture","334816151_Towards_artificial_general_intelligence_with_hybrid_Tianjic_chip_architecture","340624693_332_A_Fully_Integrated_Analog_ReRAM_Based_784TOPSW_Compute-In-Memory_Chip_with_Fully_Parallel_MAC_Computing","340288631_Memory_devices_and_applications_for_in-memory_computing","337573486_Towards_spike-based_machine_intelligence_with_neuromorphic_computing","336362099_Conv-RAM_An_Energy-efficient_SRAM_with_Embedded_Convolution_Computation_for_Low-power_CNN_based_Machine_Learning_Applications"]}
