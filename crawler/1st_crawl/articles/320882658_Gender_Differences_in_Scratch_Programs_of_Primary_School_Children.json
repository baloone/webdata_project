{"id":"320882658_Gender_Differences_in_Scratch_Programs_of_Primary_School_Children","abstract":"It is commonly believed that the attitudes towards programming are strongly dependent on gender among adolescents or adults. Regarding younger children, these differences in the attitudes might be less relevant. To investigate this, we have analyzed the learning outcomes of an introductory programming course for primary school children. The three-day course was designed specifically for 4th-grade students (ages 9-10) and taught four times up to now Fifty-eight children (26 girls and 32 boys) have participated from May to August 2016. During these courses, the children have developed 127 Scratch projects. We found that boys and girls had used different block types to develop their programs. It also showed that girls and boys created very different types of programs. This paper presents the course design; the methodology of the qualitative analysis and the results in detail.","authors":["Alexandra Simon","Katharina Geldreich"],"meta":["November 2017","DOI:10.1145/3137065.3137067","Conference: the 12th Workshop","Project: Computer Science in Primary Schools"],"references":["317090391_Analysis_of_Scratch_Projects_of_an_Introductory_Programming_Course_for_Primary_School_Students","310570068_A_Programming_Circus_for_Primary_Schools","310503608_Different_Perceptions_of_Computer_Science","311489317_How_Early_Does_the_CS_Gender_Gap_Emerge_A_Study_of_Collaborative_Problem_Solving_in_5th_Grade_Computer_Science","311473376_Unlocking_the_clubhouse_women_in_computing","301463451_A_Pilot_Computer_Science_and_Programming_Course_for_Primary_School_Students","289103667_Evaluation_of_computer_games_developed_by_primary_school_children_to_gauge_understanding_of_programming_concepts","286246033_Early_computing_education_-_why_What_When_How","286245879_Computer_science_for_the_elementary_classroom","285985136_The_Data_on_Diversity"]}
