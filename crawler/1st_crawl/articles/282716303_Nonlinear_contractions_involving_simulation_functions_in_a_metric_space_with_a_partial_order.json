{"id":"282716303_Nonlinear_contractions_involving_simulation_functions_in_a_metric_space_with_a_partial_order","abstract":"Very recently, Khojasteh, Shukla and Radenović [F. Khojasteh, S. Shukla, S. Radenović, Filomat, 29 (2015), 1189-1194] introduced the notion of Ƶ-contraction, that is, a nonlinear contraction involving a new class of mappings namely simulation functions. This kind of contractions generalizes the Banach contraction and unifies several known types of nonlinear contractions. In this paper, we consider a pair of nonlinear operators satisfying a nonlinear contraction involving a simulation function in a metric space endowed with a partial order. For this pair of operators, we establish coincidence and common fixed point results. As applications, several related results in fixed point theory in a metric space with a partial order are deduced.","authors":["Hajer Argoubi","Bessem Samet","Calogero Vetro"],"meta":["August 2015Journal of Nonlinear Science and Applications 8(6):1082-1094","DOI:10.22436/jnsa.008.06.18"],"references":["279889462_A_fixed_point_theorem_in_partially_ordered_sets_and_some_application_to_matrix_equations","277008846_A_New_Approach_to_the_Study_of_Fixed_Point_Theory_for_Simulation_Functions","267145115_Generalized_contractions_in_partially_ordered_Metric_spaces","243066471_Fixed_point_theorems_in_ordered_L-spaces","222877864_Generalized_weak_contractions_in_partially_ordered_Metric_spaces","220533865_Contractive_Mapping_Theorems_in_Partially_Ordered_Sets_and_Applications_to_Ordinary_Differential_Equations","46260827_Monotone_Generalized_Nonlinear_Contractions_in_Partially_Ordered_Metric_Spaces","266082042_Coincidence_point_theorems_on_metric_spaces_via_simulation_functions","257313236_Coupled_coincidence_point_theorems_for_mixed_monotone_nonlinear_operators","257179930_Fixed_point_theorems_for_-contractive_type_mappings","243066731_The_contraction_principle_for_mappings_on_a_metric_with_a_graph","222930223_Coupled_fixed_point_theorems_for_nonlinear_contractions_in_partially_ordered_Metric_spaces","222770627_Fixed_point_theorems_for_weakly_contractive_mappings_in_partly_ordered_sets"]}
