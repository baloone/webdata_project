{"id":"316615487_eSports_as_An_Emerging_Research_Context_at_CHI_Diverse_Perspectives_on_Definitions","abstract":"This paper represents our first endeavor to explore how to better understand the complex nature, scope, and practices of eSports. Our goal is to explore diverse perspectives on what defines eSports as a starting point for further research. Specifically, we critically reviewed existing definitions/understandings of eSports in different disciplines. We then interviewed 26 eSports players and qualitatively analyzed their own perceptions of eSports. We contribute to further exploring definitions and theories of eSports for CHI researchers who have considered online gaming a serious and important area of research, and highlight opportunities for new avenues of inquiry for researchers who are interested in designing technologies for this unique genre.","authors":["Guo Zhang Freeman","Donghee Yvette Wohn"],"meta":["May 2017","DOI:10.1145/3027063.3053158","Conference: the 2017 CHI Conference Extended Abstracts"],"references":["308049954_Intimate_Experiences_in_Virtual_Worlds_The_Interplay_among_Hyperpersonal_Communication_Avatar-Based_Systems_and_Experiential_Drives","306286205_What_is_eSports_and_why_do_people_watch_it","303910416_From_Faux-Social_to_Pro-Social_The_Mediating_Role_of_Copresence_in_Developing_Expectations_of_Social_Support_in_a_Game","301935818_Revisiting_Computer-Mediated_Intimacy_In-Game_Marriage_and_Dyadic_Gameplay_in_Audition","273060904_Simulating_Marriage_Gender_Roles_and_Emerging_Intimacy_in_an_Online_Game","302074036_SIGCHI_Games_The_Scope_of_Games_and_Play_Research_at_CHI","301935712_Ping_to_Win_Non-Verbal_Communication_and_Team_Performance_in_Competitive_Online_Multiplayer_Games","300918083_Simulating_Marriage","280824477_Professionalized_consumption_and_identity_transformations_in_the_field_of_eSports","273946888_Raising_the_Stakes_E-Sports_and_the_Professionalization_of_Computer_Gaming"]}
