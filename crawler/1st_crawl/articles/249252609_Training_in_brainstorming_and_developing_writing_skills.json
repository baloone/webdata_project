{"id":"249252609_Training_in_brainstorming_and_developing_writing_skills","abstract":"This article describes an exploratory study that investigated the effects of training in brainstorming strategy on learners' performance and perceptions about writing. The learners who received instruction in brainstorming were two complete classes of sophomores in a Chinese university. Writing performance, at the beginning and end of the study, was assessed and compared with a third group that did not learn brainstorming strategy but completed the same pre- and post-study task. The article describes the instruction that was provided and the findings of the effects of brainstorming instruction. The data demonstrated that explicit instruction of brainstorming strategy had a measurable influence on writing performance. The attitudinal survey also indicated that the students felt positive about the brainstorming strategy. It is suggested that EFL teachers in universities or colleges should move from a product-based approach to a process-focused approach in their teaching of writing as the latter may contribute towards activating students' thinking and creating ideas for a writing task.","authors":["Zhenhui Rao"],"meta":["April 2007ELT Journal 61(2):100-106","DOI:10.1093/elt/ccm002"],"references":["227901898_Student_Responses_to_Learning_Strategy_Instruction_in_the_Foreign_Language_Classroom","222560828_Chinese_students'_perceptions_of_communicative_and_non-communicative_activities_in_EFL_classroom","222468246_The_skilled_use_of_interaction_strategies_Creating_a_framework_for_improved_small-group_communicative_interaction_in_the_language_classroom","222409446_Teaching_reading_strategies_and_reading_comprehension_within_a_technology-enhanced_learning_environment"]}
