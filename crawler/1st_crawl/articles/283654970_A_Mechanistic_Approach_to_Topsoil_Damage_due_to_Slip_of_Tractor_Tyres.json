{"id":"283654970_A_Mechanistic_Approach_to_Topsoil_Damage_due_to_Slip_of_Tractor_Tyres","abstract":"Tractor traction tyres interact with soil by a system of normal and tangential stresses along the soil-tyre contact surface. In this interaction both soil and tyre deform according to their own stress-strain relationships. Soil deformation results in the formation of a rut as well as in topsoil displacement along the soil-tyre contact surface. The topsoil displacement depends on shear stress which soil undergoes at contact with tyre. The shear stress-displacement relationship characterizing the soil layer which interacts with the traction tyre has been studied for a long time as it strongly affects the relationship between traction force and wheel slip, usually referred to as traction performance of the soil-wheel system (Becker, 1956; Janosi and Hanamoto, 1961; Wills, 1963; Wong and Preston-Thomas, 1983)","authors":["Andrea Battiato","Etienne Diserens","Lyesse Laloui","Luigi Sartori"],"meta":["September 2013Journal of Agricultural Science and Applications 2(3)","DOI:10.14511/jasa.2013.020305","Project: Reduction of fuel consumption by farming, a new practice-oriented Tool"],"references":["287596265_Traction_force_in_arable_farming_Agronomic_and_environmental_aspects_after_field-data_acquisition_and_modelling","267556612_Traction_force_in_arable_farming_Agronomic_and_environmental_aspects_after_field-data_acquisition_and_modelling","310830825_Off-Road_Traction_Prediction_for_Wheeled_Vehicles","309174059_In-situ_determination_of_the_fracture_point_of_an_agricultural_soil_using_the_plate_penetration_test_comparison_with_the_oedometer_method_and_validation","275573459_Traction_performance_simulation_of_a_pushedpulled_driven_wheel","270951089_Effects_of_the_stress_field_induced_by_a_running_tyre_on_the_soil_pore_system","270613451_Soil_Strength_Slope_and_Rainfall_Intensity_Effects_on_Interrill_Erosion","251515488_A_review_of_the_changes_in_the_soil_pore_system_due_to_soil_deformation_A_hydrodynamic_perspective","246028237_Effect_of_wheel_slip_on_soil_compaction","245223522_On_the_characterization_of_the_shear_stress-displacement_relationship_of_terrain"]}
