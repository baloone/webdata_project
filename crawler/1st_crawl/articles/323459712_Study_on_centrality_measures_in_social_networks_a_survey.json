{"id":"323459712_Study_on_centrality_measures_in_social_networks_a_survey","abstract":"Social networks are absolutely a useful and important place for connecting people within the world. A basic issue in a social network is to identify the key persons within it. This is why different centrality measures have been found over the years. In this survey paper, we present past and present research works on measures of centrality in social network. For this plan, we discuss mathematical definitions and different developed centrality measures. We also present some applications of centrality measures in biology, research, security, traffic, transportation, drug, class room. At last, our future research work on centrality measure is given.","authors":["Kousik Das","Sovan Samanta","Madhumangal Pal"],"meta":["February 2018Social Network Analysis and Mining 8(1)","DOI:10.1007/s13278-018-0493-2"],"references":["316187083_Centrality_Measures_to_Identify_Traffic_Congestion_on_Road_Networks_A_Case_Study_of_Sri_Lanka","315440630_Centrality_Measures_to_Identify_Traffic_Congestion_on_Road_Networks_A_Case_Study_of_Sri_Lanka","310472777_From_Structure_to_Activity_Using_Centrality_Measures_to_Predict_Neuronal_Activity","316804902_Research_on_centrality_of_urban_transport_network_nodes","313607570_The_architecture_of_complex_weighted_networks","313414448_A_novel_weight_neighborhood_centrality_algorithm_for_identifying_influential_spreaders_in_complex_networks","312982120_Centrality_indices","293482078_Network_analysis_of_substance_abuse_and_dependence_symptoms","291640583_Erratum_Network_analysis_in_the_social_sciences_Science_324_892","283471159_Identify_influential_spreaders_in_complex_networks_the_role_of_neighborhood","274836178_Understanding_Classrooms_through_Social_Network_Analysis_A_Primer_for_Social_Network_Analysis_in_Education_Research","254864655_Talking_and_learning_physics_Predicting_future_grades_from_network_measures_and_Force_Concept_Inventory_pretest_scores","264920260_Networks_An_Introduction","261011327_Ranking_the_spreading_influence_in_complex_networks","260489811_Identifying_and_ranking_influential_spreaders_in_complex_networks_by_neighborhood_coreness"]}
