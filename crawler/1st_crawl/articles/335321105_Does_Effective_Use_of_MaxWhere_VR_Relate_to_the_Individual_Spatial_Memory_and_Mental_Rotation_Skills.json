{"id":"335321105_Does_Effective_Use_of_MaxWhere_VR_Relate_to_the_Individual_Spatial_Memory_and_Mental_Rotation_Skills","abstract":"Desktop virtual realities are becoming increasingly widespread. Thus, it is important to measure if it can be really a next step in the evolution of computer science. This researched aimed to examine whether there is a relationship between the effectiveness of completing a task in MaxWhere VR and the users' cognitive characteristics: namely the spatial memory (measured by the Corsi-task) and the mental rotation ability. Thirty-one participants took part in this research and their results showed no relationship between the examined spatial abilities and work effectiveness. For navigating in the virtual space, the built-in CogiNav technology of MaxWhere was used. The participants rated their navigational experience in the virtual environment. There was no statistically significant relationship with the other measured variables. These results suggest that this VR can be used by anyone, independently from their spatial memory or mental rotation skill.","authors":["Borb√°la Berki"],"meta":["August 2019Acta Polytechnica Hungarica 16(6):41-53","DOI:10.12700/APH.16.6.2019.6.4","Project: Cognitive characteristics in the background of the effectiveness of 3D VR spaces"],"references":["332413771_Desktop_VR_as_a_Virtual_Workspace_a_Cognitive_Aspect","326326582_Factors_Contributing_to_the_Enhanced_Performance_of_the_MaxWhere_3D_VR_Platform_in_the_Distribution_of_Digital_Information","326326395_MaxWhere_VR-learning_improves_effectiveness_over_clasiccal_tools_of_e-learning","326065864_2D_Advertising_in_3D_Virtual_Spaces","312113959_Innovative_engineering_education_in_the_cooperative_VR_environment","327540568_Towards_a_Modern_Integrated_Virtual_Laboratory_System","322707403_Presentation_of_a_medieval_church_in_MaxWhere","312615288_A_cross-case_analysis_of_gender_issues_in_desktop_virtual_reality_learning_environments","311751589_Direct_manipulation_is_better_than_passive_viewing_for_learning_anatomy_in_a_three-dimensional_virtual_reality_environment","310471062_PsyToolkit_A_Novel_Web-Based_Method_for_Running_Online_Questionnaires_and_Reaction-Time_Experiments"]}
