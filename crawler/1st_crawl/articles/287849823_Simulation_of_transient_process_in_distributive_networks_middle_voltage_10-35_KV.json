Based on real scheme in the earth fault case, algorithm for positioning of earth fault place has been written. With the use of computer, this procedure can be applied for increase of operational reliability of distributive networks to voltage level of 10-35 kV.","authors":["Violeta Milicevic","Slobodan Bjelic","N.
