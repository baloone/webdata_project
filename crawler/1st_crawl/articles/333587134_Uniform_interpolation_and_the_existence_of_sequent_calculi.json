{"id":"333587134_Uniform_interpolation_and_the_existence_of_sequent_calculi","abstract":"This paper presents a uniform and modular method to prove uniform interpolation for several intermediate and intuitionistic modal logics. The proof-theoretic method uses sequent calculi that are extensions of the terminating sequent calculus G4ip for intuitionistic propositional logic. It is shown that whenever the rules in a calculus satisfy certain structural properties, the corresponding logic has uniform interpolation. It follows that the intuitionistic versions of K and KD (without the diamond operator) have uniform interpolation. It also follows that no intermediate or intuitionistic modal logic without uniform interpolation has a sequent calculus satisfying those structural properties, thereby establishing that except for the seven intermediate logics that have uniform interpolation, no intermediate logic has such a sequent calculus.","authors":["Rosalie Iemhoff"],"meta":["June 2019Annals of Pure and Applied Logic 170(11)","DOI:10.1016/j.apal.2019.05.008"],"references":["325068395_Uniform_interpolation_and_sequent_calculi_in_modal_logic","300588426_Constructive_Modalities_with_Provability_Smack","226515897_On_An_Intuitionistic_Modal_Logic","220300085_Pitts'_Quantifiers_Are_Not_Topological_Quantification","220298189_Uniform_Interpolation_and_Propositional_Quantifiers_in_Modal_Logics","38383840_On_the_Complexity_of_Propositional_Quantification_in_Intuitionistic_Logic","2858332_Extended_Curry-Howard_Correspondence_for_a_Basic_Constructive_Modal_Logic","2445282_Intuitionistic_Modal_Logic","329759473_Terminating_sequent_calculi_for_two_intuitionistic_modal_logics","317191961_Uniform_Interpolation_and_Compact_Congruences","284573490_A_constructive_propositional_calculus_with_strong_negation","271621779_Uniform_interpolation_in_substructural_logics","268489901_Sheaves_games_and_model_completions_A_categorical_approach_to_nonclassical_propositional_logics","267110675_A_new_algorithm_for_derivability_in_the_constructive_propositional_calculus","247665363_Subalgebras_of_diagonalizable_algebras_of_theories_containing_arithmetic","245812820_Craig's_theorem_in_superintuitionistic_logics_and_amalgamated_varieties_of_pseudo-Boolean_algebras","243771403_Uniform_Interpolation_and_Layered_Bisimulation","242464487_On_a_normal_form_for_intuitionistic_propositional_logic","227077262_Bounds_for_cut_elimination_in_intuitionistic_propositional_logic","227037094_Models_for_stronger_normal_intuitionistic_modal_logics","225445701_Models_for_normal_intuitionistic_modal_logics","220297639_Undefinability_of_propositional_quantifiers_in_the_modal_system_S4","38383251_Contraction-Free_Sequent_Calculi_for_Intuitionistic_Logic","31124855_An_On_log_n-Space_Decision_Procedure_for_Intuitionistic_Propositional_Logic","2825138_On_an_Interpretation_of_Second_Order_Quantification_in_First_Order_Intuitionistic_Propositional_Logic","2590079_Bisimulations_Model_Descriptions_and_Propositional_Quantifiers"]}
