VR applications provide learners with experiences that they cannot find (totally or partially) in the real world and that promote active learning. For distance learning, existing works indicate that VR offers a new way to learn, collaborate and socialize. It allows to simulate learning situations similar to those carried out in a face-to-face training (lectures, manipulation of objects in a laboratory, etc.) and gives users the freedom of interactivity with immersive features. The goal of this paper is to study a new contribution to the user experience of learners in a distance learning environment. More specifically, we show how the representation of avatars can influence the feeling of co-presence and bring learners closer together in a collaborative virtual environment.","authors":["Richard Ngu Leubou","Marc Trestini","Benoit Crespin"],"meta":["May 2021","Conference: Conf√©rence EIAH"],"references":[]}
