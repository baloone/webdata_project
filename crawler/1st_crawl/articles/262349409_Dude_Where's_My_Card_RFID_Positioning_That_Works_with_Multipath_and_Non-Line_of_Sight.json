{"id":"262349409_Dude_Where's_My_Card_RFID_Positioning_That_Works_with_Multipath_and_Non-Line_of_Sight","abstract":"RFIDs are emerging as a vital component of the Internet of Things. In 2012, billions of RFIDs have been deployed to locate equipment, track drugs, tag retail goods, etc. Current RFID systems, however, can only identify whether a tagged object is within radio range (which could be up to tens of meters), but cannot pinpoint its exact location. Past proposals for addressing this limitation rely on a line-of-sight model and hence perform poorly when faced with multipath effects or non-line-of-sight, which are typical in real-world deployments. This paper introduces the first fine-grained RFID positioning system that is robust to multipath and non-line-of-sight scenarios. Unlike past work, which considers multipath as detrimental, our design exploits multipath to accurately locate RFIDs. The intuition underlying our design is that nearby RFIDs experience a similar multipath environment (e.g., reflectors in the environment) and thus exhibit similar multipath profiles. We capture and extract these multipath profiles by using a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) created via antenna motion. We then adapt dynamic time warping (DTW) techniques to pinpoint a tag's location. We built a prototype of our design using USRP software radios. Results from a deployment of 200 commercial RFIDs in our university library demonstrate that the new design can locate misplaced books with a median accuracy of 11~cm.","authors":["Jue Wang","Dina Katabi"],"meta":["August 2013ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review 43(4):51-62","DOI:10.1145/2486001.2486029","Conference: Proceedings of the ACM SIGCOMM 2013 conference on SIGCOMMVolume: 43"],"references":["263459329_LANDMARC_Indoor_Location_Sensing_Using_Active_RFID_Pervasive_Computing_and_Communications_Guest_Editors_Mohan_Kumar_Diane_Cook_and_Anand_Tripathi","262211952_A_Reliable_and_accurate_indoor_localization_method_using_phone_inertial_sensors","235709979_Toward_Accurate_Dynamic_Time_Warping_in_Linear_Time_and_Space","228541557_SpotON_An_Indoor_3D_Location_Sensing_Technology_Based_on_RF_Signal_Strength","224236378_Bandwidth_dependence_of_CW_ranging_to_UHF_RFID_tags_in_severe_multipath_environments","224139163_Phase_based_spatial_identification_of_UHF_RFID_tags","220926350_VOR_base_stations_for_indoor_80211_positioning","220571483_Toward_accurate_dynamic_time_warping_in_linear_time_and_space","4011304_Landmarc_Indoor_location_sensing_using_active_RFID","350449175_RFID_Handbook_Fundamentals_and_Applications_in_Contactless_Smart_Cards_Radio_Frequency_Identification_and_near-Field_Communication","329182340_Handbook_of_Smart_Antennas_for_RFID_Systems","272831319_Electromagnetic_Waves_and_Antennas","265949092_Spectral_Analysis_of_Signals","262398610_ArrayTrack_A_Fine-Grained_Indoor_Location_System","262206751_PinPoint_localizing_interfering_radios","261151476_An_adaptive_map-matching_based_on_Dynamic_Time_Warping_for_pedestrian_positioning_using_network_map","254464327_Zee_zero-effort_crowdsourcing_for_indoor_localization","251617993_Using_reference_RFID_tags_for_calibrating_the_estimated_locations_of_construction_materials","247326334_RADAR_An_in-building_RF-based_user_location_and_tracking_system","246016739_EECS_224B_Fundamentals_of_Wireless_Communications","239425296_Limitations_on_Directional_Patterns_of_Phase-Compensated_Circular_Arrays","236157535_Fundamentals_of_Wireless_Communication","232700971_A_novel_method_for_UHF_RFID_tag_tracking_based_on_acceleration_data","229623207_Handbook_of_Smart_Antennas_for_RFID_Systems","224561878_Complete_Link_Budgets_for_Backscatter-Radio_and_RFID_Systems","224263376_Indoor_localisation_for_complex_building_designs_using_passive_RFID_technology","224236379_Holographic_localization_of_passive_UHF_RFID_transponders","224236368_A_software_radio-based_UHF_RFID_reader_for_PHYMAC_experimentation","224236366_New_measurement_results_for_the_localization_of_UHF_RFID_transponders_using_an_Angle_of_Arrival_AoA_approach","224139177_Accurate_localization_of_RFID_tags_using_phase_difference","220926610_Indoor_localization_without_the_pain","215722097_Synthetic_Aperture_Radar","3842777_RADAR_An_in-building_RF-based_user_location_and_tracking_system","2927221_Tracking_Moving_Devices_with_the_Cricket_Location_System","2398724_Derivative_Dynamic_Time_Warping"]}
