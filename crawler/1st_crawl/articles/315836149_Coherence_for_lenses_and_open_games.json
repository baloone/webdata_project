{"id":"315836149_Coherence_for_lenses_and_open_games","abstract":"Categories of lenses in computer science, and of open games in compositional game theory, have a structure that is intermediate between symmetric monoidal and compact closed categories. Specifically they have a family of morphisms that behave like the counits of a compact closed category, but have no corresponding units; and they have a 'partial' duality that behaves like transposition in a compact closed category when it is defined. We axiomatise this structure, which we refer to as a 'teleological category'. We precisely define a diagrammatic language suitable for these categories, and prove a coherence theorem for them. This underpins the use of diagrammatic reasoning in compositional game theory, which has previously been used only informally.","authors":["Jules Hedges"],"meta":["April 2017"],"references":["313919093_COMPOSITIONAL_GAME_THEORY","301835400_Compositionality_and_String_Diagrams_for_Game_Theory","276211451_Notions_of_Bidirectional_Computation_and_Entangled_State_Monads","265432619_The_Dialectica_categories","222417243_Dagger_Compact_Closed_Categories_and_Completely_Positive_Maps","220696266_Essentials_of_Game_Theory_A_Concise_Multidisciplinary_Introduction","45878576_Abstract_Scalars_Loops_and_Free_Traced_and_Strongly_Compact_Closed_Categories","2933653_Combinators_for_Bi-Directional_Tree_Transformations_A_Linguistic_Approach_to_the_View_Update_Problem","1893685_Framed_bicategories_and_monoidal_fibrations","325182013_Picturing_Quantum_Processes","308321922_The_Algebra_of_Open_and_Interconnected_Systems","301848651_A_compositional_approach_to_economic_game_theory","284869316_Relating_Algebraic_and_Coalgebraic_Descriptions_of_Lenses","265354140_Categories_for_the_working_mathematician_2nd_ed","259417781_Lenses_fibrations_and_universal_translations","243772753_Coherence_for_compact_closed_categories","238857942_Braided_compact_closed_categories_with_applications_to_low_dimensional_topology","228929964_The_geometry_of_tensor_calculus_II","226439373_Many-variable_functorial_calculus_I","45868699_A_Survey_of_Graphical_Languages_for_Monoidal_Categories","2124258_Categorical_Aspects_of_Topological_Quantum_Field_Theories"]}
