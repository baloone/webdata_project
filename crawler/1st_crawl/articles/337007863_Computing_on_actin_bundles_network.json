{"id":"337007863_Computing_on_actin_bundles_network","abstract":"Actin filaments are conductive to ionic currents, mechanical and voltage solitons. These travelling localisations can be utilised to generate computing circuits from actin networks. The propagation of localisations on a single actin filament is experimentally unfeasible to control. Therefore, we consider excitation waves propagating on bundles of actin filaments. In computational experiments with a two-dimensional slice of an actin bundle network we show that by using an arbitrary arrangement of electrodes, it is possible to implement two-inputs-one-output circuits.","authors":["Andrew Adamatzky","Florian Huber","Jörg Schnauß"],"meta":["November 2019Scientific Reports 9(1):15887","DOI:10.1038/s41598-019-51354-y"],"references":["337890327_Towards_Cytoskeleton_Computers_A_Proposal","334777100_Bio-Recognition_in_Spectroscopy-Based_Biosensors_for_Heavy_Metals-Water_and_Waterborne_Contamination_Analysis","333515917_Response_of_an_actin_network_in_vesicles_under_electric_pulses","330762633_On_discovering_functions_in_actin_filament_automata","327408060_Glassy_dynamics_in_composite_biopolymer_networks","320674387_Computers_from_Plants_We_Never_Made_Speculations","337470730_On_interplay_between_excitability_and_geometry","331042231_Plant_leaf_computing","323191785_Synthetic_Transient_Crosslinks_Program_the_Mechanics_of_Soft_Biopolymer-Based_Materials","321619105_Collision-Based_Computing"]}
