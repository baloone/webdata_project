{"id":"306353453_Research_impact_in_co-authorship_structures_a_two-mode_analysis","abstract":"In the context of research collaboration and co-authorship, we studied scholarsâ€™ scientific achievements and success, based on their collection of shared publications. By means of a novel regression model, which exploits the two-mode structure of co-authorship, we translated paper scientific impact into author professional achievement, to simultaneously account for the effect of paper properties (access status, funding bodies, etc.) as well as author demographic and behavioral characteristics (gender, nationality) on academic success and impact. After a detailed analysis of the proposed statistical procedure, we illustrated our approach with an empirical analysis of a co-authorship network based on 1007 scientific articles.","authors":["Tahereh Dehdarirad","Stefano Nasini"],"meta":["May 2017Journal of Informetrics 11(2):371-388","DOI:10.1016/j.joi.2017.02.002"],"references":["306356177_Conditionally_exponential_random_models_for_individual_properties_and_network_structures_Method_and_application","288830411_On_the_Compliance_of_Women_Engineers_with_a_Gendered_Scientific_System","273951820_Is_Quality_and_Completeness_of_Reporting_of_Systematic_Reviews_and_Meta-Analyses_Published_in_High_Impact_Radiology_Journals_Associated_with_Citation_Rates","273145755_Structure_and_evolution_of_co-authorship_network_in_an_interdisciplinary_research_field","272497050_Is_There_a_Relationship_between_Research_Sponsorship_and_Publication_Impact_An_Analysis_of_Funding_Acknowledgments_in_Nanotechnology_Papers","272477835_When_does_brokerage_matter_Citation_impact_of_research_teams_in_an_emerging_academic_field","295859996_Simulating_Knowledge_Dynamics_in_Innovation_Networks","294577114_Factors_affecting_number_of_citations_a_comprehensive_review_of_the_literature","286508344_Citation_Prediction_in_Heterogeneous_Bibliographic_Networks","275897880_Mathematical_programming_approaches_for_classes_of_random_network_problems"]}
