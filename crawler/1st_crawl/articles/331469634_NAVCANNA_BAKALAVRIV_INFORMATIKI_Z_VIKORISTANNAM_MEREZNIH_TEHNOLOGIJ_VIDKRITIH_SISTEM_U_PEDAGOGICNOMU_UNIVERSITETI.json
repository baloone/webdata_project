The theoretical principles of the use of OSNTs in higher educational institutions are defined and the basic concepts of the study are analyzed. The procedural model of the use of OSNTs in training of future bachelors of computer science is theoretically grounded and developed. The criteria, indicators and levels of competence of bachelors of computer science concerning the use of OSNTs are defined and the model of its formation is developed. The main components of OSNTs using technique for future bachelors of computer science are described and its effectiveness is experimentally verified. The experimental implementation of the study results showed that the use of OSNTs in training of bachelors of computer science based on the developed technique promotes the competence formation of bachelors of computer science concerning the use of OSNTs.","authors":["Tetiana Ya.
