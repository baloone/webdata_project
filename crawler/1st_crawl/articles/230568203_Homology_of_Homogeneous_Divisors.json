{"id":"230568203_Homology_of_Homogeneous_Divisors","abstract":"One deals with arbitrary reduced free divisors in a polynomial ring over a\nfield of characteristic zero, by stressing the ideal theoretic and homological\nbehavior of the corresponding singular locus. A particular emphasis is given to\nboth weighted homogeneous and homogeneous polynomials, allowing to introduce\nnew families of free divisors which do not come from hyperplane arrangements\nnor as explicit discriminants from singularity theory.","authors":["Aron Simis","Stefan O.
