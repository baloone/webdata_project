{"id":"235949866_Aalst_WMP_Business_process_management_a_comprehensive_survey_ISRN_Softw_Eng_1-37","abstract":"Business Process Management (BPM) research resulted in a plethora\nof methods, techniques, and tools to support the design, enactment, management,\nand analysis of operational business processes. This survey aims to structure these\nresults and provide an overview of the state-of-the-art in BPM. In BPM the concept\nof a process model is fundamental. Process models may be used to configure\ninformation systems, but may also be used to analyze, understand, and improve\nthe processes they describe. Hence, the introduction of BPM technology has both\nmanagerial and technical ramifications and may enable significant productivity\nimprovements, cost savings, and flow-time reductions. The practical relevance of\nBPM and rapid developments over the last decade justify a comprehensive survey.","authors":["Wil Van der Aalst"],"meta":["January 2013","DOI:10.1155/2013/507984"],"references":["313676723_Merging_business_process_models","313388353_How_much_language_is_enough_theoretical_and_practical_use_of_the_business_process_modeling_notation","279896778_Rediscovering_Workflow_Models_from_Event-Based_Data_using_Little_Thumb","266363371_Interorganizational_Workflows_An_Approach_Based_on_Message_Sequence_Charts_and_Petri_Nets","322303050_Towards_formal_analysis_of_artifact-centric_business_process_models","313096288_From_public_views_to_private_views_-_Correctness-by-design_for_services","312596137_Big_data_The_next_frontier_for_innovation_competition_and_productivity","305114055_Graph_matching_algorithms_for_business_process_model_similarity_search","297708352_Workshop_on_Enterprise_and_Organizational_Modeling_and_Simulation_EOMAS","285331061_Use_of_production_system_for_modelling_asychronous_concurrent_processes_in_Pattern-Directed_Inference_Systems"]}
