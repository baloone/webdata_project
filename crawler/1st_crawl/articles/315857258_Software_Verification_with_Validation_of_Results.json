{"id":"315857258_Software_Verification_with_Validation_of_Results","abstract":"This report describes the 2017 Competition on Software Verification (SV-COMP), the 6\\(^{\\text {th}}\\) edition of the annual thorough comparative evaluation of fully-automatic software verifiers. The goal is to reflect the current state of the art in software verification in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. The major achievement of the 6\\(^{\\text {th}}\\) edition of SV-COMP is that the verification results were validated in most categories. The verifiers have to produce verification witnesses, which contain hints that a validator can later use to reproduce the verification result. The answer of a verifier counts only if the validator confirms the verification result. SV-COMP uses two independent, publicly available witness validators. For 2017, a new category structure was introduced that now orders the verification tasks according to the property to verify on the top level, and by the type of programs (e.g., which kind of data types are used) on a second level. The categories Overflows and Termination were heavily extended, and the category SoftwareSystems now contains also verification tasks from the software system BusyBox. The competition used 8 908 verification tasks that each consisted of a C program and a property (reachability, memory safety, termination). SV-COMP 2017 had 32 participating verification systems from 12 countries.","authors":["Dirk Beyer"],"meta":["March 2017Lecture Notes in Computer Science","DOI:10.1007/978-3-662-54580-5_20","Conference: International Conference on Tools and Algorithms for the Construction and Analysis of Systems"],"references":["316084048_Lazy-CSeq_20_combining_lazy_sequentialization_with_abstract_interpretation_Competition_contribution","315864681_Skink_Static_Analysis_of_Programs_in_LLVM_Intermediate_Representation","315861847_Lazy-CSeq_20_Combining_Lazy_Sequentialization_with_Abstract_Interpretation","300078496_2LS_for_Program_Analysis","299426870_MU-CSeq_04_individual_memory_location_unwindings_competition_contribution","284570715_Handling_loops_in_bounded_model_checking_of_C_programs_via_k-induction","283118983_Termination_Competition_termCOMP_2015","281410049_Lazy-CSeq_A_Context-Bounded_Model_Checking_Tool_for_Multi-threaded_C-Programs","262363179_Predicate_analysis_with_BLAST_27","237143859_The_RERS_Grey-Box_Challenge_2012_Analysis_of_Event-Condition-Action_Systems","349476847_Ultimate_Taipan_trace_abstraction_and_abstract_interpretation_competition_contribution","315864778_Optimizing_and_Caching_SMT_Queries_in_SymDIVINE","315863973_HipTNT_A_Termination_and_Non-termination_Analyzer_by_Second-Order_Abduction","315862139_Forester_From_Heap_Shapes_to_Automata_Predicates","315860365_Ultimate_Taipan_Trace_Abstraction_and_Abstract_Interpretation","315859525_Ultimate_Automizer_with_an_On-Demand_Construction_of_Floyd-Hoare_Automata","315859069_AProVE_Proving_and_Disproving_Termination_of_Memory-Manipulating_C_Programs","315858886_CPA-BAM-BnB_Block-Abstraction_Memoization_and_Region-Based_Memory_Models_for_Predicate_Abstractions","315857525_Symbiotic_4_Beyond_Reachability","315857474_VeriAbs_Verification_by_Abstraction_Competition_Contribution","315857349_DepthK_A_k-Induction_Verifier_Based_on_Invariant_Inference_for_C_Programs","309613956_Correctness_witnesses_exchanging_verification_results_between_verifiers","308496558_Lazy_Sequentialization_for_the_Safety_Verification_of_Unbounded_Concurrent_Programs","301975852_ULTIMATE_KOJAK_with_Memory_Safety_Checks","300541540_Benchmarking_and_Resource_Measurement","300078495_CIVL_Applying_a_General_Concurrency_Verification_Framework_to_CPthreads_Programs_Competition_Contribution","300078493_Reliable_and_Reproducible_Competition_Results_with_BenchExec_and_Witnesses_Report_on_SV-COMP_2016","300077937_Optimized_PredatorHP_and_the_SV-COMP_Heap_and_Memory_Safety_Benchmark","300077796_MU-CSeq_04_Individual_Memory_Location_Unwindings","297582654_CBMC_-_C_Bounded_Model_Checker","290878712_SMACK_Decoupling_Source_Language_Details_from_Verifier_Implementations","290851484_ESBMC_122","283653456_Software_verification_and_verifiable_witnesses_Report_on_SV-COMP_2015","283006857_VerifyThis_2012","281589369_Witness_Validation_and_Stepwise_Testification_across_Software_Verifiers","280499550_Boosting_k-Induction_with_Continuously-Refined_Invariants","271771739_Combining_k-Induction_with_Continuously-Refined_Invariants","262601560_Status_Report_on_Software_Verification_Competition_Summary_SV-COMP_2014","262601356_Second_Competition_on_Software_Verification_Summary_of_SV-COMP_2013","255566670_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science"]}
