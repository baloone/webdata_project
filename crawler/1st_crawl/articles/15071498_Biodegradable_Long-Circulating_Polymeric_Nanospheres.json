{"id":"15071498_Biodegradable_Long-Circulating_Polymeric_Nanospheres","abstract":"Injectable nanoparticulate carriers have important potential applications such as site-specific drug delivery or medical imaging.\nConventional carriers, however, cannot generally be used because they are eliminated by the reticulo-endothelial system within\nseconds or minutes after intravenous injection. To address these limitations, monodisperse biodegradable nanospheres were\ndeveloped from amphiphilic copolymers composed of two biocompatible blocks. The nanospheres exhibited dramatically increased\nblood circulation times and reduced liver accumulation in mice. Furthermore, they entrapped up to 45 percent by weight of\nthe drug in the dense core in a one-step procedure and could be freeze-dried and easily redispersed without additives in aqueous\nsolutions.","authors":["Ruxandra Gref","Yoshiharu Minamitake","Maria Teresa Peracchia","V.â€…S.
