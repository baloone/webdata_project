{"id":"262323044_Coherent_Intrinsic_Images_from_Photo_Collections","abstract":"An intrinsic image is a decomposition of a photo into an illumination layer and a reflectance layer, which enables powerful editing such as the alteration of an object's material independently of its illumination. However, decomposing a single photo is highly under-constrained and existing methods require user assistance or handle only simple scenes. In this paper, we compute intrinsic decompositions using several images of the same scene under different viewpoints and lighting conditions. We use multi-view stereo to automatically reconstruct 3D points and normals from which we derive relationships between reflectance values at different locations, across multiple views and consequently different lighting conditions. We use robust estimation to reliably identify reflectance ratios between pairs of points. From these, we infer constraints for our optimization and enforce a coherent solution across multiple views and illuminations. Our results demonstrate that this constrained optimization yields high-quality and coherent intrinsic decompositions of complex scenes. We illustrate how these decompositions can be used for image-based illumination transfer and transitions between views with consistent lighting.","authors":["Pierre-Yves Laffont","Adrien Bousseau","Sylvain Paris","Fr√©do Durand"],"meta":["November 2012ACM Transactions on Graphics 31(6)","DOI:10.1145/2366145.2366221"],"references":["319770714_Photo_tourism_Exploring_photo_collections_in_3D","319770557_Finding_paths_through_the_world's_photos","318779988_User-Assisted_Intrinsic_Images","314450671_Relighting_objects_from_image_collections","314410006_Factored_time-lapse_video","313088163_Physically_based_rendering_From_theory_to_implementation_Third_edition","263338773_Silhouette-Aware_Warping_for_Image-Based_Rendering","261846065_Intrinsic_Images_by_Clustering","258304846_Estimation_of_Intrinsic_Image_Sequences_from_ImageDepth_Video","247684152_Surface_reconstruction_from_unorganized_points_SIGGRAPH_Computer_Graphics_262_71-78"]}
