{"id":"221479871_On_using_voice_source_measures_in_automatic_gender_classification_of_children's_speech","abstract":"Acoustic characteristics of speech signals differ with gender due to physiological differences of the glottis and the vocal tract. Previous research (1) showed that adding the voice-source re- lated measures H 1 H 2 and H 1 A 3 improved gender classi- fication accuracy compared to using only the fundamental fre- quency (F0) and formant frequencies. H i refers to the i-th source spectral harmonic magnitude, and A i refers to the mag- nitude of the source spectrum at the i-th formant. In this pa- per, three other voice source related measures: CPP, HNR and H 2 H 4 are used in gender classification of children's voices. CPP refers to the Cepstral Peak Prominence (2), HNR refers to the harmonic-to-noise ratio (3), and H 2 H 4 refers to the dif- ference between the 2nd and the 4th source spectral harmonic magnitudes. Results show that using these three features im- proves gender classification accuracy compared with (1).
