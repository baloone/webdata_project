{"id":"23992461_Investments_in_ICT-capital_and_economic_performance_of_small_and_medium_scale_enterprises_in_East_Africa","abstract":"In this paper, we focused on whether investments in ICTs could cause any increases in a firm's performance. We constructed a data set for two East African countries-Kenya and Tanzania for small and medium scale enterprises and focused on three performance indicators-internal rate of return, labour productivity and domestic and export market expansion. Findings of this paper suggested that investments in ICT have a positive impact on general market expansion. However, it has a negative impact on labour productivity, and such investment does not have any significant impact on the firm's return nor does it determine the firm's exporter (non-exporter) status.
