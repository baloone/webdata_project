{"id":"285544567_Motivation_Interventions_in_Education_A_Meta-Analytic_Review","abstract":"This meta-analysis provides an extensive and organized summary of intervention\nstudies in education that are grounded in motivation theory. We identified\n74 published and unpublished papers that experimentally manipulated\nan independent variable and measured an authentic educational outcome\nwithin an ecologically valid educational context. Our analyses included 92\nindependent effect sizes with 38,377 participants. Our results indicated that\ninterventions were generally effective, with an average mean effect size of\nd = 0.49 (95% confidence interval = [0.43, 0.56]). Although there were\ndescriptive differences in the effect sizes across several moderator variables\nconsidered in our analyses, the only significant difference found was for the\ntype of experimental design, with randomized designs having smaller effect\nsizes than quasi-experimental designs. This work illustrates the extent to\nwhich interventions and accompanying theories have been tested via experimental\nmethods and provides information about appropriate next steps in\ndeveloping and testing effective motivation interventions in education.","authors":["Rory Lazowski","Chris Hulleman"],"meta":["December 2015Review of Educational Research 86(2)","DOI:10.3102/0034654315617832"],"references":["319793952_Conducting_social_psychological_research_in_educational_settings_Lessons_we_learned_in_school","295097925_Creating_Birds_of_Similar_Feathers_Leveraging_Similarity_to_Improve_Teacher-Student_Relationships_and_Academic_Achievement","323424582_Statistical_power_analysis_for_the_behavioral_sciences","316807278_Intrinsic_Motivation_and_Self-Determination_in_Human_Behavior","304833950_Interest_and_Its_Contribution_as_a_Mental_Resource_for_Learning","303751694_Legislating_competence_High-stakes_testing_policies_and_their_relations_with_psychological_theories_and_research","303249251_Development_of_achievement_motivation","292031781_Fixed-effect_versus_random-effects_models_Introduction_to_meta-analysis","289963122_Academic_Achievement_Motivation_Development_of","285211052_Encouraging_Student_Interest_in_Science_and_Technology_Studies","285151908_Grey_literature","284531959_Statistical_Methods_for_Meta-Analysis","283550903_Quantifying_heterogeneity_in_a_metaanalysis","281345602_Design-based_research_An_emerging_paradigm_for_educational_inquiry","281345377_IBM_SPSS_statistics_for_windows_version_200"]}
