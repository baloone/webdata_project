{"id":"226528876_Quaternionic_Determinants","abstract":"The classical matrix groups are of fundamental importance in many parts of geometry and algebra. Some of them, like Sp(n), are most conceptually defined as groups of quaternionic matrices. But, the quaternions not being commutative, we must reconsider some aspects of linear algebra. In particular, it is not clear how to define the determinant of a quaternionic matrix. Over the years, many people have given different definitions. In this article I will discuss some of these.","authors":["Helmer Aslaksen"],"meta":["June 1996The Mathematical Intelligencer 18(3):57-65","DOI:10.1007/BF03024312"],"references":["316824330_A_History_of_Algebra","316270255_Matrix_Groups","309100522_mathrmSO2_invariants_of_a_set_of_2_times_2_matrices","301928911_Definition_of_determinant_and_Cramer_solutions_over_quaternion_field","291049212_On_the_determinant_of_an_Hermitian_matrix_of_quaternionic_elements","285916271_Quaternion_determinants","285732912_Les_dterminants_sur_un_corps_non_commutatif","285330449_Normal_Semi-Linear_Transformations","275810227_The_Impossibility_of_a_Division_Algebra_of_Vectors_in_Three_Dimensional_Space","268939082_Hypercomplex_determinants"]}
