{"id":"51240369_Brain-Computer_Interface_Based_on_Generation_of_Visual_Images","abstract":"This paper examines the task of recognizing EEG patterns that correspond to performing three mental tasks: relaxation and imagining of two types of pictures: faces and houses. The experiments were performed using two EEG headsets: BrainProducts ActiCap and Emotiv EPOC. The Emotiv headset becomes widely used in consumer BCI application allowing for conducting large-scale EEG experiments in the future. Since classification accuracy significantly exceeded the level of random classification during the first three days of the experiment with EPOC headset, a control experiment was performed on the fourth day using ActiCap. The control experiment has shown that utilization of high-quality research equipment can enhance classification accuracy (up to 68% in some subjects) and that the accuracy is independent of the presence of EEG artifacts related to blinking and eye movement. This study also shows that computationally-inexpensive bayesian classifier based on covariance matrix analysis yields similar classification accuracy in this problem as a more sophisticated Multi-class Common Spatial Patterns (MCSP) classifier.","authors":["Pavel Bobrov","Alexander Frolov","Charles Cantor","Irina Fedulova"],"meta":["June 2011PLoS ONE 6(6):e20674","DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0020674","SourcePubMed"],"references":["296418577_Brain-computer_interfaces_-_Communication_with_the_P300","225992971_Brain-Computer_Interfacing_and_Games","224330976_Filter_Bank_Common_Spatial_Pattern_FBCSP_in_brain-computer_interface","314464516_Bayesian_reconstruction_of_perceptual_experiences_from_human_brain_activity","285773466_Control_of_a_two-dimensional_movement_signal_by_a_noninvasive_brain-computer_interface_in_humans","254766993_Electroencephalography_basic_principles_clinical_applications_and_related","241115044_P210_Brain_oscillatory_activity_during_motor_imagery_in_electroencephalography_functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging_coregistration","238625098_On_the_Algorithmic_Implementation_of_Multiclass_Kernel-based_Vector_Machines","235990488_The_MindGame_A_P300-based_brain-computer_interface_game","223261573_Berlin_Brain-Computer_Interface-The_HCI_communication_channel_for_discovery"]}
