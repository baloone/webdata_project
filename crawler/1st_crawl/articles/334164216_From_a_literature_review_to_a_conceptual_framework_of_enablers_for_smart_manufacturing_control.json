{"id":"334164216_From_a_literature_review_to_a_conceptual_framework_of_enablers_for_smart_manufacturing_control","abstract":"When cyber-physical systems (CPS) are connected to perform smart manufacturing, we have a cyber-physical production system (CPPS). In such systems, CPS collaborate in an intelligent way to obtain and maintain the optimum of the manufacturing process, handle disturbances and adapt to changing conditions. This work, based on a systematic literature review, shows current trends in cyber-physical production systems with a special focus on the role of connectivity and control systems in production. We are looking for the enablers of CPPS focusing on the current evolution of control systems in the smart factory of the future. As a result, a conceptual framework as well as a CPPS control system architecture for the introduction and organisation of enablers for CPPS is presented to support practitioners in the realisation of smart manufacturing control concepts.","authors":["Rafael A.
