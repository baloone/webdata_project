{"id":"220873208_Sentiment_Polarity_Identification_in_Financial_News_A_Cohesion-based_Approach","abstract":"Text is not unadulterated fact. A text can make you laugh or cry but can it also make you short sell your stocks in company A and buy up options in company B? Research in the domain of finance strongly suggests that it can. Studies have shown that both the informational and affective aspects of news text affect the markets in profound ways, im- pacting on volumes of trades, stock prices, volatility and even future firm earnings. This paper aims to explore a computable metric of positive or negative polarity in financial news text which is consistent with human judgments and can be used in a quantita- tive analysis of news sentiment impact on fi- nancial markets. Results from a preliminary evaluation are presented and discussed.","authors":["Ann Devitt","Khurshid Ahmad"],"meta":["January 2007","SourceDBLP","Conference: ACL 2007, Proceedings of the 45th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, June 23-30, 2007, Prague, Czech Republic"],"references":["248832100_Thumbs_Up_or_Thumbs_Down_Semantic_Orientation_Applied_to_Unsupervised_Classification_of_Reviews","228889549_Determining_the_sentiment_of_opinions","228660613_Automatic_detection_of_opinion_bearing_words_and_sentences","221510279_Coupling_Niche_Browsers_and_Affect_Analysis_for_an_Opinion_Mining_Application","220168839_Developing_Affective_Lexical_Resources","289821968_THE_DICTIONARY_OF_AFFECT_IN_LANGUAGE","247504646_Imagery_Affect_and_Financial_Judgment","228928193_Long-Term_Capital_Management_and_the_Sociology_of_Arbitrage","221995866_WordNet_An_Electronic_Lexical_Database","220017639_Content_Analysis_An_Introduction_To_Its_Methodology"]}
