{"id":"262323499_Eye-Tracking_the_Factors_of_Process_Model_Comprehension_Tasks","abstract":"Understanding business process models has been previously related to various factors. Those factors were determined using statistical approaches either on model repositories or on experiments based on comprehension questions. We noticed that, when asking comprehension questions on a process model, usually the expert explores only a part of the entire model to provide the answer. This paper formalizes this observation under the notion of Relevant Region. We conduct an experiment using eye-tracking to prove that the Relevant Region is indeed correlated to the answer given to the comprehension question. We also give evidence that it is possible to predict whether the correct answer will be given to a comprehension question, knowing the number and the time spent fixating Relevant Region elements. This paper sets the foundations for future improvements on model comprehension research and practice.","authors":["Razvan Petrusel","Jan Mendling"],"meta":["June 2013","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-38709-8_15","Conference: Proceedings of the 25th international conference on Advanced Information Systems Engineering"],"references":["313388353_How_much_language_is_enough_theoretical_and_practical_use_of_the_business_process_modeling_notation","264195865_The_Influence_of_Notational_Deficiencies_on_Process_Model_Comprehension","262311198_Understanding_Business_Process_Models_The_Costs_and_Benefits_of_Structuredness","258100554_Process_Model_Comprehension_The_Effects_of_Cognitive_Abilities_Learning_Style_and_Strategy","257015917_Factors_of_process_model_comprehension-Findings_from_a_series_of_experiments","254913339_Eye_Tracking_A_Comprehensive_Guide_To_Methods_And_Measures","252083119_Cognitive_Load_Measurement_as_a_Means_to_Advance_Cognitive_Load_Theory","245024873_A_Visualization_Approach_for_Difference_Analysis_of_Process_Models_and_Instance_Traffic","236860229_How_to_Measure_the_Control-flow_Complexity_of_Web_processes_and_Workflows","235264107_Measurement_in_business_processes_A_systematic_review","233792055_Investigating_the_Process_of_Process_Modeling_with_Eye_Movement_Analysis","226715897_On_Structured_Workflow_Modelling","224226269_Managing_Process_Model_Complexity_via_Concrete_Syntax_Modifications","224192932_A_Study_Into_the_Factors_That_Influence_the_Understandability_of_Business_Process_Models","224185135_An_eye_tracking_study_on_the_effects_of_layout_in_understanding_the_role_of_design_patterns","222694111_Seven_Process_Modeling_Guidelines_7PMG","222500586_Computer_interface_evaluation_using_eye_movements_Methods_and_constructs","221607648_A_hybrid_learning_system_for_recognizing_user_tasks_from_desktop_activities_and_email_messages","221470905_Reducing_the_cognitive_complexity_of_business_process_models","221448531_Unraveling_Unstructured_Process_Models","220921190_Cognitive_Complexity_in_Business_Process_Modeling","220921166_Analysis_and_Validation_of_Control-Flow_Complexity_Measures_with_BPMN_Process_Models","220811146_Identifying_fixations_and_saccades_in_eye-tracking_protocols","220444832_Causal_Behavioural_Profiles_--_Efficient_Computation_Applications_and_Evaluation","220427996_A_framework_for_empirical_evaluation_of_conceptual_modeling_techniques","220422224_Why_Looking_Isn't_Always_Seeing_Readership_Skills_and_Graphical_Programming","220385084_Structuredness_and_its_significance_for_correctness_of_process_models","319393666_Modern_Information_Retrieval","313103174_Influence_factors_of_understanding_business_process_models","309314997_Applied_Logistic_Regression","309075178_Applied_Logistic_Regression","265166265_Applied_Logistic_Regressio","262176991_Making_the_case_for_measuring_mental_effort","259634241_Querying_process_models_by_behavior_inclusion","259141500_A_linear_time_layout_algorithm_for_business_process_models","236005698_Highlighting_items_as_means_of_adaptive_assistance","231244219_Quality_indicators_for_business_process_models_from_a_gateway_complexity_perspective","230786785_Eye_fixations_and_cognitive_processes1_2","228750185_Automated_Eye-Movement_Protocol_Analysis","224090141_The_Physics_of_Notations_Toward_a_Scientific_Basis_for_Constructing_Visual_Notations_in_Software_Engineering","223509876_Refactoring_large_process_model_repositories","222567777_An_eye_tracking_comparison_of_external_pointing_cues_and_internal_continuous_cues_in_learning_with_complex_animations","222428392_Eye-tracking_for_user_modeling_in_exploratory_learning_environments_An_empirical_evaluation","221586204_On_Measuring_the_Understandability_of_Process_Models","221584154_The_Impact_of_Secondary_Notation_on_Process_Model_Understanding","221276242_Eye_Tracking_Experiments_in_Business_Process_Modeling_Agenda_Setting_and_Proof_of_Concept","220695136_Eye_Tracking_Methodology_Theory_and_Practice","220692020_Eye_Tracking_Methodology_Theory_and_Practice","220610117_Business_process_model_repositories_-_Framework_and_survey","220503810_Human_and_automatic_modularizations_of_process_models_to_enhance_their_comprehension","220350445_Process_Instantiation","220268129_Tracing_the_Process_of_Process_Modeling_with_Modeling_Phase_Diagrams","220259945_Do_Ontological_Deficiencies_in_Modeling_Grammars_Matter","220102180_Soundness_of_workflow_nets_Classification_decidability_and_analysis","220196517_Syntax_highlighting_in_business_process_models"]}
