{"id":"305388936_The_Influence_of_Canalization_on_the_Robustness_of_Boolean_Networks","abstract":"Time- and state-discrete dynamical systems are frequently used to model molecular networks. This paper provides a collection of mathematical and computational tools for the study of robustness in Boolean network models. The focus is on networks governed by $k$-canalizing functions, a recently introduced class of Boolean functions that contains the well-studied class of nested canalizing functions. The activities and sensitivity of a function quantify the impact of input changes on the function output. This paper generalizes the latter concept to $c$-sensitivity and provides formulas for the activities and $c$-sensitivity of general $k$-canalizing functions as well as canalizing functions with more precisely defined structure. A popular measure for the robustness of a network, the Derrida value, can be expressed as a weighted sum of the $c$-sensitivities of the governing canalizing functions, and can also be calculated for a stochastic extension of Boolean networks. These findings provide a computationally efficient way to obtain Derrida values of Boolean networks, deterministic or stochastic, that does not involve simulation.","authors":["Claus Kadelka","Jack Kuipers","Reinhard Laubenbacher"],"meta":["July 2017Physica D Nonlinear Phenomena 353-354","DOI:10.1016/j.physd.2017.05.002"],"references":["284024691_Europhys_Lett","280124651_Difference_equation_for_tracking_perturbations_in_systems_of_Boolean_nested_canalyzing_functions","236072363_Canalization_and_Control_in_Automata_Networks_Body_Segmentation_in_Drosophila_melanogaster","225278574_Modeling_Stochasticity_and_Variability_in_Gene_Regulatory_Networks","45849823_Perturbation_propagation_in_random_and_evolved_Boolean_networks","45163742_Evolution_of_overlaps_between_configurations_in_random_Boolean_networks","10575827_The_role_of_certain_Post_classes_in_Boolean_network_models_of_genetic_networks","8975318_Random_Boolean_Network_Models_and_the_Yeast_Transcriptional_Network","8662490_The_Yeast_Cell-Cycle_Network_Is_Robustly_Designed","8387911_Activities_and_Sensitivities_in_Boolean_Network_Models","8199320_Biological_Robustness","8156020_Genetic_Networks_with_Canalyzing_Boolean_Rules_are_Always_Stable","5602712_Gene_Expression_Dynamics_in_the_Macrophage_Exhibit_Criticality","5550214_Boolean_Network_Model_Predicts_Cell_Cycle_Sequence_of_Fission_Yeast","5295289_Critical_Dynamics_in_Genetic_Regulatory_Networks_Examples_from_Four_Kingdoms","5247304_Inference_of_Boolean_Networks_Using_Sensitivity_Regularization","288233308_Boolean_formalisation_of_genetic_control_circuits","275669873_Stratification_and_enumeration_of_Boolean_functions_by_canalizing_depth","257866934_Phase_transition_of_Boolean_networks_with_partially_nested_canalizing_functions","250793786_Order_or_chaos_in_Boolean_gene_networks_depends_on_the_mean_fraction_of_canalizing_functions","248603444_Metabolic_stability_and_epigenesis_in_randomly_constructed_genetic_J","245603410_Canalization_of_Development_and_the_Inheritance_of_Acquired_Characters","234830080_Canalization_of_development_and_the_inheritance_of_acquired_characters","230912027_Random_Networks_of_Automata_A_Simple_Annealed_Approximation","229061593_Biological_robustness","228017064_Random_Boolean_Networks","224825333_Boolean_nested_canalizing_functions_A_comprehensive_analysis","222712643_Complex_networks_Structure_and_dynamics","222610119_The_average_sensitivity_of_bounded-depth_circuits","220617172_Upper_and_Lower_Time_Bounds_for_Parallel_Random_Access_Machines_without_Simultaneous_Writes","51975435_Mean-field_Boolean_network_model_of_a_signal_transduction_network","51851898_Nested_Canalyzing_Depth_and_Network_Stability","51600654_Regulatory_patterns_in_molecular_interaction_networks","37811236_Exploring_Complex_Networks","18578234_Boolean_formalization_of_genetic_control_circuits","18569963_The_Large_Scale_Structure_and_Dynamics_of_Gene_Control_Circuits_An_Ensemble_Approach","17383444_Metabolic_Stability_and_Epigenisis_in_Randomly_Connected_Genetic_Nets","10729727_The_topology_of_the_regulatory_interactions_predics_the_expression_pattern_of_the_segment_polarity_genes_in_Drosophila_melanogaster","5416147_Nested_Canalyzing_Unate_Cascade_and_Polynomial_Functions","2524223_The_topology_and_signature_of_the_regulatory_interactions_predict_the_expression_pattern_of_the_segment_polarity_genes_in_Drosophila_rnelanogaster"]}
