{"id":"335512236_Preventing_Shoulder-Surfing_Attacks_using_Digraph_Substitution_Rules_and_Pass-Image_Output_Feedback","abstract":"In this paper, we focus on methods to prevent shoulder-surfing attacks. We initially adopted digraph substitution rules from PlayFair cipher as our proposed method. PlayFair cipher is a modern cryptography method, which exists at the intersection of the disciplines of mathematics and computer science. However, according to our preliminary study it was insufficient to prevent shoulder-surfing attacks. Thus, a new method had to be proposed. In this new proposed method, we improvised the digraph substitution rules and used these rules together with an output feedback method to determine a pass-image. Our proposed method was evaluated with a user study. The results showed our proposed method was robust against both direct observation and video-recorded shoulder-surfing attacks.","authors":["Yee Lip Por","Chin Soon Ku","Tan Fong Ang"],"meta":["August 2019Symmetry 11(9):1087","DOI:10.3390/sym11091087"],"references":["343281755_A_review_of_the_recognition-based_graphical_password","313770062_Graphical_password_Prevent_shoulder-surfing_attack_using_digraph_substitution_rules","279806641_A_SURVEY_ON_SECURE_VIRTUAL_PASSWORD_AND_PHISHING_ATTACK","266005342_Frequency_of_Occurrence_Analysis_Attack_and_Its_Countermeasure","263744705_Preventing_Shoulder-Surfing_Attack_with_the_Concept_of_Concealing_the_Password_Objects'_Information","324142009_Improved_keylogging_and_shoulder-surfing_resistant_visual_two-factor_authentication_protocol","317263107_EvoPass_Evolvable_graphical_password_against_shoulder-surfing_attacks","316611572_Critical_analysis_of_2-dimensional_graphical_authentication_systems","276124799_Comparison_of_Graphical_Password_Authentication_Techniques","276019571_A_survey_on_the_use_of_graphical_passwords_in_security"]}
