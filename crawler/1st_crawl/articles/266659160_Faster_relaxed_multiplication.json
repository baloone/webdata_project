{"id":"266659160_Faster_relaxed_multiplication","abstract":"In previous work, we have introduced several fast algorithms for relaxed power series multiplication (also known under the name on-line multiplication) up till a given order n. The fastest currently known algorithm works over an effective base field K with sufficiently many 2^p-th roots of unity and has algebraic time complexity O(n log n exp (2 sqrt (log 2 log log n))). In this note, we will generalize this algorithm to the cases when K is replaced by an effective ring of positive characteristic or by an effective ring of characteristic zero, which is also torsion-free as a Z-module and comes with an additional algorithm for partial division by integers. We will also present an asymptotically faster algorithm for relaxed multiplication of p-adic numbers.","authors":["Joris van der Hoeven"],"meta":["July 2014","DOI:10.1145/2608628.2608657","Conference: Proceedings of the International Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic Computation, ISSAC"],"references":["284318306_On_primitive_elements_in_finite_fields_and_on_elliptic_curves","303491014_Searching_for_primitive_roots_in_finite_fields","273480363_A_simple_and_fast_online_power_series_multiplication_and_its_analysis","266595082_On_the_Minimum_Computation_Time_of_Functions","264945958_Modern_Computer_Algebra","264398058_The_Chirp_z-Transform_Algorithm_and_Its_Application","262361857_Relaxed_p-adic_Hensel_lifting_for_algebraic_systems","242575050_Polynomial_and_matrix_computations","238770155_The_complexity_of_a_scheme_of_functional_elements_realizing_the_multiplication_of_integers","234785046_Fast_Algorithms_for_Manipulating_Formal_Power_Series"]}
