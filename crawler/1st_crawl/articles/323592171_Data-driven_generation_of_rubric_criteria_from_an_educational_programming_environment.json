{"id":"323592171_Data-driven_generation_of_rubric_criteria_from_an_educational_programming_environment","abstract":"We demonstrate that, by using a small set of hand-graded student work, we can automatically generate rubric criteria with a high degree of validity, and that a predictive model incorporating these rubric criteria is more accurate than a previously reported model. We present this method as one approach to addressing the often challenging problem of grading assignments in programming environments. A classic solution is creating unit-tests that the student-generated program must pass, but the rigid, structured nature of unit-tests is suboptimal for assessing the more open-ended assignments students encounter in introductory programming environments like Alice. Furthermore, the creation of unit-tests requires predicting the various ways a student might correctly solve a problem - a challenging and time-intensive process. The current study proposes an alternative, semi-automated method for generating rubric criteria using low-level data from the Alice programming environment.","authors":["Nicholas Diana","Michael Eagle","John Stamper","Shuchi Grover"],"meta":["March 2018","DOI:10.1145/3170358.3170399","Conference: the 8th International Conference"],"references":["314106424_An_instructor_dashboard_for_real-time_analytics_in_interactive_programming_assignments","283228265_Are_automated_assessment_tools_helpful_in_programming_courses","254006849_The_fairy_performance_assessment_Measuring_computational_thinking_in_middle_school","220049873_Enhancing_the_Automatic_Generation_of_Hints_with_Expert_Seeding","51969319_Scikit-learn_Machine_Learning_in_Python","322715582_The_elements_of_statistical_learning","299799415_Towards_data-driven_mastery_learning","252032972_Using_Latent_Semantic_Analysis_for_automated_grading_programming_assignments","247866270_The_elements_of_statistical_learning_data_mining_inference_and_prediciton","245628060_Patterns_and_Software_Essential_Concepts_and_Terminology","243785828_Alice_Rapid_Prototyping_System_for_Virtual_Reality","242358078_The_Elements_Of_Statistical_Learning","228328446_A_Survey_of_Automated_Assessment_Approaches_for_Programming_Assignments","222656972_Assessing_creative_problem-solving_with_automated_text_grading"]}
