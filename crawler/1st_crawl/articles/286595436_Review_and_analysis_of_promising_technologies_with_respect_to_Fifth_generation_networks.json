{"id":"286595436_Review_and_analysis_of_promising_technologies_with_respect_to_Fifth_generation_networks","abstract":"In INDIA, fourth generation mobile networks were already deployed in defined locations. In many developed countries, 4G is playing a prominent role. Even though 4G networks generates excellent data rates (more than 500mbps), there are few challenges still to be addressed. The major problems include optimum allocation of spectrum and huge consumption of energy. The emerging wireless applications were opened doors for researchers to research on possible high data rates. In this article, the promising technologies were proposed which are more useful in 5G technology. Analysis has been given to understand the design constraints ofproposed 5G technology","authors":["Seetaiah Kilaru","Harikishore K","Sravani T","Anvesh Chowdary L"],"meta":["August 2014","DOI:10.1109/CNSC.2014.6906653","Conference: 2014 International Conference on Networks & Soft Computing (ICNSC)"],"references":["262567786_Spatial_Modulation_for_Generalized_MIMO_Challenges_Opportunities_and_Implementation","228453465_Spectral_Efficiency_Analysis_of_Mobile_Femtocell_Based_Cellular_Systems","224145593_Capacity_of_Hybrid_Cognitive_Radio_Networks_With_Distributed_VAAs","220144649_Green_Radio_Radio_Techniques_to_Enable_Energy-Efficient_Wireless_Networks","51989664_Scaling_up_MIMO_Opportunities_and_Challenges_with_Very_Large_Arrays","3200441_Femtocell_networks_a_survey_IEEE_Commun_Mag","289586572_Recent_advances_and_future_challenges_for_massive_MIMO_channel_measurements_and_models","226943422_A_Hybrid_Adaptive_Wireless_Channel_Access_Protocol_for_Multimedia_Personal_Communication_Systems","224468862_Secondary_spectrum_access_networks","3427734_Roadmap_of_IMT-advanced_development"]}
