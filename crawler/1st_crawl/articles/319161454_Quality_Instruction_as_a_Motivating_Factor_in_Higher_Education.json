{"id":"319161454_Quality_Instruction_as_a_Motivating_Factor_in_Higher_Education","abstract":"The importance of quality instruction in motivating students in higher education cannot be overemphasized. Without quality instruction, students’ motivation to learn recedes. Five focus groups of graduate students aided the data collection for this study. More than one-third of the 119 participating graduate students involved in this study claimed that quality of instruction was the raison d’être for their motivation in higher education. The implications of quality instruction for practice (i.e., andragogical competency, adequate preparation and organization, content and currency of knowledge, technological competency, resourcefulness, and dispositional attributes), institutional policy, and further research are also discussed.","authors":["Olusegun Sogunro"],"meta":["August 2017International Journal of Higher Education 6(4):173","DOI:10.5430/ijhe.v6n4p173"],"references":["248963109_Academic_Research_and_Teaching_Quality_The_Views_of_Undergraduate_and_Postgraduate_Students","228598653_The_Relationship_Between_Teaching_and_Research_Where_Does_Geography_Stand_and_Deliver","316753512_Perceived_control_in_college_students_Implications_for_instruction_in_higher_education","313403758_Faculty_development_and_student_learning_Assessing_the_connections","304377436_Emotional_Intelligence_Why_It_Can_Matter_More_Than_IQ","293506107_Investigating_your_own_teaching","285651933_Comparing_the_Effectiveness_of_Classroom_and_Online_Learning_Teaching_Research_Methods","280896957_Motivating_Factors_for_Adult_Learners_in_Higher_Education","275670712_Higher_education_teachers'_professional_learning_Process_and_outcome","274583128_Understanding_and_Facilitating_Adult_Learning","274274749_Making_Sense_of_Adult_Learning","271429461_Educational_Research_Planning_Planning_Conducting_and_Evaluating_Quantitative_and_Qualitative_Research","271086796_Teaching_Well_and_Liking_It_Motivating_Faculty_to_Teach_Effectively","270585208_Visible_Learning_for_Teachers_Maximising_Impact_on_Learning","270371951_Enhancing_Adult_Motivation_to_Learn_A_Guide_to_Improving_Instruction_and_Increasing_Learner_Achievement","255578675_Andragogy_for_adult_learners_in_higher_education","249237851_Applied_Linguistics_in_Court","248963134_Academic_Research_and_Student_Motivation","248069271_The_Association_Between_Student_Ratings_of_Specific_Instructional_Dimensions_and_Student_Achievement","245455426_Applying_Educational_Research_A_Practical_Guide_for_Teachers","242031241_Frequency_and_Types_of_Instructor_Interactions_in_Online_Instruction","239560687_The_Modern_Practice_of_Adult_Education_From_Pedagogy_to_Andragogy","234717133_Expectations_and_Demands_in_Online_Teaching_Practical_Experiences","234587141_Working_with_Adult_Learners","233896244_Motivation_In_Education_Theory_Research_and_Applications","232530340_Introduction_to_the_Special_Section","227869758_Authenticity_and_power","227539205_Fostering_Motivation_in_Professional_Development_Programs","44838749_If_you_don't_feed_the_teachers_they_eat_the_students_a_guide_to_success_for_administrators_and_teachers","44837893_The_Adult_Learner_The_Definitive_Classic_in_Adult_Education_and_Human_Resource_Development","44837850_Learning_in_Adulthood_A_Comprehensive_Guide","22841258_Selecting_learning_strategies_a_self-instructional_manual"]}
