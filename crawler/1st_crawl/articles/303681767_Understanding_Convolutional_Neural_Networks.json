{"id":"303681767_Understanding_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","abstract":"Convoulutional Neural Networks (CNNs) exhibit extraordinary performance on a variety of machine learning tasks. However, their mathematical properties and behavior are quite poorly understood. There is some work, in the form of a framework, for analyzing the operations that they perform. The goal of this project is to present key results from this theory, and provide intuition for why CNNs work.","authors":["Jayanth Koushik"],"meta":["May 2016"],"references":["281599259_Scattering_Representations_for_Recognition","277411157_Deep_Learning","240308778_Invariant_Scattering_Convolution_Networks","236326062_Deep_Scattering_Spectrum","2985446_Gradient-Based_Learning_Applied_to_Document_Recognition","312538118_Support-vector_networks","291437554_Understanding_Deep_Convolutional_Networks","278710148_A_Friendly_Guide_to_Wavelets","220343922_Support_Vector_Network","48185373_Group_Invariant_Scattering","2439558_Handwritten_Digit_Recognition_with_a_Back-Propagation_Network"]}
