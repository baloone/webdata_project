AI-assisted cystoscopy may improve image recognition and accelerate data acquisition.\n\nObjective\nTo provide a comprehensive review of machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL) and convolutional neural network (CNN) applications in cystoscopic image recognition.\n\nEvidence acquisition\nA detailed search of original articles was performed using the PubMed-MEDLINE database to identify recent English literature relevant to ML, DL and CNN applications in cystoscopic image recognition.\n\nEvidence synthesis\nIn total, two articles and one conference abstract were identified addressing the application of AI methods in cystoscopic image recognition. These investigations showed accuracies exceeding 90% for tumor detection; however, future work is necessary to incorporate these methods into AI-aided cystoscopy and compared to other tumor visualization tools. Furthermore, we present results from the RaVeNNA-4pi consortium initiative which has extracted 4200 frames from 62 videos, analyzed them with the U-Net network and achieved an average dice score of 0.67. Improvements in its precision can be achieved by augmenting the video/frame database.\n\nConclusion\nAI-aided cystoscopy has the potential to outperform urologists at recognizing and classifying bladder lesions. To ensure their real-life implementation, however, these algorithms require external validation to generalize their results across other data sets.","authors":["Misgana Negassi","Rodrigo Suarez-Ibarrola","Simon Hein","Arkadiusz Miernik"],"meta":["October 2020World Journal of Urology 38(1)","DOI:10.1007/s00345-019-03059-0"],"references":["337851555_Systematic_meta-analyses_field_synopsis_and_global_assessment_of_the_evidence_of_genetic_association_studies_in_colorectal_cancer","331657057_Randomised_controlled_trial_of_WISENSE_a_real-time_quality_improving_system_for_monitoring_blind_spots_during_esophagogastroduodenoscopy","331391835_Real-time_automatic_detection_system_increases_colonoscopic_polyp_and_adenoma_detection_rates_A_prospective_randomised_controlled_study","338026049_Meta-analysis_of_the_efficacy_and_safety_of_PD-1PD-L1_inhibitors_administered_alone_or_in_combination_with_anti-VEGF_agents_in_advanced_hepatocellular_carcinoma","334427695_Mask-RCNN_and_U-Net_Ensembled_for_Nuclei_Segmentation","334271149_Artificial_intelligence_-_upping_the_game_in_gastrointestinal_endoscopy","332617231_LBA-20_AUTOMATED_CYSTOSCOPIC_DETECTION_OF_BLADDER_CANCER_USING_DEEP-LEARNING","331725093_2D_and_3D_bladder_segmentation_using_U-Net-based_deep-learning","331402178_Transurethral_resection_of_bladder_tumours_established_and_new_methods_of_tumour_visualisation","330906198_Abstract_nnU-Net_Self-adapting_Framework_for_U-Net-Based_Medical_Image_Segmentation"]}
