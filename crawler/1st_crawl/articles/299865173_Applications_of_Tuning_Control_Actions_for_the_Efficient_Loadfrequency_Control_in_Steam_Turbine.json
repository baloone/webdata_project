{"id":"299865173_Applications_of_Tuning_Control_Actions_for_the_Efficient_Loadfrequency_Control_in_Steam_Turbine","abstract":"In this paper we will design as well as carry out the whole model of steam turbine by using the equivalent transfer function and see the output for uncontrolled case. We will discuss the output and apply more control on this model by using Proportional controller, Integral controller, Proportional plus Integral controller, Proportional plus Derivative controller, Proportional plus Integral plus Derivative controller. We will see and analysis these entire previous controller where it's effect in both cases transient response and steady state response. The tuning of control actions will be done by using Ziegler Nichols method and we have applied it in Simulink in Matlab.","authors":["Ali Thaeer Hammid"],"meta":["November 2013"],"references":["267806833_PID_Versus_Fuzzy_Logic_Based_Intelligent_Controller_Design_for_a_Non_Linear_Satellite's_Attitude_Control_Performance_Analysis_using_MATLABSimulink","258493779_Comparative_Analysis_of_Conventional_P_PI_PID_and_Fuzzy_Logic_Controllers_for_the_Efficient_Control_of_Concentration_in_CSTR","3115244_Modern_Power_System_Analysis"]}
