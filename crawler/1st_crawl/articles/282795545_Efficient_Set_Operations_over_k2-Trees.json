{"id":"282795545_Efficient_Set_Operations_over_k2-Trees","abstract":"k2-trees have been proved successful to represent in avery compact way different kinds of binary relations, such as web graphs, RDFs or raster data. In order to be a fully functional succinct representation for these domains, the k2-tree must support all the required operations for binary relations. In their original description, the authors include how to answer some of the most relevant queries over the k2-tree. In this paper, we extend this functionality and detail the algorithms to efficiently compute the k2-tree resulting from the union, intersection, difference or complement of binary relations represented using k2-trees.","authors":["Nieves R.
