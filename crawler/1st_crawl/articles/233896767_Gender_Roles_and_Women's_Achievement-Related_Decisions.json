{"id":"233896767_Gender_Roles_and_Women's_Achievement-Related_Decisions","abstract":"Occupational sex segregation continues to exist and the occupational career paths of women and men continue to differ. This article proposes a model to explain these persistent, gender-role linked trends, summarizes evidence to support the proposed mediating psychological mechanisms, and discusses the social experiences that shape gender differences on these mediators. In addition, the article reviews the economic and psychological costs often associated with the traditional female choices and proposes interventions aimed at achieving a more genderâ€”fair social system that does not devalue traditionally female domains. The proposed model links occupational choices to expectations for success and subjective task value, which, in turn, are linked to gender-role socialization, self schemas, and anticipated role and task demands. The importance of subjective task value is stressed, as is the need to study women's achievement-related choices from the women's perspective.","authors":["Jacquelynne S Eccles"],"meta":["June 1987Psychology of Women Quarterly 11(2):135-172","DOI:10.1111/j.1471-6402.1987.tb00781.x"],"references":["265276449_Women's_Work_Men's_Work_Sex_Segregation_on_the_Job","232528995_Impact_of_work_on_women_at_midlife","232527415_Sex_Differences_in_Achievement_A_Test_of_Alternate_Theories","232521536_Sex_differences_in_the_evaluation_and_performance_of_dominant_acts","232495935_Sex_Differences_in_Math_Achievement_Toward_a_Model_of_Academic_Choice","232490806_The_relationship_of_career-related_self-efficacy_expectation_to_perceived_career_options_in_college_women_and_men","343496188_Hard_Choices_How_Women_Decide_About_Work_Career_and_Motherhood","317953663_Self-Efficacy_Toward_a_Unifying_Theory_of_Behavioral_Change","303240889_Gender_Differences_in_Math_Ability_The_Impact_of_Media_Reports_on_Parents","287497438_Academic_scholarship_and_its_rewards","272594027_Increasing_Women's_Participation_in_Mathematics_An_Intervention_Study","271782124_Sex-Differentiated_Patterns_of_Intergenerational_Occupational_Mobility","269753429_The_Inner_American_A_Self-Portrait_from_1957_to_1976","249690311_Sex_Differences_in_the_Choice_of_a_Male_or_Female_Career_Line_An_Analysis_of_Background_Characteristics_and_Work_Values","247763964_Career_Preferences_of_Early_Adolescents_Age_and_Sex_Differences","247638831_Children's_Performance_in_a_Game_and_Their_Attraction_to_It_as_a_Function_of_Sex-Typed_Labels","247516808_Young_People's_Perceptions_of_their_Occupational_Decision-Making","247335048_The_relationship_of_self_and_occupational_concepts_to_the_occupational_preferences_of_adolescents","246751400_Making_vocational_choices_A_theory_of_vocational_personalities_and_work_environments","242631159_Comparable_worth_How_do_we_know_it_will_work","241278362_The_Nature_of_Human_Values","240801790_Effective_Teaching_Student_Engagement_in_Classroom_Activities_and_Sex-Related_Differences_in_Learning_Mathematics","234686109_Certified_But_Not_Hired_Women_Administrators_in_Pennsylvania","233897063_Race_and_sex_differences_in_college_science_program_participation","233896996_Achievement_Motivation_and_Values_An_Alternative_Perspective","233896950_Socialization_of_Achievement_Attitudes_and_Beliefs_Parental_Influences","233896905_Sex_Differences_in_Children's_Math_Achievement_Parental_Attitudes","233896904_Science_and_the_Media_Benbow_and_Stanley_Revisited","233896836_Classroom_Experiences_and_Student_Gender_Are_There_Differences_and_Do_They_Matter","233896802_Classroom_Practices_and_Motivation_to_Study_Math","233896800_Social_Forces_Shape_Math_Attitudes_and_Performance","233294672_Sex_schools_and_emerging_occupational_interests","233136153_Multidimensional_Scaling_A_Possible_Technique_for_Examining_Male_and_Female_Occupational_Perceptions_and_Preferences","232598346_Factors_influencing_the_choice_of_non-required_mathematics_courses","232587739_Genetic_studies_of_genius_Mental_and_physical_traits_of_a_thousand_gifted_children","232573340_Are_causal_attributions_causal_A_path_analysis_of_the_cognitive_model_of_achievement_motivation","232554119_Reasons_for_entering_medical_school_in_relation_to_value_priorities_and_sex_of_student","232552673_An_Introduction_to_Motivation","232529071_Motivational_Processes_Affecting_Learning","232515120_Awareness_and_Expression_of_Sex_Stereo-types_in_Young_Children","232493681_Masculinity_femininity_psychological_androgyny_and_the_structure_of_values","232477153_The_conceptual_representation_and_the_measurement_of_psychological_forces_Contributions_to_psychological_theory","232471906_Model_of_Career_and_Achievement_Motivation_for_Women_and_Men","232441441_Teacher-student_relationships_Causes_and_consequences","229225622_The_distortion_of_memory_for_careers_The_influence_of_the_thematic_organization_of_occupational_information","227938344_Cognitive-Developmental_Factors_in_Emerging_Sex_Differences_in_Achievement-Related_Expectancies","227153056_Values_expectations_and_the_prediction_of_social_action_An_expectancy-valence_analysis","226881654_The_masculinity-femininity_of_women_who_study_college_mathematics","226410459_Gender_differences_in_leisure-need_activity_pattern","226213574_A_theory_of_informal_barriers_for_women_in_mathematics","22997356_Females_and_Illness_Recent_Trends_in_Sex_Differences_in_the_United_States","43118849_Contextual_Determinants_of_Personality","37712274_In_a_Different_Voice","22308002_Self-Efficacy_-_Toward_A_Unifying_Theory_of_Behavioral_Change","19074933_Sex_Differences_in_the_Relationship_Between_Work_and_Health_The_Minnesota_Heart_Survey"]}
