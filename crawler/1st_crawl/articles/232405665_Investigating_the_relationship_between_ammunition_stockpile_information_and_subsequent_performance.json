{"id":"232405665_Investigating_the_relationship_between_ammunition_stockpile_information_and_subsequent_performance","abstract":"Ammunition plays an important role in national defense and military strength. However, it is typically produced long before its ultimate consumption, and its reliability can change throughout the stockpile period. This study used the second method of quantification based on a canonical correlation analysis in order to understand the relationship between ammunition stockpile information and a set of performance tests investigating velocity, accuracy, and the number of fuse failures. Our empirical finding is as follows: the ammunitions which are manufactured in spring/summer or stored for 15–19/23–26 years, have fewer instances of fuse failure, but have a higher degree of failures involving velocity and accuracy than the ammunitions which are manufactured in autumn/winter or stored for 20–22 years. Our analysis facilitates a nonlinear relationship between these parameters, and is expected to give useful feedback information.","authors":["Chan Sik Jung","So Young Sohn"],"meta":["April 2010Reliability Engineering [?] System Safety 95(4):426-430","DOI:10.1016/j.ress.2009.11.013"],"references":["265332198_On_the_Quantification_of_Qualitative_Data_from_the_Mathematico-Statistical_Point_of_View","254332949_Estimation_of_Reliability_in_Field_-_Performance_Studies","245079368_A_comparison_of_risk_estimation_methods_for_binary_systems","245078898_Shelflife_estimation_of_gun_propellant_stockpile","243772109_The_Quanti_cation_of_a_Class_of_Attributes_A_Theory_and_Method_of_Scale_Construction","238866566_A_Monte_Carlo_Study_of_Variable_Selection_and_Inferences_in_a_Two_Stage_Random_Coefficient_Linear_Regression_Model_With_Unbalanced_Data","235040593_Prediction_of_Safe_Life_of_Propellants","226679704_Multidimensional_quantification_I","226465731_On_the_prediction_of_phenomena_from_mathematicostatistical_point_of_view","221932975_Statistical_Methods_For_Research_Workers","22600874_Review_of_the_Methods_of_Quantification","3151289_Optimum_Simple_Step-Stress_Accelerated_Life_Tests_with_Censoring"]}
