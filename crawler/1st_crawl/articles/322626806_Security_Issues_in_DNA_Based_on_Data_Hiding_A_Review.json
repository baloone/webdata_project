{"id":"322626806_Security_Issues_in_DNA_Based_on_Data_Hiding_A_Review","abstract":"Information security and confidentiality are a key concern, particularly with the rampant growth and use of the internet. Along with the growth comes the incidents of unauthorized information access which are countered by the use of varied secure communication techniques, namely; cryptography and data hiding. More recent trends are concerned with the application of DNA cryptography and data hiding by using it as a carrier thereby making use of its bio-molecular computational properties. This paper provides a survey of recently published DNA based data hiding algorithms which make use of DNA to safeguard critical data being transmitted over an insecure communication channel. Several DNA-based data hiding techniques will be discussed with particular emphasis on strength and weaknesses of the algorithm in question; algorithms are compared based on the cracking probability, double layer of security, single or double hiding layer, blindness, and much more. This will be useful for future research in the design of more efficient and reliable of secure DNA data hiding techniques.","authors":["Dilovan Zebari","Habibollah Haron","Subhi R. M.
