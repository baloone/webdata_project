{"id":"33421583_On_the_behavior_of_the_Sierpinski_multiband_antenna","abstract":"The multiband behavior of the fractal Sierpinski antenna is described. Due to its mainly triangular shape, the antenna is compared to the well-known single-band bow-tie antenna. Both experimental and numerical results show that the self-similarity properties of the fractal shape are translated into its electromagnetic behavior. A deeper physical insight on such a behavior is achieved by means of the computed current densities over the antenna surface, which also display some similarity properties through the bands.
