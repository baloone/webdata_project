{"id":"222485510_Hierarchy_theorems_for_kOBDDs_and_kIBDDs","abstract":"Almost the same types of restricted branching programs (or binary decision diagrams BDDs) are considered in complexity theory and in applications like hardware verification. These models are read-once branching programs (free BDDs) and certain types of oblivious branching programs (ordered and indexed BDDs with k layers). The complexity of the satisfiability problem for these restricted branching programs is investigated and tight hierarchy results are proved for the classes of functions representable by k layers of ordered or indexed BDDs of polynomial size.","authors":["Beate Bollig","Martin Sauerhoff","Detlef Sieling","Ingo Wegener"],"meta":["September 1998Theoretical Computer Science 205(1-2):45-60","DOI:10.1016/S0304-3975(97)00034-0"],"references":["227312051_Some_bounds_on_multiparty_communication_complexity_of_pointer_jumping","227300730_Simultaneous_messages_vs_communication","226130270_On_lower_bounds_for_read-k-times_branching_programs","221591767_Lower_Bounds_on_Communication_Complexity","220994728_Some_Bounds_on_Multiparty_Communication_Complexity_of_Pointer_Jumping","220617330_Rounds_in_Communication_Complexity_Revisited","3048809_Bryant_RE_Graph-Based_Algorithms_for_Boolean_Function_Manipulation_IEEE_Trans_Computers_358_677-691","285354142_An_Exponential_Lower_Bound_for_One-Time-Only_Branching_Programs","280765005_Graph-based_algorithms_for_Boolean_function_manipulation","266294676_On_lower_bounds_for_branching_programs","248237635_Untere_Schranken_flouur_Berechnungen_durch_Verzweigungsprogramme","243787919_Symbolic_boolean_operation_with_ordered_binary_decision_diagrams","240101155_Lower_bounds_for_branching_programs_computing_characteristic_functions_of_binary_codes","228057650_Multiparty_Protocols_Pseudorandom_Generators_for_Logspace_and_Time-Space_Trade-offs","225788159_The_conjunctive_complexity_of_quadratic_Boolean_functions","223869619_Lower_bounds_on_communication_complexity","222917398_Results_on_Communication_Complexity_Classes","221591039_Multi-Party_Protocols","221590157_Rounds_in_Communication_Complexity_Revisited","221580752_Results_on_Communication_Complexity_Classes","221349827_The_Complexity_of_Symmetric_Boolean_Functions","220995205_Simultaneous_Messages_vs_Communication","220976508_An_Exponential_Lower_Bound_for_One-Time-Only_Branching_Programs","220917103_On_the_Complexity_of_Branching_Programs_and_Decision_Trees_for_Clique_Functions","220752650_New_Lower_Bounds_and_Hierarchy_Results_for_Restricted_Branching_Programs","220617093_Different_Modes_of_Communication","220574442_New_Lower_Bounds_and_Hierarchy_Results_for_Restricted_Branching_Programs","220431237_On_the_complexity_of_branching_programs_and_decision_trees_for_clique_functions","220248257_On_Oblivious_Branching_Programs_of_Linear_Length","220246177_Lower_Bounds_for_Depth-Restricted_Branching_Programs","4355095_Meanders_Ramsey_theory_and_lower_bounds_for_branching_programs","3559296_Efficient_algorithmic_circuit_verification_using_indexed_BDDs","3511097_IBDDs_An_efficient_functional_representation_for_digital_circuits"]}
