{"id":"313956570_Robotic_implementation_of_classical_and_operant_conditioning_within_a_single_SNN_architecture","abstract":"This work presents the implementation of operant conditioning (OC) and classical conditioning (CC) with a single spiking neural network (SNN) architecture, thus suggesting that the two types of leaning may relate to the same cognitive process. Both are achieved by using a modified version of spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), where the connection weight between a cue neuron and an action neuron depends on the temporal relation between their spikes and those of a reward neuron. This reward driven STDP (RD-STDP) was implemented with simple computational resources to form an electronic robot's brain, using an adaptation of the synapto-dendritic kernel adapting neuron (SKAN) model. Then, a robot driven by the new neuronal architecture was tested in a maze with changing features, successfully exhibiting CC and OC. These results and the simple computational resources used make the proposed architecture promising for very large scale time-dependent parallel data analysis, with high capacity of adaptation in a dynamic environment. Moreover, it proposes a theoretic framework to model learning by conditioning.","authors":["Etienne Dumesnil","Philippe-Olivier Beaulieu","Mounir Boukadoum"],"meta":["August 2016","DOI:10.1109/ICCI-CC.2016.7862055","Conference: 2016 IEEE 15th International Conference on Cognitive Informatics & Cognitive Computing (ICCI*CC)","Project: Classical ans operant conditioning"],"references":["264793385_Operant_Conditioning_A_Minimal_Components_Requirement_in_Artificial_Spiking_Neurons_Designed_for_Bio-Inspired_Robot's_Controller","264558764_Racing_to_Learn_Statistical_Inference_and_Learning_in_a_Single_Spiking_Neuron","5577361_Spike_Timing-Dependent_Plasticity_A_Hebbian_Learning_Rule","309776006_Robotic_implementation_of_classical_and_Operant_Conditioning_as_a_single_STDP_learning_process","309613369_FPGA_minimal_components_SKAN_model_for_classical_and_operant_conditioning","240321346_The_organisation_of_behavior_A_neuropsychological_approach","232561923_The_behavior_of_organisms_An_experimental_analysis","221936221_Artificial_Intelligence_A_Modern_Approach","200044349_Artificial_Intelligence_A_Modern_Approach","200033858_Spiking_Neuron_Models_Single_Neurons_Populations_Plasticity"]}
