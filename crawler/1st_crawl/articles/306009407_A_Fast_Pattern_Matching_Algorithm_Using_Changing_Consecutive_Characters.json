{"id":"306009407_A_Fast_Pattern_Matching_Algorithm_Using_Changing_Consecutive_Characters","abstract":"Pattern matching is a very important algorithm used in many applications such as search engine \nand DNA analysis. They are aiming to find a pattern in a text. This paper proposes a Pattern \nMatching Algorithm Using Changing Consecutive Characters (PMCCC) to make the searching pro-\ncess of the algorithm faster. PMCCC enhances the shift process that determines how the pattern \nmoves in case of the occurrence of the mismatch between the pattern and the text. It enhances the \nBerry Ravindran (BR) shift function by using m consecutive characters where m is the pattern \nlength. The formal basis and the algorithms are presented. The experimental results show that \nPMCCC made enhancements in searching process by reducing the number of comparisons and the \nnumber of attempts. Comparing the results of PMCCC with other related algorithms has shown \nsignificant enhancements in average number of comparisons and average number of attempts","authors":["Amjad Hudaib","Dima Suleiman","Arafat Awajan"],"meta":["January 2016Journal of Software Engineering and Applications 09(08):399-411","DOI:10.4236/jsea.2016.98026","Project: Algorithms"],"references":["305391146_RS-A_Fast_Pattern_Matching_Algorithm_for_Biological_Sequences","289776001_Enhanced_Berry_Ravindran_pattern_matching_algorithm_EBR","282652139_Study_of_Different_Algorithms_for_Pattern_Matching","273769855_Four_Sliding_Windows_Pattern_Matching_Algorithm_FSW","273769760_Enhancing_ERS-A_Algorithm_for_Pattern_Matching_EERS-A","273769638_Enhancing_ERS-A_Algorithm_for_Pattern_Matching_EERS-A","313314864_A_fast_string_matching_algorithm_and_experimental_results","312416666_A_Fast_Hybrid_Algorithm_for_the_Exact_String_Matching_Problem","289907659_An_index_based_forward_backward_multiple_pattern_matching_algorithm","273338978_Improved-Bidirectional_Exact_Pattern_Matching"]}
