{"id":"220566331_Techniques_for_Automatically_Correcting_Words_in_Text","abstract":"Research aimed at correcting words in text has focused on three progressively more difficult problems:(1) nonword error detection; (2) isolated-word error correction; and (3) context-dependent work correction. In response to the first problem, efficient pattern-matching and n-gram analysis techniques have been developed for detecting strings that do not appear in a given word list. In response to the second problem, a variety of general and application-specific spelling correction techniques have been developed. Some of them were based on detailed studies of spelling error patterns. In response to the third problem, a few experiments using natural-language-processing tools or statistical-language models have been carried out. This article surveys documented findings on spelling error patterns, provides descriptions of various nonword detection and isolated-word error correction techniques, reviews the state of the art of context-dependent word correction techniques, and discusses research issues related to all three areas of automatic error correction in text.","authors":["Karen Kukich"],"meta":["December 1992ACM Computing Surveys 24(4):377-439","DOI:10.1145/146370.146380","SourceDBLP"],"references":["301144179_Estimation_Procedures_for_Language_Context_Poor_Estimates_are_Worse_than_None","268486124_Triphone_analysis","267385488_A_Language-Sensitive_Text_Editor_for_Dutch","239665720_Morphology_and_rhyming_two_powerful_alternatives_to_letter-to-sound_rules_for_speech_synthesis","234828877_Enhanced_Good-Turing_and_Cat-Cal_two_new_methods_for_estimating_probabilities_of_English_bigrams","234580996_Slips_of_the_Pen","224377724_A_Maximum_Likelihood_Approach_to_Continuous_Speech_Recognition","303517845_A_tree-based_statistical_language_model_for_natural_language_speech_recognition","266543243_Analysis_of_word_similarity_in_spelling_correction_systems","266519834_Content-Addressable_Memories","262221905_Automatic_spelling_correction_in_scientific_and_scholar_text","255681866_Cn_yur_cmputr_raed_ths","250900022_How_Fully_Does_a_Machine-Usable_Dictionary_Cover_English_Text","249379755_Computer_help_for_poor_spellers","248601167_Landauer_Indexing_by_Latent_Semantic_Analysis","246141246_Experiments_with_a_connectionist_text_reader","245578990_Back-propagation_networks_for_spelling_correction","245314747_An_e_ective_algorithm_for_string_correction_using_generalized_edit_distances-i","245213873_Conventional_and_associative_memory_approaches_to_automatic_spelling_correction","243636811_Computer_Text_Recognition_and_Error_Correction","242802991_A_bottom-up_and_top-down_approach_to_using_context_in_text_recognition","242637483_Parsnip_a_connectionist_network_that_learns_natural_language_grammar_from_exposure_to_natural_language_sentences","242524707_Computer_detection_of_typographical_errors","242439023_The_use_of_machine-readable_dictionaries_in_sublanguage_analysis","242374619_Integrating_multiple_knowledge_sources_in_a_Bayesian_OCR_post-processor","242107116_Spelling_Correction_in_Systems_Programs","240482433_Design_of_a_parallel_knowledge_-_based_optical_character_recognition_system","240481979_An_intelligent_spelling_corrector","238984455_A_Practical_Approach_for_Representing_Context_and_for_Performing_Word_Sense_Disambiguation_Using_Neural_Networks","238247068_Information_retrieval_using_self-organizing_neural_networks","237224496_An_Interactive_Activation_Model_of_Context_Effects_in_Letter_Perception_Part_2_The_Contextual_Enhancement_Effect_and_Some_Tests_and_Extensions_of_the_Model","234829414_Technical_corrections_On_Spelling_Correction_and_Beyond","234813814_A_Hash_Code_Method_for_Detecting_and_Correcting_Spelling_Errors","234803698_Meta-rules_as_a_basis_for_processing_ill-formed_input","234785829_Programming_pearls_a_spelling_checker","233823597_Trie_Memory","232570072_A_collection_of_computer-readable_corpora_of_English_spelling_errors","232128580_On_the_Population_Frequency_of_Species_and_the_Estimation_of_Population_Parameters","230876183_Spelling_correction_using_probabilistic_methods","230876088_Error_Patterns_in_Novice_and_Skilled_Transcription_Typing","230875928_A_Stochastic_Parts_Program_and_Noun_Phrase_Parser_for_Unrestricted_Text","230875859_Pattern_Recognition_and_Reading_by_Machine","229649377_Collection_and_characterization_spelling_errors_in_scientific_and_scholarly_text","228057706_Indexing_By_Latent_Semantic_Analysis","227078461_Probability_scoring_for_spelling_correction","226723463_Computerized_correction_of_phonographic_errors","224740126_Performance_of_back_propagation_networks_for_associative_database_retrieval","224483305_A_Method_for_the_Correction_of_Garbled_Words_Based_on_the_Levenshtein_Metric","224378017_On_the_Recognition_of_Printed_Characters_of_Any_Font_and_Size","224377761_Designing_a_Handwriting_Reader","224377683_Experiments_in_Text_Recognition_with_Binary_n-Gram_and_Viterbi_Algorithms","224377465_Experiments_in_Text_Recognition_with_the_Modified_Viterbi_Algorithm","224102425_The_EPISTLE_text-critiquing_system","223668179_Structural_differences_between_common_and_rare_words_Failure_of_equivalence_assumptions_for_theories_of_word_recognition","223664142_The_use_of_trigram_analysis_for_spelling_error_detection"]}
