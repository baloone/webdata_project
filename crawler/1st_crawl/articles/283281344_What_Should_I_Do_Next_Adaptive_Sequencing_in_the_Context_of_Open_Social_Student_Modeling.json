{"id":"283281344_What_Should_I_Do_Next_Adaptive_Sequencing_in_the_Context_of_Open_Social_Student_Modeling","abstract":"One of the original goals of intelligent educational systems\nwas to guide each student to the most appropriate educational content. In\nprevious studies, we explored both knowledge-based and social guidance\napproaches and learned that each has a weak side. In the present work,\nwe have explored the idea of combining social guidance with more traditional knowledge-based guidance systems in hopes of supporting more optimal content navigation. We propose a greedy sequencing approach aimed at maximizing each student’s level of knowledge and implemented it in the context of an open social student modeling interface. We performed a classroom study to examine the impact of this combined guidance approach. The results of our classroom study show that a greedy\nguidance approach positively affected students’ navigation, increased the\nspeed of learning for strong students, and improved the overall performance of students, both within the system and through end-of-course assessments.","authors":["Roya Hosseini","I-Han Hsiao","Julio Guerra","Peter Brusilovsky"],"meta":["January 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-24258-3_12"],"references":["280113640_Adaptive_Navigation_Support","269226394_Mastery_grids_An_open-source_social_educational_progress_visualization","266656951_Mastery_Grids_An_Open_Source_Social_Educational_Progress_Visualization","259781741_Progressor_Social_navigation_support_through_open_social_student_modeling","259781445_JavaParser_A_Fine-Grain_Concept_Indexing_Tool_for_Java_Problems","229674759_Guiding_students_to_the_right_questions_Adaptive_navigation_support_in_an_E-Learning_system_for_Java_programming","228788763_Group_Interaction_Prompted_by_a_Simple_Assessed_Open_Learner_Model_that_can_be_Optionally_Released_to_Peers","280113639_Hybrid_Web_Recommender_Systems","262317857_Student_Models_that_Invite_the_Learner_In_The_SMILI_Open_Learner_Modelling_Framework","227613096_Dynamic_Courseware_Generation_on_the_WWW"]}
