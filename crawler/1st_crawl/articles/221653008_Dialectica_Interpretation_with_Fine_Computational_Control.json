{"id":"221653008_Dialectica_Interpretation_with_Fine_Computational_Control","abstract":"Computational proof interpretations enrich the logical mean- ing of formula connectives and quantiers with algorithmic relevance and allow to extract the construction contained in a proof. Berger showed that quantiers can be selectively declared irrelevant for the modied re- alisability interpretation, thus removing unnecessary computation from the extracted program (1). Hernest adapted the uniform quantiers to Godel's Dialectica interpretation (2) and later demonstrated together with the author how they can be rened (5). The present paper gives a further extension, in which the computational meaning can be controlled separately for every component of the Dialectica interpretation. Apart from enriching the possibilities to remove redundancies in extracted pro- grams, this ner approach also allows to independently switch o the postive or negative algorithmic contribution of whole formulas.","authors":["Trifon Anchev Trifonov"],"meta":["July 2009","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-03073-4_48","SourceDBLP","Conference: Mathematical Theory and Computational Practice, 5th Conference on Computability in Europe, CiE 2009, Heidelberg, Germany, July 19-24, 2009.
