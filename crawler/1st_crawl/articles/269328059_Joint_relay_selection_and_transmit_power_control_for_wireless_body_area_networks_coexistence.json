{"id":"269328059_Joint_relay_selection_and_transmit_power_control_for_wireless_body_area_networks_coexistence","abstract":"A scheme for two-hop relay-assisted cooperative communications integrated with transmit power control, based on simple channel prediction, is presented. A large set of empirical on- and inter-body channel data is employed to model various scenarios of wireless body area network (WBAN) communications, from one isolated WBAN up to 10 closely located WBANs coexisting. Our study shows that relay assisted power control can reduce approximately 60% circuit power consumption from that of constant transmission at 0 dBm, without much loss in reliability. Further, interference mitigation is significantly enhanced over constant transmission at -5 dBm, with similar power consumption. Such performance is maintained from 2 to 10 closely-located WBANs coexisting. And the joint algorithm works best for one isolated WBAN. A trade-off between power saving and interference mitigation is motivated, taking remaining sensor-battery level, amount of interference and on-body channel quality into account.","authors":["Jie Dong","David Smith"],"meta":["June 2014","DOI:10.1109/ICC.2014.6884226","Conference: ICC 2014 - 2014 IEEE International Conference on Communications"],"references":["233937058_Opportunistic_Relaying_in_Wireless_Body_Area_Networks_CoexistencePerformance","221170472_Simple_Prediction-Based_Power_Control_for_the_On-Body_Area_Communications_Channel","220545517_Performance_evaluation_of_direct_and_cooperative_transmissions_in_body_area_networks","261417998_Transmit_power_control_for_wireless_body_area_networks_using_novel_channel_prediction","257811762_Cooperative_receive_diversity_for_coded_GFSK_body-area_communications","254037486_Transmit_power_control_for_wireless_body_area_networks_using_novel_channel_prediction","224368621_Cooperative_Communications_in_Ultra-Wideband_Wireless_Body_Area_Networks_Channel_Modeling_and_System_Diversity_Analysis","224206027_Open-source_testbed_for_Body_Area_Networks_200_samplesec_12_hrs_continuous_measurement","224154703_Performance_of_Piconet_Co-Existence_Schemes_in_Wireless_Body_Area_Networks","221172120_A_Performance_Evaluation_of_Cooperative_Schemes_for_On-Body_Area_Networks_Based_on_Measured_Time-Variant_Channels"]}
