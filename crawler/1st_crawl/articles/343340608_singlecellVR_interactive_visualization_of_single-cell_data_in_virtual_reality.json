{"id":"343340608_singlecellVR_interactive_visualization_of_single-cell_data_in_virtual_reality","abstract":"Single-cell assays have transformed our ability to model heterogeneity within cell populations and tissues. Virtual reality has recently emerged as a powerful technology to dynamically explore complex data. However, expensive hardware or advanced data preprocessing skills are required to adapt such technology to single-cell data. To address current shortcomings, we built singlecellVR, a user-friendly website for visualizing single- cell data, designed for cheap and easily available virtual reality hardware (e.g., Google Cardboard, ~$8). We provide a companion package, scvr to streamline data conversion from the most widely-adopted single-cell analysis tools and a database of pre-analyzed datasets to which users can contribute.","authors":["David F Stein","Huidong Chen","Michael E Vinyard","Luca Pinello"],"meta":["July 2020","DOI:10.1101/2020.07.30.229534"],"references":["337332317_Assessment_of_computational_methods_for_the_analysis_of_single-cell_ATAC-seq_data","333409123_Benchmarking_single_cell_RNA-sequencing_analysis_pipelines_using_mixture_control_experiments","319188884_A_practical_guide_to_single-cell_RNA-sequencing_for_biomedical_research_and_clinical_applications","282832752_Defining_cell_types_and_states_with_single-cell_genomics","330711209_Integrative_single-cell_analysis"]}
