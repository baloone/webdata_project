{"id":"325371805_An_Experience_Report_on_Workshop_on_Emerging_Software_Engineering_Education","abstract":"The Ô¨Årst edition of the Workshop on Software Engineering Education co-located with Innovations (formerly India) in Software Engineering Conference (ISEC) was held on 9th February 2018 at IIIT Hyderabad (India). In this paper, we present an experience report on conducting this workshop. We describe the workshop format and present the workshop program. The workshop was activity-oriented consisting of talks, discussions and engagements from all the participants. We provide an overview of the four invited talks and present few highlights of these talks. We present the challenges encountered, recommendations and future plans. We describe the motivation behind the hands-on workshop activities and their respective formats. We collect a variety of data from the participants on case-based learning, wall of ideas and an activity on the debate between computer science and software engineering as two separate disciplines. We analyse this data received collected through worksheets and survey forms. We present our insights and conclusions from the data analysis. The number of attendees, participation and engagement, talks, responses to worksheets, and questionnaires demonstrate that the workshop was fruitful and successful in-terms of meeting its desired objectives.","authors":["Paramvir Singh","Sheikh Umar Farooq","Saurabh Tiwari","Ashish Sureka"],"meta":["May 2018ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes 43(2):12-23","DOI:10.1145/3203094.3203112"],"references":["324245991_Teaching_Requirements_Engineering_Concepts_using_Case-Based_Learning","323096110_A_Case_Study_on_the_Application_of_Case-Based_Learning_in_Software_Testing","316114268_Teaching_Agile_Methods_to_Software_Engineering_Professionals_10_Years_1000_Release_Plans","316075237_TECH_STARTUPS_REALISTIC_SOFTWARE_ENGINEERING_PROJECTS_WITH_INTERDISCIPLINARY_COLLABORATION","326452700_Teaching_requirements_engineering_concepts_using_case-based_learning","320671546_1st_QuASD_Workshop_Managing_Quality_in_Agile_and_Rapid_Software_Development_Processes","319633230_SEABED_An_Open-Source_Software_Engineering_Case-Based_Learning_Database","312732567_Responses_of_Female_and_Male_Medical_Students_to_Case-Based_Learning_Programme_in_Anatomy","312484621_An_Experience_Report_on_Teaching_Compiler_Design_Concepts_Using_Case-Based_and_Project-Based_Learning_Approaches","310436992_A_Nine_Year_Story_of_the_India_Software_Engineering_Conference_from_2008_to_2016","274264175_Case-Based_Learning_What_Traditional_Curricula_Fail_to_Teach","294860433_Conclusions_of_the_6th_European_American_Workshop_on_reliability_of_NDE","275644545_A_Report_on_Software_Engineering_Education_Workshop_SEED_colocated_with_ISEC_2015","262216224_Interactive_Case_Based_Learning_in_Teaching_Decision_Support_Systems_and_Business_Intelligence","262211841_Real-world_testing_Using_FOSS_for_software_development_courses"]}
