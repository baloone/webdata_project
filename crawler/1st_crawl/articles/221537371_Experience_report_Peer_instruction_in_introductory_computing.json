{"id":"221537371_Experience_report_Peer_instruction_in_introductory_computing","abstract":"Peer Instruction (PI) is a pedagogical technique to increase engagement in lectures. Students answer a multiple choice question (MCQ) typically using clickers (hand-held remote devices with a minimum of 5 option buttons), discuss the question with their peers, and then answer the question again. In physics, PI has years of evidence of increased conceptual learning, as measured by the Force Concept Inventory (FCI)[7]. In this experience report, we describe how PI was applied in CS1 and CS1.5 courses teaching Java. We identify specifics of the standard PI model which were adopted, adapted, or discarded for use in introductory computing, describe the process involved for the instructor, give examples of the types of questions asked of students, report on students' performance in answering these questions, reflect on the value for the instructor, and report the attitudes and opinions of the students. We conclude with observations, advice and suggested improvements.","authors":["Beth Simon","Michael Kohanfars","Jeff Lee","Karen Tamayo"],"meta":["January 2010","DOI:10.1145/1734263.1734381","SourceDBLP","Conference: Proceedings of the 41st ACM technical symposium on Computer science education, SIGCSE 2010, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA, March 10-13, 2010"],"references":["228806322_Using_an_electronic_voting_system_to_promote_active_reflection_on_coursework_feedback","220807373_Further_evidence_of_a_relationship_between_explaining_tracing_and_writing_skills_in_introductory_programming","216743208_Force_Concept_Inventory","23716395_Why_Peer_Discussion_Improves_Student_Performance_on_In-Class_Concept_Questions","2173657_Designing_Effective_Questions_for_Classroom_Response_System_Teaching","234801549_An_experiment_with_online_instruction_and_active_learning_in_an_introductory_computing_course_for_engineers_JiTT_meets_CS1","230189990_Catalytic_assessment_Understanding_how_MCQs_and_EVS_can_foster_deep_learning","221538903_Things_are_clicking_in_computer_science_courses","220807627_Using_interactive_technology_in_a_short_Java_course_An_experience_report","216743157_Peer_Instruction_Ten_Years_of_Experience_and_Results","6468149_Clickers_in_the_Large_Classroom_Current_Research_and_Best-Practice_Tips"]}
