{"id":"312408261_Citation_regression_analysis_of_computer_science_publications_in_different_ranking_categories_and_subfields","abstract":"A number of bibliometric studies point out that the role of conference publications in computer science differs from that in other traditional fields. Thus, it is interesting to identify the relative status of journal and conference publications in different subfields of computer science based on the citation rates categorised by the China Computer Federation (CCF) classifications and venue types. In this research, we construct a dataset containing over 100,000 papers recommended by the CCF catalogue and their citation information. We also investigate some other factors that often influence a paperâ€™s citation rate. An experimental study shows that the relative status of journals and conferences varies greatly in different subfields of computer science, and the impact of different publication levels varies according to the citation rate. We also verify that the classification of a publication, number of authors, maximum h-index of all authors of a paper, and average number of papers published by a publication have different effects on the citation rate, although the citation rate may have a different degree of correlation with these factors.","authors":["Yifan Qian","Wenge Rong","Jiang Nan","Jie Tang"],"meta":["January 2017Scientometrics 110(3)","DOI:10.1007/s11192-016-2235-4","Project: Science of Science"],"references":["275527716_Conferences_versus_journals_in_computer_science_Conferences_vs_Journals_in_Computer_Science","265089541_On_the_causes_of_subject-specific_citation_rates_in_Web_of_Science","294577114_Factors_affecting_number_of_citations_a_comprehensive_review_of_the_literature","291016239_Expected_number_of_citations_and_the_crown_indicator","282072609_More_Precise_Methods_for_National_Research_Citation_Impact_Comparisons","281739145_Regression_analysis_of_count_data_Second_edition","277818480_The_influence_of_time_and_discipline_on_the_magnitude_of_correlations_between_citation_counts_and_quality_scores","267456010_Regression_for_citation_data_An_evaluation_of_different_methods","264717090_The_Effect_on_Citation_Inequality_of_Differences_in_Citation_Practices_at_the_Web_of_Science_Subject_Category_Level","262492372_Factors_Affecting_Citation_Rates_of_Research_Articles"]}
