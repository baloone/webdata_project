{"id":"300009759_Synthesizing_Self-stabilization_through_Superposition_and_Backtracking","abstract":"While the design of self-stabilization is known to be a hard problem, several sound (but incomplete) heuristics exist for algorithmic design of self-stabilization. This paper presents a sound and complete method for algorithmic design of self-stabilizing network protocols. The essence of the proposed approach is based on variable superposition and backtracking search. We have validated the proposed method by creating both a sequential and a parallel implementation in the context of a software tool, called Protocon. Moreover, we have used Protocon to automatically design self-stabilizing protocols for the problems that all existing heuristics fail to solve.","authors":["Alex Klinkhamer","Ali Ebnenasir"],"meta":["September 2014","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-11764-5_18","Conference: Symposium on Self-Stabilizing Systems"],"references":["254037729_Swarm_Synthesis_of_Convergence_for_Symmetric_Protocols","221039131_Revising_Distributed_UNITY_Programs_Is_NP-Complete","220951051_A_Lightweight_Method_for_Automated_Design_of_Convergence","220404162_Synthesis_of_Fault-Tolerant_Concurrent_Programs","220102545_Transformation_of_Programs_for_Fault-Tolerance","34965464_Automatic_synthesis_of_fault-tolerance","2901560_Boosting_Combinatorial_Search_Through_Randomization","2825237_Uniform_Deterministic_Self-Stabilizing_Ring-Orientation_on_Odd-Length_Rings","2441410_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","319394978_Artificial_Intelligence_---_A_Modern_Approach","290462095_Parallel_Program_Design","280840782_Synthesizing_Round_Based_Fault-Tolerant_Programs_Using_Genetic_Programming","272161464_Artificial_Intelligence_A_Modern_Approach_Second_Edition","270631792_On_the_Hardness_of_Adding_Nonmasking_Fault_Tolerance","265457621_Parallel_Program_Design_A_Foundation","244421736_Component-based_design_of_fault-tolerance","234799689_SELF-STABILIZATION_BY_LOCAL_CHECKING_AND_CORRECTION","224285715_Artificial_Intelligence_A_Modern_Approach","222459197_The_local_detection_paradigm_and_its_applications_to_self-stabilization","222450697_Defining_liveness","221540552_Multicore_Constraint-Based_Automated_Stabilization","221343560_Self-Stabilizing_Extensions_for_Message-Passing_Systems","221278206_The_Theory_of_Weak_Stabilization","220695897_A_Discipline_of_Programming","220423523_Dijkstra_EW_Self-stabilizing_Systems_in_Spite_of_Distributed_Control_ACM_Commun_1711_643-644","220404181_Leader_Election_in_Uniform_Rings","220379865_The_Stabilizing_Token_Ring_in_Three_Bits","220152965_Automated_constraint-based_addition_of_nonmasking_and_stabilizing_fault-tolerance","200044349_Artificial_Intelligence_A_Modern_Approach","3516090_Structured_design_of_self-stabilizing_programs","3510367_Self-stabilization_by_local_checking_and_correction","3187618_Closure_and_Convergence_A_Foundation_of_Fault-Tolerant_Computing","3048285_A_Design_for_Directed_Graphs_with_Minimum_Diameter","3042811_Stabilizing_communication_protocols","2351748_Self-Stabilization_by_Counter_Flushing"]}
