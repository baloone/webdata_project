{"id":"336829373_IoT_Botnet_The_Largest_Threat_to_the_IoT_Network","abstract":"Adoption of the IoT technology is expanding exponentially. It is capable of providing a better service. IoT technology is successfully implemented on the bulb, refrigerator, air conditioner, washing machine, wristwatches, mobile phones, etc. Gartner report reflects that growth in the number of IoT devices is massive. By 2025, the number of IoT devices may reach up to 50 Billion. This growth poses an enormous range of challenges. The challenges are communication, interoperability, integration, data handling, privacy, and security. The major challenge is security. This paper focuses on different types of possible attacks on IoT and how the IoT botnet is gaining more attention and becoming a major attack. It highlights the key difference between traditional botnet and IoT botnet. Review of the existing techniques to deal with a botnet as well as the urge for a different technique to deal with IoT botnet is discussed.","authors":["Smita Dange","Madhumita Chatterjee"],"meta":["January 2020","DOI:10.1007/978-981-15-0132-6_10","In book: Data Communication and Networks (pp.137-157)","Project: IoT Security"],"references":["329316466_Towards_Situational_Awareness_of_Botnet_Activity_in_the_Internet_of_Things","326376629_A_Signature-based_Intrusion_Detection_System_for_the_Internet_of_Things","323912995_Internet_of_Things_Security_a_top-down_survey","323863656_A_method_to_detect_Internet_of_Things_botnets","322931850_A_Survey_on_Attacks_in_Internet_of_Things_Based_Networks","318288727_DDoS_in_the_IoT_Mirai_and_other_botnets","316117035_A_Roadmap_for_Security_Challenges_in_Internet_of_Things","301281714_Security_in_Internet_of_Things_Challenges_Solutions_and_Future_Directions","274893146_An_analysis_of_network_traffic_characteristics_for_Botnet_detection","267846973_Signature-based_Botnet_Detection_and_Prevention","261311447_Future_Internet_The_Internet_of_Things_Architecture_Possible_Applications_and_Key_Challenges","252012673_Botnets_Lifecycle_and_Taxonomy","222571757_The_Internet_of_Things_A_Survey","330472583_Unsupervised_Anomaly_Based_Botnet_Detection_in_IoT_Networks","330272549_Dimensionality_Reduction_for_Machine_Learning_Based_IoT_Botnet_Detection","330122990_IoT-Botnet_Detection_and_Isolation_by_Access_Routers","329973899_Detecting_bot-infected_machines_using_DNS_fingerprinting","329351471_Current_research_on_Internet_of_Things_IoT_security_A_survey","329292182_Monitoring_IoT_Networks_for_Botnet_Activity","328246279_N-BaIoT-Network-Based_Detection_of_IoT_Botnet_Attacks_Using_Deep_Autoencoders","327707113_The_Study_on_the_Botnet_and_its_Prevention_Policies_in_the_Internet_of_Things","327489247_UCAM_Usage_Communication_and_Access_Monitoring_Based_Detection_System_for_IoT_Botnets","324713093_Modeling_and_Clustering_Attacker_Activities_in_IoT_through_Machine_Learning_Techniques","322995082_On_security_challenges_and_open_issues_in_Internet_of_Things","320251025_Security_attacks_in_IoT_A_survey","318155608_Low-Complexity_Signature-Based_Malware_Detection_for_IoT_Devices","317117485_Chapter_14_The_Botnet_Problem","317100867_Internet_of_Things_Security_Research_A_Rehash_of_Old_Ideas_or_New_Intellectual_Challenges","313464793_Botnets_and_Internet_of_Things_Security","263050114_Detecting_botnet_by_anomalous_traffic","261134524_A_Survey_of_Internet-of-Things_Future_Vision_Architecture_Challenges_and_Services","257582085_Botnets_A_survey"]}
