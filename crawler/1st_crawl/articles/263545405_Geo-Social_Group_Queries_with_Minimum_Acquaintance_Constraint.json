{"id":"263545405_Geo-Social_Group_Queries_with_Minimum_Acquaintance_Constraint","abstract":"The prosperity of location-based social networking services enables\ngeo-social group queries for group-based activity planning and marketing. This\npaper proposes a new family of geo-social group queries with minimum\nacquaintance constraint (GSGQs), which are more appealing than existing\ngeo-social group queries in terms of producing a cohesive group that guarantees\nthe worst-case acquaintance level. GSGQs, also specified with various spatial\nconstraints, are more complex than conventional spatial queries; particularly,\nthose with a strict $k$NN spatial constraint are proved to be NP-hard. For\nefficient processing of general GSGQ queries on large location-based social\nnetworks, we devise two social-aware index structures, namely SaR-tree and\nSaR*-tree. The latter features a novel clustering technique that considers both\nspatial and social factors. Based on SaR-tree and SaR*-tree, efficient\nalgorithms are developed to process various GSGQs. Extensive experiments on\nreal-world Gowalla and Dianping datasets show that our proposed methods\nsubstantially outperform the baseline algorithms based on R-tree.","authors":["Qijun Zhu","Haibo Hu","Jianliang Xu","Wang-Chien Lee"],"meta":["October 2017The VLDB Journal 26(3â€“5)","DOI:10.1007/s00778-017-0473-6","SourcearXiv"],"references":["313453110_CoreScope_Graph_Mining_Using_k-Core_Analysis_-_Patterns_Anomalies_and_Algorithms","314237638_R-trees_a_dynamic_index_structure_for_spatial_searching","313708771_The_R-tree_An_efficient_and_robust_access_method_for_points_and_rectangles","313550720_IGSLR_Personalized_geo-social_location_recommendation_-_A_kernel_density_estimation_approach","301233247_Network_structure_and_minimum_degree","291019147_Towards_Social-Aware_Ridesharing_Group_Query_Services","290995561_Privacy-Preserving_Location_Sharing_Services_for_Social_Networks","283777683_IGeoRec_A_Personalized_and_Efficient_Geographical_Location_Recommendation_Framework","279401876_R-trees","277648994_Geo-Social_K-Cover_Group_Queries_for_Collaborative_Spatial_Computing"]}
