{"id":"238244343_Implicit_operations_on_finite_J-trivial_semigroups_and_a_conjecture_of_I_Simon","abstract":"Let J be the pseudovariety of all finite -trivial semigroups and let Ω̄nJ denote the topological semigroup of all n-ary implicit operations on J. The semigroup Ω̄nJ is generated by the n component projections together with the 2n−1 idempotents. Furthermore, Ω̄nJ is described as a free algebra of type (1,2) in a certain variety and the word problem is solved in this algebra. As a consequence, Ω̄nJ is countable, which settles a conjecture proposed by I. Simon.","authors":["Jorge Almeida"],"meta":["January 1991Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra 69(3)","DOI:10.1016/0022-4049(91)90019-X"],"references":["255712223_A_Course_in_Universal_Algebra","226989033_The_algebra_of_implicit_operations","267666683_Residually_finite_congruences_and_quasi-regular_subsets_in_uniform_algebras","265436996_Algebraic_Combinatorics_on_Words","264957936_General_Topology","256206328_Partially_ordered_finite_monoids_and_a_theorem_of_I_Simon","246430901_Implicit_Operations_on_Certain_Classes_of_Semigroups","244508705_The_join_of_the_pseudovarieties_of_R-trivial_and_L-trivial_monoids","234798109_Varieties_Of_Formal_Languages","226897983_The_Birkhoff_theorem_for_finite_algebras","225975653_The_Birkhoff_Theorem_for_varieties_of_finite_algebras","225658938_On_finite_I-trivial_monoidsmonoids","221256650_Equations_for_pseudovarieties","221220325_Piecewise_testable_events"]}
