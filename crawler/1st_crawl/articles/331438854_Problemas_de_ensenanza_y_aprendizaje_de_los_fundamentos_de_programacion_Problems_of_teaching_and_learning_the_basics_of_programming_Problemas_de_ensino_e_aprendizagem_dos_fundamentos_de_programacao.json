With this situation, which apparently is quite common at the global level, the causes of this problem are related to certain characteristics that happen inside the classroom. Certain cognitive skills are relevant at\nthe time of learning the basics of programming, such as the ability of abstraction, a good logical-mathematical\naptitude and ability to solve algorithmic order problems. In addition, motivators are necessary when faced with the issues associated with programming fundamentals in practice settings. The content of this review involves experiences in different areas of the planet, whose interest aims to uncover the origins of the problem. Finally, a reflection is made in the search for possible solutions, and where the performance space is opened to a new orientation based on the core of the Essence of Semat.","authors":["Jesus Insuasti"],"meta":["June 2016","DOI:10.18359/reds.1701","Project: DIDACTIC TRANSPOSITION AND TEACHING OF COMPUTER PROGRAMMING FUNDAMENTALS"],"references":["221538839_New_roles_for_students_instructors_and_computers_in_a_lab-based_introductory_programming_course","221538551_Learning_styles_and_performance_in_an_introductory_programming_sequence","221538531_The_role_of_language_paradigms_in_teaching_programming","311465209_Gender_differences_in_programming","270607102_Testing_first","267438704_An_introduction_to_programming_using_Visual_Basic_40_Incl_1_CD-ROM_2nd_ed","265142336_Design_Patterns_in_Learning_to_Program","239062196_Learning_to_Program_with_Alice_Prentice-Hall","234781934_Making_CS0_fun_an_active_learning_approach_using_toys_games_and_Alice","224757861_Establishing_structured_support_for_programming_students","215900261_Lowering_the_barriers_to_programming_A_taxonomy_of_programming_environments_and_languages_for_novice_programmers","31841926_An_Introduction_to_Programming_Using_Alice_CW_Herbert"]}
