{"id":"283946814_Thermophysical_databases_From_tables_to_interactive_internet_resources_and_cloud_templates","abstract":"Internet resources with information on thermalâ€“physical properties of technologically important substances are analyzed. Databases put online by a number of organizations (the Joint Institute for High Temperatures of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Standartinform, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the Institute for Thermal Physics of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, etc.) are reviewed. Custom functions and cloud templates for the calculation of the thermal properties of substances and solutions to some applied problems are considered.","authors":["Valery Ochkov","Evgenii Evguenyevich Ustyuzhanin","Ch.
