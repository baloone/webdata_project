{"id":"328398755_Computation_by_natural_systems","abstract":"Computation is a useful concept far beyond the disciplinary boundaries of computer science. Perhaps the most important class of natural computers can be found in biological systems that perform computation on multiple levels. From molecular and cellular information processing networks to ecol-ogies, economies and brains, life computes. Despite ubiquitous agreement on this fact going back as far as von Neumann automata and McCulloch–Pitts neural nets, we so far lack principles to understand rigorously how computation is done in living, or active, matter. What is the ultimate nature of natural computation that has evolved, and how can we use these principles to engineer intelligent technologies and biological tissues? © 2018 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.
