{"id":"278048481_Flowing_ConvNets_for_Human_Pose_Estimation_in_Videos","abstract":"The objective of this work is human pose estimation in videos, where multiple\nframes are available. We investigate a ConvNet architecture that is able to\nbenefit from temporal context by combining information across the multiple\nframes using optical flow.\nTo this end we propose a new network architecture that: (i) regresses a\nconfidence heatmap of joint position predictions; (ii) incorporates optical\nflow at a mid-layer to align heatmap predictions from neighbouring frames; and\n(iii) includes a final parametric pooling layer which learns to combine the\naligned heatmaps into a pooled confidence map.\nWe show that this architecture outperforms a number of others, including one\nthat uses optical flow solely at the input layers, and one that regresses joint\ncoordinates directly.\nThe new architecture outperforms the state of the art by a large margin on\nthree video pose estimation datasets, including the very challenging Poses in\nthe Wild dataset.","authors":["Tomas Pfister","James Charles","Andrew Zisserman"],"meta":["June 2015","DOI:10.1109/ICCV.2015.222","SourcearXiv"],"references":["319769910_Efficient_piecewise_training_of_deep_structure_models_for_semantic_segmentation","319770430_Rich_feature_hierarchies_for_accurate_object_detection_and_semantic_segmentation","319770276_CNN_Features_off-the-shelf_an_Astounding_Baseline_for_Recognition","319770268_Joint_Training_of_a_Convolutional_Network_and_a_Graphical_Model_for_Human_Pose_Estimation","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","311610893_Efficient_Piecewise_Training_of_Deep_Structured_Models_for_Semantic_Segmentation","310752533_Visualizing_and_understanding_convolutional_networks","309076254_Gradientbased_learning_applied_to_document_recognition","307719713_Efficient_object_localization_using_Convolutional_Networks","286594663_Using_k-Poselets_for_Detecting_People_and_Localizing_Their_Keypoints"]}
