{"id":"220775742_Parallel_Execution_of_AES-CTR_Algorithm_Using_Extended_Block_Size","abstract":"Data encryption and decryption are common operations in a network based application programs with security. In order to keep pace with the input data rate in such applications, real-time processing of data encryption/decryption is essential. For example, in an environment where a multimedia data is streamed, high speed data encryption/decryption is crucial. In this paper, we propose a new approach to parallelize AES-CTR algorithm by extending the size of the block which is encrypted at one time across the unit block boundaries. The proposed approach leads to significant performance improvements using a general-purpose multi-core processor and a Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) which become popular these days. In particular, the performance improvement on GPU is dramatic, close to 9-times faster compared with the original coarse-grain parallelization approach, mainly thanks to the \"multi-core\" nature of the GPU architecture.","authors":["Nhat-Phuong Tran","Myungho Lee","Sugwon Hong","Seung-Jae Lee"],"meta":["August 2011","DOI:10.1109/CSE.2011.43","SourceDBLP","Conference: 14th IEEE International Conference on Computational Science and Engineering, CSE 2011, Dalian, China, August 24-26, 2011"],"references":["224561575_Design_of_a_parallel_AES_for_graphics_hardware_using_the_CUDA_framework","220781807_Efficient_gather_and_scatter_operations_on_graphics_processors","220422248_A_closer_look_at_GPUs","2237728_AES_proposal_rijndael","262493452_Parallel_Programming_in_OpenMP","257420653_Opportunities_and_challenges","247355962_Recommendation_for_Block_Cipher_Modes_of_Operation_The_CCM_Mode_for_Authentication_and_Confidentiality","235720528_AES_the_Advanced_Encryption_Standard","235183820_Recommendation_for_Block_Cipher_Modes_of_Operation_Methods_and_Techniques","224581828_Benchmarking_GPUs_to_tune_dense_linear_algebra","221611859_High_speed_network_traffic_analysis_with_commodity_multi-core_systems","220687895_The_Design_of_Rijndael_AES_-_The_Advanced_Encryption_Standard","4206718_nCap_wire-speed_packet_capture_and_transmission","3453105_Parallel_programming_in_C_with_MPI_and_OpenMP"]}
