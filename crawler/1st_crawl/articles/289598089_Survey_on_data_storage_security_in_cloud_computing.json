{"id":"289598089_Survey_on_data_storage_security_in_cloud_computing","abstract":"Cloud Computing is a general term used to describe a new class of network based computing that takes place over the Internet, for communication and transport provides hardware, software and networking services to clients. In addition, the platform provides on demand services, that are always on, anywhere, anytime and any place. It has an ability to provide users dynamically scalable, shared resources over the Internet and avoid large upfront fixed costs. Along with these advantages, storing a large amount of data including critical information on the cloud motivates highly skilled hackers thus creating a need for the security to be considered as one of the top issues. Lack of security is the only a problem or difficulty that must be overcome in wide adoption of cloud computing. Cloud computing has brought lots of security challenges for the consumers and service providers. In this paper we emphasize on various security threats in cloud computing also the existing methods to control them and explain the cloud computing along with its open secure architecture.","authors":["J.
