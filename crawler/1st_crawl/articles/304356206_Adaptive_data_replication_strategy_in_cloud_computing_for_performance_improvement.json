{"id":"304356206_Adaptive_data_replication_strategy_in_cloud_computing_for_performance_improvement","abstract":"Cloud computing is becoming a very popular word in industry and is receiving a large amount of attention from the research community. Replica management is one of the most important issues in the cloud, which can offer fast data access time, high data availability and reliability. By keeping all replicas active, the replicas may enhance system task successful execution rate if the replicas and requests are reasonably distributed. However, appropriate replica placement in a large-scale, dynamically scalable and totally virtualized data centers is much more complicated. To provide cost-effective availability, minimize the response time of applications and make load balancing for cloud storage, a new replica placement is proposed. The replica placement is based on five important parameters: mean service time, failure probability, load variance, latency and storage usage. However, replication should be used wisely because the storage size of each site is limited. Thus, the site must keep only the important replicas.We also present a new replica replacement strategy based on the availability of the file, the last time the replica was requested, number of access, and size of replica. We evaluate our algorithm using the CloudSim simulator and find that it offers better performance in comparison with other algorithms in terms of mean response time, effective network usage, load balancing, replication frequency, and storage usage.","authors":["Najme Mansouri"],"meta":["June 2016Frontiers of Computer Science (electronic) 10(5)","DOI:10.1007/s11704-016-5182-6"],"references":["221201604_CDRM_A_Cost-Effective_Dynamic_Replication_Management_Scheme_for_Cloud_Storage_Cluster","220941758_Replica_Placement_Design_with_Static_Optimality_and_Dynamic_Maintainability","220716384_A_Novel_Cost-Effective_Dynamic_Data_Replication_Strategy_for_Reliability_in_Cloud_Data_Centres","41560167_A_self-organized_fault-tolerant_and_scalable_replication_scheme_for_cloud_storage","2962080_The_Case_for_Energy-Proportional_Computing","2918331_UK_Grid_Simulation_with_OptorSim","313038610_A_scalable_commodity_data_center_network_architecture","312917980_The_Google_file_system","295867790_A_comprehensive_review_of_the_data_replication_techniques_in_the_cloud_environments_Major_trends_and_future_directions","286679629_An_improved_dynamic_data_replica_selection_and_placement_in_cloud","273958537_Virtual_machine_selection_and_placement_for_dynamic_consolidation_in_Cloud_computing_environment","271917664_Network_and_data_location_aware_approach_for_simultaneous_job_scheduling_and_data_replication_in_large-scale_data_grid_environments","265218367_A_Light-weight_Data_Replication_for_Cloud_Data_Centers_Environment","262177889_Scalable_service-oriented_replication_with_flexible_consistency_guarantee_in_the_cloud","261332301_Energy-Aware_Replica_Selection_for_Data-Intensive_Services_in_Cloud","261119832_A_QoS-aware_Dynamic_Data_Replica_Deletion_Strategy_for_Distributed_Storage_Systems_under_Cloud_Computing_Environments","257721122_A_benefit-aware_on-demand_provisioning_approach_for_multi-tier_applications_in_cloud_computing","257721084_An_online_service-oriented_performance_profiling_tool_for_cloud_computing_systems","257489343_A_dynamic_replica_management_strategy_in_data_grid","257252419_Enhanced_Dynamic_Hierarchical_Replication_and_Weighted_Scheduling_Strategy_in_Data_Grid","242565920_Problem_Decomposition_and_Data_Reorganization_by_a_Clustering_Technique","239723982_An_Optimal_Continuous_Media_Replication_Strategy_for_Ad-hoc_Networks_of_Wireless_Devices","239021588_Simjava_A_discrete_event_simulation_package_for_Java_with_applications_in_computer_systems_modelling","228346723_The_Hadoop_Distributed_File_System","223058032_A_study_on_performance_of_dynamic_file_replication_algorithms_for_real-time_file_access_in_Data_Grids","222570041_A_data_placement_strategy_in_scientific_cloud_workflows","221453722_Content_and_service_replication_strategies_in_multi-hop_wireless_mesh_networks","221324312_Lowest_Data_Replication_Storage_of_Binary_Vote_Assignment_Data_Grid","220910111_The_Google_File_System","220851866_MapReduce_Simplified_Data_Processing_on_Large_Clusters","220718202_Differentiated_Replication_Strategy_in_Data_Centers","220702431_Near_Optimal_Number_of_Replicas_for_Continuous_Media_in_Ad-hoc_Networks_of_Wireless_Devices","220477099_NCSA's_World_Wide_Web_server_Design_and_performance","220280566_CloudSim_A_Toolkit_for_Modeling_and_Simulation_of_Cloud_Computing_Environments_and_Evaluation_of_Resource_Provisioning_Algorithms","220104896_Reliability_in_Grid_Computing_Systems","37469283_Dynamic_Cost-Efficient_Replication_in_Data_Clouds","3436780_Benefit-Based_Data_Caching_in_Ad_Hoc_Networks","3049710_SEA_A_Striping-Based_Energy-Aware_Strategy_for_Data_Placement_in_RAID-Structured_Storage_Systems","2617210_Directed_Diffusion_A_Scalable_and_Robust_Communication_Paradigm_for_Sensor_Networks","2494112_On_the_Placement_of_Web_Server_Replicas","2422874_SimJava_A_discrete_event_simulation_library_for_Java"]}
