{"id":"303846486_Generating_SAT_instances_with_community_structure","abstract":"Nowadays, modern SAT solvers are able to efficiently solve many industrial, or real-world, SAT instances. However, the process of development and testing of new SAT solving techniques is conditioned to the finite and reduced number of known industrial benchmarks. Therefore, new models of random SAT instances generation that capture realistically the features of real-world problems can be beneficial to the SAT community. In many works, the structure of industrial instances has been analyzed representing them as graphs and studying some of their properties, like modularity.","authors":["Jesús Giráldez-Cru","Jordi Levy"],"meta":["June 2016Artificial Intelligence 238(2)","DOI:10.1016/j.artint.2016.06.001"],"references":["300349278_Using_Community_Structure_to_Detect_Relevant_Learnt_Clauses","281317160_SATGraf_Visualizing_the_Evolution_of_SAT_Formula_Structure_in_Solvers","279633448_Understanding_VSIDS_Branching_Heuristics_in_Conflict-Driven_Clause-Learning_SAT_Solvers","277325988_A_Modularity-based_Random_SAT_Instances_Generator","266859239_Impact_of_Community_Structure_on_SAT_Solver_Performance","262209710_The_Community_Structure_of_SAT_Formulas","256091628_The_Fractal_Dimension_of_SAT_Formulas","230841621_Popularity_versus_Similarity_in_Growing_Networks","221633253_On_the_Structure_of_Industrial_SAT_Instances","221632835_Ten_Challenges_Redux_Recent_Progress_in_Propositional_Reasoning_and_Search","221604343_Measuring_the_Hardness_of_SAT_Instances","221045246_Random_SAT_instances_a_la_carte","220944585_March_eq_Implementing_Additional_Reasoning_into_an_Efficient_Look-Ahead_SAT_Solver","220814697_Towards_Industrial-Like_Random_SAT_Instances","12779869_Albert_R_Emergence_of_Scaling_in_Random_Networks_Science_286_509-512","2799095_Ten_Challenges_in_Propositional_Reasoning_and_Search","2769087_Hard_and_Easy_Distributions_of_SAT_Problems","2599185_Generating_Satisfiable_Problem_Instances","2583139_Problem_Structure_in_the_Presence_of_Perturbations","2375054_Morphing_Combining_Structure_and_Randomness","284411763_An_extensible_SAT-solver","283617410_Emergence_of_Scaling_in_Random_Networks","276211380_Exploiting_Resolution-Based_Representations_for_MaxSAT_Solving","273788365_Hyperbolic_Graph_Generator","266966129_Community_Branching_for_Parallel_Portfolio_SAT_Solvers","262398457_Finding_Efficient_Circuits_for_Ensemble_Computation","262332209_Eigenvector_Centrality_in_Industrial_SAT_Instances","262271029_Creating_Industrial-Like_SAT_Instances_by_Clustering_and_Reconstruction","262218305_Community-Based_Partitioning_for_MaxSAT_Solving","253253918_Detecting_Community_Structure_in_Networks","221591101_The_Complexity_of_Theorem-Proving_Procedures","220934729_Modelling_More_Realistic_SAT_Problems","220812877_Predicting_Learnt_Clauses_Quality_in_Modern_SAT_Solvers","8463952_Fast_algorithm_for_detecting_community_structure_in_networks_Phys_Rev_E_Stat_Nonlin_Soft_Matter_Phys_696_Pt_2_066133","8036129_Finding_community_structure_in_very_large_networks","7659762_Finding_and_Evaluating_Community_Structure_in_Networks","3674796_GRASP-A_new_search_algorithm_for_satisfiability","3297832_On_Modularity_Clustering","2951260_Search_in_a_Small_World"]}
