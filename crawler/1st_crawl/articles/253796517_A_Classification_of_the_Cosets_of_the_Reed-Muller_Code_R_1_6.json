{"id":"253796517_A_Classification_of_the_Cosets_of_the_Reed-Muller_Code_R_1_6","abstract":"The weight distribution of a coset of a Reed-Muller code R(1,m) is invariant under a large transformation group consisting of all affine rearrangements of a vector space with dimension m. We discuss a general algorithm that produces an ordered list of orbit representatives for this group action. As a by-product the procedure finds the order of the symmetry group of a coset. With m = 6 we can implement the algorithm on a computer and find that there are 150357 equivalence classes. These classes produce 2082 distinct weight distributions. Their symmetry groups have 122 different orders.","authors":["James A.
