{"id":"247051718_On_The_Yielding_of_Soils","abstract":"Synopsis Hvorslev's equation for the shear strength of clay is shown to define a surface in a space of three variables σ′, e and τ. The progressive yielding of a sample defines a loading path in this space, and the paths taken by samples in differing tests can be correlated if a boundary energy correction is applied. The final portions of all paths then lie in a unique surface, and the paths end at a unique critical voids ratio line. At the critical voids ratio state unlimited deformation can take place while σ′, e and τ remain constant. The two concepts of the existence of such a surface and such a critical voids ratio line are verified by an analysis of results of triaxial tests on a clay. Similar tests on silt and sand also confirm the concepts, although some inaccuracy is inherent in these tests. Finally results of tests on granular media in a simple shear apparatus are presented which confirm closely the applicability of both concepts to the yielding of granular media.
