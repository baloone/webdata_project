{"id":"304747862_Finite_Element_Approximation_of_an_Unsteady_Projection-Based_VMS_Turbulence_Model_with_Wall_Laws","abstract":"In this work we present the numerical analysis and study the performance of a finite element projection-based Variational MultiScale (VMS) turbulence model that includes general non-linear wall laws. We introduce Lagrange finite element spaces adapted to approximate the slip condition. The sub-grid effects are modeled by an eddy diffusion term that acts only on a range of small resolved scales. Moreover, high-order stabilization terms are considered, with the double aim to guarantee stability for coarse meshes, and help to counterbalance the accumulation of sub-grid energy together with the sub-grid eddy viscosity term. We prove stability and convergence for solutions that only need to bear the natural minimal regularity, in unsteady regime. We also study the asymptotic energy balance of the system. We finally include some numerical tests to assess the performance of the model described in this work.","authors":["Tomás Chacón Rebollo","Macarena Gómez Mármol","Samuele Rubino"],"meta":["August 2015","In book: Boundary and Interior Layers, Computational and Asymptotic Methods -­ BAIL 2014 (pp.47-73)Edition: 2014Publisher: Springer Series: Lecture Notes in Computational Science and Engineering (Vol. 108)Editors: Petr Knobloch"],"references":["266144171_Derivation_of_the_Smagorinsky_Model_from_a_Galerkin_Discretization","243777258_Direct_Numerical_Simulation_of_Turbulent_Channel_Flow_up_to_Re590","243098819_Korn's_Inequalities_and_Their_Applications_in_Continuum_Mechanics","242922462_Finite_Element_Interpolation_of_Nonsmooth_Functions_Satisfying_Boundary_Conditions","241054015_Variational_multiscale_residual-based_turbulence_modeling_for_large_eddy_simulation_of_incompressible_flows","235438774_A_Variational_Finite_Element_Model_for_Large-Eddy_Simulations_ofTurbulent_Flows","228469448_The_multiscale_formulation_of_large_eddy_simulation_Decay_of_homogeneous_isotropic_turbulence","222614643_Comparison_of_some_finite_element_methods_for_solving_the_diffusion-convection-reaction_equation","41700523_Chacon_Rebollo_T_An_analysis_technique_for_stabilized_finite_element_solution_of_incompressible_flows_M2AN_Math_Model_Numer_Anal_35_57-89","350442573_Mathematics_of_Large_Eddy_Simulation_of_Turbulent_Flows","313596156_Quelques_methodes_de_resolution_des_problems_aux_limites_non_lineaires","304748239_Analysis_of_a_Full_Space-Time_Discretization_of_the_Navier-Stokes_Equations_by_a_Local_Projection_Stabilization_Method","302434881_Compact_sets_in_the_space_L_p0_T_B_Ann","301067292_Large_Eddy_Simulation_of_a_round_jet_in_a_cross-flow","285599357_Large_Eddy_simulation_and_the_variation_multiscale_method","276481718_Numerical_Analysis_of_Penalty_Stabilized_Finite_Element_Discretizations_of_Evolution_Navier-Stokes_Equations","269401530_Numerical_analysis_of_a_finite_element_projection-based_VMS_turbulence_model_with_wall_laws","267433895_A_high_order_term-by-term_stabilization_solver_for_incompressible_flow_problems","266936962_Mechanische_Ahnlichkeit_und_Turbulenz","266080352_Mathematical_and_Numerical_Foundations_of_Turbulence_Models","260270416_Numerical_approximation_of_the_Smagorinsky_turbulence_model_applied_to_the_primitive_equations_of_the_ocean","252125993_Finite_element_aproximation_of_steady_Navier-Stokes_equations_with_mixed_boundary_conditions","247039670_On_the_Flow_of_Water_in_Open_Channels_and_Pipes","246294423_General_Circulation_Experiments_with_the_Primitive_Equations_I_The_Basic_Experiment","245495148_Existence_uniqueness_and_regularity_of_solution_of_the_equations_of_a_turbulence_model_for_incompressible_fluids","234453523_A_Single_Formula_for_the_Law_of_the_Wall''","230675440_Bericht_uber_Untersuchen_zur_ausgebildeten_Turbulenz","230605926_On_Turbulent_Flow_near_a_Wall","228937776_Finite_element_error_analysis_for_a_projection-based_variational_multiscale_method_with_nonlinear_eddy_viscosity","228554689_Large_eddy_simulation_of_turbulent_channel_flows_by_the_variational_multiscale_method","226393393_Finite_element_approximation_of_incompressible_Navier-Stokes_equations_with_slip_boundary_condition_II","226311584_Large_Eddy_Simulation_and_the_variational_multiscale_method","223546856_Isogeometric_variational_multiscale_modeling_of_wall-bounded_turbulent_flows_with_weakly_enforced_boundary_conditions_on_unstretched_meshes","223044817_The_variational_multiscale_method_-_A_paradigm_for_computational_mechanics","222834861_Variational_multiscale_residual-based_turbulence_modeling_for_large_eddy_simulation_of_incompressible_flows","222554120_Numerical_studies_of_finite_element_variational_multiscale_methods_for_turbulent_flow_simulations","222414900_Weak_Dirichlet_boundary_conditions_for_wall-bounded_turbulent_flows_Comput_Methods_Appl_Mech_Eng_196_4853-4862","222298168_Scale-separating_operators_for_variational_multiscale_large_eddy_simulation_of_turbulent_flows","215618136_Quelques_Methodes_De_Resolution_Des_Problemes_Aux_Limites_Non_Lineaires_French","27351594_Adaptive_Variational_Multiscale_Formulations_using_the_Discrete_Germano","23855104_Effects_of_the_Computational_Time_Step_on_Numerical_Solutions_of_Turbulent_Flow","4661187_Numerical_investigation_of_turbulent_channel_flow"]}
