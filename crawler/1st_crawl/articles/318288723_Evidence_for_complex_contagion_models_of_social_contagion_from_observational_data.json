{"id":"318288723_Evidence_for_complex_contagion_models_of_social_contagion_from_observational_data","abstract":"Social influence can lead to behavioural 'fads' that are briefly popular and quickly die out. Various models have been proposed for these phenomena, but empirical evidence of their accuracy as real-world predictive tools has so far been absent. Here we find that a 'complex contagion' model accurately describes the spread of behaviours driven by online sharing. We found that standard, 'simple', contagion often fails to capture both the rapid spread and the long tails of popularity seen in real fads, where our complex contagion model succeeds. Complex contagion also has predictive power: it successfully predicted the peak time and duration of the ALS Icebucket Challenge. The fast spread and longer duration of fads driven by complex contagion has important implications for activities such as publicity campaigns and charity drives. Â© 2017 Sprague, House.
