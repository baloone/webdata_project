{"id":"276256485_The_integration_of_verbal_and_non-verbal_material_in_some_instances_of_written_scientific_discourse","abstract":"The article addresses the problem of the integration of dissimilar modes of representation (verbal, partially-verbal, and visual) found in some instances of written scientific discourse. It is based on the study of thirty scientific papers written in English by NS and NNS researchers in the field of mechanical engineering and computer-aided design and manufacturing. Various types of lexico-syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic/rhetorical devices which usually achieve cohesion in strictly verbal discourse are considered in the perspective of hybrid discourse integration. Reference is made to several representative approaches and to research into the communicative value of visual representation.","authors":["Claude Sionis"],"meta":["April 1997ASp 15(15-18):339-355","DOI:10.4000/asp.3191"],"references":["264638707_English_for_Specific_Purposes_International_in_Scope_Specific_in_Purpose","249738419_Physicists_Reading_Physics_Schema-Laden_Purposes_and_Purpose-Laden_Schema","307709507_L'analyse_du_discours","300711395_Integrated_Design_and_Manufacturing_for_Precision_Mechanical_Components","275998717_English_for_Science_and_Technology_A_Discourse_Approach","275915637_L'article_scientifique_un_produit_culturel","275779388_English_for_Specific_Purposes_A_Learning-Centred_Approach","269540662_Subject_specificity_in_ESP_How_much_does_the_teacher_need_to_know_of_the_subject","269540500_La_cohesion_dans_les_productions_ecrites_d'etudiants_en_anglais_de_specialite_un_probleme_culturel","266405379_Learning_Purpose_and_Language_Use","264554306_CADAnalysis_Integration","264381530_Initiating_ESL_Students_into_the_Academic_Discourse_Community_How_Far_Should_We_Go","260752248_ARCHiPLAN_a_New_Tool_of_Conceptual_Design_in_Architecture","249721556_Discipline_and_the_Material_Form_of_Images_An_Analysis_of_Scientific_Visibility","234653864_Teaching_Reading_Skills_in_a_Foreign_Language_New_Edition","231757148_Discourse_Processing_Effort_and_Perceptions_of_Comprehensibility_in_Nonnative_Discourse","49550473_Teaching_Language_as_Communication","49497640_Exploration_in_Applied_Linguistics","37118965_Papers_on_Functional_Sentence_Perspective"]}
