{"id":"319254591_Computability_of_the_Radon-Nikodym_Derivative","abstract":"We study the computational content of the Radon-Nokodym theorem from measure theory in the framework of the representation approach to computable analysis. We define computable measurable spaces and canonical representations of the measures and the integrable functions on such spaces. For functions f, g on represented sets, f is W-reducible to g if f can be computed by applying the function g at most once. Let RN be the Radon-Nikodym operator on the space under consideration and let EC be the non-computable operator mapping every enumeration of a set of natural numbers to its characteristic function. We prove that for every computable measurable space, RN is W-reducible to EC, and we construct a computable measurable space for which EC is W-reducible to RN.","authors":["Mathieu Hoyrup","Cristobal Rojas","Klaus Weihrauch"],"meta":["January 2012Computability 1(1):3-13","DOI:10.3233/COM-2012-005"],"references":["222422173_Uniform_test_of_algorithmic_randomness_over_a_general_space","346675622_Subsystems_of_Second_Order_Arithmetic","327195893_Mass-_und_Integrationstheorie","268246360_Elementary_Computable_Topology","245322024_An_Elementary_Treatment_of_the_Radon-Nikodym_Derivative","239066344_Probability_Theory_and_Elements_of_Measure_Theory","226659904_A_Tutorial_on_Computable_Analysis","224010977_Real_and_Complex_Analysis","222658855_A_constructive_Borel-Cantelli_Lemma_Constructing_orbits_with_required_statistical_properties","222416685_Representing_probability_measures_using_probabilistic_processes"]}
