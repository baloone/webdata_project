{"id":"280912015_Eliminating_Higher-Multiplicity_Intersections_I_A_Whitney_Trick_for_Tverberg-Type_Problems","abstract":"Motivated by topological Tverberg-type problems and by classical results\nabout embeddings (maps without double points), we study the question whether a\nfinite simplicial complex K can be mapped into R^d without triple, quadruple,\nor, more generally, r-fold points. Specifically, we are interested in maps f\nfrom K to R^d that have no r-Tverberg points, i.e., no r-fold points with\npreimages in r pairwise disjoint simplices of K, and we seek necessary and\nsufficient conditions for the existence of such maps.\nWe present a higher-multiplicity analogue of the completeness of the Van\nKampen obstruction for embeddability in twice the dimension. Specifically, we\nshow that under suitable restrictions on the dimensions, a well-known Deleted\nProduct Criterion (DPC) is not only necessary but also sufficient for the\nexistence of maps without r-Tverberg points. Our main technical tool is a\nhigher-multiplicity version of the classical Whitney trick.\nAn important guiding idea for our work was that sufficiency of the DPC,\ntogether with an old result of Ozaydin on the existence of equivariant maps,\nmight yield an approach to disproving the remaining open cases of the\nlong-standing topological Tverberg conjecture. Unfortunately, our proof of the\nsufficiency of the DPC requires a \"codimension 3\" proviso, which is not\nsatisfied for when K is the N-simplex.\nRecently, Frick found an extremely elegant way to overcome this last\n\"codimension 3\" obstacle and to construct counterexamples to the topological\nTverberg conjecture for d at least 3r+1 (r not a prime power). Here, we present\na different construction that yields counterexamples for d at least 3r (r not a\nprime power).","authors":["Isaac Mabillard","Uli Wagner"],"meta":["August 2015","SourcearXiv"],"references":["260039404_Embeddability_in_the_3-sphere_is_decidable","259572159_Tverberg_plus_constraints","251566772_Algorithmic_Solvability_of_the_Lifting-Extension_Problem","244954707_A_Generalization_of_Radon's_Theorem","220983362_On_the_Number_of_Halving_Planes","220441789_On_the_number_of_halving_planes","45880632_Optimal_bounds_for_the_colored_Tverberg_problem","315070647_The_Borsuk-Ulam_Theorem","307891187_L'elimination_des_points_doubles_dans_le_cas_combinatoire","284692927_Uber_wesentlich_unplattbare_Kurven_im_dreidimensionalen_Raume","281053607_Introduction_to_Piecewise-Linear_Topology","268667589_Problems_in_Geometric_Convexity","266656379_Eliminating_Tverberg_Points_I_An_Analogue_of_the_Whitney_Trick","266515514_Concordance_Isotopy_and_Diffeotopy","266505360_Plongements_de_varietes_dans_le_domaine_stable","266002172_User's_guide_to_equivariant_methods_in_combinatorics_II","265436883_Obstructions_to_the_Imbedding_of_a_Complex_in_a_Euclidean_Space_I_The_First_Obstruction","265433053_On_a_Topological_Generalization_of_a_Theorem_of_Tverberg","265330092_Transformation_Groups","260908567_A_Theory_of_Imbedding_Immersion_and_Isotopy_of_Polytopes_in_a_Euclidean_Space","256392455_The_colored_Tverberg's_problem_and_complexes_of_injective_functions","256364439_Transversality_for_piecewise_linear_manifolds","249872763_Tverberg_partitions_and_Borsuk-Ulam_theorems","248390470_Algebraic_Topology","246516450_Intersections_and_transformations_of_manifolds","244956494_A_generalization_of_Radon's_theorem_II","243064610_A_Generalized_van_Kampen-Flores_Theorem","242993639_Quasi_embeddings_and_embeddings_of_polyhedra_in_Rm","242963835_On_a_common_generalization_of_Borsuk's_and_Radon's_theorem","242352379_Toward_a_theory_of_crossing_numbers","231780356_On_transversality","228580835_Van_Kampen's_embedding_Obstruction_is_incomplete_for_2-Complexes_in_rz4","228557052_New_results_on_embeddings_of_polyhedra_and_manifolds_in_Euclidean_spaces","228390312_Piecewise_Linear_Topology","226356506_Komplexe_in_euklidischen_Raumen","226012021_L'elimination_des_points_doubles_dans_le_cas_combinatoire","226010104_Fast_Computation_Of_The_Smith_Form_Of_A_Sparse_Integer_Matrix","225712394_On_the_van_Kampen-Flores_theorem","225642670_On_a_topological_generalization_of_Tverberg's_theorem","225333933_Plongements_de_polyedres_dans_le_domaine_metastable","225194144_A_one-dimensional_Whitney_trick_and_Kuratowski's_graph_planarity_criterion","223328187_Embeddings_of_homology_equivalent_manifolds_with_boundary","222434144_Removing_Even_Crossings","222395621_On_Efficient_Sparse_Integer_Matrix_Smith_Normal_Form_Computations","222130919_Embeddings_of_polyhedra_in_Rm_and_the_deleted_product_obstruction","222033555_Using_equivariant_obstruction_theory_in_combinatorial_geometry","38323121_e-mappings_and_generalized_manifolds","30990071_Extending_Piecewise-Linear_Isotopies","4776832_A_Colored_Version_of_Tverberg's_Theorem","2333464_Near_Optimal_Algorithms_for_Computing_Smith_Normal_Forms_of_Integer_Matrices","2127032_Embedding_and_knotting_of_manifolds_in_Euclidean_spaces","2133637_The_van_Kampen_obstruction_and_its_relatives","1746065_On_approximability_by_embeddings_of_cycles_in_the_plane","1739944_Hardness_of_embedding_simplicial_complexes_in_Rd"]}
