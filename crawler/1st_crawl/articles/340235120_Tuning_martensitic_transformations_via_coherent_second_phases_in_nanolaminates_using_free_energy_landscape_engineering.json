{"id":"340235120_Tuning_martensitic_transformations_via_coherent_second_phases_in_nanolaminates_using_free_energy_landscape_engineering","abstract":"We explore the possibilities and limitations of using a coherent second phase to engineer the thermo-mechanical properties of a martensitic alloy by modifying the underlying free energy landscape that controls the transformation. We use molecular dynamics simulations of a model atomistic system where the properties of a coherent, nanoscale second phase can be varied systematically. With a base martensitic material that undergoes a temperature-induced transformation from a cubic austenite to a monoclinic martensite, simulations show significant ability to engineer the transformation temperatures, from a ∼50% reduction to a ∼200% increase, with 50 at. % of the cubic second phase. We establish correlations between the properties of the second phase, the transformation characteristics, and the microstructure via the free energy landscape of the two-phase systems. Coherency stresses have a strong influence on the martensitic variants observed and can even cause the non-martensitic second phase to undergo a transformation. Reducing the stiffness of the second phase increases the transformation strain and modifies the martensitic microstructure, increasing the volume fraction of the transformed material. This increase in transformation strain is accompanied by a significant increase in Af and thermal hysteresis, while Ms remains unaltered. Our findings on the tunability of martensitic transformations can be used for informed searches of second phases to achieve desired material properties, such as achieving room temperature, lightweight shape memory alloys.","authors":["Saaketh Desai","Samuel Temple Reeve","Karthik Guda Vishnu","Alejandro Strachan"],"meta":["March 2020Journal of Applied Physics 127(12):125112","DOI:10.1063/1.5145008"],"references":["329062427_Processing_of_novel_pseudomorphic_Cu-Mo_hierarchies_in_thin_films","320630531_Harnessing_mechanical_instabilities_at_the_nanoscale_to_achieve_ultra-low_stiffness_metals","319128996_Strong_Ductile_and_Thermally_Stable_bcc-Mg_Nanolaminates","313957540_Tracing_the_coupled_atomic_shear_and_shuffle_for_a_cubic_to_a_hexagonal_crystal_transition","301330888_Accelerated_search_for_materials_with_targeted_properties_by_adaptive_design","271851282_A_review_of_shape_memory_alloy_research_applications_and_opportunities","242605562_Phase_transformation_and_precipitation_in_aged_Ti-Ni-Hf_high-temperature_shape_memory_alloys","44693288_General_formulation_of_pressure_and_stress_tensor_for_arbitrary_many-body_interaction_potentials_under_periodic_boundary_conditions","43021115_Full_Tunability_of_Strain_along_the_fcc-bcc_Bain_Path_in_Epitaxial_Films_and_Consequences_for_Magnetic_Properties","8126363_Silicon_Device_Scaling_to_the_Sub-10-nm_Regime","7260495_Combinatorial_search_of_thermoelastic_shape-memory_alloys_with_extremely_small_hysteresis_width","339481748_Tunability_of_martensitic_transformation_in_Mg-Sc_shape_memory_alloys_A_DFT_study","338909907_Uncharacteristic_second_order_martensitic_transformation_in_metals_via_epitaxial_stress_fields","325293275_Tunability_of_martensitic_behavior_through_coherent_nanoprecipitates_and_other_nanostructures","322135063_Martensitic_Transformation_in_a_b-Type_Mg-Sc_Alloy","305767373_P-phase_precipitation_and_its_effect_on_martensitic_transformation_in_NiPtTi_shape_memory_alloys","305689218_A_Lightweight_Shape-Memory_Magnesium_Alloy","301881040_Robust_Structural_Identification_via_Polyhedral_Template_Matching","277977846_Ultralow-Fatigue_Shape_Memory_Alloy_Films","260313604_Role_of_atomic_variability_and_mechanical_constraints_on_the_martensitic_phase_transformation_of_a_model_disordered_shape_memory_alloy_via_molecular_dynamics","257973826_Shape_memory_metamaterials_with_tunable_thermo-mechanical_response_via_hetero-epitaxial_integration_A_molecular_dynamics_study","257543077_Characterization_of_the_microstructure_and_mechanical_properties_of_a_503Ni-297Ti-20Hf_shape_memory_alloy","255916038_DREIDING_A_generic_force_field_for_molecular_simulations","251350818_The_potential_of_atomistic_simulations_and_the_knowledgebase_of_interatomic_models","248474989_Physical_Metallurgy_of_Ti-Ni-Based_Shape_Memory_Alloys","235482634_Calculation_of_the_lattice_constant_of_solids_with_semilocal_functionals","230994552_Heteroepitaxial_integration_of_metallic_nanowires_Transition_from_coherent_to_defective_interfaces_via_molecular_dynamics","229085177_Visualization_and_Analysis_of_Atomistic_Simulation_Data_with_OVITO_-_the_Open_Visualization_Tool","228531650_Identification_of_Quaternary_Shape_Memory_Alloys_with_Near-Zero_Thermal_Hysteresis_and_Unprecedented_Functional_Stability","226051434_An_effective_interaction_potential_model_for_the_shape_memory_alloy_AuCd","223747073_Ni4Ti3-precipitation_during_aging_of_NiTi_shape_memory_alloys_and_its_influence_on_martensitic_phase_transformations","26651671_Nanoscale_Shape_Memory_Alloys_for_Ultrahigh_Mechanical_Damping","7475576_Crystal_Symmetry_and_the_Reversibility_of_Martensitic_Transformations","6982029_Beyond_Finite-Size_Scaling_in_Solidification_Simulations","2643507_Journal_of_Computational_Physics_vol_117_p_1--19_1_March_1995_Fast_Parallel_Algorithms_for_Short--Range_Molecular_Dynamics","1869025_Nonequilibrium_Equality_for_Free_Energy_Differences"]}
