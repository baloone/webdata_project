{"id":"328757723_Moving_a_Chair_through_a_Door_A_Tutorial_on_Local_Spatial_Reasoning_in_Algorithmic_Robotics","abstract":"Spatial reasoning problems in robotics may be categorised into two types: global and local. A typical problem of the global kind involves determining if a robot can navigate along a specified terrain from one specified (starting) point to another (target) point by means of a suitable path, subject to a variety of constraints. A quintessential example of local spatial reasoning is the determination of whether an object can pass through a specified opening. This paper presents a tutorial on the local spatial reasoning problem of deciding whether a given rigid convex object can pass through a specified convex aperture, and if possible, planning a sequence of motions to accomplish the task, in a computationally efficient manner. The exposition of this material is at the freshman and sophomore undergraduate levels, and is well suited to motivate computer science students in discrete mathematics courses.","authors":["Godfried Toussaint"],"meta":["November 2018IOP Conference Series Materials Science and Engineering 435(1):012043","DOI:10.1088/1757-899X/435/1/012043"],"references":["324467333_The_Width_of_a_Chair","310661373_On_the_separability_of_quadrilaterals_in_the_plane_by_translations_and_rotations","268244948_The_Width_of_a_Chair","263412991_All_convex_polyhedra_can_be_clamped_with_parallel_jaw_grippers","238686688_An_Algorithm_for_Planning_Collision-Free_Paths_Among_Polyhedral_Obstacles","231828022_On_the_mobility_of_bodies_in_Rn","225593942_On_moving_a_sofa_around_a_corner","225432663_On_Seperating_Two_Simple_Polygons_by_a_Single_Translation","224729845_How_to_Move_a_Chair_Through_a_Door","222497325_All_convex_polyhedra_can_be_clamped_with_parallel_jaw_grippers","220122216_Optimum_Grip_of_a_Polygon","220632574_An_optimal_algorithm_to_translate_a_convex_polyhedron_through_a_two-dimensional_convex_window","220453200_Separating_Two_Simple_Polygons_by_a_Sequence_of_Translations","220421366_An_Algorithm_for_Planning_Collision_Free_Paths_Among_Polyhedral_Obstacles","3749674_Caging_planar_objects_with_a_three-finger_one-parameter_gripper"]}
