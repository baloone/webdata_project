{"id":"305401725_Belief_propagation_decoding_of_quantum_channels_by_passing_quantum_messages","abstract":"Belief propagation decoding is ubiquitous in classical error correction and has also been applied to stabilizer-based quantum error correction. The algorithm works by passing messages between nodes of the factor graph associated with the code and enables efficient decoding, in some cases even up to the Shannon capacity of the channel. Here we construct a belief propagation algorithm which passes quantum messages on the factor graph and is capable of decoding the classical-quantum channel with pure state outputs. This gives explicit decoding circuits whose number of gates is quadratic in the blocklength of the code. We also show that this decoder can be modified to work with polar codes for the pure state channel and as part of a polar decoder for transmitting quantum information over the amplitude damping channel. These represent the first explicit polar decoders for non-Pauli channels.","authors":["Joseph M.
