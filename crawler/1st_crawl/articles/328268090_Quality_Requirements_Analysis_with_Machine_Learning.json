{"id":"328268090_Quality_Requirements_Analysis_with_Machine_Learning","abstract":"The significance of programming quality prerequisites is in effect generally perceived, despite the fact that the term is to some degree befuddling. Historically, the term nonfunctional requirements (NFR) has been used longer and quality requirements (QR) was concocted to replace it, avoiding ambiguity that derives from the negative definition with the prefix “non”. But “quality requirements” is sometimes confused with “requirements quality,” which denotes quality of requirements represented as specifications.Machine learning is a field of computer science that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning explores the study of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data","authors":["Rokeya Forhat"],"meta":["October 2018"],"references":[]}
