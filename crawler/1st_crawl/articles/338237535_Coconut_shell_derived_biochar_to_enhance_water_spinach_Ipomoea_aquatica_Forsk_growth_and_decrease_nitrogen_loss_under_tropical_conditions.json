{"id":"338237535_Coconut_shell_derived_biochar_to_enhance_water_spinach_Ipomoea_aquatica_Forsk_growth_and_decrease_nitrogen_loss_under_tropical_conditions","abstract":"Farms usually apply excessive nitrogen (N) fertilizers, especially in a vegetable production system, resulting in severe N leaching loss. Although there have been some reports on the impact of biochar on the N leaching in farmlands, most of them focused on field crops in temperate or subtropical religions. Limited information about N leaching in the tropical vegetable system is available regarding the quantitative data and effective countermeasures. A field experiment was conducted to quantify N leaching in a tropical leafy production system (Ipomoea aquatica Forsk) and to evaluate the effects of coconut shell biochar on N loss and crop growth. The results showed that compared to conventional fertilization with the 240 kg N ha−1 application rate (NPK), biomass yield of water spinach increased by 40.1% under the high biochar application rate of 48 t ha−1 (HBC), which was significantly higher than that of NPK treatment. Moreover, The HBC treatment decreased N leaching by 34.0%, which can be attributed to enhanced crop uptake which increased by 40.3% as compared to NPK treatment. The NH4+/NO3− ratio in leachates was between 0.01 and 0.05. It was concluded that coconut shell derived biochar improved the biomass yields of water spinach and reduced the leaching N loss, which provides a promising amendment in tropical regions.","authors":["Fengliang Zhao","Ganghua Zou","Ying Shan","Ding Zheli"],"meta":["December 2019Scientific Reports 9(1):20291","DOI:10.1038/s41598-019-56663-w"],"references":["331208471_Contemporary_strategies_for_enhancing_nitrogen_retention_and_mitigating_nitrous_oxide_emission_in_agricultural_soils_present_and_future","330819051_Mutual_relationships_of_biochar_and_soil_pH_CEC_and_exchangeable_base_cations_in_a_model_laboratory_experiment","330537633_Does_Fertilizer_Education_Program_Increase_the_Technical_Efficiency_of_Chemical_Fertilizer_Use_Evidence_from_Wheat_Production_in_China","329348303_Sorption_of_ammonium_and_nitrate_to_biochars_is_electrostatic_and_pH-dependent","332073874_A_review_on_biochar_modulated_soil_condition_improvements_and_nutrient_dynamics_concerning_crop_yields_Pathways_to_climate_change_mitigation_and_global_food_security","331205241_Comparison_of_efficacies_of_peanut_shell_biochar_and_biochar-based_compost_on_two_leafy_vegetable_productivity_in_an_infertile_land","330730460_N_and_P_runoff_losses_in_China's_vegetable_production_systems_Loss_characteristics_impact_and_management_practices","330052387_Accumulation_and_leaching_of_nitrate_in_soils_in_wheat-maize_production_in_China","329133795_Aggregate_risk_of_reactive_nitrogen_under_anthropogenic_disturbance_in_the_Pearl_River_Delta_urban_agglomeration","327944505_Estimating_soil_nitrogen_balance_at_regional_scale_in_China's_croplands_from_1984_to_2014"]}
