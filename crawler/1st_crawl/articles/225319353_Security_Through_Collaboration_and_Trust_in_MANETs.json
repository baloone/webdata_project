{"id":"225319353_Security_Through_Collaboration_and_Trust_in_MANETs","abstract":"It is well understood that Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) are extremely susceptible to a variety of attacks, and traditional\nsecurity mechanisms do not work well. Many security schemes have been proposed that depend on cooperation amongst the nodes\nin a MANET for identifying nodes that are exhibiting malicious behaviors such as packet dropping, packet modification, and\npacket misrouting. We argue that in general, this problem can be viewed as an instance of detecting nodes whose behavior is\nan outlier when compared to others. In this paper, we propose a collaborative and trust-based outlier detection algorithm\nthat factors in a nodeâ€™s reputation for MANETs. The algorithm leads to a common outlier view amongst distributed nodes with\na limited communication overhead. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is efficient and accurate.\n\nKeywordsoutlier detection-mobile ad hoc network-security-misbehavior-multi-dimensional trust","authors":["Wenjia Li","James Parker","Anupam Joshi"],"meta":["June 2012Mobile Networks and Applications 15(4):1-11","DOI:10.1007/s11036-010-0243-9"],"references":["228337545_A_Bayesian_game_approach_for_intrusion_detection_in_wireless_ad_hoc_networks","225232120_A_Survey_of_Attacks_and_Countermeasures_in_Mobile_Ad_Hoc_Networks","221456735_Task_delegation_using_experience-based_multi-dimensional_trust","221454482_Rumours_and_Reputation_Evaluating_Multi-Dimensional_Trust_within_a_Decentralised_Reputation_System","221422599_Outlier_Detection_in_Ad_Hoc_Networks_Using_Dempster-Shafer_Theory","221391789_Security_through_Collaboration_in_MANETs","221310818_Online_Outlier_Detection_in_Sensor_Data_Using_Non-Parametric_Models","220907138_A_Comparative_Study_of_Anomaly_Detection_Schemes_in_Network_Intrusion_Detection","220829460_Misbehavior_resilient_multi-path_data_transmission_in_mobile_ad-hoc_networks","220775720_Policy-Based_Malicious_Peer_Detection_in_Ad_Hoc_Networks","220416175_Distributed_Deviation_Detection_in_Sensor_Networks","45870634_In-Network_Outlier_Detection_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","4238125_Unsupervised_Outlier_Detection_in_Time_Series_Data","4194346_Active_collaborations_for_trustworthy_data_management_in_ad_hoc_networks","4100365_Detecting_black-hole_attack_in_mobile_ad_hoc_networks","4080576_SORI_A_secure_and_objective_reputation-based_incentive_scheme_for_ad-hoc_networks","3433085_An_analytical_approach_to_the_study_of_cooperation_in_wireless_ad_hoc_networks","2943041_A_Robust_Reputation_System_for_P2P_and_Mobile_Ad-hoc_Networks","2619498_Mitigating_Routing_Misbehavior_in_Mobile_Ad_Hoc_Networks","2346156_Algorithms_for_Mining_Distance-Based_Outliers_in_Large_Datasets","2302474_Finding_Intensional_Knowledge_of_Distance-Based_Outliers","312894685_Procedures_for_detecting_outlying_observations_in_samples","235049974_Procedure_for_Detecting_Outlying_Observations_in_Samples","224747266_SVM-based_intrusion_detection_system_for_wireless_ad_hoc_networks","224675939_Anomaly_Based_Network_Intrusion_Detection_with_Unsupervised_Outlier_Detection","221628530_Outlier_detection_in_sensor_networks","221212827_Efficient_Algorithms_for_Mining_Outliers_from_Large_Data_Sets","220926472_Ad_hoc-VCG_A_Truthful_and_Cost-Efficient_Routing_Protocol_for_Mobile_Ad_hoc_Networks_with_Selfish_Agents","220829433_A_cooperative_intrusion_detection_system_for_ad_hoc_networks","220829430_A_Specification-based_Intrusion_Detection_System_for_AODV","4220376_Cross-layer_analysis_for_detecting_wireless_misbehavior","3981816_Intrusion_detection_using_mobile_agents_in_wireless_ad_hoc_networks","3435952_Intrusion_Detection_in_Wireless_Ad_Hoc_Networks","2638201_Intrusion_Detection_in_Wireless_Ad-Hoc_Networks","2544294_Ariadne_A_Secure_On-Demand_Routing_Protocol_for_Ad_Hoc_Networks","2364634_Efficient_Algorithms_for_Mining_Outliers_from_Large_Data_Sets"]}
