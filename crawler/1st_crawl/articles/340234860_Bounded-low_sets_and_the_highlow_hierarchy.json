{"id":"340234860_Bounded-low_sets_and_the_highlow_hierarchy","abstract":"Anderson and Csima (Notre Dame J Form Log 55:245–264, 2014) defined a bounded jump operator for bounded-Turing reduction, and studied its basic properties. Anderson et al. (Arch Math Logic 56:507–521, 2017) constructed a low bounded-high set and conjectured that such sets cannot be computably enumerable (c.e. for short). Ng and Yu (Notre Dame J Form Log, to appear) proved that bounded-high c.e. sets are Turing complete, thus answered the conjecture positively. Wu and Wu (Lecture notes in computer science, vol 11436, 647–658. Springer, Cham, 2019) showed that bounded-low sets can be superhigh by constructing a Turing complete bounded-low c.e. set. In this paper, we continue the study of the comparison between the bounded-jump and Turing jump. We show that low c.e. sets are not all bounded-low and that incomplete superhigh c.e. sets can be bounded-low.","authors":["Huishan Wu"],"meta":["November 2020Archive for Mathematical Logic 59(7-8)","DOI:10.1007/s00153-020-00726-7"],"references":["316570682_Bounded_low_and_high_sets","266591162_New_directions_in_computability_and_randomness","265498124_Interactions_of_Computability_and_Randomness","346648276_Recursively_Enumerable_Sets_and_Degrees","340486656_Effective_Domination_and_the_Bounded_Jump","332309581_Bounded_Jump_and_the_HighLow_Hierarchy","239666225_Classical_Recursion_Theory_II","226688856_A_superhigh_diamond_in_the_ce_tt-degrees","220316158_On_very_high_degrees","220315314_Limits_on_jump_inversion_for_strong_reducibilities","45930510_A_Bounded_Jump_for_the_Bounded_Turing_Degrees"]}
