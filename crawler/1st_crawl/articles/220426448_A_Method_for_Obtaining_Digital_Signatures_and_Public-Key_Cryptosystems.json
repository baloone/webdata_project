{"id":"220426448_A_Method_for_Obtaining_Digital_Signatures_and_Public-Key_Cryptosystems","abstract":"An encryption method is presented with the novel property that publicly re- vealing an encryption key does not thereby reveal the corresponding decryption key. This has two important consequences: 1. Couriers or other secure means are not needed to transmit keys, since a message can be enciphered using an encryption key publicly revealed by the intended recipient. Only he can decipher the message, since only he knows the corresponding decryption key. 2. A message can be \\signed\" using a privately held decryption key. Anyone can verify this signature using the corresponding publicly revealed en- cryption key. Signatures cannot be forged, and a signer cannot later deny the validity of his signature. This has obvious applications in \\electronic mail\" and \\electronic funds transfer\" systems. A message is encrypted by representing it as a number M, raising M to a publicly specied","authors":["Ronald Rivest","Adi Shamir","Leonard M.
