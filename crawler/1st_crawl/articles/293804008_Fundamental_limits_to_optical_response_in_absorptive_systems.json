{"id":"293804008_Fundamental_limits_to_optical_response_in_absorptive_systems","abstract":"At visible and infrared frequencies, metals show tantalizing promise for\nstrong subwavelength resonances, but material loss typically dampens the\nresponse. We derive fundamental limits to the optical response of lossy media,\nbounding the largest enhancements possible given intrinsic material losses.\nThrough basic conservation-of-energy principles, we derive limits to per-volume\nabsorption and scattering rates, and to local-density-of-states enhancements\nthat represent the power radiated or expended by a dipole near a material body.\nWe provide examples of structures that approach our limits, and also specific\nfrequency ranges at which common structures fall orders of magnitudes short.\nUnderlying the limits is a simple metric, $|\\chi|^2 / \\operatorname{Im} \\chi$\nfor a material with susceptibility $\\chi$, that enables broad technological\nevaluation of lossy media across optical frequencies.","authors":["Owen Miller","Athanasios Polimeridis","M.
