{"id":"337494867_Eliciting_Computing_Science_Teachers'_PCK_using_the_Content_Representation_Format_Experiences_and_Future_Directions","abstract":"This paper focuses on the Content Representation (CoRe) format as an instrument to elicit teachers’ Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK) in the area of computing education. We discuss several methodological variations in the use of the instrument, originating from previous studies by the authors in which CoRe was applied. As a new example, we report on a recent case study, portraying the PCK of Lithuanian teachers with respect to programming. The variations in the teachers’ articulated PCK appear to reflect their respective backgrounds, as well as various known beliefs on the nature and purpose of programming education. We reflect upon the effects of the methodological variations in the above case studies. Group sessions tend to result in more substantial PCK data than individual elicitations. However, the individual data of the Lithuanian case study,\nobtained in very limited time, appeared surprisingly rich. Our observations give rise to new research questions.","authors":["erik barendsen","Valentina Dagiene","Mara Saeli","Carsten Schulte"],"meta":["January 2014","Conference: ISSEP 2014At: Istanbul, Turkey"],"references":[]}
