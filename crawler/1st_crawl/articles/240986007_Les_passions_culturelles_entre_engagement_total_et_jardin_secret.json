{"id":"240986007_Les_passions_culturelles_entre_engagement_total_et_jardin_secret","abstract":"The ways in which cultural passions are rooted in childhood or adolescence largely explains their forms in adulthood, as well as their role in relation to other dimensions of the individual's social life. Two main models of articulation between cultural passion, professional activity and family life can be distinguished: the \"secret garden\" where passion functions as the medium of an identity \"for oneself\" constructed aside from regular identities; and total engagement, around which the person's entire life appears to revolve.","authors":["Olivier Donnat"],"meta":["February 2009RÃ©seaux 153(1)","DOI:10.3917/res.153.0079"],"references":[]}
