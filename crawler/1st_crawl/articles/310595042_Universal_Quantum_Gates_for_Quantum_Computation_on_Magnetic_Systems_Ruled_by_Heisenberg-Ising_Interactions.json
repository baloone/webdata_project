{"id":"310595042_Universal_Quantum_Gates_for_Quantum_Computation_on_Magnetic_Systems_Ruled_by_Heisenberg-Ising_Interactions","abstract":"The gate version of quantum computation exploits several quantum key resources as superposition and entanglement to reach an outstanding performance. In the way, this theory was constructed adopting certain supposed processes imitating classical computer gates. As for optical as well as magnetic systems, those gates are obtained as quantum evolutions. Despite, in certain cases they are attained as an asymptotic series of evolution effects. The current work exploits the direct sum of the evolution operator on a non-local basis for the driven bipartite Heisenberg-Ising model to construct a set of equivalent universal gates as straight evolutions for this interaction. The prescriptions to get these gates are reported as well as a general procedure to evaluate their performance.","authors":["Francisco Javier Delgado-Cepeda"],"meta":["May 2017Journal of Physics Conference Series 839(1):012014","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/839/1/012014","Projects: SU(2) reduction of multipartite two level systemsQuantum information"],"references":["301879117_Quantum_metrology_with_full_and_fast_quantum_control","267272080_Factorization_of_unitary_matrices_induced_by_3D_anisotropic_Ising_interaction","267153334_Algebraic_and_group_structure_for_bipartite_three_dimensional_anisotropic_Ising_model_on_a_non-local_basis","235472039_Enhanced_the_thermal_Entanglement_in_Anisotropy_XYZ_Heisenberg_Chain","232718322_Decomposition_of_unitary_matrices_and_quantum_gates","266438695_Introduction_to_Quantum_Control_and_Dynamics","238974806_Thermal_entanglement_in_the_two-qubit_Heisenberg_XY_model_under_a_nonuniform_external_magnetic_field","237243628_Quantum_Theory_the_Church-Turing_Principle_and_the_Universal_Quantum_Computer","222475225_History_and_generality_of_the_CS_decomposition","13233155_Experimental_realization_of_any_discrete_unitary_operator"]}
