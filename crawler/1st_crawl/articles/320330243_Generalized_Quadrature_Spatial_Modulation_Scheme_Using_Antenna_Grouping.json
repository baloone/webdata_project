{"id":"320330243_Generalized_Quadrature_Spatial_Modulation_Scheme_Using_Antenna_Grouping","abstract":"This paper presents a novel generalized quadrature spatial modulation (GQSM) transmission scheme using antenna grouping. The proposed GQSM scheme combines QSM and conventional spatial multiplexing (SMux) techniques in order to improve the spectral efficiency (SE) of the system. Analytical and simulation results show that the proposed transmission scheme has minimal losses in terms of the average bit error probability along with the advantage of an increased SE compared with previous SM and QSM schemes. For the case studies, this advantage represents a reduction of up to 81% in terms of the number of required transmit antennas compared with QSM. In addition, a detection architecture based on the ordered successive interference cancellation scheme and the QR decomposition is presented. The proposed QRD-M adaptive algorithm showed a near-maximum-likelihood performance with a complexity reduction of approximately 90%.","authors":["Francisco Ruben Castillo Soria","Joaquin Cortez","Raymundo Ramirez-Gutierrez","Fermín Marcelo Rubén Maciel Barboza"],"meta":["October 2017Etri Journal 39(5):707-717","DOI:10.4218/etrij.17.0117.0162","Project: Multiuser MIMO spatial/index modulation"],"references":["302919648_Generalised_Pre-coding_Aided_Quadrature_Spatial_Modulation","275385691_Quadrature_Spatial_Modulation","224314264_A_Very_Low_Complexity_QRD-M_Algorithm_Based_on_Limited_Tree_Search_for_MIMO_Systems","224233109_Generalised_spatial_modulation","311262757_V-BLAST_An_architecture_for_realizing_very_high_data_rates_over_the_rich-scattering_wireless_channel","304369876_Multiuser_MIMO_Downlink_Transmission_using_Block_Diagonalization_and_Generalized_Spatial_Modulation_Techniques","298725973_Antenna_Selection_Schemes_in_Quadrature_Spatial_Modulation_Systems","276175715_A_Low-Complexity_Near-ML_Differential_Spatial_Modulation_Detector","260668398_Bi-Space_Shift_Keying_Modulation_for_MIMO_Systems","260523836_Cellular_Architecture_and_Key_Technologies_for_5G_Wireless_Communication_Networks"]}
