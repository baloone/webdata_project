{"id":"322797402_Gamification_of_the_work_floor_A_literature_review_of_gamifying_production_and_logistics_operations","abstract":"We review the current body of academic literature concerning gamification of production and logistics. The findings indicate that production execution and control has been addressed most often in the current body of literature, which consists mostly of design research. Objectives and goals, points, achievements, multimedial feedback, metaphorical/fictional representations, and levels and progress are currently most often employed gamification affordances on this field. The research has focused on examining or considering motivation, enjoyment and flow as the main psychological outcomes of gamification in the given context, while individual performance and efficiency are the most commonly examined or suggested behavioral/organizational impacts. Future studies should employ more rigorous study designs and firmly ground the discussions in organization theory.","authors":["Harald Warmelink","Jonna Koivisto","Igor Mayer","Mikko Vesa"],"meta":["January 2018","DOI:10.24251/HICSS.2018.139","Conference: 51st Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - HICSS 2018","Project: Gamification"],"references":["317020432_Gamified_Crowdsourcing_Conceptualization_Literature_Review_and_Future_Agenda","308670095_Computer_Games_and_Organization_Studies","290648567_A_definition_for_gamification_anchoring_gamification_in_the_service_marketing_literature","277288978_The_Lens_of_Intrinsic_Skill_Atoms_A_Method_for_Gameful_Design","271502992_Toward_Meaningful_Engagement_A_Framework_for_Design_and_Research_of_Gamified_Information_Systems","315361841_FROM_INTENDED_STRATEGIES_TO_UNINTENDED_OUTCOMES_THE_IMPACT_OF_CHANGE_RECIPIENT_SENSEMAKING","285106589_Self-determination_theory_and_the_facilitation_of_intrinsic_motivation_social_Schwartz_S_H_1977","281595967_Toward_a_theory_of_social_practice_A_development_in_culturalist_theorizing","274663313_The_Critique_of_Everyday_Life","272103685_Gamification_in_Management_Decisions_Judging_Global_Production_Networks_in_a_Cyber-Physical_Way"]}
