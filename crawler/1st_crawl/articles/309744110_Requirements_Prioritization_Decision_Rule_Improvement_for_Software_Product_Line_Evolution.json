{"id":"309744110_Requirements_Prioritization_Decision_Rule_Improvement_for_Software_Product_Line_Evolution","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a method for managing requirements prioritization decision rules. The method was defined on the basis of our experience where the authors participated as project members; the project developed in-house software development support tools based on a software product line. The method consists of a meta-model and processes for utilizing the meta-model. We analyzed the evolution of core assets in relation to an actual project. Tacit knowledge for prioritizing requirements was extracted, made explicit, and used to define decision rules and processes for applying the rules. These rules and processes were specific to the project. To develop decision rules and processes for applying them in other projects, we generalized the basic concept and defined a method for launching, applying and improving requirements prioritization decision rules.","authors":["Mari Inoki","Takayuki Kitagawa"],"meta":["November 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-981-10-3256-1_3","Conference: Asia Pacific Requirements Engineering Conference"],"references":["303842151_Requirements_Prioritization_Survey_and_Analysis","271923463_Requirements-driven_incremental_adoption_of_variability_management_techniques_and_tools_an_industrial_experience_report","258160404_Evaluating_scenario-based_SPL_requirements_approaches_the_case_for_modularity_stability_and_expressiveness","224132833_Guest_Editors'_Introduction_Successful_Software_Product_Line_Practices","301753150_Evolution_of_Software_Product_Lines","266750166_A_holistic_approach_to_feature_modeling_for_product_line_requirements_engineering","240073483_Kaizen_The_Key_to_Japan''s_Competitive_Success","222498365_An_evaluation_of_methods_for_prioritizing_software_requirements","215835796_Software_Product_Lines"]}
