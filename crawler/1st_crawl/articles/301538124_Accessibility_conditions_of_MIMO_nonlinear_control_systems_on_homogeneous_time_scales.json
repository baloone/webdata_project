{"id":"301538124_Accessibility_conditions_of_MIMO_nonlinear_control_systems_on_homogeneous_time_scales","abstract":"A necessary and sufficient accessibility condition for the set of nonlinear higher order input-output (i/o) delta differential equations is presented. The accessibility definition is based on the concept of an autonomous element that is specified to the multi-input multi-output systems. The condition is presented in terms of the greatest common left divisor of two left differential polynomial matrices associated with the system of the i/o delta-differential equations defined on a homogenous time scale which serves as a model of time and unifies the continuous and discrete time. We associate the subspace H∞ of the vector space of differential one-forms with the considered system. This subspace is invariant with respect to taking delta derivatives. The relation between H∞ and the element of a left free module over the ring of left differential polynomials is presented. The presented accessibility condition provides a basis for system reduction, i.e. for finding the transfer equivalent minimal accessible representation of the set of the i/o equations which is a suitable starting point for constructing an observable and accessible state space realization. Moreover, the condition allows to check the transfer equivalence of nonlinear systems, defined on homogeneous time scales. © 2016, American Institute of Mathematical Sciences.
