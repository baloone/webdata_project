{"id":"335645550_Continuous-Time_Integral_Dynamics_for_a_Class_of_Aggregative_Games_With_Coupling_Constraints","abstract":"We consider continuous-time equilibrium seeking in a class of aggregative games with strongly convex cost functions and affine coupling constraints. We propose simple, semi-decentralized integral dynamics and prove their global asymptotic convergence to a variational generalized aggregative or Nash equilibrium. The proof is based on Lyapunov arguments and invariance techniques for differential inclusions.","authors":["Claudio De Persis","Sergio Grammatico"],"meta":["September 2019IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TAC.2019.2939639"],"references":["333585994_Dynamic_NE_Seeking_for_Multi-Integrator_Networked_Agents_With_Disturbance_Rejection","316784990_A_Passivity-Based_Approach_to_Nash_Equilibrium_Seeking_Over_Networks","301818902_Distributed_Algorithms_for_Aggregative_Games_on_Graphs","346368826_Convex_Analysis","329506201_Continuous-time_integral_dynamics_for_aggregative_game_equilibrium_seeking","327992716_Price_of_anarchy_in_electric_vehicle_charging_control_games_When_Nash_equilibria_achieve_social_welfare","327331718_Stable_Interconnection_of_Continuous-Time_Price-Bidding_Mechanisms_with_Power_Network_Dynamics","323722894_Hybrid_Interconnection_of_Iterative_Bidding_and_Power_Network_Dynamics_for_Frequency_Regulation_and_Optimal_Dispatch","323694620_A_Feedback_Control_Algorithm_to_Steer_Networks_to_a_Cournot-Nash_Equilibrium","322673291_A_distributed_primal-dual_algorithm_for_computation_of_generalized_Nash_equilibria_via_operator_splitting_methods","320150991_Stability_and_robustness_for_saddle-point_dynamics_through_monotone_mappings","317799390_Semi-Decentralized_Nash_Equilibrium_Seeking_in_Aggregative_Games_With_Separable_Coupling_Constraints_and_Non-Differentiable_Cost_Functions","312410971_On_social_optima_of_non-cooperative_mean_field_games","312111853_Aggregative_control_of_large_populations_of_noncooperative_agents","308716470_Dynamic_control_of_agents_playing_aggregative_games","307934576_Distributed_Nash_equilibrium_seeking_for_aggregative_games_with_coupled_constraints","266275309_Projected_Dynamical_Systems_and_Variational_Inequality_with_Applications","236736823_Variational_Analysis","225710196_Generalized_Nash_Equilibrium_Problems","222576897_On_the_equivalence_between_complementarity_systems_projected_systems_and_differential_inclusions","222297259_Best_response_dynamics_in_finite_games_with_additive_aggregation","220133136_Lagrangian_Duality_and_Related_Multiplier_Methods_for_Variational_Inequality_Problems"]}
