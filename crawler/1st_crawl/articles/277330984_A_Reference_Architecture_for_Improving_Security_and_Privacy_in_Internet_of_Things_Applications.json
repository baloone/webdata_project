{"id":"277330984_A_Reference_Architecture_for_Improving_Security_and_Privacy_in_Internet_of_Things_Applications","abstract":"As the promise of the Internet of Things (IoT) materializes in our everyday lives, we are often challenged with a number of concerns regarding the efficacy of the current data privacy solutions that support the pervasive components at play in IoT. The privacy and security concerns surrounding IoT often manifests themselves as a treat to end-user adoption and negatively impacts trust among end-users in these solutions. In this paper, we present a reference software architecture for building cloud-enabled IoT applications in support of collaborative pervasive systems aimed at achieving trustworthiness among end-users in IoT scenarios. We present a case study that leverages this reference architecture to protect sensitive user data in an IoT application implementation and evaluate the response of an end-user study accomplished through a survey.","authors":["Ivor Addo","Sheikh iqbal Ahamed","Stephen S.
