This is \nequally true at the academic and personal levels. In this presentation, we \nexplore the use of the emerging SMN in students’ learning at the College of \nComputer Science and Engineering (CCSE-female branch) at the University of \nHail (UOH) in Saudi Arabia. We pose and try to answer the following \nquestions: Are SMN pedagogically beneficial or harmful? Does the adoption \nof SMN by students have an effective role in enhancing academic levels? In \nwhat follows, we will examine how students use social media sites to learn. \nWe will also study the academic impact of SMN. This s will allow us to \ndevelop and improve the usage of SMN for educational purposes and suggest \nvarious methodological approaches which can be used by university \nstudents. Furthermore we will present new methods and advanced online \nelectronic surveys and statistics based on I-Clouding applications to measure \nthe awareness of SMN’s, frequency of use according to the simplicity and \nrapidity students of SMN in learning and getting information, the influence of \nSMN usage on their academic performance, and their effectiveness in time \nand diffusion of information.","authors":["Houssem Jerbi","Sondess ben aoun"],"meta":["July 2017International Journal of ADVANCED AND APPLIED SCIENCES 4(8):154 - 159","DOI:10.21833/ijaas.2017.08.022"],"references":["304074120_The_Effectiveness_of_WhatsApp_Mobile_Learning_Activities_Guided_by_Activty_Theory_on_Students'_Knowldege_Management","298453067_Using_social_networking_environments_to_support_collaborative_learning_in_a_Chinese_university_class_Interaction_pattern_and_influencing_factors","298334939_The_Social_Media_Affinity_Scale_Implications_For_Education","285924053_Preparing_teachers_to_integrate_Web_20_in_school_practice_Toward_a_framework_for_Pedagogy_20","266475449_Perspectives_on_the_Design_and_Evaluation_of_Adaptive_Web_Based_Learning_Environments","247936322_Teaching_Learning_and_Sharing_How_Today's_Higher_Education_Faculry_Use_Social_Media","242717927_Blackboard_as_the_Learning_Management_System_of_a_Computer_Literacy_Course","240793125_Toward_an_Understanding_of_Why_Students_Contribute_in_Asynchronous_Online_Discussions","230960719_Roles_and_Competencies_for_Distance_Education_Programs_in_Higher_Education_Institutions"]}
