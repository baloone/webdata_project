{"id":"328184868_Genotype-by-Environment-by-Environment_Interactions_in_the_Saccharomyces_cerevisiae_Transcriptomic_Response_to_Alcohols_and_Anaerobiosis","abstract":"Next generation biofuels including longer-chain alcohols such as butanol are attractive as renewable, high-energy fuels. A barrier to microbial production of butanols is the increased toxicity compared to ethanol; however, the cellular targets and microbial defense mechanisms remain poorly understood, especially under anaerobic conditions used frequently in industry. Here we took a comparative approach to understand the response of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to 1-butanol, isobutanol, or ethanol, across three genetic backgrounds of varying tolerance in aerobic and anaerobic conditions. We find that strains have different growth properties and alcohol tolerances with and without oxygen availability, as well as unique and common responses to each of the three alcohols. Our results provide evidence for strain-by-alcohol-by-oxygen interactions that moderate how cells respond to alcohol stress.","authors":["Maria Sardi","Molly Krause","Justin Heilberger","Audrey Gasch"],"meta":["October 2018G3-Genes Genomes Genetics 8(12):g3.200677.2018","DOI:10.1534/g3.118.200677"],"references":["323375474_Genome-wide_association_across_Saccharomyces_cerevisiae_strains_reveals_substantial_variation_in_underlying_gene_requirements_for_toxin_tolerance","313624569_Progress_and_perspectives_on_improving_butanol_tolerance","308480838_Identification_of_gene_knockdown_targets_conferring_enhanced_isobutanol_and_1-butanol_tolerance_to_Saccharomyces_cerevisiae_using_a_tunable_RNAi_screening_approach","307863261_mclust_5_Clustering_Classification_and_Density_Estimation_Using_Gaussian_Finite_Mixture_Models","303534821_Improvement_of_isobutanol_production_in_Saccharomyces_cerevisiae_by_increasing_mitochondrial_import_of_pyruvate_through_mitochondrial_pyruvate_carrier","326743039_Yeast_mitochondria_an_overview_of_mitochondrial_biology_and_the_potential_of_mitochondrial_systems_biology","320397644_Uncovering_the_role_of_branched-chain_amino_acid_transaminases_in_Saccharomyces_cerevisiae_isobutanol_biosynthesis","310588906_Mitochondrial_superoxide_dismutase_and_Yap1p_act_as_a_signaling_module_contributing_to_ethanol_tolerance_of_yeast_Saccharomyces_cerevisiae","305630425_Leveraging_Genetic-Background_Effects_in_Saccharomyces_cerevisiae_To_Improve_Lignocellulosic_Hydrolysate_Tolerance","304008832_Adaptation_to_different_types_of_stress_converge_on_mitochondrial_metabolism"]}
