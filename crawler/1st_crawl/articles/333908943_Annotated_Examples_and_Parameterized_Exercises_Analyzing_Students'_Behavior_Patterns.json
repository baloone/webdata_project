{"id":"333908943_Annotated_Examples_and_Parameterized_Exercises_Analyzing_Students'_Behavior_Patterns","abstract":"Recent studies of student problem-solving behavior have shown stable behavior patterns within student groups. In this work, we study patterns of student behavior in a richer self-organized practice context where student worked with a combination of problems to solve and worked examples to study. We model student behavior in the form of vectors of micro-patterns and examine student behavior stability in various ways via these vectors. To discover and examine global behavior patterns associated with groups of students, we cluster students according to their behavior patterns and evaluate these clusters in accordance with student performance.","authors":["Mehrdad Mirzaei","Shaghayegh Sahebi","Peter Brusilovsky"],"meta":["June 2019","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-23204-7_26","In book: Artificial Intelligence in Education (pp.308-319)"],"references":["333327669_Educational_data_mining_for_discovering_hidden_browsing_patterns_using_non-negative_matrix_factorization","327542303_Mining_User_Trajectories_in_Electronic_Text_Books","285149839_Analyzing_the_Features_of_Learning_Behaviors_of_Students_using_e-Books","283556247_Beyond_Prediction_First_Steps_Toward_Automatic_Intervention_in_MOOC_Student_Stopout","282261185_Motivational_Social_Visualizations_for_Personalized_E-Learning","317012167_Modeling_MOOC_Student_Behavior_With_Two-Layer_Hidden_Markov_Models","314513495_Beyond_Prediction_First_Steps_Toward_Automatic_Intervention_in_MOOC_Student_Stopout","301973709_Mining_Business_Competitiveness_from_User_Visitation_Data","295075075_Transfer_Learning_for_Predictive_Models_in_Massive_Open_Online_Courses","288945826_Divergence_measures_based_on_the_Shannon_entropy"]}
