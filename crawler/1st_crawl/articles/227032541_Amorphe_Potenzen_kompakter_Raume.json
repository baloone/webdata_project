{"id":"227032541_Amorphe_Potenzen_kompakter_Raume","abstract":"A set is amorphous, if it is not a union of two disjoint infinite subsets. The following variants of the Tychonoff product theorem are investigated in the hierarchy of weak choice principles. TA1: An amorphous power of a compactT\n2 space is compact. TA2: An amorphous power of a compactT\n2 space which as a set is wellorderable is compact. In ZF0TA1 is equivalent to the assertion, that amorphous sets are finite. RT is Ramsey's theorem, that every finite colouring of the set ofn-element subsets of an infinite set has an infinite homogeneous subset and PW is Rubin's axiom, that the power set of an ordinal is wellorderable. In ZF0RT+PW implies TA2. Since RT+PW is compatible with the existence of infinite amorphous sets, TA2 does not imply TA1 in ZF0. But TA2 cannot be proved in ZF0 alone. As an application, we prove a theorem of Stone, using a weak wellordering axiomD\n3 (a set is wellorderable, if each of its infinite subsets is structured) together with RT.","authors":["Norbert Brunner"],"meta":["December 1984Archive for Mathematical Logic 24(1):119-135","DOI:10.1007/BF02007144"],"references":["328567009_A_Partition_Theorem","322942671_A_New_Proof_of_the_Tychonoff_Theorem","304910445_On_a_question_of_tarski_and_a_maximal_theorem_of_kurepa","303493043_Los_theorem_and_the_boolean_prime_ideal_theorem_imply_the_axiom_of_choice","302378870_The_Axiom_of_Choice_for_Finite_Sets","291630887_Metamathematical_theorems_equivalent_to_the_prime_ideal_theorems_for_Boolean_algebras","284675999_Paracompactness_and_product_spaces","284540314_Social_Choice_and_Individual_Values","268835540_Lindelof_Raume_und_Auswahlaxiom","268776312_A_geometric_form_of_the_axiom_of_choice"]}
