{"id":"316371398_Fine-Grained_Emotion_Detection_in_Contact_Center_Chat_Utterances","abstract":"Contact center chats are textual conversations involving customers and agents on queries, issues, grievances etc. about products and services. Contact centers conduct periodic analysis of these chats to measure customer satisfaction, of which the chat emotion forms one crucial component. Typically, these measures are performed at chat level. However, retrospective chat-level analysis is not sufficiently actionable for agents as it does not capture the variation in the emotion distribution across the chat. Towards that, we propose two novel weakly supervised approaches for detecting fine-grained emotions in contact center chat utterances in real time. In our first approach, we identify novel contextual and meta features and treat the task of emotion prediction as a sequence labeling problem. In second approach, we propose a neural net based method for emotion prediction in call center chats that does not require extensive feature engineering. We establish the effectiveness of the proposed methods by empirically evaluating them on a real-life contact center chat dataset. We achieve average accuracy of the order 72.6% with our first approach and 74.38% with our second approach respectively.","authors":["Shreshtha Mundra","Anirban Sen","Manjira Sinha","Sandya Mannarswamy"],"meta":["April 2017Lecture Notes in Computer Science","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-57529-2_27","Conference: Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining"],"references":["252117816_UPAR7_A_knowledge-based_system_for_headline_sentiment_tagging","234776483_Evaluation_of_unsupervised_emotion_models_to_textual_affect_recognition","234131319_Efficient_Estimation_of_Word_Representations_in_Vector_Space","221622025_Emotion_Estimation_and_Reasoning_Based_on_Affective_Textual_Interaction","221102290_Recognition_of_Affect_Judgment_and_Appreciation_in_Text","319770439_Efficient_Estimation_of_Word_Representations_in_Vector_Space","301404843_Emotion_Detection_from_text_A_Survey","269935079_Adam_A_Method_for_Stochastic_Optimization","264387673_Are_They_Different_Affect_Feeling_Emotion_Sentiment_and_Opinion_Detection_in_Text","262345714_A_Joint_Prediction_Model_for_Multiple_Emotions_Analysis_in_Sentences","262164241_Unsupervised_Emotion_Detection_from_Text_Using_Semantic_and_Syntactic_Relations","261045403_Synesketch_An_Open_Source_Library_for_Sentence-Based_Emotion_Recognition","248226323_Universal_facial_expressions_of_emotion","228057950_Conditional_Random_Fields_Probabilistic_Models_for_Segmenting_and_Labeling_Sequence_Data","220999486_Learning_to_identify_emotions_in_text","26734640_Weighted_Kappa_-_Nominal_Scale_Agreement_with_Provision_for_Scaled_Disagreement_Or_Partial_Credit","4309780_A_Fast_PageRank_Convergence_Method_based_on_the_Cluster_Prediction","2529190_Conditional_Random_Fields_Probabilistic_Models_for_Segmenting_and_Labeling_Sequence_Data","2518534_Thumbs_up_Sentiment_Classification_Using_Machine_Learning_Techniques"]}
