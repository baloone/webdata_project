{"id":"262272875_1-way_quantum_finite_automata_Strengths_weaknesses_and_generalizations","abstract":"We study 1-way quantum finite automata (QFAs).First, we compare them with their classical counterparts. We show that, if an automaton is required to give the correct answer with a large probability (greater than 7/9), then any 1-way QFAs can be simulated by a 1-way reversible automaton. However, quantum automata giving the correct answer with smaller probabilities are more powerful than reversible automata.Second, we show that 1-way QFAs can be very space-efficient. We construct a 1-way QFA that is exponentially smaller than any equivalent classical (even randomized) finite automaton. We think that this construction may be useful for design of other space-efficient quantum algorithms.Third, we consider several generalizations of 1-way QFAs. Here, our goal is to find a model which is more powerful than 1-way QFAs keeping the quantum part as simple as possible.","authors":["Andris Ambainis","Rusins Freivalds"],"meta":["November 1998","Conference: Proceedings of the 39th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science"],"references":["235334044_Rusins_Freivalds_Probabilistic_Two-Way_Machines","225536438_Probabilistic_two-way_machines","284528176_Finite_Markov_Chains","258306977_Finite_Markov_Chain","235335752_Janis_Kaneps_Rusins_Freivalds_Running_Time_to_Recognize_Nonregular_Languages_by_2-Way_Probabilistic_Automata_ICALP_1991_174-185","228057764_Introduction_To_Automata_Theory_Languages_And_Computation","222437957_A_Lower_Bound_for_Probabilistic_Algorithms_for_Finite_State_Machines","220980146_On_Reversible_Automata","220432484_Inference_of_Reversible_Languages","3770655_A_Lower_Bound_For_Probabilistic_Algorithms_For_Finite_State_Machines"]}
