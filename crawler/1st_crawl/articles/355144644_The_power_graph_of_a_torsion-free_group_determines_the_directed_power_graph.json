{"id":"355144644_The_power_graph_of_a_torsion-free_group_determines_the_directed_power_graph","abstract":"The directed power graph G→(G) of a group G is the simple digraph with vertex set G such that x→y if y is a power of x. The power graph of G, denoted by G(G), is the underlying simple graph.\nIn this paper, for groups G and H, the following is proved. If G has no quasicyclic subgroup Cp∞ which has trivial intersection with every cyclic subgroup K of G such that K⁄≤Cp∞, then G(G)≅G(H) implies G→(G)≅G→(H). In particular, any two torsion-free groups having isomorphic power graphs have isomorphic directed power graphs.","authors":["Samir Zahirović"],"meta":["December 2021Discrete Applied Mathematics 305(3):109-118","DOI:10.1016/j.dam.2021.08.028"],"references":["355058039_The_power_graph_of_a_torsion-free_group_of_nilpotency_class_2","353485986_Recent_developments_on_the_power_graph_of_finite_groups_-_a_survey","352904216_Forbidden_Subgraphs_of_Power_Graphs","340324705_On_the_Connectivity_and_Independence_Number_of_Power_Graphs_of_Groups","322732375_Spectrum_and_L-spectrum_of_the_power_graph_and_its_main_supergraph_for_certain_finite_groups","316679843_The_power_graph_of_a_torsion-free_group","315489401_Vertex_connectivity_of_the_power_graph_of_a_finite_cyclic_group","304805284_Coloring_the_Power_Graph_of_a_Semigroup","301839491_On_the_Structure_of_the_Power_Graph_and_the_Enhanced_Power_Graph_of_a_Group","268071117_On_the_Power_Graph_of_a_Finite_Group","260166157_Power_Graphs_A_Survey","260165794_A_combinatorial_property_and_power_graphs_of_groups","243033424_Power_graphs_and_semigroups_of_matrices","225550021_Undirected_power_graphs_of_semigroups","322932160_The_diameter_of_power_graphs_of_symmetric_groups","322839543_On_the_independence_number_of_the_power_graph_of_a_finite_group","322346834_The_strong_metric_dimension_of_the_power_graph_of_a_finite_group","321447381_Reduced_power_graph_of_a_group","315668283_On_connectedness_of_power_graphs_of_finite_groups","265210215_The_structure_and_metric_dimension_of_the_power_graph_of_a_finite_group","243020936_Directed_Graphs_and_Combinatorial_Properties_of_Semigroups","220190865_The_power_graph_of_a_finite_group_II"]}
