{"id":"259254428_A_Two-Stage_Framework_for_3D_Face_Reconstruction_from_RGBD_Images","abstract":"This paper proposes a new approach for 3D face reconstruction with RGBD images from an inexpensive commodity sensor. The challenges we face are: 1) substantial random noise and corruption are present in low-resolution depth maps; and 2) there is high degree of variability in pose and face expression. We develop a novel two-stage algorithm that effectively maps low-quality depth maps to realistic face models. Each stage is targeted toward a certain type of noise. The first stage extracts sparse errors from depth patches through the data-driven local sparse coding, while the second stage smooths noise on the boundaries between patches and reconstructs the global shape by combining local shapes using our template-based surface refinement. Our approach does not require any markers or user interaction. We perform quantitative and qualitative evaluations on both synthetic and real test sets. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is able to produce high-resolution 3D face models with high accuracy, even if inputs are of low quality, and have large variations in viewpoint and face expression.","authors":["Kangkan Wang","Xianwang Wang","Zhigeng Pan","Kai Liu"],"meta":["December 2013IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","DOI:10.1109/TPAMI.2013.235","SourcePubMed"],"references":["242070946_3D_Constrained_Local_Model_for_rigid_and_non-rigid_facial_tracking","232640701_Reconstructing_sharply_folding_surfaces_A_convex_formulation_PDF","310480154_Optimal_step_nonrigid_ICP_algorithms_for_surface_registration","284041529_Spacetime_faces_High_resolution_capture_for_modeling_and_animation","280786567_Deformation_transfer_for_triangle_meshe","279615621_Spacetime_Faces_High-Resolution_Capture_forModeling_and_Animation","265562831_A_survey_of_the_statistical_theory_of_shape","262163115_Active_Appearance_Models","260732656_Robust_Simultaneous_3D_Registration_via_Rank_Minimization","228855445_An_interior-point_method_for_large-scale_L1-regularized_logistic_regression"]}
