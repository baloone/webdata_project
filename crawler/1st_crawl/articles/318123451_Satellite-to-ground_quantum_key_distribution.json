{"id":"318123451_Satellite-to-ground_quantum_key_distribution","abstract":"Quantum key distribution (QKD) uses individual light quanta in quantum superposition states to guarantee unconditional communication security between distant parties. In practice, the achievable distance for QKD has been limited to a few hundred kilometers, due to the channel loss of fibers or terrestrial free space that exponentially reduced the photon rate. Satellite-based QKD promises to establish a global-scale quantum network by exploiting the negligible photon loss and decoherence in the empty out space. Here, we develop and launch a low-Earth-orbit satellite to implement decoy-state QKD with over kHz key rate from the satellite to ground over a distance up to 1200 km, which is up to 20 orders of magnitudes more efficient than that expected using an optical fiber (with 0.2 dB/km loss) of the same length. The establishment of a reliable and efficient space-to-ground link for faithful quantum state transmission constitutes a key milestone for global-scale quantum networks.","authors":["Liao Shengkai","Wen-Qi Cai","Weiyue Liu","Liang Zhang"],"meta":["July 2017Nature 549(7670)","DOI:10.1038/nature23655","Project: Quantum Science Satellite"],"references":["311222313_Ground_test_of_satellite_constellation_based_quantum_communication","304271794_Measurement_device_independent_quantum_key_distribution_over_404_km_optical_fibre","304244952_An_efficient_quantum_light-matter_interface_with_sub-second_lifetime","263163502_Experimental_Satellite_Quantum_Communications","257535107_Experimental_Single-Photon_Transmission_from_Satellite_to_Earth","244990056_Finite-key_analysis_for_measurement-device-independent_quantum_key_distribution","236328092_Heralded_entanglement_between_solid-state_qubits_separated_by_three_metres","232752416_Entanglement-based_quantum_communication_over_144_km","232718669_Direct_and_full-scale_experimental_verifications_towards_ground-satellite_quantum_key_distribution","230804528_Quantum_teleportation_over_143_kilometres_using_active_feed-forward","230638093_Quantum_teleportation_and_entanglement_distribution_over_100-kilometre_free-space_channels","228109483_WITHDRAWN_Quantum_cryptography_Public_key_distribution_and_coin_tossing","224005167_An_Elementary_Quantum_Network_of_Single_Atoms_in_Optical_Cavities","49720029_Metropolitan_all-pass_and_inter-city_quantum_communication_network","45856831_Quantum_repeaters_based_on_atomic_ensembles_and_linear_optics","23222626_Experimental_demonstration_of_a_BDCZ_quantum_repeater_node","13235592_''Event-ready-detectors''_Bell_experiment_via_entanglement_swapping","12330710_Limitations_on_Practical_Quantum_Cryptography","7837732_Experimental_Free-Space_Distribution_of_Entangled_Photon_Pairs_Over_13_km_Towards_Satellite-Based_Global_Quantum_Communication","7670797_Decoy_State_Quantum_Key_Distribution","318669563_Long-distance_free-space_quantum_key_distribution_in_daylight_towards_inter-satellite_communication","312685417_Entanglement-based_quantum_communication_over_144_km","258806971_Air-to-ground_quantum_communication","258093563_Experimental_Entanglement_Swapping_Entangling_Photons_That_Never_Interacted","234790348_Experimental_quantum_cryptography_the_dawn_of_a_new_era_for_quantum_cryptography_the_experimental_prototype_is_working","233835323_Quantum_Repeaters_The_Role_of_Imperfect_Local_Operations_in_Quantum_Communication","231092716_Ground_to_satellite_secure_key_exchange_using_quantum_cryptography","228109669_A_Single_Quantum_Cannot_be_Cloned","200034020_Communication_Theory_of_Secrecy_Systems","24017312_Decoy-state_quantum_key_distribution_with_both_source_errors_and_statistical_fluctuations","13771413_Communication_theory_of_secrecy_systems_1945","13228106_Purification_of_Noisy_Entanglement_and_Faithful_Teleportation_via_Noisy_Channels","11635346_Long-distance_quantum_communication_with_atomic_ensembles_and_linear_optics","10747142_Experimental_entanglement_purification_of_arbitrary_unknown_states","7670796_Beating_the_Photon-Number-Splitting_Attack_in_Practical_Quantum_Cryptography","6409030_Functional_Quantum_Nodes_for_Entanglement_Distribution_over_Scalable_Quantum_Networks"]}
