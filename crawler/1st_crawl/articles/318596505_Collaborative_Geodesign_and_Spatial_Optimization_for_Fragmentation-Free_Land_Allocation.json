{"id":"318596505_Collaborative_Geodesign_and_Spatial_Optimization_for_Fragmentation-Free_Land_Allocation","abstract":"Demand for agricultural food production is projected to increase dramatically in the coming decades, putting at risk our clean water supply and prospects for sustainable development. Fragmentation-free land allocation (FF-LA) aims to improve returns on ecosystem services by determining both space partitioning of a study area and choice of land-use/land-cover management practice (LMP) for each partition under a budget constraint. In the context of large-scale industrialized food production, fragmentation (e.g., tiny LMP patches) discourages the use of modern farm equipment (e.g., 10- to 20-m-wide combine harvesters) and must be avoided in the allocation. FF-LA is a computationally challenging NP-hard problem. We introduce three frameworks for land allocation planning, namely collaborative geodesign, spatial optimization and a hybrid model of the two, to help stakeholders resolve the dilemma between increasing food production capacity and improving water quality. A detailed case study is carried out at the Seven Mile Creek watershed in the midwestern US. The results show the challenges of generating near-optimal solutions through collaborative geodesign, and the potential benefits of spatial optimization in assisting the decision-making process.","authors":["Yiqun Xie","Bryan Christopher Runck","Shashi Shekhar","Len Kne"],"meta":["July 2017International Journal of Geo-Information 6(7):226","DOI:10.3390/ijgi6070226","Projects: Spatial decision support for agricultureSpatial optimization"],"references":["304187068_PSOLA_A_Heuristic_Land-Use_Allocation_Model_Using_Patch-Level_Operations_and_Knowledge-Informed_Rules","284705985_Land_Use_Allocation_Based_on_a_Multi-Objective_Artificial_Immune_Optimization_Model_An_Application_in_Anlu_County_China","280254372_Defining_Soil_and_Water_Assessment_Tool_SWAT_Hydrologic_Response_Units_HRUs_by_Field_Boundaries","257431870_Coarse-grained_parallel_genetic_algorithm_applied_to_a_vector_based_land_use_allocation_optimization_problem_The_case_study_of_Tongzhou_Newtown_Beijing_China","255961873_Identifying_Critical_Agricultural_Areas_with_Three-Meter_LiDAR_Elevation_Data_for_Precision_Conservation","304336759_Collaborative_Geodesign_to_advance_multifunctional_landscapes","284232679_Simulating_multi-objective_land_use_optimization_allocation_using_Multi-agent_system-A_case_study_in_Changsha_China","279392688_The_Multiple-Choice_Knapsack_Problem","265967515_A_land-use_spatial_optimization_model_based_on_genetic_optimization_and_game_theory","240382427_Scenarios_of_Central_European_land_fragmentation"]}
