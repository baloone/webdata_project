{"id":"263784897_Do_MOOCs_need_a_Special_Instructional_Design","abstract":"MOOCs (as an acronym for Massive Open Online Courses) meanwhile engage universities not only in the USA but also in Europe. Currently one of the main questions that come along with MOOCs is if they do have an additional didactic benefit and if so how this benefit can be achieved. This paper therefore deals with the analysis of instructional design models and traditional learning theories with regard to their influence on the designing process of MOOCs. These analyses are enriched by initial experiences with providing the first Austrian MOOC offered at the first Austrian MOOC-platform. From these considerations results a pedagogical guideline for the practical development of MOOCs.","authors":["Elke HÃ¶fler","Michael Kopp"],"meta":["July 2014","Conference: EDULEARN14At: Barcelona","Project: Massive Open Online Course (MOOCs)"],"references":["280298255_The_concept_of_openness_behind_c_and_x-MOOCs_Massive_Open_Online_Courses","271841177_MOOCs_Expectations_and_reality","261949012_How_to_MOOC_-_A_pedagogical_guideline_for_practitioners","239608003_MOOC_Design_Principles_A_Pedagogical_Approach_from_the_Learner's_Perspective","227988899_Instructional_Design_107","345681971_Ways_of_Learning_Learning_Theories_for_the_Classroom","251272719_A_history_of_instructional_design_and_technology_Part_II_A_history_of_instructional_design","234607707_Constructivism_Theory_Perspectives_and_Practice","225552234_A_history_of_instructional_design_and_technology_Part_I_A_history_of_instructional_media","220017733_Connectivism_A_Learning_Theory_for_the_Digital_Age"]}
