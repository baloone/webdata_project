{"id":"221449140_Formalizing_fuzzy_spatial_data_model_for_integrating_heterogeneous_spatial_data","abstract":"The geospatial information is becoming a major input for various decision making processes. The heterogeneity in the spatial data sets, usually collectd and maintained by diverse organizations in their proprietary formats, posses a serious challenge for the integration process. Thus, the first step in this integration process is to develop a standardize geospatial data model from the individual data models. Then the model needs to be encoded in standard schema (GML) and the spatial web services need to be instantiated. Typically, an Enterprise-GIS (E-GIS) framework incorporates the OGC compliant geospatial web services for integration of heterogeneous spatial data sets. Further, the fuzziness exists in the properties of the geospatial objects and their relationships. Thus, there is a need to incorporate the fuzzy characteristics in the data model (application schema) of the E-GIS framework. The present work proposes a fuzzy geospatial data modeling technique for generation of fuzzy application schema. An approach for formalizing the fuzzy model using description logic has also been attempted. The formalization facilitate automated schema mapping required for the integration process. The efficacy of the proposed methodology has been demonstrated with help of an example.","authors":["Indira Mukherjee","Soumya K.
