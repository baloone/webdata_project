{"id":"264859668_A_multi-tree_extension_of_the_Transition-based_RRT_Application_to_ordering-and-pathfinding_problems_in_continuous_cost_spaces","abstract":"The Transition-based RRT (T-RRT) is a variant of RRT developed for path planning on a continuous cost space, i.e. a configuration space featuring a continuous cost function. It has been used to solve complex, high-dimensional problems in robotics and structural biology. In this paper, we propose a multiple-tree variant of T-RRT, named Multi-T-RRT. It is especially useful to solve ordering-and-pathfinding problems, i.e. to compute a path going through several unordered waypoints. Using the Multi-T-RRT, such problems can be solved from a purely geometrical perspective, without having to use a symbolic task planner. We evaluate the Multi-T-RRT on several path planning problems and compare it to other path planners. Finally, we apply the Multi-T-RRT to a concrete industrial inspection problem involving an aerial robot.","authors":["Didier Devaurs","Thierry Siméon","Juan Cortés"],"meta":["September 2014","DOI:10.13140/RG.2.1.1210.3523","Conference: IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)At: Chicago"],"references":["314356976_Efficient_sampling-based_approaches_to_optimal_path_planning_in_complex_cost_spaces","266280365_Integrating_Vehicle_Routing_and_Motion_Planning","236682006_Enhancing_the_Transition-based_RRT_to_deal_with_complex_cost_spaces","225776309_Adaptive_RRTs_for_Validating_Hybrid_Robotic_Control_Systems","224744538_Improving_the_connectivity_of_PRM_roadmaps","261272731_Costmap_planning_in_high_dimensional_configuration_spaces","247933066_Sampling-based_Algorithms_for_Optimal_Motion_Planning","243134611_Rapidly-Exploring_Random_Trees_Progress_and_Prospects","241632677_Towards_small_asymptotically_near-optimal_roadmaps","239019595_Experiments_on_Geometric_Travelling_Salesman_Heuristics"]}
