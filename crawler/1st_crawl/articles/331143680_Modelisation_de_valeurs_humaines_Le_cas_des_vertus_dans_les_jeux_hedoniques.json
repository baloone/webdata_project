{"id":"331143680_Modelisation_de_valeurs_humaines_Le_cas_des_vertus_dans_les_jeux_hedoniques","abstract":"In many applicative contexts, several autonomous artificial agents must interact, make decision and cooperate in a collective way. In those contexts, an agent must not only take into account ethical criterion to reach its goals but also need to decide how it will cooperate and how it will take the other agents’ goals into account. Thus, in this article, we are interested by modeling a virtue ethics, ie. which aims at supporting a cardinal moral value, for collective formation. To this end, we propose a new model of coalition formation, called deviation hedonic games, where each agent decides which coalition it will form according to a set of atomic behavioral rules. Then we show how those rules can be combined in order to represent a plurality of values. As examples, we model three values – liberty, altruism and hedonism – which allow us to characterize new solution concepts.","authors":["Thibaut VALLÉE","Grégory BONNET","Thibault de Swarte"],"meta":["August 2018","DOI:10.3166/ria.32.519-546"],"references":["304137179_Ethical_Judgment_of_Agents'_Behaviors_in_Multi-Agent_Systems","283876676_Fractional_hedonic_games_Individual_and_group_stability","329017722_Jeux_de_coalitions_hedoniques_a_concepts_de_solution_multiples","324309412_The_Nature_of_Human_Values","313533234_Agreeing_to_differ_Modelling_persuasive_dialogue_between_parties_with_different_values","305389719_On_Justification_Economies_of_Worth","301753012_Modelling_morality_with_prospective_logic","300222699_Modelling_Moral_Reasoning_and_Ethical_Responsibility_with_Logic_Programming","290104766_Towards_Modeling_Morality_Computationally_with_Logic_Programming","289825133_From_Moral_Agents_to_Moral_Factors_The_Structural_Ethics_Approach","271231569_An_Overview_of_the_Schwartz_Theory_of_Basic_Values","283679612_AnalyseconWrmatoire_des_domainesmotivationnels_de_Schwartz_Une_application_au_domaine_des_medias","280062066_Simple_Causes_of_Complexity_in_Hedonic_Games","272087403_Governing_Lethal_Behavior_in_Autonomous_Robots","262273022_On_the_Logical_Foundations_of_Moral_Agency"]}
