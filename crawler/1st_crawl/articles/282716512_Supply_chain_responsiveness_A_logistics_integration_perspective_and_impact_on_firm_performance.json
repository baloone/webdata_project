{"id":"282716512_Supply_chain_responsiveness_A_logistics_integration_perspective_and_impact_on_firm_performance","abstract":"Supply chain responsiveness is the key characteristic of many dominant and dynamic supply chain capabilities viz. agility, robustness and resilience. Only few investigations have been executed for exploring this construct. Further, studies have argued that logistics capabilities need to be integrated at a supply chain for developing supply chain capabilities like supply chain agility. Accordingly, the current investigation aims to explore empirically the influence of dominant logistics capabilities on supply chain responsiveness. Further, the current investigation also explores the impact of supply chain responsiveness on firm performance (operationalised across two dimensions viz. operational performance and relational performance). Data collected from 203 logistics and supply chain professionals from Indian manufacturing firms largely support our proposed relationships. Findings largely support the proposed relationships.","authors":["Santanu Mandal"],"meta":["January 2015International Journal of Applied Management Science 7(3):244-268","DOI:10.1504/IJAMS.2015.071147"],"references":["284046901_The_effects_of_logistics_capabilities_and_strategy_on_firm_performance","275246459_Fit_Failure_and_The_Hall_of_Fame","259557595_Mitigation_Processes_-_Antecedents_for_Building_Supply_Chain_Resilience_Capabilities","250019137_Agile_Manufacturing_Enablers_and_an_Implementation_Framework","242053965_Configurations_for_logistics_co-ordination_A_survey_of_Italian_grocery_firms","239044290_Supply_chain_risk_in_an_uncertain_global_supply_chain_environment","236852636_Information_Sharing_and_Supply_Chain_Performance_The_Role_of_Connectivity_and_Willingness","235277869_An_Integrated_Model_for_the_Design_of_Agile_Supply_Chains","235266462_Leveraging_Closed-Loop_Orientation_and_Leadership_for_Environmental_Sustainability","235250834_A_Balanced_Approach_to_Building_Agile_Supply_Chains","233248883_Logistics_capabilities_for_sustainable_competitive_advantage","229708340_The_Effects_of_Logistics_Capabilities_on_Firm_Performance","228806675_The_Role_of_Trust_and_Relationship_Structure_in_Improving_Supply_Chain_Responsiveness","271991373_Measurement_and_optimization_of_supply_chain_responsiveness","271891593_A_relational_study_of_supply_chain_agility_competitiveness_and_business_performance_in_the_oil_and_gas_industry","265869379_Antecedents_and_Consequences_of_Integrating_Logistics_Capabilities_across_the_Supply_Chain","263492905_Understanding_the_Role_of_Logistics_Capabilities_in_Achieving_Supply_Chain_Agility_A_Systematic_Literature_Review","263287625_Examining_the_role_of_stakeholder_pressure_and_knowledge_management_on_supply_chain_risk_and_demand_responsiveness","261029500_A_Contingent_Resource-Based_Perspective_of_Supply_Chain_Resilience_and_Robustness","257222582_Willingness_to_share_information_in_a_supply_chain_A_partnership-data-process_perspective","247171049_Japanese_production_management_An_evolution_-_With_mixed_success","247171045_The_globalization_of_operations_in_Eastern_and_Western_countries_Unpacking_the_relationship_between_national_and_organizational_culture_and_its_impact_on_manufacturing_performance","242343483_Time-based_management_of_technology_A_taxonomic_integration_of_tactical_and_strategic_roles","242336667_Toward_a_Unified_Theory_of_Logistics","241963340_Information_Technology_Influences_on_World_Class_Logistics_Capability","235323298_Aligning_product_design_with_the_supply_chain_A_case_study","235322742_Supply_chain_information-sharing_Benchmarking_a_proven_path","235314456_The_nature_of_an_operations_strategy_Combining_strategic_decisions_from_the_resource-based_and_market-driven_viewpoints","235295202_Supply_chain_resilience_in_the_global_financial_crisis_An_empirical_study","235265190_Performance_assessment_framework_for_supply_chain_partnership","229866727_A_Dynamic_Collaboration_Capability_as_a_Source_of_Competitive_Advantage","229290153_The_Antecedents_of_Supply_Chain_Agility_of_a_Firm_Scale_Development_and_Model_Testing","228118687_What_Are_Dynamic_Capabilities_and_Are_They_a_Useful_Construct_in_Strategic_Management","227918334_Lean_Launch_Managing_Product_Introduction_Risk_Through_Response-Based_Logistics","222502754_Enabling_technologies_of_agile_manufacturing_and_its_related_activities_in_Korea","222305904_The_effects_of_task_and_information_asymmetry_on_business_process_redesign","222221979_Effect_of_Service_Supplier_Performance_on_Satisfaction_and_Loyalty_of_Store_Manages_in_the_Fast_Food_Industry","221952823_The_impact_of_information_technology_on_supply_chain_capabilities_and_firm_performance_A_resource-based_view","220635362_A_case_study_of_an_inter-enterprise_workflow-supported_supply_chain_management_system","23691142_Achieving_Supply_Chain_Agility_Through_IT_Integration_and_Flexibility"]}
