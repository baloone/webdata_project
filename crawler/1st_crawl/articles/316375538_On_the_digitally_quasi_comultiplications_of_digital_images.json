{"id":"316375538_On_the_digitally_quasi_comultiplications_of_digital_images","abstract":"In this article we study the digitally quasi comultiplications of the digital wedge products of pointed digital images. After defining a digitally quasi co-H-space and a digital Whitehead product, we develop a method of how to calculate the cardinal number of digital homotopy classes based on the digitally quasi comultiplications of a pointed digital image as a particular case. We also construct a digitally quasi co-H-space as a digital retract of a given digitally quasi co-H-space.","authors":["Dae-Woong Lee"],"meta":["January 2017Filomat 31(7):1875-1892","DOI:10.2298/FIL1707875L"],"references":["314981629_Comultiplication_structures_for_awedge_of_spheres","267467859_Algebraic_Structures_Based_on_a_Classifying_Space_of_a_Compact_Lie_Group","238720697_Homotopy_Properties_of_SphereLike_Digital_Images","226706651_Properties_of_Digital_Homotopy","284953931_Co-H-spaces","257014893_Homological_optimality_in_Discrete_Morse_Theory_through_chain_homotopies","247040843_On_the_Homotopy_Groups_of_the_Union_of_Spheres","244456262_Composition_methods_in_homotopy_groups_of_spheres","242471712_Algebraic_Topology_An_Introduction","238852710_Properties_of_comultiplications_on_a_wedge_of_spheres"]}
