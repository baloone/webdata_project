{"id":"3331371_Improving_the_efficacy_of_electrical_stimulation-induced_leg_cycle_ergometry_An_analysis_based_on_a_dynamic_musculoskeletal_model","abstract":"To improve the design and increase the effectiveness of electrical\nstimulation-induced leg cycle ergometry, it is necessary to have a\nbetter understanding of the factors that influence the force production\ncapabilities of the stimulated muscles, the ability of the muscles to\nproduce the desired movement, and the metabolic demands of the\ncontractions. A dynamic musculoskeletal model capable of simulating a\nspinal cord injured (SCI) person exercising on a stimulation-powered leg\ncycle ergometer was developed to explore these issues. This model was\nused to address the concern whether performance can be improved by\nchanging seat configuration, the loading, or the intermuscle stimulation\npattern. Performance was assessed in terms of the probability that a\ngiven SCI subject would be able to maintain a steady cadence, the\nrelative strength required by each muscle group to pedal alone, and the\nestimated rate of metabolic energy utilization associated with\nsteady-state pedaling. The authors considered the sensitivity of the\nmodel predictions to intersubject variability. Several strategies are\nsuggested for either minimizing the strength needed to pedal, or\nmaximizing the cardiovascular aerobic exercise","authors":["Lisa M. Schutte","Mary M Rodgers","Felix E.
