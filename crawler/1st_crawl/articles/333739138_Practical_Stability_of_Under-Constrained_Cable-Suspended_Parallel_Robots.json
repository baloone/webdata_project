{"id":"333739138_Practical_Stability_of_Under-Constrained_Cable-Suspended_Parallel_Robots","abstract":"This paper, motivated by the development of a novel gait rehabilitation system, presents a mechanical approach for the dynamic modelling and analysis of equilibrium stability of under-constrained cable suspended parallel robots. These types of cable robots exhibit interesting characteristics of self-motion in the Jacobian null-space. Modelling and understanding of this motion is essential for their applications. It is demonstrated that both a wrench consistency test and proof of stability conditions, derived for real robots with a pulley mechanism, play a crucial role for practical equilibrium stability assessment. Thereby dynamic simulation of the null-space motion help to analyse robustness of the equilibrium against perturbations. Several examples with a 4-4 type robots illustrate the theoretical analysis.","authors":["Dragoljub Surdilovic","Jelena Radojicic"],"meta":["June 2019","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-20751-9_8","In book: Cable-Driven Parallel Robots (pp.85-98)"],"references":["290976918_Kinematic_analysis_of_cable-driven_parallel_mechanisms_based_on_minimum_potential_energy_principle","279188935_On_the_robustness_of_cable_configurations_of_suspended_cable-driven_parallel_robots","259194594_Influence_of_Pulley_Kinematics_on_Cable-Driven_Parallel_Robots","257634726_Computing_the_lowest_equilibrium_pose_of_a_cable-suspended_rigid_body","239399331_Review_of_Contemporary_Approaches_for_Constraint_Enforcement_in_Multibody_Systems","228730313_ACROBOTER_A_ceiling_based_crawling_hoisting_and_swinging_service_robot_platform","313868775_Design_Analysis_and_Control_of_Cable-suspended_Parallel_Robots_and_Its_Applications","281909732_Solving_the_direct_geometrico-static_problem_of_underconstrained_cable-driven_parallel_robots_by_interval_analysis","281673750_Direct_Geometrico-static_Problem_of_Underconstrained_Cable-Driven_Parallel_Robots_With_n_Cables","267791383_Direct_Geometrico-Static_Analysis_of_Under-Constrained_Cable-Driven_Parallel_Robots_with_4_Cables","262405778_Planning_and_control_for_cooperative_manipulation_and_transportation_with_aerial_robots","260634708_Merlet_JP_Stability_analysis_of_underconstrained_cable-driven_parallel_robots_IEEE_Trans_Robotics_291_288-296","228762170_Kinematics_and_Statics_of_Cooperative_Multi-Robot_Aerial_Manipulation_With_Cables","227631438_The_NIST_robocrane","225631267_26_STRING-MAN_A_Novel_Wire_Robot_for_Gait_Rehabilitation","222310181_Practical_stability_in_dynamical_systems","220583949_Classification_of_all_self-motions_of_the_original_Stewart-Gough_platform","220122264_Planning_and_Control_for_Cooperative_Manipulation_and_Transportation_with_Aerial_Robots"]}
