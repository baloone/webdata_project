Such a coordinating mechanism in collaborative transportation is a basic skill in groups of social animals. We consider cable-suspended objects transported by a swarm of flying robots and we formulate several hypothesis on the behavior of the overall system which are validated thorough numerical study. In particular, we show that a nonzero internal force reduces to one the number of asymptotically stable equilibria and that the internal force intensity is directly connected to the convergence rate. As such, the internal force represents the cornerstone of a communication-less cooperative manipulation paradigm in swarms of flying robots. We also show how a swarm can achieve a stable transportation despite the imprecise knowledge of the system parameters.","authors":["Chiara Gabellieri","Marco Tognon","Lucia Pallottino","Antonio Franchi"],"meta":["January 2018","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-00533-7_1","In book: Swarm Intelligence (pp.3-15)"],"references":["323058771_Aerial_Co-Manipulation_With_Cables_The_Role_of_Internal_Force_for_Equilibria_Stability_and_Passivity","318693968_6D_physical_interaction_with_a_fully_actuated_aerial_robot","315769256_Dynamic_Collaboration_without_Communication_Vision-Based_Cable-Suspended_Load_Transport_with_Two_Quadrotors","314584837_Dynamics_Control_and_Planning_for_Cooperative_Manipulation_of_Payloads_Suspended_by_Cables_from_Multiple_Quadrotor_Robots","311648479_Collaborative_Object_Transportation_Using_MAVs_via_Passive_Force_Control","310829525_Motion_Planning_for_6-D_Manipulation_with_Aerial_Towed-cable_Systems","308669780_Force-Amplifying_N-robot_Transport_System_Force-ANTS_for_cooperative_planar_manipulation_without_communication","311755084_Design_modeling_and_control_of_omni-directional_aerial_robot","311754617_Cooperative_transportation_of_a_payload_using_quadrotors_A_reconfigurable_cable-driven_parallel_robot","303886125_Design_modeling_and_control_of_an_omni-directional_aerial_vehicle","281777025_Aerial_Tool_Operation_System_using_Quadrotors_as_Rotating_Thrust_Generators","280310678_Modeling_Control_and_Design_Optimization_for_a_Fully-actuated_Hexarotor_Aerial_Vehicle_with_Tilted_Propellers","283229899_Geometric_control_of_multiple_quadrotors_transporting_a_rigid-body_load","281673750_Direct_Geometrico-static_Problem_of_Underconstrained_Cable-Driven_Parallel_Robots_With_n_Cables","262284330_Collective_transport_of_complex_objects_by_simple_robots_theory_and_experiments"]}
