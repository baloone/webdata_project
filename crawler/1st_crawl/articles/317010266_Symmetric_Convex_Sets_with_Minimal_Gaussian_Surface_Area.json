{"id":"317010266_Symmetric_Convex_Sets_with_Minimal_Gaussian_Surface_Area","abstract":"Let $\\Omega\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ have minimal Gaussian surface area among all sets satisfying $\\Omega=-\\Omega$ with fixed Gaussian volume. Let $A=A_{x}$ be the second fundamental form of $\\partial\\Omega$ at $x$, i.e. $A$ is the matrix of first order partial derivatives of the unit normal vector at $x\\in\\partial\\Omega$. For any $x=(x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n+1})\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, let $\\gamma_{n}(x)=(2\\pi)^{-n/2}e^{-(x_{1}^{2}+\\cdots+x_{n+1}^{2})/2}$. Let $\\|A\\|^{2}$ be the sum of the squares of the entries of $A$, and let $\\|A\\|_{2\\to 2}$ denote the $\\ell_{2}$ operator norm of $A$. It is shown that if $\\Omega$ or $\\Omega^{c}$ is convex, and if either $$\\int_{\\partial\\Omega}(\\|A_{x}\\|^{2}-1)\\gamma_{n}(x)dx>0\\qquad\\mbox{or}\\qquad \\int_{\\partial\\Omega}\\Big(\\|A_{x}\\|^{2}-1+2\\sup_{y\\in\\partial\\Omega}\\|A_{y}\\|_{2\\to 2}^{2}\\Big)\\gamma_{n}(x)dx<0,$$ then $\\partial\\Omega$ must be a round cylinder. That is, except for the case that the average value of $\\|A\\|^{2}$ is slightly less than $1$, we resolve the convex case of a question of Barthe from 2001. The main tool is the Colding-Minicozzi theory for Gaussian minimal surfaces, which studies eigenfunctions of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type operator $L= \\Delta-\\langle x,\\nabla \\rangle+\\|A\\|^{2}+1$ associated to the surface $\\partial\\Omega$. A key new ingredient is the use of a randomly chosen degree 2 polynomial in the second variation formula for the Gaussian surface area. Our actual results are a bit more general than the above statement. Also, some of our results hold without the assumption of convexity.","authors":["Steven Heilman"],"meta":["May 2017American Journal of Mathematics 143(1)","DOI:10.1353/ajm.2021.0000"],"references":["318304131_Local_minimality_of_the_ball_for_the_Gaussian_perimeter","271711610_Mean_curvature_flow","265469633_Sharp_dimension_free_quantitative_estimates_for_the_Gaussian_isoperimetric_inequality","263048881_A_Sharp_Lower_Bound_for_the_Entropy_of_Closed_Hypersurfaces_up_to_Dimension_Six","259312513_Uniqueness_of_blowups_and_Lojasiewicz_inequalities","252801050_Generic_mean_curvature_flow_I_Generic_singularities","248382209_A_two-sided_estimate_for_the_Gaussian_noise_stability_deficit","243112012_On_the_first_and_second_variations_of_a_nonlocal_isoperimetric_problem","224927124_The_Round_Sphere_Minimizes_Entropy_among_Closed_Self-Shrinkers","220139104_A_concentration_inequality_for_the_overlap_of_a_vector_on_a_large_set_With_application_to_the_communication_complexity_of_the_Gap-Hamming-Distance_problem","220138499_Optimal_inapproximability_results_for_MAX-CUT_and_other_2-variable_CSPs","45930717_A_Selection_Principle_for_the_Sharp_Quantitative_Isoperimetric_Inequality","38351573_An_isoperimetric_inequality_on_the_discrete_cube_and_an_elementary_proof_of_the_isoperimetric_inequality_in_Gauss_space","324932789_An_Introduction_to_Probability_Theory_and_its_Applications","319770210_Introduction_to_Smooth_Manifolds","305654847_On_the_entropy_of_closed_hypersurfaces_and_singular_self-shrinkers","305267151_Rigidity_theorems_of_l-hypersurfaces","268608520_Analysis_of_Boolean_Functions","266619208_One_dimensional_solutions_of_the_lambda-self_shrinkers","264968350_Semigroup_proofs_of_the_isoperimetric_inequality_in_Euclidean_and_Gauss_space","264906837_Sets_of_Finite_Perimeter_and_Geometric_Variational_Problems_An_Introduction_to_Geometric_Measure_Theory","258234231_Asymptotic_Behavior_for_Singularities_of_the_Mean_Curvature_Flow","252932653_The_Hyperplane_is_the_Only_Stable_Smooth_Solution_to_the_Isoperimetric_Problem_in_Gaussian_Space","248870959_Mean_Curvature_Evolution_of_Entire_Graphs","245793360_Convergence_of_an_algorithm_for_mean_curvature_motion","240747357_Noise_stability_of_functions_with_low_influences_invariance_and_optimality_Extended_Abstract","231981089_An_Isoperimetric_Result_for_the_Gaussian_Measure_and_Unconditional_Sets","226864935_Curvature_Estimates_for_Minimal_Hypersurfaces","226429958_Geometric_bounds_on_the_Ornstein-Uhlenbeck_velocity_process","225540826_Comparison_theorems_for_exit_times","221665162_Robust_Dimension_Free_Isoperimetry_in_Gaussian_Space","220138762_The_Communication_Complexity_of_Gap_Hamming_Distance","45889140_A_Bernstein_Type_Theorem_For_Self-similar_Shrinkers","44480214_Singular_Integrals_and_Differentiability_Properties_of_Functions","38351517_Gaussian_Measures_of_Dilatations_of_Convex_Symmetric_Sets","24165695_New_Maximally_Stable_Gaussian_Partitions_with_Discrete_Applications","3948668_On_the_power_of_unique_2-prover_1-round_games"]}
