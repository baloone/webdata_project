{"id":"319942897_Visualization_in_stylometry_Cluster_analysis_using_networks","abstract":"The aim of this article is to discuss reliability issues of a few visual techniques used in stylometry, and to introduce a new method that enhances the explanatory power of visualization with a procedure of validation inspired by advanced statistical methods. A promising way of extending cluster analysis dendrograms with a self-validating procedure involves producing numerous particular 'snapshots', or dendrograms produced using different input parameters, and combining them all into the form of a consensus tree. Significantly better results, however, can be obtained using a new visualization technique, which combines the idea of nearest neighborhood derived from cluster analysis, the idea of hammering out a clustering consensus from bootstrap consensus trees, with the idea of mapping textual similarities onto a form of a network. Additionally, network analysis seems to be a good solution for large data sets.","authors":["Maciej Eder"],"meta":["April 2017Digital Scholarship in the Humanities 32(1):50-64","DOI:10.1093/llc/fqv061"],"references":["303214441_Gephi_An_Open_Source_Software_for_Exploring_and_Manipulating_Networks","287496515_The_structure_of_syntactic_dependency_networks_Insights_from_recent_advances_in_network_theory","270752766_Do_birds_of_a_feather_really_flock_together_or_how_to_choose_training_samples_for_authorship_attribution","269849152_Psychological_profiling_through_textual_analysis","250900139_Reassessing_authorship_of_the_Book_of_Mormon_using_delta_and_nearest_shrunken_centroid_classification","233759606_Scalability_issues_in_authorship_attribution","230757955_Cross-Genre_Authorship_Verification_Using_Unmasking","227400810_Interpreting_Burrows's_Delta_Geometric_and_Probabilistic_Foundations","225569533_Attacks_and_Cascades_in_Complex_Networks","221297890_Gephi_An_Open_Source_Software_for_Exploring_and_Manipulating_Networks","220433607_Computational_Methods_in_Authorship_Attribution","51114548_Finding_Statistically_Significant_Communities_in_Networks","8911258_APE_Analyses_of_Phylogenetics_and_Evolution_in_R_Language","8464118_Patterns_in_syntactic_dependency_networks","7585508_Structural_Phylogenetics_and_the_Reconstruction_of_Ancient_Language_History","2173609_The_network_of_concepts_in_written_texts","318393858_R_A_Language_and_Environment_for_Statistical_Computing","318393770_R_A_Language_and_Environment_for_Statistical_Computing","317662671_Inference_and_Disputed_Authorship_The_Federalist","313593641_Hierarchical_groupings_to_optimize_an_objective_function","300467970_The_great_mystery_of_the_almost_invisible_translator","299032701_Graphs_maps_trees_-_Abstract_models_for_literary_history_-_2","292324047_Shakespeare_Computers_and_the_Mystery_of_Authorship","278400962_The_Secret_Life_of_Pronouns_What_Our_Words_Say_About_Us","274151528_Does_size_matter_Authorship_attribution_small_samples_big_problem","274151521_Mind_your_corpus_Systematic_errors_in_authorship_attribution","274151518_The_stylistics_and_stylometry_of_collaborative_translation_Woolf's_Night_and_Day_in_Polish","274151458_Epistolary_voices_The_case_of_Elisabeth_Wolff_and_Agatha_Deken","261586391_Cherry_Picking_in_Nontraditional_Authorship_Attribution_Studies","250900351_All_the_Way_Through_Testing_for_Authorship_in_Different_Frequency_Strata","250900140_Non-traditional_Authorship_Attribution_Studies_in_the_Historia_Augusta_Some_Caveats","243763014_Computation_into_Criticism_A_Study_of_Jane_Austen's_Novels_and_an_Experiment_in_Method","240956478_'Delta'_A_Measure_of_Stylistic_Difference_and_a_Guide_to_Likely_Authorship","236753181_Shakespeare_and_Authorship_Studies_in_the_Twenty-First_Century","227989259_Textual_Analysis","220147919_The_State_of_Authorship_Attribution_Studies_Some_Problems_and_Solutions","216301644_Hierarchical_Grouping_to_Optimize_an_Objective_Function","31414329_Multivariate_Analysis_and_the_Study_of_Style_Variation","30945094_Frequent_Collocations_and_Authorial_Style","6768757_Finding_Community_Structure_in_Networks_Using_the_Eigenvectors_of_Matrices"]}
