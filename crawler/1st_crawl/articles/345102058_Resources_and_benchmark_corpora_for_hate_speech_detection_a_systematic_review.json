{"id":"345102058_Resources_and_benchmark_corpora_for_hate_speech_detection_a_systematic_review","abstract":"Hate Speech in social media is a complex phenomenon, whose detection has recently gained significant traction in the Natural Language Processing community, as attested by several recent review works. Annotated corpora and benchmarks are key resources, considering the vast number of supervised approaches that have been proposed. Lexica play an important role as well for the development of hate speech detection systems. In this review, we systematically analyze the resources made available by the community at large, including their development methodology, topical focus, language coverage, and other factors. The results of our analysis highlight a heterogeneous, growing landscape, marked by several issues and venues for improvement.","authors":["Fabio Poletto","Valerio Basile","Manuela Sanguinetti","Cristina Bosco"],"meta":["June 2021Language Resources and Evaluation 55(3):1-47","DOI:10.1007/s10579-020-09502-8"],"references":["345395986_SemEval-2019_Task_6_Identifying_and_Categorizing_Offensive_Language_in_Social_Media_OffensEval","345354339_Detecting_weak_and_strong_Islamophobic_hate_speech_on_social_media","344722263_SemEval-2019_Task_5_Multilingual_Detection_of_Hate_Speech_Against_Immigrants_and_Women_in_Twitter","342293101_Time_of_Your_Hate_The_Challenge_of_Time_in_Hate_Speech_Detection_on_Social_Media","339799850_I_Feel_Offended_Don't_Be_Abusive_ImplicitExplicit_Messages_in_Offensive_and_Abusive_Language","345461239_Hurtlex_A_Multilingual_Lexicon_of_Words_to_Hurt","345446991_Overview_of_the_Evalita_2018_Task_on_Automatic_Misogyny_Identification_AMI","345427032_Overview_of_the_EVALITA_2018_Hate_Speech_Detection_Task","339940598_A_Multilingual_Evaluation_for_Online_Hate_Speech_Detection","339542814_Offensive_Comments_in_the_Brazilian_Web_a_dataset_and_baseline_results"]}
