{"id":"313051161_An_Agentified_Use_of_the_Internet_of_Things","abstract":"The massive use of connected objects and the development of the Internet of Things leads us to ask questions about the way of use and the intelligence of these objects. First, we will present the main lines of Internet of Things research related to the intelligence. Then, we will highlight some situations showing the boundaries of the different axes of research and present the advantage of using the software agent paradigm. Finally, we will our vision of a smart use of connected objects by merging with the concept of software agents to expose directly the functionalities and capacities of the objects through software agents in purpose to be more accountable to the sustainable development.","authors":["Joël Kwan","Yassine Gangat","Payet Denis","Rémy Courdier"],"meta":["December 2016","DOI:10.1109/iThings-GreenCom-CPSCom-SmartData.2016.76","Conference: 2016 IEEE International Conference on Internet of Things (iThings2016)","Project: Agent framework  for smart objects and smart environments"],"references":["283519801_Middlewares_for_Smart_Objects_and_Smart_Environments_Overview_and_Comparison","273413771_Self-adaptive_systems_A_survey_of_current_approaches_research_challenges_and_applications","271426092_Towards_User_Support_in_Ubiquitous_Learning_Systems","268151893_Enhancing_the_Internet_of_Things_IoT_via_the_Concept_of_Agent_of_Things_AoT","285168510_Ambient_Intelligence_A_survery","284627668_La_kenetique_Des_systemes_multi-agents_a_une_science_de_l'interaction","270053027_Developing_pervasive_multi-agent_systems_with_nature-inspired_coordination","267454881_The_Internet_of_Things_vision_Key_features_applications_and_open_issues","262349486_Self-adaptive_Complex_Systems","261450966_Internet_of_Things_as_a_Methodological_Concept"]}
