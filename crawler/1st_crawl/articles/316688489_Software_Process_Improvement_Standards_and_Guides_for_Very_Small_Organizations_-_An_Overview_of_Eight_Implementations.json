{"id":"316688489_Software_Process_Improvement_Standards_and_Guides_for_Very_Small_Organizations_-_An_Overview_of_Eight_Implementations","abstract":"Very small entities (VSEs) — organizations with up to 25 people — are very important to the worldwide economy. The products they develop are often integrated into products made by larger enterprises. However, it has been established that such entities often do not utilize existing best practice standards and frameworks such as ISO/\nIEC/IEEE 12207 software life cycle processes standard. In addition, small organizations do not usually have the expertise to search for and adapt process improvement best practices from many frameworks to their needs. Finally, these organizations are usually also looking for low-cost evaluation or certification schemes that would provide them with visibility. \nTo address their needs, ISO/IEC 29110 software and systems engineering standards and guides have been developed using elements of published standards. A four-stage road map has been developed to support process improvement activities of VSEs. In this paper, we present eight implementations of ISO/IEC 29110 as an exemplar of the potential benefits from the use of this standard.","authors":["Claude Y. Laporte","Rory V.
