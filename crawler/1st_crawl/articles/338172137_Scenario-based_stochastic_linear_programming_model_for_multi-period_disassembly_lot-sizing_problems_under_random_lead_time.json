{"id":"338172137_Scenario-based_stochastic_linear_programming_model_for_multi-period_disassembly_lot-sizing_problems_under_random_lead_time","abstract":"In the last few years, there has been a growing interest in the disassembly scheduling problem to fulfil the demands of individual disassembled parts over a given planning horizon. An analysis of the literature shows that the disassembly lead time is often considered deterministic. Indeed, in real-life systems, this parameter is rarely known and often has uncertain values that can be caused by the complexity of disassembly operation. In this study, a new scenario-based stochastic linear programming model is proposed to deal with a multi-period, single product type and two-level disassembly lot-sizing problem under lead time uncertainty. The demand for each component is known for each time period and the real disassembly lead time of end-of-life product is an independent random discrete variable with a known probability distribution. The proposed model is used to determine the optimal quantity for disassembled end-of-life products in order to minimize the setup cost for end-of-life product and the sum of average inventory holding and backlogging costs for each component, over the planning horizon and all scenarios.","authors":["Ilhem Slama","Oussama Ben-Ammar","Faouzi Masmoudi","Alexandre Dolgui"],"meta":["January 2019IFAC-PapersOnLine 52(13):595-600","DOI:10.1016/j.ifacol.2019.11.224"],"references":["328275728_Reverse_Logistics_Network_Problem_using_simulated_annealing_with_and_without_Priority-algorithm","259844665_A_Multi-Criteria_Decision_Making_Approach_for_Disassembly-to-Order_Systems","319295975_Capacitated_disassembly_scheduling_under_stochastic_yield_and_demand","314751250_Monte_Carlo_Concepts_Algorithms_and_Applications","312463584_Determining_Sample_Size","306073798_Heuristics_for_multi-product_capacitated_disassembly_lot_sizing_with_lost_sales","305923778_Multi-period_disassembly_levelling_and_lot-sizing_for_multiple_product_types_with_parts_commonality","282634942_How_yield_process_misspecification_Affects_the_solution_of_disassemble-to-order_Problems","251547953_A_new_mathematical_model_for_integrating_all_incidence_matrices_in_multi-dimensional_cellular_manufacturing_system","245281273_A_Lagrangean_heuristic_algorithm_for_disassembly_scheduling_with_capacity_constraints"]}
