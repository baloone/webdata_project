{"id":"321893087_Mixed-Initiative_Feature_Engineering_Using_Knowledge_Graphs","abstract":"This paper proposes a mixed-initiative feature engineering approach using explicit knowledge captured in a knowledge graph complemented by a novel interactive visualization method. Using the explicitly captured relations and dependencies between concepts and their properties, feature engineering is enabled in a semi-automatic way. Furthermore, the results (and decisions) obtained throughout the process can be utilized for refining the features and the knowledge graph. Analytical requirements can then be conveniently captured for feature engineering -- enabling integrated semantics-driven data analysis and machine learning.","authors":["Martin Atzmueller","Eric Sternberg"],"meta":["December 2017","DOI:10.1145/3148011.3154473","Conference: the Knowledge Capture Conference"],"references":["318436900_The_knowledge_graph_as_the_default_data_model_for_learning_on_heterogeneous_knowledge","311087586_Feature_Selection_Using_Information_Gain_for_Improved_Structural-Based_Alert_Correlation","274391076_Semantic_Data_Mining_A_Survey_of_Ontology-based_Approaches","254464245_TourViz_Interactive_visualization_of_connection_pathways_in_large_graphs","236735885_Recommending_Environmental_Knowledge_As_Linked_Open_Data_Cloud_Using_Semantic_Machine_Learning","221450577_Subgroup_Mining_for_Interactive_Knowledge_Refinement","321351604_Explanation-aware_feature_selection_using_symbolic_time_series_abstraction_Approaches_and_experiences_in_a_petro-chemical_production_context","311479070_Knowledge_graph_refinement_A_survey_of_approaches_and_evaluation_methods","308042538_Big_data_analytics_for_proactive_industrial_decision_support","301376627_An_Ontology_Design_Pattern_to_Define_Explanations","289707166_Semantic_Web_in_data_mining_and_knowledge_discovery_A_comprehensive_survey","262169678_Detecting_and_exploring_clusters_in_attributed_graphs_A_plugin_for_the_gephi_platform","259634846_Semantic_subgroup_explanations","254006763_Unsupervised_Generation_of_Data_Mining_Features_from_Linked_Open_Data","233926672_YAGO2_A_Spatially_and_Temporally_Enhanced_Knowledge_Base_from_Wikipedia","222705922_DBpedia_-_A_Crystallization_Point_for_the_Web_of_Data","220804084_The_Mining_and_Analysis_Continuum_of_Explaining_Uncovered","220204491_A_Case-Based_Approach_for_Characterization_and_Analysis_of_Subgroup_Patterns","45854744_Community_Detection_in_Graphs","3410886_Graph_Visualization_and_Navigation_in_Information_Visualization_A_Survey"]}
