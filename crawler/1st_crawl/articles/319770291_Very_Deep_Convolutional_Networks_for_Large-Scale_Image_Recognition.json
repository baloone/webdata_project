{"id":"319770291_Very_Deep_Convolutional_Networks_for_Large-Scale_Image_Recognition","abstract":"In this work we investigate the effect of the convolutional network depth on its accuracy in the large-scale image recognition setting. Our main contribution is a thorough evaluation of networks of increasing depth, which shows that a significant improvement on the prior-art configurations can be achieved by pushing the depth to 16-19 weight layers. These findings were the basis of our ImageNet Challenge 2014 submission, where our team secured the first and the second places in the localisation and classification tracks respectively.","authors":["Karen Simonyan","Andrew Zisserman"],"meta":["September 2014","Affiliation: Google Research"],"references":[]}
