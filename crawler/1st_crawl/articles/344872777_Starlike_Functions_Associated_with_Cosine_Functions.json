{"id":"344872777_Starlike_Functions_Associated_with_Cosine_Functions","abstract":"Let S∗cos denote the class of normalized analytic functions f such that zf′(z)f(z)≺cos(z). For this class, we obtain structural formula, inclusion results, differential subordinations and some radii problems such as radius of convexity, radius for the class of Janowski starlike functions and radius for some other subclasses of starlike functions.","authors":["Khadija Bano","Mohsan Raza"],"meta":["September 2020Bulletin of the Iranian Mathematical Society 47(11)","DOI:10.1007/s41980-020-00456-9"],"references":["333663026_Certain_Class_of_Starlike_Functions_Associated_with_Modified_Sigmoid_Function","323187444_Radius_Problems_for_Starlike_Functions_Associated_with_the_Sine_Function","312945036_On_Booth_lemniscate_and_starlike_functions","284712230_Starlike_functions_associated_with_a_cardioid","274367742_A_subclass_of_starlike_functions_associated_with_left-half_of_the_lemniscate_of_Bernoulli","272361571_On_a_Subclass_of_Strongly_Starlike_Functions_Associated_with_Exponential_Function","267137022_Radius_of_convexity_of_some_subclasses_of_strongly_starlike_functions","266516051_On_some_subclass_of_strongly_starlike_functions","245129813_A_unified_treatment_of_some_special_classes_of_functions","232852233_Radius_of_convexity_and_radius_of_starlikeness_for_some_classes_of_analytic_functions","222596297_Conic_regions_and_k-uniform_convexity","51933317_Radii_of_Starlikeness_Associated_with_the_Lemniscate_of_Bernoulli_andthe_Left-Half_Plane","334411489_Majorization_Results_for_Subclasses_of_Starlike_Functions_Based_on_the_Sine_and_Cosine_Functions","284013829_Some_properties_related_to_a_certain_class_of_starlike_functions","223236356_Radii_of_Convexity_and_Strong_Starlikeness_for_Some_Classes_of_Analytic_Functions","38345141_On_the_univalence_of_some_analytic_functions","31003665_Functions_Starlike_and_Convex_of_Order"]}
