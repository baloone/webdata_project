MRI is used along with CT to identify muscle structures and diagnose osteonecrosis due to its superior soft tissue contrast. However, MRI has poor contrast for bone structures. Clearly, it would be helpful if a corresponding CT were available, as bone boundaries are more clearly seen and CT has a standardized (i.e., Hounsfield) unit. Therefore, we aim at MR-to-CT synthesis. While the CycleGAN was successfully applied to unpaired CT and MR images of the head, these images do not have as much variation of intensity pairs as do images in the pelvic region due to the presence of joints and muscles. In this paper, we extended the CycleGAN approach by adding the gradient consistency loss to improve the accuracy at the boundaries. We conducted two experiments. To evaluate image synthesis, we investigated dependency of image synthesis accuracy on (1) the number of training data and (2) incorporation of the gradient consistency loss. To demonstrate the applicability of our method, we also investigated segmentation accuracy on synthesized images.","authors":["Yuta Hiasa","Yoshito Otake","Masaki Takao","Takumi Matsuoka"],"meta":["September 2018","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-00536-8_4","In book: Simulation and Synthesis in Medical Imaging (pp.31-41)","Project: Computational Musculoskeletal Anatomy"],"references":["322060135_Unpaired_Image-to-Image_Translation_Using_Cycle-Consistent_Adversarial_Networks","320966887_Image-to-Image_Translation_with_Conditional_Adversarial_Networks","319583658_Whole_Brain_Segmentation_and_Labeling_from_CT_Using_Synthetic_MR_Images","319460791_Deep_Adversarial_Networks_for_Biomedical_Image_Segmentation_Utilizing_Unannotated_Images","315710637_Unpaired_Image-to-Image_Translation_using_Cycle-Consistent_Adversarial_Networks","310610633_Image-to-Image_Translation_with_Conditional_Adversarial_Networks","310235006_Multi-class_Generative_Adversarial_Networks_with_the_L2_Loss_Function","23447199_Simulation_of_Ground-Truth_Validation_Data_Via_Physically-_and_Statistically-Based_Warps","325516387_Adversarial_synthesis_learning_enables_segmentation_without_target_modality_ground_truth","322334641_Joint_Multimodal_Segmentation_of_Clinical_CT_and_MR_from_Hip_Arthroplasty_Patients","320026610_Deep_MR_to_CT_Synthesis_Using_Unpaired_Data","318017449_Unsupervised_Domain_Adaptation_in_Brain_Lesion_Segmentation_with_Adversarial_Networks","308278061_Perceptual_Losses_for_Real-Time_Style_Transfer_and_Super-Resolution","305193694_U-Net_Convolutional_Networks_for_Biomedical_Image_Segmentation","283208858_Fast_Patch-Based_Pseudo-CT_Synthesis_from_T1-Weighted_MR_Images_for_PETMR_Attenuation_Correction_in_Brain_Studies","224130164_N4ITK_improved_N3_bias_correction","42370280_Musculoskeletal_MRI_segmentation_using_multi-resolution_simplex_meshes_with_medial_representations","13443050_A_comparison_of_similarity_measures_for_use_in_2-D-3-D_medical_image_registration","8951009_MRI_Diagnosis_of_Tears_of_the_Hip_Abductor_Tendons_Gluteus_Medius_and_Gluteus_Minimus"]}
