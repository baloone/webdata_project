For each patient, scan, lobe, and tissue type, we analyzed the averages of mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) in a generalized additive mixed model.\n\nResults: \nTwenty-five patients (mean age 5.9 years; range 0.5-24.5 years) underwent 2 to 6 scans each, totaling 70 scans. Average time between scans was 1.2 years (range 0.4-2.9). Patient scans were compared with those of 73 healthy controls. FA values were lowest, and MD values were highest in tubers, next in perituber tissue, then in NAWM. Longitudinal analysis showed a positive (FA) and negative (MD) correlation with age in tubers, perituber tissue, and NAWM. All 3 tissue types followed a biexponential developmental trajectory, similar to the white matter of controls. An additional qualitative analysis showed a gradual transition of diffusion values across the tissue type boundaries.\n\nConclusions: \nSimilar to NAWM, tuber and perituber tissues in tuberous sclerosis complex undergo microstructural evolution with age. The extent of diffusion abnormality decreases with distance to the tuber, in line with known extension of histologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular abnormalities beyond tuber pathology.","authors":["Jurriaan M Peters","Anna K Prohl","Xavier Tomas-Fernandez","Maxime Taquet"],"meta":["October 2015Neurology 85(18)","DOI:10.1212/WNL.0000000000002055"],"references":["262044806_Tuberous_Sclerosis_Complex_Diagnostic_Criteria_Update_Recommendations_of_the_2012_International_Tuberous_Sclerosis_Complex_Consensus_Conference","260063108_Diffusion_tensor_imaging_and_related_techniques_in_tuberous_sclerosis_complex_Review_and_future_directions","258530619_A_Mathematical_Framework_for_the_Registration_and_Analysis_of_Multi-Fascicle_Models_for_Population_Studies_of_the_Brain_Microstructure","257749917_Predictors_of_seizure-free_outcome_after_epilepsy_surgery_for_pediatric_tuberous_sclerosis_complex","235752976_Tuberous_Sclerosis_Complex_Focus_on_radial_migration_lines","233789824_Parametric_Representation_of_Multiple_White_Matter_Fascicles_from_Cube_and_Sphere_Diffusion_MRI","226341116_The_Autism_Diagnostic_Observation_Schedule-Generic_A_Standard_Measure_of_Social_and_Communication_Deficits_Associated_with_the_Spectrum_of_Autism","225095499_Impaired_Language_Pathways_in_Tuberous_Sclerosis_Complex_Patients_with_Autism_Spectrum_Disorders","42640104_MRI_findings_reveal_three_different_types_of_tubers_in_patients_with_tuberous_sclerosis_complex","11600502_Correlation_of_White_Matter_Diffusivity_and_Anisotropy_with_Age_During_Childhood_and_Adolescence_A_Cross-Sectional_Diffusion-Tensor_MR_Imaging_Study","5951729_Characteristics_of_Abnormal_Diffusivity_in_Normal-Appearing_White_Matter_Investigated_with_Diffusion_Tensor_MR_Imaging_in_Tuberous_Sclerosis_Complex","290977465_Erratum_The_neuroanatomical_phenotype_of_tuberous_sclerosis_complex_Focus_on_radial_migration_linesNeuroradiology_DOI_101007s00234-013-1184-3","271330466_A_Model_of_Population_and_Subject_MOPS_Intensities_With_Application_to_Multiple_Sclerosis_Lesion_Segmentation","265516005_MRI_characteristics_of_cerebellar_tubers_and_their_longitudinal_changes_in_children_with_tuberous_sclerosis_complex","263322560_A_Logarithmic_Opinion_Pool_Based_STAPLE_Algorithm_for_the_Fusion_of_Segmentations_With_Associated_Reliability_Weights","263054068_Early_developmental_trajectories_associated_with_ASD_in_infants_with_tuberous_sclerosis_complex","260151621_Developmental_brain_abnormalities_in_tuberous_sclerosis_complex_A_comparative_tissue_analysis_of_cortical_tubers_and_perituberal_cortex","254044927_Population_intensity_outliers_or_a_new_model_for_brain_WM_abnormalities","254044584_Block-Matching_Strategies_for_Rigid_Registration_of_Multimodal_Medical_Images","236688867_Longitudinal_quantitative_analysis_of_the_tuber-to-brain_proportion_in_patients_with_tuberous_sclerosis_Clinical_article","236437246_Electrocorticographic_evidence_of_perituberal_cortex_epileptogenicity_in_tuberous_sclerosis_complex_Clinical_article","233751093_Intrinsic_epileptogenicity_of_cortical_tubers_revealed_by_intracranial_EEG_monitoring","230810194_MRI_Characterization_and_Longitudinal_Study_of_Focal_Cerebellar_Lesions_in_a_Young_Tuberous_Sclerosis_Cohort","229690706_Epilepsy_Surgery_in_Children_with_Tuberous_Sclerosis_Complex_Presurgical_Evaluation_and_Outcome","221825797_Cytoarchitectural_alterations_are_widespread_in_cerebral_cortex_in_tuberous_sclerosis_complex","221764254_Everolimus_alters_white_matter_diffusion_in_tuberous_sclerosis_complex","51853802_Loss_of_White_Matter_Microstructural_Integrity_Is_Associated_with_Adverse_Neurological_Outcome_in_Tuberous_Sclerosis_Complex","41760625_Diffusion_Tensor_Imaging_of_Commissural_and_Projection_White_Matter_in_Tuberous_Sclerosis_Complex_and_Correlation_with_Tuber_Load","26671723_Magnetic_resonance_imaging_and_diffusion-weighted_imaging_of_normal-appearing_white_matter_in_children_and_young_adults_with_tuberous_sclerosis_complex","24245020_Cyst-like_tubers_are_associated_with_TSC2_and_epilepsy_in_tuberous_sclerosis_complex","23760848_Are_cortical_tubers_epileptogenic_Evidence_from_electrocorticography","23189737_Tuberous_sclerosis","7594205_Diffusion_tensor_imaging_in_children_and_adolescents_with_tuberous_sclerosis","7235785_Diffusion_Tensor_Imaging_and_Tractography_of_Human_Brain_Development","6225099_Local_epileptogenic_networks_in_tuberous_sclerosis_complex_A_case_review","5807094_1_Clinical_DT-MRI_Estimation_Smoothing_and_Fiber_Tracking_with_Log-Euclidean_Metrics","5548746_Molecular_and_diffusion_tensor_imaging_of_epileptic_networks"]}
