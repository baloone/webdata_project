{"id":"228572437_A_new_S-box_structure_named_Affine-Power-Affine","abstract":"In this paper, we consider the problem of the simple algebraic structure of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) S-box, in which only 9 terms are involved in the algebraic expression, while its inverse S-box involves 255 terms. By resolving the reason why the algebraic expressions of AES-like S-boxes are so simple, the upper bound of items involved in the algebraic expressions of AES-like S-boxes is presented. Then, a new S-box structure named Affine-Power-Affine (APA) is designed such that the algebraic complexity is increased. With the APA structure, the algebraic complexity of the improved AES S-box is increased from 9 to 253, and its inverse S-box keeps 255. Furthermore, other good cryptographic characteristics of AES S-box are inherited.","authors":["Lingguo Cui","Yuanda Cao"],"meta":["June 2007International journal of innovative computing, information & control: IJICIC 3(3)"],"references":["297693420_Security_in_heterogeneous_large_scale_environments_using_grid_technology","292411806_Affine_transformation_observation_on_Rijndael_S-box","291645157_Algebraic_expression_for_AES_S-box_and_InvS-box","291117992_Equivalent_generation_of_the_S-box_of_RIJNDAEL","235720528_AES_the_Advanced_Encryption_Standard","228564667_A_block_recursive_algorithm_for_the_linear_complementarity_problem_with_an_M-matrix","225584745_Linear_cryptanalysis_method_for_DES_cipher_III","221355555_Differential_Cryptanalysis_of_DES-like_Cryptosystems","4140746_An_AES_S-box_to_increase_complexity_and_cryptographic_analysis","2544273_Comments_on_the_Security_of_the_AES_and_the_XSL_Technique"]}
