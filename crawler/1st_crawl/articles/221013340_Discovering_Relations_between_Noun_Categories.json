{"id":"221013340_Discovering_Relations_between_Noun_Categories","abstract":"Traditional approaches to Relation Extraction from text require manually defining the relations to be extracted. We propose here an approach to automatically discovering relevant relations, given a large text corpus plus an initial ontology defining hundreds of noun categories (e.g., Athlete, Musician, Instrument). Our approach discovers frequently stated relations between pairs of these categories, using a two step process. For each pair of categories (e.g., Musician and Instrument) it first coclusters the text contexts that connect known instances of the two categories, generating a candidate relation for each resulting cluster. It then applies a trained classifier to determine which of these candidate relations is semantically valid. Our experiments apply this to a text corpus containing approximately 200 million web pages and an ontology containing 122 categories from the NELL system [Carlson et al., 2010b], producing a set of 781 proposed candidate relations, approximately half of which are semantically valid. We conclude this is a useful approach to semi-automatic extension of the ontology for large-scale information extraction systems such as NELL.","authors":["Thahir P Mohamed","Estevam Rafael Hruschka","Tom M.
