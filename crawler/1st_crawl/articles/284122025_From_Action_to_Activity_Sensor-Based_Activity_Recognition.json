{"id":"284122025_From_Action_to_Activity_Sensor-Based_Activity_Recognition","abstract":"As compared to actions, activities are much more complex, but semantically they are more representative of a human's real life. Techniques for action recognition from sensor-generated data are mature. However, few efforts have targeted sensor-based activity recognition. In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm to identify temporal patterns among actions and utilize the identified patterns to represent activities for automated recognition. Experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrated that our approach is able to recognize activities with high accuracy from temporal patterns, and that temporal patterns can be used effectively as a mid-level feature for activity representation.","authors":["Ye Liu","Liqiang Nie","Li Liu","David S.
