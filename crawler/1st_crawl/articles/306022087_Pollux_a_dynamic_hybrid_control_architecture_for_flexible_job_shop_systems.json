{"id":"306022087_Pollux_a_dynamic_hybrid_control_architecture_for_flexible_job_shop_systems","abstract":"Nowadays, manufacturing control systems can respond more effectively to exigent market requirements and real-time demands. Indeed, they take advantage of changing their structural and behavioural arrangements to tailor the control solution from a diverse set of feasible configurations. However, the challenge of this approach is to determine efficient mechanisms that dynamically optimise the configuration between different architectures. This paper presents a dynamic hybrid control architecture that integrates a switching mechanism to control changes at both structural and behavioural level. The switching mechanism is based on a genetic algorithm and strives to find the most suitable operating mode of the architecture with regard to optimality and reactivity. The proposed approach was tested in a real flexible job shop to demonstrate the applicability and efficiency of including an optimisation algorithm in the switching process of a dynamic hybrid control architecture.","authors":["Jose-Fernando Jimenez","Abdelghani Bekrar","Gabriel Zambrano","Damien Trentesaux"],"meta":["August 2016International Journal of Production Research 55(15):1-19","DOI:10.1080/00207543.2016.1218087","Project: Intelligent Manufacturing Systems"],"references":["280888948_Coupling_Predictive_Scheduling_and_Reactive_Control_in_Manufacturing_State_of_the_Art_and_Future_Challenges","265906182_A_product-driven_system_approach_for_multilevel_decisions_in_manufacturing_planning_and_control","262602985_A_Collaborative_Framework_between_a_Scheduling_System_and_a_Holonic_Manufacturing_Execution_System","252569545_Centralized_VERSUS_decentralized_productionplanning","228435533_Centralized_versus_decentralized_production_planning_in_supply_chains","222162834_Hierarchy_in_distributed_shop_floor_control","220706400_Patterns_of_delegate_MAS","301793228_A_switching_mechanism_framework_for_optimal_coupling_of_predictive_scheduling_and_reactive_control_in_manufacturing_hybrid_control_architectures","289381727_A_JADE_Environment_for_Product_Driven_Automation_of_Holonic_Manufacturing","283897291_Governance_mechanism_in_control_architectures_for_flexible_manufacturing_systems","271944967_Switching_mode_control_strategy_in_manufacturing_execution_systems","268526299_Dynamic_self-organization_in_holonic_multi-agent_manufacturing_systems_The_ADACOR_evolution","263764434_Coupling_a_genetic_algorithm_with_the_distributed_arrival-time_control_for_the_JIT_dynamic_scheduling_of_flexible_job-shops","263760402_Risk_modelling_and_assessment_for_distributed_manufacturing_system","260605863_ORCA-FMS_A_dynamic_architecture_for_the_optimized_and_reactive_control_of_flexible_manufacturing_scheduling","260156414_Reducing_myopic_behavior_in_FMS_control_A_semi-heterarchical_simulation-optimization_approach","257356032_The_future_of_operations_management_An_outlook_and_analysis","252019004_An_adaptive_Genetic_Algorithm_for_the_Flexible_Job-shop_Scheduling_Problem","245231501_Schedule_execution_in_autonomic_manufacturing_execution_systems","244436493_NetLogo_Center_for_connected_learning_and_computer-based_modeling","236839280_Benchmarking_Flexible_Job-Shop_Scheduling_and_Control_Systems","230734323_An_effective_potential_field_approach_to_FMS_holonic_heterarchical_control","227420683_Multi-agent-based_transport_planning_in_the_newspaper_industry","223687591_The_evolution_of_control_architectures_for_automated_manufacturing_systems","222936839_A_Survey_of_Factory_Control_Algorithms_That_Can_Be_Implemented_in_a_Multi-Agent_Heterarchy_Dispatching_Scheduling_and_Pull","222639982_Distributed_control_of_production_systems","222414120_ADACOR_A_holonic_architecture_for_agile_and_adaptive_manufacturing_control","215459436_Adaptation_in_Natural_and_Artificial_Systems_An_Introductory_Analysis_With_Applications_to_Biology_Control_and_Artificial_Intelligence","37654062_An_agile_and_adaptive_holonic_architecture_for_manufacturing_control"]}
