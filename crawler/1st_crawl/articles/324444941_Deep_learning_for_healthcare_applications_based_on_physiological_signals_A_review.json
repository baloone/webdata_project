{"id":"324444941_Deep_learning_for_healthcare_applications_based_on_physiological_signals_A_review","abstract":"Background and objective: \nWe have cast the net into the ocean of knowledge to retrieve the latest scientific research on deep learning methods for physiological signals. We found 53 research papers on this topic, published from 01.01.2008 to 31.12.2017.\n\nMethods: \nAn initial bibliometric analysis shows that the reviewed papers focused on Electromyogram(EMG), Electroencephalogram(EEG), Electrocardiogram(ECG), and Electrooculogram(EOG). These four categories were used to structure the subsequent content review.\n\nResults: \nDuring the content review, we understood that deep learning performs better for big and varied datasets than classic analysis and machine classification methods. Deep learning algorithms try to develop the model by using all the available input.\n\nConclusions: \nThis review paper depicts the application of various deep learning algorithms used till recently, but in future it will be used for more healthcare areas to improve the quality of diagnosis.","authors":["Oliver Faust","Yuki Hagiwara","Jen Hong Tan","Shu Lih Oh"],"meta":["April 2018Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine 161","DOI:10.1016/j.cmpb.2018.04.005"],"references":["323689801_Documenting_and_predicting_topic_changes_in_Computers_in_Biology_and_Medicine_A_bibliometric_keyword_analysis_from_1990_to_2017","322213305_Application_of_stacked_convolutional_and_long_short-term_memory_network_for_accurate_identification_of_CAD_ECG_signals","320072603_Deep_convolutional_neural_network_for_the_automated_detection_and_diagnosis_of_seizure_using_EEG_signals","319308461_Automated_identification_of_shockable_and_non-shockable_life-threatening_ventricular_arrhythmias_using_convolutional_neural_network","319271551_A_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Network_Model_to_Classify_Heartbeats","319056221_Recurrent_Neural_Network_Based_Classification_of_ECG_Signal_Features_for_Obstruction_of_Sleep_Apnea_Detection","320968038_Deep_Learning_Human_Mind_for_Automated_Visual_Classification","320638256_EMG-Based_Estimation_of_Limb_Movement_Using_Deep_Learning_With_Recurrent_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","320496710_ECG_Based_Identification_by_Deep_Learning","319770272_Delving_Deep_into_Rectifiers_Surpassing_Human-Level_Performance_on_ImageNet_Classification"]}
