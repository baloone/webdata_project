{"id":"313230990_Case-Based_Reasoning_untuk_Diagnosis_Penyakit_Jantung","abstract":"Case Based Reasoning (CBR) is a computer system that used for reasoning old knowledge to solve new problems. It works by looking at the closest old case to the new case. This research attempts to establish a system of CBR for diagnosing heart disease. The diagnosis process is done by inserting new cases containing symptoms into the system, then the similarity value calculation between cases uses the nearest neighbor method similarity, minkowski distance similarity and euclidean distance similarity.\n\nCase taken is the case with the highest similarity value. If a case does not succeed in the diagnosis or threshold","authors":["Eka Wahyudi","Sri Hartati"],"meta":["January 2017","DOI:10.22146/ijccs.15523"],"references":["264883724_THE_INDUCED_MINKOWSKI_ORDERED_WEIGHTED_AVERAGING_DISTANCE_OPERATOR","225734295_The_Elements_of_Statistical_Learning_Data_Mining_Inference_and_Prediction","285341238_Case-Base_Maintenance","259007010_RespiDiag_A_Case-Based_Reasoning_System_for_the_Diagnosis_of_Chronic_Obstructive_Pulmonary_Disease","220274031_A_comparative_study_on_the_use_of_similarity_measures_in_case-based_reasoning_to_improve_the_classification_of_environmental_system_situations","216300763_The_Elements_of_Statistical_Learning_Data_Mining_Inference_and_Prediction"]}
