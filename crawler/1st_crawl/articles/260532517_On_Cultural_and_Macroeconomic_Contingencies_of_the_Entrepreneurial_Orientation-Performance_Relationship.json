{"id":"260532517_On_Cultural_and_Macroeconomic_Contingencies_of_the_Entrepreneurial_Orientation-Performance_Relationship","abstract":"The relationship between entrepreneurial orientation (EO) and firm performance is among the best-researched topics in entrepreneurship research. These studies have been conducted in various national contexts. While a first meta-analysis by Rauch et al. finds no significant difference between EO's effects based on the continent in which the firm is based, the present study considers how national cultural and macroeconomic drivers impact the EOâ€“performance relationship. Building upon 177 studies with data from 41 countries, the meta-analysis consolidates this literature stream, contributing to the evidence-based entrepreneurship research.","authors":["Saadat Saeed","Shumaila Yousafzai","Andreas Engelen"],"meta":["March 2014Entrepreneurship: Theory and Practice 38(2)","DOI:10.1111/etap.12097"],"references":["315716261_Marketing_Renaissance_How_Research_in_Emerging_Markets_Advances_Marketing_Science_and_Practice","315716109_Make_Buy_or_Ally_A_Transaction_Cost_Theory_Meta-Analysis","345527656_When_Does_Guanxi_Matter_Issues_of_Capitalization_and_Its_Dark_Sides","331501027_Linking_entrepreneurial_orientation_with_the_performance_of_Croatian_hotel_industry","329638324_Reliability_of_Nominal_Data_Based_on_Qualitative_Judgments","329258540_A_Cross-National_Investigation_into_the_Individual_and_National_Cultural_Antecedents_of_Consumer_Innovativeness","315363191_STRATEGIC_PROCESS_EFFECTS_ON_THE_ENTREPRENEURIAL_ORIENTATION-SALES_GROWTH_RATE_RELATIONSHIP","313199364_The_Correlates_of_Entrepreneurship_in_Three_Types_of_Firms","313182290_A_paradigm_for_confirmatory_cultural_research_in_organisational_behavior","310118277_International_studies_of_management_and_organization"]}
