GCSE results at 16y were obtained from national records. Associations between exposures and academic performance (total exam points) were assessed using multilevel mixed-effects linear regression adjusted for mood, BMI z-score, deprivation, sex, season and school; potential interactions were investigated.\nPA was not associated with academic performance. One-hour more accelerometer-assessed SED was associated with (β(95 % CI)) 6·9(1·5,12·4) more GCSE points. An extra hour of screen time was associated with 9.3(-14·3,-4·3) fewer points whereas an extra hour of non-screen time (reading/homework) was associated with 23·1(14·6,31·6) more points. Screen time was still associated with poorer scores after adjusting for objective PA/SED and reading/homework.\nAn extra hour/day of screen time at 14·5y is approximately equivalent to two fewer GCSE grades (e.g., from B to D) at 16y. Strategies to achieve the right balance between screen and non-screen time may be important for improving academic performance. Concerns that encouraging more physical activity may result in decreased academic performance seem unfounded.","authors":["Kirsten Corder","Andrew J Atkin","Diane Bamber","Soren Brage"],"meta":["December 2015International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity 12(1)","DOI:10.1186/s12966-015-0269-2"],"references":["279550460_Children_Adolescents_and_the_Media","273508012_Perceived_family_functioning_and_friendship_quality_Cross-sectional_associations_with_physical_activity_and_sedentary_behaviours","267735195_The_Association_Between_Objectively_Measured_Physical_Activity_and_Academic_Achievement_in_Dutch_Adolescents_Findings_From_the_GOALS_Study","324683968_Letter_to_the_editor_standardized_use_of_the_terms_sedentary_and_sedentary_behaviours","293777463_Hierarchy_of_individual_calibration_levels_for_heart_rate_and_accelerometry_to_measure_physical_activity_Journal_of_Applied_Physiology_2007_103_682-692_DOI_101152japplphysiol000922006","292693427_Policy_statement_Children_adolescents_and_television","286015106_Sedentary_Behavior_and_Health_Outcomes_in_Children_and_Adolescents","281849081_Physical_activity_and_cognition_in_adolescents_A_systematic_review","268230299_VII_The_history_of_physical_activity_and_academic_performance_research_Informing_the_future","261997745_LinearNonlinear_Relations_of_Activity_and_Fitness_With_Children's_Academic_Achievement"]}
