{"id":"304073561_Influence_of_the_Programming_Environment_on_Programming_Education","abstract":"Although both visual and text environments have been used to teach programming, the most appropriate method for beginners is unknown. Herein we research the most suitable programming environment to introduce programming to beginners using Minecraft to provide different programming learning environments (Visual or Text) via ComputerCraftEdu as an extended function. The learning effects between these two environments are compared using a lecture course. The results show that a visual environment is more suitable to introduce programming to beginners.","authors":["Daisuke Saito","Hironori Washizaki","Yoshiaki Fukazawa"],"meta":["July 2016","DOI:10.1145/2899415.2925477","Conference: 21th Annual Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education (ITiCSE 2016), Poster"],"references":["312449083_Exploring_Minecraft_as_a_conduit_for_increasing_interest_in_programming"]}
