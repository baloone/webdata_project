{"id":"321710211_An_improved_optimum-path_forest_clustering_algorithm_for_remote_sensing_image_segmentation","abstract":"Remote sensing image segmentation is a key technology for processing remote sensing images. The image segmentation results can be used for feature extraction, target identification and object description. Thus, image segmentation directly affects the subsequent processing results. This paper proposes a novel Optimum-Path Forest (OPF) clustering algorithm that can be used for remote sensing segmentation. The method utilizes the principle that the cluster centres are characterized based on their densities and the distances between the centres and samples with higher densities. A new OPF clustering algorithm probability density function is defined based on this principle and applied to remote sensing image segmentation. Experiments are conducted using five remote sensing land cover images. The experimental results illustrate that the proposed method can outperform the original OPF approach.","authors":["Siya Chen","Tieli Sun","Fengqin Yang","Hongguang Sun"],"meta":["December 2017Computers & Geosciences 112","DOI:10.1016/j.cageo.2017.12.003"],"references":["271913544_Clustering_of_Hyperspectral_Images_with_an_Ensemble_Method_Based_on_Fuzzy_C-Means_and_Markov_Random_Fields","264828740_Semisupervised_Classification_of_Remote_Sensing_Images_With_Hierarchical_Spatial_Similarity","264591307_Toward_Satellite-Based_Land_Cover_Classification_Through_Optimum-Path_Forest","259992946_A_Path-_and_Label-cost_Propagation_Approach_to_speedup_the_Training_of_the_Optimum-Path_Forest_Classifier","258836693_Nature-Inspired_Framework_for_Hyperspectral_Band_Selection","227673269_Data_Clustering_as_an_Optimum-Path_Forest_Problem_with_Applications_in_Image_Analysis","224377470_A_Cluster_Separation_Measure","222102642_Semisupervised_Classification_of_Remote_Sensing_Images_With_Active_Queries","220412514_Soft_spectral_clustering_ensemble_applied_to_image_segmentation","51801698_Spectral-Spatial_Classification_of_Hyperspectral_Data_Based_on_a_Stochastic_Minimum_Spanning_Forest_Approach","3450061_Semisupervised_Image_Classification_With_Laplacian_Support_Vector_Machines","3205816_Spectral_Clustering_Ensemble_Applied_to_SAR_Image_Segmentation","312538118_Support-vector_networks","299680550_A_Novel_Graph_Based_Clustering_Technique_for_Hybrid_Segmentation_of_Multi-spectral_Remotely_Sensed_Images","267572565_A_nature-inspired_approach_to_speed_up_optimum-path_forest_clustering_and_its_application_to_intrusion_detection_in_computer_networks","264743816_Remote_Sensing_Image_Segmentation_Based_on_an_Improved_2-D_Gradient_Histogram_and_MMAD_Model","263476029_Machine_learning_Clustering_by_fast_search_and_find_of_density_peaks","261923847_An_Adaptive_Memetic_Fuzzy_Clustering_Algorithm_With_Spatial_Information_for_Remote_Sensing_Imagery","258793027_Incremental_and_Decremental_Affinity_Propagation_for_Semisupervised_Clustering_in_Multispectral_Images","258789385_A_Spatial_Clustering_Method_With_Edge_Weighting_for_Image_Segmentation","256939043_Segmentation_of_sandstone_thin_section_images_with_separation_of_touching_grains_using_optimum_path_forest_operators","235154359_Isodata_A_Novel_Method_of_Data_Analysis_and_Pattern_Classification","230866423_Brain_Tissue_MR-Image_Segmentation_via_Optimum-Path_Forest_Clustering","227602487_Supervised_Pattern_Classification_Based_on_Optimum-Path_Forest","224383372_Hyperspectral_Classification_Fusion_for_Classifying_Different_Military_Targets","224177657_Urban_Image_Classification_With_Semisupervised_Multiscale_Cluster_Kernels","224174209_Multiple_Spectral-Spatial_Classification_Approach_for_Hyperspectral_Data","224170523_Semisupervised_Hyperspectral_Image_Segmentation_Using_Multinomial_Logistic_Regression_With_Active_Learning","224097205_Adaptive_Fuzzy_Moving_K-means_Clustering_Algorithm_for_Image_Segmentation","222705603_Segmentation_and_classification_of_hyperspectral_images_using_watershed_transformation","220845317_A_New_Variant_of_the_Optimum-Path_Forest_Classifier","220049031_Normalized_Cuts_and_Image_Segmentation","40850195_Segmentation_and_Classification_of_Hyperspectral_Images_Using_Minimum_Spanning_Forest_Grown_From_Automatically_Selected_Markers","24056046_Comparing_Partitions","4183501_Efficient_multistage_approach_for_unsupervised_image_classification","4110649_Hierarchical_clustering_approach_for_unsupervised_image_classification_of_hyperspectral_data","3204188_A_Multilevel_Context-Based_System_for_Classification_of_Very_High_Spatial_Resolution_Images"]}
