{"id":"315456820_Heterogeneous_micro-structure_of_percolation_in_sparse_networks","abstract":"We examine the heterogeneous responses of individual nodes in sparse networks to the random removal of a fraction of edges. Using the message-passing formulation of percolation, we discover considerable variation across the network in the probability of a particular node to remain part of the giant component, and in the expected size of small clusters containing that node. In the vicinity of the percolation threshold, weakly non-linear analysis reveals that node-to-node heterogeneity is captured by the recently introduced notion of non-backtracking centrality. We supplement these results for fixed finite networks by a population dynamics approach to analyse random graph models in the infinite system size limit, also providing closed-form approximations for the large mean degree limit of Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi random graphs. Interpreted in terms of the application of percolation to real-world processes, our results shed light on the heterogeneous exposure of different nodes to cascading failures, epidemic spread, and information flow.","authors":["Reimer Kuehn","Tim Rogers"],"meta":["March 2017EPL (Europhysics Letters) 118(6)","DOI:10.1209/0295-5075/118/68003"],"references":["313845332_Non-backtracking_expansion_of_finite_graphs","279633303_Influence_maximization_in_complex_networks_through_optimal_percolation","258924057_Spectral_Redemption_in_Clustering_Sparse_Networks","11092969_Percolation_Critical_Exponents_in_Scale-Free_Networks","1822682_The_Bethe_lattice_spin_glass_revisited","268881422_Tight_Lower_Bound_for_Percolation_Threshold_on_an_Infinite_Graph","264708826_Epidemic_processes_in_complex_networks","262049877_Percolation_on_Sparse_Networks","259824255_Localization_and_centrality_in_networks","223145767_On_the_critical_behavior_of_the_general_epidemic_process_and_dynamical_percolation","46423221_Message_passing_approach_for_general_epidemic_models","12193020_Network_Robustness_and_Fragility_Percolation_on_Random_Graphs","11846504_Random_Graphs_with_Arbitrary_Degree_Distributions_and_their_Applications","11150330_Spread_of_Epidemic_Disease_on_Networks","7200421_A_Simple_Model_of_Global_Cascades_on_Random_Networks"]}
