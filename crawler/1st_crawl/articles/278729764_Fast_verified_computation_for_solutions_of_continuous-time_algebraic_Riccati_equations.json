{"id":"278729764_Fast_verified_computation_for_solutions_of_continuous-time_algebraic_Riccati_equations","abstract":"A fast numerical algorithm for computing interval matrices containing solutions of continuous-time algebraic Riccati equations is proposed. This algorithm utilizes numerical spectral decomposition and involves only cubic complexity. Stabilizing and anti-stabilizing properties and uniqueness of the contained solution can moreover be verified by this algorithm. Numerical results show the property of this algorithm.","authors":["Shinya Miyajima"],"meta":["June 2015Japan Journal of Industrial and Applied Mathematics 32(2)","DOI:10.1007/s13160-015-0178-4"],"references":["2581924_CAREX_-_A_Collection_of_Benchmark_Examples_for_Continuous-Time_Algebraic_Riccati_Equations_Version_20","309281792_Verified_calculation_of_the_solution_of_algebraic_Riccati_equation","309281613_Verified_computation_of_symmetric_solutions_to_continuous-time_algebraic_Riccati_matrix_equations","282786086_Fast_Enclosure_for_All_Eigenvalues_and_Invariant_Subspaces_in_Generalized_Eigenvalue_Problems","275967213_Matrix_Analysis_and_Applied_Linear_Algebra_Book_and_Solutions_Manual","268661059_Developments_in_Reliable_Computing","265482975_Numerical_solution_of_algebraic_Riccati_equations_volume_9_of_Fundamentals_of_Algorithms","258552577_Verified_Numerical_Computation_in_LQ_Control_Problem","257200203_Topics_in_Matrix_Analysis","256805766_Fast_enclosure_for_solutions_of_Sylvester_equations","241478917_An_Algorithm_for_Computing_Reducing_Subspaces_by_Block_Diagonalization","226322474_Newton-Algorithm_zur_Bestimmung_von_Nullstellen_mit_Fehleshranken","2818963_Intlab_-_Interval_Laboratory"]}
