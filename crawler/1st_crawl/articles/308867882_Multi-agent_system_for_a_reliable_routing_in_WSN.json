{"id":"308867882_Multi-agent_system_for_a_reliable_routing_in_WSN","abstract":"The multi agent-system technology (MAS) may be adopted in large scale wireless sensor networks (WSNs) to describe the behaviors of intelligent sensor nodes. One of the problems with the current routing schemas in WSNs is that these schemas use optimal paths that consume the least amount of energy. Along the optimal path, the intermediate nodes will consume their energy and eventually die; thereby creating holes in the communication network. Thus, it is sometimes preferable to use non-optimal, but reliable paths. The main objective of such an approach is to provide an efficient routing with balanced energy consumption for a reliable routing path, in order to extend the lifespan of the WSN. In this paper, we propose a schema for data collection based on the MAS, with the use of mobile agents (MAs) to collect the information according to an optimal and reliable routing schema. Successive simulations in the WSNs on a large scale using the SINALGO simulator show the performance of our proposal, in terms of energy consumption and the rate of packet delivery.","authors":["Mostefa Bendjima","Mohammed Feham"],"meta":["July 2015","DOI:10.1109/SAI.2015.7237331","Conference: 2015 Science and Information Conference (SAI)","Project: Wireless sensors networks optimization"],"references":["269524174_Optimal_itinerary_planning_for_mobile_multiple_agents_in_WSN","225165002_Survey_on_Data_Routing_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","224085219_Effective_Determination_of_Mobile_Agent_Itineraries_for_Data_Aggregation_on_Sensor_Networks","221091578_A_wireless_sensor_network_For_structural_monitoring","49586528_Network_Layer_Protocols_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_Existing_Classifications_and_Design_Challenges","4117435_Serial_data_fusion_using_space-filling_curves_in_wireless_sensor_networks","3297289_On_computing_mobile_agent_routes_for_data_fusion_in_distributed_sensor_networks","3198885_MANNA_A_Management_Architecture_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","3043802_Replicated_process_allocation_for_load_distribution_in_fault-tolerant_multicomputers","242751000_Multi-Agent_Itinerary_Planning_for_Sensor_Networks_Invited_Paper","232638244_Mobile_Agent_Routing_Algorithm_in_Dynamic_Sensor_Network","230995201_A_lightweight_target-tracking_scheme_using_wireless_sensor_network","224400696_Agent-cooperation_based_communication_architecture_for_wireless_sensor_networks","222702366_A_Survey_on_Routing_Protocols_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","221587965_Base_Station_Assisted_Hierarchical_Cluster-Based_Routing","221502561_Multi-Agent_Itinerary_Planning_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","220385251_Agent-Based_System_Architecture_for_Dynamic_and_Open_Environments","4198576_Data_dissemination_based_on_mobile_agent_in_wireless_sensor_networks","4112068_Agent-Based_Energy_Efficient_Routing_in_Sensor_Networks","4070660_Sensor_networks_with_mobile_agents","2986183_Mobile-agent-based_collaborative_signal_and_information_processing_in_sensor_network"]}
