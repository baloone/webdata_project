{"id":"228709680_A_study_of_the_characteristics_of_white_noise_using_the_empirical_mode_decomposition_method","abstract":"Based on numerical experiments on white noise using the empirical mode decompo-sition (EMD) method, we find empirically that the EMD is effectively a dyadic filter, the intrinsic mode function (IMF) components are all normally distributed, and the Fourier spectra of the IMF components are all identical and cover the same area on a semi-logarithmic period scale. Expanding from these empirical findings, we further deduce that the product of the energy density of IMF and its corresponding averaged period is a constant, and that the energy-density function is chi-squared distributed. Furthermore, we derive the energy-density spread function of the IMF components. Through these results, we establish a method of assigning statistical significance of information content for IMF components from any noisy data. Southern Oscillation Index data are used to illustrate the methodology developed here.","authors":["Zhaohua Wu","Norden Huang"],"meta":["June 2004Proceedings of The Royal Society A Mathematical Physical and Engineering Sciences 460(2046):1597-1611","DOI:10.1098/rspa.2003.1221"],"references":["269402667_The_Impact_of_global_warming_on_ENSO_variability_in_climate_records","215754718_The_empirical_mode_decomposition_and_the_Hilbert_spectrum_for_nonlinear_and_non-stationary_time_series_analysis","2413863_Advanced_Spectral_Methods_for_Climatic_Time_Series","313423537_The_empirical_mode_decomposition_and_the_Hilbert_spectrum_for_nonlinear_and_non-stationary_time_series_analysis","292215406_A_new_view_of_nonlinear_water_waves_the_Hilbert_spectrum","282059678_Empirical_mode_decomposition_as_a_filter_bank","275067058_Probability_Random_Variables_and_Stochastic_Processes_2nd_Edition","261626865_Probability_Random_Variables_and_Stochastic_Processes","252086216_Signal_Versus_Noise_in_the_Southern_Oscillation","200705602_Probability_Random_Variables_and_Stochastic_Process","30766858_A_new_view_of_non-linear_water_waves_The_Hilbert_Spectrum","3342944_Empirical_mode_decomposition_as_a_filterbank_IEEE_Signal_Proc_Lett"]}
