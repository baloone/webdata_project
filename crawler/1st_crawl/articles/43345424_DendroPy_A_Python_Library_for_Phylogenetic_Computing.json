{"id":"43345424_DendroPy_A_Python_Library_for_Phylogenetic_Computing","abstract":"DendroPy is a cross-platform library for the Python programming language that provides for object-oriented reading, writing,\nsimulation and manipulation of phylogenetic data, with an emphasis on phylogenetic tree operations. DendroPy uses a splits-hash\nmapping to perform rapid calculations of tree distances, similarities and shape under various metrics. It contains rich simulation\nroutines to generate trees under a number of different phylogenetic and coalescent models. DendroPy's data simulation and\nmanipulation facilities, in conjunction with its support of a broad range of phylogenetic data formats (NEXUS, Newick, PHYLIP,\nFASTA, NeXML, etc.), allow it to serve a useful role in various phyloinformatics and phylogeographic pipelines.\n\nAvailability: The stable release of the library is available for download and automated installation through the Python Package Index site\n(http://pypi.python.org/pypi/DendroPy), while the active development source code repository is available to the public from GitHub (http://github.com/jeetsukumaran/DendroPy).\n\nContact: jeet{at}ku.edu","authors":["Jeet Sukumaran","Mark T Holder"],"meta":["June 2010Bioinformatics 26(12):1569-71","DOI:10.1093/bioinformatics/btq228","SourcePubMed"],"references":["41012249_ETE_A_python_Environment_for_Tree_Exploration","24218302_Biopython_Freely_available_Python_tools_for_computational_molecular_biology_and_bioinformatics","10603439_Bayes_Estimation_of_Species_Divergence_Times_and_Ancestral_Population_Sizes_Using_DNA_Sequences_From_Multiple_Loci","8911258_APE_Analyses_of_Phylogenetics_and_Evolution_in_R_Language","6130720_Knight_R_PyCogent_a_toolkit_for_making_sense_from_sequence_Genome_Biol_8_R171","299008745_Testing_macro-evolutionary_models_using_incomplete_molecular_phylogenies","271205405_PAUP_Phylogenetic_Analysis_Using_Parsimony_and_Other_Methods_Version_40b10","225436062_Consensus-trees","224839945_On_Information_and_Sufficiency","223155053_Comparison_of_Phylogenetic_Trees","223115706_The_Coalescent","44719767_Inferring_phylogenies_Joseph_Felsenstein","11925847_Pybus_OG_Harvey_PH_Testing_macro-evolutionary_models_using_incomplete_molecular_phylogenies_Proc_R_Soc_London_B_Biol_Sci_267_2267-2272"]}
