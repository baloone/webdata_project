{"id":"311160449_New_optical_orthogonal_signature_pattern_codes_with_maximum_collision_parameter_2_and_weight_4","abstract":"Optical orthogonal signature pattern codes (OOSPCs) play an important role in a novel type of optical code-division multiple-access network for 2-dimensional image transmission. There is a one-to-one correspondence between an \\((m, n, w, \\lambda )\\)-OOSPC and a \\((\\lambda +1)\\)-(mn, w, 1) packing design admitting an automorphism group isomorphic to \\(\\mathbb {Z}_m\\times \\mathbb {Z}_n\\). In 2010, Sawa gave a construction of an (m, n, 4, 2)-OOSPC from a one-factor of Köhler graph of \\(\\mathbb {Z}_m\\times \\mathbb {Z}_n\\) which contains a unique element of order 2. In this paper, we study the existence of one-factor of Köhler graph of \\(\\mathbb {Z}_m\\times \\mathbb {Z}_n\\) having three elements of order 2. It is proved that there is a one-factor in the Köhler graph of \\(\\mathbb {Z}_{2^{\\epsilon }p}\\times \\mathbb {Z}_{2^{\\epsilon '}}\\) relative to the Sylow 2-subgroup if there is an S-cyclic Steiner quadruple system of order 2p, where \\(p\\equiv 5\\pmod {12}\\) is a prime and \\(1\\le \\epsilon ,\\epsilon '\\le 2\\). Using this one-factor, we construct a strictly \\(\\mathbb {Z}_{2^{\\epsilon }p}\\times \\mathbb {Z}_{2^{\\epsilon '}}\\)-invariant regular \\(G^*(p,2^{\\epsilon +\\epsilon '},4,3)\\) relative to the Sylow 2-subgroup. By using the known S-cyclic SQS(2p) and a recursive construction for strictly \\(\\mathbb {Z}_{m}\\times \\mathbb {Z}_{n}\\)-invariant regular G-designs, we construct more strictly \\(\\mathbb {Z}_{m}\\times \\mathbb {Z}_{n}\\)-invariant 3-(mn, 4, 1) packing designs. Consequently, there is an optimal \\((2^{\\epsilon }m,2^{\\epsilon '}n,4,2)\\)-OOSPC for any \\(\\epsilon ,\\epsilon '\\in \\{0,1,2\\}\\) with \\(\\epsilon +\\epsilon '>0\\) and an optimal (6m, 6n, 4, 2)-OOSPC where m, n are odd integers whose all prime divisors from the set \\(\\{p\\equiv 5\\pmod {12}:p\\) is a prime, \\(p<\\)1,500,000}.","authors":["Jingyuan Chen","Lijun Ji","Yun Li"],"meta":["November 2017Designs Codes and Cryptography 85(2)","DOI:10.1007/s10623-016-0310-8"],"references":["300370699_Affine-invariant_strictly_cyclic_Steiner_quadruple_systems","286690428_Further_results_on_optimal_mn41-optical_orthogonal_signature_pattern_codes","285458455_Combinatorial_Constructions_of_Optimal_m_n42_Optical_Orthogonal_Signature_Pattern_Codes","275716569_mn31_optical_orthogonal_signature_pattern_codes_with_maximum_possible_size","329786840_Packings","313552190_Optimal_optical_orthogonal_signature_pattern_codes_of_weight_3","312628261_Code-division_multiple_access_techniques_in_optical_fiber_networks_Part_I_and_part_I_I","285367644_Untersuchungen_uber_S-zyklische_Quadrupelsysteme","272359399_Constructions_of_Strictly_m-Cyclic_and_Semi-Cyclic_Hmn43","271738392_The_completion_determination_of_optimal_34_3_4_-packings","259483278_Combinatorial_constructions_for_optimal_two-dimensional_optical_orthogonal_codes_with_l2","268928376_Zyklische_Losungen_des_Steinerschen_Problems","266977170_A_covering_of_triples_by_quadruples","265435075_Optical_orthogonal_codes_and_cyclic_block_designs","265355245_On_Quadruple_Systems"]}
