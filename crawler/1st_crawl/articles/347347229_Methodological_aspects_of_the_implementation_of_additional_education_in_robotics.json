{"id":"347347229_Methodological_aspects_of_the_implementation_of_additional_education_in_robotics","abstract":"The purpose of the study is actualized by the fact that progress in the field of computer technology and robotics allows radically changing the idea of teaching computer science to schoolchildren, or rather programming in a modern secondary school, realizing one of the most important tasks facing the education system today. The scientific novelty of the study lies in the fact that these achievements allow updating traditional teaching methods, making them much more useful and modern. Nowadays, students have the opportunity to study various programming languages at school and at the same time, using the developed resources, observe the process of their execution by specially created robots, which can develop the student's desire to study further and give motivation to study the academic discipline. The practical significance of the work lies in the fact that one of such projects containing educational resources and allowing a different look at modern computer science lessons is LEGO and ROBBO. The advantages and disadvantages of traditional methods of teaching programming languages in high school are analyzed in the study. Also, the advantages of learning programming with LEGO and ROBBO are revealed, methodological recommendations for using the LEGO and ROBBO programming environment are presented, the capabilities of the LEGO project and ROBBO are described, and their main elements are characterized.","authors":["Oksana Kadeeva","Alexander Belov","Valentina Syritsyna","Svetlana Maksimenko"],"meta":["January 2020E3S Web of Conferences 210(104):22040","DOI:10.1051/e3sconf/202021022040"],"references":[]}
