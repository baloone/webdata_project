{"id":"313228704_Codes_Correcting_a_Burst_of_Deletions_or_Insertions","abstract":"This paper studies codes that correct a burst of deletions or insertions. Namely, a code will be called a b-burstdeletion/ insertion-correcting code if it can correct a burst of deletions/ insertions of any b consecutive bits. While the lower bound on the redundancy of such codes was shown by Levenshtein to be asymptotically log(n)+b�1, the redundancy of the best code construction by Cheng et al. is b(log(n=b + 1)). In this paper, we close on this gap and provide codes with redundancy at most log(n) + (b � 1) log(log(n)) + b � log(b). We first show that the models of insertions and deletions are equivalent and thus it is enough to study codes correcting a burst of deletions. We then derive a non-asymptotic upper bound on the size of b-burst-deletion-correcting codes and extend the burst deletion model to two more cases: 1) A deletion burst of at most b consecutive bits and 2) A deletion burst of size at most b (not necessarily consecutive). We extend our code construction for the first case and study the second case for b = 3; 4.","authors":["Clayton Schoeny","Antonia Wachter-Zeh","Ryan Gabrys","Eitan Yaakobi"],"meta":["January 2017IEEE Transactions on Information Theory PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TIT.2017.2661747"],"references":["277667113_Coding_Techniques_for_Digital_Recorders","268223352_Codes_for_Correcting_Three_or_More_Adjacent_Deletions_or_Insertions","265787917_On_Single-Deletion-Correcting_Codes","335796882_Coding_Techniques_for_InsertionDeletion_Error_Correction","322808533_The_Longest_Run_of_Heads","319390214_Efficient_Low-Redundancy_Codes_for_Correcting_Multiple_Deletions","306116219_Codes_correcting_a_burst_of_deletions_or_insertions","280329908_Efficient_Low-Redundancy_Codes_for_Correcting_Multiple_Deletions","268312149_Codes_for_correcting_insertion_and_deletion_errors","268050583_Forward_Error_Correction_in_Sensor_Networks"]}
