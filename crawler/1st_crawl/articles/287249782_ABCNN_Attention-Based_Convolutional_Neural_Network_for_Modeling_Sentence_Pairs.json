{"id":"287249782_ABCNN_Attention-Based_Convolutional_Neural_Network_for_Modeling_Sentence_Pairs","abstract":"How to model a pair of sentences is a critical issue in many natural language\nprocessing (NLP) tasks such as answer selection (AS), paraphrase identification\n(PI) and textual entailment (TE). Most prior work (i) deals with one individual\ntask by fine-tuning a specific system; (ii) models each sentence separately,\nwithout considering the impact of the other sentence; or (iii) relies fully on\nmanually designed, task-specific linguistic features. This work presents a\ngeneral Attention Based Convolutional Neural Network (ABCNN) for modeling a\npair of sentences. We make three contributions. (i) ABCNN can be applied to a\nwide variety of tasks that require modeling of sentence pairs. (ii) We propose\nthree attention schemes that integrate mutual influence between sentences into\nCNN; thus, the representation of each sentence takes into consideration its\ncounterpart. These interdependent sentence pair representations are more\npowerful than isolated sentence representations. (iii) ABCNN achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on AS, PI and TE tasks.","authors":["Wenpeng Yin","Hinrich Sch√ºtze","Bing Xiang","Bowen Zhou"],"meta":["December 2015Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics 4(1)","DOI:10.1162/tacl_a_00244","SourcearXiv"],"references":["308845461_The_application_of_two-level_attention_models_in_deep_convolutional_neural_network_for_fine-grained_image_classification","288714023_Learning_Transferrable_Knowledge_for_Semantic_Segmentation_with_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Network","285271115_A_Deep_Architecture_for_Semantic_Matching_with_Multiple_Positional_Sentence_Representations","284219105_ABC-CNN_An_Attention_Based_Convolutional_Neural_Network_for_Visual_Question_Answering","283986649_LSTM-based_Deep_Learning_Models_for_Non-factoid_Answer_Selection","273471942_Convolutional_Neural_Network_Architectures_for_Matching_Natural_Language_Sentences","269117118_Deep_Learning_for_Answer_Sentence_Selection","269116878_End-to-end_Continuous_Speech_Recognition_using_Attention-based_Recurrent_NN_First_Results","265252627_Neural_Machine_Translation_by_Jointly_Learning_to_Align_and_Translate","264978373_UNAL-NLP_Combining_Soft_Cardinality_Features_for_Semantic_Textual_Similarity_Relatedness_and_Entailment","264003485_SemEval-2014_Task_1_Evaluation_of_Compositional_Distributional_Semantic_Models_on_Full_Sentences_through_Semantic_Relatedness_and_Textual_Entailment","262974821_Recursive_Neural_Networks_Can_Learn_Logical_Semantics","262484733_A_SICK_cure_for_the_evaluation_of_compositional_distributional_semantic_models","257882504_Distributed_Representations_of_Words_and_Phrases_and_their_Compositionality","228971629_Unsupervised_construction_of_large_paraphrase_corpora_Exploiting_massively_parallel_news_sources","228452494_Dynamic_Pooling_and_Unfolding_Recursive_Autoencoders_for_Paraphrase_Detection","221012718_What_is_the_Jeopardy_Model_A_Quasi-Synchronous_Grammar_for_QA","220817006_Discriminative_Learning_over_Constrained_Latent_Representations","220320677_Adaptive_Subgradient_Methods_for_Online_Learning_and_Stochastic_Optimization","325933705_ABC-CNN_An_attention_based_convolutional_neural_network_for_visual_question_answering","319770369_Distributed_Representations_of_Words_and_Phrases_and_their_Compositionality","311610308_Learning_Transferrable_Knowledge_for_Semantic_Segmentation_with_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Network","304408489_Look_and_Think_Twice_Capturing_Top-Down_Visual_Attention_with_Feedback_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","301445967_Multi-Perspective_Sentence_Similarity_Modeling_with_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","301445887_WikiQA_A_Challenge_Dataset_for_Open-Domain_Question_Answering","301409028_ECNU_One_Stone_Two_Birds_Ensemble_of_Heterogenous_Measures_for_Semantic_Relatedness_and_Textual_Entailment","301408986_Illinois-LH_A_Denotational_and_Distributional_Approach_to_Semantics","301405437_Convolutional_Neural_Network_for_Paraphrase_Identification","301404932_MultiGranCNN_An_Architecture_for_General_Matching_of_Text_Chunks_on_Multiple_Levels_of_Granularity","288449278_Discriminative_improvements_to_distributional_sentence_similarity","286906058_Semi-Markov_phrase-based_monolingual_alignment","281487270_A_Neural_Attention_Model_for_Abstractive_Sentence_Summarization","281227635_A_large_annotated_corpus_for_learning_natural_language_inference","281145060_Effective_Approaches_to_Attention-based_Neural_Machine_Translation","280873241_Applying_Deep_Learning_to_Answer_Selection_A_Study_and_An_Open_Task","277722709_A_Hierarchical_Neural_Autoencoder_for_Paragraphs_and_Documents","272422583_DRAW_A_Recurrent_Neural_Network_For_Image_Generation","270877996_Automatic_Coupling_of_Answer_Extraction_and_Information_Retrieval","270877716_Question_Answering_Using_Enhanced_Lexical_Semantic_Models","269997606_Multiple_Object_Recognition_with_Visual_Attention","263390366_Recurrent_Models_of_Visual_Attention","262416109_Distributed_Representations_of_Sentences_and_Documents","262352255_A_comparison_of_vector-based_representations_for_semantic_composition","262156969_Re-examining_Machine_Translation_Metrics_for_Paraphrase_Identification","224890821_ROUGE_A_Package_for_Automatic_Evaluation_of_summaries","222688606_COGEX_A_semantically_and_contextually_enriched_logic_prover_for_question_answering","221299987_Structured_retrieval_for_question_answering","221012812_Using_Semantic_Roles_to_Improve_Question_Answering","220816708_Tree_Edit_Models_for_Recognizing_Textual_Entailments_Paraphrases_and_Answers_to_Questions","200044309_WordNet_A_Lexical_Database_for_English","13853244_Long_Short-term_Memory","2985446_Gradient-Based_Learning_Applied_to_Document_Recognition","2941838_Mapping_Dependencies_Trees_An_Application_to_Question_Answering"]}
