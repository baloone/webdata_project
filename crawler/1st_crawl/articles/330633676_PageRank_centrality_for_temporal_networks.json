{"id":"330633676_PageRank_centrality_for_temporal_networks","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a new centrality measure for ranking the nodes and time layers of temporal networks simultaneously, referred to as the f-PageRank centrality. The f-PageRank values of nodes and time layers in temporal networks are obtained by solving the eigenvector of a multi-homogeneous map. The existence and uniqueness of the proposed centrality measure are also guaranteed by existing results, under some reasonable conditions. The numerical experiments on a synthetic temporal network and two real-world temporal networks (i.e., Email-Eu-core and CollegeMsg temporal networks) show that the proposed centrality outperforms some existing centrality measures.","authors":["Laishui Lv","Kun Zhang","Ting Zhang","Dalal Bardou"],"meta":["April 2019","DOI:10.1016/j.physleta.2019.01.041"],"references":["321241914_Node_and_Layer_Eigenvector_Centralities_for_Multiplex_Networks","318161392_Sparse_matrix_computations_for_dynamic_network_centrality","279864378_Eigenvector-Based_Centrality_Measures_for_Temporal_Networks","275359239_Ranking_in_interconnected_multilayer_networks_reveals_versatile_nodes","265407921_A_Matrix_Iteration_for_Dynamic_Network_Summaries","259845152_Random_walk_centrality_for_temporal_networks","51152959_Communicability_across_evolving_networks","12002432_Lethality_and_Centrality_in_Protein_Networks","2537159_Comparing_Top_k_Lists","317155440_On_eigenvector-like_centralities_for_temporal_networks_Discrete_vs_continuous_time_scales","317084030_The_PageRank_citation_ranking_Bringing_order_to_the_Web_Technical_report","313264273_Motifs_in_Temporal_Networks","284579053_Block_Matrix_Formulations_for_Evolving_Networks","279310683_Coverage_centralities_for_temporal_networks","272199060_Betweenness_in_time_dependent_networks","260520765_Ranking_the_spreading_ability_of_nodes_in_complex_networks_based_on_local_structure","258525412_Communicability_in_temporal_networks","257582042_Centrality_Prediction_in_Dynamic_Human_Contact_Networks","237912898_Authoritative_sources_in_a_hyperlinked_environment","229124516_Power_and_Centrality_A_Family_of_Measures","222671188_A_Measure_of_Betweenness_Centrality_based_on_Random_Walks","221662122_Recommender_Systems","24061828_The_Centrality_Index_of_a_Graph"]}
