{"id":"337995021_Serum_microRNA-135a_as_a_diagnostic_biomarker_in_non-small_cell_lung_cancer","abstract":"The purpose of our research was to evaluate diagnostic performance of serum microRNA-135a (miR-135a) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction was employed to detect the expression serum of miR-135a in NSCLC patients and controls. The influence of serum miR-135a level on clinical characteristics of NSCLC patients was explored through the Chi-square test. Serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level was estimated via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was plotted to elucidate diagnostic roles of serum miR-135a and CEA in NSCLC.The expression level of serum miR-135a was significantly lower in NSCLC patients than in healthy controls (0.40 ± 0.29 vs 1.00 ± 0.40, P < .001). Moreover, miR-135a expression was related to lymph node metastasis (P = .021), tumor differentiation (P = .020), and tumor node metastasis stage (P = .031). ROC curve showed serum miR-135a level could discriminate NSCLC patients from healthy controls (P < .0001) with a corresponding cutoff value of 0.665, and a sensitivity and specificity of 81.3% and 83.1%, respectively. The area under the curve was 0.888. In diagnosis analysis on the combination of miR-135a and CEA, when its specificity was maintained at 90%, diagnosis cut-off point reached 0.678.Serum miR-135a level is significantly downregulated in NSCLC and serves as a potential diagnostic biomarker for the disease.","authors":["Yuanwu Zou","Chengbao Jing","Li Liu","Ting Wang"],"meta":["December 2019Medicine 98(50):e17814","DOI:10.1097/MD.0000000000017814"],"references":["326213586_MicroRNAs_as_potential_biomarkers_for_diagnosis_therapy_and_prognosis_of_gastric_cancer","324502102_DNA_methylation-mediated_repression_of_miR-181a135a302c_expression_promotes_the_microsatellite-unstable_colorectal_cancer_development_and_5-FU_resistance_via_targeting_PLAG1","305800827_miRNA-135a_promotes_hepatocellular_carcinoma_cell_migration_and_invasion_by_targeting_forkhead_box_O1","303552289_miR-135a_Inhibits_the_Invasion_of_Cancer_Cells_via_Suppression_of_ERRa","301533670_Diagnostic_Value_of_Serum_miR-182_miR-183_miR-210_and_miR-126_Levels_in_Patients_with_Early-Stage_Non-Small_Cell_Lung_Cancer","295097984_SULF2_Expression_Is_a_Potential_Diagnostic_and_Prognostic_Marker_in_Lung_Cancer","327696058_Emerging_microRNAs_in_cancer_diagnosis_progression_and_immune_surveillance","317088603_Diagnostic_utility_of_PAX2_and_PAX5_in_distinguishing_non-small_cell_lung_cancer_from_small_cell_lung_cancer","306132588_Serum_microRNA-135a_downregulation_as_a_prognostic_marker_of_non-small_cell_lung_cancer","303402233_Plasma_LUNX_mRNA_a_non-invasive_specific_biomarker_for_diagnosis_and_prognostic_prediction_of_non-small_cell_lung_cancer"]}
