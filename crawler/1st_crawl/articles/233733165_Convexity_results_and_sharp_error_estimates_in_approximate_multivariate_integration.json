{"id":"233733165_Convexity_results_and_sharp_error_estimates_in_approximate_multivariate_integration","abstract":"An interesting property of the midpoint rule and the trapezoidal rule, which is expressed by the so-called Hermite–Hadamard inequalities, is that they provide one-sided approximations to the integral of a convex func-tion. We establish multivariate analogues of the Hermite–Hadamard inequal-ities and obtain access to multivariate integration formulae via convexity, in analogy to the univariate case. In particular, for simplices of arbitrary di-mension, we present two families of integration formulae which both contain a multivariate analogue of the midpoint rule and the trapezoidal rule as bound-ary cases. The first family also includes a multivariate analogue of a Maclaurin formula and of the two-point Gaussian quadrature formula; the second fam-ily includes a multivariate analogue of a formula by P. C. Hammer and of Simpson's rule. In both families, we trace out those formulae which satisfy a Hermite–Hadamard inequality. As an immediate consequence of the latter, we obtain sharp error estimates for twice continuously differentiable functions.","authors":["Guessab Allal","Gerhard Schmeisser"],"meta":["July 2003Mathematics of Computation 73(247):1622-1384","DOI:10.1090/S0025-5718-03-01622-3","Sourcedx.doi.org"],"references":["285266899_Quadrature_Theory_of_Convex_Functions","269844539_Introduction_to_Numerical_Analysis","268705452_Convexity_on_nonconvex_sets","267054918_Error_estimates_for_some_elementary_quadrature_rules","266928664_The_Midpoint_Method_of_Numerical_Integration","248747618_Integration_Formulae_Based_on_the_Trapezoidal_Formula","245346248_An_Introduction_to_Numerical_Analysis_2nd_Ed","242607595_Approximate_Calculation_of_Multiple_Integral","242530443_Numerical_Methods_Based_on_Sinc_and_Analytic_Functions","237251143_On_Hadamard's_inequality_on_a_disk"]}
