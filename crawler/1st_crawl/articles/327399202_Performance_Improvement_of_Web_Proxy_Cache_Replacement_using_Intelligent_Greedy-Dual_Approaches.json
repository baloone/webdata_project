{"id":"327399202_Performance_Improvement_of_Web_Proxy_Cache_Replacement_using_Intelligent_Greedy-Dual_Approaches","abstract":"This paper reports on how intelligent Greedy-Dual approaches based on supervised machine learning were used to improve the web proxy caching performance. The proposed intelligent Greedy-Dual approaches predict the significant web objects' demand for web proxy caching using Naïve Bayes (NB), decision tree (C4.5), or support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. Accordingly, the proposed intelligent Greedy-Dual approaches effectively make the cache replacement decision based on the trained classifiers. The trace-driven simulation results indicated that in terms of byte hit ratio and/or hit ratio, the performance of each of the conventional Greedy-Dual-Size-Frequency (GDSF) and Greedy-Dual-Size (GDS) was noticeably enhanced by applying the proposed Greedy-Dual approaches on five real datasets. © 2018 International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.","authors":["Waleed Ali"],"meta":["January 2018International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications 9(8)","DOI:10.14569/IJACSA.2018.090810"],"references":["283741166_Intelligent_Dynamic_Aging_Approaches_in_Web_Proxy_Cache_Replacement","274640609_Intelligent_Cooperative_Least_Recently_Used_Web_Caching_Policy_based_on_J48_Classifier","228542715_Improving_WWW_proxies_performance_with_Greedy-Dual-Size-Frequency_caching_policy","228517481_Intelligent_web_caching_using_machine_learning_methods","290158761_A_fuzzy_algorithm_for_web_caching","286127445_Performance_improvement_of_least-recently-used_policy_in_web_proxy_cache_replacement_using_supervised_machine_learning","258188092_A_Quantitative_Study_of_Web_Cache_Replacement_Strategies_Using_Simulation","224968918_A_novel_content_classification_scheme_for_web_caches","223678123_Web_page_classification_based_on_a_support_vector_machine_using_a_weighted_vote_schema","223564527_Performance_evaluation_for_implementations_of_a_network_of_proxy_caches"]}
