{"id":"256846085_An_ant_colony_optimization_algorithm_for_job_shop_scheduling_problem","abstract":"The nature has inspired several metaheuristics, outstanding among these is\nAnt Colony Optimization (ACO), which have proved to be very effective and\nefficient in problems of high complexity (NP-hard) in combinatorial\noptimization. This paper describes the implementation of an ACO model algorithm\nknown as Elitist Ant System (EAS), applied to a combinatorial optimization\nproblem called Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). We propose a method that\nseeks to reduce delays designating the operation immediately available, but\nconsidering the operations that lack little to be available and have a greater\namount of pheromone. The performance of the algorithm was evaluated for\nproblems of JSSP reference, comparing the quality of the solutions obtained\nregarding the best known solution of the most effective methods. The solutions\nwere of good quality and obtained with a remarkable efficiency by having to\nmake a very low number of objective function evaluations.","authors":["Edson Flórez","Wilfredo Ariel Gómez Bueno","Lola Bautista"],"meta":["September 2013","SourcearXiv"],"references":["308953674_Ant_Colony_Optimization","301232811_Self-Organized_Shortcuts_in_the_Argentine_Ant","277284831_MAX-MIN_ant_system","260449008_A_new_rank_based_version_of_the_ant_system_A_computational_study","301232798_Probabilistic_Behavior_in_Ants_-_a_Strategy_of_Errors","260480301_Scheduling_in_Computer_and_Manufacturing_Systems","259684752_On_the_Job-Shop_Scheduling_Problem","247074873_Optimization_Learning_and_Natural_Algorithms","239660128_Supplement_to_Resource_Constrained_Project_Scheduling_An_Experimental_Investigation_of_Heuristic_Scheduling_Techniques","238691740_The_Complexity_of_Flowshop_and_Jobshop_Scheduling","228540568_Ant_system_for_job-shop_scheduling","236628927_Probabilistic_behaviour_in_ants_A_strategy_of_errors","235439125_Meta-heuristics_in_combinatorial_optimisation_Overview_and_conceptual_comparison","228795617_Ant_colony_optimization_for_job_shop_scheduling_problem","228057735_Computers_And_Intractability_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness"]}
