{"id":"334856217_Direct_Segmented_Sonification_of_Characteristic_Features_of_the_Data_Domain","abstract":"Like audiﬁcation, auditory graphs maintain the temporal relationships of data while using parameter mappings to represent the ordinate values. Such direct approaches have the advantage of presenting the data stream ‘as is’ without the imposed interpretations or accentuation of particular features found in indirect approaches. However, datasets can often be subdivided into short non-overlapping variable length segments that each encapsulate a discrete unit of domain-speciﬁc signiﬁcant information and current direct approaches cannot represent these. We present Direct Segmented Soniﬁcation (DSSon) for highlighting the segments’ data distributions as individual sonic events. Using domain knowledge DSSon presents segments as discrete auditory gestalts while retaining the overall temporal regime and relationships of the dataset. The method’s structural decoupling from the sound stream’s formation means playback speed is independent of the individual sonic event durations, thereby offering highly ﬂexible time compression/stretching to allow zooming into or out of the data. DSSon displays high directness, letting the data ‘speak’ for themselves.","authors":["Paul Vickers","Robert Höldrich"],"meta":["June 2019","DOI:10.21785/icad2019.043","Conference: ICAD 2019: The 25th International Conference on Auditory DisplayAt: https://icad2019.icad.org/"],"references":["317187975_Movement_amplitude_on_the_Functional_Re-adaptive_Exercise_Device_deep_spinal_muscle_activity_and_movement_control","279851430_AUGMENTED_AUDIFICATION","224927719_Sonification_Abstraite_Sonification_Concrete_An_'Aesthetic_Perspective_Space'_for_Classifying_Auditory_Displays_in_the_Ars_Musica_Domain","220245073_Musical_Program_Auralisation_Empirical_Studies","295866198_Comparison_and_Evaluation_of_Sonification_Strategies_for_Guidance_Tasks","277078168_Translating_Sonifications"]}
