{"id":"238804461_Efficient_tree_codes_on_SIMD_computer_architectures","abstract":"This paper describes changes made to a previous implementation of an N-body tree code developed for a fine-grained, SIMD computer architecture. These changes include (1) switching from a balanced binary tree to a balanced oct tree, (2) addition of quadrupole corrections, and (3) having the particles search the tree in groups rather than individually. An algorithm for limiting errors is also discussed. In aggregate, these changes have led to a performance increase of over a factor of 10 compared to the previous code. For problems several times larger than the processor array, the code now achieves performance levels of âˆ¼ 1 Gflop on the Maspar MP-2 or roughly 20% of the quoted peak performance of this machine. This percentage is competitive with other parallel implementations of tree codes on MIMD architectures. This is significant, considering the low relative cost of SIMD architectures.","authors":["Kevin Olson"],"meta":["November 1996Computer Physics Communications 98(3):267-287","DOI:10.1016/0010-4655(96)00096-3"],"references":["4677246_An_implementation_of_a_tree_code_on_a_SIMD_parallel_computer","2754899_A_Performance_Study_of_Cosmological_Simulations_on_Message-Passing_and_Shared-Memory_Multiprocessors","260541931_A_Hierarchical_ON_log_N_Force-Calculation_Algorithm","256431406_Gravitational_N-body_algorithms_A_comparison_between_supercomputers_and_a_highly_parallel_computer","238979320_A_Fast_Adaptive_Multipole_Algorithm_for_Particle_Simulations","234250016_Error_analysis_of_a_tree_code","234233566_A_tree_code_with_logarithmic_reduction_of_force_terms_hierarchical_regularization_of_all_variables_and_explicit_accuracy_controls","234227361_Performance_Characteristics_of_Tree_Codes","225092394_An_Efficient_Program_for_Many-Body_Simulation","225092360_Vectorization_of_Tree_Traversals","222795675_A_modified_tree_code_Don't_laugh_It_runs","2757575_Skeletons_from_the_Treecode_Closet","2419578_A_Parallel_Hashed_Oct-Tree_N-Body_Algorithm"]}
