{"id":"311896911_Project_sustainability_strategies_A_systematic_literature_review","abstract":"Because research focusing on sustainability in a project context is still nascent and fragmented, we carried out a systematic literature review covering all research published in five leading journals in the fields of project management and sustainable production prior to 2016. Our analysis revealed two distinct perspectives in the project sustainability research; one assumes the perspective of the project organisation delivering the asset while the second assumes the perspective of the host organisation. We identify and describe eight distinct strategies used by either the project organisation, its host, or both in collaboration to support sustainability goals. We complement the findings of our literature review with an illustrative empirical case focusing on the delivery of an innovative seawater-based heating solution in Norway.","authors":["Wenche Aarseth","Tuomas Ahola","Kirsi Aaltonen","Andreas Ã˜kland"],"meta":["December 2016International Journal of Project Management 35(6)","DOI:10.1016/j.ijproman.2016.11.006"],"references":["287798529_Lean_and_Green_strategy_The_Lean_and_Green_House_and_Maturity_deployment_model","280266447_Sustainable_infrastructure_projects_in_balancing_urban-rural_development_Towards_the_goal_of_efficiency_and_equity","307691243_Persuasion_with_case_studies","301957190_The_role_of_corporations_in_achieving_sustainable_development_a_perspective_from_critical_theory","300714745_Sustainable_development_and_business","296693689_Leadership_Competences_of_Sustainable_Construction_Project_Managers","285582732_The_Challenge_of_Introducing_Sustainability_into_Project_Management_Function_Multiple_Case_Studies","281705497_Reconstructing_Project_Management","279713114_Evaluation_of_Sustainability_Indicators_of_Industrial_Buildings_Focused_on_Petrochemical_Projects","279160231_Economic_sustainability_environmental_sustainability_and_constructability_indicators_related_to_concrete-_and_steel-projects"]}
