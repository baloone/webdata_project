{"id":"289642410_Towards_configurable_data_collection_for_sustainable_supply_chain_communication","abstract":"These days, companies in the automotive and electronics sector are forced by legal regulations and customer needs to collect a myriad of different indicators regarding sustainability of their products. However, in today's supply chains, these products are often the result of the collaboration of a large number of companies. Thus, these companies have to apply complex, cross-organizational, and potentially long-running data collection processes to gather their sustainability data. Comprising a great number of manual and automated tasks for different partners, these processes imply great variability. To support such complex data collection, we have designed a lightweight, automated approach for contextual process configuration.","authors":["Gregor Grambow","N.
