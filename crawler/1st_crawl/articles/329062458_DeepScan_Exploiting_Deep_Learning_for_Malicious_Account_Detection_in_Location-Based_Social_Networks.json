{"id":"329062458_DeepScan_Exploiting_Deep_Learning_for_Malicious_Account_Detection_in_Location-Based_Social_Networks","abstract":"Our daily lives have been immersed in widespread location-based social networks (LBSNs). As an open platform, LBSNs typically allow all kinds of users to register accounts. Malicious attackers can easily join and post misleading information, often with the intention of influencing users' decisions in urban computing environments. To provide reliable information and improve the experience for legitimate users, we design and implement DeepScan, a malicious account detection system for LBSNs. Different from existing approaches, DeepScan leverages emerging deep learning technologies to learn users' dynamic behavior. In particular, we introduce the long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network to conduct time series analysis of user activities. DeepScan combines newly introduced time series features and a set of conventional features extracted from user activities, and exploits a supervised machine-learning-based model for detection. Using real traces collected from Dianping, a representative LBSN, we demonstrate that DeepScan can achieve excellent prediction performance with an F1-score of 0.964. We also find that the time series features play a critical role in the detection system.","authors":["Qingyuan Gong","Yang Chen","Xinlei He","Zhou Zhuang"],"meta":["November 2018IEEE Communications Magazine 56(11):21-27","DOI:10.1109/MCOM.2018.1700575","Projects: Metaverse and Social Computing and Networking (MSN) InitiativeSocial Networks and Big Data"],"references":["303015763_Detecting_Rumors_from_Microblogs_with_Recurrent_Neural_Networks","273633251_Analyzing_and_Detecting_Opinion_Spam_on_a_Large-scale_Dataset_via_Temporal_and_Spatial_Patterns","264708029_Revealing_the_City_That_We_Cannot_See","262412815_Aiding_the_detection_of_fake_accounts_in_large_scale_social_online_services","315871449_DeepMood_Forecasting_Depressed_Mood_Based_on_Self-Reported_Histories_via_Recurrent_Neural_Networks","310824798_XGBoost_A_Scalable_Tree_Boosting_System","282988230_You_are_where_you_have_been_Sybil_detection_via_geo-location_analysis_in_OSNs","274494166_Personalized_Recommendations_of_Locally_Interesting_Venues_to_Tourists_via_Cross-Region_Community_Matching","262286411_We_know_how_you_live_Exploring_the_spectrum_of_urban_lifestyles","262174693_Social_spammer_detection_in_microblogging"]}
