{"id":"340894307_Image_Encryption_Based_on_Parallel_Algorithm_via_Zigzag_Manner_with_a_New_Chaotic_System","abstract":"Information safety has become a vital issue and data encryption and decryption have lately been vastly researched and developed. There is a need for a powerful encryption and decryption which is very tough to crack, so cryptography plays a major role to fulfill these demands. Moreover, parallel algorithm is rapidly becoming cost and resource-efficient as a result of a unified approach to solve computer problems and wide-ranging problems encountered in applied sciences and engineering applications. In this paper, a parallel environment has been utilized to construct a new encryption system, based on involving the so-called 'zig-zag' ordering that is used in JPEG data compression. A new chaotic system of three dimensions will be produced to eliminate the common encryption systems problems.","authors":["Khalid Ali Hussien","Sadiq A.
