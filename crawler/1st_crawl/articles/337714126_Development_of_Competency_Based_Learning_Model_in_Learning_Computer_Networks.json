{"id":"337714126_Development_of_Competency_Based_Learning_Model_in_Learning_Computer_Networks","abstract":"Based on preliminary research that has been done, research problems are The purpose of computer network learning has not been clearly defined based on student needs, the learning process of computer networks is not optimal. The development of computer network learning uses a model of competency based learning aimed at helping educators facilitate students to be active, innovative, and creative in constructing their knowledge, through real experiences students get in the learning process. This research is research and development (R & D) that uses competency based learning learning models. Development of competency based learning learning models using the ADDIE model. Based on data analysis, the findings of this study are Competency Based Learning learning model has been successfully developed, The syntax of developed competency based learning models consists of 5 learning steps, Computer network teaching manuals consisting of syllabus and semester learning plan, and WEB-based learning media that are valid, practical, and effective. The results of this study can be used by lecturers, and learning designers in developing or realizing the learning process that can facilitate students to be active, innovative, and creative in developing studentsâ€™ knowledge of computer networks better.","authors":["Raimon Efendi","Jalius Jama","Asmar Yulastri"],"meta":["November 2019Journal of Physics Conference Series 1387(1):012109","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/1387/1/012109"],"references":["301917189_The_Effects_of_Problem-Based-Learning_on_the_Academic_Achievements_of_Medical_Students_in_One_Japanese_Medical_School_Over_a_Twenty-Year_Period","293695551_Industri_40_revolusi_industri_abad_ini_dan_pengaruhnya_pada_bidang_kesehatan_dan_bioteknologi","277651716_A_Proposed_Model_of_Problem-based_Learning_on_Social_Media_in_Cooperation_with_Searching_Technique_to_Enhance_Critical_Thinking_of_Undergraduate_Students","273851110_Problem-Based_Learning_in_Teacher_Education_Its_Promises_and_Challenges","257717250_Cooperative_Problem-based_Learning_CPBL_Framework_for_Integrating_Cooperative_Learning_and_Problem-based_Learning","251713443_The_effectiveness_of_RANGKA_contextual_teaching_and_learning_on_students'_problem_solving_skills_and_scientific_attitude","286059899_Instructional_design_The_ADDIE_approach","285666802_Using_a_problem_based_multimedia_enhanced_approach_in_learning_about_teaching","271937963_The_Transfer_of_Problem-Solving_Skills_from_a_Problem-Based_Learning_Environment","251685627_Problem-based_learning_in_initial_teacher_education_Taking_the_agenda_forward"]}
