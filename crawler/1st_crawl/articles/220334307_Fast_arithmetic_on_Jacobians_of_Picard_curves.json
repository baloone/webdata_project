{"id":"220334307_Fast_arithmetic_on_Jacobians_of_Picard_curves","abstract":"In this paper we present a fast addition algorithm in the Jacobian of a Picard curve over a nite eld Fq of characteristic dierent from 3. This algorithm has a nice geometric interpretation, comparable to the classic \"chord and tangent\" law for the elliptic curves. Computational cost for addition is 144M + 12SQ + 2I and 158M + 16SQ + 2I for doubling.","authors":["St√©phane Flon","Roger Oyono"],"meta":["January 2003","SourceDBLP"],"references":["246573037_Jacobian_varieties_in_Arithmetic_Geometry","227184388_Hyperelliptic_Curve_Cryptosystems_Closing_the_Performance_Gap_to_Elliptic_Curves","221355149_A_Public_Key_Cryptosystem_and_a_Signature_Scheme_Based_on_Discrete_Logarithms"]}
