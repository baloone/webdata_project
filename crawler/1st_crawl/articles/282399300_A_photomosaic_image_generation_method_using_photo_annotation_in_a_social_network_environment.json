{"id":"282399300_A_photomosaic_image_generation_method_using_photo_annotation_in_a_social_network_environment","abstract":"With the growing use of social networking services, various applications have been developed to utilize their vast capabilities. Photomosaic techniques, which combine many images to create a new rendering of an input image, can benefit from the capabilities of social networks. In this study, we propose a method that generates a photomosaic image by considering social network context. Our algorithm creates a photomosaic that incorporates photos posted by other users in the users network . We enable the matching function to easily select photos from the albums of users who are connected to the owner of the input image, by computing the closeness of those connections. Moreover, our technique allows the photos in the albums of friends who are annotated in the source image to be matched more effectively.","authors":["Sanghyun Seo","Dongwann Kang"],"meta":["September 2015Multimedia Tools and Applications 75(20)","DOI:10.1007/s11042-015-2867-z"],"references":["229156241_State_of_the_Art_A_Taxonomy_of_Artistic_Stylization_Techniques_for_Images_and_Video","221523247_Video_mosaics","2906640_Simulating_Decorative_Mosaics","262330142_Generation_of_coherent_mosaic_animations_Enhancement_and_evaluation_of_temporal_coherence","257627153_A_study_on_stackable_mosaic_generation_for_mobile_devices","221523242_Cut-out_image_mosaics","220999778_Generating_Photomosaics_An_Empirical_Study","220233882_A_Parallel_Framework_for_Fast_Photomosaics","2805987_Image_Mosaics","2537346_Jigsaw_Image_Mosaics"]}
