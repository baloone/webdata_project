{"id":"347683077_Do_we_predict_upcoming_speech_content_in_naturalistic_environments","abstract":"The ability to predict upcoming actions is a hallmark of cognition. It remains unclear, however, whether the predictive behaviour observed in controlled lab environments generalises to rich, everyday settings. In four virtual reality experiments, we tested whether a well-established marker of linguistic prediction (anticipatory eye movements) replicated when increasing the naturalness of the paradigm by means of immersing participants in naturalistic scenes (Experiment 1), increasing the number of distractor objects (Experiment 2), modifying the proportion of predictable noun-referents (Experiment 3), and manipulating the location of referents relative to the joint attentional space (Experiment 4). Robust anticipatory eye movements were observed for Experiments 1â€“3. The anticipatory effect disappeared, however, in Experiment 4. Our findings suggest that predictive processing occurs in everyday communication if the referents are situated in the joint attentional space. Methodologically, our study confirms that ecological validity and experimental control may go hand-in-hand in the study of human predictive behaviour.","authors":["Evelien Heyselaar","David Peeters","Peter Hagoort"],"meta":["December 2020Language Cognition and Neuroscience 36(2):1-22","DOI:10.1080/23273798.2020.1859568"],"references":["330950594_Virtual_reality_A_game-changing_method_for_the_language_sciences","327808520_Lexical_prediction_in_language_comprehension_a_replication_study_of_grammatical_gender_effects_in_Dutch","325742906_3-4-year-old_children_rapidly_adapt_their_predictions_and_use_them_to_learn_novel_word_meaning","324545763_Predicting_While_Comprehending_Language_A_Theory_and_Review","324473143_Large-scale_replication_study_reveals_a_limit_on_probabilistic_prediction_in_language_comprehension","323556257_Why_and_how_to_use_virtual_reality_to_study_human_social_interaction_The_challenges_of_exploring_a_new_research_landscape","323002032_Autocorrelated_Errors_in_Experimental_Data_in_the_Language_Sciences_Some_Solutions_Offered_by_Generalized_Additive_Mixed_Models","319471308_Sustained_inhibition_of_the_native_language_in_bilingual_language_production_A_virtual_reality_approach","318995716_Language-driven_anticipatory_eye_movements_in_virtual_reality","327606950_Generalized_Additive_Models"]}
