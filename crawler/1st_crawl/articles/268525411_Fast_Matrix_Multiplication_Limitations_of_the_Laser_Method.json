{"id":"268525411_Fast_Matrix_Multiplication_Limitations_of_the_Laser_Method","abstract":"Until a few years ago, the fastest known matrix multiplication algorithm, due\nto Coppersmith and Winograd (1990), ran in time $O(n^{2.3755})$. Recently, a\nsurge of activity by Stothers, Vassilevska-Williams, and Le Gall has led to an\nimproved algorithm running in time $O(n^{2.3729})$. These algorithms are\nobtained by analyzing higher and higher tensor powers of a certain identity of\nCoppersmith and Winograd. We show that this exact approach cannot result in an\nalgorithm with running time $O(n^{2.3725})$, and identify a wide class of\nvariants of this approach which cannot result in an algorithm with running time\n$O(n^{2.3078})$; in particular, this approach cannot prove the conjecture that\nfor every $\\epsilon > 0$, two $n\\times n$ matrices can be multiplied in time\n$O(n^{2+\\epsilon})$.\nWe describe a new framework extending the original laser method, which is the\nmethod underlying the previously mentioned algorithms. Our framework\naccommodates the algorithms by Coppersmith and Winograd, Stothers,\nVassilevska-Williams and Le Gall. We obtain our main result by analyzing this\nframework. The framework is also the first to explain why taking tensor powers\nof the Coppersmith-Winograd identity results in faster algorithms.","authors":["Andris Ambainis","Yuval Filmus","Francois Le Gall"],"meta":["November 2014","SourcearXiv"],"references":["300576269_Fast_Matrix_Multiplication","342571583_Tensor_rank_is_NP-complete","309535089_Fast_matrix_multiplication_using_coherent_configurations","284758788_Vermeidung_von_Divisionen","268380665_Breaking_the_Coppersmith-Winograd_barrier","262289301_Multiplying_matrices_faster_than_Coppersmith-Winograd","259983448_Powers_of_Tensors_and_Fast_Matrix_Multiplication","259431864_Improved_bound_for_complexity_of_matrix_multiplication","247383407_Relative_bilinear_complexity_and_matrix_multiplication","243110163_Vermeidung_von_Divisionen"]}
