{"id":"260528401_Networking_theoretical_frames_The_ReMath_enterprise","abstract":"In this article of the special issue devoted to the European project ReMath, we present and discuss the affordances of this project in terms of networking between theoretical frameworks. After clarifying the vision of theories and networking adopted in this project, we introduce the methodological constructs that have been developed and used in ReMath for performing the planned networking enterprise. We then present its outcomes, focusing on different facets of this networking activity: the identification of possible connections and complementarities between frameworks, the identification and elaboration of boundary objects between cultures, and the progressive building of a shared theoretical framework regarding semiotic representations. In the last part of this article, we review the whole networking enterprise from the perspective of research praxeology.","authors":["Mich√®le Artigue","Maria Alessandra Mariotti"],"meta":["March 2014Educational Studies in Mathematics 85(3)","DOI:10.1007/s10649-013-9522-2"],"references":["319089915_Networking_of_Theories_in_Mathematics_Education","289726586_L'integration_d'instruments_informatiques_dans_l'enseignement_Une_approche_par_les_techniques","265583267_RESEARCH_PRAXEOLOGIES_AND_NETWORKING_THEORIES","260321070_Semiotic_Mediation_in_the_Mathematics_Classroom_Artefacts_and_Signs_after_a_Vygotskian_Perspective","257557420_Synergies_between_theoretical_approaches_to_mathematics_education_with_technology_A_case_study_through_a_cross-analysis_methodology","236483758_Casyopee_in_the_classroom_two_different_theory-driven_pedagogical_approaches","227295195_Networking_strategies_and_methods_for_connecting_theoretical_approaches_First_steps_towards_a_conceptual_framework","226458890_L'integration_d'instruments_informatiques_dans_l'enseignement_Une_approche_par_les_techniques_Integrating_instruments_of_informatics_in_teaching_A_technique--oriented_approach_Educational_Studies_in_M","226269524_Connecting_theories_in_mathematics_education_Challenges_and_possibilities","226262115_Learning_Mathematics_in_a_CAS_Environment_The_Genesis_of_a_Reflection_about_Instrumentation_and_the_Dialectics_between_Technical_and_Conceptual_Work","42424472_Theories_of_Mathematics_Education_Seeking_New_Frontiers","32231377_Integrative_theoretical_framework","317953564_Activity_Consciousness_and_Personality","317953561_Mind_in_society_The_development_of_higher_psychological_processes","317953505_Situated_learning_Legitimate_peripheral_participation","305389454_Institutional_Ecology_'Translations'_and_Boundary_Objects_Amateurs_and_Professionals_in_Berkeley's_Museum_of_Vertebrate_Zoology","305326540_Anthropological_Approaches_in_Mathematics_Education_French_Perspectives","286200349_Reflections_of_the_state_of_and_trends_in_research_on_mathematics_teaching_and_learning_From_here_to_utopia","276934605_Activity_theory_and_individual_and_social_transformation","265092184_Constructionism_in_Practice_Designing_Thinking_and_Learning_in_a_Digital_World","262008066_Institutional_Ecology_Translations'_and_Boundary_Objects_Amateurs_and_Professionals_in_Berkeley's_Museum_of_Vertebrate_Zoology_1907-39","256844587_Collected_Papers","248072272_Theory_of_Didactical_Situations_in_Mathematics","247535267_Situated_Learning_Legitimate_Peripheral","246677993_Les_Hommes_et_les_Technologies_Approche_Cognitive_des_Instruments_Contemporains","246676294_Situated_Learning_Legitimate_Peripheral_Practice","243764407_Language_as_Social_Semiotic_The_Social_Interpretation_of_Language_and_Meaning","229068230_Mind_in_society_The_development_of_higher_mental_processes","225811356_Cognition_and_artifacts_A_contribution_to_the_study_of_though_in_relation_to_instrumented_activity","225143092_Connecting_and_Integrating_Theoretical_Frames_The_TELMA_Contribution","220041424_Mind_in_Society_The_Development_of_Higher_Psychological_Functions","220040555_Situated_Learning_Legitimate_Peripheral_Participation","215439675_Activity_Consciousness_Personality"]}
