{"id":"298796657_Hybrid_control_on_bifurcation_for_a_delayed_fractional_gene_regulatory_network","abstract":"A novel delayed fractional-order gene regulatory network model is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the sum of delays is chosen as the bifurcation parameter, the conditions of the existence for the Hopf bifurcation are obtained by analyzing the associated characteristic equation. Then, it is the first time that a hybrid controller is designed to control the Hopf bifurcation for the proposed network. It is demonstrated that both fractional order and feedback gain can effectively control the dynamics of such network, the stability domain can be extended under the small fractional order or feedback gain. The controller is enough to delay the onset of the Hopf bifurcation and achieve some desirable dynamical behaviors by changing the appropriate order or feedback gain. Finally, numerical simulations are employed to justify the validity of our theoretical analysis.","authors":["Chengdai Huang","Jinde Cao","Min Xiao"],"meta":["June 2016Chaos Solitons & Fractals 87:19-29","DOI:10.1016/j.chaos.2016.02.036"],"references":["325256573_Evolutionary_games_on_multilayer_networks_A_colloquium","278792026_Effects_of_time_delay_and_space_on_herbivore_dynamics_Linking_inducible_defenses_of_plants_to_herbivore_outbreak","273510484_Application_of_a_normalized_difference_impervious_index_NDII_to_extract_urban_impervious_surface_features_based_on_Landsat_TM_images","264050371_An_Extended_Fractional_Kalman_Filter_for_Inferring_Gene_Regulatory_Networks_Using_Time-series_Data","257633648_Hopf_bifurcation_and_chaos_in_fractional-order_modified_hybrid_optical_system","257633397_Hopf_bifurcation_for_a_class_of_fractional_differential_equations_with_delay","245538900_A_Predictor-Corrector_Scheme_For_Solving_Nonlinear_Delay_Differential_Equations_Of_Fractional_Order","242999642_Stability_and_Hopf_bifurcation_of_a_class_of_TCPAQM_networks","231089335_Synchronization_transitions_on_small-world_neuronal_networks_Effects_of_information_transmission_delay_and_rewiring_probability","227716725_Complex_synchronous_behavior_in_interneuronal_networks_with_delayed_inhibitory_and_fast_electrical_synapses","226008286_Stability_analysis_of_linear_fractional_differential_system_with_multiple_time_delays","222132702_Fractional_calculus_models_of_complex_dynamics_in_biological_tissues","26330224_Delay-induced_multiple_stochastic_resonances_on_scale-free_neuronal_networks","15318143_The_fractional-order_dynamics_of_brainstem_vestibulo-oculomotor_neurons","303149485_Delay-induced_multiple_stochastic_resonances_on_scale-free_neuronal_networks_Chaos_An_Interdisciplinary","277084066_Undamped_Oscillations_Generated_by_Hopf_Bifurcations_in_Fractional-Order_Recurrent_Neural_Networks_With_Caputo_Derivative","275103828_Mittag-Leffler_stability_and_generalized_Mittag-Leffler_stability_of_fractional-order_gene_regulatory_networks","271952114_Hopf_bifurcation_analysis_of_a_new_commensurate_fractional-order_hyperchaotic_system","271455336_Fractional-order_delayed_predator-prey_systems_with_Holling_type-II_functional_response","264090128_Stability_and_bifurcation_of_genetic_regulatory_networks_with_small_RNAs_and_multiple_delays","260712001_Intercellular_Delay_Regulates_the_Collective_Period_of_Repressively_Coupled_Gene_Regulatory_Oscillator_Networks","259140890_Influence_of_time_delay_and_nonlinear_diffusion_on_herbivore_outbreak","258815441_Stability_and_Hopf_bifurcation_control_of_a_fractional-order_small_world_network_model","257590689_Stability_of_delay_induced_oscillations_in_gene_expression_of_Hes1_protein_model","257412984_Introduction","251678387_Robust_stability_for_discrete-time_stochastic_genetic_regulatory_networks","251584171_Kinetic_models_of_gene_expression_including_non-coding_RNAs","245431823_The_fractional_order_state_equations_for_the_control_of_viscoelastically_damped_structures","239943665_Decelerated_invasion_and_waning-moon_patterns_in_public_goods_games_with_delayed_distribution","237082792_Collective_behavior_and_evolutionary_games_-_An_introduction_Chaos_Solit","230929683_A_Novel_Exact_Representation_of_Stationary_Colored_Gaussian_Processes_Fractional_Differential_Approach","229337969_An_analog_simulation_of_non-integer_order_transfer_functions_for_analysis_of_electrode_processes","229272890_Hopf_bifurcation_analysis_for_a_model_of_genetic_regulatory_system_with_delay","228955588_Stability_and_Hopf_bifurcation_in_a_delayed_competition_system","222555175_Delayed_feedback-based_bifurcation_control_in_an_Internet_congestion_model","222552276_Hopf_bifurcation_in_a_DDE_model_of_gene_expression","222375194_Oscillatory_dynamics_in_a_simple_gene_regulatory_network_mediated_by_small_RNAs","222066935_Hybrid_control_of_period-doubling_bifurcation_and_chaos_in_discrete_nonlinear_dynamical_systems","221608586_Modelling_gene_regulatory_network_by_fractional_order_differential_equations","220552636_Anti-control_of_Hopf_bifurcation_for_Chen's_system_through_washout_filters","12654724_Elowitz_MB_Leibler_S_A_synthetic_oscillatory_network_of_transcriptional_regulators_Nature_403_335-338","7827600_Gottesman_S_Micros_for_microbes_non-coding_regulatory_RNAs_in_bacteria_Trends_Genet_21_399-404","3304635_On_the_role_of_fractional_calculus_in_electromagnetic_theory","3029982_Linear_approximation_of_transfer_function_with_a_pole_of_fractional_power"]}
