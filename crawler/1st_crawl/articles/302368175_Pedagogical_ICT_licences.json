{"id":"302368175_Pedagogical_ICT_licences","abstract":"The pedagogical ICT licence is an in-service training means for teachers combining pedagogical knowledge of ICT integration with basic ICT skills training. It is our philosophy that skilling teachers with one without the other makes the training useless.\nThe pedagogical ICT licence is a course concept that offers educators basic ICT skills on a personal and a professional level by focusing on the pedagogical integration of ICT in teaching practice. Using ideas from problem-based learning, team-based activities, peer-teaching and critical respons, together with principles for e-learning, we have managed to create a course concept that has been used by more than 35,000 (1/3 of all) teachers and educators in Denmark over a period of three years. Although the licence is not a compulsory education, it has become a formal and nationally recognised certificate.\nThis massive adoption of the course has only been possible by designing also a distributed course organisation that has two advantages: 1) it moves the actual implementation of the courses away from central government and thus we can handle more people at the same time, 2) the implementation of the courses becomes regional or local which means a higher commitment from all parties.\nOriginally the course concept was developed for teachers in compulsory education. However, the model has proven sufficiently robust to allow localisation into (so far) an additional seven educational areas within Denmark — and to be selected for localisation in Norway for both compulsory and upper secondary education.","authors":["Ulla Gjørling"],"meta":["January 2002","DOI:10.1007/978-0-387-35615-0_10","In book: TelE-Learning (pp.77-84)"],"references":[]}
