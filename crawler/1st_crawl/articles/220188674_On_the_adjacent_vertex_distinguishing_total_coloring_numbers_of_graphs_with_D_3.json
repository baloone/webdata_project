The minimum number of colors χa″(G) required to give G an adjacent vertex distinguishing total-coloring is studied. We proved χa″(G)⩽6 for graphs with maximum degree Δ(G)=3 in this paper.","authors":["Xiang'en Chen"],"meta":["September 2008Discrete Mathematics 308(17):4003-4007","DOI:10.1016/j.disc.2007.07.091","SourceDBLP"],"references":["264957055_Adjacent_Vertex_Distinguishing_Edge-Colorings","267008664_Graph_Theory_With_Application","265354457_Total_Colourings_of_Graphs","259307326_On_adjacent-vertex-distinguishing_total_coloring_of_graphs","223223049_On_the_Vertex-Distinguishing_Proper_Edge-Colorings_of_Graphs","222656920_D300_is_a_bound_on_the_adjacent_vertex_distinguishing_edge_chromatic_number","220318984_Adjacent_strong_edge_coloring_of_graphs","220191934_r-Strong_edge_colorings_of_graphs","220089389_On_the_adjacent_vertex-distinguishing_total_chromatic_numbers_of_the_graphs_with_D_G_3"]}
