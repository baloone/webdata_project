{"id":"348714468_Course_Content_as_a_Tool_of_Inclusivity_for_BlackAfrican-American_Women_in_Computing","abstract":"Promoting inclusion and increasing the representation of women in the field of Computer Science (CS) has been an ongoing initiative. When it comes to Black/African-American (AA) women, their under-representation in CS is even more disproportionate. CS is ever-evolving, but its ability to be perceived as a field with a breadth of spaces that reflects its potential to be inclusive-to-all has been a continuing challenge. Using course content to provide spaces for under-represented groups, like Black/AA women, to express their personal interests as they develop their computational competencies can help in addressing such potential in CS. This article discusses a two-year study conducted on 51 Black-/AA female students enrolled in an introductory and/or intermediate CS course at a historically black university in the mid-Atlantic United States. A final project was administered in both courses to allow these * 151 students to choose their own original problem to solve while showcas-ing their learned computational knowledge and developed programming competencies. The results revealed that 93% of the project topics chosen by these students exhibited people-centered orientations in nature. Furthermore, these outcomes reflect the potential nature for CS to be a field that can provide a breadth of spaces that reflect one's interest while also promoting inclusion.","authors":["Edward C.
