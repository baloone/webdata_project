{"id":"281050442_Exploring_Collective_Architectural_Conception_Cooperation_Coordination_and_Collaboration_via_Basic_Online_Tools","abstract":"Online technologies are already fully integrated into almost every domain of activity. We want to better understand if and how these tools assist groups of people in their architectural conception process. By looking at cooperation, collaboration and coordination moments from the architecturological point of view we hope to associate cognitive operations of conception to the use of certain online tools. The purpose of this research is to build a theoretical model of the collective architectural conception process in relation to the use of basic online tools.","authors":["Alexandru Senciuc","Caroline Lecourtois","Yuhua Luo"],"meta":["September 2013","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-40840-3_8","Conference: International Conference on Cooperative Design, Visualization and Engineering"],"references":["290651941_Architecturological_and_epistemological_research_on_collaborative_design","267923338_Conception_et_cooperation","236221949_Changing_the_World_One_Webpage_at_a_Time_Conceptualizing_and_Explaining_'Internet_Activism'","222838845_Collaborative_design_What_is_it","222184024_Cooperation_dialogue_and_ethics","38279418_Sciences_des_systemes_sciences_de_l'artificiel"]}
