{"id":"267809496_Comparing_UCT_versus_CFR_in_simultaneous_games","abstract":"Simultaneous move games where all the player have to take their actions simultaneously are a class of games in general game playing. In this paper we analyze how UCT performs in this class of games. We argue that UCT does not converge to a Nash equilibrium in general and the situation that it con-verges to can be exploited. We also analyze CFR (CounterFactual Regret) and show how it can be used to exploit UCT.","authors":["Mohammad Shafiei","Nathan Sturtevant","Jonathan Schaeffer"],"meta":["January 2009"],"references":[]}
