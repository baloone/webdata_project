{"id":"330287762_Fuzzy_Graph_Structures_with_Application","abstract":"In this article, we introduce the notions of maximal products of fuzzy graph structures, regular fuzzy graph structures, and describe these notions with examples and properties. Further, we present the degree and total degree of a vertex in maximal product of fuzzy graph structures and explain some of their properties. Furthermore, we develop a flowchart to show general procedure of application of fuzzy graph structure, regarding identification of most controversial issues among countries.","authors":["Muzzamal Sitara","Muhammad Akram","Muhammad Yousaf"],"meta":["January 2019","DOI:10.3390/math7010063"],"references":["327689068_A_New_Method_to_Decision-Making_with_Fuzzy_Competition_Hypergraphs","314510989_Certain_Concepts_of_Bipolar_Fuzzy_Directed_Hypergraphs","286903464_Operations_on_Soft_Graphs","267127400_On_generalised_fuzzy_graph_structures","266986246_Some_sequences_in_fuzzy_graphs","266074781_Generalized_graph_structures","317429684_FUZZY_GRAPH_STRUCTURE_OF_FLOWER_GRAPHS","285264036_Fuzzy_Graphs_Fuzzy_Sets_and_their_Applications","268550632_Fuzzy_graphs","265629445_Fuzzy_graphs_and_fuzzy_hypergraphs"]}
