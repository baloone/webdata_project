{"id":"318243943_Good_Practice_Proposal_for_the_Implementation_Presentation_and_Comparison_of_Metaheuristics_for_Solving_Routing_Problems","abstract":"Researchers who investigate in any area related to computational algorithms (both defining new algorithms or improving existing ones) usually find large difficulties to test their work. Comparisons among different researches in this field are often a hard task, due to the ambiguity or lack of detail in the presentation of the work and its results. On many occasions, the replication of the work conducted by other researchers is required, which leads to a waste of time and a delay in the research advances. The authors of this study propose a procedure to introduce new techniques and their results in the field of routing problems. In this paper this procedure is detailed, and a set of good practices to follow are deeply described. It is noteworthy that this procedure can be applied to any combinatorial optimization problem. Anyway, the literature of this study is focused on routing problems. This field has been chosen because of its importance in real world, and its relevance in the actual literature.","authors":["Eneko Osaba","Roberto Carballedo","F.
