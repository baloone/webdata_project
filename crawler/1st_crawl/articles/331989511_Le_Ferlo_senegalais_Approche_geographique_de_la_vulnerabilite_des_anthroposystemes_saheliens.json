{"id":"331989511_Le_Ferlo_senegalais_Approche_geographique_de_la_vulnerabilite_des_anthroposystemes_saheliens","abstract":"The pastoral anthroposystem of Senegalese Ferlo evolves in an environment historically neglected by agricultural policies because of its characteristics particular biophysics, unfavorable to the agriculture and to the shape of development other than the extensive breeding. This primacy of the itinerant breeding is nowadays more and more disputed by the development of the farming in a context marked by the improvement of the conditions of the rainfall in West-African Sahel, soil depletion in the Groundnut Basin and the multiplication of agricultural development at the valley of the Senegal River. By combining the analysis of remote sensing imagery for mapping land cover changes by the vegetation cover, the study of flora and vegetation landscape and the exploitation of the investigations in villages and camps, this thesis attempts to define the geography of the vulnerability of rural populations and ecosystems which they use. So, pastoralists evolve with daily adaptation strategies in these circles inside Senegal marked by deep ecological instability and by the transformations at work in the Senegalese rural society. These socio-environmental changes contribute to the dynamics of plant landscapes and raise the question of ecosystem degradation.","authors":["Ababacar FALL"],"meta":["October 2014","Thesis for: DoctoratAdvisor: Frederic ALEXANDRE","Project: ANR ECLIS (Elevage, Climat et Sociétés) : Etude de la contribution de l’élevage à la réduction de la vulnérabilité des ruraux et à leur adaptabilité aux changements climatiques et sociétaux en Afrique sub-saharienne (2008-2012)."],"references":[]}
