{"id":"350204548_The_effectiveness_of_GitHub_cloud_services_for_implementing_a_programming_training_project_students'_point_of_view","abstract":"In todayâ€™s IT industry, it is important to develop the ability of IT students to collaboratively develop software, professional and personal skills. An effective method for developing such skills in future IT specialists is to organize different types of educational projects related to different programming technologies during the execution of mini projects, group and individual project assignments, term papers, academic training within the academic disciplines. The paper summarizes the results of a pedagogical study involving 29 expert students who study Computer Science and Software Engineering and used cloud service for GitHub collaborative IT development projects. The research findings testify, the most effective characteristics of this service, according to experts, identified the possibility of collaborative development of software (i1), the convenience of bug tracking (i3) and the convenience of the code editor (i7). It offers examples and results of using GitHub cloud service in the process of executing educational projects by future IT specialists.","authors":["Olena Glazunova","O V Parhomenko","Valentyna I.
