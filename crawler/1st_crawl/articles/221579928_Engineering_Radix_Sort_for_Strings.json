{"id":"221579928_Engineering_Radix_Sort_for_Strings","abstract":"We describe new implementations of MSD radix sort for efficiently sorting large collections of strings. Our implementations\nare significantly faster than previous MSD radix sort implementations, and in fact faster than any other string sorting algorithm \non several data sets. We also describe a new variant that achieves high space-efficiency at a small additional cost on runtime.","authors":["Juha Kärkkäinen","Tommi Rantala"],"meta":["November 2008","DOI:10.1007/978-3-540-89097-3_3","SourceDBLP","Conference: String Processing and Information Retrieval, 15th International Symposium, SPIRE 2008, Melbourne, Australia, November 10-12, 2008.
