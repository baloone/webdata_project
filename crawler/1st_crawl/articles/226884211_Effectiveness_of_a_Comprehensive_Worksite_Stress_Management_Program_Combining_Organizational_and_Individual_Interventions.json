{"id":"226884211_Effectiveness_of_a_Comprehensive_Worksite_Stress_Management_Program_Combining_Organizational_and_Individual_Interventions","abstract":"A comprehensive worksite stress management program consisting of self-management training and a stressor reduction process was evaluated in a pre-post, treatment-control design in four comparable facilities. Results showed that over a 3-month period those individuals attending self-management training improved on emotional well-being measures. Organizational data suggested that their work-units' productivity increased and absenteeism decreased over the same period. Results support the value of combining self-management training and stressor reduction to produce positive individual and organizational outcomes.","authors":["David C. Munz","Jennifer M.
