{"id":"256059952_Two-Step_Estimation_of_Network-Formation_Models_with_Incomplete_Information","abstract":"We characterize network formation as a simultaneous game of incomplete information. The model allows linking decisions to depend on the structure of the network as well as the characteristics of agents, thereby generalizing dyadic regression. When the data is rationalized by an anonymous equilibrium, meaning observationally identical agents choose the same ex-ante strategies, the model can be estimated using a computationally simple two-step procedure. Estimation is possible with only a single network because the frequency with which different types of agents link provides identifying variation. Under a sequence of experiments that sends the number of agents in the network n to infinity, our estimator is consistent at the parametric rate n when types are discrete and at a slower nonparametric rate when types are continuous. We apply the model to study the formation of risk-sharing networks in rural Indian villages.","authors":["Michael P.
