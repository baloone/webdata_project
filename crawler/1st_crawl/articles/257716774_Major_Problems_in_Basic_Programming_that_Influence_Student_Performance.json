{"id":"257716774_Major_Problems_in_Basic_Programming_that_Influence_Student_Performance","abstract":"Programming is an important basic skill for computer science students. However, most students found it is hard to learn and score a good mark. This paper discusses the study to identify problems and causes faced by programming students. The study was conducted at the Faculty of Information Science and Technology, UKM. Data was collected from 179 students who answered on–line questionnaire. The study identified several major problems; reference materials, lectures and lab session approaches, problem solving ability, time management and self-confidence. The findings will be used to improve the courses and thus ensures the realization of course outcomes, decrease the failure rates and increase student's interest in programming.","authors":["Masura Rahmat","Shahrina Shahrani","Rodziah Latih","Noor Faezah Mohd Yatim"],"meta":["October 2012Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences 59:287–296","DOI:10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.09.277"],"references":["228328491_Learning_to_program_-_difficulties_and_solutions","238673661_Roboprof_and_an_introductory_programming_course","234814198_Programming_pedagogy-A_psychological_overview","228465660_On_the_difficulty_of_learning_to_program","220808410_The_motivation_of_students_of_programming","220808132_RoboProf_and_an_introductory_computer_programming_course","220426367_Learning_to_Program_and_Learning_to_Think_What's_the_Connection"]}
