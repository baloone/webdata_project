{"id":"280695940_Multimodal_Factor_Analysis","abstract":"A multimodal system with Poisson, Gaussian, and multinomial observations is\nconsidered. A generative graphical model that combines multiple modalities\nthrough common factor loadings is proposed. In this model, latent factors are\nlike summary objects that has latent factor scores in each modality, and the\nobserved objects are represented in terms of such summary objects. This\npotentially brings about a significant dimensionality reduction. It also\nnaturally enables a powerful means of clustering based on a diverse set of\nobservations. An expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to find the model\nparameters is provided. The algorithm is tested on a Twitter dataset which\nconsists of the counts and geographical coordinates of hashtag occurrences,\ntogether with the bag of words for each hashtag. The resultant factors\nsuccessfully localizes the hashtags in all dimensions: counts, coordinates,\ntopics. The algorithm is also extended to accommodate von Mises-Fisher\ndistribution, which is used to model the spherical coordinates.","authors":["Yasin Yilmaz","Alfred Hero"],"meta":["August 2015","SourcearXiv"],"references":["235216661_Optimal_Sequential_Joint_Detection_and_Estimation","221620547_Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation","221345149_Multimodal_Deep_Learning","220270112_Variational_Bounds_for_Mixed-Data_Factor_Analysis","51965593_Beta-Negative_Binomial_Process_and_Poisson_Factor_Analysis","10710612_Estimating_a_State-Space_Model_from_Point_Process_Observations","262157385_Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation","220319974_Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation","24052099_Multinomial_logistic_regression_algorithm"]}
