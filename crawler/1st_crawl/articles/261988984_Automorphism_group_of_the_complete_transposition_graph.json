{"id":"261988984_Automorphism_group_of_the_complete_transposition_graph","abstract":"The complete transposition graph is defined to be the graph whose vertices\nare the elements of the symmetric group $S_n$, and two vertices $\\alpha$ and\n$\\beta$ are adjacent in this graph iff there is some transposition $(i,j)$ such\nthat $\\alpha=(i,j) \\beta$. Thus, the complete transposition graph is the Cayley\ngraph $\\Cay(S_n,S)$ of the symmetric group generated by the set $S$ of all\ntranspositions. An open problem in the literature is to determine which Cayley\ngraphs are normal. It was shown recently that the Cayley graph generated by 4\ncyclically adjacent transpositions is not normal. In the present paper, it is\nproved that the complete transposition graph is not a normal Cayley graph, for\nall $n \\ge 3$. Furthermore, the automorphism group of the complete\ntransposition graph is shown to equal \\[ \\Aut(\\Cay(S_n,S)) = (R(S_n) \\rtimes\n\\Inn(S_n)) \\rtimes \\mathbb{Z}_2, \\] where $R(S_n)$ is the right regular\nrepresentation of $S_n$, $\\Inn(S_n)$ is the group of inner automorphisms of\n$S_n$, and $\\mathbb{Z}_2 = \\langle h \\rangle$, where $h$ is the map $\\alpha\n\\mapsto \\alpha^{-1}$.","authors":["Ashwin Ganesan"],"meta":["April 2014Journal of Algebraic Combinatorics 42(3)","DOI:10.1007/s10801-015-0602-5","SourcearXiv","Project: Automorphism groups of Cayley graphs"],"references":["235410068_Algebraic_Graph_Theory","344486874_Group_Theory_I","336906859_Connectivity_in_Graphs","265427606_Connectivity_in_Graphs","238711642_Congruent_Graphs_and_the_Connectivity_of_Graphs","225044280_Automorphism_groups_of_Cayley_graphs_generated_by_connected_transposition_sets","222283801_Automorphism_groups_and_isomorphisms_of_Cayley_digraphs","221932947_Algebraic_Graph_Theory","220568910_Bisection_Width_of_Transposition_Graphs","220442195_On_the_full_automorphism_group_of_Cayley_graphs"]}
