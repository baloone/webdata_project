{"id":"282238667_Equilibrium_threshold_strategies_The_case_of_queues_with_priorities","abstract":"Multiplicity of solutions is typical for systems where the individual's tendency to act in a certain way increases when more of the other individuals in the population act in this way. We provide a detailed analysis of a queueing model in which two priority levels can be purchased. In particular, we compute all of the Nash equilibrium strategies (pure and mixed) of the threshold type.","authors":["R.
