{"id":"274012141_Some_superconcentration_inequalities_for_extrema_of_stationary_Gaussian_Processes","abstract":"This note is concerned with concentration inequalities for extrema of\nstationary Gaussian processes. It provides non-asymptotic tail inequalities\nwhich fully reflect the fluctuation rate, and as such improve upon standard\nGaussian concentration. The arguments rely on the hypercontractive approach\ndeveloped by Chatterjee for superconcentration variance bounds. Some\nstatistical illustrations complete the exposition.","authors":["Kevin Tanguy"],"meta":["March 2015Statistics & Probability Letters 106","DOI:10.1016/j.spl.2015.07.028","SourcearXiv"],"references":["273704105_Convergence_of_the_centered_maximum_of_log-correlated_Gaussian_fields","264122781_Log-correlated_Gaussian_fields_an_overview","258345854_Tightness_of_the_recentered_maximum_of_log-correlated_Gaussian_fields","316501728_Log-correlated_Gaussian_Fields_An_Overview","299674827_Symmetric_Markov_Diffusion_Operators","279833448_Markov_semigroups_at_Saint-Flour","271513016_Extremes_and_Related_Properties_of_Random_Sequences_and_Processes","267678345_Superconcentration_and_Related_Topics","265480183_Analysis_and_Geometry_of_Markov_Diffusion_Operators","259578159_Subdiffusive_concentration_in_first-passage_percolation"]}
