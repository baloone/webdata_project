{"id":"345658544_Safe_number_and_integrity_of_graphs","abstract":"For a connected graph G=(V(G),E(G)), a non-empty subset S of V(G) is a safe set if, for every component C of G[S] and every component D of G−S, we have |V(C)|≥|V(D)| whenever there exists an edge of G between C and D. If G[S] is connected, then S is called a connected safe set. The safe number s(G) of G is defined as s(G)≔min{|S|:S is a safe set of G}, and the connected safe number cs(G) of G is defined as cs(G)≔min{|S|:S is a connected safe set of G}. The integrity of a graph G is defined as I(G)≔min{|S|+τ(G−S):S⊆V(G)}, where τ(G−S) is the order of the largest component of G−S.\nIn this paper, we discuss a relationship between the (connected) safe number and the integrity in a connected graph.","authors":["Shinya Fujita","Michitaka Furuya"],"meta":["October 2018Discrete Applied Mathematics 247:398-406","DOI:10.1016/j.dam.2018.03.074"],"references":[]}
