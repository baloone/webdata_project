{"id":"226210367_Syntactical_and_Semantical_Aspects_of_Faust","abstract":"This paper presents some syntactical and semantical aspects of FAUST (Functional AUdio STreams), a programming language for real-time sound processing and synthesis. The programming model of FAUST combines two approaches: functional programming and block-diagrams composition. It is based on a block-diagram algebra. It as a well defined formal semantic and can be compiled into efficient C/C++ code.","authors":["Yann Orlarey","Dominique Fober","Stephane Letz"],"meta":["September 2004Soft Computing 8(9):623-632","DOI:10.1007/s00500-004-0388-1"],"references":["260685566_Dataflow_Process_Networks","260402282_An_Algebra_for_Block_Diagram_Languages","252065115_The_Semantics_of_a_Simple_Language_for_Parallel_Processing","234798121_A_computer_architecture_for_highly_parallel_signal_processing","230554884_Digital_Synthesis_of_Plucked-String_and_Drum_Timbres","221329680_The_Semantics_of_Simple_Language_for_Parallel_Programming","220197264_A_Survey_of_Stream_Processing","2760235_Stream_Processing_I_A_Survey","2606985_Algebra_of_Flownomials_Part_1_Binary_Flownomials_Basic_Theory"]}
