{"id":"321859804_The_Wiener_index_of_Sierpinski-like_graphs","abstract":"Sierpiński-like graphs constitute an extensively studied family of graphs of fractal nature applicable in topology, mathematics of the Tower of Hanoi, computer science, and elsewhere. In this paper, we focus on the Wiener polarity index, Wiener index and Harary index of Sierpiński-like graphs. By Sierpiński-like graphs’ special structure and correlation, their Wiener polarity index and some Sierpiński-like graph’s Wiener index and Harary index are obtained. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature","authors":["Chunmei Luo","Liancui Zuo","Philip B.
