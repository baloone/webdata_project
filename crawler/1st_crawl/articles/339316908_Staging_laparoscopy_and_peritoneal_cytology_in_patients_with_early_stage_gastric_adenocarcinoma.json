The yield of peritoneal staging in patients with early stage disease is lacking. We assess the yield of peritoneal staging in early stage gastric cancer and its impact on survival.\n\nMethods: \nData were obtained from a prospective database of patients who underwent staging laparoscopy and peritoneal cytology for gastric cancer at our institution between July 1995 and July 2018. Clinical stage was determined by endoscopic ultrasound, and early stage was defined as cT1-2 and cN0. Rates of positive cytology and carcinomatosis at time of laparoscopy were obtained. Univariate analyses were used to compare groups, and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were used to assess survival outcomes.\n\nResults: \nEight hundred sixty-seven patients underwent staging laparoscopy and peritoneal cytology; 56 were defined as early stage. Age was 61 Â± 12 years, 66.4% were male, and 62.3% were white. Of the patients with early stage disease, 17.9% had either gross carcinomatosis (10.7%) and/or positive peritoneal cytology (10.9%). All cases of peritoneal disease were in patients with cT2 disease. There were no differences in age, gender, or race based on peritoneal disease (all p > 0.05). The presence of carcinomatosis or positive cytology significantly affected overall survival (p < 0.001), regardless of clinical T or N stage.\n\nConclusions: \nPeritoneal staging identifies metastatic disease in a significant number of patients with early stage disease. Given its poor prognosis and alternate therapy options, independent staging laparoscopy and peritoneal cytology should be considered in patients with early stage gastric adenocarcinoma.","authors":["Casey J Allen","Alisa N.
