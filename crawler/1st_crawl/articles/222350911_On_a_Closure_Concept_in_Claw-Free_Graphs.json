{"id":"222350911_On_a_Closure_Concept_in_Claw-Free_Graphs","abstract":"IfGis a claw-free graph, then there is a graphcl(G) such that (i) Gis a spanning subgraph ofcl(G), (ii) cl(G) is a line graph of a triangle-free graph, and (iii) the length of a longest cycle inGand incl(G) is the same. A sufficient condition for hamiltonicity in claw-free graphs, the equivalence of some conjectures on hamiltonicity in 2-tough graphs and the hamiltonicity of 7-connected claw-free graphs are obtained as corollaries.","authors":["Zdeněk Ryjáček"],"meta":["July 1997Journal of Combinatorial Theory Series B 70(2):217-224","DOI:10.1006/jctb.1996.1732","SourceDBLP"],"references":["220620541_Local_Connectivity_and_Cycle_Extension_in_Claw-Free_Graphs","313005197_Hamiltonian_results_in_K13-free_graphs","276169042_Graph_Theory_With_Applications","271512783_Graph_Theory_and_Applications","267008664_Graph_Theory_With_Application","229766208_Hamiltonian_circuits_in_N2-locally_connected_K13-free_graphs","229759552_Hamiltonian_Results_in_K13-free_Graphs","229708678_Every_connected_locally_connected_nontrivial_graph_with_no_induced_claw_is_Hamiltonian","227802796_Toughness_and_the_existence_of_k-Factors","227736953_Reflections_on_graph_theory","220187061_On_hamiltonian_line_graphs_and_connectivity"]}
