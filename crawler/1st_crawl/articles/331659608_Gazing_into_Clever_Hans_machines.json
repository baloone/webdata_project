{"id":"331659608_Gazing_into_Clever_Hans_machines","abstract":"Humans infer much of the intentions of others by just looking at their gaze. Similarly, we want to understand how machine learning systems solve a problem. New tools are developed to find out what strategies a learning machine is using, such as what it is paying attention to when classifying images.","authors":["Jose Hernandez-Orallo"],"meta":["March 2019Nature Machine Intelligence 1(4):1","DOI:10.1038/s42256-019-0032-5"],"references":["331397043_Unmasking_Clever_Hans_Predictors_and_Assessing_What_Machines_Really_Learn","326381669_Large-Scale_High-Resolution_Comparison_of_the_Core_Visual_Object_Recognition_Behavior_of_Humans_Monkeys_and_State-of-the-Art_Deep_Artificial_Neural_Networks","277248670_On_Pixel-Wise_Explanations_for_Non-Linear_Classifier_Decisions_by_Layer-Wise_Relevance_Propagation","5610050_Strategies_in_subtraction_solving_in_children","265645782_A_Simple_Method_to_Determine_if_a_Music_Information_Retrieval_System_is_a_Horse"]}
