{"id":"281084095_Reachability_Problems_for_Continuous_Chemical_Reaction_Networks","abstract":"Chemical reaction networks (CRNs) model the behavior of molecules in a\nwell-mixed system. The emerging field of molecular programming uses CRNs not\nonly as a descriptive tool, but as a programming language for chemical\ncomputation. Recently, Chen, Doty and Soloveichik introduced a new model of\nchemical kinetics, rate-independent continuous CRNs (CCRNs), to study the\nchemical computation of continuous functions. A fundamental question of a CRN\nis whether a state of the system is reachable through a sequence of reactions\nin the network. This is known as the reachability problem. In this paper, we\ninvestigate CCRN-REACH, the reachability problem for this model of chemical\nreaction networks. We show that, for continuous CRNs, constructing a path to a\nstate of the network is computable in polynomial time. We also prove that a\nrelated problem, Sub-CCRN-REACH, is NP-complete.","authors":["Adam Case","Jack H. Lutz","D.M.
