In order to train the network to de-noise phase fringe patterns, a database is constituted with a set of noise-free and noisy phase data corresponding to realistic decorrelation phase noise conditions. An iterative scheme coupled with an input noise level estimator allows improving the deep learning based approach especially for strong noise. Performance of the trained network is estimated and shows that this approach is close to the state-of-the-art of speckle de-noising in digital holographic phase measurements.","authors":["Silvio Montr√©sor","Marie Tahon","Antoine Laurent","Pascal Picart"],"meta":["June 2020","DOI:10.1364/DH.2020.HTu4B.4","Conference: Digital Holography and Three-Dimensional Imaging 2020At: Vancouver","Project: Image Processing applied to Digital Holography"],"references":["331383859_Computational_image_speckle_suppression_using_block_matching_and_machine_learning","329002482_Dictionary_Learning_Phase_Retrieval_from_Noisy_Diffraction_Patterns","328032548_Speckle_noise_reduction_in_optical_coherence_tomography_images_based_on_edge-sensitive_cGAN","326225792_Strategies_for_reducing_speckle_noise_in_digital_holography_ACCEPTED_ARTICLE_PREVIEW","308692568_Low-dose_CT_via_convolutional_neural_network","306187437_Beyond_a_Gaussian_Denoiser_Residual_Learning_of_Deep_CNN_for_Image_Denoising","277411157_Deep_Learning","333179971_DeepLSR_a_deep_learning_approach_for_laser_speckle_reduction","331026898_Cycle-consistent_deep_learning_approach_to_coherent_noise_reduction_in_optical_diffraction_tomography","329832470_Fringe_pattern_denoising_based_on_deep_learning","327455383_Hyperspectral_Image_Denoising_Employing_a_Spatial-Spectral_Deep_Residual_Convolutional_Neural_Network","313747180_Error_analysis_for_noise_reduction_in_3D_deformation_measurement_with_digital_color_holography"]}
