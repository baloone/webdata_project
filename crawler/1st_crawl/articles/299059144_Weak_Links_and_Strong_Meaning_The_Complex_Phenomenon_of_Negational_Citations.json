{"id":"299059144_Weak_Links_and_Strong_Meaning_The_Complex_Phenomenon_of_Negational_Citations","abstract":"The latest advances in research in the field of bibliometrics take into consideration in-text references. The purpose of this paper is to focus on citation contexts that express negational citations and which are relatively rare in articles. Our goal is to automate the extraction of negational citation contexts and to put them in relation to positions in the text progression of articles. After extracting sentences from the full text body of articles, we construct linguistic resources in order to identify some of the negational citation discursive patterns. We show the distribution of negational citations in the IMRaD structure. The identification of negational citations has numerous potential applications and might be used to improve information retrieval of scientific papers.","authors":["Marc Bertin","Iana Atanassova"],"meta":["March 2016","Conference: Bibliometrics-Enhanced Information Retrieval (BIR-2016), European Conference of Information Retrieval (ECIR)"],"references":["283293314_The_incidence_and_role_of_negative_citations_in_science","267983235_Scientometrics_and_Information_Retrieval_-_weak-links_revitalized","266210444_Citation_Resolution_A_method_for_evaluating_context-based_citation_recommendation_systems","262689913_Citation-based_Plagiarism_Detection_-_Detecting_Disguised_and_Cross-language_Plagiarism_using_Citation_Pattern_Analysis","262166051_Context-enhanced_citation_sentiment_detection","261557876_A_Study_of_Lexical_Distribution_in_Citation_Contexts_through_the_IMRaD_Standard","341925908_Some_Results_on_the_Function_and_Quality_of_Citations_Social_Studies_of_Science","279586896_The_Author_in_the_Text_Hedging_Scientific_Writing","269222949_The_Invariant_Distribution_of_References_in_Scientific_Articles","256082232_Improving_the_accuracy_of_co-citation_clustering_using_full_text"]}
