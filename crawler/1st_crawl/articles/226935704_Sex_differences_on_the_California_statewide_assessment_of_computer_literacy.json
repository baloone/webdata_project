Boys in both grades displayed consistently higher levels of achievement in nearly all curriculum objectives surveyed. Boys had more exposure to computers both at school and at home and tended to have more positive attitudes toward the role of computers in the workplace.","authors":["Mark Fetler"],"meta":["January 1985Sex Roles 13(3):181-191","DOI:10.1007/BF00287909"],"references":["348319957_Computer_Literacy-What_is_It","234639418_Computer_Literacy--What_Is_It","234598003_An_Introduction_to_Computing_Content_for_a_High_School_Course","35806796_A_place_called_school"]}
