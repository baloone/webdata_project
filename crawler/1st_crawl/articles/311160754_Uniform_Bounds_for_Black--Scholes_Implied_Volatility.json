{"id":"311160754_Uniform_Bounds_for_Black--Scholes_Implied_Volatility","abstract":"In this note, Black{Scholes implied volatility is expressed in terms of various optimization problems. From these representations, upper and lower bounds are derived which hold uniformly across mon- eyness and call price. Various symmetries of the Black{Scholes formula are exploited to derive new bounds from old. These bounds are used to reprove asymptotic formulas for implied volatility at extreme strikes and/or maturities.","authors":["Michael R.
