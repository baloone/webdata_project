{"id":"319349951_Non-asymptotic_variance_bounds_and_deviation_inequalities_by_optimal_transport","abstract":"The purpose of this note is to show how simple optimal transport arguments, on the real line, can be used in Superconcentration theory. As such, we derive non- asymptotic sharp variance bounds for various functionals (maximum, median, lp norms) of standard Gaussian random vectors. The flexibility of this approach can also provide exponential deviation inequalities reflecting preceding variance bounds. As a further illustration of the methodology, usual laws for extreme theory and Coulomb gases are studied.","authors":["Kevin Tanguy"],"meta":["August 2017ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF PROBABILITY 24(none)","DOI:10.1214/19-EJP265"],"references":["274012141_Some_superconcentration_inequalities_for_extrema_of_stationary_Gaussian_Processes","265142104_Extreme_Value_Theory_An_Introduction","257299283_A_Note_on_the_Second_Order_Universality_at_the_Edge_of_Coulomb_Gases_on_the_Plane","318035616_On_the_tightness_of_Gaussian_concentration_for_convex_functions","283279908_Random_version_of_Dvoretzky's_theorem_in_ell_pn","271513016_Extremes_and_Related_Properties_of_Random_Sequences_and_Processes","267678345_Superconcentration_and_Related_Topics","267128815_Concentration_Inequalities_A_nonasymptotic_theory_of_independence","265480183_Analysis_and_Geometry_of_Markov_Diffusion_Operators","259578159_Subdiffusive_concentration_in_first-passage_percolation"]}
