{"id":"265499443_2013_Intelligent_Examination_System_to_Support_Teacher's_Reflection_Measurement_of_Students'_Guided_Feedback","abstract":"Feedback on student performance is a critical part of E-learning environments. Assessment is one of the most important activities in education to evaluate the knowledge level of a student and to highlight the mistakes and misconceptions; especially, in Multiple Choices (MC) Exam which discovers the weak points of lesson in addition to prerequisite lessons. This paper proposes an Intelligent Examination Framework (I-EXAM), which includes two different types of adaptivity: a) Student receives immediate feedback during MC exam, b) Teacher monitors and tracks the students’ attempts and measure the effectiveness of his/her given feedback via a Visual Suggestion Refinement Tool (VSRT) using Data Mining Techniques. This type of analytical and diagnostic visual tool enables teachers to drill down from a high-level overview into the details of student activities, which ultimately allows enhancement of the concept map and the given feedbacks to match students’ needs.","authors":["Osama Badawy","Essam Kosba","P.
