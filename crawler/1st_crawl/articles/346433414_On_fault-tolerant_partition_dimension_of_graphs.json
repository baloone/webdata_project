{"id":"346433414_On_fault-tolerant_partition_dimension_of_graphs","abstract":"Fault-tolerant resolving partition is natural extension of resolving partitions which have many applications in different areas of computer sciences for example sensor networking, intelligent systems, optimization and robot navigation. For a nontrivial connected graph G (V (G) , E (G)), the partition representation of vertex v with respect to an ordered partition Π = {Si : 1 ≤ i ≤ k} of V (G) is the k-vector r ( v | Π ) = ( d ( v , S i ) ) i = 1 k , where, d (v, Si) = min {d (v, x) |x ∈ Si}, for i ∈ {1, 2, …, k}. A partition Π is said to be fault-tolerant partition resolving set of G if r (u|Π) and r (v|Π) differ by at least two places for all u ≠ v ∈ V (G). A fault-tolerant partition resolving set of minimum cardinality is called the fault-tolerant partition basis of G and its cardinality the fault-tolerant partition dimension of G denoted by P ( G ) . In this article, we will compute fault-tolerant partition dimension of families of tadpole and necklace graphs.","authors":["Kamran Azhar","Sohail Zafar","Agha Kashif Arshad Khan","Zohaib Zahid"],"meta":["October 2020Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems 40(1):1-7","DOI:10.3233/JIFS-201390"],"references":["338960903_The_locating-chromatic_number_and_partition_dimension_of_fibonacene_graphs","332443550_Metric_dimension_of_fullerene_graphs","330373946_Fault-Tolerant_Resolvability_and_Extremal_Structures_of_Graphs","328096023_Sharp_Bounds_for_partition_dimension_of_Generalized_Mobius_Ladder","326574158_On_partition_dimension_of_fullerene_graphs","323926479_The_partition_dimension_of_cycle_books_graph","289994441_The_Partition_Dimension_of_Some_Families_of_Trees","289994295_The_Partition_Dimension_of_a_Subdivision_of_a_Complete_Graph","266061233_On_Cycle_Related_Graphs_with_Constant_Metric_Dimension","259759032_Graphs_of_order_n_with_fault-tolerant_partition_dimension_n-1","259574039_Fault-Tolerant_Metric_and_Partition_Dimension_of_Graphs","350421737_FAULT-TOLERANT_METRIC_DIMENSION_OF_CIRCULANT_GRAPHS","345464414_Hybrid_Soft_Computing_Models_Applied_to_Graph_Theory","338982481_Fuzzy_Hypergraphs_and_Related_Extensions","327910718_On_the_k-partition_dimension_of_graphs","326929185_On_the_fault-tolerant_metric_dimension_of_convex_polytopes","319861713_The_partition_dimension_of_circulant_graphs","317770175_On_the_Partition_Dimension_of_Circulant_Graphs","303151748_Leaves_of_trees","283157318_Metric_in_Bipolar_Fuzzy_Graphs","264960330_On_the_metric_dimension_of_a_graph","260269274_On_the_partition_dimension_of_a_class_of_circulant_graphs","257252350_Distributed_Loop_Computer-Networks_A_Survey","250686251_The_partition_dimension_of_a_graph","223217500_Landmarks_in_graphs","222514864_Resolvability_in_graphs_and_the_metric_dimension_of_a_graph","220632415_Metric_bases_in_digital_geometry"]}
