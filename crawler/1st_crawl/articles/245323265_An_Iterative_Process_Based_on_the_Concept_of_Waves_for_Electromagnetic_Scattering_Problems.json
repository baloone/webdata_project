{"id":"245323265_An_Iterative_Process_Based_on_the_Concept_of_Waves_for_Electromagnetic_Scattering_Problems","abstract":"An iterative method based on the concept of waves is applied to the computation of the scattering behavior of spherical and cylindrical surfaces. An example of multiple scattering by N parallel circular conducting cylinders of arbitrary radius and distribution is also presented. The method allows a unified numerical solution procedure to be implemented for the foregoing hierarchy of the scatterers. Representative numerical results for a number of scattering geometries are given to illustrate the efficacy and the versatility of the present approach.","authors":["Rachida Bedira","A.
