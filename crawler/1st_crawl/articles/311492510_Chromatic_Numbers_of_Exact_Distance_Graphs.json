{"id":"311492510_Chromatic_Numbers_of_Exact_Distance_Graphs","abstract":"For any graph $G=(V,E)$ and positive integer $p$, the exact distance-$p$ graph $G^{[\\natural p]}$ is the graph with vertex set $V$, which has an edge between vertices $x$ and $y$ if and only if $x$ and $y$ have distance $p$ in $G$. For odd $p$, Ne\\v{s}et\\v{r}il and Ossona de Mendez proved that for any fixed graph class with bounded expansion, the chromatic number of $G^{[\\natural p]}$ is bounded by an absolute constant. Using the notion of generalised colouring numbers, we give a much simpler proof for the result of Ne\\v{s}et\\v{r}il and Ossona de Mendez, which at the same time gives significantly better bounds. In particular, we show that for any graph $G$ and odd positive integer $p$, the chromatic number of $G^{[\\natural p]}$ is bounded by the weak $(2p-1)$-colouring number of $G$. For even $p$, we prove that $\\chi(G^{[\\natural p]})$ is at most the weak $(2p)$-colouring number times the maximum degree. For odd $p$, the existing lower bound on the number of colours needed to colour $G^{[\\natural p]}$ when $G$ is planar is improved. Similar lower bounds are given for $K_t$-minor free graphs.","authors":["Jan van den Heuvel","H. A.
