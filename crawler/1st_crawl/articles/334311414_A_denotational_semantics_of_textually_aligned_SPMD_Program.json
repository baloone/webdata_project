{"id":"334311414_A_denotational_semantics_of_textually_aligned_SPMD_Program","abstract":"We discuss the benefit of enforcing textual alignment in programming languages proposing unstructured spmd-like collective operations. Our study is based on a simple language which provides support for global synchronization barriers. A formal definition of textual alignment, based on an operational semantics, is considered. We prove that this property entails the absence of deadlocks.. Finally, we provide a compositional denotational semantics which is equivalent to the operational semantics for textually aligned programs.","authors":["Frédéric Dabrowski"],"meta":["July 2019Journal of Logical and Algebraic Methods in Programming 108(9)","DOI:10.1016/j.jlamp.2019.02.010"],"references":["317487665_Replicated_Synchronization_for_Imperative_BSP_Programs","224483213_Some_computer_organizations_and_their_effectiveness_IEEE_Trans_Comput_C-21948","221496788_Concurrency_Analysis_for_Parallel_Programs_with_Textually_Aligned_Barriers","220857740_Bulk_Synchronous_Parallel_ML_Modular_Implementation_and_Performance_Prediction","220284743_A_Static_Analysis_for_Bulk_Synchronous_Parallel_ML_to_Avoid_Parallel_Nesting","215446169_Applicative_Programming_with_Effects","329065174_A_Denotational_Semantics_of_Textually_Aligned_SPMD_Programs","326167026_Textual_alignment_in_SPMD_programs","262604923_MulticoreBSP_for_C_A_High-Performance_Library_for_Shared-Memory_Parallel_Programming","261486288_Can_We_Make_It_Faster_Efficient_May-Happen-in-Parallel_Analysis_Revisited","222506723_BSPlib_the_BSP_programming_library","221643665_Barrier_matching_for_programs_with_textually_unaligned_barriers","220105573_Titanium_A_High-performance_Java_Dialect","2451668_Barrier_Inference"]}
