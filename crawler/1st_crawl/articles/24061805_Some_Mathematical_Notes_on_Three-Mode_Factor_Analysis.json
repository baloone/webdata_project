{"id":"24061805_Some_Mathematical_Notes_on_Three-Mode_Factor_Analysis","abstract":"The model for three-mode factor analysis is discussed in terms of newer applications of mathematical processes including a type of matrix process termed the Kronecker product and the definition of combination variables. Three methods of analysis to a type of extension of principal components analysis are discussed. Methods II and III are applicable to analysis of data collected for a large sample of individuals. An extension of the model is described in which allowance is made for unique variance for each combination variable when the data are collected for a large sample of individuals.","authors":["Ledyard R Tucker"],"meta":["February 1966Psychometrika 31(3):279-311","DOI:10.1007/BF02289464","SourceRePEc"],"references":["316750435_The_Measurement_of_Meaning","285519713_Implications_of_factor_analysis_of_three-way_matrices_for_measurement_of_change","247875728_Extension_of_factor_analysis_to_three-dimensional_matrices","246528267_Introduction_to_Matrix_Analysis_Second_Edition","235726235_Convergent_and_Discriminant_Validation_By_the_Multitrait-Multimethod_Matrix","232546009_Experiments_in_Multimode_Factor_Analysis","200003614_The_Measurement_Of_Meaning","50334697_Introduction_to_Matrix_Analysis","24061019_The_Approximation_of_One_Matrix_by_Another_of_Lower_Rank","17330107_Three-Mode_Factor_Analysis","9932771_Convergent_and_Discriminant_Validation_by_the_Multitrait-Multimethod_Matrix"]}
