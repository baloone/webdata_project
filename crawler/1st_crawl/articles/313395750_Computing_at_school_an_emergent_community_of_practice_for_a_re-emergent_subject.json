Their concern was the drop in applications for undergraduate computing courses and a dearth of specialists entering relatedprofessions. This paper studies the development of the organisation with respect to models of communities of practice. The methodology is a retrospective reflexive study based analysis of e-mail transactions to review the associationâ€™s activities and relationships with other stakeholders in computing education. Through this, the formation of a new professional community of practice is tracked and its characteristics established","authors":["Pete Bradshaw","John Woollard"],"meta":["July 2012","Conference: nternational Conference on ICT in Education"],"references":[]}
