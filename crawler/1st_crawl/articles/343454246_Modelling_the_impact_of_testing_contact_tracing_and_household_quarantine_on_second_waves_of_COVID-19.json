{"id":"343454246_Modelling_the_impact_of_testing_contact_tracing_and_household_quarantine_on_second_waves_of_COVID-19","abstract":"While severe social-distancing measures have proven effective in slowing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, second-wave scenarios are likely to emerge as restrictions are lifted. Here we integrate anonymized, geolocalized mobility data with census and demographic data to build a detailed agent-based model of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission in the Boston metropolitan area. We find that a period of strict social distancing followed by a robust level of testing, contact-tracing and household quarantine could keep the disease within the capacity of the healthcare system while enabling the reopening of economic activities. Our results show that a response system based on enhanced testing and contact tracing can have a major role in relaxing social-distancing interventions in the absence of herd immunity against SARS-CoV-2. An agent-based model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission shows that testing, contact tracing and household quarantine could keep new COVID-19 waves under control while allowing the reopening of the economy with minimal social-distancing interventions.","authors":["Alberto Aleta","David Mart√≠n-Corral","Ana Pastore y Piontti","Marco Ajelli"],"meta":["September 2020Nature Human Behaviour 4(9):1-8","DOI:10.1038/s41562-020-0931-9"],"references":["348422219_Inferring_high-resolution_human_mixing_patterns_for_disease_modeling","343307408_Impact_of_lockdown_on_COVID-19_epidemic_in_Ile-de-France_and_possible_exit_strategies","342225608_Effectiveness_of_isolation_testing_contact_tracing_and_physical_distancing_on_reducing_transmission_of_SARS-CoV-2_in_different_settings_a_mathematical_modelling_study","342144328_The_impact_of_COVID-19_and_strategies_for_mitigation_and_suppression_in_low-_And_middle-income_countries","342008450_Estimating_the_effects_of_non-pharmaceutical_interventions_on_COVID-19_in_Europe","341035837_Effectiveness_of_isolation_testing_contact_tracing_and_physical_distancing_on_reducing_transmission_of_SARS-CoV-2_in_different_settings","341032903_Changes_in_contact_patterns_shape_the_dynamics_of_the_COVID-19_outbreak_in_China","340737801_Expected_impact_of_lockdown_in_Ile-de-France_and_possible_exit_strategies","340640824_Projecting_the_transmission_dynamics_of_SARS-CoV-2_through_the_postpandemic_period","340521939_First-wave_COVID-19_transmissibility_and_severity_in_China_outside_Hubei_after_control_measures_and_second-wave_scenario_planning_a_modelling_impact_assessment","340316786_Quantifying_SARS-CoV-2_transmission_suggests_epidemic_control_with_digital_contact_tracing","340291890_Estimates_of_the_severity_of_coronavirus_disease_2019_a_model-based_analysis","340180593_The_effect_of_human_mobility_and_control_measures_on_the_COVID-19_epidemic_in_China","339590049_Feasibility_of_controlling_COVID-19_outbreaks_by_isolation_of_cases_and_contacts","340392478_Evolving_epidemiology_and_transmission_dynamics_of_coronavirus_disease_2019_outside_Hubei_province_China_a_descriptive_and_modelling_study"]}
