{"id":"317163522_Multitasking_Scheduling_Problems_with_Deterioration_Effect","abstract":"Multitasking scheduling problems with a deterioration effect incurred by coexisting behavioral phenomena in human-related scheduling systems including deteriorating task processing times and deteriorating rate-modifying activity (DRMA) of human operators are addressed. Under the assumption of this problem, the processing of a selected task suffers from the joint effect of available but unfinished waiting tasks, the position-dependent deterioration of task processing time, and the DRMA of human operators. Traditionally, these issues have been considered separately; herein, we address their integration. We propose optimal algorithms to solve the problems to minimize makespan and the total absolute differences in completion time, respectively. Based on the analysis, some special cases and extensions are also discussed.","authors":["Zhanguo Zhu","Jinlin Li","Chengbin Chu"],"meta":["April 2017Mathematical Problems in Engineering 2017(1)","DOI:10.1155/2017/4750791"],"references":["271747650_Single-machine_batch_delivery_scheduling_and_common_due-date_assignment_with_a_rate-modifying_activity","313780679_Multitasking_scheduling_with_multiple_rate-modifying_activities_Z_Zhu_et_al","305364860_Multitasking_scheduling_problems_with_a_rate-modifying_activity","304292741_Analysis_on_the_Effect_of_Multitasking","271011348_The_computational_complexity_analysis_of_the_two-processor_flowshop_problems_with_position_dependent_job_processing_times","270399369_Time_Allocation_and_Task_Juggling","269987548_Scheduling_a_deteriorating_maintenance_activity_and_due-window_assignment","269936432_The_Effects_of_Multitasking_on_Operations_Scheduling","265417433_Single-machine_common_flow_allowance_scheduling_with_aging_effect_resource_allocation_and_a_rate-modifying_activity","262364286_Scheduling_jobs_to_consider_physiological_factors"]}
