{"id":"278619265_Efficient_approximation_of_MIN_SET_COVER_by_low-complexity_exponential_algorithms","abstract":"This paper proposes a way to bring together two seemingly \"foreign\" domains that are the polynomial approximation and the exact computation for NP-hard problems. We show how one can match ideas from both areas in order to design approximation algorithms achiev- ing ratios unachievable in polynomial time (unless a very unlikely complexity conjecture is confirmed) with worst-case complexity much lower (though super-polynomial) than that of an exact computation. We then apply these ideas to two famous combinatorial optimiza- tion problems, namely, the MAX INDEPENDENT SET and the MIN VERTEX COVER, as well as to some other problems mainly linked to max independent set by simple approximation preserving reductions.","authors":["Nicolas Bourgeois","Bruno Escoffier","Vangelis Paschos"],"meta":["December 2007"],"references":["226785142_On_Parameterized_Approximability","225449378_Fixed-Parameter_Approximation_Conceptual_Framework_and_Approximability_Results","221580898_Reducibility_Among_Combinatorial_Problems","220995009_Design_by_Measure_and_Conquer_A_Faster_Exact_Algorithm_for_Dominating_Set","220780437_Confronting_Hardness_Using_a_Hybrid_Approach","220530560_Some_New_Techniques_in_Design_and_Analysis_of_Exact_Exponential_Algorithms","220137887_On_Parameterized_Approximability","284039089_Reducibility_among_combinatorial_problems","242457186_Proof_verification_and_intractability_of_approximation_problems","230595844_Graphs_and_Hypergraphs","228057776_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Combinatorial_Problems","224678311_Inclusion--Exclusion_Algorithms_for_Counting_Set_Partitions","223996142_On_an_approximation_measure_founded_on_the_links_between_optimization_and_polynomial_approximation_theory","223104004_A_modified_greedy_heuristic_for_the_Set_Covering_problem_with_improved_worst_case_bound","222554608_Completeness_in_standard_and_differential_approximation_classes_Poly-DAPX-_and_DPTAS-completeness","222524562_z-Approximations","222480097_Differential_approximation_algorithms_for_some_combinatorial_optimization_problems","222447183_Non-Deterministic_Polynomial_Optimization_Problems_and_Their_Approximation","222265105_On_the_ratio_of_optimal_integer_and_fractional_covers","221591949_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Combinatorial_Problems","221369179_Exact_Algorithms_for_NP-Hard_Problems_A_Survey","220994364_Algorithmics_in_Exponential_Time","220992949_Parameterized_Approximation_Problems","220657872_A_note_on_the_complexity_of_minimum_dominating_set","220616921_Approximation_Algorithms_for_the_Set_Covering_and_Vertex_Cover_Problems","220573617_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Combinatorial_Problems","220112015_Parameterized_approximation_of_dominating_set_problems","201976725_A_Tight_Analysis_of_the_Greedy_Algorithm_for_Set_Cover","41817445_On_the_differential_approximation_of_MIN_SET_COVER_juin_2004","29642899_Effcient_approximation_by_low-complexity_exponential_algorithms","4023801_Vertex_cover_might_be_hard_to_approximate_to_within_2-epsiv","2587060_Approximation_of_k-Set_Cover_by_Semi-Local_Optimization","2323065_A_Threshold_of_Ln_N_for_Approximating_Set_Cover","1955092_Improved_Algorithms_for_3-Coloring_3-Edge-Coloring_and_Constraint_Satisfaction"]}
