{"id":"222645366_Model_checking_propositional_dynamic_logic_with_all_extras","abstract":"This paper presents a model checking algorithm for Propositional Dynamic Logic (PDL) with looping, repeat, test, intersection, converse, program complementation as well as context-free programs. The algorithm shows that the model checking problem for PDL remains PTIME-complete in the presence of all these operators, in contrast to the high increase in complexity that they cause for the satisfiability problem.","authors":["Martin Lange"],"meta":["March 2006Journal of Applied Logic 4(1):39-49","DOI:10.1016/j.jal.2005.08.002","SourceDBLP"],"references":["226966494_Model_Checking_Knowledge_and_Time","221454875_Concurrent_Dynamic_Epistemic_Logic_for_MAS","220520582_Conjunctive_Grammars","220444920_Verifying_Epistemic_Properties_of_Multi-agent_Systems_via_Bounded_Model_Checking","210113153_Model_checking_for_detection_of_sport_highlights","27709184_Dynamic_Logic_for_Reasoning_About_Actions_and_Agents","2558653_An_Overview_of_Conjunctive_Grammars","2379671_A_Dynamic_Logic_for_Acting_Sensing_and_Planning","319394472_Dynamic_Logic","314722667_Concurrent_dynamic_epistemic_logic_for_MAS","313551285_Boosting_the_correspondence_between_description_logics_and_propositional_dynamic_logics","285695187_Handbookof_Theoretical_Computer_Science","279957000_Dynamic_Logic","252368906_Handbook_of_theoretical_computer_science_-_Part_A_Algorithms_and_complexity_Part_B_Formal_models_and_semantics","246844156_Model_checking_for_contextual_reasoning_in_nlg","243512950_Recurring_Dominoes_Making_the_Highly_Undecidable_Highly_Understandable","232633972_Models_of_program_logics","227150482_Gaussian_elimination_is_not_optimal","223693805_Propositional_dynamic_logic_of_looping_and_converse_is_elementarily_decidable","222594662_Automata-Theoretic_Techniques_for_Modal_Logics_of_Programs","222460749_Propositional_Dynamic_Logic_of_Nonregular_Programs","222459264_The_complexity_of_PDL_with_interleaving","221605900_Boosting_the_Correspondence_between_Description_Logics_and_Propositional_Dynamic_Logics","221591865_Propositional_Dynamic_Logic_of_Looping_and_Converse","221394646_Nondeterministic_Propositional_Dynamic_Logic_with_intersection_is_decidable","220827091_The_Taming_of_Converse_Reasoning_about_Two-way_Computations","220705950_A_Lower_Complexity_Bound_for_Propositional_Dynamic_Logic_with_Intersection","220692796_The_Knowledge_Acquisition_and_Representation_Language_KARL","220575001_Propositional_Dynamic_Logic_of_Regular_Programs","220431245_Alternation","220430692_A_New_Normal-Form_Theorem_for_Context-Free_Phrase_Structure_Grammars","220430441_A_Theorem_on_Boolean_Matrices","220151292_A_Characterization_of_Exponential-Time_Languages_by_Alternating_Context-Free_Grammars","38347971_A_Lattice-Theoretical_Fixpoint_Theorem_and_Its_Applications","29506306_Workshop_on_Logics_of_Programs","2267746_ML_A_formal_language_for_KADS_models_of_expertise"]}
