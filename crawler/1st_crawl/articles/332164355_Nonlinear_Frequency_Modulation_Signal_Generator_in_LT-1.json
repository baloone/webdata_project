{"id":"332164355_Nonlinear_Frequency_Modulation_Signal_Generator_in_LT-1","abstract":"Generally, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) system transmits linear frequency modulation (LFM) signal to obtain the high-resolution image and weighted windowing is usually employed to suppress sidelobes. However, it will cause a 1-2-dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) loss. Nonlinear frequency modulation (NLFM) signal, which can construct the signal's power spectral density (PSD) to reduce sidelobes without loss of SNR, is a promising candidate. However, the real-time generation of precise NLFM signal is still a technical challenge. In this letter, a high-precision NLFM signal generator with the ability of predistortion compensation is developed, and this signal generator will be employed in LuTan-1 (LT-1, i.e., TwinSAR-L) mission which is an innovative spaceborne bistatic SAR mission and planned to launch in 2020. In addition, a two-step error compensation method is developed to compensate the system error. Finally, the ground experiment is performed to validate the designed signal generator.","authors":["Guodong Jin","Kaiyu Liu","Yun-Kai Deng","Yu Sha"],"meta":["April 2019IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters PP(99):1-5","DOI:10.1109/LGRS.2019.2905359"],"references":["299608413_Synthetic_Aperture_Radar_Imaging_Using_Nonlinear_Frequency_Modulation_Signal","289686268_First_Demonstration_of_Airborne_SAR_With_Nonlinear_FM_Chirp_Waveforms","261300229_The_synthesis_of_some_NLFM_laws_using_the_stationary_phase_principle","328764174_Dechirping_Compression_Method_for_Nonlinear_Frequency_Modulation_Waveforms","327630350_Sidelobe_level_reduction_in_ACF_of_NLFM_waveform","326926164_Phase_Improvement_Algorithm_for_NLFM_Waveform_Design_to_Reduction_of_Sidelobe_Level_in_Autocorrelation_Function","326168748_Simultaneous_range_ambiguity_mitigation_and_sidelobe_reduction_using_orthogonal_non-linear_frequency_modulated_ONLFM_signals_for_satellite_SAR_Imaging","318691860_Nonlinear_FM_waveform_design_to_reduction_of_sidelobe_level_in_autocorrelation_function","309821564_Demonstration_of_NLFM_Waveforms_With_Experiments_and_Doppler_Shift_Compensation_for_SAR_Application","273166646_Polyphase-coded_FM_PCFM_radar_waveforms_part_II_optimization","269401353_Novel_radar_signal_models_using_nonlinear_frequency_modulation","265720033_Synthetic_Aperture_Radar_Systems_and_Signal_Processing","261388455_FPGA_implementation_of_large-scale_matrix_inversion_using_single_double_and_custom_floating-point_precision","224576378_FIR_filter_design_using_a_new_window_function","224239936_A_suitable_FPGA_implementation_of_floating-point_matrix_inversion_based_on_Gauss-Jordan_elimination","224136735_Iterative_Method_for_Nonlinear_FM_Synthesis_of_Radar_Signals","3449495_A_Neural_Fuzzy_Network_Approach_to_Radar_Pulse_Compression","3357578_Nonlinear_frequency_modulation_chirps_for_active_sonar","3081108_Stationary_Phase_Approximations_of_FM_Spectra","3080839_The_Design_of_FM_Pulse_Compression_Signals"]}
