{"id":"222415055_On_the_computational_power_of_probabilistic_and_quantum_branching_program","abstract":"In this paper we show that one-qubit polynomial time computations are\nas powerful as $\\NC^1$ circuits. More generally,\nwe define syntactic models for quantum and stochastic branching\nprograms of bounded width and prove upper and lower bounds on their\npower. We show that any $\\NC^1$ language can be accepted exactly by a\nwidth-$2$ quantum branching program of polynomial length, in contrast\nto the classical case where width $5$ is necessary unless\n$\\NC^1=\\ACC$. This separates width-$2$ quantum programs from\nwidth-$2$ doubly stochastic programs as we show the latter cannot\ncompute the middle bit of multiplication. Finally, we show that\nbounded-width quantum and stochastic programs can be simulated by\nclassical programs of larger but bounded width, and thus are in\n$\\NC^1$.\n\nFor read-once $\\qbp$s, we give a symmetric Boolean function which is\ncomputable by a read-once $\\qbp$ with $O(\\log n)$ width, but not by a\ndeterministic read-once $\\bp$ with $O(n)$ width, or by a classical\nrandomized read-once $\\bp$ with $O(n)$ width whose transitions on each\nlevel are permanent. Finally, we present a general lower bound on the\nwidth of read-once $\\qbp$s, showing that our $O(\\log n)$ upper bound\nfor this symmetric function is almost tight.","authors":["Farid Ablayev","Aida Gainutdinova","Marek Karpinski","Cristopher Moore"],"meta":["December 2005Information and Computation 203(2):145-162","DOI:10.1016/j.ic.2005.04.003","Sourcedx.doi.org"],"references":["243052897_A_Property_of_Finite_Simple_Non-Abelian_Groups","226130270_On_lower_bounds_for_read-k-times_branching_programs","226109863_Quantum_and_Stochastic_Branching_Programs_of_Bounded_Width","221591956_Computing_with_highly_mixed_states_extended_abstract","221590846_Bounded-Width_Polynomial-Size_Branching_Programs_Recognize_Exactly_Those_Languages_in_NC","220137880_On_the_Power_of_Randomized_Branching_Programs","3706254_Circuits_and_expressions_with_non-associative_gates","2189687_On_Computational_Power_of_Quantum_Branching_Programs","2187456_Quantum_and_Stochastic_Branching_Programs_of_Bounded_Width","2184247_Computing_with_Highly_Mixed_States","284528176_Finite_Markov_Chains","280821144_Polynomial-Time_Algorithms_for_Prime_Factorization_and_Discrete_Logarithms_on_a_Quantum_Computer","238198448_Branching_Programs_and_Binary_Decision_Diagrams-Theory_and_Applications","228057894_Computational_Complexity","226375948_Lower_bounds_on_the_size_of_bounded_depth_circuits_over_a_complete_basis_with_logical_addition","225799968_On_the_power_of_randomized_branching_programs","222707213_Quantum_Branching_Programs_and_Space-Bounded_Nonuniform_Quantum_Complexity","222654037_Circuits_and_Expressions_with_Non-Associative_Gates","222556747_Quantum_Automata_and_Quantum_Grammars","222450604_Bounded-width_polynomial-size_branching_programs_recognize_exactly_those_languages_in_NC1","222279537_A_Lower_Bound_for_Integer_Multiplication_on_Randomized_Ordered_Read-Once_Branching_Programs","221590182_Algebraic_Methods_in_the_Theory_of_Lower_Bounds_for_Boolean_Circuit_Complexity","221427260_Ordered_Quantum_Branching_Programs_Are_More_Powerful_than_Ordered_Probabilistic_Branching_Programs_under_a_Bounded-Width_Restriction","220695947_Branching_Programs_and_Binary_Decision_Diagrams","220695656_A_Course_in_Combinatorics","220431870_Finite_monoids_and_the_fine_structure_of_NC","220248377_Probabilistic_Automata","200524403_Quantum_Computation_and_Quantum_Information","4354915_Lower_bounds_by_probabilistic_arguments","3728293_On_the_power_of_quantum_finite_state_automata","2818380_Polynomial-Time_Algorithms_For_Prime_Factorization_And_Discrete_Logarithms_On_A_Quantum_Computer","2750408_Lower_Bounds_for_the_Size_of_Circuits_of_Bounded_Depth_in_Basis"]}
