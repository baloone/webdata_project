{"id":"350873071_Developing_a_Conversational_Agent_to_Explore_Machine_Learning_Concepts","abstract":"This study aims to introduce a discussion platform and curriculum designed to help people understand how machines learn. Research shows how to train an agent through dialogue and understand how information is represented using visualization. This paper starts by providing a comprehensive definition of AI literacy based on existing research and integrates a wide range of different subject documents into a set of key AI literacy skills to develop a user-centered AI. This functionality and structural considerations are organized into a conceptual framework based on the literature. Contributions to this paper can be used to initiate discussion and guide future research on AI learning within the computer science community.","authors":["Ayse Kok Arslan"],"meta":["April 2021INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTERS & TECHNOLOGY 21:26-34","DOI:10.24297/ijct.v21i.9000"],"references":["341809198_Providing_a_platform_for_'what_works'_platform-based_governance_and_the_reshaping_of_teacher_learning_through_the_OECD's_PISA4U","341133378_Rubbing_against_data_infrastructures_methodological_explorations_on_working_within_the_impossibility_of_exteriority","340527887_The_power_of_relation-making_insights_into_the_production_and_operation_of_digital_school_performance_platforms_in_the_US","339855469_The_Social_Life_of_Methods_as_Epistemic_Objects_Interview_with_Celia_Lury","336531883_Topologies_of_Organization_Space_in_Continuous_Deformation","334492830_Understanding_openness_through_invisible_platform_boundaries_a_topological_study_on_MOOCs_as_multiplexes_of_spaces_and_times","334293212_Producing_and_projecting_data_Aesthetic_practices_of_government_data_portals","333706156_Opening_the_black_box_of_data-based_school_monitoring_Data_infrastructures_flows_and_practices_in_state_education_agencies_In_Big_Data_Society","347215297_Becoming-topologies_of_education_deformations_networks_and_the_database_effect","330706404_Algorithmic_Personalization_as_a_Mode_of_Individuation","329367366_Open_Education_platforms_Theoretical_ideas_digital_operations_and_the_figure_of_the_open_learner","327307183_Store_Interface_Package_Connection_Methods_and_Propositions_for_Multi-Situated_App_Studies","325129206_More_than_tools_Making_sense_of_the_ongoing_digitizations_of_higher_education","319106012_Learning_in_the_'platform_society'_Disassembling_an_educational_data_assemblage","328589505_Data_warehousing_organization_Infrastructural_experimentation_with_educational_governance"]}
