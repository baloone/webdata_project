{"id":"264559030_Maximum_ATSP_with_Weights_Zero_and_One_via_Half-Edges","abstract":"We present a fast combinatorial $3/4$-approximation algorithm for the maximum\nasymmetric TSP with weights zero and one. The approximation factor of this\nalgorithm matches the currently best one given by Bl\\\"aser in 2004 and based on\nlinear programming. Our algorithm first computes a maximum size matching and a\nmaximum weight cycle cover without certain cycles of length two but possibly\nwith {\\em half-edges} - a half-edge of a given edge $e$ is informally speaking\na half of $e$ that contains one of the endpoints of $e$. Then from the computed\nmatching and cycle cover it extracts a set of paths, whose weight is large\nenough to be able to construct a traveling salesman tour with the claimed\nguarantee.","authors":["Katarzyna Paluch"],"meta":["February 2018Theory of Computing Systems 62(1)","DOI:10.1007/s00224-017-9818-1","SourcearXiv"],"references":["259742989_Better_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Maximum_Asymmetric_Traveling_Salesman_and_Shortest_Superstring","221499631_An_Osqrtv_E_Algorithm_for_Finding_Maximum_Matching_in_General_Graphs","314596157_Maximum_ATSP_with_Weights_Zero_and_One_via_Half-Edges","265401252_Improved_Inapproximability_Results_for_the_Shortest_Superstring_and_Related_Problems","242929791_The_Traveling_Salesman_Problem_with_Distances_One_and_Two","239066452_An_Analysis_of_Approximations_for_Finding_a_Maximum_Weight_Hamiltonian_Circuit","230596039_Matching_theory","221498588_Long_Tours_and_Short_Superstrings_Preliminary_Version","221462624_Two_Approximation_Algorithms_for_3-Cycle_Covers","221462589_A_34-Approximation_Algorithm_for_Maximum_ATSP_with_Weights_Zero_and_One","220994326_Simpler_Approximation_of_the_Maximum_Asymmetric_Traveling_Salesman_Problem","220532704_A_58_Approximation_Algorithm_for_the_Maximum_Asymmetric_TSP","220778901_An_813-approximation_algorithm_for_the_asymmetric_maximum_TSP","220770624_Computing_Cycle_Covers_without_Short_Cycles","220406467_An_813-approximation_algorithm_for_the_asymmetric_maximum_TSP"]}
