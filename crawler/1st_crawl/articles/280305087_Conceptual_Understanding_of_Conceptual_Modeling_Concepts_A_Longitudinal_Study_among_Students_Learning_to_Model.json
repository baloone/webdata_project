{"id":"280305087_Conceptual_Understanding_of_Conceptual_Modeling_Concepts_A_Longitudinal_Study_among_Students_Learning_to_Model","abstract":"We discuss our investigation into the conceptual understanding that students have of common concepts used for conceptual modeling (e.g., actors, processes, goals). We studied if and how those understandings may change over time during a studentâ€™s progress through their academic curriculum. To do so, we performed a longitudinal study with a group of students starting computing and information science studies at Radboud University Nijmegen. We followed them from the beginning of their studies as they learned new theories, techniques, and languages for modeling. We focused on investigating whether their conceptual understandings changed as they became acquainted with new languages and techniques, and whether there were correlations between the introduction of such educational stimuli and changes in their conceptual understanding. We discuss the seeming lack of connection between these stimuli and such changes, and reflect on what this means for the training of people in conceptual modeling.","authors":["D J T Linden","Henderik Alex Proper","Stijn Hoppenbrouwers"],"meta":["June 2014","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-07869-4_19","Conference: Proceedings of the 2nd International Workshop on Cognitive Aspects of Information Systems Engineering (COGNISE)"],"references":["262158958_Beyond_terminologies_Using_psychometrics_to_validate_shared_ontologies","220921210_Towards_an_Investigation_of_the_Conceptual_Landscape_of_Enterprise_Architecture","27472066_Does_It_Matter_Which_Process_Modelling_Language_We_Teach_or_Use_An_Experimental_Study_on_Understanding_Process_Modelling_Languages_without_Formal_Education","4793619_A_Framework_for_Developing_Semantic_Differentials_in_IS_research_Assessing_the_Meaning_of_Electronic_Marketplace_Quality_EMQ"]}
