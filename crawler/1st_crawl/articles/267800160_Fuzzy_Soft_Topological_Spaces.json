{"id":"267800160_Fuzzy_Soft_Topological_Spaces","abstract":"In this paper, we have studied some properties related to fuzzy soft topological spaces and some propositions have been established. Our work is an attempt to introduce the concepts on fuzzy soft point, fuzzy soft neighborhood, fuzzy soft closure, fuzzy soft interior, fuzzy soft subspace topology and thereby extend the work on fuzzy soft topological spaces. Keywordsâ€” Fuzzy soft set, Fuzzy soft topological space, Fuzzy soft point, Fuzzy soft neighborhood, Fuzzy soft closure, Fuzzy soft interior, Fuzzy soft subspace topology.","authors":["Jyoti Tridiv","Neog","Dusmanta Kumar Sut","Gopal Hazarika"],"meta":["January 2012"],"references":["266585352_Theory_of_Fuzzy_Soft_Sets_from_a_New_Perspective","222782394_Soft_set_theory-First_results","26842379_On_Fuzzy_Soft_Sets","283600300_A_note_on_fuzzy_soft_topological_spaces","215586493_Topological_structure_of_fuzzy_soft_sets"]}
