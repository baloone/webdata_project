{"id":"337079604_Augmented_reality_for_interactive_promotion_media_at_Faculty_of_Computer_Science_and_Information_Technology_Mulawarman_University","abstract":"Showing the design and layout of the building using a model, making this model requires time and accuracy because the model is built on a scale that has been adjusted to the building to be made later, a problem that often occurs in modeling is the suitability of the scale and detail of the model. Augmented Reality as a variation of the virtual environment. Users of AR technology can see the real world, with virtual objects added to the real world. So, users see virtual objects and real objects in the same place. Submission of information by utilizing the three-dimensional visualization technique is very interesting because it can display the 3D model of an object before it is built in real terms. The Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology Mulawarman University Samarinda has an exterior building design of a new building, but there are no interactive media that can display the exterior of the building as a whole and in detail. This application is able to be used to apply the 3D model of the building as a whole and can be seen from various viewpoints.","authors":["Muhammad Firdaus","Joan Angelina Widians","J Y Padant"],"meta":["October 2019Journal of Physics Conference Series 1341(4):042017","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/1341/4/042017"],"references":["322705473_Augmented_Reality_AR_Technology_on_The_Android_Operating_System_in_Chemistry_Learning","318382817_Enabling_Tracks_in_Location-Based_Smart_Mobile_Augmented_Reality_Applications","315593939_Applying_mobile_phone_data_to_travel_behaviour_research_A_literature_review","305109788_ARTAR-Artistic_Augmented_Reality","322488791_Augmented_reality_in_retail_A_trade-off_between_user's_control_of_access_to_personal_information_and_augmentation_quality","321274028_Co-designing_with_children_a_collaborative_augmented_reality_book_based_on_a_primary_school_textbook","320895508_An_interactive_augmented_reality_tool_for_constructing_free-form_modular_surfaces","319439580_Augmented_reality_mobile_app_development_for_all","319148726_Augmented_Reality_Display_Based_on_User_Behavior","318583669_An_Adoption_Framework_for_Mobile_Augmented_Reality_Games_The_Case_of_Pokemon_Go"]}
