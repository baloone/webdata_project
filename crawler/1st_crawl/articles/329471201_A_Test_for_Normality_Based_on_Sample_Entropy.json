{"id":"329471201_A_Test_for_Normality_Based_on_Sample_Entropy","abstract":"A test of the composite hypothesis of normality is introduced. The test is based on the property of the normal distribution that its entropy exceeds that of any other distribution with a density that has the same variance. The test statistic is based on a class of estimators of entropy constructed here. The test is shown to be a consistent test of the null hypothesis for all alternatives without a singular continuous part. The power of the test is estimated against several alternatives. It is observed that the test compares favourably with other tests for normality.","authors":["Oldrich Vasicek"],"meta":["September 1976Journal of the Royal Statistical Society.
