{"id":"260674968_Unified_methodology_for_evaluating_vessel_tree_tortuosity_metrics_in_eye_fundus_images","abstract":"The tortuosity of a vessel, that is, how and how many times the vessel bends, is a relevant measure to diagnose different pathologies. However, there is an important drawback regarding its definition, as each specialist has its own estimation about what a tortuous vessel is. Moreover, other drawback remains in the fact that the process has to be evaluated manually and rudimentary, implying a large and tedious work.\n\nThat is why there are numerous studies that have attempted to define a reliable and deterministic measure for this parameter, but employing different approaches, inputs and validation criteria. In this article, we intended to implement a unified methodology that integrates the different metrics and also to establish a comparison among the existing tortuosity metrics, employing the same inputs and validation criteria, as well as defining an homogeneous procedure for the extraction of the vascular tree.","authors":["Luisa Sánchez Brea","Jorge Novo","Alba Fernández Arias","J.M.
