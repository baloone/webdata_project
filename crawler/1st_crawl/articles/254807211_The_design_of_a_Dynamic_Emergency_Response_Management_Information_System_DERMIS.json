{"id":"254807211_The_design_of_a_Dynamic_Emergency_Response_Management_Information_System_DERMIS","abstract":"This is a paper on the design of an operative collaborative system that was developed to manage the 1971 wage price freeze which allowed 300 mangers around the country to operate as a single group for the Office of Emergency Preparedness. It as the first group software system that gave many special collaborative features including\nmail, group conferencing in a single conference, group notebooks to collect and comment on items like new events, being able to define numeric variables that could be single values, vectors, or tables of data where different participants could be responsible for filling in a single value and update it when it changed, also any members of the notebook could comment on any values to hold a discussion of that value or values. It had many other features that had never been available for large groups working on a single task like maintaining and modifying the wage price freeze. The book the Network Nation by Hiltz and Turoff 1978 has a large chapter on the experiences that took place with this system and how users reacted to it.","authors":["Murray Turoff","Michael J Chumer","Bartel Van de Walle","X.
