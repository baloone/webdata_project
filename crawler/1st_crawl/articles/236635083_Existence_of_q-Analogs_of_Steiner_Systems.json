{"id":"236635083_Existence_of_q-Analogs_of_Steiner_Systems","abstract":"Let $\\F_q^n$ be a vector space of dimension $n$ over the finite field $\\F_q$.\nA $q$-analog of a Steiner system (briefly, a $q$-Steiner system), denoted\n$S_q[t,k,n]$, is a set $S$ of $k$-dimensional subspaces of $\\F_q^n$ such that\neach $t$-dimensional subspace of $\\F_q^n$ is contained in exactly one element\nof $S$. Presently, $q$-Steiner systems are known only for $t=1$, and in the\ntrivial cases $t = k$ and $k = n$. Invthis paper, the first nontrivial\n$q$-Steiner systems with $t >= 2$ are constructed. Specifically, several\nnonisomorphic $q$-Steiner systems $S_2[2,3,13]$ are found by requiring that\ntheir automorphism groups contain the normalizer of a Singer subgroup of\n$\\GL(13,2)$. This approach leads to an instance of the exact cover problem,\nwhich turns out to have many solutions.","authors":["Michael Braun","Tuvi Etzion","Patric Ostergard","Alexander Vardy"],"meta":["April 2013Forum of Mathematics Pi 4","DOI:10.1017/fmp.2016.5","SourcearXiv"],"references":["345229614_Generalisation_of_Fisher's_inequality_to_fields_with_more_than_one_element","329786658_Difference_families","269007994_Generalisation_of_Fisher's_inequality_to_fields_with_more_than_one_element","268535803_Classification_Algorithms_for_Codes_and_Designs","267476031_Some_balanced_incomplete_block_design_constructions","267118409_On_q-analogs_of_Steiner_systems_and_covering_designs","266827285_Remarks_on_Singer_Cyclic_Groups_and_Their_Normalizers","266224627_Bose-Burton_type_theorems_for_finite_projective_affine_and_polar_spaces","265584879_BIBDs_with_small_block_size","265451880_Endliche_Gruppen_I"]}
