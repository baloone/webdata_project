{"id":"277906943_BREAST_CANCER_DIAGNOSIS_AND_RECURRENCE_PREDICTION_USING_MACHINE_LEARNING_TECHNIQUES","abstract":"Breast Cancer has become the common cause of death among women. Due to long hours invested in manual diagnosis and lesser diagnostic system available emphasize the development of automated diagnosis for early diagnosis of the disease. Our aim is to classify whether the breast cancer is benign or malignant and predict the recurrence and non-recurrence of malignant cases after a certain period. To achieve this we have used machine learning techniques such as Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, KNN and Naive Bayes. These techniques are coded in MATLAB using UCI machine learning depository. We have compared the accuracies of different techniques and observed the results. We found SVM most suited for predictive analysis and KNN performed best for our overall methodology.","authors":["Mandeep Rana"],"meta":["April 2015International Journal of Research in Engineering and Technology 04(04):372-376","DOI:10.15623/ijret.2015.0404066"],"references":[]}
