{"id":"273067092_Polynomial_Kernelization_for_Removing_Induced_Claws_and_Diamonds","abstract":"A graph is called (claw,diamond)-free if it contains neither a claw (a\n$K_{1,3}$) nor a diamond (a $K_4$ with an edge removed) as an induced subgraph.\nEquivalently, (claw,diamond)-free graphs can be characterized as line graphs of\ntriangle-free graphs, or as linear dominoes, i.e., graphs in which every vertex\nis in at most two maximal cliques and every edge is in exactly one maximal\nclique.\nIn this paper we consider the parameterized complexity of the\n(claw,diamond)-free Edge Deletion problem, where given a graph $G$ and a\nparameter $k$, the question is whether one can remove at most $k$ edges from\n$G$ to obtain a (claw,diamond)-free graph. Our main result is that this problem\nadmits a polynomial kernel. We complement this finding by proving that, even on\ninstances with maximum degree $6$, the problem is NP-complete and cannot be\nsolved in time $2^{o(k)}\\cdot |V(G)|^{O(1)}$ unless the Exponential Time\nHypothesis fail","authors":["Marek Cygan","Marcin Pilipczuk","Micha≈Ç Pilipczuk","Erik Jan van Leeuwen"],"meta":["May 2017Theory of Computing Systems 60(4)","DOI:10.1007/s00224-016-9689-x","SourcearXiv"],"references":["354042198_Polynomial_kernels_for_paw-free_edge_modification_problems","346784544_Parameterized_Complexity_of_Induced_Graph_Matching_on_Claw-Free_Graphs","321620239_Parameterized_Complexity_Theory","316800486_Monographs_in_Computer_Science","313903170_Parameterized_Algorithms","283818184_A_Subexponential_Parameterized_Algorithm_for_Proper_Interval_Completion","282451003_Exploring_the_Subexponential_Complexity_of_Completion_Problems","276350200_Incompressibility_of_H_H_-Free_Edge_Modification_Problems","269997510_A_Polynomial_Kernel_for_Trivially_Perfect_Editing","268026188_Incompressibility_of_H-Free_Edge_Modification"]}
