{"id":"315508967_Information_theory_for_information_science_Antecedents_philosophy_and_applications","abstract":"This paper provides an historical overview of the theoretical antecedents leading to information theory, specifically those useful for understanding and teaching information science and systems. Information may be discussed in a philosophical manner and at the same time be measureable. This notion of information can thus be the subject of philosophical discussion and the ideas about information may be applied rigorously to a wide range of practical applications where processes are studied. Theoretical Information Science and specific Information Science applications may provide tools by which questions such as ''when and what information can be produced''? can be answered, as well as how to implement a system to serve a particular commercial or other specific function. These topics are discussed, and philosophical literature that might serve as a prerequisite to learning Information Science is suggested.","authors":["Robert M.
