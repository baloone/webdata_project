{"id":"221591876_Pseudorandom_generators_for_low_degree_polynomials","abstract":"We investigate constructions of pseudorandom generators that fool polynomial tests of degree d in m variables over finite fields F. Our main construction gives a generator with seed length O(d4 log m (1 + log(d ⁄ ε) ⁄ log log m) + log |F|) bits that achieves arbitrarily small bias ε and works whenever |F| is at least polynomial in d, log m, and 1⁄ε. We also present an alternate construction that uses a seed that can be described by O(c2d8m6⁄(c-2) log(d⁄ε) + log |F|) bits (more precisely, O(c2d8m6⁄(c-2)) field elements, each chosen from a set of size poly(cd⁄ε), plus two field elements ranging over all of F), works whenever |F| is at least polynomial in c, d, and 1⁄ε, and has the property that every element of the output is a function of at most c field elements in the input. Both generators are computable by small arithmetic circuits. The main tool used in the construction is a reduction that allows us to transform any \"dense\" hitting set generator for polynomials into a pseudorandom generator.","authors":["Andrej Bogdanov"],"meta":["January 2005Proceedings of the Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing","DOI:10.1145/1060590.1060594","SourceDBLP","Conference: Proceedings of the 37th Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, Baltimore, MD, USA, May 22-24, 2005"],"references":["38413447_Randomness-Efficient_Low-Degree_Tests_and_Short_PCPs_Via_Epsilon-Biased_Sets","285942964_Cryptography_in_NC_0_extended_abstract","268542326_Zur_Methode_von_Stepanov","268497585_Sur_les_courbes_algebriques_et_les_varietes_s'en_deduisent","262310864_Pseudorandom_Bits_for_Constant_Depth_Circuits_with_Few_Arbitrary_Symmetric_Gates","235008639_Hardness_vs_randomness","234812500_Fast_Probabilistic_Algorithms_for_Verification_of_Polynomial_Identities","232633216_Simple_construction_of_almost_k-wise_independent_random_variables","232335004_A_lower_bound_for_the_number_of_solutions_of_equations_over_finite_fields","225555150_Solvability_of_systems_of_polynomial_congruences_modulo_a_large_prime","221590303_Using_Nondeterminism_to_Amplify_Hardness","221499823_On_e-Biased_Generators_in_NC0","221499126_Cryptography_in_NC","220432360_A_New_General_Derandomization_Method","220138604_On_obtaining_pseudorandomness_from_error-correcting_codes","27287267_The_theory_of_error_correcting_codes"]}
