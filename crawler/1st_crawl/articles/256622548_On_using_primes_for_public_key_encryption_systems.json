{"id":"256622548_On_using_primes_for_public_key_encryption_systems","abstract":"It is shown that the popular RSA public key encryption scheme does not require two primes but that probable primes may be used instead. A method for finding probable primes is given and the security of systems based on probable primes is discussed.","authors":["E.Dennis Huthnance","Joe Warndof"],"meta":["December 1988Applied Mathematics Letters 1(3):225â€“227","DOI:10.1016/0893-9659(88)90081-X"],"references":["314933578_Primality_Testing_and_Factoring","220426448_A_Method_for_Obtaining_Digital_Signatures_and_Public-Key_Cryptosystems","220426289_A_Method_for_Obtaining_Digital_Signatures_and_Public-Key_Cryptosystems"]}
