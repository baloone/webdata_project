Omniplus multi-rotor designs are defined as the ones\nthat allow to exert a total wrench in any direction using positiveonly\nlift force and drag moment (i.e., positive rotational speed)\nfor each rotor blade. Algebraic conditions for a design to be\nomniplus are derived, a simple necessary condition being the\nfact that at least seven propellers have to be used. An energy\noptimal design strategy is then defined as the one minimizing\nthe maximum norm of the input set needed to span a certain\nwrench ellipsoid for the adopted input allocation strategy. Two\ncorresponding major design criteria are then introduced: firstly,\na minimum allocation-matrix condition number aims at an\nequal sharing of the effort needed to generate wrenches in any\ndirection; secondly, imposing a balanced design guarantees an\nequal sharing of the extra effort needed to keep the input in\nthe non-negative orthant. We propose a numerical algorithm to\nsolve such optimal design problem and a control algorithm to\ncontrol any omnidirectional platform. The work is concluded\nwith informative simulation results in non-ideal conditions.","authors":["Marco Tognon","Antonio Franchi"],"meta":["February 2018IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/LRA.2018.2802544"],"references":["316786071_Dynamic_Decentralized_Control_for_Protocentric_Aerial_Manipulators","311755244_Modeling_and_control_of_FAST-Hex_A_fully-actuated_by_synchronized-tilting_hexarotor","280310678_Modeling_Control_and_Design_Optimization_for_a_Fully-actuated_Hexarotor_Aerial_Vehicle_with_Tilted_Propellers","272819834_Mechanical_Design_Modelling_and_Control_of_a_Novel_Aerial_Manipulator","261353253_Hybrid_forcemotion_control_and_internal_dynamics_of_quadrotors_for_tool_operation","311755084_Design_modeling_and_control_of_omni-directional_aerial_robot","303886125_Design_modeling_and_control_of_an_omni-directional_aerial_vehicle","303885466_Experiments_on_coordinated_motion_of_aerial_robotic_manipulators","301836803_Dynamics_Control_and_Estimation_for_Aerial_Robots_Tethered_by_Cables_or_Bars","273397540_A_Novel_Overactuated_Quadrotor_Unmanned_Aerial_Vehicle_Modeling_Control_and_Experimental_Validation"]}
