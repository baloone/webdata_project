{"id":"324055722_Learning_the_Multiple_Traveling_Salesmen_Problem_with_Permutation_Invariant_Pooling_Networks","abstract":"While there are optimal TSP solvers as well as recent learning-based approaches, the generalization of the TSP to the multiple Traveling Salesmen Problem is much less studied. Here, we design a neural network solution that treats the salesmen, the cities, and the depot as three different sets of varying cardinalities. Coupled with a normalization algorithm, a dedicated loss, and a search method, our solution is shown in two benchmarks to outperform all the meta-heuristics of the leading solver in the field.","authors":["Yoav Kaempfer","Lior Wolf"],"meta":["March 2018"],"references":["283732067_Tackling_the_Bi-criteria_Facet_of_Multiple_Traveling_Salesman_Problem_with_Ant_Colony_Systems","19135224_Neural_Computation_of_Decisions_in_Optimization_Problems","3595880_Solving_vehicle_routing_problems_using_elastic_net","317558625_Attention_Is_All_You_Need","315807166_Learning_Combinatorial_Optimization_Algorithms_over_Graphs","301840180_Discriminative_Embeddings_of_Latent_Variable_Models_for_Structured_Data","287661759_An_effective_heuristic_algorithm_for_the_traveling_salesman_problem","284476538_Order_Matters_Sequence_to_sequence_for_sets","278048614_Pointer_Networks","269935079_Adam_A_Method_for_Stochastic_Optimization","235067784_Worst-Case_Analysis_of_a_New_Heuristic_for_the_Traveling_Salesman_Problem","229480240_A_self-organizing_neural_network_approach_for_multiple_traveling_salesman_and_vehicle_routing_problems","226309719_A_neural_network_algorithm_for_the_multiple_traveling_salesmen_problem","223702608_A_competitive_neural_network_algorithm_for_solving_vehicle_routing_problem","222720147_The_Euclidean_Traveling_Salesman_Problem_is_NP-Complete","221617774_Softassign_versus_Softmax_Benchmarks_in_Combinatorial_Optimization","220668826_TSPLIB_A_traveling_salesman_problem_library","220472955_Competition-based_neural_network_for_the_multiple_traveling_salesmen_problem_with_minmax_objective","38346604_Concerning_nonnegative_matrices_and_doubly_stochastic_matrices","23794619_The_multiple_traveling_salesman_problem_An_overview_of_formulations_and_solution_procedures"]}
