Such application, which is extensively studied in the nuclear field, involves many interactions between two phenomena, the mass transfer and the propagation of pressure waves. A simple but physically-based modelling of the mass transfer for the depressurization of water is proposed, which relies on the work of Bilicki & Kestin [1] in the homogeneous frame. Four different experiments have been chosen to assess the proposed model. Three of them study the depressurization of hot water in a pressurized pipe. The comparison between converged numerical results and the experimental data shows a good agreement and demonstrates the ability of the two-fluid-model to capture the proper mass transfer for a wide range of thermodynamical conditions. The last test-case is the HDR experiment which considers the depressurization of a full-scale vessel under the hypothesis of a Loss Of Coolant Accident. The results of an ALE computation show the ability of the proposed model to retrieve experimental data in both structure and fluid.","authors":["Hippolyte Lochon","Frédéric Daude","Pascal Galon","Jean-Marc Hérard"],"meta":["October 2017Computers & Fluids 156:162-174","DOI:10.1016/j.compfluid.2017.07.008","Projects: Multiphase flow models and associated numerical schemesDevelopment in the fast transient dynamics code Europlexus."],"references":["308034062_HLLC-type_Riemann_solver_with_approximated_two-phase_contact_for_the_computation_of_the_Baer-Nunziato_two-fluid_model","289433747_Comparison_of_two-fluid_models_on_steam-water_transients","282599936_Closure_Conditions_for_Non-Equilibrium_Multi-Component_Models","278670449_Dynamic_relaxation_processes_in_compressible_multiphase_flows_Application_to_evaporation_phenomena","267896669_Validation_of_a_two-fluid_model_on_unsteady_liquid-vapor_water_flows","265470429_Modelling_the_non-equilibrium_two-phase_flow_during_depressurisation_of_CO2_pipelines","293489037_Evaluation_of_the_relaxation_time_of_heat_and_mass_exchange_in_the_liquid-vapour_bubble_flow","283285631_On_the_computation_of_the_Baer-Nunziato_model_using_ALE_formulation_with_HLL-_and_HLLC-type_solvers_towards_fluid-structure_interactions","263418360_The_non-equilibrium_relaxation_model_for_one-dimensional_flashing_liquid_flow","260599993_Numerical_experiments_using_a_HLLC-type_scheme_with_ALE_formulation_for_compressible_two-phase_flows_five-equation_models_with_phase_transition"]}
