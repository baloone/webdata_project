{"id":"343376652_Machine_Learning_and_Optimization_for_Production_Rescheduling_in_Industry_40","abstract":"Along with the fourth industrial revolution,\ndifferent tools coming from Optimization, Internet of\nThings, Data Science, and Artificial Intelligence fields are\ncreating new opportunities in production management.\nWhile manufacturing processes are stochastic and\nrescheduling decisions need to be made under uncertainty,\nit is still a complicated task to decide whether a\nrescheduling is worthwhile, which is often addressed in\npractice on a greedy basis. To find a tradeoff between\nrescheduling frequency and the growing accumulation of\ndelays, we propose a rescheduling framework, which\nintegrates Machine Learning (ML) techniques and\noptimization algorithms. To prove the effectiveness, we first\nmodel a flexible job shop scheduling problem with\nsequence-dependent setup and limited dual resources\n(FJSP) inspired by an industrial application. Then we solve\nthe scheduling problem through a hybrid metaheuristic\napproach. We train the ML classification model for\nidentifying rescheduling patterns. Finally, we compare its\nrescheduling performance with periodical rescheduling\napproaches. Through observing the simulation results, we\nfind the integration of these techniques can provide a good\ncompromise between rescheduling frequency and\nscheduling delays. The main contributions of the work are\nthe formalization of the FJSP problem, the development of\nad-hoc solution methods, and the proposal/validation of an innovative ML and optimization-based framework for\nsupporting rescheduling decision.","authors":["Daniele Manerba","Yuanyuan Li","Stefano Carabelli","Roberto Tadei"],"meta":["October 2020The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology","DOI:10.1007/s00170-020-05850-5","Project: Plastic & Rubber 4.0"],"references":["340112172_Smartphone_Data_Classification_Technique_for_Detecting_the_Usage_of_Public_or_Private_Transportation_Modes","337357259_Design_and_management_of_digital_manufacturing_and_assembly_systems_in_the_Industry_40_era","336998857_Infinitely_repeated_game_based_real-time_scheduling_for_low-carbon_flexible_job_shop_considering_multi-time_periods","336590520_A_mixed_integer_linear_programming_modelling_for_the_flexible_cyclic_jobshop_problem","335567201_Evaluation_of_in-mold_sensors_and_machine_data_towards_enhancing_product_quality_and_process_monitoring_via_Industry_40","334612164_Synchromodal_Logistics_An_overview_of_critical_success_factors_enabling_technologies_and_open_research_issues","332944884_A_game-theory_approach_based_on_genetic_algorithm_for_flexible_job_shop_scheduling_problem","340512556_Intelligent_decision-making_model_based_on_minority_game_for_resource_allocation_in_cloud_manufacturing","338717135_Smart_Manufacturing_Systems_A_Game_Theory_based_Approach","333394713_A_hybrid_genetic_algorithm_for_multi-objective_flexible_job_shop_scheduling_problem_considering_transportation_time"]}
