{"id":"291291612_Artificial_intelligence_applications_in_power_systems","abstract":"1999 International Conference on Intelligent System Applications to Power Systems (ISAP'99) was held in Brazil from April 4 to 8, 1999. Totally 72 papers were published in the conference proceedings which represent the latest development in this broad research field in the last two years. In this paper, a literature survey of ISAP'99 is given first, followed by a brief overview on applications of three relatively new artificial intelligence methods, i. e., the distributed artificial intelligence, rough set theory and data mining, in power systems. This project is jointly supported by Zhejiang provincial foundation for outstanding young scientists and Cao Guangbiao foundation for high technology development.","authors":["H.
