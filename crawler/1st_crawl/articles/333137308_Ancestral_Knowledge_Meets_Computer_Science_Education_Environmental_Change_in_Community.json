{"id":"333137308_Ancestral_Knowledge_Meets_Computer_Science_Education_Environmental_Change_in_Community","abstract":"This book illustrates a pathway for knowledge production to benefit from interweaving the seemingly disparate historical experiences of Indigenous Peoples and computer science education. The resulting practice of ancestral computing for sustainability holds the power to mitigate the destructive forces of the field, while extending the potential of traditionally underserved and unheard populations. Reimagining the field of computer science, interwoven with traditional lifeways, presents compelling new discoveries in research and harnesses the rich tapestries that are Indigenous populations. Returning healthy lifeways to a center stage long-occupied by tightly controlled, Eurocentric learning methods opens worlds of opportunity that have felt lost to time.","authors":["Cueponcaxochitl Dianna Moreno Sandoval"],"meta":["January 2019","DOI:10.1057/978-1-137-47520-6","ISBN: 978-1-137-47519-0"],"references":[]}
