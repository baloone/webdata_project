{"id":"273189192_Les_valeurs_de_base_de_la_personne_theorie_mesures_et_applications","abstract":"Basic human values : theory, measurement, and applications.\nApplying the values construct in the social sciences has suffered from the absence of an agreed-upon conception of basic values, of the content and structure of relations among these values, and of reliable methods to measure them. This article presents data from over 70 countries, using two different instruments, to validate a theory intended to fill part of this gap. It concerns the basic values that individuals in all cultures recognize. The theory identifies 10 motivationally distinct values and specifies the dynamics of conflict and congruence among them. These dynamics yield a structure of relations among values common to culturally diverse groups, suggesting an universal organization of human motivations. Individuals and groups differ in the priorities they assign to these values. The article examines sources of individual differences in value priorities and behavioral and attitudinal consequences that follow from holding particular value priorities. In doing so, it considers processes through which values are influenced and through which they influence action.","authors":["Shalom H Schwartz"],"meta":["January 2006Revue Fran√ßaise de Sociologie 47(4):929","DOI:10.3917/rfs.474.0929"],"references":["247723936_Extending_the_Cross-Cultural_Validity_of_the_Theory_of_Basic_Human_Values_with_a_Different_Method_of_Measurement","227690728_Personality_and_Politics_Values_Traits_and_Political_Choice","227661184_Influences_of_Adaptation_to_Communist_Rule_on_Value_Priorities_in_Eastern_Europe","222293101_Evaluating_the_structure_of_human_values_with_confirmatory_factor_analysis","12496703_Worries_and_Values","11460661_Motivated_decision_making_Effects_of_activation_and_self-centrality_of_values_on_choices_and_behavior","317953663_Self-Efficacy_Toward_a_Unifying_Theory_of_Behavioral_Change","249173822_Trends_in_Parental_Socialization_Values_Detroit_1958-1983","240284149_A_Rose_by_Any_Other_Name_The_Values_Construct","232424514_Conflict_arousal_and_curiosity_McGraw-Hill_series_in_psychology"]}
