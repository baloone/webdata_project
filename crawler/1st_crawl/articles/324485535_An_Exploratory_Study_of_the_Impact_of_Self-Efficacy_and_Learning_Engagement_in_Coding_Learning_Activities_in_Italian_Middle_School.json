{"id":"324485535_An_Exploratory_Study_of_the_Impact_of_Self-Efficacy_and_Learning_Engagement_in_Coding_Learning_Activities_in_Italian_Middle_School","abstract":"In Italy, teaching coding at primary and secondary levels is emerging as a major educational issue, particularly in light of the recent reforms now being implemented. Consequently, there has been increased research on how to introduce information technology in lower secondary schools. This paper presents an exploratory survey, carried out through an intensive workshop on coding, which was designed to introduce the basic principles of computer science to be included in the future school curriculum. Specifically, the paper examines three key aspects of the coding unit for lower secondary schools: (a) the students’ perception of their self-efficacy in carrying out coding; (b) the involvement of students’ cognition and perception; (c) the principal obstacles students might encounter while coding. The results are encouraging as they demonstrate that coding turns out to be both highly interesting and motivating for students. © 2017, Association for the Advancement of Computing in Education.
