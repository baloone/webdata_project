{"id":"330296199_Mining_Top-k_Useful_Negative_Sequential_Patterns_via_Learning","abstract":"As an important tool for behavior informatics, negative sequential patterns (NSPs) (such as missing a medical treatment) are sometimes much more informative than positive sequential patterns (PSPs) (e.g., attending a medical treatment) in many applications. However, NSP mining is at an early stage and faces many challenging problems, including 1) how to mine an expected number of NSPs; 2) how to select useful NSPs; and 3) how to reduce high time consumption. To solve the first problem, we propose an algorithm Topk-NSP to mine the k most frequent negative patterns. In Topk-NSP, we first mine the top- k PSPs using the existing methods, and then we use an idea which is similar to top- k PSPs mining to mine the top- k NSPs from these PSPs. To solve the remaining two problems, we propose three optimization strategies for Topk-NSP. The first optimization strategy is that, in order to consider the influence of PSPs when selecting useful top- k NSPs, we introduce two weights, wP and wN , to express the user preference degree for NSPs and PSPs, respectively, and select useful NSPs by a weighted support wsup. The second optimization strategy is to merge wsup and an interestingness metric to select more useful NSPs. The third optimization strategy is to introduce a pruning strategy to reduce the high computational costs of Topk-NSP. Finally, we propose an optimization algorithm Topk-NSP+. To the best of our knowledge, Topk-NSP+ is the first algorithm that can mine the top- k useful NSPs. The experimental results on four synthetic and two real-life data sets show that the Topk-NSP+ is very efficient in mining the top- k NSPs in the sense of computational cost and scalability.","authors":["Xiangjun Dong","Ping Qiu","Jinhu Lu","Longbing Cao"],"meta":["January 2019IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems PP(99):1-15","DOI:10.1109/TNNLS.2018.2886199"],"references":["328110471_e-RNSP_An_Efficient_Method_for_Mining_Repetition_Negative_Sequential_Patterns","322508474_A_Selection_of_Useful_Patterns_Based_on_Multi-Criteria_Analysis_Approach","306383934_e-NSPFI_Efficient_Mining_Negative_Sequential_Pattern_from_Both_Frequent_and_Infrequent_Positive_Sequential_Patterns","303977453_Skopus_Mining_top-k_sequential_patterns_under_leverage","299986939_Discovering_Useful_Patterns_from_Multiple_Instance_Data","297750727_E-NSP_Efficient_negative_sequential_pattern_mining","290560584_Negative-GSP_An_efficient_method_for_mining_negative_sequential_patterns","286510367_Select_actionable_positive_or_negative_sequential_patterns","286331491_Mining_Top-k_distinguishing_sequential_patterns_with_gap_constraint","285408497_TKS_Efficient_Mining_of_Top-K_Sequential_Patterns","283870783_Research_on_Typical_Algorithms_in_Negative_Sequential_Pattern_Mining","283680994_Nonoccurring_Behavior_Analytics_A_New_Area","277967311_A_New_Approach_For_Discovering_Top-K_Sequential_Patterns_Based_On_The_Variety_Of_Items","275651382_Sequence_Prediction_With_Sparse_Distributed_Hyperdimensional_Coding_Applied_to_the_Analysis_of_Mobile_Phone_Use_Patterns","273693397_Manifold_Learning_for_Multivariate_Variable-Length_Sequences_With_an_Application_to_Similarity_Search","262375099_An_Efficient_Distributed_Programming_Model_for_Mining_Useful_Patterns_in_Big_Datasets","225747659_Mining_Sequential_Patterns_with_Negative_Conclusions","225266300_Zaki_MJ_SPADE_An_efficient_algorithm_for_mining_frequent_sequences_Machine_Learning_421_31-60","224242244_Coupled_Behavior_Analysis_with_Applications","221158222_Efficient_Mining_of_Event-Oriented_Negative_Sequential_Rules","220894617_An_Efficient_GA-Based_Algorithm_for_Mining_Negative_Sequential_Patterns","220515921_Efficient_mining_of_both_positive_and_negative_association_rules","316898909_Design_and_FPGA-Based_Realization_of_a_Chaotic_Secure_Video_Communication_System","304293782_SAPNSP_Select_actionable_positive_and_negative_sequential_patterns_based_on_a_contribution_metric","303976546_E-msNSP_Efficient_Negative_Sequential_Patterns_Mining_Based_on_Multiple_Minimum_Supports","303601206_Mining_Top-k_Distinguishing_Sequential_Patterns_with_Flexible_Gap_Constraints","303143011_An_algorithm_for_mining_strong_negative_fuzzy_sequential_patterns","303009936_Mining_positive_and_negative_patterns_for_relevance_feature_discovery","303009690_Mining_negative_sequential_patterns","296687568_Top_K_Sequential_Pattern_Mining_Algorithm","284688444_Mining_sequential_patterns_by_pattern-growth_The_prefixspan_approach","282052123_Approximate_pattern_matching_with_gap_constraints","271428711_Efficiently_Mining_Top-K_High_Utility_Sequential_Patterns","269667171_Mining_Positive_and_Negative_Sequential_Pattern_in_Incremental_Transaction_Databases","266486451_Extracting_Actionable_Association_Rules_from_Multiple_Datasets","264983688_An_efficient_approach_for_finding_weighted_sequential_patterns_from_sequence_databases","251936866_Support_vector_regression_and_ant_colony_optimization_for_HVAC_cooling_load_prediction","224697982_WSpan_Weighted_Sequential_pattern_mining_in_large_sequence_databases","221277118_Mining_Interesting_Infrequent_and_Frequent_Itemsets_Based_on_Minimum_Correlation_Strength","221109494_Mining_Negative_Sequential_Patterns_for_E-Commerce_Recommendations","220314321_Cao_L_In-depth_Behavior_Understanding_and_Use_the_Behavior_Informatics_Approach_Information_Science_18017_3067-3085","4234830_Mining_Actionable_Patterns_by_Role_Models","4006060_Mining_Top-_K_Frequent_Closed_Patterns_Without_Minimum_Support","2922796_TSP_Mining_Top-K_Closed_Sequential_Patterns","2843000_SPIRIT_Sequential_Pattern_Mining_with","2538180_Sequential_PAttern_Mining_using_A_Bitmap_Representation"]}
