{"id":"321873437_Advances_in_Optimal_Control_of_Differential_Systems_with_the_State_Suprema","abstract":"This paper deals with a further development of analytic techniques for Optimal Control Problems (OCPs) involving differential systems with the state suprema. Differential equations evolving with state suprema (maxima) provide a useful modelling framework for various real-world applications , namely, in electrical engineering and in biology. The corresponding dynamic models lead to Functional Differential Equations (FDEs) in the presence of state-dependent delays. We study some particular (but important) cases of optimal control processes governed by systems with sup-operator in the right hand sides of the differential equations and obtain constructive characterizations of optimal solutions. The constrained OCPs we examine are formulated assuming the (linear) feedback-type control law. The case study presented in this article constitutes a formal extension of the concept of positive dynamic systems to differential systems with the state suprema.","authors":["Erik Verriest","Vadim Azhmyakov"],"meta":["December 2017","DOI:10.1109/CDC.2017.8263748","Conference: IEEE CDC 2017At: Melbourne, Australia"],"references":["268552203_Attractive_Ellipsoids_in_Robust_Control","266410915_Nonlinear_Differential_Equations_with_Maxima_Parametric_Stability_in_Terms_of_two_Measures","315114194_A_first-order_numerical_approach_to_switched-mode_systems_optimization","311949695_On_the_Optimal_Control_of_Systems_Evolving_with_State_Suprema","301437265_Optimal_LQ-Type_Switched_Control_Design_for_a_Class_of_Linear_Systems_with_Piecewise_Constant_Inputs","271549960_Estimator_design_for_a_subsonic_rocket_car_soft_landing_based_on_state-dependent_delay_measurement","269259143_Optimal_control_of_switched-mode_dynamical_systems","266018973_Differential_equations_with_maxima","265446217_Introduction_to_dynamic_systems_Theory_models_and_applications","263973872_An_Introduction_to_Functional_Differential_Equations"]}
