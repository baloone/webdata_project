{"id":"331112729_The_application_of_the_graph_theory_for_developing_and_testing_the_software","abstract":"The graph theory, which studies the properties of the graphs, has been widely accepted as a core subject in the knowledge of computer science. In this paper, we produced a method for developing an algorithm. The effectiveness of testing is the most important factor for determining the cost and the duration of the development of the large software products with a given quality, so the cost of testing for detecting errors in the software reaches 30-40% of the total cost of its development and largely determines its quality. The most commonly used of the testing methods are regression, function, load, module, and optimization test if the graph is sufficiently complex. The graph accelerates the testing process. We see the ways that we need to test. When they cover all graph paths, the algorithm of the program is fully tested and does not need any further development.","authors":["Wessam Lahmod Nadoos","Rusul Alsaedi","Qasim Shakir Kadhim"],"meta":["January 2019International Journal of Civil Engineering and Technology 10(1):2026-2031","Project: Object Segmentation from Background of 2D Image"],"references":["325971756_Green_Synthesis_of_Silver_Polystyrene_Nano_composite_AgPS_NCs_Via_Plant_Extracts_Beginning_a_New_Era_in_Drug_Delivery","324654133_A_Continuous_Process_for_the_Preparation_Characterization_and_Study_Thermal_Properties_of_Nickel_Oxide_Nanostructure","322094704_Study_Magnetic_Properties_And_Synthesis_With_Characterization_Of_Nickel_Oxide_NiO_Nanoparticles","301716231_The_Role_of_Graph_Theory_in_System_of_Systems_Engineering","239931972_Automatic_Software_Structural_Testing_by_Using_Evolutionary_Algorithms_for_Test_Data_Generations","322095295_Synthesis_and_Characterization_of_Cu2ZnSnS4_CZTS_thin_film_by_Chemical_Bath_Deposition_CBD_for_Solar_Cell_Applications","284368398_Application_of_Graph_Theory_in_Computer_Science_and_Engineering","268887313_Computational_discrete_mathematics_Combinatorics_and_graph_theory_with_Mathematica_Reprint_of_the_2003_hardback_ed","267434259_The_Stanford_GraphBase_A_platform_for_combinatorial_computing_3rd_paperback_printing","234793242_Rapid_Testing"]}
