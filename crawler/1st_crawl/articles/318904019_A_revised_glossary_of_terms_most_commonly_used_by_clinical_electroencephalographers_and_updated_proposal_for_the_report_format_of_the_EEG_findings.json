{"id":"318904019_A_revised_glossary_of_terms_most_commonly_used_by_clinical_electroencephalographers_and_updated_proposal_for_the_report_format_of_the_EEG_findings","abstract":"This glossary includes the terms most commonly used in clinical\nEEG. It is based on the previous proposals (Chatrian et al., 1974; Noachtar et al., 1999) and includes terms necessary to describe the EEG and to generate the EEG report. All EEG phenomena should be described as precisely as possible in terms of frequency, amplitude, phase relation, waveform, localization, quantity, and variability of theseparameters (Brazier et al.,1961).Thedescriptionshouldbe inde- pendent of the recording parameters such as amplification,montages, and computer program/display. Biological and technical artifacts that interferewith an adequate EEG interpretation should either be elimi- nated or, if this is not possible, be noted in the description. The EEG report should follow a standard format that includes a\nfactual description and a clinical interpretation of the EEG record. The interpretation of the EEG requires knowledge of the patient’s age, past medical and medication history, their clinical condition during the EEG, particularly level of consciousness/vigilance and ability to co-operate. The EEG interpretation summarizes the results of the EEG and gives a clinical interpretation in light of the diagnosis and the questions posed by the referring physician. The terminology of the EEG interpretation should follow common neurological and clinical practice and use terms understandable to other physicians not specialized in EEG. A proposal for the EEG report form is given in Appendix A.","authors":["Nick Kane","Jayant Acharya","Sándor Beniczky","Luis Caboclo"],"meta":["August 2017Clinical Neurophysiology Practice 2","DOI:10.1016/j.cnp.2017.07.002","Project: Prognosis"],"references":["312617498_A_glossary_of_terms_most_commonly_used_by_clinical_electroencephalographers","305829175_American_Clinical_Neurophysiology_Society_Guideline_7_Guidelines_for_EEG_Reporting","305828267_American_Clinical_Neurophysiology_Society_Guideline_6_Minimum_Technical_Standards_for_EEG_Recording_in_Suspected_Cerebral_Death","292714057_A_glossary_of_terms_most_commonly_used_by_clinical_electroencephalographers","289322598_Guideline_7_Guidelines_for_Writing_EEG_Reports","285881487_The_AASM_Manual_for_the_Scoring_of_Sleep_and_Associated_Events_Rules_Terminology_and_Technical_Specifications","270715238_How_to_write_an_EEG_report_Dos_and_don'ts","262189134_A_Manual_Of_Standardized_Terminology_Techniques_And_Scoring_System_For_Sleep_Stages_In_Human_Subjects","260010587_Automatic_interpretation_and_writing_report_of_the_adult_waking_electroencephalogram","256161007_Preliminary_proposal_for_an_EEG_terminology_by_the_Terminology_Committee_of_the_International_Federation_for_Electroencephalography_and_Clinical_Neurophysiology"]}
