{"id":"261310819_Denormalizing_data_into_schema-free_databases","abstract":"With the proliferation of cloud service providers, the use of non-relational (NoSQL) data stores is increasing. In contrast to standard relational database schema design, which has its strong mathematical background in relational algebra and set theory, development with NoSQL data stores is largely based on empirical best practices. Furthermore, the huge variety of NoSQL variants may require different design considerations. In this paper, an algorithm is introduced to automatically derive cost and performance optimal schema in column-oriented data stores based on predefined queries and an initial relational database schema. Algorithms are given to perform database denormalization, as well as to transform the original queries to meet the newly created schemas.","authors":["Tamás Vajk","Péter Fehér","Krisztian Fekete","Hassan Charaf"],"meta":["December 2013","DOI:10.1109/CogInfoCom.2013.6719198","Conference: Cognitive Infocommunications (CogInfoCom), 2013 IEEE 4th International Conference on"],"references":["257422615_Definition_and_Synergies_of_Cognitive_Infocommunications","227331642_Modular_Architecture_for_a_Toolset_Supporting_OCL","225035500_Foundations_of_Databases","220868540_OCL_as_a_Specification_Language_for_Business_Rules_in_Database_Applications","220868499_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","220131106_Modular_architecture_for_a_toolset_supporting_OCL","200034291_Database_Systems_The_Complete_Book","321501013_Expert_Indexing_in_Oracle_Database_11g","300149106_Google_App_Engine","297287700_Amazon_web_services","266632334_Automatic_NoSQL_Schema_Development_A_Case_Study","265119132_THE_WINDOWS_AZURE_PROGRAMMING_MODEL","262365030_SimpleSQL_a_relational_layer_for_SimpleDB","254255659_Aloes-The_definitive_guide","254007441_Microsharding_a_declarative_approach_to_support_elastic_OLTP_workloads","250612456_Minimizing_the_Traversing_Steps_in_the_Code_Generated_by_OCL_20_Compilers","247931221_Database_systems_-_the_complete_book_2_ed","222443439_Inclusion_Dependencies_and_Their_Interaction_with_Functional_Dependencies","221311248_Automatic_SQL_Tuning_in_Oracle_10g","220694870_Programming_Windows_Azure_-_Programming_the_Microsoft_Cloud","220689598_CouchDB_-_The_Definitive_Guide_Time_to_Relax","220688891_Information_Modeling_and_Relational_Databases"]}
