{"id":"287390900_Schemaorg_Evolution_of_Structured_Data_on_the_Web","abstract":"SEPARATION BETWEEN CONTENT and presentation has always been one of the important design aspects of the Web. Historically, however, even though most websites were driven off structured databases, they published their content purely in HTML. Services such as Web search, price comparison, reservation engines, among others that operated on this content had access only to HTML. Applications requiring access to the structured data underlying these Web pages had to build custom extractors to convert plain HTML into structured data. These efforts were often laborious and the scrapers were fragile and error prone, breaking every time a site changed its layout.","authors":["Ramanathan Guha","Dan Brickley","Steve MacBeth"],"meta":["November 2015Queue 13(9):10-37","DOI:10.1145/2857274.2857276"],"references":["228057956_Semantic_Web","228057911_The_Semantic_Web","41586580_Information_Management_A_Proposal"]}
