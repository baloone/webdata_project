{"id":"335786530_A_note_on_Selective_line-graphs_and_partition_colorings","abstract":"We extend the definition of sandwich line-graphs, a class of auxiliary graphs the stable sets ofwhich are in 1-to-1 correspondence with the colorings of the original graph, from graphs to parti-tioned graphs. This way, we obtain a one-to-one correspondence between stable sets and partitioncolorings. \n\n(6) (PDF) A note on Selective line-graphs and partition colorings.
