{"id":"339539587_Non-Uniform_Rational_Basis_Spline_hyper-surfaces_for_metamodelling","abstract":"This study presents an original metamodelling technique based on Non-Uniform Rational Basis Spline (NURBS) hyper-surfaces. The proposed approach is able to fit general non-convex sets of target points (TPs) by extending the NURBS formalism to the N-dimensional (N-D) case. The shape of such a hyper-surface is tuned by several parameters: the number of control points (CPs), their coordinates and the related weights, the degrees of the blending functions and the knot-vector components defined along each direction. The goal of the proposed strategy is to automatically determine (i.e. without the user’s intervention) the full set of parameters defining the NURBS hyper-surface approximating a given set of TPs, without considering simplifying hypotheses. To this purpose, the problem is formulated as a constrained nonlinear programming problem (CNLPP) wherein the optimization variables are all the parameters tuning the shape of the NURBS hyper-surface. Nevertheless, when the number of CPs and the degrees of the basis functions are included among the design variables, the resulting problem is defined over a space having a changing dimension. This problem is solved by means of an original genetic algorithm able to determine, simultaneously, the optimum value of both the design space size (related to the integer variables of the NURBS hyper-surface) and the NURBS hyper-surface continuous parameters. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is shown by means of two meaningful test cases. In addition, the proposed method has been applied to a benchmark taken from the literature and the results have been compared to those provided by the Proper Generalized Decomposition method.","authors":["Yohann Audoux","Marco Montemurro","Jérôme Pailhès"],"meta":["June 2020Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering
