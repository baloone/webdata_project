{"id":"327895519_The_proposed_Gauss-Jacques_method_to_obtain_modular_inverse_matrices_variable_sized_without_a_theoretical_limit","abstract":"This paper describes de proposal of a developed method to obtain modular inverse matrices sized n x n consideringmcomputational efficiency and applications in symmetric cryptography. It is also discussed about some phenomenon in linear arithmetic spaces and some theorems found. This work is an important contribution to knowledge and direct appliance in data security problems in computer science context. Based on research and experiments conducted, it was observed that this method is precise, defined and finite, so it can be programmed in any computer language. It is concluded that this method is computationally efficient and can be implemented in specific-driven purpose hardware. Uses and applications of this method are infinite. The expressed in this abstract, and what has been found with the experiments, make this paper different from any other divulgation works belonging to the same area of knowledge.","authors":["Fausto Abraham Jacques-Garc√≠a"],"meta":["May 2018","Project: Numerical Methods to Cryptology"],"references":["44480382_Introduccion_al_algebra_A_I_Kostrikin","44369129_Curso_de_algebra_superior_A_G_Kurosch"]}
