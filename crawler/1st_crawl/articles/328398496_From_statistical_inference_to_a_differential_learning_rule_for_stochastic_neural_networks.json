{"id":"328398496_From_statistical_inference_to_a_differential_learning_rule_for_stochastic_neural_networks","abstract":"Stochastic neural networks are a prototypical computational device able to build a probabilistic representation of an ensemble of external stimuli. Building on the relationship between inference and learning, we derive a synaptic plasticity rule that relies only on delayed activity correlations, and that shows a number of remarkable features. Our delayed-correlations matching (DCM) rule satisfies some basic requirements for biological feasibility: finite and noisy afferent signals, Daleâ€™s principle and asymmetry of synaptic connections, locality of the weight update computations. Nevertheless, the DCM rule is capable of storing a large, extensive number of patterns as attractors in a stochastic recurrent neural network, under general scenarios without requiring any modification: it can deal with correlated patterns, a broad range of architectures (with or without hidden neuronal states), one-shot learning with the palimpsest property, all the while avoiding the proliferation of spurious attractors. When hidden units are present, our learning rule can be employed to construct Boltzmann machine-like generative models, exploiting the addition of hidden neurons in feature extraction and classification tasks.","authors":["Luca Saglietti","Federica Gerace","Alessandro Ingrosso","Carlo Baldassi"],"meta":["December 2018Interface focus: a theme supplement of Journal of the Royal Society interface 8(6):20180033","DOI:10.1098/rsfs.2018.0033"],"references":["322944188_From_inverse_problems_to_learning_a_Statistical_Mechanics_approach","316718563_Equilibrium_Propagation_Bridging_the_Gap_between_Energy-Based_Models_and_Backpropagation","304006302_Adaptive_Spike_Threshold_Enables_Robust_and_Temporally_Precise_Neuronal_Encoding","313400676_Normalization_as_a_canonical_neural_computation","313394353_Inverse_statistical_problems_from_the_inverse_Ising_problem_to_data_science","313188279_Neural_Networks_and_Physical_Systems_with_Emergent_Collective_Computation_Abilities","312973297_A_synaptic_model_of_memory_Long-term_potentiation_in_the_hippocampus","308964587_Computational_Tradeoffs_in_Biological_Neural_Networks_Self-Stabilizing_Winner-Take-All_Networks","301874407_Using_Firing-Rate_Dynamics_to_Train_Recurrent_Networks_of_Spiking_Model_Neurons","297867994_Fear_conditioning_induces_associative_long-term_potentiation_in_the_amygdala_vol_390_pg_604_1997"]}
