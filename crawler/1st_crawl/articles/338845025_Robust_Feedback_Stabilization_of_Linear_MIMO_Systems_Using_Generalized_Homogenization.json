{"id":"338845025_Robust_Feedback_Stabilization_of_Linear_MIMO_Systems_Using_Generalized_Homogenization","abstract":"A robust nonlinear control is designed for stabilization of linear MIMO systems. The presented control law homogenizes a linear system (without its transformation to a canonical form) with a specified degree and stabilizes it in a finite time (or with a fixed-time attraction to any compact set containing the origin) if the degree of homogeneity is negative (positive). The tuning procedure is formalized in LMI form. Performance of the approach is illustrated by numerical and experimental examples.","authors":["Konstantin Zimenko","Andrey Polyakov","Denis Efimov","Wilfrid Perruquetti"],"meta":["January 2020IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TAC.2020.2969718"],"references":["276155760_Weighted_Homogeneity_for_Time-Delay_Systems_Finite-Time_and_Independent_of_Delay_Stability","260708574_Nonlinear_Feedback_Design_for_Fixed-Time_Stabilization_of_Linear_Control_Systems","236965792_Stabilization_of_perturbed_integrator_chains_using_Lyapunov-Based_Homogeneous_Controllers","222414512_Levant_A_Homogeneity_approach_to_high-order_sliding_mode_design_Automatica_415_823-830","329511798_Generalized_Feedback_Homogenization_and_Stabilization_of_Linear_MIMO_Systems","322883826_Sliding_Mode_Control_Design_Using_Canonical_Homogeneous_Norm","322668802_Quadratic-like_stability_of_nonlinear_homogeneous_systems","312110558_On_finite-time_stabilization_of_evolution_equations_A_homogeneous_approach","293014912_On_Homogeneous_Distributed_Parameter_Systems","285028938_On_systems_of_ordinary_differential_equations_with_generalized_homogenous_right-hand_sides","284491471_On_systems_of_ordinary_differential_equations_with_generalized_uniform_homogeneous_right-hand_sides","271141391_Robust_Stabilization_of_MIMO_Systems_in_FiniteFixed_Time","264958024_The_theory_of_matrices_Vol_2_Transl_from_the_Russian_by_K_A_Hirsch_Reprint_of_the_1959_translation","259118583_Verification_of_ISS_iISS_and_IOSS_properties_applying_weighted_homogeneity","256805325_On_the_matrix_equation_XA_-_AX_Xp","246104580_Etude_de_quelques_problemes_de_stabilisation","245218058_Finite-Time_Stabilization_and_Stabilizability_of_a_Class_of_Nonlinear_Systems","222855100_Universal_stabilization_of_a_class_of_nonlinear_systems_with_homogeneous_vector_field","220259790_Finite_Time_Stability_and_Robust_Control_Synthesis_of_Uncertain_Switched_Systems","30858526_Finite-Time_Stability_of_Continuous_Autonomous_Systems"]}
