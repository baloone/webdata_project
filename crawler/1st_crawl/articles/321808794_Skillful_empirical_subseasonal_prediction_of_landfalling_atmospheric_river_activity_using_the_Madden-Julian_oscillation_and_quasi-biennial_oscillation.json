{"id":"321808794_Skillful_empirical_subseasonal_prediction_of_landfalling_atmospheric_river_activity_using_the_Madden-Julian_oscillation_and_quasi-biennial_oscillation","abstract":"p>Landfalling atmospheric river activity may be predicted up to five weeks in advance based solely on the initial state of the tropics. A team led by Bryan Mundhenk at Colorado State University constructed a scheme to predict periods of above or below normal atmospheric river activity using two prominent modes of atmospheric variability as predictors. Evaluated over regions along the west coast of North America, the researchers found opportunities when anomalous wintertime atmospheric river activity can be skillfully predicted up to five weeks into the future. The skill from this scheme can, at times, exceed that of a state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction model. As these plumes of intense water vapor transport often trigger weather extremes upon landfall, an operational version of this prediction scheme may support decision making and benefit numerous sectors of society.</p","authors":["Bryan D.
