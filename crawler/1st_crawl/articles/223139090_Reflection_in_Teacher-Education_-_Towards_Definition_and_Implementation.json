{"id":"223139090_Reflection_in_Teacher-Education_-_Towards_Definition_and_Implementation","abstract":"Reflection is claimed as a goal in many teacher preparation programs, but its definition and how it might be fostered in student teachers are problematic issues. In this article, a report is provided of a review of literature on reflection, in particular focusing on strategies which assist its development in preservice programs. Next there is outlined a research project where types of reflection have been defined and applied to an analysis of student writing. Finally, the authors propose a framework for types of reflection as a basis for further research development in teacher education.","authors":["Neville Hatton","David Smith"],"meta":["January 1995Teaching and Teacher Education 11(1):33-49","DOI:10.1016/0742-051X(94)00012-U"],"references":["303383026_On_Becoming_a_Reflective_Teacher","303382564_Teaching_Student_Teachers_to_Reflect","243787024_TEACHER_PREPARATION_STRUCTURAL_AND_CONCEPTUAL_ALTERNATIVES_1","303017961_Becoming_a_teacher","285089035_Evaluation_of_Reflective_Teaching_Outcomes","284778872_Beyond_the_lonely_choosing_will_Professional_development_in_teacher_thinking","284466331_Perceptual_differences_regarding_the_implementation_of_an_inquiry_oriented_student_teaching_curriculum","284466184_Achieving_reflectivity_through_literature","284428685_Reflection_in_teacher_education_A_study_in_progress","284230251_Building_the_knowledge_base_of_teaching","284230176_Reflecting_on_reflection","284034951_Uses_and_benefits_of_reflective_teaching","284034858_The_reflective_thought_process_John_Dewey_re-visited","274932152_Linking_Ways_of_Knowing_with_Ways_of_Being_Practical","269496031_Six_Psychological_Studies_by_Jean_Piaget","259079363_Becoming_Critical_Education_Knowledge_and_Action_Research","258160079_Teacher_Education_and_Teacher_Reflectivity","254315048_Using_Action_Research_to_Navigate_an_Unfamiliar_Teaching_Assignment","254315038_Metaphor_as_an_instructional_tool_in_encouraging_student_teacher_reflection","249751541_The_Culture_of_Teaching_Critical_Reflection_and_Change_Possibilities_and_Problems","249704553_The_Effect_of_Technical_and_Reflective_Preservice_Instruction_on_Pedagogical_Reasoning_and_Problem_Solving","249704542_Exploring_Personal_Teaching_Metaphors_in_Preservice_Teacher_Education","249704523_Reflective_Pedagogical_Thinking_How_Can_We_Promote_It_and_Measure_It","249704261_Reflecting_on_Reflective_Teaching_A_Response","249704257_Developing_and_Sustaining_Critical_Reflection_in_Teacher_Education","249704147_Field_Experience_Ideology_and_the_Development_of_Critical_Reflectivity","249704146_Reflective_Teachers_Tensions_between_Abstractions_and_Realities","249704060_Inquiring_into_Inquiry-oriented_Teacher_Education","249704057_Reflective_Teaching_and_Preservice_Teacher_Education_in_the_Netherlands","249704048_Reflecting_on_Reflective_Teaching","249134353_Teachers'_Views_of_the_Emphasis_on_Reflective_Teaching_Skills_during_Their_Student_Teaching","249032569_The_Reflective_Practitioner_and_the_Curriculum_of_Teacher_Education","249032563_Research_on_Teachers'_Thinking_its_contribution_to_educating_student_teachers_to_think_critically","249032560_Changing_Directions_in_the_Practicum_Looking_Ahead_to_the_1990s","248986048_Educating_the_reflective_teacher_An_essay_review_of_two_books_by_Donald_Schon","247981584_The_role_of_dialogue_in_providing_scaffolded_instruction","245816308_Critical_Reflection_on_Teaching_insights_from_Freire","243787023_Teachers_as_curriculum_planners","243775200_Knowledge_and_Human_Interest","242473344_Knowledge_and_Teaching_Foundations_of_the_New_Reform","240704365_First_Steps_in_Developing_A_Reflective_Approach","240327376_The_Reflective_Practitioner_How_Profes-sionals_Think_in_Action_Basic_Books","239543382_Educating_the_Reflective_Practitioner_Toward_a_New_Design_for_Teaching_and_Learning_in_the_Professions_The_Jossey-Bass_Higher_Education_Series_San_Francisco_1987","239062592_Professional_Growth_Among_Preservice_and_Beginning_Teachers","239060987_A_Restatement_of_the_Relation_of_Reflective_Thinking_To_The_Educative_Process","235616366_Stories_of_Experience_and_Narrative_Inquiry","234754753_The_Promise_of_Reflective_Practice","234745253_Personalized_Education_for_Teachers_An_Introduction_for_Teacher_Educators","234739977_Critical_Issues_in_the_Curriculum_of_Teacher_Education_Programs","234728813_Synthesis_of_Research_on_Teachers'_Reflective_Thinking","234711582_Development_of_the_Reflective_Teaching_Instrument","234632466_Assessing_Reflective_Responses_in_Journals","234620389_Tracing_the_Effects_of_Reflective_Classroom_Practice","234620098_Self-Study_The_Genesis_of_Reflection_in_Novice_Teachers","234608727_Reflective_Teaching_and_Teacher_Effectiveness_Measurement_Considerations"]}
