{"id":"269191210_Inner_and_Outer_Approximations_of_Probabilistic_Sets","abstract":"This paper proposes a set-membership method to characterize a probabilistic set, i.e., a set enclosing the true value for the parameter vector of a parametric system with a given probability. The approach assumes that all errors are independent and an interval for the error is known. To each error interval, a probability to be an outlier is provided. It is shown that characterizing the probabilistic set is a set inversion problem. The main contribution of the paper is to provide a method to characterize the inner part of the probabilistic set. As an illustration, an application to the static localization of a mobile robot is considered.","authors":["Luc Jaulin","Alexandru Stancu","Beno√Æt Desrochers"],"meta":["June 2014","DOI:10.1061/9780784413609.225","Conference: Second International Conference on Vulnerability and Risk Analysis and Management (ICVRAM) and the Sixth International Symposium on Uncertainty, Modeling, and Analysis (ISUMA)"],"references":["3319836_Computing_minimal-volume_credible_sets_using_interval_analysis_Application_to_Bayesian_estimation","3024554_Guaranteed_robust_nonlinear_minimax_estimation"]}
