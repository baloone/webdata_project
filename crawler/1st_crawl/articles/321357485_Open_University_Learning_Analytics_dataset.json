{"id":"321357485_Open_University_Learning_Analytics_dataset","abstract":"Learning Analytics focuses on the collection and analysis of learners’ data to improve their learning experience by providing informed guidance and to optimise learning materials. To support the research in this area we have developed a dataset, containing data from courses presented at the Open University (OU). What makes the dataset unique is the fact that it contains demographic data together with aggregated clickstream data of students’ interactions in the Virtual Learning Environment (VLE). This enables the analysis of student behaviour, represented by their actions. The dataset contains the information about 22 courses, 32,593 students, their assessment results, and logs of their interactions with the VLE represented by daily summaries of student clicks (10,655,280 entries). The dataset is freely available at https://analyse.kmi.open.ac.uk/open_dataset under a CC-BY 4.0 license.","authors":["Jakub Kuzilek","Martin Hlosta","Zdenek Zdráhal"],"meta":["November 2017Scientific Data 4(1):170171","DOI:10.1038/sdata.2017.171","Project: OUAnalyse"],"references":["276065720_ARX--A_Comprehensive_Tool_for_Anonymizing_Biomedical_Data","267510046_Learning_Analytics_and_Educational_Data_Mining_in_Practice_A_Systematic_Literature_Review_of_Empirical_Evidence","291748140_The_English_Indices_of_Deprivation_2015_Research_Report","229068416_A_Guide_to_Chi-squared_Testing","2566595_Transforming_Data_to_Satisfy_Privacy_Constraints"]}
