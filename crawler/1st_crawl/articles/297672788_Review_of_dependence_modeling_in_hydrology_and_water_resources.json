{"id":"297672788_Review_of_dependence_modeling_in_hydrology_and_water_resources","abstract":"Various methods have been developed over the past five decades for dependence modeling of multivariate variables in hydrology and water resources, but there has been no overall review of techniques commonly used in the field. This paper, therefore, introduces several methods focusing on dependence structure modeling, including parametric distribution, entropy, copula, and nonparametric. Recent advances in modeling dependences mainly reside in nonlinear dependence modeling (including extreme dependence) with flexible marginal distributions, and in high-dimension dependence modeling via the vine copula construction with flexible dependence structures. Strengths and limitations of different methods and avenues for future research, such as dependence modeling in a changing climate, are discussed to aid water resource planners and managers in the selection and application of suitable techniques.","authors":["Zengchao Hao","Vijay P.
