{"id":"352532636_Cooperative_Grasping_and_Transport_Using_Multiple_Quadrotors","abstract":"In this paper, we consider the problem of controlling multiple quadrotor robots that cooperatively grasp and transport a payload in three dimensions.We model the quadrotors both individually and as a group rigidly attached to a payload. We propose individual robot control laws defined with respect to the payload that stabilize the payload along three-dimensional trajectories. We detail the design of a gripping mechanism attached to each quadrotor that permits autonomous grasping of the payload. An experimental study with teams of quadrotors cooperatively grasping, stabilizing, and transporting payloads along desired three-dimensional trajectories is presented with performance analysis over many trials for different payload configurations.","authors":["Daniel Mellinger","Michael Shomin","Nathan Michael","Vijay Kumar"],"meta":["January 2013","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-32723-0âˆ–_39","In book: Distributed Autonomous Robotic Systems (pp.545-558)"],"references":["314578997_Scaling_hard_vertical_surfaces_with_compliant_microspine_arrays","228634257_Quadrotor_Helicopter_Trajectory_Tracking_Control","224705216_Energy-efficient_Autonomous_Four-rotor_Flying_Robot_Controlled_at_1_kHz","220062277_Landing_and_Perching_on_Vertical_Surfaces_with_Microspines_for_Small_Unmanned_Air_Vehicles","37439805_Design_and_Control_of_quadrotors_with_application_to_autonomous_flying","310830377_Cooperative_manipulation_and_transportation_with_aerial_robots","257400324_The_Distributed_Flight_Array","243731751_Kinematic_and_Force_Analysis_of_Articulated_Mechanical_Hands","224173788_The_GRASP_multiple_micro-uav_testbed","224156345_The_Distributed_Flight_Array","220122264_Planning_and_Control_for_Cooperative_Manipulation_and_Transportation_with_Aerial_Robots"]}
