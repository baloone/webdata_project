Sanskrit, an alphabetic script is used by over 500 million people all over the world. Handwritten scripts of Sanskrit are complicated compared to other language scripts. The greatest challenge in the field of image processing is to recognize the documents both in printed and handwritten format. The character recognition is a standout amongst the most generally utilized biometric attributes for authentication of persons and document. In this study, proposed an offline handwritten Sanskirt character recognition framework utilizing multilayer feed forward neural network. Efficiency and accuracy are the main parameters in the field of handwritten character recognition. Intelligent Character Recognition (ICR) is a procedure used to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of theoff line handwritten Sanskirt character recognition system which is involved various technologies aimed at the analysis and recognition of handwritten Sanskirt characters from an electronic image. This framework will be suitable for converting handwritten documents into the structural content form and recognizing handwritten characters. A novel approach to achieve a very fast recognition rate and high accuracy rates compare with other recognition systems.","authors":["R.
