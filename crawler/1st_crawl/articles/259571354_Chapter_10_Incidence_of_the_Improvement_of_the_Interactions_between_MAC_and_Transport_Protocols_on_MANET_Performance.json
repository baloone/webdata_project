{"id":"259571354_Chapter_10_Incidence_of_the_Improvement_of_the_Interactions_between_MAC_and_Transport_Protocols_on_MANET_Performance","abstract":"In this chapter, the authors present an improvement to the interactions between MAC (Medium Access Control) and TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) protocols for better performance in MANET. This improvement is called IB-MAC (Improvement of Backoff algorithm of MAC protocol) and proposes a new backoff algorithm. The principle idea is to make dynamic the maximal limit of the backoff interval according to the number of nodes and their mobility. IB-MAC reduces the number of collisions between nodes. It is also able to distinguish between packet losses due to collisions and those due to nodes' mobility. The evaluation of IB-MAC solution and the study of its incidences on MANET performance are done with TCP New Reno transport protocol. The authors varied the network conditions such as the network density and the mobility of nodes. Obtained results are satisfactory, and they showed that IB-MAC can outperform not only MAC standard, but also similar techniques that have been proposed in the literature like MAC-LDA and MAC-WCCP.","authors":["Sofiane Hamrioui","Jaime Lloret","Pascal Lorenz","Mustapha Lalam"],"meta":["January 2014","DOI:10.4018/978-1-4666-5170-8.ch010"],"references":["312786712_Distinguishing_congestion_losses_from_wireless_transmission_losses_A_negative_result","264569879_Radio_Propagation_Fundamentals","260326348_Analysis_of_the_Request_to_SendClear_to_Send_Exchange_in_WLAN_Over_Fiber_Networks","258438256_Understanding_GPS_Principles_And_Applications","247699785_TCP-BuS_Improving_TCP_performance_over_wireless_ad_hoc_networks","243768169_NS_Notes_and_Documentation","243134177_Random_waypoint_model_in_n-dimensional_space","242505628_Random_Early_Detection_Gateways_for_Congestion_AIvoidance","242361999_The_Ad_Hoc_On-demand_Distance-vector_Protocol","240793818_Experimental_Study_of_Hidden-node_Problem_in_IEEE80211_Wireless_Networks","236661148_The_NewReno_Modification_to_TCP's_Fast_Recovery_Algorithm","234781455_Improving_TCPIP_performance_over_Wireless_Networks","234779849_Incidence_of_the_improvement_of_the_transport_MAC_protocols_interactions_on_MANET_performance","233893330_The_New_Reno_Modification_to_TCP's_Fast_Recovery_Algorithm","235559081_Wireless_LAN_medium_access_control_MAC_physical_layer_PHY_specifications_Amendment_1_High-Speed_Physical_Layer_in_the_5_GHz_Band"]}
