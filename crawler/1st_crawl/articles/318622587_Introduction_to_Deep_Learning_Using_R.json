{"id":"318622587_Introduction_to_Deep_Learning_Using_R","abstract":"Understand deep learning, the nuances of its different models, and where these models can be applied.\n\nThe abundance of data and demand for superior products/services have driven the development of advanced computer science techniques, among them image and speech recognition. Introduction to Deep Learning Using R provides a theoretical and practical understanding of the models that perform these tasks by building upon the fundamentals of data science through machine learning and deep learning. This step-by-step guide will help you understand the disciplines so that you can apply the methodology in a variety of contexts. All examples are taught in the R statistical language, allowing students and professionals to implement these techniques using open source tools.\n\nWhat You Will Learn:\n\n• Understand the intuition and mathematics that power deep learning models\n• Utilize various algorithms using the R programming language and its packages\n• Use best practices for experimental design and variable selection\n• Practice the methodology to approach and effectively solve problems as a data scientist\n• Evaluate the effectiveness of algorithmic solutions and enhance their predictive power","authors":["Taweh Beysolow II"],"meta":["January 2017","DOI:10.1007/978-1-4842-2734-3","ISBN: 978-1-4842-2733-6"],"references":[]}
