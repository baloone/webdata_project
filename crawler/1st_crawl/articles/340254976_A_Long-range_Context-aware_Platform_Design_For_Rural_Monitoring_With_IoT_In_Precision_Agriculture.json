{"id":"340254976_A_Long-range_Context-aware_Platform_Design_For_Rural_Monitoring_With_IoT_In_Precision_Agriculture","abstract":"The Internet of Things (IoT) applications has been developing greatly in recent years to solve communication problems, especially in rural areas. Within the IoT, the context-awareness paradigm, especially in precision agricultural practices, has come to a state of the planning of production time. As smart cities approach, the smart environment approach also increases its place in IoT applications and has dominated research in recent years in literature. In this study, soil and environmental information were collected in 17 km diameter in rural area with developed Long Range (LoRa) based context-aware platform. With the developed sensor and actuator control unit, soil moisture at 5 cm and 30 cm depth and soil surface temperature information were collected and the communication performance was investigated. During the study, the performance measurements of the developed Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) enabled Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) gateway were also performed.","authors":["Deniz Taşkin","Selçuk Yazar"],"meta":["March 2020International Journal of Computers, Communications & Control (IJCCC) 15(2)","DOI:10.15837/ijccc.2020.2.3821"],"references":["335516688_IoT_technologies_for_smart_cities","334103818_Decision_Support_System_for_Variable_Rate_Irrigation_Based_on_UAV_Multispectral_Remote_Sensing","331679382_IoT_Based_Automated_Greenhouse_Monitoring_System","331425361_LoRa_WAN_for_Wind_Turbine_Monitoring_Prototype_and_Practical_Deployment","329648847_Exploration_of_the_LoRa_Technology_Utilization_Possibilities_in_Healthcare_IoT_Devices","329131307_IoT-Based_Strawberry_Disease_Prediction_System_for_Smart_Farming","324434454_Smart_city_pilot_projects_using_LoRa_and_IEEE802154_technologies","324145570_The_Need_of_Multidisciplinary_Approaches_and_Engineering_Tools_for_the_Development_and_Implementation_of_the_Smart_City_Paradigm","330253249_An_Automated_Low_Cost_IoT_based_Fertilizer_Intimation_System_for_Smart_Agriculture","323704695_A_deep_belief_network_for_electricity_utilisation_feature_analysis_of_air_conditioners_using_a_smart_IoT_platform"]}
