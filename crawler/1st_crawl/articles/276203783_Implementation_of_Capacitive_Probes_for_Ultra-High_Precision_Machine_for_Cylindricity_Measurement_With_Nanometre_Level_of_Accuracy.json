{"id":"276203783_Implementation_of_Capacitive_Probes_for_Ultra-High_Precision_Machine_for_Cylindricity_Measurement_With_Nanometre_Level_of_Accuracy","abstract":"Capacitive probes are widely used on new ultra-high precision machines to perform measurements with an uncertainty of few nanometres, especially for cylindricity measuring machines. For this reason, their in-situ calibration has to be carried out by using a specific structure. Therefore, a preliminary high precision set-up has been designed and manufactured to investigate the behaviour and the implementation of the capacitive probes. Both the number and the locations of the capacitive probes in the set-up are presented and detailed, to justify how they minimize the homogenous thermal expansion effects. The experimental set-up allows validating the insitu calibration principle of the capacitive probes with regard to the laser interferometers. The recorded residual errors are about 2 nm over the 80 Î¼m-travel range. The effect of a transverse offset of the capacitive probe from the cylinder's generatrix has been investigated both experimentally and theoretically, as well as they present a good agreement.","authors":["Alain Vissiere","Hichem Nouira","Mohamed Damak","Olivier Gibaru"],"meta":["February 2015International Journal of Precision Engineering and Manufacturing 16(5):883-893","DOI:10.1007/s12541-015-0116-z"],"references":["280217861_Mesure_de_cylindricite_de_tres_haute_exactitude_developpement_d'une_nouvelle_machine_de_reference","254499688_Concept_and_architecture_of_a_new_apparatus_for_cylindrical_form_measurement_with_a_nanometric_level_of_accuracy","254499411_A_newly_conceived_cylinder_measuring_machine_and_methods_that_eliminate_the_spindle_errors","316637857_Fundamental_Principles_of_Engineering_Nanometrology","311742555_Precision_Spindle_Metrology","263238623_Fundamental_Principles_of_Engineering_Nanometrology","260559155_Evaluation_of_roundness_error_using_a_new_method_based_on_a_small_displacement_screw","256969684_Investigation_of_the_influence_of_the_main_error_sources_on_the_capacitive_displacement_measurements_with_cylindrical_artefacts","254691109_ANALYSIS_AND_APPLICATION_OF_CAPACITIVE_DISPLACEMENT_SENSORS_TO_CURVED_SURFACES","252303292_Short_course_in_precision_machine_design"]}
