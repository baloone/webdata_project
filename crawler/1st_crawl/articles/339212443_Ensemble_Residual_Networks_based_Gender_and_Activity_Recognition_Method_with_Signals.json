{"id":"339212443_Ensemble_Residual_Networks_based_Gender_and_Activity_Recognition_Method_with_Signals","abstract":"Nowadays, deep learning is one of the popular research area of the computer sciences and many deep networks have been proposed to solve artificial intelligence and machine learning problems. Residual Networks (ResNet) for instance ResNet18, ResNet50, ResNet101 have been widely used deep network in the literature. In this paper, a novel ResNets based signal recognition method is presented. In this study, ResNet18, ResNet50 and ResNet101 are utilized as feature extractor and each network extracts 1000 features. The extracted features are concatenated and 3000 features are obtained. In the feature selection phase, 1000 most discriminative features are selected using ReliefF and these selected features are used as input for 3rd degree polynomial (cubic) activation based support vector machine. The proposed method achieved 99.96% and 99.61% classification accuracy rates for gender and activity recognitions respectively. These results clearly demonstrate that the proposed pre-trained ensemble ResNet based method achieved high success rate for sensors signals.","authors":["Turker Tuncer","Fatih Ertam","Sengul Dogan","Emrah Aydemir"],"meta":["March 2020The Journal of Supercomputing 76(2020):2119â€“2138","DOI:10.1007/s11227-020-03205-1"],"references":["337514687_Hand-crafted_Features_vs_Residual_Networks_for_Human_Activities_Recognition_using_Accelerometer","335984759_A_Real-Time_Patient_Monitoring_Framework_for_Fall_Detection","335500024_On_the_Homogenization_of_Heterogeneous_Inertial-Based_Databases_for_Human_Activity_Recognition","335088340_Practical_Considerations_for_Accuracy_Evaluation_in_Sensor-Based_Machine_Learning_and_Deep_Learning","333156194_Attention-Based_Convolutional_Neural_Network_for_Weakly_Labeled_Human_Activities'_Recognition_With_Wearable_Sensors","332804888_Wearable_Sensor-Based_Human_Activity_Recognition_via_Two-Layer_Diversity-Enhanced_Multiclassifier_Recognition_Method","332488444_Human_Activity_Recognition_Based_on_Wearable_Sensor_Using_Hierarchical_Deep_LSTM_Networks","333643493_Outlier_Detection_in_Wearable_Sensor_Data_for_Human_Activity_Recognition_HAR_Based_on_DRNNs","331360484_A_simple_burn_wound_severity_assessment_classifier_based_on_spatial_frequency_domain_imaging_SFDI_and_machine_learning","329157677_Human_Activity_Recognition_Based_on_Single_Sensor_Square_HV_Acceleration_Images_and_Convolutional_Neural_Networks"]}
