{"id":"287505486_The_online_parameter_identification_of_chaotic_behaviour_in_permanent_magnet_synchronous_motor_by_Self-Adaptive_Learning_Bat-inspired_algorithm","abstract":"One of the main issues in engineering is the identification of nonlinear systems. Because of the complicated as well as unexpected behaviours of these chaotic systems, it is introduced as special nonlinear systems. A minute change in the primary conditions of such systems would lead to significant variations in their behaviours. On the other hand, due to simple structure of Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors (PMSM) and its high applications in industry, the use of this machine is dramatically increasing these days. The reflection of a chaotic behaviour as the Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor is positioned in a particular area. In the model of PMSM, the exact parameters of the system are required to properly control and spot the error. In this paper, Self-Adaptive Learning Bat-inspired Optimization algorithm is used for solving both offline and online parameter estimation problems for this chaotic system. In addition, noise is considered as one of influential factors in control of PMSM. According to simulation results, it can be claimed that the proposed algorithm is a very powerful algorithm for online parameter identification for PMSM.","authors":["Abdolah Rahimi","Farhad Bavafa","Sara Aghababaei","Mohammad Hassan Khooban"],"meta":["June 2016International Journal of Electrical Power & Energy Systems 78:285-291","DOI:10.1016/j.ijepes.2015.11.084"],"references":["286319205_Adaptive_fuzzy_sliding_mode_control_for_synchronization_of_uncertain_non-identical_chaotic_systems_using_bacterial_foraging_optimization","283563045_A_simple_and_intelligent_online_parameter_identification_of_nonlinear_chaotic_systems","265844723_Modifying_Power_Quality's_Indices_of_Load_by_Presenting_an_Adaptive_Method_based_on_Hebb_Learning_Algorithm_for_Controlling_DVR","264416989_Swarm_optimization_tuned_Mamdani_fuzzy_controller_for_diabetes_delayed_model","260891705_Dynamic_voltage_restorer_control_using_bi-objective_optimisation_to_improve_power_quality's_indices","259140698_Design_of_optimal_Mamdani-type_fuzzy_controller_for_nonholonomic_wheeled_mobile_robots","254062259_Bat-Inspired_Optimization_Approach_for_the_Brushless_DC_Wheel_Motor_Problem","220204190_Parameter_Identification_Based_on_a_Modified_PSO_Applied_to_Suspension_System","45913690_A_New_Metaheuristic_Bat-Inspired_Algorithm","3323826_Bifurcations_and_chaos_in_a_permanent-magnet_synchronous_motor","287335363_Introduction","285860628_Optimal_intelligent_control_for_HVAC_systems","279419884_Optimal_type-2_fuzzy_controller_for_HVAC_systems","278108403_A_robust_and_simple_optimal_type_II_fuzzy_sliding_mode_control_strategy_for_a_class_of_nonlinear_chaotic_systems","274406259_A_new_intelligent_online_fuzzy_tuning_approach_for_multi-area_load_frequency_control_Self_Adaptive_Modified_Bat_Algorithm","271913525_Design_of_Optimal_Self-Regulation_Mamdani-Type_Fuzzy_Inference_Controller_for_Type_I_Diabetes_Mellitus","265844601_A_novel_self-tuning_control_method_based_on_regulated_bi-objective_emotional_learning_controller's_structure_with_TLBO_algorithm_to_control_DVR_compensator","265253585_Intelligent_stochastic_framework_to_solve_the_reconfiguration_problem_from_the_reliability_view","262362028_Design_an_intelligent_proportional-derivative_PD_feedback_linearization_control_for_nonholonomic-wheeled_mobile_robot","259635617_An_optimal_type_II_fuzzy_sliding_mode_control_design_for_a_class_of_nonlinear_systems","257633413_Adaptive_control_of_a_chaotic_permanent_magnet_synchronous_motor","257591028_Synchronization_of_permanent_magnet_electric_motors_New_nonlinear_advanced_results","243259874_Control_of_chaos_in_permanent_magnet_synchronous_motor_by_using_optimal_Lyapunov_exponents_placement","238525076_Online_Identification_of_PMSM_Parameters_Parameter_Identifiability_and_Estimator_Comparative_Study","229328305_Complex_dynamics_in_a_permanent-magnet_synchronous_motor_model","226509409_Web-based_Virtual_Research_Environments","222201299_Nonlinear_system_identification_and_control_using_a_real-coded_genetic_algorithm","4180219_Performances_comparison_of_induction_motors_and_surface_mounted_PM_motor_for_POD_marine_propulsion","4022590_An_Improved_Control_Method_of_Buried-Type_IPM_Bearingless_Motors_Considering_Magnetic_Saturation_and_Magnetic_Pull_Variation","3279002_Control_Characteristics_and_Speed_Controller_Design_for_a_High_Performance_Permanent_Magnet_Synchronous_Motor_Drive","2524049_Triblock_Copolymer_Theory_Ordered_ABC_Lamellar_Phase"]}
