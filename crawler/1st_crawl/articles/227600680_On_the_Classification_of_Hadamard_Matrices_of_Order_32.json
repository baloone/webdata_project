{"id":"227600680_On_the_Classification_of_Hadamard_Matrices_of_Order_32","abstract":"All equivalence classes of Hadamard matrices of order at most 28 have been found by 1994. Order 32 is where a combinatorial explosion occurs on the number of Hadamard matrices. We find all equivalence classes of Hadamard matrices of order 32 which are of certain types. It turns out that there are exactly 13, 680, 757 Hadamard matrices of one type and 26, 369 such matrices of another type. Based on experience with the classification of Hadamard matrices of smaller order, it is expected that the number of the remaining two types of these matrices, relative to the total number of Hadamard matrices of order 32, to be insignificant. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
