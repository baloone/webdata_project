{"id":"337474348_Hyperhomographies_on_Krasner_Hyperfields","abstract":"In this paper, we introduce generalized homographic transformations as hyperhomographies over Krasner hyperfields.These particular algebraic hyperstructues are quotient structures of classical fields modulo normal groups. Besides, we define some hyperoperations and investigate the properties of the derived hypergroups and H v-groups associated with the considered hyperhomographies. They are equipped hyperhomographies obtained as quotient sets of nondegenerate hyperhomographies modulo a special equivalence. Thus the symmetrical property of the equivalence relations plays a fundamental role in this constructions.","authors":["Vahid Vahedi","Morteza Jafarpour","Irina Cristea"],"meta":["November 2019Symmetry 11(12)","DOI:10.3390/sym11121442","Project: Extension of elliptic curves on Krasner hyperfields"],"references":["336096093_Superring_of_Polynomials_over_a_Hyperring","332262351_Extension_of_elliptic_curves_on_Krasner_hyperfields","322550659_Fundamental_relation_on_m-idempotent_hyperrings","321154361_Height_of_hyperideals_in_noetherian_krasner_hyperrings","317222620_Multiplicative_hyperring_of_fractions_and_coprime_hyperideals","287215669_Algebraic_Geometry_Over_Hyperrings","313833993_Hyperrings_with_n-ary_composition_hyperoperation","311362080_On_the_existence_of_hyperrings_associated_to_arithmetic_functions","267661462_Applications_of_Hyperstructure_Theory","266014989_Sugli_Iperanelli_Moltiplicativi"]}
