{"id":"326039952_Search_In_Artificial_Intelligence_Problem_Solving","abstract":"In this paper, search methods/ techniques in problem solving using artificial intelligence (A.I) are surveyed. An overview of the definitions, dimensions and development of A.I in the light of search for solution to problems were undertaken. Dimensions and relevance of search in A.I research were reviewed. A classification of search in terms of depth of known parameters of search was also examined. Finally, the prospects of search in AI research were highlighted. Search is observed to be the common thread binding most AI problem-solving strategies together.","authors":["Vincent Chukwudi Chijindu"],"meta":["January 2012"],"references":["266287039_Intelligent_Agents_-_Autonomy_Issues","220546579_Theory_Formation_by_Heuristic_Search","272161464_Artificial_Intelligence_A_Modern_Approach_Second_Edition","245497885_Artificial_Intelligence_Structures_and_Strategies_for_Complex_Problem-Solving_4rd_edition","243448626_On_Representations_of_Problems_of_Reasoning_about_Actions","236389661_Heuristics_Intelligent_Search_Strategies_for_Computer_Problem_Solving","236025154_Artificial_Intelligence_A_New_Synthesis"]}
