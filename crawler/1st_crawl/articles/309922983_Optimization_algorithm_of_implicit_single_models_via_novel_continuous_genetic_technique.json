{"id":"309922983_Optimization_algorithm_of_implicit_single_models_via_novel_continuous_genetic_technique","abstract":"In this paper, we present a novel optimization technique, called the continuous genetic algorithm (CGA) to approximate a smooth optimal solutions of a class of implicit single models arising in computer science and engineering. The curves are used throughout the evolution of the algorithm to obtain the required nodal values. The technique methodology provides the solution in the form of a rapidly convergent series with easily computable components using symbolic computation software. Numerical simulations are given to illustrate the performance, potentialityand applicability of the proposed algorithm.The results reveal that the simulated algorithm is very effective, straightforward and powerful to handle such issues in physical application.","authors":["Bushra Alsmadi"],"meta":["October 2016"],"references":["308349269_Numerical_investigation_for_handling_fractional-order_Rabinovich-Fabrikant_model_using_the_multistep_approach","305210366_Solutions_of_Uncertain_Volterra_Integral_Equations_by_Fitted_Reproducing_Kernel_Hilbert_Space_Method","303903611_Application_of_reproducing_kernel_algorithm_for_solving_second-order_two-point_fuzzy_boundary_value_problems","273505083_A_Novel_Representation_of_the_Exact_Solution_for_Differential_Algebraic_Equations_System_Using_Residual_Power-Series_Method","316862194_Numerical_solution_of_fuzzy_differential_equation_using_continuous_genetic_algorithms","308183547_Numerical_Multistep_Approach_for_Solving_Fractional_Partial_Differential_Equations","303730447_Numerical_investigations_for_systems_of_second-order_periodic_boundary_value_problems_using_reproducing_kernel_method","274565291_Numerical_solutions_of_fuzzy_differential_equations_using_reproducing_kernel_Hilbert_space_method","270646363_A_general_form_of_the_generalized_Taylor's_formula_with_some_applications","265565680_Numerical_solution_of_boundary_value_problems_for_ordinary_differential_equations","265335697_A_novel_multistep_generalized_differential_transform_method_for_solving_fractional-order_Lu_chaotic_and_hyperchaotic_systems","264711827_An_Efficient_Analytical_Method_for_Solving_Singular_Initial_Value_Problems_of_Nonlinear_Systems","263714215_Analytical_Study_of_Fractional-Order_Multiple_Chaotic_FitzHugh-Nagumo_Neurons_Model_Using_Multistep_Generalized_Differential_Transform_Method","263714084_Research_Article_Analytical_Study_of_Fractional-Order_Multiple_Chaotic_FitzHugh-Nagumo_Neurons_Model_Using_Multistep_Generalized_Differential_Transform_Method","263085687_Numerical_algorithm_for_solving_two-point_second-order_periodic_boundary_value_problems_for_mixed_integro-differential_equations"]}
