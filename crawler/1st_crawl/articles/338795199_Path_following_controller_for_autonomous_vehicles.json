{"id":"338795199_Path_following_controller_for_autonomous_vehicles","abstract":"In recent years vehicles with high level of\nautomation are becoming more popular which is expected to\ncontinue in the future. Advanced driving assistance systems are\nincreasingly taking control of the vehicle, starting with the\nsupport of the driving task. Automated or highly automated\nvehicles are expected to follow a planned road safely. In this\npaper, the authors aim to improve the accuracy of path\nfollowing by developing a new control strategy. The controller\nincludes both pure pursuit and Stanley methods, the operation\nof the controller is based on the geometry of the vehicle and the\npath; the key is the proper weighting between two controllers.\nThe performance of the combined path following controller was\nmeasured on a demonstration vehicle.","authors":["Ádám Domina","Viktor Tihanyi"],"meta":["November 2019","DOI:10.1109/ICCVE45908.2019.8964960","Conference: 2019 IEEE International Conference on Connected Vehicles and Expo (ICCVE)"],"references":["335747292_COMBINED_PATH_FOLLOWING_CONTROLLER_FOR_AUTONOMOUS_VEHICLES","327976435_Legal_Barriers_of_Utilization_of_Autonomous_Vehicles_as_Part_of_Green_Mobility","327976418_The_Significance_and_Effect_of_the_Traffic_System_Signaling_to_the_Environment_Present_and_Future_Traffic","311389363_Modelling_and_Control_Strategies_in_Path_Tracking_Control_for_Autonomous_Ground_Vehicles_A_Review_of_State_of_the_Art_and_Challenges","3032841_Trajectory-Tracking_and_Path-Following_of_Underactuated_Autonomous_Vehicles_With_Parametric_Modeling_Uncertainty","335497670_Modelling_the_dynamic_behavior_of_the_steering_system_for_low_speed_autonomous_path_tracking","334859076_Comparison_of_path_following_controllers_for_autonomous_vehicles","328992230_Adaptive_Trajectory_Tracking_Controller_for_an_Armoured_Vehicle_Hardware-in-the-Ioop_Simulation","318696468_Hybrid_controller_approach_for_an_autonomous_ground_vehicle_path_tracking_problem","301817071_A_Survey_of_Motion_Planning_and_Control_Techniques_for_Self-Driving_Urban_Vehicles","292283882_Vehicle_Dynamics_Theory_and_Application","255036858_Automatic_Steering_Methods_for_Autonomous_Automobile_Path_Tracking"]}
