{"id":"303905052_A_simple_necessary_and_sufficient_condition_for_the_enrichment_of_the_Crouzeix-Raviart_element","abstract":"We provide a simple condition, which is both necessary and sufficient, that guarantees the existence of an\nenriched Crouzeix-Raviart element. Our main result shows that the latter\ncan be easily expressed in terms of the approximation error in a multivariate generalized trapezoidal type cubature formula.\nFurthermore, we\nderive simple explicit formulas for its associated basis functions, and then prove how to use them to characterize all\nadmissible added degrees of freedom, that generate well defined enriched Crouzeix-Raviart elements. We also show that the approximation error using the proposed\nenriched element can be written as\nthe error of the (non-enriched) Crouzeix-Raviart element plus a perturbation that depends on the enrichment function.\nFinally, we estimate the approximation error in $L^2$ norm, with explicit constants\nin both two and three dimensions. A complement to this result is also given for any dimension.","authors":["Mostafa Bachar","Guessab Allal"],"meta":["November 2016Applicable Analysis and Discrete Mathematics 10(00):12-12","DOI:10.2298/AADM160610012B","Project: Fixed Point Theory of Monotone Mappings"],"references":["281380890_Variational_Methods_for_the_Solution_of_Problems_of_Equilibrium_and_Vibrations","267668976_The_finite_element_method_for_elliptic_problems_Metod_konechnykh_ehlementov_dlya_ehllipticheskikh_zadach_Transl_from_the_English_by_B_I_Kvasov","265373941_Conforming_and_nonconforming_finite_element_methods_for_solving_the_stationary_Stokes_equations_I","264162676_Forty_Years_of_the_Crouzeix-Raviart_Element","262211825_The_P_1_mod_Element_A_New_Nonconforming_Finite_Element_for_Convection-Diffusion_Problems","261916578_A_simple_nonconforming_quadrilateral_finite_element","259578418_The_Enriched_Crouzeix-Raviart_Elements_are_Equivalent_to_the_Raviart-Thomas_Elements","248071340_Theory_Practice_of_Finite_Elements","244962834_A_nonconforming_element_for_the_Reissner-Mindlin_plate","243767598_Variational_Methods_for_the_Solution_of_Problems_of_Equilibrium_and_Vibration"]}
