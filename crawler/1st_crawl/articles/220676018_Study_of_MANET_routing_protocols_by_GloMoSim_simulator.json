{"id":"220676018_Study_of_MANET_routing_protocols_by_GloMoSim_simulator","abstract":"This paper compares Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV), Dynamic Source Routing (DSR), and Wireless Routing Protocol (WRP) for MANETs to Distance Vector protocol to better understand the major characteristics of the three routing protocols, using a parallel discrete event-driven simulator, GloMoSim. MANET (mobile ad hoc network) is a multi-hop wireless network without a fixed infrastructure. There has not been much work that compares the performance of the MANET routing protocols, especially to Distance Vector protocol, which is a general routing protocol developed for legacy wired networks. The results of our experiments brought us nine key findings. Followings are some of our key findings: (1) AODV is most sensitive to changes in traffic load in the messaging overhead for routing. The number of control packets generated by AODV became 36 times larger when the traffic load was increased. For Distance Vector, WRP and DSR, their increase was approximately 1.3 times, 1.1 times and 7.6 times, respectively. (2) Two advantages common in the three MANET routing protocols compared to classical Distance Vector protocol were identified to be scalability for node mobility in end-to-end delay and scalability for node density in messaging overhead. (3) WRP resulted in the shortest delay and highest packet delivery rate, implying that WRP will be the best for real-time applications in the four protocols compared. WRP demonstrated the best traffic-scalability; control overhead will not increase much when traffic load increases.","authors":["Ashwini K.
