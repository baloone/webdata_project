{"id":"295244743_An_Effective_Collaborative_Mobile_Weighted_Clustering_Schemes_for_Energy_Balancing_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","abstract":"Collaborative strategies for mobile sensor nodes ensure the efficiency and the robustness of data processing, while limiting the required communication bandwidth. In order to solve the problem of pipeline inspection and oil leakage monitoring, a collaborative weighted mobile sensing scheme is proposed. By adopting a weighted mobile sensing scheme, the adaptive collaborative clustering protocol can realize an even distribution of energy load among the mobile sensor nodes in each round, and make the best use of battery energy. A detailed theoretical analysis and experimental results revealed that the proposed protocol is an energy efficient collaborative strategy such that the sensor nodes can communicate with a fusion center and produce high power gain.","authors":["Chengpei Tang","Sanesy Kumcr Shokla","George Modhawar","Qiang Wang"],"meta":["February 2016Sensors 16(2):261","DOI:10.3390/s16020261"],"references":["269996405_An_Improved_Lower_Bound_for_Bayesian_Network_Structure_Learning","266871944_Evaluation_of_Routing_Protocols_for_Internet-Enabled_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","265842416_Tightening_Bounds_for_Bayesian_Network_Structure_Learning","261447661_WSN_dynamic_clustering_for_oil_slicks_monitoring","313718851_Design_of_Structure-Free_and_Energy-Balanced_Data_Aggregation_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","285480574_PEGASIS_Power-efficient_gathering_in_sensor_information_systems","278647898_Clusterhead_Selection_Using_Multiple_Attribute_Decision_Making_MADM_Approach_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","261237510_A_multi-sensor_WSN_backbone_for_museum_monitoring_and_surveillance","260657479_Nodes_self-scheduling_approach_for_maximising_wireless_sensor_network_lifetime_based_on_remaining_energy","260303648_Novel_Industrial_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_for_Machine_Condition_Monitoring_and_Fault_Diagnosis"]}
