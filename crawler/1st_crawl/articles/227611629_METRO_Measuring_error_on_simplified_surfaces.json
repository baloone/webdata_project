{"id":"227611629_METRO_Measuring_error_on_simplified_surfaces","abstract":"This paper presents a new tool, Metro, designed to compensate for a deficiency in many simplification methods proposed in literature. Metro allows one to compare the difference between a pair of surfaces (e.g. a triangulated mesh and its simplified representation) by adopting a surface sampling approach. It has been designed as a highly general tool, and it does no assumption on the particular approach used to build the simplified representation. It returns both numerical results (meshes areas and volumes, maximum and mean error, etc.) and visual results, by coloring the input surface according to the approximation error.","authors":["Paolo Cignoni","Claudio Rocchini","Roberto Scopigno"],"meta":["June 1998Computer Graphics Forum 17(2):167 - 174","DOI:10.1111/1467-8659.00236","SourceDBLP"],"references":["246715769_Lod_and_multiresolution-principles_and_applications","225075920_Multi-resolution_3D_approximation_for_rendering_complex_scenes","225075906_Simplification_Envelopes","225075888_Decimation_of_triangle_meshes","240270640_Survey_of_surface_simplification_algorithms","223552126_Geometric_computing_and_uniform_grid_technique","220943457_Mesh_Reduction_with_Error_Control","220721048_Mesh_Optimization","220692365_The_inventor_mentor_-_programming_object-oriented_3D_graphics_with_Open_Inventor_release_2","220507238_Full-range_Approximation_of_Triangulated_Polyhedra"]}
