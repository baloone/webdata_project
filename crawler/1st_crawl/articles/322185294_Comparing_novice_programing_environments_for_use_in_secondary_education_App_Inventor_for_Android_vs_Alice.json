Coding acquisition is necessary as it is used in a wide range of occupations. However, computer programming is difficult to learn and programming courses often have high drop-out rates. Novice programmers suffer from a wide range of difficulties and deficits. Research in teaching and learning programming across different countries and educational contexts reveal that novice programmers face the same challenges in their efficiency of writing, debugging and running programs. These difficulties have led those involved in the teaching of programming to further consider the most effective ways that can facilitate novice programmers in learning the basic programming concepts. Visual programming environments which support the construction of programs through a drag-and-drop interface are among the most popular coding tools for teaching novice programmers. In this paper, we investigate the use of Alice and App Inventor for Android, with regard to their effectiveness for teaching and learning programming in secondary education\nstudents.","authors":["Stamatios J Papadakis","Vasileios Orfanakis"],"meta":["January 2018International Journal of Technology Enhanced Learning 10(1/2):44","DOI:10.1504/IJTEL.2018.088333","Project: Teaching programming in novices"],"references":["320638122_Teaching_an_Introductory_Programming_Language_in_a_General_Education_Course","315137160_Mobile_educational_applications_for_children_What_educators_and_parents_need_to_know","315066728_The_Combined_Use_of_Lego_Mindstorms_NXT_and_App_Inventor_for_Teaching_Novice_Programmers","313849509_Using_Scratch_and_App_Inventor_for_teaching_introductory_programming_in_secondary_education_A_case_study","313087810_Designing_and_creating_an_educational_app_rubric_for_preschool_teachers","311463730_WIPE_a_programming_environment_for_novices","310744349_Creativity_and_innovation_in_European_education_10_years_eTwinning_Past_present_and_the_future","308200082_More_Playful_User_Interfaces_Interfaces_that_Invite_Social_and_Physical_Interaction","305390965_Developing_fundamental_programming_concepts_and_computational_thinking_with_ScratchJr_in_preschool_education_A_case_study","298972479_Learning_Computer_Science_Concepts_with_Scratch"]}
