{"id":"331703498_Deoxyribonucleic_Acid_Computing_Used_To_Solve_Path_Problems_with_Conditions","abstract":"Deoxyribonucleic Acid Computing (DNA) is a new computing technique. In this technique, the information is stored in DNA molecules and computational tools are available in the form of biochemistry operations. In computer science, different models of DNA computing are available, in which some are equivalent to a classic Turing Machine. The researchers worked on improving error rates in this technique. Limited work has been found that the researchers also tried to solve real-life applications by using this technique and tried to find the practical feasibility of DNA computers, (For example to break Data Encryption Standard (DES), to solve NP-complete and hard computational problems). In this study, different techniques have been studies for solving Path Problems using DNA computing and found the best technique by comparison. Also devised a new technique to solve the given path problems","authors":["Muhammd Mehboob","Malik Sikander Hayat Khiyal","Dr. Sanam Shahla Rizvi","Rabia Riaz"],"meta":["March 2019Journal of Engineering and Applied Sciences 14(7):2208-2211","DOI:10.36478/jeasci.2019.2208.2211"],"references":[]}
