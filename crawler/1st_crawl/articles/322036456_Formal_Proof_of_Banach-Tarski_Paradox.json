{"id":"322036456_Formal_Proof_of_Banach-Tarski_Paradox","abstract":"Banach-Tarski Paradox states that a ball in 3D space is equidecomposable with twice itself, i.e. we can break a ball into a finite number of pieces, and with these pieces, build two balls having the same size as the initial ball. This strange result is actually a Theorem which was proven in 1924 by Stefan Banach and Alfred Tarski using the Axiom of Choice. We present here a formal proof in Coq of this theorem.","authors":["Daniel de Rauglaudre"],"meta":["October 2017Journal of Formalized Reasoning 10(1):37-49","DOI:10.6092/issn.1972-5787/6927"],"references":["319395426_The_Axiom_of_Choice","239724138_Axiom_of_Choice_and_Complementation"]}
