{"id":"340384333_Towards_learning_analytics_adoption_A_mixed_methods_study_of_data-related_practices_and_policies_in_Latin_American_universities_Data_practices_and_policies_in_Latin_America","abstract":"In Latin American universities, Learning Analytics (LA) has been perceived as a promising opportunity to leverage data to meet the needs of a diverse student cohort. Although universities have been collecting educational data for years, the adoption of LA in this region is still limited due to the lack of expertise and policies for processing and using educational data. In order to get a better picture of how existing data‐related practices and policies might affect the incorporation of LA in Latin American institutions, we conducted a mixed methods study in four Latin American universities (two Chilean and two Ecuadorian). In this paper, the qualitative data were based on 37 interviews with managers and 16 focus groups with 51 teaching staff and 45 students; the quantitative data were collected through two surveys answered by 1884 students and 368 teachers, respectively. The findings reveal opportunities to incorporate LA services into existing data practices in the four case studies. However, the lack of reliable information systems and policies to regulate the use of data imposes challenges that need to be overcome for future LA adoption.","authors":["Isabel Hilliger","Margarita Ortiz","Paola Pesántez-Cabrera","Eliana Scheihing"],"meta":["April 2020British Journal of Educational Technology 51(2)","DOI:10.1111/bjet.12933"],"references":["335699105_Policy_Matters_Expert_Recommendations_for_Learning_Analytics_Policy","335579135_Students'_Perceptions_about_Learning_Analytics_in_a_Brazilian_Higher_Education_Institution","334576727_Datos_personales_marketing_digital_y_los_derechos_de_los_ciudadanos_de_America_Latina","333846924_The_Student_Expectations_of_Learning_Analytics_Questionnaire","325127346_The_LALA_Project_Building_Capacity_to_Use_Learning_Analytics_to_Improve_Higher_Education_in_Latin_America","346928467_At_a_Crossroads_Higher_Education_in_Latin_America_and_the_Caribbean","335570727_Intelligent_Analysis_and_Data_Visualisation_for_Teacher_Assistance_tools_the_case_of_exploratory_learning","321692439_Guiding_Early_and_Often_Using_Curricular_and_Learning_Analytics_to_Shape_Teaching_Learning_and_Student_Success_in_Gateway_Courses_Guiding_Early_and_Often","321413709_Quality_assurance_in_Latin_America_current_situation_and_future_challenges","321413223_An_initial_review_of_learning_analytics_in_Latin_America"]}
