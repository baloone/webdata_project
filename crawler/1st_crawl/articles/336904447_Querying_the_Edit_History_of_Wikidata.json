{"id":"336904447_Querying_the_Edit_History_of_Wikidata","abstract":"In its 7 years of existence, Wikidata has accumulated an edit history of millions of contributions. In this paper, we propose a system that makes this data accessible through a SPARQL endpoint. We index not just the diffs done by a revision, but also the global state of Wikidata graph after any given revision. This allows users to answer complex SPARQL 1.1 queries on the Wikidata history, tracing the contributions of human vs. automated contributors, the areas of vandalism, the big schema changes, or the adoption of different values for the “gender” property across time.","authors":["Thomas Pellissier Tanon","Fabian Suchanek"],"meta":["October 2019","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-32327-1_32","In book: The Semantic Web: ESWC 2019 Satellite Events (pp.161-166)"],"references":["325529618_HDTQ_Managing_RDF_Datasets_in_Compressed_Space","220538435_x-RDF3X_Fast_querying_high_update_rates_and_consistency_for_RDF_databases","333072352_Learning_How_to_Correct_a_Knowledge_Base_from_the_Edit_History","327089734_Evaluating_query_and_storage_strategies_for_RDF_archives","324645979_OSTRICH_Versioned_Random-Access_Triple_Store","312721515_Introducing_Wikidata_to_the_Linked_Data_Web","311756837_Self-Indexing_RDF_Archives","309020220_Evaluating_Query_and_Storage_Strategies_for_RDF_Archives","282271599_Towards_efficient_archiving_of_dynamic_linked_open_data","280081029_Wikidata_A_Free_Collaborative_Knowledgebase","265140763_RWbase_git_for_triples","221022123_Scaling_RDF_with_time","220575516_OWLIM_A_family_of_scalable_semantic_repositories"]}
