{"id":"238495459_Piaget's_Constructivism_Papert's_Constructionism_What's_the_difference","abstract":"What is the difference between Piaget's constructivism and Papert's \"constructionism\"? Beyond the mere play on the words, I think the distinction holds, and that integrating both views can enrich our understanding of how people learn and grow. Piaget's constructivism offers a window into what children are interested in, and able to achieve, at different stages of their development. The theory describes how children's ways of doing and thinking evolve over time, and under which circumstance children are more likely to let go of—or hold onto— their currently held views. Piaget suggests that children have very good reasons not to abandon their worldviews just because someone else, be it an expert, tells them they're wrong. Papert's constructionism, in contrast, focuses more on the art of learning, or 'learning to learn', and on the significance of making things in learning. Papert is interested in how learners engage in a conversation with (their own or other people's) artifacts, and how these conversations boost self-directed learning, and ultimately facilitate the construction of new knowledge. He stresses the importance of tools, media, and context in human development. Integrating both perspectives illuminates the processes by which individuals come to make sense of their experience, gradually optimizing their interactions with the world","authors":["Edith Ackermann"],"meta":["January 2001"],"references":["284833733_Cognitive_development_The_descriptive_problem","239640722_Conceptual_Change_in_Childhood","232530691_Everyday_Cognition_Its_Development_in_Social_Context","228328529_Mindstorms_Children_Computers_and_Powerful_Ideas","224927712_The_Second_Self_Computers_and_the_Human_Spirit","49176543_Situated_Cognition_and_Culture_of_Learning","16185924_Cognitive_styles_essence_and_origins_Field_dependence_and_field_independence"]}
