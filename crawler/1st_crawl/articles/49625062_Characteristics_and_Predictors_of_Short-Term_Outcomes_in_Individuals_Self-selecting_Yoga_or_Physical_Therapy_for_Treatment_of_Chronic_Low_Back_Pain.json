{"id":"49625062_Characteristics_and_Predictors_of_Short-Term_Outcomes_in_Individuals_Self-selecting_Yoga_or_Physical_Therapy_for_Treatment_of_Chronic_Low_Back_Pain","abstract":"To compare clinical and demographic characteristics of individuals self-selecting yoga or physical therapy (PT) for treatment of chronic low back pain (cLBP) and to examine predictors of short-term pain and functional outcomes.\nDescriptive, longitudinal study.\nA hospital-based clinic that offers modified integral yoga classes for cLBP and 2 outpatient PT clinics that offer exercise-based PT.\nAdults (n=53) with cLBP≥12 weeks: yoga (n=27), PT (n=26).\nYoga participants attended a 6-week, once weekly, 2-hour yoga class. PT participants underwent twice weekly, 1-hour individualized PT. Data were collected at baseline and at 6 weeks. Groups were compared by using χ2 and independent samples t-tests. Hierarchical linear regression was used to predict treatment outcomes.\nDisability (Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire), health status (Rand Short Form 36 Health Survey 1.0), pain bothersomeness (numerical rating scale), back pain self-efficacy (Back Pain Self-Efficacy Scale), and treatment satisfaction.\nAt baseline, yoga participants were significantly less disabled (P=.013), had higher health status (P=.023), greater pain self-efficacy (P=.012), and less average pain bothersomeness (P=.001) compared with PT participants. At 6 weeks, when controlling for baseline group differences, greater pain self-efficacy was the strongest predictor for reduced pain and higher function for the entire sample. A significant group interaction by baseline pain self-efficacy predicted disability at 6 weeks. PT participants with low pain self-efficacy reported significantly greater disability than those with high pain self-efficacy. Yoga participants with low and high pain self-efficacy had similar disability outcomes.\nThese findings strengthen evidence that self-efficacy is associated with cLBP outcomes, especially in individuals self-selecting PT. Further research to evaluate outcomes after yoga and PT in participants with low pain self-efficacy is needed.","authors":["Dian Evans","Michael Allen Carter","Richard Panico","Laura
