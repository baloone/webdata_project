{"id":"284866579_Balanced_scorecards_in_managing_higher_education_institutions_An_Indian_perspective","abstract":"Purpose - The paper aims to look at the balanced scorecard (BSC) concept and discuss in what way it should be applied to higher education programs/institutions in the Indian context. Design/methodology/approach - The paper is based on extant literature on the balanced scorecard concept per se, as well as applications of BSC in higher education as reported by other researchers. Findings - The BSC approach offers an institution the opportunity to formulate a cascade of measures to translate the mission of knowledge creation, sharing and utilization into a comprehensive, coherent, communicable and mobilizing framework - for external stakeholders and for one another. Research limitations/implications - In the absence of any specific Indian case study, the possible impact could only be conjectured or deduced. Practical implications - A useful model is proposed that can be adapted with appropriate modifications to the management of tertiary institutions of education in India, whether it be a university, affiliate college, autonomous institution or private educational institution. Originality/value - In the absence of evidence of the application of BSC to the educational institutional domain in India, the current paper may be a starting-point for a debate and possible strategies to implement BSC methodology in this area.","authors":["Umashankar Venkatesh","Kirti Dutta"],"meta":["January 2007International Journal of Educational Management 21(1):54-67","DOI:10.1108/09513540710716821"],"references":["291365930_Teaching_vs_research_in_Indian_universities_5","242023527_Higher_education_institution_image_A_correspondence_analysis_approach","228372613_Balanced_Scorecard_Myth_and_Reality","228146915_The_Importance_of_Managing_Points-of-Marketing_in_Marketing_Higher_Education_Programmes_-_Some_Conclusions","31773258_Pursuing_Excellence_in_Higher_Education_Eight_Fundamental_Challenges_BD_Ruben_prol_de_David_Ward","347561985_Private_Higher_Education_A_Global_Revolution","298043780_The_Balanced_Scorecard_measures_that_drive_performance","294354010_Patterns_and_priorities_in_Indian_research_and_development","285786481_How_strategy_maps_frame_an_organization's_objectives","281085900_Transforming_the_Balanced_Scorecard_From_Performance_Measurement_to_Strategic_Management_Part_II","248150081_Transforming_The_Balanced_Scorecard_from_Performance_Measurement_to_Strategic_Management_Part_II","247874506_The_Balanced_ScorecardA_Potential_Tool_for_Supporting_Change_and_Continuous_Improvement_in_Accounting_Education","247507663_A_comparative_study_of_quality_practices_in_higher_education_institutions_in_US_and_Malaysia","243697887_Putting_the_Balanced_Scorecard_to_Work","241981450_Strategic_Learning_the_Balanced_Scorecard","241747282_Graphical_Representation_of_University_Image_A_Correspondence_AnalysisJournal_of_Marketing_for_Higher_Education","238737121_Applying_the_Balanced_Scorecard_to_Education","235360723_Using_the_Balanced_Scorecard_as_a_Strategic_Management_System","235274128_Scorecard_for_academic_administration_performance_on_the_campus","234704779_Bibliography_on_Higher_Education_in_India","225930367_The_Impact_of_Massification_on_University_Research","225083609_Quality_in_higher_education_From_monitoring_to_management","44826571_Is_Higher_Education_Ready_for_Knowledge_Management","30525829_Manpower_needs_and_the_planning_of_higher_education"]}
