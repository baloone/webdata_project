{"id":"341992828_Data_Mining_Predicting_of_Student_Performance_Using_Classification_Technique","abstract":"Abstract\nThis paper is aims to analyses and evaluates student performance in the Department of Computer Science,\nJigawa State Polytechnic. The data were collected for two (2) years intake from July 2016 to June 2018 it\ncontains student previous academic records Such as course code, course Name marks obtained for each student\nby applying the classification technique algorism in Rapid Miner tool. Data mining provides good and powerful\nmethods for education and another different field of study. Due to the vast amount of data of student which is used\nto find out valuable information which can be used to determine the student success. In this paper a classification\ntask was used for the prediction. A decision tree model is applied during the experiment. The results indicates that\nit is possible to predicts the graduation performance, in addition, a procedure for evaluating the performance for\neach course have identified.","authors":["Sani Salisu","Babandi Usaman"],"meta":["June 2020","Project: Mobile Computing: Devices, Application and Concept"],"references":["337002500_PerformanceVis_Visual_analytics_of_student_performance_data_from_an_introductory_chemistry_course","336540246_S_PRAR_A_novel_relational_association_rule_mining_classification_model_applied_for_academic_performance_prediction","335784471_Data-driven_tool_for_monitoring_of_students_performance","334778644_Hybrid_Rule-Based_Model_for_Phishing_URLs_Detection","331539311_Recovering_Data_Using_MFT_Records_in_NTFS_File_System","325437832_Collecting_sexual_assault_history_and_forensic_evidence_from_adult_women_in_the_emergency_department_A_retrospective_study","335497083_An_overview_and_comparison_of_supervised_data_mining_techniques_for_student_exam_performance_prediction","326726686_Predicting_academic_performance_by_considering_student_heterogeneity","324750945_Study_on_student_performance_estimation_student_progress_analysis_and_student_potential_prediction_based_on_data_mining","323221701_Centralized_student_performance_prediction_in_large_courses_based_on_low-cost_variables_in_an_institutional_context"]}
