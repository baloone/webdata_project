{"id":"274505291_Numerical_analysis_of_axisymmetric_turbulent_swirling_flow_in_circular_pipe","abstract":"In this paper, turbulent swirling flow in circular pipe is numerically investigated using OpenFOAM, an open-source computational fluid dynamics software. Flow is computed as 2-D axisymmetric, with various turbulent models, but with main accent on computations with Reynolds stress transport models. Two Reynolds stress models were used in computations: Launder-Gibson and Speziale-Sarkar-Gatski models. Previous author's experimental results are used as a validation tool for numerical computations. It was shown that standard two-equation models can not predict the flow in right manner, while the Reynolds stress models give good prediction of mean velocities. As apart of research Speziale-Sarkar-Gatski model is implemented in OpenFOAM code.","authors":["Aleksandar S. Cocic","Milan R. Lecic","Svetislav M.
