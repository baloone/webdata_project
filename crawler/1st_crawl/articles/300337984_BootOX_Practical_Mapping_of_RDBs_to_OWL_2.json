{"id":"300337984_BootOX_Practical_Mapping_of_RDBs_to_OWL_2","abstract":"Ontologies have recently became a popular mechanism to expose relational database (RDBs) due to their ability to describe the domain of data in terms of classes and properties that are clear to domain experts. Ontological terms are related to the schema of the underlying databases with the help of mappings, i.e., declarative specifications associating SQL queries to ontological terms. Developing appropriate ontologies and mappings for given RDBs is a challenging and time consuming task. In this work we present BootOX, a system that aims at facilitating ontology and mapping development by their automatic extraction (i.e., bootstrapping) from RDBs, and our experience with the use of BootOX in industrial and research contexts. BootOX has a number of advantages: it allows to control the OWL 2 profile of the output ontologies, bootstrap complex and provenance mappings, which are beyond the W3C direct mapping specification. Moreover, BootOX allows to import pre-existing ontologies via alignment.","authors":["Ernesto Jim√©nez-Ruiz","Evgeny Kharlamov","Dmitriy Zheleznyakov","Ian Horrocks"],"meta":["October 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-25010-6_7","Conference: ISWC"],"references":["301953009_Detecting_and_Correcting_Conservativity_Principle_Violations_in_Ontology-to-Ontology_Mappings","300895621_RODI_A_Benchmark_for_Automatic_Mapping_Generation_in_Relational-to-Ontology_Data_Integration","300337985_Ontology_Based_Access_to_Exploration_Data_at_Statoil","289824234_Effective_Computation_of_Maximal_Sound_Approximations_of_Description_Logic_Ontologies","288497111_Mastro_studio","326907914_Efficient_SPARQL-to-SQL_with_R2RML_Mappings","326337868_Ultrawrap_SPARQL_Execution_on_Relational_Data","312721366_How_Semantic_Technologies_Can_Enhance_Data_Access_at_Siemens_Energy","289873518_Faceted_Search_over_Ontology-Enhanced_RDF_Data","289207280_Enabling_faceted_search_over_OWL_2_with_SemFacet"]}
