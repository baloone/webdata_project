{"id":"326201483_Novel_Algorithms_for_Abstract_Dialectical_Frameworks_based_on_Complexity_Analysis_of_Subclasses_and_SAT_Solving","abstract":"dialectical frameworks (ADFs) constitute one of the most powerful formalisms in abstract argumentation. Their high computational complexity poses, however, certain challenges when designing efficient systems. In this paper, we tackle this issue by (i) analyzing the complexity of ADFs under structural restrictions, (ii) presenting novel algorithms which make use of these insights, and (iii) empirically evaluating a resulting implementation which relies on calls to SAT solvers.","authors":["Thomas Linsbichler","Marco Maratea","Andreas Niskanen","Johannes Peter Wallner"],"meta":["July 2018","DOI:10.24963/ijcai.2018/263","Conference: Twenty-Seventh International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence {IJCAI-18}"],"references":[]}
