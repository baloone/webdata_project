{"id":"266619383_Sampling_and_Galerkin_reconstruction_in_reproducing_kernel_spaces","abstract":"In this paper, we consider sampling in a reproducing kernel subspace of\n$L^p$. We introduce a pre-reconstruction operator associated with a sampling\nscheme and propose a Galerkin reconstruction in general Banach space setting.\nWe show that the proposed Galerkin method provides a quasi-optimal\napproximation, and the corresponding Galerkin equations could be solved by an\niterative approximation-projection algorithm. We also present detailed analysis\nand numerical simulations of the Galerkin method for reconstructing signals\nwith finite rate of innovation.","authors":["Cheng Cheng","Yingchun Jiang","Qiyu Sun"],"meta":["October 2014Applied and Computational Harmonic Analysis 41(2)","DOI:10.1016/j.acha.2015.12.007","SourcearXiv","Project: sampling theory"],"references":["263699550_Approximation_of_almost_time_and_band_limited_functions_I_Hermite_expansions","259633349_Rate_of_Innovation_for_Non-Periodic_Signals_and_Optimal_Lower_Stability_Bound_for_Filtering","257315073_Sampling_in_Reproducing_Kernel_Banach_Spaces","244476956_Sampling_Expansions_in_Reproducing_Kernel_Hilbert_and_Banach_Spaces","243765604_Iterative_Reconstruction_of_Multivariate_Band-Limited_Functions_from_Irregular_Sampling_Values","238282902_Non-uniform_sampling_and_reconstruction_in_shift-invariant_spaces","228649353_Exact_iterative_reconstruction_algorithm_for_multivariate_irregularly_sampled_functions_in_spline-like_spaces_The_L_p-theory","228645404_General_framework_for_consistent_sampling_in_Hilbert_spaces","226378872_Convolution_Average_Sampling_and_a_Calderon_Resolution_of_the_Identity_for_Shift-Invariant_Spaces","225693010_Efficient_numerical_methods_in_non-uniform_sampling_theory","225266134_The_band_method_for_positive_and_strictly_contractive_extension_problems_An_alternative_version_and_new_applications","224327960_Nonlinear_and_Nonideal_Sampling_Theory_and_Methods","45888097_Approximate_reconstruction_of_bandlimited_functions_for_the_integrate_and_fire_sampler","3450825_Perfect_Recovery_and_Sensitivity_Analysis_of_Time_Encoded_Bandlimited_Signals","344896354_Oblique_projections_biorthogonal_Riesz_bases_and_multiwavelets_in_Hilbert_spaces","303338647_Reconstruction_algorithms_in_irregular_sampling","296607953_Duration_and_Bandwidth_Limiting_Prolate_Functions_Sampling_and_Applications","285787785_Wiener's_theorem_and_asymptotic_estimates_for_elements_of_inverse_matrices","268493144_Interpolatory_Function_Theory","265988893_An_algebra_of_pseudodifferential_operators","265352945_Wiener's_theorem_and_the_asymptotic_estimates_of_the_elements_of_inverse_matrices","262981434_Sampling_Curves_With_Finite_Rate_of_Innovation","262980170_Weighted_frames_of_exponentials_and_stable_recovery_of_multidimensional_functions_from_nonuniform_Fourier_samples","260637752_Xampling_Signal_Acquisition_and_Processing_in_Union_of_Subspaces","259211449_Sampling_and_Reconstruction_in_Different_Subspaces_by_Using_Oblique_Projections","258113881_On_Stable_Reconstructions_from_Nonuniform_Fourier_Measurements","243080786_Wiener's_lemma_for_infinite_matrices","242922721_Reconstruction_Algorithms_in_Irregular_Sampling","242144031_Nonuniform_Sampling_and_Reconstruction_in_Shift-Invariant_Spaces","241570205_Oblique_projections_biorthogonal_riesz_bases_and_multiwavelets_in_hilbert_spaces","236136873_Localized_nonlinear_functional_equations_and_two_sampling_problems_in_signal_processing","234113920_Beyond_Consistent_Reconstructions_Optimality_and_Sharp_Bounds_for_Generalized_Sampling_and_Application_to_the_Uniform_Resampling_Problem","232243118_Wiener_type_algebras_of_pseudodifferential_operators","227307154_Wiener's_Lemma_for_Infinite_Matrices_II","226872113_Nonuniform_Average_Sampling_and_Reconstruction_in_Multiply_Generated_Shift-Invariant_Spaces","226797265_General_sampling_theorems_for_functions_in_reproducing_kernel_Hilbert_spaces","226081950_Wiener's_Lemma_Theme_and_Variations_An_Introduction_to_Spectral_Invariance_and_Its_Applications","224514523_Communication_in_the_Presence_of_Noise","224381249_Bovik_AC_Mean_squared_error_love_it_or_leave_it_-_A_new_look_at_signal_fidelity_measures_IEEE_Sig_Process_Mag_26_98-117","222828513_Sampling_and_reconstruction_of_signals_in_a_reproducing_kernel_subspace_of_L-PR-d","220390859_Frames_in_spaces_with_finite_rate_of_innovation","220132364_Nonuniform_Average_Sampling_and_Reconstruction_of_Signals_with_Finite_Rate_of_Innovation","200524212_The_finite_section_method_and_problems_in_frame_theory","51931085_Sampling_based_on_timing_Time_encoding_machines_on_shift-invariant_subspaces","45932966_Sampling_in_reproducing_kernel_Banach_spaces_on_Lie_groups","45894325_Wiener's_Lemma_for_Infinite_Matrices_II","37446486_Sampling_Moments_and_Reconstructing_Signals_of_Finite_Rate_of_Innovation_Shannon_Meets_Strang-Fix","3470211_Communication_In_The_Presence_Of_Noise","3318328_Sampling_Signals_With_Finite_Rate_of_Innovation","3080832_Reconstruction_of_band-limited_signals_from_local_averages","2985684_Sampling-50_years_after_Shannon"]}
