{"id":"322079674_Analyzing_the_Social_Networks_of_High-_and_Low-Performing_Students_in_Online_Discussion_Forums","abstract":"An ego network is an individual’s social netwrk relationships with core members. In this study, the ego network parameters in online discussion spaces of high- and low-performing students were compared. The extent to which students’ ego networks changed over the course were also analyzed. Participation in 7 weeks of online discussions were analyzed for 12 high-performing students and 9 low-performing students. Results suggested that ego networks’ compositions of high- and low-performing students were significantly different. Particularly, high-performing students had denser ego networks and tended to exhibit a higher level of centralities than low-performing students. Results of network visualization indicated that high-performing students increased and kept their networks stable over the course in comparison to low-performing students, who had fragmented networks. Several networks’ change mechanisms for high- and low-performing groups are also identified and discussed.","authors":["Hajar Ghadirian","Keyvan Salehi","Ahmad fauzi Mohd Ayub"],"meta":["December 2017American Journal of Distance Education 32(3):1-16","DOI:10.1080/08923647.2018.1412570"],"references":["284379318_Classification_via_clustering_for_predicting_final_marks_based_on_student_participation_in_forums","267420807_Social_Activity_and_Structural_Centrality_in_Online_Social_Networks","323424582_Statistical_power_analysis_for_the_behavioral_sciences","303420124_Social_network_analysis_and_practice","291087725_In_good_company","284544228_Collaborative_Learning_of_Students_in_Online_Discussion_Forums_A_Social_Network_Analysis_Perspective","273354153_The_Spread_of_Obesity_in_a_Large_Social_Network_Over_32_Years","272239937_Participation_Interaction_and_Academic_Achievement_in_an_Online_Discussion_Environment","268741354_Applying_social_learning_analytics_to_message_boards_in_online_distance_learning_A_case_study","262166882_Visualizing_the_Affective_Structure_of_Students_Interaction"]}
