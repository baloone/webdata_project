{"id":"303028716_A_Proposal_for_an_Antifragile_Software_Manifesto","abstract":"The disruptive nature of the antifragile approach for open and complex systems is of greatest importance and needs to be systematized, especially for software systems. In fact, antifragile software design is becoming a research issue in the software engineering community. We got inspired by the Agile Manifesto which set an important reference point to the software community, addressing primarily innovation in the software development process.","authors":["Daniel Russo","Paolo Ciancarini"],"meta":["December 2016Procedia Computer Science 83:982-987","DOI:10.1016/j.procs.2016.04.196"],"references":["295944089_Benefits_of_Open_Source_Software_in_Defense_Environments","274320113_On_Resilient_Behaviors_in_Computational_Systems_and_Environments","273825811_Engineering_Antifragile_Systems_A_Change_In_Design_Philosophy","271855775_Software_that_Learns_from_its_Own_Failures","259804615_Antifragility_Elasticity_Resilience_Machine_Learning_Models_and_Algorithms_for_Open_System_Fidelity","261597855_Principles_of_Antifragile_Software","46763446_The_Black_Swan_The_Impact_of_the_Highly_Improbable","3189367_Redundancy_in_Data_Structures_Improving_Software_Fault_Tolerance"]}
