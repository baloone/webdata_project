{"id":"304031889_A_splitting_algorithm_for_a_class_of_bilevel_equilibrium_problems_involving_nonexpansive_mappings","abstract":"We propose splitting, parallel algorithms for solving strongly equilibrium problems over the intersection of a finite number of closed convex sets given as the fixed-point sets of nonexpansive mappings in real Hilbert spaces. The algorithm is a combination between the gradient method and the Mann-Krasnoselâ€™skii iterative scheme, where the projection can be computed onto each set separately rather than onto their intersection. Strong convergence is proved. Some special cases involving bilevel equilibrium problems with inverse strongly monotone variational inequality, monotone equilibrium constraints and maximal monotone inclusions are discussed. An illustrative example involving a system of integral equations is presented.","authors":["Duc Phung Minh","Le Dung Muu"],"meta":["June 2016Optimization","DOI:10.1080/02331934.2016.1195831"],"references":["260346271_Research_Article_An_Implicit_Iteration_Method_for_Variational_Inequalities_over_the_Set_of_Common_Fixed_Points_for_a_Finite_Family_of_Nonexpansive_Mappings_in_Hilbert_Spaces","259640551_On_extragradient-viscosity_methods_for_solving_equilibrium_and_fixed_point_problems_in_a_Hilbert_space","258238589_A_Direct_Splitting_Method_for_Nonsmooth_Variational_Inequalities","235617879_On_the_convergence_of_splitting_proximal_methods_for_equilibrium_Problems_in_Hilbertspaces","231860706_Iterative_Algorithms_for_Nonlinear_Operators","228379876_An_inexact_subgradient_algorithm_for_Equilibrium_Problems","226934678_Regularization_Algorithms_for_Solving_Monotone_Ky_Fan_Inequalities_with_Application_to_a_Nash-Cournot_Equilibrium_Model","220259427_General_Projective_Splitting_Methods_for_Sums_of_Maximal_Monotone_Operators","220249173_Extragradient_algorithms_extended_to_equilibrium_problems","315573860_Convex_Analysis_and_Monotone_Operator_Theory_in_Hilbert_Spaces","274855381_A_new_explicit_iterative_algorithm_for_solving_a_class_of_variational_inequalities_over_the_common_fixed_points_set_of_a_finite_family_of_nonexpansive_mappings","266047347_Foundations_of_Bi-Level_Programming","265457380_Regularization_method_for_nonmonotone_equilibrium_problems","256760634_Projective_splitting_methods_for_sums_of_maximal_monotone_operators_with_applications","244959245_A_modified_forward-backward_splitting_method_for_maximal_monotone_mapping","244470228_Minimizing_certain_convex_functions_over_the_intersection_of_the_fixed_point_sets_of_nonexpansive_mappings","243092619_Monotone_Operators_and_the_Proximal_Point_Algorithm","243042067_Iterative_Algorithms_for_Equilibrium_Problems","241094003_The_Tikhonov_Regularization_Extended_to_Equilibrium_Problems_Involving_Pseudomonotone_Bifunctions","233807537_Existence_and_solution_methods_for_equilibria","228638449_Equilibrium_programming_in_Hilbert_spaces","225843561_Using_the_Banach_Contraction_Principle_to_Implement_the_Proximal_Point_Method_for_Multivalued_Monotone_Variational_Inequalities","220531314_An_Explicit_Iterative_Algorithm_for_a_Class_of_Variational_Inequalities_in_Hilbert_Spaces","215618140_Mathematical_Programs_with_Equilibrium_Constraints","2691407_Co-Coercivity_And_Its_Role_In_The_Convergence_Of_Iterative_Schemes_For_Solving_Variational_Inequalities","2611152_A_Modified_Forward-Backward_Splitting_Method_For_Maximal_Monotone_Mappings"]}
