{"id":"266201822_Natural_Language_Processing_Almost_from_Scratch","abstract":"We propose a unified neural network architecture and learning algorithm that\ncan be applied to various natural language processing tasks including:\npart-of-speech tagging, chunking, named entity recognition, and semantic role\nlabeling. This versatility is achieved by trying to avoid task-specific\nengineering and therefore disregarding a lot of prior knowledge. Instead of\nexploiting man-made input features carefully optimized for each task, our\nsystem learns internal representations on the basis of vast amounts of mostly\nunlabeled training data. This work is then used as a basis for building a\nfreely available tagging system with good performance and minimal computational\nrequirements.","authors":["Ronan Collobert","Jason Weston","Leon Bottou","Michael Karlen"],"meta":["February 2011Journal of Machine Learning Research 12(12):2493-2537"],"references":["303137904_Greedy_layer-wise_training_of_deep_networks","269087977_Modeling_latent-dynamic_in_shallow_parsing","262408350_Effective_self-training_for_parsing","289827888_Distributional_Part-of-Speech_Tagging","288905957_SVMTool_A_general_POS_tagger_generator_based_on_support_vector_machines","284761081_A_learning_scheme_for_asymmetric_threshold_networks","284266320_Bayesian_Learning_for_Neural_Networks_Lecture_Notes_in_Statistical_Vol_118","277299370_Large_Scale_Machine_Learning","262406121_Dynamic_Conditional_Random_Fields_Factorized_Probabilistic_Models_for_Labeling_and_Segmenting_Sequence_Data","250754760_25_Continuous_speech_recognition_Statistical_methods"]}
