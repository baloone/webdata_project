{"id":"304748239_Analysis_of_a_Full_Space-Time_Discretization_of_the_Navier-Stokes_Equations_by_a_Local_Projection_Stabilization_Method","abstract":"A finite element error analysis of a local projection stabilization (LPS) method for the time-dependent Navier-Stokes equations is presented. The focus is on the high-order term-by-term stabilization method that has one level, in the sense that it is defined on a single mesh, and in which the projection-stabilized structure of standard LPS methods is replaced by an interpolation-stabilized structure. The main contribution is on proving, theoretically and numerically, the optimal convergence order of the arising fully discrete scheme. In addition, the asymptotic energy balance is obtained for slightly smooth flows. Numerical studies support the analytical results and illustrate the potential of the method for the simulation of turbulent flows. Smooth unsteady flows are simulated with optimal order of accuracy.","authors":["Naveed Ahmed","Tomás Chacón Rebollo","Volker John","Samuele Rubino"],"meta":["September 2016IMA Journal of Numerical
