{"id":"347909609_Assurance_Driven_Software_Design_using_Assurance_Case_Based_Approach","abstract":"Software design for dependable and critical systems is very complex. There are lot of regulations and guidelines for developing of software for such systems. These guidelines mostly demands practical evidence or documentary proof to have a justified confidence that the system shall meet its all critical requirements. To achieve this primary aim, assurance cases can be very helpful. A well-structured Assurance Case facilitates developers to state goals and sub-goals of the system and to determine the required artifacts which can be used as an evidence to prove that system is operating as per requirements. With this, one can also check if a complete set of evidences satisfies the stated requirements. Goal Structuring Notations (GSN) or Claims-Arguments-Evidence (CAE) allows graphical presentation of an Assurance Case. Graphics notations facilitate easy to present and understand assurance cases. The present paper has provided an overview of Assurance Case along with its structure and illustration taking example of Assurance Case for Door Access Control Software for better understanding. The paper has also briefly covered the details of the relevant projects carried out globally, using Assurance Cases.","authors":["Dipak Gade","Santosh Deshpande"],"meta":["October 2007"],"references":["347909601_A_Literature_Review_on_Assurance_Driven_Software_Design","271099929_Software_Assurance_Using_Structured_Assurance_Case_Models","221431021_Assurance_Cases_in_Model-Driven_Development_of_the_Pacemaker_Software","4371243_Using_an_Assurance_Case_to_Support_Independent_Assessment_of_the_Transition_to_a_New_GPS_Ground_Control_System","4261637_Assurance_Based_Development_of_Critical_Systems"]}
