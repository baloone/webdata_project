{"id":"316472117_Mobile_Application_Development_for_Improving_Auditory_Memory_Skills_of_Children_with_Hearing_Impairment","abstract":"Purpose: As technological progress of the smartphones has been accelerating, the needs of applications (apps) for children with hearing impairment (HI) have been also increasing now in auditory habilitationists and their parents. This study introduces the process of developing the mobile apps for improving auditory memory skills of children with HI. Methods: The contents of the apps were developed based the professional knowledge and clinical experiences by the auditory habilitationists. The design model for developing the apps was proposed by the experts of the auditory habilitation and computer sciences. The usability testing was conducted to improve the appsâ€™ functions. Results: Six mobile apps were developed through the app-development process including planning, design, and programming. The results of the usability test showed that the apps were suitable and efficient to improve auditory memory skills for children with HI. Conclusion: The mobile apps developed in this study could be useful for improving auditory skills of children with HI in the clinical and home-based setting. This paper provides the process, knowledge, and experiences on developing the mobile app for auditory habilitation of children with HI.","authors":["Youngmee Lee"],"meta":["January 2017"],"references":["326601243_Case_Study_of_Speech_Perception_Enhancement_in_Hearing-Impaired_Adult_by_Auditory_Training_Program_of_Mobile_Device","310472815_Parental_Current_Practice_and_Needs_in_Smart_Device_Applications_for_Children_with_Cochlear_Implants","309468486_Analysis_on_Current_Practice_and_Needs_based_Survey_of_Parents_and_Speech-Language_Pathologists_for_Reading_Intervention_with_Smart_Device_Applications","283851928_Analysis_of_Mobile_Application_Trends_for_Speech_and_Language_Therapy_of_Children_with_Disabilities_in_Korea","334393868_Auditory_Sequential_Organization_Ability_Among_Children_and_Adults_With_Normal_Hearing","324199683_The_Effects_of_Parental_Education_Using_an_Utterance-Analyzing_Application_on_Initiation_Response_and_Turn-Taking_in_Conversations_Between_Children_With_ASD_and_Their_Parents","315982259_A_Practical_Use_of_Touch_Interface_Design_for_Educational_Applications_-_Focus_on_Smart_Phone_Apps_for_Children_-","306022700_Developing_a_Mobile_Application_to_Learn_Korean_for_Children_with_Hearing_Impairment_-_Human-centered_Design_Approach_-","284940687_Analysis_of_character_preference_according_to_expression_motive_in_the_educational_applications_for_children_-_Focusing_on_children_aged_3_to_6_learning_by_using_a_smart_phone_-","270547993_Speech-Language_Therapy_Using_Apps_for_a_Student_with_Cerebral_Palsy"]}
