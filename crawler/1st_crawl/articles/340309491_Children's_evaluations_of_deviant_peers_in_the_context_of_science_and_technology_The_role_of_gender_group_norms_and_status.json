Less is known about how children evaluate their peers who challenge gendered expectations of who can and should take part in computer science. The present study asked children (n = 213; female n = 110) from middle (Mage = 8.71, n = 108) and late childhood (Mage = 10.56, n = 105) to evaluate a gender-matched peer who challenged a group norm related to either computer science (male-gendered domain) or biology (less male-gendered domain). Male participants most negatively evaluated a peer who wanted to take part in a biology activity when the rest of the group wanted to do a programming activity. Further, male participants expected their group to negatively evaluate this deviant peer in the programming condition. Mediation analysis revealed that for boys in the computer science condition, perceived group evaluation predicted individual evaluation. Female participants, in contrast, did not negatively evaluate someone who challenged a STEM peer group norm. This study demonstrates that male peer groups may perpetuate the idea that computer science is for men through negative evaluation of in-group members who challenge those ideas, and in turn maintain their dominant position as the high-status group. Achieving equity in the computer science field will require a greater understanding of these peer group norms.","authors":["Luke McGuire","Emma Jefferys","Adam Rutland"],"meta":["March 2020Journal of Experimental Child Psychology 195","DOI:10.1016/j.jecp.2020.104845","Project: STEM Teens"],"references":["327869429_Gender_differences_in_individual_variation_in_academic_grades_fail_to_fit_expected_patterns_for_STEM","282129329_Challenging_Gender_Stereotypes_Theory_of_Mind_and_Peer_Group_Dynamics","280157009_Intersectionality_and_STEM_The_Role_of_Race_and_Gender_in_the_Academic_Pursuits_of_African_American_Women_in_STEM","277969952_I'm_not_scientifically_gifted_I'm_a_girl_implicit_measures_of_gender-science_stereotypes_-_preliminary_evidence","345636373_Judgments_and_reasoning_about_exclusion_from_counter-stereotypic_STEM_career_choices_in_early_childhood","324573474_The_Role_of_Competitive_and_Cooperative_Norms_in_the_Development_of_Deviant_Evaluations","319972050_Group_Norms_Intergroup_Resource_Allocation_and_Social_Reasoning_Among_Children_and_Adolescents","316630853_Programming_experience_promotes_higher_STEM_motivation_among_first-grade_girls","316630668_Social_Group_Membership_Increases_STEM_Engagement_Among_Preschoolers","278793499_Peer_Group_Norms_and_Accountability_Moderate_the_Effect_of_School_Norms_on_Children's_Intergroup_Attitudes","275101702_When_Does_the_In-Group_Like_the_Out-Group_Bias_Among_Children_as_a_Function_of_Group_Norms","273789179_Science_capital_A_conceptual_methodological_and_empirical_argument_for_extending_bourdieusian_notions_of_capital_beyond_the_arts_SCIENCE_CAPITAL","277575305_Children_and_Social_Exclusion_Morality_Prejudice_and_Group_Identity","268155138_Challenging_Gender_Stereotypes_Resistance_and_Exclusion","266028630_Ethnic_Variation_in_Gender-STEM_Stereotypes_and_STEM_Participation_An_Intersectional_Approach"]}
