{"id":"345135230_A_Data_Science_Enhanced_Framework_for_Applied_and_Computational_Math","abstract":"Aim/Purpose: The primary objective of this research is to build an enhanced framework for Applied and Computational Math. This framework allows a variety of applied math concepts to be organized into a meaningful whole. Background: The framework can help students grasp new mathematical applications by comparing them to a common reference model. Methodology: In this research, we measure the most frequent words used in a sample of Math and Computer Science books. We combine these words with those obtained in an earlier study, from which we constructed our original Computational Math scale. Contribution: The enhanced framework improves the Computational Math scale by integrating selected concepts from the field of Data Science. Findings: The resulting enhanced framework better explains how abstract mathematical models and algorithms are tied to real world applications and computer implementations. Future Research: We want to empirically test our enhanced Applied and Computational Math framework in a classroom setting. Our goal is to measure how effective the use of this framework is in improving studentsâ€™ understanding of newly introduced Math concepts.","authors":["Kirby McMaster","Samuel Sambasivam","Brian Rague","Stuart L Wolthuis"],"meta":["January 2018","DOI:10.28945/4032"],"references":["333945459_What_the_Best_College_Teachers_Do","280292270_Computational_complex_analysis","278710892_Applied_Mathematics_Body_and_Soul","234831085_A_Comprehensive_Introduction_to_Object-Oriented_Programming_with_Java","228728347_Two_gestalts_for_mathematics_logical_vs_computational"]}
