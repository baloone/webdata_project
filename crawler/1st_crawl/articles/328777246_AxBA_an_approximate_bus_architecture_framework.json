{"id":"328777246_AxBA_an_approximate_bus_architecture_framework","abstract":"The exponential growth in creation and consumption of various forms of digital data has led to the emergence of new application workloads such as machine learning, data analytics and search. These workloads process large amounts of data and hence pose increased demands on the on-chip and off-chip interconnects of modern computing systems. Therefore, techniques that can improve the energy-efficiency and performance of interconnects are becoming increasingly important.","authors":["Jacob R.
