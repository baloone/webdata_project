{"id":"355378122_OntoGender_-_An_Ontology_in_the_Domain_of_Gender_and_Sexuality","abstract":"Ontology-driven conceptual models are part of a prominent and growing area within Computer Science. Their use allows better knowledge about a domain, improving understanding, communication and analysis tasks. To develop OntoGender we worked not only on the domain of Studies in Gender and Sexuality, but also, we deepened in ontologies and Ontology Engineering, mainly UFO and SABiO, resulting in a more precise representation of the selected domain. The artifacts generated from this work were analyzed by a specialist in the field of Social Sciences, in such a way that the generated model was revised and adapted to better reflect the domain, as expected. Considering that the field of study is in a constant change, both in semantics and in terminology, the developed model expresses the current context, and we claim that it helps in a better understanding of gender and all its aspects. We hope that a better understanding of such a complex domain will have positive repercussions on society and in a prejudice that is often the result of little knowledge.","authors":["Luiz Rodrigues Meireles","Maria das Gracas Da Silva Teixeira","Ana Fernanda Inocente Oliveira"],"meta":["October 2021"],"references":["326989092_A_Comparative_Illustration_of_Foundational_Ontologies_BORO_and_UFO","316081610_Towards_an_Ontology_of_Goal-Oriented_Requirements","310742505_The_Sexual_Orientation_and_Gender_Presentation_of_Hijra_Kothi_and_Panthi_in_Mumbai_India","300141913_Improving_Model_Quality_Through_Foundational_Ontologies_Two_Contrasting_Approaches_to_the_Representation_of_Roles","286670309_SABiO_Systematic_approach_for_building_ontologies","285905598_Contribuicoes_feministas_para_o_estudo_da_violencia_de_genero","335381561_Creating_a_Queer_Ontology_The_Gender_Sex_and_Sexual_Orientation_GSSO_Ontology","332862698_Gender_A_useful_category_of_historical_analysis","322938343_Queering_Queer_Theory_in_Management_and_Organization_Studies_Notes_toward_queering_heterosexuality","321596058_Handbook_of_the_Sociology_of_Gender","250043651_A_Teoria_Queer_e_a_Sociologia_o_desafio_de_uma_analitica_da_normalizacao","226549712_General_Formal_Ontology_GFO_A_Foundational_Ontology_for_Conceptual_Modelling","221630979_Sweetening_ontologies_with_DOLCE","221394588_Towards_Ontological_Foundations_for_Agent_Modelling_Concepts_Using_the_Unified_Fundational_Ontology_UFO","220591341_Information_Systems_Planning_and_Development_Strategic_Postures_and_Methodologies"]}
