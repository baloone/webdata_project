{"id":"350547260_Machine_learning_workflows_identify_a_microRNA_signature_of_insulin_transcription_in_human_tissues","abstract":"Dicer knockout mouse models demonstrated a key role for microRNAs in pancreatic Î²-cell function. Studies to identify specific microRNA(s) associated with human (pro-)endocrine gene expression are needed. We profiled microRNAs and key pancreatic genes in 353 human tissue samples. Machine-learning workflows identified microRNAs associated with (pro-)insulin transcripts in a discovery set of islets (n=30) and insulin-negative tissues (n=62). This microRNA signature was validated in remaining 261 tissues that include nine islet samples from individuals with type 2 diabetes. Top eight microRNAs (miR-183-5p, -375-3p, 216b-5p, 183-3p, -7-5p, -217-5p, -7-2-3p and -429-3p) were confirmed to be associated with and predictive of (pro-)insulin transcript levels. Use of doxycycline-inducible microRNA overexpressing human pancreatic duct cell lines, confirmed the regulatory roles of these microRNAs in (pro-)endocrine gene expression. Whereas knockdown of these microRNAs in human islet cells reduced (pro-)insulin transcript abundance. Our data provide specific microRNAs to further study microRNA-mRNA interactions in regulating insulin transcription.","authors":["Wilson K.M.
