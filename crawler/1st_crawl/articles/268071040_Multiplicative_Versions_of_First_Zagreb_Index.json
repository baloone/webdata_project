{"id":"268071040_Multiplicative_Versions_of_First_Zagreb_Index","abstract":"The first Zagreb index of a graph G, with vertex set V(C) and edge set E(G), is defined as M-1(G) = Sigma(u is an element of v(G)) d(u)(2) where d(u) denotes the degree of the vertex v. An alternative expression for M, (G) is Sigma(uv is an element of v(G)) [d(u) + d(v) ]. We consider a multiplicative version of M-1 defined as Pi(1)*(G) = Pi(uv is an element of E(G))[d(u) + d(v)]. We prove that among all connected graphs with a given number of vertices, the path has minimal Pi(1)*. We also determine the trees with the second minimal Pi(1)*.","authors":["Mehdi Eliasi","Ali Iranmanesh","Ivan Gutman"],"meta":["January 2012MATCH Communications in Mathematical and in Computer Chemistry 68(1)","Project: On Szeged polynomial of graphs with even number of Vertices"],"references":["268248093_Further_properties_of_Zagreb_indices","266162222_Similarity_of_molecular_descriptors_The_equivalence_of_Zagreb_indices_and_walk_counts","265892158_Zagreb_indices","216146752_Some_Observations_on_Comparing_Zagreb_Indices","49589692_About_the_Zagreb_Indices","267109664_Multiplicative_Zagreb_indices_of_trees","234898712_Graph_Theory_and_Molecular_Orbitals_XII_Acyclic_Polyenes","223275427_Relations_between_Wiener_hyper-Wiener_and_Zagreb_indices","222254320_Graph_Theory_and_Molecular_Orbitals_Total_-Electron_Energy_of_Alternant_Hydrocarbons","37573402_Simple_Topological_Index_A_Newly_Devised_Index_Characterizing_The_Topological_Nature_of_Structural_Isomers_of_Saturated_Hydrocarbons"]}
