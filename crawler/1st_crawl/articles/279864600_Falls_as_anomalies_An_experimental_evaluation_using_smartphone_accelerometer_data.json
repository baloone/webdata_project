{"id":"279864600_Falls_as_anomalies_An_experimental_evaluation_using_smartphone_accelerometer_data","abstract":"Life expectancy keeps growing and, among elderly people, accidental falls\noccur frequently. A system able to promptly detect falls would help in reducing\nthe injuries that a fall could cause. Such a system should meet the needs of\nthe people to which is designed, so that it is actually used. In particular,\nthe system should be minimally invasive and inexpensive. Thanks to the fact\nthat most of the smartphones embed accelerometers and powerful processing unit,\nthey are good candidates both as data acquisition devices and as platforms to\nhost fall detection systems. For this reason, in the last years several fall\ndetection methods have been experimented on smartphone accelerometer data. Most\nof them have been tuned with simulated falls because, to date, datasets of\nreal-world falls are not available. This article evaluates the goodness of\nmethods that detect falls as anomalies, thus not requiring to be tuned with\nfall patterns. To this end, we compared traditional approaches with anomaly\ndetectors by experimenting on three different collections of accelerometer\ndata, and four different data representations. Results demonstrated that in\nmost of the cases, understanding fall patterns is not necessary to design a\ngood and effective fall detection method.","authors":["Daniela Micucci","Marco Mobilio","Paolo Napoletano","Francesco Tisato"],"meta":["February 2017Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing 8(1)","DOI:10.1007/s12652-015-0337-0","SourcearXiv","Project: Fall detection and activity recognition"],"references":["313510826_Can_europe_afford_to_grow_old","273803681_Can_Europe_Afford_to_Grow_Old","312538118_Support-vector_networks","301408492_Wearable_sensors_and_patient_monitoring_system_A_Review","301407876_A_real-time_fall_detection_system_using_a_wearable_gait_analysis_sensor_and_a_Support_Vector_Machine_SVM_classifier","300780040_Fall_Detection_for_Elder_People_Using_Single_Inertial_Sensor","298412360_A_Public_Domain_Dataset_for_Human_Activity_Recognition_using_Smartphones","283895364_Transition-Aware_Human_Activity_Recognition_Using_Smartphones","272229832_Predictors_and_Prognosis_of_Inability_to_Get_Up_After_Falls_Among_Elderly_Persons","271513141_Support_Vector_Networks","270790857_Sensor-Based_Activity_Recognition","261742741_Detecting_Falls_as_Novelties_in_Acceleration_Patterns_Acquired_with_Smartphones","261503285_Design_and_implementaiton_of_a_fall_detection_system_using_compressive_sensing_and_shimmer_technology","266786402_Fall_Detection_Systems_for_Elderly_Care_A_Survey","263659704_Discriminatory_analysis_non_parametric_discrimination_Consistency_properties"]}
