{"id":"244989902_Categorical_and_Geographical_Separation_in_Science","abstract":"We perform the analysis of scientific collaboration at the level of\nuniversities. The scope of this study is to answer two fundamental questions:\n(i) can one indicate a category (i.e., a scientific discipline) that has the\ngreatest impact on the rank of the university and (ii) do the best universities\ncollaborate with the best ones only? Using two university ranking lists (ARWU\nand QS) as well as data from the Science Citation Index we show how the number\nof publications in certain categories correlates with the university rank.\nMoreover, using complex networks analysis, we give hints that the scientific\ncollaboration is highly embedded in the physical space and the number of common\npapers decays with the distance between them. We also show the strength of the\nties between universities is proportional to product of their total number of\npublications.","authors":["Julian Sienkiewicz","Krzysztof Soja","Janusz Ho≈Çyst","Peter M.
