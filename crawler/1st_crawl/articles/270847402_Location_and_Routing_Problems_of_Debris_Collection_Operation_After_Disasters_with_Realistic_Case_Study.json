{"id":"270847402_Location_and_Routing_Problems_of_Debris_Collection_Operation_After_Disasters_with_Realistic_Case_Study","abstract":"Debris removal after disasters presents challenges unique to each disaster. The transportation routing as well as disposal sites issue will be the subject of this study. The uniqueness of debris collection operation is due to the limited access from one section to the other, as a result of the blocked access by debris. Therefore a new constraint i.e. access possibility constraint was added to the classical L-CARP. Case studies on a test network and on realistic instances based on estimates of debris due to likely large scale natural disaster in Tokyo Metropolitan Area have also been reported under various scenarios.
