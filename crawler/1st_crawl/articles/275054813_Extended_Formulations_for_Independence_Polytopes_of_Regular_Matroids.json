{"id":"275054813_Extended_Formulations_for_Independence_Polytopes_of_Regular_Matroids","abstract":"We show that the independence polytope of every regular matroid has an\nextended formulation of size quadratic in the size of its ground set. This\ngeneralizes a similar statement for (co-)graphic matroids, which is a simple\nconsequence of Martin's extended formulation for the spanning-tree polytope. In\nour construction, we make use of Seymour's decomposition theorem for regular\nmatroids. As a consequence, the extended formulations can be computed in\npolynomial time.","authors":["Volker Kaibel","Jon Lee","Matthias Walter","Stefan Weltge"],"meta":["September 2016Graphs and Combinatorics 32(5)","DOI:10.1007/s00373-016-1709-8","SourcearXiv"],"references":["261217439_Extended_Formulations_for_Sparsity_Matroids","258374154_The_matching_polytope_has_exponential_extension_complexity","230595717_Combinatorial_Optimization_Polyhedra_and_Efficiency","314320533_An_algorithm_for_determining_whether_a_given_binary_matroid_is_graphic","281891173_Submodular_functions_matroids_and_certain_polyhedra_Combinatorial_structures_and_their_applications","272195020_Subgraph_Polytopes_and_Independence_Polytopes_of_Count_Matroids","264545602_Theta_rank_levelness_and_matroid_minors","249012041_A_Short_Proof_that_the_Extension_Complexity_of_the_Correlation_Polytope_Grows_Exponentially","245275424_An_Algorithm_for_Determining_Whether_a_Given_Binary_Matroid_is_Graphic","228057867_Theory_of_Linear_and_Integer_Programming"]}
