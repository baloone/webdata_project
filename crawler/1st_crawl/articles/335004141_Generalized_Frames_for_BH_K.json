{"id":"335004141_Generalized_Frames_for_BH_K","abstract":"Frames play significant role in various areas of science and engineering. Motivated by the work of Chander Shekhar, S. K. Kaushik and Abas Askarizadeh, Mohammad Ali Dehghan, we introduce the concepts of K-frames for B(H, K) and we establish some result. Also, we consider the relationships between K-Frames and K-Operator Frames for B(H).","authors":["Rossafi Mohamed","Samir Kabbaj"],"meta":["August 2019Iranian Journal of Mathematical Sciences and Informatics","Project: Gabor Frames and Shift-invariant Spaces"],"references":["263976221_Generalized_frames_for_operators_in_Hilbert_spaces","252340981_Painless_Nonorthogonal_Expansions","325540567_An_introduction_to_frames_and_riesz_bases","267672743_G-frames_as_special_frames","248786774_Modules_Over_Operator_Algebras","244954656_A_Course_in_Operator_Theory","200524234_A_Class_of_Nonharmonic_Fourier_Series"]}
