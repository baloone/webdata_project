{"id":"324532947_A_slack-based_measures_for_improving_the_efficiency_performance_of_departments_in_Universitas_Malikussaleh","abstract":"Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is a data-oriented performance evaluation method that has a very satisfactory performance when there are multiple inputs and outputs presented in the form of set of peer Decision Making Units (DMU) . In the discussion of DEA, basically measures the efficiency of each DMU in specific performance based on DEA Efficiency Scores. In DEA, when there is a value of Non-Zero Input and Output Slacks then this often means inefficiency. This scalar measures directly with the input surplus and the output of the short decision of the decision making unit (DMU). Universitas Malikussaleh as one of the State Universities in Indonesia, it is necessary to follow the regulations of the Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education of the Republic of Indonesia (KEMENRISTEKDIKTI), one of which is the measurement of efficiency based on the number of lecturers research, the efficient use of resources included in the number of lecturers and employees, as well as students who can be accommodated based on efficiency me asurements using DEA. This paper will measure the efficiency of each department in Malikussaleh University and if there is an inefficient department then it will be measured based on slack-based measures to advise aspects that need attention so that the department can be efficient.","authors":["Dahlan Abdullah","Tulus Tulus","S.
