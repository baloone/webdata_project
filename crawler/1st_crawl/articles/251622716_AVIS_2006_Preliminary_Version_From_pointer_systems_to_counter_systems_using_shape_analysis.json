{"id":"251622716_AVIS_2006_Preliminary_Version_From_pointer_systems_to_counter_systems_using_shape_analysis","abstract":"We aim at checking safety properties on systems manipulating dynamic linked lists. First we prove that every pointer system is bisimilar to an effectively constructible counter system. We then deduce a two-step analysis procedure. We first build an over-approximation of the reachability set of the pointer system. If this over- approximation is too coarse to conclude, we then extract from it a bisimilar counter system which is analyzed via efficient symbolic techniques developed for general counter systems.","authors":["Sébastien Bardin","Alain Finkel","Étienne Lozes","Arnaud Sangnier"],"meta":["April 2012","Project: FAST and model checking"],"references":["246171000_Faster_acceleration_of_counter_automata","221403627_FAST_Fast_Acceleration_of_Symbolikc_Transition_Systems","221402859_TReX_A_Tool_for_Reachability_Analysis_of_Complex_Systems","29611777_Flat_Acceleration_in_Symbolic_Model_Checking","239552947_Toward_Symbolic_Verification_of_Programs_Handling_Pointers_1","238657102_Quantitative_Verification_of_Programs_with_Lists","225909763_Verifying_Programs_with_Dynamic_1-Selector-Linked_Structures_in_Regular_Model_Checking","221323221_Symbolic_Execution_with_Separation_Logic","220752148_The_Pointer_Assertion_Logic_Engine","29608052_On_Decidability_Within_the_Arithmetic_of_Addition_and_Divisibility"]}
