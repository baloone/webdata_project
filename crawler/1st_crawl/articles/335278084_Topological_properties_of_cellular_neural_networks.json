{"id":"335278084_Topological_properties_of_cellular_neural_networks","abstract":"Graph theory is a fundamental and energetic tool for designing and modeling a graph/network. There are certain topological indices based on degree, distance and eccentricity, etc. The topological indices essentially relate certain physio-concoction properties and bio-Activity to the corresponding synthetic and atomic structure. In this paper, our aim is to figure out degree-based topological indices mainly atom-bond connectivity (ABC), geometric-Arithmetic (GA), ABC4 and GA5 indices for cellular neural network (CNN) and give closed results of these indices for cellular neural network. Moreover, we also compute general Randi cindex R of CNN for = { 1 ,-1 , 1 2 ,-1 2 } only and give analytical closed form results. A 3D graph analysis for comparison of indices is also given.","authors":["Muhammad Imran","Muhammad Kamran Siddiqui","Abdul Qudair Baig","Waqas Khalid"],"meta":["August 2019Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems 37(1):1-10","DOI:10.3233/JIFS-181813"],"references":["328801996_On_topological_indices_of_poly_oxide_poly_silicate_DOX_and_DSL_networks","316666332_The_Edge_Version_of_Geometric_Arithmetic_Index_of_Polyomino_Chains_of_8-Cycles_and_Arbitrary_Carbon_Nanocones","299989455_Bond_Incident_Degree_BID_Indices_of_Polyomino_Chains_A_Unified_Approach","299397646_Computing_Topological_Indices_of_Honeycomb_Derived_Networks","297471122_Topological_Indices_Study_of_Molecular_Structure_in_Anticancer_Drugs_168","281511584_Computation_of_Certain_Topological_Indices_of_Nanotubes_Covered_by_C_5_and_C_7SUB","298706678_Bond_incident_degree_BID_indices_for_some_nanostructures","285853391_Computing_ABC4_index_of_nanostar_dendrimers","285842416_Computing_fifth_geometric-arithmetic_index_for_nanostar_dendrimers","281993886_An_atom-bond_connectivity_index_Modelling_the_enthalpy_of_formation_of_alkanes"]}
