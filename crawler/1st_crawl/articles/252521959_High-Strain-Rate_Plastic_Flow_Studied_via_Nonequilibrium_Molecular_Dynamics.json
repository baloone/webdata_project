{"id":"252521959_High-Strain-Rate_Plastic_Flow_Studied_via_Nonequilibrium_Molecular_Dynamics","abstract":"Recent experiments at strain rates reaching 0.1 GHz suggest a power-law dependence of solid-phase shear stress on strain rate. Novel nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations of plastic flow have been carried out. These steady-state isothermal calculations appear to be consistent with the present-day experimental data and suggest that the flows of metals can be described by a single physical mechanism over a range of strain rates from 10 kHz to 1 THz.","authors":["William Graham Hoover","Anthony J.
