{"id":"338783001_Entanglement_Verification_in_Quantum_Networks_With_Tampered_Nodes","abstract":"In this paper, we consider the problem of entanglement verification across the quantum memories of any two nodes of a quantum network. Its solution can be a means for detecting (albeit not preventing) the presence of intruders that have taken full control of a node, either to make a denial-of-service attack or to reprogram the node. Looking for strategies that only require local operations and classical communication (LOCC), we propose two entanglement verification protocols characterized by increasing robustness and efficiency.","authors":["Michele Amoretti","Stefano Carretta"],"meta":["January 2020IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/JSAC.2020.2967955"],"references":["336912424_Enhancing_distributed_functional_monitoring_with_quantum_protocols","333636944_A_Poisson_Model_for_Entanglement_Optimization_in_the_Quantum_Internet","331181683_Opportunistic_Entanglement_Distribution_for_the_Quantum_Internet","327187874_Multilayer_Optimization_for_the_Quantum_Internet","326379156_Entanglement_Availability_Differentiation_Service_for_the_Quantum_Internet","322202221_A_Survey_on_Quantum_Channel_Capacities","321994828_SimulaQron_-_A_simulator_for_developing_quantum_internet_software","299552823_Quantum_Proofs","235359816_Reliable_Entanglement_Verification","228109483_WITHDRAWN_Quantum_cryptography_Public_key_distribution_and_coin_tossing","221590221_Fast_quantum_byzantine_agreement","220976630_Distributed_Quantum_Computing","220439879_Entanglement_Verification_with_an_Application_to_Quantum_Key_Distribution_Protocols","13237765_Teleporting_an_unknown_quantum_state_via_dual_classical_and_Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen_channels","2200008_Experimental_procedures_for_entanglement_verification","330803945_A_Survey_on_quantum_computing_technology","326964138_Decentralized_base-graph_routing_for_the_quantum_internet","285945223_Quantum_Networking","265603271_Security_of_quantum_key_distribution","258067414_Proposed_Experiment_to_Test_Local_Hidden-Variable_Theories","255174599_Device-Independent_Entanglement_Quantification_and_Related_Applications","232028114_Fully_Device-Independent_Quantum_Key_Distribution","51933260_Reliable_Quantum_State_Tomography","49751600_Entanglement_Verification_with_Finite_Data","13245023_Ekert_AK_Quantum_Cryptography_Based_on_Bell's_Theorem_Phys_Rev_Lett_676_661","1904984_Exact_Quantum_Algorithms_for_the_Leader_Election_Problem"]}
