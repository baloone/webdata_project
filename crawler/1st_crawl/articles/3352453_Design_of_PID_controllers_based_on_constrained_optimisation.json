{"id":"3352453_Design_of_PID_controllers_based_on_constrained_optimisation","abstract":"A new design method for PID controllers is presented, based on\noptimisation of load disturbance rejection with constraints on\nrobustness to model uncertainties. The design also delivers parameters\nto deal with measurement noise and set-point response. Thus, the\nformulation of the design problem captures four essential aspects of\nindustrial control problems, leading to a constrained optimisation\nproblem which can be solved iteratively","authors":["H.
