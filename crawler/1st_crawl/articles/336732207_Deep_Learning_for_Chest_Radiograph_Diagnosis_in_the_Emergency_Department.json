Chest radiographs were analyzed with a commercially available DL algorithm. The performance of the algorithm was evaluated by determining the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity at predefined operating cutoffs (high-sensitivity and high-specificity cutoffs). The sensitivities and specificities of the algorithm were compared with those of the on-call radiology residents who interpreted the chest radiographs in the actual practice by using McNemar tests. If there were discordant findings between the algorithm and resident, the residents reinterpreted the chest radiographs by using the algorithm's output.ResultsA total of 1135 patients (mean age, 53 years Â± 18; 582 men) were evaluated. In the identification of abnormal chest radiographs, the algorithm showed an AUC of 0.95 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.93, 0.96), a sensitivity of 88.7% (227 of 256 radiographs; 95% CI: 84.1%, 92.3%), and a specificity of 69.6% (612 of 879 radiographs; 95% CI: 66.5%, 72.7%) at the high-sensitivity cutoff and a sensitivity of 81.6% (209 of 256 radiographs; 95% CI: 76.3%, 86.2%) and specificity of 90.3% (794 of 879 radiographs; 95% CI: 88.2%, 92.2%) at the high-specificity cutoff. Radiology residents showed lower sensitivity (65.6% [168 of 256 radiographs; 95% CI: 59.5%, 71.4%], P < .001) and higher specificity (98.1% [862 of 879 radiographs; 95% CI: 96.9%, 98.9%], P < .001) compared with the algorithm. After reinterpretation of chest radiographs with use of the algorithm's outputs, the sensitivity of the residents improved (73.4% [188 of 256 radiographs; 95% CI: 68.0%, 78.8%], P = .003), whereas specificity was reduced (94.3% [829 of 879 radiographs; 95% CI: 92.8%, 95.8%], P < .001).ConclusionA deep learning algorithm used with emergency department chest radiographs showed diagnostic performance for identifying clinically relevant abnormalities and helped improve the sensitivity of radiology residents' evaluation.Published under a CC BY 4.0 license.Online supplemental material is available for this article.See also the editorial by Munera and Infante in this issue.","authors":["Eui Jin Hwang","Ju Gang Nam","Woo Hyeon Lim","Sae Jin Park"],"meta":["October 2019Radiology 293(3):191225","DOI:10.1148/radiol.2019191225"],"references":["332212711_Development_and_Validation_of_a_Deep_Learning-Based_Automated_Detection_Algorithm_for_Major_Thoracic_Diseases_on_Chest_Radiographs","328914232_Development_and_Validation_of_a_Deep_Learning-Based_Automatic_Detection_Algorithm_for_Active_Pulmonary_Tuberculosis_on_Chest_Radiographs","328680397_ACR_Appropriateness_CriteriaR_Acute_Respiratory_Illness_in_Immunocompetent_Patients","316614309_ACR_Appropriateness_Criteria_R_Acute_Chest_Pain-Suspected_Pulmonary_Embolism","330099609_Increasing_Utilization_of_Chest_Imaging_in_US_Emergency_Departments_From_1994_to_2015","327875259_Development_and_Validation_of_Deep_Learning-based_Automatic_Detection_Algorithm_for_Malignant_Pulmonary_Nodules_on_Chest_Radiographs","322319200_Methodologic_Guide_for_Evaluating_Clinical_Performance_and_Effect_of_Artificial_Intelligence_Technology_for_Medical_Diagnosis_and_Prediction","321759252_Diagnostic_Assessment_of_Deep_Learning_Algorithms_for_Detection_of_Lymph_Node_Metastases_in_Women_With_Breast_Cancer","321755280_Development_and_Validation_of_a_Deep_Learning_System_for_Diabetic_Retinopathy_and_Related_Eye_Diseases_Using_Retinal_Images_From_Multiethnic_Populations_With_Diabetes","311164170_Development_and_Validation_of_a_Deep_Learning_Algorithm_for_Detection_of_Diabetic_Retinopathy_in_Retinal_Fundus_Photographs"]}
