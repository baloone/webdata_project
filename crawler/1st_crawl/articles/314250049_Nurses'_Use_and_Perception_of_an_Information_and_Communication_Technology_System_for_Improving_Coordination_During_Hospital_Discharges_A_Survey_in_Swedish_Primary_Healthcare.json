However, there is still a lack of knowledge about how often nurses use information and communication technology and the indicators related to its use. The aims of this study were to describe the indicators related to nurses' use of an information and communication technology system for collaboration between care levelsand toestimatewhether thelevel of usecanbe related to nurses' perceptions of the information and communication technology system's contribution to improve coordination during hospital discharges. A quantitative survey of 37 nurses from 11 primary healthcare centers was performed in a county in southern Sweden. The data were analyzed using descriptive and comparative analyses. The results showed that perceptions concerning the information and communication technology system's usability and time consumption differed between nurses who used the system and those who did not. Simultaneously, the nurses were rather unaware of the ability of the information and communication technology system to improve coordination during patient discharges.","authors":["Line Christiansen","Cecilia Fagerstr√∂m","Lina Nilsson"],"meta":["February 2017Computers, informatics, nursing: CIN Publish Ahead of Print(7):1","DOI:10.1097/CIN.0000000000000335"],"references":["281552617_Basic_ICT_adoption_and_use_by_general_practitioners_An_analysis_of_primary_care_systems_in_31_European_countries","249826047_Implementing_Embedding_and_Integrating_Practices_An_Outline_of_Normalization_Process_Theory","232766204_Searching_for_the_missing_pieces_between_the_hospital_and_primary_care_Mapping_the_patient_process_during_care_transitions","232742034_It's_like_two_worlds_apart_An_analysis_of_vulnerable_patient_handover_practices_at_discharge_from_hospital","47509182_Normalisation_Process_Theory_a_framework_for_developing_evaluating_and_implementing_complex_interventions","40833042_Unwanted_incidents_during_transition_of_geriatric_patients_from_hospital_to_home_A_prospective_observational_study","24233671_Barriers_to_use_of_information_and_computer_technology_by_Australia's_nurses_A_national_survey","6478121_Deficits_in_Communication_and_Information_Transfer_Between_Hospital-Based_and_Primary_Care_Physicians","301698257_The_influence_of_social_challenges_when_implementing_information_systems_in_a_Swedish_health-care_organisation","292211455_Healthcare_Managers'_Experiences_of_Leading_the_Implementation_of_Video_Conferencing_in_Discharge_Planning_Sessions","259605389_Information_exchange_between_registered_nurses_and_district_nurses_during_the_discharge_planning_process_Cross-sectional_analysis_of_survey_data","47791690_Factors_Associated_With_Nurses'_Informatics_Competency","45630616_Systematic_Review_of_Factors_Influencing_the_Adoption_of_Information_and_Communication_Technologies_by_Healthcare_Professionals","7336583_Computer_Use_in_an_Urban_University_Hospital"]}
