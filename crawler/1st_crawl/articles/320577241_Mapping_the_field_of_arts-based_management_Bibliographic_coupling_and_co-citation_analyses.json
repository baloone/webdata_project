{"id":"320577241_Mapping_the_field_of_arts-based_management_Bibliographic_coupling_and_co-citation_analyses","abstract":"The literature in the field of arts-based management acknowledges that the combination of formal and informal dimensions that artists see can provide valuable insights for modern entrepreneurs and business managers. Due to the progress achieved to date, this study aims to map the field of arts-based management based on a systematic review of 137 scientific articles published in refereed scientific journals from 1973 through 2015. Specifically, based on two different citation analysis methods – bibliographic coupling and co-citation –, the results allow for the identification of some of the most active and influential articles, journals and authors in the field, revealing rankings, collaboration networks and clusters of contributions to the literature. This type of analysis is important to enhance our understanding of the intellectual structure of the field, and can be used to support the identification of new lines for future research.","authors":["Fernando A.F.
