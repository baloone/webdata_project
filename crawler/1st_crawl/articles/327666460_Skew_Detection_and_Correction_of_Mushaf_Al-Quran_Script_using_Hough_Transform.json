Correction of the skewed scanned images is critical because it has a direct impact on image quality. In this paper, the authors proposed a method for skew detection and correction for Mushaf Al-Quran image pages based on Hough transform method. The technique uses Hough transform lines detection for calculating the skew angulation. It works for different version of Mushaf Al-Quran image pages which has skewed text zones. Moreover, it can detect and correct the skew angle in the range between 20 degrees. Experiment conducted on different Mushaf Al-Quran image pages shows the accuracy of the method.
