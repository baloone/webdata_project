{"id":"221670159_Reproducibility_of_the_Shanghai_academic_ranking_of_world_universities","abstract":"This paper discusses and copes with the difficulties that arise when trying to reproduce the results of the Shanghai ranking of world universities. Although the methodology of the ranking is a little ambiguous with regard to absolute (not relative to the best performer) scores on the six indicators that compose the ranking, the paper shows how to develop procedures to compute raw results and final relative scores. Discrepancies between estimated scores and the results of the Shanghai ranking are mostly associated with the difficulties encountered in the identification of institutional affiliations, and are not significant. We can safely state that the results of the Shanghai ranking are in fact reproducible.","authors":["Domingo Docampo"],"meta":["February 2013Scientometrics 94(2):567-587","DOI:10.1007/s11192-012-0801-y"],"references":["301788885_The_Network_Society_From_Knowledge_to_Policy","265108845_The_Network_Society_From_Knowledge_to_Policy_Edited_by","259094186_French_universities_and_the_2013_edition_of_the_Shanghai_ranking","252727031_Big_is_made_Beautiful_Some_comments_about_the_Shanghai_ranking_of_world-class_universities","248876087_Learning_to_Live_with_League_Tables_and_Ranking_The_Experience_of_Institutional_Leaders","271867831_The_Academic_Ranking_of_World_Universities","270761711_Using_Multivariat_Statistics","254335117_There_must_be_some_way_out_of_here","250133584_European_Higher_Education_under_the_University_Rankings","239991527_Fidell_Using_Multivariate_Statistics"]}
