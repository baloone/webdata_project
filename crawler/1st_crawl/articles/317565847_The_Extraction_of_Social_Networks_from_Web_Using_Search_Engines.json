{"id":"317565847_The_Extraction_of_Social_Networks_from_Web_Using_Search_Engines","abstract":"In this paper, our purpose is to create a large collection of related vocabularies and concepts to the userâ€™s favorite field (articles, people, conferences, books, etc.) from the available information on the infinite and vast source of web which is expressed in the form of social network. In the other words, we introduced a way to help the researchers to be able to specify their favorite topic in a particular field and by this way, observe and extract the social network of the related concepts to that topic. In order to extract the nodes of this network, we used the sampling of web pages through the Google search engine, text processing techniques, and information retrieval. The topic of the extracted social network in this research is the scientific conferences in the field of computer sciences. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of this method, the extracted network from the results of the search engine is compared with the scientific conferences available in the DBLP[1] database. The obtained results from the social network analysis showed that the extracted network is of very high accuracy.[1] Digital Bibliography and Library Project","authors":["Faranak Salman Mohajer"],"meta":["June 2017Journal of Applied and Advanced Research 2(3):170","DOI:10.21839/jaar.2017.v2i3.92"],"references":["326338339_POLYPHONET_An_Advanced_Social_Network_Extraction_System_from_the_Web","313097548_Who_With_Whom_And_How_Extracting_Large_Social_Networks_Using_Search_Engines","257921919_Publications'_Classification_Analysis_using_Concept_Lattices","228095933_Web_Data_Extraction_Applications_and_Techniques_A_Survey","222703446_How_Are_We_Searching_the_World_Wide_Web_A_Comparison_of_Nine_Search_Engine_Transaction_Logs","265295957_A_semantic_overlapping_community_detection_algorithm_based_on_field_sampling","261455571_Extraction_of_academic_social_network_from_online_database","259518511_NLP-based_faceted_search_Experience_in_the_development_of_a_science_and_technology_search_engine","257016013_Combining_social_network_and_semantic_concept_analysis_for_personalized_academic_researcher_recommendation","222826814_A_study_of_overlap_and_uniqueness_among_major_Web_search_engines","221022952_Semantic_analytics_on_social_networks_Experiences_in_addressing_the_problem_of_conflict_of_interest_detection","222424733_Flink_Semantic_Web_technology_for_the_extraction_and_analysis_of_social_networks","221653634_Fast_discovery_of_connection_subgraphs","221023670_Disambiguating_Web_appearances_of_people_in_a_social_network","221023570_POLYPHONET_an_advanced_social_network_extraction_system_from_the_Web"]}
