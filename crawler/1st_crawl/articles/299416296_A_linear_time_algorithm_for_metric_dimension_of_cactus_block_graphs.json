{"id":"299416296_A_linear_time_algorithm_for_metric_dimension_of_cactus_block_graphs","abstract":"An undirected graph has metric dimension at most k if there is a vertex set such that and , , there is a vertex such that , where is the distance (the length of a shortest path in an unweighted graph) between u and v. The metric dimension of G is the smallest integer k such that G has metric dimension at most k. A cactus block graph is an undirected graph whose biconnected components are either cycles or complete graphs. We present a linear time algorithm for computing the metric dimension of cactus block graphs.","authors":["Stefan Hoffmann","Alina Elterman","Egon Wanke"],"meta":["March 2016Theoretical Computer Science 630","DOI:10.1016/j.tcs.2016.03.024"],"references":["51916206_On_the_Complexity_of_Metric_Dimension","303151748_Leaves_of_trees","265818269_The_metric_dimension_of_amalgamation_of_cycles","237082684_Metric_Dimension_for_Gabriel_Unit_Disk_Graphs_is_NP-Complete","223217500_Landmarks_in_graphs","222514864_Resolvability_in_graphs_and_the_metric_dimension_of_a_graph","222447584_The_monadic_second-order_logic_of_graphs_I_Recognizable_sets_of_finite_graphs","222004038_Resolvability_and_the_upper_dimension_of_graphs","220632415_Metric_bases_in_digital_geometry","220442826_On_Metric_Generators_of_Graphs","220266619_On_Approximation_Complexity_of_Metric_Dimension_Problem","50347213_Cactus_Graphs_for_Genome_Comparisons","3186529_Uniqueness_of_solution_for_nonlinear_resistive_circuits_containing_CCCS's_or_VCVS's_whose_controlling_coefficients_are_finite"]}
