{"id":"299433024_La_formation_au_numerique_dans_les_etablissements_d'enseignement_superieur_des_espaces_d'heterogeneite_au_coeur_du_dispositif_C2i","abstract":"The increasing impregnation of digital across all spaces of French society (health, education, economy, environment, etc.) but also to all activity contexts (personal, professional, school, etc.) isn’t without involving the development of a multitude of associated uses. The increased need for digital skills in the workplace has led a number of universities to offer training in digital in order to respond to a request: C2i device. The present paper aims to question firstly how the different actors, in universities, imagine training in digital; on the other hand, this paper highlights the practical implementation of C2i device (conditions of organization, evaluation and certification methods). the proposed analyzes are based on the results of two quantitative surveys and one qualitative survey conducted with stakeholders in higher education, the world of work and associations.","authors":["Laurent Mell","Hélène Trellu"],"meta":["February 2016Distances et Médiations des Savoirs 13(13)","DOI:10.4000/dms.1372"],"references":["273865054_Culture_et_pratiques_numeriques_juveniles_Quels_usages_pour_quelles_competences","273852126_L'introduction_du_B2i_a_l'ecole_primaire_evaluer_des_competences_hors_d'une_discipline_d'enseignement","272438326_Apres_la_certification_B2i_vers_des_competences_sous-jacentes_et_socio-numeriques","270039424_Utilisation_des_TIC_sentiment_d'efficacite_personnelle_des_directions_d'ecole_franco-canadienne","270039062_Pistes_pour_une_mesure_de_la_competence_numerique","250286475_L'Advocacy_Coalition_Framework_Une_contribution_au_renouvellement_des_etudes_de_politiques_publiques","274042495_Education_et_reseaux_socionumeriques_des_environnements_qui_necessitent_une_formation","272800569_De_la_pertinence_de_l'etude_des_TICE_par_les_SHS"]}
