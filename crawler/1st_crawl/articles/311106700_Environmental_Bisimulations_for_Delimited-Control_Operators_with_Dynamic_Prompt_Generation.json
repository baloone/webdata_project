{"id":"311106700_Environmental_Bisimulations_for_Delimited-Control_Operators_with_Dynamic_Prompt_Generation","abstract":"We present sound and complete environmental bisimilarities for a variant of Dybvig et al.'s calculus of multi-prompted delimited-control operators with dynamic prompt generation. The reasoning principles that we obtain generalize and advance the existing techniques for establishing program equivalence in calculi with single-prompted delimited control. The basic theory that we develop is presented using Madiot et al.'s framework that allows for smooth integration and composition of up-to techniques facilitating bisimulation proofs. We also generalize the framework in order to express environmental bisimulations that support equivalence proofs of evaluation contexts representing continuations. This change leads to a novel and powerful up-to technique enhancing bisimulation proofs in the presence of control operators.","authors":["Andres Aristizabal","Dariusz Biernacki","Sergue√Ø Lenglet","Piotr Polesiuk"],"meta":["November 2016Logical Methods in Computer Science 13(3)","DOI:10.23638/LMCS-13(3:27)2017"],"references":["248499280_A_Mechanized_Bisimulation_for_the_Nu-Calculus","245067478_A_Simple_Proof_of_a_Folklore_Theorem_about_Delimited_Control","225247320_Bisimulations_for_Untyped_Imperative_Objects","221278517_Delimited_Control_in_OCaml_Abstractly_and_Concretely_System_Description","220997884_The_Marriage_of_Bisimulations_and_Kripke_Logical_Relations","220997464_Extensional_normalisation_and_type-directed_partial_evaluation_for_typed_lambda_calculus_with_sums","220997280_Small_bisimulations_for_reasoning_about_higher-order_imperative_programs","220676492_A_monadic_framework_for_delimited_continuations","220606975_Axioms_for_control_operators_in_the_CPS_hierarchy","220370562_From_Applicative_to_Environmental_Bisimulation","50983437_Polymorphic_Delimited_Continuations","2846845_A_Sound_and_Complete_Axiomatization_of_Delimited_Continuations","1958398_An_Operational_Foundation_for_Delimited_Continuations_intheCPSHierarchy","320627234_Logical_relations_for_coherence_of_effect_subtyping","304107530_Answer-Type_Modification_without_Tears_Prompt-Passing_Style_Translation_for_Typed_Delimited-Control_Operators","303968960_A_Bisimulation_for_Type_Abstraction_and_Recursion","281603089_Higher-order_languages_dualities_and_bisimulation_enhancements","268163977_Bisimulations_Up-to_Beyond_First-Order_Transition_Systems","265371850_Enhancements_of_the_bisimulation_proof_method","261055522_A_Higher-Order_Distributed_Calculus_with_Name_Creation","257144991_Delimited_control_in_OCaml_abstractly_and_concretely","228868791_A_Complete_Characterization_of_Observational_Equivalence_in_Polymorphic_l-Calculus_with_General_References","223630020_A_bisimulation_for_dynamic_sealing","221305620_A_Generalization_of_Exceptions_and_Control_in_ML-like_Languages","221241310_The_Impact_of_Higher-Order_State_and_Control_Effects_on_Local_Relational_Reasoning","221241148_Adding_delimited_and_composable_control_to_a_production_programming_environment","220997548_The_Theory_and_Practice_of_First-Class_Prompts","220997492_Representing_Monads","220404737_Environmental_Bisimulations_for_Higher-Order_Languages","2290090_Operational_Reasoning_for_Functions_With_Local_State"]}
