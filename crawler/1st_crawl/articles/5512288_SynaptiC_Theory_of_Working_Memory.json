{"id":"5512288_SynaptiC_Theory_of_Working_Memory","abstract":"It is usually assumed that enhanced spiking activity in the form of persistent reverberation for several seconds is the neural\ncorrelate of working memory. Here, we propose that working memory is sustained by calcium-mediated synaptic facilitation in\nthe recurrent connections of neocortical networks. In this account, the presynaptic residual calcium is used as a buffer that\nis loaded, refreshed, and read out by spiking activity. Because of the long time constants of calcium kinetics, the refresh\nrate can be low, resulting in a mechanism that is metabolically efficient and robust. The duration and stability of working\nmemory can be regulated by modulating the spontaneous activity in the network.","authors":["Gianluigi Mongillo","Omri Barak","Michail Tsodyks"],"meta":["April 2008Science 319(5869):1543-6","DOI:10.1126/science.1150769","SourcePubMed"],"references":["51345348_Neural_Networks_with_Dynamic_Synapses","283617666_Neuronal_correlate_of_visual_associative_long-term_memory_in_the_primate_temporal_cortex","277548745_S_HORT_-T_ERM_S_YNAPTIC_P_LASTICITY","274602608_Robust_Persistent_Neural_Activity_in_a_Model_Integrator_with_Multiple_Hysteretic_Dendrites_per_Neuron","247415129_The_Psychology_of_Learning_and_Motivation_Advances_in_Research_and_Theory_Vol_4","242554268_The_Organization_of_Behavior","242206551_Working_Memory","229091438_The_organization_of_behavior","227979535_Activity-dependent_properties_of_synaptic_transmission_at_two_classes_of_connections_made_by_rat_neocortical_pyramidal_axons_in_vitro","20507168_Short-Term_Synaptic_Plasticity"]}
