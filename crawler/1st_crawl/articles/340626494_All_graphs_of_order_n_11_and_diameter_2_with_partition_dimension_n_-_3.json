{"id":"340626494_All_graphs_of_order_n_11_and_diameter_2_with_partition_dimension_n_-_3","abstract":"All graphs of order n with partition dimension 2, n−2, n−1, or n have been characterized. However, finding all graphs on n vertices with partition dimension other than these above numbers is still open. In this paper, we characterize all graphs of order n≥11 and diameter 2 with partition dimension n−3.","authors":["Edy Tri Baskoro","Debi Oktia Hy"],"meta":["April 2020Heliyon 6(4):e03694","DOI:10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e03694"],"references":["264960330_On_the_metric_dimension_of_a_graph","250686251_The_partition_dimension_of_a_graph","222514864_Resolvability_in_graphs_and_the_metric_dimension_of_a_graph","220194359_Discrepancies_between_metric_dimension_and_partition_dimension_of_a_connected_graph"]}
