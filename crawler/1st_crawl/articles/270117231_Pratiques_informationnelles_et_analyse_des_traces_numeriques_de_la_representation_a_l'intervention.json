{"id":"270117231_Pratiques_informationnelles_et_analyse_des_traces_numeriques_de_la_representation_a_l'intervention","abstract":"The growth of digital spaces and the infiltration of ICT into a large number of everyday practices lead to an increasing production of digital traces. These traces are being analyzed by marketers and researchers but they are also used to filter and rank search results, possibilities for navigation, and - on social sites - the choice of people to meet. In this text we examine the analysis of digital traces as a mode of representation as well as a tool for intervention, organization, and governance.","authors":["Bernhard Rieder"],"meta":["December 2010","DOI:10.4000/edc.2249"],"references":["249285731_Who_Contacts_Whom_Educational_Homophily_in_Online_Mate_Selection","270819385_Computation_and_Human_Experience","220447062_The_Anatomy_of_a_Large-Scale_Hypertextual_Web_Search_Engine"]}
