{"id":"335132035_Face_Detection_Method_Based_on_Cascaded_Convolutional_Networks","abstract":"Deep learning achieves substantial improvements in face detection. However, the existing methods need to input fixed-size images for image processing and most methods use a single network for feature extraction, which makes the model generalization ability weak. In response to the above problems, our framework leverages a cascaded architecture with three stages of deep convolutional networks to improve detection performance. The network can predict face in a coarse-to-fine manner. We replace the standard convolution with a combination of separable convolution and residual structure in the network. Extensive experiments on the challenging FDDB and WIDER FACE benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves competitive accuracy to the state-of-the-art techniques while keeps real-time performance.","authors":["Rong Qi","Rui-Sheng Jia","Qi-Chao Mao","Hong-Mei Sun"],"meta":["August 2019IEEE Access PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2934563"],"references":["331852077_Adaptive_Makeup_Transfer_via_Bat_Algorithm","319164062_FaceBoxes_A_CPU_Real-time_Face_Detector_with_High_Accuracy","331931259_Malicious_code_detection_based_on_CNNs_and_multi-objective_algorithm","322060099_Detecting_Faces_Using_Inside_Cascaded_Contextual_CNN","319770820_Histograms_of_Oriented_Gradients_for_Human_Detection","319770430_Rich_feature_hierarchies_for_accurate_object_detection_and_semantic_segmentation","319035165_Synergy_between_Face_Alignment_and_Tracking_via_Discriminative_Global_Consensus_Optimization","318035763_Template_Adaptation_for_Face_Verification_and_Identification","317191956_Multi-Scale_Fully_Convolutional_Network_for_Fast_Face_Detection","313527089_Distinctive_image_features_from_scale-invariant_key_points"]}
