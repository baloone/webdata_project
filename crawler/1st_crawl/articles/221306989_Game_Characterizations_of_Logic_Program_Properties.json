{"id":"221306989_Game_Characterizations_of_Logic_Program_Properties","abstract":"A family of simple two-player games will be presented which vary by how play passes between players and by what constraint must be maintained by the players in order to avoid losing. The players are representable as interacting almost independent logic programs. A correspondence between winning strategies, well-founded dependencies, constructive ordinals and hyperarithmetic sets is presented. Complexity results can be obtained for logic program properties in a uniform way. This paper demonstrates the technique as applied to two apparently divers properties, each of a very high degree of undecidability.","authors":["Howard Blair"],"meta":["January 1995","DOI:10.1007/3-540-59487-6_8","SourceDBLP","Conference: Logic Programming and Nonmonotonic Reasoning, Third International Conference, LPNMR'95, Lexington, KY, USA, June 26-28, 1995, Proceedings"],"references":["221591753_Trees_Automata_and_Games","47377609_The_expressiveness_of_locally_stratified_programs","344043123_Logic_for_Applications","262350777_Logic_Programming","239592298_Foundation_of_Logic_Programming","221135737_Canoncical_Conservative_Extensions_of_Logic_Program_Completions","220394567_Extension_of_Gurevich-Harrington's_Restricted_Memory_Determinacy_Theorem_A_Criterion_for_the_Winning_Player_and_an_Explicit_Class_of_Winning_Strategies","220247170_The_Recursion-Theoretical_Complexity_of_the_Semantics_of_Predicate_Logic_as_a_Programming_Language","213878344_Confluent_Reductions_Abstract_Properties_and_Applications_to_Term_Rewriting_Systems_Abstract_Properties_and_Applications_to_Term_Rewriting_Systems","47377569_The_Complexity_of_Local_Stratification","30874399_The_Theory_of_Recursive_Functions_and_Effective_Computability"]}
