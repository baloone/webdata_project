{"id":"299038134_Specification_of_genetic_search_directions_in_cellular_multi-objective_genetic_algorithms","abstract":"When we try to implement a multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) with variable weights for finding a set of Pareto optimal solutions, one difficulty lies in determining appropriate search directions for genetic search. In our MOGA, a weight value for each objective in a scalar fitness function was randomly specified. Based on the fitness function with the randomly specified weight values, a pair of parent solutions are selected for generating a new solution by genetic operations. In order to find a variety of Pareto optimal solutions of a multi-objective optimization problem, weight vectors should be distributed uniformly on the Pareto optimal surface. In this paper, we propose a proportional weight specification method for our MOGA and its variants. We apply the proposed weight specification method to our MOGA and a cellular MOGA for examining its effect on their search ability.","authors":["Tadahiko Murata","H Ishibuchi","Mitsuo Gen"],"meta":["January 2001Lecture Notes in Computer Science","Conference: 1st International Conference on Evolutionary Multi-CriterionVolume: 1993"],"references":["216634494_Evolutionary_Games_and_Spatial_Chaos","14281797_Spatialization_and_greater_generosity_in_the_stochastic_Prisoner's_Dilemma","3575291_A_Niched_Pareto_Genetic_Algorithm_for_Multi-Objective_Optimization","2629039_Approximating_the_Nondominated_Front_Using_the_Pareto_Archived_Evolution_Strategy","243688781_Structured_Demes_and_the_Evolution_of_Group-Advantageous_Traits","230141482_Multiobjective_flow-shop_scheduling","229441663_Optimal_Two_and_Three_Stage_Production_Schedules_With_Set-Up_Time_Included","225140638_Can_altruism_evolve_in_purely_viscous_population_Evol","222044938_Multi-objective_genetic_algorithm_and_its_application_to_flowshop_scheduling","14281796_Cooperation_among_unrelated_individuals_Reciprocal_altruism_by-product_mutualism_and_group_selection_in_fishes","3421242_A_Multi-objective_Genetic_Local_Search_Algorithm_and_Its_Application_to_Flowshop_Scheduling","2465269_An_Overview_of_Evolutionary_Algorithms_in_Multiobjective_Optimization","2240388_Thiele_L_Multiobjective_Evolutionary_Algorithms_A_Comparative_Case_Study_and_the_Strength_Pareto_Approach_IEEE_Trans_on_Evolutionary_Computation_3_257-271"]}
