{"id":"346901101_Theories_for_design_and_analysis_of_robust_H_H_-_fault_detectors","abstract":"This paper deals with model-based fault detection and isolation problems, for linear time invariant systems subject to a large class of uncertainties and disturbances. A new approach based on non-smooth optimization techniques, is proposed to synthesize a state–space realization of the fault detection filter, within the H∞/H− setting. A set of new criteria for robust fault detection performance analysis is too proposed, using the generalized structured singular value theory. The proposed theories are illustrated on a satellite example, under a large class of nonlinear dependent uncertainties. Through a deep analysis of the example, it is shown how the H∞/H− design – μg analysis tools can serve as a general theory, to solve fault detection problems.","authors":["David Henry"],"meta":["November 2020Journal of the Franklin Institute 358(1)","DOI:10.1016/j.jfranklin.2020.11.006"],"references":["334131298_Methods_and_outcomes_of_the_COMRADE_project_-_Design_of_robust_Combined_control_for_robotic_spacecraft_and_manipulator_in_servicing_missions_comparison_between_between_Hinf_and_nonlinear_Lyapunov-base","320337719_Unknown_input_reduced_order_observer_based_synchronization_framework_for_class_of_nonlinear_systems","318665896_An_improved_particle_swarm_optimization_algorithm_based_on_comparative_judgment","323169371_Stationary_wavelet_transform_aided_design_of_parity_space_vectors_for_fault_detection_in_LDTV_systems","318612120_Structured_Robust_Control_Against_Mixed_Uncertainty","315464927_Fault_detection_and_isolation_method_based_on_H-H_unknown_input_observer_design_in_finite_frequency_domain","308876213_A_Model-based_diagnosis_method_for_transient_and_multiple_faults_of_AOCS_thrusters","286034746_New_unified_H_infinity_dynamic_observer_design_for_linear_systems_with_unknown_inputs","283990173_Robust_Model-based_Fault_Diagnosis_of_Thruster_Faults_in_Spacecraft","282057141_Fault_Diagnosis_of_the_Microscope_Satellite_Thrusters_using_HinfH-_Filters"]}
