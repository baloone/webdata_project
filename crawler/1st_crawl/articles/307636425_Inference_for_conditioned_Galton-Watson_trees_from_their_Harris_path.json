{"id":"307636425_Inference_for_conditioned_Galton-Watson_trees_from_their_Harris_path","abstract":"Tree-structured data naturally appear in various fields, particularly in biology where plants and blood vessels may be described by trees, but also in computer science because XML documents form a tree structure. This paper is devoted to the estimation of the relative scale of ordered trees that share the same layout. The theoretical study is achieved for the stochastic model of conditioned Galton-Watson trees. New estimators are introduced and their consistency is stated. A comparison is made with an existing approach of the literature. A simulation study shows the good behavior of our procedure on finite-sample sizes. An application to the analysis of revisions of Wikipedia articles is also considered through real data.","authors":["Romain Azaïs","Alexandre Genadot","Benoît Henry"],"meta":["September 2016Latin American journal of probability and mathematical statistics 16(1)","DOI:10.30757/ALEA.v16-21"],"references":["263116581_The_Asymmetric_Exclusion_Process_and_Brownian_Excursions_In_Honor_of_Gianni_Jona-Lasinio's_70th_Birthday","262576235_Functional_Data_Analysis_of_Tree_Data_Objects","337037411_One-dimensional_empirical_measures_order_statistics_and_Kantorovich_transport_distances","308953335_Statistical_Tests_for_Large_Tree-Structured_Data","305975173_Kac's_formula_levy's_local_time_and_brownian_excursion","298537500_Combinatorial_stochastic_processes_-_Saint-Flour_Summer_School_of_Probabilities_XXXII_-_2002","285667053_Sur_certains_developpements_suivant_les_polynomes_de_la_forme_de_S_Bernstein_I_II","268863379_Order_Statistics","265682317_Kac's_Formula_Levy's_Local_Time_and_Brownian_Excursion","265328171_Combinatorial_stochastic_processes_Ecole_d'Ete_de_Probabilites_de_Saint-Flour_XXXII_-_2002"]}
