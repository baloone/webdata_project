{"id":"278108002_Fuzzy_class_theory","abstract":"The paper introduces a simple, yet powerful axiomatization of Zadeh's notion of fuzzy set, based on formal fuzzy logic. The presented formalism is strong enough to serve as foundations of a large part of fuzzy mathematics. Its essence is elementary fuzzy set theory, cast as two-sorted first-order theory over fuzzy logic, which is generalized to simple type theory. We show a reduction of the elementary fuzzy set theory to fuzzy propositional calculus and a general method of fuzzification of classical mathematical theories within this formalism. In this paper we restrict ourselves to set relations and operations that are definable without any structure on the universe of objects presupposed; however, we also demonstrate how to add structure to the universe of discourse within our framework.
