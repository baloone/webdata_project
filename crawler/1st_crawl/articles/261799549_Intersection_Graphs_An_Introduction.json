{"id":"261799549_Intersection_Graphs_An_Introduction","abstract":"Intersection graphs are very important in both theoretical as well as\napplication point of view. Depending on the geometrical representation,\ndifferent type of intersection graphs are defined. Among them interval,\ncircular-arc, permutation, trapezoid, chordal, disk, circle graphs are more\nimportant. In this article, a brief introduction of each of these intersection\ngraphs is given. Some basic properties and algorithmic status of few problems\non these graphs are cited. This article will help to the beginners to start\nwork in this direction. Since the article contains a lot of information in a\ncompact form it is also useful for the expert researchers too.","authors":["Madhumangal Pal"],"meta":["April 2014","SourcearXiv"],"references":["280316392_Efficient_Algorithms_to_Solve_k-Domination_Problem_on_Permutation_Graphs","266170454_An_Optimal_Sequential_Algorithm_to_Compute_All_Hinge_Vertices_on_Circular-Arc_Graphs","321838029_One-dimensional_logic_gate_assignment_and_interval_graphs","304923731_Matrix_characterrizations_of_circular-arc_graphs","303177691_An_optimal_parallel_algorithm_for_computing_all_maximal_cliques_of_an_interval_graph_and_its_applications","284041712_Caracterization_des_graphes_non_orientes_dont_on_peut_orienter_les_arretes_de_maniere_a_obtenir_le_graphe_d'une_relation_d'ordre","268245223_An_efficient_algorithm_to_find_next-to-shortest_path_on_trapezoid_graphs","267677483_The_conditional_covering_problem_on_interval_graphs_with_unequal_costs","267446568_On_the_2-Chain_Subgraph_Cover_and_Related_Problems","266529254_Recognizing_weakly_chordal_graphs"]}
