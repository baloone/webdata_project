{"id":"317177785_Using_collaborative_learning_scenarios_to_teach_programming_to_non-CS_majors","abstract":"This article presents a new approach based on “collaborative scenarios” to enhance teaching–learning programming in non-Computer Science oriented curricula. In this context, a literature review of tools related to teaching programming since a collaborative approach is presented. The collaborative scenarios was supported by a platform called TASystem, and applied in a case study carried out with students from Topographic Engineering Department at the Universidad del Valle (Colombia). The students’ social interaction was analyzed with Social Network Analysis and Content Analysis techniques and so was the students’ performance. The results showed an improvement in the students’ performance and an increment in the social relationship among the students.","authors":["Leovy Echeverria","Ruth Cobos","Liliana Machuca-Villegas","Iván D.
