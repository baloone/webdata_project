{"id":"331406921_Corporate_Financial_Distress","abstract":"This introduction presents an overview of key concepts discussed in the subsequent chapters of this book. The book is devoted to default and bankruptcy prediction models, including the Altman Z‚Äêscore and its derivatives. It explores the various options, both in and out of court, for restructuring distressed firms. The book focuses exclusively on large business filings, primarily, and filings by public companies. It also explores the outcomes of bankruptcy cases. The book provides a comprehensive overview of the strategies employed by distressed investors and the returns and risk profiles of distressed debt. Four generic terms commonly found in the literature are failure, insolvency, default, and bankruptcy. Corporate failures and bankruptcy filings are a result of financial and/or economic distress. The continuous entrance and exit of productive entities are natural components of any economic system. Distressed restructuring is all about fixing failed firms. The two broad categories of bankruptcy filings are business and consumer filings.","authors":["Edward I.
