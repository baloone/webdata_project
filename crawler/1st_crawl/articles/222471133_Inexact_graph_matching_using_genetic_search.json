{"id":"222471133_Inexact_graph_matching_using_genetic_search","abstract":"This paper describes a framework for performing relational graph matching using genetic search. There are three novel ingredients to the work. Firstly, we cast the optimisation process into a Bayesian framework by exploiting the recently reported global consistency measure of Wilson and Hancock as a fitness measure. The second novel idea is to realise the crossover process at the level of subgraphs, rather than employing string-based or random crossover. Finally, we accelerate convergence by employing a deterministic hill-climbing process prior to selection. Since we adopt the Bayesian consistency measure as a fitness function, the basic measure of relational distance underpinning the technique is Hamming distance. Our standpoint is that genetic search provides a more attractive means of performing stochastic discrete optimisation on the global consistency measure than alternatives such as simulated annealing. Moreover, the action of the optimisation process is easily understood in terms of its action in the Hamming distance domain. We demonstrate empirically not only that the method possesses polynomial convergence time but also that the convergence rate is more rapid than simulated annealing. We provide some experimental evaluation of the method in the matching of aerial stereograms and evaluate its sensitivity on synthetically generated graphs.","authors":["Andrew D.J. Cross","Richard C.
