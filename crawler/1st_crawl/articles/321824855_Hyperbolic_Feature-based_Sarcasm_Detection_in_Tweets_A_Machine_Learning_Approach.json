{"id":"321824855_Hyperbolic_Feature-based_Sarcasm_Detection_in_Tweets_A_Machine_Learning_Approach","abstract":"In recent times, sarcasm analysis being one of the toughest challenge in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The property of sarcasm that makes it difficult to analyze and detect is the gap between its literal and intended meaning. Detecting sarcastic sentiment in the domain of social media such as Facebook, Twitter, online blogs, reviews, etc. has become an important task as they influence every business organization. In this article, a hyperbolic feature-based sarcasm detector for Twitter data is proposed. The hyperbolic features consist of intensifiers and interjections of the text. The performance of proposed system is analyzed using several standard machine learning approaches namely, Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and AdaBoost. The proposed system attains the accuracies (%) 75.12, 80.27, 80.67, 80.79, 80.07 using NB, DT, SVM, RF, and AdaBoost respectively.","authors":["Drsantosh Kumar Bharti","Reddy Naidu","Korra Sathya Babu"],"meta":["December 2017","DOI:10.1109/INDICON.2017.8487712","Conference: IEEE INDICON 2017At: India","Project: Sarcasm Sentiment Analysis in Tweets"],"references":["306524590_A_Pattern-Based_Approach_for_Sarcasm_Detection_on_Twitter","305995176_Detecting_Sarcasm_in_Multimodal_Social_Platforms","305680463_Enhanced_Sentiment_Classification_of_Telugu_Text_using_ML_Techniques","305324531_Sarcastic_Sentiment_Detection_in_Tweets_Streamed_in_Real_time_A_Big_Data_Approach","316594183_Sarcasm_Analysis_on_Twitter_Data_Using_Machine_Learning_Approaches","312607081_Building_a_large_annotated_corpus_of_english_The_penn_treebank","312538118_Support-vector_networks","309781364_Sarcasm_Analysis_on_Twitter_Data_Using_Machine_Learning_Approaches","305622270_Sentiment_Analysis_and_Opinion_Mining","303360625_Sarcasm_as_contrast_between_a_positive_sentiment_and_negative_situation"]}
