{"id":"301241864_Design_and_evaluation_of_layout_alternatives_to_enhance_the_performance_of_industry","abstract":"The present study provides an alternative way to handle the industrial layout\nproblems. A procedural approach has been proposed by the authors to design the\nlayout. The suggested approach consists of few easy and quite simpler steps. It only\nrequires to apply predetermined steps consisting some simple mathematical calculation.\nAn industrial layout problem has been resolved by adopting the suggested approach.\nThe developed layout alternatives of the considered case study have been simulated\nwith the ProModel tool for the evaluation purpose. The ranking of the alternatives has\nbeen carried out by the preference selection index (PSI) methodology. The output of the\nanalysis demonstrated that the layout alternative designed by the suggested approach\nranked higher as compared to the existing layout. A comparison of the proposed\napproach has also been carried out with the other approach from the literature.","authors":["Parveen Sharma","Sandeep Singhal"],"meta":["April 2016OPSEARCH 53(4):741-760","DOI:10.1007/s12597-016-0257-6"],"references":["290478526_Multi-criteria_analysis_of_supply_chain_risk_management_using_interval_valued_fuzzy_TOPSIS","272913655_Flexible_manufacturing_system_selection_using_preference_ranking_methods_A_comparative_study","269329480_Modeling_and_simulation_of_a_mattress_production_line_using_ProModel","259140704_Application_of_preference_selection_index_method_for_decision_making_over_the_design_stage_of_production_system_life_cycle","242344285_Systematic_layout_planning_A_study_on_semiconductor_wafer_fabrication_facilities","227297579_A_review_of_different_approaches_to_the_facility_layout_problems","313081090_A_heuristic_algorithm_and_simulation_approach_to_relative_allocation_of_facilities","308247808_Facility_layout_overview_Towards_competitive_advantage","293073411_Manufacturing_Facilities_Location_Planning_and_Design","293072852_Manufacturing_Facilities_Location_Planning_and_Design","289214433_Improving_Multi-Floor_Facility_Layout_Problems_Using_Systematic_Layout_Planning_and_Simulation","284760559_CORELAP-computerized_relationsip_layout_planning","281020594_Automated_Plant_Layout_Design_Program","279907398_FLEXIBLE_FACILITIES_DESIGN","279069612_Fast_local_search_for_single_row_facility_layout","276833196_Tabu_search_heuristic_for_efficiency_of_dynamic_facility_layout_problem","275672338_Solving_multi_objective_facility_layout_problem_by_modified_simulated_annealing","272375221_Safety-based_process_plant_layout_using_genetic_algorithm","271661138_A_comparative_study_of_GA_PSO_and_ACO_for_solving_construction_site_layout_optimization","271621057_A_fuzzy_DEMATEL-based_solution_approach_for_facility_layout_problem_A_case_study","264916243_Facility_layout_optimization_using_simulation_and_genetic_algorithms","264821540_The_selection_of_flexible_manufacturing_system_using_preference_selection_index_method","261299887_Systematic_layout_planning_A_study_on_coal_mine_facilities","259443622_Fuzzy_weighted_association_rule_based_solution_approaches_to_facility_layout_problem_in_cellular_manufacturing_system","257118967_An_integrated_AHP-NLP_methodology_for_facility_layout_design","255620430_Modified_SLP_for_Layouts_in_the_Production_of_Small_Items_Using_Small_Machinery","254423511_The_Single_Row_Facility_Layout_Problem_State_of_the_Art","243778338_Material_Handling_Principles_and_Practices","242412976_Plant_layout_and_material_handling","242341418_An_empirical_study_of_facility_layout_using_a_modified_SLP_procedure","233313816_An_applied_model_for_the_facilities_design_problem","229384078_A_selection_of_material_using_a_novel_type_decision-making_method_Preference_selection_index_method","227447838_A_Heuristic_Algorithm_and_Simulation_Approach_to_Relative_Location_of_Facilities","227445675_The_Dynamics_of_Plant_Layout","227443033_Quadratic_Assignment_Problem_Algorithms_and_the_Location_of_Indivisible_Facilities","223543812_Application_of_the_integrated_framework_for_the_plant_layout_evaluation_problem","223507648_Facility_layout_problems_A_survey","222863743_A_hierarchical_AHPDEA_methodology_for_the_facilities_layout_design_problem","221525437_Case_studies_in_applicatin_of_simulation_to_manufacturing_systems_simulating_the_furniture_industry","220564577_Integration_of_DEA_and_AHP_with_computer_simulation_for_railway_system_improvement_and_optimization","220384351_An_alternative_multiple_attribute_decision_making_methodology_for_solving_optimal_facility_layout_design_selection_problems","220216912_Facility_layout_using_weighted_association_rule-based_data_mining_algorithms_Evaluation_with_simulation","31612948_Systematic_layout_planning_R_Muther","26502811_Using_ProModel_as_a_simulation_tools_to_assist_plant_layout_design_and_planning_Case_study_plastic_packaging_factory","3623572_Genetic_search_for_facility_layout_design_under_interflows_uncertainty"]}
