{"id":"272794077_Max-Min_Intuitionistic_Fuzzy_Matrix_of_an_Intuitionistic_Fuzzy_Graph","abstract":"In this paper we introduce the Max-Min intuitionistic fuzzy matrix M (G) of an intuitionistic fuzzy graph. And the extreme energy of M (G) is defined. And also we give the explicit expression for the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of M (G). These concepts are illustrated with real time example.","authors":["G.
