{"id":"243788242_On_monochromatic_paths_in_m-coloured_tournaments","abstract":"We call the tournament T an m-coloured tournament if the arcs of T are coloured with m colours. In this paper we have proved that if T is an m-coloured tournament which does not contain any tournament of order 3 whose arcs are coloured with three distinct colours then there is a vertex v of T such that for every other vertex x of T there is a monochromatic path from x to v.","authors":["Shen Minggang"],"meta":["August 1988Journal of Combinatorial Theory Series B 45(1):108-111","DOI:10.1016/0095-8956(88)90059-7"],"references":["226488346_Monochromatic_reachability_complementary_cycles_and_single_arc_reversals_in_tournaments","223149024_On_monochromatic_paths_in_edge-coloured_digraphs"]}
