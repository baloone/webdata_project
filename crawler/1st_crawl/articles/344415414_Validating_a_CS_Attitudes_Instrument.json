{"id":"344415414_Validating_a_CS_Attitudes_Instrument","abstract":"This paper discusses the validation of a modified computer science attitudes instrument. Dorn and Tew’s Computing Attitude Survey was modified by adding questions on gender issues and questions regarding students’ perceptions of the utility of computing. Current trends indicate an increasing gap in the genders graduating with degrees in computer science. The new questions explore student attitudes and perceptions of women in computing while items related to computer science utility explore the importance of CS in students’ lives and careers. These modifications necessitated the re-validation of the new revised instrument and comparison of the results obtained with in the original instrument by Dorn and Tew.","authors":["Ryan Bockmon","Stephen Cooper","Jonathan Gratch","Mohsen Dorodchi"],"meta":["March 2020"],"references":["254272604_The_effects_of_age_gender_and_computer_experience_upon_computer_attitudes","328678407_Paving_a_path_to_more_inclusive_computing","303564880_A_Beginner's_guide_to_factor_analysis_Focusing_on_EFA","288066914_Relationships_Among_Computer_Self-Efficacy_Attitudes_Toward_Computers_and_Desirability_of_Learning_Computing_Skills","276398670_Empirical_validation_and_application_of_the_computing_attitudes_survey","271729841_Development_and_Validation_of_Scores_on_a_Computer_Programming_Self-Efficacy_Scale_and_Group_Analyses_of_Novice_Programmer_Self-Efficacy","271347990_Fennema-Sherman_Mathematics_Attitudes_Scales_Instruments_Designed_to_Measure_Attitudes_toward_the_Learning_of_Mathematics_by_Females_and_Males","268001177_A_Study_of_Factors_Promoting_Success_in_Computer_Science","254464157_Toward_a_validated_computing_attitudes_survey","244301037_Stereotype_Threat_and_Women's_Math_Performance","241575603_The_design_and_validation_of_the_Colorado_Learning_Attitudes_about_Science_CLASS_survey","236605201_Estimating_ordinal_reliability_for_Likert-type_and_ordinal_item_response_data_A_conceptual_empirical_and_practical_guide","230786782_The_Sources_of_Four_Commonly_Reported_Cutoff_Criteria_What_Did_They_Really_Say","242472131_Women_in_computer_science_reversing_the_trend","232502628_The_Application_of_Electronic_Computers_to_Factor_Analysis"]}
