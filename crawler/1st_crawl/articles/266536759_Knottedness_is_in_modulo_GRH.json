{"id":"266536759_Knottedness_is_in_modulo_GRH","abstract":"Given a tame knot K presented in the form of a knot diagram, we show that the\nproblem of determining whether K is knotted is in the complexity class NP,\nassuming the generalized Riemann hypothesis (GRH). In other words, there exists\na polynomial-length certificate that can be verified in polynomial time to\nprove that K is non-trivial. GRH is not needed to believe the certificate, but\nonly to find a short certificate. This result complements the result of Hass,\nLagarias, and Pippenger that unknottedness is in NP. Our proof is a corollary\nof major results of others in algebraic geometry and geometric topology.","authors":["Greg Kuperberg"],"meta":["May 2014Advances in Mathematics 256","DOI:10.1016/j.aim.2014.01.007"],"references":["234829876_Unknotting_is_in_AM_co-AM","233720792_Extremal_behavior_of_divisibility_functions","225168336_A_Polynomial_Quantum_Algorithm_for_Approximating_the_Jones_Polynomial","220431215_Proofs_that_Yield_Nothing_But_Their_Validity_for_All_Languages_in_NP_Have_Zero-Knowledge_Proof_Systems","220430433_Primality_Testing_Using_Elliptic_Curves","2928758_Primes_is_in_P","2422617_Elliptic_Curves_And_Primality_Proving","2139926_The_Computational_Complexity_of_Knot_and_Link_Problems","283361968_Elliptic_curves_andprimalityproving","280690051_Riemann's_Hypothesis_and_Tests_for_Primality","270033113_Dehn_surgery_the_fundamental_group_and_itshape_SU2","266981441_On_the_faithful_representation_of_infinite_groups_by_matrices","266246234_Residual_finiteness_for_3-manifolds","265637319_The_Complexity_of_Knots","265333403_Theorie_der_Normalflachen_Ein_Isotopiekriterium_fur_den_Kreisknoten","242511869_Effective_versions_of_the_chebotarev_density_theorem_algebraic_number_fields_l-_functions_and_galois_theory_a","223839601_On_Relationships_between_Statistical_Zero-Knowledge_Proofs","222813218_Finding_the_Number_of_Factors_of_a_Polynomial","222736823_Probabilistic_Algorithm_for_Testing_Primality","222679460_Quantifying_Residual_Finiteness","221591869_Private_Coins_versus_Public_Coins_in_Interactive_Proof_Systems","220617029_Every_Prime_Has_a_Succinct_Certificate","220574607_Arthur-Merlin_Games_A_Randomized_Proof_System_and_a_Hierarchy_of_Complexity_Classes","51945405_Recognizing_trivial_links_in_polynomial_time","45865864_How_hard_is_it_to_approximate_the_Jones_polynomial","36044832_Riemann's_Hypothesis_and_tests_for_primality","3083208_A_note_on_the_complexity_of_cryptography_Corresp","2265944_Hilbert's_Nullstellensatz_Is_in_the_Polynomial_Hierarchy","2183970_Simulation_of_Topological_Field_Theoriesby_Quantum_Computers","2112741_Non-triviality_of_the_A-polynomial_for_knots_in_S3","2110519_Noncyclic_Covers_of_Knot_Complements"]}
