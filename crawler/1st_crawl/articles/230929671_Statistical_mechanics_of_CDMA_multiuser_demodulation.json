{"id":"230929671_Statistical_mechanics_of_CDMA_multiuser_demodulation","abstract":"I investigate the multiuser demodulation problem which arises in code-division multiple-access (CDMA) systems. The relationship between the multiuser demodulation problem and a variant of the Hopfield model is established, based on which the replica analysis of some multiuser demodulation schemes is performed. Analytical results are presented for the maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) demodulation, the optimal demodulation, and the naive mean-field approximation to the optimal demodulation.","authors":["Toshiyuki Tanaka"],"meta":["January 2007EPL (Europhysics Letters) 54(4):540","DOI:10.1209/epl/i2001-00306-3"],"references":["231099356_Statistical_mechanics_of_error-correcting_codes","13236071_Finite_temperature_error-correcting_codes","3302078_Hopfield_Neural_Network_Implementation_of_the_Optimal_CDMA_Multiuser_Detector","2623055_The_belief_in_TAP","1950284_Statistical_mechanics_of_image_restoration_and_error-correcting_codes","1858831_The_Nishimori_line_and_Bayesian_Statistics","285849813_On_the_Multiuser_Detection_Using_a_Neural_Network_in_Code-Division_Multiple-Access_Communications","282444750_Image_Analysis_Random_Fields_and_Dynamic_Monte_Carlo_Methods","232772129_Spin-glass_models_as_error-correcting_codes","231086773_On_the_'naive'_mean-field_equations_for_spin_glasses","231038113_Exact_results_and_critical_properties_of_the_Ising_model_with_competing_interactions","230962665_Statistical_mechanics_of_image_restoration"]}
