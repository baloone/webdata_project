The methodology is also applied, especially to repair computer damage. The limitation of usersï¿½ knowledge on damage of computer components is a basic problem in handling the damage. This research aims to produce software diagnosing computer damage. This software also educates the public to use computers based on the standards; therefore, more severe computer damage requiring special handling is avoidable. The research result shows that the software diagnosing computer damage can work well and have guarantees of informing mistakes messages when users wrongly input the data. This software still needs further development in terms of characteristics, indications, and solutions of computer damage.","authors":["Sandy Kosasi"],"meta":["October 2015"],"references":["322164879_Pemilihan_Tipe_Handphone_Menggunakan_Metode_Penalaran_Berbasis_Kasus","45904880_Integration_of_Rule_Based_Expert_Systems_and_Case_Based_Reasoning_in_an_Acute_Bacterial_Meningitis_Clinical_Decision_Support_System","305000760_Software_Engineering_A_Practitioner's_Approach_8th_Ed","277875097_Teknologi_Penalaran_Berbasis_Kasus_Case_Based_Reasoning_untuk_Diagnosa_Penyakit_Kehamilan","240769882_A_Tutorial_on_Case-Based_Reasoning","222506930_Case-based_reasoning_is_a_methodology_not_a_technology","221996750_Artificial_Intelligence_-_A_Modern_Approach","220693558_Applying_Case-Based_Reasoning_Techniques_for_Enterprise_Systems"]}
