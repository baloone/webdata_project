{"id":"321873557_Data-driven_model_order_reduction_of_linear_switched_systems","abstract":"The Loewner framework for model reduction is extended to the class of linear switched systems. One advantage of this framework is that it introduces a trade-off between accuracy and complexity. Moreover, through this procedure, one can derive state-space models directly from data which is related to the input-output behavior of the original system. Hence, another advantage of the framework is that it does not require the initial system matrices. More exactly, the data used in this framework consists in frequency domain samples of input-output mappings of the original system. The definition of generalized transfer functions for linear switched systems resembles the one for bilinear systems. A key role is played by the coupling matrices, which ensure the transition from one active mode to another.","authors":["Ion Victor Gosea","Mihaly Petreczky","Athanasios C.
