{"id":"267037715_Modified_shifted_angular_spectrum_method_for_numerical_propagation_at_reduced_spatial_sampling_rates","abstract":"The shifted angular spectrum method allows a reduction of the number of samples required for numerical off-axis propagation of scalar wave fields. In this work, a modification of the shifted angular spectrum method is presented. It allows a further reduction of the spatial sampling rate for certain wave fields. We calculate the benefit of this method for spherical waves. Additionally, a working implementation is presented showing the example of a spherical wave propagating through a circular aperture.","authors":["Andr√© Ritter"],"meta":["October 2014Optics Express 22(21):26265-26276","DOI:10.1364/OE.22.026265"],"references":["265689714_Simulation_framework_for_coherent_and_incoherent_X-ray_imaging_and_its_application_in_Talbot-Lau_dark-field_imaging","258955259_Nonuniform_sampled_scalar_diffraction_calculation_using_nonuniform_fast_Fourier_transform","236739745_Computation_of_highly_off-axis_diffracted_fields_using_the_band-limited_angular_spectrum_method_with_suppressed_Gibbs_related_artifacts","236038101_Memory-efficient_reference_calculation_of_light_propagation_using_the_convolution_method","232228820_Computation_of_diffracted_fields_for_the_case_of_high_numerical_aperture_using_the_angular_spectrum_method","227398806_Calculating_the_Fresnel_diffraction_of_light_from_a_shifted_and_tilted_plane","49782233_Reference_calculation_of_light_propagation_between_parallel_planes_of_different_sizes_and_sampling_rates","45709229_Shifted_angular_spectrum_method_for_off-axis_numerical_propagation","40484001_Band-Limited_Angular_Spectrum_Method_for_Numerical_Simulation_of_Free-Space_Propagation_in_Far_and_Near_Fields","7254061_Fast-Fourier-transform_based_numerical_integration_method_for_the_Rayleigh-Sommerfeld_diffraction_formula","264248979_Numerical_solution_of_nonparaxial_scalar_diffraction_integrals_for_focused_fields","262955217_Diffraction_algorithm_suitable_for_both_near_and_far_field_with_shifted_destination_window_and_oblique_illumination","233828411_Wide-window_angular_spectrum_method_for_diffraction_propagation_in_far_and_near_field","51658614_Angular_spectrum_calculations_for_arbitrary_focal_length_with_a_scaled_convolution","26297994_Shifted_Fresnel_diffraction_for_computational_holography","6595412_Exact_analysis_of_the_effects_of_sampling_of_the_scalar_diffraction_field","5497090_Sampling_of_the_Diffraction_Field"]}
