{"id":"321781469_Satellite_Formation-Containment_Flying_Control_with_Collision_Avoidance","abstract":"This paper investigates the spacecraft formation-containment flying control problem to handle a scenario that a group of spacecraft effectively complete deep space explorations.In such scenario, the spacecraft can be divided into two categories, i.e., leader spacecraft with advanced sensors and follower spacecraft with general sensors. To make sure all leader spacecraft keep a desired relative configuration and fly with a constant velocity simultaneously, a cooperative formation control algorithm is proposed for each leader spacecraft. Then, to actuate all follower spacecraft converge into the convex hull spanned by the leader spacecraft for safety or navigation considerations, a distributed containment control algorithm is proposed for each follower spacecraft.One major contribution of the proposed algorithms lies in its collision avoidance capacity among all spacecraft by equipping close range omnidirectional relative distance sensor and employing the potential functions methodology. Finally, simulation results are provided to verify the formation-containment as well as collision avoidance performance of the proposed control algorithms.","authors":["Liangming Chen","Yanning Guo","Chuanjiang Li","Jing Huang"],"meta":["December 2017Journal of Aerospace Computing, Information and Communication 15(3)","DOI:10.2514/1.I010588","Project: Formation-containment control of multi-agent systems"],"references":["318993467_Distributed_Earth_Satellite_Systems_What_Is_Needed_to_Move_Forward","298428264_Decentralized_Consensus_Control_of_a_Rigid-Body_Spacecraft_Formation_with_Communication_Delay","319996229_Distributed_Observes_for_Cyberattack_Detection_and_Isolation_in_Formation-Flying_Unmanned_Aerial_Vehicles","317852887_Neural_network-based_distributed_adaptive_configuration_containment_control_for_satellite_formations","316176110_Satellite_and_Vision-Aided_Sensor_Fusion_for_Cooperative_Navigation_of_Unmanned_Aircraft_Swarms","313267997_Adaptive_neural_network_tracking_control_for_multiple_uncertain_Euler-Lagrange_systems_with_communication_delays","306246386_Coordinated_Dynamic_Behaviors_for_Multirobot_Systems_With_Collision_Avoidance","290789306_Formation_control_and_collision_avoidance_for_multi-agent_systems_based_on_position_estimation","286724035_Formation-containment_control_for_unmanned_aerial_vehicle_swarm_system","286048532_Collision-free_consensus_in_multi-agent_networks_A_monotone_systems_perspective"]}
