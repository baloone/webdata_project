{"id":"330077673_Scientific_Paper_Recommendation_A_Survey","abstract":"Globally, recommendation services have become important due to the fact that they support e-commerce applications and different research communities. Recommender systems have a large number of applications in many fields including economic, education, and scientific research. Different empirical studies have shown that recommender systems are more effective and reliable than keyword-based search engines for extracting useful knowledge from massive amounts of data. The problem of recommending similar scientific articles in scientific community is called scientific paper recommendation. Scientific paper recommendation aims to recommend new articles or classical articles that match researchersâ€™ interests. It has become an attractive area of study since the number of scholarly papers increases exponentially. In this survey, we first introduce the importance and advantages of paper recommender systems. Second, we review the recommendation algorithms and methods, such as Content-Based methods, Collaborative Filtering methods, Graph-Based methods and Hybrid methods. Then, we introduce the evaluation methods of different recommender systems. Finally, we summarize open issues in the paper recommender systems, including cold start, sparsity, scalability, privacy, serendipity and unified scholarly data standards. The purpose of this survey is to provide comprehensive reviews on scholarly paper recommendation.","authors":["Xiaomei Bai","Mengyang Wang","Ivan Lee","Zhuo Yang"],"meta":["January 2019IEEE Access PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2890388"],"references":["324787467_VOPRec_Vector_Representation_Learning_of_Papers_with_Text_Information_and_Structural_Identity_for_Recommendation","324023933_Artificial_Intelligence_in_the_21st_Century","322713534_Exploring_Human_Mobility_Patterns_in_Urban_Scenarios_A_Trajectory_Data_Perspective","321851510_PAVE_Personalized_Academic_Venue_recommendation_Exploiting_co-publication_networks","320733235_Concept-Based_Approach_for_Research_Paper_Recommendation","327006373_Low-Rank_and_Sparse_Matrix_Factorization_for_Scientific_Paper_Recommendation_in_Heterogeneous_Network","325200157_APRA_An_Approximate_Parallel_Recommendation_Algorithm_for_Big_Data","323370440_HAR-SI_A_Novel_Hybrid_Article_Recommendation_Approach_Integrating_with_Social_Information_in_Scientific_Social_Network","323156230_User_Participation_in_Collaborative_Filtering-Based_Recommendation_Systems_A_Game_Theoretic_Approach","321407638_Cross-Domain_Academic_Paper_Recommendation_by_Semantic_Linkage_Approach_Using_Text_Analysis_and_Recurrent_Neural_Networks","318931083_Paper_recommendation_using_citation_proximity_in_bibliographic_coupling","318737810_Mr_DLib_Recommendations-as-a-Service_RaaS_for_Academia","320574165_Academic_paper_recommender_system_using_multilevel_simultaneous_citation_networks","319406424_Scientific_Article_Recommendation_by_using_Distributed_Representations_of_Text_and_Graph","319045944_A_graph_based_approach_to_scientific_paper_recommendation"]}
