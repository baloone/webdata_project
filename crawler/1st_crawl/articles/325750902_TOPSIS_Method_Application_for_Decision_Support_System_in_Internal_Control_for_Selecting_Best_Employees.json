{"id":"325750902_TOPSIS_Method_Application_for_Decision_Support_System_in_Internal_Control_for_Selecting_Best_Employees","abstract":"The selection of the best employees is one of the process of evaluating how well the performance of the employees is adjusted to the standards set by the company and usually done by top management such as General Manager or Director. In general, the selection of the best employees is still perform manually with many criteria and alternatives, and this usually make it difficult top managerial making decisions as well as the selection of the best employees periodically into a long and complicated process. Therefore, it is necessary to build a decision support system that can help facilitate the decision maker in determining the best choice based on standard criteria, faster, and more objective. In this research, the computational method of decision-making system used is Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). The criteria used in the selection of the best employees are: job responsibilities, work discipline, work quality, and behaviour. The final result of the global priority value of the best employee candidates is used as the best employee selection decision making tool by top management.","authors":["Robbi Rahim","Supiyandi Supiyandi","Andysah Putera Utama Siahaan","Tri Listyorini"],"meta":["June 2018Journal of Physics Conference Series 1028(1):012052","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/1028/1/012052"],"references":["321800091_Comparative_Analysis_of_Membership_Function_on_Mamdani_Fuzzy_Inference_System_for_Decision_Making","321799910_Comparison_Searching_Process_of_Linear_Binary_and_Interpolation_Algorithm","321799147_Research_of_Simple_Multi-Attribute_Rating_Technique_for_Decision_Support","314952722_Decision_Support_System_Best_Employee_Assessments_with_Technique_for_Order_of_Preference_by_Similarity_to_Ideal_Solution","313316006_Implementation_of_Elimination_and_Choice_Expressing_Reality_ELECTRE_Method_in_Selecting_the_Best_Lecturer_Case_Study_STMIK_BUDI_DARMA","311986644_Study_of_the_Simple_Multi-Attribute_Rating_Technique_For_Decision_Support","301707919_Multiple_Attribute_Decision_Making_Based_on_Cross-Evaluation_with_Uncertain_Decision_Parameters","295247055_Interactive_TOPSIS_Based_Group_Decision_Making_Methodology_Using_Z-Numbers","285681429_Developing_TOPSIS_method_using_statistical_normalization_for_selecting_knowledge_management_strategies","299822611_Multi-criteria_decision_making_approaches_for_supplier_evaluation_and_selection_A_literature_review","271390238_Multiple-Criteria_Decision_Analysis_Using_Topsis_Method_For_Interval_Data_In_Research_Into_The_Level_Of_Information_Society_Development","267240858_Comparative_analysis_of_TOPSIS_and_Fuzzy_TOPSIS_for_the_evaluation_of_travel_website_service_quality","253241855_Application_of_TOPSIS_Technique_for_FinancialPerformance_Evaluation_of_Technology_Firms_in_IstanbulStock_Exchange_Market","262313647_Employee_Engagement_Organisational_Performance_and_Individual_Wellbeing_Exploring_the_Evidence_Developing_the_Theory","254300423_Recruitment_and_selection_services_Efficiency_and_competitive_reasons_in_the_outsourcing_of_HR_practices"]}
