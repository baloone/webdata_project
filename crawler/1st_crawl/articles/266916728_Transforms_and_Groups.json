{"id":"266916728_Transforms_and_Groups","abstract":"The fundamental properties of Fourier transforms derive from properties of locally compact abelian groups. Fourier transforms are group character transforms, and time-frequency duality is Pontryagin duality. Applications to block codes, MacWilliams identities and fast Fourier transforms are given.","authors":["G.David jun.
