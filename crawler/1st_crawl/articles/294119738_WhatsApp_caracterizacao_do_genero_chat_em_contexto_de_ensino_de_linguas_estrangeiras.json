{"id":"294119738_WhatsApp_caracterizacao_do_genero_chat_em_contexto_de_ensino_de_linguas_estrangeiras","abstract":"Digital information and communication technologies widely brought unquestionable advances in the fields of knowledge and social life. With the advent of these new technologies, meaning negotiation has become increasingly multimodal, that is, conventional methods of meaning negotiation by writing, for example, may link up with visual, oral, and gestural modes, among many others. Education can be configured as a space to enable and facilitate the new production of multiple meanings with the help of new technologies. Therefore, this paper proposes to present a characterization of the text genre chat through WhatsApp application, given its relevance and popularity among mobile users, by adopting Bakhtin’s perspective of speech genres (2003). The use of specific criteria for analysing the genre chat was the method applied. It is expected that the characterization of the genre may encourage the use of the instant messaging app as a support tool for teaching and learning a foreign language.","authors":["Natália Costa Leite","Marden Oliveira Silva"],"meta":["July 2015Texto Livre Linguagem e Tecnologia 8(1):85","DOI:10.17851/1983-3652.8.1.85-97"],"references":["299506819_A_EXPERIENCIA_DE_IMPLANTACAO_DE_UMA_ABORDAGEM_DE_ENSINO_DE_INGLES_VIA_GENEROS_NO_ENSINO_MEDIO_DO_CEFET-MG_SOB_O_PONTO_DE_VISTA_DOS_PROFESSORES","267771869_Research_for_practice_A_look_at_issues_in_technology_for_second_language_learning","240273373_Teaching_by_Principles_An_Interactive_Approach_to_Language_Pedagogy"]}
