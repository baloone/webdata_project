{"id":"220364508_A_fresh_approach_to_evaluating_the_Academic_Ranking_of_World_Universities","abstract":"The aim of this article is to present new ideas in evaluating Shanghai Universityâ€™s Academic Ranking of World Universities\n(ARWU). One issue frequently put forth in various publications is that the Shanghai rankings are sensitive to the relative\nweight they attribute to each variable. As a possible remedy to this issue, the statistical I-distance method is proposed\nto be used. Based on a sample containing the top 100 ranked universities, the results show a significant correlation with\nthe official ARWU list. However, some inconsistencies concerning European universities have been noticed and elaborated upon.","authors":["Veljko Jeremic","Milica Bulajic","Milan Martic","Zoran I Radojicic"],"meta":["June 2011Scientometrics 87(3):587-596","DOI:10.1007/s11192-011-0361-6","SourceDBLP"],"references":["226801311_Comparing_efficiency_in_a_cross-country_perspective_The_case_of_Italian_and_Spanish_state_universities","225119184_Irreproducibility_of_the_results_of_the_Shanghai_academic_ranking_of_world_universities","223739920_University_ranking_using_research_educational_and_environmental_indicators","220365510_Reply_to_the_comments_of_Liu_et_al","220365497_Comparing_university_rankings","220365310_Fatal_attraction_Conceptual_and_methodological_problems_in_the_ranking_of_universities_by_bibliometric_methods","216807887_International_rankings_and_quality_of_the_university_systems","216807851_On_using_the_Shanghai_ranking_to_assess_the_research_performance_of_university_systems","47394059_Ranking_of_banks_in_Serbia","46478990_Should_you_believe_in_the_Shanghai_ranking_An_MCDM_view_1","271867831_The_Academic_Ranking_of_World_Universities","228939197_1_Academic_Ranking_of_World_Universities_-_Methodologies_and_Problems","227129351_A_comparative_study_of_research_capabilities_of_East_Asian_countries_and_implications_for_Vietnam","226505163_Anchoring_Effects_in_World_University_Rankings_Exploring_Biases_in_Reputation_Scores","220365426_Uncovering_excellence_in_academic_rankings_A_closer_look_at_the_Shanghai_ranking","220365282_Academic_ranking_of_world_universities_using_scientometrics_-_A_comment_to_the_Fatal_Attraction","48139975_Ranking_of_rankings_Benchmarking_twenty-five_higher_education_ranking_systems_in_Europe","46554959_A_New_Approach_in_the_Evaluation_of_Team_Chess_Championships_Rankings"]}
