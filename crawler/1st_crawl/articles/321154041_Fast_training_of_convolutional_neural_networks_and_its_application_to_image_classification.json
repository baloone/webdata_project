While CNNs have been successfully applied to multiclass image classification tasks, the training speed is still very slow in the case of a large amount of data. In order to alleviate the problem of the training speed for CNNs, an extreme learning machine is adopted in this paper. An ELM is an effective training algorithm for neural networks having single hidden layer. The parameters of the hidden layer are randomly generated and the output weight of the ELM is calculated only once. The orthogonal bipolar vector is also adopted for improving the performance of ELM in determining the target outputs. After training CNNs with a limited epoch, we determine the output of the neural network using ELM. Experiments are performed by using MNIST, NORB, and CIFAR-10 datasets. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, we compare the training speed and the classification rate of conventional CNNs and the proposed method. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has a faster learning curve than the conventional CNNs while preserving classification accuracy.","authors":["K. Lee","D.-C.
