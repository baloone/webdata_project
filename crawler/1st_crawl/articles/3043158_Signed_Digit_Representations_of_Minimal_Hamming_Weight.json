{"id":"3043158_Signed_Digit_Representations_of_Minimal_Hamming_Weight","abstract":"A signed digit representation of an integer n in radix r is a sequence of digits a = (• ••, a2, a1, a0) with a, ∊ {0, ±1, • • •, ±(r — 1)} such that n = 03A3; ∞ a i=0,air1 Redundant representations of this form have been used successfully in many arithmetic applications, including the exponentiation problem in a group. Increased efficiency is usually derived from the possibility of having fewer nonzero digits than the standard radix r representation. Let kr(n) denote the minimal Hamming weight over all signed digit representations of n in radix r. In this correspondence, we give an on-line algorithm for computing a canonical signed digit representation of minimal Hamming weight for any integer n. Using combinatorial techniques, we compute the probability distribution Pr [kr = h] where Kris taken to be a random variable on the uniform probability space of fc-digit integers. Also, using a Markov chain analysis we show that e(kr) ~ (r — 1)k/{r + 1) as k → ∞.","authors":["S. Arno","F.S.
