{"id":"330169917_Data_replication_strategy_with_satisfaction_of_availability_performance_and_tenant_budget_requirements","abstract":"We propose a dynamic replication strategy that satisfies simultaneously availability and performance tenant requirements while taking into account the tenant budget and the provider profit. The proposed strategy is based on a cost model that aims to calculate the minimum number of replicas required to maintain a high data availability. A replica creation is triggered only when this number of replicas is not reached or when the response time objective is not satisfied. Then, the replication must be profitable for the provider when creating a new replica. Furthermore, data replication and query scheduling are coupled in order to place these replicas in a load balancing way while dealing with the tenant budget. The experiment results prove that the proposed strategy can significantly improve availability and performance while the tenant budget is taken into account.","authors":["Said Limam","Riad Mokadem","Ghalem Belalem"],"meta":["December 2019Cluster Computing 22(3)","DOI:10.1007/s10586-018-02899-6"],"references":["321805118_Ensuring_performance_and_provider_profit_through_data_replication_in_cloud_systems","318038195_Data_Replication_in_Cloud_Systems_A_Survey","312962666_Cost_Optimization_for_Dynamic_Replication_and_Migration_of_Data_in_Cloud_Data_Centers","308992679_A_Popularity-aware_Cost-effective_Replication_Scheme_for_High_Data_Durability_in_Cloud_Storage","316767957_Energy-efficient_data_replication_in_cloud_computing_datacenters","312484084_A_Performance_and_Profit_Oriented_Data_Replication_Strategy_for_Cloud_Systems","305463218_Pixida_Optimizing_data_parallel_jobs_in_wide-area_data_analytics","295867790_A_comprehensive_review_of_the_data_replication_techniques_in_the_cloud_environments_Major_trends_and_future_directions","293101685_RTRM_A_Response_Time-Based_Replica_Management_Strategy_for_Cloud_Storage_System","282740819_Data_Replication_Placement_Strategy_Based_On_Bidding_Mode_for_Cloud_Storage_Cluster"]}
