{"id":"349343676_Designing_and_Manufacturing_of_Automatic_Robotic_Lawn_Mower","abstract":"This study is about the manufacturing of a personified automatic robotic lawn mower with image recognition. The system structure is that the platform above the crawler tracks is combined with the lawn mower, steering motor, slide rail, and webcam to achieve the purpose of personification. Crawler tracks with a strong grip and good ability to adapt to terrain are selected as a moving vehicle to simulate human feet. In addition, a lawn mower mechanism is designed to simulate the left and right swing of human mowing to promote efficiency and innovation, and then human eyes are replaced by Webcam to identify obstacles. A human-machine interface is added so that through the mobile phone remote operation, users can choose a slow mode, inching mode, and obstacle avoidance mode on the human-machine interface. When the length of both sides of the rectangular area is input to the program, the automatic robotic lawn mower will complete the instruction according to the specified path. The chip of a Digital Signal Processor (DSP) TMS320F2808 is used as the core controller, and Raspberry Pi is used as image recognition and human-machine interface design. This robot can reduce labor costs and improve the efficiency of mowing by remote control. In addition to the use as an automatic mower on farms, this study concept can also be used in the lawn maintenance of golf courses and school playgrounds.","authors":["Juinne-Ching Liao","Shun-Hsing Chen","Zi-Yi Zhuang","Bo-Wei Wu"],"meta":["February 2021Processes 9(2):358","DOI:10.3390/pr9020358"],"references":["346035578_processes_Review_of_Artificial_Intelligence_Applied_in_Decision-Making_Processes_in_Agricultural_Public_Policy","344963090_Analysis_of_the_Weights_of_Service_Quality_Indicators_for_Drone_Filming_and_Photography_by_the_Fuzzy_Analytic_Network_Process","344147866_Neural_Network_for_Low-Memory_IoT_Devices_and_MNIST_Image_Recognition_Using_Kernels_Based_on_Logistic_Map","343345639_Optimization_of_FireNet_for_Liver_Lesion_Classification","343071542_Intellino_Processor_for_Embedded_Artificial_Intelligence","342680011_Non_Invasive_Skin_Hydration_Level_Detection_Using_Machine_Learning","342586065_Energy_Efficiency_of_Machine_Learning_in_Embedded_Systems_Using_Neuromorphic_Hardware","341455419_A_Review_of_Convolutional_Neural_Network_Applied_to_Fruit_Image_Processing","341374455_Determining_the_Precise_Work_Area_of_Agriculture_Machinery_Using_Internet_of_Things_and_Artificial_Intelligence","340947101_Integral_Seismic_Risk_Assessment_through_Fuzzy_Models","340864270_A_Smart_Glucose_Monitoring_System_for_Diabetic_Patient","339991922_Transfer_Learning_with_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_Diabetic_Retinopathy_Image_Classification_A_Review","339593485_Computation_of_Evapotranspiration_with_Artificial_Intelligence_for_Precision_Water_Resource_Management","337301831_Application_of_a_Fuzzy_Decision_Model_to_the_Design_of_a_Pillbox_for_Medical_Treatment_of_Chronic_Diseases","336838879_Service_robot_implementation_a_theoretical_framework_and_research_agenda"]}
