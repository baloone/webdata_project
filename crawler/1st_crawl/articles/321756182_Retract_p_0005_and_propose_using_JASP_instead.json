{"id":"321756182_Retract_p_0005_and_propose_using_JASP_instead","abstract":"Seeking to address the lack of research reproducibility in science, including psychology and the life sciences, a pragmatic solution has been raised recently: to use a stricter p < 0.005 standard for statistical significance when claiming evidence of new discoveries. Notwithstanding its potential impact, the proposal has motivated a large mass of authors to dispute it from different philosophical and methodological angles. This article reflects on the original argument and the consequent counterarguments, and concludes with a simpler and better-suited alternative that the authors of the proposal knew about and, perhaps, should have made from their Jeffresian perspective: to use a Bayes factors analysis in parallel (e.g., via JASP) in order to learn more about frequentist error statistics and about Bayesian prior and posterior beliefs without having to mix inconsistent research philosophies.","authors":["Jose Perezgonzalez","Dolores FrÃ­as-navarro"],"meta":["December 2017F1000 Research 6:2122","DOI:10.12688/f1000research.13389.1","Projects: Research practices.
