{"id":"332866578_Noise_prediction_of_the_ACAT1_fan_with_a_RANS-informed_analytical_method_success_and_challenge","abstract":"Comprehensive tests were conducted on the ACAT1 transonic fan of AneCom AeroTest in 2018. This paper reports on the comparison between the measurements and a RANS-informed analytical method for broadband noise prediction. The test campaign included the measurement of velocity components by hot-wire anemometry and pressure fluctuations by synchronised arrays of microphones at several stations in the rig. The tests were performed at the acoustic certification points (Approach, Cutback and Sideline), on two different working lines, and for two different rotor-stator spacings. The test data not only allow a direct comparison between prediction and measurement, they also enable assessing how acoustic trends are reproduced by the prediction method. The aerodynamic post-processed data relevant for rotor-stator interaction broadband noise such as the distribution of turbulence level in the interstage is compared to RANS Menter SST k-omega calculations. The acoustic power spectra deduced from the microphone measurements in the bypass sections and in the far-field forward arc are used to evaluate the acoustic results. The following conclusions can be drawn from this work: The spectral impact in dB between the different operating points and configurations is rather well predicted by the hybrid method. However, the overall sound power levels are underestimated by about 1 to 3 dB compared to the acoustic measurements even though the wake turbulence levels seem to be overestimated by the RANS approach compared to the hot-wire measurements. The results also evidence the fact that rotor-shielding needs to be accounted for to correctly predict forward-radiated broadband noise at high rotational speeds.","authors":["Sébastien Guérin","Carolin Kissner","Bojan Kajasa","Robert Jaron"],"meta":["May 2019","DOI:10.2514/6.2019-2500","Conference: 25th AIAA/CEAS Aeroacoustics ConferenceAt: Delft, The Netherlands"],"references":["325260827_Investigations_on_Analytic_Models_of_Broadband_Wake-Blade_Interaction_Noise","324676673_Separation_of_Tonal_and_Broadband_Noise_Components_by_Cyclostationary_Analysis_of_the_Modal_Sound_Field_in_a_Low-Speed_Fan_Test_Rig","323425145_Evaluation_of_analytical_aeroacoustic_models_for_a_low-speed_axial_ventilation_system","322305613_Large_Eddy_Simulation_of_a_Scale-model_Turbofan_for_Fan_Noise_Source_Diagnostic","316032267_Impact_of_Turbulence_Models_on_RANS-Informed_Prediction_of_Fan_Broadband_Interaction_Noise","282832595_Numerical_Predictions_of_TurbulenceCascade-Interaction_Noise_Using_Computational_Aeroacoustics_with_a_Stochastic_Model","260622659_Multidisciplinary_Optimization_of_Propeller_Blades_focus_on_the_aeroacoustic_results","228742295_Ten_years_of_industrial_experience_with_the_SST_turbulence_model","333197007_Radial_mode_breakdown_of_the_ACAT1_fan_broadband_noise_generation_in_the_bypass_duct_using_a_sparse_sensor_array","332866750_Assessment_of_a_2D_Synthetic_Turbulence_Method_for_Predicting_the_ACAT1_Fan's_Broadband_Noise","332863939_On_the_Use_of_RANS-informed_Analytical_Models_to_Perform_Broadband_Rotor-Stator_Interaction_Noise_Predictions","330533903_Aeroakustische_Auslegung_von_Triebwerksfans_mittels_multidisziplinarer_Optimierungen","323251091_A_unified_analytical_approach_for_the_acoustic_conceptual_design_of_fans_of_modern_aero-engines","318836487_Radial_mode_analysis_of_fan_broadband_noise","303601864_Airfoil_geometry_effects_on_turbulence_interaction_noise_in_cascades","299464532_Models_for_the_prediction_of_rear-arc_and_forward-arc_fan_broadband_noise_in_turbofan_engines","283633913_Two-Equation_Eddy-Viscosity_Turbulence_Models_for_Engineering_Applications","274141505_Fan_broadband_interaction_noise_modeling_using_a_low-order_method","268583940_Modeling_Broadband_Rotor_Interaction_Noise","268583869_Analytical_Prediction_of_Wake-Interaction_Noise_in_Counter-Rotating_Open_Rotors","268583810_Effect_of_CFD_Wake_Prediction_in_a_Hybrid_Simulation_of_Fan_Broadband_Interaction_Noise","268582271_Modelling_Broadband_Fan_Noise_and_Comparison_with_Experiments","265519182_Differential_Reynolds-Stress_Modeling_for_Aeronautics","256847570_Ducted-Fan_Broadband_Noise_Simulations_Using_Unsteady_or_Averaged_Data","256198307_Reassessment_of_the_scale-determining_equation_for_advanced_turbulence_models","253776337_Multimode_sound_transmission_in_ducts_with_flow","245354707_Unsteady_Aerodynamics_and_Aeroacoustics_of_a_High-Bypass_Ratio_Fan_Stage","243783084_Some_aspects_of_non-stationary_airfoil_theory_and_its_practical_application","238188294_Helicoidal_Surface_Theory_for_Harmonic_Noise_of_Propellers_in_the_Far_Field","232371790_Broadband_noise_prediction_of_fan_outlet_guide_vane_using_a_cascade_response_function","225024616_Similarities_of_the_free-field_and_in-duct_formulations_in_rotor_noise_problems","224998514_A_comparison_between_measured_and_predicted_fan_broadband_noise_due_to_rotor-stator_interaction","223313323_Computation_of_rotor_wake_turbulence_noise","222965693_Acoustic_radiation_from_an_airfoil_in_a_turbulent_stream","48907240_Modelisation_du_bruit_a_large_bande_de_soufflantes_de_turboreacteurs","24327986_Improved_NASA-ANOPP_Noise_Prediction_Computer_Code_for_Advanced_Subsonic_Propulsion_Systems","24317916_Theory_for_broadband_Noise_of_Rotor_and_Stator_Cascades_with_Inhomogeneous_Inflow_Turbulence_Including_Effects_of_Lean_and_Sweep","24288233_Interim_prediction_method_for_fan_and_compressor_source_noise"]}
