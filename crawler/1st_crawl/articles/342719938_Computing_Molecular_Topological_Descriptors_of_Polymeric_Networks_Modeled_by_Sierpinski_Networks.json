{"id":"342719938_Computing_Molecular_Topological_Descriptors_of_Polymeric_Networks_Modeled_by_Sierpinski_Networks","abstract":"Sierpinski networks constitute an extensively studied class of graphs of fractal nature applicable in topology, mathematics of Tower of Hanoi, computer science, and Chemical graph theory. Recently the properties of Sierpinski networks have been studied like physico-chemical properties, thermodynamic properties, chemical activity, biological activity, metric dimension and degree based topological indices. In this paper, we further extend the study of Sierpinski networks and computed Zagreb types molecular descriptors (molecular topological indices) and their variants.
