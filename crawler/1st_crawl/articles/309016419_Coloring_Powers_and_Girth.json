{"id":"309016419_Coloring_Powers_and_Girth","abstract":"Alon and Mohar (2002) posed the following problem: among all graphs $G$ of maximum degree at most $d$ and girth at least $g$, what is the largest possible value of $\\chi(G^t)$, the chromatic number of the $t$\\textsuperscript{th} power of $G$? For $t\\ge 3$, we provide several upper and lower bounds concerning this problem, all of which are sharp up to a constant factor as $d\\to \\infty$.\nThe upper bounds rely in part on the probabilistic method, while the lower bounds are various direct constructions whose building blocks are incidence structures.","authors":["Ross J Kang","fran√ßois Pirot"],"meta":["October 2016SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics 30(4):1938-1949","DOI:10.1137/15M1035422","Project: Distance coloring"],"references":["268899591_On_the_difference_between_consecutive_primes","247933560_The_nonexistence_of_certain_generalized_polygons","247011775_On_Maximal_Paths_and_Circuits_of_Graphs","244462698_Graph_Colouring_and_the_Probabilistic_Method","244418327_Asymptotic_choice_number_for_triangle_free_graphs","243038268_Some_unsolved_problems_in_graph_theory_Russian","232010514_The_Chromatic_Number_of_Graph_Powers","224983649_The_Distance-t_Chromatic_Index_of_Graphs","222472913_Coloring_Graphs_with_Sparse_Neighborhoods","216545811_Moore_graphs_and_beyond_A_survey_of_the_degreediameter_problem"]}
