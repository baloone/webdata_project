{"id":"328932982_Near-null_interferometry_using_an_aspheric_null_lens_generating_a_broad_range_of_variable_spherical_aberration_for_flexible_test_of_aspheres","abstract":"A null lens moving back and forth relative to a point source can generate variable spherical aberration for flexible test of aspheres. Different from the previous methods, variable spherical aberration null theory was developed by us to optimize the null lens. The optimized null was a plano-convex singlet containing a high order even asphere. Its attractive advantages are the simple structure and the broad range of testable surfaces. Most concave prolate conic and near conic surfaces with k·R value varying between 0 and about 70000mm and with smaller relative aperture than that determined by each k·R value can be tested. The testable asphericity range is between 0 and about 230λ. Relations among these testable surfaces were revealed as different groups of equidistant surfaces. To explicitly show the ability of the null, the measurable surfaces range map that contains all parameters defining a conic surface was offered. A practical near-null test system using this null was established. Alignment, near-null data processing, and error sources are analyzed in detail. To verify the broad testable surfaces range, three surfaces with widely varying amounts of asphericity were tested. Cross tests were provided to verify the test system accuracy","authors":["Shuai Xue","Shanyong Chen","Guipeng Tie"],"meta":["November 2018Optics Express 26(24):31172","DOI:10.1364/OE.26.031172","Project: Adaptive and flexible wavefront interferometry for complex surfaces"],"references":["326910298_Adaptive_wavefront_interferometry_for_unknown_free-form_surfaces","323864897_Pure_adaptive_interferometer_for_free_form_surfaces_metrology","316987811_One-dimensional_stitching_interferometry_assisted_by_a_triple-beam_interferometer","326913623_Model-based_adaptive_non-null_interferometry_for_freeform_surface_metrology","326740375_Model-based_adaptive_non-null_interferometry_for_freeform_surface_metrology","321036535_Modeling_near-null_testing_method_of_a_freeform_surface_with_a_deformable_mirror_compensator","318564035_Vertex_radius_of_curvature_error_measurement_of_aspheric_surface_based_on_slope_asphericity_in_partial_compensation_interferometry","316312783_Verification_and_in_situ_calibration_of_large-aperture_null_correctors_for_convex_aspheric_mirrors","312324275_Subaperture_stitching_test_of_convex_aspheres_by_using_the_reconfigurable_optical_null","311765383_Quasi-absolute_surface_figure_test_with_two_orthogonal_transverse_spatial_shifts"]}
