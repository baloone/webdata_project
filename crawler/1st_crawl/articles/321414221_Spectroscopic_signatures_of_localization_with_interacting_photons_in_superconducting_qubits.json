{"id":"321414221_Spectroscopic_signatures_of_localization_with_interacting_photons_in_superconducting_qubits","abstract":"Quantized eigenenergies and their associated wave functions provide extensive information for predicting the physics of quantum many-body systems. Using a chain of nine superconducting qubits, we implement a technique for resolving the energy levels of interacting photons. We benchmark this method by capturing the main features of the intricate energy spectrum predicted for two-dimensional electrons in a magnetic fieldâ€”the Hofstadter butterfly. We introduce disorder to study the statistics of the energy levels of the system as it undergoes the transition from a thermalized to a localized phase. Our work introduces a many-body spectroscopy technique to study quantum phases of matter.","authors":["P. Roushan","C. Neill","Jirawat Tangpanitanon","Victor M.
