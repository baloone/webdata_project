{"id":"329520475_The_Norwegian_Model_in_Norway","abstract":"The “Norwegian Model” attempts to comprehensively cover all the peer-reviewed scholarly literatures in all areas of research in one single weighted indicator. Thereby, scientific production is made comparable across departments and faculties within and between research institutions, and the indicator may serve institutional evaluation and funding. This article describes the motivation for creating the model in Norway, how it was designed, organized and implemented, as well as the effects and experiences with the model. The article ends with an overview of a new type of bibliometric studies that are based on the type of comprehensive national publication data that the Norwegian Model provides.","authors":["Gunnar Sivertsen"],"meta":["December 2018Journal of Data and Information Science 3(4):2-18","DOI:10.2478/jdis-2018-0017"],"references":["332172348_Measuring_scientific_contributions_with_modified_fractional_counting","325788985_Performance-based_research_funding_in_EU_Member_States_-_A_comparative_assessment","324013015_Publication_patterns_in_the_social_sciences_and_humanities_evidence_from_eight_European_countries","319131355_Unique_but_still_best_practice_The_Research_Excellence_Framework_REF_from_an_international_perspective","310607261_Quantity_andor_Quality_The_Importance_of_Publishing_Many_Papers","308738969_How_Many_Is_Too_Many_On_the_Relationship_between_Research_Productivity_and_Impact","316285107_Scholarly_book_publishing_Its_information_sources_for_evaluation_in_the_social_sciences_and_humanities","312316289_Assessing_publications_through_a_bibliometric_indicator_The_case_of_comprehensive_evaluation_of_scientific_units_in_Poland","309880061_Analysis_of_intra-institutional_research_collaboration_a_case_of_a_Serbian_faculty_of_sciences","309183410_Integrating_metrics_to_measure_research_performance_in_social_sciences_and_humanities_The_case_of_the_Spanish_CSIC"]}
