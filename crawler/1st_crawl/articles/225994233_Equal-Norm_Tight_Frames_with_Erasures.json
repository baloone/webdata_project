{"id":"225994233_Equal-Norm_Tight_Frames_with_Erasures","abstract":"Equal-norm tight frames have been shown to be useful for robust data transmission. The losses in the network are modeled as erasures of transmitted frame coefficients. We give the first systematic study of the general class of equal-norm tight frames and their properties. We search for efficient constructions of such frames. We show that the only equal-norm tight frames with the group structure and one or two generators are the generalized harmonic frames. Finally, we give a complete classification of frames in terms of their robustness to erasures.","authors":["Peter G.
