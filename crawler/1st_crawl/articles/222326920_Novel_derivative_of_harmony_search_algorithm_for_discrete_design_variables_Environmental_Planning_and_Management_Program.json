{"id":"222326920_Novel_derivative_of_harmony_search_algorithm_for_discrete_design_variables_Environmental_Planning_and_Management_Program","abstract":"Calculus has widespread applications in science and engineering. Optimization is one of its major subjects, where a problem can be mathematically formulated and its optimal solution is determined by using derivatives. However, this calculus-based derivative technique can only be applied to real-valued or continuous-valued functions rather than discrete-valued functions while there are many situations where design variables contain not continuous values but discrete values by nature. In order to consider these realistic design situations, this study proposes a novel derivative for discrete design variables based on a harmony search algorithm. Detailed analysis shows how this new stochastic derivative works in the bench-mark function and fluid-transport network design. Hopefully this new derivative, as a fundamental technology, will be utilized in various science and engineering problems.","authors":["Zong Woo Geem"],"meta":["May 2008Applied Mathematics and Computation 199(1):223-230","DOI:10.1016/j.amc.2007.09.049","SourceDBLP"],"references":["250693983_Optimal_cost_design_of_water_distribution_networks_using_harmony_search","225173979_Harmony_Search_for_Generalized_Orienteering_Problem_Best_Touring_in_China","220164617_A_New_Heuristic_Optimization_Algorithm_Harmony_Search","26439726_Application_of_Harmony_Search_to_Vehicle_Routing","279619373_Location_of_non-circular_slip_surface_using_the_modified_harmony_search_method_based_on_correcting_strategy","267649696_Mooring_Cost_Optimization_via_Harmony_Search","245310596_The_harmony_search_heuristic_algorithm_for_discrete_structural_optimization","223786072_Simultaneous_determination_of_aquifer_parameters_and_zone_structures_with_fuzzy_c-means_clustering_and_meta-heuristic_harmony_search_algorithm","223605891_Combined_heat_and_power_economic_dispatch_by_harmony_search_algorithm","222814768_An_improved_harmony_search_algorithm_for_solving_optimization_problems","222426583_A_new_meta-heuristic_algorithm_for_continuous_engineering_optimization_Harmony_search_theory_and_practice","221583157_Optimal_Scheduling_of_Multiple_Dam_System_Using_Harmony_Search_Algorithm","221021392_Harmony_Search_Algorithm_for_Solving_Sudoku","221020997_Improved_Harmony_Search_from_Ensemble_of_Music_Players","220867583_Music_Composition_Using_Harmony_Search_Algorithm","48447529_HydroSystems_Engineering_and_Management"]}
