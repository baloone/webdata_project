{"id":"347919009_A_rate_threshold_mechanism_regulates_MAPK_stress_signaling_and_survival","abstract":"Cells are exposed to changes in extracellular stimulus concentration that vary as a function of rate. However, how cells integrate information conveyed from stimulation rate along with concentration remains poorly understood. Here, we examined how varying the rate of stress application alters budding yeast mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling and cell behavior at the single-cell level. We show that signaling depends on a rate threshold that operates in conjunction with stimulus concentration to determine the timing of MAPK signaling during rate-varying stimulus treatments. We also discovered that the stimulation rate threshold and stimulation rate-dependent cell survival are sensitive to changes in the expression levels of the Ptp2 phosphatase, but not of another phosphatase that similarly regulates osmostress signaling during switch-like treatments. Our results demonstrate that stimulation rate is a regulated determinant of cell behavior and provide a paradigm to guide the dissection of major stimulation rate dependent mechanisms in other systems.","authors":["Amanda N.
