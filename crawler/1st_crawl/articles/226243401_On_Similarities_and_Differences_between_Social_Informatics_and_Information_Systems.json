{"id":"226243401_On_Similarities_and_Differences_between_Social_Informatics_and_Information_Systems","abstract":"Rob Kling strongly advocated the term Social Informatics. He demonstrated that equipment, equipment vendors, technical specialists,\nupper-level managers, ICT policies, internal funding, and external grant funding with the people who will use information\nsystems in the course of other work are not simply a static list but are interrelated within a matrix of social and technical\ndependencies. In Information Systems there has recently been heated debate about the core content of the discipline. In this\npaper we study whether Social Informatics and Information Systems are similar or not. According to the broad view on Information\nSystems, they appear quite similar. The few differences we identified are in research approaches, when most Social Informatics\nresearchers use intensive case studies while most Information Systems researchers surveys. Such minor differences do not support\nthe view that these two sciences should have different names. The researchers in both sciences seem to believe that people’s\nbehavior can be predicted, but we demonstrate that this is not true. Hence we propose that theories with people as a component\nmust be adjusted accordingly in both sciences.","authors":["Pertti Järvinen"],"meta":["January 2007IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 223:395-406","DOI:10.1007/978-0-387-37876-3_31","Conference: IFIP International Conference on Human Choice and Computers"],"references":["228866136_2003a_Sidestepping_the_IT_Artifact_Scrapping_the_IS_Silo_and_Laying_Claim_to_'Systems_in_Organizations","220079919_Studying_Information_Technology_in_Organizations_Research_Approaches_and_Assumptions","201168946_Design_Science_in_Information_Systems_Research","30062926_Design_Theory_in_Information_Systems","318494425_Toward_a_Critical_Technical_Practice_Lessons_Learned_in_Trying_to_Reform_AI","298866872_The_Information_Systems_Identity_Crisis_Focusing_on_High-Visibility_and_High-Impact_Research","288947775_Research_commentry_Desperately_seeking_the_IT_in_IT_research_-_A_call_to_theorizing_the_IT_artifact","256852152_Design_Science_in_Information_Systems_Research","234821131_Curriculum_Recommendations_for_Graduate_Professional_Programs_in_Information_Systems","234810026_IT_and_organizational_change_in_digital_economies","234771137_The_State_of_Computer_Oriented_Curricula_in_Business_Schools_1970","228732122_The_Formulation_of_Design_Theories_for_Information_Systems","227447617_The_Evolution_of_Research_on_Information_Systems_A_Fiftieth-Year_Survey_of_the_Literature_in_Management_Science","220985029_Information_Systems_Conceptual_Foundations_Looking_Backward_and_Forward","220424451_Education_Related_to_the_Use_of_Computers_in_Organizations","220260029_The_Identity_Crisis_Within_the_IS_Discipline_Defining_and_Communicating_the_Discipline's_Core_Properties","220259991_A_Set_of_Principles_for_Conducting_and_Evaluating_Interpretive_Field_Studies_in_Information_Systems","220175264_Learning_About_Information_Technologies_and_Social_Change_The_Contribution_of_Social_Informatics","201169015_Research_Commentary_Desperately_Seeking_the_IT_in_IT_Research--A_Call_to_Theorizing_the_IT_Artifact","2488922_What_Is_Social_Informatics_and_Why_Does_It_Matter"]}
