{"id":"222522486_Nontexture_Inpainting_by_Curvature-Driven_Diffusions","abstract":"Inpainting is an image interpolation problem, often referring to interpolations over large-scale missing domains. In this paper, guided by the connectivity principle of human visual perception, we introduce a nonlinear PDE inpainting model based upon curvature-driven diffusions for nontexture images. This third-order PDE model improves the second-order total variation inpainting model introduced earlier by Chan and Shen (SIAM J. Appl. Math., in press, 2001). Computational schemes and digital examples are given.","authors":["Tony F.
