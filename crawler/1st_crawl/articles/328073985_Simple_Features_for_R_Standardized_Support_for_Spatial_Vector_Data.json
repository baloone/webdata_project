{"id":"328073985_Simple_Features_for_R_Standardized_Support_for_Spatial_Vector_Data","abstract":"Simple features are a standardized way of encoding spatial vector data (points, lines, polygons) in computers. The sf package implements simple features in R, and has roughly the same capacity for spatial vector data as packages sp, rgeos, and rgdal. We describe the need for this package, its place in the R package ecosystem, and its potential to connect R to other computer systems. We illustrate this with examples of its use.","authors":["Edzer Pebesma"],"meta":["July 2018The R Journal 10(1):439-446","DOI:10.32614/RJ-2018-009"],"references":[]}
