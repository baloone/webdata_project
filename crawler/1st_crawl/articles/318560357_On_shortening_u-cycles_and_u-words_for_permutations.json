{"id":"318560357_On_shortening_u-cycles_and_u-words_for_permutations","abstract":"This paper initiates the study of shortening universal cycles (u-cycles) and universal words (u-words) for permutations either by using incomparable elements, or by using non-deterministic symbols. The latter approach is similar in nature to the recent relevant studies for the de Bruijn sequences. A particular result we obtain in this paper is that u-cycles for permutations of length $n$ exist of lengths $n!$, $n!-(n-1)$, $n!-2(n-1),\\ldots,n!-(n-1)!$.","authors":["Sergey Kitaev","Vladimir Potapov","Vincent Vajnovszki"],"meta":["July 2017Discrete Applied Mathematics 260","DOI:10.1016/j.dam.2019.01.025"],"references":["318896504_On_universal_partial_words","225726708_Optimal_sequences_of_trials_for_balancing_practice_and_repetition_effects","51784417_How_to_apply_de_Bruijn_graphs_to_genome_assembly","310235318_Universal_Partial_Words_over_Non-Binary_Alphabets","269020939_De_Bruijn_Sequences-A_Model_Example_of_the_Interaction_of_Discrete_Mathematics_and_Computer_Science","222561080_Optimised_De_Bruijn_patterns_for_one-shot_shape_acquisition","220192621_Universal_Cycles_for_Combinatorial_Structures","3299180_Determining_planar_location_via_complement-free_de_Brujin_sequences_using_discrete_optical_sensors"]}
