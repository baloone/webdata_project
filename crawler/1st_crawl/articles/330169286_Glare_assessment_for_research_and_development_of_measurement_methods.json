{"id":"330169286_Glare_assessment_for_research_and_development_of_measurement_methods","abstract":"Glare is one of the most important parameter of lighting quality. Despite the passage of time from the beginning of glare research, no standard of conducting laboratory experiments was proposed. In the article the review of solutions related to glare assessment is presented. The method of conducting research on glare is also described. The authors pay attention to the most important aspects in the methodology of glare assessment for the experimental research on glare and glare assessment based on UGR measurements. The tests of the new algorithm for UGR calculation is presented â€” algorithm for precise identification and extraction of glare source area from HDR image.","authors":["Dariusz Sawicki","Agnieszka Wolska","Tobias Porsch"],"meta":["January 2019Przeglad Elektrotechniczny 1(1):171-178","DOI:10.15199/48.2019.01.43"],"references":["337486460_A_PSYCHOPHYSICAL_MODEL_OF_DISCOMFORT_GLARE_IN_BOTH_OUTDOOR_AND_INDOOR_APPLICATIONS","325861251_An_Experimental_Study_on_the_Effect_of_Visual_Tasks_on_Discomfort_Due_to_Peripheral_Glare","323350484_Review_of_Factors_Influencing_Discomfort_Glare_Perception_from_Daylight","310496324_The_Unified_semantic_Glare_scale_for_GR_and_UGR_indexes","298455287_Algorithm_of_HDR_image_preparation_for_discomfort_glare_assessment","290184464_Glare_as_a_specific_factor_in_the_working_environment","316698164_High_Dynamic_Range_Imaging","311867398_Assessing_and_Modeling_Discomfort_Glare_for_Raw_White_LEDs_with_Different_Patterns","300364782_Assessing_glare_Part_2_Modifying_Unified_Glare_Rating_for_uniform_and_non-uniform_LED_luminaires","291113615_An_Experimental_Study_of_the_Glare_from_a_Luminous_Ceiling"]}
