{"id":"281352910_Smart_Materials_Based_Actuators_at_the_MicroNano-Scale_Characterization_Control_and_Applications","abstract":"Smart Materials-Based Actuators at the Micro/Nano-Scale: Characterization, Control, and Applications gives a state of the art of emerging techniques to the characterization and control of actuators based on smart materials working at the micro/nano scale. The book aims to characterize some commonly used structures based on piezoelectric and electroactive polymeric actuators and also focuses on various and emerging techniques employed to control them. This book also includes two of the most emerging topics and applications: nanorobotics and cells micro/nano-manipulation. Â© 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.
