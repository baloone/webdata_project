{"id":"267843247_Operations_for_Composing_Subsystems_in_the_Dataflow_Algebra","abstract":"This report builds on recent work that has developed basic structures for representing the concepts of systems and subsystems within the dataflow algebra, at both its topological and event layers of detail. This recent work has provided the mechanism for extracting from a specification of a complete system the specification of any subsystem of it, and this report extends this by developing the complementary operations that are needed to compose subsystem specifications, and in particular to compose the event layer specifications of their behaviour. For the operation of parallel composition this involves revising an earlier attempt at a formal definition, since it is shown that this did not actually provide a complete specification. This revised definition is then used to establish the properties of this operation that had been considered previously, namely identity, commutativity and associativity, and also to establish that this operation is substitutable. The report then goes on to define the synchronous merge operation, which previously had only been considered informally, and to establish its relationship with the parallel composition operation and its commutativity and associativity properties. Finally, these results are used to define a composition operation for subsystems, and to show that this too is commutative and associative.","authors":["A J Cowling"],"meta":[],"references":[]}
