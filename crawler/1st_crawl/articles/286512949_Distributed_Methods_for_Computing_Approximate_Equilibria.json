{"id":"286512949_Distributed_Methods_for_Computing_Approximate_Equilibria","abstract":"We present a new, distributed method to compute approximate Nash equilibria\nin bimatrix games. In contrast to previous approaches that analyze the two\npayoff matrices at the same time (for example, by solving a single LP that\ncombines the two players payoffs), our algorithm first solves two independent\nLPs, each of which is derived from one of the two payoff matrices, and then\ncompute approximate Nash equilibria using only limited communication between\nthe players.\nOur method has several applications for improved bounds for efficient\ncomputations of approximate Nash equilibria in bimatrix games. First, it yields\na best polynomial-time algorithm for computing \\emph{approximate well-supported\nNash equilibria (WSNE)}, which guarantees to find a 0.6528-WSNE in polynomial\ntime. Furthermore, since our algorithm solves the two LPs separately, it can be\nused to improve upon the best known algorithms in the limited communication\nsetting: the algorithm can be implemented to obtain a randomized\nexpected-polynomial-time algorithm that uses poly-logarithmic communication and\nfinds a 0.6528-WSNE. The algorithm can also be carried out to beat the best\nknown bound in the query complexity setting, requiring $O(n \\log n)$ payoff\nqueries to compute a 0.6528-WSNE. Finally, our approach can also be adapted to\nprovide the best known communication efficient algorithm for computing\n\\emph{approximate Nash equilibria}: it uses poly-logarithmic communication to\nfind a 0.382-approximate Nash equilibrium.","authors":["Artur Czumaj","Argyrios Deligkas","Michail Fasoulakis","John Fearnley"],"meta":["March 2019Algorithmica 81(1)","DOI:10.1007/s00453-018-0465-y","SourcearXiv"],"references":["266658384_Bounds_for_the_query_complexity_of_approximate_equilibria","235633972_On_the_Communication_Complexity_of_Approximate_Nash_Equilibria","345772508_Settling_the_Complexity_of_Computing_Approximate_Two-Player_Nash_Equilibria","317639481_Communication_complexity_of_approximate_Nash_equilibria","307444130_Finding_Approximate_Nash_Equilibria_of_Bimatrix_Games_via_Payoff_Queries","306398167_Communication_complexity_of_approximate_Nash_equilibria","303992881_Settling_the_complexity_of_computing_approximate_two-player_Nash_equilibria","272521652_An_Empirical_Study_of_Finding_Approximate_Equilibria_in_Bimatrix_Games","263891711_Approximate_Well-Supported_Nash_Equilibria_in_Symmetric_Bimatrix_Games","258106321_Finding_Approximate_Nash_Equilibria_of_Bimatrix_Games_via_Payoff_Queries"]}
