{"id":"259413067_A_note_on_the_triple_product_property_for_subsets_of_finite_groups","abstract":"The triple product property (TPP) for subsets of a finite group was introduced by Henry Cohn and Christopher Umans in 2003 as a tool for the study of the complexity of matrix multiplication. This note records some consequences of the simple observation that if ( S 1 , S 2 , S 3 ) is a TPP triple in a finite group G , then so is ( dS 1 a , dS 2 b , dS 3 c ) for any a , b , c , d ∈ G .\nLet s i :=∣ S i ∣ for 1≤ i ≤3. First we prove the inequality s 1 ( s 2 + s 3 −1)≤∣ G ∣ and show some of its uses. Then we show (something a little more general than) that if G has an abelian subgroup of index v , then s 1 s 2 s 3 ≤ v ² ∣ G ∣.","authors":["Peter M.
