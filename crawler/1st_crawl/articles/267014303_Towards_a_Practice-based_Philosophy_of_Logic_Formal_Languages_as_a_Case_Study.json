{"id":"267014303_Towards_a_Practice-based_Philosophy_of_Logic_Formal_Languages_as_a_Case_Study","abstract":"In different subfields of philosophy, focus on actual human practices has been an important (albeit still somewhat non-mainstream) approach in recent decades. But so far, no such practice-based turn has yet taken place within the philosophy of logic. In the first part of the paper, I delineate what a practice-based philosophy of logic would (could) look like, insisting in particular on why it can be relevant and how it is to be undertaken. In the second part, I illustrate the proposed practice-based approach by means of a case-study: the role played by formal languages in logic, in particular in the practices of logicians. I argue that formal languages play a fundamental operative role in the work of logicians, as a paper-and-pencil, hands-on technology triggering certain cognitive processes – more specifically, countering some of our more ‘spontaneous’ cognitive patterns which are not particularly suitable for research in logic (as well as in other fields). I substantiate these claims with empirical data from research in the psychology of reasoning. With this analysis, I hope to show that a practice-based philosophy of logic can be fruitful enterprise, in particular if accompanied by much-needed methodological reflection.","authors":["Catarina Dutilh Novaes"],"meta":["April 2012Philosophia Scientiae 1(1)","DOI:10.4000/philosophiascientiae.719"],"references":["226611372_The_Innateness_Hypothesis_and_Mathematical_Concepts","6261285_How_Abstract_Is_Symbolic_Thought","5585741_Formal_Notations_are_Diagrams_Evidence_from_a_Production_Task","344577838_Philosophy_of_Logics","321621358_18_Unconventional_Essays_on_the_Nature_of_Mathematics","282728561_Writing_notational_iconicity_calculus_On_writing_as_a_cultural_technique","266316652_Supersizing_The_Mind_Embodiment_Action_and_Cognitive_Extension","254428847_The_Fundamental_Computational_Biases_of_Human_Cognition_Heuristics_That_Sometimes_Impair_Decision_Making_and_Problem_Solving","254239409_The_Different_Ways_in_which_Logic_is_said_to_be_Formal","254224158_The_Effect_of_Belief_on_the_Spontaneous_Production_of_Syllogistic_Conclusions","248777979_Preface_The_Generosity_of_Formal_Languages","236767330_Writing_Notational_Iconicity_Calculus_On_Writing_as_a_Cultural_Technique_translation","233191975_Completeness_and_Categoricity_Part_I_Nineteenth-century_Axiomatics_to_Twentieth-century_Metalogic","232937582_Logic_and_Mathematics_in_the_Seventeenth_Century","227279057_Logic_as_Calculus_and_Logic_as_Language","225101239_Artificial_Languages_Across_Sciences_and_Civilizations","222582567_A_Little_Logic_Goes_a_Long_Way_Basing_Experiment_on_Semantic_Theory_in_the_Cognitive_Science_of_Conditional_Reasoning","222397090_Writing_as_Thinking","28762412_The_Extended_Mind","13603812_Understanding_of_logical_necessity_Developmental_antecedents_and_cognitive_consequences"]}
