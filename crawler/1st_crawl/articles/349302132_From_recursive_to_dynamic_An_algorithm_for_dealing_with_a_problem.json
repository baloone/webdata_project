{"id":"349302132_From_recursive_to_dynamic_An_algorithm_for_dealing_with_a_problem","abstract":"One of the problems in data science is related to data management, especially big data. It is indirectly related to algorithms in computer science. Therefore, the meeting between big data and the appropriate algorithm to produce a good output requires characterization and explanation. This paper reveals one of them, by involving the recursive and dynamic principles of programming, and by comparison giving choices as answers to problems.","authors":["Mahyuddin K. M.
