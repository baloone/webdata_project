{"id":"257514779_Global_view_on_reactivity_Switch_graphs_and_their_logics","abstract":"The notion of reactive graph generalises the one of graph by allowing the base accessibility relation to change when its edges are traversed. Can we represent these more general structures using points and arrows? We prove this can be done by introducing higher order arrows: the switches. The possibility of expressing the dependency of the future states of the accessibility relation on individual transitions by the use of higher-order relations, that is, coding meta-relational concepts by means of relations, strongly suggests the use of modal languages to reason directly about these structures. We introduce a hybrid modal logic for this purpose and prove its completeness.","authors":["Dov Gabbay","Sergio Marcelino"],"meta":["December 2012Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence 66(1-4)","DOI:10.1007/s10472-012-9316-8"],"references":["243768643_Logic_Engineering_The_Case_of_Description_and_Hybrid_Logics","227166174_Modal_logic_with_names","344486660_Modal_Logic","319964658_Introducing_reactive_kripke_semantics_and_arc_accessibility","312625141_Reactive_Kripke_semantics_and_arc_accessibility","251841758_Reactive_Kripke_Semantics_and_Arc_Accessibility","247035298_On_the_Development_of_Reactive_Systems","243766473_Many-Dimensional_Modal_Logics_Theory_and_Applications","229753839_An_approach_to_tense_logic1","226531915_Reactive_Intuitionistic_Tableaux"]}
