{"id":"351464877_Recursively_Divided_Pancake_Graphs_with_a_Small_Network_Cost","abstract":"Graphs are often used as models to solve problems in computer science, mathematics, and biology. A pancake sorting problem is modeled using a pancake graph whose classes include burnt pancake graphs, signed permutation graphs, and restricted pancake graphs. The network cost is degree × diameter. Finding a graph with a small network cost is like finding a good sorting algorithm. We propose a novel recursively divided pancake (RDP) graph that has a smaller network cost than other pancake-like graphs. In the pancake graph Pn, the number of nodes is n!, the degree is n − 1, and the network cost is O(n2). In an RDPn, the number of nodes is n!, the degree is 2log2n − 1, and the network cost is O(n(log2n)3). Because O(n(log2n)3) < O(n2), the RDP is superior to other pancake-like graphs. In this paper, we propose an RDPn and analyze its basic topological properties. Second, we show that the RDPn is recursive and symmetric. Third, a sorting algorithm is proposed, and the degree and diameter are derived. Finally, the network cost is compared between the RDP graph and other classes of pancake graphs.","authors":["Jung-Hyun Seo","Hyeong-Ok Lee"],"meta":["May 2021Symmetry 13(5):844","DOI:10.3390/sym13050844"],"references":["348254251_The_Construction_of_Multiple_Independent_Spanning_Trees_on_Burnt_Pancake_Networks","341148305_Constructing_dual-CISTs_of_pancake_graphs_and_performance_assessment_of_protection_routings_on_some_Cayley_networks","338619166_Design_and_analysis_of_the_rotational_binary_graph_as_an_alternative_to_hypercube_and_Torus","338179454_Constructing_Independent_Spanning_Trees_on_Pancake_Networks","342387705_Target_Set_Selection_on_generalized_pancake_graphs","323352200_The_h-extra_conditional_diagnosability_of_burnt_pancake_networks_under_the_PMC_model","282495919_An_algorithm_for_sorting_pancake_by_restricted_reversals","237054527_Bacterial_Computing_Using_E_coli_to_Solve_the_Burnt_Pancake_Problem","222708849_Advances_on_sorting_by_reversals","220770018_1375-Approximation_Algorithm_for_Sorting_by_Reversals","51888121_The_distribution_of_cycles_in_breakpoint_graphs_of_signed_permutations","220618108_Genome_Rearrangements_and_Sorting_by_Reversals","220406421_On_the_Diameter_of_the_Pancake_Network","220329229_A_Group-Theoretic_Model_for_Symmetric_Interconnection_Networks","220150921_An_upper_bound_for_sorting_by_prefix_reversals"]}
