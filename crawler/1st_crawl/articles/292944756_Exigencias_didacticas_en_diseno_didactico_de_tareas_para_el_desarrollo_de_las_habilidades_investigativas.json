{"id":"292944756_Exigencias_didacticas_en_diseno_didactico_de_tareas_para_el_desarrollo_de_las_habilidades_investigativas","abstract":"This paper addresses the formation of the research\ncompetence associated with the software industry from the University-Industry.\nDeficiency in the existing educational research in the area of teaching to address the\ndevelopment of research competence in students of careers related to computing in the\ndevelopment of industrial software is presented. To provide a solution to this educational\ndeficiency, a theoretical systematization of the formation of the research was\nperformed competition, didactic particularities industrial software development\nwas determined. Its presents, didactic requirements for industry professionals in\nthe instructional tasks design for the development of the research skill; actions to\ncontribute to its development from the University-Industry. It’s presents\nexploratory evaluations of 120 students and 40 industry professionals as the level of\nacceptance that students about his training in the industry, level of knowledge\nand skills in instructional design task by industry professionals, the level of\nacceptance about the proposal presented in this research, and the level of professional\ncommitment to student training. The development of this competence is determinate\nfor the different levels of communication that is evident in the industrial software.","authors":["Odiel Estrada Molina","Sahara María BLANCO HERNÁNDEZ","Febe Angel Ciudad Ricardo"],"meta":["December 2015Enseñanza & Teaching Revista Interuniversitaria de Didáctica 33(2):191","DOI:10.14201/et2015332191211","Project: Training tutors of the software development centers of the University of Informatics Science in consolidating the ability to model in software engineering"],"references":["329440312_La_formacion_basada_en_competencias_en_la_educacion_superior_el_enfoque_complejo","322900527_LA_FORMACION_POR_COMPETENCIAS_LABORALES_PROYECTO_DE_DISENO_CURRICULAR_PARA_EL_TECNICO_EN_FARMACIA_INDUSTRIAL","279540142_The_Interaction_of_Motivational_Orientation_and_Knowledge-Seeking_Inquiry_in_Computer-Supported_Collaborative_Learning","269046340_METHODOLOGICAL_BASIS_OF_DEVELOPMENT_OF_RESEARCH_COMPETENCE_OF_SECONDARY_SCHOOL_STUDENTS_IN_THE_NETWORK_RESEARCH_COMMUNITY","267710221_Evaluacion_de_competencias_investigativas","321084853_MODELO_PEDAGOGICO_PARA_EL_MEJORAMIENTO_DEL_DESEMPENO_PEDAGOGICO_PROFESIONAL_DE_LOS_PROFESORES_DE_AGRONOMIA_DE_LOS_INSTITUTOS_POLITECNICOS_AGROPECUARIOS","317519886_Metodologia_para_ubicar_estudiantes_en_roles_del_proceso_de_desarrollo_de_software","288285892_Training_of_roles_and_good_practice_for_quality_work_of_a_computer_engineer","285131351_Grade_4_students'_development_of_research_skills_through_inquiry-based_learning_projects","271237526_Scientific_Research_Competence_Two_Forms_of_Collegial_Judgment","267260991_Using_Action-Research_Strategies_and_Cohort_Structures_to_Ensure_Research_Competence_for_Practitioner-Scholar_Leaders","262449157_Competencias_y_educacion_superior","267697287_Procedimiento_para_la_conformacion_de_equipos_de_desarrollo_de_software_Autores","240249302_Software_Engineering_a_Practioner''s_approach","230873418_Software_Engineering"]}
