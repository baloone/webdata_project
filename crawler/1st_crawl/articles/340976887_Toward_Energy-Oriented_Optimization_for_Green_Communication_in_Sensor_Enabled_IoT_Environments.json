{"id":"340976887_Toward_Energy-Oriented_Optimization_for_Green_Communication_in_Sensor_Enabled_IoT_Environments","abstract":"One of the major bottlenecks toward realizing IoT systems is the energy constraint of sensors. Prolonging network lifetime is a fundamental issue for implementing IoT systems. The energy optimization problem, being NP-hard in nature for scalable networks, has been addressed in the literature using traditional metaheuristic techniques. Quantum inspired metaheuristics have shown better performance than their traditional counterparts in solving such optimization problems in different domains. Toward this end, this article proposes a quantum inspired green communication framework for Energy Balancing in sensor enabled IoT systems (Q-EBIoT). First, an energy optimization model for sensor enabled IoT environments is presented, where energy consumption is derived as cost of the energy-oriented paths. Second, a quantum computing oriented solution is developed for the optimization problem focusing on energy centric solution representation, measurement, and rotation angle. The proposed solution is implemented to evaluate the comparative performance with the state-of-the-art techniques. The evaluation demonstrates the benefit of the proposed framework in terms of various energy-related metrics for sensor enabled IoT environments.","authors":["Sushil Kumar","Omprakash Kaiwartya","Manisha Rathee","Neeraj Kumar"],"meta":["April 2020IEEE Systems Journal PP(99):1-11","DOI:10.1109/JSYST.2020.2975823"],"references":["322810676_Secure_Quantum_Steganography_Protocol_for_Fog_Cloud_Internet_of_Things","320255725_Towards_Green_Computing_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_Controlled_Mobility_aided_Balanced_Tree_Approach","319177882_Towards_the_Quantum_Internet_Generalised_Quantum_Network_Coding_for_Large-Scale_Quantum_Communication_Networks","318797858_Green_IoT_An_Investigation_on_Energy_Saving_Practices_for_2020_and_Beyond","317379718_Virtualization_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_Fault_Tolerant_Embedding_for_Internet_of_Things","313420967_Optimizing_Energy_Consumption_and_Inequality_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_using_NSGA-II","309035601_Green_computing_for_wireless_sensor_networks_Optimization_and_Huffman_coding_approach","323373005_A_Future_with_Quantum_Machine_Learning","322140788_Towards_Green_Computing_for_Internet_of_Things_Energy_Oriented_Path_and_Message_Scheduling_Approach","317324619_A_Fuzzy_Logic_Approach_by_Using_Particle_Swarm_Optimization_for_Effective_Energy_Management_in_IWSNs"]}
