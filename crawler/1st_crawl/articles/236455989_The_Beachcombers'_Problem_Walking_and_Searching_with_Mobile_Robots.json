{"id":"236455989_The_Beachcombers'_Problem_Walking_and_Searching_with_Mobile_Robots","abstract":"We introduce and study a new problem concerning the exploration of a\ngeometric domain by mobile robots. Consider a line segment $[0,I]$ and a set of\n$n$ mobile robots $r_1,r_2,..., r_n$ placed at one of its endpoints. Each robot\nhas a {\\em searching speed} $s_i$ and a {\\em walking speed} $w_i$, where $s_i\n<w_i$. We assume that each robot is aware of the number of robots of the\ncollection and their corresponding speeds. At each time moment a robot $r_i$\neither walks along a portion of the segment not exceeding its walking speed\n$w_i$ or searches a portion of the segment with the speed not exceeding $s_i$.\nA search of segment $[0,I]$ is completed at the time when each of its points\nhave been searched by at least one of the $n$ robots. We want to develop {\\em\nmobility schedules} (algorithms) for the robots which complete the search of\nthe segment as fast as possible. More exactly we want to maximize the {\\em\nspeed} of the mobility schedule (equal to the ratio of the segment length\nversus the time of the completion of the schedule).\nWe analyze first the offline scenario when the robots know the length of the\nsegment that is to be searched. We give an algorithm producing a mobility\nschedule for arbitrary walking and searching speeds and prove its optimality.\nThen we propose an online algorithm, when the robots do not know in advance the\nactual length of the segment to be searched. The speed $S$ of such algorithm is\ndefined as $S = \\inf_{I_L} S(I_L)$ where $S(I_L)$ denotes the speed of\nsearching of segment $I_L=[0,L]$. We prove that the proposed online algorithm\nis 2-competitive. The competitive ratio is shown to be better in the case when\nthe robots' walking speeds are all the same.","authors":["Jurek Czyzowicz","Leszek Gasieniec","Konstantinos Georgiou","Evangelos Kranakis"],"meta":["April 2013Theoretical Computer Science 608","DOI:10.1016/j.tcs.2015.09.011","SourcearXiv"],"references":["262353024_Fast_Collaborative_Graph_Exploration","227296332_Competitive_Online_Approximation_of_the_Optimal_Search_Ratio","225802316_Boundary_Patrolling_by_Mobile_Agents_with_Distinct_Maximal_Speeds","224934338_Collaborative_Search_on_the_Plane_without_Communication","220752868_Network_Exploration_by_Silent_and_Oblivious_Robots","220617164_Competitive_Online_Approximation_of_the_Optimal_Search_Ratio","220430785_How_to_Learn_an_Unknown_Environment_I_The_Rectilinear_Case","30529942_The_Theory_of_Search_Games_and_Rendezvous","313502462_Online_graph_exploration_algorithms_for_cycles_and_trees_by_multiple_searchers","293553875_Competitive_algorithms_for_layered_graph_traversal","290882735_Online_Algorithms_-_What_Is_It_Worth_to_Know_the_Future","284342297_Somatic_embryogenesis_and_plant_regeneration_from_cotyledons_of_immature_embryo_of_chinese_jujube_Zizyphus_jujuba_Mill","275064283_An_Optimal_Search","257285777_Searching_in_the_Plane","244438480_Presentation_of_a_Maze-Solving_Machine","232650153_Exploring_an_unknown_graph_PDF","225363679_On_the_Linear_Search_Problem","223206196_Map_construction_of_unknown_graphs_by_multiple_agents","222678896_Online_Searching_with_Turn_Cost","222539031_An_annotated_bibliography_on_guaranteed_graph_searching","222462918_Shortest_Paths_Without_a_Map","221498607_How_to_Learn_an_Unknown_Environment_Extended_Abstract","221220045_Multi-target_Ray_Searching_Problems","221025440_On-line_Searching_and_Navigation","220589432_Online_algorithms_A_survey","220247476_Searching_in_the_Plane","220209096_Collective_tree_exploration","47648662_On_Utilizing_Speed_in_Networks_of_Mobile_Agents","45893507_Optimal_Exploration_of_Terrains_with_Obstacles","4181816_Optimizing_sensor_movement_planning_for_energy_efficiency","3505526_Exploring_an_unknown_graph","2456737_Searching_in_an_Unknown_Environment_An_Optimal_Randomized_Algorithm_for_the_Cow-Path_Problem","2237117_Exploring_Unknown_Environments"]}
