{"id":"267705862_An_Overview_of_Computer_Programming_Teaching_Methods","abstract":"This paper researches different com-puter programming teaching methods in courses in higher education. Computer programming is among the most challenging subjects in com-puter science curriculum, and the one that many students find difficult to grasp, hence it is very important to select an appropriate teaching strategy that will provide students with the most efficient learning environment. The paper gives an overview and comparison of some of the existing teaching methods and addresses the benefits and problems associated with their application.","authors":["Sanja Mohorovicic","Vedran Strčić"],"meta":[],"references":["250888553_PBL_and_Computer_Programming_---_The_Seven_Steps_Method_with_Adaptations","228955901_ICT_teaching_methods-Programming_languages","224930648_New_Approaches_and_Tools_in_Teaching_Programming","224170492_Game-Themed_Programming_Assignment_Modules_A_Pathway_for_Gradual_Integration_of_Gaming_Context_Into_Existing_Introductory_Programming_Courses","224098521_An_Empirical_Evaluation_of_Puzzle-Based_Learning_as_an_Interest_Approach_for_Teaching_Introductory_Computer_Science","221496223_Programming_as_an_Experience_The_Inspiration_for_Self","220590581_On_the_Development_of_a_Programming_Teaching_Tool_The_Effect_of_Teaching_by_Templates_on_the_Learning_Process","26849635_Evaluating_the_Effects_of_Virtual_Pair_Programming_on_Students'_Achievement_and_Satisfaction","253290049_Applying_a_hybrid_problem-based_learning_method_to_the_teaching_of_computer_programming","228883626_Factors_affecting_the_perceived_effectiveness_of_pair_programming_in_higher_education","228465660_On_the_difficulty_of_learning_to_program","224138139_Measuring_the_Effects_of_Virtual_Pair_Programming_in_an_Introductory_Programming_Java_Course","224130233_Puzzle-Based_Learning_for_Engineering_and_Computer_Science","221537779_A_top-down_approach_to_teaching_programming"]}
