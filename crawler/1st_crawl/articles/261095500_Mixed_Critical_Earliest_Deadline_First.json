{"id":"261095500_Mixed_Critical_Earliest_Deadline_First","abstract":"Using the advances of the modern microelectronics technology, the safety-critical systems, such as avionics, can reduce their costs by integrating multiple tasks on one device. This makes such systems essentially mixed-critical, as this brings together different tasks whose safety assurance requirements may differ significantly. In the context of mixed-critical scheduling theory, we studied the dual criticality problem of scheduling a finite set of hard real-time jobs. In this work we propose an algorithm which is proved to dominate OCBP, a state-of-the art algorithm for this problem that is optimal over fixed job priority algorithms. We show through empirical studies that our algorithm can reduce the set of non-schedulable instances by a factor of two or, under certain assumptions, by a factor of four, when compared to OCBP.","authors":["Dario Socci","Peter Poplavko","Saddek Bensalem","Marius Bozga"],"meta":["July 2013Proceedings - Euromicro Conference on Real-Time Systems","DOI:10.1109/ECRTS.2013.20","Conference: Real-Time Systems (ECRTS), 2013 25th Euromicro Conference on"],"references":["261450103_The_Preemptive_Uniprocessor_Scheduling_of_Mixed-Criticality_Implicit-Deadline_Sporadic_Task_Systems","225719183_Scheduling_Real-Time_Mixed-Criticality_Jobs","261450102_Outstanding_Paper_Award_Bounding_and_Shaping_the_Demand_of_Mixed-Criticality_Sporadic_Tasks","247442902_Introduction_To_Algorithms","243752797_Flexible_Scheduling_in_Hard_Real-Time_Systems","221298565_On_the_Scheduling_of_Mixed-Criticality_Real-Time_Task_Sets","221298432_Effective_and_Efficient_Scheduling_of_Certifiable_Mixed-Criticality_Sporadic_Task_Systems","221298328_Certification-Cognizant_Time-Triggered_Scheduling_of_Mixed-Criticality_Systems","221193836_Mixed-Criticality_Real-Time_Scheduling_for_Multicore_Systems","220800863_Dynamic_scheduling_algorithm_and_its_schedulability_analysis_for_certifiable_dual-criticality_systems","220800766_Load-based_schedulability_analysis_of_certifiable_mixed-criticality_systems","220692549_Introduction_to_Algorithms_3_ed","220431427_Scheduling_Algorithms_for_Multiprogramming_in_Hard-Real-Time_Environment","220266985_Towards_the_Design_of_Certifiable_Mixed-criticality_Systems","4301496_Preemptive_Scheduling_of_Multi-criticality_Systems_with_Varying_Degrees_of_Execution_Time_Assurance"]}
