A representative method of numerical wind tunnel simulation technology: large eddy simulation method was introduced. One of the key technology of it called Inflow turbulence generation method was also analyzed. Meanwhile, three inflow turbulence generation methods were compared. It can provide reference for the further research on numerical wind tunnel simulation.","authors":["Zhuangnan Zhang","Xiaochun Bao"],"meta":["April 2019IOP Conference Series Materials Science and Engineering 490(3):032015","DOI:10.1088/1757-899X/490/3/032015"],"references":["318787719_Research_on_generating_method_of_fluctuating_wind_field_of_LES_based_on_WAWS","309562792_General_Circulation_Experiments_with_the_Primitive_Equations","276299319_Inflow_Turbulence_Generation_Methods_with_Large_Eddy_Simulation_for_Wind_Effects_on_Tall_Buildings","253305814_Diffusion_by_a_Random_Velocity_Field","230606420_A_general_inflow_turbulence_generator_for_large_eddy_simulation"]}
