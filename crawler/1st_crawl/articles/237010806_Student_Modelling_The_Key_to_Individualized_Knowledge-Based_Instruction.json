{"id":"237010806_Student_Modelling_The_Key_to_Individualized_Knowledge-Based_Instruction","abstract":"This book is the result of a NATO sponsored workshop entitled \"Student Modelling: The Key to Individualized Knowledge-Based Instruction\" which was held May 4-8, 1991 at Ste. Adele, Quebec, Canada. The workshop was co-directed by Gordon McCalla and Jim Greer of the ARIES Laboratory at the University of Saskatchewan. The workshop focused on the problem of student modelling in intelligent tutoring systems. An intelligent tutoring system (ITS) is a computer program that is aimed at providing knowledgeable, individualized instruction in a one-on-one interaction with a learner. In order to individualize this interaction, the ITS must keep track of many aspects of the leamer: how much and what he or she has leamed to date; what leaming styles seem to be successful for the student and what seem to be less successful; what deeper mental models the student may have; motivational and affective dimensions impacting the leamer; and so ono Student modelling is the problem of keeping track of alI of these aspects of a leamer's leaming.","authors":["Jim E Greer","Gordon I McCalla"],"meta":["January 1994","DOI:10.1007/978-3-662-03037-0","Publisher: NY: Springer-VerlagISBN: 978-3-642-08186-6"],"references":[]}
