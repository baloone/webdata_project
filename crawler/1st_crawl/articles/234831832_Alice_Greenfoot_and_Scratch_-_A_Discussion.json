{"id":"234831832_Alice_Greenfoot_and_Scratch_-_A_Discussion","abstract":"This article distills a discussion about the goals, mechanisms, and effects of three environments which aim to support the acquisition and development of computing concepts (problem solving and programming) in pre-University and non-technical students: Alice, Greenfoot, and Scratch. The conversation started in a special session on the topic at the 2010 ACM SIGCSE Symposium on Computer Science Education and continued during the creation of the resulting Special Issue of the ACM Transactions on Computing Education.","authors":["Ian Utting","Stephen Cooper","Michael KÃ¶lling","John Maloney"],"meta":["November 2010ACM Transactions on Computing Education 10(4):17","DOI:10.1145/1868358.1868364","Sourcedx.doi.org"],"references":["221538836_Comparing_Alice_Greenfoot_Scratch","38413358_Scratch_for_Budding_Computer_Scientists","234794185_Teaching_computer_science_in_context"]}
