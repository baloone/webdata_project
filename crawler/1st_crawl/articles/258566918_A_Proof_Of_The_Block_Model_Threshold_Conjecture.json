{"id":"258566918_A_Proof_Of_The_Block_Model_Threshold_Conjecture","abstract":"We study a random graph model named the ``block model'' in statistics and the\n``planted partition model'' in theoretical computer science. In its simplest\nform, this is a random graph with two equal-sized clusters, with a\nbetween-class edge probability of $q$ and a within-class edge probability of\n$p$.\nA striking conjecture of Decelle, Krzkala, Moore and Zdeborov\\'a based on\ndeep, non-rigorous ideas from statistical physics, gave a precise prediction\nfor the algorithmic threshold of clustering in the sparse planted partition\nmodel. In particular, if $p = a/n$ and $q = b/n$, $s=(a-b)/2$ and $p=(a+b)/2$\nthen Decelle et al.\\ conjectured that it is possible to efficiently cluster in\na way correlated with the true partition if $s^2 > p$ and impossible if $s^2 <\np$. By comparison, the best-known rigorous result is that of Coja-Oghlan, who\nshowed that clustering is possible if $s^2 > C p \\ln p$ for some sufficiently\nlarge $C$.\nIn a previous work, we proved that indeed it is information theoretically\nimpossible to to cluster if $s^2 < p$ and furthermore it is information\ntheoretically impossible to even estimate the model parameters from the graph\nwhen $s^2 < p$. Here we complete the proof of the conjecture by providing an\nefficient algorithm for clustering in a way that is correlated with the true\npartition when $s^2 > p$. A different independent proof of the same result was\nrecently obtained by Laurent Massoulie.","authors":["Elchanan Mossel","Joe Neeman","Allan Sly"],"meta":["November 2013Combinatorica 38(3)","DOI:10.1007/s00493-016-3238-8","SourcearXiv"],"references":["304856768_High_Degree_Vertices_and_Eigenvalues_in_the_Preferential_Attachment_Graph","268525693_Community_detection_in_sparse_networks_via_Grothendieck's_inequality","260193637_Community_Detection_via_Random_and_Adaptive_Sampling","258924057_Spectral_Redemption_in_Clustering_Sparse_Networks","258442326_Community_detection_thresholds_and_the_weak_Ramanujan_property","228057669_Eigenvalues_and_Graph_Bisection_an_Average_Case_Analysis","227334923_Estimation_and_Prediction_for_Stochastic_Blockmodels_for_Graphs_with_Latent_Block_Structure","221804803_Asymptotic_analysis_of_the_stochastic_block_model_for_modular_networks_and_its_algorithmic_applications","45928502_Spectral_clustering_and_the_high-dimensional_stochastic_blockmodel","4355179_Eigenvalues_and_Graph_Bisection_An_Average-Case_analysis","1761185_Random_Matrices_The_circular_Law","314808672_Binomial_approximation_to_the_Poisson_binomial_distribution_The_Krawtchouk_expansion","256512934_The_solution_of_some_random_NP-hard_problems_in_polynomial_expected_time","252421438_Spectral_Statistics_of_ErdH_osR'enyi_Graphs_II_Eigenvalue_Spacing_and_the_Extreme_Eigenvalues","247650049_Stochastic_Blockmodels_First_Steps","242076542_Binomial_Approximation_to_the_Poisson_Binomial_Distribution_The_Krawtchouk_Expansion","237128657_Graph_bisection_algorithms_with_good_average_behaviour","225288846_Graph_Spectra_and_the_Detectability_of_Community_Structure_in_Networks","221498587_Graph_Bisection_Algorithms_with_Good_Average_Case_Behavior","220568034_The_Metropolis_Algorithm_for_Graph_Bisection","220357548_Graph_Partitioning_via_Adaptive_Spectral_Techniques","220138965_Graph_partitioning_via_adaptive_spectral_techniques","200110480_Statistical_properties_of_community_structure_in_large_social_and_information_networks","47373305_Universality_and_the_circular_law_for_sparse_random_matrices","44489580_Branching_processes_by_K_B_Athreya_and_P_E_Ney","40027400_A_nonparametric_view_of_network_models_and_Newman-Girvan_and_other_modularities","38365393_Additional_Limit_Theorems_for_Indecomposable_Multidimensional_Galton-Watson_Processes","37811236_Exploring_Complex_Networks","12075011_Strogatz_SH_Exploring_Complex_Networks_Nature_410_268","3921094_Spectral_Partitioning_of_Random_Graphs","2898222_Spectral_Techniques_Applied_to_Sparse_Random_Graphs","2386539_Algorithms_for_Graph_Partitioning_on_the_Planted_Partition_Model"]}
