{"id":"303882160_Investigation_on_Subjetive_HRTF_Rating_Repeatability","abstract":"This paper investigates the repeatability of an HRTF evaluation protocol, assessing the spatial quality of binaural stimuli, moving along pre-defined trajectories on the horizontal and median planes, on a forced-choice 9-point rating scale. The protocol assessment was based on data simulations and subjective studies. Repeatability was evaluated as a function of the size and content of the HRTF corpus, the trajectories, and the resolution of the rating scale. Analysis of the data revealed that HRTF rating is a reliable, yet, challenging task with low repeatability rates of â‰ˆ 50%. Therefore participant screening through pre-tests should be used to maximize reliability of the responses.","authors":["Areti Andreopoulou","Brian F G Katz"],"meta":["June 2016","Conference: 140th Audio Engineering Society ConventionAt: Paris, France"],"references":["315812259_Measurement_of_a_head-related_transfer_function_database_with_high_spatial_resolution","280565754_ON_THE_USE_OF_SUBJECTIVE_HRTF_EVALUATIONS_FOR_CREATING_GLOBAL_PERCEPTUAL_SIMILARITY_METRICS_OF_ASSESSORS_AND_ASSESSEES","262008560_Reaching_to_Sound_Accuracy_in_the_Peri-personal_Space_of_Blind_and_Sighted_Humans","236213262_Variability_in_Perceptual_Evaluation_of_HRTFs","228637855_Individualization_of_head-related_transfer_functions_with_tournament-style_listening_test_Listening_with_other's_ears","298718854_Subjective_HRTF_evaluations_for_obtaining_global_similarity_metrics_of_assessors_and_assessees","287088572_Stimulus-dependent_HRTF_preference","265413992_scshape_listen_hrtf_database","262928627_A_comparative_study_of_Interaural_Time_Delay_estimation_methods","228944321_Selection_and_Tuning_of_HRTFs"]}
