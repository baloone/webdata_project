{"id":"221097005_Innovative_User_Interfaces_for_Wearable_Computers_in_Real_Augmented_Environment","abstract":"To be able to move freely in an environment, the user needs a wearable configuration that is composed of a set of interaction\ndevices, which allows the interaction at least one hand free. Taking into account the location (physical, geographical or\nlogical) and the aimed activities of the user, the interaction style and devices must be in appropriate relation with the\ncontext. In this paper, we present our design approach and a series of real proposals of wearable user interfaces. Our research\nis investigating innovative environment dependent and environment independent interfaces. We describe these interfaces, their\nconfigurations, real examples of use and the evaluation of selected techniques.","authors":["Yun Zhou","Bertrand David","Ren√© Chalon"],"meta":["July 2011","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-21605-3_55","SourceDBLP","Conference: Human-Computer Interaction.
