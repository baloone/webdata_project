{"id":"305952753_The_Metric_Dimension_of_Some_Kneser_Graphs","abstract":"The Kneser graph KG(n, k) is the graph whose vertex set consists of all k-subsets of an n-set, and two vertices are adjacent if and only if they are disjoint. The metric dimension β(G) of a graph G is the minimum cardinality of a resolving set for G. With the aid of computer search, we obtain bounds for the metric dimension of some Kneser graphs KG(n, k). We show that β(KG(n, 2)) = n − 2 for 5 ≤ n ≥ 11, β(KG(7, 3)) = 5, 11 ≤ β(KG(8, 3)) ≤ 12, β(KG(9, 3)) ≤ 18, β(KG(9, 4)) ≤ 6, β(KG(10, 3)) ≤ 25, β(KG(10, 4)) ≤ 23, β(KG(11, 3)) ≤ 41, β(KG(11, 4)) ≤ 119, and β(KG(11, 5)) ≤ 8.","authors":["Peng Hui","Wang Xunting","Wang Jing","Chen Siyuan"],"meta":["May 2016Journal of Computational and Theoretical Nanoscience 13(5):3013-3018","DOI:10.1166/jctn.2016.4951"],"references":[]}
