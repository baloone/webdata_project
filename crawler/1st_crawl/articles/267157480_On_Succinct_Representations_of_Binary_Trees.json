{"id":"267157480_On_Succinct_Representations_of_Binary_Trees","abstract":"We observe that a standard transformation between \\emph{ordinal} trees\n(arbitrary rooted trees with ordered children) and binary trees leads to\ninteresting succinct binary tree representations. There are four symmetric\nversions of these transformations. Via these transformations we get four\nsuccinct representations of $n$-node binary trees that use $2n + n/(\\log\nn)^{O(1)}$ bits and support (among other operations) navigation, inorder\nnumbering, one of pre- or post-order numbering, subtree size and lowest common\nancestor (LCA) queries. The ability to support inorder numbering is crucial for\nthe well-known range-minimum query (RMQ) problem on an array $A$ of $n$ ordered\nvalues. While this functionality, and more, is also supported in $O(1)$ time\nusing $2n + o(n)$ bits by Davoodi et al.'s (\\emph{Phil. Trans. Royal Soc. A}\n\\textbf{372} (2014)) extension of a representation by Farzan and Munro\n(\\emph{Algorithmica} \\textbf{6} (2014)), their \\emph{redundancy}, or the $o(n)$\nterm, is much larger, and their approach may not be suitable for practical\nimplementations.\nOne of these transformations is related to the Zaks' sequence (S.~Zaks,\n\\emph{Theor. Comput. Sci.} \\textbf{10} (1980)) for encoding binary trees, and\nwe thus provide the first succinct binary tree representation based on Zaks'\nsequence. Another of these transformations is equivalent to Fischer and Heun's\n(\\emph{SIAM J. Comput.} \\textbf{40} (2011)) \\minheap\\ structure for this\nproblem. Yet another variant allows an encoding of the Cartesian tree of $A$ to\nbe constructed from $A$ using only $O(\\sqrt{n} \\log n)$ bits of working space.","authors":["Pooya Davoodi","Rajeev Raman","Srinivasa Rao Satti"],"meta":["June 2017Mathematics in Computer Science 11(1)","DOI:10.1007/s11786-017-0294-4","SourcearXiv"],"references":["256555044_Lexicographic_generation_of_ordered_trees","226524011_A_Simple_Optimal_Representation_for_Balanced_Parentheses","299005389_Succinct_representation_of_balanced_parentheses_and_static_trees","289822829_Design_of_Practical_Succinct_Data_Structures_for_Large_Data_Collections","266064772_Succinct_Representations_of_Ordinal_Trees","261769809_Encoding_range_minima_and_range_top-2_queries","258279066_From_Theory_to_Practice_Plug_and_Play_with_Succinct_Data_Structures","242104237_Succinct_Representation_of_Balanced_Parentheses_and_Static_Trees","224354132_Succincter","222516401_Replacing_Suffix_Trees_with_Enhanced_Suffix_Arrays"]}
