{"id":"263813673_A_Review_On_Multi-Label_Learning_Algorithms","abstract":"Multi-label learning studies the problem where each example is represented by a single instance while associated with a set of labels simultaneously. During the past decade, significant amount of progresses have been made toward this emerging machine learning paradigm. This paper aims to provide a timely review on this area with emphasis on state-of-the-art multi-label learning algorithms. Firstly, fundamentals on multi-label learning including formal definition and evaluation metrics are given. Secondly and primarily, eight representative multi-label learning algorithms are scrutinized under common notations with relevant analyses and discussions. Thirdly, several related learning settings are briefly summarized. As a conclusion, online resources and open research problems on multi-label learning are outlined for reference purposes.","authors":["Min-Ling Zhang","Zhi-Hua Zhou"],"meta":["August 2014IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering 26(8):1819-1837","DOI:10.1109/TKDE.2013.39"],"references":["313656130_Correlation-based_pruning_of_stacked_binary_relevance_models_for_multi-label_learning","288623967_Multilabel_classification_of_music_into_emotions","313558756_Maximal_margin_labeling_for_multi-topic_text_categorization","312712778_Multi-label_multiple_kernel_learning","309476423_Multi-label_learning_by_exploiting_label_correlations_locally","307881957_LIBSVM_A_library_for_support_vector_machines","306157345_Submodular_Multi-Label_Learning","302365878_Combining_Instance-Based_Learning_and_Logistic_Regression_for_Multilabel_Classification","298606994_Ensemble_methods_in_machine_learning","289689686_A_ranking-based_KNN_approach_for_multi-label_classification"]}
