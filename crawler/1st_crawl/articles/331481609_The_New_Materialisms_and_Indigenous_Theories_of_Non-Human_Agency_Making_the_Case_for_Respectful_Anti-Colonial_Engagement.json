{"id":"331481609_The_New_Materialisms_and_Indigenous_Theories_of_Non-Human_Agency_Making_the_Case_for_Respectful_Anti-Colonial_Engagement","abstract":"Abstract\nBoth new materialist philosophy of science and Indigenous studies scholarship have developed theories about the\nagency of non-human things. There has, however, been relatively little articulation between these two literatures in the\nqualitative social sciences. This essay looks at the possible reasons for this lack of engagement–including the relatively\nrecent emergence of new materialism, pervasive racism within the academy, and foundational differences in the priorities\nand philosophical assumptions informing these two literatures. Addressing new materialist scholars, the essay inventories\nthe ethical, political, and intellectual reasons social scientists using Karen Barad’s concept of agential realism should also be\nreading and citing Indigenous studies literature on agent ontologies. It makes the case that the Indigenous studies literature\non agent ontologies have strengths in precisely some of the places new materialist social science is facing challenges.\nExamples are provided and the broader political implications of such work are examined.","authors":["Jerry Rosiek","Scott L.
