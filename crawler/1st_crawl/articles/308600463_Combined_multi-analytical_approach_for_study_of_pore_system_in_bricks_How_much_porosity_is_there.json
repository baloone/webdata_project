{"id":"308600463_Combined_multi-analytical_approach_for_study_of_pore_system_in_bricks_How_much_porosity_is_there","abstract":"During the firing of bricks, mineralogical and textural transformations produce an artificial aggregate characterised by significant porosity. Particularly as regards pore-size distribution and the interconnection model, porosity is an important parameter to evaluate and predict the durability of bricks. The pore system is in fact the main element, which correlates building materials and their environment (especially in cases of aggressive weathering, e.g., salt crystallisation and freeze-thaw cycles) and determines their durability. Four industrial bricks with differing compositions and firing temperatures were analysed with ?direct? and ?indirect? techniques, traditional methods (mercury intrusion porosimetry, hydric tests, nitrogen adsorption) and new analytical approaches based on digital image reconstruction of 2D and 3D models (back-scattered electrons and computerised X-ray micro-Tomography). The comparison of results from different analytical methods in the ?overlapping ranges? of porosity and the careful reconstruction of a cumulative curve, allowed overcoming their specific limitations and achieving better knowledge of the pore system of bricks.","authors":["Chiara Coletti","Giuseppe Cultrone","Lara Maritan","Claudio Mazzoli"],"meta":["September 2016Materials Characterization
