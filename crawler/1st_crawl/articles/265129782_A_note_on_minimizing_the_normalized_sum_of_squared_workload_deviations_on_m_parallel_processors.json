{"id":"265129782_A_note_on_minimizing_the_normalized_sum_of_squared_workload_deviations_on_m_parallel_processors","abstract":"In this note we provide a counter-example to a central result by Ho, Tseng, Ruiz-Torres, and López (2009) who proved that a schedule which minimizes the normalized sum of squared workload deviations is necessarily a makespan-optimal one. We explain why their proof is incorrect and present some computational results revealing the difference between workload balancing and makespan minimization.","authors":["Rico Walter","Alexander Lawrinenko"],"meta":["September 2014Computers & Industrial Engineering 75(1):257–259","DOI:10.1016/j.cie.2014.07.004"],"references":["222029329_Minimizing_the_normalized_sum_of_square_for_workload_deviations_on_m_parallel_processors","220695890_Computers_and_Intracdtability_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness","220471175_A_new_heuristic_for_workload_balancing_on_identical_parallel_machines_and_a_statistical_perspective_on_the_workload_balancing_criteria"]}
