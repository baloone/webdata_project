{"id":"319389252_Design_for_experience_innovation_understanding_user_experience_in_new_product_development","abstract":"In providing a better experience to users in terms of product usage, we focus on the important concept of a user-centred design (UCD), and explore a new approach to user experience (UX), with the effort to understand experience-driven innovation. Based on the conceptual framework of experiential network and the results of multiple case studies covering 643 successfully designed products or services providing an optimised UX, we categorise the UX context into the following four representative types: individualisation, combination, integration, and ecosystem. Furthermore, we identify the essential UCD concepts that reflect the core needs and expectations of users in each of the designed contexts, that is, specialty, usefulness, usability, and fluency. Finally, we discuss the dynamic concepts that help achieve a successful experience innovation. We expect these findings to play a crucial role in the development of novel design concepts or strategies, not only to better understand the needs of contemporary users, but also to better understand the dynamics of innovation.","authors":["Youngsoo Shin","Chaerin Im","Hyosun Oh","Jinwoo Kim"],"meta":["August 2017Behaviour and Information Technology 36(4):1-15","DOI:10.1080/0144929X.2017.1368709","Project: Yonsei University Future-leading Research"],"references":["269337049_Organizing_for_Innovation_in_the_Digitized_World","264595739_Incremental_and_Radical_Innovation_Design_Research_vs_Technology_and_Meaning_Change","262282923_Organizing_for_Innovation_in_the_Digitized_World","255677522_UCPCD_user-centered_product_concept_design","250890525_Direct_Manipulation_Interfaces","237089904_Case_Study_Methodology_as_a_Means_of_Theory_Building_Performance_Measurement_in_Facilities_Management_Organisations","233864602_User_experience_-_A_research_agenda","222571757_The_Internet_of_Things_A_Survey","222525058_How_User_Innovations_Become_Commercial_Products_A_Theoretical_Investigation_and_Case_Study","221518375_Understanding_scoping_and_defining_user_experience_A_survey_approach","220613137_Information_technology_fluency_in_practice","200465578_Architectural_Innovation_The_Reconfiguration_of_Existing_Product_Technologies_and_the_Failure_of_Established_Firms","43642930_User_Interface_Design_and_Evaluation","4261938_The_Service_Ecosystem_Dynamic_Self-Aggregation_of_Pervasive_Communication_Services","321215903_Designing_for_Situation_Awareness_An_Approach_to_User-Centered_Design_Second_Edition","312985464_Building_theories_from_case_study_research","311469139_Information_technology_fluency_in_practice","290938078_Architectural_innovation_The_reconfiguration_of_existing_product_technologies_and_the_failure_of_established_firms","284679162_Business_Intelligence_and_Analytics_From_Big_Data_to_Big_Impact","281059411_User_experience","276442290_Defining_user_experience_goals_to_guide_the_design_of_industrial_systems","263893805_Applying_user_centred_and_participatory_design_approaches_to_commercial_product_development","259823111_The_Elements_of_User_Experience_User-Centered_Design_for_the_Web_and_Beyond","259173905_Social_Network_Analysis","258188510_Social_Network_Analysis","242569642_The_Discovery_of_Grounded_Theory_Strategies_for_Qualitative_Research","238698741_Participatory_Design_Principles_and_Practices","235700925_Creating_Breakthrough_Products_Innovation_from_Product_Planning_to_Program_Approval","229324447_Personas_and_user-centered_design_How_can_personas_benefit_product_design_processes","229068043_Contextual_design_defining_customer_centred_systems","224952183_Building_Theory_From_Case_Study_Research","224149514_What_Factors_Contributed_to_the_Success_of_Apple's_iPhone","221094999_User_Experience_Quality_A_Conceptual_Framework_for_Goal_Setting_and_Measurement","216634004_Social_Network_Analysis_Methods_And_Applications","200465328_Case_Study_Research_Design_Methods","39318266_The_New_Frontier_of_Experience_Innovation","30873101_The_Logic_of_Architecture_Design_Computation_and_Cognition","6616249_Disruptive_Innovation_for_Social_Change"]}
