{"id":"327370201_Brain_Tumor_Segmentation_and_Radiomics_Survival_Prediction_Contribution_to_the_BRATS_2017_Challenge","abstract":"Quantitative analysis of brain tumors is critical for clinical decision making. While manual segmentation is tedious, time consuming and subjective, this task is at the same time very challenging to solve for automatic segmentation methods. In this paper we present our most recent effort on developing a robust segmentation algorithm in the form of a convolutional neural network. Our network architecture was inspired by the popular U-Net and has been carefully modified to maximize brain tumor segmentation performance. We use a dice loss function to cope with class imbalances and use extensive data augmentation to successfully prevent overfitting. Our method beats the current state of the art on BraTS 2015, is one of the leading methods on the BraTS 2017 validation set (dice scores of 0.896, 0.797 and 0.732 for whole tumor, tumor core and enhancing tumor, respectively) and achieves very good Dice scores on the test set (0.858 for whole, 0.775 for core and 0.647 for enhancing tumor). We furthermore take part in the survival prediction subchallenge by training an ensemble of a random forest regressor and multilayer perceptrons on shape features describing the tumor subregions. Our approach achieves 52.6% accuracy, a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.496 and a mean square error of 209607 on the test set.","authors":["Fabian Isensee","Philipp Kickingereder","Wolfgang Wick","Martin Bendszus"],"meta":["September 2018Lecture Notes in Computer Science","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-75238-9_25","In book: Brainlesion: Glioma, Multiple Sclerosis, Stroke and Traumatic Brain Injuries (pp.287-297)"],"references":["320762120_Computational_Radiomics_System_to_Decode_the_Radiographic_Phenotype","319493877_Advancing_The_Cancer_Genome_Atlas_glioma_MRI_collections_with_expert_segmentation_labels_and_radiomic_features","312216550_CNN-based_Segmentation_of_Medical_Imaging_Data","305683206_Instance_Normalization_The_Missing_Ingredient_for_Fast_Stylization","303129226_Imaging_patterns_predict_patient_survival_and_molecular_subtype_in_glioblastoma_via_machine_learning_techniques","301878860_Efficient_Multi-Scale_3D_CNN_with_fully_connected_CRF_for_Accurate_Brain_Lesion_Segmentation","275339963_The_Multimodal_Brain_Tumor_Image_Segmentation_Benchmark_BRATS","223713209_Wrappers_for_Feature_Subset_Selection","321542502_Brainlesion_Glioma_Multiple_Sclerosis_Stroke_and_Traumatic_Brain_Injuries_First_International_Workshop_Brainles_2015_Held_in_Conjunction_with_MICCAI_2015_Munich_Germany_October_5_2015_Revised_Selected","318642200_Segmentation_Labels_and_Radiomic_Features_for_the_Pre-operative_Scans_of_the_TCGA-LGG_collection","311754161_V-Net_Fully_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_Volumetric_Medical_Image_Segmentation","308277201_Identity_Mappings_in_Deep_Residual_Networks","305193694_U-Net_Convolutional_Networks_for_Biomedical_Image_Segmentation","297608770_Brain_Tumor_Segmentation_Using_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_in_MRI_Images","276296154_Brain_Tumor_Segmentation_with_Deep_Neural_Networks","269935079_Adam_A_Method_for_Stochastic_Optimization","220320024_A_New_Perspective_for_Information_Theoretic_Feature_Selection"]}
