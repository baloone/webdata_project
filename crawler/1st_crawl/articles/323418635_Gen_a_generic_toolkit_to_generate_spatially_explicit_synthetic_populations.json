{"id":"323418635_Gen_a_generic_toolkit_to_generate_spatially_explicit_synthetic_populations","abstract":"Agent-based models tend to integrate more and more data that can deeply impact their outcomes. Among these data, the ones that deal with agent attributes and localization are particularly important, but are very difficult to collect. In order to tackle this issue, we propose a complete generic toolkit called Gen* dedicated to generating spatially explicit synthetic populations from global (census and GIS) data. This article focuses on the localization methods provided by Gen* that are based on regression, geometrical constraints and spatial distributions. The toolkit is applied for a case study concerning the generation of the population of Rouen (France) and shows the capabilities of Gen* regarding population spatialization.","authors":["Kevin Chapuis","Patrick Taillandier","Renaud Misslin","Alexis Drogoul"],"meta":["February 2018International Journal of Geographical Information Science 32(2):1-17","DOI:10.1080/13658816.2018.1440563","Project: Genstar - Generation of synthetic population for social simulation"],"references":["313107309_Population_estimation_methods_in_GIS_and_remote_sensing_A_review","291174026_Exploring_Intra-Urban_Accessibility_and_Impacts_of_Pollution_Policies_with_an_Agent-Based_Simulation_Platform_GaMiroD","282826201_MOSAIIC_City-Level_Agent-Based_Traffic_Simulation_Adapted_to_Emergency_Situations","282354806_simSALUD_A_Web-based_Spatial_Microsimulation_to_Model_the_Health_Status_for_Small_Areas_Using_the_Example_of_Smokers_in_Austria","272492629_Disaggregating_Census_Data_for_Population_Mapping_Using_Random_Forests_with_Remotely-Sensed_and_Ancillary_Data","263708456_Methods_for_Estimating_Population_Density_in_Data-Limited_Areas_Evaluating_Regression_and_Tree-Based_Models_in_Peru","305208753_Simuler_les_mobilites_individuelles_Les_enjeux_de_l'information_geographique","280180534_Synthetic_Population_Generation_at_Disaggregated_Spatial_Scales_for_Land_Use_and_Transportation_Microsimulation","274239968_Using_Landsat_ETM_Imagery_to_Measure_Population_Density_in_Indianapolis_Indiana_USA","269527382_Creating_Synthetic_Household_Populations_Problems_and_Approach"]}
