{"id":"220789096_On_Variants_of_the_Spanning_Star_Forest_Problem","abstract":"A star forest is a collection of vertex-disjoint trees of depth at most 1, and its size is the number of leaves in all its components. A spanning star forest of a given graph G is a spanning subgraph of G that is also a star forest. The spanning star forest problem (SSF for short) [14] is to find the maximum-size spanning star forest of a given graph. In this paper, we study several variants of SSF, obtaining first or improved approximation and hardness results in all settings as shown below.\n1\nWe study SSF on graphs of minimum degree δ(n), n being the number of vertices in the input graph. Call this problem ( ≥ δ(n))-SSF. We give an (almost) complete characterization of the complexity of ( ≥ δ(n))-SSF with respect to δ(n) as follows.\nWhen 1 ≤ δ(n) ≤ O(1), ( ≥ δ(n))-SSF is APX-complete.\nWhen ω(1) ≤ δ(n) ≤ O(n\n1 − ε\n) for some constant ε > 0, ( ≥ δ(n))-SSF is NP-hard but admits a PTAS.\nWhen δ(n) ≥ ω(n\n1 − ε\n) for every constant ε > 0, ( ≥ δ(n))-SSF is not NP-hard assuming Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH).\n2\nWe investigate the spanning k-tree forest problem, which is a natural generalization of SSF. We obtain the first inapproximability bound of \\(1-\\Omega(\\frac{1}{k})\\) for this problem, which asymptotically matches the known approximation ratio of \\(1-\\frac{1}{k+1}\\) given in [13]. We then propose an approximation algorithm for it with a slightly improved approximation ratio of \\(1-\\frac{1}{k+2}\\).\n3\nWe prove that SSF cannot be approximated to any factor larger than \\(\\frac{244}{245}\\) in polynomial time, unless P = NP. This improves the previously best known bound of \\(\\frac{259}{260}\\) [14].","authors":["Jing He","Hongyu Liang"],"meta":["January 2011","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-21204-8_11","SourceDBLP","Conference: Frontiers in Algorithmics and Algorithmic Aspects in Information and Management - Joint International Conference, FAW-AAIM 2011, Jinhua, China, May 28-31, 2011.
