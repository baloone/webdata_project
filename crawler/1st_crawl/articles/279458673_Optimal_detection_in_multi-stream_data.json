{"id":"279458673_Optimal_detection_in_multi-stream_data","abstract":"Consider a large number of detectors each generating a data stream. The task\nhere is to detect online distribution changes in a small fraction of the data\nstreams. Previous approaches to this problem include the use of mixture\nlikelihood ratios and sum of CUSUMs. We provide here extensions and\nmodifications of these approaches that lead to optimal detection. More\nspecifically we show that minimum detection delay is achieved subject to the\nusual average run length constraint. The basic idea is to compute for each\nobservation a detectability score that is based on the likelihood ratio between\nno change, and a distribution change at the limits of detectability.","authors":["Chan Hock Peng"],"meta":["June 2015The Annals of Statistics 45(6)","DOI:10.1214/17-AOS1546","SourcearXiv"],"references":["237204793_Asymptotically_Optimal_Quickest_Change_Detection_in_Distributed_Sensor_Systems","229065891_Sequential_multi-sensor_change-point_detection","51931106_Detecting_simultaneous_intervals_in_aligned_sequences","38360176_Average_Run_Lengths_of_an_Optimal_Method_of_Detecting_a_Change_in_Distribution","38359134_Optimal_Detection_of_a_Change_in_Distribution","30760625_Procedures_for_Reacting_to_a_Change_in_Distribution","24014417_Innovated_higher_criticism_for_detecting_sparse_signals_in_correlated_noise","3085488_Near-Optimal_Detection_of_Geometric_Objects_by_Fast_Multiscale_Methods","2128121_Adaptive_multiscale_detection_of_filamentary_structures_in_a_background_of_uniform_random_points","2115236_Higher_criticism_for_detecting_sparse_heterogeneous_mixtures","281537763_Optimal_detection_of_multi-sample_aligned_sparse_signals","265444368_Sequential_Changepoint_Detection_in_Quality-Control_and_Dynamical-Systems","246831355_Minimax_detection_of_a_signal_for_l","245029754_Simultaneous_Discovery_of_Rare_and_Common_Segment_Variants","237131797_Some_Problems_of_Hypothesis_Testing_Leading_to_Infinitely_Divisible_Distribution","227464408_Efficient_scalable_schemes_for_monitoring_a_large_number_of_data_streams","45885370_Detection_of_spatial_clustering_with_average_likelihood_ratio_test_statistics","38360097_Optimal_Stopping_Times_for_Detecting_Changes_in_Distributions","2127935_Sequential_change-point_detection_when_unknown_parameters_are_present_in_the_pre-change_distribution"]}
