{"id":"272521897_The_Price_of_Local_Power_Control_in_Wireless_Scheduling","abstract":"We consider the problem of scheduling wireless links in the physical model,\nwhere we seek an assignment of power levels and a partition of the given set of\nlinks into the minimum number of subsets satisfying the\nsignal-to-interference-and-noise-ratio (SINR) constraints. Specifically, we are\ninterested in the efficiency of local power assignment schemes, or oblivious\npower schemes, in approximating wireless scheduling. Oblivious power schemes\nare motivated by networking scenarios when power levels must be decided in\nadvance, and not as part of the scheduling computation.\nWe first show that the known algorithms fail to obtain sub-logarithmic\nbounds; that is, their approximation ratio are $\\tilde\\Omega(\\log\n\\max(\\Delta,n))$, where $n$ is the number of links, $\\Delta$ is the ratio of\nthe maximum and minimum link lengths, and $\\tilde\\Omega$ hides\ndoubly-logarithmic factors. We then present the first\n$O(\\log{\\log\\Delta})$-approximation algorithm, which is known to be best\npossible (in terms of $\\Delta$) for oblivious power schemes. We achieve this by\nrepresenting interference by a conflict graph, which allows the application of\ngraph-theoretic results for a variety of related problems, including the\nweighted capacity problem. We explore further the contours of approximability,\nand find the choice of power assignment matters; that not all metric spaces are\nequal; and that the presence of weak links makes the problem harder. Combined,\nour result resolve the price of oblivious power for wireless scheduling, or the\nvalue of allowing unfettered power control.","authors":["Magnús M.
