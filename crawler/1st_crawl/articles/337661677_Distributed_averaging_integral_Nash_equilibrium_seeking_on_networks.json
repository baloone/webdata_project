{"id":"337661677_Distributed_averaging_integral_Nash_equilibrium_seeking_on_networks","abstract":"Continuous-time gradient-based Nash equilibrium seeking algorithms enjoy a passivity property under a suitable monotonicity assumption, which has been exploited to design distributed Nash equilibrium seeking algorithms. We further exploit the passivity property to interconnect the algorithms with distributed nonlinear averaging integral controllers that tune on-line the weights of the communication graph. The main advantage is to guarantee convergence to a Nash equilibrium without requiring a strong coupling condition on the algebraic connectivity of the communication graph over which the players exchange information, nor a global fixed high-gain.","authors":["Claudio De Persis","Sergio Grammatico"],"meta":["December 2019Automatica 110(2):108548","DOI:10.1016/j.automatica.2019.108548"],"references":["316784990_A_Passivity-Based_Approach_to_Nash_Equilibrium_Seeking_Over_Networks","301818902_Distributed_Algorithms_for_Aggregative_Games_on_Graphs","282692147_Asymptotic_convergence_of_constrained_primal-dual_dynamics","260661668_Distributed_Seeking_of_Nash_Equilibria_With_Applications_to_Mobile_Sensor_Networks","225170837_The_Krakovskii-LaSalle_Invariance_Principle_for_a_Class_of_Unilateral_Dynamical_Systems","224227629_Nash_Equilibrium_Problems_With_Scaled_Congestion_Costs_and_Shared_Constraints","332171475_On_Games_With_Coupled_Constraints","329506201_Continuous-time_integral_dynamics_for_aggregative_game_equilibrium_seeking","323722894_Hybrid_Interconnection_of_Iterative_Bidding_and_Power_Network_Dynamics_for_Frequency_Regulation_and_Optimal_Dispatch","320150991_Stability_and_robustness_for_saddle-point_dynamics_through_monotone_mappings","317799390_Semi-Decentralized_Nash_Equilibrium_Seeking_in_Aggregative_Games_With_Separable_Coupling_Constraints_and_Non-Differentiable_Cost_Functions","305844362_Distributed_Nash_equilibrium_seeking_A_gossip-based_algorithm","301857346_Distributed_Nash_Equilibrium_Seeking_by_A_Consensus_Based_Approach","281808397_Adaptation_and_Disturbance_Rejection_for_Output_Synchronization_of_Incrementally_Output-feedback_Passive_Systems","267092812_Existence_and_Uniqueness_of_Equilibrium_Points_for_Concave_N-Person_Games","254058700_Nash_Equilibrium_Seeking_in_Noncooperative_Games","233982331_Real_and_Complex_Monotone_Communication_Games","222551824_Nonpathological_Lyapunov_functions_and_discontinuous_Caratheodory_systems","222467682_Distributed_algorithms_for_the_computation_of_noncooperative_equilibria","222106071_Distributed_convergence_to_Nash_equilibria_in_two-network_zero-sum_games","220158055_On_the_variational_equilibrium_as_a_refinement_of_the_generalized_Nash_equilibrium"]}
