{"id":"268367061_Towards_Run-Time_Flexibility_for_Process_Families_Open_Issues_and_Research_Challenges","abstract":"The increasing adoption of process-aware information sys-tems and the high variability of business processes in practice have re-sulted in process model repositories with large collections of related pro-cess variants (i.e., process families). Existing approaches for variability management focus on the modeling and configuration of process vari-ants. However, case studies have shown that run-time configuration and re-configuration as well as the evolution of process variants are essential as well. Effectively handling process variants in these lifecycle phases re-quires deferring certain configuration decisions to the run-time, dynam-ically re-configuring process variants in response to contextual changes, adapting process variants to emerging needs, and evolving process fam-ilies over time. In this paper, we characterize these flexibility needs for process families, discuss fundamental challenges to be tackled, and pro-vide an overview of existing proposals made in this context.","authors":["Clara Ayora","Victoria Torres","Manfred Reichert","Barbara Weber"],"meta":["January 2013Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing 132","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-36285-9_49","Conference: International Conference on Business Process Management"],"references":["268206386_A_Qualitative_Comparison_of_Approaches_Supporting_Business_Process_Variability","249843982_On_the_Notion_of_Flexibility_in_Business_Processes","235949879_Managing_Large_Collections_of_Business_Process_Models_Current_Techniques_and_Challenges","229124837_Enabling_Flexibility_in_Process-Aware_Information_Systems_Challenges_Methods_Technologies","228725956_Organizational_reference_models_Supporting_an_adequate_design_of_local_business_processes","228618501_Exception_handling_patterns_in_process-aware_information_systems","228609763_Context-based_configuration_of_process_variants","313838056_Capturing_variability_in_business_process_models_The_Provop_approach","261313307_ITC-IRST_Trento","257001768_Design_and_management_of_flexible_process_variants_using_templates_and_rules"]}
