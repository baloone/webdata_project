{"id":"321325183_Cost-Effective_Active_Learning_for_Melanoma_Segmentation","abstract":"We propose a novel Active Learning framework capable to train effectively a convolutional neural network for semantic segmentation of medical imaging, with a limited amount of training labeled data. Our contribution is a practical Cost-Effective Active Learning approach using dropout at test time as Monte Carlo sampling to model the pixel-wise uncertainty and to analyze the image information to improve the training performance.
