{"id":"356162461_Determinants_of_Intercity_Air-Passenger_Flows_in_the_Belt_and_Road_Region","abstract":"jats:p>Air-passenger flow, denoting intercity connections, has been a focal point of studies pertaining to urban networks. While most existing studies include only the geoeconomic characteristics of nodes as explanatory variables, this analysis developed a gravity model by incorporating further factors (e.g., cultural disparity and institutional disparity) that might influence air-passenger flows in the “Belt and Road” region. The primary findings are as follows: (1) The cultural and institutional disparities correlate negatively with the air-passenger flows in this region; (2) air-passenger flows are positively related to border, population and economy size, and economic disparity; (3) flows tend to first increase and then subsequently decrease as geographical distance increases; (4) the impact of the factors on the flows varies by subregion. This study could serve as a reference for those interested in gaining a greater insight into air-passenger flows and could also help improve regional strategies for air-transportation development.</jats:p","authors":["Lu Zhang","Yannan Zhao","Bart Dessein","Philippe De Maeyer"],"meta":["November 2021Complexity 2021(9)","DOI:10.1155/2021/5514135"],"references":["352126952_Analysis_of_Network_Robustness_in_Weighted_and_Unweighted_Approaches_A_Case_Study_of_the_Air_Transport_Network_in_the_Belt_and_Road_Region","347859810_The_spatial_distribution_of_retail_outlets_in_Urumqi_The_application_of_points_of_interest","343680095_The_future_of_airports_post_COVID-19","335940746_Drawing_topological_properties_from_a_multi-layered_network_The_case_of_an_air_transport_network_in_the_Belt_and_Road_region","352688720_Human_Values_and_Social_Change_Findings_from_the_Values_Surveys","345033254_Human_Factors_in_Multi-Crew_Flight_Operations","344343805_How_did_COVID-19_impact_air_transportation_A_first_peek_through_the_lens_of_complex_networks","343930873_The_impacts_of_COVID-19_on_the_global_airline_industryAn_event_study_approach","343492691_Effect_Mechanisms_of_Peasant_Relocation_Decision-making_Behaviours_in_the_Process_of_Rural_Spatial_Restructuring_The_case_of_Hotan_region_China","340415801_Aviation_economics_and_forecasting","334555708_Robustness_and_Edge_Addition_Strategy_of_Air_Transport_Networks_A_Case_Study_of_the_Belt_and_Road","323089587_Belarusian_Mentality_in_the_Context_of_Intercultural_Communication_Grounds_or_Pessimism_and_Optimism","321507695_Urban_networks_among_Chinese_cities_along_the_Belt_and_Road_A_case_of_web_search_activity_in_cyberspace","318396764_How_Do_Cultural_and_Institutional_Distance_Affect_China's_OFDI_towards_the_OBOR_Countries","319574270_The_Trade-Off_between_Foreign_Direct_Investments_and_Exports_The_Role_of_Multiple_Dimensions_of_Distance"]}
