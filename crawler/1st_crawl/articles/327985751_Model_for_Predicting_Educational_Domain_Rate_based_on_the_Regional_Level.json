GIS can be used to identify the factors that become the reason for an individual to adopt a field or subject. We used GIS as a major tool with the other technologies to identify the key factors. This research has analyzed that mostly people used to migrate to other cities due to unavailability of resources in their own region. Collection of data was done with the help of Survey 123 through which we were able to collect location coordinates of participants. After that, Pilot study approach used to conduct this research. Results show that mostly user preferred to move to other cities due to unavailability of programs in local institutes. The overall idea can be used to improvement of local institutes and this research can also be used for proper and efficient allocation of facilities and resources in a region, which in turn can save money and time.
