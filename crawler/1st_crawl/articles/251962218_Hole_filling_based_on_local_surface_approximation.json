{"id":"251962218_Hole_filling_based_on_local_surface_approximation","abstract":"The hole-free triangular mesh model is prerequisite for many applications. A new method of hole-filling is presented in this paper. Firstly, the hole-polygons were extracted with Mean Shift approach to obtain the set of their neighboring vertices which have similar geometry property to the holes. Then the constraint Delaunay triangulation method was employed to fill holes and the new created triangles were subdivided to keep the same resolution as neighbors according to the edge length. Finally, the added vertexes in the region of the hole were projected on the surface which is approximated by the hole neighborhood. The experiment demonstrates the result of hole-filling can recover the original shape of the hole region precisely and effectively.","authors":["He Qiang","Zhang Shusheng","Bai Xiaoliang","Zhang Xin"],"meta":["October 2010","DOI:10.1109/ICCASM.2010.5620018"],"references":["224565494_Filling_holes_in_triangular_meshes_by_curve_unfolding","221625760_Automatic_Hole-Filling_of_Triangular_Meshes_Using_Local_Radial_Basis_Function","220632805_An_on-line_algorithm_for_constrained_Delaunay_triangulation","220183897_Automatic_restoration_of_polygon_models","4301214_A_Robust_Hole-Filling_Algorithm_for_Triangular_Mesh","260655981_Simplification_and_repair_of_polygonal_modes_using_volumetric_techniques","223432137_Filling_holes_in_meshes_using_a_mechanical_model_to_simulate_the_curvature_variation_minimization","221316515_Filling_Holes_in_Meshes","220632355_Normal_Vector_Voting_Crease_Detection_and_Curvature_Estimation_on_Large_Noisy_Meshes","220583171_A_piecewise_hole_filling_algorithm_in_reverse_engineering","220539528_Filling_Holes_in_Triangular_Meshes_Using_Digital_Images_by_Curve_Unfolding","220184546_Robust_repair_of_polygonal_models","200027699_Drawing_curves_onto_a_cloud_of_points_for_point-based_modelling","4206157_Feature_Sensitive_Mesh_Segmentation_with_Mean_Shift","3962036_Filling_Holes_In_Complex_Surfaces_Using_Volumetric_Diffusion"]}
