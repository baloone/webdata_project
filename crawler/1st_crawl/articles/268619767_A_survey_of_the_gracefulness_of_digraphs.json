{"id":"268619767_A_survey_of_the_gracefulness_of_digraphs","abstract":"Graph labeling traces its origin to the famous conjecture that all trees are graceful presented by A. Rosa [“On certain valuations of the vertices of a graph,” Theory Graphs, Int. Symp. Rome 1966, 349–355 (1967; Zbl 0193.53204)]. In recent years, many research papers on graceful graph have been published. In this survey we have collected studies on the gracefulness of the directed circuit C → m and the union graph of mutually non-intersecting C → m , the digraph n·C → m , the digraph n-C → m , the union of the digraph n·C → 3 , and give some results.","authors":["Wei Feng","Chunlei Xu","Jirimutu"],"meta":["January 2011International Journal of Pure and Applied Mathematics 69(3)"],"references":["298253615_The_graphs_C5_t_are_graceful_for_t_0_3_mod_4","291262944_The_graphs_C7_t_are_graceful_for_t_0_1_mod_4","268026036_Proof_of_a_conjecture_on_the_gracefulness_of_a_digraph","266034459_On_the_gracefulness_of_the_digraphs_nC_m"]}
