{"id":"278413775_Pattern-avoiding_permutations_and_Brownian_excursion_Part_II_Fixed_points","abstract":"Permutations that avoid given patterns are among the most classical objects\nin combinatorics and have strong connections to many fields of mathematics,\ncomputer science and biology. In this paper we study fixed points of both 123-\nand 231-avoiding permutations. We find an exact description for a scaling limit\nof the empirical distribution of fixed points in term of Brownian excursion.\nThis builds on the connections between pattern-avoiding permutations and\nBrownian excursion developed in Part I of this series and strengthens the\nrecent results of Elizalde (2012) and Miner and Pak (2014) on fixed points of\npattern-avoiding permutations.","authors":["Christopher Hoffman","Douglas Rizzolo","Erik Slivken"],"meta":["October 2017Probability Theory and Related Fields 169(1-2)","DOI:10.1007/s00440-016-0732-2","SourcearXiv"],"references":["346057975_Foundations_of_Modern_Probability","279957910_Sums_of_Independent_Random_Variables","268442261_Essay_d''Analyse_sur_les_Jeux_de_Hazard","266909814_Brownian_motion_With_an_appendix_by_Oded_Schramm_and_Wendelin_Werner","265492750_Random_pattern-avoiding_permutations","263281446_Pattern-avoiding_permutations_and_Brownian_excursion_Part_I_Shapes_and_fluctuations","261144645_Foundations_of_Modern_Probability","259893424_Structure_of_Random_312-Avoiding_Permutations","236326008_The_Shape_of_Random_Pattern_Avoiding_Permutations","225916278_Excursions_in_Brownian_motion","222836318_Bijections_for_refined_restricted_permutations","222577967_Permutations_with_Restricted_Patterns_and_Dyck_Paths","220693528_Analytic_Combinatorics","220688483_The_Art_of_Computer_Programming_Volume_I_Fundamental_Algorithms","51915854_SchrOder's_problems_and_scaling_limits_of_random_trees"]}
