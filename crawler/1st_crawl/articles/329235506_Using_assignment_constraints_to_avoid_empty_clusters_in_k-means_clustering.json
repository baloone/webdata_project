{"id":"329235506_Using_assignment_constraints_to_avoid_empty_clusters_in_k-means_clustering","abstract":"We consider practical methods for adding constraints to the k-means clustering algorithm in order to avoid local solutions with empty clusters or clusters having very few points. We often observe this phenomena when applying k-means to data sets where the number of dimensions is d ≥ 10 and the number of desired clusters is k ≥ 20. Moreover, recent studies have shown successful formulations of various other types of constraints. Particularly, must-link and cannot-link types constraints have been studied in several papers. An appropriate objective function needs to be constructed to ﬁnd clusters that satisfy minimum capacity, must-link and cannot-link pairwise constraints at the same time. Obviously, it requires an analysis of the applicability and the level of complexity of the constraint types.","authors":["Ayhan Demiriz","Kristin P. Bennett","P.S.
