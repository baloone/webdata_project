{"id":"331958036_SMARCAD1_ATPase_activity_is_required_to_silence_endogenous_retroviruses_in_embryonic_stem_cells","abstract":"Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) can confer benefits to their host but present a threat to genome integrity if not regulated correctly. Here we identify the SWI/SNF-like remodeler SMARCAD1 as a key factor in the control of ERVs in embryonic stem cells. SMARCAD1 is enriched at ERV subfamilies class I and II, particularly at active intracisternal A-type particles (IAPs), where it preserves repressive histone methylation marks. Depletion of SMARCAD1 results in de-repression of IAPs and adjacent genes. Recruitment of SMARCAD1 to ERVs is dependent on KAP1, a central component of the silencing machinery. SMARCAD1 and KAP1 occupancy at ERVs is co-dependent and requires the ATPase function of SMARCAD1. Our findings uncover a role for the enzymatic activity of SMARCAD1 in cooperating with KAP1 to silence ERVs. This reveals ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling as an integral step in retrotransposon regulation in stem cells and advances our understanding of the mechanisms driving heterochromatin establishment.","authors":["Parysatis Sachs","Dong Ding","Philipp Bergmaier","Boris Lamp"],"meta":["March 2019Nature Communications 10(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41467-019-09078-0"],"references":["326089432_KAP1_facilitates_reinstatement_of_heterochromatin_after_DNA_replication","323844488_Human_Endogenous_Retroviruses_in_Neurological_Diseases","322611153_SETDB1_prevents_TET2-dependent_activation_of_IAP_retroelements_in_naive_embryonic_stem_cells","322105333_The_CUE1_domain_of_the_SNF2-like_chromatin_remodeler_SMARCAD1_mediates_its_association_with_KRAB-associated_protein_1_KAP1_and_KAP1_target_genes","318558043_The_prevalence_and_metabolic_characteristics_of_polycystic_ovary_syndrome_in_the_Qatari_population","315893889_SMARCAD1_Contributes_to_the_Regulation_of_Naive_Pluripotency_by_Interacting_with_Histone_Citrullination","313335367_Silencing_of_endogenous_retroviruses_by_heterochromatin","318833001_KRAB_zinc_finger_proteins","318106934_Genome-wide_analysis_of_ATP-dependent_chromatin_remodeling_functions_in_embryonic_stem_cells","317005002_Mechanisms_of_action_and_regulation_of_ATP-dependent_chromatin-remodelling_complexes","312160069_TRIM28_Controls_a_Gene_Regulatory_Network_Based_on_Endogenous_Retroviruses_in_Human_Neural_Progenitor_Cells","311338080_Endogenous_retroviral_promoter_exaptation_in_human_cancer","302870368_Transposable_elements_in_the_mammalian_embryo_Pioneers_surviving_through_stealth_and_service","313113058_The_evolutionary_capacitor_HSP90_buffers_the_regulatory_effects_of_mammalian_endogenous_retroviruses","311424207_Ultrafast_and_memory-efficient_alignment_of_short_DNA_sequences_to_the_human_genome"]}
