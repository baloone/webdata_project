{"id":"320296685_Entanglement-Gradient_Routing_for_Quantum_Networks","abstract":"We define the entanglement-gradient routing scheme for quantum repeater networks. The routing framework fuses the fundamentals of swarm intelligence and quantum Shannon theory. Swarm intelligence provides nature-inspired solutions for problem solving. Motivated by models of social insect behavior, the routing is performed using parallel threads to determine the shortest path via the entanglement gradient coefficient, which describes the feasibility of the entangled links and paths of the network. The routing metrics are derived from the characteristics of entanglement transmission and relevant measures of entanglement distribution in quantum networks. The method allows a moderate complexity decentralized routing in quantum repeater networks. The results can be applied in experimental quantum networking, future quantum Internet, and long-distance quantum communications.","authors":["Laszlo Gyongyosi","Sandor Imre"],"meta":["October 2017Scientific Reports 7(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-017-14394-w"],"references":["315124252_Quantum_imaging_of_high-dimensional_Hilbert_spaces_with_Radon_transform","311067084_Quantum_Machine_Learning","308744265_Quantum_Secure_Direct_Communication_with_Quantum_Memory","317941604_Distributed_secure_quantum_machine_learning","291184753_Optical_microcavity_from_fundamental_physics_to_functional_photonics_devices","285945223_Quantum_Networking","281448958_Ant_Colony_for_Locality_Foraging_in_Image_Enhancement","276970779_Photonic_Channels_for_Quantum_Communication","266553671_Advanced_Quantum_Communications_An_Engineering_Approach","264474309_Photon-echo_quantum_memory_in_solid_state_systems"]}
