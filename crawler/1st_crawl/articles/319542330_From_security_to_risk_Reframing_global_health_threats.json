{"id":"319542330_From_security_to_risk_Reframing_global_health_threats","abstract":"The rise of health issues such as HIV and AIDS, pandemic influenza and Ebola on international agendas has led to the framing of threats to health as security issues. Recent concerns over the negative effects of this dominant narrative have been paralleled by an interest in an alternative frame, that of risk. The appeal of this frame lies in the technical nature of risk assessment in public health, which provides it with an aura of scientific objectivity and rationality, while the potentially catastrophic scale of the risk constructs a moral imperative to act. This article examines the move from global health security to global health risk, and its implications for policy responses. It argues that the use of the global risk frame does not offer a route to avoid values and interests, but is inherently political. At the same time, the global health risk frame reflect the wider zeitgeist concerning societal vulnerability and positions global health within that context.","authors":["Colin Mcinnes","Anne roemer-mahler"],"meta":["August 2017International Affairs 93(6)","DOI:10.1093/ia/iix187"],"references":["230750183_The_Effectiveness_of_US_Public_Health_Surveillance_Systems_for_Situational_Awareness_during_the_2009_H1N1_Pandemic_A_Retrospective_Analysis","43346109_Brazil_and_the_Framework_Convention_on_Tobacco_Control_Global_Health_Diplomacy_as_Soft_Power","5594286_Influenza_Virus_Samples_International_Law_and_Global_Health_Diplomacy","5299070_Protecting_global_health_security_through_the_International_Health_Regulations","312545668_CEPI-a_new_global_RD_organisation_for_epidemic_preparedness_and_response","7287209_The_New_International_Health_Regulations_An_Historic_Development_for_International_Law_and_Public_Health"]}
