{"id":"274417953_A_Symmetrical_Coordinate_Frame_on_the_Hexagonal_Grid_for_Computer_Graphics_and_Vision","abstract":"This paper investigates the hexagonal tessellation of picture elements used in computer graphics and computer vision systems. Its purpose is to propose a symmetrical hexagonal coordinate frame to replace the existing oblique coordinate system. In the proposed symmetrical coordinate frame, spatial properties of the hexagonal grid such as distance functions are better represented.","authors":["Innchyn Her"],"meta":["September 1993Journal of Mechanical Design 115(3):447","DOI:10.1115/1.2919210"],"references":[]}
