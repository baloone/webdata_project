{"id":"220199844_A_genetic_algorithm_for_maximum-weighted_tree_matching_problem","abstract":"In hierarchal organizations, for assigning tasks to the divisions of the organization some constraints must be satisfied. This article investigates one such problem in which there are k different tasks to be accomplished and each divisionâ€™s performance on each task may be different and represented by a scalar value. In this article we formally introduce this real life decision problem, named as Maximum-Weighted Tree Matching Problem, and propose a genetic algorithm solution to it, and give some experimental results.","authors":["Mehmet Gulek","Ismail Hakki Toroslu"],"meta":["September 2010Applied Soft Computing 10(4):1127-1131","DOI:10.1016/j.asoc.2009.09.013","SourceDBLP"],"references":["265426020_Algorithms_for_the_Assignment_and_Transportation_Problems","245452726_On_the_assignment_and_transportation_problems_abstract","242356870_Adaptation_In_Natural_And_Artificial_Systems","240915097_Personnel_assignment_problem_with_hierarchical_ordering_constraints","236344183_The_Hungarian_Method_for_the_Assignment_Problem","233011815_Maximum_weight_matching_and_genetic_algorithm_for_fixed-shape_facility_layout_problem","223890298_Selecting_critical_clinical_features_for_heart_diseases_diagnosis_with_a_real-coded_genetic_algorithm","223883036_An_integrated_multi-objective_optimization_and_fuzzy_multi-attribute_group_decision-making_technique_for_subdivision_arrangement_of_RO-RO_vessels","223635085_Multi-criteria_human_resource_allocation_for_solving_multistage_combinatorial_optimization_problems_using_multiobjective_hybrid_genetic_algorithm","223584006_Genetic_algorithm_for_the_personnel_assignment_problem_with_multiple_objectives","222692543_Evolutionary_hybrid_approaches_for_generation_scheduling_in_power_systems","222679763_Automatic_extraction_and_identification_of_chart_patterns_towards_financial_forecast","222405352_Hybrid_adaptive_predictive_control_for_the_multi-vehicle_dynamic_pick-up_and_delivery_problem_based_on_genetic_algorithms_and_fuzzy_clustering","221996415_The_Hungarian_Method_for_The_Assignment_Problem","201976160_Simple_Genetic_Algorithms_and_the_Minimal_Deceptive_Problem"]}
