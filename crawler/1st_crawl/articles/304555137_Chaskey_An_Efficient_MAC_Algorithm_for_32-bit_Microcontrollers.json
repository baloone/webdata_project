{"id":"304555137_Chaskey_An_Efficient_MAC_Algorithm_for_32-bit_Microcontrollers","abstract":"We propose Chaskey: a very efficient Message Authentication Code (MAC) algorithm for 32-bit microcontrollers. It is intended for applications that require 128-bit security, yet cannot implement standard MAC algorithms because of stringent requirements on speed, energy consumption, or code size. Chaskey is a permutation-based MAC algorithm that uses the Addition-Rotation-XOR (ARX) design methodology. We prove that Chaskey is secure in the standard model, based on the security of an underlying Even-Mansour block cipher. Chaskey is designed to perform well on a wide range of 32-bit microcontrollers. Our benchmarks show that on the ARM Cortex-M3/M4, our Chaskey implementation reaches a speed of 7.0 cycles/byte, compared to 89.4 cycles/byte for AES-128-CMAC. For the ARM Cortex-M0, our benchmark results give 16.9 cycles/byte and 136.5 cycles/byte for Chaskey and AES-128-CMAC respectively.","authors":["Nicky Mouha","Bart Mennink","Anthony Van Herrewege","Dai Watanabe"],"meta":["August 2014","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-13051-4_19","Conference: International Workshop on Selected Areas in Cryptography"],"references":["225990394_KATAN_and_KTANTAN-a_family_of_small_and_efficient_hardware-oriented_block_ciphers","225958853_Rotational_Cryptanalysis_of_ARX","221327131_Known-Key_Distinguishers_for_Some_Block_Ciphers","221326929_Biclique_Cryptanalysis_of_the_Full_AES","220942532_Slide_Attacks","220942410_The_Rebound_Attack_Cryptanalysis_of_Reduced_Whirlpool_and_Grostl","220942402_A_new_MAC_construction_ALRED_and_a_specific_instance_ALPHA-MAC","220798509_Improved_Meet-in-the-Middle_Cryptanalysis_of_KTANTAN_Poster","220334857_Bicliques_for_Preimages_Attacks_on_Skein-512_and_the_SHA-2_Family","220334188_The_Pelican_MAC_Function","272172096_Recommendation_for_block_cipher_modes_of_operation_GaloisCounter_Mode_GCM_and_GMAC","267800434_SipHash_a_fast_short-input_PRF","267441146_Construction_of_Differential_Characteristics_in_ARX_Designs_Application_to_Skein","266657434_Ultra_low-power_implementation_of_ECC_on_the_ARM_Cortex-M0","264874027_Zero-sum_distinguishers_for_reduced_Keccak-f_and_for_the_core_functions_of_Luffa_and_Hamsi","262366317_Analysis_of_Differential_Attacks_in_ARX_Constructions","262208185_On_Bruteforce-Like_Cryptanalysis_New_Meet-in-the-Middle_Attacks_in_Symmetric_Cryptanalysis","245623885_CBC_MACs_for_Arbitrary-Length_The_Three-Key_Constructions","242407495_Recommendation_for_Block_Cipher_Modes_of_Operation_The_CMAC_Mode_for_Authentication","227328607_Efficient_Algorithms_for_Computing_Differential_Properties_of_Addition","226737356_Message_Authentication_on_64-Bit_Architectures","225925972_Cube_Attacks_on_Tweakable_Black_Box_Polynomials","225807994_Trivium","225181029_Indifferentiability_Impossibility_Results_on_Reductions_and_Applications_to_the_Random_Oracle_Methodology","225177225_A_construction_of_a_cipher_from_a_single_pseudorandom_permutation","222466434_New_hash_functions_and_their_use_in_authentication_and_set_equality","222457947_Universal_classes_of_hash_functions","221355504_Some_Regular_Properties_of_the_'Data_Encryption_Standard'_Algorithm","221355038_UMAC_Fast_and_Secure_Message_Authentication","221348029_A_theoretical_treatment_of_related-key_attacks_RKA-PRPs_RKA-PRFs_and_applications","221274712_Preimage_Attacks_on_One-Block_MD4_63-Step_MD5_and_More","221208430_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","220942647_The_Poly1305-AES_message-authentication_code","220942564_New_Features_of_Latin_Dances_Analysis_of_Salsa_ChaCha_and_Rumba","220942504_OMAC_One-key_CBC_MAC","220905129_Trivium_A_Stream_Cipher_Construction_Inspired_by_Block_Cipher_Design_Principles","220798746_Preimage_Attacks_on_Step-Reduced_MD5","220334840_A_3-Subset_Meet-in-the-Middle_Attack_Cryptanalysis_of_the_Lightweight_Block_Cipher_KTANTAN","220333177_Minimalism_in_Cryptography_The_Even-Mansour_Scheme_Revisited","2828972_A_Construction_of_a_Cipher_From_a_Single_Pseudorandom_Permutation","2775996_The_Security_of_Cipher_Block_Chaining","2686415_New_Types_of_Cryptanalytic_Attacks_Using_Related_Keys","2685871_New_Types_of_Cryptanalytic_Attacks_using_Related_Keys","2630951_MDx-MAC_and_building_fast_MACs_from_hash_functions","2582060_Timing_Attacks_on_Implementations_of_Diffie-Hellman_RSA_DSS_and_Other_Systems","2572143_Stronger_security_bounds_for_OMAC_TMAC_and_XCBC","2566899_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","2290039_Keying_Hash_Functions_for_Message_Authentication"]}
