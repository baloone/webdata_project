It is inspired in the theory of Matthew Lipman, as it was conceived through the redefinition of the concept of Learning Communities, to assist the students to maximize their learning through the conscientious evaluation of their level of self-efficacy, while they develop a better behavior to study programming. We present the results of the preliminary tests made to the proposed strategy, and the changes in the strategy that result from those results.","authors":["Scheila Wesley Martins","Antonio Jose Mendes","Antonio Dias de Figueiredo"],"meta":["January 2010"],"references":["317468483_Escala_de_Motivacao_Academica_uma_medida_de_motivacao_extrinseca_e_intrinseca","251541868_RENDIMENTO_ACADEMICO_INFLUENCIA_DOS_METODOS_DE_ESTUDOS","321876171_Processing_Creative_Coding_and_Computational_Art","317953663_Self-Efficacy_Toward_a_Unifying_Theory_of_Behavioral_Change","285985052_Motivational_Design_for_Learning_and_Performance_The_ARCS_Model_Approach","275780233_Science_and_general_education","258143114_Improving_Self-Efficacy_and_Motivation_What_to_Do_What_to_Say","249807763_ERIC_Review_Learning_Communities_at_the_Community_College","248917253_Thinking_in_Education","242628031_Just-In-Time_Teaching_Blending_Active_Learning_with_Web_Technology"]}
