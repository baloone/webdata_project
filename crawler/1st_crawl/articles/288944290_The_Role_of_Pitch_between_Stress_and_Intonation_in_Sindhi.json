{"id":"288944290_The_Role_of_Pitch_between_Stress_and_Intonation_in_Sindhi","abstract":"The present research paper is based on the investigation of pitch role between stress and intonation in Sindhi. The analysis demonstrates an initial ground for a major intonation study in Sindhi. The research was carried out in the Phonetic Laboratory UIUC, USA, to determine the relationship between stress and intonation. The speakers recorded 69 words in contrastive focus for pitch accent analysis. The stimuli included every possible syllable template involving short and long vowels preceding and following consonants. The stimuli consists of 17 disyllabic, 22 tri-syllabic, 20 four-syllable, and 10 five-syllable words. Participants were two male adult Sindhi native speakers, one graduate PhD candidate (R) from UIUC, USA, and the author who was also a PhD candidate, visiting research scholar at UIUC, USA. Fundamental frequency (F0) of vowel pitch contours were analyzed for evidence that the location of the beginning of the pitch rise, or the pitch peak varies in relation to the location of the stressed syllable in Sindhi words. Specifically, it investigates the role of stress in the alignment of the pitch rise that marks pitch accent. The experimental analysis provides no explicit acoustic evidence for the heavy syllable nor for the light syllable as accented.","authors":["Dr Abdul Malik Abbasi"],"meta":["December 2015"],"references":["289076909_Phonetic_Analysis_of_Lexical_Stress_in_Sindhi","270711170_Analysis_of_voice_fundamental_frequency_contours_for_declarative_sentences_of_Japanese","259810776_PRAAT_Doing_phonetics_by_computer_Version_5351","292705986_Basque_accentuation","290852872_Sindhi","271017613_Intonational_Phonology","270150332_Basque_Phonology","269424052_A_Course_in_Phonetics","254866809_Understanding_Phonology","243767986_Stress_and_Non-Stress_Accent"]}
