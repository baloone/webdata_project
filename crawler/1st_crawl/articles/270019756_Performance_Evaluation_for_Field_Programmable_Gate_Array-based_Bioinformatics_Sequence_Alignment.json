{"id":"270019756_Performance_Evaluation_for_Field_Programmable_Gate_Array-based_Bioinformatics_Sequence_Alignment","abstract":"Sequence alignment is a computationally expensive activity in bioinformatics that can benefit significantly from Field Programmable Gate Array-based high-performance computing systems. This paper evaluates the performance of such systems for bioinformatics sequence alignment applications considering various parameters like data bus width (W), the number of processing elements, and the maximum operating frequency.","authors":["L.
