{"id":"220285889_The_structure_of_the_genetic_programming_collaboration_network","abstract":"The genetic programming bibliography aims to be the most complete reference of papers on genetic programming. In addition to locating publications, it contains coauthor and coeditor relationships which have not previously been studied. These reveal some similarities and differences between our field and collaborative social networks in other scientific fields.","authors":["Marco Tomassini","Leslie Luthi","Mario Giacobini","William B.
