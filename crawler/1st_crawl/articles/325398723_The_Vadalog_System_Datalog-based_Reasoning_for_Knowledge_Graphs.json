{"id":"325398723_The_Vadalog_System_Datalog-based_Reasoning_for_Knowledge_Graphs","abstract":"Over the past years, there has been a resurgence of Datalog-based systems in the database community as well as in industry. In this context, it has been recognized that to handle the complex knowl- edge-based scenarios encountered today, such as reasoning over large knowledge graphs, Datalog has to be extended with features such as existential quantification. Yet, Datalog-based reasoning in the presence of existential quantification is in general undecid- able. Many efforts have been made to define decidable fragments. Warded Datalog+/- is a very promising one, as it captures PTIME complexity while allowing ontological reasoning. Yet so far, no im- plementation of Warded Datalog+/- was available. In this paper we present the Vadalog system, a Datalog-based system for performing complex logic reasoning tasks, such as those required in advanced knowledge graphs. The Vadalog system is Oxfordâ€™s contribution to the VADA research programme, a joint effort of the universi- ties of Oxford, Manchester and Edinburgh and around 20 indus- trial partners. As the main contribution of this paper, we illustrate the first implementation of Warded Datalog+/-, a high-performance Datalog+/- system utilizing an aggressive termination control strat- egy. We also provide a comprehensive experimental evaluation.","authors":["Luigi Bellomarini","Emanuel Sallinger","Georg Gottlob"],"meta":["May 2018Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment 11(9)","DOI:10.14778/3213880.3213888"],"references":["315379943_That's_All_Folks_Llunatic_Goes_Open_Source","305446011_The_iBench_integration_metadata_generator","326335934_A_General_Datalog-Based_Framework_for_Tractable_Query_Answering_Over_Ontologies","322009579_Swift_Logic_for_Big_Data_and_Knowledge_Graphs","318829969_Logic_on_MARS_Ontologies_for_Generalised_Property_Graphs","315380028_Benchmarking_the_Chase","313680135_Column-Oriented_Datalog_Materialization_for_Large_Knowledge_Graphs","313453602_Datalography_Scaling_datalog_graph_analytics_on_graph_processing_systems","305081646_Functional_Dependencies_Unleashed_for_Scalable_Data_Exchange","304352133_Ontop_Answering_SPARQL_queries_over_relational_databases","286031338_Parallel_materialisation_of_datalog_programs_in_centralised_main-memory_RDF_systems","300590310_Design_and_Implementation_of_the_LogicBlox_System","289214746_Tractable_query_answering_over_ontologies_with_Datalog","282066120_Graal_A_Toolkit_for_Query_Answering_with_Existential_Rules","276465265_Querying_with_access_patterns_and_integrity_constraints"]}
