{"id":"320688223_Fuzzy_conditional_random_fields_for_temporal_data_mining","abstract":"Temporal data mining is one of the interesting problems in computer science and its application has been performed in a wide variety of fields. The difference between the temporal data mining and data mining is the use of variable time. Therefore, the method used must be capable of processing variables of time. Compared with other methods, conditional random field has advantages in the processing variables of time. The method is a directed graph models that has been widely applied for segmenting and labelling sequence data that appears in various domains. In this study, we proposed use of Fuzzy Logic to be applied in Conditional Random Fields to overcome the problems of uncertainty. The experiment is compared Fuzzy Conditional Random Fields, Conditional Random Fields, and Hidden Markov Models. The result showed that accuracy of Fuzzy Conditional Random Fields is the best.","authors":["Intan Nurma","Atje Setiawan Abdullah"],"meta":["October 2017Journal of Physics Conference Series 893(1):012058","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/893/1/012058","Project: Ethnomathematics and Ethnoinformatics for Mapping of Indonesian Culture"],"references":["260419051_Fuzzy_Hidden_Markov_Models_For_Indonesian_Speech_Classification","259335281_A_Review_of_Temporal_Aspects_of_Hand_Gesture_Analysis_Applied_to_Discourse_Analysis_and_Natural_Conversation","228863941_A_Hidden_Markov_Model-Based_Isolated_and_Meaningful_Hand_Gesture_Recognition","3758723_Action_recognition_using_probabilistic_parsing","3335983_Designing_fuzzy_inference_systems_from_data_An_Interpret_ability-oriented_review","239061107_Classification_of_radar_returns_from_the_ionosphere_using_neural_networks","47817477_An_Introduction_to_Conditional_Random_Fields","44560480_Fundamentals_of_speech_recognition_Lawrence_Rabiner_Biing-_Hwang_Juang","2529190_Conditional_Random_Fields_Probabilistic_Models_for_Segmenting_and_Labeling_Sequence_Data"]}
