{"id":"261960018_Teaching_theoretical_computer_science_using_a_cognitive_apprenticeship_approach","abstract":"High failure rates in introductory courses on theoretical computer science are a common problem at universities in Germany, Europe, and North America, as students often have difficulties coping with the contents of such courses due to their abstract and theoretical nature. This paper describes modifications to the pedagogy of a theory course held at the University of Potsdam, Germany that are motivated by a cognitive apprenticeship approach and have led to a significant reduction of the course's failure rates. Since our approach is based on the typical infrastructure for teaching introductory computer science courses and does not require additional expenses or special resources, it can be replicated by other institutions. We believe that it is a serious contribution to better support teaching as well as student learning success in this field.","authors":["Maria Knobelsdorf","Christoph Kreitz","Sebastian BÃ¶hne"],"meta":["March 2014","DOI:10.1145/2538862.2538944","Conference: Proceedings of the 45th ACM technical symposium on Computer science education"],"references":["262407826_Learning_by_game-building_a_novel_approach_to_theoretical_computer_science_education","234827072_Instructional_design_of_a_programming_course_A_learning_theoretic_approach","234817982_Didactic_strategies_for_promoting_significant_learning_in_formal_languages_and_automata_theory","224757947_Problem-based_learning_of_theoretical_computer_science","312341372_Cognitive_apprenticeship_Making_thinking_visible","304436599_Cognitive_apprenticeship_Making_thinking_visible","285097764_Situated_Cognition_and_How_to_Overcome_It_in_Situated_Cognition_Social_Semiotic_Psychological_Perspectives_D_Kirshner_JA_Whitson_eds","250888348_Identifying_predictors_of_success_for_an_objects-first_CS1","228758380_Learning_edge_momentum_A_new_account_of_outcomes_in_CS1","221537199_Turning_automata_theory_into_a_hands-on_course"]}
