{"id":"313736599_Data-driven_system_to_predict_academic_grades_and_dropout","abstract":"Nowadays, the role of a tutor is more important than ever to prevent students dropout and improve their academic performance. This work proposes a data-driven system to extract relevant information hidden in the student academic data and, thus, help tutors to offer their pupils a more proactive personal guidance. In particular, our system, based on machine learning techniques, makes predictions of dropout intention and courses grades of students, as well as personalized course recommendations. Moreover, we present different visualizations which help in the interpretation of the results. In the experimental validation, we show that the system obtains promising results with data from the degree studies in Law, Computer Science and Mathematics of the Universitat de Barcelona.","authors":["Sergi Rovira","Eloi Puertas","Laura Igual"],"meta":["February 2017PLoS ONE 12(2):e0171207","DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0171207"],"references":["308412408_Imbalanced-learn_A_Python_Toolbox_to_Tackle_the_Curse_of_Imbalanced_Datasets_in_Machine_Learning","281634655_Computer-Tailored_Student_Support_in_Introductory_Physics","281345184_Permanencia_en_la_universidad_la_importancia_de_un_buen_comienzo","281345090_Prediccion_del_abandono_universitario_variables_explicativas_y_medidas_de_prevencion","340177686_Data_Structures_for_Statistical_Computing_in_Python","339500942_Collaborative_Filtering_Recommender_Systems","307175251_Induction_of_Decision_Trees","306199590_Research_and_practice_of_student_retention_What_next_Journal_of_College_Student_Retention_Research","303231742_Correlation_and_Simple_Linear_Regression","296951648_Evaluating_recommender_systems","279766351_Un_modelo_de_regresion_logistica_asimetrico_que_puede_explicar_la_probabilidad_de_exito_en_el_rendimiento_academico_2015_Revista_de_Investigacion_Educativa_331_27-45","268219655_Profiling_First-Year_Students_in_STEM_Programs_Based_on_Autonomous_Motivation_and_Academic_Self-Concept_and_Relationship_with_Academic_Achievement","270877801_A_Computer_Method_for_Calculating_Kendall's_Tau_with_Ungrouped_Data","269525975_Early_Prediction_of_Students'_Grade_Point_Averages_at_Graduation_A_Data_Mining_Approach","268998853_A_Computer_Method_for_Calculating_Kendall's_Tau_with_Ungrouped_Data"]}
