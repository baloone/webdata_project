{"id":"317431325_Multi-level_method_for_discovery_of_regional_co-location_patterns","abstract":"Regional co-location patterns represent subsets of feature types that are frequently located together in sub-regions in a study area. These sub-regions are unknown a priori, and instances of these co-location patterns are usually unevenly distributed across a study area. Regional co-location patterns remain challenging to discover. This study developed a multi-level method to identify regional co-location patterns in two steps. First, global co-location patterns were detected, and other non-prevalent co-location patterns were identified as candidates for regional co-location patterns. Second, an adaptive spatial clustering method was applied to detect the sub-regions where regional co-location patterns are prevalent. To improve computational efficiency, an overlap method was developed to deduce the sub-regions of (k + 1)-size co-location patterns from the sub-regions of k-size co-location patterns. Experiments based on both synthetic and ecological data sets showed that the proposed method is effective in the detection of regional co-location patterns.","authors":["Min Deng","Jiannan Cai","Qiliang Liu","zhanjun he"],"meta":["June 2017International Journal of Geographical Information Science 31(9):1-25","DOI:10.1080/13658816.2017.1334890"],"references":["319393723_Fast_algorithms_for_mining_association_rules","305978777_The_second-order_analysis_of_stationary_point_processes","284528486_Statistical_Analysis_of_Spatial_Point_Patterns","281665693_Principles_and_Conservation","274799972_Wetland_Ecology_Principles_and_Conservation","266660129_Mining_statistically_sound_co-location_patterns_at_multiple_distances","262343510_Mining_Statistically_Significant_Co-location_and_Segregation_Patterns","258163446_Mining_regional_co-location_patterns_with_kNNG","245865457_Density_based_clustering_in_spatial_databases","242529823_Fast_Algorithms_for_Mining_Association_Rules"]}
