{"id":"271077999_On_Real-Time_Performance_Evaluation_of_Volcano-Monitoring_Systems_With_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","abstract":"Volcanic eruption early warning has to be launched with effectiveness and within the shortest time possible, which imposes the requirement of using real-time (RT) systems. In this setting, volcano monitoring systems using wireless sensor networks (WSN) may play a key role. Previous works did not report detailed enough performance evaluation, in order to identify their main constraints as RT systems, either in simulation tools or in test-bed scenarios. The aim of this work was to identify the optimum number of sensors to be deployed a posteriori, based on simulation results considering throughput, packet loss, and end-to-end delay, as metrics to satisfy RT requirements. We corroborated the simulation results obtained by a test-bed deployment within a controlled environment. We determined that optimal scenario for volcano monitoring is random topology, and the results show that twelve nodes should be deployed as maximum to satisfy the RT constraints. To test the system in a real scenario, ten sensors were deployed in a strategic area at Cotopaxi Volcano, and information was collected during three days of continuous monitoring. This information was sent to a remote surveillance laboratory located 45 km away from the station placed at the volcano using WiFi-based long distance technology. Our study shows that the coordinator node is the main bottleneck in the real application scenario, given that its processing rate provokes an excessive time delay near to 3s, which has to be solved to satisfy RT requirements. We conclude that a comprehensive study including simulation, test-bed, and in-situ deployment provides valuable information for the specifications to be accounted in permanent WSN RT volcano monitoring.","authors":["Román Lara-Cueva","Diego Benitez","Antonio Caamaño","Marco Zennaro"],"meta":["January 2015IEEE Sensors Journal Vol. 15(Issue 6):3514-3523","DOI:10.1109/JSEN.2015.2393713","Projects: 2016-EXT-038 SRASI - Automatic recognition system of seismo-volcanic events2013-PIT-014 EWBS-WSN"],"references":["320955750_Analisis_del_desempeno_de_una_red_Ad-Hoc_inalambrica_movil_MANET_empleando_el_software_NS_232_bajo_el_estandar_IEEE_80215","290781259_Evaluatin_of_QoS_parameters_on_TCPIP_in_wireless_ad_hoc_networks","289701937_Cyber-physical_systems_-_Concept_challenges_and_research_areas","272490624_Performance_evaluation_of_a_volcano_monitoring_system_using_wireless_sensor_networks","260636604_Guest_Editorial_-_Special_Issue_on_Internet_of_Things_IoT_Architecture_Protocols_and_Services","255988679_Information_Abstraction_for_Heterogeneous_Real_World_Internet_Data","222571757_The_Internet_of_Things_A_Survey","222512266_Automatic_classification_and_a-posteriori_analysis_of_seismic_event_identification_at_Soufriere_Hills_volcano_Montserrat","221298888_Quality-Driven_Volcanic_Earthquake_Detection_Using_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","221234503_Air-dropped_Sensor_Network_for_Real-time_High-fidelity_Volcano_Monitoring","220851801_Fidelity_and_Yield_in_a_Volcano_Monitoring_Sensor_Network","220831943_WiLDNet_Design_and_Implementation_of_High_Performance_WiFi_Based_Long_Distance_Networks","29644849_Real-time_QoS_support_in_wireless_sensor_networks_A_survey","4152352_Monitoring_Volcanic_Eruptions_with_a_Wireless_Sensor_Network","3419815_Deploying_a_Wireless_Sensor_Network_on_an_Active_Volcano","277291738_REAL-TIME_WIRELESS_SENSOR_NETWORKS","271495001_Performance_evaluation_of_ZigBee-based_sensor_networks_using_empirical_measurements","269839342_Probability_Analysis_of_Channel_Collision_between_IEEE_802154_and_IEEE_80211b_Using_Qualnet_Simulation_for_Various_Topologies","262165430_Tutorial_personal_big_data_management_in_the_cyber-physical_systems_-_the_role_of_event_processing","261073937_Performance_and_evaluation_of_IEEE_802154_under_different_topologies_with_Ad-hoc_on_demand_distance_vector_protocol","260508371_A_Cyber_Physical_Test-Bed_for_Virtualization_of_RF_Access_Environment_for_Body_Sensor_Network","252052173_Tactics_of_handling_data_in_Internet_of_things","242202378_A_comprehensive_performance_study_of_IEEE_802154","228823366_Maximizing_throughput_in_ZigBee_wireless_networks_through_analysis_simulations_and_implementations","224712854_Performance_Evaluation_of_NS-2_Simulator_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","224645091_Performance_study_of_IEEE_802154_using_measurements_and_simulations","224171653_A_survey_of_simulators_emulators_and_testbeds_for_wireless_sensor_networks","224157144_Cyber-Physical_Systems_Close_Encounters_Between_Two_Parallel_Worlds_Point_of_View","223531376_Design_of_smart_sensing_components_for_volcano_monitoring","221251717_Performance_analysis_of_IEEE_802154_And_ZigBee_for_large-scale_wireless_sensor_network_applications","221194128_Performance_Modelling_of_IEEE_802154_MAC_in_LR-WPAN_with_Bursty_ON-OFF_Traffic","220747293_Calibrating_and_Comparing_Simulators_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","220294920_Design_and_Deployment_of_Sensor_Network_for_Real-Time_High-Fidelity_Volcano_Monitoring","220285202_QoS_analysis_of_medium_access_control_in_LR-WPANs_under_bursty_error_channels","220098198_Simulation_study_of_IEEE_802154_LR-WPAN_for_industrial_applications","201169371_Influence_of_volcanic_eruptions_on_Northern_Hemisphere_summer_temperature_over_the_past_600_years","30952688_Performance_evaluation_of_an_enhanced_GDCF_for_IEEE_80211","6940484_The_effects_and_consequences_of_very_large_explosive_volcanic_eruptions","4321667_Performance_evaluation_of_IEEE_802154_LR-WPAN_for_industrial_applications","3448081_The_Internet_of_things","3181457_Performance_evaluation_of_IEEE_802154_for_low-rate_wireless_personal_area_networks"]}
