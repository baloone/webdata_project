{"id":"309854723_When_Engagement_Meets_Similarity_Efficient_kr-Core_Computation_on_Social_Networks","abstract":"In this paper, we investigate the problem of (k,r)-core which intends to find cohesive subgraphs on social networks considering both user engagement and similarity perspectives. In particular, we adopt the popular concept of k-core to guarantee the engagement of the users (vertices) in a group (subgraph) where each vertex in a (k,r)-core connects to at least k other vertices. Meanwhile, we also consider the pairwise similarity between users based on their profiles. For a given similarity metric and a similarity threshold r, the similarity between any two vertices in a (k,r)-core is ensured not less than r. Efficient algorithms are proposed to enumerate all maximal (k,r)-cores and find the maximum (k,r)-core, where both problems are shown to be NP-hard. Effective pruning techniques significantly reduce the search space of two algorithms and a novel (k,k')-core based (k,r)-core size upper bound enhances performance of the maximum (k,r)-core computation. We also devise effective search orders to accommodate the different nature of two mining algorithms. Comprehensive experiments on real-life data demonstrate that the maximal/maximum (k,r)-cores enable us to find interesting cohesive subgraphs, and performance of two mining algorithms is significantly improved by proposed techniques.","authors":["Fan Zhang","Ying Zhang","Lu Qin","Wenjie Zhang"],"meta":["November 2016Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment 10(10)","DOI:10.14778/3115404.3115406"],"references":["315177005_Effective_community_search_over_large_spatial_graphs","278196766_Detecting_hot_topics_from_Twitter_A_multiview_approach","273057446_Diversified_Top-K_Clique_Search","263545405_Geo-Social_Group_Queries_with_Minimum_Acquaintance_Constraint","262425942_Arrival_and_departure_dynamics_in_social_networks","262166710_Preventing_Unraveling_in_Social_Networks_The_Anchored_k-Core_Problem","261849774_Large_scale_cohesive_subgraphs_discovery_for_social_network_visual_analysis","257428613_Fast_Maximal_Cliques_Enumeration_in_Sparse_Graphs","254464200_Fast_algorithms_for_maximal_clique_enumeration_with_limited_memory","254006433_A_model-based_approach_to_attributed_graph_clustering","224243258_ISCoDe_A_framework_for_interest_similarity-based_community_detection_in_social_networks","223986817_Structural_diversity_in_social_contagion","221660899_Mining_Attribute-structure_Correlated_Patterns_in_Large_AttributedGraphs","221657109_Mining_Email_social_networks","221654349_Fast_best-effort_pattern_matching_in_large_attributed_graphs","221391510_Network_game_design_hints_and_implications_of_player_interaction","221194601_Spectral_Clustering_in_Social-Tagging_Systems","220876011_Finding_Overlapping_Communities_in_Social_Networks","220489296_An_Om_Algorithm_for_Cores_Decomposition_of_Networks","50235477_Listing_All_Maximal_Cliques_in_Large_Sparse_Real-World_Graphs","45898153_Identification_of_influential_spreaders_in_complex_networks","315303792_OLAK_an_efficient_algorithm_to_prevent_unraveling_in_social_networks","313061622_Finding_all_cliques_of_an_undirected_graph_algorithm_457","307896708_Effective_community_search_for_large_attributed_graphs","304456772_IO_efficient_Core_Graph_Decomposition_at_web_scale","304021258_Truss_Decomposition_of_Probabilistic_Graphs_Semantics_and_Algorithms","301233247_Network_structure_and_minimum_degree","289547772_CAST_A_Context-Aware_Story-Teller_for_Streaming_Social_Content","289436295_PICS_Parameter-free_Identification_of_Cohesive_Subgroups_in_Large_Attributed_Graphs","285981181_Community_detection_based_on_structural_and_attribute_similarities","282955924_Finding_dense_and_connected_subgraphs_in_dual_networks","272148406_Attributed_Graph_Models_Modeling_network_structure_with_correlated_attributes","267395945_Locally_Estimating_Core_Numbers","266660366_Event_detection_in_activity_networks","266656598_Local_search_of_communities_in_large_graphs","262389796_Redundancy-aware_maximal_cliques","262293179_To_stay_or_not_to_stay_Modeling_engagement_dynamics_in_social_graphs","262176715_Towards_Realistic_Team_Formation_in_Social_Networks_based_on_Densest_Subgraphs","261253972_Keep_Your_Friends_Close_and_Your_Facebook_Friends_Closer_A_Multiplex_Network_Approach_to_the_Analysis_of_Offline_and_Online_Social_Ties","259933680_Community_Detection_in_Networks_with_Node_Attributes","236274304_Preventing_Unraveling_in_Social_Networks_Gets_Harder","236248384_Parameterized_Complexity_of_the_Anchored_k-Core_Problem_for_Directed_Graphs","234792391_The_Complexity_of_Near-Optimal_Graph_Coloring","228057735_Computers_And_Intractability_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness","224237578_Efficient_core_decomposition_in_massive_networks","200775192_Yes_There_Is_a_Correlation---From_Social_Networks_to_Personal_Behavior_on_the_Web"]}
