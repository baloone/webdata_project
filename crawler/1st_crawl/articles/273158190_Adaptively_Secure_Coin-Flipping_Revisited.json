{"id":"273158190_Adaptively_Secure_Coin-Flipping_Revisited","abstract":"The question of how much bias a coalition of faulty players can introduce into distributed sampling protocols in the full information model was first studied by Ben-Or and Linial in 1985. They focused on the problem of collective coin-flipping, in which a set of n players wish to use their private randomness to generate a common random bit b in the presence of t(n) faulty players, such that the probability that \\(b=0\\) (and 1) are at least \\(\\varepsilon \\) for some constant \\(\\varepsilon >0\\). They showed that the majority function can tolerate \\(t=\\Theta (\\sqrt{n})\\) corruptions even in the presence of adaptive adversaries and conjectured that this is optimal in the adaptive setting. Shortly thereafter, Lichtenstein, Linial, and Saks proved that the conjecture holds for protocols where each player sends a single bit. Their result has been the main progress on the conjecture for the last 30 years.","authors":["Shafi Goldwasser","Yael Tauman Kalai","Sunoo Park"],"meta":["March 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-3-662-47666-6_53","SourcearXiv","Conference: International Colloquium on Automata, Languages, and Programming"],"references":["220334128_Adaptively_Secure_Broadcast","245685841_Coin_Flipping_over_the_Telephone","244568677_Impossibility_of_BlackBox_Reduction_from_Non-Adaptively_to_Adaptively_Secure_Coin-Flipping","233822853_The_Theory_of_Games_and_Economic_Behavior","226124348_Some_extremal_problems_arising_from_discrete_control_processes","221591851_How_to_Play_any_Mental_Game_or_A_Completeness_Theorem_for_Protocols_with_Honest_Majority","216301157_Equilibrium_points_in_n-person_games_Proc_Natl_Acad_Sci_USA","4355049_Collective_coin_flipping_robust_voting_schemes_and_minima_of_Banzhaf_values","3832167_Noncryptographic_selection_protocols"]}
