{"id":"345890832_The_Asymptotics_of_the_Clustering_Transition_for_Random_Constraint_Satisfaction_Problems","abstract":"Random constraint satisfaction problems exhibit several phase transitions when their density of constraints is varied. One of these threshold phenomena, known as the clustering or dynamic transition, corresponds to a transition for an information theoretic problem called tree reconstruction. In this article we study this threshold for two CSPs, namely the bicoloring of k-uniform hypergraphs with a density α of constraints, and the q-coloring of random graphs with average degree c. We show that in the large k, q limit the clustering transition occurs for α=2k-1k(lnk+lnlnk+γd+o(1)), c=q(lnq+lnlnq+γd+o(1)), where γd is the same constant for both models. We characterize γd via a functional equation, solve the latter numerically to estimate γd≈0.871, and obtain an analytic lowerbound γd≥1+ln(2(2-1))≈0.812. Our analysis unveils a subtle interplay of the clustering transition with the rigidity (naive reconstruction) threshold that occurs on the same asymptotic scale at γr=1.","authors":["Louise Budzynski","Guilhem Semerjian"],"meta":["December 2020Journal of Statistical Physics 181(5)","DOI:10.1007/s10955-020-02635-8"],"references":["239524502_The_hard-core_model_on_random_graphs_revisited","236263987_Nonnormal_Small_Jump_Approximation_of_Infinitely_Divisible_Distributions","331359976_Biased_landscapes_for_random_constraint_satisfaction_problems","324932789_An_Introduction_to_Probability_Theory_and_its_Applications","318315872_Phase_transitions_in_the_q-coloring_of_random_hypergraphs","308980970_Reconstruction_of_colourings_without_freezing","268704372_An_introduction_to_probability_theory_and_its_applications_Vol_1_2_unveranderte_Aufl","267760132_Proof_of_the_Satisfiability_Conjecture_for_Large_k","266517844_Statistical_Physics_of_Spin_Glasses_and_Information_Processing-An_Introduction","239761530_The_freezing_threshold_for_k-colourings_of_a_random_graph","220345624_Survey_propagation_An_algorithm_for_satisfiability","230941441_A_selfconsistent_theory_of_localization","228436980_Ratio_of_The_Tail_of_An_Infinitely_Divisible_Distribution_on_The_Line_to_That_of_Its_Levy_Measure","228057735_Computers_And_Intractability_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness","45913051_Reconstruction_Threshold_for_the_Hardcore_Model"]}
