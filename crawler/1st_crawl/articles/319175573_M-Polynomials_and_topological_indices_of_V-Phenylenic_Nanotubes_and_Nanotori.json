{"id":"319175573_M-Polynomials_and_topological_indices_of_V-Phenylenic_Nanotubes_and_Nanotori","abstract":"V-Phenylenic nanotubes and nanotori are most comprehensively studied nanostructures due to widespread applications in the production of catalytic, gas-sensing and corrosion-resistant materials. Representing chemical compounds with M-polynomial is a recent idea and it produces nice formulas of degree-based topological indices which correlate chemical properties of the material under investigation. These indices are used in the development of quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs) in which the biological activity and other properties of molecules like boiling point, stability, strain energy etc. are correlated with their structures. In this paper, we determine general closed formulae for M-polynomials of V-Phylenic nanotubes and nanotori. We recover important topological degree-based indices. We also give different graphs of topological indices and their relations with the parameters of structures.","authors":["Young Chel Kwun","Mobeen Munir","Waqas Nazeer","Shazia RAFIQUE"],"meta":["December 2017Scientific Reports 7(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-017-08309-y"],"references":["312023559_Some_Computational_Aspects_of_Boron_Triangular_Nanotubes","311455848_M-Polynomial_and_Degree-Based_Topological_Indices_of_Polyhex_Nanotubes","310606373_Some_Invariants_of_Circulant_Graphs","309601538_M-Polynomials_and_Topological_Indices_of_Titania_Nanotubes","308490742_M-Polynomial_and_Related_Topological_Indices_of_Nanostar_Dendrimers","313603847_Some_properties_of_the_second_Zagreb_index","297477116_The_first_Zagreb_indices_30_years_after","290228089_Computing_GA_index_and_ABC_index_of_V_-_phenylenic_nanotube","285380950_Some_properties_of_the_Wiener_polynomial","284041589_An_updated_survey_on_the_Randic_index"]}
