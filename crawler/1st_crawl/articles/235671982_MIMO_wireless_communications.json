{"id":"235671982_MIMO_wireless_communications","abstract":"Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology constitutes a breakthrough in the design of wireless communication systems, and is already at the core of several wireless standards. Exploiting multi-path scattering, MIMO techniques deliver significant performance enhancements in terms of data transmission rate and interference reduction. This book is a detailed introduction to the analysis and design of MIMO wireless systems. Beginning with an overview of MIMO technology, the authors then examine the fundamental capacity limits of MIMO systems. Transmitter design, including precoding and space-time coding, is then treated in depth, and the book closes with two chapters devoted to receiver design. Written by a team of leading experts, the book blends theoretical analysis with physical insights, and highlights a range of key design challenges. It can be used as a textbook for advanced courses on wireless communications, and will also appeal to researchers and practitioners working on MIMO wireless systems.","authors":["Ezio Biglieri","Robert Calderbank","A.
