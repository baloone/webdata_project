{"id":"262164654_Information_Security_Awareness_Status_of_Business_College_Undergraduate_Students","abstract":"Because end users are often the weakest link in a security chain, students need to practice security controls properly to improve information security on campus. This study surveyed undergraduate students in a business college to investigate their understanding and attitudes toward information security. Survey findings show that college students understand most information security topics suggested by National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST Special Report 800-50. Universities should provide easily accessible security training programs for students. Practical suggestions are provided to encourage students to participate in security training to enhance their security awareness level.","authors":["Eyong B.
