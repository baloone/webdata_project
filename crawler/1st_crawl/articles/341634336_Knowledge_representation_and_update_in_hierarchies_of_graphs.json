{"id":"341634336_Knowledge_representation_and_update_in_hierarchies_of_graphs","abstract":"A mathematical theory is presented for the representation of knowledge in the form of a directed acyclic hierarchy of objects in a category where all paths between any given pair of objects are required to be equal. The conditions under which knowledge update, in the form of the sesqui-pushout rewriting of an object in a hierarchy, can be propagated to the rest of the hierarchy, in order to maintain all required path equalities, are analysed: some rewrites must be propagated forwards, in the direction of the arrows, while others must be propagated backwards, against the direction of the arrows, and, depending on the precise form of the hierarchy, certain composability conditions may also be necessary. The implementation of this theory, in the ReGraph Python library for (simple) directed graphs with attributes on nodes and edges, is then discussed in the context of two significant use cases.","authors":["Russ Harmer","Eugenia Oshurko"],"meta":["May 2020Journal of Logical and Algebraic Methods in Programming 114(1):100559","DOI:10.1016/j.jlamp.2020.100559"],"references":["266985489_Reversible_Sesqui-Pushout_Rewriting","220713448_Algebraic_Approaches_to_Graph_Transformation_-_Part_II_Single_Pushout_Approach_and_Comparison_with_Double_Pushout_Approach","220713318_Graph_Rewriting_in_Span-Categories","220713273_Sesqui-Pushout_Rewriting","2777413_Algebraic_Approaches_to_Graph_Transformation_Part_I_Basic_Concepts_and_Double_Pushout_Approach","336848836_Schema_Validation_and_Evolution_for_Graph_Databases","335848013_KAMIStudio_An_Environment_for_Biocuration_of_Cellular_Signalling_Knowledge","334135308_Knowledge_Representation_and_Update_in_Hierarchies_of_Graphs","331884936_Bio-Curation_for_Cellular_Signalling_The_KAMI_Project","325371427_Cypher_An_Evolving_Query_Language_for_Property_Graphs","242982550_Exponentiable_morphisms_partial_products_and_pullback_complements","221310691_The_Enity-Relationship_Model_Toward_a_Unified_View_of_Data"]}
