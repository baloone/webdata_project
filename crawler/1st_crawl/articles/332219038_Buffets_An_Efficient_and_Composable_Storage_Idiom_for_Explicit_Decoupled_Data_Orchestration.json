{"id":"332219038_Buffets_An_Efficient_and_Composable_Storage_Idiom_for_Explicit_Decoupled_Data_Orchestration","abstract":"Accelerators spend significant area and effort on custom on-chip buffering. Unfortunately, these solutions are strongly tied to particular designs, hampering re-usability across other accelerators or domains. We present buffets, an efficient and composable storage idiom for the needs of accelerators that is independent of any particular design. Buffets have several distinguishing characteristics, including efficient decoupled fills and accesses with fine-grained synchronization, hierarchical composition, and efficient multi-casting. We implement buffets in RTL and show that they only add 2% control overhead over an 8KB RAM. When compared with DMA-managed double-buffered scratchpads and caches across a range of workloads, buffets improve energy-delay-product by 1.53x and 5.39x, respectively.","authors":["Michael Pellauer","Yakun Sophia Shao","Jason Clemons","Neal Crago"],"meta":["April 2019","DOI:10.1145/3297858.3304025","Conference: the Twenty-Fourth International Conference"],"references":["324600006_UCNN_Exploiting_Computational_Reuse_in_Deep_Neural_Networks_via_Weight_Repetition","317613363_In-Datacenter_Performance_Analysis_of_a_Tensor_Processing_Unit","291342511_DeSC_decoupled_supply-compute_communication_management_for_heterogeneous_architectures","221628060_CACTI-P_Architecture-level_modeling_for_SRAM-based_structures_with_advanced_leakage_reduction_techniques","220938804_The_Scalable_HeterOgeneous_Computing_SHOC_benchmark_suite","345416673_Jenga_Software-Defined_Cache_Hierarchies","326565045_A_Configurable_Cloud-Scale_DNN_Processor_for_Real-Time_AI","326563222_UCNN_Exploiting_Computational_Reuse_in_Deep_Neural_Networks_via_Weight_Repetition","326561589_GANAX_A_Unified_MIMD-SIMD_Acceleration_for_Generative_Adversarial_Networks","325866762_A_modular_digital_VLSI_flow_for_high-productivity_SoC_design","323948054_MAERI_Enabling_Flexible_Dataflow_Mapping_over_DNN_Accelerators_via_Reconfigurable_Interconnects","319870251_Jenga_Software-Defined_Cache_Hierarchies","319859917_Plasticine_A_Reconfigurable_Architecture_For_Parallel_Paterns","319770323_EIE_Efficient_Inference_Engine_on_Compressed_Deep_Neural_Network","319770291_Very_Deep_Convolutional_Networks_for_Large-Scale_Image_Recognition","319135260_SCNN_An_Accelerator_for_Compressed-sparse_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","318125926_FP-DNN_An_Automated_Framework_for_Mapping_Deep_Neural_Networks_onto_FPGAs_with_RTL-HLS_Hybrid_Templates","317631934_Eyeriss_A_Spatial_Architecture_for_Energy-Efficient_Dataflow_for_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","317614154_Plasticine_A_Reconfigurable_Architecture_For_Parallel_Paterns","317613527_SCNN_An_Accelerator_for_Compressed-sparse_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","317611385_Stream-Dataflow_Acceleration","316902593_FlexFlow_A_Flexible_Dataflow_Accelerator_Architecture_for_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","312448985_DaDianNao_A_machine-learning_supercomputer","312288565_From_high-level_deep_neural_models_to_FPGAs","311756077_Co-designing_accelerators_and_SoC_interfaces_using_gem5-Aladdin","311755987_Efficient_data_supply_for_hardware_accelerators_with_prefetching_and_accessexecute_decoupling","311754406_A_patch_memory_system_for_image_processing_and_computer_vision","304340893_Shifting_Vision_Processing_Closer_to_the_Sensor_for_High_Efficiency","301891800_Eyeriss_A_Spatial_Architecture_for_Energy-Efficient_Dataflow_for_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","301819356_EIE_Efficient_Inference_Engine_on_Compressed_Deep_Neural_Network","301227588_C-BrainA_deep_learning_accelerator_that_tames_the_diversity_of_CNNs_through_adaptive_data-level_parallelization","295851086_Stash_Have_Your_Scratchpad_and_Cache_it_Too","283841538_An_Analysis_of_Accelerator_Coupling_in_Heterogeneous_Architectures","283024298_DaDianNao_A_Machine-Learning_Supercomputer","280082402_ShiDianNao_shifting_vision_processing_closer_to_the_sensor","277896547_PuDianNao_A_Polyvalent_Machine_Learning_Accelerator","275482077_Convolution_engine","271455545_Aladdin_A_pre-RTL_power-performance_accelerator_simulator_enabling_large_design_space_exploration_of_customized_architectures","266657370_Accelerator-Rich_Architectures_Opportunities_and_Progresses","265385906_Very_Deep_Convolutional_Networks_for_Large-Scale_Image_Recognition","262174473_Convolution_Engine_Balancing_Efficiency_and_Flexibility_in_Specialized_Computing","262164115_Q100_The_Architecture_and_Design_of_a_Database_Processing_Unit","261845797_DianNao_A_Small-Footprint_High-Throughput_Accelerator_for_Ubiquitous_Machine-Learning","242416526_Decoupled_accessexecute_architectures","224130594_The_GPU_computing_era","221224586_CoRAM_An_in-fabric_memory_architecture_for_FPGA-based_computing","221224418_Leap_scratchpads_Automatic_memory_and_cache_management_for_reconfigurable_logic","221060815_Buffer-Integrated-Cache_A_Cost-Effective_SRAM_Architecture_for_Handheld_and_Embedded_Platforms","220771927_Decoupled_accessexecute_computer_architectures","220439423_Decoupled_AccessExecute_Computer_Architectures","220013378_The_Accelerator_Store_A_Shared_Memory_Framework_For_Accelerator-Based_Systems","216792688_NeuFlow_A_Runtime-Reconfigurable_Dataflow_Processor_for_Vision","3883020_Synthesis_of_operation-centric_hardware_descriptions"]}
