{"id":"257674503_Joint_multi-radio_multi-channel_assignment_scheduling_and_routing_in_wireless_mesh_networks","abstract":"The IEEE 802.11 DCF and EDCA mechanisms based on CSMA/CA are the most widely used random channel access mechanisms in wireless mesh networks (WMNs), but unfortunately these cannot effectively eliminate hidden terminal and exposed terminal problems in multi-hop scenarios. In this paper, we propose a set of efficient multi-radio multi-channel (MRMC) assignment, scheduling and routing protocols based on Latin squares for WMNs with MRMC communication capabilities, called “M4”, i.e., the Multiple access scheduling in Multi-radio Multi-channel Mesh networking. M4 uses nodal interference information to form cliques for inter-cluster and intra-cluster inWMNs, and then applies Latin squares to map the clique-based clustering structure to radios and channels for communication purposes. Then, M4 again applies Latin squares to schedule the channel access among nodes within each cluster in a collision-free manner. From a systematic view, we also design the corresponding MRMC routing to support M4 communication. Extensive simulation results show that M4 achieves much better performance than IEEE 802.11 standards and other channel access control protocols.","authors":["Di Wu","Shih-Hsien Yang","Lichun Bao","Chi Harold Liu"],"meta":["January 2014Wireless Networks 20(1)","DOI:10.1007/s11276-013-0568-y"],"references":["275285223_A_General_Model_of_Wireless_Interference","221580898_Reducibility_Among_Combinatorial_Problems","221244973_Interference-Aware_Channel_Assignment_in_Multi-Radio_Wireless_Mesh_Networks","220747786_Topology_Control_and_Channel_Assignment_in_Multi-Radio_Multi-Channel_Wireless_Mesh_Networks","4334229_Distance-1_Constrained_Channel_Assignment_in_Single_Radio_Wireless_Mesh_Networks","4110067_Approximating_maximal_cliques_in_ad-hoc_networks","313196027_Reducibility_among_combinatorial_problems","310670788_Ad-hoc_on-demand_distance_vector_AODV_routing","263851435_Latin_Squares_and_Their_Applications","261341318_Geographic_load_balancing_routing_in_hybrid_Vehicular_Ad_Hoc_Networks","247393587_Request_for_Comments_Ad_hoc_on-demand_distance_vector_AODV_routing","245943644_Discrete_Mathematics_Using_Latin_Squares","243787873_Compexity_of_Computer_Computations","232645795_Connectivity-Based_k-Hop_Clustering_in_Wireless_Networks_PDF","224369177_Design_and_Evaluation_of_Localization_Protocols_and_Algorithms_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_Using_UWB","222813654_Wireless_Mesh_Networks_a_survey","222644906_Space-Bounded_Reducibility_among_Combinatorial_Problems","221628645_Multi-Channel_MAC_for_Ad_Hoc_Networks_Handling_Multi-Channel_Hidden_Terminals_Using_a_Single_Transceiver","220926734_Joint_channel_assignment_and_routing_for_throughput_optimization_in_multi-radio_wireless_mesh_networks","220293218_Flow_admission_control_for_multi-channel_multi-radio_wireless_Networks","220292947_Topology_control_for_multi-channel_multi-radio_wireless_mesh_networks_using_directional_antennas","220292506_Design_and_implementation_of_multicasting_for_multi-channel_multi-interface_wireless_mesh_networks","216720238_Wireless_Medium_Access_Control_MAC_and_Physical_Layer_PHY_specifications","4165149_MALS_multiple_access_scheduling_based_on_Latin_squares","4008213_How_effective_is_the_IEEE_80211_RTSCTS_handshake_in_ad_hoc_networks","3236418_Joint_Channel_Assignment_and_Routing_for_Throughput_Optimization_in_Multiradio_Wireless_Mesh_Networks","3080038_The_Capacity_of_Wireless_Networks"]}
