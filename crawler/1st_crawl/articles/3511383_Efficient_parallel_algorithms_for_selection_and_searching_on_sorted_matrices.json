{"id":"3511383_Efficient_parallel_algorithms_for_selection_and_searching_on_sorted_matrices","abstract":"Parallel algorithms for more general versions of the well known\nselection and searching problems are formulated. The authors look at\nthese problems when the set of elements can be represented as an n\n× n matrix with sorted rows and columns. The\nselection algorithm takes O (log n loglog n log*\nn ) time with O ( n /log n log*\nn ) processors on an EREW PRAM. The searching algorithm takes\nO (loglog n ) time with O ( n /loglog n\n) processors on a CREW PRAM, which is optimal. The authors also\nshow that no algorithm using at most n log<sup>c</sup> n\nprocessors, c &ges;1, can solve the matrix search problem\nin time faster than Ω(log log n )","authors":["Sarnath Ramnath","Xin He"],"meta":["April 1992","DOI:10.1109/IPPS.1992.223063","SourceIEEE Xplore","Conference: Parallel Processing Symposium, 1992.
