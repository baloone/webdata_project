{"id":"281806496_Practicing_and_Evaluating_Soft_Skills_in_IT_Capstone_Projects","abstract":"Information technology (IT) professionals have constantly stressed the importance of soft skills and used them as a key factor in hiring and career development. The soft skills are often difficult to be practiced and evaluated in IT curriculum, specifically in a subject or a skill focused course. We took on the challenge in an IT capstone course where students complete a term-long real-world team project. We re-designed the capstone course to systematically embed soft skill requirements in the capstone project, facilitate the development of soft skills, and finally evaluate students’ competences in terms of soft skills. In this paper, we present our experiences and findings on curriculum improvement and students’ soft skills development and assessment.","authors":["Jack G Zheng","Chi Zhang","Lei Li"],"meta":["September 2015","DOI:10.1145/2808006.2808041","Conference: The 16th Annual Conference on Information Technology Education (ACM SIGITE)At: CHICAGO, ILLINOIS"],"references":["282853470_Comparative_Analysis_of_Soft_Skills_What_is_Important_for_New_Graduates","267976461_Peer_Assessment_of_Soft_Skills_and_Hard_Skills","258126575_Executive_Perceptions_of_the_Top_10_Soft_Skills_Needed_in_Today's_Workplace","220590707_Critical_Skill_Sets_of_Entry-Level_IT_Professionals_An_Empirical_Examination_of_Perceptions_from_Field_Personnel","286969199_Knowledge_and_skill_requirements_for_entry-level_IT_workers_A_longitudinal_study","234663347_Knowledge_and_Skill_Requirements_for_Entry-Level_Information_Technology_Workers_A_Comparison_of_Industry_and_Academia","41936500_The_importance_of_soft_skills_Education_beyond_academic_knowledge"]}
