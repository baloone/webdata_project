{"id":"327837582_Explanation_for_Case-Based_Reasoning_via_Abstract_Argumentation","abstract":"Case-based reasoning (CBR) is extensively used in AI in support of several applications, to assess a new situation (or case) by recollecting past situations (or cases) and employing the ones most similar to the new situation to give the assessment. In this paper we study properties of a recently proposed method for CBR, based on instantiated Abstract Argumentation and referred to as AA-CBR, for problems where cases are represented by abstract factors and (positive or negative) outcomes, and an outcome for a new case, represented by abstract factors, needs to be established. In addition, we study properties of explanations in AA-CBR and define a new notion of lean explanations that utilize solely relevant cases. Both forms of explanations can be seen as dialogical processes between a proponent and an opponent, with the burden of proof falling on the proponent.","authors":["Kristijonas Cyras","Francesca Toni","Ken Satoh"],"meta":["September 2016","DOI:10.3233/978-1-61499-686-6-243","Conference: Computational Models of ArgumentAt: Potsdam, Germany"],"references":["268524868_Justifying_Answer_Sets_using_Argumentation","247391889_Representation_of_Case_Law_as_an_Argumentation_Framework","222820477_The_Carneades_Model_of_Argument_and_Burden_of_Proof","221539176_Case_law_in_extended_argumentation_frameworks","221539116_Legal_reasoning_with_argumentation_schemes","220637584_Explanation_in_Case-Based_Reasoning-Perspectives_and_Goals","220308924_Case-Based_Reasoning_An_Overview","327837566_Abstract_Argumentation_for_Case-Based_Reasoning","316806269_Case-Based_Reasoning","313555181_On_Explanations_for_Non-Acceptable_Arguments","292338853_Automated_Inference_of_Rules_with_Exception_from_Past_Legal_Cases_Using_ASP","288771302_On_computing_explanations_in_abstract_argumentation","288146967_Formal_arguments_preferences_and_natural_language_interfaces_to_humans_An_empirical_evaluation","285432624_On_the_acceptability_of_arguments_and_its_fundamental_role_in_nonmonotonic_reasoning_and_logic_programming","274150912_A_formalization_of_argumentation_schemes_for_legal_case-based_reasoning_in_ASPIC","257520565_A_factor-based_definition_of_precedential_constraint","257404849_Formalizing_dialectical_explanation_support_for_argument-based_reasoning_in_knowledge-based_systems","223206895_Computing_ideal_sceptical_argumentation","222823033_Dialectic_proof_procedures_for_assumption-based_admissible_argumentation","222403708_Weighted_argument_systems_Basic_definitions_algorithms_and_complexity_results","222234885_Using_background_knowledge_in_case-based_legal_reasoning_A_computational_model_and_an_intelligent_learning_environment","221539308_Predicting_Outcomes_of_Case-Based_Legal_Arguments","221393317_Abstract_Dialectical_Frameworks","220831542_Explaining_the_Pros_and_Cons_of_Conclusions_in_CBR","220693194_Modeling_legal_arguments_Reasoning_with_cases_and_hypotheticals","2452207_Teaching_Case-Based_Argumentation_Through_a_Model_and_Examples"]}
