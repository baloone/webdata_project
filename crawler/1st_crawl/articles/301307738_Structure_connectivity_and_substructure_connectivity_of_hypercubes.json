{"id":"301307738_Structure_connectivity_and_substructure_connectivity_of_hypercubes","abstract":"The connectivity of a network – the minimum number of nodes whose removal will disconnect the network – is directly related to its reliability and fault tolerability, hence an important indicator of the network's robustness. In this paper, we extend the notion of connectivity by introducing two new kinds of connectivity, called structure connectivity and substructure connectivity, respectively. Let H be a certain particular connected subgraph of G. The H-structure connectivity of graph G, denoted , is the cardinality of a minimal set of subgraphs in G, such that every is isomorphic to H, and F's removal will disconnect G. The H-substructure connectivity of graph G, denoted , is the cardinality of a minimal set of subgraphs , such that every is a connected subgraph of H, and F's removal will disconnect G. In this paper, we will establish both and for the hypercube and .","authors":["Cheng-Kuan Lin","Lili Zhang","Jianxi Fan","Dajin Wang"],"meta":["April 2016Theoretical Computer Science 634","DOI:10.1016/j.tcs.2016.04.014"],"references":["262275083_Embedding_geodesic_and_balanced_cycles_into_hypercubes","222442815_A_Survey_of_the_Theory_of_Hypercube_Graphs","220185761_On_the_extraconnectivity_of_graphs","3299614_The_crossed_cube_architecture_for_parallel_computing","3044866_Conditional_diagnosability_measures_for_large_multiprocessor_systems","3043255_Conditional_Connectivity_Measures_for_Large_Multiprocessor_Systems","272612985_The_Conditional_Connectivity_of_nk_-Star_Graph","257586038_On_the_maximum_number_of_fault-free_mutually_independent_Hamiltonian_cycles_in_the_faulty_hypercube","256744864_2323-Extraconnectivities_of_hypercube-like_networks","256721525_A_kind_of_conditional_conneCtivity_of_Cayley_graphs_generated_by_unicyclic_graphs","229530874_Conditional_connectivity","222767739_On_Computing_a_Conditional_Edge-Connectivity_of_a_Graph","220557084_Restricted_connectivity_for_three_families_of_interconnection_networks","220378998_the_Twisted_Cube_Topology_for_Multiprocessors_A_Study_in_Network_Asymmetry","220318681_Extraconnectivity_of_hypercubes_II","220275781_Embedding_paths_of_variable_lengths_into_hypercubes_with_conditional_link-faults","220193997_Super_restricted_edge-connectivity_of_vertex-transitive_graphs","220115681_Unidirectional_Star_Graphs","220089072_A_note_on_fault-free_mutually_independent_Hamiltonian_cycles_in_hypercubes_with_faulty_edges","3238485_Optical_multi-mesh_hypercube_a_scalable_optical_interconnection_network_for_massively_parallel_computing","3042531_Generalized_measure_of_fault_tolerance_with_application_to_N-cubes"]}
