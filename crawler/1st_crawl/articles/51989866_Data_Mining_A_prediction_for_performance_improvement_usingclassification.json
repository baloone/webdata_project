{"id":"51989866_Data_Mining_A_prediction_for_performance_improvement_usingclassification","abstract":"Now-a-days the amount of data stored in educational database increasing\nrapidly. These databases contain hidden information for improvement of\nstudents' performance. The performance in higher education in India is a\nturning point in the academics for all students. This academic performance is\ninfluenced by many factors, therefore it is essential to develop predictive\ndata mining model for students' performance so as to identify the difference\nbetween high learners and slow learners student. In the present investigation,\nan experimental methodology was adopted to generate a database. The raw data\nwas preprocessed in terms of filling up missing values, transforming values in\none form into another and relevant attribute/ variable selection. As a result,\nwe had 300 student records, which were used for by Byes classification\nprediction model construction. Keywords- Data Mining, Educational Data Mining,\nPredictive Model, Classification.","authors":["Brijesh Kumar Bhardwaj","Saurabh Pal"],"meta":["January 2012International Journal of Computer Science and Information Security, 9(4)","SourcearXiv"],"references":["288835251_Data_Mining-_Introductory_and_Advanced_Topics","242472530_Examining_online_learning_processes_based_on_log_files_analysis_A_ca_se_study","242076740_Mining_Student_Data_Using_Decision_Trees","228571634_Mining_Students_Data_to_Analyze_Learning_Behavior_A_Case_Study","51989865_Mining_Educational_Data_to_Analyze_Students'_Performance","51888590_A_Data_Mining_view_on_Class_Room_Teaching_Language","51888589_Data_Mining_A_prediction_of_performer_or_underperformer_usingclassification","44839572_The_Shadow_education_system_private_tutoring_and_its_implications_for_planners","242396122_Data_mining_concepts_and_techniques_morgan_kaufmann","227458458_Principles_of_Data_Mining"]}
