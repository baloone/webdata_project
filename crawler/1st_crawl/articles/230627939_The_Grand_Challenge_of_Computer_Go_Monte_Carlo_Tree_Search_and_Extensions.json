{"id":"230627939_The_Grand_Challenge_of_Computer_Go_Monte_Carlo_Tree_Search_and_Extensions","abstract":"The ancient oriental game of Go has long been considered a grand challenge for artificial intelligence. For decades, computer Go has defied the classical methods in game tree search that worked so successfully for chess and checkers. How- ever, recent play in computer Go has been transformed by a new paradigm for tree search based on Monte-Carlo methods. Programs based on Monte-Carlo tree search now play at human-master levels and are beginning to challenge top professional players. In this paper we describe the leading algorithms for Monte-Carlo tree search and explain how they have advanced the state of the art in computer Go.","authors":["Sylvain Gelly","Levente Kocsis","Marc Schoenauer","Mich√®le Sebag"],"meta":["March 2012Communications of the ACM 55(3):106-113","DOI:10.1145/2093548.2093574"],"references":["279900356_Online_Optimization_in_X-Armed_Bandits","238378872_Modification_of_UCT_with_Patterns_in_Monte-Carlo_Go","224212438_Special_Issue_on_Monte_Carlo_Techniques_and_Computer_Go","224083400_A_study_on_security_evaluation_methodology_for_image-based_biometrics_authentication_systems","251905774_Using_a_Monte-Carlo_approach_for_Bus_regulation","239292007_Asymptotically_efficient_adaptive_allocation_rules1","237415931_Online_Optimization_inX_Armed_Bandits","228581647_Monte_carlo_go","222194173_The_games_computers_and_people_play","221607052_Optimal_Unbiased_Estimators_for_Evaluating_Agent_Performance"]}
