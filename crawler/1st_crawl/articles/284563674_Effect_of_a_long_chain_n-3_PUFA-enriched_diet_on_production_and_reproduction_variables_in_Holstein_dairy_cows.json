{"id":"284563674_Effect_of_a_long_chain_n-3_PUFA-enriched_diet_on_production_and_reproduction_variables_in_Holstein_dairy_cows","abstract":"The objective of this study was to determine the effect of a rumen-protected fish oil supplement on the production and reproduction variables in postpartum dairy cows. Holstein cows (n=46) were given a basal total mixed diet plus one PUFA supplement: n-3 (n-3; protected fish oil; 1% dry matter intake (DMI); n=23) or control (n-6; toasted soybeans; 1.8% DMI; n=23), in a switchback design over two consecutive lactations. Supplements were added to the diet between calving and 2 months after calving to assess the effect on growth and maturation of ovarian follicles from which ovulation occurred around the day of insemination. Body weight (BW), milk yield (MY) and composition, dry matter intake (DMI), energy balance (EB), subcutaneous fat thickness, plasma fatty acid composition, plasma nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), glucose and urea concentrations, follicular activity, embryo mortalities and fertility (conception rate after first AI, AI1) were assessed. BW, MY, DMI, plasma NEFA, glucose and urea were unaffected by the diet. There was a trend of an increased number of large follicles (diameterâ‰¥10mm) with the n-3 dietary supplementation (P=0.06) and a decrease in infertility or early embryo mortality rate 21 days after AI, 13.5% in the n-3 compared with 38.8% in the n-6 group (P=0.09), with no effect on the conception rate at 35d or 90d after AI1. These data suggest that the effect seen on ovarian variables is not associated with an effect on production and metabolic variables and is specific to n-3 PUFA supplementation. Further studies are necessary to determine whether DHA or EPA enhances fertility in lactating dairy cattle.","authors":["Sebastien Elis","Sandrine Freret","Alice Desmarchais","Virginie Maillard"],"meta":["November 2015Animal Reproduction Science 164","DOI:10.1016/j.anireprosci.2015.11.020","Project: N-3 PUFA effects on dairy cows reproduction"],"references":["273776955_Lipid_Mediators_Are_Critical_in_Resolving_Inflammation_A_Review_of_the_Emerging_Roles_of_Eicosanoids_in_Diabetes_Mellitus","268691528_Effect_of_dietary_starch_concentration_and_fish_oil_supplementation_on_milk_yield_and_composition_diet_digestibility_and_methane_emissions_in_lactating_dairy_cows","257072518_The_Interplay_between_Circadian_System_Cholesterol_Synthesis_and_Steroidogenesis_Affects_Various_Aspects_of_Female_Reproduction","256984988_Dietary_alpha-linolenic_acid_ALA_from_flaxseed_oil_improved_folliculogenesis_and_IVF_performance_in_dairy_cows_similarly_to_eicosapentaenoic_EPA_and_docosahexaenoic_DHA_acids_from_fish_oil","250381125_Effect_of_fish_oil_and_monensin_on_milk_composition_in_dairy_cows","291137456_Importance_de_la_nature_des_graisses_alimentaires_sur_la_reproduction_des_vaches_laitieres","288490791_Erratum_Extremely_limited_synthesis_of_long-chain_polyunsaturates_in_adults_implications_for_their_dietary_essentiality_and_use_as_supplements","287104224_Validation_d'une_methode_immunoenzymatique_pour_le_dosage_de_la_progesterone_dans_le_plasma_des_ovins_et_des_bovins","262989594_Effect_of_the_type_of_dietary_fatty_acid_alpha-linolenic_acid_or_linoleic_acid_on_the_number_and_the_quality_of_oocytes_collected_by_ovum_pickup_and_on_in_vitro_embryo_production_by_dairy_heifers","261410946_Dietary_Fat_Supplementation_and_the_Consequences_for_Oocyte_and_Embryo_Quality_Hype_or_Significant_Benefit_for_Dairy_Cow_Reproduction"]}
