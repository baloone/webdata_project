{"id":"311215827_Praticas_de_Monitoramento_Cognitivo_em_Atividades_de_Modelagem_Matematica","abstract":"This article refers to a research that aims to identify, about student manifestations while developing Mathematical Modeling activities, forms of cognitive monitoring and characterizing elements of Modeling activities that promote this monitoring of students. The data analyzed consist of students speeches saved into audio during the development of activities, of the produced records to do the resolutions and of the researcher's field diary notes. What can be concluded is that in Mathematical Modeling the monitoring practices are held collectively, are learned in the interactions among the different things involved with the activities and raised by them, in this article, we named as uniqueness of modeling activities, which refers to the constant practice of analyzing the development of the activity, considering it in its totality.","authors":["Rodolfo Eduardo Vertuan","Lourdes Maria Werle de Almeida"],"meta":["December 2016Bolema Boletim de Educação Matemática 30(56):1070-1091","DOI:10.1590/1980-4415v30n56a12"],"references":["317528978_Metacognicion_y_aprendizaje_estrategico","250984421_Taxonomia_de_Bloom_revisao_teorica_e_apresentacao_das_adequacoes_do_instrumento_para_definicao_de_objetivos_instrucionais","28230589_Modelo_metacognitivo_como_integrador_de_estrategias_de_ensenanza_y_estrategias_de_aprendizaje_de_las_ciencias_y_su_relacion_con_las_competencias","232599909_Metacognition_and_Cognitive_Monitoring_A_New_Area_of_Cognitive-Developmental_Inquiry","225383054_The_role_of_metacognitive_monitoring_in_explaining_differences_in_mathematics_achievement"]}
