{"id":"350545256_Roll_of_Test_Cases_in_Software_Testing","abstract":"One of the main important part of computer science is software engineering. Software engineering is the process of making software to ease the work of humans and give solutions and speedup some tasks. When software is prepared it go through many phases called life cycle of the software. After completion of software, testing is the important and critical part through which we can remove error cases and bugs. Generation of test cases can be optimized, if pure, bug free code is tested. Pure code uses less memory allocation and fast execution speed. good test cases have the ability to identify critical domain specific requirements. many techniques can be considered to generate test cases.","authors":["Dr. kavita"],"meta":["April 2021Journal of Advanced Research in Dynamical and Control Systems 12(3):17-20","Project: computer science"],"references":["268335425_Automated_Test_Data_Generation_Based_On_Individual_Constraints_and_Boundary_Value","282925970_Test_case_generation_and_prioritization_based_on_UML_behavioral_models"]}
