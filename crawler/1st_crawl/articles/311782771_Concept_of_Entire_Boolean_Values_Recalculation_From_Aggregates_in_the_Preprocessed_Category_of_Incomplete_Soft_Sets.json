{"id":"311782771_Concept_of_Entire_Boolean_Values_Recalculation_From_Aggregates_in_the_Preprocessed_Category_of_Incomplete_Soft_Sets","abstract":"Soft set is a mathematical tool for dealing with vague and imprecise data. It is used in many applications and decision-making after representing the uncertain data in the Boolean-valued information system (BIS). BISs become incomplete because of various reasons, such as security, viral attack, and errors. Several soft set-based approaches exist to handle incomplete BISs for decision-making. These approaches are categorized into two categories: preprocessed (PP) and unprocessed (UP). UP approaches cannot be used for the recalculation of overall missing values. Meanwhile, PP approaches can be extended to calculate the entire missing values. This study presents the basic concept of actual technique and initially applies it to the PP incomplete soft set. This novel concept will open a new chapter for researchers in the development of applications in the fields of mathematics, especially in Boolean data, discrete mathematics, and computer science.","authors":["Muhammad Sadiq Khan","Tutut Herawan","Ainuddin Wahid","Ghulam Mujtaba"],"meta":["December 2016IEEE Access PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2641982","Project: Medical Text Classification"],"references":["311711865_Virtual_Community_Detection_Through_the_Association_between_Prime_Nodes_in_Online_Social_Networks_and_Its_Application_to_Ranking_Algorithms","306129967_An_alternative_data_filling_approach_for_prediction_of_missing_data_in_soft_sets_ADFIS","258396905_Multiaspect_Soft_Sets","257869504_Application_of_soft_sets_to_diagnose_the_prostate_cancer_risk","257391729_A_novel_soft_set_approach_in_selecting_clustering_attribute","320006710_Applications_of_soft_sets_in_ideal_theory_of_BCKBCI-algebras","265491246_DFIS_A_novel_data_filling_approach_for_an_incomplete_soft_set","262252916_MAR_Maximum_Attribute_Relative_of_soft_set_for_clustering_attribute_selection","260802925_An_efficient_decision_making_approach_in_incomplete_soft_set","258653860_Soft_Set-Based_Decision_Making_for_Patients_Suspected_Influenza-Like_Illness"]}
