{"id":"223699090_The_impact_of_individual_differences_on_the_equivalence_of_computer-based_and_paper-and-pencil_educational_assessments","abstract":"Computer-based assessment (CBA) is yet to have a significant impact on high-stakes educational assessment, but the equivalence between CBA and paper-and-pencil (P&P) test scores will become a central concern in education as CBA increases. It is argued that as CBA and P&P tests provide test takers with qualitatively different experiences, the impact of individual differences on the testing experience, and so statistical equivalence of scores, needs to be considered. As studies of score equivalence have largely ignored individual differences such as computer experience, computer anxiety and computer attitudes, the purpose of this paper is to highlight the potential effects of these. It is concluded that each of these areas is of significance to the study of equivalence and that the often inconsistent findings result from the rapid changes in exposure to technology.","authors":["Angus S McDonald"],"meta":["November 2002Computers & Education
