{"id":"290855401_Improving_Simple_Collaborative_Filtering_Models_Using_Ensemble_Methods","abstract":"In this paper we examine the effect of applying ensemble learning to the performance of collaborative filtering methods. We present several systematic approaches for generating an ensemble of collaborative filtering models based on a single collaborative filtering algorithm (single-model or homogeneous ensemble). We present an adaptation of several popular ensemble techniques in machine learning for the collaborative filtering domain, including bagging, boosting, fusion and randomness injection. We evaluate the proposed approach on several types of collaborative filtering base models: k-NN, matrix factorization and a neighborhood matrix factorization model. Empirical evaluation shows a prediction improvement compared to all base CF algorithms. In particular, we show that the performance of an ensemble of simple (weak) CF models such as k-NN is competitive compared with a single strong CF model (such as matrix factorization) while requiring an order of magnitude less computational cost.","authors":["Ariel Bar","Lior Rokach","Guy Shani","Bracha Shapira"],"meta":["May 2013","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-38067-9_1","Conference: International Workshop on Multiple Classifier Systems"],"references":["263377228_Hybrid_Recommender_Systems_Survey_and_Experiments","222573328_Stochastic_Gradient_Boosting","221654586_Combining_predictions_for_accurate_recommender_systems","221338420_Designing_Specific_Weighted_Similarity_Measures_to_Improve_Collaborative_Filtering_Systems","221001715_Imputation-boosted_collaborative_filtering_using_machine_learning_classifiers","220499818_Experiments_with_AdaBoostRT_an_Improved_Boosting_Scheme_for_Regression","220320405_Scalable_Collaborative_Filtering_Approaches_for_Large_Recommender_Systems","2434797_Analysis_of_Recommendation_Algorithms_for_E-Commerce","2369002_Item-based_Collaborative_Filtering_Recommendation_Algorithms","237536819_Experiments_with_a_New_Boosting_Algorithm_DRAFT_-_PLEASE_DO_NOT_DISTRIBUTE","228807187_Collaborative_filtering_via_ensembles_of_matrix_factorizations","223037132_Two-way_cooperative_prediction_for_collaborative_filtering_recommendations","221654609_Factorization_meets_the_neighborhood_A_multifaceted_collaborative_filtering_model","220520181_Lessons_from_the_Netflix_prize_challenge","38348679_Heuristics_of_Instability_and_Stabilization_in_Model_Selection_The_Annals_of_Statistics_246_2350-2383","4324233_Scalable_Collaborative_Filtering_with_Jointly_Derived_Neighborhood_Interpolation_Weights","2792539_Human_Expert-Level_Performance_on_a_Scientific_Image_Analysis_Task_by_a_System_Using_Combined_Artificial_Neural_Networks"]}
