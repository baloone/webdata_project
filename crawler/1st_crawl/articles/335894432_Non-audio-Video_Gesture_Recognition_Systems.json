{"id":"335894432_Non-audio-Video_Gesture_Recognition_Systems","abstract":"Gesture recognition as a topic in computer science and language technology has the goal of interpreting human gestures via mathematical algorithms. Gestures can originate from any bodily motion or state but commonly originate from the face or hand. Gesture recognition enables humans to communicate with the machine and interact naturally without any mechanical devices. This paper investigates the possibility to use non-audio/video sensors to design a low-cost gesture recognition device that can be connected to any computer on the market. The paper proposes an equation that relates the distance and voltage for a Sharp GP2Y0A21 and GP2D120 sensors in the situation that a hand is used as the reflective object. In the end, the presented system is compared with other audio/video system that exist on the market. Also, future research is shown of a glove-like device for sign-language translation.","authors":["Razvan Craciunescu"],"meta":["January 2020Wireless Personal Communications 110(5)","DOI:10.1007/s11277-019-06757-5"],"references":["263854106_Hand_gesture_recognition_using_two_differential_PIR_sensors_and_a_camera","260349786_Robust_Part-Based_Hand_Gesture_Recognition_Using_Kinect_Sensor","283032149_Wireless_ZigBee_home_automation_system","277968623_eWALL_An_Intelligent_Caring_Home_Environment_Offering_Personalized_Context-Aware_Applications_Based_on_Advanced_Sensing","261846309_Kinect_Based_Dynamic_Hand_Gesture_Recognition_Algorithm_Research","241170827_A_Method_of_Hand_Gesture_Recognition_Based_on_Multiple_Sensors"]}
