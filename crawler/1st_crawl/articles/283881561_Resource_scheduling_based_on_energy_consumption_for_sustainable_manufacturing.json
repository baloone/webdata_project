{"id":"283881561_Resource_scheduling_based_on_energy_consumption_for_sustainable_manufacturing","abstract":"The paper proposes an agent-based approach for measuring in real time energy consumption of resources in job-shop manufacturing processes. Data from industrial robots is collected, analysed and assigned to operation types, and then integrated in an optimization engine in order to estimate how alternating between makespan and energy consumption as objective functions affects the performances of the whole system. This study focuses on the optimization of energy consumption in manufacturing processes through operation scheduling on available resources. The decision making algorithm relies on a decentralized system collecting data about resources implementing thus an intelligent manufacturing control system; the optimization problem is implemented using IBM ILOG OPL.","authors":["Silviu Raileanu","Florin Anton","Alexandru Iatan","Theodor Borangiu"],"meta":["August 2015Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing 28(7)","DOI:10.1007/s10845-015-1142-5"],"references":["261477564_Energy_Consumption_and_Dynamic_Behavior_Analysis_of_a_Six-axis_Industrial_Robot_in_an_Assembly_System","257581276_Efficient_metaheuristics_for_pick_and_place_robotic_systems_optimization","225555376_Planning_and_scheduling_teams_of_skilled_workers","220668856_A_Computational_Study_of_the_Job-Shop_Scheduling_Problem","289211794_Services_for_Competitive_and_Sustainable_Manufacturing_in_the_Smart_Grid","283310599_Simulation_Modelling_of_Energy_Dynamics_in_Discrete_Manufacturing_Systems","278691205_Sustainability_in_Manufacturing_Operations_Scheduling_Stakes_Approaches_and_Trends","271574297_Optimization_of_machining_processes_from_the_perspective_of_energy_consumption_A_case_study","271391010_Optimization_of_cutting_parameters_for_minimizing_power_consumption_and_maximizing_tool_life_during_machining_of_Al_alloy_SiC_particle_composites","269294729_ILOG-based_mixed_planning_and_scheduling_system_for_job-shop_manufacturing","262019261_Assessing_Power_Monitoring_Approaches_for_Energy_and_Power_Analysis_of_Computers","260480018_Smart_meters_for_power_grid_-_Challenges_issues_advantages_and_status","260190008_Fast_Reactive_Scheduling_to_Minimize_Tardiness_Penalty_and_Energy_Cost_Under_Power_Consumption_Uncertainties","259623342_Integrated_scheduling_of_resource-constrained_flexible_manufacturing_systems_using_constraint_programming","259510195_Reactive_and_energy-aware_scheduling_of_flexible_manufacturing_systems_using_potential_fields","257581070_Distributed_manufacturing_control_with_extended_CNP_interaction_of_intelligent_products","257516273_Flow_shop_scheduling_with_peak_power_consumption_constraints","257403005_A_fuzzy_logic_approach_to_forecast_energy_consumption_change_in_a_manufacturing_system","257400637_A_method_for_reducing_the_energy_consumption_of_pick-and-place_industrial_robots","247732242_Dynamic_speed_control_of_a_machine_tool_with_stochastic_tool_life_analysis_and_simulation_Journal_of_Intelligent_Manufacturing","241330178_Electric_Power_Systems_Quality","225249701_Optimizing_Energy_Costs_by_Intelligent_Production_Scheduling","4377722_Instantaneous_Power_Theory_and_Applications_to_Power_Conditioning"]}
