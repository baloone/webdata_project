{"id":"280217975_Design_of_a_Microlecture_Mobile_Learning_System_Based_on_Smartphone_and_Web_Platforms","abstract":"This paper first analyzes the concept and features of microlecture, mobile learning, and ubiquitous learning, then presents the combination of microlecture and mobile learning, to propose a novel way of micro-learning through mobile terminals. Details are presented of a microlecture mobile learning system (MMLS) that can support multiplatforms, including PC terminals and smartphones. The system combines intelligent push, speech recognition, video annotation, Lucene full-text search, clustering analysis, Android development, and other technologies. The platform allows learners to access microlecture videos and other high-quality microlecture resources wherever and whenever they like, in whatever time intervals they have available. Teachers can obtain statistical analysis results of the microlecture in MMLS to provide teaching/learning feedback and an effective communication platform. MMLS promotes the development of microlecture and mobile learning. A statistical analysis of the implementation of the system shows that students using MMLS to assist their learning had improved results on their final exams and gave a higher evaluation of the curriculum than those who did not. The advantages and disadvantages of MMLS are also analyzed.","authors":["Chuanxue Wen","Junfei Zhang"],"meta":["November 2014IEEE Transactions on Education 58(3):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TE.2014.2363627"],"references":["260606668_Adult_learners'_intention_to_adopt_mobile_learning_A_motivational_perspective","248078115_Little_Lectures","222412984_Community_of_inquiry_as_a_theoretical_framework_to_foster_epistemic_engagement_and_cognitive_presence_in_online_education","221572702_Correlative_multi-label_video_annotation","50224316_Universal_Instructional_Design_Principles_for_Mobile_Learning","350686928_39_Microlectures_In_Proximity_of_Performance","291318259_Towards_mobile_personalized_learning_management_systems","278649871_A_New_Mobile_Learning_Platform_Based_on_Mobile_Cloud_Computing","260587283_SyRoTek-Distance_Teaching_of_Mobile_Robotics","257171376_Mobile_learning_technology_based_on_iOS_devices_to_support_students_with_special_education_needs","254245599_Critical_issues_of_m-learning_Design_models_adoption_processes_and_future_trends","251979278_Application_of_WinCC_Software_to_Building_Automation_System","232638936_Adaptive_Content_Delivery_in_Ubiquitous_Learning_Environment","231262496_A_60-second_course_in_organic_chemistry","3181032_An_intelligent_push_system_for_mobile_clients_with_wireless_information_appliances"]}
