{"id":"258884473_The_Limits_of_Depth_Reduction_for_Arithmetic_Formulas_It's_All_About_the_Top_Fan-In","abstract":"In recent years, a very exciting and promising method for proving lower\nbounds for arithmetic circuits has been proposed. This method combines the\nmethod of {\\it depth reduction} developed in the works of Agrawal-Vinay [AV08],\nKoiran [Koi12] and Tavenas [Tav13], and the use of the shifted partial\nderivative complexity measure developed in the works of Kayal [Kay12] and Gupta\net al [GKKS13a]. These results inspired a flurry of other beautiful results and\nstrong lower bounds for various classes of arithmetic circuits, in particular a\nrecent work of Kayal et al [KSS13] showing superpolynomial lower bounds for\n{\\it regular} arithmetic formulas via an {\\it improved depth reduction} for\nthese formulas. It was left as an intriguing question if these methods could\nprove superpolynomial lower bounds for general (homogeneous) arithmetic\nformulas, and if so this would indeed be a breakthrough in arithmetic circuit\ncomplexity.\nIn this paper we study the power and limitations of depth reduction and\nshifted partial derivatives for arithmetic formulas. We do it via studying the\nclass of depth 4 homogeneous arithmetic circuits. We show: (1) the first {\\it\nsuperpolynomial lower bounds} for the class of homogeneous depth 4 circuits\nwith top fan-in $o(\\log n)$. The core of our result is to show {\\it improved\ndepth reduction} for these circuits. (2) We show that improved depth reduction\n{\\it is not possible} when the top fan-in is $\\Omega(\\log n)$. In particular\nthis shows that the depth reduction procedure of Koiran and Tavenas [Koi12,\nTav13] cannot be improved even for homogeneous formulas, thus strengthening the\nresults of Fournier et al [FLMS13] who showed that depth reduction is tight for\ncircuits, and answering some of the main open questions of [KSS13, FLMS13].","authors":["Mrinal Kumar","Shubhangi Saraf"],"meta":["November 2013Proceedings of the Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing 44(6)","DOI:10.1145/2591796.2591827","SourcearXiv"],"references":["239761526_Reconstruction_of_depth-4_multilinear_circuits_with_top_fan-in_2","221590134_Deterministic_Identity_Testing_of_Depth-4_Multilinear_Circuits_with_Bounded_Top_Fan-in","220365641_Arithmetic_Circuits_A_survey_of_recent_results_and_open_questions","2413379_Depth-3_Arithmetic_Circuits_over_Fields_of_Characteristic_Zero","2241304_An_Exponential_Lower_Bound_for_Depth_3_Arithmetic_Circuits","288149370_A_super-polynomial_lower_bound_for_regular_arithmetic_formulas","261469588_Approaching_the_Chasm_at_Depth_Four","261054521_Arithmetic_Circuits_A_Chasm_at_Depth_Three","255687476_Depth-4_Lower_Bounds_Determinantal_Complexity_A_Unified_Approach","236248292_Improved_Bounds_for_Reduction_to_Depth_4_and_Depth_3","224354119_Arithmetic_Circuits_A_Chasm_at_Depth_Four","221591597_Completeness_Classes_in_Algebra","220617287_Fast_Parallel_Computation_of_Polynomials_Using_Few_Processors","220268344_Black-box_identity_testing_of_depth-4_multilinear_circuits","220138686_Deterministic_identity_testing_of_depth_4_multilinear_circuits_with_bounded_top_fan-in","45925555_Arithmetic_circuits_The_chasm_at_depth_four_gets_wider","3635348_Lower_Bounds_on_Arithmetic_Circuits_via_Partial_Derivatives"]}
