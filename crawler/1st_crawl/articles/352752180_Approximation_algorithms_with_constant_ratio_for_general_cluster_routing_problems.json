{"id":"352752180_Approximation_algorithms_with_constant_ratio_for_general_cluster_routing_problems","abstract":"Due to their ubiquity and extensive applications, graph routing problems have been widely studied in the fields of operations research, computer science and engineering. An important example of a routing problem is the traveling salesman problem. In this paper, we consider two variants of the general cluster routing problem. In these variants, we are given a complete undirected graph \\(G=(V,E)\\) with a metric cost function c and a partition \\(V=C_{1}\\cup C_{2}\\cdots \\cup C_{k}\\) of the vertex set. For a given subset \\(V^{'}\\) of V and subset \\(E^{'}\\) of E, the task is to find a walk T with minimum cost such that it visits each vertex in \\(V^{\\prime }\\) exactly once and covers each edge in \\(E^{\\prime }\\) at least once. Besides, for every \\(i\\in [k]\\), all the vertices in \\(T\\cap C_i\\) are required to be visited consecutively in T. We design two combinatorial approximation algorithms with ratios 21/11 and 2.75 for the two variants, respectively; both ratios match the approximation ratios for the corresponding variants of the cluster traveling salesman problem, a special case of general cluster routing problem.","authors":["Xiaoyan Zhang","Donglei Du","Gregory Gutin","Qiaoxia Ming"],"meta":["June 2021Journal of Combinatorial Optimization","DOI:10.1007/s10878-021-00772-8"],"references":["257376280_139-Approximation_for_Graphic_TSP","345446937_The_Salesman's_Improved_Paths_through_Forests","343913517_Approximation_Algorithms_for_General_Cluster_Routing_Problem","331619063_Approaching_32_for_the_s_-_t_-path_TSP","330099427_A_15-Approximation_for_Path_TSP","329397664_Beating_the_Integrality_Ratio_for_s-t-Tours_in_Graphs","287661759_An_effective_heuristic_algorithm_for_the_traveling_salesman_problem","284382099_P-complete_approximation_problem","284039089_Reducibility_among_combinatorial_problems","266284306_The_Traveling_Salesman_Problem_and_Its_Variations","257000373_On_some_connectivity_properties_of_Eulerian_graphs","254892020_Analysis_of_Christofides'_heuristic_Some_paths_are_more_difficult_than_cycles","243787873_Compexity_of_Computer_Computations","235067784_Worst-Case_Analysis_of_a_New_Heuristic_for_the_Traveling_Salesman_Problem","230859213_Eight-Fifth_Approximation_for_the_Path_TSP"]}
