{"id":"251474104_The_average-shadowing_property_and_strong_ergodicity","abstract":"Let X be a compact metric space and f:Xâ†’X be a continuous map. In this paper, we prove that if f has the average-shadowing property and the minimal points of f are dense in X, then f is weakly mixing and totally strongly ergodic. As applications we obtain that if f is a distal or Lyapunov stable map having the average-shadowing property, then X is consisting of one point. Moreover, we illustrate that the full shift has the average-shadowing property.","authors":["Yingxuan Niu"],"meta":["April 2011Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications 376(2):528-534","DOI:10.1016/j.jmaa.2010.11.024"],"references":["38371609_Diffeomorphisms_with_the_Average-Shadowing_Property_on_Two-Dimensional_Closed_Manifolds","285728122_Pseudo-orbit_tracing_property_and_completely_positive_entropy","279609472_Chapter_15_Topological_Dynamics","267009276_Topological_dynamics","266920073_Pseudo-orbit-tracing_and_completely_positive_entropy","266007246_Almost_equicontinuity_and_the_enveloping_semigroup","265822394_Pointwise_pseudo-orbit_tracing_property_and_chaos","265549604_Pseudo-orbit-tracing_and_chaos","265462357_Topological_theory_of_dynamical_sytems_Recent_advances","257194443_The_average-shadowing_property_and_topological_ergodicity","253822655_Small_perturbations_of_chaotic_dynamical_systems","248428483_When_is_a_Transitive_Map_Chaotic","225143056_On_the_pseudo_orbit_tracing_property_and_its_relationship_to_stability","223139367_Various_shadowing_properties_for_positively_expansive_maps","44725193_Equilibrium_States_and_the_Ergodic_Theory_of_Anosov_Diffeomorphism"]}
