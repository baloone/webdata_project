{"id":"316064732_Attribute_Profiles_from_Partitioning_Trees","abstract":"Morphological attribute profiles are among the most prominent spatial-spectral pixel description tools. They can be calculated efficiently from tree based representations of an image. Although widely and successfully used with various inclusion trees (i.e., component trees and tree of shape), in this paper, we investigate their implementation through partitioning trees, and specifically α and(\nω\n)-trees. Our prelim-\ninary findings show that they are capable of comparable results to the\nstate-of-the-art, while possessing additional properties rendering them\nsuitable for the analysis of multivariate images.","authors":["Petra Bosilj","Bharath Bhushan","Erchan Aptoula","Mauro Dalla Mura"],"meta":["May 2017","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-57240-6_31","Conference: ISMM: International Symposium on Mathematical Morphology and Its Applications to Signal and Image ProcessingAt: Fontainebleau, FranceVolume: Mathematical Morphology and Its Applications to Signal and Image Processing","Project: Morphological tools for image and region description - classification and retrieval"],"references":["320822345_Hyperspectral_image_classification_from_multiscale_description_with_constrained_connectivity_and_metric_learning","282692690_MToS_a_Tree_of_Shapes_for_Multivariate_Images","282499675_Hyperspectral_Image_Classification_With_Multidimensional_Attribute_Profiles","278798234_Hyperspectral_image_classification_from_multiscale_description_with_constrained_connectivity_and_metric_learning","271081421_A_Survey_on_SpectralSpatial_Classification_Techniques_Based_on_Attribute_Profiles","262025493_Automatic_Spectral-Spatial_Classification_Framework_Based_on_Attribute_Profiles_and_Supervised_Feature_Extraction","228569876_On_Morphological_Hierarchical_Representations_for_Image_Processing_and_Spatial_Data_Clustering","224144456_Morphological_Attribute_Profiles_for_the_Analysis_of_Very_High_Resolution_Images","50601408_Classification_of_Hyperspectral_Images_by_Using_Extended_Morphological_Attribute_Profiles_and_Independent_Component_Analysis","5576304_Antiextensive_connected_operators_for_image_and_sequence_processing","3327185_Binary_partition_tree_as_an_efficient_representation_for_image_processing_segmentation_and_information_retrieval","3203274_Classification_and_feature_extraction_for_remote_sensing_images_from_urban_areas_based_on_morphological_transformations","2519826_The_Tree_of_Shapes_of_an_Image","2443372_Anti-extensive_Connected_Operators_for_Image_and_Sequence_Processing","309693690_Deep_Learning_With_Attribute_Profiles_for_Hyperspectral_Image_Classification","295562388_Remote_Sensing_Image_Classification_Using_Attribute_Filters_Defined_Over_the_Tree_of_Shapes","290458532_Vector_Attribute_Profiles_for_Hyperspectral_Image_Classification","288906520_Random_forests","288245994_Histogram-Based_Attribute_Profiles_for_Classification_of_Very_High_Resolution_Remote_Sensing_Images","260992206_Ordering_Partial_Partitions_for_Image_Segmentation_and_Filtering_Merging_Creating_and_Inflating_Blocks","258789222_Automatic_Generation_of_Standard_Deviation_Attribute_Profiles_for_Spectral-Spatial_Classification_of_Remote_Sensing_Data","258304769_Machine_Learning_Volume_45_Number_1_-_SpringerLink","252122274_Extended_profiles_with_morphological_attribute_filters_for_the_analysis_of_hyperspectral_data","221991372_Scale-Space_from_a_Level_Lines_Tree","221293175_Monotonic_Tree","221249115_Preventing_Chaining_through_Transitions_While_Favouring_It_within_Homogeneous_Regions","221249111_Self-dual_Attribute_Profiles_for_the_Analysis_of_Remote_Sensing_Images","5305930_Constrained_Connectivity_for_Hierarchical_Image_Partitioning_and_Simplification","4283972_On_Genuine_Connectivity_Relations_Based_on_Logical_Predicates"]}
