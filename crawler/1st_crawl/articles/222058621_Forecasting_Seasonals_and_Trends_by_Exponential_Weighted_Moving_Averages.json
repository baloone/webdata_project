{"id":"222058621_Forecasting_Seasonals_and_Trends_by_Exponential_Weighted_Moving_Averages","abstract":"The paper provides a systematic development of the forecasting expressions for exponential weighted moving averages. Methods for series with no trend, or additive or multiplicative trend are examined. Similarly, the methods cover non-seasonal, and seasonal series with additive or multiplicative error structures. The paper is a reprinted version of the 1957 report to the Office of Naval Research (ONR 52) and is being published here to provide greater accessibility.
