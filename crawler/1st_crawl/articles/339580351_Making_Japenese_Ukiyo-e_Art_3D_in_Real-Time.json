{"id":"339580351_Making_Japenese_Ukiyo-e_Art_3D_in_Real-Time","abstract":"Ukiyo-e is a traditional Japanese painting style most commonly printed using wood blocks. Ukiyo-e prints feature distinct line work, bright colours, and a non-perspective projection. Most previous research on ukiyo-e styled computer graphics has been focused on creation of 2D images. In this paper we propose a framework for rendering interactive 3D scenes with ukiyo-e style. The rendering techniques use standard 3D models as input and require minimal additional information to automatically render scenes in a ukiyo-e style. The described techniques are evaluated based on their ability to emulate ukiyo-e prints, performance, and temporal coherence.","authors":["Innes Brown","Ognjen Arandjelovic"],"meta":["February 2020Sci 2(1):6","DOI:10.3390/sci2010006"],"references":["3045712_Continuous_Shading_of_Curved_Surfaces","280303223_Potential_Z-Fighting_Conflict_Detection_System_in_3D_Level_Design_Tools","242373779_Illumination_for_Computer_Generated_Pictures","234777477_OpenGL_Programming_Guide_The_Official_Guide_to_Learning_OpenGL_Version_12","224102754_Algorithm_for_Computer_Control_of_a_Digital_Plotter","2533648_Hardware_Shadow_Mapping"]}
