{"id":"329192820_AI4People-An_Ethical_Framework_for_a_Good_AI_Society_Opportunities_Risks_Principles_and_Recommendations","abstract":"This article reports the findings of AI4People, an Atomium—EISMD initiative designed to lay the foundations for a “Good AI Society”. We introduce the core opportunities and risks of AI for society; present a synthesis of five ethical principles that should undergird its development and adoption; and offer 20 concrete recommendations—to assess, to develop, to incentivise, and to support good AI—which in some cases may be undertaken directly by national or supranational policy makers, while in others may be led by other stakeholders. If adopted, these recommendations would serve as a firm foundation for the establishment of a Good AI Society.","authors":["Luciano Floridi","Josh Cowls","Monica Beltrametti","Raja Chatila"],"meta":["December 2018Minds and Machines 28(1)","DOI:10.1007/s11023-018-9482-5","Projects: Ethics of Artificial IntelligenceBusiness Ethics and Digitization"],"references":["331099286_Artificial_Intelligence_Crime_An_Interdisciplinary_Analysis_of_Foreseeable_Threats_and_Solutions","323248541_Soft_Ethics_and_the_Governance_of_the_Digital","320166470_The_Limits_of_Deterrence_Theory_in_Cyberspace","346642943_The_Ethics_of_Information","325750757_Artificial_Intelligence_Crime_An_Interdisciplinary_Analysis_of_Foreseeable_Threats_and_Solutions"]}
