{"id":"262974294_Depth_Map_Prediction_from_a_Single_Image_using_a_Multi-Scale_Deep_Network","abstract":"Predicting depth is an essential component in understanding the 3D geometry\nof a scene. While for stereo images local correspondence suffices for\nestimation, finding depth relations from a single image is less\nstraightforward, requiring integration of both global and local information\nfrom various cues. Moreover, the task is inherently ambiguous, with a large\nsource of uncertainty coming from the overall scale. In this paper, we present\na new method that addresses this task by employing two deep network stacks: one\nthat makes a coarse global prediction based on the entire image, and another\nthat refines this prediction locally. We also apply a scale-invariant error to\nhelp measure depth relations rather than scale. By leveraging the raw datasets\nas large sources of training data, our method achieves state-of-the-art results\non both NYU Depth and KITTI, and matches detailed depth boundaries without the\nneed for superpixelation.","authors":["David Eigen","Christian Puhrsch","Rob Fergus"],"meta":["June 2014","SourcearXiv"],"references":["258140919_Vision_meets_robotics_the_KITTI_dataset","222941742_Continuous_Markov_Random_Fields_for_Robust_Stereo_Estimation","221361415_ImageNet_a_Large-Scale_Hierarchical_Image_Database","41781190_Learning_Depth_From_Stereo","319770714_Photo_tourism_Exploring_photo_collections_in_3D","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","314100361_Indoor_Segmentation_and_Support_Inference_from_RGBD_Images","313086331_A_Taxonomy_And_Evaluation_Of_Dense_Two-Frame_Stereo_Correspondence_Algorithms","286734265_Pulling_Things_out_of_Perspective","267960550_ImageNet_Classification_with_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","262395079_Data-Driven_3D_Primitives_for_Single_Image_Understanding","262326782_DepthTransfer_Depth_Extraction_from_Video_Using_Non-Parametric_Sampling","262222168_Indoor_Segmentation_and_Support_Inference_from_RGBD_Images","260940211_Unsupervised_learning_of_depth_and_motion","225636510_A_Taxonomy_and_Evaluation_of_Dense_Two-Frame_Stereo_Correspondence_Algorithms","221619207_Learning_Depth_from_Single_Monocular_Images","221346133_High_speed_obstacle_avoidance_using_monocular_vision_and_reinforcement_learning","221305131_WT_SIFT_flow_dense_correspondence_across_different_scenes_In_ECCV","220648366_Learning_Long-Range_Vision_for_Autonomous_Off-Road_Driving","220184457_Automatic_photo_pop-up","220184195_Photo_tourism_exploring_photo_collections_in_3D_ACM_Trans_Graph_253835-846","220183446_Image_and_Depth_from_a_Conventional_Camera_with_a_Coded_Aperture","215458920_Multi-View_Geometry_in_Computer_Vision","24213726_Make3D_Learning_3D_Scene_Structure_from_a_Single_Still_Image"]}
