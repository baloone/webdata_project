{"id":"346539866_Deficits_in_motor_and_cognitive_functions_in_an_adult_mouse_model_of_hypoxia-ischemia_induced_stroke","abstract":"Ischemic strokes cause devastating brain damage and functional deficits with few treatments available. Previous studies have shown that the ischemia-hypoxia rapidly induces clinically similar thrombosis and neuronal loss, but any resulting behavioral changes are largely unknown. The goal of this study was to evaluate motor and cognitive deficits in adult HI mice. Following a previously established procedure, HI mouse models were induced by first ligating the right common carotid artery and followed by hypoxia. Histological data showed significant long-term neuronal losses and reactive glial cells in the ipsilateral striatum and hippocampus of the HI mice. Whereas the open field test and the rotarod test could not reliably distinguish between the sham and HI mice, in the tapered beam and wire-hanging tests, the HI mice showed short-term and long-term deficits, as evidenced by the increased number of foot faults and decreased hanging time respectively. In cognitive tests, the HI mice swam longer distances and needed more time to find the platform in the Morris water maze test and showed shorter freezing time in fear contextual tests after fear training. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that adult HI mice have motor and cognitive deficits and could be useful models for preclinical stroke research.","authors":["Li Feng","Chun-Xia Han","Shu-Yu Cao","He-Ming Zhang"],"meta":["November 2020Scientific Reports 10(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-020-77678-8"],"references":["339570937_Layer-specific_sensory_processing_impairment_in_the_primary_somatosensory_cortex_after_motor_cortex_infarction","337609925_547_transcriptomes_from_44_brain_areas_reveal_features_of_the_aging_brain_in_non-human_primates","333985436_Mortality_morbidity_and_risk_factors_in_China_and_its_provinces_1990-2017_a_systematic_analysis_for_the_Global_Burden_of_Disease_Study_2017","330613567_Abolition_of_aberrant_neurogenesis_ameliorates_cognitive_impairment_after_stroke_in_mice","327035333_Study_of_the_Obesity_and_the_Rate_of_Cholesterol_and_Triglycerides_Concentrations_among_Male_Prison_Inmates_in_Southern_Libya","325574279_Quantifying_Microglia_Morphology_from_Photomicrographs_of_Immunohistochemistry_Prepared_Tissue_Using_ImageJ","321428945_Photothrombotic_Stroke_as_a_Model_of_Ischemic_Stroke","319289202_Beneficial_Effects_of_Delayed_P7C3-A20_Treatment_After_Transient_MCAO_in_Rats","318473991_Precision_Stroke_Animal_Models_the_Permanent_MCAO_Model_Should_Be_the_Primary_Model_Not_Transient_MCAO","321617117_Rodent_Models_of_Stroke"]}
