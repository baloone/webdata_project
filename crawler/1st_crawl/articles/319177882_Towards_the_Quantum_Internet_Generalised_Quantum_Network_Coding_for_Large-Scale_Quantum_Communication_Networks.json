{"id":"319177882_Towards_the_Quantum_Internet_Generalised_Quantum_Network_Coding_for_Large-Scale_Quantum_Communication_Networks","abstract":"Large-scale Quantum Network Coding (LQNC) is conceived for distributing entangled qubits over large-scale quantum communication networks supporting both teleportation and Quantum Key Distribution (QKD). More specifically, the LQNC is characterised by detailing the encoding and decoding process for distributing entangled pairs of qubits to M pairs of source-and-target users connected via a backbone route of N hops. The LQNC-based system advocated is then compared to Entanglement Swapping (ES) based systems for highlighting the benefits of the proposed LQNC.","authors":["Hung Viet Nguyen","Zunaira Babar","Dimitrios Alanis","Panagiotis Botsinis"],"meta":["July 2017IEEE Access PP(99)","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2738781","Projects: Quantum Communications and Quantum Signal ProcessingQuantum Communications"],"references":["305416975_EXIT-Chart_Aided_Quantum_Code_Design_Improves_the_Normalised_Throughput_of_Realistic_Quantum_Devices","301817684_Secret_Sharing_of_a_Quantum_State","287686799_Entanglement_Swapping_of_Two_Arbitrarily_Degraded_Entangled_States","339504416_Network_Coding_Fundamentals","306421719_Entanglement_swapping_and_teleportation_based_on_cavity_QED_method_using_the_nonlinear_atom-field_interaction_Cavities_with_a_hybrid_of_coherent_and_number_states","301837669_Remote_preparation_of_three-photon_entangled_states_via_single-photon_measurement","294105852_Security_of_Quantum_Key_Distribution","288842662_Two_steps_closer_to_a_quantum_internet_News","283115380_Quantum_Cryptography_and_Its_Applications_over_the_Internet","282584166_Modeling_daytime_sky_access_for_a_satellite_quantum_key_distribution_downlink"]}
