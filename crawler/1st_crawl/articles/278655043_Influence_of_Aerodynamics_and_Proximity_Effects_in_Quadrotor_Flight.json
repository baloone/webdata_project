{"id":"278655043_Influence_of_Aerodynamics_and_Proximity_Effects_in_Quadrotor_Flight","abstract":"The dynamic response and performance of a micro UAV is greatly influenced by its aerodynamics which in turn is affected by the interactions with features in the environment in close proximity. In the paper we address the modeling of quadrotor robots in different flight conditions that include relative wind velocity and proximity to the ground, the ceiling and other robots. We discuss the incorporation of these models into controllers and the use of a swarm of robots to map features in the environment from variations in the aerodynamics.","authors":["Caitlin Powers","Daniel Mellinger","Aleksandr Kushleyev","Bruce Kothmann"],"meta":["January 2013","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-00065-7_21","In book: Experimental Robotics (pp.289-302)"],"references":["304417745_Towards_A_Swarm_of_Agile_Micro_Quadrotors","245430266_Challenges_Facing_Future_Micro-Air-Vehicle_Development","224557340_Aerodynamics_and_control_of_autonomous_quadrotor_helicopters_in_aggressive_maneuvering","37439805_Design_and_Control_of_quadrotors_with_application_to_autonomous_flying","8629037_Wing_inertia_and_whole-body_acceleration_an_analysis_of_instantaneous_aerodynamic_force_production_in_cockatiels_Nymphicus_hollandicus_flying_across_a_range_of_speeds","8042596_Effective_leadership_and_decision-making_in_animal_groups_on_the_move","278001927_Precision_and_Dynamics_of_Positioning_by_Canada_Geese_Flying_in_Formation","257523156_Towards_a_swarm_of_agile_micro_quadrotors","224252786_Minimum_snap_trajectory_generation_and_control_for_quadrotors","224173788_The_GRASP_multiple_micro-uav_testbed","50916259_Flock_flying_improves_pigeons'_homing_GPS-track_analysis_of_individual_flyers_versus_small_groups"]}
