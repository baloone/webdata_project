{"id":"264862731_Sparse_solution_of_the_Lyapunov_equation_for_large-scale_interconnected_systems","abstract":"In this paper we consider the problem of computing a sparse approximate\nsolution of the continuous-time Lyapunov equation for large-scale\ninterconnected (distributed) systems. Specifically, we show that if the\ncoefficient matrices of the Lyapunov equation are symmetric, sparse banded\nmatrices then the solution exhibits off-diagonally decaying behavior. On the\nbasis of this important insight, we develop a computationally efficient method\nfor approximating the solution of the Lyapunov equation by a sparse banded\nmatrix. The computational and memory complexities of the developed method are\nlinear in the size of coefficient matrices. Consequently, the developed method\nis computationally feasible for interconnected systems with a very large number\nof subsystems. The results of this paper can be generalized for the sparse\ncoefficient matrices whose first few powers are sparse matrices. Furthermore,\nthe results of this paper can be used to compute a sparse approximate solution\nof the Sylvester equation in which coefficient matrices are sparse. This novel\napproximation method opens the door to the development of computationally\nefficient methods for approximating the solution of the large-scale Riccati\nequation by a sparse matrix.","authors":["Aleksandar Haber","Michel Verhaegen"],"meta":["August 2014Automatica
