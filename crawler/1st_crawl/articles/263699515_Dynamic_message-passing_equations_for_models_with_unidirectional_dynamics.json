{"id":"263699515_Dynamic_message-passing_equations_for_models_with_unidirectional_dynamics","abstract":"Understanding and quantifying the dynamics of disordered out-of-equilibrium\nmodels is an important problem in many branches of science. Using dynamic\ncavity method on time trajectories, we construct a general procedure for\nderiving the dynamic message-passing (DMP) equations for a large class of\nmodels with unidirectional dynamics - the key ingredient that makes the problem\nsolvable. These equations are applicable to single instances of the\ncorresponding problems with arbitrary initial conditions, and are\nasymptotically exact for problems defined on locally tree-like graphs. When\napplied to real-world networks, they generically provide a good analytic\napproximation of the real dynamics.","authors":["Andrey Y.
