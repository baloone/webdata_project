{"id":"320726784_SGDLibrary_A_MATLAB_library_for_stochastic_optimization_algorithms","abstract":"We consider the problem of finding the minimizer of a function f: R^d -> R of the finite-sum form min f(w) = 1/n sum_i f_i(w). This problem has been studied intensively in recent years in the field of machine learning. One typical but promising approach for large-scale data is to use a stochastic optimization algorithm to solve the problem. SGDLibrary is a readable, flexible and extensible pure-MATLAB library of a collection of stochastic optimization algorithms. The purpose of the library is to provide researchers and implementers a comprehensive evaluation environment for the use of these algorithms on various machine learning problems.","authors":["Hiroyuki Kasai"],"meta":["April 2018Journal of Machine Learning Research 19"],"references":["322152535_Automated_Inference_with_Adaptive_Batches","314116011_SARAH_A_Novel_Method_for_Machine_Learning_Problems_Using_Stochastic_Recursive_Gradient","303221916_Barzilai-Borwein_Step_Size_for_Stochastic_Gradient_Descent","280912215_A_Linearly-Convergent_Stochastic_L-BFGS_Algorithm","265469570_Global_Convergence_of_Online_Limited_Memory_BFGS","263582586_SAGA_A_Fast_Incremental_Gradient_Method_With_Support_for_Non-Strongly_Convex_Composite_Objectives","313501588_Accelerating_stochastic_gradient_descent_using_predictive_variance_reduction","304858104_Stochastic_Quasi-Newton_Methods_for_Nonconvex_Stochastic_Optimization","286271944_On_the_importance_of_initialization_and_momentum_in_deep_learning","269935079_Adam_A_Method_for_Stochastic_Optimization"]}
