{"id":"2413225_Building_Secure_Data_Warehouse_Schemas_from_Federated_Information_Systems","abstract":"There are similarities between architectures for Federated Information Systems and architectures for Data Warehousing. In the context of an integrated architecture for both Federated Information Systems and Data Warehousing, we discuss how additional schema levels provide security, and operations to convert from one level to the next.","authors":["Flix Saltor","Marta Oliva","Alberto Abelló","José Samos"],"meta":["October 2001","DOI:10.1007/978-94-017-1769-4_8"],"references":["318018036_Federated_database_systems_for_managing_distributed_heterogeneous_and_autonomous_databases","270276876_Building_the_Data_Warehouse","265829128_Data_management_systems_Evolution_and_interoperation","255664352_Object-Oriented_Multidatabase_Systems_A_Solution_for_Advanced_Applications","247484425_Semantic_Heterogeneity_in_Multidatabase_Systems","238711760_The_data_warehousing_toolkit","238701948_The_Data_Warehouse_Lifecycle_Toolkit","221557521_Benefits_of_an_Object-Oriented_Multidimensional_Data_Model","221557499_A_Canonical_Model_for_the_Interoperability_Among_Object-Oriented_and_Relational_Databases","221549425_A_Semantic-Discriminated_Approach_to_Integration_of_Federated_Databases"]}
