{"id":"334353065_Recipe1M_A_Dataset_for_Learning_Cross-Modal_Embeddings_for_Cooking_Recipes_and_Food_Images","abstract":"In this paper, we introduce Recipe1M+, a new large-scale, structured corpus of over one million cooking recipes and 13 million food images. As the largest publicly available collection of recipe data, Recipe1M+ affords the ability to train high-capacity models on aligned, multi-modal data. Using these data, we train a neural network to learn a joint embedding of recipes and images that yields impressive results on an image-recipe retrieval task. Moreover, we demonstrate that regularization via the addition of a high-level classification objective both improves retrieval performance to rival that of humans and enables semantic vector arithmetic. We postulate that these embeddings will provide a basis for further exploration of the Recipe1M+ dataset and food and cooking in general. Code, data and models are publicly available.","authors":["Javier Mar√≠n","Aritro Biswas","Ferda Ofli","Nicholas Hynes"],"meta":["July 2019IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TPAMI.2019.2927476","Project: Understanding Food Images and Recipes"],"references":["326140829_Cross-Modal_Retrieval_in_the_Cooking_Context_Learning_Semantic_Text-Image_Embeddings","322652571_Food_recognition_and_recipe_analysis_integrating_visual_content_context_and_external_knowledge","320964718_Learning_Cross-Modal_Embeddings_for_Cooking_Recipes_and_Food_Images","315874063_Is_Saki_delicious_The_Food_Perception_Gap_on_Instagram_and_Its_Relation_to_Health","307747289_Show_and_tell_A_neural_image_caption_generator","301931238_Social_Media_Image_Analysis_for_Public_Health","301843342_Fetishizing_Food_in_Digital_Age_foodporn_Around_the_World","279839496_Learning_Deep_Features_for_Scene_Recognition_using_Places_Database","279163099_Geolocalized_Modeling_for_Dish_Recognition","279068396_Skip-Thought_Vectors","271659249_FoodCam_A_real-time_food_recognition_system_on_a_smartphone","265295439_ImageNet_Large_Scale_Visual_Recognition_Challenge","234131319_Efficient_Estimation_of_Word_Representations_in_Vector_Space","228339739_Viualizing_data_using_t-SNE","329750604_Finding_Beans_in_Burgers_Deep_Semantic-Visual_Embedding_with_Localization","328374997_Deep_Understanding_of_Cooking_Procedure_for_Cross-modal_Recipe_Retrieval","324664435_RecipeScape_An_Interactive_Tool_for_Analyzing_Cooking_Instructions_at_Scale","320542952_A_Delicious_Recipe_Analysis_Framework_for_Exploring_Multi-Modal_Recipes_with_Various_Attributes","320540992_Cross-modal_Recipe_Retrieval_with_Rich_Food_Attributes","319770357_DeCAF_A_Deep_Convolutional_Activation_Feature_for_Generic_Visual_Recognition","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","319770144_Unsupervised_Representation_Learning_with_Deep_Convolutional_Generative_Adversarial_Networks","318200394_Places_A_10_Million_Image_Database_for_Scene_Recognition","311610688_Learning_Aligned_Cross-Modal_Representations_from_Weakly_Aligned_Data","310820080_Deep-based_Ingredient_Recognition_for_Cooking_Recipe_Retrieval","309551504_Cross-Modal_Scene_Networks","308813785_Deep_visual-semantic_alignments_for_generating_image_descriptions","304408723_Im2Calories_Towards_an_Automated_Mobile_Vision_Food_Diary","303412940_DeepFood_Deep_Learning-Based_Food_Image_Recognition_for_Computer-Aided_Dietary_Assessment","302401810_Understanding_and_Predicting_Online_Food_Recipe_Production_Patterns","300358519_Food-101_-_Mining_Discriminative_Components_with_Random_Forests","286512696_Deep_Residual_Learning_for_Image_Recognition","265554383_Sequence_to_Sequence_Learning_with_Neural_Networks","265385906_Very_Deep_Convolutional_Networks_for_Large-Scale_Image_Recognition","262416109_Distributed_Representations_of_Sentences_and_Documents"]}
