{"id":"265966036_Development_of_the_CAD_system_for_designing_non-standard_constructions_from_elastomers","abstract":"The development of the Computer-Aided Design (CAD) system FORTU-FEM, which is based on the Finite-Element Method (FEM), is considered in the paper. Unlike other CAD systems, which does not allow to its users to change the schema of calculation, FORTU-FEM has the open architecture and allows to engineers to develop the various methods for analysis of non-standard constructions. The example of application of FORTU-FEM for calculation of the tensional and the deformed states of constructions from elastomers is given.","authors":["Vladimir Lavrik","J.
