{"id":"319770430_Rich_feature_hierarchies_for_accurate_object_detection_and_semantic_segmentation","abstract":"Can a large convolutional neural network trained for whole-image classification on ImageNet be coaxed into detecting objects in PASCAL? We show that the answer is yes, and that the resulting system is simple, scalable, and boosts mean average precision, relative to the venerable deformable part model, by more than 40% (achieving a final mAP of 48% on VOC 2007). Our framework combines powerful computer vision techniques for generating bottom-up region proposals with recent advances in learning high-capacity convolutional neural networks. We call the resulting system R-CNN: Regions with CNN features. The same framework is also competitive with state-of-the-art semantic segmentation methods, demonstrating its flexibility. Beyond these results, we execute a battery of experiments that provide insight into what the network learns to represent, revealing a rich hierarchy of discriminative and often semantically meaningful features.","authors":["Ross Girshick","Jeff Donahue","Trevor Darrell","Jitendra Malik"],"meta":["November 2014","Conference: CVPR"],"references":[]}
