{"id":"220915910_The_Omega_Number_Irreducible_Complexity_in_Pure_Math","abstract":"We discuss the halting probability 立, whose bits are irreducible mathematical facts, that is, facts which cannot be derived from any principles simpler than they are. In other words, you need a mathematical theory with N bits of axioms in order to be able to determine N bits of 立. This pathological property of 立 is difficult to reconcile with traditional philosophies of mathematics and with traditional views of the nature of mathematical proof and of mathematical knowledge. Instead 立 suggests a quasi-empirical view of math that emphasizes the similarities between mathematics and physics rather than the differences.","authors":["Gregory J.
