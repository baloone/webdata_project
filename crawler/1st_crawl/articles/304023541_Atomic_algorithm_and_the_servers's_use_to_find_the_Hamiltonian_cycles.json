{"id":"304023541_Atomic_algorithm_and_the_servers's_use_to_find_the_Hamiltonian_cycles","abstract":"Inspired by the movement of the particles in the atom, I demonstrated in [5] the exsitence of a ploynomial algorithm of the order O(n 3) for finding Hamiltonian cycles in a graph. In this article I will give an improvement in space and in time of the algorithm says : we know that there exist several methods to find the Hamiltonian cycles such as the Monte Carlo method, Dynamic programming, or DNA computing. Unfortunately they are either expensive or slow to execute it. Hence the idea to use multiple servers to solve this problem.","authors":["Mohamed Sghiar"],"meta":["July 2016International Journal of Engineering Research and Applications 6(6)"],"references":["294873879_Algorithmes_quantiques_cycles_hamiltoniens_et_la_k-coloration_des_graphes","273798010_Graph_Theory","228057841_Combinatorial_Problems_Exercises","228057735_Computers_And_Intractability_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness","220695890_Computers_and_Intracdtability_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness","44260596_A_Polynomial_Time_Algorithm_for_Hamilton_Cycle_Path"]}
