{"id":"277252012_Retinal_Vascular_Changes_are_a_Marker_for_Cerebral_Vascular_Diseases","abstract":"The retinal circulation is a potential marker of cerebral vascular disease because it shares origin and drainage with the intracranial circulation and because it can be directly visualized using ophthalmoscopy. Cross-sectional and cohort studies have demonstrated associations between chronic retinal and cerebral vascular disease, acute retinal and cerebral vascular disease, and chronic retinal vascular disease and acute cerebral vascular disease. In particular, certain qualitative features of retinopathy, retinal artery occlusion, and increased retinal vein caliber are associated with concurrent and future cerebrovascular events. These associations persist after accounting for confounding variables known to be disease-causing in both circulations, which supports the potential use of retinal vasculature findings to stratify individuals with regards to cerebral vascular disease risk.","authors":["Heather Elspeth Moss"],"meta":["July 2015Current Neurology and Neuroscience Reports 15(7):561","DOI:10.1007/s11910-015-0561-1","SourcePubMed"],"references":["256706685_Retinal_vessel_tortuosity_measures_and_their_applications","301942698_Heart_Rate_Variability_and_Incident_Stroke_The_Atherosclerosis_Risk_in_Communities_Study","274019981_Retinal_Emboli_and_Stroke","262768891_Acute_Retinal_Arterial_Ischemia_An_Emergency_Often_Ignored","261742221_Localized_Retinal_Nerve_Fiber_Layer_Defects_and_Stroke","260253387_Retinal_Microvascular_Abnormalities_Predict_Progression_of_Brain_Microvascular_Disease_An_Atherosclerosis_Risk_in_Communities_Magnetic_Resonance_Imaging_Study","260119843_Co-occurrence_of_Acute_Retinal_Artery_Occlusion_and_Acute_Ischemic_Stroke_Diffusion-Weighted_Magnetic_Resonance_Imaging_Study_Reply","255790838_Hypertensive_Retinopathy_and_Risk_of_Stroke","250919007_Retinal_Microvascular_Changes_and_Risk_of_Stroke_The_Singapore_Malay_Eye_Study","236958141_Microvascular_Structure_and_Network_in_the_Retina_of_Patients_With_Ischemic_Stroke"]}
