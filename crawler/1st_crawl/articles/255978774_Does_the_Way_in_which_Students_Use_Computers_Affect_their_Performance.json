{"id":"255978774_Does_the_Way_in_which_Students_Use_Computers_Affect_their_Performance","abstract":"In this paper we investigate how differences in the frequency and type of\ncomputer usage, both at home and at school, of 15-year-old Italian students might\naffect their school performance. Using the PISA 2006 dataset and controlling for a\nwide range of individual and school characteristics, our results suggest that students\nwho frequently use a computer at home tend to obtain higher test scores than those\nwho never use one. More importantly, we find a significant positive correlation\nbetween student achievement and the use of a computer at home as an\neducational/learning device. Focusing on the frequency of computer usage at school,\nit emerges that student achievement improves with the intensity of computer use but\nthat the effect becomes smaller the more often they use the computer and even\nnegative when students use the computer almost every day at school.","authors":["Michela Ponzo"],"meta":["January 2011","SourceOAI"],"references":["254433650_Da_dove_vengono_le_competenze_scolastiche","226312348_Can_computer_use_hurt_science_achievement_The_USA_results_from_PISA","308469036_The_effects_of_violent_video_game_habits_on_adolescent_hostility_aggressive_behaviors_and_school_performance","284508979_The_computer_delusion","284295690_Computers_make_kids_smarter_-_Right","249765398_Computers_and_Career_Choices_Gender_Differences_in_Grades_7_and_10_Students","223588640_Is_students'_computer_use_at_home_related_to_their_mathematical_performance_at_school","222688297_Putting_Computerized_Instruction_to_the_Test_A_Randomized_Evaluation_of_a_Scientifically-Based_Reading_Program","222415156_Are_Computer_Skills_the_New_Basic_Skills_The_Returns_to_Computer_Writing_and_Math_Skills_in_Britain","220175128_Home_Computers_and_School_Performance"]}
