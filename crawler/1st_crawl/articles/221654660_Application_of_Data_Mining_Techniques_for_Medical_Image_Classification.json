{"id":"221654660_Application_of_Data_Mining_Techniques_for_Medical_Image_Classification","abstract":"Breast cancer represents the second leading cause of cancer deaths in women today and it is the most common type of cancer in women. This paper presents some experiments for tumour detection in digital mammography. We inves- tigate the use of different data mining techniques, neural networks and association rule mining, for anomaly detec- tion and classification. The results show that the two ap- proaches performed well, obtaining a classification accu- racy reaching over 70% percent for both techniques. More- over, the experiments we conducted demonstrate the use and effectiveness of association rule mining in image cate- gorization.","authors":["Luiza Antonie","Osmar R.
