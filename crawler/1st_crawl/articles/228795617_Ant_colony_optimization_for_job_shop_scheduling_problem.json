{"id":"228795617_Ant_colony_optimization_for_job_shop_scheduling_problem","abstract":"This paper presents an application of the Ant colony optimization metaheuristic to the job shop scheduling problem. A pheromone alteration strategy which improves the basic ant system by utilizing the behaviour of artificial ants to perform local search is introduced. Experiments using well-known benchmark JSSP problems show that this approach improves on the performance obtained by the basic ant system and is competitive with another recently proposed extension of the ant system, the MAX-MIN algorithm.","authors":["Mario Ventresca","Beatrice M Ombuki"],"meta":["March 2004"],"references":["301232811_Self-Organized_Shortcuts_in_the_Argentine_Ant","277474071_Tabu_search-part_II","260449008_A_new_rank_based_version_of_the_ant_system_A_computational_study","228540568_Ant_system_for_job-shop_scheduling","220121372_An_Ant_Colony_Optimization_Algorithm_for_Shop_Scheduling_Problems","3949441_Ant_Colony_Optimization_for_FOP_Shop_Scheduling_A_case_study_on_different_pheromone_representations","2831286_The_Ant_Colony_Optimization_Meta-Heuristic","2370879_Ant_Colony_Optimization_for_Resource-Constrained_Project_Scheduling","284400209_MAX-MIN_Ant_System","245290374_An_ant_colony_optimization_algorithm_to_tackle_shop_scheduling_problems","220695890_Computers_and_Intracdtability_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness","220205065_Ant_Colony_Optimization_with_Global_Pheromone_Evaluation_for_Scheduling_a_Single_Machine","201977138_Ant_Colony_System_A_Cooperative_Learning_Approach_to_the_Traveling_Salesman_Problem","2683115_Ant_Colony_Optimisation_for_Job_Shop_Scheduling","2369336_MACS-VRPTW_A_multiple_ant_colony_system_for_vehicle_routing_problems_with_time_windows"]}
