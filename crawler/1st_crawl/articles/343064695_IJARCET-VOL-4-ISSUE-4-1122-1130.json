It is used for reputation evaluation based on customer reviews of any kind of product and applications. Opinion mining also known as sentiment analysis is one of the most important part of this research area. Big Data is a new term used to identify the datasets that due to their large size, we cannot manage them with the typical data mining software tools. This data is in the order of magnitude of petabytes. It can be found easily on web, Social media, remote sensing data and medical records in the form of customer reviews etc., it may be structured, semi-structured or unstructured data and we can use this big data for opinion mining. This paper describes the methods used for reputation evaluation on big unstructured data, it also focuses on combination of different classifiers techniques to overcome the challenges and incrementally enhance the granularity of opinion capturing.","authors":["Uma Gurav"],"meta":["July 2020INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED RESEARCH IN ENGINEERING & TECHNOLOGY 4(4):1122-1130","Project: sentiment analysis"],"references":["229039304_An_Active_DBMS_Style_Activity_Service_for_Cloud_Environments","228523621_Extracting_opinions_and_facts_for_business_intelligence","339502749_Opinion_Mining_and_Sentiment_Analysis","316600283_Data_Mining_Concepts_and_Techniques","307936026_Large-scale_sentiment_analysis_for_news_and_blogs","306522631_OPINION_MINING_AND_SENTIMENT_CLASSIFICATION_A_SURVEY","302875900_Identifying_expressions_of_opinion_in_context","280113623_The_Text_Mining_Handbook_Advanced_Approaches_in_Analyzing_Unstructured_Data","260333216_Using_Objective_Words_in_SentiWordNet_to_Improve_Word-of-Mouth_Sentiment_Classification","254047799_Sentiment_classification_using_sentence-level_semantic_orientation_of_opinion_terms_from_blogs","224221417_Interaction_Mediation_and_Ties_An_Analytic_Hierarchy_for_Socio-Technical_Systems","221520217_A_holistic_lexicon-based_approach_to_opinion_mining","228523135_Twitter_sentiment_classification_using_distant_supervision","225129893_A_Rule-Based_Language_for_Complex_Event_Processing_and_Reasoning","221400052_Policy-Based_Event-Driven_Services-Oriented_Architecture_for_Cloud_Services_Operation_Management"]}
