{"id":"326194617_Edge-CoCaCo_Toward_Joint_Optimization_of_Computation_Caching_and_Communication_on_Edge_Cloud","abstract":"With the development of recent innovative applications (e.g., augmented reality, natural language processing, and various cognitive applications), more and more computation-intensive and rich-media tasks are delay-sensitive. Edge cloud computing is expected to be an effective solution to meet the demand for low latency. By the use of content offloading and/or computation offloading, users' quality of experience is improved with shorter delay. Compared to existing edge computing solutions, this article introduces a new concept of computing task caching and gives the optimal computing task caching policy. Furthermore, joint optimization of computation, caching, and communication on the edge cloud, dubbed Edge-CoCaCo, is proposed. Then we give the solution to that optimization problem. Finally, the simulation experimental results show that compared to the other schemes, Edge-CoCaCo has shorter delay.","authors":["Min Chen","Yixue Hao","Long Hu","M.
