{"id":"280243286_Reversible_Watson-Crick_Automata","abstract":"Watson-Crick automata are finite automata working on double strands.\nExtensive research work has already been done on non-deterministic Watson-Crick\nautomata and on deterministic Watson-Crick automata. In this paper, we\nintroduce a new model of Watson-Crick automata which is reversible in nature\nnamed reversible Watson-Crick automata and explore its computational power. We\nshow even though the model is reversible and one way it accepts all regular\nlanguages and also analyze the state complexity of the above stated model with\nrespect to non-deterministic block automata and non-deterministic finite\nautomata and establish its superiority. We further explore the relation of the\nreversible model with twin-shuffle language and recursively enumerable\nlanguages.","authors":["Kingshuk Chatterjee","Kumar Sankar Ray"],"meta":["August 2017Acta Informatica 54(5)","DOI:10.1007/s00236-016-0267-0","SourcearXiv"],"references":["267267322_Equivalence_of_Subclasses_of_Two-Way_Non-Deterministic_Watson_Crick_Automata","228945005_Exploring_regular_reversibility_in_Watson-Crick_finite_automata","312628416_Logical_reversibility_of_computation","310781733_One-way_reversible_multi-head_finite_automata","291177525_One-Way_Reversible_Multi-head_Finite_Automata","276345069_State_complexity_of_deterministic_Watson-Crick_automata_and_time_varying_Watson-Crick_automata","224104463_Logical_Reversibility_of_Computation","222624880_The_state_complexities_of_some_basic_operations_on_regular_languages","222521501_On_the_descriptional_complexity_of_Watson-Crick_automata","222330637_Tree_pushdown_automata"]}
