{"id":"303337092_Absorbing_boundary_conditions_for_the_numerical_simulation_of_waves","abstract":"In practical calculations, it is often essential to introduce artificial boundaries to limit the area of computation. Here we develop a systematic method for obtaining a hierarchy of local boundary conditions at these artificial boundaries. These boundary conditions not only guarantee stable difference approximations but also minimize the (unphysical) artificial reflections which occur at the boundaries.","authors":["B. Engquist","A.
