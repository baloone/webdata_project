Then at least one of the two graphsG12,G13 is connected and bridgeless. — A classical result ofFrink follows from this theorem which is the key to a simple proof of Petersen's theorem. Moreover, the above result can be used to prove practically all classical results on Eulerian graphs, including best upper and lower bounds for the number of Eulerian trails in a connected Eulerian graph. In the theory of Eulerian graphs, it can be viewed as the basis for good algorithms checking on several properties of this class of graphs.","authors":["Herbert Fleischner"],"meta":["December 1976Monatshefte für Mathematik 81(4):267-278","DOI:10.1007/BF01387754"],"references":["226341880_Matching_Euler_Tours_and_the_Chinese_Postman","336906859_Connectivity_in_Graphs","268651432_Farbungsproblem_auf_Flachen_und_Graphen","265427606_Connectivity_in_Graphs","242968845_The_importance_of_being_Euler","230596014_Theorie_der_Endlichen_und_Unendlichen_Graphen","37044692_Einfuhrung_in_die_Theorie_der_endlichen_Graphen_II"]}
