{"id":"264899823_Robust_width_A_characterization_of_uniformly_stable_and_robust_compressed_sensing","abstract":"Compressed sensing seeks to invert an underdetermined linear system by\nexploiting additional knowledge of the true solution. Over the last decade,\nseveral instances of compressed sensing have been studied for various\napplications, and for each instance, reconstruction guarantees are available\nprovided the sensing operator satisfies certain sufficient conditions. In this\npaper, we completely characterize the sensing operators which allow uniformly\nstable and robust reconstruction by convex optimization for many of these\ninstances. The characterized sensing operators satisfy a new property we call\nthe robust width property, which simultaneously captures notions of widths from\napproximation theory and of restricted eigenvalues from statistical regression.\nWe provide a geometric interpretation of this property, we discuss its\nrelationship with the restricted isometry property, and we apply techniques\nfrom geometric functional analysis to find random matrices which satisfy the\nproperty with high probability.","authors":["Jameson Cahill","Dustin G.
