{"id":"349205834_Quantum_capacity_analysis_of_multi-level_amplitude_damping_channels","abstract":"Evaluating capacities of quantum channels is the first purpose of quantum Shannon theory, but in most cases the task proves to be very hard. Here, we introduce the set of Multi-level Amplitude Damping quantum channels as a generalization of the standard qubit Amplitude Damping Channel to quantum systems of finite dimension d . In the special case of d = 3, by exploiting degradability, data-processing inequalities, and channel isomorphism, we compute the associated quantum and private classical capacities for a rather wide class of maps, extending the set of models whose capacity can be computed known so far. We proceed then to the evaluation of the entanglement assisted quantum and classical capacities.","authors":["Stefano Chessa","Vittorio Giovannetti"],"meta":["February 2021Communications Physics 4(1)","DOI:10.1038/s42005-021-00524-4"],"references":["353279236_Partially_Coherent_Direct_Sum_Channels","336580978_High-Dimensional_Quantum_Communication_Benefits_Progress_and_Future_Challenges","335880725_Ultracold_polar_molecules_as_qudits","335844957_Realization_of_efficient_quantum_gates_with_a_superconducting_qubit-qutrit_circuit","342728815_Information-theoretic_aspects_of_the_generalized_amplitude-damping_channel","339062022_Scalable_quantum_computing_with_qudits_on_a_graph","335457651_Efficient_Accessible_Bounds_to_the_Classical_Capacity_of_Quantum_Channels","335200697_Quantum_Teleportation_in_High_Dimensions","334597099_Quantum_Systems_Channels_Information_A_Mathematical_Introduction","330494624_Experimental_Engineering_of_Arbitrary_Qudit_States_with_Discrete-Time_Quantum_Walks"]}
