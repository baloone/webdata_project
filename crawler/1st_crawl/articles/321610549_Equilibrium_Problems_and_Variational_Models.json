{"id":"321610549_Equilibrium_Problems_and_Variational_Models","abstract":"The volume, devoted to variational analysis and its applications, collects selected and refereed contributions, which provide an outline of the field. The meeting of the title \"Equilibrium Problems and Variational Models\", which was held in Erice (Sicily) in the period June 23 - July 2 2000, was the occasion of the presentation of some of these papers; other results are a consequence of a fruitful and constructive atmosphere created during the meeting. New results, which enlarge the field of application of variational analysis, are presented in the book; they deal with the vectorial analysis, time dependent variational analysis, exact penalization, high order deriva足 tives, geometric aspects, distance functions and log-quadratic proximal methodology. The new theoretical results allow one to improve in a remarkable way the study of significant problems arising from the applied sciences, as continuum model of transportation, unilateral problems, multicriteria spatial price models, network equilibrium problems and many others. As noted in the previous book \"Equilibrium Problems: Nonsmooth Optimization and Variational Inequality Models\", edited by F. Giannessi, A. Maugeri and P.M. Pardalos, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Vol. 58 (2001), the progress obtained by variational analysis has permitted to han足 dle problems whose equilibrium conditions are not obtained by the mini足 mization of a functional. These problems obey a more realistic equilibrium condition expressed by a generalized orthogonality (complementarity) con足 dition, which enriches our knowledge of the equilibrium behaviour. Also this volume presents important examples of this formulation.","authors":["Patrizia Daniele","Franco Giannessi","Antonino Maugeri"],"meta":["January 2003","DOI:10.1007/978-1-4613-0239-1","ISBN: 978-1-4613-7955-3"],"references":[]}
