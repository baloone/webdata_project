{"id":"299608413_Synthetic_Aperture_Radar_Imaging_Using_Nonlinear_Frequency_Modulation_Signal","abstract":"In this paper, a new nonlinear frequency modulation (NLFM) waveform is developed that can be used as a transmitted chirp in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging to improve the imaging quality compared to a linear frequency modulation (LFM) chirp signal. The new NLFM is constructed based on piecewise linear functions, which are optimized using multi-objective optimization. Different signal processing algorithms are investigated in order to use NLFM as the transmitted chirp in a SAR system. In addition, a modified motion compensation (MC) algorithm using navigation data is proposed for the range-Doppler algorithm. Strip-map SAR geometry is considered to generate a SAR raw signal, in order to validate the new offered chirp signal and the proposed MC algorithm.","authors":["Jamal Saeedi","Karim Faez"],"meta":["April 2016IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems 52(1):99-110","DOI:10.1109/TAES.2015.140310"],"references":["269366877_ENHANCEMENTS_TO_SYNTHETIC_APERTURE_RADAR_CHIRP_WAVEFORMS_AND_NON-COHERENT_SAR_CHANGE_DETECTION_FOLLOWING_LARGE_SCALE_DISASTERS","267239757_SAR_Processing_with_Non-Linear_FM_Chirp_Waveforms","255280211_Generating_nonlinear_FM_chirp_waveforms_for_radar","4064229_Interpretations_of_the_Omega-k_algorithm_and_comparisons_with_other_algorithm","282901719_The_design_of_a_non_linear_pulse_compression_system_to_give_a_low_loss_high_resolution_radar_performance","271510443_Radar_Signals","264928150_Spotlight_Synthetic_Aperture_Radar_Signal_Processing_Algorithms","262056237_Omega-K_Imaging_Algorithm_for_One-Stationary_Bistatic_SAR","5560157_Sidelobe_Reduction_via_Adaptive_FIR_Filtering_in_SAR_Imagery","4146690_Optimization_design_of_NLFM_signal_and_its_pulse_compression_simulation"]}
