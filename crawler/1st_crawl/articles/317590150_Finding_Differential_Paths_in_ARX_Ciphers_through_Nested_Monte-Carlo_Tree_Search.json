{"id":"317590150_Finding_Differential_Paths_in_ARX_Ciphers_through_Nested_Monte-Carlo_Tree_Search","abstract":"We propose the adaptation of Nested Monte-Carlo\nSearch algorithm for finding differential trails in the class\nof ARX ciphers. The practical application of the algorithm\nis demonstrated on round-reduced variants of block ciphers\nfrom the SPECK family. More specifically, we report the best\ndifferential trails,up to 9 rounds, for SPECK32.","authors":["Ashutosh Dhar Dwivedi","Paweł Morawiecki","Sebastian Wójtowicz"],"meta":["April 2018International Journal of Electronics and Telecommunications 0.95(2)","DOI:10.24425/119362","Project: Cryptography"],"references":["292074166_Mastering_the_game_of_Go_with_deep_neural_networks_and_tree_search","220816346_Nested_Monte-Carlo_Search","305421782_Automatic_Search_for_the_Best_Trails_in_ARX_Application_to_Block_Cipher_Speck","283470225_The_SIMON_and_SPECK_lightweight_block_ciphers","268488943_Automatic_Search_for_Differential_Trails_in_ARX_Ciphers"]}
