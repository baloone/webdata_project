{"id":"220701568_GA-Net_A_Genetic_Algorithm_for_Community_Detection_in_Social_Networks","abstract":"The problem of community structure detection in complex networks has been intensively investigated in recent years. In this\npaper we propose a genetic based approach to discover communities in social networks. The algorithm optimizes a simple but\nefficacious fitness function able to identify densely connected groups of nodes with sparse connections between groups. The\nmethod is efficient because the variation operators are modified to take into consideration only the actual correlations among\nthe nodes, thus sensibly reducing the research space of possible solutions. Experiments on synthetic and real life networks\nshow the capability of the method to successfully detect the network structure.","authors":["Clara Pizzuti"],"meta":["January 2008","DOI:10.1007/978-3-540-87700-4_107","SourceDBLP","Conference: Parallel Problem Solving from Nature - PPSN X, 10th International Conference Dortmund, Germany, September 13-17, 2008, Proceedings"],"references":["248519014_An_Information_Flow_Model_for_Conflict_and_Fission_in_Small_Groups1","225356444_Analysis_of_large_social_datasets_by_community_detection","314819165_Natural_communities_in_large_linked_networks","311344563_Finding_community_structure_in_very_large_networks","288913482_Community_Structure_Identification","253253918_Detecting_Community_Structure_in_Networks","243773422_A_genetic_algorithm_for_clustering_problems","223638176_Genetic_clustering_of_social_networks_using_random_walks","222411422_The_Structure_and_Function_of_Complex_Networks","221945992_Community_structure_in_social_and_biological_networks"]}
