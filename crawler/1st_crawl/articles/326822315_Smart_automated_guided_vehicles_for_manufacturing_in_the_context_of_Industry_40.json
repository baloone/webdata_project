{"id":"326822315_Smart_automated_guided_vehicles_for_manufacturing_in_the_context_of_Industry_40","abstract":"Industry 4.0 is the next step for the manufacturing industry by adding internet technologies to optimized automation system. This paper demonstrates automated guided vehicles (AGVs) in a real factory scenario which utilized radio frequency identification (RFID) tags for identification and motion control purposes. The AGVs were tested in a real factory scenario, focusing mainly on two types of AGVs, Karl and Jimmy. They were equipped with RFID readers to detect tags placed on the ground or inside objects. The internal logistics of a smart factoryâ€™s manufacturing environment were demonstrated using the two types of AGVs. It highlighted three aspects which are seldom talked about in order to effectively implement a smart AGV system: reconfigurability, flexibility, and customizability.","authors":["Jasprabhjit Mehami","Mauludin Nawi","Ray Y.
