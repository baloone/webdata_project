{"id":"341970092_Students'_Perception_in_Blended_Learning_among_Science_and_Technology_Cluster_Students","abstract":"Higher education institutions promote flexible learning environment to students in accomplishing learning objectives. By allowing ‘everywhere and anytime’ environment to students for learning plus technical infrastructure, they may have more opportunities to learn and practice their knowledge for achieving success. The purpose of the study is to document and give some elaboration on their experience in blended learning environment. By obtaining result form survey from 139 students with science and technology background, this study highlights three elements of blended learning namely achievement in learning, improvement of learning skill and adoption of social presence. There is a positive perception in blended learning environment among students of Computer Science. According to the results, blended learning in i-Learn platform offers great flexibility, which allows students to have easy access to allows learning at any time and place.","authors":["N Abdul Rahman","N Arifin","Murtaza Manaf","M Ahmad"],"meta":["March 2020Journal of Physics Conference Series 1496(1):012012","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/1496/1/012012"],"references":["330588983_Does_Blended_Learning_Enhance_Student_Engagement_Evidence_from_Higher_Education","325930433_e-Learning_in_Higher_Education_Exploratory_Survey_among_Romanian_Students","325826678_Proposing_an_Expanded_Measure_for_Comparing_OnlineHybrid_to_Face-to-face_Courses","325400959_Online_student_perceptions_of_engagement_transactional_distance_and_outcomes","325099153_The_Webinar_Integration_Tool_A_Framework_for_Promoting_Active_Learning_in_Blended_Environments","345467687_The_impact_of_direct_instruction_in_a_problem-based_learning_setting_Effects_of_a_video-based_training_program_to_foster_preservice_teachers'_professional_vision_of_critical_incidents_in_the_classroom","333604889_Artefact-based_approach_for_improving_social_presence_in_e-learning","332925325_Artefact-based_approach_for_improving_social_presence_in_e-learning","325363987_A_systematic_review_of_cloud_computing_tools_for_collaborative_learning_Opportunities_and_challenges_to_the_blended-learning_environment","323759821_A_Literature_Review_of_the_Factors_Influencing_E-Learning_and_Blended_Learning_in_Relation_to_Learning_Outcome_Student_Satisfaction_and_Engagement"]}
