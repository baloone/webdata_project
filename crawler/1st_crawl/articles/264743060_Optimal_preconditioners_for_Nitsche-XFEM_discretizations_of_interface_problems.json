{"id":"264743060_Optimal_preconditioners_for_Nitsche-XFEM_discretizations_of_interface_problems","abstract":"In the past decade, a combination of unfitted finite elements (or XFEM) with\nthe Nitsche method has become a popular discretization method for elliptic\ninterface problems. This development started with the introduction and analysis\nof this Nitsche-XFEM technique in the paper [A. Hansbo, P. Hansbo, Comput.\nMethods Appl. Mech. Engrg. 191 (2002)]. In general, the resulting linear\nsystems have very large condition numbers, which depend not only on the mesh\nsize $h$, but also on how the interface intersects the mesh. This paper is\nconcerned with the design and analysis of optimal preconditioners for such\nlinear systems. We propose an additive subspace preconditioner which is optimal\nin the sense that the resulting condition number is independent of the mesh\nsize $h$ and the interface position. We further show that already the simple\ndiagonal scaling of the stifness matrix results in a condition number that is\nbounded by $ch^{-2}$, with a constant $c$ that does not depend on the location\nof the interface. Both results are proven for the two-dimensional case. Results\nof numerical experiments in two and three dimensions are presented, which\nillustrate the quality of the preconditioner.","authors":["Christoph Lehrenfeld","Arnold Reusken"],"meta":["February 2017Numerische Mathematik 135(2)","DOI:10.1007/s00211-016-0801-6","SourcearXiv"],"references":["276108563_On_a_Space-Time_Extended_Finite_Element_Method_for_the_Solution_of_a_Class_of_Two-Phase_Mass_Transport_Problems","259763738_Analysis_of_a_DG-XFEM_Discretization_for_a_class_of_two-phase_mass_transport_problems","259763730_Nitsche-XFEM_with_Streamline_Diffusion_Stabilization_for_a_Two-Phase_Mass_Transport_Problem","267241952_VOF-Simulations_of_Mass_Transfer_from_Bubbles_and_Bubble_Chains_Rising_in_Aqueous_Solutions","267125960_Nitsche's_method_for_interface_problems_in_computational_mechanics","265891835_Numerical_Approximation_of_Large_Contrast_Problems_with_the_Unfitted_Nitsche_Method","251527587_Fictitious_domain_finite_element_methods_using_cut_elements_II_A_stabilized_Nitsche_method","248153864_Transport_Phenomena_with_Drops_and_Bubbles","248076809_Thermo-Fluid_Dynamics_Theory_of_Two-Phase_Flow","238690073_A_Finite_Element_method_for_the_simulation_of_strong_and_weak_discontinuities_in_elasticity"]}
