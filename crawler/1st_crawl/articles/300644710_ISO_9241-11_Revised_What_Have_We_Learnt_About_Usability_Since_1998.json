{"id":"300644710_ISO_9241-11_Revised_What_Have_We_Learnt_About_Usability_Since_1998","abstract":"A revision is currently being undertaken of ISO 9241-11, published in 1998 to provide guidance on usability. ISO-9241-11 defines usability in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction in a particular context of use. The intention was to emphasise that usability is an outcome of interaction rather than a property of a product. This is now widely accepted. However, the standard also places emphasis on usability measurement and it is now appreciated that there is more to usability evaluation than measurement. Other developments include an increasing awareness of the importance of the individual userâ€™s emotional experience as discretionary usage of complex consumer products and use of the World Wide Web have became more widespread. From an organisational perspective, it is now appreciated that usability plays an important role in managing the potentials risks that can arise from inappropriate outcomes of interaction. The revision of ISO 9241-11 takes account of these issues and other feedback.","authors":["Nigel Bevan","James Carter","Susan Harker"],"meta":["August 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-20901-2_13","Conference: International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction"],"references":["233864554_Needs_affect_and_interactive_products-Facets_of_user_experience","221508480_Controlling_User_Experience_through_Policing_in_the_Software_Development_Process_Mats_Hellman_Product_Planning_User_Experience","266892453_EXTENDING_THE_CONCEPT_OF_SATISFACTION_IN_ISO_STANDARDS","243536411_Application_of_guidelines_for_designing_user_interface_software","234125611_ISOIEC_9126_Software_engineering_-_Product_quality","228601728_Usability_is_Quality_of_Use","200552972_Guidelines_for_designing_user_interface_software"]}
