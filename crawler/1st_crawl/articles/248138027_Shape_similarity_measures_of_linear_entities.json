{"id":"248138027_Shape_similarity_measures_of_linear_entities","abstract":"The essential of feature matching technology lies in how to measure the similarity of spatial entities. Among all the possible\nsimilarity measures, the shape similarity measure is one of the most important measures because it is easy to collect the\nnecessary parameters and it is also well matched with the human intuition. In this paper a new shape similarity measure of\nlinear entities based on the differences of direction change along each line is presented and its effectiveness is illustrated.","authors":["Qiaoping Zhang","D.
