The European Commission has issued regulations for protecting employees in the workplace from biological hazards. Airborne fungi can be detected and identified by an image-acquisition and interpretation system. In this paper, we present recent results on the development of an automated image acquisition, sample handling and image-interpretation system for airborne fungi identification. We explained the application domain and described the development issues. The development strategy and the architecture of the system are described, and results are presented.
