{"id":"343292678_A_NEW_GENERALIZED_VARENTROPY_AND_ITS_PROPERTIES","abstract":"The variance of Shannon information related to the random variable \\(X\\), which is called varentropy, is a measurement that indicates, how the information content of \\(X\\) is scattered around its entropy and explains its various applications in information theory, computer sciences, and statistics. In this paper, we introduce a new generalized varentropy based on the Tsallis entropy and also obtain some results and bounds for it. We compare the varentropy with the Tsallis varentropy. Moreover, we explain the Tsallis varentropy of the order statistics and analyse this concept in residual (past) lifetime distributions and then introduce two new classes of distributions by them.","authors":["Saeid Maadani","G.
