In power digraphs, the study of cyclic\nstructures and enumeration of components is a difficult task. In this\nmanuscript, we attempt to solve the problem for $p$th power\ncongruences over different classes of residues, where $p$ is an odd\nprime. For any positive integer $m$, we build a digraph $G(p,m)$\nwhose vertex set is $\\mathbb{Z}_{m} = \\{0, 1, 2, 3,..., m-1\\}$ and there will\nbe a directed edge from vertices $u\\in \\mathbb{Z}_{m}$ to $v\\in \\mathbb{Z}_{m} $ if\nand only if $u^{p}\\equiv v~ (\\textmd{mod} ~m)$. We study the structures of\n$G(p,m)$. For the classes of numbers $2^{r}$ and $p^{r}$ where $r\\in\n\\mathbb{Z^{+}}$, we classify cyclic vertices and enumerate components of\n$G(p,m)$. Additionally, we investigate two induced subdigraphs of\n$G(p,m)$ whose vertices are coprime to $m$ and not coprime to $m$,\nrespectively. Finally, we characterize regularity and semiregularity\nof $G(p,m)$ and establish some necessary conditions for cyclicity of\n$G(p,m)$.","authors":["Muhammad Haris Mateen","Muhammad Khalid Mahmood","Dilshad Alghazzawi","Jia-Bao Liu"],"meta":["February 2021AIMS Mathematics 6(5):4581-4596","DOI:10.3934/math.2021270"],"references":["347134939_A_NEW_APPROACH_FOR_THE_ENUMERATION_OF_COMPONENTS_OF_DIGRAPHS_OVER_QUADRATIC_MAPS","338418856_Gromov_Hyperbolicity_in_Directed_Graphs","335723370_Power_Digraphs_Associated_with_the_Congruence_xnequiv_ytextmdmod_m","335469230_Non-Conjugate_Graphs_Associated_With_Finite_Groups","334546013_On_super_totient_numbers_with_applications_and_algorithms_to_graph_labelling","330674081_A_Novel_Labeling_Algorithm_on_Several_Classes_of_Graphs","312500530_Quadratic_Residues_Graphs_274","287535107_The_square_mapping_graphs_of_finite_commutative_rings","283342511_The_iteration_digraphs_of_finite_commutative_rings","275986575_An_Introduction_to_the_Theory_of_Numbers"]}
