{"id":"328828550_Comparison_and_Evaluation_of_Cloud_Processing_Models_in_Cloud-Based_Networks","abstract":"A cloud network refers to a computer network that is inside or part of a cloud computing infrastructure. In this paper we introduce, evaluate and compare models and algorithms that are used to schedule processing in cloud-based networks. The results show that the Buffer-Pool-based scheduling model applies integrated management on all computational tasks as well as the bottom layer of the resource associated with them. In practice, this model solves the management weakness resulting from online parallel processing by using the SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) structure which is defined as a software authorizing model to give permission to use the software to authorized users. This software is hosted on external servers as opposed to on servers situated in-house, which improves the SaaS structure quality service and eliminates the extra energy associated with duplicate computing.","authors":["Ghaidaa Muttasher Abdulsaheb","Ibrahim Osamah","Osamah Ibrahem Khalaf"],"meta":["November 2018International Journal of Simulation: Systems, Science & Technology 19(5)","DOI:10.5013/IJSSST.a.19.05.26"],"references":["296333867_Improving_Ad_Hoc_Network_Performance_by_using_an_Efficient_Cluster_Based_Routing_Algorithm","286863284_Analyzing_Video_Streaming_Quality_by_Using_Various_Error_Correction_Methods_on_Mobile_Ad_hoc_Networks_in_NS2","278663279_Dynamic_Scheduling_of_Requests_Based_on_Impacting_Parameters_in_Cloud_Based_Architectures","257014635_Cost-efficient_task_scheduling_for_executing_large_programs_in_the_cloud","221414906_A_Model_of_Scheduling_Optimizing_for_Cloud_Computing_Resource_Sevices_Based_on_Buffer-pool_Agent","221149146_Cost-Conscious_Scheduling_for_Large_Graph_Processing_in_the_Cloud"]}
