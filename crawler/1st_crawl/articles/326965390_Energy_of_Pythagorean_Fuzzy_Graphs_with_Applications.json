{"id":"326965390_Energy_of_Pythagorean_Fuzzy_Graphs_with_Applications","abstract":"Pythagorean fuzzy sets (PFSs), an extension of intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs), inherit the duality property of IFSs and have a more powerful ability than IFSs to model the obscurity in practical decision-making problems. In this research study, we compute the energy and Laplacian energy of Pythagorean fuzzy graphs (PFGs) and Pythagorean fuzzy digraphs (PFDGs). Moreover, we derive the lower and upper bounds for the energy and Laplacian energy of PFGs. Finally, we present numerical examples, including the design of a satellite communication system and the evaluation of the schemes of reservoir operation to illustrate the applications of our proposed concepts in decision making.","authors":["Muhammad Akram","Sumera Naz"],"meta":["August 2018","DOI:10.3390/math6080136"],"references":["328018950_Multi-Attribute_Decision-Making_Method_Based_on_Neutrosophic_Soft_Rough_Information","328018352_Decision-Making_Approach_Based_on_Neutrosophic_Rough_Information","328017767_A_new_algorithm_for_finding_minimum_spanning_trees_with_undirected_neutrosophic_graphs","326554095_Certain_Notions_of_Energy_in_Single-Valued_Neutrosophic_Graphs","325648934_A_Novel_Approach_to_Decision-Making_with_Pythagorean_Fuzzy_Information","323978555_Graphs_in_an_Intuitionistic_Fuzzy_Soft_Environment","322929658_Path_Laplacian_operators_and_superdiffusive_processes_on_graphs_II_Two-dimensional_case","324771974_Hypergraphs_and_Transversals_of_Hypergraphs_in_Interval-valued_Intuitionistic_Fuzzy_Setting","323670819_Fuzzy_Incidence_Graphs_Applications_to_Human_Trafficking","323001760_Rough_fuzzy_digraphs_with_application"]}
