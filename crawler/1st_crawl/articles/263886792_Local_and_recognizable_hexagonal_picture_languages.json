{"id":"263886792_Local_and_recognizable_hexagonal_picture_languages","abstract":"In this paper we consider hexagonal arrays on triangular grids and introduce hexagonal local picture languages and hexagonal tiling systems defining hexagonal recognizable picture languages, motivated by an analogous study of rectangular arrays by Giammarresi and Restivo. We also introduce hexagonal Wang tiles to define hexagonal Wang systems (HWS) as a formalism to describe hexagonal picture languages. It is noticed that the family of hexagonal picture languages defined by hexagonal Wang systems and the family recognized by hexagonal tiling systems coincide. Analogous to hv-domino systems describing rectangular arrays, we define xyz-domino systems and prove that recognizable hexagonal picture languages are characterized as projections of xyz-local picture languages.","authors":["K.
