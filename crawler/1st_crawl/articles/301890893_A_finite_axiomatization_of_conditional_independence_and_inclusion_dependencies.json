{"id":"301890893_A_finite_axiomatization_of_conditional_independence_and_inclusion_dependencies","abstract":"Abstract We present a complete finite axiomatization of the unrestricted implication problem for inclusion and conditional independence atoms in the context of dependence logic. For databases, this result implies a finite axiomatization of the unrestricted implication problem for inclusion, functional, and embedded multivalued dependencies in the unirelational case. We also indicate the generality of our approach by showing the analogous result for inclusion and embedded join dependencies.","authors":["Miika Hannula","Juha Kontinen"],"meta":["January 2016Information and Computation","DOI:10.1016/j.ic.2016.04.001"],"references":["279632670_Reasoning_About_Embedded_Dependencies_Using_Inclusion_Dependencies","270222525_Propositional_Logics_of_Dependence","258113790_Dependence_Logic_in_Pregeometries_and_omega-Stable_Theories","258083737_RE_Axiomatization_of_Conditional_Independence","256762560_A_Finite_Axiomatization_of_Conditional_Independence_and_Inclusion_Dependencies","236935881_On_Dependence_Logic","230738681_Dependence_and_Independence","220618120_Formal_Systems_for_Tuple_and_Equality_Generating_Dependencies","220616880_The_Implication_Problem_for_Functional_and_Inclusion_Dependencies_is_Undecidable","220432096_A_Proof_Procedure_for_Data_Dependencies","304614300_Dependence_and_Independence_in_Social_Choice_Arrow's_Theorem","258235816_General_Models_and_Entailment_Semantics_for_Independence_Logic","257656199_Independence_in_Database_Relations","236203348_Inclusion_Logic_and_Fixed_Point_Logic","236203247_Axiomatizing_First-Order_Consequences_in_Independence_Logic","230609787_Axiomatizing_First_Order_Consequences_in_Dependence_Logic","222875654_Algebraic_dependencies","222443439_Inclusion_Dependencies_and_Their_Interaction_with_Functional_Dependencies","221591485_Equational_Theories_and_Database_Constraints","220976226_Theory_of_Relations_for_Databases_-_A_Tutorial_Survey","220573319_The_Interaction_of_Integrity_Constraints_in_an_Information_System","220248730_The_Implication_Problem_for_Functional_and_Inclusion_Dependencies","220248230_Corrigendum_to_On_the_undecidability_of_implications_between_embedded_multivalued_database_dependencies_Inform_and_Comput_122_1995_221-235","220247244_On_the_Undecidability_of_Implications_Between_Embedded_Multivalued_Database_Dependencies","220247154_Axioms_and_Algorithms_for_Inferences_Involving_Probabilistic_Independence","220225292_Testing_Implications_of_Data_Dependencies","51910370_Inclusion_and_Exclusion_Dependencies_in_Team_Semantics_On_Some_Logicsof_Imperfect_Information"]}
