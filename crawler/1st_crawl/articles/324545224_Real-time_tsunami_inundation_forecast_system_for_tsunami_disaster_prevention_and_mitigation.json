{"id":"324545224_Real-time_tsunami_inundation_forecast_system_for_tsunami_disaster_prevention_and_mitigation","abstract":"The tsunami disasters that occurred in Indonesia, Chile, and Japan have inflicted serious casualties and damaged social infrastructures. Tsunami forecasting systems are thus urgently required worldwide. We have developed a real-time tsunami inundation forecast system that can complete a tsunami inundation and damage forecast for coastal cities at the level of 10-m grid size in less than 20 min. As the tsunami inundation and damage simulation is a vectorizable memory-intensive program, we incorporate NECâ€™s vector supercomputer SX-ACE. In this paper, we present an overview of our system. In addition, we describe an implementation of the program on SX-ACE and evaluate its performance of SX-ACE in comparison with the cases using an Intel Xeon-based system and the K computer. Then, we clarify that the fulfillment of a real-time tsunami inundation forecast system requires a system with high-performance cores connected to the memory subsystem at a high memory bandwidth such as SX-ACE.","authors":["Akihiro Musa","Osamu Watanabe","Hiroshi Matsuoka","Hiroaki Hokari"],"meta":["July 2018The Journal of Supercomputing 74(2)","DOI:10.1007/s11227-018-2363-0"],"references":["305244019_Computationally_Efficient_Tsunami_Modeling_on_Graphics_Processing_Units_GPUs","278332452_Characteristics_of_Emergency_Response_at_the_Great_East_Japan_Earthquake","266868450_Damage_due_to_the_2011_Tohoku_earthquake_tsunami_and_its_lessons_for_future_mitigation","313143430_Internal_deformation_due_to_shear_and_tensile_faults_in_a_half-spaceJ","311843080_FPGA-based_Tsunami_Simulation_Performance_Comparison_with_GPUs_and_Roofline_Model_for_Scalability_Analysis","306323076_Development_of_High_Precision_Tsunami_Runup_Calculation_Method_Based_on_a_Hierarchical_Simulation","301210048_SX-ACE_Brand-New_Vector_Supercomputer_for_Higher_Sustained_Performance_I","301172249_Earthquake_and_Tsunami_Warning_System_for_Natural_Disaster_Prevention","271856226_Near-Field_Tsunami_Inundation_Forecast_Using_the_Parallel_TUNAMI-N2_Model_Application_to_the_2011_Tohoku-Oki_Earthquake_Combined_with_Source_Inversions","266439966_Real-Time_Tsunami_Simulation_on_Multi-node_GPU_Cluster"]}
