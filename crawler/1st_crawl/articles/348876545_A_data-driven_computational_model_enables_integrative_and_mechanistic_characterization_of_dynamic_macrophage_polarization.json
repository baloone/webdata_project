{"id":"348876545_A_data-driven_computational_model_enables_integrative_and_mechanistic_characterization_of_dynamic_macrophage_polarization","abstract":"Macrophages are highly plastic immune cells that dynamically integrate microenvironmental signals to shape their own functional phenotypes, a process known as polarization. Here we develop a large-scale mechanistic computational model that for the first time enables a systems-level characterization, from quantitative, temporal, dose-dependent, and single-cell perspectives, of macrophage polarization driven by a complex multi-pathway signaling network. The model was extensively calibrated and validated against literature and focused in-house experimental data. Using the model, we generated dynamic phenotype maps in response to numerous combinations of polarizing signals; we also probed into an in silico population of model-based macrophages to examine the impact of polarization continuum at the single-cell level. Additionally, we analyzed the model under an in vitro condition of peripheral arterial disease to evaluate strategies that can potentially induce therapeutic macrophage repolarization. Our model is a key step toward the future development of a network-centric, comprehensive “virtual macrophage” simulation platform.","authors":["Chen Zhao","Thalyta Medeiros","Richard J.
