{"id":"273313905_Knowledge_Level_Assessment_in_e-Learning_Systems_Using_Machine_Learning_and_User_Activity_Analysis","abstract":"Electronic Learning has been one of the foremost trends in education so far. Such importance draws the attention to an important shift in the educational paradigm. Due to the complexity of the evolving paradigm, the prospective dynamics of learning require an evolution of knowledge delivery and evaluation. This research work tries to put in hand a futuristic design of an autonomous and intelligent e-Learning system. In which machine learning and user activity analysis play the role of an automatic evaluator for the knowledge level. It is important to assess the knowledge level in order to adapt content presentation and to have more realistic evaluation of online learners. Several classification algorithms are applied to predict the knowledge level of the learners and the corresponding results are reported. Furthermore, this research proposes a modern design of a dynamic learning environment that goes along the most recent trends in e-Learning. The experimental results illustrate an overall performance superiority of a support vector machine model in evaluating the knowledge levels; having 98.6\\% of correctly classified instances with 0.0069 mean absolute error.","authors":["Nazeeh Ghatasheh"],"meta":["April 2015International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications 6(4):107-113","DOI:10.14569/IJACSA.2015.060415"],"references":["287676507_Automatic_Evaluation_for_E-Learning_Using_Latent_Semantic_Analysis_A_Use_Case","284043217_ROC_Graphs_Notes_and_Practical_Considerations_for_Researchers","275544467_E-learning_in_the_Evaluation_of_Students_and_Teachers_LMS_or_Social_Networks","275541006_Statistical_Analysis_of_the_Behavior_for_Mobile_E-learning","307881957_LIBSVM_A_library_for_support_vector_machines","306150595_Neural_Networks_A_Comprehensive_Foundation","300020734_College_Students'_Attitudes_and_Preferences_of_Mobile_Newspaper_Reading_A_Comparison_Between_Printed_and_Web_Page_Layout","288906520_Random_forests","278662364_A_Weighted_Concept_Map_Approach_to_Generate_Learning_Guidance_in_Science_Courses","272423685_Effects_of_concept_map_extraction_and_a_test-based_diagnostic_environment_on_learning_achievement_and_learners'_perceptions_Effects_of_CM_extraction_with_test-based_diagnosis","271772289_Evolution_and_Evaluation_of_e-learning","271589448_A_Pattern_Oriented_Approach_for_Designing_Scalable_Analytics_Applications_Invited_Talk","270846259_Investigating_Students'_Satisfaction_and_Continuance_Intention_toward_E-learning_An_Extension_of_the_Expectation_-_Confirmation_Model","265687777_Empirical_Investigation_of_E-Learning_Acceptance_and_Assimilation_A_Structural_Equation_Model","266148445_A_hybrid_cognitive_assessment_based_on_ontology_knowledge_map_and_skills"]}
