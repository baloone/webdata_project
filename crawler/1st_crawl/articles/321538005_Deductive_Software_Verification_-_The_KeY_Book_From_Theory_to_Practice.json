{"id":"321538005_Deductive_Software_Verification_-_The_KeY_Book_From_Theory_to_Practice","abstract":"Static analysis of software with deductive methods is a highly dynamic field\nof research on the verge of becoming a mainstream technology in software\nengineering. It consists of a large portfolio of - mostly fully automated -\nanalyses: formal verification, test generation, security analysis,\nvisualization, and debugging. All of them are realized in the state-of-art\ndeductive verification framework KeY.\n\nThis book is the definitive guide to KeY that lets you explore the full\npotential of deductive software verification in practice. It contains the\ncomplete theory behind KeY for active researchers who want to understand it in\ndepth or use it in their own work. But the book also features fully\nself-contained chapters on the Java Modeling Language and on Using KeY that\nrequire nothing else than familiarity with Java. All other chapters are\naccessible for graduate students (M.Sc. level and beyond).<\n<\nThe KeY framework is free and open software, downloadable from the book\ncompanion website which contains also all code examples mentioned in this\nbook.","authors":["Wolfgang Ahrendt","Bernhard Beckert","Richard Bubel","Reiner HÃ¤hnle"],"meta":["January 2016Lecture Notes in Computer Science 10001","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-49812-6","ISBN: 978-3-319-49811-9"],"references":[]}
