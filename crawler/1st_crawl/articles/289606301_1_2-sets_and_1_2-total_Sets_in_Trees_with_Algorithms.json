{"id":"289606301_1_2-sets_and_1_2-total_Sets_in_Trees_with_Algorithms","abstract":"A set S subset of V of the graph G = (V, E) is called a [1, 2]-set of G if any vertex which is not in S has at least one but no more than two neighbors in S.A set S' subset of V is called a [1, 2]-total set of G if any vertex of G, no matter in S' or not, is adjacent to at least one but not more than two vertices in S'. In this paper we introduce a linear algorithm for finding the cardinality of the smallest [1, 2]-sets and [1, 2]-total sets of a tree and extend it to a more generalized version for [i, j]-sets, a generalization of [1, 2]-sets. This answers one of the open problems proposed in Chellali et al. (2013). Then since not all trees have [1, 2]-total sets, we devise a recursive method for generating all the trees that do have such sets. This method also constructs every [1, 2]-total set of each tree that it generates.","authors":["Amir Kafshdar Goharshady","Mohammad Reza Hooshmandasl","Mohammad Reza Meybodi"],"meta":["January 2016Discrete Applied Mathematics 198:136-146","DOI:10.1016/j.dam.2015.06.014"],"references":["265574151_Rainbow_domination_in_graphs","265396557_Independent_1k-sets_in_graphs","263281352_Total_12-domination_in_graphs","257585899_The_domination_number_of_Cartesian_product_of_two_directed_paths","220693653_Fundamentals_of_Data_Structure_in_C","267660892_12-sets_in_graphs","264932618_Perfect_domination","257145351_On_the_mixed_domination_problem_in_graphs","257145230_Complexity_of_distance_paired-domination_problem_in_graphs","247003662_On_domination_and_independent_domination_number_of_graphs","242619830_Fundamentals_of_Domination_in_Graphs","238672469_Fundamentals_of_Data_Structures_in_Pascal","229531151_Total_domination_in_graphs","227627902_Minimum_Independent_Dominating_Sets_of_Random_Cubic_Graphs","223159038_On_approximating_the_minimum_independent_dominating_set","221933085_Introduction_To_Graph_Theory","220398109_Girth_and_Total_Domination_in_Graphs","220153183_Hardness_results_and_approximation_algorithms_for_weighted_paired-domination_in_graphs","220152961_The_algorithmic_complexity_of_mixed_domination_in_graphs","220081650_Efficient_Open_Domination"]}
