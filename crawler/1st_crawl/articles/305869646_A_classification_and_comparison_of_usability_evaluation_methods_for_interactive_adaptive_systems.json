{"id":"305869646_A_classification_and_comparison_of_usability_evaluation_methods_for_interactive_adaptive_systems","abstract":"Usability is a crucial factor for interactive adaptive system success. Several methods have been proposed to support the usability evaluation of interactive adaptive systems. However, the diversity of these methods leaves the evaluators wondering what would be the most appropriate usability evaluation methods for their specific goals. This paper examines the characteristics of usability evaluation methods for interactive adaptive systems and identifies the most relevant features for categorizing them. The comparison and classification of these methods will serve as a reference for researchers in the field of interactive adaptive systems and as a guide for the choice of suitable usability evaluation methods.","authors":["Amira Dhouib","Trabelsi Abdelwaheb","Christophe Kolski","Mahmoud Neji"],"meta":["July 2016","DOI:10.1109/HSI.2016.7529639","Conference: 2016 9th International Conference on Human System Interactions (HSI)At: Portsmouth , UK"],"references":["305284399_A_framework_for_supporting_the_choice_of_usability_evaluation_methods_for_interactive_adaptive_systems","281968723_Design_and_Usability_Evaluation_of_Adaptive_E-learning_Systems_based_on_Learner_Knowledge_and_Learning_Style","244307521_Integrating_Layered_and_Heuristic_Evaluation_for_Adaptive_Learning_Environments","228389808_The_user_as_wizard_A_method_for_early_involvement_in_the_design_and_evaluation_of_adaptive_systems","286734717_Layered_Evaluation_for_Data_Discovery_and_Recommendation_Systems_An_Initial_Set_of_Principles","246366190_Heuristic_evaluation_of_users_interfaces-Proc","242375192_Usability_engineering_at_a_discount","238122690_Heuristic_Evaluation_In_Usability_Inspection_Methods","235584562_Design_At_Work_Cooperative_Design_of_Computer_Systems","229068111_Adaptive_Interfaces_and_Agents"]}
