{"id":"304253236_Artificial_neural_network_modeling_of_the_water_quality_index_for_Kinta_River_Malaysia_using_water_quality_variables_as_predictors","abstract":"This article describes design and application of feed-forward, fully-connected, three-layer perceptron\nneural network model for computing the water quality index (WQJ)1 for Kinta River (Malaysia). The modeling\nefforts showed that the optimal network architecture was 23-34-1 and that the best WQI predictions\nwere associated with the quick propagation (Qf') training algorithm; a learning rate of0.06; and a Qf' coefficient\nof 1.75. The WQJ predictions of this model had significant, positive, very high correlation (r= 0.977,\np < 0.01) with the measure:~ WQI values, implying that the model predictions explain around 95.4% of the\nvariation in the measured WQJ values.\nThe approach presented in this article offers useful and powerful alternative to WQJ computation and\nprediction, especially in the case of WQI calculation methods which involve lengthy computations and\nuse of various sub-index formulae for each value, or range of values, of the constituent water quality\nvariables.","authors":["Dr. Nabeel M.
