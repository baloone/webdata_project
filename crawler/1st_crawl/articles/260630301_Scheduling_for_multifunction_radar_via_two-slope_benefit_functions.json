{"id":"260630301_Scheduling_for_multifunction_radar_via_two-slope_benefit_functions","abstract":"The scheduling of tracking and surveillance looks for multifunction radar is considered. A technique called the sequential scheduler is proposed, whereby tracking looks and high-priority surveillance looks are scheduled first, and lower-priority surveillance looks are then scheduled to occupy gaps in the radar time line. A method called the two-slope benefit function (TSBF) sub-scheduler is used and requires that each tracking look and high-priority surveillance look has a benefit function, which specifies benefit as a function of start time. This method accounts for both look priority and target dynamics in formulating a look schedule. If the radar is overloaded with tracking look requests, the TSBF sub-scheduler down-selects a set of looks that can be scheduled, using a method that favours higher priority looks. Looks are scheduled to maximise the total benefit, and it is shown that the resulting maximisation is equivalent to a linear program which can be solved efficiently using the simplex method. A technique called the gap-filling sub-scheduler is used to schedule lower-priority surveillance looks. An example is presented which illustrates the properties of the sequential scheduler.","authors":["P.W.
