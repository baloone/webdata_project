{"id":"304753484_Data_Security_and_Privacy_in_the_IoT","abstract":"Deploying existing data security solutions to the Internet of Things (IoT) is not straightforward because of device het-erogeneity, highly dynamic and possibly unprotected environments , and large scale. In this paper, after outlining key challenges in data security and privacy, we summarize research directions for securing IoT data, including efficient and scalable encryption protocols, software protection techniques for small devices, and fine-grained data packet loss analysis for sensor networks.","authors":["Elisa Bertino"],"meta":["January 2016","DOI:10.5441/002/edbt.2016.02"],"references":[]}
