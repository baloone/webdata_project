Many previous\nstudies had addressed the influencing factors of user\nacceptance and intention to use MBA. In order to adopt\nMBA in an educational environment, the influencing factors\nto student intention need to be investigated. Hence, this\ncurrent study attempts to determine the impact of the factors\nrelated to internal assessment environment on the tertiarylevel\nstudents’ intent to use MBA from the standpoint of the\nmotivation factors. A total of 90 mathematics and computer\nscience undergraduates participated in a survey on the\nadoption of MBA after a real experiment of mobile based\nassessment. Data analysis used the structural equation\nmodeling (SEM). The findings reveal that the students’\nintention to adopt MBA can be predicted and explained by\nseveral key motivational drivers i.e. Usefulness, Ease of Use\nand Enjoyment. Based on the findings, motivation to learn,\neducational assessment content, and the navigation system\ndesign of MBAs can be enhanced by satisfying the three\naforementioned motivational factors.","authors":["Ali Alrfooh"],"meta":["February 2020International Journal of Advanced Trends in Computer Science and Engineering 9(1):440-453","DOI:10.30534/ijatcse/2020/61912020"],"references":["338283034_Analysis_the_Effect_of_Different_Factors_on_the_Development_of_Mobile_Learning_Applications_at_Different_Stages_of_Usage","329211127_Analysis_of_the_essential_factors_affecting_of_intention_to_use_of_mobile_learning_applications_A_comparison_between_universities_adopters_and_non-adopters","316188597_BYOD_or_not_A_comparison_of_two_assessment_strategies_for_student_learning","309417963_An_Outdoor_Mobile-Based_Assessment_Activity_Measuring_Students'_Motivation_and_Acceptance","325652254_Mobile-based_assessment_A_literature_review_of_publications_in_major_referred_journals_from_2009_to_2018","322588202_Using_digital_technology_to_enhance_formative_assessment_in_mathematics_classrooms_Using_digital_technology_in_formative_assessment","314760887_Mobile-based_assessment_Investigating_the_factors_that_influence_behavioral_intention_to_use","312984568_Perceived_usefulness_perceived_ease_and_user_acceptance_of_information_technology","311670129_Integration_of_mobile_AR_T_echnology_in_performance_assessment","310746416_Mobile-Based_Assessment_Integrating_acceptance_and_motivational_factors_into_a_combined_model_of_Self-Determination_Theory_and_Technology_Acceptance"]}
