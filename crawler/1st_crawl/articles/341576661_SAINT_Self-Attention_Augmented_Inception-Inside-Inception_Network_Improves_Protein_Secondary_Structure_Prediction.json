{"id":"341576661_SAINT_Self-Attention_Augmented_Inception-Inside-Inception_Network_Improves_Protein_Secondary_Structure_Prediction","abstract":"Motivation: \nProtein structures provide basic insight into how they can interact with other proteins, their functions and biological roles in an organism. Experimental methods (e.g., X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy) for predicting the secondary structure (SS) of proteins are very expensive and time consuming. Therefore, developing efficient computational approaches for predicting the secondary structure of protein is of utmost importance. Advances in developing highly accurate SS prediction methods have mostly been focused on 3-class (Q3) structure prediction. However, 8-class (Q8) resolution of secondary structure contains more useful information and is much more challenging than the Q3 prediction.\n\nResults: \nWe present SAINT, a highly accurate method for Q8 structure prediction, which incorporates self-attention mechanism (a concept from natural language processing) with the Deep Inception-Inside-Inception (Deep3I) network in order to effectively capture both the short-range and long-range interactions among the amino acid residues. SAINT offers a more interpretable framework than the typical black-box deep neural network methods. Through an extensive evaluation study, we report the performance of SAINT in comparison with the existing best methods on a collection of benchmark datasets, namely, TEST2016, TEST2018, CASP12 and CASP13. Our results suggest that self-attention mechanism improves the prediction accuracy and outperforms the existing best alternate methods. SAINT is the first of its kind and offers the best known Q8 accuracy. Thus, we believe SAINT represents a major step towards the accurate and reliable prediction of secondary structures of proteins.\n\nAvailability: \nSAINT is freely available as an open source project at https://github.com/SAINTProtein/SAINT.\n\nSupplementary information: \nSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","authors":["Mostofa Rafid Uddin","Sazan Mahbub","M Saifur Rahman","Md.
