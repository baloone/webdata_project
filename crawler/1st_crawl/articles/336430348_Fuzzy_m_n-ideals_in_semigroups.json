{"id":"336430348_Fuzzy_m_n-ideals_in_semigroups","abstract":"In this paper, we introduce the concept of a fuzzy (m, n)-ideal, fuzzy (m, 0)-ideal and fuzzy (0, n)-ideal of a semigroup S for any positive integers m and n. This generalizes the concept of a fuzzy bi-ideal, fuzzy right ideal and fuzzy left ideal. After that, some properties of a fuzzy (m, n)-ideal, fuzzy (m, 0)-ideal and fuzzy (0, n)-ideal have been investigated. We also characterize different classes of semigroups ((m, n)-regular, (m, 0)-regular, (0, n)-regular) in terms of its fuzzy (m, n)-ideals, fuzzy (m, 0)-ideals and fuzzy (0, n)-ideals, respectively.","authors":["Ahsan Mahboob","Bijan Davvaz","Noor Mohammad Khan"],"meta":["October 2019","DOI:10.1007/s40314-019-0930-5"],"references":["310733971_On_mn-ideals_in_LA-semigroups","302984561_On_m_n-ideals_and_m_n-regular_ordered_semigroups","226866023_Fuzzy_Sets_in_Ordered_Groupoids","316692777_Studies_in_Fuzziness_and_Soft_Computing","282481295_Studies_in_Fuzziness_and_Soft_Computing","268764679_Notes_on_mn-ideals_III","268739873_On_mn-ideals_in_regular_duo_semigroups","268072402_On_prime_mn_bi-ideals_and_rough_prime_mn_bi-ideals_in_semigroups","267434905_On_0-minimal_0_2-bi-ideals_in_ordered_semigroups","267162094_A_characterization_of_0-minimal_mn-ideals","267114606_On_mn-regular_semigroups","267050652_On_mn-ideals_and_mn-regular_semigroups","266942822_On_0-minimal_mn-ideals_in_an_ordered_semigroup","266840344_A_characterization_of_semigroups_that_are_n_-regular_with_reciprocity","266191439_Notes_on_regular_semigroups","265585348_Left_quasi-regular_and_intra-regular_ordered_semigroups_using_fuzzy_ideals","265439718_Generalized_ideals_in_semigroups","265423805_Fuzzy_bi-ideals_in_Semigroups","256720661_Fuzzy_bi-ideals_in_ordered_semigroups","256410233_On_fuzzy_ideals_and_fuzzy_bi-ideals_in_semigroups","251046189_Notes_on_left_mn_right-ideals_I","243007033_Fuzzy_Groups","222639042_On_fuzzy_semigroups","222588447_Fuzzy_semiprime_ideals_in_semigroups","222439366_Fuzzy_Sets","222418173_Neumann_problems_and_isocapacitary_inequalities","220311788_Regular_ordered_semigroups_in_terms_of_fuzzy_subsets","220310858_The_embedding_of_an_ordered_groupoid_into_a_poe-groupoid_in_terms_of_fuzzy_sets","38388236_Notes_on_left_mn_right-ideals_II","23552155_Characterizations_of_ordered_semigroups_by_the_properties_of_their_fuzzy_generalized_bi-ideals"]}
