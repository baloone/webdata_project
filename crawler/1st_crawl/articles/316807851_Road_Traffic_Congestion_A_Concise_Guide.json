{"id":"316807851_Road_Traffic_Congestion_A_Concise_Guide","abstract":"This book on road traffic congestion in cities and suburbs describes congestion problems and shows how they can be relieved. The first part (Chapters 1-3) shows how congestion reflects transportation technologies and settlement patterns. The second part (Chapters 4-13) describes the causes, characteristics, and consequences of congestion. The third part (Chapters 14-23) presents various relief strategies—including supply adaptation and demand mitigation—for nonrecurring and recurring congestion. The last part (Chapter 24) gives general guidelines for congestion relief and provides a general outlook for the future. The book will be useful for a wide audience—including students, practitioners and researchers in a variety of professional endeavors: traffic engineers, transportation planners, public transport specialists, city planners, public administrators, and private enterprises that depend on transportation for their activities.","authors":["John C.
