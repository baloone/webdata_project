{"id":"347190032_Turing_number_how_far_are_you_to_A_M_Turing_award","abstract":"The ACM A.M. Turing Award is commonly acknowledged as the highest distinction in the realm of computer science. Since 1960s, it has been awarded to computer scientists who made outstanding contributions. The significance of this award is far-reaching to the laureates as well as their research teams. However, unlike the Nobel Prize that has been extensively investigated, little research has been done to explore this most important award. To this end, we propose the Turing Number ( TN ) index to measure how far a specific scholar is to this award. Inspired by previous works on Erdos Number and Bacon Number, this index is defined as the shortest path between a given scholar to any Turing Award Laureate. Experimental results suggest that TN can reflect the closeness of collaboration between scholars and Turing Award Laureates. With the correlation analysis between TN and metrics from the bibliometric-level and network-level, we demonstrate that TN has the potential of reflecting a scholar's academic influence and reputation.","authors":["Feng Xia","Jiaying Liu","Jing Ren","Wei Wang"],"meta":["November 2020ACM SIGWEB Newsletter","DOI:10.1145/3427478.3427483"],"references":["343478626_Data-Driven_Computational_Social_Science_A_Survey","343213250_Web_of_Scholars_A_Scholar_Knowledge_Graph","342755492_Quantifying_Success_in_Science_An_Overview","341766189_The_Gene_of_Scientific_Success","337879560_API_An_Index_for_Quantifying_a_Scholar's_Academic_Potential","337449492_The_Evolution_of_Turing_Award_Collaboration_Network_Bibliometric-Level_and_Network-Level_Metrics","336456173_Shifu2_A_Network_Representation_Learning_Based_Model_for_Advisor-advisee_Relationship_Mining","319277890_Turing_laureates_celebrate_award's_50_th_anniversary","318030936_A_close_look_at_China's_rise","312640644_Celebrating_50_Years_of_the_Turing_Award"]}
