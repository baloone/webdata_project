{"id":"353800326_Tsunami-Related_Data_A_Review_of_Available_Repositories_Used_in_Scientific_Literature","abstract":"Various organizations and institutions store large volumes of tsunami-related data, whose availability and quality should benefit society, as it improves decision making before the tsunami occurrence, during the tsunami impact, and when coping with the aftermath. However, the existing digital ecosystem surrounding tsunami research prevents us from extracting the maximum benefit from our research investments. The main objective of this study is to explore the field of data repositories providing secondary data associated with tsunami research and analyze the current situation. We analyze the mutual interconnections of references in scientific studies published in the Web of Science database, governmental bodies, commercial organizations, and research agencies. A set of criteria was used to evaluate content and searchability. We identified 60 data repositories with records used in tsunami research. The heterogeneity of data formats, deactivated or nonfunctional web pages, the generality of data repositories, or poor dataset arrangement represent the most significant weak points. We outline the potential contribution of ontology engineering as an example of computer science methods that enable improvements in tsunami-related data management.","authors":["Tomáš Nacházel","Frantisek Babic","Marco Baiguera","Pavel Čech"],"meta":["August 2021Water 13(16):2177","DOI:10.3390/w13162177"],"references":["351370258_Integration_of_a_geo-ontology-based_knowledge_model_and_spatial_analysis_into_emergency_response_for_geologic_hazards","351140840_Probabilistic_Tsunami_Hazard_and_Risk_Analysis_A_Review_of_Research_Gaps","349865889_Geochemical_approaches_in_tsunami_research_current_knowledge_and_challenges","349639249_Multilayer-HySEA_model_validation_for_landslide-generated_tsunamis_-_Part_2_Granular_slides","349047462_GNSS_total_variometric_approach_first_demonstration_of_a_tool_for_real-time_tsunami_genesis_estimation","349046051_Synthetic_analysis_of_the_efficacy_of_the_S-net_system_in_tsunami_forecasting","348696614_Onshore_flow_characteristics_of_the_1755_CE_Lisbon_tsunami_Linking_forward_and_inverse_numerical_modeling","350455609_Runup_of_landslide-generated_waves_breaking_on_steep_slopes_captured_using_digital_imagery_and_hydrochromic_paint","349752613_Tsunami_simulation_for_disaster_mitigation_based_on_earthquake_scenarios_in_the_Molucca_subduction_zone_case_study_of_the_Molucca_Sea_earthquake_on_July_7_2019","349509951_A_three-dimensional_non-hydrostatic_model_for_tsunami_waves_generated_by_submarine_landslides"]}
