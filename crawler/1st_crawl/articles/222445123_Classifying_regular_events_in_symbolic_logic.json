{"id":"222445123_Classifying_regular_events_in_symbolic_logic","abstract":"Regular events have been classified by star-height, star-free events by the “dot-depth hierarchy,” and events of dot-depth one by the so-called β-hierarchy. It is shown here that the latter two hierarchies have appealing characterizations in symbolic logic: Referring to a first-order language L in which star-free events are described, an event is shown to be of dot-depth n iff it is defined by a Boolean combination of L-sentences in prenex normal form with a Σn-prefix. The β-hierarchy is characterized by the quantifier-rank of L-sentences with Σ1-prefix. A similar characterization of star-height would require the inclusion of weak monadic second-order quantifiers; it is shown that the natural classification of events depending on these quantifiers will not yield on infinite hierarchy.","authors":["Wolfgang Thomas"],"meta":["December 1982Journal of Computer and System Sciences 25(3):360-376","DOI:10.1016/0022-0000(82)90016-2","SourceDBLP"],"references":["312703888_An_application_of_games_to_the_completness_problem_for_formalized_theories","267014276_Distributive_Normal_Forms_in_First-Order_Logic","243781008_Characterizations_of_locally_testable_languages","242942915_Weak_Second-Order_Arithmetic_and_Finite_Automata","242589446_Application_of_games_to_the_completness_problem_for_formalised_theories","242503066_Model-theoretic_methods_in_the_study_of_elementary_logic","239494065_Decision_problems_of_finite_automation_design_and_related_decision_problems","226804321_The_theory_of_successor_with_an_extra_predicate","223687719_Dot-Depth_of_Star-Free_Events","222437820_The_dot-depth_hierarchy_of_star-free_languages_is_infinite","220247451_Application_of_Model_Theoretic_Games_to_Discrete_Linear_Orders_and_Finite_Automata","220165363_Hierarchies_of_Aperiodic_Languages","38322945_Transition_graphs_and_the_star-height_of_regular_events","30820588_Decision_Problems_of_Finite_Automata_Design_and_Related_Arithmetics","4355889_Characterizations_of_locally_testable_events"]}
