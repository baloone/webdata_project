{"id":"346283959_Dataset_of_COVID-19_outbreak_and_potential_predictive_features_in_the_USA","abstract":"This dataset provides information related to the outbreak of COVID-19 disease in the United States, including data from each of 3142 US counties from the beginning of the outbreak (January 2020) until September 2020. This data is collected from many public online databases and includes the daily number of COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths, as well as 33 features that may be relevant to the pandemic dynamics: demographic, geographic, climatic, traffic, public-health, social-distancing-policy adherence, and political characteristics of each county. We anticipate many researchers will use this dataset to train models that can predict the spread of COVID-19 and to identify the key driving factors.","authors":["Arezoo Haratian","Hadi Fazelinia","Zeinab Maleki","Pouria Ramazi"],"meta":["October 2020","DOI:10.1101/2020.10.16.20214098"],"references":["342553610_Analysis_on_Novel_Coronavirus_COVID-19_Using_Machine_Learning_Methods","220263062_Missing_Value_Estimation_Methods_for_DNA_Microarrays","342511772_A_SIR_model_assumption_for_the_spread_of_COVID-19_in_different_communities","340177686_Data_Structures_for_Statistical_Computing_in_Python"]}
