{"id":"248135016_The_parallel_3D_magnetotelluric_forward_modeling_algorithm","abstract":"The workload of the 3D magnetotelluric forward modeling algorithm is so large that the traditional serial algorithm costs\nan extremely large compute time. However, the 3D forward modeling algorithm can process the data in the frequency domain,\nwhich is very suitable for parallel computation. With the advantage of MPI and based on an analysis of the flow of the 3D\nmagnetotelluric serial forward algorithm, we suggest the idea of parallel computation and apply it. Three theoretical models\nare tested and the execution efficiency is compared in different situations. The results indicate that the parallel 3D forward\nmodeling computation is correct and the efficiency is greatly improved. This method is suitable for large size geophysical\ncomputations.","authors":["Handong Tan","Tong Tuo","Lin Changhong"],"meta":["December 2006Applied Geophysics 3(4):197-202","DOI:10.1007/s11770-006-4001-5"],"references":["264608950_Three-Dimensional_Magnetotelluric_Modeling_using_the_Staggered-Grid_Finite_Difference_Method","260743549_Three-Dimensional_Rapid_Relaxation_Inversion_for_the_Magnetotelluric_Method","249863420_The_effect_of_a_fault_on_the_Earth's_natural_electromagnetic_field"]}
