{"id":"321609403_Multivariate_Geostatistics_An_Introduction_with_Applications","abstract":"The book provides the applied scientist, engineer or statistician with an introduction to geostatistics stressing the multivariate aspects. Geostatistics offers a variety of models, methods and techniques for the analysis, estimation and display of multivariate data distributed in space or time. The book presents a brief review of statistical concepts, a detailed introduction to linear geostatistics, and an account of three basic methods of multivariate analysis. Moreover, it presents an advanced presentation of linear models for multivariate spatial or temporal data, including the recent bilinear model of coregionalization, and an introduction to non stationary geostatistics with a special focus on the external drift method.","authors":["Hans Wackernagel"],"meta":["January 1995","DOI:10.1007/978-3-662-03098-1","ISBN: 978-3-662-03100-1"],"references":[]}
