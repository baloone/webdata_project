{"id":"299070515_Numerical_solution_to_the_Vlasov_equation_the_2D_code","abstract":"The present code solves the two-dimensional Vlasov equation for a periodic in space system, in presence of an external magnetic field B-o. The self coherent electric field given by Poisson equation is computed by Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The output of the code consist of a list of diagnostics, such as total mass conservation, total momentum and energies, and of projections of the distribution function in different subspaces as the x-u(x) space, the x-y space and so on, (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.","authors":["E Fijalkow"],"meta":["February 1999Computer Physics Communications 116(2-3):336-344","DOI:10.1016/S0010-4655(98)00148-9"],"references":["236520271_Note_on_prime_factor_FFT_algorithms","222718248_Numerical_solution_to_the_Vlasov_equation_The_1D_code","37537038_A_Novel_Technique_for_the_Numerical_Simulation_of_Hot_Collision-Free_Plasma_Vlasov_Hybrid_Simulation"]}
