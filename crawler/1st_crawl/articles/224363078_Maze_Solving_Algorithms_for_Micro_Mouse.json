{"id":"224363078_Maze_Solving_Algorithms_for_Micro_Mouse","abstract":"The problem of micro-mouse is 30 years old but its importance in the field of robotics is unparalleled, as it requires a complete analysis & proper planning to be solved. This paper covers one of the most important areas of robot, ldquodecision making algorithmrdquo or in lay-manpsilas language, ldquorobot intelligencerdquo. For starting in the field of micro-mouse it is very difficult to begin with highly sophisticated algorithms. This paper begins with very basic wall follower logic to solve the maze. And gradually improves the algorithm to accurately solve the maze in shortest time with some more intelligence. The Algorithm is developed up to some sophisticated level as flood-fill algorithm. The paper would help all the beginners in this fascinating field, as they proceed towards development of the ldquobrain of the systemrdquo, particularly for robots concerned with path planning and navigation.","authors":["Swati Mishra","Pankaj Bande"],"meta":["January 2009","DOI:10.1109/SITIS.2008.104","SourceIEEE Xplore","Conference: Signal Image Technology and Internet Based Systems, 2008.
