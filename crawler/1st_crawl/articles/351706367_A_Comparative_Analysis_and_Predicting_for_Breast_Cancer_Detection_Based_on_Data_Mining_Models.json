{"id":"351706367_A_Comparative_Analysis_and_Predicting_for_Breast_Cancer_Detection_Based_on_Data_Mining_Models","abstract":"Breast cancer is one of the most common diseases among women, accounting for many deaths each year. Even though cancer can be treated and cured in its early stages, many patients are diagnosed at a late stage. Data mining is the method of finding or extracting information from massive databases or datasets, and it is a field of computer science with a lot of potentials. It covers a wide range of areas, one of which is classification. Classification may also be accomplished using a variety of methods or algorithms. With the aid of MATLAB, five classification algorithms were compared. This paper presents a performance comparison among the classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistics Regression (LR), K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN), Weighted K-Nearest Neighbors (Weighted K-NN), and Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes (Gaussian NB). The data set was taken from UCI Machine learning Repository. The main objective of this study is to classify breast cancer women using the application of machine learning algorithms based on their accuracy. The results have revealed that Weighted K-NN (96.7%) has the highest accuracy among all the classifiers.","authors":["Shler Farhad Khorshid","Adnan Mohsin Abdulazeez","Amira Bibo Sallow"],"meta":["May 2021","DOI:10.9734/AJRCOS/2021/v8i430209"],"references":["350193297_Ultrasound_Medical_Images_Classification_Based_on_Deep_Learning_Algorithms_A_Review","350193089_The_Role_of_Machine_Learning_Algorithms_for_Diagnosing_Diseases","349573253_BREAST_CANCER_DIAGNOSIS_BASED_ON_K-NEAREST_NEIGHBORS_A_REVIEW_PJAEE_18_4_2021_BREAST_CANCER_DIAGNOSIS_BASED_ON_K-NEAREST_NEIGHBORS_A_REVIEW","345681488_I_DATE_OF_PUBLICATION_XXXX_00_0000_DATE_OF_CURRENT_VERSION_XXXX_00_0000_Improved_Threshold_Based_and_Trainable_Fully_Automated_Segmentation_for_Breast_Cancer_Boundary_and_Pectoral_Muscle_in_Mammogram_","343106326_A_Modified_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_Model_for_Medical_Image_Segmentation","341413445_A_Comprehensive_Review_of_Dimensionality_Reduction_Techniques_for_Feature_Selection_and_Feature_Extraction","341119469_Machine_Learning_Supervised_Algorithms_of_Gene_Selection_A_Review","343921233_On_Predicting_and_Analyzing_Breast_Cancer_Using_Data_Mining_Approach","342956352_Fused_faster_RCNNs_for_efficient_detection_of_the_license_plates","342575768_Data_mining_in_the_construction_industry_Present_status_opportunities_and_future_trends","340945742_A_Comparative_Analysis_of_Breast_Cancer_Detection_and_Diagnosis_Using_Data_Visualization_and_Machine_Learning_Applications","339646247_Gene_Expression_Classification_Based_on_Deep_Learning","338793568_Comparison_of_Classification_Models_for_Early_Prediction_of_Breast_Cancer","340696874_Improved_Framework_for_Breast_Cancer_Prediction_Using_Frequent_Itemsets_Mining_for_Attributes_Filtering","339938414_A_Review_on_Data_Mining_Techniques_for_Prediction_of_Breast_Cancer_Recurrence"]}
