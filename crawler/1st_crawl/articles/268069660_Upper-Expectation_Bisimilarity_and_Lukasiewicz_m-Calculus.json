{"id":"268069660_Upper-Expectation_Bisimilarity_and_Lukasiewicz_m-Calculus","abstract":"Several notions of bisimulation relations for probabilistic nondeterministic transition systems have been considered in the literature. We study a novel testing-based behavioral equivalence called upper expectation bisimilarity and, using standard results from functional analysis, we develop its coalgebraic and algebraic theory and provide a logical characterization in terms of an expressive probabilistic modal Î¼-calculus.","authors":["Matteo Mio"],"meta":["April 2014","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-54830-7_22","Conference: International Conference on Foundations of Software Science and Computation Structures"],"references":["261367541_Axiomatizing_Bisimulation_Equivalences_and_Metrics_from_Probabilistic_SOS_Rules","225164313_A_Spectrum_of_Behavioral_Relations_over_LTSs_on_Probability_Distributions","222825551_RETRACTED_Semantic_Domains_for_Combining_Probability_and_Non-Determinism","220700962_Testing_Finitary_Probabilistic_Processes","220690719_Principles_of_Model_Checking","220370791_Semantic_Domains_for_Combining_Probability_and_Non-Determinism","51716432_Probabilistic_systems_coalgebraically_A_survey","37997154_Modeling_and_Verification_of_Randomized_Distributed_Real_-Time_Systems","29614708_On_the_Bayes_Risk_in_Information-Hiding_Protocols","1739544_Game_Refinement_Relations_and_Metrics","313241948_Probabilistic_simulations_for_probabilistic_processes","292449186_Game_semantics_for_probabilistic_modal_m-calculi","265455313_Classical_Descriptive_Set_Theory","262220404_A_Proof_System_for_Compositional_Verification_of_Probabilistic_Concurrent_Processes","256423021_Lukasiewicz_mu-Calculus","245624208_CCS-A_Calculus_for_Communicating_Systems","243768835_Logics_for_Coalgebras_and_Applications_to_Computer_Science","241864582_Advanced_Topics_in_Bisimulation_and_Coinduction","232959023_Probabilistic_Modal_m-Calculus_with_Independent_Product","232716920_Results_on_the_Propositional_mu-Calculus","226490327_Model_checking_of_probabilistic_and_nondeterministic_systems","222678929_Quantitative_Solution_of_Omega-Regular_Games","222552578_Weak_bisimulation_is_sound_and_complete_for_pCTL","221570294_Prevision_Domains_and_Convex_Powercones","220896444_Characterising_Probabilistic_Processes_Logically_Extended_Abstract","220694920_Labelled_Markov_Processes","220151709_Metrics_for_Labelled_Markov_Processes","3707382_Quantitative_analysis_and_model_checking","2870579_On_Generalised_Coinduction_and_Probabilistic_Specification_Formats_Distributive_Laws_in_Coalgebraic_Modelling","2294754_A_Probabilistic_Temporal_Calculus_Based_on_Expectations"]}
