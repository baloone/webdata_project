{"id":"347520956_Predicting_and_Analysis_of_Students'_Academic_Performance_using_Data_Mining_Techniques","abstract":"The educational database holds on the massive amount of data and\nit is increasing rapidly. Data mining provides effective techniques\nfor discovering useful knowledge and pattern from students’ data.\nThe discovered patterns can be used to understand many problems\nin the educational field. This paper proposes a framework to predict\nthe achievement of first-year bachelor’s students in computer science course. Decision Tree, Na¨ıve Bayes, and Multi-Layer Perceptron classification methods are applied to the students’ data using\nthe WEKA Data Mining tool to produce the best prediction model\nof the students’ academic performance. Experiments conducted to\ndetect the best model among the used techniques then the models’\naccuracy is computed. The extracted knowledge from the prediction model will be utilized to recognize and profile the student to\ndecide the students’ level of success in the first semester.","authors":["Reda M.
