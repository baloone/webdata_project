{"id":"224951985_Magic-State_Distillation_in_All_Prime_Dimensions_Using_Quantum_Reed-Muller_Codes","abstract":"We propose families of protocols for magic state distillation -- important\ncomponents of fault tolerance schemes --- for systems of odd prime dimension.\nOur protocols utilize quantum Reed-Muller codes with transversal non-Clifford\ngates. We find that, in higher dimensions, small and effective codes can be\nused that have no direct analogue in qubit (two-dimensional) systems. We\npresent several concrete protocols, including schemes for three-dimensional\n(qutrit) and five-dimensional (ququint) systems. The five-dimensional protocol\nis, by many measures, the best magic state distillation scheme yet discovered.\nIt excels both in terms of error threshold with respect to depolarising noise\n(36.3%) and the efficiency measure know as \"yield\", where, for a large region\nof parameters, it outperforms its qubit counterpart by many orders of\nmagnitude.","authors":["Earl Campbell","Hussain Anwar","Dan Browne"],"meta":["May 2012Physical Review X 2(4)","DOI:10.1103/PhysRevX.2.041021","SourcearXiv"],"references":["321570341_Theory_of_Quantum_Computation_Communication_and_Cryptography_4th_WorkshopTQC_2009_Waterloo_Canada_May_11-13_2009_Revised_Selected_Papers","292136813_Universal_quantum_computation_with_ideal_Clifford_gates_and_noisy_ancillas","291787199_Fault-tolerant_quantum_computation_by_anyons","265461895_Designs_and_Their_Codes","260050445_Universal_simulation_of_Hamiltonian_dynamics_for_quantum_systems_with_finite-dimensional_state_spaces","258239683_The_theory_of_error-correcting_codes_Parts_I_II","258085143_Efficient_Polar_Coding_of_Quantum_Information","245580313_Engineering_non-Abelian_topological_memories_from_Abelian_lattice_models","242795892_On_generalized_ReedMuller_codes_and_their_relatives","238677680_Quantum_universality_by_distilling_certain_one-_and_two-qubit_states_with_stabilizer_operations"]}
