{"id":"272119058_Australian_Education_Journals_Quantitative_and_Qualitative_Indicators","abstract":"This paper reports on a study that applied citationbased measurements to Australian education journals. Citations data were drawn from two sources, Web of Science and Scopus, and these data were used to calculate each journalâ€™s impact factor, h-index, and diffusion factor. The rankings resulting from these analyses were compared with draft rankings assigned to the journals by Excellence for Research in Australia (ERA). Scopus emerged as the citation source most favourable to these journals and some consistency of data across the citation-based measures was found.","authors":["Gaby Haddow","Paul Genoni"],"meta":["June 2009Australian Academic and Research Libraries 40(2):88-104","DOI:10.1080/00048623.2009.10721388"],"references":["255573661_ASSESSING_THE_IMPACT_OF_AUSTRALIAN_JOURNALS_IN_THE_SOCIAL_SCIENCES_AND_HUMANITIES","250221943_Google_Scholar_as_a_New_Source_for_Citation_Analysis","248843855_Impact_of_Data_Sources_on_Citation_Counts_and_Rankings_of_LIS_Faculty_Web_of_Science_vs","242472111_Hidden_dangers_of_a_citation_culture","313486736_Bibliometrics_to_webometrics","279918197_Citation_Analysis","271946609_A_Citation_Analysis_of_Australian_Science_and_Social_Science_Journals","253144319_ERA_and_the_Ranking_of_Australian_Humanities_Journals","242916206_Advantages_and_limitations_in_the_use_of_impact_factor_measures_for_the_assessment_of_research_performance","242578926_Escape_from_the_impact_factor"]}
