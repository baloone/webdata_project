{"id":"302984964_Ocean_Container_Transport_in_Global_Supply_Chains_Overview_and_Research_Opportunities","abstract":"This paper surveys the extant research in the field of ocean container transport. A wide range of issues is discussed including strategic planning, tactical planning and operations management issues, which are categorized into six research areas. The relationships between these research areas are discussed and the relevant literature is reviewed. Representative models are selected or modified to provide a flavour of their functions and application context, and used to explain current shipping practices. Future research opportunities bearing in mind the emerging phenomena in the field are discussed. The main purpose is to raise awareness and encourage more research into and application of operations management techniques and tools in container transport chains.","authors":["Chung-Yee Lee","Dong-Ping Song"],"meta":["May 2016Transportation Research Part B Methodological 95","DOI:10.1016/j.trb.2016.05.001"],"references":["282970517_Determinants_of_slow_steaming_and_implications_on_service_patterns","274404625_Joint_slot_allocation_and_dynamic_pricing_of_container_sea-rail_multimodal_transportation","270578489_Empty_Container_Repositioning","270286983_Container_Port_Competition_and_Competitiveness_Analysis_Asian_Major_Ports","264835884_Pricing_joint_products_in_liner_shipping","263249973_Urban_road_congestion_capacity_expansion_and_port_competition_Empirical_analysis_of_US_container_ports","262104128_Optimal_Policy_for_Inventory_Transfer_Between_Two_Depots_With_Backlogging","261975663_A_Strategic_Empty_Container_Logistics_Optimization_in_a_Major_Shipping_Company","303697880_A_Markov_decision_process_model_for_an_online_empty_container_repositioning_problem_in_a_two-port_fixed_route","303693515_Performance_evaluation_of_control_policies_for_container_fleet_management_using_simulation","303693039_Empty_container_management_in_multi-port_system_with_inventory-based_control","303692801_The_Rising_Costs_of_Piracy","291555886_Modeling_port_competition_from_a_transport_chain_perspective","291425327_The_Pirates'_Curse_Economic_Impacts_of_the_Maritime_Piracy","291424132_Pricing_and_competition_in_a_shipping_market_with_waste_shipments_and_empty_container_repositioning","286238753_The_value_of_specific_cargo_information_for_substitutable_modes_of_inland_transport","284069820_Applying_a_time-space_network_to_reposition_reefer_containers_among_major_Asian_ports","283469275_Empty_container_exchange_among_liner_carriers","279270164_Disruption_Recovery_for_a_Vessel_in_Liner_Shipping","277669185_Joint_service_capacity_planning_and_dynamic_container_routing_in_shipping_network_with_uncertain_demands","275999539_Maritime_Empty_Container_Repositioning","274460786_An_utility-based_decision_support_sustainability_model_in_slow_steaming_maritime_operations","274310533_Positioning_empty_containers_under_dependent_demand_process","273400028_Multi-objective_decision_support_to_enhance_environmental_sustainability_in_maritime_shipping_A_review_and_future_directions","273286410_Network_Design_and_Capacity_Exchange_for_Liner_Alliances_with_Fixed_and_Variable_Container_Demands","272718616_Network_Design_for_Shipping_Service_of_Large-Scale_Intermodal_Liners","271614903_Speed_models_for_energy-efficient_maritime_transportation_A_taxonomy_and_survey","271602174_Liner_services_network_design_and_fleet_deployment_with_empty_container_repositioning","270634953_Containership_Routing_and_Scheduling_in_Liner_Shipping_Overview_and_Future_Research_Directions","269730640_Profit-based_maritime_container_assignment_models_for_liner_shipping_networks","269727059_Fractional_Price_Matching_Policies_Arising_from_the_Ocean_Freight_Service_Industry","268882746_Pricing_and_balancing_of_the_sea-cargo_service_chain_with_empty_equipment_repositioning","267208209_A_matheuristic_for_the_liner_shipping_network_design_problem","267087388_Game-theoretical_models_for_competition_analysis_in_a_new_emerging_liner_container_shipping_market","263848568_Modelling_Maritime_Piracy_A_Spatial_Approach","263326697_Repositioning_empty_containers_in_East_and_North_China_ports","263326125_An_optimization_model_for_the_inland_repositioning_of_empty_containers","263249979_Container_transshipment_and_port_competition","263204145_Maritime_piracy_and_the_cost_of_world_trade","263203169_Maritime_safety_analysis_in_retrospect","263195026_Multi-period_empty_container_repositioning_with_stochastic_demand_and_lost_sales","263105513_Replenishment_policies_for_empty_containers_in_an_inland_multi-depot_system","262426393_Liner_shipping_network_design_with_deadlines","262103899_Long-haul_liner_service_route_design_with_ship_deployment_and_empty_container_repositioning","261758624_An_Analysis_of_Shipping_Agreements_The_Cooperative_Container_Network","261715335_Ship_speed_optimization_Concepts_models_and_combined_speed-routing_scenarios","261361455_Understanding_the_development_of_port_and_regional_relationships_A_new_cooperationcompetition_matrix","260736667_The_Critical_Role_of_Ocean_Container_Transport_in_Global_Supply_Chain_Performance","260251772_Liner_ship_route_schedule_design_with_port_time_windows","260111207_A_service_flow_model_for_the_liner_shipping_network_design_problem","259579038_Modeling_the_Oligopolistic_and_Competitive_Behavior_of_Carriers_in_Maritime_Freight_Transportation_Networks","259517977_An_analysis_of_safety_and_security_risks_in_container_shipping_operations_A_case_study_of_Taiwan","260110612_Methods_for_strategic_liner_shipping_network_design","259522154_Mergers_and_acquisitions_in_shipping","259522152_A_novel_hybrid-link-based_container_routing_model"]}
