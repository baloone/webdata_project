{"id":"249781493_Laboratory_Evaluation_of_Wrinkle_Recovery","abstract":"Wrinkle recovery measurements made at 65% RH provide information which may not be related to the performance of the fabric under service conditions. For some pur poses, more useful information is obtained when the specimen is creased in a high- humidity atmosphere and then allowed to recover at a lower humidity. The influence of several variables in such a test have been studied for the commonly-used \"vertical strip\" technique. A new technique is also described, using an instrument known as the FRL2 Wrinkler. Correlation between several laboratory tests and performance in service is examined. The FRL2 Wrinkler test is the only one which gave perfect correlation. Additional work is being carrier out to verify the general applicability of the method, using fibers and fabric constructions entirely different from those described in this paper.","authors":["Norman J.
