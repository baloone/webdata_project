{"id":"335472824_Soft_Inkjet_Circuits_Rapid_Multi_Material_Fabrication_of_Soft_Circuits_Using_a_Commodity_Inkjet_Printer","abstract":"Despite the increasing popularity of soft interactive devices, their fabrication remains complex and time consuming. We contribute a process for rapid do-it-yourself fabrication of soft circuits using a conventional desktop inkjet printer. It supports inkjet printing of circuits that are stretchable, ultrathin, high resolution, and integrated with a wide variety of materials used for prototyping. We introduce multi-ink functional printing on a desktop printer for realizing multi-material devices, including conductive and isolating inks. We further present DIY techniques to enhance compatibility be-tween inks and substrates and the circuits’ elasticity. This enables circuits on a wide set of materials including temporary tattoo paper, textiles, and thermoplastic. Four application cases demonstrate versatile uses for realizing stretchable devices, e-textiles, body-based and re-shapeable interfaces.","authors":["Arshad Khan","Joan Sol Roo","Tobias Kraus","Jürgen Steimle"],"meta":["October 2019","DOI:10.1145/3332165.3347892","Conference: UIST '19: Proceedings of the 32nd Annual ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and TechnologyAt: New Orleans, LA, USA"],"references":["332740700_LASEC_Instant_Fabrication_of_Stretchable_Circuits_Using_a_Laser_Cutter","327415858_Three-dimensional_integrated_stretchable_electronics","324664276_Silicone_Devices_A_Scalable_DIY_Approach_for_Fabricating_Self-Contained_Multi-Layered_Soft_Circuits_using_Microfluidics","324663849_SketchStitch_Interactive_Embroidery_for_E-textiles","324627416_Accessing_individual_75-micron_diameter_nozzles_of_a_desktop_inkjet_printer_to_dispense_picoliter_droplets_on_demand","328326649_Tacttoo_A_Thin_and_Feel-Through_Tattoo_for_On-Skin_Tactile_Output","325358046_Modified_desktop_inkjet_printer_as_low-cost_material_deposition_device","324665310_Multi-Touch_Skin_A_Thin_and_Flexible_Multi-Touch_Sensor_for_On-Skin_Input","324664846_HCI_meets_Material_Science_A_Literature_Review_of_Morphing_Materials_for_the_Design_of_Shape-Changing_Interfaces","323760784_Screenprinting_and_TEI_Supporting_Engagement_with_STEAM_through_DIY_Fabrication_of_Smart_Materials","320575455_iSoft_A_Customizable_Soft_Sensor_with_Real-time_Continuous_Contact_and_Stretching_Sensing","322681653_Large-Grain_Tin-Rich_Perovskite_Films_for_Efficient_Solar_Cells_via_Metal_Alloying_Technique","322351979_ObjectSkin_Augmenting_Everyday_Objects_with_Hydroprinted_Touch_Sensors_and_Displays","320572058_SmartSleeve_Real-time_Sensing_of_Surface_and_Deformation_Gestures_on_Flexible_Interactive_Textiles_using_a_Hybrid_Gesture_Detection_Pipeline","320291977_Inkjet-Printed_Electrodes_on_A4_Paper_Substrates_for_Low-Cost_Disposable_and_Flexible_Asymmetric_Supercapacitors"]}
