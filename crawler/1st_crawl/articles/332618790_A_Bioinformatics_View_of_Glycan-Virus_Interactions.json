{"id":"332618790_A_Bioinformatics_View_of_Glycan-Virus_Interactions","abstract":"Evidence of the mediation of glycan molecules in the interaction between viruses and their hosts is accumulating and is now partially reflected in several online databases. Bioinformatics provides convenient and efficient means of searching, visualizing, comparing, and sometimes predicting, interactions in numerous and diverse molecular biology applications related to the -omics fields. As viromics is gaining momentum, bioinformatics support is increasingly needed. We propose a survey of the current resources for searching, visualizing, comparing, and possibly predicting host–virus interactions that integrate the presence and role of glycans. To the best of our knowledge, we have mapped the specialized and general-purpose databases with the appropriate focus. With an illustration of their potential usage, we also discuss the strong and weak points of the current bioinformatics landscape in the context of understanding viral infection and the immune response to it.","authors":["Le Mercier","Julien Mariethoz","Josefina Lascano Maillard","François Bonnardel"],"meta":["April 2019Viruses 11(4):374","DOI:10.3390/v11040374"],"references":["334453867_GlycanFormatConverter_A_conversion_tool_for_translating_the_complexities_of_glycans","328612349_MatrixDB_integration_of_new_data_with_a_focus_on_glycosaminoglycan_interactions","328603195_Protein_Data_Bank_the_single_global_archive_for_3D_macromolecular_structure_data","328492627_The_Immune_Epitope_Database_IEDB_2018_update","327729039_UniLectin3D_a_database_of_carbohydrate_binding_proteins_with_curated_information_on_3D_structures_and_interacting_ligands","331429641_GLAD_GLycan_Array_Dashboard_a_Visual_Analytics_Tool_for_Glycan_Microarrays","329843741_GlyConnect_Glycoproteomics_Goes_Visual_Interactive_and_Analytical","328612348_PubChem_2019_update_improved_access_to_chemical_data","327822690_A_pipeline_to_translate_glycosaminoglycan_sequences_into_3D_models_Application_to_the_exploration_of_glycosaminoglycan_conformational_space","327512245_Exploring_the_Uncharacterized_Human_Proteome_Using_neXtProt"]}
