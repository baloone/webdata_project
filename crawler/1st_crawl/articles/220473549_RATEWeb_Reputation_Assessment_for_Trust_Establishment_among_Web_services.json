{"id":"220473549_RATEWeb_Reputation_Assessment_for_Trust_Establishment_among_Web_services","abstract":"We introduce RATEWeb, a framework for establishing trust in service-oriented environments. RATEWeb supports a cooperative\nmodel in which Web services share their experiences of the service providers with their peers through feedback ratings. The\ndifferent ratings are aggregated to derive a service providerâ€™s reputation. This in turn is used to evaluate trust. The overall\ngoal of RATEWeb is to facilitate trust-based selection and composition of Web services. We propose a set of decentralized\ntechniques that aim at accurately aggregating the submitted ratings for reputation assessment. We conduct experiments to assess\nthe fairness and accuracy of the proposed techniques.","authors":["Zaki Malik","Athman Bouguettaya"],"meta":["August 2009The VLDB Journal 18(4):885-911","DOI:10.1007/s00778-009-0138-1","SourceDBLP"],"references":["245725748_Memory-Based_Weighted-Majority_Prediction_for_Recommender_Systems","314830359_Pride_peer-to-peer_reputation_infrastructure_for_decentralized_environments","314824057_An_incentive_compatible_reputation_mechanism","314801274_Managing_trust_in_a_peer-2-peer_information_system","313550669_Serive-oriented_computing","307631671_The_pagerank_citation_ranking_Bringing_order_to_the_web","288938096_QoS-based_service_selection_and_ranking_with_trust_and_reputation_management","260357584_PowerTrust_A_Robust_and_Scalable_Reputation_System_for_Trusted_Peer-to-Peer_Computing","243773883_The_Semantic_Web_in_Scientific_American","239060789_Understanding_quality_of_service_for_Web_services"]}
