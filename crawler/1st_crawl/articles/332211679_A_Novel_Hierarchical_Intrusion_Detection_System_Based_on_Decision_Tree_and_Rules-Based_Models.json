{"id":"332211679_A_Novel_Hierarchical_Intrusion_Detection_System_Based_on_Decision_Tree_and_Rules-Based_Models","abstract":"This paper proposes a novel intrusion detection system (IDS) that combines different classifier approaches which are based on decision tree and rules-based concepts, namely, REP Tree, JRip algorithm and Forest PA. Specifically, the first and second method take as inputs features of the data set, and classify the network traffic as Attack/Benign. The third classifier uses features of the initial data set in addition to the outputs of the first and the second classifier as inputs. The experimental results obtained by analyzing the proposed IDS using the CICIDS2017 dataset, attest their superiority in terms of accuracy, detection rate, false alarm rate and time overhead as compared to state of the art existing schemes.","authors":["Ahmed Ahmim","Leandros Maglaras","Mohamed Amine Ferrag","Makhlouf Derdour"],"meta":["May 2019","DOI:10.1109/DCOSS.2019.00059","Conference: 1st International Workshop on Security and Reliability of IoT Systems - SecRlot 2019At: Greece","Projects: IoT and Microservices Architectural Framework : Smart Usage Contexts and AdaptationSecurity and Privacy of Industrial Control Systems"],"references":["327073518_A_survey_of_intrusion_detection_on_industrial_control_systems","322909940_Cyber_Security_of_Critical_Infrastructures","318814623_Forest_PA_Constructing_a_Decision_Forest_by_Penalizing_Attributes_used_in_Previous_Trees","315642556_Anomaly-based_intrusion_detection_system_through_feature_selection_analysis_and_building_hybrid_efficient_model","327007150_An_experimental_evaluation_of_weightless_neural_networks_for_multi-class_classification","323358102_An_intrusion_detection_system_based_on_combining_probability_predictions_of_a_tree_of_classifiers","315863684_An_Evaluation_Framework_for_Intrusion_Detection_Dataset","311450485_Fast_effective_rule_induction","308912334_Multi-level_hybrid_support_vector_machine_and_extreme_learning_machine_based_on_modified_K-means_for_intrusion_detection_system","307881957_LIBSVM_A_library_for_support_vector_machines"]}
