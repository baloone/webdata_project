{"id":"339533419_Impact_of_the_Sub-Resting_Membrane_Potential_on_Accurate_Inference_in_Spiking_Neural_Networks","abstract":"Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are considered as the third generation of artificial neural networks, having the potential to improve the energy efficiency of conventional computing systems. Although the firing rate of a spiking neuron is an approximation of rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation in an analog-valued neural network (ANN), there remain many challenges to be overcome owing to differences in operation between ANNs and SNNs. Unlike actual biological and biophysical processes, various hardware implementations of neurons and SNNs do not allow the membrane potential to fall below the resting potentialâ€”in other words, neurons must allow the sub-resting membrane potential. Because there occur an excitatory post-synaptic potential (EPSP) as well as an inhibitory post-synaptic potential (IPSP), negatively valued synaptic weights in SNNs induce the sub-resting membrane potential at some time point. If a membrane is not allowed to hold the sub-resting potential, errors will accumulate over time, resulting in inaccurate inference operations. This phenomenon is not observed in ANNs given their use of only spatial synaptic integration, but it can cause serious performance degradation in SNNs. In this paper, we demonstrate the impact of the sub-resting membrane potential on accurate inference operations in SNNs. Moreover, several important considerations for a hardware SNN that can maintain the sub-resting membrane potential are discussed. All of the results in this paper indicate that it is essential for neurons to allow the sub-resting membrane potential in order to realize high-performance SNNs.","authors":["Sungmin Hwang","Jeesoo Chang","Min-Hye Oh","J.
