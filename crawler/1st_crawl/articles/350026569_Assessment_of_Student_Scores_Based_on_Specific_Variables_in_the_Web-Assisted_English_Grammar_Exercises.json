{"id":"350026569_Assessment_of_Student_Scores_Based_on_Specific_Variables_in_the_Web-Assisted_English_Grammar_Exercises","abstract":"The general purpose of this study is to assess English language grammar post scores of the learners when they have done web supported exercises; the assessment has been done according to gender, attending English courses, out-of-school learning of English language and the use of other sources other than English textbooks. In order to achieve this aim, the research was carried out with a control and experimental group. Experimental and control groups were formed according to the neutrality rule by equalizing certain variables. In the study, \"English Grammar Test\" ”and “personal data collection tool”, which are valid and reliable, were used as data collection tools. The experimental group followed the English exercise in a web-supported English learning environment. The data were analysed using statistical techniques. At the end of the study, there was a significant difference in favour of women among the subjects in the experimental group, while no significant differences in other factors were observed between the experimental and control groups. As the most important suggestion, mixed or separate learning environments related to and supporting grammar for speaking, writing, listening and reading skills should be developed or explored while learning English or other languages for learners in social media. Keywords: Web-assisted Learning, English Language Learning, Grammar, gender, social media, out-of-school learning.","authors":["Huseyin Uzunboylu"],"meta":["July 2019World Journal on Educational Technology Current Issues 11(3):205-219","DOI:10.18844/wjet.v11i3.4262"],"references":["332912903_The_economic_benefits_of_cloud-based_E-commerce_in_Indian_service_small_to_medium_businesses_SMBs","330191167_Investigating_the_Relationship_Between_Task_Complexity_Cognitive_Ability_and_Disorientation_in_Hypertext_Navigation","322554754_Examining_the_relationship_between_pre-service_teachers'_educational_technology_and_material_development_competency_and_their_techno-pedagogical_competency","308967803_Examination_of_studies_on_technology-assisted_collaborative_learning_published_between_2010-2014","280836529_Categorization_of_text_chat_communication_between_learners_and_native_speakers_of_Japanese_Electronic_version","334583631_The_reflection_of_organisational_culture_on_technology_usage_in_secondary_education_classes","333734289_The_investigation_of_mood_and_modality_in_the_first_letter_of_nahj_elblahgheh_based_on_Halliday's_systemic_functional_grammar","321486339_Designing_blended_learning_environments_organized_within_the_basis_of_web-assisted_modeling_in_science_teaching","320953338_Conceptual_analysis_studies_in_Turkish_tests_and_suggestions_to_solve_the_computer_network_terms_lexicon","316772148_The_impact_of_computer-assisted_language_learning_on_Iranian_EFL_students'_vocabulary_learning","246490310_Integrating_Web-Based_Learning_activities_into_School_Curriculums","226626484_Instructional_utilization_of_the_internet_in_public_school_settings"]}
