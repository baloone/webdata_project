{"id":"318353958_Using_Physics_Inspired_Wave_Agents_in_a_Virtual_Environment_Longitudinal_Distance_Control_in_Robots_Platoon","abstract":"The monitoring and the surveillance of industrial and agricultural sites have become first order tasks mainly for security or the safety reasons. The main issues of this activity is tied to the size of the sites and to their accessibility. Thus, it seems nowadays relevant to tackle with this problem with robots, which can detect potential issues with a low operational cost. To that purpose, in addition to individual patrolling behavior, robots need coordination schemes. The goal of this paper is to explore the possibility of using interference fringes and waves properties in a virtual environment to tackle with the longitudinal distance regulation in the platoon control issue. The proposed model, based on a multi-agent paradigm, is considering each vehicle as an agent wave generator in the virtual environment.","authors":["Baudouin Dafflon","Maxime Gu√©riau","Franck Gechter"],"meta":["April 2017The International Journal of Monitoring and Surveillance Technologies Research (IJMSTR) 5(2):15-28","DOI:10.4018/IJMSTR.2017040102"],"references":["311589277_WAVE_Wave_Agents_in_a_Virtual_Environment_-_A_Proof_of_Concept_Applied_to_Longitudinal_Distance_Regulation_in_Platoon_Control","289701937_Cyber-physical_systems_-_Concept_challenges_and_research_areas","277604582_Adaptive_Autonomous_Navigation_using_Reactive_Multi-agent_System_for_Control_Law_Merging","309307152_A_social_spider_optimization_approach_for_clustering_text_documents","308873090_Ant_Colony_Algorithm_Research_Based_on_Pheromone_Update_Strategy","307622559_An_interaction_model_for_a_local_approach_to_vehicle_platoons","306260783_Reconstruction_of_Battery_Level_Curves_Based_on_User_Data_Collected_from_a_Smartphone","300638826_Towards_a_Theory_for_Bio_-_-_Cyber_Physical_Systems_Modelling","284139268_A_Cyber-Physical_model_for_platoon_system","261415993_Using_monocular_visual_SLAM_to_manually_convoy_a_fleet_of_automatic_urban_vehicles"]}
