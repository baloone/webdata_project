{"id":"257138572_Design_Implementation_of_Smart_House_Control_Using_LabVIEW","abstract":"Smart home is a house that uses information technology to monitor the environment, control the electric appliance and communicates with the outer world. Smart home is a complex technology, at the same time it is developing. A smart home automation system has been developed to automatically achieve some activities performed frequently in daily life to obtain more comfortable and easier life environment. A sample house environment monitor and control system that is one branch of the Smart home is addressed in this paper. The system is based on the LabVIEW software and can act as a security guard of the home. The system can monitor the temperature, humidity, lighting, fire & burglar alarm, gas density of the house and have infrared sensor to guarantees the family security. The system also has internet connection to monitor and control the house equipmentâ€™s from anywhere in the world. This paper presents the hardware implementation of a multiplatform control system for house automation using LabVIEW. Such a system belongs to a domain usually named smart house systems. The approach combines hardware and software technologies. Test results of the system have shown that it can be easily used for the smart home automation applications.","authors":["Basil Hamed"],"meta":["January 2012"],"references":["224398839_ISS_The_Interactive_Smart_home_Simulator","4318475_Towards_a_Home_Application_Server","329162844_LabVIEW_Advanced_programming_techniques","238191918_National_Instruments_LabVIEW_A_Programming_Environment_for_Laboratory_Automation_and_Measurement","232654315_Integration_of_wireless_Fieldbus_and_wired_Fieldbus_for_health_monitoring_PDF","224573804_Smart_House_monitoring_and_actuating_system_development_using_automatic_code_generation","221507979_Architectures_for_ubiquitous_environments"]}
