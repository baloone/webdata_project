{"id":"312880972_Optimal-Time_Adaptive_Strong_Renaming_with_Applications_to_Counting","abstract":"We give two new randomized algorithms for tight renaming, both of which work against an adaptive adversary. The first uses repeated sampling over a sequence of arrays of decreasing size to assign unique names to each of $n$ processes with step complexity $O(\\log^3 n)$. The second transforms any sorting network into a tight adaptive renaming protocol, with an expected cost equal to the depth of the sorting network. Using an AKS sorting network, this gives a tight adaptive renaming algorithm with step complexity $O(\\log k)$, where $k$ is the contention in the current execution. We show this to be optimal based on a classic lower bound of Jayanti. We also show that any such tight renaming protocol can be used to build a monotone-consistent counter with logarithmic step complexity (at the cost of adding a max register) or a linearizable fetch-and-increment register (at the cost of increasing the step complexity by a logarithmic factor).","authors":["Dan Alistarh","James Aspnes","Keren Censor-Hillel","Seth Gilbert"],"meta":["January 2011"],"references":["234819920_Shavit_N_The_Topological_Structure_of_Asynchronous_Computability_Journal_of_the_ACM_466_858-923","227311486_Fully-Adaptive_Algorithms_for_Long-Lived_Renaming","225789871_Fast_long-lived_renaming_improved_and_simplified","225711833_Randomized_Two-Process_Wait-Free_Test-and-Set","221590321_An_On_log_n_Sorting_Network","221343913_Fast_Long-Lived_Renaming_Improved_and_Simplified_Abstract","221233823_Fast_Randomized_Test-and-Set_and_Renaming","221233720_Wait-free_Test-and-Set_Extended_Abstract","220566884_Efficient_adaptive_collect_using_randomization","47842800_Randomized_Naming_Using_Wait-Free_Shared_Variables","2809191_Counting_Networks","2728868_Using_Local-Spin_k-Exclusion_Algorithms_to_Improve_Wait-Free_Object_Implementations","312944514_Fast_Randomized_Test-and-Set_and_Renaming","262493823_The_Art_of_Computer_Programming","234816293_Immediate_atomic_snapshots_and_fast_renaming","234801798_Ambiguity_of_choosing","222299981_From_adaptive_renaming_to_set_agreement","221669789_Probability_and_Computing_Randomized_Algorithms_and_Probabilistic_Analysis","221344306_Asynchronous_Exclusive_Selection","221343909_Immediate_Atomic_Snapshots_and_Fast_Renaming_Extended_Abstract","221343906_Max_Registers_Counters_and_Monotone_Circuits_Preliminary_Version","221343462_New_Combinatorial_Topology_Upper_and_Lower_Bounds_for_Renaming","221234107_Long-Lived_Fast_Waitfree_Renaming_with_Optimal_Name_Space_and_High_Throughput","221233821_Fast_Long-Lived_Renaming_Extended_Abstract","221233717_Efficient_Atomic_Snapshots_Using_Lattice_Agreement_Extended_Abstract","220432418_Tight_bounds_for_asynchronous_randomized_consensus","220431501_Renaming_in_an_Asynchronous_Environment","2434268_Adaptive_And_Efficient_Algorithms_For_Lattice_Agreement_And_Renaming","2296624_A_Time_Complexity_Lower_Bound_for_Randomized_Implementations_of_Some_Shared_Objects"]}
