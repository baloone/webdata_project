{"id":"311625097_Printing_soft_matter_in_three_dimensions","abstract":"Light- and ink-based three-dimensional (3D) printing methods allow the rapid design and fabrication of materials without the need for expensive tooling, dies or lithographic masks. They have led to an era of manufacturing in which computers can control the fabrication of soft matter that has tunable mechanical, electrical and other functional properties. The expanding range of printable materials, coupled with the ability to programmably control their composition and architecture across various length scales, is driving innovation in myriad applications. This is illustrated by examples of biologically inspired composites, shape-morphing systems, soft sensors and robotics that only additive manufacturing can produce.","authors":["Ryan Truby","Jennifer Lewis"],"meta":["December 2016Nature 540(7633):371-378","DOI:10.1038/nature21003"],"references":["303885913_Printable_hydraulics_A_method_for_fabricating_robots_by_3D_co-printing_solids_and_liquids","301644733_3D_Printed_Reversible_Shape_Changing_Components_with_Stimuli_Responsive_Materials","297896323_Three-dimensional_printing_of_continuous-fiber_composites_by_in-nozzle_impregnation","292977885_Open-Source_Selective_Laser_Sintering_OpenSLS_of_Nylon_and_Biocompatible_Polycaprolactone","284924695_Materials_by_design_Using_architecture_in_material_design_to_reach_new_property_spaces","283209388_Designing_bioinspired_composite_reinforcement_architectures_via_3D_magnetic_printing","283208170_Multimaterial_magnetically_assisted_3D_printing_of_composite_materials","282268744_Writing_in_the_granular_gel_medium","281623186_Sequential_Self-Folding_Structures_by_3D_Printed_Digital_Shape_Memory_Polymers","281517485_Resilient_3D_hierarchical_architected_metamaterials","279966581_SOFT_ROBOTICS_A_3D-printed_functionally_graded_soft_robot_powered_by_combustion","279303966_Printable_elastic_conductors_with_a_high_conductivity_for_electronic_textile_applications","277780093_3D_Printed_Programmable_Release_Capsules","277410991_Design_fabrication_and_control_of_soft_robots","275668047_Mitigation_of_Tracheobronchomalacia_with_3D-Printed_Personalized_Medical_Devices_in_Pediatric_Patients","269769804_Active_Printed_Materials_for_Complex_Self-_Evolving_Deformations","267746190_3D_Printed_Quantum_Dot_Light-Emitting_Diodes","265205466_The_intellectual_property_implications_of_low-cost_3D_printing","264500820_3D_Bioprinting_of_Tissues_and_Organs","263280586_Ultralight_Ultrastiff_Mechanical_Metamaterials","263166120_3D_Printing_Embedded_3D_Printing_of_Strain_Sensors_within_Highly_Stretchable_Elastomers_Adv_Mater_362014","311683058_Bioinspired_structural_materials","308098324_An_integrated_design_and_fabrication_strategy_for_entirely_soft_autonomous_robots","304537219_Two-photon_direct_laser_writing_of_ultracompact_multi-lens_objectives","301895474_Tailored_Buckling_Microlattices_as_Reusable_Light-Weight_Shock_Absorbers","301791992_Three-Dimensional_Printing_of_Multifunctional_Nanocomposites_Manufacturing_Techniques_and_Applications","301772853_3D_Printed_Bionic_Nanodevices","295688482_Recent_Progress_in_Materials_and_Devices_toward_Printable_and_Flexible_Sensors","293798194_Deterministically_patterned_biomimetic_human_iPSC-derived_hepatic_model_via_rapid_3D_bioprinting","291945919_Biomimetic_4D_printing","287619745_Topology_optimization_for_additive_manufacturing","282408649_Integrated_soft_sensors_and_elastomeric_actuators_for_tactile_machines_with_kinesthetic_sense","282130854_Active_mixing_of_complex_fluids_at_the_microscale","281683384_Fast_nastic_motion_of_plants_and_bio-inspired_structures","281634261_3D_printing_antagonistic_systems_of_artificial_muscle_using_projection_stereolithography","281171001_Topology_Optimized_Architectures_with_Programmable_Poisson's_Ratio_over_Large_Deformations","279840375_OpenFab_A_programmable_pipeline_for_multi-material_fabrication","278789457_Multistable_Architected_Materials_for_Trapping_Elastic_Strain_Energy","275048894_3D_Printing_Microfluidic_Printheads_for_Multimaterial_3D_Printing_of_Viscoelastic_Inks_Adv_Mater_212015","273955728_Additive_manufacturing_Continuous_liquid_interface_production_of_3D_objects","273385872_Capacitive_Soft_Strain_Sensors_via_Multicore-Shell_Fiber_Printing","267730311_Bioinspired_structural_materials","265734919_Three-Dimensional_Printing_of_Complex_Structures_Man_Made_or_toward_Nature","264724780_Direct_Writing_of_Gallium-Indium_Alloy_for_Stretchable_Electronics","264709874_Active_origami_by_4D_printing","264630094_APPLIED_ORIGAMI_A_method_for_building_self-folding_machines","264520270_Highly_Sensitive_Skin-Mountable_Strain_Gauges_Based_Entirely_on_Elastomers","263321824_3D-Printing_of_Lightweight_Cellular_Composites","263191796_Elastic_materials_producing_compliant_robots","262026519_Three-Dimensional_Printing_of_Elastomeric_Cellular_Architectures_with_Negative_Stiffness","260581344_A_Soft_Strain_Sensor_Based_on_Ionic_and_Metal_Liquids","261674732_Processing_parameters_investigation_for_the_fabrication_of_self-supported_and_freeform_polymeric_microstructures_using_ultraviolet-assisted_three-dimensional_printing","261538410_Tough_Composites_Inspired_by_Mineralized_Natural_Materials_Computation_3D_printing_and_Testing","260697199_Active_materials_by_four-dimension_printing","260694805_Soft_Condensed_Matter"]}
