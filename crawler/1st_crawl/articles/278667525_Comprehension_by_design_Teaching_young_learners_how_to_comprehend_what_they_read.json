{"id":"278667525_Comprehension_by_design_Teaching_young_learners_how_to_comprehend_what_they_read","abstract":"Teaching learners how to comprehend text remains a largely unsuccessful attempt in our school system. Drawing from the fields of learning sciences, education, instructional design, and performance improvement, we designed, tested, revised, and released to schools and homes an interactive online program that reliably teaches flexible, widely applicable reading comprehension strategies to children. This article describes the analysis and design processes involved in the development of such a program.","authors":["Marta Leon","Victoria Ford","Hirofumi Shimizu","April Heimlich Stretz"],"meta":["April 2011Performance Improvement 50(4):40-47","DOI:10.1002/pfi.20212"],"references":["284960442_Selected_for_success_How_Headsprout_Reading_Basics_teaches_beginning_reading","275724807_Thinking_Through_Text_Comprehension_I_Foundation_and_Guiding_Relations","275724713_Thinking_through_text_comprehension_II_Analysis_of_verbal_and_investigative_repertoires","275724290_Thinking_Through_Text_Comprehension_III_The_Programing_of_Verbal_and_Investigative_Repertoires","265265912_A_Non-Linear_Approach_to_Curriculum_Design_The_Role_of_Behavior_Analysis_in_Building_an_Effective_Reading_Program_1","253974022_Headsprout_Early_Reading_Reliably_Teaching_Children_to_Read_1","238123171_The_Effects_of_Long-Term_Vocabulary_Instruction_on_Reading_Comprehension_A_Replication","237643975_Scientific_Formative_Evaluation_The_Role_of_Individual_Learners_in_Generating_and_Predicting_Successful_Educational_Outcomes","21673728_Breaking_the_structuralist_barrier_Literacy_and_numeracy_with_fluency","284511995_Programed_Instruction_Sixty-Sixth_Yearbook_of_the_National_Society_for_the_Study_of_Education_Part_II","240886604_Designs_for_instructional_designers","234757599_Programed_Instruction_the_Sixty-Sixth_Yearbook_of_the_National_Society_for_the_Study_of_Education_Part_II","228623184_Relationships_Between_Word_Knowledge_and_Reading_Comprehension_in_Third-Grade_Children"]}
