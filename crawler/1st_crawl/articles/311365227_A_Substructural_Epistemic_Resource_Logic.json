{"id":"311365227_A_Substructural_Epistemic_Resource_Logic","abstract":"We present a substructural epistemic logic, based on Boolean BI, in which the epistemic modalities are parametrized on agents’ local resources. The new modalities can be seen as generalizations of the usual epistemic modalities. The logic combines Boolean BI’s resource semantics with epistemic agency. We give a labelled tableaux calculus and establish soundness and completeness with respect to the resource semantics. We illustrate the use of the logic by discussing an example of side-channels in access control using resource tokens.","authors":["Didier Galmiche","Pierre Kimmel","David Pym"],"meta":["December 2017Lecture Notes in Computer Science","DOI:10.1007/978-3-662-54069-5_9","Conference: Indian Conference on Logic and Its Applications"],"references":["302059548_A_Logic_of_Separating_Modalities","271530365_Budget-Constrained_Knowledge_in_Multiagent_Systems","50218118_A_Spatial-Epistemic_Logic_for_Reasoning_about_Security_Protocols","2130166_Epistemic_Actions_as_Resources","307720029_An_Epistemic_Separation_Logic","303913048_Intuitionistic_Layered_Graph_Logic","298809434_A_calculus_and_logic_of_bunched_resources_and_processes","281425897_Layered_graph_logic_as_an_assertion_language_for_access_control_policy_models","281390706_A_Modal_Separation_Logic_for_Resource_Dynamics","275166094_The_formal_strong_completeness_of_partial_monoidal_Boolean_BI","270752720_Erratum_to_A_substructural_logic_for_layered_graphs","267170210_A_discipline_of_mathematical_systems_modelling","236627477_Knowledge_and_Security","228668072_The_Semantics_of_BI_and_Resource_Tableaux","38373144_The_Logic_of_Bunched_Implications","3965916_Separation_logic_A_logic_for_shared_mutable_data_structures","2895661_BI_as_an_Assertion_Language_for_Mutable_Data_Structures","2558732_Possible_Worlds_and_Resources_The_Semantics_of_BI"]}
