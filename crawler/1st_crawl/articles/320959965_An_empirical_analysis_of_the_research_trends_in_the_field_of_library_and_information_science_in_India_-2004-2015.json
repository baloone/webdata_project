{"id":"320959965_An_empirical_analysis_of_the_research_trends_in_the_field_of_library_and_information_science_in_India_-2004-2015","abstract":"The current study aims to understand the trends in Library and Information Science (LIS) research during 2004-2015 by studying the published literature in Indian LIS journals. The research sample consists of 3713 journal articles published in 14 Indian LIS journals. An attempt is made to identify research trends through co-occurrence analysis, keyword frequency analysis and burst detection method. The study results reveal that ‘Bibliometric / Scientometric’ had been one of the most popular topics in Indian LIS research. The results also indicate an upward growth in publishing of Information Technology oriented topics like Digital Library, Electronic Resources, and Electronic Journals. In addition to the above subjects, research areas like Information Needs and Seeking, Librarianship, Public Library, Academic Library, Knowledge Management were also found to be in vogue. The burst detection technique was adopted to identify the popular themes in Indian LIS research at various points of time.","authors":["Mallikarjun Dora","H A Kumar"],"meta":["November 2017Collnet Journal of Scientometrics and Information Management 11(2):1-18","DOI:10.1080/09737766.2017.1317959"],"references":["284798151_Intellectual_structure_in_stem_cell_research_exploring_Brazilian_scientific_articles_from_2001_to_2010","283184163_Research_trends_of_library_management_in_LIS_in_India_since_1950-2012","282148794_Bibliometric_analysis_of_fracking_scientific_literature","266602190_Growth_and_visibility_of_LIS_journals_An_analytical_study","260715062_Fifty_Years_of_LIS_Research_in_India_Trends_and_Developments","257663078_Analysis_of_publication_patterns_in_Korean_library_and_information_science_research","241654338_The_state_of_iSchools_An_analysis_of_academic_research_and_graduate_education","222921934_Words_and_Co-Words_as_Indicators_of_Intellectual_Organization","220364939_Mixed-indicators_model_for_identfying_emerging_research_areas","220364655_Mapping_research_topics_using_word-reference_co-occurrences_A_method_and_an_exploratory_case_study","282415769_A_quantitative_examination_of_the_intellectual_profile_and_evolution_of_information_security_from_1965_to_2015","281737922_Information_technology_management_domain_emerging_themes_and_keyword_analysis","278710539_Measuring_Scholarly_Impact","275626125_Doctoral_Research_in_Library_and_Information_Science_in_India_Trends_and_Issues","270618817_Analysis_of_the_interdisciplinary_nature_of_library_and_information_science","266586433_Library_and_information_science_research_trends_in_India","259494779_Scientific_knowledge_dynamics_and_relatedness_in_biotech_cities","257663408_A_co-word_analysis_of_library_and_information_science_in_China","257662869_Discovering_and_analyzing_the_intellectual_structure_and_its_evolution_of_LIS_in_China_1998-2007","248662244_Content_analysis_of_research_articles_in_library_and_information_science","228848194_Library_and_information_science_education_in_India_Issues_and_trends","227733078_A_bibliometric_chronicling_of_Library_and_Information_Science's_first_hundred_years","227728571_The_Cognitive_Structure_of_Library_and_Information_Science_Analysis_of_Article_Title_Words","222564846_A_unified_approach_to_mapping_and_clustering_of_bibliometric_networks","222513668_Bibliometric_Cartography_of_Information_Retrieval_Research_by_Using_Co-Word_Analysis","222430778_Towards_mapping_library_and_information_science","220435647_A_Study_of_the_Evolution_of_Interdisciplinarity_in_Library_and_Information_Science_Using_Three_Bibliometric_Methods","50888022_LIBRARY_AND_INFORMATION_SCIENCE_RESEARCH_IN_INDIA","44807074_Software_survey_VOSviewer_a_computer_program_for_bibliometric_mapping"]}
