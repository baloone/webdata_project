{"id":"51978612_Coarse-graining_renormalization_by_higher-order_singular_value_decomposition","abstract":"We propose a novel coarse graining tensor renormalization group method based\non the higher-order singular value decomposition. This method provides an\naccurate but low computational cost technique for studying both classical and\nquantum lattice models in two- or three-dimensions. We have demonstrated this\nmethod using the Ising model on the square and cubic lattices. By keeping up to\n16 bond basis states, we obtain by far the most accurate numerical\nrenormalization group results for the 3D Ising model. We have also applied the\nmethod to study the ground state as well as finite temperature properties for\nthe two-dimensional quantum transverse Ising model and obtain the results which\nare consistent with published data.","authors":["Z.Y.
