{"id":"322372758_A_Suite_of_Object_Oriented_Cognitive_Complexity_Metrics","abstract":"Object orientation has gained a wide adoption in the software development community. To this end, different metrics that can be utilized in measuring and improving the quality of object-oriented software have been proposed, by providing insight into the maintainability and reliability of the system. Some of these software metrics are based on cognitive weight and are referred to as cognitive complexity metrics. It is our objective in this paper to present a suite of cognitive complexity metrics that can be used to evaluate object-oriented (OO) software projects. The present suite of metrics includes method complexity, message complexity, attribute complexity, weighted class complexity and code complexity. The metrics suite was evaluated theoretically using measurement theory and Weyuker’s properties, practically using Kaner’s framework and empirically using thirty projects.","authors":["Sanjay Misra","Adewole Adewumi","Luis Fernandez-Sanz","Robertas Damasevicius"],"meta":["January 2018IEEE Access 6:8782 - 8796","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2791344","Project: Software Quality Assurances through Software Metrics"],"references":["289638932_Estimating_complexity_of_programs_in_python_language","267027225_Assessing_Cognitive_Complexity_in_Java-based_Object-oriented_Systems_Metrics_and_Tool_Support","321596750_Software_Process_Improvement_Metrics_Measurement_and_Process_Modelling_Software_Best_Practice_4","320634107_Design_and_Analysis_of_Aspect_Oriented_Metric_CWCoAR_Using_Cognitive_Approach","319637586_Defining_and_Validating_a_Client-Based_Cohesion_Metric_for_Object-Oriented_Classes","313311849_An_Evaluation_of_the_MOOD_Set_of_Object-oriented_Software_Metrics","305296096_Towards_a_Metrics_Suite_for_Object_Oriented_Design","303515318_A_metric_suite_proposal_for_logical_dependency","288215550_A_new_cognitive_approach_to_measure_the_complexity_of_software's","262204654_Cem_Kaner_on_rethinking_software_metrics"]}
