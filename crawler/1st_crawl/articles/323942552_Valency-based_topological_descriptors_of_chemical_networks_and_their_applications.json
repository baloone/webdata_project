{"id":"323942552_Valency-based_topological_descriptors_of_chemical_networks_and_their_applications","abstract":"A topological descriptor/index (or molecular structure descriptor) is a numerical value associated with chemical constitution for correlation of chemical structure/network with various physical properties, chemical reactivity or biological activity. Quantitative structure-activity and structure-property relationships of chemical networks require expressions for the topological properties of these networks. Topological indices provide those expressions of topological properties. Valency-based topological descriptors are the oldest and most successful class of descriptors so far. A chemical graph/network is a representation of the structural formula of a chemical compound whose vertices correspond to the atoms of the compound and edges correspond to chemical bonds. In this paper, we study valency-based topological indices of chemical networks. By using some real world data, we performed certain comparative testings to investigate the performance of almost all well-known valency-based indices. Dependence on the molecular structure is studied for topological indices which are best in performance. We calculated explicit formulas for well-performed indices of some infinite families of carbon nanotubes, carbon nanocones and a newly proposed family of organic networks called tetrahedral diamond networks. Tetrahedral diamond networks arises by recurrently joining graphene layers in a diamond cluster. Significance and applicability of the obtained results are reported.","authors":["Sakander Hayat","Shaohui Wang","Jia-Bao Liu"],"meta":["March 2018Applied Mathematical Modelling 60","DOI:10.1016/j.apm.2018.03.016"],"references":["315642509_On_topological_properties_of_sierpinski_networks_250","312324541_On_the_Edges_Version_of_Atom-Bond_Connectivity_and_Geometric_Arithmetic_Indices_of_Nanocones_CNCkn_182","303635002_Vertex_cut_method_for_degree_and_distance-based_topological_indices_and_its_applications_to_silicate_networks","289782360_On_topological_properties_of_nanocones_CNCkn","277920539_On_topological_indices_of_carbon_nanotube_network","267390975_Computation_of_Certain_Topological_Indices_of_Nanotubes","262490136_Computation_of_topological_indices_of_certain_networks","256984527_Some_connectivity_indices_and_zagreb_index_of_polyhex_nanotubes_11","243974466_Minimum_general_sum-connectivity_index_of_unicyclic_graphs","227039013_On_geometric-arithmetic_index","225727230_On_a_novel_connectivity_index","328802158_On_molecular_topological_properties_of_hex-derived_networks","320089137_Computing_distance-based_topological_descriptors_of_complex_chemical_networks_New_theoretical_techniques","312080236_Extended_energy_and_its_dependence_on_molecular_structure","294112436_On_Zagreb_indices_Zagreb_polynomials_of_some_nanostar_dendrimers","286757122_On_atom_bond_connectivity_and_GA_indices_of_nanocones","286374858_The_Extremal_Values_of_Connective_Eccentricity_Index_for_Trees_and_Unicyclic_Graphs","281993886_An_atom-bond_connectivity_index_Modelling_the_enthalpy_of_formation_of_alkanes","281582662_Computing_Ga_index_for_some_nanotubes","272898426_Degree-Based_Topological_Indices","269729795_On_topological_indices_of_fullerenes","267057070_Mathematical_Aspects_of_Randic-Type_Molecular_Structure_Descriptors","265990429_Bounds_on_Augmented_Zagreb_Index","265383803_On_topological_indices_of_certain_interconnection_networks","257591358_Augmented_Zagreb_index","246775503_Mathatical_Concepts_in_Organic_Chemistry","244137049_Atom-bond_connectivity_and_the_energetic_of_branched_alkanes","235708091_Omega_Polynomial_in_Diamond-like_Networks","231473566_On_Characterization_of_Molecular_Branching","226275480_Topological_index_based_on_the_ratios_of_geometrical_and_arithmetical_means_of_end-vertex_degrees_of_edges","222254320_Graph_Theory_and_Molecular_Orbitals_Total_-Electron_Energy_of_Alternant_Hydrocarbons","220522029_The_Vertex-Connectivity_Index_Revisited","220189896_Extremal_graphs_for_weights"]}
