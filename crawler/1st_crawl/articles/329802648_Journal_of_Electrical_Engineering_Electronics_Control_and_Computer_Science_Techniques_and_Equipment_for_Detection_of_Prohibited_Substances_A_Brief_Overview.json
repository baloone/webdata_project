Security threats are increasing every year and the demand for better detection techniques is higher. As a result, many techniques for detection of prohibited substances have been developed over the time. This paper presents a brief overview of existing commercial and laboratory techniques for detection of prohibited substances, such as explosives, drugs and toxic substances. Trace and bulk detection techniques are investigated by detailing the working principle, giving examples of equipment and performing a comparative analysis based on advantages and disadvantages of each technique.","authors":["Cristian Monea"],"meta":["November 2018"],"references":[]}
