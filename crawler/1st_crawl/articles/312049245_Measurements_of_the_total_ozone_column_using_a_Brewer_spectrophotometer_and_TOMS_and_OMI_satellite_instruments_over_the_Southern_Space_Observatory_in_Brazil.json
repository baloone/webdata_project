The TOC was measured by a Brewer spectrometer, and the results are also compared to daily and monthly observations from the TOMS (Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer) and OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument) satellite instruments. Analyses of the main interannual modes of variability computed using the wavelet transform method were performed. A favorable agreement between the Brewer spectrophotometer and satellite datasets was found. The seasonal TOC variation is dominated by an annual cycle, with a minimum of approximately 260 DU in April and a maximum of approximately 295 DU in September. The wavelet analysis applied in the SSO TOC anomaly time series revealed that the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) modulation was the main mode of interannual variability. The comparison between the SSO TOC anomaly time series with the QBO index revealed that the two are in opposite phases.","authors":["Lucas Vaz Peres","Hassan Bencherif","Nkanyiso Mbatha","André Passaglia Schuch"],"meta":["January 2017Annales Geophysicae 35(1):25-37","DOI:10.5194/angeo-35-25-2017","Project: ARSAIO (Atmospheric Research in Southern Africa and the Indian Ocean)"],"references":["307845386_NDACCSAOZ_UV-visible_total_ozone_measurements_improved_retrieval_and_comparison_with_correlative_ground-based_and_satellite_observations","304496658_Influence_of_the_Antartic_Ozone_Hole_over_South_of_Brazil_in_2010_and_2011","282242275_Comparison_of_total_column_ozone_obtained_by_the_IASI-MetOp_satellite_with_ground-based_and_OMI_satellite_observations_in_the_southern_tropics_and_subtropics","260085938_A_global_climatology_of_stratosphere-troposphere_exchange_using_the_ERA-Interim_data_set_from_1979_to_2011","313498640_A_new_release_of_data_from_the_Total_Ozone_Mapping_Spectrometer_TOMS","302202768_Observations_of_the_amount_of_ozone_in_the_earth's_atmosphere_and_its_relation_to_other_geophysical_conditions","278641614_Isolation_of_the_Ozone_QBO_in_SAGE_II_data_by_singular-value_decomposition","276066606_Identification_of_influential_events_concerning_the_Antarctic_ozone_hole_over_southern_Brazil_and_the_biological_effects_induced_by_UVB_and_UVA_radiation_in_an_endemic_treefrog_species","266389384_A_Practical_Guide_to_Wavelet_Analysis","258948741_The_Automated_Brewer_Spectrophotometer"]}
