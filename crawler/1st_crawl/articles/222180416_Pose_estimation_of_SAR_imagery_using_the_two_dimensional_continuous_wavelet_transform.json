{"id":"222180416_Pose_estimation_of_SAR_imagery_using_the_two_dimensional_continuous_wavelet_transform","abstract":"We develop a novel pose estimation technique for synthetic aperture radar image chips based on the 2-D continuous wavelet transform (CWT). The pose estimator exploits a fast approximation of the 2-D CWT so that its computational complexity is comparable to a principle component analysis (PCA) based approach. By incorporating energy from various scales, the CWT approach is more robust than the PCA method. Experiments over the MSTAR database confirm the robustness of the CWT method.","authors":["Lance Kaplan","Romain Murenzi"],"meta":["October 2003Pattern Recognition Letters 24(14):2269-2280","DOI:10.1016/S0167-8655(03)00053-9","SourceDBLP"],"references":["235025175_Computational_Complexity_of_the_Continuous_Wavelet_Transform_in_Two_Dimensions","220182992_Texture_Features_for_Browsing_and_Retrieval_of_Image_Data","3192100_Mallat_SG_A_Theory_of_Multiresolution_Signal_Decomposition_The_Wavelet_Representation_IEEE_Trans_Pattern_Anal_Machine_Intell_11_674-693","2707763_SAR_ATR_via_pose-tagged_partial_evidence_fusion","2585702_A_Model_for_Collaborative_Services_in_Distributed_Learning_Environments","2242346_Pose_Estimation_in_SAR_using_an_Information_Theoretic_Criterion","255672924_Performance_Analysis_of_ATR_from_SAR_Imagery","252835344_Feature_space_trajectory_for_distorted-object_classification_and_pose_estimation_in_synthetic_aperture_radar","252156410_Multicriterion_vehicle_pose_estimation_for_SAR_ATR","248540894_A_Theory_of_Multiresolution_Signal_Decomposition_The_Wavelet_Representation","225304623_Inroduction_to_Statistical_Pattern_Recognition","222456891_Two-dimensional_directional_wavelets_and_the_scale-angle_representation","222455388_Directional_Wavelets_Revisited_Cauchy_Wavelets_and_Symmetry_Detection_in_Patterns","5562202_A_new_look_at_spotlight_mode_synthetic_aperture_radar_as_tomography_Imaging_3-D_targets","3077656_The_wavelet_transform_time-frequency_localization_and_signal_analysis","3002699_Effects_of_polarization_and_resolution_on_SAR_ATR"]}
