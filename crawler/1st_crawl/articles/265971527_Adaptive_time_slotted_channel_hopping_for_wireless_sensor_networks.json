{"id":"265971527_Adaptive_time_slotted_channel_hopping_for_wireless_sensor_networks","abstract":"The performance of wireless sensor networks (WSN) is prone to adverse influences from a number of factors such as the interference from co-located wireless systems utilising the same spectral space. Channel hopping technique was proposed to mitigate the problem via periodic change of the operating frequency, and has been adopted in the form of time slotted channel hopping (TSCH) by IEEE 802.15.4e standard. This paper proposes adaptive slotted channel hopping (A-TSCH), an enhanced version of the TSCH aided by blacklisting technique. Complete design and implementation specifics are provided; and the results of experiments are analysed to show its advantages over existing TSCH. The main finding of this work is that A-TSCH can significantly improve the reliability of channel hopping scheme and thus provide better protection from interference for wireless sensor networks.","authors":["Peng Du","George Roussos"],"meta":["September 2012","DOI:10.1109/CEEC.2012.6375374","Conference: Computer Science and Electronic Engineering ConferenceAt: Colchester"],"references":["228555393_TSMP_Time_synchronized_mesh_protocol","224677468_Radio_Channel_Quality_in_Industrial_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","224564885_Investigating_WirelessHART_coexistence_issues_through_a_specifically_designed_simulator","224298045_A_Kalman_Filter_Based_Link_Quality_Estimation_Scheme_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","221284066_Foresee_4C_Wireless_link_prediction_using_link_features","221251794_Reliability_Through_Frequency_Diversity_Why_Channel_Hopping_Makes_Sense","221138007_Frequency_Agility_in_IPv6-Based_Wireless_Personal_Area_Networks_6LoWPAN","220099233_Performance_Improvement_of_Wireless_Communications_Using_Frequency_Hopping_Spread_Spectrum","43336422_Survey_on_Wireless_Sensor_Network_Technologies_for_Industrial_Automation_The_Security_and_Quality_of_Service_Perspectives","255564267_Exploiting_Channel_Diversity_in_White_Spaces","242382586_Distributed_cognitive_coexistence_of_802154_with_80211","241618308_Interference_Avoidance_in_Wireless_Multihop_Networks","241193519_Adaptive_channel_hopping_for_wireless_sensor_networks","238576299_RSSI_is_under_appreciated","234785537_Feasibility_Analysis_of_Controller_Design_for_Adaptive_Channel_Hopping","224608051_Impact_of_Wi-Fi_traffic_on_the_IEEE_802154_channels_occupation_in_indoor_environments","224392604_A_Survey_of_Spectrum_Sensing_Algorithms_for_Cognitive_Radio_Applications","222533223_NeXt_GenerationDynamic_Spectrum_AccessCognitive_Radio_Wireless_Networks_A_Survey","221172170_DH-MAC_a_dynamic_channel_hopping_MAC_protocol_for_cognitive_radio_networks","37598366_High-throughput_routing_for_multi-hop_wireless_networks","3236042_Haykin_S_Cognitive_radio_Brain-empowered_wireless_communications_IEEE_JSAC_232_201-220"]}
