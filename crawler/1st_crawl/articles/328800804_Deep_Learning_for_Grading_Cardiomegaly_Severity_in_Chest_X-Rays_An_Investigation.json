First, we employ and fine-tune\nseveral deep CNN architectures to detect the presence of cardiomegaly in CXRs. Next, we introduce a CXR-based pre-trained model where we first fully train an architecture with an extensive CXR dataset and then fine-tune the system with cardiomegaly CXRs. Finally, we investigate the correlation between the softmax probability of architecture and the severity of the disease. We use two publicly available datasets, NLM-Indiana Collection, and NIH-CXR datasets. Based on our preliminary results (i) data-driven approach produces better results than prior rule-based approaches developed for cardiomegaly detection, (ii) our preliminary experiment with an alternative pre-trained model is promising, and (iii) the system is more confident if severity increases. \nhttps://lhncbc.nlm.nih.gov/system/files/pub9872.pdf","authors":["Sema Candemir","Sivaramakrishnan Rajaraman","Sameer K Antani","George R.
