{"id":"342816885_Construction_and_application_of_digital_creative_platform_for_digital_creative_industry_based_on_smart_city_concept","abstract":"Smart cities use the resources of the new generation of information technology and broadband networks to leverage the advantages of information and communication to build a smart environment for urban development, provide efficient and flexible support for urban management and operations, and provide more humane and more convenient services to the public. The ability to manage and control is a necessary condition for realizing a smart city. This paper uses video streaming media forwarding technology to create a digital creative industry based on the concept of smart city to encourage the public to actively participate in it, effectively promote the promotion and dissemination of cultural heritage. Based on the design goals, architecture, user groups and licensing operations, this paper expounds the idea of constructing cultural heritage management based on the concept of smart city. On this basis, the application selection and effect of the platform are evaluated initially, and the prospect is put forward.","authors":["Xiang Yong","Tian Xinxin","Zhou Su","Wei Yao"],"meta":["October 2020Computers & Electrical Engineering 87(12):106748","DOI:10.1016/j.compeleceng.2020.106748"],"references":["333403831_Government_subsidies-based_profits_distribution_pattern_analysis_in_closed-loop_supply_chain_using_game_theory","330068408_An_adaptive_QoS_computation_for_medical_data_processing_in_intelligent_healthcare_applications","322708110_CPU_versus_GPU_which_can_perform_matrix_computation_faster-performance_comparison_for_basic_linear_algebra_subprograms","320205578_Public-private_collaboration_in_spatial_data_infrastructure_Overview_of_exposure_acceptance_and_sharing_platform_in_Malaysia","317747279_Models_for_Multimedia_Mobile_Cloud_in_Smart_Cities","317063298_A_trustworthy_multimedia_participatory_platform_for_cultural_heritage_management_in_smart_city_environments","301775259_Computing_brains_learning_algorithms_and_neurocomputation_in_the_smart_city","323994076_Mobile_Sharing_Platform_Operation_Model_and_System_Dynamic_Analysis_Uber_and_Taiwan_Taxi_as_Examples","321960039_Efficient_interaction_algorithm_of_multi-thread_data_under_resource_sharing_platform","321847792_Greening_the_Smart_Cities_Energy-Efficient_Massive_Content_Delivery_via_D2D_Communications","321793071_Secure_Multimedia_Big_Data_in_Trust-Assisted_Sensor-Cloud_for_Smart_City","321066392_Research_on_the_Construction_of_Resource_Sharing_Platform_Based_on_MicroService","319969950_English_Teaching_Platform_Research_Based_on_Multimedia_Technology_under_Network_Environment","319694960_Coopetition_and_Profit_Sharing_for_Ride-Sharing_Platforms","319266664_Research_on_Energy_Interconnection_Oriented_Big_Data_Sharing_Platform_Reference_Architecture","317620506_Multimedia_Multimetric_Map-Aware_Routing_Protocol_to_Send_Video-Reporting_Messages_Over_VANETs_in_Smart_Cities","315903395_An_analysis_of_data_sharing_platforms_in_multidisciplinary_education","313991305_MMDES_Multimedia_Digital_Ecosystem_New_Platform_for_Collaboration_and_Sharing","313948229_A_model_for_the_analysis_of_data-driven_innovation_and_value_generation_in_smart_cities'_ecosystems","312572512_Research_on_Science_and_Technology_Service_Sharing_Platform_Based_on_Cloud_Computing_Technology"]}
