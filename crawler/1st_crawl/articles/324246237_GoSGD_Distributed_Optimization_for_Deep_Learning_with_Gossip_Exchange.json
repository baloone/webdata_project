{"id":"324246237_GoSGD_Distributed_Optimization_for_Deep_Learning_with_Gossip_Exchange","abstract":"We address the issue of speeding up the training of convolutional neural networks by studying a distributed method adapted to stochastic gradient descent. Our parallel optimization setup uses several threads, each applying individual gradient descents on a local variable. We propose a new way of sharing information between different threads based on gossip algorithms that show good consensus convergence properties. Our method called GoSGD has the advantage to be fully asynchronous and decentralized.","authors":["Michael Blot","David Picard","Nicolas Thome","Matthieu Cord"],"meta":["November 2018Neurocomputing","DOI:10.1016/j.neucom.2018.11.002"],"references":["319770123_Densely_Connected_Convolutional_Networks","306885833_Densely_Connected_Convolutional_Networks","303859286_Gossip_Dual_Averaging_for_Decentralized_Optimization_of_Pairwise_Functions","303545237_Theano-MPI_a_Theano-based_Distributed_Training_Framework","276099249_Asynchronous_gossip_principal_components_analysis","309076254_Gradientbased_learning_applied_to_document_recognition","306218037_Learning_multiple_layers_of_features_from_tiny_images","291735245_Regularization_of_neural_networks_using_dropconnect","286512696_Deep_Residual_Learning_for_Image_Recognition","278651717_The_Nature_of_Statistical_Learning_Theory"]}
