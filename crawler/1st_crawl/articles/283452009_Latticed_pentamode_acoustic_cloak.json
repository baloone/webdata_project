{"id":"283452009_Latticed_pentamode_acoustic_cloak","abstract":"We report in this work a practical design of pentamode acoustic cloak with microstructure. The proposed cloak is assembled by pentamode lattice made of a single-phase solid material. The function of rerouting acoustic wave round an obstacle has been demonstrated numerically. It is also revealed that shear related resonance due to weak shear resistance in practical pentamode lattices punctures broadband feature predicted based on ideal pentamode cloak. As a consequence, the latticed pentamode cloak can only conceal the obstacle in segmented frequency ranges. We have also shown that the shear resonance can be largely reduced by introducing material damping, and an improved broadband performance can be achieved. These works pave the way for experimental demonstration of pentamode acoustic cloak.","authors":["Yi Chen","Xiaoning Liu","Gengkai Hu"],"meta":["October 2015Scientific Reports 5(1):15745","DOI:10.1038/srep15745"],"references":["263290887_An_elasto-mechanical_unfeelability_cloak_made_of_pentamode_metamaterials","253331641_Highly_Anisotropic_Elements_for_Acoustic_Pentamode_Applications","249505453_Which_Elasticity_Tensors_are_Realizable","236974349_On_anisotropic_versions_of_three-dimensional_pentamode_metamaterials","234890423_Acoustic_cloaking_in_three_dimensions_using_acoustic_metamaterials","232064326_Special_transformations_for_pentamode_acoustic_cloaking","231120819_On_cloaking_for_elasticity_and_physical_equations_with_a_transformation_invariant_form","292792509_Controlling_electromagnetic_fields","260645264_Three-dimensional_broadband_omnidirectional_acoustic_ground_cloak","232064325_Optimizing_imperfect_cloaks_to_perfection"]}
