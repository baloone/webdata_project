{"id":"232978745_The_Introductory_Computer_Course_Business_Majors'_Perceived_Importance_of_Topics","abstract":"An introductory computer information systems (CIS) course has the critical role of teaching computer information concepts to business majors. Though the importance of the course is generally acknowledged, the course is ofter perceived by students as difficult and tedious. To design the course effectively and to make it more interesting and relevant to the students, instructors may need to assess the attitudes of the students toward the course topics. The purpose of this study is to investigate the perceived importance of each topic relative to the major and class level of the students. One hundred sixty-two business majors in a midwestern university participated in the survey. The study indicates that “hands-on” exercises are considered to be the most important topics in the course. The students in upper level classes rated several topics as less important than did the introductory level students.","authors":["Chung S.
