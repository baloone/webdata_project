{"id":"281450731_On_the_Complete_Width_and_Edge_Clique_Cover_Problems","abstract":"A complete graph is the graph in which every two vertices are adjacent. For a graph \\(G=(V,E)\\), the complete width of G is the minimum k such that there exist k independent sets \\(\\mathtt {N}_i\\subseteq V\\), \\(1\\le i\\le k\\), such that the graph \\(G'\\) obtained from G by adding some new edges between certain vertices inside the sets \\(\\mathtt {N}_i\\), \\(1\\le i\\le k\\), is a complete graph. The complete width problem is to compute the complete width of a given graph. In this paper we study the complete width problem. We show that the complete width problem is NP-hard on \\(3K_2\\)-free bipartite graphs and polynomially solvable on \\(2K_2\\)-free bipartite graphs and on \\((2K_2,C_4)\\)-free graphs. As a by-product, we obtain the following new results: the edge clique cover problem is NP-complete on \\(K_{2,2,2}\\)-free co-bipartite graphs and polynomially solvable on \\(K_{2,2}\\)-free co-bipartite graphs and on \\((2K_2, C_4)\\)-free graphs. We also determine all graphs of small complete width \\(k\\le 3\\).","authors":["Van Bang Le","Sheng-Lung Peng"],"meta":["August 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-21398-9_42","Conference: 21st Annual International Computing and Combinatorics Conference (COCOON 2015)"],"references":["279179726_Good_characterizations_and_linear_time_recognition_for_2-probe_block_graphs","279061559_Characterizing_and_recognizing_probe_block_graphs","290453010_Known_Algorithms_for_Edge_Clique_Cover_are_Probably_Optimal","266982852_Intersection_number_and_edge_clique_graphs_of_chordal_and_strongly_chordal_graphs","265444199_Complexity_of_graph_covering_problems_for_graphs_of_low_degree","265435621_Algorithm_Graph_Theory_and_Perfect_Graphs","261844301_Graphs_with_no_induced_C_4_and_2_K_2","248087310_Threshold_Graphs_and_Related_Topics","245671935_Clique_covering_of_chordal_graphs","242630892_Contentment_in_graph_theory_Covering_graphs_with_cliques"]}
