{"id":"243776483_Knapsack_Type_Cryptosystems_and_Algebraic_Coding_Theory","abstract":"Recently Chor and Rivest proposed a knapsack-type cryptosystem for low-weight message vectors. We introduce cryptosystems of this type involving public keys with fewer bits and yielding a higher information rate than the Chor-Rivest cryptosystem. The design of these cryptosystems is based on techniques from algebraic coding theory.","authors":["H. Niederreiter"],"meta":["January 1986"],"references":[]}
