{"id":"350951211_Computing_Exact_Values_for_Gutman_Indices_of_Sum_Graphs_under_Cartesian_Product","abstract":"Gutman index of a connected graph is a degree-distance-based topological index. In extremal theory of graphs, there is great interest in computing such indices because of their importance in correlating the properties of several chemical compounds. In this paper, we compute the exact formulae of the Gutman indices for the four sum graphs (S-sum, R-sum, Q-sum, and T-sum) in the terms of various indices of their factor graphs, where sum graphs are obtained under the subdivision operations and Cartesian products of graphs. We also provide specific examples of our results and draw a comparison with previously known bounds for the four sum graphs.","authors":["Abdulaziz Mohammed Alanazi","Faiz Farid","Muhammad Javaid","Augustine Munagi"],"meta":["April 2021Mathematical Problems in Engineering 2021(5):1-20","DOI:10.1155/2021/5569997"],"references":["351992378_Computing_Analysis_for_First_Zagreb_Connection_Index_and_Coindex_of_Resultant_Graphs","350508273_Computing_FGZ_Index_of_Sum_Graphs_under_Strong_Product","349744079_Bounds_of_Degree-Based_Molecular_Descriptors_for_Generalized_F_-sum_Graphs","348359757_Computing_Analysis_of_Zagreb_Indices_for_Generalized_Sum_Graphs_under_Strong_Product","347541665_First_General_Zagreb_Index_of_Generalized_F-sum_Graphs","337822968_Computing_Topological_Indices_for_Para-Line_Graphs_of_Anthracene_413","337231023_Exact_Formula_and_Improved_Bounds_for_General_Sum-Connectivity_Index_of_Graph-Operations","334780735_Computing_Zagreb_Indices_of_the_Subdivision-Related_Generalized_Operations_of_Graphs","344343053_FORGOTTEN_INDEX_OF_GENERALIZED_F-SUM_GRAPHS","342319297_Computing_the_topological_descriptors_of_line_graph_of_the_complete_m-ary_trees"]}
