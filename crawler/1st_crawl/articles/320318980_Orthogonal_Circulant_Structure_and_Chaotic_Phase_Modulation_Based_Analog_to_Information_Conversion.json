{"id":"320318980_Orthogonal_Circulant_Structure_and_Chaotic_Phase_Modulation_Based_Analog_to_Information_Conversion","abstract":"Modulated wideband converter (MWC) is used to implement analog to information conversion (AIC) to realize sub-Nyquist sampling of sparse multiband analog signal. In this paper, we combine orthogonal circulant matrix with chaos to develop an orthogonal circulant structure and chaotic phase modulation based modulated wideband converter (OCSCPM-MWC). Firstly, random waveforms of different channels in the system correspond to the row vectors of measurement matrix. We use the frequency-domain approach to construct orthogonal circulant matrix. The waveforms of different channels can be generated by various cyclic shifts of the same original waveform and orthogonal to each other. This can greatly reduce the degrees of freedom of the random waveforms, and a superior recovery performance can be obtained. Secondly, we construct chaotic phases of generating elements of orthogonal circulant matrix. The input signal is modulated according to the power spectrum of chaos. We derive the theoretical condition for the orthogonal circulant measurement matrix to satisfy expected restricted isometry property (ExRIP). In addition, we analyze the impact of measurement noise and signal noise on the OCSCPM-MWC system, respectively. Computer simulations are carried out under different situations and they confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","authors":["Ren Wang","Jingbo Guo","Henry Leung"],"meta":["October 2017Signal Processing 144","DOI:10.1016/j.sigpro.2017.10.003"],"references":["286892212_Compressed_Sampling_of_Spectrally_Sparse_Signals_Using_Sparse_Circulant_Matrices","282594357_Data-Assisted_Low_Complexity_Compressive_Spectrum_Sensing_on_Real-Time_Signals_under_Sub-Nyquist_Rate","260330866_Certifying_the_Restricted_Isometry_Property_is_Hard","239766725_Design_and_Analysis_of_a_Hardware-Efficient_Compressed_Sensing_Architecture_for_Data_Compression_in_Wireless_Sensors","232718578_Convolutional_Compressed_Sensing_Using_Deterministic_Sequences","224714678_Theory_and_Implementation_of_an_Analog-to-Information_Converter_using_Random_Demodulation","224093755_Beyond_Nyquist_Efficient_Sampling_of_Sparse_Bandlimited_Signals","224060222_Random_Sampling_for_Analog-to-Information_Conversion_of_Wideband_Signals","47615713_Compressive_Sensing_With_Chaotic_Sequence","4328669_Implementation_models_for_analog-to-information_conversion_via_random_sampling","3324089_Spectral_propertiesof_chaos-based_FM_signals_Theory_and_simulation_results","3323613_Chaos-based_random_number_generators_-_Part_II_Practical_realization","3085823_Compressed_Sensing","3080190_Perfect_reconstruction_formulas_and_bounds_on_aliasing_error_in_sub-Nyquist_nonuniform_sampling_of_multiband_signals","275671857_Compressive_wideband_spectrum_sensing_based_on_single_channel","273393857_Theory_and_Design_of_a_Quadrature_Analog-to-Information_Converter_for_Energy-Efficient_Wideband_Spectrum_Sensing","269634058_Robust_Uncertainty_Principles_Exact_Signal_Frequency_Information","269295311_Sub-Nyquist_sampling_of_OFDM_signals_for_cognitive_radios","261457669_Random_circulant_orthogonal_matrix_based_Analog_Compressed_Sensing","261039761_Compressed_sampling_based_on_circulant_matrix_for_analog_signals","260637752_Xampling_Signal_Acquisition_and_Processing_in_Union_of_Subspaces","260637629_The_Pros_and_Cons_of_Compressive_Sensing_for_Wideband_Signal_Acquisition_Noise_Folding_vs_Dynamic_Range","260522166_Compressive_Circulant_Matrix_Based_Analog_to_Information_Conversion","260500471_Subsampled_circulant_matrix_based_analogue_compressed_sensing","260490274_A_Probabilistic_and_RIPless_Theory_of_Compressed_Sensing","254061025_Sparsity_Order_Estimation_and_its_Application_in_Compressive_Spectrum_Sensing_for_Cognitive_Radios","227786084_On_sparse_reconstruction_from_Fourier_and_Gaussian_measurements","225400588_Necessary_density_conditions_for_sampling_and_interpolation_of_certain_entire_functions","224513791_A_Simple_Proof_of_the_Restricted_Isometry_Property_for_Random_Matrices","224371122_Blind_Multiband_Signal_Reconstruction_Compressed_Sensing_for_Analog_Signals","224242375_Noise_Folding_in_Compressed_Sensing","224242299_Wideband_Spectrum_Sensing_at_Sub-Nyquist_Rates","224191151_Segmented_Compressed_Sampling_for_Analog-to-Information_Conversion_Method_and_Performance_Analysis","224117944_From_Theory_to_Practice_Sub-Nyquist_Sampling_of_Sparse_Wideband_Analog_Signals","222560342_Algorithms_for_simultaneous_sparse_approximation_Part_I_Greedy_pursuit","220124338_Compressive_Sensing_by_Random_Convolution","3357748_Assessment_of_chaos-based_FM_signals_for_range-Doppler_imaging","3325080_Periodically_nonuniform_sampling_of_bandpass_signals","3321063_Reduce_and_Boost_Recovering_Arbitrary_Sets_of_Jointly_Sparse_Vectors","3086165_Near-Optimal_Signal_Recovery_From_Random_Projections_Universal_Encoding_Strategies","3085640_Decoding_by_Linear_Programming","3082399_Lower_bounds_on_the_maximum_cross_correlation_of_signals_Corresp","2133555_Sparsity_and_Incoherence_in_Compressive_Sampling","2118196_Stable_Signal_Recovery_from_Incomplete_and_Inaccurate_Measurements"]}
