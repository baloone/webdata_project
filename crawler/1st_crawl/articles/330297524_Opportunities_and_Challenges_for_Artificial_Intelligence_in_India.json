{"id":"330297524_Opportunities_and_Challenges_for_Artificial_Intelligence_in_India","abstract":"In the future of India lies the future of a sixth of the world's population. As the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution sweeps through societies and enters daily life, its role in shaping India's development and growth is bound to be substantial. For India, AI holds promise as a catalyst to accelerate progress, while providing mechanisms to leapfrog traditional hurdles such as poor infrastructure and bureaucracy. At the same time, an investment in AI is accompanied by risk factors with long-term implications on society: it is imperative that risks be vetted at this early stage. In this paper, we describe opportunities and challenges for AI in India. We detail opportunities that are cross-cutting (bridging India's linguistic divisions, mining public data), and also specific to one particular sector (healthcare). We list challenges that originate from existing social conditions (such as equations of caste and gender). Thereafter we distill out concrete steps and safeguards, which we believe are necessary for robust and inclusive development as India enters the AI era.","authors":["Shivaram Kalyanakrishnan","Rahul Alex Panicker","Sarayu Natarajan","Shreya Rao"],"meta":["December 2018","DOI:10.1145/3278721.3278738","Conference: the 2018 AAAI/ACM Conference"],"references":["311464076_State_of_newborn_health_in_India","305615978_Man_is_to_Computer_Programmer_as_Woman_is_to_Homemaker_Debiasing_Word_Embeddings","305233854_Automated_Microscopy_and_Machine_Learning_for_Expert-Level_Malaria_Field_Diagnosis","292074166_Mastering_the_game_of_Go_with_deep_neural_networks_and_tree_search","283883942_Articles_Symptoms_and_medical_conditions_in_204_912_patients_visiting_primary_health-care_practitioners_in_India_a_1-day_point_prevalence_study_the_POSEIDON_study","283883691_Symptoms_and_medical_conditions_in_204_912_patients_visiting_primary_health-care_practitioners_in_India_a_1-day_point_prevalence_study_the_POSEIDON_study","260370435_Beyond_job_security_and_money_Driving_factors_of_motivation_for_government_doctors_in_India","259118437_Automatic_speech_recognition_for_under-resourced_languages_A_survey","257156734_Does_Access_to_Formal_Agricultural_Credit_Depend_on_Caste","255177784_Corruption_in_Healthcare_and_Medicine_Why_Should_Physicians_and_Bioethicists_Care_and_What_Should_They_Do","221012725_Improved_Statistical_Machine_Translation_for_Resource-Poor_Languages_Using_Related_Resource-Rich_Languages","220415267_Networks_of_Science_and_Technology_in_India_The_Elite_and_the_Subaltern_Streams","347512647_Deliberative_Democracy_in_India","329977581_The_Language_Demographics_of_Amazon_Mechanical_Turk","323320918_Computer_Vision_Detects_Subtle_Histological_Effects_of_Dutasteride_on_Benign_Prostate","321002348_The_Taking_Economy_Uber_Information_and_Power","320186279_Artificial_Intelligence_Research_in_Singapore_Assisting_the_Development_of_a_Smart_Nation","317752024_The_israeli_AI_community","308646556_Google's_Neural_Machine_Translation_System_Bridging_the_Gap_between_Human_and_Machine_Translation","290930830_Wasting_away_the_crisis_of_malnutrition_in_India","289797080_A_Perspective_on_AI_Research_in_India","280117537_Advances_in_natural_language_processing","265859279_Moving_the_centre_to_design_social_media_in_rural_Africa","264124524_Are_theories_applicable_across_different_contexts_A_cross-national_comparative_analysis_through_the_lens_of_firm_life-cycle_theory_in_the_ICT_sector","261890056_Caste_Discrimination_in_the_Indian_Urban_Labour_Market_Evidence_from_the_National_Sample_Survey","228379274_EuroParl_A_parallel_corpus_for_statistical_machine_translation","222395434_Labor_market_discrimination_in_Delhi_Evidence_from_a_field_experiment","220415164_The_Myth_of_the_Moral_Neutrality_of_Technology","220414905_The_'Japan_Problem'_in_science_and_technology_and_basic_research_as_a_culture","220414594_Women_and_the_Social_Construction_of_the_Computing_Culture_Evolving_New_Forms_of_Computing","220414465_Science_technology_and_society_in_East_Asia_Frameworks_for_the_challenges_of_the_next_century","51786104_Systematic_Analysis_of_Breast_Cancer_Morphology_Uncovers_Stromal_Features_Associated_with_Survival","46181325_Integration_of_Early_Physiological_Responses_Predicts_Later_Illness_Severity_in_Preterm_Infants","4826417_Caste_discrimination_in_the_Indian_urban_labour_market","2537401_Scaling_to_Very_Very_Large_Corpora_for_Natural_Language_Disambiguation"]}
