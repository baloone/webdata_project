From this perspective, control theory is an important research avenue in operations and supply chain management. We briefly survey the applications of control theory to engineering and management problems in supply chains and operations areas during the period 1960-2017. Our analysis is based on bridging the fundamentals of control and systems theory to supply chains and operations management. Although operations and supply chain systems resemble control systems, they have some peculiarities which do not allow a direct application of control theoretic methods. The required modifications and possible limitations are discussed. In this setting, further development of interdisciplinary approaches to supply chain optimization is argued.","authors":["Alexandre Dolgui","Dmitry Ivanov","Suresh Sethi","Boris vladimirovich Sokolov"],"meta":["January 2018IFAC-PapersOnLine 51(11):1536-1541","DOI:10.1016/j.ifacol.2018.08.279","Projects: Supply chain design resilience assessment with structure dynamics considerationsSupply Chain Management"],"references":["323573098_Scheduling_in_production_supply_chain_and_Industry_40_systems_by_optimal_control","320987679_Structural_Dynamics_and_Resilience_in_Supply_Chain_Risk_Management","292342553_Robust_dynamic_schedule_coordination_control_in_the_supply_chain","291353897_Schedule_robustness_analysis_with_the_help_of_attainable_sets_in_continuous_flow_problem_under_capacity_disruptions","324365930_The_Mathematical_Theory_of_Optimal_Control","322276906_Adaptive_Control_Processes_A_Guided_Tour","321568632_Optimal_Control_Theory_Applications_to_Management_Science_and_Economics","313806628_Investigating_sustained_oscillations_in_nonlinear_production_and_inventory_control_models","292633143_A_survey_of_stackelberg_differential_game_models_in_supply_and_marketing_channels","287507723_A_technique_to_develop_simplified_and_linearised_models_of_complex_dynamic_supply_chain_systems"]}
