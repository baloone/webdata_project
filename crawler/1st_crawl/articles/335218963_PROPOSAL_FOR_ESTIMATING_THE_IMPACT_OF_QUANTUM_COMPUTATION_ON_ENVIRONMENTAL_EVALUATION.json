{"id":"335218963_PROPOSAL_FOR_ESTIMATING_THE_IMPACT_OF_QUANTUM_COMPUTATION_ON_ENVIRONMENTAL_EVALUATION","abstract":"Environmental evaluation is performed through three primary scientific tools which are (I) direct field observations; (ii) laboratory scale tests and physical modeling studies; and, (iii) mathematical modeling. Now days both of physical modeling and mathematical modeling are performed by computer programs. For some cases these programs takes several days or may be several weeks to accomplish the required modeling. These programs are working according to a classical computation via classical computer. If these programs are working according to a quantum computation via quantum computer then they will have significant advantage in terms of speed over the classical computation. Quantum computation also significantly speeds up the database search algorithm, which is important in computer science because it comes as a subroutine in many important algorithms. Quantum database search of Grover achieves the task of finding the target element in an unsorted database in a time much faster than the classical computer. In this work we review the quantum computation, estimate the impact of quantum computation on environmental evaluation. The estimated impact shows speeding up the environmental evaluation by about hundreds times then classical computation.","authors":["Mazhar Hefnawi"],"meta":["August 2019"],"references":["319614139_A_Short_Introduction_to_Topological_Quantum_Computation","263390470_Reachability_Analysis_of_Quantum_Markov_Decision_Processes","318331669_Quantum_game_players_can_have_advantage_without_discord","317220817_The_Palgrave_Handbook_of_Quantum_Models_in_Social_Science_Applications_and_Grand_Challenges","277083857_Quantum_physics_What_is_really_real","265584181_Introduction_to_quantum_computers","253676713_Introducing_Quantum_Theory","236202967_Power_of_the_interactive_proof_systems_with_verifiers_modeled_by_semi-quantum_two-way_finite_automata","222415055_On_the_computational_power_of_probabilistic_and_quantum_branching_program","200524403_Quantum_Computation_and_Quantum_Information","2818380_Polynomial-Time_Algorithms_For_Prime_Factorization_And_Discrete_Logarithms_On_A_Quantum_Computer","2201607_Fast_quantum_mechanical_algorithm_for_database_search"]}
