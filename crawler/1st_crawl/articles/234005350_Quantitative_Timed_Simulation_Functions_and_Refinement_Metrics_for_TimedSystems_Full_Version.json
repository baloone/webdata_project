{"id":"234005350_Quantitative_Timed_Simulation_Functions_and_Refinement_Metrics_for_TimedSystems_Full_Version","abstract":"We introduce quantatitive timed refinement metrics and quantitative timed\nsimulation functions, incorporating zenoness checks,for timed systems. These\nfunctions assign positive real numbers between zero and infinity which quantify\nthe timing mismatches in between two timed systems, amongst non-zeno runs. We\nquantify timing mismatches in three ways: (1) the maximum timing mismatch that\ncan arise, (2) the \"steady-state\" maximum timing mismatches, where initial\ntransient timing mismatches are ignored; and (3) the (long-run) average timing\nmismatches amongst two systems. These three kinds of mismatches constitute\nthree important types of timing differences. Our event times are the global\ntimes, measured from the start of the system execution, not just the time\ndurations of individual steps. We present algorithms over timed automata for\ncomputing the three quantitative simulation functions to within any desired\ndegree of accuracy. In order to compute the values of the quantitative\nsimulation functions, we use a game theoretic formulation. We introduce two new\nkinds of objectives for two player games on finite state game graphs: (1)\neventual debit-sum level objectives, and (2) average debit-sum level\nobjectives. We present algorithms for computing the optimal values for these\nobjectives for player 1, and then use these algorithms to compute the values of\nthe quantitative timed simulation functions.","authors":["Krishnendu Chatterjee","Vinayak S.
