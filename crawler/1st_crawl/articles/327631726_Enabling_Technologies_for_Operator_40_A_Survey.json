{"id":"327631726_Enabling_Technologies_for_Operator_40_A_Survey","abstract":"The fast development of smart sensors and wearable devices has provided the opportunity to develop intelligent operator workspaces. The resultant Human-Cyber-Physical Systems (H-CPS) integrate the operators into flexible and multipurpose manufacturing processes. The primary enabling factor of the resultant Operator 4.0 paradigm is the integration of advanced sensor and actuator technologies and communications solutions. This work provides an extensive overview of these technologies and highlights that the design of future workplaces should be based on the concept of intelligent space.","authors":["Tamas Ruppert","Szilárd Jaskó","Tibor Holczinger","János Abonyi"],"meta":["September 2018Applied Sciences 8(1650)","DOI:10.3390/app8091650","Project: Industry 4.0 - Control, monitoring and optimization of production processes"],"references":["326392969_Strategic_Plan_of_Made_in_China_2025_and_Its_Implementation","324258227_Industrial_wearable_system_the_human-centric_empowering_technology_in_Industry_40","324222694_A_Knowledge-based_Approach_to_Enhance_the_Workforce_Skills_and_Competences_within_the_Industry_40","329469683_INDICS_An_Industrial_Internet_Platform","326922169_Emotion_recognition_from_physiological_signals_using_wireless_sensors_for_presence_technologies","326803803_How_and_why_we_need_to_capture_tacit_knowledge_in_manufacturing_Case_studies_of_visual_inspection","326019448_The_future_of_manufacturing_industry_a_strategic_roadmap_toward_Industry_40","325606783_An_adaptive_control_architecture_for_cyber-physical_system_security_in_the_face_of_sensor_and_actuator_attacks_and_exogenous_stochastic_disturbances","325294118_The_impact_of_industrial_wearable_system_on_industry_40","325239983_Introduction_to_Haptics"]}
