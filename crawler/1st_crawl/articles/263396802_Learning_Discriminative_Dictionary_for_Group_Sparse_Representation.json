{"id":"263396802_Learning_Discriminative_Dictionary_for_Group_Sparse_Representation","abstract":"In recent years, sparse representation has been widely used in object recognition applications. How to learn the dictionary is a key issue to sparse representation. A popular method is to use l1 norm as the sparsity measurement of representation coefficients for dictionary learning. However, the l1 norm treats each atom in the dictionary independently, so the learned dictionary cannot well capture the multi-subspaces structural information of the data. Additionally, the learned subdictionary for each class usually shares some common atoms, which weakens the discriminative ability of the reconstruction error of each sub-dictionary. This paper presents a new dictionary learning model to improve sparse representation for image classification, which targets at learning a class-specific sub-dictionary for each class and a common sub-dictionary shared by all classes. The model is composed of a discriminative fidelity, a weighted group sparse constraint and a sub-dictionary incoherence term. The discriminative fidelity encourages each class-specific sub-dictionary to sparsely represent the samples in the corresponding class. The weighted group sparse constraint term aims at capturing the structural information of the data. The sub-dictionary incoherence term is to make all sub-dictionaries independent as much as possible. Because the common sub-dictionary represents features shared by all classes, we only use the reconstruction error of each class-specific sub-dictionary for classification. Extensive experiments are conducted on several public image databases, and the experimental results demonstrate the power of the proposed method, compared to the state-of-the-arts.","authors":["Yubao Sun","Qingshan Liu","Jinhui Tang","Dacheng Tao"],"meta":["June 2014IEEE Transactions on Image Processing 23(9)","DOI:10.1109/TIP.2014.2331760","SourcePubMed"],"references":["257482053_A_review_of_feature_selection_methods_on_synthetic_data","234768533_Image_Annotation_by_kNN-Sparse_Graph-Based_Label_Propagation_over_Noisily_Tagged_Web_Images","228891808_Efficient_Block-Coordinate_Descent_Algorithms_for_the_Group_Lasso","224164299_Classification_and_clustering_via_dictionary_learning_with_structured_incoherence_and_shared_features","224134574_Sparse_Representation_for_Computer_Vision_and_Pattern_Recognition","221620303_Sparse_Representation_for_Signal_Classification","221364959_Learning_A_Discriminative_Dictionary_for_Sparse_Coding_via_Label_Consistent_K-SVD","221364080_Linear_spatial_pyramid_matching_using_sparse_coding_for_image_classification","221362948_Discriminative_K-SVD_for_dictionary_learning_in_face_recognition","221110091_Fisher_Discrimination_Dictionary_Learning_for_sparse_representation","51961482_Structured_Sparsity_via_Alternating_Direction_Methods","4044602_Sparse_Decompositions_in_incoherent''_dictionaries","3319912_K-SVD_An_Algorithm_for_Designing_Overcomplete_Dictionaries_for_Sparse_Representation","1775282_Supervised_Dictionary_Learning","284221905_Image_annotation_by_kNN-sparse_graph-based_label_propagation_over_noisily-tagged_Web_images","262372016_Low-rank_coding_with_B-matching_constraint_for_semi-supervised_classification","262162161_A_Dictionary_Learning_Approach_for_Classification_Separating_the_Particularity_and_the_Commonality","261121788_Learning_inter-related_visual_dictionary_for_object_recognition","258161093_Sparse_regression_mixture_modeling_with_the_multi-kernel_relevance_vector_machine","258161092_Semi-supervised_classification_based_on_subspace_sparse_representation","257482216_Robust_sparsity-preserved_learning_with_application_to_image_visualization","257481990_Toward_structural_sparsity_An_explicit_l2l0_approach","254058712_A_Block_Fixed_Point_Continuation_Algorithm_for_Block-Sparse_Reconstruction","239317040_Local_Features_and_Kernels_for_Classification_of_Texture_and_Object_Categories_A_Comprehensive_Study","228676874_Signal_Recovery_by_Proximal_Forward-Backward_Splitting","227028645_Projected_gradient_methods_for_linear_constrained_problems","224514197_The_Bene_t_of_Group_Sparsity","224309574_Robust_Face_Recognition_via_Sparse_Representation","224254934_Robust_classification_using_structured_sparse_representation","222480034_Applications_of_Second-Order_Cone_Programming","222427574_Sparse_Regression_Using_Mixed_Norms","221603176_Automatic_Group_Sparse_Coding","221121224_Metaface_learning_for_sparse_representation_based_face_recognition","220589055_A_Coordinate_Gradient_Descent_Method_for_Nonsmooth_Separable_Minimization","220124383_A_Fast_Iterative_Shrinkage-Thresholding_Algorithm_for_Linear_Inverse_Problems","46288565_Features_versus_Context_An_Approach_for_Precise_and_Detailed_Detection_and_Delineation_of_Faces_and_Facial_Features","44618705_Multi-PIE","7864711_Acquiring_Linear_Subspaces_for_Face_Recognition_Under_Variable_Lighting","7641979_A_sparse_texture_representation_using_local_affine_region","7211794_One-Shot_Learning_of_Object_Categories","5582177_Image_Classification_Using_Correlation_Tensor_Analysis","4246227_Beyond_Bags_of_Features_Spatial_Pyramid_Matching_for_Recognizing_Natural_Scene_Categories","4245883_Local_Features_and_Kernels_for_Classification_of_Texture_and_Object_Categories_A_Comprehensive_Study","3807370_Frame_based_signal_compression_using_method_of_Optimal_Directions_MOD","3320429_Matching_Pursuit_With_Block_Incoherent_Dictionaries"]}
