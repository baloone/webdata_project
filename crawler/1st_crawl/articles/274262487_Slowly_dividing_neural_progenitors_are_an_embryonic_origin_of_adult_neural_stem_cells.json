{"id":"274262487_Slowly_dividing_neural_progenitors_are_an_embryonic_origin_of_adult_neural_stem_cells","abstract":"The mechanism by which adult neural stem cells (NSCs) are established during development is unclear. In this study, analysis of cell cycle progression by examining retention of a histone 2B (H2B)-GFP fusion protein revealed that, in a subset of mouse embryonic neural progenitor cells (NPCs), the cell cycle slows between embryonic day (E) 13.5 and E15.5 while other embryonic NPCs continue to divide rapidly. By allowing H2B-GFP expressed at E9.5 to become diluted in dividing cells until the young adult stage, we determined that a majority of NSCs in the young adult subependymal zone (SEZ) originated from these slowly dividing embryonic NPCs. The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p57 is highly expressed in this embryonic subpopulation, and the deletion of p57 impairs the emergence of adult NSCs. Our results suggest that a substantial fraction of adult SEZ NSCs is derived from a slowly dividing subpopulation of embryonic NPCs and identify p57 as a key factor in generating this embryonic origin of adult SEZ NSCs.","authors":["Shohei Furutachi","Hiroaki Miya","Tomoyuki Watanabe","Hiroki Kawai"],"meta":["March 2015Nature Neuroscience 18(5)","DOI:10.1038/nn.3989","SourcePubMed"],"references":["257463576_Transcriptional_repression_of_Bmp2_by_p21_Waf1Cip1_links_quiescence_to_neural_stem_cell_maintenance","236977968_Gsx2_controls_region-specific_activation_of_neural_stem_cells_and_injury-induced_neurogenesis_in_the_adult_subventricular_zone","236929688_Dll1_maintains_quiescence_of_adult_neural_stem_cells_and_segregates_asymmetrically_during_mitosis","236460115_Regulation_of_cerebral_cortex_size_and_folding_by_expansion_of_basal_progenitors","292215722_PTEN_negatively_regulates_neural_stem_cell_self-renewal_by_modulating_G0-G1_cell_cycle_entry","278238980_Positive_feedback_between_PU1_and_the_cell_cycle_controls_myeloid_differentiation_vol_341_pg_670_2013","277000438_The_cell_biology_of_neurogenesis","260374240_Neurogenesis_in_the_Striatum_of_the_Adult_Human_Brain","250920623_Positive_Feedback_Between_PU1_and_the_Cell_Cycle_Controls_Myeloid_Differentiation","236932499_Molecular_regulation_of_stem_cell_quiescence"]}
