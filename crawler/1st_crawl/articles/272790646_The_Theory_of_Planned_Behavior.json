{"id":"272790646_The_Theory_of_Planned_Behavior","abstract":"Research dealing with various aspects of* the theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1985,\n1987) is reviewed, and some unresolved issues are discussed. In broad terms, the theory is\nfound to be well supported by empirical evidence. Intentions to perform behaviors of different\nkinds can be predicted with high accuracy from attitudes toward the behavior, subjective\nnorms, and perceived behavioral control; and these intentions, together with perceptions of\nbehavioral control, account for considerable variance in actual behavior. Attitudes, subjective\nnorms, and perceived behavioral control are shown to be related to appropriate sets of salient\nbehavioral, normative, and control beliefs about the behavior, but the exact nature of these\nrelations is still uncertain. ExpectancyÂ— value formulations are found to be only partly\nsuccessful in dealing with these relations. Optimal rescaling of expectancy and value\nmeasures is offered as a means of dealing with measurement limitations. Finally, inclusion of\npast behavior in the prediction equation is shown to provide a means of testing the theory*s\nsufficiency, another issue that remains unresolved. The limited available evidence concerning\nthis question shows that the theory is predicting behavior quite well in comparison to the\nceiling imposed by behavioral reliability.","authors":["Icek Ajzen"],"meta":["December 1991Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes 50(2):179-211","DOI:10.1016/0749-5978(91)90020-T"],"references":["315161214_An_examination_of_the_Fishbein-Ajzen_behavioral-intentions_model's_concepts_and_measures","298348626_The_Theory_of_Reasoned_Action_A_Meta-Analysis_of_Past_Research_with_Recommendations_for_Modifications_and_Future_Research","317953663_Self-Efficacy_Toward_a_Unifying_Theory_of_Behavioral_Change","312459484_Attitude_formation_under_the_theory_of_reasoned_action_and_a_purposeful_behaviour_reformulation","306151205_Models_of_attitude-behaviorrelations","304534338_Understanding_Attitudes_and_Predicting_Social_Behavior","298348474_The_theory_of_reasoned_action_A_meta-analysis_of_past_research_with_recommendations_for_modifications_and_future_research","297188780_ATTITUDE_ORGANIZATION_AND_THE_ATTITUDE-BEHAVIOR_RELATION_-_A_CRITIQUE_OF_BAGOZZI_AND_BURNKRANT_REANALYSIS_OF_FISHBEIN_AND_AJZEN","297144346_ATTITUDES_INTENTIONS_AND_BEHAVIOR_-_A_TEST_OF_SOME_KEY_HYPOTHESES","292402660_Psychosocial_factors_influencing_intentions_to_exercise_in_a_group_of_individuals_ranging_from_45_to_74_years_of_age"]}
