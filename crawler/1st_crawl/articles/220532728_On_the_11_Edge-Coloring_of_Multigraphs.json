{"id":"220532728_On_the_11_Edge-Coloring_of_Multigraphs","abstract":"A new upper bound is proved for the chromatic index $q^* ( G )$ of multigraphs $G = ( V,E )$. Let $d ( G )$ be the maximum degree of G, and let \\[ p ( G ) = \\text{MAX} \\{ \\lceil 2 | E(X) |/ ( | X | - 1) \\rceil :X \\subset V, | X | \\ne 1\\,\\text{and odd} \\} \\] where $E( X )$ is the set of edges in the subgraph of G induced by X. The upper bound is expressed in terms of the two trivial lower bounds $d ( G )$ and $p ( G )$ as follows: \\[ q^* ( G )\\leqq \\text{MAX} \\{ p ( G ), \\lfloor 1.1 d ( G ) + 0.8 \\rfloor \\}. \\] The proof yields an algorithm which edge-colors any given multigraph G with at most $\\lfloor 1.1q^* ( G ) + 0.8 \\rfloor $ colors. The running time is $O ( | E | ( d ( G ) + | V | ) )$ and the storage space is $O ( | E | )$.","authors":["Takao Nishizeki","Kenichi Kashiwagi"],"meta":["August 1990SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics 3(3):391-410","DOI:10.1137/0403035","SourceDBLP"],"references":["265315348_On_edge-colorings_of_graphs","239279283_A_theorem_on_coloring_the_lines_of_a_network","220688555_The_Design_and_Analysis_Computer_Algorithms","220617300_The_NP-Completeness_of_Edge-Coloring","220406350_A_Better_than_Best_Possible_Algorithm_to_Edge_Color_Multigraphs","31031045_On_Multi-Colourings_of_Cubic_Graphs_and_Conjectures_of_Fulkerson_and_Tutte","3183551_On_the_f-coloring_of_multigraphs"]}
