{"id":"275669881_A_Bayesian_Framework_for_Learning_Rule_Sets_for_Interpretable_Classification","abstract":"We present a machine learning algorithm for building classifiers that are comprised of a \\emph{small} number of \\emph{short} rules. These are restricted disjunctive normal form models. An example of a classifier of this form is as follows: \\emph{If} $X$ satisfies (condition $A$ AND condition $B$) OR (condition $C$) OR $\\cdots$, \\emph{then} $Y=1$. Models of this form have the advantage of being interpretable to human experts, since they produce a set of rules that concisely describe a specific class. We present two probabilistic models with prior parameters that the user can set to encourage the model to have a desired size and shape, to conform with a domain-specific definition of interpretability. We provide a scalable MAP inference approach and theoretical bounds to reduce computation. We apply our method (Bayesian Rule Sets -- \\emph{BRS}) to characterize and predict user behavior with respect to in-vehicle context-aware personalized recommender systems. Our method has a major advantage over classical associative classification methods and decision trees in that it does not greedily grow the model.","authors":["Tong Wang","Cynthia Rudin","Finale Doshi-Velez","Yimin Liu"],"meta":["May 2017Journal of Machine Learning Research 18","SourcearXiv","Project: Interpretable Machine Learning"],"references":["283550136_Bump_hunting_in_high-dimensional_data-Discussion","272422876_Supersparse_Linear_Integer_Models_for_Optimized_Medical_Scoring_Systems","301222357_Toward_the_next_generation_of_recommender_systems_A_survey_of_the_state-of-the-art_and_possible_extensions","285288453_Exact_rule_learning_via_Boolean_compressed_sensing","283478271_Interpretable_classifiers_using_rules_and_Bayesian_analysis_Building_a_better_stroke_prediction_model","272825857_UCI_Machine_Learning_Repository","265548129_Learning_DNF_in_time_2_O_n_13","262389917_Comprehensible_classification_models_A_position_paper","262289166_A_Personalized_Restaurant_Recommender_Agent_for_Mobile_E-Service","262254783_Learning_Theory_Analysis_for_Association_Rules_and_Sequential_Event_Prediction","257818655_Bump_hunting_in_high-dimensional_data","253518973_Disjunctions_of_Conjunctions_Cognitive_Simplicity_and_Consideration_Sets","250199309_Context-awareness_in_Mobile_Tourism_Guides_-_A_Comprehensive_Survey","235328330_User-oriented_Assessment_of_Classification_Model_Understandability","260800706_Box_Drawings_for_Learning_with_Imbalanced_Data"]}
