{"id":"287561380_Remanufacturing_scheduling_systems_an_exploratory_analysis_comparing_academic_research_and_industry_practice","abstract":"We report academic advancements made in remanufacturing scheduling system methodologies, criteria/objective functions, and complexities in the academic literature and compare this to the actual remanufacturing scheduling practices used in industry. Survey data collected from the Automotive Parts Remanufacturers Association (APRA) is analysed to learn the techniques and approaches used to schedule remanufacturing operations and the difficulties encountered. Survey results are compared with academic progress in remanufacturing scheduling and the results of previous related industry surveys. Our analysis reveals that industry employs several scheduling aids (i.e., MRP, JIT, buffer inventories, control of core returns, etc.) for rapid manufacturing and to create a more reliable and predictable process. Areas in need of further study for more rapid manufacturing include: establishing integrated remanufacturing supply chain networks that can handle mixed and shifting competitive strategies, greater involvement ...","authors":["Roger J.
