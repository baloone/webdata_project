{"id":"340636278_Robust_Massive_MIMO_Channel_Estimation_for_5G_Networks_Using_Compressive_Sensing_Technique","abstract":"The pilot overhead provides fundamental limits on the performance of massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. This is because the performance of such systems is based on the failure of the presentation of accurate channel state information (CSI). Based on the theory of compressive sensing, this paper presents a novel channel estimation technique as the mean of minimizing the problems associated with pilot overhead. The proposed technique is based on the combination of the compressive sampling matching and sparsity adaptive matching pursuit techniques. The sources of the signals in MIMO systems are sparsely distributed in terms of spatial correlations. This distribution pattern enables then use of compressive sampling techniques to solve the channel estimation problem in MIMO systems. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed channel estimation outperforms the conventional compressive sensing (CS)-based channel estimation algorithms in terms of the normalized mean square error (NMSE) performance at high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Furthermore, it reduces the computational complexity of the channel estimation compared to conventional methods. In addition to the achieved performance gain in terms of NMSE, the presented method significantly reduces pilot overhead compared to conventional channel estimation techniques.","authors":["Zaid Albataineh","Khaled F.
