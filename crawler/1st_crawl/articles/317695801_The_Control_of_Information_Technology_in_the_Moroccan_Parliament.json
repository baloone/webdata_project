{"id":"317695801_The_Control_of_Information_Technology_in_the_Moroccan_Parliament","abstract":"The control of Information technology in the Moroccan\nParliament is of particular importance in contributing to the\nperformance of the organization and guaranteeing the\ninvestments spent for the proper functioning of its activities\nand putting effective parliamentary work efficiently “good\ngovernance”. However, these systems have not yet benefited\nfrom a model or approach to the exercise of this control and\nthe implementation of its objectives, the theoretical study\ncarried out in this research confirmed this observation.\nCorroborated by an empirical study based on the IT of the\nMoroccan Parliament, this exploration made it possible to\nidentify the type and the level of control applied to this\nspecific system in order to better elucidate the link between\na \"good control\" and a \"state of Performance \"of an IT, and\nfinally this study was the opportunity to propose perspectives\nfor the resolution of this problem.","authors":["Malik Motii","Elalami Semma","Youssef Ait Houaich"],"meta":["June 2017","DOI:10.20943/01201703.3136"],"references":["220591866_The_DeLone_and_McLean_Model_of_Information_Systems_Success_A_Ten-Year_Update","220175139_Information_Systems_and_Developing_Countries_Failure_Success_and_Local_Improvisations","339993385_Most_eGovernment-for-Development_Projects_Fail_How_Can_Risks_be_Reduced","337532982_Management_d'un_projet_systeme_d'information_principes_techniques_mise_en_oeuvre_et_outils","301588383_Systemes_d'Information_et_Management_des_Organisations_-_6eme_edition","267703684_An_Exploratory_Evaluation_of_UK_Local_e-Government_From_an_Accountability_Perspective","247517756_Digital_government_and_its_effectiveness_in_public_management_reform_A_local_government_perspective","244504530_Success_and_Failure_Rates_of_eGovernment_in_DevelopingTransitional_Countries_Overview","240242228_The_Impacts_of_Information_Technology_on_Public_Administration_An_Analysis_of_Empirical_Research_from_the_Golden_Age_of_Transformation","222513022_Critical_success_factors_revisited_Success_and_failure_cases_of_information_systems_for_senior_executives"]}
