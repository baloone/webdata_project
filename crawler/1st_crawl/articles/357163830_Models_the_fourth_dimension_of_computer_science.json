{"id":"357163830_Models_the_fourth_dimension_of_computer_science","abstract":"Models are a universal instrument in science, technology, and daily life. They function as instruments in almost every scenario. Any human activity can be (and is) supported by models, e.g. reason, explain, design, act, predict, explore, communicate, collaborate, interact, orient, direct, guide, socialises, perceive, reflect, develop, making sense, teach, learn, imagine, etc. This universal suitability is also the basis for a wide use of models and modelling in Computer Science and Engineering. We claim that models form the fourth dimension in Computer Science. This paper sketches and systematises the main ingredients of the study model and modelling.","authors":["Bernhard Thalheim"],"meta":["December 2021Software and Systems Modeling","DOI:10.1007/s10270-021-00954-2"],"references":["346471466_The_triptych_of_conceptual_modeling","338685564_Models_To_Model_and_Modelling_-_Towards_a_Theory_of_Models_especially_Conceptual_Models_and_Modelling_-_Third_Collection_of_Recent_Papers_2018-2019","275152525_Multilevel_Modeling_Toward_a_New_Paradigm_of_Conceptual_Modeling_and_Information_Systems_Design","348576566_Schriften_zur_Modellforschung_Herausgegeben_von_Klaus_Robering","335279221_Culture_History","332116970_Design_and_Development_of_Web_Information_Systems","332089344_Great_Principles_of_Computing","273026813_Introduction_to_What_is_Computation","221430261_Modelle_-_Januskopfe_der_Software-Entwicklung_-_oder_Mit_Janus_von_der_A-_zur_S-Klasse","221276300_Some_Guidelines_for_the_Conception_of_Domain-Specific_Modelling_Languages"]}
