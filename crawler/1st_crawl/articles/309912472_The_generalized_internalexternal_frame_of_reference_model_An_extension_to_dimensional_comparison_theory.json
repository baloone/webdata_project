{"id":"309912472_The_generalized_internalexternal_frame_of_reference_model_An_extension_to_dimensional_comparison_theory","abstract":"The dimensional comparison theory (DCT) focuses on the effects of internal, dimensional\ncomparisons (e.g., “How good am I in math compared to English?”) on academic selfconcepts\nwith widespread consequences for students’ self-evaluation, motivation, and\nbehavioral choices. DCT is based on the internal/external frame of reference model (I/E\nmodel) which integrates dimensional and external, social comparisons (e.g., “How good am I\nin math compared to my classmates?”). This article presents an extension, the generalized\nI/E model, which describes effects of dimensional and social comparisons in various areas.\nFirstly, it proposes that such comparisons are carried out not only within the academic area\nbut also within other areas. Secondly, it proposes effects of social and dimensional\ncomparison for other variables besides self-concepts, i.e. for motivational constructs,\nlearning behaviors, or personality characteristics. The present article closes with an\nexamination and discussion of the contributions of the DCT by applying standards of good\ntheories to it.","authors":["Jens Möller","Hanno Müller-Kalthoff","Friederike Helm","Nicole Nagy"],"meta":["January 2016FRONTLINE LEARNING RESEARCH 4(2):1-11","DOI:10.14786/flr.v4i2.169"],"references":["293143413_Communal_and_agentic_content_A_dual_perspective_model","286608903_International_comparisons_of_student_achievement","277726102_Teacher_support_and_its_influence_on_students'_intrinsic_value_and_effort_Dimensional_comparison_effects_across_subjects","274264230_Self-Evaluative_Effects_of_Dimensional_and_Social_Comparison","258182784_A_Meta-Analytic_Path_Analysis_of_the_InternalExternal_Frame_of_Reference_Model_of_Academic_Achievement_and_Academic_Self-Concept","232590740_The_InternalExternal_Frame_of_Reference_Model_Big-Fish-Little-Pond_Effect_and_Combined_Model_for_Mathematics_and_Science","232549938_A_Multifaceted_Academic_Self-Concept_Its_Hierarchical_Structure_and_its_Relation_to_Academic_Achievement","230599167_What_We_Should_Expect_From_Theories_in_Social_Psychology_Truth_Abstraction_Progress_and_Applicability_As_Standards_TAPAS","10641208_Comparison_Processes_in_Social_Judgment_Mechanisms_and_Consequences","290486487_Exploring_the_source_of_self-regulated_learning_The_influence_of_internal_and_external_comparisons","288041107_Dimensional_comparisons_in_students'_perceptions_of_the_learning_environment","273311730_The_InternalExternal_Frame_of_Reference_Model_of_Self-Concept_and_Achievement_Relations_Age-Cohort_and_Cross-Cultural_Differences","272365165_Contrast_and_Assimilation_Effects_of_Dimensional_Comparisons_in_Five_Subjects_An_Extension_of_the_IE_Model","270187343_The_Logic_of_Scientific_Discovery","266320742_Dimensional_Comparison_Theory_Paradoxical_relations_between_self-beliefs_and_achievements_in_multiple_domains","265090141_Impact_of_Social_and_Dimensional_Comparisons_on_Student's_Mathematical_and_English_Subject-Interest_at_the_Beginning_of_Secondary_School","248914070_Gender_and_course_selection_in_upper_secondary_education_Effects_of_academic_self-concept_and_intrinsic_value","240218167_Zum_Zusammenhang_von_Leistungen_undSelbstkonzepten_in_verschiedenen_Sportarten","236095708_Dimensional_Comparison_Theory","232583700_Temporal_comparison_theory","232500301_Dimensional_comparisons_An_experimental_approach_to_the_InternalExternal_frame_of_reference_model","232494267_On_the_Benefit_of_Dimensional_Comparisons","232472383_Internal_Comparisons_in_Everyday_Life","226697507_Not_Very_Smart_thus_Moral_Dimensional_Comparisons_Between_Academic_Self-Concept_and_Honesty","225396726_An_extension_to_the_internalexternal_frame_of_reference_model_to_two_verbal_and_numerical_domains","223690091_Antecedents_of_academic_emotions_Testing_the_internalexternal_frame_of_reference_model_for_academic_enjoyment","222562956_Teachers'_inferences_about_students'_self-concepts_-_the_role_of_dimensional_comparison","200772575_A_Theory_of_Social_Comparison_Processes","200772470_Verbal_and_Math_Self-Concepts_An_InternalExternal_Frame_of_Reference_Model","32222228_Verbal_Mathematics_and_Physical_Education_Self-Concepts_and_Achievements_An_Extension_and_Test_of_the_InternalExternal_Frame_of_Reference_Model","12694616_A_Motivated_Exploration_of_Motivation_Terminology","12058829_Frame_of_Reference_Effects_Following_the_Announcement_of_Exam_Results","7710927_Paradoxical_effects_of_praise_and_criticism_Social_dimensional_and_temporal_comparisons","7449656_Coursework_selection_A_frame_of_reference_approach_using_structural_equation_modelling","7205423_The_Belief_in_a_Negative_Interdependence_of_Math_and_Verbal_Abilities_as_Determinant_of_Academic_Self-Concepts"]}
