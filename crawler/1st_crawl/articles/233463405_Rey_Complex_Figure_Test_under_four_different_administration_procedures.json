{"id":"233463405_Rey_Complex_Figure_Test_under_four_different_administration_procedures","abstract":"This study was undertaken to identify the relationship between the raw scores obtained on the Rey Complex Figure Test (CFT) under four different administration procedures; additionally, the effects of the administration procedures on the Recognition Trial (Meyers & Meyers, 1994) were examined. The Recognition Trial is a new instrument, developed to assess recognition of various parts of the CFT. Many authors have presented a variety of administration procedures; however, there are no studies that examine the relationship of the various administration procedures. The administration procedures used were as follows: (1) Copy, Immediate recall, 30-min recall, and Recognition Trial; (2) Copy, 3-min recall, 30-min recall, Recognition Trial; (3) Copy, Immediate recall, 3-min recall, 30-min recall, Recognition Trial; (4) Copy, 30-min recall, Recognition Trial. The results of the study indicate no significant difference in the 30-min recall score or on the Recognition Trial if an immediate/short-term recall was given; however, if no immediate/short-term recall was given, there was a difference in the 30-min recall score and the Recognition Trial. There was no significant difference in a time period from immediate to 3 min on the 30-min recall score.","authors":["John E Meyers","Kelly R.
