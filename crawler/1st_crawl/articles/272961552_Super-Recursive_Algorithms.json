{"id":"272961552_Super-Recursive_Algorithms","abstract":"All approaches to high performance computing is naturally divided into three main directions: development of computational elements and their networks, advancement of computational methods and procedures, and evolution of the computed structures. In the paper the second direction is developed in the context of the theory of super-recursive algorithms. It is demonstrated that such super-recursive algorithms as inductive Turing machines are more adequate for simulating many processes, have much more computing power, and are more efficient than recursive algorithms.","authors":["Mark Burgin"],"meta":["June 2004Theoretical Computer Science 317(1-3):1-11","DOI:10.1016/S0304-3975(03)00628-5"],"references":["289920715_Noise_physics_and_non-Turing_computation","267207761_CONTINUITY_AND_CONNECTEDNESS_IN_DISCONTINUOUS_TOPOLOGY","346815634_Can_Digital_Computers_Think_1951","337609879_Russian_Academy_of_Sciences","313649668_The_General_and_Logical_Theory_of_Automata_The_Hixon_Symposium","302353806_End-Running_Human_Intelligence","302214300_Effective_operations_and_functionals_computable_in_the_limit","288348733_Fuzzy_Algorithm-Information_and_Control","288253387_Linear_bounded_automata","288029237_An_alternative_concept_of_computability","285977610_What_is_Complexity_Remarks_on_simpicity_and_complexity_by_the_Nobel_Prizewinning_author_of_The_Quark_and_the_Jaguar","285520249_The_physical_Church_thesis_and_physical_computational_complexity","285368638_Inductive_Turing_machines","284117636_Systolic_arrays_for_VLSI_Sparse_Matrix_proc_1978","280939851_The_Innovation_Algorithm_TRIZ_Systematic_Innovation_and_Technical_Creativity","279701513_The_Emperor's_New_Tests","277298486_A_Preliminary_Report_on_a_General_Theory_of_Inductive_Inference","275785136_Tasks_Super-Tasks_and_the_Modern_Eleatics","270819385_Computation_and_Human_Experience","269028243_Turing's_oracle_From_absolute_to_relative_computability_-_and_back","268854986_Algorithms_and_algorithmic_problems","268736601_Programmation_et_theories_des_categories","268735713_Sequential_Machines_and_Automata_Theory","268734105_The_theory_of_hierarchies","268716846_The_arithmetical_hierarchy_and_inductive_Turing_machines","268709945_Algorithms_and_recursive_functions","268681926_Inductively_defined_sets_of_natural_numbers","268652887_On_the_Definition_of_Computable_Functionals","268612530_Algorithmic_Procedures_Generalized_Turing_Algorithms_and_Elementary_Recursion_Theory","268609752_Membrane_Computing_An_Introduction","268541475_Multi-tape_and_infinite-state_automata_-_A_survey","268497765_Mathematical_logic_Constructive_and_non-constructive_operations","268493389_The_Collected_Works_of_J_Richard_Buchi","268489905_Superminds_People_Harness_Hypercomputation_and_More","268322145_Proving_Church's_Thesis","268243743_Theory_of_Formal_System","268166375_Extension_de_la_notion_de_fonction_recursive_aux_fonctions_d'une_ou_plusieurs_variables_reelles_II_III","267445151_Finite_automata_Behavior_and_synthesis","267113194_On_minimal_realizations_of_behavior_maps_in_categorial_automata_theory","267108596_Second_Thoughts_about_Church's_Thesis_and_Mathematical_Proofs","267086703_Some_Classes_of_Recursive_Functions","267076797_Various_measures_of_complexity_for_finite_objects_axiomatic_description","267069750_Application_of_Recursive_Arithmetic_to_the_Problem_of_Circuit_Synthesis","267056650_Foundations_of_Set_Theory","267055891_The_Complexity_of_Computing","267051262_Computability_in_homogeneous_structures","267014268_Functional_equivalence_of_operators_and_parallel_computation","266985929_An_algebraic_treatment_of_flow_diagrams_and_its_application_to_generalized_recursion_theory","266553581_Automaten_und_Funktoren","266531409_An_argument_against_the_plausibility_of_Church's_thesis","266522781_Communication_Complexity_and_Parallel_Computing","266515478_Complexity_and_approximation_Combinatorial_optimization_problems_and_their_approximability_properties_Incl_1_CD-ROM","266513076_On_computable_sequences","266508126_Universal_limit_Turing_machines","266416020_Building_Infinite_Machines"]}
