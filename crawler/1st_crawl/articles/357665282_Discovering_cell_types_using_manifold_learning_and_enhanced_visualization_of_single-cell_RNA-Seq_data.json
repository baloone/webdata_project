{"id":"357665282_Discovering_cell_types_using_manifold_learning_and_enhanced_visualization_of_single-cell_RNA-Seq_data","abstract":"Identifying relevant disease modules such as target cell types is a significant step for studying diseases. High-throughput single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-seq) technologies have advanced in recent years, enabling researchers to investigate cells individually and understand their biological mechanisms. Computational techniques such as clustering, are the most suitable approach in scRNA-seq data analysis when the cell types have not been well-characterized. These techniques can be used to identify a group of genes that belong to a specific cell type based on their similar gene expression patterns. However, due to the sparsity and high-dimensionality of scRNA-seq data, classical clustering methods are not efficient. Therefore, the use of non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques to improve clustering results is crucial. We introduce a method that is used to identify representative clusters of different cell types by combining non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques and clustering algorithms. We assess the impact of different dimensionality reduction techniques combined with the clustering of thirteen publicly available scRNA-seq datasets of different tissues, sizes, and technologies. We further performed gene set enrichment analysis to evaluate the proposed methodâ€™s performance. As such, our results show that modified locally linear embedding combined with independent component analysis yields overall the best performance relative to the existing unsupervised methods across different datasets.","authors":["Akram Vasighizaker","Saiteja Danda","Luis Rueda"],"meta":["January 2022Scientific Reports 12(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-021-03613-0"],"references":["349099949_Transcriptomic_profiling_of_SARS-CoV-2_infected_human_cell_lines_identifies_HSP90_as_target_for_COVID-19_therapy","340097343_Dimension_Reduction_and_Clustering_Models_for_Single-Cell_RNA_Sequencing_Data_A_Comparative_Study","333883979_Current_best_practices_in_single-cell_RNA-seq_analysis_a_tutorial","331759067_Recurrent_herpes_simplex_virus-1_infection_induces_hallmarks_of_neurodegeneration_and_cognitive_deficits_in_mice","329381074_Dimensionality_reduction_for_visualizing_single-cell_data_using_UMAP","326867979_Single-cell_RNA_sequencing_technologies_and_bioinformatics_pipelines","322973402_SCANPY_Large-scale_single-cell_gene_expression_data_analysis","330218138_Challenges_in_unsupervised_clustering_of_single-cell_RNA-seq_data","329323892_Comprehensive_review_of_the_identification_of_essential_genes_using_computational_methods_focusing_on_feature_implementation_and_assessment","317073300_Adaptive_community_detection_in_complex_networks_using_genetic_algorithms"]}
