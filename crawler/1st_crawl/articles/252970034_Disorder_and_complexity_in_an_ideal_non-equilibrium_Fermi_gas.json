{"id":"252970034_Disorder_and_complexity_in_an_ideal_non-equilibrium_Fermi_gas","abstract":"A model of a non-equilibrium ideal Fermi gas has been devised which is simple enough to be treated analytically. Its properties are compared with a matching equilibrium gas and functions for \"disorder\" and \"complexity\" are defined and evaluated. The non-equilibrium entropy increases with \"order\" up to a certain particle number. Beyond this, the system reverts to the more usual behaviour of entropy increasing with \"disorder\". But this tendency is only slight in this model. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.","authors":["P. T.
