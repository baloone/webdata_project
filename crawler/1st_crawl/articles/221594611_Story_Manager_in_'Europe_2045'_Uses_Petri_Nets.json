{"id":"221594611_Story_Manager_in_'Europe_2045'_Uses_Petri_Nets","abstract":"Europe 2045 is an on-line multi-player strategy game aimed at education of high-school students in economics, politics, and media studies. The essential feature of the game is that players face various simulated scenarios and crises addressing contemporary key issues of the unified Europe. These scenarios are branching and can evolve in a parallel manner. In this paper, we present a technique for specifying plots of these scenarios, which underpins the story manager of Europe 2045. The technique is based on a modification of Petri Nets. We also detail one particular scenario concerning the current crisis in Darfur. On a general level this paper discusses the strengths and weaknesses of implementation of Petri Nets in virtual storytelling.","authors":["Cyril Brom","VÃ­t Sisler","Tomas Holan"],"meta":["December 2007","DOI:10.1007/978-3-540-77039-8_4","SourceDBLP","Conference: Virtual Storytelling.
