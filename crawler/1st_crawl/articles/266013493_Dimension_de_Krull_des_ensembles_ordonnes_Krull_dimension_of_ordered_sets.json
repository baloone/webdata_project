{"id":"266013493_Dimension_de_Krull_des_ensembles_ordonnes_Krull_dimension_of_ordered_sets","abstract":"The notion of deviation of an ordered set has been introduced by Gabriel as a tool to classify rings. It measures how far a given ordered set P deviates from ordered sets satisfying the descending chain condition. We consider here a more general notion and, according to Robson, we define the Krull dimension of P as the deviation of the collection of its final segments ordered by inclusion. Using a generalization of the partition theorem of Ord√∂s, Dushnik and Miller, due to Milner and Pouzet, we show that the Krull dimension of P is the maximum of the Krull dimension of its linear extensions.","authors":["Maurice Pouzet","Nejib Zaguia"],"meta":["March 1985Discrete Mathematics 53(1)","DOI:10.1016/0012-365X(85)90141-4","Sourcedx.doi.org"],"references":["266242118_Ordered_Sets","269005046_On_Fraisse's_Order_Type_Conjecture","266280652_Sur_la_dimension_des_anneaux_et_ensembles_ordonnes","266198134_Chaines_d'ideaux_et_de_sections_initiales_d'un_ensemble_ordonne_These","265959978_Extension_et_stratification_d'ensembles_disperses","265889255_Partially_well_ordered_sets_and_partial_ordinals","240924567_Well-partial_orderings_and_hierarchies","238858404_Well_quasi-ordered_sets_and_ideals_in_free_semigroups_and_algebras","238717639_Ordering_by_Divisibility_in_Abstract_Algebras","230595922_Partially_Ordered_Sets","227147202_The_erds-dushnik-miller_theorem_for_topological_graphs_and_orders","223058900_The_Theory_of_Well-Quasi-Ordering_A_Frequently_Discovered_Concept","36233784_Des_Categories_Abeliennes"]}
