{"id":"272852670_The_Study_on_Agricultural_Machinery_Design_and_Modeling_Method","abstract":"The analysis of the design characteristics of agricultural machinery and parts of the present situation of the current model libraries and shortages, and puts forward some network virtual library system of agricultural machinery to model the meaning of design, and probes into the concrete structure and implementation of the system route. For farm machinery design, interactive technology, the model base techniques are studied, the integrated use of Cult3D technology, three-dimensional modeling software, dynamic web technology and database technology developed for farm machinery design network virtual model library system. To engine as an example, this paper introduces the model, interactive event set to create and database technology.","authors":["Liu Jianjun"],"meta":["December 2012International Journal of Advancements in Computing Technology 4(22):678-684","DOI:10.4156/ijact.vol4.issue22.78"],"references":["222990366_Haptic_technologies_for_the_conceptual_and_validation_phases_of_product_design","2612165_Direct_Manipulation_of_Free-Form_Deformations","290868485_Predictive_robust_control_for_electro-hydraulic_control_force_loading_system","289543239_A_lateral_tracking_based_phase_zero_estimation_method_for_ultrasonic_elastography","276008123_Research_on_a_Divide-and-conquer_Algorithm_for_Constructing_Concept_Lattice","260067249_Robust_Force_Control_of_a_6-Link_Electro-Hydraulic_Manipulator","245373126_Nonlinear_ForcePressure_Tracking_of_an_Electro-Hydraulic_Actuator","223914839_Dexel-based_force-torque_rendering_and_volume_updating_for_5-DOF_haptic_product_prototyping_and_virtual_sculpting","220594098_Incorporating_free-form_features_in_aesthetic_and_engineering_product_design_State-of-the-art_report","3208468_Providing_Force_Feedback_in_Virtual_Environments"]}
