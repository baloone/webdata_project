{"id":"290602643_Studying_the_Advancement_in_Debugging_Practice_of_Professional_Software_Developers","abstract":"In 1997, Henry Lieberman stated that debugging is the dirty little secret of computer science. Since then, several promising debugging technologies have been developed such as back-in-time debuggers and automatic fault localization methods. However, the last study about the state-of-the-art in debugging is still more than 15 years old and so it is not clear whether these new approaches have been applied in practice or not.\nFor that reason, we investigate the current state of debugging\nin a comprehensive study. First, we review the available literature and learn about current approaches and study results. Second, we observe several professional developers while debugging and interview them about their experiences. Third, we create a questionnaire that serves as the basis for a larger online debugging survey. Based on these results, we present new insights into debugging practice that help to suggest new directions for future research.","authors":["Michael Perscheid","Benjamin Siegmund","Marcel Taeumel","Robert Hirschfeld"],"meta":["March 2017Software Quality Journal 25(1)","DOI:10.1007/s11219-015-9294-2"],"references":["257941946_Test-driven_Fault_Navigation_for_Debugging_Reproducible_Failures","234830615_Software_debugging_testing_and_verification","287334535_SOBER","286614996_Debugging_by_Thinking_A_Multidisciplinary_Approach","285055290_Debugging","281345584_On_the_Criterion_that_a_Given_System_of_Deviations_from_the_Probable_in_the_Case_of_a_Correlated_System_of_Variables_is_Such_that_it_Can_Be_Reasonably_Supposed_to_have_Arisen_from_Random_Sampling","268289038_A_Survey_of_Software_Fault_Localization","258138380_An_Exploratory_Study_of_Computer_Program_Debugging","242460971_X_On_the_criterion_that_a_given_system_of_deviations_from_the_probable_in_the_case_of_a_correlated_system_of_variables_is_such_that_it_can_be_reasonably_supposed_to_have_arisen_from_random_sampling","240599135_Note_on_Regression_and_Inheritance_in_the_Case_of_Two_Parents","234816978_Debugging_The_good_the_bad_and_the_quirky_-a_qualitative_analysis_of_novices'_strategies","232815273_Test-driven_Fault_Navigation_for_Debugging_Reproducible_Failures","234783806_Why_Sally_and_Joey_can't_debug_next_generation_tools_and_the_perils_they_pose","224264672_Adaptive_bug_isolation","223474955_Expertise_in_debugging_computer_programs_A_process_analysis"]}
