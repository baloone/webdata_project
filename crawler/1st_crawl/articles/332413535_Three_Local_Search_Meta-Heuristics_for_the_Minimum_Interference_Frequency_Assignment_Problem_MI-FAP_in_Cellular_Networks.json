{"id":"332413535_Three_Local_Search_Meta-Heuristics_for_the_Minimum_Interference_Frequency_Assignment_Problem_MI-FAP_in_Cellular_Networks","abstract":"The minimum interference frequency assignment problem (MI-FAP) plays an important role in cellular networks. MI-FAP is the problem of finding an assignment of a small number of frequencies to a large number of transceivers (TRXs) that minimizes the interferences level. The MI-FAP is known to be NP-Hard, thus it cannot be solved in polynomial time. To remedy this, researchers usually use meta-heuristic techniques to find an approximate solution in reasonable time. Here, the authors propose three meta-heuristics for the MI-FAP: a variable neighborhood search (VNS) and a stochastic local search (SLS) that are combined to obtain a third and a new one, which is called VNS-SLS. The SLS method is incorporated into the VNS process as a subroutine in order to enhance the solution quality. All three proposed methods are evaluated on some well-known datasets to measure their performance. The empirical experiments show that the proposed method VNS-SLS succeeds in finding good results compared to both VNS and SLS confirming a good balance between intensification and diversification.","authors":["Yasmine Lahsinat","Dalila Boughaci","Belaid Benhamou"],"meta":["July 2019International Journal of Applied Metaheuristic Computing 10(3)","DOI:10.4018/IJAMC.2019070107"],"references":["312004652_Scalable_Differential_Evolutionary_Clustering_Algorithm_for_Big_Data_Using_Map-Reduce_Paradigm","273398167_Path_relinking_for_the_fixed_spectrum_frequency_assignment_problem","318019044_A_Hybrid_Particle_Swarm_Optimization_Method_for_Traveling_Salesman_Problem","313896232_Hybrid_WrapperFilter_Gene_Selection_Using_an_Ensemble_of_Classifiers_and_PSO_Algorithm","313021694_Harmony_Search_Based_Algorithms_for_the_Minimum_Interference_Frequency_Assignment_Problem","305628401_Using_a_Bio-Inspired_Algorithm_to_Resolve_the_Multiple_Sequence_Alignment_Problem","277022517_Hybridizing_Artificial_Bee_Colony_Algorithm_with_Multi-Parent_Crossover_Operator","262247949_Scheduling_Cellular_Manufacturing_Systems_Using_ACO_and_GA","261853697_Variable_neighborhood_search_for_the_P-median","248745229_Frequency_planning_with_respect_to_interference_minimization_in_cellular_radio_networks"]}
