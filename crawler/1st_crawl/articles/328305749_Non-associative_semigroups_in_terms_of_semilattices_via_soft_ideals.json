{"id":"328305749_Non-associative_semigroups_in_terms_of_semilattices_via_soft_ideals","abstract":"An AG-groupoid can be referred to as a non-associative semigroup, as the main difference between a semigroup and an AG-groupoid is the switching of an associative law. In this paper, we define the smallest one-sided ideals in an AG-groupoid and use them to characterize a strongly regular class of a unitary AG-groupoid along with its semilattices and SI-l-ideals (SI-r-ideals) and SI-bi-ideals. As an application, we get some interesting and new characterizations which we usually do not find in semigroups. Finally we give the concept of an AG ***-groupoid and give an example to show that this class is the generalization of a unitary AG-groupoid.","authors":["Faisal Yousafzai","Arshad Ali","Shamsul Haq","Kostaq Hila"],"meta":["October 2018Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems","DOI:10.3233/JIFS-18873"],"references":["333446253_A_Study_of_Non-Associative_Ordered_Semigroups_in_Terms_of_Semilattices_via_Smallest_Double-Framed_Soft_Ideals","331101281_CONGRUENCES_AND_DECOMPOSITIONS_OF_AG-GROUPOIDS","327905098_Congruences_and_decompositions_of_AG-groupoids","327391131_A_Study_of_Ordered_Ag-Groupoids_in_terms_of_Semilattices_via_Smallest_Fuzzy_Ideals","327139727_Non-associative_ordered_semigroups_based_on_soft_sets","324826999_Sandwich_sets_and_congruences_in_completely_inverse_ag-groupoids","267122202_Congruences_on_completely_inverse_AG-groupoids","320007561_Soft_bckbci-algebras","285328306_Soft_sets_technique_and_its_application","268654447_On_locally_associative_LA-semigroups"]}
