{"id":"277603181_Boundary_Integral_Equations_for_the_Transmission_Eigenvalue_Problem_for_Maxwell_Equations","abstract":"In this paper we consider the transmission eigenvalue problem for Maxwell's\nequations corresponding to non-magnetic inhomogeneities with contrast in\nelectric permittivity that changes sign inside its support. We formulate the\ntransmission eigenvalue problem as an equivalent homogeneous system of boundary\nintegral equation, and assuming that the contrast is constant near the boundary\nof the support of the inhomogeneity, we prove that the operator associated with\nthis system is Fredholm of index zero and depends analytically on the wave\nnumber. Then we show the existence of wave numbers that are not transmission\neigenvalues which by an application of the analytic Fredholm theory implies\nthat the set of transmission eigenvalues is discrete with positive infinity as\nthe only accumulation point.","authors":["Fioralba Cakoni","Houssem Haddar","Shixu Meng"],"meta":["June 2015Journal of Integral Equations and Applications 27(3)","DOI:10.1216/JIE-2015-27-3-375","SourcearXiv"],"references":["265635031_Transmission_Eigenvalues_in_Inverse_Scattering_Theory","265242250_The_Linear_Sampling_Method_in_Inverse_Electromagnetic_Scattering","258275587_A_numerical_method_to_compute_interior_transmission_eigenvalues","316807526_The_Mathematical_Theory_of_Time-Harmonic_Maxwell's_Equations","281262970_On_the_existence_of_transmission_eigenvalues","267678259_Surface_integral_formulation_of_the_interior_transmission_problem","267434648_A_Qualitative_Approach_to_Inverse_Scattering_Theory","266321614_Spectral_properties_of_the_exterior_transmission_eigenvalue_problem","264823397_On_the_interior_transmission_eigenvalue_problem","261992919_Linear_Integral_Equations"]}
