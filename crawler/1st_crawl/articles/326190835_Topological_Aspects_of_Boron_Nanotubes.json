{"id":"326190835_Topological_Aspects_of_Boron_Nanotubes","abstract":"The degree-based topological indices are used to correlate the physical and chemical properties of a molecule with its chemical structure. Boron nanotubular structures are high-interest materials due to the presence of multicenter bonds and have novel electronic properties. These materials have some important issues in nanodevice applications like mechanical and thermal stability. Therefore, they require theoretical studies on the other properties. In this paper, we present certain degree-based topological indices such as ABC, the fourth ABC, GA, and the fifth GA indices for boron triangular and boron-Î± nanotubes.","authors":["Jia-Bao Liu","Hani Shaker","Imran Nadeem","Muhammad Hussain"],"meta":["July 2018Advances in Materials Science and Engineering 2018(5729291)","DOI:10.1155/2018/5729291"],"references":["304330792_On_Eccentric_Connectivity_Index_of_TiO2_Nanotubes","285323419_Geometrical_and_thermodynamic_approaches_to_the_relative_stabilities_of_fullerene_isomers","283159084_On_atom-bond_connectivity_index_and_its_chemical_applicability","286873729_Mathematical_chemistry","285853391_Computing_ABC4_index_of_nanostar_dendrimers","285842416_Computing_fifth_geometric-arithmetic_index_for_nanostar_dendrimers","282563330_Complete_characterization_of_bicyclic_graphs_with_minimal_Kirchhoff_index","281993886_An_atom-bond_connectivity_index_Modelling_the_enthalpy_of_formation_of_alkanes","268670797_Recent_Results_in_the_Theory_of_Randic_Index","267141066_On_Geometric-Arithmetic_Index_of_Graphs"]}
