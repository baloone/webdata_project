{"id":"322147621_Pragmatic_Evaluation_of_IScrum_Scrum","abstract":"Scrum has emerged as a most adopted and most desired Agile approach that provides corporate strategic competency by laying a firm foundation for project management. Scrum, being more of a framework than a rigid methodology, offers maximum flexibility to its practitioners. However, there are several challenges confronted during its implementation for which certain researchers not only adapted, but also augmented Scrum with other Agile practices. One such effort is IScrum, an Improved Scrum process model. In this paper an empirical study has been conducted for analyzing the two models i.e. classical Agile Scrum model and IScrum process model. There are two goals of this study: first is to validate the IScrum and the second goal is to evaluate it in comparison with the traditional Scrum model. Subsequently, the study will describe and highlight which characteristics of Scrum are enhanced in IScrum. Furthermore, a survey is used to investigate the teams' experience with both models. The results of survey and case-study have been examined and compared to find out if IScrum performs well than Scrum in software development. The outcomes advocate that the improvements were quite effective in resolving most of the problem areas. The IScrum can thus be adopted by industry practitioners as best choice.","authors":["Sara Ashraf","Shabib Aftab"],"meta":["January 2018International Journal of Modern Education and Computer Science 10(1):24-35","DOI:10.5815/ijmecs.2018.01.03","Project: Agile software process models"],"references":["320892291_Scrum_with_the_Spices_of_Agile_Family_A_Systematic_Mapping","318862358_IScrum_An_Improved_Scrum_Process_Model","318085521_Latest_Transformations_in_Scrum_A_State_of_the_Art_Review","316845761_Comparative_Analysis_of_Two_Popular_Agile_Process_Models_Extreme_Programming_and_Scrum","311775064_A_Hybrid_Agile_model_using_SCRUM_and_Feature_Driven_Development","316504865_An_empirical_study_and_a_framework_for_effective_risk_management_in_scrum","315606930_Scrum_Hero_Gamifying_the_Scrum_Framework","313869320_Applying_usability_testing_to_improving_Scrum_methodology_in_develop_assistant_information_system","312559552_A_comprehensive_study_on_state_of_Scrum_development","310624635_An_experience_in_blending_the_traditional_and_Agile_methodologies_to_assist_in_a_small_software_development_project"]}
