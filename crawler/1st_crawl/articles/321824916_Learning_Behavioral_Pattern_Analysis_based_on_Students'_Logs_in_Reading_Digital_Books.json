{"id":"321824916_Learning_Behavioral_Pattern_Analysis_based_on_Students'_Logs_in_Reading_Digital_Books","abstract":"In this paper, we presented a study developing a digital textbook system, which could be used anywhere, anytime. An experiment was conducted using the developed system to collect students' learning logs for analyzing their behavioral patterns on an Educational Technology course for graduate students. In the experiment, we assigned the students to read an academic English journal article. The lag-sequential analysis method was employed to analyze and infer their behavioral patterns. Several interesting behavioral patterns were found from the analysis results. The findings are helpful to the improvement of the digital textbook system; moreover, some behavioral patterns could provide helpful references for teachers to improve teaching materials in the future.","authors":["Chengjiu Yin","Noriko Uosaki","Hui-Chun Chu","Gwo-Jen Hwang"],"meta":["December 2017","Conference: The 25th International Conference on Computers in Education (ICCE 2017)"],"references":["321122363_E-Book-Based_Learning_Analytics_for_Improving_Learning_Materials","312866584_Improving_Teaching_Materials_through_Digital_Book_Reading_Log","288968039_The_Rise_of_E-Reading","285149839_Analyzing_the_Features_of_Learning_Behaviors_of_Students_using_e-Books","273660310_Research_Trends_with_Cross_Tabulation_Search_Engine","315316944_Automatic_Summarization_of_Lecture_Slides_for_Enhanced_Student_Preview_-Technical_Report_and_User_Study-","311161817_Interaction_of_problem-based_gaming_and_learning_anxiety_in_language_students'_English_listening_performance_and_progressive_behavioral_patterns","291990550_Literacy_and_assistive_technology_for_children_with_special_needs","283969578_Me_and_my_hypertext_A_multiple_digression_analysis_of_technology_and_literacy_sic","271753674_Exploring_the_role_of_flow_experience_learning_performance_and_potential_behavior_clusters_in_elementary_students'_game-based_learning"]}
