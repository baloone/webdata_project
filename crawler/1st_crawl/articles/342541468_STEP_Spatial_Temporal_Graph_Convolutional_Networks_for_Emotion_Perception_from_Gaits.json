{"id":"342541468_STEP_Spatial_Temporal_Graph_Convolutional_Networks_for_Emotion_Perception_from_Gaits","abstract":"We present a novel classifier network called STEP, to classify perceived human emotion from gaits, based on a Spatial Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (ST-GCN) architecture. Given an RGB video of an individual walking, our formulation implicitly exploits the gait features to classify the perceived emotion of the human into one of four emotions: happy, sad, angry, or neutral. We train STEP on annotated real-world gait videos, augmented with annotated synthetic gaits generated using a novel generative network called STEP-Gen, built on an ST-GCN based Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE). We incorporate a novel push-pull regularization loss in the CVAE formulation of STEP-Gen to generate realistic gaits and improve the classification accuracy of STEP. We also release a novel dataset (E-Gait), which consists of 4,227 human gaits annotated with perceived emotions along with thousands of synthetic gaits. In practice, STEP can learn the affective features and exhibits classification accuracy of 88% on E-Gait, which is 14â€“30% more accurate over prior methods.","authors":["Uttaran Bhattacharya","Trisha Mittal","Rohan Chandra","Tanmay Randhavane"],"meta":["April 2020Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence 34(02):1342-1350","DOI:10.1609/aaai.v34i02.5490"],"references":["322675136_Spatial_Temporal_Graph_Convolutional_Networks_for_Skeleton-Based_Action_Recognition","321307210_Deep_Video_Generation_Prediction_and_Completion_of_Human_Action_Sequences","346778668_Take_an_Emotion_Walk_Perceiving_Emotions_from_Gaits_Using_Hierarchical_Attention_Pooling_and_Affective_Mapping","332816745_A_Recurrent_Variational_Autoencoder_for_Human_Motion_Synthesis","329750832_Joint_Pose_and_Expression_Modeling_for_Facial_Expression_Recognition","329748381_Facial_Expression_Recognition_by_De-expression_Residue_Learning","329740448_MoCoGAN_Decomposing_Motion_and_Content_for_Video_Generation","328370200_Emotion_Recognition_in_Speech_using_Cross-Modal_Transfer_in_the_Wild","322076361_Detect-and-Track_Efficient_Pose_Estimation_in_Videos","321994371_Emotion_Recognition_using_Wireless_Signals"]}
