{"id":"341567132_Coding_Math_Strengthen_K-5_Math_Skills_With_Computer_Science","abstract":"How-to books related to computer science (CS) and teaching CS in K-12 environments are often either step-by-step guides or reference books, with little or no connection to pedagogy. By contrast, Coding + Math offers the analytical foundation teachers need to inform their practice, specifically in mathematics.\n\nThis book will serve as a deep dive into CS integration for elementary teachers, providing guidelines for designing integrated CS/math curricula through case studies and practical examples. Grounded in research, the bookâ€™s mini-lessons contrast visual-based coding with text-based programming and provide guidance in the selection and creation of lessons, instructional materials and CS platforms to help educators prepare students for the careers of the future.","authors":["Nicol R Howard","Keith Howard"],"meta":["May 2020","Publisher: International Society for Technology in EducationISBN: 9781564848253","Project: STEM and CS Equity"],"references":[]}
