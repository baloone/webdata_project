{"id":"332382417_Coherent_Interaction_Graphs","abstract":"We introduce the notion of coherent graphs, and show how those can be used to define dynamic semantics for Multiplicative Linear Logic (MLL) extended with non-determinism. Thanks to the use of a coherence relation rather than mere formal sums of non-deterministic possibilities, our model enjoys some finiteness and sparsity properties.\n\nWe also show how studying the semantic types generated by a single \"test\" within our model of MLL naturally gives rise to a notion of proof net, which turns out to be exactly Retoré's R&B-cographs. This revisits the old idea that multplicative proof net correctness is interactive, with a twist: types are characterized not by a set of counter-proofs but by a single non-deterministic counter-proof.","authors":["Lê Thành Dũng Nguyen","Thomas Seiller"],"meta":["April 2019","DOI:10.4204/EPTCS.292.6"],"references":["320818376_Proof-Nets_the_parallel_syntax_for_proof-theory","309172531_Conflict_nets_Efficient_locally_canonical_MALL_proof_nets","303821965_An_introduction_to_Differential_Linear_Logic_proof-nets_models_and_antiderivatives","302900160_On_the_computational_meaning_of_axioms","268165231_Towards_a_Geometry_of_Interaction","266718782_Multiplicatives","266659011_A_new_correctness_criterion_for_MLL_proof_nets","262641249_Interaction_Graphs_Graphings","256416881_Complement_reducible_graphs","243772753_Coherence_for_compact_closed_categories"]}
