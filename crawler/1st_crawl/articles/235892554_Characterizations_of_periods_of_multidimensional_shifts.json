{"id":"235892554_Characterizations_of_periods_of_multidimensional_shifts","abstract":"We show that the sets of periods of multidimensional shifts of finite type\n(SFTs) are exactly the sets of integers of the complexity class $\\NE$. We also\nshow that the functions counting their number are the functions of #E. We also\ngive characterizations of some other notions of periodicity. We finish the\npaper by giving some characterizations for sofic and effective subshifts.","authors":["Emmanuel Jeandel","Pascal Vanier"],"meta":["March 2013Ergodic Theory and Dynamical Systems 35(02)","DOI:10.1017/etds.2013.60","SourcearXiv"],"references":["257506866_Simulation_of_Effective_Subshifts_by_Two-dimensional_Subshifts_of_Finite_Type","321526021_Structural_Complexity_I","268889540_Multi-dimensional_symbolic_dynamics","266991555_Handbook_of_Theoretical_Computer_Science_Vol_A_Algorithms_and_Complexity","266352345_A_zeta_function_for_Z_d_-actions","265564061_Structural_Complexity_II","262493823_The_Art_of_Computer_Programming","258407363_Developments_in_Language_Theory","245578619_Axel_Thue''s_papers_on_repetitions_in_words_a_translation","242463956_The_Undecidability_of_the_Domino_Problem"]}
