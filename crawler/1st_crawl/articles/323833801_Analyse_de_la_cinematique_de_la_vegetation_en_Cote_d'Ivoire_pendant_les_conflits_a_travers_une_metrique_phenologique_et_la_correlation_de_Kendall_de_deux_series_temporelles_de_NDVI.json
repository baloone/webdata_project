A multiscale and multisatellite remote sensing approach has been set up in order to study vegetation changes, in particular the forest-savanna limit, first over a region including Ivory Coast and Benin with an 8 km resolution, from 1981 to 2006, then over Ivory Coast only, with a 250 m resolution, from 2002 to 2014. Both two NDVI time series (AVHRR et MODIS) has been studied on the one hand with Kendall correlation and on the other hand, with an original metric which enable to distinguish vegetation which photosynthesis presents a unimodal rhythm (one rainy season and one vegetative activity season) or bimodal rhythm (two rainy seasons and two vegetative activity seasons).","authors":["Julien Andrieu"],"meta":["January 2018"],"references":[]}
