{"id":"334385542_North_Atlantic_right_whale_Eubalaena_glacialis_acoustic_behavior_on_the_calving_grounds","abstract":"Passive acoustic monitoring is a common method for detection of endangered North Atlantic right whales. This study reports on the acoustic behavior of right whales on the winter calving grounds to assess their acoustic detectability in this habitat. In addition to known call types, previously undescribed low amplitude short broadband signals were detected from lactating females with calves. The production of higher amplitude tonal calls occurred at lower rates for lactating females than from other age/sex classes suggesting that passive acoustic monitoring may be less effective in detecting mother-calf pairs in this critical habitat area.","authors":["Susan Elizabeth Parks","Dana A Cusano","Sofie Van Parijs","Douglas P Nowacek"],"meta":["July 2019The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America 146(1):EL15-EL21","DOI:10.1121/1.5115332","Project: North Atlantic right whale mother-calf acoustic behaviour"],"references":["328573828_Implementing_conservation_measures_for_the_North_Atlantic_right_whale_considering_the_behavioral_ontogeny_of_mother-calf_pairs","282446507_North_Atlantic_right_whale_occurrence_near_wind_energy_areas_along_the_mid-Atlantic_US_coast_Implications_for_management","278392194_North_Atlantic_right_whale_Eubalaena_glacialis_vocalization_patterns_in_the_central_Gulf_of_Maine_from_October_2009_through_October_2010","271253102_Sound_production_behavior_of_individual_North_Atlantic_right_whales_Implications_for_passive_acoustic_monitoring","271253059_Application_of_a_habitat_model_to_define_calving_habitat_of_the_North_Atlantic_right_whale_in_the_southeastern_United_States","268273193_Vocalisation_rates_of_the_North_Atlantic_right_whale","263454080_Passive_acoustic_monitoring_on_the_North_Atlantic_right_whale_calving_grounds","262112001_Using_accelerometers_to_determine_the_calling_behavior_of_tagged_baleen_whales","261750320_Wintering_Habitat_Model_for_the_North_Atlantic_Right_Whale_Eubalaena_glacialis_in_the_Southeastern_United_States","236124123_Management_and_research_applications_of_real-time_and_archival_acoustic_sensors_over_varying_temporal_and_spatial_scales","49819133_Common_humpback_whale_Megaptera_novaeangliae_sound_types_for_passive_acoustic_monitoring","11824022_Buoyant_balaenids_The_ups_and_downs_of_buoyancy_in_right_whales","7232207_Kinematics_of_diving_and_lunge-feeding_in_fin_whales","5506246_Vocalizations_produced_by_humpback_whale_Megaptera_novaeangliae_calves_recorded_in_Hawaii","334495387_A_lifetime_of_changing_calls_North_Atlantic_right_whales_Eubalaena_glacialis_refine_call_production_as_they_age","284987300_The_use_of_photographs_to_identify_individual_North_Atlantic_right_whales_Eubalaena_glacialis","282940585_Right_whale_occurrence_in_the_coastal_waters_of_Virginia_USA_Endangered_species_presence_in_a_rapidly_developing_energy_market","259695685_Vocalization_characteristics_of_North_Atlantic_right_whale_surface_active_groups_in_the_calving_habitat_southeastern_United_States","229668073_Seasonal_occurrence_of_North_Atlantic_right_whale_Eubalaena_glacialis_vocalizations_at_two_sites_on_the_Scotian_Shelf","7784665_Sound_production_by_North_Atlantic_right_whales_Eubalaena_glacialis_in_surface_active_groups","6317037_Discovery_of_a_low_frequency_sound_source_in_Mysticeti_baleen_whales_Anatomical_establishment_of_a_vocal_fold_homolog","3231925_A_digital_acoutic_recording_tag_for_measuring_the_response_of_wild_marine_mammals_to_sound"]}
