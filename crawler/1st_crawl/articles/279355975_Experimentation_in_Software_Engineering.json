{"id":"279355975_Experimentation_in_Software_Engineering","abstract":"The experiment data from the operation is input to the analysis and interpretation. After collecting experimental data in the operation phase, we want to be able to draw conclusions based on this data. To be able to draw valid conclusions, we must interpret the experiment data.","authors":["Claes Wohlin","Per Runeson","Martin HÃ¶st","Magnus C Ohlsson"],"meta":["May 2012","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-29044-2_10","In book: Experimentation in Software Engineering (pp.123-151)"],"references":["302924724_Guidelines_for_performing_Systematic_Literature_Reviews_in_Software_Engineering","262296732_Why_and_How_Research_Ethics_Matters_to_You_Yes_Youexcl","259240755_Empirical_Investigation_of_Perspective-based_Reading_A_Replicated_Experiment","244551451_Five_Misunderstandings_About_Case-Study_Research","243783609_The_Research_Methods_Knowledge_Base","243765439_The_GoalQuestionMetric_Method_A_Practical_Guide_for_Quality_Improvement_of_Software_Development","242368666_A_Scientific_Methodology_for_MIS_Case_Studies","347256853_Research_Design_for_Social_Work_and_the_Human_Services","336573400_Systematic_Mapping_Studies_in_Software_Engineering","336571917_Using_a_Protocol_Template_for_Case_Study_Planning","336570058_Reference-based_search_strategies_in_systematic_reviews","329850999_A_Critical_Perspective_on_Action_Research_as_a_Method_for_Information_Systems_Research","329702230_Quality_from_customer_needs_to_customer_Satisfaction","316800454_The_Kluwer_International_Series_in_Software_Engineering","313601746_Checklists_for_software_engineering_case_study_research","313601598_Requirements_abstraction_model","312985464_Building_theories_from_case_study_research","312927331_Nonparametric_statistics_for_the_Behavioral_Sciences","309208162_Preliminary_Guidelines_for_Empirical_Research_in_Software_Engineering","301222248_Building_knowledge_through_families_of_experiments","284714260_Evaluating_guidelines_for_reporting_empirical_software_engineering_studies","280940151_Handbook_of_Software_Reliability_Engineering","273097376_Multivariate_Statistical_Methods_A_Primer","272177878_An_Experimental_Application_of_the_DELPHI_Method_to_the_Use_of_Experts","271589480_Qualitative_Methods_in_Empirical_Studies_of_Software_Engineering","271439344_Experimental_context_classification","266385157_Design_Analysis_of_Experiments","260649166_The_TAME_Project_Towards_Improvement-Oriented_Software_Environments","260246082_Case_Study_Research_in_Software_Engineering_--_Guidelines_and_Examples","258967180_Goalquestionmetric_paradigm","247585638_Some_Implementations_of_the_Boxplot","247572568_Software_Metrics_A_Rigorous_and_Pracical_Approach","245712950_Comparing_detection_methods_for_software_requirements_inspections_a_replicated_experiment_using_pro","243781488_Statistical_Analysis_An_Interdisciplinary_Introduction_to_Univariate_Multivariate_Methods","243778060_Capture-Recapture_Estimations_for_Perspective-Based_Reading-A_Simulated_Experiment","243777430_Lab_Package_for_the_Empirical_Investigation_of_Perspective-Based_Reading_Available_at_httpwww","243656721_Experimental_Software_Engineering_Issues_Critical_Assessment_and_Future_Directions","243644720_Design_and_Code_Inspections_To_Reduce_Errors_In_Program_Development","243472565_Practical_Guidelines_for_Measurement-Based_Process_Improvement1","242695491_Quantitative_evaluation_of_software_engineering_methodology","242483183_Developing_techniques_for_using_software_documents_a_series_of_empirical_studies","242401332_Experimental_design_and_analysis_in_software_engineering","242351866_Introduction_to_the_Software_Personal_Software_Process","239548673_Votta_does_every_inspection_need_a_meeting","239542737_The_Case_Research_Strategy_in_Studies_of_Information_Systems","239064948_Quality-from_Customer_Needs_to_Customer_Satisfaction","239059668_Making_Software_Measurement_work-Building_an_Effective_Measurement_Program","238718756_Software_Engineering_-_ESEC_'93_4th_European_Software_Engineering_Conference_Garmisch-Partenkirchen_Germany_September_13-17_1993_Proceedings","238664053_A_Framework_for_Technology_Introduction_in_Software_Organizations1","236896091_Modeling_and_Measuring_Process_Conformance_in_Empirical_Studies_of_Software_Development","233293460_A_Critical_Perspective_on_Action_Research_as_a_Method_for_Information_Systems_Research","236144141_The_art_of_Case_Study_Research","236144127_Case_Survey_Methodology_Quantitative_Analysis_of_Patterns_Across_Case_Studies","235978147_Software_Metrics_Establishing_a_Company-Wide_Program","234818463_Introduction_to_the_personal_software_processsm"]}
