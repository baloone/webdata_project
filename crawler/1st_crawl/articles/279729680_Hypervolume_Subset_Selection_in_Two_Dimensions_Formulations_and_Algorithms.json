{"id":"279729680_Hypervolume_Subset_Selection_in_Two_Dimensions_Formulations_and_Algorithms","abstract":"The hypervolume subset selection problem consists of finding a subset, with a given cardinality k, of a set of nondominated points that maximizes the hypervolume indicator. This problem arises in selection procedures of evolutionary algorithms for multiobjective optimization, for which practically efficient algorithms are required. In this article, two new formulations are provided for the two-dimensional variant of this problem. The first is a (linear) integer programming formulation that can be solved by solving its linear programming relaxation. The second formulation is a k-link shortest path formulation on a special digraph with the Monge property that can be solved by dynamic programming in [Formula: see text] time. This improves upon the result of [Formula: see text] in Bader (2009), and slightly improves upon the recent result of [Formula: see text] in Bringmann et al. (2014b), which was developed independently from this work using different techniques. Numerical results are shown for several values of n and k.","authors":["Tobias Kuhn","Carlos M Fonseca","Luis Paquete","Stefan Ruzika"],"meta":["July 2015Evolutionary Computation 24(1)","DOI:10.1162/EVCO_a_00157","SourcePubMed"],"references":["226196472_Finding_a_minimum-weight_k_-link_path_in_graphs_with_the_concave_Monge_property_and_applications","225313240_Geometric_Applications_of_a_Matrix-Searching_Algorithm","222030993_SMS-EMOA_Multiobjective_selection_based_on_dominated_hypervolume","6418295_Covariance_Matrix_Adaptation_for_Multi-objective_Optimization","4074752_Bounded_archiving_using_the_Lebesgue_measure","4074689_An_evolution_strategy_with_probabilistic_mutation_for_multi-objective_optimisation","3949545_On_metrics_for_comparing_nondominated_sets","2441340_On_the_Assessment_of_Multiobjective_Approaches_to_the_Adaptive_Distributed_Database_Management_Problem","300019912_Generic_Postprocessing_via_Subset_Selection_for_Hypervolume_and_Epsilon-Indicator","290802390_Approximating_the_least_hypervolume_contributor_Np-hard_in_general_but_fast_in_practice_evolutionary_multi-criterion_op-timization_lect","280765002_Measuring_the_quality_of_discrete_representations_of_efficient_sets_in_multiple_objective_mathematical_programming","266656111_Two-dimensional_subset_selection_for_hypervolume_and_epsilon-indicator","262282221_The_Relationship_between_the_Covered_Fraction_Completeness_and_Hypervolume_Indicators","226664743_Approximation_Methods_in_Multiobjective_Programming","221025114_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","216457304_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","216457263_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","210205139_Computing_Hypervolume_Contributions_in_Low_Dimensions_Asymptotically_Optimal_Algorithm_and_Complexity_Results","45280500_HypE_An_Algorithm_for_Fast_Hypervolume-Based_Many-Objective_Optimization","44685406_An_Efficient_Algorithm_for_Computing_Hypervolume_Contributions","12473894_Comparison_of_Multiobjective_Evolutionary_Algorithms_Empirical_Results","3418743_Properties_of_an_adaptive_archiving_algorithm_for_storing_nondominated_vectors","3418737_Performance_Assessment_of_Multiobjective_Optimizers_An_Analysis_and_Review"]}
