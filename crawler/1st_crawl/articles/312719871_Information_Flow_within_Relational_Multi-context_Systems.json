{"id":"312719871_Information_Flow_within_Relational_Multi-context_Systems","abstract":"Multi-context systems (MCSs) are an important framework for heterogeneous combinations of systems within the Semantic Web. In this paper, we propose generic constructions to achieve specific forms of interaction in a principled way, and systematize some useful techniques to work with ontologies within an MCS. All these mechanisms are presented in the form of general-purpose design patterns. Their study also suggests new ways in which this framework can be further extended.","authors":["Luís Cruz-Filipe","Graça Gaspar","Isabel Nunes"],"meta":["November 2014","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-13704-9_8","Conference: International Conference on Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management"],"references":["259150395_Patterns_for_Interfacing_between_Logic_Programs_and_Multiple_Ontologies","230641412_Dynamic_Distributed_Nonmontonic_Multi-Context_Systems","227215903_Ontology_Design_Patterns","226010262_Ontology_Translation_by_Ontology_Merging_and_Automated_Reasoning","225245124_MAFRA_-_A_MApping_FRAmework_for_Distributed_Ontologies","221606644_Knowledge_Integration_for_Description_Logics","221606369_Equilibria_in_Heterogeneous_Nonmonotonic_Multi-Context_Systems","221393549_Distributed_Nonmonotonic_Multi-Context_Systems","221306907_Relational_Information_Exchange_and_Aggregation_in_Multi-Context_Systems","220814330_Managed_Multi-Context_Systems","220813401_A_Uniform_Integration_of_Higher-Order_Reasoning_and_External_Evaluations_in_Answer-Set_Programming","220613524_Well-Founded_Semantics_for_Description_Logic_Programs_in_the_Semantic_Web","285491041_Nonmonotonic_reasoning","267652726_Description_Logics_Rules_and_Multi-context_Systems","265798555_MKNF_Knowledge_Bases_in_Multi-Context_Systems","257482240_Ontology_alignment_design_patterns","251470843_Chapter_6_Nonmonotonic_Reasoning","234801207_Patterns_of_Enterprise_Application_Architecture","227979764_Ontology_Mediation_Merging_and_Aligning","226783443_Functional_Logic_Design_Patterns","224773145_Design_Patterns_Elements_of_Reusable_Object-Oriented_Software","221350723_Patterns_for_Prolog_Programming","221049044_MoA_OWL_Ontology_Merging_and_Alignment_Tool_for_the_Semantic_Web","220566466_A_Tutorial_on_Default_Logics","220547100_A_Logic_for_Default_Reasoning","220430323_Reconciling_Description_Logics_and_Rules"]}
