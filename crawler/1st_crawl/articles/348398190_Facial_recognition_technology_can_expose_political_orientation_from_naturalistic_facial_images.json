{"id":"348398190_Facial_recognition_technology_can_expose_political_orientation_from_naturalistic_facial_images","abstract":"Ubiquitous facial recognition technology can expose individuals’ political orientation, as faces of liberals and conservatives consistently differ. A facial recognition algorithm was applied to naturalistic images of 1,085,795 individuals to predict their political orientation by comparing their similarity to faces of liberal and conservative others. Political orientation was correctly classified in 72% of liberal–conservative face pairs, remarkably better than chance (50%), human accuracy (55%), or one afforded by a 100-item personality questionnaire (66%). Accuracy was similar across countries (the U.S., Canada, and the UK), environments (Facebook and dating websites), and when comparing faces across samples. Accuracy remained high (69%) even when controlling for age, gender, and ethnicity. Given the widespread use of facial recognition, our findings have critical implications for the protection of privacy and civil liberties.","authors":["Michal Kosinski"],"meta":["January 2021Scientific Reports 11(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-020-79310-1"],"references":["341568689_Assessing_the_Big_Five_personality_traits_using_real-life_static_facial_images","325633269_VGGFace2_A_Dataset_for_Recognising_Faces_across_Pose_and_Age","321043573_Psychological_targeting_as_an_effective_approach_to_digital_mass_persuasion","320582621_VGGFace2_A_dataset_for_recognising_faces_across_pose_and_age","318958789_What_your_Facebook_Profile_Picture_Reveals_about_your_Personality","318115578_What_your_Facebook_Profile_Picture_Reveals_about_your_Personality","340391208_Emerging_from_AI_utopia","322871591_Deep_neural_networks_are_more_accurate_than_humans_at_detecting_sexual_orientation_from_facial_images","322371358_Deep_Learning_for_Understanding_Faces_Machines_May_Be_Just_as_Good_or_Better_than_Humans","319121606_AffectNet_A_Database_for_Facial_Expression_Valence_and_Arousal_Computing_in_the_Wild"]}
