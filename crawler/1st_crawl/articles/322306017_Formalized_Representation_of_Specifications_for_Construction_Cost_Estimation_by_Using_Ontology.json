{"id":"322306017_Formalized_Representation_of_Specifications_for_Construction_Cost_Estimation_by_Using_Ontology","abstract":"Construction cost estimation, which is normally labor-intensive and error-prone, is one of the most important works concerned by multiparticipants during a project's life cycle. However, the proficiency of estimators on specifications for construction cost estimation greatly affects the efficiency and accuracy of cost estimation. By formalizing specifications for construction cost estimation , such specifications can be better implemented in computer programs so that the working efficiency and accuracy of estimation can be greatly improved. This study aims to establish an effective approach to formalize such specifications by using ontology. First, two typical specifications for construction cost estimation are analyzed and relevant models are established. Then, an ontology-based representation of two specifications is established based on the models. Next, a prototype tool for facilitating the establishment, modification, and extension of the ontology-based representation for estimators is presented and the use cases of the tool are illustrated. Finally, the applicability of the approach is discussed. It is concluded that the formalized representation can be used to classify the building components into items for bill of quantities and quota items automatically by computer programs to accelerate cost estimation.","authors":["Zhiliang Ma","Zhe Liu","Zhenhua Wei"],"meta":["January 2016","DOI:10.1111/mice.12175"],"references":["254848438_An_Ontology_Web_Language_Notation_of_the_Industry_Foundation_Classes","245283414_SchedulingCost_Optimization_and_Neural_Dynamics_Model_for_Construction","243772462_Ontology_Development_101_A_Guide_to_Creating_Your_First_Ontology","220306622_A_feature_ontology_to_support_construction_cost_estimating","273749877_Ontology-Based_Representation_and_Reasoning_Framework_for_Supporting_Job_Hazard_Analysis","262313008_Ontology_maintenance_in_high_level_architecture_federation_development_and_execution_process","261324096_Framework_of_automatic_construction_cost_estimation_based_on_BIM_and_ontology_technology","261323804_Ontology-based_computerized_representation_of_specifications_for_construction_cost_estimation","259136249_BIM_and_ontology-based_approach_for_building_cost_estimation","257371738_Semi-automatic_and_specification-compliant_cost_estimation_for_tendering_of_building_projects_based_on_IFC_data_of_design_model","245283422_Regularization_Neural_Network_for_Construction_Cost_Estimation","245283357_CONSCOM_An_OO_construction_scheduling_and_change_management_system","245282551_Domain_Taxonomy_for_Construction_Concepts_Toward_a_Formal_Ontology_for_Construction_Knowledge","245282391_Automated_Code_Compliance_Checking_for_Building_Envelope_Design","245136329_Automated_processing_of_construction_specifications_to_support_inspection_and_quality_control","238179268_OO_Information_Model_for_Construction_Project_Management","234950536_A_semantic_rule_checking_environment_for_building_performance_checking","227739364_Object-Oriented_Model_for_Freeway_Work_Zone_Capacity_and_Queue_Delay_Estimation","222620888_Automatic_rule-based_checking_of_building_designs","222606135_An_integrated_computing_environment_for_solution_of_complex_engineering_problems_using_the_object-oriented_programming_paradigm_and_a_blackboard_architecture","221630704_GoodRelations_An_Ontology_for_Describing_Products_and_Services_Offers_on_the_Web"]}
