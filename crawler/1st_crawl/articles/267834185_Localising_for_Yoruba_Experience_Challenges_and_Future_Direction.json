{"id":"267834185_Localising_for_Yoruba_Experience_Challenges_and_Future_Direction","abstract":"This paper discusses the localisation of the MS Vista operating system for the Standard Yoruba language. A list of English lexical items used in MS Vista was provided and the task is to generate equivalent Yoruba terminologies. The Yoruba terminologies are required to convey the semantic connotation of the concepts presented in the MS Vista user interface. A number of techniques based on the linguistic structure of the Yoruba language were applied in generating translations and deriving equivalent lexical item words. The use of the glossary to develop the Yoruba version of MS Vista indicates that they capture the essence of the task required in the user interface. Although some user expressed reservation on non-technical aspect of the work, on the whole majority of the users expressed satisfaction on the outcome. We conclude from our experience that the task of localising for a language is a multi-disciplinary endeavour which will demand the expertise of Linguists and computer scientists.","authors":["Tunde Adegbola","Kola Owolabi","Tunji Odejobi"],"meta":[],"references":[]}
