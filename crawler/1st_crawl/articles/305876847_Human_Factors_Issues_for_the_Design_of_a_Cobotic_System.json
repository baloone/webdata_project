{"id":"305876847_Human_Factors_Issues_for_the_Design_of_a_Cobotic_System","abstract":"We present a new approach for the design of cobotic systems. It is based on several steps with increasing complexity: Activity analysis, basic design, detailed design and realization. A particular attention is paid to human factors and human systems interactions. Different simulation levels are required to provide flexibility and adaptability.","authors":["Théo Moulières-Seban","David Bitonneau","Jean-Marc Salotti","Jean-François Thibault"],"meta":["July 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-41959-6_31","Conference: 7th International Conference on Applied Human Factors and ErgonomicsAt: Orlando, FL","Project: Human-robot collaboration"],"references":["283225377_Design_projects_as_opportunities_for_the_development_of_activities","280667620_Virtual_ergonomics_for_the_design_of_collaborative_robots","220755236_Classifying_human-robot_interaction_An_updated_taxonomy","220613473_Human-Robot_Interaction_A_Survey","29648870_An_Architecture_for_Autonomy","11596569_A_model_for_types_and_levels_of_human_interaction_with_automation_IEEE_Trans_Syst_Man_Cybern_Part_A_Syst_Hum_303_286-297","285855850_A_model_for_types_and_levels_of_human_interaction_with_automation","272021251_Classification_of_physical_human-robot_interaction_scenarios_to_identify_relevant_requirements","235314121_Cobots","226463681_Performance_Evaluation_and_Design_Criteria","2923925_Theory_and_Evaluation_of_Human_Robot_Interactions"]}
