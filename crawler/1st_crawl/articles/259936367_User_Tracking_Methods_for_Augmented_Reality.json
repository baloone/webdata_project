{"id":"259936367_User_Tracking_Methods_for_Augmented_Reality","abstract":"Augmented reality has been an active area of research for the last two decades or so. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the recent literature on tracking methods used in Augmented Reality applications, both for indoor and outdoor environments. After critical discussion of the methods used for tracking, the paper identifies limitations ofthe state-of-the-art techniques and suggests potential future directions to overcome the bottlenecks.","authors":["Gazi Erkan Bostanci","Nadia Kanwal","Shoaib Ehsan","Adrian Clark"],"meta":["January 2013International Journal of Human-Computer Studies 5(1):93-98","Conference: ICMV 2010"],"references":["228932142_Fast_and_stable_tracking_for_AR_fusing_video_and_inertial_sensor_data","228630703_Towards_improving_SLAM_algorithm_development_using_augmented_reality","222676231_A_Multi-Sensor_System_for_Positioning_in_Urban_Environments","284688924_Object_tracking_A_Survey","229466043_Fusion_of_Vision_and_Inertial_Data_for_Motion_and_Structure_Estimation","228692115_Structure_and_motion_by_fusion_of_inertial_and_vision-based_tracking","228337032_Vision-based_SLAM_using_Rao-Blackwellised_particle_filter","224332304_Jun_H_Vision-based_location_positioning_using_augmented_reality_for_indoor_navigation_IEEE_Trans_Consumer_Electron_543_954-962","222407954_General_Purpose_Modular_Hardware_and_Software_Framework_for_Mobile_Outdoor_Augmented_Reality_Applications_in_Engineering","221506128_A_Vision-Based_Location_System_using_Fiducials","221221523_Online_6_DOF_Augmented_Reality_Registration_from_Natural_Features","221221431_Fast_geometry_acquisition_for_mixed_reality_applications_using_motion_tracking","221221008_Pose_tracking_from_natural_features_on_mobile_phones","221210473_Real_Positioning_in_Virtual_Environments_Using_Game_Engines","220984280_Localization_of_Walking_or_Running_User_with_Wearable_3D_Position_Sensor"]}
