{"id":"303551101_Integrated_information_theory_From_consciousness_to_its_physical_substrate","abstract":"In this Opinion article, we discuss how integrated information theory accounts for several aspects of the relationship between consciousness and the brain. Integrated information theory starts from the essential properties of phenomenal experience, from which it derives the requirements for the physical substrate of consciousness. It argues that the physical substrate of consciousness must be a maximum of intrinsic causeâ€“effect power and provides a means to determine, in principle, the quality and quantity of experience. The theory leads to some counterintuitive predictions and can be used to develop new tools for assessing consciousness in non-communicative patients.","authors":["Giulio Tononi","Melanie Boly","Marcello Massimini","Christof Koch"],"meta":["May 2016Nature Reviews Neuroscience 17(7)","DOI:10.1038/nrn.2016.44"],"references":["304541571_Natural_Waking_and_Sleep_States_A_View_From_Inside_Neocortical_Neurons","301567963_Neural_correlates_of_consciousness_Progress_and_problems","284246710_Consciousness_and_Complexity_during_Unresponsiveness_Induced_by_Propofol_Xenon_and_Ketamine","345248813_The_neural_correlates_of_dreaming","310752135_Facing_Up_to_the_Problem_of_Consciousness","307700438_Bistability_breaks-off_deterministic_responses_to_intracortical_stimulation_during_non-REM_sleep","306939383_The_magical_number_seven_plus_or_minus_two_Some_limits_on_our_capacity_to_process_information","291777069_Distributed_Hierarchical_Processing_in_the_Primate_Cerebral_Cortex","286420976_Working_memory_and_aging","284650487_The_Diagnosis_of_Stupor_and_Coma"]}
