{"id":"254283886_Some_Results_for_Discrete_Unimodality","abstract":"In a classical theorem, Ibragimov demonstrated the strong unimodality of log-concave probability density functions. Comparable results for lattice distributions are exhibited and their potential significance is suggested.","authors":["J.
