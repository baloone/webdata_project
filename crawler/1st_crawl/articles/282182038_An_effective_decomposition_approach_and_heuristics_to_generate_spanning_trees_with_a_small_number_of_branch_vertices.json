{"id":"282182038_An_effective_decomposition_approach_and_heuristics_to_generate_spanning_trees_with_a_small_number_of_branch_vertices","abstract":"Given a graph $G=(V,E)$, the minimum branch vertices problem (MBV) consists\nin finding a spanning tree $T=(V,E')$ of $G$ minimizing the number of vertices\nwith degree greater than two. We consider a simple combinatorial lower bound\nfor the problem from which we propose a decomposition approach to break down\nthe problem into several smaller subproblems that are more tractable\ncomputationally and then recombine the obtained solutions to generate a\nsolution to the original larger problem. We also propose effective constructive\nheuristics to the problem which take into consideration the problem structure\nin order to obtain good feasible solutions. Computational results show that our\ndecomposition approach is very fast and can drastically reduce the size of the\nsubproblems that have to be solved, allowing a branch-and-cut algorithm to\nperform much better than when used over the full original problem. The results\nalso show that the proposed constructive heuristics are very rapid and generate\nvery good quality solutions, outperforming other heuristics available in the\nliterature in several situations.","authors":["Rafael A.
