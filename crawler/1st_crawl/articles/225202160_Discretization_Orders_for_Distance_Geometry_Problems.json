{"id":"225202160_Discretization_Orders_for_Distance_Geometry_Problems","abstract":"Given a weighted, undirected simple graph G=(V, E, d) (where \n\nd:E®\\mathbbR+{d:E\\to\\mathbb{R}_+}), the distance geometry problem (DGP) is to determine an embedding \n\nx:V®\\mathbbRK{x:V\\to\\mathbb{R}^K} such that \"{i,j} Î E||xi-xj||=dij{\\forall \\{i,j\\} \\in E\\;\\|x_i-x_j\\|=d_{ij}} . Although, in general, the DGP is solved using continuous methods, under certain conditions the search is reduced to a discrete\nset of points. We give one such condition as a particular order on V. We formalize the decision problem of determining whether such an order exists for a given graph and show that this problem\nis NP-complete in general and polynomial for fixed dimension K. We present results of computational experiments on a set of protein backbones whose natural atomic order does not satisfy\nthe order requirements and compare our approach with some available continuous space searches.\n\nKeywordsMolecular distance geometry–Proteins–Sensor network localization–Graph drawing","authors":["Carlile Lavor","Jon Lee","Audrey St. John","Leo Liberti"],"meta":["April 2012Optimization Letters 6(4):783-796","DOI:10.1007/s11590-011-0302-6"],"references":["249991669_Counting_the_number_of_solutions_of_the_Discretizable_Molecular_Distance_Geometry_Problem","245973187_Double_VNS_for_the_Molecular_Distance_Geometry_Problem","289240516_Theory_of_semidefinite_programming_for_sensor_network_localization","285981037_Global_continuation_for_distance_geometry_problems","285243012_Optimal_sizing_for_a_class_of_nonlinearly_elastic_materials","270903100_The_Protein_Data_Bank","266367010_A_Tabu_Based_Pattern_Search_Method_for_the_Distance_Geometry_Problem","264465058_A_Branch-and-Prune_Algorithm_for_the_Molecular_Distance_Geometry_Problem","252858033_Multispace_Search_For_Protein_Folding","245921920_Die_Graphische_Statik_der_Starren_Systeme","244235393_Grover's_Algorithm_applied_to_the_Molecular_Distance_Geometry_Problem","242314200_On_the_Definition_of_Artificial_Backbones_for_the_Discretizable_Molecular_Distance_Geometry_Problem","229325056_Exploiting_Symmetry_Properties_of_the_Discretizable_Molecular_Distance_Geometry_Problem","228665757_On_the_solution_of_molecular_distance_geometry_problems_with_interval_data","238765684_Theory_and_Applications_of_Distance_Geometry"]}
