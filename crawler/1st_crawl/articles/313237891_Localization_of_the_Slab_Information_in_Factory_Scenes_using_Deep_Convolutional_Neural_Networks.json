{"id":"313237891_Localization_of_the_Slab_Information_in_Factory_Scenes_using_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","abstract":"This paper proposes a novel algorithm for localizing slab identification numbers (SINs) in factory scenes. Automatic identification of product information is important for the process management, and localization of SINs in complex scenes is a major challenge for the recognition. A previous rule-based localization algorithm for SINs requires lots of prior knowledge and heuristic tuning for parameters. In this paper, a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) is employed to overcome these limitations, and accumulated confidence is proposed to utilize neighboring outputs of the DCNN in a scene. The localization error is remarkably reduced to 1.44% by the proposed algorithm compared to 4.59% in the previous work. The proposed data-driven method can be applied to construct other automatic identification systems with minimal manual handling.","authors":["Sang-Jun Lee","Sang Woo Kim"],"meta":["January 2017Expert Systems with Applications 77","DOI:10.1016/j.eswa.2017.01.026"],"references":["289917319_Deep_Neural_Networks_for_object_detection","273126576_Text_Detection_and_Recognition_in_Imagery_A_Survey","261202637_Text_location_in_complex_images","221120132_Robust_text_detection_in_natural_images_with_edge-enhanced_Maximally_Stable_Extremal_Regions","296490595_Advances_in_Neural_Information_Processing_Systems","286794765_Dropout_A_Simple_Way_to_Prevent_Neural_Networks_from_Overfitting","277920666_Region-Based_Convolutional_Networks_for_Accurate_Object_Detection_and_Segmentation","271471500_Deep_learning_of_feature_representation_with_multiple_instance_learning_for_medical_image_analysis","269280573_Reading_Text_in_the_Wild_with_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","267960550_ImageNet_Classification_with_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","267709055_Deep_Neural_Networks_Segment_Neuronal_Membranes_in_Electron_Microscopy_Images","263564119_DeepFace_Closing_the_Gap_to_Human-Level_Performance_in_Face_Verification","263237865_Spatial_Pyramid_Pooling_in_Deep_Convolutional_Networks_for_Visual_Recognition","261345514_A_New_Control_Algorithm_for_Hydraulic_Universal_Testing_Machine_Based_on_Extenics","261121699_Real-time_scene_text_localization_and_recognition","257403921_Localizing_slab_identification_numbers_in_factory_scene_images","223431999_Accurate_text_localization_in_images_based_on_SVM_output_scores","222674563_Text_information_extraction_in_images_and_video_A_survey","222412464_A_stroke_filter_and_its_application_to_text_localization","221885177_Multi-Column_Deep_Neural_Network_for_Traffic_Sign_Classification","221345737_Rectified_Linear_Units_Improve_Restricted_Boltzmann_Machines_Vinod_Nair","221345446_Large-scale_deep_unsupervised_learning_using_graphics_processors","220648366_Learning_Long-Range_Vision_for_Autonomous_Off-Road_Driving","216792879_Backpropagation_Applied_to_Handwritten_Zip_Code_Recognition"]}
