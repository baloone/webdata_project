{"id":"228939782_Cache-timing_attacks_on_AES","abstract":"This paper demonstrates complete AES key recovery from known-plaintext timings of a network server on another computer. This attack should be blamed on the AES design, not on the particular AES library used by the server; it is extremely difficult to write constant-time high-speed AES software for common general-purpose computers. This paper discusses several of the obstacles in detail.","authors":["Daniel J Bernstein"],"meta":[],"references":["225899150_Provably_secure_masking_of_AES","220065554_Side_Channel_Cryptanalysis_of_Product_Ciphers","2439823_Report_on_the_Development_of_the_Advanced_Encryption_Standard_AES","265044105_How_to_optimize_for_the_Pentium_family_of_microprocessors","260067570_Cryptographic_Hardware_and_Embedded_Systems_-_CHES_2003","243775794_Ta-dayoshi_Kohno_Helix_Fast_Encryption_and_Authentication_in_a_Single_Cryptographic_Primitive","243771699_Resistance_against_implementation_attacks_A_comparative_study_of_the_AES_proposals","223151528_Remote_Timing_Attacks_are_Practical","221291954_Cryptanalysis_of_DES_Implemented_on_Computers_with_Cache","220942588_Helix_-_Fast_Encryption_and_Authentication_in_a_Single_Cryptographic_Primitive","220942531_TEA_A_tiny_encryption_algorithm","220690227_Practical_Cryptography","220335456_Theoretical_Use_of_Cache_Memory_as_a_Cryptanalytic_Side-Channel","37443138_Fast_Software_Encryption_5th_International_Workshop_FSE'98","2941479_The_Security_and_Performance_of_the_GaloisCounter_Mode_GCM_of_Operation","2608533_A_timing_attack_against_Rijndael","2582060_Timing_Attacks_on_Implementations_of_Diffie-Hellman_RSA_DSS_and_Other_Systems"]}
