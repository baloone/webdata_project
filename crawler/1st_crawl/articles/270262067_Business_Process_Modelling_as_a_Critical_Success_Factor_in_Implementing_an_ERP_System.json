Although there are tremendous benefits to implementing an ERP system, there are just as many risks. The problem is that many projects of this type are unsuccessful, mostly due to their complexity being underestimated. The purpose of the paper is twofold: (1) to analyse the critical success factors (CFSs) of ERP implementation projects and (2) to propose a framework based on a composite approach to ERP systems implementation. A special emphasis is given to business process modelling, because the key to the successful choice, implementation and usage of an ERP system is the fit of planned processes in an organisation with processes implemented in the solution. The paper also presents some results of empirical investigation in the field of ERP implementation.","authors":["Mojca Indihar Stemberger","Vesna Bosilj Vuksic","Andrej Kovačič"],"meta":["November 2009South East European Journal of Economics and Business 4(2)","DOI:10.2478/v10033-009-0014-3"],"references":["241711633_Success_and_Failure_Factors_of_Adopting_SAP_in_ERP_System_Installation","235313093_Critical_Factors_for_Successful_Implementation_of_Enterprise_Systems","235309156_Synchronous_design_of_business_processes_and_information_systems_using_dynamic_process_modelling","287389652_Corporate_applications_integration_Challenges_opportunities_and_implementation_strategies","284048696_Using_the_structurational_model_of_technology_to_analyze_an_ERP_implementation","277491366_Enterprise_resource_planning","263211855_Critical_elements_for_a_successful_enterprise_resource_planning_implementation_in_small-_And_medium-sized_enterprises","242025963_Planning_for_ERP_systems_Analysis_and_future_trend","235321962_ERP_implementation_efforts_at_three_firms_Integrating_lessons_from_the_SISP_and_IT-enabled_change_literature","235295230_Impediments_to_successful_ERP_implementation_process"]}
