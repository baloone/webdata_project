{"id":"315664446_Microservices_yesterday_today_and_tomorrow","abstract":"Microservices is an architectural style inspired by service-oriented computing that has recently started gaining popularity. Before presenting the current state-of-the-art in the field, this chapter reviews the history of software architecture, the reasons that led to the diffusion of objects and services first, and microservices later. Finally, open problems and future challenges are introduced. This survey primarily addresses newcomers to the discipline, while offering an academic viewpoint on the topic. In addition, we investigate some practical issues and point out some potential solutions.","authors":["Nicola Dragoni","Saverio Giallorenzo","Alberto Lluch-Lafuente","Manuel Mazzara"],"meta":["January 2017","In book: Present And Ulterior Software EngineeringPublisher: SpringerEditors: Bertrand Meyer, Manuel Mazzara"],"references":["324593047_TOWARDS_STATIC_TYPE-CHECKING_FOR_JOLIE","322500050_Fallacies_of_Distributed_Computing_Explained","316620158_Microservices_A_Language-Based_Approach","313898767_Towards_Static_Type-checking_for_Jolie","313898488_Microservices_How_To_Make_Your_Application_Scale","313799181_Measuring_Coupling_in_Object-Oriented_Systems","310758645_Multiparty_session_types_as_coherence_proofs","308796556_Jolie_Community_on_the_Rise","303513303_Data-Driven_Workflows_for_Microservices_Genericity_in_Jolie","301845953_Choreographies_Divided_and_Conquered","301844706_Refinement_Types_in_Jolie","282906640_Applied_Choreographies","274007961_Rahman-Gao-_A_Reusable_Automated_Acceptance_Testing_Architecture_for_Microservices_in_Behavior-Driven_Development-camera_ready_version","272195236_Kickstarting_Choreographic_Programming","268256884_Towards_Abstractions_for_Web_Services_Composition","262273083_Process-aware_Web_programming_with_Jolie","262213061_Deadlock-freedom-by-design_Multiparty_Asynchronous_Global_Programming","238729882_Measuring_coupling_and_cohesion_in_object-oriented_systems","228403638_Reference_model_for_service_oriented_architecture_10","222551566_A_pi-calculus_based_semantics_for_WS-BPEL","221602730_Language_Primitives_and_Type_Discipline_for_Structured_Communication-Based_Programming","221105839_Software_Architecture_The_Next_Step","329885979_Microservices_Migration_of_a_Mission_Critical_System","316089974_A_Core_Model_for_Choreographic_Programming","312752099_Structured_Communication-Centered_Programming_for_Web_Services","312391505_In_search_of_an_understandable_consensus_algorithm","308847935_Microservice-based_architecture_for_the_NRDC","306264623_Self-Reconfiguring_Microservices","304406781_Security-as-a-Service_for_Microservices-Based_Cloud_Applications","303789186_Multiparty_asynchronous_session_types","303482322_Multiparty_Session_Types_Within_a_Canonical_Binary_Theory_and_Beyond","303482293_Enforcing_Availability_in_Failure-Aware_Communicating_Systems","303095171_Process-aware_web_programming_with_Jolie","278801304_Service-Oriented_Programming_with_Jolie","262287566_Higher-Order_Processes_Functions_and_Sessions_A_Monadic_Integration","262238113_Compositional_Choreographies","261960832_Docker_lightweight_Linux_containers_for_consistent_development_and_deployment","259365879_Software_agents_An_overview","254464176_Propositions_as_Sessions","247925242_The_Mythical_Man-month","245624208_CCS-A_Calculus_for_Communicating_Systems","242433591_How_do_committees_invent_datamation","239591625_Component_Software_Beyond_Object-Oriented_Programming","234801207_Patterns_of_Enterprise_Application_Architecture","234788316_The_Art_of_Unix_Programming","224773145_Design_Patterns_Elements_of_Reusable_Object-Oriented_Software","224101964_Design_and_Code_Inspections_to_Reduce_Errors_in_Program_Development","224001291_Software_Architecture_Perspectives_on_an_Emerging_Discipline","223227853_Prediction_and_control_of_ADA_software_defects","221993012_Quantitative_models_of_cohesion_and_coupling_in_software","220994131_A_Case_Study_of_Web_Services_Orchestration","220812785_A_Universal_Modular_ACTOR_Formalism_for_Artificial_Intelligence","220700424_Session_Types_as_Intuitionistic_Linear_Propositions","220902901_Measuring_Coupling_and_Cohesion_of_Software_Modules_An_Information-Theory_Approach","220888950_Towards_a_Unifying_Theory_for_Choreography_Conformance_and_Contract_Compliance"]}
