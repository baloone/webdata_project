{"id":"265471932_Quasi_3D_ECE_imaging_system_for_study_of_MHD_instabilities_in_KSTARa","abstract":"A second electron cyclotron emission imaging (ECEI) system has been installed on the KSTAR tokamak, toroidally separated by 1/16th of the torus from the first ECEI system. For the first time, the dynamical evolutions of MHD instabilities from the plasma core to the edge have been visualized in quasi-3D for a wide range of the KSTAR operation (B 0 = 1.7âˆ¼3.5 T). This flexible diagnostic capability has been realized by substantial improvements in large-aperture quasi-optical microwave components including the development of broad-band polarization rotators for imaging of the funda-mental ordinary ECE as well as the usual 2nd harmonic extraordinary ECE.","authors":["Gunsu S.
