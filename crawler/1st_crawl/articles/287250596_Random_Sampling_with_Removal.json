{"id":"287250596_Random_Sampling_with_Removal","abstract":"Random sampling is a classical tool in constrained optimization. Under\nfavorable conditions, the optimal solution subject to a small subset of\nrandomly chosen constraints violates only a small subset of the remaining\nconstraints. Here we study the following variant that we call random sampling\nwith removal: suppose that after sampling the subset, we remove a fixed number\nof constraints from the sample, according to an arbitrary rule. Is it still\ntrue that the optimal solution of the reduced sample violates only a small\nsubset of the constraints?\nThe question naturally comes up in situations where the solution subject to\nthe sampled constraints is used as an approximate solution to the original\nproblem. In this case, it makes sense to improve cost and volatility of the\nsample solution by removing some of the constraints that appear most\nrestricting. At the same time, the approximation quality (measured in terms of\nviolated constraints) should remain high.\nWe study random sampling with removal in a generalized, completely abstract\nsetting where we assign to each subset $R$ of the constraints an arbitrary set\n$V(R)$ of constraints disjoint from $R$; in applications, $V(R)$ corresponds to\nthe constraints violated by the optimal solution subject to only the\nconstraints in R. Furthermore, our results are parametrized by the dimension\n$\\delta$.\nIn this setting, we prove matching upper and lower bounds for the expected\nnumber of constraints violated by a random sample, after the removal of $k$\nelements. For a large range of values of $k$, the new upper bounds improve the\npreviously best bounds for LP-type problems, which moreover had only been known\nin special cases. We show that this bound on special LP-type problems, can be\nderived in the much more general setting of violator spaces, and with very\nelementary proofs.","authors":["Bernd GÃ¤rtner","Johannes Lengler","May Szedlak"],"meta":["October 2020Discrete & Computational Geometry 64(1)","DOI:10.1007/s00454-020-00193-0","SourcearXiv"],"references":["324924475_Chance-constrained_convex_mixed-integer_optimization_and_beyond_Two_sampling_algorithms_within_S-optimization","313671985_Epsilon-approximations_and_epsilon-nets","313198166_A_combinatorial_bound_for_linear_programming_and_related_problems_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science_577","312527266_An_observation_on_the_structure_of_production_sets_with_indivisibilities","287963873_A_Subexponential_Bound_for_Linear_Programming","266656378_Sampling_with_Removal_in_LP-type_Problems","247442902_Introduction_To_Algorithms","239583443_Subexponential_randomized_Simplex_algorithm","228808252_The_Exact_Feasibility_of_Randomized_Solutions_of_Robust_Convex_Programs","228057769_Probability_Inequalities_for_Sums_of_Bounded_Random_Variables","226668974_Uncertain_convex_programs_Randomized_solutions_and_confidence_levels","228057688_Applications_of_Random_Sampling_in_Computational_Geometry_II","226714951_A_Subexponential_Bound_for_Linear_Programming","226611384_Unique_Sink_Orientations_of_Grids","225886707_A_randomized_algorithm_for_fixed-dimensional_linear_programming"]}
