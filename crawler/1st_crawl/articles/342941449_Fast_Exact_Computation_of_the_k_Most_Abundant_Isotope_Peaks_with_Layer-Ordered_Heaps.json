{"id":"342941449_Fast_Exact_Computation_of_the_k_Most_Abundant_Isotope_Peaks_with_Layer-Ordered_Heaps","abstract":"Computation of the isotopic distribution of compounds is crucial to applications of mass spectrometry, particularly as machine precision continues to improve. In the last decade, several tools have been created for doing so. In this paper we present a novel algorithm for calculating the most abundant $k$ isotopologue peaks of a compound. The algorithm uses Serang's optimal method of selection on Cartesian products. The method is significantly faster than the state-of-the-art on large compounds (\\emph{e.g.}, Titin protein) and on compounds whose elements have many isotopes (\\emph{e.g.}, Palladium alloys).","authors":["Patrick Kreitzberg","Jake Pennington","Kyle Lucke","Oliver Serang"],"meta":["July 2020Analytical Chemistry XXXX(XXX)","DOI:10.1021/acs.analchem.0c01670"],"references":["5485228_OpenMS_-_An_open-source_software_framework_for_mass_spectrometry","333227798_Efficient_simulation_of_isotope_aggregated_and_fine_structure_by_vector_manipulation_and_change-making_strategy","332450692_Deep_MSMS-Aided_Structural-Similarity_Scoring_for_Unknown_Metabolite_Identification","323302779_Selection_from_heaps_row-sorted_matrices_and_XY_using_soft_heaps","321537610_Poisson_Model_To_Generate_Isotope_Distribution_for_Biomolecules","314022607_IsoSpec_Hyperfast_Fine_Structure_Calculator","297585860_Rapid_Screening_for_Exposure_to_Non-Target_Pharmaceuticals_from_Wastewater_Effluents_by_Combining_HRMS-Based_Suspect_Screening_and_Exposure_Modeling","282153234_Quantitative_target_and_systematic_non-target_analysis_of_polar_organic_micro-pollutants_along_the_river_Rhine_using_high-resolution_mass-spectrometry_-_Identification_of_unknown_sources_and_compounds","275665830_Accelerated_Isotope_Fine_Structure_Calculation_Using_Pruned_Transition_Trees","262537898_Efficient_Calculation_of_Exact_Fine_Structure_Isotope_Patterns_via_the_Multidimensional_Fourier_Transform","244570255_Determination_of_monoisotopic_masses_and_ion_populations_for_large_biomolecules_from_resolved_isotopic_distributions","222219413_Time_Bounds_for_Selection","220432308_The_soft_heap_An_approximate_priority_queue_with_optimal_error_rate"]}
