{"id":"349277064_Bidirectional_LSTM_Networks_for_Improved_Phoneme_Classification_and_Recognition","abstract":"In this paper, we carry out two experiments on the TIMIT speech corpus with bidirectional and unidirectional Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks. In the first experiment (framewise phoneme classification) we find that bidirectional LSTM outperforms both unidirectional LSTM and conventional Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). In the second (phoneme recognition) we find that a hybrid BLSTM-HMM system improves on an equivalent traditional HMM system, as well as unidirectional LSTM-HMM.","authors":["Alex Graves","Santiago Fernández","Jürgen Schmidhuber"],"meta":["September 2005","DOI:10.1007/11550907_126","In book: Artificial Neural Networks: Formal Models and Their Applications – ICANN 2005 (pp.799-804)"],"references":["230875873_Connectionist_Speech_Recognition_A_Hybrid_Approach","221480683_REMAP_recursive_estimation_and_maximization_of_a_posteriori_probabilities_in_connectionist_speech_recognition","220320057_Learning_Precise_Timing_with_LSTM_Recurrent_Networks","13853244_Long_Short-term_Memory","12571895_Exploiting_the_Past_and_the_Future_in_Protein_Secondary_Structure_Prediction","3316656_Bidirectional_recurrent_neural_networks","224257483_Experiments_on_the_implementation_of_recurrent_neural_networks_for_speech_phone_recognition","7647316_Framewise_phoneme_classification_with_bidirectional_LSTM_and_other_neural_network_architectures","5583952_Application_of_recurrent_nets_to_phone_probability_estimation"]}
