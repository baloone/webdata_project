{"id":"338981643_Fuzzy_Hypergraphs","abstract":"In this chapter, we present fundamental and technical concepts like fuzzy hypergraphs, fuzzy column hypergraphs, fuzzy row hypergraphs, fuzzy competition hypergraphs, fuzzy k-competition hypergraphs, fuzzy neighborhood hypergraphs, and \\({\\mathscr {N}}\\)-hypergraphs. We describe applications of fuzzy competition hypergraphs in decision support systems, including predatorâ€“prey relations in ecological niches, social networks, and business marketing. Further, we introduce complex fuzzy hypergraphs, \\(\\mu e^{i\\theta }\\)-level hypergraphs, covering constructions, 2-sections, and \\(L_2\\)-sections of these hypergraphs.","authors":["Muhammad Akram","Anam Luqman"],"meta":["February 2020","DOI:10.1007/978-981-15-2403-5_1","In book: Fuzzy Hypergraphs and Related Extensions (pp.1-75)"],"references":["327689068_A_New_Method_to_Decision-Making_with_Fuzzy_Competition_Hypergraphs","321806752_Hyperfuzzy_ideals_in_BCKBCI-algebras","279322641_Tempered_interval-valued_fuzzy_hypergraphs","276849270_m-Step_fuzzy_competition_graphs","236943359_Fuzzy_k_-Competition_Graphs_and_p_-Competition_Fuzzy_Graphs","3114475_Fuzzy_Hypergraph_and_Fuzzy_Partition","337707112_Energy_of_a_complex_fuzzy_graph","327821441_A_hypergraph_model_for_representing_scientific_output","312632771_A_systematic_review_of_complex_fuzzy_sets_and_logic","302558561_Graphs_and_Hypergraphs","278179985_On_N-hypergraphs","271248158_Isomorphism_on_Fuzzy_Hypergraphs","265629445_Fuzzy_graphs_and_fuzzy_hypergraphs","265458358_Fuzzy_cycles_and_fuzzy_trees","258789570_Isomorphism_Properties_on_Strong_Fuzzy_Hypergraphs","247520571_Similarity_and_fuzzy_ordering","242799918_Fuzzy_colorings_of_fuzzy_hypergraphs","238802696_Fuzzy_transversals_of_fuzzy_hypergraphs","238802653_Introduction_to_fuzzy_hypergraphs_and_Hebbian_structures","235201835_Fuzzy_Hypergraphs_and_Fuzzy_Intersection_Graphs","224285703_Uncertain_rule-based_fuzzy_logic_systems_introduction_and_new_directions","223593669_Zadeh_LA_Similarity_Relations_and_Fuzzy_Orderings_Information_Sciences_3_177-200","222456104_Zadeh_LA_The_concept_of_a_linguistic_variable_and_its_application_to_approximate_reasoning_Part_1_Inform_Sci_8_199-249_Part_2_Inform_Sci_8_301-353_Part_3_Inform_Sci_9_43-80","222439366_Fuzzy_Sets","220646312_Fuzzy_line_graphs","220568312_Competition_hypergraphs","220468842_Competition_hypergraphs_of_digraphs_with_certain_properties_II_Hamiltonicity","220314865_Operations_on_Fuzzy_Graphs","3336045_Complex_fuzzy_sets"]}
