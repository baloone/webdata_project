{"id":"341779205_Staircase_Traversal_via_Reinforcement_Learning_for_Active_Reconfiguration_of_Assistive_Robots","abstract":"Assistive robots introduce a new paradigm for developing advanced personalized services. At the same time, the variability and stochasticity of environments, hardware and unknown parameters of the interaction complicates their modelling , as in the case of staircase traversal. For this task, we propose to treat the problem of robot configuration control within a reinforcement learning framework, using policy gradient optimization. In particular, we examine the use of safety or traction measures as a means for endowing the learned policy with desired properties. Using the proposed framework, we present extensive qualitative and quantitative results where a simulated robot learns to negotiate staircases of variable size, while being subjected to different levels of sensing noise.","authors":["Andrei Mitriakov","Panagiotis Papadakis","Sao Mai Nguyen","Serge Garlatti"],"meta":["July 2020","DOI:10.1109/FUZZ48607.2020.9177581","Conference: 2020 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE)At: Glasgow, UK","Project: REACT, VITAAL"],"references":["341779519_Learning-based_modelling_of_physical_interaction_for_assistive_robots","321965954_System_Design_for_Coordinated_Multi-Robot_Assistance_Deployment_in_Smart_Spaces","318235585_Plug_and_Play_your_Robot_into_your_Smart_Home_Illustration_of_a_New_Framework_A_Communication_Protocol_to_Plug_and_Play_any_Robot_or_Device_of_a_Smart_Home","314943370_Fast_Simulation_of_Vehicles_with_Non-deformable_Tracks","332819426_Autonomous_Stairwell_Ascent","327921497_Learning_to_Run_Challenge_Solutions_Adapting_Reinforcement_Learning_Methods_for_Neuromusculoskeletal_Environments","323410756_Addressing_Function_Approximation_Error_in_Actor-Critic_Methods","322876127_Motion_control_technology_study_on_tracked_robot_with_swing_arms","321098496_Fast_Simulation_of_Vehicles_with_Non-deformable_Tracks","318584439_Proximal_Policy_Optimization_Algorithms","285979522_Model-based_contextual_policy_search_for_data-efficient_generalization_of_robot_skills","280771249_Remote_control_system_of_disaster_response_robot_with_passive_sub-crawlers_considering_falling_down_avoidance","259174252_3D_Mobility_Learning_and_Regression_of_Articulated_Tracked_Robotic_Vehicles_by_Physics-based_Optimization","312241102_Autonomous_flipper_control_with_safety_constraints","270410909_A_Survey_on_Policy_Search_for_Robotics"]}
