{"id":"256650364_A_Space_Optimal_Deterministic_Self-Stabilizing_Leader_Election_Algorithm_for_Unidirectional_Rings","abstract":"A new, self-stabilizing algorithm for electing a leader on a unidirectional ring of prime size is presented for the composite atom-icity model with a centralized daemon. Its space complexity is optimal to within a small additive constant number of bits per processor, signif-icantly improving previous self-stabilizing algorithms for this problem. In other models or when the ring size is composite, no deterministic solutions exist, because it is impossible to break symmetry.","authors":["Faith Ellen","Colette Johnen"],"meta":["January 2001","Conference: the 15th International Symposium on Distributed Computing"],"references":["256649988_Cross-Over_Composition_-_Enforcement_of_Fairness_under_Unfair_Adversary","244953972_A_Comprehensive_Bibliography_on_Self-Stabilization","243763312_Global_and_local_properties_in_networks_of_processors","225707516_Memory_requirements_for_silent_stabilization","221590390_Local_and_Global_Properties_in_Networks_of_Processors_Extended_Abstract","221448230_Uniform_Self-Stabilizing_Rings","221039077_SelfStabilizing_Token_Circulation_on_Anonymous_Message_Passing","220617032_The_Bit_Complexity_of_Randomized_Leader_Election_on_a_Ring","220567075_A_Belated_Proof_of_Self-Stabilization","220423523_Dijkstra_EW_Self-stabilizing_Systems_in_Spite_of_Distributed_Control_ACM_Commun_1711_643-644"]}
