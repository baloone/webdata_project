{"id":"265295282_Message_Encoding_and_Retrieval_for_Spread_and_Cyclic_Orbit_Codes","abstract":"Spread codes and cyclic orbit codes are special families of constant\ndimension subspace codes. These codes have been well-studied for their error\ncorrection capability, transmission rate and decoding methods, but the question\nof how to encode and retrieve messages has not been investigated. In this work\nwe show how a message set of consecutive integers can be encoded and retrieved\nfor these two code families.","authors":["Anna-Lena Horlemann-Trautmann"],"meta":["February 2018Designs Codes and Cryptography 86(1)","DOI:10.1007/s10623-017-0377-x","SourcearXiv"],"references":["281216279_Constructions_decoding_and_automorphisms_of_subspace_codes","266893609_Multicomponent_Network_Coding","262029956_Subspace_Polynomials_and_Cyclic_Subspace_Codes","334427570_Multicomponent_Subspace_Codes_in_Network_Coding","329322984_Handbook_of_Applied_Cryptography","270066303_Introduction_to_Finite_Fields_and_Their_Applications","266752948_Applied_finite_group_actions_2nd_rev_and_exp_ed","265374085_Projective_Geometries_Over_Finite_Fields","264945958_Modern_Computer_Algebra","261952162_Subspace_Codes_Based_on_Graph_Matchings_Ferrers_Diagrams_and_Pending_Blocks","260557412_Cyclic_Orbit_Codes_and_Stabilizer_Subfields","259692531_Construction_of_Large_Constant_Dimension_Codes_with_a_Prescribed_Minimum_Distance","259571887_Message_Encoding_for_Spread_and_Orbit_Codes","244446876_Vanstone_Handbook_of_Applied_Cryptography","243777782_Harald_Niederreiter_Introduction_to_finite_fields_and_their_applications"]}
