{"id":"319972875_Domain_Theory_its_Ramifications_and_Interactions","abstract":"At a conference that is devoted to a specific research area – Domain Theory in this case – there should be room for reflecting its rôle within the concert of scientific fields that sometimes cooperate and sometimes compete for recognition. It is the intention of this paper to stimulate interactions of Domain Theory with other research areas. Thus, this is not a research paper. It is the intention, firstly, to recall that Domain Theory has its historical roots in quite different fields, secondly, to indicate its interactions with other areas and not only with Computer Science, and thirdly. to put forward a new development in the theory of C*-algebras that opens new perspectives.","authors":["Klaus Keimel"],"meta":["September 2017Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science 333:3-16","DOI:10.1016/j.entcs.2017.08.002"],"references":["303521259_The_Cuntz_semigroup_and_domain_theory","267114975_Continuous_lattices_and_A-spaces","266396750_Tensor_products_and_regularity_properties_of_Cuntz_semigroups","251394986_Continuous_lattices","321523370_Theory_and_Applications_of_Computability","285232966_Extensions_of_Domain_Maps_in_Differential_and_Integral_Calculus","284891967_Countable_functionals_in_Constructivity_in_Mathematics_Proceedings_of_the_Colloquium_Held_at_Amsterdam_1957","273005795_Weak_topologies_and_compactness_in_asymmetric_functional_analysis","268612143_Topological_Semilattices_with_Small_Semilattices","266054264_A_Domain-Theoretic_Account_of_Picard's_Theorem"]}
