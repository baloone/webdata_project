{"id":"267122432_Context-free_grammar_induction_with_grammar-based_classifier_system","abstract":"We deal with the induction of context-free grammars from sample sentences. We present some extensions to Grammar-Based Classifier system (GCS) that evolves population of classifiers represented by context-free grammar productions rules in Chomsky normal form. GCS is a new version of Learning Classifier Systems but it differs from it in the covering, in the matching, and in representation. We modify the discovering component of the GCS and apply system for inferring such context-free languages as toy language, and grammar for large corpora of part-of-speech tagged natural English language. For each task a set of experiments was performed.","authors":["Olgierd Unold"],"meta":["January 2005Archives of Control Sciences 15(4)"],"references":[]}
