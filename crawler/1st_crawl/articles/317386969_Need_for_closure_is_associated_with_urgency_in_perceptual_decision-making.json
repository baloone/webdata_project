{"id":"317386969_Need_for_closure_is_associated_with_urgency_in_perceptual_decision-making","abstract":"Constant decision-making underpins much of daily life, from simple perceptual decisions about navigation through to more complex decisions about important life events. At many scales, a fundamental task of the decision-maker is to balance competing needs for caution and urgency: fast decisions can be more efficient, but also more often wrong. We show how a single mathematical framework for decision-making explains the urgency/caution balance across decision-making at two very different scales. This explanation has been applied at the level of neuronal circuits (on a time scale of hundreds of milliseconds) through to the level of stable personality traits (time scale of years).","authors":["Nathan J Evans","Babette Rae","Maxim Bushmakin","Mark Rubin"],"meta":["June 2017Memory & Cognition 45(37)","DOI:10.3758/s13421-017-0718-z"],"references":["284730845_Different_Ways_of_Linking_Behavioral_and_Neural_Data_via_Computational_Cognitive_Models","283836673_The_surprising_relationship_between_indecisiveness_and_impulsivity","281838167_The_Fallacy_of_Placing_Confidence_in_Confidence_Intervals","324513440_Response_of_Neurons_in_the_Lateral_Intraparietal_Area_during_a_Combined_Visual_Discrimination_Reaction_Time_Task","308299961_The_Bayesian_New_Statistics_Two_Historical_Trends_Converge","306927838_People_adopt_optimal_policies_in_simple_decision-making_after_practice_and_guidance","297618349_Diffusion_Decision_Model_Current_Issues_and_History","287270876_The_Psychology_of_Closed_Mindedness","285603122_An_Introduction_to_Model-Based_Cognitive_Neuroscience","283358777_Need_for_cognition_and_need_for_cognitive_closure"]}
