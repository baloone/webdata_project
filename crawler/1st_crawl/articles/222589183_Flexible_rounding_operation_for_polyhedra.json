{"id":"222589183_Flexible_rounding_operation_for_polyhedra","abstract":"The paper describes a local rounding operation for polyhedral models defined by a boundary representation. The edges of a solid are replaced by cylindrical surfaces, and, at the vertices where these cylinders meet, rectangular patches are constructed with common tangent planes at their common corner points. A range of rounding radii can be chosen, and the shape of the blending surfaces can be deformed by scalar parameters, making them flatter or sharper. All the patches composing the surface are bicubic patches defined by the geometric data, i.e. the corner points, the tangents of the boundary line, and the twist vectors at the corner points. The patches are fitted into the boundary representation of the polyhedron such that its topological structure remains the same.","authors":["M.
