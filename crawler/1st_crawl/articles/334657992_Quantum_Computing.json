{"id":"334657992_Quantum_Computing","abstract":"In computer science field, according to Moore's law, the number of microprocessor components doubles every 18 months. In other terms, size of transistors is approaching the size of atoms. This law may become false because of the quantum effects at very small scales, atoms size being a fundamental barrier. Richard Feynman, a well-known physicist, suggested a solution: Changing the paradigm and rethinking the classical information model underlying computation that is based on two states : 0 and 1. He proposed not to try to undergo these quantum effects, but to use them to ensure sort of parallelism of calculation which is the foundation of quantum computation.","authors":["Halima Bouzidi","Yasmine Djebrouni"],"meta":["November 2018","Project: Quantum computing"],"references":["2198164_Quantum_Memory_Hierarchies_Efficient_Designs_to_Match_Available_Parallelism_in_Quantum_Computing","262321971_A_blueprint_for_building_a_quantum_computer"]}
