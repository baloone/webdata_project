{"id":"299344207_Epistemic_Opacity_Confirmation_Holism_and_Technical_Debt_Computer_Simulation_in_the_Light_of_Empirical_Software_Engineering","abstract":"Software-intensive science, and in particular the method of modelling\nlarge and complex systems by means of computer simulation,\npresents acute dilemmas of epistemic trust. Some authors have contended\nthat simulations are essentially epistemically opaque vis and vis a human\nagent, others that complex simulation models suffer from an inescapable\nconfirmation holism. We argue that the shortcomings lie in the failure of\nmodellers to adopt sound Software Engineering practices, and that the\nelevation of computational models into superior epistemic authorities runs\ncounter to principles that are common to both Science and Software\nEngineering.","authors":["Julian Newman"],"meta":["August 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-47286-7_18","Conference: HaPoC 2015At: Pisa, Italy","Project: Epistemology of Software applied to Computational Science"],"references":["308868573_Sustainability_Design_and_Software_The_Karlskrona_Manifesto","291995257_What_is_a_model_why_people_don't_trust_them_and_why_they_should_In_Negotiating_Our_Future_Living_Scenarios_for_Australia_to_2050","346678208_Extending_Ourselves","317618293_Conjectures_and_Refutations_The_Growth_of_Scientific_Knowledge","312489093_The_wisdom_of_the_body","308859303_A_Case_Study_in_Locating_the_Architectural_Roots_of_Technical_Debt","307534272_The_theory_of_affordances","304395385_Toward_an_Axiological_Turn_in_the_Philosophy_of_Technology","292217432_The_fellowship_of_the_microchip_Global_technologies_as_evocative_objects","292119167_A_Software_Fault_Prevention_Approach_in_Coding_and_Root_Cause_Analysis"]}
