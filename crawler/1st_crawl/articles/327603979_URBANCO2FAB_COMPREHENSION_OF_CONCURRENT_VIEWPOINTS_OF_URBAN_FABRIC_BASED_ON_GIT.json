{"id":"327603979_URBANCO2FAB_COMPREHENSION_OF_CONCURRENT_VIEWPOINTS_OF_URBAN_FABRIC_BASED_ON_GIT","abstract":"The study of urban evolution requires representation and management of concurrent points of view using interoperable standards. An extension to CityGML has been recently proposed (Chaturvedi et al., 2017) to represent urban evolution. In this article, we further extend this work to represent different possible scenarios . The key characteristic of our approach is that it makes the most of existing technologies like version control system so that users can easily work with our proposed extension. Our approach also lets the users add and even modify information to versions and version transitions of scenarios in a given workspace.","authors":["John Samuel","Sylvie Servigne","Gilles Gesqui√®re"],"meta":["September 2018","DOI:10.5194/isprs-annals-IV-4-W6-65-2018"],"references":["324656864_CityGML_30_Sneak_Preview","308416831_Representation_and_Visualization_of_Urban_Fabric_through_Historical_Documents","273650229_VIRTUAL_LEODIUM_FROM_AN_HISTORICAL_3D_CITY_SCALE_MODEL_TO_AN_ARCHAEOLOGICAL_INFORMATION_SYSTEM","267323246_Digital_reconstruction_and_visualization_in_archaeology_Case-study_drawn_from_the_work_of_the_Swedish_Pompeii_Project","259979038_On_the_way_to_a_4D_archaeological_GIS_State_of_the_art_future_directions_and_need_for_standardization","258521116_A_Categorical_Theory_of_Patches","336587153_Projection_Augmented_Relief_Models_PARM_Tangible_Displays_for_Geographic_Information","308866050_Visualization_and_multimedia_presentation_of_cultural_heritage","300589277_Developing_CityGML_Indoor_ADE_to_Manage_Indoor_Facilities","299864831_The_Venice_Time_Machine"]}
