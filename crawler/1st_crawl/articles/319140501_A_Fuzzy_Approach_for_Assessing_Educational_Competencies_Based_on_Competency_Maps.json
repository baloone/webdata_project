{"id":"319140501_A_Fuzzy_Approach_for_Assessing_Educational_Competencies_Based_on_Competency_Maps","abstract":"The use of linguistic terms enables teachers carry out the educational competencies assessment in a natural and significant way. However, the competency maps assessment may be an imprecise task because teachers have to consider a large amount of linguistic information, which describes relationships among elements (i.e., competencies and assessment activities), weights of such relationships and proficiency levels attained by students. In order to address this issue, this work proposes a fuzzy approach for assessing competencies based on the structure and features of the competency maps by using the 2-tuples model. In order to assess the effectiveness and the efficiency in terms of runtime of the proposal, in this work a prototype has been developed and tested using real data provided by teachers, achieving successful results. This approach intends to provide a guide to implement services for assessing educational competencies.","authors":["Diego Duran","Gabriel E.
