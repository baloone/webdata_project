{"id":"340655669_The_value_of_urine_biochemical_parameters_in_the_prediction_of_the_severity_of_coronavirus_disease_2019","abstract":"Background\nAmong patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the cases of a significant proportion of patients are severe. A viral nucleic acid test is used for the diagnosis of COVID-19, and some hematological indicators have been used in the auxiliary diagnosis and identification of the severity of COVID-19. Regarding body fluid samples, except for being used for nucleic acid testing, the relationship between COVID-19 and routine body fluid parameters is not known. Our aim was to investigate the value of urine biochemical parameters in the prediction of the severity of COVID-19.\n\nMethods\nA total of 119 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled at Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. According to the severity of COVID-19, the patients were divided into three groups (moderate 67, severe 42 and critical 10), and 45 healthy persons were enrolled in the same period as healthy controls. The relationship between the results of urine biochemical parameters and the severity of COVID-19 was analyzed.\n\nResults\nThe positive rates of urine occult blood (BLOOD) and proteinuria (PRO) were higher in COVID-19 patients than in healthy controls (p < 0.05); the urine specific gravity (SG) value was lower in patients than in healthy controls (p < 0.05), and the urine potential of hydrogen (pH) value was higher in patients than in healthy controls (p < 0.01). The positive rates of urine glucose (GLU-U) and PRO in the severe and critical groups were higher than those in the moderate group (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively); other biochemical parameters of urine were not associated with the severity of COVID-19.\n\nConclusions\nSome urine biochemical parameters are different between patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 and healthy controls, and GLU-U and PRO may be helpful for the differentiation of COVID-19 severity.","authors":["Rui Liu","Qingfeng Ma","Huan Han","Hanwen Su"],"meta":["April 2020Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine 58(7)","DOI:10.1515/cclm-2020-0220"],"references":["339484038_Characteristics_of_and_Important_Lessons_From_the_Coronavirus_Disease_2019_COVID-19_Outbreak_in_China_Summary_of_a_Report_of_72_314_Cases_From_the_Chinese_Center_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention","339112553_Clinical_Characteristics_of_138_Hospitalized_Patients_With_2019_Novel_Coronavirus-Infected_Pneumonia_in_Wuhan_China","339049644_RNA_based_mNGS_approach_identifies_a_novel_human_coronavirus_from_two_individual_pneumonia_cases_in_2019_Wuhan_outbreak","338904336_Early_Transmission_Dynamics_in_Wuhan_China_of_Novel_Coronavirus-Infected_Pneumonia","338816497_A_Novel_Coronavirus_from_Patients_with_Pneumonia_in_China_2019","338810430_A_familial_cluster_of_pneumonia_associated_with_the_2019_novel_coronavirus_indicating_person-to-person_transmission_a_study_of_a_family_cluster","338806634_Clinical_features_of_patients_infected_with_2019_novel_coronavirus_in_Wuhan_China","221933781_Bacteriuria_Screening_by_Automated_Whole-Field-Image-Based_Microscopy_Reduces_the_Number_of_Necessary_Urine_Cultures","339431940_Is_COVID-19_receiving_ADE_from_other_coronaviruses","339035617_2019_Novel_Coronavirus_2019-nCoV_Pneumonia","338931536_Epidemiological_and_clinical_characteristics_of_99_cases_of_2019_novel_coronavirus_pneumonia_in_Wuhan_China_a_descriptive_study","333936622_Human_Coronavirus_Host-Pathogen_Interaction","318797882_The_Accuracy_of_the_Sysmex_UF-1000_i_in_Urine_Bacterial_Detection_Compared_With_the_Standard_Urine_Analysis_and_Culture","271037059_The_Urine_Dipstick_Test_Useful_to_Rule_Out_Infections_A_Meta-Analysis_of_the_Accuracy"]}
