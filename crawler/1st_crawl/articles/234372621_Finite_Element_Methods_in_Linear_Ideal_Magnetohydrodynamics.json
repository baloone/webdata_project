{"id":"234372621_Finite_Element_Methods_in_Linear_Ideal_Magnetohydrodynamics","abstract":"A finite element approach to the solution of the ideal linear MHD\nequations is presented which provides a way to avoid, through a proper\nchoice of basic functions, unstable spectral approximations in the\nnumerical calculations. The approach proposed here, which uses finite\nhybrid elements, is illustrated by applying it to the calculation beta\nlimits in tokamaks and straight stellarators. The listings of the\ncomputer codes used are included, along with the calculation of the\nballooning mode criterion with finite elements and an efficient\neigenvalue solver making use of the specific matrix structures.","authors":["Ralf Gruber","Jacques Rappaz"],"meta":["January 1985Mathematics of Computation -1(180)","DOI:10.2307/2008337"],"references":[]}
