{"id":"220066167_Exploring_the_Learning_Mechanism_in_Educational_Games","abstract":"The main aim of this paper is to evaluate the problem-based gaming model that tries to explain the learning process in educational games. The model was studied through Geometry game aimed for preschool children (N = 24). The game relays on learning by teaching approach and involves AI-engine modeling the human concept learning structures. The qualitative analyses were used to explore participants' learning processes and gaming strategies. The results indicated that the model well describes the problem-based gaming process in which the reflection phase seems to be a vital factor. Furthermore, the changes in playing strategies were found to enhance learning.","authors":["Kristian Kiili","Harri Ketamo"],"meta":["January 2007Journal of Computing and Information Technology 15(4):319-324","DOI:10.2498/cit.1001139","SourceDBLP"],"references":["250886743_Educational_Game_Models_Conceptualization_and_Evaluation","235701029_Experiential_Learning_Experience_As_The_Source_Of_Learning_And_Development","232444368_Role_of_Guidance_Reflection_and_Interactivity_in_an_Agent-Based_Multimedia_Game","313632455_Designing_educational_computer_games","271787795_Digital_Game-Based_Learning","269495896_The_Psychology_of_Everyday_Things","247958271_The_psychology_of_everyday_things_Basic_Books_Inc","240580035_Computer_Games_Increase_Learning_in_an_Interactive_Multidisciplinary_Environment","239982711_Experience_as_the_Source_of_Learning_and_Development","229457604_Foundation_for_problem-based_gaming"]}
