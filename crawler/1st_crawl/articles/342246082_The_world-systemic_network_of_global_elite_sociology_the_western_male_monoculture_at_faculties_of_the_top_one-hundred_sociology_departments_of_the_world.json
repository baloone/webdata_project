Results show that a significant overrepresentation of central countries and considerable gender bias can be found throughout sociology departments with strong male dominance in high positions. By using an improved word-systemic model for the interpretation of our data, we were able to categorize the main agents and patients in the world-system of global elite sociology, and we could also describe those centripetal and centrifugal forces that absorb and reeducate peripheral talent while excluding those without Western reeducation.","authors":["Marton Demeter","Tamas Toth"],"meta":["June 2020Scientometrics 124(1)","DOI:10.1007/s11192-020-03563-w"],"references":["338038367_Bung_the_gap_narrowing_Global_North_-_Global_South_bias_in_measuring_academic_excellence_by_weighting_with_academic_capital","330181375_Theorizing_international_inequalities_in_communication_and_media_studies_A_field_theory_approach","327217363_The_Winner_Takes_It_All_International_Inequality_in_Communication_and_Media_Studies_Today","326656731_Emergent_structures_in_faculty_hiring_networks_and_the_effects_of_mobility_on_academic_performance","345668588_What_Internationalization_Means_in_the_Social_Sciences_A_Comparison_of_the_International_Political_Science_and_Sociology_Associations","341956655_The_Darker_Side_of_Western_Modernity_Global_Futures_Decolonial_Options","336093971_Academic_Hiring_and_Inequality","330824211_The_Social_and_Human_Sciences_in_Global_Power_Relations","327522796_The_End_of_the_Cognitive_EmpireThe_Coming_of_Age_of_Epistemologies_of_the_South","326604977_On_Decoloniality_Concepts_Analytics_Praxis"]}
