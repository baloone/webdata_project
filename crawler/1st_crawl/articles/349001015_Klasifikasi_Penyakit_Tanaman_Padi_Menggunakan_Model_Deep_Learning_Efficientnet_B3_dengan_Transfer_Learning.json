The slow and inappropriate treatment of rice plant can make the crop failure so that rice production and farmers' income decrease. The symptoms of rice disease are difficult to distinguish, especially in severe symptoms. Collaboration with other fields, especially computer science, is needed to classify diseases automatically so that the farmers can take action for plant treatment and the spread of disease can be controlled quickly. The classification of diseases based on images requires the best features/characteristics so that the disease can be classified. In this research, Deep Learning method, especially Convolutional Neural Network with EfficientNet B3 architecture, can extract features very well. In this research, the classification of brown spot and bacterial leaf disease by applying EfficientNet B3 with transfer learning reached 79.53% accuracy and 0.012 loss/error.","authors":["Endang Anggiratih","Sri Siswanti","Saly Kurnia Octaviani","Arum Sari"],"meta":["January 2021Jurnal Ilmiah SINUS 19(1):75","DOI:10.30646/sinus.v19i1.526"],"references":["334743331_RICE_PLANT_DISEASE_CLASSIFICATION_USING_TRANSFER_LEARNING_OF_DEEP_CONVOLUTION_NEURAL_NETWORK","318437440_Detection_and_classification_of_rice_plant_diseases","343677455_Kombinasi_Ciri_Bentuk_dan_Ciri_Tekstur_Untuk_Identifikasi_Penyakit_Pada_Tanaman_Padi","341845107_Rice_Leaf_Diseases_Classification_Using_CNN_With_Transfer_Learning","340565584_Identification_and_recognition_of_rice_diseases_and_pests_using_convolutional_neural_networks","339561485_Searching_for_MobileNetV3","318082906_Identification_of_Rice_Diseases_using_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks"]}
