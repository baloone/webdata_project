{"id":"278635496_GALILEO_signals_and_payload_optimization","abstract":"The Galileo positioning system is a satellite navigation system, to be built by the European Union (EU) and operational by 2013. To provide high precision position, the Galileo system should present high performance signals and architecture. The signals design, their performance and their generation are the heart of this thesis. Indeed the main objective of this study is the optimization of the Galileo signals and generation to obtain the best performance from a receiver point of view. A thorough analysis of the Galileo system, from the payload to the receiver, is first realized. It shows that impairments can affect the signals during the transmission. To avoid these distortions or to reduce their impact, Galileo signals should present some particular properties. It is therefore important to analyze these constraints for the design of high-performance payload and signals. One of the objectives of this thesis is to study if the proposed Galileo signals, in the E5 and E1 bands, possess these properties and so if they verify the design constraints. To have better performance, recently, new signals waveforms have been proposed to transmit the Galileo Open Service signal in the E1 band. These new waveforms, called Composite BCS or Composite BOC, are examined to verify their compliance to the design constraints. Their performance are evaluated and compared to the baseline BOC(1,1) performance. Finally, simulations results are presented. They permit to evaluate the influence of the distortions due to payload and receiver equipment on Galileo signals and their performance from a receiver point of view.","authors":["Emilie Rebeyrol"],"meta":["October 2007"],"references":[]}
