{"id":"310769577_Planar_triangulations_bridgeless_planar_maps_and_Tamari_intervals","abstract":"We present a direct bijection between planar 3-connected triangulations and bridgeless planar maps, which were first enumerated by Tutte (1962) and Walsh and Lehman (1975) respectively. Previously known bijections by Wormald (1980) and Fusy(2010) are all defined recursively. Our direct bijection passes by a new class of combinatorial objects called \"sticky tree\". We also present bijections between sticky trees, intervals in the Tamari lattices and closed flows on forests. With our bijections, we recover several known enumerative results of these objects.","authors":["Wenjie Fang"],"meta":["May 2018European Journal of Combinatorics 70:75--91","DOI:10.1016/j.ejc.2017.12.002","Project: Bijective relations between Tamari-like intervals and planar maps"],"references":["309693777_The_enumeration_of_generalized_Tamari_intervals","51947206_Higher_Trivariate_Diagonal_Harmonics_via_generalized_Tamari_Posets","267110241_A_Census_of_Planar_Triangulations","266161800_A_correspondence_for_rooted_planar_maps","263163820_An_extension_of_Tamari_lattices","258567143_Two_bijections_on_Tamari_Intervals","245809779_Counting_rooted_maps_by_genus_III_Nonseparable_maps","222219022_New_bijective_links_on_planar_maps_via_orientations","220078464_Intervals_in_Catalan_lattices_and_realizers_of_triangulations","51964773_The_Number_of_Intervals_in_the_m-Tamari_Lattices"]}
