{"id":"329977634_Heterogeneous_Networks_and_Their_Applications_Scientometrics_Name_Disambiguation_and_Topic_Modeling","abstract":"We present heterogeneous networks as a way to unify lexical networks with relational data. We build a unified ACL Anthology network, tying together the citation, author collaboration, and term-cooccurence networks with affiliation and venue relations. This representation proves to be convenient and allows problems such as name disambiguation, topic modeling, and the measurement of scientific impact to be easily solved using only this network and off-the-shelf graph algorithms.","authors":["Ben King","Rahul Jha","Dragomir R.
