{"id":"343648607_The_Optimization_of_the_3-d_Structure_of_Plants_Using_Functional-Structural_Plant_Models_Case_Study_of_Rice_Oryza_sativa_L_in_Indonesia","abstract":"One component of the performance of plants is their capability to intercept light. By using a functional-structural modelling approach, an optimization model of the 3-d above-ground structure of plants is constructed, especially for four Indonesian rice varieties. The constructed model consists of three main clusters: rice plant, skylight, and optimization. Virtual experiments, using the optimization method of \"simulated annealing\", deliver as a result the optimized shape of each rice variety. Twenty-one parameters of rice plant structure are considered in the optimization process.","authors":["Ditdit Nugeraha Utama"],"meta":["December 2015","Thesis for: Doctoral (Dr.rer.nat)Advisor: Kurth, Winfried Prof. Dr."],"references":["337932102_Engineering_Optimization_Theory_and_Practice","321133827_A_Comparison_of_Three_Methods_for_Selecting_Values_of_Input_Variables_in_the_Analysis_of_Output_from_a_Computer_Code","314751171_Introduction_to_Optimization_Methods_and_Their_Application_in_Statistics","313170517_A_modified_particle_swarm_optimizer","308963049_Parallel_Graph_Grammars_with_Instantiation_Rules_Allow_Efficient_Structural_Factorization_of_Virtual_Vegetation","302963206_A_quantitative_analysis_of_plant_form-the_pipe_model_theory_I_Basic_analyses","300289109_Rice_Plant_Growth_and_Development","299822741_Generalized_Additive_Models_An_Introduction_With_R","292753196_Rice_growth_and_development","289161832_Synthetic_and_Maintenance_Respiratory_Losses_of_14CO2_in_Uniculm_Barley_and_Maize"]}
