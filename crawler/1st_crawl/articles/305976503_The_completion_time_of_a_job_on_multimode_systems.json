{"id":"305976503_The_completion_time_of_a_job_on_multimode_systems","abstract":"In this paper we present a general model of the completion time of a single job on a computer system whose state changes according to a semi-Markov process with possibly infinite state-space. When the state of the system changes the job service is preempted. The job service is then resumed or restarted (with or without resampling) in the new state at, possibly, a different service rate. Different types of preemption disciplines are allowed in the model. Successive aggregation and transform techniques are used to obtain the Laplaceâ€“Stieltjes transform of the job completion time. We specialize to the case of Markovian structure-state process. We demonstrate the use of the techniques developed here by means of two applications. In the first we derive the distribution of the response time in an M/M/ 1 queueing system under the processor-sharing discipline (PS). In the second we derive the distribution of the completion time of a job when executed on a system subject to mixed types of breakdowns and repair.","authors":["V. G. Kulkarni","Victor F.
