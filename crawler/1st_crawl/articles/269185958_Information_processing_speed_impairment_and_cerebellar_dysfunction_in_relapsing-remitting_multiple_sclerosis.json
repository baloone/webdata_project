{"id":"269185958_Information_processing_speed_impairment_and_cerebellar_dysfunction_in_relapsing-remitting_multiple_sclerosis","abstract":"The aim of this work is to study the relationship between information processing speed (IPS) impairment and motor testing that reflects cerebellar function in persons with multiple sclerosis (PwMS).\n60 persons with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis with a mean disease duration of 4.2±4years were studied cross-sectionally. Motor cerebellar functioning was studied using the Nine-Hole Peg Test (NHPT) and the Kurtzke Functional Status Scales, and several cognitive domains were evaluated (IPS, working memory, episodic memory, attention, executive function). Correlations between the global NHPT score and neuropsychological test scores or impairment in each cognitive domain were studied using univariate and multivariate analyses.\nThe NHPT and a test of IPS significantly differentiated PwMS with and without cerebellar impairment. The NHPT total score was correlated with measures of IPS. Multivariate analyses showed a correlation between the NHPT and measures of IPS, but not between the NHPT and other neuropsychological tests that did not have a speed component.\nIn this sample of PwMS, motor cerebellar impairment assessed by the NHPT was correlated with IPS impairment.\nCopyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.
