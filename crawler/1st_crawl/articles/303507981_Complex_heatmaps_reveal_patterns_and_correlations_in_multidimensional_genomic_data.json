{"id":"303507981_Complex_heatmaps_reveal_patterns_and_correlations_in_multidimensional_genomic_data","abstract":"Parallel heatmaps with carefully designed annotation graphics are powerful for efficient visualization of patterns and relationships\namong high dimensional genomic data. Here we present the ComplexHeatmap package that provides rich functionalities for customizing heatmaps, arranging multiple parallel heatmaps and including user-defined\nannotation graphics. We demonstrate the power of ComplexHeatmap to easily reveal patterns and correlations among multiple sources of information with four real-world datasets.\n\nAvailability: The ComplexHeatmap package and documentation are freely available from the Bioconductor project: http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/ComplexHeatmap.html.\n\nContact: m.schlesner{at}dkfz.de\nSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","authors":["Zuguang Gu","Roland Eils","Matthias Schlesner"],"meta":["May 2016Bioinformatics 32(18):btw313","DOI:10.1093/bioinformatics/btw313"],"references":["280387831_dendextend_An_R_package_for_visualizing_adjusting_and_comparing_trees_of_hierarchical_clustering","265125716_Comprehensive_molecular_profiling_of_lung_adenocarcinoma_Research_CGA_N_Nature_2014_511_7511_543_50_101038nature13385","232320112_Hotspot_Mutations_in_H3F3A_and_IDH1_Define_Distinct_Epigenetic_and_Biological_Subgroups_of_Glioblastoma","312532307_Integrative_analysis_of_complex_cancer_genomics_and_clinical_profiles_using_the_cBioPortal","285028466_Cluster_analysis_and_display_of_genome-wide_expression_patterns","271140157_Computational_analysis_of_cell-to-cell_heterogeneity_in_single-cell_RNA-Sequencing_data_reveals_hidden_subpopulations_of_cells"]}
