{"id":"271471922_A_performance_study_of_network_migration_to_SDN-enabled_Traffic_Engineering","abstract":"In this paper, we analyze the question of network migration to Software Defined Networking (SDN) from the perspective of Traffic Engineering (TE). For a given network topology and migration planning horizon, we ask the question of which routers in the IP network should migrate to SDN-enabled operation to reduce the need for network capacity upgrades over a given time horizon. We propose an algorithm to determine the optimum schedule for node substitution within a network, which shows that already a few SDN routers, when strategically located, provide a stably large number of path alternatives to be used in TE, thus substantially reducing the need for large network capacity upgrades.","authors":["Marcel Caria","Admela Jukan","Marco Hoffmann"],"meta":["December 2013","DOI:10.1109/GLOCOM.2013.6831268","Conference: GLOBECOM 2013 - 2013 IEEE Global Communications Conference"],"references":["254464083_The_Controller_Placement_Problem","224249745_Impact_and_Handling_of_Demand_Uncertainty_in_Multiperiod_Planned_Networks","269571398_Strategic_planning_of_optical_telecommunication_networks_in_a_dynamic_and_uncertain_environment","261313115_Why_OpenFlowSDN_can_succeed_where_GMPLS_failed","260708200_On_scalability_of_software-defined_networking","224169881_Network_migration_using_ant_colony_optimization","3076583_Adoption_Timing_of_New_Equipment_with_Another_Innovation_Anticipated"]}
