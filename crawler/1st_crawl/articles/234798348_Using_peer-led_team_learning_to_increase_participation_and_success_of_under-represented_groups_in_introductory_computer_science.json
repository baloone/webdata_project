{"id":"234798348_Using_peer-led_team_learning_to_increase_participation_and_success_of_under-represented_groups_in_introductory_computer_science","abstract":"This paper describes the implementation and evaluation of a program that uses active recruiting and peer-led team learning to try to increase the participation and success of women and minority students in undergraduate computer science. These strategies were applied at eight universities starting in the fall of 2004. There have been some impressive results: We succeeded in attracting under-represented students who would not otherwise have taken a CS course. Evaluation shows that participation in our program significantly improves retention rates and grades, especially for women. Students in the program, as well as the students who served as peer leaders, are uniformly enthusiastic about their experience.","authors":["Susan Horwitz","Susan H.
