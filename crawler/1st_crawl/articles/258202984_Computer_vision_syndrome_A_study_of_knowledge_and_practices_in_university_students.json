The prevalence of symptoms of CVS (one or more) was found to be 89.9%; the most disturbing symptom was headache (19.7%) followed by eye strain (16.4%). Students who used computer for more than 2 hours per day experienced significantly more symptoms of CVS (p=0.0001). Looking at far objects in-between the work was significantly (p=0.0008) associated with less frequency of CVS symptoms. The use of radiation filter on the screen (p=0.6777) did not help in reducing the CVS symptoms.\n\nConclusion: \nNinety percent of university students in Malaysia experienced symptoms related to CVS, which was seen more often in those who used computer for more than 2 hours continuously per day.","authors":["Sagili Chandrasekhara Reddy","C K Low","YP Lim","L L Low"],"meta":["July 2013Nepalese journal of ophthalmology : a biannual peer-reviewed academic journal of the Nepal Ophthalmic Society : NEPJOPH 5(10):161-8","DOI:10.3126/nepjoph.v5i2.8707","SourcePubMed"],"references":["272337402_Visual_Symptoms_Among_Non-presbyopic_Video_Display_Tterminal_VDT_Operators_In_Owerri_Nigeria","251719391_Visual_problems_among_video_display_terminal_VDT_users_in_Nepal","14444217_Risk_factors_for_asthenopia_among_computer_terminal_operators","14317819_Is_computer_use_a_risk_factor_for_myopia","12560071_Posture_discomfort_and_performance_in_a_VDT_task","11945902_Computer_terminal_work_and_the_benefit_of_microbreaks","313563413_Visual_and_ocular_symptoms_related_to_the_use_of_video_display_terminals","274690110_Computer_vision_syndrome","242313296_DOCTOR_ERGO_CVS_DOCTORS_MEETING_THE_EYE_CARE_NEEDS_OF_COMPUTER_USERS","227758439_Association_between_duration_of_daily_VDT_use_and_subjective_symptoms","27463490_Symptoms_associated_with_VDT_use","21724459_Vision_problems_at_video_display_terminals_a_survey_of_optometrists","15924208_An_Investigation_of_Health_Complaints_and_Job_Stress_in_Video_Display_Operations","15181841_Eye_discomfort_and_work_with_visual_display_terminals","14336781_Effect_of_VDUs_on_the_Eyes_Report_of_a_6-Year_Epidemiological_Study","13593276_Eye_problems_and_visual_display_terminals_-_The_facts_and_the_fallacies","11881091_A_field_evaluation_of_monitor_placement_effects_in_VDT_users","10663505_Do_video_display_units_cause_visual_problems_-_a_bedside_story_about_the_processes_of_public_health_decision-making","9020834_Comparative_randomized_controlled_clinical_trial_of_a_herbal_eye_drop_with_artificial_tear_and_placebo_in_computer_vision_syndrome","8920988_Effect_of_Povidone_2_Preservative-free_Eyedrops_on_Contact_Lens_Wearers_With_Computer_Visual_Syndrome","8048919_Effects_of_two_eye_drop_products_on_computer_users_with_subjective_ocular_discomfort","7886681_Computer_Vision_Syndrome_A_Review","7515812_Visual_effects_of_the_luminance_surrounding_a_computer_display","5691712_A_community-based_study_of_asthenopia_in_computer_operators"]}
