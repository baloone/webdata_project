An experiential learning approach has been designed to assist students in web development courses. The proposed learning approach in based on real-world examples and the abstraction of terminology using a sequential wizard-based logic. A survey model has been constructed and an exploratory study is conducted on 54 under and post graduate students. Results demonstrated high degree of perception and acceptance, as well as high performance scores. No gender differences have been detected in the examined sample and several strong correlations have been found among the measured variables. In particular, perceived ease of use and usefulness are strongly correlated to each other as well as to self-efficacy, willingness to learn and satisfaction. Satisfaction and self-efficacy are not correlated to each other, while performance has not been affected by anyone of the measured variables.","authors":["Katerina Tzafilkou","Nicolaos Protogeros","Manto Chouliara"],"meta":["November 2020Education and Information Technologies 25(5)","DOI:10.1007/s10639-020-10211-6"],"references":["320533852_Mobile_Game-Based_Learning_with_a_Mobile_App_Motivational_Effects_and_Learning_Performance","319307819_Examining_gender_issues_in_perception_and_acceptance_in_web-based_end-user_development_activities","319244155_Experiential_Learning_in_Data_Science_From_the_Dataset_Repository_to_the_Platform_of_Experiences","305519149_Gender-based_behavioral_analysis_for_end-user_development_and_the_'RULES'_attributes","284283645_Engaging_end-users_in_creating_data-intensive_mobile_applications_A_creative_'e-learning-by-doing'_approach","283780932_Supporting_Student_Learning_in_Computer_Science_Education_via_the_Adaptive_Learning_Environment_ALMA","277934491_Experiential_Learning_Empowering_Students_to_Take_Control_of_Their_Learning_by_Engaging_Them_in_an_Interactive_Course_Simulation_Environment","309456367_An_Analysis_of_Variance_Test_for_Normality_Complete_Samples","308565813_Making_an_impact_through_experiential_learning","283720548_Making_an_Impact_through_Experiential_Learning","276859377_Interactive_e-learning_through_Second_Life_with_Blackboard_Technology","275543945_Interactive_and_Creative_Learning_of_the_Adults","275068070_Fostering_the_Creative_Development_of_Computer_Science_Students_in_Programming_and_Interaction_Design","259127180_Using_Kolb's_Experiential_Learning_Cycle_to_improve_student_learning_in_virtual_computer_laboratories","258010206_Teaching_Computer_Science_to_Young_Children_through_Creativity_Lessons_Learned_from_the_Case_of_Norway"]}
