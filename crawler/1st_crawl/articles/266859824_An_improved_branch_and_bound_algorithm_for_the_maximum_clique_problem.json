{"id":"266859824_An_improved_branch_and_bound_algorithm_for_the_maximum_clique_problem","abstract":"A new algorithm for finding a maximum clique in an undirected graph is described. An approximate coloring algorithm has been improved and used to provide bounds to the size of the maximum clique in a basic algorithm which finds a maximum clique. This basic algorithm was then extended to include dynamically varying bounds. The resulting algorithm is significantly faster than the comparable algorithm.","authors":["Janez Konc","Dušanka Janežić"],"meta":["January 2007MATCH Communications in Mathematical and in Computer Chemistry 58(3)"],"references":["220224533_Weighted_and_Unweighted_Maximum_Clique_Algorithms_with_Upper_Bounds_from_Fractional_Coloring","270850329_A_New_Algorithm_for_the_Maximum-Weight_Clique_Problem","266510117_Some_heuristics_for_graph_colouring","228057735_Computers_And_Intractability_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness","222569087_Clique-detection_models_in_computational_biochemistry_and_genomics","222490637_An_algorithm_for_finding_a_maximum_clique_in_a_graph_Operations_Res_Lett_21_211-217","222200537_A_fast_algorithm_for_the_maximum_clique_problem_Discrete_Appl_Math_120_197-207","221157305_A_Branch_and_Bound_Algorithm_for_Matching_Protein_Structures","220081003_A_New_Algorithm_For_The_Maximum-Weight_Clique_Problem","216877595_An_efficient_branch-and-bound_algorithm_for_finding_a_maximum_clique"]}
