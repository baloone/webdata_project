{"id":"337456669_Solving_Integer_Linear_Programs_by_Exploiting_Variable-Constraint_Interactions_A_Survey","abstract":"Integer Linear Programming (ILP) is among the most successful and general paradigms for solving computationally intractable optimization problems in computer science. ILP is NP-complete, and until recently we have lacked a systematic study of the complexity of ILP through the lens of variable-constraint interactions. This changed drastically in recent years thanks to a series of results that together lay out a detailed complexity landscape for the problem centered around the structure of graphical representations of instances. The aim of this survey is to summarize these recent developments, put them into context and a unified format, and make them more approachable for experts from many diverse backgrounds.","authors":["Robert Ganian","Sebastian Ordyniak"],"meta":["November 2019Algorithms 12(12):248","DOI:10.3390/a12120248"],"references":["318830060_Solving_Integer_Linear_Programs_with_a_Small_Number_of_Global_Variables_and_Constraints","346021562_Integer_Programming_and_Incidence_Treedepth","326207090_Unary_Integer_Linear_Programming_with_Structural_Restrictions","322320058_The_Complexity_Landscape_of_Decompositional_Parameters_for_ILP","314292996_Discovering_Archipelagos_of_Tractability_for_Constraint_Satisfaction_and_Counting","304642465_Clique-Width_and_Directed_Width_Measures_for_Answer-Set_Programming","303754470_A_ckn_5-APPROXIMATION_ALGORITHM_FOR_TREEWIDTH","277473416_A_Linear-Time_Algorithm_for_Finding_Tree-Decompositions_of_Small_Treewidth","267000461_Sparsity_Graphs_Structures_and_Algorithms","265533484_The_Vehicle_Routing_Problem"]}
