{"id":"336379501_DC3_is_a_method_for_deconvolution_and_coupled_clustering_from_bulk_and_single-cell_genomics_data","abstract":"Characterizing and interpreting heterogeneous mixtures at the cellular level is a critical problem in genomics. Single-cell assays offer an opportunity to resolve cellular level heterogeneity, e.g., scRNA-seq enables single-cell expression profiling, and scATAC-seq identifies active regulatory elements. Furthermore, while scHi-C can measure the chromatin contacts (i.e., loops) between active regulatory elements to target genes in single cells, bulk HiChIP can measure such contacts in a higher resolution. In this work, we introduce DC3 (De-Convolution and Coupled-Clustering) as a method for the joint analysis of various bulk and single-cell data such as HiChIP, RNA-seq and ATAC-seq from the same heterogeneous cell population. DC3 can simultaneously identify distinct subpopulations, assign single cells to the subpopulations (i.e., clustering) and de-convolve the bulk data into subpopulation-specific data. The subpopulation-specific profiles of gene expression, chromatin accessibility and enhancer-promoter contact obtained by DC3 provide a comprehensive characterization of the gene regulatory system in each subpopulation.","authors":["Wanwen Zeng","Xi Chen","Zhana Duren","Yong Wang"],"meta":["October 2019Nature Communications 10(1):1-11","DOI:10.1038/s41467-019-12547-1"],"references":["327635071_A_Single-Cell_Transcriptional_Atlas_of_the_Developing_Murine_Cerebellum","326813467_A_single-cell_atlas_of_the_airway_epithelium_reveals_the_CFTR-rich_pulmonary_ionocyte","326277732_Integrative_analysis_of_single-cell_genomics_data_by_coupled_nonnegative_matrix_factorizations","325878950_Unsupervised_clustering_and_epigenetic_classification_of_single_cells","323781719_The_cis-regulatory_dynamics_of_embryonic_development_at_single-cell_resolution","339647316_Model-Based_Approach_to_the_Joint_Analysis_of_Single-Cell_Data_on_Chromatin_Accessibility_and_Gene_Expression","327332922_Joint_profiling_of_chromatin_accessibility_and_gene_expression_in_thousands_of_single_cells","326798234_A_Single-Cell_Atlas_of_In_Vivo_Mammalian_Chromatin_Accessibility","323460340_Hichipper_A_preprocessing_pipeline_for_calling_DNA_loops_from_HiChIP_data","323438336_The_role_of_Pax6_in_brain_development_and_its_impact_on_pathogenesis_of_autism_spectrum_disorder"]}
