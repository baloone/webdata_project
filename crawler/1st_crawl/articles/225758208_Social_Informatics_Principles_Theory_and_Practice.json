{"id":"225758208_Social_Informatics_Principles_Theory_and_Practice","abstract":"Through this paper we make two contributions to social informatics: the interdisciplinary study of the design, development,\nuses and consequences of information and communication technologies that takes into account their interaction with institutional\nand cultural contexts. Our first contribution is to make a connection from social informatics to general principles of socio-technical\ntheories. We do this to both connect social informatics scholarship more directly to the large and growing literature(s) that\nengage socio-technical theorizing and to advance these principles more directly through social informatics. Our second contribution\nto social informatics is to engage two contemporary theoretical approaches that draw on social informatics principles: socio-technical\ninteraction networks and principles of social actors and apply them to current practice. We do so to demonstrate that these\nanalytic approaches are the needed tools to help scholars and reflective professionals in practice engage social informatics\nanalyses. By doing this we highlight the potential of social informatics while honouring Rob Klingâ€™s legacy in helping to\nestablish this transdiscipline.","authors":["Steve Sawyer","Michael Tyworth"],"meta":["January 2007","DOI:10.1007/978-0-387-37876-3_4","SourceOAI","Conference: IFIP International Conference on Human Choice and Computers"],"references":["303990383_The_911_Commission_Report_Final_Report_of_the_National_Commission_on_Terrorist_Attacks_upon_the_United_States","299177216_Criminal_justice_and_the_IT_revolution","275696920_Abusing_Science_the_Case_against_Creationism","270591664_Information_Systems_as_a_Reference_Discipline","267921989_The_Duality_of_Technology_Rethinking_the_Concept_of_Technology_in_Organizations","250916012_Programmed_Innovation_Trajectories_of_Change_in_Software_Development","249885575_STUDYING_INFORMATION_TECHNOLOGY_IN_ORGANIZATIONS","248876599_Information_Technology_and_the_Criminal_Justice_System","245153884_Abusing_Science_The_Case_Against_Creationism","240357719_Believing_what_we_cannot_prove","234804804_Mobility_and_the_first_responder","240260229_Institutions_and_Organizations","238625809_Public_Knowledge_An_Essay_Concerning_the_Social_Dimensions_of_Science","229583855_Analytic_myopia_data_disintegration_and_homeland_insecurity","222391177_Learning_by_Trying_The_Implementation_of_Configurational_Technology"]}
