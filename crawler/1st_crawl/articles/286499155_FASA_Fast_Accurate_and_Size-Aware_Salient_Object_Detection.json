{"id":"286499155_FASA_Fast_Accurate_and_Size-Aware_Salient_Object_Detection","abstract":"Fast and accurate salient-object detectors are important for various image processing and computer vision applications, such as adaptive compression and object segmentation. It is also desirable to have a detector that is aware of the position and the size of the salient objects. In this paper, we propose a salient-object detection method that is fast, accurate, and size-aware. For efficient computation, we quantize the image colors and estimate the spatial positions and sizes of the quantized colors. We then feed these values into a statistical model to obtain a probability of saliency. In order to estimate the final saliency, this probability is combined with a global color contrast measure. We test our method on two public datasets and show that our method significantly outperforms the fast state-of-the-art methods. In addition, it has comparable performance and is an order of magnitude faster than the accurate state-of-the-art methods. We exhibit the potential of our algorithm by processing a high-definition video in real time.","authors":["Gökhan Yildirim","Sabine Süsstrunk"],"meta":["November 2014","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-16811-1_34","Conference: Asian Conference on Computer Vision"],"references":["286404956_BING_Binarized_Normed_Gradients_for_Objectness_Estimation_at_300fps","261263538_Saliency_Detection_via_Graph-Based_Manifold_Ranking","257959398_Efficient_Salient_Region_Detection_with_Soft_Image_Abstraction","225158955_Cascaded_Confidence_Filtering_for_Improved_Tracking-by-Detection","224254743_Global_Contrast_Based_Salient_Region_Detection","221361790_AHUJA_N_Real-time_O1_bilateral_filtering","220182700_Learning_to_Detect_a_Salient_Object","7483794_MCMC-based_particle_filtering_for_tracking_a_variable_number_of_interacting_targets","4260079_Image_Segmentation_by_Probabilistic_Bottom-Up_Aggregation_and_Cue_Integration","3192913_A_Model_of_Saliency-based_Visual_Attention_for_Rapid_Scene_Analysis","313390811_Global_contrast_based_salient_region_detection","286980217_Frequency-tuned_salient_region_detection","262282856_Salient_Object_Detection_A_Benchmark","261116250_Saliency_Filters_Contrast_Based_Filtering_for_Salient_Region_Detection","245684420_Cognitive_Psychology_and_Its_Implication","224114849_Saliency_Detection_for_Content-aware_Image_Resizing","221750789_Measuring_the_Objectness_of_Image_Windows","221572625_Video_retargeting_for_aesthetic_enhancement","221127204_Top-down_control_of_visual_attention_in_object_detection","221111840_Non-homogeneous_Content-driven_Video-retargeting","220267258_Visual_attention_detection_in_video_sequences_using_spatiotemporal_cues","37468806_Frequency-tuned_Salient_Region_Detection","8253693_Automatic_Foveation_for_Video_Compression_Using_a_Neurobiological_Model_of_Visual_Attention"]}
