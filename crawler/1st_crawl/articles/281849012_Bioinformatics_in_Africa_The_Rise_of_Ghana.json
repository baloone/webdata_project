{"id":"281849012_Bioinformatics_in_Africa_The_Rise_of_Ghana","abstract":"Until recently, bioinformatics, an important discipline in the biological sciences, was largely limited to countries with advanced scientific resources. Nonetheless, several developing countries have lately been making progress in bioinformatics training and applications. In Africa, leading countries in the discipline include South Africa, Nigeria, and Kenya. However, one country that is less known when it comes to bioinformatics is Ghana. Here, I provide a first description of the development of bioinformatics activities in Ghana and how these activities contribute to the overall development of the discipline in Africa. Over the past decade, scientists in Ghana have been involved in publications incorporating bioinformatics analyses, aimed at addressing research questions in biomedical science and agriculture. Scarce research funding and inadequate training opportunities are some of the challenges that need to be addressed for Ghanaian scientists to continue developing their expertise in bioinformatics.","authors":["Thomas K Karikari"],"meta":["September 2015PLoS Computational Biology 11(9):e1004308","DOI:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004308"],"references":["347413920_Ten_cheers_for_interdisciplinarity_The_case_for_interdisciplinary_knowledge_and_research","290891419_Gapped_BLAST_and_PSIBLAST_A_new_generation_of_protein_database_search_programs","280880835_Research_capacity_Enabling_the_genomic_revolution_in_Africa","280682740_Neurogenomics_An_opportunity_to_integrate_neuroscience_genomics_and_bioinformatics_research_in_Africa","279202100_Neurogenomics_Challenges_and_opportunities_for_Ghana","278047450_Building_sustainable_neuroscience_capacity_in_Africa_The_role_of_non-profit_organisations","276063486_Letter_to_the_editor","268050544_Research_capacity_Enabling_the_genomic_revolution_in_Africa_Science_2014_344_1346_1348_101126science1251546","267743838_Mapping_the_distribution_of_maize_streak_virus_genotypes_across_the_forest_and_transition_zones_of_Ghana","287773356_Current_status_and_future_perspectives_of_bioinformatics_in_Tanzania"]}
