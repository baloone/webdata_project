{"id":"356263846_Artificial_Intelligence_in_Forensic_Science","abstract":"Artificial intelligence (AI) is a significant and well-established branch of current computer science that may frequently give a way of addressing computationally massive or difficult issues in a reasonable time period. Digital forensics is a growing field in computing that frequently necessitates the cognitive examination of massive volumes of complicated data.\n\nAs a result, it appears that AI is an appropriate technique for dealing with many of the present difficulties in digital forensics. The goal of this study is to provide a high-level overview of AI as it may be applied in digital forensics.","authors":["Kamshad Mohsin"],"meta":["January 2021SSRN Electronic Journal","DOI:10.2139/ssrn.3910244"],"references":["324985392_Artificial_Intelligence_in_Forensic_Science","287562118_The_use_of_Artificial_Intelligence_in_digital_forensics_An_introduction"]}
