{"id":"319447242_Project-based_learning_in_out-of-class_activities_flipped_learning_based_on_communities_created_in_real_and_virtual_spaces","abstract":"This study focuses on the possibility of students creating communities in both real space (unoccupied classrooms) and virtual space using collaborative software. In the summer of 2016, a project-based learning initiative was launched to revitalise an unoccupied classroom in University of Marketing and Distribution Sciences; four first-year undergraduate students were selected to plan attractive events involving students across academic years and nationalities. Because it was conducted as an out-of-class learning experience, students, as coordinators, had to overcome space and time limitations in facilitating their projects. The qualitative data collected from interviews show the condition under which communities created in real and virtual spaces contribute for involving students in the revitalisation of the unoccupied classroom.","authors":["Kaori Yamashita","Hidetoshi Yasueda"],"meta":["December 2017Procedia Computer Science 112:1044-1053","DOI:10.1016/j.procs.2017.08.108"],"references":["312056149_Flipped_Classroom_with_Problem_Based_Activities_Exploring_Self-regulated_Learning_in_a_Programming_Language_Course"]}
