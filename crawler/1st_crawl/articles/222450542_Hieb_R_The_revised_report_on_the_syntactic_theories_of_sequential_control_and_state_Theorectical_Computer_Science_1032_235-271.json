Unlike the simple λυ-calculus, the extended theories are mixtures of equivalence relations and compatible congruence relations on the term language, which significantly complicates the reasoning process. In this paper we develop fully compatible equational theories of the same imperative higher-order programming languages. The new theories subsume the original calculi of control and state and satisfy the usual Church–Rosser and Standardization Theorems. With the new calculi, equational reasoning about imperative programs becomes as simple as reasoning about functional programs.","authors":["Matthias Felleisen","Robert Hieb"],"meta":["September 1992Theoretical Computer Science 103(2):235-271","DOI:10.1016/0304-3975(92)90014-7","SourceCiteSeer"],"references":["234797955_Revised_Report_on_the_Algorithmic_Language_Scheme","231932704_Explicit_Substitutions","227098423_Scheme_A_Interpreter_for_Extended_Lambda_Calculus","220997088_Making_Variables_Abstract_An_Equational_Theory_for_Russell","3501201_Axiomatizing_Operational_Equivalence_in_the_presence_of_Side_Effects","2711082_Programming_Transforming_and_Proving_with_Function_Abstractions_and_Memories","2339228_A_Sound_and_Complete_Axiomatization_of_Operational_Equivalence_between_Programs_with_Memory","272294886_Control_operators_the_SECD-machine_and_the_lambda-calculus","267007047_The_lambda_calculus_Its_syntax_and_semantics_Rev_ed","266249757_The_next_700_programming_languages","258990729_Common_Lisp_The_Language","256437037_The_Definition_of_Standard_ML","242435377_The_Lambda_Calculus_Its_Syntax_and_Semantics","239590169_Equivalences_of_first-order_lisp_programs","236403699_Calculi_of_lambda-nu-CS_conversion_a_syntactic_theory_of_control_and_state_in_imperative_higher-order_programming_languages","235091848_The_Essence_of_Rum_A_Theory_of_the_Intensional_and_Extensional_Aspects_of_Lisp-Type_Computation","227301513_Rum_an_intensional_theory_of_function_and_control_abstractions","223213797_A_syntactic_theory_of_sequential_control","222120495_Call-by-name_call-by-value_and_the_l-calculus","220997548_The_Theory_and_Practice_of_First-Class_Prompts","220155272_A_Syntactic_Theory_of_Sequential_State","213882365_Control_operators_the_SECD-machine_and_the_lambda-calculus","213877823_The_Mechanical_Evaluation_of_Expressions","3501195_Computational_lambda-calculus_and_monads"]}
