{"id":"344501236_INVESTIGATION_OF_MACHINE_LEARNING_AND_IOT_APPLICATION_IN_HEALTHCARE","abstract":"The fields of computer science and electronics are combined to result one of the most prominent technological advances in the form of realization of the Internet of Things (IoT). Among many of applications enabled by the Internet of Things (IoT), smart and connected health care is a particularly important one. The impact of IoT in healthcare, although still in its early stages of development has been significant. Networked sensors, either worn on the body or embedded in our living environments, make possible the gathering of rich information indicative of our physical and mental health. This paper tries to review and comprehend the applications of IoT in custom-made healthcare to achieve excellent healthcare at affordable costs. We have explained in brief what IoT is, how it functions and how it is used in combination with wireless and sensing techniques to implement the desired healthcare applications. Here, we highlighted the opportunities and challenges for IoT in realizing the vision of the future of health care.","authors":["Anurag Sinha"],"meta":["October 2020"],"references":["220220622_Internet_of_Things_Services_and_Applications_Categorization_Abstract","31208039_Dangerization_and_the_End_of_Deviance_The_Institutional_Environment","262287199_RFID_security_in_the_context_of_internet_of_things"]}
