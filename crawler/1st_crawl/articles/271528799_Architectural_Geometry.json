{"id":"271528799_Architectural_Geometry","abstract":"Geometry lies at the core of the architectural design process. It is omnipresent, from the initial form-finding stages to the actual construction. Modern constructive geometry provides a variety of tools for the efficient design, analysis, and manufacture of complex shapes. This results in new challenges for architecture. However, the architectural application also poses new problems to geometry. Architectural geometry is therefore an entire research area, currently emerging at the border between applied geometry and architecture. This book has been written as a textbook for students of architecture or industrial design. It comprises material at all levels, from the basics of geometric modeling to the cutting edge of research.","authors":["Helmut Pottmann","Andreas Asperl","Michael Hofer","Axel Kilian"],"meta":["October 2007","Publisher: Bentley Institute PressEditor: Daril BentleyISBN: 9781934493045","Project: Architectural Geometry"],"references":[]}
