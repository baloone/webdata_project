{"id":"270792401_Impacts_of_three_MMC-HVDC_configurations_on_AC_system_stability_under_DC_line_faults","abstract":"This paper analyzes the dc line fault transient stability characteristics of AC/DC power systems with three different modular multilevel converter based high voltage direct current (MMC-HVDC) configurations. The first configuration is half bridge sub-module based MMC (H-MMC) HVDC configuration, which clears dc line faults by tripping the ac circuit breakers. The clamp double sub-module (CDSM) based MMC (C-MMC) HVDC configuration with dc line fault clearance ability constitutes the second configuration. A line-commutated converter (LCC) and MMC hybrid HVDC configuration with dc line fault clearance ability, named LCC-diode-MMC (LCC-D-MMC), is the third configuration. The detailed processes of clearing dc line faults in three MMC-HVDC configurations are analyzed. The equal area criterion is utilized to analyze the dc line fault transient processes. Besides, to evaluate the power system transient stability characteristics in three MMC-HVDC configurations, an index, called critical ac transmitted power (Pac_critical), is proposed. Under the same dc line to ground fault, transient stability characteristics of three test systems based on the three different MMC-HVDC configurations are compared. Excellent performance of the LCC-D-MMC HVDC configuration under the dc line fault is demonstrated through comparison of Pac_critical in the three test systems. Finally, the study is extended to a modified New England 39-bus system, and the simulation results also correspond with the theoretical analysis.","authors":["Geng Tang","Zheng Xu","Yuzhi Zhou"],"meta":["November 2014Power Systems, IEEE Transactions on 29(6):3030-3040","DOI:10.1109/TPWRS.2014.2315666"],"references":["260698139_A_Hybrid_Modular_Multilevel_Voltage_Source_Converter_for_HVDC_Power_Transmission","224223722_A_new_hybrid_multi-level_Voltage-Source_Converter_with_DC_fault_blocking_capability","345319535_HVDC_and_FACTS_Controllers_Applications_of_Static_Converters_in_Power_Systems","318412769_Improved_Two-Level_Voltage_Source_Converter_for_High-Voltage_Direct_Current_Transmission_Systems","289127162_Analysis_of_Dual-Infeed_HVDC_with_LCC-HVDC_and_VSC-HVDC","260722122_Self-Start_control_with_grouping_sequentially_precharge_for_the_C-MMC-Based_HVDC_System","260509461_Improving_Performance_of_Multi-Infeed_HVDC_Systems_Using_Grid_Dynamic_Segmentation_Technique_Based_on_Fault_Current_Limiters","260509413_A_Flexible_Power_Control_Method_of_VSC-HVDC_Link_for_the_Enhancement_of_Effective_Short-Circuit_Ratio_in_a_Hybrid_Multi-Infeed_HVDC_System","252029849_Design_and_Simulation_of_a_Modular_Multi-Level_Converter_for_MVDC_Application","239766301_Correction_to_analysis_of_dual-infeed_HVDC_with_LCC-HVDC_and_VSC-HVDC","239766300_Detailed_and_averaged_models_for_a_401-level_MMC-HVDC_system","224398260_Ultra_High_Voltage_Transmission_in_China_Developments_Current_Status_and_Future_Prospects","224245336_Modular_Multilevel_Converter_topologies_with_DC-Short_circuit_current_limitation","224211650_HVDC_Circuit_Breakers_A_Review_Identifying_Future_Research_Needs","224060853_Operational_Mechanism_and_Characteristic_Analysis_of_Novel_Hybrid_HVDC_system","4152694_Research_on_hybrid_HVDC","3438511_The_ABCs_of_HVDC_transmission_technologies"]}
