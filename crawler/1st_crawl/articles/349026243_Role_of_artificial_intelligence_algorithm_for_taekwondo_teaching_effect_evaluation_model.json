{"id":"349026243_Role_of_artificial_intelligence_algorithm_for_taekwondo_teaching_effect_evaluation_model","abstract":"The problems and disadvantages of the traditional teaching mode of Taekwondo in colleges and universities are obvious, which is not conducive to cultivating the interest of contemporary college students in learning Taekwondo. In order to improve the teaching effect of Taekwondo, based on the intelligent algorithm of human body feature recognition, this study uses support vector machine to construct a Taekwondo teaching effect evaluation model based on artificial intelligence algorithm. The model corrects the movement of the students by recognizing the movement characteristics of the studentsâ€™ Taekwondo and can conduct the movement guidance and exercises through the simulation method. In order to verify the performance of the model in this study, this study set up control experiments and mathematical statistical methods to verify the performance of the model. The research results show that the model proposed in this paper has a certain effect and can be applied to teaching practice","authors":["Liang Hailong"],"meta":["February 2021Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems 40(2):3239-3250","DOI:10.3233/JIFS-189364"],"references":["334674147_Screen-Based_Sports_Simulation_Using_Acoustic_Source_Localization","333659326_Musculoskeletal_Simulation_Tools_for_Understanding_Mechanisms_of_Lower-Limb_Sports_Injuries","329031966_Challenging_Conventional_Paradigms_in_Applied_Sports_Biomechanics_Research","324798474_Intensification_of_the_education_of_public_health_hygiene_and_martial_arts_during_the_Japanese_colonial_period_1937-1945","319993589_Optimizing_robot_path_in_dynamic_environments_using_Genetic_Algorithm_and_Bezier_Curve","313824036_Systemic_approach_and_mathematical_modeling_in_physical_education_and_sports","309463633_Computer_simulation_of_Junior_gymnasts'_training_process","306523281_Big_data_and_tactical_analysis_in_elite_soccer_future_challenges_and_opportunities_for_sports_science","305895864_Baseball_Catching_Patterns_Differ_According_to_Task_Constraints","288855763_Physical_Education_Teacher's_Training_in_Swimming_under_the_Joint_Didactic_Action","286040027_A_Community-Engaged_Approach_to_Translating_Research_into_Practice_A_Physical_Education_Story","278912840_Teaching_Practices_and_Student_Action_in_Physical_Education_Classes_Perspectives_for_Teacher_Education","277651476_Body_Practices_and_Brazilian_Culture_Pedagogical_Contributions_to_Physical_Education_Professionals","337303213_A_bonded_channel_in_cognitive_wireless_body_area_network_based_on_IEEE_802156_and_internet_of_things","312426284_Sports_vision_training_A_review_of_the_state-of-the-art_in_digital_training_techniques","282516049_The_Effect_of_High-Fidelity_Cardiopulmonary_Resuscitation_CPR_Simulation_on_Athletic_Training_Student_Knowledge_Confidence_Emotions_and_Experiences","277408507_An_action-incongruent_secondary_task_modulates_prediction_accuracy_in_experienced_performers_evidence_for_motor_simulation","275663388_The_Internal_and_External_Responses_to_a_Forward-Specific_Rugby_League_Simulation_Protocol_Performed_With_and_Without_Physical_Contact","274260347_How_Kinesthetic_Motor_Imagery_Works_A_Predictive-Processing_Theory_of_Visualization_in_Sports_and_Motor_Expertise","269176108_The_evaluation_of_new_multi-material_human_soft_tissue_simulants_for_sports_impact_surrogates","262692363_Competitive_balance_measures_in_sports_leagues_The_effects_of_variation_in_season_length"]}
