{"id":"221010711_Fast_Arithmetic_on_Jacobians_of_Picard_Curves","abstract":"In this paper we present a fast addition algorithm in the Jacobian of a Picard curve over a finite field \n\n\\mathbb F q\\mathbb F _q of characteristic different from 3. This algorithm has a nice geometric interpretation, comparable to the classic ”chord\nand tangent” law for the elliptic curves. Computational cost for addition is 144M + 12SQ + 2I and 158M + 16SQ + 2I for doubling.","authors":["Stéphane Flon","Roger Oyono"],"meta":["March 2004Lecture Notes in Computer Science 2947:55-68","DOI:10.1007/978-3-540-24632-9_5","SourceDBLP","Conference: Public Key Cryptography - PKC 2004, 7th International Workshop on Theory and Practice in Public Key Cryptography, Singapore, March 1-4, 2004"],"references":["239062808_Fast_Genus_Three_Hyperelliptic_Curve_Cryptosystems","221355411_Use_of_Elliptic_Curves_in_Cryptography","220576551_Arithmetic_on_superelliptic_curves","2812617_Elliptic_Curves_and_their_use_in_Cryptography","316800400_Graduate_Texts_in_Mathematics","316799420_Graduate_Texts_in_Mathematics","316790955_Tata_Lectures_on_Theta_I","316072195_Elliptic_Curve_Cryptosystems","266954227_The_Arithmetic_of_Elliptic_Curves","265681769_Elliptic_Curve_Cryptosystems","265445900_Jacobian_Varieties","265370415_Efficient_Reduction_on_the_Jacobian_Variety_of_Picard_Curves","248496619_Zur_Divisorenklassengruppenberechnung_in_globalen_Funktionenkorpern","248247711_Use_of_elliptic_curves_in_cryptology","239061442_Fast_Genus_Two_Hyperelliptic_Curve_Cryptosystems","227184388_Hyperelliptic_Curve_Cryptosystems_Closing_the_Performance_Gap_to_Elliptic_Curves","222877053_Computing_Riemann-Roch_Spaces_in_Algebraic_Function_Fields_and_Related_Topics","221451665_Computing_in_the_jacobian_of_a_plane_algebraic_curve","221355521_Faster_Point_Multiplication_on_Elliptic_Curves_with_Efficient_Endomorphisms","220695837_Algebraic_Function_Fields_and_Codes","220161494_Efficient_Algorithms_for_the_Riemann-Roch_Problem_and_for_Addition_in_the_Jacobian_of_a_Curve","44491243_Algebraic_geometry_arcata_1974_edited_by_Robin_Hartshorne","29604491_The_arithmetic_of_Jacobian_groups_of_superelliptic_cubics","3510313_Efficient_algorithms_for_the_Riemann-Roch_problem_and_for_additionin_the_Jacobian_of_a_curve","3084210_A_Publi-Key_Cryptosystem_and_Signature_Scheme_Based_on_Discrete_Logarithms_IEEE_Transactions_on_Information_Theory_314_469-472","3082825_New_Directions_in_Cryptography","2533588_Efficient_Arithmetic_on_Genus_2_Hyperelliptic_Curves_over_Finite_Fields_via_Explicit_Formulae","2480717_Hyperelliptic_Curve_Cryptosystems_Closing_the_Performance_Gap_to_Elliptic_Curves"]}
