{"id":"284070096_Identification_of_SLR_Tool_Needs_-_Results_of_a_Community_Workshop","abstract":"Context: With the increasing popularity of the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) process, there is also an increasing need for tool support. Objective: The goal of this work was to consult the software engineering researchers who conduct SLRs to identify and prioritize the necessary SLR tool features. Method: To gather information required to address this goal, we invited SLR authors to participate in an interactive 2 h workshop structured around the Nominal Group Technique. Results: The workshop outcomes indicated that Search & Selection and Collaboration are the two highest priority tool features. The results also showed that most of the high-priority features are not well-supported in current tools. Conclusion: These results support and extend the results of prior work. SLR tool authors can use these findings to guide future development efforts.","authors":["Ed Hassler","Jeff Carver","David Hale","Ahmed Al-Zubidy"],"meta":["October 2015Information and Software Technology 70(2)","DOI:10.1016/j.infsof.2015.10.011"],"references":["308646641_Towards_Evidence-Based_Ontology_for_Supporting_Systematic_Literature_Review","275967205_Tools_to_Support_Systematic_Reviews_in_Software_Engineering_A_Cross-Domain_Survey_using_Semi-structured_Interviews","274173947_A_Federated_Search_Approach_to_Facilitate_Systematic_Literature_Review_in_Software_Engineering","266202949_Tools_to_Support_Systematic_Reviews_in_Software_Engineering_A_Feature_Analysis","262241783_An_Approach_Based_on_Visual_Text_Mining_to_Support_Categorization_and_Classification_in_the_Systematic_Mapping","261245543_Tools_to_Support_Systematic_Literature_Reviews_in_Software_Engineering_A_Mapping_Study","260290630_A_Tertiary_Study_Experiences_of_Conducting_Systematic_Literature_Reviews_in_Software_Engineering","229189468_Linked_Data_approach_for_selection_process_automation_in_Systematic_Reviews","221494840_Using_Visual_Text_Mining_to_Support_the_Study_Selection_Activity_in_Systematic_Literature_Reviews","221252142_Analysing_the_Use_of_Graphs_to_Represent_the_Results_of_Systematic_Reviews_in_Software_Engineering","220738346_SLR-Tool_-_A_Tool_for_Performing_Systematic_Literature_Reviews","220277828_Studying_Software_Engineers_Data_Collection_Techniques_for_Software_Field_Studies","4279062_Automated_Information_Extraction_from_Empirical_Software_Engineering_Literature_Is_that_possible","4279058_Using_Context_Distance_Measurement_to_Analyze_Results_across_Studies","287023546_Slrtool_A_tool_to_support_collaborative_systematic_literature_reviews","266658763_Outcomes_of_a_community_workshop_to_identify_and_rank_barriers_to_the_systematic_literature_review_process","261303585_Automatic_Results_Identification_in_Software_Engineering_Papers_Is_it_Possible","261245538_Identifying_Barriers_to_the_Systematic_Literature_Review_Process","260724045_Towards_evidence-based_ontology_for_supporting_Systematic_Literature_Review","257391196_A_visual_analysis_approach_to_validate_the_selection_review_of_primary_studies_in_systematic_reviews","235271431_SLuRp_-_A_tool_to_help_large_complex_systematic_literature_reviews_deliver_calid_and_rigorous_results"]}
