{"id":"297826760_Mathematical_aspects_of_fullerenes","abstract":"Fullerene graphs are cubic, 3-connected, planar graphs with exactly 12 pentagonal faces, while all other faces are hexagons. Fullerene graphs are mathematical models of fullerene molecules, i.e., molecules comprised only by carbon atoms different than graphites and diamonds. We give a survey on fullerene graphs from our perspective, which could be also considered as an introduction to this topic. Different types of fullerene graphs are considered, their symmetries, and construction methods. We give an overview of some graph invariants that can possibly correlate with the fullerene molecule stability, such as: the bipartite edge frustration, the independence number, the saturation number, the number of perfect matchings, etc.","authors":["Vesna Andova","František Kardoš","Riste Škrekovski"],"meta":["March 2016Ars Mathematica Contemporanea 11(2)","DOI:10.26493/1855-3974.834.b02"],"references":["285354388_The_Szeged_index_-_A_success_story","282296103_Balaban_index_of_cubic_graphs","267668377_The_Smallest_Eigenvalue_of_Fullerene_Graphs_-_Closing_the_Gap","301875782_Fullerene_graphs_of_small_diameter","287864559_The_Wiener_and_Wiener_Polarity_Indices_of_a_Class_of_Fullerenes_with_Exactly_12n_Carbon_Atoms","286793184_CaGe_-_a_Virtual_Environment_for_Studying_Some_Special_Classes_of_Plane_Graphs_-_an_Update","283146740_Fast_generation_of_planar_graphs","270824665_Recursive_generation_of_IPR_fullerenes","267474709_Facts_and_Conjectures_about_Fullerene_Graphs_Leapfrog_Cylinder_and_Ramanujan_Fullerenes","266954718_On_the_12-spectral_spread_of_fullerenes"]}
