{"id":"309176375_Introductory_Programming_Subject_in_European_Higher_Education","abstract":"Programming is one of the basic subjects in most informatics, computer science mathematics and technical faculties' curricula. Integrated overview of the models for teaching programming , problems in teaching and suggested solutions were presented in this paper. Research covered current state of 1019 programming subjects in 715 study programmes at total of 218 faculties and 143 universities in 35 European countries that were analyzed. It was concluded that while most of the programmes highly support object-oriented paradigm of programming, introductory programming subjects are mainly based on imperative paradigm.","authors":["Veljko AleksiÄ‡","Mirjana Ivanovic"],"meta":["September 2016Informatics in Education 15(2):163-182","DOI:10.15388/infedu.2016.09"],"references":["309120076_Learning_and_teaching_styles_in_engineering_education_Engr","273054005_Ontology-Based_Architecture_with_Recommendation_Strategy_in_Java_Tutoring_System","257716774_Major_Problems_in_Basic_Programming_that_Influence_Student_Performance","319394383_How_to_Solve_it","308118027_Empirical_analysis_of_programming_language_adoption","271670341_Three_Levels_of_Goal_Orientation_in_Learning","266717660_C_how_to_program_2nd_ed","266308900_C_with_object-oriented_programming","260829004_First_Programming_Language_-_Never-ending_Story","257404330_Protus_20_Ontology-based_semantic_recommendation_in_programming_tutoring_system"]}
