{"id":"228875226_The_effects_of_distance_education_on_K-12_student_outcomes_A_meta-analysis","abstract":"Since the early 1930s, elementary and secondary students have learned through the use of electronic distance learning systems. Several benefits have been reported for K-12 distance education: increased access to education for students with a wide range of needs, flexibility in the speed and schedule of learning, greater parental influence on education. However, some researchers have found that the effectiveness of distance education depends on the contexts in which it occurs. The research on the effects of distance education on K-12 student outcomes has been somewhat ambiguous. This meta-analysis of 116 effect sizes from 14 web-delivered distance education programs studied between 1999 and 2004 shows that distance education can have the same effect on measures of student academic achievement when compared to traditional instruction. The study-weighted mean effect size across all outcomes was -0.028 with a 95% confidence interval from 0.060 to -0.116. No factors were found to be related to significant positive or negative effects. The factors that were tested included academic content area, grade level of the students, role of the distance learning program, role of the instructor, length of the program, type of school, frequency of the distance learning experience, pacing of instruction, timing of instruction, instructor preparation and experience in distance education, and the setting of the students.","authors":["Cathy Cavanaugh","Florida Kathy","Jo Gillan"],"meta":[],"references":["254654977_The_online_course_experience_evaluation_of_the_virtual_high_school's_third_year_of_implementation_1999-2000","252186073_ESTIMATES_OF_VARIANCE_COMPONENTS_IN_RANDOM_EFFECTS_META-ANALYSIS_SENSITIVITY_TO_VIOLATIONS_OF_NORMALITY_AND_VARIANCE_HOMOGENEITY","240273279_Teacher_Quality_and_Student_Achievement_A_Review_of_State_Policy_Evidence","237648143_How_Does_Distance_Education_Compare_With_Classroom_Instruction_A_Meta-Analysis_of_the_Empirical_Literature","233238873_Comparing_Student_Satisfaction_With_Distance_Education_to_Traditional_Classrooms_in_Higher_Education_A_Meta-Analysis","26468338_Differences_Between_Traditional_and_Distance_Education_Academic_Performances_A_Meta-Analytic_Approach","282274392_Internal_versus_external_control_of_reinforcement_A_case_history_of_a_variable","277785504_Comparison_of_the_Attitudes_of_Learners_Taking_Audiographic_Teleconferencing_Courses_in_Secondary_Schools_in_Northern_Ontario","277434382_The_Foundations_of_Distance_Education","254394342_The_Effectiveness_of_Interactive_Distance_Education_Technologies_in_K-12_Learning_A_Meta-Analysis","248940775_A_meta-analysis_of_the_effectiveness_of_telecourses_in_distance_education","240723599_The_Effects_of_School-Based_Writing-to-Learn_Interventions_on_Academic_Achievement_A_Meta-Analysis","238722646_The_Case_for_Constructivist_Classrooms","234726032_The_Effectiveness_of_Traditional_vs_Audiographics_Delivery_in_Senior_High_Advanced_Mathematics_Courses","220374641_The_Wisconsin_School_of_the_Air_success_story_with_implications","37699793_Learning_at_the_Back_door_Reflections_on_Non-traditional_Learning_in_the_Lifespan","36726074_An_investigation_into_the_effects_of_online_teaching_and_learning_on_achievement_outcomes_at_the_secondary_level","34323754_Distance_learning_using_digital_fiber_optics_a_study_of_student_achievement_and_student_perception_of_delivery_system_quality","31645126_Educational_Psychology_theory_into_practice_R_E_Slavin","19542390_Medical_education_in_the_21st_century"]}
