In this structure teachers and students are not grouped in a class and the virtual \"replace\" the real. To be operational this new teaching method requires interaction between different actors and proposes chat rooms, e-mail and discussion forum as alternatives to classical classroom interactions. But what happens in the reality? How can we sure these tools are efficient to ensure a good learning? The empirical research in this paper gathered 52 students to set up a working group drawn from a discussion forum. We followed their exchanges to show that interactions between learners are responsible for sharing, collaboration and co-construction of knowledge.","authors":["Yassine Jelmam"],"meta":["March 2010Questions Vives Recherches en Ã‰ducation","DOI:10.4000/questionsvives.545"],"references":["321551239_Advanced_Educational_Technology_Research_Issues_and_Future_Potential","289827874_Collaborative_Distance_Learning_and_Computer_Conferencing","285892998_Co-operative_learning_among_students","272792110_Analyse_Des_Donnees_Qualitatives","262244476_Analysing_asynchronous_learning_interactions_computer-mediated_communication_in_a_conventional_undergraduate_setting","250284255_L'economie_des_echanges_linguistiques","239563883_Analyse_semio-pragmatique_des_forums_pedagogiques_sur_Internet","232461220_Communication_Patterns_in_Task-Oriented_Groups","228847468_L'apprentissage_collaboratif_en_ligne_huit_avantages_qui_en_font_un_must","220041424_Mind_in_Society_The_Development_of_Higher_Psychological_Functions","44828853_Apprentissage_collaboratif_a_distance_Pour_comprendre_et_concevoir_les_environnements_d'apprentissage_virtuels","44820882_L'Apprentissage_cooperant","37759873_Quasi-oralite_de_l'ecriture_electronique_et_sentiment_de_communaute_dans_les_debats_scientifiques_en_ligne"]}
