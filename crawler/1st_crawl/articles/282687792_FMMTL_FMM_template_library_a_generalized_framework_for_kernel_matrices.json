{"id":"282687792_FMMTL_FMM_template_library_a_generalized_framework_for_kernel_matrices","abstract":"In response to two decades of development in structured dense matrix algorithms and a vast number of research codes, we present designs and progress towards a codebase that is abstracted over the primary domains of research. In the domain of mathematics, this includes the development of interaction kernels and their low-rank expansions. In the domain of high performance computing, this includes the optimized construction, traversal, and scheduling algorithms for the appropriate operations.We present a versatile system that can encompass the design decisions made over a decade of research while providing an abstracted, intuitive, and usable front-end that can integrated into existing linear algebra libraries.","authors":["Cris Cecka","Simon Layton"],"meta":["October 2015Lecture Notes in Computational Science and Engineering 103:611-620","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-10705-9_60"],"references":["254058727_Hierarchical_N-body_Simulations_with_Autotuning_for_Heterogeneous_Systems","235110866_Fourier_Based_Fast_Multipole_Method_for_the_Helmholtz_Equation","230859206_An_FMM_Based_on_Dual_Tree_Traversal_for_Many-core_Architectures","225090849_Pipelining_the_Fast_Multipole_Method_over_a_Runtime_System","23980963_Fast_multipole_methods_for_particle_dynamics","245538090_Comparison_of_treecodes_for_computing_electrostatic_potentials_in_charged_particle_systems_with_disjoint_targets_and_sources","227720226_Optimizing_the_multipole-to-local_operator_in_the_fast_multipole_method_for_graphical_processing_units","222833508_A_kernel-independent_adaptive_fast_multipole_method_in_two_and_three_dimensions","222821244_A_kernel_independent_fast_multipole_algorithm_for_radial_basis_functions","222474923_A_Fast_Adaptive_Multipole_Algorithm_in_Three_Dimensions","221668706_Data-Driven_Execution_of_Fast_Multipole_Methods","220206775_The_black-box_fast_multipole_method","51910745_A_sparse_octree_gravitational_N-body_code_that_runs_entirely_on_the_GPUprocessor","2757575_Skeletons_from_the_Treecode_Closet"]}
