{"id":"278048085_Simultaneously_Moving_Cops_and_Robbers","abstract":"In this paper we study the concurrent cops and robber (CCCR) game. CCCR\nfollows the same rules as the classical, turn-based game, except for the fact\nthat the players move simultaneously. The cops' goal is to capture the robber\nand the concurrent cop number of a graph is defined the minimum number of cops\nwhich guarantees capture. For the variant in which it it required to capture\nthe robber in the shortest possible time, we let time to capture be the payoff\nfunction of CCCR; the (game theoretic) value of CCCR is the optimal capture\ntime and (cop and robber) time optimal strategies are the ones which achieve\nthe value. In this paper we prove the following.\n(1) For every graph G, the concurrent cop number is equal to the \"classical\"\ncop number.\n(2) For every graph G, CCCR has a value, the cops have an optimal strategy\nand, for every epsilon>0, the robber has an epsilon-optimal strategy.","authors":["Georgios Konstantinidis","Athanasios Kehagias"],"meta":["June 2015Theoretical Computer Science 645","DOI:10.1016/j.tcs.2016.06.039","SourcearXiv"],"references":["263736624_Cops_and_Robbers_Game_Theory_and_Zermelo's_Early_Results","260367205_The_Role_of_Visibility_in_Pursuit_Evasion_Games","313250528_Infinite_games","312982657_Stochastic_games","271512781_Probability_and_Measure","266066629_Competitive_Markov_Decision_Processes","244461422_Existence_of_Value_and_Randomized_Strategies_in_Zero-Sum_Discrete-Time_Stochastic_Dynamic_Games","230873010_Differential_games_a_mathematical_theory_with_applications_to_warfare_and_pursuit_control_and_optimization","228108173_Game_Theory_with_Economic_Applications","223146727_Vertex-to-vertex_Pursuit_in_a_Graph"]}
