{"id":"222537098_Comparing_dropouts_and_persistence_in_e-Learning_courses","abstract":"Several studies have been conducted related to dropouts from on-campus and distance education courses. However, no clear definition of dropout from academic courses was provided. Consequently, this study proposes a clear and precise definition of dropout from academic courses in the context of e-learning courses. Additionally, it is documented in literature that students attending e-learning courses dropout at substantially higher rates than their counterparts in on-campus courses. Little attention has been given to the key factors associated with such substantial difference. This study explores two main constructs: (1) academic locus of control; and, (2) students’ satisfaction with e-learning. Results show that students’ satisfaction with e-learning is a key indicator in students’ decision to dropout from e-learning courses. Moreover, dropout students (non-completers) reported to have significantly lower satisfaction with e-learning than students who successfully completed (completers or persistent students) the same e-learning courses. Additionally, results of this study show that the academic locus of control appears to have no impact on students’ decision to drop from e-learning courses.","authors":["Yair Levy"],"meta":["February 2007Computers & Education 48(2):185-204","DOI:10.1016/j.compedu.2004.12.004","SourceDBLP"],"references":["291982813_An_academic_locus_of_control_scale_for_college_students","258212380_A_Revision_of_the_Academic_Locus_of_Control_Scale_for_College_Students","236026224_Drop-Outs_From_Higher_Education_A_Theoretical_Synthesis_of_Recent_Research","228953009_An_Examination_of_Social_Presence_in_Online_Courses_in_Relation_to_Students'_Perceived_Learning_and_Satisfaction","228831416_A_follow-up_investigation_of_teaching_presence_in_the_SUNY_Learning_Network","227138200_Student_Motivation_to_Learn_via_Computer_Conferencing","48306261_Course_Design_Factors_Influencing_the_Success_of_Online_Learning","48306260_Student_Satisfaction_and_Perceived_Learning_with_Online_Courses_-_Principles_and_Examples_from_the_SUNY_Learning_Network","48190148_A_study_of_learners'_perceived_value_and_satisfaction_for_implied_effectiveness_of_online_learning_systems","3942641_Toward_a_Value_Framework_for_Online_Learning_Systems","312371575_Locus_of_control","309107242_A_study_of_variables_that_predict_dropout_from_distance_education","305166663_Dropout_from_Higher_Education_A_Theoretical_Synthesis_of_Recent_Research","295174400_Pace_University's_focus_on_student_satisfaction_with_student_services_in_online_education","291982970_Identifying_predictors_of_academic_persistence_in_distance_education","291982937_Locus_of_control_and_incidental_learning_An_application_to_college_student_success","291982875_Toward_an_Abbreviated_Internal-External_Locus_of_Control_Scale","286567998_Generalization_expectations_for_internal_versus_external_control_of_reinforcement","275714419_Locus_of_control","271685249_A_Longitudinal-Process_Model_of_Drop-Out_from_Distance_Education","269496811_Academic_Locus_of_Control_of_University_Students_A_Caribbean_Case_Study","258051647_Student_satisfaction_and_perceived_learning_with_on-line_courses_Principles_and_examples_from_the_SUNY_learning_network","249698772_Completion_and_Attrition_in_Adult_Basic_Education_A_Test_of_Two_Pragmatic_Prediction_Models","249033820_Do_medial_influence_learning_Revising_the_debage_in_the_context_of_distance_education","249016759_An_illustration_with_case_studies_of_a_linear-process_model_of_drop-out_from_distance_education","246506183_Internal_versus_external_control_of_reinforcement","246296287_Generalized_Expectancies_for_Internal_Verses_External_Control_of_Reinforcement","244504146_Teaching_Effectiveness_in_Technology-Mediated_Distance_Learning","242557998_Validating_Instruments_in_MIS_Research","238396889_Identifying_Predictors_of_High_Risk_Among_Community_College_Telecourse_Students","234765071_The_Discourse_of_Dropout_in_Distance_Education_A_Theoretical_Analysis","234673580_Factors_Impacting_on_the_Success_of_Distance_Education_Students_of_the_University_of_the_West_Indies_A_Review_of_the_Literature","234667123_Predicting_Persistence_in_Distance_Learning_Programs","234602821_Student_Attrition_in_2-_and_4-Year_Colleges_Application_of_a_Theoretical_Model","234579242_A_Case_Study_Increase_Enrollment_by_Reducing_Dropout_Rates_in_Adult_Distance_Education","234564468_The_Lie_of_Online_Learning","233326360_Print_A_conceptual_model_of_correspondence_course_completion","232909883_Perceptions_and_Actions_of_Distance_Educators_on_Academic_Procrastination","232569456_Internal_Versus_External_Control_of_Reinforcement_A_Case_History_of_a_Variable","228974372_Pace_University's_focus_on_student_satisfaction_with_student_services_in_online_education","228847855_Mainstreaming_distance_learning_into_the_community_college","227446205_User_Satisfaction_with_Computer-Mediated_Communication_Systems","227062714_Characteristics_of_extenders_Full-time_students_who_take_light_credit_loads_and_graduate_in_more_than_four_years","222576796_A_survey_on_student_dropout_rates_and_dropout_causes_concerning_the_students_in_the_Course_of_Informatics_of_the_Hellenic_Open_University","222297430_Prediction_and_assessment_of_student_behaviour_in_open_and_distance_education_in_computers_using_Bayesian_networks","220260407_Using_IT_to_Reengineer_Business_Education_An_Exploratory_Investigation_of_Collaborative_Telelearning","220260138_Web-Based_Virtual_Learning_Environments_A_Research_Framework_and_a_Preliminary_Assessment_of_Effectiveness_in_Basic_IT_Skills_Training","44816755_Survey_Research_Methods","17828017_General_Expectancies_for_Internal_Versus_External_Control_of_Reinforcement"]}
