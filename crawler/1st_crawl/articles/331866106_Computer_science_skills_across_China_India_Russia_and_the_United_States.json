{"id":"331866106_Computer_science_skills_across_China_India_Russia_and_the_United_States","abstract":"We assess and compare computer science skills among final-year computer science undergraduates (seniors) in four major economic and political powers that produce approximately half of the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics graduates in the world. We find that seniors in the United States substantially outperform seniors in China, India, and Russia by 0.76–0.88 SDs and score comparably with seniors in elite institutions in these countries. Seniors in elite institutions in the United States further outperform seniors in elite institutions in China, India, and Russia by ∼0.85 SDs. The skills advantage of the United States is not because it has a large proportion of high-scoring international students. Finally, males score consistently but only moderately higher (0.16–0.41 SDs) than females within all four countries.","authors":["Prashant Loyalka","Ou Lydia Liu","Guirong Li","Igor Chirikov"],"meta":["March 2019Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 116(14):201814646","DOI:10.1073/pnas.1814646116"],"references":["276157250_Recruitment_of_Foreigners_in_the_Market_for_Computer_Scientists_in_the_United_States","273481248_The_international_state_of_research_on_measurement_of_competency_in_higher_education","259548706_University_Rankings_and_Social_Science","258162673_University_expansion_in_a_changing_global_economy_Triumph_of_the_BRICs_Stanford_University_Press","319593047_The_Gender_Wage_Gap_Extent_Trends_and_Explanations","318049006_Explaining_the_Gender_Wage_Gap_in_STEM_Does_Field_Sex_Composition_Matter","309568455_Global_Talent_Flows","290949997_Women_from_Diverse_Backgrounds_in_the_Science_Technology_Engineering_and_Math_STEM_Professions_Retention_and_Career_Development","275483336_Undergraduate_IT_education_in_China","264986162_Gender_Pay_Gap_and_Employment_Sector_Sources_of_Earnings_Disparities_in_the_United_States_1970-2010"]}
