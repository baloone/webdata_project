{"id":"265462109_On_the_Relation_Between_the_Logical_Structure_of_Systems_and_Their_Ability_to_Generate_Multiple_Steady_States_or_Sustained_Oscillations","abstract":"Simple feedback loops behave in two essentially different ways depending on whether they contain an odd number of inhibitory elements (“negative” loops) or an even number of inhibitory elements (“positive” loops); for proper values of parameters or delays, the former generate sustained oscillations, the latter, multiple steady states. For more complex systems, as far as one can tell, the presence of at least one negative loop in the logical structure appears as a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for a permanent periodic behaviour, and the presence of at least one positive loop as a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for multiple steady states.\n\nThe second part of this paper deals with the cooperative use of Boolean and continuous methods in the field and with the relations between Boolean and quantitative iteration methods.","authors":["R.
