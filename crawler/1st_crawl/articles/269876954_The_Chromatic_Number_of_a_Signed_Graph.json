{"id":"269876954_The_Chromatic_Number_of_a_Signed_Graph","abstract":"In 1982, Zaslavsky introduced the concept of a proper vertex colouring of a\nsigned graph $G$ as a mapping $\\phi\\colon V(G)\\to \\mathbb{Z}$ such that for any\ntwo adjacent vertices $u$ and $v$ the colour $\\phi(u)$ is different from the\ncolour $\\sigma(uv)\\phi(v)$, where is $\\sigma(uv)$ is the sign of the edge $uv$.\nThe substantial part of Zaslavsky's research concentrated on polynomial\ninvariants related to signed graph colourings rather than on the behaviour of\ncolourings of individual signed graphs. We continue the study of signed graph\ncolourings by proposing the definition of a chromatic number for signed graphs\nwhich provides a natural extension of the chromatic number of an unsigned\ngraph. We establish the basic properties of this invariant, provide bounds in\nterms of the chromatic number of the underlying unsigned graph, investigate the\nchromatic number of signed planar graphs, and prove an extension of the\ncelebrated Brooks theorem to signed graphs.","authors":["Edita Mácajová","André Raspaud","Martin Škoviera"],"meta":["December 2014The Electronic Journal of Combinatorics 23(1)","DOI:10.37236/4938","SourcearXiv"],"references":["265355357_On_the_partition_of_a_planar_graph_of_girth_5_into_an_empty_and_an_acyclic_subgraph","285899345_On_the_notion_of_balance_of_signed_graph","285344777_Decomposing_planar_graphs_of_girth_5_into_an_edgeless_and_acyclic_subgraphs","256157728_Acyclic_colorings_of_planar_graphs","248085472_Three_short_proofs_in_graphs","242793474_Signed_graphs_To_T_Zaslausky_Discrete_Appl_Math_4_1982_47-74","232346487_Signed_graphs","228110121_Graph_Classes_a_Survey","226258132_On_Colouring_the_Nodes_of_a_Network","223556043_Chromatic_invariants_of_signed_graphs"]}
