{"id":"338115458_Visualizing_Co-citations_of_Technology_Acceptance_Models_in_Education","abstract":"With the rapid development of information and communication technologies, studies devoted to technology-assisted education have been soaring up. Nevertheless, the studies on technology acceptance model (TAM) appear relatively fewer. This study, through reviewing high quality papers, analyzed the co-citations of TAM on the basis of the basic TAM and numerous extended TAMs. Co-citations of TAM were revealed and discussed in terms of citation counts, bursts, betweenness centrality, and sigma. It also reviews the basic concept underlying user acceptance models, as well as\nits extended TAMs in details. Future research into the TAM may resort to statistical support, as well as critical analysis. The interdisciplinary research design is also needed between computer science, education, psychology, statistics and mathematics.","authors":["Zhonggen Yu"],"meta":["December 2019Journal of Information Technology Research 13(1)","DOI:10.4018/JITR.2020010106"],"references":["323378852_Evaluation_of_Online_Video_Usage_and_Learning_Satisfaction_An_Extension_of_the_Technology_Acceptance_Model","287360679_Developing_a_General_Extended_Technology_Acceptance_Model_for_E-Learning_GETAMEL_by_analysing_commonly_used_external_factors","326102718_Modeling_Students'_Perceptions_of_Simulation-Based_Learning_Using_the_Technology_Acceptance_Model","325661702_Technology_Acceptance_Model_in_M-learning_context_A_systematic_review","316203784_Examining_the_students'_behavioral_intention_to_use_e-learning_in_Azerbaijan_The_General_Extended_Technology_Acceptance_Model_for_E-learning_approach","314244832_Enabling_internet_banking_adoption_An_empirical_examination_with_an_augmented_technology_acceptance_model_TAM","310756161_The_adoption_of_teaching_assistant_robots_a_technology_acceptance_model_approach","309962492_Investigating_the_effect_of_learning_styles_in_a_blended_e-learning_system_An_extension_of_the_technology_acceptance_model_TAM","301295811_Examining_the_Factors_Affecting_PDA_Acceptance_among_Physicians_An_Extended_Technology_Acceptance_Model","292600620_The_use_of_co-citations_to_study_science"]}
