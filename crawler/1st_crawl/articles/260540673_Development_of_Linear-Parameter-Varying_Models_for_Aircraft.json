{"id":"260540673_Development_of_Linear-Parameter-Varying_Models_for_Aircraft","abstract":"This paper presents a comparative study of three Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) modeling approaches and their application to the longitudinal motion of a Boeing 747 series 100/200. The three approaches used to obtain the quasi-LPV models are Jacobian linearisation, state transformation, and function substitution. Development of linear parameter varying models are a key step in applying LPV control synthesis. The models are obtained for the Up-andAway flight envelope of the Boeing 747-100/200. Comparisons of the three models in terms of their advantages, drawbacks and modeling difficulty are presented. Open-loop time responses show the three quasi-LPV models matching the behavior of the nonlinear model when in the trim region. Differences between the models are more apparent as the response of the aircraft deviates from the nominal trim conditions.","authors":["Andr√©s Marcos","Gary J.
