{"id":"260587274_Automated_Assessment_in_a_Programming_Tools_Course","abstract":"Automated assessment systems can be useful for both students and instructors. Ranking and immediate feedback can have a strongly positive effect on student learning. This paper presents an experience using automatic assessment in a programming tools course. The proposal aims at extending the traditional use of an online judging system with a series of assignments related to programming tools. Some empirical results on how students use an automated assessment system in a CS2 course are presented. Research suggested that automated assessment systems promoted the students' interest and produced statistically significant differences in the scores between experimental and control groups.","authors":["José Luis Fernández-Alemán"],"meta":["November 2011IEEE Transactions on Education 54(4):576-581","DOI:10.1109/TE.2010.2098442","Sourcedx.doi.org"],"references":["234806860_A_Course_on_Algorithms_and_Data_Structures_Using_On-line_Judging_ABSTRACT","225980190_Entertaining_Education_-_Using_Games-Based_and_Service-Oriented_Learning_to_Improve_STEM_Education","224384404_Towards_the_Validation_of_Plagiarism_Detection_Tools_by_Means_of_Grammar_Evolution","221538134_A_New_paradigm_for_programming_competitions","221247397_Entertaining_Education_-_Using_Games-Based_and_Service-Oriented_Learning_to_Improve_STEM_Education","221033003_An_Experience_on_Ada_Programming_Using_On-Line_Judging","220420326_Teaching_the_Nintendo_generation_to_program","220094517_The_BOSS_Online_Submission_and_Assessment_System","216714974_Mooshak_A_Web-based_multi-site_programming_contest_system","38175115_Automatic_test-based_assessment_of_programming_A_review","28576386_A_technical_perspective_on_ASAP_-_Automated_System_for_Assessment_of_Programming","313446780_Enhancing_elementary_programming_courses_using_e-learning_with_a_competitive_attitude","311474212_Combating_anonymousness_in_populous_CS1_and_CS2_courses","311473853_Evaluating_students'_programs_using_automated_assessment_a_case_study","290853724_How_to_Report_Statistics_in_Medicine","265668053_The_Art_of_Software_Testing","247699381_Taxonomy_o_f_Educational_Objectives_Cognitive_Domain","247573628_Software_Testing_Techniques","246800359_Setting_the_Stage_for_the_Culturally_Adaptive_Agent","240249302_Software_Engineering_a_Practioner''s_approach","228328451_Taxonomy_of_educational_objectives_Handbook_I_Cognitive_domain","224440472_Effects_of_Competitive_E-Learning_Tools_on_Higher_Education_Students_A_Case_Study","221538748_Assessing_the_assessment_of_programming_ability","220808323_Combating_anonymousness_in_populous_CS1_and_CS2_courses","220807791_Evaluating_students'_programs_using_automated_assessment_a_case_study","220695148_Software_testing_techniques_2_ed","220094452_Automated_assessment_and_experiences_of_teaching_programming","3407389_Software_Engineering_A_Practitioner's_Approach_Book_Review"]}
