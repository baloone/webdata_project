{"id":"330554785_AI_and_Automatic_Music_Generation_for_Mindfulness","abstract":"This paper presents an architecture for the creation of emotionally congruent music using machine learning aided sound synthesis. Our system can generate a small corpus of music using Hidden Markov Models; we can label the pieces with emotional tags using data elicited from questionnaires. This produces a corpus of labelled music underpinned by perceptual evaluations. We then analyse participant’s galvanic skin response (GSR) while listening to our generated music pieces and the emotions they describe in a questionnaire conducted after listening. These analyses reveal that there is a direct correlation between the calmness/scariness of a musical piece, the users’ GSR reading and the emotions they describe feeling. From these, we will be able to estimate an emotional state using biofeedback as a control signal for a machine-learning algorithm, which generates new musical structures according to a perceptually informed musical feature similarity model. Our case study suggests various applications including in gaming, automated soundtrack generation, and mindfulness.","authors":["Duncan Williams","Victoria Hodge","Lina Gega","Damian Thomas Murphy"],"meta":["January 2019","Conference: Audio Engineering Society: International Conference on Immersive and Interactive Audio"],"references":["229062505_Discrete_Emotions_or_Dimensions_Th_e_Role_of_Valence_Focus_and_Arousal_Focus","228092550_A_Review_of_Music_and_Emotion_Studies_Approaches_Emotion_Models_and_Stimuli","209436363_The_electrodermal_system","325675678_The_electrodermal_system","279235778_Affective_Neuroscience_The_Foundations_Of_Human_and_Animal_Emotions","263964521_Music_and_emotion_theory_and_research","263963905_Handbook_of_Music_and_Emotion_Theory_Research_Applications","231382175_The_Influence_of_Musical_Structure_on_Emotional_Expression","230223176_The_Shark_in_the_Music","221828597_Emotional_sweating_across_the_body_Comparing_16_different_skin_conductance_measurement_locations"]}
