The objective of this paper is to explain and investigate the existing knowledge on the application of Catalan numbers, with an emphasis on dynamic key generation and their application in data hiding. Our copyright method was applied, which is based on decomposition of Catalan numbers and is applied in data hiding in other data, so the very existence of codes is hidden in the data carrier.","authors":["Muzafer H.
