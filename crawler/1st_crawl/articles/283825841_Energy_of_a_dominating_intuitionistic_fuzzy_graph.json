{"id":"283825841_Energy_of_a_dominating_intuitionistic_fuzzy_graph","abstract":"In this paper we have defined the dominating intuitionistic fuzzy graphG = (V,E, μ, γ, μ1, γ1). The energy of such graph is defined. The upper and lower bounds for the energy of dominating intuitionistic fuzzy graph are discussed in detail. These concepts are illustrated with example. © 2015, International Journal Of Pharmacy and Technology. All rights reserved.","authors":["B Praba","G.
