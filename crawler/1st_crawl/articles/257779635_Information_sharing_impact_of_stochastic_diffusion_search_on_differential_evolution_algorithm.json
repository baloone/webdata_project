{"id":"257779635_Information_sharing_impact_of_stochastic_diffusion_search_on_differential_evolution_algorithm","abstract":"This work details the research aimed at applying the powerful resource allocation mechanism deployed in stochastic diffusion search (SDS) to the differential evolution (DE), effectively merging a nature inspired swarm intelligence algorithm with a biologically inspired evolutionary algorithm. The results reported herein suggest that the hybrid algorithm, exploiting information sharing between the population elements, has the potential to improve the optimisation capability of classical DE algorithms. This claim is verified by running several experiments using state-of-the-art benchmarks. Additionally, the significance of the frequency within which SDS introduces communication and information exchange is also investigated.","authors":["Mohammad Majid Al-Rifaie","John Mark Bishop","Tim Blackwell"],"meta":["December 2012Memetic Computing 4(4)","DOI:10.1007/s12293-012-0094-y","Project: Swarm Intelligence"],"references":["313029178_Evolutionary_optimization_for_computationally_expensive_problems_using_Gaussian_processes","312816335_Swarm_Intelligence","310750241_Efficient_fitness_estimation_in_noisy_environments","304425270_Differential_Evolution_-_A_Simple_and_Efficient_Heuristic_for_global_Optimization_over_Continuous_Spaces","292237683_New_migration_scheme_for_parallel_differential_evolution","285237745_DE-a_simple_and_efficient_heuristic_for_global_optimization_over_continuous_space","285087954_Simultaneous_Statistical_Inference","283996103_Genetic_Algorithms_In_Search_Optimization_and_Machine_Learning","273453883_Particle_Swarm_Optimization","272161385_The_ants"]}
