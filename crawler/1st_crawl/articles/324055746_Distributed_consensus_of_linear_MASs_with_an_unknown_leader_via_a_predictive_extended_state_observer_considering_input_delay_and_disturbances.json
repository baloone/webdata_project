{"id":"324055746_Distributed_consensus_of_linear_MASs_with_an_unknown_leader_via_a_predictive_extended_state_observer_considering_input_delay_and_disturbances","abstract":"The problem of disturbance rejection/attenuation for constant-input delayed linear multi-agent systems (MASs) with the directed communication topology is tackled in this paper, where a classic model reduction technique is introduced to transform the delayed MAS into the delay-free one. First, when the leader has no control input, a novel adaptive predictive extended state observer (ESO) using only relative state information of neighboring agents is designed to achieve disturbance-rejected consensus tracking. The stabilization analysis is presented via the Lyapunov function and sufficient conditions are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Then the result is extended to the disturbance-attenuated case where the leader has bounded control input which is only known by a portion of followers. Finally, two numerical examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of proposed strategies. The main contribution focuses on the design of adaptive predictive ESO protocols with the fully distributed property.","authors":["Wei Jiang","Zhaoxia Peng","Ahmed Rahmani","Wei Hu"],"meta":["March 2018Neurocomputing 315","DOI:10.1016/j.neucom.2018.07.040"],"references":["323195407_Predictor-Based_Extended-State-Observer_Design_for_Consensus_of_MASs_With_Delays_and_Disturbances","293640455_H_consensus_control_of_multi-agent_systems_with_input_delay_and_directed_topology","320173932_Pinning_Synchronization_of_Complex_Dynamical_Networks_With_Multiweights","319983244_Asynchronous_consensus_of_second-order_multi-agent_systems_with_impulsive_control_and_measurement_time-delays","319637593_Event-Triggered_Control_for_Consensus_of_Multiagent_Systems_With_FixedSwitching_Topologies","318126535_Discrete-Time_Predictor_Feedback_for_Consensus_of_Multi-Agent_Systems_with_Delays","313637341_Finite_spectrum_assignment_problem_for_systems_with_delays","312890364_Consensus_seeking_in_multi-agent_systems_under_dynamically_changing_interaction_topologies","312185425_Distributed_consensus_tracking_for_the_fractional-order_multi-agent_systems_based_on_the_sliding_mode_control_method","311846596_Distributed_Adaptive_Consensus_Disturbance_Rejection_for_Multi-Agent_Systems_on_Directed_Graphs"]}
