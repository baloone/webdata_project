{"id":"308878035_Desired_Skills_for_Entry_Level_IS_Positions_Identification_and_Assessment","abstract":"The present study sheds light on what employers believe to be important hard skills and soft skills for entry-level information systems (IS) positions. Results from a survey of N = 73 U.S.-based and international employers suggest that soft skills are significantly more important than hard skills for entry-level IS positions. The most important hard skills are Microsoft Office, database/data warehouse/SQL, and knowledge of security, while the most important soft skills are willingness to learn, critical thinking, and attitude. Employer characteristics (e.g., industry, size, location) do not affect the importance of hard skills and soft skills. Findings of this study are discussed in light of previous research. Results of this study can help to guide universities in IS curriculum development.","authors":["Kiku Jones","Lori N. K.
