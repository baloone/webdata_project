{"id":"333914977_A_quantum-inspired_classical_algorithm_for_recommendation_systems","abstract":"We give a classical analogue to Kerenidis and Prakash’s quantum recommendation system, previously believed to be one of the strongest candidates for provably exponential speedups in quantum machine learning. Our main result is an algorithm that, given an m × n matrix in a data structure supporting certain ℓ²-norm sampling operations, outputs an ℓ²-norm sample from a rank-k approximation of that matrix in time O(poly(k)log(mn)), only polynomially slower than the quantum algorithm. As a consequence, Kerenidis and Prakash’s algorithm does not in fact give an exponential speedup over classical algorithms. Further, under strong input assumptions, the classical recommendation system resulting from our algorithm produces recommendations exponentially faster than previous classical systems, which run in time linear in m and n.\nThe main insight of this work is the use of simple routines to manipulate ℓ²-norm sampling distributions, which play the role of quantum superpositions in the classical setting. This correspondence indicates a potentially fruitful framework for formally comparing quantum machine learning algorithms to classical machine learning algorithms.","authors":["Ewin Tang"],"meta":["June 2019","DOI:10.1145/3313276.3316310","Conference: the 51st Annual ACM SIGACT Symposium"],"references":["322243414_Quantum_Computing_in_the_NISQ_era_and_beyond","316184468_Quantum_gradient_descent_for_linear_systems_and_least_squares","301899005_Quantum_Recommendation_Systems","221497442_Learning_DNF_over_the_Uniform_Distribution_using_a_Quantum_Example_Oracle","221462656_Adaptive_Sampling_and_Fast_Low-Rank_Matrix_Approximation","220780614_Improved_recommendation_systems","220618187_Learning_DNF_over_the_Uniform_Distribution_Using_a_Quantum_Example_Oracle","220617443_Fast_Monte_Carlo_Algorithms_for_Matrices_I_Approximating_Matrix_Multiplication","3785038_Fast_Monte-Carlo_algorithms_for_finding_low-rank_approximations","2359879_Spectral_Analysis_of_Data","333915174_Quantum_singular_value_transformation_and_beyond_exponential_improvements_for_quantum_matrix_arithmetics","316746304_Randomized_algorithms_in_numerical_linear_algebra","310826772_Competitive_recommendation_systems","295699887_Matrix_factorization_techniques_for_recommender_systems","292798813_Beating_sgd_Learning_svms_in_sublinear_time","277614392_Read_the_fine_print","262368151_Relative-Error_CUR_Matrix_Decompositions","243964127_Quantum_algorithms_for_supervised_and_unsupervised_machine_learning","243964117_Quantum_principal_component_analysis","224574578_Matrix_factorization_techniques_for_recommender_systems_IEEE_Computer_Journal_428_30-37","222585709_Recommendation_Systems_A_Probabilistic_Analysis","222019048_Using_mixture_models_for_collaborative_filtering","221590396_Competitive_recommendation_systems","220617297_Strengths_and_Weakness_of_Quantum_Computing","220520181_Lessons_from_the_Netflix_prize_challenge","220430690_Fast_computation_of_low-rank_matrix_approximations","45876296_A_Simpler_Approach_to_Matrix_Completion","38082160_Quantum_Algorithm_for_Linear_Systems_of_Equations"]}
