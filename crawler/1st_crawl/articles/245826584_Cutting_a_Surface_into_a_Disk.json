{"id":"245826584_Cutting_a_Surface_into_a_Disk","abstract":"We consider the problem of cutting a set of edges on a poly- hedral manifold surface, possibly with boundary, to obtain a single topological disk, minimizing either the total num- ber of cut edges or their total length. We show that this problem is NP-hard, even for manifolds without boundary and for punctured spheres. We also describe an algorithm with running time n O(g+k) , where n is the combinatorial complexity, g is the genus, and k is the number of bound- ary components of the input surface. Finally, we describe a greedy algorithm that outputs a O(log 2 g)-approximation of the minimum cut graph in O(g 2 n log n) time.","authors":["Je Erickson","Sariel Har-Peled"],"meta":["January 2002"],"references":[]}
