{"id":"301950881_Using_Asynchronous_Hot_Standby_Spare_in_Time-Stamped_Fault-Tolerant_Real-Time_System","abstract":"Failure in a real-time system has different definition from failure in other general purpose systems so that in addition to functional failures may have some time-dependent failures. In a real-time system an output must be produced after threshold and before deadline. So missing the deadline is a kind of failure. In [3] by using artificial neural networks (ANN), a special TMR model is proposed to provide fault tolerance in real-time systems. Inclusion of time for decision mechanism in this model makes it useful for real-time systems. According to the mentioned model, system continues to operate until all nodes fail; but since missing the deadline is considered as a failure in a real-time system and there is probability of missing the deadline by all of three nodes simultaneously, we have a scenario in which system will fail just because of MISSING the Deadline. In this paper, a more comprehensive Method is proposed by which a real-time system is capable to tolerate such a scenario. This model is derived from the proposed model in [3] by adding an asynchronous hot standby spare for covering time-dependent faults in a real-time system.","authors":["Mahmoud Jsnnesari Ladani","Ahmad Kezemi Gazanchaei"],"meta":["January 2014","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-53751-6_32","In book: Proceedings of the 2013 International Conference on Electrical and Information Technologies for Rail Transportation (EITRT2013)-Volume II (pp.309-312)"],"references":["251818232_Time_Stamped_Fault_Tolerance_in_Real_Time_Systems","317729211_Fault_Tolerance_in_Real-Time_Systems"]}
