{"id":"349298538_Improving_the_Prediction_Accuracy_of_Academic_Performance_of_the_Freshman_Using_Wonderlic_Personnel_Test_and_Rey-Osterrieth_Complex_Figure","abstract":"Prediction of academic performance of the students continue to be hot topic in educational data mining field. In this paper, a linear regression analysis was conducted on IQ test, Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure (ROCF) and Cumulative Grade Points Average (CGPA). A dataset from 111 undergraduate (59 females, 52 males) students from 2 different faculties (Medicine and Computer Science) were collected. The results show that both IQ and ROCF are significantly correlated to CGPA. Linear regression test shows that the combination of IQ-ROCF (Î² = 0.565) can serve as good feature to predict CGPA.","authors":["Ochilbek Rakhmanov","Senol Dane"],"meta":["February 2021Communications in Computer and Information Science 1350:54-65","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-69143-1_5"],"references":["354162712_Prediction_of_Student's_performance_using_selected_classification_methods_A_Data_mining_Approach","343610206_Experimentation_on_Hand_Drawn_Sketches_by_Children_to_Classify_Draw-a-Person_Test_Images_in_Psychology","342391506_Correlations_Among_IQ_Visual_Memory_Assessed_by_ROCF_Test_and_GPA_in_University_Students","339750765_The_Relationships_among_Gender_Handedness_GPA_Depression_and_Visual_Memory_in_the_ROCF_Test_in_University_Students","338721775_Development_of_a_Method_for_Evaluating_Quality_of_Education_in_Secondary_Schools_Using_ML_Algorithms","316886613_Closing_institutional_gaps_through_academic_research_management_system_and_implications_in_Nigeria","308353845_Predicting_student_academic_performance_in_an_engineering_dynamics_course_A_comparison_of_four_types_of_predictive_mathematical_models","288028750_L'examen_psychologique_dans_le_cas_d'encephalopathie_traumatique","285077550_Le_test_de_copie_d'une_figure_complex_Contribution_a_l'etude_de_la_perception_et_de_la_memoire","277604702_A_multivariate_approach_to_predicting_student_outcomes_in_web-enabled_blended_learning_courses","276863880_A_Predictive_Model_to_Evaluate_Student_Performance","233777224_Analysis_of_cultural_and_gender_influences_on_teamwork_performance_for_software_requirements_analysis_in_multinational_environments","275714105_Wonderlic_Personnel_Test_Manual","257171482_Predicting_student_academic_performance_in_an_engineering_dynamics_course_A_comparison_of_four_types_of_predictive_mathematical_models","233463405_Rey_Complex_Figure_Test_under_four_different_administration_procedures"]}
