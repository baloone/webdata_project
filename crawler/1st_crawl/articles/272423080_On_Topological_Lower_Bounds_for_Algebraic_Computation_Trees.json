{"id":"272423080_On_Topological_Lower_Bounds_for_Algebraic_Computation_Trees","abstract":"We prove that the height of any algebraic computation tree for deciding\nmembership in a semialgebraic set is bounded from below (up to a multiplicative\nconstant) by the logarithm of m-th Betti number (with respect to singular\nhomology) of the set, divided by m+1. This result complements the well known\nlower bound by Yao for locally closed semialgebraic sets in terms of the total\nBorel-Moore Betti number. We also prove that the height is bounded from below\nby the logarithm of m-th Betti number of a projection of the set onto a\ncoordinate subspace, divided by (m+1)^2. We illustrate these general results by\nexamples of lower complexity bounds for some specific computational problems.","authors":["Nicolai Vorobjov","Andrei Gabrielov"],"meta":["February 2015Foundations of Computational Mathematics 17(1)","DOI:10.1007/s10208-015-9283-7","SourcearXiv"],"references":["265373640_Betti_Numbers_of_Semialgebraic_and_Sub-Pfaffian_Sets","248304958_Variations_by_complexity_theorists_on_three_themes_of_Euler_Bezout_Betti_and_Poincare","234781245_Lower_Bounds_for_Algebraic_Computation_Trees","220452494_Betti_Numbers_of_Semialgebraic_Sets_Defined_by_Quantifier-Free_Formulae","1770548_Approximation_of_definable_sets_by_compact_families_and_upper_bounds_on_homotopy_and_homology","225819517_The_Complexity_of_Computations_Under_Varying_Sets_of_Primitives","221591834_Lower_Bounds_for_Algebraic_Computation_Trees_Preliminary_Report","221590880_Decision_Tree_Complexity_and_Betti_Numbers","221220330_On_the_complexity_of_computations_under_varying_sets_of_primitives","220574012_Decision_Tree_Complexity_and_Betti_Numbers"]}
