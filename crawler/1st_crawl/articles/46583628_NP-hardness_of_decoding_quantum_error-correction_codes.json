{"id":"46583628_NP-hardness_of_decoding_quantum_error-correction_codes","abstract":"Though the theory of quantum error correction is intimately related to the\nclassical coding theory, in particular, one can construct quantum error\ncorrection codes (QECCs) from classical codes with the dual containing\nproperty, this does not necessarily imply that the computational complexity of\ndecoding QECCs is the same as their classical counterparts. Instead, decoding\nQECCs can be very much different from decoding classical codes due to the\ndegeneracy property. Intuitively, one expect degeneracy would simplify the\ndecoding since two different errors might not and need not be distinguished in\norder to correct them. However, we show that general quantum decoding problem\nis NP-hard regardless of the quantum codes being degenerate or non-degenerate.\nThis finding implies that no considerably fast decoding algorithm exists for\nthe general quantum decoding problems, and suggests the existence of a quantum\ncryptosystem based on the hardness of decoding QECCs.","authors":["Min-Hsiu Hsieh","Francois Le Gall"],"meta":["September 2010Physical review A, Atomic, molecular, and optical physics 83(5)","DOI:10.1103/PhysRevA.83.052331","SourcearXiv"],"references":["45934729_The_McEliece_Cryptosystem_Resists_Quantum_Fourier_Sampling_Attacks","12332437_Simple_Proof_of_Security_of_the_BB84_Quantum_Key_Distribution_Protocol","6787167_Correcting_Quantum_Errors_with_Entanglement","3079541_Quantum_error_correction_via_codes_over_GF4","3077573_Hardness_of_solving_subset_sum_with_preprocessing","3077543_Hardness_of_decoding_linear_codes_with_preprocessing","238656246_Fundamentals_of_Error-Correcting_Codes","222257702_The_Hardness_of_Approximate_Optima_in_Lattices_Codes_and_Systems_of_Linear_Equations","13375764_Shor_P_W_Scheme_for_reducing_decoherence_in_quantum_computer_memory_Phys_Rev_A_52_R2493-R2496","3880902_Succinct_quantum_proofs_for_properties_of_finite_groups","3083048_On_the_inherent_intractability_of_certain_coding_problems_Corresp","2202154_Stabilizer_Codes_and_Quantum_Error_Correction","2201530_Quantum_Error-Correcting_Codes_Need_Not_Completely_Reveal_the_Error_Syndrome"]}
