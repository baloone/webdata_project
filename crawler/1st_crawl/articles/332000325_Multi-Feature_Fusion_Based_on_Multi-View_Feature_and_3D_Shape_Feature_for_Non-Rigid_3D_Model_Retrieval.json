{"id":"332000325_Multi-Feature_Fusion_Based_on_Multi-View_Feature_and_3D_Shape_Feature_for_Non-Rigid_3D_Model_Retrieval","abstract":"To make full use of the effective discriminative information of the non-rigid 3D model, we propose a novel multi-feature fusion method to fuse the multi-view feature and the 3D shape feature and apply it in non-rigid 3D model retrieval. First, we compute the canonical form of the non-rigid 3D model using the biharmonic distance based least squares multidimensional scaling (LS-MDS) algorithm and generate multiple projective depth images. The learning based multiple pooling fusion method is used in the multi-view convolutional neural network to reduce the information loss and extract more effective multi-view feature. Then, we compute the wave kernel signature of each vertex and construct the multi-energy shape distribution of the non-rigid 3D model. The convolutional neural network is used for learning the 3D shape feature. Finally, we use the kernel canonical correlation analysis (KCCA) algorithm to fuse the multi-view feature and the 3D shape feature for retrieval. Our experimental results have shown that compared with the geodesic distance based LS-MDS algorithm, the biharmonic distance based LS-MDS algorithm have higher computation efficiency and better performance. Compared with other state-of-the-art methods, our proposed method can better use of the two kinds of features and has achieved better retrieval results.","authors":["Hui Zeng","Qi Wang","Jiwei Liu"],"meta":["March 2019IEEE Access PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2907609"],"references":["328251426_Classifying_3D_objects_in_LiDAR_point_clouds_with_a_back-propagation_neural_network","312406181_GIFT_Towards_Scalable_3D_Shape_Retrieval","311610600_GIFT_A_Real-Time_and_Scalable_3D_Shape_Search_Engine","277650031_Non-rigid_3D_Shape_Retrieval","257406714_Combination_of_Bag-of-Words_Descriptors_for_Robust_Partial_Shape_Retrieval","257334107_CM-BOF_Visual_similarity-based_3D_shape_retrieval_using_Clock_Matching_and_Bag-of-Features","255482849_Deep_Canonical_Correlation_Analysis","236018240_Feature-Preserved_3D_Canonical_Form","221429878_The_wave_kernel_signature_A_quantum_mechanical_approach_to_shape_analysis","221326499_Visual_Similarity_Based_3D_Shape_Retrieval_Using_Bag-of-Features","220888702_3D_Object_Retrieval_using_an_Efficient_and_Compact_Hybrid_Shape_Descriptor","220888696_Retrieval_of_3D_Articulated_Objects_Using_a_Graph-based_Representation","220888659_SHREC_'11_Track_Shape_Retrieval_on_Non-rigid_3D_Watertight_Meshes","220464919_Retrieving_articulated_3-D_models_using_medial_surfaces","3193602_On_Bending_Invariant_Signatures_for_Surfaces","2479242_Fast_Marching_farthest_point_sampling","327084213_Biharmonic_Distance_and_Performance_of_Second-Order_Consensus_Networks_with_Stochastic_Disturbances","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","316501485_Deep_Multimetric_Learning_for_Shape-Based_3D_Model_Retrieval","312257421_Progressive_Shape-Distribution-Encoder_for_3D_Shape_Retrieval","309365540_Non-rigid_3D_Model_Retrieval_Based_on_Weighted_Bags-of-Phrases_and_LDA","307683965_Efficient_Measurement_of_Shape_Dissimilarity_between_3D_Models_Using_Z-Buffer_and_Surface_Roving_Method","305744686_DeepShape_Deep-Learned_Shape_Descriptor_for_3D_Shape_Retrieval","301829335_Learning_a_discriminative_deformation-invariant_3D_shape_descriptor_via_many-to-one_encoder","271772612_Learning_View-Model_Joint_Relevance_for_3D_Object_Retrieval","262111100_SHOT_Unique_Signatures_of_Histograms_for_Surface_and_Texture_Description","230745561_A_comparison_of_methods_for_non-rigid_3D_shape_retrieval","230221658_Modern_Multidimensional_Scaling_Theory_and_Applications","221364025_Scale-Invariant_Heat_Kernel_Signatures_for_Non-Rigid_Shape_Recognition","220506247_A_Concise_and_Provably_Informative_Multi-Scale_Signature_Based_on_Heat_Diffusion","220183457_Biharmonic_Distance","8204636_Canonical_Correlation_Analysis_An_Overview_with_Application_to_Learning_Methods","3192976_Using_Spin_Images_for_Efficient_Object_Recognition_in_Cluttered_3D_Scenes"]}
