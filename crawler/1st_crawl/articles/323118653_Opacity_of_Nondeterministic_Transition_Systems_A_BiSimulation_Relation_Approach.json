{"id":"323118653_Opacity_of_Nondeterministic_Transition_Systems_A_BiSimulation_Relation_Approach","abstract":"In this paper, we propose several opacity-preserving (bi)simulation relations for general nondeterministic transition systems (NTS) in terms of initial-state opacity, current-state opacity, K-step opacity, and infinite-step opacity. We also show how one can leverage quotient construction to compute such relations. In addition, we use a two-way observer method to verify opacity of nondeterministic finite transition systems (NFTSs). As a result, although the verification of opacity for infinite NTSs is generally undecidable, if one can find such an opacity-preserving relation from an infinite NTS to an NFTS, the (lack of) opacity of the NTS can be easily verified over the NFTS which is decidable.","authors":["Kuize Zhang","Xiang Yin","Majid Zamani"],"meta":["February 2018IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control PP(99)","DOI:10.1109/TAC.2019.2908726"],"references":["330890085_Opacity_Enforcement_Using_Nondeterministic_Publicly_Known_Edit_Functions","321030961_Probabilistic_system_opacity_in_discrete_event_systems","320952807_Current-state_opacity_enforcement_in_discrete_event_systems_under_incomparable_observations","315997081_Decidability_of_opacity_verification_problems_in_labeled_Petri_net_systems","294873311_Overview_of_Discrete_Event_Systems_Opacity_models_validation_and_quantification","282426709_A_Uniform_Approach_for_Synthesizing_Property-Enforcing_Supervisors_for_Partially-Observed_Discrete-Event_Systems","276250083_Maximum_Information_Release_While_Ensuring_Opacity_in_Discrete_Event_Systems","313091050_A_New_Approach_for_the_Verification_of_Infinite-Step_and_K-Step_Opacity_using_Two-Way_Observers","304456641_Probabilistic_system_opacity_in_discrete_event_systems","302879134_Hybrid_dynamical_systems_An_introduction_to_control_and_verification"]}
