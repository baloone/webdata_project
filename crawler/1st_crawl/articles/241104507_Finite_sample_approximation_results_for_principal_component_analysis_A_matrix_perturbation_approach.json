{"id":"241104507_Finite_sample_approximation_results_for_principal_component_analysis_A_matrix_perturbation_approach","abstract":"Principal component analysis (PCA) is a standard tool for dimensional reduction of a set of n observations (samples), each with p variables. In this paper, using a matrix perturbation approach, we study the nonasymptotic re- lation between the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of PCA computed on a finite sample of size n, and those of the limiting population PCA as n →∞ .A s in machine learning, we present a finite sample theorem which holds with high probability for the closeness between the leading eigenvalue and eigenvec- tor of sample PCA and population PCA under a spiked covariance model. In addition, we also consider the relation between finite sample PCA and the asymptotic results in the joint limit p, n →∞ , with p/n = c .W e present a matrix perturbation view of the \"phase transition phenomenon,\" and a simple linear-algebra based derivation of the eigenvalue and eigenvector overlap in this asymptotic limit. Moreover, our analysis also applies for finite p, n where we show that although there is no sharp phase transition as in the infinite case, either as a function of noise level or as a function of sample size n, the eigen- vector of sample PCA may exhibit a sharp \"loss of tracking,\" suddenly losing its relation to the (true) eigenvector of the population PCA matrix. This occurs due to a crossover between the eigenvalue due to the signal and the largest eigenvalue due to noise, whose eigenvector points in a random direction.","authors":["BOAZ NADLER"],"meta":["December 2008The Annals of Statistics 36(6)","DOI:10.1214/08-AOS618","SourcearXiv"],"references":["301859063_Eigenvalues_of_Large_Sample_Covariance_Matrices_of_Spiked_Population_Models","230681289_PCA_learning_for_sparse_high-dimensional_data","220656738_Refined_Perturbation_Bounds_for_Eigenvalues_of_Hermitian_and_Non-Hermitian_Matrices","215930489_Distribution_for_Some_Sets_of_Random_Matrices","38359490_On_Wielandt's_Inequality_and_Its_Application_to_the_Asymptotic_Distribution_of_the_Eigenvalues_of_a_Random_Symmetric_Matrix","38352004_Phase_transition_of_the_largest_eigenvalue_for_non-null_complex_covariance_matrices","23644863_Eigenvalues_of_large_sample_covariance_matrices_of_spiked_population_models","2599844_Improved_Linear_Discrimination_Using_Time-Frequency_Dictionaries","2419730_Statistical_Mechanics_of_Unsupervised_Structure_Recognition","313555517_Local_operator_theory_random_matrices_and_Banach_spaces","284537529_A_User's_Guide_to_Principal_Components","284438386_An_Introduction_to_Multivariate_Statistical_Analysis","279384963_Principal_Component_Analysis_and_Factor_Analysis","273249118_An_Introduction_to_Multivariate_Statistical_Analysis","272860727_Matrix_Analysis","269855989_The_Symmetric_Eigenvalue_Problem","267724226_The_principal_components_estimation_of_large_factor_models_when_factors_are_weak","259289317_A_User_Friendly_Guide_to_Multivariate_Calibration_and_Classification","246456885_Independent_Component_Analysis_A_Tutorial","243095442_The_Rotation_of_Eigenvectors_by_a_Perturbation_III","237067978_Independent_Component_Analysis","231148239_A_Gaussian_scenario_for_unsupervised_learning","230801964_Perturbation_Theory_of_Linear_Operators","228649256_Asymptotics_of_sample_eigenstruture_for_a_large_dimensional_spiked_covariance_model","227663608_Partial_least_squares_Beer's_law_and_the_net_analyte_signal_Statistical_modeling_and_analysis","227606949_The_prediction_error_in_CLS_and_PLS_The_importance_of_feature_selection_prior_to_multivariate_calibration","222684523_On_the_empirical_distribution_of_eigenvalues_of_large_dimensional_information-plus-noise-type_matrices","222546612_Determining_the_number_of_components_in_a_factor_model_from_limited_noisy_data","52012612_A_User's_Guide_To_Principal_Components","38368304_On_the_Sampling_Theory_of_Roots_of_Determinantal_Equations","38366194_Asymptotic_Theory_for_Principal_Component_Analysis","38348265_On_the_Distribution_of_the_Largest_Eigenvalue_in_Principal_Components_Analysis","30962658_Tests_of_Significance_for_the_Latent_Roots_of_Covariance_and_Correlation_Matrices","23951944_Sparse_Principal_Components_Analysis","23631005_Analysis_of_the_Limiting_Spectral_Distribution_of_Large_Dimensional_Random_Matrices","23630998_On_the_Empirical_Distribution_of_Eigenvalues_of_a_Class_of_Large_Dimensional_Random_Matrices","2772083_Computing_the_Eigenvalues_and_Eigenvectors_of_Arrowhead_Matrices","2715468_Optimal_Unsupervised_Learning","2391120_Stochastic_Perturbation_Theory","2290368_Perturbation_Theory_for_the_Singular_Value_Decomposition","2118239_Tracy-Widom_limit_for_the_largest_eigenvalue_of_a_large_class_of_complex_sample_covariance_matrices"]}
