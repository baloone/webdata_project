{"id":"220140191_Exploring_the_educational_potential_of_robotics_in_schools_A_systematic_review","abstract":"This study reviews recently published scientific literature on the use of robotics in schools, in order to: (a) identify the potential contribution of the incorporation of robotics as educational tool in schools, (b) present a synthesis of the available empirical evidence on the educational effectiveness of robotics as an educational tool in schools, and (c) define future research perspectives concerning educational robotics. After systematically searching online bibliographic databases, ten relevant articles were located and included in the study. For each article, we analyze the purpose of the study, the content to be taught with the aid of robotics, the type of robot used, the research method used, and the sample characteristics (sample size, age range of students and/or level of education) and the results observed. The articles reviewed suggest that educational robotics usually acts as an element that enhances learning, however, this is not always the case, as there are studies that have reported situations in which there was no improvement in learning. The outcomes of the literature review are discussed in terms of their implications for future research, and can provide useful guidance for educators, practitioners and researchers in the area.","authors":["Fabiane Barreto Vavassori Benitti"],"meta":["April 2012Computers & Education 58(3):978-988","DOI:10.1016/j.compedu.2011.10.006","SourceDBLP"],"references":["262310824_Using_Robotics_to_Motivate_'Back_Door'_Learning","234725693_Acquisition_of_Physics_Content_Knowledge_and_Scientific_Inquiry_Skills_in_a_Robotics_Summer_Camp","228756057_Procedures_for_Performing_Systematic_Reviews","227521911_Robotics_and_science_literacy_Thinking_skills_science_process_skills_and_systems_understanding","227036199_New_Pathways_into_Robotics_Strategies_for_Broadening_Participation","226696409_Children_robotics_and_education","225162096_Robotics_projects_and_learning_concepts_in_science_technology_and_problem_solving","224298889_The_Dof-Box_Project_An_Educational_Kit_for_Configurable_Robots","224088900_The_use_of_digital_manipulatives_in_K-12_Robotics_GPSGIS_and_programming","200744655_An_autonomous_educational_mobile_robot_mediator","5289502_LEGOR_Therapy_and_the_Social_Use_of_Language_Programme_An_Evaluation_of_Two_Social_Skills_Interventions_for_Children_with_High_Functioning_Autism_and_Asperger_Syndrome","4045920_Designing_a_low-cost_expressive_educational_robot","281345819_The_Research_Methods_Knowledge_Base","277762597_The_Effect_of_4-H_Robotics_and_Geospatial_Technologies_on_Science_Technology_Engineering_and_Mathematics_Learning_and_Attitudes","275175786_Optimal_experimental_design_with_R","271672066_Robotics_as_Means_to_Increase_Achievement_Scores_in_an_Informal_Learning_Environment","262234222_The_use_of_digital_manipulatives_in_K-12","238319885_Sizing_and_seizing_the_robotics_opportunity","237442656_Using_Robotics_to_Enhance_Science_Technology_Engineering_and_Mathematics_Curricula","234707215_Teaching_Evolution_to_Non-English_Proficient_Students_by_Using_Lego_Robotics","228328529_Mindstorms_Children_Computers_and_Powerful_Ideas","224088549_RoboEduc_A_Pedagogical_Tool_to_support_Educational_Robotics","223753783_Does_lego_training_stimulate_pupils'_ability_to_solve_logical_problems","223265798_Exploring_the_Potential_of_Computer_and_Video_Games_for_Health_and_Physical_Education_A_Literature_Review","220374731_The_Effect_of_LEGO_Training_on_Pupils'_School_Performance_in_Mathematics_Problem_Solving_Ability_and_Attitude_Swedish_Data","201381960_Evaluating_Training_Programs_The_Four_Levels","4291518_Using_a_Mobile_Robot_as_an_Educational_Tool"]}
