{"id":"317060991_Cloud_manufacturing_system_for_sheet_metal_processing","abstract":"Cloud computing is changing the way industries and enterprises run their businesses. Cloud manufacturing is emerging as an approach to transform the traditional manufacturing business model, while helping the manufacturer to align production efficiency with its business strategy, and creating intelligent factory networks that enable collaboration across the whole enterprise. Many production planning and control (PPC) problems are essentially optimisation problems, where the objective is to develop a plan that meets the demand at minimum cost or maximum profit. Because the underlying optimisation problem will vary in the different business and operation phases, it is important to think about optimisation in a dynamic mechanism and in a number of interlinked sub-problems at the same time. Cloud manufacturing has the potential to offer decision support as a service and medium of communication in PPC. To solve these problems and produce collaboration across the supply chain, this paper provides an overview of the state of the art in cloud manufacturing and presents a model of cloud-based production planning and production system for sheet metal processing.","authors":["Petri Helo","Yuqiuge Hao"],"meta":["June 2017Production Planning and Control 28(6-8):524-537","DOI:10.1080/09537287.2017.1309714"],"references":["271669733_A_state-of-the-art_survey_of_cloud_manufacturing","270219362_Factory_Planning_System_Considering_Energy-efficient_Process_under_Cloud_Manufacturing","266880452_Cloud_manufacturing_A_computing_and_service-oriented_manufacturing_model","262056560_Internet_of_Things_for_Enterprise_Systems_of_Modern_Manufacturing","261632568_Times_and_costs_analysis_for_sheet-metal_cutting_processes_in_an_integrated_CADCAM_system","257336817_Online_optimization_of_multipass_machining_based_on_cloud_computing","255569831_Rationalizing_Tool_Selection_in_a_Flexible_Manufacturing_System_for_Sheet-Metal_Products","254083862_Optimal_process_planning_for_a_combined_punch-and-laser_cutting_machine_using_ant_colony_optimization","241709205_Cloud_manufacturing_A_new_manufacturing_paradigm","228760729_The_AARIA_agent_architecture_From_manufacturing_requirements_to_agent-based_system_design","227420918_The_Impact_of_Trust_and_Contract_on_Innovation_Performance_The_Moderating_Role_of_Environmental_Uncertainty","225820890_Sheet_metal_cutting_and_piercing_operations_planning_and_tools_configuration_by_an_expert_system","3076493_Coordination_mechanisms_for_multi-agent_manufacturing_systems_applications_to_integrated_manufacturing_scheduling","309056779_Manufacturing_and_the_Cloud","289221689_A_cloud_computing_methodology_for_industrial_automation_and_manufacturing_execution_system","272127110_Research_on_Cloud_Manufacturing_Resource_Scheduling_and_Performance_Analysis","271589473_The_NIST_definition_of_cloud_computing","271550391_Research_on_virtualization_of_manufacturing_resources","268065463_Configurable_intelligent_optimization_algorithm_Design_and_practice_in_manufacturing","266643143_Application_of_Cloud_Manufacturing_based_on_the_principle_of_Process-Aware_Information_System","261334631_System-of-system_approaches_and_challenges_for_multi-site_manufacturing","261263098_The_architecture_of_cloud_maufacturing_and_its_key_technologies_research","261243808_Massive_sensor_data_management_framework_in_Cloud_manufacturing_based_on_Hadoop","258207482_A_platform_for_optimization_in_distributed_manufacturing_enterprises_based_on_cloud_manufacturing_paradigm","257336916_Cloud_manufacturing_service_platform_for_small-_and_medium-sized_enterprises","257242528_Automated_design_of_sheet_metal_punches_for_bending_multiple_parts_in_a_single_setup","257153346_Reducing_the_number_of_setups_for_CNC_punch_presses","252936093_Research_of_Cloud_Manufacturing_and_Resource_Encapsulation_Technology","248787393_Multi-agent_systems_in_production_planning_and_control_An_overview","248252363_Characterization_of_an_iron-based_laser_sintered_material","245310238_Survey_of_resource_allocation_methods_for_distributed_manufacturing_systems","243698174_Dynamic_scheduling_in_cellular_manufacturing_systems_A_framework_for_networked_decision_making","233785672_Coordination_and_control_in_distributed_and_agent-based_manufacturing_systems","229131933_From_cloud_computing_to_cloud_manufacturing","226437911_An_integrated_manufacturing_information_system_for_mass_sheet_metal_cutting","223473579_Optimization_of_sheet_metal_forming_processes_by_adaptive_response_surface_based_on_intelligent_sampling_method","223385222_Multi-objective_optimization_of_sheet_metal_forming_process_using_Pareto-based_genetic_algorithm","223040551_Optimization_of_sheet_metal_forming_processes_by_the_use_of_numerical_simulations","222692165_Scheduling_with_tool_changes_to_minimize_total_completion_time_under_controllable_machining_conditions","222572287_Considering_manufacturing_cost_and_scheduling_performance_on_a_CNC_turning_machine","222567907_Agent-Based_Systems_for_Manufacturing","221223034_Research_on_cloud_storage_architecture_and_key_technologies","220621417_Architectural_Requirements_for_Cloud_Computing_Systems_An_Enterprise_Cloud_Approach","220572043_ManuCloud_The_Next-Generation_Manufacturing_as_a_Service_Environment","220384432_A_multi-agent_based_agile_manufacturing_planning_and_control_system","220381864_Managing_the_design-manufacturing_interface_in_virtual_enterprises_through_multi_user_virtual_environments_A_perspective_approach","220381748_Optimal_layout_and_path_planning_for_flame_cutting_of_sheet_metals","220330711_The_Contract_Net_Protocol_High-Level_Communication_and_Control_in_a_Distributed_Problem_Solver","31597746_Job_Scheduling_and_Management_of_Wearing_Tools_with_Stochastic_Tool_Lifetimes"]}
