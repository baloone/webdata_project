{"id":"345126943_Energy-efficient_forwarding_strategies_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_in_fading_channels","abstract":"In the context of geographic routing in wireless sensor networks linked by fading communication channels, energy-efficient transmission is important to extend the network lifetime. To this end, we propose a novel method to minimize the energy consumed by one bit of information per meter and per second toward the destination in fading channels. Using the outage probability as a measure to maximize the amount of information delivered within a given time interval we decide energy-efficient geographic routing between admissible nodes in a wireless sensor network. We present three different approaches, the first is optimal and is obtained by varying both transmission rate and power, the other two are sub-optimal since only one of them is tuned. Simulation examples comparing the energy costs for the different strategies illustrate the theoretical analysis in the cases of log-normal and Nakagami shadow fading. With the method proposed it is possible to obtain significant energy savings (up to ten times) with respect to fixed transmission rate and power.","authors":["Ruben Milocco","Paul Muhlethaler","Selma Boumerdassi"],"meta":["October 2020annals of telecommunications - annales des télécommunications 76(5)","DOI:10.1007/s12243-020-00815-x"],"references":["316851400_A_Survey_on_an_Energy-Efficient_and_Energy-Balanced_Routing_Protocol_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","282829924_Joint_Power_Control_and_Rate_Adaptation_for_Video_Streaming_in_Wireless_Networks_With_Time-Varying_Interference","273158482_Modeling_and_Analysis_of_Wireless_Channels_via_the_Mixture_of_Gaussian_Distribution","317548251_Fading_and_Shadowing_in_Wireless_Systems","304296924_Effects_of_Correlated_Shadowing_Modeling_on_Performance_Evaluation_of_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","287266465_Fading_and_Shadowing_in_Wireless_Systems","259162972_Improved_geographic_routing_in_sensor_networks_subjected_to_localization_errors","243498554_Transmission_Scheduling_Over_a_Fading_Channel_with_Energy_and_Deadline_Constraints","242562037_A_Note_on_Two_Problems_in_Connexion_with_Graphs","236157555_Wireless_Communications_First_Edition","221453599_Connectivity_of_Wireless_Multihop_Networks_in_a_Shadow_Fading_Environment","235671982_MIMO_wireless_communications","225070175_A_Note_on_Two_Problems_in_Connexion_With_Graphs","224078966_Minimum_Energy_Transmission_Over_a_Wireless_Channel_With_Deadline_and_Power_Constraints","221410517_Energy-efficient_routing_protocols_in_wireless_sensor_networks_for_health_communication_systems"]}
