{"id":"344333669_Improving_Construction_and_Demolition_Waste_Collection_Service_in_an_Urban_Area_Using_a_Simheuristic_Approach_A_Case_Study_in_Sydney_Australia","abstract":"Urbanization and population growth have resulted in a significant increase in the amount of 11 generated construction and demolition (C&D) waste worldwide. Improper C&D waste management has 12 led to a tremendous landfilled C&D waste, which has placed a great concern over its adverse impacts on 13 the environment and natural resources. Appropriate C&D waste recycling mechanism as a remedial action 14 saves our resources from deterioration, which can be guaranteed through a systematic apportion of the 15 construction projects to C&D waste recycling facilities. Previous studies in waste collection routing 16 problem have almost exclusively assumed that parameters are deterministic; however, uncertainty 17 associated with waste collection routing makes deterministic models inapplicable to real-life systems. To 18 tackle this problem, this research proposes a novel simheuristic based on an integrated simulation-19 optimization approach, in which an efficient hybrid Genetic Algorithm (GA) is applied in order to optimize 20 vehicle route planning for C&D waste collection from construction projects to recycling facilities. A 21 comparative analysis with existing well-known approaches is performed to represent the strength and 22 effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results demonstrate high performance of the proposed 23 simheuristic algorithm. This study has also benefited from a real case of construction projects apportion to 24 recycling facilities in Sydney, Australia for better evaluation. This research strongly contributes to 25 academics by lighting up the ways to optimize future waste collection problems in a wider range and more 26 precise manner. Meanwhile, this study recommends to C&D waste decision makers and practitioners to 27 allocate generated C&D waste to recycling facilities precisely with respect to the capacity of produced C&D 28 waste, capacity of recycling facilities, distances, and vehicle capacities. 29","authors":["Maziar Yazdani","Kamyar Kabirifar","Elijah Frimpong Boadu","Mahdi Shariati"],"meta":["September 2020Journal
