{"id":"288060405_Covering_Arrays_on_Product_Graphs","abstract":"Two vectors $x,y$ in $\\mathbb{Z}_g^n$ are $ qualitatively$ $ independent$ if\nfor all pairs $(a,b)\\in \\mathbb{Z}_g\\times \\mathbb{Z}_g$, there exists $i\\in\n\\{1,2,\\ldots,n\\}$ such that $(x_i,y_i)=(a,b)$. A covering array on a graph $G$,\ndenoted by $CA(n,G,g)$, is a $|V(G)|\\times n$ array on $\\mathbb{Z}_g$ with the\nproperty that any two rows which correspond to adjacent vertices in $G$ are\nqualitatively independent. The number of columns in such array is called its\n$size$. Given a graph $G$, a covering array on $G$ with minimum size is called\n$optimal$. Our primary concern in this paper is with constructions that make\noptimal covering arrays on large graphs those are obtained from product of\nsmaller graphs. We consider four most extensively studied graph products in\nliterature and give upper and lower bounds on the the size of covering arrays\non graph products. We find families of graphs for which the size of covering\narray on the Cartesian product achieves the lower bound. Finally, we present a\npolynomial time approximation algorithm with approximation ratio\n$\\log(\\frac{V}{2^{k-1}})$ for constructing covering array on graph $G=(V,E)$\nwith $k>1$ prime factors with respect to the Cartesian product.","authors":["Yasmeen Akhtar","Soumen Maity"],"meta":["July 2017Graphs and Combinatorics 33(4)","DOI:10.1007/s00373-017-1800-9","SourcearXiv","Project: Covering arrays and software testing"],"references":["267986107_On_Cartesian_skeletons_of_graphs","346681329_Handbook_of_Product_Graphs","344486692_Graphs_and_Homomorphisms","264993992_Handbook_of_Product_Graphs","264377551_Mixed_covering_Arrays_on_graphs","248390639_Graphs_with_Given_Group_and_Given_Graph_Theoretical_Properties","247801045_Cartesian_product_of_graphs","246355283_CRC_Handbook_of_Combinatorial_Designs","242489320_Prime_Numbers_and_Computer_Methods_for_Factorization","229932896_Covering_arrays_and_intersecting_codes","222666937_Problems_and_algorithms_for_covering_arrays","229884418_Covering_Arrays_with_Mixed_Alphabet_Sizes","227786339_Products_of_mixed_covering_arrays_of_strength_two","227264286_Graph_multiplication","222666354_Covering_Arrays_on_Graphs"]}
