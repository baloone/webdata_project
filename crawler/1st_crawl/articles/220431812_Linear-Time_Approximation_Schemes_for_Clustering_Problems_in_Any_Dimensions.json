{"id":"220431812_Linear-Time_Approximation_Schemes_for_Clustering_Problems_in_Any_Dimensions","abstract":"We present a general approach for designing approximation algorithms for a fundamental class of geometric clustering problems in arbitrary dimensions. More specifically, our approach leads to simple randomized algorithms for the k-means, k-median and discrete k-means problems that yield (1 + ε) approximations with probability ≥ 1/2 and running times of O(2(k/\") O(1) dn). These are the first algorithms for these problems whose running times are linear in the size of the input (nd for n points in d dimensions) assuming k and ε are fixed. Our method is general enough to be applicable to clustering problems satisfying certain simple properties and is likely to have further applications.","authors":["Amit Kumar","Yogish Sabharwal","Sandeep Sen"],"meta":["February 2010Journal of the ACM 57(2)","DOI:10.1145/1667053.1667054","SourceDBLP"],"references":["234804011_Applications_of_weighted_Voronoi_diagrams_and_randomization_to_variance-based-clustering","303802749_Indexing_by_Latent_Semantic_Analysis","248601167_Landauer_Indexing_by_Latent_Semantic_Analysis","243183177_On_k-Median_clustering_in_high_dimensions","238296058_Polynomial_Time_Approximation_Schemes_for_Euclidean_k-medians_and_related_problems","234829538_High-Dimensional_Computational_Geometry","232634249_Polynomial_time_approximation_schemes_for_Euclidean_TSP_and_other_geometric_problems","228057706_Indexing_By_Latent_Semantic_Analysis","227273551_On_Approximate_Geometric_k-Clustering","226238228_Efficient_and_Effective_Querying_by_Image_Content"]}
