{"id":"260947666_A_fast_solution_method_for_the_time-dependent_orienteering_problem","abstract":"This paper introduces a fast solution procedure to solve 100-node instances of the time-dependent orienteering problem (TD-OP) within a few seconds of computation time. Orienteering problems occur in logistic situations were an optimal combination of locations needs to be selected and the routing between the selected locations needs to be optimized. In the time-dependent variant, the travel time between two locations depends on the departure time at the first location. Next to a mathematical formulation of the TD-OP, the main contribution of this paper is the design of a fast and effective algorithm to tackle this problem. This algorithm combines the principles of an ant colony system (ACS) with a time-dependent local search procedure equipped with a local evaluation metric. Additionally, realistic benchmark instances with varying size and properties are constructed. The average score gap with the known optimal solution on these test instances is only 1.4% with an average computation time of 0.5 seconds. An extensive sensitivity analysis shows that the performance of the algorithm is insensitive to small changes in its parameter settings.","authors":["Cédric Verbeeck","Kenneth Sörensen","El-Houssaine Aghezzaf","Pieter Vansteenwegen"],"meta":["July 2014European Journal of Operational Research 236(2):419–432","DOI:10.1016/j.ejor.2013.11.038"],"references":["309124071_The_orienteering_problem","259687430_Applying_the_Ant_System_to_the_Vehicle_Routing_Problem","242933344_Time_Dependent_Vehicle_Routing_Problems_Formulations_Properties_and_Heuristic_Algorithms","236149501_Vehicle_Routing_with_Traffic_Congestion_and_Drivers'_Driving_and_Working_Rules","230856233_Heuristic_Methods_Applied_to_Orienteering","225659765_''Multiple_Neighbourhood''_Search_in_Commercial_VRP_Packages_Evolving_Towards_Self-Adaptive_Method","220825740_The_Team_Orienteering_Problem_Formulations_and_Branch-Cut_and_Price","220669191_Solving_the_Orienteering_Problem_through_Branch-and-Cut","220356252_A_Personalized_Tourist_Trip_Design_Algorithm_For_Mobile_Tourist_Guides","220340277_Vehicle_routing_with_stochastic_time-dependent_travel_times","2798782_Applying_the_ANT_System_to_the_Vehicle_Routing_Problem","2429351_Resource-Constrained_Geometric_Network_Optimization","297237209_THE_ORIENTEERING_PROBLEM_WITH_TIME_WINDOWS","265441311_An_Algorithm_for_Single_Constraint_Maximum_Collection_Problem","262270447_Vehicle_routing_and_scheduling_with_dynamic_travel_times","257551319_The_time_dependent_vehicle_routing_problem_with_time_windows_Benchmark_problems_an_efficient_solution_algorithm_and_solution_characteristics","251978015_Study_on_the_Time-Dependent_Orienteering_Problem","251367733_Model_and_Algorithm_for_Time-Dependent_Team_Orienteering_Problem","247936798_The_Orienteering_Problem_with_Time_Windows","241885239_Branch_and_Price_for_the_Time-Dependent_Vehicle_Routing_Problem_with_Time_Windows","237009173_Adaptive_self-adaptive_and_multi-level_metaheuristics","237009140_A_network-consistent_time-dependent_travel_time_layer_for_routing_optimization_problems","229341673_Integrating_public_transportation_in_personalised_electronic_tourist_guides","228625153_The_orienteering_problem_with_stochastic_profits","226104665_Using_a_Genetic_Algorithm_to_Solve_the_Generalized_Orienteering_Problem","223677299_The_real-time_time-dependent_vehicle_routing_problem","223651931_A_dynamic_vehicle_routing_problem_with_time-dependent_travel_times","223399204_Ants_can_solve_the_team_orienteering_problem","223181596_Approximation_algorithms_for_time-dependent_orienteering","222829081_Time_Dependent_Vehicle_Routing_Problem_with_a_Multi_Ant_Colony","222656982_Vehicle_routing_with_dynamic_travel_times_A_queueing_approach","222572129_Vehicle_Dispatching_With_Time_-_Dependent_Travel_Times","222236796_A_fast_and_effective_heuristic_for_the_orienteering_problem","220567912_The_Selective_Traveling_Salesman_Problem","220472874_An_Efficient_Four-Phase_Heuristic_for_the_Generalized_Orienteering_Problem","220472181_A_Heuristic_for_the_Multiple_Tour_Maximum_Collection_Problem","220471483_Vehicle_routing_under_time-dependent_travel_times_The_impact_of_congestion_avoidance","220413190_Time-Varying_Travel_Times_in_Vehicle_Routing","220289770_The_orienteering_problem_A_survey","220219506_Time-dependent_personal_tour_planning_and_scheduling_in_metropolises","220216378_The_City_Trip_Planner_An_expert_system_for_tourists","220209008_A_branch-and-cut_algorithm_for_the_undirected_selective_traveling_salesman_problem","220058920_Metaheuristics_for_the_bi-objective_orienteering_problem","200622136_Metaheuristics_From_Design_to_Implementation","200621988_The_Orienteering_Problem","35083238_Time_dependent_vehicle_routing_problems_microform_formulations_solution_algorithms_and_computational_experiments","28360536_Planning_in_tourism_and_public_transportation_Attraction_selection_by_means_of_a_personalised_electronic_tourist_guide_and_train_transfer_scheduling","4867012_A_Tabu_Search_heuristic_for_the_undirected_selective_traveling_salesman_problem"]}
