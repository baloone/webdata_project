{"id":"277931047_Education_in_Computational_Sciences","abstract":"The last two decades have witnessed an enormously rapid development of computational technologies which have undoubtedly affected all the fields of human activities, including education. In fact, computational science is one of the most evolving profile study programmes at technical universities nowadays. This article thus focuses on the description of the key content courses, curricula and degrees offered within the study programmes at the Faculty of Informatics and Management of the University of Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic. Moreover, this study characterizes teaching and learning of university undergraduate computational professionals with a special focus on core competences such as an ability to identify and solve problems, knowledge of analytical methods, or operating systems, but also on active and passive knowledge of English since English as lingua franca can help these professionals together with other core competences succeed in the job market after their graduation.","authors":["Petra Poulov√°","Blanka Klimova"],"meta":["December 2015Procedia Computer Science 51(1):1996-2005","DOI:10.1016/j.procs.2015.05.464","Project: ICT and University Education"],"references":["300398210_Personalized_Learning_and_Assessment","290071619_Forms_of_Instruction_and_Students'_Preferences_-_A_Comparative_Study","285339659_Flexible_e-learning_Online_courses_tailored_to_student's_needs","284626692_ICT_in_the_teaching_of_academic_writing","281459051_Current_Social_Media_Landscape","313622229_Analysis_of_online_materials_and_their_impact_on_learning","291787150_Learningteaching_styles_Potent_forces_behind_them","284626560_Impact_of_e-learning_on_stu-dents'_study_results","281228178_On_forming_key_competences_within_the_ICT-supported_instruction_in_higher_education","275779388_English_for_Specific_Purposes_A_Learning-Centred_Approach","275226299_Comparison_of_on-line_Teaching_and_Face-to-face_Teaching","261487282_Didactic_reflection_of_learning_preferences_in_IT_and_managerial_fields_of_study","273117675_Collaborative_Learning","271461724_Study_materials_in_online_courses_analysis_reflecting_individual_learning_styles","270082675_Collaborative_Learning"]}
