{"id":"285993130_An_Overview_of_Psychosocial_Symptoms_in_Obese_Children","abstract":"Considering the pervasive nature of childhood obesity, there is an increased need to investigate the effects of obesity on a child's physical and psychosocial health. Although the physical health effects of obesity have been widely documented, much less is known about the psychosocial consequences of excess weight in children. Despite this lack, there is recent speculation that the psychosocial consequences of excess weight are more prevalent than the physical health consequences. A number of psychosocial constructs are examined in relation to obesity. These include self-esteem, depression, social functioning, eating disorder psychopathology, quality of life, body dissatisfaction, and bias and discrimination. This chapter discusses each of these issues in detail.","authors":["Lisa Y.
