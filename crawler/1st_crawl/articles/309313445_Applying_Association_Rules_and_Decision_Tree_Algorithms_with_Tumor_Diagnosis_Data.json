{"id":"309313445_Applying_Association_Rules_and_Decision_Tree_Algorithms_with_Tumor_Diagnosis_Data","abstract":"In the last decade, Tumor diagnosis data received a lot of attention and researches due to its importance. The development of the hardware and software technologies led to necessity for tools not to store them but also to analyze these medical records and find results to support decisions. Association rules and decision tree are interested mining algorithms which can be used to find and explore relations between attributes in a data set. In this paper, association rules and decision tree algorithms are applied with tumor data set in order to get analytical results to support medical decisions. The results can be depended in early detection of tumor rather than to provide a second opinion for clinicians. Data mining algorithms are applied on 7544 medical diagnosis cases from more than 10 medical centers in Basra, Iraq.","authors":["Alaa Khalaf"],"meta":["August 2016"],"references":["267424175_Ensemble_Decision_Tree_Classifier_For_Breast_Cancer_Data","252993672_Performance_Evaluation_of_Decision_Tree_Classifiers_on_Medical_Datasets","220017784_Data_Mining_Practical_Machine_Learning_Tools_and_Techniques","49595591_Data_Mining_Algorithms_And_Medical_Sciences","41822936_Comparative_Analysis_of_Serial_Decision_Tree_Classification_Algorithms","316600283_Data_Mining_Concepts_and_Techniques","313385761_Data_Mining_Practical_Machine_Learning_Tools_and_Techniques","268017225_Data_mining_Theories_algorithms_and_examples","228084513_Association_Rules_Mining_A_Recent_Overview","11970575_Data_Mining_with_Decision_Trees_For_Diagnosis_of_Breast_Tumor_in_Medical_Ultrasonic_Images"]}
