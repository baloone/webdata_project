In computer vision, the main scientific issues are\nmachine learning, surface reconstruction, inverse optics and\nintegration, model acquisition, and perception and action. In speech and\nnatural language processing (SNLP), issues were identified statistical\nanalysis in corpus-based speech and language understanding, search\nstrategies for language analysis, auditory and vocal-tract modeling,\nintegration of multiple levels of speech and language analyses, and\nconnectionist systems. In AI, important issues that need immediate\nattention include the development of efficient machine learning and\nheuristic search methods that can adapt to different architectural\nconfigurations, and the design and construction of scalable and\nverifiable knowledge bases, active memories, and artificial neural\nnetworks","authors":["Benjamin W Wah","T.S.
