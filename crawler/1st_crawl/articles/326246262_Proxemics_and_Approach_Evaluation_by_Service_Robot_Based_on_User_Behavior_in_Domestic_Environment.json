{"id":"326246262_Proxemics_and_Approach_Evaluation_by_Service_Robot_Based_on_User_Behavior_in_Domestic_Environment","abstract":"Intelligent service robots are used at a significant level to uplift the living standards of domestic users. These robots are expected to possess human-friendly interactive features. Service robots should be able to provide a variety of tasks to support independent living of users in domestic environments. Therefore, a service robot often needs to approach users to execute these services and the approach toward the users should be human friendly. In order to achieve this, proxemics planner of a service robot should be cable of deciding the\napproaching proxemics based on user behavior. This paper proposes a method to decide the approaching proxemics based on the behavior of the user. A fuzzy interference system has been designed to decide the proxemics based on the user behavior identified through body parameters. This leads to an effective interaction mechanism initiated by a robot in such a way that the approaching scenario looks more human-like. The proposed concept has been implemented on MIRob\nplatform and experiments were conducted in an artificially created domestic environment. The experimental results of the proposed system have been compared with results of a human study to evaluate the performance of the system.","authors":["Bhagya Samarakoon","Chapa Sirithunge","Viraj Muthugala","Buddhika Jayasekara"],"meta":["October 2018","DOI:10.1109/IROS.2018.8593713","Conference: 2018 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS),At: Madrid, Spain","Project: MIRob (Moratuwa Intelligent Robot): an interactive  mobile service robot for domestic environments"],"references":["325957304_Replicating_Natural_Approaching_Behavior_of_Humans_for_Improving_Robot's_Approach_toward_Two_Persons_During_a_Conversation","287126682_Physical_Human_Activity_Recognition_Using_Wearable_Sensors","284283061_The_evaluation_of_different_roles_for_domestic_social_robots","282534232_Service_robot_system_with_an_informationally_structured_environment","319276978_A_neuro-fuzzy-Bayesian_approach_for_the_adaptive_control_of_robot_proxemics_behavior","311086291_Robust_comprehension_of_natural_language_instructions_by_a_domestic_service_robot","304188753_Analysis_of_Elderly_Users'_Preferences_and_Expectations_on_Service_Robot's_Personality_Appearance_and_Interaction","303689372_MIRob_An_intelligent_service_robot_that_learns_from_interactive_discussions_while_handling_uncertain_information_in_user_instructions","301914496_Results_of_a_real_world_trial_with_a_mobile_social_service_robot_for_older_adults","286573343_Human_activity_recognition_based_on_the_combined_SVMHMM"]}
