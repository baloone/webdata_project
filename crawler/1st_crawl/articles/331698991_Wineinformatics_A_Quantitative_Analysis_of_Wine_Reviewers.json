{"id":"331698991_Wineinformatics_A_Quantitative_Analysis_of_Wine_Reviewers","abstract":"Data Science is a successful study that incorporates varying techniques and theories from distinct fields including Mathematics, Computer Science, Economics, Business and domain knowledge. Among all components in data science, domain knowledge is the key to create high quality data products by data scientists. Wineinformatics is a new data science application that uses wine as the domain knowledge and incorporates data science and wine related datasets, including physicochemical laboratory data and wine reviews. This paper produces a brand-new dataset that contains more than 100,000 wine reviews made available by the Computational Wine Wheel. This dataset is then used to quantitatively evaluate the consistency of the Wine Spectator and all of its major reviewers through both white-box and black-box classification algorithms. Wine Spectator reviewers receive more than 87% accuracy when evaluated with the SVM method. This result supports Wine Spectatorâ€™s prestigious standing in the wine industry.","authors":["Bernard Chen","Valentin Velchev","James Palmer","Travis Atkison"],"meta":["September 2018Fermentation 4(4)","DOI:10.3390/fermentation4040082"],"references":["277939169_Analyses_of_Wine-Tasting_Data_A_Tutorial","273780770_Wineinformatics_Applying_Data_Mining_on_Wine_Sensory_Reviews_Processed_by_the_Computational_Wine_Wheel","312538118_Support-vector_networks","304480193_Understanding_the_Wine_Judges_and_Evaluating_the_Consistency_Through_White-Box_Classification_Algorithms","300415128_Wineinformatics_Uncork_Napa's_Cabernet_Sauvignon_by_Association_Rule_Based_Classification","282600486_Machine_Learning_in_Fine_Wine_Price_Prediction","277937170_Introduction_to_the_Issue","276831499_Evaluating_Wine-Tasting_Results_and_Randomness_with_a_Mixture_of_Rank_Preference_Models","260325049_Data_Mining_with_Big_Data","259424411_Reliability_and_Consensus_of_Experienced_Wine_Judges_Expertise_Within_and_Between"]}
