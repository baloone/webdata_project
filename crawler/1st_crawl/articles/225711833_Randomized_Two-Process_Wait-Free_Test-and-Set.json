{"id":"225711833_Randomized_Two-Process_Wait-Free_Test-and-Set","abstract":"We present the rst explicit, and currently simplest, randomized algorithm for 2-process wait-free test-andset. It is implemented with two 4-valued single writer single reader atomic variables. A test-and-set takes at most 11 expected elementary steps, while a reset takes exactly 1 elementary step. Based on a nite-state analysis, the proofs of correctness and expected length are compressed into one table.
