{"id":"2701481_Molecular_Computation_Of_Solutions_To_Combinatorial_Problems","abstract":"The tools of molecular biology were used to solve an instance of the directed Hamiltonian path problem. A small graph was\nencoded in molecules of DNA, and the \"operations\" of the computation were performed with standard protocols and enzymes. This\nexperiment demonstrates the feasibility of carrying out computations at the molecular level.","authors":["Leonard M. Adleman","Professor Leonard","M.
