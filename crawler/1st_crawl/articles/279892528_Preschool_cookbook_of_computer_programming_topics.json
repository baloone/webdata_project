{"id":"279892528_Preschool_cookbook_of_computer_programming_topics","abstract":"A common problem in computer programming use for education in general, not simply as a technical skill, is that children and teachers find themselves constrained by what is possible through limited expertise in computer programming techniques. This is particularly noticeable at the preliterate level, where constructs tend to be limited to extremely simple elements. Having worked for 4 years with over 150 children, aged 3 to 5, we present age-appropriate computer programming activities involving different computer programming techniques, from the basic (computer language syntax) to the advanced (client-server). These may contribute to expand the panorama on viable computer programming techniques available to children and educators, thus broadening the variety of educational activities and projects that can be approached in educational settings using computer programming.","authors":["Leonel Morgado","Maria Cruz","Ken Kahn"],"meta":["May 2010Australasian Journal of Educational Technology 26(3):309-326","DOI:10.14742/ajet.1077"],"references":["289744815_TEL_practices_in_preschool_and_kindergarten_education_Integrating_computer_use_and_computer_programming_in_off-computer_activities","259668770_Framework_for_Computer_Programming_in_Preschool_and_Kindergarten","259597299_A_Robot_in_Kindergarten","255632182_The_Future_of_Educational_Computing_ResearchThe_Case_of_Computer_Programming","246157454_Face-to-face_and_online_collaboration_Appreciating_rules_and_adding_complexity","314721698_A_physical_interface_for_system_dynamics_simulation","269949286_Concept_Learning_in_Preschool_Children_Effects_of_a_Short-Term_Logo_Experience","262275062_Generalizing_by_removing_detail_how_any_program_can_be_created_by_working_with_examples","246676439_LEGO_Engineer_and_RoboLab_Teaching_Engineering_with_LabVIEW_from_Kindergarten_to_Graduate_School","245753688_Computers_and_Squeak_as_Environments_for_Learning"]}
