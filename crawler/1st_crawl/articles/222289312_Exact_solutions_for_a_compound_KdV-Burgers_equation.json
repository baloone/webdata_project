{"id":"222289312_Exact_solutions_for_a_compound_KdV-Burgers_equation","abstract":"The exact solutions of a compound KdV-Burgers equation are obtained by using a homogeneous balance method. Particular important cases of the equation, such as the compound KdV, mKdV-Burgers, KdV-Burgers as well as mKdV, KdV equations can be solved by this method.","authors":["Mingliang Wang"],"meta":["April 1996Physics Letters A 213(5-6):279-287","DOI:10.1016/0375-9601(96)00103-X"],"references":["231968921_Traveling-wave_solutions_to_the_Korteweg-de_Vries-Burgers_equation","258277005_The_proper_analytical_solution_of_the_Korteweg-de_Vries-Burgers_equation","256221664_The_Korteweg-de_Vries-Burgers_equation","247575490_Solitary_wave_solutions_for_variant_Boussinesq_equations","231829529_A_non-linear_equation_incorporating_damping_and_dispersion"]}
