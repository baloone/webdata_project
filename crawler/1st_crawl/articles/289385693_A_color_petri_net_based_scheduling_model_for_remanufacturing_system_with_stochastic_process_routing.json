{"id":"289385693_A_color_petri_net_based_scheduling_model_for_remanufacturing_system_with_stochastic_process_routing","abstract":"This paper presents a remanufacturing process planning and resource scheduling method. A color Petri net is proposed to model the dynamics in remanufacturing, such as various process routings and different processing times for components in the same process. A hybrid meta-heuristic using simulated annealing and tabu search is also proposed to derive the optimal process plan and schedule that minimize the total processing cost and tardiness penalty. The approach is demonstrated through the remanufacturing of used machine tool.","authors":["Lingling Li","Congbo Li","Ying Tang"],"meta":["August 2014","DOI:10.1109/CoASE.2014.6899368"],"references":["272778663_A_Simulated_Annealing-Based_Heuristic_Algorithm_for_Job_Shop_Scheduling_to_Minimize_Lateness","258651704_Integrating_Genetic_Algorithm_Tabu_Search_and_Simulated_Annealing_For_Job_Shop_Scheduling_Proble","258233736_Solving_Flexible_Job-Shop_Scheduling_Problem_Using_Gravitational_Search_Algorithm_and_Colored_Petri_Net","257337906_A_tabu_search_algorithm_for_unrelated_parallel_machine_scheduling_with_sequence-_and_machine-dependent_setups_Minimizing_total_tardiness","220106090_A_Tabu_Search_Algorithm_for_Scheduling_Independent_Jobs_in_Computational_Grids","295097461_Load_Information_Based_Priority_Dependant_Heuristic_for_Manpower_Scheduling_Problem_in_Remanufacturing","284016784_A_Novel_Improved_Discrete_ABC_Algorithm_for_Manpower_Scheduling_Problem_in_Remanufacturing","262235711_Hybrid_discrete_harmony_search_algorithm_for_scheduling_re-processing_problem_in_remanufacturing","261621053_Priority_scheduling_policies_for_repair_shops","261418551_Uncertainty_management_in_remanufacturing_A_review","260662548_A_Modeling_Approach_to_Analyze_Variability_of_Remanufacturing_Process_Routing","258518198_A_hybrid_simulated_annealing_based_heuristic_for_solving_the_location-routing_problem_with_fuzzy_demands","253233303_Multi-product_economic_lot_scheduling_problem_with_manufacturing_and_remanufacturing_using_a_basic_period_policy","229452300_Economic_Lot_Scheduling_Problem_with_Returns","223722268_Multi-product_economic_lot_scheduling_problem_with_separate_production_lines_for_manufacturing_and_remanufacturing","220347083_Coloured_Petri_net_scheduling_models_Timed_state_space_exploration_shortages","4872353_Performance_of_static_priority_rules_for_shared_facilities_in_a_remanufacturing_shop_with_disassembly_and_reassembly"]}
