{"id":"332332298_Automated_Assessment_and_Monitoring_Support_for_Competency-Based_Courses","abstract":"Competency-Based Education is becoming increasingly adopted by higher education institutions all over the world. This paper presents a framework that assists instructors in this pedagogical paradigm, and its corresponding open-source implementation. The framework supports the formal definition of competency assessment models and the students' evaluation under these models. It also provides distinct learning analytics for identifying course shortcomings and validating corrective actions instructors have introduced in a course. Finally, this paper reports the benefits of applying our framework to an engineering course at the Pontifical Catholic University of Valparaíso in Chile for three years.
