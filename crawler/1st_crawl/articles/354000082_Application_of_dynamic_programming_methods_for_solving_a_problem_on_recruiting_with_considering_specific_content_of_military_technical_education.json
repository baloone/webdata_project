One of the key topics in such courses as higher mathematics and computer science in all civil and military technical universities is the optimization theory, familiarization with which is based on learning methods for solving a transport task, assignment problem, traveling salesman problem and others. An effective solution to this type of tasks is possible through automated computing tools, tabular processors, and programming systems. The specifics of training cadets at military universities dictates the need to formulate tasks with a focus on military-technical research. Optimization issues are considered as applied to possible real situations in the military service of future officers. The staffing task is solved through high-level programming. Some results of the comparative analysis of educational material assimilation in the control and experimental groups are given. A deeper understanding of the theoretical material by the cadets and confident practical knowledge of programming technologies and solving problems in general with the specified training approach are noted, and its confirmed by the results of the tests conducted by the authors of the paper.","authors":["Tatiana Evgenjevna Tarasova","Anatoly Vladimirovich Tarasov","Tatiana Sergeevna Smirnova"],"meta":["June 2021","DOI:10.17816/snv2021102315"],"references":[]}
