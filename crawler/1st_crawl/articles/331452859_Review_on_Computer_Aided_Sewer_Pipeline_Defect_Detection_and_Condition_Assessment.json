{"id":"331452859_Review_on_Computer_Aided_Sewer_Pipeline_Defect_Detection_and_Condition_Assessment","abstract":"Physical and operational inspection of sewer pipelines is critical to sustaining an acceptable level of system serviceability. Emerging inspection tools in addition to developments in sensor and lens technologies have facilitated sewer condition assessment and increased the quality and consistency of provided data. Meanwhile, sewer networks are too vast to be adequately investigated manually so the development of innovative computer vision techniques for automation applications has become an interest point of recent studies. This review paper presents the current state of inspection technology practices in sewer pipelines. An overall inspection tool comparison was conducted and the advantages and disadvantages of each method were discussed. This was followed by a comprehensive review of recent studies on visual inspection automation using computer vision and machine learning techniques. Finally, current achievements and limitations of existing automation methods were debated to outline open challenges and future research for both infrastructure management and computer science researchers.","authors":["Saeed Moradi","Tarek Zayed","Farzaneh Golkhoo"],"meta":["March 2019Infrastructures","DOI:10.3390/infrastructures4010010"],"references":["318893198_Real-Time_Defect_Detection_in_Sewer_Closed_Circuit_Television_Inspection_Videos","334882438_Condition_assessment_of_the_buried_utility_service_infrastructure","328664779_Automated_detection_of_faults_in_sewers_using_CCTV_image_sequences","327702091_Automated_detection_of_sewer_pipe_defects_in_closed-circuit_television_images_using_deep_learning_techniques","326330793_Automated_Sewer_Pipeline_Inspection_Using_Computer_Vision_Techniques","326100365_Automated_defect_classification_in_sewer_closed_circuit_television_inspections_using_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","324867318_Automated_defect_detection_tool_for_closed_circuit_television_cctv_inspected_sewer_pipelines","324121658_Utilizing_text_recognition_for_the_defects_extraction_in_sewers_CCTV_inspection_videos","300482645_Segmentation_of_Crack_and_Open_Joint_in_Sewer_Pipelines_Based_on_CCTV_Inspection_Images","290215461_Computerized_Sewer_Pipe_Condition_Assessment"]}
