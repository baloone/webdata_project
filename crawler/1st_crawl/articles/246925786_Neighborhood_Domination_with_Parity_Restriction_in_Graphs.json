{"id":"246925786_Neighborhood_Domination_with_Parity_Restriction_in_Graphs","abstract":"An odd-neighborhood dominating set of a graph G(V,E) is a vertex set S⊂V such that every closed neighborhood N[v], v∈V, contains an odd number of vertices in S. It is known that every graph G has an odd-neighborhood dominating set. Clearly the empty set is an even-neighborhood dominating set for every graph G. We consider the problem of determining graphs for which a π-neighborhood dominating set exists for every parity assignment π on its vertices. The problem of determining the minimum cardinality odd-neighborhood dominating set of a graph G is known to be NP-hard, however a linear algorithm for the problem is known for the case when G is a tree. We present a linear algorithm for the more general class of series-parallel graphs and for arbitrary parity assignments.","authors":["A. Amin","P. Slater"],"meta":["January 1992"],"references":[]}
