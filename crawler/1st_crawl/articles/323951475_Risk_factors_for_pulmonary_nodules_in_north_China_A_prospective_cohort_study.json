{"id":"323951475_Risk_factors_for_pulmonary_nodules_in_north_China_A_prospective_cohort_study","abstract":"Objectives\nPulmonary nodules have become common incidental findings with the widespread use of computed tomography (CT) technology. Such nodules have the potential to become early lung cancer lesions, so understanding more about factors that may be associated with them is important.\n\nMaterials and methods\nThe present work was based on a large prospective cohort comprising 32,438 participants in Hebei Province (China) between January 2014 and March 2016. Participants aged 40â€“75 years completed a questionnaire, underwent low-dose CT (LDCT), and were followed up to March 2017. Grouped by the results of LDCT, normal participants and those with pulmonary nodules were included in the data analysis.\n\nResults\nIn total 7752 subjects were included in this study, of whom 2040 (26.32%) were pulmonary nodule patients. Older age, current smoking status (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.43, 95% confidence interval (95%CI): 1.21, 1.68), exposure to second-hand smoke (SHS) at work (HR = 1.17, 95%CI: 1.01, 1.35), dust exposure (HR = 1.49, 95%CI: 1.06, 2.11), history of lung disease (HR = 1.44, 95%CI: 1.16, 1.77), and family history of cancer (HR = 1.28, 95%CI: 1.12, 1.48) were associated with pulmonary nodules. However, consumption of vegetables (HR = 0.82, 95%CI: 0.68, 0.99), tea (HR = 0.88, 95%CI: 0.78, 0.99) and legumes reduced the risk. Approximately 10.09% and 8.58% of pulmonary nodule incidences were attributed to tobacco smoking and low fruit intake, respectively. An estimated 6.36% and 3.88% of patients with pulmonary nodules attributable to family history of cancer and history of lung disease were detected.\n\nConclusion\nThe results of this study suggest that age, smoking, SHS, dietary factors, occupational exposures, history of disease and family history of cancer may affect the incidence of pulmonary nodules.","authors":["Yu-Tong He","Ya-Chen
