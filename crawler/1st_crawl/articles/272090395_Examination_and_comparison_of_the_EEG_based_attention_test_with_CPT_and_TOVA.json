{"id":"272090395_Examination_and_comparison_of_the_EEG_based_attention_test_with_CPT_and_TOVA","abstract":"Attention as a focusing and concentrating ability have great importance in doing daily tasks precisely and adequately; furthermore, it is a significant factor in the learning process. In this paper, besides some attention and concentration measuring methods, an innovative EEG-based measuring and examination technique of continuous attention will be demonstrated. The results of these different methods have been compared and evaluated in this research. The most significant advantage of the EEG-based attention measuring method is the possibility of time continuous examination that can shortly provide information about the actual mental state of the test subject. This information can be useful in teaching and applying the most convenient method of sharing and acquiring knowledge; therefore, it can virtually improve the result of learning.","authors":["Jozsef Katona"],"meta":["November 2014","DOI:10.1109/CINTI.2014.7028659","Conference: 15th IEEE International Symposium on Computational Intelligence and InformaticsAt: Budapest, HungaryVolume: 2014"],"references":["269305169_Evaluation_of_the_NeuroSky_MindFlex_EEG_headset_brain_waves_data","237125318_Models_of_Overt_Attention","225579079_Real-Time_Modeling_of_an_Electro-hydraulic_Servo_System","224606126_Influence_of_cylinder_leakage_on_dynamic_behavior_of_electrohydraulic_servo_system","258853238_The_psychology_experiment_building_language_PEBL_and_PEBL_test_battery","226185591_Use_of_the_abikoff_classroom_observation_coding_system_on_a_children's_inpatient_psychiatric_unit","203918065_Brain-Machine_Interfaces_Past_Present_and_Future","14791675_Developmental_Normative_Data_on_The_Test_of_Variables_of_Attention_TOVA","13660271_Clinical_utility_of_the_Test_of_Variables_of_Attention_TOVA_in_the_diagnosis_of_attention-deficithyperactivity_disorder","10199746_A_Continuous_Performance_Test_of_Brain-Damage"]}
