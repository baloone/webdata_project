{"id":"334405383_Age_Prediction_Based_on_Brain_MRI_Image_A_Survey","abstract":"Human age prediction is an interesting and applicable issue in different fields. It can be based on various criteria such as face image, DNA methylation, chest plate radiographs, knee radiographs, dental images and etc. Most of the age prediction researches have mainly been based on images. Since the image processing and Machine Learning (ML) techniques have grown up, the investigations were led to use them in age prediction problem. The implementations would be used in different fields, especially in medical applications. Brain Age Estimation (BAE) has attracted more attention in recent years and it would be so helpful in early diagnosis of some neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer, Parkinson, Huntington, etc. BAE is performed on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images to compute the brain ages. Studies based on brain MRI shows that there is a relation between accelerated aging and accelerated brain atrophy. This refers to the effects of neurodegenerative diseases on brain structure while making the whole of it older. This paper reviews and summarizes the main approaches for age prediction based on brain MRI images including preprocessing methods, useful tools used in different research works and the estimation algorithms. We categorize the BAE methods based on two factors, first the way of processing MRI images, which includes pixel-based, surface-based, or voxel-based methods and second, the generation of ML algorithms that includes traditional or Deep Learning (DL) methods. The modern techniques as DL methods help MRI based age prediction to get results that are more accurate. In recent years, more precise and statistical ML approaches have been utilized with the help of related tools for simplifying computations and getting accurate results. Pros and cons of each research and the challenges in each work are expressed and some guidelines and deliberations for future research are suggested.","authors":["Hedieh Sajedi","Nastaran Pardakhti"],"meta":["July 2019Journal of Medical Systems 43(8)","DOI:10.1007/s10916-019-1401-7","Project: Brain Age Estimation (BAE) by MRI images"],"references":["329063716_Pathological_Brain_Detection_based_on_AlexNet_and_Transfer_Learning","327157869_Biological_Brain_Age_Prediction_Using_Cortical_Thickness_Data_A_Large_Scale_Cohort_Study","323125019_Bayesian_Optimization_for_Neuroimaging_Pre-processing_in_Brain_Age_Classification_and_Prediction","322038024_Classification_using_Deep_Learning_Neural_Networks_for_Brain_Tumors","321750158_Classification_of_Brain_MRI_Tumor_Images_A_Hybrid_Approach","342926842_Predicting_brain_age_with_deep_learning_from_raw_imaging_data_results_in_a_reliable_and_heritable_biomarker","332515089_Age_Prediction_based_on_Brain_MRI_Images_using_Extreme_Learning_Machine","329559254_Brain_Tumor_Classification_via_Convolutional_Neural_Network_and_Extreme_Learning_Machines","323400183_An_image_analysis-aided_method_for_redundancy_reduction_in_differentiation_of_identical_Actinobacterial_strains","322882102_A_validation_study_of_DNA_methylation-based_age_prediction_using_semen_in_forensic_casework_samples"]}
