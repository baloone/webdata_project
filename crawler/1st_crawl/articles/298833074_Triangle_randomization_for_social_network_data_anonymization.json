{"id":"298833074_Triangle_randomization_for_social_network_data_anonymization","abstract":"In order to protect privacy of social network participants, network graph data should be anonymised prior to its release. Most proposals in the literature aim to achieve k-anonymity under specific assumptions about the background information available to the attacker. Our method is based on randomizing the location of the triangles in the graph. We show that this simple method preserves the main structural parameters of the graph to a high extent, while providing a high re-identification confusion.","authors":["Ljiljana Brankovic","Nacho LÃ³pez","Mirka Miller","Francesc Sebe"],"meta":["June 2014Ars Mathematica Contemporanea 7(2):461-477","DOI:10.26493/1855-3974.220.34c"],"references":["228704496_A_clustering_approach_for_data_and_structural_anonymity_in_social_networks","221103030_K-Symmetry_model_for_identity_anonymization_in_social_networks","220538611_Resisting_structural_identification_in_anonymized_social_networks","283617410_Emergence_of_Scaling_in_Random_Networks","273354153_The_Spread_of_Obesity_in_a_Large_Social_Network_Over_32_Years","237434250_SUPPLEMENTARY_ONLINE_MATERIAL_FOR_THE_SPREAD_OF_OBESITY_IN_A_LARGE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_OVER_32_YEARS","233636663_Victim_target_networks_as_solvability_factors_in_serial_murder","221214038_Towards_Identity_Anonymization_on_Graphs","200775167_Structure_and_Evolution_of_Online_Social_Networks","44586199_Smoking-based_selection_and_influence_in_gender-segregated_friendship_networks_A_social_network_analysis_of_adolescent_smoking","23571732_Dynamic_Spread_of_Happiness_in_a_Large_Social_Network_Longitudinal_Analysis_Over_20_Years_in_the_Framingham_Heart_Study","12779869_Albert_R_Emergence_of_Scaling_in_Random_Networks_Science_286_509-512","11497687_Growing_Scale-Free_Networks_with_Tunable_Clustering","13660517_Collective_Dynamics_of_Small_World_Networks","12179403_The_structure_of_scientific_collaboration_networks"]}
