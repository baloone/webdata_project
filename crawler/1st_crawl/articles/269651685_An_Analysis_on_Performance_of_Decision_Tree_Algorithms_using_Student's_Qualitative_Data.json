{"id":"269651685_An_Analysis_on_Performance_of_Decision_Tree_Algorithms_using_Student's_Qualitative_Data","abstract":"Decision Tree is the most widely applied supervised classification technique. The learning and classification steps of decision tree induction are simple and fast and it can be applied to any domain. In this research student qualitative data has been taken from educational data mining and the performance analysis of the decision tree algorithm ID3, C4.5 and CART are compared. The comparison result shows that the Gini Index of CART influence information Gain Ratio of ID3 and C4.5. The classification accuracy of CART is higher when compared to ID3 and C4.5. However the difference in classification accuracy between the decision tree algorithms is not considerably higher. The experimental results of decision tree indicate that studentâ€™s performance also influenced by qualitative factors.","authors":["T. Miranda Lakshmi","Martin Aruldoss","R.Mumtaj Begum","V.
