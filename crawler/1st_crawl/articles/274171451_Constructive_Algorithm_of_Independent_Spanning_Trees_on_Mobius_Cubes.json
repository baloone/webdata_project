{"id":"274171451_Constructive_Algorithm_of_Independent_Spanning_Trees_on_Mobius_Cubes","abstract":"Independent spanning trees (ISTs) on networks have applications in networks such as reliable communication protocols, the multi-node broadcasting, one-to-all broadcasting, reliable broadcasting and secure message distribution. However, there is a problem on ISTs on graphs: If a graph G is n-connected (n >= 1), then there are n ISTs rooted at an arbitrary vertex on G. This problem has remained open for n >= 5. In this paper, we consider the construction of ISTs on Mobius cubes-a class of hypercube variants. An O(N log N) recursive algorithm is proposed to construct n ISTs rooted at an arbitrary vertex on the n-dimensional Mobius cube M-n, where N=2(n) is the number of vertices in M-n. Furthermore, we prove that each IST obtained by our algorithm is isomorphic to an n-level binomial-like tree with the height n+1 for n >= 2.","authors":["Baolei Cheng","Jianxi Fan","Xiaohua Jia","Shukui Zhang"],"meta":["October 2012The Computer Journal 56(11):1347-1362","DOI:10.1093/comjnl/bxs123"],"references":["221450180_Independent_Spanning_Trees_on_Folded_Hypercubes","220587447_Optimal_Independent_Spanning_Trees_on_Hypercubes","220329881_Independent_Spanning_Trees_on_Multidimensional_Torus_Networks","220246127_Wide_Diameter_of_Mobius_Cubes","220181100_Constructing_Multiple_Independent_Spanning_Trees_on_Recursive_circulant_Graphs_G2","4139026_Fault-Hamiltonicity_of_Hypercube-Like_Interconnection_Networks","3301188_Reducing_the_Height_of_Independent_Spanning_Trees_in_Chordal_Rings","3045079_Pancyclicity_on_the_Mbius_cube_with_both_faulty_nodes_and_faulty_edges","3044785_The_Diagnosability_of_the_Matching_Composition_Network_under_the_Comparison_Diagnosis_Model","264719533_Three_tree-paths","242790259_On_the_independent_spanning_trees_of_recursive_circulant_graphs_GcdmdGcdmd_with_d2d2","227103332_Independent_trees_in_graphs","226950322_A_Linear-Time_Algorithm_to_Find_Four_Independent_Spanning_Trees_in_Four-Connected_Planar_Graphs","223853286_Reliable_broadcasting_in_product_networks","223334847_Pancyclicity_on_Mobius_cubes_with_maximal_edge_faults","223085074_Finding_nonseparating_induced_cycles_and_independent_spanning_trees_in_3-connected_graphs","222814706_Parallel_construction_of_optimal_independent_spanning_trees_on_hypercubes","222437007_Rodeh_M_The_multi-tree_approach_to_reliability_in_distributed_networks_Inform_Comput_79_43-59","222348204_Hamilton-connectivity_and_cycle-embedding_of_the_Mobius_cubes","222175978_Embedding_of_meshes_in_Mobius_cubes","221544009_Edge-Pancyclicity_of_Twisted_Cubes","220908199_Hamiltonicity_of_Matching_Composition_Networks_with_Conditional_Edge_Faults","220752925_Independent_Spanning_Trees_of_Product_Graphs","220618379_Finding_Four_Independent_Trees","220616592_Disjoint_Rooted_Spanning_Trees_with_Small_Depths_in_deBruijn_and_Kautz_Graphs","220533621_Pancyclicity_of_Restricted_Hypercube-Like_Networks_under_the_Conditional_Fault_Model","220397812_Independent_Trees_in_Planar_Graphs_Independent_trees","220379349_Independent_spanning_trees_on_twisted_cubes","220359122_Optimal_Independent_Spanning_Trees_on_Odd_Graphs","220339166_Multi-node_broadcasting_in_all-ported_3-D_wormhole-routed_torus_using_an_aggregation-then-distribution_strategy","220315018_Embedding_meshes_into_locally_twisted_cubes","220314958_Embedding_meshes_into_twisted-cubes","220314376_Independent_spanning_trees_on_even_networks","220209086_Independent_spanning_trees_on_folded_hyper-stars","220155182_Constructing_independent_spanning_trees_for_locally_twisted_cubes","220151713_Constructing_edge-disjoint_spanning_trees_in_locally_twisted_cubes","220113923_Edge-pancyclicity_of_Mobius_cubes","220111882_Paths_in_Mobius_cubes_and_crossed_cubes","220110885_Hamiltonian_properties_on_the_class_of_hypercube-like_networks","220055472_Pancyclicity_of_Mobius_cubes_with_faulty_nodes","32164419_Independent_Spanning_Trees_of_Chordal_Rings","3726598_Reliable_Broadcasting_and_Secure_Distributing_in_Channel_Networks","3300330_Efficient_broadcasting_in_wormhole-routed_multicomputers_A_network-partitioning_approach","3300295_Diagnosability_of_the_Mobius_cubes","3043496_The_Mobius_cubes"]}
