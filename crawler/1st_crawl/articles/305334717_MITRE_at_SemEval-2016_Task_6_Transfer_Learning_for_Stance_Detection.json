{"id":"305334717_MITRE_at_SemEval-2016_Task_6_Transfer_Learning_for_Stance_Detection","abstract":"We describe MITRE's submission to the SemEval-2016 Task 6, Detecting Stance in Tweets. This effort achieved the top score in Task A on supervised stance detection, producing an average F1 score of 67.8 when assessing whether a tweet author was in favor or against a topic. We employed a recurrent neural network initialized with features learned via distant supervision on two large unlabeled datasets. We trained embeddings of words and phrases with the word2vec skip-gram method, then used those features to learn sentence representations via a hashtag prediction auxiliary task. These sentence vectors were then fine-tuned for stance detection on several hundred labeled examples. The result was a high performing system that used transfer learning to maximize the value of the available training data.","authors":["Guido Zarrella","Amy Marsh"],"meta":["June 2016","DOI:10.18653/v1/S16-1074","Conference: Proceedings of the 10th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2016)"],"references":["305334597_SemEval-2016_Task_6_Detecting_Stance_in_Tweets","305334586_Learning_Distributed_Representations_of_Sentences_from_Unlabelled_Data","279068396_Skip-Thought_Vectors","268079628_How_transferable_are_features_in_deep_neural_networks","262276179_Stance_classification_using_dialogic_properties_of_persuasion","260439631_Identifying_Users_with_Opposing_Opinions_in_Twitter_Debates","257882504_Distributed_Representations_of_Words_and_Phrases_and_their_Compositionality","234131319_Efficient_Estimation_of_Word_Representations_in_Vector_Space","221102580_Support_or_Oppose_Classifying_Positions_in_Online_Debates_from_Reply_Activities_and_Opinion_Expressions","215470774_Recognizing_Stances_in_Online_Debates","13853244_Long_Short-term_Memory","319770439_Efficient_Estimation_of_Word_Representations_in_Vector_Space","301405013_TagSpace_Semantic_Embeddings_from_Hashtags","286794765_Dropout_A_Simple_Way_to_Prevent_Neural_Networks_from_Overfitting","283531914_Semi-supervised_Sequence_Learning","1959645_Get_out_the_vote_Determining_support_or_opposition_from_Congressionalfloor-debate_transcripts"]}
