In this paper, we presented a quantum algorithm (QKNN) for implementing this algorithm based on the metric of Hamming distance. We put forward a quantum circuit for computing Hamming distance between testing sample and each feature vector in the training set. Taking advantage of this method, we realized a good analog for classical KNN algorithm by setting a distance threshold value t to select k − nearest neighbors. As a result, QKNN achieves O(n³) performance which is only relevant to the dimension of feature vectors and high classification accuracy, outperforms Llyod’s algorithm (Lloyd et al. 2013) and Wiebe’s algorithm (Wiebe et al. 2014).","authors":["Yue Ruan","Xiling Xue","Heng Liu","Jianing Tan"],"meta":["November 2017International Journal of Theoretical Physics 56(4)","DOI:10.1007/s10773-017-3514-4"],"references":["312608584_One-class_SVMs_for_document_classification","283326408_Hamming_Distance_Metric_Learning","269417504_Quantum_Computing_for_Pattern_Classification","264742794_Quantum_algorithms_for_topological_and_geometric_analysis_of_big_data","306104651_A_speculative_approach_to_spatial-temporal_efficiency_with_multi-objective_optimization_in_a_heterogeneous_cloud_environment","305313210_A_Privacy-Preserving_and_Copy-Deterrence_Content-Based_Image_Retrieval_Scheme_in_Cloud_Computing","286490513_Enabling_Personalized_Search_over_Encrypted_Outsourced_Data_with_Efficiency_Improvement","276368901_A_Secure_and_Dynamic_Multi-Keyword_Ranked_Search_Scheme_over_Encrypted_Cloud_Data","273191656_Achieving_Efficient_Cloud_Search_Services_Multi-Keyword_Ranked_Search_over_Encrypted_Cloud_Data_Supporting_Parallel_Computing","267689755_Distributed_GraphLab_A_Framework_for_Machine_Learning_and_Data_Mining_in_the_Cloud"]}
