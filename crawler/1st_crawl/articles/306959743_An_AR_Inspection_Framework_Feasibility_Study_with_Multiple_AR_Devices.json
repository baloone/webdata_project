{"id":"306959743_An_AR_Inspection_Framework_Feasibility_Study_with_Multiple_AR_Devices","abstract":"We present an Augmented Reality (AR) based re-configurable framework for inspection that can be utilized in cross-domain applications such as maintenance and repair assistance in industrial inspection, health sector to record vitals, and automotive/avionics domain inspection , amongst others. The novelty of the inspection framework as compared to the existing counterparts are three fold. Firstly, the inspection checklist can be prioritized by detecting the parts viewed in inspector's field using deep learning principles. Second, the back-end of the framework is easily configurable for different applications where instructions and assistance manuals can be directly imported and visually integrated with inspection type. Third, we conduct a feasibility study on inspection modes such as Google Glass, Google Cardboard, Paper based and Tablet for inspection turnaround time, ease, and usefulness by taking a 3D printer inspection use-case.","authors":["Ramakrishna Perla","Ramya Hebbalaguppe","Gaurav Gupta","Geetika Sharma"],"meta":["August 2016","DOI:10.1109/ISMAR-Adjunct.2016.0080","Conference: IEEE ISMAR","Project: Augmented Reality, Deep learning and Computer Vision"],"references":["279867852_A_Survey_of_Augmented_Reality_Technologies_Applications_and_Limitations","276855764_Comparative_Study_of_Augmented_Reality_Sdk's","263928575_A_Unified_Framework_for_Augmented_Reality_and_Knowledge-based_Systems_in_Maintaining_Aircraft","261077137_How_interaction_methods_affect_image_segmentation_User_experience_in_the_task","319769911_Faster_R-CNN_Towards_Real-Time_Object_Detection_with_Region_Proposal_Networks","277722488_Faster_R-CNN_Towards_Real-Time_Object_Detection_with_Region_Proposal_Networks","276354075_Defining_Semantic_Relationships_to_Capitalize_Content_of_Multimedia_Resources","268004757_Plotting_Likert_and_Other_Rating_Scales","264556029_An_Augmented_Reality_Framework_for_Supporting_and_Monitoring_Operators_during_Maintenance_Tasks","224226524_A_No-Reference_Image_Blur_Metric_Based_on_the_Cumulative_Probability_of_Blur_Detection_CPBD"]}
