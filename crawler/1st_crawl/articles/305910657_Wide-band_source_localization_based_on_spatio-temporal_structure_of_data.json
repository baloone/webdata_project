{"id":"305910657_Wide-band_source_localization_based_on_spatio-temporal_structure_of_data","abstract":"In this paper, a new subspace method based on spatio-temporal structure of data is presented for estimation of directions-of-arrival (DOAs) of sources impinging on an array of sensors. Firstly, the signals received on the different sensors are processed independently sensor by sensor to estimate the Times Of Arrival (TOAs) of multipaths. Then, the obtained TOAs are post-processed to estimate the DOA of each ray path. Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed method is similar to those of HR methods, with an advantage in its ability to cope with the situation where the number of multipaths is much larger than that of antenna sensors, which arises in many practical situations.","authors":["Caroline Fossati","Salah Bourennane","Guilhem Villemin"],"meta":["August 2015","DOI:10.1109/EUSIPCO.2015.7362609","Conference: 2015 23rd European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)"],"references":["257749637_Efficient_time_of_arrival_estimation_in_the_presence_of_multipath_propagation","257054192_Spatio-temporal-based_joint_range_and_angle_estimation_for_wideband_signals","224605573_DOA_Estimation_of_Quasi-Stationary_Signals_With_Less_Sensors_Than_Sources_and_Unknown_Spatial_Noise_Covariance_A_Khatri-Rao_Subspace_Approach","224255652_Raypath_Separation_with_High_Resolution_Processing","220057373_About_Noneigenvector_Source_Localization_Methods","51622505_Travel-time_tomography_in_shallow_water_Experimental_demonstration_at_an_ultrasonic_scale","23997373_The_structure_of_raylike_arrivals_in_a_shallow-water_waveguide","5324281_Ocean_acoustic_tomography_using_a_double-beamforming_algorithm","4364004_Fast_Subspace-Based_Source_Localization_Methods","3319689_TOPS_new_DOA_estimator_for_wideband_signals","3177612_Spatio-Temporal_Spectral_Analysis_by_Eigenstructure_Methods","295468511_TECHNOLOGY_IN_OCEAN_ACOUSTIC_TOMOGRAPHY","271519304_Unified_analysis_of_DOA_estimation_algorithms_for_covariance_matrix_transforms","258656441_Denoising_of_Hyperspectral_Images_Using_the_PARAFAC_Model_and_Statistical_Performance_Analysis","224097262_Fast_Coherent_Signal_Subspace-Based_Method_for_Bearing_and_Range_of_Buried_Objects_Estimation_in_the_Presence_of_Colored_Noise","223615059_Robust_auto-focusing_wideband_DOA_estimation","222894750_Unified_analysis_for_DOA_estimation_algorithms_in_array_signal_processing","220228109_An_extended_TOPS_algorithm_based_on_incoherent_signal_subspace_method","3315611_Wideband_array_processing_using_a_two-sided_correlation_transformation","3177832_Coherent_signal-subspace_processing_for_the_detection_and_estimation_of_Angles_of_arrival_of_multiple_wide-band_sources","3175330_Focusing_matrices_for_coherent_signal-subspace_processing","3016535_Multiple_Emitter_Location_and_Signal_Parameter_Estimation"]}
