{"id":"323754758_Fatigue_life_prediction_of_mechanical_structures_under_stochastic_loading","abstract":"Problems of fatigue life prediction of materials and structures are discussed in the paper. Service loading is assumed as a continuous loading process with possible discontinuous events, which are caused by various operating conditions. The damage in a material is due to a cumulative degradation process. The damaging process is then represented either by rain-flow matrices or by a fatigue damage function which is derived using some hypothesis of a fatigue failure criterion. Presented theoretical procedure enables a very effective estimation of a service life and/or reliable evaluation of residual life of any structures under various types of loading and environmental conditions. This approach creates a good basis for powerful expert systems in structural and mechanical engineering. The aim of the paper is to present briefly some results of analysis of load-bearing steel structure loads of special railway crane PKP 25/20i which was utilized in some specific ad relatively hard operating conditions. Virtual models of the structure were being used in an analysis of acting working dynamics loads influence to be able to forecast fatigue life of load-bearing of the crane jib.","authors":["Bohu≈° Leitner","Lucia Figuli"],"meta":["January 2018MATEC Web of Conferences 157(4):02024","DOI:10.1051/matecconf/201815702024"],"references":["312015782_Research_of_weld_joint_fatigue_life_of_the_AlMgSi07F25_aluminium_alloy_under_bending-torsion_cyclic_loading","293132246_Computational_fatigue_damage_prediction_of_the_lorry_frames_under_random_excitation","293043975_Fatigue_Resistance_of_Reinforcing_Steel_Bars","275540777_Chosen_Numerical_Algorithms_for_Interval_Finite_Element_Analysis","317944539_Fatigue_life_estimation_of_screws_under_multiaxial_loading_using_a_local_approach","309148605_Fatigue_remaining_life_estimation_for_remanufacturing_truck_crane_Jib_structure_based_on_random_load_spectrum","304942766_Use_of_multibody_system_dynamics_as_a_tool_for_rail_vehicle_behaviour_diagnostics","290605485_Analysing_and_modelling_off-road_vehicle_availability","241077876_Railway_wheel_and_rail_head_profiles_development_based_on_the_geometric_characteristics_shapes"]}
