{"id":"288480471_A_Biogeography-Based_Optimization_Algorithm_Hybridized_with_Tabu_Search_for_the_Quadratic_Assignment_Problem","abstract":"The quadratic assignment problem (QAP) is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem with a wide variety of applications. Biogeography-based optimization (BBO), a relatively new optimization technique based on the biogeography concept, uses the idea of migration strategy of species to derive algorithm for solving optimization problems. It has been shown that BBO provides performance on a par with other optimization methods. A classical BBO algorithm employs the mutation operator as its diversification strategy. However, this process will often ruin the quality of solutions in QAP. In this paper, we propose a hybrid technique to overcome the weakness of classical BBO algorithm to solve QAP, by replacing the mutation operator with a tabu search procedure. Our experiments using the benchmark instances from QAPLIB show that the proposed hybrid method is able to find good solutions for them within reasonable computational times. Out of 61 benchmark instances tested, the proposed method is able to obtain the best known solutions for 57 of them.","authors":["Wee Loon Lim","Antoni Wibowo","Mohammad ISHAK Desa","Habibollah Haron"],"meta":["December 2015Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience 2016(2):1-12","DOI:10.1155/2016/5803893"],"references":["262879155_A_New_Recombination_Operator_for_the_Genetic_Algorithm_Solution_of_the_Quadratic_Assignment_Problem","320182358_The_Origin_of_Species","288653475_The_Theory_of_Island_Biogeography","286595038_Hybrid_metaheuristics_for_solving_the_quadratic_assignment_problem_and_the_generalized_quadratic_assignment_problem","284382099_P-complete_approximation_problem","273182423_On_the_performance_of_parallel_hybrid_algorithms_for_the_solution_of_the_quadratic_assignment_problem","271765554_Expansion_of_the_minimum-inbreeding_seed_orchard_design_to_operational_scale","271765483_Expansion_of_the_minimum-inbreeding_seed_orchard_design_to_operational_scale","263371936_A_robust_Island_Parallel_Genetic_Algorithm_for_the_Quadratic_Assignment_Problem","263371894_A_robust_Island_Parallel_Genetic_Algorithm_for_the_Quadratic_Assignment_Problem"]}
