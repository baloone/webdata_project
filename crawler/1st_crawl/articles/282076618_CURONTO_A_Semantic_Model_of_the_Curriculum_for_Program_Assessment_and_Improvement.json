{"id":"282076618_CURONTO_A_Semantic_Model_of_the_Curriculum_for_Program_Assessment_and_Improvement","abstract":"he Continuous Improvement Process (CIP) of an academic program in higher education is a tedious and time consuming task. Updating any part in the curriculum requires a thorough review of all the related and subsequent courses. Since 2008 the B.Sc. program of Information Technology (BSIT) in King Saud University (KSU), has initiated a CIP based on outcomes of both course and program levels in response to ABET accreditation requirements. To ensure the program delivers its educational objectives and student outcomes through a well-designed curriculum, we propose, in this paper, a semantic representation to model a complete curriculum using OWL ontology. Using such representation permits a global view of the internal relations and dependencies within elements of a curriculum and hence enables the CIP to be carried out easily. - See more at: http://fac.ksu.edu.sa/aalfaries/publication/93119#sthash.0GVujSLP.dpuf","authors":["Auhood Abdullah Alfaries"],"meta":["January 2014International Journal of Engineering Education 30(5):1083-1094"],"references":[]}
