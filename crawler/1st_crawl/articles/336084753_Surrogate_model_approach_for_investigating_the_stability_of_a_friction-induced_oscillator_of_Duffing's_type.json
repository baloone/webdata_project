{"id":"336084753_Surrogate_model_approach_for_investigating_the_stability_of_a_friction-induced_oscillator_of_Duffing's_type","abstract":"Parametric studies are required to detect instability regimes of dynamic systems. This prediction can be computationally demanding as it requires a fine exploration of large parametric space due to the disrupted mechanical behavior. In this paper, an efficient surrogate strategy is proposed to investigate the behavior of an oscillator of Duffing’s type in combination with an elasto-plastic friction force model. Relevant quantities of interest are discussed. Sticking time is considered using a machine learning technique based on Gaussian processes called kriging. The largest Lyapunov exponent is considered as an efficient indicator of chaotic motion. This indicator is estimated using a perturbation method. A dedicated adaptive kriging strategy for classification called MiVor is utilized and appears to be highly proficient in order to detect instabilities over the parametric space and can furthermore be used for complex response surfaces in multi-dimensional parametric domains.","authors":["Jan Niklas Fuhg","Amélie Fau"],"meta":["November 2019Nonlinear Dynamics 98(5)","DOI:10.1007/s11071-019-05281-2","Project: Adaptive metamodeling for parametric studies"],"references":["333187220_Adaptive_surrogate_modeling_for_parametric_studies_with_Kriging","323593300_Quantifying_Chaos_by_Various_Computational_Methods_Part_1_Simple_Systems","322889817_Spectrum_of_Lyapunov_exponents_in_non-smooth_systems_evaluated_using_orthogonal_perturbation_vectors","319035484_Gradient-enhanced_kriging_for_high-dimensional_problems","318380861_An_adaptive_sampling_strategy_for_Kriging_metamodel_based_on_Delaunay_triangulation_and_TOPSIS","328068532_Numerical_analysis_of_the_friction-induced_oscillator_of_Duffing's_type_with_modified_LuGre_friction_model","320208115_Investigation_of_Stick-Slip_Vibration_in_a_Commercial_Vehicle_Brake_Assembly","317304972_An_Adaptive_Sampling_Approach_for_Kriging_Metamodeling_by_Maximizing_Expected_Prediction_Error","313436696_Universal_approximation_using_radial_basis_function_networks","313429733_Sequential_adaptive_designs_in_computer_experiments_for_response_surface_model_fit","306004041_A_survey_and_comparison_of_several_friction_force_models_for_dynamic_analysis_of_multibody_mechanical_systems","312988054_A_multiplicative_ergodic_theorem_Characteristic_Ljapunov_exponents_of_dynamical_systems","312917692_Universal_approximation_using_radial_basis_function_networks","309761700_Comparisons_of_draft_gear_damping_mechanisms","308275999_Analytical_Approximations_for_Stick-Slip_Amplitudes_and_Frequency_of_Duffing_Oscillator"]}
