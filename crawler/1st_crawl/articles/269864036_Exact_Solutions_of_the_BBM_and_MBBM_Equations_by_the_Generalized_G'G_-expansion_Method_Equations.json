The generalized (G'/G )-expansion method was used to construct solitary wave and periodic wave solutions of nonlinear evolution equations. This method is developed for searching exact travelling wave solutions of nonlinear partial differential equations. It is shown that the (G'/G )-expansion method is straightforward and powerful mathematical tool for solving nonlinear problems.","authors":["J.
