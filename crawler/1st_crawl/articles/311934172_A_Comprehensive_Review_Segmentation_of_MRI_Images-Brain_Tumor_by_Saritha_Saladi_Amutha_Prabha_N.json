{"id":"311934172_A_Comprehensive_Review_Segmentation_of_MRI_Images-Brain_Tumor_by_Saritha_Saladi_Amutha_Prabha_N","abstract":"egmentation of tumors in human brain aims to classify\ndifferent abnormal tissues (necrotic core, edema, active cells) from\nnormal tissues (cerebrospinal fluid, gray matter, white matter) of the\nbrain. In existence, detection of abnormal tissues is easy for studying\nbrain tumor, but reproducibility, characterization of abnormalities and\naccuracy are complicated in the process of segmentation. The magnetic\nresonance imaging (MRI)-based segmentation of tumors in\nbrain images is more enhancing and attracting in current years of\nresearch studies. It is due to non-invasive examination and good\ncontrast prone to soft tissues of images obtained from MRI modality.\nMedical approval of different segmentation techniques depends on\nthe benchmark and simplicity of the method. This article incorporates\nboth fully-automatic and semi-automatic methods for segmentation.\nThe outlook study of this article is to provide the summary of\nmost significant segmentation methods of tumors in brain using\nMRI.","authors":["Saritha Saladi"],"meta":["December 2016International Journal of Imaging Systems and Technology 26(4)","DOI:10.1002/ima.22201","Project: segmentation of brain"],"references":["324987531_Implementation_of_Brain_Tumor_Segmentation_in_brain_MR_Images_using_K-Means_Clustering_and_Fuzzy_C-Means_Algorithm","307515757_Brain_image_segmentation_using_a_combination_of_expectation-maximization_algorithm_and_watershed_transform","304026595_Fuzzy_C_means_integrated_with_spatial_information_and_contrast_enhancement_for_segmentation_of_MR_brain_images","270455627_Discriminative_Clustering_and_Feature_Selection_for_Brain_MRI_Segmentation","306244260_Earlier_detection_of_cancer_regions_from_MR_image_features_and_SVM_classifiers","304026766_Brain_tumor_detection_and_diagnosis_using_ANFIS_classifier","297048334_Brain_tumor_segmentation_in_MRI_images_using_integrated_modified_PSO-fuzzy_approach","281504584_Image_segmentation_algorithm_using_watershed_transform_and_level_set_method","274901301_Alpha_Shape_Theory_for_3D_Visualization_and_Volumetric_Measurement_of_Brain_Tumor_Progression_Using_Magnetic_Resonance_Images","269417781_Multi-Atlas_Segmentation_of_Biomedical_Images_A_Survey"]}
