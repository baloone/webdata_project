{"id":"318076121_An_Analysis_of_Some_Aspects_of_Component-Based_Programming_for_Selecting_Appropriate_Categorical_Structures_as_their_Models","abstract":"Formal methods and formal models are important tools in software engineering. Formal methods provide unambiguous meaning of\nprograms written in some language or constructed from modules. Moreover, they provide the basic mathematical techniques necessary\nfor those who are working with theoretical background in computer science. Categories are interesting mathematical structures which\nhave become important for constructing the models of programs and program systems. In this paper we formulate an introductory\nanalysis of some aspects of component-based programming for selecting appropriate categorical structures as their models.","authors":["William Steingartner","Davorka Radakovic","Valerie Novitzk√°","Mohamed Ali M.
