{"id":"285661290_New_algorithm_of_backward_cloud","abstract":"Cloud model is an effective tool in uncertain transforming between qualitative concepts and their quantitative expressions. Backward cloud generator can transform quantitative values into qualitative concepts. In this paper, a new algorithm of backward cloud is given, which is more simple and precise than the old one. Then we have error analysis and comparison between the two algorithms. At last an application is given, which demonstrates the effective and correctness of the new algorithm.","authors":["C.-Y.
