{"id":"308837265_An_empirical_approach_to_validate_the_Dyslexia_Adaptive_E-Learning_DAEL_framework","abstract":"E-learning involves the use of electronic technology to enhance student's learning experiences. While e-learning can improve the efficiency with which information is shared with students, the quality of the learning material is not guaranteed. As such, there is a requirement for a comprehensive evaluation of the quality of the learning experiences provided by e-learning systems. The work described in this paper aimed to validate the Dyslexia Adaptive E-Learning (DAEL) framework as an effective tool for meeting the needs of students with dyslexia. A quality assessment approach was employed to examine the extent to which DAEL can meet the minimum standards and deliver improvements in the quality of the learning experiences that are delivered to dyslexic students via e-learning technologies. The validation results outlined in this study are reported according to data collected from an original survey that involved 149 dyslexic individuals and field experts who have experience with web-based learning management systems. The results were compared with existing literature to identify trends and validate the conclusions. It is anticipated that the empirically validated framework that emerged from this study will be of benefit to researchers who are involved in the development of adaptive e-learning systems for students with disabilities.","authors":["Aisha Alsobhi","Nawaz Khan","Harjinder Rahanu"],"meta":["July 2015","DOI:10.1109/ICCSE.2015.7250252","Conference: 2015 10th International Conference on Computer Science & Education (ICCSE)"],"references":["313086185_The_voice_of_the_customer","277919520_DAEL_Framework_A_New_Adaptive_E-learning_Framework_for_Students_with_Dyslexia","265086559_Objectifyng_content_validity_Conducting_a_content_validity_study_in_social_work_research","220933592_A_Web_design_framework_for_improved_accessibility_for_people_with_disabilities_WDFAD","215507339_Reliability_Validity_of_the_Adult_Learning_Inventory_among_Medical_Students","300257845_Creating_a_Confirmatory_Factor_Analysis_Model","267209653_Toward_Linking_Dyslexia_Types_and_Symptoms_to_the_Available_Assistive_Technologies","249359390_Approaches_to_the_validation_of_quality_frameworks_for_e-learning","241278381_Confirmatory_Factor_Analysis","225519393_An_approach_to_usability_evaluation_of_e-learning_applications","5175997_The_Voice_of_the_Customer","48408155_The_Learning_Approach_Inventory_LA-i_Its_reliability_and_validity_among_medical_students","44824358_Delivering_Digitally_Managing_the_Transition_to_the_Knowledge_Media"]}
