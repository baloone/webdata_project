{"id":"301881050_Decomposing_graphs_into_a_constant_number_of_locally_irregular_subgraphs","abstract":"A graph is locally irregular if no two adjacent vertices have the same degree. The irregular chromatic index $\\chi_{\\rm irr}'(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the smallest number of locally irregular subgraphs needed to edge-decompose $G$. Not all graphs have such a decomposition, but Baudon, Bensmail, Przyby{\\l}o, and Wo\\'zniak conjectured that if $G$ can be decomposed into locally irregular subgraphs, then $\\chi_{\\rm irr}'(G)\\leq 3$. In support of this conjecture, Przyby{\\l}o showed that $\\chi_{\\rm irr}'(G)\\leq 3$ holds whenever $G$ has minimum degree at least $10^{10}$. Here we prove that every bipartite graph $G$ which is not an odd length path satisfies $\\chi_{\\rm irr}'(G)\\leq 10$. This is the first general constant upper bound on the irregular chromatic index of bipartite graphs. Combining this result with Przyby{\\l}o's result, we show that $\\chi_{\\rm irr}'(G) \\leq 328$ for every graph $G$ which admits a decomposition into locally irregular subgraphs. Finally, we show that $\\chi_{\\rm irr}'(G)\\leq 2$ for every $16$-edge-connected bipartite graph $G$.","authors":["Julien Bensmail","Martin Merker","Carsten Thomassen"],"meta":["April 2016European Journal of Combinatorics 60(3)","DOI:10.1016/j.ejc.2016.09.011"],"references":["272199959_On_the_complexity_of_determining_the_irregular_chromatic_index_of_a_graph","233730705_The_1-2-3_Conjecture_and_related_problems_a_survey","220075635_Vertex-coloring_edge-weightings_Towards_the_1-2-3-conjecture","306320411_Edge-partitioning_graphs_into_regular_and_locally_irregular_components","305821210_The_3-flow_conjecture_factors_modulo_k_and_the_1-2-3-conjecture","280773319_On_Decomposing_Graphs_of_Large_Minimum_Degree_into_Locally_Irregular_Subgraphs","278828739_Edge-partitioning_graphs_into_regular_and_locally_irregular_components","275059329_On_decomposing_regular_graphs_into_locally_irregular_subgraphs","259994274_Graph_factors_modulo_k","259096420_Nowhere-zero_3-flows_and_modulo_k-orientations","251506498_The_weak_3-flow_conjecture_and_the_weak_circular_flow_conjecture","242793334_Edge_weights_and_vertex_colors"]}
