{"id":"311757339_TUT_database_for_acoustic_scene_classification_and_sound_event_detection","abstract":"We introduce TUT Acoustic Scenes 2016 database for environmental sound research, consisting of binaural recordings from 15 different acoustic environments. A subset of this database, called TUT Sound Events 2016, contains annotations for individual sound events, specifically created for sound event detection. TUT Sound Events 2016 consists of residential area and home environments, and is manually annotated to mark onset, offset and label of sound events. In this paper we present the recording and annotation procedure, the database content, a recommended cross-validation setup and performance of supervised acoustic scene classification system and event detection baseline system using mel frequency cepstral coefficients and Gaussian mixture models. The database is publicly released to provide support for algorithm development and common ground for comparison of different techniques.","authors":["Annamaria Mesaros","Toni Heittola","Tuomas Virtanen"],"meta":["August 2016","DOI:10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760424","Conference: 2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)"],"references":["303531094_Metrics_for_Polyphonic_Sound_Event_Detection","276508708_Detection_and_Classification_of_Acoustic_Scenes_and_Events","261484960_Detection_and_classification_of_acoustic_scenes_and_events_An_IEEE_AASP_challenge","261397816_Two-step_detection_of_water_sound_events_for_the_diagnostic_and_monitoring_of_dementia","235610949_Context-dependent_sound_event_detection","232622448_Events_Detection_for_an_Audio-Based_Surveillance_System","224009858_Acoustic_Monitoring_and_Localization_for_Social_Care","221485631_Detecting_Audio_Events_for_Semantic_Video_Search","221265922_Automatic_surveillance_of_the_acoustic_activity_in_our_living_environment","220520176_Apples-to-Apples_in_Cross-Validation_Studies_Pitfalls_in_Classifier_Performance_Measurement_ABSTRACT","26620182_A_Discriminative_Model_for_Polyphonic_Piano_Transcription","3457582_A_flexible_framework_for_key_audio_effects_detection_and_auditory_context_inference","313544906_Audio-based_context_recognition","308734430_Acoustic_context_recognition_using_local_binary_pattern_codebooks","308734312_Acoustic_event_detection_for_multiple_overlapping_similar_sources","305910814_HOG_and_subband_power_distribution_image_features_for_acoustic_scene_classification","279952471_Reliable_Detection_of_Audio_Events_in_Highly_Noisy_Environments","278408630_Histogram_of_Gradients_of_Time-Frequency_Representations_for_Audio_Scene_Classification","221265130_Healthcare_audio_event_classification_using_Hidden_Markov_Models_and_Hierarchical_Hidden_Markov_Models","220723660_Towards_Quantifying_the_Album_Effect_in_Artist_Identification","220214377_Audio_keywords_generation_for_sports_video_analysis","3457520_Audio-based_context_recognition"]}
