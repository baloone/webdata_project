{"id":"313402945_Simple_quad_domains_for_field_aligned_mesh_parametrization","abstract":"We present a method for the global parametrization of meshes that preserves alignment to a cross field in input while obtaining a parametric domain made of few coarse axis-aligned rectangular patches, which form an abstract base complex without T-junctions. The method is based on the topological simplification of the cross field in input, followed by global smoothing.","authors":["M. Tarini","Enrico Puppo","D.
