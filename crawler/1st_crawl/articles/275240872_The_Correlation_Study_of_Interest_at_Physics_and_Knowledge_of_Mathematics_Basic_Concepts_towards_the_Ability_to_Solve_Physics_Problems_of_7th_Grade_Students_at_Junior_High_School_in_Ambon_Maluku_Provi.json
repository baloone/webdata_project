The populations are all students in the 7th grade at the junior high school in Ambon, Maluku, Indonesia. The used sample schools are Junior High Schools 8, 9, and 10 during 2013/2014 academic year with 44 students per school. Two independent variables and one dependent variable are studied. The independent variables are the interest at Physics (X1) and the knowledge of Mathematics basic concepts (X2), while the dependent variable is the ability to solve Physics problems (Y). Data collection technique for X1 is an interview with questionnaire instrument, while for the X2 and Y is using the test technique with test items instrument. The obtained data from the measurements were analyzed with descriptive analysis and inferential analysis. The results show that there is a positive relation between interest at Physics and knowledge of Mathematics basic concepts with studentsâ€™ ability to solve Physics problems.","authors":["Izaak Hendrik Wenno"],"meta":["April 2015Education Research International 2015(2):1-6","DOI:10.1155/2015/396750"],"references":["281224056_A_Cross-Subject_Investigation_of_College_Students'_Epistemological_Beliefs_of_Physics_and_Mathematics","279510738_DETERMINING_THE_EFFECT_OF_PROBLEM-BASED_LEARNING_INSTRUCTIONAL_STRATEGY_ON_NCE_PRE-SERVICE_TEACHERS'_ACHIEVEMENT_IN_PHYSICS_AND_ACQUISITION_OF_SCIENCE_PROCESS_SKILLS","273742501_Problems_Challenging_the_Academic_Performance_of_Physics_Students_in_Higher_Governmental_Institutions_in_the_Case_of_Arbaminch_Wolayita_Sodo_Hawassa_and_Dilla_Universities","272457287_Determining_the_Effect_of_Interactive_Invention_Instructional_Strategy_and_Gender_on_NCE_Pre-Service_Teachers'_Acquisition_of_Science_Process_Skills","271105324_Analysis_of_Teachers_Perception_of_Their_Public_Image_and_It_Influence_on_Students_Performance_in_Physics_A_Key_to_Improving_the_Quality_of_Education_in_Nigeria","264224326_Understanding_Student_Differences","246849224_Modeling_as_a_teaching-learning_strategy","228967331_An_exploration_of_internal_factors_influencing_student_learning_of_programming","255579430_The_relationship_between_mathematics_preparation_and_conceptual_learning_gains_in_physics_A_possible_hidden_variable_in_diagnostic_pretest_scores","241214257_High_school_students'_perceptions_of_physics"]}
