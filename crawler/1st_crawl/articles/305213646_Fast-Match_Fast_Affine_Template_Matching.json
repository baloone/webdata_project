{"id":"305213646_Fast-Match_Fast_Affine_Template_Matching","abstract":"Fast-Match is a fast algorithm for approximate template matching under 2D affine transformations that minimizes the Sum-of-Absolute-Differences (SAD) error measure. There is a huge number of transformations to consider but we prove that they can be sampled using a density that depends on the smoothness of the image. For each potential transformation, we approximate the SAD error using a sublinear algorithm that randomly examines only a small number of pixels. We further accelerate the algorithm using a branch-and-bound-like scheme. As images are known to be piecewise smooth, the result is a practical affine template matching algorithm with approximation guarantees, that takes a few seconds to run on a standard machine. We perform several experiments on three different datasets, and report very good results.","authors":["Simon Korman","Daniel Reichman","Gilad Tsur","Shai Avidan"],"meta":["January 2017International Journal of Computer Vision 121(1)","DOI:10.1007/s11263-016-0926-1"],"references":["243763787_Motion_displacement_estimation_using_an_affine_model_for_image_matching","221498619_Testing_Properties_of_Sparse_Images","221411551_Grayscale_Template-Matching_Invariant_to_Rotation_Scale_Translation_Brightness_and_Contrast","308642582_ASIFT_A_new_framework_for_fully_affine_invariant_image_comparison","268885968_Multiple_view_geometry_in_computer_vision_With_foreword_by_Olivier_Faugeras_2nd_edition","266378625_Scalable_Nearest_Neighbor_Algorithms_for_High_Dimensional_Data","257672345_Globally_Optimal_Estimation_of_Nonrigid_Image_Distortion","239062109_ZuBuD_Zurich_Buildings_Database_for_Image_Based_Recognition","222675705_Retrieval_of_translated_rotated_and_scaled_color_textures","222556779_Rotation-invariant_pattern_matching_using_wavelet_decomposition","220660049_A_Comparison_of_Affine_Region_Detectors","221361616_Real-Time_Image_Matching_Based_on_Multiple_View_Kernel_Projection","221110508_Filter_Flow","220744960_Accelerating_Pattern_Matching_or_How_Much_Can_You_Slide","220692721_Multiple_view_geometry_in_computer_vision_2_ed"]}
