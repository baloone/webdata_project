{"id":"284806252_Optimal_fixed-levels_control_for_nonlinear_systems_with_quadratic_cost-functionals","abstract":"This paper is devoted Q1 to general optimal control problems (OCPs) associated with a family of nonlin-ear continuous-time switched systems in the presence of some specific control constraints. The stepwise (fixed-level type) control restrictions we consider constitute a common class of admissible controls in many real-world engineering systems. Moreover, these control restrictions can also be interpreted as a result of a quantization procedure appglied to the inputs of a conventional dynamic system. We study control systems with a priori given time-driven switching mechanism in the presence of a quadratic cost functional. Our aim is to develop a practically implementable control algorithm that makes it possible to calculate approximating solutions for the class of OCPs under consideration. The paper presents a newly elaborated linear quadratic-type optimal control scheme and also contains illustrative numerical examples.","authors":["Vadim Azhmyakov","Javier Cabrera Martinez","Alexander Poznyak"],"meta":["January 2015Optimal Control Applications and Methods 37(5):n/a-n/a","DOI:10.1002/oca.2223"],"references":["268552203_Attractive_Ellipsoids_in_Robust_Control","266007497_Relaxation_in_Optimization_Theory_and_Variational_Calculus","260662187_A_Unified_Framework_for_Hybrid_Control_Model_and_Optimal_Control_Theory","260340975_On_Weak_and_Strong_Convergence_of_the_Projected_Gradient_Method_for_Convex_Optimization_in_Hilbert_Spaces","258407149_Finite_Set_Control_Transcription_for_Optimal_Control_Applications","256821709_Nonlinear_Programming","240824586_Full_convergence_of_the_steepest_descent_method_with_inexact_line_searches","227205432_Numerical_computation_of_neighboring_optimum_feedback_control_schemes_in_real-time","225690522_Approximations_of_Relaxed_Optimal_Control_Problems","224560828_Hybrid_LQ-Optimization_Using_Dynamic_Programming","348861295_Control_Theoretic_Splines_Optimal_Control_Statistics_and_Path_Planning","344242944_Nonsmooth_Analysis_and_Control_Theory","336055699_An_implicit_systems_characterization_of_a_class_of_impulsive_linear_switched_control_processes_Part_1_Modeling","323723586_Constrained_control_and_estimation_An_optimisation_approach","316471045_Advanced_Mathematical_Tools_for_Automatic_Control_Engineers_Volume_2","316322405_Advanced_Mathematical_Tools_for_Control_Engineers_Volume_1","284801520_Introduction_to_numerical_analysis_Third_edition","278689347_The_Robust_Maximum_Principle","275970953_An_Introduction_to_Numerical_Analysis","268721278_Control_theoretic_splines_Optimal_control_statistics_and_path_planning","268247156_Infinite-Dimensional_Optimization_and_Control_Theory","267479862_Optimal_Control_with_Aerospace_Applications","266312379_A_unified_computational_approach_to_optimal_control_problems","265461589_The_robust_maximum_principle_Theory_and_applications","264965934_Convex_functional_analysis","263233621_Supervisory_control_of_uncertain_systems_with_quantized_information","263047897_Convex_Analysis_and_Minimization_Algorithms_II","262193712_An_implicit_systems_characterization_of_a_class_of_impulsive_linear_switched_control_processes_Part_2_Control","261230578_Convex_relaxations_for_nonconvex_optimal_control_problems","260112174_Fuzzy_control_of_continuous-time_recurrent_fuzzy_systems","257605801_Convex_and_Concave_Relaxations_for_the_Parametric_Solutions_of_Semi-explicit_Index-One_Differential-Algebraic_Equations","256761316_Nondegenerate_Necessary_Conditions_for_Nonconvex_Optimal_Control_Problems_with_State_Constraints","254054677_Convex_relaxations_for_nonconvex_optimal_control_problems","251566096_Nonsmooth_Analysis_and_Control_Theory","246532363_Introduction_to_the_Theory_of_Nonlinear_Optimization","245916423_Differential_Equations_with_Discontinuous_Right-Hand_Side","245775540_Constrained_Control_and_Estimation-An_Optimisation_Approach","245371900_Practical_Methods_for_Optimal_Control_Using_Nonlinear_Programming","245321596_Structure_and_control_of_piecewise-linear_systems","243094716_What_is_the_Subdifferential_of_the_Closed_Convex_Hull_of_a_Function","243093565_Investigation_of_the_Degeneracy_Phenomenon_of_the_Maximum_Principle_for_Optimal_Control_Problems_with_State_Constraints","239745956_Robot_Motion_and_Control_2007","239023987_Optimization_Algorithms_and_Consistent_Approximations","235410150_Optimal_Control_Theory","230873007_Theory_of_Extremal_Problems","230802015_Convex_Programming_in_Hilbert_Space","228979431_Lecture_notes_on_hybrid_systems","225803781_Zero_duality_gap_for_a_class_of_nonconvex_optimization_problems","225746022_Lecture_Notes_in_Control_and_Information_Sciences","224579941_On-Line_Optimization_of_Switched-Mode_Dynamical_Systems","224162367_On_the_LQ-based_optimization_techniques_for_impulsive_hybrid_control_systems","224367702_Sliding_mode_regulator_as_solution_to_optimal_control_problem","224159004_Supervisory_Control_of_Uncertain_Linear_Time-Varying_Systems","222545092_Hybrid_Feedback_Stabilisation_of_Systems_with_Quantized_Signals","222146105_Optimal_control_of_impulsive_hybrid_systems"]}
