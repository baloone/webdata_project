Its essence is the allocation of monolithic (global) control action among individual (local) control strategies of component agents. In this paper, we extend supervisor localization to study distributed control of DES with infinite behavior, in order to address specifications of the ‘eventuality’ or ‘liveness’ type. Specifically, we first employ Thistle and Wonham's supervisory control theory for DES with infinite behavior to compute a safety supervisor (enforcing desired finite behavior) and a liveness supervisor (enforcing desired infinite behavior), and then design a suitable localization procedure to decompose the obtained supervisors respectively into local safety and liveness controllers. We prove that the derived local safety/liveness controllers collectively achieve the same controlled behavior as the monolithic supervisors do.","authors":["Renyuan Zhang","Kai Cai"],"meta":["January 2018IFAC-PapersOnLine 51(7):361-366","DOI:10.1016/j.ifacol.2018.06.326"],"references":[]}
