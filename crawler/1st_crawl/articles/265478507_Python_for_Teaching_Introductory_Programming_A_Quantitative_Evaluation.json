{"id":"265478507_Python_for_Teaching_Introductory_Programming_A_Quantitative_Evaluation","abstract":"This paper compares two different approaches of teaching introductory programming by quantitatively analysing the student assessments in a real classroom. The first approach is to emphasise the principles of object-oriented programming and design using Java from the very beginning. The second approach is to first teach the basic programming concepts (loops, branch, and use of libraries) using Python and then move on to oriented programming using Java. Each approach was adopted for one academic year (2008-09 and 2009-10) with first year undergraduate students. Quantitative analysis of the student assessments from the first semester of each year was then carried out. The results of this analysis are presented in this paper. These results suggest that the later approach leads to enhanced learning of introductory programming concepts by students.","authors":["Ambikesh Jayal","Stasha Lauria","Allan Tucker","Stephen Swift"],"meta":["February 2011ITALICS Innovations in Teaching and Learning in Information and Computer Sciences 10(1)","DOI:10.11120/ital.2011.10010086"],"references":["220613179_Failure_rates_in_introductory_programming","220613151_Research_perspectives_on_the_objects-early_debate","311476508_Fundamental_concepts_of_CS1_procedural_vs_object_oriented_paradigm_-_a_case_study","262175234_A_tale_of_two_paradigms","239927984_Introductory_Programming_with_Python","234783362_Teaching_programming_languages_A_survey_of_approaches","221209635_Empirical_comparison_of_objects-first_and_objects-later","220881427_Python_Programming_Language","220807647_Fundamental_concepts_of_CS1_procedural_vs_object_oriented_paradigm_-_a_case_study","220612681_Controversy_on_how_to_teach_CS_1_a_discussion_on_the_SIGCSE-members_mailing_list"]}
