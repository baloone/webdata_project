{"id":"340927644_Rescoring_ensembles_of_protein-protein_docking_poses_using_consensus_approaches","abstract":"Scoring is a challenging step in protein-protein docking, where typically thousands of solutions are generated. Successful scoring is more often based on physicochemical evaluation of the generated interfaces and/or statistical potentials that reproduce known interface properties. Another route is offered by consensus-based rescoring, where the set of solutions is used to build statistics in order to identify recurrent solutions. We explore several ways to perform consensus-based rescoring on the ZDOCK decoy set for Benchmark 4. We show that the information of the interface size is critical for successful rescoring. We combine consensus-based rescoring with the ZDOCK native scoring function and show that this improves the initial results.","authors":["Guillaume Launay","Masahito Ohue","Julia Prieto Santero","Yuri Matsuzaki"],"meta":["April 2020","DOI:10.1101/2020.04.24.059469"],"references":["320035200_LightDock_A_New_Multi-Scale_Approach_to_Protein-protein_Docking","280030137_Analysis_and_Ranking_of_Protein-Protein_Docking_Models_Using_Inter-Residue_Contacts_and_Inter-Molecular_Contact_Maps","275360247_DOCKSCORE_A_webserver_for_ranking_protein-protein_docked_poses","269999117_CONSRANK_A_server_for_the_analysis_comparison_and_ranking_of_docking_models_based_on_inter-residue_contacts","338237758_An_overview_of_data-driven_HADDOCK_strategies_in_CAPRI_rounds_38-45","310545351_Use_of_an_interface_contact_statistics_to_rescore_protein-protein_docked_ensembles","310472290_Modeling_protein-protein_and_protein-peptide_complexes_CAPRI_6_th_edition","309095777_Lessons_from_co-evolution_in_the_docking_of_proteins_and_peptides_for_CAPRI_rounds_28-35_Lessons_from_co-evolution","283076539_Accelerating_protein_docking_in_ZDOCK_using_an_advanced_3D_convolution_library","268788863_Protein-Protein_Docking_From_Interaction_to_Interactome"]}
