{"id":"303349483_Koszul_resolutions","abstract":"Resolutions, which generalize the classical Koszul resolutions, are constructed for a large class of augmented algebras including the Steenrod algebra and the universal enveloping algebras. For each such algebra A, an explicit differenÂ­tial algebra K*(A) is described such that (1) K*(A) is a small quotient algebra of the cobar complex and (2) the homology of K*(A) is the cohomology algebra H*(A). The resolution of May for restricted Lie algebras in characteristic 2 is retrieved and a simple derivation of the resolution of Kan et al. of the Steenrod algebra is given.","authors":["S.B.
