{"id":"314174280_The_Routledge_Handbook_of_Instructed_Second_Language_Acquisition","abstract":"This is an ambitious work, covering the whole breadth of the field from its theoretical underpinnings to research and teaching methodology. The Editors have managed to recruit a stellar panel of contributors, resulting in the kind of 'all you ever wanted to know about instructed SLA' collection that should be found on the shelves of every good library. \" Zoltán Dörnyei, University of Nottingham, UK The Routledge Handbook of Instructed Second Language Acquisition is the first collection of state-of-the-art papers pertaining to Instructed Second Language Acquisition (ISLA). Written by 45 world-renowned experts, the entries are full-length articles detailing pertinent issues with up-to-date references. Each chapter serves three purposes: (1) provide a review of current literature and discussions of cutting edge issues; (2) share the authors' understanding of, and approaches to, the issues; and (3) provide direct links between research and practice. In short, based on the chapters in this handbook, ISLA has attained a level of theoretical and methodological maturity that provides a solid foundation for future empirical and pedagogical discovery. This handbook is the ideal resource for researchers, graduate students, upper-level undergraduate students, teachers, and teacher-educators who are interested in second language learning and teaching.","authors":["Kathleen Bardovi-Harlig","Melissa Bowles","Yuko Butler","Ina Choi"],"meta":["February 2017","Edition: 1stPublisher: RoutledgeEditor: Shawn Loewen, Masatoshi SatoISBN: 1138936235","Projects: Instructed second language acquisitionLanguage Aptitude"],"references":[]}
