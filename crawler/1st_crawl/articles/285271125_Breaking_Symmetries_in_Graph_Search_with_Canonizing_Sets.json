{"id":"285271125_Breaking_Symmetries_in_Graph_Search_with_Canonizing_Sets","abstract":"There are many complex combinatorial problems which involve searching for an\nundirected graph satisfying given constraints. Such problems are often highly\nchallenging because of the large number of isomorphic representations of their\nsolutions. This paper introduces effective and compact, complete symmetry\nbreaking constraints for small graph search. Enumerating with these symmetry\nbreaks generates all and only non-isomorphic solutions. For small search\nproblems, with up to $10$ vertices, we compute instance independent symmetry\nbreaking constraints. For small search problems with a larger number of\nvertices we demonstrate the computation of instance dependent constraints which\nare complete. We illustrate the application of complete symmetry breaking\nconstraints to extend two known sequences from the OEIS related to graph\nnumeration.","authors":["Avraham Itzhakov","Michael Codish"],"meta":["July 2016Constraints 21(3)","DOI:10.1007/s10601-016-9244-z","SourcearXiv"],"references":["327227702_Constraints_for_symmetry_breaking_in_graph_representation","265655095_Small_Ramsey_Numbers","262329814_Breaking_symmetries_in_graph_representation","260039340_Boolean_Equi-propagation_for_Concise_and_Efficient_SAT_Encodings_of_Combinatorial_Problems","322893605_On_the_Glucose_SAT_solver","268007189_Constructive_Enumeration_of_Combinatorial_Objects","262202715_Fast_Generation_of_Cubic_Graphs","246923286_NAUTY_User''s_Guide_Version_15","243778190_Every_one_a_Winner_or_how_to_Avoid_Isomorphism_Search_when_Cataloguing_Combinatorial_Configurations","240917962_Breaking_Symmetry_with_Different_Orderings","230764359_Graph_Symmetry_Detection_and_Canonical_Labeling_Differences_and_Synergies","230764357_Conflict_Anticipation_in_the_Search_for_Graph","230397846_R4_5_25","228567733_Fast_generation_of_cubic_graphs","227727521_Highly_irregular_graphs"]}
