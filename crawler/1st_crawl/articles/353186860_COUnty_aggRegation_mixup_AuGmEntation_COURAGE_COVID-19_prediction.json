{"id":"353186860_COUnty_aggRegation_mixup_AuGmEntation_COURAGE_COVID-19_prediction","abstract":"The global spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has casted a significant threat to mankind. As the COVID-19 situation continues to evolve, predicting localized disease severity is crucial for advanced resource allocation. This paper proposes a method named COURAGE (COUnty aggRegation mixup AuGmEntation) to generate a short-term prediction of 2-week-ahead COVID-19 related deaths for each county in the United States, leveraging modern deep learning techniques. Specifically, our method adopts a self-attention model from Natural Language Processing, known as the transformer model, to capture both short-term and long-term dependencies within the time series while enjoying computational efficiency. Our model solely utilizes publicly available information for COVID-19 related confirmed cases, deaths, community mobility trends and demographic information, and can produce state-level predictions as an aggregation of the corresponding county-level predictions. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that our model achieves the state-of-the-art performance among the publicly available benchmark models.","authors":["Siawpeng Er","Shihao Yang","Tuo Zhao"],"meta":["July 2021Scientific Reports 11(1):14262","DOI:10.1038/s41598-021-93545-6"],"references":["350730996_Parameter_estimation_from_ICC_curves","349122095_Tracking_COVID-19_using_online_search","348752280_STAN_spatio-temporal_attention_network_for_pandemic_prediction_using_real-world_evidence","348285631_Risk_mapping_for_COVID-19_outbreaks_in_Australia_using_mobility_data","346627715_Time_dynamics_of_COVID-19","346204856_Using_an_Agent-Based_Model_to_Assess_K-12_School_Reopenings_Under_Different_COVID-19_Spread_Scenarios_-_United_States_School_Year_202021","353897757_Efficiency_of_communities_and_financial_markets_during_the_2020_pandemic","349556736_Trade-offs_between_mobility_restrictions_and_transmission_of_SARS-CoV-2","349233355_Curating_a_COVID-19_Data_Repository_and_Forecasting_County-Level_Death_Counts_in_the_United_States","347374975_Unraveling_US_National_COVID-19_RacialEthnic_Disparities_using_County_Level_Data_Among_328_Million_Americans","345966880_DeepCOVID_An_Operational_Deep_Learning-driven_Framework_for_Explainable_Real-time_COVID-19_Forecasting","345657852_Real-time_interactive_website_for_US-county-level_COVID-19_event_risk_assessment","344343942_Forecast_analysis_of_the_epidemics_trend_of_COVID-19_in_the_USA_by_a_generalized_fractional-order_SEIR_model","343820239_Ensemble_forecasts_of_Coronavirus_Disease_2019_COVID-19_in_the_US","345196276_A_Time-dependent_SIR_model_for_COVID-19_with_Undetectable_Infected_Persons"]}
