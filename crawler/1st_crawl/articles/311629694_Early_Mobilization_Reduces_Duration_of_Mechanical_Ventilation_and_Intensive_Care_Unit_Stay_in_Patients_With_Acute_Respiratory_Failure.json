{"id":"311629694_Early_Mobilization_Reduces_Duration_of_Mechanical_Ventilation_and_Intensive_Care_Unit_Stay_in_Patients_With_Acute_Respiratory_Failure","abstract":"Objectives: \nTo evaluate the effects of a quality improvement program to introduce early mobilization on the outcome of mechanical ventilation (MV) patients in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).\n\nDesign: \nA retrospective observational study SETTING: 19-beds ICU at a medical center PARTICIPANTS: All adults MV patients admitted a medical ICU INTERVENTION: A multidisciplinary team (critical care nurse, nursing assistant, respiratory therapist, physical therapist, and patients' family) initiated the protocol within 72 hours of MV, when patients become hemodynamically stable. We did early mobilization twice daily, 5 days per week during family visits (30 minutes each time), and cooperated with family if possible.\n\nMain outcome measurements: \nThe MV duration, the rate of successful weaning, and the length of ICU and hospital stay RESULTS: We enrolled 63 patients in the Before Protocol (BP) group and 90 in the After Protocol (AP) group. The two groups were well matched in age, gender, body height, body weight, body mass index, disease severity, cause of intubation, number of comorbidities, and most underlying diseases. AP group patients had shorter MV durations (4.7 vs. 7.5 days, p < 0.001) and ICU stays (6.9 vs. 9.9 days, p = 0.001) than did BP group patients. Early mobilization was negatively associated with the duration of MV (β = ‒0.269, p = < 0.002, 95% confidence interval (CI): ‒4.767 to ‒1.072), and the risk of MV for ≥ 7 days was lower in patients given early mobilization (odds ratio: 0.082, 95% CI: 0.021 to 0.311).\n\nConclusions: \nThe introduction of early mobilization for MV patients in the ICU shortened MV durations and ICU stays. A multidisciplinary team that includes the patient's family can work together to improve the patient's clinical outcomes.","authors":["Chih-Cheng Lai","Willy Chou","Khee-Siang Chan","Kuo-Chen Cheng"],"meta":["December 2016Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation 98(5)","DOI:10.1016/j.apmr.2016.11.007"],"references":["266397969_Enhancing_rehabilitation_of_mechanically_ventilated_patients_in_the_intensive_care_unit_A_quality_improvement_project","51863193_Effects_of_Exercise_Training_on_Pulmonary_Mechanics_and_Functional_Status_in_Patients_With_Prolonged_Mechanical_Ventilation","51029346_Functional_Disability_5_Years_after_Acute_Respiratory_Distress_Syndrome","43099282_Early_Physical_Medicine_and_Rehabilitation_for_Patients_With_Acute_Respiratory_Failure_A_Quality_Improvement_Project","38112808_Feasibility_and_impact_of_a_structured_exercise-based_rehabilitation_programme_for_intensive_care_survivors","26686617_Early_exercise_in_critically_ill_patients_enhances_short-term_functional_recovery","11000195_Paresis_Acquired_in_the_Intensive_Care_Unit_A_Prospective_Multicenter_Study","259516655_Safety_of_physical_therapy_interventions_in_critically_ill_patients_A_single_center_prospective_evaluation_of_1110_ICU_admissions","51441043_A_framework_for_diagnosing_and_classifying_intensive_care_unit-acquired_weakness","40035553_Rehabilitation_therapy_and_outcomes_in_acute_respiratory_failure_An_observational_pilot_project","24431258_Early_physical_and_occupational_therapy_in_mechanically_ventilated_critically_ill_patients_A_randomised_controlled_trial","8555790_Physiological_responses_to_the_early_mobilisation_of_the_intubated_ventilated_abdominal_surgery_patient","8183802_Two-Year_Cognitive_Emotional_and_Quality-of-Life_Outcomes_in_Acute_Respiratory_Distress_Syndrome","7729817_Neuromuscular_sequelae_of_critical_illness","6830078_Effects_of_Physical_Training_on_Functional_Status_in_Patients_With_Prolonged_Mechanical_Ventilation","6665809_Early_activity_is_feasible_and_safe_in_respiratory_failure_patients","6515591_Physical_and_psychological_sequelae_of_critical_illness","5255981_Early_intensive_care_unit_mobility_therapy_in_the_treatment_of_acute_respiratory_failure"]}
