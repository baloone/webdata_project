{"id":"286364557_Efficient_String_Sorting_on_Multi_-_and_Many-Core_Architectures","abstract":"This paper addresses the issue of efficient sorting of strings on multi-and many-core processors. We propose CPU and GPU implementations of the most-significant digit radix sort algorithm using different parallelization strategies on various stages of the execution to achieve good workload balance and optimal use of system resources. We evaluate the performance of our solution on both architectures and compare efficiency of the sorting algorithm on various key lengths. For the GPU implementation we introduce a communication-reducing strategy to overcome the limitations of the PCIe bus bandwidth. Both implementations achieve sorting rates up to 70 million keys per second sorting throughput with good scalability.","authors":["Aleksandr Drozd","Miquel Peric√†s","Satoshi Matsuoka"],"meta":["September 2014","DOI:10.1109/BigData.Congress.2014.97"],"references":["228359315_A_cache-efficient_sorting_algorithm_for_database_and_data_mining_computations_using_graphics_processors","221395578_Sorting_networks_and_their_applications","221214289_GPUTeraSort_High_Performance_Graphics_Coprocessor_Sorting_for_Large_Database_Management","4245470_GPU-ABiSort_optimal_parallel_sorting_on_stream_architectures","2565831_Cache-Conscious_Sorting_of_Large_Sets_of_Strings_with_Dynamic_Tries","313645165_Scan_primitives_for_GPU_computing","271456024_Can_GPUs_sort_strings_efficiently","271416717_GPUTeraSort","266654974_Register_level_sort_algorithm_on_multi-core_SIMD_processors","247442902_Introduction_To_Algorithms","243786453_Sorting_strings_with_three-way_radix_quicksort","228057690_Parallel_Merge-Sort","222516632_Fast_Parallel_GPU-sorting_using_a_Hybrid_Algorithm","221149568_Efficient_Massively_Parallel_Quicksort","220884714_Revisiting_Sorting_for_GPGPU_Stream_Architectures","220780302_Fast_Algorithms_for_Sorting_and_Searching_Strings","220639794_GPU-Quicksort_A_practical_Quicksort_algorithm_for_graphics_processors","220617852_Adaptive_Bitonic_Sorting_An_Optimal_Parallel_Algorithm_for_Shared-Memory_Machines","220423048_Algorithm_65_find","216457274_The_Art_Of_Computer_Programming_Vol3_Sorting_and_Searching","202260509_Scan_Primitives_for_GPU_Computing","202232988_Algorithm_64_Quicksort","200018929_Photon_Mapping_on_Programmable_Graphics_Hardware","3885108_Efficient_conditional_operations_for_data-parallel_architectures"]}
