{"id":"357397083_What_the_R_is_Creativity","abstract":"Creativity is The Holy Grail of the Cognitive Sciences and it is very important for researchers in the Computer Sciences and AI fields. Although all attempts to explain and replicate intelligence have so far failed, the quest remains a key part of their research. This paper takes two innovative approaches. First, we see cognitive processes as involving rule-followingand as flexible, even chaotic, heuristics. This first concept uses a multi-heuristic concept without any complexes as mixed-cognition. Second, we propose abduction which, though seldom employed in this specific debate, is nonetheless a good way to explore creativity. Using both strategies, along with analysis of specific human creativity cases, we suggesta new cognitive paradigm that is both more realistic and truthful than hitherto. The idea is to offer a new way to achieve more powerful, complex artificial reasoning systems.","authors":["Alger Sans Pinillos","Jordi Vallverdu"],"meta":["December 2021Debats Revista de cultura poder i societat Anual Review(6):135-147","DOI:10.28939/iam.debats-en.2021-9","Project: Foundations of Cognition"],"references":["332390874_Blended_Cognition_The_Robotic_Challenge","331616996_Coevolution_of_visual_behaviour_the_material_world_and_social_complexity_depicted_by_the_eye-tracking_of_archaeological_objects_in_humans","330729291_Rigor_Mortis_Que_passa_quan_una_teoria_nega_allo_que_no_li_pertany_o_que_passa_quan_un_coneixement_es_veu_obligat_a_adaptar-se_al_que_no_pot_Comentari_critic_de_Construir_en_la_foscor_Teoria_i_observa","329600914_The_Urgent_Need_of_a_Naturalized_Logic","322250619_El_lado_epistemologico_de_las_abducciones_La_creatividad_en_las_verdades-proyectadas","338908024_Observation_and_Explanation_A_Guide_to_Philosophy_of_Science","329954110_Computational_Philosophy_of_Science","327229092_Algorithmic_Cognition_and_the_Computational_Nature_of_the_Mind_A_Volume_in_the_Encyclopedia_of_Complexity_and_Systems_Science_Second_Edition","324937048_The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions","319655040_Brains_language_and_the_argumentative_mind_in_Western_and_Eastern_societies_The_fertile_differences_between_Western-Eastern_argumentative_traditions"]}
