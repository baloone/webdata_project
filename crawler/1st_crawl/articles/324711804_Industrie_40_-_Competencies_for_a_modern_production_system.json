{"id":"324711804_Industrie_40_-_Competencies_for_a_modern_production_system","abstract":"Industrie 4.0 promises new digital solutions to optimize the entire value stream in manufacturing systems. Existing production systems are often based on the continuous improvement philosophy of lean management. New opportunities for developments arise from the combination of Industrie 4.0 and Lean. While the qualification of employees for such complex production environments plays a key role, the learning factory concept offers a promising approach to competency development in this field. In this paper, required competencies to enable a successful integration of lean management and Industrie 4.0 are discussed and analyzed. Furthermore, they are structured and presented in a comprehensive Lean 4.0 curriculum.","authors":["Judith Enke","Rupert Glass","Antonio Kre√ü","Jens Hambach"],"meta":["January 2018Procedia Manufacturing 23:267-272","DOI:10.1016/j.promfg.2018.04.028"],"references":["317509281_Value_stream_mapping_40_Holistic_examination_of_value_stream_and_information_logistics_in_production","306426761_Cyber-physical_systems_in_manufacturing","279070666_Competency-oriented_Design_of_Learning_Modules","323836518_Lean_40_Durch_Digitalisierung_die_nachste_Stufe_der_Exzellenz_erreichen_-_der_Darmstadter_Ansatz","318502195_Learning_factories_for_future_oriented_research_and_education_in_manufacturing","248039265_The_Toyota_Way_14_Management_Principles_From_The_World's_Greatest_Manufacturer"]}
