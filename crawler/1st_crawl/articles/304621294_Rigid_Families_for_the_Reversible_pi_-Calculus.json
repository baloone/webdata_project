{"id":"304621294_Rigid_Families_for_the_Reversible_pi_-Calculus","abstract":"Rigid families, a causal model for concurrency based on configuration structures, can interpret CCS and the \\(\\pi \\)-calculus. However, it is also a causal model suited for reversible calculi. In this paper we use rigid families to give a denotational representation to the reversible \\(\\pi \\)-calculus. The reversible \\(\\pi \\)-calculus defines a causal semantics for the \\(\\pi \\)-calculus as well. We discuss the difference in the two causal representations, in rigid families and in the reversible \\(\\pi \\)-calculus.","authors":["Ioana Cristescu","Jean Krivine","Daniele Varacca"],"meta":["July 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-40578-0_1","Conference: International Conference on Reversible Computation"],"references":["281470326_Rigid_Families_for_CCS_and_the_p-calculus","279260530_Reversible_Barbed_Congruence_on_Configuration_Structures","276452076_Strategies_as_Concurrent_Processes","261157289_A_Compositional_Semantics_for_the_Reversible_p-Calculus","222701650_Reversibility_and_Models_for_Concurrency","220898624_Event_Structure_Semantics_for_CCS_and_Related_Languages","220700934_Reversible_Communicating_Systems","313516722_Configuration_structures","283364215_A_Reversible_Process_Calculus_and_the_Modelling_of_the_ERK_Signalling_Pathway","262234832_Event_Structure_Semantics_of_Parallel_Extrusion_in_the_Pi-Calculus","225576435_Refinement_of_actions_and_equivalence_notions_for_concurrent_systems","220700991_Reversing_Higher-Order_Pi","220690524_Communicating_and_Mobile_Systems_The_p-Calculus","3650648_Configuration_Structures"]}
