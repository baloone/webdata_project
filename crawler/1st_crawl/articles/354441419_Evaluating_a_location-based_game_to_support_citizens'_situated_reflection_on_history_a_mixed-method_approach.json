We use a mixed-method protocol to answer the following research questions: “Can a LBG be designed to stimulate situated reflection on social history topics? and “What form and type of reflections can occur when participating in a LBG? Using an innovative approach that took inspiration from the field of museum studies and computer science. We chose a Think-aloud protocol to conduct an evaluation in Valletta, Malta and adapted the Remind study protocol to explore participant experience in Luxembourg. We combined transcripts from both sets of experiments wiith user-generated content to complete a systematic analysis using a predefined set of qualitative codes. We were able to identify that LBG can support reflection on social history topics but the depth of and type of reflection depends on the social history content, the individual locations in the city, and personal connections players are able to make to both.","authors":["Catherine Jones"],"meta":["September 2021International Journal of Cartography 7(31):1-17","DOI:10.1080/23729333.2021.1964683"],"references":["321702432_Le_role_du_numerique_dans_la_redefinition_des_communs_urbains","319235134_REMIND_une_methode_pour_comprendre_la_micro-dynamique_de_l'experience_des_visiteurs_de_musees","262008155_The_real-time_city_Big_data_and_smart_urbanism","324558154_L'enaction_un_cadre_epistemologique_fecond_pour_la_recherche_en_SIC","316614029_Board_Game_Prototyping_to_Co-Design_a_Better_Location-Based_Digital_Game","301486910_Everyday_life_and_locative_play_an_exploration_of_Foursquare_and_playful_engagements_with_space_and_place","290300425_How_Modernity_Forgets","274326650_Place_and_Placelessness","273074364_The_Economy_of_Cities","263566499_Mobile_Interfaces_in_Public_Spaces_Locational_Privacy_Control_and_Urban_Sociability","236686616_Experience_de_visite_et_construction_des_connaissances_le_cas_des_musees_de_sciences_et_des_centres_de_culture_scientifique","30051673_Contributions_to_Geography_The_Spaces_of_Heidegger's_Beitrage","234632466_Assessing_Reflective_Responses_in_Journals","223139090_Reflection_in_Teacher-Education_-_Towards_Definition_and_Implementation"]}
