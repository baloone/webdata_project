{"id":"323557788_Automatic_3-dimensional_cephalometric_landmarking_based_on_active_shape_models_in_related_projections","abstract":"Introduction: \nThis article presents a novel technique for automatic cephalometric landmark localization on 3-dimensional (3D) cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) volumes by using an active shape model to search for landmarks in related projections.\n\nMethods: \nTwenty-four random CBCT scans from a public data set were imported and processed into Matlab (MathWorks, Natick, Mass). Orthogonal coronal and sagittal projections (digitally reconstructed radiographs) were created, and 2 trained active shape models were used to locate cephalometric landmarks on each. Finally, by relating projections, 18 tridimensional landmarks were located on CBCT volume representations.\n\nResults: \nFrom our 3D gold standard, a 3.64-mm mean error in localization of cephalometric landmarks was achieved with this method, with the highest localization errors in the porion and sella regions because of the low volume definition.\n\nConclusions: \nThe proposed algorithm for automatic 3D landmarking on CBCT volumes seems to be useful for 3D cephalometric analysis. This study shows that a fast 2-dimensional landmark search can be useful for 3D localization, which could save computational time compared with a full-volume analysis. Also, this research confirms that by using CBCT for cephalometry, there are no distortion projections, and full structure information of a virtual patient is manageable in a personal computer.","authors":["Jesús Montúfar","Marcelo Romero","Rogelio J Scougall-Vilchis"],"meta":["March 2018American journal of orthodontics and dentofacial orthopedics: official publication of the American Association of Orthodontists, its constituent societies, and the American Board of Orthodontics 153(3):449-458","DOI:10.1016/j.ajodo.2017.06.028","Project: CONACyT"],"references":["307905310_Reeb_Graph_for_Automatic_3D_Cephalometry","258501065_The_Virtual_Skeleton_Database_An_Open_Access_Repository_for_Biomedical_Research_and_Collaboration","233909530_Accuracy_of_computerized_automatic_identification_of_cephalometric_landmarks_by_a_designed_software","229155663_GPU_Accelerated_Generation_of_Digitally_Reconstructed_Radiographs_for_2-D3-D_Image_Registration","220611527_Use_of_active_shape_models_for_locating_structures_in_medical_images","13420871_A_new_volumetric_CT_machine_for_dental_imaging_based_on_the_cone-beam_technique_Preliminary_results","7795764_The_effect_of_head_rotation_on_cephalometric_radiographs","5554470_In_Vivo_Comparison_of_Conventional_and_Cone-Beam_CT-Synthesized_Cephalograms","319207907_Pattern_Classification","304608191_Computer-aided_cephalometric_landmark_annotation_for_CBCT_data","284935847_Ferraro's_Fundamentals_of_Maxillofacial_Surgery","278332633_A_Novel_Hybrid_Approach_for_Cephalometric_Landmark_Detection","274644650_A_knowledge-based_algorithm_for_automatic_detection_of_cephalometric_landmarks_on_CBCT_images","259528583_Medical_Image_Fusion_A_survey_of_the_state_of_the_art","224102754_Algorithm_for_Computer_Control_of_a_Digital_Plotter","12708793_Craniofacial_imaging_in_orthodontics_Historical_perspective_current_status_and_future_developments","11518388_Effect_of_Head_Rotation_on_Posteroanterior_Cephalometric_Radiographs","7058659_Digitally_reconstructed_radiograph_generation_by_an_adaptive_Monte_Carlo_method","6885292_Reproducibility_of_soft_tissue_landmarks_on_three-dimensional_facial_scans","5923561_Accuracy_of_linear_measurements_from_imaging_plate_and_lateral_cephalometric_images_derived_from_cone-beam_computed_tomography"]}
