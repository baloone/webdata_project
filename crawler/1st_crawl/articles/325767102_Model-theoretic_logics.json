{"id":"325767102_Model-theoretic_logics","abstract":"Since their inception, the Perspectives in Logic and Lecture Notes in Logic series have published seminal works by leading logicians. Many of the original books in the series have been unavailable for years, but they are now in print once again. This volume, the eighth publication in the Perspectives in Logic series, brings together several directions of work in model theory between the late 1950s and early 1980s. It contains expository papers by pre-eminent researchers. Part I provides an introduction to the subject as a whole, as well as to the basic theory and examples. The rest of the book addresses finitary languages with additional quantifiers, infinitary languages, second-order logic, logics of topology and analysis, and advanced topics in abstract model theory. Many chapters can be read independently.","authors":["J. Barwise","S.
