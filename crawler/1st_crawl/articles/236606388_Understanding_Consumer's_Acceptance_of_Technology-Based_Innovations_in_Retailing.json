{"id":"236606388_Understanding_Consumer's_Acceptance_of_Technology-Based_Innovations_in_Retailing","abstract":"The availability of a huge number of studies about the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) for predicting consumer’s acceptance and usage of innovations in points of sale motivates writing of the present. Review, with emphasis on the new variables integrated in the traditional model. This is concerned with a synthesis of the current progresses in the field, thus offering a unified view of consumers’ behaviour towards new technical solutions. Such synthesis is achieved from an extensive literature analysis, including computer science, innovation, human-computer interaction, and technology management perspectives. For each case, both opportunities and issues are outlined in order to advance the current knowledge and highlight what practitioners and scholars should take into account for developing new and efficient corporate strategies.","authors":["Eleonora Pantano","Loredana Di Pietro"],"meta":["December 2012Journal of Technology Management and Innovation 7(4)","DOI:10.4067/S0718-27242012000400001"],"references":["262762702_Acceptance_of_Smartphone_in_Enhancing_Patient-Caregivers_Relationship","314450643_Effect_of_the_Food_Traceability_System_for_Building_Trust_Price_Premium_and_Buying_Behavior","305965867_The_Co-Creation_of_a_Retail_Innovation_Shoppers_and_the_Early_Supermarket_in_Britain","292925440_The_impact_of_flow_on_online_consumer_behavior","275293731_Trust_and_economic_growth_a_robustness_analysis","270799699_Social_Network_for_the_Choice_of_Tourist_Destination_Attitude_and_Behavioral_Intention","269785763_Consumers'_Expectation_of_innovation_in_Traditional_Points_of_Sale_An_explorative_study","265495698_Perceived_risk_of_information_security_and_privacy_in_online_shopping_A_study_of_environmentally_sustainable_products","264004005_Perceived_Behavioral_Control_Self-Efficacy_Locus_of_Control_and_the_Theory_of_Planned_Behavior","263656366_Explaining_Internet_Banking_Behavior_Theory_of_Reasoned_Action_Theory_of_Planned_Behavior_or_Technology_Acceptance_Model"]}
