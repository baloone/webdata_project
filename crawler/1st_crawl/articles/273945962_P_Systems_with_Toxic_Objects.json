{"id":"273945962_P_Systems_with_Toxic_Objects","abstract":"We introduce the new concept of toxic objects, objects that must not stay idle as otherwise the computation is abandoned without yielding a result. P systems of many kinds using toxic objects allow for smaller descriptional complexity, especially for smaller numbers of rules, as trap rules can be avoided. Besides presenting a number of tiny P systems generating or accepting non-semilinear sets of (vectors of) natural numbers with very small numbers of rules, we also improve the results for catalytic and purely catalytic P systems: 14 rules for generating a non-semilinear vector set and 29 rules for generating a non-semilinear number set are sufficient when allowing only the minimal number of two and three catalysts, respectively; moreover, with using toxic objects, these numbers can be reduced to 11 and 17 . Yet only 23 rules – without using toxic objects – are needed if we allow for using more catalysts, i.e., five for catalytic P systems and seven catalysts for purely catalytic P systems.","authors":["Artiom Alhazov","Rudolf Freund"],"meta":["August 2014Lecture Notes in Computer Science 8961:99-125","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-14370-5_7","Conference: International Conference on Membrane Computing"],"references":["265579227_Flattening_in_Tissue_P_Systems","221055464_Computational_Completeness_of_P_Systems_with_Active_Membranes_and_Two_Polarizations","31593969_Handbook_of_Formal_Languages","344520881_Regulated_Rewriting_in_Formal_Language_Theory","296838687_A_Catalytic_P_System_with_Two_Catalysts_Generating_a_Non-Semilinear_Set","290842550_Improved_Universality_Proof_for_Catalytic_P_Systems_and_a_Relation_to_Non-Semilinear_Sets","285059739_The_Mathematical_Theory_of_L_Systems","279292707_Catalytic_and_Purely_Catalytic_P_Systems_and_P_Automata_Control_Mechanisms_for_Obtaining_Computational_Completeness","273946121_Small_P_Systems_Defining_Non-semilinear_Sets","268609752_Membrane_Computing_An_Introduction","268054690_Regulated_rewriting_in_formel_language_theory","267104835_Further_results_on_P_systems_with_promotersinhibitors","262250207_Asynchronous_and_Maximally_Parallel_Deterministic_Controlled_Non-cooperative_P_Systems_Characterize_NFIN_and_coNFIN","234807858_Computation_Finite_and_Infinite_Machines","234780369_The_Oxford_Handbook_of_Membrane_Computing","223827187_Computing_with_membranes_J_Comput_Syst_Sci","222397668_Computationally_universal_P_systems_without_priorities_Two_catalysts_are_sufficient","221563790_Membrane_Systems_Using_Noncooperative_Rules_with_Unconditional_Halting","220964420_One_and_Two_Polarizations_Membrane_Creation_and_Objects_Complexity_in_P_Systems","220662148_On_symportantiport_P_systems_with_a_small_number_of_objects","220530877_Special_Variants_of_P_Systems_Inducing_an_Infinite_Hierarchy_with_Respect_to_the_Number_of_Membranes","220118341_A_quick_introduction_to_membrane_computing","220111143_P_systems_without_multiplicities_of_symbol-objects","46585015_Minimization_Strategies_for_Maximally_Parallel_Multiset_Rewriting_Systems","2627340_Computing_with_Membranes_A_Variant"]}
