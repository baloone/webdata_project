It is shown that if the underlying field has more than n elements, then: Let L be an affine space of n×n matrices all having rank at least k. It is shown that if the underlying field is algebraically closed, then The last result is applied to a problem of Valiant concerning permanents and determinants.","authors":["Roy Meshulam"],"meta":["March 1989Linear Algebra and its Applications 114:261-271","DOI:10.1016/0024-3795(89)90465-5"],"references":["312443650_On_nilalgebras_and_linear_varieties_of_nilpotent_matrices_II","238875065_On_the_maximal_rank_in_a_subspace_of_matrices","238738745_Graph_Theory_An_Introductory_Course","228057841_Combinatorial_Problems_Exercises","222808307_The_Complexity_of_Computing_the_Permanent","222436692_Permanent_and_determinant","38335621_On_Nilalgebras_and_Linear_Varieties_of_Nilpotent_Matrices_III","31062686_On_Spaces_of_Linear_Transformations_with_Bounded_Rank"]}
