{"id":"290109774_Simultaneous_Feature_and_Dictionary_Learning_for_Image_Set_Based_Face_Recognition","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a simultaneous feature and dictionary learning (SFDL) method for image set based face recognition, where each training and testing example contains a face image set captured from different poses, illuminations, expressions and resolutions. While several feature learning and dictionary learning methods have been proposed for image set based face recognition in recent years, most of them learn the features and dictionaries separately, which may not be powerful enough because some discriminative information for dictionary learning may be compromised in the feature learning stage if they are applied sequentially, and vice versa. To address this, we propose a SFDL method to learn discriminative features and dictionaries simultaneously from raw face images so that discriminative information can be jointly exploited. Extensive experimental results on four widely used face datasets show that our method achieves better performance than state-of-the-art image set based face recognition methods.","authors":["Jiwen Lu","Gang Wang","Weihong Deng","Pierre Moulin"],"meta":["September 2014","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-10590-1_18","Conference: European Conference on Computer Vision"],"references":["264597133_Learning_Discriminative_Hierarchical_Features_for_Object_Recognition","262239891_Dictionary-Based_Face_Recognition_from_Video","224164300_Face_Recognition_Based_on_Image_Sets","221620168_Efficient_sparse_coding_algorithms","221364959_Learning_A_Discriminative_Dictionary_for_Sparse_Coding_via_Label_Consistent_K-SVD","221364124_Face_tracking_and_recognition_with_visual_constraints_in_real-world_videos","221363014_Discriminative_learned_dictionaries_for_local_image_analysis","221362948_Discriminative_K-SVD_for_dictionary_learning_in_face_recognition","221362061_Manifold-Manifold_Distance_with_application_to_face_recognition_based_on_image_set","221110091_Fisher_Discrimination_Dictionary_Learning_for_sparse_representation","220660094_Robust_Real-Time_Face_Detection","51976758_Face_Recognition_Using_Sparse_Approximated_Nearest_Points_between_Image_Sets","6397815_Discriminative_Learning_and_Recognition_of_Image_Set_Classes_Using_Canonical_Correlations","4246328_Locally_Linear_Models_on_Face_Appearance_Manifolds_with_Application_to_Dual-Subspace_Based_Classification","4022913_Video-based_face_recognition_using_probabilistic_appearance_manifolds","3745216_Face_recognition_using_temporal_image_sequence","3319912_K-SVD_An_Algorithm_for_Designing_Overcomplete_Dictionaries_for_Sparse_Representation","289358818_Max-margin_multiple-instance_dictionary_learning","269132788_Side-Information_based_Linear_Discriminant_Analysis_for_Face_Recognition","268265707_ICA_with_Reconstruction_Cost_for_Efficient_Overcomplete_Feature_Learning","262326696_Discriminative_Dictionary_Learning_with_Pairwise_Constraints","262240553_Image_Set_Classification_Using_Holistic_Multiple_Order_Statistics_Features_and_Localized_Multi-kernel_Metric_Learning","262162161_A_Dictionary_Learning_Approach_for_Classification_Separating_the_Particularity_and_the_Commonality","262025691_Co-Learned_Multi-View_Spectral_Clustering_for_Face_Recognition_Based_on_Image_Sets","261502521_Covariance_discriminative_learning_A_natural_and_efficient_approach_to_image_set_classification","261321961_Incoherent_dictionary_learning_for_sparse_representation","261161993_Sparse_representation_for_face_recognition_based_on_discriminative_low-rank_dictionary_learning","261154750_Image_sets_alignment_for_Video-Based_Face_Recognition","261115598_Face_recognition_based_on_regularized_nearest_points_between_image_sets","261115387_Video-based_face_recognition_via_joint_sparse_representation","260665415_Image-to-Set_Face_Recognition_Using_Locality_Repulsion_Projections_and_Sparse_Reconstruction-Based_Similarity_Measure","257531007_Transform-Invariant_PCA_A_Unified_Approach_to_Fully_Automatic_Face_Alignment_Representation_and_Recognition","229426067_Extended_SRC_Undersampled_Face_Recognition_via_Intra-Class_Variant_Dictionary","225432456_Face_Recognition_from_Long-Term_Observations","224254875_Face_recognition_in_unconstrained_videos_with_matched_background_similarity","224219308_Dictionary_Learning","221362739_Sparse_Approximated_Nearest_Points_for_Image_Set_Classification","221361556_Manifold_Discriminant_Analysis","221292051_From_Still_Image_to_Video-Based_Face_Recognition_An_Experimental_Analysis","221121224_Metaface_learning_for_sparse_representation_based_face_recognition","51999356_Relations_between_2_sets_of_variants","4232769_Incremental_kernel_SVD_for_face_recognition_with_image_sets","4156215_Face_recognition_with_image_sets_using_manifold_density_divergence","4022955_Joint_manifold_distance_a_new_approach_to_appearance_based_clustering","2941192_The_CMU_motion_of_body_MoBo_database"]}
