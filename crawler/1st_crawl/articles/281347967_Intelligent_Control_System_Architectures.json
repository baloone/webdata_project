{"id":"281347967_Intelligent_Control_System_Architectures","abstract":"The design of sociorobots can be performed efficiently by exploiting some kind of structured framework, in order to integrate and implement the underlying perception, cognition, learning, control, and social interaction functions. This necessity has motivated the development of many different intelligent control archi-tectures with particular features, advantages, and weaknesses. This chapter starts by providing a discussion of the basic functional design requirements, and an outline of the two early seminal behavior-based control architectures, namely the subsumption and motor schemas architectures, Then, the chapter describes three important newer architectures, namely a 4-layer architecture, the deliberative-reactive architecture, and the combined symbolic/ subsumption/ servo-control (SSS) architecture. A general discussion and categorization of the characteristics of the intelligent control archi-tectures is also included. All these architectures were used successfully in many available sociorobots.","authors":["Spyros G.
