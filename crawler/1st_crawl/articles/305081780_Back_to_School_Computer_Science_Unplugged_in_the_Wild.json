{"id":"305081780_Back_to_School_Computer_Science_Unplugged_in_the_Wild","abstract":"We report on case studies of using Computer Science Unplugged material as an alternative teaching method for computer science. The scope and target audiences for these studies were determined based upon reported classroom use of \"unplugged\" material by teachers. Our studies revalidate previous findings across multiple institutions and a broader student population and shows that, at least for the scenarios studied, \"unplugged\" activities are equally efficient compared to teaching using textbooks or interactive methods.","authors":["Renate Thies","Jan Vahrenhold"],"meta":["July 2016","DOI:10.1145/2899415.2899442","Conference: the 2016 ACM Conference"],"references":["266882704_Computer_Science_Unplugged_school_students_doing_real_computing_without_computers","241623893_CS_Unplugged_and_Middle-School_Students'_Views_Attitudes_and_Intentions_Regarding_CS","221437653_New_Methodology_of_Information_Education_with_Computer_Science_Unplugged","220808373_Teaching_CS_unplugged_in_the_high_school_with_limited_success","291052695_Binary_Search","276441911_Reaching_a_Broader_Population_of_Students_through_Unplugged_Activities","262221657_On_plugging_unplugged_into_CS_classes","254007493_Reflections_on_outreach_programs_in_CS_classes_Learning_objectives_for_unplugged_activities","240723575_The_Effects_of_Summer_Vacation_on_Achievement_Test_Scores_A_Narrative_and_Meta-Analytic_Review","44561699_Evaluating_the_Quality_of_Learning_the_SOLO_Taxonomy","29486913_Computer_Science_Unplugged_An_enrichment_and_extension_programme_for_primary-aged_children"]}
