{"id":"300897674_Sheet2RDF_a_Flexible_and_Dynamic_Spreadsheet_ImportLifting_Framework_for_RDF","abstract":"In this paper, we introduce Sheet2RDF, a platform for the acquisition and transformation of spreadsheets into RDF datasets. Based on Apache UIMA and CODA, two wider-scoped frameworks respectively aimed at knowledge acquisition from unstructured information and RDF triplification, Sheet2RDF narrows down their capabilities in order to restrict the domain of acquisition to spreadsheets, thus taking into consideration their peculiarities and providing informed solutions facilitating the transformation process, while still exploiting their full potentialities. Sheet2RDF comes also bundled in the form of a plugin for two RDF management platforms: Semantic Turkey and VocBench. The integration with such platforms enhances the level of automatism in the process, thanks to a human-computer interface that can exploit suggestions by users and translate them into proper transformation rules. In addition, it strengthens this interaction by direct contact with the data/vocabularies edited in the platform.","authors":["Manuel Fiorelli","Tiziano Lorenzetti","Pazienza Maria Teresa","Armando Stellato"],"meta":["June 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-19066-2_13","Conference: International Conference on Industrial, Engineering and Other Applications of Applied Intelligent Systems"],"references":["323693998_Thesaurus_maintenance_alignment_and_publication_as_linked_data_the_AGROVOC_use_case","300883888_VocBench_A_Web_Application_for_Collaborative_Development_of_Multilingual_Thesauri","300706977_Semi-automatic_Knowledge_Acquisition_through_CODA","280113309_CSV2RDF_User-Driven_CSV_to_RDF_Mass_Conversion_Framework","262283008_Semantic_Turkey_A_browser-integrated_environment_for_knowledge_acquisition_and_management","262214781_Semantic_Turkey_A_browser-integrated_environment_for_knowledge_acquisition_and_management","261718893_CODA_Computer-aided_Ontology_Development_Architecture","232088324_PEARL_ProjEction_of_Annotations_Rule_Language_a_Language_for_Projecting_UIMA_Annotations_over_RDF_Knowledge_Bases","247695563_Systems_of_Knowledge_Organization_for_Digital_Libraries_Beyond_Traditional_Authority_Files","236735848_Thesaurus_maintenance_alignment_and_publication_as_linked_data_The_AGROOVOC_use_case"]}
