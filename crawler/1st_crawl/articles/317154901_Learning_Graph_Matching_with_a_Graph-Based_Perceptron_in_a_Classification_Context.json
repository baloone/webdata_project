{"id":"317154901_Learning_Graph_Matching_with_a_Graph-Based_Perceptron_in_a_Classification_Context","abstract":"Many tasks in computer vision and pattern recognition are formulated as graph matching problems. Despite the NP-hard nature of the problem, fast and accurate approximations have led to significant progress in a wide range of applications. Learning graph matching functions from observed data, however, still remains a challenging issue. This paper presents an effective scheme to parametrize a graph model for object matching in a classification context. For this, we propose a representation based on a parametrized model graph, and optimize it to increase a classification rate. Experimental evaluations on real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness (in terms of accuracy and speed) of our approach against graph classification with hand-crafted cost functions.","authors":["Romain Raveaux","Maxime Martineau","Donatello Conte","Gilles Venturini"],"meta":["May 2017Lecture Notes in Computer Science","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-58961-9_5","Conference: International Workshop on Graph-Based Representations in Pattern Recognition"],"references":["283619077_Learning_Graph_Matching_Substitution_Weights_Based_on_the_Ground_Truth_Node_Correspondence","261868622_Learning_Graphs_to_Match","345916033_Bridging_the_Gap_between_Graph_Edit_Distance_and_Kernel_Machines","306036993_Advances_in_Computer_Vision_and_Pattern_Recognition","271710860_Learning_graph-matching_edit-costs_based_on_the_optimality_of_the_oracle's_node_correspondences","266959712_Bridging_the_Gap_Between_Graph_Edit_Distance_and_Kernel_Machines","262491753_Fast_computation_of_Bipartite_graph_matching","256969223_Structured_Representations_in_a_Content_Based_Image_Retrieval_Context","229461678_Two_New_Graphs_Kernels_in_Chemoinformatics","222976642_A_graph_matching_method_and_a_graph_matching_distance_based_on_subgraph_assignments"]}
