{"id":"316080745_Why_Designing_Is_Not_Experimenting_Design_Methods_Epistemic_Praxis_and_Strategies_of_Knowledge_Acquisition_in_Architecture","abstract":"Using the example of architecture, this article defends the thesis that designing should not be regarded as a kind of experimenting. This is in contrast to a widespread methodological claim that design processes are equivalent to experimentation processes. The contrary thesis can be proven by focusing on actual practices, techniques and design strategies. Closely connected with the thesis is an even more important epistemological claim, which contends that designing serves not only to develop artefacts but is also a means of acquiring genuine knowledge. When the epistemic relevance of said practices, techniques and strategies is reassessed, designing emerges clearly as an independent epistemic praxis. To defend the thesis, the present article draws on and analyses empirical material from an ethnographic field study in order to back up the conceptual analysis.","authors":["Sabine Ammon"],"meta":["December 2017Philosophy & Technology 30(4):1-26","DOI:10.1007/s13347-017-0256-4"],"references":["349154326_Multilinguale_Multi-Sited_Ethnography","333293552_Ars_heute_Perspektiven_einer_Entwurfswissenschaft_der_Architektur","333281811_Epistemische_Dissonanz_Zur_Vervielfaltigung_von_Entwurfsalternativen_in_der_Architektur","333026320_Laboratory_Life_The_Construction_of_Scientific_Facts","330354062_The_philosophy_of_science_A_companion","324285865_Considered_Judgment","323002036_Building_Information_Modeling","321563473_Konstruktionslehre_Grundlagen_erfolgreicher_Produktentwicklung_Methoden_und_Anwendung","320181779_Languages_of_Art_An_Approach_to_a_Theory_of_Symbols","318331281_Epilogue_The_Rise_of_Imagery_in_the_Age_of_Modeling"]}
