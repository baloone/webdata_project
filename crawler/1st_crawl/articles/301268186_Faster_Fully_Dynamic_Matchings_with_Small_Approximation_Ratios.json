{"id":"301268186_Faster_Fully_Dynamic_Matchings_with_Small_Approximation_Ratios","abstract":"We maintain the approximate matching without explicitly using augmenting paths. We define an intermediate graph, called an EDCS and show that the EDCS H contains a large matching, and show how to maintain an EDCS in G. The EDCS was used in previous works on bipartite graphs, however the details and proofs are completely different in general graphs. The algorithm for bipartite graphs relies on ideas from flows and cuts to non-constructively prove the existence of a good matching in H, but these ideas do not seem to extend to non-bipartite graphs. In this paper we instead explicitly construct a large fractional matching in H. In some cases we can guarantee that this fractional matching is γ-restricted, which means that it only uses values either in the range [0, γ] or 1. We then combine this matching with a new structural property of maximum matchings in non-bipartite graphs, which is analogous to the cut induced by maximum matchings in bipartite graphs.","authors":["Aaron Bernstein","Cliff Stein"],"meta":["January 2016","DOI:10.1137/1.9781611974331.ch50","Conference: Proceedings of the Twenty-Seventh Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms"],"references":["279310645_Fully_Dynamic_Matching_in_Bipartite_Graphs","264276592_3SUM_Hardness_in_Dynamic_Data_Structures","259151362_Orienting_Fully_Dynamic_Graphs_with_Worst-Case_Time_Bounds","224500350_Online_Bipartite_Perfect_Matching_With_Augmentations","302563492_Online_Bipartite_Matching_in_Offline_Time_Abstract","283912934_Maintaining_Assignments_Online_Matching_Scheduling_and_Flows","269116826_Deterministic_Fully_Dynamic_Data_Structures_for_Vertex_Cover_and_Matching","267465839_Fractional_Graph_Theory_--_A_Rational_Approach","261959281_Linear-Time_Approximation_for_Maximum_Weight_Matching","261056395_Fully_Dynamic_1_e-Approximate_Matchings"]}
