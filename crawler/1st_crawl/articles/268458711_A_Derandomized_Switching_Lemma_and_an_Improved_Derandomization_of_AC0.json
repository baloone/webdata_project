{"id":"268458711_A_Derandomized_Switching_Lemma_and_an_Improved_Derandomization_of_AC0","abstract":"We describe a new pseudorandom generator for AC0. Our generator $\\epsilon$-fools circuits of depth $d$ and size $M$ and uses a seed of length $\\tilde O( \\log^{d+4} M/\\epsilon)$. The previous best construction for $d \\geq 3$ was due to Nisan, and had seed length $O(\\log^{2d+6} M/\\epsilon)$. A seed length of $O(\\log^{2d + \\Omega(1)} M)$ is best possible given Nisan-type generators and the current state of circuit lower bounds. Seed length $\\Omega(\\log^d M/\\epsilon)$ is a barrier for any pseudorandom generator construction given the current state of circuit lower bounds. For $d=2$, a pseudorandom generator of seed length $\\tilde O(\\log2 M/\\epsilon)$ was known. Our generator is based on a ''pseudorandom restriction'' generator which outputs restrictions that satisfy the conclusions of the H\\aa stad Switching Lemma and that uses a seed of polylogarithmic length.","authors":["Luca Trevisan","Tongke Xue"],"meta":["June 2013Proceedings of the Annual IEEE Conference on Computational Complexity","DOI:10.1109/CCC.2013.32","Conference: 2013 IEEE Conference on Computational Complexity (CCC)"],"references":["267482782_Polylogarithmic_Independence_Can_Fool_DNF_Formulas","261455614_Pseudorandomness_from_Shrinkage","234826393_Polylogarithmic_Independence_Fools_AC0_Circuits","234802744_A_Simple_Proof_of_Bazzi's_Theorem","231513058_Better_Pseudorandom_Generators_from_Milder_Pseudorandom_Restrictions","225761534_Improved_Pseudorandom_Generators_for_Depth_2_Circuits","224586730_Poly-logarithmic_Independence_Fools_AC0_Circuits","220441383_Pseudorandom_bits_for_constant_depth_circuits","220138649_A_simple_proof_of_Bazzi's_theorem","220058934_A_Simple_Proof_of_Bazzi's_Theorem","4355011_Deterministic_simulation_of_probabilistic_constant_depth_circuits","4294389_Polylogarithmic_Independence_Can_Fool_DNF_Formulas","2631399_Almost_Optimal_Lower_Bounds_for_Small_Depth_Circuits"]}
