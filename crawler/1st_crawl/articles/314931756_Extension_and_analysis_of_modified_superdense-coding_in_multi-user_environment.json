{"id":"314931756_Extension_and_analysis_of_modified_superdense-coding_in_multi-user_environment","abstract":"Modified superdense coding for quantum systems was introduced for two communicating parties. In this paper the algorithm is extended to n parties. Beside the generalization, an analytical approach is also presented to show the performance of the algorithm, along with the comparison of slotted ALOHA systems.","authors":["Marton Berces","Sandor Imre"],"meta":["September 2015","DOI:10.1109/INES.2015.7329723","Conference: 2015 IEEE 19th International Conference on Intelligent Engineering Systems (INES)"],"references":["234802142_ALOHA_Packet_System_With_and_Without_Slots_and_Capture","234790393_THE_ALOHA_SYSTEM_another_alternative_for_computer_communications","263872309_EXTREME_VALUE_SEARCHING_IN_UNSORTED_DATABASES_BASED_ON_QUANTUM_COMPUTING","245601492_Can_quantum_mechancial_description_of_physics_be_considered_complete","234411650_Sending_classical_information_via_noisy_quantum_channels","232143720_Quantum_Hyperdense_Coding_for_Distributed_Communications","228803044_Quantum_Computing_and_Communications_-_An_Engineering_Approach","200703048_Can_Quantum-Mechanical_Description_of_Physical_Reality_Be_Considered_Complete","13242964_Communication_via_one-_and_two-particle_operators_on_Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen_states"]}
