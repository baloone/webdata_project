This work has beendeveloped in the frame and in the context of the European project Micro-Technologies and Systemsfor Robot-Assisted Laser Phonomicrosurgery entitled μRALP.On the one hand, needs and limits of medical aspects have been abstracted to create the microrobotspecifications. On the other hand, the state-of-the-art has identified the technological stumblingblocks and has allowed to led to our proposition to satisfy the specifications. This work has envisagedthe fabrication of two independent parallel microrobotic structures. Each proposed microrobot hasa different kinematic structure, however they have the same objective that is to guide a laser beamonto the vocal folds. To this purpose, a mirror is placed on the end-effector of both microrobots inorder to reflect and guide the laser beam. Smart Composite Microstructures fabrication techniquewas used to fabricate the two microrobots. Moreover, piezoelectric cantilever actuators have beenused to generate the required rotations. Finally, the expected precision for laser microsurgery of thevocal folds was reached by coupling the feedforward compensation of nonlinearities and vibrations ofthe actuators with visual feedback control of the parallel kinematic mechanism.","authors":["Sergio Andrée Lescano"],"meta":["June 2015"],"references":["300329955_Overview_of_Micro_Cutting","287235483_On_the_exponentiation_of_interval_matrices","280096230_Design_and_Validation_of_a_Medical_Robotic_System_for_Laser_Phonomicrosurgery","274382153_Modeling_of_Creep_for_Structural_Analysis","262864903_A_5-mm_piezo-scanning_fiber_device_for_high_speed_ultrafast_laser_microsurgery","260779332_Preliminary_variation_on_multiview_geometry_for_vision-guided_laser_surgery","259484807_Piezoelectric_Multilayer_Beam_Bending_Actuators_Static_and_Dynamic_Behavior_and_Aspects_of_Sensor_Integration_ISBN_978-3-540-32641-0","257953313_Micromachining_along_a_curve_Femtosecond_laser_micromachining_of_curved_profiles_in_diamond_and_silicon_using_accelerating_beams","257775815_Robotic_Microassembly_and_micromanipulation_at_FEMTO-ST","257399786_Applications_of_femtosecond_Bessel_beams_to_laser_ablation","245286627_Generalized_Bouc-Wen_Model_for_Highly_Asymmetric_Hysteresis","242546100_Optical_micro-endoscopes_for_3D_in-vivo_imaging","348051635_A_Flat_High-Frequency_Scanning_Micromirror","329162007_Compliant_Mechanisms_Design_of_Flexure_Hinges","326612702_Hybrid_vision-based_robot_control_robust_to_large_calibration_errors_on_both_intrinsic_and_extrinsic_camera_parameters","324456278_Mathematical_Association_of_America","321600121_Signal_Measurement_and_Estimation_Techniques_for_Micro_and_Nanotechnology","316791795_CO2_Laser_Cutting","313151486_Phonosurgery_Basic_and_Clinical_Investigations","301436652_Multivariable_Generalized_Bouc-Wen_Modeling_Identification_and_Feedforward_Control_and_Its_Application_to_Multi-DoF_Piezoelectric_Actuators","294708732_Virtual-Chain_Approach_for_the_Type_Synthesis_of_Parallel_Mechanisms","285944411_Piezoelectric-Based_Vibration_Control_From_Macro_to_MicroNano_Scale_Systems","285355978_Ultrafast_Optics","281654909_Fundamental_Principles_of_Optical_Lithography_The_Science_of_Microfabrication","281075707_Robotique_medicale","279957813_Solid_Mechanics_and_Its_Applications","266436696_An_Introduction_to_Ray_Tracing","264630258_Materials_design_Folding_structures_out_of_flat_materials","264580066_Posicast_Control_of_Damped_Oscillatory_Systems","262231483_Demonstrating_kHz_Frequency_Actuation_for_Conducting_Polymer_Microactuators","261416072_Interval_analysis_for_robot_precision_evaluation","261122717_Characterization_of_a_2-DoF_MEMS_nanopositioner_with_integrated_electrothermal_actuation_and_sensing","260707601_A_2-DOF_electrostatically_actuated_MEMS_nanopositioner_for_on-chip_AFM","260357148_An_Origami-Inspired_Approach_to_Worm_Robots","260270444_A_Magnetic_MEMS_Actuator_Using_a_Permanent_Magnet_and_Magnetic_Fluid_Enclosed_in_a_Cavity_Sandwiched_by_Polymer_Diaphragms","259621869_Shape_memory_alloy_microvalves_for_a_fluidic_control_system","258710644_Endoscopic_Laser_Scalpel_for_Head_and_Neck_Cancer_Surgery","257868529_Laser_micro-_and_nanostructuring_using_femtosecond_Bessel_beams","252453713_Piezoelectricity_its_history_and_applications","251506730_Visionforce_control_of_parallel_robots","250928418_Mathematical_Models_of_Hysteresis","250004786_MEMS_Rotary_Engine_Power_System","249357688_High_Performance_''V-stack''_Piezoelectric_Actuator","246314892_Geometric_analysis_of_parallel_mechanisms","245934009_A_Direct_Determination_of_the_Instantaneous_Kinematics_of_Fully_Parallel_Robot_Manipulators","245366925_Microrobot_Design_Using_Fiber_Reinforced_Composites","245126555_On_the_velocity_analysis_of_interconnected_chains_mechanisms","245094787_A_Survey_of_Micro-Actuator_Technologies_for_Future_Spacecraft_Missions","243769417_Visual_Servoing_Real-Time_Control_of_Robot_Manipulators_Based_on_Visual_Sensory_Feedback","241912750_Compact_electrostatic_comb_actuator","241649585_Dynamic_visual_servoing_from_sequential_regions_of_interest_acquisition","241843823_Rays_waves_and_asymptotics","241699187_Electromagnetic_fields_and_human_body_A_new_challenge_for_the_electromagnetic_field_computation","241088839_3-D_printingThe_new_industrial_revolution","235978299_Analytical_analysis_of_a_circular_PZT_actuator_for_valveless_micropumps"]}
