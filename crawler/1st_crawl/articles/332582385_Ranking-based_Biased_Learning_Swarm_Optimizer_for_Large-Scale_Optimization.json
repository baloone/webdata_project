{"id":"332582385_Ranking-based_Biased_Learning_Swarm_Optimizer_for_Large-Scale_Optimization","abstract":"Large-scale optimization, solving real high-dimensional problems, has attracted many research interests. Large-scale optimization problems are far more difficult than traditional optimization problems due to their numerous local optimum. In this paper, a principle of maximizing the fitness difference between learners and exemplars is proposed to improve the performance of the optimization algorithm. Then based on the principle, a improved particle swarm optimization algorithm called the “ranking-based biased learning swarm optimizer for large-scale optimization” (RBLSO) is proposed. The proposed RBLSO contains two types of learning strategies, namely, ranking paired learning (RPL) and biased center learning (BCL). In RPL, the worse particles learn peer to peer from the better particles according to their ranks, so then the convergence speed will be accelerated. In BCL, each particle learns from the biased center that is defined as the fitness weighted center of the whole swarm. This operator is utilized to strengthen the explorative ability of the algorithm. To test the performances of the proposed algorithm, we conduct some experiments on the proposed learning mechanism. RBLSO is compared with several state-of-the-art large-scale optimization algorithms on two widely used benchmark function sets, CEC2010 and CEC2013. These two function sets were proposed for the special session and competition on large-scale global optimization held under the Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC) 2010 and 2013. Experimental results show that RBLSO is effective in solving large-scale optimization problems.","authors":["Hanbo Deng","Lizhi Peng","Haibo Zhang","Bo Yang"],"meta":["April 2019Information Sciences 493(3)","DOI:10.1016/j.ins.2019.04.037"],"references":["328893926_Competitive_Swarm_Optimizer_with_Dynamic_Grouping_for_Large_Scale_Optimization","327596672_A_new_stochastic_computing_paradigm_for_the_dynamics_of_nonlinear_singular_heat_conduction_model_of_the_human_head","326227174_A_new_stochastic_computing_paradigm_for_nonlinear_Painleve_II_systems_in_applications_of_random_matrix_theory","324014869_Large_Scale_Problems_in_Practice_The_effect_of_dimensionality_on_the_interaction_among_variables","317400694_Hybrid_Optimization_for_Economic_Deployment_of_ESS_in_PV-Integrated_EV_Charging_Stations","310620571_Comments_on_A_note_on_multi-objective_improved_teaching-learning_based_optimization_algorithm_MO-ITLBO","303321583_Topology_Selection_for_Particle_Swarm_Optimization","283151867_A_multi-objective_improved_teaching-learning-based_optimization_algorithm_for_unconstrained_and_constrained_optimization_functions","262610997_A_Competitive_Swarm_Optimizer_for_Large_Scale_Optimization","259350973_Multi-Strategy_Coevolving_Aging_Particle_Optimization","229000945_Particle_Swarm_Optimization_dynamic_system_analysis_for_parameter_selection_in_global_optimization_frameworks","224400363_Adaptive_Particle_Swarm_Optimization","224242870_Yao_X_Cooperatively_coevolving_particle_swarms_for_large_scale_optimization_IEEE_Trans_Evol_Comput_162_210-224","220380892_Orthogonal_Learning_Particle_Swarm_Optimization","220176034_Shuffle_or_update_parallel_differential_evolution_for_large-scale_optimization","3418789_A_Cooperative_Approach_to_Particle_Swarm_Optimization","328245507_Coevolutionary_Particle_Swarm_Optimization_With_Bottleneck_Objective_Learning_Strategy_for_Many-Objective_Optimization","327651223_A_study_on_rotation_invariance_in_differential_evolution","322822398_Neuro-Heuristics_for_Nonlinear_Singular_Thomas-Fermi_Systems","315963113_Niching_particle_swarm_optimization_techniques_for_multimodal_buckling_maximization_of_composite_laminates","315930933_A_Coevolutionary_Technique_Based_on_Multi-swarm_Particle_Swarm_Optimization_for_Dynamic_Multi-objective_Optimization","310658426_An_Energy_Efficient_Ant_Colony_System_for_Virtual_Machine_Placement_in_Cloud_Computing","309441810_Segment-Based_Predominant_Learning_Swarm_Optimizer_for_Large-Scale_Optimization","309228309_Time_varying_acceleration_coefficients_particle_swarm_optimisation_TVACPSO_A_new_optimisation_algorithm_for_estimating_parameters_of_PV_cells_and_modules","308495217_A_Fast_Feature_Weighting_Algorithm_of_Data_Gravitation_Classification","308188314_Exponential_Inertia_Weight_in_Particle_Swarm_Optimization","305820912_Cloudde_A_Heterogeneous_Differential_Evolution_Algorithm_and_Its_Distributed_Cloud_Version","277517826_Competitive_and_cooperative_particle_swarm_optimization_with_information_sharing_mechanism_for_global_optimization_problems","271448828_Dynamic_multi-swarm_particle_swarm_optimizer_with_cooperative_learning_strategy","265784661_A_social_learning_particle_swarm_optimization_algorithm_for_scalable_optimization","262147059_Improving_particle_swarm_optimization_using_multi-layer_searching_strategy","260621922_An_Adaptive_Particle_Swarm_Optimization_With_Multiple_Adaptive_Methods","260113742_An_analysis_on_separability_for_Memetic_Computing_automatic_design","256721009_Compact_Particle_Swarm_Optimization","234047478_Parallel_Memetic_Structures","220704547_Nonlinear_Inertia_Weight_Variation_for_Dynamic_Adaptation_in_Particle_Swarm_Optimization","220313199_Large_scale_evolutionary_optimization_using_cooperative_coevolution","220313185_Ockham's_Razor_in_Memetic_Computing_Three_Stage_Optimal_Memetic_Exploration","4116879_Choosing_a_starting_configuration_for_particle_swarm_optimization","4017046_Bare_bones_particle_swarms","3418684_Kennedy_J_The_Particle_Swarm_Explosion_Stability_and_Convergence_in_a_Multi-Dimensional_Complex_Space_IEEE_Trans_on_Evolutionary_Computation_6_58-73"]}
