{"id":"281805797_Activity_coefficients_of_KCl_in_several_mixed_electrolyte_solutions_at_25C","abstract":"The mean activity coefficients of KCl in aqueous MgCl2, CaCl2, BaCl2, MgSO4, and K2SO4 mixtures have been calculated from emf measurements at 25Â°C, all at a total ionic strength of 1. Results for the CaCl2 and BaCl2 systems agree with those reported using isopiestic measurements. The activity coefficients of KCl follow Harned's rule in MgCl2, deviate very slightly from linearity in CaCl2 and BaCl2, and display large curvatures in MgSO4 and K2SO4 solutions at this ionic strength.","authors":["P.G.
