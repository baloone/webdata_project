{"id":"353405478_Certain_Properties_of_Domination_in_Product_Vague_Graphs_With_an_Application_in_Medicine","abstract":"The product vague graph (PVG) is one of the most significant issues in fuzzy graph theory, which has many applications in the medical sciences today. The PVG can manage the uncertainty, connected to the unpredictable and unspecified data of all real-world problems, in which fuzzy graphs (FGs) will not conceivably ensue into generating adequate results. The limitations of previous definitions in FGs have led us to present new definitions in PVGs. Domination is one of the highly remarkable areas in fuzzy graph theory that have many applications in medical and computer sciences. Therefore, in this study, we introduce distinctive concepts and properties related to domination in product vague graphs such as the edge dominating set, total dominating set, perfect dominating set, global dominating set, and edge independent set, with some examples. Finally, we propose an implementation of the concept of a dominating set in medicine that is related to the COVID-19 pandemic.","authors":["Xiaolong Shi","Saeed Kosari"],"meta":["July 2021Frontiers in Physics 9:680634","DOI:10.3389/fphy.2021.680634"],"references":["352004240_A_Survey_on_Domination_in_Vague_Graphs_with_Application_in_Transferring_Cancer_Patients_between_Countries","346993824_A_Study_on_Domination_in_Vague_Incidence_Graph_and_Its_Application_in_Medical_Sciences","345710088_Certain_Concepts_of_Vague_Graphs_With_Applications_to_Medical_Diagnosis","345484775_Certain_Properties_of_Vague_Graphs_with_a_Novel_Application","345400317_Vague_Graph_Structure_with_Application_in_Medical_Diagnosis","343309796_New_Concepts_in_Intuitionistic_Fuzzy_Graph_with_Application_in_Water_Supplier_Systems","326965390_Energy_of_Pythagorean_Fuzzy_Graphs_with_Applications","345677167_Fundamentals_of_Domination_in_Graphs","325314184_New_Concepts_of_Product_Vague_Graphs_with_Applications","323758592_Vulnerability_and_Government_Response_to_Human_Trafficking_Vague_Fuzzy_Incidence_Graphs"]}
