{"id":"262017389_The_Experience_of_Three_Flipped_Classrooms_in_an_Urban_University_An_Exploration_of_Design_Principles","abstract":"As a response to the call for technology enhanced, student-centered learning environments, the flipped classroom approach has drawn much attention from both the research and practice communities. Despite over fifteen years of flipped classroom implementation, design principles have been minimally elaborated upon in relation to diverse disciplinary contexts. Focusing on this gap, we engaged in a mixed methods study that examined three instances of the flipped classroom across unique disciplines and to extract specific design principles. Three instructors and 115 students enrolled in three separate classes in fall 2012 participated in the study. Building upon the Revised Community of Inquiry Framework, we developed a flipped classroom design framework and identified nine design principles.","authors":["Min Kyu Kim","So Mi Kim","Otto Khera","Joan Getman"],"meta":["July 2014The Internet and Higher Education 22","DOI:10.1016/j.iheduc.2014.04.003"],"references":["317953505_Situated_learning_Legitimate_peripheral_participation","313075408_Organizational_learning_and_communities-of-practice_Toward_a_unified_view_of_working_learning_and_innovation","303170761_The_classroom_flip_Using_Web_course_management_tools_to_become_the_guide_on_the_side","294692591_Student-centered_learning_and_interactive_multimedia_Status_issues_and_implications","285712656_Next-generation_educational_technology_versus_the_lecture","285683322_Upside_down_and_inside_out_Flip_your_classroom_to_improve_student_learning","280758090_Motivational_and_Self-Regulated_Learning_Components_of_Classroom_Academic_Performance","279649032_Providing_Real_World_Experience_for_High_School_Teachers_and_Students","277877704_Introduction_to_Flipping_the_College_Classroom","269848305_What_is_Personalization"]}
