{"id":"326524077_Design_and_Analysis_for_Uncertain_Repetitive_Control_Systems_With_Unknown_Disturbances","abstract":"In this paper, the periodic tracking problem is considered for a class of continuous system with uncertainty, time-varying delay, and unknown bounded external disturbances. To be precise, in order to attenuate the unknown disturbance effectively, the equivalent-input-disturbance (EID) approach is incorporated into the developed algorithm. Then, the sufficient conditions that guarantee the asymptotic tracking performance of the system understudy are established based on the Lyapunov stability theorem. More precisely, Schur complement and free-weighting matrix approach are utilized to derive the main results. Moreover, the proposed EID-based modified repetitive controller (MRC) not only rejects the unknown external disturbance but also deals with the dead zone effect. Finally, two simulation examples are presented to verify the superiority of the proposed EID-based repetitive controller over the conventional repetitive controller.","authors":["Sakthivel
