{"id":"228799496_A_World_of_Difference_a_Global_Survey_of_University_League_Tables","abstract":"The Educational Policy Institute, Inc. (EPI) is a non-partisan, non-governmental organization dedicated to policy-based research on educational opportunity for all students. With offices in Washington, DC, Toronto, ON, and Melbourne, Australia, EPI is a collective association of researchers and policy analysts from around the world dedicated to the mission of enhancing our knowledge of critical barriers facing students and families throughout the educational pipeline. In addition, EPI has developed extensive partnerships and collaborative arrangements with other leading research and educational organizations, further supporting our mission and ability to conduct policy-relevant research for practical use. The mission of EPI is to expand educational opportunity for low-income and other historically-underrepresented students through high-level research and analysis. By providing educational leaders and policymakers with the information required to make prudent programmatic and policy decisions, we believe that the doors of opportunity can be further opened for all students, resulting in an increase in the number of students prepared for, enrolled in, and completing postsecondary education.","authors":["Alex Usher","Massimo Savino"],"meta":["February 2006"],"references":["237446440_The_International_Standing_of_Australian_Universities","225861416_Measuring_quality_A_comparison_of_US_News_rankings_and_NSSE_benchmarks","263491304_Summary_Report_of_the_Invitational_Roundtable_on_Statistical_Indicators_for_the_Quality_Assessment_of_HigherTertiary_Education_Institutions_Ranking_and_League_Table_Methodologies","248961220_Accreditation_and_Quality_Assurance_in_Europe","240523710_The_Use_of_University_Rankings_in_the_United_Kingdom","240252116_Some_Guidelines_for_Academic_Quality_Rankings","237690674_Is_There_a_Global_Definition_of_Academic_Quality_A_Cross-National_Analysis_of_University_Ranking_Systems","233446807_Public_and_Private_Higher_Education_Institutions--Joint_or_Separate_Evaluation_and_Ranking_The_Polish_Perspective","233299224_Perspektywy_--Ten_Years_of_Rankings","233285870_The_TimesThe_Times_Higher_Education_Supplement_--League_Tables_in_Britain_An_Insider's_View","232859543_On_the_Ranking_of_Higher_Education_Institutions","2876095_The_Four_Literatures_Of_Social_Science"]}
