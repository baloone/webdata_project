{"id":"335827055_Ranking_of_Heart_Hospitals_Using_Cross-Efficiency_and_Two-stage_DEA","abstract":"Heart patients shows several symptoms and it is rigid to point them. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) delivers a comparative efficiency degree for each decision-making units (DMUs) with several inputs and outputs. Evaluating of hospitals is one of the major applications in DEA. In current study, CCR input oriented (CCRIO) model is applied. A new-two stage DEA model and a cross-efficiency are considered for efficiency evaluation and ranking of DMUs at the same periods. The data covers a six-year span from 2011 to 2016 for 12 local heart hospitals. The system was implemented in Banxia Frontier Analyst software and average efficiency scores, efficient DMUs contribution, inefficient DMUs reference, number of efficient DMUs, number of inefficient DMUs, target and potential improvement are compared. The sixth, the tenth and the eleventh hospitals with five high efficient DMUs (100%) among six DMUs are introduced as the highest performance hospitals and second period with an average efficiency of 85.07% is presented by means of the best presentation period.","authors":["Mirpouya Mirmozaffari","Alireza Alinezhad"],"meta":["October 2017","Conference: 7th International Conference on Computer and Knowledge Engineering (ICCKE 2017), October 26-27 2017, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad"],"references":["317952833_Data_Mining_Apriori_Algorithm_for_Heart_Disease_Prediction","317952814_Data_Mining_Classification_Algorithms_for_Heart_Disease_Prediction","317952592_Heart_Disease_Prediction_with_Data_Mining_Clustering_Algorithms","277009892_An_efficiency_analysis_of_the_clinical_departments_of_a_public_hospital_in_Eskisehir_by_using_DEA","276900623_Measuring_Technical_Efficiency_of_Faith_Based_Hospitals_in_Tanzania_An_application_of_Data_Envelopment_Analysis_DEA","255952348_Estimation_of_the_efficiency_of_Japanese_hospitals_using_a_dynamic_and_network_data_envelopment_analysis_model","288971574_Global_atlas_on_cardiovascular_disease_prevention_and_control_World_Health_Organization","273124901_A_comprehensive_review_of_emergency_department_simulation_applications_for_normal_and_disaster_conditions","271850060_The_simulation_model_of_teleradiology_in_telemedicine_project","262191521_Patient_Flow_Modelling_and_Performance_Analysis_of_Healthcare_Delivery_Processes_in_Hospitals_A_Review_and_Reflections"]}
