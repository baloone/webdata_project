{"id":"319770557_Finding_paths_through_the_world's_photos","abstract":"When a scene is photographed many times by different people, the viewpoints often cluster along certain paths. These paths are largely specific to the scene being photographed, and follow interesting regions and viewpoints. We seek to discover a range of such paths and turn them into controls for image-based rendering. Our approach takes as input a large set of community or personal photos, reconstructs camera viewpoints, and automatically computes orbits, panoramas, canonical views, and optimal paths between views. The scene can then be interactively browsed in 3D using these controls or with six degree-of-freedom free-viewpoint control. As the user browses the scene, nearby views are continuously selected and transformed, using control-adaptive reprojection techniques.","authors":["Noah Snavely","Rahul Garg","Steven M Seitz","Richard Szeliski"],"meta":["August 2008ACM Transactions on Graphics 27(3):1-11","DOI:10.1145/1360612.1360614"],"references":["221589375_BHierarchical_photo_organization_using_geo-relevance","220792057_Guided_Navigation_of_Virtual_Environments","220720327_Plenoptic_Stitching_A_Scalable_Method_for_Reconstructing_3D_Interactive_Walkthroughs","220660226_Visual_Modeling_with_a_Hand-Held_Camera","38412938_Unstructured_Lumigraph_Rendering","3209179_Image-based_interactive_exploration_of_real-world_environments","2912574_View_Interpolation_for_Image_Synthesis","2908246_The_Lumigraph","2314467_View_Morphing","313557209_Random_sample_consensus_A_paradigm_for_model_fitting_applications_to_image_analysis_and_automated_cartography","269033778_Photo_tourism","234832545_Movie-maps_an_application_of_the_optical_videodisc_to_computer_graphics_In_SIGGRAPH'80The_ACM_SIGGRAPH_Computer_Graphics_ACM_New_York_143_32-42","234804049_A_head-mounted_three_dimensional_display","220720306_Plenoptic_Modeling_An_Image-Based_Rendering_System","200038910_Distinctive_Image_Features_from_Scale-Invariant_Keypoints","3410961_VideoPlus_A_method_for_capturing_the_structure_and_appearance_of_immersive_environments","3191678_Bookstein_FL_Principal_Warps_Thin-Plate_Splines_and_the_Decomposition_of_Deformations_IEEE_Trans_Pattern_Anal_Mach_Intell_11_567-585","2876471_Light_Field_Rendering","2523921_Exploring_3D_Navigation_Combining_Speed-coupled_Flying_with_Orbiting","2508071_QuickTime_VR_-_An_Image-Based_Approach_to_Virtual_Environment_Navigation","2506853_Rendering_with_Concentric_Mosaics","2386241_Modeling_and_Rendering_Architecture_from_Photographs_A_Hybrid_Geometry-_and_Image-Based_Approach"]}
