{"id":"287390345_3D_Tree_Skeletonization_from_Multiple_Images_Based_on_PyrLK_Optical_Flow","abstract":"3D tree models are widely applied to construct large-scale virtual scenes. However, converting real trees into computer representation faces two main problems. One is the low quality of reconstructed point cloud. The other is that the skeletonization produces inaccurate results due to the complex structure of trees. We propose a novel pipeline to reconstruct automatically accurate 3D tree skeletons from sequential tree images. It involves three steps: (1) Pre-processing: an optical flow based feature-matching algorithm is proposed to acquire high-quality point clouds. (2) Shape-based parallel skeletonization: tree shape is taken into consideration to detect specific structure features of trees during parallel flooding. (3) Post-processing: an L-System extraction algorithm is applied on the skeletons and the lightweight representation is obtained to meet various requirements. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through experiments.","authors":["Dejia Zhang","Ning Xie","Shuang Liang","Jinyuan Jia"],"meta":["December 2015Pattern Recognition Letters 76","DOI:10.1016/j.patrec.2015.11.007"],"references":["235765743_TreeSketch_Interactive_Procedural_Modeling_of_Trees_on_a_Tablet","226911507_SkelTre_Robust_skeleton_extraction_from_imperfect_point_clouds","222815116_Constructing_a_3D_trunk_model_from_two_images","222686034_CAMPINO_-_A_skeletonization_method_for_point_cloud_processing","221247667_Creation_of_Tree_Models_from_Freehand_Sketches_by_Building_3D_Skeleton_Point_Cloud","220720547_Animation_of_plant_development","220465036_Feature_tracking_and_matching_in_video_using_programmable_graphics_hardware","220183914_Single_Image_Tree_Modeling","220183760_Image-based_plant_modeling","220067305_Image-based_tree_modeling_from_a_few_images_with_very_narrow_viewing_range","216338870_Image-based_lightweight_tree_modeling","30012950_Sketch-Based_Tree_Modeling_Using_Markov_Random_Field","3208740_Interactive_Modeling_of_Plants","262323674_Image-based_Reconstruction_and_Synthesis_of_Dense_Foliage","262295298_L-1-Medial_Skeleton_of_Point_Cloud","222477295_A_3D_6-subiteration_thinning_algorithm_for_extracting_medial_lines","222452723_A_new_shape_preserving_parallel_thinning_algorithm_for_3D_digital_images","221364160_Robust_Centerline_Extraction_Framework_Using_Level_Sets","220839262_1-2-tree_Semantic_Modeling_and_Editing_of_Trees","220600271_Computing_skeletons_in_three_dimensions","200038910_Distinctive_Image_Features_from_Scale-Invariant_Keypoints","29647633_Discrete_bisector_function_and_Euclidean_skeleton_in_2D_and_3D","17527103_Mathematical_models_for_cellular_interactions_in_development_I_Filaments_with_one-sided_inputs"]}
