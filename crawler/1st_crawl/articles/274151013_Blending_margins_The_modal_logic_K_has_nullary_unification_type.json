{"id":"274151013_Blending_margins_The_modal_logic_K_has_nullary_unification_type","abstract":"We investigate properties of the formula p → □p in the basic modal logic K. We show that K satisfies an infinitary weaker variant of the rule of margins ϕ → □ϕ/ϕ, ¬ϕ, and as a consequence, we obtain various negative results about admissibility and unification in K. We describe a complete set of unifiers (i.e. substitutions making the formula provable) of p → □p, and use it to establish that K has the worst possible unification type: nullary. In well-behaved transitive modal logics, admissibility and unification\ncan be analysed in terms of projective formulas, introduced by Ghilardi; in particular, projective formulas coincide for these\nlogics with formulas that are admissibly saturated (i.e. derive all their multiple-conclusion admissible consequences) or\nexact (i.e. axiomatize a theory of a substitution). In contrast, we show that in K, the formula p → □p is admissibly saturated, but neither projective nor exact. All our results for K also apply to the basic description logic ALC ALC.","authors":["Emil Jerabek"],"meta":["January 2013Journal of Logic and Computation 25(5)","DOI:10.1093/logcom/ext055"],"references":["279430309_Unification_Theory","221667108_Simplicial_geometry_of_unital_lattice-ordered_abelian_groups","220245362_Unification_in_modal_and_description_logics","45923144_Unification_in_the_Description_Logic_EL","38355463_An_alternative_rule_of_disjunction_in_modal_logic","38355320_Some_Admissible_Rules_in_Nonnormal_Modal_Logics","2580899_On_the_Admissible_Rules_of_Intuitionistic_Propositional_Logic","1959894_Undecidability_of_the_unification_and_admissibility_problems_for_modal_and_description_logics","344486660_Modal_Logic","267015861_Transparent_unifiers_in_modal_logics_with_self-conjugate_operators","266722563_Formulas_of_One_Propositional_Variable_in_Intuitionistic_Arithmetic","238501968_Chapter_3_Description_Logics","228923321_Duality_projectivity_and_unification_in_Lukasiewicz_logic_and_MV-algebras","226939248_Non-genuine_MacIntosh_logics","222709128_Unification_of_Concept_Terms_in_Description_Logics","222199248_Best_solving_modal_equations","220387955_Bases_of_Admissible_Rules_of_Lukasiewicz_Logic","38384120_Unification_in_Intuitionistic_Logic","31211411_Admissible_Rules_of_Modal_Logics"]}
