{"id":"335784485_Raspberry_Pi-based_HIL_simulators_for_control_education","abstract":"Excluding hands-on experience with physical plants from control education is tempting in many aspects, but at the same time it is very dangerous. This paper explains why and recommends a compromise between demanding maintenance of physical plants for students to control and relying on pure numeric simulations within the whole curriculum. The golden mean might be the use of real-time simulators with physical inputs and outputs, i.e. hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulators. Three examples of HIL simulators are presented, covering a coupled tanks model, a quarter-car model and a nuclear reactor model.","authors":["J.
