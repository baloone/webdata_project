{"id":"323501137_Dietary_Fiber_Intake_and_Type_2_Diabetes_Mellitus_An_Umbrella_Review_of_Meta-analyses","abstract":"Objective\nThe purpose of this study was to review previously published meta-analyses on the effectiveness of dietary fiber on type 2 diabetes.\n\nMethods\nAn umbrella review of all published meta-analyses was performed. A PubMed search from January 1, 1980, to April 30, 2017, was conducted using the following search strategy: (fiber OR glucan OR psyllium) AND (meta-analysis OR systematic review). Only English-language publications that provided quantitative statistical analysis on type 2 diabetes, fasting blood glucose concentrations, or glycosylated hemoglobin were retrieved.\n\nResults\nSixteen meta-analyses were retrieved for inclusion in this umbrella review. In the meta-analyses comparing highest versus lowest dietary fiber intake, there was a statistically significant reduction in the relative risk (RR) of type 2 diabetes (RR = 0.81-0.85), with the greatest benefit coming from cereal fibers (RR = 0.67-0.87). However, statistically significant heterogeneity was observed in all of these meta-analyses. In the meta-analyses of supplementation studies using β-glucan or psyllium fibers on type 2 diabetic participants, statistically significant reductions were identified in both fasting blood glucose concentrations and glycosylated hemoglobin percentages.\n\nConclusion\nThis review suggests that those consuming the highest amounts of dietary fiber, especially cereal fiber, may benefit from a reduction in the incidence of developing type 2 diabetes. There also appears to be a small reduction in fasting blood glucose concentration, as well as a small reduction in glycosylated hemoglobin percentage for individuals with type 2 diabetes who add β-glucan or psyllium to their daily dietary intake.","authors":["Marc McRae"],"meta":["March 2018Journal of Chiropractic Medicine 17(1):44-53","DOI:10.1016/j.jcm.2017.11.002"],"references":["312108292_Interventions_to_lower_the_glycemic_response_to_carbohydrate_foods_with_a_low-viscosity_fiber_resistant_maltodextrin_meta-analysis_of_randomized_controlled_trials","308120953_Effect_of_inulin-type_fructans_on_blood_lipid_profile_and_glucose_level_a_systematic_review_and_meta-analysis_of_randomized_controlled_trials","301535375_Healthy_Eating_Index-2010_and_food_groups_consumed_by_US_adults_who_meet_or_exceed_fiber_intake_recommendations_NHANES_2001-2010","291391328_Difference_between_Oats_and_Beta-Glucan_Extracts_Intake_in_Management_of_HbA1c_Fasting_Glucose_and_Insulin_Sensitivity_a_Meta-Analysis_of_Randomized_Controlled_Trials","290511498_Effect_of_Oat_b-Glucan_Intake_on_Glycaemic_Control_and_Insulin_Sensitivity_of_Diabetic_Patients_A_Meta-Analysis_of_Randomized_Controlled_Trials","287403077_The_Metabolic_Effects_of_Oats_Intake_in_Patients_with_Type_2_Diabetes_A_Systematic_Review_and_Meta-Analysis","281751544_Dietary_fibre_and_incidence_of_type_2_diabetes_in_eight_European_countries_The_EPIC-InterAct_Study_and_a_meta-analysis_of_prospective_studies","281679723_Summarizing_systematic_reviews_Methodological_development_conduct_and_reporting_of_an_umbrella_review_approach","283728260_Psyllium_fiber_improves_glycemic_control_proportional_to_loss_of_glycemic_control_A_meta-analysis_of_data_in_euglycemic_subjects_patients_at_risk_of_type_2_diabetes_mellitus_and_patients_being_treated","283225646_Position_of_the_Academy_of_Nutrition_and_Dietetics_Health_Implications_of_Dietary_Fiber"]}
