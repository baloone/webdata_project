{"id":"245331557_An_ISM_approach_for_modelling_the_enablers_of_flexible_manufacturing_system_The_case_for_India","abstract":"The volatile condition of today's market is forcing the manufacturing managers to adapt the flexible manufacturing systems (FMS) to meet the challenges imposed by international competition, ever changing customer demands, rapid delivery to market and advancement in technology. There are certain enablers, which help in the implementation of FMS or in the transition process from traditional manufacturing systems to FMS. The utmost need is to analyse the behaviour of these enablers for their effective utilization in the implementation of FMS. The main objective of this paper is to understand the mutual interaction of these enablers and identify the ‘driving enablers’ (i.e. which influence the other enablers) and the ‘dependent enablers’ (i.e. which are influenced by others). In the present work, these enablers have been identified through the literature, their ranking is done by a questionnaire-based survey and interpretive structural modelling (ISM) approach has been utilized in analysing their mutual interaction. An ISM model has been prepared to identify some key enablers and their managerial implications in the implementation of FMS.","authors":["Tilak Raj","R.
