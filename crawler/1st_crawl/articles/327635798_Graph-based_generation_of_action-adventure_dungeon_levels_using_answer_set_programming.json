{"id":"327635798_Graph-based_generation_of_action-adventure_dungeon_levels_using_answer_set_programming","abstract":"The construction of dungeons in typical action-adventure computer games entails composing a complex arrangement of structural and temporal dependencies. It is not simple to generate dungeons with correct lock-and-key structures. In this paper we sketch a controllable approach to building graph-based models of acyclic dungeon levels via declarative constraint solving, that is capable of satisfying a range of hard gameplay and design constraints. We use a quantitative expressive range analysis to characterise the initial output of the system, present an example of the degree to which the output may be altered, and show a comparison with an alternate approach.","authors":["Thomas Smith","Julian Padget","Andrew Vidler"],"meta":["August 2018","DOI:10.1145/3235765.3235817","Conference: the 13th International Conference"],"references":["308871748_Procedural_level_generation_with_answer_set_programming_for_general_Video_Game_playing","303872046_cornerpy_Scatterplot_matrices_in_Python","288320122_Designing_procedurally_generated_levels","260800341_Procedural_Generation_of_Dungeons","260475413_A_Comparative_Evaluation_of_Procedural_Level_Generators_in_the_Mario_AI_Framework","254463835_Evolving_dungeon_crawler_levels_with_relative_placement","228411962_Analyzing_the_expressive_range_of_a_level_generator","319370602_Procedural_zelda_a_PCG_environment_for_player_experience_research","319370558_Towards_pattern-based_mixed-initiative_dungeon_generation","309279826_ASP_with_Applications_to_Mazes_and_Levels","288445208_A_logical_approach_to_building_dungeons_Answer_set_programming_for_hierarchical_procedural_content_generation_in_roguelike_games","262424389_A_mixed-initiative_tool_for_designing_level_progressions_in_games","262318673_Anza_island_Novel_gameplay_using_ASP","254006023_A_case_study_of_expressively_constrainable_level_design_automation_tools_for_a_puzzle_game","228994305_Adventures_in_level_design_Generating_missions_and_spaces_for_action_adventure_games","228747742_Level_design_as_model_transformation_A_strategy_for_automated_content_generation","224240207_Answer_Set_Programming_for_Procedural_Content_Generation_A_Design_Space_Approach"]}
