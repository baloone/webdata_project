{"id":"263244782_Cloud_Storage_Services_in_Higher_Education_-_Results_of_a_Preliminary_Study_in_the_Context_of_the_SyncShare-Project_in_Germany","abstract":"In recent years, a growing number of institutions in higher education is in progress to adopt cloud storage services. This paper describes the Sync&Share NRW-project in North Rhine-Westphalia (Germany) with a target audience of up to 500,000 users and presents the main results of a preliminary large-scale survey at the University of Muenster with more than 3,000 participants. The results of the analysis indicates a very high demand for an on-premise cloud service solution in German higher education with mobile access, a storage volume comparable to commercial offerings, collaborative features such as simultaneous work on text documents and, above all, high data protection standards.","authors":["Christian Meske","Stefan Stieglitz","Raimund Vogl","Dominik Rudolph"],"meta":["June 2014","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-07482-5_16","Conference: International Conference on Learning and Collaboration Technologies"],"references":["277879752_Cloud_Computing_A_Free_Technology_Option_to_Promote_Collaborative_Learning","259703952_Social_Software_as_an_Instrument_of_CSR","259703813_Designing_a_Large_Scale_Cooperative_SyncShare_Cloud_Storage_Plattform_for_the_Academic_Community_in_Northrhine-Westfalia","259703812_The_Influence_of_Learning_Management_System_Components_on_Learners'_Motivation_in_a_Large-Scale_Social_Learning_Environment","258846992_Perceived_Usefulness_Perceived_Ease_Of_Use_And_User_Accep","312984568_Perceived_usefulness_perceived_ease_and_user_acceptance_of_information_technology","285830747_Cloud_Computing_Benefits_risks_and_recommendations_for_information_security","271589473_The_NIST_definition_of_cloud_computing","262388962_Cloud_computing_for_education_A_new_dawn","258023685_The_NIST_Definition_of_Cloud_Computing_Draft_Recommendations_of_the_National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology"]}
