{"id":"27363203_Applications_of_mathematical_programming_in_graceful_labeling_of_graphs","abstract":"Graceful labeling is one of the best known labeling methods of\ngraphs. Despite the large number of papers published on the\nsubject of graph labeling, there are few particular techniques to\nbe used by researchers to gracefully label graphs. In this paper,\nfirst a new approach based on the mathematical programming \ntechnique is presented to model the graceful labeling problem.\nThen a branching method is developed to solve the problem for\nspecial classes of graphs. Computational results show the\nefficiency of the proposed algorithm for different classes of\ngraphs. One of the interesting results of our model is in the\nclass of trees. The largest tree known to be graceful has at most\n27 vertices but our model can easily solve the graceful labeling\nfor trees with 40 vertices.","authors":["Kourosh Eshghi","Parham Azimi"],"meta":["May 2004Journal of Applied Mathematics 2004(1)","DOI:10.1155/S1110757X04310065"],"references":["244474213_On_certain_valuations_of_the_vertices_of_a_graph","222843108_A_guide_to_the_graph_labeling_zoo","2827653_A_Dynamic_Survey_of_Graph_Labeling","268650150_Decompositions_of_Graphs"]}
