{"id":"8670633_Untangling_the_Concepts_of_Disability_Frailty_and_Comorbidity_Implications_for_Improved_Targeting_and_Care","abstract":"Three terms are commonly used interchangeably to identify vulnerable older adults: comorbidity, or multiple chronic conditions,\nfrailty, and disability. However, in geriatric medicine, there is a growing consensus that these are distinct clinical entities\nthat are causally related. Each, individually, occurs frequently and has high import clinically. This article provides a narrative\nreview of current understanding of the definitions and distinguishing characteristics of each of these conditions, including\ntheir clinical relevance and distinct prevention and therapeutic issues, and how they are related. Review of the current state\nof published knowledge is supplemented by targeted analyses in selected areas where no current published data exists. Overall,\nthe goal of this article is to provide a basis for distinguishing between these three important clinical conditions in older\nadults and showing how use of separate, distinct definitions of each can improve our understanding of the problems affecting\nolder patients and lead to development of improved strategies for diagnosis, care, research, and medical education in this\narea.","authors":["Linda P Fried","Luigi Ferrucci","Jonathan Darer","Jeff Williamson"],"meta":["April 2004The Journals of Gerontology Series A Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences 59(3):255-63","DOI:10.1093/gerona/59.3.M255","SourcePubMed"],"references":["291918856_American_Medical_Association_white_paper_on_elderly_health","308150463_Frailty_and_failure_to_thrive","297290602_Something_about_frailty","286669705_Health_status_assessment_for_elderly_patients_Report_of_the_Society_of_General_Internal_Medicine_Task_Force_on_Health_Assessment","286271015_Committee_on_a_National_Agenda_for_the_Prevention_of_Disabilities_Institute_of_Medicine_A_model_for_disability_and_disability_prevention","285244069_Aging_in_the_eighties_The_prevalence_of_comorbidity_and_association_with_disability","278235262_An_Activist_Health_Minister_In_A_Conservative_Government","274430572_Malacoplakia_Two_case_reports_and_a_comparison_of_treatment_modalities_based_on_a_literature_review","271279528_Predicting_the_Risk_of_Mobility_Difficulty_in_Older_Women_With_Screening_Nomograms","271148511_Loss_of_'complexity'_and_aging_Potential_applications_of_fractals_and_chaos_theory_to_senescence"]}
