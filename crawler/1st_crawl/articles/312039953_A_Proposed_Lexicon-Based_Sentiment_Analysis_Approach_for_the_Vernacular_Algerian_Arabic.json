{"id":"312039953_A_Proposed_Lexicon-Based_Sentiment_Analysis_Approach_for_the_Vernacular_Algerian_Arabic","abstract":". Nowadays, sentiment analysis research is widely applied in a variety of applications such as marketing and politics. Several studies on the Arabic sentiment analysis have been carried out in recent years. These studies mainly focus on Modern Standard Arabic among which few studies have investigated the case of Arab dialects, in this case, Egyptian, Jordanian, and Khaliji. In this paper, we propose a new lexicon-based sentiment analysis approach to address the specific aspects of the vernacular Algerian Arabic fully utilized in social networks. A manually annotated dataset and three Algerian Arabic lexicons have been created to explore the different phases of our approach.","authors":["Mhamed Mataoui","Omar Zelmati","Madiha Boumechache"],"meta":["April 2016Research in Computing Science 110(Advances in Opinion Mining, Social Network Analysis, and Authorship Attribution):55-70","DOI:10.13053/rcs-110-1-5","Project: Sentiment Analysis for Arabic Web content"],"references":["322956319_Multi-lingual_sentiment_analysis_of_financial_news_streams","305489865_Tharwa_A_Large_Scale_Dialectal_Arabic-Standard_Arabic-English_Lexicon","304579281_Sentiment_Analysis_on_Twitter","301449013_A_Conventional_Orthography_for_Algerian_Arabic","292607570_A_Prototype_for_a_Standard_Arabic_Sentiment_Analysis_Corpus","288630036_A_Prototype_for_a_Standard_Arabic_Sentiment_Analysis_Corpus","276296759_Sentiment_Analysis_For_Modern_Standard_Arabic_And_Colloquial","271852211_Towards_Improving_the_Lexicon-Based_Approach_for_Arabic_Sentiment_Analysis","271550479_Sentiment_Analysis_in_Arabic_tweets","301390169_Automatic_identification_of_arabic_dialects_in_social_media"]}
