{"id":"323663936_Efficient_approximations_of_RNA_kinetics_landscape_using_non-redundant_sampling","abstract":"Motivation: \nKinetics is key to understand many phenomena involving RNAs, such as co-transcriptional folding and riboswitches. Exact out-of-equilibrium studies induce extreme computational demands, leading state-of-the-art methods to rely on approximated kinetics landscapes, obtained using sampling strategies that strive to generate the key landmarks of the landscape topology. However, such methods are impeded by a large level of redundancy within sampled sets. Such a redundancy is uninformative, and obfuscates important intermediate states, leading to an incomplete vision of RNA dynamics.\n\nResults: \nWe introduce RNANR, a new set of algorithms for the exploration of RNA kinetics landscapes at the secondary structure level. RNANR considers locally optimal structures, a reduced set of RNA conformations, in order to focus its sampling on basins in the kinetic landscape. Along with an exhaustive enumeration, RNANR implements a novel non-redundant stochastic sampling, and offers a rich array of structural parameters. Our tests on both real and random RNAs reveal that RNANR allows to generate more unique structures in a given time than its competitors, and allows a deeper exploration of kinetics landscapes.\n\nAvailability and implementation: \nRNANR is freely available at https://project.inria.fr/rnalands/rnanr .\n\nContact: \nyann.ponty@lix.polytechnique.fr.","authors":["Juraj Michálik","Hélène Touzet","Yann Ponty"],"meta":["July 2017Bioinformatics 33(14):i283-i292","DOI:10.1093/bioinformatics/btx269"],"references":["309591177_Cotranscriptional_Folding_of_a_Riboswitch_at_Nucleotide_Resolution","299341719_Using_RNA_as_Molecular_Code_for_Programming_Cellular_Function","281667618_Rfam_120_Updates_to_the_RNA_families_database","275050525_RNA-Puzzles_Round_II_Assessment_of_RNA_structure_prediction_programs_applied_to_three_large_RNA_structures","273700891_RNA_World_research--still_evolving","262424726_Impact_of_the_Energy_Model_on_the_Complexity_of_RNA_Folding_with_Pseudoknots","260950912_Basin_Hopping_Graph_A_computational_framework_to_characterize_RNA_folding_landscapes","303750599_Rfam_120_Updates_to_the_RNA_families_database","282361028_Selective_2'-hydroxyl_acylation_analyzed_by_primer_extension_and_mutational_profiling_SHAPE-MaP_for_direct_versatile_and_accurate_RNA_structure_analysis","273787383_Thermodynamic_and_Kinetic_Folding_of_Riboswitches"]}
