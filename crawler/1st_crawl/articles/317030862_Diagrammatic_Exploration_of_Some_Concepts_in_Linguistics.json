{"id":"317030862_Diagrammatic_Exploration_of_Some_Concepts_in_Linguistics","abstract":"This paper aims to strengthen the relationship between the fields of computer science and linguistics, as they share common problems, especially in the area of natural language understanding. The paper explores some issues in linguistics, including the notion of telic and atelic predicates, in an attempt to understand and enhance knowledge about natural language. A diagrammatic tool for computer science is utilized to comprehend and interpret linguistics concepts. The resulting representation is an example of its use as an apparatus for clarifying linguistics writings for computer scientists.","authors":["Sabah Al-Fedaghi"],"meta":["May 2017International Journal of Computer Science and Information Security, 15(5)"],"references":["316477172_Modeling_Events_as_Machines","309655956_Conceptual_Modeling_in_Simulation_A_Representation_that_Assimilates_Events","315729085_Securing_the_Security_System","314116090_Context-Aware_Software_Systems_Toward_a_Diagrammatic_Modeling_Foundation","313767119_Flow-Base_provenance","272816243_Verbs_and_Times","239665783_The_Origins_of_Telicity","230875985_Frames_and_the_Semantics_of_Understanding","230561971_Temporal_representation_and_reasoning_in_Artificial_Intelligence_A_review","221102501_The_Design_of_a_Computer_Language_for_Linguistic_Information"]}
