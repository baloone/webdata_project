In both schemes, iteration functionsf\n\nm\n(z) are constructed so that sequencesz\n\nn+1\n=f\n\nm\n(z\n\nn\n) converge locally to a rootz\n* ofg(z) asO(|z\n\nn\n−z\n*|m). It is well known that attractive cycles, other than the zerosz\n*, may exist for Newton's method (m=2). Asm increases, the iteration functions add extraneous fixed points and cycles. Whether attractive or repulsive, they affect the Julia set basin boundaries. The König functionsK\n\nm\n(z) appear to minimize such perturbations. In the case of two roots, e.g.g(z)=z\n2−1, Cayley's classical result for the basins of attraction of Newton's method is extended for allK\n\nm\n(z). The existence of chaotic {z\n\nn\n} sequences is also demonstrated for these iteration methods.","authors":["Edward Vrscay","William Gilbert"],"meta":["January 1988Numerische Mathematik 52(1):1-16","DOI:10.1007/BF01401018"],"references":["322946829_Newton's_Method_Circle_Maps_and_Chaotic_Motion","303341424_The_construction_of_rational_iterating_functions","284290334_Application_of_the_Newton-Fourier_method_to_an_imaginary_root_of_an_equation","270066334_Principles_of_Numerical_Analysis","268704800_Principles_of_numerical_analysis_2nd_corr_ed","265897925_Memoire_sur_I'iteration_des_fonctions_rationelles","265670591_An_Introduction_To_Chaotic_Dynamics_Systems","265562149_The_Geometry_of_Fractal_Sets","265457507_On_the_Dynamics_of_Polynomial-like_Mappings","265434347_Uber_die_Divergenzpunkte_des_Newtonschen_Verfahrens_zur_Bestimmung_von_Wurzeln_algebraischer_Gleichungen_II"]}
