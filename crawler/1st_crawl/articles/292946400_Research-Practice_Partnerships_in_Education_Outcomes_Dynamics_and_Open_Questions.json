{"id":"292946400_Research-Practice_Partnerships_in_Education_Outcomes_Dynamics_and_Open_Questions","abstract":"Policymakers, funders, and researchers today view research–practice partnerships (RPPs) as a promising approach for expanding the role of research in improving educational practice. Although studies in other fields provide evidence of the potential for RPPs, studies in education are few. This article provides a review of available evidence of the outcomes and dynamics of RPPs in education and related fields. It then outlines a research agenda for the study of RPPs that can guide funders’ investments and help developing partnerships succeed.","authors":["Cynthia Coburn","William R.
