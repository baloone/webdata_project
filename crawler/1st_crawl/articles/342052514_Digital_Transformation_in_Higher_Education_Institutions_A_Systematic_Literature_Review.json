{"id":"342052514_Digital_Transformation_in_Higher_Education_Institutions_A_Systematic_Literature_Review","abstract":"Higher education institutions (HEIs) have been permeated by the technological advancement that the Industrial Revolution 4.0 brings with it, and forces institutions to deal with a digital transformation in all dimensions. Applying the approaches of digital transformation to the HEI domain is an emerging field that has aroused interest during the recent past, as they allow us to describe the complex relationships between actors in a technologically supported education domain. The objective of this paper is to summarize the distinctive characteristics of the digital transformation (DT) implementation process that have taken place in HEIs. The Kitchenham protocol was conducted by authors to answer the research questions and selection criteria to retrieve the eligible papers. Nineteen papers (1980-2019) were identified in the literature as relevant and consequently analyzed in detail. The main findings show that it is indeed an emerging field, none of the found DT in HEI proposals have been developed in a holistic dimension. This situation calls for further research efforts on how HEIs can understand DT and face the current requirements that the fourth industrial revolution forced.","authors":["Lina Mar√≠a","Castro Benavides","Johnny Alexander","Tamayo Arias"],"meta":["June 2020Sensors 20(11):3291","DOI:10.3390/s20113291"],"references":["333817824_SELF-MANAGED_TEAMS_AS_A_KEY_TO_UNLOCKING_DIGITAL_TRANSFORMATION_IN_BUSINESS_MANAGEMENT","331404935_DIGITAL_TRANSFORMATION_OF_UNIVERSITY_EDUCATION_IN_UKRAINE_TRAJECTORIES_OF_DEVELOPMENT_IN_THE_CONDITIONS_OF_NEW_TECHNOLOGICAL_AND_ECONOMIC_ORDER","330601808_Challenges_of_Digital_Transformation_in_Higher_Education_Institutions_A_brief_discussion","330224833_A_Conceptual_Model_of_Digital_Transformation_Openergy_and_theCase_Study_of_Universidad_Nacional_de_Colombia","329890566_Digital_transformation_in_German_higher_education_student_and_teacher_perceptions_and_usage_of_digital_media","341290422_An_Education_Literature_Review_on_Digitization_Digitalization_Datafication_and_Digital_Transformation","331606161_Intelligent_Educational_Dual_Architecture_for_University_Digital_Transformation","331402039_A_Teaching_Concept_Towards_Digitalization_at_the_LEAD_Factory_of_Graz_University_of_Technology","330687791_Entrepreneurial_mindset_as_a_driver_for_digital_transformation_-_a_novel_educational_approach_from_University-Industry_Interactions","330303796_Challenges_of_Professional_Adaptation_of_University_Graduates_in_Response_to_the_Economics'_Digital_Transformation"]}
