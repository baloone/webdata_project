{"id":"4365745_Medical_Image_Processing_by_Denoising_and_Contour_Extraction","abstract":"This paper proposes a new algorithm of medical image denoising and contour extraction that can be used in image processing such as medical image reconstruction, image enhancement, image smoothing, feature extraction and image analysis. The algorithm consists of two parts. First, combining median filtering with wavelet transform to enhance and denoise image. Second, Canny edge detection and contour tracing are repeatedly applied to extract the continuous contour lines of image. The method is validated through experiments on real images. The results show that the algorithm achieves good effects, can deals with low quality or marginal vague images which have high spatial redundancy, low contrast and biggish noise, and has a potential of certain practical use.","authors":["Yu Wang","Jinjin Zheng","Hongjun Zhou","Lianguan Shen"],"meta":["July 2008","DOI:10.1109/ICINFA.2008.4608073","SourceIEEE Xplore","Conference: Information and Automation, 2008.
