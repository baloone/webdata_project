{"id":"221660734_A_De_Bruijn-Erdos_Theorem_for_Chordal_Graphs","abstract":"A special case of a combinatorial theorem of De Bruijn and Erdos asserts that\nevery noncollinear set of n points in the plane determines at least n distinct\nlines. Chen and Chvatal suggested a possible generalization of this assertion\nin metric spaces with appropriately defined lines. We prove this generalization\nin all metric spaces induced by connected chordal graphs.","authors":["Laurent Beaudou","Adrian Bondy","Xiaomin Chen","Ehsan Chiniforooshan"],"meta":["January 2012The Electronic Journal of Combinatorics 22(1)","DOI:10.37236/3527","SourcearXiv"],"references":["247152244_Introduction_to_Geometry","244444916_Geometry_of_Geodesics","238765684_Theory_and_Applications_of_Distance_Geometry","237128705_A_Combinatorial_Problem","225238362_Unterschungen_uber_Allgemeine_Metrik","225125495_On_rigid_circuit_graphs","220570058_Problems_related_to_a_de_Bruijn-Erdos_theorem","220200530_A_de_Bruijn_-_Erdos_theorem_and_metric_spaces","2922765_The_Sylvester-Chvatal_Theorem","2524436_Sylvester-Gallai_Theorem_and_Metric_Betweenness"]}
