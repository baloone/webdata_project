{"id":"278413824_On_Expansion_and_Topological_Overlap","abstract":"We present a detailed and easily accessible proof of Gromov's\n\\emph{Topological Overlap Theorem}: Let $X$ is a finite simplicial complex or,\nmore generally, a finite polyhedral cell complex of dimension $\\dim X=d$.\nInformally, the theorem states that if $X$ has sufficiently strong\n\\emph{higher-dimensional expansion properties} (which generalize edge expansion\nof graphs and are terms of cellular cochains of $X$) then $X$ has the following\n\\emph{topological overlap property}: for every continuous map $X \\rightarrow\nR^d$ there exists a point $p\\in R^d$ whose preimage meets a positive fraction\n$\\mu>0$ of the $d$-cells of $X$. More generally, the conclusion holds if $R^d$\nis replaced by any $d$-dimensional piecewise-linear (PL) manifold $M$, with a\nconstant $\\mu$ that depends only on $d$ and on the expansion properties of $X$,\nbut not on $M$.","authors":["Dominic Dotterrer","Tali Kaufman","Uli Wagner"],"meta":["August 2018Geometriae Dedicata 195(2â€“3)","DOI:10.1007/s10711-017-0291-4","SourcearXiv"],"references":["265386034_Isoperimetric_Inequalities_for_Ramanujan_Complexes_and_Topological_Expanders","257428831_A_Simpler_Proof_of_the_Boros-Furedi-Barany-Pach-Gromov_Theorem","312821154_A_Few_Snapshots_from_the_Work_of_Mikhail_Gromov","282639642_Systolic_Expanders_of_Every_Dimension","281053607_Introduction_to_Piecewise-Linear_Topology","280912015_Eliminating_Higher-Multiplicity_Intersections_I_A_Whitney_Trick_for_Tverberg-Type_Problems","266434339_Elements_of_combinatorial_and_differential_topology_Transl_from_the_Russian_by_Olga_Sipacheva","265447611_A_generalization_of_Caratheodory's_theorem","262289362_Topological_methods","248284574_Using_the_Borsuk-Ulam_Theorem"]}
