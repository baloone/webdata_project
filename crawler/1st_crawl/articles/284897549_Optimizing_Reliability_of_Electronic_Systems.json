{"id":"284897549_Optimizing_Reliability_of_Electronic_Systems","abstract":"The deterministic optimization of embedded electronic systems does not take uncertainties into account and does not guarantee a reliable design. This chapter provides a probabilistic approach for the design optimization of embedded mechatronic systems. This approach takes into account the inherent nature of uncertainties which are due to insufficient knowledge of the material properties of the materials, the geometric dimensions and the load fluctuations. The rational approach for optimizing embedded systems consists of considering the propagation of uncertainties in multiphysical behavior (electrical, thermal, mechanic, etc.) by using a probabilistic modeling of uncertainties of the input parameters. The reliability-based optimization approach aims to find the best design with a compromise between reducing the objective function (cost, weight, etc.) and ensuring reliability.","authors":["Younes Aoues","A.
