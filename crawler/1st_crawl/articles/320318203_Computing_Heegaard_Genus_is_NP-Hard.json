{"id":"320318203_Computing_Heegaard_Genus_is_NP-Hard","abstract":"We show that Heegaard Genus ≤ g, the problem of deciding whether a triangulated 3-manifold admits a Heegaard splitting of genus less than or equal to g, is NP-hard. The result follows from a quadratic time reduction of the NP-complete problem CNF-SAT to Heegaard Genus ≤g.","authors":["David Bachman","Ryan Derby-Talbot","Eric Sedgwick"],"meta":["October 2017","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-44479-6_3","In book: A Journey Through Discrete Mathematics (pp.59-87)"],"references":["301878836_Some_Conditionally_Hard_Problems_on_Links_and_3-Manifolds","301845428_Finding_Non-orientable_Surfaces_in_3-Manifolds","265458183_The_Classification_of_Heegaard_Splittings_for_Compact_Orient_Able_Surface_S1","260039404_Embeddability_in_the_3-sphere_is_decidable","254212771_0Efficient_Triangulations_of_3-Manifolds","253179089_Sweepouts_of_amalgamated_3-manifolds","246363661_Heegaard_structure_of_negatively_curved_3-manifolds","231971219_Examples_of_tunnel_number_one_knots_which_have_the_property_'1_1_3'","228749269_Closed_essential_surfaces_and_weakly_reducible_Heegaard_splittings_in_manifolds_with_boundary","228115434_The_complexity_of_detecting_taut_angle_structures_on_triangulations","222814023_Heegaard_Splittings_of_Twisted_Torus_Knots","2143188_Classification_of_unknotting_tunnels_for_two_bridge_knots","2126845_Layered-triangulations_of_3-manifolds","2123121_Destabilizing_amalgamated_Heegaard_splittings","2113648_Sphere_recognition_lies_in_NP","1894268_The_Heegaard_structure_of_Dehn_filled_manifolds","314828912_3-manifold_knot_genus_is_NP-complete","312750990_An_algorithm_to_recognize_the_3-sphere","306946449_Foliations_and_the_topology_of_3-manifolds_III","303656055_Integer_homology_3-spheres_admit_irreducible_representations_in_SL2C","288167950_Finiteness_results_for_Heegaard_surfaces_in_surgered_manifolds","269722277_On_the_Complexity_of_Immersed_Normal_Surfaces","266536759_Knottedness_is_in_modulo_GRH","265825993_Topology_and_Combinatorics_of_3-Manifolds","265333403_Theorie_der_Normalflachen_Ein_Isotopiekriterium_fur_den_Kreisknoten","251807435_Heegaard_surfaces_in_Haken_3-manifolds","248843080_Heegaard_structures_of_manifolds_in_the_Dehn_filling_space","248077366_Thin_position_for_3-manifolds","246543921_Irreducible_Heegaard_splittings_of_Seifert_fibered_spaces_are_either_vertical_or_horizontal","242076839_Topological_Index_Theory_for_surfaces_in_3-manifolds","228557832_Thin_Position_and_the_Recognition_Problem_for_boldS3","226959375_Heegaard_splittings_of_surface_x_I_are_standard","223509597_Persistence_of_Heegaard_structures_under_Dehn_filling","222300058_Decision_problems_in_the_space_of_Dehn_fillings","51989886_Stabilizing_and_destabilizing_Heegaard_splittings_of_sufficientlycomplicated_3-manifolds","45900297_An_algorithm_to_determine_the_Heegaard_genus_of_a_3-manifold","2108791_Computation_of_Hyperbolic_Structures_in_Knot_Theory","1742367_Heegaard_surfaces_and_the_distance_of_amalgamation"]}
