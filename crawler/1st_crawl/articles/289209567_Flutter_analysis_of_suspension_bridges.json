{"id":"289209567_Flutter_analysis_of_suspension_bridges","abstract":"A procedure for flutter analysis of suspension bridges using the normal mode method and two-dimensional unsteady aerodynamics is presented in this paper. The dynamic stiffness method using bending-torsion coupled beam theory with warping stiffness included is used in the modal analysis whereas the aerodynamic forces are modelled using the Theodorsen type flat plate theory. The generalized mass, stiffness and aerodynamic matrices are obtained in modal coordinates. The flutter matrix is then formulated by summing algebraically the generalized mass, stiffness and aerodynamic matrices. Finally the flutter determinant is solved for flutter speed and flutter frequency. This is achieved by locating the flutter condition when both the real and imaginary parts of the flutter determinant (hence the whole flutter determinant) are zero. The method is demonstrated by numerical results obtained for the Innoshima bridge situated between Honshu and Shikoku in Japan.","authors":["J.R.
