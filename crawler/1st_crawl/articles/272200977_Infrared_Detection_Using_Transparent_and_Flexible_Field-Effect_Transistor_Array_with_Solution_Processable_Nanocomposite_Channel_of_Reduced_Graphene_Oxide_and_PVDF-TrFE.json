{"id":"272200977_Infrared_Detection_Using_Transparent_and_Flexible_Field-Effect_Transistor_Array_with_Solution_Processable_Nanocomposite_Channel_of_Reduced_Graphene_Oxide_and_PVDF-TrFE","abstract":"Photodetectors using optically responsive graphene (Gr) or reduced graphene oxide (R-GO) on rigid substrates have showed promising results for detection of broad band light including infrared (IR). However, there have been only a few reports on Gr or R-GO photodetectors with new functionalities such as optical transparency and/or flexibility. Herein, a new kind of transparent and flexible IR photodetector is presented using a field-effect transistor (FET) structure in which an IR-responsive nanocomposite layer of R-GO and poly(vinylidenefluoride-co-trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF-TrFE)) is employed as the channel. The IR photodetector exhibits high IR responsivity, stability, and reproducibility under mechanical strain and ambient conditions. In addition, the capability of measuring the distribution of responses from each device in the transparent and flexible nanocomposite FET array under IR radiation from the human body is also demonstrated. Therefore, the development of a flexible IR photodetector with high responsivity, transparency, ease of integration, and stability in an ambient environment is a suitable alternative approach for achieving the stable monitoring of IR in many flexible and transparent electronic systems.","authors":["Tran Quang Trung","Subramaniyan Ramasundaram","Nae-Eung Lee"],"meta":["February 2015Advanced Functional Materials 25(11)","DOI:10.1002/adfm.201404582"],"references":["258341641_High_Responsivity_GrapheneSilicon_Heterostructure_Waveguide_Photodetectors","256612487_Oxygen-Assisted_Charge_Transfer_Between_ZnO_Quantum_Dots_and_Graphene","236915833_Self-powered_flexible_and_transparent_photovoltaic_detectors_based_on_CdSe_nanobeltgraphene_Schottky_junctions","236653320_Broadband_High_Photoresponse_from_Pure_Monolayer_Graphene_Photodetector","224543554_Third-generation_infrared_photodetector_arrays","223985526_Ultrathin_and_lightweight_organic_solar_cells_with_high_flexibility","221666514_Photoconductivity_of_biased_graphene","51699611_Hot_Carrier-Assisted_Intrinsic_Photoresponse_in_Graphene","51247173_Laser_Patterning_of_Epitaxial_Graphene_for_Schottky_Junction_Photodetectors","47450458_Waterproof_AlInGaP_optoelectronics_on_stretchable_substrates_with_applications_in_biomedicine_and_robotics","46586774_Graphene_photodetectors_for_high-speed_optical_communications","45925709_Graphene_Photonics_and_Optoelectronics","44602481_Nanostructured_materials_for_photon_detection","38070964_Ultrafast_Graphene_Photodetector","26756804_Printed_Assemblies_of_Inorganic_Light-Emitting_Diodes_for_Deformable_and_Semitransparent_Displays","23993643_Photocurrent_Imaging_and_Efficient_Photon_Detection_in_a_Graphene_Transistor","264716823_Flexible_and_Transparent_Nanocomposite_of_Reduced_Graphene_Oxide_and_PVDF-TrFE_Copolymer_for_High_Thermal_Responsivity_in_a_Field-Effect_Transistor","264592590_High-Performance_Organic-Inorganic_Hybrid_Photodetectors_Based_on_P3HTCdSe_Nanowire_Heterojunctions_on_Rigid_and_Flexible_Substrates","264356462_ITO-Free_and_Flexible_Organic_Photovoltaic_Device_Based_on_High_Transparent_and_Conductive_PolyanilineCarbon_Nanotube_Thin_Films","263131778_Large-Area_Transparent_and_Flexible_Infrared_Photodetector_Fabricated_Using_P-N_Junctions_Formed_by_N-doping_CVD-Grown_Graphene","261517653_Photosensitive_Graphene_Transistors","260842151_Graphene_photodetectors_with_ultra-broadband_and_high_responsivity_at_room_temperature","260801238_Transparent_Ultrathin_Oxygen-Doped_Silver_Electrodes_for_Flexible_Organic_Solar_Cells","231713609_Graphene_Transistors_Fabricated_via_Transfer-Printing_In_Device_Active-Areas_on_Large_Wafer","230913675_Recent_progress_in_high-temperature_superconductor_bolometric_detectors_From_the_mid-infrared_to_the_far-infrared_THz_range","230769312_Infrared_Photodetectors_Based_on_CVD-Grown_Graphene_and_PbS_Quantum_Dots_with_Ultrahigh_Responsivity","229323396_High_Thermal_Responsiveness_of_a_Reduced_Graphene_Oxide_Field-Effect_Transistor","224707051_Graphene_Photonics_Plasmonics_and_Broadband_Optoelectronic_Devices","222838141_Synthesis_and_exfoliation_of_isocyanate-treated_graphene_oxide_nanoplatelets","51630719_Electrical_Assembly_and_Reduction_of_Graphene_Oxide_in_a_Single_Solution_Step_for_Use_in_Flexible_Sensors","51607477_Gate-Activated_Photoresponse_in_a_Graphene_p-n_Junction","51518615_Apology_Infrared_Photodetectors_Based_on_Reduced_Graphene_Oxide_and_Graphene_Nanoribbons","46819110_Graphene_Electronic_and_Photonic_Properties_and_Devices","46182160_Thin_Film_Field-Effect_Phototransistors_from_Bandgap-Tunable_Solution-Processed_Few-Layer_Reduced_Graphene_Oxide_Films","44571993_Centimeter-Long_and_Large-Scale_Micropatterns_of_Reduced_Graphene_Oxide_Films_Fabrication_and_Sensing_Applications","24239474_Imaging_of_Photocurrent_Generation_and_Collection_in_Single-Layer_Graphene","24181238_Colloidal_Suspensions_of_Highly_Reduced_Graphene_Oxide_in_a_Wide_Variety_of_Organic_Solvents","6286934_Near-Infrared_Resonant_Nanoshells_for_Combined_Optical_Imaging_and_Photothermal_Cancer_Therapy"]}
