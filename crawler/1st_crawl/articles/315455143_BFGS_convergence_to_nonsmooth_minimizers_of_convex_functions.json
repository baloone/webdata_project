{"id":"315455143_BFGS_convergence_to_nonsmooth_minimizers_of_convex_functions","abstract":"The popular BFGS quasi-Newton minimization algorithm under reasonable conditions converges globally on smooth convex functions. This result was proved by Powell in 1976: we consider its implications for functions that are not smooth. In particular, an analogous convergence result holds for functions, like the Euclidean norm, that are nonsmooth at the minimizer.","authors":["Jiayi Guo","Adrian S.
