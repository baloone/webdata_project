{"id":"227311719_Simulatable_Adaptive_Oblivious_Transfer","abstract":"We study an adaptive variant of oblivious transfer in which a sender has N messages, of which a receiver can adaptively choose to receive k one-after-the-other, in such a way that (a) the sender learns nothing about the receiverâ€™s selections, and (b) the receiver\nonly learns about the k requested messages. We propose two practical protocols for this primitive that achieve a stronger security notion than previous\nschemes with comparable efficiency. In particular, by requiring full simulatability for both sender and receiver security,\nour notion prohibits a subtle selective-failure attack not addressed by the security notions achieved by previous practical\nschemes.\n\nOur first protocol is a very efficient generic construction from unique blind signatures in the random oracle model. The second\nconstruction does not assume random oracles, but achieves remarkable efficiency with only a constant number of group elements\nsent during each transfer. This second construction uses novel techniques for building efficient simulatable protocols.","authors":["Jan Camenisch","Gregory Neven","Abhi Shelat"],"meta":["June 2007","DOI:10.1007/978-3-540-72540-4_33","Sourcedx.doi.org","Conference: Proceedings of the 26th annual international conference on Advances in Cryptology"],"references":["243300730_Efficient_Group_Signature_Schemes_for_Large_Groups","239708714_On_Security_of_Sublinear_Oblivious_Transfer","239066122_Foundations_of_cryptography_II_Basic_applications","234778924_How_to_play_ANY_mental_game","226937332_Invariant_Signatures_and_Non-Interactive_Zero-Knowledge_Proofs_are_Equivalent_Extended_Abstract","226775659_The_One-More-RSA-Inversion_Problems_and_the_Security_of_Chaum's_Blind_Signature_Scheme","226552751_Security_of_blind_digital_signatures","225456960_All-or-Nothing_Disclosure_of_Secrets","225139870_A_Verifiable_Random_Function_with_Short_Proofs_and_Keys","221355350_A_Randomized_Protocol_for_Signing_Contracts","221354868_Weakening_Security_Assumptions_and_Oblivious_Transfer_Abstract","221354729_Security_of_Blind_Digital_Signatures_Extended_Abstract","221348456_Security_Proofs_for_Signature_Schemes","221208337_On_the_Impossibility_of_Blind_Message_Authentication_Codes","221010535_Threshold_Signatures_Multisignatures_and_Blind_Signatures_Based_on_the_Gap-Diffie-Hellman-Group_Signature_Scheme","220479120_The_One-More-RSA-Inversion_Problems_and_the_Security_of_Chaum's_Blind_Signature_Scheme","220478966_Trapdoor_Hard-to-Invert_Group_Isomorphisms_and_Their_Application_to_Password-Based_Authentication","220427288_A_Randomized_Protocol_for_Signing_Contracts","220337107_The_One-More-RSA-Inversion_Problems_and_the_Security_of_Chaum's_Blind_Signature_Scheme","220337087_A_Verifiable_Random_Function_With_Short_Proofs_and_Keys","2811832_Invariant_Signatures_and_Non-Interactive_Zero-Knowledge_Proofs_are_Equivalent","2481355_On_Defining_Proofs_of_Knowledge","2451591_All-or_Nothing_Disclosure_of_Secrets","313391158_Security_of_blind_digital_signatures","262320797_Efficient_k-Out-of-n_Oblivious_Transfer_Schemes_with_Adaptive_and_Non-adaptive_Queries","261847826_Non-interactive_oblivious_transfer_and_applications","239007266_A_new_traitor_tracing","238679474_Security_and_composition_of_multiparty_cryptographic_protocols","238282552_Oblivious_transfer_based_on_blind_signatures","234782642_Conjugate_Coding","226388648_Smooth_Projective_Hashing_and_Two-Message_Oblivious_Transfer","225352899_Short_Signatures_Without_Random_Oracles","225134469_Efficient_1-Out-n_Oblivious_Transfer_Schemes","222517985_Oblivious_keyword_search","221591851_How_to_Play_any_Mental_Game_or_A_Completeness_Theorem_for_Protocols_with_Honest_Majority","221590619_Oblivious_Transfer_and_Polynomial_Evaluation","221355005_Blind_Signature_System","221354905_Efficient_Group_Signature_Schemes_for_Large_Groups_Extended_Abstract","221354772_Signature_Schemes_and_Anonymous_Credentials_from_Bilinear_Maps","221348645_Priced_Oblivious_Transfer_How_to_Sell_Digital_Goods","220779275_Efficient_oblivious_transfer_protocols","220685992_A_public_key_cryptosystem_and_a_signature_scheme_based_on_discrete_logarithms","220479175_Canetti_R_Security_and_Composition_of_Multiparty_Cryptographic_Protocols_Journal_of_Cryptology_131_143-202","220334453_Efficient_Blind_and_Partially_Blind_Signatures_Without_Random_Oracles","220332997_How_To_Exchange_Secrets_with_Oblivious_Transfer","220235462_k_out_of_n_Oblivious_Transfer_without_Random_Oracles","3084210_A_Publi-Key_Cryptosystem_and_Signature_Scheme_Based_on_Discrete_Logarithms_IEEE_Transactions_on_Information_Theory_314_469-472","2596616_Random_Oracles_are_Practical_A_Paradigm_for_Designing_Efficient_Protocols","2586965_Computationally_Secure_Oblivious_Transfer","2472761_Priced_Oblivious_Transfer_How_to_Sell_Digital_Goods","2360344_Efficient_Zero-Knowledge_Proofs_of_Knowledge_Without_Intractability_Assumptions","2379120_Concurrent_Zero-Knowledge","2305740_Oblivious_Transfer_with_Adaptive_Queries"]}
