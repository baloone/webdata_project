{"id":"340532083_Algebraic_Inverses_on_Lie_Algebra_Comultiplications","abstract":"In this note, we investigate algebraic loop structures and inverses of elements of a set of all homomorphisms of Lie algebras with a binary operation derived from a Lie algebra comultiplication. As a symmetry phenomenon, we show that if l ( 1 ) c and r ( 1 ) c are the left and right inverses of the identity 1 : L → L on a free graded Lie algebra L , respectively, based on the Lie algebra comultiplication ψ c : L → L ⊔ L , then we have l ( 1 ) = l ( 1 ) c and r ( 1 ) = r ( 1 ) c , where c : L → L ⊔ L is a commutator.","authors":["Dae-Woong Lee"],"meta":["April 2020Symmetry 12(4):565","DOI:10.3390/sym12040565"],"references":["338405556_Comultiplications_on_the_Localized_Spheres_and_Moore_Spaces","331854700_New_Type_Direction_Curves_in_3-Dimensional_Compact_Lie_Group","322218183_A_q_-deformation_of_the_Bogoliubov_transformations","330250828_Homotopy_comultiplications_on_the_k-fold_wedge_of_spheres","325438301_Homotopy_associativity_of_H-spaces_I","317284536_Birth_of_the_GUP_and_its_effect_on_the_entropy_of_the_Universe_in_Lie-N-algebra","262769039_On_inverses_and_algebraic_loops_of_co-H-spaces","259090423_Commutator_theory_for_loops","243075837_Homotopy_associativity_of_H-spaces_I_II","243066665_On_the_same_N-type_conjecture_for_the_suspension_of_the_infinite_complex_projective_space"]}
