{"id":"321849894_Fuzzy_Selection_of_Local_Search_Sites_in_the_Bees_Algorithm","abstract":"The Bees Algorithm is a swarm-based algorithm that mimics the natural food foraging behaviour of honey bees. The algorithm essentially involves both random exploration of the solution space and more focused exploitation of promising local search sites. A basic version of the Bees Algorithm has been applied to function optimisation and a variety of other practical problems. This paper describes an enhanced version implementing fuzzy greedy selection of local search sites. The paper presents the results obtained for a number of benchmark problems to demonstrate the robustness and self-organising ability of the new Bees Algorithm.","authors":["D. T.
