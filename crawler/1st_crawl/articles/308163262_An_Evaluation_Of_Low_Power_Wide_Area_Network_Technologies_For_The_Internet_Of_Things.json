{"id":"308163262_An_Evaluation_Of_Low_Power_Wide_Area_Network_Technologies_For_The_Internet_Of_Things","abstract":"We explore the state of the art in solutions for low power wide area (LPWA) networks and technologies serving the Internet of Things (IoT) and Connectivity for Everything markets. These networks are forecast to capture up to 55% market share using battery-powered devices operating up to 10 years and link distances measured in tens of kilometers. In this paper, we survey two LPWA technologies; ultra-narrow band solutions by SigFox and the LoRa technology by Semtech. Both technologies operate in the licence-exempt industrial, scientific, & medical (ISM) bands (EU 868 MHz / US 915 MHz). We survey both solutions in terms of physical layer (PHY) and associated medium access control (MAC) capabilities from an end-to-end system viewpoint. We then proceed to explore coverage ranges in eastern Ireland. We present results indicating a potential coverage area of 3, 800 km 2 and from a real-world experimental test case involving the use of SigFox's technology operating over a 25 km test link between a 25 mW LPWA client test and a basestation. Finally, we provide example results demonstrating a received SNR consistently exceeding 20 dB over this test link distance.","authors":["Keith Nolan","Wael Guibene","Mark Y.
