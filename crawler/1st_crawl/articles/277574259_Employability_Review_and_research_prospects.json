{"id":"277574259_Employability_Review_and_research_prospects","abstract":"Professional transition, employment, and reemployment are major concerns for nations facing adverse economic situations. The employability construct represents a scientific challenge in order to better understand the relationship between the job seekers’ issues and the expectations of the world of work. This paper presents a review of the concept of employability. Three main perspectives (educational and governmental, organizational, and individual) that are not exclusive can be identified. This review highlights the importance of adopting a systemic integrative approach and a wider interpretation of employability. A research agenda to develop the theory and applications of the concept of employability is proposed.","authors":["Laure Guilbert","Jean-Luc Bernaud","Brice Gouvernet","Jérôme Rossier"],"meta":["March 2015International Journal for Educational and Vocational Guidance 16(1)","DOI:10.1007/s10775-015-9288-4"],"references":["333765939_Improving_Transition_Outcomes_for_Culturally_and_Linguistically_Diverse_VR_Consumers","314930152_EMBEDDING_EMPLOYABILITY_IN_THE_CURRICULUM_-_THE_AWARE_FRAMEWORK","306285028_Handbook_of_Life_Design_From_Practice_to_Theory_and_from_Theory_to_Practice","305301273_Personality_assessment_and_career_interventions","305300995_Personality_assessment_and_career_interventions","292782262_Influence_of_adjustment_and_physical_attractiveness_on_the_employability_of_schizophrenic_women","266870464_Employer_Strategies_for_Responding_to_an_Aging_Workforce_Employer_Strategies_for_Responding_to_an_Aging_Workforce","264509929_Promoting_employability_in_a_flat_world","264509857_The_impact_of_life_role_salience_on_life_satisfaction","263553368_Management_of_Employability_in_The_Netherlands"]}
