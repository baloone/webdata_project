{"id":"275364279_Formalizing_Preference_Utilitarianism_in_Physical_World_Models","abstract":"Most ethical work is done at a low level of formality. This makes practical\nmoral questions inaccessible to formal and natural sciences and can lead to\nmisunderstandings in ethical discussion. In this paper, we use Bayesian\ninference to introduce a formalization of preference utilitarianism in physical\nworld models, specifically cellular automata. Even though our formalization is\nnot immediately applicable, it could provide ethics and ultimately the question\nof how to \"make the world better\" with a formal basis.","authors":["Caspar Ã–sterheld"],"meta":["September 2016Synthese 193(9)","DOI:10.1007/s11229-015-0883-1","SourcearXiv"],"references":["344486712_Moral_Thinking","325451237_An_Introduction_to_Decision_Theory","320182421_Superintelligence_paths_dangers_strategies","320182027_A_new_kind_of_science","317623487_Moral_Thinking_Its_Levels_Method_and_Point","290890495_How_machines_might_help_us_achieve_breakthroughs_in_ethical_theory_and_inspire_us_to_behave_better","290186755_Machine_metaethics","283617645_Bayesian_probability_theory","281099307_Machine_Ethics","273988644_Intentional_Systems"]}
