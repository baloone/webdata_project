{"id":"330811464_Exploring_Vector_Space_Models_to_Predict_the_Compositionality_of_German_Noun-Noun_Compounds","abstract":"This paper explores two hypotheses regarding vector space models that predict the compo-sitionality of German noun-noun compounds: (1) Against our intuition, we demonstrate that window-based rather than syntax-based distri-butional features perform better predictions, and that not adjectives or verbs but nouns represent the most salient part-of-speech. Our overall best result is state-of-the-art, reaching Spearman's ρ = 0.65 with a word-space model of nominal features from a 20-word window of a 1.5 billion word web corpus. (2) While there are no significant differences in predicting compound-modifier vs. compound-head ratings on compositionality, we show that the modifier (rather than the head) properties predominantly influence the degree of compositionality of the compound.","authors":["Sabine Schulte Im Walde","Stefan Müller","Stephen Roller"],"meta":["January 2013","Conference: *SEM","Project: Compositionality and Figurative Language Usage"],"references":["330811400_Exploring_Features_to_Identify_Semantic_Nearest_Neighbours_A_Case_Study_on_German_Particle_Verbs","326718307_The_Unexpected_Effects_of_Applying_Standard_Cleansing_Models_to_Human_Ratings_on_Compositionality","293089891_Determining_the_degree_of_compositionality_of_German_particle_verbs_by_clustering_approaches","288971776_Introduction_Status_and_Definition_of_Compounding","312927331_Nonparametric_statistics_for_the_Behavioral_Sciences","311207397_Intensionality_was_only_alleged_On_adjective-noun_composition_in_distributional_semantics","264474244_Vector_Space_Models_of_Word_Meaning_and_Phrase_Meaning_A_Survey","264238478_Wortbildung_der_deutschen_Gegenwartssprache","251597069_Inferential_processing_and_meta-knowledge_as_the_bases_for_property_inclusion_in_combined_concepts","247344672_Constituent_integration_during_the_processing_of_compound_words_Does_it_involve_the_use_of_relational_structures"]}
