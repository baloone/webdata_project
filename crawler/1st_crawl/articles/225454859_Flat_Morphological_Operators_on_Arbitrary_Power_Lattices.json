{"id":"225454859_Flat_Morphological_Operators_on_Arbitrary_Power_Lattices","abstract":"We give here the basis for a general theory of flat morphological operators for functions defined on a space E and taking their values in an arbitrary complete lattice V . Contrarily to Heijmans [4], [6], we make no assumption on the complete lattice V , and in contrast with Serra [18], we rely exclusively on the usual construction of flat operators by thresholding and stacking.\nSome known properties of flat operators for numerical functions (V = \\(\n\\overline Z\n\\)\nor \\(\n\\overline R\n\\)\n) extend to this general framework: flat dilations and erosions, flat extension of a union of operators or of a composition of an operator by a dilation. Others donâ€™t, unless V is completely distributive: flat extension of an intersection or of a composition of operators; for these we give counterexamples with V being the non-distributive lattice of labels. In another paper [15], we will consider the commutation of flat operators with anamorphoses (contrast functions) and thresholdings, duality by inversion, as well as related questions of continuity.","authors":["Christian Ronse"],"meta":["January 2003Lecture Notes in Computer Science 2616:17-26","DOI:10.1007/3-540-36586-9_1","In book: Geometry, Morphology, and Computational Imaging (pp.17-26)"],"references":["220932183_Spatio-Temporal_Segmentation_Using_3D_Morphological_Tools","3178433_Morphological_filters_-_part_II_their_relations_to_median_order-statistics_and_stack_filters_IEEE_Trans_Acoust_Speech_Signal_Process","3178064_Stack_filters","337716002_Mathematical_Morphology_on_Complete_Semilattices_and_its_Applications_to_Image_Processing","277281464_Lattice_Theory","257823473_Inf-Semilattice_Approach_to_Self-Dual_Morphology","230837985_Anamorphoses_and_Function_Lattices_Multivalued_Morphology","228754401_Extension_of_morphological_operations_to_complete_semilattices_and_its_applications_to_image_and_video_processing","223607936_Why_mathematical_mophology_needs_complete_lattices","222742274_Order-configuration_functions_Mathematical_characterizations_and_applications_to_digital_signal_and_image_processing","220632595_The_algebraic_basis_of_mathematical_morphology_I_Dilations_and_erosions","220443672_Mathematical_Morphology_on_Complete_Semilattices_and_its_Applications_to_Image_Processing","35052815_Completely_Distributive_Complete_Lattices","3191913_Theoretical_aspects_of_gray-level_morphology"]}
