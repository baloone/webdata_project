{"id":"220816346_Nested_Monte-Carlo_Search","abstract":"Many problems have a huge state space and no good heuristic to order moves so as to guide the search toward the best positions. Random games can be used to score positions and evaluate their interest. Random games can also be improved us- ing random games to choose a move to try at each step of a game. Nested Monte-Carlo Search ad- dresses the problem of guiding the search toward better states when there is no available heuristic. It uses nested levels of random games in order to guide the search. The algorithm is studied theoreti- cally on simple abstract problems and applied suc- cessfully to three different games: Morpion Soli- taire, SameGame and 16x16 Sudoku.","authors":["Tristan Cazenave"],"meta":["January 2009","SourceDBLP","Conference: IJCAI 2009, Proceedings of the 21st International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Pasadena, California, USA, July 11-17, 2009"],"references":["220962457_Single-Player_Monte-Carlo_Tree_Search","220174445_A_Survey_of_NP-Complete_puzzles","44842175_Reflexive_Monte-Carlo_Search","221619944_On-line_Policy_Improvement_using_Monte-Carlo_Search","221619435_Solitaire_Man_Versus_Machine","220544121_Morpion_Solitaire","220174554_Searching_Solitaire_in_Real_Time"]}
