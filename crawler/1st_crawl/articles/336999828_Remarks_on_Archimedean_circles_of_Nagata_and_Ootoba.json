{"id":"336999828_Remarks_on_Archimedean_circles_of_Nagata_and_Ootoba","abstract":"We consider two sangaku problems involving Archimedean circles proposed by Nagata and Ootoba, and give a brief historical note for their Archimedean circles. Nagata's Archimedean circles are obtained from the generalized Ootoba's Archimedean circle in [12] as a special case by division by zero [10]. We consider certain tangents of the Archimedean circle in the same case, which are not considered in [12].","authors":["Hiroshi Okumura"],"meta":["November 2019","Projects: arbelosWasan Geometry"],"references":["336592358_The_arbelos_in_Wasan_geometry_Ootoba's_problem_and_Archimedean_circles","335619911_A_characterization_of_the_golden_arbelos_involving_an_Archimedean_circle","333324368_Division_by_Zero_Calculus_and_Pompe's_Theorem","329210266_Wasan_Geometry_and_Division_by_Zero_Calculus","327498437_APPLICATIONS_OF_THE_DIVISION_BY_ZERO_CALCULUS_TO_WASAN_GEOMETRY","326305488_Solution_to_2017-1_Problem_4_with_division_by_zero","324165661_Wasan_geometry_with_the_division_by_0","324467980_Those_Ubiquitous_Archimedean_Circles","323198073_Are_the_Twin_Circles_of_Archimedes_Really_Twins","317868711_Japanese_Temple_Geometry_Problems"]}
