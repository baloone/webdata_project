We worked with the universe of 32 students studying the matter in the first group of the program and with the twelve teachers that taught the matter; surveys were applied to both of the groups. To collect the information we also made a structured interview to key informants, and obtained information from the records of the Educational Secretary of the State, allowing us to present and discuss the results. With everything, it was possible to identify factors related with the academic performance in the matter studied, grouped according to the assumed classification. When the study was concluded they turned out to be related with the socioeconomic aspects, the academic aspects before entering the career, and the academic aspects during the teaching-learning process in the matter Human Morpho-Physiology IV, with the characteristic of being the fourth part of a matter that is imparted. These last ones, proper of the teaching process, were identified as the one with bigger relevance.","authors":["Caridad Martínez Pedroso","Yamilka Eulalia Leiva Cubeñas","Esther G Báez Pérez","José Fernández Morín"],"meta":["April 2011"],"references":["28178537_Factores_resilientes_asociados_al_rendimiento_academico_en_estudiantes_pertenecientes_a_la_Universidad_de_Sucre_Colombia","251076877_Factores_asociados_al_rendimiento_academico_en_estudiantes_de_Medicina","4722339_Factores_que_inciden_en_el_rendimiento_escolar_en_Bolivia"]}
