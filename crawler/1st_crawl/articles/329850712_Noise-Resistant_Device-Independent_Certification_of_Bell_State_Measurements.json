{"id":"329850712_Noise-Resistant_Device-Independent_Certification_of_Bell_State_Measurements","abstract":"Device-independent certification refers to the characterization of an apparatus without reference to the internal description of other devices. It is a trustworthy certification method, free of assumption on the underlying Hilbert space dimension and on calibration methods. We show how it can be used to quantify the quality of a Bell-state measurement, whether deterministic, partial, or probabilistic. Our certification is noise resistant and opens the way towards the device-independent self-testing of Bell-state measurements in existing experiments.","authors":["Jean-Daniel Bancal","Nicolas Sangouard","Pavel Sekatski"],"meta":["December 2018Physical Review Letters 121(25)","DOI:10.1103/PhysRevLett.121.250506"],"references":["329850212_Self-Testing_Entangled_Measurements_in_Quantum_Networks","326883034_Self-Testing_multipartite_entangled_states_through_projections_onto_two_systems","310953056_All_Pure_Bipartite_Entangled_States_can_be_Self-Tested","228109500_Proposed_Experiment_to_Test_Local_Hidden-Variable_Theories","221668727_Imperfect_measurement_settings_Implications_for_quantum_state_tomography_and_entanglement_witnesses","51595295_Device-Independent_Certification_of_Entangled_Measurements","51503549_Device-Independent_Witnesses_of_Genuine_Multipartite_Entanglement","45856831_Quantum_repeaters_based_on_atomic_ensembles_and_linear_optics","43148427_Random_Numbers_Certified_by_Bell's_Theorem","13243740_Maximal_violation_of_Bell_inequalities_for_mixed_states","323130140_On_the_Einstein_Podolsky_Rosen_paradox","323003847_Certifying_the_Building_Blocks_of_Quantum_Computers_from_Bell's_Theorem","319300533_Witnessing_Irreducible_Dimension","313893347_Self-testing_of_binary_observables_based_on_commutation","301817931_Analytic_and_nearly_optimal_self-testing_bounds_for_the_Clauser-Holt-Shimony-Horne_and_Mermin_inequalities","287250541_Post_hoc_Verification_of_Quantum_Computation","275587986_Sum-of-squares_decompositions_for_a_family_of_CHSH-like_inequalities_and_their_application_to_self-testing","273491181_Physical_characterization_of_quantum_devices_from_nonlocal_correlations","263507321_Robust_and_Versatile_Black-Box_Certification_of_Quantum_Devices","243255771_Which_states_violate_Bell's_inequality_maximally","236338799_Classical_command_of_quantum_systems","228109498_Quantum_generalizations_of_Bell's_inequality","13245023_Ekert_AK_Quantum_Cryptography_Based_on_Bell's_Theorem_Phys_Rev_Lett_676_661","6768992_From_Bell's_Theorem_to_Secure_Quantum_Key_Distribution","6161249_Device-Independent_Security_of_Quantum_Cryptography_against_Collective_Attacks","2187717_Fidelity_of_mixed_states_of_two_qubits"]}
