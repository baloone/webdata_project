{"id":"263545192_Intelligent_emergency_message_broadcasting_in_VANET_using_PSO","abstract":"The new type of Mobile Ad hoc Network which is called Vehicular Ad hoc\nNetworks (VANET) created a fertile environment for research. In this research,\na protocol Particle Swarm Optimization Contention Based Broadcast (PCBB) is\nproposed, for fast andeffective dissemination of emergency messages within a\ngeographical area to distribute the emergency message and achieve the safety\nsystem, this research will help the VANET system to achieve its safety goals in\nintelligent and efficient way.","authors":["Ghassan Samara","Tareq Alhmiedat"],"meta":["June 2014","SourcearXiv"],"references":["253879375_Increase_emergency_message_reception_in_VANET","235246974_Increasing_Network_Visibility_Using_Coded_Repetition_Beacon_Piggybacking","224692885_Inter-vehicle_communications_Assessing_information_dissemination_under_safety_constraints","224676354_An_Effective_Broadcast_Scheme_for_Alert_Message_Propagation_in_Vehicular_Ad_hoc_Networks","224394976_Vehicle-to-Vehicle_Communication_Fair_Transmit_Power_Control_for_Safety-Critical_Information","220926567_The_Broadcast_Storm_Problem_in_a_Mobile_ad_hoc_Network","292255811_Increasing_network_visibility_using_coded_repetition_beacon_piggybacking","224212134_A_Multi-Hop_Broadcast_scheme_for_propagation_of_emergency_messages_in_VANET","222664362_Contention-Based_Forwarding_for_Mobile_Ad_Hoc_Networks","221192615_Street_Broadcast_with_Smart_Relay_for_Emergency_Messages_in_VANET","220293186_The_Broadcast_Storm_Problem_in_a_Mobile_Ad_Hoc_Network","200838624_Security_issues_and_challenges_of_Vehicular_Ad_Hoc_Networks_VANET","200838608_Security_analysis_of_vehicular_ad_hoc_networks_VANET","37433732_Certificate_Revocation_in_Vehicular_Networks","220926300_Urban_Multi-Hop_Broadcast_Protocol_for_Inter-Vehicle_Communication_Systems"]}
