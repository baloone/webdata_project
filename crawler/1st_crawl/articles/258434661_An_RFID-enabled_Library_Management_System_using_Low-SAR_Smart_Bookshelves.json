{"id":"258434661_An_RFID-enabled_Library_Management_System_using_Low-SAR_Smart_Bookshelves","abstract":"An intelligent Library Management System (LMS) based on the emerging UHF passive RFID technology is currently being designed in order to replace a traditional barcode system at the universityâ€™s library. Primary objectives of the design include maximization of tag readability, localization of tagged items in the smart bookshelf, reduced spill-over energy to nearby shelves, and minimization of the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) to nearby library users. Different types of shelf antennas were used and tested including evanescent-type antennas as well as far-field antennas. The antennas were designed, simulated, built, and tested in a realistic environment. HFSS and SEMCAD-X were used to evaluate radiation parameters and illustrate the radiation effects of near- and far-field antennas in the presence of the cabinet and library users.","authors":["Ioannis Thomas Markakis","Theodoros Samaras","Anastasis C Polycarpou","J.N.
