{"id":"321325957_How_linguistic_descriptions_of_data_can_help_to_the_teaching-learning_process_in_higher_education_case_of_study_artificial_intelligence","abstract":"Artificial Intelligence is a central topic in the computer science curriculum. From the year 2011 a project-based learning methodology based on computer games has been designed and implemented into the intelligence artificial course at the University of the B\\'io-B\\'io. The project aims to develop software-controlled agents (bots) which are programmed by using heuristic algorithms seen during the course. This methodology allows us to obtain good learning results, however several challenges have been founded during its implementation. In this paper we show how linguistic descriptions of data can help to provide students and teachers with technical and personalized feedback about the learned algorithms. Algorithm behavior profile and a new Turing test for computer games bots based on linguistic modelling of complex phenomena are also proposed in order to deal with such challenges. In order to show and explore the possibilities of this new technology, a web platform has been designed and implemented by one of authors and its incorporation in the process of assessment allows us to improve the teaching learning process.","authors":["Clemente Rubio Manzano","Tomás Lermanda Senoceaín"],"meta":["November 2017","Project: Linguistic Description of Data in Higher Education / Universidad y Descripción Lingüística de Datos"],"references":["336970509_Fuzzy_linguistic_descriptions_for_execution_trace_comprehension_and_their_application_in_an_introductory_course_in_artificial_intelligence","332445812_Cubic_bipolar_fuzzy_ordered_weighted_geometric_aggregation_operators_and_their_application_using_internal_and_external_cubic_bipolar_fuzzy_data","328173570_Similarity_Measure_Between_Linguistic_Terms_by_Using_Restricted_Equivalence_Functions_and_Its_Application_to_Expert_Systems","323303428_Fuzzy_Parameterized_Fuzzy_Soft_Compact_Spaces_with_Decision-Making","333794018_N-soft_topology_and_its_applications_to_multi-criteria_group_decision_making","332386925_Novel_concepts_of_soft_rough_set_topology_with_applications","330547809_Special_issue_on_Similarity_Correlation_and_Association_Measures_Dedicated_to_the_memory_of_Lotfi_Zadeh","328399690_An_Ensemble_Fuzzy_Logic_Approach_to_Game_Bot_Detection_through_Behavioural_Features","327638265_Classification_of_Humans_and_Bots_in_Two_Typical_Two-player_Computer_Games","327635227_Studying_believability_assessment_in_racing_games","322582654_Linguistic_Description_of_Complex_Phenomena_with_the_rLDCP_R_Package","315696017_Survey_of_the_State_of_the_Art_in_Natural_Language_Generation_Core_tasks_applications_and_evaluation","315669434_rLDCP_R_package_for_text_generation_from_data","318948438_Student_and_instructor_responses_to_emotional_motivational_feedback_messages_in_an_online_instructional_environment","316913853_New_Types_of_Computational_Perceptions_Linguistic_Descriptions_in_Deforestation_Analysis"]}
