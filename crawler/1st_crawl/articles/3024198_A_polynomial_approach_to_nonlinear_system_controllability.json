{"id":"3024198_A_polynomial_approach_to_nonlinear_system_controllability","abstract":"Uses a polynomial approach to present a necessary and sufficient\ncondition for local controllability of single-input-single-output (SISO)\nnonlinear systems. The condition is presented in terms of common factors\nof a noncommutative polynomial expression. This result exposes\ncontrollability properties of a nonlinear system in the input-output\nframework, and gives a computable procedure for examining nonlinear\nsystem controllability using computer algebra","authors":["Yufan Zheng","Jan C.
