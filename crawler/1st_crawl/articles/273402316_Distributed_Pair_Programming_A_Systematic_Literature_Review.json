{"id":"273402316_Distributed_Pair_Programming_A_Systematic_Literature_Review","abstract":"Context Geographically distributed teams have adopted agile practices as a work strategy. One of these practices is Distributed Pair Programming (DPP). DPP consists in two developers working remotely on the same design, algorithm or code. Objective In this paper we sought to identify and synthesize papers that describe and analyze DPP both from teaching and practice perspectives. Method We conducted a Systematic Literature Review to search for empirical evidence in eight digital libraries. Results Most of the 34 DPP primary studies identified explore DPP from a teaching perspective. We found that DPP requires a specific infrastructure, but the existing studies do not explore the impact of the distribution in the details. There are many tools proposed that support DPP practice, but few of them are evaluated within a software development team. Conclusion We need more studies that explore the effects of Pair Programming in the context of Distributed Software Development, such as coordination and communication. Most of the studies do not empirically evaluate DPP in industry. There is also a need to propose guidelines to use DPP in industry and as a teaching strategy.","authors":["Bernardo Est√°cio","Rafael Prikladnicki"],"meta":["March 2015Information and Software Technology 50","DOI:10.1016/j.infsof.2015.02.011"],"references":["258968007_Kitchenham_B_Guidelines_for_performing_Systematic_Literature_Reviews_in_software_engineering_EBSE_Technical_Report_EBSE-2007-01","258010581_Exploring_the_effects_of_Collaboration_Scripts_embedded_in_a_Distributed_Pair_Programming_System","234787563_Assessing_the_effectiveness_of_distributed_pair_programming_for_an_online_informatics_curriculum","228818416_Virtual_teaming_Experiments_and_experiences_with_distributed_pair_programming","228662477_Saros_An_eclipse_plug-in_for_distributed_party_programming","225130266_Virtual_Teaming_Experiments_and_Experiences_with_Distributed_Pair_Programming","224141514_A_conversation_model_of_collaborative_pair_programming_based_on_languageaction_theory","222827396_Empirical_studies_of_agile_software_development_A_systematic_review","222408325_The_effectiveness_of_pair_programming_A_meta-analysis","221592865_Support_for_Distributed_Pair_Programming_in_the_Transparent_Video_Facetop","221553892_An_empirical_study_of_the_effects_of_personality_in_pair_programming_using_the_five-factor_model","221536782_The_effects_of_pair-programming_on_performance_in_an_introductory_programming_course","221107961_Sangam_A_distributed_pair_programming_plug-in_for_eclipse","221107956_Next-Generation_DPP_with_Sangam_and_Facetop","221051231_Collective_Programming_Making_End-User_Programming_More_Social","221016340_Using_Scrum_in_Distributed_Agile_Development_A_Multiple_Case_Study","220428096_Requirements_engineering_paper_classification_and_evaluation_criteria_A_proposal_and_a_discussion","220344245_How_Distribution_Affects_the_Success_of_Pair_Programming","220069353_Empirical_Studies_of_Pair_Programming_for_CSSE_Teaching_in_Higher_Education_A_Systematic_Literature_Review","48991588_Culture_in_Global_Software_Development_-_A_Weakness_or_Strength","26849635_Evaluating_the_Effects_of_Virtual_Pair_Programming_on_Students'_Achievement_and_Satisfaction","26442290_Improving_Learning_of_Programming_Through_E-Learning_by_Using_Asynchronous_Virtual_Pair_Programming","4274135_Issues_and_Tactics_when_Adopting_Pair_Programming_A_Longitudinal_Case_Study","2859132_Exploring_the_Efficacy_of_Distributed_Pair_Programming","277072162_Extreme_Programming_Explained_Embrace_Change_2nd_Edition","261451018_Distributed_Side-by-Side_Programming","257559875_An_empirically_based_terminology_and_taxonomy_for_global_software_engineering","256992016_A_groupware_system_to_support_collaborative_programming_Design_and_experiences","251967039_Efficacy_of_distributed_pair_programming","232637919_A_Preliminary_Design_of_Distributed_Pair_Programming_System","232622385_Compatibility_and_Requirements_Analysis_of_Distributed_Pair_Programming","224138139_Measuring_the_Effects_of_Virtual_Pair_Programming_in_an_Introductory_Programming_Java_Course","224094270_A_Framework_of_Distributed_Pair_Programming_System","222614751_Empirical_evaluation_of_distributed_pair_programming","221592379_How_to_Build_Support_for_Distributed_Pair_Programming","221538044_On_preparing_students_for_distributed_software_development_with_a_synchronous_collaborative_development_platform","221537472_Successful_and_unsuccessful_problem_solving_approaches_of_novice_programmers","221368536_Pair_programming_as_a_teaching_tool_a_student_review_of_empirical_studies","221368135_Investigating_student-instructor_interactions_when_using_pair_programming_An_empirical_study","221159041_Analyzing_Work_Productivity_and_Program_Quality_in_Collaborative_Programming","220841064_Extending_the_Pair_Programming_Pedagogy_to_Support_Remote_Collaborations_in_CS_Education","220807837_A_distance_learning_approach_to_teaching_eXtreme_programming","220807572_A_development_environment_for_distributed_synchronous_collaborative_programming","220807336_Student_performance_in_CS1_with_distributed_pair_programming","220542323_Global_software_development_in_practice_lessons_learned","220349756_Understanding_Tools_and_Practices_for_Distributed_Pair_Programming","220094607_Problems_encountered_by_novice_pair_programmers","4365453_Coding_Dojo_An_Environment_for_Learning_and_Sharing_Agile_Practices","4034539_Lessons_learned_about_distributed_pair_programming_What_are_the_knowledge_needs_to_address","3247713_Global_software_development"]}
