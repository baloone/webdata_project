{"id":"301463522_PILeT_an_Interactive_Learning_Tool_To_Teach_Python","abstract":"This paper describes a planned investigation into how learning styles and pedagogical methodologies can be embedded into an e-learning tool to assist students' learning programming. The objective of the research is to test the hypothesis that combining multiple teaching methods to accommodate different learners' preferences will significantly improve comprehension of concepts, which in turn increases students' confidence and as a consequence performance in programming. An interactive learning tool to teach Python programming language to students, called PILeT, has been developed to test the hypothesis. The tool aims to be adaptable to the students' learning style and as such it will teach programming using several techniques (e.g. visual, textual, puzzles) to appeal to each preference. PILeT is suitable for secondary school students or teachers wishing to undertake CPD (Continuing Professional Development). PILeT will be tested on first year undergraduate students at Oxford Brookes University.","authors":["Bedour Alshaigy","Samia Kamal","Faye Mitchell","Clare Martin"],"meta":["November 2015","DOI:10.1145/2818314.2818319","Conference: the Workshop in Primary and Secondary Computing Education"],"references":["262160581_Parson's_programming_puzzles_A_fun_and_effective_learning_tool_for_first_programming_courses","228403640_Index_of_Learning_Styles_Questionnaire","221538525_Backstop_A_tool_for_debugging_runtime_errors","220808194_A_study_of_the_difficulties_of_novice_programmers","220808062_Wu's_Castle_Teaching_arrays_and_loops_in_a_game","220807692_Self-efficacy_and_mental_models_in_learning_to_program","304486093_Backstop_a_tool_for_debugging_runtime_errors","271452021_Wu's_castle","262294706_Online_python_tutor_Embeddable_web-based_program_visualization_for_cs_education","220807196_Combining_multiple_pedagogies_to_boost_learning_and_enthusiasm","220141058_E-Learning_personalization_based_on_hybrid_recommendation_strategy_and_learning_style_identification","30975393_Grand_Challenges_in_Computing_Education--A_Summary","4104888_Learning_style_and_factors_contributing_to_success_in_an_introductory_computer_science_course"]}
