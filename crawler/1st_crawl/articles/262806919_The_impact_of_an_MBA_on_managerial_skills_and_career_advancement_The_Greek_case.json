{"id":"262806919_The_impact_of_an_MBA_on_managerial_skills_and_career_advancement_The_Greek_case","abstract":"The present study attempts to offer some insights into the contribution of an accredited MBA program on graduates' skills, employability and career advancement in Greece. In addition, the current findings are compared to those of a twin survey conducted in 2006to test MBA ‘value’ under contrasting labor market conditions. The findings indicate that an MBA contributes considerably to most of the managerial skills, although relevant criticisms regarding a gap between MBA programs and business needs are not groundless. The MBA also helps graduates to find enriched jobs with increasing compensation over time. On the other hand, it exerts moderate to negligible influence on the selection/hiring process, job hopping and promotions. Contrasting the 2006 survey with the current one, it is found that an MBA degree tends to enhance graduates' careers in both economic boom and decline periods.","authors":["Dimitrios Mihail","Panagiotis V.
