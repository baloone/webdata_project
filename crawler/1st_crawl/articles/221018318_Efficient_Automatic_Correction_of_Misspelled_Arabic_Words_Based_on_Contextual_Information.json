{"id":"221018318_Efficient_Automatic_Correction_of_Misspelled_Arabic_Words_Based_on_Contextual_Information","abstract":"We address in this paper a new method aiming to reduce the number of proposals given by automatic Arabic spelling correction\ntools. We suggest the use of error’s context in order to eliminate some correction candidates. Context will be nearby words\nand can be extended to all words in the text. We present here experimentations we performed to validate some hypotheses we\nmade. Then we detail the method itself. Finally we describe the experimental protocol we used to evaluate the method’s efficiency.\nOur method was tested on a corpus containing genuine errors and has yielded good results. The average number of proposals\nhas been reduced by about 75% (from 16.8 to 3.98 proposals on average).","authors":["Chiraz Ben Othmane Zribi","Mohamed Ben Ahmed"],"meta":["September 2003Lecture Notes in Computer Science 2773:770-777","DOI:10.1007/978-3-540-45224-9_104","SourceDBLP","Conference: Knowledge-Based Intelligent Information and Engineering Systems, 7th International Conference, KES 2003, Oxford, UK, September 3-5, 2003, Proceedings, Part I"],"references":["220708273_Spelling_Correction_in_Agglutinative_Languages","2714080_Discrimination_Decisions_for_100000-Dimensional_Spaces","2710497_Spelling_Correction_in_Agglutinative_Languages","2370562_Towards_a_Single_Proposal_in_Spelling_Correction","220566331_Techniques_for_Automatically_Correcting_Words_in_Text"]}
