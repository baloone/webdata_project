{"id":"325304346_Leveraging_the_nonuniform_PSO_network_model_as_a_benchmark_for_performance_evaluation_in_community_detection_and_link_prediction","abstract":"Advances in network geometry pointed out that structural properties observed in networks derived from real complex systems can emerge in the hyperbolic space (HS). The nonuniform popularity-similarity-optimization (nPSO) is a generative model recently introduced in order to grow random geometric graphs in the HS, reproducing networks that have realistic features such as high clustering, small-worldness, scale-freeness and rich-clubness, with the additional possibility to control the community organization. Generative models allowing to tune the structural properties of 'realistic' synthetic networks are fundamental, because they offer a ground truth to investigate how predictive algorithms react to controlled topological variations. Here, we discuss how to leverage the nPSO model as a synthetic benchmark to compare the performance of methods for community detection and link prediction; and we prove that the nPSO offers a reliable and realistic testing framework which can complement other existing benchmarks not based on latent geometry. Furthermore, we confirm that network embedding information can improve community detection, whereas boosting link prediction in HS still needs further investigations. Indeed, we find that the presence of communities in nPSO significantly modifies the performance of link predictors and is fundamental for the reproducibility of results observed on real networks. The nPSO can trigger valuable insights to understand the intrinsic rules of link-growth and self-organization that connect topology to geometry and that are encoded in link prediction algorithms differentiating their performance.","authors":["Alessandro Muscoloni","Carlo Vittorio Cannistraci"],"meta":["May 2018New Journal of Physics 20(6)","DOI:10.1088/1367-2630/aac6f9"],"references":["321169172_Machine_learning_meets_complex_networks_via_coalescent_embedding_in_the_hyperbolic_space","318670936_A_nonuniform_popularity-similarity_optimization_nPSO_model_to_efficiently_generate_realistic_complex_networks_with_communities","313465896_Emergent_Hyperbolic_Network_Geometry","311692022_A_perturbation-based_framework_for_link_prediction_via_non-negative_matrix_factorization","333115533_A_Comparative_Analysis_of_Community_Detection_Algorithms_on_Artificial_Networks","322950629_Minimum_curvilinear_automata_with_similarity_attachment_for_network_embedding_and_link_prediction_in_the_hyperbolic_space","318814170_Local-ring_network_automata_and_the_impact_of_hyperbolic_geometry_in_complex_network_link-prediction","316595706_Pioneering_topological_methods_for_network-based_drug-target_prediction_by_exploiting_a_brain-network_self-organization_theory","312544727_The_geometric_nature_of_weights_in_real_complex_networks","305780197_Community_detection_in_networks_A_user_guide","305779642_A_Comparative_Analysis_of_Community_Detection_Algorithms_on_Artificial_Networks","304270363_Link_Prediction_via_Matrix_Completion","304812412_Hidden_geometric_correlations_in_real_multiplex_networks","297723765_Hyperbolic_mapping_of_complex_networks_based_on_community_information","291043454_The_hidden_geometry_of_weighted_complex_networks"]}
