{"id":"260409751_Trust_Based_Secure_on_Demand_Routing_Protocol_TSDRP_for_MANETs","abstract":"Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) are collections of mobile nodes that can communicate with one another using multihop wireless links. MANETs are often deployed in the environments, where there is no fixed infrastructure and centralized management. The nodes of mobile ad hoc networks are susceptible to compromise. In such a scenario, designing an efficient, trustworthy and secure routing protocol has been a major challenge over the last many years. In this paper, we propose a Trust Based Secure On Demand Routing Protocol called \"TSDRP\" for MANETs. Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol has been modified to implement TSDRP for making it secure to thwart attacks like Blackhole attack and DoS attack. To evaluate the performances, we have considered Packet Delivery Fraction (PDF), Average Throughput (AT) and Normalized Routing Load (NRL).","authors":["Nirbhay Chaubey","Savita Gandhi","Akshai Aggarwal","Keyurbhai A.
