{"id":"3084526_Polyphase_Codes_with_Good_Nonperiodic_Correlation_Properties","abstract":"N -phase Codes are described which have an autocorrelation function with one main peak and very small side peaks. With N phases an N^{2} long pulse sequence is generated. Properties have been verified for N up to 8 and a rule for main peak-to-side-peak ratio is conjectured for larger N . For N greater than 5 . the ratio is substantially better than the best ratios which have been shown for binary bipolar codes. Doppler shift effects appear to be similar to those of linear FM radar pulse compression.","authors":["Robert L.
