{"id":"321730814_On_the_competition_of_two_conflicting_messages","abstract":"There are plenty of conflicting messages in online social networks. This paper addresses the competition of two conflicting messages. Based on a novel individual-level competing spreading model (the generic UABU model), three criteria for one or two messages to terminate are presented. These criteria manifest the influence of the two message-spreading networks on the evolution of the two messages. Extensive computer simulations show that when a message terminates, the dynamics of a simplified UABU model (the linear UABU model) fits well with the expected evolutionary process of the message. These findings help in understanding the competing spreading process of two conflicting messages.","authors":["Lu-Xing Yang","Li Pengdeng","Xiaofan Yang","Yingbo Wu"],"meta":["February 2018Nonlinear Dynamics 91(6)","DOI:10.1007/s11071-017-3986-z"],"references":["315416576_On_the_Optimal_Dynamic_Control_Strategy_of_Disruptive_Computer_Virus","336976591_Probability_Markov_Chains_Queues_and_Simulation_The_Mathematical_Basis_of_Performance_Modeling","331457553_Probability_Markov_Chains_Queues_and_Simulation_The_Mathematical_Basis_of_Performance_Modeling","318811341_A_Bi-Virus_Competing_Spreading_Model_with_Generic_Infection_Rates","314472202_Competing_Opinions_and_Stubbornness_Connecting_Models_to_Data","313175219_SIHR_rumor_spreading_model_in_social_networks","311565555_Dynamic_malware_containment_under_an_epidemic_model_with_alert","309659276_The_impact_of_patch_forwarding_on_the_prevalence_of_computer_virus_A_theoretical_assessment_approach","309174114_A_sword_with_two_edges_Propagation_studies_on_both_positive_and_negative_information_in_online_social_networks","304660810_Heterogeneous_virus_propagation_in_networks_a_theoretical_study_LX_YANG_M_DRAIEF_AND_X_YANG"]}
