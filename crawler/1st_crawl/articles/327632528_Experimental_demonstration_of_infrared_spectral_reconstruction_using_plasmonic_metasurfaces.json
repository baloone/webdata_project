{"id":"327632528_Experimental_demonstration_of_infrared_spectral_reconstruction_using_plasmonic_metasurfaces","abstract":"We computationally reconstruct short- to long-wave infrared spectra using an array of plasmonic metasurface filters. We illuminate the filter array with an unknown spectrum and measure the optical power transmitted through each filter with an infrared microscope to emulate a filter-detector array system. We then use the recursive least squares method to determine the unknown spectrum. We demonstrate our method with light from a blackbody. We also demonstrate it with spectra generated by passing the light from the blackbody through various materials. Our approach is a step towards miniaturized spectrometers spanning the short- to long-wave infrared based on filter-detector arrays.","authors":["Benjamin Craig","Vivek Shrestha","Jiajun Meng","Jasper Cadusch"],"meta":["September 2018Optics Letters 43(18):4481","DOI:10.1364/OL.43.004481"],"references":["312341023_Etalon_Array_Reconstructive_Spectrometry","309006982_Experimental_Demonstration_of_Adaptive_Infrared_Multispectral_Imaging_using_Plasmonic_Filter_Array","235401435_Thermal_tuning_of_mid-infrared_plasmonic_antenna_arrays_using_a_phase_change_material","318448974_Quality_assessment_of_pharmaceutical_tablet_samples_using_Fourier_transform_near_infrared_spectroscopy_and_multivariate_analysis","312155553_Mid-wave_infrared_narrow_bandwidth_guided_mode_resonance_notch_filter","310839397_Infrared_spectroscopy_and_spectroscopic_imaging_in_forensic_science","303779469_On-chip_near-infrared_spectroscopy_of_CO2_using_high_resolution_plasmonic_filter_array","302982554_Compact_spectrometer_system_based_on_a_gradient_grating_period_guided-mode_resonance_filter","279729938_A_colloidal_quantum_dot_spectrometer","257991095_High-accuracy_midinfrared_450_cm-1_o_4000_cm-1_refractive_index_values_of_silicon"]}
