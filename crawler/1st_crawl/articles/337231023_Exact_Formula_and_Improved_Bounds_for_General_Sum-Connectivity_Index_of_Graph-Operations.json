{"id":"337231023_Exact_Formula_and_Improved_Bounds_for_General_Sum-Connectivity_Index_of_Graph-Operations","abstract":"For a molecular graph Γ, the general sum-connectivity index is defined as χβ(Γ) = Σvw∈E(Γ) [dΓ(v)+dΓ(w)]β, where β ∈ R and dΓ(v) denotes the degree of the vertex v in the molecular graph Γ. The problem of finding best possible upper and lower bound for certain topological index is of fundamental nature in extremal graph theory. Akhtar and Imran J. Inequal. Appl. (2016) 241 obtained the sharp bounds of general sum-connectivity index for four graph operations (F-sum graphs) introduced by Eliasi and Taeri Discrete Appl. Math. 157: 794-803, 2009). In this paper, for Γ ∈ N; we figured out and improved the sharp bounds of the general sum-connectivity index for F-sum graphs, where F ∈ {R,Q,T} Several examples are presented to elaborate and compare the results of improved bounds with existing sharp bounds. In addition, we obtained exact formula of general sum-connectivity index for F-sum graphs, when F = S.","authors":["Maqsood Ahmad","Muhammad Saeed","Muhammad Javaid","Muhammad Hussain"],"meta":["November 2019IEEE Access PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2953338","Projects: Neutrosophic Hypersoft SetsTopological Invariant and bounds of graphs"],"references":["321774956_On_the_bounds_of_degree-based_topological_indices_of_the_Cartesian_product_of_F-sum_of_connected_graphs","313689142_General_sum-connectivity_index_general_product-connectivity_index_general_Zagreb_index_and_coindices_of_line_graph_of_subdivision_graphs","309721690_The_sharp_bounds_on_general_sum-connectivity_index_of_four_operations_on_graphs","282791723_On_Zagreb_Indices_and_Coindices","280136936_The_Zagreb_Indices_30_Years_After","332587810_Computing_First_General_Zagreb_Index_of_Operations_on_Graphs","297477116_The_first_Zagreb_indices_30_years_after","296913786_General_Sum-Connectivity_Index_with_alpha_1_for_Bicyclic_Graphs","288058896_The_Zagreb_indices_of_four_operations_on_graphs","278720198_On_the_general_sum-connectivity_index_of_connected_unicyclic_graphs_with_pendant_vertices"]}
