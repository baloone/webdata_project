{"id":"282351734_Offloading_in_Software_Defined_Network_at_Edge_with_Information_Asymmetry_A_Contract_Theoretical_Approach","abstract":"The proliferation of highly capable mobile devices such as smartphones and\ntablets has significantly increased the demand for wireless access. Software\ndefined network (SDN) at edge is viewed as one promising technology to simplify\nthe traffic offloading process for current wireless networks. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the incentive problem in SDN-at-edge of how to motivate a third\nparty access points (APs) such as WiFi and smallcells to offload traffic for\nthe central base stations (BSs). The APs will only admit the traffic from the\nBS under the precondition that their own traffic demand is satisfied. Under the\ninformation asymmetry that the APs know more about own traffic demands, the BS\nneeds to distribute the payment in accordance with the APs' idle capacity to\nmaintain a compatible incentive. First, we apply a contract-theoretic approach\nto model and analyze the service trading between the BS and APs. Furthermore,\nother two incentive mechanisms: optimal discrimination contract and linear\npricing contract are introduced to serve as the comparisons of the anti adverse\nselection contract. Finally, the simulation results show that the contract can\neffectively incentivize APs' participation and offload the cellular network\ntraffic. Furthermore, the anti adverse selection contract achieves the optimal\noutcome under the information asymmetry scenario.","authors":["Yanru Zhang","Lanchao Liu","Yunan Gu","Dusit Niyato"],"meta":["May 2016Journal of Signal Processing Systems 83(2)","DOI:10.1007/s11265-015-1038-9"],"references":["269272358_Exploring_Social_Ties_for_Enhanced_Device-to-Device_Communications_in_Wireless_Networks","261447757_An_SDN-Based_Network_Architecture_for_Extremely_Dense_Wireless_Networks","313629843_Cisco_Visual_Networking_Index_Global_Mobile_Data_Traffic_Forecast_Update_2014-2019","313426269_Evolution_and_challenges_of_software_defined_networking","292252868_LTE_the_UMTS_long_term_evolution_from_theory_to_practice","269298417_Hybrid_data_pricing_for_network-assisted_user-provided_connectivity","269298285_Enabling_crowd-sourced_mobile_Internet_access","262287871_SoftRAN_Software_defined_radio_access_network","261447912_Evolution_and_Challenges_of_Software_Defined_Networking","261263095_Scalable_On-Demand_Network_Management_Module_for_Software_Defined_Telecommunication_Networks","261262989_Softwarization_of_Future_Networks_and_Services_-Programmable_Enabled_Networks_as_Next_Generation_Software_Defined_Networks","260346142_Cooperative_Spectrum_Sharing_A_Contract-Based_Approach","261262987_Software_Networks_at_the_Edge_A_Shift_of_Paradigm","261155256_Economics_of_mobile_data_offloading","260635462_An_Integrated_Contract_and_Auction_Design_for_Secondary_Spectrum_Trading"]}
