{"id":"22218843_Sex_and_the_Single_Hemisphere_Specialization_of_the_Right_Hemisphere_for_Spatial_Processing","abstract":"Specialization of the right hemisphere for spatial processing was studied in 200 normal boys and girls between 6 and 13 years\nof age. Boys performed in a manner consistent with right hemisphere specialization as early as the age of 6. Girls showed\nevidence of bilateral representation until the age of 13. The results suggest a sexual dimorphism in the neural organization\nunderlying cognition during a major period of childhood. The results, which have implications for reading instruction, are\ndiscussed in terms of a possible sex difference in neural plasticity during development and the clinical consequences of such\na difference.","authors":["D F Witelson"],"meta":["August 1976Science 193(4251):425-27","DOI:10.1126/science.935879","SourcePubMed"],"references":["284566136_Interhemispheric_differences_in_the_localization_of_psychological_processes_in_man","273753986_Developmental_Aphasia_and_Brain_Damage","272860899_Cerebral_Hemispheric_Asymmetry_in_Humans","247507744_Cultural_and_Physiological_Influences_Upon_Spatial-Perceptual_Processes_in_West_Africa_Part_II","246266281_Functional_Asymmetry_of_the_Brain_in_Dichotic_Listening","242851703_A_Sex_Difference_in_Effect_of_Temporal-Lobe_Neurosurgery_on_Design_Preference","238276659_Multiple_Range_and_Multiple_F-Test","232561722_The_Use_of_Factor_Scores_from_the_Wechsler-Bellevue_Scale_of_Intelligence_in_Assessing_Patients_with_Temporal_Lobe_Removals","229882450_Neural_lateralization_of_vocal_control_in_a_passerine_bird_II_Subsong_calls_and_a_theory_of_vocal_learning","223838907_VMH_lesions_and_reactivity_to_electric_footshock_in_the_rat_The_effect_of_early_testosterone_level","223120679_Perceptual_learning_and_the_theory_of_word_perception","223111926_The_ontogeny_of_brain_lateralization_for_speech_and_nonspeech_stimuli","22046837_Cerebral_speech_lateralization_in_young_children","18983401_Tactile_perception_of_direction_and_number_in_patients_with_unilateral_cerebral_disease","18945783_Sex-Dependent_Behavioral_Effects_of_Cerebral_Cortical_Lesions_in_the_Developing_Rhesus_Monkey","18528226_Sex-dependent_and_sex-independent_neural_control_of_reactivity_to_electric_footshock_in_the_rat","18511568_Dominance_of_the_minor_hemisphere_in_commissurotomized_man_on_a_test_of_figural_unification","18471086_The_relation_between_cerebral_speech_laterally_and_spatial_ability_with_special_reference_to_sex_and_hand_preference","18456362_Effect_of_neurosurgery_on_the_ability_to_identify_popular_word_associations","18424872_Laterality_of_Childhood_Hemiplegia_and_the_Growth_of_Speech_and_Intelligence","18390267_Sex_Differences_in_Cerebral_Processing_of_Visuospatial_Tasks","18372311_Tactile_perception_of_direction_in_normal_subjects_Implications_for_hemispheric_cerebral_dominance","18372102_Left_hemisphere_specialization_for_language_in_the_newborn_Neuroanatomical_evidence_of_asymmetry","18347845_Levels_of_impairment_of_sensori-motor_functions_in_children_with_early_brain_damage","18311102_The_functional_asymmetry_of_Braille_letter_learning_in_normal_sighted_children","18133102_Right-hemisphere_superiority_in_tactile_pattern-recognition_after_cerebral_commissurotomy_Evidence_for_nonverbal_memory","18011537_Superiority_of_the_Minor_Hemisphere_in_Commissurotomized_Man_for_the_Perception_of_Part-Whole_Relations","18005374_Functional_asymmetry_in_reading_of_Braille","17802164_Spatial_location_in_the_left_and_right_visual_fields","17741550_Development_of_Dichotic_and_Monaural_Hearing_Abilities_in_Young_Children","17647405_Cerebral_processing_of_nonverbal_sounds_in_boys_and_girls","17383236_The_influence_of_spatial_disorders_in_impairing_tactual_discrimination_of_shapes","17383232_Thresholds_for_pressure_and_sharpness_in_the_right_and_left_hands","9713965_Specific_developmental_disorders_of_speech_in_childhood","9669284_Developmental_changes_in_tactual_threshold_on_dominant_and_nondominant_sides","9597053_Hemiplegia_of_early_onset_and_the_faculty_of_speech_with_special_reference_to_the_effects_of_hemispheretomy","9517416_Speech_lateralization_in_young_children_as_determined_by_auditory_test","9312182_An_experimental_study_of_the_placebo_response_under_three_different_situations_of_pain","6090002_Ontogeny_of_Bird_Song"]}
