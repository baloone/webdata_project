{"id":"220271409_Notes_on_Triangular_Sets_and_Triangulation-Decomposition_Algorithms_I_Polynomial_Systems","abstract":"This is the first in a series of two tutorial articles devoted to triangulation-decomposition algorithms. The value of these\nnotes resides in the uniform presentation of triangulation-decomposition of polynomial and differential radical ideals with\ndetailed proofs of all the presented results. We emphasize the study of the mathematical objects manipulated by the algorithms\nand show their properties independently of those. We also detail a selection of algorithms, one for each task. We address\nhere polynomial systems and some of the material we develop here will be used in the second part, devoted to differential\nsystems.","authors":["Evelyne Hubert"],"meta":["January 2001Lecture Notes in Computer Science","DOI:10.1007/3-540-45084-X_1","SourceDBLP","Conference: Symbolic and Numerical Scientific Computation, Second International Conference, SNSC 2001, Hagenberg, Austria, September 10-11, 2001, Revised Papers"],"references":["240102887_Machine_Proofs_in_Geometry_Automated_Production_of_Readable_Proofs_for_Geometry_Theorems","221564504_Solving_Parametric_Algebraic_Systems","220806333_Ritt-Wu's_Decomposition_Algorithm_and_Geometry_Theorem_Proving","344668916_Machine_Proofs_in_Geometry_Automated_Production_of_Readable_Proofs_for_Geometry_Theorems","344551719_Computational_Methods_in_Commutative_Algebra_and_Algebraic_Geometry","319395414_Mechanical_Geometry_Theorem-Proving_Mechanical_Geometry_Problem-Solving_and_Polynomial_Equations-Solving","298875755_Notes_on_triangular_sets_and_triangulation-decomposition_algorithms_-_II_Differential_systems","282615455_The_Differential_Ideal_P_M","265371995_On_the_Decision_Problem_and_the_Mechanization_of_Theorem-Proving_in_Elementary_Geometry","265365903_Mathematics_mechanization_Mechanical_geometry_theorem-proving_mechanical_geometry_problem-solving_and_polynomial_equations-solving","264945958_Modern_Computer_Algebra","248984775_Historians_and_educationists_the_history_of_education_as_a_field_of_study_in_post-war_England_Part_I_1945-72","247321950_Quelques_applications_de_l''evaluation_dynamique","243074639_Manifolds_of_Functions_Defined_by_Systems_of_Algebraic_Differential_Equations","243069369_Book_Review_Differential_Equations_from_the_Algebraic_Standpoint","243000020_Specifications_des_algorithmes_de_triangulation_de_systemes_algebro-elementaires","242983252_On_the_links_between_triangular_sets_and_dynamic_constructible_closure","242804500_Weak_Wu_Stratification_in_R_n","242570785_Grsbner_bases_-_a_computational_approach_to_commutative_algebra","242505554_Commutative_Algebra_with_a_View_Toward_Algebraic_Geometry","242473898_Computational_Methods_in_Commutative_Algebra_and_Algebraic_Geometry","239641989_Diverses_questions_relatives_au_calcul_formel_avec_des_nombres_algbriques","237572030_A_first_course_to_D7_with_examples","222738684_Solving_zero-dimensional_algebraic_systems","222604610_A_Generalized_Euclidean_Algorithm_for_Computing_Triangular_Representations_of_Algebraic_Varieties","222529300_Factorization-free_Decomposition_Algorithms_in_Differential_Algebra","222467774_On_the_Theories_of_Triangular_Sets","222304991_Triangular_Sets_for_Solving_Polynomial_Systems_a_Comparative_Implementation_of_Four_Methods","222266471_A_new_method_for_solving_algebraic_systems_of_positive_dimension","221564756_On_the_Greatest_Common_Divisor_of_Polynomials_which_Depend_on_a_Parameter","221564031_On_Computer-assisted_Classification_of_Coupled_Integrable_Equations","221521222_About_a_New_Method_for_Computing_in_Algebraic_Number_Fields","221420467_Polynomial_Gcd_Computations_over_Towers_of_Algebraic_Extensions","220693130_Mechanical_Theorem_Proving_in_Geometries_Basic_Principles","220691080_Algorithms_for_Computer_Algebra","220537645_Resolvent_Representation_for_Regular_Differential_Ideals","220532115_Triviality_and_Dimension_of_a_System_of_Algebraic_Differential_Equations","220271401_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","220162120_An_Elimination_Method_for_Polynomial_Systems","220162083_Computing_Triangular_Systems_and_Regular_Systems","220161779_Decomposing_Polynomial_Systems_into_Simple_Systems","220161348_Unmixed-dimensional_Decomposition_of_a_Finitely_Generated_Perfect_Differential_Ideal","220161338_Real_Solving_for_Positive_Dimensional_Systems","220160830_The_Differential_Ideal_P_M","220160667_Algorithmic_Properties_of_Polynomial_Rings","210231864_Mechanical_Geometry_Theorem_Proving","200018953_Differential_Equations_from_the_Algebraic_Standpoint","46958155_Grobner_Bases_a_Computational_Approach_to_Commutative_Algebra","42092708_Triangularisation_De_Systemes_Constructibles_Application_A_L'evaluation_Dynamique","41106963_Computing_Canonical_Representatives_of_Regular_Differential_Ideals","41106962_Computing_representations_for_radicals_of_finitely_generated_differential_ideals","41106961_Representation_for_the_radical_of_a_finitely_generated_differential_ideal","36993086_Differential_Algebra_and_Algebraic_Groups","29617074_Pgcd_de_deux_polynomes_a_parametres_approche_par_la_cloture_constructible_dynamique_et_generalisation_de_la_methode_de_SA_Abramov_KYu_Kvashenko","15453417_Cognitive_functions_in_migraine_without_aura_between_attacks_A_psychophysiological_approach_using_the_oddball_paradigm"]}
