{"id":"283633971_The_Ocean_Platform_Engineering_Design_Challenge_Flooded_With_Stem_Content_and_Practices","abstract":"Since the release of the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), teachers have been working to integrate engineering content and practices with teaching science and math concepts. The Ocean Platform Engineering Design Challenge was tested during a professional development program for elementary teachers, secondary science teachers, and science faculty from over 80 school districts and four universities, and it was implemented with 160 students. Because the NGSS have raised engineering design to the same substantive level as scientific inquiry, one of the goals of the program was to enhance inquiry-based teaching by helping educators properly integrate engineering content and practices into their classrooms (NGSS Lead States 2013).","authors":["Tyler S.
