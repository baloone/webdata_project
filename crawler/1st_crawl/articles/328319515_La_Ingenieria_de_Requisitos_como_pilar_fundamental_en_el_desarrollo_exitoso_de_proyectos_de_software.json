The need to perform this process properly is covered, the concepts related to it, the activities comprising Requirements Engineering and tasks that make up each activity in the framework of this process are discussed. With the analysis of the specific needs and characteristics presented by the productive activity of the aforementioned Department, it is proposed to adjust activities and tasks within them, belonging to Requirements Engineering order to achieve the successful completion of the projects in this entity. The project time length estimation was made taking in account the given specifications corresponding to roles and years of experience. The result obtained is a guide for making Requirement Engineering in the Software Development Department's projects, and with its appliance, the previous situation of the department was reverted.","authors":["Ivette Barrientos","Lenna Carballo Mu√±oz"],"meta":["October 2016"],"references":["319653010_Ingenieria_de_Requisitos_en_Aplicaciones_para_la_Web_Un_estudio_Comparativo","233819114_System_Requirements_Engineering","319394075_The_Mythical_Man-Month","220690863_Software_Requirements_Analysis_and_Specification","2263328_Requirements_Engineering_as_the_Reconciliation_of_Technical_and_Social_Issues"]}
