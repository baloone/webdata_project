{"id":"236935869_Immune_networks_Multitasking_capabilities_near_saturation","abstract":"Pattern-diluted associative networks were introduced recently as models for\nthe immune system, with nodes representing T-lymphocytes and stored patterns\nrepresenting signalling protocols between T- and B-lymphocytes. It was shown\nearlier that in the regime of extreme pattern dilution, a system with $N_T$\nT-lymphocytes can manage a number $N_B!=!\\order(N_T^\\delta)$ of B-lymphocytes\nsimultaneously, with $\\delta!<!1$. Here we study this model in the extensive\nload regime $N_B!=!\\alpha N_T$, with also a high degree of pattern dilution, in\nagreement with immunological findings. We use graph theory and statistical\nmechanical analysis based on replica methods to show that in the\nfinite-connectivity regime, where each T-lymphocyte interacts with a finite\nnumber of B-lymphocytes as $N_T\\to\\infty$, the T-lymphocytes can coordinate\neffective immune responses to an extensive number of distinct antigen invasions\nin parallel. As $\\alpha$ increases, the system eventually undergoes a second\norder transition to a phase with clonal cross-talk interference, where the\nsystem's performance degrades gracefully. Mathematically, the model is\nequivalent to a spin system on a finitely connected graph with many short\nloops, so one would expect the available analytical methods, which all assume\nlocally tree-like graphs, to fail. Yet it turns out to be solvable. Our results\nare supported by numerical simulations.","authors":["Elena Agliari","Alessia Annibale","Adriano Barra","A. C. C.
