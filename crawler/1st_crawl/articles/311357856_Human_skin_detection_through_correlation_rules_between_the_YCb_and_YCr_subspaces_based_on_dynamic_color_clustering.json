{"id":"311357856_Human_skin_detection_through_correlation_rules_between_the_YCb_and_YCr_subspaces_based_on_dynamic_color_clustering","abstract":"This paper presents a novel rule-based skin detection method that works in the YCbCr color space. The method is based on correlation rules that evaluate the combinations of chrominance values to identify the skin pixels in the YCb and YCr subspaces. The correlation rules depend on the shape and size of dynamically generated skin color clusters, which are computed on a statistical basis in the YCb and YCr subspaces for each single image, and represent the areas that include most of the candidate skin pixels. Comparisons with six well-known rule-based methods in literature carried out on four publicly available databases show that the proposed method outperforms the others in terms of quantitative performance evaluation parameters. Moreover, the qualitative analysis shows that the method achieves satisfactory results also in critical scenarios, including severe variations in illumination conditions.","authors":["Nadia Brancati","Giuseppe De Pietro","Maria Frucci","Luigi Gallo"],"meta":["February 2017Computer Vision and Image Understanding 155:33-42","DOI:10.1016/j.cviu.2016.12.001"],"references":["306095941_A_novel_approach_for_face_detection_using_hybrid_skin_color_model","304112139_Comparison_of_Demographics_Tumor_Characteristics_and_Survival_Between_Pancreatic_Adenocarcinomas_and_Pancreatic_Neuroendocrine_Tumors_A_Population-based_Study","296677609_A_New_Pixel-Based_Quality_Measure_for_Segmentation_Algorithms_Integrating_Precision_Recall_and_Specificity","283185121_Comparative_Study_of_Skin_Color_Detection_and_Segmentation_in_HSV_and_YCbCr_Color_Space","276412348_Evaluation_From_precision_recall_and_F-measure_to_ROC_informedness_markedness_correlation","271742737_A_Robot_Learns_the_Facial_Expressions_Recognition_and_FaceNon-face_Discrimination_Through_an_Imitation_Game","263441846_Gesture_Recognition_in_Ego-Centric_Videos_using_Dense_Trajectories_and_Hand_Segmentation","262236625_A_dynamic_threshold_approach_for_skin_segmentation_in_color_images","262201613_A_Sequential_Classifier_for_Hand_Detection_in_the_Framework_of_Egocentric_Vision","259042862_Visual_Focus_of_Attention_in_Non-calibrated_Environments_using_Gaze_Estimation","258033115_Spatial-based_skin_detection_using_discriminative_skin-presence_features","257694177_Dynamic_approach_for_real-time_skin_detection","257627625_Hand_tracking_and_gesture_recognition_system_for_human-computer_interaction_using_low-cost_hardware","256436558_Posture_independent_model_for_hand_detection_and_tracking","228625716_Increase_reliability_for_skin_detector_using_backprobgation_neural_network_and_heuristic_rules_based_on_YCbCr","224606815_Color-based_and_context-aware_skin_detection_for_online_video_annotation","221572134_An_adaptive_multiple_model_approach_for_fast_content-based_skin_detection_in_on-line_videos","220845268_Skin_Paths_for_Contextual_Flagging_Adult_Videos","220050081_Recall_or_precision-oriented_strategies_for_binary_classification_of_skin_pixels","8103235_Skin_Segmentation_Using_Color_Pixel_Classification_Analysis_and_Comparison","4045277_Human_skin_color_clustering_for_face_detection","3308029_Face_segmentation_using_skin-color_map_in_videophone_applications","3193394_Face_detection_in_color_images","2882163_Statistical_Color_Models_with_Application_to_Skin_Detection","344876631_Real-Time_Hand_Gesture_Detection_and_Recognition_Using_Bag-of-Features_and_Support_Vector_Machine_Techniques","311589103_Dynamic_clustering_for_skin_detection_in_YCbCr_color_space","311366265_Color-Based_and_Context-Aware_Skin_Detection_for_Online_Video_Annotation","308818686_Hardware_implementation_for_a_hand_recognition_system_on_FPGA","308630043_Skin_detection_and_segmentation_in_color_images","305400521_A_novel_Face_Recognition_System_based_on_Skin_detection_HMM_and_LBP","286576360_Robust_Hand_Detection_and_Tracking_Based_on_Monocular_Vision","283772927_Adaptive_Skin_Color_Model_to_Improve_Video_Face_Detection","279544477_Human_skin_color_detection_A_review_on_neural_network_perspective","276452685_Hybrid_Human_Skin_Detection_Using_Neural_Network_and_K-Means_Clustering_Technique","272424087_Robust_Skin_Detection_in_Real-World_Images","271555101_Luminance_adapted_skin_color_modeling_for_the_robust_detection_of_skin_areas","263660437_Posture_Independent_Model_for_Hand_Detection_and_Tracking","261371259_Image_skin_segmentation_based_on_multi-agent_learning_Bayesian_and_neural_network","261276849_Pixel-Level_Hand_Detection_in_Ego-centric_Videos","256994013_Compressed_domain_based_pornographic_image_recognition_using_multi-cost_sensitive_decision_trees","237078352_Skin_Detection_and_Segmentation_in_Color_Images","236145651_Improved_Hand_Tracking_System","224165753_Spectral_Regression_based_age_determination","222816908_Objective_evaluation_of_approaches_of_skin_detection_using_ROC_analysis","222540346_A_survey_of_skin-color_modeling_and_detection_methods","222505001_A_novel_method_for_automatic_face_segmentation_facial_feature_extraction_and_tracking","222415712_A_skin_tone_detection_algorithm_for_an_adaptive_approach_to_steganography","222320848_A_Real-Time_Approach_to_the_Spotting_Representation_and_Recognition_of_Hand_Gestures_for_Human-Computer_Interaction","220119459_A_novel_fuzzy_facial_expression_recognition_system_based_on_facial_feature_extraction_from_color_face_images","3424457_A_Robust_Finger_Tracking_Method_for_Multimodal_Wearable_Computer_Interfacing","2696150_Facial_Feature_Extraction_In_Frontal_Views_Using_Biometric_Analogies"]}
