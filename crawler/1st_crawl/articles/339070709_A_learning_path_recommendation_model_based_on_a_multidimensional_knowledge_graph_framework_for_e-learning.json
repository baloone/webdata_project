{"id":"339070709_A_learning_path_recommendation_model_based_on_a_multidimensional_knowledge_graph_framework_for_e-learning","abstract":"E-learners face a large amount of fragmented learning content during e-learning. How to extract and organize this learning content is the key to achieving the established learning target, especially for non-experts. Reasonably arranging the order of the learning objects to generate a well-defined learning path can help the e-learner complete the learning target efficiently and systematically. Currently, knowledge-graph-based learning path recommendation algorithms are attracting the attention of researchers in this field. However, these methods only connect learning objects using single relationships, which cannot generate diverse learning paths to satisfy different learning needs in practice. To overcome this challenge, this paper proposes a learning path recommendation model based on a multidimensional knowledge graph framework. The main contributions of this paper are as follows. Firstly, we have designed a multidimensional knowledge graph framework that separately stores learning objects organized in several classes. Then, we have proposed six main semantic relationships between learning objects in the knowledge graph. Secondly, a learning path recommendation model is designed for satisfying different learning needs based on the multidimensional knowledge graph framework, which can generate and recommend customized learning paths according to the e-learnerâ€™s target learning object. The experiment results indicate that the proposed model can generate and recommend qualified personalized learning paths to improve the learning experiences of e-learners.","authors":["Daqian Shi","Ting Wang","Hao Xing","Hao Xu"],"meta":["February 2020Knowledge-Based Systems 195(5):105618","DOI:10.1016/j.knosys.2020.105618"],"references":["321120266_Recommendation_of_Learning_Path_Using_an_Improved_ACO_Based_on_Novel_Coordinate_System","319179230_Learning_path_recommendation_based_on_modified_variable_length_genetic_algorithm","308569189_Individualized_Learning_Path_Through_a_Services-Oriented_Approach","292177542_Rankings_Scientists_Journals_and_Countries_using_h-Index","284913582_An_Approach_of_Learning_Path_Sequencing_Based_on_Revised_Bloom's_Taxonomy_and_Domain_Ontologies_with_the_Use_of_Genetic_Algorithms","284709158_A_new_framework_of_concept_clustering_and_learning_path_optimization_to_develop_the_next-generation_e-learning_systems","257305821_Graph_theory_based_model_for_learning_path_recommendation","232646799_Interrater_reliability_The_kappa_statistic","229859997_Data_Mining_in_E-learning","220392767_Advanced_ontology_management_system_for_personalised_e-Learning","30531329_Faceted_Lightweight_Ontologies","322711269_Designing_and_Developing_a_Novel_Hybrid_Adaptive_Learning_Path_Recommendation_System_ALPRS_for_Gamification_Mathematics_Geometry_Course","321971181_A_Multi-Constraint_Learning_Path_Recommendation_Algorithm_Based_on_Knowledge_Map","318740919_Prerequisite_Relation_Learning_for_Concepts_in_MOOCs","318221754_Research_of_Learning_path_recommendation_algorithm_based_on_Knowledge_Graph","313843589_Building_an_Online_Adaptive_Learning_and_Recommendation_Platform","311317093_Optimizing_collaborative_learning_path_by_ant's_optimization_technique_in_e-learning_system","307999349_A_proposed_paradigm_for_smart_learning_environment_based_on_semantic_web","302580896_Learning_Concept_Graphs_from_Online_Educational_Data","301278538_A_Learner_Oriented_Learning_Recommendation_Approach_Based_on_Mixed_Concept_Mapping_and_Immune_Algorithm","288952492_Data_Mining_for_Contextual_Educational_Recommendation_and_Evaluation_Strategies","280855251_Personalized_Learning_Objects_Recommendation_based_on_the_Semantic-Aware_Discovery_and_the_Learner_Preference_Pattern","268695050_Creativity_in_scientific_teams_Unpacking_novelty_and_impact","262160656_Recommending_suitable_learning_scenarios_according_to_learners'_preferences_An_improved_swarm_based_approach","257926467_E-Learning_Strategies_for_Delivering_Knowledge_in_the_Digital_Age","257171657_Data_mining_for_providing_a_personalized_learning_path_in_creativity_An_application_of_decision_trees","236647685_Link_Recommendation_in_E-Learning_Systems_Based_on_Content-Based_Student_Profiles","227766135_Ontology-based_concept_map_for_planning_a_personalised_learning_path","223191504_Automatic_detection_of_learning_styles_for_an_e-learning_system","223020409_Chen_CM_Intelligent_Web-based_Learning_System_with_Personalized_Learning_Path_Guidance_Computers_Education_512_787-814","222995395_A_personalized_English_learning_recommender_system_for_ESL_students","222625005_Learning_to_learn_online_A_study_of_perceptual_changes_between_multiple_online_course_experiences","222203224_A_mining-based_approach_on_discovering_courses_pattern_for_constructing_suitable_learning_path","222147467_Advanced_ontology_management_system_for_personalised_e-Learning","220220121_Ontology_technology_to_assist_learners'_navigation_in_the_concept_map_learning_system","50590290_Adaptive_Course_Sequencing_for_Personalization_of_Learning_Path_Using_Neural_Network"]}
