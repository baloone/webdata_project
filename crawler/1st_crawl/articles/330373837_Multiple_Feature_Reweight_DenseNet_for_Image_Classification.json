{"id":"330373837_Multiple_Feature_Reweight_DenseNet_for_Image_Classification","abstract":"Recent network research has demonstrated that the performance of convolutional neural networks can be improved by introducing a learning block that capture spatial correlations. In this work, we propose a novel Multiple Feature Reweight DenseNet (MFR-DenseNet) architecture. The MFR-DenseNet improves the representation power of the DenseNet by adaptively recalibrating the channel-wise feature responses and explicitly modeling the interdependencies between the features of different convolutional layers. First, in order to perform dynamic channel-wise feature recalibration, we construct the Channel Feature Reweight DenseNet (CFR-DenseNet) by introducing the Squeeze-and-Excitation Module (SEM) to DenseNet. Then, to model the interdependencies between the features of different convolutional layers, we propose the Double Squeeze-and-Excitation Module (DSEM) and construct the Inter-Layer Feature Reweight DenseNet (ILFR-DenseNet). In the last step, we designed the MFR-DenseNet by combining the CFR-DenseNet and the ILFR-DenseNet, with an ensemble learning approach. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CFR-DenseNet, ILFR-DenseNet, and MFR-DenseNet. More importantly, the MFRDenseNet drops the error rate on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 by a large margin with significantly fewer parameters. Our 100-layer MFR-DenseNet (with 7.1M parameters) model achieves competitive results on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 data sets, with test errors 3.57% and 18.27% respectively, achieving a 4.5% relative improvement on CIFAR-10 and a 5.09% relative improvement on CIFAR-100 over the best result of DenseNet (with 27.2M parameters).","authors":["Ke Zhang","Yurong Guo","Xinsheng Wang","Jinsha Yuan"],"meta":["January 2019IEEE Access PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2890127"],"references":["329747614_CondenseNet_An_Efficient_DenseNet_Using_Learned_Group_Convolutions","321325862_CondenseNet_An_Efficient_DenseNet_using_Learned_Group_Convolutions","320179954_Pyramidal_RoR_for_Image_Classification","319770123_Densely_Connected_Convolutional_Networks","318255371_Dual_Path_Networks","308320871_Multi-Residual_Networks","306186068_Residual_Networks_of_Residual_Networks_Multilevel_Residual_Networks","305196650_Going_deeper_with_convolutions","303681812_Parametric_Exponential_Linear_Unit_for_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","301879329_Deep_Networks_with_Stochastic_Depth","284579051_Fast_and_Accurate_Deep_Network_Learning_by_Exponential_Linear_Units_ELUs","277411157_Deep_Learning","273397554_Variational_Bayesian_Matrix_Factorization_for_Bounded_Support_Data","266201822_Natural_Language_Processing_Almost_from_Scratch","261700625_Generic_Object_Detection_With_Dense_Neural_Patterns_and_Regionlets","220355039_The_Vanishing_Gradient_Problem_During_Learning_Recurrent_Neural_Nets_and_Problem_Solutions","50596072_Bayesian_Estimation_of_Beta_Mixture_Models_with_Variational_Inference","5583935_Learning_long-term_dependencies_with_gradient_descent_is_difficult","335353199_Fine-Grained_Age_Estimation_in_the_Wild_with_Attention_LSTM_Networks","329743809_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_with_Alternately_Updated_Clique","329740332_Non-local_Neural_Networks","329740202_Squeeze-and-Excitation_Networks","328767959_Short_Utterance_Based_Speech_Language_Identification_in_Intelligent_Vehicles_With_Time-Scale_Modifications_and_Deep_Bottleneck_Features","326139236_Variational_Bayesian_Learning_for_Dirichlet_Process_Mixture_of_Inverted_Dirichlet_Distributions_in_Non-Gaussian_Image_Feature_Modeling","325911704_Smart_and_Robust_Speaker_Recognition_for_Context-Aware_In-Vehicle_Applications","322672293_Parametric_Exponential_Linear_Unit_for_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","320971540_Aggregated_Residual_Transformations_for_Deep_Neural_Networks","320968593_Deep_Pyramidal_Residual_Networks","320968382_Xception_Deep_Learning_with_Depthwise_Separable_Convolutions","320964595_Residual_Attention_Network_for_Image_Classification","319770414_Identity_Mappings_in_Deep_Residual_Networks","319770272_Delving_Deep_into_Rectifiers_Surpassing_Human-Level_Performance_on_ImageNet_Classification","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","319501512_Squeeze-and-Excitation_Networks","312256274_Weighted_residuals_for_very_deep_networks","311609041_Deep_Residual_Learning_for_Image_Recognition","311430750_Deep_Pyramidal_Residual_Networks_with_Separated_Stochastic_Depth","308277201_Identity_Mappings_in_Deep_Residual_Networks","306281834_Rethinking_the_Inception_Architecture_for_Computer_Vision","304017613_Convolutional_Residual_Memory_Networks","303449354_Wide_Residual_Networks","301877036_Deep_Residual_Networks_with_Exponential_Linear_Unit","301874967_Inception-v4_Inception-ResNet_and_the_Impact_of_Residual_Connections_on_Learning","272194743_Batch_Normalization_Accelerating_Deep_Network_Training_by_Reducing_Internal_Covariate_Shift","269935358_Striving_for_Simplicity_The_All_Convolutional_Net","265385906_Very_Deep_Convolutional_Networks_for_Large-Scale_Image_Recognition","2402022_Indoor-Outdoor_Image_Classification"]}
