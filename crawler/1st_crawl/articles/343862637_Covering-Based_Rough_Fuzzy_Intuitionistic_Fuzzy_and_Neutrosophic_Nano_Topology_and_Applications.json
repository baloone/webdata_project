{"id":"343862637_Covering-Based_Rough_Fuzzy_Intuitionistic_Fuzzy_and_Neutrosophic_Nano_Topology_and_Applications","abstract":"In recent years, ''mathematical orientations on real-life problems'', which continue to increase, began to make a significant impact. Information systems for many decision-making problems consist of uncertain, incomplete, indeterminate and indiscernible structures and components. Classical set theory and interpretation methods fail to represent, express and solve the problems of these types or cause to make wrong decisions. For this reason, in this study, we provide definitions and methods to present information and problem representations in more detail and precision. This paper introduces three new topologies called covering-based rough fuzzy, covering-based rough intuitionistic fuzzy and covering-based rough neutrosophic nano topology. Some fundamental definitions such as open set, closed set, interior, closure and basis are given. Neutrosophic definitions and properties are mainly investigated. We give some real life applications of covering-based rough neutrosophic nano topology in the final part of the paper and an explanatory example of decision making application by defining core point.
