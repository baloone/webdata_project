{"id":"274729773_The_Early_Bird_Catches_The_Term_Combining_Twitter_and_News_Data_For_Event_Detection_and_Situational_Awareness","abstract":"Twitter updates now represent an enormous stream of information originating\nfrom a wide variety of formal and informal sources, much of which is relevant\nto real-world events. In this paper we adapt existing bio-surveillance\nalgorithms to detect localised spikes in Twitter activity corresponding to real\nevents with a high level of confidence. We then develop a methodology to\nautomatically summarise these events, both by providing the tweets which fully\ndescribe the event and by linking to highly relevant news articles. We apply\nour methods to outbreaks of illness and events strongly affecting sentiment. In\nboth case studies we are able to detect events verifiable by third party\nsources and produce high quality summaries.","authors":["Nicholas Thapen","Donal Simmie","Chris Hankin"],"meta":["October 2016Journal of Biomedical Semantics 7(1)","DOI:10.1186/s13326-016-0103-z","SourcearXiv"],"references":["319416663_Towards_Real-Time_Summarization_of_Scheduled_Events_from_Twitter_Streams","262697944_Real-Time_Detection_Tracking_and_Monitoring_of_Automatically_Discovered_Events_in_Social_Media","262367945_Geo-spatial_Event_Detection_in_the_Twitter_Stream","259355518_National_and_Local_Influenza_Surveillance_through_Twitter_An_Analysis_of_the_2012-2013_Influenza_Epidemic","308358300_Beyond_Trending_Topics_Real-_Event_Identification_on_Twitter","307881957_LIBSVM_A_library_for_support_vector_machines","286964622_Event_detection_via_communication_pattern_analysis","272623654_Libsvm","262221785_EvenTweet_Online_localized_event_detection_from_twitter","260495279_Using_Social_Media_to_Enhance_Emergency_Situation_Awareness"]}
