{"id":"280033798_On_vanishing_of_Kronecker_coefficients","abstract":"It is shown that:\n(1) The problem of deciding positivity of Kronecker coefficients is NP-hard.\n(2) There exists a positive ($\\# P$)-formula for a subclass of Kronecker\ncoefficients whose positivity is NP-hard to decide.\n(3) For any $0 < \\epsilon \\le 1$, there exists $0<a<1$ such that, for all\n$m$, there exist $\\Omega(2^{m^a})$ partition triples $(\\lambda,\\mu,\\mu)$ in the\nKronecker cone such that: (a) the Kronecker coefficient $k^\\lambda_{\\mu,\\mu}$\nis zero, (b) the height of $\\mu$ is $m$, (c) the height of $\\lambda$ is $\\le\nm^\\epsilon$, and (d) $|\\lambda|= |\\mu| \\le m^3$.\nThe last result takes a step towards proving the existence of\noccurrence-based representation-theoretic obstructions in the context of the\nGCT approach to the permanent vs. determinant problem. Its proof also\nillustrates the effectiveness of the explicit proof strategy of GCT.","authors":["Christian Ikenmeyer","Ketan Mulmuley","Michael Walter"],"meta":["July 2015","SourcearXiv"],"references":["232735823_Explicit_Lower_Bounds_via_Geometric_Complexity_Theory","45862596_An_overview_of_mathematical_issues_arising_in_the_Geometric_complexitytheory_approach_to_VP_vs_VNP","2140575_Coadjoint_orbits_moment_polytopes_and_the_Hilbert-Mumford_criterion","321350022_Inequalities_for_moment_cones_of_finite-dimensional_representations","277137102_Kronecker_coefficients_for_one_hook_shape","265353569_The_two-machine_flow_shop_problem_with_delays_and_the_one-machine_total_tardiness_problem","261144494_Representation_Theory_A_First_Course","257575623_Geometric_complexity_theory_III_On_deciding_nonvanishing_of_a_Littlewood-Richardson_coefficient","251239123_Plane_Partitions_and_Characters_of_the_Symmetric_Group","240233859_Semi-invariants_of_quivers_and_saturation_for_Littlewood-Richardson_coefficients","229334143_On_the_computational_complexity_of_reconstructing_three-dimensional_lattice_sets_from_their_two-dimensional_X-rays","227062515_Convexity_properties_of_the_moment_mapping_III","226489028_Geometric_invariant_theory_and_generalized_eigenvalue_problem","224775813_Padded_Polynomials_Their_Cousins_and_Geometric_Complexity_Theory","224709630_Computing_Multiplicities_of_Lie_Group_Representations","222355786_Sparse_complete_sets_for_NP_Solution_of_a_conjecture_of_Berman_and_Hartmanis","221591697_On_Isomorphisms_and_Density_of_NP_and_Other_Complete_Sets","220616622_A_Note_on_the_Sparse_Complete_Sets","220148531_On_the_reconstruction_of_binary_and_permutation_matrices_under_binary_tomographic_constraints","51940625_A_Study_of_the_representations_supported_by_the_orbit_closure_of_thedeterminant","46582555_Explicit_Proofs_and_The_Flip","45880157_Nonvanishing_of_Kronecker_coefficients_for_rectangular_shapes","7189971_On_the_Kronecker_product_of_irreducible_representations_of_the_symmetric_group","2476965_Positivity_Problems_and_Conjectures_in_Algebraic_Combinatorics","2140065_The_honeycomb_model_of_GLnC_tensor_products_I_Proof_of_the_saturation_conjecture","1957814_Geometric_Complexity_III_on_deciding_positivity_of_Littlewood-Richardson_coefficients","1866885_Geometric_Complexity_Theory_II_Towards_Explicit_Obstructions_for_Embeddings_among_Class_Varieties"]}
