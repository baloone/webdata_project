{"id":"3422921_Matplotlib_A_2D_Graphics_Environment","abstract":"Matplotlib is a 2D graphics package used for Python for application development, interactive scripting, and publication-quality image generation across user interfaces and operating systems. The latest release of matplotlib runs on all major operating systems, with binaries for Macintosh's OS X, Microsoft Windows, and the major Linux distributions. Matplotlib has a Matlab emulation environment called PyLab, which is a simple wrapper of the matplotlib API. Matplotlib provides access to basic GUI events such as button_press_event, mouse_motion_event and can also be registered with those events to receive callbacks. Event handling code written in matplotlib works across many different GUIs. It supports toolkits for domain specific plotting functionality that is either too big or too narrow in purpose for the main distribution. Matplotlib has three basic API classes, including, FigureCanvasBase, RendererBase and Artist.","authors":["John D.
