{"id":"354528336_Online_versus_Onsite_Teaching_Performance_Analysis_of_an_Introductory_Electrical_Circuit_Class","abstract":"Academia is adapting to the new age of online teaching and learning as the online mode has rapidly spread during the past several months. This is a significant paradigm shift and can also be viewed as an opportunity to think and experiment outside the box and question the traditional age-old ways of functioning in the onsite mode. As expected, there is continuous need and strong demand for innovative flexible online activities that promote learning. Currently, most academic institutions are in the process of either evaluating or implementing the new online options and tools for their programs. This paper compares the assessment data for online and onsite offerings of electrical circuit STEM classes during 2007-2021 and suggests that online mode is as good as or better than onsite mode. Future research areas are recommended that may contribute to understanding these trends and results in other areas of engineering and computer science.","authors":["Mohammad Amin","Bhaskar Raj Sinha","Pradip Dey"],"meta":["September 2021Asian Journal of Education and e-Learning 9(4)","DOI:10.24203/ajeel.v9i4.6689"],"references":["344631048_Impacts_of_the_COVID-19_Pandemic_on_Life_of_Higher_Education_Students_A_Global_Perspective","287498573_Student_Effort_Consistency_and_Online_Performance","254243665_Students'_experience_of_synchronous_learning_in_distributed_environments","239146620_A_dynamic_analysis_of_the_interplay_between_asynchronous_and_synchronous_communication_in_online_learning_The_impact_of_motivation","238767486_Asynchronous_and_synchronous_e-learning","271904845_Choosing_Between_Online_and_Face-to-Face_Courses_Community_College_Student_Voices","267996876_Formative_Assessment_in_Classrooms_Operational_Procedures","261540158_Dialogue_and_the_construction_of_knowledge_in_e-learning_Exploring_students'_perceptions_of_their_learning_while_using_Blackboard's_asynchronous_discussion_board","234669989_Learning_at_a_Distance_Undergraduate_Enrollment_in_Distance_Education_Courses_and_Degree_Programs_Stats_in_Brief_NCES_2012-154","222766369_Critical_factors_for_successful_delivery_of_online_programs","222698604_Evaluating_online_conversation_in_an_asynchronous_learning_environment_An_application_of_Grice's_cooperative_principle","44840198_Evaluation_of_Evidence-Based_Practices_in_Online_Learning_A_Meta-Analysis_and_Review_of_Online_Learning_Studies"]}
