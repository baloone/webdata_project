{"id":"278710954_Enhancing_Modeling_and_Change_Support_for_Process_Families_through_Change_Patterns","abstract":"The increasing adoption of process-aware information systems (PAISs), together with the variability of business processes (BPs), has resulted in large collections of related process model variants (i.e., process families). To effectively deal with process families, several proposals (e.g., C-EPC, Provop) exist that extend BP modeling languages with variability-specific constructs. While fostering reuse and reducing modeling efforts, respective constructs imply additional complexity and demand proper support for process designers when creating and modifying process families. Recently, generic and language independent adaptation patterns were successfully introduced for creating and evolving single BP models. However, they are not sufficient to cope with the specific needs for modeling and evolving process families. This paper suggests a complementary set of generic and language-independent change patterns specifically tailored to the needs of process families. When used in combination with existing adaptation patterns, change patterns for process families will enable the modeling and evolution of process families at a high-level of abstraction. Further, they will serve as reference for implementing tools or comparing proposals managing process families.","authors":["Clara Ayora","Victoria Torres","Barbara Weber","Manfred Reichert"],"meta":["January 2013Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing 147:246-260","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-38484-4_18","In book: Enterprise, Business-Process and Information Systems Modeling (pp.246-260)"],"references":["302924724_Guidelines_for_performing_Systematic_Literature_Reviews_in_Software_Engineering","268367061_Towards_Run-Time_Flexibility_for_Process_Families_Open_Issues_and_Research_Challenges","258968007_Kitchenham_B_Guidelines_for_performing_Systematic_Literature_Reviews_in_software_engineering_EBSE_Technical_Report_EBSE-2007-01","235949894_Workflow_Patterns","235949879_Managing_Large_Collections_of_Business_Process_Models_Current_Techniques_and_Challenges","229124837_Enabling_Flexibility_in_Process-Aware_Information_Systems_Challenges_Methods_Technologies","228725956_Organizational_reference_models_Supporting_an_adequate_design_of_local_business_processes","228718063_Workflow_resource_patterns","228609763_Context-based_configuration_of_process_variants","222690000_A_Configurable_Reference_Modelling_Language","221586308_Detecting_and_Resolving_Process_Model_Differences_in_the_Absence_of_a_Change_Log","221586037_Applying_Patterns_during_Business_Process_Modeling","221586014_Object-Sensitive_Action_Patterns_in_Process_Model_Repositories","221585986_IT_Support_for_Release_Management_Processes_in_the_Automotive_Industry","220989505_Dynamic_Computation_of_Change_Operations_in_Version_Management_of_Business_Process_Models","220920536_Workflow_Exception_Patterns","220831380_Change_Mining_in_Adaptive_Process_Management_Systems","47344440_Exception_Handling_Patterns_for_Process_Modeling","27472898_Questionnaire-based_Variability_Modeling_for_System_Configuration","267833711_Contextual_Injection_of_Quality_Measures_into_Software_Engineering_Processes","262174278_Towards_Business_Application_Product_Lines","248299486_Van_der_Workflow_Data_Patterns","236610480_Time_patterns_for_process-aware_information_systems","229124738_Configurable_Process_Models","223509876_Refactoring_large_process_model_repositories","222433832_Change_patterns_and_change_support_features_-_Enhancing_flexibility_in_process-aware_information_systems","221541894_Workflow_Change_Patterns_Opportunities_for_Extension_and_Reuse","221391552_Featuring_Automatic_Adaptivity_through_Workflow_Enactment_and_Planning","221281691_Flexible_Workflows_at_Design-_and_Runtime_Using_BPMN2_Adaptation_Patterns","220674062_Capturing_variability_in_business_process_models_the_Provop_approach","220351102_Mining_business_process_variants_Challenges_scenarios_algorithms","29529356_The_ADEPT_project_a_decade_of_research_and_development_for_robust_and_flexible_process_support"]}
