{"id":"329483027_Design_of_Data_Acquisition_System_Based_on_Zigbee_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","abstract":"With the continuous development of modern network technology, sensor technology and wireless communication technologies, the emergence and development of wireless sensor networks has been promoted. Among many wireless communication technologies, wireless communication technology featuring low power consumption, close proximity and low cost for ZigBee has attracted the research interest of researchers. Based on the current status of communication systems, based on the review and system analysis of wireless sensor networks, this paper proposes a ZigBee-based wireless sensor network data acquisition system, which avoids the reliability and installation of traditional wired sensor network data acquisition systems and shortcomings such as high maintenance costs and large wiring.","authors":["Shi Lei"],"meta":["January 2018MATEC Web of Conferences 246(1):03036","DOI:10.1051/matecconf/201824603036"],"references":["337295456_Research_and_Design_of_High_Speed_Data_Transmission_System_Based_on_PCIE"]}
