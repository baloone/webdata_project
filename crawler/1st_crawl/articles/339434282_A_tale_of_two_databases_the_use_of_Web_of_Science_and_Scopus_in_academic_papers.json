{"id":"339434282_A_tale_of_two_databases_the_use_of_Web_of_Science_and_Scopus_in_academic_papers","abstract":"Web of Science and Scopus are two world-leading and competing citation databases. By using the Science Citation Index Expanded and Social Sciences Citation Index, this paper conducts a comparative, dynamic, and empirical study focusing on the use of Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus in academic papers published during 2004 and 2018. This brief communication reveals that although both Web of Science and Scopus are increasingly used in academic papers, Scopus as a new-comer is really challenging the dominating role of WoS. Researchers from more and more countries/regions and knowledge domains are involved in the use of these two databases. Even though the main producers of related papers are developed economies, some developing economies such as China, Brazil and Iran also act important roles but with different patterns in the use of these two databases. Both two databases are widely used in meta-analysis related studies especially for researchers in China. Health/medical science related domains and the traditional Information Science and Library Science field stand out in the use of citation databases.","authors":["Junwen Zhu","Weishu Liu"],"meta":["February 2020Scientometrics 123(2)","DOI:10.1007/s11192-020-03387-8","Project: Characteristics and defects of bibliographic database(Web of Science/Scopus)"],"references":["338593920_Funding_information_in_Web_of_Science_An_updated_overview","335996587_The_data_source_of_this_study_is_Web_of_Science_Core_Collection_Not_enough","328294504_Google_Scholar_Web_of_Science_and_Scopus_A_systematic_comparison_of_citations_in_252_subject_categories","324984272_Trends_in_Russian_research_output_indexed_in_Scopus_and_Web_of_Science","324960718_The_application_of_bibliometric_analysis_disciplinary_and_user_aspects","332102350_The_secrets_behind_Web_of_Science's_DOI_search","329786025_DOI_errors_and_possible_solutions_for_Web_of_Science","328086527_The_research_trends_and_contributions_of_System's_publications_over_the_past_four_decades_1973-2017_A_bibliometric_analysis","328074628_Four_pitfalls_in_normalizing_citation_indicators_An_investigation_of_ESI's_selection_of_highly_cited_papers","327062044_Missing_author_address_information_in_Web_of_Science-An_explorative_study"]}
