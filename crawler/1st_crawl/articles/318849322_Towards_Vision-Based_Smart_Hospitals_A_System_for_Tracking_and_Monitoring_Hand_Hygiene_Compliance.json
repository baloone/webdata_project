{"id":"318849322_Towards_Vision-Based_Smart_Hospitals_A_System_for_Tracking_and_Monitoring_Hand_Hygiene_Compliance","abstract":"One in twenty-five patients admitted to a hospital will suffer from a hospital acquired infection. If we can intelligently track healthcare staff, patients, and visitors, we can better understand the sources of such infections. We envision a smart hospital capable of increasing operational efficiency and improving patient care with less spending. In this paper, we propose a non-intrusive vision-based system for tracking people's activity in hospitals. We evaluate our method for the problem of measuring hand hygiene compliance. Empirically, our method outperforms existing solutions such as proximity-based techniques and covert in-person observational studies. We present intuitive, qualitative results that analyze human movement patterns and conduct spatial analytics which convey our method's interpretability. This work is a first step towards a computer-vision based smart hospital and demonstrates promising results for reducing hospital acquired infections.","authors":["Albert Haque","Michelle Guo","Alexandre Alahi","Serena Yeung"],"meta":["August 2017"],"references":["262253272_Bagadus_An_integrated_system_for_arena_sports_analytics_-_A_soccer_case_study","258044802_Impact_of_Radio-Frequency_Identification_RFID_Technologies_on_the_Hospital_Supply_Chain_A_Literature_Review","257581899_SCOOP_A_Real-Time_Sparsity_Driven_People_Localization_Algorithm","304409005_RGB-W_When_Vision_Meets_Wireless","290689826_Smart_Hospital_based_on_Internet_of_Things","277895449_Spatial_Transformer_Networks","268516599_A_multi-sensor_fusion_system_for_moving_object_detection_and_tracking_in_urban_driving_environments","267960550_ImageNet_Classification_with_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","258640917_New_technologies_to_monitor_healhcare_worker_hand_hygiene","256378248_Health_Care-Associated_Infections_A_Meta-analysis_of_Costs_and_Financial_Impact_on_the_US_Health_Care_System"]}
