{"id":"220147129_A_Study_on_Secure_Data_Storage_Strategy_in_Cloud_Computing","abstract":"Based on fundamental theories of k equations in algebra, n congruence surplus principle in elementary number theory, and the Abhishek's online data storage algorithm, we propose a secure data storage strategy in cloud computing. The strategy splits data d into k sections using the data splitting algorithm, ensures high data security by simplifying k equation solutions, and at the same time, guarantees highly reliable data using the coefficients generated by the splitting algorithm.","authors":["Danwei Chen","Yanjun He"],"meta":["September 2010Journal of Convergence Information Technology 5(7):175-179","DOI:10.4156/jcit.vol5.issue7.23","SourceDBLP"],"references":["1959093_The_Cubic_Public-Key_Transformation","236157565_Error_Correction_Coding_Mathematical_Methods_and_Algorithms","222624982_New_efficient_and_practical_verifiable_multi-secret_sharing_schemes","222407819_Online_data_storage_using_implicit_security","220688555_The_Design_and_Analysis_Computer_Algorithms","220425267_How_to_Share_a_Secret","220147385_K-Grid_A_Structure_for_Storage_and_Retrieval_of_Affective_Knowledge","220147249_Anomaly_Detection_Analysis_of_Intrusion_Data_Using_Supervised_Unsupervised_Approach","200034374_The_Design_and_Analysis_of_Computer_Algorithms"]}
