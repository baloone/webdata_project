{"id":"286071811_A_survey_of_machine_learning_algorithms_for_big_data","abstract":"With the explosive growth of the industry data, more and more attention is paid to big data. However, due to the volume, complex and fast-changing characteristics of big data, traditional machine learning algorithms for small data are not applicable. Therefore, developing machine learning algorithms for big data is a research focus. In this paper, the state-of-the-art machine learning techniques for big data are introduced and analyzed. As parallelism is a mainstream strategy for applying machine learning algorithms to big data, some parallelism strategies are described in detail as well. Finally, the challenges of applying machine learning to big data and some interesting research trends of machine learning in big data are pointed out.","authors":["Qing He","N. Li","W.-J.
