{"id":"224825463_Computing_the_Discrete_Fr'echet_Distance_in_Subquadratic_Time","abstract":"The Fr\\'echet distance is a similarity measure between two curves $A$ and\n$B$: Informally, it is the minimum length of a leash required to connect a dog,\nconstrained to be on $A$, and its owner, constrained to be on $B$, as they walk\nwithout backtracking along their respective curves from one endpoint to the\nother. The advantage of this measure on other measures such as the Hausdorff\ndistance is that it takes into account the ordering of the points along the\ncurves.\nThe discrete Fr\\'echet distance replaces the dog and its owner by a pair of\nfrogs that can only reside on $n$ and $m$ specific pebbles on the curves $A$\nand $B$, respectively. These frogs hop from a pebble to the next without\nbacktracking. The discrete Fr\\'echet distance can be computed by a rather\nstraightforward quadratic dynamic programming algorithm. However, despite a\nconsiderable amount of work on this problem and its variations, there is no\nsubquadratic algorithm known, even for approximation versions of the problem.\nIn this paper we present a subquadratic algorithm for computing the discrete\nFr\\'echet distance between two sequences of points in the plane, of respective\nlengths $m\\le n$. The algorithm runs in $O(\\dfrac{mn\\log\\log n}{\\log n})$ time\nand uses $O(n+m)$ storage. Our approach uses the geometry of the problem in a\nsubtle way to encode legal positions of the frogs as states of a finite\nautomata.","authors":["Pankaj K.
