{"id":"318131485_Ubiquitous_and_Ambient_Intelligence_Assisted_Learning_Environment_Infrastructures_Development_-_a_review","abstract":"Ubiquitous Learning Environment (ULE) has been becoming a mobile and sensor based technology equipped environment that suits the modern world education discipline requirements for the past few years. Ambient Intelligence (AmI) makes much smarter the ULE by the support of optimization and intelligent techniques. Various efforts have been so far made as contributions to develop such smart environments. Hence a study is required to know the various smartness levels incorporated in those contributions. In this regard, first, a review on infrastructural developments for ubiquitous learning is reported in this article. Next, this report addresses various open issues, problems & requirements, technology challenges and potential improvements within the scope of Ubiquitous Learning Environment and Ambient Intelligence Assisted Learning Environment (AmIALE). It then also recommends an Internet-of-Things (IoT) enabled Ubiquitous Learning Environment for offering still smarter levels like energy efficiency, connectivity, special needs, Multi-modal Human Computer Interaction, Self-Optimization and Self-Discovery in an effective manner. We strongly believe that this work helps the researchers to start thinking in a different dimension to find solutions for various other current issues.","authors":["Sujith Kanagarajan","Sivakumar Ramakrishnan"],"meta":["January 2018Education and Information Technologies 23(1)","DOI:10.1007/s10639-017-9618-x"],"references":["317345612_FORTH-ICS_internal_RTD_Programme_'Ambient_Intelligence_and_Smart_Environments","317345501_Building_a_Multi-Touch_Display_Based_on_Computer_Vision_Techniques","308818276_Ubiquitous_computing_technologies_and_Context_Aware_Recommender_Systems_for_Ubiquitous_Learning","306200466_Youubi_Open_software_for_ubiquitous_learning","304338103_WebIntera-classroom_an_interaction-aware_virtual_learning_environment_for_augmenting_learning_interactions","304257519_Development_of_ontologies_for_modelling_user_behaviour_in_Ambient_Intelligence_environment","304257104_Towards_development_of_U-conferencing_facility_in_learning_management_system","303790837_The_Design_of_Augmented_Reality-Based_Learning_System_Applied_in_U-Learning_Environment","303693505_Exploring_the_effects_of_web-mediated_computational_thinking_on_developing_students'_computing_skills_in_a_ubiquitous_learning_environment","301741110_Development_and_application_of_a_repertory_grid-oriented_knowledge_construction_augmented_reality_learning_system_for_context-aware_ubiquitous_learning","301621199_Analyzing_Communication_Dimensions_in_a_Ubiquitous_Learning_Environment","293688806_ClassMATE_Enabling_ambient_intelligence_in_the_classroom","297891268_A_context-adaptive_teacher_training_model_in_a_ubiquitous_learning_environment","297736107_A_dynamic_ubiquitous_learning_resource_model_with_context_and_its_effects_on_ubiquitous_learning","294422419_Agent-based_modeling_of_collaborative_interaction_in_ubiquitous_learning_environment_using_local_dynamic_behavior"]}
