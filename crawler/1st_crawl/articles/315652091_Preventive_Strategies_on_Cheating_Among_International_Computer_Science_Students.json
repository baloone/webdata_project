{"id":"315652091_Preventive_Strategies_on_Cheating_Among_International_Computer_Science_Students","abstract":"The cases of plagiarism and cheating conducted by international students in Computer Science programs are analyzed. Motivational and cultural aspects of this misconduct have been studied, and preventive strategies have been developed and implemented successfully in some courses. Instead of traditional methods of plagiarism identification (e.g., by using the TurnitIn™ software to check for basic originality for submitted written work) and student’s punishment, the project-development in-class activities have been offered to the students by the course instructors, who promote using Lucidchart™ diagram-drawing tool in the Cloud environment. This approach allows them to see a history of the student’s work performed, as well as the contributors to the design repository.","authors":["Vladimir Riabov"],"meta":["March 2017","Project: Educational Research"],"references":[]}
