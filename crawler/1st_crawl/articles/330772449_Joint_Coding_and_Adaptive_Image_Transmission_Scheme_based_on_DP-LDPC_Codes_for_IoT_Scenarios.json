{"id":"330772449_Joint_Coding_and_Adaptive_Image_Transmission_Scheme_based_on_DP-LDPC_Codes_for_IoT_Scenarios","abstract":"For wireless image communication in Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios, fast and low error coding and transmission mechanisms are imperative. The joint source channel coding (JSCC) scheme based on double protograph low-density parity-check codes (DP-LDPC) would be a potential candidate due to the low complexity and good error performance. However, the error floor performance of DP-LDPC codes may deteriorate for source sequences with higher source probabilities or shorter block lengths. This work aims to improve the traditional DP-LDPC image transmission system for IoT scenarios from the following aspects: first, a joint optimization method of finite-length DP-LDPC codes is proposed to reduce the error floor while keeping satisfactory waterfall region performance; second, an improved rate allocation strategy based on the fuzzy logic control (FLC) is adopted to further improve the transmission reliability of the proposed short block length DP-LDPC codes. This scheme may offer some new solutions for IoT image communication; and the simulation results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.","authors":["Li Deng","Zhiping Shi","Jianbo Ji"],"meta":["January 2019IEEE Access PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2895368"],"references":["323096192_The_Design_of_Protograph_LDPC_Codes_as_Source_Codes_in_a_JSCC_System","322655498_A_Novel_Image_Encoding_and_Communication_Technique_of_BW_Images_for_IOT_Robotics_and_Drones_using_15_11_Reed_Solomon_Scheme","318471936_Low_Density_Generator_Matrix_LDGM-based_Raptor_codes_for_single_carrier_Internet_of_Things_SC-IoT","280858193_Matching_Criterion_Between_Source_Statistics_and_Source_Coding_Rate","261718841_Performance_of_Joint_Source-Channel_Coding_Based_on_Protograph_LDPC_Codes_over_Rayleigh_Fading_Channels","260733469_Unequal_error_protection_for_radiography_image_transmission_using_protograph_double_LDPC_codes","224172371_Joint_Source_and_Channel_Coding","6534346_LDPC-based_iterative_joint_source-channel_decoding_for_JPEG2000","3080322_Efficient_Encoding_of_Low-Density_Parity-Check_Codes","327922465_Social_Sensor_Cloud_Framework_Greenness_Issues_and_Outlook","325240384_Effective_adaptive_rate_allocation_for_DP-LDPC_image_transmission_system_based_on_source_and_channel_characteristics","323710529_Joint_Optimization_of_Protograph_LDPC_Code_Pair_for_Joint_Source_and_Channel_Coding","323156236_Trust-Based_Communication_for_the_Industrial_Internet_of_Things","321793071_Secure_Multimedia_Big_Data_in_Trust-Assisted_Sensor-Cloud_for_Smart_City","320981276_Performance_Analysis_and_Optimization_for_Edge_Connection_of_JSCC_System_Based_on_Double_Protograph_LDPC_Codes","310809891_An_image_pre-processing_approach_for_JSCC_scheme_based_on_double_protograph_LDPC_codes","308707271_Enhancing_security_in_IoT_based_Home_automation_using_Reed_Solomon_Codes","301316881_Performance_Improvement_of_JSCC_Scheme_Through_Redesigning_Channel_Code","293111616_Multi-edge_optimization_of_low-density_parity-check_codes_for_joint_source-channel_coding","284569088_Joint_Source_and_Channel_Coding","269269434_Design_of_non-precoded_protograph-based_LDPC_codes","236157543_Low_Density_Parity_Check_LDPC_Codes_Constructed_from_Protographs","220640384_Capacity-Approaching_Protograph_Codes","3085299_Regular_and_irregular_progressive_edge-growth_Tanner_graphs"]}
