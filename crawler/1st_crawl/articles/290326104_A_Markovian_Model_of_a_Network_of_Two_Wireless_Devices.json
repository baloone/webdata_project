{"id":"290326104_A_Markovian_Model_of_a_Network_of_Two_Wireless_Devices","abstract":"The authors present a Markovian queuing model of two wireless devices sharing a sending channel and its behavior during the work. The authors investigate some measures (that is: the average queue length, the system utilization and the probability of packet loss). To find these values we compute transient probabilities of all the states of a Markov chain with the use of uniformization method. The Markov chain represents a queuing model of a system of two devices mentioned above. The probabilities are used in some analytical formulas for the investigated measures.","authors":["Jaros≈Çaw Bylina","Beata Bylina","Marek Karwacki"],"meta":["June 2012","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-31217-5_43","Conference: International Conference on Computer Networks"],"references":["265282501_Performance_Analysis_of_the_IEEE_80211_Distributed_Coordination_Function_Bianchi_Model","289284204_A_CPU-GPU_Hybrid_Approach_to_the_Uniformization_Method_for_Solving_Markovian_Models_-_A_Case_Study_of_a_Wireless_Network","229354713_A_diffusion_approximation_model_for_wireless_networks_based_on_IEEE_80211_standard","226949335_A_Markovian_queuing_model_of_a_WLAN_node","224710599_Stochastic_Bounds_for_Loss_Rates","4080676_On_the_throughput_performance_of_CSMA-based_wireless_local_area_network_with_directional_antennas_and_capture_effect_A_cross-layer_analytical_approach","3234321_Performance_analysis_of_the_IEEE_80211_distributed_coordination_function"]}
