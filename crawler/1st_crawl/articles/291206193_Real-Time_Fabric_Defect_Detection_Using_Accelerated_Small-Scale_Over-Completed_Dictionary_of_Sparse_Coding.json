{"id":"291206193_Real-Time_Fabric_Defect_Detection_Using_Accelerated_Small-Scale_Over-Completed_Dictionary_of_Sparse_Coding","abstract":"An auto fabric defect detection system via computer vision is used to replace manual inspection. In this paper, we propose a hardware accelerated algorithm based on a small-scale over-completed dictionary (SSOCD) via sparse coding (SC) method, which is realized on a parallel hardware platform (TMS320C6678). In order to reduce computation, the image patches projections in the training SSOCD are taken as features and the proposed features are more robust, and exhibit obvious advantages in detection results and computational cost. Furthermore, we introduce detection ratio and false ratio in order to measure the performance and reliability of the hardware accelerated algorithm. The experiments show that the proposed algorithm can run with high parallel efficiency and that the detection speed meets the real-time requirements of industrial inspection.","authors":["Tianpeng Feng","Lian Zou","Jia Yan","Wenxuan Shi"],"meta":["January 2016International Journal of Advanced Robotic Systems 13(1):1","DOI:10.5772/62058"],"references":["302341151_Textural_Features_for_Image_Classification","273996940_An_efficient_hybrid_face_recognition_algorithm_using_PCA_and_GABOR_wavelets","273996879_An_Advanced_Approach_to_Extraction_of_Colour_Texture_Features_Based_on_GLCM","271560777_Improved_Gabor_filters_for_textile_defect_detection","241501372_Fabric_Defect_Detection_Using_Adaptive_Wavelet","226012417_Defect_detection_in_textile_fabric_images_using_wavelet_transforms_and_independent_component_analysis","270504122_Fabric_defect_detection_using_adaptive_dictionaries","262392723_Sparse_Dictionary_Reconstruction_for_Textile_Defect_Detection","258196560_Automatic_detection_system_for_printed_fabric_defects","236732989_Fabric_Defect_Detection_based_on_GLCM_and_Gabor_filter_A_Comparison"]}
