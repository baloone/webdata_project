{"id":"341565127_Data-Driven_Ohmic_Resistance_Estimation_of_Battery_Packs_for_Electric_Vehicles","abstract":"Accurate state-of-health (SOH) estimation for battery packs in electric vehicles (EVs) plays a pivotal role in preventing battery fault occurrence and extending their service life. In this paper, a novel internal ohmic resistance estimation method is proposed by combining electric circuit models and data-driven algorithms. Firstly, an improved recursive least squares (RLS) is used to estimate the internal ohmic resistance. Then, an automatic outlier identification method is presented to filter out the abnormal ohmic resistance estimated under different temperatures. Finally, the ohmic resistance estimation model is established based on the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) regression algorithm and inputs of temperature and driving distance. The proposed model is examined based on test datasets. The root mean square errors (RMSEs) are less than 4 mÎ© while the mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs) are less than 6%. The results show that the proposed method is feasible and accurate, and can be implemented in real-world EVs.","authors":["Kaizhi Liang","Zhaosheng Zhang","Peng Liu","Zhenpo Wang"],"meta":["December 2019Energies 12(24)","DOI:10.3390/en12244772"],"references":["336187386_Thermal_runaway_behavior_during_overcharge_for_large-format_Lithium-ion_batteries_with_different_packaging_patterns","331990949_Data-driven_prediction_of_battery_cycle_life_before_capacity_degradation","337065466_Battery_Aging_Assessment_for_Real-World_Electric_Buses_Based_on_Incremental_Capacity_Analysis_and_Radial_Basis_Function_Neural_Network","337016263_State_of_health_estimation_for_Li-Ion_battery_using_incremental_capacity_analysis_and_Gaussian_process_regression","335820077_Synchronous_multi-parameter_prediction_of_battery_systems_on_electric_vehicles_using_long_short-term_memory_networks","335391874_Data-driven_health_estimation_and_lifetime_prediction_of_lithium-ion_batteries_A_review","334842395_A_review_on_the_key_issues_of_the_lithium_ion_battery_degradation_among_the_whole_life_cycle","333565381_Fault_prognosis_of_battery_system_based_on_accurate_voltage_abnormity_prognosis_using_long_short-term_memory_neural_networks","333201529_In_situ_monitoring_of_lithium-ion_battery_degradation_using_an_electrochemical_model","331308279_Co-estimation_of_Capacity_and_State-of-Charge_for_Lithium-ion_Batteries_in_Electric_Vehicles"]}
