{"id":"280769621_Modelling_and_control_of_multi-risk_behaviours_using_probabilistic_discrete_event_systems","abstract":"In this paper, we introduce a new approach to model multiple social and health risk behaviours using probabilistic discrete event systems (PDES) for control and prevention. We develop a method to model the transition of individual risk behaviour as a PDES process. The parameters of the PDES model can be obtained from either longitudinal survey data or cross-sectional survey data. We then use parallel composition to combine the models for individual behaviours to establish PDES model for multi-risk behaviour. With the established PDES models, Mason's gain formula developed in engineering can be applied to investigate the impacts of control and prevention on multi-risk behaviours and to evaluate the effectiveness of control and prevention strategies.","authors":["Feng Lin","Xinguang Chen","Wen Chen"],"meta":["October 2014International Journal of Automation and Control 8(4):295","DOI:10.1504/IJAAC.2014.065452"],"references":["281747829_Does_Alcohol_Lead_to_Sexual_Risk_Behavior_Findings_from_Event-Level_Research","251396842_Supervisory_control_of_discrete_event_processes","225337608_Supervisory_Control_of_Discrete-Event_Systems","281747604_Does_alcohol_lead_to_sexual_risk_behavior_Findings_from_event-level_research","265409700_The_Control_of_Discrete_Event_Systems","233897157_The_Childhood_and_Society","233897152_Identity_and_The_Life_Cycle","232471030_Stages_of_Acquisition_and_Cessation_for_Adolescent_Smoking_An_Empirical_Integration","226858587_Child_Sexual_Abuse_Peer_Sexual_Abuse_and_Sexual_Assault_in_Adulthood_A_Multi-Risk_Model_of_Revictimization","222562168_Applying_the_Transtheoretical_Model_to_Regular_Moderate_Exercise_in_an_Overweight_Population_Validation_of_a_Stages_of_Change_Measure"]}
