{"id":"348111873_Digital_Libraries_and_the_Breakthrough_in_Linguistic_Chronologization_Application_of_Digitization_in_Linguistics","abstract":"Purpose/Thesis: The turn of the century marked a beginning of the dynamic growth of Polish digital libraries. The process had results beyond the increased accessibility of library resources. From the perspective of information science, a digital library has many functions aside from sharing its reso­urces; therefore, it is important that we attend to the role such libraries play in research conducted by scholars of different disciplines. Approach/Method: This article is a review. The authors briefly present the role of digital libraries in applied linguistics, primarily in linguistic chronologization, i.e dating and re-dating of neologisms, with a focus on twentieth-century Polish language. Results and conclusions: The analysis shows that the development of digital libraries was the con­dition sine qua non for establishing contemporary linguistic chronologization theory (which may be also considered to be a research method). The future growth of digital resources will allow the scholars to pose more plausible hypotheses regarding linguistic chronologization. Originality/Value: Linguistic chronologization theory (TLCH) often features in linguistics scholar­ship. As far as the authors know, no information science journal published a paper considering the role of digital libraries in applied linguistics.","authors":["Piotr Nowak","Piotr Wierzchoń"],"meta":["November 2020Zagadnienia Informacji Naukowej - Studia Informacyjne 58(1A(115A)):110-121","DOI:10.36702/zin.727"],"references":["326781253_Humanistyka_pracownia_centrum_czy_laboratorium"]}
