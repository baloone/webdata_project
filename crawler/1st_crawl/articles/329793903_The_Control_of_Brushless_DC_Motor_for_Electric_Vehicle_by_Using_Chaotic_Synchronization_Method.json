{"id":"329793903_The_Control_of_Brushless_DC_Motor_for_Electric_Vehicle_by_Using_Chaotic_Synchronization_Method","abstract":"Brushless DC motor (BLDC) used in electric vehicles can be operated in normal weather conditions and on straight roads, with chaotic dynamics of BLDC motor and high efficiency at a certain stable point. The dynamics of the BLDC motor applied on the electric car can be constantly changed according to the road conditions and wind speed. In this study, chaotic synchronization methods were developed to convert the BLDC motor into the desired reference chaotic dynamics. Synchronization method is developed based on sliding mode control (SMC), PI control and adaptive control methods. The artificial bee colony algorithm has been used to calculate the optimal values of the Kp and Ki coefficients of the PI controller. The numerical simulation results showing the performances of the controllers were obtained in MATLABSimulink environment. In order to better compare the performance of the controllers, the error performance indices have been provided according to these three control methods. All the three methods have shown that the chaotic based BLDC motor can be controlled, but sliding mode control method has proved to be a better performer.","authors":["Ercan KÃ¶se","Aydin Muhurcu"],"meta":["December 2018Studies in Informatics and Control 27(4)","DOI:10.24846/v27i4y201804"],"references":["313846212_Dynamical_Analysis_and_FPGA_Implementation_of_a_Novel_Hyperchaotic_System_and_Its_Synchronization_Using_Adaptive_Sliding_Mode_Control_and_Genetically_Optimized_PID_Control","312926600_Speed_Response_of_Brushless_DC_Motor_using_Fuzzy_PID_Controller_under_Varying_Load_Condition","309012634_Controller_design_by_using_non-linear_control_methods_for_satellite_chaotic_system","301277246_SYNCHRONIZATION_OF_GENESIO_AND_LU_CHAOTIC_DYNAMICAL_SYSTEMS_VIA_ACTIVE_CONTROL","259169741_Optimal_PID_control_of_a_brushless_DC_motor_using_PSO_and_BF_techniques","225392029_A_powerful_and_efficient_algorithm_for_numerical_function_optimization_Artificial_bee_colony_ABC_algorithm","316319713_A_simple_three-dimensional_fractional-order_chaotic_system_without_equilibrium_Dynamics_circuitry_implementation_chaos_control_and_synchronization","286394878_Second-Order_Sliding_Mode_Control_with_PI_Sliding_Surface_and_Experimental_Application_to_an_Electromechanical_Plant","275773416_Speed_control_of_Brushless_DC_motor_using_bat_algorithm_optimized_Adaptive_Neuro-Fuzzy_Inference_System","234014441_Synchronization_in_chaotic_systems"]}
