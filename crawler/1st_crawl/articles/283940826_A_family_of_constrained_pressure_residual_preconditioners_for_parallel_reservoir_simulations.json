{"id":"283940826_A_family_of_constrained_pressure_residual_preconditioners_for_parallel_reservoir_simulations","abstract":"Large-scale reservoir simulations are extremely time-consuming because of the solution of large-scale linear systems arising from the Newton or Newtonâ€“Raphson iterations. The problem becomes even worse when highly heterogeneous geological models are employed. This paper introduces a family of multi-stage preconditioners for parallel black oil simulations, which are based on the famous constrained pressure residual preconditioner. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our preconditioners are robust, efficient, and scalable.
