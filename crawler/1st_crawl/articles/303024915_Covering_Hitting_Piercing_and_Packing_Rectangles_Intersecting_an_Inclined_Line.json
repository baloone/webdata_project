{"id":"303024915_Covering_Hitting_Piercing_and_Packing_Rectangles_Intersecting_an_Inclined_Line","abstract":"We consider special cases of set cover, hitting set, piercing set, and independent set problems for axis-parallel squares and axis-parallel rectangles in the plane, where the objects are intersecting an inclined line or equivalently a diagonal line. We prove that for axis-parallel unit squares the hitting set and set cover problems are NP-complete, whereas the piercing set and independent set problems are in P. For axis-parallel rectangles, we prove that the piercing set problem is NP-complete, which solves an open question from Correa et al. [Discrete & Computational Geometry (2015) [3]]. Further, we give a nO(⌈logc⌉+1) time exact algorithm for the independent set problem with axis-parallel squares, where n is the number of squares and side lengths of the squares vary from 1 to c. We also prove that when the given objects are unit-height rectangles, both the hitting set and set cover problems are NP-complete. For the same set of objects, we prove that the independent set problem can be solved in polynomial time.","authors":["Supantha Pandit","Apurva Mudgal"],"meta":["December 2015","Conference: Combinatorial Optimization and Applications"],"references":[]}
