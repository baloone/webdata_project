{"id":"305553916_The_Death_and_Life_of_Great_American_Cities","abstract":"This chapter focuses on the issues in current city planning and rebuilding. It describes the principles and aims that have shaped modern, orthodox city planning and rebuilding. The chapter shows how cities work in real life, because this is the only way to learn what principles of planning and what practices in rebuilding can promote social and economic vitality in cities, and what practices and principles will deaden these attributes. In trying to explain the underlying order of cities, the author uses a preponderance of examples from New York. The most important thread of influence starts, more or less, with Ebenezer Howard, an English court reporter for whom planning was an avocation. Howard's influence on American city planning converged on the city from two directions: from town and regional planners on the one hand, and from architects on the other.","authors":["Jane Jacobs"],"meta":["January 2016","DOI:10.1002/9781119084679.ch4","In book: Readings in Planning Theory (pp.94-109)"],"references":[]}
