{"id":"305333213_A_Quality_Model_for_AAL_Software_Systems","abstract":"The Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) domain aims\nto support the daily life activities of elders, patients with\nchronic conditions or disabled people, with a focus on ICT\n(Informatics and Communication Technologies). Important\nadvances in AAL software systems have been already made,\nassisting people in their home, work, and social environments.\nBecause of their critical nature, these systems must be devel-\noped focused on their quality. Hence, quality attributes (QAs),\nsuch as safety, reliability, and security, must be identified\nand well defined to successfully achieve the system purposes.\nHowever, there is not a set of QAs specific for AAL systems;\nhence, new systems have been developed based on general\nstandards, such as ISO/IEC 25010, or based on particular\nexperiences. This paper introduces the QM4AAL, a quality\nmodel (QM) for AAL systems. The QM4AAL was established\nand evaluated based on evidence from several published works\nfound through conduction of a systematic mapping study. As\nresult, the QM4AAL details QAs requirements, adaptive (e.g.,\nself-configuring or situation-aware) or static properties, and\nstakeholders of AAL systems and their constituents systems\n(e.g., activity monitoring or health status monitoring systems).\nWe intend this QM can orient the design and assessment of\ncurrent and future AAL systems.","authors":["Lina Garc√©s","Flavio Oquendo","Elisa Yumi Nakagawa"],"meta":["June 2016","DOI:10.1109/CBMS.2016.46","Conference: 29th International Symposium on Computer-Based Medical SystemAt: BelfastVolume: 2016","Project: HomecARe: A reference architecture for healthcare supportive home systems from a systems-of-systems perspective"],"references":["299493620_Reference_Architecture_and_Product_Line_Architecture_A_Subtle_But_Critical_Difference","279160289_A_Strategic_Study_about_Quality_Characteristics_in_e-Health_Systems_Based_on_a_Systematic_Literature_Review","260556727_Ambient_Assisted_Living_Healthcare_Frameworks_Platforms_Standards_and_Quality_Attributes","253116994_Elicitation_of_Quality_Characteristics_for_AAL_Systems_and_Services","235725281_Tailoring_Software_Process_CapabilityMaturity_Models_for_the_Health_Domain","225654619_Service_quality_of_mHealth_platforms_Development_and_validation_of_a_hierarchical_model_using_PLS","224504045_Software_quality_models_Purposes_usage_scenarios_and_requirements","221000656_An_investigation_into_the_notion_of_non-functional_requirements","220520857_Self-adaptive_software_Landscape_and_research_challenges","205006851_AALIANCE_Ambient_Assisted_Living_Roadmap","309486707_Quality_attributes_and_quality_models_for_ambient_assisted_living_software_systems_A_systematic_mapping","300476669_A_Quality_Model_for_Service_Delivery_in_AAL_and_AT_Provision","273692840_A_Comparative_Analysis_of_Reference_Architectures_for_Healthcare_in_the_Ambient_Assisted_Living_Domain","256992048_Relevance_and_perspectives_of_AAL_in_Brazil","221187694_Evaluation_of_AAL_Platforms_According_to_Architecture-Based_Quality_Attributes","220757177_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","220068809_A_survey_on_situation-aware_ambient_intelligence_systems"]}
