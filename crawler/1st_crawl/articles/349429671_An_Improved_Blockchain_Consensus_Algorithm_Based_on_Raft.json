{"id":"349429671_An_Improved_Blockchain_Consensus_Algorithm_Based_on_Raft","abstract":"To address the problem of performance degradation caused by the blockchain backup mechanism as well as the high throughput and low latency requirements characteristic of blockchain applications, this paper optimizes the Raft consensus algorithm for the Hyperledger Fabric platform in terms of both log replication and leader election. In the log replication phase, the improvement of log replication based on apportionment idea aims to reduce the communication complexity of leader node by involving peer node in distributing log information. In the leader election phase, the improvement of leader election based on vote change mechanism changes the vote affiliation of peer node based on a comparison of votes from candidate nodes, aims to reach consensus in a round of election and reduces the election time. Through the performance test of the blockchain, it is demonstrated that the improved AdRaft algorithm improves 5.8% in throughput and reduces 1.3% in latency over the original Raft algorithm.","authors":["Wei Fu","Xuefeng Wei","Shihua Tong"],"meta":["February 2021","DOI:10.1007/s13369-021-05427-8"],"references":["335826741_Smart_Contract_Development_Adoption_and_Challenges_The_Powered_Blockchain","320362651_Algorand_Scaling_Byzantine_Agreements_for_Cryptocurrencies","311668722_Scalable_Byzantine_Consensus_via_Hardware-Assisted_Secret_Sharing","220851761_HQ_Replication_A_Hybrid_Quorum_Protocol_for_Byzantine_Fault_Tolerance","220439244_Practical_Byzantine_Fault_Tolerance_and_Proactive_Recovery","338940799_K-Bucket_Based_Raft-Like_Consensus_Algorithm_for_Permissioned_Blockchain","338728951_VBBFT-Raft_An_Understandable_Blockchain_Consensus_Protocol_with_High_Performance","312391505_In_search_of_an_understandable_consensus_algorithm","309451430_The_Honey_Badger_of_BFT_Protocols","224248727_Zab_High-performance_broadcast_for_primary-backup_systems","220851799_The_Chubby_Lock_Service_for_Loosely-Coupled_Distributed_Systems","2626811_The_Part-Time_Parliament","2554993_The_Byzantine_Generals_Problem"]}
