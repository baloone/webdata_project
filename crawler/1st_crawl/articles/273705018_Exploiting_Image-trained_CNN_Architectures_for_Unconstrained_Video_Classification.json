{"id":"273705018_Exploiting_Image-trained_CNN_Architectures_for_Unconstrained_Video_Classification","abstract":"We conduct an in-depth exploration of different strategies for doing event\ndetection and action recognition in videos using convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs) trained for image classification. We study different ways of performing\nframe calibration, spatial and temporal pooling, feature normalization, choice\nof CNN layer as well as choice of classifiers. Making judicious choices along\nthese dimensions led to a very significant increase in performance over more\nnaive approaches that have been used till now. We illustrate our procedure with\ntwo popular CNN architectures which got excellent results in the ILSVRC-2012\nand 2014 competitions. We test our methods on the challenging TRECVID MED'14\ndataset which contains a heterogeneous set of videos that vary in terms of\nresolution, quality, camera motion and illumination conditions. On this\ndataset, our methods, based entirely on image-trained CNN features, can already\noutperform state-of-the-art non-CNN models based on the best motion-based\nFisher vector approach. We further show that late fusion of CNN- and\nmotion-based features brings a tremendous improvement, increasing the mean\naverage precision (mAP) from 34.95% to 38.74%. The fusion approach also matches\nthe state-of-the-art classification performance on UCF-101 dataset.","authors":["Shengxin Zha","Florian Luisier","Walter D.
