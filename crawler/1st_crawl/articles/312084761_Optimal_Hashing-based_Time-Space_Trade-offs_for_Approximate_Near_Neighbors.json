{"id":"312084761_Optimal_Hashing-based_Time-Space_Trade-offs_for_Approximate_Near_Neighbors","abstract":"Our matching lower bounds are of two types: conditional and unconditional. First, we prove tightness of the whole trade-off (0.1) in a restricted model of computation, which captures all known hashing-based approaches. We then show unconditional cell-probe lower bounds for one and two probes that match (0.1) for œÅq = 0, improving upon the best known lower bounds from [PTW10]. In particular, this is the first space lower bound (for any static data structure) for two probes which is not polynomially smaller than the one-probe bound. To show the result for two probes, we establish and exploit a connection to locally-decodable codes.","authors":["Alexandr Andoni","Thijs Laarhoven","Ilya Razenshteyn","Erik Waingarten"],"meta":["January 2017","DOI:10.1137/1.9781611974782.4","Conference: Proceedings of the Twenty-Eighth Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms"],"references":["302569358_Lower_Bounds_on_Time-Space_Trade-Offs_for_Approximate_Near_Neighbors","301840852_Extensions_of_Lipschitz_mappings_into_a_Hilbert_space","301268073_New_directions_in_nearest_neighbor_searching_with_applications_to_lattice_sieving","300730103_Sieving_for_Shortest_Vectors_in_Lattices_Using_Angular_Locality-Sensitive_Hashing","284788387_Tradeoffs_for_nearest_neighbors_on_the_sphere","281670441_Practical_and_Optimal_LSH_for_Angular_Distance","261404541_A_Directed_Isoperimetric_Inequality_with_application_to_Bregman_Near_Neighbor_Lower_Bounds","224354136_A_Geometric_Approach_to_Lower_Bounds_for_Approximate_Near-Neighbor_Search_and_Partial_Match","221309648_Efficient_Exact_Set-Similarity_Joins","3593061_The_geometry_of_graphs_and_some_of_its_algorithmic_applications","312830320_On_Computing_Nearest_Neighbors_with_Applications_to_Decoding_of_Binary_Linear_Codes","312413341_A_Framework_for_Similarity_Search_with_Space-Time_Tradeoffs_using_Locality-Sensitive_Filtering","308847023_Probabilistic_Polynomials_and_Hamming_Nearest_Neighbors","306187674_Polynomial_Representations_of_Threshold_Functions_and_Algorithmic_Applications","301875019_Scalability_and_Total_Recall_with_Fast_CoveringLSH","301847145_Simple_average-case_lower_bounds_for_approximate_near-neighbor_from_isoperimetric_inequalities","300621759_Smooth_Tradeoffs_between_Insert_and_Query_Complexity_in_Nearest_Neighbor_Search","295686406_On_Data_Structures_and_Asymmetric_Communication_Complexity","282000259_Learning_to_Hash_for_Indexing_Big_Data_-_A_Survey","280104399_Tight_Lower_Bounds_for_Data-Dependent_Locality-Sensitive_Hashing","278048190_Neighborhood_Watch_Stochastic_Gradient_Descent_with_Neighbors","276458768_Finding_Correlations_in_Subquadratic_Time_with_Applications_to_Learning_Parities_and_the_Closest_Pair_Problem","270593463_Optimal_Data-Dependent_Hashing_for_Approximate_Near_Neighbors","264743116_Hashing_for_Similarity_Search_A_Survey","260349309_NNS_lower_bounds_via_metric_expansion_for_l_and_EM_D","240608255_Exponential_Lower_Bound_for_2Query_Locally_Decodable_Codes_via_a_Quantum_Argument","237077155_Beyond_Locality-Sensitive_Hashing","234829538_High-Dimensional_Computational_Geometry","225135324_Spherical_LSH_for_Approximate_Nearest_Neighbor_Search_on_Unit_Hypersphere","224354137_Hardness_of_Nearest_Neighbor_under_L-infinity","223415183_Cell-probe_lower_bounds_for_the_partial_match_problem","223115845_A_strong_lower_bound_for_approximate_nearest_neighbor_searching","222123852_Tighter_Lower_Bounds_for_Nearest_Neighbor_Search_and_Related_Problems_in_the_Cell_Probe_Model","221591327_Similarity_estimation_techniques_from_rounding_algorithms","221499834_Higher_Lower_Bounds_for_Near-Neighbor_and_Further_Rich_Problems","221499524_Multi-Index_Hashing_for_Information_Retrieval","221498692_On_the_Optimality_of_the_Dimensionality_Reduction_Method","221498260_Near-Optimal_Hashing_Algorithms_for_Approximate_Nearest_Neighbor_in_High_Dimensions","220779735_Dimensionality_reduction_techniques_for_proximity_problems","220617492_The_Fast_Johnson-Lindenstrauss_Transform_and_Approximate_Nearest_Neighbors","220616467_A_Randomized_Algorithm_for_Closest-Point_Queries","220574740_On_Approximate_Nearest_Neighbors_under_l_Norm","220424989_Near-Optimal_Hashing_Algorithms_for_Approximate_Nearest_Neighbor_in_High_Dimensions","220345439_An_Elementary_Proof_of_a_Theorem_of_Johnson_and_Lindenstrauss","220247721_Point_Location_in_Arrangements_of_Hyperplanes","220114134_Some_Principles_for_Dynamizing_Decomposable_Searching_Problems","215458558_Locality-sensitive_hashing_scheme_based_on_p-stable_distributions","4109370_An_Optimal_Randomised_Cell_Probe_Lower_Bound_for_Approximate_Nearest_Neighbour_Searching","2508382_An_elementary_proof_of_the_Johnson-Lindenstrauss_Lemma","2276972_Efficient_Search_for_Approximate_Nearest_Neighbor_in_High_Dimensional_Spaces","1958659_Lower_Bounds_on_Locality_Sensitive_Hashing"]}
