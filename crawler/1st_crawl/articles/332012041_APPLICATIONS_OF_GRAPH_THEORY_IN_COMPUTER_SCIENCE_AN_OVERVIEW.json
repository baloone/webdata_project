{"id":"332012041_APPLICATIONS_OF_GRAPH_THEORY_IN_COMPUTER_SCIENCE_AN_OVERVIEW","abstract":"The field of mathematics plays vital role in various fields. One of the important areas in mathematics is graph theory which is used in structural models. This structural arrangements of various objects or technologies lead to new inventions and modifications in the existing environment for enhancement in those fields. The field graph theory started its journey from the problem of Koinsberg bridge in 1735. This paper gives an overview of the applications of graph theory in heterogeneous fields to some extent but mainly focuses on the computer science applications that uses graph theoretical concepts. Various papers based on graph theory have been studied related toscheduling concepts, computer science applications and an overview has been presented here.","authors":["S G Shrinivas G SG Shrinivas S G Shrinivas","Santhakumaran Vetrivel","N M Elango"],"meta":["September 2010International Journal of Engineering Science and Technology 2(9)"],"references":["228627540_Graph-Based_and_Structural_Methods_for_Fingerprint_Classification","228608392_Clustering_of_web_documents_using_a_graph_model","3193287_Introduction_to_the_special_section_on_graph_algorithms_in_computer_vision","3049712_Constructing_a_Message-Pruning_Tree_with_Minimum_Cost_for_Tracking_Moving_Objects_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_Is_NP-Complete_and_an_Enhanced_Data_Aggregation_Structure","321009812_GRAPH_THEORY_WITH_APPLICATIONS_TO_ENGINEERING_AND_COMPUTER_SCIENCE","289747465_New_algorithm_for_analyzing_performance_of_neighborhood_strategies_in_solving_job_shop_scheduling_problems","260360281_Graph_Theory_With_Application_to_Engineering_and_Computer_Science","4125985_Connected_K-coverage_problem_in_sensor_networks","4110151_Automatic_channel_allocation_for_small_Wireless_Local_Area_networks_using_graph_colouring_algorithm_approach","3046711_A_Graph_Model_for_Fault-Tolerant_Computing"]}
