{"id":"336573106_Existence_and_Global_Exponential_Stability_of_Pseudo_Almost_Periodic_Solution_for_Clifford-_Valued_Neutral_High-Order_Hopfield_Neural_Networks_With_Leakage_Delays","abstract":"In this paper, we are concerned with a class of Clifford-valued neutral high-order Hopfield neural networks with leakage delays. Although the multiplication of Clifford numbers does not satisfy the commutativity, which brings great difficulties to the study of Clifford-valued systems, we have found a method that does not decompose Clifford-valued systems into real-valued systems to study the existence and global exponential stability of pseudo-almost periodic solutions of this class of neural networks. Our results are completely new. Finally, two examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness and feasibility of our main results.","authors":["Bing Li","Yongkun Li"],"meta":["October 2019IEEE Access 7:1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2947647"],"references":["335374562_Pseudo_almost_automorphic_solutions_of_quaternion-valued_neural_networks_with_infinitely_distributed_delays_via_a_non-decomposing_method","334465442_Existence_and_Global_Exponential_Stability_of_Almost_Automorphic_Solution_for_Clifford-Valued_High-Order_Hopfield_Neural_Networks_with_Leakage_Delays","333055083_Global_Asymptotic_Almost_Periodic_Synchronization_of_Clifford-Valued_CNNs_with_Discrete_Delays","328337474_Existence_and_global_exponential_stability_of_anti-periodic_solutions_for_delayed_quaternion-valued_cellular_neural_networks_with_impulsive_effects","325511631_Anti-periodic_Solutions_for_Quaternion-Valued_High-Order_Hopfield_Neural_Networks_with_Time-Varying_Delays","332999529_Existence_and_Exponential_Stability_of_Anti-Periodic_Solutions_for_Inertial_Quaternion-Valued_High-Order_Hopfield_Neural_Networks_With_State-Dependent_Delays","332665940_Globally_Asymptotic_Almost_Automorphic_Synchronization_of_Clifford-Valued_RNNs_With_Delays","330032108_Existence_and_global_exponential_stability_of_anti-periodic_solution_for_Clifford-valued_inertial_Cohen-Grossberg_neural_networks_with_delays","326781385_Almost_periodic_solutions_for_quaternion-valued_shunting_inhibitory_cellular_neural_networks_of_neutral_type_with_time_delays_in_the_leakage_term","324930797_The_global_exponential_pseudo_almost_periodic_synchronization_of_quaternion-valued_cellular_neural_networks_with_time-varying_delays"]}
