{"id":"223891035_Scientific_publishing_in_developing_countries_Challenges_for_the_future","abstract":"In this paper, I first refer to the center-periphery dichotomy in terms of scientific output, placing emphasis upon the relation that exists between science and technology development, on the one hand, and social and economic development, on the other. I then analyze the main problems faced by most peripheral journals and the role nation states play in scientific activities in developing countries. I then address issues such as the world power structures, the social organization of developing countries, growing North/South disparities and the question of collaborative research. The discursive (i.e., language related) and non-discursive problems faced by researchers in periphery countries and the main initiatives that have recently been taken to try to solve the stark disparities that exist in the world of scholarly publishing are also discussed. I finally present a proposal, the aim of which is to suggest ways that could help scientists in periphery countries become fully integrated members of the worldwide network of science and would also contribute to the promotion of scientific multilingualism, a means for science to be truly universal, as it should be. I conclude by arguing that science, technology and publication form a triad which is essential for the survival of developing nations, and that, although the complete elimination of inequities in the world of scholarship is unlikely, progress could be achieved if there were a universal will (i.e., a worldwide will at the institutional, governmental and intergovernmental levels) to redress the current North/South imbalance.","authors":["Fran√ßoise Salager-Meyer"],"meta":["April 2008Journal of English for Academic Purposes 7(2):121-132","DOI:10.1016/j.jeap.2008.03.009"],"references":["315697858_Linguistic_Imperialism","292639827_A_bird's_eye_view_of_science_publishing_and_editing_in_Iran","275905153_Good_Editorial_Practice_Editors_as_Educators","273984465_Languages_for_Specific_Purposes","264505887_Quality_Analysis_of_Journals_in_TESOL_and_Applied_Linguistics","261773442_The_impact_factor_revisited","260354231_Discourse_Community_Legitimate_Peripheral_Participation_and_the_Nonnative-English-Speaking_Scholar","259056309_Lost_Science_in_the_Third_World","256474159_Las_consecuencias_de_publicar_en_revistas_cientificas_escritas_en_Espanol_en_espana","255669551_Current_Perspectives_on_Teaching_World_Englishes_and_English_as_a_Lingua_Franca","254740169_TESOL_at_forty_what_are_the_issues","250310557_Raising_the_visibility_of_Small_Journals_The_Venezuelan_Association_of_Biomedical_Journal_Editors_-ASEREME-","249237929_Review_English-Only_Europe_Challenging_Language_Policy","242147291_English_in_the_geopolitics_of_knowledge","235342149_Research_Genres_Explorations_and_Applications","230895396_Cardiology_in_Brazilian_scientific_journals_An_overview","330660899_TheNative_Speaker_Myth_and_Reality","328725550_The_'other_English'_thoughts_on_EAP_and_academic_writing","292639491_The_Status_and_Function_of_English_in_Germany","292639435_Brazilian_scientific_journals_An_overview","292639314_English_Language_Standards_in_Academic_Articles_Attitudes_of_Peer_Reviewers","292639154_Looking_Globally_Seeing_Locally_Exploring_Some_Myths_of_Globalisation_in_Academia","292432972_English-Only_Europe_Challenging_Language_Policy","288034733_The_Dominance_of_English_as_a_Language_of_Science","288027300_Is_english_really_a_tyrannosaurus_rex","285192212_The_Languages_of_Science_in_France_Public_Debate_and_Language_Policies","283922812_The_metrics_of_the_physician_brain_drain","283918595_The_Dominance_of_English_as_a_Language_of_Science","281479389_Language_science_and_scholarship","277742942_The_Global_Research_Village_A_view_from_the_Periphery","275163576_How_might_open_access_become_sustainable","272235690_Effect_of_Institutional_Prestige_on_Reviewers'_Recommendations_and_Editorial_Decisions","264729176_Applied_Linguistics_Proper_Relocation_Reorientation_and_Realignment","264677414_Attitudes_of_Journal_Editors_to_Nonnative_Speaker_Contributions","264677338_English_for_Specific_Purposes_Teaching_to_Perceived_Needs_and_Imagined_Futures_in_Worlds_of_Work_Study_and_Everyday_Life","264226501_The_Challenge_of_Academic_Publishing_A_Hong_Kong_Perspective","254749327_'English_in_the_social_sciences'","248686582_Grant_D_McConnell_A_macro-sociolinguistic_analysis_of_language_vitality_Geolinguistic_profiles_and_scenarios_of_language_contact_in_India_Publication_of_the_International_Center_for_Research_on_Langua","248484252_Index_MedicusR_price_study_publishing_trends_from_1994-1998","248483711_Index_Medicus_Price_Study_Publishing_Trends_from_1988_to_1992","248065425_Economic_analysis_of_scientific_research_publishing","246506469_International_collaboration_in_science_The_case_of_India_and_China","243501038_The_Interpretation_of_Cultures_Selected_Essays","239667929_Disciplinary_Discourses_Social_Interactions_in_Academic_Writing","238212291_Cultural_differences_in_academic_rhetoric","237968347_Nondiscursive_Requirements_in_Academic_Publishing_Material_Resources_of_Periphery_Scholars_and_the_Politics_of_Knowledge_Production","236310535_US_and_Non-US_SubmissionsAn_Analysis_of_Reviewer_Bias","234451052_The_citation_process_The_role_and_significance_of_citations_in_scientific_communication","233678249_Global_English_and_local_language_policies_What_Denmark_needs","233245928_Academic_Language_Barriers_and_Language_Freedom","223624204_Developing_Chinese_scientists'_skills_for_publishing_in_English_Evaluating_collaborating-colleague_workshops_based_on_genre_analysis","223812908_A_doctoral_student_of_physics_writing_for_publication_A_sociopolitically-oriented_case_study","222664502_Transforming_Access_to_Research_Literature_for_Developing_Countries","222367485_The_role_of_English_in_scientific_communication_Lingua_franca_or_Tyrannosaurus_Rex","208574033_The_Interpretation_of_Culture"]}
