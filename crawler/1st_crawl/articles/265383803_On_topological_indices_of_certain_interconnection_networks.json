{"id":"265383803_On_topological_indices_of_certain_interconnection_networks","abstract":"In QSAR/QSPR study, physico-chemical properties and topological indices such as Randic´ ,\natom-bond connectivity (ABC) and geometric-arithmetic (GA) index are used to predict\nthe bioactivity of chemical compounds. A topological index is actually designed by transforming\na chemical structure into a numeric number. These topological indices correlate\ncertain physico-chemical properties like boiling point, stability, strain energy etc of chemical\ncompounds. Graph theory has found a considerable use in this area of research.\nThe topological properties of certain networks are studied recently in [13] by Hayat and\nImran (2014). In this paper, we extend this study to interconnection networks and derive\nanalytical closed results of general Randic´ index Ra(G) for different values of ‘‘a’’ for butterfly\nand Benes networks. We also compute first Zagreb, ABC, and GA indices for these important\nclasses of networks. Moreover, we construct two new classes of mesh derived\nnetworks by using some basic operations of graphs on m � n mesh networks, and then\nstudy certain topological indices for these classes of networks.","authors":["Muhammad Imran","Sakander Hayat","Muhammad Yasir Hayat Malik"],"meta":["August 2014Applied Mathematics and Computation 244(2014):936-951","DOI:10.1016/j.amc.2014.07.064"],"references":["281511584_Computation_of_Certain_Topological_Indices_of_Nanotubes_Covered_by_C_5_and_C_7SUB","279311847_On_Degree_Based_Topological_Indices_of_Certain_Nanotubes","267390975_Computation_of_Certain_Topological_Indices_of_Nanotubes","262490136_Computation_of_topological_indices_of_certain_networks","261257437_Self-organization_towards_optimally_interdependent_networks_by_means_of_coevolution","256071988_Spreading_of_cooperative_behaviour_across_interdependent_groups","253241066_On_molecular_graphs_with_smallest_and_greatest_zeroth-order_general_Randic_index","235399088_Interdependent_network_reciprocity_in_evolutionary_games","234098905_Evolutionary_dynamics_of_group_interactions_on_structured_populations_A_review","314000866_Multistage_Interconnection_Networks","298960918_Optical_interconnection_networks","281993886_An_atom-bond_connectivity_index_Modelling_the_enthalpy_of_formation_of_alkanes","281600468_Metric_dimension_of_certain_mesh_derived_graphs","281582662_Computing_Ga_index_for_some_nanotubes","268863546_Topological_Structure_and_Analysis_of_Interconnection_Networks","267057070_Mathematical_Aspects_of_Randic-Type_Molecular_Structure_Descriptors","265357376_Graphs_of_extremal_weights","246775503_Mathatical_Concepts_in_Organic_Chemistry","237082792_Collective_behavior_and_evolutionary_games_-_An_introduction_Chaos_Solit","232629029_Addressing_Routing_and_Broadcasting_in_Hexagonal_Mesh_Multiprocessors","231473566_On_Characterization_of_Molecular_Branching","226275480_Topological_index_based_on_the_ratios_of_geometrical_and_arithmetical_means_of_end-vertex_degrees_of_edges","220657985_An_efficient_representation_of_Benes_networks_and_its_applications","220587692_Multicasts_on_WDM_All-Optical_Butterfly_Networks","220526536_The_Selective_Extra_Stage_Butterfly","220522029_The_Vertex-Connectivity_Index_Revisited","51988364_Evolution_of_public_cooperation_on_interdependent_networks_The_impactof_biased_utility_functions","44378821_Mathematical_theory_of_connecting_networks_and_telephone_traffic_Vaclav_E_Benes","42309069_Structural_Determination_of_Paraffin_Boiling_Points","38018317_Coevolutionary_games-A_mini_review","2478295_Graphs_With_Maximum_Connectivity_Index"]}
