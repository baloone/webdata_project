{"id":"321017654_Non-commutative_arithmetic_circuits_with_division","abstract":"We initiate the study of the complexity of arithmetic circuits with division gates over non-commuting variables. Such circuits and formulae compute non-commutative rational functions, which, despite their name, can no longer be expressed as ratios of polynomials. We prove some lower and upper bounds, completeness and simulation results, as follows. If X is an n×n matrix consisting of n² distinct mutually non-commuting variables, we show that: (i). X⁻¹ can be computed by a circuit of polynomial size. (ii). Every formula computing some entry of X⁻¹ must have size at least 2Ω(n). We also show that matrix inverse is complete in the following sense: (i). Assume that a non-commutative rational function f can be computed by a formula of size s. Then there exists an invertible 2s×2s-matrix A whose entries are variables or field elements such that f is an entry of A⁻¹. (ii). If f is a non-commutative polynomial computed by a formula without inverse gates then A can be taken as an upper triangular matrix with field elements on the diagonal. We show how divisions can be eliminated from non-commutative circuits and formulae which compute polynomials, and we address the non-commutative version of the “rational function identity testing” problem. As it happens, the complexity of both of these procedures depends on a single open problem in invariant theory.","authors":["Pavel Hrubes","Avi Wigderson"],"meta":["December 2015Theory of Computing 11(1):357-393","DOI:10.4086/toc.2015.v011a014"],"references":["280873010_On_generating_the_ring_of_matrix_semi-invariants","280773582_Non-commutative_Edmonds'_problem_and_matrix_semi-invariants","254310377_A_GEOMETRIC_APPROACH_TO_THE_KRONECKER_PROBLEM_II_INVARIANTS_OF_MATRICES_FOR_SIMULTANEOUS_LEFT-RIGHT_ACTIONS","226827838_Semi-invariants_of_quivers_as_determinants","226488690_Deterministic_polynomial_identity_testing_in_non-commutative_models","226194761_Invariants_of_several_matrices","220365641_Arithmetic_Circuits_A_survey_of_recent_results_and_open_questions","346675793_Polynomial_bounds_for_rings_of_invariants","268442294_Polynomial_identities_in_ring_theory","266618022_Right_ideals_generated_by_an_idempotent_of_finite_rank","266038630_On_P_vs_NP_and_Geometric_Complexity_Theory","265564734_Determinants_of_matrices_over_noncommutative_rings","265505400_Rational_series_and_their_languages","265451190_Unzerlegbare_Darstellungen_I_Indecomposable_representations_I","265366755_Skew_fields_Theory_of_general_division_rings","265333427_Theory_of_noncommutative_determinants_and_characteristic_functions_of_graphs","263791386_On_the_construction_of_the_free_field","261849791_Non-commutative_arithmetic_circuits_with_division","261211965_Geometric_Complexity_Theory_V_Equivalence_between_Blackbox_Derandomization_of_Polynomial_Identity_Testing_and_Derandomization_of_Noether's_Normalization_Lemma","256105244_The_invariant_theory_of_n_n_matrices","248845048_Invariants_and_the_ring_of_generic_matrices","248202984_Undergraduate_Texts_in_Mathematics","243110163_Vermeidung_von_Divisionen","243088358_A_Prime_Matrix_Ideal_Yields_a_Skew_Field","243050605_Minimal_Identities_for_Algebras","243016252_Rational_identities_and_applications_to_algebra_and_geometry","241623009_The_GCT_program_toward_the_P_vs_NP_problem","240730589_COMMUTATIVENONCOMMUTATIVE_RANK_OF_LINEAR_MATRICES_AND_SUBSPACES_OF_MATRICES_OF_LOW_RANK","240233859_Semi-invariants_of_quivers_and_saturation_for_Littlewood-Richardson_coefficients","234828972_Lower_bounds_for_non-commutative_computation","231127316_Trace_identities_of_full_matrix_algebras_over_a_field_of_characteristic_zero","228566887_Arithmetic_Complexity_in_Ring_Extensions","227202609_Inversion_Height_in_Free_Fields","227150482_Gaussian_elimination_is_not_optimal","225198578_Ueber_die_vollen_Invariantensysteme","224151250_Relationless_Completeness_and_Separations","222554384_Singularities_of_rational_functions_and_minimal_factorizations_The_noncommutative_and_the_commutative_setting","221591597_Completeness_Classes_in_Algebra","220430681_The_Parallel_Evaluation_of_General_Arithmetic_Expressions","44329388_Free_rings_and_their_relations_by_P_M_Cohn","4150617_More_on_noncommutative_polynomial_identity_testing","2886474_Deterministic_Polynomial_Identity_Testing_in_Non_Commutative","2239420_Computational_Invariant_Theory"]}
