{"id":"258251604_Big_data_in_biomedicine","abstract":"The increasing availability and growth rate of biomedical information, also known as 'big data', provides an opportunity for future personalized medicine programs that will significantly improve patient care. Recent advances in information technology (IT) applied to biomedicine are changing the landscape of privacy and personal information, with patients getting more control of their health information. Conceivably, big data analytics is already impacting health decisions and patient care; however, specific challenges need to be addressed to integrate current discoveries into medical practice. In this article, I discuss the major breakthroughs achieved in combining omics and clinical health data in terms of their application to personalized medicine. I also review the challenges associated with using big data in biomedicine and translational science.","authors":["Fabricio F Costa"],"meta":["October 2013Drug Discovery Today 19(4)","DOI:10.1016/j.drudis.2013.10.012","SourcePubMed"],"references":["260019462_An_integrated_map_of_genetic_variation_from_1092_human_genomes_Consortium_GP_Nature_2012_491_56_65_101038nature11632","256102373_Automatic_Prediction_of_Rheumatoid_Arthritis_Disease_Activity_from_the_Electronic_Medical_Records","242015068_Automatic_Diagnosis_of_Pathological_Myopia_from_Heterogeneous_Biomedical_Data","237016228_Targeted_therapy_for_HER2_positive_breast_cancer","236941212_Streaming_Support_for_Data_Intensive_Cloud-Based_Sequence_Analysis","236193698_Comprehensive_Characterization_of_Human_Genome_Variation_by_High_Coverage_Whole-Genome_Sequencing_of_Forty_Four_Caucasians","235778448_Influenza_Forecasting_with_Google_Flu_Trends","235714065_The_association_between_Parkinson's_disease_and_anti-epilepsy_drug_carbamazepine_A_case-control_study_using_the_UK_General_Practice_Research_Database","235682808_Caught_in_the_Web_Informed_Consent_for_Online_Health_Research","230832927_The_changing_privacy_landscape_in_the_era_of_big_data","230813043_The_ENCODE_Project_Consortium_An_integrated_encyclopedia_of_DNA_elements_in_the_human_genome_2012_Nature_489_57-74","230810980_Landscape_of_transcription_in_human_cells","230810979_Architecture_of_the_human_regulatory_network_derived_from_ENCODE_data","230810978_An_expansive_human_regulatory_lexicon_encoded_in_transcription_factor_footprints","230810976_An_integrated_encyclopedia_of_DNA_elements_in_the_human_genome","227709602_The_coming_age_of_data-driven_medicine_Translational_bioinformatics'_next_frontier","224867157_The_1000_Genomes_Project_Data_Management_and_Community_Access","221818054_A_comparison_of_cataloged_variation_between_International_HapMap_Consortium_and_1000_Genomes_Project_data","221775084_Distributed_Human_Intelligence_for_Colonic_Polyp_Classification_in_Computer-aided_Detection_for_CT_Colonography","221733874_Google_Flu_Trends_Correlation_With_Emergency_Department_Influenza_Rates_and_Crowding_Metrics","221690555_Sampling_Populations_of_Humans_across_the_World_ELSI_Issues","51844485_MetaBinG_Using_GPUs_to_Accelerate_Metagenomic_Sequence_Classification","51764596_A_CFTR_Potentiator_in_Patients_with_Cystic_Fibrosis_and_the_G551D_Mutation","51508611_An_Integrated_Semiconductor_Device_Enabling_Non-Optical_Genome_Sequencing","43343281_BioTorrents_A_File_Sharing_Service_for_Scientific_Data","41040889_Multifactor_Dimensionality_Reduction_for_Graphics_Processing_Units_Enables_Genome-wide_Testing_of_Epistasis_in_Sporadic_ALS","24261022_Continuous_Base_Identification_for_Single-Molecule_Nanopore_DNA_Sequencing","289771060_Basic_Research_Applied_Medicine_and_EHRs_-_Are_we_on_the_Right_Track","284143841_Big_data_in_genomics_Challenges_and_solutions","284063125_Genomics_epigenomics_and_personalized_medicine_A_bright_future_for_drug_development","237839494_Biology_The_big_challenges_of_big_data","236186128_Clinical_Analysis_and_Interpretation_of_Cancer_Genome_Data","232719787_Social_networks_web-based_tools_and_diseases_Implications_for_biomedical_research","232236362_Genome_interpreter_vies_for_place_in_clinical_market","231224962_Why_imatinib_remains_an_exception_of_cancer_research","230841693_Genomics_ENCODE_leads_the_way_on_big_data","230827403_ENCODE_the_human_encyclopaedia","230811125_Genomics_ENCODE_project_writes_eulogy_for_junk_DNA","230810974_The_making_of_ENCODE_Lessons_for_big-data_projects","225095334_Melanoma_From_mutations_to_medicine","224878359_Mining_electronic_health_records_Towards_better_research_applications_and_clinical_care","224810008_Ten_ironic_rules_for_non-statistical_reviewers","224231904_Globus_Online_Accelerating_and_Democratizing_Science_through_Cloud-Based_Services","220425390_Software_as_a_Service_for_Data_Scientists","50270816_GBOOST_A_GPU-based_tool_for_detecting_gene-gene_interactions_in_genome-wide_case_control_studies","45278169_Natural_Language_Processing_Methods_and_Systems_for_Biomedical_Ontology_Learning","44669995_Non-coding_RNAs_Meet_thy_masters","38026398_Google_Trends_A_Web-Based_Tool_for_Real-Time_Surveillance_of_Disease_Outbreaks","24432704_Highly_accelerated_feature_detection_in_proteomics_data_sets_using_modern_graphics_processing_units","24415167_Non-coding_RNAs_and_new_opportunities_for_the_private_sector","6950175_Machine_Learning_for_Detection_and_Diagnosis_of_Disease","23669249_1000_Genomes_Project_Promises_Closer_Look_at_Variation_in_Human_Genome","23140014_The_discovery_of_structural_form","7648571_Non-coding_RNAs_New_players_in_eukaryotic_biology","6685080_Non-coding_RNAs_Lost_in_translation"]}
