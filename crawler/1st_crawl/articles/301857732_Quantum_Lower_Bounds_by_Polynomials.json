{"id":"301857732_Quantum_Lower_Bounds_by_Polynomials","abstract":"We examine the number T of queries that a quantum network requires to compute several Boolean functions on {0,1}^N in the black-box model. We show that, in the black-box model, the exponential quantum speed-up obtained for partial functions (i.e. problems involving a promise on the input) by Deutsch and Jozsa and by Simon cannot be obtained for any total function: if a quantum algorithm computes some total Boolean function f with bounded-error using T black-box queries then there is a classical deterministic algorithm that computes f exactly with O(T^6) queries. We also give asymptotically tight characterizations of T for all symmetric f in the exact, zero-error, and bounded-error settings. Finally, we give new precise bounds for AND, OR, and PARITY. Our results are a quantum extension of the so-called polynomial method, which has been successfully applied in classical complexity theory, and also a quantum extension of results by Nisan about a polynomial relationship between randomized and deterministic decision tree complexity.","authors":["Robert Beals","Harry Buhrman","Richard Cleve","Michele Mosca"],"meta":["February 1998"],"references":["4355127_Probabilistic_Boolean_decision_trees_and_the_complexity_of_evaluating_game_trees","3758335_Complexity_Limitations_on_Quantum_Computation","3557362_On_oracle_builder's_toolkit","2578611_Quantum_vs_Classical_Communication_and_Computation","2576241_Quantum_Oracle_Interrogation_Getting_All_Information_for_Almost_Half_the_Price","2508255_On_the_Degree_of_Boolean_Functions_as_Real_Polynomials","2203843_The_Hidden_Subgroup_Problem_and_Eigenvalue_Estimation_on_a_Quantum_Computer","2202982_Quantum_Counting","2202583_Quantum_Computer_Can_Not_Speed_Up_Iterated_Applications_of_a_Black_Box","2202296_Quantum_algorithms_revisited","2202106_Quantum_Algorithm_for_the_Collision_Problem","319523609_Tight_Bounds_on_Quantum_Searching","273559873_CREW_PRAMs_and_decision_trees","241480536_A_Comparison_of_Uniform_Approximations_on_an_Interval_and_a_Finite_Subset_Thereof","238358717_Tight_bounds_on_quantum_search","235588570_Conjugated_operators_in_quantum_algorithms","235575232_Grover's_quantum_searching_algorithm_is_optimal","228109531_Rapid_Solution_of_Problems_by_Quantum_Computation","226655350_Schwankung_von_Polynomen_zwischen_Gitterpunkten","221591218_On_the_Degree_of_Polynomials_that_Approximate_Symmetric_Boolean_Functions_Preliminary_Version","221590938_CREW_PRAMs_and_decision_trees","221355439_Quantum_Cryptanalysis_of_Hidden_Linear_Functions_Extended_Abstract","220617297_Strengths_and_Weakness_of_Quantum_Computing","220442010_Polynomials_with_two_Values","220138846_Quantum_measurements_and_the_Abelian_Stabilizer_Problem","3693208_An_exact_quantum_polynomial-time_algorithm_for_Simon's_problem","3593091_On_the_power_of_quantum_computation","3557351_The_polynomial_method_in_circuit_complexity","3509266_On_the_Monte_Carlo_Boolean_decision_tree_complexity_of_read-once_formulae","2818380_Polynomial-Time_Algorithms_For_Prime_Factorization_And_Discrete_Logarithms_On_A_Quantum_Computer","2291639_Quantum_Searching_Counting_and_Amplitude_Amplification_by_Eigenvector_Analysis","2202711_A_Limit_on_the_Speed_of_Quantum_Computation_in_Determining_Parity","2201607_Fast_quantum_mechanical_algorithm_for_database_search"]}
