The key part of the method is the `empirical mode decomposition' method with which any complicated data set can be decomposed into a finite and often small number of 'intrinsic mode functions' that admit well-behaved Hilbert transforms. This decomposition method is adaptive, and, therefore, highly efficient. Since the decomposition is based on the local characteristic time scale of the data, it is applicable to nonlinear and non-stationary processes. With the Hilbert transform, the 'instrinic mode functions' yield instantaneous frequencies as functions of time that give sharp identifications of imbedded structures. The final presentation of the results is an energy-frequency-time distribution, designated as the Hilbert spectrum. In this method, the main conceptual innovations are the introduction of `intrinsic mode functions' based on local properties of the signal, which make the instantaneous frequency meaningful; and th","authors":["Norden Huang","Zheng Shen","Steven R.
