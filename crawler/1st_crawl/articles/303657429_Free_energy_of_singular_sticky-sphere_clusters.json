{"id":"303657429_Free_energy_of_singular_sticky-sphere_clusters","abstract":"Networks of particles connected by springs model many condensed-matter systems, from colloids interacting with a short-range potential, to complex fluids near jamming, to self-assembled lattices, to origami-inspired materials. Under small thermal fluctuations the vibrational entropy of a ground state is given by the harmonic approximation if it has no zero-frequency modes, yet such \"singular\" states are at the epicenter of many interesting behaviors in the systems above. To account for singularities we consider a finite cluster of $N$ spherical particles and solve for the partition function in the sticky limit where the pairwise interaction is strong and short ranged. Although the partition function diverges for singular clusters in the limit, the asymptotic contribution can be calculated and depends on only two parameters, characterizing the depth and range of the potential. The result holds for clusters that are second-order rigid, a geometric characterization that describes all known ground-state (rigid) sticky clusters. To illustrate our theory we address the question of emergence: how does order arise in large systems when it is strongly disfavored in small ones? We calculate the partition functions of all known rigid clusters up to $N\\leq 19$, and show the cluster landscape is dominated by hyperstatic clusters (those with more than $3N-6$ contacts) -- singular and isostatic clusters are far less frequent, despite their extra vibrational and configurational entropies. Since the most hyperstatic clusters are close to fragments of a close-packed lattice, this underlies the emergence of order in sticky-sphere systems, even those as small as $N=10$.","authors":["Yoav Kallus","Miranda Holmes-Cerfon"],"meta":["May 2016PHYSICAL REVIEW E 95(2)","DOI:10.1103/PhysRevE.95.022130"],"references":["280221407_Celebrating_Soft_Matter's_10th_Anniversary_Testing_the_Foundations_of_Classical_Entropy_Colloid_Experiments","263773864_Mechanical_instability_at_finite_temperature","261475561_Nonlinear_conduction_via_solitons_in_a_topological_mechanical_insulator","253976227_Calculation_of_thermodynamic_properties_of_small_Lennard-Jones_clusters_incorporating_anharmonicity","238977663_Magic_Numbers_for_Sphere_Packings_Experimental_Verification_in_Free_Xenon_Clusters","235337879_Developments_in_understanding_and_controlling_self_assembly_of_DNA-functionalized_colloids","225054584_Decoding_the_energy_landscape_Extracting_structure_dynamics_and_thermodynamics","220452662_Higher-Order_Rigidity_-_What_Is_the_Proper_Definition","51716329_Nanoparticle_Superlattice_Engineering_with_DNA","51624033_Direct_measurements_of_DNA-mediated_colloidal_interactions_and_their_quantitative_modeling","51454433_Geometric_frustration_in_small_colloidal_clusters","47821717_Deriving_Finite_Sphere_Packings","27260782_Modeling_the_structure_of_clusters_of_C60_molecules","303748727_The_rigidity_of_graphs","301874215_Breakdown_of_Elasticity_in_Amorphous_Solids","298330978_Dynamical_properties_of_two-_and_three-dimensional_colloidal_clusters_of_six_particles","292670883_Segregation_of_Isotope_Particles_within_Colloidal_Molecules","292343109_Nonlinear_plastic_modes_in_disordered_solids","291954812_Clusters_of_polyhedra_in_spherical_confinement","286461670_Rigid-unit_phonon_modes_and_structural_phase_transitions_in_framework_silicates","281338001_COLLOIDS_Colloidal_matter_Packing_geometry_and_entropy","275062996_The_Exponentially_Convergent_Trapezoidal_Rule","272194384_Selective_buckling_via_states_of_self-stress_in_topological_metamaterials","268689756_Two-Dimensional_Clusters_of_Colloidal_Spheres_Ground_States_Excited_States_and_Structural_Rearrangements","267742595_Size_limits_of_self-assembled_colloidal_structures_made_using_specific_interactions","266987678_Geometric_folding_algorithms_Linkages_origami_polyhedra_Paperback_reprint_of_the_2007_original","263967945_Structure_and_dynamics_of_model_colloidal_clusters_with_short-range_attractions","263930119_Enumerating_Rigid_Sphere_Packings","260642534_Phonon_contribution_to_the_entropy_of_hard_sphere_crystals","259848052_Self-replicating_colloidal_clusters","249050169_Comparison_between_icosahedral_decahedral_and_crystalline_Lennard-Jones_models_containing_500_to_6000_atoms","243681429_Supercooling_of_Liquids","243015281_The_rigidity_of_certain_cabled_frameworks_and_the_second-order_rigidity_of_arbitrarily_triangulated_convex_surfaces","238977675_Icosahedral_Bond_Orientational_Order_in_Supercooled_Liquids","235244654_The_Structure_and_Stability_of_Atomic_Liquids_From_Clusters_to_Bulk","234145806_Colloidal_Particles_Crystals_Glasses_and_Gels","234123267_Entropy_favours_open_colloidal_lattices","234102461_Percus-yevick_Equation_For_Hard_Spheres_With_Surface_Adhesion","233941950_A_geometrical_approach_to_computing_free-energy_landscapes_from_short-ranged_potentials","232751969_Geometry_of_the_Structure_of_Monatomic_Liquids","232750498_Does_C60_have_a_liquid_phase","227022892_Sticky_spheres_and_related_systems","222459095_Buckminster_Fuller's_Tensegrity_structures_and_Clerk_Maxwell's_rules_for_the_construction_of_stiff_frames","221666164_Structure_of_finite_sphere_packings_via_exact_enumeration_Implications_for_colloidal_crystal_nucleation","51699042_Energy_landscapes_of_colloidal_clusters_Thermodynamics_and_rearrangement_mechanisms","51485582_Liquid_Proteins-A_New_Frontier_for_Biomolecule-Based_Nanoscience","50397750_Densest_local_packing_diversity_II_Application_to_three_dimensions","50304278_Design_principles_for_self-assembly_with_short-range_interactions","44670040_Energy_Landscapes_of_Clusters_Bound_by_Short-Ranged_Potentials","41173802_The_Free-Energy_Landscape_of_Clusters_of_Attractive_Hard_Spheres","24173824_Simple_Quantitative_Model_for_the_Reversible_Association_of_DNA_Coated_Colloids","24164605_ITEPTH-1209_Introduction_to_Integral_Discriminants","23710632_Elasticity_of_Floppy_and_Stiff_Random_Networks","11789798_A_Microscopic_Basis_for_the_Global_Appearance_of_Energy_Landscapes","10643320_Dense_Packing_and_Symmetry_in_Small_Clusters_of_Microspheres"]}
