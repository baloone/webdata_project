The GA-BP ANN has been trained offline for classification of input queries and user query session profiles to a specific cluster based on clustered web query sessions. Thus during online web search, trained GA -BP ANN is used for classification of new user queries to a cluster and the selected cluster is used for web page recommendations. This process of classification and recommendations continues till search is effectively personalized to the information need of the user. Experiment was conducted on the data set of web user query sessions to evaluate the effectiveness of Personalized Web Search using GA optimized BP ANN and the results confirm the improvement in the precision of search results.","authors":["Suruchi Chawla"],"meta":["January 2016International Journal of Applied Evolutionary Computation 7(1):33-49","DOI:10.4018/IJAEC.2016010103"],"references":["221136102_A_System_for_Adaptive_Information_Retrieval","38416605_Comparison_of_SVM_and_Some_Older_Classification_Algorithms_in_Text_Classification_Tasks","3420381_Feature_Subset_Selection_Using_a_Genetic_Algorithm","301951311_Query_Expansion_Based_on_a_Personalized_Web_Search_Model","226107618_Personalized_Web_Search_Using_Information_Scent","221635580_Building_Concept_Network-Based_User_Profile_for_Personalized_Web_Search","221397552_Query_Expansion_Using_External_Evidence","4314819_Query_Expansion_Based_on_a_Personalized_Web_Search_Model"]}
