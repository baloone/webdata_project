{"id":"240764746_Sex_and_Cultural_Differences_in_Map_Reading","abstract":"The study examined sex and cultural differences in map reading. Test materials included 45 multiple-choice questions, with 15 questions each on reference maps, topographic maps, and a street map. Subjects included 202 college students in introductory psychology classes from North Dakota and Taiwan with equal proportions of males and females. Results show that males performed significantly better than females in reference and topographic map reading; Taiwan subjects outperformed North Dakota subjects in topographic map reading; the sex difference existed in both cultural groups; and performance scores on the three map types from individual subjects were significantly correlated.","authors":["Kang-tsung Chang","James R.
