{"id":"277722488_Faster_R-CNN_Towards_Real-Time_Object_Detection_with_Region_Proposal_Networks","abstract":"State-of-the-art object detection networks depend on region proposal\nalgorithms to hypothesize object locations. Advances like SPPnet and Fast R-CNN\nhave reduced the running time of these detection networks, exposing region\nproposal computation as a bottleneck. In this work, we introduce a Region\nProposal Network (RPN) that shares full-image convolutional features with the\ndetection network, thus enabling nearly cost-free region proposals. An RPN is a\nfully-convolutional network that simultaneously predicts object bounds and\nobjectness scores at each position. RPNs are trained end-to-end to generate\nhigh-quality region proposals, which are used by Fast R-CNN for detection. With\na simple alternating optimization, RPN and Fast R-CNN can be trained to share\nconvolutional features. For the very deep VGG-16 model, our detection system\nhas a frame rate of 5fps (including all steps) on a GPU, while achieving\nstate-of-the-art object detection accuracy on PASCAL VOC 2007 (73.2% mAP) and\n2012 (70.4% mAP) using 300 proposals per image. The code will be released.","authors":["Shaoqing Ren","Kaiming He","Ross Girshick","Jian Sun"],"meta":["June 2015IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence 39(6)","DOI:10.1109/TPAMI.2016.2577031","SourcearXiv"],"references":["289917319_Deep_Neural_Networks_for_object_detection","272521784_What_Makes_for_Effective_Detection_Proposals","269116491_Scalable_High-Quality_Object_Detection","265295439_ImageNet_Large_Scale_Visual_Recognition_Challenge","264979485_Caffe_Convolutional_Architecture_for_Fast_Feature_Embedding","263471546_How_good_are_detection_proposals_really","262270555_Selective_Search_for_Object_Recognition","259441043_OverFeat_Integrated_Recognition_Localization_and_Detection_using_Convolutional_Networks","259212328_Scalable_Object_Detection_Using_Deep_Neural_Networks","238347229_The_Pascal_Visual_Object_Classes_Challenge_2006_VOC2006_Results","319770430_Rich_feature_hierarchies_for_accurate_object_detection_and_semantic_segmentation","319770284_Edge_Boxes_Locating_Object_Proposals_from_Edges","319770168_Fully_Convolutional_Networks_for_Semantic_Segmentation","308859280_Convolutional_feature_masking_for_joint_object_and_stuff_segmentation","301921832_Fully_convolutional_networks_for_semantic_segmentation","277022688_Object-Proposal_Evaluation_Protocol_is_'Gameable'","275364732_Object_Detection_Networks_on_Convolutional_Feature_Maps","269116736_Convolutional_Feature_Masking_for_Joint_Object_and_Stuff_Segmentation","267960550_ImageNet_Classification_with_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","265385906_Very_Deep_Convolutional_Networks_for_Large-Scale_Image_Recognition","263237865_Spatial_Pyramid_Pooling_in_Deep_Convolutional_Networks_for_Visual_Recognition","258424423_Visualizing_and_Understanding_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","258374356_Rich_Feature_Hierarchies_for_Accurate_Object_Detection_and_Semantic_Segmentation","221345737_Rectified_Linear_Units_Improve_Restricted_Boltzmann_Machines_Vinod_Nair","216792879_Backpropagation_Applied_to_Handwritten_Zip_Code_Recognition"]}
