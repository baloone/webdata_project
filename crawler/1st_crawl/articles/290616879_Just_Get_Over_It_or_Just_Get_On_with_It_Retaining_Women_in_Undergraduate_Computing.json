{"id":"290616879_Just_Get_Over_It_or_Just_Get_On_with_It_Retaining_Women_in_Undergraduate_Computing","abstract":"This chapter presents the findings of the first nationwide study of factors that lead to gendered outcomes in undergraduate computer science departments. Multiple methods, measures, and cases were used to describe conditions in the average undergraduate computer science program and quantify the extent to which these factors influence whether women are retained at rates comparable to their male classmates. The results show that faculty members as well as same-sex peers play a key role in the retention of women in postsecondary computing. The outcomes for women approach those of men in departments where faculty members encourage students, mentor undergraduates, and emphasize homework and focus as the route to academic success in computing.","authors":["J.
