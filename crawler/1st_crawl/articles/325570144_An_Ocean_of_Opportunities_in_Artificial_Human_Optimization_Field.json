{"id":"325570144_An_Ocean_of_Opportunities_in_Artificial_Human_Optimization_Field","abstract":"Global Optimization Techniques like Genetic Algorithms, Particle Swarm Optimization, Ant Colony Optimization and other optimization techniques were used in literature to solve complex optimization problems. Many optimization algorithms were proposed in literature by taking the behavior of Birds, Ants, Fishes, Chromosomes etc. as inspiration. Recently, a new trend has begun in Evolutionary Computing Domain where optimization algorithms have been created by taking Human Behavior as inspiration. The focus of this paper is on optimization algorithms that were and are being created based on the behavior of Artificial Humans. In December 2016, a new field titled “Artificial Human Optimization” was proposed in literature. This paper is strongly meant to popularize “Artificial Human Optimization” field like never before by showing an Ocean of Opportunities that exists in this new and interesting area of research. A new field titled “Artificial Economics Optimization” is proposed at the end of paper.","authors":["Satish Gajawada"],"meta":["May 2018","DOI:10.14738/tmlai.63.4529","Project: Artificial Human Optimization"],"references":["325570137_Artificial_Human_Optimization_-_An_Introduction","325569937_Entrepreneur_Artificial_Human_Optimization","325569918_CEO_Different_Reviews_on_PhD_in_Artificial_Intelligence","266594969_Vinayaka_A_Semi-Supervised_Projected_Clustering_Method_Using_Differential_Evolution","261704446_Human_Behavior-Based_Particle_Swarm_Optimization","257744020_Projected_Clustering_Using_Particle_Swarm_Optimization","289625406_SPPS_Supervised_Projected_Clustering_Method_Based_on_Particle_Swarm_Optimization","261044121_A_framework_for_classification_using_genetic_algorithm_based_clustering"]}
