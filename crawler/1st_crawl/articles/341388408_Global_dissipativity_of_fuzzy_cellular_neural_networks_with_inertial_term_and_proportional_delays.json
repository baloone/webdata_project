{"id":"341388408_Global_dissipativity_of_fuzzy_cellular_neural_networks_with_inertial_term_and_proportional_delays","abstract":"This paper is concerned with the global dissipativity of fuzzy cellular neural networks with inertial term and proportional delays. Based on Lyapunov functionals and linear matrix inequality approach, new sufficient conditions are derived to ensure the global dissipativity and global exponential dissipativity of the suggested system. Moreover, the globally exponential attractive sets and positive invariant sets are also presented here. Finally, two numerical examples with its simulations are proposed to illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained results.","authors":["Chaouki Aouiti","Sakthivel Rathinasamy","Farid Touati"],"meta":["May 2020International Journal of Systems Science 51(9):1-14","DOI:10.1080/00207721.2020.1764128"],"references":["336983470_Global_dissipativity_of_high-order_Hopfield_bidirectional_associative_memory_neural_networks_with_mixed_delays","328812163_Stability_Analysis_for_a_Class_of_Impulsive_Bidirectional_Associative_Memory_BAM_Neural_Networks_with_Distributed_Delays_and_Leakage_Time-Varying_Delays","326064110_Anti-Periodic_Dynamics_of_Quaternion-Valued_Fuzzy_Cellular_Neural_Networks_with_Time-Varying_Delays_on_Time_Scales","325453281_Convergence_of_Neutral_Type_Fuzzy_Cellular_Neural_Networks_with_D_Operator","323672016_Piecewise_asymptotically_almost_automorphic_solutions_for_impulsive_non-autonomous_high-order_Hopfield_neural_networks_with_mixed_delays","322643359_Global_Dissipativity_of_Inertial_Neural_Networks_with_Proportional_Delay_via_New_Generalized_Halanay_Inequalities","316873499_Finite_time_boundedness_of_neutral_high-order_Hopfield_neural_networks_with_time_delay_in_the_leakage_term_and_mixed_time_delays","316489507_Dissipativity_analysis_of_complex-valued_BAM_neural_networks_with_time_delay","316362565_New_results_on_convergence_of_fuzzy_cellular_neural_networks_with_multi-proportional_delays","306324493_Piecewise_Pseudo_Almost_Periodic_Solution_for_Impulsive_Generalised_High-Order_Hopfield_Neural_Networks_with_Leakage_Delays","294283439_Almost_periodic_solutions_for_fuzzy_cellular_neural_networks_with_multi-proportional_delays","51497540_Dissipativity_and_quasi-synchronization_for_neural_networks_with_discontinuous_activations_and_parameter_mismatches","23758678_Global_dissipativity_analysis_on_uncertain_neural_networks_with_mixed_time-varying_delays","326966169_mu_nu_mn-Pseudo-almost_automorphic_solutions_for_high-order_Hopfield_bidirectional_associative_memory_neural_networks","326588400_Global_exponential_convergence_of_neutral-type_competitive_neural_networks_with_multi-proportional_delays_distributed_delays_and_time-varying_delay_in_leakage_delays","322912746_Dynamics_and_oscillations_of_generalized_high-order_Hopfield_Neural_Networks_with_mixed_delays","322204109_Existence_and_global_exponential_stability_of_pseudo_almost_periodic_solution_for_neutral_delay_BAM_neural_networks_with_time-varying_delay_in_leakage_terms","320957151_New_results_on_global_exponential_dissipativity_analysis_of_memristive_inertial_neural_networks_with_distributed_time-varying_delays","318300587_Global_asymptotic_and_robust_stability_of_inertial_neural_networks_with_proportional_delays","316079016_Finite-time_synchronization_for_a_class_of_fuzzy_cellular_neural_networks_with_time-varying_coefficients_and_proportional_delays","315637183_Global_convergence_analysis_of_impulsive_inertial_neural_networks_with_time-varying_delays","313355345_Global_dissipativity_of_memristor-based_neutral_type_inertial_neural_networks","308799204_On_Global_Dissipativity_of_Nonautonomous_Neural_Networks_With_Multiple_Proportional_Delays","270968929_Global_dissipativity_of_a_class_of_BAM_neural_networks_with_both_time-varying_and_continuously_distributed_delays","262842740_Global_asymptotic_stability_of_cellular_neural_networks_with_proportional_delays","259992700_Asymptotic_stability_of_cellular_neural_networks_with_multiple_proportional_delays","257633902_Dissipativity_of_a_class_of_cellular_neural_networks_with_proportional_delays","257631838_Delay-Dependent_Exponential_Stability_of_Cellular_Neural_Networks_with_Multi-Proportional_Delays","257448836_Global_dissipativity_of_a_class_of_BAM_neural_networks_with_time-varying_and_unbound_delays","223219964_Exponential_stability_and_periodic_solutions_of_fuzzy_cellular_neural_networks_with_time-varying_delays","223149642_Global_dissipativity_of_neural_networks_with_both_variable_and_unbounded_delays","222022847_Dynamical_behaviors_of_discrete-time_fuzzy_cellular_neural_networks_with_variable_delays_and_impulses","220551547_Global_exponential_synchronization_of_fuzzy_cellular_neural_networks_with_delays_and_reaction-diffusion_terms","10600724_Global_dissipativity_of_continuous-time_recurrent_neural_networks_with_time_delay","3679176_Fuzzy_cellular_neural_networks_Theory"]}
