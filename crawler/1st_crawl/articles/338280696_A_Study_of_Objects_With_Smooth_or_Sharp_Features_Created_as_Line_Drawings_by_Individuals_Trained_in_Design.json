{"id":"338280696_A_Study_of_Objects_With_Smooth_or_Sharp_Features_Created_as_Line_Drawings_by_Individuals_Trained_in_Design","abstract":"There is a long history of studies of shape preference using simple abstract two-dimensional shapes. The evidence has confirmed a preference for symmetry, high contrast, and smoothness over asymmetry, low contrast, and angularity. However, the evidence about the role of culture and expertise is inconclusive. We asked a group of 56 expert designers (studying at the IUAV) to draw seven objects on paper and for each provide two versions: a smooth version and an angular version. These stimuli therefore show everyday objects, freely chosen by the authors, drawn with novel shapes. Next, we presented these stimuli to nonexperts. We collected ratings for seven characteristics (“ugly/beautiful, dark/light, complex/simple, heavy/light, old/modern, dangerous/safe, and asymmetrical/symmetrical”) from naive observers (n = 174). The analysis of the rating data confirmed a link between smoothness and beauty as well as a few other associations. We made the database (772 images) including the average ratings openly available to other researchers.","authors":["Marco Bertamini","Michele Sinico"],"meta":["December 2019Empirical Studies of the Arts 39(1):027623741989704","DOI:10.1177/0276237419897048"],"references":["327936181_Edge-Orientation_Entropy_Predicts_Preference_for_Diverse_Types_of_Man-Made_Images","325671732_Gender_differences_in_personality_traits_across_cultures_Robust_and_surprising_findings","325364470_Blindness_to_Curvature_and_Blindness_to_Illusory_Curvature","321282232_Curvature_Blindness_Illusion","319624162_Preference_for_Curvilinear_Contour_in_Interior_Architectural_Spaces_Evidence_From_Experts_and_Nonexperts","315934597_Curve_Appeal_Exploring_Individual_Differences_in_Preference_for_Curved_Versus_Angular_Objects","305035677_The_shapes_associated_with_approachavoidance_words","290510274_The_Curvature_Effect_A_Comparison_Between_Preference_Tasks","290477853_Preference_for_Curvature_A_Historical_and_Conceptual_Framework","283748667_Local_Solid_Shape","283747373_Common_Visual_Preference_for_Curved_Contours_in_Humans_and_Great_Apes","283073424_Comparing_Angular_and_Curved_Shapes_in_Terms_of_Implicit_Associations_and_ApproachAvoidance_Responses","274903267_Do_observers_like_curvature_or_do_they_dislike_angularity","270683523_'Selfies'_Reveal_Systematic_Deviations_from_Known_Principles_of_Photographic_Composition","269466729_Examining_visual_complexity_and_its_influence_on_perceived_duration","268372375_The_Golden_Section_and_the_Aesthetics_of_Form_and_Composition_A_Cognitive_Model","263352347_Fitting_Linear_Mixed-Effects_Models_Using_lme4","258350651_Statistical_image_properties_of_print_advertisements_visual_artworks_and_images_of_architecture","255706760_The_visual_system_prioritizes_locations_near_corners_of_surfaces_not_just_locations_near_a_corner","250146139_Do_People_Prefer_Curved_Objects_Angularity_Expertise_and_Aesthetic_Preference","242271871_An_oblique_effect_in_aesthetics_Homage_to_Mondrian_1872_1944_Perception_2000_volume_29_pages_981987","240762340_Sketches_for_Design_and_Design_of_Sketches","236164675_The_Kiki-Bouba_Effect_A_Case_of_Personification_and_Ideaesthesia","235615209_On_a_common_circle_Natural_scenes_and_Gestalt_rules","233789449_Processing_convexity_and_concavity_along_a_2-D_contour_Figure-ground_structural_shape_and_attention","233740682_Detection_of_symmetry_and_perceptual_organization_How_a_lock-and-key_process_works","233603316_Art_and_the_Brain","337176253_Analysis_of_Beauty_Written_with_a_View_of_Fixing_the_Fluctuating_Ideas_of_Taste","334315235_An_advantage_for_smooth_compared_with_angular_contours_in_the_speed_of_processing_shape","325973286_Stronger_shared_taste_for_natural_aesthetic_domains_than_for_artifacts_of_human_culture","324576176_Cross-cultural_empirical_aesthetics","322475281_A_biphasic_effect_of_cross-modal_priming_on_visual_shape_recognition","319770820_Histograms_of_Oriented_Gradients_for_Human_Detection","319643189_Preference_for_Curved_Contours_Across_Cultures","314660878_High_Entropy_of_Edge_Orientations_Characterizes_Visual_Artworks_from_Diverse_Cultural_Backgrounds","275820964_Art_and_Visual_Perception_A_Psychology_of_the_Creative_Eye","269514226_The_Green_Imperative_Design_for_the_Real_World","268903420_Aesthetic_Measure","260155782_Predictive_packaging_design_Tasting_shapes_typefaces_names_and_sounds","258132621_Furniture_Forms_and_Their_Influence_on_Our_Emotional_Responses_Toward_Interior_Environments","250146152_A_Test_of_Consensus_in_Aesthetic_Evaluation_among_Professional_Critics_of_Modern_Music","240793295_Preferences_in_Symmetries_and_Symmetries_in_Drawings_Asymmetries_Between_Ages_and_Sexes","235356458_Effects_of_Perceptual_Fluency_on_Affective_Judgments","232588099_The_Affective_Tone_of_Lines_Experimental_Researches","232583976_Obligatory_Edge_Assignment_in_Vision_The_Role_of_Figure_and_Part_Segmentation_in_Symmetry_Detection","232558348_The_empirical_determination_of_an_aesthetic_formula","232557560_How_We_Understand_Art_A_Cognitive_Developmental_Account_of_Aesthetic_Experience","232543102_Complexity-simplicity_I_Preference_for_symmetry_and_rejection_of_complexity","232532081_The_Feeling_Value_of_Lines","232513245_Drawing_and_Cognition_Descriptive_and_Experimental_Studies_of_Graphic_Production_Processes","232474141_The_brain_of_the_beholder","230587594_A_Century_of_Gestalt_Psychology_in_Visual_Perception_I_Perceptual_Grouping_and_Figure-Ground_Organization","232455499_Image_Quality_and_the_Aesthetic_Judgment_of_Photographs_Contrast_Sharpness_and_Grain_Teased_Apart_and_Put_Together","231513975_Detection_Theory_A_User's_Guide","230635492_The_GoNo-Go_association_task"]}
