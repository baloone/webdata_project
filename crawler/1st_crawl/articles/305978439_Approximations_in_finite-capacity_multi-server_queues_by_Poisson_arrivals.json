{"id":"305978439_Approximations_in_finite-capacity_multi-server_queues_by_Poisson_arrivals","abstract":"An approximation for the average delay in queue of an entering customer is presented for the M / G / K queuing model with finite capacity. The approximation is obtained by means of an approximation relating a joint distribution of remaining service time to the equilibrium service distribution.","authors":["Shirley A. Nozaki","Sheldon M.
