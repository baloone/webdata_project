{"id":"314030231_Limited_memory_Rank-1_Cuts_for_Vehicle_Routing_Problems","abstract":"Pecin et al. (2016) introduced a “limited memory” technique that allows an efficient use of Rank-1 cuts in the Set Partitioning Formulation of Vehicle Routing Problems, motivating a deeper investigation of those cuts. This work presents a computational polyhedral study that determines the best possible sets of multipliers for cuts with up to 5 rows. Experiments with CVRP instances show that the new multipliers lead to significantly improved dual bounds and contributes decisively for solving an open instance with 420 customers.","authors":["Diego Pecin","Artur Pessoa","Marcus Poggi","Eduardo Uchoa"],"meta":["February 2017Operations Research Letters 45(3)","DOI:10.1016/j.orl.2017.02.006"],"references":["273291502_A_Problem-Reduction_Evolutionary_Algorithm_for_Solving_the_Capacitated_Vehicle_Routing_Problem","242511324_Tabu_Search_Generalized_k-Path_Inequalities_and_Partial_Elementarity_for_the_Vehicle_Routing_Problem_with_Time_Windows","239061050_2Path_Cuts_for_the_Vehicle_Routing_Problem_with_Time_Windows","230846309_A_Hybrid_Genetic_Algorithm_for_Multidepot_and_Periodic_Vehicle_Routing_Problems","229087304_Clique_Inequalities_Applied_to_the_Vehicle_Routing_Problem_with_Time_Windows","226751366_On_the_Separation_of_Maximally_Violated_Mod-k_Cuts","226332218_Optimizing_over_the_first_Chvatal_closure","226084635_Chvatal-Gomory_Rank-1_Cuts_Used_in_a_Dantzig-Wolfe_Decomposition_of_the_Vehicle_Routing_Problem_with_Time_Windows","224103124_The_Common_Optimization_INterface_for_Operations_Research_Promoting_open-source_software_in_the_operations_research_community","221316860_On_the_Separation_of_Maximally_Violated_Mod-k_Cuts","221316774_Optimizing_over_the_First_Chvatal_Closure","220590043_Robust_Branch-and-Cut-and-Price_for_the_Capacitated_Vehicle_Routing_Problem","220243923_Subset-Row_Inequalities_Applied_to_the_Vehicle-Routing_Problem_with_Time_Windows","2905042_Integer_Program_Reformulation_for_Robust_Branch-and-Cut-and-Price_Algorithms","318828253_New_Enhancements_for_the_Exact_Solution_of_the_Vehicle_Routing_Problem_with_Time_Windows","303739411_Improved_branch-cut-and-price_for_capacitated_vehicle_routing","280757985_2-path_cuts_for_the_vehicle_routing_problem_with_time_windows","264994054_Improved_Branch-Cut-and-Price_for_Capacitated_Vehicle_Routing","261218509_A_new_exact_algorithm_for_the_multi-depot_vehicle_routing_problem_under_capacity_and_route_length_constraints","260637519_A_Survey_of_Resource_Constrained_Shortest_Path_Problems_Exact_Solution_Approaches","259928449_A_Hybrid_Genetic_Algorithm_for_Multidepot_and_Periodic_Vehicle_Routing_Problems","259125966_A_cooperative_parallel_metaheuristic_for_the_capacitated_vehicle_routing_problem","230820505_New_Route_Relaxation_and_Pricing_Strategies_for_the_Vehicle_Routing_Problem","221704641_On_An_Integer_Program_for_a_Delivery_Problem","220669241_A_Parallel_Algorithm_for_the_Vehicle_Routing_Problem","220471690_Lagrangian_duality_applied_to_the_vehicle_routing_problem_with_time_windows","216877601_Set_Partitioning_A_Survey"]}
