{"id":"308548925_Non-uniformity_correction_for_division_of_focal_plane_polarimeters_with_a_calibration_method","abstract":"Division of focal plane polarimeters are composed of nanometer polarization elements overlaid upon a focal plane array (FPA) sensor. The manufacturing flaws of the polarization grating and each detector in the FPA having a different photo response can introduce non-uniformity errors when reconstructing the polarization image without correction. A new calibration method is proposed to mitigate non-uniformity errors in the visible waveband. We correct non-uniformity in the form of a vector. The correction matrix and offset vector are calculated for the following correction. The performance of the proposed method is compared with state-of-the-art techniques by employing simulated data and real scenes. The experimental results showed that the proposed method can effectively mitigate non-uniformity errors and achieve better visual results.","authors":["Zhang Junchao","Haibo Luo","Hui Bin","Zhenxing Chang"],"meta":["September 2016Applied Optics 55(26):7236-7240","DOI:10.1364/AO.55.007236","Project: Polarization Imaging"],"references":["264503456_Image_dehazing_using_polarization_effects_of_objects_and_airlight","233975815_Liquid_crystal_polymer_full-stokes_division_of_focal_plane_polarimeter","49782392_Ex-vivo_characterization_of_human_colon_cancer_by_Mueller_polarimetric_imaging","26311592_Dead_pixel_replacement_in_LWIR_microgrid_polarimeters","26237727_Interpolation_strategies_for_reducing_IFOV_artifacts_in_microgrid_polarimeter_imagery","6929521_Review_of_passive_imaging_polarimetry_for_remote_sensing_applications","257533011_Calibration_methods_for_division-of-focal-plane_polarimeters","253885315_A_division_of_aperture_MWIR_imaging_polarimeter","253091697_Image_Interpolation_Methods_Evaluation_for_Division_of_Focal_Plane_Polarimeters","234335259_On_the_Composition_and_Resolution_of_Streams_of_Polarized_Light_from_different_Sources","230615603_Characterization_of_a_visible_spectrum_division-of-focal-plane_polarimeter","221774462_Bilinear_and_bicubic_interpolation_methods_for_division_of_focal_plane_polarimeters","51823043_Fabrication_of_a_dual-layer_aluminum_nanowires_polarization_filter_array","11463889_Liquid-crystal_micropolarizer_array_for_polarization-difference_imaging","5566169_Broadband_Division-of-Amplitude_Polarimeter_Based_on_Uncoated_Prisms","2348101_Modeling_and_estimation_of_FPN_components_in_CMOS_image_sensors"]}
