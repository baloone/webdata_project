{"id":"327918623_How_to_make_the_library_smart_The_conceptualization_of_the_smart_library","abstract":"Purpose\n\nThis paper aims to clearly conceptualize the idea of the smart library and propose a holistic approach to building smart libraries, in accordance with recent practices and state-of-the-art technologies.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\n\nDrawing on an extensive review of existing literature and practice about library construction, this paper distinguishes between similar types of smart library and divides the concepts associated with smart library building into three dimensions: technology, service and human.\n\nFindings\n\nTraditional libraries can transform to smart libraries by strategic design and implementation of advanced technologies, such as cloud computing, data mining and artificial intelligence, but they also need to consider service building, user cultivation and librarian training.\n\nOriginality/value\n\nAligning to the three main dimensions of smart libraries (technology, service and human), this study clarifies the concept of the smart library and offers strategic principles: integration of infrastructures, construction of service and human learning. It provides guidelines and directions for public and academic libraries committed to becoming smart libraries.","authors":["Gaohui Cao","Mengli Liang","Xuguang Li"],"meta":["September 2018The Electronic Library 36(8)","DOI:10.1108/EL-11-2017-0248"],"references":["313687426_WeChat_Library_A_new_mode_of_mobile_library_service","277968161_Mining_library_and_university_data_to_understand_library_use_patterns","273316307_The_Internet_of_Things_and_Convenience","269802115_Das_Projekt_Blended_Library_an_der_Universitatsbibliothek_Tubingen_-_ein_Statusbericht","267566519_Internet_of_Things_Strategic_Research_Roadmap","253646221_Sensing_as_a_Service_Model_for_Smart_Cities_Supported_by_Internet_of_Things","241703159_Multilinguality_in_the_digital_library_A_review","235296210_Intelligent_agent_concepts_in_the_modern_library","228968336_Intelligent_Agent_Architecture_for_Digital_Library","224157179_A_smarter_process_for_sensing_the_information_space","221096701_Usability_Analysis_in_Gesture_Operation_of_Interactive_E-Books_on_Mobile_Devices","220677434_Development_of_a_medical_digital_library_managing_multiple_collections","220677039_Using_data_mining_to_improve_digital_library_services","318751709_Smart_Library_Identifying_Books_on_Library_Shelves_Using_Supervised_Deep_Learning_for_Scene_Text_Reading","310671412_Smart_Library_Identifying_Books_in_a_Library_using_Richly_Supervised_Deep_Scene_Text_Reading","303883394_Internet_of_Things_-_potential_for_libraries","292647591_The_blended_librarian_in_the_learning_commons_New_skills_for_the_blended_library","289754202_Towards_the_Hybrid_Library","288045389_Next-generation_library_information_service_-_'smart_library'","287793224_The_blended_librarian_A_blueprint_for_redefining_the_teaching_and_learning_role_of_academic_librarians","267848464_Evaluating_users'_satisfaction_on_academic_library_performance","263254062_An_identification_of_a_model_for_digital_library_critical_success_factors","255203878_Smart_Libraries_Best_SQE_Practices_for_Libraries_with_an_Emphasis_on_Scientific_Computing","238703587_The_Ubiquitous_Library_for_the_Blind_and_Physically_Handicapped_-_a_case_study_of_the_LG_Sangnam_Library_Korea","236750824_The_Ubiquitous_Library_is_Here","221270604_SmartLibrary_-_Location-Aware_Mobile_Library_Service","220876581_From_Smart_Homes_to_Smart_Cities_Opportunities_and_Challenges_from_an_Industrial_Perspective","220677547_Digital_libraries_digital_containers_library_patrons_and_visions_for_the_future","220677342_Using_adaptive_resonance_theory_and_data-mining_techniques_for_materials_recommendation_based_on_the_e-library_environment","220677120_Using_data_mining_technology_to_provide_a_recommendation_service_in_the_digital_library","28802036_Intelligent_library_systems_artificial_intelligence_technology_and_library_automation_systems","27398818_Realizing_the_Hybrid_Library","3806239_Extending_the_role_of_metadata_in_a_digital_library_system"]}
