{"id":"332054901_Random_Waypoint_Mobility_Model_in_Space_Modulation_Systems","abstract":"In this letter, the impact of mobility on the performance of space modulation systems is presented and thoroughly studied. In particular, an exact closed-form expression for the pairwise error probability is derived and used to obtain an analytical expression for the average bit error rate along with its asymptotic one. In the analysis, the well-known and widely adopted random waypoint mobility model is considered. Some representative numerical examples are presented to investigate the impact of different system and channel parameters. Monte-Carlo simulation results are provided to substantiate the accuracy of the conducted analysis.","authors":["Saud Althunibat","Osamah S.
