{"id":"313205744_A_Design_Space_for_Spatio-Data_Coordination_Tangible_Interaction_Devices_for_Immersive_Information_Visualisation","abstract":"We introduce the concept of \" spatio-data coordination \" (SD coordination) which defines the mapping of user actions in physical space into the space of data in a visualisation. SD coordination is intended to lower the user's cognitive load when exploring complex multi-dimensional data such as biomedical data, multiple data attributes vs time in a space-time-cube visualisation, or three-dimensional projections of three-or-higher-dimensional data sets. To inform the design of interaction devices to allow for SD coordination, we define a design space and demonstrate it with sketches and early prototypes of three exemplar devices for SD coordinated interaction.","authors":["Maxime Cordeil","Benjamin Bach","Yongchao Li","Elliott Wilson"],"meta":["April 2017","DOI:10.1109/PACIFICVIS.2017.8031578","Conference: IEEE Pacific Visualization Symposium"],"references":["308715842_Bare-Hand_Volume_Cracker_for_Raw_Volume_Data_Analysis","306056635_Embedded_Data_Representations","301316439_A_Descriptive_Framework_for_Temporal_Data_Visualizations_Based_on_Generalized_Space-Time_Cubes_Generalized_Space-Time_Cube","283836697_The_possible_utility_of_stereoscopic_3D_displays_for_information_visualization_The_good_the_bad_and_the_ugly","314824819_Using_an_autonomous_cube_for_basic_navigation_and_input","308376248_Interactive_dynamics_for_visual_analysis","307572828_Categorizing_Issues_in_Mid-air_InfoVis_Interaction","305218416_Soli_Ubiquitous_Gesture_Sensing_with_Millimeter_Wave_Radar","289963533_Graphical_perception_Theory_experimentation_and_application_to_the_development_of_graphical_methods","283480338_Selection_of_Large-Scale_3D_Point_Cloud_Data_Using_Gesture_Recognition"]}
