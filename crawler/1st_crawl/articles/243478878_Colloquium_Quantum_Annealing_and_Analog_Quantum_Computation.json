{"id":"243478878_Colloquium_Quantum_Annealing_and_Analog_Quantum_Computation","abstract":"The recent success in quantum annealing, i.e., optimization of the cost or energy functions of complex systems utilizing quantum fluctuations is reviewed here. The concept is introduced in successive steps through studying the mapping of such computationally hard problems to classical spin-glass problems, quantum spin-glass problems arising with the introduction of quantum fluctuations, and the annealing behavior of the systems as these fluctuations are reduced slowly to zero. This provides a general framework for realizing analog quantum computation.","authors":["Arnab Das","Bikas Chakrabarti"],"meta":["September 2008Review of Modern Physics 80(3):1061-1081","DOI:10.1103/RevModPhys.80.1061","SourcearXiv","Project: Quantum Annealing"],"references":["259328922_Quenching_dynamics_of_a_quantum_XY_spin-_12_chain_in_a_transverse_field","257313812_The_travelling_salesman_problem_on_randomly_diluted_lattices_Results_for_small-size_systems","266517844_Statistical_Physics_of_Spin_Glasses_and_Information_Processing-An_Introduction","260899140_Computing_Quantum_to_classical_and_back","259066504_Quantum_Ising_Phases_and_Transitions_in_Transverse_Ising_Models","258098278_Quantum_Computation_and_Shor's_Factoring_Algorithm","258092099_From_classical_to_quantum_glass","258091263_Kinetic_Ising_Model_of_the_Glass_Transition","255904253_Quantum_Mechanics_Helps_in_Searching_for_a_Needle_in_a_Haystack","252564297_LETTER_TO_THE_EDITOR_Solving_the_Schrodinger_equation_for_the_Sherrington_-_Kirkpatrick_model_in_a_transverse_field"]}
