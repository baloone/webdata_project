{"id":"343147432_A_comprehensive_survey_of_the_Grasshopper_optimization_algorithm_results_variants_and_applications","abstract":"The grasshopper optimization algorithm is one of the dominant modern meta-heuristic optimization algorithms. It has been successfully applied to various optimization problems in several fields, including engineering design, wireless networking, machine learning, image processing, control of power systems, and others. We survey the available literature on the grasshopper optimization algorithm, including its modifications, hybridizations, and generalization to the binary, chaotic, and multi-objective cases. We review its applications, evaluate the algorithms, and provide conclusions.","authors":["Laith Abualigah","Ali Diabat"],"meta":["October 2020Neural Computing and Applications 32(19)","DOI:10.1007/s00521-020-04789-8"],"references":["337634950_Salp_swarm_algorithm_a_comprehensive_survey","334315614_A_feasibility_study_of_seabed_cover_classification_standard_in_generating_related_geospatial_data","332636834_Using_NSGA-III_for_optimising_biomedical_ontology_alignment","331552680_A_Parameter_Adaptive_MOMEDA_Method_Based_on_Grasshopper_Optimization_Algorithm_to_Extract_Fault_Features","330536936_Optimal_Power_Flow_Controller_for_Grid-Connected_Microgrids_using_Grasshopper_Optimization_Algorithm","347544345_An_Improved_Flower_Pollination_Algorithm_for_Global_Numerical_Optimization","332124044_Enhanced_salp_swarm_algorithm_Application_to_variable_speed_wind_generators","331055172_Grasshopper_optimization_algorithm-based_approach_for_the_optimization_of_ensemble_classifier_and_feature_selection_to_classify_epileptic_EEG_signals","330984518_Optimal_Placement_of_TCSC_for_Reactive_Power_Planning_Using_Grasshopper_Optimization_Algorithm_Considering_Line_Outage_N-M_Methods_and_Protocols","330832035_Grasshopper_Optimization_Algorithm_Theory_Literature_Review_and_Application_in_Hand_Posture_Estimation_Methods_and_Applications","330443929_Generation_and_transmission_expansion_management_using_grasshopper_optimization_algorithm","330300899_Modified_Grasshopper_Algorithm_Based_Multilevel_Thresholding_for_Color_Image_Segmentation","329913166_Feature_Selection_and_Enhanced_Krill_Herd_Algorithm_for_Text_Document_Clustering","329558562_Grasshopper_inspired_artificial_bee_colony_algorithm_for_numerical_optimisation","330066605_Renewable_Energy_Based_Economic_Emission_Load_Dispatch_Using_Grasshopper_Optimization_Algorithm"]}
