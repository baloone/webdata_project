{"id":"331602732_Accounting_students'_choice_of_blended_learning_format_and_its_impact_on_performance_and_satisfaction","abstract":"Using online platforms to deliver educational content, some institutions have developed blended courses that combine the advantages of online instruction with traditional face-to-face (F2F) teaching. This study compares accounting student performance and satisfaction in two blended formats with similar content and design, i.e. F2F+ vs. Online+ courses. It also assesses the characteristics of students who choose the latter option over F2F+ courses. Students in four advanced accounting subjects were surveyed and their course performance was obtained. Results indicate that the main determinants of studentsâ€™ decision to register for an Online+ course are retaking the course, increased weekly work hours, and belief that this type of blended course facilitates learning. Results show that students in advanced accounting courses with equivalent content and design perform similarly and have the same level of course satisfaction across course delivery formats, as hypothesized under equivalency theory.","authors":["Anne Fortin","Chantal Viger","Manon Deslandes","Antonello Callimaci"],"meta":["March 2019Accounting Education
