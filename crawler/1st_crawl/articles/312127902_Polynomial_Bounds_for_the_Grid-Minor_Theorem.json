{"id":"312127902_Polynomial_Bounds_for_the_Grid-Minor_Theorem","abstract":"One of the key results in Robertson and Seymour's seminal work on graph minors is the grid-minor theorem (also called the excluded grid theorem). The theorem states that for every grid H, every graph whose treewidth is large enough relative to |V(H)| contains H as a minor. This theorem has found many applications in graph theory and algorithms. Let f(k) denote the largest value such that every graph of treewidth k contains a grid minor of size (f(k) × f(k)). The best previous quantitative bound, due to recent work of Kawarabayashi and Kobayashi, and Leaf and Seymour, shows that f(k) = ω(√logk/loglogk). In contrast, the best known upper bound implies that f(k) = O(√k/logk). In this article, we obtain the first polynomial relationship between treewidth and grid minor size by showing that f(k) = Ω2(kδ) for some fixed constant δ > 0, and describe a randomized algorithm, whose running time is polynomial in |V(G)| and k, that with high probability finds a model of such a grid minor in G.","authors":["Chandra Chekuri","Julia Chuzhoy"],"meta":["December 2016Journal of the ACM 63(5)","DOI:10.1145/2820609"],"references":["266222227_Menger-type_results_for_three_or_more_vertices","265368257_Proof_of_a_conjecture_of_P_Erdos","221591209_On_partitioning_graphs_via_single_commodity_flows","220994913_Linear_min-max_relation_between_the_treewidth_of_H-minor-free_graphs_and_its_largest_grid","45862822_On_Brambles_Grid-Like_Minors_and_Parameterized_Intractability_of_Monadic_Second-Order_Logic","310822224_A_Polylogarithmic_Approximation_Algorithm_for_Edge-Disjoint_Paths_with_Congestion_2","307524790_Routing_in_Undirected_Graphs_with_Constant_Congestion","300571616_Excluded_Grid_Theorem","289089039_Poly-logarithmic_Approximation_for_Maximum_Node_Disjoint_Paths_with_Constant_Congestion","285929285_Algorithmic_Graph_Minor_Theory_Improved_Grid_Minor_Bounds_and_Wagner's_Contraction","268642744_Combinatorial_optimization_Polyhedra_and_efficiency_3_volumes","266562826_Tree-width_and_planar_minors","266560802_Degree-3_Treewidth_Sparsifiers","262212358_Minimizing_Congestion_in_General_Networks","258817865_Maximum_Edge-Disjoint_Paths_in_k-Sums_of_Graphs","248158816_Tree_width_and_tangles_A_new_connectivity_measure_and_some_applications","236118790_Large-Treewidth_Graph_Decompositions_and_Applications","230613613_A_Polylogarithmic_Approximation_Algorithm_for_Edge-Disjoint_Paths_with_Congestion_2","228057836_A_Reduction_Method_for_Edge-Connectivity_in_Graphs","226429331_On_a_connection_between_the_existence_ofk-trees_and_the_toughness_of_a_graph","225230287_Linearity_of_grid_minors_in_treewidth_with_applications_through_bidimensionality","223636717_Quickly_Excluding_a_Planar_Graph","222853908_Highly_Connected_Sets_and_the_Excluded_Grid_Theorem","222509237_Graph_minors_V_Excluding_a_planar_graph","222407074_Reconstructing_edge-disjoint_paths","221591915_Graph_Partitioning_using_Single_Commodity_Flows","221591525_Multicommodity_flow_well-linked_terminals_and_routing_problems","221498390_Approximation_Algorithms_for_the_Edge-Disjoint_Paths_Problem_via_Racke_Decompositions","220691205_Concentration_of_Measure_for_the_Analysis_of_Randomized_Algorithms","220616836_Edge_Disjoint_Paths_in_Moderately_Connected_Graphs","220431872_Graph_partitioning_using_single_commodity_flows","220076537_Graph_minors_X_Obstructions_to_tree-decomposition","51916403_Routing_in_Undirected_Graphs_with_Constant_Congestion","24013132_A_Graph_Reduction_Step_Preserving_Element-Connectivity_and_Applications","2916083_Expander_Flows_Geometric_Embeddings_and_Graph_Partitioning","2898051_Subexponential_Parameterized_Algorithms_on_Graphs_of_Bounded-Genus_and_H-Minor-Free_Graphs","2548504_Minimizing_Congestion_in_General_Networks"]}
