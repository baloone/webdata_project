{"id":"332105787_Effects_of_Multi-core_Processors_on_Linear_and_Binary_Search_Algorithms","abstract":"Searching is a problem that commonly arises in computer science. It is a process of checking and finding an element from the list of elements. Many search algorithms have been developed while existing ones have been improved upon to enhance their performance in terms of computational complexity, memory and other factors. In this paper the effect of multi-core processors on linear and binary search algorithms was investigated using System.nanotime() benchmark suits as the main method used; and some of java concurrency tools to measure the running times of linear and binary search algorithms on a single and multi-core machines. The results obtained shows that binary search is 1.98 times faster than linear search on a dual-core and 3.83 times faster on quad-core machine. It has thus been concluded that binary search is a better searching algorithm as compared to the linear search. In addition, increase in the number of processing cores significantly improves on the performance of both algorithms.","authors":["Abbas Muhammad Rabiu","Ahmed Baita Garko","Aisha Muhammad Abdullahi"],"meta":["December 2018","Project: Effects of Munlticore Processors on Some Sorting and Searching Algorithms"],"references":["350515341_A_Review_of_Architectures_-Intel_Single_Core_Intel_Dual_Core_and_AMD_Dual_Core_Processors_and_the_Benefits","281978797_Comparing_Linear_Search_and_Binary_Search_Algorithms_to_Search_an_Element_from_a_Linear_List_Implemented_through_Static_Array_Dynamic_Array_and_Linked_List","224346378_Backwards_Search_Algorithm_of_Double-Sorted_Inter-relevant_Successive_Trees","39765372_The_Art_of_Computer_Programming_Vol_3_Sorting_and_Searching"]}
