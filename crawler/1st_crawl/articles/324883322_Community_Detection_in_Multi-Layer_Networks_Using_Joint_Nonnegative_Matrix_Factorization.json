{"id":"324883322_Community_Detection_in_Multi-Layer_Networks_Using_Joint_Nonnegative_Matrix_Factorization","abstract":"Many complex systems are composed of coupled networks through different layers, where each layer represents one of many possible types of interactions. A fundamental question is how to extract communities in multi-layer networks. The current algorithms either collapses multi-layer networks into a single-layer network or extends the algorithms for single-layer networks by using consensus clustering. However, these approaches have been criticized for ignoring the connection among various layers, thereby resulting in low accuracy. To attack this problem, a quantitative function (multi-layer modularity density) is proposed for community detection in multi-layer networks. Afterward, we prove that the trace optimization of multi-layer modularity density is equivalent to the objective functions of algorithms, such as kernel \n$K$ \n-means, nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), spectral clustering and multi-view clustering, for multi-layer networks, which serves as the theoretical foundation for designing algorithms for community detection. Furthermore, a \nS \nemi-\nS \nupervised \nj \noint \nN \nonnegative \nM \natrix \nF \nactorization algorithm (\nS2-jNMF \n) is developed by simultaneously factorizing matrices that are associated with multi-layer networks. Unlike the traditional semi-supervised algorithms, the partial supervision is integrated into the objective of the S2-jNMF algorithm. Finally, through extensive experiments on both artificial and real world networks, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches for community detection in multi-layer networks.","authors":["Xiaoke Ma","Di Dong","Quan Wang"],"meta":["May 2018IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TKDE.2018.2832205"],"references":["320317708_Identifying_Condition-Specific_Modules_by_Clustering_Multiple_Networks","308062589_The_Dynamics_of_Viral_Marketing","287971691_Identifying_communities_from_multiplex_biological_networks","285668548_Gene_ontology_Tool_for_the_unification_of_biology","278196766_Detecting_hot_topics_from_Twitter_A_multiview_approach","275713165_Effectively_Predicting_Whether_and_When_a_Topic_Will_Become_Prevalent_in_a_Social_Network","275345862_Structural_reducibility_of_multilayer_networks","272521008_Disease_networks_Uncovering_disease-disease_relationships_through_the_incomplete_interactome","261922679_Modeling_Disease_Progression_Using_Dynamics_of_Pathway_Connectivity","260871895_An_Iterative_Fusion_Approach_to_Graph-Based_Semi-Supervised_Learning_from_Multiple_Views","258312304_Dimensionality_reduction_and_spectral_properties_of_multiplex_networks","257142871_Multilayer_Networks","231079488_Analysis_of_the_structure_of_complex_networks_at_different_resolution_levels","230973701_Non-traditional_spectral_clustering_algorithms_for_the_detection_of_community_structure_in_complex_networks_A_comparative_analysis","228656772_Eigenspaces_of_networks_reveal_the_overlapping_and_hierarchical_community_structure_more_precisely","228469445_Co-regularized_Multi-view_Spectral_Clustering","223980895_Consensus_clustering_in_complex_networks","221995234_Controlling_The_False_Discovery_Rate_-_A_Practical_And_Powerful_Approach_To_Multiple_Testing","221345914_Multi-View_Clustering_via_Canonical_Correlation_Analysis","221345117_A_Co-training_Approach_for_Multi-view_Spectral_Clustering_Abhishek_Kumar","45275132_Multirelational_Organization_of_Large-Scale_Social_Networks_in_an_Online_World","44596376_Community_Structure_in_Time-Dependent_Multiscale_and_Multiplex_Networks","41103157_Associating_Genes_and_Protein_Complexes_with_Disease_via_Network_Propagation","12752937_Learning_the_Parts_of_Objects_by_Non-Negative_Matrix_Factorization","12514438_Gene_ontology_tool_for_the_unification_of_biology_The_Gene_Ontology_Consortium","11613956_A_Combined_Experimental_and_Computational_Strategy_to_Define_Protein_Interaction_Networks_for_Peptide_Recognition_Modules","329476370_Controlling_the_False_Discovery_Rate_A_Practical_and_Powerful_Approach_to_Multiple_Testing","321331426_Multi-View_Clustering_via_Canonical_Correlation_Analysis","319499854_Semi-supervised_spectral_algorithms_for_community_detection_in_complex_networks_based_on_equivalence_of_clustering_methods","315303792_OLAK_an_efficient_algorithm_to_prevent_unraveling_in_social_networks","311160588_Efficient_Distance-Aware_Influence_Maximization_in_Geo-Social_Networks","306551976_HER2_expression_identifies_dynamic_functional_states_within_circulating_breast_cancer_cells","305779534_Null_Models_and_Modularity_Based_Community_Detection_in_Multi-Layer_Networks","300404533_Stability-driven_nonnegative_matrix_factorization_to_interpret_Spatial_gene_expression_and_build_local_gene_networks","280715148_The_BioGRID_interaction_database_2015_update","280243465_Multiway_spectral_community_detection_in_networks","279953559_Multi-View_Clustering_via_Joint_Nonnegative_Matrix_Factorization","269416241_Mining_Top_K_Spread_Sources_for_a_Specific_Topic_and_a_Given_Node","268817412_The_Structure_and_Dynamics_of_Multilayer_Networks","262292748_Multi-level_relationship_outlier_detection","243775745_Robust_Action_and_the_Rise_of_the_Medici","243767200_Learning_the_parts_of_objects_by_nonnegative_matrix_factorization","238635147_Robust_Action_and_the_Rise_of_the_Medici_1400-1434","225219990_Accelerating_spectral_clustering_with_partial_supervision","222538167_Semi-supervised_clustering_algorithm_for_community_structure_detection_in_complex_networks","221996591_The_PageRank_Citation_Ranking_Bringing_Order_to_the_Web","221945992_Community_structure_in_social_and_biological_networks","220401635_Spectral_K_-way_ratio-cut_partitioning_and_clustering","220049031_Normalized_Cuts_and_Image_Segmentation","45854744_Community_Detection_in_Graphs","6609402_Resolution_limit_in_community_detection","8525852_Protein_Complex_Prediction_via_Cost-based_Clustering","7659762_Finding_and_Evaluating_Community_Structure_in_Networks","6768757_Finding_Community_Structure_in_Networks_Using_the_Eigenvectors_of_Matrices","6124057_Projected_Gradient_Methods_for_NonNegative_Matrix_Factorization"]}
