This study main objective of the study: To prepare a Multimedia Package for developing Programming language in computer science. The effectiveness of the Multimedia Package in learning of programming language in computer science is evaluated. In this study using Quasi Experimental method, the sample of the present study is 60 students of standard XI from Sri Swamy Higher secondary School in Salem district. Thirty students were considered as Control group and thirty students were considered as Experimental group. Achievement test was used as tool for the study. It is found that there is a significant means score difference between pre-test and post-test among the higher secondary school students learning computer science. It is proved that Multimedia supported teaching is one of the appropriate and effective methods for teaching programming language in Computer Science in higher secondary school students. It is found that Multimedia Package is more effective than conventional methods. So multimedia can develop knowledge in programming language in computer science of higher secondary school students.","authors":["Indira P.","Dr K Dhanalakshmi","Research Scholar"],"meta":["January 2019","Projects: Effectiveness of Multimedia Package for  Enhancing Achievement in Computer Science  among XI Standard StudentsMultimedia package for teaching programming language in computer science among boys and girls of XI  standard studends"],"references":["308208110_A_STUDY_ON_THE_EFFECTIVENESS_OF_MULTIMEDIA_IN_TEACHING_COMPUTER_SCIENCE_AMONG_XI_STANDARD_STUDENTS_IN_KARUR_DISTRICT"]}
