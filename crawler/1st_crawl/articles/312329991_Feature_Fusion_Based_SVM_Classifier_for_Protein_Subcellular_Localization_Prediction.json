{"id":"312329991_Feature_Fusion_Based_SVM_Classifier_for_Protein_Subcellular_Localization_Prediction","abstract":"For the importance of protein subcellular localization in different branch of life science and drug discovery, researchers have focused their attentions on protein subcellular localization prediction. Effective representation of features from protein sequences plays most vital role in protein subcellular localization prediction specially in case of machine learning technique. Single feature representation like pseudo amino acid composition (PseAAC), physiochemical property model (PPM), amino acid index distribution (AAID) contains insufficient information from protein sequences. To deal with such problem, we have proposed two feature fusion representations AAIDPAAC and PPMPAAC to work with Support Vector Machine classifier, which fused PseAAC with PPM and AAID accordingly. We have evaluated performance for both single and fused feature representation of Gram-negative bacterial dataset. We have got at least 3% more actual accuracy by AAIDPAAC and 2% more locative accuracy by PPMPAAC than single feature representation.","authors":["Julia Rahman","Md. Nazrul Islam Mondal","Md.
