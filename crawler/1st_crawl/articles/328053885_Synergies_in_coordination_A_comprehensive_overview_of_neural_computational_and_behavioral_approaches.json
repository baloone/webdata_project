{"id":"328053885_Synergies_in_coordination_A_comprehensive_overview_of_neural_computational_and_behavioral_approaches","abstract":"At face value, the term 'synergy' provides a unifying concept within a fractured field that encompasses complementary neural, computational and behavioral approaches. However, the term is not used synonymously by different researchers, but has substantially different meanings depending on the research approach. With so many operational definitions for the one term, it becomes difficult to use as either a descriptive or explanatory concept, yet it remains pervasive and apparently indispensable. Here we provide a summary of different approaches that invoke 'synergies' in a descriptive or explanatory context, summarizing progress, not within the one approach, but across the theoretical landscape. Bernstein's framework of flexible hierarchical control may provide a unifying framework here, since it can incorporate divergent ideas about synergies. In the current motor control literature, 'synergy' may refer to conceptually different processes that could potentially operate in parallel, across different levels within the same hierarchical control scheme. There is evidence for the concurrent existence of synergies with different features, both 'hard-wired' and 'soft-wired', task-independent and task-dependent. By providing a comprehensive overview of the multifaceted ideas about synergies, our goal is to move away from the compartmentalization and narrow focus on one level and promote a broader perspective on the control and coordination of movement.","authors":["Michaela R Bruton","Nicholas J O'Dwyer"],"meta":["October 2018Journal of Neurophysiology
