{"id":"317129374_The_Watermark_Benchmark_for_Underwater_Acoustic_Modulation_Schemes","abstract":"Watermark is a freely available benchmark for physical-layer schemes for underwater acoustic communications. It allows researchers to test and compare algorithms for the physical layer under realistic and reproducible conditions. The benchmark is a shell around the validated channel simulator Mime, which is driven by at-sea measurements of the time-varying impulse response. The first release of Watermark is issued with a library of channels measured in Norway (two sites), France, and Hawaii, offering three frequency bands (4–8, 10–18, and 32.5–37.5 kHz), single-hydrophone and array receivers, and play times varying from 33 s to 33 min.","authors":["Paul A. van Walree","Francois-Xavier Socheleau","Roald Otnes","Trond Jenserud"],"meta":["May 2017IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering PP(99):1-12","DOI:10.1109/JOE.2017.2699078"],"references":["281416061_A_Parametric_Replay-Based_Framework_for_Underwater_Acoustic_Communication_Channel_Simulation","265129131_The_SUNSET_Framework_for_Simulation_Emulation_and_at-sea_Testing_of_Underwater_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","258449588_UComms_A_Conference_and_Workshop_on_Underwater_Communications_Channel_Modeling_and_Validation","6357733_Effects_of_ocean_thermocline_variability_on_non_coherent_underwater_acoustic_communications","315915123_Stochastic_replay_of_SIMO_underwater_acoustic_communication_channels","282175897_Underwater_Acoustic_Network_Simulation_With_Lookup_Tables_From_Physical-Layer_Replay","267221833_Channel_sounding_for_acoustic_communications_techniques_and_shallow-water_examples","261315021_Multiple-channel_detection_of_signals_having_known_rank","260672253_On_the_systematic_measurement_errors_of_correlative_mobile_radio_channel_sounders","260357085_Propagation_and_Scattering_Effects_in_Underwater_Acoustic_Communication_Channels","260357006_Statistical_Characterization_and_Computationally_Efficient_Modeling_of_a_Class_of_Underwater_Acoustic_Communication_Channels","260357005_Validation_of_Replay-Based_Underwater_Acoustic_Communication_Channel_Simulation","260357004_Ultrawideband_Underwater_Acoustic_Communication_Channels","260357001_Simulation_of_an_Underwater_Acoustic_Communication_Channel_Characterized_by_Wind-Generated_Surface_Waves_and_Bubbles","253451313_Acoustic_Ambient_Noise_in_the_Ocean_Spectra_and_Sources","242624905_Fundamentals_of_Statistical_Signal_Processing_Vol_II_Detection_Theory","242467844_Underwater_Ambient_Noise","224353334_A_Discrete-Time_Channel_Simulator_Driven_by_Measured_Scattering_Functions","224242663_Stochastic_Replay_of_Non-WSSUS_Underwater_Acoustic_Communication_Channels_Recorded_at_Sea","51698499_Stochastic_channel_simulator_based_on_local_scattering_functions","37406894_Statistical_Signal_Processing_Detection_Estimation_and_Time_Series_Analysis","5661026_A_High-frequency_warm_shallow_water_acoustic_communications_channel_model_and_measurements","3319752_Detection_of_an_unknown_rank-one_component_in_white_noise","3231161_Stochastic_simulation_of_acoustic_communication_in_turbulent_shallow_water","3230834_Phase-coherent_digital_communications_for_underwater_acoustic_channels"]}
