{"id":"265348650_Collaborative_Activity_Indicators_Engineering_Using_modeled_traces_in_the_context_of_Technology_Enhanced_Learning_Systems","abstract":"Designing and exploiting collaborative activity indicators is a strong challenge for Technology Enhanced Learning Systems (TELS). In this work we compute indicators using modeled traces transformation and we use to allow possible this computation a Trace Based System. We develop a managment TBS for Moodle. We propose an original model-driven approach, introducing the concepts of modeled traces (MT) and of trace-based system. In this approach, designing an indicator consists in explicitly modeling the trace to compute it, highlighting the elements of observation necessary to collect in order to elaborate a specific indicator. Therefore, effective implementation of an indicator consists in expliciting the transformations carried out of available traces on a particular learning platform. These initial observed elements (obsels) form what we call the primary modeled traces. A «path» of transformation is explicitly designed and applied for both documenting and performing the indicator computation. Using this approach, it is possible to form a library of enriched indicators models in association with the corresponding primary trace model and the explicit transformation path. Reusing an indicator in various contexts is easier and well documented. This approach is illustrated on the Moodle platform in order to explain the practical use of our implemented system.","authors":["Djouad Tarek","Alain Mille","Christophe Reffay","Benmohammed Mohamed"],"meta":[],"references":["281327763_Model-Driven_Engineering_MDE_and_Model-Driven_Architecture_MDA_applied_to_the_Modeling_and_Deployment_of_Technology_Enhanced_Learning_TEL_Systems_promises_challenges_and_issues","255616603_Une_theorie_de_la_trace_informatique_pour_faciliter_l'adaptation_dans_la_confrontation_logique_d'utilisationlogique_de_conception","228805734_Modellingspace_Interaction_Design_and_Architecture_of_a_Collaborative_Modelling_Environment","228588090_Helping_the_tutor_to_manage_a_collaborative_task_in_a_web-based_learning_environment","228344955_Analyser_l'activite_d'apprentissage_collaboratif_Une_approche_par_transformations_specialisees_de_traces_d'interactions","312941691_From_mirroring_to_guiding_A_review_of_the_state_of_art_technology_for_supporting_collaborative_learning","285890383_Raisonnement_fonde_sur_l'experience_en_supervision_industrielle","281328987_EM-AGIIR_un_Environnement_Multi-Agent_ouvert_pour_la_supervIsion_a_partir_d'Indicateurs_Reutilises","250199964_Peut-on_reperer_les_effets_de_l'apprentissage_collaboratif_a_distance","222962824_Group_mirrors_to_support_interaction_regulation_in_collaborative_problem_solving"]}
