{"id":"348328865_Integrated_Laycan_and_Berth_Allocation_and_time-invariant_Quay_Crane_Assignment_Problem_in_tidal_ports_with_multiple_quays","abstract":"Efficient management of port resources plays a crucial role in reducing vessel stay times and avoiding the payment of demurrage charges. In this paper, we focus on the integrated Laycan and Berth Allocation and Quay Crane Assignment Problem, which considers three main decision problems in port management in an integrated way: the Laycan Allocation Problem, the dynamic continuous Berth Allocation Problem and the time-invariant Quay Crane Assignment Problem. In a second part, the integrated problem is extended to the Specific Quay Crane Assignment, which includes the assignment of a set of specific quay cranes to each vessel, considering the productivity of quay cranes and their maximum outreach. The proposed integer programming models are original in several ways. First, the formulation of the models uses predicates which ensure flexibility in the implementation, and significantly improve the computational performance. The numerical study shows that the problems of practical size can be solved to optimality in a reasonable time using commercial software. Second, since the studied problems have different decision levels, a change of decision time-interval is incorporated inside the planning horizon for seamless decision-making. Third, to ensure that this integrated problem is as close as possible to reality, we consider both physical characteristics of the ports rarely studied together (tidal ports with multiple quays and different water depths) and contractual clauses (non-working periods and Charter Party clauses). The output of the models is an efficient schedule for berthing chartered vessels with an efficient quay crane assignment, and laycans to new vessels to charter.","authors":["Hamza Bouzekri","Gülgün Alpan","Vincent Giard"],"meta":["January 2021European Journal of Operational Research","DOI:10.1016/j.ejor.2020.12.056","Project: Management of a hybrid supply chain"],"references":["332958453_A_rolling_horizon_approach_for_the_integrated_multi-quays_berth_allocation_and_crane_assignment_problem_for_bulk_ports","318822579_A_novel_continuous_berth_scheduling_model_at_multiple_marine_container_terminals_with_tidal_considerations","317070004_The_multi-port_berth_allocation_problem_with_speed_optimization_and_emission_considerations","281169639_Integrated_Berth_Allocation_and_Quay_Crane_Assignment_Problem_Set_partitioning_models_and_computational_results","259004191_A_heuristics-based_solution_to_the_continuous_berth_allocation_and_crane_assignment_problem","257563135_Seaside_operations_in_container_terminals_Literature_overview_trends_and_research_directions","342994848_Integrated_Continuous_Berth_Allocation_and_Quay_Crane_Assignment_and_Scheduling_Problem_with_Time-Dependent_Physical_Constraints_in_Container_Terminals","329549993_Assessment_of_the_Impact_of_Charter_Party_Clauses_and_Port's_Characteristics_on_the_Port's_Financial_Result","328821181_New_exact_methods_for_the_time-invariant_berth_allocation_and_quay_crane_assignment_problem","320916779_Daily_berth_planning_in_a_tidal_port_with_channel_flow_control","317247048_MIP_approaches_for_the_integrated_berth_allocation_and_quay_crane_assignment_and_scheduling_problem","303714573_Berth_allocation_and_quay_crane_assignment_in_a_container_terminal_for_the_trade-off_between_time-saving_and_energy-saving","301756828_Optimal_Berth_Allocation_Time-variant_Quay_Crane_Assignment_and_Scheduling_with_Crane_Setups_in_Container_Terminals","301599182_Functional_integration_approach_for_the_berth_allocation_quay_crane_assignment_and_specific_quay_crane_assignment_problems","285672963_A_HPSO_for_solving_dynamic_and_discrete_berth_allocation_problem_and_dynamic_quay_crane_assignment_problem_simultaneously","277976684_The_continuous_Berth_Allocation_Problem_in_a_container_terminal_with_multiple_quays","277887897_A_new_continuous_berth_allocation_and_quay_crane_assignment_model_in_container_terminal","272419984_Modeling_the_Impacts_of_Tides_and_the_Virtual_Arrival_Policy_in_Berth_Allocation","272179623_A_follow-up_survey_of_berth_allocation_and_quay_crane_scheduling_problems_in_container_terminals","260033842_Optimal_berth_allocation_and_time-invariant_quay_crane_assignment_in_container_terminals","257177476_An_optimization_approach_for_coupling_problem_of_berth_allocation_and_quay_crane_assignment_in_container_terminal","227427257_Heuristics_for_the_integration_of_crane_productivity_in_the_berth_allocation_problem","226925491_The_berth_allocation_problem_Models_and_solution_methods","223882702_The_Simultaneous_Berth_and_Quay_Crane_Allocation_Problem","223353648_Integrating_berth_allocation_and_quay_crane_assignments","222509415_Ship_scheduling_The_last_decade","221950351_A_multi-mode_resource-constrained_scheduling_problem_in_the_context_of_port_operations","220384641_Model_and_heuristic_for_berth_allocation_in_tidal_bulk_ports_with_stock_level_constraints","220214664_An_enriched_model_for_the_integrated_berth_allocation_and_quay_crane_assignment_problem","46491681_A_survey_of_berth_allocation_and_quay_crane_scheduling_problems_in_container_terminals"]}
