{"id":"313057295_Detecting_lies_and_deceit_Pitfalls_and_opportunities_in_nonverbal_and_verbal_lie_detection","abstract":"People are generally poor at detecting deceit when observing someone’s behaviour or listening to their speech. In this chapter I will discuss the major factors (pitfalls) that lead to failures in catching liars: the sixteen reasons I will present are clustered into three categories: (i) a lack of motivation to detect lies; (ii) difficulties associated with lie detection; and (iii) common errors made by lie detectors. Discussing pitfalls provides insight into how lie detectors can improve their performance (for example, by recognising common biases and avoiding common judgment errors). The second section of this chapter discusses 11 ways (opportunities) to improve lie detection skills. Within this section, I first provide five recommendations for avoiding common errors in detecting lies. Next, I discuss recent lie detection research that introduces novel interview styles aimed at eliciting and enhancing verbal and nonverbal differences between liars and truth tellers. The recommendations are relevant in various settings, from the individual level (e.g., “Is my partner really working late?”) to the societal level (e.g., “Can we trust this suspect when he claims that he is not the serial rapist the police are searching for?”).","authors":["Aldert Vrij"],"meta":["January 2014","DOI:10.1515/9783110276794.321","In book: Interpersonal Communication (pp.321-346)"],"references":["247746041_Social_Skills_and_Deception_Ability","227868368_Crosscultural_Police-Citizen_Interactions_The_Influence_of_Race_Beliefs_and_Nonverbal_Communication_on_Impression_Formation1"]}
