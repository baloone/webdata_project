{"id":"265052275_Random_strings_and_tt-degrees_of_Turing_complete_CE_sets","abstract":"We investigate the truth-table degrees of (co-)c.e.\\ sets, in particular,\nsets of random strings. It is known that the set of random strings with respect\nto any universal prefix-free machine is Turing complete, but that truth-table\ncompleteness depends on the choice of universal machine. We show that for such\nsets of random strings, any finite set of their truth-table degrees do not meet\nto the degree~$\\mathbf0$, even within the \\ce truth-table degrees, but when\ntaking the meet over all such truth-table degrees, the infinite meet is\nindeed~$\\mathbf0$. The latter result proves a conjecture of Allender, Friedman\nand Gasarch. We also show that there are two Turing complete c.e.\\ sets whose\ntruth-table degrees form a minimal pair.","authors":["Mingzhong Cai","Rodney Downey","Rachel Epstein","Steffen Lempp"],"meta":["August 2014Logical Methods in Computer Science 10(3)","DOI:10.2168/LMCS-10(3:15)2014","SourcearXiv"],"references":["319393405_An_Introduction_to_Kolmogorov_Complexity_and_Its_Applications","228744736_Lecture_Notes_on_Descriptional_Complexity_and_Randomness","226536558_On_the_complexity_of_random_strings","220617226_Power_from_Random_Strings","220138152_Limits_on_the_Computational_Power_of_Random_Strings","45890493_Derandomizing_from_Random_Strings","250602860_tt-Degrees_of_recursively_enumerable_turing_degrees_II","250602844_The_existence_of_recursively_enumerable_minimal_truth-table_degrees","243076532_Relationships_between_reducibilities","230918472_ON_RECURSIVELY_ENUMERABLE_MINIMAL_BTT-DEGREES","225194190_Cupping_and_noncapping_in_the_re_weak_truth_table_and_turing_degrees","222593093_Kolmogorov_entropy_in_the_context_of_computability_theory","222507989_Process_complexity_and_effective_random_tests","220897657_Limits_on_the_Computational_Power_of_Random_Strings","220695019_An_introduction_to_Kolmogorov_complexity_and_its_applications_2nd_ed","220573555_Process_Complexity_and_Effective_Random_Tests","220395259_Some_theorems_on_the_algorithmic_approach_to_probability_theory_and_information_theory_1971_Dissertation_directed_by_AN_Kolmogorov","220394615_What_can_be_efficiently_reduced_to_the_Kolmogorov-random_strings","2770671_A_Theory_Of_Program_Size_Formally_Identical_To_Information_Theory","2279095_Degree_Theoretic_Definitions_Of_The_Low_2_Recursively_Enumerable_Sets"]}
