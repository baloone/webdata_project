{"id":"334319982_Penentuan_Kelas_Kata_Pada_Part_of_Speech_Tagging_Kata_Ambigu_Bahasa_Indonesia","abstract":"Indonesian hold a fundamental role in the communication. There is ambiguous problem in its machine learning implementation. In the Natural Language Processing study, Part of Speech (POS) tagging has a role in the decreasing this problem. This study use the Rule Based method to determine the best word class for ambiguous words in Indonesian. This research follows some stages: knowledge inventory, making algorithms, implementation, Testing, Analysis, and Conclusions. The first data used is Indonesian corpus that was developed by Language department of Computer science Faculty, Indonesia University. Then, data is processed and shown descriptively by following certain rules and specification. The result is a POS tagging algorithm included 71 rules in flowchart and descriptive sentence notation. Refer to testing result, the algorithm successfully provides 92 labeling of 100 tested words (92%). The results of the implementation are influenced by the availability of rules, word class tagsets and corpus data.","authors":["Ahmad Subhan Yazid","Agung Fatwanto"],"meta":["March 2018JISKA (Jurnal Informatika Sunan Kalijaga) 2(3):157","DOI:10.14421/jiska.2018.23-05"],"references":["220696279_Introduction_to_Chinese_Natural_Language_Processing","323717279_POS_Tagging_Bahasa_Indonesia_Dengan_HMM_dan_Rule_Based"]}
