{"id":"322708823_Development_of_an_adoption_model_to_assess_user_acceptance_of_e-service_technology_E-Service_Technology_Acceptance_Model","abstract":"With remarkable growth of ICT development and the Internet popularity, the widespread use of the electronic service is becoming inevitable. Furthermore, as the user adoption plays an important role for successful and effective implementation of any project, thus, there is a need to assess user acceptance of the e-service technology. This research developed the E-Service Technology Acceptance Model (ETAM) to assess the user acceptance of e-service technology. According to the literature review in the field of e-service technology and acceptance theories, this study identified the main factors influencing the acceptance of e-services, namely satisfaction, security and quality and then, dimensions of these factors were extracted from the previous studies. In order to categorise the dimensions, an exploratory survey was developed and conducted among the university students and then, the exploratory factor analysis was applied. Afterwards, a confirmatory survey was designed and conducted among the 427 Malaysians and tested in terms of validity (content and construct) and reliability and then used to evaluate the ETAM. Finally, the structural equation modelling was applied to validate the casual relations and to assess the goodness-of-fit. The results of this study revealed that quality, security and satisfaction significantly influenced the intention to use an e-service and consequently the acceptance of e-service technology. The ETAM can help evaluate and predict how users will respond to an e-service before starting the development of any e-service project. Additionally, ETAM can be used as a foundation for e-service providers to develop strategies to encourage people to use e-services and increase the usage and acceptance rate of e-services.","authors":["Hamed Taherdoost"],"meta":["January 2018Behaviour and Information Technology 37(2):1-25","DOI:10.1080/0144929X.2018.1427793","Project: Development of an Adoption Model to
