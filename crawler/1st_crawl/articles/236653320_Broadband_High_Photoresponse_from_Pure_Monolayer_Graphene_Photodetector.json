{"id":"236653320_Broadband_High_Photoresponse_from_Pure_Monolayer_Graphene_Photodetector","abstract":"Graphene has attracted large interest in photonic applications owing to its promising optical properties, especially its ability to absorb light over a broad wavelength range, which has lead to several studies on pure monolayer graphene-based photodetectors. However, the maximum responsivity of these photodetectors is below 10 mA W(-1), which significantly limits their potential for applications. Here we report high photoresponsivity (with high photoconductive gain) of 8.61 A W(-1) in pure monolayer graphene photodetectors, about three orders of magnitude higher than those reported in the literature, by introducing electron trapping centres and by creating a bandgap in graphene through band structure engineering. In addition, broadband photoresponse with high photoresponsivity from the visible to the mid-infrared is experimentally demonstrated. To the best of our knowledge, this work demonstrates the broadest photoresponse with high photoresponsivity from pure monolayer graphene photodetectors, proving the potential of graphene as a promising material for efficient optoelectronic devices.","authors":["Yongzhe Zhang","Tao Liu","Bo Meng","Xiaohui Li"],"meta":["May 2013Nature Communications 4(1):1811","DOI:10.1038/ncomms2830","SourcePubMed"],"references":["235457780_Evolution_of_the_Raman_Spectra_From_Single-_Few-_and_Many-Layer_Graphene_With_Increasing_Disorder","233395151_A_nanocomposite_ultraviolet_photodetector_based_on_interfacial_trap-controlled_charge_injection","232748782_Broadband_graphene_polarizer","231582274_Photo-excitation_Cascade_and_Multiple_Carrier_Generation_in_Graphene","263819152_A_high-speed_graphene-based_broadband_modulator","263519133_Infrared_spectroscopy_A_new_frontier_in_medicine","255795131_A_comparative_study_of_ultraviolet_photoconductivity_relaxation_in_zinc_oxide_ZnO_thin_films_deposited_by_different_techniques","255761258_Highly_sensitive_metal-insulator-semiconductor_UV_photodetectors_based_on_ZnOSiO2_core-shell_nanowires","234927436_Remote_infrared_radiation_detection_using_piezoresistive_microcantilevers","234063500_Coulomb_Blockade_and_Hopping_Conduction_in_Graphene_Quantum_Dots_Array"]}
