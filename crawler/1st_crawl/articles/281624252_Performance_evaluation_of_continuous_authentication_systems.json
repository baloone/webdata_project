{"id":"281624252_Performance_evaluation_of_continuous_authentication_systems","abstract":"In this study, the authors will describe how performance results for continuous authentication (CA) should be reported. Most research on alleged CA is in fact periodic authentication, and performance is then reported in false match and false non-match rates. Here the authors will describe average number of impostor or genuine actions as the performance indicators, and will describe a more detailed performance reporting method. The authorsâ€™ current results have been reported in continuous authentication, based on analysis performed on two different datasets, and compared those results to the best results in comparable research, where they show that their results outperform most other known results.","authors":["Soumik Mondal"],"meta":["September 2015IET Biometrics","DOI:10.1049/iet-bmt.2014.0070"],"references":["271496984_User_Authentication_Through_Biometric_Sensors_and_Decision_Fusion","241096418_What_is_behavior_And_so_what","239918246_Developing_a_Keystroke_Biometric_System_for_Continual_Authentication_of_Computer_Users","229034104_Continuous_and_non-intrusive_identity_verification_in_real-time_environments_based_on_free-text_keystroke_dynamics","224083480_A_novel_approach_to_design_of_user_re-authentication_systems","221609904_An_Efficient_User_Verification_System_via_Mouse_Movements","6576885_Performance_Generalization_in_Biometric_Authentication_Using_Joint_User-Specific_and_Sample_Bootstraps","3319165_User_authentication_through_typing_biometrics_features","307881957_LIBSVM_A_library_for_support_vector_machines","288961001_Continuous_authentication_using_keystroke_dynamics","283371346_Biometric_Systems","272623654_Libsvm","272436137_A_Computational_Approach_to_the_Continuous_Authentication_Biometric_System","261504392_Has_this_person_been_encountered_before_Modeling_an_anonymous_identification_system","261483059_De-duplication_errors_in_a_biometric_system_An_investigative_study","261428602_Combining_Mouse_and_Keystroke_Dynamics_Biometrics_for_Risk-Based_Authentication_in_Web_Environments","261243179_Continuous_authentication_for_mouse_dynamics_A_pattern-growth_approach","261102469_User_Identification_and_Authentication_using_Multi-Modal_Behavioral_Biometrics","259158499_Continuous_keystroke_dynamics_A_different_perspective_towards_biometric_evaluation","257932362_Continuous_authentication_using_mouse_dynamics","237148077_Biometric_Recognition_Based_on_Free-Text_Keystroke_Dynamics","236005648_User_identity_verification_via_mouse_dynamics","234809096_Biometric_Systems_Technology_Design_and_Performance_Evaluation","233734297_A_MATLAB_Toolbox_for_Self_Organizing_Maps_and_Supervised_Neural_Network_Learning_Strategies","230690256_A_MATLAB_Toolbox_for_Self_Organizing_Maps_and_Supervised_Neural_Network_Learning_Strategies","228715647_LIBSVM_A_library_for_support_vector_machines","224160755_Improving_Mouse_Dynamics_Biometric_Performance_Using_Variance_Reduction_via_Extractors_With_Separate_Features","220135431_Error_analysis_of_pattern_recognition_systems-the_subsets_bootstrap","48308210_Continuous_Identity_Verification_through_Keyboard_Biometrics","46298914_A_Long-Term_Trial_of_Keystroke_Profiling_Using_Digraph_Trigraph_and_Keyword_Latencies"]}
