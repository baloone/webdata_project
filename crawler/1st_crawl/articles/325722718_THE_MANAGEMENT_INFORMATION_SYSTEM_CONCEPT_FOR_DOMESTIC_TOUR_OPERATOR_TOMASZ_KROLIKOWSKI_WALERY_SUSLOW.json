{"id":"325722718_THE_MANAGEMENT_INFORMATION_SYSTEM_CONCEPT_FOR_DOMESTIC_TOUR_OPERATOR_TOMASZ_KROLIKOWSKI_WALERY_SUSLOW","abstract":"The purpose of the paper is to present the structured concept of management information system (MIS), dedicated to domestic (polish) tourism organizers. The system vision has been described in the form of domain ontology, structural and process conceptual models of the system, reflecting the key aspects of assisting the business of a tour operator. From the scientific point of view, the field examined by the authors is located at the border of economic and computer sciences, more particularly at the border of management and information fields. While developing the vision, the authors adopted the style of minute detailing of the main elements of the vision due to the lack of similar publications which could be used as support, especially for beginning designers of similar MISs.","authors":["Tomasz Królikowski","Walery Susłow"],"meta":["June 2018"],"references":["323348608_MANAGEMENT-INFORMATION_SYSTEMS","301148269_Customer_relationship_management_strategies","292740498_Handbook_on_ontologies_in_information_systems","274044275_Management_information_systems"]}
