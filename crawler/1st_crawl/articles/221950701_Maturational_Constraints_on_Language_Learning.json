{"id":"221950701_Maturational_Constraints_on_Language_Learning","abstract":"This paper suggests that there are constraints on learning required to explain the acquisition of language, in particular, mului ultonol constraints. First, empirical evidence for this daim is reviewed. The evidence from several studies of both first and second languoge acquisition suggests that normal language learning occurs only when exposure to the languoge begins early in life. With exposure beginning later in life, asymptotic performance in the language declines: the effects over oge of first exposure are approximately linear through childhood, with a flattening of the function in adulthood. These outcomes argue that some type of constraints ensuring successful languoge learning exist early in life, and weaken with increasing maturation. Second, two hypotheses are considered as to the nature of these maturational changes. One hypothesis is that constraints on learning particular to languoge acquisition undergo maturational decay. A second hypothesis, which is considered in more detail, suggests that language learning abilities decline because of the expansion of nonlinguisftc cognitive abilities.","authors":["Elissa L.
