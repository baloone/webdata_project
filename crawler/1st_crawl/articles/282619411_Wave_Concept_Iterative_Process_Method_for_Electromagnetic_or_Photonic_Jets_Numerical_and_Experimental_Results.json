{"id":"282619411_Wave_Concept_Iterative_Process_Method_for_Electromagnetic_or_Photonic_Jets_Numerical_and_Experimental_Results","abstract":"In this paper, we report the numerical and experimental observations of electromagnetic or photonic jets created by a planar metallic waveguide filled with dielectric and terminated by an elliptical tip. The theoretical framework of the study is based on the wave concept iterative process (WCIP) method formulated in the spatial domain. The analyzed structure is excited by the fundamental transverse electric mode of the waveguide. The accuracy and efficiency of our program are investigated; the results of the radiated power density show a good agreement compared with those given by finite element method (FEM) simulation. The tangential electric field is computed along the elliptical tip interface and in its vicinity, i.e., in the exterior area. The parameters of the electromagnetic jet phenomenon are investigated according to the geometrical and physical characteristics of the proposed structure. Our numerical simulations are in good agreement with the measurements, indicating that the electromagnetic jet can also be obtained in the microwave field.","authors":["Noemen Ammar","Taoufik Aguili","Henri Baudrand","Bruno Sauviac"],"meta":["November 2015IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation 63(11):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TAP.2015.2486800"],"references":["259008626_WCIP_method_applied_to_active_frequency_selective_surfaces","255572164_Analysis_of_multilayered_cylindrical_structures_using_a_full_wave_method","251999929_A_new_wave_concept_iterative_method_in_cylindrical_coordinates_for_modeling_of_circular_planar_circuits","259008753_Analysis_of_Frequency_Selective_Surface_on_IsotropicAnisotropic_Layers_Using_WCIP_Method","237792107_Analysis_of_cylindrically_conformal_microstrip_structures_using_an_iterative_method","230492863_Enhancement_of_Raman_scattering_by_individual_dielectric_microspheres","228910316_Robust_detection_of_deeply_subwavelength_pits_in_simulated_optical_data-storage_disks_using_photonic_jets","228878040_Experimental_Confirmation_of_Backscattering_Enhancement_Induced_by_a_Photonic_Jet","227225231_A_method_to_overcome_the_limitations_of_GO_in_axis-symmetric_dielectric_lens_shaping","224672303_Derivation_of_Multi-Grid_Discrete_and_Analytic_Green's_Functions_Free_of_Poles_in_Terms_of_Transverse_Waves"]}
