{"id":"284653608_Snakes_Active_Contour_Models","abstract":"A snake is an energy-minimizing spline guided by external constraint forces and influenced by image forces that pull it toward features such as lines and edges. Snakes are active contour models: they lock onto nearby edges, localizing them accurately. Scale-space continuation can be used to enlarge the capture region surrounding a feature. Snakes provide a unified account of a number of visual problems, including detection of edges, lines, and subjective contours, motion tracking, and stereo matching. The authors have used snakes successfully for interactive interpretation, in which user-imposed constraint forces guide the snake near features of interest.","authors":["Michael Kass","Andrew Witkin","Demetri Terzopoulos"],"meta":["January 1988International Journal of Computer Vision 1(4):321-331"],"references":[]}
