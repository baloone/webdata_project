{"id":"345145618_Reconfiguration_on_sparse_graphs","abstract":"A vertex-subset graph problem Q defines which subsets of the vertices of an input graph are feasible solutions. A reconfiguration variant of a vertex-subset problem asks, given two feasible solutions of size k, whether it is possible to transform one into the other by a sequence of vertex additions/deletions such that each intermediate set remains a feasible solution of size bounded by k. We study reconfiguration variants of two classical vertex-subset problems, namely Independent Set and Dominating Set. We denote the former by and the latter by . Both and are PSPACE-complete on graphs of bounded bandwidth and W[1]-hard parameterized by k on general graphs. We show that is fixed-parameter tractable parameterized by k when the input graph is of bounded degeneracy or nowhere dense. For , we show the problem fixed-parameter tractable parameterized by k when the input graph does not contain large bicliques.","authors":["Daniel Lokshtanov","Amer Mouawad","Fahad Panolan","Ramanujan M S"],"meta":["August 2018Journal of Computer and System Sciences 95(1):122-131","DOI:10.1016/j.jcss.2018.02.004"],"references":["309022765_Kernelization_Using_Structural_Parameters_on_Sparse_Graph_Classes","268452187_Kernelization_and_Sparseness_the_case_of_Dominating_Set","263427045_Fixed-Parameter_Tractability_of_Token_Jumping_on_Planar_Graphs","259220468_The_Complexity_of_Change","258520812_Deciding_first-order_properties_of_nowhere_dense_graphs","220548745_Finding_Paths_Between_3-Colorings","220315971_First_Order_Properties_on_Nowhere_Dense_Structures","45864029_Domination_Problems_in_Nowhere-Dense_Classes_of_Graphs","24167162_Solving_Dominating_Set_in_Larger_Classes_of_Graphs_FPT_Algorithms_and_Polynomial_Kernels","1959913_The_Connectivity_of_Boolean_Satisfiability_Computational_and_Structural_Dichotomies","319133958_Token_Jumping_in_Minor-Closed_Classes","302917812_On_the_Parameterized_Complexity_of_Reconfiguration_Problems","285941830_Characterisations_of_nowhere_dense_graphs","268652396_k_-Degenerate_Graphs","265775719_On_the_Parameterized_Complexity_for_Token_Jumping_on_Graphs","262163267_FPT_Algorithms_for_Domination_in_Biclique-Free_Graphs","257145040_Complexity_of_independent_set_reconfigurability_problems","243733877_Intersection_Theorems_for_Systems_of_Sets","226495878_Structural_Properties_of_Sparse_Graphs","224943672_Flip_Distance_Between_Two_Triangulations_of_a_Point-Set_is_NP-complete","224836520_Rerouting_shortest_paths_in_planar_graphs","222536651_Homomorphism_Preservation_on_Quasi-Wide_Classes","222525825_Flips_in_planar_graphs","220152460_On_the_Complexity_of_Reconfiguration_Problems","24142619_Rotation_Distance_is_Fixed-Parameter_Tractable","1739307_Linear_Time_Algorithms_for_Finding_a_Dominating_Set_of_Fixed_Size_in_Degenerated_Graphs"]}
