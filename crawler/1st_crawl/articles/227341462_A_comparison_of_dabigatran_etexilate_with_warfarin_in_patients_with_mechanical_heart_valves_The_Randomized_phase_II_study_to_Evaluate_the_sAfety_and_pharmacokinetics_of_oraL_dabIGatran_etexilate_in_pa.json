Initial doses of dabigatran will be based on the estimated creatinine clearance, and the doses will be adjusted based on measuring trough dabigatran plasma levels to achieve levels ≥ 50 ng/mL at steady state. Doses will range between 150 mg twice a day and 300 mg twice a day. Warfarin management and target international normalized ratio will be according to current practice guidelines at the discretion of the treating physicians. The plan is to treat 270 patients with dabigatran etexilate for a total study population of approximately 405 patients. Clinical efficacy and safety outcomes will be analyzed in an exploratory manner.\nRE-ALIGN is the first study to test an alternative to warfarin in patients with mechanical heart valves. A definitive phase III study will be planned based on the results of this study.","authors":["Frans Van de werf","Martina Brueckmann","Stuart J Connolly","Jeffrey Friedman"],"meta":["June 2012American Heart Journal 163(6):931-937.e1","DOI:10.1016/j.ahj.2012.03.011","SourcePubMed"],"references":["279338613_Guidelines_on_the_management_of_valvular_heart_disease_The_Task_Force_on_the_Management_of_Valvular_Heart_Disease_of_the_European_Society_of_Cardiology","227927206_Definition_of_major_bleeding_in_clinical_investigations_of_antihemostatic_medicinal_products_in_non-surgical_patients","49738791_Standardized_endpoint_definitions_for_Transcatheter_Aortic_Valve_Implantation_clinical_trials_A_consensus_report_from_the_Valve_Academic_Research_Consortium","40453302_Dabigatran_Versus_Warfarin_in_the_Treatment_of_Acute_Venous_Thromboembolism","26777612_Dabigatran_versus_Warfarin_in_Patients_with_Atrial_Fibrillation","26665755_Optimal_Level_of_Oral_Anticoagulant_Therapy_for_the_Prevention_of_Arterial_Thrombosis_in_Patients_With_Mechanical_Heart_Valve_Prostheses_Atrial_Fibrillation_or_Myocardial_Infarction","302966701_Focused_update_incorporated_into_the_ACCAHA_2006_guidelines_for_the_management_of_patients_with_valvular_heart_disease","251593364_Standardized_Endpoint_Definitions_for_Transcatheter_Aortic_Valve_Implantation_Clinical_Trials_A_Consensus_Report_From_the_Valve_Academic_Research_Consortium","222066222_Decreasing_warfarin_sensitivity_during_the_first_three_months_after_heart_valve_surgery_Implications_for_dosing","221685438_A_combined_pharmacometric_analysis_of_dabigatran_etexilate_in_healthy_volunteers_and_patients_with_atrial_fibrillation_or_undergoing_orthopaedic_surgery","51697857_Population_pharmacokinetic_analysis_of_the_oral_thrombin_inhibitor_dabigatran_etexilate_in_patients_with_non-valvular_atrial_fibrillation_from_the_RE-LY_trial","51679236_Dabigatran_Etexilate_in_Atrial_Fibrillation_Patients_With_Severe_Renal_Impairment_Dose_Identification_Using_Pharmacokinetic_Modeling_and_Simulation","51401952_Valvular_and_Structural_Heart_Disease","51130979_Risk_of_Bleeding_With_2_Doses_of_Dabigatran_Compared_With_Warfarin_in_Older_and_Younger_Patients_With_Atrial_Fibrillation_An_Analysis_of_the_Randomized_Evaluation_of_Long-Term_Anticoagulant_Therapy_RE","50830914_Effectiveness_of_dabigatran_etexilate_for_thromboprophylaxis_of_mechanical_heart_valves","47675161_Newly_identified_events_in_the_RE-LY_Trial_letter","38069752_Aortic_Valve_Replacement_A_Prospective_Randomized_Evaluation_of_Mechanical_Versus_Biological_Valves_in_Patients_Ages_55_to_70_Years","31027133_Intensity_of_oral_anticoagulation_after_implantation_of_St_Jude_Medical_aortic_prosthesis_analysis_of_the_GELIA_Database_GELIA_4","26744841_Antithrombotic_management_of_patients_with_prosthetic_heart_valves_Current_evidence_and_future_trends","24011517_Antithrombotic_management_in_patients_with_prosthetic_valves_A_comparison_of_American_and_European_guidelines","23285857_ACCAHA_2006_guidelines_for_the_management_of_patients_with_valvular_heart_disease_Executive_summary_A_report_of_the_American_College_of_CardiologyAmerican_Heart_Association_Task_Force_on_Practice_Guid","14884852_Thromboembolic_and_bleeding_complications_in_patients_with_mechanical_heart_valve_prostheses","7904943_Pharmacokinetic_Profile_of_the_Oral_Direct_Thrombin_Inhibitor_Dabigatran_Etexilate_in_Healthy_Volunteers_and_Patients_Undergoing_Total_Hip_Replacement","5561380_International_Normalized_Ratio_Self-Management_Lowers_the_Risk_of_Thromboembolic_Events_After_Prosthetic_Heart_Valve_Replacement","5452439_Clinical_Pharmacokinetics_and_Pharmacodynamics_of_the_Oral_Direct_ThrombinInhibitor_Dabigatran_Etexilate"]}
