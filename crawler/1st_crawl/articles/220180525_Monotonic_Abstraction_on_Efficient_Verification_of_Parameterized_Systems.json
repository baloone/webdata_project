{"id":"220180525_Monotonic_Abstraction_on_Efficient_Verification_of_Parameterized_Systems","abstract":"We introduce the simple and efficient method of monotonic abstraction to prove safety properties for parameterized systems with linear topologies. A process in the system is a finite-state automaton, where the transitions are guarded by both local and global conditions. Processes may communicate via broadcast, rendez-vous and shared variables over finite domains. The method of monotonic abstraction derives an over-approximation of the induced transition system that allows the use of a simple class of regular expressions as a symbolic representation. Compared to traditional regular model checking methods, the analysis does not require the manipulation of transducers, and hence its simplicity and efficiency. We have implemented a prototype that works well on several mutual exclusion algorithms and cache coherence protocols. 1.","authors":["Parosh Aziz Abdulla","Giorgio Delzanno","Noomene Ben Henda","Ahmed Rezine"],"meta":["October 2009International Journal of Foundations of Computer Science 20(5):779-801","DOI:10.1142/S0129054109006887","SourceDBLP"],"references":["284044719_AUTOMATA-THEORETIC_APPROACH_TO_AUTOMATIC_PROGRAM_VERIFICATION","238648329_Liveness_with_0_1_Counter_Abstraction","226220736_Iterating_Transducers","226027974_Liveness_with_01_-_Counter_Abstraction","225132750_Parameterized_Verification_of_a_Cache_Coherence_Protocol_Safety_and_Liveness","284860296_Undecidable_problems_in_unreliable_computations","238717639_Ordering_by_Divisibility_in_Abstract_Algebras","234807858_Computation_Finite_and_Infinite_Machines","225927367_Using_partial_orders_for_the_efficient_verification_of_deadlock_freedom_and_safety_properties","225909779_Iterating_Transducers_in_the_Large"]}
