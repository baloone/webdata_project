It may progressively become such an instrument along a professional genesis of use on teachers' side. Using both the notions of distance and double genesis, the case study described in this paper illustrates the beginning of such a genesis and the complexity that comes along with it.","authors":["Mariam Haspekian"],"meta":["February 2011","Conference: Proceedings of the Seventh Congress of the European Society for Research in Mathematics EducationAt: Poland"],"references":["226602743_Integrating_Technology_into_Mathematics_Education_Theoretical_Perspectives","226416521_An_Instrumental_Approach_to_Study_the_Integration_of_a_Computer_Tool_Into_Mathematics_Teaching_the_Case_of_Spreadsheets","226262115_Learning_Mathematics_in_a_CAS_Environment_The_Genesis_of_a_Reflection_about_Instrumentation_and_the_Dialectics_between_Technical_and_Conceptual_Work","266496666_TEACHERS_TECHNOLOGIES_AND_THE_STRUCTURES_OF_SCHOOLING","49969771_Integrating_technology_into_mathematics_education_Theoretical_perspectives"]}
