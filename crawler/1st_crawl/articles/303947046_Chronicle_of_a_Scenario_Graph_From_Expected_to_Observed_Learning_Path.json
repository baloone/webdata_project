{"id":"303947046_Chronicle_of_a_Scenario_Graph_From_Expected_to_Observed_Learning_Path","abstract":"This paper proposes an analysis of student paths into the scenario graph for a learning game that uses a formal model of seri- ous games understandable and usable by teachers. Screenwriting, im- plemented with a mental map, includes an expected path: the one that includes the most interesting nodes of the scenario graph from the point of view of the teacher, and achieves the training objectives. Through the analysis of the paths taken by the students, we will show the advantages and the benefits of this screenwriting. For that we indicate the different paths, the exit points (nodes presenting the case of abandonment of the student) and the various categories of paths (with achievement or non- achievement of training objectives). Finally, we propose solutions (tools and methods) to improve the reengineering process and the design of the scenario by the teachers.","authors":["Mathieu Vermeulen","Nadine Mandran","Jean-marc Labat"],"meta":["September 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-45153-4_24","Conference: 11th European Conference on Technology Enhanced Learning, EC-TEL 2016At: Lyon"],"references":["305513119_DOP8_merging_both_data_and_analysis_operators_life_cycles_for_technology_enhanced_learning","273693305_Origins_of_Serious_Games","271202711_Modeles_et_outils_pour_la_conception_de_jeux_serieux_une_approche_meta-design","269304223_Serious_games_as_edX_MOOC_activities","262370367_The_Six_Facets_of_Serious_Game_Design_A_Methodology_Enhanced_by_Our_Design_Pattern_Library","261244194_MoPPLiq_A_Model_for_Pedagogical_Adaptation_of_Serious_Game_Scenarios","253239436_Building_on_the_Case_Teaching_Method_to_Generate_Learning_Games_Relevant_to_Numerous_Educational_Fields","220428467_Interoperability_for_LMS_The_Missing_Piece_to_Become_the_Common_Place_for_Elearning_Innovation","308254271_An_introduction_to_Serious_Game_Definitions_and_Concepts","281049878_Learning_Role-Playing_Games_methodologie_et_formalisme_de_description_pour_l'assistance_a_la_conception_-_Premiers_resultats_d'experimentation","280680502_DOP8_Cycle_Merging_both_data_and_analysis_operators_life_cycles_for_Technology_Enhanced_Learning","267154727_Model_and_Authoring_Tool_to_Help_Teachers_Adapt_Serious_Games_to_their_Educational_Contexts","250131762_Modeling_Tracks_for_the_Model_Driven_Reengineering_of_a_TEL_System","235270257_Practical_barriers_in_using_educational_computer_games","234812017_Serious_Games_Games_That_Educate_Train_and_Inform","234650762_Serious_Games","220969578_A_Taxonomy_for_Scenario-Based_Engineering"]}
