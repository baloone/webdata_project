{"id":"222492018_Difference_graphs","abstract":"A graph G=(V, E) is said to be a difference graph if there exist real numbers a1, a2,…, an associated with the vertices of G and a positive real number T such that 1.(1) ¦ai¦<T for i=1, 2,…, n;2.(2) distinct vertices i and j are adjacent if and only if ¦ai−aj¦≥T.It can be shown that difference graphs are bipartite. Properties of difference graphs are given in Section 2. It turns out that they are very similar to threshold graphs. Section 3 describes the polytope of bipartite degree sequences with a given bipartition, and shows that its extreme points are exactly the degree sequences of the difference graphs with the same bipartition. Moreover, these degree sequences are characterized by a certain nonmajorizability property. In Section 4 we give an algorithm to recognize potentially difference degree sequences when the bipartition is unknown.","authors":["Peter L. Hammer","Uri N.
