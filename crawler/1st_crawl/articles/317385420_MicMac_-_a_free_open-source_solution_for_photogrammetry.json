{"id":"317385420_MicMac_-_a_free_open-source_solution_for_photogrammetry","abstract":"The publication familiarizes the reader with MicMac - a free, open-source photogrammetric software for 3D\nreconstruction. A brief history of the tool, its organisation and unique features vis-à-vis other software tools are in the\nhighlight. The essential algorithmic aspects of the structure from motion and image dense matching problems are\ndiscussed from the implementation and the user’s viewpoints.","authors":["Ewelina Rupnik","Mehdi Daakir","Marc Pierrot Deseilligny"],"meta":["June 2017Open Geospatial Data Software and Standards 2(14):1-9","DOI:10.1186/s40965-017-0027-2"],"references":["266278192_A_multiresolution_and_optimization-based_image_matching_approach_An_application_to_surface_reconstruction_from_SPOT5-HRS_stereo_imagery","261622957_Global_Fusion_of_Relative_Motions_for_Robust_Accurate_and_Scalable_Structure_from_Motion","228808857_APERO_an_open_source_bundle_adjusment_software_for_automatic_calibration_and_orientation_of_set_of_images","319770714_Photo_tourism_Exploring_photo_collections_in_3D","313527089_Distinctive_image_features_from_scale-invariant_key_points","313411146_Global_robust_image_rotation_from_combined_weighted_averaging","285906939_Numerical_optimization","277603529_Hierarchical_structure-and-motion_recovery_from_uncalibrated_images","273474060_Editorial_Computer_Vision_and_Photogrammetry_Interaction_or_Introspection","247935986_Computer_Vision_Algorithms_and_Applications"]}
