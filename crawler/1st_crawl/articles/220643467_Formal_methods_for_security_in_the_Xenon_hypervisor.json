{"id":"220643467_Formal_methods_for_security_in_the_Xenon_hypervisor","abstract":"This paper reports on the Xenon project’s use of formal methods. Xenon is a higher-assurance secure hypervisor based on re-engineering\nthe Xen open-source hypervisor. The Xenon project used formal specifications both for assurance and as guides for security\nre-engineering. We formally modelled the fundamental definition of security, the hypercall interface behaviour, and the internal\nmodular design. We used three formalisms: CSP, Z, and Circus for this work. Circus is a combination of Standard Z, CSP with its semantics given in Hoare and He’s unifying theories of programming. Circus is suited for both event-based and state-based modelling. Here, we report our experiences to date with using these formalisms\nfor assurance.","authors":["Leo Freitas","John P Mcdermott"],"meta":["October 2011International Journal on Software Tools for Technology Transfer 13(5):463-489","DOI:10.1007/s10009-011-0195-9","SourceDBLP"],"references":["235118057_Xenon_Formal_Security_Policy_Model","224001337_Using_Z_Specification_Proof_and_Refinement","221632117_Non-Interference_Through_Determinism","221046313_Building_a_MAC-Based_Security_Architecture_for_the_Xen_Open-Source_Hypervisor","220910193_SeL4_Formal_verification_of_an_OS_kernel","220692339_Modelling_and_analysis_of_security_protocols","220431839_A_Theory_of_Communicating_Sequential_Processes","220420663_seL4_Formal_Verification_of_an_Operating-System_Kernel","220367686_A_Denotational_Semantics_for_Circus","220269439_A_formal_security_policy_for_Xenon","220102598_Mechanising_Mondex_with_ZEves","220065574_Non-interference_through_Determinism","200032080_The_Theory_and_Practice_of_Concurrency","31594389_Refinement_Calculus_A_Systematic_Introduction","3560161_General_theory_of_composition_for_trace_sets_closed_under_selective_interleaving_functions","2922888_A_Separation_Kernel_Formal_Security_Policy","264922717_Using_Z_Specification_Refinement_and_Proof_Prentice-Hall_International_Series_in_Computer_Science","245805381_Communicating_Sequential_Processes","242561548_Refinement_calculus_a_systematic_introduction_graduate_texts_in_computer_science","234805906_The_Definitive_Guide_to_the_Xen_Hypervisor","234775191_Security_Engineering_A_Guide_to_Building_Dependable_Distributed_Systems","228911947_Xen_security_modules_xsm","226295172_A_UTP_semantics_for_circus","224123412_Fine-Grained_Inspection_for_Higher-Assurance_Software_Security_in_Open_Source","222904609_Re-engineering_Xen_internals_for_higher-assurance_security","222117495_Mechanising_a_formal_model_of_flash_memory","221609251_The_framework_of_selective_interleaving_functions_and_the_modular_assembly_kit","221267843_Verifying_the_Microsoft_Hyper-V_Hypervisor_with_VCC","220910066_Xen_and_the_art_of_virtualization","220695904_Communicating_Sequential_Processes","220432312_A_Linear_Time_Algorithm_for_Deciding_Subject_Security","220130615_A_Chain_Datatype_in_Z","213888004_A_lattice_model_of_secure_information_flow","37794702_A_Direct_Path_to_Dependable_Software","2923693_Xen_and_the_Art_of_Virtualization","2285587_Modelling_and_Analysis_of_Security_Protocols"]}
