{"id":"345990199_Social_Skills_Training_for_Autism_Spectrum_Disorder_a_Meta-analysis_of_In-person_and_Technological_Interventions","abstract":"Social skills training (SST) for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has traditionally focused on face-to-face (F2F-SST) interventions. Recently, Behavioral Intervention Technologies (BITs-SST) have been utilized to target social skills deficits using computer-based programs, avatars, and therapeutic robots. The present meta-analysis reviews recent evidence and compares the efficacy of 14 F2F-SST and four identified BITs-SST intervention trials for youth with ASD. These preliminary analyses did not indicate significant differences between F2F-SST and BITs-SST, with effect sizes consistently in the medium to high range (g = 0.81 and g = 0.93, respectively). These findings provide initial support for the continued investigation of BITs for providing SST to youth with ASD.","authors":["Erin Soares","Kimberly Bausback","Charlotte Beard","Megan Kay Higinbotham"],"meta":["March 2021Journal of Technology in Behavioral Science 6(4)","DOI:10.1007/s41347-020-00177-0"],"references":["344672990_Current_Trends_in_Telehealth_Applications_to_Deliver_Social_Communication_Interventions_for_Young_Children_with_or_at_Risk_for_Autism_Spectrum_Disorder","327211117_Learning_How_to_Make_Friends_for_Chinese_Adolescents_with_Autism_Spectrum_Disorder_A_Randomized_Controlled_Trial_of_the_Hong_Kong_Chinese_Version_of_the_PEERSR_Intervention","326540443_Social_skills_group_training_in_children_with_autism_spectrum_disorder_a_randomized_controlled_trial","325068826_Long-term_social_skills_group_training_for_children_and_adolescents_with_autism_spectrum_disorder_a_randomized_controlled_trial","323233607_Exploring_the_Effectiveness_of_a_Peer-Mediated_Model_of_the_PEERS_Curriculum_A_Pilot_Randomized_Control_Trial","321195662_A_Randomized_Controlled_Trial_of_the_Social_Tools_And_Rules_for_Teens_START_Program_An_Immersive_Socialization_Intervention_for_Adolescents_with_Autism_Spectrum_Disorder","335470133_RoB_2_A_revised_tool_for_assessing_risk_of_bias_in_randomised_trials","326947149_A_Randomized_Controlled_Trial_evaluating_the_Hebrew_Adaptation_of_the_PEERSR_Intervention_Behavioral_and_Questionnaire-Based_Outcomes","323424582_Statistical_power_analysis_for_the_behavioral_sciences","322108678_Smartphone_Apps_for_Autism_Spectrum_Disorder-Understanding_the_Evidence","316836942_Social_Skills_Training_for_Children_and_Adolescents_With_Autism_Spectrum_Disorder_A_Randomized_Controlled_Trial","312923945_Attitudes_towards_digital_treatment_for_depression_A_European_stakeholder_survey","320596143_Introduction_to_meta-analysis","316653347_Social_skills_training_for_children_with_autism_spectrum_disorder_using_a_robotic_behavioral_intervention_system_Social_Skills_Training_for_Children_with_ASD","312504953_Efficacy_of_group_social_skills_interventions_for_youth_with_autism_spectrum_disorder_A_systematic_review_and_meta-analysis"]}
