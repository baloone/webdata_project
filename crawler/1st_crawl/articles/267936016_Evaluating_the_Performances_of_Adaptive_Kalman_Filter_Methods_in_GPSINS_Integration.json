{"id":"267936016_Evaluating_the_Performances_of_Adaptive_Kalman_Filter_Methods_in_GPSINS_Integration","abstract":"One of the most important tasks in integration of GPS/INS is to choose the realistic dynamic model covariance matrix Q and measurement noise covariance matrix R for use in the Kalman filter. The performance of the methods to estimate both of these matrices depends entirely on the minimization of dynamic and measurement update errors that lead the filter to converge. This paper evaluates the performances of adaptive Kalman filter methods with different adaptations. Innovation and residual based adaptive Kalman filters were employed for adapting R and Q. These methods were implemented in a loose GPS/INS integration system and tested using real data sets. Their performances have been evaluated and compared. Their limitations in real-life engineering applications are discussed.","authors":["Ali Almagbile","Jinling Wang","Weidong Ding"],"meta":["June 2010Journal of Global Positioning Systems 9(1)","DOI:10.5081/jgps.9.1.33"],"references":["254394164_Adaptive_Kalman_Filtering_for_Vehicle_Navigation","231880178_An_Adaptive_Kalman_Filter_Based_on_Sage_Windowing_Weights_and_Variance_Components","224969508_System_Design_and_Performance_Analysis_of_Extended_Kalman_Filter_Based_Ultra-Tight_GPSINS_Integration","215530687_Improving_Adaptive_Kalman_Estimation_in_GPSINS_Integration","247065910_Optimal_Filtering_of_Pseudoranges_and_Phases_from_Single-Frequency_GPS_Receivers","228453025_Stochastic_modeling_of_the_chemostat","215721589_Stochastic_Models_Estimation_and_Control","215530742_Adaptive_Kalman_filtering_for_INSGPS","3114956_Stochastic_Models_Estimation_and_Control_Volume_I","3026116_On-Line_Identification_of_Linear_Dynamic_Systems_with_Applications_to_Kalman_Filtering"]}
