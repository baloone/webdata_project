{"id":"350316824_The_adaptation_validation_and_application_of_a_methodology_for_estimating_the_added_sugar_content_of_packaged_food_products_when_total_and_added_sugar_labels_are_not_mandatory","abstract":"Nutrition policies recommend limiting the intake of added sugars. Information about added sugar content is not provided on packaged foods in Brazil, and even total sugar content information is often absent. This study aimed to (i) adapt a systematic methodology for estimating added sugar content in packaged foods when information on total and added sugar contents is not mandatory on labels, (ii) apply the adapted methodology to a Brazilian food composition database to estimate the extent of added sugar content in the national food supply, and (iii) assess the validity of the adapted methodology. We developed an 8-step protocol to estimate added sugar content using information provided on food labels. These steps included objective and subjective estimation procedures. Mean, median, and quartiles of the added sugar content of 4,805 Brazilian foods were determined and presented by food categories. Validity was assessed using a US database containing values of added sugar as displayed on the product labels. Objective estimation of added sugar content could be conducted for 3,119 products (64.9%), with the remainder 1,686 (35.1%) being assessed using subjective estimation. We found that 3,093 (64.4%) foods contained added sugar ingredients and the overall estimated median added sugar content was 4.7 g (interquartile range 0 â€“ 29.3) per 100 g or 100 ml. The validity testing on US data for products with known added sugar values showed excellent agreement between estimated and reported added sugar values (ICC = 0.98). This new methodology is a useful approach for estimating the added sugar content of products in countries where both added and total sugar information are not mandated on food labels. The method can be used to monitor added sugar levels and support interventions aimed at limiting added sugar intake","authors":["Tailane Scapin","Jimmy Chun Yu Louie","Simone Pettigrew","Bruce
