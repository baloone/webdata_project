{"id":"355972400_Comparing_the_Scholarly_Output_of_Mexico_in_Different_Fields_Medicine_Neuroscience_and_Computer_Science","abstract":"Computer science, medicine and neuroscience are areas of knowledge in which research has increased significantly in recent years worldwide, in addition to the fact that these areas have had great technological advances. The objective of this research is to make a comparison of the performance in academic production among these areas of knowledge. The collection of data related to the academic production of each area was done through Scival, a tool that takes data from the Scopus database to evaluate research performance. The results indicate all the three fields had an increase between the years 2016 and 2020, the latter being the year in which all of them reached a peak in academic production. However, from 2020 onwards there is a decline in computer science and medicine, while neuroscience continues to increase.","authors":["Rafael Martínez García Peña","Sharon Ramírez"],"meta":["November 2021"],"references":["346870554_Comparative_analysis_on_the_indicators_from_Latin_American_countries_with_more_scientific_paper_publications_in_the_SIR_Iber_2020","342621670_The_keyword_to_success_Comparative_analysis_of_Computer_Science_research_across_representative_universities_in_Latin_America","337202172_Scientific_Productivity_in_Neurosciences_in_Latin_America_A_Scientometrics_Perspective","310461138_Multiparametric_characterization_of_scientometric_performance_profiles_assisted_by_neural_networks_a_study_of_Mexican_higher_education_institutions","283202475_Scientometric_mapping_of_computer_science_research_in_Mexico"]}
