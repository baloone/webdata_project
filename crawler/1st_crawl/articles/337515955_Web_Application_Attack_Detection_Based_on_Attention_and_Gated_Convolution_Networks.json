{"id":"337515955_Web_Application_Attack_Detection_Based_on_Attention_and_Gated_Convolution_Networks","abstract":"This paper proposes an anomaly detection model based on the reconstruction error to detect malicious requests in a Web application. Our model combines a multi-head attention network and gated convolution network to capture the pattern of a normal request. Moreover, we use a novel segmentation method to enhance the structural representation of a request and embed a raw request into a feature matrix. The result of this experiment indicates that our model has good ability to distinguish between normal and abnormal requests.","authors":["Jiancong Li","Yusheng Fu","Jie Xu","Chunhui Ren"],"meta":["November 2019IEEE Access PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2955674"],"references":["328760180_Detecting_Attacks_on_Web_Applications_using_Autoencoder","311900760_Language_Modeling_with_Gated_Convolutional_Networks","304758073_LSTM-based_Encoder-Decoder_for_Multi-sensor_Anomaly_Detection","301839500_TensorFlow_Large-Scale_Machine_Learning_on_Heterogeneous_Distributed_Systems","234131319_Efficient_Estimation_of_Word_Representations_in_Vector_Space","224384174_Isolation_Forest","221346269_Extracting_and_composing_robust_features_with_denoising_autoencoders","220320676_Stacked_Denoising_Autoencoders_Learning_Useful_Representations_in_a_Deep_Network_with_a_Local_Denoising_Criterion","4147561_Anomaly_intrusion_detection_using_one_class_SVM","323820752_Anomaly-Based_Web_Attack_Detection_A_Deep_Learning_Approach","323118482_URLNet_Learning_a_URL_Representation_with_Deep_Learning_for_Malicious_URL_Detection","317558625_Attention_Is_All_You_Need","317417717_How_to_Generate_a_Good_Word_Embedding","305719793_Anomaly_Detection","289710042_What's_in_a_URL_Genre_classification_from_URLs","283531914_Semi-supervised_Sequence_Learning","269935079_Adam_A_Method_for_Stochastic_Optimization","265554383_Sequence_to_Sequence_Learning_with_Neural_Networks","257489167_Intrusion_detection_system_A_comprehensive_review","250702048_Web_application_attacks","221653642_Beyond_blacklists_learning_to_detect_malicious_Web_sites_from_suspicious_URLs","221609278_Anomaly_detection_of_web-based_attacks","6912170_Reducing_the_Dimensionality_of_Data_with_Neural_Networks","2816554_Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol_--_HTTP11"]}
