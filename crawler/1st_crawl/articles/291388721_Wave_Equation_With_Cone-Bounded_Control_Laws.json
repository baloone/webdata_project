{"id":"291388721_Wave_Equation_With_Cone-Bounded_Control_Laws","abstract":"This paper deals with a wave equation with a one-dimensional space variable, which describes the dynamics of string deflection. Two kinds of control are considered: a distributed action and a boundary control. It is supposed that the control signal is subject to a cone-bounded nonlinearity. This kind of feedback laws includes (but is not restricted to) saturating inputs. By closing the loop with such a nonlinear control, it is thus obtained a nonlinear partial differential equation, which is the generalization of the classical 1D wave equation. The well-posedness is proven by using nonlinear semigroups techniques. Considering a sector condition to tackle the control nonlinearity and assuming that a tuning parameter has a suitable sign, the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system is proven by Lyapunov techniques. Some numerical simulations illustrate the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop nonlinear partial differential equations.","authors":["Christophe Prieur","Sophie Tarbouriech","Joao Manoel Gomes da Silva"],"meta":["November 2016IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control 61(11):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TAC.2016.2519759"],"references":["257432153_ISS-Lyapunov_functions_for_time-varying_hyperbolic_systems_of_balance_laws","245217985_Strong_stability_of_elastic_control_systems_with_dissipative_saturating_feedback","228574727_Control_of_a_clamped-free_beam_by_a_piezoelectric_actuator","222660213_Stabilization_of_a_1-D_tank_containing_a_fluid_modeled_by_the_shallow_water_equations","3032609_A_Strict_Lyapunov_Function_for_Boundary_Control_of_Hyperbolic_Systems_of_Conservation_Laws","3032579_Stability_and_Performance_for_Saturated_Systems_via_Quadratic_and_Nonquadratic_Lyapunov_Functions","3032505_Stability_Analysis_and_Stabilization_of_Systems_Presenting_Nested_Saturations","316799413_Stability_and_Stabilization_of_Linear_Systems_with_Saturating_Actuators","316588466_Numerical_Methods_Using_MATLABR","286576247_Modern_Anti-Windup_Synthesis_Control_Augmentation_for_Actuator_Saturation","282320563_Well-posedness_and_stability_of_a_1D_wave_equation_with_saturating_distributed_input","268606529_Nonlinear_semigroups_and_differential_equations_in_Banach_spaces_Revised_and_enlarged_translation_of_the_Romanian_ed","267472877_Vibrations_and_waves","267184172_Ordinary_and_Partial_Differential_Equations_With_Special_Functions_Fourier_Series_and_Boundary_Value_Problems","265668832_Introductory_Functional_Analysis_With_Application","261181953_Semi-definite_programming_and_functional_inequalities_for_Distributed_Parameter_Systems","248390625_Nonlinear_Semigroups","243022326_Asymptotic_behavior_of_nonlinear_contraction_semigroups","239020668_An_Introduction_to_Infinite-Dimensional_Linear_Systems_Theory","237005644_Introductory_Functional_Analysis_with_Applications","226153184_Feedback_stabilization_of_a_hybrid_PDE-ODE_system","225551742_Feedback_stabilization_of_a_linear_control_system_in_Hilbert_space_with_a_priori_bounded_control","222573949_Control_design_for_a_class_of_nonlinear_continuous-time_systems","222163119_Robust_Control_of_Processes_Subject_to_Saturation_Nonlinearities","220159327_Exponential_stabilization_of_an_overhead_crane_with_flexible_cable_via_a_back-stepping_approach","44376017_Semigroups_of_Linear_Operators_and_Applications_to_Partial_Differential_Equations"]}
