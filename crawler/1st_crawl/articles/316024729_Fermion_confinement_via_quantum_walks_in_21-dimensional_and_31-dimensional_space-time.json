{"id":"316024729_Fermion_confinement_via_quantum_walks_in_21-dimensional_and_31-dimensional_space-time","abstract":"We analyze the properties of a two- and three-dimensional quantum walk that are inspired by the idea of a brane-world model put forward by Rubakov and Shaposhnikov [Phys. Lett. B 125, 136 (1983)]. In that model, particles are dynamically confined on the brane due to the interaction with a scalar field. We translated this model into an alternate quantum walk with a coin that depends on the external field, with a dependence which mimics a domain wall solution. As in the original model, fermions (in our case, the walker) become localized in one of the dimensions, not from the action of a random noise on the lattice (as in the case of Anderson localization) but from a regular dependence in space. On the other hand, the resulting quantum walk can move freely along the “ordinary” dimensions.","authors":["Iván Márquez Martín","Giuseppe Di Molfetta","A.
