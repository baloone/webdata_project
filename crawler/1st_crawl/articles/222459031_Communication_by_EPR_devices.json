{"id":"222459031_Communication_by_EPR_devices","abstract":"A recent proposal to achieve faster-than-light communication by means of an EPR-type experimental set-up is examined. We demonstrate that such superluminal communication is not possible. The crucial role of the linearity of the quantum mechanical evolution laws in preventing causal anomalies is stressed.","authors":["Dennis Dieks"],"meta":["November 1982Physics Letters A 92(6):271-272","DOI:10.1016/0375-9601(82)90084-6","SourceOAI"],"references":["227197032_Bell's_theorem_and_the_different_concepts_of_locality","227105657_FLASH-A_superluminal_communicator_based_upon_a_new_kind_of_quantum_measurement","226835153_A_general_argument_against_superluminal_transmission_through_the_quantum_mechanical_measurement_process"]}
