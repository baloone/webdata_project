{"id":"316461402_Calculation_and_analysis_of_assembly_clearance_based_on_non-ideal_surface_discrete_data","abstract":"Calculation of assembly clearance is the basis of analysis on assembly problems, and the real assembly surface is the nonideal surface. In this paper, the concept of assembly clearance on nonideal surface is defined and the calculation algorithm of assembly clearance is designed. Based on the calculation, the concept of clearance surface is put forward to express the distribution of assembly clearance on nonideal surface as it can assist the analysis of assembly problems. Finally, the effectiveness of the algorithm is verified by the calculation of the assembly clearance between the surfaces of piston and cylinder.","authors":["Yue Li","Lihong Qiao","Uzair Khaleeq Uz Zaman","A.
