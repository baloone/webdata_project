{"id":"310820953_Coinduction_All_the_Way_Up","abstract":"We revisit coinductive proof principles from a lattice theoretic point of view. By associating to any monotone function a function which we call the companion, we give a new presentation of both Knaster-Tarski's seminal result, and of the more recent theory of enhancements of the coinductive proof method (up-to techniques).\nThe resulting theory encompasses parameterized coinduction, as recently proposed by Hur et al., and second-order reasoning, i.e., the ability to reason coinductively about the enhancements themselves. It moreover resolves a historical peculiarity about up-to context techniques.\nBased on these results, we present an open-ended proof system allowing one to perform proofs on-the-fly and to neatly separate inductive and coinductive phases.","authors":["Damien Pous"],"meta":["July 2016","DOI:10.1145/2933575.2934564","Conference: the 31st Annual ACM/IEEE Symposium"],"references":["281886445_A_Lightweight_Formalization_of_the_Metatheory_of_Bisimulation-Up-To","261859777_CompCertTSO_A_Verified_Compiler_for_Relaxed-Memory_Concurrency","221221785_An_Asynchronous_Distributed_Implementation_of_Mobile_Ambients","220997280_Small_bisimulations_for_reasoning_about_higher-order_imperative_programs","220431714_Bisimulation_Can't_Be_Traced","37794752_Formal_Verification_of_a_Realistic_Compiler","3811856_Towards_a_theory_of_bisimulation_for_local_names","2492932_The_Lazy_Lambda_Calculus","2378417_Generalised_Coinduction","346062262_A_calculus_of_mobile_processes_I","313348452_A_theory_of_bisimulation_for_a_fragment_of_concurrent_ML_with_local_names","312589793_Techniques_modulo_pour_les_bisimulations","311490305_Bisimulation_up-to_techniques_for_psi-calculi","303968960_A_Bisimulation_for_Type_Abstraction_and_Recursion","303217994_The_Largest_Respectful_Function","268163977_Bisimulations_Up-to_Beyond_First-Order_Transition_Systems","266987978_Combining_Bialgebraic_Semantics_and_Equations","266425464_The_p-Calculus_A_Theory_of_Mobile_Processes","262493916_Un_theoreme_sur_les_fonctions_d'ensembles","262273915_Complete_Lattices_and_Up-To_Techniques","262257779_The_Power_of_Parameterization_in_Coinductive_Proof","259914753_Coinduction_up_to_in_a_fibrational_setting","259362495_A_coinductive_calculus_of_streams","259360338_Generalised_Coinduction","242415832_An_algorithm_for_testing_the_equivalence_of_finite_automata","240813346_Relational_Reasoning_about_Functions_and_Nondeterminism","240444412_A_distributed_implementation_of_Ambients","235208212_An_N_Log_N_Algorithm_for_Minimizing_States_in_a_Finite_Automaton","224001269_Communication_and_Concurrency","223630020_A_bisimulation_for_dynamic_sealing","221602452_A_Bisimulation_Method_for_Cryptographic_Protocols","220690132_The_Pi-Calculus_-_a_theory_of_mobile_processes","220673109_A_Bisimulation_Method_for_Cryptographic_Protocols","220248383_A_Calculus_of_Mobile_Processes_I","38347971_A_Lattice-Theoretical_Fixpoint_Theorem_and_Its_Applications","3763294_Bisimulation_in_name-passing_calculi_without_matching","3707359_Towards_a_mathematical_operational_semantics","2816767_On_the_Bisimulation_Proof_Method","2493112_Relational_Reasoning_about_Contexts","2321157_Theory_of_bisimulation_for_a_fragment_of_concurrent_ML_with_local_names"]}
