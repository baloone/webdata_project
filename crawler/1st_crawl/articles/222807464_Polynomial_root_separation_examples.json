{"id":"222807464_Polynomial_root_separation_examples","abstract":"G. E. Collins [J. Symb. Comput. 32, No. 5, 467–473 (2001; Zbl 1008.12001)] reported on extensive calculations supporting his conjecture that the exponent 1-n in the well-known Mahler-Mignotte bound for the root separation of squarefree integral polynomials of degree n might be replaceable with -n/2. This paper exhibits infinite sequences of cubic polynomials with ‘true’ exponent -2, thus disproving that conjecture for degree n=3, and extends this to analogous bounds for close root triplets of quartic polynomials.","authors":["Arnold Schönhage"],"meta":["October 2006Journal of Symbolic Computation 41(10):1080-1090","DOI:10.1016/j.jsc.2006.06.003","SourceDBLP"],"references":["2114432_Distances_between_the_conjugates_of_an_algebraic_number","265834048_Distance_entre_les_racines_d'un_polynome","265349424_Some_Useful_Bounds","264945958_Modern_Computer_Algebra","231853640_On_the_distance_between_roots_of_integer_polynomials","223114069_Polynomial_Minimum_Root_Separation","220694849_Mathematics_for_Computer_Algebra","220538069_On_the_Distance_Between_the_Roots_of_a_Polynomial","38322985_An_inequality_for_the_discriminant_of_a_polynomial"]}
