{"id":"329107867_Relating_an_Adaptive_Network's_Structure_to_Its_Emerging_Behaviour_for_Hebbian_Learning","abstract":"In this paper it is analysed how emerging behaviour of an adaptive network can be related to characteristics of the adaptive networkâ€™s structure (which includes the adaptation structure). In particular, this is addressed for mental networks based on Hebbian learning. To this end relevant properties of the network and the adaptation that have been identified are discussed. As a result it has been found that in an achieved equilibrium state the value of a connection weight has a functional relation to the values of the connected states.","authors":["Jan Treur"],"meta":["December 2018","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-04070-3_28","Conference: 7th International Conference on Theory and Practice of Natural Computing, TPNC'18","Project: Mathematical Analysis of Emergent Network Behaviour in Relation to the Network's Structure"],"references":["316356444_The_temporal_paradox_of_Hebbian_learning_and_homeostatic_plasticity","305930006_Network-Oriented_Modeling_Addressing_Complexity_of_Cognitive_Affective_and_Social_Interactions","270913254_Biological_context_of_Hebb_learning_in_artificial_neural_networks_a_review","261956809_Hebbian_learning_and_predictive_mirror_neurons_for_actions_sensations_and_emotions","258229910_The_dynamical_systems_approach_to_differential_equations","12050869_Synaptic_Modification_by_Correlated_Activity_Hebb's_Postulate_Revisited","286360296_Elements_of_Physical_Biology-Williams_and_Wilkins_Reprinted_1956_as_Elements_of_Mathematical_Biology_by_Dover_Pulblications","269760167_The_Organization_of_Behavior_A_Neuropsychological_Theory","264954859_The_Qualitative_Theory_of_Ordinary_Differential_Equations","246047720_The_Elements_of_Physical_Biology","228118040_The_Organization_of_Behavior_A_Neuropsychological_Theory","11008566_Mathematical_Formulations_of_Hebbian_Learning","8224945_Demystifying_social_cognition_A_Hebbian_perspective"]}
