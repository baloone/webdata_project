{"id":"337269996_Designing_for_Awareness_in_Interactions_with_Shared_Systems_The_DASS_Framework","abstract":"Most systems that we use in everyday life are sharedâ€”because multiple people can interact or because an interaction by one person can affect other people. However, everyday Internet of Things systems are often designed for individual use. Prior research on collaboration technologies (Computer Supported Collaborative Work) has shown that to coordinate system sharing people require awareness of the social context, which interfaces can support by making salient information visible. Although literature exists on how to design for awareness, this can be fragmented and difficult to relate to other application domains. To introduce a broader audience of interaction designers to awareness, we aim to make the available design knowledge more generalizable and operational. With this aim, we construct the Designing for Awareness in Shared Systems framework that gives a structured and comprehensive overview of design considerations for awareness. The framework can stimulate reflection and inform decision-making when designing interactions with shared systems.","authors":["Karin Niemantsverdriet","Harm Van Essen","Minna Pakanen","Berry Eggen"],"meta":["November 2019ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction 26(6):1-41","DOI:10.1145/3338845"],"references":["324661078_Share_and_Share_Alike_Social_Information_and_Interaction_Style_in_Coordination_of_Shared_Use","320073542_Pedestrian_Interaction_with_Vehicles_Roles_of_Explicit_and_Implicit_Communication","316825907_Evaluating_Interface_Characteristics_for_Shared_Lighting_Systems_in_the_Office_Environment","312077649_A_perspective_on_multi-user_interaction_design_based_on_an_understanding_of_domestic_lighting_conflicts","303901921_Designing_for_Multi-User_Interaction_in_the_Home_Environment_Implementing_Social_Translucence","297722539_The_Consumer_Science_of_Sharing_A_Discussant's_Observations","295399531_Implications_of_We-Awareness_to_the_Design_of_Distributed_Groupware_Tools","283102665_Intelligent_Computing_in_Personal_Informatics_Key_Design_Considerations","273914177_Blended_Spaces_for_Collaboration","271658599_The_internet_of_things_A_survey","268372078_A_Survey_of_Empirical_Studies_of_Conflict","262257884_Distance_Matters","258138570_Situation_Awareness_Is_Adaptive_Externally_Directed_Consciousness","255566130_KidzFrame_Supporting_Awareness_in_the_Daycare","243765020_Toward_Atheory_of_Automated_Group_Work","239761755_Mechanisms_for_Collaboration_A_Design_and_Evaluation_Framework_for_Multi-User_Interfaces","238726326_A_General_Framework_for_Cooperative_Manipulation_in_Virtual_Environments","237119354_Locating_Family_Values_A_Field_Trial_of_the_Whereabouts_Clock_Nominated_for_the_Best_Paper_Award","236627583_Context_Aware_Computing_for_The_Internet_of_Things_A_Survey","234815601_Social_navigation_Techniques_for_building_more_usable_systems","234792774_WYSIWIS_revised_early_experiences_with_multiuser_interfaces","329727942_Toward_a_Theory_of_Situation_Awareness_in_Dynamic_Systems","323766312_ClassBeacons_Designing_Distributed_Visualization_of_Teachers'_Physical_Proximity_in_the_Classroom","314720359_Designing_visualizations_of_social_activity_six_claims","312451616_The_currently_unique_value_of_collocated_work","309709755_Commentary_Interactivity_-_Agency_Pace_and_Attention","308165523_The_interaction-attention_continuum_Considering_various_levels_of_human_attention_in_interaction_design","303901810_Designing_Multi-user_Lighting_Interfaces_Four_strategies_to_implement_Social_Translucence","303559654_Satisfying_light_conditions_A_field_study_on_perception_of_consensus_light_in_Dutch_open_office_environments","301935257_Things_We_Own_Together_Sharing_Possessions_at_Home","300917981_Mood_Squeezer","289575370_Designing_to_Support_Social_Connectedness_The_Case_of_SnowGlobe","282271512_Tangible_Lights_In-Air_Gestural_Control_of_Home_Lighting","277427385_Case_study","273490729_Sharing_Domestic_Life_through_Long-Term_Video_Connections","269031577_Multilevel_design_and_role_play","266655473_Making_big_gestures_Effects_of_gesture_size_on_observability_and_identification_for_co-located_group_awareness","262402642_Reality_editor_programming_smarter_objects","262007902_Awareness_Systems_Advances_in_Theory_Methodology_and_Design","261845730_Crossing_the_Bridge_over_Norman's_Gulf_of_Execution_Revealing_Feedforward's_True_Identity","260135123_What_really_is_going_on_Review_of_situation_awareness_models_for_individuals_and_teams","259703201_Grounding_in_Communication","257552358_Supporting_Effortless_Coordination_25_Years_of_Awareness_Research","245385506_A_field_study_of_occupant_controlled_lighting_in_offices","244486422_Human-computer_interaction","243680233_Extending_Awareness_Beyond_Synchronous_Collaboration","242627042_The_Coming_Age_of_Calm_Technology","239548511_Situation_Awareness_and_the_Cognitive_Management_of_Complex_Systems","239462486_Cognition_and_Reality_Principles_and_Implications_of_Cognitive_Psychology","239032377_Collective_Intentions_and_Actions","228801660_Edit_wear_and_read_wear","228754186_The_impact_of_increased_awareness_while_face-to-face","227033139_Locating_Family_Values_A_Field_Trial_of_the_Whereabouts_Clock","228095891_Internet_of_Things_IoT_A_Vision_Architectural_Elements_and_FutureDirections","227981521_Conflict_and_Conflict_Management_Reflections_and_Update"]}
