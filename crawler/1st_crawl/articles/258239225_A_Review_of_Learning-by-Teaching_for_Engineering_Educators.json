{"id":"258239225_A_Review_of_Learning-by-Teaching_for_Engineering_Educators","abstract":"Learning-by-teaching is a pedagogical approach grossly underused in the education of engineers at all levels. The existing learning-by-teaching literature across all disciplines was reviewed with the intent of formally presenting this teaching method to engineering educators. The review defines learning-by-teaching, presents theoretical support for use, details the teaching process, and reports seminal work in a variety of contexts investigating the impacts on learning. The overall review is then discussed in terms of possible implications for engineering education.","authors":["Adam Carberry","Matthew W Ohland"],"meta":["January 2012Advances in Engineering Education 3(2)"],"references":["245493804_The_Nature_and_Development_of_Engineering_Expertise","234671448_Factors_Affecting_the_Tutoring_Process","233232568_The_Pimlico_Connection_Undergraduates_as_tutors_in_schools","222728932_Learning_for_later_teaching_An_exploration_of_mediational_links_between_teaching_expectancy_and_learning_results","248962984_Peer_Tutoring_in_Higher_Education","233085619_Peer_tutoring_in_engineering_design_A_case_study","232486148_Manipulating_Cooperative_Scripts_for_Teaching_and_Learning","232458873_Oral_summary_as_a_review_strategy_for_enhancing_recall_of_textual_material","229275140_The_benefits_of_tutoring_An_exploration_of_expectancy_and_outcomes","228667012_Toward_Teachers'_Adaptive_Metacognition","227632779_Collaborative_Dialogue_Patterns_in_Naturalistic_One-to-One_Tutoring","226817678_Student_Peer_Teaching_An_Innovative_Approach_to_Instruction_in_Science_and_Engineering_Education","226137615_A_Cognitive_Model_for_Examining_Teachers'_Instructional_Practice_in_Mathematics_A_Guide_for_Facilitating_Teacher_Reflection","226100017_Facilitating_small-group_learning_A_comparison_of_student_and_staff_tutors'_behavior"]}
