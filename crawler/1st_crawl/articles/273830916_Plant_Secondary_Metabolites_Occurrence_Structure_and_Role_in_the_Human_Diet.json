{"id":"273830916_Plant_Secondary_Metabolites_Occurrence_Structure_and_Role_in_the_Human_Diet","abstract":"Plant secondary metabolites have been a fertile area of chemical investigation for many years, driving the development of both analytical chemistry and of new synthetic reactions and methodologies. The subject is multi-disciplinary with chemists, biochemists and plant scientists all contributing to our current understanding. In recent years there has been an upsurge in interest from other disciplines, related to the realisation that secondary metabolites are dietary components that may have a considerable impact on human health, and to the development of gene technology that permits modulation of the contents of desirable and undesirable components.","authors":["Alan Crozier","Michael N Clifford","Hiroshi Ashihara"],"meta":["October 2006","DOI:10.1002/9780470988558","Publisher: BlackwellISBN: 978-1-4051-2509-3"],"references":["247821663_Preparation_of_Epimers_of_Tea_Catechins_by_Heat_Treatment","253245137_Production_of_the_Isoflavones_Genistein_and_Daidzein_in_NonLegume_Dicot_and_Monocot_Tissues","232328486_Isolation_of_a_novel_NADPH-dependent_reductase_which_coacts_with_chalcone_synthase_in_the_biosynthesis_of_6'-deoxychalcone","231554905_Quantitative_Analysis_of_the_Flavonoid_Content_of_Commercial_Tomatoes_Onions_Lettuce_and_Celery","229726897_The_flavonoid_biosynthetic_pathway_in_plants_Function_and_evolution","227847335_Scavenging_effect_of_tea_catechins_and_their_epimers_on_superoxide_anion_radicals_generated_by_hypoxanthine_and_xanthine_oxidase","223687066_Immunolocalization_of_vestitone_reductase_and_isoflavone_reductase_two_enzymes_involved_in_the_biosynthesis_of_the_phytoalexin_medicarpin","40185839_Content_of_potentially_anticarcinogenic_flavonoids_of_tea_infusions_wines_and_fruit_juices","40131264_Content_of_potentially_anticarcinogenic_flavonoids_of_28_vegetables_and_9_fruits_commonly_consumed_in_The_Netherlands","19240363_Effects_of_stilbene_on_arachidonate_metabolism_in_leukocytes","14090029_Resveratrol_A_molecule_whose_time_has_come_And_gone","13783937_Chemistry_of_tea_flavonoids","13604109_Analysis_of_bHLH_and_MYB_domain_proteins_Species-specific_regulatory_differences_are_caused_by_divergent_evolution_of_target_anthocyanin_genes","12390429_Determination_of_Catechins_in_Human_Urine_Subsequent_to_Tea_Ingestion_by_High-Performance_Liquid_Chromatography_with_Electrochemical_Detection","12047055_Metabolic_engineering_and_applications_of_flavonoids"]}
