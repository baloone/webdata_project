{"id":"330144278_Turbomachinery_Noise_Predictions_Present_and_Future","abstract":"In future Ultra-High ByPass Ratio turboengines, the turbomachinery noise (fan and turbine stages mainly) is expected to increase significantly. A review of analytical models and numerical methods to yield both tonal and broadband contributions of such noise sources is presented. The former rely on hybrid methods coupling gust response over very thin flat plates of finite chord length, either isolated or in cascade, and acoustic analogies in free-field and in a duct. The latter yields tonal noise with unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (u-RANS) simulations, and broadband noise with Large Eddy Simulations (LES). The analytical models are shown to provide good and fast first sound estimates at pre-design stages, and to easily separate the different noise sources. The u-RANS simulations are now able to give accurate estimates of tonal noise of the most complex asymmetric, heterogeneous fan-Outlet Guiding Vane (OGV) configurations. Wall-modeled LES on rescaled stage configurations have now been achieved on all components: a low-pressure compressor stage, a transonic high-pressure turbine stage and a fan-OGV configuration with good overall sound power level predictions for the latter. In this case, hybrid Lattice-Boltzmann/very large-eddy simulations also appear to be an excellent alternative to yield both contributions accurately at once.","authors":["Stéphane Moreau"],"meta":["January 2019Acoustics 1(1):92–116","DOI:10.3390/acoustics1010008","Project: Aeroacoustics of propulsion and ventilation systems"],"references":["327388299_Turbomachinery-related_aeroacoustic_modelling_and_simulation","322305613_Large_Eddy_Simulation_of_a_Scale-model_Turbofan_for_Fan_Noise_Source_Diagnostic","327735526_A_characteristic_inlet_boundary_condition_for_compressible_turbulent_multispecies_turbomachinery_flows","327323301_Study_of_Combustion_Noise_Generation_in_a_Realistic_Turbine_Stage_Configuration","326674130_Advanced_noise_modeling_for_future_propulsion_systems","325962768_An_Analytic_Solution_for_Gust-Cascade_Interaction_Noise_Including_Effects_of_Realistic_Aerofoil_Geometry_Inter-Blade_Region","325962356_Fan_Tonal_and_Broadband_Noise_Simulations_at_Transonic_Operating_Conditions_Using_Lattice-Boltzmann_Methods","324865689_Fast_and_accurate_analytical_modeling_of_broadband_noise_for_a_low-speed_fan","323425128_Numerical_Analysis_of_a_High-Order_Unstructured_Overset_Grid_Method_for_Compressible_LES_of_Turbomachinery","320024357_Turbofan_Broadband_Noise_Prediction_Using_the_Lattice_Boltzmann_Method"]}
