{"id":"279633406_A_comparative_study_of_divisive_hierarchical_clustering_algorithms","abstract":"A general scheme for divisive hierarchical clustering algorithms is proposed.\nIt is made of three main steps : first a splitting procedure for the\nsubdivision of clusters into two subclusters, second a local evaluation of the\nbipartitions resulting from the tentative splits and, third, a formula for\ndetermining the nodes levels of the resulting dendrogram. A handfull of such\nalgorithms is given. These algorithms are compared using the Goodman-Kruskal\ncorrelation coefficient. As a global criterion it is an internal\ngoodness-of-fit measure based on the set order induced by the hierarchy\ncompared to the order associated to the given dissimilarities. Applied to a\nhundred of random data tables, these comparisons are in favor of two methods\nbased on non-usual ratio-type formulas for the splitting procedures, namely the\nSilhouette criterion and the Dunn's criterion. These two criteria take into\naccount both the within cluster and the between cluster mean dissimilarity. In\ngeneral the results of these two algorithms are better than the classical\nAgglomerative Average Link method.","authors":["Maurice Roux"],"meta":["June 2015Journal of Classification 35(4)","DOI:10.1007/s00357-018-9259-9","SourcearXiv"],"references":["232128980_Sokal_RR_Rohlf_FJ_The_comparison_of_dendrograms_by_objective_methods_Taxon_11_33-40","222451107_Rousseeuw_PJ_Silhouettes_A_Graphical_Aid_to_the_Interpretation_and_Validation_of_Cluster_Analysis_Comput_Appl_Math_20_53-65","51889711_Methods_of_Hierarchical_Clustering","7826340_BIOINFORMATICS_Computational_cluster_validation_in_post-genomic_data_analysis","2628533_A_Comparison_of_Document_Clustering_Techniques","313145413_Hierarchical_grouping_to_optimize_an_obiective_function","312986441_The_Comparison_of_Dendrograms_by_Objective_Methods","288955131_Basic_Procedures_in_Hierarchical_Cluster_Analysis","285982622_Measures_of_Association_for_Cross_Classifications","285890685_Une_methode_de_classification_descendante_hierarchique_Application_a_l'analyse_lexicale_par_contexte","277665024_Ward's_Hierarchical_Agglomerative_Clustering_Method_Which_Algorithms_Implement_Ward's_Criterion","272176868_Finding_Groups_in_Data_An_Introduction_to_Cluster_Analysis","271814846_Multivariate_Methods_in_Plant_Ecology_I_Association-Analysis_in_Plant_Communities","256821857_A_Method_for_Cluster_Analysis","246863174_Molecular_Classification_of_Cancer_Cla_ss_Discovery_and_Class_Prediction_by_Gene_Expression","243778630_Dissimilarity_Analysis_A_new_Technique_of_Hierarchical_Sub-division","242512892_A_New_Measure_of_Rank_Correlation","233292309_Well-Separated_Clusters_and_Optimal_Fuzzy_Partitions","229509472_The_analysis_of_Romano-British_pottery_by_atomic_absorption_spectrophotometry","227098544_Principal_Direction_Divisive_Partitioning","224434544_Some_Distance_Properties_of_Latent_Root_and_Vector_Methods_Used_in_Multivariate_Analysis","220457938_Evaluation_of_hierarchical_grouping_techniques_A_preliminary_study","216301644_Hierarchical_Grouping_to_Optimize_an_Objective_Function","216300608_The_Use_of_Multiple_Measurements_in_Taxonomic_Problems","24062042_Monotone_invariant_clustering_procedure","24056084_Hierarchical_Clustering_via_Joint_Between-Within_Distances_Extending_Ward's_Minimum_Variance_Method","2492074_A_Relative_Approach_To_Hierarchical_Clustering"]}
