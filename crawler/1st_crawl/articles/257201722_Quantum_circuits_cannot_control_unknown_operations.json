{"id":"257201722_Quantum_circuits_cannot_control_unknown_operations","abstract":"One of the essential building blocks of classical computer programs is the\n\"if\" clause, which executes a subroutine depending on the value of a control\nvariable. Similarly, several quantum algorithms rely on the possibility of\napplying a quantum operation conditioned on the state of a control system. Here\nwe show that such a control cannot be performed within a quantum circuit if the\noperation itself is not known in advance. However, when physical operations act\non a subspace of an extended Hilbert space, the control becomes possible. This\ndemonstrates that the quantum circuit model must be generalized to account for\ncomputational problems in which operations themselves are variables.","authors":["Mateus Araújo","Adrien Feix","Fabio Costa","Časlav Brukner"],"meta":["September 2013New Journal of Physics 16(9)","DOI:10.1088/1367-2630/16/9/093026","SourcearXiv"],"references":["260003400_Decrease_in_query_complexity_for_quantum_computers_with_superposition_of_circuits","257592631_Quantum_Computing_with_black-box_Subroutines","231863704_Quantum_correlations_with_no_causal_order","51946587_Calculating_Unknown_Eigenvalues_with_a_Quantum_Algorithm","51939985_Perfect_discrimination_of_no-signalling_channels_via_quantumsuperposition_of_causal_structures","262372029_Quantum_algorithm_for_measuring_the_eigenvalues_of_U_U_-1_for_a_black-box_unitary_transformation_U","257982627_Quantum_computations_without_definite_causal_structure","232724806_Quantum_computation_with_programmable_connections_between_gates","228109669_A_Single_Quantum_Cannot_be_Cloned","220138846_Quantum_measurements_and_the_Abelian_Stabilizer_Problem","51542224_Adding_control_to_arbitrary_unknown_quantum_operations","45887526_Beyond_causally_ordered_Quantum_Computers","43512561_Simplifying_quantum_logic_using_higher-dimensional_Hilbert_spaces","24374761_Theoretical_framework_for_quantum_networks","50267715_Quantum_Metropolis_Sampling"]}
