Clinicians analyze fundus images manually in order to estimate it, but there is many drawbacks as it is a tedious, time-consuming and subjective work. Thus, automatic image processing methods become a necessity, as they make possible the efficient computation of objective parameters. In this paper we will discuss Sirius (System for the Integration of Retinal Images Understanding Service), a web-based application that enables the storage and treatment of various types of diagnostic tests and, more specifically, its tortuosity calculation module. \nPMID: 25488211 [PubMed - in process]","authors":["Luisa SÃ¡nchez Brea","Noelia Barreira","Penedo MG","Gabriel Coll de Tuero"],"meta":["December 2014Studies in Health Technology and Informatics 2014;207:55-64.(207):55-64","DOI:10.3233/978-1-61499-474-9-55"],"references":["224247495_Automatic_retinal_vessel_tortuosity_measurement_using_curvature_of_improved_chain_code","221624284_Retinal_vessel_width_measurements_based_on_a_graph-theoretic_method","220080490_A_review_of_content-based_image_retrieval_systems_in_medical_applications_-_clinical_benefits_and_future_directions","51178016_Retinal_vascular_tortuosity_in_persons_with_diabetes_and_diabetic_retinopathy","291739455_Automated_thickness_measurement_of_retinal_blood_vessels_for_implementation_of_clinical_decision_support_systems_in_diagnostic_diabetic_retinopathy","260674968_Unified_methodology_for_evaluating_vessel_tree_tortuosity_metrics_in_eye_fundus_images","230732593_Five-Year_Incidence_of_Retinal_Microvascular_Abnormalities_and_Associations_with_Arterial_Hypertension_The_Beijing_Eye_Study_20012006","223775100_Multilocal_Creaseness_Based_on_the_Level-Set_Extrinsic_Curvature","222461072_ASSERT_A_physician-in-the-loop_content-based_retrieval_system_for_HRCT_image_databases","45798287_Sirius_A_web-based_system_for_retinal_image_analysis"]}
