{"id":"280082515_Higher_Education_Research_Expenditure_in_South_Africa_A_Review_of_the_New_Funding_Framework","abstract":"In this paper, we analyse the trends and the trajectory of higher education research expenditure in South Africa – since the introduction of the New Funding Formula (NFF) in 2004. The paper also compares the level of South Africa's total gross expenditure on research and development (GERD) with those of some selected economies. The findings of this study show that since the introduction of the New Funding Formula, there has been a significant increase in the higher education research expenditure in South Africa. The study also finds that although South Africa's total gross expenditure on research and development (GERD), as a percentage of GDP, is currently the highest in Africa, it is still lagging behind countries, such as China, Russia and Brazil. The study, therefore, recommends further investment in research and development in South Africa – in order to enable the country to achieve its vision of becoming a knowledge-based economy.","authors":["Nicholas M Odhiambo","Lydia Ntenga"],"meta":["August 2015Industry and Higher Education Volume 29(Issue 4)","DOI:10.5367/ihe.2015.0263"],"references":["241687209_Is_there_a_linear_relationship_between_RD_intensity_and_growth_Empirical_evidence_of_non-high-tech_vs_high-tech_SMEs","222434534_RD_spending_in_the_high-tech_sector_and_economic_growth","24104378_Innovating_Firms_and_Aggregate_Innovation","5137752_RD_and_Productivity_Testing_Sectoral_Peculiarities_Using_Micro_Data","5018422_Firm_Growth_and_RD_Expenditure","227868721_A_Longitudinal_Study_of_the_Impact_of_RD_Patents_and_Product_Innovation_on_Firm_Performance","227348751_RD_and_Productivity_A_Two_Way_Avenue","225338196_RD_and_economic_growth","24078515_On_the_relationship_between_innovation_and_performance_A_sensitivity_analysis","24047894_Issues_in_Assessing_the_Contribution_of_RD_to_Productivity_Growth"]}
