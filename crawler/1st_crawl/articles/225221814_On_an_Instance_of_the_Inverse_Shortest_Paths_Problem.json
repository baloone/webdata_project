{"id":"225221814_On_an_Instance_of_the_Inverse_Shortest_Paths_Problem","abstract":"The inverse shortest paths problem in a graph is considered, that is, the problem of recovering the arc costs given some information about the shortest paths in the graph. The problem is first motivated by some practical examples arising from applications. An algorithm based on the Golfarb-Idnani method for convex quadratic programming is then proposed and analyzed for one of the instances of the problem. Preliminary numerical results are reported. yBelgian National Fund for Scientific Research Department of Mathematics Facult'es Universitaires ND de la Paix B-5000 Namur, Belgium zDepartment of Mathematics Facult'es Universitaires ND de la Paix B-5000 Namur, Belgium Keywords : Graph theory, shortest paths, inverse problems, quadratic programming.
