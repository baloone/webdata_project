{"id":"269116261_Tensor_Network_Renormalization","abstract":"We introduce a coarse-graining transformation for tensor networks that can be\napplied to the study of both classical statistical and quantum many-body\nsystems, via contraction of the corresponding partition function or Euclidean\npath integral, respectively. The scheme is based upon the insertion of\noptimized unitary and isometric tensors into the tensor network and has, as its\nkey feature, the ability to completely remove short-range correlations at each\ncoarse-graining step. As a result, it produces a renormalization group flow (in\nthe space of tensors) that (i) has the correct structure of fixed points, and\n(ii) is computationally sustainable, even for systems at a critical point. We\ndemonstrate the proposed approach in the context of the 2D classical Ising\nmodel both near and at the critical point.","authors":["Glen Evenbly","Guifre Vidal"],"meta":["December 2014Physical Review Letters 115(18)","DOI:10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.180405","SourcearXiv"],"references":["275588278_Consistency_Conditions_for_an_AdSMERA_Correspondence","273471468_SurfaceState_Correspondence_as_a_Generalized_Holography","268436324_Entanglement_tensor_networks_and_black_hole_horizons","262108621_Phase_Transitions_of_Ferromagnetic_Potts_Models_on_the_Simple_Cubic_Lattice","236073099_Entanglement_Renormalization_for_Quantum_Fields_in_Real_Space","51978612_Coarse-graining_renormalization_by_higher-order_singular_value_decomposition","51969810_Renormalization_group_contraction_of_tensor_networks_in_three_dimensions","51939802_Coarse_graining_methods_for_spin_net_and_spin_foam_models","45899744_Renormalization_of_tensor-network_states","45888973_Boundary_quantum_critical_phenomena_with_entanglement_renormalization","38082230_Second_Renormalization_of_Tensor-Network_States","23316112_Accurate_Determination_of_Tensor_Network_State_of_Quantum_Lattice_Models_in_Two_Dimensions","323138850_Scaling_laws_for_ising_models_near_T_c","274012402_Holographic_quantum_error-correcting_codes_Toy_models_for_the_bulkboundary_correspondence","259044438_Algorithms_for_Entanglement_Renormalization_Boundaries_Impurities_and_Interfaces","258849346_Holographic_Geometry_of_cMERA_for_Quantum_Quenches_and_Finite_Temperature","235772139_Time_Evolution_of_Entanglement_Entropy_from_Black_Hole_Interiors","235598416_Tensor-entanglement_renormalization_group_approach_as_a_unified_method_for_symmetry_breaking_and_topological_phase_transitions","235410451_Renormalization_Group_-_Critical_Phenomena_And_Kondo_Problem","235410045_Conformal_Field_Theory","235221414_Real_Space_Renormalization_in_Statistical_Mechanics","232323196_Renormalization_group_methods","230609816_Tensor_Network_and_Black_Hole","200030821_White_SR_Density_matrix_formulation_for_quantum_renormalization_groups_Phys_Rev_Lett_69_2863-2866","51910203_Tensor_Network_States_and_Geometry","45862542_Matrix_Product_States_Projected_Entangled_Pair_States_and_variational_renormalization_group_methods_for_quantum_spin_systems","45850494_Entanglement_Renormalization_and_Holography","24148621_Tensor-Entanglement-Filtering_Renormalization_Approach_and_Symmetry_Protected_Topological_Order","23315808_Class_of_Quantum_Many-Body_States_That_Can_Be_Efficiently_Simulated","13282784_White_S_R_Density-matrix_algorithms_for_quantum_renormalization_groups_Phys_Rev_B_48_10345-10356","13256915_Conformal_Invariance_the_Central_Charge_and_Universal_Finite-Size_Amplitudes_at_Criticality","5915720_Tensor_Renormalization_Group_Approach_to_Two-Dimensional_Classical_Lattice_Models","5619226_Entanglement_Renormalization","2208944_Entanglement_renormalization_scale_invariance_and_quantum_criticality","2208210_Algorithms_for_entanglement_renormalization"]}
