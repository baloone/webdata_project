{"id":"255813817_Evolution_of_the_ATLAS_PanDA_Production_and_Distributed_Analysis_System","abstract":"The PanDA (Production and Distributed Analysis) system has been\ndeveloped to meet ATLAS production and analysis requirements for a\ndata-driven workload management system capable of operating at LHC data\nprocessing scale. PanDA has performed well with high reliability and\nrobustness during the two years of LHC data-taking, while being actively\nevolved to meet the rapidly changing requirements for analysis use\ncases. We will present an overview of system evolution including\nautomatic rebrokerage and reattempt for analysis jobs, adaptation for\nthe CernVM File System, support for the multi-cloud model through which\nTier-2 sites act as members of multiple clouds, pledged resource\nmanagement and preferential brokerage, and monitoring improvements. We\nwill also describe results from the analysis of two years of PanDA usage\nstatistics, current issues, and plans for the future.","authors":["Maeno T.","K.
