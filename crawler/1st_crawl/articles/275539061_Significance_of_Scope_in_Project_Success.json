{"id":"275539061_Significance_of_Scope_in_Project_Success","abstract":"Many projects start with good ideas, huge investments and great efforts. However, most of them do not achieve much success. A major contribution to unsuccessful projects is the lack of understanding or defining project and product scope at the start of the project. A properly defined and managed scope leads to delivering a quality product, in agreed cost and within specified schedules to the stake-holders. Whilst there is a clear understanding of the need to achieve project success, surprisingly little is published on significance of scope on project success. This study discusses that scope should be properly defined and controlled and what can be the major factors behind mismanagement of scope and how it can be overcome. It is concluded that a better appreciation of the distinction between project and product scope can bring a higher possibility of project success.","authors":["Muhammad Nabeel Mirza","Zohreh Pourzolfaghar","Mojde Shahnazari"],"meta":["December 2013Procedia Technology 9","DOI:10.1016/j.protcy.2013.12.080"],"references":["313573195_Improving_multiproject_management_by_using_a_queuing_theory_approach","292013545_Project_success_-_A_survey","238302835_Project_Management_in_the_information_systems_and_information_technologies","326120803_Book_Review_A_Guide_to_the_Project_Management_Body_of_Knowledge_PMBOKR_Guide_-_2000_EditionA_Guide_to_the_Project_Management_Body_of_Knowledge_PMBOKR_Guide_-_2000_EditionProject_Management_Institute_2","326120500_Project_Management_in_the_Information_Systems_and_Information_Technologies_Industries","297521489_Project_Management_Best_Practices_Achieving_Global_Excellence","292820775_Why_Web_projects_fail","255575342_Building_Project_Scope_Definition_Using_Project_Definition_Rating_Index","248345144_A_practical_use_of_key_success_factors_to_improve_the_effectiveness_of_project_management","239565161_The_capability_maturity_model_guidelines_for_improving_the_sofrware_process"]}
