{"id":"327473868_A_Reference_Framework_for_Conceptual_Modeling","abstract":"With decades of contributions and applications, conceptual modeling is very well-recognized in information systems engineering. However, the importance and relevance of conceptual modeling is less well understood in other disciplines. This paper, through an analysis of existing research and expert opinions, proposes a reference framework for conceptual modeling to help researchers and practitioners position their work in the field, facilitate discussion among researchers in the field, and help researchers and practitioners in other fields understand what the field of conceptual modeling has to offer as well as contribute to its continued, extended influence in multiple domains.","authors":["Lois Delcambre","Stephen Liddle","Oscar Pastor","Veda C.
