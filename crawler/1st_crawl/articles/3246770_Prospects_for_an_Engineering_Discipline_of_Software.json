{"id":"3246770_Prospects_for_an_Engineering_Discipline_of_Software","abstract":"Although software engineering is not yet a true engineering discipline, it has the potential to become one. Older engineering fields are examined to ascertain the character that software engineering might have. The current state of software technology is discussed, covering information processing as an economic force, the growing role of software in critical applications, the maturity of development techniques, and the scientific basis for software engineering practice. Five basic steps that the software engineering profession must take to become a true engineering discipline are described. They are: understanding the nature of expertise, recognizing different ways to get information, encouraging routine practice, expecting professional specializations, and improving the coupling between science and commercial practice.< >","authors":["Mary Shaw"],"meta":["December 1990IEEE Software 7(6):15 - 24","DOI:10.1109/52.60586","SourceIEEE Xplore"],"references":["220477127_No_Silver_Bullet_Essence_and_Accidents_of_Software_Engineering","291193584_Software_engineering_Report_on_a_conference_sponsored_by_the_nato_science_committee","290895165_The_Origins_of_Chemical_Engineering","273961984_A_History_of_Civil_Engineering_An_Outline_from_Ancient_to_Modern_Times","247033509_On_the_cruelty_of_really_teaching_computing_science","245822964_Cultural_Literacy_What_Every_American_Needs_To_Know","240249666_Software_for_the_Elementary_Functions","238720532_Report_on_a_conference_sponsored_by_the_NATO_Science_Committee","235169255_DoD_Related_Software_Technology_Requirements_Practices_and_Prospects_for_the_Future","235107663_What_a_Software_Engineer_Needs_to_Know_1_Program_Vocabulary","234800241_Sorting","223777571_Software_Manual_for_the_Elementary_Functions","222788325_Grand_challenges_to_computational_science","220477602_Education_for_Computing_Professionals","220423649_Grand_Challenges_to_Computation_Science","3046592_Software_Engineering"]}
