{"id":"263524045_Monthly_seasonality_in_currency_returns_1972-2010","abstract":"This study examines the monthly seasonality of foreign exchange (FX) returns for eight \nmajor currencies (against the us dollar) from 1972 to 2010. It finds that five currencies \nexhibit significantly higher returns in the month of December and a significant reversal in \nJanuary. Previous research has focused largely on the daily patterns within FX returns. \nWith global FX daily spot transactions reaching us$4 trillion dollars, these findings have \nimportant practical implications for currency hedgers, arbitrageurs and speculators.","authors":["Bin Li","Benjamin Liu","Robert J.
