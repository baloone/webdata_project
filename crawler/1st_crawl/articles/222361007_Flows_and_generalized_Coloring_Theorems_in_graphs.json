{"id":"222361007_Flows_and_generalized_Coloring_Theorems_in_graphs","abstract":"An (oriented) graph H is said to be Fk(k ≥ 2) iff there exists an integer flow in H with all edge-values in [1 − k, −1] ⌣ [1, k − 1]. It is known that a plane 2-edge-connected graph is face-colorable with k colors (k ≥ 2) iff it is Fk; W. T. Tutte has proposed [1] to seek for extensions to general graphs of coloring results known for planar graphs through the use of the Fk property. In this direction, we prove among other results that every 2-edge-connected graph is F8.","authors":["F Jaeger"],"meta":["April 1979Journal of Combinatorial Theory Series B 26(2):205-216","DOI:10.1016/0095-8956(79)90057-1","SourceDBLP"],"references":["265679967_Embeddings_and_orientations_of_graphs","265462541_Grotzsch's_theorem_on_3-colorings","265461649_Infinite_Families_of_Nontrivial_Trivalent_Graphs_Which_are_Not_Tait_Colorable","265427612_Finite_Permutation_Groups","265373653_Lectures_on_Matroids","265370658_A_Class_of_Abelian_Groups","265368210_A_Theorem_on_n-Coloring_the_Points_of_a_Linear_Graph","265352257_Graphes_et_Hypergraphes","243777084_A_Decomposition_for_Combinatorial_Geometries","243087453_Decomposition_of_Finite_Graphs_Into_Forests","243058874_Balanced_Valuations_and_Flows_in_Multigraphs","240927410_A_theorem_on_three-coloring_the_edges_of_a_trivalent_graph","239064938_A_Contribution_to_the_Theory_of_Chromatic_Polynomials","229336812_On_the_algebraic_theory_of_graph_coloring","228057707_Minimum_Partition_of_a_Matroid_into_Independent_Subsets","227093357_The_Tutte_polynomial","223116608_Bounds_on_the_number_of_disjoint_spanning_tess"]}
