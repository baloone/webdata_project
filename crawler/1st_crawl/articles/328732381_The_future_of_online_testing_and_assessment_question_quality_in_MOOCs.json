{"id":"328732381_The_future_of_online_testing_and_assessment_question_quality_in_MOOCs","abstract":"If MOOCs are to play a role in the future of higher education it is imperative that we\ncritically examine how they are currently functioning. In particular, questions persist\nabout the role MOOCs will play in the future of formal accredited learning. As the\nfocus turns from informal and free to formal, accredited and paid, greater scrutiny\nwill be brought to bear on the quality of the courses themselves. Although there\nhave been some empirical studies into the quality of MOOCs, a notable gap exists in\nthat such research has not examined Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) which are a\nkey component of much MOOC assessment and testing. Previous research suggests\nthat flawed MCQ items may compromise the reliability and validity of these\nassessments, potentially leading to inconsistent outcomes for students. This study\nwas hence designed to examine MCQ quality in MOOCs. 204 MCQs were analysed,\nfrom a selection of 18 MOOCs, sampling the domains of computing, social science\nand health sciences. Over 50% of MCQs (112) contained at least one item flaw; 57\nMCQs contained multiple flaws. A large proportion of MOOC MCQs violated itemwriting\nguidelines, which is comparable with previous studies examining the\nprevalence of flaws in assessments in more traditional educational contexts. The\nproblem of low quality MCQs can be ameliorated by appropriate faculty training and\npre- and post-test quality checks. These activities are essential if MOOCs are to\nbecome a force that can enable enhanced and improved pedagogies in the future\nof higher education, instead of simply proceeding to replicate existing poor practices\nat scale","authors":["Eamon Costello","Jane C.
