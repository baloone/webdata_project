{"id":"322977279_Survey_and_Classification_of_Model_Transformation_Tools","abstract":"Model transformation lies at the very core of model-driven engineering (MDE), and a large number of model transformation languages and tools have been proposed over the last few years. These tools can be used to develop, transform, merge, exchange, compare and verify models and metamodels. In this paper, we present a comprehensive catalogue of existing metamodel-based transformation tools and compare them using a qualitative framework. We begin by organizing the 60 tools we identified into a general classification based on the transformation approach used. We then compare these tools using a number of particular facets, where each facet belongs to one of six different categories and may contain several attributes. The results of the study are discussed in detail and made publicly available in a companion website with a capability to search for tools using the specified facets as search criteria. Our study provides a thorough picture of the state-of-the-art in model transformation techniques and tools. Our results are potentially beneficial to many stakeholders in the modeling community, including practitioners, researchers, and transformation tool developers.","authors":["Nafiseh Kahani","Mojtaba Bagherzadeh","James R.
