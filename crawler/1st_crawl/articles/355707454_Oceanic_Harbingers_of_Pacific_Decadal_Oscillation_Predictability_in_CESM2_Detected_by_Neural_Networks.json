{"id":"355707454_Oceanic_Harbingers_of_Pacific_Decadal_Oscillation_Predictability_in_CESM2_Detected_by_Neural_Networks","abstract":"Plain Language Summary\nThe Earth's oceans are capable of storing large amounts of heat with spatial patterns of ocean heat lasting for decades at a time. One such pattern is called the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO). As these patterns indicate how heat is distributed over the globe, they are associated with increased predictability of extreme weather events as well as being an important factor for marine ecosystems. Predicting when the PDO will shift from one pattern to the other has proven a tricky proposition in climate science as mechanisms from the atmosphere and the ocean both play a role. Here we show that artificial intelligence can predict PDO transitions over 12 months in advance. We also investigate the predictions and show that they are related to known physical mechanismsâ€”our models are making the right predictions for the right reasons. We leverage past knowledge, and the new discoveries from artificial intelligence to speculate how ocean patterns can lead to PDO predictability.","authors":["Emily M Gordon","Elizabeth A.
