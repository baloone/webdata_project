{"id":"315893666_Trees_vs_Neurons_Comparison_between_random_forest_and_ANN_for_high-resolution_prediction_of_building_energy_consumption","abstract":"Energy prediction models are used in buildings as a performance evaluation engine in advanced control and optimisation, and in making informed decisions by facility managers and utilities for enhanced energy efficiency. Simplified and data-driven models are often the preferred option where pertinent information for detailed simulation are not available and where fast responses are required. We compared the performance of the widely-used feed-forward back-propagation artificial neural network (ANN) with random forest (RF), an ensemble-based method gaining popularity in predictionâ€”for predicting the hourly HVAC energy consumption of a hotel in Madrid, Spain. Incorporating social parameters such as the numbers of guests marginally increased prediction accuracy in both cases. Overall, ANN performed marginally better than RF with root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 4.97 and 6.10 respectively. However, the ease of tuning and modelling with categorical variables offers ensemble-based algorithms an advantage for dealing with multi-dimensional complex data, typical in buildings. RF performs internal cross-validation (i.e. using out-of-bag samples) and only has a few tuning parameters. Both models have comparable predictive power and nearly equally applicable in building energy applications.","authors":["Muhammad Waseem Ahmad","Monjur Mourshed","Yacine Rezgui"],"meta":["July 2017Energy and Buildings 147","DOI:10.1016/j.enbuild.2017.04.038","Project: PERFORMER"],"references":["309634792_Application_of_a_Random_Forest_algorithm_to_predict_spatial_distribution_of_the_potential_yield_of_Ruditapes_philippinarum_in_the_Venice_lagoon_Italy","304334755_Optimal_scheduling_strategy_for_enhancing_indoor_air_quality_visual_and_thermal_comfort_using_a_genetic_algorithm","299339968_Building_energy_metering_and_environmental_monitoring_-_A_state-of-the-art_review_and_directions_for_future_research","295902522_Computational_intelligence_techniques_for_HVAC_systems_A_review","292784245_Optimising_the_scheduled_operation_of_window_blinds_to_enhance_occupant_comfort","287374606_Energy_Forecasting_for_Event_Venues_Big_Data_and_Prediction_Accuracy","281291155_Smart_Grid_Futures_Perspectives_on_the_Integration_of_Energy_and_ICT_Services","306150595_Neural_Networks_A_Comprehensive_Foundation","281526599_Contribution_of_working_groups_I_II_and_III_to_the_fourth_assessment_report_of_the_intergovernmental_panel_on_climate_change","275967361_Neural_Networks_A_Systematic_Introduction"]}
