{"id":"280291725_Data_Mining_Techniques_for_Detecting_Household_Characteristics_Based_on_Smart_Meter_Data","abstract":"The main goal of this research is to discover the structure of home appliances usage patterns, hence providing more intelligence in smart metering systems by taking into account the usage of selected home appliances and the time of their usage. In particular, we present and apply a set of unsupervised machine learning techniques to reveal specific usage patterns observed at an individual household. The work delivers the solutions applicable in smart metering systems that might: (1) contribute to higher energy awareness; (2) support accurate usage forecasting; and (3) provide the input for demand response systems in homes with timely energy saving recommendations for users. The results provided in this paper show that determining household characteristics from smart meter data is feasible and allows for quickly grasping general trends in data.","authors":["Krzysztof Gajowniczek","Tomasz ZÄ…bkowski"],"meta":["July 2015Energies 2015(8):7407-7427","DOI:10.3390/en8077407"],"references":["280530351_FORECASTING_OF_INDIVIDUAL_ELECTRICITY_USAGE_USING_SMART_METER_DATA","272278462_Non-Intrusive_Demand_Monitoring_and_Load_Identification_for_Energy_Management_Systems_Based_on_Transient_Feature_Analyses","321591535_Grade_Models_and_Methods_for_Data_Analysis_With_Applications_for_the_Analysis_of_Data_Populations","318685502_Mapping_Techniques_for_Exploratory_Pattern_Analysis","313364693_Understanding_domestic_energy_consumption_through_interactive_visualisation_a_field_study","313145413_Hierarchical_grouping_to_optimize_an_obiective_function","312879591_Some_distance_properties_of_latent_root_and_vector_methods_used_in_multivariate_data_analysis","289882392_El_Farol_Bar_problem_Potluck_problem_and_electric_energy_balancing_-_On_the_importance_of_communication","288446570_Intelligent_Computations_in_an_Agent-Based_Prosumer-Type_Electric_Microgrid_Control_System","272176868_Finding_Groups_in_Data_An_Introduction_to_Cluster_Analysis"]}
