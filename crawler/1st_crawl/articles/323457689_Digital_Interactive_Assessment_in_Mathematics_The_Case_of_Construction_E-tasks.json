{"id":"323457689_Digital_Interactive_Assessment_in_Mathematics_The_Case_of_Construction_E-tasks","abstract":"Our research focuses on the e-assessment of challenging calculus construction e-tasks designed to function as a dynamic interactive environment of multiple linked representations (MLR) that provide feedback to the learner. A construction e-task requires students to use technological affordances to construct examples that satisfy specific conditions. The e-task is checked automatically and intermediate actions and submitted answers are reported. We present here an example of a construction e-task and report on a pilot experiment designed to elucidate the role of the dynamic MLR environment in solving and assessing construction e-tasks. Specifically, we examine the studentâ€™s submitted solutions and analyse whether it helps reflect the reasoning behind the answer.","authors":["Galit Haddif","Michal Yerushalmy"],"meta":["February 2015","Conference: cerme9"],"references":[]}
