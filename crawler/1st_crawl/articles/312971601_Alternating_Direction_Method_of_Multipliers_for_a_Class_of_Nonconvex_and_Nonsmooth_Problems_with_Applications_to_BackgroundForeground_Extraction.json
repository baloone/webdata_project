To solve the resulting possibly nonconvex, nonsmooth, and non-Lipschitz optimization problem, we adapt the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) with a general dual step-size to solve a reformulation that contains three blocks of variables and analyze its convergence. We show that for any dual step-size less than the golden ratio, there exists a computable threshold such that if the penalty parameter is chosen above such a threshold and the sequence thus generated by our ADMM is bounded, then the cluster point of the sequence gives a stationary point of the nonconvex optimization problem. We achieve this via a potential function specifically constructed for our ADMM. Moreover, we establish the global convergence of the whole sequence if, in addition, this special potential function is a Kurdyka–Łojasiewicz function. Furthermore, we present a simple strategy for initializing the algorithm to guarantee boundedness of the sequence. Finally, we perform numerical experiments comparing our ADMM with the proximal alternating linearized minimization proposed in [Bolte, Sabach, and Teboulle, Math. Program., 146 (2014), pp. 459–494] on the background/foreground extraction problem with real data. The numerical results show that our ADMM with a nontrivial dual step-size is efficient.","authors":["Lei Yang","Ting Kei Pong","Xiaojun Chen"],"meta":["January 2017SIAM Journal on Imaging Sciences 10(1):74-110","DOI:10.1137/15M1027528","Project: Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers for a Class of Nonconvex and Nonsmooth Problems with Applications to Background/Foreground Extraction"],"references":["294289409_Alternating_direction_method_of_multipliers_for_penalized_zero-variance_discriminant_analysis","273178682_Efficient_Background_Modeling_Based_on_Sparse_Representation_and_Outlier_Iterative_Removal","272792309_The_direct_extension_of_ADMM_for_multi-block_convex_minimization_problems_is_not_necessarily_convergent","266319594_Douglas-Rachford_splitting_for_nonconvex_feasibility_problems","257480087_Proximal_alternating_linearized_minimization_for_nonconvex_and_nonsmooth_problems","226029783_On_the_Douglas-Rachford_splitting_method_and_the_proximal_point_algorithm_for_maximal_monotone_operators","220124442_Efficient_Reconstruction_of_Piecewise_Constant_Images_Using_Nonsmooth_Nonconvex_Minimization","261842135_Low-Rank_Plus_Sparse_Matrix_Decomposition_for_Accelerated_Dynamic_MRI_with_Separation_of_Background_and_Dynamic_Components","260354042_Low-Rank_Structure_Learning_via_Nonconvex_Heuristic_Recovery","258082013_Linearized_Alternating_Direction_Method_with_Parallel_Splitting_and_Adaptive_Penalty_for_Separable_Convex_Programs_in_Machine_Learning","225111070_Comments_on_Wavelets_in_statistics_A_review_by_A_Antoniadis","223969598_Robust_Recovery_of_Subspace_Structures_by_Low-Rank_Representation","220531338_A_Class_of_Linearized_Proximal_Alternating_Direction_Methods","51976756_RASL_Robust_Alignment_by_Sparse_and_Low-Rank_Decomposition_for_Linearly_Correlated_Images","47461003_Robust_PCA_via_outlier_pursuit","3191974_Constrained_parameters_and_the_recovery_of_discontinuities","1853672_Benchmarking_Optimization_Software_with_Performance_Profiles"]}
