CASC-J9 was the twenty-third competition in the CASC series. Twenty-three ATP systems and system variants competed in the various competition divisions. This paper presents an outline of the competition design, and a commentated summary of the results.","authors":["Geoff Sutcliffe"],"meta":["November 2018Ai Communications 31(1):1-13","DOI:10.3233/AIC-180773"],"references":["324457661_Unification_with_Abstraction_and_Theory_Instantiation_in_Saturation-Based_Reasoning","277679423_CakeML","228724593_Simple_and_Efficient_Clause_Subsumption_with_Feature_Vector_Indexing","327372487_Contradiction_separation_based_dynamic_multi-clause_synergized_automated_deduction","326075791_Efficient_Encodings_of_First-Order_Horn_Formulas_in_Equational_Logic","321279299_The_CADE-26_automated_theorem_proving_system_competition_-_CASC-26","319394475_The_CADE-16_ATP_system_competition","319363344_Non-clausal_Connection_Calculi_for_Non-classical_Logics","313366401_Blocked_Clauses_in_First-Order_Logic","305520991_The_CADE_ATP_System_Competition_-_CASC","303912892_nanoCoP_A_Non-clausal_Connection_Prover","301817608_Selecting_the_Selection","269005282_An_introduction_to_Godel's_theorems_Reprint_with_corrections_of_the_2007_original","266984900_StarExec_A_Cross-Community_Infrastructure_for_Logic_Solving","265438718_The_TPTP_problem_library_and_associated_infrastructure_ttthe_FOF_and_CNF_Parts_v350","223691029_Critical_pair_criteria_for_completion","222648893_Evaluating_general_purpose_automated_theorem_proving_systems","221342866_A_Non-clausal_Connection_Calculus","220805986_Ordered_Rewriting_and_Confluence"]}
