{"id":"282603514_Implementing_Efficient_All_Solutions_SAT_Solvers","abstract":"All solutions SAT (AllSAT for short) is a variant of propositional\nsatisfiability problem. Despite its significance, AllSAT has been relatively\nunexplored compared to other variants. We thus survey and discuss major\ntechniques of AllSAT solvers. We faithfully implement them and conduct\ncomprehensive experiments using a large number of instances and various types\nof solvers including one of the few public softwares. The experiments reveal\nsolver's characteristics. Our implemented solvers are made publicly available\nso that other researchers can easily develop their solver by modifying our\ncodes and compare it with existing methods.","authors":["Takahisa Toda","Takehide Soh"],"meta":["October 2015Journal of Experimental Algorithmics 21(1)","DOI:10.1145/2975585","SourcearXiv"],"references":["307174918_Mining_association_rules_between_sets_of_items_in_large_databases","305630007_Dualization_of_boolean_functions_using_ternary_decision_diagrams","300003469_On_Preprocessing_Techniques_and_Their_Impact_on_Propositional_Model_Counting","291425048_Discrete_Optimization_with_Decision_Diagrams","346696824_Efficient_SAT-based_unbounded_symbolic_model_checking_using_circuit_cofactoring","316163922_Conflict-driven_answer_set_solving","316163828_Head-elementary-set-free_logic_programs","307815949_BDD_construction_for_all_solutions_SAT_and_efficient_caching_mechanism","302937198_An_extensible_SAT-solver","298929390_A_compressed_breadth-first_search_for_satisfiability"]}
