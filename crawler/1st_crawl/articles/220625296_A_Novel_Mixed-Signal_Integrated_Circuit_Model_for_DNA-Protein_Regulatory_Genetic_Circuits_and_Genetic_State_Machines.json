{"id":"220625296_A_Novel_Mixed-Signal_Integrated_Circuit_Model_for_DNA-Protein_Regulatory_Genetic_Circuits_and_Genetic_State_Machines","abstract":"This paper discusses the formulation of ldquosilicon mimeticrdquo mixed-signal integrated circuit (IC) models for biocellular genetic circuits and state machines that utilize the rich variety of deoxyribonucleic acid and protein regulatory interactive pathways. A novel mixed-signal circuit model is reported for determining the state transitions of a genetic circuit. Using hysteretic electronic switch analogues for messenger ribonucleic acid transcription, a genetic state machine can be auto-triggered resulting in the self-timed transformation of an existing state of gene expression into another desired state of gene expression. Such an electronic model of genetic circuits and state machines focuses on the central theme of post-genomic research into gene-protein connectivity based cellular phenomenon. Novel synthetic genetic circuits designed using the mature resources of IC simulation will result in important outcomes for biomaterials based computation, bionanotechnology, as well as, gene and cell therapy.","authors":["s.
