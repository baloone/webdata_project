{"id":"335399910_Taxonomy_of_bio-inspired_optimization_algorithms","abstract":"Bio-Inspired optimization algorithms are inspired from principles of natural biological evolution and distributed collective of a living organism such as (insects, animal, …. etc.) for obtaining the optimal possible solutions for hard and complex optimization problems. In computer science Bio-Inspired optimization algorithms have been broadly used because of their exhibits extremely diverse, robust, dynamic, complex and fascinating phenomenon as compared to other existing classical techniques.This paper presents an overview study on the taxonomy of bio-inspired optimization algorithms according to the biological field that are inspired from and the areas where these algorithms have been successfully applied","authors":["Saman M.
