{"id":"281487729_Multi-Sensor_Slope_Change_Detection","abstract":"We develop a mixture procedure for multi-sensor systems to monitor parallel\nstreams of data for a change-point that causes a gradual degradation to a\nsubset of data streams. Observations are assumed initially to be normal random\nvariables with known constant means and variances. After a change-point the\nobservations in a subset of the streams of data have increasing or decreasing\nmean values. The subset and the slope changes are unknown. Our procedure uses a\nmixture statistics which assumes that each sensor is affected with probability\n$p_0$. Analytic expressions are obtained for the average run length (ARL) and\nthe expected detection delay (EDD) of the mixture procedure, which are\ndemonstrated to be quite accurate numerically. We establish asymptotic\noptimality of the mixture procedure. Numerical examples demonstrate the good\nperformance of the proposed procedure. We also discuss an adaptive mixture\nprocedure using empirical Bayes. This paper extends our earlier work on\ndetecting an abrupt change-point that causes a mean-shift, by tackling the\nchallenges posed by the non-stationarity of the slope-change problem.","authors":["Yang Cao","Yao Xie","Nagi Gebraeel"],"meta":["April 2018Annals of Operations Research 263(1-2)","DOI:10.1007/s10479-016-2185-5","SourcearXiv"],"references":["316800398_Springer_Series_in_Statistics","314714144_Sequential_Analysis_Tests_and_Confidence_Intervals","298086791_Information_bounds_and_quick_detection_of_parameter_changes_in_stochastic_systems","279458673_Optimal_detection_in_multi-stream_data","276373946_Quickest_Line_Outage_Detection_and_Identification","266913092_Second-Order_Asymptotic_Optimality_in_Multisensor_Sequential_Change_Detection","266749669_An_adaptive_functional_regression-based_prognostic_model_for_applications_with_missing_data","266542074_Extremes_in_Random_Fields_A_Theory_and_Its_Applications","266199572_The_Statistics_of_Gene_Mapping","265459088_Sequential_Analysis_Tests_and_Confidence_Intervals","260662503_A_Data-Level_Fusion_Model_for_Developing_Composite_Health_Indices_for_Degradation_Modeling_and_Prognostic_Analysis","265444368_Sequential_Changepoint_Detection_in_Quality-Control_and_Dynamical-Systems","265036133_Sequential_Analysis_Hypothesis_Testing_and_Changepoint_Detection","254332398_Mutivariate_CUSUM_quality_control_procedures","251867156_Damage_propagation_modeling_for_aircraft_engine_run-to-failure_simulation"]}
