{"id":"340583553_Discovering_Approximate_Gene_Clusters_as_a_Minimum-Weighted_Clique_Problem","abstract":"Given a complete weighted undirected graph G with both vertex and edge weights, the Weighted Clique Problem (WCP) is the problem of finding a clique in G of order m with extremal weight. A variant of WCP is the Minimum Edge-Weighted Clique Problem (Min-EWCP) where the vertex weights are all 0 but edge weights ≥ 0 and the problem is that of finding the clique in G of order m with the least weight. In this paper, the algorithm presented by Eremin et. al. for Min-EWCP was reviewed and another algorithm was presented along with its performance guarantee for the metric and the ultrametric set of inputs. A way to determine the performance guarantee as the strictness of the metricity is varied through a factor σ was also shown. Furthermore, this study presents the problem of identifying sets of commonly existing putative co-regulated, co-expressed genes, called gene clusters, as a clique-nding problem. A gene distance matrix was constructed from a genome database by obtaining the distances of each pair of genes in each genome. Finally, experimental results are shown where approximate gene clusters are obtained from putative orthologous genes of the genomes E.colistrK − 12 and B.subtilis.","authors":["Sun Arthur Ojeda","Geoffrey Aserios Solano","Bianca Camille Silmaro","Jaime D.
