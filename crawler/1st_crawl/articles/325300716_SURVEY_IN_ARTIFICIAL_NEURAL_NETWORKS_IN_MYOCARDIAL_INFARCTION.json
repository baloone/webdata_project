It contains more potential which has to be exploited by the human beings for sake of them. It helps to diagnose, to treat and to predict the outcome in many clinical scenarios as it have good relationship with a data set. Since accuracy and efficiency are the two principles needed for the better treatment to save the life of a human community, the proficiency in Artificial Intelligence is an essential high time need in all the fields of medicine. Based on this, the present paper tries to explore the various outlooks of AI in medicinal field.","authors":["Veena Sundareswaran"],"meta":["March 2018"],"references":["220605666_A_Very_Brief_History_of_Artificial_Intelligence","291291612_Artificial_intelligence_applications_in_power_systems","269003494_Logic_Machines_and_Diagrams","264383579_Machines_Who_Think","242919009_Use_of_an_Artificial_Neural_Network_for_Data_Analysis_in_Clinical_Decision-Making_The_Diagnosis_of_Acute_Coronary_Occlusion","240035342_Human_Robots_in_Myth_and_Science","238740116_Perceptrons-An_Introduction_to_Computational_Geometry","221996750_Artificial_Intelligence_-_A_Modern_Approach","22367690_Diagnosis_of_acute_abdominal_pain_with_computer_analysis","21407130_Reasoning_Foundations_of_Medical_Diagnosis"]}
