{"id":"264046382_Attributed_Graph_Kernels_Using_the_Jensen-Tsallis_q-Differences","abstract":"We propose a family of attributed graph kernels based on mutual information measures, i.e., the Jensen-Tsallis (JT) q-differences (for q\\in[1,2]) between probability distributions over the graphs. To this end, we first assign a probability to each vertex of the graph through a continuous-time quantum walk (CTQW). We then adopt the tree-index approach to strengthen the original vertex labels, and we show how the CTQW can induce a probability distribution over these strengthened labels. We show that our JT kernel (for q=1) overcomes the shortcoming of discarding non-isomorphic substructures arising in the R-convolution kernels. Moreover, we prove that the JT kernels generalize the Jensen-Shannon graph kernel (for q=1) and the classical subtree kernel (for q=2), respectively. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the JT kernels.","authors":["Lu Bai","Luca Rossi","Horst Bunke","Edwin Robert Hancock"],"meta":["September 2014","DOI:10.1007/978-3-662-44848-9_7","Conference: European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (ECML-PKDD), 2014"],"references":["260004676_Finding_Structural_Anomalies_in_Star_Graphs_Using_Quantum_Walks","256486374_Characterizing_graph_symmetries_through_quantum_Jensen-Shannon_divergence","228095685_Subgraph_Matching_Kernels_for_Attributed_Graphs","226805234_Possible_generalization_of_Boltzmann-Gibbs_statistics","221497506_On_Graph_Kernels_Hardness_Results_and_Efficient_Alternatives","221429878_The_wave_kernel_signature_A_quantum_mechanical_approach_to_shape_analysis","221345917_Marginalized_Kernels_Between_Labeled_Graphs","221345691_Fast_Neighborhood_Subgraph_Pairwise_Distance_Kernel","221344814_Extensions_of_marginalized_graph_kernels","220320857_Nonextensive_Information_Theoretic_Kernels_on_Measures","220320479_Probability_Product_Kernels","47843134_Efficient_Graphlet_Kernels_for_Large_Graph_Comparison","41781116_Marginalized_Kernels_between_Labeled_Graphs","2132180_Non-backtracking_random_walks_mix_faster","300441969_CLASSIFICATION_AND_CLUSTERING_OF_VECTOR_SPACE_EMBEDDED_GRAPHS","268026516_A_Unified_Framework_for_Strengthening_Topological_Node_Features_and_Its_Application_to_Subgraph_Isomorphism_Detection","263753801_Graph_Characteristics_from_the_Schrodinger_Operator","261357339_A_Quantum_Jensen-Shannon_Graph_Kernel_for_Unattributed_Graphs","260707708_Backtrackless_Walks_on_a_Graph","236110992_Graph_Kernels_from_the_Jensen-Shannon_Divergence","236110929_Jensen-Shannon_graph_kernel_using_information_functionals","221996125_Convolution_Kernels_on_Discrete_Structures","221617867_Fast_subtree_kernels_on_graphs","220843623_A_Family_of_Novel_Graph_Kernels_for_Structural_Pattern_Recognition","220359546_Graph_Classification_Based_on_Vector_Space_Embedding","50402384_Fast_subtree_kernels_on_graphs","4207736_Shortest-Path_Kernels_on_Graphs","2202218_Quantum_Computation_and_Decision_Trees","2189948_Quantum_random_walks_An_introductory_overview","1944045_Information_theoretical_properties_of_Tsallis_entropies"]}
