{"id":"289061857_Robust_pole_assignment_by_state_feedback_control_using_interval_analysis","abstract":"An interval analysis approach for the design of robust state feedback controllers is proposed. It is shown that when regional pole placement specifications are represented as spectral sets of interval polynomials, the robust state feedback design problem can be entirely formulated and solved in the context of the concepts and methods of interval analysis. Explicit convex polyhedral representations of a class of robust state feedback controllers satisfying an interval Ackerman's equation are derived. A design procedure based on nonlinear programming which aims at maximizing the non-fragility of the resulting robust controller is introduced. Numerical examples illustrate the design of robust state feedback controllers through the interval analysis approach proposed.","authors":["M.L.M. Prado","A.D.S. Lordelo","P.A.V.
