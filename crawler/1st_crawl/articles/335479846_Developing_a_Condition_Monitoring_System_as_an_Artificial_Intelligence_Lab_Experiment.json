{"id":"335479846_Developing_a_Condition_Monitoring_System_as_an_Artificial_Intelligence_Lab_Experiment","abstract":"A lab experiment to illustrate major concepts of artificial intelligence is proposed. For this, a condition monitoring application using a Raspberry Pi and Simulink is developed for a simple mechatronic system. The experiment is described in detail, example results are shown and the students' overall positive evaluation of the experiment is given.","authors":["Stephan Matzka","Andreas Franke"],"meta":["July 2019","DOI:10.1145/3345094.3345110","Conference: the 2019 4th International Conference"],"references":["3176349_Short_term_spectral_analysis_synthesis_and_modification_by_discrete_Fourier_transform","331758925_Using_Process_Quality_Prediction_to_Increase_Resource_Efficiency_in_Manufacturing_Processes","270348106_Discriminant_Analysis_and_Statistical_Pattern_Recognition"]}
