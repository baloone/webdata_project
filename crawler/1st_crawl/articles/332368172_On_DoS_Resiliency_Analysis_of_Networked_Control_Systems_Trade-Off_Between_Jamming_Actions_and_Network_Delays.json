{"id":"332368172_On_DoS_Resiliency_Analysis_of_Networked_Control_Systems_Trade-Off_Between_Jamming_Actions_and_Network_Delays","abstract":"This letter deals with the problem of quantifying resiliency of networked control systems (NCSs) to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and variable network delays. Internal exponential stability and \n$\\mathcal {L}_{{2}}$ \nexternal stability are studied. The closed-loop system is augmented with an auxiliary timer variable and analyzed in a hybrid system framework. Lyapunov-like conditions are given to ensure 0-input global exponential stability and \n$\\mathcal {L}_{{2}}$ \nexternal stability. A computationally affordable algorithm based on linear matrix inequalities is devised to provide tradeoff curves between maximum length of DoS attacks and largest network delays. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is shown in a numerical example.","authors":["Roberto Merco","Francesco Ferrante","Pierluigi Pisu"],"meta":["July 2019IEEE Control Systems Letters 3(3)","DOI:10.1109/LCSYS.2019.2911882","Project: Security of Distributed Cyber-Physical Systems with Connected  Vehicle Applications"],"references":["263164942_Detecting_integrity_attacks_on_SCADA_systems","345045714_mathcal_L_2_State_Estimation_With_Guaranteed_Convergence_Speed_in_the_Presence_of_Sporadic_Measurements","327193161_Resilient_Event-Triggered_Controller_Synthesis_of_Networked_Control_Systems_Under_Periodic_DoS_Jamming_Attacks","320219036_A_Comparison_Among_Deterministic_Packet-Dropouts_Models_in_Networked_Control_Systems","314194101_Resilient_control_under_Denial-of-Service_Robust_design","308533671_Event-Triggered_Control_Systems_Under_Denial-of-Service_Attacks","286490189_Survey_on_Recent_Advances_in_Networked_Control_Systems","277607377_Input-to-State_Stabilizing_Control_Under_Denial-of-Service","273536196_Finite-gain_L-p_stability_for_hybrid_dynamical_systems","273393805_Secure_Control_Systems_A_Quantitative_Risk_Management_Approach"]}
