{"id":"338618834_Development_of_application_for_control_of_SMART_parking_lot","abstract":"This article is focused on development of application to control SMART parking lot. Control is implemented via Virtual Instrumentation. First part of the article consists of brief description of actual state of similar applications based on Virtual Instrumentation. Following part focuses on BROADBANDLIGHT testing polygon situated next to Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Technical University of Ostrava. Last part of the article describes development of application that is suitable enough for control of SMART Light testing polygon.","authors":["Jan Baro≈°","Radek Martinek","Rene Jaros","Lukas Danys"],"meta":["January 2019IFAC-PapersOnLine 52(27):19-26","DOI:10.1016/j.ifacol.2019.12.726"],"references":["338614861_OFDM_VLC_System_Based_on_Virtual_Instrumentation_and_SDR","332433594_Visible_Light_Communication_System_Based_on_Software_Defined_Radio_Performance_Study_of_Intelligent_Transportation_and_Indoor_Applications","331408353_Effective_LabVIEW_Programming","291517437_A_novel_LabVIEW-Based_Multi-Channel_Non-Invasive_Abdominal_Maternal-Fetal_Electrocardiogram_Signal_Generator","257138572_Design_Implementation_of_Smart_House_Control_Using_LabVIEW","260627409_Advanced_LabView_Labs","3967643_A_LabVIEW_based_data_acquisition_system_for_vibration_monitoring_and_analysis"]}
