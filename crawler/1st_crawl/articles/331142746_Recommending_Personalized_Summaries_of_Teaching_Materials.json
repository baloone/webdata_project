{"id":"331142746_Recommending_Personalized_Summaries_of_Teaching_Materials","abstract":"Teaching activities have nowadays been supported by a variety of electronic devices. Formative assessment tools allow teachers to evaluate the level of understanding of learners during frontal lessons and to tailor the next teaching activities accordingly. Despite plenty of teaching materials are available in textual form, manually exploring these very large collections of documents can be extremely time consuming. The analysis of learner-produced data (e.g., test outcomes) can be exploited to recommend short extracts of teaching documents based on the actual learner’s needs. This paper proposes a new methodology to recommend summaries of potentially large teaching documents. Summary recommendations are customized to student’s needs according to the results of comprehension tests performed at the end of frontal lectures. Specifically, students undergo multiple-choice tests through a mobile application. In parallel, a set of topic-specific summaries of the teaching documents is generated. They consist of the most significant sentences related to a specific topic. According to the results of the tests, summaries are personally recommended to students. We assessed the applicability of the proposed approach in real context, i.e., a B.S. university-level course. The results achieved in the experimental evaluation confirmed its usability.","authors":["Luca Cagliero","Laura Farinetti","Elena Baralis"],"meta":["February 2019IEEE Access PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2899655"],"references":["311313570_An_experiment_with_separate_formative_and_summative_rubrics_in_educational_peer_assessment","289991570_A_Review_on_Predicting_Student's_Performance_Using_Data_Mining_Techniques","271473217_ACO-based_media_content_adaptation_for_e-learning_environments","262372065_Improving_retention_Predicting_at-risk_students_by_analysing_clicking_behaviour_in_a_virtual_learning_environment","220345110_Integrating_Document_Clustering_and_Multidocument_Summarization","220269816_Summarizing_biological_literature_with_BioSumm","319637673_Test-Driven_Summarization_Combining_Formative_Assessment_with_Teaching_Document_Summarization","313606501_Mining_Association_rules_between_sets_of_items_in_large_databases","311316045_Introducing_BeA_into_Self-Regulated_Learning_to_provide_Formative_Assessment_support","307786143_Open_Learning_Platform_Based_on_Personal_and_Social_Analytics_for_Individualized_Learning_Support","305092631_Impact_of_a_Formative_e-Assessment_on_Learning_Outcomes_A_Pilot_Study_on_a_Social_and_Behavioural_Sciences_Course_College_of_Health_Sciences_University_of_Bahrain","303950479_Formative_Assessment_in_English_for_Specific_Purposes","303093966_Predicting_Instructor_Performance_Using_Data_Mining_Techniques_in_Higher_Education","298346147_Unsupervised_modeling_for_understanding_MOOC_discussion_forums","283835043_Learning_From_Summaries_Supporting_e-Learning_Activities_by_Means_of_Document_Summarization","282073861_MWI-Sum_A_Multilingual_Summarizer_Based_on_Frequent_Weighted_Itemsets","262293023_Learning_analytics_Drivers_developments_and_challenges","262207138_Emerging_topic_detection_for_organizations_from_microblogs","261487777_Personalized_Text_Content_Summarizer_for_Mobile_Learning_An_Automatic_Text_Summarization_System_with_Relevance_Based_Language_Model","261312725_Towards_Efficient_Provision_of_Feedback_Supported_by_Learning_Analytics","260519585_Assessing_Intervention_Timing_in_Computer-Based_Education_Using_Machine_Learning_Algorithms","240199919_Multi-document_Summarization_based_on_the_Yago_Ontology","233779932_E-Learning_online_learning_and_distance_learning_environments_Are_they_the_same","232483882_Educational_psychology_Effective_teaching_effective_learning","221608231_Generating_summary_keywords_for_emails_using_topics","220790051_Multi-document_Text_Summarization_in_E-learning_System_for_Operating_System_Domain","200110620_Introduction_to_Data_Mining"]}
