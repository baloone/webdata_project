{"id":"348816849_An_Information_Theory_Approach_to_Aesthetic_Assessment_of_Visual_Patterns","abstract":"The question of beauty has inspired philosophers and scientists for centuries. Today, the study of aesthetics is an active research topic in fields as diverse as computer science, neuroscience, and psychology. Measuring the aesthetic appeal of images is beneficial for many applications. In this paper, we will study the aesthetic assessment of simple visual patterns. The proposed approach suggests that aesthetically appealing patterns are more likely to deliver a higher amount of information over multiple levels in comparison with less aesthetically appealing patterns when the same amount of energy is used. The proposed approach is evaluated using two datasets; the results show that the proposed approach is more accurate in classifying aesthetically appealing patterns compared to some related approaches that use different complexity measures.","authors":["Abdullah Khalili","Hamid Bouchachia"],"meta":["January 2021Entropy 23(2):153","DOI:10.3390/e23020153"],"references":["348428986_Artificial_Neural_Networks_and_Deep_Learning_in_the_Visual_Arts_a_review","344989194_Aesthetics_and_Entropy_III_Aesthetic_Measures","341687982_Relationship_Between_Visual_Complexity_and_Aesthetics_of_Webpages","341011181_Perceptual_image_quality_assessment_a_survey","334105265_Will_the_Machine_Like_Your_Image_Automatic_Assessment_of_Beauty_in_Images_with_Machine_Learning_Techniques","355382765_Computational_Aesthetics_of_Fine_Art_Paintings_The_State_of_the_Art_and_Outlook","348491842_Computational_Approaches_to_Aesthetic_Quality_Assessment_of_Digital_Photographs_State_of_the_Art_and_Future_Research_Directives","346621211_Image_Aesthetics_Assessment_Based_on_Multi-stream_CNN_Architecture_and_Saliency_Features","340554781_GANmera_Reproducing_Aesthetically_Pleasing_Photographs_Using_Deep_Adversarial_Networks","340355363_A_Quantitative_Approach_to_Measure_Webpage_Aesthetics"]}
