{"id":"325573413_Concept_of_Temporal_Data_Retrieval_Undefined_Value_Management","abstract":"Data validity, reliability and correctness of the results form the core of information system. Each data tuple can be bordered by the time definition. Multiple temporal approaches have been developed for different conditions and environment properties. One of the most significant data aspect is just the time. Solutions, in which data were updated in a strictly expected way, granularity and frequency are over. Therefore, we propose an attribute-oriented temporal model with reflection on data grouping technologies. Many times, data obtained from the sensors or measuring equipment are not relevant, reliable or are provided too late. For these reasons, undefined values must be stored in the database in the form of time itself or attribute expressing the state of the object. This paper deals with undefined values compromising performance and data access methods. We also propose definition and management using database objects and pointers. In the performance evaluation section, multiple indexes are compared to declare performance of our proposed solution in comparison with existing methods.","authors":["Michal Kvet","K.
