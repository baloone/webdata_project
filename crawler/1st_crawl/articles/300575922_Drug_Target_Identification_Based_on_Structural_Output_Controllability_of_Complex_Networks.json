{"id":"300575922_Drug_Target_Identification_Based_on_Structural_Output_Controllability_of_Complex_Networks","abstract":"Identifying drug target is one of the most important tasks in systems biology. In this paper, we develop a method to identify drug targets in biomolecular networks based on the structural output controllability of complex networks. The drug target identification has been formulated as a problem of finding steering nodes in networks. By applying control signals to these nodes, the biomolecular networks can be transited from one state to another. According to the control theory, a graph-theoretic algorithm has been proposed to find a minimum set of steering nodes in biomolecular networks which can be a potential set of drug targets. An illustrative example shows how the proposed method works. Application results of the method to real metabolic networks are supported by existing research results.","authors":["Lin Wu","Yichao Shen","Min Li","Fang-Xiang Wu"],"meta":["June 2014","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-08171-7_17","Conference: International Symposium on Bioinformatics Research and Applications"],"references":["321663699_Integrating_Protein-Protein_Interaction_Networks_with_Gene-_Gene_Co-Expression_Networks_improves_Gene_Signatures_for_Classifying_Breast_Cancer_Metastasis","261920689_Transittability_of_complex_networks_and_its_applications_to_regulatory_biomolecular_networks","249965508_Discovery_of_a_kernel_for_controlling_biomolecular_regulatory_networks","242333283_Realistic_Control_of_Network_Dynamics","231743151_Control_Centrality_and_Hierarchical_Structure_in_Complex_Networks","228116419_Nodal_Dynamics_Not_Degree_Distributions_Determine_the_Structural_Controllability_of_Complex_Networks","228101603_Network-based_characterization_of_drug-regulated_genes_drug_targets_and_toxicity","51898937_Integrating_Protein-Protein_Interaction_Networks_with_Gene-Gene_Co-Expression_Networks_improves_Gene_Signatures_for_Classifying_Breast_Cancer_Metastasis","51234826_Two-stage_flux_balance_analysis_of_metabolic_networks_for_drug_target_identification","51117462_Controllability_of_complex_networks","49689407_Network_Medicine_A_Network-based_Approach_to_Human_Disease","47644669_Proof_of_Concept_Network_and_Systems_Biology_Approaches_Aid_in_the_Discovery_of_Potent_Anticancer_Drug_Combinations","46818401_A_systems_biology_approach_to_identify_effective_cocktail_drugs","41103157_Associating_Genes_and_Protein_Complexes_with_Disease_via_Network_Propagation","37509382_Determination_of_Generic_Dimensions_of_Controllable_Subspaces_and_Its_Application","23452285_Finding_multiple_target_optimal_intervention_in_disease-related_molecular_network","12709522_KEGG_kyoto_Encyclopedia_of_Genes_and_Genomes","7928620_The_efficiency_of_multi-target_drugs_The_network_approach_might_help_drug_design","7167941_Predicting_disease_genes_using_proteinCprotein_interactions","6435186_Anti-Inflammatory_Activity_of_a_Potent_Selective_Leukotriene_A4_Hydrolase_Inhibitor_in_Comparison_with_the_5-Lipoxygenase_Inhibitor_Zileuton","5621595_Mining_metabolic_network_for_optimal_drug_targets","317415439_Modern_control_engineering","313581179_Mathematical_description_of_linear_dynamical_systems","309629827_Applied_Nonlinear_Control","297040568_Structural_controllability","255823668_Applied_Nonlinear_Control","234794391_Modern_Control_Engineering","223081265_LTC4-synthase_A-444C_polymorphism_Lack_of_association_with_NSAID-induced_isolated_periorbital_angioedema_in_a_Spanish_population","220045413_Mathematical_Description_of_Linear_Dynamical_Systems","40040914_Detecting_drug_targets_with_minimum_side_effects_in_metabolic_networks","9066434_Innovation_Target_discovery","5237781_Identification_of_Information_Flow-Modulating_Drug_Targets_A_Novel_Bridging_Paradigm_for_Drug_Discovery","3020649_Note_on_a_Graph-Theoretic_Criterion_for_Structural_Output_Controllability"]}
