{"id":"349644030_Synthesis_of_CNOT-Dihedral_circuits_with_optimal_number_of_two_qubit_gates","abstract":"In this note we present explicit canonical forms for all the elements in the two-qubit CNOT-Dihedral group, with minimal numbers of controlled-S (CS) and controlled-X (CX) gates, using the generating set of quantum gates [X,T,CX,CS]. We provide an algorithm to successively construct the n-qubit CNOT-Dihedral group, asserting an optimal number of controlled-X (CX) gates. These results are needed to estimate gate errors via non-Clifford randomized benchmarking and may have further applications to circuit optimization over fault-tolerant gate sets.","authors":["Shelly Garion","Andrew Cross"],"meta":["December 2020Quantum 4:369","DOI:10.22331/q-2020-12-07-369"],"references":["352667245_Optimal_two-qubit_circuits_for_universal_fault-tolerant_quantum_computation","349741011_Experimental_implementation_of_non-Clifford_interleaved_randomized_benchmarking_with_a_controlled-S_gate","320564691_Automated_optimization_of_large_quantum_circuits_with_continuous_parameters","320517049_The_disjointness_of_stabilizer_codes_and_limitations_on_fault-tolerant_logical_gates","312031107_A_Finite_Presentation_of_CNOT-Dihedral_Operators","282790321_Scalable_randomized_benchmarking_of_non-Clifford_gates","280970985_Gauge_color_codes_Optimal_transversal_gates_and_gauge_fixing_in_topological_stabilizer_codes","274263001_Estimating_the_Coherence_of_Noise","232709800_Process_verification_of_two-qubit_quantum_gates_by_randomized_benchmarking","225187388_A_Meet-in-the-Middle_Algorithm_for_Fast_Synthesis_of_Depth-Optimal_Quantum_Circuits","221719867_Efficient_Measurement_of_Quantum_Gate_Error_by_Interleaved_Randomized_Benchmarking","2201176_Elementary_gates_for_quantum_computation","1893772_Transversality_Versus_Universality_for_Additive_Quantum_Codes","321604187_On_the_CNOT-complexity_of_CNOT-PHASE_circuits","321571158_An_Efficient_Quantum_Compiler_that_reduces_T_count","317164072_Shorter_Stabilizer_Circuits_via_Bruhat_Decomposition_and_Quantum_Circuit_Transformations","316029599_Quantification_and_Characterization_of_Leakage_Errors","303839997_Unifying_Gate_Synthesis_and_Magic_State_Distillation","301879305_Universal_Gate_for_Fixed-Frequency_Qubits_via_a_Tunable_Bus","281312570_Characterizing_Universal_Gate_Sets_via_Dihedral_Benchmarking","260756038_Optimal_ancilla-free_CliffordT_approximation_of_z-rotations","255983557_An_algorithm_for_the_T-count","236914239_Classification_of_Topologically_Protected_Gates_for_Local_Stabilizer_Codes","51942255_Characterizing_Quantum_Gates_via_Randomized_Benchmarking","51185722_Scalable_and_Robust_Randomized_Benchmarking_of_Quantum_Processes","31956533_Demonstrating_the_viability_of_universal_quantum_computation_using_teleportation_and_single-qubit_operations","6331567_Topological_Computation_without_Braiding","2202154_Stabilizer_Codes_and_Quantum_Error_Correction","2193117_Improved_Simulation_of_Stabilizer_Circuits","1897552_Randomized_Benchmarking_of_Quantum_Gates"]}
