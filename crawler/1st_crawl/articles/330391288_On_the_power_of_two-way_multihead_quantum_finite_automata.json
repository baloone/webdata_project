{"id":"330391288_On_the_power_of_two-way_multihead_quantum_finite_automata","abstract":"This paper introduces a variant of two-way quantum finite automata named two-way multihead quantum finite automata. A two-way quantum finite automaton is more powerful than classical two-way finite automata. However, the generalizations of two-way quantum finite automata have not been defined so far as compared to one-way quantum finite automata model. We have investigated the newly introduced automata from two aspects: the language recognition capability and its comparison with classical and quantum counterparts. It has been proved that a language which cannot be recognized by any one-way and multi-letter quantum finite automata can be recognized by two-way quantum finite automata. Further, it has been shown that a language which cannot be recognized by two-way quantum finite automata can be recognized by two-way multihead quantum finite automata with two heads. Furthermore, it has been investigated that quantum variant of two-way deterministic multihead finite automata takes less number of heads to recognize a language containing of all words whose length is a prime number.","authors":["Amandeep Singh Bhatia","Ajay Loura"],"meta":["January 2019RAIRO - Theoretical Informatics and Applications 53(1)","DOI:10.1051/ita/2018020"],"references":["322527555_Quantifying_matrix_product_state","304789239_2-tape_1-way_Quantum_Finite_State_Automata","303690856_1-Way_Multihead_Quantum_Finite_State_Automata","247769636_On_the_State_Complexity_of_Semi-quantum_Finite_Automata","230876408_Finite_Automata_and_Their_Decision_Problems","225250518_Multi-letter_quantum_finite_automata_Decidability_of_the_equivalence_and_minimization_of_states","222402827_Two-way_finite_automata_with_quantum_and_classical_state","221663743_State_succinctness_of_two-way_finite_automata_with_quantum_and_classicalstates","221212583_Multi-letter_Reversible_and_Quantum_Finite_Automata","220486529_Multi-Head_Finite_Automata_Characterizations_Concepts_and_Open_Problems","51963946_Some_Languages_Recognized_by_Two-Way_Finite_Automata_with_Quantum_andClassical_States","51888284_Two-Tape_Finite_Automata_with_Quantum_and_Classical_States","45857183_Multi-Head_Finite_Automata_Characterizations_Concepts_and_Open_Problems","328667186_Modeling_of_RNA_secondary_structures_using_two-way_quantum_finite_automata","312263971_Promise_problems_solved_by_quantum_and_classical_finite_automata","310781733_One-way_reversible_multi-head_finite_automata","291942453_Simulating_Physics_with_Computers","291177525_One-Way_Reversible_Multi-head_Finite_Automata","289821989_A_Deterministic_Two-Way_Multi-head_Finite_Automaton_Can_Be_Converted_into_a_Reversible_One_with_the_Same_Number_of_Heads","266860980_Handbook_of_Finite_State_Based_Models_and_Applications","265564295_Quantum_Computation_and_Quantum_Information_10th_Anniversary_Edition","236647771_On_the_complexity_of_minimizing_probabilistic_and_quantum_automata","236202967_Power_of_the_interactive_proof_systems_with_verifiers_modeled_by_semi-quantum_two-way_finite_automata","234829070_On_Multi-head_Finite_Automata","226844750_Quantum_Computers","226810696_Simulating_physics_with_computers_Int_J_Theor_Phys_2167467-488","225495929_Characterization_of_Sequential_Quantum_Machines","223941827_Determination_of_equivalence_between_quantum_sequential_machines","223489729_Complexity_of_multi-head_finite_automata_Origins_and_directions","223012690_Determining_the_equivalence_for_one-way_quantum_finite_automata","222672642_Reversible_Space_Equals_Deterministic_Space","222556747_Quantum_Automata_and_Quantum_Grammars","221591257_Undecidability_on_Quantum_Finite_Automata","220574773_On_Two-way_Multihead_Automata","220443533_Two-Way_Reversible_Multi-Head_Finite_Automata","220247083_Bounded-Reversal_Multihead_Finite_Automata_Languages","220165864_Two-Way_Multihead_Automata_Over_a_One-Letter_Alphabet","220148394_Characterizations_of_quantum_automata","45871377_Exponentially_more_concise_quantum_recognition_of_non-RMM_regular_languages","31598223_On_Deterministic_Two-Way_Finite_Automata_Over_a_Unary_Alphabet","23566203_Hierarchy_and_equivalence_of_multi-letter_quantum_finite_automata","3728293_On_the_power_of_quantum_finite_state_automata","2661734_Algorithms_for_Quantum_Computation_Discrete_Logarithms_and_Factoring","2201607_Fast_quantum_mechanical_algorithm_for_database_search"]}
