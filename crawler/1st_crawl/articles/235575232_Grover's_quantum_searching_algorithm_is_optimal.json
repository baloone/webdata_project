{"id":"235575232_Grover's_quantum_searching_algorithm_is_optimal","abstract":"I show that for any number of oracle lookups up to about π/4√N, Grover’s quantum searching algorithm gives the maximal possible probability of finding the desired element. I explain why this is also true for quantum algorithms which use measurements during the computation. I also show that unfortunately quantum searching cannot be parallelized better than by assigning different parts of the search space to independent quantum computers.","authors":["Christof Zalka"],"meta":["October 1999Physical review A, Atomic, molecular, and optical physics 60(4)","DOI:10.1103/PhysRevA.60.2746"],"references":["2201460_Distinguishability_and_Accessible_Information_in_Quantum_Theory","319523609_Tight_Bounds_on_Quantum_Searching","255904253_Quantum_Mechanics_Helps_in_Searching_for_a_Needle_in_a_Haystack","244955874_A_fast_mechanical_algorithm_for_database_search","220617297_Strengths_and_Weakness_of_Quantum_Computing","2201607_Fast_quantum_mechanical_algorithm_for_database_search","2201598_Tight_bounds_on_quantum_searching"]}
