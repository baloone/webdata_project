{"id":"261587684_A_stochastic_model_of_a_reconfigurable_manufacturing_system_Part_1_A_framework","abstract":"Products required by customers are classified into several product families, each of which is a set of similar products. A reconfigurable manufacturing system (RMS) manages to satisfy customers, with each family corresponding to one configuration of the RMS. Then the products belonging to the same family will be produced by the RMS under the corresponding configuration. The manufacturing system possesses the reconfigurable function for different families. In an RMS there are three important issues: the optimal configurations in the design, the optimal selection policy in the utilization, and the performance measure in the improvement. This paper proposes a framework for a stochastic model of an RMS, which involves the above issues. Two optimization problems and the performance measure stemmed from the issues are formulated. An example is given for illustration. Some discussions are presented for future research work.","authors":["Zhao Xiaobo","Jian-cai Wang","Luo Zhenbi"],"meta":["November 2010International Journal of Production Research 38(10):2273-2285","DOI:10.1080/00207540050028098"],"references":["227252568_Reconfigurability_consideration_design_of_components_and_manufacturing_systems","2725846_Heuristic_Scheduling_of_Parallel_Heterogeneous_Queues_with_Set-Ups","294126653_Operation_plug-and-play_is_on_the_way","290799136_Project_scheduling_algorithms_for_re-layout_projects","250718266_Physically_reconfigurable_virtual_cells_A_dynamic_model_for_a_highly_dynamic_environment","246201659_Flexible_machine_layout_design_for_dynamic_and_uncertain_production_conditions","245176733_Facility_Layout_Design_in_a_Changing_Environment","226056246_Project_scheduling_algorithms_for_re-layout_projects","222794320_Flexible_machine_layout_design_for_dynamic_and_uncertain_production_environments_European_Journal_of_Operational_Research_108_49-64","222049252_A_computer_based_production_scheduling_architecture_suitable_for_driving_a_reconfigurable_manufacturing_system","221949409_New_developments_in_assembly_systems_CIRP_Ann_Manuf_Technol","23526212_A_new_comprehensive_sheared_delay_formula_for_traffic_signal_optimisation","3021013_Customer_Scheduling_Under_Queueing_Constraints"]}
