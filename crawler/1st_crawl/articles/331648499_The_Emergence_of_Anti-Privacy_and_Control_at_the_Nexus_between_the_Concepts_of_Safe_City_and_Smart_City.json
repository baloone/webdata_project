{"id":"331648499_The_Emergence_of_Anti-Privacy_and_Control_at_the_Nexus_between_the_Concepts_of_Safe_City_and_Smart_City","abstract":"The emergence of Big Data, accelerated through the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence, from the emerging, contemporary concept of smart cities coupled with that of the notion for safe cities is raising concerns of privacy and good governance that are impacting on socioeconomic and liveability dimensions of urban fabrics. As these gain ground, largely due to economic pressures from large ICT providers, there is a notable increase towards the need for inclusion of human dimensions, complemented by the use of technology. However, the latter is seen as catalysing elements of control and propaganda which are thriving through oversimplified and non-inclusive urban IT policy measures. This paper dwells on the intersecting subjects of smart and safe cities and explores the highlighted issues that are deemed to cause concern and further explore the need for transparency and inclusivity in urban processes and systems. This paper is oriented towards urban planners and policy makers looking at the implementation of smart and safe cities concepts.","authors":["Zaheer Allam"],"meta":["March 2019Smart Cities 2(1):96-105","DOI:10.3390/smartcities2010007","Project: Smart Cities"],"references":["330896205_Prevailing_and_emerging_cyber_threats_and_security_practices_in_IoT-Enabled_smart_grids_A_survey","330229850_The_Agile_Deployment_of_Machine_Learning_Models_in_Healthcare","330039327_On_Smart_Contracts_and_Organisational_Performance_A_Review_Of_Smart_Contracts_Through_the_Blockchain_Technology","329388310_Redefining_the_Smart_City_Culture_Metabolism_and_Governance_Case_Study_of_Port_Louis_Mauritius","329364285_Contextualising_the_Smart_City_for_Sustainability_and_Inclusivity","341591855_Practical_approaches_to_big_data_privacy_over_time","336810185_How_do_we_understand_smart_cities_An_evolutionary_perspective","330618921_On_Big_Data_Artificial_Intelligence_and_Smart_Cities","329329068_An_IoT_service_ecosystem_for_Smart_Cities_The_SmartME_project","329213165_Potential_pitfalls_in_the_development_of_smart_cities_and_mitigation_measures_An_exploratory_study"]}
