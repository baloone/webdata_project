{"id":"340285012_Recurrent_Experience_Replay_in_Distributed_Reinforcement_Learning","abstract":"Building on the recent successes of distributed training of RL agents, in this paper\nwe investigate the training of RNN-based RL agents from distributed prioritized\nexperience replay. We study the effects of parameter lag resulting in representational drift and recurrent state staleness and empirically derive an improved\ntraining strategy. Using a single network architecture and fixed set of hyperparameters, the resulting agent, Recurrent Replay Distributed DQN, quadruples\nthe previous state of the art on Atari-57, and matches the state of the art on\nDMLab-30. It is the first agent to exceed human-level performance in 52 of the\n57 Atari games.","authors":["Steven Kapturowski","Georg Ostrovski","John Quan","Remi Munos"],"meta":["May 2019","Conference: ICLR"],"references":[]}
