{"id":"305979504_On_the_busy_period_of_the_modified_GIG1_queue","abstract":"Proceeding from duality results for the GI/G/1 queue, this paper obtains the probability of the number served in a busy period of a GI / G /1 system where customers initiating a busy period have a different service time distribution from other customers. Using duality arguments for processes with interchangeable increments, the Laplace transform of the busy period duration is found for a modified GI/M/1 queue.","authors":["Anthony G.
