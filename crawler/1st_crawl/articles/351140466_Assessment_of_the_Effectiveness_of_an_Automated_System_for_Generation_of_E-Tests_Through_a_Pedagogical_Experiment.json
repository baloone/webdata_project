{"id":"351140466_Assessment_of_the_Effectiveness_of_an_Automated_System_for_Generation_of_E-Tests_Through_a_Pedagogical_Experiment","abstract":"After reviewing existing e-test generation systems, the problem encountered in pedagogical practice is the lack of integrated automated systems for testing knowledge in programming that replace the manual work of university lecturers in creating tests with automated approach. In order to support the teaching work, the “TestLab” Automated Test Generation System was developed, which rapidly generates and verifies e-tests in the training of students in reading program code. With regard to implementation of the “TestLab” in the programming training process, an experimental study was conducted to consider the effectiveness of the system related to the motivation of young people in the learning process and their academic achievements. In this survey, 137 students in specialty “Informatics and Computer Science” from the University of Library Studies and Information Technologies – ULSIT were involved, divided into two groups – experimental and control ones. The results of the realized pedagogical experiment showed a better performance level correctly solved test questions and time to solve each test as well as better motivation in the learning process in the experimental group, which repeatedly used the “TestLab” in comparison with the control group once worked with the test system. The results obtained confirm the assumption of the effectiveness of the implementation of the “TestLab” to improve the process of programming training in the higher education system.","authors":["Iva Kostadinova","Magdalena Garvanova","Ivan Ivanov","Katia Rasheva-Yordanova"],"meta":["April 2021Yearbook of Pedagogy 93(3):321-333"],"references":[]}
