{"id":"220628411_Toward_a_Revolution_in_Transportation_Operations_AI_for_Complex_Systems","abstract":"This article presents an parallel traffic management system for integrated control and management of urban transportation systems. This system's construction and operation are based on the ACP (artificial, computational, parallel) approach, which consists of modeling with artificial systems, analysis with computational experiments, and operation through parallel execution for control and management of complex systems with social and behavioral dimensions.","authors":["Fei-Yue Wang"],"meta":["November 2008Intelligent Systems, IEEE 23(6):8-13","DOI:10.1109/MIS.2008.112","SourceDBLP"],"references":["220628358_Intelligent-Commerce_Research_in_China","317264518_Artificial_Power_Systems_for_the_Operation_and_Management_of_Comolex_Power_Grids","317169038_Computational_Experiments_for_Behavior_Analysis_and_Decision_Evaluation_of_Complex_Systems","317037605_Agent-Based_Control_for_Networked_Traffic_Management_Systems","303009694_On_the_modeling_analysis_control_and_management_of_complex_systems","266537911_Parallel_system_methods_for_management_and_control_of_complex_systems","224370746_DynaCAS_Computational_Experiments_and_Decision_Support_for_ITS","220628871_Artificial_Societies_for_Integrated_and_Sustainable_Development_of_Metropolitan_Systems","3454517_Toward_a_Paradigm_Shift_in_Social_Computing_The_ACP_Approach","3454342_Driving_into_the_Future_with_ITS","3454278_Wang_FY_Agent-based_control_for_networked_traffic_management_systems_IEEE_Intell_Syst_205_92-96"]}
