{"id":"343615552_Decision-Making_Analysis_Based_on_Fuzzy_Graph_Structures","abstract":"A graph structure is a useful framework to solve the combinatorial problems in various fields of computational intelligence systems and computer science. In this research article, the concept of fuzzy sets is applied to the graph structure to define certain notions of fuzzy graph structures. Fuzzy graph structures can be very useful in the study of various structures, including fuzzy graphs, signed graphs, and the graphs having labeled or colored edges. The notions of the fuzzy graph structure, lexicographic-max product, and degree and total degree of a vertex in the lexicographic-max product are introduced. Further, the proposed concepts are explained through several numerical examples. In particular, applications of the fuzzy graph structures in decision-making process, regarding detection of marine crimes and detection of the road crimes, are presented. Finally, the general procedure of these applications is described by an algorithm.","authors":["Ali Koam","Muhammad Akram","Peide Liu"],"meta":["August 2020Mathematical Problems in Engineering 2020(9)","DOI:10.1155/2020/6846257"],"references":["342157348_Granulation_of_ecological_networks_under_fuzzy_soft_environment","342060146_An_optimization_study_based_on_Dijkstra_algorithm_for_a_network_with_trapezoidal_picture_fuzzy_numbers","341325882_Systems_of_Neutrosophic_Linear_Equations","340382770_Neutrosophic_structured_element","330291953_Certain_fuzzy_graph_structures","330287762_Fuzzy_Graph_Structures_with_Application","348900638_On_Lexicographic_Products_of_Two_Fuzzy_Graphs","338981643_Fuzzy_Hypergraphs","330895087_Wiener_index_of_a_fuzzy_graph_and_application_to_illegal_immigration_networks","324471923_A_study_on_generalized_fuzzy_graphs"]}
