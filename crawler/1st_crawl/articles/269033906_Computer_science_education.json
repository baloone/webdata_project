{"id":"269033906_Computer_science_education","abstract":"I would suggest that one of the central problems of computer science today is understanding what it's for. As a consequence, given this hypothesis, from an educational standpoint it is not clear what students are expected to represent when they graduate with degrees in computer science. To the potential employer, the situation becomes even more confused when (in better times) he believes he is recruiting one thing and finds that he has hired something else.","authors":["M.
