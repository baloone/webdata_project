{"id":"9081596_Automated_identification_of_diabetic_retinal_exudates_in_digital_colour_images","abstract":"To identify retinal exudates automatically from colour retinal images.\nThe colour retinal images were segmented using fuzzy C-means clustering following some key preprocessing steps. To classify the segmented regions into exudates and non-exudates, an artificial neural network classifier was investigated.\nThe proposed system can achieve a diagnostic accuracy with 95.0% sensitivity and 88.9% specificity for the identification of images containing any evidence of retinopathy, where the trade off between sensitivity and specificity was appropriately balanced for this particular problem. Furthermore, it demonstrates 93.0% sensitivity and 94.1% specificity in terms of exudate based classification.\nThis study indicates that automated evaluation of digital retinal images could be used to screen for exudative diabetic retinopathy.","authors":["Alireza Osareh","M Mirmehdi","B Thomas","R Markham"],"meta":["November 2003The British journal of ophthalmology 87(10):1220-3","DOI:10.1136/bjo.87.10.1220","SourcePubMed"],"references":["14230671_Automatic_detection_of_diabetic_retinopathy_using_an_artificial_neural_network_A_screening_tool","12885182_Automated_localization_of_the_optic_disc_fovea_and_retinal_blood_vessels_from_digital_color_fundus_images","220929783_Comparison_of_Colour_Spaces_for_Optic_Disc_Localisation_in_Retinal_Images","200033861_Neural_Networks_for_Pattern_Recognition","14894019_Assessing_Test_Accuracy_and_its_Clinical_Consequences_A_Primer_for_Receiver_Operating_Characteristic_Curve_Analysis"]}
