{"id":"354463639_A_Literature_Review_of_Music_in_Computer_Science_The_forthcoming_issue_at_International_Journal_of_Computing_and_Digital_Systems_ISSN_2210-142X","abstract":"Music has been a big part of human life since ancient civilizations and listening to music is fun and besides for the benefit of humans themselves. Over time, computer science continues to develop and music begins to be recorded digitally and belongs to the group of unstructured data whose data needs to be managed so that it becomes structured data. Much academic work has analyzed how music is digitized and there is also mixed analysis of the negative effects of music, but most research agrees that digitization has many positive effects in terms of the computer science-backed world of music. A large number of papers analyze what people think about the use of technology in music education and several have proposed several different ideas that can be applied. This paper analyzes and reviews papers that discuss the application of computer science technology that plays a role in managing digital music data, which is better known in the form of sound or sound. The literature review in this paper is carried out in 4 steps, namely paper collection, selective screening, classification, and summary analysis. The literature review discussed in this paper is divided into three parts, namely the rise of digital music, how computer science can be integrated into music education, and music creation through computer science.","authors":["Harco Leslie Hendric Spits Warnars","Winston Rusli"],"meta":["July 2021","Project: Mood Classification  on Keroncong Music Computationally"],"references":["341079457_Computational_Music_Thinking_Patterns_Connecting_Music_Education_with_Computer_Science_Education_through_the_Design_of_Interactive_Notations","333507541_Technology_Use_and_Attitudes_in_Music_Learning","329314752_Languages_for_Computer_Music","328772153_Predicting_Moral_Disengagement_from_the_Harms_associated_with_Digital_Music_Piracy_An_Exploratory_Integrative_Test_of_Digital_Drift_and_the_Criminal_Interaction_Order","327804503_Sensoring_a_Generative_System_to_Create_User-Controlled_Melodies","326819638_Contestability_in_the_Digital_Music_Player_Market","326313296_JythonMusic_An_Environment_for_Developing_Interactive_Music_Systems","337848057_Scratch_and_Google_Blockly_How_Girls'_Programming_Skills_and_Attitudes_are_Influenced","336786715_A_Paradigm_for_Teaching_Math_and_Computer_Science_Concepts_in_K-12_Learning_Environment_by_Integrating_Coding_Animation_Dance_Music_and_Art","329748772_SISTEM_PENDUKUNG_KEPUTUSAN_DALAM_MEREKOMENDASIKAN_TEMPAT_LES_MUSIK_DIPEMATANGSIANTAR_MENGGUNAKAN_METODE_MULTIFACTOR_EVALUATION_PROCESS_MFEP","326097966_Music_Technology_and_the_Hip_Hop_Beat_Making_Tradition_A_History_and_Typology_of_Equipment_for_Music_Therapy","324532300_On_the_Origin_of_Music","320738136_Discovering_Spotify_-_A_Thematic_Introduction","324708540_BlockyTalky_New_programmable_tools_to_enable_students'_learning_networks","320671109_Visual_Programming_Language_for_Model_Checkers_Based_on_Google_Blockly"]}
