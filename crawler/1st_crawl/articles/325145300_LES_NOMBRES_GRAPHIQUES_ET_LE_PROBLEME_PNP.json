{"id":"325145300_LES_NOMBRES_GRAPHIQUES_ET_LE_PROBLEME_PNP","abstract":"I will prove the existence of a function f n with values in ℕ on any Graph G/ {X 1 ,… , X n } with cardinal n , such that either f n (X 1) is equal to 0 or it is the sum of all hamiltonian cycles. The number of the operations to be performed to calculate f n (X 1) is of the order O(n 3) and that it follows that we have P=NP.
