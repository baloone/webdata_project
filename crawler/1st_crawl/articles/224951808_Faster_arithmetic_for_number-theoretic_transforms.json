{"id":"224951808_Faster_arithmetic_for_number-theoretic_transforms","abstract":"We show how to improve the efficiency of the computation of fast Fourier\ntransforms over F_p where p is a word-sized prime. Our main technique is\noptimisation of the basic arithmetic, in effect decreasing the total number of\nreductions modulo p, by making use of a redundant representation for integers\nmodulo p. We give performance results showing a significant improvement over\nShoup's NTL library.","authors":["David Harvey"],"meta":["May 2012Journal of Symbolic Computation 60","DOI:10.1016/j.jsc.2013.09.002","SourcearXiv"],"references":["255588377_Number_Theory_Meets_Cache_Locality_-_Efficient_Implementation_of_a_Small_Prime_FFT_for_the_GNU_Multiple_Precision_Arithmetic_Library","220266669_Finite_field_linear_algebra_subroutines","264945958_Modern_Computer_Algebra","243119758_Modular_Multiplication_Without_Trial_Division","242622843_NTL_A_library_for_doing_number_theory","220555963_Modern_computer_algebra","220330099_Improved_Division_by_Invariant_Integers","51992169_Instruction_tables_Lists_of_instruction_latencies_throughputs_and_microoperation_breakdowns_for_Intel_AMD_and_VIA_CPUs"]}
