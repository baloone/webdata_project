{"id":"283531736_Efficient_community_detection_of_network_flows_for_varying_Markov_times_and_bipartite_networks","abstract":"Community detection of network flows conventionally assumes one-step dynamics\non the links. For sparse networks and interest in large-scale structures,\nlonger timescales may be more appropriate. Oppositely, for large networks and\ninterest in small-scale structures, shorter timescales may be better. However,\ncurrent methods for analyzing networks at different timescales require\nexpensive and often infeasible network reconstructions. To overcome this\nproblem, we introduce a method that takes advantage of the inner-workings of\nthe map equation and evades the reconstruction step. This makes it possible to\nefficiently analyze large networks at different Markov times with no extra\noverhead cost. The method also evades the costly unipartite projection for\nidentifying flow modules in bipartite networks.","authors":["Masoumeh Kheirkhahzadeh","Andrea Lancichinetti","Martin Rosvall"],"meta":["November 2015PHYSICAL REVIEW E 93(3)","DOI:10.1103/PhysRevE.93.032309","SourcearXiv"],"references":["281144883_Hierarchical_mutual_information_for_the_comparison_of_hierarchical_community_structures_in_complex_networks","272422849_Random_Walks_Markov_Processes_and_the_Multiscale_Modular_Organization_of_Complex_Networks","257836726_Hierarchical_Block_Structures_and_High-Resolution_Model_Selection_in_Large_Networks","51935964_Compression_of_Flow_Can_Reveal_Overlapping-Module_Organization_inNetworks","288268599_Bell_system_tech","245583550_Bell_System_Technical_Journal","220573606_Min-Wise_Independent_Permutations","51993442_A_Mathematical_Theory_of_Communication"]}
