{"id":"352702535_Academic_Collaboration_Recommendation_for_Computer_Science_Researchers_Using_Social_Network_Analysis","abstract":"In order to improve the quality and quantity of the performance in computing in Nigeria Universities, there is need for a functioning research networking application through which they can exchange ideas. This is because academics tend to be more comfortable communicating with each other, asking questions and more importantly, such networking will provide mentorship in the Nigeria academic community. In order to make for this, several recommendations have been suggested but not scientific. Therefore to bridge this gap, this paper examines the properties of co-authorship network in Covenant University, Computer Science department. Properties of network such as centrality measures, network coefficient and so on are discovered. A collaboration recommendation application is then developed using the link prediction based on the Adamic-Adar Index measure. In conclusion, the result gotten from the network analysis is a valuable source of information for accessing the different centrality values of researchers in computer science. It also formed the foundation for developing an academic collaboration recommendation system for a small world research network. This will therefore improve the quantity and quality of performance of computer science academics in Nigeria.","authors":["Afolabi Ibukun","Atinuke Ayo","Oluwole Odetunmibi"],"meta":["November 2021Wireless Personal Communications 121(1)","DOI:10.1007/s11277-021-08646-2"],"references":["330651673_The_Wide_Margin_Between_the_Academic_and_Researcher_in_a_New_Age_University_for_Sustainable_Development","324105065_Research_impact_in_co-authorship_networks_a_two-mode_analysis","306353453_Research_impact_in_co-authorship_structures_a_two-mode_analysis","281653687_Link_Prediction_Methods_and_Their_Accuracy_for_Different_Social_Networks_and_Network_Metrics","264287644_Influence_of_co-authorship_networks_in_the_research_impact_Ego_network_analyses_from_Microsoft_Academic_Search","326401991_Social_Network_Analysis_for_Social_Risks_of_Construction_Projects_in_High-Density_Urban_Areas_in_China","323727440_Career-training_mentorship_intervention_via_the_Dreyfus_model_Implication_for_career_behaviors_and_practical_skills_acquisition_in_vocational_electronic_technology","308084205_Sport_communication_research_A_social_network_analysis","260012021_Stakeholder-Associated_Risks_and_their_Interactions_in_Complex_Green_Building_Projects_A_Social_Network_Model","259095731_Co-authorship_networks_and_research_impact_A_social_capital_perspective","258651970_Scientific_Co-authorship_Social_Networks_A_Case_Study_of_Computer_Science_Scenario_in_India","249963543_Connecting_and_cooperating_social_capital_and_public_policy","248519014_An_Information_Flow_Model_for_Conflict_and_Fission_in_Small_Groups1","247220383_Pragmatism_and_self-organization","229318458_Structural_Investigation_of_Supply_Networks_A_Social_Network_Analysis_Approach"]}
