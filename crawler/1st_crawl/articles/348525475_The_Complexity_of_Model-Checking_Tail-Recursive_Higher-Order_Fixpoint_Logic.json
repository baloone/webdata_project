{"id":"348525475_The_Complexity_of_Model-Checking_Tail-Recursive_Higher-Order_Fixpoint_Logic","abstract":"Higher-Order Fixpoint Logic (HFL) is a modal specification language whose expressive power reaches far beyond that of Monadic Second-Order Logic, achieved through an incorporation of a typed λ-calculus into the modal μ-calculus. Its model checking problem on finite transition systems is decidable, albeit of high complexity, namely k-EXPTIME-complete for formulas that use functions of type order at most k < 0. In this paper we present a fragment with a presumably easier model checking problem. We show that so-called tail-recursive formulas of type order k can be model checked in (k − 1)-EXPSPACE, and also give matching lower bounds. This yields generic results for the complexity of bisimulation-invariant non-regular properties, as these can typically be defined in HFL.","authors":["Florian Bruse","Martin Lange","Étienne Lozes"],"meta":["January 2021Fundamenta Informaticae 178(1-2):1-30","DOI:10.3233/FI-2021-1996"],"references":["224107211_Hierarchies_of_Memory_Limited_Computations","266304770_On_the_computational_complexity_of_algorithms","265239568_Temporal_Logics_Beyond_Regularity","222668328_Propositional_dynamic_logic_of_context-free_programs_and_fixpoint_logic_with_chop","222645366_Model_checking_propositional_dynamic_logic_with_all_extras","222479972_Bisimulation-invariant_PTIME_and_higher-dimensional_m-calculus","222460749_Propositional_Dynamic_Logic_of_Nonregular_Programs","222384214_Uniform_inevitability_is_tree_automation_ineffable","222216339_Relationships_between_nondeterministic_and_deterministic_tape_complexities","220896827_Results_on_the_Propositional_m-Calculus"]}
