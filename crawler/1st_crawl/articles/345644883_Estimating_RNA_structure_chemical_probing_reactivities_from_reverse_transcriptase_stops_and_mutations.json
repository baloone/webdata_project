{"id":"345644883_Estimating_RNA_structure_chemical_probing_reactivities_from_reverse_transcriptase_stops_and_mutations","abstract":"Chemical probing experiments interrogate RNA structures by creating covalent adducts on RNA molecules in structure-dependent patterns. Adduct positions are then detected through conversion of the modified RNAs into complementary DNA (cDNA) by reverse transcription (RT) as either stops (RT-stops) or mutations (RT-mutations). Statistical analysis of the frequencies of RT-stops and RT-mutations can then be used to estimate a measure of chemical probing reactivity at each nucleotide of an RNA, which reveals properties of the underlying RNA structure. Inspired by recent work that showed that different reverse transcriptase enzymes show distinct biases for detecting adducts as either RT-stops or RT-mutations, here we use a statistical modeling framework to derive an equation for chemical probing reactivity using experimental signatures from both RT-stops and RT-mutations within a single experiment. The resulting formula intuitively matches the expected result from considering reactivity to be defined as the fraction of adduct observed at each position in an RNA at the end of a chemical probing experiment. We discuss assumptions and implementation of the model, as well as ways in which the model may be experimentally validated.","authors":["Angela M Yu","Molly E. Evans","Julius B.
