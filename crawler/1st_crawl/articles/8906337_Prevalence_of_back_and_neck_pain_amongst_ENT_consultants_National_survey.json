{"id":"8906337_Prevalence_of_back_and_neck_pain_amongst_ENT_consultants_National_survey","abstract":"Back and neck pain is an established occupational disease for many professions. No previous studies have shown the association of back and neck pain with ENT surgery. Our objective was to determine the prevalence of neck and back pain in ENT consultants in the United Kingdom and which sub-specialties were most at risk. A national survey from 325 ENT consultants in the UK revealed that 72 per cent had either back pain or neck pain or even both. Of those with pain 53 per cent attributed their symptoms directly to ENT surgery. Highest figures were received from otologists, related to microscope work and prolonged sitting. The importance of these findings has demonstrated the lack of awareness and adequate training to prevent long-term disability in ENT surgeons.","authors":["Humera Babar-Craig","Graham Banfield","J Knight"],"meta":["January 2004The Journal of Laryngology & Otology 117(12):979-82","DOI:10.1258/002221503322683885","SourcePubMed"],"references":["21846674_Lower_back_pain_in_physicians_Epidemiological_aspect_and_risk_factors","223929152_Survey_of_neuromuscular_injuries_to_the_patient_and_surgeon_during_urologic_laparoscopic_surgery","18927799_Disc_degeneration_Its_frequency_and_relationship_to_symptoms","16750464_Epidemiology_and_Impact_of_Low-Back_Pain","13754371_Epidemiology_of_occupational_low_back_pain","13226169_Prevalence_of_low_back_pain_in_the_population"]}
