{"id":"330132537_Unlucky_Cohorts_Estimating_the_Long-Term_Effects_of_Entering_the_Labor_Market_in_a_Recession_in_Large_Cross-Sectional_Data_Sets","abstract":"This paper studies the differential persistent effects of initial economic conditions for labor market entrants in the United States from 1976 to 2015 by education, gender, and race using labor force survey data. We find persistent earnings and wage reductions, especially for less advantaged entrants, that increases in government support only partly offset. We confirm that the results are unaffected by selective migration and labor market entry by also using a double-weighted average unemployment rate at labor market entry for each birth cohort and state-of-birth cell based on average state migration rates and average cohort education rates from census data.","authors":["Hannes Schwandt","Till von Wachter"],"meta":["January 2019Journal of Labor Economics 37(S1):S161-S198","DOI:10.1086/701046"],"references":["318889998_Scraping_by_Income_and_Program_Participation_After_the_Loss_of_Extended_Unemployment_Benefits_Extended_Unemployment_Benefits"]}
