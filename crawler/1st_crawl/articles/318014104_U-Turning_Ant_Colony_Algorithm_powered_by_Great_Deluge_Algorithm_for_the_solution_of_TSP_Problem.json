{"id":"318014104_U-Turning_Ant_Colony_Algorithm_powered_by_Great_Deluge_Algorithm_for_the_solution_of_TSP_Problem","abstract":"In latest years, Optimization Algorithms have been one of the most interesting \napplications that can be used in order to solve tough real life problems. Real life \nproblems could be either single or multi objective. In general Optimization \ntechniques try to minimize an objective function for any real life problem. One of the \nmost interesting real life problems is Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) that is NP\nhard which cannot be solved straightforwardly. Swarm Intelligence that is a field of \nArtificial Intelligence, uses the behaviors of real swarms to solve Optimization \nproblems. Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), \nand Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm (ABC) are the well-known Swarm Intelligence \nalgorithms that are generally used in solving NP-hard problems. \nIn this thesis, TSP problems are solved by using ACO algorithm which uses the \nbehavior of real ants. For the betterment of the solutions found by ACO, a local \nsearch, Greate Deluge Algorithm (GDA) is used, also a new type of Ant defined as \nU-Turning Ant (UAnt) which returns back without completing its route guides the \nremainders in finding the shortest route. In this thesis it is shown that by hybridizing \nACO with local search and using U-Turning Ants in ACO (U-TACO), the solutions \nof the given TSP problems will be improved. \nKeywords: Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), \nGreat Deluge Algorithm (GDA), and U-Turning Ant Colony Algorithm (U-TACO).","authors":["Saman M.
