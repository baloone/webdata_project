{"id":"271387782_An_cal_On2_logn_algorithm_for_the_weighted_stable_set_problem_in_claw-free_graphs","abstract":"A claw-free graph $G(V, E)$ is said to be basic if there exists a matching $M\n\\subseteq E$ whose edges are strongly bisimplicial and such that each connected\ncomponent $C$ of $G - M$ is either a clique or a {claw, net}-free graph or\nsatisfies $\\alpha(G[C \\setminus V(M)]) \\le 3$. The Maximum Weight Stable Set\n(MWSS) Problem in a basic claw-free graph can be easily solved by first solving\nat most four MWSS problems in each connected component of $G - M$ in ${\\cal\nO}(|V|^2 \\log(|V|))$ time (\\cite{NobiliSassano15a,NobiliSassano15b}) and then\nsolving the MWSS Problem on a suitable line graph constructed from $G$ in\n${\\cal O}(|V|^2 \\log(|V|))$ time. In this paper we show that, by means of\nlifting operations, every claw-free graph $G(V, E)$ can be transformed, in\n${\\cal O}(|V|^2)$ time, into a basic claw-free graph $\\bar G(\\bar V, \\bar E)$\nsuch that $|\\bar V| = {\\cal O}(|V|)$ and a MWSS of $G$ can be obtained from a\nMWSS of $\\bar G$. This shows that the complexity of solving the MWSS Problem in\na claw-free graph $G(V, E)$ is ${\\cal O}(|V|^2 \\log(|V|))$, the same as in line\ngraphs.","authors":["Paolo Nobili","Antonio Sassano"],"meta":["January 2015Mathematical Programming 186(4)","DOI:10.1007/s10107-019-01461-5","SourcearXiv"],"references":["271387972_An_cal_Onsqrtm_algorithm_for_the_weighted_stable_set_problem_in_claw_net-free_graphs_with_alphaG_ge_4","230595717_Combinatorial_Optimization_Polyhedra_and_Efficiency","344709727_The_structure_of_claw-free_graphs","313002179_The_structure_of_claw-free_graphs","274478796_Solving_the_Weighted_Stable_Set_Problem_in_Claw-Free_Graphs_via_Decomposition","256935687_A_Strengthening_of_Ben_Rebea's_Lemma","229754985_An_analysis_of_alternate_strategies_for_implementing_matching_algorithms","221394825_A_reduction_algorithm_for_the_weighted_stable_set_problem_in_claw-free_graphs","220994642_Pruning_Graphs_with_Digital_Search_Trees_Application_to_Distance_Hereditary_Graphs","220780456_Data_Structures_for_Weighted_Matching_and_Nearest_Common_Ancestors_with_Linking"]}
