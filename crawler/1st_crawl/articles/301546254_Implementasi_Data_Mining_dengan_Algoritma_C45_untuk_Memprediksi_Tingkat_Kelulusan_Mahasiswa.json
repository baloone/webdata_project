The data of graduated students from each academic year is an important part as a source of information to make a decision for BAAK (Bureau of Academic and Student Administration). With this information, a prediction can be made for students who are still active whether they can graduate on time, fast, late or drop out with the implementation of data mining. The purpose of this study is to make a prediction of studentsâ€™ graduation with C4.5 algorithm as a reference for making policies and actions of academic fields (BAAK) in reducing students who graduated late and did not pass. From the research, the category of IPS semester one to semester six, gender, origin of high school, and number of credits, can predict the graduation of students with conditions quickly pass, pass on time, pass late and drop out, using data mining with C4.5 algorithm. Category of semester six is the highly influential on the predicted outcome of graduation. With the application test result, accuracy of the graduation prediction acquired is 87.5%.","authors":["david hartanto kamagi","Seng Hansun"],"meta":["June 2014Jurnal ULTIMATICS 6(1):15","DOI:10.31937/ti.v6i1.327"],"references":["221900819_Discovering_Knowledge_in_Data_An_Introduction_to_Data_Mining","220688795_Data_Mining_Concepts_and_Techniques"]}
