{"id":"353504187_Scale-bridging_Microstructural_Analysis_-_A_Correlative_Approach_to_Microstructure_Quantification_Combining_Microscopic_Images_and_EBSD_Data","abstract":"A comprehensive description of complex material structures may require characterization using different methods and observations across several scales. This work will present a correlative approach including light optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and electron backscatter diffraction, enabling microstructure quantification which combines microscopic images and electron backscatter diffraction data. The parameters obtained from electron backscatter diffraction such as misorientation parameters or grain and phase boundary data are an ideal source of information, complementing microscopic images. Two case studies performed on bainitic microstructures will be presented to demonstrate practical applications of this approach.","authors":["M. Müller","D. Britz","F.
