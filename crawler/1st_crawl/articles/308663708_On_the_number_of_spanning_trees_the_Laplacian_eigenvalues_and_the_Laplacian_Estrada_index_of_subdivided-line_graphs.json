In this paper we obtain a closed-form formula for the enumeration of spanning trees in ?(G), employing the theory of electrical networks. We present bounds for the largest and second smallest Laplacian eigenvalues of ?(G) in terms of the maximum degree, the number of edges, and the first Zagreb index of G. In addition, we establish upper and lower bounds for the Laplacian Estrada index of ?(G) based on the vertex degrees of G. These bounds are also connected with the number of spanning trees in ?(G).","authors":["Yilun Shang"],"meta":["May 2016Open Mathematics 14(1)","DOI:10.1515/math-2016-0055"],"references":["299366101_Counting_spanning_trees_in_prism_and_anti-prism_graphs","283103707_Estrada_and_L-Estrada_Indices_of_Edge-Independent_Random_Graphs","277971486_Enumeration_of_spanning_trees_on_generalized_pseudofractal_networks","277637207_Laplacian_Estrada_and_Normalized_Laplacian_Estrada_Indices_of_Evolving_Graphs","268711093_Diameters_of_iterated_clique_graphs","266981675_Note_on_Estrada_and_L-Estrada_indices_of_graphs","280329610_A_formula_for_the_number_of_the_spanning_trees_of_line_graphs","273204991_Some_Results_on_Laplacian_Estrada_Index_of_Graphs","268996328_Eigenvalues_of_the_Laplacian_of_a_Graph","268020670_Structural_Properties_of_Subdivided-Line_Graphs"]}
