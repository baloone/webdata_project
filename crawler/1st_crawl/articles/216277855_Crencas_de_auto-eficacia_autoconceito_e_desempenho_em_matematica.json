The subjects comprised 122 third and fourth graders, both male and female, whose ages varied from eight to thirteen, attending a state public school in an inner city in the state of São Paulo. Data were collected using a mathematical self-efficacy questionnaire, a mathematical self-concept scale, and a mathematics test. To investigate correlations among variables, a Pearson correlation test was conducted. The results indicated that student performance was positively related to self-concept and mathematical self-efficacy. In addition, a significant, positive relationship could be seen between the beliefs of mathematical self-concept and mathematical self-efficacy. The results of the present study, in general terms, bear out other research data on the same theme, as well as theoretical assumptions from a socio-cognitive perspective.","authors":["SOUZA","Liliane Neves Inglez de Souza","BRITO","Márcia Regina Ferreira de"],"meta":["June 2008Estudos de Psicologia (Campinas) Vol 25(2):193-201","DOI:10.1590/S0103-166X2008000200004"],"references":["269462101_Self-Concept_Validation_of_Construct_Interpretations","254345630_Role_of_Mathematics_Self-Efficacy_and_Motivation_in_Mathematics_Performance_Across_Ethnicity","247852538_Criancas_com_dificuldades_escolares_atendidas_em_programa_de_suporte_psicopedagico_na_escola_Avaliacao_de_autoconceito","243768420_An_Exploration_of_the_Mathematics_Self-EfficacyMathematics_Performance_Correspondence","232500178_Change_in_Children's_Competence_Beliefs_and_Subjective_Task_Values_Across_the_Elementary_School_Years_A_3-Year_Study","26370049_Autoconceito_de_criancas_com_dificuldades_de_aprendizagem_e_problemas_de_comportamento","26362185_A_auto-eficacia_e_os_aspectos_comportamentais_de_criancas_com_dificuldade_de_aprendizagem","314298961_The_relationship_between_student_team_learning_outcomes_and_achievement_causal_attributions_and_affect","312894519_The_dynamic_self-concept_A_social_psychological_perspective","280780584_Relation_of_self-efficacy_expectations_to_academic_achievement_and_persistence","280696810_Against_the_odds_Self-efficacy_beliefs_of_women_in_mathematical_scientific_and_technological_careers","249037342_Mathematics_Self-Efficacy_Ethnic_Identity_Gender_and_Career_Interests_Related_to_Mathematics_and_Science","247409609_Effects_of_Math_Self-Concept_Perceived_Self-Efficacy_and_Attributions_for_Failure_and_Success_on_Test_Anxiety","239060654_Self-Efficacy_Beliefs_in_Academic_Settings","234837355_The_Dynamic_Self-Concept_A_Social_Psychological_Perspective","233896451_Perceived_Self-Efficacy_in_Cognitive_Development_and_Functioning","232603513_Role_of_Self-Efficacy_and_Self-Concept_Beliefs_in_Mathematical_Problem_Solving_A_Path_Analysis","232551751_Relation_of_self-efficacy_to_academic_achievement_and_persistence","232530532_The_Relationship_Among_Self-Concept_Self-Efficacy_and_Performance_in_Mathematics_During_Secondary_School","232502510_Role_of_Mathematics_Self-Efficacy_in_the_Structural_Model_of_Mathematics_Achievement","232456905_The_Relationship_Between_Student_Team_Learning_Outcomes_and_Achievement_Causal_Attributions_and_Affect","232455764_Interacting_effects_of_goal_setting_and_self-_or_other-referenced_feedback_on_children's_development_of_self-efficacy_and_cognitive_skill_within_the_Taiwanese_classroom","227641527_Self-Efficacy_Beliefs_as_Shapers_of_Children's_Aspirations_and_Career_Trajectories","225251442_Contextual_Differences_in_Student_Motivation_and_Self-Regulated_Learning_in_Mathematics_English_and_Social_Studies_Classrooms","38138741_Self-Concept_Attributional_Beliefs_and_School_Achievement_A_Longitudinal_Analysis","21746336_Association_of_Attitude_toward_Mathematics_with_Self-Efficacy_Causal_Attribution_and_Personality_Traits","14227953_Self-Efficacy_Beliefs_and_Mathematical_Problem-Solving_of_Gifted_Students","13912052_The_effect_of_social_comparison_on_mathematics_self-concept","12181655_Social_Cognitive_Theory_An_Agentic_Perspective","2371438_Against_The_Odds_Self-Efficacy_Beliefs_Of_Women_In_Mathematical_Scientific_And_Technological_Careers"]}
