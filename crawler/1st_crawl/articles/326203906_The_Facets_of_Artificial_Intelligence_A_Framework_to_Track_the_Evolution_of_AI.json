{"id":"326203906_The_Facets_of_Artificial_Intelligence_A_Framework_to_Track_the_Evolution_of_AI","abstract":"We present nine facets for the analysis of the past and future evolution of AI. Each facet has also a set of edges that can summarise different trends and contours in AI. With them, we first conduct a quantitative analysis using the information from two decades of AAAI/IJCAI conferences and around 50 years of documents from AI topics, an official database from the AAAI, illustrated by several plots. We then perform a qualitative analysis using the facets and edges, locating AI systems in the intelligence landscape and the discipline as a whole. This analytical framework provides a more structured and systematic way of looking at the shape and boundaries of AI.","authors":["Fernando Martínez Plumed","Bao Sheng Loe","Peter A.
