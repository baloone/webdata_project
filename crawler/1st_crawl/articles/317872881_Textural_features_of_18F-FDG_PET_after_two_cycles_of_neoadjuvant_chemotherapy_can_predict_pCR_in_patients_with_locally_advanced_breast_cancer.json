Changes to imaging parameters [maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), metabolic tumor volume (MTV), total lesion glycolysis (TLG)] and textural features (entropy, coarseness, skewness) between the 2 scans were measured by two independent radiologists. Pathological responses were reviewed by one pathologist, and the significance of the predictive value of each parameter was analyzed using a Chi-squared test. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to compare the area under the curve (AUC) for each parameter.\n\nResults: \npCR was observed more often in patients with HER2-positive tumors (22 patients) than in patients with HER2-negative tumors (5 patients) (71.0 vs. 16.7%, p < 0.001). ∆ %SUVmax, ∆ %entropy and ∆ %coarseness were significantly useful for differentiating pCR from non-pCR in the HER2-negative group, and the AUCs for these parameters were 0.928, 0.808 and 0.800, respectively (p = 0.003, 0.032 and 0.037). In the HER2-positive group, ∆ %SUVmax and ∆ %skewness were moderately useful for predicting pCR, and the respective AUCs were 0.747 and 0.758 (p = 0.033 and 0.026). Although there was no significant difference in the AUCs between groups for these parameters, an additional 3/22 patients in the HER2-positive group with pCR were identified when ∆ %skewness and ∆ %SUVmax were considered together (p = 0.031). The absolute values for each parameter before NAC and after 2 cycles cannot predict pCR in our patients. Neither ∆ %MTV nor ∆ %TLG was efficiently predictive of pCR in any group.\n\nConclusions: \nThe early changes in the textural features of (18)F-FDG PET images after two cycles of NAC are predictive of pCR in both HER2-negative and HER2-positive patients; this evidence warrants confirmation by further research.","authors":["Lin Cheng","Jian-Ping Zhang","Yujie Wang","Xiaoping Xu"],"meta":["June 2017Annals of Nuclear Medicine 31(24)","DOI:10.1007/s12149-017-1184-1"],"references":["313590361_Correlation_between_tumour_characteristics_SUV_measurements_metabolic_tumour_volume_TLG_and_textural_features_assessed_with_18F-FDG_PET_in_a_large_cohort_of_oestrogen_receptor-positive_breast_cancer_p","306049829_Trastuzumab_improves_locoregional_control_in_HER2-positive_breast_cancer_patients_following_adjuvant_radiotherapy","304187144_Early_Change_in_Metabolic_Tumor_Heterogeneity_during_Chemoradiotherapy_and_Its_Prognostic_Value_for_Patients_with_Locally_Advanced_Non-Small_Cell_Lung_Cancer","275525667_Early_Metabolic_Response_to_Neoadjuvant_Treatment_FDG_PETCT_Criteria_according_to_Breast_Cancer_Subtype","261603813_Relationship_between_Tumor_Heterogeneity_Measured_on_FDG-PETCT_and_Pathological_Prognostic_Factors_in_Invasive_Breast_Cancer","260950365_HER2-positive_breast_cancer_F-18-FDG_PET_for_early_prediction_of_response_to_trastuzumab_plus_taxane-based_neoadjuvant_chemotherapy","257393072_Response_to_trastuzumab_by_HER2_expressing_breast_tumour_xenografts_is_accompanied_by_decreased_Hexokinase_II_glut1_and_18F-FDG_incorporation_and_changes_in_31P-NMR-detectable_phosphomonoesters","257350939_18F-FDG_PETCT_for_early_prediction_of_response_to_neoadjuvant_lapatinib_trastuzumab_and_their_combination_in_HER2-positive_breast_cancer_Results_from_neo-ALTTO","255177282_Locally_Advanced_Squamous_Cell_Carcinoma_of_the_Head_and_Neck_CT_Texture_and_Histogram_Analysis_Allow_Independent_Prediction_of_Overall_Survival_in_Patients_Treated_with_Induction_Chemotherapy","233418467_Assessment_of_Primary_Colorectal_Cancer_Heterogeneity_by_Using_Whole-Tumor_Texture_Analysis_Contrast-enhanced_CT_Texture_as_a_Biomarker_of_5-year_Survival","49836263_Intratumor_Heterogeneity_Characterized_by_Textural_Features_on_Baseline_F-18-FDG_PET_Images_Predicts_Response_to_Concomitant_Radiochemotherapy_in_Esophageal_Cancer","41399031_Cancerous_Breast_Lesions_on_Dynamic_Contrast-enhanced_MR_Images_Computerized_Characterization_for_Image-based_Prognostic_Markers","9073745_Tumor_Treatment_Response_Based_on_Visual_and_Quantitative_Changes_in_Global_Tumor_Glycolysis_Using_PET-FDG_Imaging_The_Visual_Response_Score_and_the_Change_in_Total_Lesion_Glycolysis","3040355_Texture_Analysis_of_Aggressive_and_Nonaggressive_Lung_Tumor_CE_CT_Images","314019419_Effect_of_preoperative_chemotherapy_on_the_outcome_of_women_with_operable_breast_cancer","314015951_Effect_of_preoperative_chemotherapy_on_local-regional_disease_in_women_with_operable_breast_cancer_findings_from_National_Surgical_Adjuvant_Breast_and_Bowel_Project_B-18","290976857_Neoadjuvant_as_Future_for_Drug_Development_in_Breast_Cancer--Response","282041109_Early_prediction_of_response_to_neoadjuvant_chemotherapy_in_breast_cancer_patients_comparison_of_single-voxel_1H-magnetic_resonance_spectroscopy_and_18F-fluorodeoxyglucose_positron_emission_tomography","280115458_Neoadjuvant_Therapy_in_Breast_Cancer_as_a_Basis_for_Drug_Approval","279726787_Do_clinical_histological_or_immunohistochemical_primary_tumour_characteristics_translate_into_different_18F-FDG_PETCT_volumetric_and_heterogeneity_features_in_stage_IIIII_breast_cancer","264632679_Texture_analysis_on_18F-FDG_PETCT_images_to_differentiate_malignant_and_benign_bone_and_soft-tissue_lesions","258828639_The_Effect_of_Small_Tumor_Volumes_on_Studies_of_Intratumoral_Heterogeneity_of_Tracer_Uptake","233914552_Texture_analysis_in_assessment_and_prediction_of_chemotherapy_response_in_breast_cancer","232811533_Diagnostic_performance_of_fluorodeoxyglucose-positron_emission_tomographycomputed_tomography_combined_with_ultrasonography-guided_fine_needle_aspiration_cytology_for_identifying_axillary_lymph_node_st","232741176_Three-dimensional_positron_emission_tomography_image_texture_analysis_of_esophageal_squamous_cell_carcinoma_Relationship_between_tumor_18F-fluorodeoxyglucose_uptake_heterogeneity_maximum_standardized_","51813124_Combined_PETCT_image_characteristics_for_radiotherapy_tumor_response_in_lung_cancer","49824028_Rousseau_C_Devillers_A_Campone_M_Campion_L_Ferrer_L_Sagan_C_Ricaud_M_Bridji_B_Kraeber-Bodere_FFDG_PET_evaluation_of_early_axillary_lymph_node_response_to_neoadjuvant_chemotherapy_in_stage_II_and_III_b","47509760_Hypoxia_and_Hypoxia-Inducible_Factors_Master_Regulators_of_Metastasis","26886677_Pre-therapy_18F-FDG_PET_quantitative_parameters_help_in_predicting_the_response_to_radioimmunotherapy_in_non-Hodgkin_lymphoma","26744604_Automated_Radiation_Targeting_in_Head-and-Neck_Cancer_Using_Region-Based_Texture_Analysis_of_PET_and_CT_Images","20061543_ROC_Methodology_in_Radiologic_Imaging","8169923_Texture_analysis_of_medical_images"]}
