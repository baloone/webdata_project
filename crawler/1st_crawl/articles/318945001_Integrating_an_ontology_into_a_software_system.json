{"id":"318945001_Integrating_an_ontology_into_a_software_system","abstract":"Ontologies are recognized as formal knowledge representations facilitating sharing, interoperability, and cooperation between people and heterogeneous systems. However, several questions remain unanswered in relation to ontology usage in real world software systems, such as how to achieve their concrete integration in software systems and to what extent are they really beneficial to these systems?\nThe aim of this paper is twofold. On one hand, we propose a generic approach that integrates an ontology into a software system and on the other hand we demonstrate its feasibility and usefulness by carrying out a real world case study; namely, a competency location system for a computer science school.","authors":["Leila Zemmouchi-Ghomari","Abdessamed RÃ©da Ghomari","Lamia Adjir","Lynda Belaala"],"meta":["July 2017Journal of Systems Integration 8(3):27-39","DOI:10.20470/jsi.v8i3.306","Projects: ConferenceDatabases and OntologiesBMO added value"],"references":["265227991_From_Class_Diagrams_to_Relational_Tables_A_Graph_Transformation-based_Approach","262677609_Identification_of_Ontologies_to_support_information_Systems_development","256297018_Bringing_Relational_Databases_into_the_Semantic_Web_A_Survey","251332115_Ontologies_versus_relational_databases_Are_they_so_different_A_comparison","243772462_Ontology_Development_101_A_Guide_to_Creating_Your_First_Ontology","288175535_Understanding_the_benefits_of_ontology_use_for_Australian_industry_A_conceptual_study","286061335_How_ontologies_benefit_enterprise_applications","278706024_The_Ontop_Framework_for_Ontology_Based_Data_Access","277917105_How_to_measure_business_value_of_business_model_ontologies_A_proposal","244437488_A_Translation_Approach_to_Portable_Ontology_Specifications"]}
