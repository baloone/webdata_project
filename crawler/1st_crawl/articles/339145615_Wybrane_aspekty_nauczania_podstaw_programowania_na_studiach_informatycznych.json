These subjects are believed to be the most difficult during the whole curriculum by students and academic teachers as well. Students must acquire a series of abilities related with problem solving and knowing the syntax of some programming language. The complexity of this process implies challenges for teaching methods.","authors":["Magdalena Andrzejewska"],"meta":["December 2016"],"references":["259998409_Visual_Program_Simulation_in_Introductory_Programming_Education","243464895_Increasing_student_commitment_in_introductory_programming_learning","237524669_PROBLEMS_IN_LEARNING_AND_TEACHING_PROGRAMMING_-_a_literature_study_for_developing_visualizations_in_the_Codewitz-Minerva_project","237436516_Collaborative_Learning_Environment_to_Improve_Novice_Programmer_with_Convincing_Opinions","234800767_A_Multi-National_Study_of_Reading_and_Tracing_Skills_in_Novice_Programmers","228328491_Learning_to_program_-_difficulties_and_solutions","222408325_The_effectiveness_of_pair_programming_A_meta-analysis","314828921_A_multi-national_multi-institutional_study_of_assessment_of_programming_skills_of_first-year_CS_students","274289652_Learning_by_mistakes_in_teaching_programming_through_distance_learning","223344321_Pair_programming_productivity_Novice-novice_vs_expert-expert","31597406_A_Survey_of_Literature_on_the_Teaching_of_Introductory_Programming","200085837_Learning_and_Teaching_Programming_A_Review_and_Discussion"]}
