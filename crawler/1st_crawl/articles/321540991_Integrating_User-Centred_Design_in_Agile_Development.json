{"id":"321540991_Integrating_User-Centred_Design_in_Agile_Development","abstract":"This book examines the possibilities of incorporating elements of user-centred design (UCD) such as user experience (UX) and usability with agile software development. It explores the difficulties and problems inherent in integrating these two practices despite their relative similarities, such as their emphasis on stakeholder collaboration.\nDeveloped from a workshop held at NordiCHI in 2014, this edited volume brings together researchers from across the software development, UCD and creative design fields to discuss the current state-of-the-art. Practical case studies of integrating UCD in Agile development across diverse contexts are presented, whilst the different futures for UCD and other design practices in the context of agile software development are identified and explored.\nIntegrating User Centred Design in Agile Development will be ideal for researchers, designers and academics who are interested in software development, user-centred design, agile methodologies and related areas.","authors":["Gilbert Cockton","Marta Larusdottir","Peggy Gregory","Ã…sa Cajander"],"meta":["January 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-32165-3","ISBN: 978-3-319-32163-9","Project: The Agile & UCD Project"],"references":[]}
