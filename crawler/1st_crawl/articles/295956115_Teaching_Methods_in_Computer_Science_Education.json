{"id":"295956115_Teaching_Methods_in_Computer_Science_Education","abstract":"This chapter presents active-learning-based teaching methods that computer science educators can employ in the classroom. The purpose of this chapter is first, to let the students in the MTCS course experience a variety of teaching methods before becoming computer science teachers; second, to discuss, together with the students, the advantages and disadvantages of these teaching methods; and third, to demonstrate high school teaching situations in which it is appropriate to employ these teaching methods. Within this chapter we discuss (a) pedagogical tools: games, the CS-Unplugged approach, rich tasks, concept maps, classification, and metaphors; (b) different forms of class organization; and (c) mentoring software project development.","authors":["Orit Hazzan","Tami Lapidot","Noa Ragonis"],"meta":["March 2011","DOI:10.1007/978-0-85729-443-2_7","In book: Guide to Teaching Computer Science (pp.91-118)"],"references":["228363728_Problem-Based_Learning_for_Foundation_Computer_Science_Courses","226849466_Learning_Technological_Concepts_and_Developing_Intellectual_Skills","215439441_The_Theory_Underlying_Concept_Maps_and_How_to_Construct_Them","3782584_Project-based_learning_practices_in_computer_science_education","318494453_Metaphors_We_Live_By","317953634_The_one_and_the_many","285970744_Motivation_project-based_learning_Sustaining_the_doing_supporting_the_learning","255567517_Challenges_in_Mentoring_Software_Development_Projects_in_the_High_School_Analysis_According_to_Shulman's_Teacher_Knowledge_Base_Model","254002578_Mind_the_Gender_gap_Can_a_two-hour_visit_to_a_hi-tech_company_change_perceptions_about_computer_science","247954973_The_Probe_Method_A_Project-Based-Learning_Model's_effect_on_Critical_Thinking_Skills","243782229_Inquiry_in_Project-Based_Science_Classrooms_Initial_Attempts_by_Middle_School_Students","243767764_Teaching_Children_Science_A_Project-Based_Approach","238162544_A_Review_of_Research_on_Project-Based_Learning","237130873_Motivating_project-based_learning_Sustaining_the_doing","234645356_Project-based_Learning_Moving_Students_through_the_GED_with_Meaningful_Learning","232543390_Motivating_Project-Based_Learning_Sustaining_the_Doing_Supporting_the_Learning","228328575_Pair_Programming_Illuminated","226500165_Majoring_in_Technology_Studies_at_High_School_and_Fostering_Learning","37688084_Metaphors_We_Live_by"]}
