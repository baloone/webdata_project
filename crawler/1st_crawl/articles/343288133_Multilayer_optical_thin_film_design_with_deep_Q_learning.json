{"id":"343288133_Multilayer_optical_thin_film_design_with_deep_Q_learning","abstract":"Multilayer optical film plays a significant role in broad fields of optical application. Due to the nonlinear relationship between the dispersion characteristics of optical materials and the actual performance parameters of optical thin films, it is challenging to optimize optical thin film structure with the traditional models. In this paper, we present an implementation of Deep Q-learning, which suited for the most part for optical thin film. As a set of concrete demonstrations, we optimize solar absorber. The optimal program could optimal this solar absorber in 500 epoch (about 200 steps per-epoch) without any human intervention. Search results perform better than researchersâ€™ manual searches.","authors":["Jiang an qing","Osamu Yoshie","Liangyao Chen"],"meta":["July 2020Scientific Reports 10(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-020-69754-w"],"references":["339364232_Deep_learning_enabled_inverse_design_in_nanophotonics","335186526_Accurate_and_instant_frequency_estimation_from_noisy_sinusoidal_waves_by_deep_learning","325519480_Nanophotonic_Particle_Simulation_and_Inverse_Design_Using_Artificial_Neural_Networks","320473480_Mastering_the_game_of_Go_without_human_knowledge","314092106_Deep_Learning_for_Design_and_Retrieval_of_Nano-photonic_Structures","338321965_Design_of_high_transmission_color_filters_for_solar_cells_directed_by_deep_Q-learning","331204157_Optimisation_of_colour_generation_from_dielectric_nanostructures_using_reinforcement_learning","325495436_Deep_learning_for_the_design_of_nano-photonic_structures","320413251_Training_Deep_Neural_Networks_for_the_Inverse_Design_of_Nanophotonic_Structures","272837232_Human-level_control_through_deep_reinforcement_learning"]}
