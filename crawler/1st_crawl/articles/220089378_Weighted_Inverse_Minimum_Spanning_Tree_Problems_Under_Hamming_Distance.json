{"id":"220089378_Weighted_Inverse_Minimum_Spanning_Tree_Problems_Under_Hamming_Distance","abstract":"In this paper, we consider weighted inverse minimum spanning tree problems under Hamming distance. Three models are considered: unbounded case, unbounded case with forbidden edges, and general bounded case. In terms of the method for minimum-weight node cover problem on bipartite graph, we present their respective strongly polynomial algorithms.","authors":["Yong He","Zhang Binwu","Enyu Yao"],"meta":["February 2005Journal of Combinatorial Optimization 9(1):91-100","DOI:10.1007/s10878-005-5486-1","SourceDBLP"],"references":["250889978_An_algorithm_for_inverse_minimum_spanning_tree_problem","238757128_Lecture_notes_on_approximation_algorithms","230596652_Solving_Inverse_Spanning_Tree_Problems_Through_Network_Flow_Techniques","226022867_On_the_inverse_problem_of_minimum_spanning_tree_with_partition_constraints","220690835_Network_Flows_Theory_Algorithms_and_Applications","220089375_Solution_Structure_of_Some_Inverse_Combinatorial_Optimization_Problems","220089254_Inverse_Combinatorial_Optimization_A_Survey_on_Problems_Methods_and_Results","220089153_A_General_Model_of_Some_Inverse_Combinatorial_Optimization_Problems_and_Its_Solution_Method_Under_l_Norm","2484847_A_Faster_Algorithm_for_the_Inverse_Spanning_Tree_Problem","2364870_Inverse_Optimization_A_Survey_on_Problems_Methods_and_Results"]}
