{"id":"320303413_Implementing_Open_Call-by-Value","abstract":"The theory of the call-by-value \\(\\lambda \\)-calculus relies on weak evaluation and closed terms, that are natural hypotheses in the study of programming languages. To model proof assistants, however, strong evaluation and open terms are required. Open call-by-value is the intermediate setting of weak evaluation with open terms, on top of which Gr√©goire and Leroy designed the abstract machine of Coq. This paper provides a theory of abstract machines for open call-by-value. The literature contains machines that are either simple but inefficient, as they have an exponential overhead, or efficient but heavy, as they rely on a labelling of environments and a technical optimization. We introduce a machine that is simple and efficient: it does not use labels and it implements open call-by-value within a bilinear overhead. Moreover, we provide a new fine understanding of how different optimizations impact on the complexity of the overhead.","authors":["Beniamino Accattoli","Giulio Guerrieri"],"meta":["October 2017","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-68972-2_1","Conference: International Conference on Fundamentals of Software Engineering"],"references":["313096485_Implementing_Open_Call-by-Value_Extended_Version","281487133_A_Strong_Distillery","263012272_Distilling_Abstract_Machines_Long_Version","228107036_The_Parametric_lambda-Calculus_a_Metamodel_for_Computation","226473916_Derivational_Complexity_Is_an_Invariant_Cost_Model","222426616_WRS_2008_New_Developments_in_Environment_Machines","221351029_Lambda_Calculi_and_Linear_Speedups","221241347_A_Compiled_Implementation_of_Strong_Reduction","220676840_Deriving_a_Lazy_Abstract_Machine","220404275_Sequent_Calculi_and_Abstract_Machines","213879117_Improving_the_lazy_Krivine_machine","24374398_On_Constructor_Rewrite_Systems_and_the_Lambda-Calculus_Long_Version","312025481_The_Complexity_of_Abstract_Machines","308730809_On_the_Relative_Usefulness_of_Fireballs","307564236_Open_Call-by-Value","305908655_The_Useful_MAM_a_Reasonable_Implementation_of_the_Strong_lambda_-Calculus","285906234_On_the_Value_of_Variables","276295899_On_the_Relative_Usefulness_of_Fireballs","266660564_Distilling_Abstract_Machines","266659033_Beta_Reduction_is_Invariant_Indeed","262393532_Deriving_the_full-reducing_Krivine_machine_from_the_small-step_operational_semantics_of_normal_order","262270408_A_synthetic_operational_account_of_call-by-need_evaluation","222120495_Call-by-name_call-by-value_and_the_l-calculus","221252265_An_Abstract_Machine_for_Lambda-Terms_Normalization","220606992_On_the_correctness_of_the_Krivine_machine","220248522_Full_Abstraction_in_the_Lazy_Lambda_Calculus","2639066_A_Provable_Time_and_Space_Efficient_Implementation_of_NESL"]}
