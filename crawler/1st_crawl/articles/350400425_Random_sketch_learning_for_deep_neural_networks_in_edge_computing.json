{"id":"350400425_Random_sketch_learning_for_deep_neural_networks_in_edge_computing","abstract":"Despite the great potential of deep neural networks (DNNs), they require massive weights and huge computational resources, creating a vast gap when deploying artificial intelligence at low-cost edge devices. Current lightweight DNNs, achieved by high-dimensional space pre-training and post-compression, present challenges when covering the resources deficit, making tiny artificial intelligence hard to be implemented. Here we report an architecture named random sketch learning, or Rosler, for computationally efficient tiny artificial intelligence. We build a universal compressing-while-training framework that directly learns a compact model and, most importantly, enables computationally efficient on-device learning. As validated on different models and datasets, it attains substantial memory reduction of ~50–90× (16-bits quantization), compared with fully connected DNNs. We demonstrate it on low-cost hardware, whereby the computation is accelerated by >180× and the energy consumption is reduced by ~10×. Our method paves the way for deploying tiny artificial intelligence in many scientific and industrial applications.","authors":["Bin Li","Peijun Chen","Hongfu Liu","Weisi Guo"],"meta":["March 2021Nature Computational Science 1(3):221-228","DOI:10.1038/s43588-021-00039-6"],"references":["349182298_Deep_Reinforcement_Learning_for_Autonomous_Driving_A_Survey","342790679_A_mobile_robotic_chemist","335788783_Wireless_Network_Intelligence_at_the_Edge","331565122_Federated_Learning_in_Distributed_Medical_Databases_Meta-Analysis_of_Large-Scale_Subcortical_Brain_Data","349553906_The_lottery_ticket_hypothesis_Finding_sparse_trainable_neural_networks","343732846_Low-Latency_Federated_Learning_and_Blockchain_for_Edge_Association_in_Digital_Twin_Empowered_6G_Networks","342139703_Randomized_Approximate_Channel_Estimator_in_Massive-MIMO_Communication","337109555_PruneTrain_fast_neural_network_training_by_dynamic_sparse_model_reconfiguration","331089977_Deep_learning_and_process_understanding_for_data-driven_Earth_system_science","330695411_Federated_Machine_Learning_Concept_and_Applications","324571573_Scaling_for_edge_inference_of_deep_neural_networks","321492168_Analogue_signal_and_image_processing_with_large_memristor_crossbars","330423568_Working_on_the_edge","322433623_Federated_learning_of_predictive_models_from_federated_Electronic_Health_Records","322325843_Deep_Learning_for_Smart_Manufacturing_Methods_and_Applications"]}
