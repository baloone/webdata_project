{"id":"3749674_Caging_planar_objects_with_a_three-finger_one-parameter_gripper","abstract":"This paper extends the caging theory of Rimon and Blake (1996) for\none-parameter two-finger grippers to one-parameter three-finger\ngrippers. The caging theory describes how the fingers of a robot gripper\ncan be placed around an object so that it cannot escape. As the fingers\nclose from such a configuration, the freedom of the object to move is\ngradually restricted, until, in the absence of friction, it is\ncompletely immobilized by the fingers at an immobilizing grasp. The\nextension of the caging theory to three-fingered grippers is important\nbecause convex objects cannot be caged by two-finger grippers. The\ncomputation of the set of caging formations requires the identification\nof both the two- and three-finger frictionless grasps. These grasps\ncorrespond to critical points of the opening parameter in the gripper's\nconfiguration space. There are two main problems here. Firstly, a method\nis needed to compute the critical points of the opening parameter in the\nthree-finger contact space. This is complicated by the fact that this\nspace may have more that one connected component. The second problem is\nhow to associate the immobilizing grasps with punctures. In this paper\nwe solve both these problems, presenting efficient algorithmic solutions","authors":["C. Davidson","A.
