{"id":"280773582_Non-commutative_Edmonds'_problem_and_matrix_semi-invariants","abstract":"In 1967, Edmonds introduced the problem of computing the rank over the\nrational function field of an $n\\times n$ matrix $T$ with integral homogeneous\nlinear polynomials. In this paper, we consider the non-commutative version of\nEdmonds' problem: compute the rank of $T$ over the free skew field. It is known\nthat this problem relates to the ring of matrix semi-invariants. In particular,\nif the nullcone of matrix semi-invariants is defined by elements of degree\n$\\leq \\sigma$, then there follows a $\\mathrm{poly}(n, \\sigma)$-time randomized\nalgorithm to decide whether the non-commutative rank of $T$ is $<n$. To our\nknowledge, previously the best bound for $\\sigma$ was $O(n^2\\cdot 4^{n^2})$\nover algebraically closed fields of characteristic $0$ (Derksen, 2001).\nIn this article we prove the following results:\n(1) We observe that by using an algorithm of Gurvits, and assuming the above\nbound $\\sigma$ for $R(n, m)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$, deciding whether $T$ has\nnon-commutative rank $<n$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ can be done deterministically in\ntime polynomial in the input size and $\\sigma$.\n(2) When $\\mathbb{F}$ is large enough, we devise a deterministic algorithm\nfor non-commutative Edmonds' problem in time polynomial in $(n+1)!$, with the\nfollowing consequences.\n(2.a) If the commutative rank and the non-commutative rank of $T$ differ by a\nconstant, then there exists a randomized efficient algorithm that computes the\nnon-commutative rank of $T$.\n(2.b) We prove that $\\sigma\\leq (n+1)!$. This not only improves the bound\nobtained from Derksen's work over algebraically closed field of characteristic\n$0$ but, more importantly, also provides for the first time an explicit bound\non $\\sigma$ for matrix semi-invariants over fields of positive characteristics.","authors":["GÃ¡bor Ivanyos","Youming Qiao","Venkata Subrahmanyam"],"meta":["September 2017computational complexity 26(3)","DOI:10.1007/s00037-016-0143-x","SourcearXiv"],"references":["280873010_On_generating_the_ring_of_matrix_semi-invariants","346675793_Polynomial_bounds_for_rings_of_invariants","346671638_Skew_Fields_Theory_of_General_Division_Rings","321017654_Non-commutative_arithmetic_circuits_with_division","319759263_Uber_die_vollen_Invariantensysteme","280033798_On_vanishing_of_Kronecker_coefficients","279957852_Graduate_Texts_in_Mathematics","268017964_Associative_Algebras","267334617_Free_Rings_and_their_Relations","266214938_Finite_generating_system_of_matrix_invariants"]}
