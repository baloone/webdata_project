{"id":"330544850_Convex_polygon_triangulation_based_on_planted_trivalent_binary_tree_and_ballot_problem","abstract":"This paper presents a new technique of generation of convex polygon triangulation based on planted trivalent binary tree and ballot notation. The properties of the Catalan numbers were examined and their decomposition and application in developing the hierarchy and triangulation trees were analyzed. The method of storage and processing of triangulation was constructed on the basis of movements through the polygon. This method was derived from vertices and leaves of the planted trivalent binary tree. The research subject of the paper is analysis and comparison of a constructed method for solving of convex polygon triangulation problem with other methods and generating graphical representation. The application code of the algorithms was done in the Java programming language.","authors":["Muzafer H.
