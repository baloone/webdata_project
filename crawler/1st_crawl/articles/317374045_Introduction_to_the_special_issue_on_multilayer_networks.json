{"id":"317374045_Introduction_to_the_special_issue_on_multilayer_networks","abstract":"During the last century, networks of several types have been used to model a wide range of physical, biological and social systems. For example, Moreno (1934) studied social networks with multiple types of ties, later called multiplex networks (Verbrugge, 1979; Minor, 1983; Lazega & Pattison, 1999) as well as networks with multiple types of actors. Networks with multiple types of actors and relational ties have often been used together: relevant examples are the extensions of two-mode networks studied by Wasserman & Iacobucci (1991), multi-level networks (Lazega & Snijders, 2016), and heterogeneous information networks (Sun et al., 2012). More recently, researchers in physics and computer science have developed models for different types of interconnected networks known as networks of networks (Buldyrev et al., 2010; D'Agostino & Scala, 2014), multilayer social networks (Magnani & Rossi, 2011), and interconnected networks (Dickison et al., 2012).","authors":["MATTEO MAGNANI","Stan Wasserman"],"meta":["June 2017Network Science 5(02):141-143","DOI:10.1017/nws.2017.15"],"references":["270730281_Multiplexity_in_Adult_Friendships","257142871_Multilayer_Networks","227724377_Statistical_modeling_of_one-mode_and_two-mode_networks_Simultaneous_analysis_of_graphs_and_bipartite_graphs","316181928_Multilevel_Network_Analysis_for_the_Social_Sciences_Theory_Methods_and_Applications","291338426_Role_Sets_and_Division_of_Work_at_Two_Levels_of_Collective_Agency_The_Case_of_Blockmodeling_a_Multilevel_Inter-individual_and_Inter-organizational_Network","291294945_Who_shall_survive_A_new_approach_to_the_problem_of_human_interrelations","279228002_Mining_Heterogeneous_Information_Networks_Principles_and_Methodologies","259786331_Networks_of_Networks_The_Last_Frontier_of_Complexity","232548298_Who_shall_survive_A_new_approach_to_the_problem_of_human_interrelations_Nervous_and_mental_disease_monograph_series_no_58","223330498_Multiplexity_Generalized_Exchange_and_Cooperation_in_Organizations_A_Case_Study"]}
