{"id":"230808467_Nanomedicine_Nanotechnology_in_surgery","abstract":"Nanomedicine is the application of nanotechnology to the medical field. Nanotechnology deals with structures in the range of 1–100 nm and focuses on the development\nof materials with novel properties. As a result it is considered as a key technology of the twenty-first century and promises to deliver innovative methods to medicine in general\nand to surgery in particular. Clinical studies will deal with nanotechnology-based cancer treatment and innovative nanocontainers for targeted drug delivery and more efficient\ntreatment. Nanotechnology will start a new era in medicine which will offer sophisticated methods for diagnosis, therapy and prevention. These tools will be a challenge to efficient\neducation and training of surgeons.","authors":["Simone Elke Hieber","Bert Müller"],"meta":["January 2011Der MKG-Chirurg 1:7-15"],"references":[]}
