{"id":"319281232_Enhancing_CIDOC-CRM_and_compatible_models_with_the_concept_of_multiple_interpretation","abstract":"Modelling cultural heritage and archaeological objects is used as much for management as for research purposes. To ensure the sustainable benefit of digital data, models benefit from taking the data specificities of historical and archaeological domains into account. Starting from a conceptual model tailored to storing these specificities, we present, in this paper, an extended mapping to CIDOC-CRM and its compatible models. Offering an ideal framework to structure and highlight the best modelling practices, these ontologies are essentially dedicated to storing semantic data which provides information about cultural heritage objects. Based on this standard, our proposal focuses on multiple interpretation and sequential reality.","authors":["Muriel Van Ruymbeke","Pierre Hallot","Roland Billen"],"meta":["August 2017","DOI:10.5194/isprs-annals-IV-2-W2-287-2017"],"references":["308944041_Expressing_reliability_with_CIDOC_CRM","306327468_Harmonizing_the_CRMba_and_CRMarchaeo_models","306089508_CRMgeo_A_spatiotemporal_extension_of_CIDOC-CRM","305628507_Process_concept_or_thing_Some_initial_considerations_in_the_ontological_modelling_of_architecture","303041230_Enhancing_Spatio-Temporal_Identity_States_of_Existence_and_Presence","281574232_Semantically_Documenting_Virtual_Reconstruction_Building_a_Path_to_Knowledge_Provenance","275209717_TOWARDS_AN_ARCHAEOLOGICAL_INFORMATION_SYSTEM_IMPROVING_THE_CORE_DATA_MODELTOWARDS_AN_ARCHAEOLOGICAL_INFORMATION_SYSTEM_IMPROVING_THE_CORE_DATA_MODEL","273650229_VIRTUAL_LEODIUM_FROM_AN_HISTORICAL_3D_CITY_SCALE_MODEL_TO_AN_ARCHAEOLOGICAL_INFORMATION_SYSTEM","300413332_Building_an_argumentation_platform_for_3D_reconstruction_using_CIDOC-CRM_and_Drupal","282537765_CRMba_a_CRM_extension_for_the_documentation_of_standing_buildings"]}
