Compressed sensing reconstructions on 1 knee and 2 brain data sets were compared with fully sampled data sets and reconstruction errors were measured. Sampling coherence was evaluated on the undersampling patterns to investigate whether there was a relation between this coherence measure and reconstruction error.Second, we investigated whether data-driven undersampling methods could improve reconstruction quality when 1 or more fully sampled scans are available as a training set. We implemented 3 different data-driven undersampling methods: (1) Monte Carlo optimization of variable density and variable density Poisson disk undersampling, (2) calculating sampling probabilities directly from the k-space power spectra of the training data, and (3) iterative design of undersampling patterns based on CS reconstruction errors in k-space.Two cross-validation experiments were set up using retrospective undersampling to evaluate the 3 data-driven methods and the influence of the size of the training set. Furthermore, in an experiment that included prospective under sampling, we show the practical applicability of 2 of the data-driven methods. Compressed sensing reconstruction quality was measured with both the normalized root-mean-square error metric and the mean structural similarity index measure.\n\nResults: \nDifferent optimal variable sampling densities were found for each of the data sets, showing that the optimal sampling density is data dependent. Choosing a sampling density other than the optimal density decreased reconstruction quality. These results suggest that choosing a sampling density without having any reference scans is likely suboptimal. Furthermore, no meaningful correlation was found between sampling coherence and reconstruction error.For the data-driven methods, the iterative method yielded statistically significantly higher reconstruction quality in both retrospective and prospective experiments. In retrospective experiments, the power spectrum method yielded a reconstruction quality that was comparable with the data-driven variable density method. The size of the training set had only a minor influence on the reconstruction quality.\n\nConclusions: \nData-driven undersampling methods can be used to avoid suboptimal reconstruction quality in CS magnetic resonance imaging, provided that at least 1 fully sampled scan is available to train the data-driven method. The iterative design method resulted in the highest reconstruction quality.","authors":["Frank Zijlstra","Max A Viergever","Peter R Seevinck"],"meta":["December 2015Investigative Radiology 51(6)","DOI:10.1097/RLI.0000000000000231"],"references":["220124333_The_Split_Bregman_Method_for_L1-Regularized_Problems","209634070_Iterative_thresholding_compressed_sensing_MRI_based_on_contourlet_transform","49735273_Adapted_Random_Sampling_Patterns_for_Accelerated_MRI","30765385_Fast_Discrete_Curvelet_Transforms","3327793_Image_Quality_Assessment_From_Error_Visibility_to_Structural_Similarity","312771295_Image_quality_assessment_From_error_visibility_to_structural_similarity","301822646_The_Split_Bregman_method_for_L1_regularized_problems","287383164_The_wavelet_transform_time-frequency_localization_and_signal_analysis","274650633_Algorithm_AS_89_The_Upper_Tail_Probabilities_of_Spearman's_Rho","265053584_Reducing_view-sharing_using_compressed_sensing_in_time-resolved_contrast-enhanced_magnetic_resonance_angiography","244482270_Robust_abdominal_imaging_with_incomplete_breath-holds","236643659_ESPIRiT-an_eigenvalue_approach_to_autocalibrating_parallel_MRI_where_SENSE_meets_GRAPPA","236090309_Clinical_Image_Quality_Assessment_of_Accelerated_Magnetic_Resonance_Neuroimaging_Using_Compressed_Sensing","235386838_Under-sampling_trajectory_design_for_compressed_sensing_MRI","224241197_Practical_parallel_imaging_compressed_sensing_MRI_Summary_of_two_years_of_experience_in_accelerating_body_MRI_of_pediatric_patients","222693842_Compressed_Sensing_with_Coherent_and_Redundant_Dictionaries","221757028_Adaptive_sampling_design_for_compressed_sensing_MRI","220124383_A_Fast_Iterative_Shrinkage-Thresholding_Algorithm_for_Linear_Inverse_Problems","50866552_Fast_high_resolution_whole_brain_T2_weighted_imaging_using_echo_planar_imaging_at_7_T","45390722_SPIRiT_Iterative_Self-consistent_Parallel_Imaging_Reconstruction_From_Arbitrary_k-Space","45271418_Compressed_sensing_of_remotely_detected_MRI_velocimetry_in_microfluidics","44689159_Compressed_Sensing_Reconstruction_for_Magnetic_Resonance_Parameter_Mapping","44655744_Improved_Pediatric_MR_Imaging_with_Compressed_Sensing1","43051661_Compressed_sensing_in_hyperpolarized_3_He_Lung_MRI","40694537_3D_Compressed_Sensing_for_Highly_Accelerated_Hyperpolarized_C-13_MRSI_With_In_Vivo_Applications_to_Transgenic_Mouse_Models_of_Cancer","38098781_Elastix_A_Toolbox_for_Intensity-Based_Medical_Image_Registration","38039211_B_Optimization_of_k-space_trajectories_for_compressed_sensing_by_Bayesian_experimental_design","11491193_Self-calibrating_parallel_imaging_with_automatic_coil_sensitivity_extraction","5877310_Sparse_MRI_The_application_of_compressed_sensing_for_rapid_MR_imaging","3086165_Near-Optimal_Signal_Recovery_From_Random_Projections_Universal_Encoding_Strategies","3077656_The_wavelet_transform_time-frequency_localization_and_signal_analysis"]}
