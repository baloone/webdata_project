{"id":"323701103_A_Low-Cost_Maximum_Power_Point_Tracking_System_Based_on_Neural_Network_Inverse_Model_Controller","abstract":"This work presents the design, modeling, and implementation of a neural network inverse model controller for tracking the maximum power point of a photovoltaic (PV) module. A nonlinear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs (NARX) was implemented in a serial-parallel architecture. The PV module mathematical modeling was developed, a buck converter was designed to operate in the continuous conduction mode with a switching frequency of 20 KHz, and the dynamic neural controller was designed using the Neural Network Toolbox from Matlab/Simulink (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA), and it was implemented on an open-hardware Arduino Mega board. To obtain the reference signals for the NARX and determine the 65 W PV module behavior, a system made of a 0.8 W PV cell, a temperature sensor, a voltage sensor and a static neural network, was used. To evaluate performance a comparison with the P&O traditional algorithm was done in terms of response time and oscillations around the operating point. Simulation results demonstrated the superiority of neural controller over the P&O. Implementation results showed that approximately the same power is obtained with both controllers, but the P&O controller presents oscillations between 7 W and 10 W, in contrast to the inverse controller, which had oscillations between 1 W and 2 W.","authors":["Carlos Robles","Deimer Sevilla","Diego Andr√©s Restrepo Leal"],"meta":["January 2018Electronics 7(1)","DOI:10.3390/electronics7010004","Project: Sistemas de Control Inteligente"],"references":["323701254_Fuzzy_logic_based_MPPT_controller_for_a_PV_system","323701243_Low-Cost_Fuzzy_Logic_Control_for_Greenhouse_Environments_with_Web_Monitoring","315666507_Dual-Axis_Solar_Tracker_for_Using_in_Photovoltaic_Systems","349766679_A_new_MPPT_controller_based_on_the_Ant_Colony_Optimization_Algorithm_for_Photovoltaic_Systems_under_Partial_Shading_Conditions","315465688_Neuro-Fuzzy_Wavelet_Based_Adaptive_MPPT_Algorithm_for_Photovoltaic_Systems","313630883_A_New_Fuzzy_MPPT_Scheme_Based_on_a_Novel_Tuning_Routine","308740189_A_New_Variable_Step_Size_Neural_Networks_MPPT_Controller_Review_Simulation_and_Hardware_Implementation","306420616_Maximum_power_point_tracking_using_a_variable_antecedent_fuzzy_logic_controller","306012815_A_novel_hybrid_Maximum_Power_Point_Tracking_Technique_using_Perturb_Observe_algorithm_and_Learning_Automata_for_solar_PV_system","305829786_Comparative_performance_analysis_between_static_solar_panels_and_single-axis_tracking_system_on_a_hot_climate_region_near_to_the_equator"]}
