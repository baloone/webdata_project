{"id":"23492048_The_development_of_a_Patients_Concerns_Inventory_PCI_to_help_reveal_patients_concerns_in_the_head_and_neck_clinic","abstract":"The purpose of the Patients Concerns Inventory (PCI) is to identify the concerns that patients would like to discuss during their consultation. The PCI covers a range of issues including hearing, intimacy, fatigue, financial/benefits, PEG tube, relationships, regret, support for family, and wound healing. It also lists MDT members that patients would like to see or be referred on to. The PCI is completed using a touch-screen computer (TST) immediately before consultation. Responses are networked into the consultation room. A 28 weeks pilot for one consultant ran from August 2007 with 123 (of maximum 150) patients. The median time to complete the TST was 8min. Patients most frequently selected fear of recurrence (37%), dental health/teeth (27%), chewing (24%), pain in head/neck (20%), fatigue/tiredness (19%), saliva (18%) and swallowing (18%). The two MDT members they wished to see were dentist (19%) and speech/language therapist (10%). The vast majority felt the PCI made a difference (quite a bit/very much) to their consultation as it made it 'a bit more personal', 'reminds them of the points they want discussed', 'allows the consultation to get straight to the point'. Although the PCI can raise many issues it did not noticeably prolong the consultation (median 8min with PCI, 7min without PCI). The Patients Concerns Inventory (PCI) helps focus the consultation onto patient needs and promotes multidisciplinary care. Following this very successful pilot the PCI is being rolled out to other consultants in the H & N clinic.","authors":["Simon N Rogers","J El-Sheikha","D Lowe"],"meta":["December 2008Oral Oncology 45(7):555-61","DOI:10.1016/j.oraloncology.2008.09.004","SourcePubMed"],"references":["11504850_Computer-based_quality_of_life_questionnaires_may_contribute_to_doctor-patient_interactions_in_oncology","8608230_Clinical_Predictors_of_Quality_of_Life_in_Patients_With_Head_and_Neck_Cancer","24311218_Screening_for_dysfunction_to_promote_MDT_intervention_using_the_University_of_Washington_Quality_of_Life_questionnaire_UW-QOL","14046300_Computerized_quality-of-life_screening_in_an_oncology_clinic","12821384_Psychologic_response_of_the_edentulous_patient_after_primary_surgery_for_oral_cancer_A_cross-sectional_study","12336383_How_Are_You_Feeling_Who_Wants_To_Know_Patients'_and_Oncologists'_Preferences_for_Discussing_Health-Related_Quality-of-Life_Issues","11265175_The_addition_of_mood_and_anxiety_domains_to_the_University_of_Washington_Quality_of_Life_Scale","8692128_Measuring_Quality_of_Life_in_Routine_Oncology_Practice_Improves_Communication_and_Patient_Well-Being_A_Randomized_Controlled_Trial","7530886_Facial_appearance_after_operations_for_oral_and_oropharyngeal_cancer_A_comparison_of_casenotes_and_patient-completed_questionnaire","7504512_Health-related_quality_of_life_measured_by_the_UW-QoL_-_Reference_values_from_a_general_dental_practice","7084505_A_feasibility_study_of_computer-assisted_health-related_quality_of_life_data_collection_in_patients_with_oral_and_oropharyngeal_cancer","6875283_Patients'_views_on_the_utility_of_quality_of_life_questionnaires_in_head_and_neck_cancer_A_randomised_trial","6404812_A_systematic_review_of_patient-reported_outcome_measures_in_head_and_neck_cancer_surgery","6236320_A_structured_review_and_theme_analysis_of_papers_published_on_'quality_of_life'_in_head_and_neck_cancer_2000-2005","5549114_The_patients'_account_of_outcome_following_primary_surgery_for_oral_and_oropharyngeal_cancer_using_a_'quality_of_life'_questionnaire","5422705_Touch_screen_computer-assisted_health-related_quality_of_life_and_distress_data_collection_in_head_and_neck_cancer_patients"]}
