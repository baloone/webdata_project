{"id":"314258522_Near-Optimal_Closeness_Testing_of_Discrete_Histogram_Distributions","abstract":"We investigate the problem of testing the equivalence between two discrete histograms. A {\\em $k$-histogram} over $[n]$ is a probability distribution that is piecewise constant over some set of $k$ intervals over $[n]$. Histograms have been extensively studied in computer science and statistics. Given a set of samples from two $k$-histogram distributions $p, q$ over $[n]$, we want to distinguish (with high probability) between the cases that $p = q$ and $\\|p-q\\|_1 \\geq \\epsilon$. The main contribution of this paper is a new algorithm for this testing problem and a nearly matching information-theoretic lower bound. Specifically, the sample complexity of our algorithm matches our lower bound up to a logarithmic factor, improving on previous work by polynomial factors in the relevant parameters. Our algorithmic approach applies in a more general setting and yields improved sample upper bounds for testing closeness of other structured distributions as well.","authors":["Ilias Diakonikolas","Daniel Kane","Vladimir Nikishkin"],"meta":["March 2017"],"references":["312077212_Sample-Optimal_Density_Estimation_in_Nearly-Linear_Time","305322080_Fast_Algorithms_for_Segmented_Regression","344477911_Testing_Statistical_Hypotheses","324286365_Multivariate_Density_Estimation_Theory_Practice_and_Visualization","322471811_On_optimal_and_data-based_histograms","321018084_Learning_k-modal_distributions_via_testing","312238022_A_New_Approach_for_Testing_Properties_of_Discrete_Distributions","310122560_Collision-based_Testers_are_Optimal_for_Uniformity_and_Closeness","308814715_Optimal_Algorithms_and_Lower_Bounds_for_Testing_Closeness_of_Structured_Distributions","304021404_Are_Few_Bins_Enough_Testing_Histogram_Distributions"]}
