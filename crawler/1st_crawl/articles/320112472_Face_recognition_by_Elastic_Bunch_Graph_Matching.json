{"id":"320112472_Face_recognition_by_Elastic_Bunch_Graph_Matching","abstract":"We present a system for recognizing human faces from single images out of a large database containing one image per person. Faces are represented by labeled graphs, based on a Gabor wavelet transform. Image graphs of new faces are extracted by an elastic graph matching process and can be compared by a simple similarity function. The system differs from the preceding one in three respects. Phase information is used for accurate node positioning. Object-adapted graphs are used to handle large rotations in depth. Image graph extraction is based on a novel data structure, the bunch graph, which is constructed from a small set of sample image graphs.","authors":["Laurenz Wiskott","Jean-Marc Fellous","Norbert Kr√ºger","Christoph von der Malsburg"],"meta":["July 1997","DOI:10.1109/34.598235","Project: 1993 - 1995 : Face Processing with Elastic Bunch Graph Matching"],"references":[]}
