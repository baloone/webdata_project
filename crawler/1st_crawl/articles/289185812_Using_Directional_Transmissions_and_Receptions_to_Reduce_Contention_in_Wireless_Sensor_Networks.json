{"id":"289185812_Using_Directional_Transmissions_and_Receptions_to_Reduce_Contention_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","abstract":"Electronically Switched Directional (ESD) antennas allow software-based control of the direction of maximum antenna gain. ESD antennas are feasible for wireless sensor network. Existing studies with these antennas focus only on controllable directional transmissions. These studies demonstrate reduced contention and increased range of communication with no energy penalty. Unlike existing literature, in this chapter we experimentally explore controllable antenna directionality at both sender and receiver. One key outcome of our experiments is that directional transmissions and receptions together considerably reduce channel contention. As a result, we can significantly reduce intra-path interference.","authors":["Ambuj Varshney","Thiemo Voigt","Luca Mottola"],"meta":["December 2014Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering 281:205-213","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-03071-5-21"],"references":["221091625_Electronics_Flush_A_Reliable_Bulk_Transport_Protocol_for_Multihop_Wireless_Networks","4299150_Exploiting_Low-Cost_Directional_Antennas_in_24_GHz_IEEE_802154_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","279637356_Directional_Antennas_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","261168793_Electronically-switched_directional_antennas_for_wireless_sensor_networks_A_full-stack_evaluation","258433128_Antenna_Theory_Analysis_and_Design","254006271_Strawman_Resolving_collisions_in_bursty_low-power_wireless_networks","224731724_The_Capture_Effect_in_FM_Receivers","221462065_Evaluation_of_an_Electronically_Switched_Directional_Antenna_for_Real-World_Low-Power_Wireless_Networks","221091694_The_b-factor_Measuring_wireless_link_burstiness","221091327_PIP_a_connection-oriented_multi-hop_multi-channel_TDMA-based_MAC_for_high_throughput_bulk_transfer","2409654_A_Transmission_Control_Scheme_for_Media_Access_in_Sensor_Networks"]}
