{"id":"283088924_Certain_Types_of_Product_Bipolar_Fuzzy_Graphs","abstract":"Recently, bipolar fuzzy graph is a vastly growing research area as it is the generalization of the fuzzy graphs. In this paper, at first the concepts of regular and totally regular product bipolar fuzzy graphs is introduced. Then necessary and sufficient conditions are established under which regular and totally regular product\nbipolar fuzzy graph becomes equivalent. The notion of product bipolar fuzzy line graph is introduced and investigated some of its properties. A necessary and sufficient condition is given for a product bipolar fuzzy graph to be isomorphic to its corresponding product bipolar fuzzy line graph. It is also examined when an\nisomorphism between two product bipolar fuzzy graphs follows from an isomorphism of their corresponding fuzzy line graphs.","authors":["Ganesh Ghorai","Madhumangal Pal"],"meta":["June 2017International Journal of Applied and Computational Mathematics 3(2):605-619","DOI:10.1007/s40819-015-0112-0","Project: Fuzzy graph"],"references":["314375949_Complete_fuzzy_graphs","301851029_Irregular_Bipolar_Fuzzy_Graphs","295908728_A_study_on_m-polar_fuzzy_planar_graphs","283005097_On_some_operations_and_density_of_m-polar_fuzzy_graphs","279447919_A_study_on_bipolar_fuzzy_graphs","278965084_Bipolar_Fuzzy_Graphs_with_Categorical_Properties","276849270_m-Step_fuzzy_competition_graphs","319395141_Graph_Theory","283157319_Bipolar_fuzzy_graphs","276849299_A_study_on_bipolar_fuzzy_graphs"]}
