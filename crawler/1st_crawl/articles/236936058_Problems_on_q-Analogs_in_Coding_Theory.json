{"id":"236936058_Problems_on_q-Analogs_in_Coding_Theory","abstract":"The interest in $q$-analogs of codes and designs has been increased in the\nlast few years as a consequence of their new application in error-correction\nfor random network coding. There are many interesting theoretical, algebraic,\nand combinatorial coding problems concerning these q-analogs which remained\nunsolved. The first goal of this paper is to make a short summary of the large\namount of research which was done in the area mainly in the last few years and\nto provide most of the relevant references. The second goal of this paper is to\npresent one hundred open questions and problems for future research, whose\nsolution will advance the knowledge in this area. The third goal of this paper\nis to present and start some directions in solving some of these problems.","authors":["Tuvi Etzion"],"meta":["May 2013","SourcearXiv"],"references":["329786730_Handbook_of_combinatorial_designs","313576952_Partial_t-spreads_and_group_constructible_s_r-nets","290762086_Blocking_s-dimensional_subspaces_by_lines_in_PG2s_q","269007994_Generalisation_of_Fisher's_inequality_to_fields_with_more_than_one_element","268648143_A_Characteristic_Property_of_Geometric_t-Spreads_in_Finite_Projective_Spaces","267118409_On_q-analogs_of_Steiner_systems_and_covering_designs","266438878_The_current_status_of_Turan's_problem_on_hypergraphs","266224627_Bose-Burton_type_theorems_for_finite_projective_affine_and_polar_spaces","265435616_Interrelation_of_Preparata_and_Hamming_Codes_and_Extension_of_Hamming_Codes_to_New_Double-Error-Correcting_Codes","265356186_An_algebraic_approach_to_association_schemes_and_coding_theory","261121901_Sequence_Reconstruction_for_Grassmann_Graphs_and_Permutations","260302489_The_Asymptotic_Behavior_of_Grassmannian_Codes","262364612_Systematic_construction_of_q-analogs_of_designs","262251881_List_decoding_reed-solomon_algebraic-geometric_and_gabidulin_subcodes_up_to_the_singleton_bound","261450351_Fast_enumeration_for_Grassmannian_space"]}
