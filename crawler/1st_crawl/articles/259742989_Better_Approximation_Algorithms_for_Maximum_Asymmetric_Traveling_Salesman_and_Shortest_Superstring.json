In this paper we give a\nfast combinatorial $\\frac 34$-approximation algorithm for Max ATSP. It is based\non a novel use of {\\it half-edges}, matchings and a new method of edge\ncoloring. (A {\\it half-edge} of edge $(u,v)$ is informally speaking \"either a\nhead or a tail of $(u,v)$\".) The current best approximation algorithms for Max\nATSP, achieving the approximation guarantee of $\\frac 23$, are due to Kaplan,\nLewenstein, Shafrir and Sviridenko and Elbassioni, Paluch, van Zuylen. Using a\nrecent result by Mucha, which states that an $\\alpha$-approximation algorithm\nfor Max ATSP implies a $(2+\\frac{11(1-\\alpha)}{9-2\\alpha})$-approximation\nalgorithm for the shortest superstring problem (SSP), we obtain also a $(2\n\\frac{11}{30} \\approx 2,3667)$-approximation algorithm for SSP, beating the\npreviously best known (having approximation factor equal to $2 \\frac{11}{23}\n\\approx 2,4782$.)","authors":["Katarzyna Paluch"],"meta":["January 2014","SourcearXiv"],"references":["226478440_3544-approximation_for_Asymmetric_Maximum_TSP_with_Triangle_Inequality","225074944_Lyndon_Words_and_Short_Superstrings","282205916_Towards_a_DNA_sequencing_theory","279898393_2_12_-approximation_algorithm_for_shortest_superstring","254374671_Improved_Length_Bounds_for_the_Shortest_Superstring_Problem_Extended_Abstract","242929791_The_Traveling_Salesman_Problem_with_Distances_One_and_Two","239066452_An_Analysis_of_Approximations_for_Finding_a_Maximum_Weight_Hamiltonian_Circuit","230596039_Matching_theory","225191393_Improved_length_bounds_for_the_shortest_superstring_problem","223678501_A_greedy_approximation_algorithm_for_constructing_shortest_common_superstrings"]}
