{"id":"319983244_Asynchronous_consensus_of_second-order_multi-agent_systems_with_impulsive_control_and_measurement_time-delays","abstract":"This paper investigates the asynchronous consensus of second-order multi-agent systems with directed networks and measurement time-delays via impulsive control. It is assumed that each agent receives the measurements of the information from its neighboring agents and itself according to its own sampling clock, and different agents can have independent sampling times. The controller of agent is designed in impulsive framework and changes agent's state instantaneously. By transforming the consensus problem into static consensus and using common Lyapunov function, it is proved that there exist protocol parameters ensuring consensus. Also, the design of the parameters is given in a specific form. Finally, simulation examples are drawn to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.","authors":["Fangcui Jiang","Bo Liu","Yongjun Wu","Yunru Zhu"],"meta":["September 2017Neurocomputing 275","DOI:10.1016/j.neucom.2017.09.040"],"references":["263930232_Consensus_of_Switched_Multiagent_Systems","260661599_Consensus_of_Multi-Agent_Networks_With_Aperiodic_Sampled_Communication_Via_Impulsive_Algorithms_Using_Position-Only_Measurements","224347222_Asynchronous_Consensus_Protocols_Using_Nonlinear_Paracontractions_Theory","3032094_Beard_RW_Consensus_seeking_in_multiagent_systems_under_dynamically_changing_interaction_topologies_IEEE_Trans_Autom_Control_505_655-661","311505964_Recent_Advances_in_Consensus_of_Multi-Agent_Systems_A_Brief_Survey","309452585_Static_consensus_of_second-order_multi-agent_systems_with_impulsive_algorithm_and_time-delays","308012608_Group_consensus_tracking_control_of_second-order_multi-agent_systems_with_directed_fixed_topology","303795503_Group_consensus_for_second-order_discrete-time_multi-agent_systems_with_time-varying_delays_under_switching_topologies","303293436_Observer-based_Robust_Consensus_Control_for_Multi-agent_Systems_With_Noises","301539196_Synchronizing_nonlinear_complex_networks_via_switching_disconnected_topology","297597601_Quantized_Iterative_Learning_Consensus_Tracking_of_Digital_Networks_With_Limited_Information_Communication","277689523_Constrained_consensus_of_asynchronous_discrete-time_multi-agent_systems_with_time-varying_topology","272102295_Second-order_group_consensus_for_multi-agent_systems_with_time_delays","265688331_Semi-global_containment_control_of_multi-agent_systems_with_input_saturation","264456893_Average_consensus_of_continuous-time_multi-agent_systems_with_quantized_communication","264052010_Robust_semi-global_coordinated_tracking_of_linear_multi-agent_systems_with_input_saturation","261959846_Finite-time_consensus_of_multiple_second-order_dynamic_agents_without_velocity_measurements","260542223_Stationary_Consensus_of_Asynchronous_Discrete-Time_Second-Order_Multi-Agent_Systems_Under_Switching_Topology","257012411_Continuous-time_consensus_with_discrete-time_communications","256660765_Impulsive_consensus_algorithms_for_second-order_multi-agent_networks_with_sampled_information","233246031_Asynchronous_consensus_of_continuous-time_multi-agent_systems_with_intermittent_measurements","229864483_Consensus_Control_for_a_Class_of_Networks_of_Dynamic_Agents","224529595_Consensus_of_Multi-Agent_Systems_in_Directed_Networks_With_Nonuniform_Time-Varying_Delays","224329549_Agreeing_Asynchronously","221933030_Murray_R_Consensus_Problems_in_Networks_of_Agents_With_Switching_Topology_and_Time-Delays_IEEE_Trans_Automat_Control_499_1520-1533","221933025_Consensus_and_Cooperation_in_Networked_Multi-Agent_Systems","220519489_Finite-time_weighted_average_consensus_with_respect_to_a_monotonic_function_and_its_application","220387411_Sampled-Data_Based_Consensus_of_Continuous-Time_Multi-Agent_Systems_With_Time-Varying_Topology","30856814_Distributed_multi-vehicle_coordinated_control_via_local_information_exchange","3478030_Consensus_strategies_for_cooperative_control_of_vehicle_formations","3031499_Coordination_of_Groups_of_Mobile_Autonomous_Agents_Using_Nearest_Neighbor_Rules","2133530_Asynchronous_Consensus_in_Continuous-Time_Multi-Agent_Systems_With_Switching_Topology_and_Time-Varying_Delays"]}
