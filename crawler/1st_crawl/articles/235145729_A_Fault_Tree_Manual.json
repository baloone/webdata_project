{"id":"235145729_A_Fault_Tree_Manual","abstract":"The paper is intended to give the reader a basic background in the system safety technique of fault tree analysis and related concepts. Four example problems illustrate the construction of the tree, combination of probabilities, and use of Boolean algebra. The description of simulation techniques provides a bridge from simple example problems to actual complex systems. (Author)","authors":["Thomas W.
