We have derived a new auxiliary result for (p 1 p 2 , q 1 q 2)-integral. Meanwhile, by using the symmetry of an auxiliary result, it is shown that novel variants of the the Hermite-Hadamard type for (p 1 p 2 , q 1 q 2)-differentiable utilizing new definitions of generalized higher-order strongly pre-invex and quasi-pre-invex mappings. It is to be acknowledged that this research study would develop new possibilities in pre-invex theory, quantum mechanics and special relativity frameworks of varying nature for thorough investigation.
