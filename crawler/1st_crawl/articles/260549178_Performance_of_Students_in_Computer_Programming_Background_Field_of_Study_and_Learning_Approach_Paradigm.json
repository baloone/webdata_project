This paper studies the background of students, their fields of study and learning approaches applied to the study of programming courses. It is worth considering as a major factor and necessary to research into the causes of failure of students in programming courses from the learner perspective. Programming courses form part of the core concentration areas for students especially studying Information Technology (IT) and Computer Science as well as those other fields of study sandwiched with IT in an undergraduate degree programs. Through the use of questionnaires, interviews and focused group, a survey was conducted using one hundred (100) students at the middle and end of the semester. The responses from the three groups of students were compared. Their opinions to the usefulness of their background, field of study and learning approaches toward programming courses were investigated. The needs and concerns about these key factors are highlighted in the survey and discussed thereby leading to the inferences made and then proposed recommendations on the learning approach in relation to the background and field of study of students in computer programming courses in order to improve understanding of programming by students, hence, reducing failure rates.","authors":["Prince YawOwusuAmoako","Kofi Sarpong Adu-Manu","John Kingsley Arthur","Charles Adjetey"],"meta":["September 2013International Journal of Computer Applications 77(12):17-21","DOI:10.5120/13446-1221"],"references":["259843612_Approaches_to_learning_in_computer_programming_students_and_their_effect_on_success","221537711_A_study_of_the_impact_of_student_background_and_preparedness_on_outcomes_in_CS_I","272495170_Research_Methodology_Methods_Techniques","271729841_Development_and_Validation_of_Scores_on_a_Computer_Programming_Self-Efficacy_Scale_and_Group_Analyses_of_Novice_Programmer_Self-Efficacy","268001177_A_Study_of_Factors_Promoting_Success_in_Computer_Science","250888348_Identifying_predictors_of_success_for_an_objects-first_CS1","248979405_Using_the_student_learning_framework_to_explore_the_variation_in_academic_performance_of_European_business_students","248590941_A_study_of_the_impact_of_student_background_and_preparedness_on_outcomes_in_CSI","238724098_Contributing_factors_to_success_in_computer_science_a_study_of_gender_differences","234801254_Case_studies_in_admissions_to_and_early_performance_in_computer_science_degrees","220808144_ASSISTing_CS1_Students_to_Learn_Learning_Approaches_and_Object-Oriented_Programming","2351521_What_Makes_Them_Succeed_Entry_progression_and_graduation_in_Computer_Science","220612873_Predictors_of_success_and_failure_in_a_CS1_course","220422189_Identifying_Potential_to_Acquire_Programming_Skill","2498207_Learning_Programming_Online_Student_Perceptions_and_Performance"]}
