{"id":"309082521_Motion_Segmentation_Via_a_Sparsity_Constraint","abstract":"Motion segmentation is an important task for intelligent transportation systems. In this paper, inspired by the fact that a feature point trajectory can be sparsely represented as a combination of several feature point trajectories that share coherent transformations, an efficient and effective motion segmentation method with a sparsity constraint is proposed. Specifically, we first propose an accumulated scheme to efficiently integrate motion information from all the frames of a video sequence to construct a correlation matrix. Then, a sparse affinity matrix is built on the correlation matrix by using information-theoretic principles, where the nonzero elements in the same row of the sparse affinity matrix correspond to the feature point trajectories more likely belonging to the same motion. Thereafter, a segment and merge procedure is proposed to effectively estimate the number of motions via the sparse affinity matrix. Finally, by applying spectral clustering on the sparse affinity matrix, different motions in the video sequence are accurately segmented based on the estimated number of motions. Experimental results on the Hopkins 155 and the 62-clip datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance compared with several state-of-the-art methods.","authors":["Taotao Lai","Hanzi Wang","Yan Yan","Tat-Jun Chin"],"meta":["October 2016IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems PP(99):1-11","DOI:10.1109/TITS.2016.2596296"],"references":["279925450_Clustering_with_Hypergraphs_The_Case_for_Large_Hyperedges","279201188_Structured_Sparse_Subspace_Clustering_A_Unified_Optimization_Framework","261116002_Higher_Order_Motion_Models_and_Spectral_Clustering","260340322_Efficient_Semidefinite_Spectral_Clustering_via_Lagrange_Duality","259584433_A_New_Approach_To_Two-View_Motion_Segmentation_Using_Global_Dimension_Minimization","224565308_Yung_NHC_Extraction_of_Moving_Objects_from_Their_Background_Based_on_Multiple_Adaptive_Thresholds_and_Boundary_Evaluation_IEEE_Transactions_on_Intelligent_Transportation_Systems_111_40-51","224164285_Multi-Structure_Model_Selection_via_Kernel_Optimisation","215721835_Self-Tuning_Spectral_Clustering","215458778_Shape_and_motion_from_image_streams_under_orthography_A_factorization_method","47438412_Hybrid_Linear_Modeling_via_Local_Best-Fit_Flats","45721114_Motion_Segmentation_in_the_Presence_of_Outlying_Incomplete_or_Corrupted_Trajectories","43345866_Parallel_Spectral_Clustering_in_Distributed_Systems","4260095_A_Benchmark_for_the_Comparison_of_3-D_Motion_Segmentation_Algorithms","313557209_Random_sample_consensus_A_paradigm_for_model_fitting_applications_to_image_analysis_and_automated_cartography","286594122_Rigid_Motion_Segmentation_Using_Randomized_Voting","286108157_Robust_Subspace_Segmentation_with_Block-Diagonal_Prior","279737890_Exploiting_Unsupervised_and_Supervised_Constraints_for_Subspace_Clustering","268885968_Multiple_view_geometry_in_computer_vision_With_foreword_by_Olivier_Faugeras_2nd_edition","262257615_Multi-scale_Clustering_of_Frame-to-Frame_Correspondences_for_Motion_Segmentation","262251364_Minimal_Basis_Facility_Location_for_Subspace_Segmentation","262160473_Perspective_Motion_Segmentation_via_Collaborative_Clustering","260543540_Robust_Segmentation_of_Moving_Vehicles_Under_Complex_Outdoor_Conditions","236061588_Sparse_Subspace_Clustering_Algorithm_Theory_and_Applications","225399870_Perspective_n-View_Multibody_Structure-and-Motion_Through_Model_Selection","223969598_Robust_Recovery_of_Subspace_Structures_by_Low-Rank_Representation","221618570_The_Ordered_Residual_Kernel_for_Robust_Motion_Subspace_Clustering","221303937_Object_Segmentation_by_Long_Term_Analysis_of_Point_Trajectories","220660375_Optimization_Algorithms_on_Subspaces_Revisiting_Missing_Data_Problem_in_Low-Rank_Matrix","51778731_Simultaneously_Fitting_and_Segmenting_Multiple-Structure_Data_with_Outliers","51574324_Accelerated_Hypothesis_Generation_for_Multistructure_Data_via_Preference_Analysis","7413865_Generalized_Principal_Component_Analysis_GPCA","3428106_Real-Time_Incremental_Segmentation_and_Tracking_of_Vehicles_at_Low_Camera_Angles_Using_Stable_Features","2373272_Motion_Segmentation_by_Subspace_Separation_and_Model_Selection"]}
