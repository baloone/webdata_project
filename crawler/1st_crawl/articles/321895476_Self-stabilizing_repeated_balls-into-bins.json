{"id":"321895476_Self-stabilizing_repeated_balls-into-bins","abstract":"We study the following synchronous process that we call repeated balls-into-bins. The process is started by assigning n balls to n bins in an arbitrary fashion. In every subsequent round, one ball is extracted from each non-empty bin according to some fixed strategy (random, FIFO, etc), and re-assigned to one of the n bins uniformly at random. We define a configuration legitimate if its maximum load is \\(\\mathcal {O}(\\log n)\\). We prove that, starting from any configuration, the process converges to a legitimate configuration in linear time and then only takes on legitimate configurations over a period of length bounded by any polynomial in n, with high probability (w.h.p.). This implies that the process is self-stabilizing and that every ball traverses all bins within \\(\\mathcal {O}(n\\log ^2 n)\\) rounds, w.h.p.","authors":["Luca Becchetti","Andrea Clementi","Emanuele Natale","F.
