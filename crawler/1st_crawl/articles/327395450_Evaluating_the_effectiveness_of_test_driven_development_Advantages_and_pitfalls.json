{"id":"327395450_Evaluating_the_effectiveness_of_test_driven_development_Advantages_and_pitfalls","abstract":"This paper examines the impact of Test Driven Development on different software parameters such as software quality, cost effectiveness, speed of development, test quality, refactoring phenomena and its impact, overall effort required and productivity, maintainability and time required. The study is based primarily on the research conducted over the last ten years. This work makes a detailed analysis of the effects of test driven development and its applications and intends to help the researchers get a quick insight into its application areas, advantages and pitfalls with respect to the above mentioned parameters evaluated on academically controlled experiments and industrial case studies.","authors":["Zeba Khanam","M.N.
