{"id":"326734297_Designing_Immersive_Serious_Game_Based_on_Soil_Tillage_Horizontal_Plowing_Force_Model","abstract":"The successful modeler must be able to recognize whether a model reflects reality and to identify and deal with divergences between theory and data. In a serious game, the real data allows to support the \"seriousness\" of the game and gives a more authentic state, so that it can realize immersivity. Real data in this study can be generated from experiments using soil bin to determine the effect of angle, depth, and speed on horizontal forces; by comparing the value of the smallest error using the polynomial function of the use of different orders. A result of a mathematical model\nfor horizontal forces on tillage using a moldboard plow was created as a basis for designing an immersivity in the serious game. The smallest error from a polynomial approach indicates that as the larger the cutting angle, the deeper and the faster a large horizontal force will produce.","authors":["Anang Kukuh Adisusilo","Mochamad Hariadi"],"meta":["May 2018","Conference: 2nd ASIA International Multidisciplinary Conference 2018 (AIMC2018)At: Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Johor Bahru, Malaysia","Projects: serious gameimmersive Serious game for soil tillage"],"references":[]}
