{"id":"319535509_Development_of_the_Arabic_Loria_Automatic_Speech_Recognition_system_ALASR_and_its_evaluation_for_Algerian_dialect","abstract":"This paper addresses the development of an Automatic Speech Recognition system for Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and its\nextension to Algerian dialect. Algerian dialect is very diï¿½erent from Arabic dialects of the Middle-East, since it is highly influenced\nby the French language.\nIn this article, we start by presenting the new automatic speech recognition named ALASR (Arabic Loria Automatic Speech\nRecognition) system. The acoustic model of ALASR is based on a DNN approach and the language model is a classical n-gram.\nSeveral options are investigated in this paper to find the best combination of models and parameters. ALASR achieves good results\nfor MSA in terms of WER (14.02%), but it completely collapses on an Algerian dialect data set of 70 minutes (a WER of 89%). In\norder to take into account the impact of the French language, on the Algerian dialect, we combine in ALASR two acoustic models,\nthe original one (MSA) and a French one trained on ESTER corpus. This solution has been adopted because no transcribed speech\ndata for Algerian dialect are available. This combination leads to a substantial absolute reduction of the word error of 24%.","authors":["Mohamed-Amine Menacer","Odile Mella","Dominique Fohr","Denis Jouvet"],"meta":["November 2017","Conference: 3rd International Conference on Arabic Computational Linguistics (ACLing 2017)","Projects: SpeechLanguage ModellingModern Standard Arabic and Dialects"],"references":["319977352_Speech_Recognition_Challenge_in_the_Wild_Arabic_MGB-3","317956929_CALYOU_A_Comparable_Spoken_Algerian_Corpus_Harvested_from_YouTube","307889438_Automatic_Dialect_Detection_in_Arabic_Broadcast_Speech","304169663_Development_of_a_TV_Broadcasts_Speech_Recognition_System_for_Qatari_Arabic","304169497_A_Baseline_Speech_Recognition_System_for_Levantine_Colloquial_Arabic","303989318_Farasa_A_Fast_and_Furious_Segmenter_for_Arabic","283349468_Machine_Translation_Experiments_on_PADIC_A_Parallel_Arabic_DIalect_Corpus","354183974_Sequence-discriminative_training_of_deep_neural_networks","354165946_Crowdsource_a_little_to_label_a_lot_labeling_a_speech_corpus_of_dialectal_Arabic","303517609_Maximum_Likelihood_linear_transformations_for_HMM-based_speech_recognition"]}
