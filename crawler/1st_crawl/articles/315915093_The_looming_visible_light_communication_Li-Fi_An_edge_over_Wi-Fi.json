{"id":"315915093_The_looming_visible_light_communication_Li-Fi_An_edge_over_Wi-Fi","abstract":"In today's fast moving world, Li-Fi is emerging as one of the best technology of the Era. Its promising features like security and speed has made this technology a boom over Wi-Fi. Both Li-Fi and Wi-Fi works on Electromagnetic spectrum for the transfer of data. But Li-Fi uses visible light region whereas Wi-Fi uses Radio Waves for communication. Many Researchers have been currently working on this technology and has come with the speed of 224Gbps. Such innovations have bought greener as well as more secure and less expensive fate of communication. Many researchers are working to introduce the micron size LED bulbs to use them with Li-Fi. In this paper, an attempt is made to prove how the latest technology Li-Fi is better than Wi-Fi also an attempt is made to show how Li-Fi is very much similar to Wi-Fi and how light emitting diode are used to transmit the data which provides us more speed and flexibility then the Wi-Fi technology.","authors":["Nidhi Soni","Mayank Mohta","Tanupriya Choudhury"],"meta":["January 2016","DOI:10.1109/SYSMART.2016.7894519","Conference: 2016 International Conference System Modeling & Advancement in Research Trends (SMART)"],"references":["279530585_Li-Fi_Technology_Data_Transmission_through_Visible_Light","294730662_Li-Fi_Wireless_Communication_Media","275029499_Principles_of_LED_Light_Communications_Towards_Networked_Li-Fi"]}
