{"id":"275504161_What_Is_a_Paraphrase","abstract":"Paraphrases are sentences or phrases that convey the same meaning using different wording. Although the logical definition of paraphrases requires strict semantic equivalence, linguistics accepts a broader, approximate, equivalence-thereby allowing far more examples of \"quasiparaphrase.\" But approximate equivalence is hard to define. Thus, the phenomenon of paraphrases, as understood in linguistics, is difficult to characterize. In this article, we list a set of 25 operations that generate quasi-paraphrases. We then empirically validate the scope and accuracy of this list by manually analyzing random samples of two publicly available paraphrase corpora. We provide the distribution of naturally occurring quasi-paraphrases in English text.","authors":["Rahul Bhagat","Eduard Hovy"],"meta":["September 2013Computational Linguistics 39(3):463-472","DOI:10.1162/COLI_a_00166"],"references":["228971629_Unsupervised_construction_of_large_paraphrase_corpora_Exploiting_massively_parallel_news_sources","220355398_Constructing_Corpora_for_the_Development_and_Evaluation_of_Paraphrase_Systems","345950520_Semantics_From_meaning_to_text_Volume_1","330491221_Introduction_to_Text_Linguistics","222597075_A_study_of_paraphrases","221653248_DIRT_SBTdiscovery_of_inference_rules_from_text"]}
