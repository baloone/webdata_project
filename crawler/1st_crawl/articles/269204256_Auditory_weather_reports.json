{"id":"269204256_Auditory_weather_reports","abstract":"Displaying multiple variables or data sets within a single sonification has been identified as a challenge for the field of auditory display research. We discuss our recent study that evaluates the usability of a sonification that contains multiple variables presented in a way that encouraged perception across multiple auditory streams. We measured listener comprehension of weather sonifications that include the variables of temperature, humidity, wind speed, wind direction, and cloud cover. Listeners could accurately identify trends in five concurrent variables presented together in a single sonification. This demonstrates that it is indeed possible to include multiple variables together within an auditory stream and thus a greater number of variables within a sonification.","authors":["Jonathan H.
