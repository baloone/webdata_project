{"id":"242096448_A_Glimm-Effros_Dichotomy_for_Borel_Equivalence_Relations","abstract":"A basic dichotomy concerning the structure of the orbit space of a transformation group has been discovered by Glimm [G12] in the locally compact group action case and extended by Effros [E 1, E2] in the Polish group action\ncase when additionally the induced equivalence relation is FÏƒ. It is the purpose of this paper to extend the Glimm-Effros dichotomy to the very general context of an arbitrary Borel equivalence relation (not even necessarily induced by a group action). Despite the totally classical descriptive set-theoretic nature of our result, our proof requires the employment of methods of effective descriptive\nset theory and thus ultimately makes crucial use of computability (or recursion) theory on the integers.","authors":["L.
