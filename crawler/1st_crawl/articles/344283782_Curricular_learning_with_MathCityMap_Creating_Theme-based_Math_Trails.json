{"id":"344283782_Curricular_learning_with_MathCityMap_Creating_Theme-based_Math_Trails","abstract":"We introduce the math trail method as an opportunity to teach math outdoors with digital tools. Regardless of proven positive effects on motivation and learning, math trails are so far rarely used to teach a specific math topic. In order to promote the use of math trails as part of regular math lessons and to meet the requirements of outdoor learning, we have developed the concept of so-called theme-based math trails. They are a collection of conceptually related tasks focusing on a specific topic in the mathematics curriculum. This way we try to provide a curriculum-based outdoor learning experience for mathematics teaching. To exemplify the creation of theme-based trails, we have identified characteristic tasks for a trail around the concept of linear functions. By developing design principles, we intend to support teachers in creating a curriculum-based math trails using the MathCityMap system.","authors":["Simon Barlovits","Moritz Baumann-Wehner","Matthias Ludwig"],"meta":["September 2020","Conference: Mathematics Education in the Digital Age (MEDA)At: Linz, Austria","Project: MathCityMap (www.mathcitymap.eu)"],"references":["338719356_MathCityMap_-_Mit_mobilen_Mathtrails_Mathe_draussen_entdecken_In_MNU_Journal_12020_S_29-35","284563842_The_Effects_of_Integrating_Mobile_Devices_with_Teaching_and_Learning_on_Students'_Learning_Performance_A_Meta-Analysis_and_Research_Synthesis","282535987_Using_Mobile_Technology_to_Provide_Outdoor_Modelling_Tasks_-_The_MathCityMap-Project","269317141_Shallow_Gamification_-_Testing_Psychological_Effects_of_Framing_an_Activity_as_a_Game","336030515_Mathematics_Trails_Shallow_and_Deep_Gamification","326503673_Designing_the_Mobile_App-Supported_Math_Trail_Environment_in_Indonesia","310755900_A_pedagogical_framework_for_mobile_learning_Categorizing_educational_applications_of_mobile_technologies_into_four_types"]}
