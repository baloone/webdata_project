{"id":"225649291_Acyclic_Colorings_of_Planar_Graphs","abstract":"A coloring of the vertices of a graph byk colors is called acyclic provided that no circuit is bichromatic. We prove that every planar graph has an acyclic coloring\nwith nine colors, and conjecture that five colors are sufficient. Other results on related types of colorings are also obtained;\nsome of them generalize known facts about “point-arboricity”.","authors":["Branko Grünbaum"],"meta":["December 1973Israel Journal of Mathematics 14(4):390-408","DOI:10.1007/BF02764716"],"references":["324638778_Hamilton_Circuits_of_Convex_Trivalent_Polyhedra_Up_to_18_Vertices","302213410_Colorings_cocolorings_and_determinant_terms","281053663_A_Problem_in_Graph_Coloring","275983343_The_Four_Color_Problem","270150618_A_Problem_in_Graph_Coloring","268774259_A_4-Color_Theorem_for_Toroidal_Graphs","268603878_Hamiltonian_lines_in_cubic_graphs","268532745_The_four_color_problem","267011832_Graph_Theory_and_Probability_II","266846218_An_Analogue_to_the_Heawood_Map-Colouring_Problem","265873388_Zur_Theorie_der_diskreten_Gebilde","265462542_Hamilton_Circuits_of_Convex_Trivalent_Polyhedra_Up_to_18_Vertices","265462541_Grotzsch's_theorem_on_3-colorings","265462385_On_Partitioning_Planar_Graphs","265456971_Quelques_consequences_simples_de_la_formule_d'Euler","255443790_B-sets_and_coloring_problems","243087596_The_Point_Partition_Numbers_of_Closed_2-Manifolds","238868085_A_4-color_theorem_for_toroidal_graphs","238240416_Graphs_with_Forbidden_Subgraphs","227220781_The_point-arboricity_of_a_graph","226404943_A_class_of_point_partition_numbers","226350437_Uber_den_kartographischen_Vierfarbensatz","226087186_Graph_Theory_and_Probability","223128531_Shortness_exponents_of_families_of_graphs","220617023_Partitioning_Planar_Graphs","50332903_The_Four-Color_Problem","37044692_Einfuhrung_in_die_Theorie_der_endlichen_Graphen_II","31192018_The_Point-Arboricity_of_Planar_Graphs"]}
