{"id":"265385906_Very_Deep_Convolutional_Networks_for_Large-Scale_Image_Recognition","abstract":"In this work we investigate the effect of the convolutional network depth on\nits accuracy in the large-scale image recognition setting. Our main\ncontribution is a thorough evaluation of networks of increasing depth, which\nshows that a significant improvement on the prior-art configurations can be\nachieved by pushing the depth to 16-19 weight layers. These findings were the\nbasis of our ImageNet Challenge 2014 submission, where our team secured the\nfirst and the second places in the localisation and classification tracks\nrespectively.","authors":["Karen Simonyan","Andrew Zisserman"],"meta":["September 2014","SourcearXiv"],"references":["266225209_Large_Scale_Distributed_Deep_Networks","265295439_ImageNet_Large_Scale_Visual_Recognition_Challenge","264979485_Caffe_Convolutional_Architecture_for_Fast_Feature_Embedding","259441043_OverFeat_Integrated_Recognition_Localization_and_Detection_using_Convolutional_Networks","259399973_Multi-digit_Number_Recognition_from_Street_View_Imagery_using_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","259367619_Some_Improvements_on_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Network_Based_Image_Classification","221361415_ImageNet_a_Large-Scale_Hierarchical_Image_Database","221303896_Improving_the_Fisher_Kernel_for_Large-Scale_Image_Classification","319770626_Multi-column_Deep_Neural_Networks_for_Image_Classification","319770257_Exact_solutions_to_the_nonlinear_dynamics_of_learning_in_deep_linear_neural_networks","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","310752533_Visualizing_and_understanding_convolutional_networks","263237865_Spatial_Pyramid_Pooling_in_Deep_Convolutional_Networks_for_Visual_Recognition","262974436_Two-Stream_Convolutional_Networks_for_Action_Recognition_in_Videos","261880160_One_weird_trick_for_parallelizing_convolutional_neural_networks","259399927_Deep_Inside_Convolutional_Networks_Visualising_Image_Classification_Models_and_Saliency_Maps","216792879_Backpropagation_Applied_to_Handwritten_Zip_Code_Recognition"]}
