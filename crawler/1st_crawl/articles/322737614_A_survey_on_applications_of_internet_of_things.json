{"id":"322737614_A_survey_on_applications_of_internet_of_things","abstract":"Internet of Things (IoT) is a new standard that has attracted a great interest in both academic and enterprise. It is the interconnection of things in the existing internet framework. It expands the connectedness of individuals and things by providing them unique identifiers and ability to transfer data beyond machine-to-machine and person-to person communication. Now-a-days it had become a big thing in the communication and a vision for future internet. This paper presents a survey on technologies, applications, and future scope of IoT in various domains. At last, a portion of the real difficulties of future research in IoT is discussed briefly.","authors":["Riaz Shaik","N. Kumar Gudapati","N. Kumar Balijepalli","H.R.
