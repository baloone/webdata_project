{"id":"344127383_Automatic_and_Explainable_Labeling_of_Medical_Event_Logs_With_Autoencoding","abstract":"Process mining is a suitable method for knowledge extraction from patient pathways. Structured in event logs, medical events are complex, often described using various medical codes. An efficient labeling of these events before applying process mining analysis is challenging. This paper presents an innovative methodology to handle the complexity of events in medical event logs. Based on autoencoding, accurate labels are created by clustering similar events in latent space. Moreover, the explanation of created labels is provided by the decoding of its corresponding events. Tested on synthetic events, the method is able to find hidden clusters on sparse binary data, as well as accurately explain created labels. A case study on real healthcare data is performed. Results confirm the suitability of the method to extract knowledge from complex event logs representing patient pathways.","authors":["Hugo De Oliveira","Vincent Augusto","Baptiste Jouaneton","Ludovic Lamarsalle"],"meta":["September 2020IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics PP(11)","DOI:10.1109/JBHI.2020.3021790","Project: Predictive Modeling of Patient Pathways using Process Mining and Deep Learning"],"references":["339379776_Towards_the_Use_of_Standardized_Terms_in_Clinical_Case_Studies_for_Process_Mining_in_Healthcare","338349144_Interactive_Data_Cleaning_for_Process_Mining_A_Case_Study_of_an_Outpatient_Clinic's_Appointment_System","325662153_Opportunities_and_challenges_in_developing_deep_learning_models_using_electronic_health_records_data_A_systematic_review","324854147_Systematic_Mapping_of_Process_Mining_Studies_in_Healthcare","324686828_Towards_Unsupervised_Detection_of_Process_Models_in_Healthcare","312118124_Deep_Learning_for_Health_Informatics","306376567_RETAIN_Interpretable_Predictive_Model_in_Healthcare_using_Reverse_Time_Attention_Mechanism","284219155_Doctor_AI_Predicting_Clinical_Events_via_Recurrent_Neural_Networks","222451107_Rousseeuw_PJ_Silhouettes_A_Graphical_Aid_to_the_Interpretation_and_Validation_of_Cluster_Analysis_Comput_Appl_Math_20_53-65","3297301_Workflow_Mining_Discovering_Process_Models_from_Event_Logs","340596701_Optimal_Process_Mining_of_Timed_Event_Logs","340391236_A_Biclustering_Method_for_Heterogeneous_and_Temporal_Medical_Data","339409703_Clinical_Pathway_Analysis_Using_Process_Mining_and_Discrete-Event_Simulation_an_Application_to_Incisional_Hernia","338352067_Clinical_Guidelines_A_Crossroad_of_Many_Research_Areas_Challenges_and_Opportunities_in_Process_Mining_for_Healthcare","338348812_Towards_Privacy-Preserving_Process_Mining_in_Healthcare","330472361_Binary_Classification_on_French_Hospital_Data_Benchmark_of_7_Machine_Learning_Algorithms","325095216_Learning_the_Representation_of_Medical_Features_for_Clinical_Pathway_Analysis","322560628_Stochastic_simulation_of_clinical_pathways_from_raw_health_databases","322348183_Optimal_Process_Mining_for_Large_and_Complex_Event_Logs","321190127_A_systematic_mapping_study_of_process_mining","319770229_Auto-Encoding_Variational_Bayes","318736432_Value_of_a_national_administrative_database_to_guide_public_decisions_From_the_systeme_national_d'information_interregimes_de_l'Assurance_Maladie_SNIIRAM_to_the_systeme_national_des_donnees_de_sante_S","317558136_Deep_EHR_A_Survey_of_Recent_Advances_on_Deep_Learning_Techniques_for_Electronic_Health_Record_EHR_Analysis","316843307_Deep_learning_for_healthcare_review_opportunities_and_challenges","313284383_Extraction_and_optimization_of_classification_rules_for_temporal_sequences_Application_to_hospital_data","312596129_Process_Mining_Data_Science_in_Action","311894057_A_Scalable_Biclustering_Method_for_Heterogeneous_Medical_Data","259400035_Auto-Encoding_Variational_Bayes","222559528_IT_Support_for_Healthcare_Processes_-_Premises_Challenges_Perspectives"]}
