{"id":"315748536_Concurrent_Segmentation_and_Localization_for_Tracking_of_Surgical_Instruments","abstract":"Instrument tracking is an essential requirement for various computer-assisted interventions. To overcome problems such as specular reflection and motion blur, we propose a novel method that takes advantage of the interdependency between localization and segmentation of the tool. In particular, we reformulate the 2D pose estimation as a heatmap regression and thereby enable a robust, concurrent regression of both tasks. Throughout experimental results, we demonstrate that this modeling leads to a significantly higher accuracy than directly regressing the tool's coordinates. The performance is compared to state-of-the-art on a Retinal Microsurgery benchmark and the EndoVis Challenge.","authors":["Iro Laina","Nicola Rieke","Christian Rupprecht","Josue Page"],"meta":["March 2017","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-66185-8_75","Conference: International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention"],"references":["313484707_Detection_and_Localization_of_Robotic_Tools_in_Robot-Assisted_Surgery_Videos_Using_Deep_Neural_Networks_for_Region_Proposal_and_Detection","308133665_Vision-Based_and_Marker-Less_Surgical_Tool_Detection_and_Tracking_a_Review_of_the_Literature","305770331_Real-Time_Segmentation_of_Non-Rigid_Surgical_Tools_based_on_Deep_Learning_and_Tracking","303750237_Deeper_Depth_Prediction_with_Fully_Convolutional_Residual_Networks","233798291_Toward_Detection_and_Localization_of_Instruments_in_Minimally_Invasive_Surgery","311758956_Sensor_substitution_for_video-based_action_recognition","311609041_Deep_Residual_Learning_for_Image_Recognition","308865214_Real-Time_Online_Adaption_for_Robust_Instrument_Tracking_and_Pose_Estimation","308167545_Marker-less_articulated_surgical_tool_detection","305193694_U-Net_Convolutional_Networks_for_Biomedical_Image_Segmentation","304665013_Detection_of_articulated_instruments_in_retinal_microsurgery","303097105_Real-time_Localization_of_Articulated_Surgical_Instruments_in_Retinal_Microsurgery","286512696_Deep_Residual_Learning_for_Image_Recognition","282545365_Detecting_Surgical_Tools_by_Modelling_Local_Appearance_and_Global_Shape","274466422_Visual_Tracking_of_Laparoscopic_Instruments","269338816_Fast_Part-Based_Classification_for_Instrument_Detection_in_Minimally_Invasive_Surgery","236072179_Unified_Detection_and_Tracking_of_Instruments_during_Retinal_Microsurgery"]}
