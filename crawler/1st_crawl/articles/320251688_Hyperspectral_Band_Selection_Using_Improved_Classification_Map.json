{"id":"320251688_Hyperspectral_Band_Selection_Using_Improved_Classification_Map","abstract":"Although it is a powerful feature selection algorithm, the wrapper method is rarely used for hyperspectral band selection. Its accuracy is restricted by the number of labeled training samples and collecting such label information for hyperspectral image is time consuming and expensive. Benefited from the local smoothness of hyperspectral images, a simple yet effective semisupervised wrapper method is proposed, where the edge preserved filtering is exploited to improve the pixel-wised classification map and this in turn can be used to assess the quality of band set. The property of the proposed method lies in using the information of abundant unlabeled samples and valued labeled samples simultaneously. The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated with five real hyperspectral data sets. Compared with other wrapper methods, the proposed method shows consistently better performance.","authors":["Xianghai Cao","Cuicui Wei","Jungong Han","Licheng Jiao"],"meta":["October 2017IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters PP(99):1-5","DOI:10.1109/LGRS.2017.2755541"],"references":["296624460_Class-Separation-Based_Rotation_Forest_for_Hyperspectral_Image_Classification","280632146_Semisupervised_Hyperspectral_Band_Selection_Via_Spectral-Spatial_Hypergraph_Model","272390797_Exemplar_Component_Analysis_A_Fast_Band_Selection_Method_for_Hyperspectral_Imagery","268988352_Classification_with_Noisy_Labels_by_Importance_Reweighting","264549528_Use_intermediate_results_of_wrapper_band_selection_methods_A_first_step_toward_the_optimization_of_spectral_configuration_for_land_cover_classifications","262772218_A_Fast_Volume-Gradient-Based_Band_Selection_Method_for_Hyperspectral_Image","261296072_SpectralSpatial_Hyperspectral_Image_Classification_With_Edge-Preserving_Filtering","257482053_A_review_of_feature_selection_methods_on_synthetic_data","245344040_Classification_of_Hyperspectral_Images_With_Regularized_Linear_Discriminant_Analysis","236228168_Guided_Image_Filtering","313385761_Data_Mining_Practical_Machine_Learning_Tools_and_Techniques","312479944_A_Novel_Wrapper_Approach_for_Feature_Selection_in_Object-Based_Image_Classification_Using_Polygon-Based_Cross-Validation","312478334_Learning_to_Hash_With_Optimized_Anchor_Embedding_for_Scalable_Retrieval","302204208_On_the_mean_accuracy_of_statistical_pattern_recognizers","298902600_Salient_Band_Selection_for_Hyperspectral_Image_Classification_via_Manifold_Ranking","290213913_Supervised_Band_Selection_Using_Local_Spatial_Information_for_Hyperspectral_Image","284004407_Forward_Semi-supervised_Feature_Selection","283246773_Dual-Clustering-Based_Hyperspectral_Band_Selection_by_Contextual_Analysis","280696234_Semisupervised_Pair-Wise_Band_Selection_for_Hyperspectral_Images","276443795_Hyperspectral_Band_Selection_Based_on_Rough_Set","273507403_Efficient_Unsupervised_Band_Selection_Through_Spectral_Rhythms","265855975_Multiple_Feature_Learning_for_Hyperspectral_Image_Classification","242653265_Enhanced_Computer_Vision_With_Microsoft_Kinect_Sensor_A_Review","7641976_Feature_Selection_Based_On_Mutual_Information_Criteria_of_Max-DependencyMax-Relevance_and_Min-Redundancy","3766290_Bilateral_Filtering_for_Gray_and_Color_Images","3449823_Classification_and_Extraction_of_Spatial_Features_in_Urban_Areas_Using_High-Resolution_Multispectral_Imagery","3191811_Scale-Space_And_Edge_Detection_Using_Anisotropic_Diffusion"]}
