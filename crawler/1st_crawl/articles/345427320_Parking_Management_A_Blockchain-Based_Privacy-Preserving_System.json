{"id":"345427320_Parking_Management_A_Blockchain-Based_Privacy-Preserving_System","abstract":"In a smart city, smart parking systems generally strive to facilitate the renting of available private parking spaces to vehicle users (just like timesharing). Existing technologies can authenticate and manage parking spaces and vehicles, but they do not address the need to preserve users' privacy. This article presents the framework for a blockchainbased parking-management system designed to preserve the privacy of its users, without relying on a reliable third-party entity. The proposed system integrates BlockChainOpenSource (BCOS) and smart contract technology to share parking spaces.","authors":["Jiaxi Hu","Debiao He","Qinglan Zhao","Kim-Kwang Raymond Choo"],"meta":["July 2019IEEE Consumer Electronics Magazine 8(4):45-49","DOI:10.1109/MCE.2019.2905490"],"references":["323491592_The_Blockchain_as_a_Decentralized_Security_Framework_Future_Directions","317377712_Blockchain_based_trust_authentication_for_decentralized_sensor_networks","316732772_Blockchain_as_a_Service_for_IoT","315864218_Enabling_the_Sharing_Economy_Privacy_Respecting_Contract_based_on_Public_Blockchain","287135069_A_new_smart_parking_system_based_on_optimal_resource_allocation_and_reservations","318128049_Design_of_a_Privacy-Preserving_Decentralized_File_Storage_with_Financial_Incentives","318081966_How_the_Blockchain_Revolution_Will_Reshape_the_Consumer_Electronics_Industry_Future_Directions","317404291_PIaaS_Cloud-oriented_secure_and_privacy-conscious_parking_information_as_a_service_using_VANETs","315445722_Blockchain_technology_in_the_chemical_industry_Machine-to-machine_electricity_market","282464210_Simple-Yet-Efficient_Construction_and_Revocation_of_Group_Signatures","228640975_Bitcoin_A_Peer-to-Peer_Electronic_Cash_System"]}
