{"id":"231828022_On_the_mobility_of_bodies_in_Rn","abstract":"We may define a mobility problem to be one of the type: ‘Given a (fully or partlys pecified) collection of bodies in ℝn, assumed not to interpenetrate, can they be moved in some (fully or partly specified) fashion?’ Early examples of mobility problems nclude ‘Chinese puzzles’ and Sam Loyd's ‘15 puzzle’ (to which could be added the more recent Rubik's Cube!) Less combinatorial examples include the ‘piano mover’ problem (see, e.g. [2, 3, 9]) and the several recent papers on collision avoidance, such as [1, 5, 6, 7, 8].(Received October 15 1984)","authors":["R.
