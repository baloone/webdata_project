{"id":"326239725_Enhancing_Levenshtein's_Edit_Distance_Algorithm_for_Evaluating_Document_Similarity","abstract":"The content directly taken from pre-published sources is called plagiarized text. Plagiarism is considered to be a major challenge in contemporary research manuscripts. It is very easy to use internet as a source of information. There is a need to find suitable technique, so as to find similarity between two documents. Though there are several methods for text comparison, yet this paper is primary focused on Levenshtein’s edit distance. It is a string metric, which is an effective technique for comparing text documents and for calculating efforts required to transforms one document to another. An effort has been made to improve the performance of Levenshtein’s edit distance algorithm by eliminating stop words while calculating transformation effort.","authors":["Shama Rani","Jaiteg Singh"],"meta":["July 2018","DOI:10.1007/978-981-13-0755-3_6","In book: Computing, Analytics and Networks (pp.72-80)"],"references":["273758433_Adaptating_the_Levenshtein_Distance_to_Contextual_Spelling_Correction","270553655_Introduction_of_the_weight_edition_errors_in_the_Levenshtein_distance","242097394_Parallel_Application_of_Levenshtein_Distance_to_Est_ablish_Similarity_Between_Strings","48180222_Levenshtein_Distance_Technique_in_Dictionary_Lookup_Methods_An_ImprovedApproach","24009232_A_Unified_Algorithm_for_Accelerating_Edit-Distance_Computation_via_Text-Compression","251970827_Determining_Restricted_Damerau-Levenshtein_Edit-Distance_of_Two_Languages_by_Extended_Automata","220424167_A_Technique_for_Computer_Detection_and_Correction_of_Spelling_Errors","51940355_Approximating_Edit_Distance_in_Near-Linear_Time","47841616_One-Gapped_q-Gram_Filters_for_Levenshtein_Distance","36725959_Ordering_the_suggestions_of_a_spellchecker_without_using_context","6397822_A_Normalized_Levenshtein_Distance_Metric"]}
