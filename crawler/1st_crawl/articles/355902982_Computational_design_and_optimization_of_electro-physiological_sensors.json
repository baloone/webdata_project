{"id":"355902982_Computational_design_and_optimization_of_electro-physiological_sensors","abstract":"Electro-physiological sensing devices are becoming increasingly common in diverse applications. However, designing such sensors in compact form factors and for high-quality signal acquisition is a challenging task even for experts, is typically done using heuristics, and requires extensive training. Our work proposes a computational approach for designing multi-modal electro-physiological sensors. By employing an optimization-based approach alongside an integrated predictive model for multiple modalities, compact sensors can be created which offer an optimal trade-off between high signal quality and small device size. The task is assisted by a graphical tool that allows to easily specify design preferences and to visually analyze the generated designs in real-time, enabling designer-in-the-loop optimization. Experimental results show high quantitative agreement between the prediction of the optimizer and experimentally collected physiological data. They demonstrate that generated designs can achieve an optimal balance between the size of the sensor and its signal acquisition capability, outperforming expert generated solutions.","authors":["Aditya Shekhar Nittala","Andreas Karrenbauer","Arshad Khan","Tobias Kraus"],"meta":["November 2021Nature Communications 12(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41467-021-26442-1"],"references":["343764832_Automatic_design_of_mechanical_metamaterial_actuators","341090323_PhysioSkin_Rapid_Fabrication_of_Skin-Conformal_Physiological_Interfaces","337617518_Validation_of_a_Low-Cost_Electromyography_EMG_System_via_a_Commercial_and_Accurate_EMG_Device_Pilot_Study","335472824_Soft_Inkjet_Circuits_Rapid_Multi_Material_Fabrication_of_Soft_Circuits_Using_a_Commodity_Inkjet_Printer","334436008_Topology_optimization_and_3D_printing_of_multimaterial_magnetic_actuators_and_displays","332741740_Like_A_Second_Skin_Understanding_How_Epidermal_Devices_Affect_Human_Tactile_Perception","326595404_Self-Adhesive_and_Ultra-Conformable_Sub-300_nm_Dry_Thin-Film_Electrodes_for_Surface_Monitoring_of_Biopotentials","334514447_Skin_sensors_are_the_future_of_health_care","330488710_Wearable_Graphene_Nanotextile_Embedded_Smart_Armband_for_Cardiac_Monitoring","328088583_PhysioHMD_a_conformable_modular_toolkit_for_collecting_physiological_data_from_head-mounted_displays","323779867_Wrist_and_Arm_Body_Surface_Bipolar_ECG_Leads_Signal_and_Sensor_Study_for_Long-term_Rhythm_Monitoring","322236038_Ultraconformable_Temporary_Tattoo_Electrodes_for_Electrophysiology","324665310_Multi-Touch_Skin_A_Thin_and_Flexible_Multi-Touch_Sensor_for_On-Skin_Input","321317972_Revisiting_the_Functional_Anatomy_of_the_Palmaris_Longus_as_a_Thenar_Synergist_Palmaris_Longus_Functional_Anatomy","319888174_Effects_of_Flexible_Dry_Electrode_Design_on_Electrodermal_Activity_Stimulus_Response_Detection"]}
