{"id":"257778997_Fabrication_of_large_area_hexagonal_boron_nitride_thin_films_for_bendable_capacitors","abstract":"Highly reliable and bendable dielectrics are desired in flexible or bendable electronic devices for future applications. Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) can be used as bendable dielectric due to its wide band gap. Here, we fabricate high quality h-BN films with controllable thickness by a low pressure chemical vapor deposition method. We demonstrate a parallel-plate capacitor using h-BN film as the dielectric. The h-BN capacitors are reliable with a high breakdown field strength of ∼9.0 MV/cm. Tunneling current across the h-BN film is inversely exponential to the thickness of dielectric, which makes the capacitance drop significantly. The h-BN capacitor shows a best specific capacitance of 6.8 μF/cm2, which is one order of magnitude higher than the calculated value.","authors":["Ning Guo","Jinquan Wei","Yi Jia","Huanhuan Sun"],"meta":["August 2013Nano Research 6(8)","DOI:10.1007/s12274-013-0336-4"],"references":["255983039_Electron_tunneling_through_atomically_flat_and_ultrathin_hexagonal_boron_nitride","255761546_Functional_high-k_nanocomposite_dielectrics_for_flexible_transistors_and_inverters_with_excellent_mechanical_properties","233844297_Flexible_transparent_dielectric_capacitors_with_nanostructured_electrodes","231004055_Calculation_of_the_ionic_conductivity_of_h-BN_and_its_effect_on_the_dielectric_loss","45800252_Boron_Nitride_Substrates_for_High-Quality_Graphene_Electronics","24407251_Nanotubular_metal-insulator-metal_capacitor_arrays_for_energy_storage","8937387_The_Interface_Between_Silicon_and_a_High-k_Oxide","313791387_Fiber-based_all-solid-state_flexible_supercapacitors_for_self-powered_systems","263306514_High-performance_hexagonal_boron_nitridebismaleimide_composites_with_high_thermal_conductivity_low_coefficient_of_thermal_expansion_and_low_dielectric_loss","248190676_Conducting_atomic_force_microscopy_studies_on_local_electrical_properties_of_ultrathin_SiO_2_films","243704362_Normal_Modes_in_Hexagonal_Boron_Nitride","243142943_Optical_Properties_of_Electronic_Structure_of_Amorphous_Germanium","236079337_Growth_of_High-Crystalline_Single-Layer_Hexagonal_Boron_Nitride_on_Recyclable_Platinum_Foil","234941747_Template-grown_high-density_nanocapacitor_arrays","234890054_Observation_of_a_hexagonal_BN_surface_layer_on_the_cubic_BN_film_grown_by_dual_ion_beam_sputter_deposition","233938517_Scalable_Synthesis_of_Uniform_Few-Layer_Hexagonal_Boron_Nitride_Dielectric_Films","231210913_Controllable_growth_of_triangular_hexagonal_boron_nitride_domains_on_copper_foils_by_an_improved_low-pressure_chemical_vapor_deposition_method","230857841_Fiber-Based_All-Solid-State_Flexible_Supercapacitors_for_Self-Powered_Systems","230840358_Synthesis_and_Characterization_of_Hexagonal_Boron_Nitride_Film_as_a_Dielectric_Layer_for_Graphene_Devices","230316223_HRTEM_and_EELS_Studies_on_the_Amorphization_of_Hexagonal_Boron_Nitride_Induced_by_Ball_Milling","229318972_SiAl2O3ZnOAl_capacitor_arrays_formed_in_electrochemically_etched_porous_Si_by_atomic_layer_deposition","227160467_Toward_the_Controlled_Synthesis_of_Hexagonal_Boron_Nitride_Films","224540119_Electric_Tunnel_Effect_between_Dissimilar_Electrodes_Separated_by_a_Thin_Insulating_Film","224540004_Generalized_Formula_for_the_Electric_Tunnel_Effect_between_Similar_Electrodes_Separated_by_a_Thin_Insulating_Film","223986278_Paper-Based_Supercapacitors_for_Self-Powered_Nanosystems","221879516_Electron_Tunneling_through_Ultrathin_Boron_Nitride_Crystalline_Barriers","221725413_Large-Scale_Synthesis_of_High-Quality_Hexagonal_Boron_Nitride_Nanosheets_for_Large-Area_Graphene_Electronics","51735637_Skin-like_pressure_and_strain_sensors_based_on_transparent_elastic_films_of_carbon_nanotubes","46123208_Synthesis_of_Few-Layer_Hexagonal_Boron_Nitride_Thin_Film_by_Chemical_Vapor_Deposition","45602693_Large_Scale_Growth_and_Characterization_of_Atomic_Hexagonal_Boron_Nitride_Layers","38026258_Transfer_of_Large-Area_Graphene_Films_for_High-Performance_Transparent_Conductive_Electrodes","8550551_Direct-Bandgap_Properties_and_Evidence_for_Ultraviolet_Lasing_of_Hexagonal_Boron_Ntride_Single_Crystal"]}
