{"id":"353403639_A_Survey_of_Data_Science_Techniques_and_Available_Tools","abstract":"Data science is a very recent terminology. Earlier than data science, we had statisticians. These statisticians skilled in qualitative evaluation of records and organizations hired them to research their standard overall performance and income. With the arrival of a computing technique, cloud storage, and analytical equipment, the field of Computer science merged with information. This gave birth to statistics science. Data science is a booming field of study which has a multidimensional scope for all organizations and industries. Data Science has lots of scientific methods which are made up of statistical techniques, machine learning, artificial intelligence and mathematics under one framework to solve the once complex problems. It gives various information on emerging trends and patterns in a specific model with the help of analyzed data, and predictions are made on that data. This paper is intended to provide an overview of techniques which are used in data science and the tools which are available as an open source for data science.","authors":["Monali Baviskar","Priya Navnath Nagargoje","Priyanka A Deshmukh","Rina R Baviskar"],"meta":["July 2021International Journal of Research in Engineering and Technology 8(4):2395-0056"],"references":["330138339_Big_Data_Concepts_and_Techniques_in_Data_Processing","338528149_Data_Analysis_Types_Process_Methods_Techniques_and_Tools","309887017_Leveraging_Adaptive_IO_to_Optimize_Collective_Data_Shuffling_Patterns_for_Big_Data_Analytics","301335950_Data_Science_in_Action","262562753_Introduction_to_Machine_Learning","241642345_Data_Science_and_Prediction"]}
