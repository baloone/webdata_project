{"id":"325883003_Organizing_blended_learning_for_students_on_the_basis_of_learning_roadmaps","abstract":"The relevance of the problem of organizing blended learning for students is related to the sharpening contradiction between the high potential of this educational technology and the poor methodological elaboration of its use in actual learning practice. With regard to this, the paper is aimed at providing grounds for the methodological system of blended learning for students with learning roadmaps and bringing it to life. The leading idea of the methodological system consists in creating a special subject information environment that enables each student to design their own roadmaps for mastering certain subjects that fulfill the principles of blended learning. Theoretical justification of using the learning roadmaps in teaching the students has been given and blended learning in conditions of subject information environment has been performed in practice. It is shown that the students’ blended learning model based on the course learning roadmap promotes the successful acquisition of IT subjects. The suggested method of organizing the students' blended learning is of interest for the contemporary theory of learning as well as for teachers implementing the elements of e-learning in their educational process. © 2018, Association for Social Studies Educa.
