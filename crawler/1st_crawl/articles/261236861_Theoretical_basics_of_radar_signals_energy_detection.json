{"id":"261236861_Theoretical_basics_of_radar_signals_energy_detection","abstract":"Primary results of fundamental research in the field of radar theory are presented. The novelty of the research consists in the following: within the scope of energy conservation law and Bayes statistical decision theory a new approach to the process of target radar signals detection on the basis of energy criterion is considered. A condition for radio-signals optimal energy detection against a background of receiver intrinsic noise and active interferences is formulated.","authors":["G. Pevtsov","A. Yatsutsenko","Yu.
