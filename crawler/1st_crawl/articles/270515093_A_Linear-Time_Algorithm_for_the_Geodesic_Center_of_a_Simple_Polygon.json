{"id":"270515093_A_Linear-Time_Algorithm_for_the_Geodesic_Center_of_a_Simple_Polygon","abstract":"Given two points in a simple polygon $P$ of $n$ vertices, its geodesic\ndistance is the length of the shortest path that connects them among all paths\nthat stay within $P$. The geodesic center of $P$ is the unique point in $P$\nthat minimizes the largest geodesic distance to all other points of $P$. In\n1989, Pollack, Sharir and Rote [Disc. \\& Comput. Geom. 89] showed an $O(n\\log\nn)$-time algorithm that computes the geodesic center of $P$. Since then, a\nlongstanding question has been whether this running time can be improved\n(explicitly posed by Mitchell [Handbook of Computational Geometry, 2000]). In\nthis paper we affirmatively answer this question and present a linear time\nalgorithm to solve this problem.","authors":["Hee-Kap Ahn","Luis Barba","Prosenjit Bose","Jean-Lou de Carufel"],"meta":["December 2016Discrete & Computational Geometry 56(4)","DOI:10.1007/s00454-016-9796-0","SourcearXiv"],"references":["288060184_Computing_the_L_1_Geodesic_Diameter_and_Center_of_a_Polygonal_Domain","266454262_The_Esther-Klein-problem_in_the_projective_plane","282181276_Computing_the_Geodesic_Centers_of_a_Polygonal_Domain","266018294_Computing_the_Geodesic_Center_of_a_Simple_Polygon","262313114_Approximations_and_optimal_geometric_divide-and-conquer","262174412_Construction_of_epsilon_nets","259298001_Computing_the_L_1_Geodesic_Diameter_and_Center_of_a_Simple_Polygon_in_Linear_Time","248779657_Fast_algorithms_for_finding_nearest_common_ancestor","246317636_Geometric_Shortest_Paths_and_Network_Optimization_Handbook_of_Computational_Geometry","242535453_On_an_extremal_problem_in_Graph_Theory"]}
