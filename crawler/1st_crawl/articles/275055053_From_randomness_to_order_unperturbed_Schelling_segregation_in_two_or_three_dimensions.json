{"id":"275055053_From_randomness_to_order_unperturbed_Schelling_segregation_in_two_or_three_dimensions","abstract":"Schelling's model of segregation, first described in 1969, has become one of\nthe best known models of self-organising behaviour. While Schelling's explicit\nconcern was to understand the mechanisms underlying racial segregation in large\ncities from a game theoretic perspective, the model should be seen as one of a\nfamily, arising in fields as diverse as statistical mechanics, neural networks\nand the social sciences, and which are concerned with interacting populations\nsituated on network structures. Despite extensive study, however, the\n(unperturbed) Schelling model has largely resisted rigorous analysis, prior\nresults in the literature generally pertaining to variants of the model in\nwhich noise is introduced into the dynamics of the system, the resulting model\nthen being amenable to standard techniques from statistical mechanics or\nstochastic evolutionary game theory. A series of recent papers (one by Brandt,\nImmorlica, Kamath, and Kleinberg, and two by the authors), has seen the first\nrigorous analysis of the one dimensional version of the unperturbed model. Here\nwe provide the first rigorous analysis of the two and three dimensional\nunperturbed models, establishing most of the phase diagram, and answering a\nchallenge from a recent paper by Brandt, Immorlica, Kamath, and Kleinberg.","authors":["George Barmpalias","Richard Elwes","Andy Lewis-Pye"],"meta":["September 2016Journal of Statistical Physics 164(6)","DOI:10.1007/s10955-016-1589-6","SourcearXiv"],"references":["283617465_Spin-glass_models_of_neural_networks","243413412_The_Little-Hopfield_model_on_a_sparse_random_graph","303620146_Tipping_Points_in_1-dimensional_Schelling_Models_with_Switching_Agents","303620052_Digital_Morphogenesis_via_Schelling_Segregation","303293158_Difficulty_is_critical_The_importance_of_social_factors_in_modeling_diffusion_of_green_products_and_practices","292215395_Neural_networks_and_physical_systems_with_emergent_collective_computational_abilities","283617410_Emergence_of_Scaling_in_Random_Networks","273352721_Tipping_Points_in_1-Dimensional_Schelling_Models_with_Switching_Agents","269856803_Micromotives_and_Macrobehavior","247326472_Racial_Attitudes_in_America_Trends_and_Interpretations","243408970_LETTER_Statistical_physics_of_the_Schelling_model_of_segregation","235638674_Digital_Morphogenesis_via_Schelling_Segregation","241585035_The_Dynamics_of_Schelling-Type_Segregation_Models_and_a_Nonlinear_Graph_Laplacian_Variational_Problem","235737428_Random_Graph","228350627_Cascading_behavior_in_networks_Algorithmic_and_economic_issues"]}
