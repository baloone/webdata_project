{"id":"330699091_Implementation_of_DoS_and_DDoS_Attacks_on_Cloud_Servers","abstract":"Cloud environments face many threats as traditional corporate networks, but due to the vast amount of data stored on cloud servers, providers become an attractive target. Thus the security level of data on the cloud servers is always a key issue from preventing potential attacks. This paper intends to show a relatively easy way to implement a Denial of Service (DoS) attack and/or a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. The used Phyton scripts like HULK or XML-RPC are able to make several hundred requests to the server in short period of time. The HULK is better for DoS attack, while XML-RPC is for pure DDoS attack. It is concluded that with proper tools and applications, the access to the VM and DDoS can be implemented relatively easy way.","authors":["Sefat Mahjabin"],"meta":["December 2018Periodicals of
