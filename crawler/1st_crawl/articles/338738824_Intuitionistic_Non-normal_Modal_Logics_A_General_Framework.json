{"id":"338738824_Intuitionistic_Non-normal_Modal_Logics_A_General_Framework","abstract":"We define a family of intuitionistic non-normal modal logics; they can be seen as intuitionistic counterparts of classical ones. We first consider monomodal logics, which contain only Necessity or Possibility. We then consider the more important case of bimodal logics, which contain both modal operators. In this case we define several interactions between Necessity and Possibility of increasing strength, although weaker than duality. We thereby obtain a lattice of 24 distinct bimodal logics. For all logics we provide both a Hilbert axiomatisation and a cut-free sequent calculus, on its basis we also prove their decidability. We then define a semantic characterisation of our logics in terms of neighbourhood models containing two distinct neighbourhood functions corresponding to the two modalities. Our semantic framework captures modularly not only our systems but also already known intuitionistic non-normal modal logics such as Constructive K (CK) and the propositional fragment of Wijesekeraâ€™s Constructive Concurrent Dynamic Logic.","authors":["Tiziano Dalmonte","Charles Grellois","Nicola Olivetti"],"meta":["October 2020Journal of Philosophical Logic 49(4)","DOI:10.1007/s10992-019-09539-3"],"references":["314092817_Modularisation_of_Sequent_Calculi_for_Normal_and_Non-normal_Modalities","279244198_Intuitionistic_Modal_Logic_A_15-year_retrospective","344552720_Basic_Proof_Theory","333587134_Uniform_interpolation_and_the_existence_of_sequent_calculi","321074139_Neighborhood_Semantics_for_Modal_Logic","318418362_Intuitionistic_modal_logic_based_on_neighborhood_semantics_without_superset_axiom","316792725_Advice_on_Modal_Logic","284534533_Intuitionistic_modal_logic_with_quantifiers","282557636_Obligation_free_choice_and_the_logic_of_weakest_permissions","281886444_Label-free_Modular_Systems_for_Classical_and_Intuitionistic_Modal_Logics","279154308_Tree-sequent_calculi_and_decision_procedures_for_intuitionistic_modal_logics","277334392_On_Nested_Sequents_for_Constructive_Modal_Logics","271951852_Modular_Sequent_Calculi_for_Classical_Modal_Logics","269855613_Norm_and_Action_A_Logical_Enquiry","269575213_Handbook_of_the_History_of_Logic_Logic_and_Computation"]}
