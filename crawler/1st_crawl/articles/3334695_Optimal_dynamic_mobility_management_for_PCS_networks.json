{"id":"3334695_Optimal_dynamic_mobility_management_for_PCS_networks","abstract":"We study a dynamic mobility management scheme: the movement-based location update scheme. An analytical model is applied to formulate the costs of location update and paging in the movement-based location update scheme. The problem of minimizing the total cost is formulated as an optimization problem that finds the optimal threshold in the movement-based location update scheme. We prove that the total cost function is a convex function of the threshold. Based on the structure of the optimal solution, an efficient algorithm is proposed to find the optimal threshold directly. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm is applied to study the effects of changing important parameters of mobility and calling patterns numerically","authors":["Jie Li","Hisao Kameda","KQ Li"],"meta":["July 2000IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking 8(3):319-327","DOI:10.1109/90.851978","SourceIEEE Xplore"],"references":["3334433_PCS_mobility_management_using_the_reverse_virtual_call_setup_algorithm","288528131_Personal_communications_-_A_viewpoint","278858268_Reducing_Location_Update_Cost_in_a_PCS_Network","245449478_Applications_of_CDMA_in_WirelessPersonal_Communications","220293184_Paging_Strategy_Optimization_in_Personal_Communication_Systems","220292468_Location_update_optimization_in_personal_communication_systems","31695924_Wireless_and_personal_communications_systems_VK_Garg_JE_Wilkes","3678303_Reducing_location_update_cost_in_a_PCS_network","3334409_Movement-Based_Location_Update_and_Selective_Paging_for_PCS_Networks","3333248_Mobility_management_for_cellular_telephony_networks"]}
