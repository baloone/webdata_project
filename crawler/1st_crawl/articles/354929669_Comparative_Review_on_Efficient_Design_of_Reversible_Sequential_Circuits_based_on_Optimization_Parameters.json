{"id":"354929669_Comparative_Review_on_Efficient_Design_of_Reversible_Sequential_Circuits_based_on_Optimization_Parameters","abstract":"Reversible computing, a well known research area in the field of computer science. One of the aims of reversible computing is to design low power digital circuits that dissipates no energy to heat. The main challenge of designing reversible circuits is to optimize the parameters which make the design costly. In this paper, we review different designs of efficient reversible sequential circuits and prepare a comparative statement based on eight optimization parameters such as Quantum Cost (QC), Delay (del), Garbage Output (GO), Constant Input (CI), Gate Level (GL), Number of Gate (NoG), Type of Gate (ToG), Hardware Complexity (HC) of Circuit.","authors":["Gobinda Karmakar","Saroj Kr.
