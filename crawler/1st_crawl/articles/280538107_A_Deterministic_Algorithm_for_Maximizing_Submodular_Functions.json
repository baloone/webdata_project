{"id":"280538107_A_Deterministic_Algorithm_for_Maximizing_Submodular_Functions","abstract":"The problem of maximizing a non-negative submodular function was introduced\nby Feige, Mirrokni, and Vondrak [FOCS'07] who provided a deterministic\nlocal-search based algorithm that guarantees an approximation ratio of $\\frac 1\n3$, as well as a randomized $\\frac 2 5$-approximation algorithm. An extensive\nline of research followed and various algorithms with improving approximation\nratios were developed, all of them are randomized. Finally, Buchbinder et al.\n[FOCS'12] presented a randomized $\\frac 1 2$-approximation algorithm, which is\nthe best possible.\nThis paper gives the first deterministic algorithm for maximizing a\nnon-negative submodular function that achieves an approximation ratio better\nthan $\\frac 1 3$. The approximation ratio of our algorithm is $\\frac 2 5$. Our\nalgorithm is based on recursive composition of solutions obtained by the local\nsearch algorithm of Feige et al. We show that the $\\frac 2 5$ approximation\nratio can be guaranteed when the recursion depth is $2$, and leave open the\nquestion of whether the approximation ratio improves as the recursion depth\nincreases.","authors":["Shahar Dobzinski","Ami Mor"],"meta":["July 2015","SourcearXiv"],"references":["242914003_An_Analysis_of_Approximations_for_Maximizing_Submodular_Set_Functions-I","225662604_Nonmonotone_Submodular_Maximization_via_a_Structural_Continuous_Greedy_Algorithm","2477877_Maximizing_the_Spread_of_Influence_through_a_Social_Network","265967164_Maximizing_Symmetric_Submodular_Functions","261211772_A_Tight_Linear_Time_12-Approximation_For_Unconstrained_Submodular_Maximization","222420378_Combinatorial_Auctions_with_Decreasing_Marginal_Utilities","221663879_On_the_Hardness_of_Welfare_Maximization_in_Combinatorial_Auctions_withSubmodular_Valuations","220618371_Maximizing_Non-Monotone_Submodular_Functions","45928450_Submodular_Maximization_by_Simulated_Annealing"]}
