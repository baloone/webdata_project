{"id":"316884530_Heuristics_Considering_UX_and_Quality_Criteria_for_Heuristics","abstract":"Heuristic evaluation is a cheap tool with which one can take qualitative measures of a product’s usability. However, since the methodology was first presented, the User Experience (UX) has become more popular but the heuristics have remained the same. In this paper, we analyse the current state of heuristic evaluation in terms of heuristics for measuring the UX. To do so, we carried out a literature review. In addition, we had a look at different heuristics and mapped them with the UX dimensions of the User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ). Moreover, we proposed a quality model for heuristic evaluation and a list of quality criteria for heuristics.","authors":["Frederik Bader","Eva-Maria Schön","Jörg Thomaschewski"],"meta":["December 2017International Journal of Interactive Multimedia and Artificial Intelligence 4(In Press):48-53","DOI:10.9781/ijimai.2017.05.001","Project: Heuristics considering UX and quality criterias for heuristics"],"references":["311982961_Construction_of_a_Benchmark_for_the_User_Experience_Questionnaire_UEQ","226420570_The_Thing_and_I_Understanding_the_Relationship_Between_User_and_Product","221629826_Heuristic_evaluation_of_persuasive_health_technologies","281558830_Developing_SMASH_A_set_of_SMArtphone's_uSability_Heuristics","262273600_A_Tutorial_of_Ten_User_Experience_Heuristics","261075446_Systematic_literature_studies_Database_searches_vs_backward_snowballing","260553083_Usability_Heuristics_Validation_Through_Empirical_Evidences_A_Touchscreen-based_Mobile_Devices_Proposal","252320684_Usability_Heuristics_for_Touchscreen-based_Mobile_Devices","240953629_Designing_the_user_interface_strategies_for_effective_human-computerinteraction","221516167_Usability_Inspection_Methods"]}
