{"id":"339709124_Use_of_Deep_Multi-Target_Prediction_to_Identify_Learning_Styles","abstract":"It is possible to classify students according to the manner they recognize, process, and store information. This classification should be considered when developing adaptive e-learning systems. It also creates a comprehension of the different styles students demonstrate while in the process of learning, which can help adaptive e-learning systems offer advice and instructions to students, teachers, administrators, and parents in order to optimize students’ learning processes. Moreover, e-learning systems using computational and statistical algorithms to analyze students’ learning may offer the opportunity to complement traditional learning evaluation methods with new ones based on analytical intelligence. In this work, we propose a method based on deep multi-target prediction algorithm using Felder–Silverman learning styles model to improve students’ learning evaluation using feature selection, learning styles models, and multiple target classification. As a result, we present a set of features and a model based on an artificial neural network to investigate the possibility of improving the accuracy of automatic learning styles identification. The obtained results show that learning styles allow adaptive e-learning systems to improve the learning processes of students.","authors":["Everton Gomede","Rodolfo MIranda Barros","Leonardo Mendes"],"meta":["March 2020Applied Sciences 10(5):1756","DOI:10.3390/app10051756"],"references":["328711554_Use_of_Felder_and_Silverman_learning_style_model_for_online_course_design","326604239_Students'_learning_style_detection_using_tree_augmented_naive_Bayes","322583421_Application_of_Computational_Intelligence_to_Improve_Education_in_Smart_Cities","322102249_Handling_Imbalanced_Data_A_Survey","312470401_Learningteaching_styles_in_engineering_education","345496340_Soft_Computing_and_Signal_Processing_Proceedings_of_ICSCSP_2018_Volume_2_Proceedings_of_ICSCSP_2018_Volume_2","342096591_Design_of_a_Smart_Mobile_Case_Framework_Based_on_the_Internet_of_Things","330244416_Feasibility_Analysis_of_Blockchain_for_Donation-Based_Crowdfunding_of_Ethical_Projects","329184981_Identification_of_personal_traits_in_adaptive_learning_environment_Systematic_literature_review","312867851_Learning_Style_Identifier_Improving_the_Precision_of_Learning_Style_Identification_Through_Computational_Intelligence_Algorithms"]}
