{"id":"328561865_Multi-image_encryption_scheme_based_on_quantum_3D_Arnold_transform_and_scaled_Zhongtang_chaotic_system","abstract":"A quantum representation model for multiple images is firstly proposed, which could save more storage space than the existing quantum image representation models and allow quantum hardware to encrypt an arbitrary number of images simultaneously. Moreover, the definition and the quantum circuit of quantum 3D Arnold transform are given based on the proposed quantum representation model for multiple images. Furthermore, a novel quantum multi-image encryption scheme is devised by combining quantum 3D Arnold transform and quantum XOR operations with scaled Zhongtang chaotic system. Theoretically, the proposed quantum image encryption scheme could encrypt many images simultaneously. Numerical simulations and theoretical analyses demonstrate that the proposed quantum multi-image encryption scheme outperforms both its classical counterparts and the existing typical quantum image encryption algorithms in terms of security, robustness, encryption capacity and computational complexity.","authors":["Nanrun Zhou","Yan Xingyu","Haoran Liang","Xiangyang Tao"],"meta":["October 2018Quantum Information Processing 17(12)","DOI:10.1007/s11128-018-2104-6","Project: Quantum image encryption"],"references":["324782403_Bit-level_quantum_color_image_encryption_scheme_with_quantum_cross-exchange_operation_and_hyper-chaotic_system","323539166_A_novel_hybrid_encryption_algorithm_based_on_chaos_and_S-AES_algorithm","318602346_Quantum_Image_Encryption_Based_on_Iterative_Framework_of_Frequency-Spatial_Domain_Transforms","317174397_Quantum_image_encryption_scheme_with_iterative_generalized_Arnold_transforms_and_quantum_image_cycle_shift_operations","315973736_Quantum_Multi-Image_Encryption_Based_on_Iteration_Arnold_Transform_with_Parameters_and_Image_Correlation_Decomposition","315525875_A_Simple_Encryption_Algorithm_for_Quantum_Color_Image","314306481_An_image_encryption_algorithm_based_on_compound_homogeneous_hyper-chaotic_system","307442064_An_image_encryption_scheme_based_on_chaotic_tent_map","345648723_Double-image_compression_and_encryption_algorithm_based_on_co-sparse_representation_and_random_pixel_exchanging","324425929_Period_of_a_Discrete_Cat_Mapping","299499164_Quantum_image_encryption_based_on_generalized_affine_transform_and_logistic_map","293045223_A_joint_color_image_encryption_and_compression_scheme_based_on_hyper-chaotic_system","292344273_Quantum_Hash_function_and_its_application_to_privacy_amplification_in_quantum_key_distribution_pseudo-random_number_generation_and_image_encryption","293195955_Novel_Quantum_image_encryption_using_one-dimensional_quantum_cellular_automata","291942453_Simulating_Physics_with_Computers"]}
