{"id":"327484245_Deep_Learning_Approach_for_Short-Term_Stock_Trends_Prediction_Based_on_Two-Stream_Gated_Recurrent_Unit_Network","abstract":"Financial news has been proven to be a crucial factor which causes fluctuations in stock prices. However, previous studies heavily relied on analyzing shallow features and ignored the structural relation among words in a sentence. Several sentiment analysis researches have tried to point out the relationship between investorsâ€™ reaction and news events. However, the sentiment dataset was usually constructed from the lingual dataset which is unrelated to the financial sector and led to poor-performance. This paper proposes a novel framework to predict the directions of stock prices by using both financial news and sentiment dictionary. The original contributions of this study include the proposal of a novel two-stream Gated Recurrent Unit Network and Stock2Vec - a sentiment word embedding trained on financial news dataset and Harvard IV-4. Two main experiments are conducted: the first experiment predicts S&P 500 index stock price directions using the historical S&P 500 prices and the articles crawled from Reuters and Bloomberg, the second experiment forecasts the price trends of VN-index using VietStock news and stock prices from cophieu68. Results show that (1) Two-stream GRU outperforms state-of-the-art models; (2) Stock2Vec is more efficient in dealing with financial datasets; (3) Applying the model, a simulation scenario proves that our model is effective for the stock sector.","authors":["L.
