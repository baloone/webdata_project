{"id":"289858325_ROWLer_-_A_hybrid_rule_engine_for_legal_reasoning","abstract":"In this paper rOWLer, a hybrid rule engine for legal reasoning is presented. The engine combines the expressiveness of rules and ontologies to enable legal reasoning - hence the name \"rOWLer\". It is tailored for use in public administration (tax law, pension law, social benefits law, etc.) and provides a flexible architecture, in particular concerning amendments, which allows for adaption to different requirements.","authors":["J.
