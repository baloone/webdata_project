{"id":"323667856_Dance_Pose_Identification_from_Motion_Capture_Data_A_Comparison_of_Classifiers","abstract":"In this paper, we scrutinize the effectiveness of classification techniques in recognizing dance types based on motion-captured human skeleton data. In particular, the goal is to identify poses which are characteristic for each dance performed, based on information on body joints, acquired by a Kinect sensor. The datasets used include sequences from six folk dances and their variations. Multiple pose identification schemes are applied using temporal constraints, spatial information, and feature space distributions for the creation of an adequate training dataset. The obtained results are evaluated and discussed.","authors":["Eftychios Protopapadakis","Athanasios Voulodimos","Anastasios Doulamis","Stephanos Camarinopoulos"],"meta":["March 2018","DOI:10.3390/technologies6010031","Project: TERPSICHORE"],"references":["323667672_A_Semi-Supervised_Approach_for_Industrial_Workflow_Recognition","322895764_Deep_Learning_for_Computer_Vision_A_Brief_Review","320252341_Extraction_of_key_postures_from_3D_human_motion_data_for_choreography_summarization","317868732_A_Study_on_the_Use_of_Kinect_Sensor_in_Traditional_Folk_Dances_Recognition_via_Posture_Analysis","310734460_Classification_of_Multidimensional_Time-Evolving_Data_Using_Histograms_of_Grassmannian_Points","274633528_A_Game-like_Application_for_Dance_Learning_Using_a_Natural_Human_Computer_Interface","321596166_Support_Vector_Machines_for_Pattern_Classification","315384383_Beginning_Kinect_Programming_with_the_Microsoft_Kinect_SDK","283879817_Unsupervised_Dance_Motion_Patterns_Classification_from_Fused_Skeletal_Data_Using_Exemplar-Based_HMMs","279284805_Semi-Supervised_Image_Meta-Filtering_Using_Relevance_Feedback_in_Cultural_Heritage_Applications"]}
