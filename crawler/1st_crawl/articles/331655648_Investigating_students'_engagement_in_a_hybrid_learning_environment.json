{"id":"331655648_Investigating_students'_engagement_in_a_hybrid_learning_environment","abstract":"Higher learning institutions (HEIs) are using different learning modalities to encourage better performance from students in accomplishing course requirements. A hybrid learning environment introduces opportunities for educational leaders, teachers and learners in finding alternative approaches to enhance traditional brick and mortar setting. A hybrid learning environment was introduced to a group of information technology (IT) and computer sciences (CS) students through a learning management system. The mixed methods study sought to investigate students' participation and enthusiasm in a hybrid learning environment. A survey was presented to the students at the end of the semester. The resulting analysis revealed that students prefer online activities but acknowledged that in-class activities help students learn and understand course work. Results further revealed students' insight of how a successful hybrid learning environment should be handled. The results from this research can provide understanding to help guide future attempts of a hybrid learning environment.","authors":["A Eliveria","L Serami","Lambert Famorca","JS Dela Cruz"],"meta":["March 2019IOP Conference Series Materials Science and Engineering 482:012011","DOI:10.1088/1757-899X/482/1/012011","Project: Hybrid Learning"],"references":["319923164_Analyzing_students_online_learning_behavior_in_blended_courses_using_Moodle","313235877_Perceptions_and_Experience_in_Mobile_Learning_via_SMS_A_Case_Study_of_Distance_Education_Students_in_a_Malaysian_Public_University","283553300_A_blended_learning_framework_for_curriculum_design_and_professional_development","255620924_Blended_learning_Implications_for_growth_and_access","228377822_Evaluation_of_blended_learning_Analysis_of_qualitative_data","314498016_This_content_has_been_downloaded_from_IOPscience_Please_scroll_down_to_see_the_full_text_Properties_of_Concrete_partially_replaced_with_Coconut_Shell_as_Coarse_aggregate_and_Steel_fibres_in_addition_t","257496493_Student_perceptions_and_achievement_in_a_university_blended_learning_strategic_initiative","257496481_Shaping_the_online_experience_How_administrators_can_influence_student_and_instructor_perceptions_through_policy_and_practice","255567084_Perspectives_on_Blended_Learning_in_Higher_Education","232852627_Using_blended_learning_to_increase_learner_support_and_improve_retention"]}
