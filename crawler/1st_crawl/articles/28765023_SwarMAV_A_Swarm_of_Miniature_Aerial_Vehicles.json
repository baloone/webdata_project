{"id":"28765023_SwarMAV_A_Swarm_of_Miniature_Aerial_Vehicles","abstract":"As the MAV (Micro or Miniature Aerial Vehicles) field matures, we expect to see that the platform's degree of autonomy, the information exchange, and the coordination with other manned and unmanned actors, will become at least as crucial as its aerodynamic design. The project described in this paper explores some aspects of a particularly exciting possible avenue of development: an autonomous swarm of MAVs which exploits its inherent reliability (through redundancy), and its ability to exchange information among the members, in order to cope with a dynamically changing environment and achieve its mission. We describe the successful realization of a prototype experimental platform weighing only 75g, and outline a strategy for the automatic design of a suitable controller.","authors":["Renzo de nardi","Owen Holland"],"meta":[],"references":["228858342_The_CSIRO_autonomous_helicopter_project","224617661_Experimental_implementation_of_flocking_algorithms_in_wheeled_mobile_robots","4170879_Beyond_swarm_intelligence_the_UltraSwarm","2797343_Flocks_Herds_and_Schools_A_Distributed_Behavioral_Model","245577567_Autonomous_Minimalist_Following_In_Three_Dimensions_A_Study_with_Small-Scale_Dirigibles","245449436_System_Identification_Modeling_of_a_Small-Scale_Unmanned_Rotorcraft_for_Flight_Control_Design","229091467_Flocking_of_Autonomous_Unmanned_Air_Vehicles","3031499_Coordination_of_Groups_of_Mobile_Autonomous_Agents_Using_Nearest_Neighbor_Rules"]}
