{"id":"225577328_A_Fast_Encoding_Method_for_Vector_Quantization_Using_Modified_Memory-Efficient_Sum_Pyramid","abstract":"Based on the concept of multi-resolutions, full search (FS) equivalent fast search methods for vector quantization (VQ) using mean-type pyramid have been developed in previous work.1â€“4) In this paper, a modified memory-efficient sum pyramid is proposed, which is exact for computing the difference in integer form and features one more new resolution L\n01 in-between the top 2 levels L\n0 and L\n1 of a conventional pyramid. Benefiting from a recursive difference computation at the top 3 levels, the proposed method can reduce the total computational cost obviously. Furthermore, a memory-efficient way of storage for the top 3 levels is integrated to reduce extra memory requirement.","authors":["Zhibin Pan","Koji Kotani","Tadahiro Ohmi"],"meta":["May 2004Optical Review 11(3):170-175","DOI:10.1007/s10-043-0040-z"],"references":["224670345_A_Fast_Search_Algorithm_for_Vector_Quantization_Using_Mean_Pyramids_of_Codewords","222652008_An_improved_search_algorithm_for_vector_quantization_using_mean_pyramid_structure","3381917_Fast_codeword_search_algorithm_for_image_coding_based_on_mean-variance_pyramids_of_codewords","3327482_A_fast_search_algorithm_for_vector_quantization_using_L2-norm_pyramid_of_codewords","2978388_Parallel_vector-quantization_processor_eliminating_redundant_calculations_for_real-time_motion_picture_compression"]}
