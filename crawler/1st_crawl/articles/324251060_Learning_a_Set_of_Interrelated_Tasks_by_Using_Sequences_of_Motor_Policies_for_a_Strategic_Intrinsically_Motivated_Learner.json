{"id":"324251060_Learning_a_Set_of_Interrelated_Tasks_by_Using_Sequences_of_Motor_Policies_for_a_Strategic_Intrinsically_Motivated_Learner","abstract":"See new publication on http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app11030975.\n\nAssistive robotics and particularly robot coaches may be very helpful for rehabilitation healthcare. In this context, we propose a method based on Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model (GP-LVM) to transfer knowledge between a physiotherapist, a robot coach and a patient. Our model is able to map visual human body features to robot data in order to facilitate the robot learning and imitation. In addition , we propose to extend the model to adapt robots' understanding to patient's physical limitations during the assessment of rehabilitation exercises. Experimental evaluation demonstrates promising results for both robot imitation and model adaptation according to the patients' limitations.","authors":["Nicolas Duminy","Sao Mai Nguyen","Dominique Duhaut"],"meta":["October 2018","DOI:10.1109/IRC.2018.00061","Conference: 2018 Second IEEE International Conference on Robotic Computing (IRC)"],"references":["313541747_Strategic_and_interactive_learning_of_a_hierarchical_set_of_tasks_by_the_Poppy_humanoid_robot","257458383_Active_Choice_of_Teachers_Learning_Strategies_and_Goals_for_a_Socially_Guided_Intrinsic_Motivation_Learner","234412726_Active_Learning_of_Inverse_Models_with_Intrinsically_Motivated_Goal_Exploration_in_Robots","224200261_Intrinsically_Motivated_Goal_Exploration_for_Active_Motor_Learning_in_Robots_a_Case_Study","224163311_Goal_Babbling_Permits_Direct_Learning_of_Inverse_Kinematics","221070458_Learning_and_Generalization_of_Motor_Skills_by_Learning_from_Demonstration","316807278_Intrinsic_Motivation_and_Self-Determination_in_Human_Behavior","285433839_Behavioral_Hierarchy_Exploration_and_Representation","261455709_The_Strategic_Student_Approach_for_Life-Long_Exploration_and_Learning","224155872_Reinforcement_Learning_of_Motor_Skills_in_High_Dimensions_A_Path_Integral_Approach"]}
