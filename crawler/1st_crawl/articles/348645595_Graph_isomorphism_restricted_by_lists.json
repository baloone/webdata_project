{"id":"348645595_Graph_isomorphism_restricted_by_lists","abstract":"The complexity of graph isomorphism (GraphIso ) is a famous problem in computer science. For graphs G and H, it asks whether they are the same up to a relabeling of vertices. In 1981, Lubiw proved that list restricted graph isomorphism (ListIso ) is NP -complete: for each u∈V(G), we are given a list L(u)⊆V(H) of possible images of u. After 35 years, we revive the study of this problem and consider which results for GraphIso can be modified to solve ListIso. We prove: 1) Under certain conditions, GI -completeness of a class of graphs implies NP -completeness of ListIso. 2) Several combinatorial algorithms for GraphIso can be modified to solve ListIso: for trees, planar graphs, interval graphs, circle graphs, permutation graphs, and bounded treewidth graphs. 3) ListIso is NP -complete for cubic colored graphs with sizes of color classes bounded by 8 with all lists of size at most 3.","authors":["Pavel Klavík","Dusan Knop","Peter Zeman"],"meta":["January 2021Theoretical Computer Science 860(2)","DOI:10.1016/j.tcs.2021.01.027"],"references":["344486692_Graphs_and_Homomorphisms","336906859_Connectivity_in_Graphs","336402649_Proofs_that_yield_nothing_but_their_validity_and_a_methodology_of_cryptographic_protocol_design","325767438_Descriptive_complexity_canonisation_and_definable_graph_structure_theory","320098307_Finding_Small_Weight_Isomorphisms_with_Additional_Constraints_is_Fixed-Parameter_Tractable","319985821_Polynomial-time_algorithm_for_isomorphism_of_graphs_with_clique-width_at_most_three","314133296_Fixed-Parameter_Tractable_Canonization_and_Isomorphism_Test_for_Graphs_of_Bounded_Treewidth","314001523_On_Construction_and_Identification_of_Graphs","312167792_Graph_isomorphism_for_graph_classes_characterized_by_two_forbidden_induced_subgraphs","309445432_Induced_Minor_Free_Graphs_Isomorphism_and_Clique-Width","308026907_Algorithmic_Aspects_of_Regular_Graph_Covers","308740012_Descriptive_Complexity_of_List_H-Coloring_Problems_in_Logspace_A_Refined_Dichotomy","305871010_Induced_Minor_Free_Graphs_Isomorphism_and_Clique-width","305455699_Polynomial-Time_Algorithm_for_Isomorphism_of_Graphs_with_Clique-Width_at_Most_Three","303907275_Graph_isomorphism_in_quasipolynomial_time_extended_abstract"]}
