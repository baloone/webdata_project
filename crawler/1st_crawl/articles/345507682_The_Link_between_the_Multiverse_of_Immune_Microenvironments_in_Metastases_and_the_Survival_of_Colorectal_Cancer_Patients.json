{"id":"345507682_The_Link_between_the_Multiverse_of_Immune_Microenvironments_in_Metastases_and_the_Survival_of_Colorectal_Cancer_Patients","abstract":"Treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer is based upon the assumption that metastases are homogeneous within a patient. We quantified immune cell types of 603 whole-slide metastases and primary colorectal tumors from 222 patients. Primary lesions, and synchronous and metachronous metastases, had a heterogeneous immune infiltrate and mutational diversity. Small metastases had frequently a low Immunoscore and T and B cell score, while a high Immunoscore was associated with a lower number of metastases. Anti-epidermal growth factor receptor treatment modified immune gene expression and significantly increased T cell densities in the metastasis core. The predictive accuracy of the Immunoscore from a single biopsy was superior to the one of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1). The immune phenotype of the least-infiltrated metastasis had a stronger association with patient outcome than other metastases.","authors":["Marc Van Den Eynde","Bernhard Mlecnik","Gabriela
