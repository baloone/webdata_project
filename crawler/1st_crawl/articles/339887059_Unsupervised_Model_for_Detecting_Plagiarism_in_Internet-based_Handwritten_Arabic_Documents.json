{"id":"339887059_Unsupervised_Model_for_Detecting_Plagiarism_in_Internet-based_Handwritten_Arabic_Documents","abstract":"Due to the rapid increase of internet-based data, there is urgent need for a robust intelligent documents security mechanism. Although there are many attempts to build a plagiarism detection system in natural language documents, the unlimited variation and different writing styles of each character in Arabic documents make building such systems challenging. Based on its position in a word, the same Arabic letter can be written three different ways, which makes the handwritten character recognition a cumbersome process. This article proposes an intelligent unsupervised model to detect plagiarism in these documents called ASTAP. First, a handwritten Arabic character recognition system is proposed using the Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) algorithm. Then, a modified Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) is used to match the contents of the Arabic documents to detect any similarity. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, ASTAP improves the effectiveness of the plagiarism detection in terms of the matched similarity ratio, the precision ratio, and the processing time.","authors":["Mahmoud Zaher","Abdulaziz Shehab","Mohamed Elhoseny"],"meta":["March 2020Journal of Organizational and End User Computing 32(2):42-66","DOI:10.4018/JOEUC.2020040103"],"references":["322279551_Intelligent_information_system_to_ensure_quality_in_higher_education_institutions_towards_an_automated_e-university","319404614_A_New_Model_for_Detecting_Similarity_in_Arabic_Documents","313805557_A_hybrid_scheme_for_Automated_Essay_Grading_based_on_LVQ_and_NLP_techniques","322589027_FPSS_Fingerprint-based_semantic_similarity_detection_in_big_data_environment","318915011_Tianji_Implementation_of_an_Efficient_Tracking_Engine_in_Mobile_Internet_Era","313600344_Automatic_plagiarism_detection_for_spoken_responses_in_an_assessment_of_English_language_proficiency","313291769_Extraction_of_Emotions_from_Multilingual_Text_Using_Intelligent_Text_Processing_and_Computational_Linguistics","311756563_Near_duplicate_text_detection_using_graph_depiction","311429317_iChecker_An_Efficient_Plagiarism_Detection_Tool_for_Learning_Management_Systems","311255055_Efficiency_comparison_of_various_plagiarism_detection_techniques"]}
