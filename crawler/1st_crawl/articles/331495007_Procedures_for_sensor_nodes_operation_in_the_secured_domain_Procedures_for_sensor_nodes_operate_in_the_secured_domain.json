Such networks can be a source of data for critical infrastructure systems if, in addition to the timeliness (freshness) of the data, it will also be possible to ensure the reliability of these data. Such requirements are met by a secure domain of sensor nodes, in which all sensor nodes are authenticated, sensitive data is stored in protected resources of sensor nodes, and data exchange in the domain and outside the domain is cryptographically protected. This paper presents the concept of a safe domain of sensor nodes for IoT and describes the data structures necessary to ensure security in the domain and the way of protecting the resources of each node. Particular attention was paid to the procedure of preparing a sensor node for work in a secured domain of sensor nodes.","authors":["Janusz Furtak","Zbigniew Zielinski","Jan Chudzikiewicz"],"meta":["March 2019Concurrency and Computation Practice and Experience 32(4):e5183","DOI:10.1002/cpe.5183"],"references":["264842603_A_Tiny_RSA_Cryptosystem_Based_On_Arduino_Microcontroller_Useful_For_Small_Scale_Networks","325573319_Secured_Domain_of_Sensor_Nodes_-_A_New_Concept","315060057_Comparative_Study_of_Authenticated_Encryption_Targeting_Lightweight_IoT_Applications","310823878_Adaptive_Clustering_for_Dynamic_IoT_Data_Streams"]}
