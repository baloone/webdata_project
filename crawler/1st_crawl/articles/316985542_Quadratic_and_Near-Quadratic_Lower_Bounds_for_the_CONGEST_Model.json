{"id":"316985542_Quadratic_and_Near-Quadratic_Lower_Bounds_for_the_CONGEST_Model","abstract":"We present the first super-linear lower bounds for natural graph problems in the CONGEST model, answering a long-standing open question. Specifically, we show that any exact computation of a minimum vertex cover or a maximum independent set requires $\\Omega(n^2/\\log^2{n})$ rounds in the worst case in the CONGEST model, as well as any algorithm for $\\chi$-coloring a graph, where $\\chi$ is the chromatic number of the graph. We further show that such strong lower bounds are not limited to NP-hard problems, by showing two simple graph problems in P which require a quadratic and near-quadratic number of rounds. Finally, we address the problem of computing an exact solution to weighted all-pairs-shortest-paths (APSP), which arguably may be considered as a candidate for having a super-linear lower bound. We show a simple $\\Omega(n)$ lower bound for this problem, which implies a separation between the weighted and unweighted cases, since the latter is known to have a complexity of $\\Theta(n/\\log{n})$. We also formally prove that the standard Alice-Bob framework is incapable of providing a super-linear lower bound for exact weighted APSP, whose complexity remains an intriguing open question.","authors":["Keren Censor-Hillel","Seri Khoury","Ami Paz"],"meta":["May 2017"],"references":["314260021_Distributed_Exact_Shortest_Paths_in_Sublinear_Time","305674905_Brief_Announcement_Local_Independent_Set_Approximation","304608977_The_Locality_of_Distributed_Symmetry_Breaking","303901556_Distributed_1-coloring_in_sublogarithmic_rounds","280546275_Losing_Weight_by_Gaining_Edges","236455854_Exact_Weight_Subgraphs_and_the_k-Sum_Conjecture","228532403_A_Primal-Dual_Bicriteria_Distributed_Algorithm_for_Capacitated_Vertex_Cover","221660970_Tri_Tri_Again_Finding_Triangles_and_Small_Subgraphs_in_a_Distributed_Setting","221233351_Distributed_Coloring_Depending_on_the_Chromatic_Number_or_the_Neighborhood_Growth","220617911_A_Near-Tight_Lower_Bound_on_the_Time_Complexity_of_Distributed_Minimum-Weight_Spanning_Tree_Construction","220617236_An_Unconditional_Lower_Bound_on_the_Time-Approximation_Trade-off_for_the_Distributed_Minimum_Spanning_Tree_Problem","220555416_Distributed_approximation_A_survey","220390592_Distributed_Weighted_Vertex_Cover_via_Maximal_Matchings","216777913_Distributed_and_Parallel_Algorithms_for_Weighted_Vertex_Cover_and_Other_Covering_Problems","47796790_Distributed_Verification_and_Hardness_of_Distributed_Approximation","45904995_Deterministic_Distributed_Vertex_Coloring_in_Polylogarithmic_Time","30530336_Some_Simple_Distributed_Algorithms_for_Sparse_Networks","29603113_Distributed_Computing_with_Advice_Information_Sensitivity_of_Graph_Coloring","321074478_A_Time_Hierarchy_Theorem_for_the_LOCAL_Model","318576282_Distributed_Approximation_of_Maximum_Independent_Set_and_Maximum_Matching","317639762_Finding_even_cycles_faster_via_capped_k-walks","312435303_Local_Conflict_Coloring","310822156_Deterministic_D_1-Coloring_in_Sublinear_in_D_Time_in_Static_Dynamic_and_Faulty_Networks","307624019_Near-Linear_Lower_Bounds_for_Distributed_Distance_Computations_Even_in_Sparse_Networks","307623972_Distributed_Construction_of_Purely_Additive_Spanners","305660860_A_Distributed_2e-Approximation_for_Vertex_Cover_in_Ologde_log_log_d_Rounds","305660764_Brief_Announcement_An_Exponential_Separation_Between_Randomized_and_Deterministic_Complexity_in_the_LOCAL_Model","305081869_Brief_Announcement_A_Tight_Distributed_Algorithm_for_All_Pairs_Shortest_Paths_and_Applications","303901406_A_deterministic_almost-tight_distributed_algorithm_for_approximating_single-source_shortest_paths","286375160_Finding_minimizing_and_counting_weighted_subgraphs","274864812_Distributed_Delta1-Coloring_in_Linear_in_Delta_Time","269417789_Approximation_of_Distances_and_Shortest_Paths_in_the_Broadcast_Congest_Clique","262335047_Distributed_Algorithms_for_Network_Diameter_and_Girth","262157496_Efficient_distributed_source_detection_with_limited_bandwidth","239593861_Distributed_Computing_A_Locality-Sensitive_Approach","226833824_Fast_Distributed_Approximations_in_Planar_Graphs","225620182_Coloring_unstructured_radio_networks","224872176_On_the_Locality_of_Some_NP-Complete_Problems","223881020_Deterministic_coin_tossing_with_applications_to_optimal_parallel_list_ranking","222431791_A_simple_local_3-approximation_algorithm_for_vertex_cover","221343608_A_tight_unconditional_lower_bound_on_distributed_random_walk_computation","221257569_Fast_distributed_approximation_algorithms_for_vertex_cover_and_set_cover_in_anonymous_networks","221234140_A_Local_2-Approximation_Algorithm_for_the_Vertex_Cover_Problem","221233935_Leveraging_Linial's_Locality_Limit","220779921_Networks_Cannot_Compute_Their_Diameter_in_Sublinear_Time","220690121_Communication_Complexity","220616685_Locality_in_Distributed_Graph_Algorithms","220533413_On_the_Distributed_Complexity_of_Computing_Maximal_Matchings","220406498_A_Primal-Dual_Parallel_Approximation_Technique_Applied_to_Weighted_Set_and_Vertex_Cover","47821775_Local_Computation_Lower_and_Upper_Bounds","2426869_Finding_and_Counting_Given_Length_Cycles"]}
