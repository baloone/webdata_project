{"id":"304022272_Asynchronous_Gathering_in_Rings_with_4_Robots","abstract":"In this paper we consider the gathering of oblivious mobile robots in a n-node ring. In this context, the single class of configurations left open in the most recent study [2] is \\(\\mathcal {SP}4\\) (a special class of configurations with only four robots).\nWe present an algorithm to solve some of the most intricate configurations in \\(\\mathcal {SP}4\\), those that can lead to a change of the axis of symmetry. Our approach lays the methodological bases for closing the remaining open cases for \\(\\mathcal {SP}4\\) solvability.","authors":["Fran√ßois Bonnet","Maria Potop-Butucaru","Sebastien Tixeuil"],"meta":["July 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-40509-4_22","Conference: International Conference on Ad-Hoc Networks and Wireless","Projects: Mobile RobotsRobots"],"references":["271737803_Computing_on_Rings_by_Oblivious_Robots_A_Unified_Approach_for_Different_Tasks","230570546_Gathering_an_Even_Number_of_Robots_in_an_Odd_Ring_without_Global_Multiplicity_Detection","220567030_Condition-based_consensus_solvability_A_hierarchy_of_conditions_and_efficient_protocols","220151189_Gathering_asynchronous_oblivious_mobile_robots_in_a_ring","51889618_Asynchronous_Mobile_Robot_Gathering_from_Symmetric_Configurations_without_Global_Multiplicity_Detection","304022567_About_Ungatherability_of_Oblivious_and_Asynchronous_Robots_on_Anonymous_Rings","286485398_Gathering_and_Exclusive_Searching_on_Rings_under_Minimal_Assumptions","274432912_Time-Optimal_Gathering_Algorithm_of_Mobile_Robots_with_Local_Weak_Multiplicity_Detection_in_Rings","274281447_Distributed_Computing_by_Oblivious_Mobile_Robots","271629959_Gathering_on_rings_under_the_Look-Compute-Move_model","265990838_Optimal_Gathering_of_Oblivious_Robots_in_Anonymous_Graphs","261861106_How_to_Gather_Asynchronous_Oblivious_Robots_on_Anonymous_Rings","259162922_Gathering_six_oblivious_robots_on_anonymous_symmetric_rings","220616615_Distributed_Anonymous_Mobile_Robots_Formation_of_Geometric_Patterns","220150906_Taking_Advantage_of_Symmetries_Gathering_of_many_Asynchronous_Oblivious_Robots_on_a_Ring"]}
