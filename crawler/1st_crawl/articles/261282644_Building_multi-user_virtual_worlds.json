{"id":"261282644_Building_multi-user_virtual_worlds","abstract":"Virtual worlds are areas of simulated space that allow first or third person interaction. Interactions can be real-time events or simulations in environments that allow learners to interact with their surroundings, characters, and objects. The focus of this article is the design and development of an academic course on the topic of multi-user virtual worlds. The objective and learning outcome for this course was to build a multi-player virtual game.","authors":["Joseph Defazio","Travis Faas","Rebecca Finch"],"meta":["July 2013","DOI:10.1109/CGames.2013.6632619","Conference: Computer Games: AI, Animation, Mobile, Interactive Multimedia, Educational & Serious Games (CGAMES), 2013 18th International Conference on"],"references":["226777088_Exploring_the_Use_of_Individualized_Reflective_Guidance_In_an_Educational_Multi-User_Virtual_Environment","200025892_Designing_Virtual_Worlds","244486521_Reality_is_Broken_Why_Games_Make_Us_Better_and_How_They_Can_Change_the_World","229996772_The_Effects_of_a_Serious_Game_on_Role-Taking_and_Willingness_to_Help","229713577_Assessing_the_Scholarship_of_Teaching_Valid_Decisions_from_Valid_Evidence","3050920_Teaching_Computer_Science_With_Virtual_Worlds"]}
