{"id":"228446641_Community-based_analysis_of_netflow_for_early_detection_of_security_incidents","abstract":"Detection and remediation of security incidents (e.g., attacks, compromised machines, policy violations) is an increas-ingly important task of system administrators. While numerous tools and techniques are available (e.g., Snort, nmap, netflow), novel attacks and low-grade events may still be hard to detect in a timely manner. In this paper, we present a novel approach for detecting stealthy, low-grade security incidents by utilizing information across a community of organizations (e.g., banking industry, energy generation and distribution industry, govern-mental organizations in a specific country, etc). The approach uses netflow, a commonly available non-intrusive data source, analyzes communication to/from the community, and alerts the community members when suspicious activity is detected. A community-based detection has the ability to detect incidents that would fall below local detection thresholds while maintaining the number of alerts at a manageable level for each day.","authors":["Stefan Weigert","Matti A.
