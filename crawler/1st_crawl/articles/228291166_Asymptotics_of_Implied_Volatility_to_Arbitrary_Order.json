{"id":"228291166_Asymptotics_of_Implied_Volatility_to_Arbitrary_Order","abstract":"In a unified model-free framework that includes long-expiry, short-expiry, extreme-strike, and jointly-varying strike-expiry regimes, we find asymptotic implied volatility and implied variance formulas in terms of L, with rigorous error estimates of order 1/L to any given power, where L denotes the absolute log of an option price that approaches zero. Our results therefore sharpen, to arbitrarily-high order of accuracy, the model-free asymptotics of implied volatility in extreme regimes. We then apply these general formulas to particular examples: Levy and Heston.","authors":["Kun  Gao","Roger  Lee"],"meta":["February 2011Finance and Stochastics 18(2)","DOI:10.2139/ssrn.1768383"],"references":["228600246_Option_pricing_by_transform_methods_extensions_unification_and_error_control","227624090_On_refined_volatility_smile_expansion_in_the_Heston","227255933_Pricing_and_Hedging_in_Exponential_Lvy_Models_Review_of_Recent_Results","220137751_Asymptotic_Formulas_with_Error_Estimates_for_Call_Pricing_Functions_and_the_Implied_Volatility_at_Extreme_Strikes","46462891_Asymptotic_equivalence_in_Lee's_moment_formulas_for_the_implied_volatility_and_Piterbarg's_conjecture","46462824_On_refined_volatility_smile_expansion_in_the_Heston_model","5217237_The_Stop-Loss_Start-Gain_Paradox_and_Option_Valuation_A_New_Decomposition_Into_Intrinsic_and_Time_Value","2331688_The_Variance_Gamma_Process_and_Option_Pricing","284332699_Option_pricing_by_transform_methods_Extensions_unification_and_error_control","228622363_Asymptotics_of_Implied_Volatility_Far_from_Maturity","227723487_Regular_Variation_and_Smile_Asymptotics","227390123_Derivatives_in_Financial_Markets_With_Stochastic_Volatility","220026748_Asymptotics_and_Special_Functions","51961520_The_Small-Maturity_Smile_for_Exponential_Levy_Models","46510952_On_the_Relationship_between_the_Call_Price_Surface_and_the_Implied_Volatility_Surface_Close_to_Expiry","24107394_The_Pricing_of_Options_And_Corporate_Liabilities","5217313_A_Closed-Form_Solution_for_Options_With_Stochastic_Volatility_With_Applications_to_Bond_and_Currency_Options","4776979_The_Moment_Formula_for_Implied_Volatility_at_Extreme_Strikes","2130613_Smile_Asymptotics_II_Models_with_Known_Moment_Generating_Function"]}
