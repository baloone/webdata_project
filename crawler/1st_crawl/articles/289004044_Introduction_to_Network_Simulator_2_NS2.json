{"id":"289004044_Introduction_to_Network_Simulator_2_NS2","abstract":"Introduction to Network Simulator NS2 is a primer providing materials for NS2 beginners, whether students, professors, or researchers for understanding the architecture of Network Simulator 2 (NS2) and for incorporating simulation modules into NS2. The authors discuss the simulation architecture and the key components of NS2 including simulation-related objects, network objects, packet-related objects, and helper objects. The NS2 modules included within are nodes, links, SimpleLink objects, packets, agents, and applications. Further, the book covers three helper modules: timers, random number generators, and error models. Also included are chapters on summary of debugging, variable and packet tracing, result compilation, and examples for extending NS2. Two appendices provide the details of scripting language Tcl, OTcl and AWK, as well object oriented programming used extensively in NS2. Â© 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.
