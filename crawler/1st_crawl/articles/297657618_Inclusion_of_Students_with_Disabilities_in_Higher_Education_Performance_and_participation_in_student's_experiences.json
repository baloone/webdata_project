{"id":"297657618_Inclusion_of_Students_with_Disabilities_in_Higher_Education_Performance_and_participation_in_student's_experiences","abstract":"To expand knowledge on the accessibility of higher education to students with disabilities, the study compared 170 such students in higher education institutions in Israel with 156 students without disabilities for formal achievements and overall participation in higher education. Results revealed that academic achievements of students with disabilities were almost as high as those of students without disabilities, and overall students' experiences were similar. But the two groups of students differed in areas of experiences, as did students with various disabilities among themselves. Analysis of the data indicates that students with disabilities invested more time to meet the demands of their studies, participated in fewer social and extra-curricular activities, and used computers and information technology less. Higher education institutes still have a long way to go to reduce the gap in social inclusion of students with disabilities and to adjust academic standards for their needs.","authors":["Dalia Sachs","Naomi Schreuer"],"meta":["April 2011Disability Studies Quarterly 31(2)","DOI:10.18061/dsq.v31i2.1593"],"references":[]}
