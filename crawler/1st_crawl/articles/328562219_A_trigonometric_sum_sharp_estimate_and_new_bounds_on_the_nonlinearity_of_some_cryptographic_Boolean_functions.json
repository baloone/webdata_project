{"id":"328562219_A_trigonometric_sum_sharp_estimate_and_new_bounds_on_the_nonlinearity_of_some_cryptographic_Boolean_functions","abstract":"In this paper, we give a sharp estimate of a trigonometric sum which has several applications in cryptography and sequence theory. Using this estimate, we deduce new lower bounds on the nonlinearity of Carlet–Feng function, which has very good cryptographic properties with its nonlinearity bound being improved in numerous papers, as well as the function proposed by Tang–Carlet–Tang.","authors":["Qichun Wang","Pante Stănică"],"meta":["August 2019Designs Codes and Cryptography 87(1)","DOI:10.1007/s10623-018-0574-2"],"references":["323524101_New_bounds_on_the_covering_radius_of_the_second_order_Reed-Muller_code_of_length_128","320827824_Construction_of_n-variable_n_2_mod_4_balanced_Boolean_functions_with_maximum_absolute_value_in_autocorrelation_spectra_2n2","318356702_Gowers_U_3_U_3_norm_of_some_classes_of_bent_Boolean_functions","313268375_On_the_covering_radius_of_the_third_order_Reed-Muller_code_RM3_7","288323790_Four_decades_of_research_on_bent_functions","262234576_Perfect_Algebraic_Immune_Functions","302061018_Proof_of_a_conjecture_and_a_bound_on_the_imbalance_properties_of_LFSR_subsequences","286236438_Properties_of_a_Family_of_Cryptographic_Boolean_Functions","285105779_Boolean_Models_and_Methods_in_Mathematics_Computer_Science_and_Engineering","266448506_Covering_Radius_of_the_Reed-Muller_CodeR1_7-A_Simpler_Proof"]}
