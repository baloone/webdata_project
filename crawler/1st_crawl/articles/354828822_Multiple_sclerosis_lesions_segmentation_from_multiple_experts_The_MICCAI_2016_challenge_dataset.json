{"id":"354828822_Multiple_sclerosis_lesions_segmentation_from_multiple_experts_The_MICCAI_2016_challenge_dataset","abstract":"MRI plays a crucial role in multiple sclerosis diagnostic and patient follow-up. In particular, the delineation of T2-FLAIR hyperintense lesions is crucial although mostly performed manually - a tedious task. Many methods have thus been proposed to automate this task. However, sufficiently large datasets with a thorough expert manual segmentation are still lacking to evaluate these methods. We present a unique dataset for MS lesions segmentation evaluation. It consists of 53 patients acquired on 4 different scanners with a harmonized protocol. Hyperintense lesions on FLAIR were manually delineated on each patient by 7 experts with control on T2 sequence, and gathered in a consensus segmentation for evaluation. We provide raw and preprocessed data and a split of the dataset into training and testing data, the latter including data from a scanner not present in the training dataset. We strongly believe that this dataset will become a reference in MS lesions segmentation evaluation, allowing to evaluate many aspects: evaluation of performance on unseen scanner, comparison to individual experts performance, comparison to other challengers who already used this dataset, etc.","authors":["Olivier Commowick","MichaÃ«l Kain","Romain Casey","Roxana Ameli"],"meta":["September 2021NeuroImage 244(10):118589","DOI:10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.118589"],"references":["348946176_The_Open_Brain_Consent_Informing_research_participants_and_obtaining_consent_to_share_brain_imaging_data","329628138_Observatoire_Francais_de_la_Sclerose_en_Plaques_OFSEP_A_unique_multimodal_nationwide_MS_registry_in_France","327603771_Objective_Evaluation_of_Multiple_Sclerosis_Lesion_Segmentation_using_a_Data_Management_and_Processing_Infrastructure","321990229_Diagnosis_of_multiple_sclerosis_2017_revisions_of_the_McDonald_criteria","311821084_Ocrelizumab_versus_Interferon_Beta-1a_in_Relapsing_Multiple_Sclerosis","338962254_New_OFSEP_recommendations_for_MRI_assessment_of_multiple_sclerosis_patients_Special_consideration_for_gadolinium_deposition_and_frequent_acquisitions","323973362_Siponimod_versus_placebo_in_secondary_progressive_multiple_sclerosis_EXPAND_a_double-blind_randomised_phase_3_study","315919891_Nabla-net_A_Deep_Dag-Like_Convolutional_Architecture_for_Biomedical_Image_Segmentation","312199670_Longitudinal_multiple_sclerosis_lesion_segmentation_Resource_and_challenge","311707275_Multiple_Sclerosis_lesion_segmentation_using_an_automated_multimodal_Graph_Cut","311249596_Shanoir_Applying_the_Software_as_a_Service_Distribution_Model_to_Manage_Brain_Imaging_Research_Repositories","309573939_OFSEP_a_nationwide_cohort_of_people_with_multiple_sclerosis_Consensus_minimal_MRI_protocol","282067349_volBrain_An_Online_MRI_Brain_Volumetry_System","272100119_OFSEP_a_nationwide_cohort_of_people_with_multiple_sclerosis_Consensus_minimal_MRI_protocol","310439826_Rating_neurologic_impairment_in_multiple_sclerosis"]}
