{"id":"325018241_The_Location-Routing_Problem_with_Full_Truckloads_in_Low-Carbon_Supply_Chain_Network_Designing","abstract":"In recent years, low-carbon supply chain network design has been the focus of studies as the development of low-carbon economy. The location-routing problem with full truckloads (LRPFT) is investigated in this paper, which extends the existing studies on the LRP to full truckloads problem within the regional many-to-many raw material supply network. A mathematical model with dual objectives of minimizing total cost and environmental effects simultaneously is developed to determine the number and locations of facilities and optimize the flows among different kinds of nodes and routes of trucks as well. A novel multiobjective hybrid approach named NSGA-II-TS is proposed by combining a known multiobjective algorithm, NSGA-II, and a known heuristics, Tabu Search (TS). A chromosome presentation based on natural number and modified partially mapping crossover operator for the LRPFT are designed. Finally, the computational effectiveness of the hybrid approach is validated by the numerical results and a practical case study is applied to demonstrate the tradeoff between total cost and CO 2 emission in the LRPFT.","authors":["Cheng Chen","Rongzu Qiu","Xisheng Hu"],"meta":["May 2018Mathematical Problems in Engineering 2018:1-13","DOI:10.1155/2018/6315631"],"references":["301933770_Hybrid_Multistarting_GA-Tabu_Search_Method_for_the_Placement_of_BtB_Converters_for_Korean_Metropolitan_Ring_Grid","317004518_A_Multi-Objective_Model_for_the_Green_Capacitated_Location-Routing_Problem_Considering_Environmental_Impact","301917635_Hybrid_Genetic_Algorithm_and_Tabu_Search_for_Finite_Capacity_Material_Requirement_Planning_System_in_Flexible_Flow_Shop_with_Assembly_Operations","301352491_Ant_colony_optimization_with_clustering_for_solving_the_dynamic_location_routing_problem","273588087_Hybrid_NSGA-II_Algorithm_on_Multi-objective_Inventory_Management_Problem","269725190_A_joint_location_inventory_problem_with_environmental_Considerations","268694897_A_survey_of_variants_and_extensions_of_the_location-routing_problem","267928610_The_tractor_and_semitrailer_routing_problem_with_many-to-many_demand_considering_carbon_dioxide_emissions","267215817_Optimal_coordination_of_directional_overcurrent_relays_using_NSGA-II","262340930_A_survey_of_recent_research_on_location-routing_problems"]}
