{"id":"329256826_Data-driven_modeling_of_group_entitativity_in_virtual_environments","abstract":"We present a data-driven algorithm to model and predict the socio-emotional impact of groups on observers. Psychological research finds that highly entitative i.e. cohesive and uniform groups induce threat and unease in observers. Our algorithm models realistic trajectory-level behaviors to classify and map the motion-based entitativity of crowds. This mapping is based on a statistical scheme that dynamically learns pedestrian behavior and computes the resultant entitativity induced emotion through group motion characteristics. We also present a novel interactive multi-agent simulation algorithm to model entitative groups and conduct a VR user study to validate the socio-emotional predictive power of our algorithm. We further show that model-generated high-entitativity groups do induce more negative emotions than low-entitative groups.","authors":["Aniket Bera","Tanmay Randhavane","Emily Kubin","Husam Shaik"],"meta":["November 2018","DOI:10.1145/3281505.3281524","Conference: the 24th ACM Symposium"],"references":["324681345_The_effects_of_appearance_and_motion_of_virtual_characters_on_emotional_reactivity","324030021_Effect_of_Virtual_Human_Gaze_Behaviour_During_an_Orthogonal_Collision_Avoidance_Walking_Task","322673843_The_Effect_of_Realistic_Appearance_of_Virtual_Characters_in_Immersive_Environments_-_Does_the_Character's_Personality_Play_a_Role","318830210_Aggressive_Tense_or_Shy_Identifying_Personality_Traits_from_Crowd_Videos","317555764_Walking_with_Virtual_People_Evaluation_of_Locomotion_Interfaces_in_Dynamic_Environments","305027341_Interactive_and_adaptive_data-driven_crowd_simulation","330586747_The_Socially_Invisible_Robot_Navigation_in_the_Social_World_Using_Robot_Entitativity","329743782_Classifying_Group_Emotions_for_Socially-Aware_Autonomous_Vehicle_Navigation","309781031_Using_Groups_to_Measure_Intergroup_Prejudice","303886418_Proxemic_group_behaviors_using_reciprocal_multi-agent_navigation"]}
