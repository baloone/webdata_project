Today, Muslim consumer still faces problem in identifying, verify or recognized Halal products in the market. Time to time technology development in communications has given advantage in deploying the system to solve this issue. Today new technology would be one the advantage in verifying Halal product. This research has presented a system to identify the Halal product by using Smartphone which called MyHalal system. Smartphone scanner, camera and barcode readers are tested. This system is able to verify and recognized the information of products and confirmed their Halal status in real time which has accessibility to its database while they do shopping. It operated on Android 2.1 open source operating system and can be used at higher application programming interface (API) level. This prototype system is novel from others by having detailed information features, large database and enable users to contact directly to product business market. Direct contact features also can be made to the Malaysian Islamic authority department (JAKIM) on recognition the products.
