Secondly, for a simple closed 18-surface M S S 18 , we prove that there are only two types of connected sums of it up to 18-isomorphism. Besides, given a simple closed 6-surface M S S 6 , we prove that only one type of M S S 6 ♯ M S S 6 exists up to 6-isomorphism, where ♯ means the digital connected sum operator. Thirdly, we prove the digital k-contractibility of C k n : = M S S k ♯ ⋯ ♯ M S S k ︷ n - times , k ∈ { 18 , 26 } , which leads to the simply k-connectedness of C k n , k ∈ { 18 , 26 } , n ∈ N . Fourthly, we prove that C 6 2 and C k n do not have the almost fixed point property (AFPP, for short), k ∈ { 18 , 26 } . Finally, assume a closed k-surface S k ( ⊂ Z 3 ) which is ( k , k ¯ ) -isomorphic to ( X , k ) in the picture ( Z 3 , k , k ¯ , X ) and the set X is symmetric according to each of x y -, y z -, and x z -planes of R 3 . Then we prove that S k does not have the AFPP. In this paper given a digital image ( X , k ) is assumed to be k-connected and its cardinality | X | ≥ 2 .","authors":["Sang-Eon Han"],"meta":["March 2020","DOI:10.3390/math8030345"],"references":["337981197_Fixed_Point_Theory_for_Digital_k-Surfaces_and_Some_Remarks_on_the_Euler_Characteristics_of_Digital_Closed_Surfaces","337091927_Topologies_on_Zn_that_Are_Not_Homeomorphic_to_the_n-Dimensional_Khalimsky_Topological_Space","336523336_Remarks_on_the_Preservation_of_the_Almost_Fixed_Point_Property_Involving_Several_Types_of_Digitizations","335980448_The_Fixed_Point_Property_of_Non-Retractable_Topological_Spaces","325010461_A_NEW_SURVEY_CONE_METRIC_SPACES","320556098_Computers_and_Mathematics_with_Applications_Fixed_point_theorem_for_two_non-self_mappings_in_cone_metric_spaces","318671614_Multiprojective_spaces_and_the_arithmetically_Cohen-Macaulay_property","338519995_Jordan_surface_theorem_for_simple_closed_SST-surfaces","329131107_Estimation_of_the_complexity_of_a_digital_image_from_the_viewpoint_of_fixed_point_theory","324461217_Digital_Topology"]}
