{"id":"254340106_Faculty_Research_Productivity_and_Standardized_Student_Learning_Outcomes_in_a_University_Teaching_Environment_A_Bayesian_Analysis_of_Relationships","abstract":"This study examines whether faculty research productivity is associated with student learning. Unlike previous studies that define learning by student evaluations of teaching effectiveness, the authors specifically measure teaching effectiveness by a standardized student learning outcome measure developed by a School of Business at a US university. Using a Bayesian data reduction algorithm and regression techniques, it was found that faculty research activity is positively and significantly related to teaching effectiveness.","authors":["Craig S.
