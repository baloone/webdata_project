{"id":"262997353_The_birth_of_spacetime_atoms_as_the_passage_of_time","abstract":"In the following discussion I suggest that the reason there is no consensus on whether the passage of time is physical is that our current best theory of spacetime, general relativity, lacks such a concept. This means that the sense-experience of passage, appealed to by those who claim it is physical, cannot be properly expressed: it is not even a fact. I draw attention to work in the literature on a model of a growing, granular spacetime--arising within a proposed theory of quantum spacetime called causal set theory--that does contain the concept of passage as the coming into being or birth of atoms of spacetime. I present an example from the history of science of a sense-experience that cannot be understood within one theory but is revealed to be an important fact within a better successor theory.","authors":["Fay Dowker"],"meta":["April 2014Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences 1326(1)","DOI:10.1111/nyas.12542"],"references":["1977918_A_Classical_Sequential_Growth_Dynamics_for_Causal_Sets","1965800_Observables_in_causal_set_cosmology","1964996_General_Covariance_and_the_Problem_of_Time_in_a_Discrete_Cosmology","313002514_Autobiographical_notes","288490969_The_Lagrangian_in_quantum_mechanics","282257441_Time_Really_Passes","264859622_A_new_topology_for_curved_space-time_which_incorporates_the_causal_differential_and_conformal_structures","253263125_On_the_Entropy_of_the_Vacuum_Outside_a_Horizon","252341954_Linkages_in_general_relativity","248962093_Reassessing_the_Prospects_for_a_Growing_Block_Model_of_the_Universe","243387504_General_Relativity_from_A_to_B","234891680_The_class_of_continuous_timelike_curves_determines_the_topology_of_spacetime","231948719_On_the_structure_of_causal_spaces","30768893_A_new_topology_for_curved_space-time_which_incorporates_the_causal_differential_and_conformal_structures","13253679_Space-time_as_a_causal_set","1973262_Quantum_Mechanics_as_Quantum_Measure_Theory","1972688_Relativity_Theory_Does_Not_Imply_that_the_Future_Already_Exists_A_Counterexample","1966978_Causal_Sets_Discrete_Gravity_Notes_for_the_Valdivia_Summer_School"]}
