{"id":"330032108_Existence_and_global_exponential_stability_of_anti-periodic_solution_for_Clifford-valued_inertial_Cohen-Grossberg_neural_networks_with_delays","abstract":"In this paper, we are concerned with a class of Clifford-valued inertial Cohen-Grossberg neural networks with time-varying delays. Based on the coincidence degree theory and the Wirtinger inequality, we first obtain sufficient conditions ensuring the existence of anti-periodic solutions for this class of networks. Then, by constructing a suitable Lyapunov functional, we establish the global exponential stability of the anti-periodic solutions. Our results are completely new even if the considered neural networks degenerate into real-valued, complex-valued or quaternion-valued. Finally, we present a numerical example to show the effectiveness of our results","authors":["Yongkun Li","Jianglian Xiang"],"meta":["December 2018Neurocomputing 332(2)","DOI:10.1016/j.neucom.2018.12.064"],"references":["325511631_Anti-periodic_Solutions_for_Quaternion-Valued_High-Order_Hopfield_Neural_Networks_with_Time-Varying_Delays","324826645_Global_asymptotical_stability_for_a_class_of_non-autonomous_impulsive_inertial_neural_networks_with_unbounded_time-varying_delay","305517390_Anti-periodic_Solutions_of_Inertial_Neural_Networks_with_Time_Delays","301313135_Anti-periodic_solutions_for_state-dependent_impulsive_recurrent_neural_networks_with_time-varying_and_continuously_distributed_delays","299364660_Global_stability_of_Clifford-valued_recurrent_neural_networks_with_time_delays","225169754_Power_processing_circuits_for_electromagnetic_electrostatic_and_piezoelectric_inertial_energy_scavengers","8328275_Robust_Global_Exponential_Stability_of_Cohen-Grossberg_Neural_Networks_With_Time_Delays","326472582_Fixed-time_synchronization_of_coupled_Cohen-Grossberg_neural_networks_with_and_without_parameter_uncertainties","325919214_New_conditions_for_global_stability_of_neutral-type_delayed_Cohen-Grossberg_neural_networks","325588619_Quantized_Sampled-Data_Control_for_Synchronization_of_Inertial_Neural_Networks_With_Heterogeneous_Time-Varying_Delays","321820653_Stability_Analysis_of_Inertial_Cohen-Grossberg_Neural_Networks_with_Markovian_Jumping_Parameters","321163530_Global_exponential_stability_of_memristive_Cohen-Grossberg_neural_networks_with_mixed_delays_and_impulse_time_window","320957151_New_results_on_global_exponential_dissipativity_analysis_of_memristive_inertial_neural_networks_with_distributed_time-varying_delays","319568706_On_anti-periodic_solutions_for_neutral_shunting_inhibitory_cellular_neural_networks_with_time-varying_delays_and_D_operator","319231858_Matrix_measure_based_exponential_stabilization_for_complex-valued_inertial_neural_networks_with_time-varying_delays_using_impulsive_control","315637183_Global_convergence_analysis_of_impulsive_inertial_neural_networks_with_time-varying_delays","312144651_Global_Lagrange_stability_for_inertial_neural_networks_with_mixed_time-varying_delays","310824391_Discontinuous_Observers_Design_for_Finite-Time_Consensus_of_Multiagent_Systems_With_External_Disturbances","282398190_Global_exponential_stability_of_Clifford-valued_recurrent_neural_networks","270994842_Anti-periodic_solution_for_impulsive_BAM_neural_networks_with_time-varying_leakage_delays_on_time_scales","268690823_The_existence_and_stability_of_the_anti-periodic_solution_for_delayed_Cohen-Grossberg_neural_networks_with_impulsive_effects","264937744_A_Micro_Inertial_Energy_Harvesting_Platform_With_Self-Supplied_Power_Management_Circuit_for_Autonomous_Wireless_Sensor_Nodes","263049074_Neural_network_for_solving_Nash_equilibrium_problem_in_application_of_multiuser_power_control","260840968_Matrix_measure_strategies_for_stability_and_synchronization_of_inertial_BAM_neural_network_with_time_delays","257352625_Stability_analysis_of_inertial_Cohen-Grossberg-type_neural_networks_with_time_delays","257352385_Stability_analysis_of_reaction-diffusion_Cohen-Grossberg_neural_networks_under_impulsive_control","257351841_Bogdanov-Takens_bifurcation_in_a_single_inertial_neuron_model_with_delay","257190675_Global_stability_analysis_of_Cohen-Grossberg_neural_networks_with_time_varying_delays_rapid_communication","251678642_Antiperiodic_solution_for_delayed_cellular_neural_networks_with_impulsive_effects","251635153_Antiperiodic_solutions_to_impulsive_shunting_inhibitory_cellular_neural_networks_with_distributed_delays_on_time_scales","247603793_Models_for_Electrical_Tuning_in_Hair_Cells","232516165_Absolute_Stability_of_Global_Pattern_Formation_and_Parallel_Memory_Storage_by_Competitive_Neural_Networks","223921969_Geometric_preprocessing_geometric_feedforward_neural_networks_and_Clifford_support_vector_machines_for_visual_learning","222680579_Harmless_delays_in_Cohen-Grossberg_neural_networks","222591614_On_Clifford_neurons_and_Clifford_multi-layer_perceptrons","222293618_Existence_and_stability_of_periodic_solutions_for_Cohen-Grossberg_neural_networks_with_multiple_delays","222273134_Anti-periodic_solutions_for_Cohen-Grossberg_neural_networks_with_bounded_and_unbounded_delays","220551620_Stability_and_existence_of_periodic_solutions_to_delayed_CohenCGrossberg_BAM_neural_networks_with_impulses_on_time_scales","51727886_Passivity_and_Stability_Analysis_of_Reaction-Diffusion_Neural_Networks_With_Dirichlet_Boundary_Conditions","21278397_Models_of_membrane_resonance_in_pigeon_semicircular_canal_type_II_hair_cells"]}
