{"id":"270277039_Artificial_Neural_Network_ANN_Model_for_Predicting_Students'_Academic_Performance","abstract":"The observed poor quality of graduates of some Nigerian Universities in recent times is traceable to non-availability of mechanism that would enable the University administrators to project into the future performance of the concerned students. This will guarantee the provision of better educational services as well as customize assistance according to studentsâ€™ predicted level of performance. In this research, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) were used to develop a model for predicting the final grade of a university student before graduating such student. The data used in this study consists of thirty (30) randomly selected students in the Department of Computer Science, Tai Solarin University of Education in Ogun State, who have completed four academic sessions from the university. Test data evaluation showed that the ANN model is able to correctly predict the final grade of students with 92.7% accuracy.","authors":["Usman Opeyemi Lateef","Ademola Adenubi"],"meta":["June 2014"],"references":["229486976_Electricity_consumption_in_Nigeria_a_Spatial_Analysis","228526441_Predicting_Students_Academic_Performance_using_Artificial_Neural_Network_A_Case_Study_of_an_Engineering_Course","284024404_Training_feed_forward_network_with_the_Marquardt_algorithm","258051743_Time_series_analysis_Forecasting_and_control_Rev_ed","246971303_Nonlinear_Time_Series_A_Dynamical_Approach","241168511_Study_on_Power_Energy_Consumption_Model_for_Large-Scale_Public_Building","232388174_Effect_of_length_of_measurement_period_on_accuracy_of_predicted_annual_heating_energy_consumption_of_buildings","225144510_A_Logical_Calculus_of_the_Idea_Immanent_in_Nervous_Activity","224982370_Neural_Networks_-_A_Comprehensive_Foundation","224982284_A_logical_Calculus_of_Ideas_Immanent_in_Nervous_Activity"]}
