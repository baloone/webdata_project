{"id":"331612826_Breaking_All_the_Things-A_Systematic_Survey_of_Firmware_Extraction_Techniques_for_IoT_Devices_Studies_on_Socio-Ecological_Systems'_Vulnerability_Resilience_and_Governance","abstract":"In this paper, we systematically review and categorize different hardware-based firmware extraction techniques, using 24 examples of real, wide-spread products, e.g. smart voice assistants (in particular Amazon Echo devices), alarm and access control systems, as well as home automation devices. We show that in over 45% of the cases, an exposed UART interface is sufficient to obtain a firmware dump, while in other cases, more complicated, yet still low-cost methods (e.g. JTAG or eMMC readout) are needed. In this regard, we perform an in-depth investigation of the security concept of the Amazon Echo Plus, which contains significant protection methods against hardware-level attacks. Based on the results of our study, we give recommendations for countermeasures to mitigate the respective methods.","authors":["Sebastian Vasile","David Oswald","Tom Chothia"],"meta":["January 2019","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-15462-2_12","In book: Climate Change and Coastal Resources in Tanzania (pp.171-185)"],"references":["333032511_Shedding_too_much_Light_on_a_Microcontroller's_Firmware_Protection","278763280_A_Large-Scale_Analysis_of_the_Security_of_Embedded_Firmwares","264124586_Microcontrollers_as_InSecurity_Devices_for_Pervasive_Computing_Applications","261075256_A_Systemic_Approach_for_IoT_Security","258129432_When_Firmware_Modifications_Attack_A_Case_Study_of_Embedded_Exploitation","322709260_Opening_Pandora's_Box_Effective_Techniques_for_Reverse_Engineering_IoT_Devices","319071993_Stringer_Measuring_the_Importance_of_Static_Data_Comparisons_to_Detect_Backdoors_and_Undocumented_Functionality","318145203_HumIDIFy_A_Tool_for_Hidden_Functionality_Detection_in_Firmware","286668583_IoT_Security_Ongoing_Challenges_and_Research_Opportunities","259166687_Firmware_modification_attacks_on_programmable_logic_controllers","246353054_Hacking_the_Xbox_an_introduction_to_reverse_engineering"]}
