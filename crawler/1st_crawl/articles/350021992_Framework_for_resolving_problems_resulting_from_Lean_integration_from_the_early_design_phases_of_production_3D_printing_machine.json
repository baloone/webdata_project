{"id":"350021992_Framework_for_resolving_problems_resulting_from_Lean_integration_from_the_early_design_phases_of_production_3D_printing_machine","abstract":"We focus on improving the performance of production machines (time-saving, flexibility, cost-effectiveness, safety) from the early design phase.\nLean integration during the design phases might be a more appropriate solution, but this could be a source of some contradictions related to the machine performance and the usage requirements.\nIn this paper, we propose an approach, based on Lean and Inventive Design Methodology (IDM-TRIZ), to identify and resolve these contradictions due to the Lean integration and also to provide innovative technical solutions.\nThe approach is illustrated by the integration of the functionalities of the ''Single Minute of Exchange of Dies'' (SMED) and the ''5S'' method from the early design phase. A case study about the ''3D printer clogged nozzle'' outlines the feasibility of the proposed approach.","authors":["Rabih Slim","R.
