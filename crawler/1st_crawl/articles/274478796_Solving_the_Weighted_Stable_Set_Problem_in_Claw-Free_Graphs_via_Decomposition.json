{"id":"274478796_Solving_the_Weighted_Stable_Set_Problem_in_Claw-Free_Graphs_via_Decomposition","abstract":"We propose an algorithm for solving the maximum weighted stable set problem on claw-free graphs that runs in O(|V|(|E|+|V| log |V|))-time, drastically improving the previous best known complexity bound. This algorithm is based on a novel decomposition theorem for claw-free graphs, which is also introduced in the present article. Despite being weaker than the structural results for claw-free graphs given by Chudnovsky and Seymour [2005, 2008a, 2008b] our decomposition theorem is, on the other hand, algorithmic, that is, it is coupled with an O(|V||E|)-time algorithm that actually produces the decomposition.","authors":["Yuri Faenza","Gianpaolo Oriolo","Gautier Stauffer"],"meta":["July 2014Journal of the ACM 61(4):1-41","DOI:10.1145/2629600"],"references":["233381555_Minimum_Weighted_Clique_Cover_on_Strip-Composed_Perfect_Graphs","220481202_A_Local_Strengthening_of_Reed's_omega_Delta_chi_Conjecture_for_Quasi-line_Graphs","220441760_The_stable_set_polytope_of_quasi-line_graphs","47860611_Domination_When_the_Stars_Are_Out","38437772_Claw-free_graphs_and_two_conjectures_on_omega_Delta_and_chi","344709727_The_structure_of_claw-free_graphs","318285317_A_REVISION_OF_MINTY'S_ALGORITHM_FOR_FINDING_A_MAXIMUM_WEIGHT_STABLE_SET_OF_A_CLAW-FREE_GRAPH","313002179_The_structure_of_claw-free_graphs","287012350_Demonstration_nouvelle_d'une_theoreme_de_Whitney_sur_les_reseaux","268642744_Combinatorial_optimization_Polyhedra_and_efficiency_3_volumes","267466546_A_maxmn_algorithm_for_determining_the_graph_H_from_its_line_graph_G","263525911_A_revision_of_Minty's_algorithm_for_finding_a_maximum_weight_stable_set_of_a_claw-free_graph","262282699_k-shredders_in_k-connected_graphs","261702736_Claw-Free_Graphs_Skeletal_Graphs_and_a_Stronger_Conjecture_on_o_D_and_ch","256935855_Claw-free_graphs_VII_Quasi-line_graphs","256935687_A_Strengthening_of_Ben_Rebea's_Lemma","254973976_Bounding_in_terms_of_and_for_quasi-line_graphs","242499241_Maximum_matching_and_a_polyhedron_with_01-vertices","227727152_Bounding_ch_in_terms_of_o_and_D_for_quasi-line_graphs","226670926_On_Clique_Separators_Nearly_Chordal_Graphs_and_the_Maximum_Weight_Stable_Set_Problem","222608918_On_claw-free_asteroidal_triple-free_graphs","222183106_Algorithme_de_recherche_d'un_stable_de_cardinalite_maximum_dans_un_graphe_sans_etoile","221394825_A_reduction_algorithm_for_the_weighted_stable_set_problem_in_claw-free_graphs","221316935_On_Clique_Separators_Nearly_Chordal_Graphs_and_the_Maximum_Weight_Stable_Set_Problem","221316913_A_New_Algorithm_for_the_Maximum_Weighted_Stable_Set_Problem_in_Claw-Free_Graphs","221316762_Formulations_for_the_stable_set_polytope_of_a_claw-free_graph","220780456_Data_Structures_for_Weighted_Matching_and_Nearest_Common_Ancestors_with_Linking","220690835_Network_Flows_Theory_Algorithms_and_Applications","220568107_On_linear_and_circular_structure_of_claw_net-free_graphs","220112765_Finding_and_counting_small_induced_subgraphs_efficiently","220076101_Claw-free_graphs_IV_Decomposition_theorem","220074855_Claw-free_graphs_V_Global_structure","220074814_On_maximal_independent_sets_of_vertices_in_claw-free_graphs","51887463_On_the_Recognition_of_Fuzzy_Circular_Interval_Graphs","50908775_Finding_a_smallest_odd_hole_in_a_claw-free_graph_using_global_structure","48202032_Asymptotics_of_the_Chromatic_Number_for_Quasi-Line_Graphs"]}
