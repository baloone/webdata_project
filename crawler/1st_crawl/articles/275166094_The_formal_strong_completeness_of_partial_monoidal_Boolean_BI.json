{"id":"275166094_The_formal_strong_completeness_of_partial_monoidal_Boolean_BI","abstract":"This article presents a self-contained proof of the strong completeness of the labelled tableaux method for partial monoidal\nBoolean BI: if a formula has no tableau proof then there exists a counter-model for it which is simple. Simple counter-models are those\nwhich are generated from the specific constraints that occur during the tableaux proof-search process. As a companion to this\narticle, we provide a complete formalization of this result in Coq and discuss some of its implementation details.
