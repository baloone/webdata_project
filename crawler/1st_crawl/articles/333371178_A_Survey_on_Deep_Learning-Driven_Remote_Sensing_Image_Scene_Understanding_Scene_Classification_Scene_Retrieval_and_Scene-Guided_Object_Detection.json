{"id":"333371178_A_Survey_on_Deep_Learning-Driven_Remote_Sensing_Image_Scene_Understanding_Scene_Classification_Scene_Retrieval_and_Scene-Guided_Object_Detection","abstract":"As a fundamental and important task in remote sensing, remote sensing image scene understanding (RSISU) has attracted tremendous research interest in recent years. RSISU includes the following sub-tasks: remote sensing image scene classification, remote sensing image scene retrieval, and scene-driven remote sensing image object detection. Although these sub-tasks have different goals, they share some communal hints. Hence, this paper tries to discuss them as a whole. Similar to other domains (e.g., speech recognition and natural image recognition), deep learning has also become the state-of-the-art technique in RSISU. To facilitate the sustainable progress of RSISU, this paper presents a comprehensive review of deep-learning-based RSISU methods, and points out some future research directions and potential applications of RSISU.","authors":["Yating Gu","Yantian Wang","Yansheng Li"],"meta":["May 2019Applied Sciences 9(10)","DOI:10.3390/app9102110","Project: High-Resolution Remote Sensing Image Scene Classification"],"references":["338546929_PatternNet_A_benchmark_dataset_for_performance_evaluation_of_remote_sensing_image_retrieval","331702917_Toward_Content-Based_Hyperspectral_Remote_Sensing_Image_Retrieval_CB-HRSIR_A_Preliminary_Study_Based_on_Spectral_Sensitivity_Functions","331484986_High-Resolution_Remote_Sensing_Image_Retrieval_Based_on_CNNs_from_a_Dimensional_Perspective","330819552_A_Fast_Sparse_Coding_Method_for_Image_Classification","328928373_A_Novel_Discriminating_and_Relative_Global_Spatial_Image_Representation_with_Applications_in_CBIR","328990783_Deep_Metric_and_Hash-Code_Learning_for_Content-Based_Retrieval_of_Remote_Sensing_Images","328989723_Deep_Semantic_Hashing_Retrieval_of_Remotec_Sensing_Images","328985413_AID_An_Updated_Version_of_AID_on_Scene_Classification","328803599_Enhanced_Interactive_Remote_Sensing_Image_Retrieval_with_Scene_Classification_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_Model","328577443_Automatic_Extraction_of_Built-Up_Areas_From_Panchromatic_and_Multispectral_Remote_Sensing_Images_Using_Double-Stream_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks"]}
