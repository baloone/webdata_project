{"id":"283322343_BETWEEN_MATHEMATICS_AND_TALMUD_-_THE_CONSTRUCTION_OF_A_HYBRID_DISCOURSE_IN_AN_ULTRA-ORTHODOX_CLASSROOM","abstract":"This paper examines the case of adult ultra-orthodox Jews studying algebra for the first time, in a pre-college course. First, the social context and Talmudic background of the students is presented. Then, we analyse how cultural resources from both the Talmudic studies, the main practice of ultra-orthodox culture, and the mathematics classroom culture, were used by students to construct a new hybrid discourse. We conclude by discussing how our analysis demonstrates some productive possibilities and potential problems for the students' mathematical learning.","authors":["Einat Heyd-Metzuyanim","Nadav Ehrenfeld","Uri Onn"],"meta":["July 2015","Conference: PME 39At: Hobart, Australia"],"references":["309520247_Discussing_Argumentative_Texts_as_a_Traditional_Jewish_Learning_Practice","281665057_Thinking_as_communicating_Human_development_the_growth_of_discourses_and_mathematizing","257557378_The_co-construction_of_learning_difficulties_in_mathematics-teacher-student_interactions_and_their_role_in_the_development_of_a_disabled_mathematical_identity","250890308_A_Relational_Perspective_on_Issues_of_Cultural_Diversity_and_Equity_as_They_Play_Out_in_the_Mathematics_Classroom","248451880_Traditions_of_dispute_From_negotiations_of_talmudic_texts_to_the_arena_of_political_discourse_in_the_media","242177845_Telling_Identities_In_Search_of_an_Analytic_Tool_for_Investigating_Learning_as_a_Culturally_Shaped_Activity","238661684_Low-Performing_Students_and_Teaching_Fractions_for_Understanding_An_Interactional_Analysis","288384003_Language_knowledge_and_authority_in_school_mathematics","269459431_When_the_Problem_Is_Not_the_Question_and_the_Solution_Is_Not_the_Answer_Mathematical_Knowing_and_Teaching","260356285_Promises_and_Problems_of_Teaching_With_Popular_Culture_A_Linguistic_Ethnographic_Analysis_of_Discourse_Genre_Mixing_in_a_Literacy_Lesson"]}
