{"id":"271913967_Optimization_of_microwave_assisted_extraction_MAE_and_soxhlet_extraction_of_phenolic_compound_from_licorice_root","abstract":"In present study, response surface methodology was used to optimize extraction condition of phenolic compounds from licorice root by microwave application. Investigated factors were solvent (ethanol 80 %, methanol 80 % and water), liquid/solid ratio (10:1–25:1) and time (2–6 min). Experiments were designed according to the central composite rotatable design. The results showed that extraction conditions had significant effect on the extraction yield of phenolic compounds and antioxidant capacities. Optimal condition in microwave assisted method were ethanol 80 % as solvent, extraction time of 5–6 min and liquid/solid ratio of 12.7/1. Results were compared with those obtained by soxhlet extraction. In soxhlet extraction, Optimum conditions were extraction time of 6 h for ethanol 80 % as solvent. Value of phenolic compounds and extraction yield of licorice root in microwave assisted (MAE), and soxhlet were 47.47 mg/g and 16.38 %, 41.709 mg/g and 14.49 %, respectively. These results implied that MAE was more efficient extracting method than soxhlet.","authors":["Zohreh Karami","Zahra Emam-Djomeh","Habib Allah Mirzaee","Morteza Khomeiri"],"meta":["April 2014Journal of Food Science and Technology -Mysore- 52(6)","DOI:10.1007/s13197-014-1384-9","Project: Evaluation of antioxidant and antimicrobial effect of licorice root extract and its application in soft drink formulation"],"references":["285706600_Optimisation_of_extraction_conditions_for_phenolic_compounds_from_limau_purut_Citrus_hystrix_peels","254261278_Antioxidant_activity_of_extracts_from_foxtail_millet_Setaria_italica","251279232_Effects_of_processing_conditions_on_the_stability_of_polyphenolic_contents_and_antioxidant_capacity_of_Dolichos_lablab_L","237218276_Microwave_Assisted_Extraction_-_An_Innovative_and_Promising_Extraction_Tool_for_Medicinal_Plant_Research","236189429_Analysis_of_conditions_for_microwave-assisted_extraction_of_total_water-soluble_flavonoids_from_Perilla_Frutescens_leaves","223653032_Application_of_microwave-assisted_extraction_to_the_fast_extraction_of_plant_phenolic_compounds","215601007_Optimization_of_acid_hydrolysis_conditions_of_delimed_tannery_by_response_surface_methodology","312622662_Analytical-scale_microwave-assisted_extraction","307815735_Study_of_Microwave_Extraction_of_Essential_Oil_Constituents_from_Plant_Materials","286783413_Antioxidant_determination_by_use_of_stable_free_radicals","279894621_Study_of_microwave_process_of_essential_oil_constituents_from_plant_materials","270066467_Sunflower_Oil_Stabilization_by_Persian_Walnut_Leaves_Extract_during_Oven_Storage_Test","259725994_The_free_radical_scavenging_and_antioxidant_activities_of_pod_and_seed_extract_of_Clitoria_fairchildiana_Howard-_An_underutilized_legume","244323647_Microwave-assisted_extraction_of_tea_polyphenols_and_tea_caffeine_from_green_tea_leaves","238388988_Microwave-Assisted_Extraction_of_the_Fungal_Metabolite_Ergosterol_and_Total_Fatty_Acids","232784476_Antioxidant_Determinations_by_the_Use_of_a_Stable_Free_Radical","231555668_Microwave-Assisted_Extraction_of_Taxanes_from_Taxus_Biomass","229417588_Microwave-assisted_extraction_of_phenolic_antioxidant_compounds_from_peanut_skins","228772325_An_Overview_of_Microwave_Processing_and_Dielectric_Properties_of_Agri-Food_Materials","227605141_The_application_of_response_surface_methodology_to_the_production_of_phenolic_extracts_of_lemon_grass_galangal_holy_basil_and_rosemary","227604379_Process_optimisation_of_encapsulated_pandan_Pandanus_amaryllifolius_Powder_Using_Spray-drying_Method","227027554_Antioxidant_activity_and_free_radical_scavenging_capacity_of_phenolic_extracts_from_Helicteres_isora_L_and_Ceiba_pentandra_L","223941900_Microwave-assisted_extraction_of_glycyrrhizic_acid_from_licorice_root","223906618_Screening_optimization_and_validation_of_microwave-assisted_extraction_for_the_determination_of_persistent_organochlorine_pesticides","223707445_Microwave-assisted_extraction_used_for_the_isolation_of_total_triterpenoid_saponins_from_Ganoderma_atrum","223339032_Microwave-assisted_extraction_of_effective_constituents_from_a_Chinese_herbal_medicine_Radix_puerariae","223292065_Fire_safety_among_the_elderly_in_Western_Australia","223232766_Extraction_of_phenolic_compounds_from_elder_berry_and_different_grape_marc_varieties_organic_solvents_andor_supercritical_carbon_dioxide","222425500_A_novel_process_for_extraction_of_natural_sweetener_from_licorice_Glycyrrhiza_glabra_roots","222371668_The_Effect_of_Microwave_Heating_of_Fresh_Orange_Peels_on_the_Fruit_Tissue_and_Quality_of_Extracted_Pectin","222221379_Determination_of_total_phenolic_and_flavonoid_contents_in_selected_fruits_and_vegetables_as_well_as_their_stimulatory_effects_on_mouse_splenocyte_proliferation","222052430_Effect_of_gamma_irradiation_on_the_antimicrobial_and_free_radical_scavenging_activities_of_Glycyrrhiza_glabra_root","43047891_Apoptosis_of_NB4_cells_induced_by_Tanshinone_II_A_combined_with_arsenic_trioxide","21404025_Effect_of_Oral_Administration_of_Glycyrrhizin_on_the_Pharmacokinetics_of_Prednisolone","14854035_A_preliminary_open_trial_on_interferon_stimulator_SNMC_derived_from_Glycyrrhiza_glabra_in_the_treatment_of_subacute_hepatic_failure","12139218_Analytical-scale_microwave-assisted_extraction","7438050_Ginsenoside_extraction_from_Panax_quinquefolium_L_American_ginseng_root_by_using_ultrahigh_pressure","6867843_Microwave-assisted_extraction_of_solanesol_from_tobacco_leaves","6420148_Evaluation_of_surfactant_assisted_pressurized_liquid_extraction_for_the_determination_of_glycyrrhizin_and_ephedrine_in_medicinal_plants"]}
