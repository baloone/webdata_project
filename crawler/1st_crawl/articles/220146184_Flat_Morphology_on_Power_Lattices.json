{"id":"220146184_Flat_Morphology_on_Power_Lattices","abstract":"Flat morphological operators, also called stack filters, are the natural extension of increasing set operators to grey-level images. The latter are usually modeled as functions \\({E\\rightarrow T}\\), where T is a closed subset of \\({\\boldmath {\\rm \\bar R}}\\) (for instance, \\({\\boldmath {\\rm {\\overline{Z}}}}\\) or [a,b]).\nWe give here a general theory of flat morphological operators for functions defined on a space E of points and taking their values in an arbitrary complete lattice V of values. Several examples of such lattices have been considered in the litterature, and we illustrate our therory with them. Our approach relies on the usual techniques of thresholding and stacking. Some of the usual properties of flat operators for numerical functions extend unconditionally to this general framework. Others do not, unless the lattice V is completely distributive.","authors":["Christian Ronse"],"meta":["November 2006Journal of Mathematical Imaging and Vision 26(1-2):185-216","DOI:10.1007/s10851-006-8304-1","SourceDBLP"],"references":["237073699_Continuous_Lattices_and_Domains","223649428_Idempotent_and_co-idempotent_stack_filters_and_min-max_operators","220932183_Spatio-Temporal_Segmentation_Using_3D_Morphological_Tools","220359307_On_the_Idempotency_and_Co-idempotency_of_the_Morphological_Center","220146315_Morphology_on_Label_Images_Flat-Type_Operators_and_Connections","220146075_Multiscale_Connected_Operators","5595715_Morphological_operators_on_the_unit_circle","3326322_Flat_Zones_Filtering_Connected_Operators_and_Filters_by_Reconstruction","3191778_Threshold_Superposition_in_Morphological_Image_Analysis_Systems","3178433_Morphological_filters_-_part_II_their_relations_to_median_order-statistics_and_stack_filters_IEEE_Trans_Acoust_Speech_Signal_Process","3178064_Stack_filters","337716002_Mathematical_Morphology_on_Complete_Semilattices_and_its_Applications_to_Image_Processing","321620248_Geometry_Morphology_and_Computational_Imaging_11th_International_Workshop_on_Theoretical_Foundations_of_Computer_Vision_Dagstuhl_Castle_Germany_April_7-12_2002_Revised_Papers","319978827_Completely_distributive_complete_lattices","289928413_Digital_video_interfaces","274801291_Image_Analysis_Using_Mathematical_Morphology","268161559_Mathematical_Morphology_From_Theory_to_Applications","257823473_Inf-Semilattice_Approach_to_Self-Dual_Morphology","254891979_From_binary_to_grey-level_morphology","249960142_MATHEMATICAL_MORPHOLOGY_ALMOST_EVERYWHERE","246417453_Image_Analysis_and_Mathematical_Morphobgy","243785319_Morphological_Image_Analysis-Principles_and_Applications","243109700_Darstellungen_und_Erweiterungen_geordneter_Mengen_I","243109677_Darstellungen_und_Erweiterungen_geordneter_Mengen_II","239031108_A_Compendium_of_Continuous_Lattices","234286123_Morphological_Image_Operators","231875405_Which_distributive_lattices_are_lattices_of_closed_sets","230838009_Image_Analysis_and_Mathematical_Morphology_-_Volume_I","230837985_Anamorphoses_and_Function_Lattices_Multivalued_Morphology","230837933_Connected_operators_and_pyramids","228754401_Extension_of_morphological_operations_to_complete_semilattices_and_its_applications_to_image_and_video_processing","227249959_An_overview_of_morphological_filtering","225454859_Flat_Morphological_Operators_on_Arbitrary_Power_Lattices","225195209_Locality_and_Adjacency_Stability_Constraints_for_Morphological_Connected_Operators","223695125_Threshold_Decomposition_of_Gray-Scale_Soft_Morphology_into_Binary_Soft_Morphology","223607936_Why_mathematical_mophology_needs_complete_lattices","222889573_Theoretical_aspects_of_morphological_filters_by_reconstruction","222742274_Order-configuration_functions_Mathematical_characterizations_and_applications_to_digital_signal_and_image_processing","221678030_Digital_Video_and_HDTVAlgorithms_and_Interfaces","220690424_Fuzzy_Mathematical_Models_in_Engineering_and_Management_Science","220632595_The_algebraic_basis_of_mathematical_morphology_I_Dilations_and_erosions","220443672_Mathematical_Morphology_on_Complete_Semilattices_and_its_Applications_to_Image_Processing","220181640_Threshold_Decomposition_of_Gray-Scale_Morphology_into_Binary_Morphology","35052815_Completely_Distributive_Complete_Lattices","5585515_Annular_filters_for_binary_images","3315749_Processors_for_generalized_stack_filters","3191913_Theoretical_aspects_of_gray-level_morphology"]}
