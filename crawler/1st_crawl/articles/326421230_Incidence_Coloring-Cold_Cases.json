{"id":"326421230_Incidence_Coloring-Cold_Cases","abstract":"An incidence in a graph G is a pair (v, e) where v is a vertex of G and e is an edge of G incident to v. Two incidences (v, e) and (u, f) are adjacent if at least one of the following holds: (i) v = u, (ii) e = f, or (iii) edge vu is from the set {e, f}. An incidence coloring of G is a coloring of its incidences assigning distinct colors to adjacent incidences. The minimum number of colors needed for incidence coloring of a graph is called the incidence chromatic number.","authors":["František Kardoš","Mária Maceková","Martina Mockovčiaková","Eric Sopena"],"meta":["January 2018Discussiones Mathematicae Graph Theory 40(1)","DOI:10.7151/dmgt.2140"],"references":["222020275_Star_arboricity_of_graphs","26645155_On_the_maximum_average_degree_and_the_incidence_chromatic_number_of_a_graph","285329220_Planar_graph_with_maximum_degree_7_is_of_class_1","222499233_On_incidence_coloring_and_star_arboricity_of_graphs","220192907_Incidence_and_strong_colorings_of_graphs"]}
