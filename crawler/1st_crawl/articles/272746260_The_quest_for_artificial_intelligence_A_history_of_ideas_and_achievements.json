{"id":"272746260_The_quest_for_artificial_intelligence_A_history_of_ideas_and_achievements","abstract":"Artificial intelligence (AI) is a field within computer science that is attempting to build enhanced intelligence into computer systems. This book traces the history of the subject, from the early dreams of eighteenth-century (and earlier) pioneers to the more successful work of today’s AI engineers. AI is becoming more and more a part of everyone’s life. The technology is already embedded in face-recognizing cameras, speech-recognition software, Internet search engines, and health-care robots, among other applications. The book’s many diagrams and easy-to-understand descriptions of AI programs will help the casual reader gain an understanding of how these and other AI systems actually work. Its thorough (but unobtrusive) end-of-chapter notes containing citations to important source materials will be of great use to AI scholars and researchers. This book promises to be the definitive history of a field that has captivated the imaginations of scientists, philosophers, and writers for centuries.","authors":["Nils Nilsson"],"meta":["January 2010","DOI:10.1017/CBO9780511819346","Publisher: Cambridge University PressISBN: 9780521122931"],"references":["228075668_Memory-Based_Language_Processing","313716676_Language_access_to_distributed_data_with_error_recovery","292863835_Computer_vision","234784844_Empirical_Explorations_with_the_Logic_Theory_Machine_A_Case_Study_in_Heuristics","231071257_Programming_a_computer_to_play_chess"]}
