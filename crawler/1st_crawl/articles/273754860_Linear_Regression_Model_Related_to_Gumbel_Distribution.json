{"id":"273754860_Linear_Regression_Model_Related_to_Gumbel_Distribution","abstract":"Linear regression model is suggested to construct a proper estimation of parameters of Gumbel distribution as influences that affect on manufactured items. Such type of distributions and its properties that relevant to Gamma-distribution has been shown in this study. Some contributions of other extreme value distributions types such as Weibull distribution, and Fre ÃÅchet distribution were introduced in general forms as models used for lifetime data. Maximum likelihood estimation (M.L.E) method was suggested to estimate the values of parameters because of its effective ability to obtain the best approximation for fitting data compared with other estimation methods like least square method, moments method and other estimation methods. Also this method was chosen because it is the best method for small sample sizes","authors":["Karrar Deiaa Mohamed Al-Sabti","Ahmad Abbas mohammed Aladdilee"],"meta":["January 2014"],"references":["314733629_Statistical_Models_and_Methods_for_Lifetime_Data","271328085_Extreme_Value_and_Related_Models_With_Applications_in_Engineering_and_Science","266161026_Extreme_Value_and_Related_Models_in_Engineering_and_Science_Applications","257934428_Statistical_Methods_of_Reliability_Data","254331820_Linear_Estimation_of_a_Regression_Relationship_from_Censored_Data_Part_I-Simple_Methods_and_Their_Application","48377535_Statistical_Models_and_Methods_for_Life-Time_Data"]}
