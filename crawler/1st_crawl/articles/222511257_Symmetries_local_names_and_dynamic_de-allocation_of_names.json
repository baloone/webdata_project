{"id":"222511257_Symmetries_local_names_and_dynamic_de-allocation_of_names","abstract":"The semantics of name-passing calculi is often defined employing coalgebraic models over presheaf categories. This elegant theory lacks finiteness properties, hence it is not apt to implementation. Coalgebras over named sets, called history-dependent automata, are better suited for the purpose due to locality of names. A theory of behavioural functors for named sets is still lacking: the semantics of each language has been given in an ad-hoc way, and algorithms were implemented only for the π-calculus. Existence of the final coalgebra for the π-calculus was never proved. We introduce a language of accessible functors to specify history-dependent automata in a modular way, leading to a clean formulation and a generalisation of previous results, and to the proof of existence of a final coalgebra in a wide range of cases.","authors":["Vincenzo Ciancia","Ugo Montanari"],"meta":["December 2010Information and Computation 208(12):1349-1367","DOI:10.1016/j.ic.2009.10.007","SourceDBLP"],"references":["268442693_Permutation_groups_and_polynomial-time_computation","222709698_Relationally_Staged_Computations_in_Calculi_of_Mobile_Processes","222694175_A_Name_Abstraction_Functor_for_Named_Sets","222565700_A_Compositional_Coalgebraic_Model_of_a_Fragment_of_Fusion_Calculus","221602524_Efficient_Minimization_up_to_Location_Equivalence","221570176_Minimizing_Transition_Systems_for_Name_Passing_Calculi_A_Co-algebraic_Formulation","221350883_A_Category_of_Explicit_Fusions","220606897_About_permutation_algebras_presheaves_and_named_sets","220370643_A_Categorical_Model_of_the_Fusion_Calculus","220369161_Comparing_Operational_Models_of_Name-Passing_Process_Calculi","220367195_Terminal_sequences_for_accessible_endofunctors","4263852_Pi-Calculus_in_Logical_Form","2928709_Presheaf_Models_for_the_p-Calculus","277296934_Universal_Coalgebra_a_Theory_of_Systems","270956456_A_Calculus_of_Mobile_Processes_Parts_I_and_II","269019547_Familles_universelles_de_morphismes","266286285_Introduction_to_coalgebra","262206069_Semantics_of_Name_and_Value_Passing","245624208_CCS-A_Calculus_for_Communicating_Systems","242411942_Name-passing_process_calculi_operational_models_and_structural_operational_semantics","242387002_History_Dependent_Automata","239567638_Lambda_calculus_notattion_with_nameless_dummies_a_tool_for_automatic_formula_manipulation","237128420_Locally_Presentable_and_Accessible_Categories","225329587_p-Calculus_Structured_Coalgebras_and_Minimal_HD-Automata","225204683_Minimal_transition_systems_for_history-preserving_bisimulation","225194757_Concurrent_bisimulations_in_Petri_nets","222840479_Universal_coalgebra_A_theory_of_systems","222824330_Structured_coalgebras_and_minimal_HD-automata_for_the_-calculus","222520776_Coalgebraic_minimization_of_HD-automata_for_the_-calculus_using_polymorphic_types","222294431_Lambda_Calculus_Notation_with_Nameless_Dummies_a_Tool_for_Automatic_Formula_Manipulation_with_Application_to_the_Church-Rosser_Theorem","220700840_A_First_Order_Coalgebraic_Model_of_pi-Calculus_Early_Observational_Equivalence","220688322_Petri_Nets_An_Introduction","220688100_A_Calculus_of_Communicating_System","220431549_Institutions_Abstract_Model_Theory_for_Specification_and_Programming","220403795_SMC_A_symmetry-based_model_checker_for_verification_of_safety_and_liveness_properties","220248383_A_Calculus_of_Mobile_Processes_I","220248215_Comparing_operational_models_of_name-passing_process_calculi","220247917_A_Calculus_for_Cryptographic_Protocols_-_The_Spi_Calculus","220102489_A_New_Approach_to_Abstract_Syntax_with_Variable_Binding","38380917_Review_N_G_De_Bruijn_Lambda_Calculus_Notation_with_Nameless_Dummies_a_Tool_for_Automatic_Formula_Manipulation_with_Application_to_the_Church-Rosser_Theorem","37537098_Semantic_constructions_for_the_specification_of_objects","3902854_Semantics_of_name_and_value_passing","3811852_New_approach_to_abstract_syntax_involving_binders","3811839_Abstract_syntax_and_variable_binding","2870297_p-Calculus_Early_Observational_Equivalence_A_First_Order_Coalgebraic_Model","2587757_A_Tutorial_on_CoAlgebras_and_CoInduction","2376998_Compositional_SOS_and_Beyond_A_Coalgebraic_View_of_Open_Systems","2309624_A_Fully_Abstract_Semantics_for_Causality_in_the_Pi-Calculus","2274496_A_Calculus_of_Mobile_Processes_Part_I"]}
