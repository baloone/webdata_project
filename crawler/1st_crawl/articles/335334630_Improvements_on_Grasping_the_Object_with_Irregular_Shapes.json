{"id":"335334630_Improvements_on_Grasping_the_Object_with_Irregular_Shapes","abstract":"The image processing technique has been rapidly developed during the last years due to the improvement of computer science and applied algorithms. The paper aims to analyse the method for designing the active surfaces of the gripper suitable for the object with irregular shapes. Concerning these particularities, we have taken the object picture in order to process it. By using the appropriate algorithms, the results were transferred in the three dimensional modelling software, so that the fingers were designed according to the object shapes. Finally, they have been manufactured using the 3D printer and the technical performances were analysed.","authors":["Alina Spanu","Dragoi George","Iolanda Panait"],"meta":["January 2019MATEC Web of Conferences 290(4):04010","DOI:10.1051/matecconf/201929004010"],"references":["343098004_Some_technological_particularities_on_the_execution_of_dental_prostheses_realized_by_selective_laser_deposition","330513245_A_Visualization_Technique_to_Support_Searching_Filtering","329295087_Study_of_deflection_behavior_of_3D_printed_leaf_springs","326738358_Closing_the_Loop_for_Robotic_Grasping_A_Real-time_Generative_Grasp_Synthesis_Approach","326027425_IMAGING_In-Memory_AlGorithms_for_Image_processiNG","325276543_Markov_Processes_in_Image_Processing","325163672_Fast_Ellipse_Detection_via_Gradient_Information_for_Robotic_Manipulation_of_Cylindrical_Objects","324558524_Closing_the_Loop_for_Robotic_Grasping_A_Real-time_Generative_Grasp_Synthesis_Approach","305081059_Digital_Image_Processing_with_MATLAB","286679595_Realtime_tracking_and_grasping_of_a_moving_object_from_range_video","234759288_An_Introduction_to_Digital_Image_Processing_With_Matlab"]}
