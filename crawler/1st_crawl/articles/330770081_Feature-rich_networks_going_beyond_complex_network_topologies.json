{"id":"330770081_Feature-rich_networks_going_beyond_complex_network_topologies","abstract":"Abstract The growing availability of multirelational data gives rise to an opportunity for novel characterization of complex real-world relations, supporting the proliferation of diverse network models such as Attributed Graphs, Heterogeneous Networks, Multilayer Networks, Temporal Networks, Location-aware Networks, Knowledge Networks, Probabilistic Networks, and many other task-driven and data-driven models. In this paper, we propose an overview of these models and their main applications, described under the common denomination of Feature-rich Networks, i. e. models where the expressive power of the network topology is enhanced by exposing one or more peculiar features. The aim is also to sketch a scenario that can inspire the design of novel feature-rich network models, which in turn can support innovative methods able to exploit the full potential of mining complex network structures in domain-specific applications.","authors":["Roberto Interdonato","Martin Atzmueller","Sabrina Gaito","Rushed Kanawati"],"meta":["January 2019Applied Network Science 4(1)","DOI:10.1007/s41109-019-0111-x"],"references":["346062669_On_the_Representation_and_Querying_of_Sets_of_Possible_Worlds","326997146_Foundations_of_Temporal_Text_Networks","326961617_A_Graph-Based_Security_Framework_for_Securing_Industrial_IoT_Networks_From_Vulnerability_Exploitations","321936302_User_Modeling_for_Point-of-Interest_Recommendations_in_Location-Based_Social_Networks_The_State_of_the_Art","326435057_DBpedia_-_A_Crystallization_Point_for_the_Web_of_Data","326338261_Semantic_Web_in_Data_Mining_and_Knowledge_Discovery_A_Comprehensive_Survey","325742135_Multilayer_social_networks","324636441_Homophily_at_Academic_Conferences","321893087_Mixed-Initiative_Feature_Engineering_Using_Knowledge_Graphs","320954246_Identifying_Users_With_Alternate_Behaviors_of_Lurking_and_Active_Participation_in_Multilayer_Social_Networks"]}
