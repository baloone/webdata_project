{"id":"318701997_An_Integrated_Model_of_Work-Study_Conflict_and_Work-Study_Facilitation","abstract":"The rise in working university students is a global phenomenon with more than half of the student population working while studying at university. Within this trend of dual participation, working students face unique stressors such as work–study conflict and facilitation. Work–study conflict drives students' poor health, whereas work–study facilitation drives positive academic outcomes. In this article, we review and critique several work–study interface models proposed to explain the development and consequences of these stressors. The review uncovers important omissions and limitations of the models, reducing their utility and generalizability. Therefore, we propose a new work-to-study model, which addresses the omissions of the previous models. The work-to-study model builds on the current literature and models and integrates psychosocial safety climate theory, as it relates to the extended job demands–resources model to advance our understanding of the development and consequences of work–study conflict and facilitation.","authors":["Mikaela Owen","Phil Kavanagh","Maureen Dollard"],"meta":["July 2017Journal of Career Development 45(5)","DOI:10.1177/0894845317720071"],"references":["282968074_An_Examination_of_the_Relationship_Between_the_Work-School_Interface_Job_Satisfaction_and_Job_Performance","271799176_Multiple_Roles_and_Role_Strain_Some_Notes_on_Human_Energy_Time_and_Commitment","261704361_Integrating_psychosocial_safety_climate_in_the_JD-R_model_A_study_amongst_Malaysian_workers","259845594_Development_and_Initial_Validation_of_a_Measure_of_Work_Family_and_School_Conflict","282521879_Integrating_Work_and_Study_Among_Young_Adults_Testing_an_Empirical_Model","280262293_Working_while_studying_at_university_The_relationship_between_work_benefits_and_demands_and_engagement_and_well-being","265924982_Does_Involvement_Really_Matter_Indicators_of_College_Student_Success_and_Satisfaction","265732094_Weekly_work-school_conflict_sleep_quality_and_fatigue_Recovery_self-efficacy_as_a_cross-level_moderator","263447081_Psychosocial_safety_climate_as_an_antecedent_of_work_characteristics_and_psychological_strain_A_multilevel_model","257529147_Work-School_Conflict_and_Health_Outcomes_Beneficial_Resources_for_Working_College_Students"]}
