{"id":"273682794_A_Large_Neighbourhood_Search_Heuristic_for_a_Periodic_Supply_Vessel_Planning_Problem_Arising_in_Offshore_Oil_and_Gas_Operations","abstract":"The periodic supply vessel planning problem arises in supply operations performed by a heterogeneous fleet of vessels operating from an onshore base to offshore installations. These vessels must supply the installations on a periodic basis. Given a planning horizon, the problem consists of determining the fleet composition as well as the vessel schedules. This paper proposes a large neighbourhood search heuristic capable of solving large instances of the problem. On small instances for which an optimal solution is known, the heuristic consistently finds optimal or near-optimal solutions. It can also solve larger instances which are intractable by an exact algorithm.","authors":["Aliaksandr Shyshou","Irina Gribkovskaia","Gilbert Laporte","Kjetil Fagerholt"],"meta":["November 2012INFOR Information Systems and Operational Research 50(4):195-204","DOI:10.3138/infor.50.4.195"],"references":["226187312_Routing_a_Heterogeneous_Fleet_of_Vehicles","225670523_Minimizing_Labor_Requirements_in_a_Periodic_Vehicle_Loading_Problem","312579013_Using_constraint_programming_and_local_search_methods_to_solve_vehicle_routing_problems","245281317_A_tabu_search_heuristic_for_a_routing_problem_arising_in_servicing_of_offshore_oil_and_gas_platforms","245280553_Vehicle_Routing_With_Multiple_Use_Of_Vehicles","237127995_Approximation_algorithms_for_bin-packing","235345399_Optimal_fleet_composition_and_periodic_routing_of_offshore_supply_vessels","233618045_A_heuristic_for_vehicle_fleet_mix_problem_using_tabu_search_and_set_partitioning","229644464_Optimal_Fleet_Design_in_a_Ship_Routing_Problem","227733660_Flexibility_and_complexity_in_periodic_distribution_problems"]}
