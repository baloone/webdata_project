{"id":"326278996_A_Residue-based_approach_for_Resource_Provisioning_by_Horizontal_Scaling_across_Heterogeneous_Clouds","abstract":"A cloud's elasticity which makes it attractive is limited to its physical resources. As a measure to prevent this limitation from being a hindrance to the attraction, the cloud inter-operates with other clouds. This improves its resource strength by borrowing necessary resources from the clouds with which it inter-operates. Normally, this borrowing happens from one cloud to satisfy one request arriving to it, thereby enhancing its elasticity to a certain extent. Further enhancement is achieved by horizontal scaling across clouds to satisfy a single request. In this work, the enhancement is taken one step further to propose a novel residue-based resource provisioning technique for a cloud to perform horizontal scaling by splitting a request dynamically based on the resource availability in itself and in the clouds with which it inter-operates. Also, a greedy technique is presented to rank clouds and hence, additionally contribute to the enhancement of elasticity and, in turn, to the effectiveness of the resource provisioning technique used in inter-operating cloud environments. Results obtained from real-time heterogeneous cloud environments prove the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.","authors":["Kirthica S.","Rajeswari Sridhar"],"meta":["July 2018International Journal of Approximate Reasoning 101","DOI:10.1016/j.ijar.2018.07.002"],"references":["310741034_Towards_Understanding_Uncertainty_in_Cloud_Computing_with_risks_of_Confidentiality_Integrity_and_Availability"]}
