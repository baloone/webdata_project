{"id":"4371243_Using_an_Assurance_Case_to_Support_Independent_Assessment_of_the_Transition_to_a_New_GPS_Ground_Control_System","abstract":"We describe a specific application of assurance cases to the problem of ensuring that a transition from a legacy system to its replacement will not compromise mission assurance objectives. The application in question was the transition of the Global Positioning System (GPS) to a new ground-control system. The transition, which took place over five days, required uninterrupted control of the GPS satellite constellation while control was transferred from a 1970s-era mainframe to a distributed architecture. We created an assurance case so that the procedural documentation we had could be restructured into a form amenable to analysis. The analysis concluded that there were no major hazards; this conclusion was validated by a successful transition.","authors":["Elisabeth A. Nguyen","William S.
