{"id":"343542953_Vaccines_for_pregnant_women_Absurd_-_Mapping_maternal_vaccination_discourse_and_stance_on_social_media_over_six_months","abstract":"Objective\nTo understand the predominant topics of discussion, stance and associated language used on social media platforms relating to maternal vaccines in 15 countries over a six-month period.\n\nBackground\nIn 2019, the World Health Organisation prioritised vaccine hesitancy as a top ten global health threat and recognized the role of viral misinformation on social media as propagating vaccine hesitancy. Maternal vaccination offers the potential to improve maternal and child health, and to reduce the risk of severe morbidity and mortality in pregnancy. Understanding the topics of discussion, stance and language used around maternal vaccines on social media can inform public health bodies on how to combat vaccine misinformation and vaccine hesitancy.\n\nMethods\nSocial media data was extracted (Twitter, forums, blogs and comments) for six months from 15 countries (Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, India, Italy, Korea, Mexico, Panama, South Africa, Spain, United Kingdom and United States). We used stance, discourse and topic analysis to provide insight into the most frequent and weighted keywords, hashtags and themes of conversation within and across countries.\n\nResults\nWe exported a total of 19,192 social media posts in 16 languages obtained between 1st November 2018 and 30th April 2019. After screening all posts, 16,000 were included in analyses, while excluding retweets, 2,722 were annotated for sentiment. Main topics of discussion were the safety of the maternal influenza and pertussis vaccines. Discouraging posts were most common in Italy (44.9%), and the USA (30.8%).\n\nConclusion\nAbstract\nObjective\nTo understand the predominant topics of discussion, stance and associated language used on social media platforms relating to maternal vaccines in 15 countries over a six-month period.\n\nBackground\nIn 2019, the World Health Organisation prioritised vaccine hesitancy as a top ten global health threat and recognized the role of viral misinformation on social media as propagating vaccine hesitancy.

These discussions included the promotion of vaccination, involvement of pregnant women in vaccine research, and the trust and transparency of institutions. Future research should examine the relationship between stance (promotional, neutral, ambiguous, discouraging) online and maternal vaccination uptake in the respective regions.\n\nKeywords\nMaternal vaccines, Vaccine confidence, Social media, Sentiment analysis, Stance analysis, Machine learning, Vaccine acceptance, Vaccine uptake, Vaccine misinformation, Discourse analysis, Hashtags","authors":["Sam Martin","Eliz Kilich","Sara Dada","Per Egil Kummervold"],"meta":["August 2020Vaccine","DOI:10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.07.072","Project: Vaccine Hesitancy and Social Media"],"references":["342826800_Factors_that_influence_vaccination_decision-making_among_pregnant_women_A_systematic_review_and_meta-analysis","340289369_Categorising_Vaccine_Confidence_with_Transformer-Based_Machine_Learning_Model_The_Nuances_of_Vaccine_Sentiment_on_Twitter_Preprint","335266590_Vaccine_hesitancy_and_fake_news_Quasi-experimental_evidence_from_Italy","330333098_HPV_vaccination_in_a_context_of_public_mistrust_and_uncertainty_a_systematic_literature_review_of_determinants_of_HPV_vaccine_hesitancy_in_Europe","327877817_Maternal_vaccine_knowledge_in_low-_and_middle-income_countries-and_why_it_matters","327209378_Weaponized_Health_Communication_Twitter_Bots_and_Russian_Trolls_Amplify_the_Vaccine_Debate","327053492_The_shift_from_public_science_communication_to_public_relations_The_Vaxxed_case","325777068_Factors_associated_with_uptake_of_influenza_and_pertussis_vaccines_among_pregnant_women_in_South_Australia","323499474_Understanding_the_barriers_to_uptake_of_antenatal_vaccination_by_women_from_culturally_and_linguistically_diverse_backgrounds_A_cross-sectional_study","319072013_A_Vaccine_Crisis_in_the_Era_of_Social_Media","305749354_Guideline_for_collection_analysis_and_presentation_of_safety_data_in_clinical_trials_of_vaccines_in_pregnant_women","301282163_VAC_Mediboard_Analysing_Vaccine_Rumours_in_News_and_Social_Media","287411502_The_urban_myth_of_the_association_between_neurological_disorders_and_vaccinations","281394914_Understanding_factors_influencing_vaccination_acceptance_during_pregnancy_globally_A_literature_review","8400640_Effectiveness_of_Influenza_Vaccine_during_Pregnancy_in_Preventing_Hospitalizations_and_Outpatient_Visits_for_Respiratory_Illness_in_Pregnant_Women_and_Their_Infants","337848552_An_Analysis_of_the_Consequences_of_the_General_Data_Protection_Regulation_on_Social_Network_Research","335381548_Near-Real_Time_Monitoring_of_Vaccine_Uptake_of_Pregnant_Women_in_a_Primary_Care_Sentinel_Network_Ontological_Case_Definition_Across_Heterogeneous_Data_Sources","331906437_National_Immunization_Programme_-_Mission_Indradhanush_Programme_Newer_Approaches_and_Interventions","327941982_Influenza_and_Tdap_Vaccination_Coverage_Among_Pregnant_Women_-_United_States_April_2018","326630846_Use_of_social_networking_sites_and_women's_decision_to_receive_vaccinations_during_pregnancy_A_cross-sectional_study_in_the_UK","317252758_Semantic_network_analysis_of_vaccine_sentiment_in_online_social_media","293640404_Publicly_Available_Online_Tool_Facilitates_Real-Time_Monitoring_Of_Vaccine_Conversations_And_Sentiments","276259607_Identifying_policy_frames_through_semantic_network_analysis_an_examination_of_nuclear_energy_policy_across_six_countries"]}
