{"id":"283117856_Symmetric_Blind_Decryption_with_Perfect_Secrecy","abstract":"A blind decryption scheme enables a user to query decryptions from a\ndecryption server without revealing information about the plaintext message.\nSuch schemes are useful, for example, for the implementation of privacy\npreserving encrypted file storages and payment systems. In terms of\nfunctionality, blind decryption is close to oblivious transfer. For noiseless\nchannels, information-theoretically secure oblivious transfer is impossible.\nHowever, in this paper we show that this is not the case for blind decryption.\nWe formulate a definition of perfect secrecy of symmetric blind decryption for\nthe following setting: at most one of the scheme participants is a malicious\nobserver. We also devise a symmetric blind decryption scheme based on modular\narithmetic on a ring $\\mathbb{Z}_{p^2}$, where $p$ is a prime, and show that it\nsatisfies our notion of perfect secrecy.","authors":["Juha Partala"],"meta":["August 2017Journal of Computer Networks and Communications 2017","DOI:10.1155/2017/6575907","SourcearXiv"],"references":["237841548_Practical_Fully_Simulatable_Oblivious_Transfer_with_Sublinear_Communication","234778924_How_to_play_ANY_mental_game","321609916_Advances_in_Cryptology_-_CRYPTO'_92_12th_Annual_International_Cryptology_Conference_Santa_Barbara_California_USA_August_16-20_1992_Proceedings","300915522_Big_Data_Security_and_Privacy","300634071_Efficient_Adaptive_Oblivious_Transfer_Without_q-type_Assumptions_in_UC_Framework","285347759_On_the_Impossibility_of_Basing_Oblivious_Transfer_and_Bit_Commitment_on_Weakened_Security_Assumptions","238594836_Privacy_Enabled_Digital_Rights_Management_Without_Trusted_Third_Party_Assumption","227311719_Simulatable_Adaptive_Oblivious_Transfer","225717969_A_key_escrow_system_with_protecting_user's_privacy_by_blind_decoding","225705864_Wallet_Databases_with_Observers"]}
