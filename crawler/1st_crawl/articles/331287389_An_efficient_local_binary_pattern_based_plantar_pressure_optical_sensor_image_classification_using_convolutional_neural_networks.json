{"id":"331287389_An_efficient_local_binary_pattern_based_plantar_pressure_optical_sensor_image_classification_using_convolutional_neural_networks","abstract":"The objective of this study was to design and produce highly comfortable shoe products guided by a plantar pressure imaging data-set. In this research a plantar pressure optical imaging data-set based classification technology has been developed. In this paper, an improved local binary pattern (LBP) algorithm is used to retrieve texture-based features and recognize patterns from the data-set. A calculation model of plantar pressure imaging feature area is established subsequently. The data-set is classified by a neural network to guide the generation of various shoe-last surfaces. Firstly, the local binary mode is improved to adapt to the pressure imaging data-set, and the texture-based feature calculation is fully used to accurately generate the feature point set; hereafter, the plantar pressure imaging feature point set is then used to guide the design of last free surface forming. In the presented experiments of plantar imaging, multi-dimensional texture-based features and improved LBP features have been found by a convolution neural network (CNN), and compared with a 21-input-3-output two-layer perceptual neural network. Three feet types are investigated in the experiment, being flatfoot (F) referring to the lack of a normal arch, or arch collapse, Talipes Equinovarus (TE), being the front part of the foot is adduction, calcaneus varus, plantar flexion, or Achilles tendon contracture and Normal (N). This research has achieved an 82% accuracy rate with 10 hidden-layers CNN of rotation invariance LBP (RI-LBP) algorithm using 21 texture-based features by comparing other deep learning methods presented in the literature.","authors":["Cunlei Wang","Donghui Li","Zairan Li","Dan Wang"],"meta":["February 2019Optik - International Journal for Light and Electron Optics 185(3)","DOI:10.1016/j.ijleo.2019.02.109"],"references":["328405019_Image_recognition_method_using_Local_Binary_Pattern_and_the_Random_Forest_classifier_to_count_post_larvae_shrimp","327299858_Hand_gesture_recognition_method_based_on_HOG-LBP_features_for_mobile_devices","326609354_Data_augmentation_on_mice_liver_cirrhosis_microscopic_images_employing_convolutional_neural_networks_and_support_vector_machine","325663368_An_Analysis_Of_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_For_Image_Classification","325652525_Application_of_Feature_Extraction_and_Classification_Methods_for_Histopathological_Image_using_GLCM_LBP_LBGLCM_GLRLM_and_SFTA","325555561_Diabetic_plantar_pressure_analysis_using_image_fusion","325085904_Polarization_Image_Texture_Feature_Extraction_Algorithm_Based_on_CS-LBP_Operator","320436175_Image_Inconsistency_Detection_Using_Local_Binary_Pattern_LBP","318358372_A_novel_approach_for_cirrhosis_recognition_via_improved_LBP_algorithm_and_dictionary_learning","314116255_Case-Based_Reasoning_for_Product_Style_Construction_and_Fuzzy_Analytic_Hierarchy_Process_Evaluation_Modeling_Using_Consumers_Linguistic_Variables","312472908_Convolutional_Neural_Network_Based_Clustering_and_Manifold_Learning_Method_for_Diabetic_Plantar_Pressure_Imaging_Dataset","309723751_Self-Calibration_of_Dead_Reckoning_Sensor_for_Skid-Steer_Mobile_Robot_Localization_Using_Neuro-Fuzzy_Systems","309441482_Plantar_pressure_asymmetry_and_risk_of_stress_injuries_in_the_foot_of_young_soccer_players","257712964_Rapid_Detection_of_Foot-and-Mouth_Disease_Virus_with_Optical_Microchip_Sensors","224870602_Thyroid_Nodule_Recognition_Based_on_Feature_Selection_and_Pixel_Classification_Methods","346694415_Shoes_and_Shoe_Modifications","328706863_A_Review_of_Image_Set_Classification","328667007_Deep_convolutional_neural_networks_for_diabetic_retinopathy_detection_by_image_classification","328414188_External_Feedback_during_Walking_Improves_Measures_of_Plantar_Pressure_in_Individuals_with_Chronic_Ankle_Instability","328255421_Deep_convolution_neural_network_for_image_recognition","327990921_Noise_robust_and_rotation_invariant_framework_for_texture_analysis_and_classification","327648446_Hierarchical_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_Fashion_Image_Classification","326702716_Flexible_pressure_sensor_based_on_PVDF_nanofiber","326680017_Simple_implantable_wireless_sensor_platform_to_measure_pressure_and_force","324219206_Region-specific_foot_pain_and_plantar_pressure_in_people_with_rheumatoid_arthritis_A_cross-sectional_study","323564698_Foot_posture_is_associated_with_plantar_pressure_during_gait_A_comparison_of_normal_planus_and_cavus_feet","322168869_Expanded_Age_Indication_for_Ponseti_Method_for_Correction_of_Congenital_Idiopathic_Talipes_Equinovarus_A_Systematic_Review","321630230_A_new_deep_convolutional_neural_network_for_fast_hyperspectral_image_classification","319543771_Histogram_of_Oriented_Gradient_Based_Plantar_Pressure_Image_Feature_Extraction_and_Classification_Employing_Fuzzy_Support_Vector_Machine","317032057_LBP_maps_for_improving_fractal_based_texture_classification","313575668_Statistical_and_structural_approaches_to_texture","312408472_Fusion_of_Color_Histogram_and_LBP-based_Features_for_Texture_Image_Retrieval_and_Classification","312108349_An_Image_Texture_Insensitive_Method_for_Saliency_Detection","302065771_An_Efficient_Technique_for_Rice_Grain_Classification_Using_Back_Propagation_Neural_Network_and_Wavelet_Decomposition","301756735_An_Image_Contrast-Based_Pressure_Sensor","270542045_A_Comparative_Study_on_Local_Binary_Pattern_LBP_based_Face_Recognition_LBP_Histogram_versus_LBP_Image","235775096_Reliability_of_plantar_pressure_platforms","223307810_Texture_descriptors_based_on_co-occurrence_matrices","3193420_Multiresolution_Gray-Scale_and_Rotation_Invariant_Texture_Classification_with_Local_Binary_Patterns"]}
