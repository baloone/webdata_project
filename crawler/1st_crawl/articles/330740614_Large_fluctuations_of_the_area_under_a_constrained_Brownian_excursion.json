{"id":"330740614_Large_fluctuations_of_the_area_under_a_constrained_Brownian_excursion","abstract":"We study large fluctuations of the area A under a Brownian excursion x(t) on the time interval |t| ≤ T , constrained to stay away from a moving wall x0(t) such that x 0 (-T) = x 0 (T) = 0 and x 0 (|t| < T) > 0. We focus on wall functions described by a family of generalized parabolas x 0 (t) = Tγ[1 - (t/T )2k], where k ≥ 1. Using the optimal fluctuation method (OFM), we calculate the large deviation function (LDF) of the area at long times. The OFM provides a simple description of the area fluctuations in terms of optimal paths, or rays, of the Brownian motion. We show that the LDF has a jump in the third derivative with respect to A at a critical value of A. This singularity results from a qualitative change of the optimal path, and it can be interpreted as a third-order dynamical phase transition. Although the OFM is not applicable for typical (small) area fluctuations, we argue that it correctly captures their power-law scaling of A with T, with an exponent that depends continuously on γ and on k. We also consider the cosinewall x 0 (t) = Tγ cos[πt/(2T)] to illustrate a different possible behavior of the optimal path and of the scaling of typical fluctuations. For some wall functions additional phase transitions, which result from a coexistence of multiple OFM solutions, should be possible.","authors":["Baruch Meerson"],"meta":["January 2019Journal of Statistical Mechanics Theory and Experiment 2019(1):013210","DOI:10.1088/1742-5468/aafa81"],"references":["225881121_On_orthogonal_and_symplectic_matrix_ensembles","220224687_On_the_Analysis_of_Linear_Probing_Hashing","2108337_Constrained_Brownian_motion_Fluctuations_away_from_circular_and_parabolic_barriers","2070936_Level-Spacing_Distributions_and_the_Airy_Kernel","321502378_Grundlehren_der_mathematischen_Wissenschaften","305975173_Kac's_formula_levy's_local_time_and_brownian_excursion","301306074_Large_deviations_for_the_height_in_1D_Kardar-Parisi-Zhang_growth_at_late_times","267007738_A_Bernoulli_Excursion_and_Its_Various_Applications","266430748_Limit_Distributions_for_the_Bernoulli_Meander","226128025_Brownian_motion_with_a_parabolic_drift_and_Airy_functions","38361657_On_the_Supremum_of_a_Certain_Gaussian_Process","1951189_Exact_statistical_properties_of_the_Burgers_equation","1874340_Airy_Distribution_Function_From_the_Area_Under_a_Brownian_Excursion_to_the_Maximal_Height_of_Fluctuating_Interfaces","1846647_Brownian_Functionals_in_Physics_and_Computer_Science"]}
