{"id":"233947151_Simplified_quantum_bit_commitment_using_single_photon_nonlocality","abstract":"We simplified our previously proposed quantum bit commitment (QBC) protocol based on the Mach-Zehnder interferometer, by replacing symmetric beam splitters with asymmetric ones. It eliminates the need for random sending time of the photons; thus, the feasibility and efficiency are both improved. The protocol is immune to the cheating strategy in the Mayers-Lo-Chau no-go theorem of unconditionally secure QBC, because the density matrices of the committed states do not satisfy a crucial condition on which the no-go theorem holds.","authors":["Guang Ping He"],"meta":["December 2012Quantum Information Processing 13(10)","DOI:10.1007/s11128-014-0728-8","SourcearXiv"],"references":["311761902_Probabilistic_theories_with_purification_phys","277242840_The_quantum_bit_commitment_a_complete_classification_of_protocols","248702826_On_the_impossibility_of_non-static_quantum_bit_commitment_between_two_parties","240029764_What_is_going_on_with_Quantum_Bit_Commitment","228109483_WITHDRAWN_Quantum_cryptography_Public_key_distribution_and_coin_tossing","220436086_Optimization_of_coherent_attacks_in_generalizations_of_the_BB84_quantum_bit_commitment_protocol","45929406_Experimental_quantum_cryptography_scheme_based_on_orthogonal_states","44899356_Probabilistic_Theories_with_Purification","12332437_Simple_Proof_of_Security_of_the_BB84_Quantum_Key_Distribution_Protocol","3593544_A_quantum_bit_commitment_scheme_provably_unbreakable_by_bothparties","2795018_Quantum_Cryptography_Based_on_Orthogonal_States","2620245_Is_Quantum_Bit_Commitment_Really_Possible","2330926_The_Trouble_with_Quantum_Bit_Commitment","2203019_Defeating_classical_bit_commitments_with_a_quantum_computer","2202555_A_brief_review_on_the_impossibility_of_quantum_bit_commitment","2201608_Unconditionally_Secure_Quantum_Bit_Commitment_is_Impossible","2191381_Superselection_rules_and_quantum_protocols","2191295_Remote_preparation_of_arbitrary_ensembles_and_quantum_bit_commitment","2189477_Superselection_Rules_in_Quantum_Cryptography","2188888_The_quantum_bit_commitment_a_finite_open_system_approach_for_a_complete_classification_of_protocols","2186182_Degrees_of_concealment_and_bindingness_in_quantum_bit_commitment_protocols","2184729_The_Quantum_Bit_Commitment_Theorem","257981917_Generating_photon-encoded_W_states_in_multiport_waveguide-array_systems","257641932_Cheat_sensitive_quantum_bit_commitment_via_pre-_and_post-selected_quantum_states","254498267_Counterfactual_attack_on_counterfactual_quantum_key_distribution","253239370_Secure_quantum_bit_commitment_against_empty_promises_II_The_density_matrix","243473844_Quantum_Cryptography_Based_on_Split_Transmission_of_One-Bit_Information_in_Two_Steps","235565365_Secure_quantum_bit_commitment_against_empty_promises","235518116_Cheat-sensitive_commitment_of_a_classical_bit_coded_in_a_block_of_m_n_round-trip_qubits","234790546_Founding_crytpography_on_oblivious_transfer","234516779_Counterfactual_quantum_key_distribution_with_high_efficiency","233836053_An_Unconditionally_Secure_Quantum_Bit_Commitment_Protocol","222457508_A_complete_classification_of_quantum_ensembles_having_a_given_density_matrix","221591951_Founding_Cryptography_on_Oblivious_Transfer","48204100_Optimal_Bounds_for_Quantum_Bit_Commitment","48194637_Quantum_key_distribution_based_on_orthogonal_states_allows_securequantum_bit_commitment","45852978_A_short_impossibility_proof_of_Quantum_Bit_Commitment","45852596_Strong_no-go_theorem_for_Gaussian_quantum_bit_commitment","43021195_Counterfactual_Quantum_Cryptography","8538038_Cheat_Sensitive_Quantum_Bit_Commitment","2629573_Security_of_Quantum_Protocols_Against_Coherent_Measurements","2202389_Making_An_Empty_Promise_With_A_Quantum_Computer","2201590_Why_quantum_bit_commitment_and_ideal_quantum_coin_tossing_are_impossible","2198533_Reexamination_of_Quantum_Bit_Commitment_the_Possible_and_the_Impossible","2197567_Insecurity_of_Quantum_Bit_Commitment_with_Secret_Parameters","2196315_Secret_parameters_in_quantum_bit_commitment","2190610_Quantum_Bit_Commitment_with_a_Composite_Evidence","2189974_Quantum_Bit_Commitment_Using_Entangled_States"]}
