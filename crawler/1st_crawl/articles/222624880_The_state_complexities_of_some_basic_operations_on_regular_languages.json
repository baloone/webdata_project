{"id":"222624880_The_state_complexities_of_some_basic_operations_on_regular_languages","abstract":"We consider the state complexities of some basic operations on regular languages. We show that the number of states that is sufficient and necessary in the worst case for a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) to accept the catenation of an m-state DFA language and an n-state DFA language is exactly m2n − 2n − 1, for m, n ⩾ 1. The result of 2n − 1 + 2n − 2 states is obtained for the star of an n-state DFA language, n1. State complexities for other basic operations and for regular languages over a one-letter alphabet are also studied.","authors":["Sheng Yu","Qingyu Zhuang","Kai Salomaa"],"meta":["March 1994Theoretical Computer Science 125(2):315-328","DOI:10.1016/0304-3975(92)00011-F","SourceDBLP"],"references":["292123042_Economy_of_description_by_automata_grammars_and_formal_systems","232839495_Constructions_for_alternating_finite_automata","228057764_Introduction_To_Automata_Theory_Languages_And_Computation","227316849_Minimal_NFA_problems_are_hard","222388925_Succinct_representation_of_regular_languages_by_boolean_automata_II","221498634_Economy_of_Description_by_Automata_Grammars_and_Formal_Systems","220690044_Introduction_to_Automata_Theory_Languages_and_Computation_Second_Edition","220616460_Relating_the_Type_of_Ambiguity_of_Finite_Automata_to_the_Succinctness_of_Their_Representation","220555539_Some_applications_of_a_technique_of_Sakoda_and_Sipser","220431245_Alternation","220151301_Succint_Representation_of_Regular_Languages_by_Boolean_Automata"]}
