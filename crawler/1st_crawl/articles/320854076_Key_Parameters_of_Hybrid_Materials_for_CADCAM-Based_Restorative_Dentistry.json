{"id":"320854076_Key_Parameters_of_Hybrid_Materials_for_CADCAM-Based_Restorative_Dentistry","abstract":"Hybrid materials are a recent addition to the dental armamentarium for computer-assisted design/ computer-assisted manufacturing (CAD/CAM)-based restorative dentistry. They are intended to provide dentists with the capability of restoring single teeth in one appointment with a material that emulates the structure and physical properties of natural teeth. This article aims to provide an overview of currently available hybrid materials and offer the reader further understanding of their key clinical parameters and possible limitations.","authors":["Sebastian D.
