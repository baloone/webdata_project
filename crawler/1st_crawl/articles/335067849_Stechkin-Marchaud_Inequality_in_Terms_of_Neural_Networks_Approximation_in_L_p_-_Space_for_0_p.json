In the recent years some researchers studied Stechkin-Marchaud type inequalities of Bernstem-Darmeyer operator. In this article we give Stechkin-Marchaud type theorem for an operator we defined it. As a direct consequence we prove a lower bound result for neural networks with ω k ( f i δ ) p .","authors":["Eman Samir Bhaya","Zaineb Hussain Abd Al-sadaa"],"meta":["August 2019IOP Conference Series Materials Science and Engineering 571(1):012020","DOI:10.1088/1757-899X/571/1/012020"],"references":["265580973_Approximation_by_linear_combinations_of_Bernstein-Durrmeyer_operators","265366403_On_Smoothness_Characterized_by_Bernstein_Type_Operators","258687436_Stechkin-Marchaud_Type_Inequalities_in_Lp_for_Linear_Combination_of_Bernstein-Durrmeyer_Operators","245584022_Bernstein_type_operators_and_their_derivatives","239060133_The_Theory_of_Radial_Basis_Function_Approximation_in_1990","226964660_On_the_equivalence_of_the_K-functional_and_moduli_of_continuity_and_some_applications","2283751_Approximation_Theory_of_the_MLP_Model_in_Neural_Networks"]}
