A kinematic analysis of the system is carried out taking into account number of wheel rollers and its real geometry. The accuracy of the algorithm for calculating the coordinates of the mobile platform using odometric information that does not take into account the construction of the wheels is studied. An algorithm is proposed to improve the accuracy of odometric navigation.","authors":["Boris Adamov"],"meta":["May 2018","DOI:10.23919/ICINS.2018.8405889","Conference: 2018 25th Saint Petersburg International Conference on Integrated Navigation Systems (ICINS)","Project: Influence of Construction of Mecanum Wheels on Motion of Omnidirectional Platforms"],"references":["315058609_Modelling_of_Dynamics_of_a_Wheeled_Mobile_Robot_with_Mecanum_Wheels_with_the_use_of_Lagrange_Equations_of_the_Second_Kind","233867057_Practical_applications_for_mobile_robots_based_on_Mecanum_wheels_-_a_systematic_survey","282952259_Heavy-duty_omni-directional_Mecanum-wheeled_robot_for_autonomous_navigation_System_development_and_simulation_realization","269758827_A_description_of_the_dynamics_of_a_four-wheel_Mecanum_mobile_system_as_a_basis_for_a_platform_concept_for_special_purpose_vehicles_for_disabled_persons","245144814_The_dynamics_of_an_omni-mobile_vehicle","225848321_On_the_motion_of_a_mobile_robot_with_roller-carrying_wheels","221786657_Omnidirectional_Mobile_Robot_-_Design_and_Implementation","220221271_Geometry_and_kinematics_of_the_Mecanum_wheel"]}
