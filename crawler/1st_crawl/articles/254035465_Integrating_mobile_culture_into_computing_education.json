{"id":"254035465_Integrating_mobile_culture_into_computing_education","abstract":"The term ‘mobile culture’ describes the evergrowing influence that mobile devices, media and communication have on our day-to-day activities. Current generation of young people is often considered as one of the primary forces helping sustain the evolution of mobile technology, because young people represent a very substantial portion of early adopters and active users of mobile devices, applications, and games. For most college students, electronic gadgets and computer games have always been an integral part of their lives. Consequently, they may perceive mobile devices as true exemplars of the current technology, instead of the desktops that dominate most computer labs. This paper attempts to illustrate the reasons and the possibility of using mobile devices and mobile game development as a learning context and a motivational tool in the computing curriculum.","authors":["Stan A Kurkovsky"],"meta":["March 2012","DOI:10.1109/ISECon.2012.6204173"],"references":["256116297_Mobiles_Everywhere_Youth_the_Mobile_Phone_and_Changes_in_Everyday_Practice","331149811_The_mobile_connection_The_cell_phone's_impact_on_society","275714433_Women's_Way_of_Knowing_The_Development_of_Self_Voice_and_Mind","270009951_Women's_Ways_of_Knowing_The_Development_of_Self_Voice_and_Mind","240320614_The_Mobile_Connection_The_Cell_Phone''s_Impact_on_Society","228936158_Increasing_engagement_and_enrollment_in_breadth-first_introductory_courses_using_authentic_computing_tasks","228647723_Attitudes_towards_computer_science-computing_experiences_as_a_starting_point_and_barrier_to_computer_science","228616509_The_images_of_computing_engaging_undergraduates_in_the_broad_issues_of_computer_science","224088907_Examining_science_and_engineering_students'_attitudes_toward_computer_science","221538105_Why_students_with_an_apparent_aptitude_for_computer_science_don't_choose_to_major_in_computer_science"]}
