{"id":"335532508_Simulation-Based_Training_Promotes_Higher_Levels_of_Cognitive_Control_in_Acute_and_Unforeseen_Situations","abstract":"Background\nSimulation-based training has been recommended to improve patient safety. This study summarizes intensive care nurses' perceptions of what facilitates learning during simulation-based team training in preparation for acute and unforeseen situations.\n\nMethods\nThis study is a literature review with thematic analysis.\n\nResults\nSeven qualitative articles were included. Synthesis with a cognitive perspective revealed six key factors for intensive care nurses' learning: (a) relational coordination, (b) analytical cognition in task management, (c) situational awareness, (d) self-awareness, (e) cognitive control, and (f) high-quality communication within the team.\n\nConclusions\nThe main factor that contributes to learning in simulation-based training is that nurses have cognitive control when time allows the use of analytical thinking.","authors":["Ingunn Pedersen","Anne Lee Solev√•g","Marianne T Solberg"],"meta":["September 2019Clinical Simulation in Nursing 34:6-15","DOI:10.1016/j.ecns.2019.05.003"],"references":["305637060_Quality_management_in_Intensive_Care","304924281_Simulation_in_critical_care","286208053_Preferred_Reporting_Items_for_Systematic_Reviews_and_Meta-Analyses_The_PRISMA_Statement","263390032_Oxygen_and_Ventilator_Treatment_Perspectives_on_Interprofessional_Collaboration_in_a_Neonatal_Intensive_Care_Unit","236085669_Simulation_team_training_for_improved_teamwork_in_an_intensive_care_unit","235930866_Systematic_Approaches_to_a_Successful_Literature_Review","235787329_The_Top_Patient_Safety_Strategies_That_Can_Be_Encouraged_for_Adoption_Now","223963598_Understanding_the_role_of_non-technical_skills_in_patient_safety","23496448_Teamwork_and_patient_safety_in_dynamic_domains_of_healthcare_A_review_of_the_literature","8031908_Cognitive_Continuum_Theory_in_nursing_decision-making","7613777_Features_and_uses_of_high-fidelity_medical_simulations_that_lead_to_effective_learning_A_BEME_systematic_review","7514440_Barriers_to_use_of_simulation-based_education","5413246_Overconfidence_in_Clinical_Decision_Making","5235486_'Methods_for_the_Thematic_Synthesis_of_Qualitative_Research_in_Systematic_Reviews'","317138159_Intensive_care_nursing_students'_perceptions_of_simulation_for_learning_confirming_communication_skills_A_descriptive_qualitative_study","316312593_Quality_Management_in_Intensive_Care_A_Practical_Guide","313187846_Balancing_intertwined_responsibilities_A_grounded_theory_study_of_teamwork_in_everyday_intensive_care_unit_practice","302999996_How_To_Do_a_Sytematic_Literature_Review_in_Nursing_A_Step-By-Step_Guide","280910852_Standard_instruction_versus_simulation_Educating_registered_nurses_in_the_early_recognition_of_patient_deterioration_in_paediatric_critical_care","267205893_New_Directions_for_Relational_Coordination_Theory","261732885_Intensive_care_nurses'_perceptions_of_simulation-based_team_training_for_building_patient_safety_in_intensive_care_A_descriptive_qualitative_study","246399750_Human_Judgment_and_Social_Policy_Irreducible_Uncertainty","235787330_Promoting_a_Culture_of_Safety_as_a_Patient_Safety_Strategy","227934556_An_Exploratory_Study_of_Clinical_Decision-Making_in_Five_Countries","227514864_Impact_of_Relational_Coordination_on_Job_Satisfaction_and_Quality_Outcomes_A_Study_of_Nursing_Homes","221721933_Nurses'_use_of_situation_awareness_in_decision-making_An_integrative_review","45437660_New_Graduate_Nurses'_Perceptions_of_the_Effects_of_Clinical_Simulation_on_Their_Critical_Thinking_Learning_and_Confidence","40696847_Use_of_Simulation_Training_in_the_Intensive_Care_Unit","31710645_Conducting_Research_Literature_Reviews_From_Paper_to_Internet_A_Fink","23669522_The_Role_of_Debriefing_in_Simulation-Based_Learning","10884936_Early_introduction_to_interprofessional_learning_A_simulated_ward_environment","8987786_Low-_to_high-fidelity_simulation_-_A_continuum_of_medical_education","8378505_Simulation--an_efficient_way_of_learning_in_graduate_and_continuous_medical_education"]}
