{"id":"281036033_Single-photon_decision_maker","abstract":"Decision making is critical in our daily lives and for society in general and\nis finding evermore practical applications in information and communication\ntechnologies. Herein, we demonstrate experimentally that single photons can be\nused to make decisions in uncertain, dynamically changing environments. Using a\nnitrogen-vacancy in a nanodiamond as a single-photon source, we demonstrate the\ndecision-making capability by solving the multi-armed bandit problem. This\ncapability is directly and immediately associated with single-photon detection\nin the proposed architecture, leading to adequate and adaptive autonomous\ndecision making. This study makes it possible to create systems that benefit\nfrom the quantum nature of light to perform practical and vital intelligent\nfunctions.","authors":["Makoto Naruse","Martin Berthel","Drezet Aurelien","Serge Huant"],"meta":["August 2015Scientific Reports 5:13253","DOI:10.1038/srep13253","Project: Photonic decision making"],"references":["270946349_An_optical_fiber_network_oracle_for_NP-complete_problems","270905742_Photophysics_of_single_nitrogen-vacancy_centers_in_diamond_nanocrystals","270443256_Amoeba-inspired_algorithm_for_cognitive_medium_access","267039524_Decision_making_based_on_optical_excitation_transfer_via_near-field_interactions_between_quantum_dots","255715069_ERRATUM_Decision_Maker_based_on_Nanoscale_Photo-excitation_Transfer","239634317_Manipulation_of_multiphoton_entanglement_in_waveguide_quantum_circuits","238823756_Intelligence_Maze-Solving_by_an_Amoeboid_Organism","277614392_Read_the_fine_print","263966163_Diamond_nanocrystals_hosting_single_nitrogen-_vacancy_color_centers_sorted_by_photon-correlation_near-field_microscopy","244650798_Single-photon_emitter_using_excitation_energy_transfer_between_quantum_dots"]}
