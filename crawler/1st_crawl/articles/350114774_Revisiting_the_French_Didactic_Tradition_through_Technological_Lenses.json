{"id":"350114774_Revisiting_the_French_Didactic_Tradition_through_Technological_Lenses","abstract":"There is, in France, a long-term tradition of research in the didactics of mathematics. In this paper, we revisit this tradition using, as a specific lens, the research carried out on the educational use of digital tools and resources for teaching and learning mathematics. We first briefly introduce this tradition and the three main theories at the base of it: the theory of didactical situations, the theory of conceptual fields, and the anthropological theory of the didactic. Then, considering three different technological lenses, i.e., dynamic geometry environments, computer algebra systems, and digital resources, we show how these theories and the long-term connection established in this tradition with the fields of cognitive ergonomics and computer sciences have influenced technological research and its outcomes. We also show that, conversely, didactic technological research has led to original and influential theoretical constructions, such as the instrumental approach and the documentational approach to didactics, and that it has contributed in a substantial way to the opening of this didactic tradition to other didactic cultures and other communities, beyond the didactic one.","authors":["Mich√®le Artigue","Luc Trouche"],"meta":["March 2021","DOI:10.3390/math9060629"],"references":["337884551_Une_etude_des_effets_du_travail_documentaire_et_collectif_sur_le_developpement_professionnel_des_enseignants_de_mathematiques_apport_des_concepts_d'experience_et_de_trajectoire_documentaires","331370311_The_French_didactics_tradition_in_mathematics","326467103_Une_reponse_a_la_prise_en_compte_de_l'apprenant_dans_la_TAD_la_praxeologie_personnelle","353230789_Etudier_les_interactions_professeurs-ressources_questions_de_methode","339737853_The_documentational_approach_to_didactics","337823863_A_propos_de_l'apprentissage_des_limites_de_fonctions_dans_un_environnement_calculatrice_etude_des_rapports_entre_processus_d'instrumentation_et_processus_de_conceptualisation","337639152_The_Construct_of_'Resource_System'_as_an_Analytic_Tool_in_Understanding_the_Work_of_Teaching","337639100_Evidencing_Missing_Resources_of_the_Documentational_Approach_to_Didactics_Toward_Ten_Programs_of_ResearchDevelopment_for_Enriching_This_Approach","337414570_Perspectives_on_design_research_the_case_of_didactical_engineering","332547422_L'etude_des_rapports_entre_documentations_individuelle_et_collective_incidents_connaissances_et_ressources_mathematiques"]}
