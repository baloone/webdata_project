{"id":"279038538_Spanning_k-trees_of_Bipartite_Graphs","abstract":"A tree is called a k-tree if its maximum degree is at most k. We prove the following theorem. Let k >= 2 be an integer, and G he a connected bipartite graph with bipartition (A, B) such that |A| <= |B| <= (k - 1) |A| + 1. If sigma(k)(G) >= |B|, then G has a spanning k-tree, where sigma(k)(G) denotes the minimum degree sum of k independent vertices of G. Moreover, the condition on sigma(k) (G) is sharp. It was shown by Win (Abh. Math. Sem. Univ. Hamburg, 43, 263-267, 1975) that if a connected graph H satisfies sigma(k)(H) >= |H| - 1, then H has a spanning k-tree. Thus our theorem shows that the condition becomes much weaker if the graph is bipartite.","authors":["Mikio Kano","Kenta Ozeki","Kazuhiro Suzuki","Masao Tsugaki"],"meta":["January 2015The Electronic Journal of Combinatorics 22(1)","DOI:10.37236/3628"],"references":["225155793_Spanning_Trees_A_Survey","226036779_Existenz_von_Gerusten_mit_Vorgeschriebenem_Maximalgrad_in_Graphen","225683896_On_a_k-Tree_Containing_Specified_Leaves_in_a_Graph","220441683_Spanning_trees_with_bounded_degrees","220342131_Spanning_Trees_of_Bounded_Degree"]}
