{"id":"305888934_Project-based_Learning_in_Virtual_Groups_-_Collaboration_and_Learning_Outcomes_in_a_Virtual_Training_Course_for_Teachers","abstract":"The pressure on the ability of training to teach useful and applied knowledge is growing, as society becomes more competitive and more information consumer. The aim of this research is to show whether the application of a project-based task in virtual groups has led to a greater significant knowledge to participants. Forty teachers who were studying a master program at a fully online institution participated in the study. Teachers worked in groups of 4 or 5 members through forums where they exchanged messages and files during four weeks. They had to carry out a project on how to integrate technology in schools and classes. Three types of knowledge were analyzed: academic, professional and applied. The results of our analysis show significant improvement in all three types of knowledge. Teachers were able to use more ideas, propose more actions and place them in a given context. Our results support project-based learning in virtual environments to foster meaningful learning.","authors":["Consuelo Garcia"],"meta":["July 2016Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences 228:100-105","DOI:10.1016/j.sbspro.2016.07.015"],"references":["307658706_Rich_environments_for_active_learning_in_action_problem-based_learning","306160693_Student_centered_learning_An_insight_into_theory_and_practice","305113689_The_knower_and_the_known_in_teacher_knowledge_research","279741785_To_Take_Them_at_Their_Word_Language_Data_in_the_Study_of_Teachers'_Knowledge","277765128_Online_Project-Based_Learning_How_Collaborative_Strategies_and_Problem_Solving_Processes_Impact_Performance","270960130_The_Atomic_Components_of_Thought","259527696_Transfer_and_transition_in_vocational_education_Some_theoretical_considerations","257171457_Using_Wiki_in_teacher_education_Impact_on_knowledge_management_processes_and_student_satisfaction","256600232_Multiple_Intelligences_The_Theory_in_Practice-A_Reader","247059212_Open_and_Closed_Mathematics_Student_Experiences_and_Understandings"]}
