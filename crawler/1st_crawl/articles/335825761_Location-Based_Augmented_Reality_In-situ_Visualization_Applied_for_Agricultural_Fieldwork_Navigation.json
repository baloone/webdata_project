{"id":"335825761_Location-Based_Augmented_Reality_In-situ_Visualization_Applied_for_Agricultural_Fieldwork_Navigation","abstract":"Nowadays unbalanced crop yield and population growth have led to people worry about a potential future \"Agricultural Crisis\". To increase the arable land-use efficiency, this research has focused on the development of Augmented Reality based Agricultural information visualization and fieldwork navigation tool. This tool has been developed to provide professional aids for farmers' daily fieldwork. To provide continuous fieldwork assistance, this system integrates non-distraction field navigation, the overall visualization of fields and subfields in the form of overlaid polygons, and the detail sensor data visualization for pertinent subfields in the form of Point of Interests. Due to the limitation of current commercially available AR headsets, we first validate this test bench on Virtual Reality video see-through headsets and AR tablets. At this stage, this test bench has only been validated with simulated data. In future, Situated Analytics concepts are planned to be integrated into the system to in-situ visualize real-time data chunks acquired from local sensors, so as to provide timely accurate information and decision support even when the whole dataset is in a high volume.","authors":["Mengya Zheng","Abraham G.
