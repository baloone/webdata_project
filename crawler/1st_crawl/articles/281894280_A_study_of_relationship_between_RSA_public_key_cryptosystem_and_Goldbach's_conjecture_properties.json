{"id":"281894280_A_study_of_relationship_between_RSA_public_key_cryptosystem_and_Goldbach's_conjecture_properties","abstract":"The Goldbach's conjecture has plagued mathematicians for over two hundred and seventy years. Whether professionals or amateur enthusiasts, all have been fascinated by this question. Why do mathematicians have no way to solve this problem? Till now, Chen has been recognized for the most concise proof his \"1 + 2\" theorem in 1973. In this article the authors will use elementary concepts to describe and indirectly prove the Goldbach conjecture.","authors":["C. Liu","C.-C. Chang","Z.-P. Wu","S.-L.
