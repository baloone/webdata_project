{"id":"317649369_Grey_Wolf_Optimization_Applied_to_the_01_Knapsack_Problem","abstract":"The knapsack problem (KP01) in networks is investigated in this paper. A proposed algorithm is presented in order to find the best solution that maximizes the total carried value without exceeding a known capacity using Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) and K-means clustering algorithms. GWO is a recently established meta-heuristics for optimization, inspired by grey wolves. K-means clustering algorithm is used to group each 12 agent with each other at one cluster according to GWO constraint. The performance of the proposed algorithm was evaluated using ORACLE database 11g release 2 and ORACLE Developer 6i.. The simulation results show rapprochement between experimental and theoretical results.","authors":["Eman Yassien","Raja M.T Masadeh","Abdullah Issa Alzaqebah","Ameen Shaheen"],"meta":["July 2017International Journal of Computer Applications 169(5)","DOI:10.5120/ijca2017914734","Project: Grey Wolf Optimization Applied to the 0/1 Knapsack Problem"],"references":["317623186_Grey_wolf_optimization_applied_to_the_maximum_flow_problem","306021086_Comparing_between_different_approaches_to_solve_the_01_Knapsack_problem","264161296_A_reduce_and_solve_approach_for_the_multiple-choice_multidimensional_knapsack_problem","260010809_Grey_Wolf_Optimizer","303155163_A_new_metaheuristic_bat-inspired_algorithm_nature_inspired_cooperative_strategies_for_optimization_NISCO_2010","293642729_Taming_the_01_Knapsack_Problem_with_Monogamous_Pairs_Genetic_Algorithm","273754203_An_Ant_colony_optimization_approach_for_binary_knapsack_problem_under_fuzziness","261960504_A_simplified_binary_artificial_fish_swarm_algorithm_for_0-1_quadratic_knapsack_problems","257636316_Chemical_reaction_optimization_with_greedy_strategy_for_the_0-1_knapsack_problem","255683028_Discrete-Variable_Extremum_Problems"]}
