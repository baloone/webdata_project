{"id":"309092073_Designing_Assessment_Tasks_in_a_Dynamic_Geometry_Environment","abstract":"Despite the widespread use of Dynamic Geometry Environments (DGEs)\nin mathematics classrooms, they feature very little in most teachersâ€™ assessment practices. Indeed, many researchers have acknowledged the lack of research on how DGEs can and should be used in the context of assessment, and on how the learning that is developed through the use of DGEs in mathematics can be evaluated. Digital technologies include a range of mathematical and technological competencies that are not assessed in a paper-and-pencil\nenvironment. Moreover, the feedback provided by DGEs involves a whole new dynamic of action/interaction during assessment. This paper draws on previous work on task design in DGEs to provide a framework for identifying and designing different types of assessment tasks according to the specific goals of the teacher. These types of tasks will be exemplified using tasks designed by the first author for the iPad-based, multi-touch Sketchpad Explorer.","authors":["Marta Venturini","Nathalie Sinclair"],"meta":["October 2017","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-43423-0_5","In book: Digital Technologies in Designing Mathematics Education Tasks (pp.77-98)"],"references":["277614227_Area_Without_Numbers_Using_Touchscreen_Dynamic_Geometry_to_Reason_About_Shape","265885185_Lesson_Plays_Planning_Teaching_vs_Teaching_Planning","248607135_Assessment_for_learning_Assessing_the_theory_and_evidence","226769415_Calculators_in_Mathematics_Education_A_Rapid_Evolution_of_Tools_with_Differential_Effects","291807406_Lesson_play_in_mathematics_education","283521059_Accounting_for_Student_Perspectives_in_Task_Design","240275232_Tensions_and_Tethers_Assessing_Learning_in_Undergraduate_Mathematics","227213292_Micro-Level_Automatic_Assessment_Supported_by_Digital_Technologies","226362055_Integration_of_Technology_in_the_Design_of_Geometry_Tasks_with_Cabri-Geometry","226307523_Some_implications_of_the_results_of_a_case_study_for_the_design_of_pre-constructed_dynamic_geometry_sketches_and_accompanying_materials"]}
