{"id":"313434751_Graphical_Models_and_Belief_Propagation-hierarchy_for_Optimal_Physics-Constrained_Network_Flows","abstract":"In this manuscript we review new ideas and first results on application of the Graphical Models approach, originated from Statistical Physics, Information Theory, Computer Science and Machine Learning, to optimization problems of network flow type with additional constraints related to the physics of the flow. We illustrate the general concepts on a number of enabling examples from power system and natural gas transmission (continental scale) and distribution (district scale) systems.","authors":["Michael Chertkov","Sidhant Misra","Marc Vuffray","Dvijotham Krishnamurty"],"meta":["February 2017"],"references":["306226171_Optimal_Placement_and_Sizing_of_FACTS_Devices_to_Delay_Transmission_Expansion","305228938_How_to_calculate_partition_functions_using_convex_programming_hierarchies_provable_bounds_for_variational_methods","304226031_Graphical_Models_for_Optimal_Power_Flow","311842214_Graphical_models_for_optimal_power_flow","308852523_Temperature-based_instanton_analysis_Identifying_vulnerability_in_transmission_networks","305551886_Modeling_control_and_optimization_of_water_systems_Systems_engineering_methods_for_control_and_decision_making_tasks","304410862_Monotonicity_of_dissipative_flow_networks_renders_robust_maximum_profit_problem_tractable_General_analysis_and_application_to_natural_gas_flows","299416747_Coordinated_Scheduling_for_Interdependent_Electric_Power_and_Natural_Gas_Infrastructures","297906539_OPTIMIZATION_OF_NATURAL-GAS_PIPELINE_SYSTEMS_VIA_DYNAMIC_PROGRAMMING_-_REPLY","295855499_A_differential_analysis_of_the_power_flow_equations"]}
