{"id":"261845590_Upper_bound_on_the_complexity_of_solving_hard_renaming","abstract":"The M-renaming task requires n+1 processes, each starting with a unique input name (from an arbitrary large range), to coordinate the choice of new output names from a range of size M. This paper presents the first upper bound on the complexity of hard renaming, i.e., 2n-renaming, when n+1 is not a prime power. It is known that 2n-renaming can be solved if and only if n+1 is not a prime power; however, the previous proof of the \"if\" part was non-constructive, involving an approximation theorem; in particular, it did not yield a concrete upper bound on the complexity of the resulting protocol.","authors":["Hagit Attiya","Armando Casta√±eda","Maurice Herlihy","Ami Paz"],"meta":["July 2013","DOI:10.1145/2484239.2484251","Conference: Proceedings of the 2013 ACM symposium on Principles of distributed computing"],"references":["234819920_Shavit_N_The_Topological_Structure_of_Asynchronous_Computability_Journal_of_the_ACM_466_858-923","221343665_A_Simple_Algorithmically_Reasoned_Characterization_of_Wait-Free_Computations_Extended_Abstract","221233643_Subconsensus_Tasks_Renaming_Is_Weaker_Than_Set_Agreement","284740505_Theorie_des_Fonctions_Numeriques_Simplement_Periodiques","266523135_Combinatorial_Algebraic_Topology","262353209_Counting-Based_Impossibility_Proofs_for_Renaming_and_Set_Agreement","247816199_A_Simple_Algorithmically_Reasoned_Characterization_of_Wait-free_Computations","239537898_On_the_Computational_Complexity_of_Combinatorial_Problems","221343462_New_Combinatorial_Topology_Upper_and_Lower_Bounds_for_Renaming","221039343_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","220694637_Elements_of_Algebraic_Topology","220566782_New_combinatorial_topology_bounds_for_renaming_the_lower_bound","220431501_Renaming_in_an_Asynchronous_Environment","220064138_The_Renaming_Problem_in_Shared_Memory_Systems_an_Introduction"]}
