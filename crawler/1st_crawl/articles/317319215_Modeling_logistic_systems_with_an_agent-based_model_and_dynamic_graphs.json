{"id":"317319215_Modeling_logistic_systems_with_an_agent-based_model_and_dynamic_graphs","abstract":"This paper is about modeling and simulation of logistic systems. We define them as corridors established between a gateway port, where goods are imported, and urban areas, where the final distributors are located. The efficient management of the flow of goods operated on these corridors requires a structured territory and organized actors. Decentralized decisions of actors and interactions between them make it possible to provide consistent logistic services despite the numerous system constraints (legal, environmental, economical,...).","authors":["Thibaut DÃ©mare","Cyrille Bertelle","Antoine Dutot","Laurent Leveque"],"meta":["June 2017Journal of Transport Geography 62:51 - 65","DOI:10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2017.04.007","Project: Devport"],"references":["318837359_The_Geography_of_Transport_Systems","316587025_On_multiagent_co-ordination_architectures_A_traffic_management_case_study","311594064_Une_approche_systemique_a_base_d'agents_et_de_graphes_dynamiques_pour_modeliser_l'interface_logistique_port-metropole","284205394_A_Survey_of_Agent_Platforms","278701850_Business_Models_and_Network_Design_in_Hinterland_Transport","275068144_Freight_Market_Interactions_Simulation_FREMIS_An_Agent-based_Modeling_Framework","270847642_Recent_Trends_and_Innovations_in_Modelling_City_Logistics","265009061_DELIVERY_SCHEDULE_RELIABILITY_IN_THE_INTERNATIONAL_CONTAINER_LINER_SHIPPING_SERVICE_IMPLICATIONS_FOR_RESEARCH","263557449_The_Geography_of_Global_Supply_Chains_Evidence_from_Third-Party_Logistics","260556440_Transport_operations_in_container_terminals_Literature_overview_trends_research_directions_and_classification_scheme","257640422_Recent_developments_in_national_and_international_freight_transport_models_within_Europe","248989075_Port_competition_modeling_including_maritime_port_and_hinterland_characteristics","245743284_Computational_Methods_for_Dynamic_Graphs","244452451_Agent-based_simulation_of_stakeholders_relations_An_approach_to_sustainable_port_terminal_management","233482037_Incorporating_Logistics_in_Freight_Transport_Demand_Models_State-of-the-Art_and_Research_Opportunities","225504130_State-of-the_art_of_freight_forecast_modeling_Lessons_learned_and_the_road_ahead","222432907_Algorithmic_Techniques_for_Maintaining_Shortest_Routes_in_Dynamic_Networks","221524111_GAMA_A_Simulation_Platform_That_Integrates_Geographical_Information_Data_Agent-Based_Modeling_and_Multi-scale_Control","216300484_Distributed_Optimization_by_Ant_Colonies","29638806_GraphStream_A_Tool_for_bridging_the_gap_between_Complex_Systems_and_Dynamic_Graphs","329052672_Defining_and_Estimating_a_Trading_Area","313312368_Agent_Theories_Architectures_and_Languages_A_Survey","280566512_Networks_An_Introduction","275620232_Theory_of_Self-Reproducing_Automata","272557751_An_activity-based_freight_mode_choice_microsimulation_model","269739858_Defining_and_Estimating_a_Trade_Area","266360773_Graph_Theory_and_Its_Application","264889231_TAPAS_A_multi-agent-based_model_for_simulation_of_transport_chains","262937509_Storage_pricing_strategies_for_import_container_terminals_under_stochastic_conditions","260030501_Analysis_of_mode_choice_variables_in_short-distance_intermodal_freight_transport_using_an_agent-based_model","259125971_Novel_multi-objective_resource_allocation_and_activity_scheduling_for_fourth_party_logistics","248786770_Modelling_the_Dynamics_of_Supply_Chain_A_Multi_Agent_Approach","247898912_A_behavioral_freight_movement_microsimulation_model_Method_and_data","247074873_Optimization_Learning_and_Natural_Algorithms","242344183_Collaborative_Logistics_Management_and_the_Role_of_Third-Party_Service_Providers","239667766_Simulation_for_the_Social_Scientist","239329104_A_Multi-Agent_Systems_Perspective_on_Intermodal_Transport_Chains","238674332_Multi-agent_systems_an_introduction_to_distributed_artificial_intelligence_addison-wesley","229569970_A_DSS_For_Modelling_Logistic_Chains_in_Freight_Transport_Policy_Analysis","229348772_A_multi-agent_based_framework_for_supply_chain_risk_management","228770904_On_models_and_algorithms_for_dynamic_communication_networks_The_case_for_evolving_graphs","226418735_Structural_parameters_of_communication_networks","223707043_Supply_Chain_Integration_With_Third-Party_Logistics_Providers","223054829_A_conceptual_framework_for_agent-based_modelling_of_logistics_services","222712687_Agent-based_Simulation_Platforms_Review_and_Development_Recommendations","222649741_Agent-Based_Approaches_to_Transport_Logistics","222560600_Fully_dynamic_all-pairs_shortest_paths_with_real_weights","221498171_Fully_Dynamic_All_Pairs_Shortest_Paths_with_Real_Edge_Weights","200134796_Simulating_Societies_The_Computer_Simulation_of_Social_Phenomena","30421560_Survey_of_Agent_Based_Modelling_and_Simulation_Tools"]}
