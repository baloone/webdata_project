It was showed that correlation coefficients for all the journal metrics of the first group of journals (Economics journals) were higher than the similar coefficients in the second group of journals (Mathematics and Computer Science journals). It was obtained that the mean observation of the journal metrics for the first group of journals come up to the inequalities IF>SJR>SNIP with a small spread of the mean values, as for the second group of the journal metrics the following inequalities takes place: SNIP>IF>SJR","authors":["Vladimir M Moskovkin","Alla A.
