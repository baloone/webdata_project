{"id":"224843989_IMPLEMENTATION_OF_A_SIGMOID_ACTIVATION_FUNCTION_FOR_NEURAL_NETWORK_USING_FPGA","abstract":"In this paper, the design of a single neuron which contains a sigmoid activation function was proposed and implemented using the FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Array) techniques. The main goal of this neuron design is to enable use of any numbers of this neuron that its activation function type is sigmoid function. Furthermore, its goal is design any neural network with any number of hidden layers with a different number of this neuron and any number of output neurons, in easy manner using FPGA. Therefore, this implementation neuron can be use in any application that requires FPGA technique. A single neuron is designed using a schematic editor on Xilinx Foundation Series.","authors":["Thamer Muhammed Jamel","Ban Mohammed"],"meta":["April 2012","Conference: 13th Scientific Conference of Al-Ma'moon University CollegeVolume: 13"],"references":["284034385_Implementation_of_a_Neuron_Using_FPGAS","265179275_Implementation_of_Back_Propagation_Algorithm_in_Verilog","228618304_Digital_Implementation_of_The_Sigmoid_Function_for_FPGA_Circuits","348600295_MODELLING_A_NEURON_USING_A_CUSTOM_MATH_LIBRARY_SFLOAT24_-_IMPLEMENTATION_OF_A_SIGMOID_FUNCTION_ON_A_FPGA_DEVIC","222874051_Using_and_designing_massively_parallel_computers_for_neural_networks","3887142_A_neural_network_FPGA_implementation"]}
