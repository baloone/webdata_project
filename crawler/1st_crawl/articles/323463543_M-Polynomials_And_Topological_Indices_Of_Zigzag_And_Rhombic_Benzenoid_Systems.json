{"id":"323463543_M-Polynomials_And_Topological_Indices_Of_Zigzag_And_Rhombic_Benzenoid_Systems","abstract":"M-polynomial of different molecular structures helps to calculate many topological indices. This polynomial is a new idea and its beauty is the wealth of information it contains about the closed forms of degree-based topological indices of molecular graph G of the structure. It is a well-known fact that topological indices play significant role in determining properties of the chemical compound [1, 2, 3, 4]. In this article, we computed the closed form of M-polynomial of zigzag and rhombic benzenoid systemsbecause of their extensive usages in industry. Moreover we give graphs of M-polynomials and their relations with the parameters of structures.","authors":["Ashaq Ali","Waqas Nazeer","Mobeen Munir","Shin Min Kang"],"meta":["February 2018Open Chemistry 16(1)","DOI:10.1515/chem-2018-0010"],"references":["323103624_Computing_topological_indices_of_Hex_Board_and_its_line_graph","321709444_Computing_sanskrti_index_of_Titania_Nanotubes_393","320087463_THE_GENERALIZED_ZAGREB_INDEX_OF_CAPRA-DESIGNED_PLANAR_BENZENOID_SERIES_CakC6_374","318567085_M-polynomials_and_topological_indices_of_silicate_and_oxide_networks","316567849_The_first_multiplication_atom-bond_connectivity_index_of_molecular_structures_in_drugs","314104311_Molecular_description_of_Copper_Oxide_CuO_321","312328342_Some_Topological_Invariants_of_the_Mobius_Ladders","312023559_Some_Computational_Aspects_of_Boron_Triangular_Nanotubes","311455848_M-Polynomial_and_Degree-Based_Topological_Indices_of_Polyhex_Nanotubes","314104610_On_the_edge-version_atom-bond_connectivity_and_geometric_arithmetic_indices_of_certain_graph_operations_183"]}
