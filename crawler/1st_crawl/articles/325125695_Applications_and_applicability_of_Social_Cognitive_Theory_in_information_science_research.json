{"id":"325125695_Applications_and_applicability_of_Social_Cognitive_Theory_in_information_science_research","abstract":"Social Cognitive Theory is a theory that derives from Psychology yet has been adopted in other interdisciplinary subject areas, including information science. The origins and key concepts of Social Cognitive Theory are presented, and the value of its contributions to information science research analysed, with particular reference to research into information-seeking behaviour and use and knowledge sharing. Prior applications of Social Cognitive Theory in information science research are related to a study of employee-led workplace learning and innovative work behaviour that has been designed to create new insight on: (1) workplace information literacy; (2) knowledge management; and (3) the relationship between information behaviours and innovation processes. It is anticipated that this research will also extend understandings of Social Cognitive Theory as a valuable tool for theory development across a range of domains that focus on learning processes.","authors":["Lyndsey Middleton","Hazel Hall","Robert Raeside"],"meta":["May 2018Journal of Librarianship and Information Science
