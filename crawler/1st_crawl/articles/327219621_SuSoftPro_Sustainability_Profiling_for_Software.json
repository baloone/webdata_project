{"id":"327219621_SuSoftPro_Sustainability_Profiling_for_Software","abstract":"The paper presents a SuSoftPro tool for requirement engineers to analyse the requirements' impacts on system sustainability. To perform the analysis of system sustainability, the tool provides quantitative questionnaires for rating high- level requirements within sustainability dimensions via a Fuzzy Rating Scale method. Stakeholders' responses are analysed by applying Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution. The tool presents sustainability as a five-star rating label, a visualisation of the degree for sustainability dimensions, and a bar graph that illustrates the sustainability level.","authors":["Ahmed D.
