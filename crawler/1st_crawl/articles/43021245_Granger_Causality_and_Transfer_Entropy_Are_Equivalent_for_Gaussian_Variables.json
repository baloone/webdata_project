{"id":"43021245_Granger_Causality_and_Transfer_Entropy_Are_Equivalent_for_Gaussian_Variables","abstract":"Granger causality is a statistical notion of causal influence based on\nprediction via vector autoregression. Developed originally in the field of\neconometrics, it has since found application in a broader arena, particularly\nin neuroscience. More recently transfer entropy, an information-theoretic\nmeasure of time-directed information transfer between jointly dependent\nprocesses, has gained traction in a similarly wide field. While it has been\nrecognized that the two concepts must be related, the exact relationship has\nuntil now not been formally described. Here we show that for Gaussian\nvariables, Granger causality and transfer entropy are entirely equivalent, thus\nbridging autoregressive and information-theoretic approaches to data-driven\ncausal inference.","authors":["Lionel Barnett","Adam B Barrett","Anil K Seth"],"meta":["December 2009Physical Review Letters 103(23):238701","DOI:10.1103/PhysRevLett.103.238701","SourcePubMed"],"references":["275625404_The_Advanced_Theory_of_Statistics","265457376_The_Measurement_of_Linear_Dependence_and_Feedback_Between_Multiple_Time_Series","265352649_Causality_Models_reasoning_and_inference_second_edition","256720289_Economic_Processes_Involving_Feedback","247748318_The_Advanced_Theory_of_Statistics_2","243766439_The_Analysis_of_Multiple_Stationary_Time-Series","243075018_Tests_of_Statistical_Hypotheses_Concerning_Several_Parameters_When_the_Number_of_Observations_Is_Large","222532068_Analyzing_Multiple_Nonlinear_Time_Series_with_Extended_Granger_Causality","221932985_Matrix_Analysis","200705602_Probability_Random_Variables_and_Stochastic_Process"]}
