{"id":"341168342_Knowledge_Graph_Semantic_Enhancement_of_Input_Data_for_Improving_AI","abstract":"Intelligent systems designed using machine learning algorithms require a large number of labeled data. Background knowledge provides complementary, real-world factual information that can augment the limited labeled data to train a machine learning algorithm. The term Knowledge Graph (KG) is in vogue as for many practical applications, it is convenient and useful to organize this background knowledge in the form of a graph. Recent academic research and implemented industrial intelligent systems have shown promising performance for machine learning algorithms that combine training data with a knowledge graph. In this article, we discuss the use of relevant KGs to enhance the input data for two applications that use machine learningâ€”recommendation and community detection. The KG improves both accuracy and explainability.","authors":["Shreyansh Bhatt","Amit Sheth","Valerie L.
