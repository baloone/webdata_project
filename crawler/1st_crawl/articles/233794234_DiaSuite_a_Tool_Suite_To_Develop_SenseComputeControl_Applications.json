{"id":"233794234_DiaSuite_a_Tool_Suite_To_Develop_SenseComputeControl_Applications","abstract":"We present DiaSuite, a tool suite that uses a software design approach to drive the development process. DiaSuite focuses on a specific domain, namely Sense/Compute/Control (SCC) applications. It comprises a domain-specific design language, a compiler producing a Java programming framework, a 2D-renderer to simulate an application, and a deployment framework. We have validated our tool suite on a variety of concrete applications in areas including telecommunications, building automation, robotics and avionics.","authors":["Benjamin Bertran","Julien Bruneau","Damien Cassou","Nicolas Loriant"],"meta":["January 2012Science of Computer Programming 79","DOI:10.1016/j.scico.2012.04.001"],"references":["234819373_The_design_and_applications_of_a_context_service","228899517_Preliminary_Results_in_Virtual_Testing_for_Smart_Buildings_Poster","224152594_SIP_as_a_Universal_Communication_Bus_A_Methodology_and_an_Experimental_Study","224140745_A_Tool_Suite_to_Prototype_Pervasive_Computing_Applications_Demo","224092243_A_SIP-Based_Home_Automation_Platform_An_Experimental_Study","221966163_Toward_a_Tool-Based_Development_Methodology_for_Pervasive_Computing_Applications","221321627_A_Domain-Specific_Approach_to_Architecturing_Error_Handling_in_Pervasive_Computing","221036619_Olympus_A_High-Level_Programming_Model_for_Pervasive_Computing_Environments","220377543_BDTEX_A_GQM-based_Bayesian_approach_for_the_detection_of_antipatterns","220031547_A_playerstage_system_for_context-aware_intelligent_environments","51937409_Using_the_DiaSpec_design_language_and_compiler_to_develop_roboticssystems","50917432_Architecturing_Conflict_Handling_of_Pervasive_Computing_Resources","48415306_A_Step-Wise_Approach_for_Integrating_QoS_throughout_Software_Development","47805629_Leveraging_Architectures_to_Guide_and_Verify_Development_of_SenseComputeControl_Applications","29601232_A_Taxonomy-Driven_Approach_to_Visually_Prototyping_Pervasive_Computing_Applications","29601175_A_Generative_Programming_Approach_to_Developing_Pervasive_Computing_Systems","4120078_A_testbed_for_evaluating_human_interaction_with_ubiquitous_computing_environments","4075060_SENS_A_sensor_environment_and_network_simulator","4011318_Providing_contextual_information_to_pervasive_computing_applications","2870717_A_Conceptual_Framework_and_a_Toolkit_for_Supporting_the_Rapid_Prototyping_of_Context-Aware_Applications","2579237_Advanced_Interaction_in_Context","281014631_Leveraging_Software_Architectures_to_Guide_and_Verify_the_Development_of_SenseComputeControl_Applications","261131077_Software_Architecture_Foundations_Theory_and_Practice","247190852_Player_20_Toward_a_Practical_Robot_Programming_Framework","244440797_RFC_3261SIP_Session_initiation_protocol","243781648_SIP_session_Initiation_Protocol","242387884_UBIWISE_A_Ubiquitous_Wireless_Infrastructure_Simulation_Environment","224692452_A_Generic_Large_Scale_Simulator_for_Ubiquitous_Computing","224441234_DiaSim_A_Simulator_for_Pervasive_Computing_Applications","222001027_Towards_the_Model_Driven_Development_of_context-aware_pervasive_systems","221554540_Archface_A_contract_place_where_architectural_design_and_code_meet_together","221321303_The_JastAdd_Extensible_Java_Compiler","220299925_Evaluating_a_Location-Based_Application_A_Hybrid_Test_and_Simulation_Environment","220131029_Enforcing_Structural_Regularities_in_Software_using_IntensiVE","200622137_Software_Architecture_Foundations_Theory_and_Practice","200040469_The_Definitive_ANTLR_Reference_Building_Domain-specific_Languages","4123912_Applying_a_Disciplined_Approach_to_the_Development_of_a_Context-Aware_Communication_Application","4061311_A_software_engineering_framework_for_context-aware_pervasive_computing","3958195_Context_Aggregation_and_Dissemination_in_Ubiquitous_Computing_Systems","3436932_Project_Aura_Toward_Distraction-free_Pervasive_Computing","3187747_An_Event-Based_Architecture_Definition_Language","2956483_Guest_Editor's_Introduction_Model-Driven_Engineering","2592883_Shaw_M_Beyond_Objects_A_Software_Design_Paradigm_based_on_Process_Control_ACM_Software_Engineering_Notes_201_27-38"]}
