{"id":"326029013_Digital_Twin_Service_towards_Smart_Manufacturing","abstract":"Digital twin provides an effective way for the cyber-physical integration of manufacturing. Meanwhile, smart manufacturing services could optimize the entire business processes and operation procedure of manufacturing, to achieve a new higher level of productivity. The combination of smart manufacturing services and digital twin would radically change product design, manufacturing, usage, MRO and other processes. Combined with the services, the digital twin will generate more reasonable manufacturing planning and precise production control to help achieve smart manufacturing, through the two-way connectivity between the virtual and physical worlds of manufacturing. This paper specifies and highlights how manufacturing services and digital twin are converged together and the various components of digital twin are used by manufacturers in the form of services.","authors":["Qinglin Qi","Fei Tao","Ying Zuo","Dongming Zhao"],"meta":["June 2018Procedia CIRP 72","DOI:10.1016/j.procir.2018.03.103","Conference: 51st CIRP Conference on Manufacturing Systems"],"references":["323397001_Digital_twin-driven_product_design_framework","322566556_Data-driven_smart_manufacturing","322512249_Digital_Twin_and_Big_Data_Towards_Smart_Manufacturing_and_Industry_40_360_Degree_Comparison","320225400_Theory_and_technologies_for_cyber-physical_fusion_in_digital_twin_shop-floor_shuziluanshengchejianxinxiwulironghelilunyujishu","320025921_Digital_Twin_Shop-Floor_A_New_Shop-Floor_Paradigm_Towards_Smart_Manufacturing","318694164_New_IT_Driven_Service-Oriented_Smart_Manufacturing_Framework_and_Characteristics","315328118_Digital_twin-driven_product_design_manufacturing_and_service_with_big_data","306009579_A_cloud-based_production_system_for_information_and_service_integration_an_internet_of_things_case_study_on_waste_electronics","320176112_IIHub_An_Industrial_Internet-of-Things_Hub_Toward_Smart_Manufacturing_Based_on_Cyber-Physical_System","307860371_SDMSim_A_manufacturing_service_supply-demand_matching_simulator_under_cloud_environment"]}
