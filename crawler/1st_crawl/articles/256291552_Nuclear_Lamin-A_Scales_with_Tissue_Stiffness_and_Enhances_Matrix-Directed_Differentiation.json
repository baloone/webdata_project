{"id":"256291552_Nuclear_Lamin-A_Scales_with_Tissue_Stiffness_and_Enhances_Matrix-Directed_Differentiation","abstract":"Tissues can be soft like fat, which bears little stress, or stiff like bone, which sustains high stress, but whether there\nis a systematic relationship between tissue mechanics and differentiation is unknown. Here, proteomics analyses revealed that\nlevels of the nucleoskeletal protein lamin-A scaled with tissue elasticity, E, as did levels of collagens in the extracellular matrix that determine E. Stem cell differentiation into fat on soft matrix was enhanced by low lamin-A levels, whereas differentiation into bone\non stiff matrix was enhanced by high lamin-A levels. Matrix stiffness directly influenced lamin-A protein levels, and, although\nlamin-A transcription was regulated by the vitamin A/retinoic acid (RA) pathway with broad roles in development, nuclear entry\nof RA receptors was modulated by lamin-A protein. Tissue stiffness and stress thus increase lamin-A levels, which stabilize\nthe nucleus while also contributing to lineage determination.","authors":["Joe Swift","Irena L Ivanovska","Amnon
