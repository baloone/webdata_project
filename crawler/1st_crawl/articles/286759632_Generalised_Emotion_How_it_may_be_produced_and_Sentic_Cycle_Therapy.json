{"id":"286759632_Generalised_Emotion_How_it_may_be_produced_and_Sentic_Cycle_Therapy","abstract":"In this chapter we are concerned with a novel, yet natural way of producing emotions using dynamic expression and touch as a mode for the precise expression of emotions, and as a special, new art form. This way is outside the life-line of an individual, i.e., does not depend on events happening to that person, is controllable, easily achieved, tells us much about the nature of emotion and its communication â€” and results in preventive and therapeutic applications for emotional balance.","authors":["Manfred Clynes"],"meta":["January 1988","DOI:10.1007/978-1-4757-1987-1_6","In book: Emotions and Psychopathology (pp.107-170)"],"references":["263258420_Toward_a_General_Sociological_Theory_of_Emotions","232603109_Remembering_what_you_feel_Effects_of_emotion_on_memory","232497143_Cognitive_consequences_of_emotional_arousal","229219957_A_Perceptual-Motor_Theory_of_Emotion","229060002_The_Relationship_of_Emotion_to_Cognition_A_Functional_Approach_to_a_Semantic_Controversy","19257755_An_Attributional_Theory_of_Achievement_Motivation_and_Emotion","313721876_Expressive_microstructure_in_music_linked_to_living_qualities","313166337_Emotion-cognition_relationships_and_human_development","300516518_Toward_a_Theory_of_Man_Precision_of_Essentic_Form_in_Living_Communication","290271028_THE_COMMUNICATION_OF_EMOTION_THEORY_OF_SENTICS","285103756_The_Living_Quality_of_Music","284760297_Expression_and_the_nature_of_emotion_in_Approaches_to_Emotion","284296864_Communication_and_generation_of_emotion_through_essentic_form","279236940_Neurobiologic_Functions_of_Rhythm_Time_and_Pulse_in_Music","274810668_Emotion_A_Psychoevolutionary_Synthesis","270271394_Mood_and_Memory","267550844_Generative_Principles_of_Musical_Thought_Integration_of_Microstructure_with_Structure","244956329_A_General_Psychoevolutionary_Theory_of_Emotion","238718349_Sentics_The_Touch_of_Emotions","232530260_Selective_learning_caused_by_affective_states","231879851_Toward_a_general_psychobiological_theory_of_emotions","229060039_Emotion_A_Psychoevolutionary_Synthesis","227924906_Information-Processing_Models_of_Cognition","222336704_Sentography_Dynamic_forms_of_communication_of_emotion_and_qualities","202304374_Feeling_and_thinking_Preferences_need_no_inferences","200806083_Music_as_Time's_Measure","22519932_Affect_accessibility_of_material_in_memory_and_behavior_A_cognitive_loop","19533180_The_Cognitive_Unconscious","19183501_Brain_Evolution_Relating_to_Family_Play_and_the_Separation_Call","18650128_Sentics_biocybernetics_of_emotion_communication","17911108_Cybernetic_Implications_of_Rein_Control_in_Perceptual_and_Conceptual_Organization","17108029_Further_Studies_on_the_Effects_of_Amygdaloid_Stimulation_and_Ablation_on_Hypothalamically_Elicited_Attack_Behavior_in_Cats","16584658_Autonomic_Nervous_System_Activity_Distinguishes_Among_Emotions","9873245_Unidirectional_rate_sensitivity_A_biocybernetic_law_of_reflex_and_humoral_systems_as_physiologic_channels_of_control_and_communication","9675492_Organization_of_the_subcortical_system_governing_defence_and_flight_reaction_in_the_cat","9544998_The_non-linear_biological_dynamics_of_unidirectional_rate_sensitivity_illustrated_by_analog_computer_analysis_pupillary_reflex_to_light_and_sound_and_heart_rate_behavior","5521426_Information_Processing_Models_of_Cognition"]}
