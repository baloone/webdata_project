{"id":"342042913_Graphs_that_are_cospectral_for_the_distance_Laplacian","abstract":"The distance matrix $\\mathcal{D}(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the matrix containing the pairwise distances between vertices, and the distance Laplacian matrix is $\\mathcal{D}^L (G)=T(G)-\\mathcal{D} (G)$, where $T(G)$ is the diagonal matrix of row sums of $\\mathcal{D}(G)$. Several general methods are established for producing $\\mathcal{D}^L$-cospectral graphs that can be used to construct infinite families. Examples are provided to show that various properties are not preserved by $\\mathcal{D}^L$-cospectrality, including examples of $\\mathcal{D}^L$-cospectral strongly regular and circulant graphs. It is established that the absolute values of coefficients of the distance Laplacian characteristic polynomial are decreasing, i.e., $|\\delta^L_{1}|\\geq \\cdots \\geq |\\delta^L_{n}|$, where $\\delta^L_{k}$ is the coefficient of $x^k$.","authors":["Boris Brimkov","Ken Duna","Leslie Hogben","Kate Lorenzen"],"meta":["June 2020The electronic journal of linear algebra ELA 36(36):334-351","DOI:10.13001/ela.2020.4941"],"references":[]}
