{"id":"313656217_CLUSTER_COMPUTING_VS_CLOUD_COMPUTING_A_COMPARISON_AND_AN_OVERVIEW_1","abstract":"In the field of Information technology cloud computing appears as one of the demanding, result oriented and latest topics. Here it is stated that cloud computing is based on several areas of computer science research, such as virtualization, HPC, grid computing and utility computing. One method of computer is called cloud computing, which shares the majority of the Internetwork computer resources instead of via software or storage on local computers. To distribute their work in many rooms and then run these separate parts simultaneously in a computer group is a method to create an application run more rapidly. Cluster computing is the move toward that has been applied with applications of technical and scientific standpoint. In this article, we have done everything possible to judge against and distinguish with cluster and cloud computing from multiple points of view and to facilitate understanding of the important features of both.","authors":["Makhdoom Muhammad Naeem","Hidayatullah Mahar","Furqan Memon","Muhammad Siddique"],"meta":["December 2016"],"references":["271531358_Comparison_between_Cloud_Computing_Grid_Computing_Cluster_Computing_and_Virtualization","225252747_Cloud_Computing_State-of-the-art_and_Research_Challenges","220618720_Cloud_Computing_a_Perspective_Study","311344281_A_survey_on_security_issues_in_service_delivery_models_of_cloud_computing","273577059_Cluster_Grid_and_Cloud_Computing_A_Detailed_Comparison","222410212_Cloud_Computing_and_Emerging_IT_Platforms_Vision_Hype_and_Reality_for_Delivering_Computing_as_the_5th_Utility"]}
