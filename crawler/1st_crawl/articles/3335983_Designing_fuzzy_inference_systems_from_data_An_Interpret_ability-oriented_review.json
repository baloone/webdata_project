{"id":"3335983_Designing_fuzzy_inference_systems_from_data_An_Interpret_ability-oriented_review","abstract":"Fuzzy inference systems (FIS) are widely used for process\nsimulation or control. They can be designed either from expert knowledge\nor from data. For complex systems, FIS based on expert knowledge only\nmay suffer from a loss of accuracy. This is the main incentive for using\nfuzzy rules inferred from data. Designing a FIS from data can be\ndecomposed into two main phases: automatic rule generation and system\noptimization. Rule generation leads to a basic system with a given space\npartitioning and the corresponding set of rules. System optimization can\nbe done at various levels. Variable selection can be an overall\nselection or it can be managed rule by rule. Rule base optimization aims\nto select the most useful rules and to optimize rule conclusions. Space\npartitioning can be improved by adding or removing fuzzy sets and by\ntuning membership function parameters. Structure optimization is of a\nmajor importance: selecting variables, reducing the rule base and\noptimizing the number of fuzzy sets. Over the years, many methods have\nbecome available for designing FIS from data. Their efficiency is\nusually characterized by a numerical performance index. However, for\nhuman-computer cooperation another criterion is needed: the rule\ninterpretability. An implicit assumption states that fuzzy rules are by\nnature easy to be interpreted. This could be wrong when dealing with\ncomplex multivariable systems or when the generated partitioning is\nmeaningless for experts. The paper analyzes the main methods for\nautomatic rule generation and structure optimization. They are grouped\ninto several families and compared according to the rule\ninterpretability criterion. For this purpose, three conditions for a set\nof rules to be interpretable are defined","authors":["Serge Guillaume"],"meta":["July 2001IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems 9(3):426 - 443","DOI:10.1109/91.928739","SourceIEEE Xplore"],"references":["331859310_Exemple_de_capteur_symbolique_flou_en_reconnaissance_des_couleurs","313511532_A_new_approach_to_fuzzy_modeling","313312215_Orthogonal_least_squares_methods_and_their_application_to_non-linear_system_identification","313215770_A_fuzzy-logic-based_approach_to_qualitative_modeling","313066777_Fuzzy_identification_of_systems_and_its_application_to_modeling_and_control","304938326_Generation_of_Fuzzy_Rules_by_Mountain_Clustering","292797301_A_possibilistic_approach_of_clustering","286786328_Un_reseau_Neuro-Flou_evolutif","284026466_Generating_fuzzy_rules_by_learning_from_examples","283996103_Genetic_Algorithms_In_Search_Optimization_and_Machine_Learning"]}
