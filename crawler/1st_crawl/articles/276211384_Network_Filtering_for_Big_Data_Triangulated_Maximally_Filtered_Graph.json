{"id":"276211384_Network_Filtering_for_Big_Data_Triangulated_Maximally_Filtered_Graph","abstract":"We establish a formal connection between algorithmic correspondence theory and certain dual characterization results for finite\nlattices, similar to Nationâ€™s characterization of a hierarchy of pseudovarieties of finite lattices, progressively generalizing\nfinite distributive lattices. This formal connection is mediated through monotone modal logic. Indeed, we adapt the correspondence\nalgorithm ALBA to the setting of monotone modal logic, and we use a certain duality-induced encoding of finite lattices as\nmonotone neighbourhood frames to translate lattice terms into formulas in monotone modal logic.","authors":["Guido Mario Previde Massara","Tiziana Di Matteo","Tomaso Aste"],"meta":["May 2015","DOI:10.1093/comnet/cnw015","SourcearXiv"],"references":["267214401_Risk_diversification_a_study_of_persistence_with_a_filtered_correlation-network_approach","262841110_Relation_between_Financial_Market_Structure_and_the_Real_Economy_Comparison_between_Clustering_Methods","321514881_Algorithms_and_Combinatorics","321502462_Lectures_on_Algebraic_Statistics","308308434_Submodular_function_maximization_Tractability_Pract","306157654_Shortest_Connection_Networks_and_Some_Generalizations","302009575_Graph_Algorithms","285996477_Submodular_Function_Maximization","267728315_Networks_in_financial_markets_based_on_the_mutual_information_rate","263658605_Planar_Graphs_Theory_and_Algorithms"]}
