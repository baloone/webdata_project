{"id":"315325200_Motion_of_level_sets_by_mean_curvature_I","abstract":"We construct a unique weak solution of the nonlinear PDE which asserts each level set evolves in time according to its mean curvature. This weak solution allows us then to define for any compact set Γ0 a unique generalized motion by mean curvature, existing for all time. We investigate the various geometric properties and pathologies of this evolution. © 1991, International Press of Boston, Inc. All Rights Reserved.","authors":["L. C.
