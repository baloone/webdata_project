{"id":"326749633_A_Branch-and-Bound_Based_Exact_Algorithm_for_the_Maximum_Edge-Weight_Clique_Problem","abstract":"The maximum edge-weight clique problem is to find a clique whose sum of edge-weight is maximum for a given edge-weighted undirected graph. The problem is NP-hard and was formulated as a mathematical programming problem in previous studies. In this paper, we propose an exact algorithm based on branch-and-bound. By some computational experiments, we confirmed our proposal algorithm is faster than the methods based on mathematical programming.","authors":["Satoshi Shimizu","Kazuaki Yamaguchi","Sumio Masuda"],"meta":["January 2019","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-96806-3_3","In book: Computational Science/Intelligence & Applied Informatics (pp.27-47)","Project: combinatorial optimization, discrete optimization, graph algorithm, branch and bound"],"references":["314262777_Fast_maximum_weight_clique_extraction_algorithm_Optimal_tables_for_branch-and-bound","303562129_A_Much_Faster_Branch-and-Bound_Algorithm_for_Finding_a_Maximum_Clique","267125000_Optimal_results_and_tight_bounds_for_the_Maximum_Diversity_Problem","255587816_A_New_Exact_Algorithm_for_the_Maximum_Weight_Clique_Problem","250261436_A_Test_Suite_for_Combinatorial_Auctions","235890405_Improvements_to_MCS_algorithm_for_the_maximum_clique_problem","319231673_On_Maximum_Weight_Clique_Algorithms_and_How_They_Are_Evaluated","314033019_On_Minimization_of_the_Number_of_Branches_in_Branch-and-Bound_Algorithms_for_the_Maximum_Clique_Problem","301727884_An_Exact_Algorithm_Based_on_MaxSAT_Reasoning_for_the_Maximum_Weight_Clique_Problem","267337357_Solving_the_maximum_edge-weight_clique_problem_in_sparse_graphs_with_compact_formulations"]}
