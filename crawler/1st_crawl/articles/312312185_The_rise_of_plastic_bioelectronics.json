{"id":"312312185_The_rise_of_plastic_bioelectronics","abstract":"Plastic bioelectronics is a research field that takes advantage of the inherent properties of polymers and soft organic electronics for applications at the interface of biology and electronics. The resulting electronic materials and devices are soft, stretchable and mechanically conformable, which are important qualities for interacting with biological systems in both wearable and implantable devices. Work is currently aimed at improving these devices with a view to making the electronicâ€“biological interface as seamless as possible.","authors":["Takao Someya","Zhenan Bao","George G.
