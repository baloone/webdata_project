The natural frequencies of vibration and the corresponding mode shapes were obtained for various ply stacking sequences in ABAQUS structural solver and results are compared with experimental data 1. Unsteady coupled FSI simulations are performed at two different velocities near the experimental flutter boundary and the results are post-processed to predict the flutter speed. The predicted flutter speed by the coupled simulation using STAR-CCM+-ABAQUS co-simulation are found to be closely matching with that of experimental and analytical data.","authors":["Harendra K Verma","Ayan Nath","Kiran Voonna"],"meta":["August 2015","Conference: The Aeronautical Society of India: CFD SymposiumAt: National Aerospace Laboratories, BangaloreVolume: 17","Project: Fluid Structure Interaction Analysis using Star-CCM+ and ABAQUS"],"references":["282735426_Flutter_and_Divergence_Characteristics_of_Composite_Plate_Wing","245428729_Aeroelastic_flutter_and_divergence_of_stiffness_coupled_graphiteepoxy_cantilevered_plates","242077112_CFD-Based_Nonlinear_Computational_Aeroelasticity"]}
