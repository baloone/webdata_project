{"id":"221047644_Shared_Event_CompositionDecomposition_in_Event-B","abstract":"The construction of specifications is often a combination of smaller sub-components. Composition and decomposition are techniques supporting reuse and allowing formal combination of sub-components through refinement steps. Sub-components can result from a design or architectural goal and a refinement framework should allow them to be further developed, possibly in parallel. We propose the definition of composition and decomposition in the Event-B formalism following a shared event approach where sub-components interact via synchronised shared events and shared states are not allowed. We define the necessary proof obligations to ensure valid compositions and decompositions. We also show that shared event composition preserves refinement proofs, that is, in order to maintain refinement of compositions, it is sufficient to prove refinement between corresponding sub-components. A case study applying these two techniques is illustrated using Rodin, the Event-B toolset.","authors":["Renato Silva","Michael Butler"],"meta":["November 2010","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-25271-6_7","SourceDBLP","Conference: Formal Methods for Components and Objects - 9th International Symposium, FMCO 2010, Graz, Austria, November 29 - December 1, 2010.
