In general, this model consists of five basic phases: in a first phase collecting and preparing the data, so to make it in format suitable for the decision-making stage, this phase split into multi-steps (i.e., handle missing values and normalization dataset), and the second phase focuses on building constraints for each dataset and develops one of the optimization algorithms called cuckoo based on horizontal combination and multi-objective optimization used in third phase to generate the energy. Another model is developed as multi-layer neural network called (DCapsNet) based on linear combination and multi-objective functions used in the fourth phase to generate the energy. Final phase is related to evaluation of both models (DCOM and DCapsNet) to determine the best. The MORE-G is characterized by addressing one of the real problems, saving on material costs (i.e., reducing the need for manpower and reducing dependence on other countries in importing electric power) and upgrading the scope of the ministry of electricity.","authors":["Samaher Al-Janabi","Ayad F.
