{"id":"330302154_Exploiting_Moral_Values_to_Choose_the_Right_Norms","abstract":"Norms constitute regulative mechanisms extensively enacted in groups, organisations, and societies. However, 'choosing the right norms to establish' constitutes an open problem that requires the consideration of a number of constraints (such as norm relations) and preference criteria (e.g over involved moral values). This paper advances the state of the art in the Normative Multiagent Systems literature by formally defining this problem and by proposing its encoding as a linear program so that it can be automatically solved.","authors":["Marc Serramia","Maite López-Sánchez","Juan A.
