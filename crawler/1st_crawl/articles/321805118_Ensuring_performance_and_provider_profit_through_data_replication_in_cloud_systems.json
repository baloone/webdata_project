{"id":"321805118_Ensuring_performance_and_provider_profit_through_data_replication_in_cloud_systems","abstract":"Cloud computing is a relatively recent computing paradigm that is often the answer for dealing with large amounts of data. Tenants expect the cloud providers to keep supplying an agreed upon quality of service, while cloud providers aim to increase profits as it is a key ingredient of any economic enterprise. In this paper, we propose a data replication strategy for cloud systems that satisfies the response time objective for executing queries while simultaneously enables the provider to return a profit from each execution. The proposed strategy estimates the response time of the queries and performs data replication in a way that the execution of any particular query is still estimated to be profitable for the provider. We show with simulations that how the proposed strategy fulfills these two criteria.","authors":["Uras Tos","Riad Mokadem","Abdelkader Hameurlain","Tolga Ayav"],"meta":["September 2018Cluster Computing 21(4)","DOI:10.1007/s10586-017-1507-y"],"references":["318038195_Data_Replication_in_Cloud_Systems_A_Survey","283877306_Dynamic_replication_strategies_in_data_grid_systems_a_survey","312484084_A_Performance_and_Profit_Oriented_Data_Replication_Strategy_for_Cloud_Systems","308864116_Location-aware_data_replication_in_cloud_computing_systems","305463218_Pixida_Optimizing_data_parallel_jobs_in_wide-area_data_analytics","305449158_P2P_Data_Replication_Techniques_and_Applications","304412110_Dynamic_Data_Replication_Strategy_in_Cloud_Environments","293101685_RTRM_A_Response_Time-Based_Replica_Management_Strategy_for_Cloud_Storage_System","292671876_Pixida","291836080_Efficient_Data_Replication_Scheme_based_on_Hadoop_Distributed_File_System","281977265_Dynamic_Replication_and_Deployment_of_Services_in_Mobile_Environments","282740819_Data_Replication_Placement_Strategy_Based_On_Bidding_Mode_for_Cloud_Storage_Cluster","282500028_Ensuring_Cloud_Data_Reliability_with_Minimum_Replication_by_Proactive_Replica_Checking","278681135_P2P_Data_Replication_Techniques_and_Applications","266643166_A_Strategy_of_Dynamic_Replica_Creation_in_Cloud_Storage"]}
