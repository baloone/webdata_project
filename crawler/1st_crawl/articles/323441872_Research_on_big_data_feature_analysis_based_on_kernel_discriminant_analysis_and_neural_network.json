First of all, by introducing a kernel function for nonlinear projection, the training samples are mapped into a high dimensional subspace in order to get the best classification feature vector, which effectively solves the nonlinear problem and expands the differences between different types of samples. Then the optimized RBF neural network is used as classifier to complete the classification task. The node parameters are adjusted by using the negative gradient method and the linear least square method. The experimental results on the three types of databases show that the proposed algorithm has higher recognition rate than other algorithms with strong robustness.","authors":["Rui Zhang"],"meta":["February 2018Multimedia Tools and Applications 79(10)","DOI:10.1007/s11042-018-5733-y"],"references":["255976223_Discovering_Discriminative_Graphlets_for_Aerial_Image_Category_Recognition","228766738_Incremental_Linear_Discriminant_Analysis_Using_Sufficient_Spanning_Sets_and_Its_Applications","224134574_Sparse_Representation_for_Computer_Vision_and_Pattern_Recognition","220308054_Face_recognition_based_on_eigen_features_of_multi_scaled_face_components_and_artificial_neural_network","220183192_From_Few_to_Many_Illumination_Cone_Models_for_Face_Recognition_Under_Variable_Lighting_and_Pose","11550810_Prediction_of_central_nervous_system_embryonal_tumour_outcome_based_on_gene_expression","2314024_WebACE_A_Web_Agent_for_Document_Categorization_and_Exploration","320845226_Online_Modeling_of_Esthetic_Communities_Using_Deep_Perception_Graph_Analytics","316572727_Optimizing_Energy_Consumption_for_Big_Data_Collection_in_Large-Scale_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_With_Mobile_Collectors","309490313_Collaborative_Sparse_Coding_for_Multiview_Action_Recognition","305459294_SnapVideo_Personalized_Video_Generation_for_a_Sightseeing_Trip","291476014_Semantic_Photo_Retargeting_Under_Noisy_Image_Labels","287529357_Perception-Guided_Multimodal_Feature_Fusion_for_Photo_Aesthetics_Assessment","286175840_Face_recognition_based_on_null-space_kernel_discriminant_analysis","284570494_Image_Categorization_by_Learning_a_Propagated_Graphlet_Path","284432331_A_Revolution_That_Will_Transform_How_We_Live_Work_and_Think_An_Interview_with_the_Authors_of_Big_Data","284277293_Detecting_Densely_Distributed_Graph_Patterns_for_Fine-Grained_Image_Categorization","282482791_Fine-Grained_Image_Categorization_by_Localizing_TinyObject_Parts_from_Unannotated_Images","280094354_Biologically_Inspired_Media_Quality_Modeling","280059642_Weakly_Supervised_Human_Fixations_Prediction","273833766_Large-Scale_Aerial_Image_Categorization_Using_a_Multitask_Topological_Codebook","272083521_Incremental_Linear_Discriminant_Analysis_A_Fast_Algorithm_and_Comparisons","264578946_Weakly_Supervised_Photo_Cropping","264503092_A_Probabilistic_Associative_Model_for_Segmenting_Weakly_Supervised_Images","263480370_Big_data_A_survey","262305146_Data-intensive_applications_challenges_techniques_and_technologies_A_survey_on_Big_Data","262283039_Recognizing_architecture_styles_by_hierarchical_sparse_coding_of_blocklets","261605222_Actively_Learning_Human_Gaze_Shifting_Paths_for_Semantics-Aware_Photo_Cropping","261605083_Fusion_of_Multichannel_Local_and_Global_Structural_Cues_for_Photo_Aesthetics_Evaluation","261479306_Semi-supervised_Node_Splitting_for_Random_Forest_Construction","261236488_Probabilistic_Graphlet_Cut_Exploiting_Spatial_Structure_Cue_for_Weakly_Supervised_Image_Segmentation","260712606_Representative_Discovery_of_Structure_Cues_for_Weakly-Supervised_Image_Segmentation","258252899_Feature_Correlation_Hypergraph_Exploiting_High-order_Potentials_for_Multimodal_Recognition","257391649_Incremental_learning_of_complete_linear_discriminant_analysis_for_face_recognition","256994254_Fast_multi-view_segment_graph_kernel_for_object_classification","256720807_Feature_extraction_using_a_fast_null_space_based_linear_discriminant_analysis_algorithm","232256018_Probabilistic_Graphlet_Transfer_for_Photo_Cropping","224214006_Improvement_in_PCA_Performance_Using_FLD_and_RBF_Neural_Networks_for_Face_Recognition","221572456_Feature_selection_for_fast_speech_emotion_recognition","12292422_Generalized_Discriminant_Analysis_Using_a_Kernel_Approach"]}
