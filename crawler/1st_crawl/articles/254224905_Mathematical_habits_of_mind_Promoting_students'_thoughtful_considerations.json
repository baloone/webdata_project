{"id":"254224905_Mathematical_habits_of_mind_Promoting_students'_thoughtful_considerations","abstract":"Colleges in the US are being compelled to rethink what the First Year Experience or Seminar ought to be for students who have difficulty with mathematics, and what ought to be the mathematics education of teachers, K-12, given the minimal success most students are experiencing. It will be argued here that toward ensuring a more successful education for all students learning mathematics, and most especially for those who will become teachers, the inquiry process must be made explicit so that the productive practices of a mathematically-inclined mind are considered as content. That is to say, the classroom conversation needs to include discussion of the actions mathematically able thinkers use to gain insight into a problem; such as: considering a simpler problem, tinkering, taking things apart. This paper will make an argument why this is an essential consideration for promoting a robust society, and include instances of how mathematics may be presented in this framework.","authors":["Marshall Gordon"],"meta":["August 2011Curriculum Studies 43(4):1-13","DOI:10.1080/00220272.2011.578664"],"references":["233237362_Pressing_dilemmas_Meaning-making_and_justification_in_mathematics_teaching","50205817_Educational_dialogues_and_the_fostering_of_pupils'_independence_The_practices_of_two_teachers","324468677_On_Learning_Teaching_and_Learning_Teaching","275807382_On_Learning_Teaching_and_Learning_Teaching","274916166_Secondary_Mathematics_A_Functional_Approach_for_Teachers","266525757_Mathematical_discovery_On_understanding_learning_and_teaching_problem_solving_Vol_II","250184891_The_Preparation_of_Students_From_National_Science_Foundation-Funded_and_Commercially_Developed_High_School_Mathematics_Curricula_for_Their_First_University_Mathematics_Course","248986223_Unfulfilled_hopes_in_education_for_equity_Redesigning_the_mathematics_curriculum_in_a_US_high_school","246668669_Learning_mathematics_for_teaching_From_a_teachers'_seminar_to_the_classroom_Journal_of_Mathematics_Teacher_Education_11_55-87","235361985_The_Origins_of_Modern_Science_1300-1800","234586961_Habits_of_Mind_as_an_Organizer_for_the_Curriculum","230028261_Mathematical_Habits_of_the_Mind_for_Preservice_Teachers","200541425_How_to_Think_Like_a_Mathematician_A_Companion_to_Undergraduate_Mathematics"]}
