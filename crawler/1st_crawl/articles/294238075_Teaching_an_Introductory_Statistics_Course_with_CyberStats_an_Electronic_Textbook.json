{"id":"294238075_Teaching_an_Introductory_Statistics_Course_with_CyberStats_an_Electronic_Textbook","abstract":"In the Fall 2001 semester, we taught a \"Web-enhanced\" version of the undergraduate course \"Statistical Methods\" (STAT 2000) at Utah State University. The course used the electronic textbook CyberStats in addition to \"face-to-face\" teaching. This paper gives insight in our experiences in teaching this course. We describe the main features of CyberStats, the course content and the teaching techniques used in class, students' reactions and performance, and some specific problems encountered during the course. We compare this Web-enhanced course with other similar textbook-based courses and report instructors' and students' opinions. We finish with a general discussion of advantages and disadvantages of a Web-enhanced statistics course.
