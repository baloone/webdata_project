{"id":"312371989_Coils_slabs_and_molds_examining_community_affiliation_between_Late_Archaic_shell_ring_communities_using_radiographic_imagery_of_pottery","abstract":"Radiographic imaging is used to determine the techniques used to form vessels from two contemporaneous Late Archaic shell rings in coastal Georgia. These data, in concert with decorative and technofunctional data, suggest that different potting communities occupied each ring. The presence of different communities at each ring corresponds with larger regional patterns in which localized socio-political bodies developed during the Late Archaic. The findings offered in this paper suggest that localized groups did not exist in isolation but rather lived near one another for centuries.","authors":["Matthew Sanger"],"meta":["January 2017Southeastern Archaeology 36(2):1-15","DOI:10.1080/0734578X.2016.1267466","Project: Early Pottery in the New World"],"references":["325143696_Estimating_the_season_of_harvest_of_the_eastern_oyster_Crassostrea_virginica_from_the_St_Catherines_Shell_Ring","313283590_Evidence_for_Significant_Subterranean_Storage_at_Two_Hunter-Gatherer_Sites_The_presence_of_a_mast-based_economy_in_the_Late_Archaic_Coastal_American_Southeast","297928467_Adaptive_Cycles_of_Coastal_Hunter-Gatherers","349880980_Archaeology_of_Communities_A_New_World_Perspective","324376149_Stylistic_Variation_in_Prehistoric_Ceramics_Design_Analysis_in_the_American_Southwest","323321990_Imagined_communities_reflections_on_the_origin_and_spread_of_nationalism","313461841_Stallings_Island_Revisited_New_Evidence_for_Occupational_History_Community_Pattern_and_Subsistence_Technology","307632454_Xeroradiographic_Imaging","307629706_Investigating_pottery_vessel_manufacturing_techniques_using_radiographic_imaging_and_computed_tomography_Studies_from_the_Late_Archaic_American_Southeast","292682964_Themes_in_early_pottery_research"]}
