{"id":"220183413_NURBS_with_Extraordinary_Points_High-degree_Non-uniform_Rational_Subdivision_Schemes","abstract":"We present a subdivision framework that adds extraordinary vertices to NURBS of arbitrarily high degree. The surfaces can represent any odd degree NURBS patch exactly. Our rules handle non-uniform knot vectors, and are not restricted to midpoint knot insertion. In the absence of multiple knots at extraordinary points, the limit surfaces have bounded curvature.","authors":["Tom Cashman","Ursula H. Augsd√∂rfer","Neil Anthony Dodgson","Malcolm A.
