{"id":"285254994_Median_Graphs_Characterizations_Location_Theory_and_Related_Structures","abstract":"Median graphs are surveyed from the point of view of their characterizations, their role in location theory and their connection with median structures. The median structures we present include ternary algebras, betweenness, interval structures, semilattices, hypergraphs, join geometries and conflict models. In addition, some new characterizations of median graphs as meshed graphs are presented and a new characterization in terms of location is given.","authors":["Sandi Klav≈æar","Henry Martyn Mulder"],"meta":["January 1999","Project: Axiomatics of consensus"],"references":["297168820_Graphs_orientable_as_distributive_lattices","285379789_Convex-expansion_algorithms_for_recognizing_and_isometric_embedding_of_median_graphs","268825179_Median_lattices_and_convex_subalgebras","267069321_Graphic_algebras","267058482_Theory_of_Convex_Structures","266515369_Median_graphs","266214211_Dynamic_Search_in_Graphs","266019358_The_congruence_lattice_of_simple_ternary_algebras","256416813_Medians_in_median_graphs","256391598_Distance-preserving_subgraphs_of_hypercubes"]}
