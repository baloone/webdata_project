{"id":"264673812_k-Metric_Antidimension_a_Privacy_Measure_for_Social_Graphs","abstract":"Let $G = (V, E)$ be a simple connected graph and $S = \\{w_1, \\cdots, w_t\\}\n\\subseteq V$ an ordered subset of vertices. The metric representation of a\nvertex $u\\in V$ with respect to $S$ is the $t$-vector $r(u|S) = (d_G(u, w_1),\n\\cdots, d_G(u, w_t))$, where $d_G(u, v)$ represents the length of a shortest\n$u-v$ path in $G$. The set $S$ is called a resolving set for $G$ if $r(u|S) =\nr(v|S)$ implies $u = v$ for every $u, v \\in V$. The smallest cardinality of a\nresolving set is the metric dimension of $G$. In this article we propose, to\nthe best of our knowledge, a new problem in Graph Theory that resembles to the\naforementioned metric dimension problem. We call $S$ a $k$-antiresolving set if\n$k$ is the largest positive integer such that for every vertex $v \\in V-S$\nthere exist other $k-1$ different vertices $v_1, \\cdots, v_{k-1} \\in V-S$ with\n$r(v|S) = r(v_1|S) = \\cdots = r(v_{k-1}|S)$, \\emph{i.e.}, $v$ and $v_1, \\cdots,\nv_{k-1}$ have the same metric representation with respect to $S$. The\n$k$-metric antidimension of $G$ is the minimum cardinality among all the\n$k$-antiresolving sets for $G$.\nIn this article, we introduce a novel privacy measure, named $(k,\n\\ell)$-anonymity and based on the $k$-metric antidimension problem, aimed at\nevaluating the resistance of social graphs to active attacks. We, therefore,\npropose a true-biased algorithm for computing the $k$-metric antidimension of\nrandom graphs. The success rate of our algorithm, according to empirical\nresults, is above $80 \\%$ and $90 \\%$ when looking for a $k$-antiresolving\nbasis and a $k$-antiresolving set respectively. We also investigate theoretical\nproperties of the $k$-antiresolving sets and the $k$-metric antidimension of\ngraphs. In particular, we focus on paths, cycles, complete bipartite graphs and\ntrees.","authors":["Rolando Trujillo-Rasua","Ismael Gonzalez Yero"],"meta":["August 2015Information Sciences","DOI:10.1016/j.ins.2015.08.048","SourcearXiv","Project: Metric dimension of metric spaces and graphs"],"references":["260721001_A_Two-Stage_Deanonymization_Attack_against_Anonymized_Social_Networks","259528686_The_k-metric_dimension_of_a_graph_Complexity_and_algorithms","259445378_The_k-metric_dimension_of_a_graph","254008570_Canal_Scaling_Social_Network-Based_Sybil_Tolerance_Schemes","228641769_Base_size_metric_dimension_and_other_invariants_of_groups_and_graphs","224237573_Identity_obfuscation_in_graphs_through_the_information_theoretic_lens","221089948_Mistaking_friends_for_foes_an_analysis_of_a_social_network-based_Sybil_defense_in_mobile_networks","220875999_Analyzing_Privacy_in_Social_Networks--An_Interdisciplinary_Approach","220538635_K-Automorphism_A_General_Framework_For_Privacy_Preserving_Network_Publication","220538611_Resisting_structural_identification_in_anonymized_social_networks","220432950_Patterns_and_Dynamics_of_Users'_Behavior_and_Interaction_Network_Analysis_of_an_Online_Community","51963138_Reidentification_and_k-anonymity_A_model_for_disclosure_risk_in_graphs","47501550_On_the_metric_dimension_of_Grassmann_graphs","303151748_Leaves_of_trees","277490359_Measuring_the_impact_of_MVC_attack_in_large_complex_networks","264960330_On_the_metric_dimension_of_a_graph","233748480_On_the_metric_dimension_of_corona_product_graphs","226398643_A_Survey_of_Privacy-Preservation_of_Graphs_and_Social_Networks","225367840_On_Link_Privacy_in_Randomizing_Social_Networks","223217500_Landmarks_in_graphs","222514864_Resolvability_in_graphs_and_the_metric_dimension_of_a_graph","221653134_Comparisons_of_randomization_and_K-degree_anonymization_schemes_for_privacy_preserving_social_network_publishing","221613270_Fast_and_accurate_estimation_of_shortest_paths_in_large_graphs","221214038_Towards_Identity_Anonymization_on_Graphs","221023904_All_your_contacts_are_belong_to_us_Automated_identity_theft_attacks_on_social_networks","220906905_Randomizing_Social_Networks_a_Spectrum_Preserving_Approach","220894705_On_Link_Privacy_in_Randomizing_Social_Networks","220567573_Locating_and_total_dominating_sets_in_trees","220520113_A_Brief_Survey_on_Anonymization_Techniques_for_Privacy_Preserving_Publishing_of_Social_Network_Data","220473536_Resisting_Structural_Re-identification_in_Anonymized_Social_Networks","220429871_SybilLimit_A_Near-Optimal_Social_Network_Defense_Against_Sybil_Attacks","200110616_Wherefore_art_thou_r3579x_Anonymized_social_networks_hidden_patterns_and_structural_steganography","24165609_De-anonymizing_Social_Networks","4331054_Preserving_Privacy_in_Social_Networks_Against_Neighborhood_Attacks","2806775_Protecting_Privacy_when_Disclosing_Information_k-Anonymity_and_Its_Enforcement_through_Generalization_and_Suppression"]}
