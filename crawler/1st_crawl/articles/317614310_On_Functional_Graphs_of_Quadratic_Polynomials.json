{"id":"317614310_On_Functional_Graphs_of_Quadratic_Polynomials","abstract":"We study functional graphs generated by quadratic polynomials over prime fields. We introduce efficient algorithms for methodical computations and provide the values of various direct and cumulative statistical parameters of interest. These include: the number of connected functional graphs, the number of graphs having a maximal cycle, the number of cycles of fixed size, the number of components of fixed size, as well as the shape of trees extracted from functional graphs. We particularly focus on connected functional graphs, that is, the graphs which contain only one component (and thus only one cycle). Based on the results of our computations, we formulate several conjectures highlighting the similarities and differences between these functional graphs and random mappings.","authors":["Bernard Mans","Min Sha","Igor E.
