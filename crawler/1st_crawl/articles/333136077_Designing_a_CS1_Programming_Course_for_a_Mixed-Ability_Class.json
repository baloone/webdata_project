{"id":"333136077_Designing_a_CS1_Programming_Course_for_a_Mixed-Ability_Class","abstract":"First year programming-courses attract a diverse crowd of students. In the same course, we often get Computer Science (CS) and non-CS students who bring mixed-abilities and different learning needs to the classroom. Teaching the same material to all of these students present an interesting challenge to the instructor. This paper introduces a successful design of a CS1 programming course at the University of British Columbia - Okanagan. This design incorporated several teaching strategies, such as the partially-flipped classroom model and pair-programming, which were used to teach programming fundamentals by building animations and games using Processing, an open-source language that uses simplified Java syntax in a visually engaging environment. Initial results after applying the new design show improved class average grade, increased pass-rate, and higher student engagement and satisfaction.","authors":["Abdallah Mohamed"],"meta":["May 2019","DOI:10.1145/3314994.3325084","Conference: the Western Canadian Conference"],"references":["317420832_Improving_student_learning_in_an_introductory_programming_course_using_flipped_classroom_and_competency_framework","312056149_Flipped_Classroom_with_Problem_Based_Activities_Exploring_Self-regulated_Learning_in_a_Programming_Language_Course","304900887_The_Flipped_Classroom_Method_Lessons_Learned_from_Flipping_Two_Programming_Courses","285935974_The_flipped_classroom_A_survey_of_the_research","283096704_Flipped_Classroom_Strategies_for_CS_Education","262388928_Effect_of_think-pair-share_in_a_large_CS1_class_83_sustained_engagement","260979995_Success_in_Introductory_Programming_What_Works","228405788_Alice_A_3-D_tool_for_introductory_programming_concepts","227450483_Inverting_the_Classroom_A_Gateway_to_Creating_an_Inclusive_Learning_Environment","220808194_A_study_of_the_difficulties_of_novice_programmers","220613179_Failure_rates_in_introductory_programming","220422564_Pair_programming_improves_student_retention_confidence_and_program_quality","323323677_Designing_an_Introductory_Programming_Course_to_Improve_Non-Majors'_Experiences","312484686_An_Experience_Report_of_Flipped_Classroom_Strategy_Implementation_for_Java_Programming_Course","308863039_Flipping_a_programming_course_The_good_the_bad_and_the_ugly","308826330_Applying_flipped_classroom_and_problem-based_learning_in_a_CS1_course","300410674_The_Application_of_Hybrid_Flipped_Classroom_in_the_Course_of_Java_Programming","285340461_Think-pair-share_An_expanding_teaching_technique","225713922_Processing_Programming_for_the_media_arts","200085837_Learning_and_Teaching_Programming_A_Review_and_Discussion"]}
