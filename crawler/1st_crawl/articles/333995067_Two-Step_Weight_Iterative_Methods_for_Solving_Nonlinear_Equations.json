{"id":"333995067_Two-Step_Weight_Iterative_Methods_for_Solving_Nonlinear_Equations","abstract":"In this paper, a study on two-step weight iterative methods for solving nonlinear equations and also its cubic convergence. Nonlinear equation is the fundamentals inengineering, computer science and other many related fields. Many procedures have been developed during the past few decades. Yet there is need of procedures which is less time consuming in nature and more accurate when considering less iteration. We proposed a new method to give better result (minimum number of iterations) compared to other existing methods. Proposed method can be considered as a significant improvementof the Newton method and its variant forms.","authors":["K Gayathri","S Kamala","R A Myvizhi","J.
