{"id":"322937252_Inversion_of_Matrix_by_Elementary_Transformation_Representation_of_Numerical_Data_by_a_Polynomial_Curve","abstract":"Due to the necessity of a method in interpolation by approach which consists of the representation of numerical data by a polynomial and then to compute the value of the dependent variable from the polynomial corresponding to any given value of the independent variable, a method has been composed for representing a given set of numerical data on a pair of variables by a polynomial curve. The method has been developed with the help of inversion of matrix by Gauss Jordan method which is based on elementary row transformation. This paper describes the method developed with numerical example in order to show the application of the method to numerical data.","authors":["Dhritikesh Chakrabarty","Biswajit Das"],"meta":["December 2016","Project: Ph.D. Research"],"references":["323656612_Performance_Analysis_of_Transport_Control_Protocol_for_Cognitive_Radio_Ad_Hoc_Network","322959250_Matrix_Inversion_Representation_of_Numerical_Data_by_a_Polynomial_Curve","322937345_Confidence_Interval_of_Annual_Extremum_of_Ambient_Air_Temperature_at_Guwahati","322821318_Determination_of_Parameter_from_Observations_Composed_of_Itself_and_Errors","322821138_Natural_Interval_of_Monthly_Extreme_Temperature_in_the_Context_of_Assam","322797744_Newton's_Forward_Interpolation_Representation_of_Numerical_Data_by_a_Polynomial_Curve","322797649_Newton's_Backward_Interpolation_Representation_of_Numerical_Data_by_a_Polynomial_Curve","322797368_Central_Tendency_of_Annual_Extremum_of_Ambient_Air_Temperature_at_Guwahati","322797290_A_Method_of_Finding_True_Value_of_Parameter_from_Observation_Containing_Itself_and_Chance_Error","333315714_An_Energy_Efficient_and_Cooperative_Congestion_Control_Protocol_in_MANET"]}
