{"id":"334582054_A_Systems_Change_Approach_to_CS_Education_Creating_Rubrics_for_School_System_Implementation","abstract":"Computer science education is moving from an elective subject in K-12 schools to a more compulsory topic with a focus on all students. As a new discipline is added to education, we need to explore not only the implications and theory behind student and teacher learning and development, but also the systems change that will happen in organizations in order to produce sustainable CS education. In this paper, we explore theories of systems change, especially in education, and describe the creation of a series of rubrics to help districts self-assess their CS education supports. Early data is presented from a pilot year of workshops with 67 school districts showing a partial landscape of how school districts rate their own strengths and weaknesses and provide a discussion of initial evidence of validity for the rubrics.","authors":["Leigh Ann DeLyser","Lauren Wright"],"meta":["July 2019","DOI:10.1145/3304221.3319733","Conference: the 2019 ACM Conference"],"references":["336926752_Equity_in_the_Who_How_and_What_of_Computer_Science_Education_K12_School_District_Conceptualizations_of_Equity_in_'CS_for_All'_Initiatives","323324710_A_Landscape_Study_of_Computer_Science_Education_in_NYC_Early_Findings_and_Implications_for_Policy_and_Practice","318539160_Failure_The_Next_Generation_Why_Rigorous_Standards_are_not_Sufficient_to_Improve_Science_Learning","304346634_Landscape_of_K-12_Computer_Science_Education_in_the_US_Perceptions_Access_and_Barriers","303030478_Alignment_and_Accountability_in_Policy_Design_and_Implementation_The_Common_Core_State_Standards_and_Implementation_Research","265996870_Architectures_for_Learning_A_Comparative_Analysis_of_Two_Urban_School_Districts","258135728_Instructional_Program_Coherence_What_It_Is_and_Why_It_Should_Guide_School_Improvement_Policy","254090472_Stimulating_Reform_Race_to_the_Top_Competitive_Grants_and_the_Obama_Education_Agenda","242637290_Scoring_Rubric_Development_Validity_and_Reliability","236985839_The_Darmstadt_Model_A_First_Step_towards_a_Research_Framework_for_Computer_Science_Education_in_Schools_Keynote_Talk","234594682_School_Improvement_by_Design_Lessons_From_a_Study_of_Comprehensive_School_Reform_Programs","233869624_Computer_Science_Education_in_Secondary_Schools_--_The_Introduction_of_a_New_Compulsory_Subject","301705066_Bringing_computer_science_to_US_schools_state_by_state","300918435_Assessments_for_Computational_Thinking_in_K-12_Abstract_Only","286014975_Evidence_Interpretation_and_Persuasion_Instructional_Decision_Making_at_the_District_Central_Office","262244571_Measuring_demographics_and_performance_in_computer_science_education_at_a_nationwide_scale_using_AP_CS_data","254568020_Race_to_the_Top_The_Expanding_Role_of_US_State_Renewable_Portfolio_Standards","248906409_Leading_Data_Use_in_Schools_Organizational_Conditions_and_Practices_at_the_School_and_District_Levels","247928881_The_CS10K_project_mobilizing_the_community_to_transform_high_school_computing","241647110_Learning_From_Experience_Lessons_From_Policy_Implementation","241646757_Organizing_Research_and_Development_at_the_Intersection_of_Learning_Implementation_and_Design","221538457_Increasing_diversity_in_k-12_computer_science_strategies_from_the_field","40421656_Organizing_Schools_for_Improvement_Lessons_from_Chicago"]}
