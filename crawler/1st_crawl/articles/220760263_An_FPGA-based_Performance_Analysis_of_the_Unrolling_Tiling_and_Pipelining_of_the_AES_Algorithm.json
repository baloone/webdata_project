{"id":"220760263_An_FPGA-based_Performance_Analysis_of_the_Unrolling_Tiling_and_Pipelining_of_the_AES_Algorithm","abstract":"In October 2000 the National Institute of Standards and Technology chose Rijndael algorithm as the new Advanced Encryption\nStandard (AES). AES finds wide deployment in a huge variety of products making efficient implementations a significant priority.\nIn this paper we address the design and the FPGA implementation of a fully key agile AES encryption core with 128-bit keys.\nWe discuss the effectiveness of several design techniques, such as accurate floorplanning, the unrolling, tiling and pipelining\ntransformations (also in the case of feedback modes of operation) to explore the design space. Using these techniques, four\narchitectures with different level of parallelism, trading off area for performance, are described and their implementations\non a Virtex-E FPGA part are presented. The proposed implementations of AES achieve better performance as compared to other\nblocks in the literature and commercial IP core on the same device.","authors":["Gp Saggese","Antonino Mazzeo","Nicola Mazzocca","Antonio Strollo"],"meta":["September 2003Lecture Notes in Computer Science 2778:292-302","DOI:10.1007/978-3-540-45234-8_29","SourceDBLP","Conference: Field Programmable Logic and Application, 13th International Conference, FPL 2003, Lisbon, Portugal, September 1-3, 2003, Proceedings"],"references":["329322984_Handbook_of_Applied_Cryptography","242494127_Handbook_of_Applied_Cryptography","242468443_Optimizing_Synchronous_Circuitry_by_Retiming_Preliminary_Version","240026737_Handbook_of_Applied_CryptographyL_Chapter_6","239066494_Optimizing_synthesis_circuitry_by_retiming","225261309_Retiming_synchronous_circuitry","220760603_AES_implementation_on_FPGA_Time_flexibility_tradeoff","3954692_Unlocking_the_design_secrets_of_a_229_GBs_Rijndael_processor","3337199_An_FPGA-based_performance_evaluation_of_the_AES_block_cipher_candidate_algorithm_finalists","2526511_Unlocking_the_Design_Secrets_of_a_229_Gbs_Rijndael_Processor"]}
