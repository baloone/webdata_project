{"id":"320565068_The_Bishop_Frame_of_Bezier_Curves","abstract":"The purpose of this study is to discuss some differential geometric properties and Bishop frames of Bezier\ncurves. Firstly, we investigate Frenet frame and contact theory of Bezier curves. Furthermore, we have given some\nnecessary conditions and properties for the Bezier curve. Secondly we obtain the Bishop frame of Bezier curves in\nEuclidean 3-space.","authors":["Hatice Kusak"],"meta":["January 2015"],"references":["229076159_Parallel_Transport_Frame_in_4-dimensional_Euclidean_Space","210222830_There_is_More_than_One_Way_to_Frame_a_Curve","316167836_Timelike_Curves_of_Constant_Breadth_According_to_Bishop_Frame_in_Minkowski_3-Space","314731488_Curves_and_Surfaces_in_Computer_Aided_Geometric_Design","268627976_Some_characterizations_of_timelike_curves_according_to_Bishop_frame_in_Minkowski_3-space","266983450_Special_Bishop_Motion_and_Bishop_Darboux_Rotation_Axis_of_the_Space_Curve","242680402_The_Slant_Helices_According_to_Bishop_Frame","44444814_Bishop_Frame_of_The_Spacelike_Curve_with_a_Spacelike_Binormal_in_Minkowski_3-Space","30869776_Curves_and_Surfaces_in_Computer_Aided_Geometric_Design"]}
