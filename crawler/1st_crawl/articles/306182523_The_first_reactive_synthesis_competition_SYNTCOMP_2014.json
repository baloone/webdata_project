{"id":"306182523_The_first_reactive_synthesis_competition_SYNTCOMP_2014","abstract":"We introduce the reactive synthesis competition (SYNTCOMP), a long-term effort intended to stimulate and guide advances in the design and application of synthesis procedures for reactive systems. The first iteration of SYNTCOMP is based on the controller synthesis problem for finite-state systems and safety specifications. We provide an overview of this problem and existing approaches to solve it, and report on the design and results of the first SYNTCOMP. This includes the definition of the benchmark format, the collection of benchmarks, the rules of the competition, and the five synthesis tools that participated. We present and analyze the results of the competition and draw conclusions on the state of the art. Finally, we give an outlook on future directions of SYNTCOMP.","authors":["Swen Jacobs","Roderick Bloem","Romain Brenguier","RÃ¼diger Ehlers"],"meta":["June 2017International Journal on Software Tools for Technology Transfer 19(3):1-24","DOI:10.1007/s10009-016-0416-3"],"references":["310733101_A_High-Level_LTL_Synthesis_Format_TLSF_v11","309304669_Sylvan_multi-core_framework_for_decision_diagrams","279458507_The_first_reactive_synthesis_competition_SYNTCOMP_2014","304287260_Property-directed_synthesis_of_reactive_systems_from_safety_specifications","302204574_Solving_sequential_conditions_by_finite-state_operators","300541540_Benchmarking_and_Resource_Measurement","291437101_A_High-Level_LTL_Synthesis_Format_TLSF_v10","285344332_Symbolic_bounded_synthesis","283011106_Sylvan_Multi-Core_Decision_Diagrams","280765005_Graph-based_algorithms_for_Boolean_function_manipulation","268269353_Resolution-Based_Certificate_Extraction_for_QBF_Tool_Presentation","278822815_The_International_SAT_Solver_Competitions","273883744_Syntax-Guided_Synthesis","269311172_Partial_witnesses_from_preprocessed_quantified_Boolean_formulas","266443774_Decidability_of_second-order_theories_and_automata_on_infinite_trees"]}
