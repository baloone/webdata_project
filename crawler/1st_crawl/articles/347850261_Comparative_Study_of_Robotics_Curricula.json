{"id":"347850261_Comparative_Study_of_Robotics_Curricula","abstract":"Contribution: The information described in this study provides a starting point for discussing an effective robotics curriculum offered by any engineering university or institute. Background: Robotics is a multidisciplinary field that includes mechanical engineering, electrical and electronic engineering, and computer science. Several universities have established departments of robotics to teach their students robotics education; however, a comprehensive curriculum to deliver robotics education has not yet been fully developed. Research Questions: What are the significant component courses offered by existing departments of robotics? Methodology: This article investigates component courses among departments of robotics through a title-based aggregation of existing courses and textual analyses. Findings: From a title-based aggregation of robotics curricula from 19 departments established by 2018, control engineering, programming, technical drawing/design, and electronic engineering/electronic circuits were found to be the core courses. From textual analyses of the curricula, robotics departments' course titles were similar to those of mechanical engineering departments.","authors":["Mizuho Shibata","Kosei Demura","Shinichi Hirai","Akihiro Matsumoto"],"meta":["December 2020IEEE Transactions on Education PP(99):1-9","DOI:10.1109/TE.2020.3041667"],"references":["315066323_The_Effectiveness_of_Integrating_Educational_Robotic_Activities_into_Higher_Education_Computer_Science_Curricula_A_Case_Study_in_a_Developing_Country","282927812_Robotics_engineering_program_and_curriculum_development","258792932_A_One-Year_Introductory_Robotics_Curriculum_for_Computer_Science_Upperclassmen","224565399_A_10-Year_Mechatronics_Curriculum_Development_Initiative_Relevance_Content_and_Results-Part_II","317417939_Robotics_course_-_A_challenge_for_computer_science_students","303406320_Robotics_for_All_Ages_A_Standard_Robotics_Curriculum_for_K-16","280113623_The_Text_Mining_Handbook_Advanced_Approaches_in_Analyzing_Unstructured_Data","260587516_The_Robotic_Decathlon_Project-Based_Learning_Labs_and_Curriculum_Design_for_an_Introductory_Robotics_Course","260587289_Design-Oriented_Enhanced_Robotics_Curriculum","252191628_BigDog_the_Rough-Terrain_Quaduped_Robot"]}
