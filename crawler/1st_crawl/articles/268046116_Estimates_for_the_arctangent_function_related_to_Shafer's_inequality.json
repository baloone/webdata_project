{"id":"268046116_Estimates_for_the_arctangent_function_related_to_Shafer's_inequality","abstract":"The aim of this article is to give new refinements and sharpenings of Shaferâ€™s inequality involving the arctangent function. These are obtained by means of a change of variables, which makes the computations much easier than the classical approach.","authors":["Cristinel Mortici","Hari Mohan Srivastava"],"meta":["January 2014Colloquium Mathematicum 136(2)","DOI:10.4064/cm136-2-8"],"references":["266967032_On_Shafer-Fink_Inequalities","264993961_On_Shafer_and_Carlson_Inequalities","259568886_Sharpening_and_generalizations_of_Carlson's_double_inequality_for_the_arc_cosine_function","259568547_A_simple_proof_of_Oppenheim's_double_inequality_relating_to_the_cosine_and_sine_functions","259564466_Sharpening_and_generalizations_of_Shafer's_inequality_for_the_arc_sine_function","258241398_Sharpening_and_generalizations_of_Carlson's_double_inequality_for_the_arc_cosine_function","253183703_On_a_quadratic_estimate_of_Shafer","242076429_A_solution_of_a_problem_of_Oppeheim","283407877_Problems_and_solutions_Solutions_of_elementary_problems_E1867","237331040_An_application_of_l-method_on_inequalities_of_Shafer-Fink's_type","220483870_One_Method_for_Proving_Inequalities_by_Computer","26844189_Sharpening_and_Generalizations_of_Shafer's_Inequality_for_the_Arc_Tangent_Function","26487943_On_Shafer-Fink-Type_Inequality","24013373_Sharpening_and_generalizations_of_Shafer-Fink's_double_inequality_for_the_arc_sine_function","2130778_An_application_of_Lambda-method_on_inequalities_of_Shafer-Fink's_type"]}
