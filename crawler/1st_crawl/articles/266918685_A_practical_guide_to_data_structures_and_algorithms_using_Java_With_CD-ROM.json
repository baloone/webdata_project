{"id":"266918685_A_practical_guide_to_data_structures_and_algorithms_using_Java_With_CD-ROM","abstract":"Although traditional texts present isolated algorithms and data structures, they do not provide a unifying structure and offer little guidance on how to appropriately select among them. Furthermore, these texts furnish little, if any, source code and leave many of the more difficult aspects of the implementation as exercises. A fresh alternative to conventional data structures and algorithms books, A Practical Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms using Java presents comprehensive coverage of fundamental data structures and algorithms in a unifying framework with full implementation details. Recognizing that software development is a top-down process, this applications-centered book provides careful guidance to students and practitioners. Complete and thoroughly integrated Java implementations expose key differences among a wide range of important data structures, including many useful abstract data types not provided in standard Java libraries. Fundamental algorithms appear within the context of their supporting data structures. Case studies, examples, decision trees, and comparison charts throughout the stylized presentation illustrate and support an efficient methodology for the careful selection and application of data structures and algorithms. Appendices summarize major features of the Java programming language, introduce asymptotic notation and complexity analysis, and discuss design patterns applied in the book. A true marriage of theory and practice, this book sets a new standard as a comprehensive practical guide to data structures and algorithms. Practitioners and students will reach for this book often to quickly identify the best data structure or algorithm for their applications.","authors":["Sally. A Goldman","Kenneth.
