{"id":"224333033_The_Printed_Papers_of_Charles_Babbage","abstract":"This paper is intended to correct the list of printed papers of Charles Babbage (1791–1871) that Babbage printed in the back of his partial autobiography, Passages from the Life of a Philosopher (London, 1864). That list has been reprinted in several modern publications, but no attempt has been made to make it accurate or complete until this article. In an effort to make the list more useful to the reader, notes follow many of the items to explain their significance in Babbage’s life and work. No manuscript items are included; the paper deals only with Babbage’s list of printed works, as they existed at the time of his death.","authors":["Alfred W.
