{"id":"327707733_Fixed_Points_Results_in_Algebras_of_Split_Quaternion_and_Octonion","abstract":"Fixed points of functions have applications in game theory, mathematics, physics, economics and computer science. The purpose of this article is to compute fixed points of a general quadratic polynomial in finite algebras of split quaternion and octonion over prime fields Z p. Some characterizations of fixed points in terms of the coefficients of these polynomials are also given. Particularly, cardinalities of these fixed points have been determined depending upon the characteristics of the underlying field.","authors":["Mobeen Munir","Asim Naseem","Akhtar Rasool","Muhammad Shoaib Saleem"],"meta":["September 2018Symmetry 10(9):405","DOI:10.3390/sym10090405"],"references":["309391473_On_Elements_of_Split_Quaternions_over_Zp","306399993_Some_Fixed_Points_Results_of_Quadratic_Functions_in_Split_Quaternions","277723227_Geometrical_Applications_of_Split_Octonions","270515071_Cosmological_constant_supersymmetry_nonassociativity_and_Big_Numbers","268996159_Split_quaternion_matrices","260268966_An_octonionic_formulation_of_the_M-theory_algebra","260078691_Kaluza-Klein_theory_without_extra_dimensions_Curved_Clifford_space","269000300_Euler's_formula_and_De_Moivre's_formula_for_quaternions","267472302_On_the_structure_of_quaternion_rings_over_Z_p","261102858_A_fast_structure-preserving_method_for_computing_the_singular_value_decomposition_of_quaternion_matrices"]}
