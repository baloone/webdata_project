{"id":"279864580_Delay-Aware_Data_Transmission_of_Multi-carrier_Communications_in_the_Presence_of_Renewable_Energy","abstract":"In the paper, we investigate the delay-aware data transmission in renewable\nenergy aided multi-carrier system. Besides utilizing the local renewables, the\ntransmitter can also purchase grid power. By scheduling the amount of\ntransmitted data (The data are stored in a buffer before transmission), the\nsub-carrier allocation, and the renewable allocation in each transmission\nperiod, the transmitter aims to minimize the purchasing cost under a buffer\ndelay constraint. By theoretical analysis of the formulated stochastic\noptimization problem, we find that transmit the scheduled data through the\nsubcarrier with best condition is optimal and greedy renewable energy is\napproximately optimal. Furthermore, based on the theoretical derives and\nLyapunov optimization, an on-line algorithm, which does NOT require future\ninformation, is proposed. Numerical results illustrate the delay and cost\nperformance of the proposed algorithm. In addition, the comparisons with the\ndelay-optimal policy and cost-optimal policy are carried out.","authors":["Tian Zhang"],"meta":["October 2016Wireless Personal Communications 90(3)","DOI:10.1007/s11277-016-3408-4","SourcearXiv"],"references":["260670859_A_Survey_of_Energy-Efficient_Wireless_Communications","260521424_Reincarnation_in_the_Ambiance_Devices_and_Networks_with_Energy_Harvesting","233753065_A_Cross-Layer_Perspective_on_Energy-Harvesting-Aided_Green_Communications_Over_Fading_Channels","3080672_Communication_over_fading_channels_with_delay_constraints","271453796_Distributed_opportunistic_scheduling_for_wireless_networks_powered_by_renewable_energy_sources","260302482_Achieving_AWGN_Capacity_Under_Stochastic_Energy_Harvesting","45893828_Universal_Scheduling_for_Networks_with_Arbitrary_Traffic_Channels_and_Mobility","4361142_Power-Delay_Tradeoff_over_Wireless_Networks"]}
