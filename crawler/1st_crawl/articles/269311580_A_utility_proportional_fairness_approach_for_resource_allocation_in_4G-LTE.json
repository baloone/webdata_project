{"id":"269311580_A_utility_proportional_fairness_approach_for_resource_allocation_in_4G-LTE","abstract":"In this paper, we introduce an approach for resource allocation of elastic and inelastic adaptive real-time traffic in fourth generation long term evolution (4G-LTE) system. In our model, we use logarithmic and sigmoidal-like utility functions to represent the users applications running on different user equipments (UE)s. We present a resource allocation optimization problem with utility proportional fairness policy, where the fairness among users is in utility percentage (i.e user satisfaction with the service) of the corresponding applications. Our objective is to allocate the resources to the users with priority given to the adaptive real-time application users. In addition, a minimum resource allocation for users with elastic and inelastic traffic should be guaranteed. Our goal is that every user subscribing for the mobile service should have a minimum quality-of-service (QoS) with a priority criterion. We prove that our resource allocation optimization problem is convex and therefore the optimal solution is tractable. We present a distributed algorithm to allocate evolved NodeB (eNodeB) resources optimally with a priority criterion. Finally, we present simulation results for the performance of our rate allocation algorithm.","authors":["Ahmed Abdel-Hadi","Charles Clancy"],"meta":["February 2014","DOI:10.1109/ICCNC.2014.6785480","Conference: 2014 International Conference on Computing, Networking and Communications (ICNC)"],"references":["3335108_Downlink_Power_Allocation_for_Multi-Class_Wireless_Systems","261386431_Utility-proportional_fairness_in_wireless_networks","261127327_A_new_distributed_optimization_framework_for_hybrid_ad-hoc_networks","229058134_Convex_Optimization","221576742_Towards_a_fair_non-convex_resource_allocation_in_Wireless_Networks","220795169_Utility_Proportional_Fair_Bandwidth_Allocation_An_Optimization_Oriented_Approach","3334654_Optimization_Flow_Control-I_Basic_Algorithm_and_Convergence","3233587_Fundamental_design_issues_for_the_future_Internet","2638654_Achieving_MAC_Layer_Fairness_in_Wireless_Packet_Networks"]}
