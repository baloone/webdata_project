{"id":"300924415_SYMMETRIC_NONNEGATIVE_MATRICES","abstract":"This chapter discusses the symmetric nonnegative matrices. The problem of obtaining sufficient conditions for a set of complex numbers to be the spectrum of a nonnegative matrix appears to be a difficult one. The chapter presents sufficient conditions for a set of real numbers to be the spectrum of a nonnegative matrix, in fact, of a symmetric one. A cycle is a chain from a vertex to itself, such that no edge appears twice in the sequence. If V denotes the set of vertices of G and if A is a subset of V, then the graph with A as its vertex set and with all the edges in G that have their endpoints in A is called a subgraph of G. A connected graph is a graph that contains a chain from x to y for each pair x and y of distinct vertices. The relation, x = y or there exists a chain in G from x to y, is an equivalence relation on V. The classes of this equivalence relation partition V into connected subgraphs called the connected components of G. A tree is a connected graph without cycles.","authors":["ABRAHAM BERMAN","Robert J.
