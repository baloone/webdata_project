{"id":"234113787_Ultimate_Periodicity_of_b-Recognisable_Sets_A_Quasilinear_Procedure","abstract":"It is decidable if a set of numbers, whose representation in a base b is a\nregular language, is ultimately periodic. This was established by Honkala in\n1986.\nWe give here a structural description of minimal automata that accept an\nultimately periodic set of numbers. We then show that it can verified in linear\ntime if a given minimal automaton meets this description.\nThis thus yields a O(n log(n)) procedure for deciding whether a general\ndeterministic automaton accepts an ultimately periodic set of numbers.","authors":["Victor Marsault","Jacques Sakarovitch"],"meta":["January 2013","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-38771-5_32","SourcearXiv","Conference: International Conference on Developments in Language Theory","Project: Sets of numbers realised by automata"],"references":["227310237_Numeration_Systems_on_a_Regular_Language","287236948_Elements_of_Automata_Theory","268634473_Number_representation_and_finite_automata","267107635_Correction_to_Logic_and_p-recognizable_sets_of_integers","247442902_Introduction_To_Algorithms","247234737_Presburgerness_of_predicates_regular_in_two_number_systems","245841714_De_nable_criterion_for_de_nability_in_Presburger_Arithmetic_and_its_application","239552055_A_Polynomial_Time_Presburger_Criterion_and_Synthesis_for_Number_Decision_Diagrams_technical_report_1251","222562576_Abstract_numeration_systems","222551535_Description_and_analysis_of_a_bottom-up_DFA_minimization_algorithm"]}
