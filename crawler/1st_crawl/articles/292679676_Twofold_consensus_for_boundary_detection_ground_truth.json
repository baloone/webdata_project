{"id":"292679676_Twofold_consensus_for_boundary_detection_ground_truth","abstract":"In the evaluation of boundary detection methods it is common to use as ground truth a set of boundary images that are hand-made by human experts. This work proposes a novel representation of this ground truth. More specifically, we propose to combine the hand-made boundary images into a set-based consensus, which is constructed from the concordances and discordances among the images. We study the theoretical and visual properties of this consensus and present an application to quality evaluation.","authors":["C.
