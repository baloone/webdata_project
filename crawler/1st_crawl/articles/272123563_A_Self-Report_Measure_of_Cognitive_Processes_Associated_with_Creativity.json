{"id":"272123563_A_Self-Report_Measure_of_Cognitive_Processes_Associated_with_Creativity","abstract":"This study sought to explore creative cognitive processes and the similarities and differences in how descriptions of these processes group together in various self-report subscales. Based on empirical evidence from numerous studies involving the cognitive components of creativity training, the Cognitive Processes Associated with Creativity (CPAC) scale was developed to efficiently and directly address the processes of brainstorming, metaphorical and analogical thinking, perspective-taking, imagery, incubation, and flow. An online administered pilot study (n=226) and laboratory follow-up study (n=120) collected responses to the newly created CPAC scale and a variety of other creativity measures. Overall, the results provide preliminary evidence for the psychometric qualities of the CPAC scale. Specifically, the data from both studies support the construct validity and divergent validity, with mixed evidence for concurrent validity.","authors":["Angie L.
