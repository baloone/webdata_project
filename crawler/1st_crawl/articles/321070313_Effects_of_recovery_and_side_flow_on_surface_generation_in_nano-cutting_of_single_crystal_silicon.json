{"id":"321070313_Effects_of_recovery_and_side_flow_on_surface_generation_in_nano-cutting_of_single_crystal_silicon","abstract":"The effects of the recovery and side flow on the surface generation, as well as the stagnation region, phase transformation in nano-cutting of single crystal silicon are investigated by means of molecular dynamics. In this study, the workpiece material would experience two cutting processes in the conditions where the recovery and subsurface damage of the former cutting trace could be and not be taken into consideration. Therefore, the combined effects of the side flow and recovery on the surface generation are decoupled and investigated respectively. The results show that the side flow of the material increases the generated surface roughness making it deviate from the theoretical value. The recovery left on the former cutting trace enlarges the size of side flow and further increases the surface roughness indirectly. But the overall surface roughness is decreased by the effect of recovery. Comparing the effects of the side flow and the recovery on the generated surface roughness, the side flow plays a more important role in surface generation of nano-cutting process. Therefore, the suppression of the side flow is an effective way to improve the generated surface roughness in nano-cutting. The phase of single crystal silicon in machined subsurface is transformed to amorphous and bct5-Si phases. A larger stagnation height would make more materials phase transformed.","authors":["Feifei Xu","Fengzhou Fang","Xiaodong Zhang"],"meta":["February 2018Computational Materials Science 143:133-142","DOI:10.1016/j.commatsci.2017.11.002"],"references":["317389498_Side_Flow_Effect_on_Surface_Generation_in_Nano_Cutting","316490037_Crystal_Orientation_Effect_on_the_Subsurface_Deformation_of_Monocrystalline_Germanium_in_Nanometric_Cutting","316345598_Study_on_Crystallographic_Orientation_Effect_on_Surface_Generation_of_Aluminum_in_Nano-cutting","312960330_Effect_of_cutting_edge_radius_on_surface_roughness_and_tool_wear_in_hard_turning_of_AISI_52100_steel","312338303_Nanometric_Cutting_of_Silicon_with_an_Amorphous-Crystalline_Layered_Structure_A_Molecular_Dynamics_Study","312337354_A_study_on_the_tool_edge_geometry_effect_on_nano-cutting","318454869_Hard_particle_effect_on_surface_generation_in_nano-cutting","313682634_Fundamental_investigation_on_partially_overlapped_nano-cutting_of_monocrystalline_germanium","313478303_Interaction_between_phase_transformations_and_dislocations_at_incipient_plasticity_of_monocrystalline_silicon_under_nanoindentation","303689902_Effect_of_cutting_edge_radius_on_surface_roughness_in_diamond_tool_turning_of_transparent_MgAl2O4_spinel_ceramic"]}
