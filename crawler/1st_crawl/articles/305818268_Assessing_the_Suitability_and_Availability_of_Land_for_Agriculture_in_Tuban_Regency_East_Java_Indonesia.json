{"id":"305818268_Assessing_the_Suitability_and_Availability_of_Land_for_Agriculture_in_Tuban_Regency_East_Java_Indonesia","abstract":"Indonesian food production depends highly on Java Island, which holds the most fertile soils in the country but had limited area. The objective of the research was to analyse the availability of suitable land for agriculture in Tuban Regency, an agricultural regency in Java Island. Land suitability was evaluated with spatial multicriteria analysis, integrating soil order, land capability, elevation, slope, slope direction, land use/land cover, accessibility, and climate. Land availability was analysed, integrating the forest area status designation and the spatial pattern of regional official land use plan. The results indicated that suitable land for agriculture corresponds to 91% of the total study area, confirming the high soil fertility. Analysis of land availability then indicated that 18% of the area was both suitable and available for agriculture. Considering the actual land utilization, the future development of agriculture in the region has less than 7% of the land area left for agricultural expansion. The overall results showed the importance of looking for land allocated for agriculture outside Java Island to anticipate the need for food of a country with a high population growth rate and also developing planning for food production.","authors":["Widiatmaka Widiatmaka","Wiwin Ambarwulan","Yudi Setiawan","Christian Walter"],"meta":["January 2016Applied and Environmental Soil Science 2016(2):1-13","DOI:10.1155/2016/7302148"],"references":["310763391_Land_Use_Planning_for_Brackish_Water_Shrimp_Ponds_in_The_North_Coast_of_Tuban_Indonesia","301668465_Spatial_multi-criteria_decision_making_for_delineating_agricultural_land_in_Jakarta_metropolitan_area's_hinterland_Case_study_of_Bogor_regency_West_Java","295253515_Land_Use_Planning_for_Brackish_Water_Shrimp_Ponds_in_The_North_Coast_of_Tuban_Indonesia","284844356_Agricultural_Land_Utilization_Efficiency_The_Case_of_Latvia","283521631_Suitable_and_available_land_for_cashew_Anacardium_occidentale_L_in_the_island_of_Lombok_Indonesia","281675941_Land_Capability_Based_Environmental_Carrying_Capacity_in_Tuban_East_Java","281653012_Establishing_Land_Suitability_Criteria_for_Cashew_Anacardium_occidentale_L_in_Indonesia","276514507_Land_suitability_and_dynamic_system_modelling_to_define_priority_areas_of_soybean_plantation_in_paddy_fields_in_Karawang_West_Java","274898621_Better_land-use_allocation_outperforms_land_sparing_and_land_sharing_approaches_to_conservation_in_Central_Kalimantan_Indonesia","255721264_Agricultural_land_use_suitability_analysis_using_GIS_and_AHP_technique"]}
