{"id":"332910149_A_Survey_On_Honeypots_Honeynets_And_Their_Applications_On_Smart_Grid","abstract":"Power grid is a major part of modern Critical Infrastructure (CIN). The rapid evolution of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) enables traditional power grids to encompass advanced technologies that allow them to monitor their state, increase their reliability, save costs and provide ICT services to end customers, thus converting them into smart grids. However, smart grid is exposed to several security threats, as hackers might try to exploit vulnerabilities of the industrial infrastructure and cause disruption to national electricity\nsystem with severe consequences to citizens and commerce. This\npaper investigates and compares honey-x technologies that could\nbe applied to smart grid in order to distract intruders, obtain attack strategies, protect the real infrastructure and form forensic evidence to be used in court.","authors":["Christos Dalamagkas","Panagiotis G.
