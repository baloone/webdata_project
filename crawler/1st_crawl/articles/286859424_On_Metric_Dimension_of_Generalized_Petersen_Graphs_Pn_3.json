{"id":"286859424_On_Metric_Dimension_of_Generalized_Petersen_Graphs_Pn_3","abstract":"In this paper we study the metric dimension of the generalized Petersen graphs P(n, 3) by giving a partial answer to an open problem raised in [8]: Is P(n,3) for n > 7 and 3 < m < L[n-1/2], a family of graphs with constant metric dimension? We prove that the generalized Petersen graphs P(n, 3) have metric dimension equal to 3 for n = 1(mod 6), n > 25, and to 4 for n = 0(mod 6), n > 24. For the remaining cases only 4 vertices appropriately chosen suffice to resolve all the vertices of P(n,3), thus implying that dim(P(n, 3)) < 4, except when n = 2(mod 6), when dim(P(n, 3)) < 5.","authors":["Muhammad Imran","A.
