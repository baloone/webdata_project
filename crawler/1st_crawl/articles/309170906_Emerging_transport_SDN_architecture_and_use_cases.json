{"id":"309170906_Emerging_transport_SDN_architecture_and_use_cases","abstract":"SDN and virtualization promise to simplify transport network control, while adding management flexibility and allowing the rapid development of new services by enabling programmatic control of transport networks and equipment. A consensus transport SDN (T-SDN) architecture using standards- based system inter-component interfaces further enables flexible composition of functionally unified systems from among vendor-diverse software and hardware components. In this article we discuss the high-level reference T-SDN architecture emerging from early experience, standards, and related industry activities, with attention paid to critical standards-based system interface methodologies. We examine key T-SDN use cases including service bandwidth on demand, virtual transport network services, and multi-layer control convergence and resource optimization.","authors":["Christopher Janz","Lyndon Ong","Karthik Sethuraman","Vishnu Shukla"],"meta":["October 2016IEEE Communications Magazine 54(10):116-121","DOI:10.1109/MCOM.2016.7588279"],"references":[]}
