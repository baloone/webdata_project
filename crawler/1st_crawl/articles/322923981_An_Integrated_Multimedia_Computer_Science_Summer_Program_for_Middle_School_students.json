{"id":"322923981_An_Integrated_Multimedia_Computer_Science_Summer_Program_for_Middle_School_students","abstract":"Computers and technology are becoming an ever more essential component in business and human life. It is very important to incorporate modern technology and computer science knowledge into science curriculum in middle school to increase the desire from students in this area to learn more about computers. We proposed a multimedia summer program for promoting computer science education in middle school. The program was successfully run at Freehold Borough School District in New Jersey from 8 am to 12 pm, four days per week for 3 weeks, from 7/6 to 7/23, 2015. Topics covered, such as website creation, media editing, and Microsoft Excel Macro, enticed the students to establish new skills, allowing further growth and interest in the field. With this program, we hope to foster a desire from the students to head out to college interested in computer and technology majors, and pursue related careers.","authors":["Ching-Yu Huang","Richard Olszewski","Rocco Tomazic"],"meta":["July 2016","Conference: The 12th International Conference on Frontiers in Education: Computer Science and Computer Engineering (FECS'16)At: Las Vegas, NV"],"references":["322923983_Pathway_from_Learning_Multimedia_Software_to_Computer_Science_Education","261196400_Implementing_a_new_Computer_Science_Curriculum_for_middle_school_in_Israel","262351376_Influencing_middle_school_girls_to_study_computer_science_through_educational_computer_games","262347560_CE21--Maryland_the_state_of_computer_science_education_in_Maryland_high_schools","262293784_CS_principles_goes_to_middle_school_Learning_how_to_teach_Big_Data","228352098_A_Model_Curriculum_for_K-12_Computer_Science_Level_I_Objectives_and_Outlines"]}
