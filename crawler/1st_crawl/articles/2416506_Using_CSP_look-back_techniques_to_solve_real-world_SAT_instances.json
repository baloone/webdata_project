{"id":"2416506_Using_CSP_look-back_techniques_to_solve_real-world_SAT_instances","abstract":"We report on the performance of an enhanced version of the \"Davis-Putnam\" (DP) proof procedure for propositional satisfiability (SAT) on large instances derived from realworld problems in planning, scheduling, and circuit diagnosis and synthesis. Our results show that incorporating CSP lookback techniques -- especially the relatively new technique of relevance-bounded learning -- renders easy many problems which otherwise are beyond DP's reach. Frequently they make DP, a systematic algorithm, perform as well or better than stochastic SAT algorithms such as GSAT or WSAT. We recommend that such techniques be included as options in implementations of DP, just as they are in systematic algorithms for the more general constraint satisfaction problem. Introduction While CNF propositional satisfiability (SAT) is a specific kind constraint satisfaction problem (CSP), until recently there has been little application of popular CSP look-back techniques in SAT algorithms.
