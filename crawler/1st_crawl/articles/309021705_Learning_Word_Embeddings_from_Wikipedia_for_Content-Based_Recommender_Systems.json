{"id":"309021705_Learning_Word_Embeddings_from_Wikipedia_for_Content-Based_Recommender_Systems","abstract":"In this paper we present a preliminary investigation towards the adoption of Word Embedding techniques in a content-based recommendation scenario. Specifically, we compared the effectiveness of three widespread approaches as Latent Semantic Indexing, Random Indexing and Word2Vec in the task of learning a vector space representation of both items to be recommended as well as user profiles.\nTo this aim, we developed a content-based recommendation (CBRS) framework which uses textual features extracted from Wikipedia to learn user profiles based on such Word Embeddings, and we evaluated this framework against two state-of-the-art datasets. The experimental results provided interesting insights, since our CBRS based on Word Embeddings showed results comparable to those of well-performing algorithms based on Collaborative Filtering and Matrix Factorization, especially in high-sparsity recommendation scenarios.","authors":["Cataldo Musto","Giovanni Semeraro","Marco de Gemmis","Pasquale Lops"],"meta":["March 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-30671-1_60","Conference: European Conference on Information Retrieval"],"references":["266747839_BilBOWA_Fast_Bilingual_Distributed_Representations_without_Word_Alignments","257882504_Distributed_Representations_of_Words_and_Phrases_and_their_Compositionality","225237559_Random_Indexing_and_Negative_User_Preferences_for_Enhancing_Content-Based_Recommender_Systems","221553209_Recommending_Library_Methods_An_Evaluation_of_the_Vector_Space_Model_VSM_and_Latent_Semantic_Indexing_LSI","307955489_Distributed_representations_of_words_and_phrases_and_their_compositionality","303802749_Indexing_by_Latent_Semantic_Analysis","300572451_Combining_Distributional_Semantics_and_Entity_Linking_for_Context-Aware_Content-Based_Recommendation","270877509_Learning_Sentiment-Specific_Word_Embedding_for_Twitter_Sentiment_Classification","228057706_Indexing_By_Latent_Semantic_Analysis","215992160_An_Introduction_to_Random_Indexing"]}
