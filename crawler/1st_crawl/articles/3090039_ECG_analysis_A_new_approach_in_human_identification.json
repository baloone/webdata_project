{"id":"3090039_ECG_analysis_A_new_approach_in_human_identification","abstract":"A new approach in human identification is investigated. For this\npurpose, a standard 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) recorded during rest\nis used. Selected features extracted from the ECG are used to identify a\nperson in a predetermined group. Multivariate analysis is used for the\nidentification task. Experiments show that it is possible to identify a\nperson by features extracted from one lead only. Hence, only three\nelectrodes have to be attached on the person to be identified. This\nmakes the method applicable without too much effort","authors":["Lena Biel","Ola Pettersson","Lennart Philipson","Peter Wide"],"meta":["July 2001IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement 50(3):808 - 812","DOI:10.1109/19.930458","SourceIEEE Xplore"],"references":["297509531_Evaluating_security_of_a_simple_interactive_human_identification_scheme","274202844_Neural_Networks_for_Pattern_Recognition","270545552_Medical_Instrumentation-Application_and_Design","246909684_Multivariate_Analysis_-_In_Practice","232179040_Clinical_Electrocardiography_A_Simplified_Approach","223661563_A_security_system_based_on_human_iris_identification_using_wavelet_transform","223009662_Automatic_recognition_and_analysis_of_human_faces_and_facial_expressions_A_survey","221017930_A_security_system_based_on_human_iris_identification_using_wavelet_transform","215721451_Neural_Networks_For_Pattern_Recognition","21685752_Computerized_Electrocardiogram_Diagnosis_Fuzzy_Approach"]}
