{"id":"316501447_Highly_Unique_Network_Descriptors_Based_on_the_Roots_of_the_Permanental_Polynomial","abstract":"In this paper, we examine the zeros of permanental polynomials as highly unique network descriptors. We employ exhaustively generated networks and demonstrate that our defined graph measures based on the moduli of the zeros of permanental polynomials are quite efficient when distinguishing graphs structurally. In this work, we continue with a line of research that relates to the search of almost complete graph invariants. These highly unique network measures may serve as a powerful tool for tackling graph isomorphism.","authors":["Matthias Dehmer","Frank Emmert-Streib","Bo Hu","Yongtang Shi"],"meta":["April 2017Information Sciences 408:176-181","DOI:10.1016/j.ins.2017.04.041"],"references":["263899094_Structural_Differentiation_of_Graphs_Using_Hosoya-Based_Indices","261400333_Interrelations_of_Graph_Distance_Measures_Based_on_Topological_Indices","257508054_An_efficient_heuristic_approach_to_detecting_graph_isomorphism_based_on_combinations_of_highly_discriminating_invariants","256091457_Permanental_Polynomials_of_the_Larger_Fullerenes","238692599_A_Class_of_Globally_Convergent_Iteration_Functions_for_the_Solution_of_Polynomial_Equations","234193216_Information_Theory_Distance_Matrix_and_Molecular_Branching","230872638_Solutions_of_Vandermonde_Systems_of_Equations","221890920_Information_Indices_with_High_Discriminative_Power_for_Graphs","220524261_The_Discrimination_Ability_of_Some_Topological_and_Information_Distance_Indices_for_Graphs_of_Unbranched_Hexagonal_Systems","293015486_Fifty_Years_of_Graph_Matching_Network_Alignment_and_Network_Comparison","284478067_Practical_Graph_Isomorphism","281653440_Encoding_structural_information_uniquely_with_polynomial-based_descriptors_by_employing_the_Randic_matrix","266979210_The_permanental_polynomials_of_certain_graphs","266188405_The_Structure_and_Dynamics_of_Networks","265775368_The_global_graph_as_a_complete_topological_invariant_in_the_class_of_diffeomorphisms_on_M3","265456735_Solution_of_Vandermonde_Systems_of_Equations","265373645_The_Lapacian_permanental_polynomial_Formulas_and_algorithms","264955302_Spectra_of_Graphs_Theory_and_Application","264443401_ChemInform_Abstract_Vertex-_and_Edge-Weighted_Molecular_Graphs_and_Derived_Structural_Descriptors","263688077_Characterizing_properties_of_permanental_polynomials_of_lollipop_graphs","260954031_Uniquely_Discriminating_Molecular_Structures_Using_Novel_Eigenvalue-Based_Descriptors","256805376_On_the_characterizing_properties_of_the_permanental_polynomials_of_graphs","253870847_Highly_Discriminating_Distance-Based_Topological_Index","239345686_A_Simple_Proof_of_the_Leverrier-Faddeev_characteristic_polynomial_algorithm","233177874_Permanents_of_Adjacency_Matrices_and_Their_Dependence_on_Molecular_Structure","229650449_The_Graph_Isomorphism_Problem","222958722_Permanental_polynomials_of_graphs","220257252_An_efficient_algorithm_for_computing_permanental_polynomials_of_graphs","12278312_Permanental_Polynomials_of_the_Smaller_Fullerenes","11083171_A_Differential-Operator_Approach_to_the_Permanental_Polynomial","8996425_Immanants_and_Immanantal_Polynomials_of_Chemical_Graphs","7060226_Newman_MEJ_Modularity_and_community_structure_in_networks_Proc_Natl_Acad_Sci_USA_103_8577-8582"]}
