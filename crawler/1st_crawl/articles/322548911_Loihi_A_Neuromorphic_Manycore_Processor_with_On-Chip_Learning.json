{"id":"322548911_Loihi_A_Neuromorphic_Manycore_Processor_with_On-Chip_Learning","abstract":"Loihi is a 60 mm2 chip fabricated in Intels 14nm process that advances the state-of-the-art modeling of spiking neural networks in silicon. It integrates a wide range of novel features for the field, such as hierarchical connectivity, dendritic compartments, synaptic delays, and most importantly programmable synaptic learning rules. Running a spiking convolutional form of the Locally Competitive Algorithm, Loihi can solve LASSO optimization problems with over three orders of magnitude superior energy-delay-product compared to conventional solvers running on a CPU iso-process/voltage/area. This provides an unambiguous example of spike-based computation outperforming all known conventional solutions.","authors":["Mike Davies","Narayan Srinivasa","Tsung-Han Lin","Gautham Chinya"],"meta":["January 2018IEEE Micro PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/MM.2018.112130359","Projects: Neuromorphic computingLoihi neuromorphic processor with on-chip learning"],"references":["311715005_Event-Driven_Random_Back-Propagation_Enabling_Neuromorphic_Deep_Learning_Machines","276158066_A_Re-configurable_On-line_Learning_Spiking_Neuromorphic_Processor_comprising_256_neurons_and_128K_synapses","260869696_Supervised_learning_in_spiking_neural_networks_with_ReSuMe_sequence_learning_classification_and_spike_shifting","251570181_Rapid_parallel_path_planning_by_propagating_wavefronts_of_spiking_neural_activity","220910433_A_45nm_CMOS_neuromorphic_chip_with_a_scalable_architecture_for_learning_in_networks_of_spiking_neurons","51808530_Neural_Dynamics_as_Sampling_A_Model_for_Stochastic_Computation_in_Recurrent_Networks_of_Spiking_Neurons","317062261_Local_Information_with_Feedback_Perturbation_Suffices_for_Dictionary_Learning_in_Neural_Circuits","264630187_ARTIFICIAL_BRAINS_A_million_spiking-neuron_integrated_circuit_with_a_scalable_communication_network_and_interface","262786959_Optimal_sparse_approximation_with_integrate_and_fire_neurons","220124383_A_Fast_Iterative_Shrinkage-Thresholding_Algorithm_for_Linear_Inverse_Problems"]}
