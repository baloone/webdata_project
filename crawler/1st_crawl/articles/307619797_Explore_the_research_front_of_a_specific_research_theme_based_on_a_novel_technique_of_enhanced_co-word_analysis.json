{"id":"307619797_Explore_the_research_front_of_a_specific_research_theme_based_on_a_novel_technique_of_enhanced_co-word_analysis","abstract":"Discovering the research front of a specific topic remains a significant challenge for researchers in all scientific areas. Over the last decade, burst term detection (BTD) in text streams has become a useful technique for bibliometrics and science mapping. It has been argued that analytical methods based on BTD can indicate certain facets of a research front. To integrate BTD into the framework of traditional co-word analysis, association rule mining between keywords and burst terms (ARM-KB) is introduced to enhance traditional co-word analysis and present a new facet of the research front for a field of science. Based on ARM-KB, possible connections between keywords and burst terms are built, which can facilitate the exploration of a research front from a three-dimensional perspective, through co-word analysis, burst term clues, and association rules. In the case study, the research fronts of anticancer based on nanomedicine (ABN) are explored. Based on theoretical and empirical analyses, ARM-KB can be used as a valuable new technique or a supplement to traditional bibliometrics in the exploration of scientific frontiers.","authors":["Munan Li","Yanqun Chu"],"meta":["September 2016Journal of Information Science 43(6)","DOI:10.1177/0165551516661914"],"references":["307174918_Mining_association_rules_between_sets_of_items_in_large_databases","281549793_The_Dynamic_evolution_of_core_documents_an_experimental_study_based_on_h-related_literature_2005-2013","280238407_A_systematic_method_to_create_search_strategies_for_emerging_technologies_based_on_the_Web_of_Science_Illustrated_for_Big_Data","277501597_Automated_support_specification_for_efficient_mining_of_interesting_association_rules","313606501_Mining_Association_rules_between_sets_of_items_in_large_databases","282563656_Burst_Analysis_for_Automatic_Concept_Map_Creation_with_a_Single_Document","281521016_Targeted_Doxorubicin_Nanotherapy_Strongly_Suppressing_Growth_of_Multidrug_Resistant_Tumor_in_Mice","281484235_Tumortropic_monocyte-mediated_delivery_of_echogenic_polymer_bubbles_and_therapeutic_vesicles_for_chemotherapy_of_tumor_hypoxia","275444277_Topic_evolution_based_on_LDA_and_HMM_and_its_application_in_stem_cell_research","275444072_Intellectual_structure_of_the_institutional_repository_field_A_co-word_analysis"]}
