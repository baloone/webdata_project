{"id":"309056693_Japanese_term_extraction_using_dictionary_hierarchy_and_machine_translation_system","abstract":"There have been many studies of automatic term recognition (ATR) and they have achieved good results. However, they focus on a mono-lingual term extraction method. Therefore, it is difficult to extract terms from documents in foreign languages. This article describes an automatic term extraction method from documents in foreign languages using a machine translation system. In our method, we translate documents in foreign languages into documents in Korean and extract terms in the translated Korean documents. Finally the terms recognized from the Korean documents are translated into terms in the foreign language. By using our method, one can extract terms for languages, which one does not know.","authors":["Jong-Hoon Oh","J. Lee","K.-S. Lee","K.-S.
