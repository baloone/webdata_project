{"id":"273005387_Rectangular_maximum-volume_submatrices_and_their_applications","abstract":"We introduce a definition of the volume of a general rectangular matrix, which is equivalent to an absolute value of the determinant for square matrices. We generalize results of square maximum-volume submatrices to the rectangular case, show a connection of the rectangular volume with an optimal experimental design and provide estimates for a growth of coefficients and an approximation error in spectral and Chebyshev norms. Three promising applications of such submatrices are presented: recommender systems, finding maximal elements in low-rank matrices and preconditioning of overdetermined linear systems. The code is available online.","authors":["Alexander Mikhalev","Ivan Oseledets"],"meta":["February 2015Linear Algebra and its Applications 538","DOI:10.1016/j.laa.2017.10.014","SourcearXiv"],"references":["278685461_Preconditioning_Linear_Least-Squares_Problems_by_Identifying_a_Basis_Matrix","263745163_Preconditioning_of_linear_least-squares_problems_by_identifying_basic_variables","265369232_The_maximal-volume_concept_in_approximation_by_low-rank_matrices","251735015_How_to_Find_a_Good_Submatrix","242813731_A_good_submatrix_is_hard_to_find","238850744_Subset_selection_for_matrices","222738373_A_theory_of_pseudoskeleton_approximations","222557035_TT-cross_approximation_for_multidimensional_arrays","221140910_Wisdom_of_the_better_few_Cold_start_recommendation_via_representative_based_rating_elicitation","220086454_Global_and_Fast_Receiver_Antenna_Selection_for_MIMO_Systems"]}
