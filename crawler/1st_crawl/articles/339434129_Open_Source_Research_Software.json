{"id":"339434129_Open_Source_Research_Software","abstract":"In computational science and in computer science, research software is a central asset for research. For good scientific practice, the resulting research software should be open source software. Established open source software licenses provide sufficient licensing options, such that it should be the rare exception to keep research software closed. Proper research software engineering is required for obtaining reusable and sustainable research software. This way, software engineering methods may improve research in other disciplines. However, research in software engineering and computer science itself will also benefit from reuse when research software is involved. To study the state-of-the-art in this field, we analyzed research software publishing practices in computer science and in computational science, and observe significant differences: computational science emphasizes reproducibility, while computer science emphasizes reuse","authors":["Wilhelm Hasselbring","Leslie Carr","Simon Hettrick","Heather Packer"],"meta":["October 2019Computer 53(8)","DOI:10.1109/MC.2020.2998235"],"references":["339180131_From_FAIR_research_data_toward_FAIR_and_open_research_software","332432748_The_Innovations_of_Open_Source","333595376_Free_and_Open_Source_Software_Licenses_Explained","323789210_Software_Engineering_for_Computational_Science_Past_Present_Future"]}
