{"id":"273169767_Robust_Feedback_Design_for_Time_Reversal_UWB_Communication_Systems_Under_CSIT_Imperfections","abstract":"We propose a robust design for digital feedback of the channel impulse response in a time-reversal ultrawideband communication system. The proposed scheme employs channel optimized vector quantization to reduce distortion that occurs due to channel noise on the feedback link. Utilizing experimental channel measurements in a typical indoor environment, we indicate the robustness of the proposed strategy by showing that the scheme's performance remains resilient under channel mismatch conditions that arise due to the combined effect of quantization, feedback delay, and noise on the feedback channel.","authors":["Umer Zia","Momin Uppal","Ijaz Haider Naqvi"],"meta":["January 2015IEEE Communications Letters 19(1):102-105","DOI:10.1109/LCOMM.2014.2371997"],"references":["3234850_The_ultra-wide_bandwidth_indoor_channel_From_statistical_model_to_simulations","260673067_An_Algorithm_for_Vector_Quantizer_Design","258791973_An_Information_Theoretic_Take_on_Time_Reversal_for_Nonstationary_Channels","257674874_Effect_of_Channel_Estimation_Error_on_Time_Reversal_UWB_Communication_System","224334034_An_Overview_of_Limited_Feedback_in_Wireless_Communication_Systems","224227176_Robustness_of_a_time-reversal_ultra-wideband_system_in_non-stationary_channel_environments","224119888_Post-Time-Reversed_MIMO_Ultrawideband_Transmission_Scheme","220177433_Channel_Identification_Secret_Sharing_Using_Reciprocity_in_Ultrawideband_Channels","3077592_A_Study_of_Vector_Quantization_for_Noisy_Channels"]}
