{"id":"339515465_Practice_of_Programming_Education_using_Finger_Robot","abstract":"The movement of teaching computer science to children can be seen all over the world, but because it contains abstract content, it is difficult for children like elementary school students to understand it through lectures alone. The purpose of this study is to develop teaching materials that stimulate interest in the concept of binary numbers by using robots to teach computer science. As a result of having children use the developed material, it helped them understand binary numbers.","authors":["Kaito Omata","Shinichi Imai"],"meta":["February 2020Journal of Robotics Networking and Artificial Life 6(4)","DOI:10.2991/jrnal.k.200221.002"],"references":[]}
