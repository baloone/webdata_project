{"id":"222016048_Detection_of_singular_points_in_fingerprint_images","abstract":"This paper describes a technique for the detection of singular points in a fingerprint image. The singular points, namely the core and the delta points, are used as points of registration in fingerprint matching. This method makes use of structural information culled from the directional histograms of the directional image of a fingerprint. The usage of the histogram allows for a fairly high degree of noise tolerance.","authors":["V.S. Srinivasan","N.N.
