{"id":"309207166_A_2ell_k_Kernel_for_ell-Component_Order_Connectivity","abstract":"In the $\\ell$-Component Order Connectivity problem ($\\ell \\in \\mathbb{N}$), we are given a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices, $m$ edges and a non-negative integer $k$ and asks whether there exists a set of vertices $S\\subseteq V(G)$ such that $|S|\\leq k$ and the size of the largest connected component in $G-S$ is at most $\\ell$. In this paper, we give a kernel for $\\ell$-Component Order Connectivity with at most $2\\ell k$ vertices that takes $n^{\\mathcal{O}(\\ell)}$ time for every constant $\\ell$. On the way to obtaining our kernel, we prove a generalization of the $q$-Expansion Lemma to weighted graphs. This generalization may be of independent interest.","authors":["Mithilesh Kumar","Daniel Lokshtanov"],"meta":["October 2016"],"references":["286456702_Faster_Computation_of_the_Maximum_Dissociation_Set_and_Minimum_3-Path_Vertex_Cover_in_Graphs","317404417_Exact_Algorithms_for_Maximum_Independent_Set","299256330_Improved_parameterized_upper_bounds_for_vertex_cover","291015441_Fixed-parameter_algorithms_for_vertex_cover_P3","290627532_On_the_Computational_Complexity_of_Vertex_Integrity_and_Component_Order_Connectivity","286393717_A_survey_of_component_order_connectivity_models_of_graph_theoretic_networks","285766852_Recent_developments_in_kernelization_A_survey","278692986_Texts_in_Theoretical_Computer_Science_An_EATCS_Series","277306109_A_fixed-parameter_algorithm_for_the_vertex_cover_P3_problem","268019959_The_Design_of_Approximation_Algorithms"]}
