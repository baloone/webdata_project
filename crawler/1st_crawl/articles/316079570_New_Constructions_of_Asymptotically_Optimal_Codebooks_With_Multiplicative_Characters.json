{"id":"316079570_New_Constructions_of_Asymptotically_Optimal_Codebooks_With_Multiplicative_Characters","abstract":"In practical applications, such as direct spread code division multiple access communications, space-time codes and compressed sensing, codebooks with small inner-product correlation are required. It is extremely difficult to construct codebooks achieving the Levenshtein bound. In this paper, two new constructions of infinitely many codebooks with multiplicative characters of finite fields are presented. These constructions produce complex codebooks asymptotically achieving the Levenshtein bound and codebooks asymptotically achieving the Welch bound. The codebooks presented in this paper have new parameters.","authors":["ziling Heng","Cunsheng Ding","Qin Yue"],"meta":["April 2017IEEE Transactions on Information Theory PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TIT.2017.2693204"],"references":["260872388_Construction_of_Incoherent_Unit_Norm_Tight_Frames_With_Application_to_Compressed_Sensing","260800751_Deterministic_Sensing_Matrices_Arising_From_Near_Orthogonal_Systems","239062924_Z4-Kerdock_Codes_Orthogonal_Spreads_and_Extremal_Euclidean_Line-Sets","222565757_Grassmannian_Frames_with_Applications_to_Coding_and_Communication","220639278_Codebooks_from_almost_difference_sets","3084843_On_beamforming_with_finite_rate_feedback_in_multiple-antenna_systems","3080206_Systematic_Design_of_Unitary_Space-Time_Constellations","2242859_Welch's_Bound_and_Sequence_Sets_for_Code-Division_Multiple-Access_Systems","305695566_A_Construction_of_Codebooks_Nearly_Achieving_the_Levenstein_Bound","303914714_Optimal_codebooks_achieving_the_Levenshtein_bound_from_generalized_bent_functions_over_Z_4_mathbb_Z_4","301847046_Equiangular_tight_frames_from_hyperovals","301845871_Tremain_equiangular_tight_frames","285296495_Packing_in_grassmannian_spaces","282900218_Optimal_Codebooks_From_Binary_Codes_Meeting_the_Levenshtein_Bound","274403287_Tables_of_the_existence_of_equiangular_tight_frames","273394714_New_Families_of_Codebooks_Achieving_the_Levenstein_Bound","267172731_New_nearly_optimal_codebooks_from_relative_difference_sets","260712444_New_Constructions_of_Codebooks_Nearly_Meeting_the_Welch_Bound_With_Equality","258162338_Two_families_of_nearly_optimal_codebooks","257765646_Bounds_for_packings_of_metric_spaces_and_some_of_their_applications","254061567_A_Construction_of_Codebooks_Associated_With_Binary_Sequences","254056958_Two_Classes_of_Codebooks_Nearly_Meeting_the_Welch_Bound","222468090_Optimal_state-determination_by_mutually_unbiased_measurements","46588039_Steiner_equiangular_tight_frames","3162278_Signal_Sets_From_Functions_With_Optimum_Nonlinearity","3086571_A_Generic_Construction_of_Complex_Codebooks_Meeting_the_Welch_Bound","3085998_Complex_Codebooks_From_Combinatorial_Designs","3085429_Achieving_the_Welch_Bound_With_Difference_Sets","3084837_Grassmannian_beamforming_for_multiple-input_multiple-output_wireless_systems","3084598_Existence_and_construction_of_noncoherent_unitary_space-time_codes","3082399_Lower_bounds_on_the_maximum_cross_correlation_of_signals_Corresp","2670177_Meeting_the_Welch_Bound_with_Equality"]}
