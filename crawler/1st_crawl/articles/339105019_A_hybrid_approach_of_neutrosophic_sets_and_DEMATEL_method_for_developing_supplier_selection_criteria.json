{"id":"339105019_A_hybrid_approach_of_neutrosophic_sets_and_DEMATEL_method_for_developing_supplier_selection_criteria","abstract":"For any organization, the selection of suppliers is a very important step to increase productivity and profitability. Any organization or company seeks to use the best methodology and the appropriate technology to achieve its strategies and objectives. The present study employs the neutrosophic set for decision making and evaluation method (DEMATEL) to analyze and determine the factors influencing the selection of SCM suppliers. DEMATEL is considered a proactive approach to improve performance and achieve competitive advantages. This study applies the neutrosophic set Theory to adjust general judgment, using a new scale to present each value. A case study implementing the proposed methodology is presented (i.e. selecting the best supplier for a distribution company). This research was designed by neutrosophic DEMATEL data collection survey of experts, interviewing professionals in management, procurement and production. The results analyzed in our research prove that quality is the most influential criterion in the selection of suppliers.","authors":["Mohamed Abdel-Basset","Gunasekaran Manogaran","Abduallah Gamal","Florentin Smarandache"],"meta":["September 2018Design Automation for Embedded Systems 22(4)","DOI:10.1007/s10617-018-9203-6"],"references":["328018620_Neutrosophic_Goal_Programming","320599056_Using_DEMATEL_and_Intuitionistic_Fuzzy_Sets_to_Identify_Critical_Factors_Influencing_the_Recycling_Rate_of_End-Of-Life_Vehicles_in_China","318928878_A_novel_group_decision-making_model_based_on_triangular_neutrosophic_numbers","318673431_Neutrosophic_Goal_Programming","318610968_Merger_and_Acquisition_Target_Selection_Based_on_Interval_Neutrosophic_Multigranulation_Rough_Sets_over_Two_Universes","318577411_Neutrosophic_AHP-Delphi_Group_decision_making_model_based_on_trapezoidal_neutrosophic_numbers","327370544_NMCDA_A_framework_for_evaluating_cloud_computing_services","321447507_Multi-criteria_group_decision_making_based_on_neutrosophic_analytic_hierarchy_process","316799334_Decision_Making_with_the_Analytic_Network_Process","315759790_Supply_Chain_Management"]}
