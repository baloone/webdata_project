{"id":"305081807_Learning_to_Program_is_Easy","abstract":"The orthodox view that \"programming is difficult to learn\" leads to uncritical teaching practices and poor student outcomes. It may also impact negatively on diversity and equity within the Computer Science discipline. But learning to program is easy --- so easy that children can do it. We make our introductory courses difficult by establishing unrealistic expectations for novice programming students. By revisiting the expected norms for introductory programming we may be able to substantially improve outcomes for novice programmers, address negative impressions of disciplinary practices and create a more equitable environment.","authors":["Andrew Luxton-Reilly"],"meta":["July 2016","DOI:10.1145/2899415.2899432","Conference: the 2016 ACM Conference"],"references":["283110109_Not_all_curves_are_the_same_Left-of-center_grading_and_student_motivation","266657024_Programming_Reading_writing_and_reversing","264978853_The_Australian_Digital_Technologies_Curriculum_Challenge_and_Opportunity","324373353_Mindstorms_Children_Computers_and_Powerful_Ideas","301454106_Exploring_societal_factors_affecting_the_experience_and_engagement_of_first_year_female_computer_science_undergraduates","283232545_Drop_Fail_Pass_Continue_Persistence_in_CS1_and_Beyond_in_Traditional_and_Inverted_Delivery","277374591_Lowering_the_barriers_to_programming","270607054_Not_seeing_the_forest_for_the_trees","266657039_Failure_rates_in_introductory_programming_revisited","264543793_Restart_The_Resurgence_of_Computer_Science_in_UK_Schools"]}
