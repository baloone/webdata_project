{"id":"220437214_Two-Stage_Monte_Carlo_Tree_Search_for_Connect6","abstract":"Recently, Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) has be- come a well-known game search method, and has been successfully applied to many games. This method performs well in solving search trees with numerous branches, such as Go, Havannah, etc. Connect6 is a game involving a search tree with numerous branches, and it is also one of the sudden-death games. This paper thus proposes a new MCTS variant related to Connect6, called two-stage MCTS. The first stage focuses on threat space search (TSS), which is designed to solve the sudden-death problem. For the double-threat TSS in Connect6, this study proposes an algo- rithm called iterative threat space search (ITSS) which combines normal TSS with conservative threat space search (CTSS). The second stage uses MCTS to estimate the game-theoretic value of the initial position. This stage aims at finding the most promising move. The experimental result shows that two-stage MCTS is considerably more efficient than traditional MCTS on those positions with TSS solution in Connect6. Furthermore, according to Connect6 heuristic knowledge, this paper uses relevance-zone search to accelerate identifying winning and losing moves.
