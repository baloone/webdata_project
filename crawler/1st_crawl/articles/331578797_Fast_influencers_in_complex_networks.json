{"id":"331578797_Fast_influencers_in_complex_networks","abstract":"Influential nodes in complex networks are typically defined as those nodes that maximize the asymptotic reach of a spreading process of interest. However, for practical applications such as viral marketing and online information spreading, one is often interested in maximizing the reach of the process in a short amount of time. The traditional definition of influencers in network-related studies from diverse research fields narrows down the focus to the late-time state of the spreading processes, leaving the following question unsolved: which nodes are able to initiate large-scale spreading processes, in a limited amount of time? Here, we find that there is a fundamental difference between the nodes -- which we call ``fast influencers\" -- that initiate the largest-reach processes in a short amount of time, and the traditional, ``late-time\" influencers. Stimulated by this observation, we provide an extensive benchmarking of centrality metrics with respect to their ability to identify both the fast and late-time influencers. We find that local network properties can be used to uncover the fast influencers. In particular, a parsimonious, local centrality metric (which we call social capital) achieves optimal or nearly-optimal performance in the fast influencer identification for all the analyzed empirical networks. Local metrics tend to be also competitive in the traditional, late-time influencer identification task.","authors":["Fang Zhou","Linyuan LÃ¼","Manuel Sebastian Mariani"],"meta":["March 2019Communications in Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulation 74","DOI:10.1016/j.cnsns.2019.01.032"],"references":[]}
