{"id":"233175873_EG-eliminations","abstract":"We propose an algorithm to put linear recurrent systems in a form which is convenient for using the systems to search for polynomial, power series, Laurent series, and other types of solutions of various linear functional systems (differential,difference and q-difference). Some algorithms to search for solutions of functional systems are described. None of the proposed algorithms requires preliminary uncoupling of linear systems","authors":["Sergei A.
