{"id":"349619724_Preparing_Special_Education_Preservice_Teachers_to_Teach_Computational_Thinking_and_Computer_Science_in_Mathematics","abstract":"Increasingly in Kâ€“12 schools, students are gaining access to computational thinking (CT) and computer science (CS). This access, however, is not always extended to students with disabilities. One way to increase CT and CS (CT/CS) exposure for students with disabilities is through preparing special education teachers to do so. In this study, researchers explore exposing special education preservice teachers to the ideas of CT/CS in the context of a mathematics methods course for students with disabilities or those at risk of disability. Through analyzing lesson plans and reflections from 31 preservice special education teachers, the researchers learned that overall emerging promise exists with regard to the limited exposure of preservice special education teachers to CT/CS in mathematics. Specifically, preservice teachers demonstrated the ability to include CT/CS in math lesson plans and showed understanding of how CT/CS might enhance instruction with students with disabilities via reflections on these lessons. The researchers, however, also found a need for increased experiences and opportunities for preservice special education teachers with CT/CS to more positively impact access for students with disabilities.","authors":["Emily C Bouck","Phil Sands","Holly Long","Aman Yadav"],"meta":["February 2021Teacher Education and Special Education The Journal of the Teacher Education Division of the Council for Exceptional Children 44(3):088840642199237","DOI:10.1177/0888406421992376"],"references":["337386137_Computational_Thinking_Mathematics_and_Science_Elementary_Teachers'_Perspectives_on_Integration","334213237_Early_Elementary_Science_Instruction_Does_More_Time_on_Science_or_Science_TopicsSkills_Predict_Science_Achievement_in_the_Early_Grades","333642505_Development_of_computational_thinking_digital_competence_and_21st_century_skills_when_learning_programming_in_K-9","332886838_Teaching_Digital_Block-Based_Coding_of_Robots_to_High_School_Students_with_Autism_Spectrum_Disorder_and_Challenging_Behavior","330949034_Teaching_Robotics_Coding_to_a_Student_with_ASD_and_Severe_Problem_Behavior","328056732_Infusing_computational_thinking_into_middle_grade_science_classrooms_lessons_learned","339149095_Teacher_Preconceptions_of_Computational_Thinking_A_Systematic_Literature_Review","337995781_Rethinking_Shortages_in_Special_Education_Making_Good_on_the_Promise_of_an_Equal_Opportunity_for_Students_With_Disabilities","327043184_School_embedded_and_district-wide_instructional_coaching_in_K-8_computer_science_Implications_for_including_students_with_disabilities","326217842_A_Framework_for_Computational_Thinking_Dispositions_in_Mathematics_Education","321760448_A_Scoping_Review_of_Studies_on_Computational_Thinking_in_K-12_Mathematics_Classrooms","318675079_Resetting_educational_technology_coursework_for_pre-service_teachers_A_computational_thinking_approach_to_the_development_of_technological_pedagogical_content_knowledge_TPACK","323325225_A_Cross-Case_Analysis_of_Instructional_Strategies_to_Support_Participation_of_K-8_Students_with_Disabilities_in_CS_for_All","319447670_Teacher_Attrition_in_Special_Education_Perspectives_From_the_Field","316895794_Teacher_Feedback_on_Delivering_Computational_Thinking_in_Primary_School"]}
