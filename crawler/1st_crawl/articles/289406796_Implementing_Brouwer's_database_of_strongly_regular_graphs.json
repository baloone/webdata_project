{"id":"289406796_Implementing_Brouwer's_database_of_strongly_regular_graphs","abstract":"Andries Brouwer maintains a public database of existence results for strongly regular graphs on \\(n\\le 1300\\) vertices. We have implemented most of the infinite families of graphs listed there in the open-source software Sagemath (The Sage Developers, http://www.sagemath.org), as well as provided constructions of the “sporadic” cases, to obtain a graph for each set of parameters with known examples. Besides providing a convenient way to verify these existence results from the actual graphs, it also extends the database to higher values of n.","authors":["Nathann Cohen","Dmitrii V.
