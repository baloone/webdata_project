{"id":"298769251_Students'_Attitudes_and_Motivation_During_Robotics_Activities","abstract":"This work investigates students' attitudes towards and motivation for learning robotics and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics). The population consisted of middle-school students (ages 13-15 years) who participated in the FIRST® LEGO® League competition. The methodology used both qualitative and quantitative instruments: questionnaires, observations and interviews during the school year 2012--2013. Research continued with one group during 2013--2014. Four categories were investigated: intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, self-determination and self-efficacy, as well as other environmental factors (gender, peers, parents and teachers). The results showed no significant difference between the beginning and end of the activities on all the categories. We consider this as a positive indicator, since most of the students demonstrated high and positive attitudes toward and motivation for learning robotics at the beginning of the activities and maintained the results after the activities. The environmental factors played an important role in positively influencing students' attitudes and motivation. In particular, females showed more positive attitudes and motivation at the end of the activities.","authors":["Fatima Kaloti-Hallak","Michal Armoni","Mordechai Ben-Ari"],"meta":["November 2015","DOI:10.1145/2818314.2818317","Conference: The 10th Workshop in Primary and Secondary Computing Education (WiPSCE2015)At: London, UKVolume: Proceedings of the 10th Workshop in Primary and Secondary Computing Education (pp. 102-110)","Project: Teaching robotics in middle schools"],"references":["271658929_A_Predictive_Study_of_Learner_Attitudes_Toward_Open_Learning_in_a_Robotics_Class","248975096_Attitudes_towards_Science_A_Review_of_the_Literature_and_its_Implications_International_Journal_of_Science_Education_259_1049-1079","241623861_Learning_to_Program_with_Personal_Robots_Influences_on_Student_Motivation","220094592_Robot_contest_as_a_laboratory_for_experiential_engineering_education","11946306_Self-Determination_Theory_and_the_Facilitation_of_Intrinsic_Motivation_Social_Development_and_Well-Being","316823281_Self-efficacy_the_exercise_of_control","292134960_CSbots","285831994_Self-Efficacy_The_Exercise_of_Control","280758090_Motivational_and_Self-Regulated_Learning_Components_of_Classroom_Academic_Performance","267975217_More_than_Robots_An_Evaluation_of_the_FIRST_Robotics_Competition_Participant_and_Institutional_Impacts","262692663_Attending_to_Affect","254002577_Affecting_attitudes_in_first-year_computer_science_using_syntaxfree_robotics_programming","238789537_Attitude_towards_science_A_review_of_the_literature_and_its_implications","236577471_So_that's_what_Pi_is_for_and_other_educational_epiphanies_from_hands-on_robotics","232517939_Motivated_and_Self-Regulated_Learning_Components_of_Classroom_Academic_Performance","230557429_Self-Efficacy_Mechanism_in_Human_Agency","230523935_Adolescents'_Declining_Motivation_to_Learn_Science_Inevitable_or_Not","229068345_Self-Efficacy_The_Exercise_of_Control","227724374_Science_Motivation_Questionnaire_II_Validation_With_Science_Majors_and_Nonscience_Majors","221537807_CSbots_Design_and_deployment_of_a_robot_designed_for_the_CS1_classroom","221537635_Do_LEGOR_mindstormsR_motivate_students_in_CS1","220807548_Creativity_and_intrinsic_motivation_in_computer_science_education_Experimenting_with_robots","2403277_Quantifying_Qualitative_Analyses_of_Verbal_Data_A_Practical_Guide"]}
