{"id":"348399476_A_quantum_circuit_simulator_and_its_applications_on_Sunway_TaihuLight_supercomputer","abstract":"Classical simulation of quantum computation is vital for verifying quantum devices and assessing quantum algorithms. We present a new quantum circuit simulator developed on the Sunway TaihuLight supercomputer. Compared with other simulators, the present one is distinguished in two aspects. First, our simulator is more versatile. The simulator consists of three mutually independent parts to compute the full, partial and single amplitudes of a quantum state with different methods. It has the function of emulating the effect of noise and support more kinds of quantum operations. Second, our simulator is of high efficiency. The simulator is designed in a two-level parallel structure to be implemented efficiently on the distributed many-core Sunway TaihuLight supercomputer. Random quantum circuits can be simulated with 40, 75 and 200 qubits on the full, partial and single amplitude, respectively. As illustrative applications of the simulator, we present a quantum fast Poisson solver and an algorithm for quantum arithmetic of evaluating transcendental functions. Our simulator is expected to have broader applications in developing quantum algorithms in various fields.","authors":["Zhimin Wang","Zhaoyun Chen","Shengbin Wang","Wendong Li"],"meta":["January 2021Scientific Reports 11(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-020-79777-y"],"references":["350081492_Hyper-optimized_tensor_network_contraction","345366622_Quantum_circuits_design_for_evaluating_transcendental_functions_based_on_a_function-value_binary_expansion_method","341305394_How_many_qubits_are_needed_for_quantum_computational_supremacy","340659695_Quantum_fast_Poisson_solver_the_algorithm_and_complete_and_modular_circuit_design","337994002_Superconducting_Qubits_Current_State_of_Play","337015909_General-Purpose_Quantum_Circuit_Simulator_with_Projected_Entangled-Pair_States_and_the_Quantum_Supremacy_Frontier","336744162_Quantum_supremacy_using_a_programmable_superconducting_processor","339858872_Establishing_the_quantum_supremacy_frontier_with_a_281_Pflops_simulation","339522782_Quantum-Teleportation-Inspired_Algorithm_for_Sampling_Large_Random_Quantum_Circuits","333662947_Scaling_Reconfigurable_Emulation_of_Quantum_Algorithms_at_High-Precision_and_High-Throughput"]}
