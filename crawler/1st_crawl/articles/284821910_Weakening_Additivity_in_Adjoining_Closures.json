{"id":"284821910_Weakening_Additivity_in_Adjoining_Closures","abstract":"In this paper, we weaken the conditions for the existence of adjoint closure operators, going beyond the standard requirement of additivity/co-additivity. We consider the notion of join-uniform (lower) closure operators, introduced in computer science, in order to model perfect lossless compression in transformations acting on complete lattices. Starting from Janowitzâ€™s characterization of residuated closure operators, we show that join-uniformity perfectly weakens additivity in the construction of adjoint closures, and this is indeed the weakest property for this to hold. We conclude by characterizing the set of all join-uniform lower closure operators as fix-points of a function defined on the set of all lower closures of a complete lattice.","authors":["Isabella Mastroeni","Roberto Giacobazzi"],"meta":["November 2016Order 33(3)","DOI:10.1007/s11083-015-9381-9"],"references":["268637110_A_constructive_characterization_of_the_lattices_of_all_retractions_preclosure_quasi-closure_and_closure_operators_on_a_complete_lattice","221602471_The_ASTREE_analyzer","220997507_Abstract_Interpretation_A_Unified_Lattice_Model_for_Static_Analysis_of_Programs_by_Construction_or_Approximation_of_Fixpoints","268753736_Residuated_closure_operators","266523703_The_closure_operators_of_a_lattice","243764203_Some_results_on_the_closure_operators_of_partially_ordered_sets","242533283_Classes_of_Recursively_Enumerable_Sets_and_Their_Decision_Problems","239583374_On_the_Closure_Operators_of_a_Complete_Lattice","222477542_Optimal_domains_for_disjunctive_abstract_interpretation","222469656_Uniform_Closures_Order-Theoretically_Reconstructing_Logic_Program_Semantics_and_Abstract_Domain_Refinements","220997433_Systematic_Design_of_Program_Analysis_Frameworks","220898837_Refining_and_Compressing_Abstract_Domains","220431290_Counterexample-guided_abstraction_refinement_for_symbolic_model_checking","220431053_Making_Abstract_Interpretations_Complete"]}
