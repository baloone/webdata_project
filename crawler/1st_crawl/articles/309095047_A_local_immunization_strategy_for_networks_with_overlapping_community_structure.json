{"id":"309095047_A_local_immunization_strategy_for_networks_with_overlapping_community_structure","abstract":"Since full coverage treatment is not feasible due to limited resources, we need to utilize an immunization strategy to effectively distribute the available vaccines. On the other hand, the structure of contact network among people has a significant impact on epidemics of infectious diseases (such as SARS and influenza) in a population. Therefore, network-based immunization strategies aim to reduce the spreading rate by removing the vaccinated nodes from contact network. Such strategies try to identify more important nodes in epidemics spreading over a network. In this paper, we address the effect of overlapping nodes among communities on epidemics spreading. The proposed strategy is an optimized random-walk based selection of these nodes. The whole process is local, i.e. it requires contact network information in the level of nodes. Thus, it is applicable to large-scale and unknown networks in which the global methods usually are unrealizable. Our simulation results on different synthetic and real networks show that the proposed method outperforms the existing local methods in most cases. In particular, for networks with strong community structures, high overlapping membership of nodes or small size communities, the proposed method shows better performance.","authors":["Fatemeh Taghavian","Mostafa Salehi","Mehdi Teimouri"],"meta":["October 2016Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications 467","DOI:10.1016/j.physa.2016.10.014"],"references":["277609284_Spreading_Processes_in_Multilayer_Networks","259492817_An_Efficient_Immunization_Strategy_for_Community_Networks","248396266_Global_efficiency_of_local_immunization_on_complex_networks","228113266_Sampling_from_complex_networks_with_high_community_structures","225533503_Immunization_and_Epidemic_Dynamics_in_Complex_Networks","223991911_Absence_of_influential_spreaders_in_rumor_dynamics","51951775_Overlapping_Community_Detection_in_Networks_The_State-of-the-Art_and_Comparative_Study","51114548_Finding_Statistically_Significant_Communities_in_Networks","50851336_Networks_and_the_Epidemiology_of_Infectious_Disease","45898153_Identification_of_influential_spreaders_in_complex_networks","43131844_Jones_JH_Dynamics_and_control_of_diseases_in_networks_with_community_structure_PLoS_Comput_Biol_68_e1000736","8953063_Efficient_Immunization_Strategies_for_Computer_Networks_and_Populations","7476817_Superspreading_and_the_Effect_of_Individual_Variation_on_Disease_Emergence","309119941_Evaluation_of_military_engine_service_reliability","264920260_Networks_An_Introduction","264708826_Epidemic_processes_in_complex_networks","254009916_A_New_Immunization_Strategy_for_Complex_Network","240584723_SARS_A_Case_Study_in_Emerging_Infections","232771086_Uncovering_the_overlapping_community_structure_of_complex_networks_in_nature_and_society","231019334_Efficient_local_strategies_for_vaccination_and_network_attack","227856755_Identifying_Influential_and_Susceptible_Members_of_Social_Networks","222671188_A_Measure_of_Betweenness_Centrality_based_on_Random_Walks","23464007_Benchmark_graphs_for_testing_community_detection_algorithms","11925397_Epidemic_dynamics_and_endemic_states_in_complex_networks_J","11455531_Immunization_of_Complex_Networks","7060226_Newman_MEJ_Modularity_and_community_structure_in_networks_Proc_Natl_Acad_Sci_USA_103_8577-8582"]}
