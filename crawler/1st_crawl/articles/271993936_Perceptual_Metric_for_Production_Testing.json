{"id":"271993936_Perceptual_Metric_for_Production_Testing","abstract":"This paper describes a perceptually based image comparison processtliat can be used to tell when images are perceptually identical even though they contain imperceptible numerical differences. The technique has shown much utility in the production testing of rendering software.","authors":["Hector Yee"],"meta":["January 2004Journal of Graphics Tools 9(4):33-40","DOI:10.1080/10867651.2004.10504900"],"references":["3410826_A_Visibility_Matching_Tone_Reproduction_Operator_for_High_Dynamic_Range_Scenes","301077064_COLOR_SPACES","242416048_A_visual_discrimination_model_for_imaging_system_design_and_evaluation","234176206_Square_root_integral_a_new_metric_to_describe_the_effect_of_various_display_parameters_on_perceived_image_quality","224733267_The_Laplacian_Pyramid_as_a_Compact_Image_Code","2466948_A_Perceptually_Based_Physical_Error_Metric_for_Realistic_Image_Synthesis"]}
