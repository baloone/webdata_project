{"id":"280688730_Algorithms_for_vertex_partitioning_problems_on_partial_-trees","abstract":"In this paper, we consider a large class of vertex partitioning problems and apply to them the theory of algorithm design for problems restricted to partial κ-trees. We carefully describe the details of algorithms and analyze their complexity in an attempt to make the algorithms feasible as solutions for practical applications. We give a precise characterization of vertex partitioning problems, which include domination, coloring and packing problems, and their variants. Several new graph parameters are introduced as generalizations of classical parameters. This characterization provides a basis for a taxonomy of a large class of problems, facilitating their common algorithmic treatment and allowing their uniform complexity classification. We present a design methodology of practical solution algorithms for generally NP-hard problems when restricted to partial κ-trees (graphs with treewidth bounded by κ). This \"practicality\" accounts for dependency on the parameter κ of the computational complexity of the resulting algorithms. By adapting the algorithm design methodology on partial κ-trees to vertex partitioning problems, we obtain the first algorithms for these problems with reasonable time complexity as a function of treewidth. As an application of the methodology, we give the first polynomial-time algorithm on partial κ-trees for computation of the Grundy number.","authors":["J.A.
