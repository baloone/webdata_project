{"id":"241758881_Guaranteed_nonlinear_state_estimation_for_continuous-_time_dynamical_models_from_discrete-time_measurements","abstract":"This paper is about bounded-error state estimation for models described by a continuous-time state equation from discrete-time measurements. A guaranteed solution to this problem is proposed, based on MÃ¼ller's theorems and i nterval analysis. This technique allows, at any time instant, the characterizatio n of the set of all state vectors that are consistent with the error bounds, measurements and model structure. Joint state and parameter estimation is also possible. The resulting methodology is illustrated on the estimation of the state of a compartmental model.","authors":["Michel Kieffer","Eric Walter"],"meta":["July 2006","DOI:10.3182/20060705-3-FR-2907.00117"],"references":["243041034_Interval_Analysis_for_Guaranteed_Nonlinear_Parameter_and_State_Estimation","238851271_A_New_Extension_of_Classical_Muller's_Theorem"]}
