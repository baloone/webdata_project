{"id":"269711187_The_Next_700_Impossibility_Results_in_Time-Varying_Graphs","abstract":"We address highly dynamic distributed systems modeled by time-varying graphs\n(TVGs). We interest in proof of impossibility results that often use informal\narguments about convergence. First, we provide a distance among TVGs to define\ncorrectly the convergence of TVG sequences. Next, we provide a general\nframework that formally proves the convergence of the sequence of executions of\nany deterministic algorithm over TVGs of any convergent sequence of TVGs.\nFinally, we illustrate the relevance of the above result by proving that no\ndeterministic algorithm exists to compute the underlying graph of any\nconnected-over-time TVG, i.e., any TVG of the weakest class of long-lived TVGs.","authors":["Nicolas Braud-Santoni","Swan Dubois","Mohamed-Hamza Kaaouachi","Franck Petit"],"meta":["December 2014International Journal of Networking and Computing 6(1)","DOI:10.15803/ijnc.6.1_27","SourcearXiv"],"references":["232144690_Shortest_Fastest_and_Foremost_Broadcast_in_Dynamic_Networks","228469564_Algorithms_on_evolving_graphs","221344208_Coloring_Unstructured_Wireless_Multi-Hop_Networks","221233356_Characterizing_Topological_Assumptions_of_Distributed_Algorithms_in_Dynamic_Networks","221221859_Deterministic_Computations_in_Time-Varying_Graphs_Broadcasting_under_Unstructured_Mobility","220567129_An_optimal_maximal_independent_set_algorithm_for_bounded-independence_graphs","308605649_A_Generic_Framework_for_Impossibility_Results_in_Time-Varying_Graphs","278627585_Computing_shortest_fastest_and_foremost_journeys_in_dynamic_networks","221343634_Efficient_and_Reliable_Broadcast_is_Achievable_in_an_Eventually_Connected_Network","221164098_A_Delay-Tolerant_Network_Architecture_for_Challenged_Internets"]}
