{"id":"340131314_Visualization_technology_in_Computer_Science","abstract":"This paper focuses on the analysis of data preprocessing and data periodic regression under the condition of complex data. It includes a linear data projection technology, a nonlinear data projection technology, a data periodic regression technology and a more intuitive data visualization display technology after data periodic regression. Through the above technology, we can make the complex data more intuitive display, and show the details of the relatively dense part of the data.","authors":["Kuntian Chen"],"meta":["March 2020IOP Conference Series Materials Science and Engineering 750(1):012183","DOI:10.1088/1757-899X/750/1/012183"],"references":["333173074_Relevant_visualization_technologies_for_latent_fingerprints_on_wet_objects_and_its_challenges_a_review"]}
