{"id":"322190542_Safety_and_Security_in_Cyber-Physical_Systems_and_Internet-of-Things_Systems","abstract":"Safety and security have traditionally been distinct problems in engineering and computer science. The introduction of computing elements to create cyber-physical systems (CPSs) has opened up a vast new range of potential problems that do not always show up on the radar of traditional engineers. Security, in contrast, is traditionally viewed as a data or communications security problem to be handled by computer scientists and/or computer engineers. Advances in CPSs and the Internet-of-Things (IoT) requires us to take a unified view of safety and security. This paper defines a safety/security threat model for CPSs and IoT systems and surveys emerging techniques which improve the safety and security of CPSs and IoT systems.","authors":["Marilyn Wolf","Dimitrios Serpanos"],"meta":["January 2018Proceedings of the IEEE 106(1):9-20","DOI:10.1109/JPROC.2017.2781198"],"references":["311948154_Golden-Free_Hardware_Trojan_Detection_with_High_Sensitivity_Under_Process_Noise","301272911_Challenges_in_Autonomous_Vehicle_Testing_and_Validation","286593097_Monitor_Based_Oracles_for_Cyber-Physical_System_Testing_Practical_Experience_Report","286404534_Towards_Assurance_for_Plug_Play_Medical_Systems","283725438_Exciting_FPGA_Cryptographic_Trojans_using_Combinatorial_Testing","282580739_A_Hybrid_Approach_to_Causality_Analysis","275647221_Hardware_Trojan_Detection_by_Delay_and_Electromagnetic_Measurements","275558568_A_Novel_Fuzzing_Method_for_Zigbee_Based_on_Finite_State_Machine","273615269_Instrumentation_and_Modeling_of_I-35W_St_Anthony_Falls_Bridge","269323419_Development_of_an_Extensible_Dual-Core_Wireless_Sensing_Node_for_Cyber-Physical_Systems","261959274_Safety-Critical_Medical_Device_Development_Using_the_UPP2SF_Model_Translation_Tool","261162421_Practical_measurements_of_data_path_delays_for_IP_authentication_integrity_verification","259753269_Comprehensive_Experimental_Analyses_of_Automotive_Attack_Surfaces","255571249_A_Summary_Review_of_Wireless_Sensors_and_Sensor_Networks_for_Structural_Health_Monitoring","252192295_Using_Model-based_Intrusion_Detection_for_SCADA_Networks","224596725_System_Safety_as_an_Emergent_Property_in_Composite_Systems","224153226_A_Comprehensive_Diagnosis_Methodology_for_Complex_Hybrid_Systems_A_Case_Study_on_Spacecraft_Power_Distribution_Systems","224111760_A_Survey_of_Hardware_Trojan_Taxonomy_and_Detection","221627859_Power_supply_signal_calibration_techniques_for_improving_detection_resolution_to_hardware_Trojans","221626495_Consistency-based_characterization_for_IC_Trojan_detection","221337217_New_Design_Strategy_for_Improving_Hardware_Trojan_Detection_and_Reducing_Trojan_Activation_Time","221043514_Cyber_Security_Analysis_of_State_Estimators_in_Electric_Power_Systems","320050100_Improving_the_Safety_and_Security_of_Wide-Area_Cyber-Physical_Systems_Through_a_Resource-Aware_Service-Oriented_Development_Methodology","316905805_Who's_in_Control_of_Your_Control_System_Device_Fingerprinting_for_Cyber-Physical_Systems","311609657_Grammar-based_adaptive_fuzzing_Evaluation_on_SCADA_modbus_protocol","308840388_Fuzzing_CAN_Packets_into_Automobiles","308814596_A_ModbusTCP_Fuzzer_for_testing_internetworked_industrial_systems","308543129_IoT_Components_for_Secure_Smart_Building_Environments","305629016_UrWeb_A_simple_model_for_programming_the_web","304411088_Automated_vulnerability_analysis_of_AC_state_estimation_under_constrained_false_data_injection_in_electric_power_systems","300483781_Peach_Improvement_on_Profinet-DCP_for_Industrial_Control_System_Vulnerability_Detection","300410266_IT_vs_OT_Security_A_Time_to_Consider_a_Change_in_CIA_to_Include_Resilienc","290472095_Embedded_Software_in_Crisis","289436771_Towards_a_hardware_trojan_detection_methodology","275643070_Design_Tool_Chain_for_Cyber-Physical_Systems_Lessons_Learned","265850889_Towards_a_Hardware_Trojan_Detection_Methodology","265033454_Fuzzing_for_Software_Security_Testing_and_Quality_Assurance","262402153_A_Survey_of_Intrusion_Detection_Techniques_for_Cyber-Physical_Systems","261148150_Autocoding_control_software_with_proofs_I_Annotation_translation","261082544_Temperature_tracking_An_innovative_run-time_approach_for_hardware_Trojan_detection","261073790_A_formal_model_for_verifying_stealthy_attacks_on_state_estimation_in_power_grids","261046649_False_data_injection_attacks_with_incomplete_information_against_smart_power_grids","260586655_A_Clock_Sweeping_Technique_for_Detecting_Hardware_Trojans_Impacting_Circuits_Delay","260582057_Vulnerability_Assessment_of_AC_State_Estimation_With_Respect_to_False_Data_Injection_Cyber-Attacks","247657712_Structural_Control_Past_Present_and_Future","242371658_G_safeware_system_safety_and_computers","236677959_W32Stuxnet_Dossier","234135951_DDoS_Attacks_and_DDoS_against_DNS","224183249_Trustworthy_Hardware_Identifying_and_Classifying_Hardware_Trojans","221609687_Attacks_against_process_control_systems_Risk_assessment_detection_and_response","220605037_Computational_Vulnerability_Analysis_for_Information_Survivability","220997402_A_Language_for_Automatically_Enforcing_Privacy_Policies","220700074_Indirect_Control_Path_Analysis_and_Goal_Coverage_Strategies_for_Elaborating_System_Safety_Goals_in_Composite_Systems","220693634_Better_Embedded_System_Software","220648980_Security_Against_Hardware_Trojan_Attacks_Using_Key-Based_Design_Obfuscation"]}
