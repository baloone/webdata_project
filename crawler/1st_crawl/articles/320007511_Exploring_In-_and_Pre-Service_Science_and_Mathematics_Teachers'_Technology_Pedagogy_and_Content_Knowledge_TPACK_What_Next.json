The purpose of this study is to develop and apply a framework that captures some of the essential qualities of the knowledge required by teachers for effective pedagogical practice in a technology-enhanced educational environment using technology and pedagogy content knowledge (TPACK). A TPACK Short and Quick (TPACK-SQ) survey questionnaire was used to explore and assess 244 in- and pre-service science and mathematics teachers in Kuwait. The results of the survey showed that in-service teachers needed help with some aspects of TPACK. Therefore, a workshop was developed and 57 in-service teachers were enrolled and trained based on the TPACK-SQ model. The results of posttests for their knowledge were significantly positive as against pretests. The workshop thus provides a rich example of how to support the implementation of essential elements of the TPACK-SQ model.","authors":["Noha Alrwaished","Ali Alkandari","Fatimah Alhashem"],"meta":["August 2017Eurasia Journal of Mathematics, Science and Technology Education 13(9):6113-6131","DOI:10.12973/eurasia.2017.01053a"],"references":["309411288_THE_IMPACT_OF_USING_THE_KIDSMART_PROGRAM_ON_FACILITATING_CHILDREN'S_ACCESS_AND_USE_OF_ICT_TOOLS_ACCORDING_TO_JORDANIAN_PUBLIC_KINDERGARTEN_TEACHERS'_VIEWPOINT","285956597_Challenges_to_creating_an_Arabian_Gulf_knowledge_economy","284547207_What_Did_Kuwait_Learn_from_Its_Participation_in_TIMSS_Study_An_Exploratory_Case_Study_from_Senior_Supervisors'_Perspectives","271937971_Technological_Pedagogical_Content_Knowledge_TPACK_in_Action","264145709_Fostering_Pre-service_STEM_Teachers'_Technological_Pedagogical_Content_Knowledge_A_Lesson_Learned_from_Case-based_Learning_Approach","255629738_Examining_TPACK_among_K-12_online_distance_educators_in_the_United_States","249704767_Rethinking_the_Connections_Between_Campus_Courses_and_Field_Experiences_in_College_and_University-Based_Teacher_Education","239918048_Technological_Pedagogical_Content_Knowledge_TPACK_The_Development_and_Validation_of_an_Assessment_Instrument_for_Preservice_Teachers","234631741_An_Investigation_of_the_Relationship_between_Self-Efficacy_Beliefs_about_Technology_Integration_and_Technological_Pedagogical_Content_Knowledge_TPACK_among_Preservice_Teachers","228322127_Management_as_Visionary_Planning_for_Dealing_with_Systemic_Change_A_Case_of_Malaysian_Open_Distance_Learning_Institution","220140408_Revisiting_technological_pedagogical_content_knowledge_Exploring_the_TPACK_framework","290623883_TPACKing_A_constructivist_framing_of_TPACK_to_analyze_teachers'_construction_of_knowledge","289875115_Beginning_teacher_knowledge_Results_from_a_self-assessed_TPACK_survey","289873772_The_Mathematics_and_Science_Integration_Argument_A_Stand_for_Teacher_Education","287625658_Demographic_Factors_TPACK_Constructs_and_Teachers'_Perceptions_of_Constructivist-Oriented_TPACK","286280991_Surveying_in-service_preschool_teachers'_technological_pedagogical_content_knowledge","285650870_From_socialisation_to_internalisation_Cultivating_technological_pedagogical_content_knowledge_through_problem-based_learning","285416174_Leading_Change_and_Innovation_in_Teacher_Preparation_A_Blueprint_for_Developing_TPACK_Ready_Teacher_Candidates","285241714_Breaking_news_TPCK_becomes_TPACK","282102314_Advancing_K-8_teachers'_STEM_education_for_teaching_interdisciplinary_science_and_mathematics_with_technologies","279240832_Assessing_Teacher's_Integration_of_Technology_and_Literacy_in_Elementary_Science_Classrooms_in_Kuwait","257171180_Exploring_the_TPACK_of_Taiwanese_elementary_mathematics_and_science_teachers_with_respect_to_use_of_interactive_whiteboards","254860459_Developing_pre-service_teacher_competencies_for_ICT_integration_through_design_teams","253523853_Mathematics_Teachers'_Development_Exploration_and_Advancement_of_Technological_Pedagogical_Content_Knowledge_in_the_Teaching_and_Learning_of_Algebra","230057724_Mathematics_and_Science_Integration_Models_and_Characterizations","225430853_From_PCK_to_TPACK_Developing_a_transformative_model_for_pre-service_science_teachers","222543716_Tracing_the_development_of_teacher_knowledge_in_a_design_seminar_Integrating_content_pedagogy_and_technology","220677541_Internet_use_by_the_faculty_members_of_Kuwait_University","220140854_Modeling_primary_school_pre-service_teachers'_Technological_Pedagogical_Content_Knowledge_TPACK_for_meaningful_learning_with_information_and_communication_technology_ICT","220041541_Technological_Pedagogical_Content_Knowledge_A_Framework_for_Teacher_Knowledge","200773379_Educational_applications_of_Web_20_Using_blogs_to_support_teaching_and_learning_Original_Articles"]}
