{"id":"243780198_A_spanning_tree_expansion_of_the_Jones_polynomial","abstract":"A NEW combinatorial formulation of the Jones polynomial of a link is used to establish some basic properties of this polynomial. A striking consequence of these properties is the result that a link admitting an alternating diagram with m crossings and with no “nugatory” crossing cannot be projected with fewer than m crossings.","authors":["Morwen B.
