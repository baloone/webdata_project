{"id":"273025373_Beyond_L1-L2_Equivalents_Where_do_Users_of_English_as_a_Foreign_Language_Turn_for_Help","abstract":"Current research shows that learners use dictionaries mainly to look up meanings, and generally prefer bilingual over monolingual\nlook-ups. Despite the remarkable advances that have taken place in pedagogical lexicography over the past decades, many features\nof learnersâ€™ dictionaries remain underexploited. Based on the premise that these dictionaries tend to be underused primarily\nbecause learners are insufficiently aware of their reference needs, this exploratory study examines what resources a group\nof 211 non-native speakers of English would choose to use when confronted with the demand to look up other types of linguistic\ninformation, beyond L1-L2 equivalents. The results suggest that reference preferences can change dramatically under these\ncircumstances (the bilingual dictionary no longer being a favourite), and that learners do not know where to look up much\nof the information they need.","authors":["Ana Frankenberg-Garcia"],"meta":["February 2011International Journal of Lexicography 24(1):97-123","DOI:10.1093/ijl/ecq038"],"references":["255641788_Providing_student_writers_with_pre-text_feedback","233559868_Oxford_Collocations_Dictionary_for_Students_of_English","350227496_Translators_and_their_Use_of_Dictionaries_User_Needs_and_User_Habits","274164137_Monitoring_Dictionary_Use","273880920_Dictionary_use_in_production","249239229_Sven_Tarp_Lexicography_in_the_Borderland_between_Knowledge_and_Non-Knowledge_General_Lexicographical_Theory_with_Particular_Focus_on_Learner's_Lexicography","243766321_The_role_of_dictionaries_in_language_learning","240581221_Paper_or_Electronic_The_Role_of_Dictionary_Form_in_Language_Reception_Production_and_the_Retention_of_Meaning_and_Collocations","238337548_The_BBI_Dictionary_of_English_Word_Combinations","232818611_Productive_dictionary_skills_training_What_do_language_learners_find_useful"]}
