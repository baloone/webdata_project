The features of the implementation of decisions are analyzed and the requirements to the decision support system are formulated. A stratified scheme of constructing a decision support system model is proposed, which makes it possible to simplify the formalization of the decision-making process. The process of modeling the context in the decision making process is considered. The article presents a formal representation of contextual models for business operations of the employment sector. The Context Graphic Model has been improved to address the problem of analyzing the context of business operations.","authors":["Iryna Zavushchak","Iryna Shvorob","Zoriana Rybchak"],"meta":["January 2019","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-01069-0_18","Project: Methods and means of constructing context-dependent intellectual systems in the field of employment"],"references":["323750629_Methods_of_Processing_Context_in_Intelligent_Systems","322066169_The_Context_of_Operations_as_the_basis_for_the_Construction_of_Ontologies_of_Employment_Processes","305293372_Models_of_context-aware_decision_support_systems_in_dynamic_structured_domains","286454057_The_method_for_detecting_plagiarism_in_a_collection_of_documents","324605955_Association_rules_mining_in_big_data","316904426_The_personalized_approach_in_a_medical_decentralized_diagnostic_and_treatment","309148977_Features_of_e-learning_realization_using_virtual_research_laboratory","299139652_The_Intelligent_Enterprise_A_New_Paradigm","286911202_Fast_and_Efficient_Context-Aware_Services","223160974_Comparison_of_Bayesian_and_Regression_Approaches_to_the_Study_of_Information_Processing_Judgment","221032220_Task-Realization_Models_in_Contextual_Graphs","220141486_Understanding_and_Using_Context","222425672_Ontology-based_situation_awareness","220254425_Ontology-based_models_in_pervasive_computing_systems","220251055_There_is_more_to_context_than_location"]}
