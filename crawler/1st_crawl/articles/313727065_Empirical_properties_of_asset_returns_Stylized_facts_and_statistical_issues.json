{"id":"313727065_Empirical_properties_of_asset_returns_Stylized_facts_and_statistical_issues","abstract":"We present a set of stylized empirical facts emerging from the statistical analysis of price variations in various types of financial markets. We first discuss some general issues common to all statistical studies of financial time series. Various statistical properties of asset returns are then described: distributional properties, tail properties and extreme fluctuations, pathwise regularity, linear and nonlinear dependence of returns in time and across stocks. Our description emphasizes properties common to a wide variety of markets and instruments. We then show how these statistical properties invalidate many of the common statistical approaches used to study financial data sets and examine some of the statistical problems encountered in each case.","authors":["Rama Cont"],"meta":["January 2001Quantitative Finance 1(2):223-236","DOI:10.1080/713665670"],"references":["318773987_Multivariate_extremes_aggregation_and_risk_estimation","317249552_The_Limiting_Extremal_Behaviour_of_Speculative_Returns_An_Analysis_of_Intra-Daily_Data_From_the_Frankfurt_Stock_Exchange","313652689_Normal_inverse_Gaussian_processes_and_the_modelling_of_stock_returns","313175150_A_subordinated_stochastic_model_with_finite_variance_for_speculative_prices","312727770_Fractional_Brownian_motion_fractional_noises_and_applications","302430310_The_Variation_of_Certain_Speculative_Prices_Jour","279618735_Limit_theory_for_the_sample_autocorrelations_and_extremes_of_a_GARCH_1_1_process","278890081_Heteroskedasticity_in_Stock_Return_Data_Volume_versus_GARCH_Effects","267038136_The_multifractal_formalism_revisited_with_wavelets","266351941_A_non-random_walk_down_Wall_Street"]}
