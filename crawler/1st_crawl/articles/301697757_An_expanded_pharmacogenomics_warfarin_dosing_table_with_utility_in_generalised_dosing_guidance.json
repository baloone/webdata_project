{"id":"301697757_An_expanded_pharmacogenomics_warfarin_dosing_table_with_utility_in_generalised_dosing_guidance","abstract":"Pharmacogenomics (PGx) guided warfarin dosing, using a comprehensive dosing algorithm, is expected to improve dose optimisation and lower the risk of adverse drug reactions. As a complementary tool, a simple genotype-dosing table, such as in the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Coumadin drug label, may be utilised for general risk assessment of likely over- or under-anticoagulation on a standard dose of warfarin. This tool may be used as part of the clinical decision support for the interpretation of genetic data, serving as a first step in the anticoagulation therapy decision making process. Here we used a publicly available warfarin dosing calculator (www.warfarindosing.org) to create an expanded gene-based warfarin dosing table, the CPMC-WD table that includes nine genetic variants in CYP2C9, VKORC1, and CYP4F2. Using two datasets, a European American cohort (EUA, n=73) and the Quebec Warfarin Cohort (QWC, n=769), we show that the CPMC-WD table more accurately predicts therapeutic dose than the FDA table (51 % vs 33 %, respectively, in the EUA, McNemar’s two-sided p=0.02; 52 % vs 37 % in the QWC, p<1×10−6). It also outperforms both the standard of care 5 mg/day dosing (51 % vs 34 % in the EUA, p=0.04; 52 % vs 31 % in the QWC, p<1×10−6) as well as a clinical-only algorithm (51 % vs 38 % in the EUA, trend p=0.11; 52 % vs 45 % in the QWC, p=0.003). This table offers a valuable update to the PGx dosing guideline in the drug label.\nSupplementary Material to this article is available at www.thrombosis-online.com.","authors":["Payman Shahabi","Laura B Scheinfeldt","Daniel Lynch","Tara Schmidlen"],"meta":["April 2016Thrombosis and Haemostasis 116(2)","DOI:10.1160/TH15-12-0955","Project: Personalized Medicine study"],"references":["283020725_Why_admixture_matters_in_genetically-guided_therapy_Missed_targets_in_the_COAG_and_EU-PACT_trials","281451334_Using_the_Coriell_Personalized_Medicine_Collaborative_Data_to_conduct_a_genome-wide_association_study_of_sleep_duration","281343779_Genetic_Knowledge_Among_Participants_in_the_Coriell_Personalized_Medicine_Collaborative","328152448_ACCAHAESC_Guidelines_for_the_Management_of_Patients_With_Atrial_Fibrillation_Executive_Summary_A_Report_of_the_American_College_of_CardiologyAmerican_Heart_Association_Task_Force_on_Practice_Guideline","313060950_Emergency_Hospitalization_for_Adverse_Drug_Events_in_Older_Americans","296762819_Emergency_Hospitalizations_for_Adverse_Drug_Events_REPLY","293300547_The_largest_prospective_warfarin-treated_cohort_supports_genetic_forecasting_Blood_2009_113_4_784-792","279989482_Genotype-guided_versus_standard_vitamin_K_antagonist_dosing_algorithms_in_patients_initiating_anticoagulation_A_systematic_review_and_meta-analysis","279428753_ACCAHAESC_Guidelines_for_the_Management_of_Patients_with_Atrial_Fibrillation-Executive_Summary","278883467_OPTIMAL_ORAL_ANTICOAGULANT-THERAPY_IN_PATIENTS_WITH_NONRHEUMATIC_ATRIAL-FIBRILLATION_AND_RECENT_CEREBRAL-ISCHEMIA"]}
