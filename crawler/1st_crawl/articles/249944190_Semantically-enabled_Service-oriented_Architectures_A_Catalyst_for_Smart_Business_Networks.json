{"id":"249944190_Semantically-enabled_Service-oriented_Architectures_A_Catalyst_for_Smart_Business_Networks","abstract":"Smart Business Networks are two things: Firstly, an emerging concept for the agile composition of e-business value chains, and secondly a new stream of research. While there exists a coherent vision of Smart Business Networks and the associated functionality, there is insufficient understanding of why creating and maintaining such infrastructure and networks is as difficult as being experienced in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we (1) trace back the complexity of partner selection, process composition, and execution monitoring to the lack of semantics in the description of system elements in SBN environment, (2) propose a semantically- enabled service-oriented architecture (SESA) as a the foundational layer for future Smart Business Networks, and (3) show how our approach significantly reduces the complexity of the core network management tasks by lifting them to a higher level of abstraction.","authors":["H.
