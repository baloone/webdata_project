{"id":"326705757_Multidiscipline_Integrated_Platform_Based_on_Probabilistic_Analysis_for_Manufacturing_Engineering_Processes","abstract":"Researchers from different disciplines, such as materials science, computer science, safety science, mechanical engineering and controlling engineering, have aimed to improve the quality of manufacturing engineering processes. Considering the requirements of research and development of advanced materials, reliable manufacturing and collaborative innovation, a multidiscipline integrated platform framework based on probabilistic analysis for manufacturing engineering processes is proposed. The proposed platform consists of three logical layers: The requirement layer, the database layer and the application layer. The platform is intended to be a scalable system to gradually supplement related data, models and approaches. The main key technologies of the platform, encapsulation methods, information fusion approaches and the collaborative mechanism are also discussed. The proposed platform will also be gradually improved in the future. In order to exchange information for manufacturing engineering processes, scientists and engineers of different institutes of materials science and manufacturing engineering should strengthen their cooperation.","authors":["Lijun Zhang","Kai Liu","Jian Liu"],"meta":["July 2018Future Internet 10(8):70","DOI:10.3390/fi10080070"],"references":["323501114_How_Data_Will_Transform_Industrial_Processes_Crowdsensing_Crowdsourcing_and_Big_Data_as_Pillars_of_Industry_40","318074423_Industrial_Process_Monitoring_in_the_Big_DataIndustry_40_Era_from_Detection_to_Diagnosis_to_Prognosis","315328118_Digital_twin-driven_product_design_manufacturing_and_service_with_big_data","305076985_Process_Materials_Scientific_Data_for_Intelligent_Service_Using_a_Dataspace_Model","322863797_Force_and_temperature_modelling_of_bone_milling_using_artificial_neural_networks","320732848_MAQUINAS_MULTITAREA_EVOLUCION_RECURSOS_PROCESOS_Y_PROGRAMACION","318430955_Smart_manufacturing","316533546_Quantitative_and_Localization_Diagnosis_of_a_Defective_Ball_Bearing_Based_on_Vertical-Horizontal_Synchronization_Signal_Analysis","313494715_OMICC_an_overlay_multicast_infrastructure_based_on_cloud_computing_for_streaming_media_data_distribution","308182610_Multidisciplinary_design_optimization_architecture_to_concurrent_design_of_satellite_systems"]}
