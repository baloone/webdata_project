{"id":"222443641_Gras_a_graph-oriented_software_engineering_database_system","abstract":"Modern software systems for application areas such as software engineering, CAD, or office automation are usually highly interactive and deal with rather complex object structures. For the realization of these systems a nonstandard database system is needed which is able to efficiently handle different types of coarse- and fine-grained objects (like documents and paragraphs), hierarchical and non-hierarchical relations between objects (like composition-links and cross-references), and finally attributes of rather different size (like chapter numbers and bitmaps). Furthermore, this database system should support incremental computation of derived data, undo/redo of data modifications, error recovery from system crashes, and version control mechanisms. In this paper, we describe the underlying data model and the functionality of GRAS, a database system which has been designed according to the requirements mentioned above. Furthermore, we motivate our central design decisions concerning its realization, and report on experiences and applications.","authors":["Norbert Kiesel","Andy Sch√ºrr","Bernhard Westfechtel"],"meta":["March 1995Information Systems 20(1):21-51","DOI:10.1016/0306-4379(95)00002-L"],"references":["265793679_Caddy_Computer-aided_design_of_non-standard_databases","265003346_A_Layered_Approach_to_Software_Design","228803092_Implementation_of_the_imperativerule_based_language_PROGRES","228544316_A_heuristic_for_the_subgraph_isomorphism_problem_in_executing_PROGRES","221321694_Intermedia_A_Case_Study_of_the_Differences_Between_Relational_and_Object-Oriented_Database_Systems","221310070_Linear_Hashing_with_Partial_Expansions","221215060_A_Graph-Oriented_Object_Model_for_Database_End-User_Interfaces","313197876_The_HiPAC_Project_Combining_Active_Databases_and_Timing_Constraints","305257856_Fast_Search_in_Main_Memory_Databases","281430706_Managing_software_processes_in_the_environment_MELMAC","264212636_RCS-A_system_for_version_control","262284449_The_Architecture_Of_An_Active_Database_Management_System","262249583_The_HyperModel_benchmark","260648832_The_Source_Code_Control_System","250719711_ECMA-the_European_computer_manufacturers_association","243771485_FYI_On_the_X_Window_System","243764649_Characterization_of_the_ipsen_project","243510530_Gandalf_software_development_environments","242463515_Organization_and_maintenance_of_large_ordered_indices","242437745_Incremental_evaluation_of_attribute_graphs","242401705_GRAS_A_non-standard_database_system_within_a_software_development_environment","238712462_H_r_strong_extendible_hashing_a_fast_access_method_for_dynamic_fries","234799978_Building_integrated_software_development_environments_Part_I_tool_specification","234789158_The_architecture_of_an_active_database_management_system","225526748_A_Storage_manager_for_the_Hypernode_model","222447212_Access_support_relations_An_indexing_method_for_object_bases","221556101_Database_System_Support_for_Software_Engineering","221553686_Concepts_and_Implementation_of_a_Rule-Based_Process_Engine","221331482_DAMOKLES_-_A_Database_System_for_Software_ENgineering_Environments","221311200_A_Study_of_Three_Alternative_Workstation-Server_Architectures_for_Object-Oriented_Database_Systems","221311016_Virtual_Hashing_A_Dynamically_Changing_Hashing","221310699_A_Study_of_Index_Structures_for_Main_Memory_Database_Management_Systems","221310691_The_Enity-Relationship_Model_Toward_a_Unified_View_of_Data","221309937_A_Model_for_Active_Object_Oriented_Databases","221236463_The_Synthesizer_Generator","221236440_Version_Management_in_Gypsy","221214727_Modified_Dynamic_Hashing","221214223_Event_Specification_in_an_Active_Object-Oriented_Database","221213907_Hy_A_Hygraph-based_Query_and_Visualization_System","221213621_Fast_Search_in_Main_Memory_Databases","221212962_The_O2_Object-Oriented_Database_System","221212719_Neptune_a_Hypertext_System_for_CAD_Applications","221149376_GRAS_A_Management_System_for_Graph-Like_Documents","221103442_The_HyperModel_Benchmark","221025743_Logic_Based_Structure_Rewriting_Systems","220997281_Type''_Is_Not_A_Type","220960150_Revision_Control_in_an_Integrated_Software_Development_Environment","220960135_Delta_Storage_for_Arbitrary_Non-Text_Files","220862891_A_Storage_Manager_for_the_Hypernode_Model","220713260_Progress_A_VHL-language_based_on_graph_grammars","220566182_Dynamic_Hashing_Schemes","220515526_Telos_Representing_Knowledge_About_Information_Systems","220713132_A_Specification_Environment_for_Graph_Grammars","220423842_The_ObjectStore_Database_System","220420082_The_Gemstone_Object_Database_Management_System"]}
