{"id":"328622892_Node_centrality_analysis_of_multiplex_networks_under_Computer_virus_spreading","abstract":"Computer virus is evolving by developing spreading mechanisms based on the use of multiple vectors of propagation. Finding important nodes in the network and taking action can effectively control the range and speed of the computer virus. Most of the current research on the influential spreaders is on the single-layer network level. However, compared with single-layer network, the influential spreaders of multiplex networks will be more realistic. In particular, we design the propagation of a susceptible-infected-susceptible (sis) model on multiplex networks (not only double-layers networks) where the state of each node is layer-interconnected and the dynamics in each network follows either a contact process or a reactive process, with different propagation rates. Here we show that node evaluation indicators of single-layer network (such as degree centrality, eigenvector centrality, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality and so on) are still applicable in the multiplex networks.","authors":["Yuang Wang","Hongfu Liu","Baoan Ren","Jing Chen"],"meta":["August 2018","DOI:10.1145/3265639.3265682","Conference: the 3rd International Conference"],"references":["318222655_Optimal_percolation_on_multiplex_networks","279633303_Influence_maximization_in_complex_networks_through_optimal_percolation","275359239_Ranking_in_interconnected_multilayer_networks_reveals_versatile_nodes","262525952_Epidemic_spreading_and_risk_perception_in_multiplex_networks_A_self-organized_percolation_method","257866651_An_epidemic_model_of_rumor_diffusion_in_online_social_networks","257347892_Eigenvector_centrality_of_nodes_in_multiplex_networks","253942636_Networks_formed_by_interdependent_networks","249995417_Mathematical_Formulation_of_Multi-Layer_Networks","45898153_Identification_of_influential_spreaders_in_complex_networks","307564016_Articulation_Points_in_Complex_Networks","260132483_Multiple_routes_transmitted_epidemics_on_multiplex_networks","260008499_SIRaRu_rumor_spreading_model_in_complex_networks","259478068_Multiple_routes_transmitted_epidemics_on_multiplex_networks","257299296_Vulnerability_of_multi-layer_networks_under_malware_spreading","226603227_On_the_mathematical_theory_of_rumor_spread","220116494_Tensor_Decompositions_and_Applications","46422830_Model_for_rumor_spreading_over_networks"]}
