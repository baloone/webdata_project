{"id":"282595905_Business_Process_Model_and_Notation_BPMN","abstract":"This chapter is intended to provide an overview and introduction to the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN). We will describe BPMN and its historic development. In addition, we will provide the general context and usage of BPMN, layered upon the technical details defined in the BPMN 2.0 Specification. The basics of the BPMN notation will be describedâ€”that is, the types of graphical shapes, their purpose, and how they work together as part of a Business Process Model/Diagram. Also discussed will be the different uses of BPMN diagram types, including how levels of precision affect what a modeler will include in a diagram. Finally, the value in using BPMN as a standard notation will be defined.","authors":["Mark von Rosing","Stephen White","Fred Cummins","Henk de Man"],"meta":["March 2015","DOI:10.1016/B978-0-12-799959-3.00021-5","In book: The Complete Business Process Handbook, Volume 1 (pp.429-453)Publisher: Elsevier - Morgan Kaufmann"],"references":["24285157_An_XML_Representation_for_Crew_Procedures","235949991_Business_Process_Modeling_Notation_BPML_Version_10"]}
