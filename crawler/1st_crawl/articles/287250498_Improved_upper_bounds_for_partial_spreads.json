{"id":"287250498_Improved_upper_bounds_for_partial_spreads","abstract":"A partial (Formula presented.)-spread in (Formula presented.) is a collection of (Formula presented.)-dimensional subspaces with trivial intersection. So far, the maximum size of a partial (Formula presented.)-spread in (Formula presented.) was known for the cases (Formula presented.), (Formula presented.), and (Formula presented.) with the additional requirements (Formula presented.) and (Formula presented.).
