{"id":"264085237_Multiple_Depot_Ring_Star_Problem_A_polyhedral_study_and_exact_algorithm","abstract":"The Multiple Depot Ring-Star Problem (MDRSP) is an important combinatorial\noptimization problem arising in the context of optical fiber network design,\nresource allocation in monitoring applications, to name a few. In particular,\ngiven a set of depots and a set of customers, it consists of designing a set of\nsimple cycles (rings), each of which passes through exactly one depot and\nthrough some customers, and then assigning each non-visited customer to a depot\nor a visited customer in some ring. The objective is to minimize the sum of the\ntotal routing costs and total assignment costs. In this paper, we present a\nmixed integer linear programming formulation for the MDRSP and propose valid\ninequalities to strengthen the linear programming relaxation. Furthermore, we\ndo a complete polyhedral analysis and derive facet-inducing results for the\nMDRSP. All these results are then used to develop a branch-and-cut algorithm to\nobtain optimal solutions to the MDRSP. The performance of the branch-and-cut\nalgorithm is evaluated through extensive computational experiments on a several\nclasses of test instances.","authors":["Kaarthik Sundar","Sivakumar Rathinam"],"meta":["March 2017Journal of Global Optimization 67(3)","DOI:10.1007/s10898-016-0431-7","SourcearXiv"],"references":["297677409_An_equi-model_matheuristic_for_the_multi-depot_ring_star_problem","280912526_Generalized_multiple_depot_traveling_salesmen_problem_-_Polyhedral_study_and_exact_algorithm","268645053_The_Traveling_Salesman_Problem_A_Computational_Study","268636341_Path_Tree_and_Cycle_Location","260635373_Bridging_Cooperative_Sensing_and_Route_Planning_of_Autonomous_Vehicles","260607780_A_Comparison_of_Several_Models_for_the_Hamiltonian_p-Median_Problem","257516230_Multi-depot_Multiple_TSP_A_polyhedral_study_and_computational_results","248656173_TSPLIB-A_traveling_salesman_problem_library","242379744_Odd_Minimum_Cut-Sets_and_b-Matchings","239744603_A_branch_and_cut_algorithm_for_the_Steiner_ring_star_Problem","233842272_A_Branch-and-Cut_Algorithm_for_the_Symmetric_Generalized_Traveling_Salesman_Problem","228640933_The_Capacitated_m_-Ring-Star_Problem","233843451_The_Vehicle_Routing_Problem","232393191_A_Branch-and-Cut_method_for_the_Capacitated_Location-Routing_Problem","228811518_An_Exact_Algorithm_for_Solving_the_Ring_Star_Problem"]}
