{"id":"277603448_Packing_Counting_and_Covering_Hamilton_cycles_in_random_directed_graphs","abstract":"A Hamilton cycle in a digraph is a cycle passes through all the vertices,\nwhere all the arcs are oriented in the same direction. The problem of finding\nHamilton cycles in directed graphs is well studied and is known to be hard. One\nof the main reasons for this, is that there is no general tool for finding\nHamilton cycles in directed graphs comparable to the so called Pos\\'a\n'rotation-extension' technique for the undirected analogue. Let ${\\mathcal\nD}(n,p)$ denote the random digraph on vertex set $[n]$, obtained by adding each\ndirected edge independently with probability $p$. Here, we present a general\nand a very simple method, using known results, to attack problems of packing\nand counting Hamilton cycles in random directed graphs, for every\nedge-probability $p>\\log^C(n)/n$. Our results are asymptotically optimal with\nrespect to all parameters and apply equally well to the undirected case.","authors":["Asaf Ferber","Gal Kronenberg","Eoin Long"],"meta":["June 2015Electronic Notes in Discrete Mathematics 49","DOI:10.1016/j.endm.2015.06.109","SourcearXiv"],"references":["266677330_Packing_a_randomly_edge-colored_random_graph_with_rainbow_k-outs","305876300_Proof_of_the_1-factorization_and_Hamilton_Decomposition_Conjectures","303488211_For_how_many_edges_is_a_digraph_almost_certainly_hamiltonian","288633293_Counting_Hamilton_cycles_in_random_directed_graphs","288274038_Kombinatorikai_vizsgalatok_az_iranyitott_teljes_graffal","268496537_Random_Graphs","267089635_Hamiltonian_lines_in_graphs_whose_vertices_have_sufficiently_large_valencies","266755883_The_Evolution_of_Random_Graphs","266677172_Robust_Hamiltonicity_of_random_directed_graphs","266521243_Hamilton_Circuits_in_Regular_Tournaments"]}
