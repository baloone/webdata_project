{"id":"249645479_Polynomial_time_approximation_schemes_for_the_traveling_repairman_and_other_minimum_latency_problems","abstract":"We give a polynomial time, $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for the\ntraveling repairman problem (TRP) in the Euclidean plane, on weighted planar\ngraphs, and on weighted trees. This improves on the known quasi-polynomial time\napproximation schemes for these problems. The algorithm is based on a simple\ntechnique that reduces the TRP to what we call the \\emph{segmented TSP}. Here,\nwe are given numbers $l_1,\\dots,l_K$ and $n_1,\\dots,n_K$ and we need to find a\npath that visits at least $n_h$ points within path distance $l_h$ from the\nstarting point for all $h\\in\\{1,\\dots,K\\}$. A solution is $\\alpha$-approximate\nif at least $n_h$ points are visited within distance $\\alpha l_h$. It is shown\nthat any algorithm that is $\\alpha$-approximate for \\emph{every constant} K in\nsome metric space, gives an $\\alpha(1+\\epsilon)$-approximation for the TRP in\nthe same metric space. Subsequently, approximation schemes are given for this\nsegmented TSP problem in different metric spaces.The segmented TSP with only\none segment (K=1) is equivalent to the k-TSP for which a\n$(2+\\epsilon)$-approximation is known for a general metric space. Hence, this\napproach through the segmented TSP gives new impulse for improving on the\n3.59-approximation for TRP in a general metric space. A similar reduction\napplies to many other minimum latency problems. To illustrate the strength of\nthis approach we apply it to the well-studied scheduling problem of minimizing\ntotal weighted completion time under precedence constraints, $1|prec|\\sum\nw_{j}C_{j}$, and present a polynomial time approximation scheme for the case of\ninterval order precedence constraints. This improves on the known\n3/2-approximation for this problem. Both approximation schemes apply as well if\nrelease dates are added to the problem.","authors":["Ren√© Sitters"],"meta":["July 2013","DOI:10.1137/1.9781611973402.46","SourcearXiv"],"references":["228057537_A_Polynomial-Time_Approximation_Scheme_for_Weighted_Planar_Graph_TSP","227630950_Special_cases_of_traveling_salesman_and_repairman_problems_with_time_Windows","2317809_Approximation_Schemes_for_Minimum_Latency_Problems","265460056_Sequencing_Jobs_to_Minimize_Total_Weighted_Completion_Time_Subject_to_Precedence_Ordering_and_Linear_Delay_Penalties","260302610_On_the_Approximability_of_Single-Machine_Scheduling_with_Precedence_Constraints","254761198_Erratum_to_news_from_the_online_traveling_repairman","242416253_Decomposition_Algorithms_for_Single-Machine_Sequencing_with_Precedence_Relations_and_Deferral_Costs","232634249_Polynomial_time_approximation_schemes_for_Euclidean_TSP_and_other_geometric_problems","232625483_Paths_Trees_and_Minimum_Latency_Tours","230596056_Sequencing_jobs_to_minimize_total_weighted_completion_time_subject_to_precedence_constraints","230596033_Complexity_of_Scheduling_Under_Precedence_Constraints","230595985_Optimization_and_Approximation_in_Deterministic_Sequencing_and_Scheduling_A_Survey","228057587_Approximation_Schemes_for_Minimizing_Average_Weighted_Completion_Time_with_Release_Dates","225690366_News_from_the_Online_Traveling_Repairman","225499779_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Minimizing_Average_Distortion","225467960_On_the_Approximability_of_Average_Completion_Time_Scheduling_under_Precedence_Constraints","225174976_Approximation_schemes_for_NP-hard_geometric_optimization_problems_A_survey","221590244_Minimum_latency_problem","221462511_The_Directed_Minimum_Latency_Problem","221317001_The_Minimum_Latency_Problem_Is_NP-Hard_for_Weighted_Trees","220994451_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Minimizing_Average_Distortion","220898264_Searching_a_Fixed_Graph","220825772_Heuristics_for_the_Traveling_Repairman_Problem_with_Profits","220780465_Improved_Approximation_Algorithms_for_the_Minimum_Latency_Problem_via_Prize-Collecting_Strolls","220208938_A_Note_on_the_Traveling_Repairman_Problem","220165504_The_Complexity_of_the_Travelling_Repairman_Problem","216877580_Geometric_Algorithms_and_Combinatorial_Optimization","2926896_The_k-Traveling_Repairman_Problem","2540710_Faster_Approximation_Algorithms_for_the_Minimum_Latency_Problem","2306007_An_Improved_Approximation_Ratio_for_the_Minimum_Latency_Problem"]}
