{"id":"23571587_Restricting_Snacks_in_US_Elementary_Schools_Is_Associated_with_Higher_Frequency_of_Fruit_and_Vegetable_Consumption","abstract":"Efforts are needed to improve U.S. children's poor diet quality. Our purpose was to examine whether a policy that restricts the availability of snack foods in the schools is associated with greater fruit and vegetable consumption in a nationally representative sample of 5th grade children. Children in schools with restricted snack availability had significantly higher frequency of fruit and vegetable consumption than children in schools without restricted snack availability. Our findings suggest that a restrictive snack policy should be part of a multi-faceted approach to improve children's diet quality.","authors":["Wendy Gonzalez","Sonya J Jones","Edward A Frongillo"],"meta":["January 2009Journal of Nutrition 139(1):142-4","DOI:10.3945/jn.108.099531","SourcePubMed"],"references":["279412261_Fruit_and_Vegetable_Intakes_of_Children_and_Adolescents_in_the_United_States","15532141_What_Are_American_Children_Eating_Implications_for_Public_Policy","15084596_Measuring_Fruit_and_Vegetable_Preferences_Among_4th-_and_5th-Grade_Students","14658519_Fruit_and_Vegetable_Intakes_of_Children_and_Adolescents_in_the_United_States","14041621_Patterns_in_Children's_Fruit_and_Vegetable_Consumption_by_Meal_and_Day_of_the_Week","13937630_Food_Intakes_of_US_Children_and_Adolescents_Compared_With_Recommendations","13091668_Soft_Drink_Consumption_Among_US_Children_and_Adolescents","12597292_Fat_and_Sugar_Levels_are_High_in_Snacks_Purchased_From_Student_Stores_in_Middle_Schools","12402438_Sandeno_C_Wolf_G_Drake_T_Reicks_M_Behavioral_strategies_to_increase_fruit_and_vegetable_intake_by_fourth-_through_sixth-grade_students_J_Am_Diet_Assoc_100_828-830","12191650_Effect_of_a_La_Carte_and_Snack_Bar_Foods_at_School_on_Children's_Lunchtime_Intake_of_Fruits_and_Vegetables","10683699_The_Association_of_the_School_Food_Environment_With_Dietary_Behaviors_of_Young_Adolescents","10719763_Fostering_Healthy_Food_Consumption_in_Schools_Focusing_on_the_Challenges_of_Competitive_Foods","9036151_Availability_Accessibility_and_Preferences_for_Fruit_100_Fruit_Juice_and_Vegetables_Influence_Children's_Dietary_Behavior","6925452_Systematic_review_of_environmental_correlates_of_obesity-related_dietary_behaviors_in_youth"]}
