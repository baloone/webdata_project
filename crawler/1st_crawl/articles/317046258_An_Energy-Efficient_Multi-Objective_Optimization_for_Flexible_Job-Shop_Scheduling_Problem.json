{"id":"317046258_An_Energy-Efficient_Multi-Objective_Optimization_for_Flexible_Job-Shop_Scheduling_Problem","abstract":"In recent years there has been increased concern on energy efficiency of industries. Since the scheduling problems in the shop floors are directly related to the energy consumption, an appropriate way to improve energy efficiency in industrial plants is to develop effective scheduling strategies. Hence, the aim of this paper is to design an energy-efficient scheduling in a shop floor industrial environment, i.e., flexible job-shop scheduling problem (FJSP). To this end, a multi-objective optimization model is developed with three objective functions: (i) minimizing total completion time, (ii) maximizing the total availability of the system, and (iii) minimizing total energy cost of both production and maintenance operations in the FJSP. To cope with this multi-objective optimization problem, an enhanced evolutionary algorithm incorporated with the global criterion, as a multi-objective handling technique, is proposed and then performance evaluation is performed based on an extensive numerical analysis.","authors":["Hadi Mokhtari","Aliakbar Hasani"],"meta":["May 2017Computers & Chemical Engineering 104","DOI:10.1016/j.compchemeng.2017.05.004"],"references":["304344789_An_exact_extended_formulation_for_the_unrelated_parallel_machine_total_weighted_completion_time_problem","284142035_Particle_swarm_optimization_algorithm_embedded_with_maximum_deviation_theory_for_solving_multi-objective_flexible_job_shop_scheduling_problem","273536307_Energy_Efficiency_of_Manufacturing_Processes_A_Critical_Review","258242210_Toward_Energy_Efficient_Manufacturing_A_Study_on_Practices_and_Viewpoint_of_the_Industry","239795495_Production_scheduling_with_outsourcing_scenarios_A_mixed_integer_programming_and_efficient_solution_procedure","233283574_Operational_methods_for_minimization_of_energy_consumption_of_manufacturing_equipment","224085735_A_Multiple_Objective_Optimization_Model_for_Environmental_Benign_Process_Planning","312401116_A_metaheuristic_technique_for_energy-efficiency_in_job-shop_scheduling","301797994_Bi-objective_optimization_for_integrating_production_and_preventive_maintenance_scheduling_in_two-stage_assembly_flow_shop_problem","300411440_Minimizing_tardiness_and_maintenance_costs_in_flow_shop_scheduling_by_a_lower-bound-based_GA","299460636_A_multi_objective_optimization_approach_for_flexible_job_shop_scheduling_problem_under_random_machine_breakdown_by_evolutionary_algorithms","291421524_Robust_global_supply_chain_network_design_under_disruption_and_uncertainty_considering_resilience_strategies_A_parallel_memetic_algorithm_for_a_real-life_case_study","284212859_Multi-objective_optimization_of_integrated_lot-sizing_and_scheduling_problem_in_flexible_job_shops","283310599_Simulation_Modelling_of_Energy_Dynamics_in_Discrete_Manufacturing_Systems","283023542_Effective_Ensembles_of_Heuristics_for_Scheduling_Flexible_Job_Shop_Problem_with_New_Job_Insertion","281325668_Machine_scheduling_with_deteriorating_and_resource-dependent_maintenance_activity","276548863_Carbon-efficient_scheduling_of_flow_shops_by_multi-objective_optimization","276309656_Robust_closed-loop_global_supply_chain_network_design_under_uncertainty_The_case_of_the_medical_device_industry","273397667_Magnetic_Material_Group_Furnace_Problem_Modeling_and_the_Specialization_of_the_Genetic_Algorithm","272811038_Methods_for_Integrating_Energy_Consumption_and_Environmental_Impact_Considerations_into_the_Production_Operation_of_Machining_Processes","271625503_A_particle_swarm_model_for_estimating_reliability_and_scheduling_system_maintenance","267621546_Energy_Consumption_Reduction_for_Sustainable_Manufacturing_Systems_Considering_Machines_With_Multiple-Power_States","263728520_Reduction_of_power_consumption_and_carbon_footprints_by_applying_multi-objective_optimisation_via_genetic_algorithms","260621081_Single-Machine_Sustainable_Production_Planning_to_Minimize_Total_Energy_Consumption_and_Total_Completion_Time_Using_a_Multiple_Objective_Genetic_Algorithm","260002162_Energy-aware_scheduling_for_improving_manufacturing_process_sustainability_A_mathematical_model_for_flexible_flow_shops","257408698_An_on-line_approach_for_energy_efficiency_monitoring_of_machine_tools","257242647_Energy-efficient_scheduling_for_a_flexible_flow_shop_using_an_improved_genetic-simulated_annealing_algorithm","257153724_Scheduling_with_an_outsourcing_option_on_both_manufacturer_and_subcontractors","253342322_Hybrid_Evolutionary_Algorithm_for_job_scheduling_under_machine_maintenance","245494762_A_framework_to_minimise_total_energy_consumption_and_total_tardiness_on_a_single_machine","238000620_A_new_approach_to_scheduling_in_manufacturing_for_power_consumption_and_carbon_footprint_reduction","226974218_Flexible_job_shop_scheduling_with_tabu_search_algorithms","225673248_A_bi-objective_model_for_job-shop_scheduling_problem_to_minimize_both_energy_consumption_and_makespan","222538517_Modelling_and_heuristics_of_FMS_scheduling_with_multiple_objectives","4917936_Scheduling_issues_for_environmentally_responsible_manufacturing_The_case_of_hoist_scheduling_in_an_electroplating_line","3224998_Energy-conscious_deterministic_IO_device_scheduling_in_hard_real-time_systems"]}
