{"id":"309349586_Mapping_hard_real-time_applications_on_many-core_processors","abstract":"Many-core processors are interesting candidates for the design of modern avionics computers. Indeed, the computational power offered by such platforms opens new horizons to design more demanding systems and to integrate more applications on a single target. However, they also bring challenging research topics because of their lack of predictability and their programming complexity. In this paper, we focus on the problem of mapping large applications on a complex platform such as the KALRAY MPPAÂ®-256 while maintaining a strong temporal isolation from co-running applications. We propose a constraint programming formulation of the mapping problem that enables an efficient parallelization and we demonstrate the ability of our approach to deal with large problems using a real world case study.","authors":["Quentin Perret","Pascal Maurere","Eric Noulard","Claire Pagetti"],"meta":["October 2016","DOI:10.1145/2997465.2997496","Conference: the 24th International Conference"],"references":["283540340_Combined_task-_and_network-level_scheduling_for_distributed_time-triggered_systems","281984986_Guaranteed_Services_of_the_NoC_of_a_Manycore_Processor","280852823_A_Stretching_Algorithm_for_Parallel_Real-time_DAG_Tasks_on_Multiprocessor_Systems","280852774_Static_Mapping_of_Real-Time_Applications_onto_Massively_Parallel_Processor_Arrays","280595897_On_the_Scalability_of_Constraint_Solving_for_StaticOff-Line_Real-Time_Scheduling","280302710_Off-line_mapping_of_multi-rate_dependent_task_sets_to_many-core_platforms","277313064_Mixed-criticality_scheduling_on_cluster-based_manycores_with_shared_communication_and_storage_resources","262321500_Global_EDF_scheduling_of_directed_acyclic_graphs_on_multiprocessor_systems","221438824_Reasoning_with_Conditional_Time-Intervals_Part_II_An_Algebraical_Model_for_Resources","221438804_Reasoning_with_Conditional_Time-Intervals","301966698_Contention-Free_Execution_of_Automotive_Applications_on_a_Clustered_Many-Core_Platform","301723407_Temporal_Isolation_of_Hard_Real-Time_Applications_on_Many-Core_Processors","285322605_Time-division_multiplexing_vs_network_calculus_A_comparison","261462341_Embedded_systems_Many_cores_-_Many_problems","261095494_Outstanding_Paper_Award_Analysis_of_Global_EDF_for_Parallel_Tasks","225257666_Dynamic_scheduling_of_real-time_tasks_under_precedence_constraints","220618077_Algorithms_for_Minimum_Coloring_Maximum_Clique_Minimum_Covering_by_Cliques_and_Maximum_Independent_Set_of_a_Chordal_Graph","220566518_Static_Scheduling_Algorithms_for_Allocating_Directed_Task_Graphs_to_Multiprocessors"]}
