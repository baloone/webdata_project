{"id":"318595578_Informing_Design_of_an_Adaptive_Learning_Model_for_student_with_Dyslexia_A_Preliminary_Study","abstract":"Students with dyslexia are known to have difficulties in phonology, spelling, reading, and writing. Therefore, specific intervention needs to be introduced to the students in order to help overcome their difficulties. The existence of Dyslexia Association of Malaysia (DAM) that provides dyslexic intensive education program becomes a primary place for parents to seek for help in intervention. Based on DAM experience in handling students with dyslexia, we conducted a preliminary study comprises semi-structured interview and observation result to uncover their teaching approaches and materials.
