{"id":"308278777_Formulation_and_Validation_of_the_WCIP_Applied_to_the_Analysis_of_Multilayer_Planar_Circuits_Theory_and_Applications","abstract":"The wave concept is a well-established procedure for dealing with electromagnetic problems. The wave concept iterative procedure (WCIP) approach consists of separating the structure studied by an environment which is both superior and inferior, although both acting homogeneously across an interface, in the case of a planar circuit with a single interface. The chapter provides theoretical formulation with simulation results from different case studies, to deal with both coupling problems and propagation issues. A multilayer structure as a quasi-optic compact amplifier is suggested with a detailed analysis in this chapter. The waves within both the spatial and modal spheres are directly inferred by a Fourier modal transform (FMT) and its converse transform the so-called Inverse Fourier modal transform. The decomposition of the electromagnetic wave in propagated modes within a waveguide containing periodic walls occurs through the application of the FMT. To model the amplifier interface, the auxiliary sources method is used.","authors":["A.
