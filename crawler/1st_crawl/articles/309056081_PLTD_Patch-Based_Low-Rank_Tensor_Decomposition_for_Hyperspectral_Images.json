{"id":"309056081_PLTD_Patch-Based_Low-Rank_Tensor_Decomposition_for_Hyperspectral_Images","abstract":"Recent years has witnessed growing interest in hyperspectral image (HSI) processing. In practice, however, HSIs always suffer from huge data size and mass of redundant information, which hinder their application in many cases. HSI compression is a straightforward way of relieving these problems. However, most of the conventional image encoding algorithms mainly focus on the spatial dimensions, and they need not consider the redundancy in the spectral dimension. In this paper, we propose a novel HSI compression and reconstruction algorithm via patch-based low-rank tensor decomposition (PLTD). Instead of processing the HSI separately by spectral channel or by pixel, we represent each local patch of the HSI as a third-order tensor. Then, the similar tensor patches are grouped by clustering to form a fourth-order tensor per cluster. Since the grouped tensor is assumed to be redundant, each cluster can be approximately decomposed to a coefficient tensor and three dictionary matrices, which leads to a low-rank tensor representation of both the spatial and spectral modes. The reconstructed HSI can then be simply obtained by the product of the coefficient tensor and dictionary matrices per cluster. In this way, the proposed PLTD algorithm simultaneously removes the redundancy in both the spatial and spectral domains in a unified framework. The extensive experimental results on various public HSI datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the traditional image compression approaches and other tensor-based methods.","authors":["Bo Du","Mengfei Zhang","Lefei Zhang","Ruimin Hu"],"meta":["September 2016IEEE Transactions on Multimedia
