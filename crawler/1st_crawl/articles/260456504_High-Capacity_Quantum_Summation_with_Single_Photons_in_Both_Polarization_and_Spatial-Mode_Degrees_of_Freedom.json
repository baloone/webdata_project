{"id":"260456504_High-Capacity_Quantum_Summation_with_Single_Photons_in_Both_Polarization_and_Spatial-Mode_Degrees_of_Freedom","abstract":"In this paper, we employ single photons in both polarization and\nspatial-mode degrees of freedom to design a quantum summation protocol.\nWe assume that the third party, i.e. TP, is semi-honest in our protocol.\nThat TP is semi-honest means TP executes the protocol loyally, keeps a\nrecord of all its intermediate computations and might try to steal the\nparticipants' private inputs from the record, but he cannot be corrupted\nby the adversary. Participants can independently encode their private\ninputs on the polarization states and the spatial-mode states of single\nphotons. Thus our protocol doubles the capacity of quantum communication\ncompared with those based on single photons with only one degree of\nfreedom. In addition, our protocol is feasible as the preparation and\nthe measurement of single-photon quantum states in both the polarization\nand the spatial-mode degrees of freedom are available with current\nquantum techniques. We also analyze its security in this paper.","authors":["Cai Zhang","Zhiwei Sun","Yi Huang","Dongyang Long"],"meta":["October 2013International Journal of Theoretical Physics 53(3):523-","DOI:10.1007/s10773-013-1884-9"],"references":["257977107_Theoretically_efficient_high-capacity_quantum-key-distribution_scheme","256097709_Global_illumination_with_radiance_regression_functions","255825105_Trojan-horse_attacks_on_quantum-key-distribution_systems","255818858_Controlled_order_rearrangement_encryption_for_quantum_key_distribution","236566527_Secure_direct_communication_with_a_quantum_one-time_pad","236447392_Efficient_multiparty_quantum-secret-sharing_schemes","235479273_Bidirectional_quantum_key_distribution_protocol_with_practical_faint_laser_pulses","235358039_Photonic_spatial_Bell-state_analysis_for_robust_quantum_secure_directcommunication_using_quantum_dot-cavity_systems","234778924_How_to_play_ANY_mental_game","228109483_WITHDRAWN_Quantum_cryptography_Public_key_distribution_and_coin_tossing","222698860_On_a_problem_in_quantum_summation","45907458_A_Distributed_k-Secure_Sum_Protocol_for_Secure_Multi-Party_Computations","12332437_Simple_Proof_of_Security_of_the_BB84_Quantum_Key_Distribution_Protocol","2203633_How_to_Share_a_Quantum_Secret","2200098_Improving_the_security_of_secure_direct_communication_based_on_secret_transmitting_order_of_particles","2197117_Quantum_secure_direct_communication_with_quantum_encryption_based_on_pure_entangled_states","2196402_Quantum_state_sharing_of_an_arbitrary_two-qubit_state_with_two-photon_entanglements_and_Bell-state_measurements","2194499_Multiparty_Quantum_Secret_Sharing","2191524_Quantum_Boolean_Summation_with_Repetitions_in_the_Worst-Average_Setting","2191071_A_Two-Step_Quantum_Direct_Communication_Protocol_Using_Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen_Pair_Block","293178577_Secure_multiparty_quantum_summation","265833617_Secure_multi-party_computation","263789576_Cryptanalysis_of_the_quantum_state_sharing_protocol_using_four_sets_of_W-class_states","262214413_Communication_Locality_in_Secure_Multi-party_Computation_How_to_Run_Sublinear_Algorithms_in_a_Distributed_Setting","259228663_Quantum_entanglement_for_secret_sharing_and_secret_splitting","258303833_Cryptanalysis_on_the_improved_multiparty_quantum_secret_sharing_protocol_based_on_the_GHZ_state","257978323_Improving_the_security_of_multiparty_quantum_secret_sharing_against_Trojan_horse_attack","257641772_Improvements_on_multiparty_quantum_key_agreement_with_single_particles","257641613_Multi-party_quantum_secret_sharing_with_the_single-particle_quantum_state_to_encode_the_information","257572610_High-Capacity_Three-Party_Quantum_Secret_Sharing_with_Single_Photons_in_Both_the_Polarization_and_the_Spatial-Mode_Degrees_of_Freedom","257572460_High-Capacity_Quantum_Secret_Sharing_with_Hyperdense_Coding_Assisted_by_Hyperentangled_Photon_Pairs","257572356_Quantum_Secure_Direct_Communication_with_Two-Photon_Four-Qubit_Cluster_States","257572298_High-Capacity_Quantum_Secure_Direct_Communication_with_Single_Photons_in_Both_Polarization_and_Spatial-Mode_Degrees_of_Freedom","235532935_Quantum-Classical_Complexity-Security_Tradeoff_In_Secure_Multi-Party_Computation","234527627_Quantum_secure_direct_communication_with_high-dimension_quantum_superdense_coding","231096045_Bidirectional_Quantum_Secure_Direct_Communication_Network_Protocol_with_Hyperentanglement","231031689_Quantum_Secure_Direct_Communication_by_Using_Three-Dimensional_Hyperentanglement","231012625_A_two-step_quantum_secure_direct_communication_protocol_with_hyperentanglement","228109551_Quantum_secret_sharing","225809116_An_Efficient_Protocol_for_the_Secure_Multi-party_Quantum_Summation","223596483_An_efficient_protocol_for_the_private_comparison_of_equal_information_based_on_the_triplet_entangled_state_and_single-particle_measurement","222677258_Quantum_Summation_with_an_Application_to_Integration","222530072_Efficient_high-capacity_quantum_secret_sharing_with_two-photon_entanglement","222393678_Towards_quantum-based_privacy_and_voting","50235630_High-Capacity_Quantum_Secure_Direct_Communication_Based_on_Quantum_Hyperdense_Coding_with_Hyperentanglement","13245023_Ekert_AK_Quantum_Cryptography_Based_on_Bell's_Theorem_Phys_Rev_Lett_676_661","13244012_Quantum_cryptography_without_Bell's_theorem","13243704_Quantum_Cryptography_using_any_two_Nonorthogonal_Sates","2355676_Insecurity_of_Quantum_Secure_Computations","2187000_Multi-party_Quantum_Computation","1890045_Efficient_Quantum_Cryptography_Network_without_Entanglement_and_Quantum_Memory","1890043_Secure_Quantum_Key_Distribution_Network_with_Bell_States_and_Local_Unitary_Operations","1744869_Efficient_quantum_key_distribution_over_a_collective_noise_channel"]}
