{"id":"342010660_Clinical_Trial_Design_and_Development_Work_Group_Within_the_Quantitative_Imaging_Network","abstract":"The Clinical Trial Design and Development Working Group within the Quantitative Imaging Network focuses on providing support for the development, validation, and harmonization of quantitative imaging (QI) methods and tools for use in cancer clinical trials. In the past 10 years, the Group has been working in several areas to identify challenges and opportunities in clinical trials involving QI and radiation oncology. The Group has been working with Quantitative Imaging Network members and the Quantitative Imaging Biomarkers Alliance leadership to develop guidelines for standardizing the reporting of quantitative imaging. As a validation platform, the Group led a multireader study to test a semi-automated positron emission tomography quantification software. Clinical translation of QI tools cannot be possible without a continuing dialogue with clinical users. This article also highlights the outreach activities extended to cooperative groups and other organizations that promote the use of QI tools to support clinical decisions.","authors":["Ella F Jones","John M Buatti","Hui-Kuo G Shu","Richard L Wahl"],"meta":["June 2020Computerized Tomography 6(2)","DOI:10.18383/j.tom.2019.00022"],"references":["339934870_Quantitative_imaging_feature_pipeline_A_web-based_tool_for_utilizing_sharing_and_building_image-processing_pipelines","335328418_QIN_Benchmarks_for_Clinical_Translation_of_Quantitative_Imaging_Tools","331660983_The_Quantitative_Imaging_Network_A_Decade_of_Achievement","326085327_The_Use_of_Quantitative_Imaging_in_Radiation_Oncology_A_Quantitative_Imaging_Network_QIN_Perspective","318591889_Brain_perfusion_imaging_under_acetazolamide_challenge_for_detection_of_impaired_cerebrovascular_reserve_capacity_positive_findings_with_O-15-water_PET_in_patients_with_negative_Tc-99m-HMPAO_SPECT","313433863_Accrual_Patterns_for_Clinical_Studies_Involving_Quantitative_Imaging_Results_of_an_NCI_Quantitative_Imaging_Network_QIN_Survey","290624994_Quantitative_Imaging_in_Cancer_Clinical_Trials","283305454_STARD_2015_An_Updated_List_of_Essential_Items_for_Reporting_Diagnostic_Accuracy_Studies","308819364_Repeatability_of_18F-FLT_PET_in_a_Multicenter_Study_of_Patients_with_High-Grade_Glioma","267742421_Reporting_Diagnostic_Accuracy_Studies_Some_Improvements_after_10_Years_of_STARD"]}
