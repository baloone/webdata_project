{"id":"222191456_Recognition_and_Parsing_of_Context_Free_Languages_in_Time_n3","abstract":"A recognition algorithm is exhibited whereby an arbitrary string over a given vocabulary can be tested for containment in a given context-free language. A special merit of this algorithm is that it is completed in a number of steps proportional to the “cube” of the number of symbols in the tested string. As a byproduct of the grammatical analysis, required by the recognition algorithm, one can obtain, by some additional processing not exceeding the “cube” factor of computational complexity, a parsing matrix—a complete summary of the grammatical structure of the sentence. It is also shown how, by means of a minor modification of the recognition algorithm, one can obtain an integer representing the ambiguity of the sentence, i.e., the number of distinct ways in which that sentence can be generated by the grammar.The recognition algorithm is then simulated on a Turing Machine. It is shown that this simulation likewise requires a number of steps proportional to only the “cube” of the test string length.","authors":["Daniel Younger"],"meta":["February 1967Information and Control 10(2):189-208","DOI:10.1016/S0019-9958(67)80007-X","SourceDBLP"],"references":["242506038_On_the_Computational_Complexity_of_Algorithms","224107211_Hierarchies_of_Memory_Limited_Computations","268700233_A_parsing_procedure","266304770_On_the_computational_complexity_of_algorithms","243508968_On_the_relative_effieiencies_of_context-free_grammar_recognizers","242568180_Variable-Length_Binary_Encodings","242404803_Syntax_in_universal_translation","239540714_An_efficient_recognition_and_syntax_algortihm_for_context-free_languages","238690909_Readings_in_automatic_language_processing","235058473_AN_EFFICIENT_RECOGNITION_AND_SYNTAXANALYSIS_ALGORITHM_FOR_CONTEXT-FREE_LANGUAGES","230876221_Multiple-Path_Syntactic_Analyzer","230875918_Formal_Properties_of_Grammars","224107212_Memory_bounds_for_recognition_of_context-free_and_context-sensitive_languages","222511947_On_Certain_Formal_Properties_of_Grammars","220430875_Two-Tape_Simulation_of_Multitape_Turing_Machines","220425059_The_predictive_analyzer_and_a_path_elimination_technique"]}
