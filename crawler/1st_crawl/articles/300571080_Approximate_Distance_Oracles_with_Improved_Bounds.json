{"id":"300571080_Approximate_Distance_Oracles_with_Improved_Bounds","abstract":"A distance oracle is a compact data structure capable of quickly estimating distances in a given graph. In this paper we provide a new construction for distance oracles in general undirected weighted graphs. Our data structure, for any integer k, requires O( n1+1/k) space, guarantees a stretch of 2k-1, and answers any query in only O(1) time.","authors":["Shiri Chechik"],"meta":["June 2015","DOI:10.1145/2746539.2746562","Conference: the Forty-Seventh Annual ACM"],"references":["225201527_Distance_Oracles_for_Unweighted_Graphs_Breaking_the_Quadratic_Barrier_with_Constant_Additive_Error","224678293_Ramsey_partitions_and_proximity_data_structures","221498316_Faster_Algorithms_for_Approximate_Distance_Oracles_and_All-Pairs_Small_Stretch_Paths","221234082_On_Approximate_Distance_Labels_and_Routing_Schemes_with_Affine_Stretch","220618199_Near-Linear_Time_Construction_of_Sparse_Neighborhood_Covers","220452641_On_Sparse_Spanners_of_Weighted_Graphs","1958749_Ramsey_partitions_and_proximity_data_structures","1774190_Fast_C-K-R_Partitions_of_Sparse_Graphs","284684743_Extremal_problems_in_graph_theory","261959219_Shortest-Path_Queries_in_Static_Networks","261211956_A_New_Infinity_of_Distance_Oracles_for_Sparse_Graphs","239565142_Fast_algorithms_for_t-spanners_and_stretch-t_paths","236834534_Approximate_Distance_Oracle_with_Constant_Query_Time","225487145_On_the_distortion_required_for_embedding_finite_metric_spaces_into_normed_spaces","225177720_Deterministic_Constructions_of_Approximate_Distance_Oracles_and_Spanners","221663209_Approximate_Distance_Oracles_with_Improved_Query_Time","221498269_Distance_Oracles_beyond_the_Thorup--Zwick_Bound","51938440_Approximate_Distance_Oracles_with_Improved_Preprocessing_Time","45907400_Scale-oblivious_metric_fragmentation_and_the_nonlinear_Dvoretzky_theorem","2935062_Approximate_Distance_Oracles"]}
