{"id":"225234877_A_bibliometric_study_of_the_trend_in_articles_related_to_eutrophication_published_in_Science_Citation_Index","abstract":"A keyword analysis was applied in this work to evaluate research trends of eutrophication papers published between 1991 and\n2010 in any journal of all the subject categories of the Science Citation Index compiled by Institute for Scientific Information,\nPhiladelphia, USA. Eutrophication was used as a keyword to search parts of titles, abstracts, or keywords. The published output\nanalysis showed that eutrophication research steadily increased over the past 20years and the annual publication output in\n2008, 2009, 2010 were about four times that of 1991. The whole paper published by China ranked at 3rd, but these papers’ IF\nwere lower than the average of the world. “Water Framework Directive” and “Life Cycle Assessment” were two of the most frequently\nused author keywords in the period between 1999 and 2010 whilst they did not appear before 1998. These new conception indicated\neutrophication research trend was changing to policy and management from technological researches.\n\nKeywordsEutrophication–Bibliometric–SCI–Water framework directive–Life cycle assessment","authors":["Yi Huang","Jie Wang"],"meta":["December 2011Scientometrics 89(3):919-927","DOI:10.1007/s11192-011-0479-6","SourceDBLP"],"references":["228647955_Internal_eutrophication_How_it_works_and_what_to_do_about_it_-_A_review","227010710_Development_of_regional_characterization_factors_for_aquatic_eutrophication","200032848_R_EPORTS_Forecasting_Agriculturally_Driven_Global_Environmental_Change","43270567_Non-Point_Pollution_of_Surface_Waters_With_Phosphorus_and_Nitrogen","24026915_ECOLOGY_Controlling_Eutrophication_Nitrogen_and_Phosphorus","12031470_Forecasting_Agriculturally_Driven_Global_Environmental_Change","255649878_The_Cumulative_Effects_of_Climate_Warming_and_Other_Human_Stresses_on_Canadian_Freshwaters_in_the_New_Millennium","250076671_Technical_Report_Human_Alteration_of_the_Global_Nitrogen_Cycle_Sources_and_Consequences","248017572_Trends_in_Eutrophication_Research_and_Control","242916045_Relations_of_relative_scientometric_impact_indicators_The_relative_publication_strategy_index","238594572_Seasonal_Changes_in_Height_Biomass_and_Biomass_Allocation_of_Two_Exotic_Aquatic_Plants_in_a_Shallow_Eutrophic_Lake","228613116_Recent_Advances_in_the_Understanding_and_Management_of_Eutrophication","225266723_Water_frame_directive_-_An_effective_approach_for_pollution_prevention_of_water_sources_in_case_of_emergencies_at_river_basin_level","221942355_In_situ_removal_of_dissolved_phosphorus_in_irrigation_drainage_water_by_planted_floats_Preliminary_results_from_growth_chamber_trial","216814940_Human_Alteration_Of_The_Global_Nitrogen_Cycle_Sources_And_Consequences","24043370_Eutrophication_science_Where_do_we_go_from_here","10776305_Eutrophication_of_Freshwater_and_Coastal_Marine_Ecosystems_A_Global_Problem","8650200_Life_Cycle_Assessment_Part_1_Framework_Goal_and_Scope_Definition_Inventory_Analysis_and_Applications"]}
