{"id":"311420875_Orchestrating_21st_century_learning_in_higher_education_A_perspective_on_student_voice","abstract":"For universities to meet the 21st-century learning needs of today's students, it is important they allow students to take an active role in developing pedagogy and sharing their perspective. This paper introduces design-based research aiming to develop a pedagogic approach to support technology-enhanced learning practices at the university level with the focus on teacher orchestration of learning activities and student voice. Drawing from the perspectives of teachers and students who participated in a course focused on learning and 21st-century competencies, four main elements indicating student voice and technology-enhanced pedagogy are presented: increased interaction among university communities, teacher orchestration, technology and collaborative learning. Enabling and hindering factors related to student voice are presented for each element.","authors":["Raija Hämäläinen","Carita Kiili","Blaine Smith"],"meta":["August 2017British Journal of Educational Technology 48(5)","DOI:10.1111/bjet.12533"],"references":["313397132_What_is_Qualitative_Interviewing","278914723_New_Literacies_A_Dual-Level_Theory_of_the_Changing_Nature_of_Literacy_Instruction_and_Assessment","348868044_Research_Methods_in_Education","304007324_Rethinking_the_challenges_and_possibilities_of_student_voice_and_agency","293014925_Digging_deeper_Understanding_the_power_of_'student_voice","285898613_Case_study_in_social_research","282259613_From_Listening_to_Empowering_A_Study_of_High_School_Principals'_Perceptions_of_Student_Voice_in_Classroom_Instruction","281562607_The_Sage_Handbook_of_Social_Research_Methods","271429289_Design_Research_Theoretical_and_Methodological_Issues","266326788_Explaining_university_students'_strong_commitment_to_understand_through_individual_and_contextual_elements"]}
