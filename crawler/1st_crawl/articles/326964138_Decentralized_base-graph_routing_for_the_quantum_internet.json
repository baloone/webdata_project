{"id":"326964138_Decentralized_base-graph_routing_for_the_quantum_internet","abstract":"Quantum repeater networks are a fundamental of any future quantum internet and long-distance quantum communications. The entangled quantum nodes can communicate through several different levels of entanglement, leading to a heterogeneous, multilevel network structure. The level of entanglement between the quantum nodes determines the hop distance and the probability of the existence of an entangled link in the network. Here, we define a decentralized routing for entangled quantum networks. The proposed method allows an efficient routing to find the shortest paths in entangled quantum networks by using only local knowledge of the quantum nodes. We give bounds on the maximum value of the total number of entangled links of a path. The proposed scheme can be directly applied in practical quantum communications and quantum networking scenarios.","authors":["Laszlo Gyongyosi","Sandor Imre"],"meta":["August 2018","DOI:10.1103/PhysRevA.98.022310"],"references":["326379156_Entanglement_Availability_Differentiation_Service_for_the_Quantum_Internet","322202221_A_Survey_on_Quantum_Channel_Capacities","321347744_Theory_of_channel_simulation_and_bounds_for_private_communication","320296685_Entanglement-Gradient_Routing_for_Quantum_Networks","316489767_Fundamental_limits_of_repeaterless_quantum_communications","311067084_Quantum_Machine_Learning","308744265_Quantum_Secure_Direct_Communication_with_Quantum_Memory","235467911_Multicopy_and_stochastic_transformation_of_multipartite_pure_states","228059718_Path_Selection_for_Quantum_Repeater_Networks","220995299_Quantum_Network_Coding","220195300_Infrastructure_for_the_quantum_Internet","24013464_Quantum_Repeaters_based_on_Single_Trapped_Ions","23230850_Multistage_Entanglement_Swapping","6880708_Hybrid_Quantum_Repeater_Using_Bright_Coherent_Light","6161322_Robust_Creation_of_Entanglement_between_Remote_Memory_Qubits","6160958_Quantum_Repeaters_with_Photon_Pair_Sources_and_Multimode_Memories","2201970_Quantifying_Entanglement","2201074_Quantum_Communication","2197173_Review_article_Linear_optical_quantum_computing","317941604_Distributed_secure_quantum_machine_learning","301836840_General_bounds_for_sender-receiver_capacities_in_multipoint_quantum_communications","291184753_Optical_microcavity_from_fundamental_physics_to_functional_photonics_devices","285945223_Quantum_Networking","276970779_Photonic_Channels_for_Quantum_Communication","266017428_Random_Networks_for_Communication_From_Statistical_Physics_to_Information_Systems","264474309_Photon-echo_quantum_memory_in_solid_state_systems","260670546_On_the_Way_to_Quantum-Based_Satellite_Communication","259600234_Quantum_repeaters_based_on_entanglement_purification","258082655_Ultrafast_and_Fault-Tolerant_Quantum_Communication_across_Long_Distances","243964117_Quantum_principal_component_analysis","233835323_Quantum_Repeaters_The_Role_of_Imperfect_Local_Operations_in_Quantum_Communication","225070175_A_Note_on_Two_Problems_in_Connexion_With_Graphs","13375764_Shor_P_W_Scheme_for_reducing_decoherence_in_quantum_computer_memory_Phys_Rev_A_52_R2493-R2496","11635346_Long-distance_quantum_communication_with_atomic_ensembles_and_linear_optics","6409030_Functional_Quantum_Nodes_for_Entanglement_Distribution_over_Scalable_Quantum_Networks","5291818_The_Quantum_Internet","2202255_Entanglement_Measures_and_Purification_Procedures","2201539_Capacity_of_the_noisy_quantum_channel","2199256_Quantum_Network_Communication-The_Butterfly_and_Beyond","2185651_The_Role_of_Relative_Entropy_in_Quantum_Information_Theory","1892702_Prior_entanglement_between_senders_enables_perfect_quantum_network_coding_with_modification","1892099_Entanglement_purification_and_quantum_error_correction"]}
