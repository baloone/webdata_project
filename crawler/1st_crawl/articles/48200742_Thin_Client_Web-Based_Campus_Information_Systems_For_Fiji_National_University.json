{"id":"48200742_Thin_Client_Web-Based_Campus_Information_Systems_For_Fiji_National_University","abstract":"Fiji National University is encountering many difficulties with its current\nadministrative systems. These difficulties include accessibility, scalability,\nperformance, flexibility and integration. We propose a new campus information\nsystem, FNU-CIS to addresses these difficulties. FNU-CIS has the potential to\nprovide wide range of the services for students and staffs at the university.\nIn order to assist in the design and implementation of proposed FNU-CIS, we\npresent an overview, software architecture and prototype implementation of our\nproposed system. We discuss the key properties of our system, compare it with\nother similar systems available and outline our future plans for research in\nFNU-CIS implementation.","authors":["Bimal Aklesh Kumar"],"meta":["February 2011International Journal of Software Engineering & Applications 2(1)","DOI:10.5121/ijsea.2011.2102","SourcearXiv"],"references":["234722315_The_Next-Generation_Infrastructure","221549354_Web_services_and_CORBA"]}
