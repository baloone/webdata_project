{"id":"257028394_Uniqueness_of_Stable_Processes_with_Drift","abstract":"Suppose that $d\\geq1$ and $\\alpha\\in (1, 2)$. Let $Y$ be a rotationally\nsymmetric $\\alpha$-stable process on $\\R^d$ and $b$ a $\\R^d$-valued measurable\nfunction on $\\R^d$ belonging to a certain Kato class of $Y$. We show that $\\rd\nX^b_t=\\rd Y_t+b(X^b_t)\\rd t$ with $X^b_0=x$ has a unique weak solution for\nevery $x\\in \\R^d$. Let $\\sL^b=-(-\\Delta)^{\\alpha/2} + b \\cdot \\nabla$, which is\nthe infinitesimal generator of $X^b$. Denote by $C^\\infty_c(\\R^d)$ the space of\nsmooth functions on $\\R^d$ with compact support. We further show that the\nmartingale problem for $(\\sL^b, C^\\infty_c(\\R^d))$ has a unique solution for\neach initial value $x\\in \\R^d$.","authors":["Zhen-Qing Chen","Longmin Wang"],"meta":["September 2013Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society 144(6)","DOI:10.1090/proc/12909","SourcearXiv"],"references":["47797014_Dirichlet_heat_kernel_estimates_for_fractional_Laplacian_with_gradientperturbation","38351761_Brownian_motion_with_singular_drift","265076669_Diffusions_and_Elliptic_Operators","260912534_Stable_process_with_singular_drift","237127954_Semimartingale_Theory_and_Stochastic_Calculus","225230344_Equivalence_of_Stochastic_Equations_and_Martingale_Problems","225134440_Estimates_of_Heat_Kernel_of_Fractional_Laplacian_Perturbed_by_Gradient_Operators","222539199_Drift_transforms_and_Green_function_estimates_for_discontinuous_processes"]}
