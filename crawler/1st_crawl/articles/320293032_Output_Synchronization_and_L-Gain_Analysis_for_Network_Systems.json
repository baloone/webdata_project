Nodes in the heterogeneous network have nonidentical dynamics. The designed distributed controller contains reference generator to copy the dynamics of the target trajectory and robust regulator (RG) to achieve synchronization purpose. All RGs adopt the network communication channels to exchange system information. The distributed control law is calculated on static output feedback and ensure outputs of RGs converges to the target trajectory. Meanwhile, each nonidentical node tracks its RG with L\n<sub xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\nperformance index. The controller design strategy is presented in the obtained necessary and sufficient conditions. Finally, the effectiveness of the controller design strategy is demonstrated by a numerical example.","authors":["Yuanqing Wu","Renquan Lu"],"meta":["October 2017IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems PP(99):1-10","DOI:10.1109/TSMC.2017.2754544"],"references":["271715200_Cooperative_Distributed_Optimization_in_Multiagent_Networks_With_Delays","229086446_An_Overview_of_Recent_Progress_in_the_Study_of_Distributed_Multi-Agent_Coordination","317847287_Advanced_Textbooks_in_Control_and_Signal_Processing","317141401_Event-Based_Fault_Detection_Filtering_for_Complex_Networked_Jump_Systems","312465088_Fault_Detection_Filtering_for_Nonhomogeneous_Markovian_Jump_Systems_via_Fuzzy_Approach","312241730_Reliable_Output_Feedback_Control_of_Discrete-Time_Fuzzy_Affine_Systems_With_Actuator_Faults","309628655_An_input-based_triggering_approach_to_leader-following_problems","303549858_Neural_Network-Based_Passive_Filtering_for_Delayed_Neutral-Type_Semi-Markovian_Jump_Systems","297722655_Neural_Network_Control-Based_Adaptive_Learning_Design_for_Nonlinear_Systems_With_Full-State_Constraints","283705591_A_General_Framework_for_Robust_Output_Synchronization_of_Heterogeneous_Nonlinear_Networked_Systems","282400113_Neural-Network-Based_Distributed_Adaptive_Robust_Control_for_a_Class_of_Nonlinear_Multiagent_Systems_With_Time_Delays_and_External_Noises","282307486_Robust_output_synchronisation_of_non-identical_linear_agents_via_internal_model_principle","282189175_Robust_perturbed_output_regulation_and_its_application_to_synchronization_of_nonlinear_heterogeneous_multi-agents","281634351_A_Unified_Approach_to_Adaptive_Neural_Control_for_Nonlinear_Discrete-Time_Systems_With_Nonlinear_Dead-Zone_Input","267213864_Distributed_Average_Tracking_of_Networked_Euler-Lagrange_Systems","264743751_Distributed_Finite-Time_Containment_Control_for_Double-Integrator_Multiagent_Systems","264339142_Cooperative_robust_output_regulation_of_linear_uncertain_multi-agent_systems","260626732_Evolutionary_Pinning_Control_and_Its_Application_in_UAV_Coordination","245322261_Extended_H2_and_H_characterization_and_controller_parametrizations_for_discrete-time_systems","237148042_H_Consensus_and_Synchronization_of_Nonlinear_Systems_Based_on_A_Novel_Fuzzy_Model","230671807_Distributed_Synchronization_in_Networks_of_Agent_Systems_With_Nonlinearities_and_Random_Switchings","224603550_Robust_Adaptive_Tracking_Control_for_Nonlinear_Systems_Based_on_Bounds_of_Fuzzy_Approximation_Parameters","221978616_Weighted_Average_Prediction_for_Improving_Consensus_Performance_of_Second-Order_Delayed_Multi-Agent_Systems","220387420_Output_Consensus_of_Heterogeneous_Uncertain_Linear_Multi-Agent_Systems","220157743_Second-order_consensus_in_multi-agent_dynamical_systems_with_sampled_position_data","26706360_A_Multiagent_Evolutionary_Algorithm_for_Combinatorial_Optimization_Problems"]}
