{"id":"337372188_Supporting_Data_Structures_Visualization_for_Teachers_and_Learners","abstract":"Teachers of first courses in Computing face the problem of making slides showing data structures. Students must also show them in their assignments. Drawing them may not be the best choice. The Data Structures (DSTR) language proposed here is intended as an easy-to-use tool to describe those structures for visualization. A preliminary evaluation of a tool to interpret DSTR statements shows users’ acceptance.","authors":["Jonathan Urzúa","Nelson Baloian","Pino"],"meta":["November 2019","DOI:10.3390/proceedings2019031008"],"references":["320906463_SEED_A_software_tool_and_an_active-learning_strategy_for_data_structures_courses","312940406_Computer_Science_Curricula_2013_Curriculum_Guidelines_for_Undergraduate_Degree_Programs_in_Computer_Science","262256856_CSTutor_A_Sketch-Based_Tool_for_Visualizing_Data_Structures","222154204_Concept_keyboards_in_the_animation_of_standard_algorithms"]}
