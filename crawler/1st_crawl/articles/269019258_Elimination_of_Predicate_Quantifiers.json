{"id":"269019258_Elimination_of_Predicate_Quantifiers","abstract":"Formulae of higher-order predicate logic are difficult to handle with automated inference systems. Some of these formulae, however, are equivalent to formulae of first-order predicate logic or even propositional logic. For example the formula of second-order predicate logic P (P P) is trivially equivalent to the propositional constant false. In applications where formulae of higher-order predicate logic occur naturally it is very useful to determine whether the given formula is in fact equivalent to a simpler formula of first-order or propositional logic. Typical applications where this occurs are predicate minimization by circumscription, correspondence theory in non-classical logic, and simple versions of set theory. In these areas we are faced with formulae of second-order predicate logic with existentially or universally quantified predicate variables and we want to simplify them by computing equivalent first-order formulae.","authors":["Andreas Nonnengart","Hans JÃ¼rgen Ohlbach","Andrzej Szalas"],"meta":["January 1999","DOI:10.1007/978-94-011-4574-9_9"],"references":["226774003_Computing_Circumscription_Revisited_A_Reduction_Algorithm","319394462_Extending_Modal_Logic","266303170_A_Survey_of_Boolean_Algebras_with_Operators","254854107_Extending_modal_logic","243779915_Boolean_Algebras_with_Operators_Part_I","243596277_Modal_Logic_and_Classical_Logic","226203708_Zum_Eliminationsproblem_der_mathematischen_Logik","225951577_Untersuchungen_ber_das_Eliminationsproblem_der_mathematischen_Logik","221604242_Some_Computational_Aspects_of_Circumscription","220815833_Computing_Circumscription"]}
