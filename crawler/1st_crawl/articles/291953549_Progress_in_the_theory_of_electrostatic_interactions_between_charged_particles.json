{"id":"291953549_Progress_in_the_theory_of_electrostatic_interactions_between_charged_particles","abstract":"In this Perspective we examine recent theoretical developments in methods for calculating the electrostatic properties of charged particles of dielectric materials. Particular attention is paid to the phenomenon of like-charge attraction and we investigate the specific conditions under which particles carrying the same sign of charge can experience an attractive interac-tion. Given favourable circumstances, it is shown that even weakly polarisable materials, such as oil droplets and polymer particles, can experience like-charge attraction. Emphasis is also placed on the numerical accuracy of the multipole approach adopted in many electrostat-ic solutions and on the importance of establishing strict convergence criteria when addressing problems involving particulate materials with high dielectric constants.","authors":["Eric B Lindgren","Ho-Kei Chan","Anthony J Stace","Elena Besley"],"meta":["January 2016Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics 18(8)","DOI:10.1039/C5CP07709E"],"references":["274933494_A_General_Geometric_Representation_of_Sphere-Sphere_Interactions","260373331_Electrostatic_force_between_a_charged_sphere_and_a_planar_surface_A_general_solution_for_dielectric_materials","258710075_Electrostatics_of_two_charged_conducting_spheres","258040276_Surface-charge_distribution_on_a_dielectric_sphere_due_to_an_external_point_charge_Examples_of_C60_and_C240_fullerenes","257084544_Electrostatic_powder_coating_of_foods_-_State_of_the_art_and_opportunities","255765995_Absolute_electrostatic_force_between_two_charged_particles_in_a_low_dielectric_solvent","236945077_ELECTROSTATIC_INTERACTION_BETWEEN_TWO_CONDUCTING_SPHERES","236636128_Coulomb_Fission_in_Dielectric_Dication_Clusters_Experiment_and_Theory_on_Steps_That_May_Underpin_the_Electrospray_Mechanism","231128629_The_characteristics_of_particle_charging_and_deposition_during_powder_coating_processes_with_ultrafine_powder","231055061_Self-charging_of_the_Eyjafjallajokull_volcanic_ash_plume","51576891_Treating_highly_charged_carbon_and_fullerene_clusters_as_dielectric_particles","45198330_Electrostatic_analysis_of_the_interactions_between_charged_particles_of_dielectric_materials","6333305_Interaction_forces_between_colloidal_particles_in_liquid_Theory_and_experiment","5913991_Attraction_of_Positively_Charged_Particles_in_Highly_Collisional_Plasmas","3165728_Effects_of_the_Charge-Dipole_Interaction_on_the_Coagulation_of_Fractal_Aggregates","285381122_Extracts_of_two_letters_to_mr_Liouville","265930317_Static_and_Dynamic_Electricity","263949448_Surface_Charge_of_a_Nanoparticle_Interacting_with_a_Flat_Substrate","263215250_Interaction_of_two_dielectric_macroparticles","259125273_Analysis_of_general_multipolar_images_on_dielectric_layers_for_the_calculation_of_DEP_force","258669711_Interacting_nanoparticles_with_functional_surface_groups","257955103_Electrostatics_of_two_charged_conducting_ellipsoids","244381504_Electrostatic_Interaction_between_a_Sphere_and_a_Planar_Surface_Generalization_of_Point-ChargeSurface_Image_Interaction_to_ParticleSurface_Image_Interaction","235627740_Electrostatic_interaction_in_the_presence_of_dielectric_interfaces_and_polarization-induced_like-charge_attraction","232969353_Are_single_C60_fullerenes_dielectric_or_metallic","232395465_The_contribution_of_the_electrostatic_proximity_force_to_atomic_force_microscopy_with_insulators","228627667_The_global_atmospheric_electric_circuit_and_its_effect_on_cloud_microphysics","223342130_Relative_importance_of_electrostatic_forces_on_powder_particles","223306234_Twenty-first_century_research_needs_in_electrostatic_processes_applied_to_industry_and_medicine","222915853_Measurement_of_the_surface_charge_of_ultrafine_particles_from_laser_printers_and_analysis_of_their_electrostatic_force","222615678_Modern_electrostatic_devices_and_methods_for_exhaust_gas_cleaning_A_brief_review","49657732_Why_like-charged_particles_of_dielectric_materials_can_be_attracted_to_one_another","44885078_Further_experiments_on_collisional_tribocharging_of_cosmic_grains","43155311_Electrification_of_volcanic_plumes","31069340_Two_Charged_Spherical_Conductors_in_a_Uniform_Electric_Field_Forces_and_Field_Strength","23458616_Electrostatic_Interactions_of_Colloidal_Particles_at_Vanishing_Ionic_Strength","6880342_Electrostatics_of_charged_dielectric_spheres_with_application_to_biological_systems","5785004_Electrostatic_Interactions_of_Colloidal_Particles_in_Nonpolar_Solvents_Role_of_Surface_Chemistry_and_Charge_Control_Agents","5318950_Electrostatics_in_the_presence_of_spherical_dielectric_discontinuities","1834586_Image_charges_in_spherical_geometry_Application_to_colloidal_systems"]}
