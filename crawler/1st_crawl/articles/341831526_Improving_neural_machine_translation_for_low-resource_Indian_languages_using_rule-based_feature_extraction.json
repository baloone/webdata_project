{"id":"341831526_Improving_neural_machine_translation_for_low-resource_Indian_languages_using_rule-based_feature_extraction","abstract":"Languages help to unite the world socially, culturally and technologically. Different natives communicate in different languages; there is a tremendous requirement for inter-language information translation process to transfer and share information and ideas. Though Sanskrit is an ancient Indo-European language, a significant amount of work for processing the information is required to explore the full potential of this language to open vistas in computational linguistics and computer science domain. In this paper, we have proposed and presented the machine translation system for translating Sanskrit to the Hindi language. The developed technique uses linguistic features from rule-based feed to train neural machine translation system. The work is novel and applicable to any low-resource language with rich morphology. It is a generic system covering various domains with minimal human intervention. The performance analysis of work is performed on automatic and linguistic measures. The results show that proposed and developed approach outperforms earlier work for this language pair.","authors":["Muskaan Singh","Ravinder Kumar","Inderveer Chana"],"meta":["February 2021Neural Computing and Applications 33(2)","DOI:10.1007/s00521-020-04990-9"],"references":["324600343_Demo_of_Sanskrit-Hindi_SMT_System","307914149_Error_Analysis_of_SaHiT_-_A_Statistical_Sanskrit-Hindi_Translator","321595313_Sanskrit_Computational_Linguistics_First_and_Second_International_Symposia_Rocquencourt_France_October_29-31_2007_Providence_RI_USA_May_15-17_2008_Revised_Selected_and_Invited_Papers","321594544_Sanskrit_Computational_Linguistics_Third_International_Symposium_Hyderabad_India_January_15-17_2009_Proceedings","320920545_Synthetic_and_Natural_Noise_Both_Break_Neural_Machine_Translation","317230380_Convergence_Analysis_of_Two-layer_Neural_Networks_with_ReLU_Activation","311469848_Recurrent_neural_network_based_language_model","306094276_Linguistic_Input_Features_Improve_Neural_Machine_Translation","301404654_Fast_and_Accurate_Preordering_for_SMT_using_Neural_Networks","289758666_Recurrent_continuous_translation_models","270877878_Fast_and_Robust_Neural_Network_Joint_Models_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation","283507531_Nature_in_Indian_Philosophy_and_Cultural_Traditions","281145060_Effective_Approaches_to_Attention-based_Neural_Machine_Translation","270878061_A_Unified_Model_for_Soft_Linguistic_Reordering_Constraints_in_Statistical_Machine_Translation","270878020_Factored_Language_Model_based_on_Recurrent_Neural_Network"]}
