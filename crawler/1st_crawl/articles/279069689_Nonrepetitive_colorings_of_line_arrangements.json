{"id":"279069689_Nonrepetitive_colorings_of_line_arrangements","abstract":"A sequence is nonrepetitive if no two adjacent segments of are identical. A famous result of Thue from 1906 asserts that there are arbitrarily long nonrepetitive sequences over 3 symbols. We study the following geometric variant of this problem. Given a set of points in the plane and a set of lines, what is the least number of colors needed to color so that every line in is nonrepetitive? If consists of all intersection points of a prescribed set of lines , then we prove that there is such coloring using at most 405 colors. The proof is based on a theorem of Thue and on a result of Alon and Marshall concerning homomorphisms of edge colored planar graphs. We also consider nonrepetitive colorings involving other geometric structures. For instance, a nonrepetitive analog of the famous Hadwiger–Nelson problem is formulated as follows: what is the least number of colors needed to color the plane so that every path of the unit distance graph whose vertices are colinear is nonrepetitive? Using a theorem of Thue we prove that this number is at most .","authors":["Jarosław Grytczuk","Karol Kosiński","Michał Zmarz"],"meta":["January 2016European Journal of Combinatorics 51","DOI:10.1016/j.ejc.2015.05.013"],"references":["226829480_Homomorphisms_of_Edge-Colored_Graphs_and_Coxeter_Groups","256157728_Acyclic_colorings_of_planar_graphs","243112151_On_square-free_vertex_colorings_of_graphs","227786622_Nonrepetitive_Colorings_of_Graphs","222765630_Thue_type_problems_for_graphs","222750002_Pattern_avoidance_Themes_and_variations","222704628_Nonrepetitive_colorings_of_graphs_of_bounded_tree-width","222668281_The_origins_of_combinatorics_on_words","220152037_Multidimensional_Unrepetitive_Configurations"]}
