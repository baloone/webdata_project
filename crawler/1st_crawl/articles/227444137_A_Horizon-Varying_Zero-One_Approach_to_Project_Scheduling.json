{"id":"227444137_A_Horizon-Varying_Zero-One_Approach_to_Project_Scheduling","abstract":"Bounding techniques similar to those used with branch and bound procedures are used in this study in conjunction with zero-one programming to produce minimum duration schedules for the resource constrained, project scheduling problem. The algorithms developed consist of examining the feasibility of a series of zero-one programming problems rather than solving one zero-one problem optimally. Computational results demonstrate the advantage of this method over using zero-one programming without employing any form of bounding. A comparison with other exact procedures for solving the resource constrained, project scheduling problem is also given.","authors":["James H. Patterson","Walter D.
