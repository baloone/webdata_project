{"id":"50893529_Are_symbolic_powers_highly_evolved","abstract":"Searching for structural reasons behind old results and conjectures of\nChudnovksy regarding the least degree of a nonzero form in an ideal of fat\npoints in projective N-space, we make conjectures which explain them, and we\nprove the conjectures in certain cases, including the case of general points in\nthe projective plane. Our conjectures were also partly motivated by the\nEisenbud-Mazur Conjecture on evolutions, which concerns symbolic squares of\nprime ideals in local rings, but in contrast we consider higher symbolic powers\nof homogeneous ideals in polynomial rings.","authors":["Brian Harbourne","Craig L.
