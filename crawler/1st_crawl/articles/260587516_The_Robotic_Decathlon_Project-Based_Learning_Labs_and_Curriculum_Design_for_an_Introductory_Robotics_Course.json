{"id":"260587516_The_Robotic_Decathlon_Project-Based_Learning_Labs_and_Curriculum_Design_for_an_Introductory_Robotics_Course","abstract":"This paper presents a series of novel project-based learning labs for an introductory robotics course that are developed into a semester-long Robotic Decathlon. The last three events of the Robotic Decathlon are used as three final one-week-long project tasks; these replace a previous course project that was a semester-long robotics competition. The course assessment shows that this new approach enhances student learning with respect to the standard lecture/test style of teaching, and that the three shorter final project tasks make the course easier to manage and more enjoyable for the students.","authors":["David J Cappelleri","Nikolaos Vitoroulis"],"meta":["February 2013IEEE Transactions on Education 56(1):73-81","DOI:10.1109/TE.2012.2215329"],"references":["344532406_A_Practice_Integrated_Undergraduate_Curriculum_In_Mechanical_Engineering","266460185_DEVELOPMENT_OF_A_SUCCESSFUL_OPEN-ENDED_ROBOTICS_DESIGN_COURSE_AT_THE_HIGH_SCHOOL_LEVEL","246069451_Engineering_Education_Is_Problem-Based_or_Project-Based_Learning_the_Answer","225308929_Ten_Years_of_Cybertech_The_Educational_Benefits_of_Bullfighting_Robotics","224587503_Engaging_Robots_Innovative_Outreach_for_Attracting_Cybernetics_Students","220774383_Robotics_competitions_in_engineering_eduction","4246460_Fun_with_Robots_a_student-taught_undergraduate_robotics_course","4077100_The_Remote_Exploration_Program_a_collaborative_outreach_approach_to_robotics_education","3721233_Development_of_an_undergraduate_robotics_course","3050887_Teaching_Introductory_Autonomous_Robotics_With_JavaScript_Simulations_and_Actual_Robots","2681523_A_Robot_Laboratory_for_Teaching_Artificial_Intelligence","298538138_Special_issue_-_Trends_in_Robotics_Education","247277286_Project-oriented_Study_and_Project-organized_Curricula_A_Brief_Review_of_Intentions_and_Solutions","237295432_Retention_101_Where_Robots_GoStudents_Follow","224773224_Principles_of_Robot_Motion_Theory_Algorithms_and_Implementations","37441265_Introduction_to_Autonomous_Mobile_Robots","4077210_A_hands-on_laboratory_based_approach_to_undergraduate_robotics_education","4077174_Project_in_robotics_at_The_Copenhagen_University_College_of_Engineering","3344781_Education_by_competition","3344645_Modern_robotics_engineering_instruction","3344642_Vision-guided_mobile_robots_for_design_competitions","3344598_Grasping_the_interdisciplinary_of_mechatronics","3344596_Learning_while_doing_Practical_robotics_education","3344594_Competing_for_a_robotics_education"]}
