{"id":"342219617_Impact_assessment_of_outcome_based_approach_in_engineering_education_in_India","abstract":"Outcome Based Education is one of the most significant developments in Indian engineering education in recent years. Outcome based approach is a shift of teaching learning paradigm from teacher centric to student centric. Outcome based education has been practiced worldwide since nineteen nineties, In India adoption of OBE was a result of signing Washington Accord. The National Board of Accreditation (NBA), apex body for monitoring quality of engineering education in India has made it mandatory as a part of accreditation. The positive results of implementing OBE in engineering education are inevitable but whether the faculty members are prepared to implement the strategy is the question to be answered. This paper discusses the impact assessment OBE in the Indian engineering education. The study is carried out through a survey. The observations are encouraging, the concept of OBE in terms of curriculum design, delivery, assessment, evaluation and reflection is penetrating in the Engineering education in India but still trainings in certain aspects are required.","authors":["Maruti Jadhav","Anandrao B.
