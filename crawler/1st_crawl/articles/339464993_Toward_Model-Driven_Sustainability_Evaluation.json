{"id":"339464993_Toward_Model-Driven_Sustainability_Evaluation","abstract":"Sustainability—the capacity to endure—has emerged as a concern of central relevance for society. However, the nature of sustainability is distinct from other concerns addressed by computing research, such as automation, self-adaptation, or intelligent systems. It demands the consideration of environmental resources, economic prosperity, individual well being, social welfare, and the evolvability of technical systems. Thus, it requires a focus not just on productivity, effectiveness, and efficiency, but also the consideration of longer-term, cumulative, and systemic effects of technology interventions, as well as lateral side effects not foreseen at the time of implementation. Furthermore, sustainability includes normative elements and encompasses multi-disciplinary aspects and potentially diverging views. As a wicked problem (see the sidebar “Wicked Problems”), it challenges business-as-usual in many areas of engineering and computing research.","authors":["Jörg Kienzle","Gunter Mussbacher","Benoit Combemale","Lucy Bastin"],"meta":["February 2020Communications of the ACM 63(3):80-91","DOI:10.1145/3371906"],"references":["329844979_From_Big_Data_to_Knowledge_Issues_of_Provenance_Trust_and_Scientific_Computing_Integrity","322647930_Towards_an_OpenModelica-based_sensitivity_analysis_platform_including_optimization-driven_strategies","318040554_User_Experience_for_Model-Driven_Engineering_Challenges_and_Future_Directions","328505350_Constraint-based_run-time_state_migration_for_live_modeling","324626933_The_Electronic_Oracle_Computer_Models_and_Social_Decisions","324309241_Groping_in_the_Dark_The_First_Decade_of_Global_Modelling","322010218_Volunteered_Metadata_and_Metadata_on_VGI_Challenges_and_Current_Practices","321291364_Documenting_Social_Simulation_Models_The_ODD_Protocol_as_a_Standard","309775338_Sensor_Web_Enablement_SWE_for_citizen_science","308595323_Model-driven_engineering"]}
