We previously reported the clinical feasibility of computational modeling-guided AF catheter ablation.Methods\nWe randomly assigned 118 patients with persistent AF (77.8% men, age 60.8 ± 9.9 years) to the computational modeling-guided ablation group (53 patients) and the empirical ablation group (55 patients) based on the operators’ experience. For virtual ablation, four virtual linear and one electrogram-guided lesion sets were tested on patient heart computed tomogram-based models, and the lesion set with the fastest termination time was reported to the operator in the modeling-guided ablation group. The primary outcome was freedom from atrial tachyarrhythmias lasting longer than 30 s after a single procedure.ResultsDuring 31.5 ± 9.4 months, virtual ablation procedures were available in 95.2% of the patients (108/118). Clinical recurrence rate was significantly lower after a modeling-guided ablation than after an empirical ablation (20.8 vs. 40.0%, log-rank p = 0.042). Modeling-guided ablation was independently associated with a better long-term rhythm outcome of persistent AF ablation (HR = 0.29 [0.12–0.69], p = 0.005). The rhythm outcome of the modeling-guided ablation showed better trends in males, non-obese patients with a less remodeled atrium (left atrial dimension < 50 mm), ejection fraction ≥ 50%, and those without hypertension or diabetes (p < 0.01). There were no significant differences between the groups for the total procedure time (p = 0.403), ablation time (p = 0.510), and major complication rate (p = 0.900).Conclusion\nAmong patients with persistent AF, the computational modeling-guided ablation was superior to the empirical catheter ablation regarding the rhythm outcome.Clinical Trial RegistrationThis study was registered with the ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02171364.","authors":["In-Soo Kim","Byounghyun Lim","Jaemin Shim","Minki Hwang"],"meta":["December 2019Frontiers in Physiology 10:1512","DOI:10.3389/fphys.2019.01512"],"references":["328684525_Electroanatomical_Remodeling_of_the_Atria_in_Obesity","322864086_Catheter_Ablation_for_Atrial_Fibrillation_with_Heart_Failure","322142823_Effectiveness_of_atrial_fibrillation_rotor_ablation_is_dependent_on_conduction_velocity_An_in-silico_3-dimensional_modeling_study","320325525_Virtual_In-Silico_Modeling_Guided_Catheter_Ablation_Predicts_Effective_Linear_Ablation_Lesion_Set_for_Longstanding_Persistent_Atrial_Fibrillation_Multicenter_Prospective_Randomized_Study","309022959_Maintenance_of_Atrial_Fibrillation_Are_Reentrant_Drivers_With_Spatial_Stability_the_Key","309019475_Challenging_Achievement_of_Bidirectional_Block_After_Linear_Ablation_Affects_the_Rhythm_Outcome_in_Patients_With_Persistent_Atrial_Fibrillation","301281015_Myofiber_Architecture_of_the_Human_Atria_as_Revealed_by_Submillimeter_Diffusion_Tensor_Imaging","295891955_Electrophysiological_Rotor_Ablation_in_In-Silico_Modeling_of_Atrial_Fibrillation_Comparisons_with_Dominant_Frequency_Shannon_Entropy_and_Phase_Singularity","323598044_Pro-arrhythmogenic_effects_of_heterogeneous_tissue_curvature_Role_of_left_atrial_appendage_in_atrial_fibrillation","321631605_Personalized_Imaging_and_Modeling_Strategies_for_Arrhythmia_Prevention_and_Therapy"]}
