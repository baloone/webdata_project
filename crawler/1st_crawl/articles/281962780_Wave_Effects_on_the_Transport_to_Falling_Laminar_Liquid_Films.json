{"id":"281962780_Wave_Effects_on_the_Transport_to_Falling_Laminar_Liquid_Films","abstract":"Existing data for the transport to falling liquid films are reviewed to show the effect of augmented transport by surface waves in the cases of heating of the film, absorption by the film from the surrounding gas, and evaporation from the film. It is shown that, while the effect of the waves can be partially rationalized, the nature of the waves themselves is not known exactly enough to provide a consistent specification for all of the available data.","authors":["R.A.
