{"id":"335056781_CornerNet_Detecting_Objects_as_Paired_Keypoints","abstract":"We propose CornerNet, a new approach to object detection where we detect an object bounding box as a pair of keypoints, the top-left corner and the bottom-right corner, using a single convolution neural network. By detecting objects as paired keypoints, we eliminate the need for designing a set of anchor boxes commonly used in prior single-stage detectors. In addition to our novel formulation, we introduce corner pooling, a new type of pooling layer that helps the network better localize corners. Experiments show that CornerNet achieves a 42.2% AP on MS COCO, outperforming all existing one-stage detectors.","authors":["Hei Law","Jia Deng"],"meta":["March 2020International Journal of Computer Vision 128(1)","DOI:10.1007/s11263-019-01204-1"],"references":["329747829_Improving_Object_Localization_with_Fitness_NMS_and_Bounded_IoU_Loss","329745476_Cascade_R-CNN_Delving_Into_High_Quality_Object_Detection","329740973_Feature_Selective_Networks_for_Object_Detection","329740280_An_Analysis_of_Scale_Invariance_in_Object_Detection_-_SNIP","329488196_R-fcn_Object_detection_via_region-based_fully_convolutional_networks","328142654_Acquisition_of_Localization_Confidence_for_Accurate_Object_Detection_15th_European_Conference_Munich_Germany_September_8-14_2018_Proceedings_Part_XIV","326566753_Focal_Loss_for_Dense_Object_Detection","322060561_CoupleNet_Coupling_Global_Structure_with_Local_Parts_for_Object_Detection","322059652_DSOD_Learning_Deeply_Supervised_Object_Detectors_from_Scratch","322059369_Focal_Loss_for_Dense_Object_Detection","321511551_Learning_Object_Detectors_from_Scratch_with_Gated_Recurrent_Feature_Pyramids","322058378_DeNet_Scalable_Real-Time_Object_Detection_with_Directed_Sparse_Sampling","322058119_Soft-NMS_-_Improving_Object_Detection_with_One_Line_of_Code","321665770_Deep_Regionlets_for_Object_Detection","321512547_Cascade_R-CNN_Delving_into_High_Quality_Object_Detection"]}
