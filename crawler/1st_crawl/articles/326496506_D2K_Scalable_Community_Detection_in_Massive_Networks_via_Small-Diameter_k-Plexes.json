{"id":"326496506_D2K_Scalable_Community_Detection_in_Massive_Networks_via_Small-Diameter_k-Plexes","abstract":"This paper studies k-plexes, a well known pseudo-clique model for network communities. In a k-plex, each node can miss at most k-1 links. Our goal is to detect large communities in today's real-world graphs which can have hundreds of millions of edges. While many have tried, this task has been elusive so far due to its computationally challenging nature: k-plexes and other pseudo-cliques are harder to find and more numerous than cliques, a well known hard problem. We present D2K, which is the first algorithm able to find large k-plexes of very large graphs in just a few minutes. The good performance of our algorithm follows from a combination of graph-theoretical concepts, careful algorithm engineering and a high-performance implementation. In particular, we exploit the low degeneracy of real-world graphs, and the fact that large enough k-plexes have diameter 2. We validate a sequential and a parallel/distributed implementation of D2K on real graphs with up to half a billion edges.","authors":["Alessio Conte","Tiziano De Matteis","Daniele De Sensi","Roberto Grossi"],"meta":["July 2018","DOI:10.1145/3219819.3220093","Conference: the 24th ACM SIGKDD International Conference"],"references":["308273789_A_fast_and_complete_algorithm_for_enumerating_pseudo-cliques_in_large_graphs","303496669_Finding_All_Maximal_Cliques_in_Very_Large_Social_Networks","266262521_Querying_K-Truss_Community_in_Large_and_Dynamic_Graphs","318915539_Fast_Enumeration_of_Large_k-Plexes","315536050_Parallelizing_maximal_clique_and_k-plex_enumeration_over_graph_data","313061622_Finding_all_cliques_of_an_undirected_graph_algorithm_457","312600697_Algorithm_457_Finding_all_cliques_of_an_undirected_graph","300590376_Efficient_Enumeration_of_Maximal_k-Plexes","283188421_Distributed_Maximal_Clique_Computation_and_Management","262241326_Denser_than_the_densest_subgraph_Extracting_optimal_quasi-cliques_with_quality_guarantees"]}
