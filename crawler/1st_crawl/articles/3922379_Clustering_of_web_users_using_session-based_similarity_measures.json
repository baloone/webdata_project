{"id":"3922379_Clustering_of_web_users_using_session-based_similarity_measures","abstract":"One important research topic in web usage mining is the clustering\nof web users based on their common properties. Informative knowledge\nobtained from web user clusters were used for many applications, such as\nthe prefetching of pages between web clients and proxies. This paper\npresents an approach for measuring similarity of interests among web\nusers from their past access behaviors. The similarity measures are\nbased on the user sessions extracted from the user's access logs. A\nmulti-level scheme for clustering a large number of web users is\nproposed, as an extension to the method proposed in our previous work\n(2001). Experiments were conducted and the results obtained show that\nour clustering method is capable of clustering web users with similar\ninterests","authors":["Jitian Xiao","Yanchun Zhang"],"meta":["February 2001","DOI:10.1109/ICCNMC.2001.962600","SourceIEEE Xplore","Conference: Computer Networks and Mobile Computing, 2001.
