{"id":"306222126_Color_image_segmentation_using_kohonen_self-organizing_map_SOM","abstract":"Color image segmentation using Kohonen Self-Organizing Map (SOM), is proposed in this study. RGB color space is used as input in the process of clustering by SOM. Measurement of the distance between weight vector and input vector in learning and recognition stages in SOM method, uses Normalized Euclidean Distance. Then, the validity of clustering result is tested by Davies-Bouldin Index (DBI) and Validity Measure (VM) to determine the most optimal number of cluster. The clustering result, according to the most optimal number of cluster, then is processed with spatial operations. Spatial operations are used to eliminate noise and small regions which are formed from the clustering result. This system allows segmentation process become automatic and unsupervised. The segmentation results are close to human perception.","authors":["I.K. Ariana","Rukmi Hartati","I.K.G.D.
