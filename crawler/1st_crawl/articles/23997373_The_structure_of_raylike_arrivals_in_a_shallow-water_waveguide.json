{"id":"23997373_The_structure_of_raylike_arrivals_in_a_shallow-water_waveguide","abstract":"Acoustic remote sensing of the oceans requires a detailed understanding of the acoustic forward problem. The results of a shallow-water transmission experiment between a vertical array of sources and a vertical array of receivers are reported. The source array is used to provide additional degrees of freedom to isolate and track raylike arrivals by beamforming over both source and receiver arrays. The coordinated source-receiver array processing procedure is presented and its effectiveness in an example of tracking raylike arrivals in a fluctuating ocean environment is shown. Many of these arrivals can be tracked over an hour or more and show slowly varying amplitude and phase. The use of a double-beamforming algorithm lays the foundation for shallow-water acoustic remote sensing using travel time and source and receive angles of selected eigenrays.","authors":["Philippe Roux","Bruce D Cornuelle","W A Kuperman","W S Hodgkiss"],"meta":["January 2009The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America 124(6):3430-9","DOI:10.1121/1.2996330","SourcePubMed","Project: Ocean acoustic tomography in shallow water"],"references":["259598381_Iterative_time_reversal_in_the_ocean","252895777_Phase_conjugation_in_the_ocean_Experimental_demonstration_of_an_acoustic_time-reversal_mirror","243766811_A_long-range_and_variable_focus_phase-conjugation_experiment_in_shallow_water","228931279_A_nonreciprocal_implementation_of_time_reversal_in_the_ocean","228903330_Spatial_resolution_of_time-reversal_arrays_in_shallow_water","243526208_Travel-time_sensitivity_kernels_in_ocean_acoustic_tomography","243525451_Turning_point_filters_Analysis_of_sound_propagation_on_a_gyre-scale","242448626_Acoustic_travel-time_perturbations_due_to_shallow-water_internal_waves_and_internal_tides_in_the_Barents_Sea_Polar_Front_Theory_and_experiment","239291835_A_higher-order_energy-conserving_parabolic_equation_for_range-dependent_ocean_depth_sound_speed_and_density","238989864_A_subarray_approach_to_matched-field_processing"]}
