{"id":"323557624_Estimating_unstable_poles_in_simulations_of_microwave_circuits","abstract":"Abstract--- The impedance of a microwave circuit has an infinite number of poles due to the distributed elements. This complicates locating those poles with a rational approximation. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to locate the unstable poles of a circuit with distributed elements. The proposed method exploits the fact that a realistic circuit can only have a finite number of unstable poles. We first determine the unstable part whose poles coincide with the unstable poles of the circuit. A rational approximation of the unstable part is used to estimate the unstable poles.","authors":["Adam Cooman","Fabien Seyfert","Smain Amari"],"meta":["June 2018","DOI:10.1109/MWSYM.2018.8439335","Conference: International Microwave Symposium 2018At: Philadelphia","Project: Local Stability Analysis of microwave circuits"],"references":["309008608_Model-Free_Closed-Loop_Stability_Analysis_A_Linear_Functional_Approach","278630229_On_Transfer_Functions_Realizable_with_Active_Electronic_Components","228695943_Vectorized_adaptive_quadrature_in_MATLAB","323970308_Analytic_curve_frequency-sweeping_stability_tests_for_systems_with_commensurate_delays","314352328_Analytic_Curve_Frequency-Sweeping_Stability_Tests_for_Systems_with_Commensurate_Delays","311532382_Stability_analysis_and_demonstration_of_an_X-band_GaN_power_amplifier_MMIC","245262999_All_Optimal_Hankel-Norm_Approximations_of_Linear_Multivariable_Systems_and_Their_L-Error_Bounds","224342961_Stability_Analysis_of_Oscillation_Modes_in_Quadruple-Push_and_Rucker's_Oscillators","224342305_Complete_and_Systematic_Simulation_Tools_for_Frequency_Divider_Design","224240951_Systematic_Approach_to_the_Stabilization_of_Multitransistor_Circuits","3322946_Qualitative_analysis_of_the_dynamics_of_the_time-delayed_Chua's_circuit","3383308_Closed-loop_stability_analysis_of_microwave_amplifiers","3131166_Global_stability_analysis_and_stabilization_of_a_class-EF_amplifier_with_a_distributed_active_transformer","2315331_Spurious_Poles_in_Pade_Approximation"]}
