{"id":"234412529_Throughput_Optimizing_Localized_Link_Scheduling_for_Multihop_WirelessNetworks_Under_Physical_Interference_Model","abstract":"We study throughput-optimum localized link scheduling in wireless networks.\nThe majority of results on link scheduling assume binary interference models\nthat simplify interference constraints in actual wireless communication. While\nthe physical interference model reflects the physical reality more precisely,\nthe problem becomes notoriously harder under the physical interference model.\nThere have been just a few existing results on link scheduling under the\nphysical interference model, and even fewer on more practical distributed or\nlocalized scheduling. In this paper, we tackle the challenges of localized link\nscheduling posed by the complex physical interference constraints. By\ncooperating the partition and shifting strategies into the pick-and-compare\nscheme, we present a class of localized scheduling algorithms with provable\nthroughput guarantee subject to physical interference constraints. The\nalgorithm in the linear power setting is the first localized algorithm that\nachieves at least a constant fraction of the optimal capacity region subject to\nphysical interference constraints. The algorithm in the uniform power setting\nis the first localized algorithm with a logarithmic approximation ratio to the\noptimal solution. Our extensive simulation results demonstrate correctness and\nperformance efficiency of our algorithms.","authors":["Yaqin Zhou","Xiangyang Li","Min Liu","Xufei Mao"],"meta":["January 2013IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems 25(10)","DOI:10.1109/TPDS.2013.210","SourcearXiv"],"references":["248088223_Throughput_and_fairness_guar-antees_through_maximal_scheduling_in_multihop_wireless_networks","224565057_Low_Complexity_Stable_Link_Scheduling_for_Maximizing_Throughput_in_Wireless_Networks","224500544_Novel_Architectures_and_Algorithms_for_Delay_Reduction_in_Back-Pressure_Scheduling_and_Routing","224500426_Capacity_of_Arbitrary_Wireless_Networks","221628596_Longest-queue-first_scheduling_under_SINR_interference_model","221628472_Complexity_in_geometric_SINR","221595844_Maximizing_throughput_in_wireless_networks_via_gossip","221453575_DSS_Distributed_SINR-Based_Scheduling_Algorithm_for_Multihop_Wireless_Networks","221245677_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Computing_Capacity_of_Wireless_Networks_with_SINR_Constraints","221242659_Understanding_the_Capacity_Region_of_the_Greedy_Maximal_Scheduling_Algorithm_in_Multi-Hop_Wireless_Networks","221242118_A_Unified_Approach_to_Optimizing_Performance_in_Networks_Serving_Heterogeneous_Flows","221241703_Performance_of_Random_Access_Scheduling_Schemes_in_Multi-Hop_Wireless_Networks","220898070_Wireless_Communication_Is_in_APX","220429235_A_Unified_Approach_to_Optimizing_Performance_in_Networks_Serving_Heterogeneous_Flows","47696471_On_the_Complexity_of_Scheduling_in_Wireless_Networks","311702569_Stability_properties_of_constrained_queueing_systems_and_scheduling_policies_for_maximum_throughput_in_multihop_radio_networks","307767637_On_the_Complexity_of_Scheduling_in_Wireless_Networks","260353151_Multicast_Capacity_of_Wireless_Ad_Hoc_Networks","254031916_Distributed_link_scheduling_for_throughput_maximization_under_physical_interference_model","247900448_The_impact_of_imperfect_schedulin_g_on_cross-layer_rate_control_in_multihop_wireless_networks","239593861_Distributed_Computing_A_Locality-Sensitive_Approach","234828217_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Wireless_Link_Scheduling_With_SINR-Based_Interference","234784871_A_constant_approximation_algorithm_for_link_scheduling_in_arbitrary_networks_under_physical_interference_model","224700044_Constant-Time_Distributed_Scheduling_Policies_for_Ad_Hoc_Wireless_Networks","224466598_Distributed_Link_Scheduling_With_Constant_Overhead","224384611_Constant-Time_Distributed_Scheduling_Policies_for_Ad_Hoc_Wireless_Networks","224257911_Efficient_Scheduling_for_Periodic_Aggregation_Queries_in_Multihop_Sensor_Networks","224244051_Wireless_link_scheduling_under_physical_interference_model","224219336_Shortest_Link_Scheduling_with_Power_Control_under_Physical_Interference_Model","224091801_Passive_Diagnosis_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","222580452_Simple_approximation_algorithms_and_PTASs_for_various_problems_in_wireless_ad_hoc_networks","221628659_A_local_greedy_scheduling_scheme_with_provable_performance_guarantee","221628500_Topology_control_meets_SINR_The_scheduling_complexity_of_arbitrary_topologies","221628469_Delay_and_effective_throughput_of_wireless_scheduling_in_heavy_traffic_regimes_Vacation_model_for_complexity","221245982_The_Impact_of_Imperfect_Scheduling_on_Cross-Layer_Rate_Control_in_Wireless_Networks","221245346_The_Complexity_of_Connectivity_in_Wireless_Networks","220926539_Computationally_efficient_scheduling_with_the_physical_interference_model_for_throughput_improvement_in_wireless_mesh_networks","220926361_Multicast_capacity_for_large_scale_wireless_ad_Hoc_networks","220799050_Maximum_Independent_Set_of_Links_under_Physical_Interference_Model","220798886_Maximum_Weighted_Independent_Set_of_Links_under_Physical_Interference_Model","220655048_Network_Optimization_and_Control","220443065_Underground_Coal_Mine_Monitoring_with_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","220429923_On_Optimal_SINR-Based_Scheduling_in_Multihop_Wireless_Networks","220429702_Passive_Diagnosis_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","220429690_Low-Complexity_Distributed_Scheduling_Algorithms_for_Wireless_Networks","220429225_Multicast_capacity_of_wireless_ad_hoc_networks","220428755_Understanding_the_Capacity_Region_of_the_Greedy_Maximal_Scheduling_Algorithm_in_Multihop_Wireless_Networks","4365071_The_SCREAM_Approach_for_Efficient_Distributed_Scheduling_with_Physical_Interference_in_Wireless_Mesh_Networks","4334238_Cluster-Based_Back-Pressure_Routing_Algorithm","3737371_Linear_complexity_algorithms_for_maximum_throughput_in_radio_networks_and_input_queued_switches","3086711_Throughput_and_Fairness_Guarantees_Through_Maximal_Scheduling_in_Wireless_Networks","3021245_Stability_Properties_of_Constrained_Queueing_Systems_and_Scheduling_Policies_for_Maximum_Throughput_in_Multihop_Radio_Networks"]}
