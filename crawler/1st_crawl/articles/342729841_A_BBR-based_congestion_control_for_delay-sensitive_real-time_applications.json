{"id":"342729841_A_BBR-based_congestion_control_for_delay-sensitive_real-time_applications","abstract":"The current User Datagram Protocol (UDP) causes unfairness and bufferbloats to delay sensitive applications due to the uncontrolled congestion and monopolization of available bandwidth.This causes call drops and frequent communication/connection loss in delay sensitive applications such as VoIP. We present a Responsive Control Protocol using Bottleneck Bandwidth and Round trip propagation time (RCP-BBR) as an alternate solution to UDP. RCP-BBR achieves low latency, high throughput, and low call drops ratio by efficiently customizing Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) Bottleneck Bandwidth and Round-trip propagation time (TCP-BBR) congestion control. We conducted comprehensive experiments, and the results show that proposed protocol achieves better throughput over UDP in stable networks. Moreover, in unstable and long-distanced networks, RCP-BBR achieved smaller queues in deep buffers and lower delays as compared to UDP, which performed poorly by keeping delays above the call drop threshold.","authors":["Sayed Najmuddin","Muhammad Asim","Kashif Munir","Thar Baker"],"meta":["December 2020Computing 102(1)","DOI:10.1007/s00607-020-00829-2","Project: Network"],"references":["321260656_Experimental_evaluation_of_BBR_congestion_control","311847299_Simulated_performance_of_TCP_SCTP_DCCP_and_UDP_protocols_over_4G_network","332676103_Towards_a_Deeper_Understanding_of_TCP_BBR_Congestion_Control","326724946_Research_impacting_the_practice_of_congestion_control","325097710_Evaluation_of_multimedia_streams_in_internet_applications","323154172_EQ_A_QoE-Centric_Rate_Control_Mechanism_for_VoIP_Calls","322515625_Performance_Analysis_of_WLANs_with_Heterogeneous_and_Bursty_Multimedia_Traffic","314868524_International_Telecommunications_Demand","314767117_Comparison_of_High_Speed_Congestion_Control_Protocols","312640731_BBR_Congestion-based_congestion_control","265519242_TCP_over_Large_Buffers_When_Adding_Traffic_Improves_Latency","261134127_PIE_A_lightweight_control_scheme_to_address_the_bufferbloat_problem","241630402_Profiling_Skype_video_calls_Rate_control_and_video_quality","289004044_Introduction_to_Network_Simulator_2_NS2","267264014_Voice_over_TCP_and_UDP"]}
