{"id":"2827653_A_Dynamic_Survey_of_Graph_Labeling","abstract":"A vertex labeling of a graph G is an assignment f of labels to the vertices of G that induces for each edge xy a label depending on the vertex labels f(x) and f(y). The two best known labeling methods are called graceful and harmonious labelings. A function f is called a graceful labeling of a graph G with q edges if f is an injection from the vertices of G to the set {0, 1, . . . , q} such that, when each edge xy is assigned the label |f(x) - f(y)|, the resulting edge labels are distinct. A function f is called a harmonious labeling of a graph G with q edges if it is an injection from the vertices of G to the group of integers modulo q such that when each edge xy is assigned the label f(x)+f(y) (mod q), the resulting edge labels are distinct. When G is a tree, exactly one label may be used on two vertices. Over the past three decades many variations of graceful and harmonious labelings have evolved and about 300 papers have been written on the subject of graph labeling....","authors":["Joseph A Gallian"],"meta":["November 2000The Electronic Journal of Combinatorics 19"],"references":["290485423_Some_sigma_labelled_graphs_I","290158070_More_classes_of_H-supermagic_graphs","302236236_On_the_gracefulness_of_gear_graphs","291143841_Gracefulness_of_union_of_twopath_graphs_with_grid_graph_and_complete_bipartite_graph","291135272_Some_classes_of_graceful_graphs","285742397_On_magic_graphs","285433153_Two_new_a_d-antimagic_graph_labelings","285343603_On_the_cordiality_of_certain_specific_graphs","284690971_Problem_25_theory_of_graphs_and_its_applications_Proc_Symp_Smolence_1963","268852140_Cordial_labellings_of_the_Cartesian_product_and_composition_of_graphs","268841564_Cordial_labellings_of_unicyclic_graphs_and_generalized_Petersen_graphs","268826268_On_graceful_graphs_Cycles_with_3-consecutive_chords","268755556_Sur_Un_Probleme_Combinatoire_D'Antennes_En_Radioastronomie_II","268716980_On_cordialness_of_regular_windmill_graphs","268645816_On_graceful_digraphs_and_a_problem_in_network_addressing"]}
