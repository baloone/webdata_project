{"id":"262300605_Broadcasting_System_Compliant_with_MPEG-24_IPMPX","abstract":"In this paper, we present an intellectual property\nmanagement and protection (IPMP) system in a\nbroadcasting environment to provide mechanisms for\ncopyright and contents protection that are compliant with\nthe MPEG-2 and MPEG-4 IPMP Extension (IPMPX)\nspecifications. The technology for processing IPMP related\ninformation was exploited, and a terminal model has been\nsuccessfully designed and implemented. In addition,\ninteroperability, which is the main objective of MPEG-2/4\nIPMPX, has been addressed in detail. The experimental\nresults show that the implemented system performs the\nIPMP process well, meeting the requirements of a\nbroadcasting environment.","authors":["Yongju Cho","Jongwon Seok","Jinwoo Hong","Chieteuk Ahn"],"meta":["April 2004Etri Journal 26(2):83-91"],"references":["251075298_A_Novel_Audio_Watermarking_Algorithm_for_Copyright_Protection_of_Digital_Audio","238566585_Video_watermarking_system_using_selection_and_overlapping_of_region_by_features_of_consecutive_frames"]}
