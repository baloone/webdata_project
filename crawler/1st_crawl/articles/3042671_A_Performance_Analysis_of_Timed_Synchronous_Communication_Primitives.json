{"id":"3042671_A_Performance_Analysis_of_Timed_Synchronous_Communication_Primitives","abstract":"The performance of two algorithms for timed synchronous\ncommunication between a single sender and a single receiver is analyzed.\nEach weakens the definition of correct timed synchronous communication\nin a different way, and exhibits a different undesirable behavior. Their\nsensitivity to various parameters is discussed. These parameters include\nhow long the processes are willing to wait for communication to be\nsuccessful, how well synchronized the processes are, the assumed upper\nbound on message delay, and the actual end-to-end message delay\ndistribution. The fault tolerance of the algorithms is discussed and a\nmixed strategy is proposed that avoids some of the performance problems","authors":["Insup Lee","Susan Davidson"],"meta":["October 1990IEEE Transactions on Computers 39(9):1117 - 1131","DOI:10.1109/12.57054","SourceIEEE Xplore"],"references":["260585604_Timing_Issues_in_the_Distributed_Execution_of_Ada_Programs","226488797_Notes_on_Data_Base_Operating_Systems","222611919_Distribution_of_end-to-end_delay_in_message-switched_networks","221621885_Notes_on_Data_Base_Operating_Systems","221298791_Imprecise_Results_Utilizing_Partial_Comptuations_in_Real-Time_Systems","220329686_Adding_Time_to_Synchronous_Process_Communications","45597839_Partial_Computation_in_Real-Time_Database_Systems","32206662_Language_Constructs_for_Distributed_Real-Time_Programming","32206271_Motivating_Time_as_a_First_Class_Entity"]}
