{"id":"216792879_Backpropagation_Applied_to_Handwritten_Zip_Code_Recognition","abstract":"The ability of learning networks to generalize can be greatly enhanced by providing constraints from the task domain. This paper demonstrates how such constraints can be integrated into a backpropagation network through the architecture of the network. This approach has been successfully applied to the recognition of handwritten zip code digits provided by the U.S. Postal Service. A single network learns the entire recognition operation, going from the normalized image of the character to the final classification.","authors":["Yann Lecun","Bernhard E.
