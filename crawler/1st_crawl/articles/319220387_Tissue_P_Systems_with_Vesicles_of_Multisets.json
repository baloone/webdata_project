{"id":"319220387_Tissue_P_Systems_with_Vesicles_of_Multisets","abstract":"We consider tissue P systems working on vesicles of multisets with the very simple operations of insertion, deletion, and substitution of single objects. With the whole multiset being enclosed in a vesicle, sending it to a target cell can be indicated in those simple rules working on the multiset. As derivation modes we consider the sequential mode, where exactly one rule is applied in a derivation step, and the set maximal mode, where in each derivation step a non-extendable set of rules is applied. With the set maximal mode, computational completeness can already be obtained with tissue P systems having a tree structure, whereas tissue P systems even with an arbitrary communication structure are not computationally complete when working in the sequential mode. Adding polarizations (-1, 0, 1 are sufficient) allows for obtaining computational completeness even for tissue P systems working in the sequential mode.","authors":["Artiom Alhazov","Rudolf Freund","Sergiu Ivanov","Sergey Verlan"],"meta":["August 2017","DOI:10.4204/EPTCS.252.6"],"references":["313806055_P_Systems_Working_in_Maximal_Variants_of_the_Set_Derivation_Mode","292076603_Computational_completeness_of_complete_star-like_and_linear_hybrid_networks_of_evolutionary_processors_with_a_small_number_of_processors","262572647_Generating_and_Accepting_P_Systems_with_Minimal_Left_and_Right_Insertion_and_Deletion","256441559_How_to_Obtain_Computational_Completeness_in_P_Systems_with_One_Catalyst","318144464_Computational_Completeness_of_Networks_of_Evolutionary_Processors_with_Elementary_Polarizations_and_a_Small_Number_of_Processors","303795696_On_the_computational_power_of_networks_of_polarized_evolutionary_processors","264915272_Networks_of_Polarized_Evolutionary_Processors_Are_Computationally_Complete","234807858_Computation_Finite_and_Infinite_Machines","228764973_Matrix_languages_register_machines_vector_addition_systems","221426789_A_New_Class_of_Symbolic_Abstract_Neural_Nets_Tissue_P_Systems"]}
