{"id":"326634329_K-means_properties_on_six_clustering_benchmark_datasets","abstract":"This paper has two contributions. First, we introduce a clustering basic benchmark. Second, we study the performance of k-means using this benchmark. Specifically, we measure how the performance depends on four factors: (1) overlap of clusters, (2) number of clusters, (3) dimensionality, and (4) unbalance of cluster sizes. The results show that overlap is critical, and that k-means starts to work effectively when the overlap reaches 4% level. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","authors":["Pasi Fränti","Sami Sieranoja"],"meta":["December 2018Applied Intelligence 48(2)","DOI:10.1007/s10489-018-1238-7"],"references":["330397332_Fast_Approximate_Spectral_Clustering","324152730_Efficiency_of_random_swap_clustering","318635851_Feature_clustering_based_support_vector_machine_recursive_feature_elimination_for_gene_selection","308020680_The_k-means_clustering_technique_General_considerations_and_implementation_in_Mathematica","307792780_A_PTAS_For_The_k-Consensus_Structures_Problem_Under_Squared_Euclidean_Distance","325081220_Random_Projection_for_k-means_Clustering","322276906_Adaptive_Control_Processes_A_Guided_Tour","310509349_XNN_Graph","310403387_A_K-means_clustering_algorithm","309715704_Least_squares_quantization_in_PCM","307534542_Algorithm_AS_136_A_K-means_vlustering_algorithm","299976000_Set_Matching_Measures_for_External_Cluster_Validity","294920971_The_Variance_of_the_Adjusted_Rand_Index","289684691_Exploring_the_uniform_effect_of_FCM_clustering_A_data_distribution_perspective","288942058_A_clustering_technique_for_summarizing_multivariate_data"]}
