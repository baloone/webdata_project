{"id":"292188121_Clustering_Data_Streams_Based_on_Shared_Density_Between_Micro-Clusters","abstract":"As more and more applications produce streaming data, clustering data streams has become an important technique for data and knowledge engineering. A typical approach is to summarize the data stream in real-time with an online process into a large number of so called micro-clusters. Micro-clusters represent local density estimates by aggregating the information of many data points in a defined area. On demand, a (modified) conventional clustering algorithm is used in a second offline step to recluster the microclusters into larger final clusters. For reclustering, the centers of the micro-clusters are used as pseudo points with the density estimates used as their weights. However, information about density in the area between micro-clusters is not preserved in the online process and reclustering is based on possibly inaccurate assumptions about the distribution of data within and between micro-clusters (e.g., uniform or Gaussian). This paper describes DBSTREAM, the first micro-cluster-based online clustering component that explicitly captures the density between micro-clusters via a shared density graph. The density information in this graph is then exploited for reclustering based on actual density between adjacent micro-clusters. We discuss the space and time complexity of maintaining the shared density graph. Experiments on a wide range of synthetic and real data sets highlight that using shared density improves clustering quality over other popular data stream clustering methods which require the creation of a larger number of smaller microclusters to achieve comparable results.","authors":["Michael Hahsler","Matthew Bolanos"],"meta":["June 2016IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering 28(6):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TKDE.2016.2522412"],"references":["299970682_Efficient_Online_Evaluation_of_Big_Data_Stream_Classifiers","258442502_LeaDen-Stream_A_Leader_Density-Based_Clustering_Algorithm_over_Evolving_Data_Stream","257132178_Data_Stream_Clustering_A_Survey","255566858_SOStream_Self_Organizing_Density-Based_Clustering_over_Data_Stream","242620986_A_Geometric_Framework_for_Unsupervised_Anomaly_Detection_Detecting_Intrusions_in_Unlabeled_Data","236007649_On_evaluating_stream_learning_algorithms","229124762_Data_Streams_Models_and_Algorithms","228751217_A_new_shared_nearest_neighbor_clustering_algorithm_and_its_applications","221653945_An_effective_evaluation_measure_for_clustering_on_evolving_data_streams","221571035_E-Stream_Evolution-Based_Technique_for_Stream_Clustering","221461051_Visualising_the_Cluster_Structure_of_Data_Streams","220907290_Temporal_Structure_Learning_for_Clustering_Massive_Data_Streams_in_Real-Time","220906738_Density-Based_Clustering_over_an_Evolving_Data_Stream_with_Noise","220765056_Unsupervised_Clustering_In_Streaming_Data","46957856_Sphere_Packings_Lattices_and_Groups","44326491_MOA_massive_online_analysis","2955136_CHAMELEON_A_hierarchical_clustering_algorithm_using_dynamic_modeling","303166622_On_evaluating_stream_learning_algorithms","272705428_Clustering_Algorithms","267147759_Knowledge_Discovery_from_Data_Streams_Data_Mining_and_Knowledge_Discovery","236391953_Survey_of_techniques_for_fixed_radius_near_neighbor_searching","232642010_Clustering_data_streams_theory_and_practice_IEEE_Trans_Knowl_Data_Eng","232254255_Essentials_of_the_self-organizing_map","224839879_Quick_Clustering_Algorithms","222029218_The_self-organizing_map","221669764_Self-organised_formation_of_topologically_correct_feature_map","221653977_A_Density-Based_Algorithm_for_Discovering_Clusters_in_Large_Spatial_Databases_with_Noise","221653130_Density-based_clustering_for_real-time_stream_data","221310982_A_Framework_for_Projected_Clustering_of_High_Dimensional_Data_Streams","221310440_A_Framework_for_Clustering_Evolving_Data_Streams","220695912_Algorithms_for_Clustering_Data","220571575_Knowledge_discovery_from_data_streams","220345123_Density-Based_Clustering_of_Data_Streams_at_Multiple_Resolutions","220345102_Stream_Data_Clustering_Based_on_Grid_Density_and_Attraction","220283749_The_ClusTree_Indexing_micro-clusters_for_anytime_stream_mining","30867879_Multidimensional_Binary_Search_Trees_Used_for_Associative_Searching","30012937_An_Efficient_Approach_to_Clustering_in_Large_Multimedia_Databases_with_Noise","3880912_Clustering_data_streams"]}
