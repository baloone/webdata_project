{"id":"319475257_STEADI_CDC's_approach_to_make_older_adult_fall_prevention_part_of_every_primary_care_practice","abstract":"Introduction\nPrimary care providers play a critical role in protecting older adult patients from one of the biggest threats to their health and independenceâ€”falls. A fall among an older adult patient cannot only be fatal or cause a devastating injury, but can also lead to problems that can effect a patient's overall quality of life.\n\nMethods\nIn response, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) developed the STEADI initiative to give health care providers the tools they need to help reduce their older adult patient's risk of a fall.\n\nResults\nCDC's STEADI resources have been distributed widely and include practical materials and tools for health care providers and their patients that are designed to be integrated into every primary care practice.\n\nConclusion\nAs the population ages, the need for fall prevention efforts, such as CDC's STEADI, will become increasingly critical to safeguard the health of Americans.\n\nPractical applications\nSTEADI's electronic health records (EHRs), online trainings, assessment tools, and patient education materials are available at no-cost and can be downloaded online at www.cdc.gov/STEADI. Health care providers should look for opportunities to integrate STEADI materials into their practice, using a team-based approach, to help protect their older patients.","authors":["Kelly Sarmiento","Robin Lee"],"meta":["September 2017Journal of Safety Research 63","DOI:10.1016/j.jsr.2017.08.003"],"references":["308523139_Falls_and_Fall_Injuries_Among_Adults_Aged_65_Years_-_United_States_2014","278110834_Summary_of_the_Updated_American_Geriatrics_SocietyBritish_Geriatrics_Society_Clinical_Practice_Guideline_for_Prevention_of_Falls_in_Older_Persons","262534065_Trends_in_Electronic_Health_Record_System_Use_Among_Office-based_Physicians_United_States_2007-2012","226146972_How_Do_Physicians_Conduct_Medication_Reviews","13128551_The_Transtheoretical_Model_of_Health_Behavior_Change","11587628_Epidemiology_of_Falls","6862466_Falls_in_Older_People_Epidemiology_Risk_Factors_and_Strategies_for_Prevention","6827452_Falls_and_Their_Prevention_in_Elderly_People_What_Does_the_Evidence_Show","304035977_Chronic_Disease_Management_What_Will_It_Take_to_Improve_Care_for_Chronic_Illness","303634076_The_direct_costs_of_fatal_and_non-fatal_falls_among_older_adults_-_United_States","301734224_Lessons_Learned_from_Implementing_CDC's_STEADi_Falls_Prevention_Algorithm_in_Primary_Care","278358627_Medication_Therapy_Management_in_community_pharmacy_practice_Core_elements_of_an_MTM_service_version_10","233537364_Development_of_STEADI_A_Fall_Prevention_Resource_for_Health_Care_Providers","230842931_Interventions_for_Preventing_Falls_in_Older_People_Living_in_the_Community","8370156_Detection_and_Management_of_Falls_and_Instability_in_Vulnerable_Elders_by_Community_Physicians","8370155_Fall-Risk_Assessment_and_Management_in_Clinical_Practice_Views_from_Healthcare_Providers","7432342_Perceptions_of_Physicians_on_the_Barriers_and_Facilitators_to_Integrating_Fall_Risk_Evaluation_and_Management_Into_Practice"]}
