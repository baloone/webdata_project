{"id":"282375850_Query_Interaction_Based_Approach_for_Horizontal_Data_Partitioning","abstract":"With the explosion of data, several applications are designed around analytical aspects, with data warehousing technology at the heart of the construction chain. The exploitation of this data warehouse is usually performed by the use of complex queries involving selections, joins and aggregations. These queries bring the following characteristics: (1) their routinely aspects, (2) their large number, and (3) the high operation sharing between queries. This interaction has been largely identified in the context of multi-query optimization, where graph data structures were proposed to capture it. Also during the physical design, the structures have been used to select redundant optimization structures such as materialized views and indexes. Horizontal data partitioning (HDP) is another non-redundant optimization structure that can be selected in the physical design phase. It is a pre-condition for designing extremely large databases in several environments: centralized, distributed, parallel and cloud. It aims to reduce the cost of the above operations. In HDP, the optimization space of potential candidates for partitioning grows exponentially with the problem size making the problem NP-hard. This paper proposes a new approach based on query interactions to select a partitioning schema of a data warehouse in a divide and conquer manner to achieve an improved trade-off between the optimization algorithm's speed and the quality of the solution. The effectiveness of our approach is proven through a validation using the Star Schema Benchmark (100 GB) on Oracle11g.","authors":["Ladjel Bellatreche","Kerkad Amira"],"meta":["April 2015International Journal of Data Warehousing and Mining 11(2):44-61","DOI:10.4018/ijdwm.2015040103"],"references":["221310508_Multi-Dimensional_Database_Allocation_for_Parallel_Data_Warehouses","221212923_Materialized_View_Selection_and_Maintenance_Using_Multi-Query_Optimization","220613742_A_Survey_of_Parallel_and_Distributed_Data_Warehouses","220613702_Referential_Horizontal_Partitioning_Selection_Problem_in_Data_Warehouses_Hardness_Study_and_Selection_Algorithms","220538659_Sharing-Aware_Horizontal_Partitioning_for_Exploiting_Correlations_During_Query_Processing","220538629_Scalable_Multi-Query_Optimization_for_Exploratory_Queries_over_Federated_Scientific_Databases","220482236_Materialized_View_Selection_and_Maintenance_Using_Multi-Query_Optimization","51949641_View_Selection_in_Semantic_Web_Databases","45869309_Enhancing_XML_Data_Warehouse_Query_Performance_by_Fragmentation","30512343_De_la_conception_physique_aux_outils_d'administration_et_de_tuning_des_entrepots_de_donnees","3943297_Multiple_Query_Optimization_by_Cache-Aware_Middleware_using_Query_Teamwork","3296161_On_the_multiple-query_optimization_problem","2598345_Algorithms_for_Materialized_View_Design_in_Data_Warehousing_Environment","281015816_L'interaction_au_service_de_l'optimisation_a_grande_echelle_des_entrepots_de_donnees_relationnels","256001747_A_Query_Beehive_Algorithm_for_Data_Warehouse_Buffer_Management_and_Query_Scheduling","254042684_Scalable_multi-query_optimization_for_SPARQL","221309640_Self-Tuning_Database_Systems_A_Decade_of_Progress","221214412_Integrating_Vertical_and_Horizontal_Partitioning_Into_Automated_Physical_Database_Design","221213264_Horizontal_Data_Partitioning_in_Database_Design","221212935_Query_interactions_in_database_workloads","220988185_Relational_Cloud_A_Database-as-a-Service_for_the_Cloud","220967230_Hive_-_A_Petabyte_Scale_Data_Warehouse_Using_Hadoop","220538353_Schism_a_Workload-Driven_Approach_to_Database_Replication_and_Partitioning","220473652_Interaction-aware_scheduling_of_report_generation_workloads","220225268_Multiple-Query_Optimization","4331046_Dynamic_Materialization_of_Query_Views_for_Data_Warehouse_Workloads","4330987_Optimizing_Star_Join_Queries_for_Data_Warehousing_in_Microsoft_SQL_Server","4080342_AutoPart_automating_schema_design_for_large_scientific_databases_using_data_partitioning","3686713_Physical_database_design_for_data_warehouses","3496553_Queries_in_object-oriented_databases","3297361_Selection_of_views_to_materialize_in_a_data_warehouse","1961525_Efficient_and_Extensible_Algorithms_for_Multi_Query_Optimization"]}
