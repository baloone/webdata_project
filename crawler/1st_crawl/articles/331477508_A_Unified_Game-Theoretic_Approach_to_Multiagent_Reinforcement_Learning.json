{"id":"331477508_A_Unified_Game-Theoretic_Approach_to_Multiagent_Reinforcement_Learning","abstract":"To achieve general intelligence, agents must learn how to interact with others in a shared environment: this is the challenge of multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL). The simplest form is independent reinforcement learning (InRL), where each agent treats its experience as part of its (non-stationary) environment. In this paper, we first observe that policies learned using InRL can overfit to the other agentsâ€™ policies during training, failing to sufficiently generalize duringn execution. We introduce a new metric, joint-policy correlation, to quantify this effect. We describe an algorithm for general MARL, based on approximate best responses to mixtures of policies generated using deep reinforcement learning, and empirical game-theoretic analysis to compute meta-strategies for policy selection. The algorithm generalizes previous ones such as InRL, iterated best response, double oracle, and fictitious play. Then, we present a scalable implementation which reduces the memory requirement using decoupled meta-solvers. Finally, we demonstrate the generality of the resulting policies in two partially observable settings: gridworld coordination games and poker.","authors":["Marc Lanctot","V Zambaldi","A Gruslys","Angeliki Lazaridou"],"meta":["December 2017","Conference: 31st Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), 4-9 December 2017, Long Beach, CA, USAVolume: 31"],"references":["320821388_A_Unified_Game-Theoretic_Approach_to_Multiagent_Reinforcement_Learning","317586634_Coordinate_to_Cooperate_or_Compete_Abstract_goals_and_joint_intentions_in_social_interaction","312331109_How_evolution_learns_to_generalise_Using_the_principles_of_learning_theory_to_understand_the_evolution_of_developmental_organisation","310440792_Reinforcement_Learning_with_Unsupervised_Auxiliary_Tasks","303859091_Safe_and_Efficient_Off-Policy_Reinforcement_Learning","301926326_Using_Reinforcement_Learning_to_Validate_Empirical_Game-Theoretic_Analysis_A_Continuous_Double_Auction_Study","292074166_Mastering_the_game_of_Go_with_deep_neural_networks_and_tree_search","285270566_Multiagent_Cooperation_and_Competition_with_Deep_Reinforcement_Learning","280919379_Evolutionary_Dynamics_of_Multi-Agent_Learning_A_Survey","277411157_Deep_Learning","266378318_Using_Double-oracle_Method_and_Serialized_Alpha-Beta_Search_for_Pruning_in_Simultaneous_Move_Games","260621908_Coevolving_Game-Playing_Agents_Measuring_Performance_and_Intransitivities","255962423_Theoretical_advantages_of_lenient_learners_An_evolutionary_game_theoretic_perspective","255739006_Multiagent_Learning_Basics_Challenges_and_Prospects","236340610_Efficient_Evolutionary_Dynamics_with_Extensive-Form_Games","231890516_Independent_reinforcement_learners_in_cooperative_Markov_games_A_survey_regarding_coordination_problems","320640959_Heads-up_limit_Hold'em_Poker_is_solved","320321556_Continuous_Adaptation_via_Meta-Learning_in_Nonstationary_and_Competitive_Environments","317399486_Multi-Agent_Actor-Critic_for_Mixed_Cooperative-Competitive_Environments","316779789_Safe_and_Nested_Subgame_Solving_for_Imperfect-Information_Games","316184689_The_Reactor_A_Sample-Efficient_Actor-Critic_Architecture","314433751_Model-Agnostic_Meta-Learning_for_Fast_Adaptation_of_Deep_Networks","313650896_Multi-agent_Reinforcement_Learning_in_Sequential_Social_Dilemmas","313569257_Regret_minimization_in_games_with_incomplete_information","312157307_DeepStack_Expert-Level_Artificial_Intelligence_in_No-Limit_Poker","309117155_Rock_Paper_StarCraft_Strategy_Selection_in_Real-Time_Strategy_Games","301841754_Deep_Reinforcement_Learning_from_Self-Play_in_Imperfect-Information_Games","299836655_Algorithms_for_Computing_Strategies_in_Two-Player_Simultaneous_Move_Games","281822418_Economic_reasoning_and_artificial_intelligence","277411158_Reinforcement_learning_improves_behaviour_from_evaluative_feedback","277257251_A_Framework_for_Sequential_Planning_in_Multi-Agent_Settings","276395436_Fictitious_Self-Play_in_Extensive-Form_Games","272837232_Human-level_control_through_deep_reinforcement_learning","272161307_Reinforcement_Learning_An_Introduction","269935079_Adam_A_Method_for_Stochastic_Optimization","261404388_Scalable_Planning_and_Learning_for_Multiagent_POMDPs","260192013_Further_Developments_of_Extensive-Form_Replicator_Dynamics_using_the_Sequence-Form_Representation","250379371_Learning_Regret_Minimization_and_Equilibria","243767969_Evolutionary_Stable_Strategies_and_Game_Dynamics","243653793_Iterative_solution_of_games_by_fictitious_play","241623233_Safe_Opponent_Exploitation","238684354_Algorithms_for_abstracting_and_solving_imperfect_information_games_Thesis_Proposal","238162251_A_Reinforcement_Procedure_Leading_to_Correlated_Equilibrium","236589342_Regret_Minimization_in_Non-Zero-Sum_Games_with_Applications_to_Building_Champion_Multiplayer_Computer_Poker_Agents","229331654_An_evolutionary_game-theoretic_analysis_of_poker_strategies","228108094_Extensive_Games_and_the_Problem_if_Information","224836765_Regret_Analysis_of_Stochastic_and_Nonstochastic_Multi-armed_BanditProblems","222675630_If_multi-agent_learning_is_the_answer_what_is_the_question","222526120_Multiagent_Learning_Using_a_Variable_Learning_Rate","222409777_Generalised_weakened_fictitious_play","221603967_Beyond_Equilibrium_Predicting_Human_Behavior_in_Normal-Form_Games","221606716_Methods_for_Empirical_Game-Theoretic_Analysis","221604912_A_New_Algorithm_for_Generating_Equilibria_in_Massive_Zero-Sum_Games","221604899_Understanding_the_Success_of_Perfect_Information_Monte_Carlo_Sampling_in_Game_Tree_Search","221499155_Gambling_in_a_Rigged_Casino_The_Adversarial_Multi-Arm_Bandit_Problem"]}
