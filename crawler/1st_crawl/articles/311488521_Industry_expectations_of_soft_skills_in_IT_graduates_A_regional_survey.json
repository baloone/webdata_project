{"id":"311488521_Industry_expectations_of_soft_skills_in_IT_graduates_A_regional_survey","abstract":"Representatives of the Information Technology (IT) industry periodically question the work-readiness of university educated IT graduates. Academics typically interpret such challenges as calls to teach currently fashionable technologies. Strong demand for IT skills in Wellington, New Zealand's capital, during the past few years has resulted in this being a major area of debate. This research sought to get past the competing claims by examining job advertisements, conducting interviews and focus groups research and found that industry representatives are in fact less concerned about technical skills than 'soft' skills needed for team based, customer focused, business environments. Industry tends to seek base-level technical skills and make recruitment decisions on more personal qualities, leaving detailed training to on-the-job. Key soft skills sought by IT employers are identified to help tertiary educators clarify industry priorities.","authors":["Matt Stevens","Richard Norman"],"meta":["February 2016","DOI:10.1145/2843043.2843068","Conference: The Australasian Computer Science Week Multiconference","Project: Work Integrated Learning"],"references":["312068210_Best_Practice_Guidelines_for_Effective_Industry_Engagement_in_Australian_Engineering_Degrees","292654388_Modern_societies_as_knowledge_societies","266596534_Australian_engineering_academe_a_snapshot_of_demographics_and_attitudes","265672130_The_Managed_University_the_PBRF_its_impacts_and_staff_attitudes","248987688_A_Warm_Embrace_New_Zealand_Universities_and_the_Knowledge-based_Economy","281324865_Issues_and_challenges_of_accounting_education_in_China_practitioner_and_academic_perceptions","280152161_Engineering_for_a_Changing_Road_A_Roadmap_to_the_Future_of_Engineering_Practice_Research_and_Education","275172702_The_Scholarship_of_Teaching_from_Scholarship_Reconsidered_Priorities_of_the_Professoriate","262679308_Who_should_teach_what_Perceptions_of_the_roles_of_universities_and_practice_in_the_education_of_professional_accountants","247925242_The_Mythical_Man-month"]}
