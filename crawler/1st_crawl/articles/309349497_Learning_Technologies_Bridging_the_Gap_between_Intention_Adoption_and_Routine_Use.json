{"id":"309349497_Learning_Technologies_Bridging_the_Gap_between_Intention_Adoption_and_Routine_Use","abstract":"Substantial funds are invested in developing educational technologies with the goal that faculty members adopt and routinely use these technologies. This research establishes that there is a gap between the development and widespread adoption/use of these technologies. This paper investigates (1) which critical success factors (CSF) influence faculty members to adopt and routinely use technologies, and (2) whether the CSFs moderate the adoption process. Based on surveys of 335 computer science and electrical engineering faculty members, the research findings pinpoint the factors that influence the adoption and routine use of educational technologies. These results can be used by developers of educational technologies to create and establish plans to increase faculty awareness of and create positive attitudes towards the technologies.","authors":["David Bourrie","L.A.
