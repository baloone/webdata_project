{"id":"321180551_Morphisms_of_Open_Games","abstract":"We define a notion of morphisms between open games, exploiting a surprising connection between lenses in computer science and compositional game theory. This extends the more intuitively obvious definition of globular morphisms as mappings between strategy profiles that preserve best responses, and hence in particular preserve Nash equilibria. We construct a symmetric monoidal double category in which the horizontal 1-cells are open games, vertical 1-morphisms are lenses, and 2-cells are morphisms of open games. States (morphisms out of the monoidal unit) in the vertical category give a flexible solution concept that includes both Nash and subgame perfect equilibria. Products in the vertical category give an external choice operator that is reminiscent of products in game semantics, and is useful in practical examples. We illustrate the above two features with a simple worked example from microeconomics, the market entry game.","authors":["Jules Hedges"],"meta":["November 2017Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science 341","DOI:10.1016/j.entcs.2018.11.008"],"references":["313919093_COMPOSITIONAL_GAME_THEORY","257380217_''Backward''_Coinduction_Nash_equilibrium_and_the_Rationality_of_Escalation","253064718_Sequential_games_and_optimal_strategies","324396684_Game_Theory","315836149_Coherence_for_lenses_and_open_games","315748377_Profunctor_Optics_Modular_Data_Accessors","308321922_The_Algebra_of_Open_and_Interconnected_Systems","283250401_Sequential_decision_problems_dependently_typed_solutions","268614879_Review_of_the_elements_of_2-categories","227466749_Microeconomic_Theory"]}
