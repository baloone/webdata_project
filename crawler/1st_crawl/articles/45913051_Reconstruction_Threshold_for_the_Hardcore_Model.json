{"id":"45913051_Reconstruction_Threshold_for_the_Hardcore_Model","abstract":"In this paper we consider the reconstruction problem on the tree for the\nhardcore model. We determine new bounds for the non-reconstruction regime on\nthe k-regular tree showing non-reconstruction when lambda < (ln\n2-o(1))ln^2(k)/(2 lnln(k)) improving the previous best bound of lambda < e-1.\nThis is almost tight as reconstruction is known to hold when lambda>\n(e+o(1))ln^2(k). We discuss the relationship for finding large independent sets\nin sparse random graphs and to the mixing time of Markov chains for sampling\nindependent sets on trees.","authors":["Nayantara Bhatnagar","Allan Sly","Prasad Tetali"],"meta":["April 2010","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-15369-3_33","SourcearXiv"],"references":["225703548_Glauber_Dynamics_on_Trees_Boundary_Conditions_and_Mixing_Time","221591080_Optimal_phylogenetic_reconstruction","220780493_Phase_Transition_for_the_Mixing_Time_of_the_Glauber_Dynamics_for_Coloring_Regular_Trees","24304845_Reconstruction_and_Clustering_in_Random_Constraint_Satisfaction_Problems","23949210_Mixing_Time_of_Critical_Ising_Model_on_Trees_is_Polynomial_in_the_Height","6268915_Gibbs_States_and_the_Set_of_Solutions_of_Random_Constraint_Satisfaction_Problems","2392143_Broadcasting_on_Trees_and_the_Ising_Model","2108379_Glauber_Dynamics_on_Trees_and_Hyperbolic_Graphs","2099361_Information_flow_on_trees","1900175_Reconstruction_for_Colorings_on_Trees","1848720_Reconstruction_on_Trees_and_Spin_Glass_Transition","321331258_Optimal_Phylogenetic_Reconstruction","316517224_Survey_Information_flow_on_trees","301848676_The_Kesten-Stigum_Reconstruction_Bound_Is_Tight_for_Roughly_Symmetric_Binary_Channels","267441795_Gibbs_Measures_and_Phase_Transitions","265333396_Gibbs_Measures_and_Phase_TransitionsBerlin_Walter_de_Gruyter","226205967_On_the_purity_of_limiting_Gibbs_state_for_the_Ising_model_on_the_Bethe_lattice","224678309_The_Kesten-Stigum_Reconstruction_Bound_Is_Tight_for_Roughly_Symmetric_Binary_Channels","221591420_Reconstruction_for_the_Potts_model","220780162_Fast_mixing_for_independent_sets_colorings_and_other_models_on_trees","220357927_Random_Regular_Graphs_Of_Non-Constant_Degree_Independence_And_Chromatic_Number","200101672_Inferring_Phylogenies","45868017_Phase_Transition_for_the_Mixing_Time_of_the_Glauber_Dynamics_for_Coloring_Regular_Trees","38365393_Additional_Limit_Theorems_for_Indecomposable_Multidimensional_Galton-Watson_Processes","38362769_Differential_Equations_for_Random_Processes_and_Random_Graphs","23417826_Reconstruction_of_symmetric_Potts_Models","2846038_A_Second_Threshold_for_the_Hard-core_Model_on_a_Bethe_Lattice","2475793_Robust_Reconstruction_on_Trees_is_Determined_By_the_Second_Eigenvalue","2387233_Reconstruction_on_Trees_Beating_the_Second_Eigenvalue","2113428_Survey_Information_flow_on_trees","2107223_Reconstruction_Thresholds_on_Regular_Trees","1915177_Algorithmic_Barriers_from_Phase_Transitions","1912380_Reconstruction_of_Random_Colourings"]}
