{"id":"284219213_Sparse_learning_of_maximum_likelihood_model_for_optimization_of_complex_loss_function","abstract":"Traditional machine learning methods usually minimize a simple loss function\nto learn a predictive model, and then use a complex performance measure to\nmeasure the prediction performance. However, minimizing a simple loss function\ncannot guarantee that an optimal performance. In this paper, we study the\nproblem of optimizing the complex performance measure directly to obtain a\npredictive model. We proposed to construct a maximum likelihood model for this\nproblem, and to learn the model parameter, we minimize a com- plex loss\nfunction corresponding to the desired complex performance measure. To optimize\nthe loss function, we approximate the upper bound of the complex loss. We also\npropose impose the sparsity to the model parameter to obtain a sparse model. An\nobjective is constructed by combining the upper bound of the loss function and\nthe sparsity of the model parameter, and we develop an iterative algorithm to\nminimize it by using the fast iterative shrinkage- thresholding algorithm\nframework. The experiments on optimization on three different complex\nperformance measures, including F-score, receiver operating characteristic\ncurve, and recall precision curve break even point, over three real-world\napplications, aircraft event recognition of civil aviation safety, in- trusion\ndetection in wireless mesh networks, and image classification, show the\nadvantages of the proposed method over state-of-the-art methods.","authors":["Ning Zhang","Prathamesh Chandrasekar"],"meta":["May 2017Neural Computing and Applications 28(5)","DOI:10.1007/s00521-015-2118-2","SourcearXiv"],"references":["283864143_JOMR_Multi-join_optimizer_technique_to_enhance_map-reduce_job","281290421_How_to_read_a_receiver_operating_characteristic_curve","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","304292849_Multiple_Kernel_Multivariate_Performance_Learning_Using_Cutting_Plane_Algorithm","291221267_Precision-Recall-Optimization_in_Learning_Vector_Quantization_Classifiers_for_Improved_Medical_Classification_Systems","286725365_An_Effective_Image_Representation_Method_Using_Kernel_Classification","282937506_Using_statistics_for_computing_joins_with_map_reduce","282199996_Handling_Big_Data_Efficiently_by_Using_Map_Reduce_Technique","282189219_Scalable_multidimensional_anonymization_algorithm_over_big_data_using_map_reduce_on_public_cloud","281312689_Multiple_kernel_multivariate_performance_learning_using_cutting_plane_algorithm","281145227_Supervised_learning_of_sparse_context_reconstruction_coefficients_for_data_representation_and_classification","281145045_Image_Tag_Completion_by_Local_Learning","281052384_Enabling_PrecisionRecall_Preferences_for_Semi-supervised_SVM_Training","280697354_Incremental_Support_Vector_Machine_Learning_Method_for_Aircraft_Event_Recognition","279633337_Representing_Data_by_Sparse_Combination_of_Contextual_Data_Points_for_Classification"]}
