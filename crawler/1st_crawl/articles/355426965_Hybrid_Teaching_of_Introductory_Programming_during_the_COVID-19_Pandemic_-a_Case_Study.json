{"id":"355426965_Hybrid_Teaching_of_Introductory_Programming_during_the_COVID-19_Pandemic_-a_Case_Study","abstract":"The paper presents a case study of teaching an introductory computer science programming class in a hybrid flexible mode at a liberal arts college during the COVID-19 pandemic. The hybrid teaching and learning model provides face-to-face learning to in-person students and simultaneously distance learning to remote learners. Asynchronous online learning tools have been adapted to aid the unconventional teaching approach. To better assess the effectiveness of student learning in the hybrid mode, an exit survey was conducted. The paper discusses participants’ responses regarding learning preferences and challenges faced in the hybrid learning mode.\n\nKeywords: Introductory programming, First-year undergraduate, remote learning, hybrid teaching","authors":["Muhammad Kabiru Usman"],"meta":["September 2021","DOI:10.14662/ijarer2021.300","Project: Hybrid Teaching of Introductory Programming during the COVID-19 Pandemic – a Case Study"],"references":["346149720_Teaching_and_learning_of_postgraduate_medical_physics_using_Internet-based_e-learning_during_the_COVID-19_pandemic_-_A_case_study_from_Malaysia","352202061_A_Course_Plan_for_Principles_of_IS_Programming_to_Withstand_COVID-19","350320158_Adjusting_to_the_new_normal_perspectives_from_an_introductory_programming_sequence_course","347581008_Switching_to_Stay_Home_Instruction_Impacts_of_the_Coronavirus_Pandemic_on_Learner_Performance_for_an_Introductory_Computer_Science_Course","346302290_A_Mixed-Methods_Evaluation_of_a_Hybrid_Course_Modality_to_Increase_Student_Engagement_and_Mastery_of_Course_Content_in_Undergraduate_Research_Methods_Classes","343757306_DavidsonTrue_Transitioning_to_Remote_Teaching_while_Maintaining_Our_Values_as_a_Liberal_Arts_College_during_the_COVID-19_Pandemic","343270836_Challenges_of_Teaching_Organic_Chemistry_during_COVID-19_Pandemic_at_a_Primarily_Undergraduate_Institution","343036998_Distance_Teaching_of_Organic_Chemistry_Tutorials_During_the_COVID-19_Pandemic_Focus_on_the_Use_of_Videos_and_Social_Media","342678555_Hybrid_Classroom_Designing_for_the_New_Normal_after_COVID-19_Pandemic"]}
