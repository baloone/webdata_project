{"id":"313581762_Advances_in_Architectural_Geometry_AAG_2016_Symposium","abstract":"The Advances in Architectural Geometry (AAG) symposia serve as a unique forum where developments in the design, analysis and fabrication of building geometry are presented. With participation of both academics and professionals from the fields of architecture, engineering, computer science and mathematics, each symposium aims to gather and present practical work and theoretical research that responds to contemporary design challenges and expands opportunities for architectural form. This report summarizes the AAG2016, the fifth edition of the symposia hosted by the Swiss National Centre of Competence in Research (NCCR) Digital Fabrication at ETH Zurich from 9 to 13 September 2016.","authors":["Orkun Kasap"],"meta":["February 2017Nexus Network Journal 19(1)","DOI:10.1007/s00004-017-0330-3","Project: Advances in Architectural Geometry (AAG) 2016 symposium"],"references":[]}
