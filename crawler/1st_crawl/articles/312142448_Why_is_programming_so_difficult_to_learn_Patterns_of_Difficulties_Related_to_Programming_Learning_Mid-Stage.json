{"id":"312142448_Why_is_programming_so_difficult_to_learn_Patterns_of_Difficulties_Related_to_Programming_Learning_Mid-Stage","abstract":"New software engineers and casual developers are needed in many different areas. However, students face many difficulties while learning the logic of computer programming, frequently failing in university courses. This Ph.D. research aims to identify difficulty patterns related to learning how to program, a crucial part of software engineers training. The research methodology comprises studies that put together results from a systematic literature review and empirical data collected from qualitative and quantitative studies. The difficulties identified will be compiled into a model, which may assist students in sharpening their focus, and teachers in preparing their lessons and teaching material, as well as researchers in employing methods and tools to support learning","authors":["Yorah Bosse","Marco Aurelio Gerosa"],"meta":["January 2017ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes 41(6):1-6","DOI:10.1145/3011286.3011301"],"references":["342288334_Reprovacoes_e_Trancamentos_nas_Disciplinas_de_Introducao_a_Programacao_da_Universidade_de_Sao_Paulo_Um_Estudo_Preliminar","339323002_Desenvolvimento_de_Objetos_de_Aprendizagem_para_o_Apoio_a_Disciplina_de_Algoritmos_e_Programacao","303296554_Learning_Agile_software_development_in_high_school_an_investigation","303099101_Overcoming_open_source_project_entry_barriers_with_a_portal_for_newcomers","346946476_Programming_web-course_analysis_How_to_introduce_computer_programming","321275099_Research_design_qualitative_quantitative_and_mixed_methods_approaches","317953655_Designing_and_conducting_mixed_methods_research","312915607_My_program_is_correct_but_it_doesn't_run_A_preliminary_investigation_of_novice_programmers'_problems","277815337_Designing_and_Conducting_Mixed_Method_Research","272177823_Grounded_Theory_Research_Procedures_Canons_and_Evaluative_Criteria"]}
