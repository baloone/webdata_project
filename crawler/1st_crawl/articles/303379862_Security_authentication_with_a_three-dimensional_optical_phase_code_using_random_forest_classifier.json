{"id":"303379862_Security_authentication_with_a_three-dimensional_optical_phase_code_using_random_forest_classifier","abstract":"An object with a unique three-dimensional (3D) optical phase mask attached is analyzed for security and authentication. These 3D optical phase masks are more difficult to duplicate or to have a mathematical formulation compared with 2D masks and thus have improved security capabilities. A quick response code was modulated using a random 3D optical phase mask generating a 3D optical phase code (OPC). Due to the scattering of light through the 3D OPC, a unique speckle pattern based on the materials and structure in the 3D optical phase mask is generated and recorded on a CCD device. Feature extraction is performed by calculating the mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis, and entropy for each recorded speckle pattern. The random forest classifier is used for authentication. Optical experiments demonstrate the feasibility of the authentication scheme.","authors":["Adam Markman","Artur Carnicer","Bahram Javidi"],"meta":["May 2016Journal of the Optical Society of America A 33(6):1160","DOI:10.1364/JOSAA.33.001160"],"references":["260523071_Photon-Counting_Security_Tagging_and_Verification_Using_Optically_Encoded_QR_Codes","258304769_Machine_Learning_Volume_45_Number_1_-_SpringerLink","3328584_Histogram_Approaches_for_Lossy_Compression_of_Digital_Holograms_of_Three-Dimensional_Objects"]}
