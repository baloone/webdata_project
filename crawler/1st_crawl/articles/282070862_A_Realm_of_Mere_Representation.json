{"id":"282070862_A_Realm_of_Mere_Representation","abstract":"This article addresses the proliferation of images and appearances in the realm of e-sports culture in urban China. The author’s findings are based upon ethnographic research and participant observation of e-sports audience members, teams, and tournaments, including the 2010 E-sports Champion League tournament in Beijing, the 2012 and 2013 World Cyber Games Festivals in Kunshan, and a 2014 Starcraft II tournament in Shanghai. A comparison of these events leads the author to argue that live e-sports events in China are less about spectatorship than they are about creating a spectacle that presents a carefully crafted vision of Chinese politics, nationalism, and capitalist consumer culture. In these cases, the participants and audience members are not only commodities to be sold but also a means of masking contradictory and highly ambivalent discourses about China’s role in technological production, digital game culture, and the promotion of the discourse of Internet addiction.","authors":["Marcella Szablewicz"],"meta":["July 2015Games and Culture 11(3)","DOI:10.1177/1555412015595298"],"references":["273947242_Gaming_Cultures_and_Place_in_Asia-Pacific","44292873_Just_Like_the_Qing_Empire_Internet_Addiction_MMOGs_and_Moral_Crisis_in_Contemporary_China","346473662_Media_Spectacle","344854086_Olympic_Dreams_China_and_Sports_1895-2008","290554156_The_fragility_of_Asian_national_identity_in_the_olympic_games","284439456_Training_the_Body_for_China_Sports_in_the_Moral_Order_of_the_People's_Republic","282888199_The_Politics_of_Online_Gaming","273946888_Raising_the_Stakes_E-Sports_and_the_Professionalization_of_Computer_Gaming","270638287_The_'losers'_of_China's_Internet_Memes_as_'structures_of_feeling'_for_disillusioned_young_netizens","269516284_Dependency_Road_Communications_Capitalism_Consciousness_and_Canada","265811214_Spectacles_of_Disintegration","258173665_Signs_of_meta-change_in_second_modernity_The_growth_of_e-sport_and_the_World_Cyber_Games","256599875_The_Society_of_Spectacle","240707948_The_realities_of_virtual_play_Video_games_and_their_industry_in_China","240285996_Age_of_New_Media_EmpiresA_Critical_Interpretation_of_the_Korean_Online_Game_Industry","233251231_Conceptualizing_an_East_Asian_Popular_Culture","233090563_Cheerleadersbooth_babes_Halo_hoes_Pro-gaming_gender_and_jobs_for_the_boys","232884867_The_ill_effects_of_opium_for_the_spirit_A_critical_cultural_analysis_of_China's_Internet_addiction_moral_panic","229672729_Spectacular_Productions_Community_and_Commodity_in_the_Beijing_Olympics","41024696_Patriotic_Professionalism_in_Urban_China_Fostering_Talent","26490751_Playing_at_being_mobile_Gaming_and_cute_culture_in_South_Korea","23539115_Beyond_the_Sunan_Model_Trajectory_and_Underlying_Factors_of_Development_in_Kunshan_China"]}
