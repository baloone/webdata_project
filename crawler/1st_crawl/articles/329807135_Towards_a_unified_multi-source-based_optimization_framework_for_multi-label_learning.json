{"id":"329807135_Towards_a_unified_multi-source-based_optimization_framework_for_multi-label_learning","abstract":"In the era of Big Data, a practical yet challenging task is to make learning techniques more universally applicable in dealing with the complex learning problem, such as multi-source multi-label learning. While some of the early work have developed many effective solutions for multi-label classification and multi-source fusion separately, in this paper we learn the two problems together, and propose a novel method for the joint learning of multiple class labels and data sources, in which an optimization framework is constructed to formulate the learning problem, and the result of multi-label classification is induced by the weighted combination of the decisions from multiple sources. The proposed method is responsive in exploiting the label correlations and fusing multi-source data, especially in the fusion of long-tail data. Experiments on various multi-source multi-label data sets reveal the advantages of the proposed method.","authors":["Jia Zhang","Candong Li","Zhenqiang Sun","Zhiming Luo"],"meta":["December 2018Applied Soft Computing 76","DOI:10.1016/j.asoc.2018.12.016"],"references":["296686853_Interactive_Machine_Learning_for_Health_Informatics_When_do_we_need_the_human-in-the-loop","273647495_Data_Fusion_by_Matrix_Factorization","270892701_Evolutionary_algorithms_for_de_novo_drug_design_-_A_survey","270337594_A_Tutorial_on_Multi-Label_Learning","263813673_A_Review_On_Multi-Label_Learning_Algorithms","262347545_Challenges_and_opportunities_with_big_data","256091285_Combining_Usage_and_Content_in_an_Online_Music_Recommendation_System_for_Music_in_the_Long-Tail","226649250_Random_k-Labelsets_An_Ensemble_Method_for_Multilabel_Classification","224135977_TagProp_Discriminative_Metric_Learning_in_Nearest_Neighbor_Models_for_Image_Auto-Annotation","221571875_Early_versus_late_fusion_in_semantic_video_analysis","221571327_Optimizing_multi-graph_learning_Towards_a_unified_video_annotation_scheme","221318735_Semantic_Combination_of_Textual_and_Visual_Information_in_Multimedia_Retrieval","220907300_Multi-label_Classification_without_the_Multi-label_Cost","220875947_Vocal_Minority_Versus_Silent_Majority_Discovering_the_Opionions_of_the_Long_Tail","220267215_Multi-modal_constraint_propagation_for_heterogeneous_image_clustering","41089425_A_side_effect_resource_to_capture_phenotypic_effects_of_drugs_Mol_Syst_Biol_6343","26268298_PubChem_A_public_information_system_for_analyzing_bioactivities_of_small_molecules_Nucleic_Acids_Research_37_W623-W633","8954995_The_Unified_Medical_Language_System_UMLS_Integrating_Biomedical_Terminology","5800366_DrugBank_a_knowledgebase_for_drugs_drug_actions_and_drug_targets_Nucleic_Acids_Res_36D901-D906","5598864_Support_vector_machines_for_histogram-based_image_classification","328557106_Mutual_information_based_multi-label_feature_selection_via_constrained_convex_optimization","326698626_Multi-label_feature_selection_with_application_to_TCM_state_identification","326182978_Multi-label_learning_with_label-specific_features_by_resolving_label_correlations","318333140_Multi-source_Homogeneous_Data_Clustering_for_Multi-target_Detection_from_Cluttered_Background_with_Misdetection","316727997_Computational_drug_repositioning_using_collaborative_filtering_via_multi-source_fusion","309056065_Learning_Label-Specific_Features_and_Class-Dependent_Labels_for_Multi-Label_Classification","308083780_Joint_Similar_and_Specific_Learning_for_Diabetes_Mellitus_and_Impaired_Glucose_Regulation_Detection","307881957_LIBSVM_A_library_for_support_vector_machines","306270546_Multi-Label_Feature_Selection_with_Streaming_Labels","286116664_Research_of_label-specific_features_on_multi-label_learning_algorithm","283646316_Multi-label_feature_selection_based_on_neighborhood_mutual_information","276465262_A_confidence-aware_approach_for_truth_discovery_on_long-tail_data","267554204_Multimodal_Learning_with_Deep_Boltzmann_Machines","260712604_Multi-Label_Learning_With_Fused_Multimodal_Bi-Relational_Graph","260325049_Data_Mining_with_Big_Data","257074416_Modern_bioinformatics_meets_traditional_Chinese_medicine","232624300_A_Decision-Theoretic_Framework_for_Numerical_Attribute_Value_Reconciliation","224260826_A_Graph-Based_Consensus_Maximization_Approach_for_Combining_Multiple_Supervised_and_Unsupervised_Models","222430151_Learning_multi-label_scene_classification","221318512_New_trends_and_ideas_in_visual_concept_detection_The_MIR_flickr_retrieval_evaluation_initiative","220344089_Multilabel_classification_via_calibrated_label_ranking","220215898_Latent_class_model_based_diagnostic_system_utilizing_traditional_Chinese_medicine_for_patients_with_systemic_lupus_erythematosus","220199356_Similarity_computing_model_of_high_dimension_data_for_symptom_classification_of_Chinese_traditional_medicine","1893485_Power-Law_Distributions_in_Empirical_Data"]}
