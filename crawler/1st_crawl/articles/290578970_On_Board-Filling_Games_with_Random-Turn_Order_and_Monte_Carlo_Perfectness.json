{"id":"290578970_On_Board-Filling_Games_with_Random-Turn_Order_and_Monte_Carlo_Perfectness","abstract":"In a game, pure Monte Carlo search with parameter T means that for each feasible move T random games are generated. The move with the best average score is played. We call a game “Monte Carlo perfect” when this straightforward procedure converges to perfect play for each position, when T goes to infinity. Many popular games like Go, Hex, and Amazons are NOT Monte Carlo perfect.\nIn this paper, two-player zero-sum games are investigated where the turn-order is random: always a fair coin flip decides which player acts in the next move. A whole class of such random-turn games is proven to be Monte Carlo perfect. The result and generalisations are discussed, with example games ranging from very abstract to very concrete.","authors":["Ingo Althöfer"],"meta":["January 2012","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-31866-5_22","Conference: Advances in Computer Games"],"references":["221112399_Bandit_Based_Monte-Carlo_Planning","2121953_Random-Turn_Hex_and_Other_Selection_Games","314751250_Monte_Carlo_Concepts_Algorithms_and_Applications","289942117_The_Dangers_of_Random_Playouts","268312154_Monte_Carlo_Concepts_Algorithms_and_Applications_Springer_Series_in_Operations_Research","257708817_Square_Making_a_connection_game_win-lose_complementary_and_playing-fair","257008050_Connection_Games_Variations_on_a_Theme","29648128_Efficient_Selectivity_and_Backup_Operators_in_Monte-Carlo_Tree_Search"]}
