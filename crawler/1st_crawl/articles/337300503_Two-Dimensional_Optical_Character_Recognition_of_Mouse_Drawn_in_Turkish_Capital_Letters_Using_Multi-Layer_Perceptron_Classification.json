{"id":"337300503_Two-Dimensional_Optical_Character_Recognition_of_Mouse_Drawn_in_Turkish_Capital_Letters_Using_Multi-Layer_Perceptron_Classification","abstract":"The Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is software for text recognition that takes an image containing text, to transform it into strings, then save them into a format that make it able to use in text editing programs. The OCR plays a significant role in the transformation of printed materials into digital text files. These digital files can be very useful for children and adults who have awkward reading. This is because a digital text can be used with computer programs that allow people to read them in different ways. In this paper, we developed system for Turkish character recognition under visual studio (C#) development environment, where machine learning is used to accurately predict optical characters, the reason why it has a high precision and high recognition speed through deep learning, which is one of the machine learning methods for OCR when drawing letters by mouse on the screen, then recognize by using back propagation algorithm.","authors":["Ehsan Ali Kareem","Maad M.
