{"id":"311849120_On_self-dual_double_negacirculant_codes","abstract":"Double negacirculant (DN) codes are the analogues in odd characteristic of\ndouble circulant codes. Self-dual DN are shown to have a transitive automor-\nphism group. Exact counting formulae are derived for DN codes. The special\nclass of length a power of two is studied by means of Dickson polynomials, and\nis shown to contain families of codes with relative distances satisfying a mod-\ni�ed Varshamov-Gilbert bound. This gives an alternative, and e�ective proof\nof the result of Chepyzhov, that there are families of quasi-twisted codes above\nVarshamov-Gilbert.","authors":["Buket Özkaya","Patrick Solé","Cem Güneri","Hatoon Shoaib"],"meta":["December 2016Discrete Applied Mathematics 222(6):205-212","DOI:10.1016/j.dam.2017.01.018","Project: Algebraic codes are good"],"references":["301841558_On_self-dual_double_circulant_codes","3080523_On_the_algebraic_structure_of_quasi-cyclic_codes_I_Finite_fields","2116699_Artin's_primitive_root_conjecture_-a_survey_-","2103190_Self-Dual_Codes","289406885_Constacyclic_and_Quasi-Twisted_Hermitian_Self-Dual_Codes_over_Finite_Fields","277895523_Quasi-Cyclic_Complementary_Dual_Code","265958934_Double_circulant_and_quasi-twisted_self-dual_codes_over_5_and_7","265570259_Artin's_Primitive_Root_Conjecture_-_A_Survey","265365745_An_ideal_structure_for_some_quasi-cyclic_error-correcting_codes","257481699_On_quasi-twisted_codes_over_finite_fields","243006379_Factorization_of_the_Cyclotomic_Polynomial_x_2_n_1_over_Finite_Fields","241050447_Good_Self-Dual_Quasi-Cyclic_Codes_over_F_q_q_Odd","238656246_Fundamentals_of_Error-Correcting_Codes","220397966_Extremal_Ternary_Self-Dual_Codes_Constructed_from_Negacirculant_Matrices","220246892_Some_Results_on_Quasi-Cyclic_Codes","220186368_Self-dual_doubly_circulant_codes","220161158_The_MAGMA_algebra_system_I_the_user_language","50333105_The_Theory_of_Groups","3085909_Some_randomized_code_constructions_from_group_actions","3084700_Good_self-dual_quasi-cyclic_codes_exist","3082431_A_Gilbert-Varshamov_bound_for_quasi-cycle_codes_of_rate_12_Corresp"]}
