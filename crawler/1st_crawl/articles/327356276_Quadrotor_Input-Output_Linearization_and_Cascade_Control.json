{"id":"327356276_Quadrotor_Input-Output_Linearization_and_Cascade_Control","abstract":"This work presents a new perspective regarding the input-output linearization of a quadrotor. There are several ways of linearizing a nonlinear system. Taylor's series gives the approximate behaviour around an equilibrium point. Another way popular in the literature, is to use the input-output linearization, this is the approach used in the present article. However, quadrotors have six degrees of freedom and usually, only four are actuated. Therefore, they fall into the partially actuated system category. Mark Spong showed that this kind of systems can be only partially linearized, either the controlled (collocated) or, under more restrictive conditions, the non-controlled (non-collocated) part of the system. In the standard case, there is a part of the system that is not linked directly to the control but to the controlled variables, the zero dynamics, with no impact on the output. In the case we study, the un-actuated part is linked in cascade with the actuated part, becoming indirectly actuated by the actuated variables and the control. The main contributions of this work are a new perspective on: (1) the input-output linearization of the attitude-height output ({φ,θ,ψ,z}) for a standard quadrotor. And for the yaw and position of a quadcopter ({ψ,x,y,z}) the input-output linearization we show that it can be done (2) if the quadcopter has the propeller axes tilted inward or (3) if the controlled variables {φ,θ} are used in a nonlinear map to control the indirectly controlled {x,y} variables. Results of simulations are presented.","authors":["Alejandro Malo Tamayo","Cesar Alejandro Villasenor Rios","Juan Manuel Ibarra-Zannatha","Santos Miguel Orozco-Soto"],"meta":["January 2018IFAC-PapersOnLine 51(13):437-442","DOI:10.1016/j.ifacol.2018.07.317"],"references":[]}
