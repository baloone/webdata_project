{"id":"277255608_Optimized_link_state_routing_protocol_OLSR","abstract":"This document describes the Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR)\nprotocol for mobile ad hoc networks. The protocol is an optimization\nof the classical link state algorithm tailored to the requirements of\na mobile wireless LAN. The key concept used in the protocol is that\nof multipoint relays (MPRs). MPRs are selected nodes which forward\nbroadcast messages during the flooding process. This technique\nsubstantially reduces the message overhead as compared to a classical\nflooding mechanism, where every node retransmits each message when it\nreceives the first copy of the message. In OLSR, link state\ninformation is generated only by nodes elected as MPRs. Thus, a\nsecond optimization is achieved by minimizing the number of control\nmessages flooded in the network. As a third optimization, an MPR\nnode may chose to report only links between itself and its MPR\nselectors. Hence, as contrary to the classic link state algorithm,\npartial link state information is distributed in the network. This\ninformation is then used for route calculation. OLSR provides\noptimal routes (in terms of number of hops). The protocol is\nparticularly suitable for large and dense networks as the technique\nof MPRs works well in this context.","authors":["Thomas Heide Clausen","Philippe Jacquet","Cedric Adjih","Anis Laouiti"],"meta":["January 2003","Project: OLSR - The Optimised Link State Routing Protocol (OLSR) for Mobile Ad hoc NETworks (MANETs)"],"references":[]}
