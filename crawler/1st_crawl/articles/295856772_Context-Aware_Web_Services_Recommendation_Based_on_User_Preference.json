{"id":"295856772_Context-Aware_Web_Services_Recommendation_Based_on_User_Preference","abstract":"Context-Aware Recommender System aims to\nrecommend items not only similar to those already rated with\nthe highest score, but also that could combine the contextual\ninformation with the recommendation process. Existing\ncontext-aware Web services recommendation methods directly\nuse context as a “filter” to discard services that may conflict\nwith the current user’s preference. However, the discarded\nservices may be valuable for another user or for the same user\nunder a new context, as one man’s trash may be another’s\ntreasure. We assume that failing to handle the contextual\nreasons behind the user preference may introduce inaccurate\nrecommendation, and even significant biases in\nrecommendation. In this work, we propose a novel method\ndubbed CASR-UP, which aims to exploit the contextual factors\nof the user preference to improve Quality of Service (QoS)\nprediction and services recommendation accuracy. Our\nmethod consists of three stages: 1) context-aware similarity\nmining to get the set of users having similar context with the\ncurrent user; 2) data filtering based on user preference in\ncurrent context so as to get the invocation records of the\nservices corresponding to the current user’s preference; 3)\nWeb services QoS prediction, recommendation and evaluation\nby Bayesian Inference. Experimental results on WS-Dream\ndataset is evaluated by both RMSE and MAE. The results\nshow the proposed method improves prediction accuracy and\noutperforms the compared methods.","authors":["Xiaoliang Fan","Yakun Hu","Ruisheng Zhang"],"meta":["December 2014","DOI:10.1109/APSCC.2014.20","Conference: 2014 Asia-Pacific Services Computing Conference (APSCC 2014)At: Fuzhou, China"],"references":["252068960_Tutorial_Recommender_Systems","235357340_Empirical_Analysis_of_Predictive_Algorithm_for_Collaborative_Filtering","322445232_What_we_talk_about_when_we_talk_about_populism","304494685_Probabilistic_matrix_factorization","284106719_Advances_in_neural_information_processing_systems_8","261486544_Selecting_Top-k_Composite_Web_Services_Using_Preference-Aware_Dominance_Relationship","261477730_Location-Aware_Collaborative_Filtering_for_QoS-Based_Service_Recommendation","261313204_Recommending_Web_Service_Based_on_User_Relationships_and_Preferences","261234513_Personalized_Services_Recommendation_Based_on_Context-Aware_QoS_Prediction","246980815_Notes_on_Formalizing_Context"]}
