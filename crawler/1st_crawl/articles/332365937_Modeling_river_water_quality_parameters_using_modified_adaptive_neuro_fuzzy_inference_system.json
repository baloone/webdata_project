{"id":"332365937_Modeling_river_water_quality_parameters_using_modified_adaptive_neuro_fuzzy_inference_system","abstract":"Water quality is always one of the most important factors in human health. Artificial intelligence models are respected methods for\nmodeling water quality. The evolutionary algorithm (EA) is a new technique for improving the performance of artificial intelligence models such as the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and artificial neural networks (ANN). Attempts have been made to make the models more suitable and accurate with the replacement of other training methods that do not suffer from some shortcomings, including a tendency to being trapped in local optima or voluminous computations. This study investigated the applicability of ANFIS with particle swarm optimization (PSO) and ant colony optimization for continuous domains (ACOR) in estimating water quality parameters at three stations along the Zayandehrood River, in Iran. The ANFIS-PSO and ANFIS-ACOR methods were also compared with the classic ANFIS method, which uses least squares and gradient descent as training algorithms. The estimated water quality parameters in this study were electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids\n(TDS), the sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), carbonate hardness (CH), and total hardness (TH). Correlation analysis was performed using SPSS software to determine the optimal inputs to the models. The analysis showed that ANFIS-PSO was the better model compared with ANFIS-ACOR. It is noteworthy that EA models can improve ANFISâ€™ performance at all three stations for different water quality parameters.","authors":["Armin Azad","Hojat Karami","Saeed Farzin","Sayed-Farhad Mousavi"],"meta":["April 2019Water Science and Engineering 12(1)","DOI:10.1016/j.wse.2018.11.001","Project: Prediction of hydrological and water quality parameters using different heuristic data-driven models"],"references":["329720280_Modeling_Groundwater_Quality_Parameters_Using_Hybrid_Neuro-Fuzzy_Methods","324229335_Cloud-Verhulst_hybrid_prediction_model_for_dam_deformation_under_uncertain_conditions","315369315_Drought_forecasting_using_ANFIS-_a_case_study_in_drought_prone_area_of_Vietnam","313645378_Multi-step_water_quality_forecasting_using_a_boosting_ensemble_multi-wavelet_extreme_learning_machine_model","330905379_Comparative_evaluation_of_intelligent_algorithms_to_improve_adaptive_neuro-fuzzy_inference_system_performance_in_precipitation_modelling","328124129_The_effect_of_vermiculite_and_quartz_in_porous_concrete_on_reducing_storm-runoff_pollution","319999369_Prediction_of_Water_Quality_Parameters_Using_ANFIS_Optimized_by_Intelligence_Algorithms_Case_Study_Gorganrood_River","317725946_Predicting_adoption_of_double_cropping_in_paddy_fields_of_northern_Iran_a_comparison_of_statistical_methods","317304015_Modelling_of_water_reserves_in_mineral_soils_with_different_retention_properties","314217623_Groundwater_quality_modeling_using_neuro-particle_swarm_optimization_and_neuro-differential_evolution_techniques"]}
