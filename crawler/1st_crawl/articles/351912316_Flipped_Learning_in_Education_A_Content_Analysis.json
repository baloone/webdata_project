{"id":"351912316_Flipped_Learning_in_Education_A_Content_Analysis","abstract":"The continuously progressive education system of the 21 st century requires the introduction of innovative teaching methodologies incorporating up-to-the-minute technology-oriented styles, which are capable of changing the traditional ways of conducting classes presenting teachers as the ultimate source of knowledge, with a new notion which considers teachers as facilitators and guiders in the world of information. A plethora of research has been conducted with respect to flipped learning, however, the number of research papers presenting content analysis is limited indicating the deficiency and lack of content analysis-based papers on Flipped Classroom in Education. Thus, to fill this gap in the literature, there is a demand for conducting a content analysis. In turn, the aim of this paper was to identify the importance and impact of the distributed documents on a Flipped Learning Model (FLM) in Education which was done by gathering data from the SCOPUS database with keywords ‘Flipped Classroom in Education’, within the range of ten years (2011-2020). All studies published in SCOPUS, were statistically analyzed and examined according to the year of publication, subject area, document type, country/territory, languages, source type, types of research and the research methods. It was found that the publications related to FLM in education had dramatically increased from the year 2011 to 2020. The findings of this study also highlighted the importance of FLM in education, especially in courses that require cognitive skills like social studies, medicine, and computer science.","authors":["Rustam Haidov","Hanife Bensen"],"meta":["May 2021Sustainable Multilingualism 18(1):111-139","DOI:10.2478/sm-2021-0006"],"references":["340350146_Comparing_student_achievement_in_traditional_learning_with_a_combination_of_blended_and_flipped_learning","340324603_Self-regulated_learning_the_effect_on_medical_student_learning_outcomes_in_a_flipped_classroom_environment","340067197_Use_of_the_flipped_classroom_to_design_creative_and_active_activities_in_the_field_of_computer_science","338808245_Physiology_education_for_intensive_care_medicine_residents_A_15-minute_interactive_peer-led_flipped_classroom_session","338600269_Active_and_Emerging_Methodologies_for_Ubiquitous_Education_Potentials_of_Flipped_Learning_and_Gamification","339604071_The_impact_of_flipped_classroom_andragogy_on_student_assessment_performance_and_perception_of_learning_experience_in_two_advanced_physiology_subjects","339510387_Toward_Finding_Online_Activity_Patterns_in_a_Flipped_Programming_Course","339510313_Improving_Student_Study_Choices_in_CS1_with_Gamification_and_Flipped_Classrooms","338765638_Flipped_classroom_in_English_language_teaching_a_systematic_review","338428480_Comparison_Study_of_Student's_Learning_Achievement_between_the_Flip_Classroom_with_and_without_Group_Management","338382672_Critical_Electrocardiogram_Curriculum_Setting_the_Standard_for_Flipped-Classroom_EKG_Instruction","337926469_Nonscientific_University_Students_Training_in_General_Science_Using_an_Active-Learning_Merged_Pedagogy_Gamification_in_a_Flipped_Classroom","337642097_Flipped_classroom_in_mathematics_instruction_Teachers'_perception","337139570_Students'perception_toward_flipped_classroom_learning","337191438_What_Twitter_Will_and_Will_Not_Do_Theorizing_About_Teachers'_Online_Professional_Communities"]}
