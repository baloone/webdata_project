{"id":"256253666_A_New_Discrete_Probability_Distribution_with_Integer_Support_on_-","abstract":"A new discrete probability distribution with integer support on (−∞, ∞) is proposed as a discrete analogue of the continuous logistic distribution. Some of its important distributional and reliability properties are established. Its relationship with some known distributions is discussed. Parameter estimation by maximum likelihood method is presented. Simulation is done to investigate properties of maximum likelihood estimators. Real life application of the proposed distribution as empirical model is considered by conducting a comparative data fitting with Skellam distribution, Kemp's discrete normal, Roy's discrete normal and discrete Laplace distribution.","authors":["Subrata Chakraborty"],"meta":["August 2013Communication in Statistics- Theory and Methods 45(2)","DOI:10.1080/03610926.2013.830743"],"references":["257923782_Characterization_of_Life_Distributions_Using_Log-odds_Rate_in_Discrete_Aging","255631488_Some_Aspects_of_Discrete_Hazard_Rate_Function_in_Telescopic_Families","239792955_A_new_discrete_distribution","233115135_The_discrete_Lindley_distribution_properties_and_applications","49623017_The_Discrete_Weibull_Distribution_An_Alternative_for_Correlated_Counts_with_Confirmation_for_Microbial_Counts_in_Water","265674507_Nonparametric_Goodness-of-Fit_Tests_for_Discrete_Null_Distributions","265362851_Some_Methods_for_Strengthening_The_Common_X2_Tests","263910213_REDEFINING_FAILURE_RATE_FUNCTION_FOR_DISCRETE_DISTRIBUTIONS","263759804_Discrete_Gamma_Distributions_Properties_and_Parameter_Estimations","256252791_A_New_Discrete_Distribution_Related_to_Generalized_Gamma_Distribution_and_It's_Properties","254283886_Some_Results_for_Discrete_Unimodality","250750607_A_discrete_inverse_Weibull_distribution_and_estimation_of_its_parameters","243044574_The_Discrete_Normal_Distribution","242797375_Approximate_MLE's_of_the_parameters_of_a_discrete_Weibull_distribution_with_type_I_censored_data","240924157_Discrete_Burr_and_discrete_Pareto_distributions","238799323_A_New_Discrete_Weibull_Distribution","227719079_Analysis_of_sports_data_using_bivariate_Poisson_models","225536552_Another_generalization_of_the_geometric_distribution","224581928_The_Discrete_Weibull_Distribution","222787892_Characterizations_of_a_discrete_normal_distribution","222260027_On_the_monotonic_properties_of_discrete_failure_rates","222238412_Classifications_of_discrete_lives","222010848_A_discrete_analogue_of_the_Laplace_distribution","221943388_Understanding_AIC_and_BIC_in_model_selection","42274671_The_frequency_distribution_of_the_difference_between_two_Poisson_variates_belonging_to_different_populations","33763362_Discrete_laplace_distributions","4749695_A_class_of_discrete_distributions_arising_from_difference_of_two_random_variables","3283772_A_new_defect_distribution_metrology_with_a_consistent_discrete_exponential_formula_and_is_applications","3152687_Discrete_Rayleigh_Distribution","3151484_On_Estimating_Parameters_in_a_Discrete_Weibull_Distribution"]}
