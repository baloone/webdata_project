{"id":"306243509_Drinking_water_contamination_and_treatment_techniques","abstract":"Water is of fundamental importance for life on earth. The synthesis and structure of cell constituents and transport of nutrients into the cells as well as body metabolism depend on water. The contaminations present in water disturb the spontaneity of the mechanism and result in long/short-term diseases. The probable contaminations and their possible routes are discussed in the present review. Continued research efforts result in some processes/technologies to remove the contaminations from water. The review includes concepts and potentialities of the technologies in a comprehensible form. It also includes some meaningful hybrid technologies and promising awaited technologies in coming years.","authors":["Saroj Sharma","Amit Bhattacharya"],"meta":["August 2016Applied Water Science 7(3)","DOI:10.1007/s13201-016-0455-7"],"references":["297903094_Cyanobacterial_toxins_Removal_during_drinking_water_treatment_and_human_risk_assessment","346678013_Gas_Separation_by_Adsorption_Processes","314037284_Essentials_of_Water_Systems_Design_in_the_Oil_Gas_and_Chemical_Processing_Industries","313601203_Water_Chemistry","312911150_The_Chemistry_of_Silica","304853020_Science_and_technology_for_water_purification_in_the_coming_decades","298023346_Environmental_Chemistry_of_Dyes_and_Pigments","295773683_Microbial_contamination_of_drinking_water_and_disease_outcomes_in_developing_regions","292472534_Fluoride_in_drinking-water","291800004_Contamination_of_drinking_water_by_arsenic_in_Bangladesh_A_public_health_emergency"]}
