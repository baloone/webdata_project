{"id":"221498269_Distance_Oracles_beyond_the_Thorup--Zwick_Bound","abstract":"We give the first improvement to the space/approximation trade-off of distance oracles since the seminal result of Thorup and Zwick [STOC'01]. For unweighted graphs, our distance oracle has size O(n5/3) = O(n1.66⋯) and, when queried about vertices at distance d, returns a path of length 2d + 1. For weighted graphs with m = n2/α edges, our distance oracle has size O(n2/3√α) and returns a factor 2 approximation. Based on a plausible conjecture about the hardness of set intersection queries, we show that a 2-approximate distance oracle requires space Ω̃(n2/√α). For unweighted graphs, this implies a Ω̃(n1.5) space lower bound to achieve approximation 2d + 1.","authors":["Mihai Patrascu","Liam Roditty"],"meta":["October 2010Foundations of Computer Science, 1975., 16th Annual Symposium on 43(1):815-823","DOI:10.1109/FOCS.2010.83","SourceDBLP","Conference: 51th Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, FOCS 2010, October 23-26, 2010, Las Vegas, Nevada, USA"],"references":["239321680_Approximate_Distance_Oracles_for_Unweighted_Graphs_in_Expected_On2_Time","234785685_New_constructions_of_a_b-spanners_and_purely_additive_spanners","225201527_Distance_Oracles_for_Unweighted_Graphs_Breaking_the_Quadratic_Barrier_with_Constant_Additive_Error","224678293_Ramsey_partitions_and_proximity_data_structures","221498316_Faster_Algorithms_for_Approximate_Distance_Oracles_and_All-Pairs_Small_Stretch_Paths","220452641_On_Sparse_Spanners_of_Weighted_Graphs","45921972_On_the_hardness_of_distance_oracle_for_sparse_graph","1958749_Ramsey_partitions_and_proximity_data_structures","234802032_1_eB_-spanner_constructions_for_general_graphs","228057622_All_Pairs_Almost_Shortest_Paths","221499080_Lower_Bounds_for_Additive_Spanners_Emulators_and_More","221498658_Distance_Oracles_for_Sparse_Graphs","221233845_Compact_Routing_in_Power-Law_Graphs","220779411_Spanners_and_emulators_with_sublinear_distance_errors","220618243_1_epsilonbeta-Spanner_Constructions_for_General_Graphs","4354712_Probabilistic_computations_Toward_a_unified_measure_of_complexity","4334194_Reducing_Maximum_Stretch_in_Compact_Routing","4102807_Compact_Routing_on_Internet-Like_Graphs","2935062_Approximate_Distance_Oracles","1959136_Time-Space_Trade-Offs_for_Predecessor_Search"]}
