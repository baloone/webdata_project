{"id":"231370516_An_MILP_Approach_to_Automated_Wet-Etch_Station_Scheduling","abstract":"Wet-etching in wafer fabrication is an automated process involving a complex interplay of mixed intermediate policies and material-handling constraints. Its operation poses a challenging resource-constrained flowshop scheduling problem that is crucial for enhancing productivity, improving yield, and minimizing wafer contamination. A novel continuous-time mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation is presented for sequencing and scheduling wafer lots in an automated wet-etch station (AWS). Several reformulations and constraints are numerically evaluated to identify the best formulation. On the basis of this formulation, a near-optimum two-step strategy that is robust with respect to lot transfer times is developed for solving moderately sized problems.","authors":["Swarnendu Bhushan","Iftekhar A Karimi"],"meta":["February 2003Industrial & Engineering Chemistry Research 42(7)","DOI:10.1021/ie020296c"],"references":["3834376_Optimization_of_cycle_time_and_utilization_in_semiconductor_test_manufacturing_using_simulation_based_on-line_near-real-time_scheduling_system","257118989_A_Tabu_Search_Approach_to_Scheduling_an_Automated_Wet_Etch_Station","245315167_A_Review_of_Production_Planning_and_Scheduling_Models_in_the_Semiconductor_Industry_Part_I_System_Characteristics_Performance_Evaluation_and_Production_Planning","245314525_Mathematical_Programming_Solution_of_a_Hoist_Scheduling_Program","242816965_Completion_Time_Algorithms_for_Serial_Multiproduct_Batch_Processes_with_Shared_Storage","231368744_Scheduling_in_serial_multiproduct_batch_processes_with_finite_interstage_storage_mixed_integer_linear_program_formulation","231366900_Scheduling_a_Single-Product_Reentrant_Process_with_Uniform_Processing_Times","35351742_Hoist_Scheduling_For_A_PCB_Electroplating_Facility","3206350_Scheduling_Semiconductor_Manufacturing_Plants"]}
