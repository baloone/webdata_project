{"id":"316910155_Towards_a_Discrete_Event_Formalization_of_Sachem's_Perception_Based_Monitoring","abstract":"This paper aims at introducing the basis of the formalization of the Sachem perception based monitoring and diagnosis approach. Sachem is an extensive large-scale real time knowledge based system designed to monitor and diagnose blast furnaces. In this paper, Sachem is considered as a monitoring cognitive agent that analyzes a continuous dynamic process in order to generate discrete events (alarms) that inform about unsatisfactory process states occurences. The paper shows how the knowledge about the behavior of a continuous process can be formalized in terms of relation between discrete events so that a recursive recognition process of signatures can be used in order to design monitoring cognitive agents. The paper concludes on the main property of the discrete event representation of continuous process, the compactness.","authors":["Marc Le Goc","Philippe Bouch√©"],"meta":["September 2004IFAC Proceedings Volumes (IFAC Papers-OnLine) 37(15):203-208","DOI:10.1016/S1474-6670(17)31024-8","Project: The Sachem Projet"],"references":["238123651_Theory_of_Modeling_and_Simulation_2nd_Edition","290347570_Abstractions_a_evenements_discrets_de_systemes_dynamiques","234817048_Qualitative_Physics_Past_Present_and_Future","223344584_Modeling_a_Dynamic_and_Uncertain_World_I_Symbolic_and_Probabilistic_Reasoning_About_Change","220309059_A_Survey_on_Temporal_Reasoning_in_Artificial_Intelligence"]}
