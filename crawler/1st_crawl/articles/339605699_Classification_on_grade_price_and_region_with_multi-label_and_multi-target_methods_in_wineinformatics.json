{"id":"339605699_Classification_on_grade_price_and_region_with_multi-label_and_multi-target_methods_in_wineinformatics","abstract":"Classifying wine according to their grade, price, and region of origin is a multi-label and multi-target problem in wine-informatics. Using wine reviews as the attributes, we compare several different multi-label/multitarget methods to the single-label method where each label is treated independently. We explore both single-label and multi-label approaches for a two-class problem for each of the labels and we explore both single-label and multi-target approaches for a four-class problem on two of the three labels, with the third label remaining a two-class problem. In terms of per-label accuracy, the single-label method has the best performance, although some multi-label methods approach the performance of single-label. However, multi-label/multi-target metrics approaches do exceed the performance of the single-label method.","authors":["James Palmer","Victor Sheng","Travis Atkison","Bernard Chen"],"meta":["March 2020Big Data Mining and Analytics 3(1):1-12","DOI:10.26599/BDMA.2019.9020014"],"references":["312153241_Multi-label_classification_with_meta_labels","311919082_The_Classification_of_White_Wine_and_Red_Wine_According_to_Their_Physicochemical_Qualities","307822454_Predicting_and_Visualizing_Wine_Characteristics_Through_Analysis_of_Tasting_Notes_from_Viewpoints","304288308_Sentiment_Analysis_of_Wine_Aroma","301632057_Meka_A_Multi-labelMulti-target_Extension_to_Weka","307881957_LIBSVM_A_library_for_support_vector_machines","304480340_The_Computational_Wine_Wheel_20_and_the_TriMax_Triclustering_in_Wineinformatics","304480193_Understanding_the_Wine_Judges_and_Evaluating_the_Consistency_Through_White-Box_Classification_Algorithms","300415128_Wineinformatics_Uncork_Napa's_Cabernet_Sauvignon_by_Association_Rule_Based_Classification","292316150_The_World's_Wine_Markets_Globalization_at_Work"]}
