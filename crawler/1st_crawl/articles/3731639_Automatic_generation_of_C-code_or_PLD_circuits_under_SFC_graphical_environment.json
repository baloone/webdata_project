{"id":"3731639_Automatic_generation_of_C-code_or_PLD_circuits_under_SFC_graphical_environment","abstract":"This paper proposes a framework for automatic development of\ncontrol systems from a high level specification based in Grafcet\nformalism. Grafcet, or sequential function charts (SFC), is a special\nclass of Petri nets and is becoming the standard representation for\nsequential control systems. The proposed framework accepts a graphical\n(through ISaGRAPH) or textual behavioural specification of the control\nsystem to be implemented. It follows the usual procedure in software\nspecification: the first step is to formally validate the initial\nspecification. Then the initial specification is translated through\nautomated processes into an implementation. At the moment there are two\npossible output languages: C and Palasm. The target processor for the C\ncode language are microcontrollers based systems that require extended\ntime constraints and access to external peripherals. The goal of\nincluding PLDs is the possibility of automatically designed mixed\nhardware and software systems","authors":["C.
