{"id":"282692327_Equivalence_classes_of_ballot_paths_modulo_strings_of_length_2_and_3","abstract":"Two paths are equivalent modulo a given string $\\tau$, whenever they have the\nsame length and the positions of the occurrences of $\\tau$ are the same in both\npaths. This equivalence relation was introduced for Dyck paths in \\cite{BP},\nwhere the number of equivalence classes was evaluated for any string of length\n2.\nIn this paper, we evaluate the number of equivalence classes in the set of\nballot paths for any string of length 2 and 3, as well as in the set of Dyck\npaths for any string of length 3.","authors":["K.
