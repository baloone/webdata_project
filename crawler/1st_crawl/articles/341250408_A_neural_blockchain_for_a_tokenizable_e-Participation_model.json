{"id":"341250408_A_neural_blockchain_for_a_tokenizable_e-Participation_model","abstract":"Currently, Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) and, especially, Blockchain technology represent a great opportunity for public institutions to improve citizen participation and foster democratic innovation. These technologies facilitate the simplification of processes and provide secure management of recorded data, guaranteeing the transmission and public transparency of information. Based on the combination of a Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) platform and G-Cloud solutions, our proposal consists of the design of an e-Participation model that uses a tokenizable system of the actions and processes undertaken by citizens in participatory processes providing incentives to promote greater participation in public affairs. In order to develop a sustainable, scalable and resilient e-Participation system, a new blockchain concept, which organizes the blocks as a neural system, is combined with the implementation of a virtual token to reward participants. Furthermore, this virtual token is deployed through a smart contract that the block itself produces, containing information about the transaction and all the documents involved in the process. Finally, our Neural Distributed Ledger (NDL) framework facilitates the interconnection of blockchain networks in a transparent, certified, secure, auditable, scalable and traceable way.","authors":["Francisco Luis Benítez Martínez","María Visitación Hurtado","Esteban Romero-Frías"],"meta":["May 2020Neurocomputing 423","DOI:10.1016/j.neucom.2020.03.116","Project: Building a neural blockchain for eDemocracy tools"],"references":["341498272_A_CONCEPTUAL_SECURE_BLOCKCHAIN-BASED_ELECTRONIC_VOTING_SYSTEM","335867307_Do_Not_Be_Fooled_Toward_a_Holistic_Comparison_of_Distributed_Ledger_Technology_Designs","335859194_On_the_Narratives_and_Background_Narratives_of_e-Government","335072844_Blockchain_Standards_and_GovernmentApplications","333508813_Linked_Democracy_Foundations_Tools_and_Applications","332091445_Benefits_and_Obstacles_of_Blockchain_Applications_in_e-Government","328183008_Examining_social_capital_and_individual_motivators_to_explain_the_adoption_of_online_citizen_participation","327812253_Blockchain-Based_E-Voting_System","327568235_Distributed_Ledger_Technology_Systems_A_Conceptual_Framework","327026935_Citizens'_intention_to_use_and_recommend_e-participation_Drawing_upon_UTAUT_and_citizen_empowerment","327026889_Platform-Independent_Secure_Blockchain-Based_Voting_System_21st_International_Conference_ISC_2018_Guildford_UK_September_9-12_2018_Proceedings","326562574_Towards_Dependable_Scalable_and_Pervasive_Distributed_Ledgers_with_Blockchains","323318041_Towards_Secure_E-Voting_Using_Ethereum_Blockchain","304298870_Blockchain_contract_A_complete_consensus_using_blockchain","291029697_Blockchain_Thinking_The_Brain_as_a_Decentralized_Autonomous_Corporation_Commentary","268283809_Understanding_Public_Engagement_Conceptualizing_and_Measuring_its_Influence_on_Supportive_Behavioral_Intentions","264815962_The_unibrennt_movement_A_successful_case_of_mobilising_lurkers_in_a_public_sphere","258126438_A_New_Theory_for_Public_Management_Toward_a_Public_Service-Dominant_Approach","235737722_Citizens'_attitudes_toward_Open_Government_and_Government_20","222839683_The_Shape_of_Eparticipation_Characterizing_an_Emerging_Research_Area","33039685_Towards_an_Evaluation_Framework_for_eParticipation","335818275_Towards_a_balanced_E-Participation_Index_Integrating_government_and_society_perspectives","335076274_Challenges_of_DLT-enabled_ScalableGovernance_and_the_Role_of_Standards","331142719_Blockchain-Enabled_Smart_Contracts_Architecture_Applications_and_Future_Trends","329872934_Blockchain_as_a_Platform","329448529_Policy_labs_in_Europe_political_innovation_structure_and_content_analysis_on_Twitter","325937904_The_governance_of_smart_cities_A_systematic_literature_review","325446521_A_Methodology_for_Digital_Government_Transformation","322000346_A_Smart_Contract_for_Boardroom_Voting_with_Maximum_Voter_Privacy","319960664_Disrupting_governance_with_blockchains_and_smart_contracts","318743126_Developing_Criteria_for_Evaluating_a_Multi-channel_Digitally_Enabled_Participatory_Budgeting_Platform","313805936_Crowdsourcing_Law_and_Policy_A_Design-Thinking_Approach_to_Crowd-Civic_Systems","313016990_Business_Innovation_Through_Blockchain","312574805_Unleashing_Innovation_beyond_Organizational_Boundaries_Exploring_Citizensourcing_Projects","299390339_How_to_Vote_Privately_Using_Bitcoin","278333639_An_analysis_of_open_government_portals_A_perspective_of_transparency_for_accountability","272402035_Open_Government_Origin_Development_and_Conceptual_Perspectives","259640004_Open_Government_Collaboration_Transparency_and_Participation_in_Practice_First","234144053_Participation_and_Democratic_Theory","233367203_The_Public's_E-Participation_Capacity_and_Motivation_in_Korea_A_Web_Survey_Analysis_from_a_New_Institutionalist_Perspective","233350534_A_Ladder_Of_Citizen_Participation","231382093_Models_of_Democracy_and_Concepts_of_Communication","228640975_Bitcoin_A_Peer-to-Peer_Electronic_Cash_System","226528602_E-Democracy_and_E-Participation_Research_in_Europe","42797885_Democratic_Innovation_Deliberation_Association_and_Representation","4779518_Innovation_in_Governance_and_Public_Services_Past_and_Present"]}
