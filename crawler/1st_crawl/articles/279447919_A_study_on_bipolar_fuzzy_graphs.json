{"id":"279447919_A_study_on_bipolar_fuzzy_graphs","abstract":"Recently, bipolar fuzzy graph is a growing research topic as it is the generalization of fuzzy graphs. In this paper, at first\nwe define three new operations on bipolar fuzzy graphs, viz. direct product, semi strong product and strong product. Likewise,\nsufficient conditions for each one of them to be complete are given. Also, it is proved that any of the products of strong bipolar\nfuzzy graphs are strong bipolar fuzzy graphs.","authors":["Sovan Samanta","Madhumangal Pal","Hossein Rashmanlou"],"meta":["January 2015Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems 28:571â€“580","Project: Fuzzy Social Networks"],"references":["314375949_Complete_fuzzy_graphs","301851029_Irregular_Bipolar_Fuzzy_Graphs","280087257_Isomorphism_on_Interval_-_valued_fuzzy_graphs","280067009_Complete_interval-valued_fuzzy_graphs","280066549_Some_Properties_of_Highly_Irregular_Interval_Valued_Fuzzy_Graphs","280066105_Balanced_Interval-Valued_Fuzzy_Graphs","286315881_Antipodal_bipolar_fuzzy_graphs","283157319_Bipolar_fuzzy_graphs","283157318_Metric_in_Bipolar_Fuzzy_Graphs","280066450_Some_Properties_of_Highly_Irregular_Interval_Valued_Fuzzy_Graphs"]}
