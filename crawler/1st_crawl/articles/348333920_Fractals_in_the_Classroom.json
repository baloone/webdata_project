{"id":"348333920_Fractals_in_the_Classroom","abstract":"What exactly is a fractal? Traditionally, students learn about the familiar forms of symmetry: reflection, translation, and rotation. Intuitively, fractals are symmetric with respect to magnification. A magnification of a small part of the fractal looks essentially the same as the entire picture. More formally, fractals have the property of self-similarityâ€”that is, a fractal is any shape that is made up of smaller copies of itself. Self-similarity is what distinguishes fractals from most conventional Euclidean figures and makes them appealing. Do fractals hold the same characteristics as other Euclidean objects? Fractals offer much to explore for even very young students.","authors":["Michael Fraboni","Trisha Moller"],"meta":["October 2008Mathematics Teacher 102(3):197-199","DOI:10.5951/MT.102.3.0197"],"references":[]}
