{"id":"348352448_Imaging_of_vascular_cognitive_impairment","abstract":"Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) is a major health challenge and represents the second most common cause of dementia. We review the updated imaging classification and imaging findings of different subtypes of VCI. We will focus on the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers of each subtype and highlight the role of advanced MR imaging sequences in the evaluation of these patients. Small vessel dementia appears as white matter hyperintensity, lacunae, microinfarcts, and microbleeds. Large vessel dementia includes strategic infarction and multi-infarction dementias. Hypoperfusion dementia can be seen as watershed infarcts and cortical laminar necrosis. Hemorrhagic dementia results from cerebral amyloid angiopathy and cortical superficial siderosis. Hereditary forms of VCI, caused by gene mutations such as CADASIL, should be suspected when dementia presents in young patients. Mixed dementia is seen in patients with Alzheimer's disease and the coexistence of cerebrovascular disease.","authors":["Ahmed Abdel Khalek Abdel Razek","Nermeen A.
