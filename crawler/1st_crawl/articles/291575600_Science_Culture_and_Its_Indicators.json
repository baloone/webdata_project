{"id":"291575600_Science_Culture_and_Its_Indicators","abstract":"The notion of ‘science culture’ is a conceptual as well as an empirical\nchallenge for social researchers. This chapter suggests a language convention to\ndistinguish ‘scientific culture’ from ‘science culture’ and reviews several efforts to\nconceptualize and measure ‘science culture’ and the difficulties of mobilizing adequate\ndata streams for that purpose. It is time to bring these different attempts into\na coherent discussion and move towards a more globally coordinated effort. To\nthat end, the chapter outlines some of the common problems of conceptualizing\nand measuring science culture and suggests a way forward.","authors":["Martin W Bauer"],"meta":["March 2012","DOI:10.1007/978-94-007-4279-6_20","ISBN: 978-94-007-4278-9"],"references":["329522539_India_Science_Report_Science_Education_Human_Resources_and_Public_Attitude_towards_Science_and_Technology","278721548_Public_Attention_to_Science_1820-2010_-_A_'Longue_Duree'_Picture","261947867_The_Mobilization_of_Scientists_for_Public_Engagement","258181247_Which_Indicators_for_the_New_Public_Engagement_Activities_An_Exploratory_Study_of_European_Research_Institutions","254111064_Studying_Values_Personal_Adventure_Future_Directions","241756113_Construction_and_Validation_of_AaEoeScience_Culture_IndexAaa","241756109_India_Science_Report_Science_Education_Human_Resources_and_Public_Attitude_towards_Science_and_Technology","236142172_The_culture_of_science_how_the_public_relates_to_science_across_the_globe","234109447_Prototypes_Of_The_Forms_Of_Scientific_Cognition_A_Survey_Of_Cultural_Attitude_To_Natural_Phenomena","233945455_Relative_Cultural_Distance_and_Public_Understanding_of_Science","228770567_Science_Knowledge_and_attitudes_across_cultures_A_meta-analysis","200088501_Public_Science_and_Cultural_Distance","31015666_Distinguishing_RED_and_GREEN_biotechnology_-_cultivation_effects_of_the_elite_press","30529419_Science_in_the_media_as_cultural_indicator_contextualizing_surveys_with_media_analysis","30524624_What_Can_We_Learn_from_25_Years_of_PUS_Survey_Research_Liberating_and_Expanding_the_Agenda","336095160_Rethinking_the_Context_and_Social_Foundation_of_Science_Education","333020299_Culture_Shift_in_Advanced_Industrial_Society","330690593_Genesis_and_Development_of_a_Scientific_Fact","288244938_Scientific_literacy_A_conceptual_and_empirical_review","287535512_Measurement_and_Statistics_on_Science_and_Technology_1920_to_the_Present","274478292_Cultural_Indicators_An_International_Symposium","261948365_The_Genesis_and_Development_of_a_Scientific_Fact","258181246_Academic_staff_and_public_communication_A_survey_of_popular_science_publishing_across_13_countries","256821853_Complementary_Use_of_Correspondence_Analysis_and_Cluster_Analysis","245517801_Relative_Constancy_of_Advertising_SpendingA_Cross-National_Examination_of_Advertising_Expenditures_and_Their_Determinants","243655942_The_Culture_Shift_in_Advanced_Industrial_Society","239060656_Concepts_of_Culture_and_Organizational_Analysis","238832554_The_influence_of_cultural_factors_on_scientific_production","232587152_Systematic_psychology_Prolegomena","232434896_Fallible_indicators_of_the_subjective_state_of_the_nation","231746856_A_Re-Assassment_of_the_Concept_of_Political_Support","228750385_Innovation_and_Its_Enemies_The_Economic_and_Political_Roots_of_Technological_Inertia","227673170_Democratization_as_an_Emancipative_Process_The_Neglected_Role_of_Mass_Motivations","227226079_Toward_Cultural_Indicators_The_analysis_of_mass_mediated_public_message_systems","226910289_Cultural_Indicators_based_on_Content_Analysis_A_Secondary_Analysis_of_sorokin's_Data_on_Fluctuations_of_Systems_of_Truth","225331249_Identifying_national_cultures_of_mathematics_education_Analysis_of_cognitive_demands_and_differential_item_functioning_in_TIMSS","224834270_The_spiral_of_scientific_culture_and_cultural_well-being_Brazil_and_Ibero-America","32048573_What_is_Scientific_and_Technological_Culture_and_How_is_it_Measured_A_Multidimensional_Model","6716692_Islam_and_Science_The_data_gap"]}
