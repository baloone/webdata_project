{"id":"232938602_LibGuides_Customizing_Subject_Guides_for_Individual_Courses","abstract":"Reference librarians at East Tennessee State University's Sherrod Library identified LibGuides as an efficient way to introduce undergraduate students, particularly those in their first two years of college, to the university library. Selecting pertinent library resources based on a course syllabus and creating a LibGuide for the course provides the students with a limited number of relevant materials. Librarians and professors view the use of subject guides attached to a course management system site as an effective educational solution. Librarians facing exponentially expanding resources and first-year students who are used to turning to Google for all their information needs can utilize LibGuides to guide students toward more relevant library resources.","authors":["Leslie Goodale Adebonojo"],"meta":["October 2010College & Undergraduate Libraries 17(4):398-412","DOI:10.1080/10691316.2010.525426"],"references":["235251755_Was_this_guide_helpful_Users'_perceptions_of_subject_guides","254173557_Internet_Subject_Guides_in_Academic_Libraries_An_Analysis_of_Contents_Practices_and_Opinions","48459012_Academic_Subject_Guides_A_Case_Study_of_Use_at_San_Jose_State_University","48306489_Students_Librarians_and_Subject_Guides_Improving_a_Poor_Rate_of_Return"]}
