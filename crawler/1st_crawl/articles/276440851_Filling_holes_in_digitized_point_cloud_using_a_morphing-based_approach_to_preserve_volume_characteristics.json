{"id":"276440851_Filling_holes_in_digitized_point_cloud_using_a_morphing-based_approach_to_preserve_volume_characteristics","abstract":"Filling holes is a major challenge to reduce digitizing time and makes the digitized model compatible with applications such as finite element (FE) analysis or inertia calculations. Indeed, whatever the sensor used, for accessibility reasons or reflection problems, some parts of the object may be non-measured defining digitizing holes in the digitized point cloud. In this paper, a method based on a mesh deformation is proposed to fill the digitized holes. The proposed method relies on the a priori knowledge of the numerical model as a nominal mesh. After identifying the digitized holes and calculating the differences between the nominal mesh and the point cloud, a deformation of the nominal mesh is performed. This deformation is determined by minimizing the energy of deformation of the mesh considered as a lattice. The proposed method is validated on a complex shape. Finally, this method is applied to an industrial part in order to highlight interest for balancing issues.","authors":["Yann Quinsat","Claire Lartigue"],"meta":["May 2015The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology 81(1)","DOI:10.1007/s00170-015-7185-0"],"references":["272591240_Voxel-based_Path_Planning_for_3D_Scanning_of_Mechanical_Parts","270981225_A_Novel_Approach_for_3D_Part_Inspection_Using_Laser-plane_Sensors","267494183_Towards_a_New_Concept_of_In-Line_Crankshaft_Balancing_by_Contact_Less_Measurement_Process_for_Selecting_the_Best_Digitizing_System","245386092_Virtual_engineering_Methods_and_tools","242934820_Scan_Planning_Strategy_for_a_General_Digitized_Surface","260792441_Filling_holes_on_locally_smooth_surfaces_reconstructed_from_point_clouds","258808263_3D_shape_modeling_using_a_self-developed_hand-held_3D_laser_scanner_and_an_efficient_HT-ICP_point_cloud_registration_algorithm","256688187_Hole_filling_of_triangular_mesh_segments_using_systematic_grey_prediction","254004636_Hong-Tan_based_ICP_registration_for_partially_overlapping_range_images","241174167_A_novel_energy-based_method_for_mesh_deformation"]}
