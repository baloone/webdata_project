{"id":"345425191_Oscillation_Reduction_and_Frequency_Analysis_of_Under-Constrained_Cable-Driven_Parallel_Robot_with_Three_Cables","abstract":"Cable-driven parallel robots (CDPRs) possess a lot of advantages over conventional parallel manipulators and link-based robot manipulators in terms of acceleration due to their low inertia. This paper deals with under-constrained CDPRs, which manipulate the end-effector to carrying the payload by using a number of cables less than six, often used preferably owing to their simple structures. Since a smaller number of cables than six are used, the end-effector of CDPR has uncontrollable degrees of freedom and that causes swaying motion and oscillations. In this paper, a scheme to curb on the unwanted oscillation of the end-effector of the CDPR with three cables is proposed based on multimode input shaping. The precise dynamic model of the under-constrained CDPR is obtained to find natural frequencies, which depends on the position of the end-effector. The advantage of the proposed method is that it is practicable to generate the trajectories for vibration suppression based on multi-mode input-shaping scheme in spite of the complexity in the dynamics and the difficulty in computing the natural frequencies of the CDPR, which are required in any input-shaping scheme. To prove the effectiveness of the proposed method, computer simulations and experiments were carried out by using 3-D motion for CDPR with three cables.","authors":["Sung Wook Hwang","Jeong-Hyeon Bak","Jonghyun Yoon","Jong Hyeon Park"],"meta":["March 2020Robotica 38(3):375-395","DOI:10.1017/S0263574719000687"],"references":["265820675_21st_Century_Kinematics-Synthesis_Compliance_and_Tensegrity","263912086_Solving_the_Direct_Geometrico-Static_Problem_of_3-3_Cable-Driven_Parallel_Robots_by_Interval_Analysis_Preliminary_Results","227054044_Geometrico-Static_Analysis_of_Under-Constrained_Cable-Driven_Parallel_Robots","221074048_A_portable_modular_parallel_wire_crane_for_rescue_operations","220758268_Large-scale_assembly_of_solar_power_plants_with_parallel_cable_robots","200556742_Workspace_Analysis_of_a_Three_DOF_Cable-Driven_Mechanism","325115652_Oscillation_damping_of_nonlinear_control_systems_based_on_the_phase_trajectory_length_concept_An_experimental_case_study_on_a_cable-driven_parallel_robot","323252274_A_neural_network-based_input_shaping_for_swing_suppression_of_an_overhead_crane_under_payload_hoisting_and_mass_variations","318274303_Rest-to-Rest_Trajectory_Planning_for_Planar_Underactuated_Cable-Driven_Parallel_Robots","311659476_Trajectory_generation_to_suppress_oscillations_in_under-constrained_cable-driven_parallel_robots","289530207_Dynamic_trajectory_planning_of_a_3-DOF_under-constrained_cable-driven_parallel_robot","281909732_Solving_the_direct_geometrico-static_problem_of_underconstrained_cable-driven_parallel_robots_by_interval_analysis","281673750_Direct_Geometrico-static_Problem_of_Underconstrained_Cable-Driven_Parallel_Robots_With_n_Cables","278696005_Global_Planning_of_Dynamically_Feasible_Trajectories_for_Three-DOF_Spatial_Cable-Suspended_Parallel_Robots","271661067_Anti-sway_trajectory_generation_of_incompletely_restrained_wire-suspended_system","267791383_Direct_Geometrico-Static_Analysis_of_Under-Constrained_Cable-Driven_Parallel_Robots_with_4_Cables","262881740_Dynamic_Point-to-Point_Trajectory_Planning_of_a_Two-DOF_Cable-Suspended_Parallel_Robot","260634708_Merlet_JP_Stability_analysis_of_underconstrained_cable-driven_parallel_robots_IEEE_Trans_Robotics_291_288-296","257621732_Real_solutions_of_the_direct_geometrico-static_problem_of_under-constrained_cable-driven_parallel_robots_with_3_cables_A_numerical_investigation","239763424_Dynamic_trajectory_planning_of_a_two-DOF_cable-suspended_parallel_robot","234783152_High-speed_manipulation_by_using_parallel_wire-driven_robots","229881504_On_the_inverse_kinematics_statics_and_fault_tolerance_of_cable-suspended_robots","229119689_A_method_for_measuring_the_inertia_properties_of_rigid_bodies","227631438_The_NIST_robocrane","225787544_Dynamics_and_flatness-based_control_of_a_kinematically_undetermined_cable_suspension_manipulator","220158264_Multi-input_shaping_design_for_vibration_reduction","200556753_Design_analysis_and_realization_of_tendon-based_parallel_manipulators","5652292_Design_Implementation_and_Clinical_Tests_of_a_Wire-Based_Robot_for_Neurorehabilitation","4310374_STRING-MAN_Wire-robot_technology_for_safe_flexible_and_human-friendly_gait_rehabilitation","3961068_Input_shapingtime_delay_control_of_maneuvering_flexible_structures","3902764_Inverse_dynamics_analysis_and_trajectory_generation_of_incompletely_restrained_wire-suspended_mechanisms","3828360_Inverse_dynamics_and_control_of_crane-type_manipulator","3770854_Zero-placement_technique_for_designing_shaped_inputs_to_suppress_multiple-mode_vibration","3450106_Trajectory_Control_of_Incompletely_Restrained_Parallel-Wire-Suspended_Mechanism_Based_on_Inverse_Dynamics","3414845_A_motion_base_with_6-DOF_by_parallel_cable_drive_architecture"]}
