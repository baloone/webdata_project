An image processing algorithm to automate the diagnosis of malaria in blood images is proposed in this paper. The image classification system is designed to positively identify malaria parasites present in thin blood smears, and differentiate the species of malaria. Images are acquired using a charge-coupled device camera connected to a light microscope. Morphological and novel threshold selection techniques are used to identify erythrocytes (red blood cells) and possible parasites present on microscopic slides. Image features based on colour, texture and the geometry of the cells and parasites are generated, as well as features that make use of a priori knowledge of the classification problem and mimic features used by human technicians. A two-stage tree classifier using back propogation feed forward neural networks distinguishes between true and false positives, and then diagnoses the species (Plasmodium Falciparum, P. Vivax, P. Ovale or P. Malariae) of the infection. Malaria samples obtained from the various biomedical research facilities are used for training and testing of the system. Infected erythrocytes are positively identified with two measurable parameters namely sensitivity and a positive predictive value (PPV), which makes the method highly sensitive at diagnosing a complete sample, provided many views are analyzed.","authors":["Mohammad Imroze Khan","Bibhudendra Acharya","Bikesh Kumar","Jigyasa Soni"],"meta":["May 2011CiiT International Journal of Biometrics and Bioinformatics 5(2):2011-97"],"references":["238107384_Diagnosis_of_malaria_infection","221260079_Malaria_Parasite_Detection_in_Peripheral_Blood_Images","221144842_Estimating_Malaria_Parasitaemia_from_Blood_Smear_Images","302937305_A_Threshold_Selection_Method_from_Gray-Level_Histogram","283921280_Visual_Pattern_Recognition_by_Moment_Invariants","260358941_Automated_classification_of_nucleated_blood_cells_using_a_binary_tree_classifier","244959198_A_New_Approach_to_Low_Level_Image_Processing_Tech","243776743_Picture_Thresholding_Using_an_Iterative_Selection_Method","232203667_A_Threshold_Selection_Method_From_Gray-Level_Histograms","222143546_A_new_method_for_gray-level_picture_thresholding_using_the_entropy_of_the_histogram"]}
