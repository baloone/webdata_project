{"id":"230609116_On_the_chromatic_number_of_a_random_hypergraph","abstract":"We consider the problem of k-colouring a random r-uniform hypergraph with n\nvertices and cn edges, where k, r, c remain constant as n tends to infinity.\nAchlioptas and Naor showed that the chromatic number of a random graph in this\nsetting, the case r=2, must have one of two easily computable values as n tends\nto infinity. We give a complete generalisation of this result to random uniform\nhypergraphs.","authors":["Martin Dyer","Alan Frieze","Catherine Greenhill"],"meta":["August 2012Journal of Combinatorial Theory Series B 113(3)","DOI:10.1016/j.jctb.2015.01.002","SourcearXiv"],"references":["236202777_Chasing_the_K-Colorability_Threshold","51943332_On_r-colorability_of_random_hypergraphs","51939042_The_condensation_transition_in_random_hypergraph_2-coloring","324422467_Constrained_Critical_Points","266222602_Constrained_Critical_Points","262158441_Sharp_thresholds_for_constraint_satisfaction_problems_and_homomorphisms","236589486_Upper-Bounding_the_k-Colorability_Threshold_by_Counting_Covers","227701219_Two-Coloring_Random_Hypergraphs","222440487_The_First_Cycles_in_an_Evolving_Graph","45860704_On_the_Number_of_Perfect_Matchings_in_Random_Lifts","2889525_Hunting_for_Sharp_Thresholds","2869225_The_Two_Possible_Values_of_the_Chromatic_Number_of_a_Random_Graph","2851575_The_Chromatic_Numbers_of_Random_Hypergraphs","2400065_A_Sharp_Threshold_for_k-Colorability","1939144_Random_k-SAT_Two_Moments_Suffice_to_Cross_a_Sharp_Threshold"]}
