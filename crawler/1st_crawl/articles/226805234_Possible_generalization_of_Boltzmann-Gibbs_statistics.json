{"id":"226805234_Possible_generalization_of_Boltzmann-Gibbs_statistics","abstract":"With the use of a quantity normally scaled in multifractals, a generalized form is postulated for entropy, namelyS\n\nq\nk [1 â€“ \ni=1\nW\np\ni\nq\n]/(q-1), whereq characterizes the generalization andp\ni are the probabilities associated withW (microscopic) configurations (W). The main properties associated with this entropy are established, particularly those corresponding to the microcanonical and canonical ensembles. The Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics is recovered as theq1 limit.","authors":["Constantino Tsallis"],"meta":["July 1988Journal of Statistical Physics 52(1):479-487","DOI:10.1007/BF01016429"],"references":["235508745_Fractal_measures_and_their_singularities_The_characterization_of_strange_sets","223852626_The_Infinite_Number_of_Generalised_Dimensions_of_Fractals_and_Strange_Attractors","222438936_Vulpiani_A_Anomalous_scaling_laws_in_multifractal_objects_Phys_Rep_156_147"]}
