{"id":"324650663_Plasmodium_falciparum_resistance_to_artemisinin-based_combination_therapies_A_sword_of_Damocles_in_the_path_toward_malaria_elimination","abstract":"The use of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs), which combine an artemisinin derivative with a partner drug, in the treatment of uncomplicated malaria has largely been responsible for the significant reduction in malaria-related mortality in tropical and subtropical regions. ACTs have also played a significant role in the 18% decline in the incidence of malaria cases from 2010 to 2016. However, this progress is seriously threatened by the reduced clinical efficacy of artemisinins, which is characterised by delayed parasitic clearance and a high rate of recrudescence, as reported in 2008 in Western Cambodia. Resistance to artemisinins has already spread to several countries in Southeast Asia. Furthermore, resistance to partner drugs has been shown in some instances to be facilitated by pre-existing decreased susceptibility to the artemisinin component of the ACT. A major concern is not only the spread of these multidrug-resistant parasites to the rest of Asia but also their possible appearance in Sub-Saharan Africa, the continent most affected by malaria, as has been the case in the past with parasite resistance to other antimalarial treatments. It is therefore essential to understand the acquisition of resistance to artemisinins by Plasmodium falciparum to adapt malaria treatment policies and to propose new therapeutic solutions.","authors":["Manel Ouji","Jean-Michel Augereau","Lucie Paloque","Fran√ßoise Benoit-Vical"],"meta":["April 2018Parasite 25:24","DOI:10.1051/parasite/2018021"],"references":["322516653_Poor_response_to_artesunate_treatment_in_two_patients_with_severe_malaria_on_the_Thai-Myanmar_border","320427532_Declining_Transmission_and_Immunity_to_Malaria_and_Emerging_Artemisinin_Resistance_in_Thailand_A_Longitudinal_Study","318091287_Triple_Combination_Therapy_and_Drug_Cycling-Tangential_Strategies_for_Countering_Artemisinin_Resistance","317378511_Combating_multi-drug_resistant_Plasmodium_falciparum_malaria","317209028_Do_anti-malarials_in_Africa_meet_quality_standards_The_market_penetration_of_non_quality-assured_artemisinin_combination_therapy_in_eight_African_countries","316570806_Longitudinal_genomic_surveillance_of_Plasmodium_falciparum_malaria_parasites_reveals_complex_genomic_architecture_of_emerging_artemisinin_resistance","316053265_Plasmodium_falciparum_K13_Mutations_Differentially_Impact_Ozonide_Susceptibility_and_Parasite_Fitness_In_Vitro","322690440_Remodeling_of_the_malaria_parasite_and_host_human_red_cell_by_vesicle_amplification_that_induces_artemisinin_resistance","321336172_Endoperoxide-based_compounds_cross-resistance_with_artemisinins_and_selection_of_a_Plasmodium_falciparum_lineage_with_a_K13_non-synonymous_polymorphism","320155153_Counterfeit_and_substandard_malaria_drugs_in_Africa"]}
