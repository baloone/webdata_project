Here, we analyzed over 490,000,000 data points to compare 10 different ML-workflows in a large (N=11,652) training dataset of human pancreatic single-cell (sc-)transcriptomes to identify genes associated with the presence or absence of insulin transcript(s). Prediction accuracy/sensitivity of each ML-workflow were tested in a separate validation dataset (N=2,913). Ensemble ML-workflows, in particular Random Forest ML-algorithm delivered high predictive power (AUC=0.83) and sensitivity (0.98), compared to other algorithms. The transcripts identified through these analyses also demonstrated significant correlation with insulin in bulk RNA-seq data from human islets. The top-10 features, (including IAPP, ADCYAP1, LDHA and SST) common to the three Ensemble ML-workflows were significantly dysregulated in scRNA-seq datasets from Ire-1αβ-/- mice that demonstrate dedifferentiation of pancreatic β-cells in a model of type 1 diabetes (T1D) and in pancreatic single cells from individuals with type 2 Diabetes (T2D). Our findings provide direct comparison of ML-workflows in big data analyses, identify key determinants of insulin transcription and provide workflows for future analyses.","authors":["Wilson KM Wong","Vinod Thorat","Mugdha V Joglekar","Charlotte X Dong"],"meta":["March 2021","DOI:10.1101/2021.03.27.437353"],"references":["350326250_Postpartum_circulating_microRNA_enhances_prediction_of_future_type_2_diabetes_in_women_with_previous_gestational_diabetes","343312957_Single_cell_transcriptomics_of_human_islet_ontogeny_defines_the_molecular_basis_of_b_cell_dedifferentiation_in_T2D","342562166_Logistic_regression_has_similar_performance_to_optimised_machine_learning_algorithms_in_a_clinical_setting_application_to_the_discrimination_between_type_1_and_type_2_diabetes_in_young_adults","341533700_Amino_acid_and_lipid_metabolism_in_post-gestational_diabetes_and_progression_to_type_2_diabetes_A_metabolic_profiling_study","332452162_Machine_learning_and_complex_biological_data","330401998_The_discovery_of_novel_predictive_biomarkers_and_early-stage_pathophysiology_for_the_transition_from_gestational_diabetes_to_type_2_diabetes","329873035_Prediction_Modeling_Methodology","329192400_A_primer_on_deep_learning_in_genomics","340211806_Beta_Cell_Dedifferentiation_Induced_by_IRE1a_Deletion_Prevents_Type_1_Diabetes","331335435_Protocol_Update_for_large-scale_genome_and_gene_function_analysis_with_the_PANTHER_classification_system_v140"]}
