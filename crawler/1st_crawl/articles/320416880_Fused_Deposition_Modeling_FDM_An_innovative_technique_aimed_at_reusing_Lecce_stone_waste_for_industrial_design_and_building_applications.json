For\nthousands of years people have extracted it from the Salento quarries for use as an ornamental, celebrative\nor building material. The production chain of this stone, from extraction through to the finished\nproduct, results in a great deal of scraps produced in both solid and muddy form. In recent decades a\nnew attitude toward stone scraps has gradually taken hold, namely an eco-design approach. Already\nadopted by some companies, it consists of reusing industrial scraps to produce innovative manufacturing\nproducts. Nowadays, in fact, only a small percentage of Lecce Stone (LS) scraps is recycled and used as\nraw material in other fields, while a significant portion is taken to the landfill, as in the case of the scraps\nproduced in laboratories by Apulian artisans.\nThe aim of this paper is to design a novel composite biomaterial, based on Polylactic acid (PLA) and\nLecce Stone (LS) scraps and verify its suitability for use by designers to produce original industrial and\nbuilding products, thereby obtaining environmental advantages through this new practice, based on\nthe Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) technique.","authors":["C.
