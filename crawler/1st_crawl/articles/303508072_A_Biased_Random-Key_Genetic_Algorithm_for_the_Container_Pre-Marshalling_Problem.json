{"id":"303508072_A_Biased_Random-Key_Genetic_Algorithm_for_the_Container_Pre-Marshalling_Problem","abstract":"The container pre-marshalling problem (CPMP) is performed at container terminals around the world to re-order containers so that they can be more efficiently transferred through the terminal. We introduce a novel decoder for a biased random-key genetic algorithm (BRKGA) that solves the CPMP. The decoder consists of a construction algorithm that learns how to best apply single and compound containers moves to quickly sort a bay of containers. Our approach finds better solutions than the state-of-the-art method on many instances of the standard pre-marshalling benchmarks in less computational time. Furthermore, we perform a computational analysis of different components of the BRKGA decoder to determine what types of heuristics work best for pre-marshalling problems, as well as conduct a feature space analysis of different pre-marshalling approaches.","authors":["Andr√© Hottung","Kevin Tierney"],"meta":["May 2016Computers & Operations Research 75","DOI:10.1016/j.cor.2016.05.011"],"references":["318837359_The_Geography_of_Transport_Systems","304489964_Solving_the_Pre-Marshalling_Problem_to_Optimality_with_A_and_IDA","280512408_Metaheuristics_for_the_Two-Dimensional_Container_Pre-Marshalling_Problem","279038704_An_Algorithm_Selection_Benchmark_of_the_Container_Pre-Marshalling_Problem","277958776_ASlib_A_Benchmark_Library_for_Algorithm_Selection","261178595_A_Domain-Specific_Knowledge-Based_Heuristic_for_the_Blocks_Relocation_Problem","258118451_A_Proposed_Heuristic_for_Solving_the_Container_Pre-Marshalling_Problem","258118271_A_Proposed_Heuristic_for_Solving_the_Container_Pre-Marshalling_Problem","225493172_Container_terminal_operation_and_operations_research_-_A_classification_and_literature_review","225323734_Operations_research_at_container_terminals_A_literature_update","221632672_A_Gender-Based_Genetic_Algorithm_for_the_Automatic_Configuration_of_Algorithms","221477684_Fast_Generation_of_Near-Optimal_Plans_for_Eco-Efficient_Stowage_of_Large_Container_Vessels","201976036_On_the_Virtues_of_Parametrized_Uniform_Crossover","51969319_Scikit-learn_Machine_Learning_in_Python","278962826_Optimizing_Liner_Shipping_Fleet_Repositioning_Plans","274959395_Solving_the_container_pre-marshalling_problem_using_variable_length_genetic_algorithms","270595161_A_biased_random-key_genetic_algorithm_for_the_capacitated_minimum_spanning_tree_problem","270006700_Target-guided_algorithms_for_the_container_pre-marshalling_problem","267811595_A_Multi-Heuristic_Approach_for_Solving_the_Pre-Marshalling_Problem","266748714_Solving_the_container_relocation_problem_by_an_improved_greedy_look-ahead_heuristic","264476699_Models_and_algorithms_for_shuffling_problems_in_steel_plants","264161295_Loading_unloading_and_premarshalling_of_stacks_in_storage_areas_Survey_and_classification","264052639_Simulation-based_optimization_for_housekeeping_in_a_container_transshipment_terminal","263507000_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","261792198_Biased_Random_Keys_Genetic_Algorithm_for_the_Tactical_Berth_Allocation_Problem","260608987_On_the_complexity_of_container_stowage_planning_problems","259513945_Towards_objective_measures_of_algorithm_performance_across_instance_space","259187387_A_mathematical_model_of_inter-terminal_transportation","256807375_Letter_to_the_Editor","237321515_AGV_Dispatching_Strategies_at_Automated_Seaport_Container_Terminals","236329699_Iterative_Deepening_A_Algorithms_for_the_Container_Relocation_Problem","236236641_Pre-Marshalling_Problem_Heuristic_solution_method_and_instances_generator","234143852_An_Investigation_of_IDA_Algorithms_for_the_Container_Relocation_Problem","226742576_Strategies_for_dispatching_AGVs_at_automated_seaport_container_terminals","225143891_A_Corridor_Method-Based_Algorithm_for_the_Pre-marshalling_Problem","222479687_On_the_Complexity_of_Blocks-World_Planning","220770424_The_Complexity_of_Sorting_with_Networks_of_Stacks_and_Queues","220689401_An_Introduction_to_Genetic_Algorithms_MIT_Press_Cambridge","220669338_Bean_J_Genetic_algorithms_and_random_keys_for_sequencing_and_optimization_ORSA_Journal_of_Computing_62_154-160","220472965_A_heuristic_rule_for_relocating_blocks","220471603_A_parallel_multi-population_biased_random-key_genetic_algorithm_for_a_container_loading_problem","220469782_Hsu_NY_An_optimization_model_for_the_container_pre-marshalling_problem_Computers_Operations_Research_34_3295-3313","220403425_Biased_random-key_genetic_algorithms_for_combinatorial_optimization","220384645_Heuristic_algorithms_for_container_pre-marshalling_problems","220288872_A_tree_search_procedure_for_the_container_pre-marshalling_problem","220209570_The_Pilot_method_A_strategy_for_heuristic_repetition_with_application_to_the_Steiner_problem_in_graphs","23984382_A_neighborhood_search_heuristic_for_pre-marshalling_export_containers","23516367_Co-Operation_and_Competition_in_International_Container_Transport_Strategies_for_Ports","5223644_Schedule_Unreliability_in_Liner_Shipping_Origins_and_Consequences_for_the_Hinterland_Supply_Chain","5223613_The_Time_Factor_in_Liner_Shipping_Services"]}
