{"id":"311852252_Constructing_completely_independent_spanning_trees_in_crossed_cubes","abstract":"The Completely Independent Spanning Trees (CISTs) are a very useful construct in a computer network. It can find applications in many important network functions, especially in reliable broadcasting, i.e., guaranteeing broadcasting operation in the presence of faulty nodes. The question for the existence of two CISTs in an arbitrary network is an NP-hard problem. Therefore most research on CISTs to date has been concerning networks of specific structures. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to construct two CISTs in the crossed cube, a prominent, widely studied variant of the well-known hypercube. The construction algorithm will be presented, and its correctness proved. Based on that, the existence of two CISTs in a special Bijective Connection network based on crossed cube is also discussed.","authors":["Baolei Cheng","Dajin Wang","Jianxi Fan"],"meta":["December 2016Discrete Applied Mathematics 219(3)","DOI:10.1016/j.dam.2016.11.019"],"references":["273664521_Completely_Independent_Spanning_Trees_on_Some_Interconnection_Networks","220587447_Optimal_Independent_Spanning_Trees_on_Hypercubes","3299614_The_crossed_cube_architecture_for_parallel_computing","308029131_Minimum_Degree_Conditions_and_Optimal_Graphs_for_Completely_Independent_Spanning_Trees","305002388_Paired_many-to-many_disjoint_path_covers_in_restricted_hypercube-like_graphs","292462938_Paired_many-to-many_disjoint_path_covers_in_restricted_hypercube-like_graphs","283407357_Completely_Independent_Spanning_Trees_on_Complete_Graphs_Complete_Bipartite_Graphs_and_Complete_Tripartite_Graphs","282517320_A_Note_on_the_Degree_Condition_of_Completely_Independent_Spanning_Trees","273392480_Dimensional-Permutation-Based_Independent_Spanning_Trees_in_Bijective_Connection_Networks","265967127_Completely_Independent_Spanning_Trees_in_Some_Regular_Graphs","265015568_Ore's_condition_for_completely_independent_spanning_trees","262175004_Completely_independent_spanning_trees_in_torus_networks","259539164_Dirac's_Condition_for_Completely_Independent_Spanning_Trees","257252425_Dimension-adjacent_trees_and_parallel_construction_of_independent_spanning_trees_on_crossed_cubes","256721175_Independent_spanning_trees_in_crossed_cubes","256693980_Two_counterexamples_on_completely_independent_spanning_trees","243134154_Completely_independent_spanning_trees_in_the_underlying_graph_of_a_line_digraph","222437007_Rodeh_M_The_multi-tree_approach_to_reliability_in_distributed_networks_Inform_Comput_79_43-59","222156651_Embedding_meshes_into_crossed_cubes","222128205_A_dynamic_programming_algorithm_for_simulation_of_a_multi-dimensional_torus_in_a_crossed_cube","221511348_Multi-node_Broadcasting_in_All-Ported_3-D_Wormhole-Routed_Torus_Using_Aggregation-then-Distribution_Strategy","220855614_On_the_Multiply-Twisted_Hypercube","220752647_Completely_Independent_Spanning_Trees_in_Maximal_Planar_Graphs","220313259_Embedding_a_family_of_disjoint_3D_meshes_into_a_crossed_cube","220312853_A_fast_fault-identification_algorithm_for_bijective_connection_graphs_using_the_PMC_model","220310873_Efficient_unicast_in_bijective_connection_networks_with_the_restricted_faulty_node_set","220155182_Constructing_independent_spanning_trees_for_locally_twisted_cubes","220151713_Constructing_edge-disjoint_spanning_trees_in_locally_twisted_cubes","220115861_Multiply-Twisted_Hypercube_with_Five_or_More_Dimensions_is_not_Vertex-Transitive","220115401_Fault-tolerant_cycle-embedding_of_crossed_cubes","3726598_Reliable_Broadcasting_and_Secure_Distributing_in_Channel_Networks","3301359_On_Embedding_Hamiltonian_Cycles_in_Crossed_Cubes","3300330_Efficient_broadcasting_in_wormhole-routed_multicomputers_A_network-partitioning_approach","3043516_Embedding_binary_trees_into_crossed_cubes","3042877_A_Variation_on_the_hypercube_with_lower_diameter"]}
