{"id":"295296494_The_evolution_of_an_ESP_programme_in_Cuba","abstract":"During the last 15 years a large-scale ESP teacher-training and curriculum development programme has been under way in Cuba, affecting all English language education under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Public Health. We call it a \"programme\", because the developments have throughout been supported and encouraged by the Ministry. But it was not conceived of as a project with a name, a framework of objectives, timelines and evaluation procedures. Until now it has been undocumented, yet enormous changes have taken place in the medical undergraduate English language curriculum, in English courses for doctors and in English language teacher education.
