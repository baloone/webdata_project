{"id":"356437579_-K-G-FRAMES_AND_THEIR_DUALS_FOR_HILBERT_A_-MODULES","abstract":"Frame theory has a great revolution in recent years. This new Theory have been extended from Hilbert spaces to Hilbert C *-modules. In this paper, we introduce the notion of dual *-K-g-frames in Hilbert A-modules. Lastly we study *-K-g-frames in tensor product of Hilbert C *-Modules and we establish some new results.","authors":["M ' Hamed Ghiati","Samir Kabbaj","Hatim Labrigui","Abdeslam Touri"],"meta":["November 2021","DOI:10.28919/jmcs/6819","Project: - Sur une extension des Frames aux A-modules de Hilbert"],"references":["323402346_ast-K-g-Frames_in_Hilbert_mathcalA-modules","280962359_Generalized_Frames_with_C-Valued_Bounds_and_their_Operator_Duals","266001922_-Frames_in_Hilbert_C_-modules","265127971_-Frames_for_operators_on_Hilbert_modules","260482460_Frames_and_operators_in_Hilbert_C-modules","225180017_Frames_and_bases_in_tensor_products_of_Hilbert_spaces_and_Hilbert_C-modules","325540567_An_introduction_to_frames_and_riesz_bases","244954656_A_Course_in_Operator_Theory","242987613_Solutions_to_operator_equations_on_Hilbert_C_-modules","226376607_The_Factor_Decomposition_Theorem_of_Bounded_Generalized_Inverse_Modules_and_Their_Topological_Continuity"]}
