{"id":"301847993_Exploring_the_Limits_of_Language_Modeling","abstract":"In this work we explore recent advances in Recurrent Neural Networks for large scale Language Modeling, a task central to language understanding. We extend current models to deal with two key challenges present in this task: corpora and vocabulary sizes, and complex, long term structure of language. We perform an exhaustive study on techniques such as character Convolutional Neural Networks or Long-Short Term Memory, on the One Billion Word Benchmark. Our best single model significantly improves state-of-the-art perplexity from 51.3 down to 30.0 (whilst reducing the number of parameters by a factor of 20), while an ensemble of models sets a new record by improving perplexity from 41.0 down to 23.7. We also release these models for the NLP and ML community to study and improve upon.","authors":["Rafal Jozefowicz","Oriol Vinyals","Mike Schuster","Noam Shazeer"],"meta":["February 2016"],"references":["301839500_TensorFlow_Large-Scale_Machine_Learning_on_Heterogeneous_Distributed_Systems","284788422_BlackOut_Speeding_up_Recurrent_Neural_Network_Language_Models_With_Very_Large_Vocabularies","283761501_Larger-Context_Language_Modelling","280912217_Finding_Function_in_Form_Compositional_Character_Models_for_Open_Vocabulary_Word_Representation","280773308_Improved_Transition-Based_Parsing_by_Modeling_Characters_instead_of_Words_with_LSTMs","280221106_Hierarchical_Neural_Network_Generative_Models_for_Movie_Dialogues","272423336_Unsupervised_Learning_of_Video_Representations_using_LSTMs","271771424_Scaling_Recurrent_Neural_Network_Language_Models","262877889_Learning_Phrase_Representations_using_RNN_Encoder-Decoder_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation","262272503_Large_pruned_or_continuous_space_language_models_on_a_GPU_for_statistical_machine_translation","259239818_One_Billion_Word_Benchmark_for_Measuring_Progress_in_Statistical_Language_Modeling","233730646_On_the_difficulty_of_training_Recurrent_Neural_Networks","228348202_Hierarchical_probabilistic_neural_network_language_model","221361415_ImageNet_a_Large-Scale_Hierarchical_Image_Database","220320709_Noise-contrastive_estimation_A_new_estimation_principle_for_unnormalized_statistical_models","220017637_Building_a_Large_Annotated_Corpus_of_English_The_Penn_Treebank","13853244_Long_Short-term_Memory","12292425_Learning_to_Forget_Continual_Prediction_with_LSTM","5462889_Adaptive_Importance_Sampling_to_Accelerate_Training_of_a_Neural_Probabilistic_Language_Model","3316656_Bidirectional_recurrent_neural_networks","319770465_Sequence_to_Sequence_Learning_with_Neural_Networks","311469848_Recurrent_neural_network_based_language_model","301445791_Sentence_Compression_by_Deletion_with_LSTMs","285896121_Learning_word_embeddings_efficiently_with_noise-contrastive_estimation","285704049_Neural_Probabilistic_Language_Models","285648958_Multilingual_Language_Processing_From_Bytes","285432248_Decoding_with_large-scale_neural_language_models_improves_translation","283761538_Document_Context_Language_Models","281487270_A_Neural_Attention_Model_for_Abstractive_Sentence_Summarization","281312208_Character-Aware_Neural_Language_Models","280329704_Training_Very_Deep_Networks","279714069_Long_short-term_memory_recurrent_neural_network_architectures_for_large_scale_acoustic_modeling","279535160_Sparse_Non-negative_Matrix_Language_Modeling_For_Skip-grams","278969291_A_Neural_Conversational_Model","269933131_Efficient_Exact_Gradient_Update_for_training_Deep_Networks_with_Very_Large_Sparse_Targets","267960550_ImageNet_Classification_with_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","267627635_Addressing_the_Rare_Word_Problem_in_Neural_Machine_Translation","266458936_Statistical_Language_Models_Based_on_Neural_Networks","265554383_Sequence_to_Sequence_Learning_with_Neural_Networks","265469170_Recurrent_Neural_Network_Regularization","262289197_Deep_neural_network_language_models","261475541_A_Convolutional_Neural_Network_for_Modelling_Sentences","255563511_Context_Dependent_Recurrent_Neural_Network_Language_Model","255173850_Generating_Sequences_With_Recurrent_Neural_Networks","221618232_A_Scalable_Hierarchical_Distributed_Language_Model","221480736_Empirical_Evaluation_and_Combination_of_Advanced_Language_Modeling_Techniques","221345823_Generating_Text_with_Recurrent_Neural_Networks","7647316_Framewise_phoneme_classification_with_bidirectional_LSTM_and_other_neural_network_architectures","3618313_Improved_Backing-off_for_N-gram_Language_Modeling","2439558_Handwritten_Digit_Recognition_with_a_Back-Propagation_Network","2343555_An_Efficient_Gradient-Based_Algorithm_for_On-Line_Training_of_Recurrent_Network_Trajectories"]}
