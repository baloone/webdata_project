{"id":"327036615_Robotics_for_soft_skills_training","abstract":"Robotics is a powerful tool in education and it has gained a notable impact in the field of teaching computer science, engineering, math, physics and similar. As educational robotics laboratories stimulate many different abilities in students, such as problem solving and group working, it is possible to use robotics to promote soft skills as well.\nSoft skills are necessary to complement hard skills to build the 21st century professionalism, so it seems relevant to start promoting these skills as soon as possible. In this paper, we describe a lab for primary and first grade secondary schools in which robotics is employed to train soft skills in an informal context.","authors":["Franco Rubinacci","Michela Ponticorvo","Rosa Passariello","Orazio Miglino"],"meta":["December 2017","DOI:10.1515/rem-2017-0010"],"references":["237589422_Le_nuove_macchine_per_apprendere_Simulazioni_al_computer_robot_e_videogiochi_multi-utente_Alcuni_prototipi","225740982_Using_artificial_life_to_teach_evolutionary_biology","220677373_Breedbot_An_evolutionary_robotics_application_in_digital_content","24040297_Urban_Interactions_Soft_Skills_Versus_Specialization","5289502_LEGOR_Therapy_and_the_Social_Use_of_Language_Programme_An_Evaluation_of_Two_Social_Skills_Interventions_for_Children_with_High_Functioning_Autism_and_Asperger_Syndrome","311999371_Breeding_Robots_to_Learn_How_to_Rule_Complex_Systems","311508664_Robotics_in_Education","265066459_The_Hard_Case_for_Soft_Skills","234707215_Teaching_Evolution_to_Non-English_Proficient_Students_by_Using_Lego_Robotics","220140191_Exploring_the_educational_potential_of_robotics_in_schools_A_systematic_review"]}
