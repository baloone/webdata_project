{"id":"277930405_Recent_Advances_in_Agent-Based_Tsunami_Evacuation_Simulations_Case_Studies_in_Indonesia_Thailand_Japan_and_Peru","abstract":"As confirmed by the extreme tsunami events over the last decade (the 2004 Indian Ocean, 2010 Chile and 2011 Japan tsunami events), mitigation measures and effective evacuation planning are needed to reduce disaster risks. Modeling tsunami evacuations is an alternative means to analyze evacuation plans and possible scenarios of evacueesâ€™ behaviors. In this paper, practical applications of an agent-based tsunami evacuation model are presented to demonstrate the contributions that agent-based modeling has added to tsunami evacuation simulations and tsunami mitigation efforts. A brief review of previous agent-based evacuation models in the literature is given to highlight recent progress in agent-based methods. Finally, challenges are noted for bridging gaps between geoscience and social science within the agent-based approach for modeling tsunami evacuations.","authors":["Erick Mas","Shunichi Koshimura","Fumihiko Imamura","Anawat Suppasri"],"meta":["May 2015Pure and Applied Geophysics 172(12)","DOI:10.1007/s00024-015-1105-y"],"references":["313554168_Self-organized_pedestrian_crowd_dynamics_Experiments_simulations_and_design_solutions","291859429_Tsunami_evacuation_simulation_for_disaster_education_and_city_planning","289573563_Strong_Motion_Simulation_of_the_M80_August_15_2007_Pisco_Earthquake_Effect_of_a_Multi-Frequency_Rupture_Process","289329533_SATREPS_Project_on_Enhancement_of_Earthquake_and_Tsunami_Disaster_Mitigation_Technology_in_Peru","316960627_Development_of_Evacuation_Simulator_for_Tsunami_Disaster_Mitigation","316808493_Development_of_Practical_Scenario_Simulator_for_Dissemination_of_Disaster_Information","313396878_Validation_and_verification_of_agent-based_models_in_the_social_sciences","313373443_Multi_agent_simulation_model_for_evaluating_evacuation_management_system_against_tsunami_disaster","286021358_Teamwork_in_Multi-Agent_Systems_A_Formal_Approach","277396263_Human_Behavior_during_the_Tsunami_of_May_1960_Research_on_the_Hawaiian_disaster_explores_the_consequences_of_an_ambiguous_warning_system"]}
