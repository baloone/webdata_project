{"id":"268694967_The_incidence_game_chromatic_number_of_-decomposable_graphs","abstract":"The incidence coloring game has been introduced in Andres (2009) [2] as a variation of the ordinary coloring game. The incidence game chromatic number ιg(G)ιg(G) of a graph G is the minimum number of colors for which Alice has a winning strategy when playing the incidence coloring game on G.In Charpentier and Sopena (2013) [7], we proved that ιg(G)≤⌊3Δ(G)−a2⌋+8a−1 for every graph G with arboricity at most a . In this paper, we extend our previous result to (a,d)(a,d)-decomposable graphs – that is graphs whose set of edges can be partitioned into two parts, one inducing a graph with arboricity at most a , the other inducing a graph with maximum degree at most d – and prove that ιg(G)≤⌊3Δ(G)−a2⌋+8a+3d−1 for every (a,d)(a,d)-decomposable graph G.","authors":["Clément Charpentier","Eric Sopena"],"meta":["October 2014Journal of Discrete Algorithms 31","DOI:10.1016/j.jda.2014.10.001"],"references":["237000032_Incidence_Coloring_Game_and_Arboricity_of_Graphs","228619278_The_Map-Coloring_game","262158408_A_Simple_Competitive_Graph_Coloring_Algorithm","247040091_On_the_game_chromatic_number_of_some_classes_of_graphs","243087453_Decomposition_of_Finite_Graphs_Into_Forests","240177990_Planar_graph_coloring_with_an_uncooperative_partner","228953235_The_game_chromatic_number_of_graphs","227974191_Game_Chromatic_Number_of_Outerplanar_Graphs","227724164_Edge-partitions_of_planar_graphs_and_their_game_coloring_numbers","225781071_On_the_complexity_of_some_coloring_games"]}
