{"id":"224919456_Learning-Graph-Based_Quantum_Algorithm_for_k-Distinctness","abstract":"We present a quantum algorithm solving the $k$-distinctness problem in\n$O(n^{1-2^{k-2}/(2^k-1)})$ queries with a bounded error. This improves the\nprevious $O(n^{k/(k+1)})$-query algorithm by Ambainis. The construction uses a\nmodified learning graph approach. Compared to the recent paper by Belovs and\nLee arXiv:1108.3022, the algorithm doesn't require any prior information on the\ninput, and the complexity analysis is much simpler.\nAdditionally, we introduce an $O(\\sqrt{n}\\alpha^{1/6})$ algorithm for the\ngraph collision problem where $\\alpha$ is the independence number of the graph.","authors":["Aleksandrs Belovs"],"meta":["May 2012Foundations of Computer Science, 1975., 16th Annual Symposium on","DOI:10.1109/FOCS.2012.18","SourcearXiv"],"references":["239761510_Span_Programs_for_Functions_with_Constant-Sized_1-certificates","228083323_Adversary_Lower_Bound_for_the_k-sum_Problem","227992557_Tight_Bounds_on_Quantum_Searching","224266341_Quantum_Query_Complexity_of_State_Conversion","319523609_Tight_Bounds_on_Quantum_Searching","266701337_Quantum_algorithms_for_subset_finding","263912318_QUANTUM_QUERY_COMPLEXITY_OF_CONSTANT-SIZED_SUBGRAPH_CONTAINMENT","238358717_Tight_bounds_on_quantum_search","222780666_Quantum_Lower_Bounds_by_Quantum_Arguments","222569158_Complexity_measures_and_decision_tree_complexity_A_survey"]}
