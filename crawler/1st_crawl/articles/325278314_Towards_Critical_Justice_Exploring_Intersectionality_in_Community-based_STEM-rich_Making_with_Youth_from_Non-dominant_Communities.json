{"id":"325278314_Towards_Critical_Justice_Exploring_Intersectionality_in_Community-based_STEM-rich_Making_with_Youth_from_Non-dominant_Communities","abstract":"We investigated how community ethnography as a pedagogy approach to STEM-rich making supported youth makers from two low-income urban communities engaged in sustained STEM-rich making towards making a difference in their communities. Data is drawn from two-year long ethnographic data across two community-based, youth making programs. We highlight two cases. Case # 1 focuses on one African American girl's making endeavors across one school year. Case # 2 looks at how two youth engaged in critical sense-making with regards to the currently available how-to making resources they could locate online. We discuss how these pedagogical moves supported the youth in making towards a more just future in ways that addressed intersecting scales of injustice.","authors":["Edna Tan","Angela Calabrese Barton"],"meta":["January 2018Equity & Excellence in Education 51(1):48-61","DOI:10.1080/10665684.2018.1439786"],"references":["303982662_Making_Through_the_Lens_of_Culture_and_Power_Toward_Transformative_Visions_for_Educational_Equity","298808178_Learning_to_Make_in_the_Museum_The_Role_of_Maker_Educators","277992187_Decolonization_Is_Not_a_Metaphor","270115561_Employing_Multilevel_Intersectionality_in_Educational_Research_Latino_Identities_Contexts_and_College_Access","345054529_Decentering_Student_Uniqueness_in_Lessons_about_Intersectionality","333697778_Children_Are_Not_Hackers","323321185_Justice_and_the_Politics_of_Difference","312940207_The_Computer_Clubhouse_Constructionism_and_Creativity_in_Youth_Communities_Technology_Education--Connections","302930119_Mapping_the_margins_Intersectionality_identity_politics_and_violence_against_women_of_color","285982535_Latinos_Unidos_From_Cultural_Diversity_to_the_Politics_of_Solidarity"]}
