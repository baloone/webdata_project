{"id":"281395011_Bilevel_Parameter_Learning_for_Higher-Order_Total_Variation_Regularisation_Models","abstract":"We consider a bilevel optimisation approach for parameter learning in\nhigher-order total variation image reconstruction models. Apart from the least\nsquares cost functional, naturally used in bilevel learning, we propose and\nanalyse an alternative cost, based on a Huber regularised TV-seminorm.\nDifferentiability properties of the solution operator are verified and a\nfirst-order optimality system is derived. Based on the adjoint information, a\nquasi-Newton algorithm is proposed for the numerical solution of the bilevel\nproblems. Numerical experiments are carried out to show the suitability of our\napproach and the improved performance of the new cost functional. Thanks to the\nbilevel optimisation framework, also a detailed comparison between TGV$^2$ and\nICTV is carried out, showing the advantages and shortcomings of both\nregularisers, depending on the structure of the processed images and their\nnoise level.","authors":["Juan Carlos De los Reyes","Carola-Bibiane Sch√∂nlieb","T.
