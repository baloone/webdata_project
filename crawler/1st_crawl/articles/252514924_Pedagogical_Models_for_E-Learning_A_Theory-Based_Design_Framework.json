{"id":"252514924_Pedagogical_Models_for_E-Learning_A_Theory-Based_Design_Framework","abstract":"This paper presents a theory-based design framework for E-Learning that emphasizes the transformative interaction between pedagogical models, instructional strategies, and learning technologies. I argue that situated or distributed cognition is an appropriate foundational knowledge perspective from which to derive pedagogical models and constructs for E- Learning and offers a theory-into-practice framework that characterizes the instructional implications of situated cognition and guides the design of E-Learning. Specific examples of how to apply this framework in E- Learning contexts are provided.","authors":["Nada Dabbagh"],"meta":["January 2005"],"references":["243771280_Distributed_learning_communities_an_alternative_to_designed_instructional_systems","234586546_Web-Based_Courseware_Tools_Where_Is_the_Pedagogy","227295128_Instructional_design_for_situated_learning","225471130_Grounded_practice_and_the_design_of_constructivist_learning_environments","200772846_Cognitive_Flexibility_Constructivism_and_Hypertext_Random_Access_Instruction_for_Advanced_Knowledge_Acquisition_in_Ill-Structured_Domains","324311732_A_Study_of_Thinking","319394840_Distributed_cognitions_psychological_and_educational_considerations","313763807_Cognitive_Teaching_Models","302252708_Learning_theory_instructional_theory_and_adaptation","286825708_Pedagogic_roles_and_dynamics_in_telematics_environments","251785524_A_Brief_Introduction_to_Distributed_Cognition","249704521_Cognitive_Modeling_and_Self-Efficacy_Effects_on_Preservice_Teachers'_Learning_of_Teaching_Strategies","249016816_Different_discourses_discourses_of_difference_Globalisation_distance_education_and_open_learning","248114948_Scaffolding_An_important_teacher_competency_in_online_learning","245543085_Cognitive_Psychology_and_Its_Implications","243771910_Developing_understanding_of_the_idea_of_communities_of_learners_Mind_Culture_and_Activity_1_209-229","243763713_Issues_in_hypertext_and_hypermedia_research_Toward_a_framework_for_linking_theory_to_design","243756750_Distance_Education_A_Systems_View","239566560_Constructivism_Implications_for_the_Design_and_Delivery_of_Instruction1","238750552_Objectivism_versus_constructivism_do_we_need_a_new_philosophical_paradigm_educational_technology_research_development","235700798_Human_problem_solving","220040319_Communities_of_Practice_The_Organizational_Frontier","220040297_Psychology_of_Learning_for_Instruction","213798656_Studying_Context_A_Comparison_of_Activity_Theory_Situated_Action_Models_and_Distributed_Cognition","201381863_Emerging_technologies_ISD_and_learning_environments_Critical_perspectives","49176484_Cognitive_apprenticeship_and_instructional_technology","22223090_The_role_of_tutoring_in_problem_solving"]}
