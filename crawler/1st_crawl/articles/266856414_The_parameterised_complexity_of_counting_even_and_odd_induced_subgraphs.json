{"id":"266856414_The_parameterised_complexity_of_counting_even_and_odd_induced_subgraphs","abstract":"We consider the problem of counting, in a given graph, the number of induced\nk-vertex subgraphs which have an even number of edges, and also the\ncomplementary problem of counting the k-vertex induced subgraphs having an odd\nnumber of edges. We demonstrate that both problems are #W[1]-hard when\nparameterised by k, in fact proving a somewhat stronger result about counting\nsubgraphs with a property that only holds for some subset of k-vertex subgraphs\nwhich have an even (respectively odd) number of edges. On the other hand, we\nshow that the problems of counting even and odd k-vertex induced subgraphs both\nadmit an FPTRAS. These approximation schemes are based on a surprising\nstructural result, which exploits ideas from Ramsey theory.","authors":["Mark Jerrum","Kitty Meeks"],"meta":["October 2014Combinatorica","DOI:10.1007/s00493-016-3338-5","SourcearXiv"],"references":["260340939_The_challenges_of_unbounded_treewidth_in_parameterised_subgraph_counting_problems","221544091_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Some_Parameterized_Counting_Problems","4257905_On_Parameterized_Path_and_Chordless_Path_Problems","281740143_Some_Hard_Families_of_Parameterized_Counting_Problems","272675777_A_combinatorial_problem_in_geometry","272391953_The_parameterised_complexity_of_counting_connected_subgraphs_and_graph_motifs","263855888_Complexity_of_Counting_Subgraphs_Only_the_Boundedness_of_the_Vertex-Cover_Number_Counts","262164035_Counting_Matchings_of_Size_k_Is_sharp_W1-Hard","246193402_Finite_Fields_Encyclopedia_of_Mathematics","242985245_On_greatest_common_divisor_matrices_and_their_applications","222538387_On_the_Parameterized_Complexity_of_Multiple-Interval_Graph_Problems","222507592_On_meet_matrices_on_posets","220618044_The_Parameterized_Complexity_of_Counting_Problems","4004066_The_parameterized_complexity_of_counting_problems","2290342_The_Computational_Complexity_of_XOR_AND-Counting_Problems","1919044_A_Complexity_Dichotomy_for_Partition_Functions_with_Mixed_Signs"]}
