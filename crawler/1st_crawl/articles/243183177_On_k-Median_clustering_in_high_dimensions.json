{"id":"243183177_On_k-Median_clustering_in_high_dimensions","abstract":"We study approximation algorithms for k-median clustering. We obtain small coresets for k-median clustering in metric spaces as well as in Euclidean spaces. Specifically, in IR d, those coresets are of size with only polynomial dependency on d. This leads to a (1 + ε)-approximation algorithm for kmedian clustering in IR d , with running time O(ndk + 2 (k/ε)O(1)o) d 2o), for any ∼ > 0. This is an improvement over previous results [5, 20, 21]. We also provide fast constant factor approximation algorithms for kmedian clustering in finite metric spaces. We use those coresets to compute (1 + ε)-approximation k-median clustering in the streaming model of computation, using only O(k 2dε -2 log 8 n) space, where the points are taken from IR d. This is the first streaming algorithm, for this problem, that has space complexity with only polynomial dependency on the dimension.","authors":["Ke Chen"],"meta":["January 2006","DOI:10.1145/1109557.1109687"],"references":["228057623_A_constant-factor_approximation_algorithm_for_the_k-median_problem","221591505_Local_search_heuristic_for_k-median_and_facility_location_problems","220898580_Linear_Time_Algorithms_for_Clustering_Problems_in_Any_Dimensions","220780107_Sublinear_Time_Approximate_Clustering","313061265_Clustering_data_streams","313004660_A_nearly_linear-time_approximation_scheme_for_the_Euclidean_k-median_problem","262392783_A_constant-factor_approximation_algorithm_for_the_k_-median_problem_extended_abstract","262234261_Primal-Dual_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Metric_Facility_Location_and_k-Median_Problems","228892225_Geometric_approximation_via_coresets","226410503_Smaller_Coresets_for_k-Median_and_k-Means_Clustering","222590375_Decomposable_searching_problems_I_Static-to-dynamic_transformation","222473678_Clustering_to_minimize_the_maximum_intercluster_distance","222190436_Decision_Theoretic_Generalizations_of_the_PAC_Model_for_Neural_Net_and_Other_Learning_Applications","221591636_Coresets_in_dynamic_geometric_data_streams","221591527_Better_Streaming_Algorithms_for_Clustering_Problems","221591273_Algorithms_for_dynamic_geometric_problems_over_data_streams","221591136_On_coresets_for_k-means_and_k-median_clustering","221591061_Sublinear_Time_Algorithms_for_Metric_Space_Problems","221499077_A_Simple_Linear_Time_1e-Approximation_Algorithm_for_k-Means_Clustering_in_Any_Dimensions","220430784_Approximation_algorithms_for_metric_facility_location_and","3880912_Clustering_data_streams","2913205_Approximate_Clustering_via_Core-Sets","2902771_Approximating_Extent_Measures_of_Points","2902692_Coresets_for_k-Means_and_k-Median_Clustering_and_their_Applications","2441960_Approximation_schemes_for_Euclidean_k-Medians_And_Related_Problems"]}
