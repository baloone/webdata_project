{"id":"265415193_A_manually-checkable_proof_for_the_NP-hardness_of_11-color_pattern_self-assembly_tile_set_synthesis","abstract":"Patterned self-assembly tile set synthesis (PATS) aims at finding a minimum\ntile set to uniquely self-assemble a given rectangular (color) pattern. For k\n>= 1, k-PATS is a variant of PATS that restricts input patterns to those with\nat most $k$ colors. A computer-assisted proof has been recently proposed for\n2-PATS by Kari et al. [arXiv:1404.0967 (2014)]. In contrast, the best known\nmanually-checkable proof is for the NP-hardness of 29-PATS by Johnsen, Kao, and\nSeki [ISAAC 2013, LNCS 8283, pp.~699-710]. We propose a manually-checkable\nproof for the NP-hardness of 11-PATS.","authors":["Aleck Johnsen","Ming-Yang Kao","Shinnosuke Seki"],"meta":["February 2017Journal of Combinatorial Optimization 33(2)","DOI:10.1007/s10878-015-9975-6","SourcearXiv"],"references":["261597779_Computing_Minimum_Tile_Sets_to_Self-Assemble_Color_Patterns","260127499_A_SAT_Attack_on_the_Erdos_Discrepancy_Conjecture","278096299_Two_computational_primitives_for_algorithmic_self-assembly_Copying_and_counting","268625013_3-Color_Bounded_Patterned_Self-assembly","268245107_The_man_who_loved_only_numbers_The_story_of_Paul_Erdos_and_the_search_for_mathematical_truth","266859846_Combinatorial_Optimization_in_Pattern_Assembly","266704916_DNA_computing_and_molecular_programming_18th_international_conference_DNA_18_Aarhus_Denmark_August_14-17_2012_Proceedings","262984872_Binary_Pattern_Tile_Set_Synthesis_Is_NP-hard","262202473_Synthesizing_Minimal_Tile_Sets_for_Complex_Patterns_in_the_Framework_of_Patterned_DNA_Self-Assembly","259090844_Search_Methods_for_Tile_Sets_in_Patterned_DNA_Self-Assembly","237842959_3-color_Bounded_Patterned_Self-assembly","257628509_Efficient_3-SAT_algorithms_in_the_tile_assembly_model","240291885_The_Complexity_of_Satisfiability_Problems_In_Proc_of","234131309_Combinatorial_Optimization_in_Pattern_Assembly","225046680_Algorithmic_Self-Assembly_of_DNA_Theoretical_Motivations_and_2D_Assembly_Experiments"]}
