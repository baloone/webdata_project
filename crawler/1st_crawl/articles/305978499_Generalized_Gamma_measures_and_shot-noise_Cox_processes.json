{"id":"305978499_Generalized_Gamma_measures_and_shot-noise_Cox_processes","abstract":"A parametric family of completely random measures, which includes gamma random measures, positive stable random measures as well as inverse Gaussian measures, is defined. In order to develop models for clustered point patterns with dependencies between points, the family is used in a shot-noise construction as intensity measures for Cox processes. The resulting Cox processes are of Poisson cluster process type and include Poisson processes and ordinary Neyman-Scott processes.\nWe show characteristics of the completely random measures, illustrated by simulations, and derive moment and mixing properties for the shot-noise random measures. Finally statistical inference for shot-noise Cox processes is considered and some results on nearest-neighbour Markov properties are given.","authors":["Anders Brix"],"meta":["December 1999Advances in Applied Probability 31(04):929-953","DOI:10.1017/S0001867800009538"],"references":["247020626_On_Simulation_from_Infinitely_Divisible_Distributions","242350466_A_Method_for_Simulating_Stable_Random_Variables","266291117_On_Generalized_Shot_Noise","265672350_PoissonGamma_Random_Field_Models_for_Spatial_Statistics","265375218_Nearest-Neighbour_Markov_Point_Processes_and_Random_Sets","265333060_Stochastic_Processes_Directed_by_Randomized_Time","247685566_Survival_models_for_heterogeneous_populations_derived_from_stable_distributions","233377805_A_statistical_study_of_earthquakes_in_the_main_seismic_area_of_New_Zealand_Part_II_time_series_analyses_New_Zeal","233259997_Random_Boolean_Functions_Non-Parametric_Estimation_of_the_Intensity_Application_to_Soil_Surface_Roughness","227701452_Log_Gaussian_Cox_Processes","227076261_Exponential_spaces_and_counting_processes","38362949_Modelling_Heterogeneity_in_Survival_Analysis_by_the_Compound_Poisson_Distribution","38360106_Reproducibility_and_Natural_Exponential_Families_with_Power_Variance_Functions","13807516_Analysis_of_Overdispersed_Count_Data_by_Mixtures_of_Poisson_Variables_and_Poisson_Processes","2437916_Markov_Properties_of_Cluster_Processes"]}
