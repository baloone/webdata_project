{"id":"333736132_Machine_Learning_Based_Field_Data_Analysis_and_Modeling_for_Drone_Communications","abstract":"In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), also called drone, is getting more and more important in many emerging technology areas. For communication area, drone also takes an important role in lots of significant topics like emergency communications, device-to-device (D2D) communications, Internet of Things (IoT) etc. One of the important drone applications is to collect and share data among drones and other aircrafts, which is useful for drone control so that dangerous conditions can be avoided. In particular, the drone control and safety guarantees are difficult to attain, especially when drones fly beyond line of sight (BLOS). For this reason, we develop a drone location information sharing system using 920MHz band. We use this system to do a long distance propagation field experiment for model establishment. Unfortunately, currently the data collection for model establishment work needs great effort and time to do experiments to collect huge number of data for data analysis so that a suitable model can be established. Therefore, in this paper we propose a novel method, which is based on machine learning approach, to data analysis and model establishment for drone communications, so that the effort and cost for establish model can be reduced and a model which captures more details about the drone communications can be obtained. The results of this study validate that the proposed method can indeed establish a more complicated model with less effort. Specifically, from the distribution of the training error, it can be known that, there are over 80% training errors are with intensity less than 5, which ensures the error performance of the proposed method.","authors":["Lin Shan","Ryu Miura","Toshinori Kagawa","Fumie Ono"],"meta":["June 2019IEEE Access PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2922544"],"references":["331539446_DSF-NOMA_UAV-Assisted_Emergency_Communication_Technology_in_a_Heterogeneous_Internet_of_Things","325095062_Feature_Selection-Based_Detection_of_Covert_Cyber_Deception_Assaults_in_Smart_Grid_Communications_Networks_Using_Machine_Learning","324455269_Drone-Based_Highway-VANET_and_DAS_Service","321347258_Big_Data_Analytics_and_Artificial_Intelligence_in_Next-Generation_Wireless_Networks","320557247_Machine-Learning-Based_Throughput_Estimation_Using_Images_for_mmWave_Communications","319349778_Power_of_Deep_Learning_for_Channel_Estimation_and_Signal_Detection_in_OFDM_Systems","313140765_Unmanned_Aircraft_System_Traffic_Management_Concept_of_Operation_and_System_Architecture","283657519_Survey_of_Important_Issues_in_UAV_Communication_Networks","281486941_Unmanned_Aerial_Vehicle_With_Underlaid_Device-to-Device_Communications_Performance_and_Tradeoffs","336571773_Location_Awareness_System_for_Drones_Flying_Beyond_Visual_Line_of_Sight_Exploiting_the_400_MHz_Frequency_Band","331240972_Data-Driven_Deep_Learning_for_Automatic_Modulation_Recognition_in_Cognitive_Radios","330495852_Deep-Learning-based_Millimeter-Wave_Massive_MIMO_for_Hybrid_Precoding","330478005_Echo-State_Restricted_Boltzmann_Machines_A_Perspective_on_Information_Compensation","329975522_Toward_Future_Unmanned_Aerial_Vehicle_Networks_Architecture_Resource_Allocation_and_Field_Experiments","328327690_Design_of_Future_UAV-Relay_Tactical_Data_Link_for_Reliable_UAV_Control_and_Situational_Awareness","327767862_Jointly_Optimized_Extreme_Learning_Machine_for_Short-Term_Prediction_of_Fading_Channel","326076050_Deep_Learning_for_Super-Resolution_Channel_Estimation_and_DOA_Estimation_based_Massive_MIMO_System","324511607_Multiple_Moving_Targets_Surveillance_Based_on_a_Cooperative_Network_for_Multi-UAV","322945544_Unsupervised_machine_learning_in_5G_networks_for_low_latency_communications","320966806_Technical_capability_level_2_unmanned_aircraft_system_traffic_management_UTM_flight_demonstration_Description_and_analysis","319887065_AC-POCA_Anti-Coordination_Game_based_Partially_Overlapping_Channels_Assignment_in_Combined_UAV_and_D2D_based_Networks","308335684_Mobile_Edge_Computing_via_a_UAV-Mounted_Cloudlet_Optimal_Bit_Allocation_and_Path_Planning","291952784_A_dynamic_trajectory_control_algorithm_for_improving_the_communication_throughput_and_delay_in_UAV-aided_networks"]}
