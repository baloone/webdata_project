{"id":"258083389_On_Jacobian_group_arithmetic_for_typical_divisors_on_curves","abstract":"In a previous joint article with F. Abu Salem, we gave efficient algorithms\nfor Jacobian group arithmetic of \"typical\" divisor classes on C_{3,4} curves,\nfollowing the lead of other authors. At the time, we could only state that a\ngeneric divisor is typical, and hence unlikely to be encountered if one\nimplements these algorithms over a very large finite field. This article pins\ndown an explicit sufficient characterization of these typical divisors, and\nproves that if the algorithms in our previous article can be carried out, then\nthis provides a guarantee that the resulting output is correct and that the\nresulting divisor is also typical. The results in this article extend to\narbitrary curves having at least one rational point, hence in particular to all\nC_{a,b} curves. As a byproduct of our work, we obtain a further speedup of\napproximately 15% on our earlier algorithms for C_{3,4} curves.","authors":["Kamal Khuri-Makdisi"],"meta":["January 2018Research in Number Theory 4(1)","DOI:10.1007/s40993-018-0101-6","SourcearXiv"],"references":["220334684_Fast_addition_on_non-hyperelliptic_genus_3","2131756_Fast_Jacobian_group_operations_for_C_34_curves_over_a_large_finite_field","332103593_Group_Arithmetic_on_C_35_curves","308026860_Upper_bounds_for_some_Brill-Noether_loci_over_a_finite_field","257253193_Group_arithmetic_in_C-3C-5_curves","225771651_Implementing_the_Arithmetic_of_C34_Curves","221010711_Fast_Arithmetic_on_Jacobians_of_Picard_Curves","220334307_Fast_arithmetic_on_Jacobians_of_Picard_curves","29604491_The_arithmetic_of_Jacobian_groups_of_superelliptic_cubics","2114770_Asymptotically_fast_group_operations_on_Jacobians_of_general_curves","2098977_Linear_algebra_algorithms_for_divisors_on_an_algebraic_curve"]}
