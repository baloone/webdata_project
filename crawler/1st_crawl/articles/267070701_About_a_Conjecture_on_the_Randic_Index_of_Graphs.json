{"id":"267070701_About_a_Conjecture_on_the_Randic_Index_of_Graphs","abstract":"For an edge uv of a graph G, the weight of the edge e=uv is defined by w(e)=1/d(u)d(v). Then R(G)=∑ uv∈E(G) 1/d(u)d(v)=∑ e∈E(G) w(e) is called the Randić index of G. If G is a connected graph, then rad(G)=min x max y d(x,y) is called the radius of G, where d(x,y) is the distance between two vertices x,y. G. Caporossi and P. Hansen [Discrete Math. 212, No. 1–2, 29–44 (2000; Zbl 0947.90130)] conjectured that for all connected graphs except the even paths, R(G)≥r(G). They proved the conjecture holds for all trees except the even paths. In this paper, it is proved that the conjecture holds for all unicyclic graphs, bicyclic graphs and some class of chemical graphs.","authors":["Liancui Zuo"],"meta":["January 2012The Bulletin of the Malaysian Mathematical Society Series 2 2(2)"],"references":["267437208_On_a_conjecture_on_Randic_indices","257000820_On_a_conjecture_of_the_Randic_index","244436811_On_conjectures_of_Grat","231492064_Correlation_of_Heats_of_Isomerization_and_Differences_in_Heat_of_Vaporization_of_Isomers_Among_the_Paraffin_Hydrocarbons","231473566_On_Characterization_of_Molecular_Branching","225192304_Wiener_Index_of_Trees_Theory_and_Applications","223280996_Variable_neighborhood_search_for_extremal_graphs_1_The_AutoGraphiX_system","222228494_Variable_neighborhood_search_for_extremal_graphs_5_Three_ways_to_automate_finding_conjectures","220189896_Extremal_graphs_for_weights","220188748_On_conjectures_of_Graffiti_III","10933792_Variable_Neighborhood_Search_for_Extremal_Graphs_6_Analyzing_Bounds_for_the_Connectivity_Index"]}
