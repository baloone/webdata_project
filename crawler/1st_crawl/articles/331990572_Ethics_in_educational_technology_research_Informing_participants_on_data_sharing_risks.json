{"id":"331990572_Ethics_in_educational_technology_research_Informing_participants_on_data_sharing_risks","abstract":"Participants in educational technology research regularly share personal data which carries with it risks. Informing participants of these data sharing risks is often only done so through text contained within a consent form. However, conceptualizations of data sharing risks and knowledge of responsible data management practices among teachers and learners may be impoverished—limiting the effectiveness of a consent form in communicating such risks in a manner that adequately supports participants in making informed decisions about sharing their data. At two high schools participating in an educational research project involving the use of technology in the classroom, we investigate teacher and student conceptions of data sharing risks and knowledge of responsible data management practices; and introduce a communication approach that attempts to better inform educational technology research participants of such risks. Results of this study suggest that most teachers have not received formal training related to responsibly managing data; and both teachers and students see the need for such training as they come to realize that their understanding of responsible data management is underdeveloped. Thus, efforts beyond solely explaining data sharing risks in an informed consent form may be needed in educational technology research to facilitate ethical self‐determination.","authors":["Marc Beardsley","Patricia Santos","Hernández-Leo Davinia","Konstantinos Michos"],"meta":["March 2019British Journal of Educational Technology 50(6)","DOI:10.1111/bjet.12781"],"references":["321959135_Normative_Challenges_of_Identification_in_the_Internet_of_Things_Privacy_Profiling_Discrimination_and_the_GDPR","318671211_The_spread_of_fake_news_by_social_bots","293415524_Privacy_and_Analytics_-_it's_a_DELICATE_Issue_A_Checklist_for_Trusted_Learning_Analytics","283410655_Ethics_in_e-learning","278412929_Meaningful_informed_consent_with_young_children_looking_forward_through_an_interactive_narrative_approach","273951205_Student_privacy_self-management_implications_for_learning_analytics","271829499_Understanding_Privacy_Online_Development_of_a_Social_Contract_Approach_to_Privacy","260762371_Our_anonymous_online_research_participants_are_not_always_anonymous_Is_this_a_problem","260411126_A_Cognitive_View_of_Reading_Comprehension_Implications_for_Reading_Difficulties","258122968_Learning_Analytics_Ethical_Issues_and_Dilemmas","251567961_Improving_understanding_in_the_research_informed_consent_process_A_systematic_review_of_54_interventions_tested_in_randomized_control_trials","249022562_Learning_New_Information_from_Text_The_Role_of_Prior_Knowledge_and_Reading_Ability","230587300_Updating_During_Reading_Comprehension_Why_Causality_Matters","225248944_The_Right_to_Informational_Self-Determination_and_the_Value_of_Self-Development_Reassessing_the_Importance_of_Privacy_for_Democracy","42806700_Interventions_to_Improve_Patient_Comprehension_in_Informed_Consent_for_Medical_and_Surgical_Procedures_A_Systematic_Review","23223978_Making_a_difference_Incorporating_theories_of_autonomy_into_models_of_informed_consent","8566430_The_effect_of_format_modifications_and_reading_comprehension_on_recall_of_informed_consent_information_by_low-income_parents_A_comparison_of_print_video_and_computer-based_presentations","8248721_Interventions_to_Improve_Research_Participants'_Understanding_in_Informed_Consent_for_Research_A_Systematic_Review","5784825_The_effects_of_prior_knowledge_and_text_structure_on_comprehension_processes_during_reading_of_scientific_texts","329637819_Ethical_and_Legal_Foundations_of_Relational_Marketing_Exchanges","327694543_Teacher-led_inquiry_in_technology-supported_school_communities","324702232_Informed_consent_and_secondary_data_Reflections_on_the_use_of_mothers'_blogs_in_social_media_research","324238500_Supporting_awareness_in_communities_of_learning_design_practice","320198394_Authoring_and_enactment_of_mobile_pyramid-based_collaborative_learning_activities","318949428_The_illusion_of_personal_data_as_no_one's_property","316640824_More_a_marathon_than_a_hurdle_towards_children's_informed_consent_in_a_study_on_safety","315350361_Downstream_Consent_A_Better_Legal_Framework_for_Big_Data","314104903_Student_perceptions_of_their_privacy_in_leaning_analytics_applications","286815671_How_reading_comprehension_is_embodied_and_why_that_matters","275779047_A_History_and_Theory_Of_Informed_Consent","271846339_Informed_Consent_with_Children_and_Young_People_in_Social_Research_Is_There_Scope_for_Innovation","265316489_The_age_of_Big_Data","262293023_Learning_analytics_Drivers_developments_and_challenges","261544712_Children_and_School-Based_Research_'Informed_Consent'_or_'Educated_Consent'","261331318_Ethical_and_Privacy_Principles_for_Learning_Analytics","256650108_Interventions_to_improve_research_participants'_understanding_in_informed_consent_for_research_A_systematic_review","235361217_Ethical_and_Legal_Foundations_of_Relational_Marketing_Exchanges","231740089_Justifying_Community_Benefit_Requirements_in_International_Research","229803145_Negotiating_Informed_Consent_with_Children_in_School-Based_Research_A_Critical_Review","227617372_Ethical_issues_in_Computer-Assisted_Language_Learning_Perceptions_of_teachers_and_learners","222511956_Contextual_Prerequisites_for_Understanding_Some_Investigations_of_Comprehension_and_Recall1","221813915_The_quality_of_informed_consent_Mapping_the_landscape_A_review_of_empirical_data_from_developing_and_developed_countries","51876964_A_Contextual_Approach_to_Privacy_Online","51789301_The_Fair_Transaction_Model_of_Informed_Consent_An_Alternative_to_Autonomous_Authorization"]}
