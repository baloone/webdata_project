{"id":"332075110_DNA_Sequence_Based_Medical_Image_Encryption_Scheme","abstract":"Medical consultants and doctors store and update patients confidential information on Internet cloud computing platforms. These days, securing medical images from eavesdroppers is one of the most challenging and significant research areas. Due to various attacks from eavesdroppers, medical images need to be store and send in the encrypted format. In order to secure medical image data from unauthorised access, a DNA (Deoxyri-bonucleic acid) sequence based medical image encryption scheme is proposed. First of all, for a given value of DNA sequence, a hash value via SHA-512 is computed. This hash value is given as a secret key to the Intertwining Logistic map. Through chaotic sequences, the correlation among pixels is reduced using shuffling process. The shuffled image is XORed with the chaotic random values for the diffusion. Finally, the affine transformation is applied to the diffused image. Extensive and detailed security analyses reveal the importance and advantages of the proposed scheme when compared to other conventional image encryption schemes.","authors":["Jan Sher Khan","Jawad Ahmad","Saadullah Farooq Abbasi"," Arshad"],"meta":["September 2018","DOI:10.1109/CEEC.2018.8674221","Conference: 2018 10th Computer Science and Electronic Engineering (CEEC)","Project: Secure Image Encryption"],"references":["320971416_A_new_technique_for_designing_8_8_substitution_box_for_image_encryption_applications","320598406_A_novel_image_encryption_based_on_Lorenz_equation_Gingerbreadman_chaotic_map_and_S8_permutation","319413462_A_novel_substitution_box_for_encryption_based_on_Lorenz_equations","319241736_Chaotic_Image_Encryption_Algorithm_Based_on_Bit_Permutation_and_Dynamic_DNA_Encoding","317389010_Secure_speech_communication_algorithm_via_DCT_and_TD-ERCS_chaotic_map","316525838_A_novel_image_encryption_scheme_based_on_orthogonal_matrix_skew_tent_map_and_XOR_operation","315062629_Image_Encryption_Algorithm_Based_on_Hyperchaotic_Maps_and_Nucleotide_Sequences_Database","309469292_An_efficient_and_secure_partial_image_encryption_for_wireless_multimedia_sensor_networks_using_discrete_wavelet_transform_chaotic_maps_and_substitution_box","307590028_TD-ERCS_map-based_confusion_and_diffusion_of_autocorrelated_data","305765546_A_novel_construction_of_substitution_box_for_image_encryption_applications_with_Gingerbreadman_chaotic_map_and_S8_permutation"]}
