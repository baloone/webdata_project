{"id":"221677406_Span_Programs_and_Quantum_Algorithms_for_st-Connectivity_and_Claw_Detection","abstract":"We introduce a span program that decides st-connectivity, and generalize the\nspan program to develop quantum algorithms for several graph problems. First,\nwe give an algorithm for st-connectivity that uses O(n d^{1/2}) quantum queries\nto the n x n adjacency matrix to decide if vertices s and t are connected,\nunder the promise that they either are connected by a path of length at most d,\nor are disconnected. We also show that if T is a path, a star with two\nsubdivided legs, or a subdivision of a claw, its presence as a subgraph in the\ninput graph G can be detected with O(n) quantum queries to the adjacency\nmatrix. Under the promise that G either contains T as a subgraph or does not\ncontain T as a minor, we give O(n)-query quantum algorithms for detecting T\neither a triangle or a subdivision of a star. All these algorithms can be\nimplemented time efficiently and, except for the triangle-detection algorithm,\nin logarithmic space. One of the main techniques is to modify the\nst-connectivity span program to drop along the way \"breadcrumbs,\" which must be\nretrieved before the path from s is allowed to enter t.","authors":["Aleksandrs Belovs","Ben W.
