{"id":"220843610_Computing_Similarity_Among_3D_Objects_Using_Dynamic_Time_Warping","abstract":"A new model to compute similarity is presented. The representation of a 3D object is reviewed; sequence of vertices and index\nof vertices are the basic information about the shape of any 3D object. A linear function called Labeling is introduced to create a new sequence or time series from a 3D object. A method to create randomly 3D objects is also described. Experimental results show viability to compute similarity among 3D objects using the extracted\nsequences and the Dynamic Time Warping algorithm.","authors":["A. Angeles-Yreta","J.
