{"id":"320397589_Human_Rights_without_human_supremacism","abstract":"Early defenders of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights invoked species hierarchy: human beings are owed rights because of our discontinuity with and superiority to animals. Subsequent defenders avoided species supremacism, appealing instead to conditions of embodied subjectivity and corporeal vulnerability we share with animals. In the past decade, however, supremacism has returned in work of the new ‘dignitarians’ who argue that human rights are grounded in dignity, and that human dignity requires according humans a higher status than animals. Against the dignitarians, I argue that defending human rights on the backs of animals is philosophically suspect and politically self-defeating.","authors":["Will Kymlicka"],"meta":["October 2017Canadian Journal of Philosophy","DOI:10.1080/00455091.2017.1386481"],"references":["345724062_What's_So_Special_About_Human_Dignity","328913172_Animal_Rights_and_Aboriginal_Rights","347534229_Dignity_Its_History_and_Meaning","346833166_Wildspace","345716430_Humanity_without_Dignity_Moral_Equality_Respect_and_Human_Rights","345242403_Kinship_and_Killing_The_Animal_in_World_Religions","345053579_The_Rights_of_Animals_and_Unborn_Generations","333944732_Human_Dignity","327655384_Making_Sense_of_Human_Rights_University_of_California_Press_1987_250_pages_Translated_into_Indonesian_and_published_as_Hak_Asasi_Manusia_Jakarta_Gramedia_1996","326956880_Awe_for_the_tiger_love_for_the_lamb_A_chronicle_of_sensibility_to_animals"]}
