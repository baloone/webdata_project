{"id":"318892563_A_relativistic_coupled-cluster_interaction_potential_and_rovibrational_constants_for_the_xenon_dimer","abstract":"An accurate potential energy curve has been derived for the xenon dimer using state-of-the-art relativistic coupled-cluster theory up to quadruple excitations accounting for both basis set superposition and incompleteness errors. The data obtained is fitted to a computationally efficient extended Lennard-Jones potential form and to a modified Tang–Toennies potential function treating the short- and long-range part separately. The vibrational spectrum of Xe2 obtained from a numerical solution of the rovibrational Schrödinger equation and subsequently derived spectroscopic constants are in excellent agreement with experimental values. We further present solid-state calculations for xenon using a static many-body expansion up to fourth-order in the xenon interaction potential including dynamic effects within the Einstein approximation. Again we find very good agreement with the experimental (face-centred cubic) lattice constant and cohesive energy.","authors":["Paul Jerabek","Odile Smits","Elke Pahl","Peter
