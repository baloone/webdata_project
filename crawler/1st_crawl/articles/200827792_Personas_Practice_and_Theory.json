{"id":"200827792_Personas_Practice_and_Theory","abstract":"Personas is an interaction design technique with considerable potential for software product development. In three years of use, our colleagues and we have extended Alan Cooper s technique to make Personas a powerful complement to other usability methods. After describing and illustrating our approach, we outline the psychological theory that explains why Personas are more engaging than design based primarily on scenarios. As Cooper and others have observed, Personas can engage team members very effectively. They also provide a conduit for conveying a broad range of qualitative and quantitative data, and focus attention on aspects of design and use that other methods do not.","authors":["John Pruitt","Jonathan Grudin"],"meta":["June 2003","DOI:10.1145/997078.997089","Conference: Proceedings of the 2003 Conference on Designing for User Experiences"],"references":["234803027_Contextual_Design","221441576_From_user_to_character_an_investigation_into_user-descriptions_in_scenarios","221248300_Personas_in_Action_Ethnography_in_an_Interaction_Design_Team","264752435_User_and_task_analysis_for_interface_design","248516597_Theory_of_mind_development_and_social_understanding_Cognition_and_Emotion_92-3_151-165","248435886_Who''s_on_the_other_side_of_your_software_Creating_user_profiles_through_contextual_inquiry","247697962_Taking_the_you_out_of_user_My_experience_using_Personas","247357131_Reconciling_market_segments_and_Personas","247167435_Personas_and_contextual_design","245588890_Bringing_your_Personas_to_life_in_real_life","239644444_Goal-directed_methods_for_great_design","238293550_Personas_Matching_a_design_to_the_users''goals","235700654_Incorporating_user_archetypes_into_scenario-based_design","232003352_Does_a_chimpanzee_have_a_theory_of_mind","228594908_Personas_Participatory_Design_and_Product_Development_An_Infrastructure_for_Engagement","224927513_Making_Use_-_Scenario-Based_Design_of_Human-Computer_Interactions","222534148_Scenarios_in_user-centred_design-Setting_the_stage_for_reflection_and_action","221441528_Interaction_Relabelling_and_Extreme_Characters_Methods_for_Exploring_Aesthetic_Interactions","220756807_The_Inmates_Are_Running_the_Asylum","220286401_Organizational_Obstacles_to_Interface_Design_and_Development_Two_Participant-Observer_Studies","220054490_Scenarios_and_the_HCI-SE_design_problem","220041243_Crossing_the_Chasm","3229137_User_and_task_analysis_for_interface_design"]}
