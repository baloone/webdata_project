{"id":"338071772_An_Efficient_Ensemble_Method_for_Cancer_Detection","abstract":"Very few diseases are as deadly as Breast cancer\nand Lung cancer that causes a high percentage of deaths every\nyear. Data mining approach works quite effectively in diagnosing\ncancer. This has been possible mainly because of the potential\nof classification systems that has been improved in a great\narrangement in helping medical experts. In this research work,\ndata mining has been applied for the diagnosis of cancer. For the\npurpose of that, an ensemble method has been used to extract\nthe most important features in detecting cancer and classify\nthe pattern of cancer according to the most influential features.\nFor feature extraction the advantages of Principal Component\nAnalysis (PCA), Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) and Chi\nSquare (Chi2) have been considered using set union operation.\nBy the help of the hybrid model of feature extraction, and\nclassification, Naive Bayes, K Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree\n(J48, ID3) classifiers were used to classify the model. Results from\nindividual classifiers have been voted by majority voting to obtain\nthe best possible outcome. k- fold cross validation (10 and 5 folds)\nand train (80% and 70%) test (20% and 30%) split have been\napplied to examine the performance of the model(AEEMCD).","authors":["Md.
