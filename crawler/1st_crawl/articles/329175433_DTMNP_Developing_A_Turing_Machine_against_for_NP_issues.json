{"id":"329175433_DTMNP_Developing_A_Turing_Machine_against_for_NP_issues","abstract":"A basic question that is unsolved in theoretical issues of computer science is NP problems. These problems are interlinked with P issues. In our paper we search for developing a Turing machine that can execute an algorithm for these deep complex issues. Although it is a bit hardware related solutions .our paper we focus on developing an analogy that can describe non-deterministic solutions. An aim to discuss possibilities of analogical transformation for a complex, powerful machine with solid state properties.","authors":["Muhammad Aamir Panhwar","Sijjad Ali Khuhro","Tehseen Mazhar","Salahuddin Saddar"],"meta":["November 2018"],"references":["220423686_The_Status_of_the_P_versus_NP_problem","37457200_The_Liquid_Computer_A_Novel_Strategy_for_Real-Time_Computing_on_Time_Series"]}
