{"id":"332141487_The_Human_Network_How_Your_Social_Position_Determines_Your_Power_Beliefs_and_Behaviors","abstract":"I discuss how a handful of simple and quantifiable features of human networks yield enormous insight into why we behave the way we do. Two threads are interwoven: why human networks have special features, and how those features determine our power, opinions, opportunities, behaviors, and accomplishments. Some of the topics included are: the different ways in which a person's position in a network determines their influence; which systematic errors we make when forming opinions based on what we learn from our friends; how financial contagions work and why are they different from the spread of a flu; how splits in our social networks feed inequality, immobility, and polarization; and how network patterns of trade and globalization are changing international conflict and wars. The book is non-technical, with no equations but many pictures, and is full of rich examples and cases that illustrate the points.","authors":["Matthew O.
