{"id":"256937542_Solving_0-1_knapsack_problems_based_on_amoeboid_organism_algorithm","abstract":"The 0-1 knapsack problem is an open issue in discrete optimization problems, which plays an important role in real applications. In this paper, a new bio-inspired model is proposed to solve this problem. The proposed method has three main steps. First, the 0-1 knapsack problem is converted into a directed graph by the network converting algorithm. Then, for the purpose of using the amoeboid organism model, the longest path problem is transformed into the shortest path problem. Finally, the shortest path problem can be well handled by the amoeboid organism algorithm. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed model.","authors":["Xiaoge Zhang","Shiyan Huang","Yong Hu","Yajuan Zhang"],"meta":["June 2013Applied Mathematics and Computation 219(19):9959â€“9970","DOI:10.1016/j.amc.2013.04.023"],"references":["238875249_A_survey_of_effective_heuristics_and_their_application_to_a_variety_of_knapsack_problems","238823756_Intelligence_Maze-Solving_by_an_Amoeboid_Organism","228461699_The_Knapsack-Lightening_problem_and_its_application_to_scheduling_HRT_tasks","226700167_The_Knapsack_Sharing_Problem_An_Exact_Algorithm","221157083_Particle_Swarm_Optimization_for_the_Multidimensional_Knapsack_Problem","220199602_Fuzzy_Dijkstra_algorithm_for_shortest_path_problem_under_uncertain_environment","41111573_Rules_for_Biologically_Inspired_Adaptive_Network_Design","302942656_The_particle_swarm_optimization_algorithm_Convergence_analysis_and_parameter_selection","294696897_Using_watering_algorithm_to_find_the_optimal_paths_of_a_maze","266080011_The_knapsack_sharing_problem_A_tree_search_exact_algorithm","260345487_Modeling_and_Restraining_Mobile_Virus_Propagation","257640237_A_condensation-based_application_of_Cramer's_rule_for_solving_large-scale_linear_systems","257636338_A_biologically_inspired_solution_for_fuzzy_shortest_path_problems","257636316_Chemical_reaction_optimization_with_greedy_strategy_for_the_0-1_knapsack_problem","257636146_QoS_decomposition_for_service_composition_using_genetic_algorithm","256936533_The_three-dimensional_knapsack_problem_with_balancing_constraints","250305715_A_Modified_Binary_Particle_Swarm_Optimization_for_Knapsack_Problems","241103183_A_capital_budgeting_problem_for_preventing_workplace_mobbing_by_using_analytic_hierarchy_process_and_fuzzy_0-1_bidimensional_knapsack_model","237334483_IFSJSP_A_novel_methodology_for_the_Job-Shop_Scheduling_Problem_based_on_intuitionistic_fuzzy_sets","237314739_Route_selection_for_emergency_logistics_management_A_bio-inspired_algorithm","232619928_Solution_to_01_Knapsack_Problem_Based_on_Improved_Ant_Colony_Algorithm","229397173_Development_of_a_hybrid_dynamic_programming_approach_for_solving_discrete_nonlinear_knapsack_problems","227608325_A_genetic_algorithm_for_the_two-dimensional_knapsack_problem_with_rectangular_pieces","226952778_Beasley_JE_A_Genetic_Algorithm_for_the_Multidimensional_Knapsack_Problem_Journal_of_Heuristics_4_63-86","224193398_Network_Immunization_with_Distributed_Autonomy-Oriented_Entities","223816802_A_dynamic_programming_based_procedure_for_the_multidimensional_0-1_knapsack_problem","223589414_Assessing_solution_quality_of_biobjective_0-1_knapsack_problem_using_evolutionary_and_heuristic_algorithms","223511243_Resource_allocation_on_computational_grids_using_a_utility_model_and_the_knapsack_problem","223326494_An_exact_algorithm_for_the_knapsack_sharing_problem","223009378_Selection_among_ranked_projects_under_segmentation_policy_and_logical_constraints","222815232_An_improved_typology_of_cutting_and_packing_problems","222584120_Trelea_IC_The_Particle_Swarm_Optimization_Algorithm_convergence_analysis_and_parameter_selection_Information_Processing_Letters_85_317-325","222367720_Path_finding_by_tube_morphogenesis_in_an_amoeboid_organism","222061242_Solving_0-1_knapsack_problem_by_a_novel_global_harmony_search_algorithm","221563772_A_Linear-Time_Solution_to_the_Knapsack_Problem_Using_P_Systems_with_Active_Membranes","220690835_Network_Flows_Theory_Algorithms_and_Applications","220565034_Exact_algorithm_for_bi-objective_0-1_knapsack_problem","220564117_A_new_hybrid_method_for_solving_global_optimization_problem","220563623_A_surface-based_DNA_algorithm_for_the_solving_binary_knapsack_problem","220562667_An_effective_genetic_algorithm_approach_to_large_scale_mixed_integer_programming_problems","220561821_Dynamic_programming_based_algorithms_for_the_discounted_0-1_knapsack_problem","220559140_Solving_the_bi-objective_multi-dimensional_knapsack_problem_exploiting_the_concept_of_core","220472260_A_new_ant_colony_optimization_algorithm_for_the_multidimensional_Knapsack_problem","220471611_Solving_bicriteria_0-1_knapsack_problems_using_a_labeling_algorithm","220224231_Fully_Polynomial_Approximation_Schemes_for_a_Symmetric_Quadratic_Knapsack_Problem_and_its_Scheduling_Applications","220090599_Algorithms_for_the_bounded_set-up_knapsack_problem","41221865_Solving_efficiently_the_0-1_multi-objective_knapsack_problem","24188333_Multidimensional_Knapsack_Problem_A_Fitness_Landscape_Analysis","6726232_A_mathematical_model_for_adaptive_transport_network_in_path_finding_by_true_slime_mold","3414498_Multidimensional_Knapsack_Problem_A_Fitness_Landscape_Analysis","3414253_Learning_Automata-Based_Solutions_to_the_Nonlinear_Fractional_Knapsack_Problem_With_Applications_to_Optimal_Resource_Allocation"]}
