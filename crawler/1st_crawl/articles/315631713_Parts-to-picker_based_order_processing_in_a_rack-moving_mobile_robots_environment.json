{"id":"315631713_Parts-to-picker_based_order_processing_in_a_rack-moving_mobile_robots_environment","abstract":"This paper treats a special parts-to-picker based order processing system, where mobile robots hoist racks and bring them directly to stationary pickers. This technological innovation – known as the Kiva system – heavily influences all traditional planning problems to be solved when operating a warehouse. We, specifically, tackle the order processing in a picking station, i.e., the batching and sequencing of picking orders and the interdependent sequencing of the racks brought to a station. We formalize the resulting decision problem and provide suited solution procedures. In a comprehensive computational study we show that an optimized order picking allows to more than halve the fleet of robots compared to simple decision rules often applied in real-world warehouses.","authors":["Nils Boysen","Dirk Briskorn","Simon Emde"],"meta":["March 2017European Journal of Operational Research","DOI:10.1016/j.ejor.2017.03.053"],"references":["265015383_Zellulare_Transportfahrzeuge_fur_flexible_und_wandelbare_Intralogistiksysteme_Cellular_Transport_Vehicles_for_Flexible_and_Changeable_Facility_Logistics_Systems","227061666_Computing_the_Initial_Temperature_of_Simulated_Annealing","222544531_Design_and_Control_of_Warehouse_Order_Picking_A_Literature_Review","222542246_A_survey_of_literature_on_automated_storage_and_retrieval_systems","32024632_Mutiple_Order_Pick_Sequencing_in_a_Carousel_System_A_Solvable_Case_of_the_Rural_Postman_Problem","312617088_Simulated_annealing","304778997_Estimating_Performance_in_a_Robotic_Mobile_Fulfillment_System","284490258_Cube-per-order_index_-_A_key_to_warehouse_stock_location","268334678_Intractability_of_Optimal_Multi-Robot_Path_Planning_on_Planar_Graphs","247814037_The_complexity_of_scheduling_short_tasks_with_few_starting_times","245315203_A_throughput_model_for_carouselVLM_pods","235417872_On_some_Matching_Sroblems_Arising_in_Vehicle_Scheduling_Models","234780689_Correlated_assignment_strategy_can_improve_order-picking_operation","234544416_The_Harpy_Speech_Recognition_System_PhD_thesis","229360685_A_robust_design_of_simulated_annealing_approach_for_mixed-model_sequencing","229014347_Allocating_space_in_a_forward_pick_area_of_a_distribution_center_for_small_parts","228072881_Decentralized_Traffic_Control_for_Non-Holonomic_Flexible_Automated_Guided_Vehicles_in_Industrial_Environments","228057735_Computers_And_Intractability_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness","224353228_Future_challenges_of_coordinating_hundreds_of_autonomous_vehicles_in_distribution_facilities","223045263_Survey_of_research_in_the_design_and_control_of_automated_guided_vehicle_systems_European_Journal_of_Operational_Research_170_677-709","222583632_On_the_complexity_of_scheduling_tasks_with_discrete_starting_times","222293486_Finding_a_feasible_course_schedule_using_Tabu_search","220604855_Coordinating_Hundreds_of_Cooperative_Autonomous_Vehicles_in_Warehouses","220407055_Complexity_Results_for_Scheduling_Tasks_with_Discrete_Starting_Times","220045421_Optimization_by_simulated_annealing","46491573_Research_on_warehouse_design_and_performance_evaluation_A_comprehensive_review","3001558_Three_Engineers_Hundreds_of_Robots_One_Warehouse"]}
