{"id":"315910131_The_1-good-neighbor_connectivity_and_diagnosability_of_Cayley_graphs_generated_by_complete_graphs","abstract":"Diagnosability is a significant metric to measure the reliability of multiprocessor systems. In 2012, a new measure for fault tolerance of the system was proposed by Peng et al. This measure is called the -good-neighbor diagnosability that restrains every fault-free node to contain at least fault-free neighbors. The Cayley graph generated by the complete graph has many good properties as other Cayley graphs. In this paper, we show that the connectivity of is , the 1-good-neighbor connectivity of is and the -good-neighbor diagnosability of under the PMC model is for and under the model is for .","authors":["Mujiangshan Wang","Yuqing Lin","Shiying Wang"],"meta":["March 2017Discrete Applied Mathematics 246(4)","DOI:10.1016/j.dam.2017.02.023"],"references":["284142960_A_comparison_connection_assignment_for_self-diagnosis_of_multiprocessor_systems","273523144_The_g-Good-Neighbor_Conditional_Diagnosability_of_k-Ary_n-Cubes_under_the_PMC_Model_and_MM_Model","256694106_Fault-tolerant_Hamiltonian_laceability_of_Cayley_graphs_generated_by_transposition_trees","224709501_Conditional_Fault_Diagnosis_of_Bubble_Sort_Graphs_under_the_PMC_Model","3044866_Conditional_diagnosability_measures_for_large_multiprocessor_systems","301248292_The_g-good-neighbor_conditional_diagnosability_of_n-dimensional_hypercubes_under_the_MM_model","299344525_The_2-good-neighbor_diagnosability_of_Cayley_graphs_generated_by_transposition_trees_under_the_PMC_model_and_MM_model","295254875_G-Good-neighbor_conditional_diagnosability_measures_for_3-ary_n-cube_networks","286378923_The_1-good-neighbor_diagnosability_of_Cayley_graphs_generated_by_transposition_trees_under_the_PMC_model_and_MM_model","277970903_Conditional_fault_tolerance_in_a_class_of_Cayley_graphs","268753224_Diameters_of_Cayley_graphs_generated_by_transposition_trees","260585389_The_Conditional_Diagnosability_of_k-Ary_n-Cubes_under_the_Comparison_Diagnosis_Model","256721434_Diagnosability_of_Cayley_graphs_generated_by_transposition_trees_with_missing_edges","235221604_A_kind_of_conditional_vertex_connectivity_of_star_graphs","221132175_The_Diagnosability_of_g-good-neighbor_Conditional-Faulty_Hypercube_under_PMC_Model","220513766_Orienting_Cayley_graphs_generated_by_transposition_trees","220329229_A_Group-Theoretic_Model_for_Symmetric_Interconnection_Networks","220314418_Linearly_many_faults_in_Cayley_graphs_generated_by_transposition_trees","220295209_Diagnosability_of_Crossed_Cubes_under_the_Comparison_Diagnosis_Model","220115200_Conditional_connectivity_of_Cayley_graphs_generated_by_transposition_trees","40720810_Bipancyclic_properties_of_Cayley_graphs_generated_by_transpositions","3477231_On_the_Connection_Assignment_Problem_of_Diagnosable_Systems","3048452_An_0n25_Fault_Identification_Algorithm_for_Diagnosable_Systems","3043034_On_Self-Diagnosable_Multiprocessor_Systems_Diagnosis_by_the_Comparison_Approach"]}
