{"id":"295861465_EDUCATION_IN_INFORMATICS_AND_SOFTWARE_ENGINEERING_DEVELOPMENT_AND_FUTURE_DIRECTIONS","abstract":"This paper traces the development of teaching informatics and software engineering in Bulgarian higher education, which follows and pursues professional and scientific development of these areas. Prerequisites are analysed of software engineering to evolve from a discipline to bachelors and masters degree programmes. A review is made of developments and trends in the methods and tools for creation and implementation of software in the terms of software production. A model was developed based on critical analysis and evaluation, revealing prospects for future education in informatics and software engineering. Several levels of training are presented with different abstraction and difficulty called „Software practices“, „Object-oriented approaches, techniques and practises of software development“, „Modelling, creation, and application of software processes“, and „Management and implementation of software projects“.","authors":["Hristo Toshkov Hristov","Hristo Krushkov"],"meta":["September 2015","Project: EDUCATION IN INFORMATICS AND SOFTWARE ENGINEERING"],"references":["292542090_Agile_Software_Development_Methods_Review_and_Analysis","221329933_Iterative_Multi-Level_Modeling_-_A_Methodology_for_Computer_System_Design","328730859_What_Every_Engineer_Should_Know_about_Software_Engineering","319393772_Thinking_in_Java","247570937_Software_Engineering_4th_Edition","242547244_A_comparison_of_software_development_methodologies","238722494_Successful_Development_Strategies_for_Business_Application_Systems","238720532_Report_on_a_conference_sponsored_by_the_NATO_Science_Committee","226562126_Traditional_iterative_and_component-based_development_A_social_analysis_of_software_development_paradigms","221554899_Process_Models_Process_Programs_Programming_Support"]}
