This combining contributed to the high computational efficiency. Another advantage of the algorithm is its high efficiency when small-sized documents are compared. The practical use of the algorithm makes it possible to improve the quality of the detection of plagiarism. Also, this algorithm can be used in different systems text search.","authors":["Natalya Shakhovska","Iryna Shvorob"],"meta":["September 2015","DOI:10.1109/STC-CSIT.2015.7325453","Conference: Computer sciences and Information TechnologiesAt: Lviv, Ukraine","Project: Computer Science and Information Technologies Conference CSIT 2017"],"references":[]}
