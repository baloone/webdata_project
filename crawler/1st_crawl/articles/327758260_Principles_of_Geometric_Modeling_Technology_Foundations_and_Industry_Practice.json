{"id":"327758260_Principles_of_Geometric_Modeling_Technology_Foundations_and_Industry_Practice","abstract":"The three-dimensional geometry of a building is a vital prerequisite for Building Information Modeling. This chapter examines the principles involved in representing geometry with a computer. It details explicit and implicit approaches to describing volumetricmodels as well as the basic principles of parametricmodeling for creating flexible, adaptable models. The chapter concludes with an examination of freeform curves and surfaces and their underlying mathematical description. Â© Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.
