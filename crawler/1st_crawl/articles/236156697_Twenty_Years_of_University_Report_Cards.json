{"id":"236156697_Twenty_Years_of_University_Report_Cards","abstract":"Over 20 years ago, the first university rankings entered public attention in the United States. Since then, there have been numerous other efforts to rank or rate universities or university departments. University report cards have become both popular with the public and increasingly important for academic institutions. A detailed examination of 10 report cards from around the world, which evaluate and focus on either undergraduate choice or overall standing, finds that the various schemes share broad principles and approaches but differ considerably in details. Many of these variations are attributable to differences in aims, higher education systems and cultures, and the availability and reliability of data.","authors":["Nina Van Dyke","Nina"],"meta":["July 2005Higher Education in Europe 30(2):103-125","DOI:10.1080/03797720500260173"],"references":["263491304_Summary_Report_of_the_Invitational_Roundtable_on_Statistical_Indicators_for_the_Quality_Assessment_of_HigherTertiary_Education_Institutions_Ranking_and_League_Table_Methodologies","248232300_University_Rankings_in_Japan","246163805_Fantasy_Higher_Education_University_and_College_League_Tables","243785312_League_Tables_and_Their_Limitations_Statistical_Issues_in_Comparisons_of_Institutional_Performance","240523710_The_Use_of_University_Rankings_in_the_United_Kingdom","240440945_Ascription_or_Productivity_The_Determinants_of_Departmental_Success_in_the_NRC_Quality_Ratings","240252116_Some_Guidelines_for_Academic_Quality_Rankings","238523663_Using_Organizational_Report_Cards","233688434_Data_Envelopment_Analysis_and_University_Selection","233587181_The_Ranking_of_Higher_Education_Institutions_in_Russia_Some_Methodological_Problems"]}
