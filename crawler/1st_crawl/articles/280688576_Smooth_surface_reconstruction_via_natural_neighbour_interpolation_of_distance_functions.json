{"id":"280688576_Smooth_surface_reconstruction_via_natural_neighbour_interpolation_of_distance_functions","abstract":"We present an algorithm to reconstruct smooth surfaces of arbitrary topology from unorganised sample points and normals. The method uses natural neighbour interpolation, works in any dimension and accommodates nonuniform samples. The reconstructed surface interpolates the data points and is implicitly represented as the zero set of some pseudo-distance function. It can be meshed so as to satisfy a user-defined error bound, which makes the method especially relevant for small point sets. Experimental results are presented for surfaces in ‚Ñù3.","authors":["Jean-Daniel Boissonnat","F.
