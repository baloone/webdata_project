{"id":"286167200_Cyber_Crime_Risk_Awareness_in_Kyrgyz_Republic","abstract":"In this paper we present the information security awareness rate of students in Kyrgyz Republic, where there is a rapid pace of formation and development of the information society. The survey was conducted with a sample of 172 students from different departments. Our research study showed that despite the huge number of reports about computer crimes in the web, the knowledge about cybercrime is quite low and students are mostly not aware of many aspects of computer crime. Analysis was done to determine dependence of information security awareness rate on computer literacy rate and the education field of students. We conclude that although information technology is of wide usage, the information security topics need to be taught to prevent them from becoming victims of cybercrime.","authors":["Rita Ismailova","Gulshat Muhametjanova"],"meta":["January 2016Information Security Journal A Global Perspective 25(1-3)","DOI:10.1080/19393555.2015.1132800"],"references":["287341727_Information_security_awareness_amongst_academic_librarians","281638930_Human_Performance_Factors_in_Cyber_Security_Forensic_Analysis","279978703_Conceptual_foundation_for_organizational_information_security_awareness","264043557_A_Study_on_Level_of_Knowledge_Regarding_Cybercrime_Among_Elderly_Residing_in_Homes_and_Old_Age_HOMES","261000508_KNOWLEDGE_OF_CYBERCRIME_AMONG_ELDERLY_ACROSS_GENDER","284142326_Web_site_accessibility_usability_and_security_a_survey_of_government_web_sites_in_Kyrgyz_Republic","279249983_Improving_Cyber_Security_Awareness_and_Training_Programs_with_Data_Analytics","277641690_A_Qualitative_Analysis_for_Evaluating_a_Cyber_Terrorism_Framework_in_Malaysia","266643086_Information_Security_Awareness_An_Application_of_Psychological_Factors","248985776_Subcultural_Evolution_Examining_the_Influence_of_On-_and_Off-Line_Experiences_on_Deviant_Subcultures"]}
