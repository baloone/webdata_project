{"id":"266913337_General_Position_Subsets_and_Independent_Hyperplanes_in_d-Space","abstract":"Erdős asked what is the maximum number \\({\\alpha(n)}\\) such that every set of \\({n}\\) points in the plane with no four on a line contains \\({\\alpha(n)}\\) points in general position. We consider variants of this question for \\({d}\\)-dimensional point sets and generalize previously known bounds. In particular, we prove the following two results for fixed \\({d}\\):\nEvery set \\({\\mathcal{H}}\\) of \\({n}\\) hyperplanes in \\({\\mathbb{R}^d}\\) contains a subset \\({S\\subseteq \\mathcal{H}}\\) of size at least \\({c \\left(n\n\\log n\\right)^{1/d}}\\), for some constant \\({c=c(d)> 0}\\), such that no cell of the arrangement of \\({\\mathcal{H}}\\) is bounded by hyperplanes of \\({S}\\) only.\nEvery set of \\({cq^d\\log q}\\) points in \\({\\mathbb{R}^d}\\), for some constant \\({c=c(d)> 0}\\), contains a subset of \\({q}\\) cohyperplanar points or \\({q}\\) points in general position.\nTwo-dimensional versions of the above results were respectively proved by Ackerman et al. [Electronic J. Combinatorics, 2014] and by Payne and Wood [SIAM J. Discrete Math., 2013].","authors":["Jean Cardinal","Csaba D. Tóth","David R.
