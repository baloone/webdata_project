{"id":"344961587_An_image_encryption_algorithm_based_on_chaotic_system_and_compressive_sensing","abstract":"In this paper, we propose an image encryption algorithm based on the memristive chaotic system, elementary cellular automata (ECA) and compressive sensing (CS). Firstly, the original image is transformed by discrete wavelet transform, and the sparse coefficient matrix is obtained. Next, a zigzag scrambling method and the ECA are adopted to scramble the sparse coefficient matrix successively, and this process may effectively improve the scrambling degree. And then, the measurement matrix produced by the memristive chaotic system is used to compress and perceive the scrambled image, and the final cipher image is obtained. In addition, SHA-512 hash function value of the original image is generated to calculate the parameters for zigzag confusion, the initial values of the chaotic system and the initial configurations of the ECA, which enhances the correlation between the algorithm and the plain image and makes the proposed encryption scheme resist the known-plaintext and chosen-plaintext attacks. Moreover, our algorithm can compress and encrypt the image simultaneously by use of CS, which may reduce the amount of data and storage space. Simulation results and performance analyses demonstrate the security and robustness of the proposed scheme.","authors":["Xiuli Chai","Xiaoyu Zheng","Zhihua Gan","Daojun Han"],"meta":["July 2018Signal
