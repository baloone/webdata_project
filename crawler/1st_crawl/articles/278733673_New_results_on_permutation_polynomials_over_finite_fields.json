{"id":"278733673_New_results_on_permutation_polynomials_over_finite_fields","abstract":"Permutation polynomials over finite fields constitute an active research area\nand have applications in many areas of science and engineering. In this paper,\nfour classes of monomial complete permutation polynomials and one class of\ntrinomial complete permutation polynomials are presented, one of which confirms\na conjecture proposed by Wu et al. (Sci. China Math., to appear. Doi:\n10.1007/s11425-014-4964-2). Furthermore, we give two classes of trinomial\npermutation polynomials, and make some progress on a conjecture about the\ndifferential uniformity of power permutation polynomials proposed by Blondeau\net al. (Int. J. Inf. Coding Theory, 2010, 1, pp. 149-170).","authors":["Ma Jingxue","Tao Zhang","Tao Feng","Gennian Ge"],"meta":["May 2017Designs Codes and Cryptography 83(2)","DOI:10.1007/s10623-016-0236-1","SourcearXiv"],"references":["273388726_Some_classes_of_complete_permutation_polynomials_over_Fq","260938555_Permutation_polynomials_induced_from_permutations_of_subfields_and_some_complete_sets_of_mutually_orthogonal_latin_squares","260340673_Permutation_Trinomials_Over_Finite_Fields_with_Even_Characteristic","257682469_Explicit_classes_of_permutation_polynomials_of_F3_3m","278113010_Constructing_Differentially_4-Uniform_Permutations_Over_F-22k_via_the_Switching_Method","268822559_Permutation_polynomials_over_finite_fields_-_A_survey_of_recent_advances","260606430_Some_classes_of_monomial_complete_permutation_polynomials_over_finite_fields_of_characteristic_two","259142817_Several_classes_of_complete_permutation_polynomials","257481951_Further_results_on_a_class_of_permutation_polynomials_over_finite_fields","257481936_A_piecewise_construction_of_permutation_polynomials_over_finite_fields"]}
