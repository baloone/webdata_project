{"id":"277287914_SWI-Prolog_29_-_Reference_Manual","abstract":"Machine [Warren, 1983]). SWI-Prolog has been designed and implemented such that it can easily be modified for experiments with logic programming and the relation between logic programming and other programming paradigms (such as the object oriented XPCE environment [Anjewierden & Wielemaker, 1989]). SWI-Prolog has a rich set of built-in predicates and reasonable performance, which makes it possible to develop substantial applications in it. The current version offers a module system, garbage collection and an interface to the C language. This document gives an overview of the features, system limits and built-in predicates.
