{"id":"311160268_Modified_Flipped_Classroom_Instructional_Model_in_Learning_Sciences_Course_for_Graduate_Students","abstract":"Using the method of design-based research, this study examines the three-year application of the modified flipped classroom model in a postgraduate course on learning sciences. In the modified flipped classroom, students form learning communities in groups. Before class, they read literature, raise questions, and discuss material both online and offline; in class, in an innovative modification to the traditional flipped classroom, students in the teaching group deliver content to their classmates and organize classroom activities; and after class, students conduct empirical research and complete research reports in groups. Through qualitative and quantitative analysis, it is found that the modified flipped classroom can effectively bring out students’ initiative and improve both their learning satisfaction and empirical research abilities. Group-based lesson design and empirical research are found to be the most rewarding activities for students. Finally, recommendations for the application of the modified flipped classroom to postgraduate teaching in the areas of learning platform, course content, teaching methods, and teacher–student interaction are proposed.","authors":["Feng-Kuang Chiang","Chen Chen"],"meta":["November 2016The Asia-Pacific Education Researcher 26(1)","DOI:10.1007/s40299-016-0321-2"],"references":["298332197_Beyond_The_Flipped_Classroom_Redesigning_A_Research_Methods_Course_For_e3_Instruction","269416307_The_Flipped_Classroom_A_Modality_for_Mixed_Asynchronous_and_Synchronous_Learning_in_a_Residency_Program","262017389_The_Experience_of_Three_Flipped_Classrooms_in_an_Urban_University_An_Exploration_of_Design_Principles","260712268_Comparing_the_Effectiveness_of_an_Inverted_Classroom_to_a_Traditional_Classroom_in_an_Upper-Division_Engineering_Course","259110284_Flipped_classroom_model_improves_graduate_student_performance_in_cardiovascular_respiratory_and_renal_physiology","257682714_Flipping_the_classroom_and_instructional_technology_integration_in_a_college-level_information_systems_spreadsheet_course","256703922_Flipping_the_Classroom_to_Improve_Student_Performance_and_Satisfaction","244457271_Design_Experiments_in_Educational_Research","235786490_Redesign_of_a_Large_Lecture_Course_Into_a_Small-Group_Learning_Course","319393897_Taxonomy_of_educational_objectives_The_classification_of_educational_goals_Handbook_I_cognitive_domain","306202417_Instructional_design_and_assessment_Pharmacy_student_engagement_performance_and_perception_in_a_flipped_satellite_classroom","299351172_Design-based_research_A_methodological_toolkit_for_engineering_change","285521835_Flipping_the_Classroom_Applications_to_Curriculum_Redesign_for_an_Introduction_to_Management_Course_Impact_on_Grades","274434507_The_Flipped_Class_A_Method_to_Address_the_Challenges_of_an_Undergraduate_Statistics_Course","272753099_The_use_of_flipped_classrooms_in_higher_education_A_scoping_review","271429289_Design_Research_Theoretical_and_Methodological_Issues","270316939_Making_'The_Flip'_Work_Barriers_to_and_Implementation_Strategies_for_Introducing_Flipped_Teaching_Methods_into_Traditional_Higher_Education_Courses","269417989_Flipping_the_classroom_for_English_language_learners_to_foster_active_learning","266253006_Enhancing_Student_Engagement_Using_the_Flipped_Classroom","265092033_Toward_a_Design_Science_of_Education","258703154_Pharmacy_Student_Engagement_Performance_and_Perception_in_a_Flipped_Satellite_Classroom","247699111_Taxonomy_of_Educational_Objectives_The_Classification_of_Educational_Objectives","243766638_Toward_a_Design_Science_of_Education","237147691_FUTURE_New_Strategies_for_Hospitalists_to_Overcome_Challenges_in_Teaching_on_Today's_Wards","220041931_Design_research_Theoretical_and_methodological_issues","201381680_Taxonomy_of_Educational_Objectives"]}
