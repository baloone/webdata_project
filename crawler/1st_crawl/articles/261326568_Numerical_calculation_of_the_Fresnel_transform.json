{"id":"261326568_Numerical_calculation_of_the_Fresnel_transform","abstract":"In this paper, we address the problem of calculating Fresnel diffraction integrals using a finite number of uniformly spaced samples. General and simple sampling rules of thumb are derived that allow the user to calculate the distribution for any propagation distance. It is shown how these rules can be extended to fast-Fourier-transform-based algorithms to increase calculation efficiency. A comparison with other theoretical approaches is made.","authors":["Damien p Kelly"],"meta":["April 2014Journal of the Optical Society of America A 31(4):755-64","DOI:10.1364/JOSAA.31.000755","SourcePubMed"],"references":["258688025_Holographic_measurement_of_thermal_distortion_during_laser_spot_welding","249334496_Some_considerations_when_numerically_calculating_diffraction_patterns","259253424_Discretization_of_continuous_convolution_operators_for_accurate_modeling_of_wave_propagation_in_digital_holography","253258209_Validity_of_the_Fresnel_approximation_in_the_near_field","252328352_Diffraction_Effects_in_Michelson_Stellar_Interferometry","250090070_Analysis_of_practical_sampling_and_reconstruction_from_Fresnel_fields","249968976_Space-bandwidth_product_adaptation_and_its_application_to_superresolution_Fundamentals","248713565_The_Fourier_Transform_And_Its_Applications","247217546_Space-bandwidth_product_adaptation_and_its_application_to_superresolution_Examples","243772443_Deterministic_phase_retrieval-a_green-function_solution_J_Opt_Soc_Am"]}
