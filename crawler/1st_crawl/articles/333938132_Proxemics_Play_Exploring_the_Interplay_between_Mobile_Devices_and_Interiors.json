{"id":"333938132_Proxemics_Play_Exploring_the_Interplay_between_Mobile_Devices_and_Interiors","abstract":"Proxemics Play has been suggested as a concept for designing socially engaging play experiences. We expand on this concept by investigating the role of fixed and semi-fixed architectural features in configuring meaningful socio-spatial relations of collocated play. We draw on ideas of perceptual, control and deixis proxemics to design and evaluate three cross-device games, illustrating novel directions for proxemics play. The games also illustrate new ways for mobile devices to support physical activity as well as face-to-face social interaction between children.","authors":["Jens Emil Grønbæk","Christine Linding","Anders Kromann","Thomas Fly Hylddal Jensen"],"meta":["June 2019","DOI:10.1145/3301019.3323886","Conference: Companion Publication of the 2019","Project: Flexible Cross-Device Interaction"],"references":["328543812_MeteorQuest_-_Bringing_Families_Together_Through_Proxemics_Play_In_A_Mobile_Social_Game","324663403_Pac-Many_Movement_Behavior_when_Playing_Collaborative_and_Competitive_Games_on_Large_Displays","320313203_GlowPhones_Designing_for_Proxemics_Play_with_Low-Resolution_Displays_in_Location-based_Games","316706103_Sensitizing_Concepts_for_Socio-spatial_Literacy_in_HCI","266658316_Proxemics_play_Understanding_proxemics_for_designing_digital_play_experiences","239761322_Interaction_Proxemics_and_Image_Use_in_Neurosurgery","221247982_Collective_interaction_by_design_collective_controllers_for_social_navigation_on_digital_photos","220383239_Proxemic_interactions_The_new_ubicomp","304916290_Connecting_through_play","235361607_The_Hidden_Dimension"]}
