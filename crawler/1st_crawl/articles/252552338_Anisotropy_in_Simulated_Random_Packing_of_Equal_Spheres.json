{"id":"252552338_Anisotropy_in_Simulated_Random_Packing_of_Equal_Spheres","abstract":"WE have used an IBM 1130 computer to simulate the very slow settling of rigid equal spheres from a dilute slurry into a randomly packed bed. Settling took place in a box defined by {x,y,z0≤x≤20, 0≤y≤20, z≥0}, where the dimensions are given in sphere radii. Initial x and y coordinates of the spheres were chosen by pseudorandom numbers. Once an incoming sphere made its first contact, the process was completely deterministic: the sphere rolled and sometimes fell until it reached a stable position. Thus some spheres rolled all the way from a peak to a valley. Gross wall and end effects were avoided by varying, by means of pseudo-random numbers, the position of walls and floor for each sphere. The final packed bed consisted of 1,561 spheres, but measurements were made on interior spheres only.","authors":["E.M. Tory","Norman A. Cochrane","S. R.
