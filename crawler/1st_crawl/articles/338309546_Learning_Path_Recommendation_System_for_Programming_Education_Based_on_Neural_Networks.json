{"id":"338309546_Learning_Path_Recommendation_System_for_Programming_Education_Based_on_Neural_Networks","abstract":"Programming education has recently received increased attention due to growing demand for programming and information technology skills. However, a lack of teaching materials and human resources presents a major challenge to meeting this demand. One way to compensate for a shortage of trained teachers is to use machine learning techniques to assist learners. This article proposes a learning path recommendation system that applies a recurrent neural network to a learner's ability chart, which displays the learner's scores. In brief, a learning path is constructed from a learner's submission history using a trial-and-error process, and the learner's ability chart is used as an indicator of their current knowledge. An approach for constructing a learning path recommendation system using ability charts and its implementation based on a sequential prediction model and a recurrent neural network, are presented. Experimental evaluation is conducted with data from an e-learning system.","authors":["Tomohiro Saito","Yutaka Watanobe"],"meta":["January 2020International Journal of Distance Education Technologies 18(1):36-64","DOI:10.4018/IJDET.2020010103"],"references":["324210179_A_Recommender_System_for_Programming_Online_Judges_Using_Fuzzy_Information_Modeling","320797002_E-Learning_Recommendation_Framework_Based_on_Deep_Learning","318671349_Deep_Learning_Based_Recommender_System_A_Survey_and_New_Perspectives","284579100_Session-based_Recommendations_with_Recurrent_Neural_Networks","262877889_Learning_Phrase_Representations_using_RNN_Encoder-Decoder_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation","261366296_E-Learning_and_Personalized_Learning_Path_A_Proposal_Based_on_the_Adaptive_Educational_Hypermedia_System","261048573_A_new_approach_in_e-learners_grouping_using_Hybrid_Clustering_Method","228655971_Methods_and_tools_for_exploring_novice_compilation_behaviour","222451107_Rousseeuw_PJ_Silhouettes_A_Graphical_Aid_to_the_Interpretation_and_Validation_of_Cluster_Analysis_Comput_Appl_Math_20_53-65","221140928_Personalized_recommendation_in_social_tagging_systems_using_hierarchical_clustering","220590581_On_the_Development_of_a_Programming_Teaching_Tool_The_Effect_of_Teaching_by_Templates_on_the_Learning_Process","34479898_Understanding_and_improving_automated_collaborative_filtering_systems","2824548_Application_of_Dimensionality_Reduction_in_Recommender_System_--_A_Case_Study","2620988_E-Commerce_Recommendation_Applications","2434797_Analysis_of_Recommendation_Algorithms_for_E-Commerce","2397088_Horting_Hatches_an_Egg_A_New_Graph-Theoretic_Approach_to_Collaborative_Filtering","329956000_A_Method_of_Automatically_Identifying_Learners'_Help-Seeking_Behavior_Classifications_in_Online_Learning_Environment","329023483_Cluster_Analysis_to_Estimate_the_Difficulty_of_Programming_Problems","328927246_Classification_of_Online_Judge_Programmers_based_on_Rule_Extraction_from_Self_Organizing_Feature_Map","327706491_Educational_Data_Mining_to_Improve_Learner_Performance_in_Gauteng_Primary_Schools","323621832_Automatically_Learning_Topics_and_Difficulty_Levels_of_Problems_in_Online_Judge_Systems","320464405_A_Survey_on_Online_Judge_Systems_and_Their_Applications","315911437_A_Personalized_e-Learning_Framework","307438669_Distributed_processing_using_cosine_similarity_for_mapping_Big_Data_in_Hadoop","305649191_Active_internet_technologies_implementation_in_the_students_learning_process_support_system","274903035_Recommender_System_Application_Developments_A_Survey","251979389_The_Research_of_the_Grouping_Algorithm_for_Chinese_Learners_Based_on_Transitive_Closure","228743668_Similarity_measures_for_text_document_clustering","224717749_An_Improvement_of_Matrix-based_Clustering_Method_for_Grouping_Learners_in_E-Learning","224673915_A_Method_for_Learner_Grouping_Based_on_Personality_Clustering","222683642_Personalized_E-Learning_System_Using_Item_Response_Theory","221195712_E-learning_Recommendation_System","220899386_Assessing_Method_for_E-Learner_Clustering","220141058_E-Learning_personalization_based_on_hybrid_recommendation_strategy_and_learning_style_identification","200465318_can_E-learning_Replace_Classroom_Learning","4772044_Estimating_the_Number_of_Clusters_in_a_Data_Set_Via_the_Gap_Statistic","4175099_Grouping_users'_communities_in_an_interactive_Web-based_learning_system_a_data_mining_approach","4012524_An_implementation_of_a_knowledge_recommendation_system_based_on_similarity_among_users'_profiles","3419552_Linden_G_Smith_B_and_York_J_'Amazoncom_recommendations_item-to-item_collaborative_filtering'_Internet_Comput_IEEE_7"]}
