{"id":"5621987_Impact_of_item-writing_flaws_in_multiple-choice_questions_on_student_achievement_in_high-stakes_nursing_assessments","abstract":"Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) are frequently used to assess students in health science disciplines. However, few educators have formal instruction in writing MCQs and MCQ items often have item-writing flaws. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of item-writing flaws on student achievement in high-stakes assessments in a nursing programme in an English-language university in Hong Kong.\nFrom a larger sample, we selected 10 summative test papers that were administered to undergraduate nursing students in 1 nursing department. All test items were reviewed for item-writing flaws by a 4-person consensus panel. Items were classified as 'flawed' if they contained > or = 1 flaw. Items not containing item-writing violations were classified as 'standard'. For each paper, 2 separate scales were computed: a total scale which reflected the characteristics of the assessment as administered and a standard scale which reflected the characteristics of a hypothetical assessment including only unflawed items.\nThe proportion of flawed items on the 10 test papers ranged from 28-75%; 47.3% of all items were flawed. Fewer examinees passed the standard scale than the total scale (748 [90.6%] versus 779 [94.3%]). Conversely, the proportion of examinees obtaining a score > or = 80% was higher on the standard scale than the total scale (173 [20.9%] versus 120 [14.5%]).\nFlawed MCQ items were common in high-stakes nursing assessments but did not disadvantage borderline students, as has been previously demonstrated. Conversely, high-achieving students were more likely than borderline students to be penalised by flawed items.","authors":["Marie Tarrant","James Ware"],"meta":["March 2008Medical Education 42(2):198-206","DOI:10.1111/j.1365-2923.2007.02957.x","SourcePubMed"],"references":["242759434_Constructing_Written_Test_Questions_For_the_Basic_and_Clinical_Sciences","7970399_Improving_the_fairness_of_multiple-choice_questions_A_literature_review","321596183_Constructing_Test_Items_Multiple-Choice_Constructed-Response_Performance_and_Other_Formats","279409160_Assessment_of_Knowledge_with_Written_Test_Forms","259194768_The_frequency_of_item_writing_flaws_in_multiple-choice_questions_used_in_high_stakes_nursing_assessments","256294412_Stata_Statistical_Software_Release_MP_101","249628945_Evaluation_of_Negation_in_Stems_of_Multiple-Choice_Items","248940676_Validity_of_a_Taxonomy_of_Multiple-Choice_Item-Writing_Rules","248940578_A_Review_of_Multiple-Choice_Item-Writing_Guidelines_for_Classroom_Assessment","247524039_Quality_Multiple-Choice_Test_Questions_Item-Writing_Guidelines_and_an_Analysis_of_Auditing_Testbanks","242637755_Developing_and_Validating_Multiple-Choice_Test_Items","234760190_Positive_and_Negative_Multiple_Choice_Items_How_Different_Are_They","233316247_A_Taxonomy_of_Multiple-Choice_Item-Writing_Rules","232958701_The_None-of-the-Above_Option_An_Empirical_Study","229555113_Type_K_and_Other_Complex_Multiple-Choice_Items_An_Analysis_of_Research_and_Item_Properties","23553868_The_frequency_of_item_writing_flaws_in_multiple-choice_questions_used_in_high_stakes_nursing_assessments","21526065_Multiple-choice_testing_in_anatomy","15500680_The_use_of_multiple-choice_tests_in_anatomy_Common_pitfalls_and_how_to_avoid_them","13115456_Cuing_Effect_of_All_of_the_above_on_the_Reliability_and_Validity_of_Multiple-Choice_Test_Items","12132082_Assessment_of_Multiple-Choice_Questions_in_Selected_Test_Banks_Accompanying_Text_Books_Used_in_Nursing_Education","12132081_Writing_Multiple-Choice_Test_Items_That_Promote_and_Measure_Critical_Thinking","11519053_The_Quality_of_In-house_Medical_School_Examinations","11103625_Assessing_Health_Professionals","11081947_Construct-irrelevant_variance_and_flawed_test_questions_Do_multiple-choice_item-writing_principles_make_any_difference","10966546_Threats_to_the_Validity_of_Locally_Developed_Multiple-Choice_Tests_in_Medical_Education_Construct-Irrelevant_Variance_and_Construct_Underrepresentation","8383850_Reliability_On_the_reproducibility_of_assessment_data","8383845_Different_written_assessment_methods_What_can_be_said_about_their_strengths_and_weakness","7681829_The_Effects_of_Violating_Standard_Item_Writing_Principles_on_Tests_and_Students_The_Consequences_of_Using_Flawed_Test_Items_on_Achievement_Examinations_in_Medical_Education"]}
