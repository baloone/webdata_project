{"id":"225264214_Optimal_Algorithms_for_k-Search_with_Application_in_Option_Pricing","abstract":"In the k-search problem, a player is searching for the k highest (respectively, lowest) prices in a sequence, which is revealed to her sequentially. At each quotation, the player\nhas to decide immediately whether to accept the price or not. Using the competitive ratio as a performance measure, we give optimal deterministic and\nrandomized algorithms for both the maximization and minimization problems, and discover that the problems behave substantially\ndifferent in the worst-case. As an application of our results, we use these algorithms to price “lookback options”, a particular\nclass of financial derivatives. We derive bounds for the price of these securities under a no-arbitrage assumption, and compare\nthis to classical option pricing.","authors":["Julian Lorenz","Konstantinos Panagiotou","Angelika Steger"],"meta":["October 2009Algorithmica 55(2):311-328","DOI:10.1007/s00453-008-9217-8","Sourcedx.doi.org"],"references":["313727065_Empirical_properties_of_asset_returns_Stylized_facts_and_statistical_issues","234784007_Amortized_efficiency_of_list_update_paging_rules","265718180_Options_Futures_and_Other_Derivatives","263792244_A_New_Model_for_Interest_Rates","247078069_Options_Futures_and_Other_Derivative_Securities","246187072_Financial_modelling_with_jump_processes_Chapman_HallCRC","243780797_Options_Futures_and_Other_Derivatives","238472471_Chapter_6_The_economics_of_uncertainty_Selected_topics_and_probabilistic_methods","235622487_Stochastic_Calculus_Models_for_Finance_II_Continuous_Time_Models","232650238_Improved_algorithms_and_analysis_for_secretary_problems_and_generalizations"]}
