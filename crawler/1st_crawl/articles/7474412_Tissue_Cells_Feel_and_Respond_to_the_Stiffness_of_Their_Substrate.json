{"id":"7474412_Tissue_Cells_Feel_and_Respond_to_the_Stiffness_of_Their_Substrate","abstract":"Normal tissue cells are generally not viable when suspended in a fluid and are therefore said to be anchorage dependent. Such\ncells must adhere to a solid, but a solid can be as rigid as glass or softer than a baby's skin. The behavior of some cells\non soft materials is characteristic of important phenotypes; for example, cell growth on soft agar gels is used to identify\ncancer cells. However, an understanding of how tissue cells—including fibroblasts, myocytes, neurons, and other cell types—sense\nmatrix stiffness is just emerging with quantitative studies of cells adhering to gels (or to other cells) with which elasticity\ncan be tuned to approximate that of tissues. Key roles in molecular pathways are played by adhesion complexes and the actinmyosin\ncytoskeleton, whose contractile forces are transmitted through transcellular structures. The feedback of local matrix stiffness\non cell state likely has important implications for development, differentiation, disease, and regeneration.","authors":["Dennis Discher","Paul Janmey","Yu-Li Wang"],"meta":["December 2005Science 310(5751):1139-43","DOI:10.1126/science.1116995","SourcePubMed"],"references":["277505320_Mechanics_of_cell_spreading_role_of_myosin_II","229076487_Force_and_focal_adhesion_assembly_a_close_relationship_studied_using_elastic_micro-patterned_substrates","277427132_In_vitro_tubulogenesis_of_endothelial_cells_by_relaxation_of_the_coupling_extracellular_matrix-cytoskeleton","274414893_Separation_of_Propulsive_and_Adhesive_Traction_Stresses_in_Locomoting_Keratocytes","274411871_Synchrony_of_cell_spreading_and_contraction_force_as_phagocytes_engulf_large_pathogens","242515324_A_First_Course_in_Continuum_Mechanics","237685421_Smooth_Muscle_Cells","228007710_Photopolymerization_in_Microfluidic_Gradient_Generators_Microscale_Control_of_Substrate_Compliance_to_Manipulate_Cell_Response","224026222_In_vivo_breast_tumor_detection_using_transient_elastography","222538885_Surface_probe_measurements_of_the_elasticity_of_sectioned_tissue_thin_gels_and_polyelectrolyte_multilayer_films_Correlations_between_substrate_stiffness_and_cell_adhesion"]}
