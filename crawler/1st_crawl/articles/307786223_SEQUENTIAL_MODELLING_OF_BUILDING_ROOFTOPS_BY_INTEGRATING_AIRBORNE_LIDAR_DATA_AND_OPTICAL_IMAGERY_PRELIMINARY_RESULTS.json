{"id":"307786223_SEQUENTIAL_MODELLING_OF_BUILDING_ROOFTOPS_BY_INTEGRATING_AIRBORNE_LIDAR_DATA_AND_OPTICAL_IMAGERY_PRELIMINARY_RESULTS","abstract":"This paper presents a sequential rooftop modelling method to refine initial rooftop models derived from airborne LiDAR data by integrating it with linear cues retrieved from single imagery. A cue integration between two datasets is facilitated by creating new topological features connecting between the initial model and image lines, with which new model hypotheses (variances to the initial model) are produced. We adopt Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle for competing the model candidates and selecting the optimal model by considering the balanced trade-off between the model closeness and the model complexity. Our preliminary results, combined with the Vaihingen data provided by ISPRS WGIII/4 demonstrate the image-driven modelling cues can compensate the limitations posed by LiDAR data in rooftop modelling.","authors":["Gunho Sohn","Jaewook Jung","Yoonseok Jwa","Costas Armenakis"],"meta":["May 2013","DOI:10.5194/isprsannals-II-3-W1-27-2013"],"references":["275579469_Generation_of_Complex_Polyhedral_Building_Models_by_Integrating_Stereo-Aerial_Imagery_and_Lidar_Data","266588650_The_ISPRS_benchmark_on_urban_object_classification_and_3D_building_reconstruction","228630800_Building_reconstruction_from_LIDAR_data_and_aerial_imagery","268733176_MATLAB_and_Octave_Functions_for_Computer_Vision_and_Image_Processing","259649622_Using_a_Binary_Space_Partitioning_Tree_for_Reconstruction_Polyhedral_Building_Models_from_Airbome_Lidar_Data","257601749_A_distributed_multi-model-based_Management_Information_System_for_simulation_and_decision-making_on_construction_projects","254930028_Building_roof_reconstruction_from_LiDAR_data_and_aerial_images_through_plane_extraction_and_colour_edge_detection","228675358_Automated_derivation_of_urban_building_density_information_using_airborne_LIDAR_data_and_object-based_method","223787814_Data_fusion_of_high-resolution_satellite_imagery_and_LiDAR_data_for_automatic_building_extraction","223666575_Towards_automatic_building_extraction_from_high-resolution_digital_elevation_models"]}
