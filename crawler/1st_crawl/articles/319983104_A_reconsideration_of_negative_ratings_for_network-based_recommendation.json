{"id":"319983104_A_reconsideration_of_negative_ratings_for_network-based_recommendation","abstract":"Recommendation algorithms based on bipartite networks have become increasingly popular, thanks to their accuracy and flexibility. Currently, many of these methods ignore usersâ€™ negative ratings. In this work, we propose a method to exploit negative ratings for the network-based inference algorithm. We find that negative ratings play a positive role regardless of sparsity of data sets. Furthermore, we improve the efficiency of our method and compare it with the state-of-the-art algorithms. Experimental results show that the present method outperforms the existing algorithms.","authors":["Liang Hu","Liang Ren","Wenbin Lin"],"meta":["September 2017Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications 490","DOI:10.1016/j.physa.2017.08.119"],"references":["282334490_An_imputation-based_matrix_factorization_method_for_improving_accuracy_of_collaborative_filtering_systems","275366770_Controlled_Expansion_of_Neighborhood_in_Trust_Based_Recommender_Systems","270760601_An_improved_model_of_trust-aware_recommender_systems_using_reliability_measurements","260340752_Information_Filtering_via_Balanced_Diffusion_on_Bipartite_Networks","255972432_Growing_Multiplex_Networks","231081362_Effect_of_initial_configuration_on_network-based_recommendation","221560931_Government-to-Business_Personalized_e-Services_Using_Semantic-Enhanced_Recommender_System","221520131_Exploring_social_influence_via_posterior_effect_of_word-of-mouth_recommendations","221299575_Collaborative_Filtering_via_Gaussian_Probabilistic_Latent_Semantic_Analysis","220800383_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","215470714_Evaluating_collaborative_filtering_recommender_systems","45879135_Adaptive_model_for_recommendation_of_news","45715703_Empirical_analysis_of_web-based_user-object_bipartite_networks","301222357_Toward_the_next_generation_of_recommender_systems_A_survey_of_the_state-of-the-art_and_possible_extensions","295699887_Matrix_factorization_techniques_for_recommender_systems","284218886_Network-based_recommendation_algorithms_A_review","283187458_The_effect_of_heterogeneous_dynamics_of_online_users_on_information_filtering","283097285_Recommender_Systems_for_Social_Networks_Analysis_and_Mining_Precision_Versus_Diversity","277116084_A_reliability-based_recommendation_method_to_improve_trust-aware_recommender_systems","276459128_An_effective_trust-based_recommendation_method_using_a_novel_graph_clustering_algorithm","273291756_Combating_HER2-overexpressing_breast_cancer_through_induction_of_calreticulin_exposure_by_Tras-Permut_CrossMab","272364500_An_Efficient_Approach_to_Generating_Location-Sensitive_Recommendations_in_Ad-hoc_Social_Network_Environments","272101638_NNIA-RS_A_multi-objective_optimization_based_recommender_system","271010640_Connectedness_of_users-items_networks_and_recommender_systems","263202279_Identifying_missing_and_spurious_connections_via_the_bi-directional_diffusion_on_bipartite_networks","262019026_A_pattern_mining_approach_to_enhance_the_accuracy_of_collaborative_filtering_in_sparse_data_domains","260939999_Effect_of_the_social_influence_on_topological_properties_of_user-object_bipartite_networks","251588793_Information_filtering_via_weighted_heat_conduction_algorithm","229324320_Negative_ratings_play_a_positive_role_in_information_filtering","228064326_Predicting_drug-target_interactions_from_chemical_and_genomic_kernels_using_Bayesian_matrix_factorization","221662122_Recommender_Systems","221023652_Google_news_personalization_Scalable_online_collaborative_filtering","51915949_Behavior_patterns_of_online_users_and_the_effect_on_information_filtering","3419552_Linden_G_Smith_B_and_York_J_'Amazoncom_recommendations_item-to-item_collaborative_filtering'_Internet_Comput_IEEE_7"]}
