{"id":"225115254_Permutation_of_transitions_An_event_structure_semantics_for_CCS_and_SCCS","abstract":"We apply Berry & Lvy's notion of equivalence by permutations to CCS and Meije/SCCS, thus obtaining a pomset transition semantics for these calculi. We show that this provides an operational counterpart for an event structure semantics for CCS and SCCS similar to the one given by Winskel.","authors":["GÃ©rard Boudol","Ilaria Castellani"],"meta":["April 2006Lecture Notes in Computer Science 354:411-427","DOI:10.1007/BFb0013028","SourceDBLP","In book: Linear Time, Branching Time and Partial Order in Logics and Models for Concurrency (pp.411-427)"],"references":["223544686_Petri_Nets_Event_Structures_and_Domains_Part_I","220898624_Event_Structure_Semantics_for_CCS_and_Related_Languages","220431629_Minimal_and_Optimal_Computations_of_Recursive_Programs","43611028_Distributed_bisimulations","319541746_Bisimulations_for_concurrency","279047836_INTERNATIONAL_JOINT_CONFERENCE_ON_THEORY_AND_PRACTICE_OF_SOFTWARE-DEVELOPMENT_PISA_MARCH_1987","245624208_CCS-A_Calculus_for_Communicating_Systems","239059787_Concurrent_Program_Schemes_and_their_Interpretations","226465441_On_the_semantics_of_concurrency_Partial_orders_and_transition_systems","225101352_Partial_ordering_derivations_for_CCS","220758727_Petri_Net_Models_for_Algebraic_Theories_of_Concurrency","220247518_Weak_and_strong_fairness_in_CCS","220150753_Calculi_for_Synchrony_and_Asynchrony","213881521_Modeling_concurrency_with_partial_orders","29618825_Communication_is_an_abstraction","29618598_Notes_on_Algebraic_Calculi_of_Processes","29618559_Computational_semantics_of_terms_rewriting_systems"]}
