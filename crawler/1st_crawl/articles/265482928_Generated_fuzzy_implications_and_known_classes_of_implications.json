{"id":"265482928_Generated_fuzzy_implications_and_known_classes_of_implications","abstract":"In MV-logic we use a mapping I : [0, 1] 2 → [0, 1], called a fuzzy implication, which is a monotonous extension of classical implication on the unit interval. In this paper we deal with one of possible extensions of classical implication. Our implications are generated. Some properties of these implications have already been given in [7]. Well-known classes of implications are (S, N)-implications and R-implications. Some connections between class of our generated implications on one side, and (S, N) and R-implications on the other side will be given. The aim of this paper is to study their properties and to investigate connections between mentioned classes.","authors":["Vladislav Biba","Dana Hliň"],"meta":["January 2010"],"references":["292765726_On_many_valued_conjunctions_and_implications","279379348_Fuzzy_Preference_Modelling_and_Multicriteria_Decision_Support","256991794_On_the_characterizations_of_SNSN-implications","241050914_An_Introduction_to_Fuzzy_Implications","226702167_Probabilistic_Metric_Spaces","27413168_On_the_first_place_antitonicity_in_QL-implications","3336537_A_survey_on_fuzzy_implication_functions_IEEE_Trans_Fuzzy_Syst"]}
