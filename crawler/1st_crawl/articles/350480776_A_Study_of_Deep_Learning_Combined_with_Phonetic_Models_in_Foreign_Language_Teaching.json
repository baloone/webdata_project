{"id":"350480776_A_Study_of_Deep_Learning_Combined_with_Phonetic_Models_in_Foreign_Language_Teaching","abstract":"Due to the limitations of English learning environment and teaching conditions in China, English learners in China generally have difficulties in oral English learning.With the development of computer science and technology and the progress of language teaching and learning methods, it is possible to solve this problem.Therefore, this paper applies the mature deep learning technology to English speech recognition and constructs a speech evaluation model.Through experimental research, it is found that the intonation, speech speed and intonation evaluation methods adopted in this paper are highly robust and the English pronunciation quality evaluation model is also feasible. It can effectively promote the development of foreign language teaching in China.","authors":["Fei Wen","Yanfeng Yue"],"meta":["July 2021Wireless Personal Communications 119(03)","DOI:10.1007/s11277-021-08207-7"],"references":["344640808_Sanskrit_to_universal_networking_language_EnConverter_system_based_on_deep_learning_and_context-free_grammar","343497828_Deep_Learning_for_PET_Image_Reconstruction","327017365_Botnet_Detection_in_the_Internet_of_Things_using_Deep_Learning_Approaches","316244391_Automated_analysis_of_high-content_microscopy_data_with_deep_learning","277411157_Deep_Learning","262030045_Deep_Learning_in_Neural_Networks_An_Overview"]}
