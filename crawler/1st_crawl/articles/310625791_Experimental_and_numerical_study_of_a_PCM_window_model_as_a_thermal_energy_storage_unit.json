{"id":"310625791_Experimental_and_numerical_study_of_a_PCM_window_model_as_a_thermal_energy_storage_unit","abstract":"In this article, temperature-responsive window system based on phase change materials is studied by using experimental and numerical methods. The problem is analyzed for the real case (natural environment) and lab environment. Impact of glazing cavity size on the temperature flattening period and its limitations are determined and mathematically described. The results show that the design is effective in reducing interior air temperature variation by increasing the cavity thickness up to 24 mm, which is limited by solid/liquid volume fraction for particular environment.","authors":["Benjamin Durakovic","Muris Torlak"],"meta":["October 2016International Journal of Low-Carbon Technologies 12(3)","DOI:10.1093/ijlct/ctw024"],"references":["301695428_CFD-based_Assessment_of_Thermal_Energy_Storage_in_Phase-Change_Materials_PCM","289999872_Dynamic_Thermal_Performance_of_a_PCM_Window_System_Characterization_Using_Large_Scale_Measurements","276622109_Thermal_energy_storage_The_role_of_the_heat_pipe_in_performance_enhancement","301705629_Thermal_performance_of_a_PCM-filled_double-glazing_unit_with_different_thermophysical_parameters_of_PCM","298423976_Thermal_performance_of_a_PCM-filled_double_glazing_unit_with_different_optical_properties_of_phase_change_material","297659059_Physical-chemical_properties_evolution_and_thermal_properties_reliability_of_a_paraffin_wax_under_solar_radiation_exposure_in_a_real-scale_PCM_window_system","284026149_Experimental_assessment_of_the_thermal_behaviour_of_a_PCM_grazing","282650156_A_numerical_model_to_evaluate_the_thermal_behaviour_of_PCM_glazing_systems","282323021_Literature_review_on_the_use_of_phase_change_materials_in_glazing_and_shading_solutions","277881125_Simulation_study_on_dynamic_heat_transfer_performance_of_PCM-filled_glass_window_with_different_thermophysical_parameters_of_phase_change_material"]}
