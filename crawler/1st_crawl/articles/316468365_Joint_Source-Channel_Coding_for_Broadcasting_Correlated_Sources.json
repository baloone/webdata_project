{"id":"316468365_Joint_Source-Channel_Coding_for_Broadcasting_Correlated_Sources","abstract":"This paper studies lossy transmission of a memoryless bivariate Gaussian source over a bandwidth-mismatched memoryless Gaussian broadcast channel with two receivers, where each receiver is interested in reconstructing only one source component. For both bandwidth expansion and compression regimes, novel hybrid digital/analog (HDA) coding schemes are proposed. With appropriate choice of parameters, our schemes are shown to specialize to separate source-channel coding studied by Gao and Tuncel [9], and is therefore superior to it in both bandwidth regimes. Our scheme for bandwidth expansion also outperforms the HDA coding scheme of Behroozi et al. [4]. On the other hand, if a proposed conjecture (supported by numerical observations) is indeed true, the same superiority follows for the bandwidth compression regime as well. Finally, when the bandwidth expansion/compression ratio approaches 1, both of our schemes become optimal as their performance approaches that of the bandwidth-matched scheme of Tian et al. [15].","authors":["Erman Koken","Ertem Tuncel"],"meta":["April 2017IEEE Transactions on Communications PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2698031"],"references":["224578680_Hybrid_Digital-Analog_Joint_Source-Channel_Coding_for_Broadcasting_Correlated_Gaussian_Sources","224263017_On_the_Performance_of_Hybrid_Digital-Analog_Coding_for_Broadcasting_Correlated_Gaussian_Sources","224174421_Joint_Source_Channel_Coding_With_Side_Information_Using_Hybrid_Digital_Analog_Codes","224145814_Broadcasting_Correlated_Gaussians","224089039_Broadcasting_correlated_Gaussian_sources_with_bandwidth_expansion","3083840_Writing_on_dirty_paper_Corresp","308871453_Matched_multiuser_Gaussian_source-channel_communications_via_uncoded_schemes","304338659_Source-Interference_Recovery_Over_Broadcast_Channels_Asymptotic_Bounds_and_Analog_Codes","273472281_Broadcasting_Correlated_Vector_Gaussians","266908024_Network_Information_Theory","260542615_Separate_Source-Channel_Coding_for_Transmitting_Correlated_Gaussian_Sources_Over_Degraded_Broadcast_Channels","224320009_Duality_between_Broadcasting_with_Bandwidth_Expansion_and_Bandwidth_Compression","224260710_The_Achievable_Distortion_Region_of_Sending_a_Bivariate_Gaussian_Source_on_the_Gaussian_Broadcast_Channel","48196301_Hybrid_Digital-Analog_Codes_for_Source-Channel_Broadcast_of_Gaussian_Sources_Over_Gaussian_Channels","3081942_Broadcast_channels"]}
