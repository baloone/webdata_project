{"id":"267725008_Improving_the_Programming_Experience_of_High_School_Students_by_Means_of_Virtual_Worlds","abstract":"Virtual Worlds have become a very popular kind of software application that has been used in different fields, from games to simulation or education. They allow individuals to interact with others through their avatars and with objects in the environment. Virtual Worlds provide new educational experiences where collaboration and cooperation among users can be easily achieved. This paper presents a novel educational approach based onteacher-student interaction within a virtual environment. This approach has been applied to teaching computer science basics to high-school students. The paper analyses the didactical issues of the created virtual world and the main problems that have been solved in order to develop the operative educational platform. Finally, an evaluation of the covered didactical issues has been carried out. The results of this evaluation show that both teachers and students had a very satisfactory educational experience.","authors":["Mariano Rico","Gonzalo Martínez-Muñoz","Xavier Alaman","David Camacho"],"meta":[],"references":["5842298_Second_Life_An_Overview_of_the_Potential_of_3-D_Virtual_Worlds_in_Medical_and_Health_Education","4339799_Educational_technology_for_collaborative_virtual_environments","295281484_The_fleecing_of_the_avatars","263602566_Effects_of_3D-Simulation-Based_Instruction_on_Students'_Achievement_and_Interests_in_a_Manufacturing_Engineering_Class","262332886_Chaos_and_Graphics_Evaluating_Second_Life_for_the_collaborative_exploration_of_3D_fractals","233658402_M-learning_Enhancement_Using_3D_Worlds","233457319_Using_Virtual_Worlds_in_Education_Second_LifeR_as_an_Educational_Tool","221424631_Supporting_Jigsaw-Based_Collaborative_Learning_in_Second_Life"]}
