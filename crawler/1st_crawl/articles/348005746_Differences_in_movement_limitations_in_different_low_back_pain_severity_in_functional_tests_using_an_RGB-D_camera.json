{"id":"348005746_Differences_in_movement_limitations_in_different_low_back_pain_severity_in_functional_tests_using_an_RGB-D_camera","abstract":"Low back pain (LBP) can lead to motor control disturbance which can be one of the causes of reoccurrence of the complaint. It is important to improve our knowledge of movement related disturbances during assessment in LBP and to classify patients according to the severity. The aim of this study is to present differences in kinematic variables using a RGB-D camera in order to classify LBP patients with different severity. A cross-sectional study was carried out. Subjects with non-specific subacute and chronic LBP were screened 6 weeks following an episode. Functional tests were bending trunk test, sock test and sit to stand test. Participants performed as many repetitions as possible during 30 s for each functional test. Angular displacement, velocity and acceleration, linear acceleration, time and repetitions were analysed. Participants were divided into two groups to determine their different LBP severity with a k-means clusters according to the results obtained in Roland Morris questionnaire (RMQ). Comparing different severity groups based on RMQ score (high impact = 17.15, low impact = 7.47), bending trunk test obtained significative differences in linear acceleration (p = 0.002–0.01). The differences of total linear acceleration during the Sit to Stand test were significative (p = 0.004–0.02). Sock test showed not significative differences between groups (p > 0.05). Linear acceleration variables during Sit to Stand test and Bending trunk test were significatively different between the different severity groups. RGB-D camera system and functional tests can detect kinematic differences in different type of LBP according to the functionality.\nTrial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03293095 “Functional Task
