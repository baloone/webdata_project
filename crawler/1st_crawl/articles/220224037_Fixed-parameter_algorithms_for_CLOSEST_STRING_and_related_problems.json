{"id":"220224037_Fixed-parameter_algorithms_for_CLOSEST_STRING_and_related_problems","abstract":"Closest String is one of the core problems in the field of consen- sus word analysis with particular importance for computational biology. Given k strings of same length and a nonnegative integer d, find a \"clos- est string\" s such that none of the given strings has Hamming distance greater than d from s. Closest String is NP-complete. In biologi- cal applications, however, d usually is very small. We show how to solve Closest String in linear time for constant d—the exponential growth in d is bounded by O(dd). We extend this result to the closely related problems d-Mismatch and Distinguishing String Selection. More- over, we also show that Closest String is solvable in linear time when k is constant and d is arbitrary. In summary, this means that Closest String is fixed-parameter tractable with respect to parameter d and with respect to parameter k. Finally, the practical usefulness of our findings is substantiated by some experimental results. � An extended abstract of this paper was presented at the 12th International Symposium on Algorithms and Computation (ISAAC 2001), Springer-Verlag, LNCS 2223, pages 441-453, held in Christchurch, New Zealand, December 19-21, 2001. † Supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG), project OPAL (optimal so- lutions for hard problems in computational biology), NI 369/2-1.","authors":["Jens Gramm","Rolf Niedermeier","Peter Rossmanith"],"meta":["September 2003Algorithmica 37(1):25-42","DOI:10.1007/s00453-003-1028-3","SourceDBLP"],"references":["230596114_The_Scope_of_Integer_and_Combinatorial_Optimization","220994885_On_the_Parameterized_Intractability_of_Closest_Substring_and_Related_Problems","41035884_The_parameterized_complexity_of_p-center_approximate_substring_problems","12819169_Comparison_of_five_methods_for_finding_conserved_sequences_in_multiple_alignments_of_gene_regulatory_regions","11355574_Algorithms_for_Phylogenetic_Footprinting","2398674_On_The_Closest_String_and_Substring_Problems","2275193_Banishing_Bias_from_Consensus_Sequences","273001922_Theory_of_linear_and_integer_programming","268292063_Computational_Molecular_Biology_An_Algorithmic_Approach","246835147_Minkowski's_Convex_Body_Theorem_and_Integer_Programming","239059554_Faster_exact_solutions_for_hard_problems_a_parameterized_point_of_view","228057867_Theory_of_Linear_and_Integer_Programming","227103434_On_Covering_Problems_of_Codes","222660260_A_general_method_to_speed_up_fixed-parameter-tractable_algorithms","222657536_Distinguishing_String_Selection_Problems","221543429_Parameterized_Complexity_The_Main_Ideas_and_Some_Research_Frontiers","221313766_Banishing_Bias_from_Consensus_Sequences","221220008_A_Linear-Time_Algorithm_for_the_1-Mismatch_Problem","28641207_Integer_Programming_with_a_Fixed_Number_of_Variables","13577244_Practical_Aspects_of_Multiple_Sequence_Alignment","12345339_Combinatorial_Approaches_to_Finding_Subtle_Signals_in_DNA_Sequences","11355575_Finding_Motifs_Using_Random_Projections","7899364_Rapid_Large-Scale_Oligonucleotide_Selection_for_Microarrays","2495568_Closest_Strings_Primer_Design_and_Motif_Search","2494718_Closest_Strings_Primer_Design_and_Motif_Search","2351360_Asymptotic_Enumeration_Methods","2317793_Faster_Exact_Algorithms_for_Hard_Problems_A_Parameterized_Point_of_View"]}
