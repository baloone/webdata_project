{"id":"290182461_Vehicle_routing_problems_with_multiple_trips","abstract":"This paper presents a survey on the multi-trip vehicle routing problem (MTVRP) and on related routing problems where vehicles are allowed to perform multiple trips. The first part of the paper focuses on the MTVRP. It gives an unified view on mathematical formulations and surveys exact and heuristic approaches. The paper continues with variants of the MTVRP and other families of routing problems where multiple trips are sometimes allowed. For the latter, it specially insists on the motivations for having multiple trips and the algorithmic consequences. The expected contribution of the survey is to give a comprehensive overview on a structural property of routing problems that has seen a strongly growing interest in the last few years and that has been investigated in very different areas of the routing literature.","authors":["Diego Cattaruzza","Nabil Absi","Dominique Feillet"],"meta":["September 20164OR 14(3)","DOI:10.1007/s10288-016-0306-2"],"references":["278798156_The_Multi-Trip_Vehicle_Routing_Problem_with_Time_Windows_and_Release_Dates","273682794_A_Large_Neighbourhood_Search_Heuristic_for_a_Periodic_Supply_Vessel_Planning_Problem_Arising_in_Offshore_Oil_and_Gas_Operations","271544656_Evolutionary_algorithm_for_a_Green_vehicle_routing_problem_with_multiple_trips","339310687_A_simple_and_effective_evolutionary_algorithm_for_the_vehicle_routing_problem","292206197_Ship_Routing_Design_for_the_Oily_Liquid_Waste_Collection","287667524_A_branch_and_cut_algorithm_for_the_vehicle_routing_problem_with_multiple_use_of_vehicles","286654677_Solving_strategic_and_tactical_optimization_problems_in_city_logistics","281566032_An_Adaptive_Large_Neighborhood_Search_for_the_Two-Echelon_Multiple-Trip_Vehicle_Routing_Problem_with_Satellite_Synchronization","278658533_Multistart_Evolutionary_Local_Search_for_a_Disaster_Relief_Problem","276915733_The_production_routing_problem_A_review_of_formulations_and_solution_algorithms","271311425_Vehicle_Routing_Problem_with_Backhaul_Multiple_Trips_and_Time_Window","268340339_A_Hybrid_Evolutionary_Approach_for_a_Vehicle_Routing_Problem_with_Double_Time_Windows_for_the_Depot_and_Multiple_Use_of_Vehicles","270903850_Reduction_of_CO2_Emissions_in_Cumulative_Multi-Trip_Vehicle_Routing_Problems_with_Limited_Duration","270854150_A_comprehensive_decision_support_model_for_the_evaluation_of_eco-designs","270396557_Thirty_Years_of_Inventory_Routing"]}
