{"id":"260085455_Continuum_thermodynamics_ASME","abstract":"Some of the most significant research published in the last 15-20 years\nin the field of continuum thermodynamics is reviewed. The construction\nof simple models of rigorous mathematical formulation that still remain\nin close contact with physical reality is stressed throughout. The\n'local accompanying equilibrium state' (l.a.s.) is described and some\nclassical applications are given. Examples related to isothermal solid\nmechanics in the frame of small perturbation theory, including\nviscoplasticity and damge of ductile materials, are given. Global\nvariables are introduced in an example from fracture mechanics.\nHomogenization and thermodynamics are also considered, providing some\ninsight into the consistency of the l.a.s. model and into its physical\ninterpretation.","authors":["Paul Germain","Quoc Son Nguyen","Pierre Suquet"],"meta":["December 1983Journal of Applied Mechanics 105(50):1011-1020","DOI:10.1115/1.3167184"],"references":["331815860_FINITE_DEFORMATION_CONSTITUTIVE_RELATIONS_INCLUDING_DUCTILE_FRACTURE_DAMAGE","243581686_Irreversible_Processes_and_Physical_Interpretation_of_Rational_Thermodynamics","234205355_The_Thermodynamics_of_Fluid_Systems","227278771_On_the_thermodynamics_of_elastic-plastic_materials_with_temperature-dependent_moduli_and_yield_stresses","226639788_The_method_of_virtual_power_in_continuum_mechanics_Application_to_coupled_fields","226277820_The_Second_Law_of_Thermodynamics_for_systems_with_approximate_cycles","226253288_On_the_mathematical_foundations_of_elastic_stability_theory_I"]}
