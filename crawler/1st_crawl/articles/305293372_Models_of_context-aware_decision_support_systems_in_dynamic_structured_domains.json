{"id":"305293372_Models_of_context-aware_decision_support_systems_in_dynamic_structured_domains","abstract":"Some existing approaches to representation and organization of contexts in different information systems are analyzed. A two-level context management model for intelligent decision support in dynamic structured domains is proposed. A model for description of information resources of an open information environment is given. A technology model of context-aware decision support system is designed.","authors":["Alexander V.
