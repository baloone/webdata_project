{"id":"311712471_Trapezoidal_fuzzy_multi-number_and_its_application_to_multi-criteria_decision-making_problems","abstract":"In this paper, the concept of trapezoidal fuzzy multi-number (TFM-number) is proposed and some desired operational laws with properties are introduced. In the TFM-number, the occurrences are more than one with the possibility of the same or the different membership functions and the TFM-number is an extension of both fuzzy number set and fuzzy set, allowing the repeated occurrences of any element. Also, aim of this paper is to investigate a multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) method under TFM-number environment. To construct this method, we first introduce some operational laws on TFM-number based on t-norm and s-norm. Then, TFM-number arithmetic and geometric operators are proposed. Finally, we develop an MCDM method and apply to an MCDM problem to verify the introduced decision-making methods.","authors":["Vakkas Uluçay","Irfan Deli","Memet Şahin"],"meta":["September 2018Neural Computing and Applications 30(5):1469-1478","DOI:10.1007/s00521-016-2760-3"],"references":["283936029_Intuitionistic_hesitant_linguistic_sets_and_their_application_in_multi-criteria_decision-making_problems","283760284_A_Multi-Criteria_Decision-Making_Method_Based_on_Heronian_Mean_Operators_Under_a_Linguistic_Hesitant_Fuzzy_Environment","316693276_Fuzzy_Set_Theory_-_and_Its_Applications","284205346_A_multi-criteria_decision-making_method_based_on_triangular_intuitionistic_fuzzy_preference_information_httpwwwtandfonlinecomeprintvZ5wVDNiSvbuM8uZdsbafull","283801495_The_ordered_weighted_geometric_averaging_algorithm_to_multiple_attribute_decision_making_within_triangular_fuzzy_numbers_based_on_the_mean_area_measurement_method1","282563561_2-Dimensional_Discrete_Fuzzy_Numbers_and_Applications","281137446_Some_interesting_properties_of_the_fuzzy_linguistic_model_based_on_discrete_fuzzy_numbers_to_manage_hesitant_fuzzy_linguistic_information","279518204_Multi-criteria_Group_Decision-Making_Approach_Based_on_2-Tuple_Linguistic_Aggregation_Operators_with_Multi-hesitant_Fuzzy_Linguistic_Information","277351459_On_solving_matrix_games_with_pay-offs_of_triangular_fuzzy_numbers_Certain_observations_and_generalizations","276299620_Existence_uniqueness_calculus_and_properties_of_triangular_approximations_of_fuzzy_numbers_under_a_general_condition","275407561_Ranking_Generalized_Exponential_Trapezoidal_Fuzzy_Numbers_Based_on_Variance","274405446_Possibilistic_Characteristic_Functions","276272577_Linguistic_hesitant_fuzzy_multi-criteria_decision-making_method_based_on_evidential_reasoning_httpwwwtandfonlinecomeprintdK2AzHNz8WVBz8wW7DHIfull","274383617_Multi-objective_Assignment_Problem_with_Generalized_Trapezoidal_Fuzzy_Numbers","273756731_Elementary_Operations_on_L-R_Fuzzy_Number"]}
