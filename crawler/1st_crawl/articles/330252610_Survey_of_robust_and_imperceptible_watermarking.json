{"id":"330252610_Survey_of_robust_and_imperceptible_watermarking","abstract":"Robustness, imperceptibility and embedding capacity are the preliminary requirements of any watermarking technique. However, research concluded that these requirements are difficult to achieve at same time. In this paper, we review various recent robust and imperceptible watermarking methods in spatial and transform domain. Further, the paper introduces elementary concepts of digital watermarking, characteristics and novel applications of watermark in detail. Furthermore, various analysis and comparison of different notable watermarking techniques are discussed in tabular format. We believe that our survey contribution will helpful for fledgling researchers to develop robust and imperceptible watermarking algorithms for various practical applications.","authors":["Namita Agarwal","Amit Kumar Singh","Pradeep Kumar Singh"],"meta":["January 2019Multimedia Tools and Applications 78(3)","DOI:10.1007/s11042-018-7128-5"],"references":["327787169_Chaotic_based_secure_watermarking_approach_for_medical_images","325533328_Improved_wavelet-based_image_watermarking_through_SPIHT","323887896_A_robust_image_watermarking_technique_based_on_DWT_APDCBT_and_SVD","322968351_Secure_and_Robust_Fragile_Watermarking_Scheme_for_Medical_Images","320912719_Combining_Mexican_hat_wavelet_and_spread_spectrum_for_adaptive_watermarking_and_its_statistical_detection_using_medical_images","320003505_A_recent_survey_on_image_watermarking_techniques_and_its_application_in_e-governance","318378388_Robust_image_embedded_watermarking_using_DCT_and_listless_SPIHT","316278800_Medical_Image_Watermarking_techniques_and_Applications","325388568_Guided_dynamic_particle_swarm_optimization_for_optimizing_digital_image_watermarking_in_industry_applications","318327402_An_intelligent_learning-based_watermarking_scheme_for_outsourced_biomedical_time_series_data"]}
