{"id":"337470664_Drug_Hepatotoxicity_Causality_Assessment","abstract":"Drug induced liver injury is a diagnosis that relies on the patterns of injury associated with specific medications and toxins. The process by which a clinician determines which agent is the likely culprit of the liver injury is called causality assessment. The Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method (RUCAM) and additional causality assessment methods have been developed with the goal of providing a more standardized, less subjective approach to causality assessment. RUCAM remains the most used standardized method, however many physicians continue to rely on their experience for causality assessment.","authors":["Allyce Caines","Dilip Moonka"],"meta":["February 2020Clinics in Liver Disease 24(1):25-35","DOI:10.1016/j.cld.2019.09.001"],"references":["316052121_Drug_Induced_Liver_Injury_Can_Biomarkers_Assist_RUCAM_in_Causality_Assessment","315635164_Drug-induced_liver_injury_Recent_advances_in_diagnosis_and_risk_assessment","299547124_The_Honolulu_Liver_Disease_Cluster_at_the_Medical_Center_Its_Mysteries_and_Challenges","293042775_Drug-Induced_Liver_Injury_Network_Causality_Assessment_Criteria_and_Experience_in_the_United_States","274203884_Drug-_and_Herb-Induced_Liver_Injury_in_Clinical_and_Translational_Hepatology_Causality_Assessment_Methods_Quo_Vadis","50195361_Causality_assessment_methods_in_drug_induced_liver_injury_Strengths_and_weaknesses","23573207_Practical_guideline_for_diagnosis_and_early_management_of_drug-induced_liver_injury","323537590_Drug-Induced_Liver_Injury_Why_is_the_Roussel_Uclaf_Causality_Assessment_Method_RUCAM_Still_Used_25_Years_After_Its_Launch","321351656_Agreement_Among_Different_Scales_for_Causality_Assessment_in_Drug-Induced_Liver_Injury","246602910_1137_THE_HLA_CLASS_I_B1801_ALLELE_INFLUENCES_HEPATOCELLULAR_EXPRESSION_OF_AMOXICILLIN-CLAVULANATE_LIVER_DAMAGE_AND_OUTCOME_IN_SPANISH_PATIENTS","44640170_Causality_Assessment_in_Drug-Induced_Liver_Injury_Using_a_Structured_Expert_Opinion_Process_Comparison_to_the_Roussel-Uclaf_Causality_Assessment_Method","26892557_The_Pathology_of_Drug-Induced_Liver_Injury","26819004_Drug-induced_liver_injury_Insights_from_genetic_studies","26246990_Phenotypic_Characterization_of_Idiosyncratic_Drug-Induced_Liver_Injury_The_Influence_of_Age_and_Sex","20243445_Causality_Assessment_of_Suspected_Adverse_Drug_Reactions","15208947_Lymphocyte_reactivity_to_ex-vivo_drug_antigens_in_drug-induced_hepatitis","14970399_Causality_assessment_of_adverse_reactions_to_drugs-II_An_original_model_for_validation_of_drug_causality_assessment_methods_Case_reports_with_positive_rechallenge","14970398_Causality_assessment_of_adverse_reactions_to_drugs-I_A_novel_method_based_on_the_conclusions_of_international_consensus_meetings_Application_to_drug-induced_liver_injuries","13917098_Development_and_validation_of_a_clinical_scale_for_the_diagnosis_of_drug-induced_hepatitis","12203718_Comparison_of_two_clinical_scales_for_causality_assessment_in_hepatoxicity","11354310_Epidemiology_and_Individual_Susceptibility_to_Adverse_Drug_Reactions_Affecting_the_Liver","8138794_Validity_study_of_a_new_diagnostic_scale_for_drug-induced_liver_injury_in_Japan_-_Comparison_with_two_previous_scales","6914705_Can_Decisional_Algorithms_Replace_Global_Introspection_in_the_Individual_Causality_Assessment_of_Spontaneously_Reported_ADRs","6666065_Outcome_of_acute_idiosyncratic_drug-induced_liver_injury_Long-term_follow-up_in_a_hepatotoxicity_registry","5566757_Evaluation_of_the_Naranjo_Adverse_Drug_Reactions_Probability_Scale_in_the_Causality_Assessment_of_Drug-Induced_Liver_Injury"]}
