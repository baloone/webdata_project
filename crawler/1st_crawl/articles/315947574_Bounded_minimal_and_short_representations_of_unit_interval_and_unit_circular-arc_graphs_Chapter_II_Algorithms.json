{"id":"315947574_Bounded_minimal_and_short_representations_of_unit_interval_and_unit_circular-arc_graphs_Chapter_II_Algorithms","abstract":"This is the second and last chapter of a work in which we consider the unrestricted, minimal, and bounded representation problems for unit interval (UIG) and unit circular-arc (UCA) graphs. In the unrestricted version (${\\rm R{\\small EP}}$), a proper circular-arc (PCA) model $\\mathcal M$ is given and the goal is to obtain an equivalent UCA model $\\mathcal U$. In the bounded version (${\\rm B{\\small OUND}R{\\small EP}}$), $\\mathcal M$ is given together with some lower and upper bounds that the beginning points of $\\mathcal U$ must satisfy. In the minimal version (${\\rm M{\\small IN}UCA}$), the circumference of the circle and the length of the arcs in $\\mathcal U$ must be simultaneously as small as possible, while the separation of the extremes is greater than a given threshold. In this chapter we take advantage of the theoretical framework developed in Chapter I to design efficient algorithms for these problems. We show a linear-time algorithm with negative certification for ${\\rm R{\\small EP}}$, that can also be implemented to run in logspace. We develop algorithms for different versions of ${\\rm B{\\small OUND}R{\\small EP}}$ that run in linear space and quadratic time. Regarding ${\\rm M{\\small IN}UCA}$, we first show that the previous linear-time algorithm for ${\\rm M{\\small IN}UIG}$ (i.e., ${\\rm M{\\small IN}UCA}$ on UIG models) fails to provide a minimal model for some input graphs. We fix this algorithm but, unfortunately, it runs in linear space and quadratic time. Then, we apply the algorithms for ${\\rm M{\\small IN}UIG}$ and ${\\rm M{\\small IN}UCA}$ ( Chapter I) to find the minimum powers of paths and cycles that contain given UIG and UCA models, respectively.","authors":["Francisco J.
