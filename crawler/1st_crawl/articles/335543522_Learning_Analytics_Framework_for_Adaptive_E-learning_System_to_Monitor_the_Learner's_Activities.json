{"id":"335543522_Learning_Analytics_Framework_for_Adaptive_E-learning_System_to_Monitor_the_Learner's_Activities","abstract":"The adaptive e-learning system (AE-LS) research has long focused on the learner model and learning activities to personalize the learner’s experience. However, there are many unresolved issues that make it difficult for trainee teachers to obtain appropriate information about the learner's behavior. The evolution of the Learning Analytics (LA) offers new possibilities to solve problems of AE-LS. In this paper, we proposed a Business intelligence framework for AE-LS to monitor and manage the performance of the learner more effectively. The suggested architecture of the ALS proposes a data warehouse model that responds to these problems. It defines specifics measures and dimensions, which helps teachers and educational administrators to evaluate and analyze the learner’s activities. By analyzing these interactions, the adaptive e-learning analytic system (AE-LAS) has the potential to provide a predictive view of upcoming challenges. These predictions are used to evaluate the adaptation of the content presentation and improve the performance of the learning process.","authors":["Salma El Janati","Abdelilah Maach","Driss El Ghanami"],"meta":["September 2019International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications 10(8):275-284","DOI:10.14569/IJACSA.2019.0100835"],"references":["345606589_Adaptive_Hypermedia_Systems","315717307_Learning_Analytics_Explained","314242075_Knowledge-based_Intelligent_Tutoring_System_for_Teaching_Mongo_Database","309619917_Logging_of_fingertip_actions_is_not_enough_for_analysis_of_learning_activities","280841452_Adaptive_Navigation_Support_From_Adaptive_Hypermedia_to_the_Adaptive_Web_and_Beyond","222815211_Educational_data_mining_A_survey_from_1995_to_2005","222020078_CourseVis_A_graphical_student_monitoring_tool_for_supporting_instructors_in_web-based_distance_courses","221424616_MATEP_Monitoring_and_Analysis_Tool_for_E-learning_Platforms","221423240_Monitoring_Virtual_Classroom_Visualization_Techniques_to_Observe_Student_Activities_in_an_e-Learning_System","220500632_Developing_an_Enterprise_Business_Intelligence_Capability_The_Norfolk_Southern_Journey","329654512_Visual_Progression_Analysis_of_Student_Records_Data","326439268_Social_Network_Analysis_and_Learning_Communities_in_Higher_Education_Online_Learning_A_Systematic_Literature_Review_in_press","321598241_Web_Data_Mining_Exploring_Hyperlinks_Contents_and_Usage_Data","320606867_Towards_a_new_adaptive_E-learning_framework_for_adapting_content_to_presentation","317746758_An_exploration_of_online_behaviour_engagement_and_achievement_in_flipped_classroom_supported_by_learning_management_system","316600283_Data_Mining_Concepts_and_Techniques","270276876_Building_the_Data_Warehouse","220689482_Introduction_to_Information_Visualization","4762092_How_Students_Learn_Statistics_Revisited_A_Current_Review_of_Research_on_Teaching_and_Learning_Statistics"]}
