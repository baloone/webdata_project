{"id":"336309113_Multidimensional_Algorithmic_Thinking_Development_on_Mental_Learning_Platform","abstract":"The problem of algorithmic thinking development in computer science, computer technology and information technology courses remains relevant despite a lot of research done in the area. The present article is intended to substantiate the mental learning platform for further use of cognitive methods and training tools; it discloses the essence of multidimensional algorithmic thinking and presents mental and embodied (kinaesthetic) programming training tools. The authors arrive at the conclusion that development of multidimensional algorithmic thinking should be carried out through the use of mental algorithmic maps for different styles of thinking, mental and empirical tasks, as well as kinaesthetic simulators. Such training tools involve all channels of perception and greatly contribute to the understanding and better assimilation of “Algorithmization and programming” subject. The results of the research can be useful for computer science teachers at schools and programming teachers at higher educational institutions","authors":["Nikolay I. Pak","Tatiana A.
