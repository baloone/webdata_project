{"id":"287250022_On_links_of_vertices_in_simplicial_d-complexes_embeddable_in_euclidean_2d-space","abstract":"We consider $d$-dimensional simplicial complexes which can be PL embedded in\nthe $2d$-dimensional euclidean space. In short, we show that in any such\ncomplex, for any three vertices, the intersection of link-complexes of the\nvertices is linklessly embeddable in $(2d-1)$-dimensional euclidean space. From\nthis observation, we derive a new upper bound on the total number of\n$d$-simplices in an embeddable complex in $2d$-space with $n$ vertices,\nimproving known upper bounds. Moreover, the bound is also true for the size of\n$d$-complexes linklessly embeddable in $(2d+1)$-dimensional space.","authors":["Salman Parsa"],"meta":["April 2018Discrete & Computational Geometry 59(8)","DOI:10.1007/s00454-017-9936-1","SourcearXiv"],"references":["243077207_Approximating_Embeddings_of_Polyhedra_In_Codimension_Three","346677504_Design_Theory","307891570_Imbeddings_of_Simplicial_Complexes","304572546_Imbedding_classes_and_n-minimal_complexes","266524355_Imbeddings_of_simplicial_complexes","266009748_Lehrbuch_der_Topologie","260082669_Lectures_on_Polytopes","256743680_Higher-Dimensional_analogs_of_the_four-color_problem_and_some_inequalities_for_simplicial_complexes","248390470_Algebraic_Topology","248284574_Using_the_Borsuk-Ulam_Theorem"]}
