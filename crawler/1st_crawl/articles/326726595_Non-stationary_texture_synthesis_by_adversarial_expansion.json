{"id":"326726595_Non-stationary_texture_synthesis_by_adversarial_expansion","abstract":"The real world exhibits an abundance of non-stationary textures. Examples include textures with large scale structures, as well as spatially variant and inhomogeneous textures. While existing example-based texture synthesis methods can cope well with stationary textures, non-stationary textures still pose a considerable challenge, which remains unresolved. In this paper, we propose a new approach for example-based non-stationary texture synthesis. Our approach uses a generative adversarial network (GAN), trained to double the spatial extent of texture blocks extracted from a specific texture exemplar. Once trained, the fully convolutional generator is able to expand the size of the entire exemplar, as well as of any of its sub-blocks. We demonstrate that this conceptually simple approach is highly effective for capturing large scale structures, as well as other non-stationary attributes of the input exemplar. As a result, it can cope with challenging textures, which, to our knowledge, no other existing method can handle.","authors":["Yang Zhou","Zhen Zhu","Xiang Bai","Dani Lischinski"],"meta":["July 2018ACM Transactions on Graphics 37(4):1-13","DOI:10.1145/3197517.3201285"],"references":["322060135_Unpaired_Image-to-Image_Translation_Using_Cycle-Consistent_Adversarial_Networks","320966887_Image-to-Image_Translation_with_Conditional_Adversarial_Networks","318614442_Deep_correlations_for_texture_synthesis","317010262_Learning_Texture_Manifolds_with_the_Periodic_Spatial_GAN","315710637_Unpaired_Image-to-Image_Translation_using_Cycle-Consistent_Adversarial_Networks","313910272_Synthesising_Dynamic_Textures_using_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","310953155_Texture_Synthesis_with_Spatial_Generative_Adversarial_Networks","310610633_Image-to-Image_Translation_with_Conditional_Adversarial_Networks","301842292_Texture_Networks_Feed-forward_Synthesis_of_Textures_and_Stylized_Images","281312423_A_Neural_Algorithm_of_Artistic_Style","263012109_Generative_Adversarial_Networks","255564224_State_of_the_Art_in_Example-based_Texture_Synthesis","220184529_Graphcut_Textures_Image_and_Video_Synthesis_Using_Graph_Cuts","220183623_Texture_optimization_for_example-based_synthesis","2915262_Near-Regular_Texture_Analysis_and_Manipulation","2406594_Image_Analogies","345708689_Deep_Correlations_for_Texture_Synthesis","320968363_Photo-Realistic_Single_Image_Super-Resolution_Using_a_Generative_Adversarial_Network","317749891_Analysis_and_Controlled_Synthesis_of_Inhomogeneous_Textures","311609041_Deep_Residual_Learning_for_Image_Recognition","308278061_Perceptual_Losses_for_Real-Time_Style_Transfer_and_Super-Resolution","308277264_Precomputed_Real-Time_Texture_Synthesis_with_Markovian_Generative_Adversarial_Networks","301836893_Perceptual_Losses_for_Real-Time_Style_Transfer_and_Super-Resolution","286512696_Deep_Residual_Learning_for_Image_Recognition","280972417_Self_Tuning_Texture_Optimization","275485644_Graphcut_textures","274408565_Layered_shape_synthesis","269935079_Adam_A_Method_for_Stochastic_Optimization","265385906_Very_Deep_Convolutional_Networks_for_Large-Scale_Image_Recognition","254461090_Image_Melding_Combining_Inconsistent_Images_using_Patch-based_Synthesis","220184600_Appearance-space_texture_synthesis","220184481_Synthesis_of_progressively-variant_textures_on_arbitrary_surfaces","220183585_Layered_Shape_Synthesis_Automatic_Generation_of_Control_Maps_for_Non-Stationary_Textures","6576883_Space-Time_Completion_of_Video","3816666_Texture_Synthesis_by_Non-parametric_Sampling","2885243_Image_Quilting_for_Texture_Synthesis_and_Transfer","2641311_Texture_Synthesis_by_Non-parametric_Sampling","2352293_Fast_Texture_Synthesis_Using_Tree-Structured_Vector_Quantization"]}
