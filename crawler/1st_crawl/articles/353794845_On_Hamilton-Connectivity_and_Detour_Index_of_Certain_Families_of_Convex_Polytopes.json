{"id":"353794845_On_Hamilton-Connectivity_and_Detour_Index_of_Certain_Families_of_Convex_Polytopes","abstract":"A convex polytope is the convex hull of a finite set of points in the Euclidean space R n. By preserving the adjacency-incidence relation between vertices of a polytope, its structural graph is constructed. A graph is called Hamilton-connected if there exists at least one Hamiltonian path between any of its two vertices. e detour index is defined to be the sum of the lengths of longest distances, i.e., detours between vertices in a graph. Hamiltonian and Hamilton-connected graphs have diverse applications in computer science and electrical engineering, whereas the detour index has important applications in chemistry. Checking whether a graph is Hamilton-connected and computing the detour index of an arbitrary graph are both NP-complete problems. In this paper, we study these problems simultaneously for certain families of convex polytopes. We construct two infinite families of Hamilton-connected convex polytopes. Hamilton-connectivity is shown by constructing Hamiltonian paths between any pair of vertices. We then use the Hamilton-connectivity to compute the detour index of these families. A family of non-Hamilton-connected convex polytopes has also been constructed to show that not all convex polytope families are Hamilton-connected.","authors":["Sakander Hayat","Muhammad Yasir","Ali Ahmad","Suliman Khan"],"meta":["July 2021Mathematical Problems in Engineering 2021","DOI:10.1155/2021/5553216"],"references":["348776214_Hamilton_Connectivity_of_Convex_Polytopes_with_Applications_to_Their_Detour_Index","338222836_Zagreb_Connection_Indices_of_Subdivision_and_Semi-Total_Point_Operations_on_Graphs","338143501_On_Mixed_Metric_Dimension_of_Rotationally_Symmetric_Graphs","336520564_Minimum_Detour_Index_of_Tricyclic_Graphs","334283046_Edge_restricted_detour_index_of_some_graphs","329479316_Binary_Locating-Dominating_Sets_in_Rotationally-Symmetric_Convex_Polytopes","327054293_The_binary_locating-dominating_number_of_some_convex_polytopes","325487270_The_Open-Locating-Dominating_Number_of_Some_Convex_Polytopes","309895790_Sufficient_conditions_for_Hamiltonicity_in_multiswapped_networks","326929185_On_the_fault-tolerant_metric_dimension_of_convex_polytopes","299609975_On_the_metric_dimension_of_rotationally-symmetric_convex_polytopes","299547994_Computing_the_metric_dimension_of_convex_polytopes_generated_by_wheel_related_graphs","282724314_The_detour_matrix_in_chemistry","276422416_On_the_metric_dimension_of_two_families_of_convex_polytopes","285530222_The_Detour_Index"]}
