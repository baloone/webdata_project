{"id":"221016026_Activity_Recognition_from_User-Annotated_Acceleration_Data","abstract":"In this work, algorithms are developed and evaluated to de- tect physical activities from data acquired using five small biaxial ac- celerometers worn simultaneously on different parts of the body. Ac- celeration data was collected from 20 subjects without researcher su- pervision or observation. Subjects were asked to perform a sequence of everyday tasks but not told specifically where or how to do them. Mean, energy, frequency-domain entropy, and correlation of acceleration data was calculated and several classifiers using these features were tested. De- cision tree classifiers showed the best performance recognizing everyday activities with an overall accuracy rate of 84%. The results show that although some activities are recognized well with subject-independent training data, others appear to require subject-specific training data. The results suggest that multiple accelerometers aid in recognition because conjunctions in acceleration feature values can effectively discriminate many activities. With just two biaxial accelerometers - thigh and wrist - the recognition performance dropped only slightly. This is the first work to investigate performance of recognition algorithms with multiple, wire-free accelerometers on 20 activities using datasets annotated by the subjects themselves.","authors":["Ling Bao","Stephen S.
