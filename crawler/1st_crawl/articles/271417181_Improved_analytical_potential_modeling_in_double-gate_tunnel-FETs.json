{"id":"271417181_Improved_analytical_potential_modeling_in_double-gate_tunnel-FETs","abstract":"In the last few years, the Tunnel-FET has become one of the promising devices to be the successor of the MOSFET due to its CMOS compatibility and steep subthreshold slopes (S) below 60 mV/dec. The rapid forthcoming of research regarding the Tunnel-FET leads to a wide range of studied device geometries, different hetero-structure combinations and applied technological methods. All with the aim of improving the device ON-state current and subthreshold slope. In order to accurately model this Tunnel-FET variety a precise potential model of the whole device is inevitable. This work shows an improved two-dimensional closed-form potential model applying the conformal mapping technique. To validate the model, all results are compared against TCAD Sentaurus simulation data.","authors":["Michael Graef","Thomas Holtij","Franziska Hain","Alexander Kloes"],"meta":["June 2014","DOI:10.1109/MIXDES.2014.6872151","Conference: 2014 MIXDES - 21st International Conference \"Mixed Design of Integrated Circuits & Systems\""],"references":["263269478_Modeling_of_the_Impact_of_SourceDrain_Regions_on_Short_Channel_Effects_in_MOSFETs","228723526_Low-Voltage_Tunnel_Transistors_for_Beyond_CMOS_Logic","3257073_Tunneling_Field-Effect_Transistors_TFETs_With_Subthreshold_Swing_SS_Less_Than_60_mVdec","259717527_Two-Dimensional_Physics-Based_Modeling_of_Electrostatics_and_Band-to-Band_Tunneling_in_Tunnel-FETs","258792713_Semianalytical_Model_of_the_Subthreshold_Current_in_Short-Channel_Junctionless_Symmetric_Double-Gate_Field-Effect_Transistors","230667664_Analytical_Compact_Modeling_Framework_for_the_2D_Electrostatics_in_Lightly_Doped_Double-Gate_MOSFETs","224532785_Statistical_comparisons_of_data_on_band-gap_narrowing_in_heavily_doped_silicon_Electrical_and_optical_measurements","224348970_Three-Dimensional_Closed-Form_Model_for_Potential_Barrier_in_Undoped_FinFETs_Resulting_in_Analytical_Equations_for_V_T_and_Subthreshold_Slope","4161709_Simultaneous_measurement_of_hole_lifetime_hole_mobility_and_bandgap_narrowing_in_heavily_doped_n-type_silicon","3252820_Quantum-mechanical_effects_on_the_threshold_voltage_of_ultrathin-SOI_NMOSFETs","3075483_Semi-Analytical_Modeling_of_Short-Channel_Effects_in_Si_and_Ge_Symmetrical_Double-Gate_MOSFETs"]}
