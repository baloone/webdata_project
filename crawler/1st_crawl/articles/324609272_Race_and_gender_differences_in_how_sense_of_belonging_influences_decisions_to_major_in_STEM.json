{"id":"324609272_Race_and_gender_differences_in_how_sense_of_belonging_influences_decisions_to_major_in_STEM","abstract":"Background\nWomen and students of color are widely underrepresented in most STEM fields. In order to investigate this underrepresentation, we interviewed 201 college seniors, primarily women and people of color, who either majored in STEM or started but dropped a STEM major. Here we discuss one section of the longer interview that focused on students’ sense of belonging, which has been found to be related to retention. In our analysis, we examine the intersections of race and gender with students’ sense of belonging, a topic largely absent from the current literature.\n\nResults\nWe found that white men were most likely to report a sense of belonging whereas women of color were the least likely. Further, we found that representation within one’s STEM sub-discipline, namely biology versus the physical sciences, impacts sense of belonging for women. Four key factors were found to contribute to sense of belonging for all students interviewed: interpersonal relationships, perceived competence, personal interest, and science identity.\n\nConclusions\nOur findings indicate that students who remain in STEM majors report a greater sense of belonging than those who leave STEM. Additionally, we found that students from underrepresented groups are less likely to feel they belong. These findings highlight structural and cultural features of universities, as well as STEM curricula and pedagogy, that continue to privilege white males.","authors":["Katherine Rainey","Melissa Dancy","Roslyn Mickelson","Elizabeth Stearns"],"meta":["April 2018International Journal of STEM Education 5(1):10","DOI:10.1186/s40594-018-0115-6"],"references":["318839581_Counterspaces_for_women_of_color_in_STEM_higher_education_Marginal_and_central_spaces_for_persistence_and_success_COUNTERSPACES_FOR_WOMEN_OF_COLOR_IN_STEM_EDUCATION","264896192_The_Grass_Is_Greener_in_Non-Science_Technology_Engineering_and_Math_Classes_Examining_the_Role_of_Competing_Belonging_to_Undergraduate_Women's_Vulnerability_to_Being_Pulled_Away_From_Science","302930119_Mapping_the_margins_Intersectionality_identity_politics_and_violence_against_women_of_color","287041785_College_Students'_Sense_of_Belonging_A_Key_to_Educational_Success_for_All_Students","277926242_Pipelines_and_Pathways_Women_of_Color_in_Undergraduate_STEM_Majors_and_the_College_Experiences_That_Contribute_to_Persistence","275452947_Moving_Latinoa_Students_Into_STEM_Majors_in_College_The_Role_of_Teachers_and_Professional_Communities_in_Secondary_Schools","274738776_Intersectionality's_Definitional_Dilemmas","265925564_Campus_Racial_Climate_Perceptions_and_Overall_Sense_of_Belonging_Among_Racially_Diverse_Women_in_STEM_Majors","264799698_Women_Minorities_and_Persons_with_Disabilities_in_Science_and_Engineering_2011_NSF_11-309","263537621_Mapping_the_Margins_Intersectionality_Identity_Politics_and_Violence_Against_Women_of_Color"]}
