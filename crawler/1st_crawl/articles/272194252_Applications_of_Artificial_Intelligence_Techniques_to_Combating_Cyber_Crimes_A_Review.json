{"id":"272194252_Applications_of_Artificial_Intelligence_Techniques_to_Combating_Cyber_Crimes_A_Review","abstract":"With the advances in information technology (IT) criminals are using cyberspace to commit numerous\ncyber crimes. Cyber infrastructures are highly vulnerable to intrusions and other threats. Physical devices\nand human intervention are not sufficient for monitoring and protection of these infrastructures; hence,\nthere is a need for more sophisticated cyber defense systems that need to be flexible, adaptable and robust,\nand able to detect a wide variety of threats and make intelligent real-time decisions. Numerous bio-inspired\ncomputing methods of Artificial Intelligence have been increasingly playing an important role in cyber\ncrime detection and prevention. The purpose of this study is to present advances made so far in the field of\napplying AI techniques for combating cyber crimes, to demonstrate how these techniques can be a","authors":["Selma Dilek","Hüseyin Çakır","Mustafa Aydın"],"meta":["February 2015International Journal of Artificial Intelligence & Applications 6(1)","DOI:10.5121/ijaia.2015.6102","SourcearXiv"],"references":["272139763_Artificial_Intelligence_in_Cyber_Defense","271482166_A_hybrid_approach_for_dynamic_intrusion_detection_in_ad_hoc_networks_using_genetic_algorithm_and_artificial_immune_system","268057589_Artificial_Intelligence_Technique_Applied_to_Intrusion_Detection","267718557_Mobile_Intelligent_Agents_to_Fight_Cyber_Intrusions","327833410_Encyclopedia_of_Victimology_and_Crime_Prevention","311563064_Application_of_Artificial_Neural_Network_in_Detection_of_DOS_Attacks","286668747_Intrusion_detection_system_using_genetic_algorithm","272161464_Artificial_Intelligence_A_Modern_Approach_Second_Edition","271451656_Design_an_anomaly_based_fuzzy_intrusion_detection_system_for_packet_dropping_attack_in_mobile_ad_hoc_networks","269327951_An_agent-based_approach_for_building_an_intrusion_detection_system"]}
