{"id":"315463939_Multisensor_Feature_Fusion_for_Bearing_Fault_Diagnosis_Using_Sparse_Autoencoder_and_Deep_Belief_Network","abstract":"To assess health conditions of rotating machinery efficiently, multiple accelerometers are mounted on different locations to acquire a variety of possible faults signals. The statistical features are extracted from these signals to identify the running status of a machine. However, the acquired vibration signals are different due to sensor's arrangement and environmental interference, which may lead to different diagnostic results. In order to improve the fault diagnosis reliability, a new multisensor data fusion technique is proposed. First, time-domain and frequency-domain features are extracted from the different sensor signals, and then these features are input into multiple two-layer sparse autoencoder (SAE) neural networks for feature fusion. Finally, fused feature vectors can be regarded as the machine health indicators, and be used to train deep belief network (DBN) for further classification. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed SAE-DBN scheme, the bearing fault experiments were conducted on a bearing test platform, and the vibration data sets under different running speeds were collected for algorithm validation. For comparison, different feature fusion methods were also applied to multisensor fusion in the experiments. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed approach can effectively identify the machine running conditions and significantly outperform other fusion methods.","authors":["Zhuyun Chen","Weihua Li"],"meta":["March 2017IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement PP(99):1-10","DOI:10.1109/TIM.2017.2669947"],"references":["303793561_Multi-LeapMotion_sensor_based_demonstration_for_robotic_refine_tabletop_object_manipulation_task","303311787_Discriminant_Correlation_Analysis_Real-Time_Feature_Level_Fusion_for_Multimodal_Biometric_Recognition","291184767_Fault_detection_and_classification_by_unsupervised_feature_extraction_and_dimensionality_reduction","281949003_Bearing_Health_monitoring_based_on_Hilbert-Huang_Transform_Support_Vector_Machine_and_Regression","281863415_Fault_diagnosis_of_spur_gearbox_based_on_random_forest_and_wavelet_packet_decomposition","228339739_Viualizing_data_using_t-SNE","215991023_Learning_Deep_Architectures_for_AI","309186321_A_practical_guide_to_training_restricted_boltzmann_machinesJ","305686197_Machine_fault_classification_using_deep_belief_network","304188242_Fault_Diagnosis_Using_a_Joint_Model_Based_on_Sparse_Representation_and_SVM","303953039_Multisensory_fusion_based_virtual_tool_wear_sensing_for_ubiquitous_manufacturing","300086681_A_Sparse_Auto-encoder-Based_Deep_Neural_Network_Approach_for_Induction_Motor_Faults_Classification","282464698_Multi-sensor_Image_Enhanced_Fusion_Algorithm_Based_on_NSST_and_Top-hat_Transformation","282310786_Rolling_bearing_fault_diagnosis_using_an_optimization_deep_belief_network","273393295_Fault_Detection_and_Classification_in_Medium_Voltage_DC_Shipboard_Power_Systems_With_Wavelets_and_Artificial_Neural_Networks","260303648_Novel_Industrial_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_for_Machine_Condition_Monitoring_and_Fault_Diagnosis","260033698_An_approach_to_fault_diagnosis_of_reciprocating_compressor_valves_using_Teager-Kaiser_energy_operator_and_deep_belief_networks","257392258_Failure_diagnosis_using_deep_belief_learning_based_health_state_classification","241176830_Graph-modified_neighborhood_preserving_embedding_based_on_feature_fusion","224086131_Feature_Fusion_Using_Locally_Linear_Embedding_for_Classification","222544986_Machinery_fault_diagnosis_based_on_fuzzy_measure_and_fuzzy_integral_data_fusion_techniques","220407980_Fuel-Type_Identification_Using_Joint_Probability_Density_Arbiter_and_Soft-Computing_Techniques","23643784_Multisensor-Based_Human_Detection_and_Tracking_for_Mobile_Service_Robots","7017915_A_Fast_Learning_Algorithm_for_Deep_Belief_Nets"]}
