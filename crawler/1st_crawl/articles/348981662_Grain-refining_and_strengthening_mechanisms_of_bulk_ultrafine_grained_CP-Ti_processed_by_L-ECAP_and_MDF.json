{"id":"348981662_Grain-refining_and_strengthening_mechanisms_of_bulk_ultrafine_grained_CP-Ti_processed_by_L-ECAP_and_MDF","abstract":"The microstructural evolution and mechanical properties of ultrafine-grained (UFG) CP-Ti after an innovative large-volume equal channel angular pressing (L-ECAP) and multi-directional forging (MDF) were systematically examined using monotonic tensile tests combined with a transmission electron microscope (TEM) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) techniques. Substantially refined and homogeneous microstructures were achieved after L-ECAP (8-pass and 12-pass) and MDF (2-cycle and 3-cycle), respectively, where the grain size distribution conformed to lognormal distribution. The grain refinement of 450 Â°C L-ECAP is dominated by dynamic recrystallization (DRX) and dynamic recovery (DRV), while that of MDF is dominated by DRX. The iron impurities promote recrystallization by pinning-induced dislocation accumulation so that DRX is prone to occur at iron segregation regions during L-ECAP. The monotonic tensile results show that the strain hardening rate of CP-Ti increases with the decrease of grain size, while the continuous strain hardening ability decreases. The relationship between the average grain size and yield strength is in accordance with Hall-Petch relationship. Meanwhile, the individual strengthening mechanisms were quantitatively examined by the modified model. The results indicate that the strengthening contribution of dislocation accumulation to yield strength is greater than that of grain refinement.","authors":["Peng-cheng Zhao","Guang-Jian Yuan","Run-Zi
