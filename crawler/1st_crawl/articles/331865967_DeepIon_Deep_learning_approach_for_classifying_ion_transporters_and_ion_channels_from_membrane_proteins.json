{"id":"331865967_DeepIon_Deep_learning_approach_for_classifying_ion_transporters_and_ion_channels_from_membrane_proteins","abstract":"The movement of ions across the cell membrane is an essential for many biological processes. This study is focused on ion channels and ion transporters (pumps) as types of border guards control the incessant traffic of ions across cell membranes. Ion channels and ion transporters function to regulate membrane potential and electrical signaling and play important roles in cell proliferation, migration, apoptosis, and differentiation. In their behaviors, it is found that ion channels differ significantly from ion transporters. Therefore, a method for automatically classifying ion transporters and ion channels from membrane proteins is proposed by training deep neural networks and using the position‐specific scoring matrix profile as an input. The key of novelty is the three‐stage approach, in which five techniques for data normalization are used; next three imbalanced data techniques are applied to the minority classes and then, six classifiers are compared with the proposed method. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. This article presents a deep learning approach using convolutional neural networks and position‐specific scoring matrix profiles of protein sequences to classify ion transporters and ion channels from membrane proteins. Our proposed technique describes a new predictor that capable to increase the performance of classification which uses an efficient combination of feature normalization techniques and imbalanced data set techniques. The results show that the proposed method can capture the hidden patterns information more accurate in the feature sets.","authors":["Semmy Wellem Taju","Yu Yen Ou"],"meta":["March 2019Journal of
