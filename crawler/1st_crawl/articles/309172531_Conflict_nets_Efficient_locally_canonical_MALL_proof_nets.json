{"id":"309172531_Conflict_nets_Efficient_locally_canonical_MALL_proof_nets","abstract":"Proof nets for MLL (unit-free multiplicative linear logic) and ALL (unit-free additive linear logic) are graphical abstractions of proofs which are efficient (proofs translate in linear time) and canonical (invariant under rule commutation). This paper solves a three-decade open problem: are there efficient canonical proof nets for MALL (unit-free multiplicative-additive linear logic)?\nHonouring MLL and ALL canonicity, in which all commutations are strictly local proof-tree rewrites, we define local canonicity for MALL: invariance under local rule commutation. We present new proof nets for MALL, called conflict nets, which are both efficient and locally canonical.","authors":["Dominic Hughes","Willem Heijltjes"],"meta":["July 2016","DOI:10.1145/2933575.2934559","Conference: the 31st Annual ACM/IEEE Symposium"],"references":["266659012_No_proof_nets_for_MLL_with_units_proof_equivalence_in_MLL_is_PSPACE-complete","257823431_Bicartesian_Coherence","236682977_Linear_Logic_without_Units","222703225_Towards_Hilbert's_24th_Problem_Combinatorial_Proof_Invariants","220896429_Retractile_Proof_Nets_of_the_Purely_Multiplicative_and_Additive_Fragment_of_Linear_Logic","220369468_A_Local_Graph-rewriting_System_for_Deciding_Equality_in_Sum-product_Theories","220367215_Contractible_Coherence_Spaces_and_Maximal_Maps","220261651_An_approach_to_a_systematic_theorem_proving_procedure_in_first-order_logic","45193781_Canonical_Sequent_Proofs_via_Multi-Focusing","4350467_Cut_elimination_for_monomial_MALL_proof_nets","4175502_Ludics_Nets_a_game_Model_of_Concurrent_Interaction","2252350_Subnets_of_Proof-nets_in_MLL-","2118911_Modelling_Linear_Logic_Without_Units_Preliminary_Results","311707274_Proof_nets_and_semi-star-autonomous_categories","308740319_Complexity_Bounds_for_Sum-Product_Logic_via_Additive_Proof_Nets_and_Petri_Nets","296932741_Electronic_Notes_in_Theoretical_Computer_Science_Preface","281419782_Connection_proof_search_methods_in_Linear_Logic_and_proof_nets_construction","278623278_Proof_nets_and_semi-star-autonomous_categories","272027306_MALL_proof_equivalence_is_Logspace-complete_via_binary_decision_diagrams","261055518_Game_Semantics_in_String_Diagrams","259967636_Bicartesian_Coherence","256269665_Coherence_in_Closed_Categories","249241922_Polarized_Proof-Nets_Proof-Nets_for_LC","242258475_An_approach_to_innocent_strategies_as_graphs","239043166_Proof-nets_the_parallel_syntax_for_proof_theory","228929964_The_geometry_of_tensor_calculus_II","224251020_Proof_Nets_for_Additive_Linear_Logic_with_Units","221942985_Linear_Logic","221442727_Proof_Nets_for_Unit-free_Multiplicative-Additive_Linear_Logic_Extended_abstract","220829388_On_the_Computational_Complexity_of_Cut-Elimination_in_Linear_Logic","220149690_Connection_Methods_in_Linear_Logic_and_Proof_Nets_Construction_Generation_in_Mixed_Logics","28137338_Proofs_Without_Syntax","4350466_Correctness_of_Multiplicative_Additive_Proof_Structures_is_NL-Complete","3811868_Correctness_of_multiplicative_proof_nets_is_linear","3046701_Refutations_by_Matings","2929305_Proof_Nets_for_Unit-free_Multiplicative-Additive_Linear_Logic","1906998_Abstract_p-time_proof_nets_for_MALL_Conflict_nets"]}
