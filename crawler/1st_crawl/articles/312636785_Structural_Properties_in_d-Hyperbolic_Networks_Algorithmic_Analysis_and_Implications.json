{"id":"312636785_Structural_Properties_in_d-Hyperbolic_Networks_Algorithmic_Analysis_and_Implications","abstract":"In graph theory, the δ-hyperbolicity is a global property that shows how close a given graph's structure is to the tree's structure metrically. It embeds multiple properties that facilitate solving several problems that found to be hard in the general graph form. Interestingly, not only that δ-hyperbolicity provides an idea about the structure of the graph, but also it explains how information navigates throughout the network. Therefore, δ-hyperbolicity has several applications in diverse applied fields. My PhD dissertation focuses on analyzing and exploiting structural properties of hyperbolic networks for different applications.","authors":["Hend Alrasheed"],"meta":["April 2016","DOI:10.1145/2872518.2888602","Conference: the 25th International Conference Companion"],"references":["282711294_Core-Periphery_Models_for_Graphs_Based_on_their_d-Hyperbolicity_An_Example_Using_Biological_Networks","277192570_The_Large_Scale_Curvature_of_Networks","261732157_Topological_implications_of_negative_curvature_for_biological_and_social_networks","224261389_Treewidth_and_Hyperbolicity_of_the_Internet","222151359_Network_Structure_And_Minimum_DegreeSoc_Netw_5269-287","221804805_Large-scale_curvature_of_networks","220223696_Additive_Spanners_and_Distance_and_Routing_Labeling_Schemes_for_Hyperbolic_Graphs","2209684_Community_Structure_in_Large_Networks_Natural_Cluster_Sizes_and_the_Absence_of_Large_Well-Defined_Clusters","301233247_Network_structure_and_minimum_degree","266436899_Conditions_of_coincidence_of_the_local_and_global_minima_of_the_eccentricity_function_on_graphs_and_the_Helly_property","265681744_Hyperbolic_Groups","220483876_On_Compact_Routing_for_the_Internet","220188676_Eccentricity-approximating_trees_in_chordal_graphs","7388884_Core-periphery_organization_of_complex_networks","4102787_On_the_Curvature_of_the_Internet_and_its_usage_for_Overlay_Construction_and_Distance_Estimation"]}
