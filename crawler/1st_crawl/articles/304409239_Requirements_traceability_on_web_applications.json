{"id":"304409239_Requirements_traceability_on_web_applications","abstract":"The development of software products is currently being expanded to be based on web applications. Due to the time constraints, software design and development for web applications are driven. It leads the software or applications become more complex. Identifying impacts of changes or relations takes a lot of time and effort. One challenge is to enable traceability on software artefacts created during the development of web applications. Moreover, it is believed that analysis of data obtained from traceability relations is another way to make software process more efficient. However, it is absolutely not an easy task due to lack of guidelines, support, and tools. This research thus aims to enable software traceability on the development of web applications which involve many types of documents.","authors":["Waraporn Jirapanthong"],"meta":["October 2015","DOI:10.1109/ICITEED.2015.7408905","Conference: 2015 7th International Conference on Information Technology and Electrical Engineering (ICITEE)"],"references":["324975110_The_association_for_computing_machinery","244476026_Oows_A_method_to_develop_web_applications_from_web-oriented_conceptual_models","232617906_Web_EngineeringCreating_a_Discipline_among_Disciplines","223577770_The_OO-Method_approach_for_information_systems_modeling_From_object-oriented_conceptual_modeling_to_automated_programming","32885320_An_Analysis_of_the_Requirements_Traceability_Problem"]}
