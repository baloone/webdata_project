{"id":"23485712_Algorithm_of_first-aid_management_of_dental_trauma_for_medics_and_corpsmen","abstract":"In order to fill the discrepancy between the necessity of providing prompt and proper treatment to dental trauma patients, and the inadequate knowledge among medics and corpsmen, as well as the lack of instructions in first-aid textbook and manuals, and after reviewing the dental literature, a simple algorithm for non-professional first-aid management for various injuries to hard (teeth) and soft oral tissues, is presented. The recommended management of tooth avulsion, subluxation and luxation, crown fracture and lip, tongue or gingival laceration included in the algorithm. Along with a list of after-hour dental clinics, this symptoms- and clinical-appearance-based algorithm is suited to tuck easily into a pocket for quick utilization by medics/corpsmen in an emergency situation. Although the algorithm was developed for the usage of military non-dental health-care providers, this method could be adjusted and employed in the civilian environment as well.","authors":["Yehuda Zadik"],"meta":["January 2009Dental Traumatology 24(6):698-701","DOI:10.1111/j.1600-9657.2008.00649.x","SourcePubMed"],"references":["14890109_The_management_of_dental_problems_presenting_to_an_accident_and_emergency_department","12275538_A_Literature_Review_of_Dental_Casualty_Rates","8520892_Therapeutic_protocols_for_avulsed_permanent_teeth_review_and_Clinical_Update","19791150_Evaluation_of_the_'Golden_Period'_for_wound_repair_204_cases_from_a_third_world_emergency_department","14013767_Investigation_of_lay_knowledge_of_the_avulsed_permanent_incisors","14013760_Bacterial_penetration_of_the_root_canal_of_intact_incisor_teeth_of_a_simulated_traumatic_injury","13907139_The_dental_emergency","13896915_Evaluation_and_Management_of_Traumatic_Lacerations","13079577_Patient_and_parental_awareness_of_the_immediate_management_of_traumatised_teeth","12353841_Dentoalveolar_trauma","11866741_Lay_knowledge_of_physical_education_teachers_about_the_emergency_management_of_dental_trauma_in_Hong_Kong","11866740_Dental_trauma_management_awareness_of_Singapore_pre-school_teachers","11776535_Avulsed_permanent_incisors_Knowledge_and_attitude_of_primary_school_teachers_with_regard_to_emergency_management","11580427_US_Army_Dental_Emergency_Rates_in_Bosnia","11317520_Avulsion_and_replantation","11268629_Effect_of_treatment_delay_upon_pulp_and_periodontal_healing_of_traumatic_dental_injuries_-_A_review_article","10937294_Knowledge_of_physicians_in_hospital_emergency_rooms_in_Israel_on_their_role_in_case_of_avulsion_of_permanent_incisors","8419736_Dental_Emergency_Rates_at_Two_Expeditionary_Medical_Support_Facilities_Supporting_Operations_Enduring_and_Iraqi_Freedom","8255196_Effect_of_education_and_guidelines_for_treatment_of_uncomplicated_dental_pain_on_patient_and_provider_behavior","8109498_Training_in_oral_disease_diagnosis_and_treatment_for_medical_students_and_doctors_in_the_United_Kingdom","7846476_Injury_assessing","7741961_Dental_Morbidity_in_United_Kingdom_Armed_Forces_Iraq_2003","7580401_Dentist_versus_doctor","7349465_Antibiotic_coverage_for_lip_wound","7138505_Physician_and_emergency_medical_technicians'_knowledge_and_experience_regarding_dental_trauma","6440859_Guidelines_for_the_management_of_traumatic_dental_injuries_I_Fractures_and_luxations_of_permanent_teeth","6320327_Guidelines_for_the_management_of_traumatic_dental_injuries_II_Avulsion_of_permanent_teeth","6037968_Oral_trauma_and_dental_emergency_management_recommendations_of_first-aid_textbooks_and_manuals","5361963_Referral_practice_of_military_corpsmen_regarding_dento-alveolar_trauma"]}
