{"id":"224279054_Performance_evaluation_of_the_VF_graph_matching_algorithm","abstract":"The paper discusses the performance of a graph matching algorithm\ntailored for dealing with large graphs in computer vision without using\ninformation about the topology of the graphs to be matched. The\nalgorithm, presented in more detail in other papers (and publicly\navailable on the WWW as VF), is now discussed with reference to its\ncomputational complexity and memory requirements. The performance\nanalysis is carried out by theoretically characterizing the matching\ntime and the required memory in the best and worst cases. The\ntheoretical analysis is completed by tests on a database of graphs\nrandomly generated. The algorithm is compared with the one proposed by\nUllmann (1976): experimental results confirmed the theoretical\nexpectations, highlighting the overall efficiency of the algorithm. Some\nresults obtained by researchers who recently used the algorithm in\napplication domains requiring a massive use of graph matching techniques\nare finally reported","authors":["L.P.
