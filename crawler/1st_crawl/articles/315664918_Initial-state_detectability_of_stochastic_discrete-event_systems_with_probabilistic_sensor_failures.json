{"id":"315664918_Initial-state_detectability_of_stochastic_discrete-event_systems_with_probabilistic_sensor_failures","abstract":"Initial-state estimation is an important problem in discrete-event systems. In this problem, the initial-state of the system is unknown and one wants to determine the initial-state of the system based on its observation. In this paper, we investigate the problem of initial-state detection of partially-observed discrete-event systems in the stochastic setting. We consider two sources of randomness in this problem: stochastic dynamic of the system and probabilistic sensor failures. Specifically, we model a stochastic discrete-event system by a probabilistic finite-state automaton and we use a probabilistic projection function as the observation model. The notion of stochastic initial-state detectability (SI-detectability) is introduced in order to capture whether or not the probability of detecting the initial-state converges to one even in the presence of potential sensor failures. An approach for the verification of SI-detectability is proposed. We also investigate the complexity of the SI-detectability verification problem and we show that this problem is PSPACE-complete.","authors":["Xiang Yin"],"meta":["June 2017Automatica 80:127-134","DOI:10.1016/j.automatica.2017.02.032"],"references":["304410814_A_general_approach_for_solving_dynamic_sensor_activation_problems_for_a_class_of_properties","283672289_Codiagnosability_and_coobservability_under_dynamic_observations_Transformation_and_verification","282426709_A_Uniform_Approach_for_Synthesizing_Property-Enforcing_Supervisors_for_Partially-Observed_Discrete-Event_Systems","281050656_Foundation_of_Diagnosis_and_Predictability_in_Probabilistic_Systems","268689423_I-Detectability_of_Discrete-Event_Systems","261154349_Initial_state_opacity_in_stochastic_DES","260662488_Online_Sensor_Activation_for_Detectability_of_Discrete_Event_Systems","260516405_Enforcing_Detectability_in_Controlled_Discrete_Event_Systems","224560983_Minimum_Initial_Marking_Estimation_in_Labeled_Petri_Nets","224322620_Diagnosability_of_stochastic_discrete-event_systems_under_unreliable_observations","224116001_Maximum_Likelihood_Failure_Diagnosis_in_Finite_State_Machines_Under_Unreliable_Observations","216813077_Introduction_to_Discrete_Event_Systems","3032952_Detectability_of_Discrete_Event_Systems","3032073_Diagnosability_of_stochastic_discrete-event_systems","309057248_Quantification_of_Secrecy_in_Partially_Observed_Stochastic_Discrete_Event_Systems","301791631_Revised_Test_for_Stochastic_Diagnosability_of_Discrete-Event_Systems","282922920_Detectability_in_stochastic_discrete_event_systems","282794231_On_computing_indistinguishable_states_of_nondeterministic_finite_automata_with_partially_observable_transitions","277013366_Stochastic_Failure_Prognosability_of_Discrete_Event_Systems","273161723_Failure_Detection_Framework_for_Stochastic_Discrete_Event_Systems_With_Guaranteed_Error_Bounds","271549565_Probabilistic_Marking_Estimation_in_Labeled_Petri_Nets","267654225_Control_of_Networked_Discrete_Event_Systems_Dealing_with_Communication_Delays_and_Losses","260711447_Current-State_Opacity_Formulations_in_Probabilistic_Finite_Automata","256660820_Robust_diagnosis_of_discrete_event_systems_against_intermittent_loss_of_observations","242537421_Word_problems_requiring_exponential_time","226521978_State_Observation_and_Diagnosis_of_Discrete-Event_Systems_Described_by_Stochastic_Automata","225970369_Invertibility_of_Discrete-Event_Dynamic_Systems","222216339_Relationships_between_nondeterministic_and_deterministic_tape_complexities","220387247_Verification_of_Codiagnosability_for_Discrete_Event_Systems_Modeled_by_Mealy_Automata_With_Nondeterministic_Output_Functions","40443857_State_Estimation_and_Detectability_of_Probabilistic_Discrete_Event_Systems","4364926_Verification_of_initial-state_opacity_in_security_applications_of_DES","3020641_Observability_of_Discrete_Event_Dynamic_Systems"]}
