{"id":"225953511_Fragments_of_First-Order_Logic_over_Infinite_Words","abstract":"We give topological and algebraic characterizations as well as language theoretic descriptions of the following subclasses\nof first-order logic FO[<] for ω-languages: Σ2, FO2, FO2∩Σ2, and Δ2 (and by duality Π2 and FO2∩Π2). These descriptions extend the respective results for finite words. In particular, we relate the above fragments to language\nclasses of certain (unambiguous) polynomials. An immediate consequence is the decidability of the membership problem of these\nclasses, but this was shown before by Wilke (Classifying Discrete Temporal Properties. Habilitationsschrift, Universität Kiel,\nApril 1998) and Bojańczyk (Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol.4962, pp.172–185, 2008) and is therefore not our main focus. The paper is about the interplay of algebraic, topological, and language theoretic\nproperties.\n\nKeywordsInfinite words–Regular languages–First-order logic–Automata theory–Semigroups–Topology","authors":["Volker Diekert","Manfred Kufleitner"],"meta":["February 2009Theory of Computing Systems 48(3):486-516","DOI:10.1007/s00224-010-9266-7","SourcearXiv"],"references":["344485184_Varieties_of_Formal_Languages","313627754_The_equivalence_problem_for_regular_expressions_with_squaring_requires_exponential_space","283926055_Diamonds_are_forever_The_variety_DA","282241103_Over_words_two_variables_are_as_powerful_as_one_quantifier_alternation_FO2_S2_at_the_intersection_of_all_sets_P2","265756154_Tree_Languages_Definable_with_One_Quantifier_Alternation","262322971_The_common_fragment_of_ACTL_and_LTL","262256066_An_Eilenberg_theorem_for_-languages","246713384_Locally_trivial_categories_and_unambiguous_concatenation","243764858_Finiteness_of_the_odd_perfect_and_primitive_abundant_numbers_with_n_distinct_prime_factors","241010750_On_a_Problem_of_Formal_Logic"]}
