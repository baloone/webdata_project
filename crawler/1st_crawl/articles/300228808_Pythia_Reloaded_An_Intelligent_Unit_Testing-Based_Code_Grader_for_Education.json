{"id":"300228808_Pythia_Reloaded_An_Intelligent_Unit_Testing-Based_Code_Grader_for_Education","abstract":"Automatic assessment of code to support education is an important feature of many programming learning platforms. Unit testing frameworks can be used to perform a systematic functional test of codes; they are mainly used by developers. Competition graders can be used to safely execute code in sandboxed environments; they are mainly used for programming contests. This paper proposes a platform combining the advantages of unit testing and competition graders to provide a unit testing-based grader. The proposed platform assesses codes and produces relevant and “intelligent” feedbacks to support learning. The paper presents the architecture of the platform and how the unit tests are designed.","authors":["Sébastien Combéfis","Alexis Paques"],"meta":["July 2015","DOI:10.1145/2792404.2792407","Conference: 1st Int'l Code Hunt Workshop on Educational Software EngineeringAt: Baltimore, MD, USA","Project: Pythia Project"],"references":["340583780_Recasting_a_Traditional_Course_into_a_MOOC_by_Means_of_a_SPOC","308822905_Code_Hunt_Experience_with_Coding_Contests_at_Scale","262328132_Automated_Assessment_of_Programming_Assignments","230822093_Teaching_Programming_and_Algorithm_Design_with_Pythia_a_Web-Based_Learning_Platform","220808258_Experiences_with_Marmoset_designing_and_using_an_advanced_submission_and_testing_system_for_programming_courses","44961364_An_Infrastructure_for_Mechanised_Grading","263849049_Extreme_Programming_Explained_Embrace_Change","242350998_Extreme_Programming_Explained_Embrace_Change","238732289_A_user-mode_port_of_the_Linux_kernel","222942422_Automated_Feedback_Generation_for_Introductory_Programming_Assignments"]}
