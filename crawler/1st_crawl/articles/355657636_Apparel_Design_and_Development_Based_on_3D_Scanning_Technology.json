{"id":"355657636_Apparel_Design_and_Development_Based_on_3D_Scanning_Technology","abstract":"With the development of computer science, especially the application of 3D scanning technology in garment design, intelligent modeling is realized, which is impossible to achieve in traditional design methods. In this paper, we propose the 3D model construction of human garments based on the motion recovery structure method. The eigenmatrix is obtained from the camera parameters, and the transformation matrix is calculated by matching the image feature points with the help of scale-invariant feature conversion algorithm to realize the 3D reconstruction technology of human garments based on multiview image sequences. The effectiveness of this method is verified through experiments, and it has good robustness and accuracy. Through the form of style modeling, the design thinking and method can be extended to form a more reasonable garment structure and guide the innovation of garment production mode.","authors":["Guodong Zhang"],"meta":["October 2021Scientific Programming 2021(1):1-7","DOI:10.1155/2021/7933206"],"references":["353490623_Forest_Fire_Recognition_Based_on_Feature_Extraction_from_Multi-View_Images","352892703_Industrial_Perspectives_of_3D_scanning_Features_Roles_and_it's_Analytical_Applications","349491078_Innovative_design_of_a_helmet_based_on_reverse_engineering_and_3D_printing","342060634_Personal_protective_ensemble_reference_size_development_for_Indian_male_defence_personnel_based_on_3D_whole_body_anthropometric_scan","329913682_Utilizing_Active_Sensor_Nodes_in_Smart_Environments_for_Optimal_Communication_Coverage","328358382_Positioning_Optimization_Based_on_Particle_Quality_Prediction_in_Wireless_sensor_networks","325489301_3D_Scanning_Applications_in_Medical_field_A_Literature-based_Review","323853961_Expanding_the_Concept_of_Lead_Users_as_Collaborators_in_Functional_Apparel_Design","320970922_Fat_fashion_Fattening_pedagogy_in_apparel_design","354223146_Super_efficiency_SBM-DEA_and_neural_network_for_performance_evaluation","293636725_Design_and_development_of_western-style_Nigerian_apparel","317831135_Protecting_the_privacy_of_humans_in_video_sequences_using_a_computer_vision-based_de-identification_pipeline","302058759_From_stretchable_to_reconfigurable_inorganic_electronics","286729072_Design_and_Development_of_Novel_Ventilated_Clothing","283654950_Development_of_individualized_pattern_prototype_based_on_classification_of_body_features"]}
