{"id":"325987616_Monitoring_Time_Intervals","abstract":"Run-time checking of timed properties requires to monitor events occurring within a specified time interval. In a distributed setting, working with intervals is complicated due to uncertainties about network delays and clock synchronization. Determining that an interval can be closed - i.e., that all events occurring within the interval have been observed - cannot be done without a delay. In this paper, we consider how an appropriate delay can be determined based on parameters of a monitoring setup, such as network delay, clock skew and clock rate. We then propose a generic scheme for monitoring time intervals, parameterized by the detection delay, and discuss the use of this monitoring scheme to check different timed specifications, including real-time temporal logics and rate calculations.","authors":["Teng Zhang","John Wiegley","Insup Lee","Oleg Sokolsky"],"meta":["September 2017"],"references":["340514944_Java-MaC_A_Run-time_Assurance_Approach_for_Java_Programs","287044763_Runtime_enforcement_of_timed_properties_revisited","228392742_From_Poisson_Processes_to_Self-Similarity_a_Survey_of_Network_Traffic_Models","227050141_Rewriting-Based_Techniques_for_Runtime_Verification","222553025_Collecting_Statistics_Over_Runtime_Executions","220762707_LarvaStat_Monitoring_of_Statistical_Properties","303969025_Monitoring_and_checking_of_real-time_and_probabilistic_properties","300020081_On_Real-Time_Monitoring_with_Imprecise_Timestamps","242609546_On_the_self-similar_nature_of_Ethernet_traffic","220329686_Adding_Time_to_Synchronous_Process_Communications","44257015_Rule_Systems_for_Run-Time_Monitoring_From_Eagle_to_RuleR","30848846_Runtime_Monitoring_of_Timing_Constraints_in_Distributed_Real-Time_Systems","3042671_A_Performance_Analysis_of_Timed_Synchronous_Communication_Primitives"]}
