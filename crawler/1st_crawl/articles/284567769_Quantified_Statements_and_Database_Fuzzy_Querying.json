{"id":"284567769_Quantified_Statements_and_Database_Fuzzy_Querying","abstract":"Many propositions to extend database management systems have been made in the last decade. Some of them aim to support a wider range of queries involving fuzzy predicates and this paper focuses on the evaluation of a particular subset of queries, namely those using fuzzy quantified predicates. More precisely, we consider the queries which can be represented by a statement of the type “Q X are A” where Q is a fuzzy quantifier, X a set of items of the database and A a fuzzy predicate. The evaluation of this kind of statement is considered according to the propositions of Zadeh, Prade and Yager. We show that Prade and Yager’s interpretation of “Q X are A”, when Q is a monotonous quantifier, are respectively equivalent to a Sugeno and a Choquet fuzzy integral. Thanks to some properties of an α-cut and of fuzzy integrals, we are able to show that the evaluation of these queries, according to these three propositions, can be significantly improved with respect to a naïve strategy based on the exhaustive scan of set X.","authors":["Patrick Bosc","Ludovic Lietard","Olivier Pivert"],"meta":["January 1995","DOI:10.1007/978-3-7908-1897-0_12","In book: Fuzziness in Database Management Systems (pp.275-308)"],"references":["283994482_Possibility_and_necessity_in_a_pattern_matching_process","223947114_A_computational_approach_to_fuzzy_quantifiers_in_natural_languages","223851437_Weighted_fuzzy_pattern_matching","223117057_General_multiple_objective_decision_making_and_linguistically_quantified_statements","222985159_Fuzzy_querying_with_SQL_Extensions_and_implementation_aspects","222801143_Fuzzy_measure_of_fuzzy_events_defined_by_fuzzy_integrals","222784232_An_interpretation_of_fuzzy_measures_and_the_Choquet_integral_as_an_integral_with_respect_to_a_fuzzy_measure","222597111_Fuzzy_cardinality_and_modeling_of_imprecise_quantification","220108397_A_General_Approach_to_Criteria_Aggregation_using_Fuzzy_Measures","220062106_A_two-layer_fuzzy_pattern_matching_procedure_for_the_evaluation_of_conditions_involving_vague_quantifiers","3335581_SQLF_a_relational_database_language_for_fuzzy_querying","3115417_Database_Queries_with_Fuzzy_Linguistic_Quantifiers","3113800_On_Ordered_Weighted_Averaging_Aggregation_Operators_in_Multicriteria_Decision_Making_IEEE_Transactions_on_Systems_Man_and_Cybernetics_8_1_183-190","2995339_Fuzzy_sets_Fuzzy_algebra_and_fuzzy_statistics"]}
