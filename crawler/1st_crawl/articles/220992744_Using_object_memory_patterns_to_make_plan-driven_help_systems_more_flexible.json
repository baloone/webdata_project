{"id":"220992744_Using_object_memory_patterns_to_make_plan-driven_help_systems_more_flexible","abstract":"Object memories support the creation of item-level records, which can be exploited for a deep analysis of processes a physical artefact is involved in. We believe that this technology has particular uses for conserving resources such as energy and water, and thus may provide a valuable contribution to an \"Internet for Resource Efficiency\". In this article, we discuss this idea on the basis of several application scenarios. We use these to identify research issues related to the application of object memories in this particular field in order to increase awareness of potential benefits and challenges and thus to stimulate research in this area.","authors":["Damien Cram","Alexander Kr√∂ner","Alain Mille"],"meta":["January 2009","DOI:10.3233/978-1-60750-056-8-45","SourceDBLP","Conference: Workshops Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Intelligent Environments, Barcelona, Spain, 19th of July, 2009"],"references":["312994459_Situation_recognition_Representation_and_algorithms","220816094_Situation_Recognition_Representation_and_Algorithms","225173032_Recomindation_New_Functions_for_Augmented_Memories","221516515_Enabling_nutrition-aware_cooking_in_a_smart_kitchen","200552850_Kitchen_stories_Sharing_recipes_with_the_Living_Cookbook","4317370_The_semantic_cookbook_Sharing_cooking_experiences_in_the_smart_kitchen"]}
