{"id":"276455918_Three-party_quantum_summation_without_a_trusted_third_party","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a quantum summation protocol, in which the genuinely maximally entangled six-qubit states found by Borras et al., are employed. Because of the excellent properties of the genuinely maximally entangled six-qubit states, the presented protocol allows three participants to compute the summation of their inputs without the help of a trusted third party and preserve the privacy of their inputs, respectively. The participants do not need any unitary operations. In addition, the proposed protocol utilizes the one-step quantum transmission and therefore is congenitally free from Trojan horse attacks. We have also shown that our protocol is secure against other well-known attacks over lossy and noisy quantum channels.","authors":["Cai Zhang","Zhiwei Sun","Xiang Huang","Dong-Yang Long"],"meta":["March 2015International Journal of Quantum Information 13(02):1550011","DOI:10.1142/S0219749915500112"],"references":["255825105_Trojan-horse_attacks_on_quantum-key-distribution_systems","235505477_Quantum_anonymous_voting_for_continuous_variables","234778924_How_to_play_ANY_mental_game","231006527_Multi-Qubit_Systems_Highly_Entangled_States_and_Entanglement_Distribution","222698860_On_a_problem_in_quantum_summation","51933082_Toward_protocols_for_quantum-ensured_privacy_and_secure_voting","13237765_Teleporting_an_unknown_quantum_state_via_dual_classical_and_Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen_channels","12332437_Simple_Proof_of_Security_of_the_BB84_Quantum_Key_Distribution_Protocol","11064282_Deterministic_Secure_Direct_Communication_Using_Entanglement","2204874_Quantum_Cryptography_with_Entangled_Photons","2203633_How_to_Share_a_Quantum_Secret","2202743_Unconditional_Security_Of_Quantum_Key_Distribution_Over_Arbitrarily_Long_Distances","2200098_Improving_the_security_of_secure_direct_communication_based_on_secret_transmitting_order_of_particles","2195292_Quantum_protocols_for_anonymous_voting_and_surveying","2194467_Quantum_Key_Distribution_Over_122_km_of_Standard_Telecom_Fiber","2191071_A_Two-Step_Quantum_Direct_Communication_Protocol_Using_Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen_Pair_Block","2188256_Practical_free-space_quantum_key_distribution_over_10_km_in_daylight_and_at_night","2187187_Entanglement_Swapping_of_Generalized_Cat_States_and_Secret_Sharing","293178577_Secure_multiparty_quantum_summation","265822730_Perfect_teleportation_between_arbitrary_split_of_six_partites_by_a_maximally_genuinely_entangled_six-qubit_state","263864244_Quantum_secure_direct_communication_with_quantum_identification","262214413_Communication_Locality_in_Secure_Multi-party_Computation_How_to_Run_Sublinear_Algorithms_in_a_Distributed_Setting","260456504_High-Capacity_Quantum_Summation_with_Single_Photons_in_Both_Polarization_and_Spatial-Mode_Degrees_of_Freedom","259228663_Quantum_entanglement_for_secret_sharing_and_secret_splitting","257641772_Improvements_on_multiparty_quantum_key_agreement_with_single_particles","257641689_Multiparty_quantum_key_agreement_with_single_particles","257572356_Quantum_Secure_Direct_Communication_with_Two-Photon_Four-Qubit_Cluster_States","257572298_High-Capacity_Quantum_Secure_Direct_Communication_with_Single_Photons_in_Both_Polarization_and_Spatial-Mode_Degrees_of_Freedom","257191430_Dynamic_quantum_secret_sharing","256818981_Quantum_key_agreement_protocol_based_on_BB84","241779175_Quantum_secret_sharing_of_multi-bits_by_an_entangled_six-qubit_state","235558264_Quantum_secure_direct_communication_with_ch-type_entangled_states","235532935_Quantum-Classical_Complexity-Security_Tradeoff_In_Secure_Multi-Party_Computation","230937114_Deterministic_secure_direct_communication_using_GHZ_states_and_swapping_quantum_entanglement","228109551_Quantum_secret_sharing","225809116_An_Efficient_Protocol_for_the_Secure_Multi-party_Quantum_Summation","222677258_Quantum_Summation_with_an_Application_to_Integration","222393678_Towards_quantum-based_privacy_and_voting","221664499_Non-Threshold_Quantum_Secret_Sharing_Schemes_in_the_Graph_StateFormalism","51963327_Continuous_Variable_Quantum_Key_Distribution_Finite-Key_Analysis_of_Composable_Security_against_Coherent_Attacks","48194637_Quantum_key_distribution_based_on_orthogonal_states_allows_securequantum_bit_commitment","13245023_Ekert_AK_Quantum_Cryptography_Based_on_Bell's_Theorem_Phys_Rev_Lett_676_661","13242964_Communication_via_one-_and_two-particle_operators_on_Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen_states","3387289_Quantum_key_agreement_protocol","2355676_Insecurity_of_Quantum_Secure_Computations"]}
