{"id":"290531749_Fault_tolerant_control_for_a_class_of_switched_linear_systems_using_generalized_switched_observer_scheme","abstract":"This paper concerns the design of a new active fault tolerant control framework for a class of switched linear systems subject to sensor faults and unknown bounded disturbances. The framework herein proposed ensures the fault tolerance capabilities by means of the interaction between three main blocks called generalized switched observer scheme, pre-designed multiple controllers and reconfiguration block. The fault detection and isolation problem has been solved by minimization of the H∞-norm and maximization of the H- index. Then, a suitable trade-off between the robustness to disturbances and the sensitivity to sensor faults has been obtained. The main results are reformulated by using linear matrix inequality formulation. An example is included to illustrate the design procedure.","authors":["D.E.C Belkhiat","Dalel Jabri","I.
