{"id":"275701095_Connecting_the_Dots","abstract":"Besides actually eavesdropping on specific conversations, The National Security Agency (NSA) have combed through large volumes of phone and Internet traffic in search for patterns that might point to terrorism suspects. This is quite a vague project, but the mathematical field of graph theory combined with social network might give a plausible guess on suspicious patterns by means of recording call graphs. Exploration of the call graph belongs to the branch of signal intelligence known as traffic analysis and for NSA's purpose, a communications pattern distinct to terrorism is being searched for. The tricky part of this network analysis is not finding the links but knowing which are significant and defining a pattern selective enough to identify a target group without branding others as possible terrorists.","authors":["Brian Hayes"],"meta":["September 2006American Scientist 94(5):400","DOI:10.1511/2006.61.3495"],"references":["242326403_The_Social_Organization_of_Conspiracy_Illegal_Networks_in_the_Heavy_Electrical_Equipment_Industry","2568360_Massive_Quasi-Clique_Detection","51992864_The_Strength_of_Weak_Ties"]}
