{"id":"270815031_'Use_the_active_voice_whenever_possible'_The_Impact_of_Style_Guidelines_in_Medical_Journals","abstract":"Medical writing is sometimes criticized for excessive use of the passive voice. The purpose of this study is twofold: (i)\nto provide quantitative descriptions of how the passive voice is used in medical journals and (ii) to assess the impact of\nstyle guidelines encouraging use of the active voice. From a corpus of 297 primary research articles published in the top\nfive medical journals, we extracted 19,691 passive constructions. Analyses show that guidelines have a significant effect\non use of the passive voice, and that this is highly localized in the ‘Methods’ and ‘Results’ sections. Analyses also identify\na core set of verbs which are strongly associated with the passive voice, and which play a central role in structuring the\ndiscourse. We argue that current guidelines influence author’s linguistic choices, and that although paraphrasing a sentence\nin the active voice may be possible, a passive alternative is sometimes preferable. Findings demonstrate the need for formative\nguidelines which better reflect the reality of conventionalized usage.","authors":["Neil Millar","Brian Budgell","Keith Fuller"],"meta":["September 2012Applied Linguistics 34(4):393-414","DOI:10.1093/applin/ams059"],"references":["265866892_Then_and_now_A_reconsideration_of_the_first_corpus_of_scientific_English","318494453_Metaphors_We_Live_By","303170745_Intra-textual_variation_within_medical_research_articles","277545876_Formulaic_language_in_native_speakers_Triangulating_psycholinguistics_corpus_linguistics_and_education","274178793_The_Processing_of_Malformed_Formulaic_Language","270150410_Genre_Analysis_English_in_Academic_and_Research_Settings","264655599_Formulaic_Language_in_Native_and_Second_Language_Speakers_Psycholinguistics_Corpus_Linguistics_and_TESOL","260404241_Use_of_the_Passive_voice_in_Medical_JoUrnal_articles","257273848_A_text-type_and_move_analysis_study_of_verb_tense_and_modality_distribution_in_medical_English_abstracts","256840396_How_to_Write_a_Paper"]}
