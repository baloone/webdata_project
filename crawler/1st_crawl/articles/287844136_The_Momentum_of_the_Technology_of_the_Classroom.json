{"id":"287844136_The_Momentum_of_the_Technology_of_the_Classroom","abstract":"This paper examines the viability of the concept of \"technological momentum\" from Thomas Hughes' Technological Systems Theory in the context of the adoption and use of online courses in post-secondary education. A case study approach using qualitative interviews is used to explore the \"technological momentum\" of the classroom as professors adopt the use of online courses. The findings provide specific examples of how previous classroom practice influences professors' attitudes and practice in relation to the adoption and use of online courses.","authors":["Scott Reid"],"meta":["January 2010","DOI:10.4018/978-1-61692-854-4.ch018"],"references":["286836380_Effects_of_Anonymity_and_Accountability_During_Online_Peer_Assessment","220374077_Cohort_Learning_Online_in_Graduate_Higher_Education_Constructing_Knowledge_in_Cyber_Community","47343024_Changing_roles_Comparing_face_to_face_and_on-line_teaching_in_the_light_of_new_technologies","28798511_An_Evaluation_of_IntelliMetric_Essay_Scoring_System","26386755_Emerging_Online_Learning_Environments_and_Student_Learning_An_Analysis_of_Faculty_Perceptions","289851048_Plagiarism_by_Adult_Learners_Online_A_case_study_in_detection_and_remediation","288926177_Directions_for_Research_and_Development_on_Electronic_Portfolios","279907795_Face-to-Face_Versus_Threaded_Discussions_The_Role_of_Time_and_Higher-Order_Thinking","279868129_Listen_to_the_Natives","279543009_Evaluating_online_discussions_Four_different_frames_of_analysis","268060229_Adapt_Adjust_Respond_Perspectives_on_Current_Trends_In_American_Colleges_and_Universities","265118154_Perspectives_on_the_Experience_of_the_Learning_Community_Through_Online_Discussions","255602378_The_impact_of_increasing_enrollment_on_faculty_workload_and_student_satisfaction_over_time","253022975_Re-Conceptualizing_Intimacy_and_Distance_in_Instructional_Models","246182977_5th_Generation_Distance_Education","242584812_MY_three_principles_of_effective_online_pedagogy","242490421_The_Evolution_of_Large_Technological_Systems","240273386_Teaching_courses_online_How_much_time_does_it_take","237628685_Do_They_Really_Think_Differently_Digital_Natives_Digital_Immigrants_Part_II","235233576_Electronics_and_the_Dim_Future_of_the_University","234646754_The_Handheld_Web_How_Mobile_Wireless_Technologies_Will_Change_Web-based_Instruction_and_Training","234021423_Grounded_Theory_Objectivist_and_Constructivist_Methods","228805699_University_instructors'_reflections_on_their_first_online_teaching_experiences","228728853_Why_Do_Educators_Embrace_High-Cost_Technologies","228345452_Teaching_online-A_time_comparison","226641993_Technology_Infusion_and_Higher_Education_Changing_Teaching_and_Learning","44838384_E-portfolios_An_assessment_tool_for_online_courses","28798528_Automated_Essay_Scoring_With_e-raterR_V2","26411634_Structure_Content_Delivery_Service_and_Outcomes_Quality_e-Learning_in_higher_education"]}
