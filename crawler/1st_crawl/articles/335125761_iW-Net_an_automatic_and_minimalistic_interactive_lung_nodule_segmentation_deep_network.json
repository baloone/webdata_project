{"id":"335125761_iW-Net_an_automatic_and_minimalistic_interactive_lung_nodule_segmentation_deep_network","abstract":"We propose iW-Net, a deep learning model that allows for both automatic and interactive segmentation of lung nodules in computed tomography images. iW-Net is composed of two blocks: the first one provides an automatic segmentation and the second one allows to correct it by analyzing 2 points introduced by the user in the nodule’s boundary. For this purpose, a physics inspired weight map that takes the user input into account is proposed, which is used both as a feature map and in the system’s loss function. Our approach is extensively evaluated on the public LIDC-IDRI dataset, where we achieve a state-of-the-art performance of 0.55 intersection over union vs the 0.59 inter-observer agreement. Also, we show that iW-Net allows to correct the segmentation of small nodules, essential for proper patient referral decision, as well as improve the segmentation of the challenging non-solid nodules and thus may be an important tool for increasing the early diagnosis of lung cancer.","authors":["Guilherme Aresta","Colin Jacobs","Teresa Araújo","António Cunha"],"meta":["August 2019Scientific Reports 9(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-019-48004-8"],"references":["320344644_Interactive_Medical_Image_Segmentation_Using_Deep_Learning_With_Image-Specific_Fine_Tuning","318063654_Central_Focused_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_Developing_a_Data-driven_Model_for_Lung_Nodule_Segmentation","314102988_Guidelines_for_Management_of_Incidental_Pulmonary_Nodules_Detected_on_CT_Images_From_the_Fleischner_Society_2017","325522391_Joint_learning_for_pulmonary_nodule_segmentation_attributes_and_malignancy_prediction","322257103_Cancer_statistics_2018","313178942_Reduced_lung-cancer_mortality_with_low-dose_computed_tomographic_screening","313072707_3D_U-Net_Learning_Dense_Volumetric_Segmentation_from_Sparse_Annotation","311900928_Validation_comparison_and_combination_of_algorithms_for_automatic_detection_of_pulmonary_nodules_in_computed_tomography_images_The_LUNA16_challenge","304781977_Algorithms_for_hyper-parameter_optimization","303095474_Hessian_based_approaches_for_3D_lung_nodule_segmentation"]}
