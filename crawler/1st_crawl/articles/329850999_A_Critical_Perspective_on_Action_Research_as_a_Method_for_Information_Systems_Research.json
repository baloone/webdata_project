{"id":"329850999_A_Critical_Perspective_on_Action_Research_as_a_Method_for_Information_Systems_Research","abstract":"This paper reviews the origins, techniques and roles associated with action research into information systems (IS). Many consider the approach to be the paragon of post-positivist research methods, yet it has a cloudy history among the social sciences. The paper summarizes the rigorous approach to action research and suggests certain domains of ideal use (such as systems development methodology). For those faced with conducting, reviewing or examining action research, the paper discusses various problems, opportunities and strategies.","authors":["Richard L.
