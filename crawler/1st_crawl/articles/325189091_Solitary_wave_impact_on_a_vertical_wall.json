{"id":"325189091_Solitary_wave_impact_on_a_vertical_wall","abstract":"Wave impact on a vertical wall has been investigated in a physical and numerical wave tank. Two different impact phenomena were explored. A flip-through, where the front face of the wave was moving rapidly vertical due to a jet and a case with a very steep wave were generated in a wave tank. In the latter, the front was almost vertical and the measured pressure at impact was 60% higher than the flip-through event.\nBoth kinematics and pressures were measured and compared with numerical simulations. Similar features were seen in both experiments and simulations. Maximum pressure is found when a vertical front is violently impacting on a vertical wall. A pronounced double pressure peak is observed in the pressure measurements due to the impact and rundown process.","authors":["Atle Jensen"],"meta":["May 2018European Journal of Mechanics - B/Fluids 73","DOI:10.1016/j.euromechflu.2018.05.004"],"references":["301553535_Breaking_Solitary_Waves_and_Breaking_Wave_Forces_on_a_Vertically_Mounted_Slender_Cylinder_over_an_Impermeable_Sloping_Seabed","245219650_Breaking_wave_loads_at_vertical_seawalls_and_breakwaters","311166854_Investigation_of_breaking_and_non-breaking_solitary_waves_and_measurements_of_swash_zone_dynamics_on_a_5_beach","259092918_Plunging_solitary_wave_and_its_interaction_with_a_slender_cylinder_on_a_sloping_beach","257281940_Some_aspects_of_the_flip-through_phenomenon_A_numerical_study_based_on_the_desingularized_technique","257211054_The_influence_of_air_on_the_impact_of_a_plunging_breaking_wave_on_a_vertical_wall_using_a_multifluid_model","245218411_Wave_impact_pressure_on_vertical_walls_under_breaking_waves_of_various_types","223943486_Violent_breaking_wave_impacts_Part_1_Results_from_large-scale_regular_wave_tests_on_vertical_and_sloping_walls"]}
