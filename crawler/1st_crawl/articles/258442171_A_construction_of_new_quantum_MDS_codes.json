{"id":"258442171_A_construction_of_new_quantum_MDS_codes","abstract":"It has been a great challenge to construct new quantum MDS codes. In\nparticular, it is very hard to construct quantum MDS codes with relatively\nlarge minimum distance. So far, except for some sparse lengths, all known\n$q$-ary quantum MDS codes have minimum distance less than or equal to $q/2+1$.\nIn the present paper, we provide a construction of quantum MDS codes with\nminimum distance bigger than $q/2+1$. In particular, we show existence of\n$q$-ary quantum MDS codes with length $n=q^2+1$ and minimum distance $d$ for\nany $d\\le q+1$ (this result extends those given in \\cite{Gu11,Jin1,KZ12}); and\nwith length $(q^2+2)/3$ and minimum distance $d$ for any $d\\le (2q+2)/3$ if\n$3|(q+1)$. Our method is through Hermitian self-orthogonal codes. The main idea\nof constructing Hermitian self-orthogonal codes is based on the solvability in\n$\\F_q$ of a system of homogenous equations over $\\F_{q^2}$.","authors":["Lingfei Jin","Chaoping Xing"],"meta":["November 2013IEEE Transactions on Information Theory 60(5)","DOI:10.1109/TIT.2014.2299800","SourcearXiv"],"references":["224168139_Application_of_Classical_Hermitian_Self-Orthogonal_MDS_Codes_to_Quantum_MDS_Codes","277161463_Quantum_generalized_Reed-Solomon_codes_Unified_framework_for_quantum_MDS_codes","267166888_Measure_theory_A_first_course","260542013_New_Quantum_MDS_Codes_From_Negacyclic_Codes","252687442_Construction_of_nn-43q_quantum_codes_for_odd_prime_power_q","246356736_Quantum_Error_Correction_Via_Codes_Over","235600211_Quantum_generalized_Reed-Solomon_codes_Unified_framework_for_quantum_maximum-distance-separable_codes","224754158_On_quantum_MDS_codes","224621541_Nonbinary_quantum_Reed-Muller_codes","224249286_New_quantum_MDS_codes"]}
