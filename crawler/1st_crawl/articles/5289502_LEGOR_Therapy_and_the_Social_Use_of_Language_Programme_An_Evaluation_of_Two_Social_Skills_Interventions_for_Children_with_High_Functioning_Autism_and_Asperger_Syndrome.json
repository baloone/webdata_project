Children were matched on CA, IQ, and autistic symptoms before being randomly assigned to LEGO or SULP. Therapy occurred for 1 h/week over 18 weeks. A no-intervention control group was also assessed. Results showed that the LEGO therapy group improved more than the other groups on autism-specific social interaction scores (Gilliam Autism Rating Scale). Maladaptive behaviour decreased significantly more in the LEGO and SULP groups compared to the control group. There was a non-significant trend for SULP and LEGO groups to improve more than the no-intervention group in communication and socialisation skills.","authors":["Gina Owens","Yael E Granader","Ayla Humphrey","Simon Baron-Cohen"],"meta":["July 2008Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders 38(10):1944-57","DOI:10.1007/s10803-008-0590-6","SourcePubMed"],"references":["283921846_Systemizing_empathy_Teaching_adults_with_asperger_syndrome_and_high_functioning_autism_to_recognize_complex_emotions_using_interactive_multimedia","250169863_Increasing_the_Social_Behavior_of_Young_Children_With_Autism_Using_Their_Obsessive_Behaviors","247784563_The_Use_of_Social_Stories_as_a_Preventative_Behavioral_Intervention_in_a_Home_Setting_with_a_Child_with_Autism","313714608_The_vineland_adaptive_behavior_scales","313639023_'Autism_Diagnosis_Interview-Revised_A_Revised_Version_of_a_Diagnostic_Interview_for_Caregivers_of_Individuals_with_Possible_Pervasive_Developmental_Disorder'","313185880_Conners'_Rating_Scales-Revised","289205137_Vineland_Adaptive_Behavior_Scales","263540864_Asperger's_Syndrome_A_Guide_for_Parents_and_Professionals","255684869_Asperger_Syndrome_or_High-Functioning_Autism","247785165_The_Effects_of_Social_Stories_on_the_Social_Engagement_of_Children_with_Autism"]}
