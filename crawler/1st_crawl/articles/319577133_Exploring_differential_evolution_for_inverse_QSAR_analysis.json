{"id":"319577133_Exploring_differential_evolution_for_inverse_QSAR_analysis","abstract":"Inverse quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling encompasses the generation of compound structures from values of descriptors corresponding to high activity predicted with a given QSAR model. Structure generation proceeds from descriptor coordinates optimized for activity prediction. Herein, we concentrate on the first phase of the inverse QSAR process and introduce a new methodology for coordinate optimization, termed differential evolution (DE), that originated from computer science and engineering. Using simulation and compound activity data, we demonstrate that DE in combination with support vector regression (SVR) yields effective and robust predictions of optimized coordinates satisfying model constraints and requirements. For different compound activity classes, optimized coordinates are obtained that exclusively map to regions of high activity in feature space, represent novel positions for structure generation, and are chemically meaningful.","authors":["Tomoyuki Miyao","Kimito Funatsu","JÃ¼rgen Bajorath"],"meta":["September 2017F1000 Research 6:1285","DOI:10.12688/f1000research.12228.2"],"references":["313681104_Fragment-based_in_silico_modeling_of_multi-target_inhibitors_against_breast_cancer-related_proteins","308980727_Automatic_Chemical_Design_Using_a_Data-Driven_Continuous_Representation_of_Molecules","303949763_Ring_system-based_chemical_graph_generation_for_de_novo_molecular_design","271881485_Performance_Comparison_of_Differential_Evolution_and_Particle_Swarm_Optimization_in_Constrained_Optimization","258431578_The_ChEMBL_bioactivity_database_an_update","316450629_Speeding_up_Early_Drug_Discovery_in_Antiviral_Research_A_Fragment-Based_in_Silico_Approach_for_the_Design_of_Virtual_Anti-Hepatitis_C_Leads","292154162_Inverse_QSPRQSAR_Analysis_for_Chemical_Structure_Generation_from_y_to_x","277690945_De_Novo_Design_From_Models_to_Molecules","269287594_Ring-system-based_exhaustive_structure_generation_for_inverse-QSPRQSAR","257896188_A_comparative_study_of_differential_evolution_and_genetic_algorithms_for_optimizing_the_design_of_water_distribution_systems"]}
