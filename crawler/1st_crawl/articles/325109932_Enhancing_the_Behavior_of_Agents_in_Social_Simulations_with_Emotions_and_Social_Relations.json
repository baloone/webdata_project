{"id":"325109932_Enhancing_the_Behavior_of_Agents_in_Social_Simulations_with_Emotions_and_Social_Relations","abstract":"Social Simulations need agents with a realistic behavior to be used as a scientific tool by social scientists. When simulating a human society, a realistic behavior implies the use of cognition, social relations between people but also to take into account emotions and the dynamic between these features. However, developing such a behavior is often too complex for people with little knowledge in programming. In this paper, we present a formalism to represent cognition, social relations and emotions, which is integrated in an agent architecture to give a dynamic emotional behavior to social agents. This architecture is implemented in the open-source multi-agent platform GAMA. A use case about evacuation during bush fires in Australia is used to show the possibilities of our work.","authors":["Mathieu Bourgais","Patrick Taillandier","Laurent Vercouter"],"meta":["May 2018","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-91587-6_7","In book: Multi-Agent Based Simulation XVIII (pp.89-104)","Project: ACTEUR"],"references":["320123802_A_BDI_Agent_Architecture_for_the_GAMA_Modeling_and_Simulation_Platform","309760618_Comparing_Agent_Architectures_in_Social_Simulation_BDI_Agents_versus_Finite-state_Machines","309726073_A_BDI_agent_architecture_for_the_GAMA_modeling_and_simulation_platform","306074863_BDI_agents_in_social_simulations_a_survey","287362915_OpenSim_A_framework_for_integrating_agent-based_models_and_simulation_components","344710431_Getting_Acquainted_in_Conversation_A_study_of_initial_interactions","325489992_Politeness_Some_Universals_in_Language_Usage","304293873_An_overview_of_simulation_software_for_non-experts_to_perform_multi-robot_experiments","292581915_Cognition_and_multi-agent_interaction_From_cognitive_modeling_to_social_simulation","288625654_The_Role_of_Emotions_in_Multiagent_Teamwork"]}
