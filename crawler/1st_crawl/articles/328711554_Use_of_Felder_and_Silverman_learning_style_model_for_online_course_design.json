{"id":"328711554_Use_of_Felder_and_Silverman_learning_style_model_for_online_course_design","abstract":"Learning Management Systems are used in millions of higher education courses, across various countries and disciplines. Teachers build courses reflecting their individual teaching methods, which may not always fit students’ different learning styles. However, limited information is known about how well these courses support the learners. The study aims to explore the use of Felder and Silverman learning style for online course design. The study has used linear transfer function system models to develop fundamentals of feedback by a course analyzer tool. This interactive tool allows teachers to determine a course’s support level for specific learning styles, based on the Felder and Silverman learning style model. The Felder and Silverman learning style model in this study is used to visualize the fit between course and learning style to help teachers improve their course’s support for diverse learning styles. The results of a pilot study successfully validated the course analyzer tool, as it has potential to improve the design of the course in future and allow more insight into overall student performance. The findings suggest that a course designed with certain learning styles in mind can improve learning of the students with those specific learning styles.","authors":["Moushir M.
