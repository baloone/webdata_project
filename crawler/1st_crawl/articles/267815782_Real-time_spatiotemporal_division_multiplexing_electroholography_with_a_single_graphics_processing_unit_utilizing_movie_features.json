{"id":"267815782_Real-time_spatiotemporal_division_multiplexing_electroholography_with_a_single_graphics_processing_unit_utilizing_movie_features","abstract":"We propose a real-time spatiotemporal division multiplexing electroholography utilizing the features of movies. The proposed method spatially divides a 3-D object into plural parts and periodically selects a divided part in each frame, thereby reconstructing a three-dimensional (3-D) movie of the original object. Computer-generated holograms of the selected part are calculated by a single graphics processing unit and sequentially displayed on a spatial light modulator. Visual continuity enables a reconstructed movie of the original 3-D object. The proposed method realized a real-time reconstructed movie of a 3-D object composed of 11,646 points at over 30 frames per second (fps). We also displayed a reconstructed movie of a 3-D object composed of 44,647 points at about 10 fps.","authors":["Hiroaki Niwase","Naoki Takada","Hiromitsu Araki","Hirotaka Nakayama"],"meta":["November 2014Optics Express 22(23)","DOI:10.1364/OE.22.028052"],"references":["265019833_Large_size_three-dimensional_video_by_electronic_holography_using_multiple_spatial_light_modulators","260152709_Minimized_speckle_noise_in_lens-less_holographic_display_by_pixel_separation","233975822_Wide_angle_holographic_display_system_with_spatiotemporal_multiplexing","51060781_Speckle-free_and_grayscale_hologram_reconstruction_using_time-multiplexing_technique","23973048_Speckle_elimination_using_shift-averaging_in_high-rate_holographic_display","2783508_Electronic_Display_System_for_Computational_Holography","2766592_Interactive_Computation_of_Holograms_Using_a_Look-Up_Table","257301289_Fast_distributed_large-pixel-count_hologram_computation_using_a_GPU_cluster","245405207_Interactive_color_electroholography_using_the_FPGA_technology_and_time_division_switching_method","232610356_Fast_high-resolution_computer-generated_hologram_computation_using_multiple_graphics_processing_unit_cluster_system","232086810_Real-time_capture_and_reconstruction_system_with_multiple_GPUs_for_a_3D_live_scene_by_a_generation_from_4K_IP_images_to_8K_holograms","231038600_An_electroholographic_colour_reconstruction_by_time_division_switching_of_reference_lights","227165200_A_Color_Holographic_Reconstruction_System_by_Time_Division_Multiplexing_with_Reference_Lights_of_Laser","224143015_Wide-Angle_Wavefront_Reconstruction_Near_Display_Plane_in_Three-Dimensional_Display_System","221895834_Generation_of_real-time_large_computer_generated_hologram_using_wavefront_recording_method","51658706_Holographic_video_at_40_frames_per_second_for_4-million_object_points","51455004_Time-division_color_electroholography_using_one-chip_RGB_LED_and_synchronizing_controller","40443383_Real-time_phase-only_color_holographic_video_display_system_using_LED_illumination","38019397_Simple_and_fast_calculation_algorithm_for_computer-generated_hologram_with_wavefront_recording_plane","26783969_Simplified_electroholographic_color_reconstruction_system_using_graphics_processing_unit_and_liquid_crystal_display_projector","26273295_Computer_generated_holography_using_a_graphics_processing_unit"]}
