{"id":"333913153_Static_data_structure_lower_bounds_imply_rigidity","abstract":"We show that static data structure lower bounds in the group (linear) model imply semi-explicit lower bounds on matrix rigidity. In particular, we prove that an explicit lower bound of t ≥ ω(log²n) on the cell-probe complexity of linear data structures in the group model, even against arbitrarily small linear space (s= (1+)n), would already imply a semi-explicit (PNP) construction of rigid matrices with significantly better parameters than the current state of art (Alon, Panigrahy and Yekhanin, 2009). Our results further assert that polynomial (t≥ nδ) data structure lower bounds against near-optimal space, would imply super-linear circuit lower bounds for log-depth linear circuits (a four-decade open question). In the succinct space regime (s=n+o(n)), we show that any improvement on current cell-probe lower bounds in the linear model would also imply new rigidity bounds. Our results rely on a new connection between the “inner” and “outer” dimensions of a matrix (Paturi and Pudlák, 2006), and on a new reduction from worst-case to average-case rigidity, which is of independent interest.","authors":["Zeev Dvir","Alexander Golovnev","Omri Weinstein"],"meta":["June 2019","DOI:10.1145/3313276.3316348","Conference: the 51st Annual ACM SIGACT Symposium"],"references":["307619227_Matrix_rigidity_of_random_Toeplitz_matrices","220616528_Locally_Decodable_Codes_with_Two_Queries_and_Polynomial_Identity_Testing_for_Depth_3_Circuits","220574270_On_Data_Structures_and_Asymmetric_Communication_Complexity","220365642_Complexity_Lower_Bounds_using_Linear_Algebra","45916129_Min-Rank_Conjecture_for_Log-Depth_Circuits","45915540_Lower_Bounds_on_Near_Neighbor_Search_via_Metric_Expansion","2839874_Lower_Bounds_for_Linear_Locally_Decodable_Codes_and_Private_Information_Retrieval","2817053_Geometric_Range_Searching_and_Its_Relatives","337608649_Fast_polynomial_factorization_and_modular_composition","321500794_Introduction_to_Coding_Theory_and_Algebraic_Geometry","316792407_Introduction_to_Coding_Theory","295686406_On_Data_Structures_and_Asymmetric_Communication_Complexity","273130028_The_Theory_of_Error-Correcting_Codes","268884731_Schwestern_oder_Rivalinnen","262395215_Succinct_sampling_from_discrete_distributions","261267741_Higher_Cell_Probe_Lower_Bounds_for_Evaluating_Polynomials","256623712_On_sparse_graphs_with_dense_long_paths","242306588_Boolean_Function_Complexity_Advances_and_Frontiers","230672307_Adapt_or_Die_Polynomial_Lower_Bounds_for_Non-Adaptive_Dynamic_DataStructures","228057915_Machine_Models_and_Simulations","225715495_Circuit_lower_bounds_and_linear_codes","222783959_Some_combinatorial-algebraic_problems_from_complexity_theory","222700485_Randomness_vs_Time_Derandomization_under_a_Uniform_Assumption","222488123_A_remark_on_matrix_rigidity","221591128_On_Data_Structures_and_Asymmetric_Communication_Complexity","221590474_Lower_bounds_for_2-dimensional_range_counting","221580515_On_Matrix_Rigidity_and_Locally_Self-Correctable_Codes","221499333_On_Range_Searching_in_the_Group_Model_and_Combinatorial_Discrepancy","221462778_Deterministic_Approximation_Algorithms_for_the_Nearest_Codeword_Problem","220975753_Graph-Theoretic_Arguments_in_Low-Level_Complexity","220693968_Computational_Complexity_A_Modern_Approach","220618377_On_Universal_Classes_of_Extremely_Random_Constant-Time_Hash_Functions","220467864_On_Matrix_Rigidity_and_Locally_Self-correctable_Codes","220442096_A_note_on_matrix_rigidity","220432323_Should_Tables_Be_Sorted","220431179_A_Lower_Bound_on_the_Complexity_of_Orthogonal_Range_Queries","220430489_Lower_Bounds_for_Orthogonal_Range_Searching_II_The_Arithmetic_Model","220138283_Noisy_Interpolation_of_Sparse_Polynomials_and_Applications","220138181_On_a_Theorem_of_Razborov","47451616_Unifying_the_Landscape_of_Cell-Probe_Lower_Bounds","30816210_Fast_Polynomial_Factorization_and_Modular_Composition","30815322_The_Cell_Probe_Complexity_of_Succinct_Data_Structures","2439879_The_Bit_Probe_Complexity_Measure_Revisited"]}
