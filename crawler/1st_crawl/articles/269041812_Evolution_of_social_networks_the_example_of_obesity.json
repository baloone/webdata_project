{"id":"269041812_Evolution_of_social_networks_the_example_of_obesity","abstract":"The present paper deals with the effect of the social transmission of nutrition habits in a social and biological age-dependent context on obesity, and accordingly on type II diabetes and among its complications, the neurodegenerative diseases. The evolution of social networks and inside a network the healthy weight of a person are depending on the context in which this person has contacts and exchanges concerning his alimentation, physical activity and sedentary habits, inside the dominant social network in which the person lives (e.g., scholar for young, professional for adult, home or institution for elderly people). Three successive steps of evolution will be considered for social networks (like for neural oneâ€™s): initial random connectivity, destruction and consolidation of links following a new transition rule called homophilic until an asymptotic architectural organization and configuration of states. The application of such a network dynamics concerns the sequence overweight/obesity/type II diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases.","authors":["Jacques Demongeot","Carla Taramasco"],"meta":["December 2014Biogerontology 15(6)","DOI:10.1007/s10522-014-9542-z"],"references":["313609388_On_the_evolution_of_random_graphs","313105216_Two_new_loci_for_body-weight_regulation_identified_in_a_joint_analysis_of_genome-wide_association_studies_for_early-onset_extreme_obesity_in_French_and_German_study_groups","299956497_Random_Fields_And_Spatial_Renewal_Potentials","292743362_Obesity_stigmatization_and_coping_relation_to_mental_health_symptoms_body_image_and_self-esteem","291257375_Serious_Game_as_New_Health_Telematics_Tool_for_Patient_Therapy_Education_Example_of_Obesity_and_Type_2_Diabetes","285312293_La_dependance_des_personnes_agees_Une_projection_en_2040","284666056_Epidemiology_of_Alzheimer's_disease","273354153_The_Spread_of_Obesity_in_a_Large_Social_Network_Over_32_Years","268529386_Glycolytic_Oscillations_An_Attempt_to_an_In_Vitro_Reconstitution_of_the_Higher_Part_of_Glycolysis_Modelling_and_Experimental_Approach","267058113_Robustness_in_biological_regulatory_networks_IV_Application_to_genetic_networks_controlling_the_cell_cycle"]}
