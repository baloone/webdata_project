{"id":"309670606_A_review_paper_Student_attitude_towards_computer_science","abstract":"The present review study is an attempt to examine the vast literature on student attitude towards computer science. Its main focus is to explore the introduction of student’s attitude towards computer science. Hence,content analysis was performed and important measures vi.objectives,sources of data,major variables,research methodology,and significant findings have been reported. The study underlined the students’ attitude towards computer science career. Learning difficulties in introductory programming courses are well known to teachers and students. While some types of causes for those complications can be pointed out. In this work we concentrated on student related issues,namely their study methods and attitudes towards learning programs. This study is surely going to help the young researchers who do research in student attitude towards computer science to make a tough theoretical structure through analyzing the descriptive studies from 1997-2015. © 2016,International Journal of Pharmacy and Technology.
