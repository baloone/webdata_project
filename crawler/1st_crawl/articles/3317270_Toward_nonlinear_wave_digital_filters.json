{"id":"3317270_Toward_nonlinear_wave_digital_filters","abstract":"The wave digital filter (WDF) theory provides us with a systematic\nmethodology for building digital models of analog filters through the\ndiscretization of their individual circuit components. In some\nsituations, WDF principles can also be successfully used for modeling\ncircuits in which a nonlinear circuit element is present under mild\nconditions on its characteristic. We propose an extension of the classic\nWDF principles, which allows us to considerably extend the class of\nnonlinear elements that can be modeled in the wave digital domain. The\nmethod we propose is based on a new class of waves that can be chosen in\nsuch a may that incorporates the intrinsic dynamics of a nonlinear\nelement into a new class of dynamic multiport adaptors. This family of\njunctions represents a generalization of the concept of\n“mutator” in the analog nonlinear circuit theory because it\nallows us to treat a nonlinear dynamic element as if it were\ninstantaneous (resistive)","authors":["Augusto Sarti","Giovanni De Poli"],"meta":["July 1999IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing 47(6):1654 - 1668","DOI:10.1109/78.765137","SourceIEEE Xplore","Project: Sound Modeling"],"references":["339913921_Sound_Synthesis_by_Dynamic_System_Interaction","228959490_Generalized_adaptors_with_memory_for_nonlinear_wave_digital_structures","224722800_Digital_simulation_of_nonlinear_circuits_by_wave_digital_filter_principles","312459128_Memristor_-_The_missing_circuit_element","279010958_CHUAS_CIRCUIT_FAMILY","252992264_Period_Doubling_and_Chaotic_Behavior_in_a_Driven_Anharmonic_Oscillator","248157170_Traveling_Wave_Implementation_of_A_Losseles_Mode-Coupling_Filter_and_The_Wave_Digital_Hammer","245254328_Algorithms_and_Structures_for_Synthesis_Using_Physical_Models","243470248_Evidence_for_Universal_Chaotic_Behavior_of_a_Driven_Nonlinear_Oscillator","242655735_Classical_Network_Theory","239457831_Chua''s_Circuit_A_Paredigm_for_Chaos","239365488_Acoustic_Modeling_Using_Digital_Waveguides","229714093_Wave_digital_filters_with_reduced_number_of_delays","229706804_Reciprocity_inter-reciprocity_and_transposition_in_wave_digital_filters","224043915_Chua's_Circuit_A_Paradigm_for_Chaos","224043751_Nonlinear_Oscillators_in_Physical_Systems","3642067_A_new_wave_description_for_nonlinear_elements","3440184_Pseudo-passivity_sensitivity_and_stability_of_wave_digital_filters","3439950_Chua_LO_Memristor-the_missing_circuit_element_IEEE_Trans_Circuit_Theory_185_507-519","3439890_Some_Principles_of_Designing_Digital_Filters_Imitating_Classical_Filter_Structures","3322473_Simulation_of_Nonlinear_Circuits_with_Period_Doubling_and_Chaotic_Behavior_by_Wave_Digital_Filter_Principles","3186021_Nonlinear_circuits","3186019_Digital_Circuits_and_Systems","3185423_Device_Modeling_Via_Basic_Nonlinear_Circuit_Elements","3185421_Dynamic_Nonlinear_Networks_State-of-the-Art","3184698_Suppression_of_Parasitic_Oscillations_in_Wave_Digital_Filters","3176156_On_Adaptors_for_Wave_Digital_Filters","2997767_Chua's_Circuit_Family","2997445_Wave_digital_filters_Theory_and_practice","2991043_Synthesis_of_new_nonlinear_network_elements_Proc_IEEE_568_1325-1340"]}
