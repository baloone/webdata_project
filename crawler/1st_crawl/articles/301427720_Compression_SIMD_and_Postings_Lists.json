{"id":"301427720_Compression_SIMD_and_Postings_Lists","abstract":"The three generations of postings list compression strategies (Variable Byte Encoding, Word Aligned Codes, and SIMD Codecs) are examined in order to test whether or not each truly represented a generational change -- they do. Some weaknesses of the current SIMD-based schemes are identified and a new scheme, QMX, is introduced to address both space and decoding inefficiencies. Improvements are examined on multiple architectures and it is shown that different SSE implementations (Intel and AMD) perform differently.","authors":["Andrew Trotman"],"meta":["November 2014","DOI:10.1145/2682862.2682870","Conference: the 2014 Australasian Document Computing Symposium"],"references":["232252646_Decoding_billions_of_integers_per_second_through_vectorization","225259292_Compressing_Inverted_Files","221613797_VSEncoding_Efficient_Coding_and_Fast_Decoding_of_Integer_Lists_via_Dynamic_Programming","221613419_SIMD-based_decoding_of_posting_lists","221301093_Compression_of_Inverted_Indexes_For_Fast_Query_Evaluation","4234735_Super-scalar_RAM-CPU_cache_compression","267155849_Towards_an_Efficient_and_Effective_Search_Engine","225246528_Binary_Interpolative_Coding_for_Effective_Index_Compression","221520010_Challenges_in_building_large-scale_information_retrieval_systems_Invited_talk","221022348_Performance_of_compressed_inverted_list_caching_in_search_engines","220479917_Inverted_Index_Compression_Using_Word-Aligned_Binary_Codes","220281825_Index_compression_using_64-bit_words","3082524_Universal_Codeword_Sets_and_Representations_of_the_Integers","3081103_Run-Length_Encodings","2523092_Compressing_Integers_for_Fast_File_Access"]}
