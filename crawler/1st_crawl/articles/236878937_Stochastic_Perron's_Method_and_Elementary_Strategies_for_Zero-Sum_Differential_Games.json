{"id":"236878937_Stochastic_Perron's_Method_and_Elementary_Strategies_for_Zero-Sum_Differential_Games","abstract":"We develop here the Stochastic Perron Method in the framework of two-player\nzero-sum differential games. We consider the formulation of the game where both\nplayers play, symmetrically, feed-back strategies (as in [CR09] or [PZ12]) as\nopposed to the Elliott-Kalton formulation prevalent in the literature (like\n[EK72] or [FS89]). The class of feed-back strategies we use is carefully chosen\nso that the state equation admits strong solutions and the technicalities\ninvolved in the Stochastic Perron Method carry through in a rather simple way.\nMore precisely, we define the game over elementary strategies, which are well\nmotivated by intuition. Within this framework, the Stochastic Perron Method\nproduces a viscosity sub-solution of the upper Isaacs equation dominating the\nupper value of the game, and a viscosity super-solution of the upper Isaacs\nequation lying below the upper value of the game. Using a viscosity comparison\nresult we obtain that the upper value is the unique and continuous viscosity\nsolution of the upper Isaacs equation. An identical statement holds for the\nlower value and lower Isaacs equation. A version of the Dynamic Programming\nPrinciple is obtained as a by-product. If the Isaacs condition holds, the game\nhas a value over elementary (pure) strategies.","authors":["Mihai SÃ®rbu"],"meta":["May 2013SIAM Journal on Control and Optimization 52(3)","DOI:10.1137/130929965","SourcearXiv"],"references":["253935896_Values_in_differential_games","234816122_A_representation_formula_and_regularizing_properties_for_viscosity_solutions_of_second-order_fully_nonlinear_degenerate_parabolic_equations","233866272_Stochastic_Perron's_Method_for_Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman_Equations","51966813_Stochastic_Perron's_method_and_verification_without_smoothness_using_viscosity_comparison_Obstacle_problems_and_Dynkin_games","50235697_Stochastic_Perron's_method_and_verification_without_smoothness_using_viscosity_comparison_The_linear_case","2137300_User's_Guide_to_Viscosity_Solutions_of_Second_Order_Artial_Differential_Equations","2136357_Stochastic_Differential_Games_with_Asymmetric_Information","2135458_Stochastic_Differential_Games_and_Viscosity_Solutions_ofHamilton-Jacobi-Bellman-Isaacs_Equations","313060456_User's_guide_to_viscosity_solutions_of_second_order_partial_differential_equations","292171788_DIFFERENTIAL_GAMES_OPTIMAL_CONTROL_AND_DIRECTIONAL_DERIVATIVES_OF_VISCOSITY_SOLUTIONS_OF_BELLMAN'S_AND_ISAACS'_EQUATIONS","268990782_On_the_theory_of_controlled_diffusion_processes","263536660_Sub-_and_superoptimality_principles_of_dynamic_programming_revisited","251219329_Some_elements_of_stochastic_analysis","249964149_On_Martingale_Problems_with_Continuous-Time_Mixing_and_Values_of_Zero-Sum_Games_without_the_Isaacs_Condition","248336793_Viscosity_solutions_of_fully_non-linear_second-order_partial_differential_equations","243785789_On_the_Existence_of_Value_Functions_of_Two-Player_Zero-Sum_Stochastic_Differential_Games","243092879_Differential_Games_Optimal_Control_and_Directional_Derivatives_of_Viscosity_Solutions_of_Bellman's_and_Isaacs'_Equations","231337816_Two_Person_Zero-Sum_Game_in_Weak_Formulation_and_Path_Dependent_Bellman--Isaacs_Equation","230873295_Continuous-Time_Stochastic_Control_and_Optimization_with_Financial_Applications","227423406_BSDEs_and_Risk-Sensitive_Control_Zero-Sum_and_Nonzero-Sum_Game_Problems_of_Stochastic_Functional_Differential_Equations","224872290_On_the_dynamic_programming_principle_for_uniformly_nondegeneratestochastic_differential_games_in_domains_and_the_Isaacs_equations","223931633_Another_Approach_to_the_Existence_of_Value_Functions_of_Stochastic_Differential_Games","222228218_Zero-Sum_Stochastic_Differential_Games_and_Backward_Equations","50218308_Parabolic_comparison_revisited_and_applications","38353086_Stochastic_Differential_Games_and_Viscosity_Solutions_of_Isaacs_Equations","38351272_The_Controller-and-Stopper_Game_for_a_Linear_Diffusion","38333503_Perron's_method_for_Hamilton-Jacobi_equations"]}
