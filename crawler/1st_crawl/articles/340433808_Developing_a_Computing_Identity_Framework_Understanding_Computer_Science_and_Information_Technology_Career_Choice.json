{"id":"340433808_Developing_a_Computing_Identity_Framework_Understanding_Computer_Science_and_Information_Technology_Career_Choice","abstract":"This paper expands on knowledge of computing identity by building on what is known about prior identity models in science and mathematics education. The model theorizes three primary sub-constructs that contribute to the development of a computing identity: belief in one's performance/competence, interest, and recognition in computing. Drawing on data from a nationally representative survey of more than 1,700 college students at 22 colleges and universities, the study tested the alignment of the theorized model to the measures on the survey. Confirmatory Factor Analysis was used to validate whether the appropriate measures loaded on the three separate sub-constructs. Criterion-related validity was also established by testing whether the computing identity measures predicted the choice of a computer science career. The results reveal that a computing identity proxy based on the theorized measures was a highly significant predictor of students' computer science and information technology career choice (p < 0.0001). In addition, this work also established criterion-related validity by showing gender differences that had been found by prior work in computing. Finally, the theorized measures were found to be reliable and internally consistent. The educational understanding of computing identities may provide an important tool to help researchers and practitioners improve student persistence in computer science.","authors":["Jonathan Mahadeo","Zahra Hazari","Geoff Potvin"],"meta":["February 2020ACM Transactions on Computing Education 20(1):1-14","DOI:10.1145/3365571"],"references":["283805905_Assessing_Structural_Equation_Models_by_Equivalence_Testing_With_Adjusted_Fit_Indexes","281345525_Motivational_Beliefs_Values_and_Goals","266500478_Multiple-Group_confirmatory_factor_analysis_in_R_-_A_tutorial_in_measurement_invariance_with_continuous_and_ordinal_indicators","260869575_Engineering_Identity_Development_Among_Pre-Adolescent_Learners","251060246_Evaluating_the_Fit_of_Structural_Equation_Models_Tests_of_Significance_and_Descriptive_Goodness-of-Fit_Measures","240807798_Document_Analysis_as_a_Qualitative_Research_Method","232461925_Toward_a_Broader_Conception_of_Creativity_A_Case_for_mini-c_Creativity","226414916_Culture_Identity_and_Equity_in_the_Mathematics_Classroom","220612644_Computing_education_for_sustainability","40455335_Ambient_Belonging_How_Stereotypical_Cues_Impact_Gender_Participation_in_Computer_Science","344593582_Experiencing_School_Mathematics_Traditional_and_Reform_Approaches_To_Teaching_and_Their_Impact_on_Student_Learning_Revised_and_Expanded_Edition","313083535_The_Perceived_Competence_Scale_for_Children","301483034_Identity_Critical_Agency_and_Engineering_An_Affective_Model_for_Predicting_Engineering_as_a_Career_Choice_Identity_Critical_Agency_and_Engineering_Careers","277681069_Attaining_Self-Regulation","274399205_Establishing_an_Explanatory_Model_for_Mathematics_Identity","258723137_Young_African_American_Children_Constructing_Academic_and_Disciplinary_Identities_in_an_Urban_Science_Classroom","250185374_Chapter_3_Identity_as_an_Analytic_Lens_for_Research_in_Education","249798019_Learning_With_Computer-Based_Learning_Environments_A_Literature_Review_of_Computer_Self-Efficacy","247727963_Investigating_a_Measure_of_Computer_Technology_Domain_Identification_A_Tool_for_Understanding_Gender_Differences_and_Stereotypes","247335265_Social_cognitive_career_theory_and_the_prediction_of_interests_and_choice_goals_in_the_computing_disciplines","246795819_Measuring_the_Gender_Gap_on_the_Internet","234021997_A_Review_and_Synthesis_of_the_Measurement_Invariance_Literature_Suggestions_Practices_and_Recommendations_for_Organizational_Research","233253342_Evaluating_Goodness-of-Fit_Indexes_for_Testing_Measurement_Invariance","232469344_The_structure_of_academic_self-concept_The_Marsh-Shavelson_Model_Journal_of_Educational_Psychology_824_623-633","232442908_Exploratory_and_Confirmatory_Factor_Analysis_Understanding_Concepts_and_Applications","228079281_Cutoff_Criteria_for_Fit_Indexes_in_Covariance_Structure_Analysis_Conventional_Criteria_Versus_New_Alternatives","227730166_Understanding_the_science_experiences_of_women_of_color_Science_identity_as_an_analytic_lens_Journal_of_Research_in_Science_Teaching_448_1187-1218","227698159_Is_science_me_High_school_students'_identities_participation_and_aspirations_in_science_engineering_and_medicine","227672451_Connecting_High_School_Physics_Experiences_Outcome_Expectations_Physics_Identity_and_Physics_Career_Choice_A_Gender_Study","227605407_Unraveling_Bias_From_Student_Evaluations_of_Their_High_School_Science_Teachers","227512870_Images_of_self_and_others_as_computer_users_The_role_of_gender_and_experience","227100145_The_Relationship_of_Computer_Self-Efficacy_Expectations_to_Computer_Interest_and_Course_Enrollment_in_College","224101738_The_utility_business_model_and_the_future_of_computing_services","222380546_Gender_Differences_in_Computer-Related_Attitudes_and_Behavior_A_Meta-Analysis","220808275_Still_a_stranger_here_attitudes_among_secondary_school_students_towards_computer_science","200824454_Power_Analysis_and_Determination_of_Sample_Size_for_Covariance_Structure_Modeling_Article","200772446_Gender_Differences_in_Computer_Attitudes_and_Use_Among_College_Students","34304241_Constructing_engineers_through_practice_gendered_features_of_learning_and_identity_development","21320736_The_Neck_Disability_Index_A_Study_of_Reliability_and_Validity","11842647_Test-Retest_Reliability_of_Anxiety_Symptoms_and_Diagnoses_With_the_Anxiety_Disorders_Interview_Schedule_for_DSM-IV_Child_and_Parent_Versions","7267428_Who's_computing_Gender_and_race_differences_in_young_adults'_decisions_to_pursue_an_information_technology_career"]}
