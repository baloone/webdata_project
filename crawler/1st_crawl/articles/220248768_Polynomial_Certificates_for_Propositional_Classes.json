{"id":"220248768_Polynomial_Certificates_for_Propositional_Classes","abstract":"This paper studies the query complexity of learning classes of expressions in propositional logic from equivalence and membership queries. We give new constructions of polynomial size certificates of non- membership for monotone, unate and Horn CNF functions. Our con- structions yield quantitatively dierent bounds from previous construc- tions of certificates for these classes. We prove lower bounds on certificate size which show that for some parameter settings the certificates we con- struct for these classes are exactly optimal. Finally, we also prove that a natural generalization of these classes, the class of renamable Horn CNF functions, does not have polynomial size certificates of non-membership, thus answering an open question of Feigelson.","authors":["Marta Arias","Aaron Feigelson","Roni Khardon","Rocco A.
