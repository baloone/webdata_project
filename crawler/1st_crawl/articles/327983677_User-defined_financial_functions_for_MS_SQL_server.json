{"id":"327983677_User-defined_financial_functions_for_MS_SQL_server","abstract":"The paper deals with mathematical preparation and subsequent programming of various types of financial functions with using of Transact-SQL in Database Management System MS SQL Server. Financial functions are used to automate calculations in the area of Financial Economics. In MS SQL Server, any financial functions are not offered for financial data processing, how such as in program MS Excel. We emphasize that we have used a different calculation methods to create financial formulas, not those used in Excel. If users want to work with some special functions, there is a possibility to prepare User-Defined Functions (UDFs). The use of UDFs will make it easier to work on financial calculations in large databases. © 2018 International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.","authors":["Jolana Gubalová","Petra Medvedova"],"meta":["January 2018International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications 9(9)","DOI:10.14569/IJACSA.2018.090903"],"references":["291463163_Using_Excel_for_Duct_Calculations_User_Defined_Functions","287255924_An_Introduction_to_the_Mathematics_of_Financial_Derivatives_Third_Edition","282173260_Improving_Image_Processing_Performance_Using_Database_User-Defined_Functions","266657652_Consolidation_of_Queries_with_User-Defined_Functions","264918983_Understanding_the_Mathematics_of_Personal_Finance_An_Introduction_to_Financial_Literacy","220269764_A_data_mining_system_based_on_SQL_queries_and_UDFs_for_relational_databases","4053361_Supporting_ancillary_values_from_user_defined_functions_in_Oracle"]}
