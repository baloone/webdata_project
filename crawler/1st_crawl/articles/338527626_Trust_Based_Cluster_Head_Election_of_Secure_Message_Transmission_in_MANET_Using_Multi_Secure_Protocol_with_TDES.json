{"id":"338527626_Trust_Based_Cluster_Head_Election_of_Secure_Message_Transmission_in_MANET_Using_Multi_Secure_Protocol_with_TDES","abstract":"In wireless communication, Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) consists of a number of mobile nodes which are communicated with each other without any base station. One of the security attacks in MANETs is Packet forwarding misbehaviour attack; this makes MANETs weak by showing message loss behavior. For securing message transmission in MANET, the work proposes Energy Efficient Clustering Protocol (EECP) with Radial Basis Function (RBF) based CH is elected for formed Clusters. Moreover, here some Network measures are considered to detect the malicious nodes and CH model that is speed, mobility, trust and so on. The trust value of the node is computed from the neighbor node which helps in further location to find a malicious node in the network to avail message drop and energy consumption (EC). After detecting malicious nodes, Multi secure Protocols that is Secure Efficient Distance Vector Routing (SEDV) and Secure Link State Routing Protocol (SLSP) with encryption technique used for message security. If the\" HELLO\" message sending by the sender, its encrypted and decrypted triples in receiver end to get the plain message, this technique is Triple Data Encryption Standard (TDES). Finally, the implementation results are evaluated to analyze the message security level of the proposed system in MANET in terms, of Packet to Delivery Ratio (PDR, Network Life Time (NLT) and some other important Measures.","authors":["Dr K.
