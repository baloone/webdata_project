{"id":"324519566_A_Fistful_of_Dollars_Formalizing_Asymptotic_Complexity_Claims_via_Deductive_Program_Verification","abstract":"We present a framework for simultaneously verifying the functional correctness and the worst-case asymptotic time complexity of higher-order imperative programs. We build on top of Separation Logic with Time Credits, embedded in an interactive proof assistant. We formalize the O notation, which is key to enabling modular specifications and proofs. We cover the subtleties of the multivariate case, where the complexity of a program fragment depends on multiple parameters. We propose a way of integrating complexity bounds into specifications, present lemmas and tactics that support a natural reasoning style, and illustrate their use with a collection of examples.","authors":["Armaël Guéneau","Arthur Charguéraud","François Pottier"],"meta":["April 2018","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-89884-1_19","In book: Programming Languages and Systems (pp.533-560)"],"references":["319988809_Verifying_the_Correctness_and_Amortized_Complexity_of_a_Union-Find_Implementation_in_Separation_Logic_with_Time_Credits","316898926_Towards_Automatic_Resource_Bound_Analysis_for_OCaml","312013362_Towards_automatic_resource_bound_analysis_for_OCaml","303955695_Proving_Divide_and_Conquer_Complexities_in_IsabelleHOL","268325896_Formalization_of_O_Notation_in_IsabelleHOL","320388365_TiML_a_functional_language_for_practical_complexity_analysis_with_invariants","318369848_Automated_Resource_Analysis_with_Coq_Proof_Objects","301098145_Contents_of_the_Elements_of_Mathematics_Series","282481496_General_Topology","271573415_Coquelicot_A_User-Friendly_Library_of_Real_Analysis_for_Coq"]}
