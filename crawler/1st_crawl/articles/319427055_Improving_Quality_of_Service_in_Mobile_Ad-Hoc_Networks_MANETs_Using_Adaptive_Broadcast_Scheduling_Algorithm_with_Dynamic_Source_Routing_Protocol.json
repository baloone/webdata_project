{"id":"319427055_Improving_Quality_of_Service_in_Mobile_Ad-Hoc_Networks_MANETs_Using_Adaptive_Broadcast_Scheduling_Algorithm_with_Dynamic_Source_Routing_Protocol","abstract":"In Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET), the mobile nodes are connected to transfer the data from source to destination in which the mobile nodes communicate with each other without any access point because of infrastructure less network. The MANET has no centralized controller and it has the dynamic network topology, so the routing overhead and energy consumption are increased, therefore it will lead to long path delay, loss of QoS, and throughput will be reduced. Hence the QoS provisioning is important issue in MANET because of infrastructure less network. The links interruption is occurred due to the dynamic topology of MANET and the topology is changing repeatedly which leads the scheduling algorithm more complicated. In this paper, we propose an adaptive broadcast scheduling algorithm to schedule the packets for mobile nodes in MANET using DSR (Dynamic source Routing) as the routing protocol. By using the NS-2 simulator, the scheduler performance has been studied and the performance can be decomposed by using the parameters such as energy consumption, throughput, end-to-end delay, bandwidth estimation and overhead of routing. Our proposed scheme well provides the high throughput, low end-to-end delay it will provide QoS provisioning in MANET.","authors":["Kumar Viswanthan"],"meta":["September 2017Journal of Computational and Theoretical Nanoscience 14(9):4370-4376","DOI:10.1166/jctn.2017.6744"],"references":["224644677_A_New_solution_to_Estimate_the_available_Bandwidth_in_MANETs","224372181_Cooperative_communications_for_improved_throughput_range_and_covertness","4226881_AODV_based_Energy_Efficient_Routing_Protocol_for_Maximum_Lifetime_in_MANET"]}
