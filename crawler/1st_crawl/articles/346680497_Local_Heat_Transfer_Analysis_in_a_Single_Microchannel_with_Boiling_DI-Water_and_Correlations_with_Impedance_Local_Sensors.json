Flow boiling heat transfer to DI-water in a single microchannel with a rectangular cross section was experimentally investigated. The rectangular cross section dimensions of the experimented microchannel were 1050 µm × 500 µm and 1500 µm × 500 µm. Experiments under conditions of boiling were performed in a test setup, which allows the optical and local impedance measurements of the fluids by mass fluxes of 22.1 kg · m −2 · s −1 to 118.8 kg · m −2 · s −1 and heat fluxes in the range of 14.7 kW · m −2 to 116.54 kW · m −2. The effect of the mass flux, heat flux, and flow pattern on flow boiling local heat transfer coefficient and pressure drop were investigated. Experimental data compared to existing correlations indicated no single correlation of good predictive value. This was concluded to be the case due to the instability of flow conditions on one hand and the variation of the flow regimes over the experimental conditions on the other hand. The results from the local impedance measurements in correlation to the optical measurements shows the flow regime variation at the experimental conditions. From these measurements, useful parameters for use in models on boiling like the 3-zone model were shown. It was shown that the sensing method can shed a precise light on unknown features locally in slug flow such as residence time of each phases, bubble frequency, and duty cycle.","authors":["Mohammadmahdi Talebi","Sahba Sadir","Manfred Kraut","Roland Dittmeyer"],"meta":["December 2020Energies 13(6473):1-30","DOI:10.3390/en13236473","Project: Experimental investigation and theoretical modeling of evaporation processes in microchannels"],"references":["338824793_Flow_Boiling_of_Water_in_a_Rectangular_Metallic_Microchannel","337164284_Supercapillary_Architecture-Activated_Two-Phase_Boundary_Layer_Structures_for_Highly_Stable_and_Efficient_Flow_Boiling_Heat_Transfer","333651581_Flow_boiling_of_HFE-7100_in_microchannels_Experimental_study_and_comparison_with_correlations","338601264_Investigation_of_Slug_Flow_in_Microchannel_Boiling_by_Impedimetric_Sensing","335011556_Investigation_of_water_microchannel_boiling_flow_regimes_using_electrical_sensing_elements_along_a_single_microchannel","327194998_Flow_Regime_Detection_of_Boiling_Flow_in_Microchannels_Using_Electrical_Sensing_Elements_Validated_by_Videography","326164263_Analysis_of_impedance_data_from_bubble_flow_in_a_glassSU8_microfluidic_device_with_on-channel_sensors","325228731_Flow_Boiling_in_Mini_to_Microdiameter_Channels_Modeling_Methodologies_Boiling_of_CO_and_Micro-Two-Phase_CoolingA_4-Volume_Set","324896157_A_new_flow_pattern-based_boiling_heat_transfer_model_for_micro-pin_fin_evaporators","323884237_Investigation_of_boiling_phenomena_in_microchannels_using_impedance_spectroscopy_technique_correlated_with_videography","320453253_Enhanced_flow_boiling_in_microchannels_using_auxiliary_channels_and_multiple_micronozzles_I_Characterizations_of_flow_boiling_heat_transfer","319206791_Enhanced_flow_boiling_in_microchannels_using_auxiliary_channels_and_multiple_micronozzles_II_Enhanced_CHF_and_reduced_pressure_drop","316727114_Physics_of_the_Microchannel_Flow_Boiling_Process_and_Comparison_With_the_Existing_Theories","313353052_An_updated_three-zone_heat_transfer_model_for_slug_flow_boiling_in_microchannels","312919031_Laminar_Flow_Forced_Convection_in_Ducts_A_Source_Book_for_Compact_Heat_Exchanger_Analytical_Data"]}
