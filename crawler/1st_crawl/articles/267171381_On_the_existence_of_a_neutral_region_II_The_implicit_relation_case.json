{"id":"267171381_On_the_existence_of_a_neutral_region_II_The_implicit_relation_case","abstract":"Interesting objects, lying on the borderline between fixed point theory and computational geometry, have appeared recently. These objects, which are variations of the widely used object called \"the Voronoi diagram\", are called \"zone diagrams\", \"double zone diagrams\", and \"(double) territory diagrams\". They induce a decomposition of a given space into regions. This decomposition is obtained from an implicit relation, a collection of subsets (sites), and a distance function. In several works it was claimed without providing a proof that the corresponding decomposition must contain a special region: the neutral region. This paper shows that this assertion is true in a wide class of cases but not in general. It also shows that this region can be used to justify the interpretation of a zone diagram as a certain equilibrium between mutually hostile opponents. The relation between this equilibrium and the Nash equilibrium from game theory and the relation between the neutral region and forbidden zones axe explained.","authors":["Daniel Reem"],"meta":["January 2014Journal of Nonlinear and Convex Analysis 15(3)"],"references":["45890347_Zone_Diagrams_in_Euclidean_Spaces_and_in_Other_Normed_Spaces","279959776_Voronoi_DiagramsPartially_supported_by_the_Deutsche_Forschungsgemeinschaft_grant_K1_655_2-2","242988566_Nonexpansive_iterations_in_hyperbolic_space","230873253_Non-Cooperative_Games","230733022_On_the_Existence_of_a_Neutral_Region","222707716_Distance_k-Sectors_Exist","221591871_The_distance_trisector_curve","220939551_An_Algorithm_for_Computing_Voronoi_Diagrams_of_General_Generators_in_General_Normed_Spaces","220617043_Zone_Diagrams_Existence_Uniqueness_and_Algorithmic_Challenge","216301157_Equilibrium_points_in_n-person_games_Proc_Natl_Acad_Sci_USA","45901922_Zone_diagrams_in_compact_subsets_of_uniformly_convex_normed_spaces","1760955_Zone_and_double_zone_diagrams_in_abstract_spaces"]}
