{"id":"3175453_MUSIC_maximum_likelihood_and_Cramer-Rao_bound","abstract":"The performance of the MUSIC and ML methods is studied, and their\nstatistical efficiency is analyzed. The Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for the\nestimation problems is derived, and some useful properties of the CRB\ncovariance matrix are established. The relationship between the MUSIC\nand ML estimators is investigated as well. A numerical study is reported\nof the statistical efficiency of the MUSIC estimator for the problem of\nfinding the directions of two plane waves using a uniform linear array.\nAn exact description of the results is included","authors":["Petre Peter Stoica","Nehorai Arye"],"meta":["June 1989IEEE Transactions on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing 37(5):720 - 741","DOI:10.1109/29.17564","SourceIEEE Xplore"],"references":["224739052_Asymptotic_performance_of_eigenstructure_spectral_analysis_methods","224737189_High_resolution_bearing_estimation_without_eigen_decomposition","3999398_Maximum_likelihood_estimation_via_the_alternating_projection_maximization_algorithm","3178116_Implementation_of_Adaptive_Array_Algorithms","3178019_An_Algorithm_for_Pole-Zero_Modeling_and_Spectral_Analysis","3177920_The_Resolution_of_Overlapping_Echos","3177856_On_spatial_smoothing_of_estimation_of_coherent_signals","3177764_Detection_of_signals_by_information_theoretic_criteria","3175479_Maximum_likelihood_estimation_of_the_parameters_of_multiple_sinusoids_from_noisy_measurements","3175354_Maximum_Likelihood_Localization_of_Multiple_Sources_by_Alternating_Projection","3175245_Parameter_estimation_of_superimposed_signals_using_the_EM_algorithm","3020117_On_the_Expectation_of_the_Product_of_Four_Matrix-Valued_Gaussian_Random_Variables","2996164_Estimation_of_Frequencies_of_Multiple_Sinusoids_Making_Linear_Prediction_Perform_Like_Maximum_Likelihood","286419208_The_Advanced_Theory_of_Statistics","245493241_Array_processing_with_generalized_beamformers","243782121_Multiple_Tone_Parameter_Estimation_From_Discrete-Time_Observations","238675693_An_introduction_to_multivariate_statistical_analysis_2nd_ed","224738272_Adaptivity_to_bakground_noise_spatial_coherence_for_high_resolution_passive_methods","224737903_On_the_statistical_sufficiency_of_the_coherently_averaged_covariance_matrix_for_the_estimation_of_the_parameters_of_wideband_sources","224737615_Adaptive_algorithms_for_estimating_the_complete_covariance_eigenstructure","224737557_Single_vector_approaches_to_eigenstructure_analysis_for_harmonic_retrieval","224737278_Simple_effective_computation_of_principal_eigenvectors_and_their_eigenvalues_and_application_to_high-resolution_estimation_of_frequencies","224682699_A_comparative_study_of_modern_eigenstructure_methods_for_bearing_estimation-A_new_high_performance_approach","224657459_Maximum_likelihood_estimation_by_simulated_annealing","224337272_Asymptotic_results_for_eigenvector_methods","222997132_On_reparametrization_of_loss_functions_used_in_estimation_and_the_invariance_principle","38366194_Asymptotic_Theory_for_Principal_Component_Analysis","27606461_The_covariance_difference_method_in_signal_detection","3545428_Maximum_likelihood_estimation_of_exponential_signals_in_noise_using_a_Newton_algorithm","3178146_Exact_maximum_likelihood_parameter_estimation_of_superimposed_exponential_signals_in_noise","3178134_On_the_performance_of_signal-subspace_processing--_Part_I_Narrow-band_systems","3178133_Simple_effective_computation_of_principal_eigenvectors_and_their_eigenvalues_and_application_to_high-resolution_estimation_of_frequencies","3178124_ESPRIT-A_Subspace_Rotation_Approach_to_Estimation_of_Parameters_of_Cisoids_in_Noise","3178013_The_Statistical_Performance_of_the_MUSIC_and_the_Minimum-Norm_Algorithms_in_Resolving_Plane_Waves_in_Noise","3177985_The_statistical_performance_of_the_MUSIC_and_the_Minimum-Norm_algorithms_in_resolving_plane_waves_in_noise","3177425_Optimality_of_high_resolution_array_processing_using_the_eigensystem_approach","3175683_Highly_parallel_recursiveiterative_Toeplitz_eigenspace_decomposition_array_processing","3082459_Single_Tone_Parameter_Estimation_From_Discrete-Time_Observations","3016535_Multiple_Emitter_Location_and_Signal_Parameter_Estimation","3004753_Estimating_the_Angles_of_Arrival_of_Multiple_Plane_Waves","2997272_Maximum-Likelihood_Estimation_of_Parameters_of_Exponentially_Damped_Sinusoids"]}
