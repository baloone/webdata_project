{"id":"346012612_Isogeometric_Residual_Minimization_iGRM_for_Non-Stationary_Stokes_and_Navier-Stokes_Problems","abstract":"We show that it is possible to obtain a linear computational cost FEM-based solver for non-stationary Stokes and Navier-Stokes equations. Our method employs a technique developed by Guermond & Minev [20], which consists of singular perturbation plus a splitting scheme. While the time-integration schemes are implicit, we use finite elements to discretize the spatial counterparts. At each time-step, we solve a PDE having weak-derivatives in one direction only (which allows for the linear computational cost), at the expense of handling strong second-order derivatives of the previous time step solution, on the right-hand side of these PDEs. This motivates the use of smooth functions such as B-splines. For high Reynolds numbers, some of these PDEs become unstable. To deal robustly with these instabilities, we propose to use a residual minimization technique. We test our method on problems having manufactured solutions, as well as on the cavity flow problem.","authors":["Marcin Łoś","Ignacio Muga","Judit Muñoz-Matute","Maciej Paszynski"],"meta":["November 2020Computers and Mathematics with Applications 95(5)","DOI:10.1016/j.camwa.2020.11.013","Project: isogeometric Residual Minimization Method (iGRM)"],"references":["340369264_A_Computational_Comparison_Between_Isogeometric_Analysis_and_Spectral_Element_Methods_Accuracy_and_Spectral_Properties","333811277_Isogeometric_Residual_Minimization_Method_iGRM_with_Direction_Splitting_for_Non-Stationary_Advection-Diffusion_Problems","327968356_Object-oriented_implementation_of_the_Alternating_Directions_Implicit_Solver_for_Isogeometric_Analysis","305995231_A_Geometric_Multigrid_Preconditioning_Strategy_for_DPG_System_Matrices","265739088_Adaptivity_and_Variational_Stabilization_for_Convection-Diffusion_Equations","342297140_A_Massively_Parallel_Algorithm_for_the_Three-Dimensional_Navier-Stokes-Boussinesq_Simulations_of_the_Atmospheric_Phenomena","308168354_On_the_numerical_solution_of_heat_conduction_problems_in_two_and_three_space_variables","290872795_A_new_finite_element_formulation_for_computational_fluid_dynamics_VII_The_stokes_problem_with_various_well-posed_boundary_conditions_Symmetric_formulations_that_converge_for_all_velocitypressure_space","269384845_Convergence_of_an_ADI_splitting_for_Maxwell's_equations","265425546_Mathematical_Aspects_of_Discontinuous_Galerkin_Methods"]}
