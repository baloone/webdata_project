{"id":"305279255_Cost_Modeling_and_Optimization_of_a_Manufacturing_System_for_Mycelium-based_Biocomposite_Parts","abstract":"A manufacturing cost model is created that includes all labor, material and overhead costs for novel mycelium-based biocomposite sandwich structures produced by a commercial firm. This model is implemented through a spreadsheet to calculate the equivalent uniform annual costs (UAC) of all manufacturing facilities. A simulation model of the manufacturing line is then implemented based on all these costs as well as system parameters experimentally measured from real manufacturing operations. The Tabu search method is utilized to search for the best manufacturing configuration including optimal number of machines and workers for each manufacturing step under both the current and projected production situations. The optimal solution can be used by the spreadsheet tool to calculate the net cost of each manufactured part and determine a proper retail price. The manufacturing system presented and associated models can be used by manufacturing personnel to assess the commercial viability of bicomposite parts.","authors":["Lai Jiang","Daniel Walczyk","Gavin Mcintyre","Victor W.
