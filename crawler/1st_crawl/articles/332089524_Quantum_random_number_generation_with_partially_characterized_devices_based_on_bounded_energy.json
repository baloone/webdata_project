We achieve a random bit rate above 1 MHz.","authors":["Davide Rusca","Thomas van Himbeeck","Anthony Martin","Jonatan Bohr Brask"],"meta":["January 2019","DOI:10.1364/QIM.2019.S1B.3","Conference: Quantum Information and Measurement"],"references":["311769868_Semi-device-independent_framework_based_on_natural_physical_assumptions"]}
