{"id":"279633339_Approximating_Sampled_Sinusoids_and_Multiband_Signals_Using_Multiband_Modulated_DPSS_Dictionaries","abstract":"Many signal processing problems--such as analysis, compression, denoising,\nand reconstruction--can be facilitated by expressing the signal as a linear\ncombination of atoms from a well-chosen dictionary. In this paper, we study\npossible dictionaries for representing the discrete vector one obtains when\ncollecting a finite set of uniform samples from a multiband analog signal. By\nanalyzing the spectrum of combined time- and multiband-limiting operations in\nthe discrete-time domain, we conclude that the information level of the sampled\nmultiband vectors is essentially equal to the time-frequency area. For\nrepresenting these vectors, we consider a dictionary formed by concatenating a\ncollection of modulated Discrete Prolate Spheroidal Sequences (DPSS's). We\nstudy the angle between the subspaces spanned by this dictionary and an optimal\ndictionary, and we conclude that the multiband modulated DPSS dictionary--which\nis simple to construct and more flexible than the optimal dictionary in\npractical applications--is nearly optimal for representing multiband sample\nvectors. We also show that the multiband modulated DPSS dictionary not only\nprovides a very high degree of approximation accuracy in an MSE sense for\nmultiband sample vectors (using a number of atoms comparable to the information\nlevel), but also that it can provide high-quality approximations of all sampled\nsinusoids within the bands of interest.","authors":["Zhihui Zhu","Michael B.
