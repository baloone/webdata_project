{"id":"285956479_Ubiquitous_Learning_Project_Using_Life-logging_Technology_in_Japan","abstract":"A Ubiquitous Learning Log (ULL) is defined as a digital record of what a learner has learned in daily life using ubiquitous computing technologies. In this paper, a project which developed a system called SCROLL (System for Capturing and Reusing Of Learning Log) is presented. The aim of developing SCROLL is to help learners record, organize, recall and evaluate ULLs. Using SCROLL, learners can not only receive personalized quizzes and answers to the questions, but also navigate and be aware of their past ULLs supported by augmented reality views. In particular, this paper introduces an approach that helps learners record their learning experiences in daily life from life-log photos with the help of SenseCam. To evaluate the effectiveness of this system, a case study of an undergraduate English course is presented to show how it can be used to facilitate seamless learning.
