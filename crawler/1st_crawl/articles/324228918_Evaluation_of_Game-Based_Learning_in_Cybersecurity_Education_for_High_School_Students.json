{"id":"324228918_Evaluation_of_Game-Based_Learning_in_Cybersecurity_Education_for_High_School_Students","abstract":"Game based learning is a new game play mechanism that the players explore various aspects of game play in a learning context designed by the instructor or the game designer. Nevertheless, general acceptance of game based learning as a new learning paradigm was deferred by a lack of well-controlled, large sample efficacy studies. To address the increasing need of cybersecurity workforce, this paper introduces a game based learning method for high school cybersecurity education. Purdue University Northwest launched GenCyber high school summer camps to about 200 high school students in Chicago metropolitan area. The survey conducted after the summer camp indicated that the game based learning for cybersecurity education was very effective in cybersecurity awareness training. Further analysis of survey data revealed that there is a gender difference in raising studentsâ€™ interests in cybersecurity and computer science education using game based learning method.","authors":["Ge Jin","Manghui Tu","Tae-Hoon Kim","Justin Heffron"],"meta":["February 2018Journal of Education and Learning (EduLearn) 12(1):150","DOI:10.11591/edulearn.v12i1.7736"],"references":["315210827_Cybersecurity_What_About_US_Policy","313814425_Data_Loss_Prevention_Management_and_Control_Inside_Activity_Incident_Monitoring_Identification_and_Tracking_in_Healthcare_Enterprise_Environments","326395523_Assessing_and_responding_to_the_growth_of_computer_science_undergraduate_enrollments","309449704_GenCyber_Inspiring_the_Next_Generation_of_Cyber_Stars","235793689_Hands-On_Activities_and_Challenge_Tests_in_Agricultural_and_Environmental_Education","224203450_Usability_Failures_and_Healthcare_Data_Hemorrhages","220284206_The_Relationship_between_Student_Learning_Styles_and_Motivation_during_Educational_Video_Game_Play"]}
