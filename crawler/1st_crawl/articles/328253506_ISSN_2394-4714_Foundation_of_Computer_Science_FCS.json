It is simple, quick and efficient mode of money transfer. From common man to business man, everyone is taking advantage of these applications to make transactions easy. However, with advancements in technology, security threats have increased drastically. In this research paper, secured payment protocol using self-certified key generation method has been suggested. In order to understand, potential security threats in any payment protocol, one should have clear idea about possible vulnerabilities in it. Considering these vulnerabilities, authors have suggested preliminary version for new payment protocol. In this analysis, authors have used various methodologies like reverse engineering, study of security attacks. Also authors have proposed an energy-efficient model to improve energy efficiency for payment application.This study will be helpful in improving security in payment application and in growth of e-commerce bussiness.","authors":["Swapna Khandekar","Richard Kolk","Jingyuan Liang"],"meta":["January 2017"],"references":["295863354_Security_Research_of_a_Social_Payment_App_and_Suggested_Improvement","223099838_An_empirical_study_of_customers'_perceptions_of_security_and_trust_in_e-payment_systems","4315136_Are_Mobile_Payment_and_Banking_the_Killer_Apps_for_Mobile_Commerce","266225225_Impact_of_Security_Attacks_on_a_New_Security_Protocol_for_Mobile_Ad_Hoc_Networks","260305884_Addressing_Security_and_Privacy_Risks_in_Mobile_Applications","223823732_From_desktop_to_mobile_Examining_the_security_experience","222403303_A_secure_vehicle-to-roadside_communication_payment_protocol_in_vehicular_ad_hoc_networks","220425989_Reflections_on_Trusting_Trust","220424477_Software_security_and_privacy_risks_in_mobile_E-_commerce","220212299_An_efficient_and_secure_mobile_payment_protocol_for_restricted_connectivity_scenarios_in_vehicular_ad_hoc_network"]}
