{"id":"220690134_Reversible_Computing_Fundamentals_Quantum_Computing_and_Applications","abstract":"Written by one of the few top internationally recognized experts in the field, this book concentrates on those topics that will remain fundamental, such as low power computing, reversible programming languages, and applications in thermodynamics. It describes reversible computing from various points of view: Boolean algebra, group theory, logic circuits, low-power electronics, communication, software, quantum computing. It is this multidisciplinary approach that makes it unique. Backed by numerous examples, this is useful for all levels of the scientific and academic community, from undergraduates to established academics.","authors":["Alexis De Vos"],"meta":["November 2010","DOI:10.1002/9783527633999","SourceDBLP","Publisher: WileyISBN: 978-3-527-40992-1"],"references":["277294839_On_Efficient_Adiabatic_Design_of_MOS_Circuits","230914708_Fredkin_gates_for_finite-valued_reversible_and_conservative_logics","228873649_An_introduction_to_reversible_circuits","222819754_Majority-based_reversible_logic_gates","8195269_Quantum_Circuits_for_General_Multiqubit_Gates","4051011_FredkinToffoli_templates_for_reversible_logic_synthesis","3337661_Synthesis_of_Fredkin-Toffoli_reversible_networks","3323547_Optimal_charging_of_capacitors","3318431_Generalized_S_Transform","3318095_Matrix_factorizations_for_reversible_integer_mapping","3225834_Synthesis_of_Quantum_Logic_Circuits","298849040_Quantum_Algorithms_Applicable_Algebra_and_Quantum_Physics","279896287_Quantum_computation","265399614_Counting_Groups_Gnus_Moas_and_other_Exotica","260785032_The_Fundamental_Physical_Limits_of_Computation","260648778_On_the_Entropy_Current","249336791_Flexible_bandwidth_provision_and_scheduling_in_a_packet_switch_with_an_optical_core","243359462_Inversion_of_the_Helmholtz_or_Laplace-Poisson_Operator_for_Slab_Geometry","243116226_Young_subgroups_for_reversible_computers","242790988_An_interpreter_for_the_Boolean_derivative","239380660_Algorithm_to_derive_minimum_ESOP_for_6-variabe_function","239009053_Equipartition_Principles_in_Finite-Time_Thermodynamics","237005581_Entropy_and_the_Evolution_of_Biological_Information","234816149_Minimal_Energy_Dissipation_in_Logic","234810961_On_reversible_subroutines_and_computers_that_run_backwards","232327403_The_Asymptotic_Number_of_Integer_Stochastic_Matrices","231130052_Generating_the_group_of_reversible_logic_gates","231126301_r-Universal_reversible_logic_gates","230977833_Implementing_an_arbitrary_reversible_logic_gate","229887914_Analysing_the_operation_of_the_basic_pass_transistor_structure","229761551_Synthesis_of_reversible_logic_for_nanoelectronic_circuits","229132528_Some_applications_of_doubly_stochastic_matrices","226765049_Six_Synthesis_Methods_for_Reversible_Logic","226450272_The_Expectation_Value_of_the_Entropy_of_a_Digital_Message","224733323_Control_Algorithms_for_Rearrangeable_Clos_Networks","224600985_Fast_Algorithm_and_Low-Cost_Hardware-Sharing_Design_of_Multiple_Integer_Transforms_for_VC-1","224585588_BDD-based_synthesis_of_reversible_logic_for_large_functions","224393116_Efficient_Fast_1-D_8_8_Inverse_Integer_Transform_for_VC-1_Application","224102039_Signal_entropy_and_the_thermodynamics_of_computation","222793118_Entropy_and_information_in_processes_of_self-organization_uncertainty_and_predictability","221957784_On_the_relation_between_various_entropy_concepts_and_the_valoric_interpretation","221151089_Reversible_computing_From_mathematical_group_theory_to_electronical_circuit_experiment","220475081_Decomposition_of_a_Linear_Reversible_Computer_Digital_Versus_Analog","220297074_A_Combinatorial_Approach_to_the_Double_Cosets_of_the_Symmetric_Group_with_respect_to_Young_Subgroups","220288496_Path_colorings_in_bipartite_graphs","220111717_Algorithms_counting_monotone_Boolean_functions","45914129_Synthesis_of_Reversible_Functions_Beyond_Gate_Count_and_Quantum_Cost","3477182_On_Minimal_Modulo_2_Sums_of_Products_for_Switching_Functions","3422398_Reducing_quantum_computations_to_elementary_unitary_operations","3345708_A_perspective_from_the_2003_ITRS_MOSFET_scaling_trends_challenges_and_potential_solutions","3199039_Nonblocking_repackable_and_rearrangeable_Clos_networks_Fifty_years_of_the_theory_evolution","3199038_Matching_algorithms_for_three-stage_bufferless_Clos_network_switches","3158276_A_Nonbacktracking_Matrix_Decomposition_Algorithm_for_Routing_on_Clos_Networks","3047424_Conservative_Logic_Elements_and_Their_Universality","3001335_The_High-k_Solution"]}
