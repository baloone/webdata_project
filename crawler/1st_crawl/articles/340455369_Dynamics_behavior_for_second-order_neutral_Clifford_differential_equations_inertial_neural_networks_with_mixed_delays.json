{"id":"340455369_Dynamics_behavior_for_second-order_neutral_Clifford_differential_equations_inertial_neural_networks_with_mixed_delays","abstract":"In this paper, Clifford-valued inertial neutral neural networks with time-varying delays and infinite distributed delay are investigated. With the help of the pseudo almost periodic function theory, Banachâ€™s fixed point theorem, and the differential inequality theory, a set of sufficient criteria that guarantee the existence and the global exponential stability of unique pseudo-almost periodic solutions of Clifford-valued inertial neutral neural networks with mixed delays are established. Our results are new and complement some previously known ones. Moreover, numerical simulations are carried out to verify our theoretical results.","authors":["Chaouki Aouiti","Imen Ben Gharbia"],"meta":["April 2020","DOI:10.1007/s40314-020-01148-0"],"references":["338096357_Fixed-time_synchronization_of_competitive_neural_networks_with_proportional_delays_and_impulsive_effect","336983470_Global_dissipativity_of_high-order_Hopfield_bidirectional_associative_memory_neural_networks_with_mixed_delays","336573106_Existence_and_Global_Exponential_Stability_of_Pseudo_Almost_Periodic_Solution_for_Clifford-_Valued_Neutral_High-Order_Hopfield_Neural_Networks_With_Leakage_Delays","333387052_Stability_and_Dissipativity_Analysis_for_Neutral_Type_Stochastic_Markovian_Jump_Static_Neural_Networks_with_Time_Delays","333356505_Pseudo_Almost_Periodic_Solution_of_Recurrent_Neural_Networks_with_D_Operator_on_Time_Scales","333055083_Global_Asymptotic_Almost_Periodic_Synchronization_of_Clifford-Valued_CNNs_with_Discrete_Delays","326343913_New_Results_on_Impulsive_Cohen-Grossberg_Neural_Networks","323929743_Design_of_generalized_dissipativity_state_estimator_for_static_neural_networks_including_state_time_delays_and_leakage_delays","323672016_Piecewise_asymptotically_almost_automorphic_solutions_for_impulsive_non-autonomous_high-order_Hopfield_neural_networks_with_mixed_delays","307613765_Neutral_impulsive_shunting_inhibitory_cellular_neural_networks_with_time-varying_coefficients_and_leakage_delays","307598314_Oscillation_of_impulsive_neutral_delay_generalized_high-order_Hopfield_neural_networks","305517390_Anti-periodic_Solutions_of_Inertial_Neural_Networks_with_Time_Delays","299364660_Global_stability_of_Clifford-valued_recurrent_neural_networks_with_time_delays","266959798_Positive_periodic_solutions_for_second-order_neutral_differential_equations_with_functional_delay","258944244_Clifford_Algebra_to_Geometric_Calculus_A_Unified_Language_for_Mathematics_and_Physics","236935585_Applications_of_Clifford's_Geometric_Algebra","336956364_Effect_of_fuzziness_on_stability_of_inertial_neural_networks_with_mixed_delay_via_non-reduced_order_method","336814643_Effects_of_infinite_occurrence_of_hybrid_impulses_with_quasi-synchronization_of_parameter_mismatched_neural_networks","336076361_Memory_feedback_finite-time_control_for_memristive_neutral-type_neural_networks_with_quantization","333733190_Robust_stability_of_uncertain_stochastic_complex-valued_neural_networks_with_additive_time-varying_delays","333004227_Existence_and_Exponential_Stability_of_Piecewise_Pseudo_Almost_Periodic_Solution_of_Neutral-type_Inertial_Neural_Networks_with_Mixed_delay_and_Impulsive_Perturbations","331913601_Stability_and_stabilization_analysis_of_nonlinear_time-delay_systems_with_randomly_occurring_controller_gain_fluctuation","322204109_Existence_and_global_exponential_stability_of_pseudo_almost_periodic_solution_for_neutral_delay_BAM_neural_networks_with_time-varying_delay_in_leakage_terms","316795031_Clifford_Numbers_and_Spinors","268907229_Bericht_uber_die_Theorie_der_fastperiodischen_Funktionen","267433204_Chaos_in_delay_differential_equations_with_applications_in_population_dynamics","266247299_Delay_Nonlinear_Oscillations_and_Shimmying_Wheels","265528414_Clifford_Algebras_and_Lie_Theory","264907219_Clifford_algebras_and_the_classical_groups_Paperback_reprint_of_the_1995_original","245668473_Cli_ord_Algebras_and_the_Classical_Groups","243120540_Zur_Theorie_der_fast_periodischen_Funktionen_1","240282724_The_Algebraic_Theory_of_Spinors","231078223_Delay-dependent_stability_of_neural_networks_of_neutral_type_with_time_delay_in_the_leakage_term","230675296_Applications_of_Grassmann's_Extensive_Algebra","227193241_Hopf_Bifurcation_and_Chaos_in_a_Single_Inertial_Neuron_Model_with_Time_Delay","225498682_Zur_Theorie_der_Fastperiodischen_Funktionen_I","223121942_A_novel_criterion_for_delayed_feedback_control_of_time-delay_chaotic_systems","222391601_Pseudo_Almost_Periodic_Solutions_of_Some_Differential_Equations_II","222353821_Global_stability_for_neural_networks_of_neutral-type_with_interval_time-varying_delays","222286425_LMI_Optimization_approach_on_stability_for_delayed_neural_networks_of_neutral-type","222042730_Delay-dependent_stability_criteria_for_time-delay_chaotic_systems_via_time-delay_feedback_control","220563551_Global_robust_stability_for_stochastic_interval_neural_networks_with_continuously_distributed_delays_of_neutral_type","220096261_Exponential_synchronization_of_chaotic_neural_networks_with_mixed_delays_and_impulsive_effects_via_output_coupling_with_delay_feedback","39296818_Oscillation_of_impulsive_delay_differential_equations_and_applications_to_population_dynamics","35415945_A_theory_of_neural_computation_with_Clifford_algebras","2399857_Back_Propagation_in_a_Clifford_Algebra"]}
