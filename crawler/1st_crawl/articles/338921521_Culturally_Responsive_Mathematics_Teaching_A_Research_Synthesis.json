{"id":"338921521_Culturally_Responsive_Mathematics_Teaching_A_Research_Synthesis","abstract":"The purpose of this article is to synthesize empirical research conducted on culturally responsive mathematics teaching (CRMT) with culturally and linguistically diverse (CLD) learners. Thirty-five published studies between 1993 and 2018 met the criteria for inclusion in this review. Criteria included: (a) the study was published in a peer-reviewed journal, (b) the study was conducted within a K-12 U.S. public school context with practicing teachers, (c) culturally responsive teaching or culturally relevant pedagogy was part of the studyâ€™s theoretical framework, and (d) information about methods was reported. Findings reveal the value of CRMT in fostering equitable and inclusive mathematics learning environments. More research on CRMT with CLD students in school settings is warranted. Implications for policy, practice, and research are discussed.","authors":["Naheed Abdulrahim","Michael John Orosco"],"meta":["March 2020The Urban Review 52(1):1-25","DOI:10.1007/s11256-019-00509-2"],"references":["328568806_Latinx_Bilingual_Students'_Perseverance_on_a_Mathematical_Task_A_Rehumanizing_Perspective","326219362_Asset-Based_Approaches_to_Equitable_Mathematics_Education_Research_and_Practice","322526556_Speaking_their_language_The_role_of_cultural_content_integration_and_heritage_language_for_academic_achievement_among_Latino_children","320046295_Culturally_Responsive_Professional_Development_for_One_Special_Education_Teacher_of_Latino_English_Language_Learners_with_Mathematics_Learning_Disabilities","348866026_An_Introduction_to_Qualitative_Research_Synthesis_Managing_the_Information_Explosion_in_Social_Science_Research","343240131_Discovery_of_grounded_theory_Strategies_for_qualitative_research","331738199_The_Discovery_of_Grounded_Theory_Strategies_for_Qualitative_Research","321995054_Five_Decades_of_Mathematics_Education_Research","321688734_Using_Culturally_Responsive_Stories_in_Mathematics_Responses_From_the_Target_Audience_Using_Culturally_Responsive_Stories_in_Mathematics","321275099_Research_design_qualitative_quantitative_and_mixed_methods_approaches"]}
