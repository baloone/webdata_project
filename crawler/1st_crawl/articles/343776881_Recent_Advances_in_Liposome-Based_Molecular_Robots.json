{"id":"343776881_Recent_Advances_in_Liposome-Based_Molecular_Robots","abstract":"A molecular robot is a microorganism-imitating micro robot that is designed from the molecular level and constructed by bottom-up approaches. As with conventional robots, molecular robots consist of three essential robotics elements: control of intelligent systems, sensors, and actuators, all integrated into a single micro compartment. Due to recent developments in microfluidic technologies, DNA nanotechnologies, synthetic biology, and molecular engineering, these individual parts have been developed, with the final picture beginning to come together. In this review, we describe recent developments of these sensors, actuators, and intelligence systems that can be applied to liposome-based molecular robots. First, we explain liposome generation for the compartments of molecular robots. Next, we discuss the emergence of robotics functions by using and functionalizing liposomal membranes. Then, we discuss actuators and intelligence via the encapsulation of chemicals into liposomes. Finally, the future vision and the challenges of molecular robots are described.","authors":["Kan Shoji","Ryuji Kawano"],"meta":["August 2020Micromachines 11(9):788","DOI:10.3390/mi11090788"],"references":["340016219_Light-Driven_ATP_Regeneration_in_DiblockGrafted_Hybrid_Vesicles","339546538_Shaping_Giant_Membrane_Vesicles_in_3D-Printed_Protein_Hydrogel_Cages","339438764_DNA_nanotechnology_assisted_nanopore-based_analysis","335900420_A_synthetic_metabolic_network_for_physicochemical_homeostasis","345474404_Programmable_reactions_and_diffusion_using_DNA_for_pattern_formation_in_hydrogel_medium","342538853_Recessed_AgAgCl_Microelectrode-Supported_Lipid_Bilayer_for_Nanopore_Sensing","341170004_Chemically_Artificial_Rovers_Based_on_Self-Propelled_Droplets_in_Micrometer-scale_Environment","339116145_Biological_Nanopore_Probe_Probing_of_Viscous_Solutions_in_a_Confined_Nanospace","335613572_Osmotic-Engine-Driven_Liposomes_in_Microfluidic_Channels","335198478_Correction_to_Spatially_Resolved_Chemical_Detection_with_a_Nanoneedle-Probe-Supported_Biological_Nanopore"]}
