{"id":"327912417_Temporal_flexibility_in_the_digital_university_full-time_part-time_flexitime","abstract":"This article engages with the persistent theme of flexibility in online distance education. It argues that, while a discourse of flexibility promises opportunities for access to online education, it also has the potential to devalue it by paying too little attention to educationâ€™s time-consuming practices, often perpetuating a notion of teaching and learning that is depicted as atemporal and free from the constraints of time. The article draws on case study interviews with staff and students engaged in a distance education expansion project in a UK university. A temporal analysis highlights institutional adjustments towards flexibility and draws attention to interview accounts that are indicative of a culture of combined work and study that is beyond full-time, in a wider context in which part-time study is aligned with affordability and made unproblematic as a flexible mode of access. Further research on time and temporality in distance and higher education is recommended.","authors":["Philippa Sheail"],"meta":["September 2018Distance Education 39(1):1-18","DOI:10.1080/01587919.2018.1520039"],"references":["332072939_The_lost_part-timers_The_decline_of_part-time_undergraduate_higher_education_in_England","316538199_The_Disrupted_Workplace_Time_and_the_Moral_Order_of_Flexible_Capitalism","313969897_Narrative_Ethnography","237012126_Quality_of_E-Learners'_Time_and_Learning_Performance_Beyond_Quantitative_Time-on-Task","325354867_Deconstructing_dual-mode_provision_in_a_digital_era","315939440_Openness_and_flexibility_are_the_norm_but_what_are_the_challenges","299135373_Agility_-_a_crucial_capability_for_universities_in_times_of_disruptive_change_and_innovation","267446793_Narrative_Inquiry_Experience_and_Story_in_Qualitative_Research","263263606_Critical_Time","258190566_Timescapes_of_Flexibility_and_Insecurity","254252751_'Finding_an_appropriate_fit_for_me'_Examining_the_inflexibilities_of_international_distance_learning","254228156_Agile_bodies_A_new_imperative_in_neoliberal_governance","254111817_The_Biopolitical_Economy_of_Time","37144018_Feminist_perspectives_on_times_and_spaces_in_distance_learning","30529847_The_Corrosion_of_Character_The_Personal_Consequences_of_Work_in_the_New_Capitalism"]}
