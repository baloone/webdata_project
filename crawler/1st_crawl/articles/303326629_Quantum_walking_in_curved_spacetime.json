{"id":"303326629_Quantum_walking_in_curved_spacetime","abstract":"A discrete-time quantum walk (QW) is essentially a unitary operator driving the evolution of a single particle on the lattice. Some QWs admit a continuum limit, leading to familiar PDEs (e.g., the Dirac equation). In this paper, we study the continuum limit of a wide class of QWs and show that it leads to an entire class of PDEs, encompassing the Hamiltonian form of the massive Dirac equation in (\\(1+1\\)) curved spacetime. Therefore, a certain QW, which we make explicit, provides us with a unitary discrete toy model of a test particle in curved spacetime, in spite of the fixed background lattice. Mathematically, we have introduced two novel ingredients for taking the continuum limit of a QW, but which apply to any quantum cellular automata: encoding and grouping.","authors":["Pablo Arrighi","Stefano Facchini","Marcelo Forets"],"meta":["August 2016Quantum Information Processing 15(8)","DOI:10.1007/s11128-016-1335-7"],"references":["274967454_Quantum_Lattice_Boltzmann_is_a_quantum_walk","261714414_Discrete_Lorentz_covariance_for_Quantum_Walks_and_Quantum_Cellular_Automata","319774715_The_Dirac_Equation","304569976_A_note_on_matrices_with_positive_definite_real_part","291942453_Simulating_Physics_with_Computers","286739931_The_lattice_Boltzmann_equation_for_fluid_dynamics_and_beyond","285096539_Quantum_random_walks_An_introductory_overview","267168963_Positive_Definite_Matrices","266978496_A_Note_on_Matrices_with_Positive_Definite_Real_Part","259604347_Causal_Fermions_in_Discrete_Spacetime","249012022_The_Dirac_equation_as_a_quantum_walk_Higher_dimensions_observational_convergence","249011868_From_Discrete_Time_Quantum_Walk_to_Continuous_Time_Quantum_Walk_in_Limit_Distribution","259220361_Discrete_Spacetime_and_Relativistic_Quantum_Particles","257201485_Decoupled_Quantum_Walks_models_of_the_Klein-Gordon_and_wave_equations","256762556_Quantum_Walks_in_artificial_electric_and_gravitational_Fields"]}
