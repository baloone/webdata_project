{"id":"310472290_Modeling_protein-protein_and_protein-peptide_complexes_CAPRI_6_th_edition","abstract":"We present the sixth report evaluating the performance of methods for predicting the atomic resolution structures of protein complexes offered as targets to the community-wide initiative on the Critical Assessment of Predicted Interactions (CAPRI). The evaluation is based on a total of 20670 predicted models for 8 protein-peptide complexes, a novel category of targets in CAPRI, and 12 protein-protein targets in CAPRI prediction Rounds held during the years 2013-2016. For two of the protein-protein targets, the focus was on the prediction of side-chain conformation and positions of interfacial water molecules. Seven of the protein-protein targets were particularly challenging owing to their multi-component nature, to conformational changes at the binding site, or to a combination of both. Encouragingly, the very large multi-protein complex with the nucleosome was correctly predicted, and correct models were submitted for the protein-peptide targets, but not for some of the challenging protein-protein targets. Models of acceptable quality or better were obtained for 14 of the 20 targets, including medium quality models for 13 targets and high quality models for 8 targets, indicating tangible progress of present-day computational methods in modeling protein complexes with increased accuracy. Our evaluation suggests that the progress stems from better integration of different modeling tools with docking procedures, as well as the use of more sophisticated evolutionary information to score models. Nonetheless, adequate modeling of conformational flexibility in interacting proteins remains an important area with a crucial need for improvement. This article is protected by copyright.
