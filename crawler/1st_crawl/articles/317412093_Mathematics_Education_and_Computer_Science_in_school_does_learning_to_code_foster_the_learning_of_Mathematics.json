{"id":"317412093_Mathematics_Education_and_Computer_Science_in_school_does_learning_to_code_foster_the_learning_of_Mathematics","abstract":"This article proposes a debate that comes from the desire to understand how the learning of mathematics can be promoted when you learn to code. This debate has its origin in doctoral research that investigated how conditional reasoning development occurs in such learning contexts. Throughout this article, we shall provide considerations on the importance of the inclusion of Computer Science teaching in schools and of the development of Computational Thinking. In addition to presenting examples of how learning to code can foster the learning of mathematics, the present study also indicates the intrinsic relationship between logic and mathematics. Thus, this article proposes that mathematics education can be an alternative reason for the inclusion of Computer Science in Elementary School, since learning to code can foster the learning of mathematics and vice versa.","authors":["Anuar Daian de Morais","Marcus Basso","Léa da Cruz Fagundes"],"meta":["June 2017Ciência & Educação (Bauru) 23(2):455-473","DOI:10.1590/1516-731320170020011"],"references":["332584813_Reflexoes_Sobre_o_Raciocinio_Logico_ao_Aprender_a_Programar_no_Squeak_Etoys","277988201_A_INCLUSAO_DIGITAL_DA_ESCOLA_OU_A_INCLUSAO_DA_ESCOLA_NA_CULTURA_DIGITAL","266488613_Portfolio_de_Matematica_um_instrumento_de_analise_do_processo_de_aprendizagem","227645577_Children_and_the_Internet_Experiments_with_minimally_invasive_education_in_India_The_British","220686303_Powerful_ideas_in_the_classroom_using_squeak_to_enhance_math_and_science_learning"]}
