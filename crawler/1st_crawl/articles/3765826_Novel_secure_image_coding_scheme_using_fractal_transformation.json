{"id":"3765826_Novel_secure_image_coding_scheme_using_fractal_transformation","abstract":"Lossy image coding by partitioned iterated function systems\n(PIFS), popularly known as fractal image compression, has become an\nactive area of research. In this technique an image is encoded as a set\nof contractive transformations which represent the image compactly and\nproduce an approximation to the original image. In this paper, we\npresent a new application of fractal image compression in addition to\nobtaining high compression ratios and resolution independence. In\nparticular, we present a novel secure image-coding scheme for still\nimages based on encrypting some parameters in the contractive fractal\ntransformation. This is done such that the end user or customer gets\nonly a partially readable image of low quality. After being attracted by\nthe image, he may access the full clear image upon request. In this\ncase, the distributor will supply the customer with a simple key to\nretrieve the clear image from the low qualify one. The proposed\ntechnique is highly secure and, in addition, it provides a relatively\nhigh compression of the amount of information and bandwidth needed to\ntransmit still images","authors":["Said El-Khamy","H.E.-D.M.
