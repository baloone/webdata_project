{"id":"281395244_Formal_Specification_and_Verification_of_Separation_Kernels_An_Overview","abstract":"Separation kernel, a fundamental software of safety and security critical\nsystems, provides to its hosted software applications high-assurance\npartitioning and information flow control properties. The application of\nseparation kernel in critical domain demands the correctness of the kernel by\nformal verification. To our knowledge, there does not exist a survey paper on\nthis topic. This paper give an overview to the topic of formal specification\nand verification of the separation kernel. We overview the concept of\nseparation kernel and formal verification, survey the state of the art on the\ntopic after the year 2000, and summarize these works by comparing them and\ndiscussing some issues.","authors":["Yongwang Zhao"],"meta":["August 2015","SourcearXiv"],"references":["304291921_Event-based_Formalization_of_Safety-critical_Operating_System_Standards_An_Experience_Report_on_ARINC_653_using_Event-B","285592141_Evolution_of_the_PikeOS_Microkernel","283043295_Reasoning_About_Information_Flow_Security_of_Separation_Kernels_with_Channel-Based_Communication","267726357_POK_an_ARINC653-compliant_operating_system_released_under_the_BSD_license","313550915_An_Axiomatic_Basis_of_Computer_Programming","295331276_Making_critical_software_safer_Crash-proof_code","290752480_Modeling_and_Security_Analysis_of_a_Commercial_Real-Time_Operating_System_Kernel","289787708_Information_Security_Modeling_and_Analysis","289013682_Formal_Verification_of_Partition_Management_for_the_AAMP7G_Microprocessor","284089040_Specification_language"]}
