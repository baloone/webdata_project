{"id":"348747667_A_co-design_framework_of_neural_networks_and_quantum_circuits_towards_quantum_advantage","abstract":"Despite the pursuit of quantum advantages in various applications, the power of quantum computers in executing neural network has mostly remained unknown, primarily due to a missing tool that effectively designs a neural network suitable for quantum circuit. Here, we present a neural network and quantum circuit co-design framework, namely QuantumFlow, to address the issue. In QuantumFlow, we represent data as unitary matrices to exploit quantum power by encoding n = 2 k inputs into k qubits and representing data as random variables to seamlessly connect layers without measurement. Coupled with a novel algorithm, the cost complexity of the unitary matrices-based neural computation can be reduced from O ( n ) in classical computing to O ( p o l y l o g ( n )) in quantum computing. Results show that on MNIST dataset, QuantumFlow can achieve an accuracy of 94.09% with a cost reduction of 10.85 Ã— against the classical computer. All these results demonstrate the potential for QuantumFlow to achieve the quantum advantage.","authors":["Weiwen Jiang","Jinjun Xiong","Yiyu Shi"],"meta":["January 2021Nature Communications 12(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41467-020-20729-5"],"references":["347454843_Quantum_implementation_of_an_artificial_feed-forward_neural_network","343297901_Hybrid_Quantum-Classical_Neural_Network_for_Calculating_Ground_State_Energies_of_Molecules","338123873_ConvoSource_Radio-Astronomical_Source-Finding_with_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","336744162_Quantum_supremacy_using_a_programmable_superconducting_processor","335976299_Quantum_Computer_Architecture_Towards_Full-Stack_Quantum_Accelerators","348231548_Quantum_computational_advantage_using_photons","346067456_Quantum_Algorithms_for_Feedforward_Neural_Networks","345182628_Hardware_design_and_the_competency_awareness_of_a_neural_network","340517192_HardwareSoftware_Co-Exploration_of_Neural_Architectures","336769519_Accuracy_vs_Efficiency_Achieving_Both_through_FPGA-Implementation_Aware_Neural_Architecture_Search"]}
