{"id":"226399271_Applications_of_Matrix_Algebra_to_Communication_Nets","abstract":"A “generic” problem amenable to matrix algebraic treatment is outlined. Several examples are given and one, a communication\nsystem, is studied in some detail.\n\nA typical structure matrix is used to describe the channels of communication and a “status” matrix is used to describe the\ndistribution of information in the system at any time.\n\nA theorem is proved relating the status matrix at any timet to thetth power of the structure matrix.\n\nThe elements of the communication system are interpreted as individuals who can send messages to each other. For the individuals\nattempting to solve a “group problem” certain relations are derived between the structure and status matrices and time of\nsolution.\n\nThe structure of the communication system is permitted to vary with time. A general theorem is proved relating the status\nmatrix to the matrix product of the series of structure matrices representing the changing structure of the system.\n\nSome suggestions are made for further generalizations. In particular, it is suggested that so-called “higher order” information\ntransmission can be similarly treated.","authors":["Alfonso Shimbel"],"meta":["September 1951Bulletin of Mathematical Biology 13(3):165-178","DOI:10.1007/BF02478225"],"references":["302196660_Sur_le_nombre_des_isomeres_de_certains_composes_chimiques","226604245_Outline_of_a_probabilistic_approach_to_animal_sociology_I","225685854_A_matrix_calculus_for_neural_nets_II","225543812_Outline_of_a_matrix_calculus_for_neural_nets","225446269_On_Dominance_Relations_and_the_Structure_of_Animal_Societies","225116484_Connectivity_and_Generalized_Cliques_in_Sciometric_Group_Structure","24061162_Connectivity_and_generalized_cliques_in_sociometric_group_structure","5707526_Outline_of_a_probabilistic_approach_to_animal_sociology_II","5696089_A_Method_of_Matrix_Analysis_of_Group_Structure"]}
