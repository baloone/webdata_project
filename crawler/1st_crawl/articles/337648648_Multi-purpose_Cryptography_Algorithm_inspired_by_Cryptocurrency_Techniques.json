{"id":"337648648_Multi-purpose_Cryptography_Algorithm_inspired_by_Cryptocurrency_Techniques","abstract":"Cryptography is a technique of securing information and communications through the use of codes so that only those persons for whom the information is intended can understand it and process it. Thus preventing unauthorized access to information. Cryptography is used in different places like banks, hospitals, e-commerce, web pages, and others. We created an efficient multipurpose cryptography algorithm to protect the information, inspired by the actual cryptocurrency algorithms. The objective of the algorithm is to give more protection to places that require to protect their information. We are confident that with the knowledge acquired during the Master of Computer Science and with our previous studies of Robotics and Digital Systems, We can contribute with an important algorithm to this area.","authors":["Cristian Yair Alvarado","Mario Alberto Mendoza Cuevas"],"meta":["November 2019","Project: Multi-purpose Cryptography Algorithm inspired by Cryptocurrency Techniques"],"references":["300908941_7_Uses_of_cryptography","31768973_Cryptography_A_Very_Short_Introduction_F_Piper_S_Murphy"]}
