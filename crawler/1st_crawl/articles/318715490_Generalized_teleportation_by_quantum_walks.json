{"id":"318715490_Generalized_teleportation_by_quantum_walks","abstract":"We develop a generalized teleportation scheme based on quantum walks with two coins. For an unknown qubit state, we use two-step quantum walks on the line and quantum walks on the cycle with four vertices for teleportation. For any d-dimensional states, quantum walks on complete graphs and quantum walks on d-regular graphs can be used for implementing teleportation. Compared with existing d-dimensional states teleportation, prior entangled state is not required and the necessary maximal entanglement resource is generated by the first step of quantum walk. Moreover, two projective measurements with d elements are needed by quantum walks on the complete graph, rather than one joint measurement with \\(d^2\\) basis states. Quantum walks have many applications in quantum computation and quantum simulations. This is the first scheme of realizing communicating protocol with quantum walks, thus opening wider applications.","authors":["Yu Wang","Yun Shang","Peng Xue"],"meta":["July 2017Quantum Information Processing 16(9)","DOI:10.1007/s11128-017-1675-y","Project: quantum walks"],"references":["249317768_Implementing_Quantum_Walks_Using_Orbital_Angular_Momentum_of_Classical_Light","235452547_Implementing_the_quantum_random_walk","228366247_Methodology_for_quantum_logic_gate_construction","221659319_Quantum_walks_A_comprehensive_review","43021814_Photons_Walking_the_Line_A_Quantum_Walk_with_Adjustable_Coin_Operations","235630543_Universal_Computation_by_Multiparticle_Quantum_Walk","230639376_Quantum_Walk_as_a_Generalized_Measuring_Device","45876669_Universal_quantum_computation_using_the_discrete_time_quantum_walk","38082352_Quantum_Walk_on_a_Line_for_a_Trapped_Ion","26284973_Universal_Computation_by_Quantum_Walk"]}
