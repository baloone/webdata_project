{"id":"301248413_Sequential_and_Parallel_Algorithms_for_the_State_Space_Exploration","abstract":"In this article, we are interested in the exploration part of model checking which consists in traversing all the possible states of a system. We propose two approaches to exploration, parallel and sequential. We present a comparison between our parallel approach and the parallel algorithm proposed in SPIN.","authors":["Lamia Allal","Ghalem Belalem","Philippe Dhaussy","Ciprian Teodorov"],"meta":["April 2016Cybernetics and Information Technologies 16(1)","DOI:10.1515/cait-2016-0001","Project: Automatic image annotation"],"references":["285928594_An_Investigation_of_the_Median-Median_Method_of_Linear_Regression","283850356_Projecting_transition_systems_Overcoming_state_explosion_in_concurrent_system_verification","262345386_Parallelizing_the_Spin_Model_Checker","228714978_Towards_Distributed_Verification_of_Petri_Nets_Properties","228691776_A_General_Lock-Free_Algorithm_for_Parallel_State_Space_Construction","304251560_Network_design_with_compression_complexity_and_algorithms","243774218_Maximum_likelihood_linear_regression_speaker_adaptation_of_continuous_density_HMMs","239912082_A_hybrid_approach_to_minimize_state_space_explosion_problem_for_the_solution_of_two_stage_tandem_queues","236023432_The_Model_Checker_-_SPIN","229078317_Maximum_likelihood_linear_regression_for_speaker_adaptation_of_continuous_density_hidden_Markov_models"]}
