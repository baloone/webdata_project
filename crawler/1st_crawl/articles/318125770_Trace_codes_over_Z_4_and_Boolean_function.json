{"id":"318125770_Trace_codes_over_Z_4_and_Boolean_function","abstract":"We construct trace codes over $\\Z_4$ by using Boolean functions and skew sets, respectively. Their Lee weight distribution is studied by using a Galois ring version of the Walsh-Hadamard transform and exponential sums. We obtain a new family of optimal two-weight codes over $\\Z_4.","authors":["Minjia Shi","Yan Liu","Randriam Hugues","Lin Sok"],"meta":["July 2017","Project: Boolean functions over rings"],"references":["272845173_On_the_Griesmer_bound_for_nonlinear_codes","241438519_The_Z_4_Linearity_of_Kerdock_Preparata_Goethals_and_Related_Codes","220334712_Connections_between_Quaternary_and_Binary_Bent_Functions","274012549_Linear_Codes_From_Some_2-Designs","258239682_Bounds_on_the_minimum_distance_of_linear_codes","257554880_Bent_and_generalized_bent_Boolean_functions","238656246_Fundamentals_of_Error-Correcting_Codes","234789335_Handbook_of_Coding_Theory","224105132_A_Bound_for_Error-Correcting_Codes","220537681_An_Expansion_for_the_Coordinates_of_the_Trace_Function_over_Galois_Rings"]}
