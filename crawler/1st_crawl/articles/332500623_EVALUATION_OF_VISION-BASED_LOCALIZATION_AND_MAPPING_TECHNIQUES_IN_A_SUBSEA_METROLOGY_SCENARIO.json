{"id":"332500623_EVALUATION_OF_VISION-BASED_LOCALIZATION_AND_MAPPING_TECHNIQUES_IN_A_SUBSEA_METROLOGY_SCENARIO","abstract":"Metrology is fundamental in all the applications that require to qualify, verify and validate measured data according to standards or, in other words, to assess their compliance with predefined tolerances. At sea, metrology is commonly associated with the process of measuring underwater structures, mainly pipeline elements widely used in offshore industry. Subsea operations are very expensive; optimizing time and money resources are the core factors driving innovation in the subsea metrology industry. In this study, the authors investigate the use of state-of-art vision-based algorithms, i.e. ORB-SLAM2 and Visual Odometry, as a navigation tool to assist and control a Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) while performing subsea metrology operations. In particular, the manuscript will focus on methods for assessing the accuracy of both trajectory and tie points provided by the tested approaches and evaluating whether the preliminary real time reconstruction meets the tolerances defined in typical subsea metrology scenarios.","authors":["Fabio Menna","Alessandro Torresani","Erica Nocerino","Mohamad Motasem Nawaf"],"meta":["April 2019","DOI:10.5194/isprs-archives-XLII-2-W10-127-2019"],"references":["330967533_Real-Time_Monocular_Visual_Odometry_for_Turbid_and_Dynamic_Underwater_Environments","326469728_Fast_Visual_Odometry_for_a_Low-Cost_Underwater_Embedded_Stereo_System","318875066_Comparison_of_the_Selected_State-Of-The-Art_3D_Indoor_Scanning_and_Point_Cloud_Generation_Methods","317969481_Investigation_of_indoor_and_outdoor_performance_of_two_portable_mobile_mapping_systems","317672384_AEKF-SLAM_A_new_algorithm_for_robotic_underwater_navigation","305992077_Towards_Comparison_of_Underwater_SLAM_Methods_An_Open_Dataset_Collection","285597379_Underwater_Photogrammetry_and_Object_Modeling_A_Case_Study_of_Xlendi_Wreck_in_Malta","323299344_Visual_SLAM_and_Structure_from_Motion_in_Dynamic_Environments_A_Survey","319473636_Simultaneous_Localization_And_Mapping_A_Survey_of_Current_Trends_in_Autonomous_Driving","309317476_ORB-SLAM2_an_Open-Source_SLAM_System_for_Monocular_Stereo_and_RGB-D_Cameras"]}
