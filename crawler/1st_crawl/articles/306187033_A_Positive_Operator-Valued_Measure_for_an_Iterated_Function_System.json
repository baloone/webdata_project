{"id":"306187033_A_Positive_Operator-Valued_Measure_for_an_Iterated_Function_System","abstract":"Given an iterated function system (IFS) on a complete and separable metric space $Y$, there exists a unique compact subset $X \\subseteq Y$ satisfying a fixed point relation with respect to the IFS. This subset is called the attractor set, or fractal set, associated to the IFS. The attractor set supports a specific Borel probability measure, called the Hutchinson measure, which itself satisfies a fixed point relation. P. Jorgensen generalized the Hutchinson measure to a projection-valued measure, under the assumption that the IFS does not have essential overlap. In previous work, we developed an alternative approach to proving the existence of this projection-valued measure. The situation when the IFS exhibits essential overlap has been studied by Jorgensen and colleagues. We build off their work to generalize the Hutchinson measure to a positive-operator valued measure for an arbitrary IFS, that may exhibit essential overlap. We also discuss Naimark's dilation theorem with respect to this positive operator-valued measure, and at the beginning of the paper, we prove a metric space completion result regarding the Kantorovich metric.","authors":["Trubee Davison"],"meta":["October 2018Acta Applicandae Mathematicae 157(2â€“3)","DOI:10.1007/s10440-018-0161-6"],"references":["313611886_Fractals_and_self-similarity","284746134_Erratum_to_Generalizing_the_Kantorovich_Metric_to_Projection_Valued_Measures_Acta_Appl_Math_2014_101007s10440-014-9976-y","268610372_Measure_theory_Vol_I_and_II","265370687_A_generalization_of_the_Hutchinson_distance_and_applications","245793633_Convergence_of_Probability_Measures_John_Wiley_New_York_Zbl_17221201","243765747_A_Course_in_Functional_Analysis","239601715_Fractals_and_Self-Similarity","225630549_Completeness_of_the_Space_of_Separable_Measures_in_the_Kantorovich-Rubinshtein_Metric","222518692_A_quantum_computing_primer_for_operator_theorists","222511212_Measures_in_wavelet_decompositions","43454005_Operator_quantum_error_correction","2122378_Use_of_operator_algebras_in_the_analysis_of_measures_from_wavelets_and_iterated_function_systems","2111012_Iterated_function_systems_representations_and_Hilbert_space","2094045_The_Measure_of_a_Measurement","220435984_The_uncertainty_relation_for_joint_measurement_of_postion_and_momentum"]}
