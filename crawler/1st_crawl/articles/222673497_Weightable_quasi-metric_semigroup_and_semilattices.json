{"id":"222673497_Weightable_quasi-metric_semigroup_and_semilattices","abstract":"In [Sch00] a bijection has been established, for the case of semilattices, between invariant partial metrics and semivaluations. Semivaluations are a natural generalization of valuations on lattices to the context of semilattices and arise in many different contexts in Quantitative Domain Theory ([Sch00]). Examples of well known spaces which are semivaluation spaces are the Baire quasi-metric spaces of [Mat95], the complexity spaces of [Sch95] and the interval domain ([EEP97]). In [Sch00a], we have shown that the totally bounded Scott domains of [Smy91] can also be represented as semivaluation spaces.In this extended abstract we explore the notion of a semivaluation space in the context of semigroups. This extension is a natural one, since for each of the above results, an invariant partial metric is involved. The notion of invariance has been well studied for semigroups as well (e.g. [Ko82]).As a further motivation, we discuss three Computer Science examples of semigroups, given by the domain of words ([Smy91]), the complexity spaces ([Sch95],[RS99]) and the interval domain ([EEP97]).An extension of the correspondence theorem of [Sch00] to the context of semigroups is obtained.","authors":["Salvador Romaguera","Michel Schellekens"],"meta":["January 2000Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science 40:347-358","DOI:10.1016/S1571-0661(05)80061-1","SourceCiteSeer"],"references":["277281464_Lattice_Theory","277065078_Probabilistic_Non-Determinism","268041138_Uniform_lattices_II_Order_continuity_and_exhaustivity","268018700_Quasi-Uniform_Spaces","266829381_Uniform_lattices_I_A_generalization_of_topological_Riesz_spaces_and_topological_Boolean_rings","262348269_Totally_bounded_spaces_and_compact_ordered_spaces_as_domains_of_computation","243767060_Algebraic_Theory_of_Lattices","243765773_Valuations_on_continuous_lattices","228766529_Spaces_of_Valuations","227974229_Weighted_Quasi-Metrics"]}
