{"id":"269339553_Upper_Bound_on_Syntactic_Complexity_of_Suffix-Free_Languages","abstract":"We solve an open problem concerning syntactic complexity: We prove that the\ncardinality of the syntactic semigroup of a suffix-free language with $n$ left\nquotients (that is, with state complexity $n$) is at most $(n-1)^{n-2}+n-2$ for\n$n\\ge 7$. Since this bound is known to be reachable, this settles the problem.\nWe also reduce the alphabet of the witness languages reaching this bound to\nfive letters instead of $n+2$, and show that it cannot be any smaller. Finally,\nwe prove that the transition semigroup of a minimal deterministic automaton\naccepting such a witness language is unique for each $n\\ge 7$.","authors":["Janusz Brzozowski","Marek Szyku≈Ça"],"meta":["December 2014","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-19225-3_3","SourcearXiv","Conference: International Workshop on Descriptional Complexity of Formal Systems"],"references":["265889531_Classical_finite_transformation_semigroups_An_introduction","260679346_Upper_Bounds_on_Syntactic_Complexity_of_Left_and_Two-Sided_Ideals","242378722_Handbook_of_Formal_Languages","222837216_State_complexity_of_basic_operations_on_suffix-free_regular_languages","220520656_State_Complexity_of_Regular_Languages","220123109_Languages_Convex_with_Respect_to_Binary_Relations_and_Their_Closure_Properties","50378581_Syntactic_Complexity_of_Prefix-_Suffix-_Bifix-_and_Factor-FreeRegular_Languages","47438215_Syntactic_Complexity_of_Ideal_and_Closed_Languages","41055007_Quotient_Complexity_of_Regular_Languages","31595633_On_the_State_Complexity_of_Reversals_of_Regular_Languages"]}
