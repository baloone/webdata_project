{"id":"228817634_Asynchronous_Multichannel_MAC_Design_With_Difference-Set-Based_Hopping_Sequences","abstract":"Most existing multi-channel medium access control (MAC) protocols have at least one of the follow-ing performance bottlenecks: (1) global synchronization among users, (2) dedicated control channel for signaling exchange, (3) dedicated control phase for signaling ex-change, and (4) complete knowledge of all users' different channel selection strategies. In this paper, we propose a dif-ference set based multi-channel MAC protocol (DSMMAC) which overcomes the above performance bottlenecks. Our proposed protocol achieves high system throughput, low access delay, and good fairness performance, without the need for global synchronization or dedicated control chan-nel/phase. We analyze the performance of our proposed protocol based on a Markove chain model, and show the proposed DSMMAC can achieve up to 100% improvement in system throughput and 150% reduction in channel access delay compared with an existing multi-channel MAC protocol.","authors":["Fen Hou","Lin X.
