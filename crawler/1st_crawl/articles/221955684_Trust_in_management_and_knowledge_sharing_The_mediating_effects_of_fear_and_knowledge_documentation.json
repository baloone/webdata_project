{"id":"221955684_Trust_in_management_and_knowledge_sharing_The_mediating_effects_of_fear_and_knowledge_documentation","abstract":"Knowledge sharing within and between teams is of vital importance for organizations. The influence of interpersonal trust in general and trust in management in particular on knowledge sharing is evident. However, it is not clear how the relationship between interpersonal trust and knowledge sharing works. This study provides a better understanding of that relationship by demonstrating that fear of losing one's unique value and knowledge documentation have a mediating effect on the relationship between trust in management and knowledge sharing. Specifically, trust in management increases knowledge sharing through reducing fear of losing one's unique value and improving willingness to document knowledge. These findings have important implications at both a managerial and theoretical level. For managers, this paper emphasizes the individual's central role in the knowledge sharing process in terms of knowledge documentation and fear of losing one's unique value. On the theoretical level, this study provides empirical evidence for two mechanisms that help explain the effect of trust in management on knowledge sharing. In future research, this study could be extended to include other psychosocial phenomena that enable knowledge sharing in organizations.","authors":["Birgit Renzl"],"meta":["April 2008Omega 36(2):206-220","DOI:10.1016/j.omega.2006.06.005"],"references":["277400499_Knowledge-Sharing_Dilemmas","276053784_Trust_in_Management_and_Performance_Who_Minds_the_Shop_While_the_Employees_Watch_the_Boss","270635074_Motivation_Knowledge_Transfer_and_Organizational_Forms","264416200_Initial_Trust_Formation_in_New_Organizational_Relationships","262252609_Does_Trust_Matter_Exploring_the_Effects_of_Inter-Organizational_and_Inter-Personal_Trust_on_Performance","255662194_Nurturing_Interpersonal_Trust_in_Knowledge-Sharing_Networks","240491298_Fear_of_Exploitation_and_Fear_of_Contamination_Impediments_to_Knowledge_Transfer_in_Mergers_between_Professional_Service_Firms","240279700_The_Impact_of_Team_Atmosphere_on_Knowledge_Outcomes_in_Self-managed_Teams","234021903_Existing_Knowledge_Knowledge_Creation_Capability_and_the_Rate_of_New_Product_Introduction_in_High-Technology_Firms","234021737_Affect-_and_Cognition-Based_Trust_Formations_for_Interpersonal_Cooperation_in_Organizations","232565690_Trust_in_Close_Relationships","232554295_Trust_in_close_relationships_J_Pers_Soc_Psychol","229100915_Toward_A_Knowledge-Based_Theory_of_the_Firm","229099904_Working_Knowledge_How_Organizations_Manage_What_They_Know","228314367_Social_Capital_Intellectual_Capital_and_the_Organizational_Advantage","228314105_Knowledge_of_the_Firm_Combinative_Capabilities_and_the_Replication_of_Technology","228109428_Who_Trusts_Personality_Trust_and_Knowledge_Sharing","284790234_The_role_of_affect-_and_cognition-based_trust_in_complex_knowledge_sharing","284417939_Open_Source_Software_Development_and_the_Private-Collective_Innovation_Model_Issues_for_Organization_Science","277426875_Trust_as_Social_Reality","275697676_Procedural_Justice_Attitudes_and_Subsidiary_Top_Management_Compliance_with_Multinationals'_Corporate_Strategic_Decisions","271817001_Care_in_Knowledge_Creation","270761711_Using_Multivariat_Statistics","260220016_The_Sources_of_Innovation","254661816_The_effects_of_trust_in_leadership_on_employee_performance_behavior_and_attitudes_A_meta-analysis","254660860_Trust_in_Leadership_Meta-Analytic_Findings_and_Implications_for_Organizational_Research","248535033_Analysis_and_study_of_the_impact_of_technology_on_groups_a_conceptual_framework","248390464_The_Strength_of_Weak_Ties","247880713_The_Firm_As_a_Distributed_Knowledge_System_A_Constructionist_Approach","247803790_The_Centrality_of_Interpersonal_Trust_in_Group_Processes","247717442_Learning_Trust_and_Technological_Collaboration","247570187_Do_'High_Commitment'_Human_Resource_Practices_Affect_Employee_Commitment_A_Cross-Level_Analysis_Using_Hierarchical_Linear_Modeling","246915167_Methods_and_concepts_in_management_Significance_satisfaction_and_suggestions_for_further_research-perspectives_from_Germany_Austria_and_Switzerland","243772552_Dynamic_Capabilities_and_Strategic_Management","239646466_The_Concept_of_Ba_Building_a_Foundation_for_Knowledge_Creation","239295005_Goodness-of-fit_indexes_in_confirmatory_factor_analysis_The_effect_of_sample_size","239059712_Knowledge_Knowledge_Work_and_Organizations_An_Overview_and_Interpretation","237202324_Evaluating_Structural_Equation_Models_With_Unobservable_Variable_Sand_Measurement_Error","236982115_Using_Multivarite_Statistics","235360724_Knowledge_Strategy_and_the_Theory_of_the_Firm","234757568_Goodness-of-Fit_Indices_in_Confirmatory_Factor_Analysis_The_Effect_of_Sample_Size","234021932_Exploring_Internal_Stickiness_Impediments_to_the_Transfer_of_Best_Practice_Within_the_Firm","234021735_An_Integrative_Model_Of_Organizational_Trust","234021469_The_Role_of_Trust_in_Organizational_Settings","230276039_The_trusted_general_manager_and_business_unit_performance_Empirical_evidence_of_a_competitive_advantage","228639258_Social_Dilemmas_The_Anatomy_of_Cooperation","228079802_Structural_Equation_Modeling_with_AMOS_Basic_Concepts_Applications_and_Programming_1st_Ed","228079281_Cutoff_Criteria_for_Fit_Indexes_in_Covariance_Structure_Analysis_Conventional_Criteria_Versus_New_Alternatives","227705782_Organizations_as_Rhetoric_Knowledge-Intensive_Firms_and_the_Struggle_with_Ambiguity","227691060_New_Work_Attitude_Measures_of_Trust_Organizational_Commitment_and_Personal_Need_Non-Fulfilment","220534702_The_Strength_of_Weak_Ties_You_Can_Trust_The_Mediating_Role_of_Trust_in_Effective_Knowledge_Transfer","227584244_The_nature_and_structure_of_workers'_trust_in_management","226793619_Goodness_of_fit_in_confirmatory_factor_analysis_The_effects_of_sample_size_and_model_parsimony","222650197_The_communal_resource_and_information_systems","220534884_Work_Groups_Structural_Diversity_and_Knowledge_Sharing_in_a_Global_Organization"]}
