{"id":"325860034_The_effect_of_social_tie_on_information_diffusion_in_complex_networks","abstract":"Social network is an important carrier of information diffusion, and social tie is one of most significant factors between them. To understand the impact of social tie on information dissemination, a dynamical model with social tie strength and self-confirming mechanism is proposed and analyzed in this paper. Theoretical analysis indicates that the equilibrium of the proposed model is globally asymptotically stable, and social tie plays a key role in information propagation. Finally, some numerical simulations under synthetic networks and a partial Facebook network are given to illustrate the main results.","authors":["Yinxue Yi","Zufan Zhang","Chenquan Gan"],"meta":["June 2018Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications 509","DOI:10.1016/j.physa.2018.06.063"],"references":["321060220_Social-aware_D2D_Pairing_for_Cooperative_Video_Transmission_Using_Matching_Theory","316784827_Rumor_propagation_on_networks_with_community_structure"]}
