{"id":"320174738_Subnormal_Distribution_Derived_From_Evolving_Networks_With_Variable_Elements","abstract":"During the past decades, power-law distributions have played a significant role in analyzing the topology of scale-free networks. However, in the observation of degree distributions in practical networks and other nonuniform distributions such as the wealth distribution, we discover that, there exists a peak at the beginning of most real distributions, which cannot be accurately described by a monotonic decreasing power-law distribution. To better describe the real distributions, in this paper, we propose a subnormal distribution derived from evolving networks with variable elements and study its statistical properties for the first time. By utilizing this distribution, we can precisely describe those distributions commonly existing in the real world, e.g., distributions of degree in social networks and personal wealth. Additionally, we fit connectivity in evolving networks and the data observed in the real world by the proposed subnormal distribution, resulting in a better performance of fitness.","authors":["Minyu Feng","Hong Qu","Zhang yi","Juergen Kurths"],"meta":["October 2017IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics PP(99):1-13","DOI:10.1109/TCYB.2017.2751073"],"references":["272184822_Social_significance_of_community_structure_Statistical_view","268151922_Super-star_networks_Growing_optimal_scale-free_networks_via_likelihood","263745870_The_Matthew_effect_in_empirical_data","301941644_Fast_and_Accurate_Mining_the_Community_Structure_Integrating_Center_Locating_and_Membership_Optimization","301233132_Renormalization_group_analysis_of_the_small-world_network_model","286033418_Distributed_finite-time_tracking_of_multiple_non-identical_second-order_nonlinear_systems_with_settling_time_estimation","283617410_Emergence_of_Scaling_in_Random_Networks","277723666_Evolutionary_Model_Selection_and_Parameter_Estimation_for_Protein-Protein_Interaction_Network_Based_on_Differential_Evolution_Algorithm","276067429_Evolving_Scale-Free_Networks_by_Poisson_Process_Modeling_and_Degree_Distribution","266082943_Highest_Degree_Likelihood_Search_Algorithm_Using_a_State_Transition_Matrix_for_Complex_Networks"]}
