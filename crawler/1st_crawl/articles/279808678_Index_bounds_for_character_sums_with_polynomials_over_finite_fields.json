{"id":"279808678_Index_bounds_for_character_sums_with_polynomials_over_finite_fields","abstract":"We provide an index bound for character sums of polynomials over finite\nfields. This improves the Weil bound for high degree polynomials with small\nindices, as well as polynomials with large indices that are generated by\ncyclotomic mappings of small indices. As an application, we also give some\ngeneral bounds for numbers of solutions of some Artin-Schreier equations and\nmininum weights of some cyclic codes.","authors":["Daqing Wan","Wang Qiang"],"meta":["December 2016Designs Codes and Cryptography 81(3)","DOI:10.1007/s10623-015-0170-7","SourcearXiv"],"references":["266002530_Recent_Advances_in_the_Theory_of_Nonlinear_Pseudorandom_Number_Generators","313917015_Orthomorphism_Graphs_of_Groups","312839876_Character_sums_and_coding_theory","306177450_New_bounds_on_cyclic_codes_from_algebraic_curves","298560635_Bounds_of_Gauss_sums_in_finite_fields","275973789_An_Improvement_on_the_Hasse-Weil_Bound_and_applications_to_Character_Sums_Cryptography_and_Coding","268312577_Exponential_sums_in_coding_theory_cryptology_and_algorithms","262245204_Character_sums_and_coding_theory","257481973_Bounds_for_Exponential_Sums_over_Finite_Fields","247678261_Sur_le_Nombre_des_Points_Rationnels_d'une_Courbe_Algebrique_sur_un_Corps_Fini"]}
