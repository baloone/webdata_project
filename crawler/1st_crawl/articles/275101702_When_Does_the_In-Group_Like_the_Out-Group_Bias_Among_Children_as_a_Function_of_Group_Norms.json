{"id":"275101702_When_Does_the_In-Group_Like_the_Out-Group_Bias_Among_Children_as_a_Function_of_Group_Norms","abstract":"Research indicates that in-group favoritism is prevalent among both adults and children. Although research has documented that individuals do not consistently display an in-group bias, the conditions under which out-group preference exists are not well understood. In this study, participants (N = 462) aged 9 to 16 years judged in-group deviant acts that were either in line with or counter to a generic norm shared by both groups. The findings demonstrated, for the first time, that children preferred out-group over in-group deviance only when the in-group peer's deviance was in line with the generic norm and a threat to their group's identity. Participants justified their disapproval of these deviants by focusing on the need for group cohesion and loyalty, while they signified their approval by spotlighting the need for autonomy. Our findings suggest that children's intergroup attitudes are influenced by how the behavior of their peers matches different levels of group norms.\nÂ© The Author(s) 2015.","authors":["Adam Rutland","Aline Hitti","Kelly Lynn Mulvey","Dominic Abrams"],"meta":["April 2015Psychological Science 26(6)","DOI:10.1177/0956797615572758","SourcePubMed"],"references":["285637197_Moral_development_The_social_domain_theory_view","284295468_Promoting_equity_tolerance_and_justice_in_childhood","277575306_Promoting_equity_tolerance_and_justice_Policy_implications","325671599_Adolescents'_Reasoning_about_Exclusion_from_Social_Groups","289963838_Schools_as_developmental_contexts_during_adolescence","286301023_How_Do_Children_Learn_to_Actively_Control_Their_Explicit_Prejudice","284777239_In_navigating_the_social_world_What_infants_children_and_other_species_can_teach_us","277575305_Children_and_Social_Exclusion_Morality_Prejudice_and_Group_Identity","263895179_When_Is_It_Okay_to_Exclude_a_Member_of_the_Ingroup_Children's_and_Adolescents'_Social_Reasoning","261840782_The_Teenage_Brain_Sensitivity_to_Social_Evaluation"]}
