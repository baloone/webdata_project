{"id":"341131685_Safety_and_Automatization_of_Machining_Line","abstract":"the paper deals with problematic of machining lines of machine components for the automotive industry. There is a current issue of increasing labor productivity and economic efficiency of production with full safety of production and environmental protection. Therefore, for a specific practical assignment, the replacement of existing machinery using manual workpiece handling is performed by a fully automated safety-accessible one. For this purpose, an analysis of the technical and operating parameters of the proposed NC machines has been prepared. Attention is paid to optimization of material flow and arrangement of individual workplaces of production machines including handling and transfer of material between individual workplaces. Particular attention is paid to the safety of workers and improves the environmental conditions of the production plant. Finally, the overall efficiency of the proposed solution is evaluated in detail compared to the current solution.","authors":["Ondřej Fíla","Karel Sellner","Daniela Vysloužilová","Dorota Klimecka-Tatar"],"meta":["May 2020","DOI:10.2478/czoto-2020-0033"],"references":["338419196_Economic_Aspects_of_Robotization_of_Production_Processes_by_Example_of_a_Car_Semi-trailers_Manufacturer","336386809_Improvement_of_Manual_Assembly_Line_Based_on_Value_Stream_Mapping_VSM_and_Efectiveness_Coefficient","332101342_The_Machinery_Safety_Management_-_Selected_Issues","319888083_A_4M_Approach_for_a_Comprehensive_Analysis_and_Improvement_of_Manual_Assembly_Lines","282496224_Discussion_on_key_successful_factors_of_TPM_in_enterprises","333950998_A_training_system_for_Industry_40_operators_in_complex_assemblies_based_on_virtual_reality_and_process_mining","332771578_Evaluating_and_Improving_the_Effectiveness_of_Visual_Inspection_of_Products_from_the_Automotive_Industry","332120866_Assembly_process_monitoring_algorithm_using_force_data_and_deformation_data","330487312_The_Robotization_of_Extreme_Automation_The_Balance_Between_Fear_and_Courage","271950998_Industry_40","50600546_Risk_estimation_studies_in_the_context_of_a_machine_control_function","39804356_Nove_cesty_k_vyssi_produktivite_metody_prumysloveho_inzenyrstvi"]}
