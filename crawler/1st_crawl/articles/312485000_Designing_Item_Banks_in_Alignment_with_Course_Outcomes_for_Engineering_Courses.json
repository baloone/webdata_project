{"id":"312485000_Designing_Item_Banks_in_Alignment_with_Course_Outcomes_for_Engineering_Courses","abstract":"A course is defined in terms of its course outcomes, which are statements on what the students should be able to do at the end of the course. Assessment instrument(s) should be designed in a way to measure students' mastery of these course outcomes. Item bank is a collection of assessment items from which specific assessment instruments can be created. Quality of an assessment instrument is ensured if it is generated using an item bank that is created as per the assessment pattern chosen by the instructor. It was observed that structures of existing item banks have several drawbacks. This paper addresses these drawbacks by proposing an approach for designing the structure of a quality item bank and a metadata model compliant to international standards for tagging the items in an item bank. This paper also discusses the design of six item banks consisting of 1000 items each as per the proposed model for six courses which can be used with an online assessment and evaluation tool.","authors":["Shilpi Banerjee","N J Rao","Chandrashekar Ramanathan"],"meta":["December 2016","DOI:10.1109/T4E.2016.039","Conference: 2016 IEEE Eighth International Conference on Technology for Education (T4E)"],"references":["286441219_Rubrics_for_Assessment_Item_Difficulty_in_Engineering_Courses","286440997_An_Approach_to_Automatic_Evaluation_of_Higher_Cognitive_Levels_Assessment_Items","282746541_Design_of_Valid_Summative_Assessment_Instruments_in_Formal_Higher_Education_Programs","260741912_Standardising_Competency_Definitions_for_Engineering_Education","228586751_The_helm_mathematics_learning_and_assessment_regime_for_engineering_students","48353408_Minibix_Item_banking_with_web_services","29812243_Implementation_of_computer_assisted_assessment_Lessons_from_the_literature","28576235_Populating_the_testbank_experiences_within_the_electrical_and_electronic_engineering_curriculum","2956015_Metadata_Standards_for_Educational_Resources","307660768_Putting_interoperability_to_the_test_building_a_large_reusable_assessment_item_bank","276935128_IMS_learning_design_specification_Version_10_final_specification","241625955_SSAC_Computerized_Item_Banking_and_Test_Development_Model","234575356_Item_Banks_What_Where_Why_and_How","220663471_Enhancing_SCORM_metadata_for_assessment_authoring_in_e-Learning","44828922_A_Taxonomy_for_Learning_Teaching_and_Assessing_a_Revision_of_Bloom's_Taxonomy_of_Educational_Objectives","28576220_On-line_formative_assessment_item_banking_and_learning_support"]}
