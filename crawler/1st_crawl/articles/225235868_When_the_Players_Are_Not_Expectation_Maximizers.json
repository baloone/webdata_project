{"id":"225235868_When_the_Players_Are_Not_Expectation_Maximizers","abstract":"Much of Game Theory, including the Nash equilibrium concept, is based on the assumption that players are expectation maximizers. It is known that if players are risk averse, games may no longer have Nash equilibria [11,6]. We show that\n1\nUnder risk aversion (convex risk valuations), and for almost all games, there are no mixed Nash equilibria, and thus either there is a pure equilibrium or there are no equilibria at all, and,\n1\nFor a variety of important valuations other than expectation, it is NP-complete to determine if games between such players have a Nash equilibrium.","authors":["Amos Fiat","Christos Papadimitriou"],"meta":["October 2010","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-16170-4_1","SourceDBLP","Conference: International Symposium on Algorithmic Game Theory"],"references":["222451269_Equilibrium_without_independence","221591740_The_complexity_of_computing_a_Nash_equilibrium","4981428_Developments_in_Non-Expected_Utility_Theory_The_Hunt_for_a_Descriptive_Theory_of_Choice_Under_Risk","4722397_Dynamic_Consistency_and_Non-Expected_Utility_Models_of_Choice_Under_Risk","313007433_Exposition_of_a_New_Theory_on_the_Measurement_of_Risk","312455783_Dynamic_consistency_and_non-expected_utility_models_of_choice_under_uncertainty","279272290_Portfolio_Selection","268971469_The_Theory_of_Play_and_Integral_Equations_with_Skew_Symmetric_Kernels","243772372_Portfolio_Selection_Efficient_Diversi_cation_of_Investment","242930096_The_Limit_Distribution_of_Pure_Strategy_Nash_Equilibria_in_Symmetric_Bimatrix_Games","242504816_The_utility_analysis_of_choices_involving_risk_journal_of_political_economy","233870150_Le_Comportement_de_l'Homme_Rationnel_devant_le_Risque_Critique_des_Postulats_et_Axiomes_de_l'Ecole_Americaine","233822853_The_Theory_of_Games_and_Economic_Behavior","230873253_Non-Cooperative_Games","227357145_A_Simplified_Model_for_Portfolio_Analysis","226584520_Zur_Theorie_der_Gesellschaftsspiele","226265017_Pure-strategy_Equilibria_with_Non-expected_Utility_Players","226251202_On_games_under_expected_utility_with_rank_dependent_probabilities","223058592_On_the_Complexity_of_the_Parity_Argument_and_Other_Inefficient_Proofs_of_Existence","221499828_Settling_the_Complexity_of_Two-Player_Nash_Equilibrium","40932648_Portfolio_Selection_Efficient_Diversification_of_Investment","35553170_Portfolio_selection_efficient_diversification_of_investments","24105989_The_Utility_of_Choice_Involving_Risk","4952531_New_complexity_results_about_Nash_equilibria","4917793_Dynamic_Consistency_Revelations_in_Auctions_and_the_Structure_of_Preferences","4902044_Choice_Under_Uncertainty_Problem_Solved_and_Unsolved","4814288_Prospect_Theory_An_Analysis_of_Decision_Under_Risk","4730895_A_Portfolio_of_Nobel_Laureates_Markowitz_Miller_and_Sharpe","2385103_Nash_Equilibrium_and_the_History_of_Economic_Theory"]}
