{"id":"30764214_On_the_inherent_intractability_of_certain_coding_problems","abstract":"The fact that the general decoding problem for linear codes and the general problem of finding the weights of a linear code are both NP-complete is shown. This strongly suggests, but does not rigorously imply, that no algorithm for either of these problems which runs in polynomial time exists.","authors":["Elwyn R. Berlekamp","Robert J.
