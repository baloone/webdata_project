{"id":"332952276_Profit-Sensitive_Spatial_Scheduling_of_Multi-Application_Tasks_in_Distributed_Green_Clouds","abstract":"An increasing number of organizations choose distributed green data centers (DGDCs) and use their infrastructure resources to deploy and manage multiple applications that flexibly provide services to users around the world in a cost-effective way. The dramatic growth of tasks makes it highly challenging to maximize the total profit of a DGDC provider in a market, where the revenue, price of power grid, solar radiation, wind speed, the maximum amount of energy, on-site air density, and the number of servers in DGDCs all vary with geographical sites. Different from existing studies, this paper designs a profit-sensitive spatial scheduling (PS3) approach to maximize the total profit of a DGDC provider by smartly scheduling all tasks of multiple applications to meet their response time constraints. PS3 can well utilize such spatial diversity of the above factors. In each time slot, the profit maximization for the DGDC provider is formulated as a constrained nonlinear program and solved by the proposed genetic-simulated-annealing-based particle swarm optimization. Real-life trace-driven simulation experiments demonstrate that PS3 realizes higher total profit and throughput than two typical task scheduling methods.","authors":["Haitao Yuan","Jing Bi","Mengchu Zhou"],"meta":["May 2019IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering PP(99):1-10","DOI:10.1109/TASE.2019.2909866"],"references":["326030318_Modified_cuckoo_search_algorithm_to_solve_economic_power_dispatch_optimization_problems","324525629_Forecasting_spot_electricity_prices_Deep_learning_approaches_and_empirical_comparison_of_traditional_algorithms","321065752_Time-_and_Cost-_Efficient_Task_Scheduling_Across_Geo-Distributed_Data_Centers","320463591_Thermal-Aware_and_DVFS-Enabled_Big_Data_Task_Scheduling_for_Data_Centers","320267331_Parallel_Reinforcement_Learning_A_Framework_and_Case_Study","317560905_Metrics_for_Sustainable_Data_Centers","305417395_Linking_Virtual_Machine_Mobility_to_User_Mobility","296481903_Exploiting_Spatio-Temporal_Diversity_for_Water_Saving_in_Geo-Distributed_Data_Centers","282520417_Quantitative_Reasoning_About_Cloud_Security_Using_Service_Level_Agreements","260582188_Energy_and_Performance_Management_of_Green_Data_Centers_A_Profit_Maximization_Approach","249433736_Bat_algorithm_for_constrained_optimization_tasks","221596480_Greening_Geographical_Load_Balancing","220831983_Optimizing_Cost_and_Performance_in_Online_Service_Provider_Networks","220422375_A_View_of_Cloud_Computing","220195289_The_Cost_of_a_Cloud_Research_Problems_in_Data_Center_Networks","323192171_Grid_search_optimization_techniques_for_the_indirect_vector-controlled_induction_motor_drives","322563183_Revenue-sensitive_scheduling_of_multi-application_tasks_in_software-defined_cloud","317291880_Dynamic_VM_Placement_Method_for_Minimizing_Energy_and_Carbon_Cost_in_Geographically_Distributed_Cloud_Data_Centers","310823403_Reactive_Pricing_An_Adaptive_Pricing_Policy_for_Cloud_Providers_to_Maximize_Profit","310739024_Optimizing_Green_Energy_Cost_and_Availability_in_Distributed_Data_Centers","309715993_Online_Auctions_in_IaaS_Clouds_Welfare_and_Profit_Maximization_With_Server_Costs","308384246_Bilateral_Electricity_Trade_Between_Smart_Grids_and_Green_Datacenters_Pricing_Models_and_Performance_Evaluation","307550584_Hierarchical_Approach_for_Efficient_Workload_Management_in_Geo-Distributed_Data_Centers","306006684_A_Fundamental_Tradeoff_Between_Total_and_Brown_Power_Consumption_in_Geographically_Dispersed_Data_Centers","305319720_TTSA_An_Effective_Scheduling_Approach_for_Delay_Bounded_Tasks_in_Hybrid_Clouds","304489936_Search_and_Optimization_by_Metaheuristics","301761006_TRS_Temporal_Request_Scheduling_with_bounded_delay_assurance_in_a_green_cloud_data_center","298727876_Minimum_Dependencies_Energy-Efficient_Scheduling_in_Data_Centers","292711845_Distributed_Online_Scheduling_and_Routing_of_Multicast-Oriented_Tasks_for_Profit-Driven_Cloud_Computing","286562296_An_Efficient_Multi_Queue_Job_Scheduling_for_Cloud_Computing","285630625_Carbon-Aware_Online_Control_of_Geo-Distributed_Cloud_Services","284062799_Cost-aware_request_routing_in_multigeography_cloud_data_centres_using_software-defined_networking","282899715_A_Simulated_Annealing_Global_Maximum_Power_Point_Tracking_Approach_for_PV_Modules_Under_Partial_Shading_Conditions","282432380_Demand_Response_in_Data_Centers_Through_Energy-Efficient_Scheduling_and_Simple_Incentivization","281352589_Exploiting_Renewable_sources_when_Green_SLA_becomes_a_possible_reality_in_Cloud_computing","277929109_CAWSAC_Cost-Aware_Workload_Scheduling_and_Admission_Control_for_Distributed_Cloud_Data_Centers","277580502_Spatio-Temporal_Load_Balancing_for_Energy_Cost_Optimization_in_Distributed_Internet_Data_Centers","277413490_A_Nonnegative_Latent_Factor_Model_for_Large-Scale_Sparse_Matrices_in_Recommender_Systems_via_Alternating_Direction_Method","275381568_Eco-Aware_Online_Power_Management_and_Load_Scheduling_for_Green_Cloud_Datacenters","275130220_Distributed_Generation_Allocation_on_Radial_Distribution_Networks_Under_Uncertainties_of_Load_and_Generation_Using_Genetic_Algorithm","274730382_Profit_Maximization_for_Geographical_Dispersed_Green_Data_Centers","273396199_A_Stackelberg_Game-Based_Optimization_Framework_of_the_Smart_Grid_With_Distributed_PV_Power_Generations_and_Data_Centers","262250548_Achieving_High_Utilization_with_Software-Driven_WAN","258657134_Winding_Changeover_Permanent-Magnet_Generators_for_Renewable_Energy_Applications"]}
