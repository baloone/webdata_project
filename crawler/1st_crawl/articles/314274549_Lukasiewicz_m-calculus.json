{"id":"314274549_Lukasiewicz_m-calculus","abstract":"The paper explores properties of the ukasiewicz μ-calculus, or μ for short, an extension of ukasiewicz logic with scalar multiplication and least and greatest fixed-point operators (for monotone formulas). We observe that μ terms, with n variables, define monotone piece-wise linear functions from [0, 1]ⁿ to [0, 1]. Two effective procedures for calculating the output of μ terms on rational inputs are presented. We then consider the ukasiewicz modal μ-calculus, which is obtained by adding box and diamond modalities to μ. Alternatively, it can be viewed as a generalization of Kozen's modal μ-calculus adapted to probabilistic nondeterministic transition systems (PNTS's). We show how properties expressible in the well-known logic PCTL can be encoded as ukasiewicz modal μ-calculus formulas. We also show that the algorithms for computing values of ukasiewicz μ-calculus terms provide automatic (albeit impractical) methods for verifying ukasiewicz modal μ-calculus properties of finite rational PNTS's.","authors":["Matteo Mio","Alex Simpson"],"meta":["March 2017Fundamenta Informaticae 150(3-4):317-346","DOI:10.3233/FI-2017-1472"],"references":[]}
