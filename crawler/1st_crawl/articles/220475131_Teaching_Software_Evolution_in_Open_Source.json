{"id":"220475131_Teaching_Software_Evolution_in_Open_Source","abstract":"Most software engineering courses require students to develop small programs from scratch, but professional engineers typically work on the evolution of large software systems. Using open source software and a software change process model can narrow this gap without imposing excessive demands on students or instructors.","authors":["Maksym Petrenko","Denys Poshyvanyk","Vaclav Rajlich","Joseph Buchta"],"meta":["November 2007Computer 40(11):25-31","DOI:10.1109/MC.2007.402","SourceDBLP"],"references":["224631033_Pair_Programming_in_Graduate_Software_Engineering_Course_Projects","222531545_A_comparison_of_methods_for_locating_features_in_legacy_software","221368470_Including_Practical_Software_Evolution_in_Software_Engineering_Education","221219711_Combining_Probabilistic_Ranking_and_Latent_Semantic_Indexing_for_Feature_Identification","4200456_Software_engineering_2004_ACMIEEE-CS_guidelines_for_undergraduate_programs_in_software_engineering","4175855_Feature_identification_a_novel_approach_and_a_case_study","4104971_A_case_study_on_regression_test_suite_maintenance_in_system_evolution","4036845_Impact_analysis_and_change_management_of_UML_models","4016726_Evaluating_individual_contribution_toward_group_software_engineering_projects","4016719_Introducing_software_engineering_by_means_of_extreme_programming","3188397_Addendum_to_Locating_features_in_source_code","3188312_Locating_features_in_source_code_IEEE_Trans_Softw_Eng","271528890_Refactoring_Improving_the_Design_of_Existing_Code","247231197_Software_Change_Impact_Analysis","246156132_EXtreme_Programming_EXplained_Addison-Wesley","239583290_Software_engineering_2nd_edition","234774872_Classical_and_Object-Oriented_Software_Engineering_W_Uml_and_C","229871972_Software_reconnaissance_mapping_program_features_to_code_Softw_Maintenance_Res_Pract_749-62","224001128_Extreme_Programming_Explained","221592676_Refactoring_Improving_the_Design_of_Existing_Code","221500840_A_practical_approach_to_re-engineering_software","221308277_IRiSS-a_source_code_exploration_tool","220091835_Incremental_Change_in_Object-Oriented_Programming","34982320_Impact_analysis_and_change_management_of_UML_models_microform","4378129_Software_Change_Impact_Analysis","4270498_The_Role_of_Incremental_Change_in_Agile_Software_Processes","4139411_Static_techniques_for_concept_location_in_object-oriented_code","4139398_JRipples_A_tool_for_program_comprehension_during_incremental_change","4114706_An_information_retrieval_approach_to_concept_location_in_source_code","4009927_A_practical_approach_of_teaching_Software_Engineering","4009926_Teaching_a_software_development_methodology_the_case_of_extreme_programming","3959971_The_role_of_concepts_in_program_comprehension","3929920_CVSSearch_Searching_through_source_code_using_CVS_comments","3892847_Improving_student_performance_in_software_engineering_practice","3852687_Case_study_of_feature_location_using_dependence_graph","3712676_A_model_for_change_propagation_based_on_graph_rewriting","2958433_Software_Engineering","2955338_A_Staged_Model_for_the_Software_Life_Cycle","2874705_Evaluating_Individual_Contribution_Toward_Group_Software_Engineering_Projects"]}
