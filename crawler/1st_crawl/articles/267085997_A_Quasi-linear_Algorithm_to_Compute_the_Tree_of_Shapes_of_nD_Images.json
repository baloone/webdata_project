{"id":"267085997_A_Quasi-linear_Algorithm_to_Compute_the_Tree_of_Shapes_of_nD_Images","abstract":"To compute the morphological self-dual representation of images, namely the tree of shapes, the state-of-the-art algorithms do not have a satisfactory time complexity. Furthermore the proposed algorithms are only effective for 2D images and they are far from being simple to implement. That is really penalizing since a self-dual representation of images is a structure that gives rise to many powerful operators and applications, and that could be very useful for 3D images. In this paper we propose a simple-to-write algorithm to compute the tree of shapes; it works for nD images and has a quasi-linear complexity when data quantization is low, typically 12 bits or less. To get that result, this paper introduces a novel representation of images that has some amazing properties of continuity, while remaining discrete.","authors":["Thierry Géraud","Edwin Carlinet","Sébastien Crozet","Laurent Najman"],"meta":["May 2013","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-38294-9_9","Conference: International Symposium on Mathematical Morphology and Its Applications to Signal and Image Processing"],"references":["267432075_Two_Applications_of_Shape-Based_Morphology_Blood_Vessels_Segmentation_and_a_Generalization_of_Constrained_Connectivity","266939281_Discrete_Set-Valued_Continuity_and_Interpolation","261503042_Context-based_energy_estimator_Application_to_object_segmentation_on_the_tree_of_shapes","321500732_Set-Valued_Analysis","280784668_Digital_imaging_a_unified_topological_framework","267073557_Geometric_Description_of_Images_as_Topographic_Maps","266215708_Morphological_and_Statistical_Techniques_for_the_Analysis_of_3D_Images","242573316_A_Combinatorial_Introduction_to_Topology","239060518_Un_algorithme_optimal_de_ligne_de_partage_des_eaux","233865924_A_fair_comparison_of_many_max-tree_computation_algorithms_Extendedversion_of_the_paper_submitted_to_ISMM_2013"]}
