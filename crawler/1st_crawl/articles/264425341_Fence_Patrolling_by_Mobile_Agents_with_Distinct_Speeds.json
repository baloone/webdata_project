{"id":"264425341_Fence_Patrolling_by_Mobile_Agents_with_Distinct_Speeds","abstract":"Suppose we want to patrol a fence (line segment) using k mobile agents with\ngiven speeds v_1, ..., v_k so that every point on the fence is visited by an\nagent at least once in every unit time period. Czyzowicz et al. conjectured\nthat the maximum length of the fence that can be patrolled is (v_1 + ... +\nv_k)/2, which is achieved by the simple strategy where each agent i moves back\nand forth in a segment of length v_i/2. We disprove this conjecture by a\ncounterexample involving k = 6 agents. We also show that the conjecture is true\nfor k = 2, 3.","authors":["Akitoshi Kawamura","Yusuke Kobayashi"],"meta":["July 2014Distributed Computing 28(2)","DOI:10.1007/s00446-014-0226-3","SourcearXiv"],"references":["267062688_Patrolling_by_Robots_Equipped_with_Visibility","262247399_Optimal_Patrolling_of_Fragmented_Boundaries","259875293_On_Fence_Patrolling_by_Mobile_Agents","226378807_Multi-Robot_Area_Patrol_under_Frequency_Constraints","225802316_Boundary_Patrolling_by_Mobile_Agents_with_Distinct_Maximal_Speeds","224220716_On_Optimal_Cooperative_Patrolling","221456101_A_realistic_model_of_frequency-based_multi-robot_polyline_patrolling","220974593_Recent_Advances_on_Multi-agent_Patrolling","4095288_Theoretical_analysis_of_the_multi-agent_patrolling_problem","262171171_Position_Discovery_for_a_System_of_Bouncing_Robots","236455989_The_Beachcombers'_Problem_Walking_and_Searching_with_Mobile_Robots","225425420_A_Distributed_Ant_Algorithm_forprotect_Efficiently_Patrolling_a_Network","220616615_Distributed_Anonymous_Mobile_Robots_Formation_of_Geometric_Patterns","6528572_Mobile_robotic_sensors_for_perimeter_detection_and_tracking"]}
