{"id":"220895376_Machine_Learning_Techniques_and_Chi-Square_Feature_Selection_for_Cancer_Classification_Using_SAGE_Gene_Expression_Profiles","abstract":"Recently developed Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE) technology enables us to simultaneously quantify the expression\nlevels of tens of thousands of genes in a population of cells. SAGE is better than Microarray in that SAGE can monitor both\nknown and unknown genes while Microarray can only measure known genes. SAGE gene expression profiling based cancer classification \nis a better choice since cancers may be due to some unknown genes. Whereas a wide range of methods has been applied to traditional\nMicroarray based cancer classification, relatively few studies have been done on SAGE based cancer classification. In our\nstudy we evaluate popular machine learning methods (SVM, Naive Bayes, Nearest Neighbor, C4.5 and RIPPER) for classifying cancers\nbased on SAGE data. In order to deal with the high dimensional problem, we propose to use Chi-square for tag/gene selection.\nBoth binary classification and multicategory classification are investigated. The experiments are based on two human SAGE\ndatasets: brain and breast. The results show that SVM and Naive Bayes are the top-performing SAGE classifiers and that Chi-square\nbased gene selection can improve the performance of all the five classifiers investigated.","authors":["Xin Jin","Anbang Xu","Rongfang Bie","Ping Guo"],"meta":["April 2006Lecture Notes in Computer Science 3916:106-115","DOI:10.1007/11691730_11","SourceDBLP","Conference: Data Mining for Biomedical Applications, PAKDD 2006 Workshop, BioDM 2006, Singapore, April 9, 2006, Proceedings"],"references":["221654516_Hierarchical_Cluster_Analysis_of_SAGE_Data_for_Cancer_Profiling","220814591_Noise-Tolerant_Instance-Based_Learning_Algorithms","220515850_A_methodology_for_analyzing_SAGE_libraries_for_cancer_profiling","220343419_Instance-Based_Learning_Algorithms","200110876_Data_Mining_Practical_Machine_Learning_Tools_and_Techniques_with_Java_Implementations","30876208_Data_Mining_-_Practical_Machine_Learning_Tools_and_Techniques_with_JAVA_Implementations","15629121_Serial_Analysis_of_Gene_Expression","12779876_Molecular_classification_of_cancer_class_discovery_and_class_prediction_by_gene_monitoring","10650923_Identifying_tumor_origin_using_a_gene_expression-based_classification_map_Cancer_Res","10585195_A_neural_survival_factor_is_a_candidate_oncogene_in_breast_cancer","8468985_Clustering_analysis_of_SAGE_data_using_a_Poisson_approach","8339368_Statnikov_A_Aliferis_CF_Tsamardinos_I_Hardin_D_Levy_SA_comprehensive_evaluation_of_multicategory_classification_methods_for_microarray_gene_expression_cancer_diagnosis_Bioinformatics_21_631-643","2446719_Improvements_to_Platts_SMO_Algorithm_for_SVM_classifier_design","311450485_Fast_effective_rule_induction","287632969_Learning_to_Filter_Spam_E-Mail_A_Comparison_of_a_Naive_Bayesian_and_a_Memory-Based_Approach","284689114_Classification_of_cancer_Class_discovery_and_class_prediction_by_gene_expression_monitoring","275340906_Random_Forests","271513141_Support_Vector_Networks","246863174_Molecular_Classification_of_Cancer_Cla_ss_Discovery_and_Class_Prediction_by_Gene_Expression","220688794_C45_Programs_for_Machine_Learning","220344030_Gene_Selection_for_Cancer_Classification_Using_Support_Vector_Machines","220316681_An_evaluation_of_statistical_spam_filtering_techniques","38348679_Heuristics_of_Instability_and_Stabilization_in_Model_Selection_The_Annals_of_Statistics_246_2350-2383","2478788_A_Comparison_of_Event_Models_for_Naive_Bayes_Anti-Spam_E-Mail_Filtering","2472137_Fast_Effective_Rule_Induction"]}
