{"id":"319326037_Early_Lessons_from_Evaluation_of_Computer_Science_Teacher_Professional_Development_in_Google's_CS4HS_Program","abstract":"This article compares self-reported learning gains and experiences of teachers in four professional development courses funded through Google's 2014 Computer Science for High School program. The courses were designed and taught independently at four universities and started late enough in the year to participate in our pre-post study. Two of the courses used a face-To-face approach, one was online only, and one used a hybrid format. Analyses from 314 pre-surveys and 129 post-surveys indicate CS teachers are far from homogenous, suggesting that some customization may benefit professional development. We also saw a stronger sense of community in the two face-To-face courses. Among the outcomes we measured, teacher concerns (Hall and Hord 1977) were more sensitive to change than our measures of self-efficacy, outcome expectations, readiness, or beliefs. Findings illustrate the variety of CS teacher professional development experiences and the need to study the best ways to scale effective CS teacher education.","authors":["Jason Ravitz","Chris Stephenson","Karen Parker","Juliane Blazevski"],"meta":["August 2017ACM Transactions on Computing Education 17(4):1-16","DOI:10.1145/3077617","Projects: (Stats) Using Numbers to Learn: Methods, Measurement, Analysis(CS) CS Education & Evaluation"],"references":["301429315_The_network_of_teaching_excellence_in_computer_science_and_master_teachers","281111643_ECAR_Study_of_Undergraduate_Students_and_Information_Technology_2014","276229909_Addressing_the_challenges_of_a_new_digital_technologies_curriculum_MOOCs_as_a_scalable_solution_for_teacher_professional_development","272830766_Knowledge_Instruction_and_Student_Achievement_Distinguishing_Models_of_Professional_Development_The_Case_of_an_Adaptive_Model's_Impact_on_Teachers'_On_behalf_of_American_Association_of_Colleges_for_Te","266212127_Five-Point_Likert_Items_t_Test_Versus_Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon","301429178_Preparing_secondary_computer_science_teachers_through_an_iterative_development_process","290867463_A_Mid-Project_Report_on_a_Statewide_Professional_Development_Model_for_CS_Principles","285831994_Self-Efficacy_The_Exercise_of_Control","273213891_Self-Assessment_of_Knowledge_A_Cognitive_Learning_or_Affective_Measure","271439206_Opening_the_door_of_the_computer_science_classroom"]}
