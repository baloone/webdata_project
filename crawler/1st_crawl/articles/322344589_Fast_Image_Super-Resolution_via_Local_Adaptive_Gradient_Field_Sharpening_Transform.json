{"id":"322344589_Fast_Image_Super-Resolution_via_Local_Adaptive_Gradient_Field_Sharpening_Transform","abstract":"This paper proposes a single-image super-resolution scheme by introducing a gradient field sharpening transform that converts the blurry gradient field of upsampled low-resolution (LR) image to a much sharper gradient field of original highresolution (HR) image. Different from the existing methods that need to figure out the whole gradient profile structure and locate the edge points, we derive a new approach that sharpens the gradient field adaptively only based on the pixels in a small neighborhood. To maintain image contrast, image gradient is adaptively scaled to keep the integral of gradient field stable. Finally the HR image is reconstructed by fusing the LR image with the sharpened HR gradient field. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can generate more accurate gradient field and produce super-resolved images with better objective and visual qualities. Another advantage is that the proposed gradient sharpening transform is very fast and suitable for low-complexity applications.","authors":["Qiang Song","Ruiqin Xiong","Dong Liu","Zhiwei Xiong"],"meta":["January 2018IEEE Transactions on Image Processing PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TIP.2017.2789323"],"references":["319284647_NTIRE_2017_Challenge_on_Single_Image_Super-Resolution_Methods_and_Results","318337451_Enhanced_Deep_Residual_Networks_for_Single_Image_Super-Resolution","316045799_Deep_Laplacian_Pyramid_Networks_for_Fast_and_Accurate_Super-Resolution","284097354_Accurate_Image_Super-Resolution_Using_Very_Deep_Convolutional_Networks","284097296_Deeply-Recursive_Convolutional_Network_for_Image_Super-Resolution","275523282_Single_Image_Super-resolution_from_Transformed_Self-Exemplars","270454670_Image_Super-Resolution_Using_Deep_Convolutional_Networks","264552416_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","260421625_Single_Image_Super-resolution_With_Detail_Enhancement_Based_on_Local_Fractal_Analysis_of_Gradient","248705623_Fast_Acquisition_and_Reconstruction_of_Optical_Coherence_Tomography_Images_via_Sparse_Representation","230604847_Image_Super-Resolution_by_TV-Regularization_and_Bregman_Iteration","224236682_Image_Interpolation_Via_Regularized_Local_Linear_Regression","319770198_Learning_a_Deep_Convolutional_Network_for_Image_Super-Resolution","319283981_Image_Super_Resolution_Based_on_Fusing_Multiple_Convolution_Neural_Networks","319277381_Enhanced_Deep_Residual_Networks_for_Single_Image_Super-Resolution","319277228_Balanced_Two-Stage_Residual_Networks_for_Image_Super-Resolution","319277067_Exploiting_Reflectional_and_Rotational_Invariance_in_Single_Image_Superresolution","311610731_Accurate_Image_Super-Resolution_Using_Very_Deep_Convolutional_Networks","309416484_Single_Image_Super-Resolution_via_Adaptive_High-Dimensional_Non-Local_Total_Variation_and_Adaptive_Geometric_Feature","309080068_Image_Denoising_via_Bandwise_Adaptive_Modeling_and_Regularization_Exploiting_Nonlocal_Similarity","308852884_Fast_and_accurate_image_upscaling_with_super-resolution_forests","308728004_Edge_guided_single_depth_image_super_resolution","308549129_Segmentation_Based_Sparse_Reconstruction_of_Optical_Coherence_Tomography_Images","307895539_Super-resolution_through_neighbor_embedding","307538959_Single_image_superresolution_based_on_gradient_profile_sharpness","305037517_Single_Image_Super_Resolution_using_a_Joint_GMM_Method","305037438_Low-Rank_Decomposition_Based_Restoration_of_Compressed_Images_via_Adaptive_Noise_Estimation","303821507_RAISR_Rapid_and_Accurate_Image_Super_Resolution","302056344_Robust_Single_Image_Super-Resolution_via_Deep_Networks_With_Sparse_Prior","301571855_Non-Local_Gradient_Sparsity_Regularization_for_Image_Restoration","300412657_Deep_Networks_for_Image_Super-Resolution_with_Sparse_Prior","300412580_Convolutional_Sparse_Coding_for_Image_Super-Resolution","289685038_CONCOLOR_constrained_non-convex_low-rank_model_for_image_deblocking","288640908_A_Adjusted_Anchored_Neighborhood_Regression_for_Fast_Super-Resolution","288020769_Single-Image_Super-Resolution_Using_Active-Sampling_Gaussian_Process_Regression","284829635_Image_and_video_upscaling_from_local_self-examples","284274253_Edge-Guided_Single_Depth_Image_Super_Resolution","280116743_High_Resolution_Local_Structure_Constrained_Image_Upsampling","273397451_Fast_Image_Upsampling_via_the_Displacement_Field","273158376_Learning_Super-Resolution_Jointly_From_External_and_Internal_Examples","271551258_Super-resolution_via_Transform-Invariant_Group-Sparse_Regularization","262323537_Anchored_Neighborhood_Regression_for_Fast_Example-Based_Super-Resolution","262226002_A_Statistical_Prediction_Model_Based_on_Sparse_Representations_for_Single_Image_Super-Resolution","261479296_Beta_Process_Joint_Dictionary_Learning_for_Coupled_Feature_Spaces_with_Application_to_Single_Image_Super-Resolution","260665429_Edge-Directed_Single-Image_Super-Resolution_Via_Adaptive_Gradient_Magnitude_Self-Interpolation","240017331_Generic_Image_Hallucination_with_Primal_Sketch_Prior","234123917_Sparse_Representation_Based_Image_Interpolation_With_Nonlocal_Autoregressive_Modeling","230565669_Single_Image_Super-Resolution_With_Non-Local_Means_and_Steering_Kernel_Regression","224227390_Real-Time_Artifact-Free_Image_Upscaling","224215058_Image_Deblurring_and_Super-Resolution_by_Adaptive_Sparse_Domain_Selection_and_Adaptive_Regularization","224138603_Image_Super-Resolution_Via_Sparse_Representation","224135979_Super-Resolution_from_a_Single_Image","221696851_Image_Super-Resolution_With_Sparse_Neighbor_Embedding","220942248_On_Single_Image_Scale-Up_Using_Sparse-Representations","224164286_Super_Resolution_using_Edge_Prior_and_Single_Image_Detail_Synthesis"]}
