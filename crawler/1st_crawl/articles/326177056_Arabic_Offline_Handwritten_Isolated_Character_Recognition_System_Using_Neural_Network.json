{"id":"326177056_Arabic_Offline_Handwritten_Isolated_Character_Recognition_System_Using_Neural_Network","abstract":"Arabic language has been one of the major languages that have little attention in this field of research by Arab researchers in particular and foreign researchers in general. Due to the highly cursive nature of handwritten Arabic language, it considered one of the most challenging problems in contrast to working with Latin, Japanese or Chines character recognition. Optical Character Recognition has been an active research field, and still one of the most challenging, and dynamic areas of research in computer science. In this paper we proposed Arabic off-line isolated character handwritten recognition system based on novel feature extraction techniques and MLP neural network as classification engine, the presented work is implemented and tested via CENPARMI database. Competitive recognition accuracy reached up to (94.75%) has been achieved. This result motivate us and other researches in this field to employ the features extraction techniques that we have used in this research with other Arabic character shapes.","authors":["Ahmed Subhi Abdalkafor","Sadeq O Alhamouz"],"meta":["December 2016"],"references":["284545693_A_Survey_on_Arabic_Character_Recognition","283553240_Handwritten_Arabic_Characters_Recognition_Using_Methods_Based_on_Racah_Gegenbauer_Hahn_Tchebychev_and_Orthogonal_Fourier-Mellin_Moments","283310923_Investigating_of_Preprocessing_Techniques_and_Novel_Features_in_Recognition_of_Handwritten_Arabic_Characters","281441384_OFF-LINE_ARABIC_HANDWRITTEN_ISOLATED_CHARACTER_RECOGNITION","276848309_Comparative_systems_of_handwriting_Arabic_character_recognition","260511140_A_Proposed_OCR_Algorithm_for_the_Recognition_of_Handwritten_Arabic_Characters","228786329_Handwritten_Amazigh_Character_Recognition_Based_On_Hidden_Markov_Models","261429543_Recognition_Techniques_for_Online_Arabic_Handwriting_Recognition_Systems","221156743_Off-Line_Arabic_Handwritten_Characters_Recognition_Based_on_a_Hidden_Markov_Models","220483777_A_feature_extraction_technique_based_on_character_geometry_for_character_recognition"]}
