{"id":"279458743_The_Multi-strand_Graph_for_a_PTZ_Tracker","abstract":"High-resolution images can be used to resolve matching ambiguities between\ntrajectory fragments (tracklets), which is one of the main challenges in\nmultiple target tracking. A PTZ camera, which can pan, tilt and zoom, is a\npowerful and efficient tool that offers both close-up views and wide area\ncoverage on demand. The wide-area view makes it possible to track many targets\nwhile the close-up view allows individuals to be identified from\nhigh-resolution images of their faces. A central component of a PTZ tracking\nsystem is a scheduling algorithm that determines which target to zoom in on.\nIn this paper we study this scheduling problem from a theoretical\nperspective, where the high resolution images are also used for tracklet\nmatching. We propose a novel data structure, the Multi-Strand Tracking Graph\n(MSG), which represents the set of tracklets computed by a tracker and the\npossible associations between them. The MSG allows efficient scheduling as well\nas resolving -- directly or by elimination -- matching ambiguities between\ntracklets. The main feature of the MSG is the auxiliary data saved in each\nvertex, which allows efficient computation while avoiding time-consuming graph\ntraversal. Synthetic data simulations are used to evaluate our scheduling\nalgorithm and to demonstrate its superiority over a na\\\"ive one.","authors":["Shachaf Melman","Yael Moses","GÃ©rard G.
