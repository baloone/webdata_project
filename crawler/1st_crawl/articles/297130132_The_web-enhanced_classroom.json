{"id":"297130132_The_web-enhanced_classroom","abstract":"The four fundamental components to successfully web-enhance a course are discussed. A combination of online and traditional classroom instruction is the most popular way to use Internet teaching and learning tools. It is observed that students with access to both traditional lectures and an online environment fair better academically than students instructed entirely in the traditional classroom or by the Internet. The four components are administration, assessment, content and community and each component can be incorporated to a course to enhance student learning in various ways.","authors":["K.
