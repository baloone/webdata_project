{"id":"312437466_An_Efficient_Quantum_Somewhat_Homomorphic_Symmetric_Searchable_Encryption","abstract":"In 2009, Gentry first introduced an ideal lattices fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) scheme. Later, based on the approximate greatest common divisor problem, learning with errors problem or learning with errors over rings problem, FHE has developed rapidly, along with the low efficiency and computational security. Combined with quantum mechanics, Liang proposed a symmetric quantum somewhat homomorphic encryption (QSHE) scheme based on quantum one-time pad, which is unconditional security. And it was converted to a quantum fully homomorphic encryption scheme, whose evaluation algorithm is based on the secret key. Compared with Liang’s QSHE scheme, we propose a more efficient QSHE scheme for classical input states with perfect security, which is used to encrypt the classical message, and the secret key is not required in the evaluation algorithm. Furthermore, an efficient symmetric searchable encryption (SSE) scheme is constructed based on our QSHE scheme. SSE is important in the cloud storage, which allows users to offload search queries to the untrusted cloud. Then the cloud is responsible for returning encrypted files that match search queries (also encrypted), which protects users’ privacy.","authors":["Xiaoqiang Sun","Ting Wang","Zhiwei Sun","Ping Wang"],"meta":["April 2017International Journal of Theoretical Physics 56(4)","DOI:10.1007/s10773-017-3275-0"],"references":["301879111_Quantum_homomorphic_encryption_for_polynomial-size_circuits","268525365_A_quantum_approach_to_homomorphic_encryption","325246763_Efficient_Fully_Homomorphic_Encryption_from_Standard_LWE","305719390_Toward_Efficient_Multi-Keyword_Fuzzy_Search_Over_Encrypted_Outsourced_Data_With_Accuracy_Improvement","305472505_Quantum_Homomorphic_Encryption_for_Polynomial-Sized_Circuits","280773270_Quantum_homomorphic_encryption_from_quantum_codes","276368901_A_Secure_and_Dynamic_Multi-Keyword_Ranked_Search_Scheme_over_Encrypted_Cloud_Data","270287377_Quantum_Homomorphic_Encryption_for_Circuits_of_Low_T-gate_Complexity","267441252_Homomorphic_Encryption_from_Learning_with_Errors_Conceptually-Simpler_Asymptotically-Faster_Attribute-Based","265187089_Fully_Homomorphic_Encryption_without_Modulus_Switching_from_Classical_GapSVP","259118668_Efficient_fully_homomorphic_encryption_from_RLWE_with_an_extension_to_a_threshold_encryption_scheme","257688095_A_blind_quantum_signature_protocol_using_the_GHZ_states","257641752_Efficient_and_feasible_quantum_private_comparison_of_equality_against_the_collective_amplitude_damping_noise","245013680_A_public_key_cyryptosystem_and_signature_scheme_based_on_discrete_logarithms","242584149_On_Data_Banks_and_Privacy_Homomorphisms"]}
