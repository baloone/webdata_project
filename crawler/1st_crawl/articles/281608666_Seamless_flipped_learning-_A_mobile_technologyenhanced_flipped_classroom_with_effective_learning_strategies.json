{"id":"281608666_Seamless_flipped_learning-_A_mobile_technologyenhanced_flipped_classroom_with_effective_learning_strategies","abstract":"The flipped classroom has been recognized by educators as an innovative and effective instructional approach. It totally overthrows traditional instruction by switching in-class instruction time with at-home practicing time. While the effectiveness of the flipped room has been identified, the challenges of applying it to school settings have also been pointed out, such as the need for effective in-class learning designs and the necessity of helping students learn across at-home and in-school contexts. In this paper, the challenges as well as the definition, characteristics, and educational objectives of flipped learning are introduced; moreover, the seamless flipped learning model is proposed by integrating the features of mobile and wireless communication technologies into the flipped classroom model to provide a guide for researchers and educators to develop effective flipped learning activities and plans for helping students learn seamlessly across contexts.","authors":["Gwo-Jen Hwang","Chiu-Lin Lai","Siang-Yi Wang"],"meta":["December 2015Journal of Computers in Education 2(4)","DOI:10.1007/s40692-015-0043-0"],"references":["291342445_Mindtool-Assisted_In-Field_Learning_MAIL_An_Advanced_Ubiquitous_Learning_Project_in_Taiwan","286322641_A_cognitive_apprenticeship_approach_to_facilitating_web-based_collaborative_problem_solving","286186694_Implementing_Mobile_Learning_Curricula_in_Schools_A_Programme_of_Research_from_Innovation_to_Scaling","286134911_An_electronic_library-based_learning_environment_for_supporting_web-based_problem-solving_activities","286044876_A_project-based_digital_storytelling_approach_for_improving_students'_learning_motivation_problem-solving_competence_and_learning_achievement","285935974_The_flipped_classroom_A_survey_of_the_research","314115125_Creative_cognition_Theory_research_and_applications","299846140_Technology_Integration_and_the_Flipped_Classroom","291817236_Analysis_of_attributes_of_mobile_learning_activities_Two_case_studies_of_m-learning_design","287104845_The_Flipped_Classroom_Online_instruction_at_home_frees_class_time_for_learning"]}
