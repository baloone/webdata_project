{"id":"283336890_Cloud_Computing_Adoption_Framework-a_security_framework_for_business_clouds","abstract":"This article presents a cloud computing adoption framework (CCAF) security suitable for business clouds. CCAF multilayered security is based on the development and integration of three major security technologies: firewall, identity management, and encryption based on the development of enterprise file sync and share technologies. This article presents the vision, related works, and views on security framework. Core technologies have been explained in detail, and experiments were designed to demonstrate the robustness of the CCAF multilayered security. In penetration testing, CCAF multilayered security could detect and block 99.95% viruses and trojans, and could achieve of blocking for 100 h of continuous attack. Detection and blocking took /trojan or virus. A full CCAF multilayered security protection could block all SQL (structured query language) injection, providing real protection to data. CCAF multilayered security did not report any false alarm. All -measures for CCAF test results were . The mechanism of blending of CCAF multilayered security with policy, real services, and business activities has been illustrated. Research contributions have been justified and CCAF multilayered security can be beneficial for volume, velocity, and veracity of big data services operated in the cloud.","authors":["Victor Chang","Yen-Hung Kuo","Muthu Ramachandran"],"meta":["October 2015Future Generation Computer Systems 57","DOI:10.1016/j.future.2015.09.031","Project: Requirements Engineering for Service and Cloud Computing"],"references":["220985690_TrustCloud_A_Framework_for_Accountability_and_Trust_in_Cloud_Computing","220415613_Scalable_SQL_and_NoSQL_data_stores","38003076_Automatic_Creation_of_SQL_Injection_and_Cross-Site_Scripting_Attacks","4243822_A_security_framework_for_wireless_sensor_networks","328730668_The_Business_Value_of_IT_Managing_Risks_Optimizing_Performance_and_Measuring_Results","290096952_Cloud_Storage_and_Bioinformatics_in_a_Private_Cloud_Deployment_Lessons_for_Data_Intensive_Research","283709834_Towards_Achieving_Data_Security_with_the_Cloud_Computing_Adoption_Framework","274573436_Assessing_and_Comparing_Vulnerability_Detection_Tools_for_Web_Services_Benchmarking_Approach_and_Examples","261051077_A_Hybrid_Cloud_Storage_Architecture_for_Service_Operational_High_Availability","225400255_Cascade_ciphers_The_importance_of_being_first","222675501_Kavitha_V_A_Survey_on_Security_Issues_in_Service_Delivery_Models_of_Cloud_Computing_Journal_of_Network_and_Computer_Application_341_1-11","221177320_Cloud_Computing_-_The_Business_Perspective","221028332_SecureCloud_Towards_a_Comprehensive_Security_Framework_for_Cloud_Computing_Environments","220593603_Toward_a_Usage-Based_Security_Framework_for_Collaborative_Computing_Systems","42804556_Segmenting_Histogram-based_Robust_Audio_Watermarking_Approach","4355205_On_the_Security_of_Public_Key_Protocols","3083804_On_the_Security_of_Public_Key_Protocols_IEEE_Transactions_on_Information_Theory_292_198-208"]}
