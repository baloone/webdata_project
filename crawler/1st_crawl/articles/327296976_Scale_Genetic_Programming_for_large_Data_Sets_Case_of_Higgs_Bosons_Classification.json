{"id":"327296976_Scale_Genetic_Programming_for_large_Data_Sets_Case_of_Higgs_Bosons_Classification","abstract":"Extract knowledge and significant information from very large data sets is a main topic in Data Science, bringing the interest of\nresearchers in machine learning field. Several machine learning techniques have proven eï¿½ective to deal with massive data like Deep\nNeuronal Networks. Evolutionary algorithms are considered not well suitable for such problems because of their relatively high\ncomputational cost. This work is an attempt to prove that, with some extensions, evolutionary algorithms could be an interesting\nsolution to learn from very large data sets. We propose the use of the Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP) as meta-heuristic\napproach to learn from the Higgs big data set. CGP is extended with an active sampling technique in order to help the algorithm\nto deal with the mass of the provided data. The proposed method is able to take up the challenge of dealing with the complete\nbenchmark data set of 11 million events and produces satisfactory preliminary results.","authors":["Hmida Hmida","Sana Ben Hamida","Amel Borgi","Marta Rukoz"],"meta":["January 2018Procedia Computer Science 126:302-311","DOI:10.1016/j.procs.2018.07.264","Project: Evolutionary Algorithms as machine learning methods for massive data"],"references":["311842563_Stacking_machine_learning_classifiers_to_identify_Higgs_bosons_at_the_LHC","308942284_Sampling_Methods_in_Genetic_Programming_Learners_from_Large_Datasets_A_Comparative_Study","281947314_The_Higgs_Machine_Learning_Challenge","263704884_Searching_for_Exotic_Particles_in_High-Energy_Physics_with_Deep_Learning","221009401_A_Comparison_of_Cartesian_Genetic_Programming_and_Linear_Genetic_Programming","312551529_Higgs_boson_discovery_with_boosted_trees","308849250_Evaluation_of_Machine_Learning_Frameworks_on_Bank_Marketing_and_Higgs_Datasets","280855980_Learning_to_discover_the_Higgs_boson_machine_learning_challenge","274394422_Enhanced_Higgs_Boson_to_tt-_Search_with_Deep_Learning","249849213_Dynamic_subset_selection_based_on_a_tness_case_topology_preprint"]}
