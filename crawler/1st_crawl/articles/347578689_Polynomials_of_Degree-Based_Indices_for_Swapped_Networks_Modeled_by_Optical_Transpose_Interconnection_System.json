{"id":"347578689_Polynomials_of_Degree-Based_Indices_for_Swapped_Networks_Modeled_by_Optical_Transpose_Interconnection_System","abstract":"The Optical Transpose Interconnection System (OTIS) has applications in parallel processing, distributed processing, routing, and networks. It is used for efficient usage of multiple parallel algorithms or parallel systems, with different global interconnections in a network as it is an optoelectronic (combination of light signals and electronics). In chemical graph theory, topological indices are used to study characteristics of the chemical structures or biological activities. Topological indices are sometimes studied with the assistance to their polynomial. In this article, polynomials of degree-based topological indices for OTIS and swapped networks have been studied. Results can be used to compute any degree-based topological polynomials for OTIS swapped network.","authors":["Ali Ahmad","Roslan Hasni","Kashif Elahi","Muhammad Ahsan Asim"],"meta":["January 2020IEEE Access 8:214293-214299","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3039298"],"references":["346036095_On_Topological_Indices_for_Swapped_Networks_Modeled_by_Optical_Transpose_Interconnection_System","340486206_Degree-Based_Topological_Invariants_Of_Metal-Organic_Networks","318567085_M-polynomials_and_topological_indices_of_silicate_and_oxide_networks","318156714_On_the_Certain_Topological_Indices_of_Titania_Nanotube_TiO2m_n","311972061_Some_Algebraic_Polynomials_and_Topological_Indices_of_Generalized_Prism_and_Toroidal_Polyhex_Networks","331833712_Polynomials_of_degree-based_indices_for_hexagonal_nanotubes","320289891_Degree-based_topological_indices_of_hexagonal_nanotubes","319488981_Computation_of_certain_topological_properties_of_para-line_graph_of_honeycomb_networks_and_graphene","317281039_On_the_degree_based_topological_indices_of_benzene_ring_embedded_in_P-type-surface_in_2D_network","310741151_Topological_indices_of_rhombus_type_silicate_and_oxide_networks"]}
