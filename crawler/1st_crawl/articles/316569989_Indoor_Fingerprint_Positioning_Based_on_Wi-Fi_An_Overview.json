{"id":"316569989_Indoor_Fingerprint_Positioning_Based_on_Wi-Fi_An_Overview","abstract":"The widely applied location-based services require a high standard for positioning technology. Currently, outdoor positioning has been a great success; however, indoor positioning technologies are in the early stages of development. Therefore, this paper provides an overview of indoor fingerprint positioning based on Wi-Fi. First, some indoor positioning technologies, especially the Wi-Fi fingerprint indoor positioning technology, are introduced and discussed. Second, some evaluation metrics and influence factors of indoor fingerprint positioning technologies based onWi-Fi are introduced. Third, methods and algorithms of fingerprint indoor positioning technologies are analyzed, classified, and discussed. Fourth, some widely used assistive positioning technologies are described. Finally, conclusions are drawn and future possible research interests are discussed. It is hoped that this research will serve as a stepping stone for those interested in advancing indoor positioning.","authors":["Shixiong Xia","Yi Liu","Guan Yuan","Mingjun Zhu"],"meta":["April 2017International Journal of Geo-Information 6(5):135","DOI:10.3390/ijgi6050135","Project: Moving Object Data Mining"],"references":["314650379_The_Smartphone-Based_Offline_Indoor_Location_Competition_at_IPIN_2016_Analysis_and_Future_Work","310500732_Design_of_RSSI_based_fingerprinting_with_reduced_quantization_measures","314136451_Low-Effort_Place_Recognition_with_WiFi_Fingerprints_Using_Deep_Learning","313886176_A_realistic_evaluation_of_indoor_positioning_systems_based_on_Wi-Fi_fingerprinting_The_2015_EvAAL-ETRI_competition","313714765_Indoor_localization_system_using_RSSI_measurement_of_wireless_sensor_network_based_on_ZigBee_standard","310500948_An_improved_RSSI_of_geomagnetic_field-based_indoor_positioning_method_involving_efficient_database_generation_by_building_materials","310500333_Smallest_enclosing_circle-based_fingerprint_clustering_and_modified-WKNN_matching_algorithm_for_indoor_positioning","310498653_Domain_clustering_based_WiFi_indoor_positioning_algorithm","310497728_Positioning_using_ambient_magnetic_fields_in_combination_with_Wi-Fi_and_RFID","310496750_Position_error_and_entropy_of_probabilistic_Wi-Fi_fingerprinting_in_the_UJIIndoorLoc_dataset"]}
