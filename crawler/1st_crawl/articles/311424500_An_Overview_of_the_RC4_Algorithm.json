{"id":"311424500_An_Overview_of_the_RC4_Algorithm","abstract":"File security is critical in maintaining the confidentiality of the information, especially sensitive information that should only be known by authorized persons only. If the data is not kept secret, the information obtained may lead to undesirable events and misused by parties who are not responsible.The best way is used for file security is cryptography. One of the algorithms used is RC4. In the process of this algorithm, the key generated by forming the S-Box. The results of the S-Box then is carried out by XOR process with the existing plain character. This study discusses how to perform encryption and decryption process uses the RC4 algorithm to each of the ASCII file.","authors":["Isnar Sumartono","Andysah Putera Utama Siahaan","Nova Mayasari"],"meta":["December 2016IOSR Journal of Dental and Medical Sciences 18(6):2278-661","DOI:10.9790/0661-1806046773"],"references":["309464474_Blum_Blum_Shub_in_Generating_Key_in_RC4","305268410_RC4_Technique_in_Visual_Cryptography_RGB_Image_Encryption","283005916_A_Survey_on_RC4_Stream_Cipher","275605075_RC4_stream_cipher_and_possible_attacks_on_WEP","258651886_Analysis_of_a_Modified_RC4_Algorithm","272863700_Enhancing_Security_of_Improved_RC4_Stream_Cipher_by_Converting_into_Product_Cipher"]}
