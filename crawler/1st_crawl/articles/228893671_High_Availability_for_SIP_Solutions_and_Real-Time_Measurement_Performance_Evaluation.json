{"id":"228893671_High_Availability_for_SIP_Solutions_and_Real-Time_Measurement_Performance_Evaluation","abstract":"SIP is rapidly becoming a standard for service integration within a variety of wireless and wireline networks. In this regard high availability, reliability and redundancy are key factors for any SIP based infrastructure. In an adverse environment, especially the Internet and foreseeable 3GPP IMS, high availability solutions are of major importance for SIP network components to smoothly mitigate call increments, device failures, misconfigurations, physical disasters and throttle active attacks. This paper proposes a practical and transparent failover solution for SIP and RTP-Proxy servers. We demonstrate that both methods work properly and increase stability and availability of such systems. Furthermore, high availability solutions are enhanced through the employment of easy to implement load balancing schemes. All the proposed solutions are technically analyzed and evaluated via properly designed test-beds, showing fine performance in terms of service times.","authors":["Georgios Kambourakis","Dimitris Geneiatakis","Stefanos Gritzalis","Costas Lambrinoudakis"],"meta":["March 2010"],"references":["247932887_The_naming_authority_pointer_NAPTR_DNS_resource_record","244955419_A_DNS_RR_for_specifying_the_location_of_services","244440797_RFC_3261SIP_Session_initiation_protocol","241845897_DNS-based_Mechanism_for_Policy-added_Server_Selection","239581197_DNS_support_for_load_balancing","238652622_Assessment_of_VoIP_Service_Availability_in_the_Current_Internet","237834714_Towards_effective_SIP_load_Balancing","234828232_The_Secure_Real-time_Transport_Protocol_SRTP","223014655_Network_Dispatcher_a_connection_router_for_scalable_Internet_services","222662558_Two_layer_Denial_of_Service_prevention_on_SIP_VoIP_infrastructures","222517595_Failover_load_sharing_and_server_architecture_in_SIP_telephony","221303414_Efficient_Support_for_Content-based_Routing_in_Web_Server_Clusters","222503933_ONE-IP_Techniques_for_Hosting_a_Service_on_a_Cluster_of_Machines","221459159_Scheduling_Algorithms_for_Distributed_Web_Servers","221303395_Why_Do_Internet_Services_Fail_and_What_Can_Be_Done_About_It"]}
