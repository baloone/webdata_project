{"id":"346016950_Conversion_of_Deterministic_and_Non-_Deterministic_Finite_Automata_to_Regular_Expression_using_Brzozowski_Algebraic_Method","abstract":"Regular expressions are widely used in the field of compiler design, text editor, search for an email-address, train track switches, pattern matching, context switching and in many other areas of computer science. Regular expressions are used to represent certain set of string in algebraic manner. The demand of converting regular expression into finite automata and vice versa motivates research into some alternative so that time taken for above is minimized. For conversion of deterministic and non-deterministic finite automata to regular expression, Brzozowski Algebraic method, also known as Arden's Theorem is used in this paper because of its simplicity and straight forwardness.","authors":["Akpa Alih","Alih Daniel"],"meta":["April 2020International Journal of Scientific and Engineering Research 11(4):53-60"],"references":["276491925_The_Equivalent_Conversion_between_Regular_Grammar_and_Finite_Automata","345506840_String_Generation_for_Testing_Regular_Expressions","307962645_Representation_of_Events_in_Nerve_Nets_and_Finite_Automata","305414069_Computation_of_regular_expression_derivatives","267139112_A_Dictionary_of_Computing","263025047_From_Finite_Automata_to_Regular_Expressions_and_Back--A_Summary_on_Descriptional_Complexity","249958848_Converting_Deterministic_Finite_Automata_to_Regular_Expressions","221498931_Delayed-logic_and_finite-state_machines","220459973_Generational_of_regular_expressions_for_automata_by_the_integral_of_regular_expressions","220430648_Derivatives_of_Regular_Expressions","3345670_Problem_Solving_in_Automata_Languages_and_Complexity"]}
