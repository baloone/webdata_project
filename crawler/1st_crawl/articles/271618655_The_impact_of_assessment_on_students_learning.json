{"id":"271618655_The_impact_of_assessment_on_students_learning","abstract":"In this paper, a methodology for characterizing assessment environments at an engineering program level that is able to distinguish between weak, average, and talented students has been presented. Also an Assessment Experience Questionnaire (AEQ) that is competent of measuring students' learning response has been presented. These two methods are used in this paper to study various undergraduate degree programs in Engineering. Finally, the correlation between characteristics of assessment environments and student learning responses and also features of assessment environments that appear to be associated with positive learning responses also provided.
