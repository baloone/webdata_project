{"id":"343654350_COVID-19_Prediction_Models_and_Unexploited_Data","abstract":"For COVID-19, predictive modeling, in the literature, uses broadly SEIR/SIR, agent-based, curve-fitting techniques/models. Besides, machine-learning models that are built on statistical tools/techniques are widely used. Predictions aim at making states and citizens aware of possible threats/consequences. However, for COVID-19 outbreak, state-of-the-art prediction models are failed to exploit crucial and unprecedented uncertainties/factors, such as a) hospital settings/capacity; b) test capacity/rate (on a daily basis); c) demographics; d) population density; e) vulnerable people; and f) income versus commodities (poverty). Depending on what factors are employed/considered in their models, predictions can be short-term and long-term. In this paper, we discuss how such continuous and unprecedented factors lead us to design complex models, rather than just relying on stochastic and/or discrete ones that are driven by randomly generated parameters. Further, it is a time to employ data-driven mathematically proved models that have the luxury to dynamically and automatically tune parameters over time.","authors":["Kc Santosh"],"meta":["August 2020Journal of Medical Systems 44(9):170","DOI:10.1007/s10916-020-01645-z"],"references":["342118292_Forecasting_Models_for_Coronavirus_Disease_COVID-19_A_Survey_of_the_State-of-the-Art","341648529_Epidemic_Model_Guided_Machine_Learning_for_COVID-19_Forecasts_in_the_United_States","341591800_Intelligent_Systems_and_Methods_to_Combat_Covid-19","340492967_Composite_Monte_Carlo_Decision_Making_under_High_Uncertainty_of_Novel_Coronavirus_Epidemic_Using_Hybridized_Deep_Learning_and_Fuzzy_Rule_Induction","340470465_Flattening_the_curve_before_it_flattens_us_hospital_critical_care_capacity_limits_and_mortality_from_novel_coronavirus_SARS-CoV2_cases_in_US_counties","340017266_AI-Driven_Tools_for_Coronavirus_Outbreak_Need_of_Active_Learning_and_Cross-Population_TrainTest_Models_on_MultitudinalMultimodal_Data","344052250_Time-Window_SIQR_Analysis_of_COVID-19_Outbreak_and_Containment_Measures_in_Italy","339034354_The_Role_of_Augmented_Intelligence_AI_in_Detecting_and_Preventing_the_Spread_of_Novel_Coronavirus"]}
