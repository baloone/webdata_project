{"id":"330379116_Mandelbrot_and_Julia_Sets_via_Jungck-CR_Iteration_with_s-Convexity","abstract":"Today fractals play an important role in many fields, e.g., image compression or encryption, biology, physics etc. One of the earliest studied fractal types was the Mandelbrot and Julia sets. These fractals have been generalized in many different ways. One of such generalizations is the use of various iteration processes from fixed point theory. In this paper, we study the use of Jungck-CR iteration process extended further by the use of s-convex combination. The Jungck-CR iteration process with s-convexity is implicit three step feedback iteration process.We prove new escape criteria for the generation of Mandelbrot and Julia sets via the proposed iteration process. Moreover, we present some graphical examples obtained by the use of escape time algorithm and the derived criteria.","authors":["Young Chel Kwun","Muhammad Tanveer","Waqas Nazeer","Krzysztof Gdawiec"],"meta":["January 2019IEEE Access PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2892013"],"references":["324229351_Fixed_point_results_for_the_complex_fractal_generation_in_the_S_-iteration_orbit_with_s_-convexity","319979740_Fractal_patterns_from_the_dynamics_of_combined_polynomial_root_finding_methods","314302967_Fractals_through_modified_iteration_scheme","309372136_Fixed_point_results_for_fractal_generation_in_Noor_orbit_and_s-convexity","293822198_Fixed_Point_Results_In_Tricorn_Multicorns_of_Ishikawa_Iteration_and_s-Convexity_FTMISC","282163334_Fixed_point_results_in_the_generation_of_Julia_and_Mandelbrot_sets","280939316_New_Fixed_Point_Results_for_Fractal_Generation_in_Jungck_Noor_Orbit_with_s_-Convexity","276263292_Tricorns_and_Multicorns_of_S_-Iteration_Scheme","315142624_Polynomiography_for_the_polynomial_infinity_norm_via_Kalantari's_formula_and_nonstandard_iterations","285897944_A_new_approach_to_superior_Julia_sets"]}
