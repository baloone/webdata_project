The constant is the smallest for which such a statement holds.","authors":["Ury Jamshy","Andr√© Raspaud","Michael Tarsi"],"meta":["December 1987Journal of Combinatorial Theory Series B 43(3):354-357","DOI:10.1016/0095-8956(87)90011-6","SourceDBLP"],"references":["265370658_A_Class_of_Abelian_Groups","264926766_Integral_Boundary_Points_of_Convex_Polyhedra","239064938_A_Contribution_to_the_Theory_of_Chromatic_Polynomials","222601671_Shortest_covering_of_graphs_with_cycles","222361007_Flows_and_generalized_Coloring_Theorems_in_graphs","220078065_Nowhere_zero_flow_and_circuit_covering_in_regular_matroids"]}
