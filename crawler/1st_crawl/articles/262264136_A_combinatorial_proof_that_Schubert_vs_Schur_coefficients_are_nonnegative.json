{"id":"262264136_A_combinatorial_proof_that_Schubert_vs_Schur_coefficients_are_nonnegative","abstract":"We give a combinatorial proof that the product of a Schubert polynomial by a\nSchur polynomial is a nonnegative sum of Schubert polynomials. Our proof uses\nAssaf's theory of dual equivalence to show that a quasisymmetric function of\nBergeron and Sottile is Schur-positive. By a geometric comparison theorem of\nBuch and Mihalcea, this implies the nonnegativity of Gromov-Witten invariants\nof the Grassmannian.","authors":["Sami Assaf","Nantel Bergeron","Frank Sottile"],"meta":["May 2014","SourcearXiv"],"references":["259604725_The_puzzle_conjecture_for_the_cohomology_of_two-step_flag_manifolds","2552876_Integrality_of_two_variable_Kostka_functions","2396582_Pieri's_Formula_For_Flag_Manifolds_And_Schubert_Polynomials","2219447_Skew_Schubert_Functions_And_The_Pieri_Formula_For_Flag_Manifolds","2219227_Schubert_polynomials_the_Bruhat_order_and_the_geometry_of_flag_manifolds","2181222_Affine_Hecke_algebras_and_raising_operators_for_Macdonald_polynomials","2114008_A_Pieri-type_formula_for_the_K-theory_of_a_flag_manifold","268650100_Symmetric_functions_and_Hall_polynomials_2nd_ed","265538124_Interpolation_Integrality_and_a_Generalization_of_Macdonald's_Polynomials","253020134_Group_Characters_and_Algebra","246900992_Multipartite_P-partitions_and_inner_products_of_skew_Schur_functions","243015311_On_Schensted's_Construction_and_the_Multiplication_of_Schur_Functions","228729424_A_Monoid_For_The_Grassmaniann_Bruhat_Order","226701138_Schubert_polynomials_and_the_Littlewood-Richardson_rule","222460688_Hopf_Algebras_and_Edge-Labeled_Posets","220185067_Dual_equivalence_with_applications_including_a_conjecture_of_Proctor","51956136_Positroid_Varieties_Juggling_and_Geometry","51914432_Dual_equivalence_and_Schur_positivity","45918879_Dual_equivalence_graphs_and_a_combinatorial_proof_of_LLT_and_Macdonald_positivity","31071614_The_Geometry_of_Flag_Manifolds","2551812_Quantum_Schubert_Calculus","2550790_Plethystic_Formulas_for_Macdonald_qt-Kostka_Coefficients","2353858_RC-Graphs_and_Schubert_Polynomials","2349459_On_a_Quantum_Version_of_Pieri's_Formula","2181092_Ribbon_Tableaux_Hall-Littlewood_Functions_Quantum_Affine_Algebras_And_Unipotent_Varieties","2107651_Gromov-Witten_invariants_on_Grassmannians","2097163_Hilbert_schemes_polygraphs_and_the_Macdonald_positivity_conjecture"]}
