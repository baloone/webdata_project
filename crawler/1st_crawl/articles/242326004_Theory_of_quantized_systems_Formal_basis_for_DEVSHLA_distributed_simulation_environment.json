{"id":"242326004_Theory_of_quantized_systems_Formal_basis_for_DEVSHLA_distributed_simulation_environment","abstract":"In the context of a DARPA ASTT project, we are developing an\nHLA-compliant distributed simulation environment based on the DEVS\nformalism. This environment will provide a user- friendly, high-level\ntool-set for developing interoperable discrete and continuous simulation\nmodels. One application is the study of contract-based predictive\nfiltering. This paper presents a new approach to predictive filtering\nbased on a process called 'quantization' to reduce state update\ntransmission. Quantization, which generates state updates only at\nquantum level crossings, abstracts a sender model into a DEVS\nrepresentation. This affords an alternative, efficient approach to\nembedding continuous models within distributed discrete event\nsimulations. Applications of quantization to message traffic reduction\nare discussed. The theory has been validated by DEVSJAVA simulations of\ntest cases. It will be subject to further test in actual distributed\nsimulations using the DEVS/HLA modeling and simulation environment.","authors":["Bernard Phillip Zeigler","J. S.
