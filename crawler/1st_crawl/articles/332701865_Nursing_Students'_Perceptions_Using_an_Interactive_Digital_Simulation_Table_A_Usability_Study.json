{"id":"332701865_Nursing_Students'_Perceptions_Using_an_Interactive_Digital_Simulation_Table_A_Usability_Study","abstract":"Background. There is a need to enhance simulation activities in nursing education to prepare students for clinical practice. The purpose of this study was to assess ease of use and usefulness in a newly developed interactive digital simulation table to promote technology uptake before the table was embedded in nursing curriculum.\nMethods. A usability study including survey and interviews was conducted to test the interactive digital simulation table with nursing students. The scenario used in this study provided students with practice in decision- making when caring for a client with asthma/chronic obstructive lung disease.\nResults. Participants found the interactive digital simulation table easy to use and felt it would be useful for nursing education as it provided an experience similar to real clinical practice.\nConclusion. There is evidence to support including the interactive digital simulation table as part of a suite of simulations offered to nursing students.","authors":["Margaret Anne Verkuyl","Lorraine Betts","Suba Sivaramalingam"],"meta":["April 2019Simulation & Gaming 50(6):104687811984428","DOI:10.1177/1046878119844283"],"references":["320324602_Virtual_Simulations_in_Nursing_Education_A_Scoping_Review","285367562_The_NCSBN_National_Simulation_Study_A_Longitudinal_Randomized_Controlled_Study_Replacing_Clinical_Hours_with_Simulation_in_Prelicensure_Nursing_Education","283879412_A_Systematic_Review_of_the_Experience_of_Using_Second_Life_in_the_Education_of_Undergraduate_Nurses","235356393_Using_thematic_analysis_in_psychology","51179069_Nursing_Students'_Attitudes_Toward_Video_Games_and_Related_New_Media_Technologies","8128206_Usability_of_health_web_sites_for_older_adults_A_preliminary_study","332100350_Virtual_Gaming_Simulation_in_Nursing_Education_A_Mixed-Methods_Study","321699942_Clinical_Virtual_Simulation_in_Nursing_Education","307531205_Virtual_gaming_to_develop_students'_pediatric_nursing_skills_A_usability_test","303390109_Online_Virtual_Simulation_and_Diagnostic_Reasoning_A_Scoping_Review","298795769_Impact_of_Virtual_Simulation_to_Teach_Concepts_of_Disaster_Triage","280289456_The_Student_Experience_Using_Virtual_Reality_Simulation_to_Teach_Decontamination","273506800_The_Use_of_Virtual_Simulation_and_a_Modified_TeamSTEPPS_Training_for_Multiprofessional_Education","270608304_Simulation_and_gaming_to_promote_health_education_Results_of_a_usability_test","237146538_Virtual_Worlds_in_Nursing_Education_A_Synthesis_of_the_Literature","230786766_Measuring_the_User_Experience_Collecting_Analyzing_and_Presenting_Usability_Metrics_Second_Edition","229514608_Extrinsic_and_Intrinsic_Motivation_to_Use_Computers_in_the_Workplace1","51513095_Establishing_a_Virtual_Learning_Environment_A_Nursing_Experience","51184496_Development_and_Evaluation_of_a_Three-Dimensional_Virtual_Hospital_Unit_VI-MED","31656164_Handbook_of_Usability_Testing_How_to_Plan_Design_and_Conduct_Effective_Tests"]}
