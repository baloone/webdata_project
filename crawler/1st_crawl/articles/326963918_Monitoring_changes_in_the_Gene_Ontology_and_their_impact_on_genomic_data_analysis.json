To document the effects of GO evolution on enrichment, we analyzed over 2500 published hit lists of human genes (most over 9 years old). 53% of hit lists were considered to yield significantly stable enrichment results.\n\nConclusions\nBecause stability is far from assured for any individual hit list, GOtrack can lead to more informed and cautious application of GO to genomics research.","authors":["Matthew Jacobson","Adriana Sedeno","Paul Pavlidis"],"meta":["August 2018GigaScience 7(8)","DOI:10.1093/gigascience/giy103"],"references":["323987333_Interpretation_of_biological_experiments_changes_with_evolution_of_the_Gene_Ontology_and_its_annotations","318613237_NoGOA_Predicting_noisy_GO_annotations_using_evidences_and_sparse_representation","312008003_Gene_Ontology_Pitfalls_Biases_and_Remedies","301847719_Gene_Ontology_Pitfalls_Biases_Remedies","311510720_Using_predictive_specificity_to_determine_when_gene_set_analysis_is_biologically_meaningful","307511449_Impact_of_outdated_gene_annotations_on_pathway_enrichment_analysis","304806762_Systematic_and_integrative_analysis_of_large_gene_lists_using_DAVID_bioinformatics_resources","281345608_Ggplot2_Elegant_Graphics_for_Data_Analysis","274015857_Team_RDCR_A_Language_And_Environment_For_Statistical_Computing_R_Foundation_for_Statistical_Computing_Vienna_Austria","268750669_Pitfalls_in_the_application_of_gene-set_analysis_to_genetics_studies","262787978_A_method_for_increasing_expressivity_of_Gene_Ontology_annotations_using_a_compositional_approach","260914901_Understanding_how_and_why_the_Gene_Ontology_and_its_annotations_evolve_The_GO_within_UniProt","258639181_Ten_Quick_Tips_for_Using_the_Gene_Ontology","244957482_A_knowledge-based_approach_for_interpreting_genome-wide_expression_prolules","237054842_A_task-based_approach_for_Gene_Ontology_evaluation"]}
