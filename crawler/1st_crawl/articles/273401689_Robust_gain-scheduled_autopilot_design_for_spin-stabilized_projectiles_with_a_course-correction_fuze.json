{"id":"273401689_Robust_gain-scheduled_autopilot_design_for_spin-stabilized_projectiles_with_a_course-correction_fuze","abstract":"This article explores the design of a pitch/yaw axis load factor autopilot for a class of 155-mm spin-stabilized ammunition which incorporates a novel nose-positioned course correction fuze system used for trajectory correction. The projectile full nonlinear model is discussed and a procedure for obtaining the system q-LPV model necessary for control synthesis is exposed. Important properties relevant to axis cross-coupling, internal modes and stability properties specific to this kind of system are also highlighted. A comparison of full- and reduced-order mixed-sensitivity linear compensators with an additional model following constraint for the design of the projectile autopilot is presented. Robust stability with respect to aerodynamic and actuator/sensor modeling uncertainties is verified via standard μ-analysis tools throughout the projectile flight envelope. Nonlinear 7-DoF trajectory simulation results are finally presented for a single or dual control surface actuator configuration.","authors":["Spilios Theodoulis","Florian Sève","Philippe Wernert"],"meta":["May 2015Aerospace Science and Technology 42","DOI:10.1016/j.ast.2014.12.027","Project: PhD thesis"],"references":["259229860_Nonsmooth_H_Synthesis","258985778_Survey_of_gain-scheduling_analysis_and_design","243777742_Gain-Scheduled_Missile_Autopilot_Design_using_Linear_Parameter_Varying_Transformation","229058308_Multivariable_Feedback_Control_Analysis_and_Design","274133221_Guidance_and_Control_of_a_Projectile_with_Reduced_Sensor_and_Actuator_Requirements","271036016_Thrusters_Pairing_Guidelines_for_Trajectory_Corrections_of_Projectiles","270085999_Guidance_and_Control_Design_for_a_Class_of_Spin-Stabilized_Fin-Controlled_Projectiles","270050118_Agile_Missile_Dynamics_and_Control","269063425_Adaptive_autopilot_design_for_guided_munitions","268554677_Course_Correction_Fuze_Concept_Analysis_for_In-Service_155_mm_Spin-Stabilized_Gunnery_Projectiles","266289066_Robust_control_and_H-optimization-Tutorial_paper","265353123_Survey_of_gain-scheduling_analysis_and_design","261718478_Ballistics_Theory_Design_of_Guns_and_Ammunition","261281417_Fixed_structure_robust_control_design_for_the_155mm_canard-guided_projectile_roll-channel_autopilot","251663964_Roll-pitch-yaw_integrated_m-synthesis_for_high_angle-of-attack_missiles","245433932_Design_of_a_Roll-Stabilized_Mortar_Projectile_with_Reciprocating_Canards","245431820_Bank-to-turn_missile_autopilot_design_using_loop_transfer_recovery","245372887_Model_Predictive_Control_of_a_Direct_Fire_Projectile_Equipped_With_Canards","245371619_Modeling_and_Simulation_of_Aerospace_Vehicle_Dynamics","245345916_Missle_autopilot_design_using_quasi-LPV_polynomial_eigenstructure_assignment","245274263_An_Adaptive_Autopilot_Design_for_Guided_Munitions","238667753_Control_Authority_of_a_Projectile_Equipped_with_a_Controllable_Internal_Translating_Mass","238176871_Agile_Missile_Dynamics_and_Control","236849984_Aircraft_System_Identification_Theory_And_Practice","235028066_Linear_Theory_of_a_Dual-Spin_Projectile_in_Atmospheric_Flight","233130453_An_application_of_H_design_to_model-following","224401764_Predictive_Guidance_of_a_Projectile_for_Hit-to-Kill_Interception","222697980_Prediction_of_swerving_motion_of_a_dual-spin_projectile_with_lateral_pulse_jets_in_atmospheric_flight","222582622_Missile_autopilot_design_via_a_modified_LPV_synthesis_technique","220159667_Research_on_Gain_Scheduling","27813103_Missile_autopilot_design_via_a_multi-channel_LFTLPV_control_method","3007190_Missile_autopilot_design_using_quasi-LPV_polynomial_eigenstructure_assignment"]}
