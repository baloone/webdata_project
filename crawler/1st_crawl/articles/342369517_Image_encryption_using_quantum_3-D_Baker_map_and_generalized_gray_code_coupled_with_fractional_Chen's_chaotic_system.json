To have this 3-D quantum representation, we harness the NEQR model for a \\(2^n \\times 2^n\\) grayscale image. In the second step of the proposed encryption scheme, we implement a substitution routine which starts by implementing the generalized gray code on the permuted image and concludes with selected intra bit-XOR-ing and XOR-ing with the pseudorandom sequence generated by the Fractional Chenâ€™s system. The encryption scheme utilizes the basic quantum gates like C-NOT, Toffoli, and Ripple-carry adder due to their computational efficiency. The theoretical and numerical simulation results show that the algorithm has the potential to be used as an image encryption algorithm on quantum computers.","authors":["Farhan Musanna","Sanjeev Kumar"],"meta":["August 2020Quantum Information Processing 19(8)","DOI:10.1007/s11128-020-02724-3"],"references":["328561865_Multi-image_encryption_scheme_based_on_quantum_3D_Arnold_transform_and_scaled_Zhongtang_chaotic_system","324782403_Bit-level_quantum_color_image_encryption_scheme_with_quantum_cross-exchange_operation_and_hyper-chaotic_system","323665525_A_Novel_Quantum_Image_Steganography_Scheme_Based_on_LSB","318602346_Quantum_Image_Encryption_Based_on_Iterative_Framework_of_Frequency-Spatial_Domain_Transforms","317174397_Quantum_image_encryption_scheme_with_iterative_generalized_Arnold_transforms_and_quantum_image_cycle_shift_operations","315525875_A_Simple_Encryption_Algorithm_for_Quantum_Color_Image","308014520_Quantum_Color_Image_Encryption_Algorithm_Based_on_A_Hyper-Chaotic_System_and_Quantum_Fourier_Transform","338301713_Nonlinear_optical_multi-image_encryption_scheme_with_two-dimensional_linear_canonical_transform","329952114_Quantum_Image_Encryption_Using_Intra_and_Inter_Bit_Permutation_Based_on_Logistic_Map","308940778_Red-Green-Blue_Multi-Channel_Quantum_Representation_of_Digital_Images","299499164_Quantum_image_encryption_based_on_generalized_affine_transform_and_logistic_map","297663183_Quantum_Image_Encryption_Algorithm_Based_on_Quantum_Image_XOR_Operations","286904546_A_survey_of_quantum_image_representations","276481465_Quantum_image_Gray-code_and_bit-plane_scrambling","276308744_Quantum_image_encryption_based_on_generalized_Arnold_transform_and_double_random-phase_encoding"]}
