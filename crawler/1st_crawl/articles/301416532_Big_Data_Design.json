{"id":"301416532_Big_Data_Design","abstract":"It is widely accepted today that Relational databases are not appropriate in highly distributed shared-nothing architectures of commodity hardware, that need to handle poorly structured heterogeneous data. This has brought the blooming of NoSQL systems with the purpose of mitigating such problem, specially in the presence of analytical workloads. Thus, the change in the data model and the new analytical needs beyond OLAP take us to rethink methods and models to design and manage these newborn repositories. In this paper, we will analyze state of the art and future research directions.","authors":["Alberto Abell√≥"],"meta":["October 2015","DOI:10.1145/2811222.2811235","Conference: the ACM Eighteenth International Workshop"],"references":["265910179_Tuning_Small_Analytics_on_Big_Data_Data_Partitioning_and_Secondary_Indexes_in_the_Hadoop_Ecosystem","259511049_Extending_ER_Models_to_Capture_Database_Transformations_to_Build_Data_Sets_for_Data_Mining","226763355_The_log-structured_merge-tree_LSM-tree","220425416_A_co-Relational_Model_of_Data_for_Large_Shared_Data_Banks","220415613_Scalable_SQL_and_NoSQL_data_stores","2395793_Consistent_Hashing_and_Random_Trees_Distributed_Caching_Protocols_for_Relieving_Hot_Spots_on_the_World_Wide_Web","312917980_The_Google_file_system","305261816_A_decomposition_storage_model","300335011_Towards_Next_Generation_BI_Systems_The_Analytical_Metadata_Challenge","274479822_Big_Data_and_Its_Technical_Challenges","262806780_An_empirical_study_of_sentence_features_for_subjectivity_and_polarity_classification","262305146_Data-intensive_applications_challenges_techniques_and_technologies_A_survey_on_Big_Data","243523763_The_ansisparc_dbms_model","242787226_Technical_perspective_One_size_fits_all_An_idea_whose_time_has_come_and_gone","221213599_A_Decomposition_Storage_Model","220910111_The_Google_File_System","220439168_Bigtable_A_Distributed_Storage_System_for_Structured_Data","220423134_A_Relational_Model_of_Data_for_Large_Shared_Data_Banks","200034304_A_Relational_Model_for_Large_Shared_Data_Banks"]}
