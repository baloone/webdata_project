{"id":"260194322_Separating_Regular_Languages_with_First-Order_Logic","abstract":"Given two languages, a separator is a third language that contains the first\none and is disjoint from the second one. We investigate the following decision\nproblem: given two regular input languages of finite words, decide whether\nthere exists a first-order definable separator. We prove that in order to\nanswer this question, sufficient information can be extracted from semigroups\nrecognizing the input languages, using a fixpoint computation. This yields an\nEXPTIME algorithm for checking first-order separability. Moreover, the\ncorrectness proof of this algorithm yields a stronger result, namely a\ndescription of a possible separator. Finally, we generalize this technique to\nanswer the same question for regular languages of infinite words.","authors":["Thomas Place","Marc Zeitoun"],"meta":["February 2014","DOI:10.1145/2603088.2603098","SourcearXiv"],"references":["235772028_Efficient_Separability_of_Regular_Languages_by_Subsequences_and_Suffixes","221350628_First-order_definable_languages","2510507_Some_Algorithmic_Problems_for_Pseudovarieties","1892744_Aperiodic_Pointlikes_and_Beyond","321518398_Elements_of_Finite_Model_Theory","281885951_Separating_Regular_Languages_by_Locally_Testable_and_Locally_Threshold_Testable_Languages","266433584_Finite_Automata_Formal_Logic_and_Circuit_Complexity","242982640_Pointlike_sets_the_finest_aperiodic_cover_of_a_finite_semigroup","242431981_Mathematical_Grounds_of_Automata_Theory","236326036_Separating_Regular_Languages_by_Piecewise_Testable_and_Unambiguous_Languages","222446091_On_finite_monoids_having_only_trivial_subgroups","222271126_Star-free_regular_sets_of_o-sequences","220994600_Classifying_Discrete_Temporal_Properties","220976507_Recent_Results_on_Automata_and_Infinite_Words","220898120_An_Eilenberg_Theorem_for_Infinity-Languages","220692648_Descriptive_Complexity","220247451_Application_of_Model_Theoretic_Games_to_Discrete_Linear_Orders_and_Finite_Automata","220155757_Finite-automaton_aperiodicity_is_PSPACE-complete","220154606_Languages_and_Scanners","35991539_Tense_logic_and_the_theory_of_linear_order","2819472_Languages_Automata_and_Logic"]}
