{"id":"226953499_Partial_t-spreads_and_group_constructible_-nets","abstract":"We give a method for constructing (s,r,)-nets out of partial t-spreads. As one consequence, we are able to apply a theorem of Bose and Bush to improve the known upper bound for the number of subspaces in a partial t-spread. Conversely, known existence results for partial t-spreads yield (s,r,)-nets with large replication number r.","authors":["David A. Drake","J. W.
