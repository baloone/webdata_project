{"id":"220755236_Classifying_human-robot_interaction_An_updated_taxonomy","abstract":"This paper extends taxonomy of human-robot interaction (HRI) introduced in 2002 to include additional categories as well as updates to the categories from the original taxonomy. New classifications include measures of the social nature of the task (human interaction roles and human-robot physical proximity), task type, and robot morphology.","authors":["Holly A.
