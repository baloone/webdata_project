{"id":"335747292_COMBINED_PATH_FOLLOWING_CONTROLLER_FOR_AUTONOMOUS_VEHICLES","abstract":"In the future, vehicles with a high level of automation are expected to become more popular. These systems are increasingly taking control of the vehicle, and supporting the driving task. Vehicles with a high level of automation have the task of planning the path and following it safely. In this paper, the authors want to improve the quality of path following by further developing an already existing combined controller, by optimizing controller parameters and taking the two controllers into account with different weights. A vehicle model is implemented for this purpose, which also includes the dynamics of steering. The combined controller includes both pure pursuit and Stanley controllers, the accuracy of operation was tested by simulation.","authors":["Ádám Domina","Viktor Tihanyi"],"meta":["May 2019"],"references":["328992230_Adaptive_Trajectory_Tracking_Controller_for_an_Armoured_Vehicle_Hardware-in-the-Ioop_Simulation","318696468_Hybrid_controller_approach_for_an_autonomous_ground_vehicle_path_tracking_problem","255036858_Automatic_Steering_Methods_for_Autonomous_Automobile_Path_Tracking"]}
