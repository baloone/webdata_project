{"id":"271218294_A_Review_of_Theory_and_Practice_in_Scientometrics","abstract":"Scientometrics is the study of the quantitative aspects of the process of\nscience as a communication system. It is centrally, but not only, concerned\nwith the analysis of citations in the academic literature. In recent years it\nhas come to play a major role in the measurement and evaluation of research\nperformance. In this review we consider: the historical development of\nscientometrics, sources of citation data, citation metrics and the \"laws\" of\nscientometrics, normalisation, journal impact factors and other journal\nmetrics, visualising and mapping science, evaluation and policy, and future\ndevelopments.","authors":["John Mingers","Loet Leydesdorff"],"meta":["April 2015European Journal of Operational Research http://authors.elsevier.com/sd/article/S037722171500274X","DOI:10.1016/j.ejor.2015.04.002","SourcearXiv"],"references":["313767443_Caveats_for_the_Use_of_Citation_Indicators_in_Research_and_Journal_Evaluations","305492362_Cited_References_and_Medical_Subject_Headings_MeSH_as_Two_Different_Knowledge_Representations_Clustering_and_Mappings_at_the_Paper_Level","289211064_Science_Overlay_Maps_A_New_Tool_for_Research_Policy_and_Library_Management","347173653_The_Theory_and_Practice_of_Science_IndicatorsToward_a_Metric_of_Science_The_Advent_of_Science_IndicatorsScience_Indicators_1976","313047599_Mapping_of_science_by_combined_co-citation_and_word_analysis_i_Structural_aspects","312652713_Eigenfactor_Does_the_principle_of_repeated_improvement_result_in_better_estimates_than_raw_citation_counts","312608175_Hyperauthorship_A_Postmodern_Perversion_or_Evidence_of_a_Structural_Shift_in_Scholarly_Communication_Practices","298852493_The_Matthew_Effect_in_Science","292766856_Testing_university_rankings_statistically_Why_this_is_not_such_a_good_idea_after_all_Some_reflections_on_statistical_power_effect_sizes_random_sampling_and_imaginary_populations","292587139_Publication_dynamics_and_citation_impact_A_multi-dimensional_approach_to_scientometric_research_evaluation"]}
