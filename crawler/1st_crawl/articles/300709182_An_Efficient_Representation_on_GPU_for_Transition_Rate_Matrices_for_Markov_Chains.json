{"id":"300709182_An_Efficient_Representation_on_GPU_for_Transition_Rate_Matrices_for_Markov_Chains","abstract":"The authors present a novel modification of the HYB format — known from the CUSP library. The new format is suitable for sparse Markovian transition rate matrices and enables processing two times bigger matrices on single GPU, also improving computation performance at the same time. Particularly, the SpMV operation — that is the multiplication of a sparse matrix by a vector — is analyzed for this format on one GPU and two GPUs. Numerical experiments for transition rate matrices of Markov chains from [18] show that the proposed format allows to process matrices of sizes about \\(3.6 \\times 10^7\\) rows with the use of single GPU (3 GB RAM). When the plain HYB format is used the matrices of these sizes do not fit in one GPUs memory. Moreover, the use of the modified HYB format can give the speedup even up to 13 times in comparison to multi-threaded CPU (12 cores).","authors":["Jarosław Bylina","Beata Bylina","Marek Karwacki"],"meta":["May 2014","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-55224-3_62","Conference: International Conference on Parallel Processing and Applied Mathematics"],"references":["269512447_Computational_Aspects_of_GPU-accelerated_Sparse_Matrix-Vector_Multiplication_for_Solving_Markov_Models","261481698_Multi-GPU_implementation_of_the_uniformization_method_for_solving_Markov_models","232806254_Improving_GPU_Sparse_Matrix-Vector_Multiplication_for_Probabilistic_Model_Checking","220431865_Efficient_Descriptor-Vector_Multiplications_in_Stochastic_Automata_Networks","51041816_Fast_parallel_Markov_clustering_in_bioinformatics_using_massively_parallel_computing_on_GPU_with_CUDA_and_ELLPACK-R_sparse_format","290326104_A_Markovian_Model_of_a_Network_of_Two_Wireless_Devices","289284204_A_CPU-GPU_Hybrid_Approach_to_the_Uniformization_Method_for_Solving_Markovian_Models_-_A_Case_Study_of_a_Wireless_Network","228680178_Efficient_Sparse_Matrix-Vector_Multiplication_on_CUDA","226949335_A_Markovian_queuing_model_of_a_WLAN_node","220691339_Introduction_to_the_Numerical_Solution_of_Markov_Chains","24300699_Numerical_Methods_in_Markov_Chain_Modeling","3234321_Performance_analysis_of_the_IEEE_80211_distributed_coordination_function"]}
