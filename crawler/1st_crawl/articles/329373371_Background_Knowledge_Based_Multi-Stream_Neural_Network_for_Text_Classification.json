{"id":"329373371_Background_Knowledge_Based_Multi-Stream_Neural_Network_for_Text_Classification","abstract":"As a foundation and typical task in natural language processing, text classification has been widely applied in many fields. However, as the basis of text classification, most existing corpus are imbalanced and often result in the classifier tending its performance to those categories with more texts. In this paper, we propose a background knowledge based multi-stream neural network to make up for the imbalance or insufficient information caused by the limitations of training corpus. The multi-stream network mainly consists of the basal stream, which retained original sequence information, and background knowledge based streams. Background knowledge is composed of keywords and co-occurred words which are extracted from external corpus. Background knowledge based streams are devoted to realizing supplemental information and reinforce basal stream. To better fuse the features extracted from different streams, early-fusion and two after-fusion strategies are employed. According to the results obtained from both Chinese corpus and English corpus, it is demonstrated that the proposed background knowledge based multi-stream neural network performs well in classification tasks.","authors":["Fuji Ren","Deng Jiawen"],"meta":["December 2018Applied Sciences 8(12):2472","DOI:10.3390/app8122472"],"references":["326217242_Imbalanced_text_sentiment_classification_using_universal_and_domain-specific_knowledge","325066930_Current_Market_Top_Business_Scopes_Trend-A_Concurrent_Text_and_Time_Series_Active_Learning_Study_of_NASDAQ_and_NYSE_Stocks_from_2012_to_2017","324955250_Building_an_effective_and_efficient_background_knowledge_resource_to_enhance_ontology_matching","324508348_DKN_Deep_Knowledge-Aware_Network_for_News_Recommendation","324486274_Self-Interaction_Attention_Mechanism-Based_Text_Representation_for_Document_Classification","323627297_Targeted_Aspect-Based_Sentiment_Analysisvia_Embedding_Commonsense_Knowledge_into_an_Attentive_LSTM","334115618_Transformation_Networks_for_Target-Oriented_Sentiment_Classification","327993051_Towards_efficient_and_objective_work_sampling_Recognizing_workers'_activities_in_site_surveillance_videos_with_two-stream_convolutional_networks","326075747_A_survey_on_text_document_categorization_using_enhanced_sentence_vector_space_model_and_bi-gram_text_representation_model_based_on_novel_fusion_techniques","324071524_Advanced_Sentiment_Classification_of_Tibetan_Microblogs_on_Smart_Campuses_Based_on_Multi-Feature_Fusion"]}
