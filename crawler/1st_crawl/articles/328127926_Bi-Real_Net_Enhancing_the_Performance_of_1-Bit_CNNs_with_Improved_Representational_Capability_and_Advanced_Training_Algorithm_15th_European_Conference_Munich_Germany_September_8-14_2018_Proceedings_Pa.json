While being efficient, the classification accuracy of the current 1-bit CNNs is much worse compared to their counterpart real-valued CNN models on the large-scale dataset, like ImageNet. To minimize the performance gap between the 1-bit and real-valued CNN models, we propose a novel model, dubbed Bi-Real net, which connects the real activations (after the 1-bit convolution and/or BatchNorm layer, before the sign function) to activations of the consecutive block, through an identity shortcut. Consequently, compared to the standard 1-bit CNN, the representational capability of the Bi-Real net is significantly enhanced and the additional cost on computation is negligible. Moreover, we develop a specific training algorithm including three technical novelties for 1-bit CNNs. Firstly, we derive a tight approximation to the derivative of the non-differentiable sign function with respect to activation. Secondly, we propose a magnitude-aware gradient with respect to the weight for updating the weight parameters. Thirdly, we pre-train the real-valued CNN model with a clip function, rather than the ReLU function, to better initialize the Bi-Real net. Experiments on ImageNet show that the Bi-Real net with the proposed training algorithm achieves 56.4% and 62.2% top-1 accuracy with 18 layers and 34 layers, respectively. Compared to the state-of-the-arts (e.g., XNOR Net), Bi-Real net achieves up to 10% higher top-1 accuracy with more memory saving and lower computational cost.","authors":["Zechun Liu","Baoyuan Wu","Wenhan Luo","Xin Yang"],"meta":["September 2018","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-01267-0_44","In book: Computer Vision â€“ ECCV 2018 (pp.747-763)"],"references":["321417623_Towards_Accurate_Binary_Convolutional_Neural_Network","317241042_End-to-end_Active_Object_Tracking_via_Reinforcement_Learning","313645102_Incremental_Network_Quantization_Towards_Lossless_CNNs_with_Low-Precision_Weights","311610617_Face_Alignment_Across_Large_Poses_A_3D_Solution","306187717_Factorized_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","305196650_Going_deeper_with_convolutions","301817286_lp-Box_ADMM_A_Versatile_Framework_for_Integer_Programming","301292064_Unsupervised_CNN_for_Single_View_Depth_Estimation_Geometry_to_the_Rescue","272845187_Learning_Depth_from_Single_Monocular_Images_Using_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Fields","271463117_Simultaneous_Clustering_and_Tracklet_Linking_for_Multi-face_Tracking_in_Videos","265295439_ImageNet_Large_Scale_Visual_Recognition_Challenge","331106682_End-to-End_Active_Object_Tracking_and_Its_Real-World_Deployment_via_Reinforcement_Learning","322060726_PPR-FCN_Weakly_Supervised_Visual_Relation_Detection_via_Parallel_Pairwise_R-FCN","320965273_Visual_Translation_Embedding_Network_for_Visual_Relation_Detection","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","319769911_Faster_R-CNN_Towards_Real-Time_Object_Detection_with_Region_Proposal_Networks","318981940_PPR-FCN_Weakly_Supervised_Visual_Relation_Detection_via_Parallel_Pairwise_R-FCN","314092522_Visual_Translation_Embedding_Network_for_Visual_Relation_Detection","311609041_Deep_Residual_Learning_for_Image_Recognition","309475476_A_Coupled_Hidden_Markov_Random_Field_Model_for_Simultaneous_Face_Clustering_and_Tracking_in_Videos","308277201_Identity_Mappings_in_Deep_Residual_Networks","308277088_XNOR-Net_ImageNet_Classification_Using_Binary_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","306218037_Learning_multiple_layers_of_features_from_tiny_images","286512696_Deep_Residual_Learning_for_Image_Recognition","283471201_BinaryConnect_Training_Deep_Neural_Networks_with_binary_weights_during_propagations","272194743_Batch_Normalization_Accelerating_Deep_Network_Training_by_Reducing_Internal_Covariate_Shift","266031774_Reading_Digits_in_Natural_Images_with_Unsupervised_Feature_Learning","262324509_Extensive_Facial_Landmark_Localization_with_Coarse-to-Fine_Convolutional_Network_Cascade","261259065_Deep_Convolutional_Network_Cascade_for_Facial_Point_Detection","258374356_Rich_Feature_Hierarchies_for_Accurate_Object_Detection_and_Semantic_Segmentation"]}
