{"id":"337035115_Multivariable_Repetitive_Control_Decentralized_Designs_With_Application_to_Continuous_Media_Flow_Printing","abstract":"The print productivity and medium dimensions of wide-format roll-to-roll printing systems are limited by position errors induced by step-wise medium transportation. The aim of the paper is to develop a design framework for multivariable repetitive control (RC), that enables improved productivity and accuracy through continuous media flow printing. The developed technical framework for RC explicitly addresses the trade-off between performance and modeling requirements through decentralized designs. In particular, systematic design approaches are developed that explicitly address unmodeled interaction as uncertainty, i.e., through robustness. The result is a range of solutions, including i) independent single-input single-output (SISO) designs, and ii) sequential SISO design. Experimental results confirm that the developed RC framework in conjunction with continuous media flow printing outperforms existing approaches.","authors":["Lennart Blanken","Sjirk Koekebakker","Tom Oomen"],"meta":["November 2019IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TMECH.2019.2951609"],"references":["324647301_Frequency_Domain_Design_of_Iterative_Learning_Control_and_Repetitive_Control_for_Complex_Motion_Systems","322593955_Multivariable_Repetitive_Control_Design_Framework_Applied_to_Flatbed_Printing_with_Continuous_Media_Flow","309878498_Design_Techniques_for_Multivariable_ILC_Application_to_an_Industrial_Flatbed_Printer","299578029_A_Simplified_Method_For_Discrete-Time_Repetitive_Control_Using_Model-Less_FIR_Filter_Inversion","280832287_Repetitive_control_of_MIMO_systems_using_H_design","243770195_Analysis_and_Synthesis_of_Discrete-Time_Repetitive_Controllers","226944308_The_Moisture_and_Rate-Dependent_Mechanical_Properties_of_Paper_A_Review","223996193_The_Internal_Model_Principle_of_Control_Theory","3020073_Repetitive_control_system_A_new_type_servo_system_for_periodic_exogenous_signals","350448881_System_Identification_A_Frequency_Domain_Approach","332665738_Multivariable_Iterative_Learning_Control_Design_Procedures_From_Decentralized_to_Centralized_Illustrated_on_an_Industrial_Printer","322615797_Non-parametric_identification_of_multivariable_systems_A_local_rational_modeling_approach_with_application_to_a_vibration_isolation_benchmark","305626232_Design_of_decentralized_multi-input_multi-output_repetitive_control_systems","291019222_Bi-Orthonormal_Polynomial_Basis_Function_Framework_With_Applications_in_System_Identification","285641797_From_the_early_achievement_to_the_revival_of_experiment_design","266534573_Mathematics_of_dynamical_systems","264863773_Using_iterative_learning_control_with_basis_functions_to_compensate_medium_deformation_in_a_wide-format_inkjet_printer","257388145_On_the_Theory_and_Design_of_Linear_Repetitive_Control_Systemsg","256123913_Sequential_design_of_decentralized_controllers","254807321_Advanced_Motion_Control_Design","254223876_Synthesis_of_robust_multivariable_Iterative_Learning_Controllers_with_application_to_a_wafer_stage_motion_system","254059169_Two-Period_Repetitive_and_Adaptive_Control_for_Repeatable_and_Nonrepeatable_Runout_Compensation_in_Disk_Drive_Track_Following","245489094_Sequential_Design_of_Linear_Multivariable_Systems","245373103_Robust_Performance_Repetitive_Control_Systems","245320897_Robust_multivariable_feedback_design","241416020_Multipass_printing_in_an_ink-jet_device","230873160_Multivariate_Feedback_Design","228341379_System_Identification_of_Complex_and_Structured_Systems","225075788_Robust_and_Optimal_Control","222570473_Design_of_noise_and_period-time_robust_high-order_repetitive_control_with_application_to_optical_storage","222553780_Repetitive_control_for_system_with_uncertain_period-time","222279852_Interaction_Measures_for_Systems_Under_Decentralized_Control","222046723_Robust_high-order_repetitive_control_Optimal_performance_trade-offs","44346630_Computer-Controlled_Systems_Theory_and_Design","3028713_On_the_generalized_Nyquist_stability_criterion","3020184_Some_New_Properties_of_the_Structured_Singular_Value"]}
