The paper discusses the improvement of ANFIS when used with Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm optimization (PSO), Ant Colony Optimization for continuous domains (ACOR), and Differential evolution (DE). For this purpose, three input of multiple variables are selected in order to predict monthly minimum, average and maximum air temperatures for 34 meteorological stations in Iran. Determination coefficient (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and Nash‐Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) are used as evaluation criteria. Comparison of suggested fuzzy models indicates that the ANFIS with GA shows the best performance in prediction of the maximum temperatures. It decreases the RMSE of classic ANFIS model in the validation stage from 1.22 to 1.12°C for Mashhad, 1.26‐1.01°C for Zahedan, 1.20‐0.98°C for Ahvaz, 1.76‐1.24°C for Rasht, and 1.21‐0.95°C for Tabriz.
