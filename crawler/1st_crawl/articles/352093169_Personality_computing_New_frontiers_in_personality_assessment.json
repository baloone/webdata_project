{"id":"352093169_Personality_computing_New_frontiers_in_personality_assessment","abstract":"Personality Computing (PC) is a burgeoning field at the intersection of personality and computer science that seeks to extract personality-relevant information (e.g., on Big Five trait levels) from sensor-assessed information (e.g., written texts, digital footprints, smartphone usage, non-verbal behavior, speech patterns, game-play, etc.). Such sensor-based personality assessment promises novel and often technologically sophisticated ways to unobtrusively measure individual differences in a highly precise, granular, and faking-resistant manner. We review the different conceptual underpinnings of PC; survey how well different types of sensors can capture different types of personality-relevant information; discuss the evaluation of PC performance and psychometric issues (reliability and validity) of sensor-derived scores as well as ethical, legal, and societal implications; and highlight how modern personality and computer science can be married more effectively to provide practically useful personality assessment. Together, this review aims to introduce readers to the opportunities, challenges, pitfalls, and implications of PC.","authors":["Le Vy Phan","John F.
