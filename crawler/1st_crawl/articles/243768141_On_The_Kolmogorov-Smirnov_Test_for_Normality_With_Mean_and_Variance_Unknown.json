{"id":"243768141_On_The_Kolmogorov-Smirnov_Test_for_Normality_With_Mean_and_Variance_Unknown","abstract":"The standard tables used for the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test are valid when testing whether a set of observations are from a completely-specified continuous distribution. If one or more parameters must be estimated from the sample then the tables are no longer valid.A table is given in this note for use with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic for testing whether a set of observations is from a normal population when the mean and variance are not specified but must be estimated from the sample. The table is obtained from a Monte Carlo calculation.A brief Monte Carlo investigation is made of the power of the test.","authors":["Hubert W.
