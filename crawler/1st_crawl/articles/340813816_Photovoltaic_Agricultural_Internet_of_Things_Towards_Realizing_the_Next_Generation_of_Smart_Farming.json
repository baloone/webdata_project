{"id":"340813816_Photovoltaic_Agricultural_Internet_of_Things_Towards_Realizing_the_Next_Generation_of_Smart_Farming","abstract":"Serious challenges for to drive agricultural sustainability combined with climate crisis issues have induced an urgent need to decarbonise agriculture. In this paper, we briefly introduce a novel concept of the Photovoltaic Agricultural Internet of Things (PAIoT). This system approach fuses agricultural production with renewable power generation and control via an IoT platform.We discuss PAIoT applications and potential to realize the next generation of smart farming. In addition, we provide a review of key issues on the feasibility of PAIoT and further propose novel techniques to mitigate these key issues.","authors":["Kai Huang","Lei Shu","Kailiang Li","Fan Yang"],"meta":["April 2020IEEE Access PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2988663"],"references":["335578129_Precision_Agriculture_Techniques_and_Practices_From_Considerations_to_Applications","334858202_Internet-of-Things_IoT-Based_Smart_Agriculture_Toward_Making_the_Fields_Talk","334854689_Enabling_Communication_Networks_for_Water_Quality_Monitoring_Applications_A_Survey","334266770_A_Photovoltaic_Greenhouse_with_Variable_Shading_for_the_Optimization_of_Agricultural_and_Energy_Production","332800566_Extreme_Weather_Events_in_Agriculture_A_Systematic_Review","332490923_State-of-the-Art_Internet_of_Things_in_Protected_Agriculture","338144711_Agriculture_IoT_Emerging_Trends_Cooperation_Networks_and_Outlook","338038980_Spatiotemporal_Characteristics_of_Urban-Rural_Construction_Land_Transition_and_Rural-Urban_Migrants_in_Rapid-Urbanization_Areas_of_Central_China","332256319_Standalone_direct_pumping_photovoltaic_system_or_energy_storage_in_batteries_for_supplying_irrigation_networks_Cost_analysis","331823391_A_Life_Cycle_Framework_of_Green_IoT-Based_Agriculture_and_Its_Finance_Operation_and_Management_Issues"]}
