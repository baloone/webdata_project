{"id":"276923155_An_Efficient_Automatic_Approach_to_High_Performance_Heterogeneous_Computing","abstract":"Users of heterogeneous computing systems face two problems: firstly,\nunderstanding the trade-off relationship between the observable characteristics\nof their applications, such as latency and quality of the result, and secondly,\nhow to exploit knowledge of these characteristics to allocate work to\ndistributed resources efficiently. A domain specific approach addresses both of\nthese problems. By considering a subset of operations, models of the observable\ncharacteristics or domain metrics may be formulated in advance, and populated\nat runtime for particular problem instances. These metric models can then be\nused to express the allocation of work as a formal integer linear programming\nproblem, which can be solved using heuristics, numerical method-based\noptimisers or constrained optimisation frameworks.\nThese claims are illustrated using the example domain of derivatives pricing\nin computational finance, with the domain metrics of workload latency or\nmakespan and pricing accuracy. For a large, varied workload of 128\nBlack-Scholes and Heston model-based option pricing tasks, running upon a\ndiverse array of 16 Multicore CPUs, GPUs and FPGAs platforms, predictions made\nby models of both the makespan and accuracy are generally within 10% of the\nperformance actually seen at runtime. When these models are used as inputs to\nnumerical optimiser and formal optimisation-based workload partitioning\napproaches, a latency improvement of up to 24 and 270 times over a naive\nheuristic approach is seen.","authors":["Gordon Inggs","David B.
