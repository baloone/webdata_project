{"id":"261718080_Exact_algorithms_for_problems_related_to_the_densest_k-set_problem","abstract":"Many graph concepts such as cliques, k -clubs, and k -plexes are used to define cohesive subgroups in a social network. The concept of densest k-set is one of them. A densest k-set in an undirected graph G=(V,E)G=(V,E) is a vertex set S⊆VS⊆V of size k such that the number of edges in the subgraph of G induced by S is maximum among all subgraphs of G induced by vertex sets of size k . One can obtain a densest k -set of G in O(k2nk)O(k2nk) time by exhaustive-search technique for an undirected graph of n vertices and a number k<nk<n. However, if the value of k approaches n/2n/2, the running time of the exhaustive-search algorithm is O⁎(2n)O⁎(2n). Whether there exists an O⁎(cn)O⁎(cn)-time algorithm with the fixed constant c<2c<2 to find a densest k -set in an undirected graph of n vertices remains open in the literature. In this paper, we point out that the densest k -set problem and and a class of problems related to the concept of densest k -sets can be solved in time O⁎(1.7315n)O⁎(1.7315n).","authors":["Maw-Shang Chang","Li-Hsuan Chen","Ling-Ju Hung","Peter Rossmanith"],"meta":["September 2014Information Processing Letters 114(9)","DOI:10.1016/j.ipl.2014.04.009"],"references":["239553716_Algorithms_and_Resource_Requirements_for_Fundamental_Problems","225547640_The_densest_k-subgraph_problem_on_clique_graphs","220753049_Improved_Upper_Bounds_for_Partial_Vertex_Cover","220616489_A_Fast_Parametric_Maximum_Flow_Algorithm_and_Applications","220544010_Parameterized_Complexity_of_Vertex_Cover_Variants","265702193_The_complexity_of_clustering_in_planar_graphs","265219134_Exact_and_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Densest_k-Subgraph","225163027_Random_Separation_A_New_Method_for_Solving_Fixed-Cardinality_Optimization_Problems","223679213_A_new_algorithm_for_optimal_2-constraint_satisfaction_and_its_implications","222978023_Faster_algorithms_for_computing_power_indices_in_weighted_voting_games","222509268_Clustering_and_domination_in_perfect_graphs","222307097_Fixed-Parameter_Tractability_and_Completeness_II_On_Completeness_for_W1","221369179_Exact_Algorithms_for_NP-Hard_Problems_A_Survey","221296882_Finding_Dense_Subgraphs_with_Size_Bounds","220898213_On_Finding_Dense_Subgraphs","220112762_Sort_and_Search_Exact_algorithms_for_generalized_domination","30987754_Parameterized_Complexity_of_Cardinality_Constrained_Optimization_Problems"]}
