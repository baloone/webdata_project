{"id":"300787574_Horizontal_Fragmentation_and_Replication_for_Multiple_Relaxation_Attributes","abstract":"The data replication problem (DRP) describes the task of distributing copies of data records (that is, database fragments) among a set of servers in a distributed database system. For the application of flexible query answering, several fragments can be overlapping (in terms of tuples in a database table). In this paper, we provide a formulation of the DRP for horizontal fragmentations with overlapping fragments; subsequently we devise a recovery procedure based on these fragmentations.","authors":["Lena Wiese"],"meta":["July 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-20424-6_16","Conference: British International Conference on Databases"],"references":["291102539_HYRISE","286277572_Clustering-based_fragmentation_and_data_replication_for_flexible_query_answering_in_distributed_databases","220895964_Towards_Profitable_Virtual_Machine_Placement_in_the_Data_Center","261195503_Energy-Efficient_Virtual_Machine_Replication_and_Placement_in_a_Cloud_Computing_System","222642400_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Time_Constrained_Scheduling","222445329_A_Theory_and_Methodology_of_Inductive_Learning","222300785_Static_and_adaptive_distributed_data_replication_using_genetic_algorithms","221465781_Generalizing_Conjunctive_Queries_for_Informative_Answers","221214412_Integrating_Vertical_and_Horizontal_Partitioning_Into_Automated_Physical_Database_Design","200031992_Principles_of_Distributed_Database_Systems"]}
