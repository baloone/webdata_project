{"id":"318916258_Ultra-broadband_graphene-InSb_heterojunction_photodetector","abstract":"We demonstrate a room temperature ultra-broadband graphene-InSb heterostructure photodetector. By introducing a thin oxide layer between the P-type graphene film and N-type InSb, the dark current is suppressed sharply. The device can detect light from the visible to far infrared region, exhibiting a high responsivity of ∼70 mA W⁻¹ at a typical wavelength of 1.7 μm. It is worth mentioning that the photodetector has delivered a mid-infrared (MIR) photoresponsivity of ∼42 mA W⁻¹, which also opens a way for MIR communication technology.","authors":["Jianbao Xu","Junxiong Hu","Rubing Wang","Qi Li"],"meta":["July 2017Applied Physics Letters 111(5):051106","DOI:10.1063/1.4997327"],"references":["314648384_High-Speed_Scalable_Silicon-MoS2_P-N_Heterojunction_Photodetectors","271140048_Broadband_Photodetector_Based_on_Graphene-Bi2Te3_Heterostructure","260205902_Chip-integrated_ultrafast_graphene_photodetector_with_high_responsivity","309737312_INDIUM_ANTIMONIDE_InSb_In_2_Volumes","290028511_Broadband_Photovoltaic_Detectors_Based_on_an_Atomically_Thin_Heterostructure","286373136_High_Detectivity_Graphene-Silicon_Heterojunction_Photodetector","272200977_Infrared_Detection_Using_Transparent_and_Flexible_Field-Effect_Transistor_Array_with_Solution_Processable_Nanocomposite_Channel_of_Reduced_Graphene_Oxide_and_PVDF-TrFE","260842151_Graphene_photodetectors_with_ultra-broadband_and_high_responsivity_at_room_temperature","260647000_Ultra-Broadband_Photodetector_for_the_Visible_to_Terahertz_Range_by_Self-Assembling_Reduced_Graphene_Oxide-Silicon_Nanowire_Array_Heterojunctions","257778997_Fabrication_of_large_area_hexagonal_boron_nitride_thin_films_for_bendable_capacitors","236653320_Broadband_High_Photoresponse_from_Pure_Monolayer_Graphene_Photodetector","235634030_CMOS-compatible_graphene_photodetector_covering_all_optical_communication_bands","256855680_Optical_spectroscopy_of_graphene_From_the_far_infrared_to_the_ultraviolet","234168703_Graphene_plasmonics","230835138_Channel_length_scaling_of_MoS"]}
