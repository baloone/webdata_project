{"id":"263041125_Warm_but_Maybe_Not_So_Competent_-Contemporary_Implicit_Stereotypes_of_Women_and_Men_in_Germany","abstract":"A fundamental model of stereotypes, the stereotype content model (SCM, Fiske, Cuddy, Glick, & Xu, 2002), postulates that stereotypes of many social groups vary on two core dimensions: warmth and competence. In line with traditional gender stereotypes, the SCM predicts women to be perceived as warmer than men, and men to be perceived as more competent than women. Research on implicit measurement of stereotypes suggests that, next to people’s underlying beliefs, a major predictor is the tendency to favor one’s own group (Rudman, Greenwald, & McGhee, 2001). We examined gender stereotypes concerning warmth and competence, using Implicit Association Tests (IATs, Greenwald, McGhee, & Schwartz, 1998) and drawing on diverse samples of women and men in eastern and western Germany (i.e., students and non-students; total N = 384). On the warmth dimension, women and men showed a traditional women-warmth stereotype, confirming predictions of the SCM. On the competence dimension, associations of own gender and competence were observed for both men and women, suggesting the impact of self-favoring processes. Findings are discussed with respect to social role theory (Eagly, 1987) and the changing roles of women.","authors":["Sex Roles","Irena Ebert","Melanie C.
