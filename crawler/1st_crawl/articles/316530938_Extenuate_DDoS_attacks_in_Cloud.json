{"id":"316530938_Extenuate_DDoS_attacks_in_Cloud","abstract":"The leading of Computing Paradigm is Cloud. One Sword two edges. One side is growing in terms of technology and user can use any where any time, and the other edge is security probing to data loss, data theft, data hijacking and acting as someone else. The user or data should be given protection to enjoy the benefits of the cloud. There are various kinds of attacks taking place in Cloud which are undetected for years. One kind of attack is DDos and its variants are causing damage in cloud. In our paper we addressed DDoS attacks using Ensemble Cluster Plus technique which helps in identifying genuinely of the user.","authors":["Bejjam Kiranmai","A.
