{"id":"265466879_Towards_a_Requirements_Specification_Multi-View_Framework_for_Self-Adaptive_Systems","abstract":"The research on requirements specification for self-adaptive systems has a growing interest in the academy and the industry. As a result, currently there exists different proposals for the specification of requirements for self-adaptive systems. Despite the momentum that this area has received in recent years, in the works reported in the literature we have identified shortcomings. We propose a new framework to represent the requirements of self-adaptive systems. This framework seeks to manage uncertainty and to be sufficiently expressive for self-adaptive systems, including the representation of all the relevant concepts. The concepts, represented in different views to be used in a 5-stage process. Specifically, we present: (i) a discussion of the challenges and problems encountered in the literature; (ii); our proposal to solve these challenges; and (iii) a case study of the problem and its application.","authors":["Juan C Muñoz-Fernández","Gabriel Tamura","Raúl Mazo","Camille Salinesi"],"meta":["September 2014","DOI:10.13140/2.1.3132.8640","Conference: CLEI 2014At: Montevideo, UruguayVolume: 1"],"references":["291941898_Engineering_self-adaptive_systems_through_feedback_loops","259231285_Using_Constraint_Programming_to_Manage_Configurations_in_Self-Adaptive_Systems","249901480_Goal-Oriented_Requirements_Engineering_An_Overview_of_the_Current_Research","225198353_Tropos_An_Agent-Oriented_Software_Development_Methodology","292975460_Self-adaptation_with_End-User_Preferences_Using_Run-Time_Models_and_Constraint_Solving","265780327_Non-Functional_Requirements_in_Software_Engineering","259231542_Dynamic_adaptation_of_service_compositions_with_variability_modelsG","239593893_A_Framework_for_Software_Product_Line_Practice","239577699_Agent-Oriented_Software_Engineering_III_Third_International_Workshop_AOSE_2002_Bologna_Italy_July_15_2002_Revised_Papers_and_Invited_Contributions","224264684_The_physics_of_notations_a_scientific_approach_to_designing_visual_notations_in_software_engineering","221556171_On_interacting_control_loops_in_self-adaptive_systems","221553964_Requirements_reflection_Requirements_as_runtime_entities","221553551_Awareness_Requirements_for_Adaptive_Systems","224192969_Towards_a_continuous_requirements_engineering_framework_for_self-adaptive_systems","222419941_Supporting_user-oriented_analysis_for_multi-view_domain-specific_visual_languages"]}
