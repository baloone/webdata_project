The most representative problem formulation is the Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) solved via Principal Component Pursuit (PCP) which decomposes a data matrix in a low-rank matrix and a sparse matrix. However, similar robust implicit or explicit decompositions can be made in the following problem formulations: Robust Non-negative Matrix Factorization (RNMF), Robust Matrix Completion (RMC), Robust Subspace Recovery (RSR), Robust Subspace Tracking (RST) and Robust Low-Rank Minimization (RLRM). The main goal of these similar problem formulations is to obtain explicitly or implicitly a decomposition into low-rank matrix plus additive matrices. In this context, this work aims to initiate a rigorous and comprehensive review of the similar problem formulations in robust subspace learning and tracking based on decomposition into low-rank plus additive matrices for testing and ranking existing algorithms for background/foreground separation. For this, we first provide a preliminary review of the recent developments in the different problem formulations which allows us to define a unified view that we called Decomposition into Low-rank plus Additive Matrices (DLAM). Then, we examine carefully each method in each robust subspace learning/tracking frameworks with their decomposition, their loss functions, their optimization problem and their solvers. Furthermore, we investigate if incremental algorithms and real-time implementations can be achieved for background/foreground separation. Finally, experimental results on a large-scale dataset called Background Models Challenge (BMC 2012) show the comparative performance of 32 different robust subspace learning/tracking methods.","authors":["Thierry Bouwmans","Andrews Sobral","Sajid Javed","Soon Ki Jung"],"meta":["November 2016Computer Science Review 23","DOI:10.1016/j.cosrev.2016.11.001"],"references":["321443362_A_Nonconvex_Relaxation_Approach_for_Rank_Minimization_Problems","319760799_Comparison_of_Matrix_Completion_Algorithms_for_Background_Initialization_in_Videos","314094289_Double-constrained_RPCA_based_on_saliency_maps_for_foreground_detection_in_automated_maritime_surveillance","314001577_Colorization_by_Patch-Based_Local_Low-Rank_Matrix_Completion","336511503_Low-rank_Matrix_Factorization_under_General_Mixture_Noise_Distributions","319325843_Foreground_Segmentation_with_Tree-Structured_Sparse_RPCA","316466625_Background_Subtraction_Using_Spatio-Temporal_Group_Sparsity_Recovery","315625729_Modified_RPCA_with_Hessian_Matrix_for_Object_Detection_in_Video_Surveillance_on_Highways","315055918_Reinforced_Robust_Principal_Component_Pursuit","314920027_R-SpaRCS_An_algorithm_for_foreground-background_separation_of_compressively-sensed_surveillance_videos","313513059_Jitter_Invariant_Incremental_Principal_Component_Pursuit_for_Video_Background_Modeling_on_the_TK1","313513220_Ghosting_Suppression_for_Incremental_Principal_Component_Pursuit_Algorithms","313472039_A_Fast_Factorization-Based_Approach_to_Robust_PCA","313175556_Robust_principal_component_analysis_based_on_low-rank_and_block-sparse_matrix_decomposition","313140268_Background_Modeling_in_Compressed_Sensing_Scheme"]}
