{"id":"301773581_An_effective_Fovea_detection_and_Automatic_assessment_of_Diabetic_Maculopathy_in_color_fundus_images","abstract":"Prolonged diabetes causes severe damage to the vision through leakage of blood and blood constituents over the retina. The effect of the leakage becomes more threatening when these abnormalities involve the macula. This condition is known as diabetic maculopathy and it leads to blindness, if not treated in time. Early detection and proper diagnosis can help in preventing this irreversible damage. To achieve this, the possible way is to perform retinal screening at regular intervals. But the ratio of ophthalmologists to patients is very small and the process of evaluation is time consuming. Here, the automatic methods for analyzing retinal/fundus images prove handy and help the ophthalmologists to screen at a faster rate. Motivated from this aspect, an automated method for detection and analysis of diabetic maculopathy is proposed in this work. The method is implemented in two stages. The first stage involves preprocessing required for preparing the image for further analysis. During this stage the input image is enhanced and the optic disc is masked to avoid false detection during bright lesion identification. The second stage is maculopathy detection and its analysis. Here, the retinal lesions including microaneurysms, hemorrhages and exudates are identified by processing the green and hue plane color images. The macula and the fovea locations are determined using intensity property of processed red plane image. Different circular regions are thereafter marked in the neighborhood of the macula. The presence of lesions in these regions is identified to confirm positive maculopathy. Later, the information is used for evaluating its severity. The principal advantage of the proposed algorithm is, utilization of the relation of blood vessels with optic disc and macula, which enhances the detection process. Proper usage of various color plane information sequentially enables the algorithm to perform better. The method is tested on various publicly available databases consisting of both normal and maculopathy images. The algorithm detects fovea with an accuracy of 98.92% when applied on 1374 images. The average specificity and sensitivity of the proposed method for maculopathy detection are obtained as 98.05% and 98.86% respectively.","authors":["Jyoti Prakash Medhi","Samarendra Dandapat"],"meta":["April 2016Computers in Biology and Medicine 74","DOI:10.1016/j.compbiomed.2016.04.007"],"references":["307786650_Detection_of_hemorrhages_in_diabetic_retinopathy_analysis_using_color_fundus_images","283099176_Automatic_and_efficient_detection_of_the_fovea_center_in_retinal_images","261020950_Improving_automatic_exudate_detection_based_on_the_fusion_of_the_results_of_multiple_active_contours","235388287_Automatic_exudate_detection_using_active_contour_model_and_regionwise_classification","234157717_Automated_Detection_and_Grading_of_Diabetic_Maculopathy_in_Digital_Retinal_Images","232630688_Automated_feature_extraction_for_early_detection_of_diabetic_retinopathy_in_fundus_images","224209197_An_automated_system_for_colored_retinal_image_background_and_noise_segmentation","46280956_Fovea_center_detection_based_on_the_retina_anatomy_and_mathematical_morphology","40442070_A_coarse-to-fine_strategy_for_automatically_detecting_exudates_in_color_eye_fundus_images","38097092_Automatic_Detection_of_Microaneurysms_and_Hemorrhages_in_Digital_Fundus_Images","8883391_Automated_Feature_Extraction_in_Color_Retinal_Images_by_a_Model_Based_Approach","7021129_Robust_Detection_and_Classification_of_Longitudinal_Changes_in_Color_Retinal_Fundus_Images_for_Monitoring_Diabetic_Retinopathy","6280898_A_novel_automatic_image_processing_algorithm_for_detection_of_hard_exudates_based_on_retinal_image_analysis","303265955_Detection_of_fovea_region_in_fundus_retinal_image_using_wavelet_transform_and_fuzzy_c-means_clustering","271456734_A_computer_aided_system_for_grading_of_maculopathy","261497791_Automatic_grading_of_macular_degeneration_from_color_fundus_images","261428034_Retinal_image_analysis_for_diagnosis_of_macular_edema_using_digital_fundus_images","261276705_A_novel_approach_for_diagnosis_and_severity_grading_of_diabetic_maculopathy","232203667_A_Threshold_Selection_Method_From_Gray-Level_Histograms","224359283_Appearance-based_object_detection_in_colour_retinal_images","221757634_Automated_detection_of_red_lesions_from_digital_colour_fundus_photographs","216274054_Automatic_grading_of_diabetic_maculopathy_severity_levels","51876675_Automatic_Assessment_of_Macular_Edema_From_Color_Retinal_Images","51593467_Exudate-based_diabetic_macular_edema_detection_in_fundus_images_using_publicly_available_datasets","45629937_General_Pathophysiology","23394238_Automatic_detection_of_diabetic_retinopathy_exudates_from_non-dilated_retinal_images_using_mathematical_morphology_methods","11489041_Automated_detection_of_diabetic_retinopathy_on_digital_fundus_images","10900778_A_contribution_of_image_processing_to_the_diagnosis_of_diabetic_retinopathy_-_Detection_of_exudates_in_color_fundus_images_of_the_human_retina","7510655_Anatomy_and_development_of_the_macula_Specialisation_and_the_vulnerability_to_macular_degeneration","6558793_Segmentation_of_the_Optic_Disc_Macula_and_Vascular_Arch_in_Fundus_Photographs","5449629_Automatic_segmentation_of_age-related_macular_degeneration_in_retinal_fundus_images"]}
