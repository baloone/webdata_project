{"id":"266586337_A_Cache_Timing_Attack_on_AES_in_Virtualization_Environments","abstract":"We show in this paper that the isolation characteristic of system virtualization can be bypassed by the use of a cache timing at-tack. Using Bernstein's correlation in this attack, an adversary is able to extract sensitive keying material from an isolated trusted execution domain. We demonstrate this cache timing attack on an embedded ARM-based platform running an L4 microkernel as virtualization layer. We also show that an attacker who gained access to the untrusted domain can extract the key of an AES-based authentication protocol used for a finan-cial transaction. We provide measurements for different public domain AES implementations. Our results indicate that cache timing attacks are highly relevant in trusted execution environments.","authors":["Michael Wei√ü","Benedikt Heinz","Frederic Stumpf"],"meta":["February 2012","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-32946-3_23","Conference: International Conference on Financial Cryptography and Data Security"],"references":["225948782_Trace-Driven_Cache_Attacks_on_AES_Short_Paper","225670330_Cache_Based_Remote_Timing_Attack_on_the_AES","224248629_Cache_Games_--_Bringing_Access-Based_Cache_Attacks_on_AES_to_Practice","221326841_Cache-Timing_Template_Attacks","220336960_Trace-Driven_Cache_Attacks_on_AES","308671289_Implementation_of_S-Box_for_Advanced_Encryption_Standard","249908229_Cache_time-behavior_analysis_on_AES","228939782_Cache-timing_attacks_on_AES","228874485_Cache_Attacks_and_Countermeasures_The_Case_of_AES","228377724_Cache_missing_for_fun_and_profit","221609031_A_refined_look_at_Bernstein's_AES_side-channel_analysis","221291586_Cache-Collision_Timing_Attacks_Against_AES","221208326_Differential_Cache-Collision_Timing_Attacks_on_AES_with_Applications_to_Embedded_CPUs","221208215_Cache_Attacks_and_Countermeasures_The_Case_of_AES","220269486_Hey_You_Get_Off_of_My_Cloud_Exploring_Information_Leakage_in_Third-Party_Compute_Clouds","3216456_Where_Does_Security_Stand_New_Vulnerabilities_vs_Trusted_Computing"]}
