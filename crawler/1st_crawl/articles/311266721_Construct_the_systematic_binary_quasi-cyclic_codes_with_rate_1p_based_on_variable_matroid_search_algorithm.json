{"id":"311266721_Construct_the_systematic_binary_quasi-cyclic_codes_with_rate_1p_based_on_variable_matroid_search_algorithm","abstract":"Because the matroid search algorithm is very complicated and the local matroid search algorithm can not search all optimal codes, this paper proposes a variable matroid search algorithm to search the quasi-cyclic codes by researching matroid search algorithm. The algorithm reduces the computational complexity by reducing the repeated search. Based on this algorithm, the systematic binary quasi-cyclic codes of which the rate is 1/p are constructed. With the change of integer p, the optimal codes of rate 1/p can be obtained by the generator matrix reducing or adding a loop matrix. Through experiments, two new codes of which the minimum distance is larger than the existing optimal codes are worked out, which indicate the feasibility and superiority of the algorithm.","authors":["S.
