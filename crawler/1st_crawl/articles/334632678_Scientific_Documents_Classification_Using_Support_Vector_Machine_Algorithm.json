{"id":"334632678_Scientific_Documents_Classification_Using_Support_Vector_Machine_Algorithm","abstract":"One of the ways to publish scientific paper is to present it in a conference. Before being presented in the conference, the registered scientific paper has to be grouped into categories. Because there are so many scientific papers that have been registered, it is an urgent need to establish a system that can automatically identify the topic of scientific papers and classify them according to recognized topics. One method that can be used to organize documents according to their categories is classification. In this study, Support Vector Machine algorithm is used as a method to classify documents into 5 categories of computer science. System test is done by taking 150 documents as data sample and 50 documents as data testing. This study produced a classification system of scientific documents and showed the method used was able to classify documents with 90% accuracy results.","authors":["Ivan Jaya","Indra Aulia","Sri melvani Hardi","Jos Timanta Tarigan"],"meta":["June 2019Journal of Physics Conference Series 1235(1):012082","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/1235/1/012082"],"references":["330187644_Improving_Data_Collection_on_Article_Clustering_by_Using_Distributed_Focused_Crawler","322408929_Clustering_articles_in_bahasa_Indonesia_using_self-organizing_map","317297561_Focused_crawler_for_the_acquisition_of_health_articles","283483410_Hierarchical_approach_for_scientific_document_classification","280113623_The_Text_Mining_Handbook_Advanced_Approaches_in_Analyzing_Unstructured_Data","220792993_Neural_Networks_for_Scientific_Paper_Classification","5608645_A_Comparison_of_Methods_for_Multiclass_Support_Vector_Machines"]}
