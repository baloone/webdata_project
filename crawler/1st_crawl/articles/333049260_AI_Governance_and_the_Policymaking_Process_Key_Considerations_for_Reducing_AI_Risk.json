{"id":"333049260_AI_Governance_and_the_Policymaking_Process_Key_Considerations_for_Reducing_AI_Risk","abstract":"This essay argues that a new subfield of AI governance should be explored that examines the policy-making process and its implications for AI governance. A growing number of researchers have begun working on the question of how to mitigate the catastrophic risks of transformative artificial intelligence, including what policies states should adopt. However, this essay identifies a preceding, meta-level problem of how the space of possible policies is affected by the politics and administrative mechanisms of how those policies are created and implemented. This creates a new set of key considerations for the field of AI governance and should influence the action of future policymakers. This essay examines some of the theories of the policymaking process, how they compare to current work in AI governance, and their implications for the field at large and ends by identifying areas of future research.","authors":["Brandon Perry","Risto Uuk"],"meta":["May 2019Big Data and Cognitive Computing 3(2):26","DOI:10.3390/bdcc3020026"],"references":["334378492_The_Role_and_Limits_of_Principles_in_AI_Ethics_Towards_a_Focus_on_Tensions","327179717_Superintelligence_Skepticism_as_a_Political_Tool","323302750_The_Malicious_Use_of_Artificial_Intelligence_Forecasting_Prevention_and_Mitigation","344109676_Long-Term_Strategies_for_Ending_Existential_Risk_from_Fast_Takeoff","330525002_Artificial_Intelligence_American_Attitudes_and_Trends","330297435_Regulating_Artificial_Intelligence_Proposal_for_a_Global_Solution","326725184_Viewpoint_When_Will_AI_Exceed_Human_Performance_Evidence_from_AI_Experts","326206286_AGI_Safety_Literature_Review","321381830_A_Survey_of_Artificial_General_Intelligence_Projects_for_Ethics_Risk_and_Policy","320182421_Superintelligence_paths_dangers_strategies"]}
