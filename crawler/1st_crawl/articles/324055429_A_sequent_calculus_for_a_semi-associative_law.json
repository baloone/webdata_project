{"id":"324055429_A_sequent_calculus_for_a_semi-associative_law","abstract":"We introduce a sequent calculus with a simple restriction of Lambek's product rules that precisely captures the classical Tamari order, i.e., the partial order on fully-bracketed words (equivalently, binary trees) induced by a semi-associative law (equivalently, right rotation). We establish a focusing property for this sequent calculus (a strengthening of cut-elimination), which yields the following coherence theorem: every valid entailment in the Tamari order has exactly one focused derivation. We then describe two main applications of the coherence theorem, including: 1. A new proof of the lattice property for the Tamari order, and 2. A new proof of the Tutte-Chapoton formula for the number of intervals in the Tamari lattice $Y_n$.","authors":["Noam Zeilberger"],"meta":["March 2018"],"references":["310769577_Planar_triangulations_bridgeless_planar_maps_and_Tamari_intervals","280445715_The_On-Line_Encyclopedia_of_Integer_Sequences","323707969_The_Mathematics_of_Sentence_Structure","319210122_Skew_monoidal_categories_and_skew_multicategories","312216452_A_sequent_calculus_for_the_Tamari_order","308960044_Permutohedra_and_Associahedra","303491640_Rotation_distance_triangulations_and_hyperbolic_geometry","291044709_Axiomatic_rewriting_theory_VI_Residual_theory_revisited","287853632_Linear_lambda_terms_as_invariants_of_rooted_trivalent_maps","275748872_Investigations_into_Logical_Deduction"]}
