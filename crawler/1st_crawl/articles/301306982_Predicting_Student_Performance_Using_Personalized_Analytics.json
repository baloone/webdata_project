{"id":"301306982_Predicting_Student_Performance_Using_Personalized_Analytics","abstract":"To help solve the ongoing problem of student retention, new expected performance-prediction techniques are needed to facilitate degree planning and determine who might be at risk of failing or dropping a class. Personalized multiregression and matrix factorization approaches based on recommender systems, initially developed for e-commerce applications, accurately forecast students' grades in future courses as well as on in-class assessments.","authors":["Asmaa Elbadrawy","Agoritsa Polyzou","Zhiyun Ren","Mackenzie Sweeney"],"meta":["April 2016Computer 49(4):61-69","DOI:10.1109/MC.2016.119"],"references":["271908944_Personalized_Multi-Regression_Models_for_Predicting_Students'_Performance_in_Course_Activities","254462829_Course_correction_Using_analytics_to_predict_course_success","237091880_Adapting_Bayesian_Knowledge_Tracing_to_a_Massive_Open_Online_Course_in_edX","221570491_Factorization_Models_for_Forecasting_Student_Performance","317953668_The_condition_of_education_2013_NCES_2013-037","308857640_Next-term_student_grade_prediction","301257892_Grade_Prediction_with_Course_and_Student_Specific_Models","295075075_Transfer_Learning_for_Predictive_Models_in_Massive_Open_Online_Courses","222675404_Data_mining_in_course_management_systems_Moodle_case_study_and_tutorial"]}
