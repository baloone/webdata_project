FAME 2 enrolled patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD), while the other two focused on non-culprit lesions in stabilized patients after acute coronary syndrome. A total of 2400 subjects were recruited from 54 sites world-wide with 1056 randomly assigned to FFR-guided PCI and 1344 to medical therapy. The pre-specified primary outcome was a composite of cardiac death or MI. We included data from extended follow-ups for FAME 2 (up to 5.5 years follow-up) and DANAMI-3-PRIMULTI (up to 4.7 years follow-up). After a median follow-up of 35 months (interquartile range 12-60 months), a reduction in the composite of cardiac death or MI was observed with FFR-guided PCI as compared with medical therapy (hazard ratio 0.72, 95% confidence interval 0.54-0.96; P = 0.02). The difference between groups was driven by MI.\n\nConclusion: \nIn this IPD meta-analysis of the three available randomized controlled trials to date, FFR-guided PCI resulted in a reduction of the composite of cardiac death or MI compared with medical therapy, which was driven by a decreased risk of MI.","authors":["Frederik Zimmermann","Elmir Omerovic","Stephane Fournier","Henning Kelb√¶k"],"meta":["December 2018European Heart Journal 40(2)","DOI:10.1093/eurheartj/ehy812"],"references":["327227707_2018_ESCEACTS_Guidelines_on_myocardial_revascularization","328791051_'Ten_commandments'_for_the_2018_ESCEACTS_Guidelines_on_Myocardial_Revascularization","325300265_Five-Year_Outcomes_with_PCI_Guided_by_Fractional_Flow_Reserve","325085848_ISCHEMIA_Establishing_the_Primary_End_Point","324422574_Letter_by_Hochman_and_Maron_regarding_article_'Faith_Healing'_and_'Subtraction_Anxiety'_in_unblinded_trials_of_procedures_Lessons_from_DEFER_and_FAME-2_for_end_points_in_the_ISCHEMIA_Trial","324070905_Influence_of_Local_Myocardial_Damage_on_Index_of_Microcirculatory_Resistance_and_Fractional_Flow_Reserve_in_Target_and_Nontarget_Vascular_Territories_in_a_Porcine_Microvascular_Injury_Model","323732386_Moving_the_Goalposts_Into_Unblinded_Territory_The_Larger_Lessons_of_DEFER_and_FAME_2_and_Their_Implications_for_Shifting_End_Points_in_ISCHEMIA","322465842_PCI_Strategies_in_Patients_with_Acute_Myocardial_Infarction_and_Cardiogenic_Shock","320819372_Percutaneous_coronary_intervention_in_stable_angina_ORBITA_A_double-blind_randomised_controlled_trial","318893942_Instantaneous_Wave-Free_Ratio_and_Fractional_Flow_Reserve_for_the_Assessment_of_Non-Culprit_Lesions_during_the_Index_Procedure_in_Patients_with_ST-Segment_Elevation_Myocardial_Infarction_The_WAVE_stud"]}
