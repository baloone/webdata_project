{"id":"256379082_On_the_convergence_of_Wilson's_nonconforming_element_for_solving_the_elastic_problems","abstract":"A nonconforming finite element, Wilson's element, for solving the elastic problem is mathematically studied. This element passes the patch-test. The errors on the stresses and displacements are shown to be asymptotically of order h and h2, respectively, where h is the supremum of the lengths of the sides of the elements.","authors":["Pierre Lesaint"],"meta":["January 1976Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering 7(1):1â€“16","DOI:10.1016/0045-7825(76)90002-5"],"references":["285090538_Experience_with_the_patch_test_for_convergence_of_finite_elements_The_mathematical_foundations_of_the_finite_element_method_with_applications_to_partial_differential_equations","279273183_Incompatible_Displacement_Models","269024283_Behavior_of_the_error_of_the_approximate_solutions_of_boundary_value_problems_for_linear_elliptic_operators_by_Galerkin's_and_finite_difference_methods","269004377_Experience_with_the_Patch_Test_for_Convergence_of_Finite_Elements_Method","265457298_Variational_crimes_in_the_finite_element_method","248042397_The_TUBA_family_of_elements_for_the_matrix_displacement_method","244502962_Some_nonconforming_finite_elements_for_the_plate_bending_problem","241021161_Conforming_and_nonconforming_finite_element_methods_for_solving_the_plate_problem","238717619_The_Finite_Element_Mehod_in_Engineering_Science","227137698_Raviart_PA_General_lagrange_and_hermite_interpolation_inR_with_applications_to_finite_element_methods_Arch_Rational_Mech_Anal46_177-199","226724201_Bounds_for_the_Class_of_Linear_Functionals_with_Application_to_Hermite_Interpolation","225866230_Ein_Kriterium_fur_die_Quasi-Optimalitat_des_Ritzschen_Verfahrens"]}
