{"id":"337573856_JolasMATIKA_An_Experience_for_Teaching_and_Learning_Computing_Topics_From_University_to_Primary_Education","abstract":"Contribution: A learning-by-teaching methodology through games can be used to promote informatics (computer science) in primary and secondary education. Applying the proposed activities can change students' perception of informatics from seeing it as merely using computers to seeing its relationship with mathematics. The experience can also help students acquire competences in teaching.","authors":["Edurne Larraza-Mendiluze","Olatz Arbelaitz","Ana Arruarte","J.F.
