{"id":"327764000_Analysing_Predicting_Students_Performance_in_an_Introductory_Computer_Science_Course","abstract":"Students of computer science studies enter university education with very different competencies, experience and knowledge. 145 datasets collected of freshmen computer science students by learning management systems in relation to exam outcomes and learning dispositions data (e. g. student dispositions, previous experiences and attitudes measured through self-reported surveys) has been exploited to identify indicators as predictors of academic success and hence make effective interventions to deal with an extremely heterogeneous group of students.","authors":["Alexander Tillmann","Detlef Kroemker","Florian Horn","Thorsten Gattinger"],"meta":["August 2018"],"references":["307144398_Implementing_a_Learning_Analytics_Intervention_and_Evaluation_Framework_What_Works","319476033_Stability_and_change_in_personality_and_personality_disorders","318992487_Student_profiling_in_a_dispositional_learning_analytics_application_using_formative_assessment","312144722_The_stability_of_personality_traits_in_adolescence_and_young_adulthood","305886333_How_do_the_big_five_influence_scholastic_performance_A_big_five-narrow_traits_model_or_a_double_mediation_model","285760478_The_big-five_trait_taxonomy_history_measurement_and_theoretical_perspectives","276835924_Participation-based_student_final_performance_prediction_model_through_interpretable_Genetic_Programming_Integrating_learning_analytics_educational_data_mining_and_theory","273258565_Learning_analytics_for_educational_decision_making","272030275_Adjustment_to_College_as_Measured_by_the_Student_Adaptation_to_College_Questionnaire_A_Quantitative_Review_of_its_Structure_and_Relationships_with_Correlates_and_Consequences","271729841_Development_and_Validation_of_Scores_on_a_Computer_Programming_Self-Efficacy_Scale_and_Group_Analyses_of_Novice_Programmer_Self-Efficacy"]}
