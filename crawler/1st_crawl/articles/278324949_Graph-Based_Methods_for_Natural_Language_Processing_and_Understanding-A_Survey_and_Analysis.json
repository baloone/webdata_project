{"id":"278324949_Graph-Based_Methods_for_Natural_Language_Processing_and_Understanding-A_Survey_and_Analysis","abstract":"This survey and analysis presents the functional components, performance, and maturity of graph-based methods for natural language processing and natural language understanding and their potential for mature products. Resulting capabilities from the methods surveyed include summarization, text entailment, redundancy reduction, similarity measure, word sense induction and disambiguation, semantic relatedness, labeling (e.g., word sense), and novelty detection. Estimated scores for accuracy, coverage, scalability, and performance are derived from each method. This survey and analysis, with tables and bar graphs, offers a unique abstraction of functional components and levels of maturity from this collection of graph-based methodologies.","authors":["Michael T.
