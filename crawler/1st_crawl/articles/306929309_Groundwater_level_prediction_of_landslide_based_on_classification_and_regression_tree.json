{"id":"306929309_Groundwater_level_prediction_of_landslide_based_on_classification_and_regression_tree","abstract":"According to groundwater level monitoring data of Shuping landslide in the Three Gorges Reservoir area, based on the response relationship between influential factors such as rainfall and reservoir level and the change of groundwater level, the influential factors of groundwater level were selected. Then the classification and regression tree (CART) model was constructed by the subset and used to predict the groundwater level. Through the verification, the predictive results of the test sample were consistent with the actually measured values, and the mean absolute error and relative error is 0.28 m and 1.15% respectively. To compare the support vector machine (SVM) model constructed using the same set of factors, the mean absolute error and relative error of predicted results is 1.53 m and 6.11% respectively. It is indicated that CART model has not only better fitting and generalization ability, but also strong advantages in the analysis of landslide groundwater dynamic characteristics and the screening of important variables. It is an effective method for prediction of ground water level in landslides.","authors":["Yannan Zhao","Yuan Li","Lifen Zhang","Qiuliang Wang"],"meta":["August 2016Geodesy and Geodynamics 7(5)","DOI:10.1016/j.geog.2016.07.005"],"references":["225195066_An_Empirical_Comparison_of_Pruning_Methods_for_Decision_Tree_Induction","298494486_Prediction_of_groundwater_level_in_landslides_based_on_radial_basis_function","296586171_Analysis_on_hydrodynamic_field_influenced_by_combination_of_rainfall_and_reservoir_level_fluctuation","293007684_Prediction_of_landslide_displacement_based_on_KPCA_and_PSO-SVR","290348076_Parameter_selection_for_support_vectormachines_based_on_genetic_algorithms_to_short-term_power_load_forecasting","288801340_Prediction_of_ground_water_level_in_landslides_based_on_genetic-support_vector_machine","283472627_Prediction_of_landslide_deformation_based_on_rough_sets_and_particle_swarm_optimization-support_vector_machine","248877331_Predicting_Ground-Water_Response_to_Precipitation","248323818_Tribological_properties_and_lubricating_mechanisms_of_the_rare_earth_complex_as_a_grease_additive","226998566_Significance_of_the_expression_of_green_fluorescent_protein_on_detection_of_glioma_invasion_in_vivo"]}
