{"id":"300217992_Give_Me_Another_One","abstract":"We investigate the complexity of an optimization problem in Boolean propositional logic related to information theory: Given a conjunctive formula over a set of relations, find a satisfying assignment with minimal Hamming distance to a given assignment that satisfies the formula (\\(\\mathsf {NearestOtherSolution}\\), \\(\\mathsf {NOSol}\\)).\nWe present a complete classification with respect to the relations admitted in the formula. We give polynomial-time algorithms for several classes of constraint languages. For all other cases we prove hardness or completeness regarding \\(\\mathrm {poly{\\text {-}}APX}\\), \\(\\mathrm {NPO}\\), or equivalence to a well-known hard optimization problem.","authors":["Mike Behrisch","Miki Hermann","Stefan Mengel","Gernot Salzer"],"meta":["December 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-3-662-48971-0_56","Conference: International Symposium on Algorithms and Computation"],"references":["272845725_Minimal_Distance_of_Propositional_Models","257749315_Weak_Bases_of_Boolean_Co-Clones","237654012_Playing_with_Boolean_Blocks_Part_II_Constraint_Satisfaction_Problems1","3084600_Hardness_of_Approximating_the_Minimum_Distance_of_a_Linear_Code","2279742_Closure_Properties_of_Constraints","268614150_Complexity_Classifications_of_Boolean_Constraint_Satisfaction_Problems","266515478_Complexity_and_approximation_Combinatorial_optimization_problems_and_their_approximability_properties_Incl_1_CD-ROM","257650319_Complexity_and_Approximation","227227296_Polynomial_interpolation_and_the_Chinese_Remainder_Theorem_for_algebraic_systems","223830765_Structure_Identification_of_Boolean_Relations_and_Plain_Bases_for_co-Clones","222813521_Bases_for_Boolean_co-clones","221590732_The_Complexity_of_Satisfiability_Problems","221150594_Dichotomy_Theorem_for_the_Generalized_Unique_Satisfiability_Problem","221025984_Partial_Polymorphisms_and_Constraint_Satisfaction_Problems","220555866_SIGACT_news_complexity_theory_column_43","2320646_The_Approximability_of_Constraint_Satisfaction_Problems"]}
