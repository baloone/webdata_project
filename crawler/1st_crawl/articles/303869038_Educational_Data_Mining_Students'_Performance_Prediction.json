{"id":"303869038_Educational_Data_Mining_Students'_Performance_Prediction","abstract":"It is important to study and analyse educational data especially students’ performance. Educational Data Mining (EDM) is the field of study concerned with mining educational data to find out interesting patterns and knowledge in educational organizations. This study is equally concerned with this subject, specifically, the students’ performance. This study explores multiple factors theoretically assumed to affect students’ performance in higher education, and finds a qualitative model which best classifies and predicts the students’ performance based on related personal and social factors.","authors":["Amjad Abu Saa"],"meta":["May 2016International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications 7(5)","DOI:10.14569/IJACSA.2016.070531"],"references":["221710771_Data_Mining_A_Prediction_for_Performance_Improvement_of_EngineeringStudents_using_Classification","221665812_Data_Mining_Applications_A_comparative_Study_for_Predicting_Student'sperformance","51989866_Data_Mining_A_prediction_for_performance_improvement_usingclassification","51989865_Mining_Educational_Data_to_Analyze_Students'_Performance","51888589_Data_Mining_A_prediction_of_performer_or_underperformer_usingclassification"]}
