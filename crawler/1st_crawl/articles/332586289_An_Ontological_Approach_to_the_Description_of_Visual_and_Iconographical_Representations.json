{"id":"332586289_An_Ontological_Approach_to_the_Description_of_Visual_and_Iconographical_Representations","abstract":"The perception of our heritage is based on sign-functions, which relate visual representations to cognitive types, allowing us to make perceptual judgements over physical objects. The recording of these types of assertions is paramount for the comprehension and analysis of our heritage. The article investigates a theoretical framework for the organization of information related to visual works on the basis of the identity and symbolic value of their single constituent elements. The framework developed is then used as a driver for the grounding of a new ontology called VIR (Visual Representation), constructed as an extension of CIDOC-CRM (CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model). VIR sustains the recording of statements about the different structural units and relationships of a visual representation, differentiating between object and interpretative act. The result, tested with data describing Byzantine and Renaissance artworks, presents solutions for describing symbols and meanings of iconographical objects, providing new clustering methods in relation to their constitutive elements, subjects or interpretations.","authors":["Nicola Carboni","Livio De Luca"],"meta":["April 2019Heritage 2(2):1191-1210","DOI:10.3390/heritage2020078"],"references":["301896062_Enhancing_Semantic_Expressivity_in_the_Cultural_Heritage_Domain_Exposing_the_Zeri_Photo_Archive_as_Linked_Open_Data","347945025_Mundane_Objects_Materiality_and_Non-verbal_Communication","346545430_The_Warrior_Saints_in_Byzantine_Art_and_Tradition","326340402_FaBIO_and_CiTO_Ontologies_for_Describing_Bibliographic_Resources_and_Citations","324895473_La_Madonna_della_Misericordia_individuale","313439381_Rhetorique_de_l'image","304826895_Che_cos'e_la_semiotica_visiva","303172872_Introduzione","288208073_Type_Theory_and_Semantics_in_Flux","287654180_Prolegomena_to_a_Theory_of_Language"]}
