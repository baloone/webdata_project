{"id":"323715778_Task_Offloading_for_Mobile_Edge_Computing_in_Software_Defined_Ultra-Dense_Network","abstract":"With the development of recent innovative applications (e.g., augment reality, self-driving and various cognitive applications), more and more computationintensive and data-intensive tasks are delay-sensitive. Mobile edge computing in ultra-dense network is expected as an effective solution for meeting the low latency demand. However, the distributed computing resource in edge cloud and energy dynamics in the battery of mobile device make it challenging to offload tasks for users. In this paper, leveraging the idea of software defined network, we investigate the task offloading problem in ultra-dense network aiming to minimize the delay while saving the battery life of userâ€™s equipment. Specifically, we formulate the task offloading problem as a mixed integer nonlinear program which is NP-hard. In order to solve it, we transform this optimization problem into two subproblems, i.e., task placement sub-problem and resource allocation sub-problem. Based on the solution of the two sub-problems, we propose an efficient offloading scheme. Simulation results prove that the proposed scheme can reduce 20% of the task duration with 30% energy saving, compared to random and uniform task offloading schemes.","authors":["Min Chen","Yixue Hao"],"meta":["March 2018IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/JSAC.2018.2815360"],"references":["320836425_An_empirical_study_of_latency_in_an_emerging_class_of_edge_computing_applications_for_wearable_cognitive_assistance","319622766_EMM_Energy-Aware_Mobility_Management_for_Mobile_Edge_Computing_in_Ultra_Dense_Networks","319299183_A_Survey_on_Mobile_Edge_Computing_The_Communication_Perspective","316643124_Joint_Task_Offloading_and_Resource_Allocation_for_Multi-Server_Mobile-Edge_Computing_Networks","316461781_TempoRec_Temporal-Topic_Based_Recommender_for_Social_Network_Services","304530746_Mobility-Aware_Caching_and_Computation_Offloading_in_5G_Ultra-Dense_Cellular_Networks","284766798_Adaptive_Multi-Resource_Allocation_for_Cloudlet-Based_Mobile_Cloud_Computing_System","283884904_Health-CPS_Healthcare_Cyber-Physical_System_Assisted_by_Cloud_and_Big_Data","282639722_Efficient_Multi-User_Computation_Offloading_for_Mobile-Edge_Cloud_Computing","276382972_Cloud-based_Wireless_Network_Virtualized_Reconfigurable_Smart_Wireless_Network_to_Enable_5G_Technologies","269298454_Can_mobile_cloudlets_support_mobile_applications","265849995_A_Stochastic_Workload_Distribution_Approach_for_an_Ad-Hoc_Mobile_Cloud","262805723_Software-Defined_Networking_A_Comprehensive_Survey","261462968_To_Offload_or_Not_to_Offload_The_Bandwidth_and_Energy_Costs_of_Mobile_Cloud_Computing","260670629_Network_Virtualization_and_Software_Defined_Networking_for_Cloud_Computing_A_Survey","325701389_Performance_benchmark_of_transcoding_as_a_virtual_network_function_in_CDN_as_a_service_slicing","322515230_Efficient_Transcoding_and_Streaming_Mechanism_in_Multiple_Cloud_Domains","322515026_Ensuring_End-to-End_QoS_Based_on_Multi-Paths_Routing_Using_SDN_Technology","320392890_Green_and_Mobility-Aware_Caching_in_5G_Networks","320250032_QoE_and_power_efficiency_tradeoff_for_fog_computing_networks_with_fog_node_cooperation","318995258_SOVCAN_Safety-Oriented_Vehicular_Controller_Area_Network","318806713_Content_delivery_network_slicing_QoE_and_cost_awareness","317611901_Self-Organized_Relay_Selection_for_Cooperative_Transmission_in_Vehicular_Ad-Hoc_Networks","317071973_On_Multi-Access_Edge_Computing_A_Survey_of_the_Emerging_5G_Network_Edge_Architecture_Orchestration","315301284_Mobile_Edge_Computing_Potential_in_Making_Cities_Smarter","313454524_On_Using_SDN_in_5G_The_Controller_Placement_Problem","311778510_A_Two-Level_Game_Theory_Approach_for_Joint_Relay_Selection_and_Resource_Allocation_in_Network_Coding_Assisted_D2D_Communications","311159311_Understanding_Mobile_Traffic_Patterns_of_Large_Scale_Cellular_Towers_in_Urban_Environment","309306029_Anything_as_a_Service_for_5G_Mobile_Systems","305705608_A_hierarchical_edge_cloud_architecture_for_mobile_computing","305675954_On_using_bargaining_game_for_Optimal_Placement_of_SDN_controllers","302982013_Robust_Energy-Efficient_MIMO_Transmission_for_Cognitive_Vehicular_Networks","297608756_Delay-Optimized_Video_Traffic_Routing_in_Software-Defined_Inter-Datacenter_Networks","295832539_Vehicular_Fog_Computing_A_Viewpoint_of_Vehicles_As_the_Infrastructures","290526804_Energy-Aware_Traffic_Offloading_for_Green_Heterogeneous_Networks","288023014_Coping_With_Emerging_Mobile_Social_Media_Applications_Through_Dynamic_Service_Function_Chaining","282906344_Understanding_Mobile_Traffic_Patterns_of_Large_Scale_Cellular_Towers_in_Urban_Environment","282551870_Optimal_Base_Station_Scheduling_for_Device-to-Device_Communication_Underlaying_Cellular_Networks","281050551_Service-Aware_Network_Function_Placement_for_Efficient_Traffic_Handling_in_Carrier_Cloud","278049205_On_The_Computation_Offloading_at_Ad_Hoc_Cloudlet_Architecture_and_Service_Models","273391829_Mobility-Assisted_Opportunistic_Computation_Offloading","271481175_A_Markov_Decision_Process-based_Service_Migration_Procedure_for_Follow_Me_Cloud","271458204_An_Analytical_Model_for_Follow_Me_Cloud","266048119_Production_Planning_by_Mixed_Integer_Programming","254059664_Cognitive_Machine-to-Machine_Communications_Visions_and_Potentials_for_the_Smart_Grid","229058134_Convex_Optimization","221351797_CloneCloud_Elastic_execution_between_mobile_device_and_cloud","220688539_An_Introduction_to_Linear_and_Nonlinear_Programming"]}
