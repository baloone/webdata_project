{"id":"265498124_Interactions_of_Computability_and_Randomness","abstract":"We survey results relating the computability and randomness aspects of sets of natural numbers. Each aspect corresponds to several mathematical properties. Properties originally defined in very different ways are shown to coincide. For instance, lowness for ML-randomness is equivalent to K-triviality. We include some interactions of randomness with computable analysis. Mathematics Subject Classification (2010). 03D15, 03D32. Keywords. Algorithmic randomness, lowness property, K-triviality, cost function.","authors":["Andr√© Nies"],"meta":["September 2010","DOI:10.1142/9789814324359_0039"],"references":["319393405_An_Introduction_to_Kolmogorov_Complexity_and_Its_Applications","268019688_Turing_incomparability_in_Scott_sets","267720902_Applying_randomness_to_computability","316805467_An_Introduction_to_Kolmogorov_Complexity_and_Its_Applications","316747233_Calculus_of_Cost_Functions","291588677_The_differentiability_of_constructive_functions_of_weakly_bounded_variation_on_pseudo_numbers","291168505_A_class_of_incomplete_sets","281256105_A_refinement_of_lown_and_highn_for_the_re_degrees","269000444_On_the_Role_of_O'_in_Recursion_Theory","268770738_Relationships_Between_Reducibilities","267076797_Various_measures_of_complexity_for_finite_objects_axiomatic_description","267016018_On_the_Notion_of_Randomness","266556322_Simple_Proofs_of_Some_Theorems_on_High_Degrees_of_Unsolvability","266254828_On_Degrees_of_Unsolvability","266064318_Some_generalizations_of_a_fixed-point_theorem"]}
