{"id":"325481043_Advantages_of_eye-gaze_over_head-gaze-based_selection_in_virtual_and_augmented_reality_under_varying_field_of_views","abstract":"The current best practice for hands-free selection using Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR/AR) head-mounted displays is to use head-gaze for aiming and dwell-time or clicking for triggering the selection. There is an observable trend for new VR and AR devices to come with integrated eye-tracking units to improve rendering, to provide means for attention analysis or for social interactions. Eye-gaze has been successfully used for human-computer interaction in other domains, primarily on desktop computers. In VR/AR systems, aiming via eye-gaze could be significantly faster and less exhausting than via head-gaze.\nTo evaluate benefits of eye-gaze-based interaction methods in VR and AR, we compared aiming via head-gaze and aiming via eye-gaze. We show that eye-gaze outperforms head-gaze in terms of speed, task load, required head movement and user preference. We furthermore show that the advantages of eye-gaze further increase with larger FOV sizes.","authors":["Jonas Blattgerste","Patrick Renner","Thies Pfeiffer"],"meta":["June 2018","DOI:10.1145/3206343.3206349","Conference: the Workshop","Project: Mixed Reality Performance Assistance"],"references":["327955283_Bestimmung_von_Nutzerpraferenzen_fur_Augmented-Reality_Systeme_durch_Prototyping_in_einer_Virtual-Reality_Simulation","320315146_The_eyes_don't_have_it_an_empirical_comparison_of_head-based_and_eye-based_selection_in_virtual_reality","273971132_Attention_Engagement_and_Cognitive_State_Analysis_for_Augmented_Reality_Text_Display_Functions","232628030_Simulation_of_Augmented_Reality_Systems_in_Purely_Virtual_Environments","221514774_The_Aligned_Rank_Transform_for_Nonparametric_Factorial_Analyses_Using_Only_ANOVA_Procedures","221221314_A_Replication_Study_Testing_the_Validity_of_AR_Simulation_in_VR_for_Controlled_Experiments","220810980_Gaze_typing_compared_with_input_by_head_and_hand","215604988_Comparing_Gaze-based_and_Manual_Interaction_in_a_Fast-paced_Gaming_Task_in_Virtual_Reality","320009899_Combining_virtual_reality_and_mobile_eye_tracking_to_provide_a_naturalistic_experimental_environment_for_shopper_research","314824198_Application_of_Fitts'_law_to_eye_gaze_interaction","290483874_Eye_tracking_eye-based_human-computer_interaction","281490778_Mobile_Augmented_Reality","277195404_Requirements_for_Virtualization_of_AR_Displays_within_VR_Environments","273232313_LOWESS_A_Program_for_Smoothing_Scatterplots_by_Robust_Locally_Weighted_Regression","268242663_Modern_Applied_Statistics_With_S-Plus","262408386_Foveated_3D_Graphics","246111301_Evaluation_of_Eye_Gaze_Interaction_Techniques","235689122_The_Effects_of_Visual_Realism_on_Search_Tasks_in_Mixed_Reality_Simulation","234831887_Gaze-directed_volume_rendering","234820692_An_evaluation_of_an_eye_tracker_as_a_device_for_computer_input2","234807312_Application_of_Fitt's_Law_to_Eye_Gaze_Interaction","221517772_Gaze-vs_hand-based_pointing_in_Virtual_Environments","221514279_What_you_look_at_is_what_you_get_eye_movement-based_interaction_techniques","221402686_The_Role_of_Latency_in_the_Validity_of_AR_Simulation","221221178_Wearable_augmented_reality_system_using_gaze_interaction","220606821_Special_issue_Communication_by_gaze_interaction","216813908_Hands_Free_Interaction_with_Virtual_Information_in_a_Real_Environment_Eye_Gaze_as_an_Interaction_Tool_in_an_Augmented_Reality_System","216301617_Modern_applied_statistics_with_S-PLUS","213799223_Fitts'_Law_as_a_Research_and_Design_Tool_in_Human-Computer_Interaction","21752413_The_Information_Capacity_of_the_Human_Motor_System_in_Controlling_the_Amplitude_of_Movement","4355629_Virtual_Reality_Simulation_for_Prototyping_Augmented_Reality","2405260_Interacting_With_Eye_Movements_In_Virtual_Environments","2243094_Effects_of_Field_of_View_on_Performance_with_Head-Mounted_Displays"]}
