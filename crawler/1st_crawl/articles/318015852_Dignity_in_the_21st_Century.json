{"id":"318015852_Dignity_in_the_21st_Century","abstract":"Dignity is a highly controversial concept. Few other terms have been used in so many settings with so many contradictory meanings. Political events in the Middle East have given dignity new meanings. Some analysts have gone as far as calling the revolutions and civil wars that have dominated this region in the early 21st century the ‘dignity revolutions’. With this book we want to show that the concept of dignity can be meaningfully employed in politics, philosophy and everyday life, if one is clear about its different meanings, and about which of those meanings to use in what context.","authors":["Doris Schroeder","Abol‐Hassan Bani-Sadr"],"meta":["January 2017","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-58020-3","ISBN: 978-3-319-58019-7"],"references":["274913651_Global_Justice","354766944_The_dignity_of_the_human_person_Towards_an_evangelical_reading_of_the_theology_of_personhood_of_Vatican_II","345226791_Kant_Groundwork_of_the_Metaphysics_of_Morals","341783733_Dignity_and_Practical_Reason_in_Kant's_Moral_Theory","306257541_Women_and_Human_Development_The_Capabilities_Approach","288394143_Torture_and_the_Ticking_Bomb","271093278_Party_of_One_Selected_Writings_of_Clifton_Fadiman","270327948_Crime_and_Punishment","259927334_Human_Rights_and_Human_Dignity_An_Appeal_to_Separate_the_Conjoined_Twins","259433587_The_Arab_Spring_Two_Years_On_Reflections_on_Dignity_Democracy_and_Devotion","250147487_Concurring_Visions_Human_Dignity_in_the_Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms_and_the_Basic_Law_of_the_Federal_Republic_of_Germany","249234341_Building_a_Culture_of_Life_A_Catholic_Perspective","248022485_The_Story_of_an_African_Farm","244428452_Groundwork_of_the_Metaphysics_of_Morals","238792343_Critique_of_Pure_Reason_trans"]}
