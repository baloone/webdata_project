{"id":"51888121_The_distribution_of_cycles_in_breakpoint_graphs_of_signed_permutations","abstract":"Breakpoint graphs are ubiquitous structures in the field of genome\nrearrangements. Their cycle decomposition has proved useful in computing and\nbounding many measures of (dis)similarity between genomes, and studying the\ndistribution of those cycles is therefore critical to gaining insight on the\ndistributions of the genomic distances that rely on it. We extend here the work\ninitiated by Doignon and Labarre, who enumerated unsigned permutations whose\nbreakpoint graph contains $k$ cycles, to signed permutations, and prove\nexplicit formulas for computing the expected value and the variance of the\ncorresponding distributions, both in the unsigned case and in the signed case.\nWe also compare these distributions to those of several well-studied distances,\nemphasising the cases where approximations obtained in this way stand out.\nFinally, we show how our results can be used to derive simpler proofs of other\npreviously known results.","authors":["Simona Grusea","Anthony Labarre"],"meta":["July 2013Discrete Applied Mathematics 161(10-11):1448-1466","DOI:10.1016/j.dam.2013.02.002","SourcearXiv","Project: Enumerative combinatorics"],"references":["280445715_The_On-Line_Encyclopedia_of_Integer_Sequences","292019240_Annals_of_Mathematical_Statistics","268650100_Symmetric_functions_and_Hall_polynomials_2nd_ed","268243473_Some_combinatorial_aspects_of_the_spectra_of_normally_distributed_random_matrices","266706614_Combinatorics_of_Coxeter_Groups","265545780_Genus_polynomials_of_dipoles","265427612_Finite_Permutation_Groups","236656646_Symmetric_Functions_and_Hall_Polynomials","228792852_Identities_involving_reciprocals_of_binomial_coefficients","223925415_On_the_problem_of_sorting_burnt_pancakes"]}
