{"id":"349171529_Exploring_data-in-use_the_value_of_data_for_Local_Government","abstract":"The power of data to support digital transformation within the context of e-Government is frequently underestimated. In this exploratory research, we develop a conceptual framework where the value of data stems from how it is used. We claim that the impact of digital transformation in the public sector presupposes an organisational culture that recognises and values data-in-use, by which is meant the practical application of data for a specific purpose, particularly by staff who deliver services. Through the lens of two ‘worldviews’ of data sharing, we present case studies of data use in two local authorities in Scotland. We claim that developing a culture where data is leveraged to derive insights for organisational activity requires combining working practices and technical infrastructure that centre on co-creating value with data. The presence of data intermediaries can support effective data-in-use to establish a healthy internal data ecosystem. Our research illustrates that local authorities within Scotland are still at an early stage of developing this culture.","authors":["Lucille Tetley-Brown","Ewan Klein"],"meta":["February 2021","DOI:10.3224/dms.v14i1.07"],"references":["339947001_Unpacking_the_Difference_Between_Digital_Transformation_and_IT-Enabled_Organizational_Transformation","331678652_Close_encounters_of_the_digital_kind_A_research_agenda_for_the_digitalization_of_public_services","331183566_Participatory_Action_Research_Theory_and_Methods_for_Engaged_Inquiry","330071509_Investigations_into_Data_Ecosystems_a_systematic_mapping_study","329869898_Delivering_Smart_Governance_in_a_Future_City_The_Case_of_Glasgow","345049369_Urban_data_and_city_dashboards","326166621_From_Toddler_to_Teen_Growth_of_an_Open_Data_Ecosystem_-_A_longitudinal_analysis_of_Open_Data_developments_in_the_UK","321369904_ICT_E-Government_and_E-Governance_Bits_Bytes_for_Public_Administration","320597252_Data_quality_management_past_present_and_future_Towards_a_management_system_for_data","309918175_Measuring_Digital_Government_How_to_Assess_and_Compare_Digitalisation_in_Public_Sector_Organisations"]}
