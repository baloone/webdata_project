The mobile application for time attendance face recognition, using application need to fill in and take a photo of the face before being able to sign in. Then take a picture with a straight face so the system will detect the face. Then press the photo shoot 5 shots. The signature must be the same as the face to detect the face and press the scan button. To wait for the information to be displayed on the information verification on screen. This verification will display the ID, time to use, and show the current GPS address. When you have checked, then click save button to save the time entered into the database. The experiment results show that the application of the developed application has been tested. The application can recognize faces accuracy 100%.","authors":["Wiyada Yawai","Khwanruethai Sirichinda","Phanachai Banchongrot"],"meta":["November 2018Journal of Theoretical and Applied Information Technology 4(1):29-36"],"references":["233864740_Face_Recognition_A_Literature_Review","224683961_The_Facial_Features_Extraction_for_Face_Recognition_Based_on_Geometrical_Approach"]}
