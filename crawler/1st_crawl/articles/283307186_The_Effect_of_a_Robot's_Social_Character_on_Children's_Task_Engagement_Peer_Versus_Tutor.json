{"id":"283307186_The_Effect_of_a_Robot's_Social_Character_on_Children's_Task_Engagement_Peer_Versus_Tutor","abstract":"An increasing number of applications for social robots focuses on learning and playing with children. One of the unanswered questions is what kind of social character a robot should have in order to positively engage children in a task. In this paper, we present a study on the effect of two different social characters of a robot (peer vs. tutor) on children’s task engagement. We derived peer and tutor robot behaviors from the literature and we evaluated the two robot characters in a WoZ study where 10 pairs of children aged 6 to 9 played Tangram puzzles with a Nao robot. Our results show that in the peer character condition, children paid attention to the robot and the task for a longer period of time and solved the puzzles quicker and better than in the tutor character condition.","authors":["Cristina Zaga","Manja Lohse","Khiet Truong","Vanessa Evers"],"meta":["October 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-25554-5_70","Conference: Social Robotics - Proceeding 7th International Conference, ICSR 2015 Paris, France, October 26–30At: ParisVolume: 9388","Project: Squirrel (Clearing Clutter Bit by Bit) "],"references":["310773130_Handbook_of_Student_Engagement","272794489_The_Robot_Who_Tried_Too_Hard_Social_Behaviour_of_a_Robot_Tutor_Can_Negatively_Affect_Child_Learning","272712473_Designing_Adaptive_Roles_for_Socially_Assistive_Robots_A_New_Method_to_Reduce_Technological_Determinism_and_Role_Stereotypes","260361337_Child-Robot_Interaction_Perspectives_and_Challenges","242073371_Children_as_Respondents_in_Survey_Research_Cognitive_Development_and_Response_Quality_1","300994638_Expectations","278666258_Handbook_of_Research_on_Student_Engagement","278086326_Empathic_Robots_for_Long-term_Interaction","260843750_Social-Task_Engagement_Striking_a_Balance_between_the_Robot_and_the_Task","249797781_School_Engagement_Potential_of_the_Concept_State_of_the_Evidence"]}
