{"id":"311491254_TaxiRec_recommending_road_clusters_to_taxi_drivers_using_ranking-based_extreme_learning_machines","abstract":"Utilizing large-scale GPS data to improve taxi services becomes a popular research problem in the areas of data mining, intelligent transportation, and the Internet of Things. In this paper, we utilize a large-scale GPS data set generated by over 7,000 taxis in a period of one month in Nanjing, China, and propose TaxiRec; a framework for discovering the passenger-finding potentials of road clusters, which is incorporated into a recommender system for taxi drivers to hunt passengers. In TaxiRec, we first construct the road network by defining the nodes and road segments. Then, the road network is divided into a number of road clusters through a clustering process on the mid points of the road segments. Afterwards, a set of features for each road cluster is extracted from real-life data sets, and a ranking-based extreme learning machine (ELM) model is proposed to evaluate the passenger-finding potential of each road cluster. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed framework.","authors":["Ran Wang","Chi-Yin Chow","Yan Lyu","Victor C. S.
