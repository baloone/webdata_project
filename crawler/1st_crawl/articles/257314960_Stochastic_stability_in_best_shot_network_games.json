{"id":"257314960_Stochastic_stability_in_best_shot_network_games","abstract":"The best shot game applied to networks is a discrete model of many processes of contribution to local public goods. It generally has a wide multiplicity of equilibria that we refine through stochastic stability. We show that, depending on how we define perturbations – i.e., possible mistakes that agents make – we can obtain very different sets of stochastically stable states. In particular and non-trivially, if we assume that the only possible source of error is that of a contributing agent that stops doing so, then the only stochastically stable states are Nash equilibria with the largest contribution.","authors":["Leonardo Boncinelli","Paolo Pin"],"meta":["July 2012Games and Economic Behavior 75(2):538–554","DOI:10.1016/j.geb.2012.03.001"],"references":["43020212_Statistical_mechanics_of_maximal_independent_sets","5021079_Network_Games","4795248_The_Economics_Of_Traffic_Congestion","312454318_The_evolution_of_conventions","274861256_Evolutionary_Game_Theory","260422757_A_Law_of_Comparative_Judgment","243777612_Individual_Strategy_and_Social_Structure","232421807_The_Evolution_of_Conventions","230786735_Conditional_Logit_Analysis_of_Qualitative_Choice_Behavior","227606308_Who's_Who_in_Networks_Wanted_The_Key_Player","226530329_From_Weakest-Link_to_Best-Shot_The_Voluntary_Provision_of_Public_Goods","222662166_Public_Goods_in_Networks","222483591_Stochastic_Evolutionary_Game_Theory","222445573_Quantal_Response_Equilibria_in_Normal_Form_Games","222436546_The_Worst-Case_Time_Complexity_for_Generating_All_Maximal_Cliques_and_Computational_Experiments","222397941_The_Evolution_of_Exchange_by","46466535_Evolution_with_State-Dependent_Mutations","45901911_Optimal_Equilibria_of_the_Best_Shot_Game","23573695_Evolutionary_Games_and_Equilibrium_Selection","5020085_The_Law_of_the_Few","4977052_Stochastic_Stability_in_Games_with_Alternative_Best_Replies","4898442_Learning_Mutation_And_Long_Run_Equilibria_In_Games","4896180_Evolution_with_State-Dependent_Mutations","4820442_The_Theory_of_Learning_in_Games","4783361_Basins_of_Attraction_Long-Run_Stochastic_Stability_and_the_Speed_of_Step-by-Step_Evolution","4767703_The_Statistical_Mechanics_of_Strategic_Interaction","4719871_Models_of_Segregation","2332100_How_Noise_Matters"]}
