{"id":"221591306_Optimal_approximation_for_the_Submodular_Welfare_Problem_in_the_value_oracle_model","abstract":"In the Submodular Welfare Problem, m items are to be distributed among n players with utility functions wi: 2[m] → R+. The utility functions are assumed to be monotone and submodular. Assuming that player i receives a set of items Si, we wish to maximize the total utility ∑i=1ⁿ wi(Si). In this paper, we work in the value oracle model where the only access to the utility functions is through a black box returning wi(S) for a given set S. Submodular Welfare is in fact a special case of the more general problem of submodular maximization subject to a matroid constraint: max{f(S): S ∈ I}, where f is monotone submodular and I is the collection of independent sets in some matroid.\nFor both problems, a greedy algorithm is known to yield a 1/2-approximation [21, 16]. In special cases where the matroid is uniform (I = S: |S| ≤ k) [20] or the submodular function is of a special type [4, 2], a (1-1/e)-approximation has been achieved and this is optimal for these problems in the value oracle model [22, 6, 15]. A (1-1/e)-approximation for the general Submodular Welfare Problem has been known only in a stronger demand oracle model [4], where in fact 1-1/e can be improved [9].\nIn this paper, we develop a randomized continuous greedy algorithm which achieves a (1-1/e)-approximation for the Submodular Welfare Problem in the value oracle model. We also show that the special case of n equal players is approximation resistant, in the sense that the optimal (1-1/e)-approximation is achieved by a uniformly random solution. Using the pipage rounding technique [1, 2], we obtain a (1-1/e)-approximation for submodular maximization subject to any matroid constraint. The continuous greedy algorithm has a potential of wider applicability, which we demonstrate on the examples of the Generalized Assignment Problem and the AdWords Assignment Problem.","authors":["Jan Vondrák"],"meta":["May 2008Proceedings of the Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing","DOI:10.1145/1374376.1374389","SourceDBLP","Conference: Proceedings of the 40th Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, May 17-20, 2008"],"references":["242914003_An_Analysis_of_Approximations_for_Maximizing_Submodular_Set_Functions-I","230595717_Combinatorial_Optimization_Polyhedra_and_Efficiency","228573763_Revisiting_the_greedy_approach_to_submodular_set_function_maximization","221444866_Tight_information-theoretic_lower_bounds_for_welfare_maximization_in_combinatorial_auctions","220779502_On_Rectangle_Packing_Maximizing_Benefits","304425177_Pipage_Rounding_A_New_Method_of_Constructing_Algorithms_with_Proven_Performance_Guarantee","285127877_Submodular_functions_and_convexity","266987069_Mathematical_Programming_The_State_of_the_Art","251351298_Clique_is_hard_to_approximate_within","242929727_Maximising_Real-Valued_Submodular_Functions_Primal_and_Dual_Heuristics_for_Location_Problems","239534896_A_threshold_of_In_n_for_approximating_set_cover","238836027_Best_Algorithms_for_Approximating_the_Maximum_of_a_Submodular_Set_Function","232619366_Clique_is_hard_to_approximate_within_n1_-_E","226715030_Pipage_Rounding_A_New_Method_of_Constructing_Algorithms_with_Proven_Performance_Guarantee","225822232_Inapproximability_Results_for_Combinatorial_Auctions_with_Submodular_Utility_Functions","225246148_An_analysis_of_approximations_for_maximizing_submodular_set_functions-II","225160529_Inapproximability_Results_for_Combinatorial_Auctions_with_Submodular_Utility_Functions","224678314_Approximation_algorithms_for_allocation_problems_Improving_the_factor_of_1_-_1e","222514750_A_Combinatorial_Algorithm_Minimizing_Submodular_Functions_in_Strongly_Polynomial_Time","222420378_Combinatorial_Auctions_with_Decreasing_Marginal_Utilities","221591477_A_Combinatorial_Strongly_Polynomial-Time_Algorithm_for_Minimizing_Submodular_Functions","221462795_Maximum_Coverage_Problem_with_Group_Budget_Constraints_and_Applications","221369171_Submodular_Functions_Matroids_and_Certain_Polyhedra","221317013_Maximizing_a_Submodular_Set_Function_Subject_to_a_Matroid_Constraint_Extended_Abstract","220779129_Tight_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Maximum_General_Assignment_Problems","220778896_An_improved_approximation_algorithm_for_combinatorial_auctions_with_submodular_bidders","220618371_Maximizing_Non-Monotone_Submodular_Functions","220617235_On_Maximizing_Welfare_When_Utility_Functions_Are_Subadditive","220430827_A_combinatorial_strongly_polynomial_algorithm_for_minimizing_submodular_functions","220138821_Linear_Degree_Extractors_and_the_Inapproximability_of_Max_Clique_and_Chromatic_Number","220059792_A_note_on_maximizing_a_submodular_set_function_subject_to_a_knapsack_constraint","4294358_Inapproximability_Results_for_Sparsest_Cut_Optimal_Linear_Arrangement_and_Precedence_Constrained_Scheduling","2323065_A_Threshold_of_Ln_N_for_Approximating_Set_Cover"]}
