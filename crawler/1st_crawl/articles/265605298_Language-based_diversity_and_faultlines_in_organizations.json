{"id":"265605298_Language-based_diversity_and_faultlines_in_organizations","abstract":"Language-based diversity is a relatively understudied area within diversity research. Drawing upon the social identity-based fault lines literature, the present paper describes the effects of language-based diversity within organizations operating in India. Interview-based findings indicate that organizationally mandated languages are occasionally disregarded by employees in both national and multinational organizations. Respondents noted how even benign and momentary language switching can lead to the formation of language-based groups and cause negative consequences such as feelings of being devalued. Respondents also noted strategies that let them attenuate negative effects of multilingualism while simultaneously leveraging its benefits. Overall, the present study indicates that momentary exclusion based on incomprehensible language, when experienced on a daily basis, may have a far-reaching influence on individual and team functioning. Findings thus point to language use as a trigger that can activate social identity-based fault lines.
