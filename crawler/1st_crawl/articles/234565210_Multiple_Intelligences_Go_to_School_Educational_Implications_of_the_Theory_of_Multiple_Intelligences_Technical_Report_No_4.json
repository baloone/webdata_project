The theory of multiple intelligences (MI), proposed in 1983 by H. Gardner, suggests the existence of several relatively autonomous human intelligences. Intelligence is defined as the capacity to solve problems or to fashion products that are valued in one or more cultural settings. A provisional list includes seven intelligences: (1) logical-mathematical; (2) linguistic; (3) musical; (4) spatial; (5) bodily-kinesthetic; (6) interpersonal; and (7) intrapersonal. In MI theory, intelligences are always conceptualized and assessed in terms of their cultural manifestation in specific domains of endeavor and with reference to particular adult end-states. Some projects developing out of MI theory, including Pittsburgh's Arts PROPEL program, are summarized; and preliminary findings are reviewed from Project Spectrum, a program that has developed several curriculum activities and assessment options suited to the child-centered structure of many schools and preschools. The 15 activities of Project Spectrum tap particular intelligences or sets of intelligences. Preliminary findings provide some support for the MI theory in that children aged 3 to 7 years exhibit distinct profiles of relative intellectual strengths and weaknesses. Areas for further research are described. A 53-item list of references is included.
