{"id":"315318773_A_survey_on_managing_users'_preferences_in_ambient_intelligence","abstract":"Understanding the importance of preference management in ambient intelligent environments is key to providing systems that are better prepared to meet users’ expectations. This survey provides an account of the various ways that preferences have been handled in Artificial Intelligence. Our analysis indicates that most of those techniques lack the ability to handle ambiguity and the evolution of preferences over time. Further exploration shows that argumentation can provide a feasible solution to complement existing work. We illustrate our claim by using an intelligent environment case study.","authors":["Chimezie Leonard Oguego","Juan Carlos Augusto Wrede","Andrés Muñoz","Mark Springett"],"meta":["March 2018Universal Access in the Information Society 17(2)","DOI:10.1007/s10209-017-0527-y","Projects: Preferences within Intelligent Environment Systemsprojects by the GOODIES"],"references":["286662630_Reflections_on_Ambient_Intelligence_Systems_Handling_of_User_Preferences_and_Needs","281281002_Preferences_in_Artificial_Intelligence","278965174_Integrating_TCP-Nets_and_CSPs_The_constrained_TCP-Net_CTCP-Net_model","304291845_A_New_Proposal_to_Represent_the_Linguistic_Conditional_Preference_Networks","300114343_Advancing_Ambient_Assisted_Living_with_Caution","287705392_Making_CP-nets_more_useful","287625920_Introducing_ontological_CP-nets","284667394_Instants_and_intervals","283480815_Resolving_conflicts_in_knowledge_for_ambient_intelligence","280078800_Logical_models_of_argument","278663403_Sensors_for_Ambient_Assisted_Living_and_Smart_Homes","276275737_Preferences_in_Artificial_Intelligence","270793368_Intelligent_Environments_a_manifesto","266914930_Night_optimised_care_technology_for_users_needing_assisted_lifestyles","269088914_A_linguistic_approach_for_non-functional_constraints_in_a_semantic_SOA_environment"]}
