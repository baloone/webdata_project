{"id":"308823613_Some_Families_of_Trees_Arising_in_Permutation_Analysis","abstract":"We extend classical results on simple varieties of trees (asymptotic enumeration, average behavior of tree parameters) to trees counted by their number of leaves. Motivated by genome comparison of related species, we then apply these results to strong interval trees with a restriction on the arity of prime nodes. Doing so, we describe a filtration of the set of permutations based on their strong interval trees. This filtration is also studied from a purely analytical point of view, thus illustrating the convergence of analytic series towards a non-analytic limit at the level of the asymptotic behavior of their coefficients.","authors":["Mathilde Bouvel","Marni Mishna","Cyril Nicaud"],"meta":["September 2016The Electronic Journal of Combinatorics 27(2)","DOI:10.37236/6504"],"references":["221543529_Revisiting_T_Uno_and_M_Yagiura's_Algorithm","221314136_Finding_All_Common_Intervals_of_k_Permutations","220533232_Computing_Common_Intervals_of_K_Permutations_with_Applications_to_Modular_Decomposition_of_Graphs","280817991_Revisiting_Uno_and_Yagiura's_Algorithms","267472279_Some_simple_varieties_of_trees_arising_in_permutation_analysis_Extended_abstract","222669280_Simple_permutations_and_pattern_restricted_permutations","222125111_Testing_for_the_Consecutive_Ones_Property_Interval_Graphs_and_Graph_Planarity_Using_PQ-Tree_Algorithms","221313807_Average-Case_Analysis_of_Perfect_Sorting_by_Reversals","220693528_Analytic_Combinatorics","220077730_1_Introduction_Symmetric_Functions_and_P-Recursiveness"]}
