{"id":"322809342_The_Relationship_Between_g_-Restricted_Connectivity_and_g_-Good-Neighbor_Fault_Diagnosability_of_General_Regular_Networks","abstract":"The $g$ -restricted connectivity ( $g$ -RC) is the minimum vertex-set size of a network, whose deletion disconnects the network such that each remaining vertex has at least $g$ neighbors in its respective component. The $g$ -RC is a deterministic indicator of tolerability of a network with failing processors. The $g$ -good-neighbor fault diagnosability ( $g$ -GNFD) is the largest set size of correctly identified faulty vertices in a network such that any good vertex has no fewer $g$ good neighbors. This paper establishes the relationship between $g$ -RC and $g$ -GNFD of general regular networks, first under the PMC model and second under the MM* model. Moreover, this paper directly gives the $g$ -GNFD of some well-known special networks by their $g$ -RC and our proposed relationship.","authors":["Limei Lin","Sun-Yuan Hsieh","Riqing Chen","li xu"],"meta":["January 2018IEEE Transactions on Reliability PP(99):1-12","DOI:10.1109/TR.2017.2760905"],"references":["300222496_First-Priority_Relation_Graph-Based_Malicious_Users_Detection_in_Mobile_Social_Networks","288658884_The_tk-Diagnosability_for_Regular_Networks","284142960_A_comparison_connection_assignment_for_self-diagnosis_of_multiprocessor_systems","272385924_The_Extra_Restricted_Connectivity_and_Conditional_Diagnosability_of_Split-Star_Networks","264580140_A_Tabu_Search_Algorithm_for_the_Location_of_Data_Centers_and_Software_Components_in_Green_Cloud_Computing_Networks","233426980_Generalized_Measures_of_Fault_Tolerance_in_Exchanged_Hypercubes","3637910_Bubblesort_star_graphs_a_new_interconnection_network","3044866_Conditional_diagnosability_measures_for_large_multiprocessor_systems","3043255_Conditional_Connectivity_Measures_for_Large_Multiprocessor_Systems","308866525_A_predictive_scheduling_framework_for_fast_and_distributed_stream_data_processing","308532539_h-restricted_connectivity_of_locally_twisted_cubes","305485422_The_-Good-Neighbor_Conditional_Diagnosability_of_Arrangement_Graphs","304144537_Trustworthiness-Hypercube-based_Reliable_Communication_in_Mobile_Social_Networks","267180757_Conditional_connectivity_for_nk-arrangement_graph","262399905_A_kind_of_conditional_fault_tolerance_of_nk-star_graphs","261057595_Sensor_Fault_Diagnosis_for_Improving_the_Availability_of_Electrical_Drives","260712225_Hypercube-Based_Multipath_Social_Feature_Routing_in_Human_Contact_Networks","260585635_Reliability_Evaluation_of_BC_Networks","260411228_Generalized_measures_for_fault_tolerance_of_star_networks","257294005_Generalized_measures_of_fault_tolerance_in_hypercube_networks","254031851_Social_feature-based_multi-path_routing_in_delay_tolerant_networks","235737467_Algebraic_Connectivity_of_Graphs","235246878_A_kind_of_conditional_vertex_connectivity_of_Cayley_graphs_generated_by_2-trees","235221604_A_kind_of_conditional_vertex_connectivity_of_star_graphs","222712643_Complex_networks_Structure_and_dynamics","221936340_A_Fault_Diagnosis_and_Security_Framework_for_Water_Systems","221388879_On_self-diagnosable_multiprocessor_systems_diagnosis_by_the_comparison_approach","220115200_Conditional_connectivity_of_Cayley_graphs_generated_by_transposition_trees","3477231_On_the_Connection_Assignment_Problem_of_Diagnosable_Systems","3042531_Generalized_measure_of_fault_tolerance_with_application_to_N-cubes"]}
