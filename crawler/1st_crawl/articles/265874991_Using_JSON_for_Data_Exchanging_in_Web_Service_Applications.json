{"id":"265874991_Using_JSON_for_Data_Exchanging_in_Web_Service_Applications","abstract":"XML is the de facto standard format for data exchanging in the context of web service applications. While as has been semi-structured, XML data has to be parsed before being processed at both the client and the server sides. Applications show that the parsing process of XML is quilt time and memory consuming, such as DOM needs to load the whole XML document into memory before processing the data. Compared with XML, JSON is a light-weight key-value style data ex-changing format. As we know, the efficiency of mapping data between different data models is the key point to improve the performance of web service applications. In this work, a data model mapping approach, named as Dynamic Advanced Binding (DAB), is proposed for processing JSON data. This approach efficiently maps the JSON data onto the host lan-guage (such as Java) by dynamically building the Data Mapping Template (DMT) during the runtime. The DMTs are spe-cified by extending context-free grammar and implemented with a pushdown automaton with output. The experiments are conducted to verify the performance of the proposed approach.","authors":["Dunlu Peng","Lidong Cao","Wenjie Xu"],"meta":["December 2011"],"references":["221023583_Evaluating_SOAP_for_High_Performance_Business_Applications_Real-Time_Trading_Systems","2380841_Latency_Performance_of_SOAP_Implementations","292243674_High_performance_SOAP_processing_based_on_dynamic_template-driven_mechanism"]}
