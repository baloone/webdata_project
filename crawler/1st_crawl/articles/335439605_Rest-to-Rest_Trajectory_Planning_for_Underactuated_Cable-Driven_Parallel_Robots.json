{"id":"335439605_Rest-to-Rest_Trajectory_Planning_for_Underactuated_Cable-Driven_Parallel_Robots","abstract":"This article studies the trajectory planning for underactuated cable-driven parallel robots (CDPRs) in the case of rest-to-rest motions, when both the motion time and the path geometry are prescribed. For underactuated manipulators, it is possible to prescribe a control law only for a subset of the generalized coordinates of the system. However, if an arbitrary trajectory is prescribed for a suitable subset of these coordinates, the constraint deficiency on the end-effector leads to the impossibility of bringing the system at rest in a prescribed time. In addition, the behavior of the system may not be stable, that is, unbounded oscillatory motions of the end-effector may arise. In this article, we propose a novel trajectory-planning technique that allows the end effector to track a constrained geometric path in a specified time, and allows it to transition between stable static poses. The design of such a motion is based on the solution of a boundary value problem, aimed at a finding solution to the differential equations of motion with constraints on position and velocity at start and end times. To prove the effectiveness of such a method, the trajectory planning of a six-degrees-of-freedom spatial CDPR suspended by three cables is investigated. Trajectories of a reference point on the moving platform are designed so as to ensure that the assigned path is tracked accurately, and the system is brought to a static condition in a prescribed time. Experimental validation is presented and discussed.","authors":["Edoardo Id√†","Tobias Bruckmann","Marco Carricato"],"meta":["August 2019IEEE Transactions on Robotics
