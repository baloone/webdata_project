{"id":"315764651_A_Survey_of_Distributed_Message_Broker_Queues","abstract":"This paper surveys the message brokers that are in vogue today for distributed communication. Their primary goal is to facilitate the construction of decentralized topologies without single points of failure, enabling fault tolerance and high availability. These characteristics make them optimal for usage within distributed architectures. However, there are multiple protocols built to achieve this, and it would be beneficial to have a empirical comparison between their features and performance to determine their real-world applicability. This paper focuses on two popular protocols (Kafka and AMQP) and explores the divergence in their features as well as their performance under varied testing workloads.","authors":["Vineet John","Xia Liu"],"meta":["April 2017"],"references":["221234127_A_Case_for_Message_Oriented_Middleware"]}
