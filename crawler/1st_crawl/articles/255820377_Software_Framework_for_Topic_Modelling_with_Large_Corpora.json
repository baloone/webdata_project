{"id":"255820377_Software_Framework_for_Topic_Modelling_with_Large_Corpora","abstract":"Large corpora are ubiquitous in today’s world and memory quickly becomes the limiting factor in practical applications of the Vector Space Model (VSM). In this paper, we identify a gap in existing implementations of many of the popular algorithms, which is their scalability and ease of use. We describe a Natural Language Processing software framework which is based on the idea of document streaming, i.e. processing corpora document after document, in a memory independent fashion. Within this framework, we implement several popular algorithms for topical inference, including Latent Semantic Analysis and Latent Dirichlet Allocation, in a way that makes them completely independent of the training corpus size. Particular emphasis is placed on straightforward and intuitive framework design, so that modifications and extensions of the methods and/or their application by interested practitioners are effortless. We demonstrate the\nusefulness of our approach on a real-world scenario of computing document similarities within an existing digital library DML-CZ.","authors":["Radim Řehůřek","Petr Sojka"],"meta":["May 2010","DOI:10.13140/2.1.2393.1847","Conference: Proceedings of the LREC 2010 Workshop on New Challenges for NLP FrameworksAt: Malta"],"references":["267448270_Introduction_to_the_Special_Issue_on_the_Web_as_Corpus","264630088_Probabilistic_Topic_Models_A_focus_on_graphical_model_design_and_applications_to_document_and_image_analysis","243763293_SVMLight_Support_Vector_Machine","225876490_Orange_From_Experimental_Machine_Learning_to_Interactive_Data_Mining","221997021_Hierarchical_Dirichlet_Processes","303802749_Indexing_by_Latent_Semantic_Analysis","228057706_Indexing_By_Latent_Semantic_Analysis","226020357_GATE_a_General_Architecture_for_Text_Engineering","222668319_Brand_M_Fast_low-rank_modifications_of_the_thin_singular_value_decomposition_Linear_Algebra_Appl_4151_20-30","222553452_Latent_Semantic_Indexing_A_Probabilistic_Analysis","221618226_Reading_Tea_Leaves_How_Humans_Interpret_Topic_Models","221300847_Vector_Space_Model_of_Information_Retrieval_-_A_Reevaluation","220875054_Pairwise_Document_Similarity_in_Large_Collections_with_MapReduce","220482883_NLTK_the_Natural_Language_Toolkit","220947044_Generalized_Hebbian_Algorithm_for_Incremental_Singular_Value_Decomposition_in_Natural_Language_Processing"]}
