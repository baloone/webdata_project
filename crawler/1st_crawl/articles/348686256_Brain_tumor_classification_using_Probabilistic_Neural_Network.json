{"id":"348686256_Brain_tumor_classification_using_Probabilistic_Neural_Network","abstract":"In the past few years, Cancer is one of the worst diseases in the world causing death of many people. MRI is one of the widely used imaging technique for detection and classification of brain tumors. The typical structure for this proposed system has four stages. The initial stage in the proposed system is the pre-processing using a Gaussian filter. FCM has been employed in the second stage for image segmentation. The third stage is the feature extraction of MRI images using Curvelet Transform. The fourth stage is a classification that classified the tumor of MRI images using a probabilistic neural network to benign and malignant. The recognition rate of this system is 98%.","authors":["Sami Hasan","Mays Yousif","Talib M J Al-Talib"],"meta":["January 2018Journal of Fundamental and Applied Sciences","DOI:10.4314/jfas.v10i4s.230"],"references":["350076026_FPGA_Implementations_for_Parallel_Multidimensional_Filtering_Algorithms","350075958_Rapidly-Fabricated_Architectures_of_Parallel_Multidimensional_Algorithms","340685686_MRI_BRAIN_IMAGE_SEGMENTATION_TECHNIQUES_-A_REVIEW","311317738_Performance-vetted_3-D_MAC_processors_for_parallel_volumetric_convolution_algorithm_A_25625620_MRI_filtering_case_study","282395855_Performance-Aware_Architectures_for_Parallel_4D_Color_fMRI_Filtering_Algorithm_A_Complete_Performance_Indices_Package","321320218_Brain_Tumor_detection_based_on_segmentation_of_MRI","309456244_Research_paper_on_basic_of_Artificial_Neural_Network","305549891_Efficient_analysis_of_medical_image_de-noising_for_MRI_and_ultrasound_images","282614208_A_novel_approach_for_brain_tumor_detection_using_neural_network","281429803_An_Efficient_Brain_Image_Classification_Using_Probabilistic_Neural_Network_and_Tumor_Detection_Using_Image_Processing"]}
