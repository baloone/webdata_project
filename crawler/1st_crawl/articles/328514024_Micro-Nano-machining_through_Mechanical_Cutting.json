{"id":"328514024_Micro-Nano-machining_through_Mechanical_Cutting","abstract":"Micro-/nano-cutting is one of the key technologies for fabricating micro-components. In micro-/nano-cutting, the factors that are considered to have little or no influence at large length-scale manufacturing become dominant at the micro-scale cutting with strong influences on the machined component, because the depth of cut is normally at the level of a micrometer or less. The mechanisms of micro-/nano-cutting are quite different from conventional cutting due to the small depth of cut involved. This chapter first introduces fundamentals of a micro-/nano-cutting process, and it then presents three commonly used simulation methods in micro-/nano-cutting analysis, i.e., finite element method, molecular dynamic simulation, and multiscale simulation. The chapter also covers precision machine topics, including ultraprecision machine tools and micro- and meso-machines that are indispensable in the implementation of micro-/nano-cutting. Finally, micro-tooling is discussed, followed by presenting some applications of micro-/nano-cutting.","authors":["X. Sun","K.
