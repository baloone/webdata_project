{"id":"324784757_Student_engagement_in_Indian_context_UWES-S_validation_and_relationship_with_burnout_and_life_satisfaction","abstract":"The student version of Utrecht work engagement scale (UWES-S) is increasingly being employed to assess student engagement without sufficient evidence for its validity, reliability and generalisability. This research seeks to investigate the psychometric properties of UWES-S in the Indian context. Two studies are reported. Study 1 (N = 207) investigates the 14-item UWES-S for factorial and convergent validity, and internal consistency. Study 2 (N = 279) revalidates findings from study 1 and examines relationships with burnout and life satisfaction. The three-factor morphology of UWES-S stands validated across both the studies. Evidence for convergent validity and internal consistency has been provided. The research also proposes a nine-item version of UWES-S based on psychometric properties and item analysis. Further, student engagement is found to be negatively associated with student burnout","authors":["Ashish Rastogi","Surya Prakash Pati","Pankaj Kumar","Jitendra KUMAR Dixit"],"meta":["January 2018International Journal of Work Organisation and Emotion 9(1):89","DOI:10.1504/IJWOE.2018.091340"],"references":["283159673_Motivation_in_the_Classroom_Reciprocal_Effects_of_Teacher_Behavior_and_Student_Engagement_Across_the_School_Year","281410496_Engagement_boredom_and_burnout_among_students_Basic_need_satisfaction_matters_more_than_personality_traits","271658617_What_future_for_student_engagement_in_neo-liberal_times","270820426_Making_Sense_of_Cronbach's_Alpha","325671640_On_the_dimensionality_of_organizational_justice_A_construct_validation_of_a_measure","306309114_The_Korean_utrecht_work_engagement_scale-student_UWES-S_A_factor_validation_study","299112721_The_Chinese_Ver_sion_of_Utr_echt_Wor_k_Engagement_Scale_An_Examination_of_Reliability_and_Validity","280298143_Student_Identity_Disengagement_and_Learning","272159642_The_Satisfaction_With_Life_Scale","269575428_Multivariate_Data_Analysis_With_Reading"]}
