{"id":"257000708_Further_generalizations_of_the_Wythoff_game_and_the_minimum_excludant","abstract":"Given non-negative integers aa and bb, we consider the following game WYT(a,b)WYT(a,b). Given two piles that consist of xx and yy matches, and two players having alternate turns; a single move consists of a player choosing x′x′ matches from one pile and y′y′ from the other such that 0≤x′≤x,0≤y′≤y,0<x′+y′,and[min(x′,y′)<b or |x′−y′|<a]. The player who takes the last match is the winner in the normal version of the game and the loser in its misère version.It is easy to verify that the cases (a=0,b=1),(a=b=1)(a=0,b=1),(a=b=1), and (b=1,∀a) correspond to the two-pile, Wythoff and Fraenkel NIM, respectively. The concept of the minimum excludant, mexmex, is known to be instrumental in solving the last two games. We generalize this concept by introducing a function mexbmexb (such that mex1=mexmex1=mex) to solve the normal and misère versions of the game WYT(a,b)WYT(a,b).","authors":["Vladimir Alexander Gurvich"],"meta":["May 2012Discrete Applied Mathematics 160(s 7–8):941–947","DOI:10.1016/j.dam.2012.01.009"],"references":["285696219_Uber_mathematische_Kampfspiele","285198043_Mathematics_and_games","268548877_A_Game_Based_on_the_Euclidean_Algorithm_and_a_Winning_Strategy_for_It","266223725_A_modification_of_the_game_of_Nim","257338000_A_polynomial_algorithm_for_a_two_parameter_extension_of_Wythoff_NIM_based_on_the_Perron-Frobenius_theory","251529524_More_on_the_Sprague-Grundy_function_for_Wythoff's_game","246951426_Nim_A_Game_with_a_Complete_Mathematical_Theory","246393327_How_to_Beat_Your_Wythoff_Games'_Opponent_on_Three_Fronts","243113601_On_misere_Nim-type_games","236853724_Winning_Ways_For_Your_Mathematical_Plays","233822853_The_Theory_of_Games_and_Economic_Behavior","226555675_On_sums_of_graph_games_with_last_player_losing","225233752_Wythoff_games_continued_fractions_cedar_trees_and_Fibonacci_searches","222379245_Wythoff_games_continued_fractions_cedar_trees_and_Fibonacci_searches","220194087_The_vile_dopey_evil_and_odious_game_players","220187805_Euclid_and_Wythoff_games","220187110_On_the_misere_version_of_game_Euclid_and_miserable_games","220155127_Correctnes_of_Programs_with_Pascal-Like_Procedures_without_Global_Variables","220153701_Wythoff_Games_Continued_Fractions_Cedar_Trees_and_Fibonacci_Searches","220150416_The_Sprague-Grundy_Function_for_Wythoff's_Game","220074496_Misere_Annihilation_Games"]}
