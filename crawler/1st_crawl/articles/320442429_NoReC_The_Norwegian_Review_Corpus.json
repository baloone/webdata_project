{"id":"320442429_NoReC_The_Norwegian_Review_Corpus","abstract":"This paper presents the Norwegian Review Corpus (NoReC), created for training and evaluating models for document-level sentiment analysis. The full-text reviews have been collected from major Norwegian news sources and cover a range of different domains, including literature, movies, video games, restaurants, music and theater, in addition to product reviews across a range of categories. Each review is labeled with a manually assigned score of 1-6, as provided by the rating of the original author. This first release of the corpus comprises more than 35,000 reviews. It is distributed using the CoNLL-U format, pre-processed using UDPipe, along with a rich set of metadata. The work reported in this paper forms part of the SANT initiative (Sentiment Analysis for Norwegian Text), a project seeking to provide resources and tools for sentiment analysis and opinion mining for Norwegian. As resources for sentiment analysis have so far been unavailable for Norwegian, NoReC represents a highly valuable and sought-after addition to Norwegian language technology.","authors":["Erik Velldal","Lilja Ã˜vrelid","Eivind Alexander Bergem","Cathrine Stadsnes"],"meta":["October 2017"],"references":["318739283_Tokenizing_POS_Tagging_Lemmatizing_and_Parsing_UD_20_with_UDPipe","318739077_CoNLL_2017_Shared_Task_Multilingual_Parsing_from_Raw_Text_to_Universal_Dependencies","262370471_Langidpy_An_off-the-shelf_language_identification_tool","220873867_Learning_Word_Vectors_for_Sentiment_Analysis","306262937_UDPipe_Trainable_Pipeline_for_Processing_CoNLL-U_Files_Performing_Tokenization_Morphological_Analysis_POS_Tagging_and_Parsing","221653225_Latent_Aspect_Rating_Analysis_on_Review_Text_Data_A_Rating_Regression_Approach","220874207_Biographies_Bollywood_Boom-boxes_and_Blenders_Domain_Adaptation_for_Sentiment_Classification"]}
