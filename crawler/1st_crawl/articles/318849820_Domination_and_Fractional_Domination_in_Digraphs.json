{"id":"318849820_Domination_and_Fractional_Domination_in_Digraphs","abstract":"In this paper, we investigate the relation between the (fractional) domination number of a digraph $G$ and the independence number of its underlying graph, denoted by $\\alpha(G)$. More precisely, we prove that every digraph $G$ has fractional domination number at most $2\\alpha(G)$, and every directed triangle-free digraph $G$ has domination number at most $\\alpha(G)\\cdot \\alpha(G)!$. The first bound is sharp.","authors":["Ararat Harutyunyan","Tien-Nam Le","Alantha Newman","Stéphan Thomassé"],"meta":["August 2017The Electronic Journal of Combinatorics 25(3)","DOI:10.37236/7211"],"references":["313395168_Coloring_tournaments_From_local_to_global","316451346_Coloring_dense_digraphs","315570270_A_proof_of_the_ErdHos-Sands-Sauer-Woodrow_conjecture","244462698_Graph_Colouring_and_the_Probabilistic_Method","242619830_Fundamentals_of_Domination_in_Graphs","238884071_Squaring_a_Tournament_A_Proof_of_Dean's_Conjecture","235645414_Domination_in_transitive_colorings_of_tournaments","228976766_The_domination_number_of_a_tournament","222575665_Dominating_sets_in_k-majority_tournaments","222470154_On_finding_a_minimum_dominating_set_in_a_tournament"]}
