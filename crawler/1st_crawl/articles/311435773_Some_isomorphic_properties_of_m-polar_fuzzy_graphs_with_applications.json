{"id":"311435773_Some_isomorphic_properties_of_m-polar_fuzzy_graphs_with_applications","abstract":"The theory of graphs are very useful tool in solving the combinatorial problems in different areas of computer science and computational intelligence systems. In this paper, we present a frame work to handle m-polar fuzzy information by combining the theory of m-polar fuzzy sets with graphs. We introduce the notion of weak self complement m-polar fuzzy graphs and establish a necessary condition for m-polar fuzzy graph to be weak self complement. Some properties of self complement and weak self complement m-polar fuzzy graphs are discussed. The order, size, busy vertices and free vertices of an m-polar fuzzy graphs are also defined and proved that isomorphic m-polar fuzzy graphs have same order, size and degree. Also, we have presented some\nresults of busy vertices in isomorphic and weak isomorphic m-polar fuzzy graphs. Finally, a relative study of complement and operations on m-polar fuzzy graphs have been made. Applications of m-polar fuzzy graph are also given at the end.","authors":["Ganesh Ghorai","Madhumangal Pal"],"meta":["November 2016SpringerPlus 5(1)","DOI:10.1186/s40064-016-3783-z"],"references":["314375949_Complete_fuzzy_graphs","307528867_On_m-polar_fuzzy_graph_structures","304526053_Faces_and_dual_of_m-polar_fuzzy_planar_graphs","304525757_Some_properties_of_m-polar_fuzzy_graphs","301851029_Irregular_Bipolar_Fuzzy_Graphs","295908728_A_study_on_m-polar_fuzzy_planar_graphs","292143739_Product_of_bipolar_fuzzy_graphs_and_their_degree","288699916_Certain_types_of_irregular_m-polar_fuzzy_graphs","285264036_Fuzzy_Graphs_Fuzzy_Sets_and_their_Applications","283157319_Bipolar_fuzzy_graphs"]}
