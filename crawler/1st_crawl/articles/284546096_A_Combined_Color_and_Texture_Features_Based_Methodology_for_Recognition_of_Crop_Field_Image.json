{"id":"284546096_A_Combined_Color_and_Texture_Features_Based_Methodology_for_Recognition_of_Crop_Field_Image","abstract":"This paper presents a methodology to recognize certain crop fields' images using texture, color and combination of both types of features. In this work, we have considered eight varieties of crop images, namely, Brinjal, Cotton, Groundnut, Paddy, Soyabean, Sugarcane and Sunflower. Texture features using GLCM and color features using HSV are deployed. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is used for recognition. Considering only as feature, classification accuracies of 63.75%, 66.25% and 84.375% are obtained using texture, color and their combination respectively. The work is helpful in the area of agriculture for early detection and prevention of diseases.","authors":["Mrityunjaya V Latte","Sushila Shidnal","Basavaraj Anami","Vittal B Kuligod"],"meta":["February 2015","DOI:10.14257/ijsip.2015.8.2.28"],"references":["259558496_Plant_Recognition_Using_Stereo_Leaf_Image_Using_Gray-Level_Co-occurrence_Matrix","239731665_An_Overview_of_the_Research_on_Texture_Based_Plant_Leaf_Classification","224954034_Leaf_Classification_Using_Shape_Color_and_Texture_Features","284937265_A_spatial-spectral_feature_extraction_technique_for_color_images","271540623_Oil_palm_fresh_fruit_bunch_ripeness_classification_using_artificial_neural_network","257851168_Species_classification_of_aquatic_plants_using_PSVM_and_ANFIS","257334000_An_analysis_of_the_performance_of_Artificial_Neural_Network_technique_for_apple_classification","235949203_A_Leaf_Recognition_Technique_for_Plant_Classification_Using_RBPNN_and_Zernike_Moments","229355796_Mean-shift-based_color_segmentation_of_images_containing_green_vegetation","224578176_Image_retrieval_of_wood_species_by_color_texture_and_spatial_information"]}
