{"id":"349039186_Time-indexed_formulations_for_the_Order_Acceptance_Scheduling_problem_under_energy_aspects","abstract":"To comply with the new challenges of sustainability, the industrial sector is revising its means of supply and production. This entails, for instance, optimizing energy consumption and costs at the operational level. In this vein, this research presents an Order Acceptance Scheduling problem (OAS) on a single machine under electricity time-of-use tariffs and taxed carbon emission periods. The objective is to maximize the total profit. This problem arises when a company decides to select and process a subset of orders only if it is possible within a predetermined time-window. Therefore, the number of possible schedules grow at a factorial rate. To tackle this NP-hard problem, two time-indexed formulations are provided. Finally, to assess the performance of the proposed models, a comparative analysis against a classical formulation is conducted.","authors":["Mariam Bouzid","Oussama Masmoudi","Alice Yalaoui"],"meta":["November 2020","Conference: MOSIM'20At: Universit√© Internationale d'Agadir, Maroc","Project: Scheduling with energy aspects"],"references":["336175208_Order_Acceptance_and_Scheduling_Problem_with_Carbon_Emission_Reduction_and_Electricity_Tariffs_on_a_Single_Machine","333055965_The_impact_of_various_carbon_reduction_policies_on_green_flowshop_scheduling","332663400_Job-shop_scheduling_problem_with_energy_consideration","331624983_Order_acceptance_and_scheduling_overview_and_complexity_results","323137537_Multi-objective_optimization_of_single_machine_scheduling_with_energy_consumption_constraints","321930715_Production_scheduling_optimisation_with_machine_state_and_time-dependent_energy_costs","319568798_Exact_and_heuristic_algorithms_for_order_acceptance_and_scheduling_with_sequence-dependent_setup_times","315960301_Energy-conscious_unrelated_parallel_machine_scheduling_under_time-of-use_electricity_tariffs","261406201_Energy-conscious_flow_shop_scheduling_under_time-of-use_electricity_tariffs","257516273_Flow_shop_scheduling_with_peak_power_consumption_constraints"]}
