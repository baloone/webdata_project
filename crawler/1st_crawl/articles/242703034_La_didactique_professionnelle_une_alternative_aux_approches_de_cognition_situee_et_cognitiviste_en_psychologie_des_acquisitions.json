The paper aims at presenting professional didactics as a theoretical fra- mework which enables a) to take into account the various components of professional competence (work process knowledge, schemes of action, « quality » of perception and motor action, concerning the whole world of action: objects, tools, social organisation and self); b) to analyse the multi- fold determinants in the development of competences, including those emphasised by the situated cognition tenants and c) to discuss the design of training situations. The evolution of situated cognition is briefly recal- led, from the « strong form » as a reaction to strict cognitivism to the pre- sent « weak form(s) ». Cognitive psychology is presented in a counter- point, as departing from the initial « strong model » of human cognition as a system of information processing to proposals articulating cognition, perception, action and emotion. Situated learning is then discussed from the initial case of « everyday » mathematics in relation with the evolutions","authors":["Janine Rogalski"],"meta":["October 2004Activites 1(2)","DOI:10.4000/activites.1259"],"references":["348862010_Work_Process_Knowledge","324410307_Les_regles_du_jeu_L'action_collective_et_la_regulation_sociale","324321685_The_Psychology_of_Literacy","324308514_Plans_and_Situated_Actions_The_Problem_of_Human-Machine_Communication","318900741_Cognition_in_the_Head_and_in_the_World_An_Introduction_to_the_Special_Issue_on_Situated_Action","317953505_Situated_learning_Legitimate_peripheral_participation","313429525_La_theorie_des_champs_conceptuels","303019680_La_conceptualisation_dans_l'action_Bilan_et_nouvelles_perspectives","301634124_Situated_Cognition_Stepping_out_of_Representational_Flatland_A_Response_to_Swann's_Commentary","299534600_Developmental_studies_of_work_as_a_testbench_of_activity_theory_The_case_of_primary_care_medical_practice"]}
