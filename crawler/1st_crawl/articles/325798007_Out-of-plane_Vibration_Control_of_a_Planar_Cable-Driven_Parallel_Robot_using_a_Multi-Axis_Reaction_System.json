{"id":"325798007_Out-of-plane_Vibration_Control_of_a_Planar_Cable-Driven_Parallel_Robot_using_a_Multi-Axis_Reaction_System","abstract":"A robust MIMO sliding mode control strategy is proposed for out-of-plane stabilization of the end-effector of a planar cable-driven parallel robot using an underactuated multibody multi-axis reaction system governed by nonlinear equations of motion. Low manipulator stiffnesses in the non-planar directions is one of the concerns regarding accurate positioning of the end-effector for planar cable-driven robots, since the out-of-plane directions are uncontrollable via cable actuation. Therefore, an additional inertia based reaction system is added to the end-effector, consisting of two mirrored pendulum actuator systems, in order to elevate the system to a level of full controllability. A 5-dimensional multibody model of the end-effector with added multi-axis reaction system is presented and its equations of motion are derived. Sliding mode control is a robust nonlinear control approach that is capable of handling disturbances and parameter uncertainties. The sliding surfaces, one per actuated degree of freedom, are defined as a linear combination of the tracking position and velocity errors of both actuated and unactuated coordinates. The proposed sliding mode control law for the multi-axis reaction system has shown to perform well in both simulation and experiments.","authors":["Rogier de Rijk","Mitchell Rushton","Amir Khajepour"],"meta":["June 2018IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TMECH.2018.2847708"],"references":["311620165_Kinematically-Constrained_Redundant_Cable-Driven_Parallel_Robots_Modeling_Redundancy_Analysis_and_Stiffness_Optimization","270722458_An_Overview_of_the_Development_for_Cable-Driven_Parallel_Manipulator","253190017_The_Five-Hundred-Meter_Aperture_Spherical_Radio_Telescope_fast_Project","245322287_Sliding_mode_control_of_underactuated_multibody_systems_and_its_application_to_shape_change_control","225535741_Diao_XM_Vibration_Analysis_of_Cable-Driven_Parallel_Manipulators_Multibody_System_Dynamics_21_347-360","4119163_Sliding_control_approach_to_underactuated_multibody_systems","318274210_Transverse_Vibration_Control_in_Planar_Cable-Driven_Robotic_Manipulators","315012898_Analysis_of_a_High_Stiffness_Warehousing_Cable-Based_Robot","305907551_Optimal_actuator_placement_for_vibration_control_of_a_planar_cable-driven_robotic_manipulator","303081804_Study_on_multiple_degree-of-freedom_positioning_mechanism_using_wires_part_1_-_Concept_design_and_control","295595522_Y_Shtessel_C_Edwards_L_Fridman_A_Levant_Sliding_Mode_Control_and_Observation_Series_Control_Engineering_BirkhauserBasel_2014_ISBN_978-0-81764-8923","267489119_Design_and_Application_of_Chattering-Free_Sliding_Mode_Controller_to_Cable-Driven_Parallel_Robot_Manipulator_Theory_and_Experiment","260008872_Robust_PID_control_of_fully-constrained_cable_driven_parallel_robots","251866740_Constrained_model_predictive_control_of_the_redundant_cable_robots","3655539_Development_of_an_ultrahigh_speed_robot_FALCON_using_wire_drive_system","3024309_Normal_form_for_underactuated_mechanical_systems_with_symmetry","2745146_Underactuated_Mechanical_Systems"]}
