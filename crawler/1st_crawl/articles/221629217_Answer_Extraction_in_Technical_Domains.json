{"id":"221629217_Answer_Extraction_in_Technical_Domains","abstract":"In recent years, the information overload caused by the new media has made the shortcomings of traditional Information Retrieval \nincreasingly evident. Practical needs of industry, government organizations and individual users alike push the research community\ntowards systems that can exactly pinpoint those parts of documents that contain the information requested, rather than return\na set of relevant documents. Answer Extraction (AE) systems aim to satisfy this need. In this article we discuss the problems\nfaced in AE and present one such system.","authors":["Fabio Rinaldi","Michael Hess","Diego Molla Aliod","Rolf Schwitter"],"meta":["February 2002","DOI:10.1007/3-540-45715-1_37","SourceDBLP","Conference: Computational Linguistics and Intelligent Text Processing, Third International Conference, CICLing 2002, Mexico City, Mexico, February 17-23, 2002, Proceedings"],"references":["278750573_Inkrementelle_minimale_logische_Formen_fur_die_Antwortextraktion","238595499_University_of_Sheffield_TREC8_QA_System","233573106_Empirical_Observation_of_Term_Variations_and_Principles_for_their_Description","231807195_Natural_Language_Question_Answering_The_View_from_Here","266316624_WordNet_An_electronic_lexical_database_Language_Speech_and_Communication_Cambridge_MA_The_MIT_Press","248953300_Web_Reinforced_Question_Answering","243783616_Natural_language_processing_within_a_slot_grammar_framework","234816750_Ontological_promiscuity","234787041_A_Very_Fast_Prototype_Retrieval_System_using_Statistical_Ranking","230876272_Lunar_Rocks_in_Natural_English_Explorations_in_Natural_Language_Question_Answering"]}
