{"id":"261615381_Augmented_historical_scale_model_for_museums_From_curation_to_multi-modal_promotion","abstract":"In this paper, we describe an interactive museum application dedicated to historical scale models. This comes from a joint work between multidisciplinary teams: industrial engineering researchers, historians, museum curators and interactive interface designer. We present here the result of the project, based on scientific methodology. Results include system architecture, hardware and software, some use cases and user evaluation figures. This paper also underlines some methodologies issues that illustrate future possibilities.","authors":["Benjamin Hervy","F.
