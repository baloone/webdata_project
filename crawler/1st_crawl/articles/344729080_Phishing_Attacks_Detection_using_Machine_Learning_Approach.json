{"id":"344729080_Phishing_Attacks_Detection_using_Machine_Learning_Approach","abstract":"Abstract:\nEvolving digital transformation has exacerbated cybersecurity threats globally. Digitization expands the doors wider to cybercriminals. Initially cyberthreats approach in the form of phishing to steal the confidential user credentials. Usually, Hackers will influence the users through phishing in order to gain access to the organizatlou's digital assets and networks. With security breaches, cybercriminals execute ransomware attack, get unauthorized access, and shut down systems and even demand a ransom for releasing the access. Anti-phishing software and techniques are circumvented by the phishers for dodging tactics. Though threat intelligence and behavioural analytics systems support organizations to spot the unusual traffic patterns, still the best practice to prevent phishing attacks is defended in depth. In this perspective, the proposed research work has developed a model to detect the phishing attacks using machine learning (ML) algorithms like random forest (RF) and decision tree (DT). A standard legitimate dataset of phishing attacks from Kaggle was aided for ML processing. To analyze the attributes of the dataset, the proposed model has used feature selection algorithms like principal component analysis (PCA). Finally, a maximum accuracy of 97% was achieved through the random forest algorithm.","authors":["Dhiman Sarma","Sohrab Hossain","Ishita Saha","Mohammad Nazmul Alam"],"meta":["October 2020","DOI:10.1109/ICSSIT48917.2020.9214225","Conference: 2020 Third International Conference on Smart Systems and Inventive Technology (ICSSIT)At: Tirunelveli, India, India"],"references":["343043898_Cyber_Intrusion_Detection_Using_Machine_Learning_Classification_Techniques","343043518_A_Rule-Based_Expert_System_to_Assess_Coronary_Artery_Disease_Under_Uncertainty","343042297_Crime_Prediction_Using_Spatio-Temporal_Data","342055859_A_Combined_Belief_Rule_based_Expert_System_to_Predict_Coronary_Artery_Disease","341165253_Replacing_Email_Protocols_with_Blockchain-based_Smart_Contracts","341154897_Feature_Selection_for_Phishing_Website_Classification","341130786_Intelligent_Phishing_Detection_Scheme_Algorithms_Using_Deep_Learning","340459877_Security_of_Hard_Disk_Encryption","340255264_DeNNeS_deep_embedded_neural_network_expert_system_for_detecting_cyber_attacks","340058714_A_Belief_Rule_Based_Expert_System_to_Predict_Student_Performance_under_Uncertainty","338504707_Phishing_web_site_detection_using_diverse_machine_learning_algorithms","337404515_Performance_evaluation_of_Botnet_DDoS_attack_detection_using_machine_learning","328201256_Twitter_spam_account_detection_based_on_clustering_and_classification_methods","323197556_Performance_analysis_of_a_surveillance_system_to_detect_and_track_vehicles_using_Haar_cascaded_classifiers_and_optical_flow_method","347665952_Protection_of_the_Rights_and_Freedoms_of_Minors_in_the_Digital_Space","341253069_LogoSENSE_A_Companion_HOG_based_Logo_Detection_Scheme_for_Phishing_Web_Page_and_E-mail_Brand_Recognition","341088619_Susceptibility_to_Phishing_on_Social_Network_Sites_A_Personality_Information_Processing_Model","341066906_Spam_detection_through_feature_selection_using_artificial_neural_network_and_sine-cosine_algorithm","340590641_Detecting_Internet_of_Things_attacks_using_distributed_deep_learning","340285153_A_Critical_Comparison_Between_Distributed_Database_Approach_and_Data_Warehousing_Approach","339897593_Smishing_Detector_A_security_model_to_detect_smishing_through_SMS_content_analysis_and_URL_behavior_analysis","339888372_Identifying_phishing_attacks_in_communication_networks_using_URL_consistency_features","339316883_Detection_of_illicit_accounts_over_the_Ethereum_blockchain","339023050_Malicious_URL_Detection_based_on_Machine_Learning","337640041_A_performance_analysis_of_Software_Defined_Network_based_prevention_on_phishing_attack_in_cyberspace_using_a_deep_machine_learning_with_CANTINA_approach_DMLCA","337430621_Countering_Malicious_URLs_in_Internet-of-Thing_IoT_using_a_knowledge-based_approach_and_simulated_expert","318647424_PhiDMA_-_A_Phishing_Detection_Model_with_Multi-filter_Approach"]}
