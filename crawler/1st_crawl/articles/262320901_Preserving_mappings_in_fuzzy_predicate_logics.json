{"id":"262320901_Preserving_mappings_in_fuzzy_predicate_logics","abstract":"In this article, we develop the method of diagrams for fuzzy predicate logics and give a characterization of different kinds\nof preserving mappings in terms of diagrams. Our work is a contribution to the model-theoretic study of fuzzy predicate logics.\nWe present a reduced semantics and we prove a completeness theorem of the logics with respect to this semantics. The main concepts being studied are the\nLeibniz congruence and the structure-preserving relation. On the one hand, the Leibniz congruence of a model identifies the elements that are indistinguishable using equality-free\natomic formulas and parameters from the model. A reduced structure is the quotient of a model modulo this congruence. On the\nother hand, the structure-preserving relation between two structures plays the same role that the isomorphism relation plays\nin classical predicate languages with equality.","authors":["Maria Pilar Dellunde"],"meta":["December 2012Journal of Logic and Computation 22(6):1367-1389","DOI:10.1093/logcom/exr019"],"references":["220297791_A_Proof_of_Standard_Completeness_for_Esteva_and_Godo's_Logic_MTL","228034975_Fuzzy_Models_of_First_Order_Languages","225226962_Protoalgebraic_logics","223593669_Zadeh_LA_Similarity_Relations_and_Fuzzy_Orderings_Information_Sciences_3_177-200","222658354_Distinguished_algebraic_semantics_for_-norm_based_fuzzy_logics_Methods_and_algebraic_equivalencies","222596274_Godo_L_Monoidal_t-norm_Based_Logic_Towards_a_Logic_for_Left-continuous_t-norms_Fuzzy_Sets_and_Systems_1243_271-288","222587326_Triangular_norm_based_predicate_fuzzy_logics","222491697_On_the_semantics_of_fuzzy_logic","38339006_On_theories_and_models_in_fuzzy_predicate_logic"]}
