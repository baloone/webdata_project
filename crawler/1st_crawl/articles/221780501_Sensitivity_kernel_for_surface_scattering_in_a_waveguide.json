{"id":"221780501_Sensitivity_kernel_for_surface_scattering_in_a_waveguide","abstract":"Using the Born approximation, a linearized sensitivity kernel is derived to describe the relationship between a local change at the free surface and its effect on the acoustic propagation in the water column. The structure of the surface scattering kernel is investigated numerically and experimentally for the case of a waveguide at the ultrasonic scale. To better demonstrate the sensitivity of the multipath propagation to the introduction of a localized perturbation at the air-water interface, the kernel is formulated both in terms of point-to-point and beam-to-beam representations. Agreement between theory and experiment suggests applications to sensitivity analysis of the wavefield for sea surface perturbations.","authors":["Jit Sarkar","Christian Marandet","Philippe Roux","Shane Walker"],"meta":["January 2012The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America 131(1):111-8","DOI:10.1121/1.3665999","SourcePubMed"],"references":["281697336_Shallow_water_tomography_Ray_theory_vs_travel-time_sensitivity_kernels","266235755_Attenuation_of_the_coherent_component_of_sound_propagating_in_shallow_water_with_rough_boundaries","252968273_Self-consistent_perturbation_approach_to_rough_surface_scattering_in_stratified_media","243776990_The_Validity_of_the_Kirchoff_Approximation_for_Rough_Surface_Scattering_Using_a_Gaussian_Roughness_Spectrum","243526208_Travel-time_sensitivity_kernels_in_ocean_acoustic_tomography","243525451_Turning_point_filters_Analysis_of_sound_propagation_on_a_gyre-scale","243514717_Scintillation_index_of_the_acoustic_field_forward_scattered_by_a_rough_surface_for_two-_and_three-dimensional_scattering_geometries","243511990_The_validity_of_the_perturbation_approximation_for_rough_surface_scattering_using_a_Gaussian_roughness_spectrum","243350940_Inverse_scattering_for_stratified_elastic_media","238984550_On_the_Non-Specular_Reflection_of_Plane_Waves_of_Sound"]}
