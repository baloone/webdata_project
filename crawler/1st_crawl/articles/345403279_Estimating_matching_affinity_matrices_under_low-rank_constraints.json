{"id":"345403279_Estimating_matching_affinity_matrices_under_low-rank_constraints","abstract":"In this paper, we address the problem of estimating transport surplus (a.k.a. matching affinity) in high-dimensional optimal transport problems. Classical optimal transport theory specifies the matching affinity and determines the optimal joint distribution. In contrast, we study the inverse problem of estimating matching affinity based on the observation of the joint distribution, using an entropic regularization of the problem. To accommodate high dimensionality of the data, we propose a novel method that incorporates a nuclear norm regularization that effectively enforces a rank constraint on the affinity matrix. The low-rank matrix estimated in this way reveals the main factors that are relevant for matching.","authors":["Arnaud Dupuy","Alfred Galichon","Yifei Sun"],"meta":["December 2019Information and Inference A Journal of the IMA 8(4):677-689","DOI:10.1093/imaiai/iaz015"],"references":["269722049_Iterative_Bregman_Projections_for_Regularized_Transportation_Problems","259712103_Fatter_Attraction_Anthropometric_and_Socioeconomic_Matching_on_the_Marriage_Market","238879850_Central_Limit_Theorems_for_the_Wasserstein_Distance_Between_the_Empirical_and_the_True_Distributions","236736746_An_Accelerated_Proximal_Gradient_Algorithm_for_Nuclear_Norm_Regularized_Least_Squares_Problems","24103785_Effects_of_Family_Background_on_Earnings_and_Returns_to_Schooling_Evidence_from_Brazil","24056742_The_Nonatomic_Assignment_Model","1896344_Guaranteed_Minimum-Rank_Solutions_of_Linear_Matrix_Equations_via_Nuclear_Norm_Minimization","345663409_Optimal_Transport_Methods_in_Economics","314545248_Optimal_Transport_Methods_in_Economics","312488629_A_Theory_of_Marriage_Part_I","280707299_Identification_in_matching_games","266415110_Optimal_transportation_and_applications_Lectures_given_at_the_C_I_M_E_summer_school_Martina_Franca_Italy_September_2-8_2001","263082606_Canonical_Correlation_and_Assortative_Matching_A_Remark","260870869_Personality_Traits_and_the_Marriage_Market","256037894_Canonical_Correlation_and_Assortative_Matching_A_Remark","255856825_of_LaborPersonality_Traits_and_the_Marriage_Market","239328511_A_Direct_Test_of_the_Elucient_Marriage_Market_Hypothesis","239230352_Topics_in_Optimal_Transportation_Theory","237053780_Sinkhorn_Distances_Lightspeed_Computation_of_Optimal_Transportation_Distances","228269574_Cupid's_Invisible_Hand_Social_Surplus_and_Identification_in_Matching_Models","226285160_The_assignment_game_I_The_core","223668625_Marriage_and_the_City_Search_Frictions_and_Sorting_of_Singles","222644026_Characterization_of_the_subdifferential_of_some_matrix_norms","222505461_Subjective_Measures_of_Household_Preferences_and_Financial_Decisions","220693673_Assignment_Problems","46552803_Family_Ties_and_Labor_Markets_in_the_United_States_and_Brazil","37598590_Studies_of_talent_markets","24107411_A_theory_of_marriage_part_I_J_Polit_Econ","24104443_Who_Marries_Whom_and_Why","5211226_A_Direct_Test_of_the_Efficient_Marriage_Market_Hypothesis","5156809_The_Relationship_Between_Wife's_Education_and_Husband's_Earnings_Evidence_from_1960_to_2000","5073926_Effects_on_Family_Background_on_Earnings_and_Returns_to_Schooling_Evidence_from_Brazil"]}
