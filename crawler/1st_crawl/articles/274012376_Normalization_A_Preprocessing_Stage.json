{"id":"274012376_Normalization_A_Preprocessing_Stage","abstract":"As we know that the normalization is a pre-processing stage of any type\nproblem statement. Especially normalization takes important role in the field\nof soft computing, cloud computing etc. for manipulation of data like scale\ndown or scale up the range of data before it becomes used for further stage.\nThere are so many normalization techniques are there namely Min-Max\nnormalization, Z-score normalization and Decimal scaling normalization. So by\nreferring these normalization techniques we are going to propose one new\nnormalization technique namely, Integer Scaling Normalization. And we are going\nto show our proposed normalization technique using various data sets.","authors":["S GOPAL KRISHNA PATRO","Dr-Kishore Kumar Sahu"],"meta":["March 2015IARJSET","DOI:10.17148/IARJSET.2015.2305","SourcearXiv"],"references":["273632751_A_Multi-Objective_Task_Scheduling_Algorithm_for_Heterogeneous_Multi-cloud_Environment","273472171_Technical_Analysis_on_Financial_Forecasting","26445674_Data_Mining_A_Preprocessing_Engine","274739248_Efficient_task_scheduling_algorithms_for_heterogeneous_multi-cloud_environment","273632744_A_Smoothing_Based_Task_Scheduling_Algorithm_for_Heterogeneous_Multi-Cloud_Environment","273632677_An_Efficient_Task_Scheduling_Algorithm_for_Heterogeneous_Multi-cloud_Environment"]}
