{"id":"225144510_A_Logical_Calculus_of_the_Idea_Immanent_in_Nervous_Activity","abstract":"Because of the “all-or-none” character of nervous activity, neural events and the relations among them can be treated by means\nof propositional logic. It is found that the behavior of every net can be described in these terms, with the addition of more\ncomplicated logical means for nets containing circles; and that for any logical expression satisfying certain conditions,\none can find a net behaving in the fashion it describes. It is shown that many particular choices among possible neurophysiological\nassumptions are equivalent, in the sense that for every net behaving under one assumption, there exists another net which\nbehaves under the other and gives the same results, although perhaps not in the same time. Various applications of the calculus\nare discussed.","authors":["Warren S.
