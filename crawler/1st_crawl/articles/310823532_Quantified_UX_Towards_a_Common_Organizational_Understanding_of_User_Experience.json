{"id":"310823532_Quantified_UX_Towards_a_Common_Organizational_Understanding_of_User_Experience","abstract":"User Experience (UX) is increasingly being recognized as an important factor for the commercial success of digital products. In fact, it has become a buzzword, which is interpreted differently by different parties. This lack of common understanding inevitably leads to misunderstandings and inefficiency in industrial practice. We therefore propose a quantifiable way of describing User Experience (QUX). Based on the analysis of 84 UX evaluation methods, a sample of UX characteristics from literature, and 24 interviews with experts from academia and practice, we propose a formalism and a corresponding tool to measure, visualize, and communicate a product's UX within organizations. We showcase the benefits of our approach by integrating it into the product development processes of companies from three different industries.","authors":["Florian Lachner","Philipp Naegelein","Robert Kowalski","Martin Spann"],"meta":["October 2016","DOI:10.1145/2971485.2971501","Conference: the 9th Nordic Conference","Project: UX Evaluation Methods in Academic and Industrial Contexts"],"references":["313757692_Measuring_emotion_Development_and_application_of_an_instrument_to_Measure_Emotional_Responses_to_Products","313752737_Marketing_Scales_Handbook_-_Vol_9_sample","342183905_A_Coefficient_of_Agreement_for_Nominal_Scales","325001718_Evolving_Interpretations_as_a_Change_Unfolds_How_Managers_Construe_Key_Organizational_Events","301389722_ambiPad","300725403_Emotional_Interaction_and_Nofitication_of_Flexible_Handheld_Devices","291025310_Welcome_to_the_experience_economy","289741322_My_data_store_Toward_user_awareness_and_control_on_personal_data","289311430_MobileMiner_Mining_your_frequent_patterns_on_your_phone","281719294_Measuring_User_Rated_Language_Quality_Development_and_Validation_of_the_User_Interface_Language_Quality_Survey_LQS"]}
