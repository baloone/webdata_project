{"id":"344750038_Assessing_the_Current_Level_of_the_Computational_Thinking_Within_the_Primary_and_Lower_Secondary_School_Students_using_Educational_Robotics_Tasks","abstract":"The aim of this research was to develop a set of tasks assessing prerequisite Computational Thinking (CT) skills within Czech primary school students using an educational robotics as a supporting tool. Czech Republic, along with numerous European countries, currently implements a revision of the existing computer science curriculum at the primary and secondary education level, to widen the national information literacy and embed the development of CT into the basic STEM education. The integration of the CT development at a level of a national school education raises a question of assessing actual CT skills of the students and creating a standardized methodology for a such assessment. This paper discusses the results of the research aimed to assess the CT skills within primary school students which was tested on a sample number of 90 students age 8 - 13 during extended education classes and events.","authors":["Lucie Bryndová","Petri Mališů"],"meta":["July 2020","DOI:10.1145/3416797.3416819","Project: Possibilities of measuring computational thinking levels of pupils in primary schools"],"references":["326307149_TRADITIONAL_TOPICS_FOR_THE_FRAMEWORK_EDUCATIONAL_PROGRAMME_FOCUSED_ON_ICT_AREA_AND_THE_PERCEPTION_OF_THESE_TOPICS_BY_THE_PRIMARY_SCHOOL_NINTH_GRADE_PUPILS","322993437_THE_NORDIC_APPROACH_TO_INTRODUCING_COMPUTATIONAL_THINKING_AND_PROGRAMMING_IN_COMPULSORY_EDUCATION","305140678_A_K-6_Computational_Thinking_Curriculum_Framework_Implications_for_Teacher_Knowledge","274309848_Computational_Thinking","338450598_Assessing_computational_thinking_A_systematic_review_of_empirical_studies","323694136_EDUKACNI_ROBOTIKA_VE_VYUCE_NA_ZAKLADNICH_SKOLACH_V_CESKE_REPUBLICE","322595635_Computational_Thinking_Equity_in_Elementary_Classrooms_What_Third-Grade_Students_Know_and_Can_Do","308654282_Which_cognitive_abilities_underlie_computational_thinking_Criterion_validity_of_the_Computational_Thinking_Test"]}
