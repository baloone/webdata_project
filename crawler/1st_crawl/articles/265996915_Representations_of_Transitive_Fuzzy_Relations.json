{"id":"265996915_Representations_of_Transitive_Fuzzy_Relations","abstract":"Since Zadeh (1971) introduced similarity relations and fuzzy orderings, a great deal of work has been done in studying properties of these relations and their applications. The reader is referred to recent volumes edited by Gupta and Sanchez (1982), Yager (1982), and Gupta, Ragade and Yager (1979) for a representative sample of publications in this area.","authors":["S.V.
