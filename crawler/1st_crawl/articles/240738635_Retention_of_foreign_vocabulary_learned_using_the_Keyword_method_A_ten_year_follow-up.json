{"id":"240738635_Retention_of_foreign_vocabulary_learned_using_the_Keyword_method_A_ten_year_follow-up","abstract":"This article assesses one individual's level of recall for foreign vocabulary learned ten years previously using the keyword method. Without any revision at all, he remembered 35% of the test words with spelling fully correct and over 50% with only very minor errors of spelling. After 10 minutes spent looking at a vocabulary list, recall increased to 65% and 76% respectively. After a period of revision lasting a further 1Â½ hours, recall was virtually 100%. This level of recall was maintained for at least one month. The results indicate 1) that the keyword method (as incorporated in Linkword courses) may be used to learn a large list of vocabulary; and 2) this method of learning is not inimical to retention in the long term. Some theoretical aspects of the findings are discussed.","authors":["A. A. Beaton","M. M. Gruneberg","Nick C.
