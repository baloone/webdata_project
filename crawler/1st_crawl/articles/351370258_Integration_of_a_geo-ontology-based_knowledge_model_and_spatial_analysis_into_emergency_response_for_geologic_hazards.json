{"id":"351370258_Integration_of_a_geo-ontology-based_knowledge_model_and_spatial_analysis_into_emergency_response_for_geologic_hazards","abstract":"Emergency response is an important task in geologic hazard emergency management in China. Rapid emergency response actions can effectively reduce the losses caused by geologic hazards. Emergency plans and emergency command systems play an important role in emergency response. The emergency response still comes with challenges, such as the difficulty of integrating emergency plans with real-time geologic hazard information and the operability of emergency disposal in emergency plans. One possible approach to solving this problem is to model and represent knowledge and to enable the emergency command system to acquire and intelligently provide the required emergency response knowledge. In this paper, we propose a conceptual model of knowledge for geologic hazard emergency response (GHER). The geospatial characteristics of GHER knowledge are represented by the geo-ontology in the modeling process. The ontology enables semantic interoperability of GHER knowledge. A case study is used as an application test to evaluate the framework of GHER knowledge acquisition. In the framework, the GHER knowledge model enables the emergency command system to provide imperative knowledge intelligently for emergency decision-making; knowledge inference enables the emergency command system to provide important implicit knowledge for emergency response; and spatial analysis of geographic information system is applied to visualize and analyze spatial data in the process of emergency response.","authors":["Xiaohui Liu","Zhen Liu","Yongwei Liu","Jiakuan Tian"],"meta":["September 2021Natural Hazards 108(4):1-26","DOI:10.1007/s11069-021-04742-5"],"references":["318410048_A_geo-ontology-based_approach_to_decision-making_in_emergency_management_of_meteorological_disasters","285575531_A_Map-Reduce_based_parallel_approach_for_improving_query_performance_in_a_geospatial_semantic_web_for_disaster_response","261844253_Modeling_and_representation_for_earthquake_emergency_response_knowledge_Perspective_for_working_with_geo-ontology","257737877_Research_on_Development_of_Agricultural_Geographic_Information_Ontology","328506300_What_Kind_of_Ontological_Categories_for_Geo-ontologies","319770379_Formal_Modelling_and_Comparing_of_Disaster_Plans","309523371_A_bibliometric_and_visual_analysis_of_global_geo-ontology_research","296516800_Formal_representation_of_spatial_properties_of_geographic_ontology","290900921_Research_on_ontology-based_emergency_response_plan_template","257371727_An_integrated_approach_to_intelligent_urban_facilities_management_for_real-time_emergency_response","228927848_An_event-based_task_framework_for_disaster_planning_and_decision_support","226919372_Mapping_between_dynamic_ontologies_in_support_of_geospatial_data_integration_for_disaster_management","257055058_An_ontology-enabled_framework_for_a_geospatial_problem-solving_environment","254237965_Multi-criteria_modelling_and_clustering_of_spatial_information","222637585_A_critical_evaluation_of_ontology_languages_for_geographic_information_retrieval_on_the_Internet"]}
