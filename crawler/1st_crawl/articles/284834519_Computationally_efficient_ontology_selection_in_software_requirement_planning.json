{"id":"284834519_Computationally_efficient_ontology_selection_in_software_requirement_planning","abstract":"Understanding the needs of stakeholders and prioritizing requirements are the vital steps in the development of any software application. Enabling tools to support these steps have a critical role in the success of the corresponding software application. Based on such a critical role, this paper presents a computationally efficient ontology selection in software requirement planning. The key point guiding the underlying design is that, once gathered, requirements need to be processed by decomposition towards the generation of a specified systems design. A representational framework allows for the expression of high level abstract conceptions under a single schema, which may then be made explicit in terms of axiomatic relations and expressed in a suitable ontology. The initial experimental results indicate that our framework for filtered selection of a suitable ontology operates in a computationally efficient manner.","authors":["Robert B K Brown","Ghassan Beydoun","Graham Low","William Tibben"],"meta":["October 2014Information Systems Frontiers 18(2):1-10","DOI:10.1007/s10796-014-9540-3","Project: Evaluation of Knowledge Models"],"references":["302937543_Ontologies_Principles_methods_and_applications","277037018_Requirements_Engineering_and_the_Semantic_Web_Part_II_Representaion_Management_and_Validation_of_Requirements_and_System-Level_Architectures","271631225_Integration_of_business_process_modeling_and_Web_services_A_survey","262677609_Identification_of_Ontologies_to_support_information_Systems_development","261224462_MOVE_A_Large_Scale_Keyword-Based_Content_Filtering_and_Dissemination_System","257574599_Beast_methodology_An_agile_testing_methodology_for_multi-agent_systems_based_on_behaviour_driven_development","257371599_Applying_model-driven_engineering_to_the_development_of_Rich_Internet_Applications_for_Business_Intelligence","232648370_Semantic_Interoperability_of_Web_Services_-_Challenges_and_Experiences","228625623_Revisiting_Ontology-based_Requirements_Engineering_in_the_age_of_the_Semantic_Web","227105883_An_Ontology-Based_Approach_for_Supporting_Business-IT_Alignment","226926997_METEOR-S_WSDI_A_Scalable_P2P_Infrastructure_of_Registries_for_Semantic_Publication_and_Discovery_of_Web_Services","226279556_What_Is_an_Ontology","225196674_Design_of_a_Peer-to-Peer_Information_Sharing_MAS_Using_MOBMAS_Ontology-Centric_Agent_Oriented_Methodology","224256376_User-Centered_Design_and_Agile_Methods_A_Systematic_Review","224232442_Ontology-Based_Business_Process_Customization_for_Composite_Web_Services","222484351_Design_and_Natural_Science_Research_on_Information_Technology","222305044_Knowledge_engineering_principles_and_methods_Data_Knowl_Eng_251-2161-197","221466419_Sesame_A_Generic_Architecture_for_Storing_and_Querying_RDF_and_RDF_Schema","220543380_Semantic_Matchmaking_as_Non-Monotonic_Reasoning_A_Description_Logic_Approach","220426227_A_Framework_for_Identifying_Software_Project_Risks","47389571_Ontology-Based_Translation_of_Business_Process_Models","3679163_Towards_modeling_and_reasoning_support_for_early-phase_requirements_engineering","2746440_Simultaneous_Modelling_and_Knowledge_Acquisition_Using_NRDR","319395262_OWL_Web_Ontology_Language_Guide","313620522_Ontologies_Principles_methods_and_applications","312781451_What_Users_Do_SAD_with_the_ATSA_Method","312769249_A_Social-Creative-Cognitive_SCC_Model_for_Requirements_Engineering","290110321_Sesame_A_Generic_Architecture_for_Storing_and_Querying_RDF_and_RDF_Schema","284687973_The_business_end_of_IT_project_failure","271921563_An_ontological-based_knowledge-representation_formalism_for_case-based_argumentation","257896710_Enterprise_applications_of_semantic_technologies_for_business_process_management","257574561_Personalized_Web_Feeds_Based_on_Ontology_Technologies","257574486_Ontology-based_data_access_An_application_to_intermodal_logistics","257455304_Quantifying_the_impact_of_requirements_definition_and_management_process_maturity_on_project_outcome_in_large_business_application_development","257391637_Applying_an_ontology_approach_to_IT_service_management_for_business-IT_integration","257160622_Providing_metrics_and_automatic_enhancement_for_hierarchical_taxonomies","235265681_Business_process_management_BPM_standards_A_survey","224773145_Design_Patterns_Elements_of_Reusable_Object-Oriented_Software","221694456_Where_to_Publish_and_Find_Ontologies_A_Survey_of_Ontology_Libraries","221394578_Foundations_of_Ontology-Based_MAS_Methodologies","220208010_What_went_wrong_Unsuccessful_information_technology_projects","220130828_Goal-Directed_Requirements_Acquisition","220108202_Classical_mereology_and_restricted_domains","215863729_A_Semantic_Web_primer","200043358_Semantic_Web_for_the_Working_Ontologist","28804398_Collaborative_Tagging_as_a_Knowledge_Organisation_and_Resource_Discovery_Tool","3419528_Jena_A_Semantic_Web_Toolkit","2601385_Gruninger_M_Ontologies_Principles_methods_and_applications_Knowledge_Eng_Rev_112_93-155"]}
