{"id":"319174731_Comparison_of_PET_and_CT_radiomics_for_prediction_of_local_tumor_control_in_head_and_neck_squamous_cell_carcinoma","abstract":"Purpose: An association between radiomic features extracted from CT and local tumor control in the\nhead and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) has been shown. This study investigated the value\nof pretreatment functional imaging (18F-FDG PET) radiomics for modeling of local tumor control.\nMaterial and Methods: Data from HNSCC patients (n = 121) treated with definitive radiochemotherapy\nwere used for model training. In total, 569 radiomic features were extracted from both contrastenhanced\nCT and 18F-FDG PET images in the primary tumor region. CT, PET and combined PET/CT\nradiomic models to assess local tumor control were trained separately. Five feature selection and three\nclassification methods were implemented. The performance of the models was quantified using concordance\nindex (CI) in 5-fold cross validation in the training cohort. The best models, per image modality,\nwere compared and verified in the independent validation cohort (n = 51). The difference in CI was\ninvestigated using bootstrapping. Additionally, the observed and radiomics-based estimated probabilities\nof local tumor control were compared between two risk groups.\nResults: The feature selection using principal component analysis and the classification based on the\nmultivariabale Cox regression with backward selection of the variables resulted in the best models for\nall image modalities (CI_CT = 0.72, CI_PET = 0.74, CI_PET/CT = 0.77). Tumors more homogenous in CT density\n(decreased GLSZMsize_zone_entropy) and with a focused region of high FDG uptake (higher GLSZMSZLGE)\nindicated better prognosis. No significant difference in the performance of the models in the validation\ncohort was observed (CI_CT = 0.73, CI_PET = 0.71, CI_PET/CT = 0.73). However, the CT radiomics-based model\noverestimated the probability of tumor control in the poor prognostic group (predicted = 68%,\nobserved = 56%).\nConclusions: Both CT and PET radiomics showed equally good discriminative power for local tumor\ncontrol modeling in HNSCC. However, CT-based predictions overestimated the local control rate in the\npoor prognostic validation cohort, and thus, we recommend to base the local control modeling on the\n18F-FDG PET.","authors":["Marta Bogowicz","Oliver Riesterer","Luisa Sabrina Stark","Gabriela Studer"],"meta":["August 2017Acta oncologica (Stockholm, Sweden) 56(11)","DOI:10.1080/0284186X.2017.1346382"],"references":["315656699_Radiomics_strategies_for_risk_assessment_of_tumour_failure_in_head-and-neck_cancer","306435240_Trends_in_all-cause_five-year_mortality_after_head_and_neck_cancers_diagnosed_over_a_period_of_33_years_Focus_on_estimated_degree_of_association_with_human_papillomavirus","306008385_Radiomics_in_head_and_neck_cancer_From_exploration_to_application","303829534_Characterization_of_PETCT_images_using_texture_analysis_the_past_the_present_any_future","280998421_External_validation_of_a_prognostic_CT-based_radiomic_signature_in_oropharyngeal_squamous_cell_carcinoma","279246275_Radiomic_feature_clusters_and_Prognostic_Signatures_specific_for_Lung_and_Head_Neck_cancer","268882651_Impact_of_HPV-associated_p16-expression_on_radiotherapy_outcome_in_advanced_oropharynx_and_non-oropharynx_cancer","262817448_Decoding_tumour_phenotype_by_noninvasive_imaging_using_a_quantitative_radiomics_approach","256762977_Stability_of_FDG-PET_Radiomics_features_An_integrated_analysis_of_test-retest_and_inter-observer_variability","236039023_FDG-PETCT_imaging_biomarkers_in_head_and_neck_squamous_cell_carcinoma","221759548_Radiomics_Extracting_more_information_from_medical_images_using_advanced_feature_analysis","44656063_Human_Papillomavirus_and_Survival_of_Patients_with_Oropharyngeal_Cancer","7889340_The_prognostic_value_of_the_hypoxia_markers_CA_IX_and_GLUT_I_and_the_cytokines_VEGF_and_IL_6_in_head_and_neck_squamous_cell_carcinoma_treated_by_radiotherapy_chemotherapy","317619777_CT_radiomics_predicts_HPV_status_and_local_tumor_control_after_definitive_radiochemotherapy_in_head_and_neck_squamous_cell_carcinoma","303869113_Applications_and_limitations_of_radiomics","302910644_Validation_of_a_15-gene_hypoxia_classifier_in_head_and_neck_cancer_for_prospective_use_in_clinical_trials","292077400_Texture_analysis_on_parametric_maps_derived_from_dynamic_contrast-enhanced_magnetic_resonance_imaging_in_head_and_neck_cancer","282732195_Tumor_stage_tumor_site_and_HPV_dependent_correlation_of_perfusion_CT_parameters_and_18F-FDG_uptake_in_head_and_neck_squamous_cell_carcinoma","271591425_Locally_advanced_head_and_neck_cancer_treated_with_accelerated_radiotherapy_the_hypoxic_modifier_nimorazole_and_weekly_cisplatin_Results_from_the_DAHANCA_18_phase_II_study","268787374_Emerging_biomarkers_in_head_and_neck_cancer_in_the_era_of_genomics","51155005_Dynamic_Contrast-Enhanced_Magnetic_Resonance_Imaging_as_a_Predictor_of_Outcome_in_Head-and-Neck_Squamous_Cell_Carcinoma_Patients_With_Nodal_Metastases","6337671_Jensen_AR_Nellemann_HM_Overgaard_JTumor_progression_in_waiting_time_for_radiotherapy_in_head_and_neck_cancer_Radiother_Oncol_84_5-10","6013964_Use_of_Molecular_Biomarkers_for_Predicting_the_Response_to_Radiotherapy_With_or_Without_Chemotherapy"]}
