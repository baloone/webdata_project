{"id":"288991542_A_Deep_Learning_Approach_for_Network_Intrusion_Detection_System","abstract":"A Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) helps system administrators to detect network security breaches in\n\ntheir organizations. However, many challenges arise while\n\ndeveloping a flexible and efficient NIDS for unforeseen and unpredictable attacks. We propose a deep learning based approach for developing such an efficient and flexible NIDS.\n\nWe use Self-taught Learning (STL), a deep learning based technique, on NSL-KDD - a benchmark dataset for network\n\nintrusion. We present the performance of our approach and compare it with a few previous work. Compared metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and f-measure values.","authors":["Ahmad Yazdan Javaid","Quamar Niyaz","Weiqing Sun","Mansoor Alam"],"meta":["December 2015Security and Safety 3(9)","DOI:10.4108/eai.3-12-2015.2262516","Conference: 9th EAI International Conference on Bio-inspired Information and Communications TechnologiesAt: New York","Project: NIDS Development for an SDN environment"],"references":[]}
