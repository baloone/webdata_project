{"id":"320274031_Counterfactual_Causality_from_First_Principles","abstract":"In this position paper we discuss three main shortcomings of existing approaches to counterfactual causality from the computer science perspective, and sketch lines of work to try and overcome these issues: (1) causality definitions should be driven by a set of precisely specified requirements rather than specific examples; (2) causality frameworks should support system dynamics; (3) causality analysis should have a well-understood behavior in presence of abstraction.","authors":["Gregor GÃ¶ssler","Oleg Sokolsky","Jean-Bernard Stefani"],"meta":["October 2017","DOI:10.4204/EPTCS.259.5"],"references":["305993734_A_general_framework_for_defining_and_extending_actual_causation_using_CP-logic","325768457_Introduction_to_coalgebra_Towards_mathematics_of_states_and_observation","314638800_Fault_Ascription_in_Concurrent_Systems","308392858_Hybrid_Automata_as_Coalgebras","303820714_Program_Actions_as_Actual_Causes_A_Building_Block_for_Accountability","288802473_Graphs_rewriting_and_pathway_reconstruction_for_rule-based_models","286227274_Blaming_in_component-based_real-time_systems","284846499_Symbolic_Causality_Checking_Using_Bounded_Model_Checking","279974434_Causation","279754815_A_general_framework_for_blaming_in_component-based_systems"]}
