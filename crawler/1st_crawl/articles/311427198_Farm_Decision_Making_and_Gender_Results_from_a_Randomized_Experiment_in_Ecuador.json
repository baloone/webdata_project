{"id":"311427198_Farm_Decision_Making_and_Gender_Results_from_a_Randomized_Experiment_in_Ecuador","abstract":"Substantial resources have been devoted to mitigating the asset gender gap in developing country agriculture. Efforts have been taken to understand the role of women in decision making and in farm operations. Recommendations for best practices in eliciting information on women’s roles have emphasized the importance of sex-disaggregated data collection and analysis. Collection of sex-disaggregated data is not straightforward and careful attention to context is needed. In Ecuador’s highlands, chemical use in agriculture is widespread, and outreach and training programs to reduce this use are essential. These programs should target the appropriate decision makers.","authors":["Jeffrey Alwang","Catherine Larochelle","Victor Barrera"],"meta":["April 2017World Development 92:117-129","DOI:10.1016/j.worlddev.2016.11.015"],"references":["312457786_Women_rule_Potato_markets_and_access_to_information_in_the_Bolivian_highlands","298793146_Gender_assets_and_agricultural_development_Lessons_from_eight_projects_OPEN_ACCESS","283976699_Does_IPM_Have_Staying_Power_Revisiting_a_Potato-producing_Area_Years_After_Formal_Training_Ended","281100049_Gendered_Perceptions_of_Land_Ownership_and_Agricultural_Decision-making_in_Ecuador_Who_Are_the_Farm_Managers_Jennifer_Twyman_Pilar_Useche_and_Carmen_Diana_Deere","271294424_Integrated_management_of_natural_resources_in_the_Ecuador_Highlands","297616355_Conservation_agriculture_on_steep_slopes_in_the_Andes_Promise_and_obstacles","295648868_Globalizing_Integrated_Pest_Management_A_Participatory_Research_Process","291245773_Understanding_Gender_and_Culture_in_Agriculture_The_Role_of_Qualitative_and_Quantitative_Approaches","281160435_The_Effect_of_the_Question_on_Survey_Response_A_Review","274141876_Measuring_agricultural_knowledge_and_adoption"]}
