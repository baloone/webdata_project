{"id":"354054563_On_the_characterization_of_tripled_partial_metrics_and_tripled_quasi-metrics","abstract":"The purpose of this study is to define a tripled partial metric, quasi-metric spaces, and present the relationship between the notion of tripled partial metric, which has applications in computer sciences, that of quasi-metric and that of standard metric. We give some simple formulations of the sequences convergence and of the completeness in tripled partial metric space.","authors":["Ghorban Khalilzadeh Ranjbar","Mohammad Esmael Samei","Negin Misaghian"],"meta":["June 2020TRANS- 40(1):1-9","Project: FIXED POINT THEORY"],"references":["334285857_A_generalization_of_fixed_point_theorems_about_F-contraction_in_particular_S-metric_spaces_and_characterization_of_quasi-contraction_maps_in_b-metric_spaces","332640055_Extended_Rectangular_b-Metric_Spaces_and_Some_Fixed_Point_Theorems_for_Contractive_Mappings","275831948_On_some_new_fixed_point_results_in_b-rectangular_metric_spaces","259463906_Some_coincidence_point_results_in_ordered_-metric_spaces_and_applications_in_a_system_of_integral_equations","242793128_The_Smyth_Completion","285079373_On_quasi-metric_spaces","268070656_Existence_and_uniqueness_of_solutions_to_a_system_of_functional_equations_and_applications_to_partial_metric_spaces","258211326_Caristi's_type_mappings_on_complete_partial_metric_spaces","257003400_Be_careful_on_partial_metric_fixed_point_results","243078335_The_Fixed_Point_Theory_for_Mappings_Satisfying_Inwardness_Conditions","241080625_Completeness_in_quasi-metric_spaces_and_Ekeland_Variational_Principle","220188878_Total_palindrome_complexity_of_finite_words","40892135_A_Kirk_Type_Characterization_of_Completeness_for_Partial_Metric_Spaces","227656324_Partial_Metric_Topology","221941315_Function_contractive_maps_in_partial_metric_spaces"]}
