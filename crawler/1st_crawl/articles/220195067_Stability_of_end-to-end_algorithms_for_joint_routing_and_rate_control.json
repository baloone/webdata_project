{"id":"220195067_Stability_of_end-to-end_algorithms_for_joint_routing_and_rate_control","abstract":"Dynamic multi-path routing has the potential to improve the reliability and performance of a communication network, but carries a risk. Routing needs to respond quickly to achieve the potential benefits, but not so quickly that the network is destabilized. This paper studies how rapidly routing can respond, without compromising stability.We present a sufficient condition for the local stability of end-to-end algorithms for joint routing and rate control. The network model considered allows an arbitrary interconnection of sources and resources, and heterogeneous propagation delays. The sufficient condition we present is decentralized: the responsiveness of each route is restricted by the round-trip time of that route alone, and not by the round-trip times of other routes. Our results suggest that stable, scalable load-sharing across paths, based on end-to-end measurements, can be achieved on the same rapid time-scale as rate control, namely the time-scale of round-trip times.","authors":["F.P.
