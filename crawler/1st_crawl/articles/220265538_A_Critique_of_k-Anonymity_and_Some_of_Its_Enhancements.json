{"id":"220265538_A_Critique_of_k-Anonymity_and_Some_of_Its_Enhancements","abstract":"k-Anonymity is a privacy property requiring that all combinations of key attributes in a database be repeated at least for k records. It has been shown that k-anonymity alone does not always ensure privacy. A number of sophistications of k-anonymity have been proposed, like p-sensitive k-anonymity, l-diversity and t-closeness. This paper explores the shortcomings of those properties, none of which turns out to be completely convincing.","authors":["Josep Domingo-Ferrer","Vicen√ß Torra"],"meta":["March 2008","DOI:10.1109/ARES.2008.97","SourceDBLP","Conference: Proceedings of the The Third International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security, ARES 2008, March 4-7, 2008, Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona , Spain"],"references":["304617026_OR_in_statistical_disclosure_control","221654462_Anonymity_An_Enhanced_Anonymity_Model_for_Privacy-Preservi_ng_Data_Publishing","262235629_Privacy-preserving_data_mining","261324639_Elements_of_Statistical_Disclosure_Control_Lecture_Notes_in_Statistics","246187774_Finding_a_needle_in_a_haystack-or_identifying_anonymous_census_record","239537667_The_invasion_of_privacy_problem_and_statistics_production_An_overview","226384458_Privacy_Preserving_Data_Mining","225639824_Privacy_Preserving_Data_Mining","224285701_L-diversity_Privacy_beyond_kanonymity","221310695_Minimality_Attack_in_Privacy_Preserving_Data_Publishing"]}
