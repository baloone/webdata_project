{"id":"329599270_Fuzzy_intensional_semantics","abstract":"The study of weighted structures is one of the important trends in recent computer science. The aim of the article is to provide a weighted, many-valued version of classical intensional semantics formalised in the framework of higher-order fuzzy logics. We illustrate the apparatus on several variants of fuzzy S5-style modalities. The formalism is applicable to a broad array of weighted intensional notions, including alethic, epistemic, or probabilistic modalities, generalised quantifiers, counterfactual conditionals, dynamic and non-monotonic logics, and some more.","authors":["Libor Behounek","Ondrej Majer"],"meta":["October 2018Journal of Applied Non-Classical Logics 28(4):348-388","DOI:10.1080/11663081.2018.1525207"],"references":["267009206_Introduction_to_mathematical_fuzzy_logic","263161466_The_Concept_of_Information_and_the_Development_of_Modern_Logic","322287139_On_the_logical_formalization_of_possibilistic_counterparts_of_states_over_n-valued_Lukasiewicz_events","320496686_Neighborhood_semantics_for_modal_many-valued_logics","301950326_On_Possibilistic_Modal_Logics_Defined_Over_MTL-Chains","298326722_A_minimalistic_many-valued_theory_of_types","278108002_Fuzzy_class_theory","273478063_Maxima_and_minima_in_fuzzified_linear_orderings","268893774_Fuzzification_of_Groenendijk-Stokhof_propositional_erotetic_logic","267432994_A_semantics_for_counterfactuals_based_on_fuzzy_logic"]}
