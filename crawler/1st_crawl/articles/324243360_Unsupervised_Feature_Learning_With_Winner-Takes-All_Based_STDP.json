{"id":"324243360_Unsupervised_Feature_Learning_With_Winner-Takes-All_Based_STDP","abstract":"We present a novel strategy for unsupervised feature learning in image applications inspired by the Spike-Timing-Dependent-Plasticity (STDP) biological learning rule. We show equivalence between rank order coding Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire neurons and ReLU artificial neurons when applied to non-temporal data. We apply this to images using rank-order coding, which allows us to perform a full network simulation with a single feed-forward pass using GPU hardware. Next we introduce a binary STDP learning rule compatible with training on batches of images. Two mechanisms to stabilize the training are also presented : a Winner-Takes-All (WTA) framework which selects the most relevant patches to learn from along the spatial dimensions, and a simple feature-wise normalization as homeostatic process. This learning process allows us to train multi-layer architectures of convolutional sparse features. We apply our method to extract features from the MNIST, ETH80, CIFAR-10, and STL-10 datasets and show that these features are relevant for classification. We finally compare these results with several other state of the art unsupervised learning methods.","authors":["Paul Ferr√©","Franck Mamalet","Simon Jonathan Thorpe"],"meta":["April 2018Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience 12:24","DOI:10.3389/fncom.2018.00024"],"references":["309673746_STDP-based_spiking_deep_convolutional_neural_networks_for_object_recognition","309169612_Theta-Gamma_Coding_Meets_Communication-through-Coherence_Neuronal_Oscillatory_Multiplexing_Theories_Reconciled","325025933_First-Spike-Based_Visual_Categorization_Using_Reward-Modulated_STDP","322905671_GXNOR-Net_Training_deep_neural_networks_with_ternary_weights_and_activations_without_full-precision_memory_under_a_unified_discretization_framework","319770395_An_Analysis_of_Single-Layer_Networks_in_Unsupervised_Feature_Learning","319770355_Generative_Adversarial_Nets","317164097_Gated_XNOR_Networks_Deep_Neural_Networks_with_Ternary_Weights_and_Activations_under_a_Unified_Discretization_Framework","313054161_STDP_enables_spiking_neurons_to_detect_hidden_causes_of_their_inputs","309916993_Conversion_of_Artificial_Recurrent_Neural_Networks_to_Spiking_Neural_Networks_for_Low-power_Neuromorphic_Hardware","309778545_Unsupervised_regenerative_learning_of_hierarchical_features_in_Spiking_Deep_Networks_for_object_recognition"]}
