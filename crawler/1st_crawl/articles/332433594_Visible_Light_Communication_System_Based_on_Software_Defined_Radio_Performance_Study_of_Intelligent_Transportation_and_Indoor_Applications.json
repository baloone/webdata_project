{"id":"332433594_Visible_Light_Communication_System_Based_on_Software_Defined_Radio_Performance_Study_of_Intelligent_Transportation_and_Indoor_Applications","abstract":"In this paper, our first attempt at visible light communication system, based on software defined radio (SDR) and implemented in LabVIEW is introduced. This paper mainly focuses on two most commonly used types of LED lights, ceiling lights and LED car lamps/tail-lights. The primary focus of this study is to determine the basic parameters of real implementation of visible light communication (VLC) system, such as transmit speed, communication errors (bit-error ratio, error vector magnitude, energy per bit to noise power spectral density ratio) and highest reachable distance. This work focuses on testing various multistate quadrature amplitude modulation (M-QAM). We have used Skoda Octavia III tail-light and Phillips indoor ceiling light as transmitters and SI PIN Thorlabs photodetector as receiver. Testing method for each light was different. When testing ceiling light, we have focused on reachable distance for each M-QAM variant. On the other side, Octavia tail-light was tested in variable nature conditions (such as thermal turbulence, rain, fog) simulated in special testing box. This work will present our solution, measured parameters and possible weak spots, which will be adjusted in the future.","authors":["Radek Martinek","Lukas Danys","Rene Jaros"],"meta":["April 2019Electronics 8(4):433","DOI:10.3390/electronics8040433"],"references":["349255570_Wireless_Data_Transmission_for_the_Battery_Management_System_of_Electric_and_Hybrid_Vehicles","330610562_An_Overview_of_Vehicular_Communications","327680252_Multiple_Access_Techniques_for_5G_Wireless_Networks_and_Beyond","327328950_Social_vehicle-to-everything_V2X_communication_model_for_intelligent_transportation_systems_based_on_5G_scenario","326286004_A_Survey_on_the_Roadmap_to_Mandate_on_Board_Connectivity_and_Enable_V2V-Based_Vehicular_Sensor_Networks","328206423_On_Feasibility_of_VLC_Based_Car-to-Car_Communication_Under_Solar_Irradiance_and_Fog_Conditions","327328181_Sandstorm_Effect_on_Visible_Light_Communication","327299269_Optimal_Minimization_of_Plug-In_Electric_Vehicle_Charging_Cost_With_Vehicle-to-Home_and_Vehicle-to-Grid_Concepts","326361108_Connected_Roads_of_the_Future_Use_Cases_Requirements_and_Design_Considerations_for_Vehicle-to-Everything_Communications","326048233_Image_Sensor_Communications_for_future_ITS"]}
