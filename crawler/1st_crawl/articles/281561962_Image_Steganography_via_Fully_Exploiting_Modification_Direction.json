{"id":"281561962_Image_Steganography_via_Fully_Exploiting_Modification_Direction","abstract":"Embedding bits by replacing pixel's least-significant bit (LSB) is a simple but great idea. Nevertheless, this method is not safe enough. Afterwards, a series of effective and safe algorithms which are based on LSB substitution method were proposed such as EMD (exploiting modification direction) and EMD-2. EMD, modifying at most one of n pixels' LSB to embed a (2n+1) -ary notational system number, achieved higher embedding efficiency than LSB method. EMD-2 modifys at most two of a group n pixels to embed a (10n-13) -ary (n > 2) notational system number, making embedding capacity improved compared with EMD. To improve embedding capacity further, we proposed a new method EMD-3 exploiting modification direction fully. EMD-3 modifys a group of n pixels by Â±1 to embed a secret digit in 3n -ary notational system. The experimental results demonstrate that EMD-3 can improve embedding capacity and preserve good image quality at the same time. Besides, EMD-3 is as secure as EMD and EMD-2.","authors":["Xuejing Niu","Meng ma","Rui Tang","Zhaoxia Yin"],"meta":["May 2015International Journal of Security and its Applications 9(5):243-254","DOI:10.14257/ijsia.2015.9.5.24"],"references":["287534626_Data_hiding_algorithm_with_high_payload_based_on_pixel_pair_matching","262248599_Trends_in_steganography","262236864_Moving_Steganography_and_Steganalysis_from_the_Laboratory_into_the_Real_World","312888624_Efficient_steganographic_embedding_by_exploiting_modification_direction","312771295_Image_quality_assessment_From_error_visibility_to_structural_similarity","267470978_A_digital_watermarking_embedding_algorithm_based_on_biorthogonal_wavelet_transform_for_color_images","260558514_A_High_Capacity_Data_Hiding_Scheme_for_Binary_Images_Based_on_Block_Patterns","257666529_Visible_watermarking_images_in_high_quality_of_data_hiding","256991989_An_improvement_of_diamond_encoding_using_characteristic_value_positioning_and_modulus_function","256721223_Adaptive_image_data_hiding_in_edges_using_patched_reference_table_and_pair-wise_embedding_technique"]}
