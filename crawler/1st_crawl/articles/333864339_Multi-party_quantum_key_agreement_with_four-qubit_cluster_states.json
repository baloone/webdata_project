{"id":"333864339_Multi-party_quantum_key_agreement_with_four-qubit_cluster_states","abstract":"Based on four-qubit cluster states, we present a new multi-party quantum key agreement (QKA) protocol. The proposed protocol makes full use of four-qubit cluster states as quantum resources and performs the X operation to generate a shared key. In addition, our multi-party QKA protocol ensures each participant to contribute equally to the final key. Compared with other existed multi-party QKA protocols, our protocol has high efficiency. Furthermore, the security analysis shows that our protocol can resist the outsider and participant attacks.","authors":["Hao-Nan Liu","Xiang-Qian Liang","Dong-Huan Jiang","Guang-Bao Xu"],"meta":["June 2019Quantum Information Processing 18(8)","DOI:10.1007/s11128-019-2346-y"],"references":["330143269_Arbitrary_Quantum_Signature_Based_on_Local_Indistinguishability_of_Orthogonal_Product_States","327560095_Multiparty_Quantum_Key_Agreement_with_Four-Qubit_Symmetric_W_State","325697389_Multiparty_quantum_key_agreement_protocol_based_on_locally_indistinguishable_orthogonal_product_states","324786486_Two-party_quantum_key_agreement_protocols_under_collective_noise_channel","323861929_Multi-party_quantum_key_agreement_with_five-qubit_brown_states","318194822_Cryptanalysis_of_a_multiparty_quantum_key_agreement_protocol_based_on_commutative_encryption","316471515_Invisible_Trojan-horse_attack","329051401_Multi-party_Quantum_Key_Agreement_Against_Collective_Noise_First_International_Conference_SciSec_2018_Beijing_China_August_12-14_2018_Revised_Selected_Papers","327725653_A_Denoising-Decomposition_Model_Combining_TV_Minimisation_and_Fractional_Derivatives","324709730_Extended_analysis_of_the_Trojan-horse_attack_in_quantum_key_distribution"]}
