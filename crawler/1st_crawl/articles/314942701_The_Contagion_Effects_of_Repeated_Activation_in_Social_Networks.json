{"id":"314942701_The_Contagion_Effects_of_Repeated_Activation_in_Social_Networks","abstract":"Demonstrations, protests, riots, and shifts in public opinion respond to the coordinating potential of communication networks. Digital technologies have turned interpersonal networks into massive, pervasive structures that constantly pulsate with information. Here, we propose a model that aims to analyze the contagion dynamics that emerge in networks when repeated activation is allowed, that is, when actors can engage recurrently in a collective effort. We analyze how the structure of communication networks impacts on the ability to coordinate actors, and we identify the conditions under which large-scale coordination is more likely to emerge.","authors":["Pablo Piedrahita","Javier Borge-Holthoefer","Yamir Moreno","Sandra González-Bailón"],"meta":["March 2017Social Networks 54","DOI:10.1016/j.socnet.2017.11.001","Project: Computational Social Science"],"references":["284752173_Novelty_and_Collective_Attention","283755054_Online_social_networks_and_offline_protest","282531897_Networked_discontent_The_anatomy_of_protest_campaigns_in_social_media","331154188_Threshold_models_of_social_influence","314534126_Dissecting_the_Spirit_of_Gezi_Influence_vs_Selection_in_the_Occupy_Gezi_Movement","310468660_Quantifying_the_power_and_consequences_of_social_media_protest","304374264_Centrality_in_social_networks_Conceptual_clarification","291591600_Small_change_Why_the_revolution_will_not_be_tweeted","285371110_The_Critical_Periphery_in_the_Growth_of_Social_Protests","283980784_Hijacking_myNYPD_Social_Media_Dissent_and_Networked_Counterpublics"]}
