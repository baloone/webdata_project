{"id":"271390398_Artificial_General_Intelligence_Concept_State_of_the_Art_and_Future_Prospects","abstract":"In recent years broad community of researchers has emerged, focusing on the original ambitious goals of the AI field - the creation and study of software or hardware systems with general intelligence comparable to, and ultimately perhaps greater than, that of human beings. This paper surveys this diverse community and its progress. Approaches to defining the concept of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) are reviewed including mathematical formalisms, engineering, and biology inspired perspectives. The spectrum of designs for AGI systems includes systems with symbolic, emergentist, hybrid and universalist characteristics. Metrics for general intelligence are evaluated, with a conclusion that, although metrics for assessing the achievement of human-level AGI may be relatively straightforward (e.g. the Turing Test, or a robot that can graduate from elementary school or university), metrics for assessing partial progress remain more controversial and problematic.","authors":["Ben Goertzel"],"meta":["January 2014Journal of Artificial General Intelligence","DOI:10.2478/jagi-2014-0001"],"references":["319770464_Magic_Materials_a_theory_of_deep_hierarchical_architectures_for_learning_sensory_representations","320182421_Superintelligence_paths_dangers_strategies","313441382_Is_it_an_Agent_or_Just_a_Program_A_Taxonomy_for_Autonomous_Agents","313080466_Exploring_the_predictable","308468610_Speech_and_language_processing_An_introduction_to_natural_language_processing_computational_linguistics_and_speech_recognition","303783516_Nine_ways_to_bias_open-source_AGI_toward_friendliness","291412268_Artificial_General_Intelligence_and_the_Future_of_Humanity","288917271_The_Architecture_of_Human-Like_General_Intelligence","285936339_Principles_of_Synthetic_Intelligence_PSI_An_Architecture_of_Motivated_Cognition","284500218_Artificial_intelligence_as_a_positive_and_negative_factor_in_global_risk"]}
