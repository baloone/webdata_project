{"id":"345871070_Artificial_Intelligence_and_Virtual_Assistant-Working_Model","abstract":"In twenty-first-century virtual assistant is playing a very crucial role in day to day activities of human. According to the survey report of Clutch in 2019, 27% of the people are using the AI-powered virtual assistant such as: Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, Cortana, Apple Siri, etc., for performing a simple task, people are using virtual assistant designed with natural language processing. In this research paper, we have studied and analyzed the working model and the efficiency of different virtual assistants available in the market. We also designed an intelligent virtual assistant that could be integrated with Google virtual services and work with the Google virtual assistant interface. A comparative analysis of the traffic and message communication with length of conversation for approximately three days is taken as input to calculate the efficiency of the designed virtual assistant.\n\nKeywords\nVirtual assistant, Artificial intelligence, NLP, IoT, NLG","authors":["Shakti Arora","Vijay Anant Athavale","Himanshu Maggu","Abhay Agarwal"],"meta":["January 2021","DOI:10.1007/978-981-15-7130-5_12","In book: Mobile Radio Communications and 5G Networks (pp.163-171)"],"references":["330165159_Survey_on_Virtual_Assistant_Google_Assistant_Siri_Cortana_Alexa_4th_International_Symposium_SIRS_2018_Bangalore_India_September_19-22_2018_Revised_Selected_Papers","264001644_Virtual_Personal_Assistant","221996750_Artificial_Intelligence_-_A_Modern_Approach"]}
