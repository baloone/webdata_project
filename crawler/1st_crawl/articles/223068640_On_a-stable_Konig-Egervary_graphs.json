{"id":"223068640_On_a-stable_Konig-Egervary_graphs","abstract":"The stability number of a graph G, denoted by α(G), is the cardinality of a stable set of maximum size in G. If its stability number remains the same upon the addition of any edge, then G is called α+-stable. G is a König–Egerváry graph if its order equals α(G)+μ(G), where μ(G) is the size of a maximum matching in G. In this paper, we characterize α+-stable König–Egerváry graphs, generalizing some previously known results on bipartite graphs and trees. Namely, we prove that a König–Egerváry graph G=(V,E) of order at least two is α+-stable if and only if G has a perfect matching and (where Ω(G) denotes the family of all maximum stable sets of G). We also show that the equality is a necessary and sufficient condition for a König–Egerváry graph G to have a perfect matching. Finally, we describe the two following types of α+-stable König–Egerváry graphs: those with and , respectively.","authors":["Vadim Levit","Eugen Mandrescu"],"meta":["February 2003Discrete Mathematics 263(1-3):179-190","DOI:10.1016/S0012-365X(02)00528-9","Project: König-Egerváry graphs"],"references":["265916101_Changing_and_unchanging_of_the_graphical_invariants_Minimum_and_maximum_degree_maximum_clique_size_node_independence_number_and_edge_independence_number","229456180_Vertex_domination-critical_graphs","226831014_Ear-decompositions_of_matching-covered_graphs","283559921_Paths_trees_flowers","267672253_Well-covered_and_Koenig-Egervary_graphs","265332608_Vertices_Belonging_to_All_or_to_No_Maximum_Stable_Sets_of_a_Graph","265326809_On_a_-stable_graphs","256693701_On_the_structure_of_-stable_graphs","246999758_On_Combinatorial_Properties_of_Matrices","242910977_Domination_Critical_Graphs_with_Higher_Independent_Domination_Numbers","242910852_Independence_and_Hamiltonicity_in_3-Domination-Critical_Graphs","234800642_Matchings_and_extensions","230596039_Matching_theory","228057818_Combinatorial_Optimiation_Networks_and_Matroids","223707566_A_generalization_of_Konig-Egervary_graphs_and_heuristics_for_the_maximum_independent_set_problem_with_improved_approximation_ratios","222773764_Independence_numbers_of_graphs-an_extension_of_the_Koenig-Egervary_theorem","222361196_Domination_Critical_Graphs","220620082_The_effects_of_vertex_deletion_and_edge_deletion_on_the_clique_partition_number","220570249_Konig-Egervary_graphs_2-bicritical_graphs_and_fractional_matchings","220569820_Graphs_whose_Vertex_Independence_Number_is_Unaffected_by_Single_Edge_Addition_of_Deletion","220186436_A_note_on_the_irredundance_number_after_vertex_deletion","220077451_A_characterization_of_the_graphs_in_which_the_transversal_number_equals_the_matching_number"]}
