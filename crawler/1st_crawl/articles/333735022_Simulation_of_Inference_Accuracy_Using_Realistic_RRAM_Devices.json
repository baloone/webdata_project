{"id":"333735022_Simulation_of_Inference_Accuracy_Using_Realistic_RRAM_Devices","abstract":"Resistive Random Access Memory (RRAM) is a promising technology for power efficient hardware in applications of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) implemented in non-von Neumann architectures. However, there is an unanswered question if the device non-idealities preclude the use of RRAM devices in this potentially disruptive technology. Here we investigate the question for the case of inference. Using experimental results from silicon oxide (SiO \nx\n) RRAM devices, that we use as proxies for physical weights, we demonstrate that acceptable accuracies in classification of handwritten digits (MNIST data set) can be achieved using non-ideal devices. We find that, for this test, the ratio of the high- and low-resistance device states is a crucial determinant of classification accuracy, with ~96.8% accuracy achievable for ratios >3, compared to ~97.3% accuracy achieved with ideal weights. Further, we investigate the effects of a finite number of discrete resistance states, sub-100% device yield, devices stuck at one of the resistance states, current/voltage non-linearities, programming non-linearities and device-to-device variability. Detailed analysis of the effects of the non-idealities will better inform the need for the optimization of particular device properties.","authors":["Adnan Mehonic","Dovydas Joksas","Wing H Ng","Mark Buckwell"],"meta":["June 2019Frontiers in Neuroscience 13","DOI:10.3389/fnins.2019.00593"],"references":["328888027_Memristor_crossbar_arrays_with_6-nm_half-pitch_and_2-nm_critical_dimension","328352112_A_phase-change_memory_model_for_neuromorphic_computing","326165632_The_interplay_between_structure_and_function_in_redox-based_resistance_switching","326072457_Silicon_Oxide_SiO_x_A_Promising_Material_for_Resistance_Switching","325605113_Equivalent-accuracy_accelerated_neural-network_training_using_analogue_memory","324957332_The_over-reset_phenomenon_in_Ta2O5_RRAM_device_investigated_by_the_RTN-based_defect_probing_technique","322334492_Brain-inspired_computing_with_resistive_switching_memory_RRAM_Devices_synapses_and_neural_networks","327735358_Tutorial_Brain-inspired_computing_using_phase-change_memory_devices","322672227_Neuro-Inspired_Computing_With_Emerging_Nonvolatile_Memory","322462451_Effect_of_Conductance_Linearity_and_Multi-level_Cell_Characteristics_of_TaOx-based_Synapse_Device_on_Pattern_Recognition_Accuracy_of_Neuromorphic_System"]}
