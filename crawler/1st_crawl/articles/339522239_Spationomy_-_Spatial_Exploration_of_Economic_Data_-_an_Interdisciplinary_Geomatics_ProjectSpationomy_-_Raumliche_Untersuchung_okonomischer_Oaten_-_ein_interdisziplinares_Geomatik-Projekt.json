Nowadays, the importance of the geospatial component inherent with most economic data is rapidly increasing. Therefore, added value from bringing geospatial aspects in economic data analyses is highly appreciated. The aim of the Spationomy project is to improve students’ interdisciplinary skills by interconnecting the different fields of business management, business informatics, geomatics and geoinformatics. At this students are supposed to learn and adopt combined methodologies, techniques and tools. They will be actors in “economic/business analytics games”, deployed to structure group-based and student-led investigations of advanced economic and spatial data analyses. They will simulate “economic/business analytics issues from real world” via games during short-term intensive courses striving to bring economics/business and (geo)information together. This article focuses on the presentation of an interdisciplinary project called SPATIONOMY in the frame of ERASMUS+ after the first year of implementation.","authors":["Carsten Jürgens","Nicolai Moos","Andreas Redecker"],"meta":["March 2018KN - Journal of Cartography and Geographic Information 68(2):66-71","DOI:10.1007/BF03544526","Project: SPATIONOMY"],"references":["299981435_Spatial_Data_Analysis_Theory_and_Practice","222662654_Discovery_learning_representation_and_explanation_within_a_computer-based_simulation_Finding_the_right_mix","32231113_Scientific_Discovery_Learning_With_Computer_Simulations_of_Conceptual_Domains","329647611_The_Spatial_Economy_Cities_Regions_and_International_Trade","322178806_Geogames_and_Geoplay_Game-based_Approaches_to_the_Analysis_of_Geo-Information","320161995_MAPPING_THE_ECONOMIC_DATA_-_CASE_STUDIES_AND_BEST_PRACTICES","319268269_Comparison_of_Fuzzy_AHP_Algorithms_for_Land_Suitability_Assessment","317746304_Economic_analysis_and_spatial_arrangements_of_engineering_SMEs_performance_in_Olomouc_region_of_Czech_Republic","316799442_Studies_in_Operational_Regional_Science","240661600_The_Oxford_Handbook_of_Economic_Geography"]}
