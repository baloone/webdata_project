{"id":"274403371_Predicting_the_long-term_citation_impact_of_recent_publications","abstract":"A fundamental problem in citation analysis is the prediction of the long-term\ncitation impact of recent publications. We propose a model to predict a\nprobability distribution for the future number of citations of a publication.\nTwo predictors are used: The impact factor of the journal in which a\npublication has appeared and the number of citations a publication has received\none year after its appearance. The proposed model is based on quantile\nregression. We employ the model to predict the future number of citations of a\nlarge set of publications in the field of physics. Our analysis shows that both\npredictors (i.e., impact factor and early citations) contribute to the accurate\nprediction of long-term citation impact. We also analytically study the\nbehavior of the quantile regression coefficients for high quantiles of the\ndistribution of citations. This is done by linking the quantile regression\napproach to a quantile estimation technique from extreme value theory. Our work\nprovides insight into the influence of the impact factor and early citations on\nthe long-term citation impact of a publication, and it takes a step toward a\nmethodology that can be used to assess research institutions based on their\nmost recently published work.","authors":["Clara Stegehuis","Nelly Litvak","Ludo Waltman"],"meta":["March 2015Journal of Informetrics 9(3)","DOI:10.1016/j.joi.2015.06.005","SourcearXiv"],"references":["269386674_Citation_impact_prediction_for_scientific_papers_using_stepwise_regression_analysis","268232338_High-Ranked_Social_Science_Journal_Articles_Can_Be_Identified_from_Early_Citation_Information","257350831_Quantifying_Long-Term_Scientific_Impact","233289685_A_Fitness_Model_for_Scholarly_Impact_Analysis","230841691_Future_impact_Predicting_scientific_success","228266138_The_Skewness_of_Science_in_219_Sub-Fields_and_a_Number_of_Aggregates","227137093_What_Makes_an_Article_Influential_Predicting_Impact_in_Social_and_Personality_Psychology","222576981_The_drivers_of_citations_in_management_science_journals","220365133_Sleeping_Beauties_in_Science","220365037_The_skewness_of_science_in_219_sub-fields_and_a_number_of_aggregates","220364575_Citations_versus_Journal_Impact_Factor_as_Proxy_of_Quality_Could_the_Latter_Ever_Be_Preferable","31970501_Exploring_the_dynamics_of_journal_citations_Modelling_with_s-curves","5560343_Prediction_of_citation_counts_for_clinical_articles_at_two_years_using_data_available_within_three_weeks_of_publication_Retrospective_cohort_study","2209752_Modeling_a_Century_of_Citation_Distributions","1946763_How_Popular_Is_Your_Paper_An_Empirical_Study_of_the_Citation_Distribution","312729484_Regression_quantiles","312341661_A_robust_estimator_for_the_asymptotic_behavior_of_certain_time_series","312153251_Quantile_regressions","279928231_High-precision_calibration_of_spherical_surface_misalignment_based_on_difference_method","275975030_Mendeley_Readership_Altmetrics_for_Medical_Articles_An_Analysis_of_45_Fields","262492372_Factors_Affecting_Citation_Rates_of_Research_Articles","259783194_Do_altmetrics_correlate_with_citations_Extensive_comparison_of_altmetric_indicators_with_citations_from_a_multidisciplinary_perspective","257692418_Development_a_case-based_classifier_for_predicting_highly_cited_papers","257692200_The_problem_of_citation_impact_assessments_for_recent_publication_years_in_institutional_evaluations","257662878_Citation_time_window_choice_for_research_impact_evaluation","257103562_On_the_reliability_of_predictions_based_on_stochastic_citation_processes","256804987_Which_Factors_Help_Authors_Produce_the_Highest_Impact_Research_Collaboration_Journal_and_Document_Properties","239731773_Which_percentile-based_approach_should_be_preferred_for_calculating_normalized_citation_impact_values_An_empirical_comparison_of_five_approaches_including_a_newly_developed_citation-rank_approach_P100","238832566_Patterns_of_annual_citation_of_highly_cited_articles_and_the_prediction_of_their_citation_ranking_A_comparison_across_subjects","238382811_Determinants_of_Research_Citation_Impact_in_Nanoscience_and_Nanotechnology","237000136_Are_your_data_really_Pareto_distributed","233801137_Regression_Quantile","227673009_A_General_Theory_of_Bibliometric_and_Other_Cumulative_Advantage_Processes","227604791_Earlier_Web_Usage_Statistics_as_Predictors_of_Later_Citation_Impact","220434823_Predicting_future_citation_behavior","220434344_On_Determinants_of_Citation_Scores_A_Case_Study_in_Chemical_Engineering","220365422_Mining_typical_features_for_highly_cited_papers","220364931_Early_citation_counts_correlate_with_accumulated_impact","220364547_Using_content-based_and_bibliometric_features_for_machine_learning_models_to_predict_citation_counts_in_the_biomedical_literature","220364360_Predicting_subsequent_citations_to_articles_published_in_twelve_crime-psychology_journals_Author_impact_versus_journal_impact","220230934_A_combined_bibliometric_indicator_to_predict_article_impact","220228996_Modeling_Citation_Behavior_in_Management_Science_Journals","220019832_Regression_Quantiles","46430187_Scoring_research_output_using_statistical_quantile_plotting","45658491_Predicting_Long-Term_Citation_Impact_of_Articles_in_Social_and_Personality_Psychology","38359349_A_Moment_Estimator_for_the_Index_of_an_Extreme-Value_Distribution","38358002_A_Simple_General_Approach_to_Inference_About_the_Tail_of_a_Distribution","9259405_Networks_Of_Scientific_Papers","1893485_Power-Law_Distributions_in_Empirical_Data"]}
