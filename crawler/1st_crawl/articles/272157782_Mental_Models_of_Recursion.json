{"id":"272157782_Mental_Models_of_Recursion","abstract":"This article presents the results of a two-year study of children's difficulties in learning the concept of recursion in Logo. A number of incorrect mental models of recursion identified in the study are described. These are classified into main groups: mental models associated with the interpretation of recursive procedures and those associated with the construction of recursive procedures. Misconceptions underlying the erroneous mental models are presented. Possible reasons for adopting these misconceptions are put forward.","authors":["Darina Dicheva","Sean Close"],"meta":["January 1996Journal of Educational Computing Research 14(1):1-23","DOI:10.2190/AGG9-A5UD-DEK0-80EN"],"references":["220420651_Cognitive_Strategies_and_Looping_Constructs_An_Empirical_Study","271815008_Mental_Strategies_and_Materials_or_Models_for_Addition_and_Subtraction_up_to_100_in_Dutch_Second_Grades","271729852_Pascal_and_High_School_Students_A_Study_of_Errors","271729781_Conjectures_Concerning_The_Origins_of_Misconceptions_In_Logo","270321482_Cognitive_Models_Underlying_Students'_Formulation_of_Simple_Linear_Equations","238714333_Cognitive_Implications_of_Learning_Prolog-Mistakes_and_Misconceptions","231167919_Some_Difficulties_of_Learning_to_Program","222440010_Capturing_and_Modeling_the_Process_of_Conceptual_Change","221413295_Learning_Recursion_Through_the_Use_of_a_Mental_Model-Based_Programming_Environment","220425062_A_Diagnosis_of_Beginning_Programmers'_Misconceptions_of_BASIC_Programming_Statements","220420384_Novice_Mistakes_Are_the_Folk_Wisdoms_Correct","32231255_Language-Independent_Conceptual_Bugs_in_Novice_Programming","3188683_PROUST_Knowledge-based_program_understanding"]}
