{"id":"222441371_Applications_of_Circumscription_to_Formalizing_Common_Sense_Knowledge","abstract":"We present a new and more symmetric version of the circumscription method of non-monotonic reasoning first described by McCarthy [9] and some applications to formalizing common-sense knowledge. The applications in this paper are mostly based on minimizing the abnormality of different aspects of various entities. Included are non-monotonic treatments of “is-a” hierarchies, the unique names hypothesis, and the frame problem. The new circumscription may be called formula circumscription to distinguish it from the previously defined domain circumscription and predicate circumscription. A still more general formalism called prioritized circumscription is briefly explored.","authors":["John McCarthy"],"meta":["January 1984Artificial Intelligence 28(1):89-116","DOI:10.1016/0004-3702(86)90032-9","SourceCiteSeer"],"references":["267258415_EKL-An_Interactive_Proof_Checker_User's_Reference_Manual","233856980_On_the_adequacy_of_predicate_circumscription_for_closed-world_reasoning","230876628_Readings_in_Artificial_Intelligence","225070561_Some_Philosophical_Problems_from_the_Standpoint_of_Artificial_Intelligence","222724263_A_Decidable_Fragment_of_Predicate_Calculus","222437972_Circumscription-A_Form_of_Non-Mon-otonic_Reasoning","221606494_Circumscription_Implies_Predicate_Completion_Sometimes","221535778_On_the_Adequacy_of_Predicate_Circumscription_for_Closed-World_Reasoning","220815833_Computing_Circumscription","220815513_Epistemological_Problems_of_Artificial_Intelligence","220547100_A_Logic_for_Default_Reasoning","220431964_Equality_and_Domain_Closure_in_First-Order_Databases","2552293_Programs_with_Common_Sense","2508873_The_Common_Business_Communication_Language"]}
