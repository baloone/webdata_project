{"id":"301429175_Introducing_teachers_to_computational_thinking_using_unplugged_storytelling","abstract":"Many countries are introducing new school computing syllabuses that make programming and computational thinking core components. However, many of the teachers involved have major knowledge, skill and pedagogy gaps. We have explored the effectiveness of using 'unplugged' methods (constructivist, often kinaesthetic, activities away from computers) with contextually rich storytelling to introduce teachers to these topics in a non-threatening way. We describe the approach we have used in workshops for teachers and its survey based evaluation. Teachers were highly positive that the approach was inspiring, confidence building and gave them a greater understanding of the concepts involved, as well as giving practical teaching techniques that they would use.","authors":["Paul Curzon","Peter W.
