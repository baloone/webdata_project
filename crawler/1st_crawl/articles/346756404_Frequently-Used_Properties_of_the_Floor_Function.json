{"id":"346756404_Frequently-Used_Properties_of_the_Floor_Function","abstract":"The paper collects 42 frequently-used properties of the floor function, including 35 ones from other literatures and 7 newly added-and-proved ones. The collected properties cover basic inequalities, basic identities, conditional inequalities, conditional equalities and practical formulas. The paper is helpful for scholars of mathematics and computer science and technology in reading and writing scientific works, reasoning and designing algorithms.","authors":["Xingbo Wang"],"meta":["January 2020International Journal of Applied Physics and Mathematics 10(4):135-142","DOI:10.17706/ijapm.2020.10.4.135-142"],"references":["327038702_Some_Inequalities_on_T3_Tree","325445032_T_3_Tree_and_Its_Traits_in_Understanding_Integers","323851542_Some_New_Inequalities_With_Proofs_and_Comments_on_Applications","320009486_Brief_Summary_of_Frequently-used_Properties_of_the_Floor_Function","319649614_Some_More_New_Properties_of_Consecutive_Odd_Numbers","316913462_Strategy_for_Algorithm_Design_in_Factoring_RSA_Numbers","312384397_A_mean-value_formula_for_the_floor_function_on_integers"]}
