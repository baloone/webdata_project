{"id":"309170985_Green_and_reliable_software-defined_industrial_networks","abstract":"The FGIR calls for reliable, flexible, and green industrial networks to support intelligent manufacturing. This article proposes a new architecture of SDIN and then presents the related key technologies. The proposed architecture adopts an all-IP-based flat structure, and can adaptively reconfigure networks according to the dynamic change of product orders. The crucial technologies can guarantee real-time data transmission, enable plug-and-play, and support wireless access with seamless handover capability. Energy can be reduced significantly by optimizing routes and shutting down redundant production lines. Experimental results show that our solution can achieve highly reliable and deterministic packet delivery. With the adaptive configurations in the testbed, SDIN can consume 18 percent-less energy than traditional industrial networks.","authors":["Dong Li","Ming-Tuo Zhou","Peng Zeng","Ming Yang"],"meta":["October 2016IEEE Communications Magazine 54(10):30-37","DOI:10.1109/MCOM.2016.7588226"],"references":["306264010_A_System_Architecture_for_Software-Defined_Industrial_Internet_of_Things","301745021_Software_Defined_Networking_With_Pseudonym_Systems_for_Secure_Vehicular_Clouds","282076943_6TiSCH_centralized_scheduling_When_SDN_meet_IoT","280630785_A_System_Architecture_for_Software-Defined_Industrial_Internet_of_Things","277902299_Demand_Response_Management_in_the_Smart_Grid_in_a_Large_Population_Regime","262805723_Software-Defined_Networking_A_Comprehensive_Survey","259294766_Computer_Communication_Within_Industrial_Distributed_Environment-a_Survey","259179104_Sensor_OpenFlow_Enabling_Software-Defined_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","292694068_Software_Defined_Networking_for_Communication_and_Control_of_Cyber-Physical_Systems","286240736_Applicability_of_Software_Defined_Networking_in_industrial_Ethernet","283845612_Service_provider_competition_and_cooperation_in_cloud-based_software_defined_wireless_networks","264937613_An_Industrial_Perspective_on_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_-_A_Survey_of_Requirements_Protocols_and_Challenges"]}
