{"id":"319350239_A_lower_bound_on_the_size_of_an_absorbing_set_in_an_arc-coloured_tournament","abstract":"Bousquet, Lochet and Thomass\\'e recently gave an elegant proof that for any integer $n$, there is a least integer $f(n)$ such that any tournament whose arcs are coloured with $n$ colours contains a subset of vertices $S$ of size $f(n)$ with the property that any vertex not in $S$ admits a monochromatic path to some vertex of $S$. In this note we provide a lower bound on the value $f(n)$.","authors":["Laurent Beaudou","Luc Devroye","Gena Hahn"],"meta":["August 2017Discrete Mathematics 342(1)","DOI:10.1016/j.disc.2018.09.013"],"references":["315570270_A_proof_of_the_ErdHos-Sands-Sauer-Woodrow_conjecture","262280004_Covering_with_Euclidean_Boxes","243788242_On_monochromatic_paths_in_m-coloured_tournaments","235645414_Domination_in_transitive_colorings_of_tournaments","223227606_Counterexample_to_a_conjecture_on_edge-coloured_tournaments","223149024_On_monochromatic_paths_in_edge-coloured_digraphs","220188766_Absorbing_sets_in_arc-coloured_tournaments"]}
