{"id":"350857307_Research_on_Smart_Learning_System_Model","abstract":"With the development of computer science in our country, more and more intelligent products appear in people’s daily lives, bringing convenience to people’s lives. In the education industry, an intelligent learning system has also emerged. After learning the relevant knowledge of the construction of the intelligent learning system and the Apriori algorithm, this article builds the intelligent learning system based on the Apriori algorithm, and take the university physics department as an example to study and analyse the function and realization of the system.","authors":["Jian Xu"],"meta":["April 2021Journal of Physics Conference Series 1852(3):032005","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/1852/3/032005"],"references":[]}
