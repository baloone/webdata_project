{"id":"313650495_A_review_of_intelligent_tutoring_systems_in_e-learning","abstract":"An ITS (Intelligent Tutoring System) is a complex, integrated software system that applies the principles and methods of artificial intelligence (AI) to the problems and needs of teaching and learning. They allow searching the student level of knowledge and learning strategies used to increase or correct the students' knowledge. They are intended to support and improve the teaching and learning process in a selected area of knowledge while respecting the individuality of the learner. In the paper a review of intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) is given from the aspect of their application and usability in modern learning concepts.\n\nHow to cite this article:\nDašić, P.; Dašić, J.; Crvenković, B. & Šerifi, V.: A review of intelligent tutoring systems in e-learning.
