{"id":"318375309_ecr_20_a_modular_framework_for_evolutionary_computation_in_R","abstract":"The novel R package ecr (version 2), short for Evolutionary Computation in R, provides a comprehensive collection of building blocks for constructing powerful evolutionary algorithms for single- and multi-objective continuous and combinatorial optimization problems. It allows to solve standard optimization tasks with few lines of code using a black-box approach. Moreover, rapid prototyping of non-standard ideas is possible via an explicit, white-box approach. This paper describes the design principles of the package and gives some introductory examples on how to use the package in practise.","authors":["Jakob Bossek"],"meta":["July 2017","DOI:10.1145/3067695.3082470","Conference: the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference Companion","Project: R-Package: ecr"],"references":["257428155_GA_A_Package_for_Genetic_Algorithms_in_R","248797670_The_CMA_evolution_strategy_a_tutorial","246648860_Differential_Evolution_A_Simple_and_Efficient_Adaptive_Scheme_for_Global_Optimization_Over_Continuous_Spaces","235707002_DEAP_A_Python_framework_for_Evolutionary_Algorithms","235707001_DEAP_Evolutionary_algorithms_made_easy","228975683_Evolving_frameworks_A_pattern_language_for_developing_object-oriented_frameworks","228912510_The_HeuristicLab_optimization_environment","227450960_Rcpp_Seamless_R_and_C_Integration","227050324_The_CMA_Evolution_Strategy_A_Comparing_Review","226894225_HeuristicLab_A_Generic_and_Extensible_Optimization_Environment","221024140_Evolving_Objects_A_General_Purpose_Evolutionary_Computation_Library","215992035_DEoptim_An_R_Package_for_Global_Optimization_by_Differential_Evolution","318393858_R_A_Language_and_Environment_for_Statistical_Computing","292965126_Architecture_and_Design_of_the_HeuristicLab_Optimization_Environment","281345608_Ggplot2_Elegant_Graphics_for_Data_Analysis","274015857_Team_RDCR_A_Language_And_Environment_For_Statistical_Computing_R_Foundation_for_Statistical_Computing_Vienna_Austria","246291134_Genalg-R_based_genetic_algorithm","220291960_JMetal_A_Java_framework_for_multi-objective_optimization","216756602_Large_Sample_Properties_of_Simulations_Using_Latin_Hypercube_Sampling","3418687_A_fast_and_elitist_multiobjective_genetic_algorithm_NSGA-II"]}
