{"id":"331138988_Outer-Independent_Italian_Domination_in_Graphs","abstract":"An outer-independent Italian dominating function (OIIDF) on a graph G with vertex set V (G) is defined as a function f : V (G) → {0, 1, 2} such that every vertex v∈V (G) with f(v) = 0 has at least two neighbors assigned 1 under f or one neighbor w with f(w) = 2, and the set {u∈V | f(u) = 0} is independent. The weight of an OIIDF f is the value w(f) = Σu∈V (G) f(u). The minimum weight of an OIIDF on a graph G is called the outer-independent Italian domination number ϒoiI (G) of G. In this paper, we initiate the study of the outer-independent Italian domination number and we present bounds on outer-independent Italian domination number in terms of the order, diameter and vertex cover number. In addition, we establish lower and upper bounds on ϒoiI (T) when T is a tree, and we characterize all extremal trees constructively. We also give Nordhaus-Gaddum type inequalities.","authors":["Wenjie Fan","Ansheng Ye","Fang Miao","Zehui Shao"],"meta":["February 2019IEEE Access PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2899875"],"references":["326139501_Computational_Complexity_of_Outer-Independent_Total_and_Total_Roman_Domination_Numbers_in_Trees","318601156_Weak_2-domination_number_of_Cartesian_products_of_cycles","314981753_Outer_independent_Roman_dominating_functions_in_graphs","279280594_2-Outer-Independent_Domination_in_Graphs","273329371_Bipartite_Theory_of_Graphs_Outer-Independent_Domination","251701381_A_lower_bound_on_the_total_outer-independent_domination_number_of_a_tree","309382390_Italian_domination_in_trees","286756680_Roman_2-domination","265425704_On_Complementary_Graphs","262369764_n-Domination_in_graphs"]}
