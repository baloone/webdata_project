{"id":"338992717_Functional_Dependencies_in_Incomplete_Databases_with_Limited_Domains","abstract":"Missing data value is an extensive problem in both research and industrial developers. Two general approaches are there to deal with the problem of missing values in databases, they either could be ignored (removed) or imputed (filled in) with new values [9]. In the present paper, we use the second method. Possible worlds were introduced in [14, 16] and possible and certain keys, as well as weak and strong functional dependencies were studied. We introduced the intermediate concept of strongly possible worlds that are obtained by imputing values already existing in the table in a preceding paper. This results in strongly possible keys and strongly possible functional dependencies. We give a polynomial algorithm to verify a single spKey, and show that in general, it is NP-complete to verify an arbitrary collection of spKeys. We give a graph theoretical characterization of the validity of a given spFD . We analyze which weak/strong functional dependency axioms remain sound for strongly possible functional dependencies and give appropriate modifications of the not sound ones.","authors":["Munqath Alattar","Attila Sali"],"meta":["January 2020","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-39951-1_1","In book: Foundations of Information and Knowledge Systems, 11th International Symposium, FoIKS 2020, Dortmund, Germany, February 17â€“21, 2020, Proceedings (pp.1-21)","Project: Incomplete Databases"],"references":["303848496_Possible_and_certain_keys_for_SQL","250806217_Experimental_analysis_of_methods_for_imputation_of_missing_values_in_databases","226731770_The_Treatment_of_Missing_Values_and_its_Effect_on_Classifier_Accuracy","221309622_Functional_Dependencies_and_Incomplete_Information","335896591_Embedded_functional_dependencies_and_data-completeness_tailored_database_design","335435092_Keys_in_Relational_Databases_with_Nulls_and_Bounded_Domains","324512144_SQL_Schema_Design_Foundations_Normal_Forms_and_Normalization","308732916_Imputing_missing_values_using_Inverse_Distance_Weighted_Interpolation_for_time_series_data","305263241_Incomplete_information_and_dependencies_in_relational_databases","303051451_A_comparison_of_several_approches_to_missing_attribute_values_in_data_mining","261041289_Comparison_of_missing_data_imputation_methods_for_traffic_flow","222543848_Impact_of_imputation_of_missing_values_on_classification_error_for_discrete_data","222506513_Axiomatisation_of_functional_dependencies_in_incomplete_relations","221310266_Dependency_Satisfaction_in_Databases_with_Incomplete_Information","220509291_A_Novel_Framework_for_Imputation_of_Missing_Values_in_Databases","220432097_On_the_Equivalence_of_Database_Models","220430945_Lipski_W_Incomplete_information_in_relational_databases_JACM_314_761-791","220112721_Functional_Dependencies_in_Relations_with_Null_Values","220073016_Missing_Is_Useful'_Missing_Values_in_Cost-Sensitive_Decision_Trees","4310216_Improving_Relational_Database_Quality_Based_on_Adaptive_Learning_Method_for_Estimating_Null_Value","3412667_A_novel_framework_for_imputation_of_missing_values_in_databases_IEEE_Trans_Syst_Man_Cybern_Part_A_Syst_Humans"]}
