{"id":"257554670_Z2Z4_-linear_codes_Generator_matrices_and_duality","abstract":"A code \n\n${{\\mathcal C}}$\nis \n\n${{{\\mathbb Z}_2}{{\\mathbb Z}_4}}$\n-additive if the set of coordinates can be partitioned into two subsets X and Y such that the punctured code of \n\n${{\\mathcal C}}$\nby deleting the coordinates outside X (respectively, Y) is a binary linear code (respectively, a quaternary linear code). In this paper \n\n${{{\\mathbb Z}_2}{{\\mathbb Z}_4}}$\n-additive codes are studied. Their corresponding binary images, via the Gray map, are \n\n${{{\\mathbb Z}_2}{{\\mathbb Z}_4}}$\n-linear codes, which seem to be a very distinguished class of binary group codes. As for binary and quaternary linear codes, for these codes the fundamental parameters are found and standard forms for generator and parity-check matrices are given. In order to do this, the appropriate concept of duality for \n\n${{{\\mathbb Z}_2}{{\\mathbb Z}_4}}$\n-additive codes is defined and the parameters of their dual codes are computed.","authors":["Joaquim Borges","Cristina Fernández-Córdoba","Jaume Pujol","Josep Rifa"],"meta":["February 2010Designs Codes and Cryptography 54(2)","DOI:10.1007/s10623-009-9316-9","SourceDBLP"],"references":["251109395_Construction_of_Z2Z4Linear_Reed-Muller_Codes","268974567_The_Association_Schemes_of_Coding_Theory","268533745_Introduction_to_Coding_Theory","267478927_On_Z_2_Z_4_-linear_codes_and_duality","265373520_Group_Partitions_and_Mixed_Perfect_Codes","265356186_An_algebraic_approach_to_association_schemes_and_coding_theory","258239683_The_theory_of_error-correcting_codes_Parts_I_II","251148604_Every_Z2k-Code_is_a_Binary_Propelinear_Code","247963718_The_rank_and_the_kernel_of_1-perfect_additive_codes_and_extended_1-perfect_Z4-linear_codes","246526499_Introduction_to_Group_Characters"]}
