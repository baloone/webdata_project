{"id":"356904276_Factors_Affecting_to_the_Success_of_Computerized_Maintenance_Management_System_in_Multinational_Beer_Companies","abstract":"A computerized maintenance management system or CMMS is software that centralizes maintenance information and facilitates the processes of maintenance operations. It helps optimize the utilization and availability of physical equipment like vehicles, machinery, communications, plant infrastructures and other assets. CMMS is essential because they make it easier and more efficient for maintenance managers and departments to meet their primary objective: reliable uptime. The purpose of the study was to identify the factors affecting to the success of CMMS in multinational beer companies. A quantitative study was performed and structural modelling was used to analyze data with the aid of SmartPLS software. Results suggested that the Data standard, role assignment and Continues improvement are significant predictors of successful CMMS and findings contribute to the existing literature on computer science. Further managerial implications are encouraged for better implementation of CMMS.","authors":["N V Gunathilaka","Niranjala Tennakoon","Janani Lasanthika"],"meta":["November 2021Sabaragamuwa University Journal 1(1):1-21","Project: Research of the MBA"],"references":["330881323_Using_Partial_Least_Squares_to_Measure_Tourism_Students'_Satisfaction_with_Work-Integrated_Learning","310733950_Factors_Influencing_the_Success_of_ERP_System_Implementation_in_the_Public_Sector_in_the_Kingdom_of_Bahrain","299371184_The_Computerized_Maintenance_Management_System_an_Essential_Tool_for_World_Class_Maintenance","270262067_Business_Process_Modelling_as_a_Critical_Success_Factor_in_Implementing_an_ERP_System","244484470_Review_Paper_Critical_Success_Factors_for_ERP_Implementation","241711633_Success_and_Failure_Factors_of_Adopting_SAP_in_ERP_System_Installation","284201575_Introduction_to_Multi-_and_Megavariate_Data_Analysis_Using_Projection_Methods_PCA_PLS","222752779_Implementation_and_benefits_of_introducing_a_computerised_maintenance_management_system_into_a_textile_manufacturing_company","2930768_Critical_Success_Factors_of_Enterprise_Resource"]}
