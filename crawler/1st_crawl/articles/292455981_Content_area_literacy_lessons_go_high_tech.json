{"id":"292455981_Content_area_literacy_lessons_go_high_tech","abstract":"This article addresses literacy and technology as integral tools within content lessons at all levels. It begins with a brief history of content reading instruction as it has developed over the past few decades. This account demonstrates the importance of content reading instruction as a means of providing teachers with tools that can help them help their students learn content material. Next, a new tool - technology - is introduced through background information and a description of its impact on content area reading instruction. Third, the article presents an instructional framework to guide teachers in planning and delivering excellent content lessons, and explains one adaptation of that framework. Technology-infused lessons that demonstrate each step of the framework are provided, along with some examples that combine all stages. Last, important factors in designing content lessons that incorporate technology are presented to provide teachers with recommendations for developing their own lessons.","authors":["J.S.
