{"id":"325536489_Construct_validity_of_Thai_lifelong_learning_inventory_Evidence_from_high-school_students_in_Phrae_Kalasin_Prachin_Buri_and_Pangnga_provinces","abstract":"This study aimed to assess the construct validity of Thai lifelong learning inventory: evidence from high-school students in Phrae, Kalasin, Prachinburi, and Pang-nga provinces. The participants in this study were 1,939 high-school students and were selected through multi-stage sampling. The tools were two sets of an inventory to determine the students of lifelong learning, each of which contained 70 items. The first set was a 5-scale Likert inventory and the second was a situational inventory with 4 choices for each item. The data were validated using second order confirmatory factor analysis followed by the LISREL 8.72. The results indicated that the models fitted to the empirical data found in the former inventory, χ² = 125.79, df = 106, p = .09, GFI = 1.00, AGFI = 0.98 and RMSEA = 0.01, and those found in the latter,χ² = 149.96, df = 127, p = .08, GFI = 0.99, AGFI = 0.98, RMSEA = 0.01.","authors":["Saksit Rittilun","Nuttaporn Lawthong","Sirichai Kanjanawasee"],"meta":["June 2018Kasetsart Journal of Social Sciences 39(2)","DOI:10.1016/j.kjss.2018.05.009"],"references":["248939211_Developing_an_Effective_Lifelong_Learning_Inventory_the_ELLI_Project","254581137_Engaging_Secondary_School_Students_In_Lifelong_Learning","249699144_A_Confirmatory_Factor_Analysis_of_the_Oddi_Continuing_Learning_Inventory_OCLI","249698953_Characteristics_of_Lifelong_Learners_in_the_Human_Service_Professions","249698766_Development_and_Validation_of_an_Instrument_to_Identify_Self-Directed_Continuing_Learners","44827903_Revisiting_lifelong_education_for_the_21st_century","44827301_Measurement_and_Evaluation_in_Education_and_Psychology","34527239_Lifelong_learning_in_organizations_microform_differentiating_factors_between_adult_employee_groups","6868931_Assessing_Physicians'_Orientation_Toward_Lifelong_Learning"]}
