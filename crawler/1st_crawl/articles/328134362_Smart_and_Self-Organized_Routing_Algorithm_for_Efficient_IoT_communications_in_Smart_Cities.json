{"id":"328134362_Smart_and_Self-Organized_Routing_Algorithm_for_Efficient_IoT_communications_in_Smart_Cities","abstract":"IoT de not stop integrating an important number of components and objects that are characterized by their complexity and heterogeneity. Such constraints make the existing routing protocols unsuitable for IoT communications in a smart cities environment. To accomplish all the expected tasks and satisfy the user services, it is important to guarantee a quality of communication that answers to the requirements of smart cities applications in terms of data and processing. This paper addresses the problem of the performance degradation of IoT communications in smart cities and proposes a new routing algorithm to improve them. The proposed algorithm is called SSRA (Smart and Self-Organized Routing Algorithm) which can select the best route for the packets. SSRA allows a self-organizing routing process according to a new situation of the network and devices parameters recently detected. When using SSRA, the communication records an improvement in performance in terms of packet delivery rate, throughput, end to end delay and overhead packets. SSRA extends also the devices lifetime by allowing fair and efficient energy consumption.","authors":["Sofiane Hamrioui","Camil Adam Mohamed Hamrioui","Jaime Lloret","Pascal Lorenz"],"meta":["October 2018IET Wireless Sensor Systems 8(6)","DOI:10.1049/iet-wss.2018.5022","Project: IoT, e-sant√©, Smart cities"],"references":["324460686_Wireless_Technologies_for_IoT_in_Smart_Cities","324269049_Analysis_of_Cross-Layer_Design_of_Quality-of-Service_Forward_Geographic_Wireless_Sensor_Network_Routing_Strategies_in_Green_Internet_of_Things","316240064_Internet-of-Things_Based_Smart_Cities_Recent_Advances_and_Challenges","316239905_Internet-of-Things_Based_Smart_Cities_Recent_Advances_and_Challenges","316239902_Internet_of_Things_Architecture_Recent_Advances_Taxonomy_Requirements_and_Open_Challenges","312435094_An_Integrated_IoT_Architecture_for_Smart_Metering","324071425_Dominating_Set_Algorithms_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_Survivability","323311811_QoS-aware_Data_Delivery_Framework_for_Safety-inspired_Multimedia_in_Integrated_Vehicular-IoT","321762446_5G-enabled_devices_and_smart-spaces_in_social-IoT_An_overview","320849122_SWARM-based_data_delivery_in_Social_Internet_of_Things"]}
