{"id":"243134315_A_1235_lower_bound_on_the_number_of_points_needed_to_draw_all_n-vertex_planar_graphs","abstract":"We study a problem of lower bounds on straight line drawings of planar graphs. We show that at least 1.235·n points in the plane are required to draw each n-vertex planar graph with edges drawn as straight line segments (for sufficiently large n). This improves the previous best bound of 1.206·n (for sufficiently large n) due to Chrobak and Karloff [Sigact News 20 (4) (1989) 83–86]. Our contribution is twofold: we improve the lower bound itself and we give a significantly simpler and more straightforward proof.","authors":["Maciej Kurowski"],"meta":["October 2004Information Processing Letters 92(2):95-98","DOI:10.1016/j.ipl.2004.06.009"],"references":["243050634_Convex_Maps","242590533_Linear_algorithms_for_convex_drawings_of_planar_graphs","234783389_Small_sets_supporting_Fary_embeddings_of_planar_graphs","220198275_Drawing_Plane_Graphs_Nicely","284660316_Embedding_planar_graphs_on_the_grid_In_Proc_1st_Annual_ACM-SIAM_Sympos_on_Discrete_Algorithms_SODA","223189465_Minimum-width_grid_drawings_of_plane_graphs","220779161_Embedding_Planar_Graphs_on_the_Grid","220555438_A_lower_bound_on_the_size_of_universal_sets_for_planar_graphs","220442375_How_to_draw_a_planar_graph_on_a_grid","220114990_A_Linear-Time_Algorithm_for_Drawing_a_Planar_Graph_on_a_Grid","30508435_Grid_Embedding_of_4-Connected_Plane_Graphs"]}
