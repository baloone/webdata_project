{"id":"339295704_Exploring_Metaphor_in_Computer_Sciences_A_Cognitive_Approach","abstract":"The present research explores the conceptual metaphors in the computer sciences within the framework of cognitive linguistics. The method of this study is descriptive and our data are from the comprehensive dictionary of computer sciences. The results of the research show that conceptual metaphors “computer is a human”, “computer programs are humans “ and “computer is a building” which are situated in our minds, have provided an appropriate ground for understanding and using the concepts of this scientific area. The mentioned conceptual metaphors are activated unconsciously and then metaphorical mapping between the source domain and the target domain is created. It is on the ground of this mapping that abstract and complex concepts are expressed and understood. The results substantiate the significant role of metaphor in creating and understanding concepts in the computer sciences area so much so that many of these concepts cannot be expressed without metaphorical language.","authors":["‫انصاریان‬ ‫شادی‬","khosrow  gholamali zade","Shoja Tafakkori"],"meta":["December 2016","DOI:10.22084/rjhll.2016.1733"],"references":["259844825_Handbook_of_Cognitive_Linguistics_and_Second_Language_Acquisition","246811607_Metaphor_A_Practical_Introduction","242567023_The_Contemporary_Theory_of_Metaphor","237127560_The_Foundations_of_Cognitive_Grammar"]}
