{"id":"309639578_Protecting_Sensitive_Warehouse_Data_through_UML_based_Modeling","abstract":"In today's competitive scenario in industries, each organization wants huge profit. A Data Warehouse is a place for storage of reservoir of data from the various organizations in the range of hundreds of gigabytes to terabytes in size. During the course of time, large volumes of data are being gathered continuously in the Data Warehouse Server for further mining operations in order to understand the latest trends and patterns in their business organizations which in turn be exploited by them for increasing their business profits. Organizations want to conceal its sensitive data from the Data Mining Server but still have the aim to obtain accurate data mining results. Privacy Preserving Data Mining is one of the important fields in the data security. This paper deals with Object Oriented Modeling of Privacy Preservation framework in which the privacy preserving technique applied at the DataWarehouseServer. Object Oriented Programming is the latest trend in the software industry due to its various features like reusability of software codes, better user interface, enhancing software security by restricting data access, cheaper production, development and maintenance costs and quicker software development. Authors have modeled the entire Privacy Preserving framework through standard UML diagrams such as use case, class diagram, sequence diagram and Activity diagram by using Rational Software Architect tool. This will facilitate the designers and developers to have a better understanding of the functionality of each and every entity associated with the system during analysis and design phase, before actual implementation. This simplifies the complexity of the entire operation and helps its implementation in a time and cost efficient manner.","authors":["Anurag","Deepak Arora","Upendra Kumar"],"meta":["August 2016","DOI:10.1145/2980258.2980316","Conference: the International Conference"],"references":["275605151_Extending_UML_for_trajectory_data_warehouses_conceptual_modelling","269673697_Comparative_Study_of_Data_Warehouse_Design_Approaches_A_Survey","267253917_Extending_Uml_for_Multidimensional_Modeling_in_Data_Warehouse","259843317_The_Technology_of_Using_a_Data_Warehouse_to_Support_Decision-Making_in_Health_Care","221269529_A_UML_Profile_for_Modeling_Data_Warehouse_Usage","220933974_Physical_modeling_of_data_warehouses_using_UML","220802681_Extending_UML_2_Activity_Diagrams_with_Business_Intelligence_Objects","220536550_A_UML_20OCL_extension_for_designing_secure_data_warehouses","220099547_An_Integrated_Conceptual_Model_for_Temporal_Data_Warehouse_Security","2955554_Designing_Data_Warehouses_with_OO_Conceptual_Models","316856997_Software_engineering_theory_and_practice","315385326_An_Integrated_Approach_to_Software_Engineering","286573696_Privacy_preserving_data_mining_techniques-survey","277207119_Unified_Modeling_Language_Reference_Manual_The_2nd_Edition","267384899_A_Privacy-Preserving_Classification_Method_Based_on_Singular_Value_Decomposition","262271543_Measures_for_ETL_processes_models_in_data_warehouses","251880387_Building_the_Data_Warehouse","246102682_The_Unified_Modeling_Language_Reference_Manual","240249302_Software_Engineering_a_Practioner''s_approach","220691727_An_Integrated_Approach_to_Software_Engineering","220610529_Object_Oriented_Data_Modeling_for_Data_Warehousing_An_Extension_of_UML_approach_to_study_Hajj_pilgrim's_private_tour_as_a_Case_Study","215863688_The_Unified_Modeling_Language_Reference_Manual","31852627_The_Unified_Modeling_Language_Reference_Manual_J_Rumbaugh_I_Jacobson_G_Booch","31663591_Software_Engineering_A_Practitioner's_Approach_RJ_Pressman","3247516_Software_Engineering_Principles"]}
