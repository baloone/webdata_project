{"id":"227625423_Perceived_Teacher_Self-Efficacy_as_a_Predictor_of_Job_Stress_and_Burnout_Mediation_Analyses","abstract":"Teacher self-efficacy is studied as a personal resource factor that may protect from the experience of job strain and, thus, make the escalation of burnout less likely. The article examines the relationships between self-efficacy, job stress, and burnout, focusing on mediation (self-efficacy job stress burnout). Moreover, it questions whether such a mediation, if found, would be dependent on the levels of other variables (moderated mediation). Study I, with two samples of teachers (N= 1,203), examined this putative mechanism cross-sectionally and found such an effect, in particular for younger teachers and those with low general self-efficacy. Study II, with 458 teachers, replicated the results longitudinally over a period of one year by employing structural equation models. In a cross-lagged panel design, low self-efficacy preceded burnout. Further research should study these mechanisms by interventions that aim at strengthening teacher self-efficacy as a protective resource factor.","authors":["Ralf Schwarzer","Suhair Hallum"],"meta":["July 2008Applied Psychology 57(s1):152 - 171","DOI:10.1111/j.1464-0597.2008.00359.x"],"references":["308017879_Helfer-Leiden_Stress_und_Burnout_in_psychosozialen_Berufen","304930542_Generalized_Self-Efficacy_Scale","277816643_The_Maslach_Burnout_Inventory_Manual","249797734_Teacher_Efficacy_Its_Meaning_and_Measure","346674803_Teacher_Burnout_from_a_Social-Cognitive_Perspective_A_Theoretical_Position_Paper","316823281_Self-efficacy_the_exercise_of_control","285831994_Self-Efficacy_The_Exercise_of_Control","260292577_Individuelle_und_kollektive_selbstwirksamkeitserwartung_von_lehrern","247496827_Teacher_Burnout_in_Hong_Kong_and_Germany_A_Cross-Cultural_Validation_of_the_Maslach_Burnout_Inventory","240723583_Occupational_Stress_Burnout_and_Health_in_Teachers_A_Methodological_and_Theoretical_Analysis"]}
