{"id":"355116646_Progresses_and_Challenges_in_Link_Prediction","abstract":"Link prediction is a paradigmatic problem in network science, which aims at estimating the existence likelihoods of nonobserved links, based on known topology. After a brief introduction of the standard problem and metrics of link prediction, this review will summarize representative progresses about local similarity indices, link predictability, network embedding, matrix completion, ensemble learning and some others, mainly extracted from related publications in the last decade. Finally, this review will outline some long-standing challenges for future studies.","authors":["Tao Zhou"],"meta":["October 2021iScience 24(11):103217","DOI:10.1016/j.isci.2021.103217"],"references":["349697005_Learning_Universal_Network_Representation_via_Link_Prediction_by_Graph_Convolutional_Neural_Network","348202506_Adaptive_Network_Automata_Modelling_of_Complex_Networks","346503542_Link_Prediction_through_Deep_Generative_Model","346439243_Missing_links_as_a_source_of_seemingly_variable_constants_in_complex_reaction_networks","353567000_Link_prediction_via_controlling_the_leading_eigenvector","351948650_Short_Note_on_Comparing_Stacking_Modelling_Versus_Cannistraci-Hebb_Adaptive_Network_Automata_for_Link_Prediction_in_Complex_Networks","351800418_Collaborative_filtering_approach_to_link_prediction","349330273_Towards_link_inference_attack_against_network_structure_perturbation","347308455_Experimental_analyses_on_2-hop-based_and_3-hop-based_link_prediction_algorithms","347083562_Benchmarking_Network_Embedding_Models_for_Link_Prediction_Are_We_Making_Progress"]}
