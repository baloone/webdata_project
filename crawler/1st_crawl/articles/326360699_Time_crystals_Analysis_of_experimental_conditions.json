{"id":"326360699_Time_crystals_Analysis_of_experimental_conditions","abstract":"Time crystals are quantum many-body systems which are able to self-organize their motion in a periodic way in time. Discrete time crystals have been experimentally demonstrated in spin systems. However, the first idea of spontaneous breaking of discrete time translation symmetry, in ultracold atoms bouncing on an oscillating mirror, still awaits experimental demonstration. Here, we perform a detailed analysis of the experimental conditions needed for the realization of such a discrete time crystal. Importantly, the considered system allows for the realization of dramatic breaking of discrete time translation symmetry where a symmetry broken state evolves with a period tens of times longer than the driving period. Moreover, atoms bouncing on an oscillating mirror constitute a suitable system for the realization of dynamical quantum phase transitions in discrete time crystals and for the demonstration of various nontrivial condensed-matter phenomena in the time domain. We show that Anderson localization effects, which are typically associated with spatial disorder and exponential localization of eigenstates of a particle in configuration space, can be observed in the time domain when ultracold atoms are bouncing on a randomly moving mirror.","authors":["Krzysztof Giergiel","Arkadiusz Kosior","P.
