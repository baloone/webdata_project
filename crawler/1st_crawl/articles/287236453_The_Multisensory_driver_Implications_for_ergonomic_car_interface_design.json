{"id":"287236453_The_Multisensory_driver_Implications_for_ergonomic_car_interface_design","abstract":"This book is dedicated to furthering the design of ergonomic multisensory interfaces by highlighting recent evidence in this area emerging from the fast-growing field of cognitive neuroscience. It focuses primarily on two aspects of driver information-processing: multisensory interactions and the spatial distribution of attention in driving.","authors":["C.
