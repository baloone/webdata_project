{"id":"283741166_Intelligent_Dynamic_Aging_Approaches_in_Web_Proxy_Cache_Replacement","abstract":"One of commonly used approach to enhance the Web performance is Web proxy caching technique. In Web proxy caching, Least-Frequently-Used-Dynamic-Aging (LFU-DA) is one of the common proxy cache replacement methods, which is widely used in Web proxy cache management. LFU-DA accomplishes a superior byte hit ratio compared to other Web proxy cache replacement algorithms. However, LFU-DA may suffer in hit ratio measure. Therefore, in this paper, LFU-DA is enhanced using popular supervised machine learning techniques such as a support vector machine (SVM), a na√Øve Bayes classifier (NB) and a decision tree (C4.5). SVM, NB and C4.5 are trained from Web proxy logs files and then intelligently incorporated with LFU-DA to form Intelligent Dynamic-Aging (DA) approaches. The simulation results revealed that the proposed intelligent Dynamic-Aging approaches considerably improved the performances in terms of hit and byte hit ratio of the conventional LFU-DA on a range of real datasets.","authors":["Waleed Ali","Siti Mariyam Shamsuddin"],"meta":["January 2015Journal of Intelligent Learning Systems and Applications 07(04):117-127","DOI:10.4236/jilsa.2015.74011"],"references":["296791622_Evaluating_content_management_techniques_for_Web_proxy_caches","274640609_Intelligent_Cooperative_Least_Recently_Used_Web_Caching_Policy_based_on_J48_Classifier","265986051_A_Survey_of_Web_Caching_and_Prefetching_A_Survey_of_Web_Caching_and_Prefetching","307881957_LIBSVM_A_library_for_support_vector_machines","298126158_Performance_evaluation_of_web_proxy_cache_replacement_policies","288023219_A_Practical_Guide_to_Support_Vector_Classification","286127445_Performance_improvement_of_least-recently-used_policy_in_web_proxy_cache_replacement_using_supervised_machine_learning","262565566_The_Top_Ten_Algorithms_in_Data_Mining","258188092_A_Quantitative_Study_of_Web_Cache_Replacement_Strategies_Using_Simulation","228715647_LIBSVM_A_library_for_support_vector_machines"]}
