{"id":"317868752_Comparing_Conventional_and_Augmented_Reality_Instructions_for_Manual_Assembly_Tasks","abstract":"Augmented Reality (AR) gains increased attention as a means to provide assistance for different human activities. Hereby the suitability of AR does not only depend on the respective task, but also to a high degree on the respective device. In a standardized assembly task, we tested AR-based in-situ assistance against conventional pictorial instructions using a smartphone, Microsoft HoloLens and Epson Moverio BT-200 smart glasses as well as paper-based instructions. Participants solved the task fastest using the paper instructions, but made less errors with AR assistance on the Microsoft HoloLens smart glasses than with any other system. Methodically we propose operational definitions of time segments and other optimizations for standardized benchmarking of AR assembly instructions.","authors":["Jonas Blattgerste","Benjamin Strenge","Patrick Renner","Thies Pfeiffer"],"meta":["June 2017","DOI:10.1145/3056540.3056547","Conference: the 10th International Conference","Project: Mixed Reality Performance Assistance"],"references":["310822694_Mobile_In-Situ_Pick-by-Vision_Order_Picking_Support_using_a_Projector_Helmet","310820161_Interactive_worker_assistance_comparing_the_effects_of_in-situ_projection_head-mounted_displays_tablet_and_paper_instructions","308504379_Using_In-Situ_Projection_to_Support_Cognitively_Impaired_Workers_at_the_Workplace","308416722_A_benchmark_for_interactive_augmented_reality_instructions_for_assembly_tasks","303803052_Augmented_reality_an_application_of_heads-up_display_technology_to_manual_manufacturing_processes","283672001_Developing_a_Mixed_Reality_Assistance_System_Based_on_Projection_Mapping_Technology_for_Manual_Operations_at_Assembly_Workstations","221519088_Comparative_effectiveness_of_augmented_reality_in_object_assembly","3510119_Augmented_reality_An_application_of_heads-up_display_technology_to_manual_manufacturing_processes","315852073_Attention_guiding_techniques_using_peripheral_vision_and_eye_tracking_for_feedback_in_augmented-reality-based_assistance_systems","304055186_smARtAssembly_-_Projection-Based_Augmented_Reality_for_Supporting_Assembly_Workers","271452953_The_effectiveness_of_an_AR-based_context-aware_assembly_support_system_in_object_assembly","262332398_Integrating_the_physical_environment_into_mobile_remote_collaboration","250002765_Real-time_Modeling_and_Tracking_Manual_Workflows_from_First-Person_Vision","235705634_Nasa-task_load_index_Nasa-TLX_20_years_later","221221331_Supporting_order_picking_with_Augmented_Reality","221221152_Evaluating_the_Benefits_of_Augmented_Reality_for_Task_Localization_in_Maintenance_of_an_Armored_Personnel_Carrier_Turret"]}
