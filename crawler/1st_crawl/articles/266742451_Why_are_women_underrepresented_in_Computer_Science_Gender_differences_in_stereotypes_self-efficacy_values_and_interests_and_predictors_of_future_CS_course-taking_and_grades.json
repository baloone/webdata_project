Data from 1319 American first-year college students (872 female and 447 male) indicate that gender differences in computer self-efficacy, stereotypes, interests, values, interpersonal orientation, and personality exist. If students had had a positive experience in their first CS course, they had a stronger intention to take another CS course. A subset of 128 students (68 females and 60 males) took a CS course up to one year later. Students who were interested in CS, had high computer self-efficacy, were low in family orientation, low in conscientiousness, and low in openness to experiences were more likely to take CS courses. Furthermore, individuals who were highly conscientious and low in relational-interdependent self-construal earned the highest CS grades. Efforts to improve womenâ€™s representation in CS should bear these results in mind.","authors":["Sylvia Beyer"],"meta":["July 2014Computer Science Education 24(2-3)","DOI:10.1080/08993408.2014.963363"],"references":["327618758_Pradikatoren_des_Selbstvertrauens_von_Madchen_und_Jungen_vor_dem_erstmaligen_Chemieunterricht_am_Gymnasium","325671628_How_Chronic_Self-views_Influence_and_Potentially_Mislead_Estimates_of_Performance","314676692_Personality_Characteristics_of_Established_IT_Professionals_I","314420955_Earnings_of_Women_with_Computer_Sciences_or_Engineering_College_Majors","314410683_A_Faculty_Role_in_Women's_Participating_in_Computing","314218414_Defensive_climate_in_the_computer_science_classroom","312901805_Linking_gender_to_educational_occupational_and_recreational_choices_Applying_the_Eccles_et_al_model_of_achievement-related_choices_In_W_B_Swann_J_H_Langlois_L_A_Gilbert_Eds_Sexism_and_stereotypes_in_m","298971004_Factors_that_influence_persistence_in_science_and_engineering_career_aspirations","297140315_Why_IS_Understanding_undergraduate_students'_intentions_to_choose_an_information_systems_major","293312640_Creating_academic_career_opportunities_for_women_in_science_Lessons_from_liberal_arts_colleges"]}
