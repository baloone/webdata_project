{"id":"307583744_The_Traveling_Purchaser_Problem_and_its_Variants","abstract":"The Traveling Purchaser Problem (TPP) has been one of the most studied generalizations of the Traveling\nSalesman Problem. Thanks to its double nature of procurement and transportation problem, the\nTPP has attracted the attention of both researchers in combinatorial optimization and practitioners\nin recent decades. The problem has been used to model several application contexts and is computationally\nchallenging, dealing at the same time with the suppliers selection, the optimization of the\npurchasing plan and the routing decisions of the purchaser. We survey, for the first time after 50 years\nfrom its birth, all the research done on the TPP including the most interesting and best performing\nsolution methods proposed so far. We conclude providing some interesting future developments.","authors":["Daniele Manerba","Renata Mansini","Jorge Riera-Ledesma"],"meta":["May 2017European Journal of Operational Research 259(1):1-18","DOI:10.1016/j.ejor.2016.12.017","Project: The Traveling Purchaser Problem (TPP) and its variants"],"references":["306072750_The_Nurse_Routing_Problem_with_Workload_Constraints_and_Incompatible_Services","283073255_Good_Laboratory_Practice_for_Optimization_Research","280077325_Optimal_placement_of_sequentially_ordered_virtual_security_appliances_in_the_cloud","279976567_A_Stochastic_Programming_Approach_for_the_Traveling_Purchaser_Problem","312106719_The_Traveling_Purchaser_Problem_with_time-dependent_quantities","305395554_The_truck_despatching_problem","304890422_Erratum_The_Traveling_Salesman_Problem_A_Guided_Tour_of_Combinatorial_Optimization","304756734_Job_Scheduling","290244008_The_Stochastic_and_Dynamic_Traveling_Purchaser_Problem","287661759_An_effective_heuristic_algorithm_for_the_traveling_salesman_problem"]}
