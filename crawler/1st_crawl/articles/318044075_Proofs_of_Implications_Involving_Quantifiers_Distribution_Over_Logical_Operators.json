{"id":"318044075_Proofs_of_Implications_Involving_Quantifiers_Distribution_Over_Logical_Operators","abstract":"Mathematics is considered the base for computer science. In particular, discrete mathematics is commonly\nused in many disciplines of computer science. One of the main topics that are discussed in discrete\nmathematics is quantifiers and their relations with logical operators. Accordingly, this paper proposes a new\nmethod to prove the validity of some implications involving quantifiers and logical operators. The proposed\nmethod is based on the idea of showing that whenever the premise of the implication is true, the conclusion\ncannot be false (must be true), so the implication is valid. On the other hand, if the conclusion can be false\nthen the implication is not valid.","authors":["Maher Nabulsi","Nesreen A.
