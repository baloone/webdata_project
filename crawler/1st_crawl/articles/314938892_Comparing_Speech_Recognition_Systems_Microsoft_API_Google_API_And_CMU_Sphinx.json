{"id":"314938892_Comparing_Speech_Recognition_Systems_Microsoft_API_Google_API_And_CMU_Sphinx","abstract":"The idea of this paper is to design a tool that will be used to test and compare commercial speech recognition systems, such as Microsoft Speech API and Google Speech API, with open-source speech recognition systems such as Sphinx-4. The best way to compare automatic speech recognition systems in different environments is by using some audio recordings that were selected from different sources and calculating the word error rate (WER). Although the WER of the three aforementioned systems were acceptable, it was observed that the Google API is superior.","authors":["Gamal Bohouta","Veton Z KÃ«puska"],"meta":["March 2017International Journal of Engineering Research and Applications 2248-9622(3):20-24","DOI:10.9790/9622-0703022024","Project: Comparing Speech Recognition Systems (Microsoft API, Google  API And CMU Sphinx) using Java and C# language"],"references":["293807031_Wake-Up-Word_Speech_Recognition","228770826_Sphinx-4_A_flexible_open_source_framework_for_speech_recognition"]}
