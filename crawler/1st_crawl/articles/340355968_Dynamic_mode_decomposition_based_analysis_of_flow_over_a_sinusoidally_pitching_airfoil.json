{"id":"340355968_Dynamic_mode_decomposition_based_analysis_of_flow_over_a_sinusoidally_pitching_airfoil","abstract":"Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) has proven to be a valuable tool for the analysis of complex flow-fields but the application of this technique to flows with moving boundaries is not straightforward. This is due to the difficulty in accounting in the DMD formulation, for a body of non-zero thickness moving through the field of interest. This work presents a method for decomposing the flow on or near a moving boundary by a change of reference frame, followed by a correction to the computed modes that is determined by the frequency spectrum of the motion. The correction serves to recover the modes of the underlying flow dynamics, while removing the effect of change in reference frame. This method is applied to flow over sinusoidally pitching airfoils, and the DMD analysis is used to derive useful insights regarding flow-induced pitch oscillations of these airfoils.","authors":["Karthik Menon","Rajat Mittal"],"meta":["April 2020Journal of Fluids and Structures 94(2):102886","DOI:10.1016/j.jfluidstructs.2020.102886"],"references":["320944297_Modal_decomposition_of_fluid-structure_interaction_with_application_to_flag_flapping","313538520_Analysis_of_Airfoil_Stall_Control_Using_Dynamic_Mode_Decomposition","313395249_Modal_Analysis_of_Fluid_Flows_An_Overview","310657868_Lock-in_in_forced_vibration_of_a_circular_cylinder","303598828_Compressed_sensing_and_dynamic_mode_decomposition","298334831_Vortex_formation_and_shedding_from_a_cyber-physical_pitching_plate","292950711_Model_Reduction_and_Analysis_of_Deep_Dynamic_Stall_on_a_Plunging_Airfoil","335434020_Flow_physics_and_dynamics_of_flow-induced_pitch_oscillations_of_an_airfoil","327048680_Leading-Edge_Vortices_Mechanics_and_Modeling","309727542_Dynamic_Mode_Decomposition_Data-Driven_Modeling_of_Complex_Systems"]}
