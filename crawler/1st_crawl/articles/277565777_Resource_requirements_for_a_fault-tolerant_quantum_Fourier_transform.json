{"id":"277565777_Resource_requirements_for_a_fault-tolerant_quantum_Fourier_transform","abstract":"We investigate resource requirements for a fault-tolerant quantum Fourier transform. The quantum Fourier transform is a basic subroutine for quantum algorithms which provide an exponential speedup over known classical ones, such as Shor's algorithm for factoring. To implement single-qubit rotations required for a quantum Fourier transform in a fault-tolerant manner, we consider two types of approaches: gate synthesis and state distillation. While the gate synthesis approximates single-qubit rotations with basic quantum operations, the state distillation allows one to perform single-qubit rotations for a quantum Fourier transform exactly. It is unknown, however, which approach is better for a quantum Fourier transform. Here we develop a state-distillation method optimized for a quantum Fourier transform and compare this performance with those of state-of-the-art techniques for gate synthesis without and with ancillary states (ancillas). The performance is evaluated with the resource requirement for a quantum Fourier transform. The resource is measured by the total number of $$\\pi${}/8$ gates denoted by $T$, which is called the $T$ count. Contrary to the expectation, the $T$ count for the state distillation is considerably larger than those for the ancilla-free and ancilla-assisted gate synthesis. Thus, we conclude that the ancilla-assisted gate synthesis is a better approach to a fault-tolerant quantum Fourier transform.","authors":["Hayato Goto"],"meta":["November 2014Physical review A, Atomic, molecular, and optical physics 90(5)","DOI:10.1103/PhysRevA.90.052318"],"references":["258085144_Quantum_Algorithm_for_Data_Fitting","236887201_Floating_Point_Representations_in_Quantum_Circuit_Synthesis","235784926_Efficient_Decomposition_of_Single-Qubit_Gates_into_V_Basis_Circuits","233815863_Exact_synthesis_of_multi-qubit_CliffordT_circuits","232238074_Multilevel_distillation_of_magic_states_for_quantum_computing","221852549_An_Efficient_Exact_Quantum_Algorithm_for_the_Integer_Square-free_Decomposition_Problem","220420133_Recent_Progress_in_Quantum_Algorithms","51947855_Adiabatic_Quantum_Algorithm_for_Search_Engine_Ranking","23552588_Quantum_Algorithms_for_Algebraic_Problems","12020333_A_Quantum_Adiabatic_Evolution_Algorithm_Applied_to_Random_Instances_of_an_NP-Complete_Problem","7611126_Simulated_Quantum_Computation_of_Molecular_Energies","2201458_Approximate_Quantum_Fourier_Transform_and","2194289_Constructing_arbitrary_Steane_code_single_logical_qubit_fault-tolerantgates","280821144_Polynomial-Time_Algorithms_for_Prime_Factorization_and_Discrete_Logarithms_on_a_Quantum_Computer","258780734_Distillation_of_nonstabilizer_states_for_universal_quantum_computation","258247804_Repeat-Until-Success_Non-deterministic_decomposition_of_single-qubit_unitaries","257982237_Optimization_of_the_Solovay-Kitaev_algorithm","236936881_Asymptotically_Optimal_Approximation_of_Single_Qubit_Unitaries_by_Clifford_and_T_Circuits_Using_a_Constant_Number_of_Ancillary_Qubits","233947256_Novel_constructions_for_the_fault-tolerant_Toffoli_gate","233947065_Distilling_one-qubit_magic_states_into_Toffoli_states","233873556_Resource-Optimal_Single-Qubit_Quantum_Circuits","233786115_Magic_state_distillation_with_low_overhead","227859922_Fast_and_efficient_exact_synthesis_of_single_qubit_unitaries_generatedby_Clifford_and_T_gates","224709472_Magic-state_distillation_with_the_four-qubit_code","43454427_The_Solovay-Kitaev_algorithm","38082160_Quantum_Algorithm_for_Linear_Systems_of_Equations","7990347_Quantum_computing_with_realistically_noisy_devices","2201372_Semiclassical_Fourier_Transform_for_Quantum_Computation","2192340_Universal_quantum_computation_with_ideal_Clifford_gates_and_noisy_ancillas"]}
