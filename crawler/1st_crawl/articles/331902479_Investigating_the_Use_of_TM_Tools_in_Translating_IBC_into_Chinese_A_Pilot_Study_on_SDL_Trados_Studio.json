{"id":"331902479_Investigating_the_Use_of_TM_Tools_in_Translating_IBC_into_Chinese_A_Pilot_Study_on_SDL_Trados_Studio","abstract":"Being one of the most widely used software applications in the localisation of digital information, translation memory (hereinafter referred to as \"TM\"), along with other translation technologies constitutes a new yet important field of interdisciplinary study between computer science and translation. By assessing the application of TM in the subdomain of Civil Engineering in scientific translation, this pilot study sheds light on the strengths and shortcomings of TM and suggests possible areas for further research.","authors":["Hao Wu"],"meta":["March 2019Journal of Physics Conference Series 1176:042084","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/1176/4/042084"],"references":["275039368_Measuring_Consistency_in_Translation_Memories_A_Mixed-Methods_Case_Study","275031798_Consistency_in_Translation_Memory_Corpora_A_Mixed-Methods_Case_Study","258831627_Terminology_finding_parallel_corpora_and_bilingual_word_sketches_in_the_Sketch_Engine","39730149_The_Moving_Text_Localization_Translation_and_Distribution","345997550_The_Moving_Text_Localization_translation_and_distribution","271179357_Linguistic_Data_Banks_and_the_Technical_Translator","254290621_Metrics_for_Evaluating_Translation_Memory_Software","232829265_Translators_and_translation_technology_The_dance_of_agency","220419052_The_Origins_of_the_Translator's_Workstation"]}
