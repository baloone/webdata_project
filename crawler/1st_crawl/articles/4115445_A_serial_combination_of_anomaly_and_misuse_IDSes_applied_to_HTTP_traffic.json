{"id":"4115445_A_serial_combination_of_anomaly_and_misuse_IDSes_applied_to_HTTP_traffic","abstract":"Combining an \"anomaly\" and a \"misuse\" IDSes offers the advantage of separating the monitored events between normal, intrusive or unqualified classes (i.e. not known as an attack, but not recognize as safe either). In this article, we provide a framework to systematically reason about the combination of anomaly and misuse components. This framework applied to Web servers lead us to propose a serial architecture, using a drastic anomaly component with a sensitive misuse component. This architecture provides the operator with better qualification of the detection results, raises lower amount of false alarms and unqualified events.","authors":["Elvis Tombini","Hervé Debar","Ludovic Mé","Mireille Ducasse"],"meta":["January 2005","DOI:10.1109/CSAC.2004.4","SourceIEEE Xplore","Conference: Computer Security Applications Conference, 2004. 20th Annual"],"references":["246949230_Next-generation_Intrusion_Detection_Expert_System_NIDES_A_Summary","220710728_DIDAFIT_Detecting_Intrusions_in_Databases_Through_Fingerprinting_Transactions","220270785_An_Improved_Reference_Flow_Control_Model_for_Policy-Based_Intrusion_Detection","3497439_A_prototype_real-time_intrusion-detection_expert_system","2626135_Intrusion_Detection_Using_Sequences_of_System_Calls","221632066_Learning_Fingerprints_for_a_Database_Intrusion_Detection_System","221427608_Experiences_with_Specification-Based_Intrusion_Detection","220713513_An_Intrusion-Detection_Model","220069766_An_Intrusion-Detection_Model","4049425_A_Stateful_Intrusion_Detection_System_for_World-Wide_Web_Servers"]}
