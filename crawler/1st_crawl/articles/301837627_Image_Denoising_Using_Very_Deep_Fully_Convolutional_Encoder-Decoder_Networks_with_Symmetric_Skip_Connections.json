{"id":"301837627_Image_Denoising_Using_Very_Deep_Fully_Convolutional_Encoder-Decoder_Networks_with_Symmetric_Skip_Connections","abstract":"Image denoising is a long-standing problem in computer vision and image processing, as well as a test bed for low-level image modeling algorithms. In this paper, we propose a very deep encoding-decoding framework for image denoising. Instead of using image priors, the proposed framework learns end-to-end fully convolutional mappings from noisy images to the clean ones. The network is composed of multiple layers of convolution and de-convolution operators. With the observation that deeper networks improve denoising performance, we propose to use significantly deeper networks than those employed previously for low-level image processing tasks such as denoising. We propose to symmetrically link convolutional and de-convolutional layers with skip-layer connections, with which the training converges much faster and attains a higher-quality local optimum. From the image processing point of view, those symmetric connections help preserve image details.","authors":["Xiao-Jiao Mao","Chunhua Shen","Yu-Bin Yang"],"meta":["March 2016"],"references":["303137904_Greedy_layer-wise_training_of_deep_networks","270454670_Image_Super-Resolution_Using_Deep_Convolutional_Networks","264979485_Caffe_Convolutional_Architecture_for_Fast_Feature_Embedding","264856243_Image_Denoising_and_Inpainting_with_Deep_Neural_Networks","244418126_An_Iterative_Regularization_Method_for_Total_Variation-Based_Image_Restoration","222469583_Nonlinear_total_variation_based_noise_removal_algorithms","221620211_Natural_Image_Denoising_with_Convolutional_Networks","221346269_Extracting_and_composing_robust_features_with_denoising_autoencoders","200744514_Greedy_layer-wise_training_of_deep_networks","6151802_Image_Denoising_by_Sparse_3-D_Transform-Domain_Collaborative_Filtering","5606886_Image_denoising_using_scale_mixture_of_Gaussians_in_the_Wavelet_domain","5606814_Wavelet-based_Texture_Retrieval_using_Generalized_Gaussian_Density_and_Kullback-Leibler_Distance","3319912_K-SVD_An_Algorithm_for_Designing_Overcomplete_Dictionaries_for_Sparse_Representation","319770168_Fully_Convolutional_Networks_for_Semantic_Segmentation","310752071_Natural_image_denoising_with_convolutional_networks","308810097_Image_denoising_via_adaptive_soft-thresholding_based_on_non-local_samples","304409752_External_Patch_Prior_Guided_Internal_Clustering_for_Image_Denoising","301921832_Fully_convolutional_networks_for_semantic_segmentation","288927245_An_iterative_regularization_method_for_total_variation-based_image_restoration","286734007_Weighted_Nuclear_Norm_Minimization_with_Application_to_Image_Denoising","286512696_Deep_Residual_Learning_for_Image_Recognition","284028271_Patch_Group_Based_Nonlocal_Self-Similarity_Prior_Learning_for_Image_Denoising","280329704_Training_Very_Deep_Networks","278733906_Decoupled_Deep_Neural_Network_for_Semi-supervised_Semantic_Segmentation","276923091_Learning_Deconvolution_Network_for_Semantic_Segmentation","269935079_Adam_A_Method_for_Stochastic_Optimization","265385906_Very_Deep_Convolutional_Networks_for_Large-Scale_Image_Recognition","261399044_Image_denoising_Can_plain_neural_networks_compete_with_BM3D","233995491_Nonlocally_Centralized_Sparse_Representation_for_Image_Restoration","221110365_From_Learning_Models_of_Natural_Image_Patches_to_Whole_Image_Restoration","24432631_Clustering-Based_Denoising_With_Locally_Learned_Dictionaries","6645277_Image_Denoising_Via_Sparse_and_Redundant_Representations_Over_Learned_Dictionaries","3906161_A_Database_of_Human_Segmented_Natural_Images_and_its_Application_to_Evaluating_Segmentation_Algorithms_and_Measuring_Ecological_Statistics","3766290_Bilateral_Filtering_for_Gray_and_Color_Images","3078727_De-Noising_by_Soft-Thresholding"]}
