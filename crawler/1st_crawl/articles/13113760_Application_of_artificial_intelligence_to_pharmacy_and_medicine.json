{"id":"13113760_Application_of_artificial_intelligence_to_pharmacy_and_medicine","abstract":"Artificial intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science dealing with solving problems using symbolic programming. It has evolved into a problem solving science with applications in business, engineering, and health care. One application of AI is expert system development. An expert system consists of a knowledge base and inference engine, coupled with a user interface. A crucial aspect of expert system development is knowledge acquisition and implementing computable ways to solve problems. There have been several expert systems developed in medicine to assist physicians with medical diagnosis. Recently, several programs focusing on drug therapy have been described. They provide guidance on drug interactions, drug therapy monitoring, and drug formulary selection. There are many aspects of pharmacy that AI can have an impact on and the reader is challenged to consider these possibilities because they may some day become a reality in pharmacy.","authors":["J F Dasta"],"meta":["May 1992Hospital Pharmacy 27(4):312-5, 319-22","SourcePubMed"],"references":[]}
