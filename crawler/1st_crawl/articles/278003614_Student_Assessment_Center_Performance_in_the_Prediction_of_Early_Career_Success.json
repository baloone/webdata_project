{"id":"278003614_Student_Assessment_Center_Performance_in_the_Prediction_of_Early_Career_Success","abstract":"Our primary purpose in this study was to evaluate the criterion-related validity of an academic-based assessment center (AC), specifically in relation to early career progress. A total of 66 undergraduate business students participated in a day-long AC. The AC included a combination of in-basket, leaderless group discussion, case, interview simulation, and oral presentation exercises, as well as paper-and-pencil measures including Big Five personality variables. Assessment was performed using three trained assessors for each assessee. These assessees also participated in a follow-up survey, typically between 2 and 31/2 years following AC participation. We designed the survey to measure early career progress in the form of job satisfaction, number of promotions, and current salary. Analyses revealed that student grade point average (GPA) was generally not a good predictor of early career progress, with the exception of salary. In contrast, AC performance was most consistently predictive of both intrinsic and extrinsic aspects of career success, even after controlling for personality and GPA. Results are discussed in terms of their relevance to academically based assessment centers and the career success literature. Implications are drawn regarding the challenges and opportunities associated with the use of AC methodology in business schools.","authors":["David Waldman","Theresa Korbar"],"meta":["June 2004Academy of Management Learning and Education, The 3(2)","DOI:10.5465/AMLE.2004.13500529"],"references":["274753187_Can_Leadership_Be_Taught_Perspectives_From_Management_Educators","247406234_Comparative_Effects_of_Personal_and_Situational_Influences_on_Job_Outcomes_of_New_Professionals","232510080_Job_Experience_Correlates_of_Job_Performance","37149543_An_Empirical_Investigation_of_the_Predictors_of_Executive_Career_Success","14098123_The_Five_Factor_Model_of_Personality_an_Job_Performance_in_the_European_Community","297222207_DEVELOPING_MANAGERIAL_TALENT_THROUGH_SIMULATION","287363172_CONSTRUCTS_AND_ASSESSMENT-CENTER_DIMENSIONS_-_SOME_TROUBLING_EMPIRICAL-FINDINGS","278839647_The_dynamics_of_assessment_center_validity_Results_of_a_7-year_study","277440899_Individual_Exploration_to_Organizational_Commitment_or_Withdrawal","271565749_Performance_and_Satisfaction_in_an_Industrial_Sales_Force_An_Examination_of_Their_Antecedents_and_Simultaneity","249669617_Using_Educational_Outcomes_and_Student_Portfolios_to_Steer_Management_Education","247790728_The_Big_Five_Personality_Dimensions_and_Job_Performance_A_Meta-Analysis","232599285_Meta-Analysis_of_Assessment_Center_Validity","232578910_Assessment_center_correlates_of_women's_advancement_into_middle_management_A_7-year_longitudinal_analysis","232564176_A_comparison_of_rater_training_programs_Error_training_and_accuracy_training","232560072_Situational_Specificity_in_Assessment_Center_Ratings_A_Confirmatory_Factor_Analysis","232497939_Meta-analyzing_the_relationship_between_grades_and_job_performance","232359719_Relative_Contributions_of_Congruence_and_Personality_Dimensions_to_Job_Satisfaction","228197031_Some_Possible_Antecedents_and_Consequences_of_In-Role_and_Extra-Role_Salesperson_Performance","227636903_A_survey_of_assessment_center_practices_in_organizations_in_the_United_States","225948687_College_Grades_and_Adult_Achievement_A_Research_Synthesis","222359751_Satisfaction_and_performance_Causal_relationships_and_moderating_effects","14098124_Composition_Process_and_Performance_in_Self-Managed_Groups_The_Role_of_Personality"]}
