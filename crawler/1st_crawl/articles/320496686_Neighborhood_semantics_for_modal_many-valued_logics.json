{"id":"320496686_Neighborhood_semantics_for_modal_many-valued_logics","abstract":"The majority of works on modal many-valued logics consider Kripke-style possible worlds frames as the principal semantics despite their well-known axiomatizability issues when considering non-Boolean accessibility relations. The present work explores a more general semantical picture, namely a many-valued version of the classical neighborhood semantics. We present it in two levels of generality. First, we work with modal languages containing only the two usual unary modalities, define neighborhood frames over algebras of the logic FLew with operators, and show their relation with the usual Kripke semantics (this is actually the highest level of generality where one can give a straightforward definition of the Kripke-style semantics). Second, we define generalized neighborhood frames for arbitrary modal languages over a given class of algebras for an arbitrary protoalgebraic logic and, assuming certain additional conditions, axiomatize the logic of all such frames (which generalizes the completeness theorem of the classical modal logic E with respect to classical neighborhood frames).","authors":["Petr Cintula","Carles Noguera"],"meta":["October 2017Fuzzy Sets and Systems 345(1)","DOI:10.1016/j.fss.2017.10.009"],"references":["318795065_Implicational_semilinear_logics_III_completeness_properties","301515897_Abstract_Algebraic_Logic_-_An_Introductory_Textbook","235626321_Residuated_Lattices_an_algebraic_glimpse_at_substructural_logics","220592531_Implicational_semilinear_logics_I_A_new_hierarchy","220489284_Bi-modal_Godel_logic_over_01-valued_Kripke_frames","220297791_A_Proof_of_Standard_Completeness_for_Esteva_and_Godo's_Logic_MTL","220297771_Standard_Godel_Modal_Logics","23418853_On_the_Minimum_Many-Valued_Modal_Logic_over_a_Finite_Residuated_Lattice","2240439_Many-Valued_Modal_Logics","351584190_Many-Vawed_Modal_Logics_II","316792725_Advice_on_Modal_Logic","315974883_Decidability_of_order-based_modal_logics","312119946_On_modal_extensions_of_Product_fuzzy_logic","303900889_From_Kripke_to_Neighborhood_Semantics_for_Modal_Fuzzy_Logics","265989556_Exploring_a_syntactic_notion_of_modal_many-valued_logics","265545869_Protoalgebraic_Logics","257666064_Extending_Lukasiewicz_Logics_with_a_Modality_Algebraic_Approach_to_Relational_Semantics","229446199_Universal_Grammar","228832245_On_the_Metamathematics_of_Fuzzy_Logic","222815740_Fuzzy_class_theory","222596274_Godo_L_Monoidal_t-norm_Based_Logic_Towards_a_Logic_for_Left-continuous_t-norms_Fuzzy_Sets_and_Systems_1243_271-288","222402456_Fuzzy_logics_as_the_logics_of_chains","220529486_On_fuzzy_modal_logics_S5_C","51891536_Towards_a_Proof_Theory_of_Godel_Modal_Logics"]}
