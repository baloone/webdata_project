{"id":"317196639_Almost_Periodic_Solutions_for_SICNNs_with_Neutral_Type_Proportional_Delays_and_D_Operators","abstract":"This article is concerned with shunting inhibitory cellular neural networks involving neutral type proportional delays and D operators. Applying Lyapunov functional method and differential inequality techniques, we employ a novel argument to establish some new criteria on the existence and generalized exponential stability of almost periodic solutions of the addressed systems. In addition, numerical simulations are carried out to verify our theoretical findings.","authors":["Aiping Zhang"],"meta":["February 2018Neural Processing Letters 47(6)","DOI:10.1007/s11063-017-9631-5"],"references":["313019697_Exponential_Stability_of_Pseudo_Almost_Periodic_Solutions_for_Neutral_Type_Cellular_Neural_Networks_with_D_Operator","304374948_Global_Exponential_Convergence_of_Neutral_Type_Shunting_Inhibitory_Cellular_Neural_Networks_with_D_Operator","299499638_Exponential_Stability_of_Pseudo_Almost_Periodic_Solutions_for_Cellular_Neural_Networks_with_Multi-Proportional_Delays","294283439_Almost_periodic_solutions_for_fuzzy_cellular_neural_networks_with_multi-proportional_delays","324428942_Ordinary_Differential_Equations","311359935_Pseudo_almost_periodic_solutions_for_neutral_type_SICNNs_with_D_operator","304877005_Finite-time_stability_of_CNNs_with_neutral_proportional_delays_and_time-varying_leakage_delays","300371391_Global_exponential_convergence_for_a_class_of_HCNNs_with_neutral_time-proportional_delays","297650407_Global_exponential_convergence_for_a_class_of_neutral_functional_differential_equations_with_proportional_delays","293329590_Global_exponential_convergence_of_non-autonomous_cellular_neural_networks_with_multi-proportional_delays","273597706_Global_Exponential_Stability_of_Pseudo_Almost_Periodic_Solutions_for_SICNNs_with_Time-Varying_Leakage_Delays","283103421_Existence_of_positive_periodic_solutions_of_first_order_neutral_differential_equations_with_variable_coefficients","277972205_Exponential_convergence_of_SICNNs_with_delays_and_oscillating_coefficients_in_leakage_terms","274225549_Studies_in_Ordinary_Differential_Equations","271740517_Pseudo_Almost_Periodic_Solutions_for_CNNs_with_Continuously_Distributed_Leakage_Delays"]}
