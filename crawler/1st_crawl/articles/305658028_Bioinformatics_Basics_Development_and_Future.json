{"id":"305658028_Bioinformatics_Basics_Development_and_Future","abstract":"Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary scientific field of life sciences. Bioinformatics research and application include the analysis of molecular sequence and genomics data; genome annotation, gene/protein prediction, and expression profiling; molecular folding, modeling, and design; building biological networks; development of databases and data management systems; development of software and analysis tools; bioinformatics services and workflow; mining of biomedical literature and text; and bioinformatics education and training. Astronomical accumulation of genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics data as well as a need for their storage, analysis, annotation, organization, systematization, and integration into biological networks and database systems were the main driving forces for the emergence and development of bioinformatics. Current critical needs for bioinformatics among others highlighted in this chapter, however, are to understand basics and specifics of bioinformatics as well as to prepare new generation scientists and specialists with integrated, interdisciplinary, and multilingual knowledge who can use modern bioinformatics resources powered with sophisticated operating systems, software, and database/networking technologies. In this introductory chapter, I aim to give an overall picture on basics and developments of the bioinformatics field for readers with some future perspectives, highlighting chapters published in this book.\n\nAvailable for free download at: http://www.intechopen.com/books/bioinformatics-updated-features-and-applications/bioinformatics-basics-development-and-future","authors":["Ibrokhim Y Abdurakhmonov"],"meta":["July 2016","DOI:10.5772/63817","In book: Bioinformatics - Updated Features and Applications (pp.3-27)Edition: 1Chapter: 1Publisher: Intech OpenEditors: Ibrokhim Y.
