{"id":"286479100_Optimism_Predictor_Tasks_in_Children_TAPOC_Construction_and_validity_evidence","abstract":"This study aimed to develop a children's optimism scale (Optimism Predictor Tasks in Children - TAPOC). The TAPOC consists of a series of illustrated scenarios that assess optimism in children who are in the literacy process. We investigate validity evidence and reliability, and seek to evaluate optimism among the participant sample, as well as to verify possible differences between gender and age. There were 190 children (51.1% boys) participating in the sample, aged four to eight, from private schools in southern Brazil. Factor analyses were conducted that pointed to the one-factor solution and the final version of the instrument had 12 items. The scale showed good validity evidence and reliability. The results did not show significant differences in optimism levels between ages or gender.","authors":["Cláudia de Moraes Bandeira","Claudia Hofheinz Giacomoni","Claudio S Hutz"],"meta":["August 2015Revista Avaliação Psicológica 14(2):199-206","DOI:10.15689/ap.2015.1402.04"],"references":["295009852_Psicologia_do_Desenvolvimento_Infantil_Publicacoes_Nacionais_na_Primeira_Decada_do_Seculo_XXI","224826581_Recalling_yesterday_and_predicting_tomorrow","19133050_Optimism_coping_and_health_Assessment_and_implications_of_generalized_outcome_expectancies","15384510_Distinguishing_Optimism_From_Neuroticism_and_Trait_Anxiety_Self-Mastery_and_Self-Esteem_A_Reevaluation_of_the_Life_Orientation_Test","229935553_A_new_measure_for_dispositional_optimism_and_pessimism_in_young_children","41507783_Optimism","30845105_Optimism-Pessimism_and_Stress_Appraisal_Testing_a_Cognitive_Interactive_Model_of_Psychological_Adjustment_in_Adults","12215656_An_Organizational_Framework_for_Conceptualizing_Resilience_in_Children","11097131_Young_Children's_Beliefs_about_the_Stability_of_Traits_Protective_Optimism","7892721_A_new_measure_of_children's_optimism_and_pessimism_The_Youth_Life_Orientation_Test","7842414_Comparative_Optimism_About_Health_and_Nonhealth_Events_in_8-_and_9-Year-Old_Children"]}
