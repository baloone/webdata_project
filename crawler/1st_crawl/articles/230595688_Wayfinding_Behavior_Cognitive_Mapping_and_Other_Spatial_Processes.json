{"id":"230595688_Wayfinding_Behavior_Cognitive_Mapping_and_Other_Spatial_Processes","abstract":"This is an edited volume of essays by psychologists, biologists, cognitive scientists, computer scientists, and geographers on wayfinding by humans and other species. It addresses the extent to which cognitive maps may be universal, and produces evidence that humans, apes, some birds and some small mammals appear to behave as if they have internal representations that guide wayfinding processes in a map-like manner. Evidence also shows that insects, some mammals, and perhaps some birds may not evince such guided behavior, but rely more on spatial updating by dead-reckoning or pilotage. The multiple disciplinary views of wayfinding and navigation by humans and other animals gives the volume a distinctly different content from other available books.","authors":["Reginald G Golledge"],"meta":["January 1999Psycoloquy 10","Publisher: Johns Hopkins University PressISBN: 080185993X"],"references":["232557061_Chapter_23_A_cognitive_neuroscience_of_visual_cognition_Further_developments"]}
