{"id":"304506015_Maps_of_sparse_Markov_chains_efficiently_reveal_community_structure_in_network_flows_with_memory","abstract":"To better understand the flows of ideas or information through social and biological systems, researchers develop maps that reveal important patterns in network flows. In practice, network flow models have implied memoryless first-order Markov chains, but recently researchers have introduced higher-order Markov chain models with memory to capture patterns in multi-step pathways. Higher-order models are particularly important for effectively revealing actual, overlapping community structure, but higher-order Markov chain models suffer from the curse of dimensionality: their vast parameter spaces require exponentially increasing data to avoid overfitting and therefore make mapping inefficient already for moderate-sized systems. To overcome this problem, we introduce an efficient cross-validated mapping approach based on network flows modeled by sparse Markov chains. To illustrate our approach, we present a map of citation flows in science with research fields that overlap in multidisciplinary journals. Compared with currently used categories in science of science studies, the research fields form better units of analysis because the map more effectively captures how ideas flow through science.","authors":["Christian Persson","Ludvig Bohlin","Daniel Edler","Martin Rosvall"],"meta":["June 2016"],"references":["290526709_Using_higher-order_Markov_models_to_reveal_flow-based_communities_in_networks","289211064_Science_Overlay_Maps_A_New_Tool_for_Research_Policy_and_Library_Management","281896062_Modeling_sequences_and_temporal_networks_with_dynamic_community_structures","280970027_Representing_higher-order_dependencies_in_networks","275335177_The_Leiden_Manifesto_for_research_metrics","264627804_Memory_in_network_flows_and_its_effects_on_spreading_dynamics_and_community_detection","263862808_Detecting_Memory_and_Structure_in_Human_Navigation_Patterns_Using_Markov_Chain_Models_of_Varying_Order","257350831_Quantifying_Long-Term_Scientific_Impact","239927246_Variable_Length_Markov_Chains_Methodology_Computing_and_Software","234704660_Global_Maps_of_Science_Based_on_the_New_Web-of-Science_Categories","232802417_Modelling_dynamical_process_in_complex_socio-technical_systems","230610180_Betweenness_Preference_Quantifying_Correlations_in_the_Topological_Dynamics_of_Temporal_Networks","220365044_Mapping_the_Backbone_of_Science","51914402_On_Prediction_Using_Variable_Order_Markov_Models","51531106_Phase_transitions_in_contagion_processes_mediated_by_recurrent_mobility_patterns","50908777_Natural_Human_Mobility_Patterns_and_Spatial_Spread_of_Infectious_Diseases","45882658_A_Global_Map_of_Science_Based_on_the_ISI_subject_categories","45864474_A_Survey_of_Cross_Validation_Procedures_for_Model_Selection","45113478_Stability_of_graph_communities_across_time_scales","41486426_Limits_of_Predictability_in_Human_Mobility","38348465_Variable_Length_Markov_Chains","36725595_Generating_Dynamic_Higher-Order_Markov_Models_in_Web_Usage_Mining","3083909_A_universal_data_compression_system","283532282_Large-Scale_Analysis_of_the_Accuracy_of_the_Journal_Classification_Systems_of_Web_of_Science_and_Scopus","276112257_Recursive_Learning_for_Sparse_Markov_Models","259556228_Sparse_Markov_Chains_for_Sequence_Data","256468443_Human_mobility_and_time_spent_at_destination_Impact_on_spatial_epidemic_spreading","248536579_The_SXM_software_package","241624113_Are_web_users_really_Markovian","235418978_A_Mathematical_Theory_of_Communication","227737873_Algorithmic_procedure_for_finding_semantically_related_journals","220447062_The_Anatomy_of_a_Large-Scale_Hypertextual_Web_Search_Engine","220411114_A_Mathematical_Theory_of_Communication","200047922_The_Anatomy_of_a_Large-Scale_Hypertextual_Web_Search_Engine","45885016_Can_Scientific_Journals_be_Classified_in_Terms_of_Aggregated_Journal-Journal_Citation_Relations_using_the_Journal_Citation_Reports","43020118_Community_Detection_Algorithms_A_Comparative_Analysis","9259405_Networks_Of_Scientific_Papers","5635994_Maps_of_Random_Walks_on_Complex_Networks_Reveal_Community_Structure","3084316_Complexity_of_strings_in_the_class_of_Markov_sources"]}
