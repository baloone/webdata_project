{"id":"277829758_Student_perceptions_of_educational_games_in_higher_education_An_empirical_study","abstract":"Studies of educational games (EG) have attracted researchers' attention especially in the last few years due to its promising potential as well as the factor of preferences of younger generations. Studies have found that EG can enhanced teaching and learning process. However, its acceptance rate is rather slow because of some reasons. Understanding students' acceptance factors can help designers design specific applications for intended users. This study investigated the factors that might affect student acceptance of EG. Derived upon user acceptance theory, we proposed and tested several factors (performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence and attitude) towards student preferences to use EG. This study present the details of instruments used and result of analysis done using descriptive and regression analysis. Findings would be useful for EG designers and policy makers in understanding student perceptions toward EG, hence, provide some guidelines in design and implementation of EG.","authors":["Roslina Ibrahim","Samsudin Wahab","Rasimah Yusoff","Khalili Khalil"],"meta":["January 2011"],"references":["282054005_Digital_game-based_learning_DGBL_model_and_development_methodology_for_teaching_history","258846992_Perceived_Usefulness_Perceived_Ease_Of_Use_And_User_Accep","251899148_Educational_games_EG_design_framework_Combination_of_game_design_pedagogy_and_content_modeling","229906403_Factors_affecting_teachers'_adoption_of_educational_computer_games_A_case_study","228890658_A_Conceptualized_Framework_for_Edutainment","312984568_Perceived_usefulness_perceived_ease_and_user_acceptance_of_information_technology","285189428_Games_and_learning","262104780_Designing_Computer_Games_to_Introduce_Programming_to_children","238374519_What_Video_Games_Have_to_Teach_Us_About_Learning_and_Literacy","228436638_An_application_of_the_UTAUT_model_for_understanding_student_perceptions_using_course_management_software"]}
