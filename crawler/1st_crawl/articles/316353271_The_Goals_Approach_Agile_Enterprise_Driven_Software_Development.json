{"id":"316353271_The_Goals_Approach_Agile_Enterprise_Driven_Software_Development","abstract":"Continuous Business Process Improvement (BPI) is necessary in order to maintain and develop the enterprise competitiveness. However, achieving a level of software development performance that matches enterprise needs in terms of producing noticeable results within small amounts of time is a persnickety task, mainly because most available methods do not deliver full software architectures that can be directly used for in-house software development without iterations between implementation and design, as produced specifications are too close to the user interface, or too close to business regulations and domain modeling. Our approach applies a method that structures business processes, business rules and domain concepts, and uses this information in order to identify user tasks (use cases) and interaction spaces, and by means of their detail, methodically specify the software architecture for a particular BPI, bridging business and software using cross-consistent concepts. We present a theoretical example, and the validation of our method.","authors":["Pedro Valente","Thiago Rocha Silva","Marco Winckler","Nuno Jardim Nunes"],"meta":["April 2017","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-52593-8_13","In book: Complexity in Information Systems Development (pp.201-219)","Project: Enterprise and Software Implementation Traceability"],"references":["286035722_Principles_of_Cross-Consistency_Assessment_in_Morphological_Modelling","282939251_Improving_Software_Design_Decisions_towards_Enhanced_Return_of_Investment","274711974_Value-oriented_Enterprise_Transformation_-_Design_and_Engineering_of_Value_Networks","259687902_The_SPRINT-SMEs_Approach_for_Software_Process_Improvement_in_Small-Medium_sized_Software_Development_Enterprises","244473739_Object_Modeling_for_User-Centered_Development_and_User_Interface_Design_The_Wisdom_Approach","288195526_Foreword_by_John_Grundy_Architecture_vs_Agile_Competition_or_cooperation","284194614_Usability_Aspects_of_the_Inside-in_Approach_for_Ancillary_Search_Tasks_on_the_Web","274852078_ProductService_Strategy","266369165_Model-View-Controller_MVC_Architecture","248344837_'Management_by_projects'_the_management_approach_for_the_future"]}
