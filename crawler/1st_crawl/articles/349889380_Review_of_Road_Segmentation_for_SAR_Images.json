{"id":"349889380_Review_of_Road_Segmentation_for_SAR_Images","abstract":"Road segmentation for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images is of great practical significance. With the rapid development and wide application of SAR imaging technology, this problem has attracted much attention. At present, there are numerous road segmentation methods. This paper analyzes and summarizes the road segmentation methods for SAR images over the years. Firstly, the traditional road segmentation algorithms are classified according to the degree of automation and the principle. Advantages and disadvantages are introduced successively for each traditional method. Then, the popular segmentation methods based on deep learning in recent years are systematically introduced. Finally, novel deep segmentation neural networks based on the capsule paradigm and the self-attention mechanism are forecasted as future research for SAR images.","authors":["Zengguo Sun","Hui Geng","Zheng Lu","Rafal Scherer"],"meta":["March 2021Remote Sensing 13(5):1011","DOI:10.3390/rs13051011"],"references":["339762001_Sample_Generation_with_Self-Attention_Generative_Adversarial_Adaptation_Network_SaGAAN_for_Hyperspectral_Image_Classification","337564039_Arbitrary-oriented_target_detection_in_large_scene_sar_images","330830491_A_SAR_change_detection_method_based_on_the_consistency_of_single-pixel_difference_and_neighbourhood_difference","328584980_Speckle_Noise_Suppression_in_SAR_Images_Using_a_Three-Step_Algorithm","339635006_BG-SAC_Entity_relationship_classification_model_based_on_Self-Attention_supported_Capsule_Networks","339561574_Dual_Directed_Capsule_Network_for_Very_Low_Resolution_Image_Recognition","338522088_Bidirectional_LSTM_with_self-attention_mechanism_and_multi-channel_features_for_sentiment_classification","337598533_A_Fusion_Network_for_Road_Detection_via_Spatial_Propagation_and_Spatial_Transformation","337522996_Deep_Learning_Road_Extraction_Model_Based_on_Similarity_Mapping_Relationship","328985048_Synthetic_Aperture_Radar_Ship_Detection_Using_Capsule_Networks"]}
