{"id":"323787669_Routing_and_wavelength_assignment_for_exchanged_crossed_cubes_on_ring-topology_optical_networks","abstract":"The exchanged crossed cube, denoted by \\(\\textit{ECQ}(s, t)\\), is a novel graph with fewer edges and smaller diameter compared to other variations of the corresponding hypercube. The ring topology, denoted by \\(R_n\\), is one of the most popular topologies in Wavelength division multiplexing optical networks. This paper addresses the routing and wavelength assignment problem for realizing \\(\\textit{ECQ}(s, t)\\) communication pattern on \\(R_n\\), where \\(n=s+t+1\\). We propose an embedding scheme. Base on the embedding scheme, a wavelength assignment algorithm using \\(2^{s+t-2}+\\lfloor 2^t/3\\rfloor \\) wavelengths is devised. We show that the wavelength assignment algorithm uses no more than 1.25 times of wavelengths compared to the optimal wavelength number, i.e., it is a factor 1.25 approximation algorithm. Moreover, the number of additional required wavelengths is no more than \\(\\lfloor 2^{t-1}/3\\rfloor \\).","authors":["Yu-Liang Liu"],"meta":["October 2018Soft Computing 22(20):6693-6703","DOI:10.1007/s00500-018-3071-7"],"references":["328095993_Realizing_Exchanged_Crossed_Cube_Communication_Patterns_on_Linear_Array_WDM_Optical_Networks","321521130_Approximation_Algorithms","321407821_Implementing_Exchanged_Hypercube_Communication_Patterns_on_Ring-Connected_WDM_Optical_Networks","317104291_Optimal_Path_Embedding_in_the_Exchanged_Crossed_Cube","315527566_Cycles_Embedding_in_Exchanged_Crossed_Cube","297678766_Locally_exchanged_twisted_cubes_Connectivity_and_super_connectivity","286010031_The_congestion_of_generalized_cube_communication_pattern_in_linear_array_network","284017271_The_super_connectivity_of_exchanged_crossed_cube","276852455_An_exchanged_folded_hypercube-based_topology_structure_for_interconnection_networks","273001794_Approximation_Algorithms","271819361_Dynamic_wavelength_assignment_for_realizing_hypercube-based_Bitonic_sorting_on_wavelength_division_multiplexing_linear_arrays","269730395_Routing_and_Wavelength_Assignment_for_Exchanged_Hypercubes_in_Linear_Array_Optical_Networks","268694624_The_connectivity_of_exchanged_crossed_cube","260954296_Implementing_duplex_crossed_cube_communication_patterns_on_optical_linear_arrays","260440389_Wavelength_assignment_for_locally_twisted_cube_communication_pattern_on_optical_bus_network-on-chip"]}
