{"id":"283465841_Relation_lifting_a_survey","abstract":"We survey work in category theory and coalgebra on how to extend a functor from maps to relations. This relation lifting has a universal property, which is presented in some detail and guides us to generalisations to monotone and many-valued relations. As applications, it is shown how different notions of bisimulation, simulation and modal logics do arise.","authors":["Alexander Kurz","Jiří Velebil"],"meta":["October 2015Journal of Logical and Algebraic Methods in Programming 85(4)","DOI:10.1016/j.jlamp.2015.08.002"],"references":["299454664_Lax_Extensions_of_Coalgebra_Functors_and_Their_Logic","276840903_Lax_Extensions_of_Coalgebra_Functors","260914657_Logical_Relations_and_Parametricity_-_A_Reynolds_Programme_for_Category_Theory_and_Programming_Languages","257642515_Relators_and_Metric_Bisimulations_Extended_Abstract","249964145_Relation_lifting_with_an_application_to_the_many-valued_cover_modality","228460009_Relation_Liftings_on_Preorders_and_Posets","225417568_Some_algebraic_theory_for_many-valued_relation_algebras","222900804_Stably_Compact_Spaces_and_Closed_Relations","222800959_Coinduction_for_recursive_data_types_Partial_orders_metric_spaces_and_O-categories","222493081_A_Coalgebraic_Foundation_for_Linear_Time_Semantics","221509704_Elements_of_a_Relational_Theory_of_Datatypes","39997543_Modal_Logics_are_Coalgebraic","2716820_A_Relational_Approach_to_Strictness_Analysis_for_Higher-Order_Polymorphic_Functions","266177013_Relations_et_carres_exacts","265992413_Every_Standard_Construction_is_Induced_by_a_Pair_of_Adjoint_Functors","265621394_A_2-categorical_approach_to_change_of_base_and_geometric_morphisms_II","259363207_A_general_final_coalgebra_theorem","251275443_Relational_algebras","235223682_The_formal_theory_of_monads","227612535_On_the_Duality_of_Compact_vs_Open","223841803_Terminal_Coalgebras_in_Well-Founded_Set_Theory","222840479_Universal_coalgebra_A_theory_of_systems","222506443_Coalgebraic_Logic","222404747_On_coalgebra_based_on_classes","222350607_An_algebraic_formalization_of_fuzzy_relations","221570221_Similarity_Quotients_as_Final_Coalgebras","220529910_Arrow_categories","220443364_General_theory_of_relational_automata","220152995_Coalgebraic_Semantics_of_Modal_Logics_an_Overview","2522550_A_Categorical_Outlook_on_Relational_Modalities_and_Simulations","2244678_Structural_Induction_and_Coinduction_in_a_Fibrational_Setting"]}
