{"id":"315807337_Lyapunov_criteria_for_uniform_convergence_of_conditional_distributions_of_absorbed_Markov_processes","abstract":"We study the quasi-stationary behavior of multidimensional processes absorbed when one of the coordinates vanishes. Our results cover competitive or weakly cooperative Lotka-Volterra birth and death processes and Feller diffusions with competitive Lotka-Volterra interaction. To this aim, we develop original non-linear Lyapunov criteria involving two Lyapunov functions, which apply to general Markov processes.","authors":["Nicolas Champagnat","Denis Villemonais"],"meta":["April 2017Stochastic Processes and their Applications 135(4)","DOI:10.1016/j.spa.2020.12.005"],"references":["313844513_On_time_scales_and_quasi-stationary_distributions_for_multitype_birth-and-death_processes","309797939_Population_processes_with_unbounded_extinction_rate_conditioned_to_non-extinction","309766194_Uniform_convergence_to_the_Q-process","286163548_Existence_and_Uniqueness_of_a_Quasistationary_Distribution_for_Markov_Processes_with_Fast_Return_from_Infinity","344489299_Quasistationary_distributions_for_one-dimensional_diffusions_with_killing","323897219_Uniform_convergence_of_conditional_distributions_for_absorbed_one-dimensional_diffusions","316268575_Multidimensional_Diffusion_Processes","305976533_Stability_of_Markovian_Processes_III_Foster-Lyapunov_Criteria_for_Continuous-Time_Processes","297404441_QUASI-STATIONARY_DISTRIBUTIONS_AND_CONVERGENCE_TO_QUASI-STATIONARITY_OF_BIRTH-DEATH_PROCESSES","284579394_Approximation_of_stochastic_processes_by_non-expansive_flows_and_coming_down_from_infinity"]}
