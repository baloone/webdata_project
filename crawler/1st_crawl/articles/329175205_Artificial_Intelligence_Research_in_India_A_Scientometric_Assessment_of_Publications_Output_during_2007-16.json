{"id":"329175205_Artificial_Intelligence_Research_in_India_A_Scientometric_Assessment_of_Publications_Output_during_2007-16","abstract":"div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 1\"> \nThe paper examines the world output in artificial intelligence research, a total of 1,52,655 publications, as seen from Scopus database, covering the period during 2007-16. The top 10 countries of the world in artificial intelligence research accounted for 74.32 per cent global publication share. Individually their global share varied from 3.68 per cent to 19.46 per cent, with China accounting for 19.46 per cent global share, followed by the USA (17.96 %), India (6.37 %), and the U.K. (6.33 %), etc. The paper also examines publications output by India in artificial intelligence research. India cumulated a total of 9730 publications in 10 years during 2007-16, registered an annual average growth rate of 27.45 per cent, averaged citation impact to 2.76 citations per paper, and contributed 10.34 per cent share of its total country output as international collaborative publications during 2007-16. Computer science accounted for the largest publication share (86.99 %), followed by engineering (30.69 %), mathematics (15.95 %), biochemistry, genetics & molecular biology (4.66 %), and several other disciplines. The top 10 organizations and 10 authors together accounted for 19.31 per cent and 2.71 per cent national publications share respectively and 29.78 per cent share and 6.85 per cent national citation share respectively during 2007-16. Top 10 journals accounted for 15.45 per cent share of the country output appearing in journal medium (1650 papers). India accounted for 24 highly cited papers, averaging to 162.46 citations per paper. These 24 highly cited papers involved the participation of 109 authors from 70 organizations, published in 15 journals. \n\n</div","authors":["Brij Mohan Gupta","Surinder M Dhawan"],"meta":["November 2018DESIDOC Journal of Library & Information Technology 38(6):416-422","DOI:10.14429/djlit.38.6.12309"],"references":["327821725_Performance_of_Artificial_Intelligence_Research_Output_A_Scientometric_Analysis","320191882_Highly_Cited_Publications_Output_by_India_in_Computer_Science_1996-15_A_Scientometric_Assessment","303318727_Global_Research_on_Artificial_Intelligence_from_1990-2014_Spatially-Explicit_Bibliometric_Analysis","267966386_Indian_Computer_Science_Research_Output_during_1999-2008_Qualitative_Analysis","220364548_Mapping_of_Indian_computer_science_research_output_1999-2008","303389899_Artificial_Intelligence_Research_in_India_A_Scientometric_Analysis","284453100_Computer_Science_Research_in_India_A_Scientometric_Analysis_of_Research_Output_During_the_Period","220433126_Mapping_Change_in_Scientific_Specialties_A_Scientometric_Reconstruction_of_the_Development_of_Artificial_Intelligence"]}
