{"id":"312120567_Geometric_Mean_Distance_-_An_Evaluation_of_its_Accuracy_for_Inductance_Calculations","abstract":"The principle of Geometric Mean Distance (GMD) is widely used for simplifying\ninductance calculations, but it is an approximate method and there is a dearth of\navailable information discussing its accuracy. In the present work, the GMD method's\naccuracy is evaluated quantitatively for two common and practical cases—the self\ninductance of a circular loop, and the mutual inductance of two parallel co-axial circular\nloops of equal radius—for the complete range of possible conductor diameter to loop\ndiameter ratios. The results of these two cases are combined and extended to address\nmulti turn solenoid coils. From the study data, empirical formulae are developed to\ncalculate correction factors to improve the accuracy of GMD based inductance\ncalculations.","authors":["Robert S Weaver"],"meta":["January 2017","DOI:10.13140/RG.2.2.24414.23367"],"references":["268200039_The_Inductance_of_a_Helix_of_Any_Pitch","243774153_Algorithm_AS_183_An_Efficient_and_Portable_Pseudo-Random_Number_Generator","230429172_Ueber_die_Berechnung_und_Messung_kleiner_Selbstpotentiale","50335363_Absolute_Measurements_in_Electricity_and_Magnetism"]}
