{"id":"266858601_Capacity_of_a_quantum_communication_channel","abstract":"An example is constructed that shows that the additive property C//m// plus m equals C//m plus C//m that is characteristic of the capacities in classical information theory need not obtain for a quantum communications channel. In view of this, the definition itself of capacity of a quantum communications channel is in need of refinement. By using the property of subadditiveness, C//n// plus //m less than equivalent to C//n plus C//m, which is maintained in the quantum case, it is natural to define the capacity as C equals 1im C//n/n as n goes to infinity . Generally speaking, C greater than C//1 in this case. An analog of the classical coding theorem obtains for C. Some bounds are obtained for the capacity C.","authors":["Alexander S.
