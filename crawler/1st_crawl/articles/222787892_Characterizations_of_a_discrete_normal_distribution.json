{"id":"222787892_Characterizations_of_a_discrete_normal_distribution","abstract":"The paper obtains a discrete analogue of the normal distribution as the distribution that is characterized by maximum entropy, specified mean and variance, and integer support on (− ∞, ∞). Two alternative characterizations are given, firstly as the distribution of the difference of two related Heine distributions, and secondly as a weighted distribution.","authors":["Adrienne Winifred Kemp"],"meta":["October 1997Journal of Statistical Planning and Inference 63(2):223-229","DOI:10.1016/S0378-3758(97)00020-7"],"references":["305982863_Why_the_Shannon_and_Hartley_entropies_are_'natural'","312369415_Note_on_the_generation_of_most_probable_frequency_distributions","305974803_Oil_exploration_sequential_decisions_in_the_face_of_uncertainty","305974423_Steady-state_Markov_chain_models_for_the_Heine_and_Euler_distributions","285690783_The_frequency_distribution_of_the_difference_between_two_independent_variates_following_the_same_Poisson_distribution","270254615_Choquet-Deny_Type_Functional_Equations_with_Applications_to_Stochastic_Models","269502081_Linear_Statistical_Inference_and_Its_Applications","266505651_Some_questions_in_characterization_theory","266409647_Choquet-Deny_Type_Functional_Equations_with_Applications_to_Stochastic_Models","265682062_Steady-State_Markov_Chain_Models_for_the_Heine_and_Euler_Distributions","265461586_Oil_Exploration_Sequential_Decisions_in_the_Face_of_Uncertainty","265424956_Why_the_Shannon_and_Hartley_Entropies_Are_'Natural'","265373194_Mathematical_Foundations_of_Information_Theory","243763440_Maximum_Entropy_Models_In_Science_and_Engineering","243101017_Cauchy_Equation_on_Discrete_Domain_and_Some_Characterization_Theorems","238866604_Heine-Euler_extensions_of_the_Poisson_distribution","236560563_Discrete_Pearson_distributions","42274671_The_frequency_distribution_of_the_difference_between_two_Poisson_variates_belonging_to_different_populations","37408209_The_Theory_of_Partitions"]}
