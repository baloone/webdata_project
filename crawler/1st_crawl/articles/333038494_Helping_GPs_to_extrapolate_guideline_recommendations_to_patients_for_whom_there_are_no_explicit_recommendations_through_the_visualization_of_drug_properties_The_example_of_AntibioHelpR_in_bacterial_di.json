These 2 limitations result in poor CDSS adoption. We designed AntibioHelp® as a CDSS for antibiotic treatment. It displays the recommended and nonrecommended antibiotics, together with their properties, weighted by degree of importance as outlined in the CPGs. The aim of this study was to determine whether AntibioHelp® could increase the confidence of general practitioners (GPs) in CPG recommendations and help them to extrapolate guidelines to patients for whom CPGs provide no explicit recommendations.\n\nMaterials and methods: \nWe carried out a 2-stage crossover study in which GPs responded to clinical cases using CPG recommendations either alone or with explanations displayed through AntibioHelp®. We compared error rates, confidence levels, and response times.\n\nResults: \nWe included 64 GPs. When no explicit recommendation existed for a particular situation, AntibioHelp® significantly decreased the error rate (-41%, P value = 6x10-13), and significantly increased GP confidence (+8%, P value = .02). This CDSS was considered to be usable by GPs (SUS score = 64), despite a longer interaction time (+9-22 seconds). By contrast, AntibioHelp® had no significant effect if there was an explicit recommendation.\n\nDiscussion/conclusion: \nThe visualization of weighted antibiotic properties helps GPs to extrapolate recommendations to patients for whom CPGs provide no explicit recommendations. It also increases GP confidence in their prescriptions for these patients. Further evaluations are required to determine the impact of AntibioHelp® on antibiotic prescriptions in real clinical practice.","authors":["Rosy Tsopra","Karima Sedki","Melanie Courtine","Hector
