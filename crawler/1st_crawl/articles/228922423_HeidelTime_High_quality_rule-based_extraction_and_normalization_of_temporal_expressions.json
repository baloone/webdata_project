{"id":"228922423_HeidelTime_High_quality_rule-based_extraction_and_normalization_of_temporal_expressions","abstract":"In this paper, we describe HeidelTime, a system for the extraction and normaliza-tion of temporal expressions. HeidelTime is a rule-based system mainly using regu-lar expression patterns for the extraction of temporal expressions and knowledge re-sources as well as linguistic clues for their normalization. In the TempEval-2 chal-lenge, HeidelTime achieved the highest F-Score (86%) for the extraction and the best results in assigning the correct value at-tribute, i.e., in understanding the seman-tics of the temporal expressions.","authors":["Jannik Str√∂tgen","Michael Gertz"],"meta":["August 2010","Project: HeidelTime"],"references":["237523037_Evaluating_Events_Time_Expressions_and_Temporal_Relations_TempEval-2","221249487_Extraction_and_exploration_of_spatio-temporal_information_in_documents","2393836_From_Temporal_Expressions_to_Temporal_Information_Semantic_Tagging_of_News_Messages"]}
