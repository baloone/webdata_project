{"id":"286385192_Les_reformulations_comportant_des_exemples_dans_les_cours_magistraux_de_l'enseignement_superieur","abstract":"At University, lectures are the primary mode of communication (Bouchard and Parpette, 2007, 2009). Reformulations are numerous. Among the various types of reformulations (GÃ¼lich and Kotschi, 1987), exemplification is a means frequently used to make students understand the terminology employed in the discipline. This paper aims to analyse exemplification in videotapes of four teachers teaching first year Linguistics students to convey the same course content. Teachers rely on different teaching materials : technological media (PowerPoint) or traditional handouts and use of the blackboard. Based on the work of Coltier (1988), we try to characterize exemples and understand how these exemples can contribute to the construction and processing of knowledge for students through their note taking.","authors":["Marie-France Roquelaure","Garcia-Debanc Claudine"],"meta":["November 2015","DOI:10.4000/corela.4066"],"references":["326371747_Introduction_et_gestion_des_exemples_dans_les_textes_a_these","273942750_Le_francais_parle_Transcription_edition"]}
