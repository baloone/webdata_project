{"id":"348750141_Pyformlang_An_Educational_Library_for_Formal_Language_Manipulation","abstract":"Formal languages are widely studied, taught and used in computer science. However, only a small part of this domain is brought to a broader audience, and students often have no practical experience in their curriculum. In this tool paper, we introduce Pyformlang, a practical and pedagogical Python library for formal languages. Our library implements the most common algorithms of the domain, accessible by an easy-to-use interface. The code is written exclusively in Python3, with a clear structure, so as to allow students to play and learn with it.","authors":["Julien Romero"],"meta":["March 2021","DOI:10.1145/3408877.3432464"],"references":["333418429_Commonsense_Properties_from_Query_Logs_and_Question_Answering_Forums","275652921_A_Virtual_Programming_Lab_for_Moodle_with_automatic_assessment_and_anti-plagiarism_features","262157243_Implementation_Concepts_in_Vaucanson_2","339510405_Teaching_Formal_Languages_through_Visualizations_Simulators_Auto-graded_Exercises_and_Programmed_Instruction","331301328_Using_Interactive_Visualization_and_Programmed_Instruction_to_Teach_Formal_Languages","319394622_Introduction_to_Automata_Theory_Languages_and_Computation_2nd_Edition","312829051_A_Tool_for_Intersecting_Context-Free_Grammars_and_Its_Applications","291356064_Game_AI_Pro_2_Collected_Wisdom_of_Game_AI_Professionals","280113549_Speech_and_Language_Processing","266886948_An_Introduction_to_Formal_Language_Theory_that_Integrates_Experimentation_and_Proof"]}
