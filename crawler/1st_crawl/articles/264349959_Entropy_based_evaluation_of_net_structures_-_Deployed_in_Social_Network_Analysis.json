{"id":"264349959_Entropy_based_evaluation_of_net_structures_-_Deployed_in_Social_Network_Analysis","abstract":"The analysis of Social Networks widely is based on their respective graphical structures. Centrality measures of actors usually consider their position in a graph. Sometimes graphs are an insufficient medium to represent social structures. In this paper the authors propose a new framework with the purpose to analyze social fabric correctly: information theory. A set of conditionals forms the knowledge base about the network’s structure. Once the knowledge base is adapted under maximum entropy or minimum cross-entropy a new form of analysis is available. The construction of knowledge bases and their analyses are realized in the expert system shell SPIRIT.","authors":["Wilhelm Rödder","Dominic Brenner","Friedhelm Kulmann"],"meta":["December 2014Expert Systems with Applications 41(17):7968–7979","DOI:10.1016/j.eswa.2014.06.049"],"references":["244508407_The_Distribution_of_Power_in_Exchange_Networks","235120350_Deduction_and_Inference_Using_Conditional_Logic_and_Probability","222538101_Centrality_and_Network_Flow","41011100_Konzepte_und_Methoden_der_sozialwissenschaftlichen_Netzwerkanalyse_Eine_aktuelle_Ubersicht","313073813_Local_Computations_with_Probabilities_on_Graphical_Structures_and_Their_Application_to_Expert_Systems","280566512_Networks_An_Introduction","279711686_Concepts_and_methods_in_social_network_analysis_An_overview_of_recent_developments","265348019_Many-Valued_Logic","264920260_Networks_An_Introduction","261371357_Social_network_user_influence_sense-making_and_dynamics_prediction","260111702_An_efficient_algorithm_for_community_mining_with_overlap_in_social_networks","258188510_Social_Network_Analysis","239060167_Social_Networks_in_Urban_Situations","230596020_Local_Computations_With_Probabilities_on_Graphical_Structures_and_Their_Application_to_Expert_Systems","229125223_The_Concept_and_Use_of_Social_Networks","229124516_Power_and_Centrality_A_Family_of_Measures","225501301_A_New_Status_Index_Derived_From_Sociometric_Analysis","223616253_On_the_measurability_of_knowledge_acquisition_and_query_processing","222785720_A_Note_on_the_Inevitability_of_Maximum_Entropy","222257705_Conditional_logic_and_the_Principle_of_Entropy","220815043_Knowledge_Processing_under_Information_Fidelity","220694469_Introduction_to_coding_and_information_theory","220545767_Characterizing_the_Principle_of_Minimum_Cross-Entropy_Within_a_Conditional-Logical_Framework","220314770_Recall_and_Reasoning-an_information_theoretical_model_of_cognitive_processes","216636713_Eigenvector-Like_Measures_of_Centrality_for_Asymmetric_Relations","200773343_Who_Shall_Survive_Foundations_of_Sociometry_Group_Psychotherapy_and_Sociodrama","200110621_Social_Network_Analysis_A_Handbook","31398459_Features_of_the_expert-system-shell_SPIRIT","3083296_Axiomatic_Derivation_of_the_Principle_of_Maximum_Entropy_and_the_Principle_of_Minimum_Cross-Entropy"]}
