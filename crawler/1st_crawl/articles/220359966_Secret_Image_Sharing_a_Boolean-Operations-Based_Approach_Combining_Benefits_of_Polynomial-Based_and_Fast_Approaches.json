{"id":"220359966_Secret_Image_Sharing_a_Boolean-Operations-Based_Approach_Combining_Benefits_of_Polynomial-Based_and_Fast_Approaches","abstract":"In secret image sharing, a polynomial interpolation technique heavy experiences a computation load when the secret image is retrieved later. To the contrary, fast approaches often need larger storage space due to pixel expansion property. This paper proposes a missing-allowable (k, n) scheme which is fast and with a reasonable pixel expansion rate (per). The scheme generates n extremely-noisy shadow images for the given secret color image A, and any k out of these n shadows can recover A loss-freely. In average, to decode a color pixel of A, the retrieval uses only three exclusion-OR operations among 24-bit numbers. Hence, the new method has very fast decoding speed, and its pixel expansion rate is always acceptable (0 < per < 2).","authors":["Kun-Yuan Chao","Ja-Chen Lin"],"meta":["March 2009International Journal of Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence 23(02):263-285","DOI:10.1142/S0218001409007090","SourceDBLP"],"references":["4146961_A_color_image_secret_sharing_scheme_satisfying_the_perfect_reconstruction_property","3386765_Colour_image_secret_sharing","3308588_An_Image-Sharing_Method_with_User-Friendly_Shadow_Images","261860613_Rapid_and_brief_communication_Bit-level_based_secret_sharing_for_image_encryption","238474843_Multi-channel_Secret_Image_Transmission_with_Fast_Decoding_By_using_Bit-level_Sharing_and_Economic-size_Shares","223891738_Visual_cryptography_for_gray-level_images_by_dithering_techniques","223635307_Fault-tolerant_and_progressive_transmission_of_images","223332824_Sharing_and_hiding_secret_images_with_size_constraint","223067499_Secret_image_sharing_with_smaller_shadow_images","222839888_Secret_image_sharing","222700991_Visual_cryptography_for_color_images","222650484_New_visual_secret_sharing_schemes_using_probabilistic_method","221199561_Colored_Probabilistic_Visual_Cryptography_Scheme_with_Reversing","220643918_Aspect_ratio_invariant_visual_secret_sharing_schemes_with_minimum_pixel_expansion","220600155_Two_secret_sharing_schemes_based_on_Boolean_operations_Pattern_Recognition_4010_2776-2785","220460477_A_cost-effective_encryption_scheme_for_color_images","220359782_Extended_Visual_Secret_Sharing_Schemes_Improving_the_Shadow_Image_Quality"]}
