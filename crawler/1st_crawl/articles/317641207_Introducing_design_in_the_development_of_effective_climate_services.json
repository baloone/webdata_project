{"id":"317641207_Introducing_design_in_the_development_of_effective_climate_services","abstract":"Seasonal to decadal climate predictions have the potential to inform different sectors in adapting their short to medium term practices and plans to climate variability and change. The data these predictions generate, however, is still not readily usable, nor widely used in decision-making. This paper addresses two key challenges: a domain challenge pertaining to an emerging climate services market, where users, tasks and data may be unknown; and an informational challenge pertaining to the interpretation, use and adoption of novel and complex scientific data.","authors":["Isadora Christel Jim√©nez","Drew Hemment","Dragana Bojovic","Fernando M.
