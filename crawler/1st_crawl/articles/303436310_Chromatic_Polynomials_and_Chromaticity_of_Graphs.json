{"id":"303436310_Chromatic_Polynomials_and_Chromaticity_of_Graphs","abstract":"This is the first book to comprehensively cover chromatic polynomials of graphs. It includes most of the known results and unsolved problems in the area of chromatic polynomials. Dividing the book into three main parts, the authors take readers from the rudiments of chromatic polynomials to more complex topics: the chromatic equivalence classes of graphs and the zeros and inequalities of chromatic polynomials. The early material is well suited to a graduate level course while the latter parts will be an invaluable resource for postgraduate students and researchers in combinatorics and graph theory.
