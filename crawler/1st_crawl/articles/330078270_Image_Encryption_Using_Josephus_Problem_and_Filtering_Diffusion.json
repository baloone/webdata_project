{"id":"330078270_Image_Encryption_Using_Josephus_Problem_and_Filtering_Diffusion","abstract":"Image encryption is an efficient and visual technology to protect private images. This work develops an image encryption algorithm utilizing the principles of the Josephus problem [1] and the filtering technology. The encryption algorithm follows the classical diffusion and confusion structure. The principle of the Josephus problem is used to shuffle image pixels to different positions to achieve the confusion property. Using a randomly generated filter, the filtering technology can spread slight changes of the original image to all pixels of the cipher-image to obtain diffusion property. The simulation results show that the developed image encryption algorithm is able to encrypt different kinds of images into cipher-images with uniform distribution. The security analysis demonstrates that it has extremely sensitive secret key, can resist various security attacks, and has better performance than several advanced image encryption algorithms.","authors":["Zhongyun Hua","Binxuan Xu","Fan Jin","Hejiao Huang"],"meta":["January 2019IEEE Access PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2890116"],"references":["330071500_A_fast_image_encryption_algorithm_based_on_non-adjacent_dynamically_coupled_map_lattice_model","327795760_A_color_image_cryptosystem_based_on_dynamic_DNA_encryption_and_chaos","321328793_Robust_Encryption_of_Quantum_Medical_Images","328138281_Modified_integral_imaging_reconstruction_and_encryption_using_an_improved_SR_reconstruction_algorithm","324930073_Sine_Chaotification_Model_for_Enhancing_Chaos_and_Its_Hardware_Implementation","323927222_Cryptanalyzing_and_Improving_a_Novel_Color_Image_Encryption_Algorithm_Using_RT-Enhanced_Chaotic_Tent_Maps","323827708_2D_Logistic-Sine-Coupling_Map_for_Image_Encryption","323649983_Reversible_data_hiding_in_encrypted_images_using_adaptive_block-level_prediction-error_expansion","323347158_An_Image_Encryption_Algorithm_Based_on_Josephus_Traversing_and_Mixed_Chaotic_Map","322090239_Designing_permutation-substitution_image_encryption_networks_with_Henon_map","320890967_Cryptanalyzing_an_Image_Encryption_Algorithm_Based_on_Autoblocking_and_Electrocardiography","320229438_Medical_image_encryption_using_high-speed_scrambling_and_pixel_adaptive_diffusion","319401178_A_novel_bit-level_image_encryption_algorithm_based_on_2D-LICM_hyperchaotic_map","318975239_Sine-Transform-Based_Chaotic_System_with_FPGA_Implementation","318848358_Cryptanalyzing_an_Image-Scrambling_Encryption_Algorithm_of_Pixel_Bits"]}
