{"id":"327399291_The_Implementation_of_Computer_based_Test_on_BYOD_and_Cloud_Computing_Environment","abstract":"Computer-based test promises several benefits such as automatic grading, assessment features, and paper efficiency. However, besides the benefits, the organization should prepare the enough infrastructure, network connectivity, and user education. The problem upsurges when a hundred numbers of users join the computer-based test. This article proposes Bring-Your-Own-Devices (BYOD), and the cloud computing approach to facilitate a hundred numbers of exam participant. Through the experiment method on 393 students, the article determines five central practices that can be used by the organization who want to implement the massive scale computer-based test.
