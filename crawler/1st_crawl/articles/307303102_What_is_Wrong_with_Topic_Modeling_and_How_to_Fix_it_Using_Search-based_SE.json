{"id":"307303102_What_is_Wrong_with_Topic_Modeling_and_How_to_Fix_it_Using_Search-based_SE","abstract":"Topic Modeling finds human-readable structures in large sets of unstructured SE data. A widely used topic modeler is Latent Dirichlet Allocation. When run on SE data, LDA suffers from \"order effects\" i.e. different topics be generated if the training data was shuffled into a different order. Such order effects introduce a systematic error for any study that uses topics to make conclusions. This paper introduces LDADE, a Search-Based SE tool that tunes LDA's parameters using DE (Differential Evolution). LDADE has been tested on data from a programmer information exchange site (Stackoverflow), title and abstract text of thousands of SE papers, and software defect reports from NASA. Results were collected across different implementations of LDA (Python+Scikit-Learn, Scala+Spark); across different platforms (Linux, Macintosh) and for different kinds of LDAs (the traditional VEM method, or using Gibbs sampling). In all tests, the pattern was the same: LDADE's tunings dramatically reduces topic instability. The implications of this study for other software analytics tasks is now an open and pressing issue. In how many domains can search-based SE dramatically improve software analytics?","authors":["Amritanshu Agrawal","Wei Fu","Tim Menzies"],"meta":["February 2018Information and Software Technology 98(4)","DOI:10.1016/j.infsof.2018.02.005"],"references":["318873760_Easy_over_hard_a_case_study_on_deep_learning","318123270_Trends_in_Topics_at_SE_Conferences_1993-2013","312468318_What_are_mobile_developers_asking_about_A_large_scale_study_using_stack_overflow","312467856_An_exploratory_analysis_of_mobile_development_issues_using_stack_overflow","312368551_A_comparative_study_of_differential_evolution_particle_swarm_optimization_and_evolutionary_algorithms_on_numerical_benchmark_problems","311532789_Latent_dirichlet_allocation","310821310_Effort-aware_just-in-time_defect_prediction_simple_unsupervised_models_could_be_better_than_supervised_models","310589501_Analysis_of_user_comments_An_approach_for_software_requirements_evolution","306939383_The_magical_number_seven_plus_or_minus_two_Some_limits_on_our_capacity_to_process_information","305660880_Exploring_topic_models_in_software_engineering_data_analysis_A_survey"]}
