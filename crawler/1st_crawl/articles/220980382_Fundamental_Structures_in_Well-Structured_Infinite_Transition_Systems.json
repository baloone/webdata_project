{"id":"220980382_Fundamental_Structures_in_Well-Structured_Infinite_Transition_Systems","abstract":". We suggest a simple and clean definition for Well-StructuredTransition Systems [Fin90,A CJY96], a general class of infinite state systemsfor which decidability results exist. As a consequence we can (1)generalize the definition in many ways, (2) find examples of (general)WSTS's in many fields, and (3) present new decidability results.IntroductionFormal verification of programs and systems is a very active field for both theoreticalresearch and practical developments, especially since...","authors":["Alain Finkel","Ph.
