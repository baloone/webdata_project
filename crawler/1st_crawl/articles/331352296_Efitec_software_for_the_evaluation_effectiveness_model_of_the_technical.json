{"id":"331352296_Efitec_software_for_the_evaluation_effectiveness_model_of_the_technical","abstract":"Nowadays sports levels are increased to a high degree thanks to the use of tools and instruments that combine the use of technology with the sciences applied to sports. Football is not the exception; thanks to these technological and scientific advances it has been possible to improve not only the sports performance but also the way in which each one of the factors that determine the sport form is controlled. In Colombia today, you can optimize football through specialized software that allows you to measure, quantify, plan and organize the tasks and means of this sport. For this reason, this study aims to design an application that allows measuring the level of technical effectiveness of the shot on goal in football. This will help to improve sports performance and thus increase technical levels, allowing a better planning of the daily structures of sports training and thus contribute to the improvement of this sport by optimizing the times and the easy handling of technology, computer science and more important the results in the competition.","authors":["Rony David Merchan Osorio","Jairo Florez","William Fernando Caro Cely","Javier Andres Verdugo-Acevedo"],"meta":["January 2019Journal of Physics Conference Series 1161(1):012017","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/1161/1/012017","Project: Soccer teaching methods in sports training schools in Tunja, Boyac√°"],"references":["44471620_La_accion_tactica_en_el_juego_Friedrich_Mahlo"]}
