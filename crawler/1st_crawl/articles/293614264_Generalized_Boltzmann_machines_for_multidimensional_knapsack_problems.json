{"id":"293614264_Generalized_Boltzmann_machines_for_multidimensional_knapsack_problems","abstract":"Boltzmann machines (BM) have been proposed as a massively parallel alternative to the sequential simulated annealing algorithm for optimization problems. These machines have been very successfully applied to the TSP and some specific problems in graph theory. In this paper we show the limitations of the existing BM and its inapplicability (in its present form) to certain problems in optimization. We then develop a generalized Boltzmann machine (GBM), based on higher order networks, and establish a mapping of the multidimensional knapsack problem onto this machine. The simulation results indicate that the working of GBM is similar to that of BM of order 2. However, the range of applicability of the BM is vastly increased because of this generalization.","authors":["Shivakumar Vaithyanathan","Haluk Öğmen","James P.
