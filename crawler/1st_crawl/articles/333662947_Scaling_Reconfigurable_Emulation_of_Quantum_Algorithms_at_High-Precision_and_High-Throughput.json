{"id":"333662947_Scaling_Reconfigurable_Emulation_of_Quantum_Algorithms_at_High-Precision_and_High-Throughput","abstract":"The general approach for emulating quantum algorithms on classical platforms has been through representing them as gate‐based quantum circuits. However, direct implementation of quantum circuits significantly increases the hardware resource utilization and system latency of classical emulators. In this paper, we investigate multiple implementation models alternative to conventional emulation approaches, as feasible solutions to the scalability problem in classical emulation of quantum circuits. In the first model, the quantum circuit functionality is reduced to equivalent, arithmetic (multiply‐and‐accumulate) operations and combined with two computation methods, based on look‐up and dynamic generation. In the second model, a kernel operation is extracted from the quantum circuit based on its functionality, and the kernel is iterated through all input quantum states. The proposed emulation models provide space and time optimizations, significantly reducing resource utilizations and latencies and improving scalability. We use these models to develop a highly scalable hardware emulator that is based on reconfigurable technology for efficient simulations of full quantum algorithms and circuits. Our hardware implementations support single precision floating point arithmetic for improved accuracy, and contain fully pipelined designs for high throughput. We investigate quantum algorithms such as Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) and Quantum Wavelet Transform (QWT) and explore different hardware architectures and optimizations. Experimental results and analysis are provided for the architectures in terms of resource consumption and emulation time. The experiments are carried out on a high‐performance reconfigurable computing (HPRC) system and the obtained results show that the proposed emulator is feasible for running and testing a variety of quantum algorithms.","authors":["Naveed Mahmud","Esam El-Araby","David Caliga"],"meta":["June 2019Quantum Engineering 1(2)","DOI:10.1002/que2.19"],"references":["331097538_Quantum_Algorithm_Design_Techniques_and_Applications","329686075_An_FPGA-based_real_quantum_computer_emulator","327702519_The_multi-level_and_multi-dimensional_quantum_wavelet_packet_transforms","327119007_Large-scale_silicon_quantum_photonics_implementing_arbitrary_two-qubit_processing","323355637_QuEST_and_High_Performance_Simulation_of_Quantum_Computers","323302402_64-Qubit_Quantum_Circuit_Simulation","322498402_18-qubit_entanglement_with_photon's_three_degrees_of_freedom","322243414_Quantum_Computing_in_the_NISQ_era_and_beyond","321263617_FPGA_quantum_computing_emulator_using_high_level_design_tools","320321675_NMRCloudQ_A_Quantum_Cloud_Experience_on_a_Nuclear_Magnetic_Resonance_Quantum_Computer","317701045_A_New_Quantum_Watermarking_Based_on_Quantum_Wavelet_Transforms","310953357_Quantum_Enhanced_Inference_in_Markov_Logic_Networks","305780465_Characterizing_Quantum_Supremacy_in_Near-Term_Devices","304163885_Secure_Quantum_Processing_by_Remote_Control","300088815_An_FPGA-Based_Quantum_Computing_Emulation_Framework_Based_on_Serial-Parallel_Architecture","261236269_GPU-aware_Distributed_Quantum_Simulation","226754042_The_computer_as_a_physical_system_A_microscopic_quantum_mechanical_Hamiltonian_model_of_computers_as_represented_by_Turing_machines","222520863_Massive_Parallel_Quantum_Computer_Simulator","221798863_Realization_of_Three-Qubit_Quantum_Error_Correction_with_Superconducting_Circuits","220790418_FPGA-Based_Circuit_Model_Emulation_of_Quantum_Algorithms","45918850_Obtaining_the_Quantum_Fourier_Transform_from_the_Classical_FFT_with_QRDecomposition","4099069_FPGA_emulation_of_quantum_circuits","2203248_Quantum_Wavelet_Transforms_Fast_Algorithms_and_Complete_Circuits","2197222_The_General_Quantum_Interference_Principle_and_the_Duality_Computer","331609955_Towards_Higher_Scalability_of_Quantum_Hardware_Emulation_Using_Efficient_Resource_Scheduling","330689334_Mathematics_of_quantum_computation","330540069_A_Scalable_High-Precision_and_High-Throughput_Architecture_for_Emulation_of_Quantum_Algorithms","328052663_Towards_Higher_Scalability_of_Quantum_Hardware_Emulation_using_Efficient_Resource_Scheduling","328052575_A_Scalable_High-Precision_and_High-Throughput_Architecture_for_Emulation_of_Quantum_Algorithms","324144844_Quantum_computing_Both_here_and_not_here","319534430_Passive_quantum_error_correction_of_linear_optics_networks_through_error_averaging","291942453_Simulating_Physics_with_Computers","288806024_Assessing_Productivity_of_High-Level_Design_Methodologies_for_High-Performance_Reconfigurable_Computers","283864481_An_Accurate_FPGA-Based_Hardware_Emulation_on_Quantum_Fourier_Transform","280821144_Polynomial-Time_Algorithms_for_Prime_Factorization_and_Discrete_Logarithms_on_a_Quantum_Computer","265564295_Quantum_Computation_and_Quantum_Information_10th_Anniversary_Edition","261310592_Parallel_quantum_computer_simulation_on_the_GPU","258845735_Massively_parallel_quantum_computer_simulator","237243628_Quantum_Theory_the_Church-Turing_Principle_and_the_Universal_Quantum_Computer","228109531_Rapid_Solution_of_Problems_by_Quantum_Computation","226810696_Simulating_physics_with_computers_Int_J_Theor_Phys_2167467-488","220694501_Quantum_Computing_for_Computer_Scientists","220426448_A_Method_for_Obtaining_Digital_Signatures_and_Public-Key_Cryptosystems","220426289_A_Method_for_Obtaining_Digital_Signatures_and_Public-Key_Cryptosystems","220243579_Reconfigurable_processing_for_satellite_on-board_automatic_cloud_cover_assessment","13375764_Shor_P_W_Scheme_for_reducing_decoherence_in_quantum_computer_memory_Phys_Rev_A_52_R2493-R2496","4060743_FPGA-based_high-speed_emulator_of_quantum_computing","2818380_Polynomial-Time_Algorithms_For_Prime_Factorization_And_Discrete_Logarithms_On_A_Quantum_Computer","2201607_Fast_quantum_mechanical_algorithm_for_database_search"]}
