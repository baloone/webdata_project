{"id":"241010750_On_a_Problem_of_Formal_Logic","abstract":"This paper is primarily concerned with a special case of one of the leading problems of mathematical logic, the problem of\nfinding a regular procedure to determine the truth or falsity of any given logical formula*. But in the course of this investigation\nit is necessary to use certain theorems on combinations which have an independent interest and are most conveniently set out\nby themselves beforehand.","authors":["F.
