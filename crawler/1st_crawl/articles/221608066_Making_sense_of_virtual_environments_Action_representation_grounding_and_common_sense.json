{"id":"221608066_Making_sense_of_virtual_environments_Action_representation_grounding_and_common_sense","abstract":"The development of complex interactive 3D systems raises the need for representations supporting more abstract descriptions of world objects, their behaviour and the world dynamics. The inclusion of Artificial Intelligence representations and their use within 3D graphic worlds face both fundamental and technical issues due to the difference in representational logic between computer graphics and knowledge-based systems. We present a framework for such an integration illustrated by a first prototype.","authors":["Jean-Luc Lugrin","Marc Cavazza"],"meta":["January 2007","DOI:10.1145/1216295.1216336","SourceDBLP","Conference: Proceedings of the 2007 International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces, January 28-31, 2007, Honolulu, Hawaii, USA"],"references":["284687064_Applying_Artificial_Intelligence_to_Virtual_Reality_Intelligent_Virtual_Environments","278232144_Game_engines_in_scientific_research","232625844_Coupling_Ontologies_with_Graphics_Content_for_Knowledge_Driven_Visualization","228722611_Designing_semantic_virtual_reality_applications","228714912_Interactive_landmarks_Linking_virtual_environments_with_knowledge-based_systems","292661139_Commonsense-Based_interfaces","246988451_Object_structure_and_action_requirements_A_compatibility_model_for_functional_recognition","234804865_Naive_Physics_I_Ontology_For_Liquids","223714484_Understanding_Natural_Language","222555786_Modeling_Behaviors_of_Interactive_Objects_for_Real-Time_Virtual_Environments"]}
