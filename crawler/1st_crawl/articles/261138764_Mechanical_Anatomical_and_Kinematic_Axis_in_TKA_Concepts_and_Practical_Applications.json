{"id":"261138764_Mechanical_Anatomical_and_Kinematic_Axis_in_TKA_Concepts_and_Practical_Applications","abstract":"Successful total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has often been based on the restoration of the knee to neutral alignment postoperatively. Numerous reports have linked malaligned TKA components to increased wear, poor functional outcomes, and failure. There have been many different alignment philosophies and surgical techniques that have been established to attain the goal of proper alignment, which includes such techniques as computerized navigation, and custom cutting guides. In addition, these methods could potentially have the added benefit of leading to improved functional outcomes following total knee arthroplasty. In this report, we have reviewed and analyzed recent reports concerning mechanical, anatomic, and kinematic axis/alignment schemes used in total knee arthroplasty.","authors":["Jeffrey Jai Cherian","Bhaveen H Kapadia","Samik Banerjee","Julio J.
