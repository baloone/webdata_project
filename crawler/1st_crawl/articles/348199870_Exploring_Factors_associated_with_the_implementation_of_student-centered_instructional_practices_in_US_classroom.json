{"id":"348199870_Exploring_Factors_associated_with_the_implementation_of_student-centered_instructional_practices_in_US_classroom","abstract":"This study explored school- and teacher-level factors associated with a higher probability of teachersâ€™ implementation of student-centered instructional practices. These practices include adaptive instruction and active teaching strategies that support learning enhanced by information communication technology (ICT), collaborative small-group learning, and project-based learning. We used data from the U.S. sample in the Teaching and Learning International Survey (TALIS) 2013, which consisted of 1112 teachers from 89 public schools. Results showed that teacher participating in professional development (PD) in ICT and approaches to individualized learning, receiving student feedback, and student assessments were related to a higher level of implementing student-centered instruction.","authors":["Ling Zhang","James D.
