{"id":"261762020_Sum-of-squares_proofs_and_the_quest_toward_optimal_algorithms","abstract":"In order to obtain the best-known guarantees, algorithms are traditionally\ntailored to the particular problem we want to solve. Two recent developments,\nthe Unique Games Conjecture (UGC) and the Sum-of-Squares (SOS) method,\nsurprisingly suggest that this tailoring is not necessary and that a single\nefficient algorithm could achieve best possible guarantees for a wide range of\ndifferent problems.\nThe Unique Games Conjecture (UGC) is a tantalizing conjecture in\ncomputational complexity, which, if true, will shed light on the complexity of\na great many problems. In particular this conjecture predicts that a single\nconcrete algorithm provides optimal guarantees among all efficient algorithms\nfor a large class of computational problems.\nThe Sum-of-Squares (SOS) method is a general approach for solving systems of\npolynomial constraints. This approach is studied in several scientific\ndisciplines, including real algebraic geometry, proof complexity, control\ntheory, and mathematical programming, and has found applications in fields as\ndiverse as quantum information theory, formal verification, game theory and\nmany others.\nWe survey some connections that were recently uncovered between the Unique\nGames Conjecture and the Sum-of-Squares method. In particular, we discuss new\ntools to rigorously bound the running time of the SOS method for obtaining\napproximate solutions to hard optimization problems, and how these tools give\nthe potential for the sum-of-squares method to provide new guarantees for many\nproblems of interest, and possibly to even refute the UGC.","authors":["Boaz Barak","David Steurer"],"meta":["April 2014","SourcearXiv"],"references":["256079535_Linear_Lower_Bound_on_Degrees_of_Positivstellensatz_Calculus_Proofs_for_the_Parity","242371169_Cones_of_Matrices_and_Set-Functions_and_0-1_Optimization","233970656_Difference_Equations_Isoperimetric_Inequality_and_Transience_of_Certain_Random_Walks","220532729_A_Hierarchy_of_Relaxations_Between_the_Continuous_and_Convex_Hull_Representations_for_Zero-One_Programming_Problems","14562158_Emergence_of_simple-cell_receptive_field_properties_by_learning_a_sparse_code_for_natural_images","340681764_Independent_component_analysis_A_new_concept","267147531_On_Khot's_unique_games_conjecture","265618277_Semidefinite_optimization_and_convex_algebraic_geometry","261267743_Making_the_Long_Code_Shorter","259441113_Rounding_Sum-of-Squares_Relaxations","258144696_Learning_Sparsely_Used_Overcomplete_Dictionaries_via_Alternating_Minimization","257410005_Recovering_the_Sparsest_Element_in_a_Subspace","256844574_Resume_de_la_theorie_metrique_des_produits_tensoriels_topologiques","256844553_Resume_de_la_Theorie_Metrique_des_Produits_Tensoriels_Topologiques","256187047_New_Algorithms_for_Learning_Incoherent_and_Overcomplete_Dictionaries","252239678_Complexity_of_Null-and_Positivstellensatz_Proofs","251351298_Clique_is_hard_to_approximate_within","245766163_Cones_of_Matrices_and_Set-Functions_and_0-1_Optimization","245015335_An_approach_to_obtaining_global_extrema_in_polynomial_mathematical_programming_problems","243767082_Squared_Functional_Systems_and_Optimization_Problems","242855762_Structured_Semidenite_Programs_and_Semialgebraic_Geometry_Methods_in_Robustness_and_Optimization","242396851_A_lower_bound_for_the_smallest_eigenvalue_of_the_Laplacian","241689157_Fourier_PCA","239067087_l1_Isoperimetric_inequalities_for_graphs_and_superconcentrators","236871476_The_Unique_Games_Conjecture_Integrality_Gap_for_Cut_Problems_and_Embeddability_of_Negative-Type_Metrics_into_l_1","232276175_Convergence_of_SDP_hierarchies_for_polynomial_optimization_on_the_hypersphere","228659739_Inapproximability_of_NP-complete_Problems_Discrete_Fourier_Analysis_and_Geometry","228060130_Exact_Recovery_of_Sparsely-Used_Dictionaries","226134487_Decomposition_of_the_completer-graph_into_completer-partiter-graphs","225981807_A_Nullstellensatz_and_a_Positivstellensatz_in_semialgebraic_geometry","225781025_Uber_die_Zerlegung_definiter_Funktionen_in_Quadrate","225116248_Anneaux_preordonnes","225027404_Hypercontractivity_Sum-of-Squares_Proofs_and_their_Applications","224354145_Linear_Level_Lasserre_Lower_Bounds_for_Certain_k-CSPs","224127275_Integrality_gaps_for_strong_SDP_relaxations_of_UNIQUE_GAMES","222923068_Strong_computational_lower_bounds_via_parameterized_complexity","222307097_Fixed-Parameter_Tractability_and_Completeness_II_On_Completeness_for_W1","221590714_Optimal_algorithms_and_inapproximability_results_for_every_CSP","221590314_Graph_expansion_and_the_unique_games_conjecture","221580532_On_the_Unique_Games_Conjecture_Invited_Survey","221498892_Subexponential_Algorithms_for_Unique_Games_and_Related_Problems","221498216_SDP_Integrality_Gaps_with_Local_ell_1-Embeddability","220779673_Fast_SDP_Algorithms_for_Constraint_Satisfaction_Problems","220779568_Towards_Computing_the_Grothendieck_Constant","220617985_Inapproximability_Results_for_Maximum_Edge_Biclique_Minimum_Linear_Arrangement_and_Sparsest_Cut","220268404_Approximations_for_the_isoperimetric_and_spectral_profile_of_graphs_and_related_parameters","220138378_CSP_Gaps_and_Reductions_in_the_Lasserre_Hierarchy","3948668_On_the_power_of_unique_2-prover_1-round_games","3921088_Improved_inapproximability_results_for_MaxClique_chromatic_number_and_approximate_graph_coloring","2916083_Expander_Flows_Geometric_Embeddings_and_Graph_Partitioning","2616595_Global_Optimization_With_Polynomials_And_The_Problem_Of_Moments","2521821_A_Comparison_of_the_Sherali-Adams_Lovasz-Schrijver_and_Lasserre_Relaxations_for_0-1_Programming","2457699_0878_approximation_algorithms_for_MAX_CUT_and_MAX_2-SAT_Proc_26th_ACM_Symp_Theory_Comput1994_422-431_Updated_as_Improved_approximation_algorithms_for_maximum_cut_and_satisfiability_problems_using_semi","2261588_Some_Concrete_Aspects_Of_Hilbert's_17th_Problem"]}
