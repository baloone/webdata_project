{"id":"271225749_Stable-_P_partitions_of_graphs","abstract":"For a set of graphs , the Stable- problem asks whether, given a graph , we can find an independent set in , such that . For instance, if is the set of all bipartite graphs, Stable- coincides with vertex 3-colourability, and if is the set of 1-regular graphs, the problem is known as efficient edge domination. Numerous other examples of the Stable- problem have been studied in the literature. In the present contribution, we systematically study the Stable- problem with respect to the speed (a term meaning size) of . In particular, we show that for all hereditary classes with a subfactorial speed of growth, Stable- is solvable in polynomial time. We then explore the problem for minimal hereditary factorial classes . Contrary to the conjecture proposed in Lozin (2005) [18], the complexity of Stable- turns out to be polynomial for nearly all minimal hereditary factorial classes . On the other hand, if we do not require to be hereditary, the complexity of the problem can jump to NP-completeness.","authors":["Konrad Kazimierz Dabrowski","Vadim Lozin","Juraj Stacho"],"meta":["February 2015Discrete Applied Mathematics 182","DOI:10.1016/j.dam.2013.07.001"],"references":["243133956_On_P4-transversals_of_perfect_graphs","222174279_The_complexity_of_some_problems_related_to_Graph_3-colorability","220532802_Retractions_to_Pseudoforests","220200533_New_Results_on_Generalized_Graph_Coloring","220194609_Bisplit_Graphs","220112216_The_NP-completeness_of_1r-subcolorability_of_cubic_graphs","2393514_List_Partitions","265706191_On_the_computational_complexity_of_OP-partition_problems","265368244_Lower_levels_of_the_lattice_of_hereditary_classes_of_graphs","251082719_On_P4-transversals_of_chordal_graphs","248087310_Threshold_Graphs_and_Related_Topics","227842573_A_Generalization_of_Perfect_Graphs-i-Perfect_Graphs","222647696_The_Speed_of_Hereditary_Properties_of_Graphs","222646839_Partitioning_chordal_graphs_into_independent_sets_and_cliques","222057470_Some_Simplified_NP-Complete_Graph_Problems","220695890_Computers_and_Intracdtability_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness","220618257_Node-Deletion_Problems_on_Bipartite_Graphs","220567257_A_note_on_the_computational_complexity_of_graph_vertex_partition","220115381_Efficient_Edge_Domination_Problems_in_Graphs","220114517_Between_2-_and_3-colorability","49457488_Partitioning_graphs_into_complete_and_empty_graphs","37423615_Partitioning_cographs_into_cliques_and_stable_sets"]}
