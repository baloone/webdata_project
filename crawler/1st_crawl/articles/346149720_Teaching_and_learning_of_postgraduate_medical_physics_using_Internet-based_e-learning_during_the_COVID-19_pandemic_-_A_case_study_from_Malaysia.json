{"id":"346149720_Teaching_and_learning_of_postgraduate_medical_physics_using_Internet-based_e-learning_during_the_COVID-19_pandemic_-_A_case_study_from_Malaysia","abstract":"Purpose\nWe present the implementation of e-learning in the Master of Medical Physics programme at the University of Malaya during a partial lockdown from March to June 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMethods\nTeaching and Learning (T&L) activities were conducted virtually on e-learning platforms. The students' experience and feedback were evaluated after 15 weeks.\n\nResults\nWe found that while students preferred face-to-face, physical teaching, they were able to adapt to the new norm of e-learning. More than 60% of the students agreed that pre-recorded lectures and viewing videos of practical sessions, plus answering short questions, were beneficial. Certain aspects, such as hands-on practical and clinical experience, could never be replaced. The e-learning and study-from-home environment accorded a lot of flexibility. However, students also found it challenging to focus because of distractions, lack of engagement and mental stress. Technical problems, such as poor Internet connectivity and limited data plans, also compounded the problem.\n\nConclusion\nWe expect e-learning to prevail in future. Hybrid learning strategies, which includes face-to-face classes and e-learning, will become common, at least in the medical physics programme of the University of Malaya even after the pandemic.","authors":["Che A Azlan","Jeannie Hsiu Ding Wong","Li Kuo Tan","Muhammad Shahrun Nizam A.D.
