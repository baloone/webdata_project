{"id":"48192034_Characteristic_Generators_and_Dualization_for_Tail-Biting_Trellises","abstract":"This paper focuses on dualizing tail-biting trellises, particularly\nKV-trellises. These trellises are based on characteristic generators, as\nintroduced by Koetter/Vardy (2003), and may be regarded as a natural\ngeneralization of minimal conventional trellises, even though they are not\nnecessarily minimal. Two dualization techniques will be investigated: the local\ndualization, introduced by Forney (2001) for general normal graphs, and a\nlinear algebra based dualization tailored to the specific class of tail-biting\nBCJR-trellises, introduced by Nori/Shankar (2006). It turns out that, in\ngeneral, the BCJR-dual is a subtrellis of the local dual, while for\nKV-trellises these two coincide. Furthermore, making use of both the\nBCJR-construction and the local dualization, it will be shown that for each\ncomplete set of characteristic generators of a code there exists a complete set\nof characteristic generators of the dual code such that their resulting\nKV-trellises are dual to each other if paired suitably. This proves a stronger\nversion of a conjecture formulated by Koetter/Vardy.","authors":["Heide Gluesing-Luerssen","Elizabeth A.
