{"id":"357033090_Artificial_Intelligence_AI_And_Autism_Spectrum_Disorder_ASD_Literature_review","abstract":"This article presents a broad writing survey of innovation based intervention systems for individuals confronting autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Investigated approaches include, \"computer vision assisted technologies(CVAT), contemporary computer aided systems(CAS), and visual reality (VR) or artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted interventions \". The research over the previous decade has provided enough showings that individuals with ASD have a strong interest in innovation based interventions, which are valuable in both, clinical settings just as at home and classrooms. Regardless of showing extraordinary guarantee, research in fostering a trend setting innovation based intervention that is clinically quantitative for ASD is minimal. Also, the clinicians are not persuaded about the capability of the technology based interventions because of non-observational nature of distributed outcomes. A significant explanation for this absence of agreeableness is that a greater part of studies on distinct intervention methodologies don't observe a particular guideline or research design. We concluded from our findings that there stays a gap between the research community of computer science, psychology and neuroscience to foster an AI assisted technology for individuals experiencing ASD. Following the improvement of a standardized AI assisted interventional technology, a data base should be developed, to devise effective AI algorithms.","authors":["Maged Mahmoud Nasr","Mohamed Mahmood Nasr","Lamia H Shehata"],"meta":["November 2021","Project: Artificial Intelligence (AI) And Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)"],"references":["354430214_Facial_expression_synthesis_based_on_similar_faces","354357747_Beyond_Face_Value_Evidence_for_the_Universality_of_Bodily_Expressions_of_Emotion","353502022_Supporting_Social_Play_Skill_Acquisition_and_Generalization_of_Children_with_Autism_Through_Video_Modeling","345990199_Social_Skills_Training_for_Autism_Spectrum_Disorder_a_Meta-analysis_of_In-person_and_Technological_Interventions","342913163_Development_and_Feasibility_of_MindChip_A_Social_Emotional_Telehealth_Intervention_for_Autistic_Adults","355757764_Deep_learning_for_neuroimaging-based_diagnosis_and_rehabilitation_of_Autism_Spectrum_Disorder_A_review","354148191_Elucidating_the_neural_correlates_of_emotion_recognition_in_children_with_sub-clinical_anxiety","353105178_Follow_the_white_robot_Efficacy_of_robot-assistive_training_for_children_with_autism_spectrum_disorder","352927797_Transcranial_Direct_Current_Stimulation_tDCS_Improves_Empathy_and_Recognition_of_Facial_Emotions_Conveying_Threat_in_Adults_with_Autism_Spectrum_Disorder_ASD_A_Randomized_Controlled_Pilot_Study","349723695_Autismus-Spektrum-Storung","341489675_Identity_Impairment_as_a_Central_Dimension_in_Personality_Pathology","335905638_Randomized_Controlled_Trial_Evaluation_of_ABA_Content_on_IQ_Gains_in_Children_with_Autism","330812567_A_review_of_screening_tools_for_the_identification_of_autism_spectrum_disorders_and_developmental_delay_in_infants_and_young_children_recommendations_for_use_in_low-_and_middle-income_countries","329613236_A_Systematic_Review_of_Ayres_Sensory_Integration_Intervention_for_Children_with_Autism","331753040_Autism_spectrum_disorder_Screening_and_diagnosis"]}
