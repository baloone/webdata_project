{"id":"312113861_Studying_and_comparing_the_free_e-learning_platforms","abstract":"E-learning platforms are constantly changing; they have transformed the everyday life of teachers and students. An e-learning platforms study, from a methodical, systemic approach that identifies the dimensions, specifications and the essential criteria for the evaluation of these platforms is necessary. In this paper, we propose an analytical study of free e-learning platforms. Four platforms have been selected according to requested criteria filter among the 600 platforms listed in the THOT CURSUS directory. Subsequently, we make a comparative study of these platforms. On the one hand, we would like to measure the degree of adequacy between technological opportunities they offer and the pedagogical presuppositions of training. On the other hand, for clarifying and supporting the users in their choice of the most suitable platform for their needs so that they can benefit to the maximum of potential offered by technologies in pedagogy, and approach the problematic of the platform choice for a better pedagogy.","authors":["Ouadoud Mohammed","Mohamed Yassin Chkouri","Amel Nejjari","kamal eddine el kadiri"],"meta":["October 2016","DOI:10.1109/CIST.2016.7804953","Conference: 2016 4th IEEE International Colloquium on Information Science and Technology (CIST)"],"references":["292671908_Studying_and_Analyzing_the_Evaluation_Dimensions_of_E-learning_Platforms_Relying_on_a_Software_Engineering_Approach","265847859_L'evaluation_de_documents_multimedias_etat_de_l'art","220879118_Empirical_Development_of_a_Heuristic_Evaluation_Methodology_for_Shared_Workspace_Groupware","43642930_User_Interface_Design_and_Evaluation","43606087_Evaluation_ergonomique_des_interfaces_homme-machine_use_revue_de_la_literature","36380886_Utilite_utilisabilite_acceptabilite_interpreter_les_relations_entre_trois_dimensions_de_l'evaluation_des_EIAH","269495896_The_Psychology_of_Everyday_Things","221516639_Preliminary_findings_on_the_effectiveness_of_ergonomic_criteria_for_the_evaluation_of_human-computer_interfaces","220691714_Designing_the_user_interface_Strategies_for_effective_human-computer_interaction","220302427_Cognitive_Engineering_Principles_for_Enhancing_Human-Computer_Performance"]}
