{"id":"350130549_Integrating_social_and_cognitive_aspects_of_belief_dynamics_towards_a_unifying_framework","abstract":"Belief change and spread have been studied in many disciplines—from psychology, sociology, economics and philosophy, to biology, computer science and statistical physics—but we still do not have a firm grasp on why some beliefs change more easily and spread faster than others. To fully capture the complex social-cognitive system that gives rise to belief dynamics, we first review insights about structural components and processes of belief dynamics studied within different disciplines. We then outline a unifying quantitative framework that enables theoretical and empirical comparisons of different belief dynamic models. This framework uses a statistical physics formalism, grounded in cognitive and social theory, as well as empirical observations. We show how this framework can be used to integrate extant knowledge and develop a more comprehensive understanding of belief dynamics.","authors":["Mirta Galesic","Henrik Olsson","Jonas Dalege","Tamara van der Does"],"meta":["March 2021Journal of The Royal Society Interface 18(176)","DOI:10.1098/rsif.2020.0857"],"references":["341317328_Adaptive_social_networks_promote_the_wisdom_of_crowds","341063536_Applying_an_attitude_network_approach_to_consumer_behaviour_towards_plastic","337689412_Markov_versus_quantum_dynamic_models_of_belief_change_during_evidence_monitoring","336952483_Social_and_Economic_Networks","335422240_The_influence_of_social_interaction_on_the_dynamics_of_employees'_psychological_contracting_in_digitally_transforming_organizations","333890073_Reality-inspired_voter_models_A_mini-review","349411617_Election_polling_is_not_dead_A_Bayesian_bootstrap_method_yields_accurate_forecasts","345702449_The_Structure_and_Dynamics_of_Networks","345325342_A_Weighted_Balance_Model_of_Opinion_Hyperpolarization","344485006_The_Adaptive_Decision_Maker"]}
