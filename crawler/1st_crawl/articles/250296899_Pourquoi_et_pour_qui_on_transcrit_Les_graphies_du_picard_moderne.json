{"id":"250296899_Pourquoi_et_pour_qui_on_transcrit_Les_graphies_du_picard_moderne","abstract":"This article investigates the criteria for a satisfactory system for phonetic/phonemic notation according to Andr√© Martinet. The system should be carefully adjusted to the goal under consideration and the target audience. The author shows the well-foundedness of these criteria by applying them to the history of the many varied ways whereby modem Picard has been written more or less successfully from the 17th century to this day. The writer investigates specifically attempts at the phonological notation of this dialect.","authors":["Fernand CARTON"],"meta":["January 2009La Linguistique 45(1)","DOI:10.3917/ling.451.0113"],"references":[]}
