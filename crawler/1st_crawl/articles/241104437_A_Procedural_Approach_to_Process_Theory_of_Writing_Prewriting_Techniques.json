{"id":"241104437_A_Procedural_Approach_to_Process_Theory_of_Writing_Prewriting_Techniques","abstract":"Despite a historical event, such as that of a paradigm shift; from product to process, in the domain of the writing pedagogy, student- writers, having been provided with theory and rationale in vogue, are reported to have been found yet debilitated in writing. They still fail to practice the skill of writing as a rewarding process of discovering meaning. To overcome such a traumatic enigma, the approach known as that of process writing urgently needs to be systematically analyzed, described, and even contrastively compared with that of product writing. This essential prerequisite, as it has been reason- ably recommended, should indispensably abide by the sequential trilogy of approach, design and pro- cedure. The study here, accordingly, aims at elaborating on the labeled instructional activities specifi- cally allocated for the implementation of process writing. This is categorically embedded within the 'design' of the process scheme and the student-writers, if technically informed about its instructive de- tails, will hopefully turn out quite different in their writing endeavors and accomplishments. Student- writers if armed with the conducive clues of a bulk of knowledge as such are optimistically expected to successfully embark on real writing assignments; thus, actualizing the true merits and privileges of a dramatic shift in the writing pedagogy they have willingly and intelligently submitted themselves to.","authors":["Ismail Baroudy"],"meta":[],"references":["264343273_Tradition_and_Revolution_in_ESL_Teaching","234701618_Teaching_for_Understanding_in_German_Schools"]}
