{"id":"320536249_Illuminating_the_Potential_of_Edmodo_as_an_Interactive_Virtual_Learning_Platform_for_English_Language_Learning_and_Teaching","abstract":"English language acquisition is an area of study that garners a great deal of attention because stakeholders in education are continually looking for possible solutions and better pedagogical tools to make teaching and learning more effective. The emergence of e-learning and its Web 2.0 tools offer more opportunities in language application and encourage independent learning. Today, educators are urged to provide students with 21st century skills that are geared towards creativity and critical thinking and the generation of new knowledge, not merely implementing what has been taught. For English language learning and teaching, this paper aims to explore the perceptions of 3rd year Teaching English as Second Language (TESL) students at the University of Malaysia of Edmodo. It is a qualitative research study with singular focus on Edmodo, a social learning platform with over 52 million users, comprised of teachers, students and parents worldwide. The findings indicate four main advantages of Edmodo in English language acquisition. These areas are 1) suitability for English language learning, 2) an interactive interface, 3) an appropriate site for assessments and 4) a ‘different’ learning experience.","authors":["Alia Mokhtar","Hisham Dzakiria"],"meta":["October 2015"],"references":["319143013_Social_networking_and_the_social_studies_for_citizenship_education","306031759_Open_Learning_The_Concept_for_Modernizing_School_Education_and_Lifelong_Learning_through_the_Combination_of_Learning_Innovations_and_Quality","267724272_EFL_Students'_Attitudes_towards_Learning_English_Language_The_Case_of_Libyan_Secondary_School_Students","349901590_Writing_Interview_Protocols_and_Conducting_Interviews_Tips_for_Students_New_to_the_Field_of_Qualitative_Research","313390246_Basics_of_qualitative_research_Grounded_theory_procedures_and_techniques","281642088_Teaching_Teachers_for_the_Future_modelling_and_exploring_immersive_personal_learning_networks","279364322_Second_Language_Acquisition","266456534_Social_networking_sites_Transparency_in_online_education","266042413_The_effectiveness_of_e-learning_for_blended_courses_in_colleges_A_multi-level_empirical_study","265086460_How_to_Design_and_Evaluate_Research_in_Education"]}
