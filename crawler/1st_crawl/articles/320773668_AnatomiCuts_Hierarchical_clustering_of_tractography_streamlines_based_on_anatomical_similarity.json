{"id":"320773668_AnatomiCuts_Hierarchical_clustering_of_tractography_streamlines_based_on_anatomical_similarity","abstract":"Diffusion MRI tractography produces massive sets of streamlines that contain a wealth of information on brain connections. The size of these datasets creates a need for automated clustering methods to group the streamlines into meaningful bundles. Conventional clustering techniques group streamlines based on their spatial coordinates. Neuroanatomists, however, define white-matter bundles based on the anatomical structures that they go through or next to, rather than their spatial coordinates. Thus we propose a similarity measure for clustering streamlines based on their position relative to cortical and subcortical brain regions. We incorporate this measure into a hierarchical clustering algorithm and compare it to a measure that relies on Euclidean distance, using data from the Human Connectome Project. We show that the anatomical similarity measure leads to a 20% improvement in the overlap of clusters with manually labeled tracts. Importantly, this is achieved without introducing any prior information from a tract atlas into the clustering algorithm, therefore without imposing the existence of any named tracts.","authors":["Viviana Siless","Ken Chang","Bruce Fischl","Anastasia Yendiki"],"meta":["November 2017NeuroImage 166","DOI:10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.10.058","Project: Diffusion MRI tractography clustering"],"references":["307792214_Deterministic_diffusion_fiber_tracking_improved_by_quantitative_anisotropy","288059792_The_White_Matter_Query_Language_A_Novel_Approach_for_Describing_Human_White_Matter_Anatomy","264867038_Automated_Tract_Extraction_via_Atlas_Based_Adaptive_Clustering","261193831_Fiber_Tract_Clustering_on_Manifolds_With_Dual_Rooted-Graphs","312911596_A_method_of_establishing_groups_of_equal_amplitude_in_plant_sociology_based_on_similarity_of_species_and_its_application_to_analyses_of_the_vegetation_on_Danish_commons","312696694_Hierarchical_Clustering_of_Tractography_Streamlines_Based_on_Anatomical_Similarity","284400357_Measures_of_the_Amount_of_Ecologic_Association_Between_Species","281780547_MGH-USC_Human_Connectome_Project_datasets_with_ultra-high_b-value_diffusion_MRI","262266198_Automatic_clustering_of_white_matter_fibers_in_brain_diffusion_MRI_with_an_application_to_genetics","261716175_Characterization_of_U-shape_Streamline_Fibers_Methods_and_Applications"]}
