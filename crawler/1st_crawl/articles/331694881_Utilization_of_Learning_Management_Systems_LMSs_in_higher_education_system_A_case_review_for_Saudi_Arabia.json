{"id":"331694881_Utilization_of_Learning_Management_Systems_LMSs_in_higher_education_system_A_case_review_for_Saudi_Arabia","abstract":"There is a strong global trend toward utilising Learning Management Systems (LMSs) in academic institutions as a part of their educational management system to improve the teaching and learning experience in higher education system. Most of the universities in US, UK, Canada and Australia including 28 universities of Saudi Arabia are using different LMS systems for their academic activities. All LMS systems fully depended on the existing information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure and using computer technology to use the system. This paper reviews different features of commercially available and mostly utilized modern LMS systems including a comparative analysis. A case study focused on the universities of Saudi Arabia was also carried out.","authors":["Abdulaziz Aldiab","Harun Chowdhury","Alex Kootsookos","Firoz Alam"],"meta":["February 2019Energy Procedia 160:731-737","DOI:10.1016/j.egypro.2019.02.186"],"references":["324060141_Student_and_Staff_Perceptions_of_a_Learning_Management_System_for_Blended_Learning_in_Teacher_Education","320085644_Learning_Management_Systems_on_Blended_Learning_Courses_An_Experience-Based_Observation","316370445_Prospect_of_eLearning_in_Higher_Education_Sectors_of_Saudi_Arabia_A_Review","312040914_The_Importance_of_Human_Capital_Perspective_in_the_Learning_Management_System_LMS_Decision_Making_Process_at_Universities","304610914_A_review_of_contemporary_virtual_and_remote_laboratory_implementations_observations_and_findings","324531705_Development_of_a_Remote_Laboratory_Infrastructure_and_LMS_for_Mechatronics_Distance_Education","311580719_Device_Comparability_of_Tablets_and_Computers_for_Assessment_Purposes","309113933_Learning_management_system_VECTOR","293100911_Using_Technology_Tools_to_Innovate_Assessment_Reporting_and_Teaching_Practices_in_Engineering_Education","289103223_Investigating_and_comparing_user_experiences_of_course_management_systems_BlackBoard_vs_Moodle"]}
