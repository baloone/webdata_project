{"id":"233310365_Cyber-Terror-Looming_Threat_or_Phantom_Menace_The_Framing_of_the_US_Cyber-Threat_Debate","abstract":"For some years, experts and government officials have warned of cyber-terrorism as a looming threat to national security. However, if we define cyber-terror as an attack or series of attacks that is carried out by terrorists, that instills fear by effects that are destructive or disruptive, and that has a political, religious, or ideological motivation, then none of the disruptive “cyber”-incidents of the last years qualify as examples of cyber-terrorism. So why has this fear been so persistent? Instead of trying to answer how long cyber-terror is likely to remain a fictional scenario, this paper analyses the US cyber-terror discourse from a constructivist security studies angle: It looks at how cyber-threats in general, and cyber-terror in particular are framed, and speculates on characteristics that are responsible for the rapid and considerable political impact of the widespread conceptualization of aspects of information technology as a security problem in the 1990s.","authors":["Myriam Dunn Cavelty"],"meta":["April 2008Journal of Information Technology & Politics 4(1):19-36","DOI:10.1300/J516v04n01_03"],"references":["292976966_International_Relations_and_Security_in_the_Digital_Age","344496401_Towards_a_post-hegemonic_conceptualization_of_vorld_order_reflections_on_the_relevancy_of_Ibn_Khaldun","338910174_Strategic_Information_Warfare_A_New_Face_of_War","314547307_Security_A_New_Framework_for_Analysis","313157503_Computer_attack_and_cyberterrorism_Vulnerabilities_and_policy_issues_for_congress","297469311_Reality_bytes_Cyberterrorism_and_terrorist_'use'_of_the_internet","294682610_Security_in_the_information_age","292976902_Threat_Politics_New_Perspectives_on_Security_Risk_and_Crisis_Management","292481314_The_role_of_the_state_in_securing_the_information_age_-_Challenges_and_prospects","291807160_The_Governance_of_Cyberspace_Politics_Technology_and_Global_Restructuring"]}
