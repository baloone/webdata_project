{"id":"305308328_A_Study_of_Secure_Routing_in_Mobile_Ad-Hoc_Networks","abstract":"Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) are being widely researched and it is the technology that is providing the stepping blocks for the evolution of 4G. MANET is particularly vulnerable to attacks by hackers due to its features of open medium, dynamic changing topology and its membership (i.e., nodes frequently join and leave the network), cooperative algorithms, lack of centralized monitoring and management point, and lack of a clear line of defences etc. The traditional way of protecting networks with firewalls and encryption software is no longer sufficient and effective for MANETs. Therefore security is the major issue in MANETs. In this paper, we study Secure Ad-hoc Routing of MANETs and survey problems associated with Ad-hoc routing and the proposed solutions to the problems in Ad-hoc routing.","authors":["Akshai Aggarwal","Savita Gandhi","Nirbhay Chaubey"],"meta":["December 2008","Conference: National Conference on Advancement in Wireless Technologyand Applications (AWTA-2008)At: SVNIT, Surat, Gujarat, India","Project: Security in Mobile Cloud Computing Environment"],"references":["221628511_Security-Aware_ad-hoc_routing_for_wireless_networks","220926268_Multicast_Operation_of_the_Ad-Hoc_On-Demand_Distance_Vector_Routing_Protocol","37402364_The_Quest_for_Security_in_Mobile_Ad_Hoc_Networks","3943552_Optimized_Link_State_Routing_Protocol_for_Ad_Hoc_Networks","3282731_Securing_Ad_Hoc_Networks","243476393_Mobile_Ad_Hoc_Networking_MANET_Routing_Protocol_Performance_Issues_and_Evaluation_Considerations","239052893_The_Dynamic_Source_Routing_Protocol_for_Mobile_Ad_Hoc_Networks","4004135_A_Secure_Routing_Protocol_for_Ad_Hoc_Networks","3344051_A_Review_of_Current_Routing_Protocols_for_Ad-Hoc_Mobile_Wireless_Networks","3282865_Scalable_routing_protocols_for_mobile_Ad_Hoc_networks"]}
