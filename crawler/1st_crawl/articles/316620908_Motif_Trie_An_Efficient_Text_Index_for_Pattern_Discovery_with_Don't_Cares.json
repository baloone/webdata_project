{"id":"316620908_Motif_Trie_An_Efficient_Text_Index_for_Pattern_Discovery_with_Don't_Cares","abstract":"We introduce the motif trie data structure, which has applications in pattern\nmatching and discovery in genomic analysis, plagiarism detection, data mining,\nintrusion detection, spam fighting and time series analysis, to name a few. Here\nthe extraction of recurring patterns in sequential and textual data is one of the\nmain computational bottlenecks. For this, we address the problem of extracting\nmaximal patterns with at most k donâ€™t care symbols and at least q occurrences,\naccording to a maximality notion we define. We apply the motif trie to this\nproblem, also showing how to build it efficiently. As a result, we give the first\nalgorithm that attains a stronger notion of output-sensitivity, where the cost\nfor an input sequence of n symbols is proportional to the actual number of\noccurrences of each pattern, which is at most n (much smaller in practice). This\navoids the best-known cost of O(nc) per pattern, for constant c > 1, which is\notherwise impractical for massive sequences with large n","authors":["Roberto Grossi","Giulia Menconi","Nadia Pisanti","Roberto Trani"],"meta":["May 2017Theoretical Computer Science","DOI:10.1016/j.tcs.2017.04.012","Project: Motifs Bases"],"references":["302593972_Circular_sequence_comparison_Algorithms_and_applications","266661936_Output-sensitive_pattern_extraction_in_sequences","316928083_Copy_Detection_Mechanisms_for_Digital_Documents","288401872_Maximal_pattern_matching_with_flexible_wildcard_gaps_and_one-off_constraint","273026675_Circular_Pattern_Discovery","260608339_Irredundant_tandem_motifs","259510192_RIME_Repeat_identification","253610113_String_Mining_in_Bioinformatics","248779657_Fast_algorithms_for_finding_nearest_common_ancestor","234825122_Copy_detection_mechanisms_for_digital_documents"]}
