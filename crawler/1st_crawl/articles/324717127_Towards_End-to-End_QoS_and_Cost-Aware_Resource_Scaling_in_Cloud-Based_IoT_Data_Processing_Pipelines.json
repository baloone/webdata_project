{"id":"324717127_Towards_End-to-End_QoS_and_Cost-Aware_Resource_Scaling_in_Cloud-Based_IoT_Data_Processing_Pipelines","abstract":"Ensuring cost-effective end-to-end QoS in a multilayer, multi-service, IoT data processing pipeline is a non-trivial challenge. The uncertainties surrounding the 3Vs of streaming\ndata – variety, velocity and volume – impose dynamic QoS driven resource requirements on each component (or service) of the pipeline and make adaptive resource management a complex task. Our overall research objective is to develop appropriate resource scaling strategies that dynamically adjust the resources allocated to each component in the pipeline so as to ensure end-to-end QoS fulﬁllment while optimizing the associated costs. To this end, in this paper, we present our initial work on a model for end-to-end QoS and cost-aware resource allocation for IoT data processing pipelines. We base our model on the well-established unbounded knapsack problem, which offers a simple yet powerful abstraction of constraint-based decision-making. We intend to develop resource scaling\nstrategies on top of this model that can exploit resource and contract heterogeneity to achieve cost-optimal end-to-end QoS aware resource allocations.","authors":["Mohan Baruwal Chhetri","Sunil Singh Samant","Bao Quoc Vo","Ryszard Kowalczyk"],"meta":["April 2018","DOI:10.1109/SCC.2018.00050","Conference: 15th IEEE International Conference on Services ComputingAt: San Francisco, USA","Projects: Autonomic management of user-centric cloud services  for Smart Cities.Consumer-centric Adaptive Quality-assured Cloud Services Brokerage"],"references":["309081880_IoT_Middleware_A_Survey_on_Issues_and_Enabling_Technologies","321813781_Towards_Quality-Assured_Data_Delivery_in_Cloud-Based_IoT_Platforms_for_Smart_Cities","230531608_Establishing_Composite_SLAs_through_Concurrent_QoS_Negotiation_with_Surplus_Redistribution","220288981_Unbounded_knapsack_problem_Dynamic_programming_revisited"]}
