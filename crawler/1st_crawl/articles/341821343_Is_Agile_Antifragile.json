{"id":"341821343_Is_Agile_Antifragile","abstract":"The main issues of software project management are complexity and fragility –large projects are resistant to policy optimization and good practices. Agile is a step towards solving this problem and has been proclaimed as the best solution, as “antifragile” project management. We investigate its properties, propose necessary conditions for antifragile management (related to convexity of probability density distributions and utility functions), and compare them.\n\nPublished in:\n\nComputer Science and Education in Computer Science\nhttps://www.ceeol.com/search/article-detail?id=810558","authors":["Latchezar Tomov"],"meta":["July 2019","Project: Software quality from system perspective"],"references":["320570339_Calculating_Completeness_of_Agile_Scope_in_Scaled_Agile_Development","318415292_Peto's_Paradox_How_has_evolution_solved_the_problem_of_cancer_prevention","303028716_A_Proposal_for_an_Antifragile_Software_Manifesto","230609579_Mathematical_Definition_Mapping_and_Detection_of_AntiFragility","326475067_Measuring_the_Gains_from_Labor_Specialization_Theory_and_Evidence","247565698_Sociophysics_A_mean_behavior_model_for_the_process_of_strike","238011715_The_Unreasonable_Effectiveness_of_Mathematics_in_the_Natural_Sciences"]}
