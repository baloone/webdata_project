{"id":"259183242_Social_Simulation_in_the_Social_Sciences_A_Brief_Overview","abstract":"This article provides an overview of the social simulation approach to the study of social phenomena.\nWe focus especially on the relevance of heterogeneity of social behavior and dynamics and the\ncomplex interplay of agent behavior and social structure. The article identifies the peculiarities and\nthe explanatory achievements of this approach and then discusses its prospects and challenges.\nSpecial attention is given to (i) how micro-level behavioral detail can be used to understand social\npatterns and dynamics; (ii) the importance of the meso level of social networks; and (iii) the twoway,\nprocess linkages between micro and macro aspects as a fundamental source of social uncertainty\nand unpredictability.","authors":["Flaminio Squazzoni","Wander Jager","Bruce Edmonds"],"meta":["December 2013Social Science Computer Review 32(3)","DOI:10.1177/0894439313512975"],"references":["286163637_Put_Your_Money_Where_Your_Mouth_Is_DIAL_A_Dialogical_Model_for_Opinion_Dynamics","350190634_Agent-Based_Computational_Sociology_SquazzoniAgent-Based_Computational_Sociology","344676879_Diversity_and_Complexity","333019923_Small_Worlds_The_Dynamics_of_Networks_between_Order_and_Randomness","321291706_Simulating_Social_Complexity_A_Handbook","292581915_Cognition_and_multi-agent_interaction_From_cognitive_modeling_to_social_simulation","287917229_Complexity_and_public_policy_A_new_approach_to_twenty-first_century_politics_policy_and_society","286122528_An_Agent-Based_Social_Network_Model_of_Binge_Drinking_Among_Dutch_Adults","286061103_Social_Emergence_Societies_As_Complex_Systems","285394652_Social_Influence","284174888_Social_Relationships_and_the_Emergence_of_Social_Networks","281951331_Rejection_mechanism_in_2D_bounded_confidence_provides_more_conformity","285394558_Conclusions","285213040_Dissecting_the_Social_On_the_Principles_of_Analytic_Sociology","283617410_Emergence_of_Scaling_in_Random_Networks"]}
