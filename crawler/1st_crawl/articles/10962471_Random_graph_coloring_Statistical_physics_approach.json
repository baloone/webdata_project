{"id":"10962471_Random_graph_coloring_Statistical_physics_approach","abstract":"The problem of vertex coloring in random graphs is studied using methods of statistical physics and probability. Our analytical results are compared to those obtained by exact enumeration and Monte Carlo simulations. We critically discuss the merits and shortcomings of the various methods, and interpret the results obtained. We present an exact analytical expression for the two-coloring problem as well as general replica symmetric approximated solutions for the thermodynamics of the graph coloring problem with p colors and K-body edges.","authors":["Jort Van Mourik","David Saad"],"meta":["December 2002Physical Review E 66(5 Pt 2):056120","DOI:10.1103/PhysRevE.66.056120","SourcePubMed"],"references":["13231775_Weight_Space_Structure_and_Internal_Representations_A_Direct_Approach_to_Learning_and_Generalization_in_Multilayer_Neural_Networks","12332272_Number_of_Guards_Needed_by_a_Museum_A_Phase_Transition_in_Vertex_Covering_of_Random_Graphs","260786401_The_Potts_model","243134926_Sudden_Emergence_of_a_Giantk-Core_in_a_Random_Graph","235488498_Statistical_mechanics_of_the_random_K-SAT_model","235410255_Statistical_Physics_of_Spin_Glasses_and_Information_Processing","231044579_Graph_bipartitioning_and_spin_glasses_on_a_random_network_of_fixed_finite_valence","223688855_Frozen_development_in_graph_coloring","220342685_Almost_All_Graphs_With_2522n_Edges_Are_Not_3-Colorable","216877583_Graph_Coloring_Problems"]}
