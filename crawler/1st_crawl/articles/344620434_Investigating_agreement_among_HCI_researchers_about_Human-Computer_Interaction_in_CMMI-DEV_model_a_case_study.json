{"id":"344620434_Investigating_agreement_among_HCI_researchers_about_Human-Computer_Interaction_in_CMMI-DEV_model_a_case_study","abstract":"Do human–computer interaction (HCI) researchers agree about which HCI approaches should be used in the development of an interactive system? To address this question, we performed a study based on the engineering process areas (requirements development, technical solution, product integration, verification and validation) of the CMMI-DEV (Capability Maturity Model Integration for Development), a software engineering model commonly used in the industry. To carry out this study, a literature review was performed, a specific instrument was designed based on CMMI-DEV and interviews with 20 researchers from the HCI domain were conducted. Analyzing the interview data with monovariate and multivariate statistical approach (Multiple Correspondence Analysis - MCA), we find the greatest agreement occurred among researchers for HCI approaches that support verification and validation phases and the use of functional prototypes in some activities of the last phases of software development (technical solution and product integration). However, we identified lack of agreement among researchers regarding requirements development activities.","authors":["Taísa Guidini Gonçalves","Pierre Loslever","Káthia Marçal de Oliveira","Christophe Kolski"],"meta":["August 2020Interacting with Computers 32(1):81-100","DOI:10.1093/iwc/iwaa006"],"references":["328803939_A_Systematic_Mapping_Study_of_HCI_Practice_Research","328562402_Identifying_HCI_approaches_to_support_CMMI-DEV_for_interactive_system_development","327396284_Exploring_the_State_of_Human-centred_Design_Practice_in_Software_Development_Companies_A_Cross-Case_Analysis_of_Three_Nigerian_Software_Companies","318504274_How_to_make_the_most_of_your_human_design_considerations_for_human-machine_interactions","345649077_Correspondence_Analysis_Handbook","336736336_R_pour_la_statistique_et_la_science_des_donnees","327963857_Discrete_Data_Analysis_with_R_Visualization_and_Modeling_Techniques_for_Categorical_and_Count_Data","324354916_Applied_Multivariate_Statistical_Analysis","321621429_Human-Centered_Software_Engineering_-_Integrating_Usability_in_the_Software_Development_Lifecycle","319389252_Design_for_experience_innovation_understanding_user_experience_in_new_product_development"]}
