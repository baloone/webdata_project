{"id":"269635896_From_Causes_for_Database_Queries_to_Repairs_and_Model-Based_Diagnosis_and_Back","abstract":"In this work we establish and investigate connections between causality for\nquery answers in databases, database repairs wrt. denial constraints, and\nconsistency-based diagnosis. The first two are relatively new problems in\ndatabases, and the third one is an established subject in knowledge\nrepresentation. We show how to obtain database repairs from causes and the\nother way around. Causality problems are formulated as diagnosis problems, and\nthe diagnoses provide causes and their responsibilities. The vast body of\nresearch on database repairs can be applied to the newer problem of determining\nactual causes for query answers and their responsibilities. These connections,\nwhich are interesting per se, allow us, after a transition -inspired by\nconsistency-based diagnosis- to computational problems on hitting sets and\nvertex covers in hypergraphs, to obtain several new algorithmic and complexity\nresults for causality in databases.","authors":["Babak Salimi","Leopoldo Bertossi"],"meta":["July 2017Theory of Computing Systems 61(1)","DOI:10.1007/s00224-016-9718-9","SourcearXiv"],"references":["301844672_Causes_for_Query_Answers_from_Databases_Datalog_Abduction_and_View-Updates_The_Presence_of_Integrity_Constraints","303449356_Complexity_of_Consistent_Query_Answering_in_Databases_under_Cardinality-Based_and_Incremental_Repair_Semantics_extended_version","300621458_Dichotomies_in_the_Complexity_of_Preferred_Repairs","299681614_Provenance_Propagation_in_Complex_Queries","278413853_Query-Answer_Causality_in_Databases_Abductive_Diagnosis_and_View-Updates","276535727_Certain_query_answering_in_partially_consistent_databases","275836205_A_Modification_of_the_Halpern-Pearl_Definition_of_Causality","269416985_Appropriate_Causal_Models_and_the_Stability_of_Causation","262416292_Unifying_Causality_Diagnosis_Repairs_and_View-Updates_in_Databases","262274995_Semiring-Annotated_Data_Queries_and_Provenance","262246135_Parameterized_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Hitting_Set","261951971_Causality_in_Databases_The_Diagnosis_and_Repair_Connections","260317901_Bringing_Provenance_to_its_Full_Potential_using_Causal_Reasoning","254005769_A_dichotomy_in_the_complexity_of_deletion_propagation_with_functional_dependencies","252923167_From_Database_Repair_Programs_to_Consistent_Query_Answering_in_Classical_Logic"]}
