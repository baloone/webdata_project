{"id":"311430484_Two_New_Families_of_Two-Weight_Codes","abstract":"We construct two new infinite families of trace codes of dimension $2m$, over the ring $\\mathbb{F}_p+u\\mathbb{F}_p,$ when $p$ is an odd prime. They have the algebraic structure of abelian codes. Their Lee weight distribution is computed by using Gauss sums. By Gray mapping, we obtain two infinite families of linear $p$-ary codes of respective lengths $(p^m-1)^2$ and $2(p^m-1)^2.$ When $m$ is singly-even, the first family gives five-weight codes. When $m$ is odd, and $p\\equiv 3 \\pmod{4},$ the first family yields $p$-ary two-weight codes, which are shown to be optimal by application of the Griesmer bound. The second family consists of two-weight codes that are shown to be optimal, by the Griesmer bound, whenever $p=3$ and $m \\ge 3,$ or $p\\ge 5$ and $m\\ge 4.$ Applications to secret sharing schemes are given.","authors":["Minjia Shi","Yue Guan","Patrick Sol√©"],"meta":["December 2016IEEE Transactions on Information Theory PP(99)","DOI:10.1109/TIT.2017.2742499","Project: Trace codes over rings with few weights"],"references":["335832810_Optimal_Two-Weight_Codes_From_Trace_Codes_Over_F2uF2","311430273_Optimal_two_weight_codes_from_trace_codes_over_a_chain_ring","274012459_A_Class_of_Two-Weight_and_Three-Weight_Codes_and_Their_Applications_in_Secret_Sharing","235632401_Bounds_on_the_pr-ary_Image_of_Linear_Block_Codes_over_the_Finite_Semi-Local_Frobenius_Ring_F_prvF_pr","235632392_Systematic_Unit-Memory_Binary_Convolutional_Codes_from_Linear_Block_Codes_over_F2r_vF2r","233932955_Spectra_of_Graphs","309081987_Optimal_two_weight_codes_over_mathbbF_2umathbbF_2","309078509_Two_and_three_weight_codes_over_FpuFp","266520929_Duadic_codes_over_2_u_2","248414186_Weights_of_linear_codes_and_strongly_regular_normed_spaces","247891774_The_Geometry_of_Two-Weight_Codes","242426153_The_theory_0f_error_correcting_codes","242371333_The_Theory_of_Error_Correcting_Codes","232335000_Euler_products_cyclotomy_and_coding","226341525_Semisimple_cyclic_and_Abelian_codes_II","220909314_Covering_and_Secret_Sharing_with_Linear_Codes","51932198_Hamming_Weights_in_Irreducible_Cyclic_Codes","3085685_Secret_sharing_schemes_from_three_classes_of_linear_codes","3079587_Minimal_vectors_in_linear_codes","2553803_Quadratic_Residue_Codes_and_Divisibility"]}
