{"id":"312854425_Distributed_recursive_filtering_for_stochastic_systems_under_uniform_quantizations_and_deception_attacks_through_sensor_networks","abstract":"This paper is concerned with the distributed recursive filtering problem for a class of discrete time-delayed stochastic systems subject to both uniform quantization and deception attack effects on the measurement outputs. The target plant is disturbed by the multiplicative as well as additive white noises. A novel distributed filter is designed where the available innovations are from not only the individual sensor but also its neighboring ones according to the given topology. Attention is focused on the design of a distributed recursive filter such that, in the simultaneous presence of time-delays, deception attacks and uniform quantization effects, an upper bound for the filtering error covariance is guaranteed and subsequently minimized by properly designing the filter parameters via a gradient-based method at each sampling instant. Furthermore, by utilizing the mathematical induction, a sufficient condition is established to ensure the asymptotic boundedness of the sequence of the error covariance. Finally, a simulation example is utilized to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed design scheme of distributed filters.","authors":["Derui Ding","Zidong Wang","Daniel W.C.
