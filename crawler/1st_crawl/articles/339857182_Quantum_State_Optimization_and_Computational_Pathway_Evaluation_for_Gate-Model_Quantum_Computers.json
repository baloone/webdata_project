{"id":"339857182_Quantum_State_Optimization_and_Computational_Pathway_Evaluation_for_Gate-Model_Quantum_Computers","abstract":"A computational problem fed into a gate-model quantum computer identifies an objective function with a particular computational pathway (objective function connectivity). The solution of the computational problem involves identifying a target objective function value that is the subject to be reached. A bottleneck in a gate-model quantum computer is the requirement of several rounds of quantum state preparations, high-cost run sequences, and multiple rounds of measurements to determine a target (optimal) state of the quantum computer that achieves the target objective function value. Here, we define a method for optimal quantum state determination and computational path evaluation for gate-model quantum computers. We prove a state determination method that finds a target system state for a quantum computer at a given target objective function value. The computational pathway evaluation procedure sets the connectivity of the objective function in the target system state on a fixed hardware architecture of the quantum computer. The proposed solution evolves the target system state without requiring the preparation of intermediate states between the initial and target states of the quantum computer. Our method avoids high-cost system state preparations and expensive running procedures and measurement apparatuses in gate-model quantum computers. The results are convenient for gate-model quantum computations and the near-term quantum devices of the quantum Internet.","authors":["Laszlo Gyongyosi"],"meta":["March 2020Scientific Reports 10(1):4543","DOI:10.1038/s41598-020-61316-4"],"references":["339392205_Delocalized_information_in_quantum_networks","339317656_Entanglement_accessibility_measures_for_the_quantum_Internet","339309988_Theory_of_Noise-Scaled_Stability_Bounds_and_Entanglement_Rate_Maximization_in_the_Quantum_Internet","338507141_Optimizing_High-Efficiency_Quantum_Memory_with_Quantum_Machine_Learning_for_Near-Term_Quantum_Devices","336744162_Quantum_supremacy_using_a_programmable_superconducting_processor","336341938_Towards_Large-Scale_Quantum_Networks","336113153_Practical_figures_of_merit_and_thresholds_for_entanglement_distribution_in_quantum_networks","335947009_Bounds_for_multi-end_communication_over_quantum_networks","337784291_Ground-to-satellite_quantum_teleportation","336987449_Quantum_Computing_based_Hybrid_Solution_Strategies_for_Large-scale_Discrete-Continuous_Optimization_Problems"]}
