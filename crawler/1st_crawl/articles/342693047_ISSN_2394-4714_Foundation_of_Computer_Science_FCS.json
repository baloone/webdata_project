Precisely the paper compares between two methods of training mode in equalizers that are used with MIMO-OFDM system, the Full Frame (FF) method that uses one frame from sets of frames as a desired signal and the Part Frame (PF) method uses part of the frame as a desired signal. The investigation aims to determine which method of training is best among the adopted equalizers in terms of tolerance to AWGN, adjustment speed and complexity. This has been achieved via computer simulation of the four equalization techniques mentioned earlier under the two forms of training modes. The results of the investigation show that the FF mode of training is preferable with LMS, VSSLMS and SignLMS and can be resumed every 1/16 frames. However, the PF is preferable when the RLS is used and can be resumed every 1/32 of the frame size.","authors":["Bashar A.","Siddeeq Yousif Ameen"],"meta":["May 2017","Project: Impact of Different Training Mode on Adaptive Equalization Techniques for MIMO-OFDM Syste"],"references":["312196689_Performance_Enhancements_of_MIMO-OFDM_System_Using_Various_Adaptive_Receiver_Structures","273012220_Performance_Analysis_of_MIMO-OFDM_by_Spatial_Diversity_with_STBC4","50947788_Adaptive_Equalization_Algorithms_An_Overview","290299781_Performance_analysis_of_equalization_techniques_for_MIMO_systems_in_wireless_communication","52008170_Adaptive_Filters_Theory_and_Applications_Second_Edition"]}
