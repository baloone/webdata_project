{"id":"310815297_A_geometrical_investigation_on_the_generalized_lplq_norm_for_blind_deconvolution","abstract":"Application of the generalized norm in blind deconvolution has shown good performance for retrieving sparse signals from noisy data. However, the capability of different norms to regularize the blind deconvolution has been still less discussed, especially when p is chosen within . In this paper, we present a novel geometrical analysis on the generalized norm and we also discuss the effects of different choices of and on the results of blind deconvolution. It is found that the generalized norm can be factorized into a composition of two mappings and several important characteristics of the generalized norm can be uncovered through these two mappings. Based on the findings in the geometrical property of the generalized norm, several insights for the application of norm to blind deconvolution are further discussed in the conclusions.","authors":["Xiaodong Jia","Ming Zhao","Matt Buzza","Yuan Di"],"meta":["November 2016Signal Processing 134","DOI:10.1016/j.sigpro.2016.11.018"],"references":["306421272_Wind_turbine_performance_degradation_assessment_based_on_a_novel_similarity_metric_for_machine_performance_curves","303137904_Greedy_layer-wise_training_of_deep_networks","286763624_Vibration_response_mechanism_of_faulty_outer_race_rolling_element_bearings_for_quantitative_analysis","312495803_Image_reconstruction_from_phased-array_data_based_on_multichannel_blind_deconvolution","311647858_Understanding_and_evaluating_blind_deconvolution_algorithms","303438705_Detection_and_recovery_of_fault_impulses_via_improved_harmonic_product_spectrum_and_its_application_in_defect_size_estimation_of_train_bearings","300641794_New_Criteria_for_Adaptive_Blind_Deconvolution_of_Vibration_Signals_from_Planetary_Gearbox","285599320_Laplacian_Eigenmaps_for_Dimensionality_Reduction_and_Data_Representation","284035345_Nonlinear_Dimensionality_Reduction_by_Locally_Linear_Embedding","283431823_Wavelet_analysis_theory_and_applications","281427729_Dictionary_Learning_for_Blind_One_Bit_Compressed_Sensing","280222432_Periodicity-based_kurtogram_for_random_impulse_resistance","279904668_Non-negative_Matrix_Factorization_with_Sparseness_Constraints","273352965_Gear_classification_and_fault_detection_using_a_diffusion_map_framework","270256615_Fault_Detection_Enhancement_in_Rolling_Element_Bearings_Using_the_Minimum_Entropy_Deconvolution"]}
