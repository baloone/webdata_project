{"id":"318787719_Research_on_generating_method_of_fluctuating_wind_field_of_LES_based_on_WAWS","abstract":"In order to accurately simulate the inlet boundary conditions of turbulence information of Large Eddy Simulation (LES), the fluctuating time-history data satisfying the target wind field were simulated with the weighted amplitude wave superposition (WAWS) considering the integral scale, power spectrum, turbulence intensity and wind velocity profile. The fluctuating time-history data were given to the inlet boundary of LES by the secondary development of the commercial software FLUENT. Consequently, the fluctuating information of the Large Eddy Simulation was obtained. The two numerical models were established on the basis of the experiment data in the wind tunnel. The first was the flow field without any obstacles in which the fluctuating time-history data simulated by WAWS method were the inlet boundary condition. The second was the flow field with spires and roughness element model in accordance with those in the wind tunnel, in which the mean wind velocity was given to the inlet boundary and the wind turbulences were generated by the spires and roughness elements. The results show that fluctuating wind field based on the WAWS method can be the inlet boundary for the LES and provides a reference for the investigation of the inlet boundary conditions of LES.
