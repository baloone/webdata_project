{"id":"289420216_Getting_more_women_into_science_Knowledge_issues","abstract":"Innovations surrounding women and gender have rocked the world of science and technology in the past three decades. Who, for example, could have predicted that the chief scientist at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) would be a woman (France Córdova, who is now chancellor at the University of California, Riverside)? Or who would have thought that geneticists would dethrone the ‘master-gene’ model – that conceptualised mammalian sex as determined by a single master gene on the Y chromosome – and put in its place an account that emphasises interactions between the testes and ovaries? (Richardson, 2008) Or who would have imagined that an artificial knee would be designed with 19 unique aspects to meet the unique skeletal and load-bearing needs of females? (Feder, 2006). In my lifetime, the situation in the United States has improved dramatically for intellectual women. We can measure some of these changes iconographically. Anyone growing up in the American consumer culture understands the power of images. Images project messages about hopes and dreams, mien and demeanour, about who should be a scientist and what science is all about. We see some interesting changes in who is imagined to be a scientist in our society.","authors":["L.
