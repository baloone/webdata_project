{"id":"283117920_Transformation_of_fractions_into_simple_fractions_in_divisive_meadows","abstract":"Meadows are alternatives for fields with a purely equational axiomatization.\nAt the basis of meadows lies the decision to make the multiplicative inverse\noperation total by imposing that the multiplicative inverse of zero is zero.\nDivisive meadows are meadows with the multiplicative inverse operation replaced\nby a division operation. Viewing a fraction as a term over the signature of\ndivisive meadows that is of the form p / q, we investigate which divisive\nmeadows admit transformation of fractions into simple fractions, i.e. fractions\nwithout proper subterms that are fractions.","authors":["Jan Bergstra","C.
