{"id":"334195543_Fooling_the_Brain_Fooling_the_Pain_The_Role_of_Mirror_Therapy_and_Modern_Uses_in_Virtual_Reality","abstract":"The brain is the control center of the body, and has to process information coming from all five of the senses. One of the senses, vision, is often stronger than the others. Mirror therapy is a type of therapy that uses vision to treat the pain that people with amputated limbs sometimes feel in their missing limbs. Mirror therapy does this by tricking the brain: it gives the illusion that the missing limb is moving, as the person looks at the real, remaining limb in a mirror. This way, the brain ignores the fact that it receives no signal of movement from the amputated limb itself. Although very promising, mirror therapy has some limitations, and scientists are working to overcome these limitations so that mirror therapy can be used to address more complex movements or different kinds of pain. Virtual reality is a promising tool offering interactive, realistic, and modifiable environments that are able to trick the brain in more complex ways.","authors":["Charles Faure","Annabelle Limballe","Hugo Kerherv√©"],"meta":["July 2019Frontiers for Young Minds 7:91","DOI:10.3389/frym.2019.00091"],"references":["314254135_Using_visuo-kinetic_virtual_reality_to_induce_illusory_spinal_movement_the_MoOVi_Illusion","263056598_Manipulation_of_visual_biofeedback_during_gait_with_a_time_delayed_adaptive_Virtual_Mirror_Box","15633262_Touching_the_phantom_limb_3","14562484_Synaesthesia_in_Phantom_Limbs_Induced_with_Mirrors"]}
