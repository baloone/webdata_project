{"id":"255700134_Systems_Modeling_with_EAST-ADL_for_Fault_Tree_Analysis_through_HiP-HOPS","abstract":"EAST-ADL is a domain-specific modeling framework with methodology and language support\nfor the engineering of automotive embedded systems. In regard to functional safety, it aims to\nprovide the maximum possible support for ISO 26262 so that all safety related information can be\nconsolidated seamlessly in a common system model together with the requirements specification.\nThis paper describes the EAST-ADL support for the modeling of plausible error behaviors as an\northogonal system view. We introduce in particular an integration of such EAST-ADL models\nwith the HiP-HOPS method for automated temporal fault tree analysis.","authors":["De-Jiu Chen","Nidhal Mahmud","Martin Walker","Lei Feng"],"meta":["September 2013","Conference: 4th IFAC Workshop on Dependable Control of Discrete SystemsAt: York, U.K."],"references":["235970001_An_Architectural_Approach_to_the_Analysis_Verification_and_Validation_of_Software_Intensive_Embedded_Systems","234840456_ESACS_an_integrated_methodology_for_design_and_safety_analysis_of_complex_systems","224164983_A_translation_of_State_Machines_to_temporal_fault_trees","221246465_Automatic_allocation_of_safety_integrity_levels","221147372_Hierarchically_Performed_Hazard_Origin_and_Propagation_Studies","220514341_Integrated_safety_and_architecture_modeling_for_automotive_embedded_systems","236124124_Dynamic_model-based_safety_analysis_from_state_machines_to_temporal_fault_trees","235780965_Compositional_synthesis_of_Temporal_Fault_Trees_from_State_Machines","224262684_Compositional_Synthesis_of_Temporal_Fault_Trees_from_State_Machines","223244232_Qualitative_temporal_analysis_Towards_a_full_implementation_of_the_Fault_Tree_Handbook"]}
