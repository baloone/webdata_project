{"id":"308829442_Influence_of_Secondary_Cooling_Mode_on_Solidification_Structure_and_Macro-segregation_Behavior_for_High-carbon_Continuous_Casting_Bloom","abstract":"A cellular automatonâ€“finite element coupling model for high-carbon continuously cast bloom of GCr15 steel is established to simulate the solidification structure and to investigate the influence of different secondary cooling modes on characteristic parameters such as equiaxed crystal ratio, grain size and secondary dendrite arm spacing, in which the effect of phase transformation and electromagnetic stirring is taken into consideration. On this basis, evolution of carbon macro-segregation for GCr15 steel bloom is researched correspondingly via industrial tests. Based on above analysis, the relationship among secondary cooling modes, characteristic parameters for solidification structure as well as carbon macro-segregation is illustrated to obtain optimum secondary cooling strategy and alleviate carbon macro-segregation degree for GCr15 steel bloom in continuous casting process. The evaluating method for element macro-segregation is applicable in various steel types.","authors":["Kun Dou","Zhenguo Yang","Qing Liu","Yunhua Huang"],"meta":["January 2016High Temperature Materials and Processes 36(7)","DOI:10.1515/htmp-2016-0022"],"references":["279039282_Effect_of_Electromagnetic_Stirring_on_Molten_Steel_Flow_and_Solidification_in_Bloom_Mold","276990036_Numerical_simulation_of_solidification_structure_of_high_carbon_SWRH77B_billet_based_on_the_CAFE_method","250161176_Morphology_and_Segregation_in_Continuously_Cast_High_Carbon_Steel_Billets","316340386_Study_on_Solidification_and_Segregation_of_Stirred_Ingot","298115287_Simulation_for_Progress_of_Solid-Liquid_Coexisting_Zone_in_Continuous_Casting_of_Carbon_Steels","279900207_Mathematical_modelling_of_fluid_flow_heat_transfer_and_solidification_phenomena_in_continuous_casting_of_steel","270190389_Solidification_Structure_and_Compactness_Degree_of_Central_Equiaxed_Grain_Zone_in_Continuous_Casting_Billet_Using_Cellular_Automaton-Finite_Element_Method","264487730_Study_on_Solidification_Structure_of_Wheel_Steel_Round_Billet_Using_FE-CA_Coupling_Model","250161611_Simulation_of_3D-Microstructure_in_Free-cutting_Steel_9SMn28_under_Water_Cooling_Condition_with_Convection_and_Porosity","250160789_Numerical_Simulation_of_Solidification_Structure_Formation_during_Continuous_Casting_in_Fe07massC_Alloy_Using_Cellular_Automaton_Method"]}
