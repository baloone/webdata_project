{"id":"315176029_Theoretical_evaluation_of_Brillouin_dynamic_grating_length_localized_by_optical_correlation_domain_technique_through_reflection_spectrum_simulation","abstract":"We derive formulae based on Fourier transformation to calculate the reflection spectrum of a Brillouin dynamic grating (BDG), which is localized along an optical fiber by an optical correlation domain technique. First, we calculate the typical reflection spectra of the BDG localized by the technique and confirm the validity of the formulae by showing coincidence with previous theoretical or experimental works. Next, we evaluate theoretically the spatial resolution in the BDG distributed measurement by the technique, through simulations considering different strained fiber lengths. It is confirmed theoretically, for the first time, that the resolution in the BDG measurement is worse than that for the Brillouin gain spectrum.","authors":["Rodrigo Kendy Yamashita","Masato Kishi","Kazuo Hotate"],"meta":["April 2017Applied Physics Express 10(4):042501","DOI:10.7567/APEX.10.042501"],"references":["45255874_Time-Domain_Distributed_Fiber_Sensor_With_1_cm_Spatial_Resolution_Based_on_Brillouin_Dynamic_Grating","41041618_Truly_distributed_birefringence_measurement_of_polarization-maintaining_fibers_based_on_transient_Brillouin_grating","5400669_All-optical_dynamic_grating_generation_based_on_Brillouin_scattering_in_polarization_maintaining_fiber","3240881_Spontaneous_and_stimulated_Brillouin_scattering_gain_spectra_in_optical_fibers","264569753_Filter_Response_of_Nonuniform_Almost-Periodic_Structures","261504949_Simulation_for_Estimating_Spatial_Resolution_in_Distributed_Measurement_of_Brillouin_Dynamic_Grating_by_Correlation_Domain_Technique","260521215_Spatial_Resolution_Improvement_in_Correlation_Domain_Distributed_Measurement_of_Brillouin_Grating","259520853_Fiber_Distributed_Brillouin_Sensing_with_Optical_Correlation_Domain_Techniques","241780189_Reflection_spectrum_analysis_of_stimulated_Brillouin_scattering_dynamic_grating","224117869_Demonstration_of_Brillouin_Distributed_Discrimination_of_Strain_and_Temperature_Using_a_Polarization-Maintaining_Optical_Fiber","46108130_Observation_of_narrowband_intrinsic_spectra_of_Brillouin_dynamic_gratings","26276391_Tunable_optical_delays_based_on_Brillouin_dynamic_grating_in_optical_fibers","24398708_Optical_Time-Domain_Measurement_of_Brillouin_Dynamic_Grating_Spectrum_in_a_Polarization_Maintaining_Fiber","24251866_Correlation-based_distributed_measurement_of_a_dynamic_grating_spectrum_generated_in_stimulated_Brillouin_scattering_in_a_polarization-maintaining_optical_fiber","23973039_Complete_discrimination_of_strain_and_temperature_using_Brillouin_frequency_shift_and_birefringence_in_a_polarization-maintaining_fiber"]}
