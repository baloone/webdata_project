{"id":"258818395_Parameterized_Approximability_of_Maximizing_the_Spread_of_Influence_in_Networks","abstract":"In this paper, we consider the problem of maximizing the spread of\ninfluence through a social network. Here, we are given a graph\n$G=(V,E)$, a positive integer $k$ and a threshold value $\\thr(v)$\nattached to each vertex $v \\in V$. The objective is then to find a\nsubset of $k$ vertices to \"activate\" such that the number of activated\nvertices at the end of a propagation process is maximum. A vertex $v$\ngets activated if at least $\\thr(v)$ of its neighbors are. We show that\nthis problem is strongly inapproximable in fpt-time with respect to\n(w.r.t.) parameter $k$ even for very restrictive thresholds. For\nunanimity thresholds, we prove that the problem is inapproximable in\npolynomial time and the decision version is $\\wone$-hard w.r.t.\nparameter $k$. On the positive side, it becomes $r(n)$-approximable in\nfpt-time w.r.t. parameter $k$ for any strictly increasing function $r$.\nMoreover, we give an fpt-time algorithm to solve the decision version\nfor bounded degree graphs.","authors":["Cristina Bazgan","Morgan Chopin","Andr√© Nichterlein","Florian Sikora"],"meta":["March 2013Journal of Discrete Algorithms 27","DOI:10.1016/j.jda.2014.05.001"],"references":["260837038_Parameterized_Inapproximability_of_Target_Set_Selection_and_Generalizations","221544043_On_Tractable_Cases_of_Target_Set_Selection","2477877_Maximizing_the_Spread_of_Influence_through_a_Social_Network","269001981_Parametrized_complexity_theory","266707982_Variants_of_Spreading_Messages","265502171_Fundamentals_of_Parameterized_Complexity","265219134_Exact_and_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Densest_k-Subgraph","262399814_Constant_Thresholds_Can_Make_Target_Set_Selection_Tractable","262160786_Detecting_high_log-densities_-_An_On14_approximation_for_densest_k-subgraph","257650163_Invitation_to_Fixed-Parameter_Algorithms","251351298_Clique_is_hard_to_approximate_within","232619366_Clique_is_hard_to_approximate_within_n1_-_E","225163027_Random_Separation_A_New_Method_for_Solving_Fixed-Cardinality_Optimization_Problems","223115669_Some_APX-completeness_results_for_cubic_graphs","222699365_Irreversible_-threshold_processes_Graph-theoretical_threshold_models_of_the_spread_of_disease_and_of_opinion","222571771_Treewidth_Governs_the_Complexity_of_Target_Set_Selection","222134019_Local_majorities_coalitions_and_monopolies_in_graphs_A_review","221591079_The_importance_of_being_biased","221427143_Spreading_Messages","221013485_Variants_of_Spreading_Messages","220617401_Ruling_Out_PTAS_for_Graph_Min-Bisection_Dense_k-Subgraph_and_Bipartite_Clique","220616667_On_Syntactic_versus_Computational_Views_of_Approximability","220533556_Approximation_Algorithms_and_Hardness_for_Domination_with_Propagation","220533445_On_the_Approximability_of_Influence_in_Social_Networks","45895759_Detecting_High_Log-Densities_--_an_On14_Approximation_for_Densest_k-Subgraph","30987754_Parameterized_Complexity_of_Cardinality_Constrained_Optimization_Problems","30987752_Parameterized_Complexity_and_Approximation_Algorithms","3593074_On_syntactic_versus_computational_views_of_approximability","2901734_The_Importance_of_Being_Biased"]}
