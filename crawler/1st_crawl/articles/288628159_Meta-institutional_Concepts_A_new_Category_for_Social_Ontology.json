{"id":"288628159_Meta-institutional_Concepts_A_new_Category_for_Social_Ontology","abstract":"In Speech Acts, John Searle argues that institutional facts presuppose, for their existence, the existence of certain institutions (understood as systems of constitutive rules). In this paper I extend Searle s theory of institutional facts arguing that a further level is needed for the investigation of the structure of institutional reality: the level of meta-institutional concepts. The meta-institutional concepts are concepts that go beyond (Greek: metd) the institutions of which they are conditions of possibility. An example of meta-institutional concept is the concept of game. In a culture which does not have the concept of game, we could move the chess-men according to the rules of chess, we could also perform a castling, but it would be impossible to play chess.","authors":["Giuseppe Lorini"],"meta":["June 2014Rivista di Estetica 56(2):127-139","DOI:10.4000/estetica.876","Project: The Background of Normativity"],"references":["344505005_Doing_without_Concepts","332872235_Speech_act_theory_and_phenomenology","332872233_Towards_a_history_of_speech_act_theory","285427154_Truth","280677197_The_Nature_of_Institutional_Obligation","275872349_Rules_and_Practices","275869706_Two_Concepts_of_Rules","272593823_Rules_in_Oracles_and_Games","270324811_Brute_Facts","246393589_How_to_Derive_Ought_From_Is"]}
