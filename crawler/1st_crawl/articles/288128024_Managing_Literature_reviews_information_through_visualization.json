{"id":"288128024_Managing_Literature_reviews_information_through_visualization","abstract":"Systematic Literature Review (SR) and Systematic Mappings (SM) are scientific literature review techniques that follow well-defined stages, according to a protocol previously elaborated. The goal is helping in finding evidence about a particular research topic and mapping a research area, respectively. Their steps are laborious and a computational support is essential to improve the quality of their conduction. Aiming to offer computational support to these types of reviews, the StArt (State of the Art through Systematic Review) tool was developed. Besides the expected functionalities, StArt generates studies score, uses information visualization and text mining techniques to facilitate the research area mapping and to identify the studies relevance. StArt has been developed through an incremental process by academics who adopt SR and SM. As the expectation is to have a tool that really aids the conduction of these types of reviews, new ideas are always investigated and make StArt different from other alternatives. Visualization and text mining techniques seems to be a powerful resource for facilitating data abstraction in the context of SRs and SMs, allowing the improvement of the review and the conclusions about it.","authors":["S.
