{"id":"317175637_The_fifty_highest_cited_papers_in_anterior_cruciate_ligament_injury","abstract":"The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is one of the most common injured knee ligaments and at the same time, one of the most frequent injuries seen in the sport orthopaedic practice. Due to the clinical relevance of ACL injuries, numerous papers focussing on this topic including biomechanical-, basic science-, clinical- or animal studies, were published. The purpose of this study was to determine the most frequently cited scientific articles which address this subject, establish a ranking of the 50 highest cited papers and analyse them according to their characteristics.","authors":["Ines Vielgut","Jan Dauwe","Andreas Leithner","Lukas A Holzer"],"meta":["May 2017International Orthopaedics 41(7)","DOI:10.1007/s00264-017-3513-3"],"references":["283725177_Current_Trends_in_Anterior_Cruciate_Ligament_Reconstruction_A_Review","276070217_Impact_and_alternative_metrics_for_medical_publishing_Our_experience_with_International_Orthopaedics","270964401_The_50_Most-cited_Articles_in_Orthopaedic_Surgery_From_Mainland_China","268506530_The_Hundred_Most-Cited_Publications_in_Orthopaedic_Knee_Research","309713692_Projections_of_Primary_and_Revision_Hip_and_Knee_Arthroplasty_in_the_United_States_from_2005_to_2030","309015709_The_top_100_cited_articles_in_urology_An_update","308906197_Primary_repair_of_the_anterior_cruciate_ligament_A_paradigm_shift","301304546_Management_of_anterior_cruciate_ligament_injury_Pathophysiology_and_treatment","287798052_The_50_Most_Cited_Articles_in_Orthopedic_Cartilage_Surgery","262021929_ACL_reconstruction_It's_all_about_timing"]}
