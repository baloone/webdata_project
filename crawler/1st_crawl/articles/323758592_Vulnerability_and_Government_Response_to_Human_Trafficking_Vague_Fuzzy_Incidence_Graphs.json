{"id":"323758592_Vulnerability_and_Government_Response_to_Human_Trafficking_Vague_Fuzzy_Incidence_Graphs","abstract":"We introduce the notion of a vague incidence graph and its eccentricity. We apply the results to problems involving human trafficking and illegal immigration. We are particularly interested in the roll played by countries' vulnerability and their government's response to human trafficking. We show of the leading illegal immigration routes through Mexico to the United States that Somalia has the highest eccentricity. We also provide measures on how much a region needs to reduce flow or increase government response to be modelled by a fuzzy incidence graph. It turns out that the Commonwealth of Independent States has the largest measure for both vulnerability and government response than any other region.","authors":["John N.
