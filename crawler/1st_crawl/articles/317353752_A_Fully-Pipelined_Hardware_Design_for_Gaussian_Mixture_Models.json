{"id":"317353752_A_Fully-Pipelined_Hardware_Design_for_Gaussian_Mixture_Models","abstract":"Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) are widely used in many applications such as data mining, signal processing and computer vision, for probability density modeling and soft clustering. However, the parameters of a GMM need to be estimated from data by, for example, the Expectation-Maximization algorithm for Gaussian Mixture Models (EM-GMM), which is computationally demanding. This paper presents a novel design for the EM-GMM algorithm targeting reconfigurable platforms, with five main contributions. First, a pipeline-friendly EM-GMM with diagonal covariance matrices that can easily be mapped to hardware architectures. Second, a function evaluation unit for Gaussian probability density based on fixed-point arithmetic. Third, our approach is extended to support a wide range of dimensions or/and components by fitting multiple pieces of smaller dimensions onto an FPGA chip. Fourth, we derive a cost and performance model that estimates logic resources. Fifth, our dataflow design targeting the Maxeler MPC-X2000 with a Stratix-5SGSD8 FPGA can run over 200 times faster than a 6-core Xeon E5645 processor, and over 39 times faster than a Pascal TITAN-X GPU. Our design provides a practical solution to applications for training and explores better parameters for GMMs with hundreds of millions of high dimensional input instances, for low-latency and high-performance applications.","authors":["Conghui He","Haohuan Fu","Ce Guo","Wayne Luk"],"meta":["June 2017IEEE Transactions on Computers PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TC.2017.2712152"],"references":["262566867_A_Study_of_Cross-Validation_and_Bootstrap_for_Accuracy_Estimation_and_Model_Selection","252013907_Fast_training_of_Large_Margin_diagonal_Gaussian_mixture_models_for_speaker_identification","250791017_Image_Segmentation_using_Gaussian_Mixture_Models","224353784_Hierarchical_Segmentation_for_Hardware_Function_Evaluation","224164584_Automatic_generation_of_polynomial-based_hardware_architectures_for_function_evaluation","221396500_Fast_Estimation_of_Gaussian_Mixture_Model_Parameters_on_GPU_Using_CUDA","221224843_FPGA-Accelerated_3D_Reconstruction_Using_Compressive_Sensing","26532173_A_Tutorial_on_Text-Independent_Speaker_Verification","7948995_A_Spatially_Constrained_Mixture_Model_for_Image_Segmentation","4090386_Improved_Adaptive_Gaussian_Mixture_Model_for_Background_Subtraction","3813345_Adaptive_Background_Mixture_Models_for_Real-Time_Tracking","3333516_Minimum_Classification_Error_Rate_Methods_for_Speech_Recognition","3333389_Robust_text-independent_speaker_identification_using_Gaussian_Mixture_speaker_models","2611505_A_New_Learning_Algorithm_for_Blind_Signal_Separation","2352264_A_Study_of_Cross-Validation_and_Bootstrap_for_Accuracy_Estimation_and_Model_Selection","312917987_A_gentle_tutorial_of_the_em_algorithm_and_its_application_to_parameter_estimation_for_Gaussian_mixture_and_hidden_Markov_models","269273367_FPGA_Gaussian_Random_Number_Generators_with_Guaranteed_Statistical_Accuracy","261961393_A_Parallel_EM_Algorithm_for_Gaussian_Mixture_Models_Implemented_on_a_NUMA_System_Using_OpenMP","261049805_A_fully-pipelined_expectation-maximization_engine_for_Gaussian_Mixture_Models","260835983_Scaling_Reverse_Time_Migration_Performance_through_Reconfigurable_Dataflow_Engines","254408043_Initializing_the_EM_algorithm_in_Gaussian_mixture_models_with_an_unknown_number_of_components","235360460_Image_Segmentation_in_Video_Sequences_A_Probabilistic_Approach","224149786_3D_image_segmentation_implementation_on_FPGA_using_the_EMMPM_algorithm","223836611_Speaker_identification_and_verification_using_Gaussian_Mixture_Speaker_Models","223748248_Choosing_starting_values_for_the_EM_algorithm_for_getting_the_highest_likehood_in_multivariate_Gaussian_mixture_models","222674333_Speaker_Verification_Using_Adapted_Gaussian_Mixture_Models","222559675_Robust_Monte_Carlo_Localization_for_Mobile_Robots","221148707_Fast_Parallel_Expectation_Maximization_for_Gaussian_Mixture_Models_on_GPUs_Using_CUDA","220525587_An_Efficient_Digital_VLSI_Implementation_of_Gaussian_Mixture_Models-Based_Classifier","6822796_Constrained_Gaussian_mixture_model_framework_for_automatic_segmentation_of_MR_brain_images","4193021_Table-based_polynomials_for_fast_hardware_function_evaluation","3337836_An_Efficient_Digital_VLSI_Implementation_of_Gaussian_Mixture_Models-Based_Classifier","3321168_Text-Independent_Speaker_Identification","2894920_Gaussian_Mixture_Models_for_On-line_Signature_Verification"]}
