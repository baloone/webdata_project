{"id":"268546805_Sahlqvist_theorems_for_precontact_logics","abstract":"Precontact logics are propositional modal logics that have been recently considered in order to obtain decidable fragments of the region-based theories of space introduced by\nDe Laguna and Whitehead. We give the definition of Sahlqvist formulas to this region-based setting and we prove correspondence and canonicity results. Together, these results give rise to a completeness result for precontact logics that are axiomatized by Sahlqvist axioms.","authors":["Philippe Balbiani","Stanislav Kikot"],"meta":["January 2014"],"references":["330422421_Contact_Algebras_and_Region-based_Theory_of_Space_Proximity_Approach-II","246845927_5_Model_theory_of_modal_logic","228922422_Spatial_reasoning_in_RCC-8_with_Boolean_region_terms","228792189_Combining_Spatial_and_Temporal_Logics_Expressiveness_Vs_Complexity","226341313_Region-Based_Theory_of_Space_Algebras_of_Regions_Representation_Theory_and_Logics","220706012_Modal_Definability_in_Languages_with_a_Finite_Number_of_Propositional_Variables_and_a_New_Extension_of_the_Sahlqvist's_Class","220706004_Semantic_Characterization_of_Kracht_Formulas","220642992_Region-based_theory_of_discrete_spaces_A_proximity_approach","220443747_Modal_Logics_for_Region-based_Theories_of_Space","220430012_The_Ackermann_approach_for_modal_logic_correspondence_theory_and_second-order_reduction","220245154_Hybrid_logics_with_Sahlqvist_axioms","220202565_Dynamic_logics_of_the_region-based_theory_of_discrete_spaces","45908786_Spatial_logics_with_connectedness_predicates","45905990_An_extension_of_Kracht's_theorem_to_generalized_Sahlqvist_formulas","2454980_On_the_Decision_Problem_for_Two-Variable_First-Order_Logic","2393612_Sahlqvist_Formulas_in_Hybrid_Polyadic_Modal_Logics","1959023_Algorithmic_correspondence_and_completeness_in_modal_logic_I_The_core_algorithm_SQEMA","285350971_Point_line_and_surface_as_sets_of_solids","257144679_Sahlqvist_theorem_for_modal_fixed_point_logic","229710549_On_languages_with_two_variables","223813201_Elementary_canonical_formulae_extending_Sahlqvist's_theorem","222416636_A_Sahlqvist_Theorem_for_Distributive_Modal_Logic","222410062_A_representation_theorem_for_Boolean_contact_algebras","220706041_The_Truth_About_Algorithmic_Problems_in_Correspondence_Theory","220315423_A_New_Proof_of_Sahlqvist's_Theorem_on_Modal_Definability_and_Completeness","220118021_Boolean_Logics_with_Relations","38383138_An_Undecidable_Problem_in_Correspondence_Theory","35631516_Completeness_and_Correspondence_in_the_First_and_Second_Order_Semantics_for_Modal_Logic"]}
