{"id":"258242817_A_Constraint_Solver_Based_on_Abstract_Domains","abstract":"In this article, we apply techniques from Abstract Interpretation (a general theory of semantic abstractions) to Constraint Programming (which aims at solving hard combinatorial problems with a generic framework based on first-order logics). We highlight some links and differences between these fields: both compute fixpoints by iteration but employ different extrapolation and refinement strategies; moreover, consistencies in Constraint Programming can be mapped to non-relational abstract domains. We then use these correspondences to build an abstract constraint solver that leverages abstract interpretation techniques (such as relational domains) to go beyond classic solvers. We present encouraging experimental results obtained with our prototype implementation.","authors":["Marie Pelleau","Antoine Miné","Charlotte Truchet","Frédéric Benhamou"],"meta":["January 2013","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-35873-9_26","Conference: VMCAI 2013 - 14th International Conference on Verification, Model Checking, and Abstract Interpretation"],"references":["262210853_When_the_Decreasing_Sequence_Fails","225461397_A_Generic_Geometrical_Constraint_Kernel_in_Space_and_Time_for_Handling_Polymorphic_k-Dimensional_Objects_SICS_technical_report_T2007-08","289921381_Image_shape_extraction_using_interval_methods","271436549_Image_Shape_Extraction_Using_Interval_Methods","267788238_A_Generalization_of_Stalmarck's_Method","262347245_Satisfiability_Solvers_Are_Static_Analysers","251442535_A_CP_framework_for_testing_CP","238123877_Weakly_Relational_Numerical_Abstract_Domains","226573330_Improving_the_results_of_static_analyses_of_programs_by_local_decreasing_iterations","225103229_APRON_A_Library_of_Numerical_Abstract_Domains_for_Static_Analysis"]}
