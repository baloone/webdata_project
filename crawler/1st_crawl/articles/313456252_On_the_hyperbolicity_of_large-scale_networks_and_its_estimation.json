{"id":"313456252_On_the_hyperbolicity_of_large-scale_networks_and_its_estimation","abstract":"Through detailed analysis of scores of publicly available data sets corresponding to a wide range of large-scale networks, from communication and road networks to various forms of social networks, we explore a little-studied geometric characteristic of real-life networks, namely their hyperbolicity. We provide strong evidence that large-scale communication and social networks exhibit this fundamental property, and through extensive computations we quantify the degree of hyperbolicity of each network in comparison to its diameter. By contrast, and as evidence of the validity of the methodology, applying the same technique to graphs of road networks shows that they are not hyperbolic, which is as expected. Finally, we present practical computational means for detection of hyperbolicity and show how the test itself may be scaled to much larger graphs than those we examined via renormalization group methodology.","authors":["William S.
