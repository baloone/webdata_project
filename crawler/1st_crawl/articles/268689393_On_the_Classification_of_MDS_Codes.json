{"id":"268689393_On_the_Classification_of_MDS_Codes","abstract":"A $q$-ary code of length $n$, size $M$, and minimum distance $d$ is called an\n$(n,M,d)_q$ code. An $(n,q^{k},n-k+1)_q$ code is called a maximum distance\nseparable (MDS) code. In this work, some MDS codes over small alphabets are\nclassified. It is shown that every $(k+d-1,q^k,d)_q$ code with $k\\geq 3$, $d\n\\geq 3$, $q \\in \\{5,7\\}$ is equivalent to a linear code with the same\nparameters. This implies that the $(6,5^4,3)_5$ code and the $(n,7^{n-2},3)_7$\nMDS codes for $n\\in\\{6,7,8\\}$ are unique. The classification of\none-error-correcting $8$-ary MDS codes is also finished; there are $14$, $8$,\n$4$, and $4$ equivalence classes of $(n,8^{n-2},3)_8$ codes for $n=6,7,8,9$,\nrespectively. One of the equivalence classes of perfect $(9,8^7,3)_8$ codes\ncorresponds to the Hamming code and the other three are nonlinear codes for\nwhich there exists no previously known construction.","authors":["Janne I.
