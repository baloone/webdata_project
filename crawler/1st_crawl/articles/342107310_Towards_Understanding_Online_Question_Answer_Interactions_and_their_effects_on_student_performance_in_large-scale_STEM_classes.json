{"id":"342107310_Towards_Understanding_Online_Question_Answer_Interactions_and_their_effects_on_student_performance_in_large-scale_STEM_classes","abstract":"Online question & answer (Q & A) is a distinctive type of online interaction that is impactful on student learning. Prior studies on online interaction in large-scale classes mainly focused on online discussion and were conducted mainly in non-STEM fields. This research aims to quantify the effects of online Q & A interactions on student performance in the context of STEM education. 218 computer science students from a large university in the southeastern United States participated in this research. Data of four online Q & A activities was mined from the online Q & A forum for the course, including three student activities (asking questions, answering questions and viewing questions/answers) and one instructor activity (answering questions/providing clarifications). These activities were found to have different effects on student performance. Viewing questions/answers was found to have the greatest effect, while interaction with instructors showed minimum effects. This research fills the gap of lacking research in online Q & A, and the results of this research can inform the effective usage of online Q & A in large-scale STEM courses.","authors":["David Hamilton Smith","Qiang Hao","Vanessa Dennen","Michael Tsikerdekis"],"meta":["June 2020International Journal of Educational Research 17(20)","DOI:10.1186/s41239-020-00200-7"],"references":["331607136_Automatic_Identification_of_Ineffective_Online_Student_Questions_in_Computing_Education","322079674_Analyzing_the_Social_Networks_of_High-_and_Low-Performing_Students_in_Online_Discussion_Forums","321328730_Truth_matters_Teaching_young_students_to_search_for_the_most_reasonable_answer","318288705_Social_capital_motivations_and_knowledge_sharing_intention_in_health_Q_A_communities","315043681_Predicting_Computer_Science_Students'_Online_Help-Seeking_Tendencies","305679079_The_influence_of_achievement_goals_on_online_help_seeking_of_computer_science_students","320849705_Friends_and_gurus_do_students_ask_for_help_from_those_they_know_or_those_who_would_know","305314474_The_Enjoyment_of_Social_QA_Websites_Usage_A_Multiple_Mediators_Model","301340946_What_are_the_most_important_predictors_of_computer_science_students'_online_help-seeking_behaviors","284099020_Application_of_online_discussion_and_cooperative_learning_strategies_to_online_and_blended_college_courses"]}
