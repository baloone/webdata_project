With a variety of voice-user interfaces being available, some as a part of the digital technologies such as smartphones (Google Assistant, voice-enabled search, Apple's Siri) and others as independent technology artifacts (Google Home, Amazon's Alexa as Echo), there is a diverse range of users who are adopting the technology for a variety of purposes.
