{"id":"262320725_The_Domino_Effect_of_Password_Reuse","abstract":"The importance of password security which is considered as an essential form of user authentication both on the Internet and for internal organizational computing systems is discussed. Password protection schemes are used to protect relatively low-sensitivity systems such as access to online archives as well as highly sensitive corporate intranets or personal bank accounts. The growth of e-commerce has led to a huge increase in the numbers of passwords required by individual users, very often duplicated over and over throughout the Web. In such an environment, a password, and all the accounts it provides access to, can no more be secure than the weakest system using that password.","authors":["Blake Ives","Kenneth Walsh","Helmut Schneider"],"meta":["April 2004Communications of the ACM 47(4):75-78","DOI:10.1145/975817.975820"],"references":["220427273_Users_Are_Not_the_Enemy","2404434_Transforming_the_'Weakest_Link'_-_a_HumanComputer_Interaction_Approach_to_Usable_and_Effective_Security","2553717_Password_Security_A_Case_History"]}
