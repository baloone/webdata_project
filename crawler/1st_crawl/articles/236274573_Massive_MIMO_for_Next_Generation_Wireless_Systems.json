{"id":"236274573_Massive_MIMO_for_Next_Generation_Wireless_Systems","abstract":"Multi-user Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) offers big advantages over\nconventional point-to-point MIMO: it works with cheap single-antenna terminals,\na rich scattering environment is not required, and resource allocation is\nsimplified because every active terminal utilizes all of the time-frequency\nbins. However, multi-user MIMO, as originally envisioned with roughly equal\nnumbers of service-antennas and terminals and frequency division duplex\noperation, is not a scalable technology. Massive MIMO (also known as\n\"Large-Scale Antenna Systems\", \"Very Large MIMO\", \"Hyper MIMO\", \"Full-Dimension\nMIMO\" & \"ARGOS\") makes a clean break with current practice through the use of a\nlarge excess of service-antennas over active terminals and time division duplex\noperation. Extra antennas help by focusing energy into ever-smaller regions of\nspace to bring huge improvements in throughput and radiated energy efficiency.\nOther benefits of massive MIMO include the extensive use of inexpensive\nlow-power components, reduced latency, simplification of the media access\ncontrol (MAC) layer, and robustness to intentional jamming. The anticipated\nthroughput depend on the propagation environment providing asymptotically\northogonal channels to the terminals, but so far experiments have not disclosed\nany limitations in this regard. While massive MIMO renders many traditional\nresearch problems irrelevant, it uncovers entirely new problems that urgently\nneed attention: the challenge of making many low-cost low-precision components\nthat work effectively together, acquisition and synchronization for\nnewly-joined terminals, the exploitation of extra degrees of freedom provided\nby the excess of service-antennas, reducing internal power consumption to\nachieve total energy efficiency reductions, and finding new deployment\nscenarios. This paper presents an overview of the massive MIMO concept and\ncontemporary research.","authors":["Erik G.
