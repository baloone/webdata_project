{"id":"287052477_Automated_Cyber_Situation_Awareness_Tools_and_Models_For_Improving_Analyst_Performance","abstract":"An ever increasing number of critical missions rely today on complex Information Technology infrastructures, making such missions vulnerable to a wide range of potentially devastating cyber-attacks. Attackers can exploit network configurations and vulnerabilities to incrementally penetrate a network and compromise critical systems, thus rendering security monitoring and intrusion detection much more challenging. It is also evident from the ever growing number of high-profile cyber-attacks reported in the news that not only are cyber-attacks growing in sophistication but also in numbers. For these reasons, cyber-security analysts need to continuously monitor large amounts of alerts and data from a multitude of sensors in order to detect attacks in a timely manner and mitigate their impact. However—given the inherent complexity of the problem—manual analysis is labor-intensive and error-prone, and distracts the analyst from getting the “big picture” of the cyber situation.","authors":["Massimiliano Albanese","Hasan Cam","Sushil Jajodia"],"meta":["September 2014","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-10374-7_3","Project: Computer-Aided Human Centric Cyber Situation Awareness"],"references":["260324570_Fast_Activity_Detection_Indexing_for_Temporal_Stochastic_Automaton-Based_Activity_Models","254045696_Cauldron_Mission-centric_cyber_situational_awareness_with_defense_in_depth","235979981_Time-efficient_and_cost-effective_network_hardening_using_attack_graphs","235025539_Understanding_Information_Age_Warfare","319770818_Toward_a_theory_of_situation_awareness_in_dynamic_systems_Situation_awareness","272927315_The_Mind's_New_Science","271461805_Modeling_impact_of_attacks_recovery_and_attackability_conditions_for_situational_awareness","270960141_How_we_Reason","267470949_Cyber_Situational_Awareness_Issues_and_Research","247534012_Situation_awareness_in_dynamic_systems"]}
