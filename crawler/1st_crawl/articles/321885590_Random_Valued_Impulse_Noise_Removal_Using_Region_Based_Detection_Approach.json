{"id":"321885590_Random_Valued_Impulse_Noise_Removal_Using_Region_Based_Detection_Approach","abstract":"Removal of random valued noisy pixel is extremely challenging when the noise density is above 50%. The existing filters are generally not capable of eliminating such noise when density is above 70%. In this paper a region wise density based detection algorithm for random valued impulse noise has been proposed. On the basis of the intensity values, the pixels of a particular window are sorted and then stored into four regions. The higher density based region is considered for stepwise detection of noisy pixels. As a result of this detection scheme a maximum of 75% of noisy pixels can be detected. For this purpose this paper proposes a unique noise removal algorithm. It was experimentally proved that the proposed algorithm not only performs exceptionally when it comes to visual qualitative judgment of standard images but also this filter combination outsmarts the existing algorithm in terms of MSE, PSNR and SSIM comparison even up to 70% noise density level.","authors":["Shubhendu Banerjee","Aritra Bandyopadhyay","Avik Mukherjee","Atanu Das"],"meta":["December 2017Engineering, Technology and Applied Science Research 7(6):2288-2292","DOI:10.48084/etasr.1609","Project: Random Valued Impulse Noise Removal"],"references":["301723266_A_deviation_based_identification_of_random_valued_impulse_noise_towards_image_filtering_using_neighborhood_approximation","280628480_A_Relook_and_Renovation_over_State-of-Art_Salt_and_Pepper_Noise_Removal_Techniques","270903837_Moderate_Density_Salt_Pepper_Noise_Removal","322715746_Exploratory_data_analysis","312771295_Image_quality_assessment_From_error_visibility_to_structural_similarity","312020223_Binary_expansion_based_denoising_algorithm_for_an_image_corrupted_by_Gaussian_noise","299536488_Sequentially_combined_mean-median_filter_for_high_density_salt_and_pepper_noise_removal","286734400_A_threshold_based_Directional_Weighted_Median_Filter_for_Removal_of_Random_Impulses_in_thermal_images","285058550_Exploratory_Data_Analysis","271420119_Impact_of_Wavelet_Transform_and_Median_Filtering_on_removal_of_Salt_and_Pepper_Noise_in_Digital_Images"]}
