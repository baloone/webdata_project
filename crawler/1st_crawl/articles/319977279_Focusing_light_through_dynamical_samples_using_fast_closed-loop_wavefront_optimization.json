{"id":"319977279_Focusing_light_through_dynamical_samples_using_fast_closed-loop_wavefront_optimization","abstract":"We describe a fast continuous optimization wavefront shaping system able to focus light through dynamic scattering media. A micro-electro-mechanical system-based spatial light modulator, a fast photodetector, and field programmable gate array electronics are combined to implement a continuous optimization of a wavefront with a single-mode optimization rate of 4.1 kHz. The system performances are demonstrated by focusing light through colloidal solutions of TiO2 particles in glycerol with tunable temporal stability.","authors":["Baptiste Blochet","Laurent Bourdieu","Sylvain Gigan"],"meta":["September 2017Optics Letters 42(23)","DOI:10.1364/OL.42.004994"],"references":["270513476_Optical_focusing_deep_inside_dynamic_scattering_media_with_near-infrared_time-reversed_ultrasonically_encoded_TRUE_light","235415652_Speeding_up_liquid_crystal_SLMs_using_overdrive_with_phase_change_reduction","228443515_Focusing_through_dynamic_scattering_media","313889401_In_vivo_three-photon_imaging_of_activity_of_GCaMP6-labeled_neurons_deep_in_intact_mouse_brain","313852464_Focusing_light_inside_dynamic_scattering_media_with_millisecond_digital_optical_phase_conjugation","311916649_Scattering_compensation_by_focus_scanning_holographic_aberration_probing_F-SHARP","281666966_Guidestar-assisted_wavefront-shaping_methods_for_focusing_light_into_biological_tissue","221774771_High-speed_scattering_medium_characterization_with_application_to_focusing_light_through_turbid_media","52006600_Ultra-deep_two-photon_fluorescence_excitation_in_turbid_media","10681569_Two-photon_imaging_to_a_depth_of_1000_mm_in_living_brains_by_use_of_a_TiAl2O3_regenerative_amplifier"]}
