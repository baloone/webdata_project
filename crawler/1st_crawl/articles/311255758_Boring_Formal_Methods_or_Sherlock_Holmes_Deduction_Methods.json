{"id":"311255758_Boring_Formal_Methods_or_Sherlock_Holmes_Deduction_Methods","abstract":"This paper provides an overview of common challenges in teaching of logic and formal methods to Computer Science and IT students. We discuss our experiences from the course IN3050: Applied Logic in Engineering, introduced as a “logic for everybody” elective course at TU Munich, Germany, to engage pupils studying Computer Science, IT and engineering subjects on Bachelor and Master levels. Our goal was to overcome the bias that logic and formal methods are not only very complicated but also very boring to study and to apply. In this paper, we present the core structure of the course, provide examples of exercises and evaluate the course based on the students’ surveys.","authors":["Maria Spichkova"],"meta":["July 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-50230-4_18","Conference: Federation of International Conferences on Software Technologies: Applications and Foundations","Project: RMIT SHEER Centre"],"references":["300072748_Applied_Logic_in_Engineering","280104813_Teaching_Logic_to_Information_Systems_Students_Challenges_and_Opportunities","274309848_Computational_Thinking","265875391_Integrating_Formal_Methods_into_Computer_Science_Curricula_at_a_University_of_Applied_Science","261988922_Human_Factors_of_Formal_Methods","260677290_A_Refined_Top-Down_Methodology_for_the_Development_of_Automotive_Software_Systems_-_The_KeylessEntry_System_Case_Study","246202968_FlexRay_und_FTCom_Formale_Spezifikation_in_FOCUS","237469430_A_Top-Down_Methodology_for_the_Development_of_Automotive_Software","229011934_Verified_System_Development_with_the_AutoFocus_Tool_Chain","228931112_UPCOMING_AUTOMOTIVE_STANDARDS_FOR_FAULT-TOLERANT_COMMUNICATION_FLEXRAY_AND_OSEKTIME_FTCOM","228685884_A_Strategy_and_Tool_Support_to_Motivate_the_Study_of_Formal_Methods_in_Undergraduate_Software_Design_and_Modeling_Courses","228613176_Responding_to_crises_in_transnational_education_New_challenges_for_higher_education","225389996_Invited_Talk_Weaving_Formal_Methods_into_the_Undergraduate_Computer_Science_Curriculum_Extended_Abstract","225325160_Mathematics_anxiety_and_mathematics_achievement","2719249_Logic_in_Computer_Science_Modelling_and_Reasoning_About_Systems","321521557_Aussagenlogik_Deduktion_und_Algorithmen","321515095_First-Order_Logic_and_Automated_Theorem_Proving","319394983_Artificial_Intelligence_A_Modern_Approach","319394978_Artificial_Intelligence_---_A_Modern_Approach","319394028_First-Order_Logic_and_Automated_Theorem_Proving","311258425_Exploring_the_Role_of_Logic_and_Formal_Methods_in_Information_Systems_Education","300709573_40_Years_of_Formal_Methods","300069899_Teaching_Formal_Methods_for_Software_Engineering","263720711_Swimming_in_the_Deep_End_Transnational_Teaching_as_Culture_Learning","260643289_Who's_Afraid_of_Math_Two_Sources_of_Genetic_Variance_for_Mathematical_Anxiety","259827144_Design_of_Formal_Languages_and_Interfaces_Formal_Does_Not_Mean_Unreadable","258329472_Logic_for_Computer_Scientists","237243293_Weaving_formal_methods_into_the_undergraduate_computer_science_curriculum","232487147_The_Mathematics_Anxiety_Rating_Scale","224498701_A_Symbolic_Analysis_of_Relay_and_Switching_Circuits","224285715_Artificial_Intelligence_A_Modern_Approach","221936221_Artificial_Intelligence_A_Modern_Approach","220692531_Handbook_of_Practical_Logic_and_Automated_Reasoning","220102642_On_the_correctness_of_upper_layers_of_automotive_systems","200044349_Artificial_Intelligence_A_Modern_Approach","2531562_Logic_in_Computer_Science"]}
