{"id":"239170417_Vehicle_Routing_with_Time_Windows_and_Split_Deliveries","abstract":"In this presentation, we consider the Split Delivery Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (SDVRPTW) in which the delivery to a customer can be split between any number of vehicles. This problem has not been extensively studied in the literature. The main con- tribution of this paper is a Branch and Price approach for solving the SDVRPTW without imposing restrictions on the split delivery options. The computational results show that this approach works well and that split delivery can lead to significant improvements in terms of cost and number of vehicles used.","authors":["Dominique Feillet","Pierre J.
