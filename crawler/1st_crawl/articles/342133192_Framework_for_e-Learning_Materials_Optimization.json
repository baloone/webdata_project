{"id":"342133192_Framework_for_e-Learning_Materials_Optimization","abstract":"Creating educational materials (activities, e-books etc.) in each e-learning course can be divided into 2 main parts. The first can be defined as a compilation of ideas and information that we want to pass on to the student. This section of building e-learning materials process is very abstract and correct selection of what we want to teach the students is highly delicate and depends on teacher’s skills and didactic principles. The second phase is also important but it can be formalized. Main aim of this paper is to define and confirms a set of formal rules compiled into framework which can be used as a tool for building e-learning materials. We assume that the rules presented in this paper can be used for each e-learning platform. To confirm validity of defined rules we integrated these rules into module on LMS Moodle and part of this paper is proposed experiment carried out on the same platform","authors":["Dominik Halvoník","Jozef Kapusta"],"meta":["June 2020International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning (iJET) 15(11):67","DOI:10.3991/ijet.v15i11.12721"],"references":["337799880_The_Optimum_Equilibrium_when_Using_Experiments_in_Teaching_-_Where_Virtual_and_Real_Labs_Stand_in_Science_and_Engineering_Teaching_Practice","337799518_Development_of_a_Quiz_-_Implementation_of_a_Self-_Assessment_Tool_and_its_Integration_in_Moodle","337646467_Teachers'_Views_on_the_Availability_of_Web_20_Tools_in_Education","313872357_Gamifying_education_what_is_known_what_is_believed_and_what_remains_uncertain_a_critical_review","220140334_Comparing_e-Learning_tools'_success_The_case_of_instructor-student_interactive_vs_self-paced_tools","344873844_Technology_e-learning_and_Distance_Education","309776631_Identification_of_Relevant_and_Redundant_Automatic_Metrics_for_MT_Evaluation","288657179_Analysis_of_Stakeholders'_Behaviour_Depending_on_Time_in_Virtual_Learning_Environment","31914754_E-education_Design_and_Evaluation_for_Teaching_and_Learning"]}
