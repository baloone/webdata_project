We focus on the influence of network topology on the performance of seeding strategies. The classic independent cascade model (ICM) is adopted to represent the spreading process. We examine the centrality measuresâ€”degree, K-shell, and H-index in several real networks and confirm that degree is a good indicator for spreading efficiency. Scale-free networks with tunable parameters such as power-law exponent, density, and assortativity coefficient are constructed as the testbed of the study. By simulations, we find that the advantage of sequential seeding strategy is large in a degree-heterogeneous network with relatively small average degree and large assortativity coefficient.","authors":["Qipeng Liu","Tao Hong"],"meta":["October 2018Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications 508:10-17","DOI:10.1016/j.physa.2018.05.057"],"references":[]}
