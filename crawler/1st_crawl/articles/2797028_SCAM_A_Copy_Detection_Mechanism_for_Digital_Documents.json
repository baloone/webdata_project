{"id":"2797028_SCAM_A_Copy_Detection_Mechanism_for_Digital_Documents","abstract":"Copy detection in Digital Libraries may provide the necessary guarantees for publishers and newsfeed services to offer valuable on-line data. We consider the case for a registration server that maintains registered documents against which new documents can be checked for overlap. In this paper we present a new scheme for detecting copies based on comparing the word frequency occurrences of the new document against those of registered documents. We also report on an experimental comparison between our proposed scheme and COPS [6], a detection scheme based on sentence overlap. The tests involve over a million comparisons of netnews articles and show that in general the new scheme performs better in detecting documents that have partial overlap.
