{"id":"272195508_Partition_into_Heapable_Sequences_Heap_Tableaux_and_a_Multiset_Extension_of_Hammersley's_Process","abstract":"We investigate partitioning of integer sequences into heapable subsequences\n(previously defined and established by Mitzenmacher et al). We show that an\nextension of patience sorting computes the decomposition into a minimal number\nof heapable subsequences (MHS). We connect this parameter to an interactive\nparticle system, a multiset extension of Hammersley's process, and investigate\nits expected value on a random permutation. In contrast with the (well studied)\ncase of the longest increasing subsequence, we bring experimental evidence that\nthe correct asymptotic scaling is $\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\cdot \\ln(n)$. Finally\nwe give a heap-based extension of Young tableaux, prove a hook inequality and\nan extension of the Robinson-Schensted correspondence.","authors":["Gabriel Istrate","Cosmin Bonchi≈ü"],"meta":["February 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-19929-0_22","SourcearXiv","Conference: Annual Symposium on Combinatorial Pattern Matching"],"references":["267385007_The_Hiring_Problem_and_Permutations","302174239_Longest_increasing_and_decreasing_subsequences_Canad","293092318_The_surprising_mathematics_of_longest_increasing_subsequences","265423473_The_art_of_computer_programming_Vol_IV_3_parts","262155109_Satisfiability_and_The_Art_of_Computer_Programming","245340494_Longest_increasing_subsequences_From_patience_sorting_to_the_Baik-Deift-Johansson_theorem","245000408_A_Probabilistic_Proof_of_a_Formula_for_the_Number_of_Young_Tableaux_of_a_Given_Shape","243770699_Asymptotics_of_the_Plancherel_measure_of_the_symmetric_group_and_the_limit_form_of_Young_tableaux","243766529_Average-Case_Analysis_of_Algorithms_on_Sequences","243096681_Patience_Sorting"]}
