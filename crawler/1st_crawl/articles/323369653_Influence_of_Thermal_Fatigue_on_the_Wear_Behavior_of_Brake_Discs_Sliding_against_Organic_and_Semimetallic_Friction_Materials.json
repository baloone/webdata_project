{"id":"323369653_Influence_of_Thermal_Fatigue_on_the_Wear_Behavior_of_Brake_Discs_Sliding_against_Organic_and_Semimetallic_Friction_Materials","abstract":"In this paper, brake discs are exposed to high thermal stress, causing thermal fatigue damage. The aim of this work is to study the evolution of the wear behaviour of brake disc materials, such as cast iron, chromium steel and the metal matrix composite, under the influence of thermal fatigue. The brake disc specimens are heated and then cooled rapidly. Then, wear tests are carried out using a pin-on-disc type tribometer. Organic and semi-metallic friction materials are used for all wear tests. The results show that thermal fatigue affects the structure of the contact surfaces of all of the disc specimens by increasing their roughness. Furthermore, the wear rate of the friction materials increased, except a reduction of the wear rate is noted for the semi-metallic friction material rubbing against cast iron. Moreover, the thermal fatigue has no significant influence on the coefficient of friction. The worn surface of the metal matrix composite sliding against semi-metallic friction material is characterized by abrasive and adhesive wear mechanisms.","authors":["M.
