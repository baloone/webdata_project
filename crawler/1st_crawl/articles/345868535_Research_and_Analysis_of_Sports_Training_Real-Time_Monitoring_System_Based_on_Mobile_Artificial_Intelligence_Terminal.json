{"id":"345868535_Research_and_Analysis_of_Sports_Training_Real-Time_Monitoring_System_Based_on_Mobile_Artificial_Intelligence_Terminal","abstract":"With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, related technologies and applications come into being, and industries based on artificial intelligence are booming, among which image recognition and target tracking technologies are widely used in various fields, especially in the fields of security monitoring and augmented reality. In this paper, combined with the characteristics of athletes, based on mobile artificial intelligence terminal technology, the C/S mode of athlete training process monitoring system is developed and designed, which uses GPS to obtain the real-time position information of athletes and provide real-time guidance for athletes. In order to reveal the changing rules of various indexes of athletes in training state, the author makes synchronous tracking analysis from the aspects of individual sports function characteristics of athletes, training plan arrangement of coaches, brain function state, routine physiological and biochemical indexes, nutrition regulation, and injury conditions.","authors":["Biao Ma","Shangqi Nie","Minghui Ji","Jeho Song"],"meta":["September 2020Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing 2020(6):1-10","DOI:10.1155/2020/8879616"],"references":["333339302_Special_Issue_on_Artificial_Intelligence_and_Machine_Learning_for_Networking_and_Communications_Guest_Editorial","323332479_Artificial_intelligence_Why_we_must_get_it_right","323283173_Artificial_Intelligence_and_brain","321503807_Artificial_Intelligence_and_Autonomous_Devices_in_Legal_Context_on_Development_of_the_First_Russian_Law_on_Robotics","317821828_Explanation_in_Artificial_Intelligence_Insights_from_the_Social_Sciences","305273275_Artificial_intelligence_in_clinical_medicine_and_dentistry","334830600_Artificial_Intelligence_in_Psychomotor_Learning_Modeling_Human_Motion_from_Inertial_Sensor_Data","331537658_Artificial_Intelligence_and_Applications_in_PMR","325382631_Is_artificial_intelligence_a_help_or_hindrance","312035909_A_Limb-Based_Graphical_Model_for_Human_Pose_Estimation"]}
