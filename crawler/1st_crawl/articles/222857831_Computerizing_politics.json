{"id":"222857831_Computerizing_politics","abstract":"A political proposal for changing our voting procedures by use of computers is presented. Individuals would be able to cast direct votes on laws if they wish, or designate congressmen to cast their votes. Individual congressmen would have different numbers of votes depending on who was backing of them at that particular point in time. The procedure would raise various problems which are discussed at length.","authors":["Gordon Tullock"],"meta":["August 1992Mathematical and Computer Modelling 16(8-9):59-65","DOI:10.1016/0895-7177(92)90087-2"],"references":["24107734_A_New_and_Superior_Process_for_Making_Social_Choices","305941171_The_Chairman's_Problem","285032854_New_interactive_TV_threatens_the_bliss_of_couch_potatoes","275766583_Seminar_Exercise_The_Chairman's_Problem","248124802_Toward_a_Mathematics_of_Politics"]}
