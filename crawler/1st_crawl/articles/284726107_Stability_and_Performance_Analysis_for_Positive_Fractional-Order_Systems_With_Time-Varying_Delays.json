A necessary and sufficient condition is firstly given to characterize the positivity of continuous-time fractional-order systems with bounded time-varying delays. Moreover, by exploiting the monotonic and asymptotic property of the constant delay system by virtue of the positivity, and comparing the trajectory of the time-varying delay system with that of the constant delay system, it is proved that the asymptotic stability of positive fractional-order systems is not sensitive to the magnitude of delays. In addition, it is shown that the L∞-gain of a positive fractional-order system is independent of the magnitude of delays and fully determined by the system matrices. Finally, a numerical example is given to show the validity of the theoretical results.","authors":["Jun Shen","James Lam"],"meta":["November 2015IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control 61(9)","DOI:10.1109/TAC.2015.2504516"],"references":["275511373_-Gain_Analysis_for_Positive_Linear_Systems_With_Unbounded_Time-Varying_Delays","264124678_Stabilization_of_Continuous-Time_Fractional_Positive_Systems_by_Using_a_Lyapunov_Function","307685451_Stability_Tests_of_Positive_Fractional_Continuous-time_Linear_Systems_with_Delays","287051555_Memoryless_control_to_drive_states_of_delayed_continuous-time_systems_within_the_nonnegative_orthant","285632066_A_note_on_the_complete_monotonicity_of_the_generalized_Mittag-Leffler_function","269262494_Memoryless_Control_to_Drive_States_of_Delayed_Continuous-Time_Systems_within_the_Nonnegative_Orthant","267660039_Compartmental_analysis_in_biology_and_medicine_Reprint_of_the_2nd_ed","267070499_Selected_Problems_of_Fractional_System_Theory","264257367_Descriptor_Fractional_Linear_Systems_with_Regular_Pencils","262205073_Technical_communique_Mittag-Leffler_stability_of_fractional_order_nonlinear_dynamic_systems"]}
