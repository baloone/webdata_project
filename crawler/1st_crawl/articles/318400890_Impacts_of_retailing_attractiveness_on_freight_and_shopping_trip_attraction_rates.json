{"id":"318400890_Impacts_of_retailing_attractiveness_on_freight_and_shopping_trip_attraction_rates","abstract":"This paper provides an integrated framework for assessing the relations between retailing attractiveness and both freight and shopping trips generated in urban areas. The proposed framework deploys a trip attraction (FTA) and a shopping trip attraction (STA) model then carries out a retailing attractiveness analysis. First, an overview on trip generation and attractiveness related to retailing is made to motivate and position the present work. The paper introduces then the methodological framework and describes the FTA and STA models as well as the attractiveness indicator proposed. After that, both FTA and STA flows are assessed on Lyon's conurbation. Then, the relations between retailing attractiveness and retailing-based trip attraction rates are analysed on the basis of linear regression analysis. The results show that both FTA and STA rates have a direct relation with retailing attractiveness but the category of urban space needs also to be included in those analyses. Finally, as a conclusion, main implications of the proposed framework are addressed for both researchers and practitioners.","authors":["Jesus Gonzalez-Feliu","Carlos Peris-Pla"],"meta":["July 2017Research in Transportation Business and Management 24","DOI:10.1016/j.rtbm.2017.07.004","Project: ANNONA - Decision Support for Sustainable Urban Logistics Schemes"],"references":["312919042_Analysis_of_Freight_Trip_Generation_Model_for_Food_and_Beverage_in_Belo_Horizonte_Brazil","299459927_Connecting_Demand_Estimation_and_Spatial_Category_Models_for_Urban_Freight_First_Attempt_and_Research_Implications","284720137_Evaluating_the_impacts_of_urban_freight_traffic_Application_of_micro-simulation_at_a_large_establishment","272370162_Freight-Trip_Generation_Model_Predicting_Urban_Freight_Weekly_Parking_Demand_from_Retail_Establishment_Characteristics","270650038_Vehicle_Routing_Problems_for_City_Logistics","269389149_Models_of_Choice_between_Shopping_and_E-Shopping","269289971_An_exploratory_analysis_of_spatial_effects_on_freight_trip_attraction","267510910_An_emission_model_as_an_alternative_to_O-D_matrix_in_urban_goods_transport_modeling","258121233_Transferability_of_Freight_Trip_Generation_Models","258121011_Estimated_Generation_of_Freight_Trips_Based_on_Land_Use","257726904_A_simulation_framework_for_evaluating_the_impacts_of_urban_goods_transport_in_terms_of_road_occupancy","257715634_City_Logistics_Modeling_Efforts_Trends_and_Gaps_-_A_Review","257715633_Modeling_Urban_Goods_Movement_How_to_be_Oriented_with_so_Many_Approaches","248973845_Understanding_the_Movement_of_Goods_Not_People_Issues_Evidence_and_Potential","248707449_A_modelling_system_for_estimating_freight_quantities_attracted_by_cities","228745464_A_behavioral_modeling_in_micro-simulation_for_urban_freight_transportation","228349968_Commodity_Distribution_Model_Incorporating_Spatial_Interactions_for_Urban_Freight_Movement","227580431_Urban_Freight_Transport_Demand_Modelling_a_State_of_the_Art","225234461_A_modelling_system_to_simulate_goods_movements_at_an_urban_scale","50416656_Urban_freight_establishment_and_tour_based_surveys_for_policy_oriented_modelling","46478573_End_consumer_goods_movement_generation_in_French_medium_urban_areas","45111356_Freight_Distribution_Systems_with_Cross_Docking_A_Multidisciplinary_Analysis","318402206_DEMAND_FOR_URBAN_GOODS_VEHICLE_TRIPS","313558824_Urban_freight_movement_modelling","286051820_The_environmental_assessment_of_urban_goods_movement","285632551_Measurement_of_urban_commodity_movements","284160950_Accessible_accessibility_research_challenges","276466968_A_time-dependent_freight_tour_synthesis_model","275851433_Transport_and_Logistics_Demand","273369546_Estimation_of_Daily_Vehicle_Flows_for_Urban_Freight_Deliveries","266589397_Location_decision_making_The_case_of_retail_service_development_in_a_closed_population","259884353_Urban_freight_demand_forecasting_A_mixed_quantitydeliveryvehicle-based_model","246097108_Estimating_truck_travel_patterns_in_Urban_areas","245291962_Modeling_Freight_Delivery_Flows_Missing_Link_of_Urban_Transport_Analysis","239424344_The_distribution_of_truck_trips_and_commodity_flow_in_urban_areas_A_gravity_model_analysis","231094740_Freight_Generation_Freight_Trip_Generation_and_Perils_of_Using_Constant_Trip_Rates","226726103_Analysis_of_Location_of_Large-area_Shopping_Centres_A_Probabilistic_Gravity_Model_for_the_Halle-LeipzigArea","226702265_Commercial_Vehicle_Empty_Trip_Models_With_Variable_Zero_Order_Empty_Trip_Probabilities","226232047_An_application_of_continuous_spatial_models_to_freight_movements_in_Greater_London","222908542_Accessibility_evaluation_of_land-use_and_transport_strategies_Review_and_research_directions","222523543_Goods_transport_in_large_European_cities_Difficult_to_organize_difficult_to_modernize","222221687_Tour-based_microsimulation_of_urban_commercial_movements","23527094_Household_trip_generation_choice--Alternative_empirical_approaches","5153127_A_Multicommodity_Integrated_Freight_Origin-destination_Synthesis_Model"]}
