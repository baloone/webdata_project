{"id":"261463476_Compositional_verification_of_sensor_software_using_UPPAAL","abstract":"Verification of wireless sensor networks has long been performed for communication protocols and for network-level behavior over multiple nodes, but not for the basic properties that should hold at a single node. Testing sensor networks, however, is extremely hard due to the lack of controllability, and complex simulation setups are often too expensive to undertake. Thus, verification of properties for a sensor node is desirable. We created a verification methodology that extracts timed models of the high-level behavior of a wireless sensor and then uses UPPAAL to verify both functional and non-functional (timed) properties for the sensor. This verification capability will enhance the trustworthiness of deployed sensor networks.","authors":["Mustafa Hammad","Jonathan Cook"],"meta":["November 2012","DOI:10.1109/ISSRE.2012.5","Conference: Software Reliability Engineering (ISSRE), 2012 IEEE 23rd International Symposium on"],"references":["269031340_The_nesC_Language_A_Holistic_Approach_to_Networked_Embedded_Systems","238102803_The_nesC_Language_A_Holistic_Approach_to_Networked_Embedded_Systems_httpnesccsourceforgenet","224588161_Lightweight_Deployable_Software_Monitoring_for_Sensor_Networks","221421853_UPPAAL_-_a_Tool_Suite_for_Automatic_Verification_of_Real-Time_Systems","216806788_Software_verification_for_TinyOS","30815856_Runtime_Verification_for_Wireless_Sensor_Network_Applications","2528818_Lifetime_Analysis_of_a_Sensor_Network_with_Hybrid_Automata_Modelling","2440239_System_Architecture_Directions_for_Networked_Sensors","290109872_TOSSIM","248870437_Life_Death_and_the_Critical_Transition_Finding_Liveness_Bugs_in_Systems_Code","221284299_Deriving_State_Machines_from_TinyOS_Programs_Using_Symbolic_Execution","221283997_T-check_bug_finding_for_sensor_networks","221190145_Real-Time_Logic_Verification_of_a_Wireless_Sensor_Network","221091372_Efficient_memory_safety_for_TinyOS","215619098_TOSSIM_Accurate_and_scalable_simulation_of_entire_TinyOS_applications","50521140_T-check_bug_finding_for_sensor_networks","4149788_SYS1_Avrora_Scalable_Sensor_Network_Simulation_with_Precise_Timing","2696637_UPPAAL_---_a_Tool_Suite_for_Automatic_Verification_of_Real--Time_Systems"]}
