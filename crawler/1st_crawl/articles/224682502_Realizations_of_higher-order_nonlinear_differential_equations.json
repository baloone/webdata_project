{"id":"224682502_Realizations_of_higher-order_nonlinear_differential_equations","abstract":"We discuss the realization problem for nonlinear systems which are not given by a nonlinear input-output map, but as a set of smooth higher-order differential equations involving the inputs and outputs. We show that under general conditions the existence of realizations involving auxiliary driving variables is guaranteed, but that for input-output realizations extra integrability conditions have to be imposed. The realization procedure uses the concept of zero dynamics which is briefly discussed.","authors":["Arjan van der Schaft"],"meta":["January 1987","DOI:10.1109/CDC.1986.267207","SourceIEEE Xplore","Conference: Decision and Control, 1986 25th IEEE Conference onVolume: 25"],"references":["242655737_Algebraic_Theory_for_Multivariable_Linear_Systems","44528897_Linear_multivariable_systems_W_A_Wolovich","3028105_Smooth_Representation_of_Systems_with_Differentiated_Inputs"]}
