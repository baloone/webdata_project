{"id":"338313285_Microgrids_Overview_and_guidelines_for_practical_implementations_and_operation","abstract":"A microgrid is a small portion of a power distribution system with distributed generators along with energy storage devices and controllable loads which can give rise to a self-sufficient energy system. From the utility grid side, a microgrid is seen as an equivalent generator that is able to seamlessly disconnect and operate autonomously once a fault affects the main grid. The design, installation and operation of such systems lead to dealing with a number of technical and operational challenges including control, protection and infrastructure requirements. To help designers and researchers address these challenges and draw potential recommendations for practical microgrid implementations, in this paper a review of the main design features of existing microgrids is undertaken, also in light of the experience gained during the realization of the Prince Lab microgrid at Polytechnic University of Bari, Italy. The main control functions required to guarantee an economic, reliable and secure operation of a microgrid are also reviewed. Finally, key practical guidelines for monitoring, operation and implementation of microgrids are provided.","authors":["A.
