{"id":"265511949_Deciding_positivity_of_multisymmetric_polynomials","abstract":"The question how to certify non-negativity of a polynomial function lies at\nthe heart of Real Algebra and also has important applications to Optimization.\nIn this article we investigate the question of non-negativity in the context of\nmultisymmetric polynomials. In this setting we generalize the characterization\nof non-negative symmetric polynomials by adapting the method of proof developed\nby the second author. One particular case where our results can be applied is\nthe question of certifying that a (multi-)symmetric polynomial defines a convex\nfunction. As a direct corollary of our main result we are able to derive that\nin the case of (multi-)symmetric polynomials of a fixed degree testing for\nconvexity can be done in a time which is polynomial in the number of variables.\nThis is in sharp contrast to the general case, where it is known that testing\nfor convexity is NP-hard already in the case of quartic polynomials.","authors":["Paul GÃ¶rlach","Cordian Riener","Tillmann Weisser"],"meta":["September 2014Journal of Symbolic Computation 74","DOI:10.1016/j.jsc.2015.10.001","SourcearXiv","Project: Symmetry in Polynomial Optimization and Algebra"],"references":["256758891_On_the_positivity_of_symmetric_polynomial_functions_Part_I_General_results","229176493_On_the_positivity_of_symmetric_polynomial_functions_Part_II_Lattice_general_results_and_positivity_criteria_for_degrees_4_and_5","225846570_Even_symmetric_sextics","224951983_Symmetric_Non-Negative_Forms_and_Sums_of_Squares","47868713_NP-hardness_of_Deciding_Convexity_of_Quartic_Polynomials_and_Related_Problems","2112878_The_ring_of_multisymmetric_functions","267438361_When_is_the_algebra_of_multisymmetric_polynomials_generated_by_the_elementary_multisymmetric_polynomialsPH","267007880_Invariants_of_Finite_Groups_Generated_by_Reflections","266221953_Multisymmetric_functions","266071679_Deciding_positivity_of_real_polynomials","265295246_Symmetric_semi-algebraic_sets_and_non-negativity_of_symmetric_polynomials","259441232_Bounding_the_equivariant_Betti_numbers_of_symmetric_semi-algebraic_sets","251382871_Uber_symmetrische_Functionen_von_mehreren_Reihen_von_Vernderlichen","243020659_Real_Even_Symmetric_Ternary_Forms","242972970_Die_Relationen_welche_zwischen_den_elementaren_symmetrischen_Functionen_bestehen","233968788_Positive_symmetric_functions","227004014_Forms_derived_from_the_arithmetic-geometric_inequality","225234260_Some_NP-Complete_Problems_in_Quadratic_and_Nonlinear_Programming","45897332_On_the_degree_and_half_degree_principle_for_symmetric_polynomials","3593037_On_the_combinatorial_and_algebraic_complexity_of_quantifierelimination","2131614_Real_solutions_to_equations_from_geometry"]}
