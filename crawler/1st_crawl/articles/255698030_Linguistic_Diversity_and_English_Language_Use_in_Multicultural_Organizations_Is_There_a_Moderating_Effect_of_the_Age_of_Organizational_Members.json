{"id":"255698030_Linguistic_Diversity_and_English_Language_Use_in_Multicultural_Organizations_Is_There_a_Moderating_Effect_of_the_Age_of_Organizational_Members","abstract":"Two great human resource management challenges face organizations in many parts of the world. The workforce is aging leaving fewer young people to take over. At the same time, globalization leads to a pressure for internationalization with great consequences for internal collaboration in many organizations. Accordingly, the link between employee age and language use is of increasing importance. In this study, we report on the findings of a survey using responses from 489 members of Danish multicultural organizations. We studied the effect of linguistic diversity on English language communication as well as the moderating effect of respondentsâ€™ age. We found linguistic diversity to have positive associations with the two English language communication variables. We also found age to moderate the relationship between linguistic diversity and perceived use of English language by management. Since organizational language use and language management are an understudied topic, the results could have important theoretical and practical implications.","authors":["Jakob Lauring","Jan Selmer"],"meta":["May 2013The International Journal of Human Resource Management 24(10)","DOI:10.1080/09585192.2012.723020"],"references":["285760079_Language_Diversity_in_International_Management_Teams","284510777_Age_and_work_behaviour_Physical_attributes_cognitive_abilities_knowledge_personality_traits_and_motives","274583905_Organizational_demography_The_differential_effects_of_age_and_tenure_distributions_on_technical_communication","259461922_Demographic_Diversity_and_Faultlines_The_Compositional_DYnamics_of_Organizational_Groups","257492843_When_global_virtual_teams_share_knowledge_Media_richness_cultural_difference_and_language_commonality","254300759_The_relationship_between_attitudes_toward_diversity_management_in_the_Southwest_USA_and_the_GLOBE_study_cultural_preferences","254299104_Host_country_language_ability_and_expatriate_adjustment_The_moderating_effect_of_language_difficulty","254081335_Multicultural_Organizations_Common_Language_and_Group_Cohesiveness","278900266_A_threat_in_the_air_-_How_stereotypes_shape_intellectual_identity_and_performance","269615006_Input_and_long-term_effects_of_starting_age_in_foreign_language_learning"]}
