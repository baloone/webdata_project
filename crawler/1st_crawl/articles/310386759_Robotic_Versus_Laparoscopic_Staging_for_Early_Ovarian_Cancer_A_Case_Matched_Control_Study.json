{"id":"310386759_Robotic_Versus_Laparoscopic_Staging_for_Early_Ovarian_Cancer_A_Case_Matched_Control_Study","abstract":"Study objective: \nThis study aims to evaluate the feasibility, surgical outcome and oncological results observed after robotic staging compared to conventional laparoscopic staging for patients with early-stage ovarian cancer (EOC) patients.\n\nDesign: \nRetrospective cohort study (Canadian Task Force classification II-2).\n\nSetting: \nCatholic University of the Sacred Hearth, Rome, Italy.\n\nPatients: \n96 patients underwent minimally invasive staging for presumed stage I ovarian cancer: 32 underwent robotic approach (Cases), and 64 underwent laparoscopic approach (Controls).\n\nMeasure: \nments and Results: There was no statistically significant difference between the two approaches with regard to final FIGO stage, histology and grade of tumors. In the whole series 15 patients (15.6%) were upstaged, with no statistically significant difference between the two groups. Median number of pelvic lymph nodes removed was 14 (range 3-42) and 11 (range 2-29) in the robotic and laparoscopic group (p value= 0.235), respectively. Median number of aortic lymph nodes removed was 11 (range 3-26) and 12 (range 1-39) in the robotic and laparoscopic group (p value= 0.263), respectively. Operative time was significantly shorter in the robotic group compared to the laparoscopic group (p value= 0.043), while the amount of estimated blood loss was similar (p value= 0.691). No difference was found in terms of early and postoperative complications. Overall, 72 patients were considered as requiring adjuvant treatment. Two patients experienced peritoneal recurrence.\n\nConclusions: \nThe present study suggests that there is no relevant difference between robotic and laparoscopic approach in staging EOC. Further prospective trials are needed to confirm our results.","authors":["Valerio Gallotta","Carla Cicero","Carmine Conte","Giuseppe Vizzielli"],"meta":["November 2016Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology 24(2)","DOI:10.1016/j.jmig.2016.11.004"],"references":["299601743_Feasibility_and_surgical_outcomes_of_conventional_and_robot-assisted_laparoscopy_for_early-stage_ovarian_cancer_a_retrospective_multicenter_analysis","281343512_Comparison_of_the_prognosis_and_recurrence_of_apparent_early-stage_ovarian_tumors_treated_with_laparoscopy_and_laparotomy_A_meta-analysis_of_clinical_studies","280865841_Use_of_the_new_Da_Vinci_XiR_during_robotic_rectal_resection_for_cancer_technical_considerations_and_early_experience","225156946_Ergonomic_user_comfort_and_performance_in_standard_and_robot-assisted_laparoscopic_surgery","225073686_Robotic_Transperitoneal_Aortic_Lymphadenectomy_in_Gynecologic_Cancer_A_New_Robotic_Surgical_Technique_and_Review_of_the_Literature","288074673_Total_robotic_radical_rectal_resection_with_da_Vinci_Xi_system_Single_docking_single_phase_technique","258688243_Staging_Classification_for_Cancer_of_the_Ovary_Fallopian_Tube_and_Peritoneum","23308038_Laparoscopy_versus_laparotomy_for_FIGO_Stage_I_ovarian_cancer"]}
