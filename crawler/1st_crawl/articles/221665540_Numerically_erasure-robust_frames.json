{"id":"221665540_Numerically_erasure-robust_frames","abstract":"Given a channel with additive noise and adversarial erasures, the task is to\ndesign a frame that allows for stable signal reconstruction from transmitted\nframe coefficients. To meet these specifications, we introduce numerically\nerasure-robust frames. We first consider a variety of constructions, including\nrandom frames, equiangular tight frames and group frames. Later, we show that\narbitrarily large erasure rates necessarily induce numerical instability in\nsignal reconstruction. We conclude with a few observations, including some\nimplications for maximal equiangular tight frames and sparse frames.","authors":["Matthew Fickus","Dustin G.
