{"id":"330778402_OpenHI_-_An_open_source_framework_for_annotating_histopathological_image","abstract":"Histopathological images carry informative cellular visual phenotypes and have been digitalized in huge amount in medical institutes. However, the lack of software for annotating the specialized images has been a hurdle of fully exploiting the images for educating and researching, and enabling intelligent systems for automatic diagnosis or phenotype-genotype association study. This paper proposes an open-source web framework, OpenHI, for the whole-slide image annotation. The proposed framework could be utilized for simultaneous collaborative or crowd-sourcing annotation with standardized semantic enrichment at a pixel-level precision. Meanwhile, our accurate virtual magnification indicator provides annotators a crucial reference for deciding the grading of each region. In testing, the framework can responsively annotate the acquired whole-slide images from TCGA project and provide efficient annotation which is precise and semantically meaningful. OpenHI is an open-source framework thus it can be extended to support the annotation of whole-slide images from different source with different oncological types. It is publicly available at https://gitlab.com/BioAI/OpenHI/. The framework may facilitate the creation of large-scale precisely annotated histopathological image datasets.","authors":["Pargorn Puttapirat","Haichuan Zhang","Yuchen Lian","Chunbao Wang"],"meta":["January 2019","DOI:10.1109/BIBM.2018.8621393","Conference: 2018 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)At: Madrid, Spain","Project: Open Histopathological Image"],"references":["329610370_Hands-on_Image_Processing_in_Python","321438791_QuPath_Open_source_software_for_digital_pathology_image_analysis","320176400_Multi-Instance_Multi-Label_Learning_for_Multi-Class_Classification_of_Whole_Slide_Breast_Histopathology_Images","320105945_Whole_Slide_Imaging_Versus_Microscopy_for_Primary_Diagnosis_in_Surgical_Pathology_A_Multicenter_Blinded_Randomized_Noninferiority_Study_of_1992_Cases_Pivotal_Study","318253293_SlideJ_An_ImageJ_plugin_for_automated_processing_of_whole_slide_images","317301118_Large_scale_tissue_histopathology_image_classification_segmentation_and_visualization_via_deep_convolutional_activation_features","316780534_Large_scale_digital_prostate_pathology_image_analysis_combining_feature_extraction_and_deep_neural_network","285574071_Scalable_analysis_of_Big_pathology_image_data_cohorts_using_efficient_methods_and_high-performance_computing_strategies","283756401_The_International_Society_of_Urological_Pathology_ISUP_grading_system_for_renal_cell_carcinoma_and_other_prognostic_parameters","272514319_Review_The_Cancer_Genome_Atlas_TCGA_an_immeasurable_source_of_knowledge","272386491_The_Genotype-Tissue_Expression_GTEx_Project_Linking_Clinical_Data_with_Molecular_Analysis_to_Advance_Personalized_Medicine","271140340_Novel_genotype-phenotype_associations_in_human_cancers_enabled_by_advanced_molecular_platforms_and_computational_analysis_of_whole_slide_images","264197576_scikit-image_Image_processing_in_Python","258639778_OpenSlide_A_vendor-neutral_software_foundation_for_digital_pathology","257251347_Relationship_between_magnification_and_resolution_in_digital_pathology_systems","255986689_Pathology_imaging_informatics_for_quantitative_analysis_of_whole-slide_images","253335545_Cancer_Digital_Slide_Archive_an_informatics_resource_to_support_integrated_in_silico_analysis_of_TCGA_pathology_data","225069465_SLIC_Superpixels_Compared_to_State-of-the-Art_Superpixel_Methods","331377367_Predicting_breast_tumor_proliferation_from_whole-slide_images_The_TUPAC16_challenge","321759252_Diagnostic_Assessment_of_Deep_Learning_Algorithms_for_Detection_of_Lymph_Node_Metastases_in_Women_With_Breast_Cancer","320763666_The_Digital_Slide_Archive_A_Software_Platform_for_Management_Integration_and_Analysis_of_Histology_for_Cancer_Research","279992055_The_ImageJ_ecosystem_An_open_platform_for_biomedical_image_analysis","269725439_Whole-slide_imaging_Widening_the_scope_of_cytopathology","266085049_Concordance_between_digital_pathology_and_light_microscopy_in_general_surgical_pathology_A_pilot_study_of_100_cases","50265487_Clinical_Examination_and_Validation_of_Primary_Diagnosis_in_Anatomic_Pathology_Using_Whole_Slide_Digital_Images"]}
