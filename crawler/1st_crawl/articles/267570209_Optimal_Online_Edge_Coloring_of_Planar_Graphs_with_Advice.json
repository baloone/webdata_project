{"id":"267570209_Optimal_Online_Edge_Coloring_of_Planar_Graphs_with_Advice","abstract":"We study the amount of knowledge about the future that an online algorithm\nneeds to color the edges of a graph optimally (i.e. using as few colors as\npossible). Assume that along with each edge, the online algorithm receives a\nfixed number of advice bits. For graphs of maximum degree $\\Delta$, it follows\nfrom Vizing's Theorem that $\\lceil \\log(\\Delta+1)\\rceil$ bits per edge suffice\nto achieve optimality. We show that even for bipartite graphs, $\\Omega(\\log\n\\Delta)$ bits per edge are in fact necessary. However, we also show that there\nis an online algorithm which can color the edges of a $d$-degenerate graph\noptimally using $O(\\log d)$ bits of advice per edge. It follows that for planar\ngraphs and other graph classes of bounded degeneracy, only $O(1)$ bits per edge\nare needed, independently of how large $\\Delta$ is.","authors":["Jesper W.
