{"id":"303499030_Untangling_two_systems_of_noncrossing_curves","abstract":"We consider two systems (α\n1, …, α\nm\n) and (β\n1, …,β\nn\n) of simple curves drawn on a compact two-dimensional surface M with boundary.\nEach α\ni\nand each β\nj\nis either an arc meeting the boundary of M at its two endpoints, or a closed curve. The α\ni\nare pairwise disjoint except for possibly sharing endpoints, and similarly for the β\nj\n. We want to “untangle” the β\nj\nfrom the ai by a self-homeomorphism of M; more precisely, we seek a homeomorphism φ:M→M fixing the boundary of M pointwise such that the total number of crossings of the ai with the φ(β\nj\n) is as small as possible. This problem is motivated by an application in the algorithmic theory of embeddings and 3-manifolds.\nWe prove that if M is planar, i.e., a sphere with h ≥ 0 boundary components (“holes”), then O(mn) crossings can be achieved (independently of h), which is asymptotically tight, as an easy lower bound shows.\nIn general, for an arbitrary (orientable or nonorientable) surface M with h holes and of (orientable or nonorientable) genus g ≥ 0, we obtain an O((m + n)4) upper bound, again independent of h and g.\nThe proofs rely, among other things, on a result concerning simultaneous planar drawings of graphs by Erten and Kobourov.","authors":["Jiří Matoušek","Eric Sedgwick","Martin Tancer","Uli Wagner"],"meta":["May 2016Israel Journal of Mathematics 212(1):37-79","DOI:10.1007/s11856-016-1294-9"],"references":["260039404_Embeddability_in_the_3-sphere_is_decidable","236635245_Explicit_bounds_for_graph_minors","224849118_Simultaneous_Embedding_of_Planar_Graphs","220983560_Computational_Complexity_of_Combinatorial_Surfaces","268653301_Conway's_ZIP_proof","265158364_A_primer_on_mapping_class_groups_PMS-49","245040460_A_Representation_of_Orientable_Combinatorial_3-Manifolds","238680661_Classical_Topology_Combinatorial_Group_Theory","223153450_String_graphs_requiring_exponential_representations","222577908_Recognizing_String_Graphs_in_NP","222300058_Decision_problems_in_the_space_of_Dehn_fillings","220770095_Finding_Shortest_Non-Separating_and_Non-Contractible_Cycles_for_Topologically_Embedded_Graphs","30496818_Computing_a_Canonical_Polygonal_Schema_of_an_Orientable_Triangulated_Surface","2898051_Subexponential_Parameterized_Algorithms_on_Graphs_of_Bounded-Genus_and_H-Minor-Free_Graphs","2832019_Embedding_Vertices_at_Points_Few_Bends_Suffice_for_Planar_Graphs","1739944_Hardness_of_embedding_simplicial_complexes_in_Rd"]}
