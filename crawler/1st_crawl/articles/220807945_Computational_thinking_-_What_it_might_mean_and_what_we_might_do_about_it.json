{"id":"220807945_Computational_thinking_-_What_it_might_mean_and_what_we_might_do_about_it","abstract":"Computational thinking has been promoted in recent years as a skill that is as fundamental as being able to read, write, and do arithmetic. However, what computational thinking really means remains speculative. While wonders, discussions and debates will likely continue, this article provides some analysis aimed to further the understanding of the notion. It argues that computational thinking is likely a hybrid thinking paradigm that must accommodate different thinking modes in terms of the way each would influence what we do in computation. Furthermore, the article makes an attempt to define computational thinking and connect the (potential) thinking elements to the known thinking paradigms. Finally, the author discusses some implications of the analysis.","authors":["Chenglie Hu"],"meta":["January 2011","DOI:10.1145/1999747.1999811","SourceDBLP","Conference: Proceedings of the 16th Annual SIGCSE Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education, ITiCSE 2011, Darmstadt, Germany, June 27-29, 2011"],"references":["263063836_Engineering_Design_Thinking_Teaching_and_Learning","234801018_Commonsense_Understanding_of_Concurrency_Computing_Students_and_Concert_Tickets","221538265_Thinking_about_Computational_Thinking","220427690_Is_abstraction_the_key_to_computing","220420371_Computational_thinking","4336467_Computational_thinking_and_thinking_about_computing","274813771_Questions_and_Prompts_for_Mathematical_Thinking","267121975_Erratum_Numerical_Computation_of_the_Schwarz-Christoffel_Transformation","266685988_Algorithmic_Thinking_and_Mathematical_Thinking","247663461_Studies_in_Reflecting_Abstraction","240319085_Ubiquity_symposium_'What_is_computation'_Opening_statement","225528470_It's_Mathematical_After_All-the_Nature_of_Learning_Computer_Programming","224206968_Integrating_Mathematical_Thinking_Abstract_Thinking_and_Computational_Thinking","221538105_Why_students_with_an_apparent_aptitude_for_computer_science_don't_choose_to_major_in_computer_science","3451338_Realization_of_Boolean_Functions_via_CNN_Mathematical_Theory_LSBF_and_Template_Design"]}
