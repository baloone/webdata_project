{"id":"326668706_Embodied_Cognition_and_Its_Implications_in_Education_An_Overview_of_Recent_Literature","abstract":"Embodied Cognition (EC) as a learning paradigm is based on the idea of an inseparable link between body, mind, and environment. In recent years, the advent of theoretical learning approaches around EC theory has resulted in a number of empirical studies exploring the implementation of the theory in education. This systematic literature overview identifies the mainstream of EC research and emphasizes on the implementation of the theory across learning environments. Based on a corpus of 43 manuscripts, published between 2013 and 2017, it sets out to describe the range of topics covered under the umbrella of EC and provides a holistic view of the field. The aim of the present review is to investigate the main issues in EC research related to the various learning contexts. Particularly, the study addresses the research methods and technologies that are utilized, and it also explores the integration of body into the learning context. An important finding from the overview is the potential of the theory in different educational environments and disciplines. However, there is a lack of an explicit pedagogical framework from an educational perspective for a successful implementation in various learning contexts.","authors":["Panagiotis Kosmas","Panayiotis Zaphiris"],"meta":["July 2018","DOI:10.1999/1307-6892/10009334"],"references":["334773727_Effects_of_learning_from_interaction_with_physical_or_mediated_devices","332810086_Exploring_Motion-based_Touchless_Games_for_Autistic_Children's_Learning","329078772_Implementing_embodied_learning_in_the_classroom_effects_on_children's_memory_and_language_skills","325171622_Moving_Bodies_to_Moving_Minds_A_Study_of_the_Use_of_Motion-Based_Games_in_Special_Education","319474305_Using_Embodied_Learning_Technology_to_Advance_Motor_Performance_of_Children_with_Special_Educational_Needs_and_Motor_Impairments","301223277_Rationale_and_design_of_a_randomized_controlled_trial_examining_the_effect_of_classroom-based_physical_activity_on_math_achievement","284048682_Children_with_Motor_Impairments_Play_a_Kinect_Learning_Game_First_Findings_from_a_Pilot_Case_in_an_Authentic_Classroom_Environment","281964252_Embodied_cognition_and_language_learning_in_virtual_environments","319460450_Handbook_of_research_on_educational_communications_and_technology_Fourth_edition","281773470_The_Phenomenology_of_Perception"]}
