{"id":"335072741_Understanding_the_impact_of_the_Hajj_Explaining_experiences_of_self-change_at_a_religious_mass_gathering","abstract":"Previous research has shown that participation in the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca can lead to both more positive outgroup attitudes and increased commitment to Muslim identity. We describe a survey of pilgrims (N = 1176) carried out at Mecca, during the Hajj, which tested explanations for these experiences of self‐change at the time of their occurrence. In line with contact theory, perceived cooperation among pilgrims indirectly predicted more positive outgroup attitudes (as well as enhanced Muslim identification), via identification with the crowd. In line with social identity and identity congruence explanations, positive emotional experience and the perception that the crowd embodied the Muslim value of unity predicted self‐change variables through identification with the crowd. The finding that participation in an all‐Muslim gathering increases positive views of other groups (including non‐Muslims) through identification with the crowd offers an alternative perspective to suggestions that such gatherings might encourage intolerance.
