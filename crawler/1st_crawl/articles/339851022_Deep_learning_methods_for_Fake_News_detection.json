{"id":"339851022_Deep_learning_methods_for_Fake_News_detection","abstract":"Spreading of misinformation on the web nowadays represents a serious issue, as their influence on peoples opinions may be significant. Fake news represents a specific type of misinformation. While its detection was mostly being performed manually in the past, automated methods using machine learning and related fields became more critical. On the other hand, deep learning methods became very popular and frequently used methods in the field of data analysis in recent years. The study presented in this paper deals with the detection of fake news from the textual data using deep learning techniques. Our main idea was to train different types of neural network models using both entire texts from the articles and to use just the title text. The models were trained and evaluated on the Fake News dataset obtained from the Kaggle competition.","authors":["Viera Maslej Krešňáková","Martin Sarnovsky","Peter Butka"],"meta":["November 2019","DOI:10.1109/CINTI-MACRo49179.2019.9105317","Conference: IEEE Joint 19th International Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Informatics and 7th International Conference on Recent Achievements in Mechatronics, Automation, Computer Sciences and RoboticsAt: Szeged, Hungary","Project: Automated Recognition of Antisocial Behavior in Online Communities"],"references":["333903270_A_Novel_Approach_Towards_Fake_News_Detection_Deep_Learning_Augmented_with_Textual_Entailment_Features","328694360_Deep_Learning_Algorithms_for_Detecting_Fake_News_in_Online_Text","321485003_Tracing_Fake-News_Footprints_Characterizing_Social_Media_Messages_by_How_They_Propagate","320300831_Detection_of_Online_Fake_News_Using_N-Gram_Analysis_and_Machine_Learning_Techniques","333060334_What_happened_The_Spread_of_Fake_News_Publisher_Content_During_the_2016_US_Presidential_Election","332952191_Supervised_Learning_for_Fake_News_Detection","332457421_Multi-Label_Fake_News_Detection_using_Multi-layered_Supervised_Learning","331913505_An_overview_of_online_fake_news_Characterization_detection_and_discussion","328525342_Weakly_Supervised_Learning_for_Fake_News_Detection_on_Twitter","322413683_Antisocial_Behavior_on_the_Web_Characterization_and_Detection"]}
