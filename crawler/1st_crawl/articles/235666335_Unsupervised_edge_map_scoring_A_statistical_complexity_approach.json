{"id":"235666335_Unsupervised_edge_map_scoring_A_statistical_complexity_approach","abstract":"Through the last decades, edge detection algorithms have obtained a great\ndegree of sophistication, not being the same with the tools that evaluate their\nperformance. The selection of the best possible edge map output for a given\nimage in an unsupervised way, without prior knowledge of the real edge\nstructure, is still an image processing open problem.\nIn this work we define a method to evaluate the performance of Edge detection\n(ED) techniques without any knowledge of the true edge structure, besides the\nED output. The method studies the quality of an edge map through a new\nstatistical complexity measure that searches for the balance between the edge\nequilibrium and the edge information estimated from the ED image. In the ED\ncontext, edge equilibrium refers to perfect shape made with very few edge\npoints, while edge information refers to image structure made with many edge\npoints. In order to measure edge equilibrium, a cosine based similarity index\nis made projecting the image into a family of edge patterns that score the\ncontinuity and width of edges in fixed size windows of the ED image. The\ninformation is measured by an edge map entropy function based on the Kolmogorov\nSmirnov test statistic. The statistical complexity measure is thus defined as\nthe product of the similarity index that measures equilibrium and the entropy\nthat measure information.\nOur experiments made over selected images of the South Florida and Berkeley\ndatabases show that the new statistical complexity measure is able to score\nmeaningfully different man made Ground Truths, and to select the best edge map\nfrom a large set of outputs of six different edge detectors, Canny, Sobel,\nPrewitt, Roberts, Laplacian of Gaussian, and Zerocross, compared with\nsupervised selections made with Pratt's Figure of merit (FOM) measure.","authors":["Javier Gimenez","Jorge Martines","Ana Flesia"],"meta":["February 2013Computer Vision and Image Understanding 122","DOI:10.1016/j.cviu.2014.02.005","SourcearXiv"],"references":["224377985_A_Computational_Approach_To_Edge_Detection","222122965_A_multivariate_Kolmogorov-Smirnov_test_of_goodness_of_fit","48872330_Edge_and_line_oriented_contour_detection_State_of_the_art","17083076_Theory_of_Edge_Detection","3813506_Edge_Detector_Evaluation_using_Empirical_ROC_Curves","3193578_A_method_for_objective_edge_detection_evaluation_and_detector_parameter_selection","342183905_A_Coefficient_of_Agreement_for_Nominal_Scales","313039749_SEQM_Edge_quality_assessment_based_on_structural_pixel_matching","292684057_An_objective_and_subjective_evaluation_of_edge_detection_methods_in_images","292102365_Digital_Image_Processing","267366818_A_New_Reference-Based_Measure_For_Objective_Edge_Map_Evaluation","261076150_SEQM_Edge_quality_assessment_based_on_structural_pixel_matching","244958444_A_Mathematical_Theory_of_Communication_The_Bell_System_Technical_Journal","235418978_A_Mathematical_Theory_of_Communication","235035277_Camera_Models_and_Machine_Perception","234450820_Evaluation_of_edge_operators_using_relative_and_absolute_grading","234022302_Quantitative_error_measures_for_edge_detection","234014465_Digital_Image_Processing","228445302_Nonparametric_Edge_Detection_in_Speckled_Imagery","224102754_Algorithm_for_Computer_Control_of_a_Digital_Plotter","223839491_Edge_Detector_Evaluation_Using_Empirical_ROC_Curves","222590010_Characterization_of_empirical_discrepancy_evaluation_measures","222528476_A_statistical_approach_to_multi-scale_edge_detection","222493105_A_Statistical_Measure_of_Complexity","220611791_Efficient_evaluations_of_edge_connectivity_and_width_uniformity","220610779_Automatic_generation_of_consensus_ground_truth_for_the_comparison_of_edge_detection_techniques","220017506_A_Coefficient_of_Agreement_For_Nominal_Scales","200132407_Object_enhancement_and_extraction","200132404_Digital_image_processing","200110749_A_Coefficient_of_Agreement_for_Nominal_Scales","51993442_A_Mathematical_Theory_of_Communication","8255820_Learning_to_Detect_Natural_Image_Boundaries_Using_Local_Brightness_Color_and_Texture_Cues","3906161_A_Database_of_Human_Segmented_Natural_Images_and_its_Application_to_Evaluating_Segmentation_Algorithms_and_Measuring_Ecological_Statistics","3192786_A_robust_visual_method_for_assessing_the_relative_performance_of_edge-detection_algorithms","3192781_Performance_Assessment_through_Bootstrap","3115226_Edge_Evaluation_Using_Local_Edge_Coherence","2995484_Quantitative_design_and_evaluation_enhancementthresholding_edge_detectors","2763813_An_Error_Metric_for_Binary_Images"]}
