{"id":"262361857_Relaxed_p-adic_Hensel_lifting_for_algebraic_systems","abstract":"In a previous article [1], an implementation of lazy p-adic integers with a multiplication of quasi-linear complexity, the so-called relaxed product, was presented. Given a ring R and an element p in R, we design a relaxed Hensel lifting for algebraic systems from R/ (p) to the p-adic completion Rp of R. Thus, any root of linear and algebraic regular systems can be lifted with a quasi-optimal complexity. We report our implementations in C++ within the computer algebra system Mathemagix and compare them with Newton operator. As an application, we solve linear systems over the integers and compare the running times with Linbox and IML.","authors":["Jérémy Berthomieu","Romain Lebreton"],"meta":["July 2012","DOI:10.1145/2442829.2442842","Conference: Proceedings of the 37th International Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic Computation"],"references":["233512878_Relax_but_Dont_be_Too_Lazy","222830657_New_algorithms_for_relaxed_multiplication","50949805_From_implicit_to_recursive_equations","44029767_Relaxed_algorithms_for_p-adic_numbers","40653243_Relaxed_resolution_of_implicit_equations","37443131_Algebraic_Complexity_Theory","2538881_Lazy_Multiplication_of_Formal_Power_Series","264945958_Modern_Computer_Algebra","252542916_La_Methode_des_Fluxions_et_des_Suites_Infinies","243503803_GNU_MP_The_GNU_Multiple_Precision_Arithmetic_Library","242575050_Polynomial_and_matrix_computations","225193916_Exact_solution_of_linear_equations_usingP-adic_expansions","225106398_Fast_online_multiplication_of_real_numbers","222447039_Generating_power_of_lazy_semantics","221591256_Fast_On-Line_Integer_Multiplication","221398565_Polynomially_Time_Computable_Functions_over_p-Adic_Fields","221149835_Approximate_algorithms_to_derive_exact_solutions_to_systems_of_linear_equations","220573269_Fast_On-Line_Integer_Multiplication","220160703_High-order_lifting_and_integrality_certification","49457599_Faster_Integer_Multiplication","30515978_Arithmetique_et_algorithmique_en_algebre_lineaire_exacte_pour_la_bibliotheque_LinBox","2505433_On_Fast_Multiplication_of_Polynomials_Over_Arbitrary_Algebras","2504733_Factorization_of_Differential_Operators_with_Rational_Functions_Coefficients","2451968_Formal_Solutions_and_Factorization_of_Differential_Operators_with_Power_Series_Coefficients"]}
