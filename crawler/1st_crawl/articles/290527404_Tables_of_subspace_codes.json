{"id":"290527404_Tables_of_subspace_codes","abstract":"The main problem of subspace coding asks for the maximum possible cardinality\nof a subspace code with minimum distance at least $d$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q^n$,\nwhere the dimensions of the codewords, which are vector spaces, are contained\nin $K\\subseteq\\{0,1,\\dots,n\\}$. In the special case of $K=\\{k\\}$ one speaks of\nconstant dimension codes. Since this emerging field is very prosperous on the\none hand side and there are a lot of connections to classical objects from\nGalois geometry it is a bit difficult to keep or to obtain an overview about\nthe current state of knowledge. To this end we have implemented an on-line\ndatabase of the (at least to us) known results at\n\\url{subspacecodes.uni-bayreuth.de}. The aim of this recurrently updated\ntechnical report is to provide a user guide how this technical tool can be used\nin research projects and to describe the so far implemented theoretic and\nalgorithmic knowledge.","authors":["Daniel Heinlein","Michael Kiermaier","Sascha Kurz","Alfred Wassermann"],"meta":["January 2016","SourcearXiv"],"references":["287250498_Improved_upper_bounds_for_partial_spreads","259692531_Construction_of_Large_Constant_Dimension_Codes_with_a_Prescribed_Minimum_Distance","258247350_Optimal_Binary_Subspace_Codes_of_Length_6_Constant_Dimension_3_and_Minimum_Distance_4","236936058_Problems_on_q-Analogs_in_Coding_Theory","235008632_Theory_of_codes_with_maximum_rank_distance_translation","313576952_Partial_t-spreads_and_group_constructible_s_r-nets","268017459_Finite_geometries_Repr_of_the_1968_ed","261952162_Subspace_Codes_Based_on_Graph_Matchings_Ferrers_Diagrams_and_Pending_Blocks","236236924_Network_Coding_Theory_A_Survey","227727062_Line_spreads_of_PG5_2","224324772_Error-Correcting_Codes_in_Projective_Space","220639345_The_maximum_size_of_a_partial_3-spread_in_a_finite_vector_space_over_GF2","227112973_Uber_nicht-Desarguessche_Ebenen_mit_transitiver_Translationsgruppe","226953499_Partial_t-spreads_and_group_constructible_-nets","226508106_Partial_spreads_in_finite_projective_spaces_and_partial_designs"]}
