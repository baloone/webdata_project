{"id":"266327117_Why_Lexical_Semantics_is_Important_for_E-Lexicography_and_Why_it_is_Equally_Important_to_Hide_its_Formal_Representations_from_Users_of_Dictionaries","abstract":"This paper reviews different ways in which lexical semantics models can be applied to e-lexicography with a focus on specialized\ndictionaries for learners. I show how components of these models can be implemented in the entries of digital dictionaries\nand how they help lexicographers systematize lexical relations between lexical units (in the same language or across different\nlanguages). This being said, users of dictionaries cannot be requested to familiarize themselves with different theoretical\nframeworks. I present various strategies to present the data contained in entries that exploit the potential of formal and\nsystematic descriptions while keeping the technical concepts and metalanguage associated with theoretical frameworks in the\nbackground. More specifically, I show how these models and strategies were implemented in two multilingual online specialized\ndictionaries, i.e. the DiCoInfo (Dictionnaire fondamental de l’informatique et de l’Internet) and the DiCoEnviro (Dictionnaire\nfondamental de l’environnement).","authors":["Marie-Claude L'Homme"],"meta":["October 2014International Journal of Lexicography","DOI:10.1093/ijl/ecu019"],"references":["290987024_Lexical_functions_in_lexicography_and_natural_language_processing","266735043_Le_DiCoInfo_Methodologie_pour_une_nouvelle_generation_de_dictionnaires_specialises","266140374_Designing_Terminological_Dictionaries_for_Learners_based_on_Lexical_Semantics_The_representation_of_actants","265597641_Adding_syntactico-semantic_information_to_specialized_dictionaries_an_application_of_the_FrameNet_methodology","265597503_Encoding_collocations_in_DiCoInfo_From_formal_to_user-friendly_representations","265251985_Dictionary_Users_in_the_Digital_Revolution","278393730_Large-scale_Lexicography_in_the_Digital_Age","273025389_WordNet_FrameNet_and_Other_Semantic_Networks_in_the_International_Journal_of_Lexicography_-_The_Net_Result","263806986_Dictionnaire_d'Apprentissage_du_Francais_des_Affaires","259745236_Specialised_Dictionaries_for_Learners"]}
