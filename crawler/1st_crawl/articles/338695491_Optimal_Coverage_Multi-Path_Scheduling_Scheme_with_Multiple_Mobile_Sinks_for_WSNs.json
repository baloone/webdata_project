{"id":"338695491_Optimal_Coverage_Multi-Path_Scheduling_Scheme_with_Multiple_Mobile_Sinks_for_WSNs","abstract":"Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are usually formed with many tiny sensors which are randomly deployed within sensing field for target monitoring. These sensors can transmit their monitored data to the sink in a multi-hop communication manner. However, the ‘hot spots’ problem will be caused since nodes near sink will consume more energy during forwarding. Recently, mobile sink based technology provides an alternative solution for the long-distance communication and sensor nodes only need to use single hop communication to the mobile sink during data transmission. Even though it is difficult to consider many network metrics such as sensor position, residual energy and coverage rate etc., it is still very important to schedule a reasonable moving trajectory for the mobile sink. In this paper, a novel trajectory scheduling method based on coverage rate for multiple mobile sinks (TSCR-M) is presented especially for large-scale WSNs. An improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) combined with mutation operator is introduced to search the parking positions with optimal coverage rate. Then the genetic algorithm (GA) is adopted to schedule the moving trajectory for multiple mobile sinks. Extensive simulations are performed to validate the performance of our proposed method.","authors":["Jin Wang","Yu Gao","Chang Zhou","Robert S Sherratt"],"meta":["January 2020Computers, Materials and Continua 61(3):695-711","DOI:10.32604/cmc.2020.08674"],"references":["345445207_An_Affinity_Propagation-Based_Self-Adaptive_Clustering_Method_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","334553567_Mobile_Multi-Sink_Nodes_Path_Planning_Algorithm_Concerned_With_Energy_Balance_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","333082318_An_empower_hamilton_loop_based_data_collection_algorithm_with_mobile_agent_for_WSNs","332477313_Travel_Route_Planning_with_Optimal_Coverage_in_Difficult_Wireless_Sensor_Network_Environment","332075071_Energy_Efficient_Routing_Algorithm_with_Mobile_Sink_Support_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","332052227_An_intelligent_data_gathering_schema_with_data_fusion_supported_for_mobile_sink_in_wireless_sensor_networks","330939697_An_Improved_Routing_Schema_with_Special_Clustering_Using_PSO_Algorithm_for_Heterogeneous_Wireless_Sensor_Network","344742606_An_Improved_Flower_Pollination_Algorithm_for_Optimizing_Layouts_of_Nodes_in_Wireless_Sensor_Network","332056654_Novel_Systolization_of_Subquadratic_Space_Complexity_Multipliers_Based_on_Toeplitz_Matrix-Vector_Product_Approach","331615657_An_Asynchronous_Clustering_and_Mobile_Data_Gathering_Schema_Based_on_Timer_Mechanism_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks"]}
