{"id":"303349470_Numerical_methods_for_computing_angles_between_linear_subspaces","abstract":"Assume that two subspaces F and G of a unitary space are defined as the ranges (or null spaces) of given rectangular matrices A and B. Accurate numerical methods are developed for computing the principal angles θk(F, G) and orthogonal sets of principal vectors uk ϵ Fand vk ϵ G, k = 1, 2, q = dim(G) ≤ dim(F). An important application in statistics is computing the canonical correlations σk = cos θk between two sets of variates. A perturbation analysis shows that the condition number for θk essentially is max(k(A), k(B)), where k denotes the condition number of a matrix. The algorithms are based on a preliminary QR-factorization of A and B (or AH and BH, for which either the method of Householder transformations (HT) or the modified Gram-Schmidt method (MGS) is used. Then cos θk and sin θk are computed as the singular values of certain related matrices. Experimental results are given, which indicates that MGS gives θk with equal precision and fewer arithmetic operations than HT. However, HT gives principal vectors, which are orthogonal to working accuracy, which is not generally true for MGS. Finally, the case when A and /or B are rank deficient is discussed.","authors":["Ake Bjorck","G.H.
