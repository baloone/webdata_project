{"id":"334639576_Multi-View_Multi-Label_Learning_With_View-Label-Specific_Features","abstract":"In multi-view multi-label learning, each object is represented by multiple data views, and belongs to multiple class labels simultaneously. Generally, all the data views have a contribution to the multi-label learning task, but their contributions are different. Besides, for each data view, each class label is only associated with a subset data features, and different features have different contributions to each class label. In this paper, we propose a novel framework VLSF for multi-view multi-label learning, i.e., multi-view multi-label learning with View-Label-Specific Features. Specifically, we first learn a low dimensional label-specific data representation for each data view and construct a multi-label classification model based on it by exploiting label correlations and view consensus, and learn the contribution weight of each data view to multi-label learning task for all the class labels jointly. Then, the final prediction can be made by combing the prediction results of all the classifiers and the learned contribution weights. Extensive comparison experiments with the state-of-the-art approaches manifest the effectiveness of the proposed method VLSF.","authors":["Jun Huang","Xiwen Qu","Guorong Li","Feng Qin"],"meta":["July 2019IEEE Access PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2930468"],"references":["319391426_An_ensemble_approach_to_multi-view_multi-instance_learning","335660837_Collaboration_Based_Multi-Label_Learning","332389623_Improving_Multi-Label_Classification_with_Missing_Labels_by_Learning_Label-Specific_Features","329807135_Towards_a_unified_multi-source-based_optimization_framework_for_multi-label_learning","328455457_Learning_Label-Specific_Features_for_Multi-Label_Classification_with_Missing_Labels","326182978_Multi-label_learning_with_label-specific_features_by_resolving_label_correlations","326092524_Multi-Label_Semi-Supervised_Classification_Through_Optimum-Path_Forest","324995418_Multi-view_Weak-label_Learning_based_on_Matrix_Completion","323974521_Joint_Multi-View_Representation_and_Image_Annotation_via_Optimal_Predictive_Subspace_Learning","322058832_Multi-Label_Classification_using_a_Fuzzy_Rough_Neighborhood_Consensus","317719312_Multi-Target_Support_Vector_Regression_Via_Correlation_Regressor_Chains","316443414_Multi-label_classification_with_meta-label-specific_features","314251895_Multi-view_Learning_Overview_Recent_Progress_and_New_Challenges","313904294_Group_sensitive_Classifier_Chains_for_multi-label_classification","313732929_Joint_Feature_Selection_and_Classification_for_Multilabel_Learning"]}
