{"id":"256464860_Edge-colouring_and_total-colouring_chordless_graphs","abstract":"A graph $G$ is \\emph{chordless} if no cycle in $G$ has a chord. In the\npresent work we investigate the chromatic index and total chromatic number of\nchordless graphs. We describe a known decomposition result for chordless graphs\nand use it to establish that every chordless graph of maximum degree\n$\\Delta\\geq 3$ has chromatic index $\\Delta$ and total chromatic number $\\Delta\n+ 1$. The proofs are algorithmic in the sense that we actually output an\noptimal colouring of a graph instance in polynomial time.","authors":["Raphael C. S.
