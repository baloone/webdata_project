{"id":"335873729_EVA_Generating_Emotional_Behavior_of_Virtual_Agents_using_Expressive_Features_of_Gait_and_Gaze","abstract":"We present a novel, real-time algorithm, EVA, for generating virtual agents with various perceived emotions. Our approach is based on using Expressive Features of gaze and gait to convey emotions corresponding to happy, sad, angry, or neutral. We precompute a data-driven mapping between gaits and their perceived emotions. EVA uses this gait emotion association at runtime to generate appropriate walking styles in terms of gaits and gaze. Using the EVA algorithm, we can simulate gaits and gazing behaviors of hundreds of virtual agents in real-time with known emotional characteristics. We have evaluated the benefits in different multi-agent VR simulation environments. Our studies suggest that the use of expressive features corresponding to gait and gaze can considerably increase the sense of presence in scenarios with multiple virtual agents.","authors":["Tanmay
