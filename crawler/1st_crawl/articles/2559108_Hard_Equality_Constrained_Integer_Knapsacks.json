{"id":"2559108_Hard_Equality_Constrained_Integer_Knapsacks","abstract":"We consider the following integer feasibility problem: “Given positive integer numbers a\n0, a\n1,..., a\nn, with gcd(a\n1,..., a\nn) = 1 and a = (a\n1,..., a\nn), does there exist a nonnegative integer vector x satisfying ax = a\n0?” Some instances of this type have been found to be extremely hard to solve by standard methods such as branch-and-bound, even if the number of variables is as small as ten. We observe that not only the sizes of the numbers a\n0, a\n1,..., a\nn, but also their structure, have a large impact on the difficulty of the instances. Moreover, we demonstrate that the characteristics that make the instances so difficult to solve by branch-and-bound make the solution of a certain reformulation of the problem almost trivial. We accompany our results by a small computational study.","authors":["Karen Aardal","Arjen K.
