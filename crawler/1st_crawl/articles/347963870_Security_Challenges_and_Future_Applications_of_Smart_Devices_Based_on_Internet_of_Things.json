{"id":"347963870_Security_Challenges_and_Future_Applications_of_Smart_Devices_Based_on_Internet_of_Things","abstract":"With the Internet of Things (IoT) step by step developing as the ensuing period of the advancement of the Internet, it gets critical to perceive the different expected areas for the use of IoT and the research challenges that are related with these applicationsâ€” going from brilliant smart cities, to health care services, smart agriculture, coordinations and retail. IoT is required to invade into for all intents and purposes for all parts of the day by day life. Even though the current IoT empowering technologies have enormously improved in the ongoing years, there are as yet various issues that require consideration. Since the IoT idea results from heterogeneous technologies, many research challenges will undoubtedly emerge. The way that IoT is so sweeping and influences all parts of our lives makes it a considerable research theme for concentrates in different related fields, for example, data technology and computer science. Accordingly, IoT is preparing for new elements of research to be completed. This paper presents the ongoing advancement of IoT technologies and examines future applications and research challenges.","authors":["Ankit Narendrakumar Soni"],"meta":["March 2020SSRN Electronic Journal 3(3):10 - 15","DOI:10.2139/ssrn.3761340"],"references":["343262693_IOT_connected_with_e-learning","331607486_Internet_of_Things_Infrastructure_Architecture_Security_and_Privacy","320995342_Interoperability_in_IoT_Through_the_Semantic_Profiling_of_Objects","301234345_Medicine_Reminder_and_Monitoring_System_for_Secure_Health_Using_IOT","26845114_Challenges_for_Database_Management_in_the_Internet_of_Things","346508370_Analysis_of_different_convolution_neural_network_models_to_diagnose_Alzheimer's_disease","344617629_Design_implementation_of_real_time_autonomous_car_by_using_image_processing_IoT"]}
