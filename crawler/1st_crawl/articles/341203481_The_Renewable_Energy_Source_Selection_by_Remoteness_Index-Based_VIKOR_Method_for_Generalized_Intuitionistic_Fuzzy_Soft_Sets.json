{"id":"341203481_The_Renewable_Energy_Source_Selection_by_Remoteness_Index-Based_VIKOR_Method_for_Generalized_Intuitionistic_Fuzzy_Soft_Sets","abstract":"In this paper, we introduce the Euclidean, Hamming, and generalized distance measures for the\n2 generalized intuitionistic fuzzy soft sets (GIFSSs). We discuss the properties of the presented distance measures.\n3 The numerical example of decision making and pattern recognition is discussed based on the proposed distance\n4 measures. We develop a remoteness index-based VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje\n5 (VIKOR) method for GIFSSs. The displaced and fixed ideals intuitionistic fuzzy values (IFVs) are defined. The\n6 novel concept of displaced and fixed remoteness indexes for IFVs are discussed. We discuss the methods to\n7 obtain the precise and intuitionistic fuzzy (IF) weights. The several displaced and fixed ranking indexes are\ndefined based on the precise and IF weights. The remoteness indexes based VIKOR methods are proposed in\nthe form of four algorithms. In the end, the selection of renewable energy sources problem is solved by using\nthe four remoteness index-based VIKOR methods.","authors":["Phatiphat Thounthong","Muhammad JABIR Khan","Poom Kumam","Nasser Aedh Alreshidi"],"meta":["May 2020Symmetry","DOI:10.3390/sym12060977","Project: Optimization and operational research"],"references":["340137243_Distance_and_Similarity_Measures_for_Spherical_Fuzzy_Sets_and_Their_Applications_in_Selecting_Mega_Projects","338885728_APPLICATIONS_OF_GENERALIZED_PICTURE_FUZZY_SOFT_SET_IN_CONCEPT_SELECTION","338208938_Another_view_on_generalized_interval_valued_intuitionistic_fuzzy_soft_set_and_its_applications_in_decision_support_system","337541929_VIKOR_method_for_multiple_criteria_group_decision_making_under_2-tuple_linguistic_neutrosophic_environment","337481382_An_adjustable_weighted_soft_discernibility_matrix_based_on_generalized_picture_fuzzy_soft_set_and_its_applications_in_decision_making","335147329_A_Novel_Approach_to_Generalized_Intuitionistic_Fuzzy_Soft_Sets_and_Its_Application_in_Decision_Support_System","332178442_An_Extended_Picture_Fuzzy_VIKOR_Approach_for_Sustainable_Supplier_Management_and_Its_Application_in_the_Beef_Industry","345700834_Remoteness_index-based_Pythagorean_fuzzy_VIKOR_methods_with_a_generalized_distance_measure_for_multiple_criteria_decision_analysis","338661988_q-Rung_orthopair_fuzzy_soft_average_aggregation_operators_and_their_application_in_multicriteria_decision-making","337964498_An_Extended_VIKOR_Method_for_Multiple_Attribute_Decision_Making_with_Linguistic_D_Numbers_Based_on_Fuzzy_Entropy"]}
