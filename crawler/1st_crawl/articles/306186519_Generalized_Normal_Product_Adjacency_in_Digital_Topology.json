{"id":"306186519_Generalized_Normal_Product_Adjacency_in_Digital_Topology","abstract":"We study properties of Cartesian products of digital images for which\nadjacencies based on the normal product adjacency are used. We show\nthat the use of such adjacencies lets us obtain many \"product properties\"\nfor which the analogous statement is either unknown or invalid if, instead,\nwe were to use c_u-adjacencies.","authors":["Laurence Boxer"],"meta":["October 2017Applied General Topology 18(2):401-427","DOI:10.4995/agt.2017.7798"],"references":["291014248_Connectivity_Preserving_Multivalued_Functions_in_Digital_Topology","282181998_Homotopy_relations_for_digital_images","279968212_Digital_Fixed_Points_Approximate_Fixed_Points_and_Universal_Functions","279068928_A_Borsuk-Ulam_theorem_for_digital_images","273472173_Remarks_on_pointed_digital_homotopy","324461217_Digital_Topology","302558561_Graphs_and_Hypergraphs","289824355_A_New_Concept_for_Digital_Geometry","288521955_An_extended_digital_k0_k1-continuity","273517172_On_the_Composition_of_Digitally_Continuous_Multivalued_Functions"]}
