{"id":"322457145_Model-Free_Prediction_of_Large_Spatiotemporally_Chaotic_Systems_from_Data_A_Reservoir_Computing_Approach","abstract":"We demonstrate the effectiveness of using machine learning for model-free prediction of spatiotemporally chaotic systems of arbitrarily large spatial extent and attractor dimension purely from observations of the systemâ€™s past evolution. We present a parallel scheme with an example implementation based on the reservoir computing paradigm and demonstrate the scalability of our scheme using the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation as an example of a spatiotemporally chaotic system.","authors":["Jaideep Pathak","Brian Hunt","Michelle Girvan","Zhixin Lu"],"meta":["January 2018Physical Review Letters 120(2)","DOI:10.1103/PhysRevLett.120.024102"],"references":["319403947_Reservoir_Computing_Beyond_Memory-Nonlinearity_Trade-off","313463701_High-Speed_Photonic_Reservoir_Computing_Using_a_Time-Delay-Based_Architecture_Million_Words_per_Second_Classification","292074166_Mastering_the_game_of_Go_with_deep_neural_networks_and_tree_search","277411157_Deep_Learning","267982748_Reservoir_computing_with_a_single_time-delay_autonomous_Boolean_node","318010085_The_difference_between_memory_and_prediction_in_linear_recurrent_networks","315793836_Reservoir_observers_Model-free_inference_of_unmeasured_variables_in_chaotic_systems","301852717_Chaotic_behavior_of_multidimensional_difference_equations_in_Functional_Differential_Equations_and_Approximation_of_Fixed_Points","286784019_Ill-posed_problems","267480780_Linear_Regression_Analysis_Theory_and_Computing"]}
