{"id":"221607792_Heroes_Villains_Magicians_Dramatis_Personae_in_a_Virtual_Story_Creation_Environment","abstract":"One difficulty in creating synthetic characters for interactive stories is that these characters must convey their role in the story in a believable way. However, the relation between believability, on one side, and the role a character plays in a drama, on the other, has not yet been fully addressed. In this paper we will present a view on how to develop believable synthetic characters whose behaviour is based on a set of predefined functions (Propp's functions) associated with the role they play in the story. To illustrate the approach, we will present a collaborative virtual environment, Teatrix, designed for children to build their own stories-fairy tales. In Teatrix, virtual actors play roles (such as villain, hero, magician, etc), which are functional for the development of the story. Such roles have pre-defined goals and plans, allowing the story to flow and climax situations to arise. Teatrixis already in use by children ages between 7 and 9, in the context of a Computer-Integrated Classroom scenario.","authors":["Ana Paiva","Isabel Machado Alexandre","Rui Prada"],"meta":["January 2001","DOI:10.1145/359784.360314","SourceDBLP","Conference: Proceedings of the 6th international conference on Intelligent user interfaces"],"references":["243532878_Heroes_Villains_Magicians_Believable_Characters_in_a_Story_Creation_Environment","225115292_Multi-level_control_for_animated_autonomous_agents_Do_the_right_thing_Oh_not_that","262368673_Bringing_drama_into_a_virtual_stage","248056012_The_Uses_of_Enchantment_Penguin_Books","242421753_Disney_Animation_The_Illusion_Of_Life","242398189_The_House_of_Make-believe","234782889_Perceptual_user_interfaces_perceptual_intelligence","229060074_Morphology_of_the_Folk_Tale","225929175_Making_Space_for_Voice_Technologies_to_Support_Children's_Fantasy_and_Storytelling","225543438_Perceptual_Intelligence","221607995_Guiding_the_User_Through_Dynamically_Generated_Hypermedia_Presentations_with_a_Life-like_Character","224927647_Computers_as_Theatre","221518870_The_Persona_Effect_Affective_Impact_of_Animated_Pedagogical_Agents","220425645_Perceptual_Intelligence","200773397_Explanatory_Lifelike_Evatars_Performing_User-Centered_Tasks_in_3D_Learning_Environments"]}
