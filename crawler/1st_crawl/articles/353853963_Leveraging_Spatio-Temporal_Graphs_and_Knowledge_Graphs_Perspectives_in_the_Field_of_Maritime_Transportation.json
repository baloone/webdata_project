{"id":"353853963_Leveraging_Spatio-Temporal_Graphs_and_Knowledge_Graphs_Perspectives_in_the_Field_of_Maritime_Transportation","abstract":"This paper introduces a prospective study of the potential of spatio-temporal graphs (ST-graphs) and knowledge graphs (K-graphs) for the modelling of geographical phenomena. While the integration of time within GIS has long been a domain of major interest, alternative modelling and data manipulation approaches derived from graph and knowledge-based principles provide many opportunities for many application domains. We first survey graph principles and how they have been applied to GIS and a few representative domains to date. A comprehensive analysis of the principles behind K-graphs, respective data representation and manipulation capabilities is discussed. The perspectives offered by a close integration of ST-graphs and K-graphs are explored. The whole approach is illustrated and discussed in the context of maritime transportation.","authors":["GÃ©raldine Del Mondo","Peng Peng","Jerome Gensel","Christophe Claramunt"],"meta":["August 2021International Journal of Geo-Information 10(8):541","DOI:10.3390/ijgi10080541"],"references":["351115157_A_Survey_on_Knowledge_Graphs_Representation_Acquisition_and_Applications","342517691_Ontologies_for_geospatial_information_Progress_and_challenges_ahead","342096983_CoRiMaS-An_Ontological_Approach_to_Cooperative_Risk_Management_in_Seaports","341660165_Building_Linked_Spatio-Temporal_Data_from_Vectorized_Historical_Maps","340278357_Geographies_of_maritime_transport","346198585_Mapping_the_global_liquefied_natural_gas_trade_network_A_perspective_of_maritime_transportation","343100403_An_interpretable_attraction_recommendation_method_based_on_knowledge_graph","342311389_Mapping_the_Port_Influence_Diffusion_Patterns_A_Case_Study_of_Rotterdam_Antwerp_and_Singapore","341665023_Network_effects_govern_the_evolution_of_maritime_trade","338943166_Knowledge_Graphs_Methodology_Tools_and_Selected_Use_Cases","338723656_Conciliating_Perspectives_from_Mapping_Agencies_and_Web_of_Data_on_Successful_European_SDIs_Toward_a_European_Geographic_Knowledge_Graph","337621557_Big_Spatiotemporal_Data_Anlyatics_A_Research_and_Innovation_Frontier","336083309_Massive_Automatic_Identification_System_Sensor_Trajectory_Data-Based_Multi-Layer_Linkage_Network_Dynamics_of_Maritime_Transport_along_21st-Century_Maritime_Silk_Road","335855259_Detecting_geo-relation_phrases_from_web_texts_for_triplet_extraction_of_geographic_knowledge_a_context-enhanced_method","338181610_Characterizing_the_global_liquefied_petroleum_gas_trading_community_using_mass_vessel_trajectory_data"]}
