{"id":"289237279_Observer_design_and_feedback_controller_synthesis_with_observer_in_idempotent_semiring","abstract":"In this paper, we present an observer design and a feedback controller with observer for a discrete event system involving synchronization phenomena. These systems can be described by linear models in the idempotent semiring. The approach follows the same principle as the Luenberger observer used in continuous systems. Theoretical results are applied to an industrial process and simulation results are reported to show the effectiveness of these methods in the estimation for min max plus linear systems using Scilab.","authors":["A.N.
