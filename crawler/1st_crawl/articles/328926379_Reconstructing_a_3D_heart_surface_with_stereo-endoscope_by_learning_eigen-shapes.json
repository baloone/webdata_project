{"id":"328926379_Reconstructing_a_3D_heart_surface_with_stereo-endoscope_by_learning_eigen-shapes","abstract":"An efficient approach to dynamically reconstruct region of interest (ROI) on a beating heart from stereo-endoscopic video is developed. A ROI is first pre-reconstructed with a decoupled high-rank thin plate spline model. Eigen-shapes are learned from the pre-reconstructed data by using principal component analysis (PCA) to build a low-rank statistical deformable model for reconstructing subsequent frames. The linear transferability of PCA is proved, which allows fast eigen-shape learning. A general dynamic reconstruction framework is developed that formulates ROI reconstruction as an optimization problem of model parameters, and an efficient second-order minimization algorithm is derived to iteratively solve it. The performance of the proposed method is finally validated on stereo-endoscopic videos recorded by da Vinci robots.","authors":["Bo Yang","Chao Liu","Wenfeng Zheng","Shan Liu"],"meta":["November 2018Biomedical Optics Express 9(12):6222-6236","DOI:10.1364/BOE.9.006222","Project: Research on stereo vision-based 3D motion tracking of dynamic in vivo soft-tissue surface"],"references":["322602560_Sliding_to_predict_vision-based_beating_heart_motion_estimation_by_modeling_temporal_interactions","315965278_A_triangular_radial_cubic_spline_deformation_model_for_efficient_3D_beating_heart_tracking","308129582_Motion_Prediction_via_Online_Instantaneous_Frequency_Estimation_for_Vision-based_Beating_Heart_Tracking","283638950_An_Algorithm_for_the_Segmentation_of_Highly_Abnormal_Hearts_Using_a_Generic_Statistical_Shape_Model","320730698_Virtual_Reality_Surgery_Simulation_A_Survey_on_Patient_Specific_Solution","318869111_Fast_and_Fully_Automatic_Left_Ventricular_Segmentation_and_Tracking_in_Echocardiography_Using_Shape-Based_B-Spline_Explicit_Active_Surfaces","314459888_3D_reconstruction_of_cystoscopy_videos_for_comprehensive_bladder_records","310823358_Registration_of_free-hand_OCT_daughter_endoscopy_to_3D_organ_reconstruction","294423383_Automatic_Localization_of_Endoscope_in_Intraoperative_CT_Image_A_Simple_Approach_to_Augmented_Reality_Guidance_in_Laparoscopic_Surgery","294277345_Automatic_Segmentation_of_Wrist_Bones_in_CT_Using_a_Statistical_Wrist_ShapePose_Model"]}
