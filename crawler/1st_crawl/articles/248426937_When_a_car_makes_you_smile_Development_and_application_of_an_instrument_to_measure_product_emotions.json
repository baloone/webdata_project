{"id":"248426937_When_a_car_makes_you_smile_Development_and_application_of_an_instrument_to_measure_product_emotions","abstract":"This paper introduces the Product Emotion Measure (PrEmo), an instrument to assess emotions elicited by product appearance. The non-verbal self-report instrument is based on a set of 18 product emotions. These 18 emotions are visualised by animations of a cartoon character and presented on a computer interface. Subjects can express themselves by selecting those animations that correspond with their felt emotion. The paper discusses the development of PrEmo in the context of existing instruments. Furthermore, an illustrative study is reported, in which emotions elicited by car models are measured.","authors":["Pieter Desmet","Paul Hekkert","J.
