{"id":"318392715_Computing_the_number_of_realizations_of_a_Laman_graph","abstract":"Laman graphs model planar frameworks which are rigid for a general choice of distances between the vertices. There are finitely many ways, up to isometries, to realize a Laman graph in the plane. In a recent paper we provide a recursion formula for this number of realizations using ideas from algebraic and tropical geometry. Here, we present a concise summary of this result focusing on the main ideas and the combinatorial point of view.","authors":["Jose Capco","Matteo Gallet","Georg Grasegger","Christoph Koutschan"],"meta":["July 2017Electronic Notes in Discrete Mathematics 61","DOI:10.1016/j.endm.2017.06.040"],"references":["222112814_The_number_of_equivalent_realisations_of_a_rigid_graph","2853944_The_Number_of_Embeddings_of_Minimally_Rigid_Graphs","312550604_The_Number_of_Realizations_of_a_Laman_Graph","254887742_Mixed_Volume_and_Distance_Geometry_Techniques_for_Counting_Euclidean_Embeddings_of_Rigid_Graphs","222511832_Mixed_Volume_Techniques_for_Embeddings_of_Laman_Graphs","210232119_On_graphs_and_of_plane_skeletal_structures","210231991_Combinatorial_Rigidity"]}
