{"id":"260511020_Dead-Beat_Functional_Observers_for_Discrete-Time_LPV_Systems_With_Unknown_Inputs","abstract":"This technical note deals with functional observers for discrete-time linear parameter varying (LPV) systems. More specifically, dead-beat observers for reconstructing linear combinations of the state are proposed. The system inputs are assumed to be unknown and the observers reduce to functions of the output over a finite number of time-steps. The existence of such observers is proven by resorting to the notion of inverse system together with the concepts of maximal robust invariant subspaces and nilpotent semigroups. A constructive approach to derive the explicit equations of the observer is provided. An example illustrates the efficiency and the computational aspects of the method.","authors":["Mirko Fiacchini","Gilles Millerioux"],"meta":["December 2013IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control 58(12):3230-3235","DOI:10.1109/TAC.2013.2261712"],"references":["251951766_Finite_time_functional_observers_for_discrete-time_singular_systems_with_unknown_inputs","237575307_Une_approche_intrinseque_des_observateurs_lineaires_a_entrees_inconnues","288531314_Local_feedback_unknown_input_observer_for_nonlinear_systems","288044279_Linear_Parameter-Varying_Systems_an_approach_to_gain_scheduling","268617398_Functional_Observers_for_Dynamical_Systems","260082643_Set-Theoretic_Methods_in_Control","257012485_Nilpotent_semigroups_for_the_characterization_of_flat_outputs_of_switched_linear_and_LPV_discrete-time_systems","251755927_A_constructive_approach_to_algebraic_observability","242987295_An_algorithmic_approach_to_simultaneous_triangularization","241158157_Sliding_Mode_Functional_Observers_for_Nonlinear_Systems","227241475_Controlled_and_Conditioned_Invariant_Subspaces_in_Linear_System_Theory","224700031_Designing_Stable_Inverters_and_State_Observers_for_Switched_Linear_Systems_with_Unknown_Inputs","233161142_Exact_almost_and_optimal_input_decoupled_delayed_observers","230887934_Linear_System_Theory_and_Design","224660845_Nonlinear_observability_identifiability_and_persistent_trajectories"]}
