{"id":"329083010_GPU_Computations_and_Memory_Access_Model_Based_on_Petri_Nets","abstract":"In modern systems CPUs as well as GPUs are equipped with multi-level memory architectures, where different levels of the hierarchy vary in latency and capacity. Therefore, various memory access models were studied. Such a model can be seen as an interface abstracting the user from the physical architecture details. In this paper we present a general and uniform GPU computation and memory access model based on bounded inhibitor Petri nets (PNs). Its effectiveness is demonstrated by comparing its throughputs to practical computational experiments performed with the usage of Nvidia GPU with CUDA architecture.","authors":["Anna Gogolinska","Łukasz Mikulski","Marcin Piątkowski"],"meta":["January 2018","DOI:10.1007/978-3-662-58381-4_7","In book: Transactions on Petri Nets and Other Models of Concurrency XIII (pp.136-157)"],"references":["317219197_CPNtools_A_post-WIMP_interface_for_editing_and_simulating_coloured_petri_nets","262689408_Performance_Modeling_for_Highly-threaded_Many-core_GPUs","256555341_Structure_of_Concurrency","255702184_A_Memory_Access_Model_for_Highly-threaded_Many-core_Architectures","220951290_Designing_efficient_sorting_algorithms_for_manycore_GPUs","220728237_A_performance_prediction_model_for_the_CUDA_GPGPU_platform","220423225_Roofline_An_Insightful_Visual_Performance_Model_for_Multicore_Architectures","200039347_Computer_Architecture_-_A_Quantitative_Approach","303773483_Using_colored_petri_nets_for_GPGPU_performance_modeling","261357044_A_Simplified_and_Accurate_Model_of_Power-Performance_Efficiency_on_Emergent_GPU_Architectures","242501962_Advanced_computer_architecture_parallelism","236944300_Introduction_to_Parallel_Computing_2nd_Edition","228581729_Memory-level_and_Thread-level_Parallelism_Aware_GPU_Architecture_Performance_Analytical_Model","225382772_CPN_Tools_for_Editing_Simulating_and_Analysing_Coloured_Petri_Nets","220771200_An_analytical_model_for_a_GPU_architecture_with_memory-level_and_thread-level_parallelism_awareness","220695375_Advanced_Computer_Architecture_Parallelism_Scalability_Programmability","220690970_Coloured_Petri_Nets_Modelling_and_Validation_of_Concurrent_Systems","36027333_Information_sorting_in_the_application_of_electronic_digital_computers_to_business_operations","2984167_Analysis_and_Applications_Proceedings_of_the_IEEE_774_541-580"]}
