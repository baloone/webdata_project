{"id":"333164749_Rule-Generation_Theorem_and_its_Applications","abstract":"In several applications of sequent calculi going beyond pure logic, an introduction of suitably defined rules seems to be more profitable than addition of extra axiomatic sequents. A program of formalization of mathematical theories via rules of special sort was developed successfully by Negri and von Plato. In this paper a general theorem on possible ways of transforming axiomatic sequents into rules in sequent calculi is proved. We discuss its possible applications and provide some case studies for illustration.","authors":["Andrzej Indrzejczak"],"meta":["May 2019Bulletin of the Section of Logic 47(4):265-281","DOI:10.18778/0138-0680.47.4.03"],"references":["317126730_Simple_Decision_Procedure_for_S5_in_Standard_Cut-Free_Sequent_Calculus","266990431_Axioms_vs_Hypersequent_Rules_with_Context_Restrictions_Theory_and_Applications","325970476_Fregean_Description_Theory_in_Proof-Theoretical_Setting","313558469_Gentzen_method_in_modal_calculi_II","309303188_Hypersequent_rules_with_restricted_contexts_for_propositional_modal_logics","301238076_Simple_cut_elimination_proof_for_hybrid_logic","290706642_Hypersequent_Calculi_for_Modal_Logics_Extending_S4","281162586_An_introduction_to_proof_theory","268311537_Displaying_Modal_Logic","267130589_Gentzen_Calculi_for_Modal_Propositional_Logic"]}
