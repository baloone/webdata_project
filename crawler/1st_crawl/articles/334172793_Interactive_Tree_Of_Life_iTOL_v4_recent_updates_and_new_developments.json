{"id":"334172793_Interactive_Tree_Of_Life_iTOL_v4_recent_updates_and_new_developments","abstract":"The Interactive Tree Of Life (https://itol.embl.de) is an online tool for the display, manipulation and annotation of phylogenetic and other trees. It is freely available and open to everyone. The current version introduces four new dataset types, together with numerous new features. Annotation options have been expanded and new control options added for many display elements. An interactive spreadsheet-like editor has been implemented, providing dataset creation and editing directly in the web interface. Font support has been rewritten with full support for UTF-8 character encoding throughout the user interface. Google Web Fonts are now fully supported in the tree text labels. iTOL v4 is the first tool which supports direct visualization of Qiime 2 trees and associated annotations. The user account system has been streamlined and expanded with new navigation options, and currently handles >700 000 trees from more than 40 000 individual users. Full batch access has been implemented allowing programmatic upload and export of trees and annotations.","authors":["Ivica Letunic","Peer Bork"],"meta":["July 2019Nucleic Acids Research 47(W1):W256-W259","DOI:10.1093/nar/gkz239"],"references":["340768523_MEGA7_Molecular_Evolutionary_Genetics_Analysis_Version_70_for_Bigger_Datasets","320227386_How_and_Why_to_Build_a_Unified_Tree_of_Life","301851979_pplacer_linear_time_maximum-likelihood_and_Bayesian_phylogenetic_placement_of_sequences_onto_a_fixed_reference_tree","301761497_Evolview_v2_an_online_visualization_and_management_tool_for_customized_and_annotated_phylogenetic_trees","301539587_Interactive_Tree_of_Life_ITOL_v3_An_online_tool_for_the_display_and_annotation_of_phylogenetic_and_other_trees","296193199_ETE_3_Reconstruction_Analysis_and_Visualization_of_Phylogenomic_Data","267873927_IQ-TREE_A_Fast_and_Effective_Stochastic_Algorithm_for_Estimating_Maximum-Likelihood_Phylogenies","221854363_MrBayes_32_Efficient_Bayesian_Phylogenetic_Inference_and_Model_Choice_Across_a_Large_Model_Space","311480093_Analysis_of_16S_rRNA_Gene_Amplicon_Sequences_Using_the_QIIME_Software_Package","229063697_Dendroscope_3_An_Interactive_Tool_for_Rooted_Phylogenetic_Trees_and_Networks"]}
