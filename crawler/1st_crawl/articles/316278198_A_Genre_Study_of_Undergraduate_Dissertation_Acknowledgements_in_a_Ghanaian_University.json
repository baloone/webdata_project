{"id":"316278198_A_Genre_Study_of_Undergraduate_Dissertation_Acknowledgements_in_a_Ghanaian_University","abstract":"In recent times, scholars and researchers in Applied Linguistics have increasingly shown interest in dissertation acknowledgements/thesis acknowledgements (DAs/TAs) in various settings (Anglo-American, Arabic, and Asian), leaving those from Sub-Saharan Africa under-researched. The present study seeks to examine the DAs of undergraduate students at a Ghanaian university, following Hyland (2003, 2004). A data set of 200 DAs was obtained from two departments, English and Entomology & Wild Life. The qualitative research design was used as the main approach, supplemented by some descriptive statistics, to analyze the schematic structure and lexico-grammatical choices in the data set. Two key findings were observed in the study. First, the analysis showed a three-move pattern across the two sets of data and a slight differentiation in terms of text length across the exemplars. Secondly, the DAs from both departments deployed gratitude-related terms and socio-culturally conditioned names, while hybridized forms (realized in sociolinguistic terms as code-mixing) were preferably used in the DAs from the Department of English. These findings have implications for research on DAs/TAs, genre studies, and undergraduate research writing pedagogy.","authors":["Joseph Benjamin Archibald Afful"],"meta":["December 2016","DOI:10.18485/esptoday.2016.4.2.4"],"references":["322665831_A_pragmatic_analysis_of_MA_thesis_acknowledgements","321082481_THE_DIFFERENCES_BETWEEN_MALAY_AND_CHINESE_POST-GRADUATES'_GRATITUDE_THE_GENERIC_STRUCTURE_OF_DISSERTATION_ACKNOWLEDGEMENT","314467428_An_Analysis_of_Generic_Features_of_Acknowledgments_in_Academic_Writing_Native_Speakers_of_English_vs_Non-Native_Iranian","303880756_The_Generic_Structure_of_Acknowledgments_in_Persian_Dissertations","287820309_On_Acknowledgements_in_Ethnographies","278686305_13_Al-Ali_M_N_2009_Academic_and_socio-cultural_identities_in_English_dissertation_acknowledgements_of_Arab_writers_ESP_Across_Cultures_6_7-_27","273513340_Generic_patterns_and_socio-cultural_resources_in_acknowledgements_accompanying_Arabic_PhD_dissertations","273145978_Comparison_of_Gratitude_across_Context_Variations_A_Generic_Analysis_of_Dissertation_Acknowledgements_Written_by_Taiwanese_Authors_in_EFL_and_ESL_Contexts","273145974_A_genre_analysis_of_PhD_dissertation_acknowledgements_across_disciplinary_variations","267548777_Let's_pay_our_debt_and_exchange_gifts_a_study_of_sub-authorship_collaboration_in_medical_research","266223541_A_Contrastive_Study_of_Master_Thesis_Acknowledgements_by_Taiwanese_and_North_American_Students","256706486_The_Construction_of_Multiple_Identities_in_the_Acknowledgement_Section_of_a_Masters_Dissertation","256706392_Sub-disciplinary_Variation_and_Rhetoric_in_Dissertation_Acknowledgements_Written_by_Education_Students_The_Case_of_the_University_of_Cape_Coast_Ghana","248451918_Impoliteness_national_and_professional_identities_and_context_Some_evidence_from_e-mailed_'Call_for_Papers'","222081171_On_RA_abstracts_From_rhetorical_structure_to_thematic_organisation","344719748_Aspects_of_Article_Introductions_Michigan_Classics_Ed","334800228_Hidden_influencers_and_the_scholarly_enterprise_A_cross-culturallinguistic_study_of_acknowledgments_in_medical_research_articles","296823945_Interpreting_Academic_Acknowledgements_in_English_Studies_Professors_Their_Partners_and_Peers","292807522_Evidence_of_Generic_Tension_in_Academic_Book_Acknowledgements","279698287_Collaboration_in_the_Professional_Growth_of_American_Sociology","249738475_Dissertation_Acknowledgements_The_Anatomy_of_a_Cinderella_Genre","249238034_Worlds_of_Gratitude_A_Contrastive_Study_of_Acknowledgement_Texts_in_English_and_Italian_Research_Articles","249237777_Towards_a_Validated_Analysis_of_Scientific_Text_Structure","247994098_The_scholar's_courtesy_The_role_of_acknowledgement_in_the_primary_communication_process","245155235_Academic_tribes_and_territories_Intellectual_enquiry_and_the_culture_of_disciplines","241899967_How_Scholars_Credit_Editors_in_Their_Acknowledgements","238750475_Analysing_genre_Language_use_in_professional_settings","238677495_Nativization_of_Dissertation_Acknowledgements_and_Private_Letters_in_Cameroon1","235342143_Genre_analysis_English_in_academic_and_research_Settings","233065385_Address_Terms_among_University_Students_in_Ghana_A_Case_Study","229743151_I_would_like_to_thank_my_supervisor_Acknowledgments_in_graduate_dissertations","226415492_Funded_research_multiple_authorship_and_subauthorship_collaboration_in_four_disciplines","223112479_An_Exploratory_Analysis_of_History_Students'_Dissertation_Acknowledgments","222650448_Graduates'_gratitude_The_generic_structure_of_dissertation_acknowledgements","222181934_The_role_of_writing_in_graduate_engineering_education_A_survey_of_faculty_beliefs_and_practices","31377963_Genre_Analysis_and_the_Identification_of_Textual_Boundaries","24104135_Intellectual_Collaboration"]}
