{"id":"3898421_Accurate_iris_segmentation_based_on_novel_reflection_and_eyelash_detection_model","abstract":"The authors propose a novel noise detection model for accurate\nsegmentation of an iris. Eyelash, eyelid and reflection are three main\nnoises. Eyelid has already been solved by a traditional eye model;\nhowever, eyelash and reflection have not been tackled. To determinate a\npixel in an eyelash, the model presented follows the three criteria: 1)\nseparable eyelash condition; 2) non-informative condition; and 3)\nconnective criterion. The first and second conditions handle separable\nand multiple eyelashes respectively. The last criterion avoids\nmisclassification of strong iris texture as a single and separable\neyelash. For reflection, strong reflection points are detected by a\nthreshold and the weak reflection points around the strong points are\ndetermined by connective criterion and statistical test. A number of\nimages are selected to evaluate the accuracy and necessity of our noise\ndetection model and the results are encouraging","authors":["W.K.
