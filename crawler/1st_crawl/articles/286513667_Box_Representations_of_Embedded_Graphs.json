{"id":"286513667_Box_Representations_of_Embedded_Graphs","abstract":"A $d$-box is the cartesian product of $d$ intervals of $\\mathbb{R}$ and a\n$d$-box representation of a graph $G$ is a representation of $G$ as the\nintersection graph of a set of $d$-boxes in $\\mathbb{R}^d$. It was proved by\nThomassen in 1986 that every planar graph has a 3-box representation. In this\npaper we prove that every graph embedded in a fixed orientable surface, without\nshort non-contractible cycles, has a 5-box representation. This directly\nimplies that there is a function $f$, such that in every graph of genus $g$, a\nset of at most $f(g)$ vertices can be removed so that the resulting graph has a\n5-box representation. We show that such a function $f$ can be made linear in\n$g$. Finally, we prove that for any proper minor-closed class $\\mathcal{F}$,\nthere is a constant $c(\\mathcal{F})$ such that every graph of $\\mathcal{F}$\nwithout cycles of length less than $c(\\mathcal{F})$ has a 3-box representation,\nwhich is best possible.","authors":["Louis Esperet"],"meta":["April 2017Discrete & Computational Geometry 57(3)","DOI:10.1007/s00454-016-9837-8","SourcearXiv"],"references":["220532673_Star_Coloring_and_Acyclic_Coloring_of_Locally_Planar_Graphs","220441716_Ramanujan_Graphs","273787837_Boxicity_and_topological_invariants","260193286_A_Note_on_Circular_Chromatic_Number_of_Graphs_with_Large_Girth_and_Similar_Problems","256935634_From_the_plane_to_higher_surfaces","243774579_On_the_Boxicity_and_Cubicity_of_a_Graph","228687410_Disjoint_paths_planarizing_cycles_and_spanning_walks","223673520_Interval_representations_of_planar_graphs","222664776_High-Girth_Graphs_Avoiding_a_Minor_are_Nearly_Bipartite","220080959_On_circle_graphs_with_girth_at_least_five","1737506_Lower_Bounds_for_Boxicity","220078207_Five-Coloring_Maps_on_Surfaces","220076169_Graphs_on_the_Torus_and_Geometry_of_Numbers","51915987_Boxicity_of_Graphs_on_Surfaces"]}
