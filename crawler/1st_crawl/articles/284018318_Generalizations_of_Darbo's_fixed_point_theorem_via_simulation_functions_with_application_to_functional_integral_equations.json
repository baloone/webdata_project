{"id":"284018318_Generalizations_of_Darbo's_fixed_point_theorem_via_simulation_functions_with_application_to_functional_integral_equations","abstract":"In this paper, firstly, we introduce Zμ-contraction and ???μ-contraction via stimulation functions. Secondly, we prove some new fixed point theorems for Zμ-contractive mappings and ???μ-contractive mappings. Our results generalize and extend some existing results. Moreover, some examples and an application to functional integral equations are given to support the obtained results.","authors":["Jianhua Chen","Xianhua Tang"],"meta":["October 2015Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics 296","DOI:10.1016/j.cam.2015.10.012"],"references":["281578004_New_generalizations_of_Darbo's_fixed_point_theorem","277008846_A_New_Approach_to_the_Study_of_Fixed_Point_Theory_for_Simulation_Functions","270956554_An_Extension_of_Darbo's_Theorem_and_Its_Application","258399168_Compactness_Conditions_in_the_Study_of_Functional_Differential_and_Integral_Equations","257878494_A_generalization_of_Darbo's_fixed_point_and_common_solutions_of_equations_in_Banach_spaces","236151631_Some_generalizations_of_Darbo_fixed_point_theorem_and_applications","231789317_Fixed_point_theorems_by_altering_distances_between_the_points","223682944_An_application_of_measure_of_noncompactness_in_study_of_asymptotic_stability","288624720_Commuting_mappings_and_generalization_of_Darbo's_fixed_point_theorem","286552409_Existence_of_solutions_for_a_system_of_integral_equations_via_measure_of_noncompactness","274903072_Fixed_point_theorems_for_Meir-Keeler_condensing_operators_via_measure_of_noncompactness","266082042_Coincidence_point_theorems_on_metric_spaces_via_simulation_functions","265636298_On_Contractive_Mappings","259128012_A_generalization_of_Darbo's_theorem_with_application_to_the_solvability_of_systems_of_integral_equations","247299844_Punti_uniti_in_transformazioni_a_codomio_non_compatto","44397471_Measures_of_noncompactness_in_Banach_spaces_Josef_Banas_Kazimierz_Goebel","16585493_Nutritional_ocular_diseases_and_their_association_with_diarrhoea_in_Matlab_Bangladesh"]}
