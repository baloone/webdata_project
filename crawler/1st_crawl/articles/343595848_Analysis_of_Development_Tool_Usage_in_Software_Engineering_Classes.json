{"id":"343595848_Analysis_of_Development_Tool_Usage_in_Software_Engineering_Classes","abstract":"In this paper, the survey, dedicated to the usage of software systems in a software development process, is analysed. The survey was conducted among the students of Innopolis University. Based on the result of the survey, the following conclusions were made: (1) Windows, macOS and Linux-based operating systems have almost equal share of usage among future software developers (2) the most popular IDE is IntelliJ IDEA, however, to the end of the studying process students the diversity of IDEs usage increases (3) the mostly used code management system by far is Github, with almost 100% share (4) Trello and Jira are the most popular project management software for lightweight and complex industrial projects respectively. The obtained results will be used for the prioritization of the development of integration agents for InnoMetrics project, as well as for the adaptation of a studying process in academic institutions to make it more relevant to the given trends and for the market analysis of software engineering environment.","authors":["Shokhista Ergasheva","Vladimir Ivanov","Artem Kruglov","Andrey Sadovykh"],"meta":["August 2020","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-57663-9_19","Conference: International Workshop on Frontiers in Software Engineering Education"],"references":["288683724_Comparison_of_Requirement_Prioritization_Techniques_to_Find_Best_Prioritization_Technique","266657462_Can_execution_time_describe_accurately_the_energy_consumption_of_mobile_apps_an_experiment_in_Android","258432492_A_Method_for_Characterizing_Energy_Consumption_in_Android_Smartphones","257635400_Knowledge_transfer_in_system_modeling_and_its_realization_through_an_optimal_allocation_of_information_granularity","256720982_A_multivariate_classification_of_open_source_developers","254007340_Evolution_of_Mobile_Software_Development_from_Platform-Specific_to_Web-Based_Multiplatform_Paradigm","241632925_Understanding_the_impact_of_Pair_Programming_on_developers_attention_A_case_study_on_a_large_industrial_experimentation","234819083_Domain_analysis_and_framework-based_software_development","233426348_Adoption_of_freelibre_open_source_software_in_public_organizations_Factors_of_impact","228984902_Defining_Metrics_for_Software_Components","228848231_Service_oriented_programming_and_its_application_in_GIS_integration_a_new_paradigm_of_software_reuse","228770161_Open_source_software_for_the_public_administration","223940921_A_model_of_job_satisfaction_for_collaborative_development_processes","222648107_Genetic_granular_classifiers_in_modeling_software_quality","222577664_A_non-invasive_approach_to_product_metrics_collection","222428365_Measures_for_mobile_users_An_architecture","222416879_Early_estimation_of_software_size_in_object-oriented_environments_a_case_study_in_a_CMM_level_3_software_firm","221555535_A_Comparative_analysis_of_the_efficiency_of_change_metrics_and_static_code_attributes_for_defect_prediction","221554927_A_case-study_on_using_an_Automated_In-process_Software_Engineering_Measurement_and_Analysis_system_in_an_industrial_environment","221553195_Service_Oriented_Programming_A_New_Paradigm_of_Software_Reuse","221494942_Analysis_of_the_Reliability_of_a_Subset_of_Change_Metrics_for_Defect_Prediction","220999034_A_relational_approach_to_software_metrics","220758722_Data_structures_for_parallel_execution_of_functional_languages","220724940_Modelling_Failures_Occurrences_of_Open_Source_Software_with_Reliability_Growth","220724898_Comparing_OpenBRR_QSOS_and_OMM_assessment_models","220377825_Selecting_components_in_large_COTS_repositories","4147504_Open_source_software_and_open_data_standards_in_public_administration","3953980_On_the_sensitivity_of_COCOMO_II_software_cost_estimation_model","3850576_Extreme_programming_a_university_team_design_experience","3846297_Software_process_support_over_the_Internet","3188403_An_empirical_study_of_open-source_and_closed-source_software_products","3188166_Analysis_of_the_Effects_of_Software_Reuse_on_Customer_Satisfaction_in_an_RPG_Environment","2523137_Preliminary_Analysis_of_the_Effects_of_Pair_Programming_on_Job_Satisfaction","2486656_Preliminary_Results_from_an_Empirical_Study_on_the_Growth_of_Open_Source_and_Commercial_Software_Products","2401096_Software_Process_Support_over_the_Internet","347213364_What_is_heritage","344673399_Adopting_Open_Source_Software_A_Practical_Guide","271923649_Software_assurance_practices_for_mobile_applications_A_survey_of_the_state_of_the_art","259992733_Cooperation_Collaboration_and_Pair-Programming_Field_Studies_on_Backup_Behavior"]}
