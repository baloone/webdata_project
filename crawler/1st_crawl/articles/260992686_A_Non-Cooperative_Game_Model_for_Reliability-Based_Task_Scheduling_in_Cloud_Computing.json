{"id":"260992686_A_Non-Cooperative_Game_Model_for_Reliability-Based_Task_Scheduling_in_Cloud_Computing","abstract":"Cloud computing is a newly emerging distributed system which is evolved from\nGrid computing. Task scheduling is the core research of cloud computing which\nstudies how to allocate the tasks among the physical nodes, so that the tasks\ncan get a balanced allocation or each task's execution cost decreases to the\nminimum, or the overall system performance is optimal. Unlike task scheduling\nbased on time or cost before, aiming at the special reliability requirements in\ncloud computing, we propose a non-cooperative game model for reliability-based\ntask scheduling appraoch. This model takes the steady-state availability that\ncomputing nodes provides as the target, takes the task slicing strategy of the\nschedulers as the game strategy, then finds the Nash equilibrium solution. And\nalso, we design a task scheduling algorithm based on this model. The\nexperiments can be seen that our task scheduling algorithm is better than the\nso-called balanced scheduling algorithm.","authors":["Kai Li","Yong Wang","Meilin Liu"],"meta":["October 2020International Journal of Communication Systems 33(10)","DOI:10.1002/dac.4512","SourcearXiv"],"references":["344960238_Surrogate-assisted_particle_swarm_optimization_algorithm_with_Pareto_active_learning_for_expensive_multi-objective_optimization","338438654_Biobjective_Task_Scheduling_for_Distributed_Green_Data_Centers","332952276_Profit-Sensitive_Spatial_Scheduling_of_Multi-Application_Tasks_in_Distributed_Green_Clouds","328621172_Temporal_Task_Scheduling_of_Multiple_Delay-Constrained_Applications_in_Green_Hybrid_Cloud","326307765_Dendritic_Neuron_Model_With_Effective_Learning_Algorithms_for_Classification_Approximation_and_Prediction","313541218_Percentile_Performance_Estimation_of_Unreliable_IaaS_Clouds_and_Their_Cost-Optimal_Capacity_Decision","297371009_RASA_A_new_task_scheduling_algorithm_in_grid_environment","289748420_Nash_equilibrium_based_task_scheduling_algorithm_of_multi-schedulers_in_grid_computing","286873519_Research_of_Resource_Scheduling_Strategy_in_Cloud_Computing","286813497_A_Task_Scheduling_Algorithm_Based_on_Genetic_Algorithm_and_Ant_Colony_Optimization_in_Cloud_Computing","281643996_Generalized_Nash_Equilibria_for_the_Service_Provisioning_Problem_in_Multi-Cloud_Systems","278657964_An_Improved_Min-Min_Algorithm_in_Cloud_Computing","277391225_Task_scheduling_algorithm_based_on_improved_genetic_algorithm_in_cloud_computing_environment","273509661_Stochastic_Modeling_and_Performance_Analysis_of_Migration-Enabled_and_Error-Prone_Clouds","271012617_Reliability_analysis_MG1_queues_with_general_retrial_times_and_server_breakdowns"]}
