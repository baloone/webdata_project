{"id":"4274461_Component-Based_and_Service-Oriented_Software_Engineering_Key_Concepts_and_Principles","abstract":"Component-based software engineering (CBSE) and service-oriented software engineering (SOSE) are two of the most dominant engineering paradigms in current software community and industry. Although they have continued their development tracks in parallel and have different focus, both paradigms have similarities in many senses, which also have resulted in confusion in understanding and applying similar concepts or the same concepts designated differently. In this paper, we present a comparison analysis framework of CBSE and SOSE and analyze them from a variety of perspectives. We discuss as well the possibility of combining the strengths of the two paradigms to meet non-functional requirements. The contribution of this paper is to clarify the characteristics of CBSE and SOSE, shorten the gap between them and bring the two worlds together so that researchers and practitioners become aware of essential issues of both paradigms, which may serve as inputs for further utilizing them in a reasonable and complementary way.","authors":["Hongyu Pei Breivold","Magnus Larsson"],"meta":["September 2007Conference Proceedings of the EUROMICRO","DOI:10.1109/EUROMICRO.2007.25","SourceIEEE Xplore","Conference: Software Engineering and Advanced Applications, 2007. 33rd EUROMICRO Conference on"],"references":["318419246_A_Method_for_Formulating_and_Architecting_Component-_and_Service-Oriented_Systems","314828809_The_evolution_of_software_evolvability","314417592_A_Method_for_Formulating_and_Architecting_Component-_and_Service-Oriented_Systems","313705684_Software_lifetime_and_its_evolution_process_over_generations","313102610_Dependable_computing_and_fault_tolerance_Concepts_and_terminology","289753582_The_next_challenge_Aspect-oriented_programming","285402769_The_Role_of_Architecture_and_Evolutionary_Development_in_Accommodating_Change","270960231_Reverse_engineering_and_design_recovery_A_taxonomy","269032803_Software_quality_challenges","267375840_Metrics_and_Laws_of_Software_Evolution"]}
