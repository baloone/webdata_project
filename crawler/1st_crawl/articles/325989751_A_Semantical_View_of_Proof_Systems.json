{"id":"325989751_A_Semantical_View_of_Proof_Systems","abstract":"In this work, we explore proof theoretical connections between sequent, nested and labelled calculi. In particular, we show a semantical characterisation of intuitionistic, normal and non-normal modal logics for all these systems, via a case-by-case translation between labelled nested to labelled sequent systems.","authors":["Elaine Pimentel"],"meta":["June 2018","DOI:10.1007/978-3-662-57669-4_3","In book: Logic, Language, Information, and Computation (pp.61-76)"],"references":["317686348_Sequent_Systems_for_Negative_Modalities","314092817_Modularisation_of_Sequent_Calculi_for_Normal_and_Non-normal_Modalities","280561781_Linear_Nested_Sequents_2-Sequents_and_Hypersequents","267111975_Nested_Sequents_for_Intuitionistic_Logics","225983892_The_Method_of_Tree-Hypersequents_for_Modal_Propositional_Logic","225788229_Proof_Analysis_in_Modal_Logic","220592447_Proof_Analysis_in_Intermediate_Logics","335335182_Sequentialising_Nested_Systems","317265831_A_uniform_framework_for_substructural_logics_with_modalities","275748872_Investigations_into_Logical_Deduction","266859257_Labelled_tree_sequents_tree_hypersequents_and_nested_Deep_sequents","262159774_Cut_Elimination_in_Nested_Sequents_for_Intuitionistic_Modal_Logics","242640524_Modal_Logic_An_Introduction","238766985_Investigations_into_Logical_Deduction_II","227220144_Indexed_Systems_of_Sequents_and_Cut-Elimination","226570137_Deep_Sequent_Systems_for_Modal_Logic","220695785_Labelled_Non-Classical_Logics","38354212_Eine_Darstellung_der_Intuitionistischen_Logik_in_der_Klassischen"]}
