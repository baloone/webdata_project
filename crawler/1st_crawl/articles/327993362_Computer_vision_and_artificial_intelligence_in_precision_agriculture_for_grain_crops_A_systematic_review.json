In this sense, the demand for efficient and safe methods of food production is increasing. Information Technology is one of the tools to that end. Among the available tools, we highlight computer vision solutions combined with artificial intelligence algorithms that achieved important results in the detection of patterns in images. In this context, this work presents a systematic review that aims to identify the applicability of computer vision in precision agriculture for the production of the five most produced grains in the world: maize, rice, wheat, soybean, and barley. In this sense, we present 25 papers selected in the last five years with different approaches to treat aspects related to disease detection, grain quality, and phenotyping. From the results of the systematic review, it is possible to identify great opportunities, such as the exploitation of GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) and advanced artificial intelligence techniques, such as DBN (Deep Belief Networks) in the construction of robust methods of computer vision applied to precision agriculture.","authors":["Diego Inácio Patrício","Rafael Rieder"],"meta":["October 2018Computers and Electronics in Agriculture 153:69-81","DOI:10.1016/j.compag.2018.08.001"],"references":["328250333_Machine_Learning_An_Algorithmic_Perspective","302065771_An_Efficient_Technique_for_Rice_Grain_Classification_Using_Back_Propagation_Neural_Network_and_Wavelet_Decomposition"]}
