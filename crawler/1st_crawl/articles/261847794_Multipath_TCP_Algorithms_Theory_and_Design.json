{"id":"261847794_Multipath_TCP_Algorithms_Theory_and_Design","abstract":"Multi-path TCP (MP-TCP) has the potential to greatly improve application performance by using multiple paths transparently. We propose a fluid model for a large class of MP-TCP algorithms and identify design criteria that guarantee the existence, uniqueness, and stability of system equilibrium. We characterize algorithm parameters for TCP-friendliness and prove an inevitable tradeoff between responsiveness and friendliness. We discuss the implications of these properties on the behavior of existing algorithms and motivate a new design that generalizes existing algorithms. We use ns2 simulations to evaluate the proposed algorithm and illustrate its superior overall performance.","authors":["Qiuyu Peng","Anwar Walid","Steven Low"],"meta":["June 2013ACM SIGMETRICS Performance Evaluation Review 41(1):305-316","DOI:10.1145/2465529.2466585","Conference: Proceedings of the ACM SIGMETRICS/international conference on Measurement and modeling of computer systemsVolume: 41"],"references":["262238985_Design_implementation_and_evaluation_of_congestion_control_for_multipath_TCP","228763107_Multipath_congestion_control_for_shared_bottleneck","4102847_Opportunistic_traffic_scheduling_over_multiple_network_paths","4102801_Is_fair_allocation_always_inefficient","2940874_Is_Fair_Allocation_Always_Inefficient","2871439_Overlay_TCP_for_Multi-Path_Routing_and_Congestion_Control","2502252_Rate_Control_for_Communication_NetworksShadow_Prices_Proportional_Fairness_and_Stability","220880974_A_Transport_Layer_Approach_for_Improving_End-to-End_Performance_and_Robustness_Using_Redundant_Paths","220195067_Stability_of_end-to-end_algorithms_for_joint_routing_and_rate_control","220156662_On_Contraction_Analysis_for_Nonlinear_Systems","3335246_Concurrent_Multipath_Transfer_Using_SCTP_Multihoming_Over_Independent_End-to-End_Paths","3334912_A_duality_model_of_TCP_and_queue_management_algorithms","3334654_Optimization_Flow_Control-I_Basic_Algorithm_and_Convergence","2894476_A_Transport_Layer_Approach_for_Improving_End-to-End_Performance_and_Robustness_Using_Redundant_Paths"]}
