{"id":"270820426_Making_Sense_of_Cronbach's_Alpha","abstract":"Medical educators attempt to create reliable and valid tests and questionnaires in order to enhance the accuracy of their assessment and evaluations. Validity and reliability are two fundamental elements in the evaluation of a measurement instrument. Instruments can be conventional knowledge, skill or attitude tests, clinical simulations or survey questionnaires. Instruments can measure concepts, psychomotor skills or affective values. Validity is concerned with the extent to which an instrument measures what it is intended to measure. Reliability is concerned with the ability of an instrument to measure consistently.1 It should be noted that the reliability of an instrument is closely associated with its validity. An instrument cannot be valid unless it is reliable. However, the reliability of an instrument does not depend on its validity.2 It is possible to objectively measure the reliability of an instrument and in this paper we explain the meaning of Cronbachâ€™s alpha, the most widely used objective measure of reliability.","authors":["Mohsen Tavakol","Reg Dennick"],"meta":["June 2011International Journal of Medical Education 2:53-55","DOI:10.5116/ijme.4dfb.8dfd"],"references":["309254394_Psychometric_Theory","279002791_What_Is_Coefficient_Alpha_An_Examination_of_Theory_and_Applications","270540138_The_structured_clinical_interview_for_DSM-III-R_personality_disorders_SCID-II_part_I_description","258136149_Congeneric_and_Essentially_Tau-Equivalent_Estimates_of_Score_Reliability_What_They_Are_and_How_to_Use_Them","247742992_A_Comparison_of_Selected_Empirical_Methods_for_Assessing_the_Structure_of_Responses_to_Test_Items","247726089_Limitations_of_Coefficient_Alpha_as_an_Index_of_Test_Unidimensionality1","241730455_Coefficient_Alpha_A_Basic_Introduction_From_the_Perspectives_of_Classical_Test_Theory_and_Structural_Equation_Modeling","232263112_Statistics_Notes_Cronbach's_Alpha","228991258_Applied_Dimensionality_and_Test_Structure_Assessment_With_the_START-M_Mathematics_Test","228079798_Uses_and_Abuses_of_Coefficient_Alpha"]}
