{"id":"322642718_SiGe_epitaxial_memory_for_neuromorphic_computing_with_reproducible_high_performance_based_on_engineered_dislocations","abstract":"Although several types of architecture combining memory cells and transistors have been used to demonstrate artificial synaptic arrays, they usually present limited scalability and high power consumption. Transistor-free analog switching devices may overcome these limitations, yet the typical switching process they rely on-formation of filaments in an amorphous medium-is not easily controlled and hence hampers the spatial and temporal reproducibility of the performance. Here, we demonstrate analog resistive switching devices that possess desired characteristics for neuromorphic computing networks with minimal performance variations using a single-crystalline SiGe layer epitaxially grown on Si as a switching medium. Such epitaxial random access memories utilize threading dislocations in SiGe to confine metal filaments in a defined, one-dimensional channel. This confinement results in drastically enhanced switching uniformity and long retention/high endurance with a high analog on/off ratio. Simulations using the MNIST handwritten recognition data set prove that epitaxial random access memories can operate with an online learning accuracy of 95.1%.","authors":["Shinhyun Choi","Scott Tan","Zefan Li","Yunjo Kim"],"meta":["April 2018Nature Materials 17(4)","DOI:10.1038/s41563-017-0001-5"],"references":["308668975_Memristors_with_diffusive_dynamics_as_synaptic_emulators_for_neuromorphic_computing","308457764_Quantized_Neural_Networks_Training_Neural_Networks_with_Low_Precision_Weights_and_Activations","301854083_Acceleration_of_Deep_Neural_Network_Training_with_Resistive_Cross-Point_Devices","345642705_Phase_Transformations_in_Metals_and_Alloys_Revised_Reprint","322810552_NeuroSim_An_integrated_device-to-algorithm_framework_for_benchmarking_synaptic_devices_and_array_architectures","313878822_A_non-volatile_organic_electrochemical_device_as_a_low-voltage_artificial_synapse_for_neuromorphic_computing","310825015_Design_of_Resistive_Synaptic_Array_for_Implementing_On-Chip_Sparse_Learning","308746814_Efficient_training_algorithms_for_neural_networks_based_on_memristive_crossbar_circuits","306202698_Experimental_demonstration_and_tolerancing_of_a_large-scale_neural_network_165_000_synapses_using_phase-change_memory_as_the_synaptic_weight_element","304414594_Scaling-up_resistive_synaptic_arrays_for_neuro-inspired_architecture_Challenges_and_prospect","292158523_Synthesis_of_Metastable_NiGe2_by_mechanical_alloying","300416339_Modeling_and_implementation_of_firing-rate_neuromorphic-network_classifiers_with_bilayer_PtAl2O3TiO2-xPt_Memristors","297676440_Tuning_Ionic_Transport_in_Memristive_Devices_by_Graphene_with_Engineered_Nanopores","287633598_Structural_Inorganic_Chemistry","284172465_Mechanism_for_Conducting_Filament_Growth_in_Self-Assembled_Polymer_Thin_Films_for_Redox-Based_Atomic_Switches"]}
