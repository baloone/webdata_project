{"id":"315382940_More_Restricted_Growth_Functions_Gray_Codes_and_Exhaustive_Generation","abstract":"A Gray code for a combinatorial class is a method for listing the objects in the class so that successive objects differ in some prespecified, small way, typically expressed as a bounded Hamming distance. In a previous work, the authors of the present paper showed, among other things, that the $m$-ary Reflected Gray Code Order yields a Gray code for the set of restricted growth functions. Here we further investigate variations of this order relation, and give the first Gray codes and efficient generating algorithms for bounded restricted growth functions.","authors":["Ahmad Sabri","Vincent Vajnovszki"],"meta":["May 2017Graphs and Combinatorics 33(7)","DOI:10.1007/s00373-017-1774-7"],"references":["280445715_The_On-Line_Encyclopedia_of_Integer_Sequences","261369019_Gray_code_orders_for_q-ary_words_avoiding_a_given_factor","282298277_Reflected_Gray_codes_for_q-ary_words_avoiding_a_given_factor","241278857_Two_Reflected_Gray_Code-Based_Orders_on_Some_Restricted_Growth_Sequences","237005299_Combinatorial_Generation"]}
