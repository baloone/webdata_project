{"id":"326035060_Gradual-Cooling_Solidification_Approach_to_Alleviate_Macrosegregation_in_Large_Steel_Ingots","abstract":"Based on the mechanisms of macrosegregation evolution in large steel ingots, an approach named as gradual-cooling solidification (GCS) was proposed to alleviate the macrosegregation of large steel ingots. A three-phase mixed columnar dendritic-equiaxed solidification model was employed to investigate the approach. The solidification model considered the dendritic structure of equiaxed grains, nucleation and growth of equiaxed crystals, growth of columnar trunks, thermal-solutal buoyancy, sedimentation of equiaxed crystals, and columnar-to-equiaxed transition (CET). After the verification of model accuracy by a reported experiment results of a 55-ton steel ingot, this model has been used to study the GCS approach. The simulation results showed that the GCS approach has significant potential to alleviate the macrosegregation of the large steel ingot; e.g., for a 55-ton steel ingot, the variation range of segregation value decreased from 0.854 in the conventional casting case to 0.077 in the GCS case.","authors":["Honghao Ge","Fengli Ren","Duanxin Cai","Jing Hao"],"meta":["June 2018Journal of Materials Processing Technology 262","DOI:10.1016/j.jmatprotec.2018.06.041"],"references":["312415682_Four-Phase_Dendritic_Model_for_the_Prediction_of_Macrosegregation_Shrinkage_Cavity_and_Porosity_in_a_55-Ton_Ingot","268754759_Corrigendum_Inclusion_flotation-driven_channel_segregation_in_solidifying_steels","262055360_Simulation_of_macrosegregation_in_a_245-ton_steel_ingot_using_a_three-phase_mixed_columnar-equiaxed_model","226865928_A_three-phase_model_for_mixed_columnar-equiaxed_solidification","225821163_Using_a_Three-Phase_Deterministic_Model_for_the_Columnar-to-Equiaxed_Transition","200743408_Prediction_of_Macrosegregation_in_Steel_Ingots_Influence_of_the_Motion_and_the_Morphology_of_Equiaxed_Grains","318690900_A_Homogeneous_Billet_Layer_Casting_Fabrication_Method","313703668_Transport_Phenomena","292549964_A_AND_V_SEGREGATION_IN_KILLED_STEEL_INGOTS","283100688_Dendritic_model_for_macrosegregation_prediction_of_large_scale_castings","257791111_Numerical_simulation_of_macrosegregation_in_steel_ingots_using_a_two-phase_model","257709144_Modeling_of_Species_Transport_and_Macrosegregation_in_Heavy_Steel_Ingots","257345142_A_novel_technique_for_reducing_macrosegregation_in_heavy_steel_ingots","226649922_Simulation_of_convection_and_macrosegregation_in_a_large_steel_ingot","225959448_Equiaxed_dendritic_solidification_with_convection_Part_I_Multiscalemultiphase_modeling","225334316_Macrosegregation_in_a_multicomponent_low_alloy_steel","37426216_Modelling_of_microstructure_formation_in_solidification_processes"]}
