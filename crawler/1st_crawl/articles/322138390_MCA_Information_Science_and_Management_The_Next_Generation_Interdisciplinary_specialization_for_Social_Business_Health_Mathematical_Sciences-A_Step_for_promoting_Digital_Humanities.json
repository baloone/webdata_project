Information and its growing number is the main reason behind the requirement of information and similar domain. Information Science is actually an interdisciplinary domain combines with so many subjects related to information and processing of data and similar facet. Computer is one of the important gradients in Information Science for healthy and sophisticated information system designing and development. In the education sector, there are so many courses available which are related to computers such as Computer Science, Computer Application, Computer Science and Engineering, IT and so on and comes with so many nomenclatures and levels. Information Science is also a computer related subject but having information concentration. MCA is one of the important and popular courses in computing applications in India; which deals with IT applications in the industrial and society problems. This paper talks about MCA in respect of possibilities of Information Science specialization in such programme for better information infrastructure development. Several contents of this paper are directly included in the thesis of the author (for obtaining research degree) and the fact is hereby acknowledged. Paper deals with many aspects of Information Science including its need and characteristics, educational situation in India and globally in brief manner and way to introduce this proposal in contemporary Indian MCA programme.","authors":["Sreeramana Aithal","P.K.
