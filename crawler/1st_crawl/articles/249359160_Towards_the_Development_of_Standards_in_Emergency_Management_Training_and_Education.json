{"id":"249359160_Towards_the_Development_of_Standards_in_Emergency_Management_Training_and_Education","abstract":"This paper discusses the possible future role of standards in assuring the quality and content of programmes for educating and training people in the fields of emergency planning and management. Principles for the establishment of standards are presented. Existing standards in the civil protection and emergency preparedness fields are reviewed. The requisites for a training standard are described. Finally, a prototype standard is presented. The paper also addresses the question of whether standards are appropriate instruments and concludes that they would help ensure comparability, quality assurance and international compatibility of training.","authors":["David Alexander"],"meta":["May 2003Disaster Prevention and Management 12(2):113-123","DOI:10.1108/09653560310474223"],"references":["256551574_Evaluation_Criteria_for_Emergency_Response_Plans_in_Radiological_Transportation","242339192_Emergency_response_preparedness_Small_group_training_Part_I_training_and_learning_styles","238439521_Policies_and_Standards_for_Reoccupancy_Repair_of_Earthquake-Damaged_Buildings","235285608_Emergency_response_preparedness_Small_group_training_Part_2_-_Training_methods_compared_with_learning_styles","14048954_SUMA_Supply_Management_Project_a_management_tool_for_post-disaster_relief_supplies","13132486_Criteria_for_the_Assessment_of_Disaster_Preparedness-II","11695283_The_Continuing_Debate_over_Risk-related_Standards_of_Competence","11161373_Nutritional_Response_to_the_1998_Bangladesh_Flood_Disaster_Sphere_Minimum_Standards_in_Disaster_Response"]}
