{"id":"225368237_On_Multivariate_Compactly_Supported_Bi-Frames","abstract":"In this article, we construct compactly supported multivariate pairs of dual wavelet frames, shortly called bi-frames, for\nan arbitrary dilation matrix. Our construction is based on the mixed oblique extension principle, and it provides bi-frames\nwith few wavelets. In the examples, we obtain optimal bi-frames, i.e., primal and dual wavelets are constructed from a single\nfundamental refinable function, whose mask size is minimal w.r.t. sum rule order and smoothness. Moreover, the wavelets reach\nthe maximal approximation orderw.r.t. the underlying refinable function. For special dilation matrices, we derive very simple\nbut optimal arbitrarily smooth bi-frames in arbitrary dimensions with only two primal and dual wavelets.","authors":["Martin Ehler"],"meta":["October 2007Journal of Fourier Analysis and Applications 13(5):511-532","DOI:10.1007/s00041-006-6021-1"],"references":["243135022_Compactly_supported_tight_affine_spline_frames_in_L2Rd","265370190_Tight_compactly_supported_wavelet_frames_of_arbitrarily_high_smoothness","257151294_Affine_systems_inL_2_R_d_II_Dual_systems","256756220_Affine_Systems_inL2Rd_The_Analysis_of_the_Analysis_Operator","246103218_Ane_systems_in_L2IR_d_the_analysis_of_the_analysis_operator","245780488_Construction_of_Multivariate_Tight_Frames_via_Kronecker_Products","243777573_Degree_of_nonlinear_approximation","243047203_Interpolating_refinable_functions_and_wavelets_for_general_scaling","232019582_Nonlinear_Approximation","227649302_Multivariate_Compactly_Supported_Fundamental_Refinable_Functions_Duals_and_Biorthogonal_Wavelets"]}
