{"id":"302581064_On_the_Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov_Lemma_for_Positive_Systems","abstract":"An extended Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov (KYP) Lemma for positive systems is derived. The main difference compared to earlier versions is that non-strict inequalities are treated. Matrix assumptions are also less restrictive. Moreover, a new equivalence is introduced in terms of linear programming rather than semi-definite programming. As a complement to the KYP lemma, it is also proved that a symmetric Metzler matrix with m nonzero entries above the diagonal is negative semi-definite if and only if it can be written as a sum of m negative semi-definite matrices, each of which has only four nonzero entries. This is useful in the context large-scale optimization.","authors":["Anders Rantzer"],"meta":["May 2016IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control 61(5):1346-1349","DOI:10.1109/TAC.2015.2465571"],"references":["259738596_Robust_stability_and_stabilization_of_uncertain_Linear_Positive_Systems_via_Integral_Linear_Constraints_-_L_1-_and_L_infty-gains_characterizations","241636769_L1_gain_analysis_of_linear_positive_systems_and_its_application","2495474_Exact_Solutions_of_Some_Nonconvex_Quadratic_Optimization_Problems_via_SDP_and_SOCP_Relaxations","276152611_Scalable_Control_of_Positive_Systems","266853637_Plemmons_RJ_Nonnegative_Matrices_in_the_Mathematical_Sciences_SIAM_Philadelphia_PA","263495020_On_the_Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov_lemma_for_discrete-time_positive_linear_systems_A_novel_simple_proof_and_some_related_results","262349465_On_the_Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov_lemma","261460043_On_the_Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov_Lemma_for_Positive_Systems","225163172_Kalman-Popov-Yakubovich_lemma_and_the_S-procedure_A_historical_essay","225075430_Positive_linear_systems_Theory_and_applications","223079041_Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov_Lemma_for_matrix_frequency_domain_inequality","221667878_Distributed_Control_of_Positive_Systems","220387153_The_Bounded_Real_Lemma_for_Internally_Positive_Systems_and_H-Infinity_Structured_Static_State_Feedback","3032036_Generalized_KYP_lemma_Unified_frequency_domain_inequalities_with_design_applications"]}
