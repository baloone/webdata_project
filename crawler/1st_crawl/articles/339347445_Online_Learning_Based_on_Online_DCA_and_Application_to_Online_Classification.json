{"id":"339347445_Online_Learning_Based_on_Online_DCA_and_Application_to_Online_Classification","abstract":"We investigate an approach based on DC (difference of convex functions) programming and DCA (dc algorithm) for online learning techniques. The prediction problem of an online learner can be formulated as a DC program for which online DCA is applied. We propose the two so-called complete/approximate versions of online DCA scheme and prove their logarithmic/sublinear regrets. Six online DCA-based algorithms are developed for online binary linear classification. Numerical experiments on a variety of benchmark classification data sets show the efficiency of our proposed algorithms in comparison with the state-of-the-art online classification algorithms.","authors":["Hoai An Le Thi","Vinh Thanh Ho"],"meta":["February 2020Neural Computation 32(1):1-35","DOI:10.1162/neco_a_01266"],"references":["327148651_A_unified_DC_programming_framework_and_efficient_DCA_based_approaches_for_large_scale_batch_reinforcement_learning","309514572_DCA_based_algorithms_for_feature_selection_in_multi-class_support_vector_machine","307527326_Introduction_to_Online_Convex_Optimization","294283188_DC_programming_and_DCA_for_sparse_Fisher_linear_discriminant_analysis","285851582_Frank_Rosenblatt_Principles_of_Neurodynamics_Perceptrons_and_the_Theory_of_Brain_Mechanisms","228397557_Online_Submodular_Minimization","225918204_Logarithmic_Regret_Algorithms_for_Online_Convex_Optimization","221618845_Boosting_Algorithms_as_Gradient_Descent","220699588_Online_Learning_in_Adversarial_Lipschitz_Environments","220690817_Prediction_Learning_and_Games","220527410_Batch_and_online_learning_algorithms_for_Nonconvex_Neyman-Pearson_classification","220343561_The_Robustness_of_the_p-Norm_Algorithms","220320740_A_New_Approximate_Maximal_Margin_Classification_Algorithm","220320403_Large_scale_transductive_SVMs","220320111_Online_Passive-Aggressive_Algorithms","41781474_Trading_Convexity_for_Scalability","2320537_The_Relaxed_Online_Maximum_Margin_Algorithm","334238492_Group_variable_selection_via_l_p_0_regularization_and_application_to_optimal_scoring","330462538_An_Optimal_Algorithm_for_Online_Non-Convex_Learning","326206343_Accelerated_Difference_of_Convex_functions_Algorithm_and_its_Application_to_Sparse_Binary_Logistic_Regression","325747960_An_Optimal_Algorithm_for_Online_Non-Convex_Learning","322694621_DC_programming_and_DCA_thirty_years_of_developments","321847509_Recent_Advances_in_DC_Programming_and_DCA","320093650_Sparse_Covariance_Matrix_Estimation_by_DCA-Based_Algorithms","313591186_Convex_analysis_approaches_to_DC_programming_Theory_algorithms_and_applications","309092302_Online_DC_Optimization_for_Online_Binary_Linear_Classification","281481449_Recent_advances_in_DC_programming_and_DCA","279647699_LIBOL_A_library_for_online_learning_algorithms","277213243_Online_Learning_Theory_Algorithms_and_Applications","267111364_Sous-differentiels_d'une_borne_superieure_et_d'une_somme_continue_de_fonctions_convexes","263241999_Relative_Loss_Bounds_for_On-Line_Density_Estimation_with_the_Exponential_Family_of_Distributions","243787523_A_DC_Optimization_Algorithm_for_Solving_the_Trust-Region_Subproblem","236736838_Minimization_Methods_for_Non-Differentiable_Functions","236736762_Online_Learning_and_Online_Convex_Optimization","235332945_Relative_Loss_Bounds_for_On-Line_Density_Estimation_with_the_Exponential_Family_of_Distributions","226793652_Relative_Loss_Bounds_for_Multidimensional_Regression_Problems","225263857_The_DC_Difference_of_Convex_Functions_Programming_and_DCA_Revisited_with_DC_Models_of_Real_World_Nonconvex_Optimization_Problems","224141988_Nonconvex_Online_Support_Vector_Machines","222302500_Efficient_Algorithms_for_Online_Decision_Problems","221996769_The_perceptron_A_probabilistic_model_for_information_storage_and_organization_in_the_brain_J","221497740_Approximate_Methods_for_Sequential_Decision_Making_Using_Expert_Advice","220343542_A_primal-dual_perspective_of_online_learning_algorithms","2428543_Exponentiated_Gradient_Versus_Gradient_Descent_for_Linear_Predictors"]}
