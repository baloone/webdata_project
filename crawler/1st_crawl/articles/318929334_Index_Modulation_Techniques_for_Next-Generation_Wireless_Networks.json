{"id":"318929334_Index_Modulation_Techniques_for_Next-Generation_Wireless_Networks","abstract":"What is index modulation (IM)? This is an interesting question that we have started to hear more and more frequently over the past few years. The aim of this article is to answer this question in a comprehensive manner by covering not only the basic principles and emerging variants of IM, but also reviewing the most recent as well as promising advances in this field towards the application scenarios foreseen in next-generation wireless networks. More specifically, we investigate three forms of IM: spatial modulation (SM), channel modulation (CM) and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing with index modulation (OFDM-IM), which consider the transmit antennas of a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system, the radio frequency (RF) mirrors (parasitic elements) mounted at a transmit antenna and the subcarriers of an OFDM system for IM techniques, respectively. We present the up-to-date advances in these three promising frontiers, and discuss possible future research directions for IM-based schemes towards low-complexity, spectrum-and energy-efficient next-generation wireless networks.","authors":["Ertugrul Basar","Miaowen Wen","Raed Mesleh","Marco Di Renzo"],"meta":["August 2017IEEE Access 5(99)","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2737528","Projects: Index modulation for 5G wireless communicationsIndex Modulation Techniques for Next-Generation Wireless Networks"],"references":["327903089_Single-Carrier_SM-MIMO_A_Promising_Design_for_Broadband_Large-Scale_Antenna_Systems","321431789_Index_Modulation_for_5G_Wireless_Communications","320544497_A_Multilevel_Code_Shifted_Differential_Chaos_Shift_Keying_Scheme_With_Code_Index_Modulation","319758903_Performance_of_Generalized_Spatial_Modulation_MIMO_over_Measured_60_GHz_Indoor_Channels","322872825_Space-time_quadrature_spatial_modulation","321499053_Index_Modulation_for_5G_Wireless_Communications","319408865_Multidimensional_index_modulation_in_wireless_communications","318892621_Full-duplex_spatial_modulation_systems_under_imperfect_channel_state_information","318856012_MIMO_Cooperative_Spatial_Modulation_Systems","318810754_Low-complexity_near-optimal_detector_for_multiple-input_multiple-output_OFDM_with_index_modulation"]}
