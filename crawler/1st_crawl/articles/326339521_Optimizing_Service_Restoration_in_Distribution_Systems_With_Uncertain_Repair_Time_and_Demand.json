{"id":"326339521_Optimizing_Service_Restoration_in_Distribution_Systems_With_Uncertain_Repair_Time_and_Demand","abstract":"This paper proposes a novel method to co-optimize distribution system operation and repair crew routing for outage restoration after extreme weather events. A two-stage stochastic mixed integer linear program is developed to dispatch distributed generators, reconfigure the distribution network, and efficiently dispatch the repair crews to damaged components. We consider demand uncertainty and model the uncertainty of the repair time using a lognormal distribution. A new decomposition approach, combined with the Progressive Hedging algorithm, is developed for solving large-scale outage management problems in an effective and timely manner. The proposed method is validated on modified IEEE 34- and 8500-bus distribution test systems.","authors":["Anmar Arif","Shanshan Ma","Zhaoyu Wang","Jianhui Wang"],"meta":["July 2018Power Systems, IEEE Transactions on PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TPWRS.2018.2855102","Project: Optimization of distribution network repair and restoration "],"references":["282027583_A_Practical_and_Cost_Effective_Cold_Load_Pickup_Management_Using_Remote_Control","267946073_Vehicle_Routing_for_the_Last_Mile_of_Power_System_Restoration","226664228_Scenario_reduction_in_stochastic_programming_An_approach_using_probability_metrics","2837745_Evaluation_of_Scenario-Generation_Methods_for_Stochastic_Programming","324175975_Resilience_Enhancement_of_Distribution_Grids_Against_Extreme_Weather_Events","317497240_Networked_Microgrids_for_Service_Restoration_in_Resilient_Distribution_Systems","312259009_Power_Distribution_System_Outage_Management_With_Co-Optimization_of_Repairs_Reconfiguration_and_DG_Dispatch","309142859_Service_Restoration_Based_On_AMI_and_Networked_Microgrids_Under_Extreme_Weather_Events","305417399_Resilience_Enhancement_Strategy_for_Distribution_Systems_Under_Extreme_Weather_Events","277659031_Stochastic_DG_Placement_for_Conservation_Voltage_Reduction_Based_on_Multiple_Replications_Procedure","276886807_Transmission_system_repair_and_restoration","273395264_Proactive_Recovery_of_Electric_Power_Assets_for_Resiliency_Enhancement","270791297_Coordinated_Energy_Management_of_Networked_Microgrids_in_Distribution_Systems","260497468_A_Mixed-Integer_Linear_Programming_Approach_for_the_Computation_of_the_Minimum-Losses_Radial_Configuration_of_Electrical_Distribution_Networks","247442902_Introduction_To_Algorithms","239765941_Minimum_Loss_Network_Reconfiguration_Using_Mixed-Integer_Convex_Programming","225124986_Progressive_Hedging_Innovations_for_a_Class_of_Stochastic_Resource_Allocation_Problems","220413044_Fifty_Years_of_Vehicle_Routing","3271035_Optimal_Capacitor_Placement_on_Radial_Distribution_Systems","3267030_Self-Healing_Reconfiguration_for_Restoration_of_Naval_Shipboard_Power_Systems"]}
