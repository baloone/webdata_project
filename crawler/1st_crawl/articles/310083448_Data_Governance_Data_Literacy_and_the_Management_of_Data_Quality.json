{"id":"310083448_Data_Governance_Data_Literacy_and_the_Management_of_Data_Quality","abstract":"Data governance and data literacy are two important building blocks in the\nknowledge base of information professionals, involved in supporting dataintensive\nresearch, and both address data quality and research data\nmanagement.\nApplying data governance to research data management processes and data\nliteracy education helps in delineating decision domains and defining\naccountability for decision making. Adopting data governance is advantageous,\nbecause it is a service based on standardised, repeatable processes and is\ndesigned to enable the transparency of data-related processes and cost\nreduction. It is also useful, because it refers to rules, policies, standards;\ndecision rights; accountabilities and methods of enforcement. Therefore,\nalthough it received more attention in corporate settings and some of the skills\nrelated to it are already possessed by librarians, knowledge on data governance\nis foundational for research data services, especially as it appears on all levels\nof research data services, and is applicable to big data.","authors":["Tibor Koltay"],"meta":["September 2016IFLA Journal DOI: 10.1177/0340035216672238(4)","DOI:10.1177/0340035216672238"],"references":["351735627_Research_Data_Curation_and_Management_Bibliography","321818002_Information_Literacy_Education_in_the_UK_Reflections_on_Perspectives_and_Practical_Approaches_of_Curricular_Integration","308565509_Data_informed_learning_A_next_phase_data_literacy_framework_for_higher_education","299669357_Research_Data_Literacy","294779562_Information_Overload_Maybe_Not","287799280_Research_Data_Services_in_Academic_Libraries_Data_Intensive_Roles_for_the_Future","284029915_Strategies_and_Best_Practices_for_Data_Literacy_Education_Knowledge_Synthesis_Report","282887778_Academic_Libraries_as_Data_Quality_Hubs","279218629_Situating_information_literacy_in_the_disciplines_A_practical_and_systematic_approach_for_academic_librarians","275019628_Thinking_Critically_About_Data_Consumption_Creating_the_Data_Credibility_Checklist","274501948_Incorporating_Data_Literacy_into_Information_Literacy_Programs_Core_Competencies_and_Contents","262489867_Research_data_management_services_in_academic_research_libraries_and_perceptions_of_librarians","262251796_Viewing_information_literacy_concepts_A_comparison_of_two_branches_of_knowledge","261697307_Trust_and_Authority_in_Scholarly_Communications_in_the_Light_of_the_Digital_Transition_Trust_and_Authority_in_Scholarly_Communications_in_the_Light_of_the_Digital_Transition_setting_the_scene_for_a_ma","261347427_Big_Data_Integration","259341007_The_SCONUL_Seven_Pillars_of_Information_Literacy_Core_model","256931935_Spatially_Explicit_Data_Stewardship_and_Ethical_Challenges_in_Science","254296668_Critical_Questions_for_Big_Data","236973378_IT_Governance_How_Top_Performers_Manage_IT_Decision_Rights_for_Superior_Results","220266329_Data_Integration_A_Theoretical_Perspective","353866874_Data_Information_Literacy_Librarians_Data_and_the_Education_of_a_New_Generation_of_Researchers","326073207_The_Challenges_of_Integrating_Data_Literacy_into_the_Curriculum_in_an_Undergraduate_Institution","317915818_Data_management_and_curation_Professional_development_for_librarians_needed","313721126_A_study_of_digital_curator_competences_A_survey_of_experts","310087713_Data_literacy_for_researchers_and_data_librarians","290956868_Facilitating_information_literacy_education_file","289849844_Snapshots_of_informed_learning_LIS_and_beyond","289137205_Visual_management_for_libraries","285629659_'An_intensity_around_information'_The_changing_face_of_chemical_information_literacy","284218214_Competency-based_Curriculum_An_Effective_Approach_to_Digital_Curation_Education","280783226_Librarians_as_partners_in_research_data_service_development_at_Griffith_University","276927464_Planting_the_Seeds_for_Data_Literacy_Lessons_Learned_from_a_Student-Centered_Education_Program","275466783_Where_Does_All_the_Data_Go_Quantifying_the_Final_Disposition_of_Research_Data","272565479_Data_literacy_In_search_of_a_name_and_identity","271991800_Current_Trends_and_Future_Directions_in_Data_Curation_Research_and_Education","264050941_Data_Sharing_and_Discovery_What_Librarians_Need_to_Know","263774940_Research_Information_Literacy_Addressing_Original_Researchers'_Needs","263555977_The_cultivation_of_scientific_data_specialists_Development_of_LIS_education_oriented_to_e-science_service_requirements","259142419_A_study_of_digital_curator_competences_A_survey_of_experts","258134753_A_Systemic_View_of_Implementing_Data_Literacy_in_Educator_Preparation","258129417_Supporting_the_research_process_through_expanded_library_data_services","254948471_Determining_Data_Information_Literacy_Needs_A_Study_of_Students_and_Research_Faculty","240427673_sAccess_The_social_dimension_of_a_new_paradigm_for_academic_librarianship","227699079_Opinion_Whose_role_is_it_anyway_A_library_practitioner's_appraisal_of_the_digital_data_deluge","220426163_Designing_data_governance","47698380_Data_Governance_and_Stewardship_Designing_Data_Stewardship_Entities_and_Advancing_Data_Access"]}
