{"id":"334087728_The_Use_of_Robotics_for_STEM_Education_in_Primary_Schools_Teachers'_Perceptions","abstract":"This study aims to better understand elementary teachers’ perspective on the use of robotics for STEM education. Through an 8-h workshop, the participants engaged in hands-on activities and filled out a pre-survey and a post-survey. The results indicated that the participants’ perceptions significantly changed as a result of participating in the workshop, learning about robotics, and being involved in hands-on robotics activities.","authors":["Ahmad Khanlari"],"meta":["June 2019","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-19913-5_11","In book: Smart Learning with Educational Robotics (pp.267-278)"],"references":["324730311_Implementation_and_Assessment_Methodologies_of_Teachers'_Training_Courses_for_STEM_Activities","283097049_Robotics_to_Promote_Elementary_Education_Pre-service_Teachers'_STEM_Engagement_Learning_and_Teaching","253184479_Investigating_the_impact_of_a_LEGOTM-based_engineering-oriented_curriculum_compared_to_an_inquiry-based_curriculum_on_fifth_graders'_content_learning_of_simple_machines","233121940_Real_and_virtual_robotics_in_mathematics_education_at_the_school-university_transition","229022043_The_Engineers_of_Tomorrow_Teaching_Robotics_to_Primary_School_Children","226696409_Children_robotics_and_education","225205833_Teaching_Partnerships_Early_Childhood_and_Engineering_Students_Teaching_Math_and_Science_Through_Robotics","220797937_RoboCupJunior_Learning_with_Educational_Robotics","3923404_Robotics_learning_as_a_tool_for_integrating_science_technologycurriculum_in_K-12_schools","344833169_Using_Robotics_to_Promote_Learning_in_Elementary_Grades","311313470_Robotics_integration_to_create_an_authentic_learning_environment_in_engineering_education","291036271_Bringing_engineering_to_elementary_school","286049847_Emerging_technologies_ROBOT_assisted_language_learning","281390875_Teachers'_perceptions_of_the_benefits_and_the_challenges_of_integrating_educational_robots_into_primaryelementary_curricula","279656229_Toying_With_Technology_Bridging_the_Gap_Between_Education_and_Engineering","277875840_Exploring_Middle_School_Children's_Problem_Solving_during_Robot_Construction_Tasks","271992251_Impact_of_Robotics_and_Geospatial_Technology_Interventions_on_Youth_STEM_Learning_and_Attitudes","271672066_Robotics_as_Means_to_Increase_Achievement_Scores_in_an_Informal_Learning_Environment","259750193_Robots_Bring_Math-Powered_Ideas_to_Life","257556889_The_Effect_of_a_Classroom-Based_Intensive_Robotics_and_Programming_Workshop_on_Sequencing_Ability_in_Early_Childhood","252557707_Attracting_the_engineers_of_2020_today","247424580_Robots_Exploring_new_technologies_for_learning_for_kids","240273296_Teachers_as_Designers_Integrating_Robotics_in_Early_Childhood_Education","234435732_Developing_career_commitment_in_STEM-related_fields_Myth_versus_reality","228858659_Robotics_education_for_all_ages","220604753_RoboCupJunior_Learning_with_Educational_Robotics","220495993_Does_computer_anxiety_reach_levels_which_conform_to_DSM_IV_criteria_for_specific_phobia","220374731_The_Effect_of_LEGO_Training_on_Pupils'_School_Performance_in_Mathematics_Problem_Solving_Ability_and_Attitude_Swedish_Data","3981464_Using_FIRST_LEGO_League_to_enhance_engineering_education_and_to_increase_the_pool_of_future_engineering_students_work_in_progress"]}
