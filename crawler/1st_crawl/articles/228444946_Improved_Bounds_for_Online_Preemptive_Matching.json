{"id":"228444946_Improved_Bounds_for_Online_Preemptive_Matching","abstract":"When designing a preemptive online algorithm for the maximum matching\nproblem, we wish to maintain a valid matching M while edges of the underlying\ngraph are presented one after the other. When presented with an edge e, the\nalgorithm should decide whether to augment the matching M by adding e (in which\ncase e may be removed later on) or to keep M in its current form without adding\ne (in which case e is lost for good). The objective is to eventually hold a\nmatching M with maximum weight.\nThe main contribution of this paper is to establish new lower and upper\nbounds on the competitive ratio achievable by preemptive online algorithms:\n1. We provide a lower bound of 1+ln 2~1.693 on the competitive ratio of any\nrandomized algorithm for the maximum cardinality matching problem, thus\nimproving on the currently best known bound of e/(e-1)~1.581 due to Karp,\nVazirani, and Vazirani [STOC'90].\n2. We devise a randomized algorithm that achieves an expected competitive\nratio of 5.356 for maximum weight matching. This finding demonstrates the power\nof randomization in this context, showing how to beat the tight bound of 3\n+2\\sqrt{2}~5.828 for deterministic algorithms, obtained by combining the 5.828\nupper bound of McGregor [APPROX'05] and the recent 5.828 lower bound of\nVaradaraja [ICALP'11].","authors":["Leah Epstein","Asaf Levin","Danny Segev","Oren Weimann"],"meta":["July 2012","DOI:10.4230/LIPIcs.STACS.2013.389","SourcearXiv"],"references":["226201045_Weighted_Matching_in_the_Semi-Streaming_Model","220897836_Buyback_Problem_-_Approximate_Matroid_Intersection_with_Cancellation_Costs","220897699_On_Graph_Problems_in_a_Semi-streaming_Model","270308146_759_Euler's_Constant","268642744_Combinatorial_optimization_Polyhedra_and_efficiency_3_volumes","265368048_Data_streams_algorithms_and_applications_Print_version_of_Foundations_and_Trends_in_Theoretical_Computer_Science_Vol_1_No_2_2005","234799140_A_Randomized_Olog2_k-Competitive_Algorithm_for_Metric_Bipartite_Matching","222519034_On_Graph_Problems_in_a_Semi-Streaming_Model","222440240_On-line_algorithms_for_weighted_bipartite_matching_and_stable_marriages","221591759_An_Optimal_Algorithm_for_On-line_Bipartite_Matching","221499002_Probabilistic_Computations_Toward_a_Unified_Measure_of_Complexity_Extended_Abstract","221462683_Finding_Graph_Matchings_in_Data_Streams","220247663_On_Randomization_in_On-Line_Computation","51961449_Linear_Programming_in_the_Semi-streaming_Model_with_Application_to_theMaximum_Matching_Problem","51888543_Laminar_Families_and_Metric_Embeddings_Non-bipartite_Maximum_MatchingProblem_in_the_Semi-Streaming_Model","41218183_Improved_Approximation_Guarantees_for_Weighted_Matching_in_the_Semi-streaming_Model","2702086_Online_Weighted_Matching"]}
