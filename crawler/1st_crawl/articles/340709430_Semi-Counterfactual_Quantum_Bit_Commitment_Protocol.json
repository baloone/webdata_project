{"id":"340709430_Semi-Counterfactual_Quantum_Bit_Commitment_Protocol","abstract":"A semi-counterfactual quantum bit commitment (SCQBC) protocol is presented here for the first time, which makes use of counterfactual property. Similar to a counterfactual quantum key distribution scheme, half-photons are not transmitted through the quantum channel in our proposed protocol. In the SCQBC protocol, Bob, the verification party of the quantum bit commitment (QBC), sends the states while Alice, the commitment party, receives. Since Alice cannot receive all the states and entangle the commit bits with the verifier’s registers, it is not subject to Mayers’ and Lo-Chau’s no-go theorem. In addition, a general bit commitment framework can be extracted from the SCQBC scheme, which opens up a new class of cryptographic protocols in counterfactual cryptography.","authors":["Yaqi Song","Li Yang"],"meta":["April 2020Scientific Reports 10(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-020-62893-0"],"references":["271219036_Practical_quantum_oblivious_transfer_and_bit_commitment_protocols","248702826_On_the_impossibility_of_non-static_quantum_bit_commitment_between_two_parties","241689195_Bit_commitment_protocol_based_on_random_oblivious_transfer_via_quantum_channel","233999839_Experimental_implementation_of_bit_commitment_in_the_noisy-storage_model","331409297_Unconditionally_secure_quantum_bit_commitment_based_on_the_uncertainty_principle","319501489_Unconditionally_secure_quantum_bit_commitment_using_infinite-dimensional_systems","312719122_Unconditionally_Secure_Quantum_Bit_Commitment_Protocol_Based_on_Incomplete_Information","258373329_Unconditional_security_from_noisy_quantum_storage","234516779_Counterfactual_quantum_key_distribution_with_high_efficiency","233947151_Simplified_quantum_bit_commitment_using_single_photon_nonlocality","228109483_WITHDRAWN_Quantum_cryptography_Public_key_distribution_and_coin_tossing","221499660_A_Quantum_Bit_Commitment_Scheme_Provably_Unbreakable_by_both_Parties","231816354_Unconditionally_Secure_Bit_Commitment_by_Transmitting_Measurement_Outcomes","221664399_Practical_Quantum_Bit_Commitment_Protocol","221535468_Coin_Flipping_by_Telephone_-_A_Protocol_for_Solving_Impossible_Problems"]}
