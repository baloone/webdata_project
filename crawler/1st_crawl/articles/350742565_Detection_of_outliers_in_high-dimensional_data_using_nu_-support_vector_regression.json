{"id":"350742565_Detection_of_outliers_in_high-dimensional_data_using_nu_-support_vector_regression","abstract":"Support Vector Regression (SVR) is gaining in popularity in the detection of outliers and classification problems in high-dimensional data (HDD) as this technique does not require the data to be of full rank. In real application, most of the data are of high dimensional. Classification of high-dimensional data is needed in applied sciences, in particular, as it is important to discriminate cancerous cells from non-cancerous cells. It is also imperative that outliers are identified before constructing a model on the relationship between the dependent and independent variables to avoid misleading interpretations about the fitting of a model. The standard SVR and the μ-ε-SVR are able to detect outliers; however, they are computationally expensive. The fixed parameters support vector regression (FP-ε-SVR) was put forward to remedy this issue. However, the FP-ε-SVR using ε-SVR is not very successful in identifying outliers. In this article, we propose an alternative method to detect outliers i.e. by employing nu-SVR. The merit of our proposed method is confirmed by three real examples and the Monte Carlo simulation. The results show that our proposed nu-SVR method is very successful in identifying outliers under a variety of situations, and with less computational running time.","authors":["Abdullah Mohammed Rashid","Habshah Midi","Waleed Dhhan","Jayanthi Arasan"],"meta":["April 2021Journal of Applied Statistics","DOI:10.1080/02664763.2021.1911965"],"references":["303093772_Diagnostic_Robust_Generalized_Potential_Based_on_Index_Set_Equality_DRGP_ISE_for_the_identification_of_high_leverage_points_in_linear_model","273148329_Systematic_Artifacts_in_Support_Vector_Regression-Based_Compound_Potency_Prediction_Revealed_by_Statistical_and_Activity_Landscape_Analysis","257655098_Intelligent_Systems_and_Signal_Processing_in_Power_Engineering","245023623_ROBPCA_A_new_approach_to_robust_principal_component_analysis","243765895_Unmasking_Multivariate_Outliers_and_Leverage_Points","222677269_Robustness_properties_of_a_robust_partial_least_squares_regression_method","221996138_kernlab_-_An_S4_Package_for_Kernel_Methods_in_R","220552601_Weighted_Least_Squares_Support_Vector_Machines_robustness_and_sparse_approximation","41887854_A_robust_support_vector_algorithm_for_nonparametric_spectral_analysis","5844018_Regression_Approaches_for_Microarray_Data_Analysis","5142924_Support_Vector_Machines_in_R","344485142_Robust_Regression_and_Outlier_Detection_RousseeuwRobust_Regression_Outlier_Detection","314168293_Robust_iteratively_reweighted_SIMPLS","305273506_Outlier_detection_in_high-dimensional_regression_model","300566308_Direct_Methods_in_Statistical_Learning_Theory","276910333_Non-sparse_-insensitive_support_vector_regression_for_outlier_detection","276032488_Research_of_Bessel_Kernel_Function_of_the_First_Kind_for_Support_Vector_Regression","257035206_Two_sets_of_near_infrared_spectra","245153707_Multiple_outlier_detection_for_multivariate_calibration_using_robust","236010759_Data_Mining_with_Rattle_and_R_The_Art_of_Excavating_Data_for_Knowledge_Discovery","225228206_Support_vector_regression_with_parameter_tuning_assisted_by_differential_evolution_technique_Study_on_pressure_drop_of_slurry_flow_in_pipeline","224181477_Modified_Support_Vector_Regression_in_outlier_detection","222934004_Facilitating_the_Application_of_Support_Vector_Regression_by_Using_a_Universal_Pearson_VII_Function_Based_Kernel","221619916_Shrinking_the_Tube_A_New_Support_Vector_Regression_Algorithm","209436387_A_Tutorial_on_Support_Vector_Regression","46526990_The_performance_of_diagnostic-robust_generalized_potentials_for_the_identification_of_multiple_high_leverage_points_in_linear_regression","24083583_Identifying_multiple_influential_observations_in_linear_regression","12413257_New_Support_Vector_Algorithms","11207772_Training","4888549_A_New_Measure_of_Overall_Potential_Influence_in_Linear_Regression"]}
