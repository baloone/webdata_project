{"id":"261022687_Time-reversal_against_optimum_precoder_over_frequency-selective_channels","abstract":"A comparison between two optimum precoders for frequency-selective SISO channels under different assumptions on the receiver is drawn. The first design foresees a jointly optimized transceiver (optimum precoder and all-Rake receiver) while the second constrains the receiver to be minimum complex (1-Rake) and consequently uses the optimized precoder, that is, Time-Reversal. Assuming an 802.15.3a channel model, analytical results based on the description of the channel as a single Cox process are proposed for the latter case. Simulations provide performance comparison with the former design showing the maximum precoding gain gap and the minimum Rake complexity required by the optimum precoder for a performance improvement.","authors":["Guido Carlo Ferrante"],"meta":["January 2012","Conference: European Wireless, 2012.
