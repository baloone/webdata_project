{"id":"266584552_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","abstract":"We study and extend the recently introduced total generalized variation (TGV) functional for multichannel images. This functional has already been established to constitute a well-suited convex model for piecewise smooth scalar images. It comprises exactly the functions of bounded variation but is, unlike purely total-variation based functionals, also aware of higher-order smoothness. For the multichannel version which is developed in this paper, basic properties and existence of minimizers for associated variational problems regularized with second-order TGV is shown. Furthermore, we address the design of numerical solution methods for the minimization of functionals with TGV\\(^2\\) penalty and present, in particular, a class of primal-dual algorithms. Finally, the concrete realization for various image processing problems, such as image denoising, deblurring, zooming, dequantization and compressive imaging, are discussed and numerical experiments are presented.","authors":["Kristian Bredies"],"meta":["January 2014","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-54774-4_3"],"references":["253933900_Fast_dual_minimization_of_the_vectorial_total_variation_norm_and_applications_to_color_image_processing","226029783_On_the_Douglas-Rachford_splitting_method_and_the_proximal_point_algorithm_for_maximal_monotone_operators","224136040_An_Algorithm_for_Minimizing_the_Mumford-Shah_Functional","222469583_Nonlinear_total_variation_based_noise_removal_algorithms","221667492_A_Combined_First_and_Second_Order_Variational_Approach_for_Image_Reconstruction","220124444_A_Fast_Algorithm_for_Edge-Preserving_Variational_Multichannel_Image_Restoration","41224935_Optimal_approximation_by_piecewise_smooth_function_and_associated_variational_problems","27290213_Nikolova_M_Local_strong_homogeneity_of_a_regularized_estimator_SIAM_J_Appl_Math_612_633-658","5606906_Noise_removal_using_fourth-order_partial_differential_equation_with_applications_to_medical_magetic_resonace_images_in_space_and_time","3322014_Single-Pixel_Imaging_via_Compressive_Sampling","2098809_The_calibration_method_for_the_Mumford-Shah_functional_and_free-discontinuity_problems","267963604_Artifact-free_JPEG_decompression_with_Total_Generalized_Variation","266067323_Inverse_problems_with_second-order_total_generalized_variation_constraints","265371157_Le_Probleme_de_Dirichlet_pour_les_Equations_Elliptiques_du_Second_Ordre_a_Coefficients_Discontinus","261861198_A_Total_Variation-Based_JPEG_Decompression_Model","254222130_Spatially_dependent_regularization_parameter_selection_in_total_generalized_variation_models_for_image_restoration","250869211_StructuralProperties_of_Solutions_to_Total_Variation_Regularization_Problems","246778021_Mathematical_Problems_in_Plasticity","243654261_Mercier_B_Splitting_algorithms_for_the_sum_of_two_nonlinear_operators_SIAM_J_Numer_Anal_166_964-979","243092619_Monotone_Operators_and_the_Proximal_Point_Algorithm","226456870_Image_recovery_via_total_variation_minimization_and_related_problems","226043052_Variational_Methods_on_the_Space_of_Functions_of_Bounded_Hessian_for_Convexification_and_Denoising","223701467_FE_Image_decomposition_combining_staircase_reduction_and_texture_extraction","220146134_Automated_Regularization_Parameter_Selection_in_Multi-Scale_Total_Variation_Models_for_Image_Restoration","220124409_Total_Generalized_Variation","44241018_A_First-Order_Primal-Dual_Algorithm_for_Convex_Problems_with_Applications_to_Imaging","41700512_Structural_Properties_of_Solutions_to_Total_Variation_Regularization_Problems","2478585_A_Study_in_the_BV_Space_of_a_Denoising-Deblurring_Variational_Problem"]}
