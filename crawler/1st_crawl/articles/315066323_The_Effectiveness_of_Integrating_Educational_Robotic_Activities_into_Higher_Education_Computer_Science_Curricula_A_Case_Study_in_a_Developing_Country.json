{"id":"315066323_The_Effectiveness_of_Integrating_Educational_Robotic_Activities_into_Higher_Education_Computer_Science_Curricula_A_Case_Study_in_a_Developing_Country","abstract":"In this paper, we present a case study to investigate the effects of educational robotics on a formal undergraduate Computer Science education in a developing country. The key contributions of this paper include a longitudinal study design, spanning the whole duration of one taught course, and its focus on continually assessing the effectiveness and the impact of robotic-based exercises. The study assessed the studentsâ€™ motivation, engagement and level of understanding in learning general computer programming. The survey results indicate that there are benefits which can be gained from such activities and educational robotics is a promising tool in developing engaging study curricula. We hope that our experience from this study together with the free materials and data available for download will be beneficial to other practitioners working with educational robotics in different parts of the world.","authors":["Ernest Gyebi","Marc Hanheide","Grzegorz Cielniak"],"meta":["March 2017Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing 560:73-87","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-55553-9_6","Conference: International Conference EduRobotics 2016"],"references":["258792931_Integrating_Mobile_Robotics_and_Vision_With_Undergraduate_Computer_Science","240825099_Teaching_technical_creativity_through_Robotics_A_case_study_in_Ghana","315081018_Crisis_in_mathematics_education_Student_failure_challenges_and_possibilities","291036271_Bringing_engineering_to_elementary_school","278417352_Teaching_CS1_with_Karel_the_Robot_in_Java","271672066_Robotics_as_Means_to_Increase_Achievement_Scores_in_an_Informal_Learning_Environment","268525463_Educational_Robotics_of_low_cost_applied_to_Physics_Teaching_in_Brazil","268045046_School_Context_Student_Attitudes_and_Behavior_and_Academic_Achievement_An_Exploratory_Analysis","260941291_Robotics_for_computer_scientists_what's_the_big_idea","248933239_Affirmative_action_gender_equity_and_university_admissions_-_Kenya_Uganda_and_Tanzania"]}
