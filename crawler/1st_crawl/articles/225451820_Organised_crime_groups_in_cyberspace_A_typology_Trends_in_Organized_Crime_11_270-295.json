{"id":"225451820_Organised_crime_groups_in_cyberspace_A_typology_Trends_in_Organized_Crime_11_270-295","abstract":"Three categories of organised groups that exploit advances in information and communications technologies (ICT) to infringe\nlegal and regulatory controls: (1) traditional organised criminal groups which make use of ICT to enhance their terrestrial\ncriminal activities; (2) organised cybercriminal groups which operate exclusively online; and (3) organised groups of ideologically\nand politically motivated individuals who make use of ICT to facilitate their criminal conduct are described in this article.\nThe need for law enforcement to have in-depth knowledge of computer forensic principles, guidelines, procedures, tools, and\ntechniques, as well as anti-forensic tools and techniques will become more pronounced with the increased likelihood of digital\ncontent being a source of disputes or forming part of underlying evidence to support or refute a dispute in judicial proceedings.\nThere is also a need for new strategies of response and further research on analysing organised criminal activities in cyberspace.","authors":["Kim-Kwang Raymond Choo"],"meta":["September 2008Trends in Organized Crime 11(3):270-295","DOI:10.1007/s12117-008-9038-9"],"references":["249685475_Cyberspace_and_Child_Abuse_ImagesA_Feminist_Perspective","228198960_Organized_Cybercrime_How_Cyberspace_May_Affect_the_Structure_of_Criminal_Relationships","227032420_Money_Laundering_and_Terrorism_Financing_Risks_of_Prepaid_Cards_Instruments","225258935_Studying_Malicious_Websites_and_the_Underground_Economy_on_the_Chinese_Web","221352717_File_System_Journal_Forensics","3437766_The_simple_economics_of_cybercrimes","288961840_Battling_botnets_and_online_mobs_Estonia's_defense_efforts_during_the_internet_war","257546846_Whose_computer_is_it_anyway_part_II","250805027_Her_Majesty's_Secret_Service","250759837_How_to_leak_a_secret_and_not_get_caught","250726578_Al_Qaeda_buys_cyber_criminal_expertise","249035933_The_Hofstad_Group_The_New_Face_of_Terrorist_Networks_in_Europe","248982687_Virtual_Disputes_The_Use_of_the_Internet_for_Terrorist_Debates","248067931_The_Zombie_Roundup_Understanding_Detecting_and_Disrupting_Botnets","246970310_Criminal_Exploitation_of_Online_Systems_by_Organised_Crime_Groups","245588653_Botnets_as_a_Vehicle_for_Online_Crime","243784811_CSIFBI_Computer_Crime_and_Security_Survey","241075429_South_Asian_Organized_Crime_and_Terrorist_Networks","235270686_The_risks_to_business_presented_by_organised_and_economically_motivated_criminal_enterprises","233466426_Criminal_histories_An_introduction","227530650_Hate_Online_A_Content_Analysis_of_Extremist_Internet_Sites","226852363_The_prosecution_of_Chinese_organized_crime_groups_The_Sister_Ping_case_and_its_lessons","226141887_Cyberstalking_and_Internet_Pornography_Gender_and_the_Gaze","225811465_Requirements_of_prosecution_services_to_deal_with_cyber_crime","225333571_Transnational_organised_cyber_crime_Distinguishing_threat_from_reality","222422774_Pattern_of_global_cyber_war_and_crime_A_conceptual_framework","221609007_An_inquiry_into_the_nature_and_causes_of_the_wealth_of_internet_miscreants","221352749_Survey_of_Law_Enforcement_Perceptions_Regarding_Digital_Evidence","220988243_Cybercrime_in_Taiwan_-_An_Analysis_of_Suspect_Records","220615579_Organized_Crime_Goes_Cyber","220542555_Error_Uncertainty_and_Loss_in_Digital_Evidence","3437982_The_New_Front_Line_Estonia_under_Cyberassault","3437795_Silver_Bullet_Speaks_to_Avi_Rubin"]}
