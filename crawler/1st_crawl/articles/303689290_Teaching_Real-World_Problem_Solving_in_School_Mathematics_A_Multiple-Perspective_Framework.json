{"id":"303689290_Teaching_Real-World_Problem_Solving_in_School_Mathematics_A_Multiple-Perspective_Framework","abstract":"In the last 50 years, certain paradigm shifts have taken place in the conception of teaching. These shifts tended to broaden the conception of teaching from a focus on teaching of subject matter (Shulman, 1970), to a focus on contextual learning and teaching in the larger socioeconomic context of the school (UNESCO, 2004), to a focus on social production and reproduction of teaching and learning (Lerman, 2006). The shifts in the conception of teaching have reflected themselves in the roles of the teacher and learner, the meaning of the subject matter, the object of teaching, the role of social, economic, and cultural factors in shaping, and being shaped, by teaching and learning.","authors":["Murad E.
