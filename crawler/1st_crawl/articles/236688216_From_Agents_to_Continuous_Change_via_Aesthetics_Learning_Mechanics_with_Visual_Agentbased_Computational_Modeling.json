{"id":"236688216_From_Agents_to_Continuous_Change_via_Aesthetics_Learning_Mechanics_with_Visual_Agentbased_Computational_Modeling","abstract":"Novice learners find motion as a continuous process of change challenging to\nunderstand. In this paper, we present a pedagogical approach based on\nagent-based, visual programming to address this issue. Integrating Logo\nprogramming with curricular science has been shown to be challenging in\nprevious research on educational computing. We present a new Logo-based visual\nprogramming language - ViMAP - and, a sequence of learning activities involving\nprogramming and modeling, designed specifically to support seamless integration\nbetween programming and learning kinematics. We describe relevant affordances\nof the ViMAP environment that supports such seamless integration. We then\npresent ViMAP-MoMo, a curricular unit designed in ViMAP for modeling\nkinematics, for a wide range of students (elementary - high school). The main\ncontribution of this paper is that we describe in detail a sequence of learning\nactivities in three phases, discuss the underlying rationale for each phase,\nand where relevant, report results in the form of observational data from two\nstudies.","authors":["Pratim Sengupta","Amy Voss Farris","Mason Wright"],"meta":["May 2013Technology, Knowledge, and Learning 17(1-2)","DOI:10.1007/s10758-012-9190-9","SourcearXiv","Project: Computational Thinking and Modeling in K12 STEM"],"references":["258944205_The_Initial_Knowledge_State_of_College_Physics_Students","255575066_MODELING_is_the_name_of_the_game","304898664_Envisioning_Information","290055214_Pervasive_fabrication_Making_construction_ubiquitous_in_education","269948123_Envisioning_Information","269496157_Envisioning_Information","261191492_Envisioning_Information","258962858_Student_difficulties_in_connecting_graphs_and_physics_Examples_from_kinematics","249797836_Functions_Graphs_and_Graphing_Tasks_Learning_and_Teaching","246091735_Pandora's_Hope_Essays_on_the_Reality_of_Science_Studies"]}
