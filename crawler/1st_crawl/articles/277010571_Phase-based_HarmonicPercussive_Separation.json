{"id":"277010571_Phase-based_HarmonicPercussive_Separation","abstract":"In this paper, a method for separation of harmonic and percussive elements in music recordings is presented. The proposed method is based on a simple spectral peak detection step followed by a phase expectation analysis that discriminates between harmonic and percussive components. The proposed\nmethod was tested on a database of 10 audio tracks and has shown superior results to the reference state-of-the-art approach.","authors":["Estefan√≠a Cano","Mark D.
