{"id":"326754782_The_flipped_classroom_A_review_of_its_advantages_and_challenges","abstract":"This study presents a large-scale systematic review of the literature on the flipped classroom, with the goals of examining its reported advantages and challenges for both students and instructors, and to note potentially useful areas of future research on the flipped model's in and out-of-class activities. The full range of Social Sciences Citation Indexed journals was surveyed through the Web of Science site, and a total of 71 research articles were selected for the review. The findings reveal that the most frequently reported advantage of the flipped classroom is the improvement of student learning performance. We also found a number of challenges in this model. The majority of these are related to out-of-class activities, such as much reported inadequate student preparation prior to class. Several other challenges and the numerous advantages of the flipped classroom are discussed in detail. We then offer suggestions for future research on flipped model activities.","authors":["Gokce Akcayir","Murat Akçayır"],"meta":["August 2018Computers & Education 126","DOI:10.1016/j.compedu.2018.07.021"],"references":["312147615_A_critical_review_of_flipped_classroom_challenges_in_K-12_education_Possible_solutions_and_recommendations_for_future_research"]}
