{"id":"322781740_Adiabatic_quantum_computation","abstract":"Adiabatic quantum computing (AQC) started as an approach to solving optimization problems and has evolved into an important universal alternative to the standard circuit model of quantum computing, with deep connections to both classical and quantum complexity theory and condensed matter physics. This review gives an account of the major theoretical developments in the field, while focusing on the closed-system setting. The review is organized around a series of topics that are essential to an understanding of the underlying principles of AQC, its algorithmic accomplishments and limitations, and its scope in the more general setting of computational complexity theory. Several variants are presented of the adiabatic theorem, the cornerstone of AQC, and examples are given of explicit AQC algorithms that exhibit a quantum speedup. An overview of several proofs of the universality of AQC and related Hamiltonian quantum complexity theory is given. Considerable space is devoted to stoquastic AQC, the setting of most AQC work to date, where obstructions to success and their possible resolutions are discussed.","authors":["Tameem Albash","Daniel Lidar"],"meta":["January 2018Review of Modern Physics 90(1)","DOI:10.1103/RevModPhys.90.015002"],"references":["312157431_The_Fair_in_Unfair_Quantum_Ground-State_Sampling","305924508_Zero-temperature_quantum_annealing_bottlenecks_in_the_spin-glass_phase","305229061_Adiabatic_optimization_versus_diffusion_Monte_Carlo","303752329_Generalized_Ramsey_numbers_through_adiabatic_quantum_optimization","301875608_Strengths_and_Weaknesses_of_Weak-Strong_Cluster_Problems_A_Detailed_Overview_of_State-of-the-art_Classical_Heuristics_vs_Quantum_Approaches","289584806_Computational_multiqubit_tunnelling_in_programmable_quantum_annealers","286301759_What_is_the_Computational_Value_of_Finite_Range_Tunneling","283761525_Tunneling_and_Speedup_in_Quantum_Optimization_for_Permutation-Symmetric_Problems","283335335_Understanding_Quantum_Tunneling_through_Quantum_Monte_Carlo_Simulations","282790373_Bifurcation-based_adiabatic_quantum_computation_with_a_nonlinear_oscillator_network_Toward_quantum_soft_computing","281576728_Adiabatic_and_Hamiltonian_computing_on_a_2D_lattice_with_simple_2-qubit_interactions","281262389_Adiabaticity_in_open_quantum_systems","278332528_Optimal_protocols_for_driven_quantum_systems","268987904_Probing_Entanglement_in_Adiabatic_Quantum_Optimization_with_Trapped_Ions","268689598_Quantum_annealing_The_fastest_route_to_quantum_computation","266477930_On_Complexity_of_the_Quantum_Ising_Model","266262235_Universal_Adiabatic_Quantum_Computation_via_the_Space-Time_Circuit-to-Hamiltonian_Construction","266147283_Quantum_versus_Classical_Annealing_Insights_from_Scaling_Theory_and_Results_for_Spin_Glasses_on_3-Regular_Graphs","263967953_Bayesian_Network_Structure_Learning_Using_Quantum_Annealing","262381348_Quantum_Annealing_search_of_Ising_spin_glass_ground_states_with_tunable_transverse_longitudinal_fields","311737108_Realizable_quantum_adiabatic_search","309766414_Necessary_Adiabatic_Run_Times_in_Quantum_Optimization","309753431_Supercritical_entanglement_in_local_systems_Counterexample_to_the_area_law_for_quantum_matter","309143450_Asymptotically_optimal_probes_for_noisy_interferometry_via_quantum_annealing_to_criticality","308409691_Non-Stoquastic_Hamiltonians_and_Quantum_Annealing_of_Ising_Spin_Glass","306029593_Estimation_of_effective_temperatures_in_quantum_annealers_for_sampling_applications_A_case_study_with_possible_applications_in_deep_learning","304351834_Exponentially-Biased_Ground-State_Sampling_of_Quantum_Annealing_Machines_with_Transverse-Field_Driving_Hamiltonians","303779168_Solving_the_Optimal_Trading_Trajectory_Problem_Using_a_Quantum_Annealer","303754161_COMPLEXITY_CLASSIFICATION_OF_LOCAL_HAMILTONIAN_PROBLEMS","290028756_Spectral_Gap_Analysis_for_Efficient_Tunneling_in_Quantum_Adiabatic_Optimization","284200009_Simulated_quantum_annealing_of_double-well_and_multiwell_potentials","281670855_Quantum_Monte_Carlo_Simulations_of_Tunneling_in_Quantum_Adiabatic_Optimization","280969894_Singular-value_decomposition_using_quantum_annealing","280821144_Polynomial-Time_Algorithms_for_Prime_Factorization_and_Discrete_Logarithms_on_a_Quantum_Computer","277966173_A_polynomial_time_algorithm_for_the_ground_state_of_one-dimensional_gapped_local_Hamiltonians","277614392_Read_the_fine_print","275836517_Schedule_path_optimization_for_quantum_annealing_and_adiabatic_quantum_computing","274176214_Ground-state_statistics_from_annealing_algorithms_Quantum_versus_classical_approaches","273594342_On_the_Adiabatic_Theorem_of_Quantum_Mechanics","272860727_Matrix_Analysis","271722059_Hamiltonian_gadgets_with_reduced_resource_requirements","271218203_Efficient_Cluster_Algorithm_for_Spin_Glasses_in_Any_Space_Dimension","268306657_Proof_of_the_Landau-Zener_formula","267001092_Entanglement_properties_of_adiabatic_quantum_algorithms","266992571_Multicore_Parallel_programming","266517844_Statistical_Physics_of_Spin_Glasses_and_Information_Processing-An_Introduction","266396683_Quantum_Annealing_with_Antiferromagnetic_Transverse_Interactions_for_the_Hopfield_Model","265460434_Geometry_Topology_and_Physics","264623866_From_local_to_global_ground_states_in_Ising_spin_glasses","263902477_ENTANGLEMENT_IN_ADIABATIC_QUANTUM_SEARCHING_ALGORITHMS","261366591_Graph_Isomorphism_and_Adiabatic_Quantum_Computing","259844763_Architectural_Considerations_in_the_Design_of_a_Superconducting_Quantum_Annealing_Processor","259764801_Quantum_Hamiltonian_Complexity","259695449_Quantum_computing_Defining_and_detecting_quantum_speedup","258849352_Space-Time_Circuit-to-Hamiltonian_Construction_and_Its_Applications"]}
