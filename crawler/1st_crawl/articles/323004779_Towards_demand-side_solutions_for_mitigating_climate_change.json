{"id":"323004779_Towards_demand-side_solutions_for_mitigating_climate_change","abstract":"Research on climate change mitigation tends to focus on supply-side technology solutions. A better understanding of demand-side solutions is missing. We propose a transdisciplinary approach to identify demand-side climate solutions, investigate their mitigation potential, detail policy measures, and assess their implications for well-being.","authors":["Felix Creutzig","Joyashree Roy","William F.
