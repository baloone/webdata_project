{"id":"342412931_RESEARCH_TRENDS_IN_SOFTWARE_ENGINEERING_FIELD_A_LITERATURE_REVIEW","abstract":"ABSTRACT\nSoftware engineering is one of computer science branches, it \ncomprises of building and developing software systems and applications. \nSoftware engineering is a discipline that has a constant growth in research \nin aim to identify new technologies and adopt it in different areas; there is \na considerable investment on software engineering trends at the current \ntime due to the availability of mobile technologies. With millions of billions \nof smart devices that are connected to the internet, all industries around \nthe world are rapidly becoming a technology driven industries.\nSoftware engineers are aware of programming languages that are \nemployed to develop software systems, by applying engineering principles \nto development process; they can design customized software systems for \nindividual or organizational customers. The new trends in software \nengineering are numerous, Cloud Computing, machine learning, deep \nlearning, big Data, mobile Computing. Nevertheless, there are many more \nother research trends in software engineering's field that have been \nintensively explored and implemented in many different industries. In this \npaper, authors try to summarize the most fields that are integrated with \nsoftware engineering recently.","authors":["Hiba Alsghaier"],"meta":["June 2020International Journal of Engineering Technologies and Management Research 7(6)","DOI:10.29121/ijetmr.v7.i6.2020.694"],"references":["344579687_The_COVID-19_Pandemic_When_E-Learning_Becomes_Mandatory_Not_Complementary","340777551_Test_Suites_Effectiveness_Evolution_in_Open_Source_Systems_Empirical_Study","340391233_The_Influence_of_Deep_Learning_Algorithms_Factors_in_Software_Fault_Prediction","339977068_Enterprise_Resource_Planning_Quality_Model_ERPQM","339953724_Evolutionary_neural_network_classifiers_for_software_effort_estimation","339434973_The_effectiveness_of_using_deep_learning_algorithms_in_predicting_students_achievements","338848014_Software_fault_prediction_using_particle_swarm_algorithm_with_genetic_algorithm_and_support_vector_machine_classifier","338711859_published","337300141_Software_Fault_Prediction_Using_Deep_Learning_Algorithms","341758306_Evolutionary_neural_network_classifiers_for_software_effort_estimation","337184687_The_Impact_of_Co-evolution_of_Code_Production_and_Test_Suites_through_Software_Releases_in_Open_Source_Software_Systems","328943933_Game_Based_Learning_Approach_to_Improve_Self-Learning_Motivated_Students","328245659_Test_Case_Minimization_using_Genetic_Algorithm_Pilot_Study","327838191_An_efficient_approach_for_test_suite_reduction_using_K-means_clustering","331376783_Exploring_Nesting_Levels_in_Evolving_Open_Source_Software_Systems_Experimental_Study"]}
