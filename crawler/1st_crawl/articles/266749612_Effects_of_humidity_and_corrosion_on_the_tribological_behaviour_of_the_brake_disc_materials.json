{"id":"266749612_Effects_of_humidity_and_corrosion_on_the_tribological_behaviour_of_the_brake_disc_materials","abstract":"The aim of the present work was to investigate the influence of humidity and corrosion in a high-salinity environment on the friction and wear behaviour of three brake disc materials. Experiments were conducted using a commercially built disc-on-pin machine (SRV4, Optimal Instruments, Germany). Three different disc brake materials were used: cast iron (type FG25), chromium bearing steel (type 100Cr6) and an aluminium-based composite Al MMC (type A359/SiCp). The pin in all tests was a commercial automotive brake pad material. The results showed that the friction coefficients and the wear rate for all tested materials were sensitive to increasing normal load and the sliding speed. At increased humidity level, a water film formed and behaved as a lubricant. The corrosion due to salt spray had a larger influence on the tribological behaviour of the cast iron and the chromium steel than it did on the Al MMC. The Al MMC A359/SiCp exhibited a better tribological behaviour than the other brake disc materials used in this investigation under the given test conditions.","authors":["M.
