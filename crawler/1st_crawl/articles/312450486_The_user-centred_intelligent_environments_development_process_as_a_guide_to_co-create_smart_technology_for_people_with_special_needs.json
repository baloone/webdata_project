{"id":"312450486_The_user-centred_intelligent_environments_development_process_as_a_guide_to_co-create_smart_technology_for_people_with_special_needs","abstract":"This paper reports on the lessons learnt during the application of a methodology to develop intelligent environments. One important feature of the methodology is that of being strongly user-centred, and the authors report on how that interaction with users took place and how it continuously shaped our project aspirations and out comes.The methodology was applied to a project which aimed at helping people with Downâ€™s Syndrome and those with similar conditions and needs, to be more included in society. The project was developed by a consortium of commercial, academic, and end user supporting organizations. The paper elaborates on what type of stakeholders engaging activities were considered and how these were distributed along the lifetime of the project and their impact.","authors":["Juan Carlos Augusto Wrede","Dean Kramer","Unai Alegre","Alexandra Covaci"],"meta":["March 2018Universal Access in the Information Society 17(1):1-16","DOI:10.1007/s10209-016-0514-8","Project: POSEIDON"],"references":["295894903_Engineering_Context-Aware_Systems_and_Applications_A_survey","286680043_User-Centric_Software_Development_Process","282104797_Assessing_Real_World_Imagery_in_Virtual_Environments_for_People_with_Cognitive_Disabilities","281373205_Developing_Navigational_Services_for_People_with_Down's_Syndrome","274347479_Designing_for_User_Confidence_in_Intelligent_Environments","270793368_Intelligent_Environments_a_manifesto","269520849_E_FRIEND_An_ethical_framework_for_intelligent_environment_development","313730983_The_computer_for_the_21st_century","295261662_Personalized_Smart_Environments_to_Increase_Inclusion_of_People_with_Down's_Syndrome","268820960_143_System_of_Systems_Pain_Points"]}
