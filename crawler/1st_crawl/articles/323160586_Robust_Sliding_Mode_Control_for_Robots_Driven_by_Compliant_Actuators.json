{"id":"323160586_Robust_Sliding_Mode_Control_for_Robots_Driven_by_Compliant_Actuators","abstract":"Compliant actuators can offer many attractive features over stiff actuators in real human-robot interaction applications, such as low output impedance, smooth force transmission, and shock tolerance. This brief focuses on a robust sliding mode control (SMC) methodology for robotic systems with compliant actuators. First, a continuous SMC design is introduced due to its advantages of strong robustness and chattering attenuation. However, this continuous SMC structure cannot guarantee a high tracking performance in the presence of mismatched disturbances in compliantly actuated robots. Meanwhile, in many application fields, compliantly actuated robots are affected by different kinds of time-varying disturbances, including external environmental disturbances, internal parameter uncertainties, and frictions, which may be in the form of constant, ramp, and parabolic disturbances. To estimate such unknown disturbances, a generalized proportional integral observer (GPIO) technique is employed. By designing a new sliding surface with the help of disturbance estimation, a GPIO-based continuous SMC method is synthesized, which is used to deal with matched/mismatched time-varying disturbances. A detailed stability analysis of the closed-loop system is also presented. Experimental results under three different test conditions are provided to illustrate the promising tracking performance of the proposed control strategy.","authors":["Huiming Wang","Yongping Pan","Shihua Li","Haoyong Yu"],"meta":["February 2018Control Systems Technology, IEEE Transactions on PP(99):1-8","DOI:10.1109/TCST.2018.2799587"],"references":["311623147_Adaptive_Human-Robot_Interaction_Control_for_Robots_Driven_by_Series_Elastic_Actuators","304341006_Continuous_Tracking_Control_for_a_Compliant_Actuator_With_Two-Stage_Stiffness","299499594_GPIO-Based_Robust_Control_of_Nonlinear_Uncertain_Systems_under_Time-Varying_Disturbance_with_Application_to_DC-DC_Converter","280066119_Robust_Constrained_Control_for_MIMO_Nonlinear_Systems_Based_on_Disturbance_Observer","265645738_Piezoelectric_Multimode_Vibration_Control_for_Stiffened_Plate_Using_ADRC-Based_Acceleration_Compensation","263128569_Dual-Stage_Iterative_Learning_Control_for_MIMO_Mismatched_System_With_Application_to_Robots_With_Joint_Elasticity","262881737_Dynamic_Modeling_and_Control_of_Parallel_Robots_With_Elastic_Cables_Singular_Perturbation_Approach","260913228_Chattering_free_full-order_sliding-mode_control","260707653_Active_Disturbance_Rejection_Control_Based_on_an_Improved_Equivalent-Input-Disturbance_Approach","260522056_Design_of_a_Disturbance_Observer_for_a_Two-Link_Manipulator_With_Flexible_Joints","260509866_On_the_Robust_Control_of_Buck-Converter_DC-Motor_Combinations","259929998_On_the_Control_of_the_Permanent_Magnet_Synchronous_Motor_An_Active_Disturbance_Rejection_Control_Approach","259137893_Control_design_of_a_novel_compliant_actuator_for_rehabilitation_robots","256446093_Robots_Driven_by_Compliant_Actuators_Optimal_Control_Under_Actuation_Constraints","254017701_Sliding-Mode_Control_for_Systems_With_Mismatched_Uncertainties_via_a_Disturbance_Observer","230872857_Flatness_and_defect_of_non-linear_systems_introductory_theory_and_examples","224587361_Compliant_actuator_designs","224112846_Integral_Resonant_Control_for_Vibration_Damping_and_Precise_Tip-Positioning_of_a_Single-Link_Flexible_Manipulator","4077024_The_RoboKnee_An_exoskeleton_for_enhancing_strength_and_endurance_during_walking","325506697_Continuous_sliding_mode_control_of_compliant_robot_arms_A_singularly_perturbed_approach","322279042_Efficient_PID_Tracking_Control_of_Robotic_Manipulators_Driven_by_Compliant_Actuators","320341641_Integral_Sliding_Mode_Control_Performance_Modification_and_Improvement","317374475_Adaptive_Command-Filtered_Backstepping_Control_of_Robot_Arms_With_Compliant_Actuators","316023190_Continuous_Output_Feedback_TSM_Control_for_Uncertain_Systems_with_a_DC-AC_Inverter_Example","313179418_From_PID_to_active_disturbance_rejection_control","306147313_Continuous_Sliding_Mode_Control_for_Permanent_Magnet_Synchronous_Motor_Speed_Regulation_Systems_Under_Time-Varying_Disturbances","282404006_Human-Robot_Interaction_Control_of_Rehabilitation_Robots_With_Series_Elastic_Actuators","278743679_Control_of_uncertain_nonlinear_systems_based_on_observers_and_estimators","276082527_Backstepping_Control_of_Variable_Stiffness_Robots","275236751_Finite-Time_Stabilization_for_Vehicle_Active_Suspension_Systems_With_Hard_Constraints","262492586_Active_Disturbance_Rejection_Control_Applied_To_A_Delta_Parallel_Robot_In_Trajectory_Tracking_Tasks","261636760_Disturbance-Observer-Based_Sliding-Mode_Control_for_a_3-DOF_Nanopositioning_Stage","224998292_A_Unified_Passivity_Based_Control_Framework_for_Position_Torque_and_Impedance_Control_of_Flexible_Joint_Robots","224580716_Extended-State-Observer-Based_Control_of_Flexible-Joint_System_With_Experimental_Validation","220121883_Comparison_of_Mechanical_Design_and_Energy_Consumption_of_Adaptable_Passive-compliant_Actuators","24193712_Constrained_incremental_predictive_controller_design_for_a_flexible_joint_robot","3332584_Adaptive_Sliding_Control_for_Single-Link_Flexible-Joint_Robot_With_Mismatched_Uncertainties","3218873_Adaptive_Control_for_Flexible-Joint_Electrically_Driven_Robot_With_Time-Varying_Uncertainties"]}
