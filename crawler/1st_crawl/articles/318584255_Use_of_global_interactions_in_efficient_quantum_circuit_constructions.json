{"id":"318584255_Use_of_global_interactions_in_efficient_quantum_circuit_constructions","abstract":"In this paper we study the ways to use a global entangling operator to efficiently implement circuitry common to a selection of important quantum algorithms. In particular, we focus on the circuits composed with global Ising entangling gates and arbitrary addressable single-qubit gates. We show that under various circumstances the use of global operations can substantially improve the entangling gate count. Â© 2018 The Author(s).
