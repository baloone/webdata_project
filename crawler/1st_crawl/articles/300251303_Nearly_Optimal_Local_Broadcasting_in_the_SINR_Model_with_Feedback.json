{"id":"300251303_Nearly_Optimal_Local_Broadcasting_in_the_SINR_Model_with_Feedback","abstract":"We consider the SINR wireless model with uniform power. In this model the success of a transmission is determined by the ratio between the strength of the transmission signal and the noise produced by other transmitting processors plus ambient noise. The local broadcasting problem is a fundamental problem in this setting. Its goal is producing a schedule in which each processor successfully transmits a message to all its neighbors. This problem has been studied in various variants of the setting, where the best currently-known algorithm has running time \\(O(\\bar{\\Delta} + \\log^2 n)\\) in n-node networks with feedback, where \\(\\bar{\\Delta}\\) is the maximum neighborhood size [9]. In the latter setting processors receive free feedback on a successful transmission. We improve this result by devising a local broadcasting algorithm with time \\(O(\\bar{\\Delta} + \\log n \\log \\log n)\\) in networks with feedback. Our result is nearly tight in view of the lower bounds \\(\\Omega(\\bar{\\Delta})\\) and Î©(logn) [13]. Our results also show that the conjecture that \\(\\Omega(\\bar{\\Delta} + \\log^2 n)\\) time is required for local broadcasting [9] is not true in some settings.","authors":["Leonid Barenboim","David Peleg"],"meta":["July 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-25258-2_12","Conference: International Colloquium on Structural Information and Communication Complexity"],"references":["304608977_The_Locality_of_Distributed_Symmetry_Breaking","267438087_Distributed_Graph_Coloring_Fundamentals_and_Recent_Developments","254042848_An_Olog_n_Distributed_Approximation_Algorithm_for_Local_Broadcasting_in_Unstructured_Wireless_Networks","228445077_Towards_Tight_Bounds_for_Local_Broadcasting","228102764_Distributed_Backbone_Structure_for_Algorithms_in_the_SINR_Model_of_Wireless_Networks","224253137_Distributed_local_broadcasting_algorithms_in_the_physical_interference_model","221662908_The_Locality_of_Distributed_Symmetry_Breaking","221459002_Distributed_Node_Coloring_in_the_SINR_Model","221406546_Local_Broadcasting_in_the_Physical_Interference_Model","221344208_Coloring_Unstructured_Wireless_Multi-Hop_Networks","221343985_A_Log-Star_Distributed_Maximal_Independent_Set_Algorithm_for_Growth-Bounded_Graphs","299669336_On_Local_Broadcasting_Schedules_and_CONGEST_Algorithms_in_the_SINR_Model","273186751_Efficiency_of_Wireless_Networks_Approximation_Algorithms_for_the_Physical_Interference_Model","272195328_Simple_Distributed_Delta_1_Coloring_in_the_SINR_Model","265505153_Local_Broadcasting_with_Arbitrary_Transmission_Power_in_the_SINR_Model"]}
