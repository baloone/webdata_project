{"id":"335296079_Regulating_Blockchain_Techno-Social_and_Legal_Challenges-An_Introduction","abstract":"This introductory chapter provides an overview of the main legal and policy implications of blockchain technology. It proceeds in four steps. First, the chapter traces the technical and legal evolution of blockchain applications since the early days of Bitcoin, highlighting in particular the political ambitions and tensions that have marked many of these projects from the start. Second, it shows how blockchain applications have created new calculative spaces of financial markets that seek to challenge existing forms of money. Third, it discusses the core points of friction with incumbent legal systems, with a particular focus on the regulability of decentralized systems in general and data protection concerns in particular. Fourth, the chapter provides an outline to the contributions to the volume, which span a wide array of topics at the intersection of blockchain, law, and politics.","authors":["Philipp Hacker","Ioannis Lianos","Georgios Dimitropoulos","Stefan Eich"],"meta":["June 2019","DOI:10.1093/oso/9780198842187.003.0001","In book: Regulating Blockchain (pp.1-24)","Project: Blockchain and Cryptoasset Regulation"],"references":["309574531_The_invisible_politics_of_Bitcoin_governance_crisis_of_a_decentralised_infrastructure","331526065_Regulation_by_Blockchain_the_Emerging_Battle_for_Supremacy_between_the_Code_of_Law_and_Code_as_Law","321933130_Distributed_Ledger_Joint_Control_-_Blockchains_and_the_GDPR's_Transparency_Requirements","321640109_Crypto-Securities_Regulation_ICOs_Token_Sales_and_Cryptocurrencies_under_EU_Financial_Law","320481617_Blockchain-Based_Token_Sales_Initial_Coin_Offerings_and_the_Democratization_of_Public_Capital_Markets","319383275_Digital_Technology_as_a_Challenge_to_European_Contract_Law","317996432_Blockchain's_Struggle_to_Deliver_Impersonal_Exchange","306304642_Hawk_The_Blockchain_Model_of_Cryptography_and_Privacy-Preserving_Smart_Contracts","302919497_Blockchains_and_Smart_Contracts_for_the_Internet_of_Things","265569192_LAW_OF_THE_INTERMEDIATED_INFORMATION_EXCHANGE"]}
