{"id":"315096448_The_Collaborative_Virtual_Affinity_Group_Model_Principles_and_Design","abstract":"The problem addressed in this paper is the challenge arising in enabling collaborative learning in the context distance education models. While research has made quantum leaps in the development of both effective collaborative pedagogical models as well as online learning environments, the research at the intersection of these two areas has been scarce. This paper presents the design for a new collaborative virtual model, named Collaborative Virtual Affinity Group model (CVAG), which is an extension of the successful Affinity Group Research (ARG) model. The new model provides an integration of the principles underlying ARG with the traditional principles of virtual learning environments. The CVAG model is explored in the context of introductory Computer Science courses|where students are focused on learning the basic principles of computer programming.","authors":["Ahmad Al-Jarrah","Enrico Pontelli","Clinton Jeffery"],"meta":["March 2017","Project: COLLABORATIVE VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENTS FOR INTRODUCTORY PROGRAMMING (CVEIP)"],"references":["282680409_AliCe-ViLlagE_Alice_as_a_Collaborative_Virtual_Learning_Environment","321610957_Collaborative_Virtual_Environments_Digital_Places_and_Spaces_for_Interaction","321609970_Computer_Supported_Collaborative_Learning","317953561_Mind_in_society_The_development_of_higher_psychological_processes","302558403_Collaboration_scripts_in_computer-supported_collaborative_learning","266866237_Collaborative_Virtual_Environments_in_education","264301531_Expanding_Participation_in_Undergraduate_Research_Using_the_Affinity_Group_Model","246133801_Expanding_participation_in_undergraduate_research_using_the_affinity_group_model","245686604_Collaborative_Learning_Techniques_A_Handbook_for_College_Faculty","245589136_Bridging_Differences_Effective_Intergroup_Communication","243764412_Research_With_Hispanic_Populations","240223485_Cooperation_in_the_Classroom","239064052_Collaborative_Virtual_Environments_tutorial_6","239062196_Learning_to_Program_with_Alice_Prentice-Hall","238701696_Collaborative_virtual_environments_Digital_places_and_spaces_for_interaction"]}
