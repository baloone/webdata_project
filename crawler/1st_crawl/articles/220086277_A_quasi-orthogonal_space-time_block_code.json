{"id":"220086277_A_quasi-orthogonal_space-time_block_code","abstract":"It has been shown that a complex orthogonal design that provides full diversity and full transmission rate for a space-time block code is not possible for more than two antennas. Previous attempts have been concentrated in generalizing orthogonal designs which provide space-time block codes with full diversity and a high transmission rate. We design rate one codes which are quasi-orthogonal and provide partial diversity. The decoder of the proposed codes works with pairs of transmitted symbols instead of single symbols","authors":["Hamid Jafarkhani"],"meta":["January 2001IEEE Transactions on Communications 49(1):1-4","DOI:10.1109/26.898239","SourceDBLP"],"references":["3234135_Space-Time_Block_Coding_for_Wireless_Communications_Performance_Results","3079484_Space-Time_Codes_for_High_Data_Rate_Wireless_Communication_Performance_Criterion_and_Code_Construction","244503086_Space-time_Codes_for_High_Rate_Wireless_Communication_Performance_analysis_and_code_construction","243783681_Orthogonal_Designs_Quadratic_Forms_and_Hadamard_Matrices","243765094_A_simple_transmitter_diversity_scheme_for_wireless_communications","3234069_A_simple_transmit_diversity_technique_for_wireless_communication","3079854_Space-Time_Block_Codes_from_Orthogonal_Designs"]}
