{"id":"337797310_Building_a_Blockchain_Application_that_Complies_with_the_EU_General_Data_Protection_Regulation","abstract":"Complying with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) poses significant\nchallenges for blockchain projects, including establishing clear responsibilities for\ncompliance, securing lawful bases for processing personal data, and observing rights to\nrectification and erasure. We describe how Germanyâ€™s Federal Office for Migration and\nRefugees addressed these challenges and created a GDPR-compliant blockchain solution\nfor cross-organizational workflow coordination. Based on the lessons learned, we provide\nthree recommendations for ensuring blockchain solutions are GDPR-compliant.","authors":["Alexander Rieger","Florian Guggenmos","Jannik Lockl","Gilbert Fridgen"],"meta":["December 2019MIS Quarterly Executive 18(4):263-279","DOI:10.17705/2msqe.00020","Project: Applications & Implications of Blockchain"],"references":[]}
