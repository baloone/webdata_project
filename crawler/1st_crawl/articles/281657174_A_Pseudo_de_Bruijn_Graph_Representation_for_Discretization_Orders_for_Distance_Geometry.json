{"id":"281657174_A_Pseudo_de_Bruijn_Graph_Representation_for_Discretization_Orders_for_Distance_Geometry","abstract":"Instances of the distance geometry can be represented by a simple weighted undirected graph G. Vertex orders on such graphs are discretization orders if they allow for the discretization of the K-dimensional search space of the distance geometry. A pseudo de Bruijn graph B associated to G is proposed in this paper, where vertices correspond to (K +1)-cliques of G, and there is an arc from one vertex to another if, and only if, they admit an overlap, consisting of K vertices of G. This pseudo de Bruijn graph B can be exploited for constructing discretization orders for G for which the consecutivity assumption is satisfied. A new atomic order for protein backbones is presented, which is optimal in terms of length.","authors":["Antonio Mucherino"],"meta":["May 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-16483-0_50","Conference: International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedical Engineering"],"references":["267664725_Distance_Geometry_Theory_Methods_and_Applications","263746015_GATB_genome_assembly_analysis_tool_box","256663913_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","242314200_On_the_Definition_of_Artificial_Backbones_for_the_Discretizable_Molecular_Distance_Geometry_Problem","226921079_The_interval_Branch_Prune_Algorithm_for_the_Discretizable_Molecular_Distance_Geometry_Problem_with_Inexact_Distances","225202160_Discretization_Orders_for_Distance_Geometry_Problems","224904730_Euclidean_Distance_Geometry_and_Applications","221131552_Influence_of_Pruning_Devices_on_the_Solution_of_Molecular_Distance_Geometry_Problems","51784417_How_to_apply_de_Bruijn_graphs_to_genome_assembly","49766085_DNA_assembly_for_synthetic_biology_From_parts_to_pathways_and_beyond","6222784_A_Graph-theory_Algorithm_for_Rapid_Protein_Side-chain_Prediction","281387823_Space-efficient_and_exact_de_Bruijn_graph_representation_based_on_a_Bloom_filter","266135774_Discretization_vertex_orders_in_distance_geometry","265836710_Distance_Geometry_in_Structural_Biology_New_Perspectives","265763243_An_Overview_on_Protein_Structure_Determination_by_NMR_Historical_and_Future_Perspectives_of_the_use_of_Distance_Geometry_Methods","265329498_On_the_Identification_of_Discretization_Orders_for_Distance_Geometry_with_Intervals","264824715_Discretization_Orders_for_Protein_Side_Chains","239597445_Embeddability_of_weighted_graphs_in_k-space_is_strongly_NP-hard","237128705_A_Combinatorial_Problem","228340096_Molecular_distance_geometry_methods_From_continuous_to_discrete","227658216_A_Branch-and-Prune_algorithm_for_the_Molecular_Distance_Geometry_Problem"]}
