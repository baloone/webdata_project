{"id":"274347835_Guided_Instruction_in_Logo_Programming_and_The_Development_of_Cognitive_Monitoring_Strategies_Among_College_Students","abstract":"This research examined whether an approach to teaching Logo programming that directly guided the student in the use of cognitive monitoring skills and the transfer of those skills would lead to increased cognitive monitoring and problem-solving skills. For this study, college students received either a guided approach to teaching Logo or a more traditional discovery approach. The results of this study demonstrated that guided instruction in Logo led to increased comprehension monitoring on both near transfer and far transfer tasks. Guided instruction in Logo programming also contributed to the development of Logo error identification and debugging skills.","authors":["Miok C.
