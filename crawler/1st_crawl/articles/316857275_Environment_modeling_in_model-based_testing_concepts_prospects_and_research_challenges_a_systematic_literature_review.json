{"id":"316857275_Environment_modeling_in_model-based_testing_concepts_prospects_and_research_challenges_a_systematic_literature_review","abstract":"In this paper, we describe a systematic literature review (SLR) on the use of environment models in model-based testing (MBT). By applying selection criteria, we narrowed down the identified studies from two hundred ninety seven papers to sixty one papers which are used in this analysis. The results show that environment models are especially useful in testing systems with high complexity and nondeterministic behaviors in terms of facilitating automatic test generation. However, building environment models is not a trivial task due to the lack of a systematic methodology and of supporting tools for automation.","authors":["Faezeh Siavashi","Dragos Truscan"],"meta":["April 2015","DOI:10.1145/2745802.2745830","Conference: Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering"],"references":["274470928_Lutin_A_Language_for_Specifying_and_Executing_Reactive_Scenarios","273125441_A_Systematic_Literature_Review_of_Environment_Modeling_Techniques_in_Model-Based_Testing","257440408_Model-based_robustness_testing_for_avionics-embedded_software","222673849_Systematic_literature_reviews_in_software_engineering-A_systematic_literature_review","221494546_Environmental_Simulation_of_Real-Time_Systems_with_Nested_Interrupts","221046906_Testing_Real-Time_Systems_Using_TINA","220872351_A_Methodology_and_a_Framework_for_Model-Based_Testing","220800974_Testing_real-time_embedded_software_using_UPPAAL-TRON_An_industrial_case_study","220689494_Practical_Model-Based_Testing_A_Tools_Approach","4274183_Test-Case_Generation_and_Coverage_Analysis_for_Nondeterministic_Systems_Using_Model-Checkers","313101272_Test-Case_generation_and_coverage_analysis_for_nondeterministic_systems_using_model-checkers","261075446_Systematic_literature_studies_Database_searches_vs_backward_snowballing","254033905_From_AUTOSAR_models_to_co-simulation_for_MiL-testing_in_the_automotive_domain","241629173_Time_Petri_Nets_Analysis_with_the_TINA_toolbox","234125583_A_Practical_Guide_to_SysML_the_Systems_Modeling_Language","223349437_Model-Driven_Architecture_for_Embedded_Software_A_Synopsis_and_an_Example","222401316_Environment_behavior_models_for_automation_of_testing_and_assessment_of_system_safety","222001554_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","221406742_Time_Petri_nets_analysis_with_TINA","221223535_Environment_Modeling_with_UMLMARTE_to_Support_Black-Box_System_Testing_for_Real-Time_Embedded_Systems_Methodology_and_Industrial_Case_Studies","221108674_Aspect-Oriented_Modeling_Bridging_the_Gap_between_Implementation_and_Design","215863688_The_Unified_Modeling_Language_Reference_Manual","33050833_A_Taxonomy_of_model-based_testing","23857782_Automated_Environment_Generation_for_Software_Model_Checking","4040396_Automated_environment_generation_for_software_model_checking"]}
