{"id":"324842028_On_the_Acceptability_Semantics_of_Argumentation_Frameworks_with_Recursive_Attack_and_Support","abstract":"The Attack-Support Argumentation Framework (ASAF) is an abstract argumentation framework that provides a unified setting for representing attack and support for arguments, as well as attack and support for the attack and support relations at any level. Currently, the extensions of the ASAF are obtained by translating it into a Dung's Argumentation Framework (AF). In this work we provide the ASAF with the ability of determining its extensions without requiring such a translation. We follow an extension-based approach for characterizing the acceptability semantics directly on the ASAF, considering the complete, preferred, stable and grounded semantics. Finally, we show that the proposed characterization satisfies different results from Dung's argumentation theory.","authors":["Andrea Cohen","Sebastian Gottifredi","Alejandro Javier Garcia","Guillermo Ricardo Simari"],"meta":["September 2016","DOI:10.3233/978-1-61499-686-6-231","Conference: International Conference on Computational Models of Argument.
