{"id":"257410005_Recovering_the_Sparsest_Element_in_a_Subspace","abstract":"We address the problem of recovering a sparse $n$-vector from an arbitrary\nbasis of a subspace spanned by the vector and $k$ random vectors. We prove that\nthe sparse vector will be the output to one of $n$ linear programs with high\nprobability if its support size $s$ satisfies $s \\lesssim n/\\sqrt{k \\log n}$.\nThe scaling law still holds when the desired vector is approximately sparse. To\nget a single estimate for the sparse vector from the $n$ linear programs, we\nmust select which output is the sparsest. This selection process has the\npotential to improve or worsen the scaling law. If sparsity is interpreted in\nan $\\ell_1/\\ell_\\infty$ sense, then the scaling law can not be better than $s\n\\lesssim n/\\sqrt{k}$. Computer simulations show that recovery may be greatly\nimproved if the sparsest output is selected in the $\\ell_1/\\ell_2$ or\nthresholded-$\\ell_0$ sense.","authors":["Paul Hand","Laurent Demanet"],"meta":["October 2013Information and Inference A Journal of the IMA 3(4)","DOI:10.1093/imaiai/iau007","SourcearXiv"],"references":["247456496_SDPT3_--_a_MATLAB_software_package_for_semidefinite_programming","234824961_Almost_Euclidean_subspaces_of_ell_N_1_via_expander_codes","228601297_SDPT3-A_Matlab_software_package_for_semidefinite_programming_version_21","227171059_Solving_Semidefinite-Quadratic-Linear_programs_using_SDPT3","222681193_On_approximation_of_functions_by_exponential_sums","23643947_Convex_Sparse_Matrix_Factorizations","263984402_ALMOST_EUCLIDEAN_SECTIONS_OF_THE_N-DIMENSIONAL_CROSS-POLYTOPE_USING_ON_RANDOM_BITS","258985389_Yalmip_A_toolbox_for_modeling_and_optimization_in_MATLAB","240966056_The_Null_Space_Problem_I_Complexity","237336571_Almost_Euclidean_subspaces_of_l1NVIA_expander_codes","235008705_Widths_of_certain_finite-dimensional_sets_and_classes_of_smooth_functions","228924959_Logarithmic_reduction_of_the_level_of_randomness_in_some_probabilistic_geometric_constructions","228060130_Exact_Recovery_of_Sparsely-Used_Dictionaries","226678976_The_Dimension_of_Almost_Spherical_Sections_of_Convex_Bodies","220481360_Phase_Retrieval_via_Matrix_Completion","47758386_Introduction_to_the_non-asymptotic_analysis_of_random_matrices","45933837_Matrix_Sparsification_and_the_Sparse_Null_Space_Problem","2281930_Blind_Source_Separation_by_Sparse_Decomposition","2118196_Stable_Signal_Recovery_from_Incomplete_and_Inaccurate_Measurements"]}
