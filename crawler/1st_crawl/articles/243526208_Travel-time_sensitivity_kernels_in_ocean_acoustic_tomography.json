{"id":"243526208_Travel-time_sensitivity_kernels_in_ocean_acoustic_tomography","abstract":"Wave-theoretic ocean acoustic propagation modeling is combined with the\npeak arrival approach for tomographic travel-time observables to derive\nthe sensitivity kernel of travel times with respect to sound-speed\nvariations. This is the Born-Fr√©chet kernel relating the\nthree-dimensional spatial distribution of sound-speed variations with\nthe induced travel-time variations. The derivation is based on the first\nBorn approximation of the Green's function. The application of the\ntravel-time sensitivity kernel to an ocean acoustic waveguide gives a\npicture close to the ray-theoretic one in the case of high frequencies.\nHowever, in the low-frequency case, of interest in ocean acoustic\ntomography, for example, there are significant deviations. Low-frequency\ntravel times are sensitive to sound-speed changes in Fresnel-zone-scale\nareas surrounding the eigenrays, but not on the eigenrays themselves,\nwhere the sensitivity is zero. Further, there are areas of positive\nsensitivity, where, e.g., a sound-speed increase results in an increase\nof arrival times, i.e., a further delay of arrivals, in contrast with\nthe common expectation. These findings are confirmed by forward acoustic\npredictions from a coupled-mode code.","authors":["Emmanuel Skarsoulis","B. D.
