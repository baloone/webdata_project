{"id":"283241469_Coexisting_Linear_and_Widely_Linear_Transceivers_in_the_MIMO_Interference_Channel","abstract":"Recent results have shown the benefits of widely linear precoding (WLP) in the MIMO interference channel (MIMO IC) assuming that all transmitters can follow the same strategy. Motivated by a transitional scenario where legacy linear transmitters coexist with widely linear ones, this work investigates the general K-user MIMO IC in a heterogeneous (linear and widely linear) transmitter deployment. In particular, we address the maximization of the weighted sum-rate (WSR) for (widely) linear transmit filters design through the use of the complex-valued formulation. Since the maximum WSR problem is non-convex, and thus difficult to be solved, we formulate an equivalent minimum weighted mean square error problem that allows deriving closed-form expressions for (widely) linear transceivers. Then an iterative procedure is proposed, which is proven to reach a stationary point of the maximum WSR problem. Simulations show that the proposed procedure allows increasing the sum-rate as compared to coordinated linear transceiver schemes. The gains are larger and significant in two different non-exclusive conditions: as the interference level increases or when the number of antennas is low.","authors":["Sandra Lag√©n","Adrian Agustin","Josep Vidal"],"meta":["January 2015IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing 64(3):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TSP.2015.2489604"],"references":["289665830_Decentralized_Beamforming_with_Coordinated_Sounding_for_inter-cell_interference_management","283779038_Decentralized_widely_linear_precoding_design_for_the_MIMO_interference_channel","281663367_Statistical_Signal_Processing_of_Complex-Valued_Data-_The_Theory_of_Improper_and_Noncircular_Signals","276906238_Improper_Gaussian_Signaling_Scheme_for_the_Z-Interference_Channel","275245326_Decentralized_Coordinated_Precoding_for_Dense_TDD_Small_Cell_Networks","273706684_Block-Skew-Circulant_Matrices_in_Complex-Valued_Signal_Processing","269294906_Improper_Gaussian_signaling_for_the_Z-interference_channel","268487090_Distributed_inter-cluster_interference_management_for_CoMP-based_cellular_networks","267068943_Interference_Alignment_-_A_New_Look_at_Signal_Dimensions_in_a_Communication_Network","261399454_Performance_gains_due_to_improper_signals_in_MIMO_broadcast_channels_with_widely_linear_transceivers"]}
