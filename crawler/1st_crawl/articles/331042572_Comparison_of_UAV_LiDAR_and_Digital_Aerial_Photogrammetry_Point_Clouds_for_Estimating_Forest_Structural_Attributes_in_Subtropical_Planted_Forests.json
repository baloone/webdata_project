High-resolution and low-cost remote-sensing data are increasingly available to measure three-dimensional (3D) canopy structure and model forest structural attributes. In this study, we compared two suites of point cloud metrics and the accuracies of predictive models of forest structural attributes using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and digital aerial photogrammetry (DAP) data, in a subtropical coastal planted forest of East China. A comparison between UAV-LiDAR and UAV-DAP metrics was performed across plots among different tree species, heights, and stem densities. The results showed that a higher similarity between the UAV-LiDAR and UAV-DAP metrics appeared in the dawn redwood plots with greater height and lower stem density. The comparison between the UAV-LiDAR and DAP metrics showed that the metrics of the upper percentiles (r for dawn redwood = 0.95–0.96, poplar = 0.94–0.95) showed a stronger correlation than the lower percentiles (r = 0.92–0.93, 0.90–0.92), whereas the metrics of upper canopy return density (r = 0.21–0.24, 0.14–0.15) showed a weaker correlation than those of lower canopy return density (r = 0.32–0.68, 0.31–0.52). The Weibull α parameter indicated a higher correlation (r = 0.70–0.72) than that of the Weibull β parameter (r = 0.07–0.60) for both dawn redwood and poplar plots. The accuracies of UAV-LiDAR (adjusted (Adj)R2 = 0.58–0.91, relative root-mean-square error (rRMSE) = 9.03%–24.29%) predicted forest structural attributes were higher than UAV-DAP (Adj-R2 = 0.52–0.83, rRMSE = 12.20%–25.84%). In addition, by comparing the forest structural attributes between UAV-LiDAR and UAV-DAP predictive models, the greatest difference was found for volume (△Adj-R2 = 0.09, △rRMSE = 4.20%), whereas the lowest difference was for basal area (△Adj-R2 = 0.03, △rRMSE = 0.86%). This study proved that the UAV-DAP data are useful and comparable to LiDAR for forest inventory and sustainable forest management in planted forests, by providing accurate estimations of forest structural attributes.","authors":["Lin Cao","Hao Liu","Xiaoyao Fu","Zhengnan Zhang"],"meta":["February 2019Forests 10(2):145","DOI:10.3390/f10020145"],"references":["328205956_Accuracy_of_Unmanned_Aerial_Vehicle_UAV_and_SfM_Photogrammetry_Survey_as_a_Function_of_the_Number_and_Location_of_Ground_Control_Points_Used","327917178_Vegetation_Phenology_Driving_Error_Variation_in_Digital_Aerial_Photogrammetrically_Derived_Terrain_Models","325333815_Digital_aerial_photogrammetry_for_assessing_cumulative_spruce_budworm_defoliation_and_enhancing_forest_inventories_at_a_landscape-level","323166566_A_model_development_and_application_guide_for_generating_an_enhanced_forest_inventory_using_airborne_laser_scanning_data_and_an_area-based_approach","323152787_Comparison_of_airborne_laser_scanning_and_digital_stereo_imagery_for_characterizing_forest_canopy_gaps_in_coastal_temperate_rainforests","321277333_Assessing_the_status_of_forest_regeneration_using_digital_aerial_photogrammetry_and_unmanned_aerial_systems","321143260_Tree-Species_Classification_in_Subtropical_Forests_Using_Airborne_Hyperspectral_and_LiDAR_Data","320110213_Estimating_Forest_Structural_Parameters_Using_Canopy_Metrics_Derived_from_Airborne_LiDAR_Data_in_Subtropical_Forests","325504016_Unit-level_and_area-level_small_area_estimation_under_heteroscedasticity_using_digital_aerial_photogrammetry_data","325284436_A_new_approach_with_DTM-independent_metrics_for_forest_growing_stock_prediction_using_UAV_photogrammetric_data"]}
