{"id":"344630380_New_multiplexing_method_to_add_a_new_signal_in_the_Galileo_E1_band","abstract":"This work addresses the problem of integrating a new signal in the Galileo E1 band. Thus, the arising question is how the existing multiplexing methods can be efficiently used or modified to integrate a new binary signal in the Galileo E1 band with the existing Galileo E1 signals. To this end, in this study, the authors first select three efficient multiplexing methods from the state of the art (i.e. interplexing, POCET and CEMIC methods) to multiplex a new Galileo signal along with the Galileo E1 legacy signals in a constant envelope modulation. Moreover, they evaluate their performance and main advantages and drawbacks. Secondly, in order to improve both performance and flexibility/adaptability of the multiplexing method, a modified CEMIC method, called ACEMIC, is proposed. This method allows to design modulations which maximise the power efficiency with respect to a given peak-to-average-power-ratio constraint. Finally, they compare the previous multiplexing methods in terms of power signal distribution, constant envelope fluctuation and power efficiency.","authors":["Lorenzo Ortega Espluga","Charly Poulliat","Marie Laure Boucheret","Marion Aubault-Roudier"],"meta":["September 2020IET Radar, Sonar & Navigation 14(11)","DOI:10.1049/iet-rsn.2020.0197"],"references":["325635447_New_solutions_to_reduce_the_time-to-CED_and_to_improve_the_CED_robustness_of_the_Galileo_INAV_message","303893960_BS-ACEBOC_a_generalized_low-complexity_dual-frequency_constant-envelope_multiplexing_modulation_for_GNSS","299648847_ACE-BOC_Dual-frequency_Constant_Envelope_Multiplexing_for_Satellite_Navigation","261335239_MBOC_the_new_optimized_spreading_modulation_recommended_for_GALILEO_L1_OS_and_GPS_L1C","329576550_Joint_Time-to-CED_Reduction_and_Improvement_of_CED_Robustness_in_the_Galileo_INAV_Message","313827163_Orthogonality-Based_Generalized_Multicarrier_Constant_Envelope_Multiplexing_for_DSSS_Signals","280014211_Binary_Offset_Carrier_Modulation_for_Radionavigation","278635496_GALILEO_signals_and_payload_optimization","271650352_Binary_Offset_Carrier_Modulations_for_Radio_Navigation","257493158_Unbalanced_AltBOC_a_Compass_B1_candidate_with_generalized_MPOCET_technique","255626746_The_MBOC_Modulation_The_Final_Touch_to_the_Galileo_Frequency_and_Signal_Plan","230801855_Numerical_Optimization_--_Theoretical_and_Practical_Aspects","234829535_RF_and_Digital_Signal_Processing_for_Software-Defined_Radio_A_Multi-Standard_Multi-Mode_Approach","231956015_Multiplexing_Performance_Assessment_of_POCET_Method_for_Compass_B1B3_Signals","224731001_Interplex--An_Efficient_Multichannel_PSKPM_Telemetry_System"]}
