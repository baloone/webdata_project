{"id":"284793935_An_Exceptional_Property_of_First_Zagreb_Index","abstract":"The first Zagreb index is a molecular structure descriptor defined as Sigma(v) deg(v)(2) where deg(v) is the degree (number of first neighbors) of the vertex v, and the summation embraces all vertices of the underlying molecular graph. We consider the generalized version of the first Zagreb index, defined as Sigma(v) deg(v)(p), and show that for p >= 3, its properties significantly differ from what is encountered in the case p = 2.","authors":["Ivan Gutman"],"meta":["January 2014MATCH Communications in Mathematical and in Computer Chemistry 72(3):733-740"],"references":["273318995_Degree-based_topological_indices_Optimal_trees_with_given_number_of_pendents","272898426_Degree-Based_Topological_Indices","234898712_Graph_Theory_and_Molecular_Orbitals_XII_Acyclic_Polyenes","222254320_Graph_Theory_and_Molecular_Orbitals_Total_-Electron_Energy_of_Alternant_Hydrocarbons"]}
