{"id":"348962617_Performance_Evaluation_of_Different_Mobile_Ad-hoc_Network_Routing_Protocols_in_Difficult_Situations","abstract":"Performance evaluation of Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET) routing protocols is essential for selecting the appropriate protocol for the network. Many routing protocols and different simulation tools were proposed to address this task. This paper will introduce an overview of MANETs routing protocols as well as evaluate MANET performance by using three reactive protocols—Dynamic Source Routing (DSR), AdHoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV), and Dynamic MANET On-Demand (DYMO)—in three different scenarios. These scenarios are designed carefully to mimic real situations by using OMNET++. The first scenario evaluates the performance when the number of nodes increases. In the second scenario, the performance of the network will be evaluated in the presence of obstacles. In the third scenario, a group of nodes will be suddenly shut down during the communication. The network evaluation is carried out in terms of packets received, end-to-end delay, transmission count or routing overhead, throughput, and packet ratio. ©2021, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications","authors":["Sultan Mohammed Alkahtani","Fahd Alturki"],"meta":["January 2021International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications 12(1)","DOI:10.14569/IJACSA.2021.0120119"],"references":["345971587_Optimized_Particle_Swarm_Optimization_Algorithm_for_the_Realization_of_an_Enhanced_Energy-Aware_Location-Aided_Routing_Protocol_in_MANET","344393758_Mobile_ad-hoc_network_routing_protocols_of_time-critical_events_for_search_and_rescue_missions","343343481_Performance_Analyzing_the_Effect_of_Network_Size_on_Routing_Protocols_in_MANETs","343340343_Performance_Evaluation_of_Three_Mobile_Ad-hoc_Network_Routing_Protocols_in_Different_Environments","341757200_Performance_Evaluation_of_Two_Mobile_Ad-hoc_Network_Routing_Protocols_Ad-hoc_On-Demand_Distance_Vector_Dynamic_Source_Routing","339439195_Performance_Evaluation_of_DYMO_and_OLSRv2_Routing_Protocols_in_VANET","339238760_Competitive_Analysis_of_Single_and_Multi-Path_Routing_Protocols_in_Mobile_Ad-Hoc_Network","343813059_Energy_Efficient_MANET_Routing_Protocol_based_on_Ant_Colony_Optimization","339908324_Performance_Evaluation_and_Analysis_of_Proactive_and_Reactive_MANET_Protocols_at_Varied_Speeds","338452974_Performance_Analysis_of_Ad-Hoc_On-Demand_Distance_Vector_AODV_and_Dynamic_Source_Routing_DSR_Routing_Protocols_During_Data_Broadcast_Storm_Problem_in_Wireless_Ad_Hoc_Network","331678234_PERFORMANCE_ANALYSIS_OF_AODV_IN_PRESENCE_OF_MALICIOUS_NODE","319427055_Improving_Quality_of_Service_in_Mobile_Ad-Hoc_Networks_MANETs_Using_Adaptive_Broadcast_Scheduling_Algorithm_with_Dynamic_Source_Routing_Protocol","316557352_Impact_of_Random_Mobility_Models_for_Reactive_Routing_Protocols_over_MANET","268344776_Performance_analysis_of_Dynamic_MANET_On-demand_DYMO_Routing_protocol_Performance_analysis_of_Dynamic_MANET_On-_demand_DYMO_Routing_protocol","335649868_An_Empirical_Study_of_Wireless_Security_in_City_Environment"]}
