{"id":"308723693_UMLtoGraphDB_Mapping_Conceptual_Schemas_to_Graph_Databases","abstract":"The need to store and manipulate large volume of (unstructured) data has led to the development of several NoSQL databases for better scalability. Graph databases are a particular kind of NoSQL databases that have proven their efficiency to store and query highly interconnected data, and have become a promising solution for multiple applications. While the mapping of conceptual schemas to relational databases is a well-studied field of research, there are only few solutions that target conceptual modeling for NoSQL databases and none of them focusing in graph databases. This is specially true when dealing with the mapping of business rules and constraints in the conceptual schema. In this article we describe a possible mapping from UML/OCL conceptual schemas to Blueprints, an abstraction layer on top of a variety of graph databases, and Grem-lin, a graph traversal language via an intermediate Graph metamodel representing data structure. Tool support is fully available.","authors":["Gwendal Daniel","Gerson Suny√©","Jordi Cabot"],"meta":["November 2016Lecture Notes in Computer Science","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-46397-1_33","Conference: ER 2016","Project: Conceptual Modeling"],"references":["303824470_Mogwai_a_Framework_to_Handle_Complex_Queries_on_Large_Models","299392067_Inferring_Versioned_Schemas_from_NoSQL_Databases_and_Its_Applications","296485511_NoSE_Schema_Design_for_NoSQL_Applications","289372760_NoSE_Schema_Design_for_NoSQL_Applications","280046702_Neo4EMF_A_scalable_persistence_layer_for_EMF_models","275647074_Neo4EMF_a_Scalable_Persistence_Layer_for_EMF_Models","321525171_Pro_Hibernate_and_MongoDB","313608490_On_the_architectural_alignment_of_ATL_and_QVT","289734479_Transforming_UML_class_diagrams_into_HBase_based_on_meta-model","278706354_Database_Design_for_NoSQL_Systems"]}
