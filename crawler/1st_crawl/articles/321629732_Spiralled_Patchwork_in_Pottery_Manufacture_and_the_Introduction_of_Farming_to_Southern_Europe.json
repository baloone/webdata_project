{"id":"321629732_Spiralled_Patchwork_in_Pottery_Manufacture_and_the_Introduction_of_Farming_to_Southern_Europe","abstract":"Pottery-manufacturing sequences can act as proxies for human migration and interaction. A good example is provided by the 'spiralled patchwork technology' (SPT) identified at two key early farming sites in the Ligurian-Provencal Arc in the north-west of the Italian peninsula. SPT is distinct from the ceramic technology used by early farmer communities in south-east Italy that shows technical continuity with the southern Balkans. Macroscopic analysis and micro-computed tomography suggests the presence of two communities of practice, and thus two distinct social groups in the northern Mediterranean: one of southern Balkan tradition, the other (associated with SPT) of as yet unknown origin. The identification of SPT opens up the exciting possibility of tracing the origins and migrations of a second distinct group of early farmers into Southern Europe.","authors":["Louise Gomart","Allon Weiner","Marzia Gabriele","Durrenmath Gilles"],"meta":["December 2017Antiquity 91(360):1501-1514","DOI:10.15184/aqy.2017.187","Project: Technical behaviours of the first farmers in the north-western Mediterranean: an integrated approach to ceramic production from Arene Candide Cave"],"references":["306319406_Pottery_smoothers_from_Colle_Santo_Stefano_Ortucchio_L'Aquila","303832578_Early_farmers_from_across_Europe_directly_descended_from_Neolithic_Aegeans","274009432_Tracing_the_genetic_origin_of_Europe's_first_farmers_reveals_insights_into_their_social_organization","260596666_First_Sculpted_Human_Face_in_the_Western_Mediterranean_Early_Neolithic","257577974_Spreading_of_Innovative_Technical_Traits_and_Cumulative_Technical_Evolution_Continuity_or_Discontinuity","257399971_Fibrous_Twists_and_Turns_early_Ceramic_Technology_revealed_through_Computed_Tomography","282324055_Household_integration_in_Neolithic_villages_A_new_model_for_the_Linear_Pottery_Culture_in_west-central_Europe","277025650_Identification_of_Pottery-Forming_Techniques_using_Quantitative_Analysis_of_the_Orientation_of_Inclusions_and_Voids_in_Thin_Sections","257154868_Non-destructive_fabric_analysis_of_prehistoric_pottery_using_high-resolution_X-ray_microtomography_A_pilot_study_on_the_late_Mesolithic_to_Neolithic_site_Hamburg-Boberg","254249418_Calibration_and_Visualization_of_Wall-Thickness_and_Porosity_Distributions_of_Ceramics_Using_X-radiography_and_Image_Processing"]}
