{"id":"280773270_Quantum_homomorphic_encryption_from_quantum_codes","abstract":"The recent discovery of fully-homomorphic classical encryption schemes has\nhad a dramatic effect on the direction of modern cryptography. Such schemes,\nhowever, implicitly rely on the assumptions that solving certain computation\nproblems are intractable. Here we present a quantum encryption scheme which is\nhomomorphic for arbitrary classical and quantum circuits which have at most\nsome constant number of non-Clifford gates. Unlike classical schemes, the\nsecurity of the scheme we present is information theoretic, satisfying entropic\nsecurity definitions, and hence independent of the computational power of an\nadversary.","authors":["Yingkai Ouyang","Si-Hui Tan","Joseph Fitzsimons"],"meta":["August 2015","DOI:10.1103/PhysRevA.98.042334","SourcearXiv"],"references":["301841877_Self-guaranteed_measurement-based_quantum_computation","277334053_Verifiable_Measurement-Only_Blind_Quantum_Computing_with_Stabilizer_Testing","268525365_A_quantum_approach_to_homomorphic_encryption","266747933_Quantum_fully_homomorphic_encryption_scheme_based_on_universal_quantum_circuit","263012365_Limitations_on_information_theoretically_secure_quantum_homomorphic_encryption","259826560_Quantum_computing_on_encrypted_data","256326983_Experimental_verification_of_quantum_computation","234131204_Composable_Security_of_Delegated_Quantum_Computation","228366247_Methodology_for_quantum_logic_gate_construction","228109483_WITHDRAWN_Quantum_cryptography_Public_key_distribution_and_coin_tossing","222554771_A_New_Protocol_and_Lower_Bounds_for_Quantum_Coin_Flipping","221935966_Unconditionally_verifiable_blind_computation","221768819_Demonstration_of_Blind_Quantum_Computing","221590193_Quantum_bit_escrow","221463088_Interactive_Proofs_For_Quantum_Computations","221354138_Evaluating_2-DNF_Formulas_on_Ciphertexts","51990434_Blind_quantum_computation_protocol_in_which_Alice_only_makes_measurements","47374659_Self-Testing_Graph_States","43148427_Random_Numbers_Certified_by_Bell's_Theorem","2203633_How_to_Share_a_Quantum_Secret","2203178_Quantum_Gambling","312685110_Quantum_cryptography_based_on_Bell's_theorem","303783232_Evaluating_2-_DNF_Formulas_on_Ciphertexts","285747735_Fully_homomorphic_encryption_with_polylog_overhead","270287377_Quantum_Homomorphic_Encryption_for_Circuits_of_Low_T-gate_Complexity","262257407_Certifiable_Quantum_Dice_Or_True_Random_Number_Generation_Secure_Against_Quantum_Adversaries","259983794_Optimal_Blind_Quantum_Computation","259983793_Efficient_Universal_Blind_Quantum_Computation","242584149_On_Data_Banks_and_Privacy_Homomorphisms","236338799_Classical_command_of_quantum_systems","236215226_Symmetric_quantum_fully_homomorphic_encryption_with_perfect_security","232718439_Quantum_Walks_with_Encrypted_Data","231816354_Unconditionally_Secure_Bit_Commitment_by_Transmitting_Measurement_Outcomes","228109551_Quantum_secret_sharing","228057769_Probability_Inequalities_for_Sums_of_Bounded_Random_Variables","224580081_The_Operational_Meaning_of_Min-_and_Max-Entropy","221996154_Probability_Inequalities_For_Sums_of_Bounded_Random_Variables","221591366_Fully_Homomorphic_Encryption_Using_Ideal_Lattices","221224343_Measurement-Based_and_Universal_Blind_Quantum_Computation","220335489_V_Fully_Homomorphic_Encryption_over_the_Integers","48204100_Optimal_Bounds_for_Quantum_Bit_Commitment","48194670_Unconditionally_Secure_Bit_Commitment_with_Flying_Qudits","31956533_Demonstrating_the_viability_of_universal_quantum_computation_using_teleportation_and_single-qubit_operations","13245023_Ekert_AK_Quantum_Cryptography_Based_on_Bell's_Theorem_Phys_Rev_Lett_676_661","2204576_On_the_Theory_of_Quantum_Secret_Sharing","2200868_Entropic_security_in_Quantum_Cryptography","2198533_Reexamination_of_Quantum_Bit_Commitment_the_Possible_and_the_Impossible","2192340_Universal_quantum_computation_with_ideal_Clifford_gates_and_noisy_ancillas","2187016_Secure_assisted_quantum_computation","1897302_Quantum_Entropic_Security_and_Approximate_Quantum_Encryption","1743640_Universal_Blind_Quantum_Computation"]}
