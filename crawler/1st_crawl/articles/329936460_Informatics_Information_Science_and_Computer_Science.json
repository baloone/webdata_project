{"id":"329936460_Informatics_Information_Science_and_Computer_Science","abstract":"In this paper, I draw a distinction between information and computer sciences in terms of their\nobjects and directions of research. In terms of the operating mode, I distinguish among automatic, automated,\nsemi-automatic, and assistant systems and show that in each application domain there can be different\nconfigurations of these systems at different periods of time. In addition, I analyze the engineering, linguistic,\nand mathematical aspects of domain-specific research that falls within scope of informatics to formulate some problems, and\ndiscuss promising directions.","authors":["Viatcheslav A.
