{"id":"272083794_Quantitative_and_logic_modelling_of_molecular_and_gene_networks","abstract":"Behaviours of complex biomolecular systems are often irreducible to the elementary properties of their individual components. Explanatory and predictive mathematical models are therefore useful for fully understanding and precisely engineering cellular functions. The development and analyses of these models require their adaptation to the problems that need to be solved and the type and amount of available genetic or molecular data. Quantitative and logic modelling are among the main methods currently used to model molecular and gene networks. Each approach comes with inherent advantages and weaknesses. Recent developments show that hybrid approaches will become essential for further progress in synthetic biology and in the development of virtual organisms.","authors":["Nicolas Le Novere"],"meta":["February 2015Nature Reviews Genetics 16(3)","DOI:10.1038/nrg3885","SourcePubMed"],"references":["290173456_How_to_infer_gene_networks_from_expression_profiles","322746774_Gene_network_inference_and_visualization_tools_for_biologists_application_to_new_human_transcriptome_datasets","317730552_Guidelines_for_the_use_and_interpretation_of_assays_for_monitoring_autophagy","313199043_The_systems_biology_markup_language_SBML_A_medium_for_representation_and_exchange_of_biochemical_network_models","292631930_An_Extended_Transcriptional_Network_for_Pluripotency_of_Embryonic_Stem_Cells_DOI101016jcell200802039","292136724_A_community-driven_global_reconstruction_of_human_metabolism","291776833_Guidelines_for_the_use_and_interpretation_of_assays_for_monitoring_autophagy","288233308_Boolean_formalisation_of_genetic_control_circuits","284894477_Xppaut","282095282_The_control_of_flux"]}
