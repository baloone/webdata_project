{"id":"277722662_Trading_Classical_and_Quantum_Computational_Resources","abstract":"We propose examples of a hybrid quantum-classical simulation where a\nclassical computer assisted by a small quantum processor can efficiently\nsimulate a larger quantum system. First we consider sparse quantum circuits\nsuch that each qubit participates in O(1) two-qubit gates. It is shown that any\nsparse circuit on n+k qubits can be simulated by sparse circuits on n qubits\nand a classical processing that takes time $2^{O(k)} poly(n)$. Secondly, we\nstudy Pauli-based computation (PBC) where allowed operations are\nnon-destructive eigenvalue measurements of n-qubit Pauli operators. The\ncomputation begins by initializing each qubit in the so-called magic state.\nThis model is known to be equivalent to the universal quantum computer. We show\nthat any PBC on n+k qubits can be simulated by PBCs on n qubits and a classical\nprocessing that takes time $2^{O(k)} poly(n)$. Finally, we propose a purely\nclassical algorithm that can simulate a PBC on n qubits in a time $2^{c n}\npoly(n)$ where $c\\approx 0.94$. This improves upon the brute-force simulation\nmethod which takes time $2^n poly(n)$. Our algorithm exploits the fact that\nn-fold tensor products of magic states admit a low-rank decomposition into\nn-qubit stabilizer states.","authors":["Sergey Bravyi","Graeme Smith","John A.
