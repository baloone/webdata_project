{"id":"331281508_Gamma_spaces_and_information","abstract":"We investigate the role of Segalâ€™s Gamma-spaces in the context of classical and quantum information, based on categories of finite probabilities with stochastic maps and density matrices with quantum channels. The information loss functional extends to the setting of probabilistic Gamma-spaces considered here. The Segal construction of connective spectra from Gamma-spaces can be used in this setting to obtain spectra associated to certain categories of gapped systems.","authors":["Matilde Marcolli"],"meta":["February 2019Journal of Geometry and Physics 140","DOI:10.1016/j.geomphys.2019.02.004"],"references":["260193629_A_Bayesian_Characterization_of_Relative_Entropy","51958019_A_Characterization_of_Entropy_in_Terms_of_Information_Loss","326968308_Motivic_Information","324366238_Mathematical_Foundations_of_Information_Theory","302378090_What_can_topology_tell_us_about_the_neural_code","270512728_Neural_Codes_and_Homotopy_Types_Mathematical_Models_of_Place_Field_Recognition","265926102_On_the_concept_of_entropy_of_a_finite_probabilistic_scheme","259435604_Quillen_model_categories","255682305_Stable_homotopical_algebra_and_G-spaces","251351538_Homotopy_theory_of_G-spaces_spectra_and_bisimplicial_sets","243009175_Combinatorial_methods_in_the_study_of_marginal_problems_over_separable_spaces","241360123_Smash_products_and_G-spaces","238878862_Consistent_Families_of_Measures_and_Their_Extensions","228599789_On_the_algebra_of_cubes","226907507_Trunks_and_classifying_spaces","222439366_Fuzzy_Sets","220608555_Geometric_Realisations_of_Cubical_Sets_with_Connections_and_Classifying_Spaces_of_Categories","220452562_The_Euler_Characteristic_is_the_Unique_Locally_Determined_Numerical_Homotopy_Invariant_of_Finite_Complexes","37687843_Simplicial_Objects_in_Algebraic_Topology","7190047_ABSTRACT_HOMOTOPY_IV","2809076_Symmetric_Monoidal_Categories_Model_All_Connective_Spectra","2218455_An_elementary_illustrated_introduction_to_simplicial_sets"]}
