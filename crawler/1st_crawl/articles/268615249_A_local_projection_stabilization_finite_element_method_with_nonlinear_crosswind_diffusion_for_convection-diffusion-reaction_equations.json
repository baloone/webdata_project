{"id":"268615249_A_local_projection_stabilization_finite_element_method_with_nonlinear_crosswind_diffusion_for_convection-diffusion-reaction_equations","abstract":"An extension of the local projection stabilization (LPS) finite element method for convection-diffusion-reaction equations is presented and analyzed, both in the steady-state and the transient setting. In addition to the standard LPS method, a nonlinear crosswind diffusion term is introduced that accounts for the reduction of spurious oscillations. The existence of a solution can be proved and, depending on the choice of the stabilization parameter, also its uniqueness. Error estimates are derived which are supported by numerical studies. These studies demonstrate also the reduction of the spurious oscillations.","authors":["Gabriel R.
