We show, how a symmetry of the\nnetwork and invariance of the problem under a given transformation group $G$\ncan be utilized to simplify its solution. We prove, that for a $G$-invariant\nmaximum lifetime problem there exists a $G$-invariant solution. Constrains\nwhich follow from the $G$-invariance allow to reduce the problem and its\nsolution to a subset, an optimal fundamental region of the sensor network. We\nanalyze in detail solutions of the maximum lifetime problem invariant under a\ngroup of isometry transformations of a two dimensional Euclidean plane.","authors":["Zbigniew Lipi≈Ñski"],"meta":["April 2017Wireless Networks 23(3)","DOI:10.1007/s11276-016-1354-4","SourcearXiv"],"references":["240829678_Symmetry_in_Constraint_Programming","274646711_Finite_Reflection_Groups","248150526_Transformation_Geometry_An_Introduction_to_Symmetry","238501962_Chapter_10_Symmetry_in_constraint_programming","226916685_Symmetry_in_Integer_Linear_Programming","4149781_Maximizing_the_functional_lifetime_of_sensor_networks","3842622_Energy_conserving_routing_in_wireless_ad-hoc_networks","2379876_Power-Aware_Routing_in_Mobile_Ad_Hoc_Networks"]}
