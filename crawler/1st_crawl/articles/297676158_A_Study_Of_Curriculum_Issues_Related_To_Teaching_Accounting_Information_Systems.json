{"id":"297676158_A_Study_Of_Curriculum_Issues_Related_To_Teaching_Accounting_Information_Systems","abstract":"This paper evaluates factors that educators believe contribute to an effective AIS course. Based on a survey of 100 faculty members, there is a lack of consensus about whether to include a computerized simulation in AIS, but respondents who do are less satisfied with the course than those who do not. Faculty members who are very satisfied with their AIS course consider coverage of internal controls and transaction cycles to be most important.","authors":["H. Sam Riner","Terrye A.
