{"id":"220154441_Picture_languages_Tiling_systems_versus_tile_rewriting_grammars","abstract":"Two formal models of pictures, i.e., two dimensional (2D) languages are compared: tiling systems and tile rewriting grammars, which resp. extend to 2D the regular and context-free languages. Two results extending classical language properties into 2D are proved. First, non-recursive tile writing grammars (TRG) coincide with tiling systems (TS). Second, non-self-embedding TRG are suitably defined as corner grammars, showing that they generate TS languages. The proofs exploit newly introduced language substitutions, also nested and iterated.","authors":["Alessandra Cherubini","Stefano Crespi Reghizzi","Matteo Pradella","Pierluigi San Pietro"],"meta":["May 2006Theoretical Computer Science 356(1-2):90-103","DOI:10.1016/j.tcs.2006.01.038","SourceDBLP"],"references":["220266867_Finite_Automata_and_Non-self-Embedding_Grammars","2813073_Regular_Expressions_and_Context-Free_Grammars_for_Picture_Languages","247182585_Picture_Languages_Formal_Models_for_Picture_Recognition","220713240_Advances_in_array_languages","220311810_Some_properties_of_two-dimensional_on-line_tessela-tion_acceptors","220249063_A_Note_on_Phrase_Structure_Grammars","220152998_Tile_rewriting_grammars_and_picture_languages","220151753_Collage_of_two-dimensional_words","4355855_Full_AFLS_and_nested_iterated_substitution","2525098_A_Characterization_of_Recognizable_Picture_Languages_By_Tilings_By_Finite_Sets","2422930_Two-Dimensional_Languages"]}
