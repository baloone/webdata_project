This has been experimented within junior high schools, high schools, universities as E-Learning strategies and supplementary approach with different subject modules including programming, science, mathematics, computer science. This paper reviews the varied applications of Game based learning as a supplementary teaching technique in schools, universities for programming education. The study focuses on student-driven digital game making over a systematic review of the global contributions on related topics published since 2010. The review begins with a rationale for GBL adoption in pedagogy. This is followed by analysis of different GBL models, the effectiveness of GBL in programming and other subjects together with a prospective of GBL based education in Sri Lanka, a South Asian country.","authors":["Piyumi N Herath"],"meta":["November 2021International Journal of Scientific and Engineering Research 12(11):1168","Project: GBL for Programming Education"],"references":["274378317_A_Serious_Game_for_Developing_Computational_Thinking_and_Learning_Introductory_Computer_Programming","232517189_The_I's_Have_It_A_Framework_for_Serious_Educational_Game_Design","225794248_Game_object_model_version_II_A_theoretical_framework_for_educational_game_development","222704794_The_Impact_of_Computer_Use_on_Children's_and_Adolescents'_Development","220066167_Exploring_the_Learning_Mechanism_in_Educational_Games","301293019_PlayIT_Game_Based_Learning_Approach_for_Teaching_Programming_Concepts","284089093_Computer_games_Environments_for_developing_spatial_cognition","257171500_A_collaborative_game-based_learning_approach_to_improving_students'_learning_performance_in_science_courses","223301305_Digital_Game-Based_Learning_in_high_school_Computer_Science_education_Impact_on_educational_effectiveness_and_student_motivation"]}
