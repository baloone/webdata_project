{"id":"322652559_Outlook_for_inverse_design_in_nanophotonics","abstract":"Recent advancements in computational inverse design have begun to reshape the landscape of structures and techniques available to nanophotonics. Here, we outline a cross section of key developments at the intersection of these two fields: moving from a recap of foundational results to motivation of emerging applications in nonlinear, topological, near-field and on-chip optics.","authors":["Sean J.
