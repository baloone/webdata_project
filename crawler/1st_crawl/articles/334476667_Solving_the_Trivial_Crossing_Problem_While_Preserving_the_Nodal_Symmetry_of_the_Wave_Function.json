{"id":"334476667_Solving_the_Trivial_Crossing_Problem_While_Preserving_the_Nodal_Symmetry_of_the_Wave_Function","abstract":"In adiabatic mixed quantum-classical simulation, the avoided crossing of weakly coupled eigenstates can lead to unphysical discontinuities in wavefunction dynamics, otherwise known as the trivial crossing problem. A standard solution to the trivial crossing problem eliminates spatial discontinuities in wavefunction dynamics by imposing changes in the eigenstate of the wavefunction. In this paper, we show that this solution has the side-effect of introducing transient discontinuities in the nodal symmetry of the wavefunction. We present an alternative solution to the trivial crossing problem that preserves both the spatial and nodal structure of the adiabatic wavefunction. By considering a model of exciton dynamics on conjugated polymer systems, we show that failure to preserve wavefunction symmetry yields exciton dynamics that depend unphysically on polymer system size. We demonstrate that our symmetry preserving solution to the trivial crossing problem yields more realistic dynamics, and can thus improve the accuracy of simulations of larger systems that are prone to the trivial crossing problem.","authors":["Elizabeth M Y Lee","Adam P.
