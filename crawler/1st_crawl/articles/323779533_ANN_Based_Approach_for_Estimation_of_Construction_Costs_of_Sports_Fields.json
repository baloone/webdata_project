{"id":"323779533_ANN_Based_Approach_for_Estimation_of_Construction_Costs_of_Sports_Fields","abstract":"Cost estimates are essential for the success of construction projects. Neural networks, as the tools of artificial intelligence, offer a significant potential in this field. Applying neural networks, however, requires respective studies due to the specifics of different kinds of facilities. This paper presents the proposal of an approach to the estimation of construction costs of sports fields which is based on neural networks. The general applicability of artificial neural networks in the formulated problem with cost estimation is investigated. An applicability of multilayer perceptron networks is confirmed by the results of the initial training of a set of various artificial neural networks. Moreover, one network was tailored for mapping a relationship between the total cost of construction works and the selected cost predictors which are characteristic of sports fields. Its prediction quality and accuracy were assessed positively. The research results legitimatize the proposed approach.","authors":["Micha≈Ç Juszczyk","Agnieszka Lesniak","Krzysztof Zima"],"meta":["March 2018Complexity 2018(1):1-11","DOI:10.1155/2018/7952434","Project: Methods of supporting cost calculation of construction works"],"references":["345122084_The_Challenges_of_Nonparametric_Cost_Estimation_of_Construction_Works_with_the_use_of_Artificial_Intelligence_Tools","286318109_Artificial_Neural_Networks_incorporating_cost_significant_Items_towards_enhancing_estimation_for_life-cycle_costing_of_construction_projects","282845806_An_Artificial_Neural_Network_Approach_to_Structural_Cost_Estimation_of_Building_Projects_in_the_Philippines","281513259_Application_of_Boosting_Regression_Trees_to_Preliminary_Cost_Estimation_in_Building_Construction_Projects","321596155_From_Product_Description_to_Cost_A_Practical_Approach_Volume_1_The_Parametric_Approach","315369726_Site_Overhead_Cost_Index_Prediction_Using_RBF_Neural_Networks","283110930_Application_of_committees_of_neural_networks_for_conceptual_cost_estimation_of_residential_buildings","273024650_Case_Adaptation_Method_of_Case-Based_Reasoning_for_Construction_Cost_Estimation_in_Korea","260829515_The_Use_of_Artificial_Neural_Networks_for_Residential_Buildings_Conceptual_Cost_Estimation","260829313_The_Application_of_Artificial_Neural_Networks_in_Indirect_Cost_Estimation"]}
