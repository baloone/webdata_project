{"id":"233531973_Utility_Optimization_in_Heterogeneous_Networks_via_CSMA-Based_Algorithms","abstract":"We study algorithms for carrier and rate allocation in cellular systems with\ndistributed components such as a heterogeneous LTE system with macrocells and\nfemtocells. Existing work on LTE systems often involves centralized techniques\nor requires significant signaling, and is therefore not always applicable in\nthe presence of femtocells. More distributed CSMA-based algorithms\n(carrier-sense multiple access) were developed in the context of 802.11 systems\nand have been proven to be utility optimal. However, the proof typically\nassumes a single transmission rate on each carrier. Further, it relies on the\nCSMA collision detection mechanisms to know whether a transmission is feasible.\nIn this paper we present a framework for LTE scheduling that is based on CSMA\ntechniques. In particular we first prove that CSMA-based algorithms can be\ngeneralized to handle multiple transmission rates in a multi-carrier setting\nwhile maintaining utility optimality. We then show how such an algorithm can be\nimplemented in a heterogeneous LTE system where the existing Channel Quality\nIndication (CQI) mechanism is used to decide transmission feasibility.","authors":["Matthew Andrews","Lisa Zhang"],"meta":["January 2017Wireless Networks 23(1)","DOI:10.1007/s11276-015-1149-z","SourcearXiv"],"references":["229156619_Making_80211_DCF_Near-Optimal_Design_Implementation_and_Evaluation","228857466_Distributed_power_allocation_and_user_assignment_in_OFDMA_cellular_networks","224237824_REFIM_A_Practical_Interference_Management_in_Heterogeneous_Wireless_Access_Networks","324424212_Reversibility_and_Stochastic_Networks","314781160_Reversibility_and_Stochastic_Networks","268161446_Reversibility_and_stochastic_networks_With_a_new_preface_Reprint_of_the_1979_ed","266270447_Hypercyclic_weighted_translations_on_groups","261392737_Backlog-Based_Random_Access_in_Wireless_Networks_Fluid_Limits_and_Instability_Issues","241630267_Effect_of_access_probabilities_on_the_delay_performance_of_Q-CSMA_algorithms","228009320_Towards_utility-optimal_random_access_without_message_passing","224137118_Resource_Allocation_over_Network_Dynamics_without_Timescale_Separation","224084300_A_Distributed_CSMA_Algorithm_for_Throughput_and_Utility_Maximization_in_Wireless_Networks","221640073_Joint_Optimization_of_Radio_Resources_in_Small_and_Macro_Cell_Networks","221596524_Network_Adiabatic_Theorem_An_Efficient_Randomized_Protocol_for_Contention_Resolution","221595904_Delay_optimal_queue-based_CSMA"]}
