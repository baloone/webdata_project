{"id":"325685886_3D_Printing_Model_Random_Encryption_Based_on_Geometric_Transformation","abstract":"Due to the fact that 3D printing has been recently applied in many areas of life, a large amount of 3D printing models have been attacked and stolen by hackers. Moreover, some special models and anti-weapon models used in 3D printing must be secured from unauthorized users. Therefore, 3D printing models must be encrypted before being stored and transmitted in order to prevent illegal copying. In this paper, we present a random encryption algorithm for 3D printing models. The proposed algorithm is based on randomly encrypting the vertices of each facet using a secret key after the geometric transformation process. Each facet of the 3D printing model is distorted by a geometric transformation and the three vertices of each distorted facet are then used to construct a 3 × 3 matrix. The coefficients of the constructed matrix are randomly encrypted using the random numbers of another matrix in order to generate the encrypted 3D printing model. The experimental results verify that the proposed algorithm is very effective for 3D printing models. The entire 3D triangle mesh is altered after the encryption process. The proposed algorithm is a better method and offers more security than the previously reported methods. © 2018, International Association of Computer Science and Information Technology.","authors":["Giao N.
