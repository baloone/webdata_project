The authors discuss the main reasons of gap in knowledge on computer science at first-year students and suggest suitable teaching to solve the indicated challenge. The considered teaching is based on the principle of continuity to teaching which provide correlation between various levels of education and improving the effectiveness of teaching. \nThe different levels of the studentsâ€™ learning outcomes on computer science is considered as one of the most important cause of the investigated challenge. For this reason, the authors investigate the educational process design and the differentiated learning methodology using the Google Classroom technology aimed to the bridging knowledge gap in computer science.","authors":["Zhanat Kopeyev","Akan Mubarakov","Kultan Jaroslav","Gaukhar Aimicheva"],"meta":["January 2020International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning (iJET) 15(02):218","DOI:10.3991/ijet.v15i02.11602"],"references":["331758289_Social_Media_Usage_Patterns_in_Higher_Education_Institutions_-_An_Empirical_Study","325456015_Information_Communication_Technology_Use_among_Students_in_Inclusive_Classrooms","325427097_Students_Acceptance_of_Google_Classroom_An_Exploratory_Study_using_PLS-SEM_Approach","321356130_Bringing_computational_thinking_to_teachers'_training_a_workshop_review","319959476_Demystifying_computational_thinking","279437426_Bridging_the_Knowledge_Gap_between_Secondary_and_Higher_Education","247924673_Bringing_computational_thinking_to_K-12_what_is_Involved_and_what_is_the_role_of_the_computer_science_education_community","318600661_Changing_a_Generation's_Way_of_Thinking_Teaching_Computational_Thinking_Through_Programming","262399549_Computational_thinking_in_educational_activities_An_evaluation_of_the_educational_game_Light-Bot","262391259_Factors_impacting_student_perceptions_of_computing_and_CIS_majors"]}
