{"id":"220532665_Computing_the_Tutte_Polynomial_on_Graphs_of_Bounded_Clique-Width","abstract":"The Tutte polynomial is a notoriously hard graph invariant, and efficient algorithms for it are known only for a few special graph classes, like for those of bounded tree-width. The notion of clique-width extends the definition of cographs ( graphs without induced P-4), and it is a more general notion than that of tree-width. We show a subexponential algorithm ( running in time expO(n(1-epsilon))) for computing the Tutte polynomial on graphs of bounded clique- width. In fact, our algorithm computes the more general U-polynomial.","authors":["Omer Gim√©nez","Petr Hlineny","Marc Noy"],"meta":["January 2006SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics 20(4):932-946","SourceDBLP"],"references":["226017874_Linear_Time_Solvable_Optimization_Problems_on_Graphs_of_Bounded_Clique_Width","222354208_An_algorithm_for_the_Tutte_polynomials_of_graphs_of_bounded_treewidth","220753023_Approximating_Rank-Width_and_Clique-Width_Quickly","220617851_A_Parametrized_Algorithm_for_Matroid_Branch-Width","239477097_Computing_the_chromatic_polynomial_on_graphs_of_bounded_clique-width","239066782_A_weighted_graph_polynomial_from_chromatic_invariants_of_knots","231831212_On_the_computational_complexity_of_the_Jones_and_Tutte_polynomials","223529096_Edge_dominating_set_and_colorings_on_graphs_with_fixed_clique-width","222296805_Upper_Bounds_to_the_Clique-Width_of_Graphs","220695656_A_Course_in_Combinatorics"]}
