{"id":"226981453_Quantitative_functions_for_size_and_distance_judgments","abstract":"A psychophysical approach was used to obtain judgments of visual extent under three conditions. In tuvo conditions a comparison\nstimulus at each of two distances was matched in size to a standard which varied in distance. Stimuli were presented on a\nwell-lighted table and were judged by two observers under Objective instructions. Both the standard and comparison were located\nin either a frontal or longitudinal plane. In a third condition relative distance estimates were given of two stimuli which\nvaried in their relative positions along the table. The mean results for all conditions were described as a power function\nof physical stimulus measures. The exponent was greater than 1.0 for frontal size and usually less than 1.0 for flat size\nand distance. The position of the comparison affected the magnitude of the exponents to a lesser degree. These findings have\nrelevance for interpretations of size and distance judgments.","authors":["John C. Baird","William R.
