{"id":"307720029_An_Epistemic_Separation_Logic","abstract":"We define an Epistemic Separation Logic, called ESL, that allows us to consider epistemic possible worlds as resources that can be shared or separated, in the spirit of separation logics. After studying the semantics and the expressiveness of this logic, we provide a tableau calculus with labels and resource contraints that is sound and complete and then also study countermodel extraction.","authors":["Jean-Ren√© Courtault","Hans van Ditmarsch","Didier Galmiche"],"meta":["July 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-3-662-47709-0_12","Conference: International Workshop on Logic, Language, Information, and Computation"],"references":["254853660_Bisimulations_on_Planet_Kripke","225967272_Reasoning_About_Knowledge_In_Linear_Logic_Modalities_and_Complexity","222698041_Algebra_and_Sequent_Calculus_for_Epistemic_Actions","220607963_Logics_of_Public_Communications","220388040_Tableaux_for_Public_Announcement_Logic","220202727_Dynamic_Logic_of_Preference_Upgrade","23573527_Reasoning_About_Knowledge","2130166_Epistemic_Actions_as_Resources","302216331_A_Modal_BI_Logic_for_Dynamic_Resource_Properties","275166094_The_formal_strong_completeness_of_partial_monoidal_Boolean_BI","267434439_A_Simple_Separation_Logic","259810884_Dynamic_Epistemic_Logic","242353736_The_Semantics_and_Proof_Theory_of_the_Logic_of_Bunched_Implications","239547196_Epistemic_Logic_for_AI_and_Computer_Science","237128408_Recent_Work_in_Epistemic_Logic","228668072_The_Semantics_of_BI_and_Resource_Tableaux","225549537_A_Separation_Logic_for_Resource_Distribution","221942985_Linear_Logic","220173294_Algebra_and_logic_for_resource-based_systems_modelling","3965916_Separation_logic_A_logic_for_shared_mutable_data_structures","2895661_BI_as_an_Assertion_Language_for_Mutable_Data_Structures"]}
