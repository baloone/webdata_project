{"id":"297369590_Scholarly_publication_patterns_in_the_social_sciences_and_humanities_and_their_coverage_in_Scopus_and_Web_of_Science","abstract":"In this study, we analyse the differences in coverage between Scopus, Web of Science, and Thomson Reuters' Book Citation Index). We also estimate the degree to which they deviate from a full coverage of all peer-reviewed scholarly publications. The focus is on what types journals and book publishers that make up for these differences. The purpose of the study is to discuss the options for an improved coverage of the SSH in international bibliographic data sources in the future.","authors":["Gunnar Sivertsen"],"meta":["September 2014","Conference: Proceedings of the science and technology indicators conference 2014 LeidenAt: Leiden: CWTSVolume: E.
