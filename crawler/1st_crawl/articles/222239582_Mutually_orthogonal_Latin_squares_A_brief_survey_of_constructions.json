{"id":"222239582_Mutually_orthogonal_Latin_squares_A_brief_survey_of_constructions","abstract":"In the two centuries since Euler first asked about mutually orthogonal latin squares, substantial progress has been made. The biggest breakthroughs came in 1960 with the celebrated theorems of Bose, Shrikhande, and Parker, and in 1974 in the research of Wilson. Current efforts have concentrated on refining these approaches, and finding new applications of the substantial theory opened. This paper provides a detailed list of constructions for MOLS, concentrating on the uses of pairwise balanced designs and transversal designs in recursive constructions as pioneered in the papers of Bose, Shrikhande, and Parker. In addition, several new lower bounds for MOLS are given and an up-to-date table of lower bounds for MOLS is provided.","authors":["Charles J. Colbourn","Jeffrey H.
