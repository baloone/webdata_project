{"id":"229157994_Online_and_Quasi-online_Colorings_of_Wedges_and_Intervals","abstract":"We consider proper online colorings of hypergraphs defined by geometric\nregions. Among others we prove that there is an online coloring method that\ncolors $N$ intervals on the line using $\\Theta(\\log N/k)$ colors such that for\nevery point $p$, contained in at least $k$ intervals, there exist two intervals\ncontaining $p$ and having different colors. We prove the corresponding (but not\nequivalent) result about online coloring quadrants in the plane that are\nparallel to a given fixed quadrant. These results contrast to recent results of\nthe first and third author showing that in the quasi-online setting 12 colors\nare enough to color quadrants (independent of $N$ and $k$). We also consider\ncoloring intervals in the quasi-online setting. In all cases we present\nefficient coloring algorithms as well.","authors":["Balázs Keszegh","Nathan Lemons","Dömötör Pálvölgyi"],"meta":["November 2016Order 33(3)","DOI:10.1007/s11083-015-9374-8","SourcearXiv"],"references":["235432410_Coloring_Hypergraphs_Induced_by_Dynamic_Point_Sets_and_BottomlessRectangles","306123265_Survey_on_Decomposition_of_Multiple_Coverings","284687586_On_some_packing_problems_relating_to_dynamical_storage_allocation","278799252_Coloring_Hypergraphs_Induced_by_Dynamic_Point_Sets_and_Bottomless_Rectangles","229699907_On-line_and_first-fit_coloring_of_graphs","229345874_Online_hypergraph_coloring","228610594_New_perspectives_on_interval_orders_and_interval_graphs","228102887_Octants_are_Cover-Decomposable_into_Many_Coverings","225779556_On-line_coloringk-colorable_graphs","222645855_Online_coloring_of_hypergraphs"]}
