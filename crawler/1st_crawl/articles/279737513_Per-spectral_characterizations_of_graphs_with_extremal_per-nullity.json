{"id":"279737513_Per-spectral_characterizations_of_graphs_with_extremal_per-nullity","abstract":"A graph G is said to be determined by its permanental spectrum if any graph having the same permanental spectrum as G is isomorphic to G. In this paper, we introduce the permanental nullity of a graph, the multiplicity of the number zero in the permanental spectrum of a graph, to study graphs determined by their permanental spectra. First, we determine all graphs of order n whose permanental nullities are , , and , respectively. Then, we show that all graphs with the permanental nullity , , or , and all non-bipartite graphs with the permanental nullity are determined by their permanental spectra. In particular, we prove that the complete bipartite graphs are determined by their permanental spectra.","authors":["Tingzeng Wu","Heping Zhang"],"meta":["November 2015Linear Algebra and its Applications 484","DOI:10.1016/j.laa.2015.06.018"],"references":["268019010_A_Note_on_the_Permanental_Roots_of_Bipartite_Graphs","267696172_Per-spectral_characterizations_of_some_edge-deleted_subgraphs_of_a_complete_graph","256584487_Computing_the_Permanental_Polynomial_of_a_Matrix_from_a_Combinatorial_Viewpoint","233532134_Spectral_characterizations_of_almost_complete_graphs","225206133_On_the_Permanental_Polynomials_of_Some_Graphs","220191970_Developments_on_Spectral_Characterizations_of_Graphs","4866317_Which_Graphs_are_Determined_by_their_Spectrum","285737362_Chemical_graph_theory_III_On_the_permanental_polynomial","284222287_On_the_nullity_of_unicyclic_graphs","283559921_Paths_trees_flowers","271666180_Variational_localized-site_cluster_expansions","268972983_On_spectrum_and_per-spectrum_of_graphs","268656309_Nullity_of_graphs","268609679_On_the_nullity_of_graphs","268552948_Relations_between_the_permanental_and_characteristic_polynomials_of_fullerenes_and_benzenoid_hydrocarbons","266584341_Remarks_on_the_Relations_Between_the_Permanental_and_Characteristic_Polynomials_of_Fullerenes","266012860_A_note_on_the_relations_between_the_permanental_and_characteristic_polynomials_of_coronoid_hydrocarbons","265771945_Nullity_of_graphs_An_updated_survey","265718014_Cospectral_Graphs_and_Digraphs","263688077_Characterizing_properties_of_permanental_polynomials_of_lollipop_graphs","256805376_On_the_characterizing_properties_of_the_permanental_polynomials_of_graphs","246782197_Maximale_Systeme_Unabhangiger_Kanten","241073937_A_characterization_of_graphs_with_rank_4","234942442_Some_Studies_in_Molecular_Orbital_Theory_I_Resonance_Structures_and_Molecular_Orbitals_in_Unsaturated_Hydrocarbons","230303298_Zusammenhang_von_Graphentheorie_und_MO-Theorie_von_Molekeln_mit_Systemen_konjugierter_Bindungen","222958722_Permanental_polynomials_of_graphs","222808307_The_Complexity_of_Computing_the_Permanent","47338231_Computing_the_permanental_polynomials_of_bipartite_graphs_by_Pfaffian_orientation","12278312_Permanental_Polynomials_of_the_Smaller_Fullerenes","12278311_The_Permanental_Polynomial"]}
