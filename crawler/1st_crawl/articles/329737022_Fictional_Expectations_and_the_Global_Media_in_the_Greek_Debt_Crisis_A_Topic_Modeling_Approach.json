{"id":"329737022_Fictional_Expectations_and_the_Global_Media_in_the_Greek_Debt_Crisis_A_Topic_Modeling_Approach","abstract":"We study the role of global media during the Greek debt crisis and relate\nit to the transmission of events on financial actors’ expectations. To identify news\ncoverage about the Greek debt crisis, we apply topic modelling to a newly compiled\ndataset of over 430,000 articles from The International New York Times and\nFinancial Times from 2009 to 2015. We identify a Greek debt crisis topic and relate\nit to events concerning Greece during this time period. Our finding is that events\nare only relevant for financial markets when they are covered in the media,\nwhereas events without media coverage have no effect. News coverage without\nimmediate events is equally irrelevant for financial markets.","authors":["Agnes Janssen","Volker Daniel","Magnus Neubert"],"meta":["December 2018Jahrbuch für Wirtschaftsgeschichte / Economic History Yearbook 59(2):525–566","DOI:10.1515/jbwg-2018-0018","Projects: Fictional Expectations in EconomicsExpectations and the Greek Debt Crisis"],"references":[]}
