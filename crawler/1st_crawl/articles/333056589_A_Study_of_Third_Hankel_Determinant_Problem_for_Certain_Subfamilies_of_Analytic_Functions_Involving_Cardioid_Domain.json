{"id":"333056589_A_Study_of_Third_Hankel_Determinant_Problem_for_Certain_Subfamilies_of_Analytic_Functions_Involving_Cardioid_Domain","abstract":"In the present article, we consider certain subfamilies of analytic functions connected with the cardioid domain in the region of the unit disk. The purpose of this article is to investigate the estimates of the third Hankel determinant for these families. Further, the same bounds have been investigated for two-fold and three-fold symmetric functions.","authors":["Lei Shi","Izaz Ali","Muhammad Arif","Nak Eun Cho"],"meta":["May 2019","DOI:10.3390/math7050418"],"references":["331592832_Inclusion_relations_for_certain_families_of_integral_operators_associated_with_conic_regions","331588697_Upper_Bound_of_the_Third_Hankel_Determinant_for_a_Subclass_of_q-Starlike_Functions","331288825_Some_Subclasses_of_Uniformly_Univalent_Functions_with_Respect_to_Symmetric_Points","331158966_Hankel_and_Toeplitz_Determinants_for_a_Subclass_of_q-Starlike_Functions_Associated_with_a_General_Conic_Domain","328311264_Third-Order_Hankel_Determinant_for_Certain_Class_of_Analytic_Functions_Related_with_Exponential_Function","328271641_The_Bound_of_the_Hankel_Determinant_of_the_Third_Kind_for_Starlike_Functions","328152336_Some_Coefficient_Inequalities_of_Q-Starlike_Functions_Associated_with_Conic_Domain_Defined_by_Q-Derivative","326189147_The_Sharp_Bound_of_the_Hankel_Determinant_of_the_Third_Kind_for_Starlike_Functions_of_Order_1_2","329389658_Hankel_Determinant_for_a_Subclass_of_Bi-Univalent_Functions_Defined_by_Using_a_Symmetric_q-Derivative_Operator","324231370_THE_SHARP_BOUND_FOR_THE_HANKEL_DETERMINANT_OF_THE_THIRD_KIND_FOR_CONVEX_FUNCTIONS"]}
