{"id":"283553300_A_blended_learning_framework_for_curriculum_design_and_professional_development","abstract":"The need for flexibility in learning and the affordances of technology provided the impetus for the rise of blended learning (BL) globally across higher education institutions. However, the adoption of BL practices continues at a low pace due to academics' low digital fluency, various views and BL definitions, and limited standards-based tools to guide academic practice. To address these issues, this paper introduces a BL framework, based on one definition and with criteria and standards of practice to support the evaluation and advancement of BL in higher education. The framework is theoretically underpinned by the extant literature and supported by focus group discussions. The evidence supporting the criteria and standards are discussed with suggestions for how they can be used to guide course design, academic practice, and professional development.","authors":["Negin Mirriahi","Dennis Alonzo","Bob Fox"],"meta":["October 2015Research in Learning Technology 23","DOI:10.3402/rlt.v23.28451"],"references":["285713531_Design_and_evaluation_of_two_blended_learning_approaches_Lessons_learned","284688507_Blended_learning_enters_the_mainstream","280839158_Staff_experience_and_attitudes_towards_Technology_Enhanced_Learning_initiatives_in_one_Faculty_of_Health_Life_Sciences","269900385_The_five_resources_of_critical_digital_literacy_A_framework_for_curriculum_integration","269830011_Learning_from_the_early_adopters_developing_the_Digital_Practitioner","354333631_Shedding_Light_on_Students'_Technology_Preferences_Implications_for_Academic_Development","277200187_Online_collaboration_and_offline_interaction_between_students_using_asynchronous_tools_in_blended_learning","272119597_Teachers'_Beliefs_and_Technology_Practices","270585193_Visible_Learning_A_Synthesis_of_Over_800_Meta-Analyses_Relating_to_Achievement","268293735_A_N_AN_INSTRUCTIONAL_MEDIA_SELECTION_GUIDE_F_O_R_DISTANCE_LEARNING"]}
