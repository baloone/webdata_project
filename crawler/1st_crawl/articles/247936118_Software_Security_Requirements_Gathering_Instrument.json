{"id":"247936118_Software_Security_Requirements_Gathering_Instrument","abstract":"Security breaches are largely caused by the vulnerable software. Since individuals and organizations mostly depend on softwares, it is important to produce in secured manner. The first step towards producing secured software is through gathering security requirements. This paper describes Software Security Requirements Gathering Instrument (SSRGI) that helps gather security requirements from the various stakeholders. This will guide the developers to gather security requirements along with the functional requirements and further incorporate security during other phases of software development. We subsequently present case studies that describe the integration of the SSRGI instrument with Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document as specified in standard IEEE 830-1998. Proposed SSRGI will support the software developers in gathering security requirements in detail during requirements gathering phase.","authors":["Smriti Jain","Maya Ingle"],"meta":["August 2011International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications 2(7)","DOI:10.14569/IJACSA.2011.020717"],"references":["228861036_Combining_functional_and_security_requirement_processes_by_Martyn","228605351_Capturing_security_requirements_through_misuse_cases","239166940_Security_Requirements_-_A_Field_Study_of_Current_Practice","224127066_Threat-_and_Risk-Analysis_During_Early_Security_Requirements_Engineering","221014926_Software_Security_Checklist_for_the_Software_Life_Cycle","220298978_A_Common_Criteria_Based_Approach_for_COTS_Component_Selection","4274074_CCARCH_Architecting_Common_Criteria_Security_Requirements","2348562_IEEE_Recommended_Practice_for_Software_Requirements_Specications"]}
