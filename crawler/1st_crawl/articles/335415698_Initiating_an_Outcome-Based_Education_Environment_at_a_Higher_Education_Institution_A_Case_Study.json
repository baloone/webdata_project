{"id":"335415698_Initiating_an_Outcome-Based_Education_Environment_at_a_Higher_Education_Institution_A_Case_Study","abstract":"The paper presents a brief account of a case study reflecting steps that may be found useful as guidelines for initiating an outcome-based education (OBE) environment for programs at a higher education institution (HEI). It highlights the broad steps in the process of establishing a framework for a curriculum of an undergraduate program in light of current trends, with suggestions that may be helpful in paving the way for a HEI to follow, should such an aim be desired. A sample of a computer science (CMSC) program is used as an example to illustrate the steps followed in accordance with relevant academic accreditation criteria and quality assurance (QA) standards.","authors":["Amira Bibo Sallow","Muaid Abdlqader","Nada E.
