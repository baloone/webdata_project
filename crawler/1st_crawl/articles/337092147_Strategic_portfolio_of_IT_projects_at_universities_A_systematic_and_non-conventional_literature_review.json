{"id":"337092147_Strategic_portfolio_of_IT_projects_at_universities_A_systematic_and_non-conventional_literature_review","abstract":"One of the most accepted review methods in the scientific community is the Systematic Literature Review (SLR). A SLR process allows determining the interest of the scientific community in the subject matter of the preliminary research, the type of research and the areas of knowledge to which the topic is more related, among other aspects. For our research, we need to determine the scientific basis of the portfolio of information technology (IT) project, as initial good practice for the implementation of an IT governance culture. Universities have been specifically selected as the type of organization in the communities that have developed formal processes and good practices for the implementation of IT governance. In addition to the SLR, a review was carried out based on non-conventional literature from repositories of prestigious professional organizations and universities. It is concluded that the portfolio of IT projects is a good practice of IT governance and that there is an interest from the scientific community. From this analysis, it is clear that there are works in both the area of Computer Science and the Administration of Organizations.","authors":["Francisco Xavier Valverde Alulema","Faraón Llorens"],"meta":["May 2019Ingenieria e Investigación 39(2)","DOI:10.15446/ing.investig.v39n2.72431"],"references":["316945461_A_study_on_the_impact_of_non-operational_mechanisms_on_the_effectiveness_of_public_IT_governance","309430778_Project_and_Program_Management_Implications_in_the_Portfolio_Management_of_IT_Projects_in_Applied_RD_Organizations","308568890_Information_Technology_Governance_in_Public_Sector_Organizations","271769332_To_govern_IT_or_not_to_govern_IT","330089092_Visibilidad_e_impacto_de_la_literatura_gris_cientifica_en_repositorios_institucionales_de_acceso_abierto_Estudio_de_caso_bibliometrico_del_repositorio_Gredos_de_la_Universidad_de_Salamanca","309423317_Integrating_IT_Portfolio_Management_with_Enterprise_Architecture_Management","297337103_Field_research_in_information_and_communication_technologies_Governance_strategy_at_Universidad_de_medellin","284234525_Business_process_management_and_IT_management_The_missing_integration","282953487_A_Modeling_Approach_for_IT_Governance_Basics_Application_on_IT_Projects_and_IT_Goals","272867698_Integrating_IT_Portfolio_Management_with_Enterprise_Architecture_Management"]}
