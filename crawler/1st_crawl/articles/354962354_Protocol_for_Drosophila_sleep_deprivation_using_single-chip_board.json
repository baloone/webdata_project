{"id":"354962354_Protocol_for_Drosophila_sleep_deprivation_using_single-chip_board","abstract":"Sleep behavior is characterized by long-term quiescence and increased arousal threshold, and it is homeostatically regulated. The sleep rebound after deprivation is utilized to verify the abilities to maintain homeostasis. This protocol shows how to build a programmed mechanic oscillation system and detailed procedures to conduct sleep deprivation in Drosophila. This deprivation system is featured by its programming flexibility. The knowledge of electronic circuits and a certain level of programming are both required to fulfill this protocol.\nFor complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Jin et al.
