{"id":"265490932_On_Bayesian_Upper_Confidence_Bounds_for_Bandit_Problems","abstract":"Stochastic bandit problems have been ana-lyzed from two different perspectives: a fre-quentist view, where the parameter is a deter-ministic unknown quantity, and a Bayesian approach, where the parameter is drawn from a prior distribution. We show in this paper that methods derived from this second per-spective prove optimal when evaluated using the frequentist cumulated regret as a mea-sure of performance. We give a general for-mulation for a class of Bayesian index policies that rely on quantiles of the posterior distri-bution. For binary bandits, we prove that the corresponding algorithm, termed Bayes-UCB, satisfies finite-time regret bounds that imply its asymptotic optimality. More gen-erally, Bayes-UCB appears as an unifying framework for several variants of the UCB algorithm addressing different bandit prob-lems (parametric multi-armed bandits, Gaus-sian bandits with unknown mean and vari-ance, linear bandits). But the generality of the Bayesian approach makes it possible to address more challenging models. In par-ticular, we show how to handle linear ban-dits with sparsity constraints by resorting to Gibbs sampling.","authors":["Emilie Kaufmann","Olivier Cappé","Aurélien Garivier Ltci","Telecom Paristech"],"meta":[],"references":["288933771_Solving_two-armed_Bernoulli_bandit_problems_using_a_Bayesian_learning_automaton","243026421_Optimal_Adaptive_Policies_for_Sequential_Allocation_Problems","228582199_Four_proofs_of_Gittins'_multiarmed_bandit_theorem","221345649_Gaussian_Process_Optimization_in_the_Bandit_Setting_No_Regret_and_Experimental_Design","220343796_Finite-time_Analysis_of_the_Multiarmed_Bandit_Problem","239292007_Asymptotically_efficient_adaptive_allocation_rules1","221497653_An_Asymptotically_Optimal_Bandit_Algorithm_for_Bounded_Support_Models","221497234_Stochastic_Linear_Optimization_under_Bandit_Feedback","220320997_Regret_Bounds_and_Minimax_Policies_under_Partial_Monitoring","216300669_Bandit_Processes_and_Dynamic_Allocation_Indices_With_Discussion","201976635_On_the_Likelihood_That_One_Unknown_Probability_Exceeds_Another_in_View_of_the_Evidence_of_Two_Samples","38360211_Adaptive_Treatment_Allocation_and_the_Multi-Armed_Bandit_Problem","4329516_Simulation_Studies_of_Multi-armed_Bandits_with_Covariates_Invited_Paper"]}
