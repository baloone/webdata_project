{"id":"243049020_Improved_likelihood_ratio_tests_and_Pearson_chi-squared_tests_for_independence_in_two_dimensional_contingency_tables","abstract":"When an IÃ—J contingency table has many cells having very small frequencies, the usual chi-square approximation to the upper tail of the likelihood ratio goodness-of-fit statistic, G and Pearson chi-square statistic, X, for testing independence, are not satisfactory. In this paper we consider the problem of adjusting G and X. Suitable adjustments are suggested on the basis of analytical investigation of asymptotic bias terms for G and X. A Monte Carlo simulation is performed for several tables to assess the adjustments of G and X in order to obtain a closer approximation to the nominal level of significance.","authors":["Balakrishna S.
