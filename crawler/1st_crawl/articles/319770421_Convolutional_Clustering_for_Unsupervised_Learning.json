{"id":"319770421_Convolutional_Clustering_for_Unsupervised_Learning","abstract":"The task of labeling data for training deep neural networks is daunting and tedious, requiring millions of labels to achieve the current state-of-the-art results. Such reliance on large amounts of labeled data can be relaxed by exploiting hierarchical features via unsupervised learning techniques. In this work, we propose to train a deep convolutional network based on an enhanced version of the k-means clustering algorithm, which reduces the number of correlated parameters in the form of similar filters, and thus increases test categorization accuracy. We call our algorithm convolutional k-means clustering. We further show that learning the connection between the layers of a deep convolutional neural network improves its ability to be trained on a smaller amount of labeled data. Our experiments show that the proposed algorithm outperforms other techniques that learn filters unsupervised. Specifically, we obtained a test accuracy of 74.1% on STL-10 and a test error of 1.4% on MNIST.","authors":["Aysegul Dundar","Jonghoon Jin","Eugenio Culurciello"],"meta":["November 2016","Conference: ICLR"],"references":[]}
