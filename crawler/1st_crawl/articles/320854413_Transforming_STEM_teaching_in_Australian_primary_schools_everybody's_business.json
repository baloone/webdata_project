{"id":"320854413_Transforming_STEM_teaching_in_Australian_primary_schools_everybody's_business","abstract":"A strong economy in the twenty-first century prospers through science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). Across the world, nations are competing for the high-growth firms and highly capable workers of the future; and securing the pipelines in their education systems today. They know that children entering the education system in 2016 will be joining a very different workforce in 2030. They see the rising premium on skills in STEM. In these nations, STEM education counts.\n\nThese are the steps we can take today to make great teaching of science, technology and mathematics the norm in Australian schools, and teaching a profession of choice for our high achievers.\n1. Raise the prestige and preparedness of teachers, by\n(i) Attracting high achievers in STEM to primary\nschool teaching.\n(ii) Boosting the science, technology and mathematics\nin pre-service teaching and increasing the rigour of\npre-service courses.\n2. Transform STEM education in primary schools, by\n(iii) Ensuring teachers in every school are supported\nby specialist teachers in STEM disciplines.\n(iv) Creating a national professional development\nprogram in science, technology and mathematics.\n(v) Educating principals to be leaders in STEM.\n3. Think bold, collaborate and lead change.","authors":["Roslyn Prinsley","Ewan Johnston"],"meta":["December 2015","Report number: Position Paper December 2015"],"references":["276229909_Addressing_the_challenges_of_a_new_digital_technologies_curriculum_MOOCs_as_a_scalable_solution_for_teacher_professional_development","263554509_Monitoring_Australian_Year_4_student_achievement_internationally_TIMSS_and_PIRLS_2011","256731063_STEM_Country_comparisons","259982063_Finnish_Lessons_What_Can_the_World_Learn_from_Educational_Change_in_Finland","245766176_Confidence_and_Understanding_in_Teaching_Science_and_Technology_in_Primary_Schools","44838959_How_the_World's_Best-Performing_School_Systems_Come_Out_on_Top"]}
