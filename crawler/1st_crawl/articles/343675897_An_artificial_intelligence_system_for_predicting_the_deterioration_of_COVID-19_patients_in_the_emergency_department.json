{"id":"343675897_An_artificial_intelligence_system_for_predicting_the_deterioration_of_COVID-19_patients_in_the_emergency_department","abstract":"During the COVID-19 pandemic, rapid and accurate triage of patients at the emergency department is critical to inform decision-making. We propose a data-driven approach for automatic prediction of deterioration risk using a deep neural network that learns from chest X-ray images, and a gradient boosting model that learns from routine clinical variables. Our AI prognosis system, trained using data from 3,661 patients, achieves an AUC of 0.786 (95% CI: 0.742-0.827) when predicting deterioration within 96 hours. The deep neural network extracts informative areas of chest X-ray images to assist clinicians in interpreting the predictions, and performs comparably to two radiologists in a reader study. In order to verify performance in a real clinical setting, we silently deployed a preliminary version of the deep neural network at NYU Langone Health during the first wave of the pandemic, which produced accurate predictions in real-time. In summary, our findings demonstrate the potential of the proposed system for assisting front-line physicians in the triage of COVID-19 patients.","authors":["Farah Shamout","Yiqiu Shen","Nan Wu","Aakash Kaku"],"meta":["August 2020"],"references":["338332372_International_evaluation_of_an_AI_system_for_breast_cancer_screening","337832074_Align_Attend_and_Locate_Chest_X-Ray_Diagnosis_via_Contrast_Induced_Attention_Network_With_Limited_Supervision","336635705_Prediction_of_BAP1_Expression_in_Uveal_Melanoma_Using_Densely-Connected_Deep_Classification_Networks","343461402_Evaluating_Weakly_Supervised_Object_Localization_Methods_Right","340170194_Checklist_for_Artificial_Intelligence_in_Medical_Imaging_CLAIM_A_Guide_for_Authors_and_Reviewers","339556516_Joint_Learning_of_Saliency_Detection_and_Weakly_Supervised_Semantic_Segmentation","338736336_Deep_Neural_Networks_With_Region-Based_Pooling_Structures_for_Mammographic_Image_Classification","338506820_Learning_Instance_Activation_Maps_for_Weakly_Supervised_Instance_Segmentation","337701975_Thorax_Disease_Classification_with_Attention_Guided_Convolutional_Neural_Network","336465143_An_Attention-Guided_Deep_Regression_Model_for_Landmark_Detection_in_Cephalograms"]}
