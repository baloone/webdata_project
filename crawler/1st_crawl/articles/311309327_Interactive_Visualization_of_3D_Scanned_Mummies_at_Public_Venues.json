{"id":"311309327_Interactive_Visualization_of_3D_Scanned_Mummies_at_Public_Venues","abstract":"BY COMBINING VISUALIZATION techniques with interactive\nmulti-touch tables and intuitive user interfaces, visitors\nto museums and science centers can conduct self-guided\ntours of large volumetric image data. In an interactive\nlearning experience, visitors become the explorers of\notherwise invisible interiors of unique artifacts and\nsubjects. Here, we take as our starting point the state of\nthe art in scanning technologies, then discuss the latest\nresearch on high-quality interactive volume rendering\nand how it can be tailored to meet the speciÔ¨Åc demands","authors":["Anders Ynnerman","Thomas Rydell","Daniel Antoine","David Hughes"],"meta":["December 2016Communications of the ACM 59(12):72-81","DOI:10.1145/2950040"],"references":["304823671_State_of_the_Art_in_Transfer_Functions_for_Direct_Volume_Rendering","279506262_The_Scientific_Analysis_of_Human_Remains_from_the_British_Museum_Collection_Research_Potential_and_Examples_from_the_Nile_Valley","260582961_Historygrams_Enabling_Interactive_Global_Illumination_in_Direct_Volume_Rendering_using_Photon_Mapping","3411300_Full_Body_Virtual_Autopsies_using_a_State-of-the-art_Volume_Rendering_Pipeline","306182150_The_Best_of_Both_Worlds_Museums_Libraries_and_Archives_in_a_Digital_Age","277024392_Considered_Limitations_and_Possible_Applications_of_Computed_Tomography_in_Mummy_Research","276364134_State-of-the-Art_in_GPU-Based_Large-Scale_Volume_Visualization","271552260_A_preliminary_study_on_multi-touch_based_medical_image_analysis_and_visualization_system","259547795_A_Survey_of_Volumetric_Illumination_Techniques_for_Interactive_Volume_Rendering","222427193_A_Pilot_Study_Into_the_Effects_of_X-ray_and_Computed_Tomography_Exposure_on_the_Amplification_of_DNA_From_Bone","51751959_Image_Plane_Sweep_Volume_Illumination","47544638_FI3D_Direct-Touch_Interaction_for_the_Exploration_of_3D_Scientific_Visualization_Spaces","22751707_Computed_Tomography_of_Ancient_Egyptian_Mummies","3410757_Optical_models_for_direct_volume_rendering"]}
