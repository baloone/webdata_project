{"id":"297544086_The_relative_importance_of_technical_and_interpersonal_skills_for_new_information_systems_personnel","abstract":"Computer personnel need a balance of both technical and interpersonal skills to develop information systems (ISs) that meet users' requirements. Organizations which recruit IS graduates were surveyed to better understand the necessary skills for new IS personnel, and the relative importance of those different skills. New IS graduates must have strong written and oral communication abilities. No single technical skill was rated above the interpersonal skills of writing and speaking. Additionally, new IS hires must be able to work in a cross-functional group. New graduates should be proficient in client-server development, object-oriented programming techniques, third-generation languages, and systems development methodologies. Low-level languages, multimedia computing, desktop publishing, and experience with workgroup software received lower ratings than interpersonal skills and familiarity with contemporary development techniques. Because employers see the value of practical application of technical and interpersonal skills, an internship or some other form of full-time work experience is important for IS graduates.","authors":["Dale Young"],"meta":["June 1996"],"references":["321919139_Needed_Better_communication_from_data_processors"]}
