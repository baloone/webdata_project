{"id":"301706373_Approximating_k-Median_via_Pseudo-Approximation","abstract":"We present a novel approximation algorithm for k-median that achieves an approximation guarantee of 1 + root 3 + epsilon, improving upon the decade-old ratio of 3 + epsilon. Our improved approximation ratio is achieved by exploiting the power of pseudo-approximation. More specifically, our approach is based on two components, each of which, we believe, is of independent interest. First, we show that in order to give an alpha-approximation algorithm for k-median, it is sufficient to give a pseudo-approximation algorithm that finds an alpha-approximate solution by opening k + O(1) facilities. This is a rather surprising result as there exist instances for which opening k + 1 facilities may lead to a significantly smaller cost than that of opening only k facilities. Second, we give such a pseudo-approximation algorithm with alpha = 1 + root 3 + epsilon. Prior to our work, it was not even known whether opening k + o(k) facilities would help improve the approximation ratio.","authors":["Shi Li","Ola Svensson"],"meta":["January 2016SIAM Journal on Computing 45(2):530-547","DOI:10.1137/130938645"],"references":["228822554_Approximation_algorithms_for_metric_facility_location_and_k-Median_problems_using_the_primal-dual_schema_and_Lagrangian_relaxation","221590229_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Facility_Location_Problems_Extended_Abstract","220618395_Improved_Approximation_Algorithms_for_the_Uncapacitated_Facility_Location_Problem","220618117_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Metric_Facility_Location_Problems","220532729_A_Hierarchy_of_Relaxations_Between_the_Continuous_and_Convex_Hull_Representations_for_Zero-One_Programming_Problems","220133216_An_Explicit_Equivalent_Positive_Semidefinite_Program_for_Nonlinear_0-1_Programs","41386496_An_Optimal_Bifactor_Approximation_Algorithm_for_the_Metric_Uncapacitated_Facility_Location_Problem","2533772_Greedy_Facility_Location_Algorithms_Analyzed_using_Dual_Fitting_with_Factor-Revealing_LP","227447865_A_Heuristic_Program_For_Locating_Warehouses","227442838_Plant_Location_Under_Economies-of-Scale-Decentralization_and_Computation","222936253_Analysis_of_a_Local_Search_Heuristic_for_Facility_Location_Problems","222680788_A_Constant-Factor_Approximation_Algorithm_for_the_k-Median_Problem","221590526_e-Approximations_with_Minimum_Packing_Constraint_Violation_Extended_Abstract","221498264_Stability_Yields_a_PTAS_for_k-Median_and_k-Means_Clustering","220669268_Mathematical_Programming_for_Data_Mining_Formulations_and_Challenges","2626480_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Geometric_Median_Problems","2450711_Greedy_Strikes_Back_Improved_Facility_Location_Algorithms"]}
