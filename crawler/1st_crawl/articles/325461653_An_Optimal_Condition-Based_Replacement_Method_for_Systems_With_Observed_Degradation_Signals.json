{"id":"325461653_An_Optimal_Condition-Based_Replacement_Method_for_Systems_With_Observed_Degradation_Signals","abstract":"Condition-based maintenance for a degrading system has been attached great importance in reducing unexpected failures and enabling the safe operation of the system. In this paper, we consider a condition-based replacement problem with observed degradation signals for the determination of the optimal replacement time of the system. The observed degradation signals contain some health related information of the system so that the systemâ€™s health state may be more accurately estimated and the future degradation progression of the system can be predicted. Based on the predicted degradation state, the concerned replacement problem is formulated in the framework of the Markov decision process and then a new degradation-modeling framework based on maximum likelihood estimation is proposed to analyze the degradation signals and to predict the future degradation state of the system. To solve the proposed condition-based replacement decision problem, we analyze structural properties of the optimal replacement policy and an optimal monotonic control limit solution policy is developed for condition-based replacement. Finally, a case study is provided to illustrate the proposed optimal replacement method.","authors":["Xiaosheng Si","Tianmei Li","Qi Zhang","Xiaoxiang Hu"],"meta":["May 2018IEEE Transactions on Reliability PP(99):1-13","DOI:10.1109/TR.2018.2830188"],"references":["305340021_Multiple_Sensor_Data_Fusion_for_Degradation_Modeling_and_Prognostics_Under_Multiple_Operational_Conditions","304573332_Maintenance_Optimization_for_a_Markovian_Deteriorating_System_with_Population_Heterogeneity","275381512_Use_of_PHM_Information_and_System_Architecture_for_Optimized_Aircraft_Maintenance_Planning","259657633_How_do_heterogeneities_in_operational_environments_affect_field_failures","259294751_Degradation_Data_Analysis_Using_Wiener_Processes_With_Measurement_Errors","227681706_A_Bayesian_Inventory_Model_Using_Real-Time_Condition_Monitoring_Information","38363055_Survival_in_Dynamic_Environment","328250074_Maintenance_Replacement_and_Reliability_Theory_and_Applications_Second_Edition","323314455_Degradation_Data_Analysis_and_Remaining_Useful_Life_Estimation_A_Review_on_Wiener-Process-Based_Methods","319607601_A_Prognostic_Model_for_Stochastic_Degrading_Systems_With_State_Recovery_Application_to_Li-Ion_Batteries","318988020_Statistical_Modeling_of_Bearing_Degradation_Signals","317044853_An_adaptive_degradation-based_maintenance_model_taking_into_account_both_imperfect_adjustments_and_AGAN_replacements","316863403_A_condition-based_maintenance_policy_for_degrading_systems_with_age-_and_state-dependent_operating_cost","307874649_A_review_on_condition-based_maintenance_optimization_models_for_stochastically_deteriorating_system","304616801_An_Improved_Exponential_Model_for_Predicting_Remaining_Useful_Life_of_Rolling_Element_Bearings","296482007_A_Two-Stage_Data-Driven-Based_Prognostic_Approach_for_Bearing_Degradation_Problem","283835112_Condition-Based_Maintenance_With_Scheduling_Threshold_and_Maintenance_Threshold","282545960_Optimize_the_Signal_Quality_of_the_Composite_Health_Index_Via_Data_Fusion_for_Degradation_Modeling_and_Prognostic_Analysis","282000915_Dynamic_Coordinated_Condition-Based_Maintenance_for_Multiple_Components_With_External_Conditions","280560510_An_Improved_Exponential_Model_for_Predicting_Remaining_Useful_Life_of_Rolling_Element_Bearings","273789667_A_new_class_of_Wiener_process_models_for_degradation_analysis","271335651_Condition-Based_Maintenance_using_the_Inverse_Gaussian_Degradation_Model","266750283_Rejoinder_to_'Stochastic_modelling_and_analysis_of_degradation_for_highly_reliable_products'","262976200_A_Residual_Storage_Life_Prediction_Approach_for_Systems_With_Operation_State_Switches","260632896_An_Optimal_Age_Replacement_Policy_for_Multi-State_Systems","260632874_Evaluation_and_Comparison_of_Mixed_Effects_Model_Based_Prognosis_for_Hard_Failure","260524191_Estimating_Remaining_Useful_Life_With_Three-Source_Variability_in_Degradation_Modeling","259272960_A_Generalized_Result_for_Degradation_Model-Based_Reliability_Estimation","258805388_A_Wiener-process-based_degradation_model_with_a_recursive_filter_algorithm_for_remaining_useful_life_estimation","257392248_Investigation_of_uncertainty_treatment_capability_of_model-based_and_data-driven_prognostic_methods_using_simulated_data","257196072_Degradation-based_burn-in_with_preventive_maintenance","242786849_Optimal_Replacement_Policy_for_MultiState_System_Under_Imperfect_Maintenance","232405671_Particle_filtering_prognostic_estimation_of_the_remaining_useful_life_of_nonlinear_components","220590538_Modified_Two-Stage_Degradation_Model_for_Dynamic_Maintenance_Threshold_Calculation_Considering_Uncertainty","220590466_Minimize_Production_Loss_in_Device_Testing_via_Condition-Based_Equipment_Maintenance","220170318_Optimal_Replacement_in_the_Proportional_Hazards_Model_With_Semi-Markovian_Covariate_Process_and_Continuous_Monitoring","3490087_Automated_reliability_life_data_analysis_of_missiles_in_storage_and_flight"]}
