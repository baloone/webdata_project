{"id":"335604671_Tile2Vec_Unsupervised_Representation_Learning_for_Spatially_Distributed_Data","abstract":"Geospatial analysis lacks methods like the word vector representations and pre-trained networks that significantly boost performance across a wide range of natural language and computer vision tasks. To fill this gap, we introduce Tile2Vec, an unsupervised representation learning algorithm that extends the distributional hypothesis from natural language — words appearing in similar contexts tend to have similar meanings — to spatially distributed data. We demonstrate empirically that Tile2Vec learns semantically meaningful representations for both image and non-image datasets. Our learned representations significantly improve performance in downstream classification tasks and, similarly to word vectors, allow visual analogies to be obtained via simple arithmetic in the latent space.","authors":["Neal Jean","Sherrie Wang","Anshul Samar","George Azzari"],"meta":["July 2019Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence 33:3967-3974","DOI:10.1609/aaai.v33i01.33013967"],"references":["326496783_Infrastructure_Quality_Assessment_in_Africa_using_Satellite_Imagery_and_Deep_Learning","306885833_Densely_Connected_Convolutional_Networks","319770439_Efficient_Estimation_of_Word_Representations_in_Vector_Space","319770355_Generative_Adversarial_Nets","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","311611060_Context_Encoders_Feature_Learning_by_Inpainting","311609041_Deep_Residual_Learning_for_Image_Recognition","308277657_Shuffle_and_Learn_Unsupervised_Learning_Using_Temporal_Order_Verification","308277283_Unsupervised_Learning_of_Visual_Representations_by_Solving_Jigsaw_Puzzles","306300024_Combining_satellite_imagery_and_machine_learning_to_predict_poverty"]}
