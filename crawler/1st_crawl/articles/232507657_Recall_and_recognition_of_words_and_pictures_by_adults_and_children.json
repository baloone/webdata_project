{"id":"232507657_Recall_and_recognition_of_words_and_pictures_by_adults_and_children","abstract":"Recall and recognition performance were compared under 3 different modes of presentation (written words, black-and-white pictures of objects, and color pictures of objects) for 15 male and 15 female Ss in each of 3 grade levels (college students, 6th graders, and 4th graders). Results show a developmental trend of increasing recall performance with age. Whereas adult performance was significantly affected by mode of presentation (color pictures > black-and-white pictures > written words), no difference was found across presentation modes for the 4th and 6th graders. However, the data also indicate that children do have pictorial and color cues available in memory in a manner very similar to adults. It is suggested that the cognitive structures of children do not utilize this stimulus information. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)","authors":["Marilyn A.
