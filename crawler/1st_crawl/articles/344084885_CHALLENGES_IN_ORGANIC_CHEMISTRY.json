{"id":"344084885_CHALLENGES_IN_ORGANIC_CHEMISTRY","abstract":"Since \"chemistry\" has become the central core molecular science for energy, environment, sustainability, materials, biology, and medicine, great challenges in \"organic chemistry\" reflect more or less the same trend. In addition, advances in computing capacity and capabilities have opened avenues for big data treatment and analysis, systems chemistry, accurate simulations and predictions. Accordingly, it would be safe to say that the great challenges and successes in organic chemistry would reside at the interface with energy, environment, sustainability, materials, biology, medicine, and computer science. Now, let's move on to the examples of great challenges in branches of organic chemistry.","authors":["Vellimineti Ramakrishna"],"meta":["September 2020"],"references":["13952650_Comparison_of_the_DNA_Association_Kinetics_of_the_Lac_Repressor_Tetramer_Its_Dimeric_Mutant_LacI_adi_and_the_Native_Dimeric_Gal_Repressor","5283544_The_Protein_Folding_Problem","318393853_Solar_Engineering_of_Thermal_Processes","230678193_Microbial_engineering_for_the_production_of_advanced_Biofuels"]}
