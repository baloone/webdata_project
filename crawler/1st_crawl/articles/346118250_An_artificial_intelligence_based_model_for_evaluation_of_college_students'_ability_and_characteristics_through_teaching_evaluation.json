The constructing scientific and reasonable teaching quality evaluation system is the key of teaching quality evaluation. This paper takes the quality of graduates as the core content, establishes a results-oriented teaching quality evaluation system in colleges and universities, and finds that the academic level of graduates and the level of competition in career selection are two quantitative dimensions reflecting the quality of graduates. Based on this, this paper establishes the evaluation model of the developmental potential index and gives the reference of the norm of teaching effect evaluation for self-evaluation. Finally, this paper discusses the components of graduate quality and the way to construct the evaluation system.","authors":["Bin Li","Yanying Fei","Hui Liu"],"meta":["October 2020Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems 40(1):1-11","DOI:10.3233/JIFS-189378"],"references":["330835011_Can_autism_be_catered_with_artificial_intelligence-assisted_intervention_technology_A_comprehensive_survey","324361764_An_Automatic_Tamil_Speech_Recognition_system_by_using_Bidirectional_Recurrent_Neural_Network_with_Self-Organizing_Map","354632847_Attitude_of_University_Students_and_Teachers_towards_Instructional_Role_of_Artificial_Intelligence","339621373_Designing_the_Framework_of_Evaluation_on_Learner's_Cognitive_Skill_for_Artificial_Intelligence_Education_through_Computational_Thinking","337383527_Detection_of_flood_disaster_system_based_on_IoT_big_data_and_convolutional_deep_neural_network","330102938_Neural_Network_Based_Brain_Tumor_Detection_Using_Wireless_Infrared_Imaging_Sensor","329832252_Survey_on_Spatial_Data_Mining_Challenges_and_Its_Applications","312437263_Teacher_Evaluation_Archiving_Teaching_Effectiveness","285629525_Teaching_evaluation_as_a_contested_practice_Teacher_resistance_to_teaching_evaluation_schemes_in_Norway","245686604_Collaborative_Learning_Techniques_A_Handbook_for_College_Faculty"]}
