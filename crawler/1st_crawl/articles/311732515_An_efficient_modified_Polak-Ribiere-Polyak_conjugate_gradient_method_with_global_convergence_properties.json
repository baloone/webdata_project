{"id":"311732515_An_efficient_modified_Polak-Ribiere-Polyak_conjugate_gradient_method_with_global_convergence_properties","abstract":"The conjugate gradient (CG) method is one of the most popular methods for solving large-scale unconstrained optimization problems. In this paper, a new modified version of the CG formula that was introduced by Polak, Ribi√®re, and Polyak is proposed for problems that are bounded below and have a Lipschitz-continuous gradient. The new parameter provides global convergence properties when the strong Wolfe-Powell (SWP) line search or the weak Wolfe-Powell (WWP) line search is employed. A proof of a sufficient descent condition is provided for the SWP line search. Numerical comparisons between the proposed parameter and other recent CG modifications are made on a set of standard unconstrained optimization problems. The numerical results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed CG parameter compared with the other CG parameters.","authors":["Ahmad Alhawarat","Zabidin Salleh","Mustafa Mamat","Mohd Rivaie"],"meta":["December 2016","DOI:10.1080/10556788.2016.1266354"],"references":["260752875_A_Modified_Hestenes-Stiefel_Conjugate_Gradient_Algorithm_for_Large-Scale_Optimization","249011467_Note_on_the_nonlinear_conjugate_gradient_method","313181074_Functional_minimization_by_conjugate_gradients","277707803_Wiley_Encyclopedia_of_Operations_Research_and_Management_Science","268020656_The_Limited_Memory_Conjugate_Gradient_Method","265681369_Nonlinear_programming_computational_methods","262206238_A_modified_Polak-Ribi'ere-Polyak_descent_method_for_unconstrained_optimization","251797447_A_new_three_term_conjugate_gradient_method_for_unconstrained_optimization","246965155_Nonconvex_minimization_calculations_and_the_conjugate_gradient_method","244473392_Note_sur_la_Convergence_de_Methodes_de_Directions_Conjugees","243096479_Global_Convergence_Properties_of_Conjugate_Gradient_Methods_for_Optimization","243784541_A_derivation_of_conjugate-gradients","238845167_Global_convergence_of_the_Fletcher-Reeves_algorithm_with_inexact_line_search","236588190_Reeves_CM_Function_Minimization_by_Conjugate_Gradients_Computer_Journal_7_149-154","228389054_A_survey_of_nonlinear_conjugate_gradient_method"]}
