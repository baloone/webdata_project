{"id":"262222203_Partitions_which_are_simultaneously_t_1_and_t_2_-core","abstract":"For a positive integer t, a partition is t-core if each of the hook numbers from its Ferrers-Young diagram is not divisible by t. For two relatively prime t values, say t1 and t2, there are only finitely many partitions which are both t1- and t2-core. Moreover, the number of partitions has a nice combinatorial representation.","authors":["Jaclyn Anderson"],"meta":["April 2002Discrete Mathematics 248(1-3):237-243","DOI:10.1016/S0012-365X(01)00343-0","Sourcedx.doi.org"],"references":["2553581_4-Core_Partitions_And_Class_Numbers","267164861_Derivation_of_a_New_Formula_for_the_Number_of_Minimal_Lattice_Paths_From_00_to_kmkn_Having_Just_t_Contacts_with_the_Line_mynx_and_Having_No_Points_Above_This_Line_and_a_Proof_of_Grossman's_Formula_for","243769755_Lattice_Path_Counting_and_Applications","220077888_Rook_Theory_andt-Cores","44506871_The_Representation_Theory_of_the_Symmetric_Group","37408209_The_Theory_of_Partitions","27293892_The_Representation_Theory_of_Symmetric_Groups"]}
