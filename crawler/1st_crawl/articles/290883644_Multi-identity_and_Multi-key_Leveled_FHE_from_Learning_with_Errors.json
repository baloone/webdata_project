{"id":"290883644_Multi-identity_and_Multi-key_Leveled_FHE_from_Learning_with_Errors","abstract":"Gentry, Sahai and Waters recently presented the first (leveled) identity-based fully homomorphic (IBFHE) encryption scheme (CRYPTO 2013). Their scheme however only works in the single-identity setting; that is, homomorphic evaluation can only be performed on ciphertexts created with the same identity. In this work, we extend their results to the multi-identity setting and obtain a multi-identity IBFHE scheme that is selectively secure in the random oracle model under the hardness of Learning with Errors (LWE). We also obtain a multi-key fully-homomorphic encryption (FHE) scheme that is secure under LWE in the standard model. This is the first multi-key FHE based on a well-established assumption such as standard LWE. The multi-key FHE of López-Alt, Tromer and Vaikuntanathan (STOC 2012) relied on a non-standard assumption, referred to as the Decisional Small Polynomial Ratio assumption.","authors":["Michael Clear","Ciarán McGoldrick"],"meta":["August 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-3-662-48000-7_31","Conference: Annual Cryptology Conference"],"references":["308358823_Generating_shorter_bases_for_hard_random_lattices","304611453_Candidate_Indistinguishability_Obfuscation_and_Functional_Encryption_for_All_Circuits","304373854_Fully_homomorphic_encryption_with_relatively_small_key_and_ciphertext_sizes","288952811_Identity-based_encryption_from_the_Weil_pairing_extended_abstract","277329536_Bootstrappable_Identity-Based_Fully_Homomorphic_Encryption","277329295_Bootstrappable_Identity-Based_Fully_Homomorphic_Encryption","267441252_Homomorphic_Encryption_from_Learning_with_Errors_Conceptually-Simpler_Asymptotically-Faster_Attribute-Based","261022132_Candidate_Indistinguishability_Obfuscation_and_Functional_Encryption_for_all_Circuits","241623672_On-the-fly_multiparty_computation_on_the_cloud_via_multikey_fully_homomorphic_encryption","241461039_Advances_in_Cryptology_-_EUROCRYPT_2010","227099814_Bonsai_Trees_or_How_to_Delegate_a_Lattice_Basis","225671744_Identity-Based_Encryption_from_the_Weil_Pairing","225168161_Efficient_Lattice_HIBE_in_the_Standard_Model","221591873_Trapdoors_for_hard_lattices_and_new_cryptographic_constructions","221591366_Fully_Homomorphic_Encryption_Using_Ideal_Lattices","221591132_On_Lattices_Learning_with_Errors_Random_Linear_Codes_and_Cryptography","221499260_Efficient_Fully_Homomorphic_Encryption_from_Standard_LWE","221355251_Fully_Homomorphic_Encryption_from_Ring-LWE_and_Security_for_Key_Dependent_Messages","221355101_Lattice_Basis_Delegation_in_Fixed_Dimension_and_Shorter-Ciphertext_Hierarchical_IBE","221348156_Bonsai_Trees_or_How_to_Delegate_a_Lattice_Basis","221326992_Functional_Encryption_for_Inner_Product_Predicates_from_Learning_with_Errors","220994283_Generating_Shorter_Bases_for_Hard_Random_Lattices","220963113_An_Identity_Based_Encryption_Scheme_Based_on_Quadratic_Residues","220898281_Generating_Hard_Instances_of_the_Short_Basis_Problem","220431624_On_lattices_learning_with_errors_random_linear_codes_and_cryptography","220335581_Trapdoors_for_Lattices_Simpler_Tighter_Faster_Smaller","220335489_V_Fully_Homomorphic_Encryption_over_the_Integers","220333796_How_to_Delegate_a_Lattice_Basis"]}
