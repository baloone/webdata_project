{"id":"289103703_Integrated_production_scheduling_and_periodic_maintenances_on_a_single_machine_with_release_dates","abstract":"This paper addresses the production scheduling problem on a single machine with periodic maintenances, where the jobs' release dates are considered. For the resumable case, we prove that the problem can be solved in polynomial time. For the non-resumable case, we prove that the problem is strongly NP-Hard and propose an effective heuristic ERD-LPT based on the properties of optimal solutions. Then a branch-and-bound algorithm (B&B) that utilizes several dominance rules is developed to search the optimal schedules for the small-to-medium sized problems. Computational results indicate that the proposed heuristic is highly accurate compared with B&B and the improvement of performance is significant compared with the First-in-First-out (FIFO) rule.","authors":["Wei-Wei Cui","Zhiqiang Lu"],"meta":["August 2014","DOI:10.1109/CoASE.2014.6899350"],"references":["3449054_New_Hybrid_Optimization_Algorithms_for_Machine_Scheduling_Problems","273888236_Efficient_branch-and-bound_algorithm_for_minimizing_the_weighted_sum_of_completion_times_on_a_single_machine_with_one_availability_constraint","236975291_A_branch_and_bound_algorithm_for_single-machine_production_scheduling_integrated_with_preventive_maintenance_planning","229621297_Scheduling_of_Single_Machine_to_Minimize_Total_Weighted_Completion_Time_Subject_to_Release_Dates","223379853_Scheduling_deteriorating_jobs_on_a_single_machine_with_release_times","223282282_An_improved_approximation_algorithm_for_the_single_machine_total_completion_time_scheduling_problem_with_availability_constraints","222555115_Single-machine_scheduling_with_periodic_and_flexible_periodic_maintenance_to_minimize_maximum_tardiness","222378571_Improved_algorithms_for_two_single_machine_scheduling_problems","221985956_Minimizing_number_of_tardy_jobs_on_a_single_machine_subject_to_periodic_maintenance","220512011_Scheduling_a_maintenance_activity_to_minimize_total_weighted_completion-time","220471004_Minimizing_total_completion_time_on_a_single_machine_with_a_flexible_maintenance_activity","220470271_Branch-and-bound_method_for_minimizing_the_weighted_completion_time_scheduling_problem_on_a_single_machine_with_release_dates","220469792_Minimizing_the_number_of_tardy_jobs_in_a_single-machine_scheduling_problem_with_periodic_maintenance","27411517_Single-machine_scheduling_with_periodic_maintenance_to_minimize_makespan"]}
