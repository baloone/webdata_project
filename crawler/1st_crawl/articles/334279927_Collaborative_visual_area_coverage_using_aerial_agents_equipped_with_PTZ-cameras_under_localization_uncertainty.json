{"id":"334279927_Collaborative_visual_area_coverage_using_aerial_agents_equipped_with_PTZ-cameras_under_localization_uncertainty","abstract":"Mobile Aerial Agents (MAAs) using localization-sensors suffer from their inherent localization uncertainty. These MAAs are equipped with Pan-Tilt-Zoom (PTZ) cameras and thru their 3D-altitude and camera parameters control survey the area underneath them. For a larger convex area, the MAAs transmit to their neighbors their PTZ and altitude parameters. Using a Voronoi-free area tessellation framework and a gradient scheme, a collaborative control framework is provided to maximize the covered area. Simulation studies are offered to investigate the effectiveness of the suggested scheme.","authors":["Nikolaos Bousias","Sotiris Papatheodorou","Mariliza Tzes","Anthony Tzes"],"meta":["June 2019","DOI:10.23919/ECC.2019.8795665","Conference: European Control Conference 2019At: Naples"],"references":["312431609_Distributed_area_coverage_control_with_imprecise_robot_localization_Simulation_and_experimental_studies","329013902_Voronoi-Based_Coverage_Control_of_PanTiltZoom_Camera_Networks","325656616_Visual_Area_Coverage_by_Heterogeneous_Aerial_Agents_under_Imprecise_Localization","322673618_Cooperative_visual_convex_area_coverage_using_a_tessellation-free_strategy","319327413_Real-Time_Area_Coverage_and_Target_Localization_Using_Receding-Horizon_Ergodic_Exploration","313316102_Adapting_to_sensing_and_actuation_variations_in_multi-robot_coverage","311492443_Collaborative_Visual_Area_Coverage","309346141_Distributed_Coverage_Estimation_and_Control_for_Multirobot_Persistent_Tasks","305869777_A_sensor_coverage_game_with_improved_efficiency_guarantees","294723094_C-OPT_Coverage-Aware_Trajectory_Optimization_Under_Uncertainty"]}
