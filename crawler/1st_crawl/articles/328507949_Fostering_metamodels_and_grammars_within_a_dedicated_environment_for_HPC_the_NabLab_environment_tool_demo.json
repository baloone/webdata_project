{"id":"328507949_Fostering_metamodels_and_grammars_within_a_dedicated_environment_for_HPC_the_NabLab_environment_tool_demo","abstract":"Advanced and mature language workbenches have been proposed in the past decades to develop Domain-Specific Languages (DSL) and rich associated environments. They all come in various flavors, mostly depending on the underlying technological space (e.g., grammarware or modelware).\nHowever, when the time comes to start a new DSL project, it often comes with the choice of a unique technological space which later bounds the possible expected features.\nIn this tool paper, we introduce NabLab, a full-fledged industrial environment for scientific computing and High Performance Computing (HPC), involving several metamodels and grammars.\nBeyond the description of an industrial experience of the development and use of tool-supported DSLs, we report in this paper our lessons learned, and demonstrate the benefits from usefully combining metamodels and grammars in an integrated environment.","authors":["Beno√Æt Lelandais","Marie-Pierre Oudot","Benoit Combemale"],"meta":["October 2018","DOI:10.1145/3276604.3276620","Conference: the 11th ACM SIGPLAN International Conference"],"references":["306010456_Modane_A_Design_Support_Tool_for_Numerical_Simulation_Codes","277902778_MDE_in_Practice_for_Computational_Science","277553595_Improving_Performance_Portability_and_Exascale_Software_Productivity_with_the_Numerical_Programming_Language","271704228_A_Computational_Science_Agenda_for_Programming_Language_Research","221223629_Improving_Scalability_and_Maintenance_of_Software_for_High-Performance_Scientific_Computing_by_Combining_MDE_and_Frameworks","209196716_A_Component_Architecture_for_High-Performance_Scientific_Computing","327005099_SE_in_ES_opportunities_for_software_engineering_and_cloud_computing_in_environmental_science","323506196_Saiph_Towards_a_DSL_for_High-Performance_Computational_Fluid_Dynamics","264922652_EMF_Eclipse_Modeling_Framework_20_2nd_Edition","263470643_Model-Driven_Approach_for_Supporting_the_Mapping_of_Parallel_Algorithms_to_Parallel_Computing_Platforms","261212974_Legion_Expressing_locality_and_independence_with_logical_regions","261024507_Towards_Domain-Specific_Computing_for_Stencil_Codes_in_HPC","234806414_The_Arcane_development_framework","228950693_Neptune_A_Domain_Specific_Language_for_Deploying_HPC_Software_on_Cloud_Platforms"]}
