{"id":"341409436_Adaptive_Control_-The_Model_Reference_Approach","abstract":"The design of high performance control systems requires in many cases the use of adaptive control techniques in order to accommodate large uncertainties of the plant models. Among various alternative approaches the technique known as Model Reference Adaptive Systems (MRAS) offer one of the most feasible approaches for the practical implementation of adaptive control systems.\nThe book presents a detailed coverage of various types of model reference adaptive systems, corresponding design methods and applications to relevant situations. Both continuous time and discrete time model reference adaptive system are discussed. The presentation covers the use of these designs for adaptive model following control, on-line and real-time systems identification and adaptive state observation as well as implementation aspects and case studies. Basic concepts on stability, positive dynamic systems and hyperstability used in the book, are reviewed in the appendices.","authors":["Ioan Dor√© Landau"],"meta":["May 2020","Publisher: Marcel Dekker","Project: Adaptive Control"],"references":[]}
