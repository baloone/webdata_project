{"id":"313809654_Post-Prognostics_Decision_Making_in_Distributed_MEMS-Based_Systems","abstract":"In this paper, the problem of using prognostics information of Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) for post-prognostics decision in distributed MEMS-based systems is addressed. A strategy of post-prognostics decision is proposed and then implemented in a distributed MEMS-based conveying surface. The surface is designed to convey fragile and tiny micro-objects. The purpose is to use the prognostics results of the used MEMS in the form of Remaining Useful Life (RUL) to maintain as long as possible a good performance of the conveying surface. For that, a distributed algorithm for distributed decision making in dynamic conditions is proposed. In addition, a simulator to simulate the decision in the targeted system is developed. Simulation results show the importance of the post-prognostics decision to optimize the utilization of the system and improve its performance.","authors":["Haithem Skima","Christophe Varnier","Eugen Dedu","Kamal Medjaher"],"meta":["March 2019Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing 30(4)","DOI:10.1007/s10845-017-1312-8"],"references":["317930047_Random_Forests_for_Industrial_Device_Functioning_Diagnostics_Using_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","312456975_Data-driven_prognostic_method_based_on_Bayesian_approaches_for_direct_remaining_useful_life_prediction","299639941_A_Post-Prognostics_Decision_Approach_to_Optimize_the_Commitment_of_Fuel_Cell_Systems_in_Stationary_Applications","289975733_A_testbed_for_real-time_autonomous_vehicle_PHM_and_contingency_management_applications","282952217_Design_modeling_and_control_of_a_modular_contactless_wafer_handling_system","305495348_A_Hybrid_Prognostics_Approach_for_MEMS_from_Real_Measurements_to_Remaining_Useful_Life_Estimation","304054317_Optimal_Path_Evolution_in_a_Dynamic_Distributed_MEMS-Based_Conveyor","298789541_Optimal_Path_Evolution_in_a_Dynamic_Distributed_MEMS-based_Conveyor","289042323_A_real_options_optimization_model_to_meet_availability_requirements_for_offshore_wind_turbines","286294538_An_approach_to_prognostic_decision_making_in_the_aerospace_domain","282325489_PHM_Based_Predictive_Maintenance_Optimization_for_Offshore_Wind_Farms","279956781_Random_Forests_for_Industrial_Device_Functioning_Diagnostics_UsingWireless_Sensor_Networks","271918671_An_Energy_and_Memory-Efficient_Distributed_Self-reconfiguration_for_Modular_SensorRobot_Networks","266476069_Adaptive_Load-Allocation_for_Prognosis-Based_Risk_Management","269074969_New_Variable_Health_Threshold_Based_on_the_Life_Observed_for_Improving_the_Scheduled_Maintenance_of_a_Wind_Turbine"]}
