{"id":"337419828_Green_manufacturing_Order_acceptance_and_scheduling_subject_to_the_budgets_of_energy_consumption_and_machine_launch","abstract":"This paper investigates an order acceptance and scheduling problem with an energy consumption budget, a machine launch budget, and the order release time in a green manufacturing system. The phenomenon of deteriorating jobs is considered in the production of the accepted orders. The objective of the study is to maximize the net revenue and a modified variable neighborhood search (MVNS) Algorithm that combines a novel encoding and decoding procedure as well as a dynamic programming algorithm is developed to solve it. To show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm, we first employ the MVNS algorithm and seven VNS-based algorithms to solve the problems with different configurations of orders and machines. The results show that the MVNS algorithm obtains better solutions than existing VNS-based algorithms. Then, the proposed algorithm is compared with three meta-heuristic algorithms. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has significant advantages in terms of solution optimality.","authors":["Min Kong","Jun Pei","Xinbao Liu","Pei-Chun Lai"],"meta":["November
