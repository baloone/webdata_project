Traditional bioinformatics tools cannot cope with\nthe rate of production of such huge amount of data. So, new\ntools need to be developed and existing tools need to be\nimproved. New researchers, developers and Bioinformaticists\nface difficulty in selecting the appropriate tool for Analysis of\ndata or for making improvements in the tools. This paper\npresents a comprehensive survey on the availability of\nbioinformatics tools, purpose of different tools, programming\nlanguages used for development of different tools and data\nformats used for different tools. It also presents either a tool\nhas been enhanced to be used on Big Data platform or not.","authors":["Atif Sarwar","Abbas Rehman","Javed Ferzund"],"meta":["December 2016International Journal of Computer Science and Information Security, Vol. 14(No. 12):12"],"references":["267415392_Relaxed_Synchronization_and_Eager_Scheduling_in_MapReduce","263745283_Developing_eThread_Pipeline_Using_SAGA-Pilot_Abstraction_for_Large-Scale_Structural_Bioinformatics","262844133_CloudDOE_A_User-Friendly_Tool_for_Deploying_Hadoop_Clouds_and_Analyzing_High-Throughput_Sequencing_Data_with_MapReduce","262225282_Alignment-Annotator_web_server_Rendering_and_annotating_sequence_alignments","258396241_An_Overview_of_Multiple_Sequence_Alignments_and_Cloud_Computing_in_Bioinformatics","256451863_DistMap_A_Toolkit_for_Distributed_Short_Read_Mapping_on_a_Hadoop_Cluster","275114055_GenomeVISTA--an_integrated_software_package_for_whole-genome_alignment_and_visualization","268881486_From_FastQ_Data_to_High-Confidence_Variant_Calls_The_Genome_Analysis_Toolkit_Best_Practices_Pipeline","258422158_RALEE_--_RNA_ALignment_editor_in_Emacs","254038525_Maestro_Replica-Aware_Map_Scheduling_for_MapReduce"]}
