{"id":"330656280_NeoTag_a_POS_Tagger_for_Grammatical_Neologism_Detection","abstract":"POS Taggers typically fail to correctly tag grammatical neologisms: for a known word, most taggers will only take known tags into account, and hence discard the possibility that that word is used in a novel or deviant grammatical category in a new text. Grammatical neologisms are relatively rare, and therefore do not pose a significant problem for the overall performance of a tagger. But for studies on neologisms and grammaticalization processes, this makes traditional taggers rather unfit. This article describes a modified POS tagger that explicitly considers new tags for known words, hence making it better fit for neologism research. This tagger, called NeoTag, has an overall accuracy that is comparable to other taggers, but scores much better for grammatical neologisms. To achieve this, the tagger applies a system of lexical smoothing, which adds new categories to known words based on known homographs. NeoTag also lemmatizes words as part of the tagging system, achieving a high accuracy on lemmatization for both known and unknown words, without the need for an external lexicon. The use of NeoTag is not restricted to grammatical neologism detection, and it can be used for other purposes as well.","authors":["Maarten Janssen"],"meta":["January 2012","Conference: The eighth international conference on Language Resources and EvaluationAt: Istanbul, Turkey"],"references":["228970350_NeoTrack-Un_analyseur_de_neologismes_en_ligne","228772280_Open_Source_Lexical_Information_Network","307174896_An_Empirical_Study_of_Smoothing_Techniques_for_Language_Modeling","230876319_Part_of_Speech_Assignment_by_a_Statistical_Decision_Algorithm","220875255_An_Empirical_Study_of_Smoothing_Techniques_for_Language_Modeling","215470768_Probabilistic_Part-of-Speech_Tagging_Using_Decision_Trees","3178307_Estimation_of_probabilities_from_sparse_data_for_the_language_model_component_of_a_speech_recognizer"]}
