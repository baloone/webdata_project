{"id":"298900455_A_Load_Balancing_Technique_for_Efficient_Survivable_Multicasting_in_Mesh_Optical_Networks","abstract":"The current paper deals with the problem of survivable multicasting in mesh optical networks. A load balancing technique is presented that can be combined with any appropriate survivable multicast algorithm. Simulations on several test networks have shown that the proposed technique outperforms the conventional methods as it efficiently intersperses the network load, as well as keeps low the percentage of highly congested arcs at each network state, thus decreasing the blocking ratio for the newly arriving multicast requests.","authors":["Costas K.
