Fifty-two students participated in two online courses. The students in each course were divided into two groups: the experimental group, which participated in a structured discussion forum, and the control group, which participated in an unstructured discussion forum. The questionnaire used for data collection consisted of closed and open-ended questions. The results revealed that the attitudes towards the use of discussion forums of students who participated in the structured discussion forum were positive compared to the attitudes of students who participated in the unstructured discussion forum. Based on the results of the study, the researcher suggests some appropriate recommendations.","authors":["Moanes H.
