{"id":"280104860_Software_Use_in_Astronomy_an_Informal_Survey","abstract":"We report on an informal survey about the use of software in the worldwide\nastronomical community. The survey was carried out between December 2014 and\nFebruary 2015, collecting responses from 1142 astronomers, spanning all career\nlevels. We find that all participants use software in their research. The vast\nmajority of participants, 90%, write at least some of their own software. Even\nthough writing software is so wide-spread among the survey participants, only\n8% of them report that they have received substantial training in software\ndevelopment. Another 49% of the participants have received \"little\" training.\nThe remaining 43% have received no training. We also find that astronomers'\nsoftware stack is fairly narrow. The 10 most popular tools among astronomers\nare (from most to least popular): Python, shell scripting, IDL, C/C++, Fortran,\nIRAF, spreadsheets, HTML/CSS, SQL and Supermongo. Across all participants the\nmost common programing language is Python ($67\\pm 2\\%$), followed by IDL\n($44\\pm 2\\%$), C/C++ ($37\\pm 2\\%$) and Fortran ($28\\pm 2\\%$). IRAF is used\nfrequently by $24\\pm 1\\%$ of participants. We show that all trends are largely\nindependent of career stage, area of research and geographic location.","authors":["Ivelina Momcheva","Erik Jon Tollerud"],"meta":["July 2015","SourcearXiv"],"references":[]}
