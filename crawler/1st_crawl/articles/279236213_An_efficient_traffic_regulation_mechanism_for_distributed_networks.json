{"id":"279236213_An_efficient_traffic_regulation_mechanism_for_distributed_networks","abstract":"The increasing customer base has been posing a challenging situation for the existing Internet architecture that cannot be used for efficiently handling the massively growing demands with respect to optimal channel capacity and traffic congestion controls. The paper has reviewed all the major significant congestion control techniques on various types of network and found that there are only few studies focusing on controlling traffic congestion on distributed networks. Therefore, this paper introduces a technique to control packet level congestion in distributed network by adopting a novel metric termed as stochastic rate control. The paper showcases an algorithm for implementing traffic rate control to ensure the balanced rate of data flow in highly distributed network. The outcome of the study has been assessed using throughput, channel capacity, and delay to find that the proposed system outperforms the existing system of congestion control.","authors":["R.Selvarani Rangasamy","Vinodha Krishnareddy"],"meta":["December 2015EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking 2015(1)","DOI:10.1186/s13638-015-0386-2"],"references":["275118543_CDC_Compressive_Data_Collection_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","261524570_A_new_congestion_control_algorithm_for_Datagram_Congestion_Control_Protocol_DCCP_based_real-time_multimedia_applications","319477641_EDAL_An_energy-efficient_delay-aware_and_lifetime-balancing_data_collection_protocol_for_heterogeneous_wireless_sensor_networks","313534903_Service_Configuration_and_Distribution_in_Composite_Radio_Environments","286437624_Effective_Congestion_Avoidance_Scheme_for_Mobile_Ad_Hoc_Networks","273397078_Reliable_Multicast_with_Pipelined_Network_Coding_Using_Opportunistic_Feeding_and_Routing","272393174_Physarum_Optimization_A_Biology-Inspired_Algorithm_for_the_Steiner_Tree_Problem_in_Networks","266413592_Congestion_control_and_QOS_improvement_for_AEERG_protocol_in_MANET","265388934_A_Biology-Based_Algorithm_to_Minimal_Exposure_Problem_of_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","261524496_An_Energy-Efficient_Position_Based_Clustering_Protocol_for_Wireless_Sensor_Network_Using_Round_Robin_Scheduling_Technique"]}
