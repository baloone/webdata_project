{"id":"282299416_Hiding_Secret_Information_Using_LSB_Based_Audio_Steganography","abstract":"Audio signals have a characteristic redundancy and unpredictable nature that make them ideal to be used as a cover to hide secret information. A Steganographic technique for embedding text information in audio using LSB based algorithm is presented in this paper. In the proposed method each audio sample is converted into bits and then the text data is embedded. In embedding process, first the message character is converted into its equivalent binary. By using proposed LSB based algorithm, the capacity of stego system to hide the text increases. The performance of the proposed algorithm is computed using SNR values for various audio input.","authors":["Anu Binny","Maddulety Koilakuntla"],"meta":["April 2015","DOI:10.1109/ISCMI.2014.24"],"references":["257879532_Speech_steganography_using_wavelet_and_Fourier_transforms","233841827_A_review_of_audio_based_steganography_and_digital_watermarking","224110375_A_secure_audio_steganography_approach","4015549_Audio_steganography_using_bit_modification","256993966_A_Robust_Audio_Watermarking_Scheme_Based_on_Lifting_Wavelet_Transform_and_Singular_Value_Decomposition","252044631_An_enhanced_least_significant_bit_modification_technique_for_audio_steganography","252027814_Secure_data_transmission_using_video_Steganography","224503229_Reduced_complexity_enhancement_of_steganalysis_of_LSB-matching_image_steganography","224453573_A_unified_audio_and_image_steganography_by_spectrum_modification","223031059_An_adaptive_audio_watermarking_based_on_the_singular_value_decomposition_in_the_wavelet_domain","222539104_A_robust_digital_audio_watermarking_based_on_statistics_characteristics","220348438_Increasing_Robustness_of_LSB_Audio_Steganography_by_Reduced_Distortion_LSB_Coding","4235817_A_Secure_Image_Steganography_using_LSB_DCT_and_Compression_Techniques_on_Raw_Images","3455290_Steganalysis_of_Embedding_in_Two_Least-Significant_Bits"]}
