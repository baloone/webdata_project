{"id":"264437530_Sustainable_behaviour_at_work_and_in_private_life_The_contribution_of_enterprises","abstract":"The overall issue of the research presented is to use the workplace for achieving a more sustainable and climate aware behaviour of employees. Research on sustainable consumption indicate that the workplace is a suitable setting to organise daily practices and behavioural routines in a more sustainable and climate friendly manner. An integrated view has been taken in concrete company settings. It brought a first understanding about sustainable provisions offered by companies, mutual learning about sustainability issues at work and spillover into private life. So far companies have predominantly engaged in reducing emissions in their production and service processes. This project aims at raising awareness of companies regarding their contribution towards green transition by motivating their employees. Although scientific research has fairly underpinned the importance of the work-place as context for behavioural change, this is one of the first empirical works to prove the theoretical concept.","authors":["Manfred Klade","Wilma Mert","Ulrike Seebacher","Irmgard Schultz"],"meta":["January 2013International Journal of Innovation and Sustainable Development 7(4):321 - 332","DOI:10.1504/IJISD.2013.057035"],"references":["275638627_Motivating_Sustainable_Consumption_A_Review_of_Evidence_on_Consumer_Behaviour_and_Behavioural_Change","266569555_Making_Pro-Environmental_Behaviour_Work_An_Ethnographic_Case_Study_of_Practice_Process_and_Power_in_the_Workplace","232890955_Downsizing_rightsizing_or_dumbsizing_Quality_human_resources_and_the_management_of_sustainability","227620122_Live_Better_by_Consuming_Less_Is_There_a_Double_Dividend_in_Sustainable_Consumption","40124443_Sustainable_Consumption_A_Theoretical_and_Environmental_Policy_Perspective","303056179_The_limited_autonomy_of_the_consumer_Implications_for_sustainable_consumption","289328795_Work-related_consumption_drivers_and_consumption_at_work","277185159_Forderung_des_nachhaltigen_Konsums_von_Mitarbeitern","263564662_Exploring_the_Social_Dynamics_of_Proenvironmental_Behavior_Change_A_Comparative_Study_of_Intervention_Processes_at_Home_and_Work","248588033_A_Cognitive_Dissonance_Interpretation_of_Consistencies_and_Inconsistencies_in_Environmentally_Responsible_Behavior","228268499_The_Impacts_of_Household_Consumption_and_Options_for_Change","227628235_Consumption_and_the_Rebound_Effect_An_Industrial_Ecology_Perspective","227486909_Green_Work-Life_Balance_A_New_Perspective_for_Green_HRM","225261242_Companies_Promoting_Sustainable_Consumption_of_Employees","223910326_New_technology_in_everyday_life_-_Social_processes_and_environmental_impact","222538814_Willing_Consumers_-_or_Locked-in_Policies_for_Sustainable_Consumption","222414260_The_role_of_business_in_sustainable_consumption","47717411_Protecting_the_planet_and_its_people_How_do_interventions_to_promote_environmental_sustainability_and_occupational_safety_and_health_overlap"]}
