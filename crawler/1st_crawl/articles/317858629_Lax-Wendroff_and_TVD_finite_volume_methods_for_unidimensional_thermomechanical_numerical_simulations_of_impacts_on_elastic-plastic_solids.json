First, an extension of Lax–Wendroff to elastic–plastic constitutive models with linear and nonlinear hardenings is presented. Second, a high order TVD method based on flux-difference splitting [1] and Superbee flux limiter [2] is coupled with an approximate elastic–plastic Riemann solver for nonlinear hardenings, and follows that of Fogarty [3] for linear ones. Thermomechanical coupling is accounted for through dissipation heating and thermal softening, and adiabatic conditions are assumed. This paper essentially focuses on one-dimensional problems since analytical solutions exist or can easily be developed. Accordingly, these two numerical methods are compared to analytical solutions and to the explicit finite element method on test cases involving discontinuous and continuous solutions. This allows to study in more details their respective performance during the loading, unloading and reloading stages. Particular emphasis is also paid to the accuracy of the computed plastic strains, some differences being found according to the numerical method used. Lax–Wendoff two-dimensional discretization of a one-dimensional problem is also appended at the end to demonstrate the extensibility of such numerical scheme to multidimensional problems.\n\nFull text available at https://authors.elsevier.com/a/1VIOF508HaeEI","authors":["Thomas Heuzé"],"meta":["June 2017Journal of Computational Physics 346","DOI:10.1016/j.jcp.2017.06.027"],"references":["260085455_Continuum_thermodynamics_ASME","260085182_Sur_les_Materiaux_Standard_Generalises","227934686_An_Eulerian_finite-volume_scheme_for_large_elastoplastic_deformations_in_solids","225476665_Partition_of_plastic_work_into_heat_and_stored_energy_in_metals","285919574_Foundations_of_Stress_Waves","285423901_Methods_of_computational_physics","281102261_An_upwind_vertex_centred_Finite_Volume_solver_for_Lagrangian_solid_dynamics","278638241_Riemann_Solvers_and_Numerical_Methods_for_Fluid_Dynamics","271713403_Parametric_modeling_of_an_electromagnetic_compression_device_with_the_proper_generalized_decomposition","267210022_Multi-solid_and_multi-fluid_diffuse_interface_model_Applications_to_dynamic_fracture_and_fragmentation","267008735_Fundamental_methods_in_hydrodynamics","266982923_Elements_of_Continuum_Mechanics_and_Conservation_Laws","260666269_Numerical_simulation_of_elastic-plastic_solid_mechanics_using_an_Eulerian_stretch_tensor_approach_and_HLLD_Riemann_solver","256919086_Development_of_a_cell_centred_upwind_finite_volume_algorithm_for_a_new_conservation_law_formulation_in_structural_dynamics","250692545_Vectorization_techniques_for_explicit_Arbitrary_Lagrangian-Eulerian_calculations","245285061_Mechanics_of_Solid_Material","236646908_A_nominally_second-order_cell-centered_Lagrangian_scheme_for_simulating_elastic-plastic_flows_on_two-dimensional_unstructured_grids","229327779_Electromagnetic_forming-A_review","228780449_A_Conservative_Eulerian_Numerical_Scheme_for_Elastoplasticity_and_Application_to_Plate_Impact_Problems","224010913_Finite_Volume_Methods_for_Hyperbolic_Systems","222820592_An_Eulerian_hybrid_WENO_centered-difference_solver_for_elastic-plastic_solids","222524160_A_High-Order_Eulerian_Godunov_Method_for_Elastic-Plastic_Flow_in_Solids","222486231_Computational_methods_in_Lagrangian_and_Eulerian_hydrocodes_Comput_Methods_Appl_Mech_Eng_992-3235-394","222144421_On_electromagnetic_forming_processes_in_finitely_strained_solids_Theory_and_examples","51992536_High_Resolution_Schemes_Using_Flux_Limiters_for_Hyperbolic_Conservation_Laws","37427363_Nonlinear_Finite_Elements_For_Continua_and_Structures","33517248_Finite_volume_methods_for_acoustics_and_elasto-plasticity_with_damage_in_a_heterogeneous_medium","2423631_A_Conservative_Formulation_For_Plasticity"]}
