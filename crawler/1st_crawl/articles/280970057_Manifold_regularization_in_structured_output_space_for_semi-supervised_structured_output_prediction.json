{"id":"280970057_Manifold_regularization_in_structured_output_space_for_semi-supervised_structured_output_prediction","abstract":"Structured output prediction aims to learn a predictor to predict a\nstructured output from a input data vector. The structured outputs include\nvector, tree, sequence, etc. We usually assume that we have a training set of\ninput-output pairs to train the predictor. However, in many real-world appli-\ncations, it is difficult to obtain the output for a input, thus for many\ntraining input data points, the structured outputs are missing. In this paper,\nwe dis- cuss how to learn from a training set composed of some input-output\npairs, and some input data points without outputs. This problem is called semi-\nsupervised structured output prediction. We propose a novel method for this\nproblem by constructing a nearest neighbor graph from the input space to\npresent the manifold structure, and using it to regularize the structured out-\nput space directly. We define a slack structured output for each training data\npoint, and proposed to predict it by learning a structured output predictor.\nThe learning of both slack structured outputs and the predictor are unified\nwithin one single minimization problem. In this problem, we propose to mini-\nmize the structured loss between the slack structured outputs of neighboring\ndata points, and the prediction error measured by the structured loss. The\nproblem is optimized by an iterative algorithm. Experiment results over three\nbenchmark data sets show its advantage.","authors":["Fei Jiang","Lili Jia","Xiaobao Sheng","Riley LeMieux"],"meta":["August 2015Neural Computing and Applications 27(8)","DOI:10.1007/s00521-015-2029-2","SourcearXiv"],"references":["280722293_Towards_Scalable_Distributed_Workload_Manager_with_Monitoring-Based_Weakly_Consistent_Resource_Stealing","274199899_Cutting-Plane_Matheuristic_for_Service_Network_Design_with_Design-Balanced_Requirements","273693397_Manifold_Learning_for_Multivariate_Variable-Length_Sequences_With_an_Application_to_Similarity_Search","271943923_Extended_cutting_plane_method_for_a_class_of_nonsmooth_nonconvex_MINLP_problems","270163806_Fusion_of_Local_Manifold_Learning_Methods","267567583_Optimizing_Load_Balancing_and_Data-Locality_with_Data-aware_Scheduling","265645845_Augmenting_Image_Descriptions_Using_Structured_Prediction_Output","265046374_Structured_Output_Prediction_of_Novel_Enzyme_Function_with_Reaction_Kernels","257870619_Mathematical_modeling_and_stability_analysis_of_macrophage_activation_in_left_ventricular_remodeling_post-myocardial_infarction","233534717_Multiple_graph_regularized_protein_domain_ranking","228441721_An_EM-based_Multi-Step_Piecewise_Surface_Regression_Learning_Algorithm","221602128_Data_Mining_of_Mass_Storage_Based_on_Cloud_Computing","221465277_An_Empirical_Study_on_Using_the_National_Vulnerability_Database_to_Predict_Software_Vulnerabilities","221344889_Semi-supervised_learning_for_structured_output_variables","221336266_Structured_Output_Prediction_of_Anti-cancer_Drug_Activity","220605579_Collective_Classification_in_Network_Data_Articles","220320388_Large_Margin_Methods_for_Structured_and_Interdependent_Output_Variables","215990336_Support_Vector_Machine_Learning_for_Interdependent_and_Structured_Output_Spaces","304292849_Multiple_Kernel_Multivariate_Performance_Learning_Using_Cutting_Plane_Algorithm","287425602_High_order_regularization_for_semi-supervised_learning_of_structured_output_problems","286725365_An_Effective_Image_Representation_Method_Using_Kernel_Classification","281312689_Multiple_kernel_multivariate_performance_learning_using_cutting_plane_algorithm","279633337_Representing_Data_by_Sparse_Combination_of_Contextual_Data_Points_for_Classification","276365660_Visible-NIR_reflectance_spectroscopy_and_manifold_learning_methods_applied_to_the_detection_of_fungal_infections_on_citrus_fruit","276170408_Fault_diagnosis_method_of_joint_fisher_discriminant_analysis_based_on_local_and_global_manifold_learning_and_its_kernel_version","275958629_A_supervised_machine-learning_approach_towards_geochemical_predictive_modelling_in_archaeology","275958536_A_supervised_machine-learning_approach_towards_geochemical_predictive_modelling_in_archaeology","272368582_Transforming_collaborative_filtering_into_supervised_learning","271532825_Reciprocal_Recommendation_System_for_Online_Dating","270968250_Optimal_power_flow_of_a_distribution_system_based_on_increasingly_tight_cutting_planes_added_to_a_second_order_cone_relaxation","270913309_A_new_cut-and-solve_and_cutting_plane_combined_approach_for_the_capacitated_lane_reservation_problem","266658622_Next_generation_job_management_systems_for_extreme-scale_ensemble_computing","264673495_An_Evasion_and_Counter-Evasion_Study_in_Malicious_Websites_Detection","262426354_Cross-layer_detection_of_malicious_websites","262353414_Joint_learning_and_weighting_of_visual_vocabulary_for_bag-of-feature_based_tissue_classification","262317301_Automated_Segmentation_of_Cerebral_Aneurysms_Based_on_Conditional_Random_Field_and_Gentle_Adaboost","261151445_Discriminative_structured_outputs_prediction_model_and_its_efficient_online_learning_algorithm","228371481_Maximum_margin_semi-supervised_learning_for_structured_variables","225126487_Structured_Output_Prediction_with_Support_Vector_Machines","221362554_SUN_database_Large-scale_scene_recognition_from_abbey_to_zoo","221303774_Structured_Output_Ordinal_Regression_for_Dynamic_Facial_Emotion_Intensity_Prediction","221013030_Semi-Supervised_Structured_Output_Learning_Based_on_a_Hybrid_Generative_and_Discriminative_Approach","220964046_Multiple_Classifier_Method_for_Structured_Output_Prediction_Based_on_Error_Correcting_Output_Codes"]}
