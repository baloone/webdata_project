{"id":"274403697_Beyond_Short_Snippets_Deep_Networks_for_Video_Classification","abstract":"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been extensively applied for image\nrecognition problems giving state-of-the-art results on recognition, detection,\nsegmentation and retrieval. In this work we propose and evaluate several deep\nneural network architectures to combine image information across a video over\nlonger time periods than previously attempted. We propose two methods capable\nof handling full length videos. The first method explores various convolutional\ntemporal feature pooling architectures, examining the various design choices\nwhich need to be made when adapting a CNN for this task. The second proposed\nmethod explicitly models the video as an ordered sequence of frames. For this\npurpose we employ a recurrent neural network that uses Long Short-Term Memory\n(LSTM) cells which are connected to the output of the underlying CNN. Our best\nnetworks exhibit significant performance improvements over previously published\nresults on the Sports 1 million dataset (73.1% vs. 60.9%) and the UCF-101\ndatasets with (88.6% vs. 87.9%) and without additional optical flow information\n(82.6% vs. 72.8%).","authors":["Joe Ng","Matthew Hausknecht","Sudheendra Vijayanarasimhan","Oriol Vinyals"],"meta":["March 2015","SourcearXiv"],"references":["305196650_Going_deeper_with_convolutions","265787949_Going_Deeper_with_Convolutions","261524984_Better_Exploiting_Motion_for_Better_Action_Recognition","248964741_A_Duality_Based_Approach_for_Realtime_TV-L1_Optical_Flow","233815759_UCF101_A_Dataset_of_101_Human_Actions_Classes_From_Videos_in_The_Wild","221620711_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","221620610_Offline_Arabic_Handwriting_Recognition_with_Multidimensional_Recurrent_Neural_Networks","221345753_A_Theoretical_Analysis_of_Feature_Pooling_in_Visual_Recognition","221111664_HMDB51_A_Large_Video_Database_for_Human_Motion_Recognition","220320057_Learning_Precise_Timing_with_LSTM_Recurrent_Networks","24213728_A_Novel_Connectionist_System_for_Unconstrained_Handwriting_Recognition","13853244_Long_Short-term_Memory","5583935_Learning_long-term_dependencies_with_gradient_descent_is_difficult","1920244_Phoneme_recognition_in_TIMIT_with_BLSTM-CTC","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","310752533_Visualizing_and_understanding_convolutional_networks","288623601_Towards_end-to-end_speech_recognition_with_recurrent_neural_networks","286594438_Large-Scale_Video_Classification_with_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","283259046_Sequential_Deep_Learning_for_Human_Action_Recognition","267960550_ImageNet_Classification_with_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","262974436_Two-Stream_Convolutional_Networks_for_Action_Recognition_in_Videos","262320131_Action_Recognition_with_Improved_Trajectories","258818168_Speech_Recognition_with_Deep_Recurrent_Neural_Networks","224929589_LSTM-Modeling_of_Continuous_Emotions_in_an_Audiovisual_Affect_Recognition_Framework","224641240_A_Combined_LSTM-RNN_-_HMM_-_Approach_for_Meeting_Event_Segmentation_and_Recognition","221361842_Learning_Realistic_Human_Actions_from_Movies","221346417_3D_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_Human_Action_Recognition","221259353_Evaluation_of_Local_Spatio-temporal_Features_for_Action_Recognition","221078505_Action_Classification_in_Soccer_Videos_with_Long_Short-Term_Memory_Recurrent_Neural_Networks","51025101_Action_Recognition_by_Dense_Trajectories"]}
