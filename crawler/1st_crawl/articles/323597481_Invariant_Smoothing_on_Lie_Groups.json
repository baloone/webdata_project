{"id":"323597481_Invariant_Smoothing_on_Lie_Groups","abstract":"In this paper we propose a (non-linear) smoothing algorithm for group-affine observation systems, a recently introduced class of estimation problems on Lie groups that bear a particular structure. As most non-linear smoothing methods, the proposed algorithm is based on a maximum a posteriori estimator, determined by optimization. But owing to the specific properties of the considered class of problems, the involved linearizations are proved to have a form of independence with respect to the current estimates, leveraged to avoid (partially or sometimes totally) the need to relinearize. The method is validated on a robot localization example, both in simulations and on real experimental data.","authors":["Paul Chauchat","Axel Barrau","Silv√®re Bonnabel"],"meta":["March 2018","Project: Invariant Kalman filtering"],"references":["321953519_Invariant_Kalman_Filtering","321810256_Unscented_Kalman_filtering_on_Lie_groups","312120454_SVO_Semidirect_Visual_Odometry_for_Monocular_and_Multicamera_Systems","288995305_From_Intrinsic_Optimization_to_Iterated_Extended_Kalman_Filtering_on_Lie_Groups","286513661_On-Manifold_Preintegration_for_Real-Time_Visual-Inertial_Odometry","283117924_An_EKF-SLAM_algorithm_with_consistency_properties","334144207_Linear_observed_systems_on_groups","322672026_A_geometric_nonlinear_observer_for_simultaneous_localisation_and_mapping","311842293_SE-Sync_A_Certifiably_Correct_Algorithm_for_Synchronization_over_the_Special_Euclidean_Group","308277408_Online_Variational_Bayesian_Motion_Averaging","267789033_Bayesian_Fusion_on_Lie_Groups","266560636_The_Invariant_Extended_Kalman_Filter_as_a_Stable_Observer","273314220_Continuous-Discrete_Extended_Kalman_Filter_on_Matrix_Lie_Groups_Using_Concentrated_Gaussian_Distributions","271549643_Robust_estimation_of_rotations_from_relative_measurements_by_maximum_likelihood","262881736_Associating_Uncertainty_With_Three-Dimensional_Poses_for_Use_in_Estimation_Problems"]}
