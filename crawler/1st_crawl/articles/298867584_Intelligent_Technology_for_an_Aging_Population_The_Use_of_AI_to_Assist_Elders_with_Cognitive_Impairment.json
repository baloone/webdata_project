{"id":"298867584_Intelligent_Technology_for_an_Aging_Population_The_Use_of_AI_to_Assist_Elders_with_Cognitive_Impairment","abstract":"Today, approximately 10 percent of the world's population is over the age of 60; by 2050 this proportion will have more than doubled. Moreover, the greatest rate of increase is amongst the \"oldest old,\" people aged 85 and over. While many older adults remain healthy and productive, overall this segment of the population is subject to physical and cognitive impairment at higher rates than younger people. This article surveys new technologies that incorporate artificial intelligence techniques to support older adults and help them cope with the changes of aging, in particular with cognitive decline.","authors":["M.E.
