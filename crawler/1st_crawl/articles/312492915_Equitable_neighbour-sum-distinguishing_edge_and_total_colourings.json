{"id":"312492915_Equitable_neighbour-sum-distinguishing_edge_and_total_colourings","abstract":"With any (not necessarily proper) edge $k$-colouring $\\gamma:E(G)\\longrightarrow\\{1,\\dots,k\\}$ of a graph $G$,one can associate a vertex colouring $\\sigma\\_{\\gamma}$ given by $\\sigma\\_{\\gamma}(v)=\\sum\\_{e\\ni v}\\gamma(e)$.A neighbour-sum-distinguishing edge $k$-colouring is an edge colouring whose associated vertex colouring is proper.The neighbour-sum-distinguishing index of a graph $G$ is then the smallest $k$ for which $G$ admitsa neighbour-sum-distinguishing edge $k$-colouring.These notions naturally extends to total colourings of graphs that assign colours to both vertices and edges.We study in this paper equitable neighbour-sum-distinguishing edge colourings andtotal colourings, that is colourings $\\gamma$ for whichthe number of elements in any two colour classes of $\\gamma$ differ by at most one.We determine the equitable neighbour-sum-distinguishing indexof complete graphs, complete bipartite graphs and forests,and the equitable neighbour-sum-distinguishing total chromatic numberof complete graphs and bipartite graphs.","authors":["Olivier Baudon","Monika Pilsniak","Jakub Przybylo","Mohammed Senhaji"],"meta":["January 2017Discrete Applied Mathematics 222(1)","DOI:10.1016/j.dam.2017.01.031","Project: PICS CNRS GraphPar"],"references":["265368257_Proof_of_a_conjecture_of_P_Erdos","302316284_The_Equitable_Coloring_of_Graphs","279648201_On_a_1_2_conjecture","266960317_On_a_12_conjecture","265956312_Vertex-coloring_Edge-weightings_of_Graphs","242793334_Edge_weights_and_vertex_colors","231746351_A_Short_Proof_of_the_Hajnal-Szemeredi_Theorem_on_Equitable_Colouring","228689265_Equitable_Coloring_of_Graphs","226963348_On_vertex-coloring_13-edge-weighting","222679264_Vertex-Coloring_2-Edge-Weighting_of_Graphs"]}
