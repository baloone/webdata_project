{"id":"5202061_Graphs_and_Cooperation_in_Games","abstract":"Graph-theoretic ideas are used to analyze cooperation structures in games. Allocation rules, selecting a payoff for every possible cooperation structure, are studied for games in characteristic function form. Fair allocation rules are defined, and these are proven to be unique, closely related to the Shapley value, and stable for a wide class of games.","authors":["Roger Myerson"],"meta":["October 1976Mathematics of Operations Research 2(3)","DOI:10.1287/moor.2.3.225","SourceRePEc"],"references":["242911560_Solutions_for_Four-Person_Games_in_Partition_Function_Form","228108188_A_Simplified_Bargaining_Model_for_the_N-Person_Cooperative_Game","228108105_A_value_for_n-person_games","226335741_Cooperative_Games_with_Coalition_Structures"]}
