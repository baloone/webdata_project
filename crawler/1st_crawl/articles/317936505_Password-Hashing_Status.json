{"id":"317936505_Password-Hashing_Status","abstract":"Computers are used in our everyday activities, with high volumes of users accessing provided services. One-factor authentication consisting of a username and a password is the common choice to authenticate users in the web. However, the poor password management practices are exploited by attackers that disclose the usersâ€™ credentials, harming both users and vendors. In most of these occasions the user data were stored in clear or were just processed by a cryptographic hash function. Password-hashing techniques are applied to fortify this user-related information. The standardized primitive is currently the PBKDF2 while other widely-used schemes include Bcrypt and Scrypt. The evolution of parallel computing enables several attacks in password-hash cracking. The international cryptographic community conducted the Password Hashing Competition (PHC) to identify new efficient and more secure password-hashing schemes, suitable for widespread adoption. PHC advanced our knowledge of password-hashing. Further analysis efforts revealed security weaknesses and novel schemes were designed afterwards. This paper provides a review of password-hashing schemes until the first quarter of 2017 and a relevant performance evaluation analysis on a common setting in terms of code size, memory consumption, and execution time.","authors":["George Hatzivasilis"],"meta":["June 2017Cryptography 1(10)","DOI:10.3390/cryptography1020010","Projects: nShieldnSHIELD"],"references":["316597629_Real-time_management_of_railway_CPS","316597501_SecRoute_End-to-End_Secure_Communications_for_Wireless_Ad-hoc_Networks","316078586_A_review_of_lightweight_block_ciphers","306293911_Lightweight_authenticated_encryption_for_embedded_on-chip_systems","303849832_Efficiently_Computing_Data-Independent_Memory-Hard_Functions","314502690_Towards_Practical_Attacks_on_Argon2i_and_Balloon_Hashing","309773971_Balloon_Hashing_A_Memory-Hard_Function_Providing_Provable_Protection_Against_Sequential_Attacks","301670687_On_the_Complexity_of_Scrypt_and_Proofs_of_Space_in_the_Parallel_Random_Oracle_Model","300571459_High_Parallel_Complexity_Graphs_and_Memory-Hard_Functions","300141162_On_Password_Guessing_with_GPUs_and_FPGAs"]}
