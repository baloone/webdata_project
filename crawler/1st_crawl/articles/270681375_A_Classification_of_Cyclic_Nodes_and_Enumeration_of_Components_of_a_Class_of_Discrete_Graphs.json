{"id":"270681375_A_Classification_of_Cyclic_Nodes_and_Enumeration_of_Components_of_a_Class_of_Discrete_Graphs","abstract":"Let Zn be the ring of residue classes modulo n. Define f: Zn ↦ Zn by f(x) = x4. Action of this map is studied by means of digraphs which produce an edge from the residue classes a to b if f (a) = b. For every integer n, an explicit formula is given for the number of fixed points of f. It is shown that the graph G(pk), k ≥ 1 has four fixed points if and only if 3{divides}p-1 and has two fixed points if and only if 3∤p-1. A classification of cyclic vertices of the graph G(pk) has been determined. A complete enumeration of non-isomorphic cycles and components of G(pk) has been explored.","authors":["Muhammad Khalid Mahmood","Farooq Ahmad"],"meta":["January 2015Applied Mathematics & Information Sciences 9(1):103-112","DOI:10.12785/amis/010115"],"references":["267375311_ON_A_DIGRAPH_DEFINED_BY_SQUARING_MODULO_n","324282574_An_Introduction_to_the_Theory_of_Numbers","265546888_A_discrete_iteration_in_number_theory","265546887_Digraphs_from_powers_Modulo_p","240183969_Power_Digraphs_Modulo_p","226367905_On_a_Connection_of_Number_Theory_with_Graph_Theory","223147033_The_graph_of_the_square_mapping_on_the_prime_fields","222543569_On_the_iteration_of_certain_quadratic_maps_over_GFp","220301224_The_quadratic_digraph_on_polynomial_rings_over_finite_fields","220193957_On_symmetric_digraphs_of_the_congruence"]}
