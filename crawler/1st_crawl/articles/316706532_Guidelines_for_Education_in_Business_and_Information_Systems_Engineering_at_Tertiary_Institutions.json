{"id":"316706532_Guidelines_for_Education_in_Business_and_Information_Systems_Engineering_at_Tertiary_Institutions","abstract":"The paper presents guidelines for education in business and information systems engineering (BISE) at tertiary institutions, which were designed by a working group comprising domain experts, both from academia and practice. The guidelines contain the learning outcomes in Bachelor’s and Master’s degree programs, in particular, the key subject-specific, social, and personal skills needed by BISE graduates. Moreover, corresponding occupational profiles, the specific skills required, as well as the essential and typical learning content for BISE education are described. Furthermore, detailed recommendations for the design of Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees curricula and sub-curricula in BISE, business administration, and computer science, respectively, are provided. The presented guidelines serve several purposes. Providing common directions for BISE education is aiming to support personnel in charge of curriculum development and to assist students in program and career choice.","authors":["Reinhard Jung","Christiane Lehrer"],"meta":["May 2017Business & Information Systems Engineering 59(3):189–203","DOI:10.1007/s12599-017-0473-5"],"references":[]}
