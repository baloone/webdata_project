{"id":"341877206_A_modified_transmissibility_indicator_and_Artificial_Neural_Network_for_damage_identification_and_quantification_in_laminated_composite_structures","abstract":"Recently, more attention has been paid to Artificial Neural Network (ANN) in the field of damage identification of engineering structures based on modal analysis. This paper proposes a new modified damage indicator using transmissibility technique to improve Local Frequency Response Ratio (LFCR) combined with ANN. The main objective of the proposed damage indicator is to reduce the number of collecting data used in ANN technique for fast prediction and with higher accuracy instead of collecting modal analysis data, i.e. natural frequencies, damping ratios, and mode shapes, or inverse analysis for damage quantification using optimization techniques. The suggested approach is tested using three layers cross-ply [0°/90°/0°] composite beam and cross-ply [0°/90°/0°] laminated composite plate having multiple and single damage(s). The reliability and accuracy of the proposed application are demonstrated by predicting the severity of damages in composite structures after analysing four damage scenarios.","authors":["Roumaissa Zenzen","Samir Khatir","Idir Belaidi","le thanh cuong"],"meta":["June 2020Composite Structures 248(3):112497","DOI:10.1016/j.compstruct.2020.112497"],"references":["340355250_An_energy_approach_to_the_solution_of_partial_differential_equations_in_computational_mechanics_via_machine_learning_Concepts_implementation_and_applications","334261442_Damage_Detection_in_Laminated_Composite_Plates_Based_on_Local_Frequency_Change_Ratio_Indicator","334261209_Damage_Detection_in_Truss_Structures_Using_Transmissibility_Combined_with_Optimization_Techniques","319531835_Multiple_damage_detection_in_unidirectional_graphite-epoxy_composite_beams_using_particle_swarm_optimization_and_genetic_algorithm","291164803_Damage_detection_and_localization_in_composite_beam_structures_based_on_vibration_analysis","273905876_Detection_of_material_interfaces_using_a_regularized_level_set_method_in_piezoelectric_structures","267568794_TRANSMISSIBILITY_TECHNIQUES_FOR_DAMAGE_DETECTION","267327179_Localization_of_Transversal_Cracks_in_Sandwich_Beams_and_Evaluation_of_Their_Severity","257272117_Damage_localization_using_transmissibility_functions_A_critical_review","243367023_A_generalized_flexibility_matrix_based_approach_for_structural_damage_detection","339465199_Improved_ANN_technique_combined_with_Jaya_algorithm_for_crack_identification_in_plates_using_XIGA_and_experimental_analysis","338138709_Multiple_damage_detection_in_laminated_composite_beams_by_data_fusion_of_Teager_energy_operator-wavelet_transform_mode_shapes","336150531_Damage_assessment_in_composite_laminates_using_ANN-PSO-IGA_and_Cornwell_indicator","335798642_An_efficient_artificial_neural_network_for_damage_detection_in_bridges_and_beam-like_structures_by_improving_training_parameters_using_cuckoo_search_algorithm","332731352_A_Deep_Collocation_Method_for_the_Bending_Analysis_of_Kirchhoff_Plate","332175235_Artificial_Neural_Network_Methods_for_the_Solution_of_Second_Order_Boundary_Value_Problems","328722082_A_damage_identification_technique_for_beam-like_and_truss_structures_based_on_FRF_and_Bat_Algorithm","328093288_Damage_assessment_in_structures_using_combination_of_a_modified_Cornwell_indicator_and_genetic_algorithm","327302873_Structural_Health_Monitoring_of_Beam-Like_and_Truss_Structures_Using_Frequency_Response_and_Particle_Swarm_Optimization_Volume_2_Numerical_Modelling_in_Mechanical_and_Materials_Engineering_NME_2018_28","325780548_A_robust_damage_detection_method_based_on_multi-modal_analysis_in_variable_temperature_conditions","323991688_An_efficient_approach_for_optimal_sensor_placement_and_damage_identification_in_laminated_composite_structures","322389979_Crack_identification_method_in_beam-like_structures_using_changes_in_experimentally_measured_frequencies_and_Particle_Swarm_Optimization","318248145_An_efficient_multi-stage_optimization_approach_for_damage_detection_in_plate_structures","315629177_An_efficient_modal_strain_energy-based_damage_detection_for_laminated_composite_plates","299442714_A_two-step_approach_for_damage_detection_in_laminated_composite_structures_using_modal_strain_energy_method_and_an_improved_differential_evolution_algorithm","274142058_Damage_detection_of_metro_tunnel_structure_through_transmissibility_function_and_cross_correlation_analysis_using_local_excitation_and_measurement","259590697_Relative_scaling_of_mode_shapes_using_transmissibility_functions","252779231_Two_Stages_Damage_Detection_in_Structure_Based_on_Modal_Data","251600415_A_model_for_quantifying_uncertainty_in_the_estimation_of_noise-contaminated_measurements_of_transmissibility","246843007_Modal_Analysis_Theory_and_Testing","243366749_Free_vibration_of_laminated_composite_and_sandwich_plates_using_global-local_higher-order_theory","243364726_Vibration_Analysis_of_circular_Mindlin_plates_using_the_differential_quadrature_method","241098049_Damage_detection_and_quantification_using_transmissibility","236623468_Modal_identification_and_damage_detection_in_beam-like_structures_using_the_power_spectrum_and_time_frequency_analysis","230973826_Efficiency_of_genetic_algorithms_and_artificial_neural_networks_for_evaluating_delamination_in_composite_structures_using_fibre_Bragg_grating_sensors","223576755_Vibration_analysis_of_symmetrically_laminated_plates_based_FSDT_using_the_moving_least_squares_differential_quadrature_method","222931780_Harmonic_reproducing_kernel_particle_method_for_free_vibration_analysis_of_rotating_cylindrical_shells","222863798_A_high_order_collocation_method_for_the_static_and_vibration_analysis_of_composite_plates_using_a_first-order_theory","222359848_Analysis_of_natural_frequencies_of_composite_plates_by_an_RBF-pseudospectral_method"]}
