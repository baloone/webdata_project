{"id":"228648173_Similarity_measures_of_intuitionistic_fuzzy_sets_based_on_Lp_metric","abstract":"A similarity measure is a useful tool for determining the similarity of two objects. Since Atanas-sov [K. Atanassov, Intuitionistic fuzzy sets, Fuzzy Sets and Systems 20 (1986) 87â€“96.] originated the idea of intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs), many different similarity measures between IFSs have been proposed in the literature. In this paper we propose several reasonable measures to calculate the degree of similarity between IFSs, in which the proposed measures are induced by L p metric. Numer-ical examples demonstrate that the proposed similarity measures perform well in pattern recognition problems. Finally, we apply the proposed measures to analyze the behavior of decision making.","authors":["Wen-Liang Hung","Miin-Shen Yang"],"meta":["December 2006International Journal of Approximate Reasoning 46(1)","DOI:10.1016/j.ijar.2006.10.002"],"references":["228418922_Entropy_and_similarity_of_intuitionistic_fuzzy_sets","220868028_A_New_Concept_of_a_Similarity_Measure_for_Intuitionistic_Fuzzy_Sets_and_Its_Use_in_Group_Decision_Making","287711963_Fuzzy_sets_information_and_control","279888990_Theories_and_technologies_of_spatial_data_mining_and_knowledge_discovery","268315155_On_the_relationship_between_intuitionistic_fuzzy_sets_and_some_other_extensions_of_fuzzy_set_theory","268308509_Intuitionistic_fuzzy_logic","265455307_Intuitionistic_fuzzy_sets_Theory_and_applications","256992299_Intuitionistic_Fuzzy_Sets_Fuzzy_Sets_Syst","246076039_Entropy_on_Intuitionistic_Fuzzy_Sets_and_on_Interval-Valued_Fuzzy_Sets","246047271_Elements_of_intuitionistic_fuzzy_logic","242799443_New_Operations_Defined_Over_the_Intuitionistic_Fuzzy_Sets","229209282_Distances_Between_Intuitionistic_Fuzzy_Sets","228832832_Intuitionistic_fuzzy_sets_in_group_decision_making","223671928_Distances_between_intuitionistic_fuzzy_sets_andor_interval-valued_fuzzy_sets_based_on_the_Hausdorff_metric","223267786_Kerre_EE_On_the_Relationship_Between_Some_Extensions_of_Fuzzy_Set_Theory_Fuzzy_Sets_and_Systems_133_227-235","223008643_An_application_of_intuitionistic_fuzzy_sets_in_medical_diagnosis","222848462_On_the_Dengfeng-Chuntian_similarity_measure_and_its_application_to_pattern_recognition","222779449_Similarity_measures_on_intuitionistic_fuzzy_sets","222678257_Terminological_difficulties_in_fuzzy_set_theory-The_case_of_Intuitionistic_Fuzzy_Sets","222532511_Entropy_for_intuitionistic_fuzzy_sets","222481407_Intuitionistic_fuzzy_Prolog","222439366_Fuzzy_Sets","222424803_Hung_WL_Similarity_measures_of_intuitionistic_fuzzy_sets_based_on_Hausdorff_distance_Pattern_Recognition_Letters_25_1603-1611","222160899_Some_notes_on_Atanassov's_intuitionistic_fuzzy_sets","220646319_New_similarity_measures_of_intuitionistic_fuzzy_sets_and_application_to_pattern_recognitions","220645485_Distance_measure_between_intuitionistic_fuzzy_sets","220527510_Answer_to_D_Dubois_S_Gottwald_P_Hajek_J_Kacprzyk_and_H_Prade's_paper_Terminological_difficulties_in_fuzzy_set_theory-the_case_of_Intuitionistic_Fuzzy_Sets","220355127_A_Note_on_Entropy_of_Intuitionistic_Fuzzy_Sets","8331648_A_similarity-based_robust_clustering_method","4113480_A_concept_of_similarity_for_intuitionistic_fuzzy_sets_and_its_use_in_group_decision_making"]}
