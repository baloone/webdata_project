{"id":"351458589_Analysis_of_student_attitude_and_their_acceptance_for_e-Evaluation_during_COVID-19_Implementation_and_Implications","abstract":"This research aimed to promote the electronic evaluation tools to tackle the pandemic implications (corona, COVID-19) and analyze the attitude and their academic acceptance at the level of the female student's in the department of computer science-faculty of computer science and information technology at Jazan University, Saudi Arabia. The students' attitude towards e-assessment tolls has been measured and the main research sample consisted of 40 students' experimental group. A survey is also conducted for assessment of the validity and reliability of research questions with the help of 50 students before implementation. There was a statistically significant difference between the average grades of students in the post-measurement of the tendency towards the electronic evaluation on the experimental groups in favor of the experimental group, at the significance level (0.01). The results also showed a statistically significant difference at the level of significance (0.01) between average scores of students in academic acceptance level on the experimental groups in favor of the experimental group. The findings of this research indicate the achievement of the e-Evaluation Acceptance and highly recommended to propagate the use of electronic evaluation.","authors":["Shakeel Ahmed","Ahmad Shukri Mohd Noor","Wazir Zada Khan","Mohammed Saad Eldin"],"meta":["May 2021Shanghai Ligong Daxue Xuebao/Journal of University of Shanghai for Science and Technology 23(05):57-76"],"references":["324650663_Plasmodium_falciparum_resistance_to_artemisinin-based_combination_therapies_A_sword_of_Damocles_in_the_path_toward_malaria_elimination","305884920_Online_Peer_Assessment_Method_and_Digital_Technologies","303503739_Tertiary_student_attitudes_to_invigilated_online_summative_examinations","281959391_An_Exploration_into_Improving_Examinees'_Acceptance_of_Participation_in_an_Online_Exam","263488269_Sophisticated_tasks_in_e-assessment_What_are_they_and_what_are_their_benefits","227886473_Students'_evaluation_of_the_use_of_onlin_summative_assessment_on_an_undergraduate_financial_accounting_module","227651260_e-Assessment_and_the_student_learning_experience_A_survey_of_student_perceptions_of_e-assessment","6151827_Approaches_to_Evaluation_of_Treatment_Effect_in_Randomised_Clinical_Trials_with_Genomic_Subset"]}
