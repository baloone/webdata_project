{"id":"326582875_Self-Regulated_Learning_in_a_Computer_Programming_Course","abstract":"this article contains an exploratory study on self-regulation by a group of students during a second-year computer programming course (data structures). Self-regulation was measured through the implementation of an instrument that evaluates motivation and learning strategies. From the results of the implementation, the relation between self-regulation and academic performance among the students was studied through a correlation analysis and other multivariate analyses. The results show new empirical pieces of evidence on the role played by self-regulation within the educational context of computer programming, and suggest which combination of factors allows to discriminate the population subgroups between high and low academic performances, according to self-regulated learning variables.","authors":["J.J.
