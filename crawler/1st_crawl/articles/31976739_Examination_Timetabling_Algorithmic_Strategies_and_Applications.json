{"id":"31976739_Examination_Timetabling_Algorithmic_Strategies_and_Applications","abstract":"Examination timetabling is an important operational problem in many schools, colleges and universities. The authors have developed a computerized examination timetabling system called EXAMINE. In this article several algorithmic strategies for this problem are investigated and compared. Computational results are reported on randomly generated problems and on some real problems.","authors":["Michael W.
