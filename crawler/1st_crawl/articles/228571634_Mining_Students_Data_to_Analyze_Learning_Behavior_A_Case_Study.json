{"id":"228571634_Mining_Students_Data_to_Analyze_Learning_Behavior_A_Case_Study","abstract":"Educational data mining concerns with developing methods for discovering knowledge from data that come from educational environment. In this paper we used educational data mining to analyze learning behavior. In our case study, we collected students' data from DataBase course. After preprocessing the data, we applied data mining techniques to discover association, classification, clustering and outlier detection rules. In each of these four tasks, we extracted knowledge that describes students' behavior.","authors":["Alaa Mustafa El-Halees"],"meta":["January 2009"],"references":["242360346_Mining_Associations_Between_Sets_of_Items_in_Massive_Databases","242076740_Mining_Student_Data_Using_Decision_Trees","222815211_Educational_data_mining_A_survey_from_1995_to_2005","292545397_Data_mining_model_for_higher_education_system","290554498_Knowledge_mining_from_student_data","243763385_Scaling_EM_Clustering_to_Large_Databases","242396122_Data_mining_concepts_and_techniques_morgan_kaufmann","228722062_Outlier_Detection_Technique_in_Data_Mining_A_Research_Perspective","222675404_Data_mining_in_course_management_systems_Moodle_case_study_and_tutorial","221995817_Maximum_Likelihood_from_Incomplete_Data_Via_EM_Algorithm"]}
