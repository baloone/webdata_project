{"id":"268056798_Probability_and_Geometry_on_Groups_Lecture_notes_for_a_graduate_course","abstract":"These notes have grown (and are still growing) out of two graduate courses I gave at the University of Toronto, the first in the Fall of 2009, the second in the Spring of 2011. The main goal is to give a self-contained introduction to several interrelated topics of current research interests: the connections between 1) coarse geometric properties of Cayley graphs of infinite groups; 2) the algebraic properties of these groups; and 3) the behaviour of probabilistic processes (most importantly, random walks, harmonic func-tions, and percolation) on these Cayley graphs. I try to be as little abstract as possible, emphasizing examples rather than presenting theorems in their most general forms. I also try to provide guidance to recent research literature. In par-ticular, there are presently over 150 exercises and many open problems that might be accessible to PhD students. It is also hoped that researchers working either in probability or in geometric group theory will find these notes useful to enter the other field.","authors":["GÃ¡bor Pete"],"meta":[],"references":["337591370_A_probabilistic_approach_to_Carne's_bound","268411864_Kazhdan's_Property_T","264957849_Sharp_thresholds_of_graph_properties_and_the_k-SAT_problem","257157471_Automorphisms_of_one-rooted_trees_Growth_circuit_structure_and_acyclicity","246347179_Growth_of_finitely_generated_solvable_groups_and_curvature_of_Riemannian_manifolds","244453964_Analysis_and_Geometry_on_Groups","325868590_Probability_on_trees_and_networks","324767808_Markov_Chains_and_Mixing_Times","316806492_Grundlehren_der_mathematischen_Wissenschaften","313609388_On_the_evolution_of_random_graphs","298904800_Quasi-isometries_and_rigidity_of_solvable_groups","298537378_Topics_in_orbit_equivalence","293158435_Percolation_on_Graphs","287874571_Some_two-dimensional_finite_energy_percolation_processes","285331394_Groups_of_polynomial_growth_and_expanding_maps","271512781_Probability_and_Measure","268496537_Random_Graphs","268019133_Random_Walks_on_Infinite_Graphs_and_Groups","267125283_Random_Schrodinger_Operators","266985602_Random_walks_and_geometry_on_infinite_graphs","266909767_Probability_on_Graphs_Random_Processes_on_Graphs_and_Lattices","266441815_On_Groups_Acting_on_Locally_Finite_Graphs","266362268_Harmonic_forms_with_values_in_locally_constant_Hilbert_bundles","265894791_Probability_Theory_and_Examples","265886447_Chaines_de_Markov_et_inegalites_isoperimetriques_Markov_chains_and_isoperimetric_inequalities","265367416_On_groups_with_full_Banach_mean_value","265353607_Lois_zero_ou_deux_pour_les_processus_de_Markov_Applications_aux_marches_aleatoires","265350313_Automata_dynamical_systems_and_groups","262898597_Group_Cohomology_Harmonic_Functions_and_the_First_L2-Betti_Number","256205295_Free_Subgroups_in_Linear_Groups","253482859_Dynamic_theory_of_growth_in_groups_Entropy_boundaries_examples","248503640_Course_notes_Expander_graphs_and_their_applications","247446314_Scaling_limits_and_super-Brownian_motion","247043127_On_the_Milnor_problem_of_group_growth","246722461_Long_range_estimates_for_Markov_chains","246600875_Kazhdan's_Property_T_and_the_Geometry_of_the_Collection_of_Invariant_Measures","246532649_Introductorary_notes_on_Richard_Thompson''s_groups","246358836_Harmonic_Functions_on_Manifolds","246347177_Growth_of_finitely_generated_solvable_groups","245942755_Discrete_Groups_Expanding_Graphs_and_Invariant_Measures","245523083_Asymptotic_Invariants_of_In_nite_Groups","245097104_A_Survey_on_Spectra_of_infinite_Graphs","244509199_The_in_uence_of_variables_in_product_spaces","243695238_On_Torsion-Free_Groups_with_In_nitely_Many_Ends","242992996_On_an_isoperimetric_inequality_for_infinite_finitely_generated_groups","242396851_A_lower_bound_for_the_smallest_eigenvalue_of_the_Laplacian","242363341_The_critical_probability_of_bond_percolation_on_the_square_lattice_equals_12","242141404_On_Orbit_Equivalence_of_Measure_Preserving_Actions_1","241547983_A_strongly_disordered_spin_glass_and_minimum_spanning_trees","240468953_A_general_Choquet-Deny_theorem_for_nilpotent_groups","240008664_Full_Banach_Mean_Values_on_Countable_groups","239786208_Instability_of_the_Liouville_property_for_quasi-isometric_Riemannian_manifolds_and_reversible_Markov_chains","239489927_Cut_sets_and_normed_cohomology_with_applications_to_percolation","239356070_A_transmutation_formula_for_Markov_chains","239330719_A_note_on_curvature_and_fundamental_group"]}
