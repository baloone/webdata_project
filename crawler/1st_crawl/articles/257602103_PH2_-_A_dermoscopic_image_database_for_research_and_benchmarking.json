{"id":"257602103_PH2_-_A_dermoscopic_image_database_for_research_and_benchmarking","abstract":"The increasing incidence of melanoma has recently promoted the development of computer-aided diagnosis systems for the classification of dermoscopic images. Unfortunately, the performance of such systems cannot be compared since they are evaluated in different sets of images by their authors and there are no public databases available to perform a fair evaluation of multiple systems. In this paper, a dermoscopic image database, called PH(2), is presented. The PH(2) database includes the manual segmentation, the clinical diagnosis, and the identification of several dermoscopic structures, performed by expert dermatologists, in a set of 200 dermoscopic images. The PH(2) database will be made freely available for research and benchmarking purposes.","authors":["Teresa Mendonça","Pedro M Ferreira","Jorge S Marques","André R. S.
