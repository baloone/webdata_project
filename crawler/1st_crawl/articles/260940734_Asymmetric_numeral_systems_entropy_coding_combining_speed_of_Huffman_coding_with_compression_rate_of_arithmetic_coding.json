{"id":"260940734_Asymmetric_numeral_systems_entropy_coding_combining_speed_of_Huffman_coding_with_compression_rate_of_arithmetic_coding","abstract":"The modern data compression is mainly based on two approaches to entropy\ncoding: Huffman (HC) and arithmetic/range coding (AC). The former is\nmuch faster, but approximates probabilities with powers of 2, usually\nleading to relatively low compression rates. The latter uses nearly\nexact probabilities - easily approaching theoretical compression rate\nlimit (Shannon entropy), but at cost of much larger computational cost.\nAsymmetric numeral systems (ANS) is a new approach to accurate entropy\ncoding, which allows to end this trade-off between speed and rate: the\nrecent implementation [1] provides about $50\\%$ faster decoding than HC\nfor 256 size alphabet, with compression rate similar to provided by AC.\nThis advantage is due to being simpler than AC: using single natural\nnumber as the state, instead of two to represent a range. Beside\nsimplifying renormalization, it allows to put the entire behavior for\ngiven probability distribution into a relatively small table: defining\nentropy coding automaton. The memory cost of such table for 256 size\nalphabet is a few kilobytes. There is a large freedom while choosing a\nspecific table - using pseudorandom number generator initialized with\ncryptographic key for this purpose allows to simultaneously encrypt the\ndata. This article also introduces and discusses many other variants of\nthis new entropy coding approach, which can provide direct alternatives\nfor standard AC, for large alphabet range coding, or for approximated\nquasi arithmetic coding.","authors":["Jarek Duda"],"meta":["November 2013","Project: Asymmetric Numeral Systems"],"references":["23962581_Asymmetric_numeral_systems","3308537_Context-based_adaptive_binary_arithmetic_coding_in_the_H264AVC_video_compression_standard","2799801_Practical_Implementations_of_Arithmetic_Coding","2212557_Optimal_encoding_on_discrete_lattice_with_translational_invariant_constrains_using_statistical_algorithms","243776986_Range_encoding_An_algorithm_for_removing_redundancy_from_a_digitised_message","238208163_Context-based_adaptive_binary_arithmetic_coding_in_the_H","225338470_A_method_for_the_construction_of_minimum-redundancy_codes","224104359_Generalized_Kraft_Inequality_and_Arithmetic_Coding","3080229_Asymptotic_average_redundancy_of_Huffman_and_other_block_codes","2851086_The_PAQ1_Data_Compression_Program"]}
