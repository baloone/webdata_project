{"id":"225530209_Block_Sensitivity_of_Weakly_Symmetric_Functions","abstract":"Block sensitivity, which was introduced by Nisan [5], is one of the most useful measures of boolean functions. In this paper we investigate the block sensitivity of weakly symmetric functions (functions invariant under some transitive group action). We prove a Ω(N\n1/3) lower bound for the block sensitivity of weakly symmetric functions. We also construct a weakly symmetric function which has block sensitivity Õ(N\n3/7).","authors":["Xiaoming Sun"],"meta":["May 2006Theoretical Computer Science 384(1):339-344","DOI:10.1007/11750321_32","Sourcedx.doi.org","Conference: Proceedings of the Third international conference on Theory and Applications of Models of Computation"],"references":["4082552_Graph_properties_and_circular_functions_How_low_can_quantum_query_complexity_go","3785039_Quantum_lower_bounds_by_polynomials","2508255_On_the_Degree_of_Boolean_Functions_as_Real_Polynomials","1847267_Lecture_Notes_on_Evasiveness_of_Graph_Properties","301857732_Quantum_Lower_Bounds_by_Polynomials","273559873_CREW_PRAMs_and_decision_trees","222569158_Complexity_measures_and_decision_tree_complexity_A_survey","222448509_On_recognizing_graph_properties_from_adjacency_matrices","221590938_CREW_PRAMs_and_decision_trees","220112053_The_Critical_Complexity_of_Graph_Properties","4150612_On_the_Sensitivity_of_Cyclically-Invariant_Boolean_Functions"]}
