{"id":"231816354_Unconditionally_Secure_Bit_Commitment_by_Transmitting_Measurement_Outcomes","abstract":"We propose a new unconditionally secure bit commitment scheme based on Minkowski causality and the properties of quantum information. The receiving party sends a number of randomly chosen Bennett-Brassard 1984 (BB84) qubits to the committer at a given point in space-time. The committer carries out measurements in one of the two BB84 bases, depending on the committed bit value, and transmits the outcomes securely at (or near) light speed in opposite directions to remote agents. These agents unveil the bit by returning the outcomes to adjacent agents of the receiver. The protocol's security relies only on simple properties of quantum information and the impossibility of superluminal signalling.","authors":["Adrian Kent"],"meta":["September 2012Physical Review Letters 109(13):130501","DOI:10.1103/PhysRevLett.109.130501","SourcePubMed"],"references":["242326397_FAST_TRACK_COMMUNICATION_On_the_conditions_for_discrimination_between_quantum_states_with_minimum_error","228109483_WITHDRAWN_Quantum_cryptography_Public_key_distribution_and_coin_tossing","46584799_Position-Based_Quantum_Cryptography_Impossibility_and_Constructions","45934486_Quantum_Tagging_Authenticating_Location_via_Quantum_Information_and_Relativistic_Signalling_Constraints","45904336_Location-Dependent_Communications_using_Quantum_Entanglement","3593544_A_quantum_bit_commitment_scheme_provably_unbreakable_by_bothparties","2620245_Is_Quantum_Bit_Commitment_Really_Possible","2201608_Unconditionally_Secure_Quantum_Bit_Commitment_is_Impossible","2191381_Superselection_rules_and_quantum_protocols","1736090_Information-Theoretically_Secure_Voting_Without_an_Honest_Majority","235508401_Unconditionally_Secure_Commitment_of_a_Certified_Classical_Bit_is_Impossible","48207777_Location-Oblivious_Data_Transfer_with_Flying_Entangled_Qudits","48194670_Unconditionally_Secure_Bit_Commitment_with_Flying_Qudits","48194662_A_No-summoning_theorem_in_Relativistic_Quantum_Theory","46582290_Quantum_Tagging_for_Tags_Containing_Secret_Classical_Data","23630431_Statistical_decision_theory_for_quantum_systems","3082529_Optimum_Testing_of_Multiple_Hypotheses_in_Quantum_Detection_Theory","2204189_Secure_Classical_Bit_Commitment_Using_Fixed_Capacity_Communication_Channels","2203401_Unconditionally_Secure_Bit_Commitment","2202482_Unconditionally_Secure_Quantum_Bit_Commitment","2201590_Why_quantum_bit_commitment_and_ideal_quantum_coin_tossing_are_impossible","2198533_Reexamination_of_Quantum_Bit_Commitment_the_Possible_and_the_Impossible","2196285_Variable_Bias_Coin_Tossing","2193646_Why_Classical_Certification_is_Impossible_in_a_Quantum_World"]}
