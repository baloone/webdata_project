{"id":"305252912_Slugs_Extensible_GR1_Synthesis","abstract":"Applying reactive synthesis in practice often requires modifications of the synthesis algorithm in order to obtain useful implementations. We present slugs, a generalized reactivity(1) synthesis tool that has a powerful plugin architecture for modifying any aspect of the synthesis process to fit the application. Slugs comes pre-equipped with a variety of plugins that improve the quality of the synthesized solutions along criteria such as quick response, cost-optimality, and error-resilience. We demonstrate the utility and scalability of the tool on an example from robotics.","authors":["RÃ¼diger Ehlers","Vasumathi Raman"],"meta":["July 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-41540-6_18","Conference: International Conference on Computer Aided Verification"],"references":["224588836_Temporal-Logic-Based_Reactive_Mission_and_Motion_Planning","308106886_Synthesizing_cooperative_reactive_mission_plans","301463795_Correct_High-level_Robot_Behavior_in_Environments_with_Unexpected_Events","282924378_Estimator-based_reactive_synthesis_under_incomplete_information","277783711_Timing_Semantics_for_Abstraction_and_Execution_of_Synthesized_High-Level_Robot_Control","273327708_Correct-by-synthesis_reinforcement_learning_with_temporal_logic_constraints","264123014_Low-Effort_Specification_Debugging_and_Analysis","261961208_Resilience_to_intermittent_assumption_violations_in_reactive_synthesis","261353950_Temporal_logic_robot_mission_planning_for_slow_and_fast_actions","261353447_Shortcut_through_an_evil_door_Optimality_of_correct-by-construction_controllers_in_adversarial_environments","215902925_CUDD_CU_decision_diagram_package_release_24_1"]}
