{"id":"331973019_Using_the_CDIO_framework_to_teach_research_methodology_to_informatics_students","abstract":"The conceive, design, implement, operate (CDIO) framework is an extended concept for project-based learning. In considering research as a project, the focus of the study described here was the implementation of CDIO for a research methodology (RM) class. The research reported in this article involved 126 third-year undergraduate students. Over about 16 weeks, to pass the course the students were to write a research proposal for their informatics final project. The proposal was developed based on the CDIO framework. The results were promising; 95% of students were able to develop their research proposals on time. Thus, CDIO has the potential to provide a final project framework for computer science and informatics students.","authors":["Aji Wibawa","Suyono Suyono","A.D.
