{"id":"225707516_Memory_requirements_for_silent_stabilization","abstract":"A stabilizing algorithm is silent if starting from an arbitrary state it converges to a global state after which the values stored in the communication registers\nare fixed. Many silent stabilizing algorithms have appeared in the literature. In this paper we show that there cannot exist\nconstant memory silent stabilizing algorithms for finding the centers of a graph, electing a leader, and constructing a spanning\ntree. We demonstrate a lower bound of bits per communication register for each of the above tasks.","authors":["Shlomi Dolev","Mohamed G.
