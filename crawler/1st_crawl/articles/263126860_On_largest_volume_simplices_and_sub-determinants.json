{"id":"263126860_On_largest_volume_simplices_and_sub-determinants","abstract":"We show that the problem of finding the simplex of largest volume in the\nconvex hull of $n$ points in $\\mathbb{Q}^d$ can be approximated with a factor\nof $O(\\log d)^{d/2}$ in polynomial time. This improves upon the previously best\nknown approximation guarantee of $d^{(d-1)/2}$ by Khachiyan. On the other hand,\nwe show that there exists a constant $c>1$ such that this problem cannot be\napproximated with a factor of $c^d$, unless $P=NP$. % This improves over the\n$1.09$ inapproximability that was previously known. Our hardness result holds\neven if $n = O(d)$, in which case there exists a $\\bar c\\,^{d}$-approximation\nalgorithm that relies on recent sampling techniques, where $\\bar c$ is again a\nconstant. We show that similar results hold for the problem of finding the\nlargest absolute value of a subdeterminant of a $d\\times n$ matrix.","authors":["Marco Di Summa","Friedrich Eisenbrand","Yuri Faenza","Carsten Moldenhauer"],"meta":["June 2014","DOI:10.1137/1.9781611973730.23","SourcearXiv"],"references":["234140252_Approximating_bin_packing_within_Olog_OPTlog_log_OPT_bins","227207237_Approximate_min-max_relations_for_odd_cycles_in_planar_graphs","226406595_Approximability_of_Packing_Disjoint_Cycles","226106032_Approximate_Min-max_Relations_for_Odd_Cycles_in_Planar_Graphs","221591212_Hit-and-Run_from_a_Corner","220589326_On_the_complexity_of_approximating_the_maximal_inscribed_ellipsoid_for_a_polytope","220155615_On_selecting_a_maximum_volume_sub-matrix_of_a_matrix_and_related_problems","51932496_Min-Max_Relations_for_Odd_Cycles_in_Planar_Graphs","45925204_Exponential_Inapproximability_of_Selecting_a_Maximum_Volume_Sub-matrix","45913577_Efficient_Volume_Sampling_for_RowColumn_Subset_Selection","303335206_Six_standard_deviations_suffice","267136661_The_determinant_bound_for_discrepancy_is_almost_tight","265316143_The_largest_subdeterminant_of_a_matrix","254892330_Geometric_Methods_in_Combinatorial_Optimization","243562820_Six_Standard_Deviations_Suffice","242930062_Rounding_of_Polytopes_in_the_Real_Number_Model_of_Computation","234785887_Discrepancy_of_Set-systems_and_Matrices","233815653_The_Geometry_of_Differential_Privacy_the_Sparse_and_Approximate_Cases","225541416_NP-Hardness_of_Largest_Contained_and_Smallest_Containing_Simplices_for_V-_and_H-Polytopes","223717286_On_the_Complexity_of_Some_Basic_Problems_in_Computational_Convexity","222823460_Simulated_annealing_in_convex_bodies_and_an_On4_volume_algorithm","222729954_Metric_Entropy_of_Some_Classes_of_Sets_with_Differentiable_Boundaries","222538811_Packing_triangles_in_bounded_degree_graphs","222489004_On_the_minors_of_an_incidence_matrix_and_its_Smith_normal_form","222180810_Decomposition_of_regular_matroids","221591344_Odd_cycle_packing","220692325_The_Discrepancy_Method_Randomness_and_Complexity","220617483_Hit-and-Run_from_a_Corner","220570044_Polynomial-time_approximation_of_largest_simplices_in_V-polytopes","220453273_NP_-_Hardness_of_Largest_Contained_and_Smallest_Containing_Simplices_for_V-_and_H-Polytopes","220431358_Convex_Separable_Optimization_Is_Not_Much_Harder_than_Linear_Optimization","220345811_Random_Walks_in_a_Convex_Body_and_an_Improved_Volume_Algorithm","220193511_Oracle-polynomial-time_approximation_of_largest_simplices_in_convex_bodies","220190307_On_the_maximum_number_of_independent_edges_in_cubic_graphs","220171828_On_the_Complexity_of_Approximating_Extremal_Determinants_in_Matrices","220137963_Improved_Approximation_Lower_Bounds_on_Small_Occurrence_Optimization","220114830_Parameterized_complexity_and_improved_inapproximability_for_computing_the_largest_j-simplex_in_a_V-polytope","220046187_On_the_Complexity_of_some_Basic_Problems_in_Computational_Convexity_1_Containment_Problems","220046182_Largest_j-Simplices_in_n-Polytopes","216877580_Geometric_Algorithms_and_Combinatorial_Optimization","45900598_Constructive_Algorithms_for_Discrepancy_Minimization","4355297_An_Efficient_Approximation_Scheme_for_the_One-Dimensional_Bin-Packing_Problem","2505506_A_Random_Polynomial_Time_Algorithm_For_Approximating_The_Volume_Of_Convex_Bodies","2493479_Some_optimal_inapproximability_results"]}
