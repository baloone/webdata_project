{"id":"300140101_Towards_Mechanised_Semantics_of_HPC_The_BSP_with_Subgroup_Synchronisation_Case","abstract":"The underlying objective of this article is to exhibit the problems that might be encountered when working on a mechanised semantics of an hpc language. We take for instance a language to program bsp algorithms with subgroup synchronisation à la\nmpi. We give two mechanised semantics using the coq system and prove some common properties. By comparing the sizes of the semantics and proofs, we discuss about the potential scaling problems that would arise if we would like to extend this work to a mainstream language or adding more hpc routines.","authors":["Jean Fortin","Frédéric Gava"],"meta":["November 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-27161-3_20","Conference: International Conference on Algorithms and Architectures for Parallel Processing"],"references":["281530366_Separation_Logic_for_Small-step_Cminor_extended_version","277656433_BSP-Why_A_Tool_for_Deductive_Verification_of_BSP_Algorithms_with_Subgroup_Synchronisation","226611576_Barriers_in_Concurrent_Separation_Logic","279252713_Formal_Semantics_for_the_DRMA_Programming_Style_Subset_of_the_BSPlib_Library","267080261_Mechanized_semantics_With_applications_to_program_proof_and_compiler_verification","265002571_AN_OBJECT-ORIENTED_BULK_SYNCHRONOUS_PARALLEL_LIBRARY_FOR_MULTICORE_PROGRAMMING","262153373_Pretty-Big-Step_Semantics","260329376_An_object-oriented_bulk_synchronous_parallel_library_for_multicore_programming","246877111_MPI_The_Complete_Reference-Volume_1_The_MPI_Core","246814730_Methods_of_BSP_Programming"]}
