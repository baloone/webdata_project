{"id":"288215550_A_new_cognitive_approach_to_measure_the_complexity_of_software's","abstract":"In software industries, the most important parameter is the exact measurement of the effort at the early phase of the software development life cycle. To estimate the effort is difficult due to dynamic behavior of the software. The basic need for this is the clarity in the software requirements like size, complexity of the project, human resource power etc. which is not correctly determined most of time. This paper presents a new cognitive complexity measures named it: New Cognitive Complexity of Program (NCCoP). First, the proposed metric is analytically evaluated against weyuker's property for analyzing its nature and compare its result with other existing cognitive measurement evaluation results. Secondly, perform a comparative study of propose metric with existing metric and the results shows that the proposed cognitive metric do better that others metrics. And attempt has also been made to present the relationship among NCCoP, CFS, CICM, MCCM, and CPCM versus LOC to analyze the behavior of coding efficiency.","authors":["Amit Jakhar","Kumar Rajnish"],"meta":["January 2014International Journal of Software Engineering and its Applications 8(7):185-198","DOI:10.14257/ijseia.2014.8.7,15"],"references":["220423437_Software_Complexity_Measurement","4278379_Cognitive_Program_Complexity_Measure","3186968_Evaluating_software_complexity_measures_IEEE_Trans_Softw_Eng","226974816_Using_Process_Algebra_to_Describe_Human_and_Software_Behaviors","4377886_Software_Measurement_and_Estimation_A_Practical_Approach"]}
