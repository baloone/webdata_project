{"id":"232374031_Map-projection-independent_crater_size-frequency_determination_in_GIS_environments-New_software_tool_for_ArcGIS","abstract":"Statistical analysis of crater size-frequency distributions (CSFDs) of impact craters on planetary surfaces is a well-established method to derive absolute ages on the basis of remotely-sensed image data. Although modelling approaches and the derivation of absolute ages from a given CSFD have been described and discussed in considerable depth since the late 1960s, there is no standardised methodology or guideline for the measurement of impact-crater diameters and area sizes that are both needed to determine absolute ages correctly. Distortions of distances (i.e., diameters) and areas within different map projections are considerable error sources during crater and area measurements.","authors":["Thomas Kneissl","Stephan van Gasselt","G.
