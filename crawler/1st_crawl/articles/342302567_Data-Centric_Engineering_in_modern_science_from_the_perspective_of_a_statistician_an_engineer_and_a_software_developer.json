{"id":"342302567_Data-Centric_Engineering_in_modern_science_from_the_perspective_of_a_statistician_an_engineer_and_a_software_developer","abstract":"Data-Centric Engineering is an emerging branch of science that certainly will take on a leading role in data-driven research. We live in the Big Data era with huge amounts of available data and unseen computing power, and therefore a crafty combination of Statistics (or, in more modern terms, Data Science), Computer Science and Engineering is required to filter out the most important information, master the ever more difficult challenges of a changing world and open new paths. In this paper, we will highlight some of these aspects from a combined perspective of a statistician, an engineer and a software developer. In particular, we will focus on sound data handling and analysis, computational science in Structural Engineering, data care, security and monitoring, and conclude with an outlook on future developments.","authors":["Christophe Ley","Mike Tibolt","Dirk Fromme"],"meta":["June 2020","DOI:10.1017/dce.2020.2"],"references":["322943426_What_makes_Data_Science_different_A_discussion_involving_Statistics20_and_Computational_Sciences","266282081_Comparative_modeling_of_CO_2_laser_cutting_using_multiple_regression_analysis_and_artificial_neural_network","336564435_Anomaly_detection_based_on_automated_OMA_and_mode_shape_changes_application_on_a_historic_arch_bridge","282790946_Statistics_A_data_science_for_the_21st_century","264649865_Structural_health_monitoring_of_the_Tamar_suspension_bridge","261456895_Big_data_A_review","233998051_Recent_perspectives_in_dynamic_testing_and_monitoring_of_bridges","222240989_Online_automatic_identification_of_the_modal_parameters_of_a_long_span_arch_bridge","220693799_Software_Reliability_Principles_and_Practices"]}
