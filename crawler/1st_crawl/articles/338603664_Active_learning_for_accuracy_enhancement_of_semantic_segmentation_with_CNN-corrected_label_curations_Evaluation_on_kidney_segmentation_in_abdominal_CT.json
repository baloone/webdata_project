Recent advances in fully convolutional networks has enabled automatic segmentation; however, high labeling efforts and difficulty in acquiring sufficient and high-quality training data is still a challenge. In this study, a cascaded 3D U-Net with active learning to increase training efficiency with exceedingly limited data and reduce labeling efforts is proposed. Abdominal computed tomography images of 50 kidneys were used for training. In stage I, 20 kidneys with renal cell carcinoma and four substructures were used for training by manually labelling ground truths. In stage II, 20 kidneys from the previous stage and 20 newly added kidneys were used with convolutional neural net (CNN)-corrected labelling for the newly added data. Similarly, in stage III, 50 kidneys were used. The Dice similarity coefficient was increased with the completion of each stage, and shows superior performance when compared with a recent segmentation network based on 3D U-Net. The labeling time for CNN-corrected segmentation was reduced by more than half compared to that in manual segmentation. Active learning was therefore concluded to be capable of reducing labeling efforts through CNN-corrected segmentation and increase training efficiency by iterative learning with limited data.","authors":["Taehun Kim","Kyunghwa Lee","Sungwon Ham","Beomhee Park"],"meta":["January 2020Scientific Reports 10(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-019-57242-9"],"references":["327747905_Active_Deep_Learning_with_Fisher_Information_for_Patch-Wise_Semantic_Segmentation_4th_International_Workshop_DLMIA_2018_and_8th_International_Workshop_ML-CDS_2018_Held_in_Conjunction_with_MICCAI_2018_","325720055_Comparison_of_Different_Classifiers_with_Active_Learning_to_Support_Quality_Control_in_Nucleus_Segmentation_in_Pathology_Images","323879411_Automatic_Semantic_Segmentation_of_Brain_Gliomas_from_MRI_Images_Using_a_Deep_Cascaded_Neural_Network","323796282_An_application_of_cascaded_3D_fully_convolutional_networks_for_medical_image_segmentation","321325183_Cost-Effective_Active_Learning_for_Melanoma_Segmentation","320344644_Interactive_Medical_Image_Segmentation_Using_Deep_Learning_With_Image-Specific_Fine_Tuning","333229625_Region-based_active_learning_for_efficient_labeling_in_semantic_segmentation","330906198_Abstract_nnU-Net_Self-adapting_Framework_for_U-Net-Based_Medical_Image_Segmentation","325521623_Segmentation-by-detection_A_cascade_network_for_volumetric_medical_image_segmentation","320798389_Segmentation-by-Detection_A_Cascade_Network_for_Volumetric_Medical_Image_Segmentation"]}
