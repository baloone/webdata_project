{"id":"343627766_Measurements_of_Acoustical_Parameters_in_the_Ancient_Open-Air_Theatre_of_Tyndaris_Sicily_Italy","abstract":"The emerging field of archaeoacoustics is attracting increasing research attention from scholars of different disciplines: the investigation of the acoustic features of ancient open-air theatres is possibly one of its main themes. In this paper, the outcomes of a measurement campaign of acoustical parameters in accordance with ISO 3382-1 in the ancient theatre of Tyndaris (Sicily) are presented and compared with datasets from other sites. Two sound sources were used (firecrackers and dodecahedron) and their differences were analysed. In general, results show that the Reverberation Time and Strength of Sound values are relatively low when compared with other theatres because of the lack of the original architectural element of the scaenae frons. When combining this effect with the obvious condition of an unroofed space, issues emerge in terms of applicability of the protocols recommended in the ISO standard. This raises the question of whether different room acoustics parameters should be used to characterize open-air ancient theatres.","authors":["Arianna Astolfi","Elena Bo","Francesco Aletta","Louena Shtrepi"],"meta":["August 2020Applied Sciences 10(16):5680","DOI:10.3390/app10165680"],"references":["342684811_Italian-Style_Opera_Houses_A_Historical_Review","342462101_Listeners_Sensitivity_to_Different_Locations_of_Diffusive_Surfaces_in_Performance_Spaces_The_Case_of_a_Shoebox_Concert_Hall","340363040_Geometrical_Acoustic_Simulation_of_Open-air_Ancient_Theatres_Investigation_on_the_Appropriate_Objective_Parameters_for_Improved_Accuracy","339441601_Historical_Acoustics_Relationships_between_People_and_Sound_over_Time","335692693_Review_of_Acoustic_Sources_Alternatives_to_a_Dodecahedron_Speaker","335099010_Sound_Archaeology_A_Study_of_the_Acoustics_of_Three_World_Heritage_Sites_Spanish_Prehistoric_Painted_Caves_Stonehenge_and_Paphos_Theatre","329952570_Performance_Space_Political_Theater_and_Audibility_in_Downtown_Chaco","326998154_The_Accuracy_of_Predicted_Acoustical_Parameters_in_Ancient_Open-Air_Theatres_A_Case_Study_in_Syracusae","343041029_Southern_Italy_ancient_theatres","340914944_Acoustics_of_performance_buildings_in_Hispania_The_Roman_theatre_and_amphitheatre_of_Segobriga_Spain"]}
