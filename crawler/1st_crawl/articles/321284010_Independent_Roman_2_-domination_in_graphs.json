{"id":"321284010_Independent_Roman_2_-domination_in_graphs","abstract":"For a graph G=(V,E), a Roman (2)-dominating function (R2DF) f:V→(0,1,2) has the property that for every vertex vεV with f(v)=0, either there exists an adjacent vertex, a neighbor uεN(v), with f(u)=2, or at least two neighbors x,yεN(v) having f(x)=f(y)=1. The weight of a R2DF is the sum f(V)=∑vεVf(v). A R2DF f=(V0,V1,V2) is called independent if V1∪V2 is an independent set. The independent Roman (2)-domination number i(R2)(G) is the minimum weight of an IR2DF on G. In this paper, we show that the decision problem associated with i(R2)(G) is NP-complete even when restricted to bipartite graphs. Then we show that for every graph G of order n, 0≤ir2(G)-i(R2)(G)≤n/5 and 0≤iR(G)-i(R2)(G)≤n/4, where ir2(G) and iR(G) are the independent 2-rainbow domination and independent Roman domination numbers, respectively. Moreover, we prove that the equality i(R2)(G)=ir2(G) holds for trees.","authors":["Rahmouni Abdelkader","Mustapha Chellali"],"meta":["November 2017Discrete Applied Mathematics 236","DOI:10.1016/j.dam.2017.10.028"],"references":["267478186_Few_compare_to_the_great_Roman_Empire","265574151_Rainbow_domination_in_graphs","45916108_Bounds_on_the_2-rainbow_domination_number_of_graphs","286756680_Roman_2-domination","283106786_Independent_2-rainbow_domination_in_graphs","265590199_Defendens_Imperium_Romanum_A_Classical_Problem_in_Military_Strategy","265552858_Bounds_on_Weak_Roman_and_2-Rainbow_Domination_Numbers","257299510_Bounds_on_the_2-Rainbow_Domination_Number_of_Graphs","256543241_On_2-Rainbow_domination_and_Roman_domination_in_graphs","250804268_Defend_the_Roman_Empire","231512991_On_the_Roman_domination_in_the_lexicographic_product_of_graphs","223427303_Defending_the_Roman_Empire-A_new_strategy","222946187_On_the_2-rainbow_domination_in_graphs","222403633_Roman_domination_in_graphs","220319626_Note_on_2-rainbow_domination_and_Roman_domination_in_graphs","220193567_On_the_well-coveredness_of_Cartesian_products_of_graphs"]}
