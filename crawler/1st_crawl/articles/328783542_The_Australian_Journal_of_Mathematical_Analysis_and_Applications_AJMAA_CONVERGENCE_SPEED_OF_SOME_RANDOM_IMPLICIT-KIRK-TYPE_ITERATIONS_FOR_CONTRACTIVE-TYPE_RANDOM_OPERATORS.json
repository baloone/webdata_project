The rate of convergence of the random iterative schemes are also examined through an example. The results show that our new random implicit kirk multistep scheme perform better than other implicit iterative schemes in terms of convergence and thus have good potentials for further applications in equilibrium problems in computer science, physics and economics.","authors":["Hudson Akewe","Kanayo Stella Eke"],"meta":["October 2018","Project: soft contraction mappings and soft fixed point theorems"],"references":["277915515_On_a_New_Faster_Implicit_Fixed_Point_Iterative_Scheme_in_Convex_Metric_Spaces","267921848_Convergence_and_stability_of_two_random_iteration_algorithms","266833357_On_the_stability_of_some_fixed_point_procedures","262140972_Strong_convergence_and_stability_of_Kirk-multistep-type_iterative_schemes_for_contractive-type_operators","257022275_On_the_Rate_of_Convergence_of_Kirk-Type_Iterative_Schemes","297765004_Some_strong_convergence_results_of_random_iterative_algorithms_with_errors_in_banach_spaces","266988021_On_measurable_relations","257878399_Random_fixed_point_of_Krasnoselskii_type_for_the_sum_of_two_operators","257212372_A_random_fixed_point_iteration_for_three_random_operators_on_uniformly_convex_Banach_spaces","256245420_Random_fixed_point_theorems_with_an_application_to_random_differential_equations_in_Banach_spaces","231819343_On_successive_approximations_for_nonexpansive_mappings_in_Banach_spaces","228378134_Some_stability_results_for_two_hybrid_fixed_point_iterative_algorithms_in_normed_linear_space","246200848_Fixed_point_theorems_in_probabilistic_analysis","238869804_Random_Approximations_and_Random_Fixed_Point_Theorems_for_Non-Self-Maps","233182596_Random_Ishikawa_Iterative_Sequence_with_Applications"]}
