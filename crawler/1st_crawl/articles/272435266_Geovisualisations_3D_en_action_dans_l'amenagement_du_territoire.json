{"id":"272435266_Geovisualisations_3D_en_action_dans_l'amenagement_du_territoire","abstract":"The paper deals with the use of 3D georeferenced representations (3D « geovisualisations ») in flood risks mitigation planning (Plan de Prévention des Risques Inondation - PPRi). Our analysis was conducted from a double theoretical perspective to account for the uses of 3D in real life situations. The first approach focuses on the strategies developed by the various players and on the instrumentalisation of 3D in the competition to control the planning process at the local level. The second, in a more limited way, concentrates on the various interactions between the players and 3D representations throughout the process, analysing how representations as intermediary objects can structure the discussion on flood risks. Having researched both methodologies, we can suggest a pragmatic link between the two in a single case study.","authors":["Florence Jacquinod","Julien Langumier"],"meta":["December 2010Géocarrefour","DOI:10.4000/geocarrefour.8163"],"references":["280748002_Les_figures_du_projet_territorial","305389939_Ces_territorialites_qui_se_dessinent","267922766_Sociologie_de_la_traduction_-_Textes_fondateurs","215484601_La_vie_de_laboratoire_la_production_des_faits_scientifiques"]}
