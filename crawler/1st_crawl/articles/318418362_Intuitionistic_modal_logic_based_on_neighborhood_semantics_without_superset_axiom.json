{"id":"318418362_Intuitionistic_modal_logic_based_on_neighborhood_semantics_without_superset_axiom","abstract":"In this paper we investigate certain systems of propositional logic defned semantically in terms of neighborhood structures. These systems have both intuitionistic and modal aspects. We discuss various restrictions imposed on our models (i.e. on the defnition of neighborhood function) but our constant approach is to discard superset axiom. Such modifcation allows us to think about specifc modalities $\\Delta$ and new functor $\\rightsquigarrow$ depending on the notion of maximal neighborhood. We show how it is possible to treat maximal neighborhoods like topological spaces. Also, we describe properties of bounded morphism, bisimulation and n-bisimulation in our semantics. Finally, we analyze the concept of canonical models.","authors":["Tomasz Witczak"],"meta":["July 2017"],"references":["317026971_Weak_subintuitionistic_logics","283186194_Neighborhood_Semantics_for_Basic_and_Intuitionistic_Logic","264947585_On_neighbourhood_semantics_thirty_years_later","265022445_Negation_from_the_perspective_of_neighborhood_semantics","264910597_Relational_and_neighborhood_semantics_for_intuitionistic_modal_logic","243746824_The_Handbook_of_Contemporary_Semantic_Theory","242403470_Neighborhood_Semantics_for_Modal_Logic_An_Introduction","220284284_Formalizations_for_the_Consequence_Relation_of_Visser's_Propositional_Logic"]}
