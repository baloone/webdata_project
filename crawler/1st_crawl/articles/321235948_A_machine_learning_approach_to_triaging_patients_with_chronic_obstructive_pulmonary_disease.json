{"id":"321235948_A_machine_learning_approach_to_triaging_patients_with_chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease","abstract":"COPD patients are burdened with a daily risk of acute exacerbation and loss of control, which could be mitigated by effective, on-demand decision support tools. In this study, we present a machine learning-based strategy for early detection of exacerbations and subsequent triage. Our application uses physician opinion in a statistically and clinically comprehensive set of patient cases to train a supervised prediction algorithm. The accuracy of the model is assessed against a panel of physicians each triaging identical cases in a representative patient validation set. Our results show that algorithm accuracy and safety indicators surpass all individual pulmonologists in both identifying exacerbations and predicting the consensus triage in a 101 case validation set. The algorithm is also the top performer in sensitivity, specificity, and ppv when predicting a patientâ€™s need for emergency care.","authors":["Sumanth Swaminathan","Klajdi Qirko","Ted Smith","Ethan Corcoran"],"meta":["November 2017PLoS ONE 12(11):e0188532","DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0188532"],"references":["315779698_Can_Machine-learning_improve_cardiovascular_risk_prediction_using_routine_clinical_data","312545820_Prediction_models_for_exacerbations_in_patients_with_COPD","310661054_Home_telemonitoring_for_patients_with_acute_exacerbation_of_chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_A_randomized_controlled_trial","308121523_Machine_learning_approaches_to_personalize_early_prediction_of_asthma_exacerbations","307557948_The_Effect_of_Smartphone_Interventions_on_Patients_With_Chronic_Obstructive_Pulmonary_Disease_Exacerbations_A_Systematic_Review_and_Meta-Analysis","307552454_Biomarkers_predictive_of_exacerbations_in_the_SPIROMICS_and_COPDGene_cohorts","311271171_Telemedicine_in_chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease","311245129_Telemedicine_in_chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease","309889740_Clinical_characteristics_of_patients_with_frequent_COPD_exacerbations_in_a_Swiss_multicenter_COPD_cohort_study_TOPDOCS","309882626_Predictive_factors_for_exacerbation_and_re-exacerbation_in_COPD_Results_from_the_Swiss_COPD_cohort","306529291_Acute_Exacerbations_and_Lung_Function_Loss_in_Smokers_With_and_Without_COPD","283849472_Predicting_frequent_COPD_exacerbations_using_primary_care_data","300412337_Blood_eosinophil_count_and_exacerbations_in_severe_chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_after_withdrawal_of_inhaled_corticosteroids_A_post-hoc_analysis_of_the_WISDOM_trial","283752641_Systematic_review_of_telemonitoring_in_COPD_an_update","278042755_Telemonitoring_and_Medical_Care_Supporting_of_Patients_with_Chronic_Respiratory_Diseases"]}
