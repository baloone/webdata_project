{"id":"325909483_A_Case_Study_to_Promote_Computational_Thinking_The_Lab_Rotation_Approach","abstract":"This paper presents the rationale, design, development, implementation and evaluation of a case study utilizing the lab rotation model of blended learning for teaching computational thinking in Chinese higher education. The principles of computational thinking were integrated into an entry level course that is required among all college students, entitled Fundamentals of College Computing. A mixed method research approach was utilized to examine students learning outcomes and perception of the instructional process among 114 first year college students. The results showed that the teaching approach was successful at improving students’ computational thinking, particularly on the method and ability dimensions. Recommendations for promoting college students’ computational thinking, as well as teaching strategies for implementing this type of a unique lab rotational approach in China are discussed.","authors":["Jin Cai","Harrison Hao Yang","Di Gong","Jason MacLeod"],"meta":["June 2018","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-94505-7_32","In book: Blended Learning.
