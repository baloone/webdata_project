{"id":"298659076_Introduction_to_Humanoid_Robotics","abstract":"This book is for researchers, engineers, and students who are willing to understand how humanoid robots move and be controlled. The book starts with an overview of the humanoid robotics research history and state of the art. Then it explains the required mathematics and physics such as kinematics of multi-body system, Zero-Moment Point (ZMP) and its relationship with body motion. Biped walking control is discussed in depth, since it is one of the main interests of humanoid robotics. Various topics of the whole body motion generation are also discussed. Finally multi-body dynamics is presented to simulate the complete dynamic behavior of a humanoid robot. Throughout the book, Matlab codes are shown to test the algorithms and to help the readers understanding.","authors":["Shuuji Kajita","Hirohisa Hirukawa","Kensuke Harada","Kazuhito Yokoi"],"meta":["January 2014","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-54536-8","ISBN: 978-3-642-54535-1"],"references":[]}
