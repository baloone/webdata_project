{"id":"233779414_Cryptography_Over_Elliptic_Curve_Of_The_Ring","abstract":"Groups where the discrete logarithm problem (DLP) is\nbelieved to be intractable have proved to be inestimable building\nblocks for cryptographic applications. They are at the heart of numerous\nprotocols such as key agreements, public-key cryptosystems,\ndigital signatures, identification schemes, publicly verifiable secret\nsharings, hash functions and bit commitments. The search for new\ngroups with intractable DLP is therefore of great importance.The\ngoal of this article is to study elliptic curves over the ring Fq[�], with\nFq a finite field of order q and with the relation �n = 0, n ≥ 3.\nThe motivation for this work came from the observation that several\npractical discrete logarithm-based cryptosystems, such as ElGamal,\nthe Elliptic Curve Cryptosystems . In a first time, we describe these\ncurves defined over a ring. Then, we study the algorithmic properties\nby proposing effective implementations for representing the elements\nand the group law. In anther article we study their cryptographic\nproperties, an attack of the elliptic discrete logarithm problem, a new\ncryptosystem over these curves.","authors":["Abdelhakim Chillali"],"meta":["June 2011","Project: Elliptic Curve Cryptography"],"references":["284098379_Ellipic_cuvre_over_ring","265236027_Elliptic_and_modular_curves_over_finite_fields_and_related_computational_issues"]}
