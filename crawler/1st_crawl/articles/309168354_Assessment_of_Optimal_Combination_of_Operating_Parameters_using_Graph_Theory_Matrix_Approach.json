{"id":"309168354_Assessment_of_Optimal_Combination_of_Operating_Parameters_using_Graph_Theory_Matrix_Approach","abstract":"Background/Objectives: Graph theory matrix approach is a logical and systematical approach originated from combinatorial mathematics. Graph theory matrix approach is adopted to find the optimal combination of operating parameters. Methods/Statistical Analysis: Graph theory matrix approach helps to analyze and understand the system as a whole by identifying system and sub-system up to the component level. Attributes digraph is developed to represent the inheritance and the interdependencies of the subsystems. Matrix method is adopted to convert the digraph into mathematical form. Permanent function is deduced to determine the parameter index to find the optimal combination of operating parameters on a diesel engine. Findings: The combination of 18 Ampere load, 270 BTDC Injection timing and 200 bar Injection pressure forms the optimal combination of operating parameters having the highest value of Permanent index. Applications/Improvements: Graph theory matrix approach offers simple, generic, easy and convenient computation. It finds applications in the fields of education, neural networks, automotive industry, manufacturing, electronic devices, total quality management, location of plants, supply chain management, information technology, human resource selection etc.","authors":["Geetha N.K.","N.
