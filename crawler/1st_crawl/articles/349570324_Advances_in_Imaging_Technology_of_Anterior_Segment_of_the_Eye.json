{"id":"349570324_Advances_in_Imaging_Technology_of_Anterior_Segment_of_the_Eye","abstract":"Advances in imaging technology and computer science have allowed the development of newer assessment of the anterior segment, including Corvis ST, Brillouin microscopy, ultrahigh-resolution optical coherence tomography, and artificial intelligence. ey enable accurate and precise assessment of structural and biomechanical alterations associated with anterior segment disorders. is review will focus on these 4 new techniques, and a brief overview of these modalities will be introduced. e authors will also discuss the recent advances in research regarding these techniques and potential application of these techniques in clinical practice. Many studies on these modalities have reported promising results, indicating the potential for more detailed comprehensive understanding of the anterior segment tissues.","authors":["Sang Beom Han","Yu-Chi Liu","Karim Mohamed-Noriega","Jodhbir Singh Mehta"],"meta":["February 2021Journal of Ophthalmology 2021(2)","DOI:10.1155/2021/9539765"],"references":["339218520_Insights_into_Systemic_Disease_through_Retinal_Imaging-Based_Oculomics","339044553_Biomechanical_diagnostics_of_the_cornea","338876629_Deep_learning_segmentation_for_optical_coherence_tomography_measurements_of_the_lower_tear_meniscus","338472765_Comparison_of_Corneal_Biomechanical_Properties_among_Axial_Myopic_Nonaxial_Myopic_and_Nonmyopic_Eyes","337713706_A_new_method_for_detecting_the_outer_corneal_contour_in_images_from_an_ultra-fast_Scheimpflug_camera","337207957_An_artificial_intelligence-based_deep_learning_algorithm_for_the_diagnosis_of_diabetic_neuropathy_using_corneal_confocal_microscopy_a_development_and_validation_study","339273716_Quantitative_and_qualitative_evaluation_of_deep_learning_automatic_segmentations_of_corneal_endothelial_cell_images_of_reduced_image_quality_obtained_following_cornea_transplant","337796375_Automatisierte_Zellzahlung_in_Spenderhornhauten_aus_Organkultur_mittels_Deep_Learning_erreicht_hohe_Prazision_und_Genauigkeit","336851044_Brillouin_Microscopy_Visualizes_Centralized_Corneal_Edema_in_Fuchs_Endothelial_Dystrophy","336709156_Applying_Machine_Learning_Techniques_in_Nomogram_Prediction_and_Analysis_for_SMILE_Treatment","335969329_Artificial_Intelligence_Research_in_Ophthalmology_Guidance_on_Understanding_Appraising_and_Reading_an_Article","335575171_Universal_artificial_intelligence_platform_for_collaborative_management_of_cataracts","336446715_In_vivo_corneal_endothelium_imaging_using_ultrahigh_resolution_OCT","336331935_Automatic_Corneal_Ulcer_Segmentation_Combining_Gaussian_Mixture_Modeling_and_Otsu_Method","334075256_Two-year_changes_in_corneal_stiffness_parameters_after_accelerated_corneal_cross-linking_18mWcm2_versus_9mWcm2"]}
