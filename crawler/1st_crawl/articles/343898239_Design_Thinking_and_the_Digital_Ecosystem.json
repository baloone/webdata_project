{"id":"343898239_Design_Thinking_and_the_Digital_Ecosystem","abstract":"Because design thinking is contextual, insomuch as it varies depending on the tools being used and the environments that support it, there is a need to understand the cognitive impacts of any new platforms that are developed. The focus of this chapter is design thinking in digital, interactive and collective platforms. Drawing on past research, models and theories, it proposes two conceptual frameworks for facilitating interactive and collective design thinking in a digital ecosystem. The new frameworks of Digital Design Thinking (DDT) processes and functionalities are then used to examine six examples of collective and interactive platforms. This chapter contributes to a better understanding of creative, collaborative design thinking using digital tools and within digital environments.","authors":["Ju Hyun Lee","Michael J.
