This study aimed to compare the learning experiences of students who used Moodle (control group) and Facebook (experimental group), in terms of Community of Inquiry (CoI) model presence indicators, i.e., cognitive, teaching, and social presence. Several learning activities for the development of learning environments were carried out by ninety-seven (n=97) students who were enrolled in instructional media design courses in higher education. Findings from quantitative and qualitative analysis indicated that students using either Moodle or Facebook as their learning platform had similar perceptions of teaching and cognitive presence; however, Facebook users had a better social presence using the CoI model than their Moodle counterparts. Another point worth noting is that the experimental groupâ€™s female participants had better teaching presence, cognitive presence, and overall learning experience than their male peers.","authors":["Ioannis Kazanidis","Nikolaos Pellas","Panagiotis Fotaris","Avgoustos Tsinakos"],"meta":["April 2018International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction 34(10):932-942","DOI:10.1080/10447318.2018.1471574","Projects: Virtual worlds and toolsContemporary learning theories and approaches to support learning via interactive enviroments"],"references":["317170968_Social_networking_and_academic_performance_A_review","314290043_Communities_of_inquiry_in_curriculum_approach_to_online_learning_Strengths_and_limitations_in_context","313809657_THE_DEVELOPMENT_OF_A_COMMUNITY_OF_INQUIRY_OVER_TIME_IN_AN_ONLINE_COURSE_UNDERSTANDING_THE_PROGRESSION_AND_INTEGRATION_OF_SOCIAL_COGNITIVE_AND_TEACHING_PRESENCE","310788814_Advances_in_Teaching_and_Learning_on_Facebook_in_Higher_Institutions","344478334_E-Learning_in_the_21st_Century_A_Framework_for_Research_and_Practice","324307358_Thinking_in_Education","317043118_Monitoring_for_Awareness_and_Reflection_in_Ubiquitous_Learning_Environments","316899877_Group_trust_communication_media_and_interactivity_toward_an_integrated_model_of_online_collaborative_learning","309576312_Assessing_the_Interaction_and_Interactivity_in_OUT-MOODLE_LMS_The_Outlook_of_Content_Design_Patterns_System_Configurations_and_User's_Access_Rates","301238579_The_Relationships_Between_Students'_Perceived_Learning_Styles_and_the_Community_of_Inquiry_Presences_in_a_Graduate_Online_Course"]}
