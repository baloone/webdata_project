{"id":"323998601_Cut_Based_Method_for_Comparing_Complex_Networks","abstract":"Revealing the underlying similarity of various complex networks has become both a popular and interdisciplinary topic, with a plethora of relevant application domains. The essence of the similarity here is that network features of the same network type are highly similar, while the features of different kinds of networks present low similarity. In this paper, we introduce and explore a new method for comparing various complex networks based on the cut distance. We show correspondence between the cut distance and the similarity of two networks. This correspondence allows us to consider a broad range of complex networks and explicitly compare various networks with high accuracy. Various machine learning technologies such as genetic algorithms, nearest neighbor classification, and model selection are employed during the comparison process. Our cut method is shown to be suited for comparisons of undirected networks and directed networks, as well as weighted networks. In the model selection process, the results demonstrate that our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art methods with respect to accuracy.","authors":["Qun Liu","Zhishan Dong","En Wang"],"meta":["March 2018Scientific Reports 8(1):5134","DOI:10.1038/s41598-018-21532-5"],"references":["318916868_Directed_Random_Graphs_with_given_Degree_Distributions","283619686_Network_comparison_using_directed_graphlets","313609388_On_the_evolution_of_random_graphs","313487833_A_tutorial_on_spectral_clustering","313347109_Text_Classification_using_String_Kernels","301232956_The_structure_and_function_of_networks","292135930_Gene_regulatory_networks_for_development","283996103_Genetic_Algorithms_In_Search_Optimization_and_Machine_Learning","283617410_Emergence_of_Scaling_in_Random_Networks","264965121_Convergent_sequences_of_dense_graphs_II_Multiway_cuts_and_statistical_physics"]}
