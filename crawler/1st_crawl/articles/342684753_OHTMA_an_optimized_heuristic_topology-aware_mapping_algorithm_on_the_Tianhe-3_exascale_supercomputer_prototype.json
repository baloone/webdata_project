{"id":"342684753_OHTMA_an_optimized_heuristic_topology-aware_mapping_algorithm_on_the_Tianhe-3_exascale_supercomputer_prototype","abstract":"With the rapid increase of the size of applications and the complexity of the supercomputer architecture, topology-aware process mapping becomes increasingly important. High communication cost has become a dominant constraint of the performance of applications running on the supercomputer. To avoid a bad mapping strategy which can lead to terrible communication performance, we propose an optimized heuristic topology-aware mapping algorithm (OHTMA). The algorithm attempts to minimize the hop-byte metric that we use to measure the mapping results. OHTMA incorporates a new greedy heuristic method and pair-exchange-based optimization. It reduces the number of long-distance communications and effectively enhances the locality of the communication. Experimental results on the Tianhe-3 exascale supercomputer prototype indicate that OHTMA can significantly reduce the communication costs.","authors":["Yi-shui Li","Xinhai Chen","Jie Liu","Bo Yang"],"meta":["June 2020Frontiers of Information Technology & Electronic Engineering 21(6):939-949","DOI:10.1631/FITEE.1900075"],"references":["329455606_TAMM_A_New_Topology-Aware_Mapping_Method_for_Parallel_Applications_on_the_Tianhe-2A_Supercomputer_18th_International_Conference_ICA3PP_2018_Guangzhou_China_November_15-17_2018_Proceedings_Part_I","308546105_Fast_and_High_Quality_Topology-Aware_Task_Mapping","300579002_PaCMap","267400920_JOSTLE_Parallel_multilevel_graph-partitioning_software_-_An_overview","260525752_Process_Placement_in_Multicore_ClustersAlgorithmic_Issues_and_Practical_Techniques","254424775_METIS-A_Software_Package_for_Partitioning_Unstructured_Graphs_Partitioning_Meshes_and_Computing_Fill-Reducing_Ordering_of_Sparse_Matrices","220949978_An_evaluative_study_on_the_effect_of_contention_on_message_latencies_in_large_supercomputers","220949204_Performance_analysis_of_Sweep3D_on_Blue_GeneP_with_the_Scalasca_toolset","220781955_The_NAS_parallel_benchmarks--Summary_and_preliminary_results","220767685_Near-Optimal_Placement_of_MPI_processes_on_Hierarchical_NUMA_Architectures","220432228_P-complete_approximation_problems_J_ACM_233_555-565","45174686_Automating_Topology_Aware_Mapping_for_Supercomputers","29601719_Towards_an_Efficient_Process_Placement_Policy_for_MPI_Applications_in_Multicore_Environments","4245406_Topology-aware_task_mapping_for_reducing_communication_contention_on_large_parallel_machines","305871208_PTRAM_A_Parallel_Topology-and_Routing-Aware_Mapping_Framework_for_Large-Scale_HPC_Systems","286881212_An_Overview_of_Topology_Mapping_Algorithms_and_Techniques_in_High-Performance_Computing","282689998_Optimization_of_process-to-core_mapping_based_on_clustering_analysis","276857519_High_Performance_Interconnect_Network_for_Tianhe_System","261049355_Optimization_of_the_hop-byte_metric_for_effective_topology_aware_mapping","256918833_Rank_reordering_for_MPI_communication_optimization","221504702_Multi-Core_aware_process_mapping_and_its_impact_on_communication_overhead_of_parallel_applications","221349466_SCOTCH_A_Software_Package_for_Static_Mapping_by_Dual_Recursive_Bipartitioning_of_Process_and_Architecture_Graphs","221235532_Generic_topology_mapping_strategies_for_large-scale_parallel_architectures"]}
