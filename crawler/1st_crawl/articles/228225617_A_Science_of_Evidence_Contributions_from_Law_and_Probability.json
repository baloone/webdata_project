{"id":"228225617_A_Science_of_Evidence_Contributions_from_Law_and_Probability","abstract":"Presented in this paper are arguments that studies of evidence in the fields of law and probability constitute a science of\nevidence when they are examined in light of five criteria for scientific activity. Three examples of studies from law and\nprobability are presented to justify this argument. Examples from law include a method for classifying recurrent forms and\ncombinations of evidence regardless of their substance or content, studies identifying credibility attributes for different\nforms of evidence and studies of complex argument construction in which new lines of inquiry and evidence are generated or\ndiscovered. Examples from probability include various views among probabilists about what the weight or force of evidence\nmeans and how it should be assessed, several examples of how important subtleties or complexities in evidential reasoning\ncan be captured for study and analysis and one example of how alternative theories about the meaning of complex combinations\nof events can be tested empirically. All evidence has three major credentials: relevance, credibility and inferential force\nor weight. The law and probability studies cited in this paper concern all these credentials.","authors":["David Schum"],"meta":["September 2009Law Probability and Risk 8(3)","DOI:10.1093/lpr/mgp002"],"references":[]}
