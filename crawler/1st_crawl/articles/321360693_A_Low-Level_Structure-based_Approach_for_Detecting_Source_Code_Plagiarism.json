{"id":"321360693_A_Low-Level_Structure-based_Approach_for_Detecting_Source_Code_Plagiarism","abstract":"According to the fact that source code plagiarism is an emerging issue in Computer S cience programming courses, several source code plagiarism detection approaches are developed. One of them is Karnalim's approach, an approach which detects plagiarism based on low-level tokens. This paper proposes an expansion of such approach by incorporating three contributions which are: flow-based token weighting; argument removal heuristic; and invoked method removal. Flow-based token weighting aims to reduce the number of false-positive results; argument removal heuristic aims to generate more-accurate linearized method content; and invoked method removal aims to fasten processing time. According to our evaluation, three findings can be deducted about proposed approach. Firstly, advantages provided by our proposed approach are prominent in both controlled and empirical environment. S econdly, our proposed approach outperforms Karnalim's and state-of-the-art approach in terms of time efficiency. Finally, our approach is moderately effective to handle plagiarism attacks in practical environment.","authors":["Oscar Karnalim"],"meta":["December 2017IAENG International Journal of Computer Science 44(4):501-522"],"references":["321360684_An_Abstract_Method_Linearization_for_Detecting_Source_Code_Plagiarism_in_Object-Oriented_Environment","317646494_Detecting_Source_Code_Plagiarism_on_NET_Programming_Languages_using_Low-level_Representation_and_Adaptive_Local_Alignment","311066242_Software_Keyphrase_Extraction_with_Domain-Specific_Features","309708569_Detecting_Source_Code_Plagiarism_on_Introductory_Programming_Course_Assignments_Using_a_Bytecode_Approach","282320838_Java_Archives_Search_Engine_using_Byte_Code_as_Information_Source","277287260_A_Survey_on_Software_Clone_Detection_Research","275498234_Source_Code_Plagiarism_Detection_Method_Using_Protg_Built_Ontologies","354749404_'CodeAliker'_-_Plagiarism_Detection_on_the_Cloud","289623740_Static_and_Dynamic_JVM_Operand_Stack_Visualization_And_Verification","284768783_A_Machine_Learning_Based_Tool_for_Source_Code_Plagiarism_Detection"]}
