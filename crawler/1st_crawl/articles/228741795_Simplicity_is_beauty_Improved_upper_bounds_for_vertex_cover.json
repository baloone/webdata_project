{"id":"228741795_Simplicity_is_beauty_Improved_upper_bounds_for_vertex_cover","abstract":"This paper presents an O(1.2738 k + kn)-time polynomial-space algorithm for VERTEX COVER improving both the previous O(1.286 k +kn)-time polynomial-space algorithm by Chen, Kanj, and Jia, and the very recent O(1.2745 k k 4 + kn)-time exponential-space algorithm, by Chandran and Grandoni. Most of the previous algorithms rely on exhaustive case-by-case analysis, and an underlying conservative worst-case-scenario assumption. The contribution of the paper lies in the extreme sim-plicity, uniformity, and obliviousness of the algorithm presented. Several new techniques, as well as generalizations of previous techniques, are introduced including: general folding, struction, tuples, and local amortized analysis. The algorithm also induces improvement on the upper bound for the INDEPENDENT SET problem on graphs of degree bounded by 6.","authors":["Jianer Chen","Iyad A Kanj","Ge Xia"],"meta":["January 2010Theoretical Computer Science 411","SourceDBLP"],"references":["297315890_Blow-ups_WinWin's_and_crown_rules_Some_new_directions_in_FPT","265502171_Fundamentals_of_Parameterized_Complexity","242538384_A_Local-Ratio_Theorem_for_Approximating_the_Weighted_Vertex_Cover_Problem","242422660_Vertex_packing_structural_properties_and_algorithms","223445877_On_Efficient_Fixed-Parameter_Algorithms_for_Weighted_Vertex_Cover","223229984_On_the_existence_of_subexponential_parameterized_algorithms","222673286_Vertex_Cover_Further_Observations_and_Further_Improvements","222666128_Which_Problems_Have_Strongly_Exponential_Complexity","222614617_Algorithms_for_Maximum_Independent_Sets","222575533_Solving_large_FPT_problems_on_coarse-grained_parallel_machines"]}
