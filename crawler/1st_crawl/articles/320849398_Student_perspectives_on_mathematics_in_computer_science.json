{"id":"320849398_Student_perspectives_on_mathematics_in_computer_science","abstract":"Mathematical competence is an important attribute for computer scientists, and mathematical courses are a core component of computing curricula. However, aspects of the role of mathematics, such as the importance of mathematical maturity and the relevance of calculus, have been debated for several decades. In addition, this discussion has focused on faculty and professional viewpoints. Student perceptions are noticeably absent. This paper describes an interview study conducted at a North American university that explores the perspectives of students on the role and importance of mathematics as well as the relationship between mathematics and computer science. Like the faculty, students voiced a range of viewpoints, and they selected courses based on their evolving beliefs. We found evidence that these course selections - and hence, the flexibility of the curriculum - helped to reinforce previously held beliefs about mathematics. The interviews also provided insight on the importance of career inclination on attitude toward the program and the curriculum's role in identity formation.","authors":["Nikki Sigurdson","Andrew Petersen"],"meta":["November 2017","DOI:10.1145/3141880.3141888","Conference: the 17th Koli Calling Conference"],"references":["288492421_CS2013","282358042_Second_Year_Computer_Science_and_IT_Students'_Experience_of_Participation_in_the_Discipline","274309848_Computational_Thinking","262300162_Abstraction_Ability_as_an_Indicator_of_Success_for_Learning_Computer_Science","259669422_The_Roles_of_Mathematics_in_Computer_Science","254341638_The_Process_of_Choosing_What_to_Study_A_Longitudinal_Study_of_Upper_Secondary_Students'_Identity_Work_When_Choosing_Higher_Education","235902115_Engagement_in_Computer_Science_and_IT_--_What_A_Matter_of_Identity","234815316_Discrete_mathematicsstructures_how_do_we_deal_with_the_late_appreciation_problem","234782296_Abstraction_ability_as_an_indicator_of_success_for_learning_computing_science","228809719_Teaching_discrete_structures_A_systematic_review_of_the_literature","226743145_Personal_Epistemology_Research_Implications_for_Learning_and_Teaching","221538007_Student_perceptions_of_computer_science_a_retention_study_comparing_graduating_seniors_with_cs_leavers","221537454_Discrete_partnership_-_A_case_for_a_full_year_of_discrete_math","220613161_Computer_science_is_more_important_than_calculus_the_challenge_of_living_up_to_our_potential","220427690_Is_abstraction_the_key_to_computing","220420371_Computational_thinking","316858624_Computer_Science_Curricula_2013_Curriculum_Guidelines_for_Undergraduate_Degree_Programs_in_Computer_Science","310792069_The_long_quest_for_computational_thinking","303319788_MATH_COUNTSComputational_maturity","302323478_Developing_Mathematical_Maturity","295819672_Understanding_initial_undergraduate_expectations_and_identity_in_computing_studies","295684198_MATH_COUNTSInside_CS2013","287391362_Learner-Centered_Design_of_Computing_Education_Research_on_Computing_for_Everyone","284204659_From_sunset_to_sunrise","281562408_The_SAGE_handbook_of_grounded_theory","277375026_Computer_science_is_more_important_than_calculus","266661045_How_CS_undergraduates_make_course_choices","262361881_Establishing_the_impact_of_a_computer_sciencemathematics_anti-symbiotic_stereotype_in_CS_students","262254527_Undergraduate_conceptions_of_the_field_of_computer_science","242625839_Why_universities_require_compute_science_students_to_take_math","234811916_Discrete_mathematics_support_of_and_preparation_for_the_study_of_computer_science","228866475_Understanding_Computing_Stereotypes_with_Self-Categorization_Theory","225528470_It's_Mathematical_After_All-the_Nature_of_Learning_Computer_Programming","221538379_Discrete_mathematics_for_computer_science_majors_-_where_are_we_How_do_we_proceed","221538105_Why_students_with_an_apparent_aptitude_for_computer_science_don't_choose_to_major_in_computer_science","220613196_Why_computer_science_students_need_math","220612966_Do_we_need_ANY_mathematics_in_computer_science_curricula","220424941_Curriculum_'78_-_Is_Computer_Science_Really_that_Unmathematical","220420930_The_Profession_of_IT_Beyond_Computational_Thinking"]}
