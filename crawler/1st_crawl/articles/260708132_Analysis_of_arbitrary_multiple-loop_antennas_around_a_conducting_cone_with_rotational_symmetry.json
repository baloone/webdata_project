{"id":"260708132_Analysis_of_arbitrary_multiple-loop_antennas_around_a_conducting_cone_with_rotational_symmetry","abstract":"A rigorous technique is presented for the analysis of multiple loops around a conducting cone, taking into account mutual coupling. A single and a two/five-loop system around the cone is investigated using the technique to characterise the effect of coupling of parasitic loops on the primary-loop antenna. A two-loop system over the cone-tip is also analysed. It is found that the parasitic loop in this case can significantly improve the matching characteristics of the primary loop. The technique is also used to analyse a three-loop director-reflector configuration for loops below and above the cone-tip. The radiation characteristics were also evaluated. The computed results were verified using simulation and measurements.","authors":["Bratin Ghosh","Sk.
