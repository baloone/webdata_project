{"id":"224391123_A_New_Method_for_Identifying_Orders_of_Input-Output_Models_for_Nonlinear_Systems","abstract":"The paper proposes a new method for identifying orders of input-output models for unknown nonlinear dynamic systems. The approach is based on the continuity property of the nonlinear functions which represent input-output models of continuous dynamic systems. The approach does not depend on any nonlinear function approximation methods and solely depends on the system's input-output data measured in experiments. By evaluating the modification of an index which is defined as Lipschitz number with the successive modification of model orders, the appropriate model orders can be determined simply and reliably. Theoretical background of the present approach is discussed. Several examples from chaotic dynamic systems, nonlinear plant models are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the present method.","authors":["Xiangdong He","Haruhiko Asada"],"meta":["July 1993","DOI:10.23919/ACC.1993.4793346","SourceIEEE Xplore","Conference: American Control Conference, 1993"],"references":["216638258_Broomhead_DS_King_GP_Extracting_qualitative_dynamics_from_experimental_data_Physica_D_20_217-236","272832242_Nonlinear_signal_processing_using_neural_networks","245372110_Transferring_Manipulative_Skills_to_Robots_Representation_and_Acquisition_of_Tool_Manipulative_Skills_Using_a_Process_Dynamics_Model","233784964_Fast_Learning_in_Networks_of_Locally-Tuned_Processing_Units","224749723_Transfer_of_human_skills_to_neural_net_robot_controllers","37530449_Non-Linear_Systems_Identification_Using_Neural_Networks","13391860_Independent_Coordinates_for_Strange_Attractors_from_Mutual_Information","3301484_Identification_and_Control_of_Dynamic_Systems_Using_Neural_Networks"]}
