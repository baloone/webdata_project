{"id":"350952325_Dominating_Topological_Analysis_and_Comparison_of_the_Cellular_Neural_Network","abstract":"Graph theory is a discrete branch of mathematics for designing and predicting a network. Some topological invariants are mathematical tools for the analysis of connection properties of a particular network. The Cellular Neural Network (CNN) is a computer paradigm in the field of machine learning and computer science. In this article we have given a close expression to dominating invariants computed by the dominating degree for a cellular neural network. Moreover, we have also presented a 3D comparison between dominating invariants and classical degree-based indices to show that, in some cases, dominating invariants give a better correlation on the cellular neural network as compared to classical indices.","authors":["Farukh Ejaz","Muhammad Hussain","Hamad Almohamedh","Khalid M.
