{"id":"282749784_Involvement_and_Persuasion_Tradition_Versus_Integration","abstract":"In a recent meta-analysis, Johnson and Eagly (1989) questioned our conceptualization of and evidence for the effects of involvement on persuasion (Petty & Cacioppo, 1979, 1986). In particular, they concluded that (a) what we had termed issue involvement represented two distinct types of involvement (outcome- versus value-relevant), (b) each type of involvement had unique effects on persuasion, and (c) outcome involvement effects may be obtained only by 1 group of researchers. We argue that although 2 distinct research traditions of involvement have emerged, our original position that the 2 categories of involvement induce similar processes in persuasion situations remains viable. Evidence from Johnson and Eagly's meta-analysis shows that as both types of involvement increase, argument quality becomes a more important determinant of attitudes. The greater message rejection found with involvement in value as compared with outcome studies can be explained in terms of confounding factors. Finally, we note that the outcome involvement effects that we reported initially have been replicated by other investigators, including Johnson and Eagly.","authors":["Richard E Petty","John T Cacioppo"],"meta":["May 1990Psychological Bulletin 107(3):367-374","DOI:10.1037//0033-2909.107.3.367"],"references":["287373054_On_the_Power_and_Functionality_of_Attitudes_The_Role_of_Attitude_Accessibility","314282087_Effects_of_personal_involvement_Thought-provoking_implications_for_social_loafing","313676201_The_structure_of_individual_attitudes_and_attitude_systems","313661669_The_importance_of_cognitive_responses_in_persuasion","312900914_Conviction","280687637_Uncertainty_Orientation_and_Persuasion_Individual_Differences_in_the_Effects_of_Personal_Relevance_on_Social_Judgments","278915353_Elastic_shifts_of_opinion_Determinants_of_direction_and_durability","277285429_Cognitive_Learning_Cognitive_Response_to_Persuasion_and_Attitude_Change","275686987_Attitude_Change_A_Critical_Analysis_of_Theoretical_Approaches","270085594_Beliefs_Attitudes_and_Values_A_Theory_of_Organization_and_Change","240515515_Source_and_message_factors_in_persuasion_A_reply_to_Stiff's_critique_of_the_elaboration_likelihood_model","269599097_Personal_Involvement_An_Examination_of_Processing_Differences","264667904_Attitudes_Traits_and_Actions_Dispositional_Prediction_of_Behavior_in_Personality_and_Social_Psychology","247746189_Self-Referencing_A_Strategy_for_Increasing_Processing_of_Message_Content","239745284_A_Cognitive_Model_of_Attitudinal_Involvement"]}
