{"id":"256805757_More_Results_on_Singular_Value_Inequalities_for_Compact_Operators","abstract":"A singular value inequality due to Bhatia and Kittaneh says that if A and B are compact operators on a complex separable Hilbert space such that A is self-adjoint, B⩾0B⩾0, and ±A⩽B±A⩽B, thensj(A)⩽sj(B⊕B)sj(A)⩽sj(B⊕B)for j=1,2,…j=1,2,…. We give an equivalent inequality, which states that if A,BA,B, and C are compact operators such that ABB∗C⩾0, thensj(B)⩽sj(A⊕C)sj(B)⩽sj(A⊕C)for j=1,2,…j=1,2,…. Moreover, we give a sharper inequality and we prove that this inequality is equivalent to three equivalent inequalities considered by Tao. In particular, we show that if A and B are compact operators such that A is self-adjoint, B⩾0B⩾0, and ±A⩽B±A⩽B, then2sj(A)⩽sj((B+A)⊕(B-A))2sj(A)⩽sj((B+A)⊕(B-A))for j=1,2,…j=1,2,…. Some applications of these results will be given.","authors":["Wasim Audeh","Fuad Kittaneh"],"meta":["November 2012Linear Algebra and its Applications 437(10):2516–2522","DOI:10.1016/j.laa.2012.06.032"],"references":["266513934_Some_Norm_Inequalities_for_Operators","247047254_On_the_Singular_Values_of_a_Product_of_Operators","246531658_Introduction_to_the_theory_of_linear_nonselfadjoint_operators_in_Hilbert_space","243095344_Singular_Values_of_Differences_of_Positive_Semidefinite_Matrices","238850709_More_results_on_singular_value_inequalities_of_matrices","222585144_Inequalities_for_sums_and_direct_sums_of_Hilbert_space_operators","222033826_The_matrix_arithmetic-geometric_mean_inequality_revisited","220026774_Introduction_to_the_Theory_of_Linear_Non-Selfadjolt_Operators"]}
