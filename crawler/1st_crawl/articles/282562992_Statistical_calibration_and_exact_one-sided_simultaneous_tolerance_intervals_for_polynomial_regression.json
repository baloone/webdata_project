{"id":"282562992_Statistical_calibration_and_exact_one-sided_simultaneous_tolerance_intervals_for_polynomial_regression","abstract":"Statistical calibration using linear regression is a useful statistical tool having many applications. Calibration for infinitely many future -values requires the construction of simultaneous tolerance intervals (STI’s). As calibration often involves only two variables and and polynomial regression is probably the most frequently used model for relating with , construction of STI’s for polynomial regression plays a key role in statistical calibration for infinitely many future -values. The only exact STI’s published in the statistical literature are provided by Mee et al. (1991) and Odeh and Mee (1990). But they are for a multiple linear regression model, in which the covariates are assumed to have no functional relationships. When applied to polynomial regression, the resultant STI’s are conservative. In this paper, one-sided exact STI’s have been constructed for a polynomial regression model over any given interval. The available computer program allows the exact methods developed in this paper to be implemented easily. Real examples are given for illustration.","authors":["Yang Han","Wei Liu","Frank Bretz","Fang Wan"],"meta":["July 2015Journal of Statistical Planning and Inference 168","DOI:10.1016/j.jspi.2015.07.005"],"references":["282543802_Finite_Element_Simulation_of_Medium-Range_Blast_Loading_Using_LS-DYNA","263111972_Simultaneous_Tolerance_Intervals_for_the_Linear_Regression_Model","329472741_Multivariate_Calibration","306145905_Regression_using_fractional_polynomials_of_continuous_covariates","289641785_Multiple_use_confidence_regions_in_multivariate_calibration","277920218_An_Exact_Confidence_Set_for_a_Maximum_Point_of_a_Univariate_Polynomial_Function_in_a_Given_Interval","269668650_Measuring_Marathon_Courses_An_Application_of_Statistical_Calibration_Theory","266725085_Interval_Estimates_in_the_Spectroscopic_Calibration_Problem","265671618_Statistical_Calibration_A_Review","264624430_Simultaneous_confidence_bands_for_a_percentile_line_in_linear_regression","257199125_Multiple_use_one-sided_hypotheses_testing_in_univariate_linear_calibration","254332992_Calibration_and_Simultaneous_Tolerance_Intervals_for_Regression","243081792_Simultaneous_Tolerance_Intervals_in_Regression","243043051_Statistical_inferences_for_linear_regression_models_when_the_covariates_have_functional_relationships_Polynomial_regression","239799599_A_Comparison_of_Uncertainty_Criteria_for_Calibration","238879799_Simulation-Based_Simultaneous_Confidence_Bands_in_Multiple_Linear_Regression_With_Predictor_Variables_Constrained_in_Intervals","233348642_One-sided_simultaneous_tolerance_limits_for_regression","226986466_An_application_of_the_finite_element_method_to_maximum_entropy_tomographic_image_reconstruction","38385235_A_Statistical_Theory_of_Calibration","38368320_The_Interpretation_of_Certain_Regression_Methods_and_Their_Use_in_Biological_and_Industrial_Research","38365205_An_Approach_to_Simultaneous_Tolerance_Intervals_in_Regression","38348545_Tolerance_regions_and_multiple-use_confidence_regions_in_multivariate_calibration","19729513_The_Efficiency_of_Simulation-Based_Multiple_Comparisons","17135808_Unlimited_Simultaneous_Discrimination_Intervals_in_Regression","4746845_Multiple_Comparison_of_Several_Linear_Regression_Models","2699604_Multiple_Use_Confidence_Regions_in_Multivariate_Calibration"]}
