{"id":"318394753_When_Robots_Tell_Each_Other_Stories_The_Emergence_of_Artificial_Fiction","abstract":"This chapter outlines a proposal for an embodied computational model of storytelling, using robots. If it could be built, the model would open the possibility for experimental demonstration and investigation of how simple narrative might emerge from interactions with the world and then be shared, as stories, with others. The core proposition of this chapter is that in such a system we would have a practical synthetic model of robot-robot storytelling. That model might then be used to experimentally explore a range of interesting questions, for example on narrative-based social learning or the relationship between the narrative self and shared narrative.","authors":["Alan F T Winfield"],"meta":["January 2017","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-64714-2_4","In book: Narrating ComplexityEdition: In PressPublisher: SpringerEditors: Richard Walsh, Susan Stepney"],"references":["276026978_On_the_Evolution_of_Behaviors_through_Embodied_Imitation","268745073_Robots_with_Internal_Models_A_Route_to_Self-Aware_and_Hence_Safer_Robots","268741533_Towards_an_Ethical_Robot_Internal_Models_Consequences_and_Ethical_Action_Selection","291448506_Robosemiotics_and_embodied_enactive_cognition","265682188_Complex_adaptive_systems","264736686_Darwin's_Dangerous_Idea","250029875_Complex_Adaptive_Systems","228336793_Really_reusable_robot_code_and_the_playerstage_project","225598605_Reusable_Robot_Software_and_the_PlayerStage_Project","223932523_Architectures_for_functional_imagination"]}
