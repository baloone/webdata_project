{"id":"236366775_An_introduction_to_chordal_graphs_and_clique_trees","abstract":"Clique trees and chordal graphs have carved out a niche for themselves in recent work on sparse matrix algorithms, due primarily to research questions associated with advanced computer architectures. This paper is a unified and elementary introduction to the standard characterizations of chordal graphs and clique trees. The pace is leisurely, as detailed proofs of all results are included. We also briefly discuss applications of chordal graphs and clique trees in sparse matrix computations.","authors":["Jean R. S. Blair","Barry W.
