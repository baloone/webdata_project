{"id":"295684147_Coderunner","abstract":"How should we assess programming skills? Asking students to write code in a traditional hand-written exam can produce results like those in Figure 1. It is nearly impossible to meaningfully grade such code. With sufficient effort one can get some idea of whether the general idea is correct, but to assess programming skill we need much more than this. For example, there will almost certainly be errors in the code; how do we know whether the student would be able to correct those errors or not?","authors":["Richard Lobb","Jenny Harlow"],"meta":["February 2016ACM Inroads 7(1):47-51","DOI:10.1145/2810041"],"references":[]}
