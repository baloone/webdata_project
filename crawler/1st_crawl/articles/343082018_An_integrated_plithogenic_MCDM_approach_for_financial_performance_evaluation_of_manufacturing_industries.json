{"id":"343082018_An_integrated_plithogenic_MCDM_approach_for_financial_performance_evaluation_of_manufacturing_industries","abstract":"Financial performance evaluation is very significant for manufacturing industries in a competitive environment to achieve investment goals, especially increasing revenue. Financial performance measures must be identified accurately, because the evaluation process reflects the effectiveness of a company. The purpose of this article is to present a plithogenic multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) model based on neutrosophic analytic hierarchy process (AHP), Vlse Kriterijumska Optimizacija Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) method, and Technique in Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method. The financial performance in this study is measured by a set of financial ratios. To examine the proposed model, the top 10 steel companies in Egypt are evaluated based on specified financial ratios. According to steel manufacturing experts, the weight of the criteria is determined using AHP method. The company ranking is determined using VIKOR and TOPSIS comparatively. The results show that the obtained ranks of the companies by these methods are almost the same.","authors":["Mohamed Abdel-Basset","Weiping Ding","Rehab Mohamed","Noura Metawa"],"meta":["September 2020Risk Management 22(7)","DOI:10.1057/s41283-020-00061-4"],"references":["338717366_A_Hybrid_Plithogenic_Decision-Making_Approach_with_Quality_Function_Deployment_for_Selecting_Supply_Chain_Sustainability_Metrics","338711249_Extension_of_Soft_Set_to_Hypersoft_Set_and_then_to_Plithogenic_Hypersoft_Set","332599775_Uncertain_risk_assessment_modelling_for_bus_body_manufacturing_supply_chain_using_AHP_and_fuzzy_AHP","348419693_Risk_assessment_based_on_novel_intuitionistic_fuzzy-hybrid-modified_TOPSIS_approach","333840704_Effects_of_normalization_on_the_entropy-based_TOPSIS_method","333004085_A_new_approach_to_avoid_rank_reversal_cases_in_the_TOPSIS_method","332500930_A_new_approach_to_avoid_rank_reversal_cases_in_the_TOPSIS_method","331880607_Pythagorean_fuzzy_VIKOR-based_approach_for_safety_risk_assessment_in_mine_industry","331833820_Tackling_the_fuzziness_of_business_model_concept_A_study_in_the_airline_industry","331443409_An_integrated_approach_to_catering_supplier_selection_using_AHP-ARAS-MCGP_methodology","327559255_Plithogenic_Set_an_Extension_of_Crisp_Fuzzy_Intuitionistic_Fuzzy_and_Neutrosophic_Sets_-_Revisited","331406072_A_new_parsimonious_AHP_methodology_Assigning_priorities_to_many_objects_by_comparing_pairwise_few_reference_objects","331102621_Extended_VIKOR_method_using_incomplete_criteria_weights","328115141_A_VIKOR_based_approach_for_assessing_the_social_environmental_and_economic_effects_of_smog_on_human_health","328036123_Performance_Evaluation_of_Green_Suppliers_using_Entropy-TOPSIS-F"]}
