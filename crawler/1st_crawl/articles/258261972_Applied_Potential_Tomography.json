{"id":"258261972_Applied_Potential_Tomography","abstract":"A review of attempts which have been made to produce in vivo images of the spatial distribution of tissue resistivity is given. The collection systems for in vivo images and the methods for the reconstruction of such images are discussed. Some of the problems that remain to be solved for applied tomography are identified.","authors":["D C Barber","B H Brown"],"meta":["September 1984Journal of Physics E Scientific Instruments 17(9):723","DOI:10.1088/0022-3735/17/9/002"],"references":["252353258_Analysis_of_electrical_conductivity_imaging","245037681_The_effect_of_haematocrit_on_the_resistivity_of_human_blood_at_37C_and_100_KHz","240652522_Limiting_Depth_of_Detection_in_Line_Electrode_SYSTEMS","225358911_Electrode_guarding_in_electrical_impedance_measurements_of_physiological_systems-a_critique","224473467_Alternative_methods_for_determining_the_electrical_conductivity_of_core_samples_II","23167372_Alternative_methods_for_determining_the_electrical_conductivity_of_core_samples","22028527_Measurement_of_pleural_effusion_by_electrical_impedance","21899224_Directional_differences_of_impulse_spread_in_trabecular_muscle_from_mammalian_heart","18141318_A_focusing_electrode_bridge_for_unilateral_lung_resistance","17140060_Electrical_resistivity_of_lung_at_100_kHz","17117225_The_specific_resistance_of_biological_material-A_compendium_of_data_for_the_biomedical_engineer_and_physiologist","16638437_Electrical_Impedance_imaging_of_the_Thorax","16099616_Comparison_of_electrode_impedances_of_Pt_PtIr_10_Ir_and_Ir-AIROF_electrodes_used_in_electrophysiological_experiments","15863961_Field_calculations_in_the_head_of_a_newborn_infant_and_their_application_to_the_interpretation_of_transcephalic_impedance_measurements","10201554_Specific_Resistance_of_Body_Tissues","9878085_Specific_Electric_Resistance_of_Body_Tissues","9590771_Resistivity_of_Body_Tissues_at_Low_Frequencies","3399456_Imaging_Spatial_Distributions_of_Resistivity_Using_Applied_Potential_Tomography","3146599_Electrical_Impedance_Computed_Tomography_ICT_A_New_CT_Imaging_Technique","3039215_A_Limitation_on_Systems_for_Imaging_Electrical_Conductivity_Distributions","3038812_An_Impedance_Camera_for_Spatially_Specific_Measurements_of_the_Thorax","3037946_Electrical_and_Dielectric_Properties_of_Wet_Bone_as_a_Function_of_Frequency","3037619_The_Four-Electrode_Resistivity_Technique_as_Applied_to_Cardiac_Muscle","2996520_Overview_of_computerized_tomography_with_emphasis_on_future_developments"]}
