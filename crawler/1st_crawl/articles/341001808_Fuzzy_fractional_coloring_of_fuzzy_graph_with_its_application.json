{"id":"341001808_Fuzzy_fractional_coloring_of_fuzzy_graph_with_its_application","abstract":"In this article, a new idea of fuzzy fractional coloring of fuzzy graph is presented and fuzzy fractional chromatic number is defined. A relationship between fuzzy fractional chromatic number and fuzzy fractional clique number is established. Some properties of fuzzy chromatic number of fuzzy graphs and fuzzy fractional chromatic number of fuzzy graphs are proved and the concept of k-strong adjacent vertices is introduced. Fuzzy chromatic number and fuzzy fractional chromatic number have been calculated on lexicographic product of two fuzzy graphs. Also, fuzzy chromatic number, independence number and fuzzy fractional chromatic number have been investigated on disjoint union of two fuzzy graphs. Lastly, a real life application of fuzzy fractional coloring on fuzzy graph is discussed.","authors":["Tanmoy Mahapatra","Ganesh Ghorai","Madhumangal Pal"],"meta":["November 2020Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing 11(11):5771-5784","DOI:10.1007/s12652-020-01953-9"],"references":["338757122_A_study_on_harmonious_chromatic_number_of_total_graph_of_central_graph_of_generalized_Petersen_graph","336109046_An_Improved_spectral_graph_partition_intelligent_clustering_algorithm_for_low-power_wireless_networks","311452808_FUZZY_GRAPH_COLORING_USING_CUTS","348900638_On_Lexicographic_Products_of_Two_Fuzzy_Graphs","332925094_Fuzzy_chromatic_number_of_union_of_fuzzy_graphs_An_algorithm_properties_and_its_application","323080364_m-polar_fuzzy_graphs_and_m-polar_fuzzy_line_graphs","322386536_Genus_value_of_m-polar_fuzzy_graphs","312889648_Planarity_in_vague_graphs_with_application","310467572_Certain_Types_of_Edge_m-Polar_Fuzzy_Graphs","306543315_Intuitionistic_Fuzzy_Tolerance_Graphs_with_application","304526053_Faces_and_dual_of_m-polar_fuzzy_planar_graphs","304525757_Some_properties_of_m-polar_fuzzy_graphs","295908728_A_study_on_m-polar_fuzzy_planar_graphs","306331684_Product_of_intuitionistic_fuzzy_graphs_and_degree","285264036_Fuzzy_Graphs_Fuzzy_Sets_and_their_Applications"]}
