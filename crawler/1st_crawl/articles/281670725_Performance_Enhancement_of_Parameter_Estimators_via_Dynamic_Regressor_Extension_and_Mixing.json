{"id":"281670725_Performance_Enhancement_of_Parameter_Estimators_via_Dynamic_Regressor_Extension_and_Mixing","abstract":"A new way to design parameter estimators with enhanced performance is\nproposed in the paper. The procedure consists of two stages, first, the\ngeneration of new regression forms via the application of a dynamic operator to\nthe original regression. Second, a suitable mix of these new regressors to\nobtain the final desired regression form. For classical linear regression forms\nthe procedure yields a new parameter estimator whose convergence is established\nwithout the usual requirement of regressor persistency of excitation. The\ntechnique is also applied to nonlinear regressions with \"partially\" monotonic\nparameter dependence---giving rise again to estimators with enhanced\nperformance. Simulation results illustrate the advantages of the proposed\nprocedure in both scenarios.","authors":["Stanislav Aranovskiy","Alexey Bobtsov","Ortega Romeo","Pyrkin Anton"],"meta":["September 2015IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control PP(99)","DOI:10.1109/TAC.2016.2614889","SourcearXiv"],"references":["252155543_Nonlinear_and_Adaptive_Control_with_Applications","243781124_The_Theory_of_Matrices_With_Applications","224144461_Immersion_and_Invariance_Adaptive_Control_of_Nonlinearly_Parameterized_Nonlinear_Systems","222106648_Adaptation_and_Parameter_Estimation_in_Systems_With_Unstable_Target_Dynamics_and_Nonlinear_Parametrization","289481783_Fast_compensation_of_unknown_multiharmonic_disturbance_for_nonlinear_plant_with_input_delay","280590435_Composite_Learning_Control_With_Application_to_Inverted_Pendulums","264388267_Design_of_impulsive_adaptive_observers_for_improvement_of_persistency_of_excitation_DESIGN_OF_IMPULSIVE_ADAPTIVE_OBSERVERS","252028951_Adaptive_cancellation_of_unknown_multiharmonic_disturbance_for_nonlinear_plant_with_input_delay","223140789_Adaptive_computed_torque_control_for_rigid_link_manipulators","222394804_Convergent_dynamics_a_tribute_to_Boris_Pavlovich_Demidovich"]}
