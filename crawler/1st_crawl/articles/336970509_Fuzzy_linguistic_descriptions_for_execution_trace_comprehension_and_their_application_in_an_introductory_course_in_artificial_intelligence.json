{"id":"336970509_Fuzzy_linguistic_descriptions_for_execution_trace_comprehension_and_their_application_in_an_introductory_course_in_artificial_intelligence","abstract":"Execution traces comprehension is an important topic in computer science since it allows software engineers to get a better understanding of the system behavior. However, traces are usually very large and hence they are difficult to interpret. Parallel, execution traces comprehension is a very important topic into the algorithms learning courses since it allows students to get a better understanding of the algorithm behavior. Therefore, there is a need to investigate ways to help students (and teachers) find and understand important information conveyed in a trace despite the trace being massive.\nIn this paper, we propose a new approximation for execution traces comprehension based on fuzzy linguistic descriptions.\n\nA new methodology and a data-driven architecture based on linguistic modelling of complex phenomenon are presented and\nexplained. In particular, they are applied to automatically generate linguistic reports from execution traces generated during\nthe execution of algorithm implemented by the students of an introductory course of artificial intelligence. To the best of our\nknowledge, it is the first time that linguistic modelling of complex phenomenon is applied to execution traces comprehension.\nThroughout the article, it is shown how this kind of technology can be employed as a useful computer-assisted assessment\ntool that provides students and teachers with technical, immediate and personalised feedback about the algorithms that are\nbeing studied and implemented. At the same time, they provide us with two useful applications: they are an indispensable\npedagogical resource for improving comprehension of execution traces, and they play an important role in the process of\nmeasuring and evaluating the “believability” of the agents implemented.\n\nTo show and explore the possibilities of this new technology, a web platform has been designed and implemented by one\nof the authors, and it has been incorporated into the process of assessment of an introductory artificial intelligence course.\nFinally, an empirical evaluation to confirm our hypothesis was performed and a survey directed to the students was carried out\nto measure the quality of the learning-teaching process by using this methodology enriched with fuzzy linguistic descriptions.","authors":["Clemente Rubio Manzano","Tomás Lermanda Senoceaín","Claudia Martinez-Araneda","Christian Vidal-Castro"],"meta":["October 2019Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems","DOI:10.3233/JIFS-190935","Project: Linguistic Description of Data in Higher Education / Universidad y Descripción Lingüística de Datos"],"references":["332445812_Cubic_bipolar_fuzzy_ordered_weighted_geometric_aggregation_operators_and_their_application_using_internal_and_external_cubic_bipolar_fuzzy_data","328173570_Similarity_Measure_Between_Linguistic_Terms_by_Using_Restricted_Equivalence_Functions_and_Its_Application_to_Expert_Systems","323303428_Fuzzy_Parameterized_Fuzzy_Soft_Compact_Spaces_with_Decision-Making","322582654_Linguistic_Description_of_Complex_Phenomena_with_the_rLDCP_R_Package","333794018_N-soft_topology_and_its_applications_to_multi-criteria_group_decision_making","332386925_Novel_concepts_of_soft_rough_set_topology_with_applications","330547809_Special_issue_on_Similarity_Correlation_and_Association_Measures_Dedicated_to_the_memory_of_Lotfi_Zadeh","328399690_An_Ensemble_Fuzzy_Logic_Approach_to_Game_Bot_Detection_through_Behavioural_Features","327638265_Classification_of_Humans_and_Bots_in_Two_Typical_Two-player_Computer_Games","327635227_Studying_believability_assessment_in_racing_games"]}
