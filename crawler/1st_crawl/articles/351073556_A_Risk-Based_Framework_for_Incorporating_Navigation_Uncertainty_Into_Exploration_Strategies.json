{"id":"351073556_A_Risk-Based_Framework_for_Incorporating_Navigation_Uncertainty_Into_Exploration_Strategies","abstract":"We present a novel framework for incorporating navigation uncertainty into exploration strategies, specifically for autonomous ground robots operating in environments where there exists a nonzero probability of complete failure. In real-world applications, autonomous navigation is negatively influenced by uncontrollable factors, such as terrain complexity and dynamic obstacles, which require the robot to spend additional time or energy during navigation that is not accounted for\nin conventional path planners. Using a Monte-Carlo simulation-based scheme, we preserve the stochasticity of the environment and allow for any type of model for navigation cost to be used. We show that the expected rate at which an unknown environment is discovered can be increased in a series of simulations.","authors":["Jason Gregory","Jonathan Fink","John Rogers","Satyandra K Gupta"],"meta":["June 2016","Conference: Planning and Robotics (PlanRob) Workshop at the International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS)At: London, UKVolume: 4"],"references":["281050463_Comparison_of_Task-Allocation_Algorithms_in_Frontier-Based_Multi-Robot_Exploration","224270246_Mobile_robot_exploration_and_map-building_with_continuous_localization","4121843_Exploration_with_active_loop-closing_for_FastSLAM","3972068_An_experiment_in_integrated_exploration","3847261_Collaborative_multi-robot_exploration","324297739_Applied_Statistical_Decision_Theory","270311089_Decision_Theory_An_Introduction_to_the_Mathematics_of_Rationality","263366449_Stochastic_vehicle_routing","257392479_Terrain_traversability_analysis_methods_for_unmanned_ground_vehicles_A_survey","255899327_New_Model_for_Predicting_Freeway_Incidents_and_Incident_Delays","255786431_Building_Large_Scale_Traversability_Maps_Using_Vehicle_Experience","242978896_The_seriation_problem_and_the_travelling_salesman_problem","238180487_Estimating_Magnitude_and_Duration_of_Incident_Delays","233511214_Algorithms_for_a_stochastic_selective_travelling_salesperson_problem","223645133_Vehicle_routing_problems_with_time_windows_and_stochastic_travel_and_service_times_Models_and_algorithm","222236796_A_fast_and_effective_heuristic_for_the_orienteering_problem","220648003_Towards_learned_traversability_for_robot_navigation_From_underfoot_to_the_far_field","220289770_The_orienteering_problem_A_survey","220121802_Learning_from_Demonstration_for_Autonomous_Navigation_in_Complex_Unstructured_Terrain","3706211_A_frontier-based_approach_for_autonomous_exploration","3525220_Planning_under_uncertainty"]}
