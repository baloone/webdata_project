{"id":"320162843_2D_Filtering_of_Curvilinear_Structures_by_Ranking_the_Orientation_Responses_of_Path_Operators_RORPO","abstract":"We present a filtering method for 2D curvilinear structures, called RORPO (Ranking the Orien-tation Responses of Path Operators). RORPO is based on path operators, a recently developed family of mathematical morphology filters. Compared with state of the art methods, RORPO is non-local and well adapted to the intrinsic anisotropy of curvilinear structures. Since RORPO does not depend on a linear scale-space framework, it tends to preserve object contours without a blurring eéct. Due to these properties, RORPO is a useful low-level filter and can also serve as a curvilinear prior in segmentation frameworks. In this article, after introducing RORPO, we develop the 2D version of the algorithm and present a few applications.","authors":["Odyssee Merveille","Benoît Naegel","Hugues Talbot","Laurent Najman"],"meta":["October 2017Image Processing On Line 7:246-261","DOI:10.5201/ipol.2017.207"],"references":["314087538_Curvilinear_Structure_Analysis_by_Ranking_the_Orientation_Responses_of_Path_Operators","257035079_Image-based_mapping_of_surface_fissures_for_the_investigation_of_landslide_dynamics","221961916_Mask-Based_Second_Generation_Connectivity_and_Attribute_Filters","221401076_Muliscale_Vessel_Enhancement_Filtering","221304477_Three_Dimensional_Curvilinear_Structure_Detection_Using_Optimally_Oriented_Flux","315838176_RORPO_A_morphological_framework_for_curvilinear_structure_analysis_Application_to_the_filtering_and_segmentation_of_blood_vessels","279246813_Road_Extraction_Using_SVM_and_Image_Segmentation","255908334_Efficient_Robust_d-Dimensional_Path_Operators","241090516_UAV-based_remote_sensing_of_the_Super-Sauze_landslide_Evaluation_and_results","224122254_Constrained_and_Dimensionality-Independent_Path_Openings"]}
