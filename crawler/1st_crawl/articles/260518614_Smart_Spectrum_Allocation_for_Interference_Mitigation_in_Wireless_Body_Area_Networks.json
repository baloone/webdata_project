{"id":"260518614_Smart_Spectrum_Allocation_for_Interference_Mitigation_in_Wireless_Body_Area_Networks","abstract":"In this paper, a dynamic resource allocation scheme is proposed to avoid interference amongst coexisting Wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN). In the proposed scheme, each WBAN generates a table consisting of interfering nodes from coexisting WBANs in its vicinity. Then each WBAN broadcasts this table to its neighbors, which allows for efficient interpretation of an Interference Region (IR) between each pair of WBANs. The nodes in the IR are later allocated orthogonal sub-channels; whilst nodes that do not exist in the IR can potentially transmit in the same time interval. We further demonstrate a precise tradeoff between the minimum interference level and spatial reuse. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme has far better spectral efficiency compared to the conventional orthogonal schemes, whilst maintaining an acceptable interference level. We also provide mathematical analysis on the proposed scheme to validate its efficiency for increasing spectral efficiency and avoiding interference. To further reduce the interference level, we propose a probabilistic approach, and analytically show that the outage probability can be effectively reduced at the cost of very small change in the spatial reuse factor.","authors":["Samaneh Movassaghi","Mehran Abolhasan","David Smith"],"meta":["June 2014","DOI:10.1109/ICC.2014.6884228","Conference: ICC"],"references":["224574756_A_graph_approach_to_dynamic_fractional_frequency_reuse_FFR_in_multi-cell_OFDMA_networks","224359728_Statistical_characterization_of_the_dynamic_narrowband_body_area_channel","261021281_B_2IRS_A_technique_to_reduce_BAN-BAN_interferences_in_wireless_sensor_networks","260671140_On_the_evolution_of_multi-cell_scheduling_in_3GPP_LTELTE-A","260358194_Coloring-Based_Inter-WBAN_Scheduling_for_Mobile_Wireless_Body_Area_Networks","257811661_Cooperative_body-area-communications_Enhancing_coexistence_without_coordination_between_networks","221575299_Interference_mitigation_for_body_area_networks","221313066_Inter-User_Interference_in_Body_Sensor_Networks_Preliminary_Investigation_and_an_Infrastructure-Based_Solution","221287527_Interference_Analysis_of_Co-Existing_Wireless_Body_Area_Networks","220973238_Graph_coloring_based_spectrum_allocation_for_femtocell_downlink_interference_mitigation"]}
