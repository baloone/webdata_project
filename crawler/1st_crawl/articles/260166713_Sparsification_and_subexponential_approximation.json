{"id":"260166713_Sparsification_and_subexponential_approximation","abstract":"Instance sparsification is well-known in the world of exact computation since\nit is very closely linked to the \\emph{Exponential Time Hypothesis}. In this\npaper, we extend the concept of sparsification in order to capture\nsubexponential time approximation. We develop a new tool for inapproximability,\ncalled approximation preserving sparsification and use it in order to get\nstrong inapproximability results in subexponential time for several fundamental\noptimization problems as Max Independent Set, Min Dominating Set, Min Feedback\nVertex Set, and Min Set Cover.","authors":["Ã‰douard Bonnet","Vangelis Paschos"],"meta":["February 2018Acta Informatica 55(1)","DOI:10.1007/s00236-016-0281-2","SourcearXiv"],"references":["266705535_On_Subexponential_and_FPT-Time_Inapproximability","255731515_Independent_Set_Induced_Matching_and_Pricing_Connections_and_Tight_Subexponential_Time_Approximation_Hardnesses","291049932_Hardness_of_Approximations_in_Approximation_Algorithms_for_NP-Hard_Problems","284039089_Reducibility_among_combinatorial_problems","278619265_Efficient_approximation_of_MIN_SET_COVER_by_low-complexity_exponential_algorithms","278619259_On_the_MAX_k-VERTEX_COVER_problem","268072213_Lower_bounds_based_on_the_exponential_time_hypothesis","268066250_On_the_max_min_vertex_cover_Problem","266515478_Complexity_and_approximation_Combinatorial_optimization_problems_and_their_approximability_properties_Incl_1_CD-ROM","257650163_Invitation_to_Fixed-Parameter_Algorithms","234794393_Proof_Verification_and_the_Hardness_of_Approximation_Problems","226785142_On_Parameterized_Approximability","225449378_Fixed-Parameter_Approximation_Conceptual_Framework_and_Approximability_Results","243787873_Compexity_of_Computer_Computations","242457186_Proof_verification_and_intractability_of_approximation_problems"]}
