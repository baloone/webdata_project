{"id":"341028247_The_Automatic_Generation_of_Arabic_Sentences_Based_on_a_Minimalist_Approach","abstract":"The automatic generation of sentences is a domain of Natural Language Processing (NLP); it is placed in the middle of computer science and linguistics. This is a very complex discipline; the aim of this is to create automatically correct sentences from a list of words which can serve as the basis for such various applications such as automatic translation, question-answering systems, correcting syntactic errors and so on. In this study, we present the use of the linguistic approach of Chomskyâ€™s minimalist grammar. We begin with the elaboration of the lexicon that constitutes the essential link of the generation. Then, based on this lexicon, we treat the merge and move operations to build a syntactically correct sentence.","authors":["Chouaib Moukrim","Abderrahim Tragha","EL Habib Benlahmar"],"meta":["April 2020International Journal of Soft Computing 14(3):68-76","DOI:10.36478/ijscomp.2019.68.76"],"references":["326536797_Revival_of_Bio_Medical_Research_in_The_Muslim_World","268043216_A_Formalization_of_Minimalist_Syntax","221018318_Efficient_Automatic_Correction_of_Misspelled_Arabic_Words_Based_on_Contextual_Information","315628283_A_Web-based_interface_to_calculate_phonotactic_probability_for_words_and_nonwords_in_Modern_Standard_Arabic","272087448_Syntactic_Structures","267666517_The_Minimalist_Program","246142890_Explanatory_Models_in_Linguistics","245800837_Core_Syntax_A_Minimalist_Approach","224982542_Computing_Machinery_and_Intelligence","222689684_Varieties_of_crossing_dependencies_Structure_dependence_and_mild_context_sensitivity","215562456_A_Mathematical_Theory_of_Communications"]}
