{"id":"341812357_Channel_Characterization_and_Modeling_for_Optical_Wireless_Body-Area_Networks","abstract":"We address channel characterization and modeling for medical wireless body-area networks (WBANs) based on the optical wireless technology. We focus on the intra-WBAN communication links, i.e., between a set of medical sensors and a coordination node, placed on the patient’s body. We consider a realistic mobility model, e.g., inside a hospital room, which takes into account the effect of shadowing due to body parts movements and the variations of the underlying channels. To take into account the global and local user mobility, we consider a dynamic model based on a three-dimensional animation of a walk cycle, as well as walk trajectories based on an improved random way-point mobility model. Then, Monte Carlo ray-tracing simulations are performed to obtain the channel impulse responses for different link configurations at different instants of the walk scenarios. We then derive first-and second-order statistics of the channel parameters such as the channel DC gain, delay spread, and coherence time, and furthermore, propose best fit statistical models to describe the distribution of these parameters for a general scenario.","authors":["Oussama Haddad","Mohammad-Ali Khalighi","Stanislav Zvanovec","Mouloud Adel"],"meta":["June 2020IEEE Open Journal of the Communications Society 1(99):761-776","DOI:10.1109/OJCOMS.2020.2999104","Project: Marie Skłodowska-Curie Multi Initial Training Network (ITN) on Visible light based Interoperability and Networking"],"references":["336512259_Experiments_in_Non-Line-of-Sight_Li-Fi_Channels","335585463_Optical_Wireless_Network_Design_for_Off-Body-Sensor_Based_Monitoring","333231652_Patient_Mobility_Support_for_Indoor_Non-Directed_Optical_Body_Area_Networks","329047917_Modeling_the_Random_Orientation_of_Mobile_Devices_Measurement_Analysis_and_LiFi_Use_Case","328435740_A_Mobility_Model_for_Wearable_Antennas_on_Dynamic_Users","323356324_Characterization_of_the_Body-to-Body_Propagation_Channel_for_Subjects_during_Sports_Activities","338960652_Channel_characterization_for_optical_extra-WBAN_links_considering_local_and_global_user_mobility","335240602_Enabling_Communication_Technologies_for_Medical_Wireless_Body-Area_Networks","327865996_Epidemiology_of_Sudden_Cardiac_Death_Global_and_Regional_Perspectives","322006244_Impact_of_physical_and_geometrical_parameters_on_visible_light_communication_links","313549118_Theoretical_and_Experimental_Approach_for_the_Design_of_an_Optical_Wireless_Physical_Activity_Monitoring_System","320153263_Maximum_Step_Length_Test_Performance_in_People_With_Parkinson_Disease_A_Cross-sectional_Study","313444139_MCMC_Methods_for_Realistic_Indoor_Wireless_Optical_Channels_Simulation","312218281_A_Mobile_Channel_Model_for_VLC_and_Application_to_Adaptive_System_Design","308672915_Hardware_Implementations_of_Fixed-Point_Atan2"]}
