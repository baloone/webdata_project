{"id":"316344087_Knowledge_Graph_for_TCM_Health_Preservation_Design_Construction_and_Applications","abstract":"Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is one of the important non-material cultural heritages of the Chinese nation. It is an important development strategy of Chinese medicine to collect, analyzes, and manages the knowledge assets of TCM health care. As a novel and massive knowledge management technology, knowledge graph provides an ideal technical means to solve the problem of “Knowledge Island” in the field of traditional Chinese medicine. In this study, we construct a large-scale knowledge graph, which integrates terms, documents, databases and other knowledge resources. This knowledge graph can facilitate various knowledge services such as knowledge visualization, knowledge retrieval, and knowledge recommendation, and helps the sharing, interpretation, and utilization of TCM health care knowledge.","authors":["Tong Yu","Jinghua Li","Qi Yu","Ye Tian"],"meta":["April 2017Artificial Intelligence in Medicine 77","DOI:10.1016/j.artmed.2017.04.001"],"references":["288366816_Dispersion_behavior_of_CeO2_nano-particles_in_ethanol-water_mixed_solution"]}
