{"id":"321987776_Analysis_by_the_Residual_Method_for_Estimate_Market_Value_of_Land_on_the_Areas_with_Mining_Exploitation_in_Subsoil_under_Future_New_Building","abstract":"This paper attempts to answer some of the following questions: what is the main selling advantage of a plot of land on the areas with mining exploitation? which attributes influence on market value the most? and how calculate the mining influence in subsoil under future new building as market value of plot with commercial use? This focus is not accidental, as the paper sets out to prove that the subsoil load bearing capacity, as directly inferred from the local geotechnical properties with mining exploitation, considerably influences the market value of this type of real estate. Presented in this elaborate analysis and calculations, are part of the ongoing development works which aimed at suggesting a new technology and procedures for estimating the value of the land belonging to the third category geotechnical. Analysed the question was examined both in terms of the theoretical and empirical. On the basis of the analysed code calculations in residual method, numerical, statistical and econometric defined results and final conclusions. A market analysis yielded a group of subsoil stabilization costs which depend on the mining operations interaction, subsoil parameters, type of the contemplated structure, its foundations, selected stabilization method, its overall area and shape.","authors":["Monika Gwóźdź-Lasoń"],"meta":["December 2017IOP Conference Series Earth and Environmental Science 95(4):042064","DOI:10.1088/1755-1315/95/4/042064","Project: Mining damages in building 2013 - 2019"],"references":["318570034_Numerical_fracture_analysis_of_foamed_concrete_beam_using_XFEM_method","316256718_Badanie_i_analiza_ZEI_-_zerowego_etapu_inwestycji_okreslajacego_nosnosc_podloza_gruntowego_jako_atrybutu_majacego_wplyw_na_wartosc_calej_inwestycji_budowlanej_i_determinujacego_istotne_czynniki_wplywa","316256686_Numerical_models_of_the_reinforced_soil","316256570_Trans-disciplinary_concept_of_geotechnical_slope_stability_design","309268780_Foamed_Concrete_Layer_as_Sub-structure_of_Industrial_Concrete_Floor","308992629_Parametry_geotechniczne_wybranych_odpadow_kopalnianych_i_hutniczych_The_use_of_mining_and_metallurgical_waste_with_defined_parameters_on_selected_examples","304424500_Trans-disciplinary_Concept_of_Geotechnical_Slope_Stability_Design"]}
