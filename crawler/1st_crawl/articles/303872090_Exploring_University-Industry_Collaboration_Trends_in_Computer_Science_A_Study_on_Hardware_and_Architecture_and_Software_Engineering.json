{"id":"303872090_Exploring_University-Industry_Collaboration_Trends_in_Computer_Science_A_Study_on_Hardware_and_Architecture_and_Software_Engineering","abstract":"This study aims to examine research collaboration between universities and industry in the field of computer science using bibliometric methods. To further understand the impact of individual countries on university–industry (UI) collaboration, data were retrieved from the computer science journal papers included in the Science Citation Index and published during the period 2002–2011. The density, degree centrality, betweenness centrality, and closeness centrality of UI collaborative networks were calculated in order to ascertain the core countries involved in international UI collaboration. This study investigates university–industry collaborative papers (UI papers) at the global and country levels. At the global level, the results show an increasing trend in UI papers and a stable UI collaboration ratio during the last decade. The average number of authors for UI papers is 4.13, which is higher than that for all other papers. Most UI papers result from two-institution collaboration, but we observed an increase in the number of UI papers produced by multiple universities and industrial entities. At the country level, the results also show that international UI paper collaboration has intensified. Meanwhile, the USA is the dominant collaborative partner with many countries and has produced the highest number of UI papers globally.","authors":["Hsiang Cheng","Chi-Tung Chen","Ling-Fang Wei","Chu-lien Yen"],"meta":["June 2016IETE Technical Review 34(3):1-11","DOI:10.1080/02564602.2016.1185974"],"references":["318795472_The_New_Invisible_College_Science_for_Development","291767477_Longitudinal_Trends_in_Internationalisation_Collaboration_Types_and_Citation_Impact_A_Bibliometric_Analysis_of_Seven_LIS_Journals_1980-2008","285745827_Tracking_Scientometric_Research_in_Taiwan_Using_Bibliometric_and_Content_Analysis","273518306_A_Quantity-Quality_Composite_Ranking_of_Indian_Institutions_in_CS_Research","254440369_Individual_scientific_collaborations_and_firm-level","250199014_Benchmarking_university-industry_research_cooperation_worldwide_Performance_measurements_and_indicators_based_on_co-authorship_data_for_the_world's_largest_univer_sities","240805055_What_do_we_measure_by_co-authorships","234026691_Sectoral_collaboration_in_biomedical_research_and_development","229318061_University-industry_collaboration_in_Italy_A_bibliometric_examination","225838809_Has_globalization_strengthened_South_Korea's_National_Research_System_National_and_international_dynamics_of_the_triple_helix_of_scientific_co-authorship_relationships_in_South_Korea","220365046_Mapping_the_dynamics_of_knowledge_base_of_innovations_of_RD_in_Bangladesh_Triple_helix_perspective","220194913_Publish_or_Perish_in_the_Internet_Age_A_study_of_publication_statistics_in_computer_networking_research","46489009_Longitudinal_Trends_in_Networks_of_University-Industry-Government_Relations_in_South_Korea_The_Role_of_Programmatic_Incentives","45888700_The_Mutual_Information_of_University-Industry-Government_Relations_An_Indicator_of_the_Triple_Helix_Dynamics","45884320_Betweenness_Centrality_as_an_Indicator_of_the_Interdisciplinarity_of_Scientific_Journals","277671031_Publish_or_Perish_in_the_Internet_Age","271995403_Mapping_the_Computer_Science_Research_in_SAARC_Countries","247220383_Pragmatism_and_self-organization","240805003_University-industry_collaboration_The_network_embeddedness_approach","227447453_Links_and_Impacts_The_Influence_of_Public_Research_on_Industrial_RD","227154620_University-Industry_Cooperation_in_the_Context_of_the_European_Framework_Programmes","223529291_American_Universities_and_Technical_Advance_in_Industry","220435195_Collaboration_in_Computer_Science_A_Network_Science_Approach","220365503_Core-periphery_new_clusters_or_rising_stars_International_scientific_collaboration_among_'advanced'_countries_in_the_era_of_globalization","220365335_Tracking_techno-science_networks_A_case_study_of_fuel_cells_and_related_hydrogen_technology_RD_in_Norway","220365017_The_role_of_Chinese_universities_in_enterprise-university_research_collaboration","24045018_Programmers_Professors_and_Parasites_Credit_and_Co-Authorship_in_Computer_Science","23779249_The_limits_to_internationalization_of_scientific_research_collaboration_The_Journal_of_Technology_Transfer_341_76-94"]}
