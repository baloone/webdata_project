{"id":"259893629_Zombie_Politics_Evolutionary_Algorithms_to_Counteract_the_Spread_of_Negative_Opinions","abstract":"This paper is about simulating the spread of opinions in a society and about\nfinding ways to counteract that spread. To abstract away from potentially\nemotionally laden opinions, we instead simulate the spread of a zombie outbreak\nin a society. The virus causing this outbreak is different from traditional\napproaches: it not only causes a binary outcome (healthy vs infected) but\nrather a continuous outcome. To counteract the outbreak, a discrete number of\ninfection-level specific treatments is available. This corresponds to acts of\nmild persuasion or the threats of legal action in the opinion spreading use\ncase. This paper offers a genetic and a cultural algorithm that find the\noptimal mixture of treatments during the run of the simulation. They are\nassessed in a number of different scenarios. It is shown, that albeit far from\nbeing perfect, the cultural algorithm delivers superior performance at lower\ncomputational expense.","authors":["Ronald Hochreiter","Christoph Waldhauser"],"meta":["January 2020Soft Computing 24(1)","DOI:10.1007/s00500-019-04251-5","SourcearXiv"],"references":["339376463_Multi-objective_Evolutionary_Algorithms_for_Influence_Maximization_in_Social_Networks","334593565_Fighting_Opinion_Control_in_Social_Networks_via_Link_Recommendation","328840398_Rumor_propagation_dynamic_model_based_on_evolutionary_game_and_anti-rumor","328819658_Rumor_propagation_meets_skepticism_A_parallel_with_zombies","331084162_An_evolutionary_game_model_for_analysis_of_rumor_propagation_and_control_in_social_networks","324414508_Mathematical_Models_in_Population_Biology_and_Epidemiology","323619462_Improving_Multi-objective_Evolutionary_Influence_Maximization_in_Social_Networks","318393858_R_A_Language_and_Environment_for_Statistical_Computing","318185646_Guided_Genetic_Algorithm_for_the_Influence_Maximization_Problem","314533695_A_Comparison_of_Simulation_Approaches_to_Epidemic_Modeling","304573646_Cost-Efficient_Strategies_for_Restraining_Rumor_Spreading_in_Mobile_Social_Networks","291388066_Maximizing_the_spread_of_positive_influence_in_signed_social_networks","288480372_Blocking_Negative_Influential_Node_Set_in_Social_Networks_From_Host_Perspective","281345608_Ggplot2_Elegant_Graphics_for_Data_Analysis","278851485_The_Dynamic_and_Stochastic_Knapsack_Problem"]}
