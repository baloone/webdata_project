{"id":"317419947_A_graph_based_method_for_Arabic_document_indexing","abstract":"Extracting knowledge from text data and taking its full advantage has been an im-portant way to reduce its computation and accelerate processing, especially for large amounts of data. Thus, different approaches and methodologies for model-ing and representing textual data have been proposed. In this paper, a graph-based approach for automatic indexing of unstructured data from an Arabic cor-pus has been proposed. First, each document in the collection is represented by a graph. After the generation of document graph, term weighting is computed to es-timate the relevance of a term to the document. The graph representation offers the advantage that it allows for a much more expressive document modeling than the standard bag of words approach, and consequently, it improves classification performance. Experimental results show that the graph based indexing method is a promising approach for semantic and contextual indexation, and outperforms statistical based method (TFIDF) by 12% in F-measure.","authors":["Mohamed Salim El Bazzi","D.
