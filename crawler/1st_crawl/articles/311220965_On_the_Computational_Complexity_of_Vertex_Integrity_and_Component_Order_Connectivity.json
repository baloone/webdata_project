The task is to decide if there exists a set such that the weight of X plus the weight of a heaviest component of is at most p. Among other results, we prove thatwVI is NP-complete on co-bipartite graphs, even if each vertex has weight 1; wVI can be solved in time; wVI admits a kernel with at most vertices. wCOC can be solved in time on interval graphs, while the unweighted version can be solved in time on this graph class; wCOC is W[1]-hard on split graphs when parameterized by k or by ; wCOC can be solved in time; wCOC admits a kernel with at most vertices. Result (1) refutes a conjecture by Ray and Deogun (J Comb Math Comb Comput 16: 65-73, 1994) and answers an open question by Ray et al. (Ars Comb 79: 77-95, 2006). It also complements a result by Kratsch et al. (Discret Appl Math 77(3): 259270, 1997), stating that the unweighted version of the problem can be solved in polynomial time on co-comparability graphs of bounded dimension, provided that an intersection model of the input graph is given as part of the input. An instance of the Weighted Component Order Connectivity (wCOC) problem consists of an nvertex graph G, a weight function w : V(G). N, and two integers k and, and the task is to decide if there exists a set X. V(G) such that the weight of X is at most k and the weight of a heaviest component of G -X is at most. In some sense, the wCOC problem can be seen as a refined version of the wVI problem. We obtain several classical and parameterized complexity results on thewCOC problem, uncovering interesting similarities and differences between wCOC and wVI. We prove, among other results, that: (4) wCOC can be solved in O(min{k, n3) time on interval graphs, while the unweighted version can be solved in O(n2) time on this graph class; (5) wCOC is W[ 1]-hard on split graphs when parameterized by k or by (6) wCOC can be solved in 2O(k log ) n time; (7) wCOC admits a kernel with at most k (k +) + k vertices. We also showthat result (6) is essentially tight by proving that wCOC cannot be solved in 2o(k log ) nO(1) time, even when restricted to split graphs, unless the Exponential Time Hypothesis fails.","authors":["Pal Gronas Drange","Markus Dregi","Pim van 't Hof"],"meta":["December 2016Algorithmica 76(4):1181-1202","DOI:10.1007/s00453-016-0127-x"],"references":["220620360_The_Weighted_Integrity_Problem_is_Polynomial_for_Interval_Graphs","220209391_On_the_minimum_cut_separator_problem","316800486_Monographs_in_Computer_Science","297576361_Equitable_colorings_of_bounded_treewidth_graphs","290627532_On_the_Computational_Complexity_of_Vertex_Integrity_and_Component_Order_Connectivity","286393717_A_survey_of_component_order_connectivity_models_of_graph_theoretic_networks","273798010_Graph_Theory","268717551_The_immersion_order_forbidden_subgraphs_and_the_complexity_of_network_integrity","264993463_The_k-Separator_Problem","261363360_Computational_Complexity_of_Integrity","257650162_Computers_and_Intractability","248360443_Vulnerability_in_graphs-A_comparative_survey","245742149_Computational_Complexity_of_Weighted_Integrity","228110121_Graph_Classes_a_Survey","225035759_Graph_Theory","223880346_A_survey_of_integrity","222666128_Which_Problems_Have_Strongly_Exponential_Complexity","222442268_Measuring_the_vulnerability_for_classes_of_intersection_graphs","222309856_Counting_clique_trees_and_computing_perfect_elimination_schemes_in_parallel","222305559_A_Partial_K-Arboretum_of_Graphs_With_Bounded_Treewidth","222125111_Testing_for_the_Consecutive_Ones_Property_Interval_Graphs_and_Graph_Planarity_Using_PQ-Tree_Algorithms","220779154_Slightly_Superexponential_Parameterized_Problems","220661592_Vulnerability_parameters_of_split_graphs","220568999_The_clique-separator_graph_for_chordal_graphs","220193579_The_toughness_of_split_graphs","220188820_Comparability_graphs_and_intersection_graphs","220148877_Equitable_colorings_of_bounded_treewidth_graphs","3801351_Complexity_of_k-SAT"]}
