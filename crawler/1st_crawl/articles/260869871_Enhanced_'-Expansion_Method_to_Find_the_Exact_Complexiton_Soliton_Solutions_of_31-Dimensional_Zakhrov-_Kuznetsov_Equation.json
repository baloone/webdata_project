The efficiency of this method for finding these exact solutions has been demonstrated. As a result, a set of complexiton soliton solutions are derived, which are expressed by the combinations of rational, hyperbolic and trigonometric functions involving several parameters. It is shown that the method is effective and can be used for many other nonlinear evolution equations (NLEEs) in mathematical physics.","authors":["Rafiqul Islam","Kamruzzaman Khan","Professor M.
