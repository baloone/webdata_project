To train a deep learning network, we must collect a sufficient amount of training data. However, it is difficult to collect image datasets required to train the networks to perform object recognition, especially because target items that are to be classified are generally excluded from existing databases, and the manual collection of images poses certain limitations. Therefore, to overcome the data deficiency that is present in many domains including manufacturing, we propose a method of generating new training images via image pre-processing steps, background elimination, target extraction while maintaining the ratio of the object size in the original image, color perturbation considering the predefined similarity between the original and generated images, geometric transformations, and transfer learning. Specifically, to demonstrate color perturbation and geometric transformations, we compare and analyze the experiments of each color space and each geometric transformation. The experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively augment the original data, correctly classify similar items, and improve the image classification accuracy. In addition, it also demonstrates that the effective data augmentation method is crucial when the amount of training data is small.","authors":["Eun Kyeong Kim","Hansoo Lee","Jin Yong Kim","Sungshin Kim"],"meta":["May 2020Applied Sciences 10(11):3755","DOI:10.3390/app10113755"],"references":["338087022_Object_Detection_and_Classification_of_Metal_Polishing_Shaft_Surface_Defects_Based_on_Convolutional_Neural_Network_Deep_Learning","336588039_Deep_Learning_Object-Impulse_Detection_for_Enhancing_Leakage_Detection_of_a_Boiler_Tube_Using_Acoustic_Emission_Signal","334565222_Automatic_Bridge_Crack_Detection_Using_a_Convolutional_Neural_Network","334279066_A_survey_on_Image_Data_Augmentation_for_Deep_Learning","322758593_A_Deep_Learning_Approach_for_Fault_Diagnosis_of_Induction_Motors_in_Manufacturing","340694183_Color_Decision_System_for_Ambiguous_Color_Boundary","326246580_Using_Multiple-Feature-Spaces-Based_Deep_Learning_for_Tool_Condition_Monitoring_in_Ultraprecision_Manufacturing","322325843_Deep_Learning_for_Smart_Manufacturing_Methods_and_Applications","322282188_Research_on_data_augmentation_for_image_classification_based_on_convolution_neural_networks","321044395_A_New_Image_Classification_Method_Using_CNN_transfer_learning_and_Web_Data_Augmentation"]}
