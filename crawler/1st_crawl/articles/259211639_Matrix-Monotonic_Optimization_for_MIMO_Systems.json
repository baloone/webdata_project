{"id":"259211639_Matrix-Monotonic_Optimization_for_MIMO_Systems","abstract":"For MIMO systems, due to the deployment of multiple antennas at transmitter\nand receiver the design variables e.g., precoders, equalizers, training\nsequences, etc are usually matrices. It is natural that matrix operations are\nusually more complicated compared to their vector counterparts. In order to\novercome the high complexity resulting form matrix variables, in this paper we\ninvestigate a class of elegant and powerful optimization problems, namely\nmatrix-monotonic optimization problems (MMOPs). Various famous MIMO\noptimization problems are unified into a framework of MMOPs which includes\nlinear transceiver designs, nonlinear transceiver designs, training sequence\ndesigns, radar waveform optimization, their corresponding robust designs and so\non as its special cases. Moreover, based on the MMOP framework the optimal\nstructures of the considered matrix variables can be derived first. Then based\non the optimal structure, the matrix-variate optimization problems can be\ngreatly simplified into the ones with only vector variables. In particular, the\ndimensionality of the new vector variable is only the smaller number of column\nand row of the original matrix variable. Finally, we also extend our work to\nsome more general cases with multiple matrix variables.","authors":["Chengwen Xing","Shaodan Ma","Yiqing Zhou"],"meta":["December 2013IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing 63(2)","DOI:10.1109/TSP.2014.2373332","SourcearXiv"],"references":["224407539_Worst-Case_Robust_MIMO_Transmission_With_Imperfect_Channel_Knowledge","339500870_Majorization_and_Matrix-Monotone_Functions_in_Wireless_Communications","268617865_MIMO_Transceiver_design_via_majorization_theory_Print_version_of_Foundations_and_Trends_in_Communications_and_Information_Theory_Vol_3_No_4-5_2006","258657970_Distributed_Beamforming_for_Physical-Layer_Security_of_Two-Way_Relay_Networks","254061709_Optimized_One-Way_Relaying_Strategy_With_Outdated_CSI_Quantization_for_Spatial_Multiplexing","254056830_Monotonic_Optimization_Framework_for_Coordinated_Beamforming_in_Multicell_Networks","229058134_Convex_Optimization","227660963_Capacity_of_Multi-antenna_Gaussian_Channels","224396104_Optimal_Training_Sequence_for_MIMO_Wireless_Systems_in_Colored_Environments","224264640_Robust_transceiver_design_for_AF_MIMO_relay_systems_with_column_correlations"]}
