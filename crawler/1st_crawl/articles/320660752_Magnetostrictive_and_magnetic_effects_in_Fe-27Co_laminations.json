{"id":"320660752_Magnetostrictive_and_magnetic_effects_in_Fe-27Co_laminations","abstract":"The present paper deals with the characterization of the magnetostriction of the Fe-27%Co alloy. When this alloy is annealed in the ferritic domain (between 700°C and 940°C) and submitted to a slow cooling, it exhibits a low and isotropic magnetostriction over a wide induction range (±1.5T). One reason that can explain this phenomenon is a high temperature selection of magnetic bi-domains preferentially oriented in the rolling plane. As soon as this material is annealed in the austenitic domain or quenched from the ferritic domain, the low and isotropic magnetostriction disappears giving way to a classical quadratic magnetostrictive behavior.","authors":["Maxime Savary","Olivier Hubert","Anne-Laure Helbert","T.
