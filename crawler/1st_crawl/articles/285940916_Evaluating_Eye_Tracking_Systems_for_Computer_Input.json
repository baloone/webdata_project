{"id":"285940916_Evaluating_Eye_Tracking_Systems_for_Computer_Input","abstract":"When a human uses an eye tracker for computer control, the eye is called upon to do 'double duty'. Not only is it an important sensory input channel, it also provides motor responses to control the computer. This chapter discusses methods of evaluating the interaction. When an eye tracker is used for computer input, how well does the interaction function? Can common tasks be carried out efficiently, quickly, accurately? What is the user's experience? How are alternative interaction methods evaluated and compared to identify those that work well, and deserve further study, and those that work poorly, and should be discarded? These are the sorts of questions that can be answered with a valid and robust methodology for evaluating eye trackers for computer input.","authors":["I.
