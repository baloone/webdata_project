{"id":"280022941_On_the_convergence_of_combined_relaxation_methods_for_variational_inequalities","abstract":"A general approach to constructing iterative methods that solve variational inequalities under mild assumptions is proposed. It is based on combining and modifying ideas contained in various relaxation methods. The conditions under which the proposed methods attain linear convergence or terminate with a solution are also given.","authors":["Igor Konnov"],"meta":["January 1998"],"references":["265635461_Modified_Projection-Type_Methods_for_Monotone_Variational_Inequalities","220588703_Finite-Dimensional_Variational_Inequality_and_Nonlinear_Complementarity_Problems_A_Survey_of_Theory_Algorithms_and_Applications","2311262_QPCOMP_A_Quadratic_Programming_Based_Solver_for_Mixed_Complementarity_Problems","285355256_A_modification_of_the_extragradient_method_for_the_solution_of_variational_inequalities_and_some_optimization_problems","284378846_New_trends_in_the_development_of_non-continuous_optimization","268500614_New_trends_in_development_of_nonsmooth_optimization_methods","267080951_An_iterative_algorithm_for_the_variational_inequality_problem","266506846_The_convergence_of_proximal_methods_to_fixed_points_of_extremal_mappings_and_estimates_of_their_rate_of_convergence","266014652_A_Projection_and_Contraction_Method_for_the_Nonlinear_Complementarity_Problem_and_Its_Extensions","265998228_A_finite_solution_method_for_systems_of_convex_inequalities","260424723_Combined_relaxation_methods_for_finding_equilibrium_points_and_solving_related_problems","251273377_A_new_step-size_skill_for_solving_a_class_of_nonlinear_projection_equations","248304064_Variational_and_Quasivariational_Inequalities_Applications_to_Free_Boundary_Problems","238123241_An_extragradient_method_for_finding_saddle_points_and_other_problems","227211155_Some_continuity_properties_of_polyhedral_multifunctions","226902551_Global_Convergence_Of_Descent_Processes_For_Solving_Non_Strictly_Monotone_Variational_Inequalities","226246730_A_Class_of_Combined_Iterative_Methods_for_Solving_Variational_Inequalities","225937659_On_the_resolution_of_monotone_complementarity_problems","225822519_A_class_of_iterative_methods_for_solving_nonlinear_projection_equations","223227758_On_the_convergence_of_descent_methods_for_monotone_variational_inequalities","222276877_On_linear_convergence_of_iterative_method_for_the_variational_inequality_problem","220589868_Modified_Newton_methods_for_solving_a_semismooth_reformulation_of_monotone_complementarity_problems","220589718_A_nonsmooth_inexact_Newton_method_for_the_solution_of_large-scale_nonlinear_complementarity_problems","220588750_NESQP_A_robust_algorithm_for_the_nonlinear_complementarity_problem","2290156_Engineering_And_Economic_Applications_Of_Complementarity_Problems"]}
