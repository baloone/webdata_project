{"id":"336178904_Zombi_A_phylogenetic_simulator_of_trees_genomes_and_sequences_that_accounts_for_dead_linages","abstract":"Results: \nHere we present Zombi, a tool to simulate the evolution of species, genomes and sequences in silico, that considers for the first time the evolution of genomes in extinct lineages. It also incorporates various features that have not to date been combined in a single simulator, such as the possibility of generating species trees with a pre-defined variation of speciation and extinction rates through time, simulating explicitly intergenic sequences of variable length and outputting gene tree - species tree reconciliations.\n\nAvailability: \nSource code and manual are freely available in https://github.com/AADavin/ZOMBI/.\n\nSupplementary information: \nSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","authors":["Adrián Davín","Théo Tricou","Eric Tannier","Damien M de Vienne"],"meta":["September 2019Bioinformatics 36(4)","DOI:10.1093/bioinformatics/btz710"],"references":["325178442_RecPhyloXML_-_a_format_for_reconciled_gene_trees","324162693_Horizontal_gene_transfer_constrains_the_timing_of_methanogen_evolution","324162684_Gene_transfers_can_date_the_Tree_of_Life","302922517_Breaking_Good_Accounting_for_Fragility_of_Genomic_Regions_in_Rearrangement_Distance_Estimation","296193199_ETE_3_Reconstruction_Analysis_and_Visualization_of_Phylogenomic_Data","283493643_SimPhy_Phylogenomic_Simulation_of_Gene_Locus_and_Species_Trees","282130271_Pyvolve_A_Flexible_Python_Module_for_Simulating_Sequences_along_Phylogenies","335922369_SaGePhy_an_improved_phylogenetic_simulation_framework_for_gene_and_subgene_evolution","327853043_Horizontal_transfer_of_antibiotic_resistance_genes_in_clinical_environments","317063253_Integrative_modeling_of_gene_and_genome_evolution_roots_the_archaeal_tree_of_life"]}
