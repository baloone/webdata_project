{"id":"320385975_PageRank-based_prediction_of_award-winning_researchers_and_the_impact_of_citations","abstract":"In this article some recent disputes about the usefulness of PageRank-based methods for the\ntask of identifying influential researchers in citation networks are discussed. In particular, it\nfocuses on the performance of these methods in relation to simple citation counts. With the\naim of comparing these two classes of ranking methods, we analyze a large citation network\nof authors based on almost two million computer science papers and apply four PageRank-based\nand citations-based techniques to rank authors by importance throughout the period\n1990â€“2014 on a yearly basis. We use ACM SIGMOD E. F. Codd Innovations Award and\nACM A. M. Turing Award winners in our baseline lists of outstanding scientists and define\nfour relevance weighting schemes with some predictive power for the ranking methods\nto increase the relevance of researchers winning in the future. We conclude that citations-based\nrankings perform better for Codd Award winners, but PageRank-based methods do\nso for Turing Award recipients when using absolute ranks and PageRank-based rankings\noutperform the citations-based techniques for both Codd and Turing Award laureates when\nrelative ranks are considered. However, the two ranking groups show smaller differences\nif more weight is assigned to the relevance of future awardees.","authors":["Dalibor Fiala","Gabriel Tutoky"],"meta":["October 2017Journal of Informetrics 11(4):1044-1068","DOI:10.1016/j.joi.2017.09.008","Project: Modern informetric methods for the evaluation of scientific research"],"references":["262346065_A_Brief_Survey_of_Automatic_Methods_for_Author_Name_Disambiguation","298723894_Evaluating_paper_and_author_ranking_algorithms_using_impact_and_contribution_awards","271404972_Topic-based_Pagerank_Toward_a_topic-level_scientific_evaluation","236147351_Eigenfactor_Measuring_the_value_and_prestige_of_scholarly_journals","222298156_Finding_scientific_gems_with_Google's_PageRank_algorithm","220515689_Cumulated_Gain-Based_Evaluation_of_IR_Techniques","200111047_Inside_PageRank","200047922_The_Anatomy_of_a_Large-Scale_Hypertextual_Web_Search_Engine","48204333_Applying_Weighted_PageRank_to_Author_Citation_Networks","48173201_PageRank_for_Ranking_Authors_in_Co-citation_Networks"]}
