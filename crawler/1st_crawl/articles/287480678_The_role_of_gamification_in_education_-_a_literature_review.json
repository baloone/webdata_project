A lot of research is ongoing since it seeks to improve the quality of learning of students. Current situation on research of \"Gamification in education\" is still at initial stages where all of them aim to improve the effectiveness of education activity using game elements. Several gaps on the studiesdone on gamification in education have been identified.
