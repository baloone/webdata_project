{"id":"281458572_Classification_of_Fault_Clearing_Strategies_for_HVDC_Grids","abstract":"This paper defines and classifies fault clearing strategies for HVDC grid protection, based on the method of fault current interruption. HVDC grid protection must act on a much shorter timescale than AC grid protection and faces the challenge to interrupt fast rising fault currents without natural zero crossings. Conversely, the HVDC grid protection equipment, such as HVDC breakers or converters with fault blocking capability, offers several degrees of freedom for fault clearing strategies for HVDC grid protection. However, each of these strategies fulfils different objectives and imposes different requirements on HVDC grid components. Therefore, a classification of fault clearing strategies is needed. In this paper, the objectives and requirements for HVDC grid protection are described. Furthermore, constraints on HVDC grid protection are given. Available methods for fault current interruption and protective relaying algorithms are briefly reviewed. Different classes of fault clearing strategies are defined and the options for fault current interruption and protective relaying algorithm for each strategy are given.","authors":["Willem Leterme","Dirk Van Hertem"],"meta":["May 2015","Conference: Cigre Lund SymposiumAt: Lund"],"references":[]}
