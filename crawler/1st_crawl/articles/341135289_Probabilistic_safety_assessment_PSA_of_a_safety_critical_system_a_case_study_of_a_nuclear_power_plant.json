{"id":"341135289_Probabilistic_safety_assessment_PSA_of_a_safety_critical_system_a_case_study_of_a_nuclear_power_plant","abstract":"Probabilistic Safety Assessment approach has been successfully applied in engineering, economics, computer science, and statistics to resolve a wide range of safety-related problems. However, using the Probabilistic Safety Assessment for quantifying the safety of a safety-critical system is a challenging task in the Safety Engineering community. This method plays an essential role in analyzing the safety of safety-critical systems and its various components. Therefore, in this paper, we present a Probabilistic Safety Assessment framework that can be used to quantify the critical failures of a system. The approach is well demonstrated on a Digital Feed Water Control System uses in a Nuclear Power Plant as a safety-critical system.","authors":["Vinay Kumar","Dewanshu Pratihar","Anil Kumar Tripathi"],"meta":["April 2018International Journal of Engineering and Technology 7(2):210-213","DOI:10.14419/ijet.v7i2.12.11281"],"references":["255280454_A_review_of_software-induced_failure_experience","318907162_Reliability_Analysis_of_safety-critical_and_control_systems_A_state-of-the-art_review","318382478_Safety_Analysis_of_Safety-Critical_Systems_Using_State-Space_Models","315322365_Transformation_of_deterministic_models_into_state_space_models_for_safety_analysis_of_safety_critical_systems_A_case_study_of_NPP","312009964_A_Probabilistic_Hazard_Assessment_Framework_for_Safety-Critical_and_Control_Systems_A_Case_Study_for_a_Nuclear_Power_Plant","273498204_Modeling_of_Safety-Critical_Systems_Using_Petri_Nets","255199728_ISSUES_ASSOCIATED_WITH_PROBABILISTIC_FAILURE_MODELING_OF_DIGITAL_SYSTEMS","229000680_The_Role_of_Software_in_Recent_Catastrophic_Accidents","2411640_Failure_Correlation_in_Software_Reliability_Models"]}
