{"id":"331154188_Threshold_models_of_social_influence","abstract":"This article explores threshold models of social influence, with a particular focus on the consequences of simple heuristics in the context of social influence on collective decision-making processes. It first provides an overview of social-influence and threshold models before discussing influence cascades on complete and random networks. It then considers cascades in networks that emphasize the importance of social groups in the formation of influence networks, namely random-group networks and generalized-affiliation networks. It also describes cascade-seeding strategies and demonstrates how the structure of influence networks shapes the roles of individual actors (prominent or not) in the generation of collective behavior, including wild cascades of influence.","authors":["D.J.
