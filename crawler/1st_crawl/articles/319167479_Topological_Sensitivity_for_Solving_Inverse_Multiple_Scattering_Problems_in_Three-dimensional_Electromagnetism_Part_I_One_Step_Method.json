{"id":"319167479_Topological_Sensitivity_for_Solving_Inverse_Multiple_Scattering_Problems_in_Three-dimensional_Electromagnetism_Part_I_One_Step_Method","abstract":"In this paper we compute closed-form expressions for the topological derivative for three-dimensional time-harmonic electromagnetic waves for perfect conductors (Dirichlet condition), electromagnetic cavities (Neumann condition), absorbing obstacles (impedance condition), and dielectric inclusions (transmission conditions). The proofs are based on the computation of shape derivatives followed by asymptotic expansions using Mie series when infinitesimal spheres are considered. An exhaustive gallery of numerical experiments is presented, which demonstrate that the topological derivative is a very powerful tool for the detection of multiple electromagnetic scatterers without a priori information about their number, size, shape, or location. Numerical examples include highly demanding configurations where only a few incident directions and a few observation points (for near-field data) or a few far-field observation directions (for far-field data) are considered.","authors":["Frédérique Le Louër","Maria-Luisa Rapun"],"meta":["January 2017SIAM Journal on Imaging Sciences 10(3):1291-1321","DOI:10.1137/17M1113850"],"references":["323117935_A_spectrally_accurate_method_for_the_direct_and_inverse_scattering_problems_by_multiple_3D_dielectric_obstacles","308831598_Noninvasive_Imaging_of_Three-Dimensional_Micro_and_Nanostructures_by_Topological_Methods","269565483_Stability_and_Resolution_Analysis_of_Topological_Derivative_Based_Localization_of_Small_Electromagnetic_Inclusions","265461253_On_the_Topological_Derivative_in_Shape_Optimization","235731369_The_Topological_Asymptotic_for_the_Helmholtz_Equation_with_Dirichlet_Condition_on_the_Boundary_of_an_Arbitrarily_Shaped_Hole","231116603_Analysis_of_two_linear_sampling_methods_applied_to_electromagnetic_imaging_of_buried_objects","231102645_Solving_inhomogeneous_inverse_problems_by_topological_derivative_methods","231089092_The_topological_asymptotic_expansion_for_the_Maxwell_equations_and_some_application","231006182_The_linear_sampling_method_in_inverse_electromagnetic_scattering_theory","229047159_A_simple_mesh_generator_in_MATLAB","228865527_Sampling_methods_for_low-frequency_electromagnetic_imaging","225171661_Boundary_Element_Methods_for_Maxwell_Transmission_Problems_in_Lipschitz_Domains","220259558_Stability_and_Resolution_Analysis_for_a_Topological_Derivative_Based_Imaging_Functional","220146054_Determining_Planar_Multiple_Sound-Soft_Obstacles_from_Scattered_Acoustic_Fields","51891338_Shape_Derivatives_of_Boundary_Integral_Operators_in_Electromagnetic_Scattering_Part_II_Application_to_Scattering_by_a_Homogeneous_Dielectric_Obstacle","43154949_The_point-source_method_for_3D_reconstructions_for_the_Helmholtz_and_Maxwell_equations","38385098_Fast_Methods_for_Three-dimensional_Inverse_Obstacle_Scattering_Problems","1907159_A_Global_Uniqueness_for_Formally_Determined_Inverse_Electromagnetic_Obstacle_Scattering","324299294_Handbook_of_Mathematical_Functions_with_Formulas_Graphs_and_Mathematical_Tables","323621502_Topological_Sensitivity_for_Solving_Inverse_Multiple_Scattering_Problems_in_Three-Dimensional_Electromagnetism_Part_II_Iterative_Method","305331154_Material_derivatives_of_boundary_integral_operators_in_electromagnetism_and_application_to_inverse_scattering_problems","286623442_Detection_of_Electromagnetic_Inclusions_Using_Topological_Sensitvity","266540967_Numerical_Reconstruction_of_Electromagnetic_Inclusions_in_Three_Dimensions","264459920_Spectrally_accurate_numerical_solution_of_hypersingular_boundary_integral_equations_for_three-dimensional_electromagnetic_wave_scattering_problems","258681070_The_domain_derivative_of_time-harmonic_electromagnetic_waves_at_interfaces","246192858_Finite_Element_Methods_For_Maxwell's_Equations","243684944_Analysis_of_Radiative_Scattering_for_Multiple_Sphere_Configurations","237209655_Asymptotic_formulas_for_perturbations_in_the_electromagnetic_fields_due_to_the_presence_of_inhomogeneities_of_small_diameter_II_The_full_Maxwell_equations","231957099_Boundary_integral_equations_for_the_scattering_of_electromagnetic_waves_by_a_homogeneous_dielectric_obstacle","231150985_The_factorization_method_for_Maxwell's_equations","231127680_A_new_method_in_inverse_scattering_based_on_the_topological_derivative","231016184_Level_set_methods_for_inverse_scattering","230962161_Level_set_methods_for_inverse_scattering-some_recent_developments","229963633_Domain_Derivatives_in_Electromagnetic_Scattering","228102725_Multi-frequency_topological_derivative_for_approximate_shape_acquisition_of_curve-like_thin_electromagnetic_inhomogeneities","222700824_A_high-order_tangential_basis_algorithm_for_electromagnetic_scattering_by_curved_surfaces","222677273_A_high-order_algorithm_for_obstacle_scattering_in_three_dimensions","222557363_From_imaging_to_material_identification_A_generalized_concept_of_topological_sensitivity","220411709_A_Hybrid_High-Order_Algorithm_for_Radar_Cross_Section_Computations","220393561_A_high-order_algorithm_for_multiple_electromagnetic_scattering_in_three_dimensions","220222620_On_the_Frechet_Derivative_for_Obstacle_Scattering_with_an_Impedance_Boundary_Condition","220206715_Topological_derivative_strategy_for_one-step_iteration_imaging_of_arbitrary_shaped_thin_curve-like_electromagnetic_inclusions","29626023_Small-inclusion_asymptotic_of_misfit_functionals_for_inverse_problems_in_acoustics","3010796_A_boundary-element_solution_of_the_Leontovitch_problem"]}
