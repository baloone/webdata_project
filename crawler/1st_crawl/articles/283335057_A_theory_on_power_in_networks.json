{"id":"283335057_A_theory_on_power_in_networks","abstract":"The eigenvector centrality equation $\\lambda x = A \\, x$ is a successful\ncompromise between simplicity and expressivity. It claims that central actors\nare those connected with central others. For at least 70 years, this equation\nhas been explored in disparate contexts, including econometrics, sociometry,\nbibliometrics, Web information retrieval, and network science. We propose an\nequally elegant counterpart: the power equation $x = A x^{\\div}$, where\n$x^{\\div}$ is the vector whose entries are the reciprocal of those of $x$. It\nasserts that power is in the hands of those connected with powerless others. It\nis meaningful, for instance, in bargaining situations, where it is advantageous\nto be connected to those who have few options. We tell the parallel, mostly\nunexplored story of this intriguing equation.","authors":["Massimo Franceschet","Enrico Bozzo"],"meta":["October 2015Communications of the ACM 59(11)","DOI:10.1145/2934665","SourcearXiv"],"references":["259367759_Vulnerability_and_power_on_networks","248519014_An_Information_Flow_Model_for_Conflict_and_Fission_in_Small_Groups1","244508407_The_Distribution_of_Power_in_Exchange_Networks","221590171_Balanced_outcomes_in_social_exchange_networks","23750813_Community_Structure_in_Jazz","7933747_Identifying_the_role_that_animals_play_in_their_social_networks","280625612_Order_Independence_and_factor_convergence_in_iterative_scaling","275701130_Connecting_the_Dots","270308708_Combinatorial_Matrix_Theory","268069613_Combinatorial_matrix_theory_Reprint_of_the_1991_hardback_ed","247218489_Power_in_Exchange_Networks_A_Power-Dependence_Formulation","242985556_Order_independence_and_factor_convergence_in_iterative_scaling","229124516_Power_and_Centrality_A_Family_of_Measures","228108240_The_Bargaining_Problem","222808245_Symmetrically_pairwise-bargained_allocations_in_an_assignment_market","222583068_Matrices_of_0's_and_1's_with_total_support","220779628_The_Stanford_GraphBase_A_platform_for_combinatorial_algorithms","220694433_The_Stanford_GraphBase_A_platform_for_combinatorial_computing","220693394_Networks_Crowds_and_Markets_Reasoning_About_A_Highly_Connected_World","220078389_The_DAD_Theorem_for_Symmetric_Non-negative_Matrices","215915666_Power-Dependence_Relations","45911599_Bargaining_dynamics_in_exchange_networks","45901197_PageRank_Standing_on_the_Shoulders_of_Giants","38346604_Concerning_nonnegative_matrices_and_doubly_stochastic_matrices","30815668_A_Fast_Algorithm_for_Matrix_Balancing","7659762_Finding_and_Evaluating_Community_Structure_in_Networks","4894351_The_Bargaining_Problem","2182198_Identifying_the_role_that_animals_play_in_their_social_networks"]}
