{"id":"259755254_Supporting_the_Review_of_Student_Proposal_Drafts_in_Information_Technologies","abstract":"In many cases, academic programs or courses conclude with a thesis or research proposal text, elaborated by students. The review of such texts is a heavy load, especially at initial stages of drafting. This paper proposes a model that allows linguistic and structural review of some essential elements in proposal drafts of undergraduate students. The model aims to support the review from vocabulary to the argumentation in the draft, and is part of an intelligent tutor to monitor student progress. This work presents the initial results in terms of lexical and global coherence analysis of proposal drafts of students. Lexical analysis is done in terms of lexical density, lexical diversity, and sophistication. Global coherence is evaluated using the Latent Semantic Analysis technique. Our results show that the level reached so far by the analyzer is adequate to support the review, taking into account for one section the level of agreement with human reviewers.","authors":["Samuel González-López","Aurelio Lopez-Lopez"],"meta":["October 2012","DOI:10.1145/2380552.2380614","Conference: Proceedings of the 13th Annual Conference on Information Technology EducationAt: Calgary, Alberta, Canada","Project: Linguistic Analysis of Research Drafts of Undergraduate Students"],"references":["262518389_EVALUACION_AUTOMATICA_DE_COHERENCIA_TEXTUAL_EN_NOTICIAS_POLICIALES_UTILIZANDO_ANALISIS_SEMANTICO_LATENTE","224238623_Thermo-Tutor_An_Intelligent_Tutoring_System_for_thermodynamics","221260897_A_Probabilistic_Relational_Student_Model_for_Virtual_Laboratories","313051962_A_concise_model_of_cohesion_in_text_and_coherence_in_comprehension","287894217_Analysis_of_lexical_richness_in_the_context_of_latent_demographic_user_attributes_classification","250371683_Un_modelo_conciso_de_cohesion_en_el_texto_y_coherencia_en_la_comprension","220875004_Modeling_Local_Coherence_An_Entity-Based_Approach","220874635_Reading_Level_Assessment_Using_Support_Vector_Machines_and_Statistical_Language_Models","220817159_Using_Entity-Based_Features_to_Model_Coherence_in_Student_Essays","220813255_Automatic_Evaluation_of_Text_Coherence_Models_and_Representations"]}
