{"id":"290527828_A_Class_of_Three-Weight_Linear_Codes_and_Their_Complete_Weight_Enumerators","abstract":"Recently, linear codes constructed from defining sets have been investigated\nextensively and they have many applications. In this paper, for an odd prime\n$p$, we propose a class of $p$-ary linear codes by choosing a proper defining\nset. Their weight enumerators and complete weight enumerators are presented\nexplicitly. The results show that they are linear codes with three weights and\nsuitable for the constructions of authentication codes and secret sharing\nschemes.","authors":["Yang Shudi","Zheng-an Yao","Chang-An Zhao"],"meta":["January 2017Cryptography and Communications 9(1)","DOI:10.1007/s12095-016-0187-4","SourcearXiv"],"references":["301312308_Complete_weight_enumerators_of_a_class_of_linear_codes","290478395_Complete_weight_distributions_of_two_classes_of_cyclic_codes","282452922_Complete_weight_enumerators_of_some_linear_codes_and_their_applications","281576579_Complete_Weight_Enumerators_of_a_Family_of_Three-Weight_Linear_Codes","277947569_Recent_progress_on_weight_distributions_of_cyclic_codes_over_finite_fields","316560047_Codes_from_Difference_Sets","312433866_Complete_weight_enumerators_of_generalized_Kerdock_code_and_linear_recursive_codes_over_Galois_rings","308869542_Complete_weight_enumerators_of_a_class_of_three-weight_linear_codes","291186553_Linear_Codes_With_Two_or_Three_Weights_From_Weakly_Regular_Bent_Functions","288060319_Complete_weight_enumerators_of_two_classes_of_linear_codes","274012459_A_Class_of_Two-Weight_and_Three-Weight_Codes_and_Their_Applications_in_Secret_Sharing","276443210_Complete_weight_enumerators_of_some_cyclic_codes","274012549_Linear_Codes_From_Some_2-Designs","273836298_The_weight_enumerators_of_several_classes_of_-ary_cyclic_codes","273395796_Binary_Linear_Codes_With_Three_Weights"]}
