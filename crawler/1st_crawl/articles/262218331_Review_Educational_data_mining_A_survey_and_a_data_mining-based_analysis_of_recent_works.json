{"id":"262218331_Review_Educational_data_mining_A_survey_and_a_data_mining-based_analysis_of_recent_works","abstract":"This review pursues a twofold goal, the first is to preserve and enhance the chronicles of recent educational data mining (EDM) advances development; the second is to organize, analyze, and discuss the content of the review based on the outcomes produced by a data mining (DM) approach. Thus, as result of the selection and analysis of 240 EDM works, an EDM work profile was compiled to describe 222 EDM approaches and 18 tools. A profile of the EDM works was organized as a raw data base, which was transformed into an ad-hoc data base suitable to be mined. As result of the execution of statistical and clustering processes, a set of educational functionalities was found, a realistic pattern of EDM approaches was discovered, and two patterns of value-instances to depict EDM approaches based on descriptive and predictive models were identified. One key finding is: most of the EDM approaches are ground on a basic set composed by three kinds of educational systems, disciplines, tasks, methods, and algorithms each. The review concludes with a snapshot of the surveyed EDM works, and provides an analysis of the EDM strengths, weakness, opportunities, and threats, whose factors represent, in a sense, future work to be fulfilled.","authors":["Alejandro Pe√±a-Ayala"],"meta":["March 2014Expert Systems with Applications 41(4):1432-1462","DOI:10.1016/j.eswa.2013.08.042","Project: Artificial Intelligence on
