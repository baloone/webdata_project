{"id":"317687476_A_Shifting_Framework_for_Set_Queries","abstract":"Abstractâ€”Set queries are fundamental operations in computer\nnetworks. This paper addresses the fundamental problem of designing\na probabilistic data structure that can quickly process set\nqueries using a small amount of memory. We propose a Shifting\nBloom Filter (ShBF) framework for representing and querying\nsets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ShBF using three types\nof popular set queries: membership, association, and multiplicity\nqueries. The key novelty of ShBF is on encoding the auxiliary\ninformation of a set element in a location offset. In contrast,\nprior BF based set data structures allocate additional memory\nto store auxiliary information. We further extend our shifting\nframework from BF based data structures to sketch based data\nstructures, which are widely used to store multiplicities of items.\nWe conducted experiments using real-world network traces, and\nresults show that ShBF significantly advances the state-of-the-art\non all three types of set queries.","authors":["Tong Yang","Alex X.
