{"id":"259431864_Improved_bound_for_complexity_of_matrix_multiplication","abstract":"We give a new bound Ï‰ < 2.37369 for the exponent of complexity of matrix multiplication, giving a small improvement on the previous bound obtained by Coppersmith and Winograd. The proof involves an extension of the method used by these authors. We have attempted to make the exposition self-contained.","authors":["A. M.
