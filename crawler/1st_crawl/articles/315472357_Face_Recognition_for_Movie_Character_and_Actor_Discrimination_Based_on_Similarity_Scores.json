{"id":"315472357_Face_Recognition_for_Movie_Character_and_Actor_Discrimination_Based_on_Similarity_Scores","abstract":"A novel face recognition approach dedicated to discriminate between movie characters and actors is presented in the paper. In presented approach, faces are categorized according to similarities determined with regard to their ORB feature descriptors. Constituent procedures, including face normalization, descriptors computation as well as feature matching and similarity discovering are described accurately. Results of their examination are then also reported in details. An exemplary application of the presented approach within the IMCOP platform is presented as well.","authors":["Remigiusz Baran","Filip Rudzinski","Andrzej Zeja"],"meta":["December 2016","DOI:10.1109/CSCI.2016.0249","Conference: 2016 International Conference on Computational Science and Computational Intelligence (CSCI)","Project: Intelligent Multimedia System for Web and IPTV Archiving"],"references":["300707562_Generalized_Tree-Like_Self-Organizing_Neural_Networks_with_Dynamically_Defined_Neighborhood_for_Cluster_Analysis","283192953_Handling_fuzzy_systems'_accuracy-interpretability_trade-off_by_means_of_multi-objective_evolutionary_optimization_methods_-_Selected_problems","275034258_A_Smart_Camera_for_Traffic_Surveillance","264540849_Piecewise-linear_subband_coding_scheme_for_fast_image_decomposition","254024970_Perceptual_quality_assessment_for_H264AVC_compression","300414742_The_IMCOP_System_for_Data_Enrichment_and_Content_Discovery_and_Delivery","283830059_A_multi-objective_genetic_optimization_of_interpretability-oriented_fuzzy_rule-based_classifiers","224386152_A_SOA-Driven_Content_Discovery_and_Retrieval_Platform","221185038_Cluster_Analysis_Via_Dynamic_Self-organizing_Neural_Networks"]}
