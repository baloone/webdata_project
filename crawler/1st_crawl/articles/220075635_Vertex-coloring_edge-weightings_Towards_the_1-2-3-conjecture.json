{"id":"220075635_Vertex-coloring_edge-weightings_Towards_the_1-2-3-conjecture","abstract":"A weighting of the edges of a graph is called vertex- coloring if the weighted degrees of the vertices yield a proper col- oring of the graph. In this paper we show that such a weighting is possible from the weight setf1; 2; 3; 4; 5g for all graphs not con- taining components with exactly 2 vertices.","authors":["Maciej Kalkowski","Michał Karoński","Florian Pfender"],"meta":["May 2010Journal of Combinatorial Theory Series B 100(3):347-349","DOI:10.1016/j.jctb.2009.06.002","SourceDBLP"],"references":["242793334_Edge_weights_and_vertex_colors","226963348_On_vertex-coloring_13-edge-weighting","220570958_Degree_constrained_subgraphs","220441404_Vertex-Colouring_Edge-Weightings","6128491_NT-3_Expression_in_Spared_DRG_and_the_Associated_Spinal_Laminae_as_well_as_Its_Anterograde_Transport_in_Sensory_Neurons_Following_Removal_of_Adjacent_DRG_in_Cats"]}
