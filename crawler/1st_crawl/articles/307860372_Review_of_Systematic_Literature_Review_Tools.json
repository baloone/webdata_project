{"id":"307860372_Review_of_Systematic_Literature_Review_Tools","abstract":"Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs) still suffers from the lack of complete tool support for all phases of the process. This report describes the SLR tools that have been reported in the literature. For each tool, the report describes the features and limitations. To compile this data, we first searched the software engineering literature databases for papers that reported about an SLR tool or the use of a tool for conducting a SLR. After filtering the results and going through each paper we prepared a list of features and limitations for each tool and classified each tool based on the SLR stage(s) it supports. After compiling our initial information, we sent the tool reports to the tool authors for validation. We incorporated any changes returned. We used these reports as part of the SLR Community Workshop held prior to the EASE â€™14 conference (http://carver.cs.ua.edu/SLR). The following subsections provide details about each tool identified in the literature.","authors":["Ahmed Al-Zubidy","Jeffrey C.
