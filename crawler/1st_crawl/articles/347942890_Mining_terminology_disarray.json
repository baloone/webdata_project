{"id":"347942890_Mining_terminology_disarray","abstract":"The 20th Century is deservedly considered as the most technologically advanced in the human history. This is not only because of aerospace, communications, computer sciences, etc., but mining as well. A short list of technologies which have emerged within that time includes solution mining, coal gasification, in-situ leaching, borehole mining, O&G stimulation and several more. Many great scientists and engineers contributed their talent and experience in the commercial success of these technologies. There's an abundance of mining-related scientific and engineering publications, presentations, internet blogs, and alike.\n\nMeanwhile, due to the large number of different scientific and engineering schools and their world-wide geography, there is a certain muddle and confusion in this modern mining processes terminology. There are situations when the same process has more than one name and visa-versa, two or more different processes have the same title. This work is an attempt to clarify and bring in order some mining terminology based on existing and prevalent terms, meanings and definitions.","authors":["Greg Abramov"],"meta":["August 2019","Project: Mining terminology disarray"],"references":["293547629_Borehole_mining_-_Environmentally_friendly_underused"]}
