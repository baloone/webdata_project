{"id":"225391142_Adaptive_weighted-sum_method_for_bi-objective_optimization_Pareto_front_generation","abstract":"This paper presents a new method that effectively determines a Pareto front for bi-objective optimization with potential application to multiple objectives. A traditional method for multiobjective optimization is the weighted-sum method, which seeks Pareto optimal solutions one by one by systematically changing the weights among the objective functions. Previous research has shown that this method often produces poorly distributed solutions along a Pareto front, and that it does not find Pareto optimal solutions in non-convex regions. The proposed adaptive weighted sum method focuses on unexplored regions by changing the weights adaptively rather than by using a priori weight selections and by specifying additional inequality constraints. It is demonstrated that the adaptive weighted sum method produces well-distributed solutions, finds Pareto optimal solutions in non-convex regions, and neglects non-Pareto optimal solutions. This last point can be a potential liability of Normal Boundary Intersection, an otherwise successful multiobjective method, which is mainly caused by its reliance on equality constraints. The promise of this robust algorithm is demonstrated with two numerical examples and a simple structural optimization problem.","authors":["Il Yong Kim","Olivier Ladislas de Weck"],"meta":["February 2005Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization 29(2):149-158","DOI:10.1007/s00158-004-0465-1"],"references":["226610749_A_Closer_Look_at_Drawbacks_of_Minimizing_Weighted_Sums_of_Objectives_for_Pareto_Set_Generation_in_Multicriteria_Optimization_Problems","24302448_Normal-Boundary_Intersection_An_Alternate_Method_for_Generating_Pareto_Optimal_Points_in_Multicriteria_Optimization_Problems","2460803_Normal-Boundary_Intersection_A_New_Method_for_Generating_the_Pareto_Surface_in_Nonlinear_Multicriteria_Optimization_Problems","283996103_Genetic_Algorithms_In_Search_Optimization_and_Machine_Learning","270419176_Public_Investment_Criteria_Benefit-Cost_Analysis_for_Planned_Economic_Growth_Studies_in_the_Economic_Development_of_India","268246068_Multicriteria_Truss_Optimization","265777296_Multicriteria_Optimization_Methods_for_Design_of_Aircraft_Control_Systems","265505614_Multiple_criteria_optimization_theory_computation_and_application_Reprint_with_corr_of_the_orig_publ_by_Wiley_1986","255603421_Normal_Constraint_Method_with_Guarantee_of_Even_Representation_of_Complete_Pareto_Frontier","241641119_Concept_selection_using_s-pareto_frontiers","239392249_Simulated_annealing_algorithm_for_multiobjective_optimization","238685473_Concept_Selection_Using_s-Pareto_Frontiers","229754557_Defectiveness_of_Weighting_Method_in_Multicriterion_Optimization_of_Structures","227255247_A_survey_of_multicriteria_optimization_or_the_vector_maximum_problem_Part_I_1776-1960","226918823_The_normalized_normal_constraint_method_for_generating_the_Pareto_frontier","225249665_Generating_Well-Distributed_Sets_of_Pareto_Points_for_Engineering_Design_Using_Physical_Programming","220045504_Multiple_Criteria_Optimisation_Theory_Computation_and_Application","3642928_Multi-objective_optimization_by_genetic_algorithms_A_review","3031049_Optimality_and_Non-Scalar-Valued_Performance_Criteria","3027780_Multiple-objective_problems_Pareto-optimal_solutions_by_method_of_proper_equality_constraints","2465269_An_Overview_of_Evolutionary_Algorithms_in_Multiobjective_Optimization"]}
