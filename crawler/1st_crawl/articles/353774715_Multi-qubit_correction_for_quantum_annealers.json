{"id":"353774715_Multi-qubit_correction_for_quantum_annealers","abstract":"We present multi-qubit correction (MQC) as a novel postprocessing method for quantum annealers that views the evolution in an open-system as a Gibbs sampler and reduces a set of excited states to a new synthetic state with lower energy value. After sampling from the ground state of a given (Ising) Hamiltonian, MQC compares pairs of excited states to recognize virtual tunnels—i.e., a group of qubits that changing their states simultaneously can result in a new state with lower energy value—and successively converges to the ground state. Experimental results using D-Wave 2000Q quantum annealers demonstrate that MQC finds samples with notably lower energy values and improves the reproducibility of results when compared to recent hardware/software advances in the realm of quantum annealing, such as spin-reversal transforms, classical postprocessing techniques, and increased inter-sample delay between successive measurements.","authors":["Ramin Ayanzadeh","John Dorband","Milton Halem","Tim Finin"],"meta":["August 2021Scientific Reports 11(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-021-95482-w"],"references":["353854194_Performance_of_Domain-Wall_Encoding_for_Quantum_Annealing","351422507_Pre-_and_post-processing_in_quantum-computational_hydrologic_inverse_analysis","341378623_Reinforcement_Quantum_Annealing_A_Hybrid_Quantum_Learning_Automata","338760212_Theory_versus_practice_in_annealing-based_quantum_computing","329102384_Quantum_fluctuation_theorem_for_error_diagnostics_in_quantum_annealers","337638000_Optimizing_the_Spin_Reversal_Transform_on_the_D-Wave_2000Q","337441268_On_Post-processing_the_Results_of_Quantum_Optimizers","336454047_Mitigating_Measurement_Errors_in_Quantum_Computers_by_Exploiting_State-Dependent_Bias","323570979_Nested_Quantum_Annealing_Correction_at_Finite_Temperature_p-spin_models","322781740_Adiabatic_quantum_computation"]}
