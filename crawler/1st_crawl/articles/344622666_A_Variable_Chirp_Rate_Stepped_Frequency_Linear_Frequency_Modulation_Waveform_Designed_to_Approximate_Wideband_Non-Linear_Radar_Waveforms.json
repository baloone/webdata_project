However, a high sampling frequency and consequently an expensive ADC are required. To overcome this drawback while taking advantage of the features of the NLFM waveform, we suggest approximating the wideband NLFM waveform by a piecewise linear waveform and using it in a stepped frequency (SF) framework. Thus, a variable chirp rate SF-LFM waveform is proposed where SF is combined with a train of LFM pulses having different chirp rates, durations, and bandwidths. In this paper, these parameters are derived from a tangent-based NLFM waveform. At the receiver, a generalized version of the time domain (TD) algorithm is proposed to process the received echoes. Our purpose is to obtain the high range resolution profile (HRRP) whose properties are of the same magnitude orders as those obtained using a tangent-based NLFM waveform. These properties are the peak sidelobe ratio, the integrated sidelobe, and the range resolution. Toward this goal, a multi-objective optimization issue is addressed to deduce the parameters of the proposed waveform by using two types of approaches based on evolutionary algorithms. Their relevance is compared. Our analysis and simulations show that the proposed approaches attain the targeted performance goals with a smaller sampling frequency at the receiver.","authors":["Mahdi Saleh","Samir-Mohamad Omar","Eric Grivel","Pierrick Legrand"],"meta":["November 2020Digital Signal Processing 109","DOI:10.1016/j.dsp.2020.102884"],"references":["316727263_Phase_Coded_Stepped_Frequency_Linear_Frequency_Modulated_Waveform_Synthesis_Technique_for_Low_Altitude_Ultra_Wideband_Synthetic_Aperture_Radar","304525642_Grating_lobe_and_Sidelobe_Suppression_using_Multi-Objective_Optimization_Techniques","299608413_Synthetic_Aperture_Radar_Imaging_Using_Nonlinear_Frequency_Modulation_Signal","346401072_Diversifying_the_Processing_Chain_of_the_Modified_Stepped_Frequency_Radar_Waveform_Combined_with_Pulse_Compression_Techniques","332164355_Nonlinear_Frequency_Modulation_Signal_Generator_in_LT-1","330894389_A_modified_stepped_frequency_phase_coding_radar_waveform_designed_for_the_frequency_domain_algorithm","323213335_Robust_Genetic_Algorithm_and_Fuzzy_Inference_Mechanism_Embedded_in_Sliding-Mode_Controller_for_Uncertain_Underwater_Robot","313288271_Imaging_approach_for_airborne_stepped-frequency_synthetic_aperture_radar_in_the_squinted_mode","308050198_Identifying_Smart_Design_Attributes_for_Industry_40_Customization_Using_a_Clustering_Genetic_Algorithm","282545523_A_Pulse_Compression_Waveform_for_Weather_Radars_With_Solid-State_Transmitters"]}
