{"id":"331301973_The_Role_of_Translanguaging_in_Computational_Literacies_Documenting_Middle_School_Bilinguals'_Practices_in_Computer_Science_Integrated_Units","abstract":"Bilingual education has described a process called translanguaging by which students use linguistic resources across and beyond multiple named languages to learn. Here, we examine how bilingual learners translanguage while learning computer science. These middle schoolers participated in a curricular intervention which infused computational thinking into their Spanish-English bilingual language arts class. Through a descriptive qualitative methodology, we document classroom moments supporting four claims: 1) students' translanguaging blurs linguistic, disciplinary, and modal boundaries, 2) computational literacies are intertwined with students' other literacies, 3) students' attitudes about language and the contexts around them play a role in their translanguaging, and 4) students translanguage to engage in specific CT practices.","authors":["Sara Vogel","Christopher Hoadley","Laura Ascenzi-Moreno","Kate Menken"],"meta":["February 2019","DOI:10.1145/3287324.3287368","Conference: the 50th ACM Technical Symposium"],"references":["325721957_Digital_Literacy_in_Higher_Education","323331432_Does_Native_Language_Play_a_Role_in_Learning_a_Programming_Language","316933590_Validating_the_Power_of_Bilingual_Schooling_Thirty-Two_Years_of_Large-Scale_Longitudinal_Research","305247830_Language_Bilingualism_and_Education","300484209_Classroom_Versus_Screencast_for_Native_Language_Learners","288607410_Pushing_past_the_achievement_gap_An_essay_on_the_language_of_deficit","287243813_Dismantling_Contemporary_Deficit_Thinking_Educational_Thought_and_Practice","285803085_Beliefs_in_Context_Understanding_Language_Policy_Implementation_at_a_Systems_Level","282739373_Clarifying_translanguaging_and_deconstructing_named_languages_A_perspective_from_linguistics","271938908_Principals_as_linchpins_in_bilingual_education_the_need_for_prepared_school_leaders"]}
