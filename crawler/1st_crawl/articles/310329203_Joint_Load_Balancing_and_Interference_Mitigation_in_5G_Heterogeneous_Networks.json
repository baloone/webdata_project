{"id":"310329203_Joint_Load_Balancing_and_Interference_Mitigation_in_5G_Heterogeneous_Networks","abstract":"We study the problem of joint load balancing and interference mitigation in heterogeneous networks (HetNets) in which massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) macro cell base station (BS) equipped with a large number of antennas, overlaid with wireless self-backhauled small cells (SCs) are assumed. Self-backhauled SC BSs with full-duplex communication employing regular antenna arrays serve both macro users and SC users by using the wireless backhaul from macro BS in the same frequency band. We formulate the joint load balancing and interference mitigation problem as a network utility maximization subject to wireless backhaul constraints. Subsequently, leveraging the framework of stochastic optimization, the problem is decoupled into dynamic scheduling of macro cell users, backhaul provisioning of SCs, and offloading macro cell users to SCs as a function of interference and backhaul links. Via numerical results, we show the performance gains of our proposed framework under the impact of small cells density, number of base station antennas, and transmit power levels at low and high frequency bands. We further provide insights into the performance analysis and convergence of the proposed framework. The numerical results show that the proposed user association algorithm outperforms other baselines. Interestingly, we find that even at lower frequency band the performance of open access small cell is close to that of closed access at some operating points, the open access full- duplex small cell still yields higher gain as compared to the closed access at higher frequency bands. With increasing the small cell density or the wireless backhaul quality, the open access full- duplex small cells outperform and achieve a 5.6x gain in terms of cell-edge performance as compared to the closed access ones in ultra-dense networks with 350 small cell base stations per km2 .","authors":["Kien Vu","Mehdi Bennis","Sumudu Samarakoon","m√©rouane Debbah"],"meta":["June 2017IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications 16(9):6032-6046","Project: 5Gto10G"],"references":["322976240_Path_Selection_and_Rate_Allocation_in_Self-Backhauled_mmWave_Networks","322969151_Ultra-Reliable_Communication_in_5G_mmWave_Networks_A_Risk-Sensitive_Approach","322675070_Toward_Low-Latency_and_Ultra-Reliable_Virtual_Reality","322306075_Ultra-Reliable_and_Low-Latency_Wireless_Communication_Tail_Risk_and_Scale","321241942_Traffic_Allocation_for_Low-Latency_Multi-Hop_Millimeter-Wave_Networks_with_Buffers","320564497_Correction_Factor_for_Analysis_of_MIMO_Wireless_Networks_With_Highly_Directional_Beamforming","319328021_Wireless_Access_for_Ultra-Reliable_Low-Latency_Communication_Principles_and_Building_Blocks","318767026_Full_duplex_techniques_for_5G_networks_self-interference_cancellation_protocol_design_and_relay_selection","329575367_Energy-Efficient_Interactive_Beam-Alignment_for_Millimeter-Wave_Networks","318202529_Distributed_Solutions_for_Energy_Efficiency_Fairness_in_Multicell_MISO_Downlink","317559510_Millimeter-Wave_Multi-Hop_Wireless_Backhauling_for_5G_Cellular_Networks","317187601_Capacity_Scaling_of_Cellular_Networks_Impact_of_Bandwidth_Infrastructure_Density_and_Number_of_Antennas","317032004_Ultra-Reliable_and_Low_Latency_Communication_in_mmWave-Enabled_Massive_MIMO_Networks","318036409_Hybrid-beamforming-based_millimeter-wave_cellular_network_optimization","315904664_Gbps_User_Rates_Using_mmWave_Relayed_Backhaul_With_High-Gain_Antennas"]}
