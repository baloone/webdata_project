{"id":"266089392_Adaptive_Control_of_a_Quadrotor_with_Dynamic_Changes_in_the_Center_of_Gravity","abstract":"In this paper, we address the problem of quadrotor stabilization and trajectory tracking with dynamic changes in the quadrotor's center of gravity. This problem has great practical significance in many UAV applications. However, it has received little attention in literature so far. In this paper, we present an adaptive tracking controller based on output feedback linearization that compensates for dynamical changes in the center of gravity of the quadrotor. Effectiveness and robustness of the proposed adaptive control scheme is verified through simulation results. The proposed controller is an important step towards developing the next generation of agile autonomous aerial vehicles. This control algorithm enables a quadrotor to display agile maneuvers while reconfiguring in real time whenever a change in the center of gravity occurs.","authors":["Ivana Palunko","Rafael Fierro"],"meta":["August 2011IFAC Proceedings Volumes (IFAC Papers-OnLine) 18(1)","DOI:10.3182/20110828-6-IT-1002.02564"],"references":["230872857_Flatness_and_defect_of_non-linear_systems_introductory_theory_and_examples","224685486_Distributed_Control_of_the_Center_of_Mass_of_a_Modular_Robot","224557340_Aerodynamics_and_control_of_autonomous_quadrotor_helicopters_in_aggressive_maneuvering","224296442_On-line_rigid_object_recognition_and_pose_estimation_based_on_inertial_parameters","220122225_AMOUR_V_A_Hovering_Energy_Efficient_Underwater_Robot_Capable_of_Dynamic_Payloads","4076717_Design_and_Control_of_an_Indoor_Micro_Quadrotor","310830377_Cooperative_manipulation_and_transportation_with_aerial_robots","309629827_Applied_Nonlinear_Control","288960352_Real-time_indoor_autonomous_vehicle_test_environment","260082496_Nonlinear_Systems","238956914_Mathematical_Methods_for_Physicists","235057542_Nonlinear_Control_Systems","229086690_Essential_Mathematical_Methods_For_Physicists","224648912_Lagrangian_Formulation_of_Underwater_Vehicles'_Dynamics","224318511_Planning_in_information_space_for_a_quadrotor_helicopter_in_a_GPS-denied_environment","220474158_Towards_autonomous_indoor_micro_VTOL","3207972_Real-time_indoor_autonomous_vehicle_test_environment_IEEE_Control_Syst_Mag_282_51-64","3207657_Stabilization_of_a_mini_rotorcraft_with_four_rotors"]}
