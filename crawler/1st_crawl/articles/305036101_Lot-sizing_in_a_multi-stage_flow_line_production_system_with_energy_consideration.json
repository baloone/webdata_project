{"id":"305036101_Lot-sizing_in_a_multi-stage_flow_line_production_system_with_energy_consideration","abstract":"In this paper, a single-item capacitated lot-sizing problem in a flow-shop system with energy consideration is studied. The planning horizon is defined by a set of periods where each one is characterised by a length, an allowed maximal power, an electricity price, a power price and a demand. The objective is to determine the quantities to be produced by each machine at each period while minimising the production cost in terms of electrical, inventory, set-up and power required costs. For medium- and large-scale problems, lot-sizing problems are hard to solve. Therefore, in this study, two heuristics are developed to solve this problem in a reasonable time. To evaluate the performances of these heuristics, computational experiments are presented and numerical results are discussed and analysed.","authors":["Oussama Masmoudi","Alice Yalaoui","Yassine Ouazene","Hicham Chehade"],"meta":["July 2016International Journal of Production Research","DOI:10.1080/00207543.2016.1206670"],"references":["281548786_Lot-sizing_in_flow-shop_with_energy_consideration_for_sustainable_manufacturing_systems","280318574_Green_manufacturing_supply_chain_design_and_operations_decision_support","263057681_Integration_of_Lot_Sizing_and_Flow_Shop_Scheduling_with_Lot_Streaming","262426076_Integrated_low-carbon_distribution_system_for_the_demand_side_of_a_product_distribution_supply_chain_A_DoE-guided_MOPSO_optimiser-based_solution_approach","264231917_An_empirical_examination_of_stakeholder_pressures_green_operations_practices_and_environmental_performance","263894157_Time-of-use_based_electricity_cost_of_manufacturing_systems_Modeling_and_monotonicity_analysis","263058184_A_genetic_algorithm_for_the_simultaneous_lot_sizing_and_scheduling_problem_in_capacitated_flow_shop_with_complex_setups_and_backlogging","261165376_A_dynamic_lot_sizing_model_with_carbon_emission_constraint_and_multi-mode_production_A_general_property_and_a_polynomially_solvable_case","259127417_Time-of-use_based_electricity_demand_response_for_sustainable_manufacturing_systems","257119053_MIP_formulation_and_heuristics_for_multi-stage_capacitated_lot-sizing_and_scheduling_problem_with_availability_constraints"]}
