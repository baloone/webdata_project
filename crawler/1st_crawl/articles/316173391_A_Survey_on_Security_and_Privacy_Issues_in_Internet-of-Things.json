{"id":"316173391_A_Survey_on_Security_and_Privacy_Issues_in_Internet-of-Things","abstract":"Internet of Things (IoT) are everywhere in our daily life. They are used in our homes, in hospitals, deployed outside to control and report the changes in environment, prevent fires, and many more beneficial functionality. However, all those benefits can come of huge risks of privacy loss and security issues. To secure the IoT devices, many research works have been conducted to countermeasure those problems and find a better way to eliminate those risks, or at least minimize their effects on the user's privacy and security requirements. The survey consists of four segments. The first segment will explore the most relevant limitations of IoT devices and their solutions. The second one will present the classification of IoT attacks. The next segment will focus on the mechanisms and architectures for authentication and access control. The last segment will analyze the security issues in different layers.","authors":["Yuchen Yang","Longfei Wu","Guisheng Yin","Lijie Li"],"meta":["April 2017IEEE Internet of Things Journal PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/JIOT.2017.2694844"],"references":["311488711_On_the_Feasibility_of_Cryptography_for_a_Wireless_Insulin_Pump_System","306301807_Identity-based_authentication_scheme_for_the_Internet_of_Things","304408245_Internet_of_Things_Security_vulnerabilities_and_challenges","304407957_A_DTLS-based_security_architecture_for_the_Internet_of_Things","345773344_Lightweight_Encryption_for_Smart_Home","314669346_An_Approach_to_Secure_Internet_of_Things_Against_DDoS","308189693_Adaptive_Latency-Aware_Query_Processing_on_Encrypted_Data_for_the_Internet_of_Things","306063757_SmartOrBAC_security_and_privacy_in_the_Internet_of_Things","305908247_On_the_authentication_of_devices_in_the_Internet_of_things","305287487_An_efficient_scheme_for_anonymous_communication_in_IoT"]}
