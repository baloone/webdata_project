{"id":"343679551_BREIZHCROPS_A_TIME_SERIES_DATASET_FOR_CROP_TYPE_MAPPING","abstract":"We present BreizhCrops, a novel benchmark dataset for the supervised classification of field crops from satellite time series. We aggregated label data and Sentinel-2 top-of-atmosphere as well as bottom-of-atmosphere time series in the region of Brittany (Breizh in local language), north-east France. We compare seven recently proposed deep neural networks along with a Random Forest baseline. The dataset, model (re-)implementations and pre-trained model weights are available at the associated GitHub repository (https://github.com/dl4sits/breizhcrops) that has been designed with applicability for practitioners in mind. We plan to maintain the repository with additional data and welcome contributions of novel methods to build a state-of-the-art benchmark on methods for crop type mapping.","authors":["Marc Rußwurm","Charlotte Pelletier","M.
