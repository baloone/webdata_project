{"id":"221136002_The_Munich_Reference_Model_for_Adaptive_Hypermedia_Applications","abstract":"Although adaptive applications are increasing in popularity, there are only a few approaches that focus on their generalization or the specification of a reference model. Trying to fill this gap, this paper presents a reference model for adaptive hypermedia applications, similar to AHAM. The main novelty of our approach is an object-oriented specification written in UML (Unified Modeling Language) which integrates both an intuitive visual representation and a formal unambiguous specification in OCL (Object Constraint Language). Our reference model is defined as an extension of the Dexter Hypertext Reference Model including user modeling aspects and rule-based adaptation mechanisms.","authors":["Nora Koch","Martin Wirsing"],"meta":["May 2002","DOI:10.1007/3-540-47952-X_23","SourceDBLP","Conference: Adaptive Hypermedia and Adaptive Web-Based Systems, Second International Conference, AH 2002, Malaga, Spain, May 29-31, 2002, Proceedings"],"references":["259180054_The_Dexter_Hypertext_Reference_Model","228609950_An_Object-Oriented_Hypermedia_Reference_Model_Formally_Specified_in_UML","228608564_SmexWeb_An_Adaptive_Web-Based_Hypermedia_Teaching_System","228595547_A_Practical_Architecture_for_User_Modeling_in_a_Hypermedia-Based_Information_System1","221267077_AHAM_A_Dexter-Based_Reference_Model_for_Adaptive_Hypermedia","221016117_Adaptive_Hypermedia_An_Attempt_to_Analyze_and_Generalize","247841064_The_Dortmund_Family_of_Hypermedia_Systems","244502080_Software_Engineering_for_Adaptive_Hypermedia_Systems_Reference_Model","239399045_An_Object-Oriented_Hypermedia_Reference_Model","229124977_OMG_Unified_Modeling_Language_Version_13"]}
