{"id":"313814915_Improving_Spatial_Perception_of_Vascular_Models_using_Supporting_Anchors_and_Illustrative_Visualization","abstract":"Incorrect spatial interpretation of 3D vascular models is a main perceptional problem in medical visualization. For improved depth perception, we propose supporting anchors between vascular trees and a cylindrical cutaway that serves as an insight for a virtual resection surface or a path for a tumor ablation. The supporting anchors are optimally arranged in a circular manner such that the depth can be perceived without time-consuming interaction. For improved shape perception and distance-encoding, we additionally employ a novel and fast hatching approach that produces results comparable to state-of-the-art techniques. The advantages of our new visualization approach are demonstrated using the example of laparoscopic liver surgery and confirmed in a quantitative user study with 81 participants. The results show that participants were able to assess relative distances more precisely and were most confident using our illustrative visualization approach.","authors":["Kai Lawonn","Maria Luz","Christian Hansen"],"meta":["February 2017Computers & Graphics 63","DOI:10.1016/j.cag.2017.02.002","Projects: Illustrative Visualization in MedicineLiver Surgery Training, Planning and NavigationForschungscampus STIMULATE - Solution Centre for Image Guided Local Therapies"],"references":["279529151_Illustrative_Visualization_of_Vascular_Models_for_Static_2D_Representations","276146634_A_gesture-controlled_projection_display_for_CT-guided_interventions","270905870_Feature_Lines_for_Illustrating_Medical_Surface_Models_Mathematical_Background_and_Survey","268504244_A_Comparative_User_Study_of_a_2D_and_an_Autostereoscopic_3D_Display_for_a_Tympanoplastic_Surgery","262162643_In_situ_spatial_AR_surgical_planning_using_projector-Kinect_system","259769662_An_Evaluation_of_Depth_Enhancing_Perceptual_Cues_for_Vascular_Volume_Visualization_in_Neurosurgery","257754411_Impact_of_model-based_risk_analysis_for_liver_surgery_planning","234795791_Toolglass_and_Magic_Lenses_The_see-through_interface","233791033_Auditory_support_for_resection_guidance_in_navigated_liver_surgery","232620698_Distance_Perception_in_Immersive_Virtual_Environments_Revisited","232231383_Risk_maps_for_liver_surgery","228326907_Intelligent_Cutaway_Illustrations","224197741_Perceptual_issues_in_augmented_reality_revisited","221515027_Toolglass_and_magic_lenses_the_see-through_interface","221283158_Distance_perception_in_NPR_immersive_virtual_environments_revisited","221054141_Employing_Dynamic_Transparency_for_3D_Occlusion_Management_Design_Issues_and_Evaluation","220901735_Using_Time-of-Flight_Range_Data_for_Occlusion_Handling_in_Augmented_Reality","220778387_Combining_Silhouettes_Surface_and_Volume_Rendering_for_Surgery_Education_and_Planning","47544606_IRIS_Illustrative_Rendering_for_Integral_Surfaces","45152863_Advanced_Segmentation_Techniques_for_Lung_Nodules_Liver_Metastases_and_Enlarged_Lymph_Nodes_in_CT_Scans","40768992_Illustrative_visualization_of_3D_planning_models_for_augmented_reality_in_liver_surgery","29604122_Interactive_Generation_and_Modification_of_Cutaway_Illustrations_for_Polygonal_Models","11000143_A_head-mounted_operating_binocular_for_augmented_reality_visualization_in_medicine_-_Design_and_initial_evaluation","6715578_Real-Time_Illustration_of_Vascular_Structures","309050537_Discrete_differential-geometry_operators_for_triangulated_2-manifolds","302937305_A_Threshold_Selection_Method_from_Gray-Level_Histogram","276064317_An_effective_visualization_technique_for_depth_perception_in_augmented_reality-based_surgical_navigation_An_effective_visualization_technique_for_depth_perception","261922573_A_system_for_context-aware_intraoperative_augmented_reality_in_dental_implant_surgery","257608430_Efficient_and_robust_3D_line_drawings_using_difference-of-Gaussian","257235201_Laser_projection_augmented_reality_system_for_computer-assisted_surgery","256846779_Streamlines_for_Illustrative_Real-Time_Rendering","242373779_Illumination_for_Computer_Generated_Pictures","227700436_Interactive_Cutaway_Illustrations","224399720_Improving_Spatial_Perception_for_Augmented_Reality_X-Ray_Vision","221272585_Improving_Depth_Perception_in_Medical_AR","220818842_KH_Visually_Supporting_Depth_Perception_in_Angiography_Imaging","220720263_Real-Time_Hatching","220566418_Efficient_Algorithms_for_Finding_Maximum_Matching_in_Graphs","220507723_High_Quality_Hatching","220183948_Suggestive_Contours_for_Conveying_Shape","220183668_Interactive_cutaway_illustrations_of_complex_3D_models","216813564_Adaptive_Cutaways_for_Comprehensible_Rendering_of_Polygonal_Scenes","51751964_Distance_Visualization_for_Interactive_3D_Implant_Planning","46381432_Real-Time_Shape_Illustration_Using_Laplacian_Lines","26713843_A_3-D_Mixed-Reality_System_for_Stereoscopic_Visualization_of_Medical_Dataset","24248156_The_Virtual_Mirror_A_New_Interaction_Paradigm_for_Augmented_Reality_Environments","23791828_Comprehensible_Visualization_for_Augmented_Reality","7913706_Visualization_of_vasculature_with_convolution_surfaces_Method_validation_and_evaluation","7336501_An_Augmented_Reality_System_for_MR_Image-guided_Needle_Biopsy_Initial_Results_in_a_Swine_Model_1","6452098_Depth_Perception_-_A_Major_Issue_in_Medical_AR_Evaluation_Study_by_Twenty_Surgeons","5878346_An_Effective_Illustrative_Visualization_Framework_Based_on_Photic_Extremum_Lines_PELs","5802451_pq-space_Based_Non-Photorealistic_Rendering_for_Augmented_Reality","4334426_Interactive_Focus_and_Context_Visualization_for_Augmented_Reality","4334412_Contextual_Anatomic_Mimesis_Hybrid_In-Situ_Visualization_Method_for_Improving_Multi-Sensory_Depth_Perception_in_Medical_Augmented_Reality","4180946_Real-time_predefined_shape_cutaway_with_parametric_boundaries"]}
