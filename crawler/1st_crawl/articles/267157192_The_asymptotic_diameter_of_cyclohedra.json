{"id":"267157192_The_asymptotic_diameter_of_cyclohedra","abstract":"It is shown here that the diameter of the $d$-dimensional cyclohedron is not\ngreater than $\\lceil 5d/2\\rceil-2$. It is also shown that the $5/2$ coefficient\nin this upper bound is asymptotically sharp. More precisely, the\n$d$-dimensional cyclohedron has diameter at least $5d/2-4\\sqrt{d}-4$.","authors":["Lionel Pournin"],"meta":["October 2014Israel Journal of Mathematics 219(2)","DOI:10.1007/s11856-017-1492-0","SourcearXiv"],"references":["221591323_Rotation_Distance_Triangulations_and_Hyperbolic_Geometry","303491640_Rotation_distance_triangulations_and_hyperbolic_geometry","266986624_Triangulations_Structures_for_algorithms_and_applications","262805478_The_diameter_of_type_D_associahedra_and_the_non-leaving-face_property","237542091_Triangulations_Of_Point_Sets_Applications_Structures_Algorithms","234917681_On_the_self-linking_of_knots","230568956_The_diameter_of_associahedra","222990184_A_type-B_associahedron","222833051_A_Realization_of_Graph-Associahedra","222697515_Coxeter_Complexes_and_Graph-Associahedra","2296957_Triangulations_of_Cyclic_Polytopes_and_Higher_Bruhat_Orders","2219358_Simplex_associahedron_and_cyclohedron","2101308_Polytopal_Realizations_of_Generalized_Associahedra","2051703_Y-systems_and_generalized_associahedra"]}
