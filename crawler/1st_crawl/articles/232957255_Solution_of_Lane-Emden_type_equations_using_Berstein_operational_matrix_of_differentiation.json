{"id":"232957255_Solution_of_Lane-Emden_type_equations_using_Berstein_operational_matrix_of_differentiation","abstract":"The purpose of this paper is to propose an efficient numerical method for solving Lane–Emden type equations arising in astrophysics using Bernstein polynomials. First Bernstein operational matrix of differentiation is derived using Bernstein polynomials and then applied to solve the linear and nonlinear differential equations of Lane–Emden type. Some illustrative examples are given to demonstrate the efficiency and validity of the proposed algorithm.","authors":["Rajesh K.
