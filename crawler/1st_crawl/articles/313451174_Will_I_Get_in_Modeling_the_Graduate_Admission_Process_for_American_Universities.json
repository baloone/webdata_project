{"id":"313451174_Will_I_Get_in_Modeling_the_Graduate_Admission_Process_for_American_Universities","abstract":"We study the graduate admission process in Amer-\nican universities from studentsâ€™ perspective. Our goal is to\nbuild a decision support model that provides candidates with\npertinent information as well as the ability to assess their choices\nduring the application process. This model is driven by extensive\nmachine learning based analysis of large amounts of historic\ndata available on the web. Our analysis considers factors such\nas standardized test scores and GPA as well as world knowledge\nsuch as university reputation. The learning problem is modeled as\na binary classification problem with latent variables that account\nfor hidden information, such as multiple graduate programs\nwithin the same institution.\nAn additional contribution of this paper is the collection of a\nnew dataset of more than 25,000 students, with 6 applications per\nstudent on average and, hence, amounting to more than 150,000\napplications spanning across more than 3000 source institutions.\nThe dataset covers hundreds of target universities over several\nyears, and allows us to develop models that provide insight into\nstudent application behavior and university decision patterns.\nOur experimental study reveals some key factors in the decision\nprocess of programs that provide applicants the ability to make\nan informed decision during application, with high confidence of\nbeing accepted.","authors":["Narender Gupta","Aman Sawhney","Dan Roth"],"meta":["December 2016","DOI:10.1109/ICDMW.2016.0095","Conference: 2016 IEEE 16th International Conference on Data Mining Workshops (ICDMW)"],"references":["327606791_Classification_And_Regression_Trees","310606656_Classification_and_regression_trees","307881957_LIBSVM_A_library_for_support_vector_machines","288906520_Random_forests","288177281_Mining_Frequent_Patterns_Associations_and_Correlations","283667552_GRADE_Machine_Learning_Support_for_Graduate_Admissions","235961479_Classification_and_Regression_Trees","226887520_Statistical_models_for_college_admission_and_enrollment_A_case_study_for_a_selective_liberal_arts_college","226222944_Induction_of_Decision_Trees","226107195_Linear_Concepts_and_Hidden_Variables"]}
