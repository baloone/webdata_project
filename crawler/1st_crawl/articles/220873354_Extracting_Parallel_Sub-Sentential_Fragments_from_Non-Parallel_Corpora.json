{"id":"220873354_Extracting_Parallel_Sub-Sentential_Fragments_from_Non-Parallel_Corpora","abstract":"We present a novel method for extract- ing parallel sub-sentential fragments from comparable, non-parallel bilingual cor- pora. By analyzing potentially similar sentence pairs using a signal processing- inspired approach, we detect which seg- ments of the source sentence are translated into segments in the target sentence, and which are not. This method enables us to extract useful machine translation train- ing data even from very non-parallel cor- pora, which contain no parallel sentence pairs. We evaluate the quality of the ex- tracted data by showing that it improves the performance of a state-of-the-art sta- tistical machine translation system.","authors":["Dragos Stefan Munteanu","Daniel Marcu"],"meta":["January 2006","DOI:10.3115/1220175.1220186","SourceDBLP","Conference: ACL 2006, 21st International Conference on Computational Linguistics and 44th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, Proceedings of the Conference, Sydney, Australia, 17-21 July 2006"],"references":["230875890_The_Mathematics_of_Statistical_Machine_Translation_Parameter_Estimation","221606312_Estimating_Word_Translation_Probabilities_from_Unrelated_Monolingual_Corpora_Using_the_EM_Algorithm","221013020_Statistical_Significance_Tests_for_Machine_Translation_Evaluation","220873085_A_Geometric_View_on_Bilingual_Lexicon_Extraction_from_Comparable_Corpora","220355462_The_Alignment_Template_Approach_to_Statistical_Machine_Translation","4006000_Adaptive_parallel_sentences_mining_from_web_bilingual_news_collection","2876877_A_Systematic_Comparison_of_Various_Statistical_Alignment_Models","2588204_BLEU_a_Method_for_Automatic_Evaluation_of_Machine_Translation","2477641_Accurate_Methods_for_the_Statistics_of_Surprise_and_Coincidence","2472790_Using_Noisy_Bilingual_Data_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation","262250180_Improved_cross-language_retrieval_using_backoff_translation","234832484_Automatic_identification_of_word_translations_from_unrelated_English_and_German_corpora","228871441_Mining_new_word_translations_from_comparable_corpora","228779927_Multi-level_bootstrapping_for_extracting_parallel_sentences_from_a_quasi-comparable_corpus","228768648_Sentence_alignment_in_parallel_comparable_and_quasi-comparable_corpora","221324337_Inversion_Transduction_Grammar_Constraints_for_Mining_Parallel_Sentences_from_Quasi-Comparable_Corpora","221013100_Mining_Very-Non-Parallel_Corpora_Parallel_Sentence_and_Lexicon_Extraction_via_Bootstrapping_and_E","221012917_On_Log-Likelihood-Ratios_and_the_Significance_of_Rare_Events","220874444_Reliable_Measures_for_Aligning_Japanese-English_News_Articles_and_Sentences","220874001_Improving_IBM_Word_Alignment_Model_1","220355364_Improving_Machine_Translation_Performance_by_Exploiting_Non-Parallel_Corpora","2921501_Named_Entity_Discovery_Using_Comparable_News_Articles","2849952_Experiments_Using_the_Lemur_Toolkit","2572314_An_IR_Approach_for_Translating_New_Words_from_Nonparallel_Comparable_Texts","2539014_Models_of_Translational_Equivalence_among_Words","2533327_The_Web_as_a_Parallel_Corpus","2322010_A_Statistical_Word-Level_Translation_Model_for_Comparable_Corpora"]}
