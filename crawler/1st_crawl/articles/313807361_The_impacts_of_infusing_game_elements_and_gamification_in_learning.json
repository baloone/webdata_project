With games based learning methods such as digital game based learning, serious games and more recently gamification. Yet, with the increasing tasks of teachers nowadays, the use of gamification; game elements in non-gaming context, has been gaining momentum. Although there has been research that has shown the effects of gamification on learning, the fundamental of game elements on learning via traditional and online method has been less ventured into. Thus, a mixed method research was carried out using a gamification platform as a mediator for students learning Science. The eight week gamified online intervention was carried out in tandem with the traditional classroom. The game elements used were points and badges whilst leaderboard was reflected on the amount of points and badges. The findings based on the interviews with the participants found all the elements plays a part in engaging the interest of students in learning, more so badges and leaderboard. It was also identified that certain elements are preferred to acquire either online or offline.","authors":["Mageswaran A/L Sanmugam","Norasykin Mohd Zaid","Zaleha binti Abdullah","Baharuddin Aris"],"meta":["December 2016","DOI:10.1109/ICEED.2016.7856058","Conference: 2016 IEEE 8th International Conference on Engineering Education (ICEED)"],"references":["312457140_Disassembling_gamification_The_effects_of_points_and_meaning_on_user_motivation_and_performance","280387235_Gamification_and_Serious_Games_-The_enigma_and_the_use_in_Education","280387148_Gamification_as_an_Educational_Technology_Tool_in_Engaging_and_Motivating_Students_An_Analyses_Review","277576675_Perceived_and_Actual_Role_of_Gamification_Principles","273704751_Do_badges_increase_user_activity_A_field_experiment_on_effects_of_gamification","261052786_Gamification_of_a_Software_Engineering_course_and_a_detailed_analysis_of_the_factors_that_lead_to_it's_failure","259167089_Serious_games_for_health","258839995_Digital_badges_in_education","228770110_Affect_and_learning_An_exploratory_look_into_the_role_of_affect_in_learning_with_AutoTutor","228352956_The_Effects_Of_The_Computer-Based_Instruction_On_The_Achievement_And_Problem_Solving_Skills_Of_The_Science_And_Technology_Students","227278257_Entrapment_and_Near_Miss_A_Comparative_Analysis_of_Psycho-Structural_Elements_in_Gambling_Games_and_Massively_Multiplayer_Online_Role-Playing_Games","220879008_Removing_gamification_from_an_enterprise_SNS","220686314_What_Video_Games_Have_to_Teach_Us_About_Learning_and_Literacy","201381833_Games_Motivation_and_Learning_A_Research_and_Practice_Model","278820627_Learning_to_play_games_or_playing_games_to_learn_A_health_education_case_study_with_Soweto_teenagers","271787795_Digital_Game-Based_Learning","270823073_Gamification_in_assessment_Do_points_affect_test_performance","269308440_Perceived_and_Actual_Role_of_Gamification_Principles","262841944_Leaderboards_in_a_virtual_classroom_A_test_of_stereotype_threat_and_social_comparison_explanations_for_women's_math_performance","261996033_Empirical_Study_on_the_Effect_of_Achievement_Badges_in_TRAKLA2_Online_Learning_Environment","246285983_Games_and_simulations_and_their_relationships_to_learning","238374519_What_Video_Games_Have_to_Teach_Us_About_Learning_and_Literacy","234812017_Serious_Games_Games_That_Educate_Train_and_Inform","230854744_A_User-Centered_Theoretical_Framework_for_Meaningful_Gamification","228665755_Current_trends_in_educational_technology_research","228349513_Students'_conflicting_attitudes_towards_games_as_a_vehicle_for_learning_mathematics_A_methodological_dilemma","220374917_A_Systems_Definition_of_Educational_Technology_in_Society","220140234_The_effects_of_computer_games_on_primary_school_students'_achievement_and_motivation_in_geography_learning"]}
