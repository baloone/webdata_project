{"id":"327158563_The_Proposal_of_a_Evolutionary_Strategy_Generating_the_Data_Structures_Based_on_a_Horizontal_Tree_for_the_Tests","abstract":"The aim of the article is to present a mathematical definition of the object model, that is known in computer science as TreeList and to show application of this model for design evolutionary algorithm, that purpose is to generate structures based on this object. The first chapter introduces the reader to the problem of presenting data using the TreeList object. The second chapter describes the problem of testing data structures based on TreeList. The third one shows a mathematical model of the object TreeList and the parameters, used in determining the utility of structures created through this model and in evolutionary strategy, that generates these structures for testing purposes. The last chapter provides a brief summary and plans for future research related to the algorithm presented in the article.","authors":["Marek Żukowicz","Michał Markiewicz"],"meta":["September 2016Management Systems in Production Engineering 23(3):145-149","DOI:10.2478/mspe-01-03-2016"],"references":[]}
