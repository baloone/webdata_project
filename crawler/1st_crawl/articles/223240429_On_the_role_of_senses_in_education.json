{"id":"223240429_On_the_role_of_senses_in_education","abstract":"The efficiency of teaching algorithms can be highly improved by utilizing the senses as educational aids. The authors have developed a new didactical method and a software tool which exemplifies, for the case of simple algorithms, how the involvement of eyesight, hearing and the kinaesthesia can help in the teaching and learning process. This paper also gives a detailed description of a didactical experiment which proves empirically the efficiency of this new approach.","authors":["Zoltan Katai","Katalin Juh치sz","Alp치r K치roly Adorj치ni"],"meta":["December 2008Computers & Education 51(4):1707-1717","DOI:10.1016/j.compedu.2008.05.002","SourceDBLP"],"references":["261644200_Cognitive_Load_Theory_and_Instructional_Design_Recent_Developments","234800767_A_Multi-National_Study_of_Reading_and_Tracing_Skills_in_Novice_Programmers","228787968_Closed_Loop_Dialog_Model_of_Face-to-Face_Communication_with_a_Photo-Real_Virtual_Human","221537758_Design_early_considered_harmful_Graduated_exposure_to_complexity_and_structure_based_on_levels_of_cognitive_development","220613379_A_multi-national_multi-institutional_study_of_assessment_of_programming_skills_of_first-year_CS_students","220612781_A_cognitive_approach_to_identifying_measurable_milestones_for_programming_skill_acquisition","220420651_Cognitive_Strategies_and_Looping_Constructs_An_Empirical_Study","37145416_Can_Graduating_Students_Design_Software_Systems","5665300_Multisensory_Interplay_Reveals_Crossmodal_Influences_on_'Sensory-Specific'_Brain_Regions_Neural_Responses_and_Judgments","314828921_A_multi-national_multi-institutional_study_of_assessment_of_programming_skills_of_first-year_CS_students","287496357_Supporting_current_pedagogical_approaches_with_neuroscience_research","270150441_The_Language_Continuum_From_Infancy_to_Literacy","262187569_How_to_Solve_it","257925990_How_People_Learn_Mind_Brain_Experience_and_School","249612111_Improving_student_programming_skills_by_developing_program_comprehension_abilities_panel_discussion","234827817_Pattern_oriented_instruction_and_the_enhancement_of_analogical_reasoning","234814198_Programming_pedagogy-A_psychological_overview","234782675_Hierarchies_of_programming_concepts_Abstraction_generality_and_beyond","231167898_Some_Difficulties_of_Learning_to_Program","228601241_Multisensory_Immersion_as_a_Modeling_Environment_for_Learning_Complex_Scientific_Concepts","220420384_Novice_Mistakes_Are_the_Folk_Wisdoms_Correct","200110545_How_to_Solve_It","31761803_Overcoming_Dyslexia_A_New_and_Complete_Science-Based_Program_for_Reading_Problems_at_Any_Level_S_Shaywitz","3735421_Virtual_Reality_In_Education_Promise_And_Reality"]}
