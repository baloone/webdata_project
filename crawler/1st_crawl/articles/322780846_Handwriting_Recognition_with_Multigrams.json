{"id":"322780846_Handwriting_Recognition_with_Multigrams","abstract":"We introduce a novel handwriting recognition ap-\nproach based on sub-lexical units known as multigrams of\ncharacters, that are variable lengths characters sequences. A\nHidden Semi Markov model is used to model the multigrams\noccurrences within the target language corpus. Decoding the\ntraining language corpus with this model provides an optimized\nmultigram lexicon of reduced size with high coverage rate of\nOOV compared to the traditional word modeling approach. The\nhandwriting recognition system is composed of two components:\nthe optical model and the statistical n-grams of multigrams\nlanguage model. The two models are combined together during\nthe recognition process using a decoding technique based on\nWeighted Finite State Transducers (WFST). We experiment the\napproach on two Latin language datasets (the French RIMES\nand English IAM datasets) and we show that it outperforms\nwords and character models language models for high Out Of\nVocabulary (OOV) words rates, and that it performs similarly to\nthese traditional models for low OOV rates, with the advantage\nof a reduced complexity.","authors":["Wassim Swaileh","Thierry Paquet","Yann Soullard","Pierrick Tranouez"],"meta":["November 2017","DOI:10.1109/ICDAR.2017.31","Conference: 2017 14th IAPR International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR)","Project: PIVAJ : Plateforme d'Indexation et de Visualisation d'Articles de Journaux"],"references":["261199343_Open_Vocabulary_Arabic_Handwriting_Recognition_Using_Morphological_Decomposition","259334958_Dropout_Improves_Recurrent_Neural_Networks_for_Handwriting_Recognition","234758866_Morph-based_speech_recognition_and_modeling_of_out-of-vocabulary_words_across_languages","232621733_Design_of_a_speech_recognition_system_based_on_acoustically_derived_segmental_units","312485418_Handwriting_Recognition_with_Large_Multidimensional_Long_Short-Term_Memory_Recurrent_Neural_Networks","290182483_Deep_Neural_Networks_for_Large_Vocabulary_Handwritten_Text_Recognition","280589906_EESEN_End-to-end_speech_recognition_using_deep_RNN_models_and_WFST-based_decoding","279822743_Language_Modeling_for_limited-data_domains","247625996_Spoken_Language_Processing_A_Guide_to_Theory_Algorithm_and_System_Development","240156067_Online_and_o_ine_handwriting_recognition_A_comprehensive_survey_PAMI"]}
