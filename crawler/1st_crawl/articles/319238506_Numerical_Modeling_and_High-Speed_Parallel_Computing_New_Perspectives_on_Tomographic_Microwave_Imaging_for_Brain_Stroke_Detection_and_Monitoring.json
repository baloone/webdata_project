{"id":"319238506_Numerical_Modeling_and_High-Speed_Parallel_Computing_New_Perspectives_on_Tomographic_Microwave_Imaging_for_Brain_Stroke_Detection_and_Monitoring","abstract":"This article deals with microwave tomography for brain stroke imaging using state-of-the-art numerical modeling and massively parallel computing. Iterative microwave tomographic imaging requires the solution of an inverse problem based on a minimization algorithm (e.g., gradient based) with successive solutions of a direct problem such as the accurate modeling of a whole-microwave measurement system. Moreover, a sufficiently high number of unknowns is required to accurately represent the solution. As the system will be used for detecting a brain stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) as well as for monitoring during the treatment, the running times for the reconstructions should be reasonable. The method used is based on high-order finite elements, parallel preconditioners from the domain decomposition method and domain-specific language with the open source FreeFEM++ solver.","authors":["Pierre-Henri Tournier","Marcella Bonazzoli","Victorita Dolean","Francesca Rapetti"],"meta":["August 2017IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/MAP.2017.2731199"],"references":["313775775_Parallel_preconditioners_for_high-order_discretizations_arising_from_full_system_modeling_for_brain_microwave_imaging","281216846_Neuroimaging_for_acute_ischemic_stroke_current_challenges","262534142_Real-time_Microwave_Imaging_of_Differential_Temperature_for_Thermal_Therapy_Monitoring","262153427_Scalable_Domain_Decomposition_Preconditioners_for_Heterogeneous_Elliptic_Problems","227155107_Optimized_Restricted_Additive_Schwarz_Methods","220179643_Whitney_Forms_of_Higher_Degree","2797268_A_Fast_And_High_Quality_Multilevel_Scheme_For_Partitioning_Irregular_Graphs","317748383_Numerical_Methods_for_Inverse_Problems","311380674_An_Introduction_to_Domain_Decomposition_Methods_algorithms_theory_and_parallel_implementation","285906939_Numerical_optimization","282681652_Electromagnetic_tomography_for_brain_imaging_From_virtual_to_human_brain","280534873_An_Introduction_to_Domain_Decomposition_Methods_algorithms_theory_and_parallel_implementation","266943439_New_development_in_FreeFem","263177207_Scalable_Domain_Decomposition_Preconditioners_for_Heterogeneous_Elliptic_Problems","262043407_An_Updated_Definition_of_Stroke_for_the_21st_Century_A_Statement_for_Healthcare_Professionals_From_the_American_Heart_AssociationAmerican_Stroke_Association","260720212_A_More_Scalable_and_Efficient_Parallelization_of_the_Adaptive_Integral_Method-Part_II_BIOEM_Application","242723020_High_order_edge_elements_on_simplicial_meshes","232992763_Optimized_Schwarz_Methods_for_Maxwell's_Equations","232988271_High_performance_domain_decomposition_methods_on_massively_parallel_architectures_with_FreeFEM","227082935_Mixed_Finite_Elements_in_R3","222569110_Solving_unsymmetric_sparse_systems_of_linear_equations_with_PARADISO","220285010_Solving_unsymmetric_sparse_systems_of_linear_equations_with_PARDISO","30417529_A_Fully_Asynchronous_Multifrontal_Solver_using_Distributed_Dynamic_Scheduling","11219782_Dielectrical_spectroscopy_of_canine_myocardium_during_acute_ischemia_and_hypoxia_at_frequency_spectrum_from_100_kHz_to_6_GHz","3019336_A_New_Dual-Primal_Domain_Decomposition_Approach_for_Finite_Element_Simulation_of_3-D_Large-Scale_Electromagnetic_Problems","2632975_A_Fully_Asynchronous_Multifrontal_Solver_Using_Distributed_Dynamic_Scheduling","2306480_A_Restricted_Additive_Schwarz_Preconditioner_For_General_Sparse_Linear_Systems"]}
