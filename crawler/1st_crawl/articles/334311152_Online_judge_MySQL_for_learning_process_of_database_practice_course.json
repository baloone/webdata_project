{"id":"334311152_Online_judge_MySQL_for_learning_process_of_database_practice_course","abstract":"Database course is the main courses in the department of informatics and computer science. This course aims to provide knowledge to students to build and manage data on Database Management Systems (DBMS) like MySQL. Therefore, the implementation of database processing practices in one of the DBMS such as MySQL is very important as basic skills in the field of informatics. With the growing number of informatics students, lectures cannot correct the results of student exercises quickly. For that, we need a system that can help lecturers to make corrections of query exercise on MySQL automatically, which is called Online Judge MySQL. This application was developed using NodeJS to execute queries that users input and ReactJS to build its interfaces. Testing is done by using this application for the online exam in several classes simultaneously. The results show that this application can correct the test results quickly and lightly","authors":["Dwi Puspitasari","Putra Prima Arhandi","Pramana Yoga Saputra","Yan Watequlis Syaifudin"],"meta":["July 2019IOP Conference Series Materials Science and Engineering 523(1):012046","DOI:10.1088/1757-899X/523/1/012046"],"references":["279176900_Methodology_for_Characterization_of_Cognitive_Activities_when_Solving_Programming_Problems_of_an_Algorithmic_Nature","324535046_Rancang_Bangun_Aplikasi_Sistem_Basis_Data_Online_Judge_SBDOJ_untuk_Proses_Pembelajaran_Mata_Kuliah_Sistem_Basis_Data_di_Departemen_Teknik_Informatika_ITS","313467367_Competitive_learning_in_informatics_The_UVa_online_judge_experience","216797523_Architectural_Styles_and_the_Design_of_Network-based_Software_Architectures"]}
