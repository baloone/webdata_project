{"id":"222469115_Directed_Hypergraphs_And_Applications","abstract":"We deal with directed hypergraphs as a tool to model and solve some classes of problems arising in operations research and in computer science. Concepts such as connectivity, paths and cuts are defined. An extension of the main duality results to a special class of hypergraphs is presented. Algorithms to perform visits of hypergraphs and to find optimal paths are studied in detail. Some applications arising in propositional logic, And-Or graphs, relational databases and transportation analysis are presented.","authors":["Giorgio Gallo","Giustino Longo","Stefano Pallottino","Sang Nguyen"],"meta":["April 1993Discrete Applied Mathematics 42(2-3):177-201","DOI:10.1016/0166-218X(93)90045-P"],"references":["268843873_Strongly_Equivalent_Directed_Hypergraphs","220616753_Minimal_Representation_of_Directed_Hypergraphs","220430665_Graph_Algorithms_for_Functional_Dependency_Manipulation","200035354_Additive_ANDOR_graphs","266063069_Principles_of_Database_Systems","265503540_Combinatorial_models_for_searching_in_knowledge_databases","256563265_Formal_aspects_of_the_relational_model","246831338_Minimax_Theorems_for_Normal_Hypergraphs_and_Balanced_Hypergraphs_-_A_Survey","246830733_Minimal_covers_in_the_relational_database_model","246698373_Linear-time_algorithms_for_testing_the_satisfiability_of_propositional_Horn_theories","243783734_Hypergraphs_Combinatorics_of_Finite_Sets","239578108_Computer_Data-Base_Organization","238240255_Graphs_and_H3oergraphs","235127121_The_Art_of_Computer_Programming","230595844_Graphs_and_Hypergraphs","228057735_Computers_And_Intractability_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness","227076390_Hyperpaths_and_Shortest_Hyperpaths","222122003_Equilibrium_Traffic_Assignment_for_Large_Scale_Transit_Networks","221591101_The_Complexity_of_Theorem-Proving_Procedures","220695890_Computers_and_Intracdtability_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness","220547180_Generalized_andor_graphs","220546584_Directed_Recursive_Labelnode_Hypergraphs_A_New_Representation-Language","220432483_Minimum_Covers_in_Relational_Database_Model","220430545_Dynamic_Programming_as_Graph_Searching_An_Algebraic_Approach","220424655_Database_Design_Composing_Fully_Normalized_Tables_from_a_Rigorous_Dependency_Diagram","220153070_Dynamic_Maintenance_of_Directed_Hypergraphs","220118441_Linear-Time_Algorithms_for_Testing_the_Satisfiability_of_Propositional_Horn_Formulae","220118156_Algorithms_for_Testing_the_Satisfiability_of_Propositional_Formulae","220115642_On_the_Complexity_of_the_Maximum_Satisfiability_Problem_for_Horn_Formulas","44490490_Problem-Solving_Methods_in_Artifical_Intelligence","31610517_Principles_of_Database_Systems_JD_Ullman","30873428_Principles_of_Artificial_Intelligence","5067876_GAINFREE_LEONTIEF_FLOW_PROBLEMS","3187040_Deduction_Graphs_An_Algorithm_and_Applications"]}
