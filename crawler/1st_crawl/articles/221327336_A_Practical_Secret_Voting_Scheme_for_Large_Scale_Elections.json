{"id":"221327336_A_Practical_Secret_Voting_Scheme_for_Large_Scale_Elections","abstract":"This paper proposes a practical secret voting scheme for large scale elections. The participants of the scheme are voters, an administrator, and a counter. The scheme ensures the privacy of the voters even if both the administrator and the counter conspire, and realizes voting fairness, i.e., no one can know even intermediate result of the voting. Furthermore fraud by either the voter or the administrator is prohibited.","authors":["Atsushi Fujioka","Tatsuaki Okamoto","Kazuo Ohta"],"meta":["December 1992","DOI:10.1007/3-540-57220-1_66","SourceDBLP","Conference: Advances in Cryptology - AUSCRYPT '92, Workshop on the Theory and Application of Cryptographic Techniques, Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia, December 13-16, 1992, Proceedings"],"references":["234778924_How_to_play_ANY_mental_game","221590203_Completeness_Theorems_for_Non-Cryptographic_Fault-Tolerant_Distributed_Computation_Extended_Abstract","221355323_Multiparty_Unconditionally_Secure_Protocols_Abstract","262363222_Bit_commitment_using_pseudo-randomness_extended_abstract","248742683_Complete_-_ness_theorems_for_non_-_cryptographic_fault_-_tolerant_distributed_computating","245321296_An_electrical_voting_scheme_using_a_single_administrator","234805281_Distributing_the_power_of_a_government_to_enhance_the_privacy_of_voters","221591851_How_to_Play_any_Mental_Game_or_A_Completeness_Theorem_for_Protocols_with_Honest_Majority","221354901_Untraceable_Electronic_Cash","221348668_Elections_with_Unconditionally-Secret_Ballots_and_Disruption_Equivalent_to_Breaking_RSA","220479212_The_Dining_Cryptographers_Problem_Unconditional_Sender_and_Recipient_Intractability","220479038_Bit_Commitment_Using_Pseudorandomness","220420984_Untraceable_Electronic_Mail_Return_Addresses_and_Digital_Pseudonyms","215439657_Security_Without_Identification_Transaction_Systems_to_Make_Big_Brother_Obsolete","3082825_New_Directions_in_Cryptography"]}
