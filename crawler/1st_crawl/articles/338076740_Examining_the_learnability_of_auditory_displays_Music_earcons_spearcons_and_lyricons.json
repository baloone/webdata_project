{"id":"338076740_Examining_the_learnability_of_auditory_displays_Music_earcons_spearcons_and_lyricons","abstract":"Auditory displays are a useful platform to convey information to users for a variety of reasons. The present study sought to examine the use of different types of sounds that can be used in auditory displays—music, earcons, spearcons, and lyricons—to determine which sounds have the highest learnability when presented in sequences. Participants were self-trained on sound meanings and then asked to recall meanings after listening to sequences of varying lengths. The relatedness of sounds and their attributed meanings, or the intuitiveness of the sounds, was also examined. The results show that participants were able to learn and recall lyricons and spearcons the best, and related meaning is an important contributing variable to learnability and memorability of all sound types. This should open the door for future research and experimentation of lyricons and spearcons presented in auditory streams.","authors":["Kay Tislar","Zackery Duford","Brittany Nelson","Madeline Peabody"],"meta":["June 2018"],"references":["258884606_Lyricons_Lyrics_Earcons_Designing_a_New_Auditory_Cue_Combining_Speech_and_Sounds","236068918_Spearcons_Speech-Based_Earcons_Improve_Navigation_Performance_in_Advanced_Auditory_Menus","221515744_An_evaluation_of_earcons_for_use_in_auditory_human-computer_interfaces","14725151_Common_Factors_in_the_Identification_of_an_Assortment_of_Brief_Everyday_Sounds","314815605_Sonification_Supports_Eyes-Free_Respiratory_Monitoring_and_Task_Time-Sharing","269204256_Auditory_weather_reports","262252005_Measuring_comprehension_in_sonification_tasks_that_have_multiple_data_streams","258853238_The_psychology_experiment_building_language_PEBL_and_PEBL_test_battery","213798756_Earcons_and_Icons_Their_Structure_and_Common_Design_Principles","17619072_Primary_auditory_stream_segregation_and_perception_of_order_in_rapid_sequences_of_tones"]}
