{"id":"220245541_Fibred_and_Indexed_Categories_for_Abstract_Model_Theory","abstract":"Indexed and Fibred category theory have a long tradition in computer science as a language to formalize different presentations\nof the notion of a logic, as for instance, in the theory of institutions and general logics, and as unifying models of (categorical)\nlogic and type theory as well. Here we introduce the notions of indexed and fibred frames and construct a rich mathematical\nworkspace where many relevant and useful concepts of logics can be elegantly modelled. To demonstrate the applicability of\nthese tools, essential ideas around the theory of institutions are recasted and described.","authors":["Alfio Martini","Uwe Wolter","Edward Hermann Haeusler"],"meta":["September 2007Logic Journal of IGPL 15(5):707-739","DOI:10.1093/jigpal/jzm045","SourceDBLP"],"references":["319393508_Foundations_of_Heterogeneous_Specification","236607603_Four_Institutions_--_A_Unified_Presentation_of_Logical_Systems_for_Specification","227169721_Extra_Theory_Morphisms_for_Institutions_Logical_Semantics_for_Multi-Paradigm_Languages","226106039_Grothendieck_Institutions","2492095_Comorphism-Based_Grothendieck_Logics","2400082_Heterogeneous_Development_Graphs_and_Heterogeneous_Borrowing","250685181_Axioms_for_abstract_model_theory","247584666_Some_fundamental_algebraic_tools_for_the_semantic_of_computation","243696859_Categorical_Logic_and_Type_Theory","239020250_Sheaves_in_Geometry_and_Logic","234778153_Putting_theories_together_to_make_specifications","229676827_On_Extensions_of_Elementary_Logic","223265863_May_I_Borrow_Your_Logic_Transporting_Logical_Structures_along_Maps","222279869_Some_Fundamental_Algebraic_Tools_for_the_Semantics_of_Computation_Part_3_Indexed_Categories","220691291_Category_theory_for_computing_science","220431549_Institutions_Abstract_Model_Theory_for_Specification_and_Programming","50852994_Handbook_of_Modal_Logic","44502327_First_order_categorical_logic_model-theoretical_methods_in_the_theory_of_topoi_and_related_categories_by_Michael_Malkkai_and_Gonzalo_E_Reyes","38382109_Fibered_Categories_and_the_Foundations_of_Naive_Category_Theory","33717644_Relating_arrows_between_institutions_in_a_categorical_framework","2849085_Institution_Morphisms"]}
