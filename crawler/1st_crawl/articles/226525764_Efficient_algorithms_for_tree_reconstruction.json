{"id":"226525764_Efficient_algorithms_for_tree_reconstruction","abstract":"In this note, we show thatO(n logn) operations are sufficient to reconstruct an ordered binary tree given its inorder traversal and either its preorder or postorder traversal. An alternative linear representation allows reconstruction usingO(n) operations.","authors":["W. Slough","Kemal Efe"],"meta":["June 1989BIT.
