{"id":"323753857_Association_between_dental_fluorosis_with_dental_caries_in_children_from_5_to_14_years_old_in_Huila's_public_educative_institutions_in_Colombia","abstract":"The department of Huila does not have information to identify and focus public oral health programs that detect the fluorosis and dental caries problem. This allows government entities to plan their epidemiological surveillance system. Determine the association in dental fluorosis and dental caries in children between 5 to 14 years old in Huilaâ€™s public educative institutions. A study was carried out with 482 boys and girls of public educative institutions, the Dental Caries diagnosis was made by ICDAS standards and Dental Fluorosis with DEAN Guideline. The OR was determined and a logistic regression was made to prove the Variables Associations.\nBivariate analysis through odds ratio (OR) and logistic regression were used to identify the difference between the decay and the independent variables. Significant statistical differences were founded with age and association with children who do not the teeth brush immediately after each meal (OR 1,63; p=0,02) and Dental Fluorosis (OR 2,63; p=0,006). In conclusion, the Dental Fluorosis was identified as a risk factor to Dental Caries development. It is important to provide information about oral health program to communities of educative institutions.","authors":["Claudia Lorena Garcia Rojas","Armando Roa Navarro","Walter Losada Farfan","Ruthber Rodriguez"],"meta":["January 2018Contemporary Engineering Sciences 11(8):371-377","DOI:10.12988/ces.2018.8230"],"references":["317509673_Effect_of_fluoride_on_salivary_immunoglobulins_and_sialic_acid","315802986_The_role_of_parental_rearing_practices_and_family_demographics_on_oral_health-related_quality_of_life_in_children","314165039_Impact_of_caries_and_dental_fluorosis_on_oral_health-related_quality_of_life_a_cross-sectional_study_in_schoolchildren_receiving_water_naturally_fluoridated_at_above-optimal_levels","311918676_Risk_factors_and_prevalence_of_dental_fluorosis_and_dental_caries_in_school_children_of_North_India","307553081_Oral_health_in_the_agenda_of_priorities_in_public_health","301669162_Fluoride_Content_of_Bottled_Drinking_Waters_in_Qatar","290221223_Caries_and_Dental_Fluorosis_Among_7-to_12-Year-Old_Children_From_Low-_and_Moderate-Fluoride_Areas_in_Turkey","320963456_Caries_with_Dental_Fluorosis_and_Oral_Health_Behaviour_Among_12-Year_School_Children_in_Moderate-Fluoride_Drinking_Water_Community_in_Quetta_Pakistan","312510879_Concentrations_of_fluoride_in_water_and_plasma_for_US_children_and_adolescents_Data_from_NHANES_2013-2014","303709831_Prevalence_of_dental_fluorosis_among_primary_school_children_in_association_with_different_water_fluoride_levels_in_Mysore_district_Karnataka"]}
