{"id":"250956239_Covering_Multigraphs_by_Simple_Circuits","abstract":"Answering a question raised in [SIAM J. Comput., 10 (1981), pp. 746â€“750], we show that every bridgeless multigraph with v vertices and e edges can be covered by simple circuits whose total length is at most $\\min ( \\tfrac{5}{3} e, e + \\tfrac{7}{3} v - \\tfrac{7}{3} )$. Our proof supplies an efficient algorithm for finding such a cover.","authors":["N. Alon","M.
