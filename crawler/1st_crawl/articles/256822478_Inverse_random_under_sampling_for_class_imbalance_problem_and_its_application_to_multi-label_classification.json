{"id":"256822478_Inverse_random_under_sampling_for_class_imbalance_problem_and_its_application_to_multi-label_classification","abstract":"In this paper, a novel inverse random under sampling (IRUS) method is proposed for the class imbalance problem. The main idea is to severely under sample the majority class thus creating a large number of distinct training sets. For each training set we then find a decision boundary which separates the minority class from the majority class. By combining the multiple designs through fusion, we construct a composite boundary between the majority class and the minority class. The proposed methodology is applied on 22 UCI data sets and experimental results indicate a significant increase in performance when compared with many existing class-imbalance learning methods. We also present promising results for multi-label classification, a challenging research problem in many modern applications such as music, text and image categorization.","authors":["Muhammad Atif Tahir","Josef Kittler","Fei Yan"],"meta":["October 2012Pattern Recognition 45(10):3738â€“3750","DOI:10.1016/j.patcog.2012.03.014"],"references":["288623967_Multilabel_classification_of_music_into_emotions","228612392_On_the_Class_Imbalance_Problem","228578039_C4_5_and_imbalanced_data_sets_investigating_the_effect_of_sampling_method_probabilistic_estimate_and_decision_tree_structure","228084517_Mixture_of_expert_agents_for_handling_imbalanced_data_sets","228084510_Combining_Bagging_and_Boosting","227319967_Classifier_Chains_for_Multi-label_Classification","226649250_Random_k-Labelsets_An_Ensemble_Method_for_Multilabel_Classification","225986997_Mining_Multi-label_Data","225132277_Improving_Identification_of_Difficult_Small_Classes_by_Balancing_Class_Distribution","224654534_Efficient_Classification_of_Multi-label_and_Imbalanced_Data_using_Min-Max_Modular_Classifiers","224330871_Multi-Label_Imbalanced_Data_Enrichment_Process_in_Neural_Net_Classifier_Training","221900796_A_Review_on_Ensembles_for_the_Class_Imbalance_Problem_Bagging-_Boosting-_and_Hybrid-Based_Approaches","221093891_A_Multiple_Expert_Approach_to_the_Class_Imbalance_Problem_Using_Inverse_Random_under_Sampling","220723464_Multi-label_classification_of_music_into_emotions","220543125_SMOTE_Synthetic_Minority_Over-sampling_Technique","220520041_A_Study_of_the_Behavior_of_Several_Methods_for_Balancing_machine_Learning_Training_Data","220073602_Random_k-Labelsets_for_Multi-Label_Classification","6992544_Asymmetric_Bagging_and_Random_Subspace_for_Support_Vector_Machines-Based_Relevance_Feedback_in_Image_Retrieval","5316519_Asymmetric_bagging_and_feature_selection_for_activities_prediction_of_drug_molecules","2363115_The_Role_of_Combining_Rules_in_Bagging_and_Boosting","2256438_Toward_Scalable_Learning_with_Non-uniform_Class_and_Cost_Distributions_A_Case_Study_in_Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection","2239944_Webb_GI_MultiBoosting_A_Technique_for_Combining_Boosting_and_Wagging_Machine_Learning_40_159-196","275340906_Random_Forests","265437473_Two_modifications_of_CNN","242793084_Learning_multi-label_scene_classification1","242414156_Classification_and_Regression_Trees_Bagging_and_Boosting","239557381_The_Condensed_Nearest_Neighbor_Rule","226349371_Combining_Instance-Based_Learning_and_Logistic_Regression_for_Multilabel_Classification","226270700_Bagging_Predictors","224541268_Learning_from_Imbalanced_Data","224360197_Exploratory_Undersampling_for_Class-Imbalance_Learning","223350899_An_asymmetric_classifier_based_on_partial_least_squares","222836025_Cost-sensitive_boosting_for_classification_of_imbalanced_data","222709440_ML-KNN_A_lazy_learning_approach_to_multi-label_leaming","222430151_Learning_multi-label_scene_classification","221619768_A_Kernel_Method_for_Multi-Labelled_Classification","221345281_Reducing_Misclassification_Costs","221139149_An_Empirical_Analysis_of_Under-Sampling_Techniques_to_Balance_a_Protein_Structural_Class_Dataset","220766726_Exploratory_Under-Sampling_for_Class-Imbalance_Learning","220600474_Do_unbalanced_data_have_a_negative_effect_on_LDA","220571380_The_Class_Imbalance_Problem_A_Systematic_Study","220344089_Multilabel_classification_via_calibrated_label_ranking","220198530_Roughly_balanced_Bagging_for_Imbalanced_data","220072725_Bayes_Vector_Quantizer_for_Class-Imbalance_Problem","38348679_Heuristics_of_Instability_and_Stabilization_in_Model_Selection_The_Annals_of_Statistics_246_2350-2383","3192827_On_Combining_Classifiers","3081362_The_Condensed_Nearest_Neighbor_Rule","2624358_Addressing_the_Curse_of_Imbalanced_Training_Sets_One-Sided_Selection","2289964_On_Bagging_and_Nonlinear_Estimation"]}
