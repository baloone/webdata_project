{"id":"352145945_Cross-Country_Analysis_of_User_Profiles_for_Graph-Based_Location_Estimation","abstract":"Social media is used all over the world. Although the home location attribute is available anywhere, few studies have been conducted on the differences in the performance of home location estimation between countries. Because social media is used differently in different countries, the difference between countries in terms of users’ relationships needs to be investigated. We consider the performance of graph-based home location estimation in capturing users’ relationships, as it is affected by users’ social media usage. We analyze user profiles in 10 countries by graph-based estimation and find that some profile attributes, in particular, contribute to the estimation performance for all the countries examined.","authors":["Shiori Hironaka","Mitsuo Yoshida","Kyoji Umemura"],"meta":["June 2021IEEE Access PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3086523"],"references":["343122785_Geographical_fragmentation_of_the_global_network_of_Twitter_communications","327021708_How_self-disclosure_in_Twitter_profiles_relate_to_anonymity_consciousness_and_usage_objectives_a_cross-cultural_study","325827578_Bumper_Stickers_on_the_Twitter_Highway_Analyzing_the_Speed_and_Substance_of_Profile_Changes","318741998_How_Does_Twitter_User_Behavior_Vary_Across_Demographic_Groups","343872420_An_overview_of_microblog_user_geolocation_methods","341123851_Twitter_User_Location_Inference_Based_on_Representation_Learning_and_Label_Propagation","336632118_User's_Centrality_Analysis_for_Home_Location_Estimation","323341915_Twitter_user_geolocation_by_filtering_of_highly_mentioned_users","321324876_When_Do_Users_Change_Their_Profile_Information_on_Twitter","318739731_Unifying_Text_Metadata_and_User_Network_Representations_with_a_Neural_Network_for_Geolocation_Prediction"]}
