{"id":"316955496_Equidistributions_of_Mahonian_Statistics_over_Pattern_Avoiding_Permutations","abstract":"A Mahonian d-function is a Mahonian statistic that can be expressed as a linear combination of vincular pattern functions of length at most d. Babson and Ste- ingr√≠msson classified all Mahonian 3-functions up to trivial bijections and identified many of them with well-known Mahonian statistics in the literature. We prove a host of Mahonian 3-function equidistributions over permutations in Sn avoiding a single classical pattern in S3. Tools used include block decomposition, Dyck paths and generating functions.","authors":["Nima Amini"],"meta":["May 2017The Electronic Journal of Combinatorics 25(1)","DOI:10.37236/7137"],"references":["281299448_On_joint_distribution_of_adjacencies_descents_and_some_Mahonian_statistics","236844219_Inversion_polynomials_for_321-avoiding_permutations","236737553_Total_occurrence_statistics_on_restricted_permutations","2942109_Multiple_Pattern_Avoidance_with_Respect_to_Fixed_Points_and_Excedances","2105017_Fixed_Points_and_Excedances_in_Restricted_Permutations","1922962_Classification_of_bijections_between_321-_and_132-avoiding_permutations","316986935_A_New_Bijective_Proof_of_Babson_and_Steingrimsson's_Conjecture","289727378_Dyck_tilings_linear_extensions_descents_and_inversions_extended_abstract","285331923_Note_sur_les_inversions_ou_derangements_produits_dans_les_permutations","273957365_Lattice_Path_Enumeration","265626253_Denert's_Permutation_Statistic_Is_Indeed_Euler-Mahonian","265445639_Restricted_Permutations","265422232_Combinatory_analysis_Vol_2","259528681_Refining_Enumeration_Schemes_to_Count_According_to_Permutation_Statistics","230801585_Counting_occurrences_of_a_pattern_of_type_12_or_21_in_permutations","229267292_Babson-Steingrimsson_Statistics_are_Indeed_Mahonian_and_Sometimes_Even_Euler-Mahonian","224039652_Wilf_Equivalence_for_the_Charge_Statistic","222861950_Octabasic_Laguerre_polynomials_and_permutation_statistics","222577967_Permutations_with_Restricted_Patterns_and_Dyck_Paths","222513675_Generalized_Pattern_Avoidance","222493693_New_Euler-Mahonian_Statistics_on_Permutations_and_Words","221710904_Lehmer_code_transforms_and_Mahonian_statistics_on_permutations","220297174_Area_of_Catalan_paths_on_a_checkerboard","220191621_Catalan_continued_fractions_and_increasing_subsequences_in_permutations","51939837_Permutation_patterns_and_statistics","48194382_Mahonian_Pairs","2633668_Generalized_permutation_patterns_and_a_classification_of_the_Mahonian_statistics","1916597_On_bijections_between_231-avoiding_permutations_and_Dyck_paths"]}
