{"id":"332883201_Axiomatising_Logics_with_Separating_Conjunction_and_Modalities","abstract":"Modal separation logics are formalisms that combine modal operators to reason locally, with separating connectives that allow to perform global updates on the models. In this work, we design Hilbert-style proof systems for the modal separation logics MSL(*,D) and MSL(*,<>), where * is the separating conjunction, <> is the standard modal operator and D is the difference modality. The calculi only use the logical languages at hand (no external features such as labels) and take advantage of new normal forms and of their axiomatisation.","authors":["Stephane Demri","Raul Fervari","Alessio Mansutti"],"meta":["May 2019","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-19570-0_45","Conference: European Conference on Logics in Artificial Intelligence","Project: Decision Procedures for Separation Logics"],"references":["345379748_The_Power_of_Modal_Separation_Logics","326197607_Modal_logics_of_sabotage_revisited","325299198_Why_Separation_Logic_Works","324518990_The_Effects_of_Adding_Reachability_Predicates_in_Propositional_Separation_Logic","320727546_Modular_Labelled_Sequent_Calculi_for_Abstract_Separation_Logics","344486660_Modal_Logic","340421919_Parametric_completeness_for_separation_theories","332425855_A_public_announcement_separation_logic","328780100_Reasoning_about_sequences_of_memory_states","322886219_On_the_Expressive_Completeness_of_Bernays-Schonfinkel-Ramsey_Separation_Logic"]}
