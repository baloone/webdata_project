{"id":"321056906_Semi-Supervised_Deep_Learning_Using_Pseudo_Labels_for_Hyperspectral_Image_Classification","abstract":"Deep learning has gained popularity in a variety of computer vision tasks. Recently, it has also been successfully applied for hyperspectral image classification tasks. Training deep neural networks such as a convolutional neural network (CNN) for classification requires a large number of labeled samples. However, in remote sensing applications, we usually only have a small amount of labeled data for training because they are expensive to collect, although we still have abundant unlabeled data. In this paper, we propose semi-supervised deep learning for hyperspectral image classification – our approach uses limited labeled data and abundant unlabeled data to train a deep neural network. More specifically, we use deep convolutional recurrent neural networks (CRNN) for hyperspectral image classification by treating each hyperspectral pixel as a spectral sequence. In the proposed semi-supervised learning framework, the abundant unlabeled data are utilized with their pseudo labels (cluster labels). We propose to use all the training data together with their pseudo labels to pre-train a deep CRNN, and then fine-tune using the limited available labeled data. Further, to utilize spatial information in the hyperspectral images, we propose a constrained Dirichlet process mixture model (C-DPMM), a non-parametric Bayesian clustering algorithm, for semi-supervised clustering which includes pairwise must-link and cannot-link constraints – this produces high-quality pseudo-labels, resulting in improved initialization of the deep neural network. We also derived a variational inference (VI) model for the C-DPMM for efficient inference. Experimental results with real hyperspectral image datasets demonstrate that the proposed semi-supervised method outperforms state-of-the-art supervised and semi-supervised learning methods for hyperspectral classification.","authors":["Hao Wu","Saurabh Prasad"],"meta":["November 2017IEEE Transactions on Image Processing PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TIP.2017.2772836"],"references":["316651894_Morphologically_Decoupled_Structured_Sparsity_for_Rotation-Invariant_Hyperspectral_Image_Analysis","304029484_Learning_a_Transferable_Change_Rule_from_a_Recurrent_Neural_Network_for_Land_Cover_Change_Detection","301839500_TensorFlow_Large-Scale_Machine_Learning_on_Heterogeneous_Distributed_Systems","282478197_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_Hyperspectral_Image_Classification","279968088_Semi-Supervised_Learning_with_Ladder_Network","277411157_Deep_Learning","265252627_Neural_Machine_Translation_by_Jointly_Learning_to_Align_and_Translate","264564342_Deep_Learning-Based_Classification_of_Hyperspectral_Data","262877889_Learning_Phrase_Representations_using_RNN_Encoder-Decoder_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation","254212736_Variational_inference_for_Dirichlet_process_mixtures","251452566_Unsupervised_and_Constrained_Dirichlet_Process_Mixture_Models_for_Verb_Clustering","229100417_A_Constructive_Definition_of_the_Dirichlet_Prior","228339739_Viualizing_data_using_t-SNE","226435002_An_Introduction_to_Variational_Methods_for_Graphical_Models","225797350_Nonparametric_Bayesian_Image_Segmentation","224166337_A_tutorial_overview_of_anomaly_detection_in_hyperspectral_images","220320676_Stacked_Denoising_Autoencoders_Learning_Useful_Representations_in_a_Deep_Network_with_a_Local_Denoising_Criterion","319770465_Sequence_to_Sequence_Learning_with_Neural_Networks","319770430_Rich_feature_hierarchies_for_accurate_object_detection_and_semantic_segmentation","319770291_Very_Deep_Convolutional_Networks_for_Large-Scale_Image_Recognition","319770184_Speech_Recognition_With_Deep_Recurrent_Neural_Networks","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","319660414_Semi-Supervised_Dimensionality_Reduction_of_Hyperspectral_Imagery_using_Pseudo-Labels","317722949_Rotation_invariance_through_structured_sparsity_for_robust_hyperspectral_image_classification","315503884_Convolutional_Recurrent_Neural_Networks_forHyperspectral_Data_Classification","311609041_Deep_Residual_Learning_for_Image_Recognition","308849013_Convolutional_recurrent_neural_networks_Learning_spatial_dependencies_for_image_representation","303516820_The_infinite_Gaussian_mixture_model","301857163_Efficient_Character-level_Document_Classification_by_Combining_Convolution_and_Recurrent_Layers","301719606_Dirichlet_Process_Based_Active_Learning_and_Discovery_of_Unknown_Classes_for_Hyperspectral_Image_Classification","299671386_Spectral_Graph_Theory","289587906_Variational_Inference_A_Review_for_Statisticians","288623601_Towards_end-to-end_speech_recognition_with_recurrent_neural_networks","286512696_Deep_Residual_Learning_for_Image_Recognition","280497984_Fast_and_Accurate_Recurrent_Neural_Network_Acoustic_Models_for_Speech_Recognition","272390926_Superpixels_for_Spatially_Reinforced_Bayesian_Classification_of_Hyperspectral_Images","271512969_Probabilistic_Inference_Using_Markov_Chain_Monte_Carlo_Methods","271482969_Infinite_Gaussian_mixture_models_for_robust_decision_fusion_of_hyperspectral_imagery_and_full_waveform_LiDAR_data","265554383_Sequence_to_Sequence_Learning_with_Neural_Networks","265385906_Very_Deep_Convolutional_Networks_for_Large-Scale_Image_Recognition","260622508_Semi-Supervised_Hyperspectral_Image_Classification_Using_Spatio-Spectral_Laplacian_Support_Vector_Machine","258818168_Speech_Recognition_with_Deep_Recurrent_Neural_Networks","258374356_Rich_Feature_Hierarchies_for_Accurate_Object_Detection_and_Semantic_Segmentation","248512106_Pattern_Recognition_and_Machine_Learning_Errata","247931354_Elements_of_information_theory_2_ed","227992567_Elements_of_Information_Theory","224353020_Spectral_and_Spatial_Classification_of_Hyperspectral_Data_Using_SVMs_and_Morphological_Profiles","221618837_Accelerated_Variational_Dirichlet_Process_Mixtures","221364450_Entropy_rate_superpixel_segmentation","221345031_Semi-supervised_learning_of_compact_document_representations_with_deep_networks","200688680_Semi-Supervised_Learning_Literature_Survey","38357862_Mixtures_of_Dirichlet_Processes_With_Applications_to_Bayesian_Nonparametric_Problems","38357634_A_Bayesian_Analysis_of_Some_Non-Parametric_Problems","7647316_Framewise_phoneme_classification_with_bidirectional_LSTM_and_other_neural_network_architectures","6912170_Reducing_the_Dimensionality_of_Data_with_Neural_Networks"]}
