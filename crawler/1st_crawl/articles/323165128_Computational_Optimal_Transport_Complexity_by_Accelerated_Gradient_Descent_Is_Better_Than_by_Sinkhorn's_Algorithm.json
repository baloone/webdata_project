{"id":"323165128_Computational_Optimal_Transport_Complexity_by_Accelerated_Gradient_Descent_Is_Better_Than_by_Sinkhorn's_Algorithm","abstract":"We analyze two algorithms for approximating the general optimal transport (OT) distance between two discrete distributions of size $n$, up to accuracy $\\varepsilon$. For the first algorithm, which is based on the celebrated Sinkhorn's algorithm, we prove the complexity bound $\\widetilde{O}\\left({n^2/\\varepsilon^2}\\right)$ arithmetic operations. For the second one, which is based on our novel Adaptive Primal-Dual Accelerated Gradient Descent (APDAGD) algorithm, we prove the complexity bound $\\widetilde{O}\\left(\\min\\left\\{n^{9/4}/\\varepsilon, n^{2}/\\varepsilon^2 \\right\\}\\right)$ arithmetic operations. Both bounds have better dependence on $\\varepsilon$ than the state-of-the-art result given by $\\widetilde{O}\\left({n^2/\\varepsilon^3}\\right)$. Our second algorithm not only has better dependence on $\\varepsilon$ in the complexity bound, but also is not specific to entropic regularization and can solve the OT problem with different regularizers.","authors":["Pavel Dvurechensky","Alexander Gasnikov","Alexey Kroshnin"],"meta":["February 2018","Project: Computational Optimal Transport"],"references":["318374530_Optimal_Mass_Transport_Signal_processing_and_machine-learning_applications","317579201_Multilevel_Clustering_via_Wasserstein_Means","314797421_Construction_of_Non-asymptotic_Confidence_Sets_in_2-Wasserstein_Space","304589395_Accelerated_First-Order_Primal-Dual_Proximal_Methods_for_Linearly_Constrained_Composite_Convex_Programming","321067380_Matrix_Scaling_and_Balancing_via_Box_Constrained_Newton's_Method_and_Interior_Point_Methods","321067378_Much_Faster_Algorithms_for_Matrix_Scaling","320464877_Smooth_and_Sparse_Optimal_Transport","312913129_On_the_translocation_of_masses","309317370_Stabilized_Sparse_Scaling_Algorithms_for_Entropy_Regularized_Transport_Problems","304410977_Rate_of_convergence_analysis_of_a_dual_fast_gradient_method_for_general_convex_optimization","299402132_Amplitude_and_phase_variation_of_point_processes","279632608_Optimal_Transport_for_Domain_Adaptation","303655962_Stochastic_Optimization_for_Large-scale_Optimal_Transport","303353658_Efficient_numerical_methods_for_entropy-linear_programming_problems","303337152_Diagonal_equivalence_to_matrices_with_prescribed_row_and_column_sums_II"]}
