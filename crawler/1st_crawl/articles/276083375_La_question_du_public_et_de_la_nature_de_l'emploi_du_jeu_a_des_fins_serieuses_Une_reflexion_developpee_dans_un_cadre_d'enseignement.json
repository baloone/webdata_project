But this type of course is often considered a French course and therefore with no interest by the most of students. Also, in order to interest students, we tried to set up few kinds of serious games. To do this, we tried to understand what could be a serious game in function of its terminology, its origins and the “prototype semantics”. We then identified few games that could be adapted to our courses. We report at the end of this paper, three experiments using the games to teaching. These kinds of games use some aspects of competitive games, role playing games and construction games.","authors":["Stéphane Goria"],"meta":["December 2014Interfaces Numériques 3(3):521-539","DOI:10.3166/rin.3.521-5399","Project: Détournement de jeux à des fins sérieuses"],"references":["282452768_La_gamification_de_la_vie_sous_couleur_de_jouer","281356291_Les_utilites_du_jeu_video_serieux_finalites_discours_et_mises_en_correlation","327538319_L'apprentissage_par_projet","305389648_Les_jeux_de_roles","273947355_Playing_at_the_World_A_History_of_Simulating_Wars_People_and_Fantastic_Adventures_From_Chess_to_Role-Playing_Games","261302117_Developing_Serious_Games"]}
