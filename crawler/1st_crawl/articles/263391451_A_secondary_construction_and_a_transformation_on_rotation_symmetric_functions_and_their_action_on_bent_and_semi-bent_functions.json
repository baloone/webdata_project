{"id":"263391451_A_secondary_construction_and_a_transformation_on_rotation_symmetric_functions_and_their_action_on_bent_and_semi-bent_functions","abstract":"We study more in detail the relationship between rotation symmetric (RS) functions and idempotents, in univariate and bivariate representations, and deduce a construction of bent RS functions from semi-bent RS functions. We deduce the first infinite classes found of idempotent and RS bent functions of algebraic degree more than 3. We introduce a transformation from any RS Boolean function f over GF(2)n into the idempotent Boolean function f′(z)=f(z,z2,…,z2n−1)f′(z)=f(z,z2,…,z2n−1) over GF(2n)GF(2n), leading to another RS Boolean function. The trace representation of f′f′ is directly deduced from the algebraic normal form of f , but we show that f and f′f′, which have the same algebraic degree, are in general not affinely equivalent to each other. We exhibit infinite classes of functions f such that (1) f is bent and f′f′ is not (2) f′f′ is bent and f is not (3) f and f′f′ are both bent (we show that this is always the case for quadratic functions and we also investigate cubic functions).","authors":["Claude Carlet","Guangpu Gao","Wenfen Liu"],"meta":["September 2014Journal of Combinatorial Theory Series A 127(1):161–175","DOI:10.1016/j.jcta.2014.05.008"],"references":["228720083_Boolean_Functions_for_Cryptography_and_Error_Correcting_Codes","224242489_Balanced_rotation_symmetric_boolean_functions_with_maximum_algebraic_immunity","221420618_Generalized_Rotation_Symmetric_and_Dihedral_Symmetric_Boolean_Functions_-_9_Variable_Boolean_Functions_with_Nonlinearity_242","220942650_Results_on_Rotation_Symmetric_Bent_and_Correlation_Immune_Boolean_Functions","220332964_A_NOTE_ON_SEMI-BENT_BOOLEAN_FUNCTIONS","3079780_On_some_cosets_of_the_first-order_Reed-Muller_code_with_high_minimum_weight","295252630_Results_on_Constructions_of_Rotation_Symmetric_Bent_and_Semi-bent_Functions","285105779_Boolean_Models_and_Methods_in_Mathematics_Computer_Science_and_Engineering","265334005_Elementary_Hadamard_difference_sets","260576544_Hyperbent_Functions_via_Dillon-Like_Exponents","256391988_On_bent_functions","254060734_Constructions_of_Quadratic_and_Cubic_Rotation_Symmetric_Bent_Functions","254057278_On_Semibent_Boolean_Functions","244955263_A_family_of_Noncyclic_Difierence_Sets","233753113_Linearized_polynomials_over_finite_fields_revisited","224243758_Semibent_Functions_From_Dillon_and_Niho_Exponents_Kloosterman_Sums_and_Dickson_Polynomials","223319299_Rotation_symmetric_Boolean_functions-Count_and_cryptographic_properties","222517024_Results_on_rotation_symmetric_bent_functions","222399267_Rotation_Symmetric_Boolean_Functions_-_Count_and_Cryptographic_Properties","221348262_Highly_Nonlinear_Balanced_Boolean_Functions_with_a_Good_Correlation-Immunity","220798542_Rotation-Symmetric_Functions_and_Fast_Hashing","220678928_Search_for_Boolean_Functions_With_Excellent_Profiles_in_the_Rotation_Symmetric_Class","220638623_On_EA-equivalence_of_certain_permutations_to_power_mappings","220349047_Rotation-Symmetric_Functions_and_Fast_Hashing","220337289_On_Dillon's_class_H_of_bent_functions_Niho_bent_functions_and_o-polynomials","220334755_Hyper-bent_functions_via_Dillon-like_exponents","220078696_Construction_of_bent_functions_via_Niho_Power_Functions","220076946_A_Family_of_Difference_Sets_in_Non-cyclic_Groups","220074811_On_Bent_Functions","3086110_Bent_Functions_With_Niho_Exponents","2881892_A_New_Characterization_of_Semi-bent_and_Bent_Functions_on_Finite_Fields"]}
