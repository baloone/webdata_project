{"id":"280235950_Towards_Modelling_of_Local_Reversibility","abstract":"We describe a new operator for reversible process calculi that allows us to model locally controlled reversibility. In our setting, actions can be undone spontaneously or as a part of pairs of so-called concerted actions, where performing forwards a weak action forces undoing of another action, without the need of a global control or a memory. We model an example from chemistry, the simple interaction of two water molecules, and give an informal explanation of the role of the new operator.","authors":["Stefan Kuhn","Irek Ulidowski"],"meta":["July 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-20860-2_19","Conference: Reversible ComputationAt: Grenoble"],"references":["262279575_Concurrent_Flexible_Reversibility","261157289_A_Compositional_Semantics_for_the_Reversible_p-Calculus","220700934_Reversible_Communicating_Systems","220700540_Controlling_Reversibility_in_Higher-Order_Pi","220118443_Reversing_algebraic_process_calculi","283364215_A_Reversible_Process_Calculus_and_the_Modelling_of_the_ERK_Signalling_Pathway","279957008_Texts_in_Theoretical_Computer_Science_An_EATCS_Series","266909462_Concurrency_and_Reversibility","262237415_Modelling_of_Bonding_with_Processes_and_Events","261858451_Reversibility_and_Asymmetric_Conflict_in_Event_Structures","222783480_Reversing_Algebraic_Process_Calculi","222398714_Formal_Molecular_Biology","221218575_Causal_pi-Calculus_for_Biochemical_Modelling","220700991_Reversing_Higher-Order_Pi","12069813_Representation_and_simulation_of_biochemical_processes_using_the-calculus_process_algebra","2530500_Causal_pi-Calculus_for_Biochemical_Modelling"]}
