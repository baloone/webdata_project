{"id":"269226394_Mastery_grids_An_open-source_social_educational_progress_visualization","abstract":"Many pieces of educational software are underused by students. Open learning model and social visualization are two approaches which have been helpful in ameliorating that low usage problem. This article introduces a fusion of these two ideas in a form of social progress visualization. A classroom evaluation indicates that this combination may be effective in engaging students, guiding them to suitable content, and enabling faster content access.","authors":["Tomasz Loboda","Julio Guerra","Roya Hosseini","Peter Brusilovsky"],"meta":["June 2014","DOI:10.1145/2591708.2609840","Conference: the 2014 conference on Innovation & technology in computer science educationAt: Uppsala, Sweden"],"references":["266656951_Mastery_Grids_An_Open_Source_Social_Educational_Progress_Visualization","259781741_Progressor_Social_navigation_support_through_open_social_student_modeling","235663648_Problem_Solving_Examples_as_First_Class_Objects_in_Educational_Digital_Libraries_Three_Obstacles_to_Overcome","229860609_Using_Community_Visualization_to_Stimulate_Participation_in_Online_Communities","229674759_Guiding_students_to_the_right_questions_Adaptive_navigation_support_in_an_E-Learning_system_for_Java_programming","228788763_Group_Interaction_Prompted_by_a_Simple_Assessed_Open_Learner_Model_that_can_be_Optionally_Released_to_Peers","262317857_Student_Models_that_Invite_the_Learner_In_The_SMILI_Open_Learner_Modelling_Framework","242635937_Ai_in_cai_an_artificial_intelligence_approach_to_computer-aided_instruction","227613096_Dynamic_Courseware_Generation_on_the_WWW","225230788_Knowledge_tracing_Modeling_the_acquisition_of_procedural_knowledge"]}
