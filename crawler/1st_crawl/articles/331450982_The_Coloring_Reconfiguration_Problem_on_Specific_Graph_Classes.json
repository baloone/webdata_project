{"id":"331450982_The_Coloring_Reconfiguration_Problem_on_Specific_Graph_Classes","abstract":"We study the problem of transforming one (vertex) c-coloring of a graph into another one by changing only one vertex color assignment at a time, while at all times maintaining a c-coloring, where c denotes the number of colors. This decision problem is known to be PSPACE-complete even for bipartite graphs and any fixed constant c ≥ 4. In this paper, we study the problem from the viewpoint of graph classes. We first show that the problem remains PSPACE-complete for chordal graphs even if c is a fixed constant. We then demonstrate that, even when c is a part of input, the problem is solvable in polynomial time for several graph classes, such as k-trees with any integer k ≥ 1, split graphs, and trivially perfect graphs.","authors":["Tatsuhiko HATANAKA","Takehiro ITO","Xiao Zhou"],"meta":["March 2019IEICE Transactions on Information and Systems E102.D(3):423-429","DOI:10.1587/transinf.2018FCP0005"],"references":["324653146_Introduction_to_Reconfiguration","282073028_Using_Contracted_Solution_Graphs_for_Solving_Reconfiguration_Problems","281262549_A_Dichotomy_Theorem_for_Circular_Colouring_Reconfiguration","276458326_Finding_Shortest_Paths_Between_Graph_Colourings","264708930_Homomorphism_reconfiguration_via_homotopy","261101166_Recoloring_graphs_via_tree_decompositions","259220468_The_Complexity_of_Change","257585896_Reconfiguration_graphs_for_vertex_colourings_of_chordal_and_chordal_bipartite_graphs","220548745_Finding_Paths_Between_3-Colorings","267373223_Mixing_Graph_Colourings","264005478_The_List_Coloring_Reconfiguration_Problem_for_Bounded_Pathwidth_Graphs","262071298_Reconfiguration_in_bounded_bandwidth_and_treedepth","261289085_The_Complexity_of_Bounded_Length_Graph_Recoloring","220975960_Finding_Paths_Between_Graph_Colourings_PSPACE-Completeness_and_Superpolynomial_Distances","220570220_Linear_Time_Modular_Decomposition_of_Directed_Graphs","220442384_The_splittance_of_a_graph","220430895_Smallest-Last_Ordering_and_clustering_and_Graph_Coloring_Algorithms","220152460_On_the_Complexity_of_Reconfiguration_Problems","220148982_Finding_Paths_between_graph_colourings_PSPACE-completeness_and_superpolynomial_distances"]}
