{"id":"319649614_Some_More_New_Properties_of_Consecutive_Odd_Numbers","abstract":"The article proves several new properties of consecutive odd integers. The proved properties reveal divisors’ transition by subtracting two terms of an odd sequence, divisors’ stationary with adding or subtracting an item to the terms and pseudo-symmetric distribution of a divisor’s power in an odd sequence. The new properties are helpful for finding a divisor of an odd composite number in an odd sequence.","authors":["Xingbo Wang"],"meta":["September 2017Journal of Mathematics Research 9(5):61","DOI:10.5539/jmr.v9n5p61","Project: rsa factorization"],"references":["317193636_Two_More_Symmetric_Properties_of_Odd_Numbers","314954446_Genetic_Traits_of_Odd_Numbers_with_Applications_in_Factorization_of_Integers","311761879_Amusing_Properties_of_Odd_Numbers_Derived_From_Valuated_Binary_Tree","309426950_Seed_and_Sieve_of_Odd_Composite_Numbers_with_Applications_in_Factorization_of_Integers","302589769_Valuated_Binary_Tree_A_New_Approach_in_Study_of_Integers","295351382_New_Constructive_Approach_to_Solve_Problems_of_Integers'_Divisibility","265231681_An_Overview_of_Cryptography","324409411_Elementary_Number_Theory_and_Its_Applications","268637326_History_of_the_theory_of_numbers_I_II_III"]}
