{"id":"272422850_A_Comprehensive_Survey_on_Pose-Invariant_Face_Recognition","abstract":"The capacity to recognize faces under varied poses is a fundamental human ability that presents a unique challenge for computer vision systems. Compared to frontal face recognition, which has been intensively studied and has gradually matured in the past few decades, Pose-Invariant Face Recognition (PIFR) remains a largely unsolved problem. However, PIFR is crucial to realizing the full potential of face recognition for real-world applications, since face recognition is intrinsically a passive biometric technology for recognizing uncooperative subjects. In this article, we discuss the inherent difficulties in PIFR and present a comprehensive review of established techniques. Existing PIFR methods can be grouped into four categories, that is, pose-robust feature extraction approaches, multiview subspace learning approaches, face synthesis approaches, and hybrid approaches. The motivations, strategies, pros/cons, and performance of representative approaches are described and compared. Moreover, promising directions for future research are discussed.","authors":["Changxing Ding","Dacheng Tao"],"meta":["March 2016ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology 7(3):37:1-37:42","DOI:10.1145/2845089","SourcearXiv"],"references":["319877813_Face_Recognition_by_Elastic_Bunch_Graph_Matching","283865383_Report_on_the_FG_2015_Video_Person_Recognition_Evaluation","281487308_Robust_Face_Recognition_via_Multimodal_Deep_Face_Representation","279840227_Learning_invariant_representations_and_applications_to_face_verification","277411157_Deep_Learning","274069473_Fast_Robust_and_Automatic_3D_Face_Model_Reconstruction_from_Videos","269116584_Deeply_learned_face_representations_are_sparse_selective_and_robust","268988352_Classification_with_Noisy_Labels_by_Importance_Reweighting","265787774_A_Survey_on_Heterogeneous_Face_Recognition_Sketch_Infra-red_3D_and_Low-resolution","265493403_Pose_Normalization_via_Learned_2D_Warping_for_Fully_Automatic_Face_Recognition","320112472_Face_recognition_by_Elastic_Bunch_Graph_Matching","316240097_Distinctive_Image_Features_from_Scale-Invariant_Keypoints","314405613_Textural_Hausdorff_Distance_for_wider-range_tolerance_to_pose_variation_and_misalignment_in_2D_face_recognition","314405497_3D_morphable_face_models_revisited","313181023_Distinctive_image_features_from_scale-invariant_keypoints","312471343_Facewarehouse_A_3d_facial_expression_database_for_visual_computing","310842463_Tied_factor_analysis_for_face_recognition_across_large_pose_differences","310440789_Maximizing_intra-individual_correlations_for_face_recognition_across_pose_differences","308834606_High-fidelity_Pose_and_Expression_Normalization_for_face_recognition_in_the_wild","308825685_Web-scale_training_for_face_identification","308812843_Rotating_your_face_using_multi-task_deep_neural_network","304555079_Hierarchical-PEP_model_for_real-world_face_recognition","304552788_FaceNet_A_unified_embedding_for_face_recognition_and_clustering","304469237_Global_supervised_descent_method","291154059_Principal_warps_Thin-plate_splines_and_the_decomposition_of_deformations","289593486_Multi-view_perceptron_A_deep_model_for_learning_face_identity_and_view_representations","286594474_3D-Aided_Face_Recognition_Robust_to_Expression_and_Pose_Variations","286295044_Robust_face_recognition_by_an_albedo_based_3D_morphable_model","286016734_Stacked_Progressive_Auto-Encoders_SPAE_for_Face_Recognition_Across_Poses","285599593_A_Global_Geometric_Framework_for_Nonlinear_Dimensionality_Reduction","280287121_MiLDA_A_graph_embedding_approach_to_multi-view_face_recognition","277637429_Multi-View_Intact_Space_Learning","274417336_Polishing_Silicon_Wafers_with_the_Nanodiamond_Abrasive_Tools_Prepared_by_Sol-Gel_Technique","273699841_High-Resolution_Face_Verification_Using_Pore-Scale_Facial_Features","273475122_Class-Specific_Kernel_Fusion_of_Multiple_Descriptors_for_Face_Verification_Using_Multiscale_Binarised_Statistical_Image_Features","273471270_FaceNet_A_Unified_Embedding_for_Face_Recognition_and_Clustering","273394300_Reference_Face_Graph_for_Face_Recognition","273303098_Real-World_and_Rapid_Face_Recognition_Toward_Pose_and_Expression_Variations_via_Feature_Library_Matrix","272132116_A_3D-Based_Pose_Invariant_Face_Recognition_at_a_Distance_Framework","270962355_Multi-Task_Pose-Invariant_Face_Recognition","270455450_A_Unified_Regularization_Framework_for_Virtual_Frontal_Face_Image_Synthesis","269250424_Fisher_Vector_Faces_in_the_Wild","268988129_Effective_Face_Frontalization_in_Unconstrained_Images","268586716_Resolution-Aware_3D_Morphable_Model","266563101_Single-view-based_3D_facial_reconstruction_method_robust_against_pose_variations","266560944_Facial_Feature_Point_Detection_A_Comprehensive_Survey","266341964_Tom-vs-Pete_Classifiers_and_Identity-Preserving_Alignment_for_Face_Verification","265210834_Sparse_Feature_Extractionfor_Pose-Tolerant_Face_Recognition","265094552_Maximal_Likelihood_Correspondence_Estimation_for_Face_Recognition_Across_Pose","265052830_Fast_pose_invariant_face_recognition_using_super_coupled_multiresolution_Markov_Random_Fields_on_a_GPU","265051004_Unconstrained_Face_Recognition_Identifying_a_Person_of_Interest_From_a_Media_Collection","263697736_Unconstrained_Face_Recognition_Identifying_a_Person_of_Interest_from_a_Media_Collection","263789470_Face_recognition_from_video_A_review","263564119_DeepFace_Closing_the_Gap_to_Human-Level_Performance_in_Face_Verification","263316209_Web-Scale_Training_for_Face_Identification"]}
