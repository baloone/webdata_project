{"id":"307144398_Implementing_a_Learning_Analytics_Intervention_and_Evaluation_Framework_What_Works","abstract":"Substantial progress in learning analytics research has been made in recent years to predict which groups of learners are at risk. In this chapter, we argue that the largest challenge for learning analytics research and practice still lies ahead of us: using learning analytics modelling, which types of interventions have a positive impact on learners’ Attitudes, Behaviour and Cognition (ABC). Two embedded case-studies in social science and science are discussed, whereby notions of evidence-based research are illustrated by scenarios (quasi-experimental, A/B-testing, RCT) to evaluate the impact of interventions. Finally, we discuss how a Learning Analytics Intervention and Evaluation Framework (LA-IEF) is currently being implemented at the Open University UK using principles of design-based research and evidence-based research.","authors":["Bart Rienties","Simon Cross","Zdenek Zdráhal"],"meta":["January 2017","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-06520-5_10","In book: Big Data and Learning Analytics in Higher Education (pp.147-166)"],"references":["308067314_Enhancing_teaching_and_learning_through_educational_data_mining_and_learning_analytics_An_issue_brief","286689963_Analytics_for_Education","286579430_Developing_predictive_models_for_early_detection_of_at-risk_students_on_distance_learning_modules","281156320_Examining_a_multidimensional_model_of_student_motivation_and_engagement_using_a_construct_validation_approach","280091492_Challenging_the_'distance_education_deficit'_through_'motivational_emails'","279597273_Opening_Learning_Management_Systems_to_Personal_Learning_Environments","279190719_Scaling_up_learning_design_impact_of_learning_design_activities_on_LMS_behavior_and_performance_Conference_Item_Scaling_up_learning_design_impact_of_learning_design_activities_on_LMS_behavior_and_perf","323242775_Breakthrough_Leadership_in_the_Digital_Age_Using_Learning_Science_to_Reboot_Schooling","312085950_Designing_randomised_trials_in_health_education_and_the_social_sciences_An_introduction","286866390_Data_mining"]}
