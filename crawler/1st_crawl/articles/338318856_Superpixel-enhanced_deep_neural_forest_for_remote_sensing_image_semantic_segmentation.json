{"id":"338318856_Superpixel-enhanced_deep_neural_forest_for_remote_sensing_image_semantic_segmentation","abstract":"Semantic segmentation plays an important role in remote sensing image understanding. Great progress has been made in this area with the development of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs). However, due to the complexity of ground objectsâ€™ spectrum, DCNNs with simple classifier have difficulties in distinguishing ground object categories even though they can represent image features effectively. Additionally, DCNN-based semantic segmentation methods learn to accumulate contextual information over large receptive fields that causes blur on object boundaries. In this work, a novel approach named Superpixel-enhanced Deep Neural Forest (SDNF) is proposed to target the aforementioned problems. To improve the classification ability, we introduce Deep Neural Forest (DNF), where the representation learning of deep neural network is conducted by a completely differentiable decision forest. Therefore, better classification accuracy is achieved by combining DCNNs with decision forests in an end-to-end manner. In addition, considering the homogeneity within superpixels and heterogeneity between superpixels, a Superpixel-enhanced Region Module (SRM) is proposed to further alleviate the noises and strengthen edges of ground objects. Experimental results on the ISPRS 2D semantic labeling benchmark demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods thus validate the efficiency of our proposed SDNF.","authors":["Li Mi","Zhenzhong Chen"],"meta":["January 2020ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing 159:140-152","DOI:10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2019.11.006"],"references":["344601510_Semantic_Segmentation_of_Aerial_Images_With_Shuffling_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","329750384_Learning_Superpixels_with_Segmentation-Aware_Affinity_Loss","327796689_Very_high_resolution_remote_sensing_image_classification_with_SEEDS-CNN_and_scale_effect_analysis_for_superpixel_CNN_classification","327521314_Supervised_Classification_of_Multisensor_Remotely_Sensed_Images_Using_a_Deep_Learning_Framework","323273293_Land_cover_mapping_at_very_high_resolution_with_rotation_equivariant_CNNs_Towards_small_yet_accurate_models","322749812_SegNet_A_Deep_Convolutional_Encoder-Decoder_Architecture_for_Image_Segmentation","321970661_Semantic_Labeling_in_Very_High_Resolution_Images_via_a_Self-Cascaded_Convolutional_Neural_Network_ISPRS_JPRS_IF6942","321258371_Beyond_RGB_Very_High_Resolution_Urban_Remote_Sensing_With_Multimodal_Deep_Networks","319859209_Optimal_Segmentation_of_High-Resolution_Remote_Sensing_Image_by_Combining_Superpixels_With_the_Minimum_Spanning_Tree","319468668_Contextually_guided_very-high-resolution_imagery_classification_with_semantic_segments","319285035_Dense_Semantic_Labeling_of_Very-High-Resolution_Aerial_Imagery_and_LiDAR_with_Fully-Convolutional_Neural_Networks_and_Higher-Order_CRFs","315768062_Object-Based_Convolutional_Neural_Network_for_High-Resolution_Imagery_Classification","314523089_Semantic_Segmentation_of_Earth_Observation_Data_Using_Multimodal_and_Multi-scale_Deep_Networks","311458441_Superpixels_An_Evaluation_of_the_State-of-the-Art","311201659_Classification_With_an_Edge_Improving_Semantic_Image_Segmentation_with_Boundary_Detection","305779573_Dense_Semantic_Labeling_of_Subdecimeter_Resolution_Images_With_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","300412490_Deep_Neural_Decision_Forests","3203836_Supervised_segmentation_of_remote_sensing_images_based_on_a_tree-structured_MRF_model","336185044_TreeUNet_Adaptive_Tree_convolutional_neural_networks_for_subdecimeter_aerial_image_segmentation","333586467_Dynamic_Multicontext_Segmentation_of_Remote_Sensing_Images_Based_on_Convolutional_Networks","329014827_Problems_of_Encoder-Decoder_Frameworks_for_High-Resolution_Remote_Sensing_Image_Segmentation_Structural_Stereotype_and_Insufficient_Learning","325863202_Recurrent_Multiresolution_Convolutional_Networks_for_VHR_Image_Classification","324857691_Algorithms_for_semantic_segmentation_of_multispectral_remote_sensing_imagery_using_deep_learning","324495563_VPRS-Based_Regional_Decision_Fusion_of_CNN_and_MRF_Classifications_for_Very_Fine_Resolution_Remotely_Sensed_Images","324143397_Multi-class_geospatial_object_detection_based_on_a_position-sensitive_balancing_framework_for_high_spatial_resolution_remote_sensing_imagery","324055271_Low-Shot_Learning_for_the_Semantic_Segmentation_of_Remote_Sensing_Imagery","324045330_Symmetrical_Dense-Shortcut_Deep_Fully_Convolutional_Networks_for_Semantic_Segmentation_of_Very-High-Resolution_Remote_Sensing_Images","323766895_High-Resolution_Remote_Sensing_Image_Classification_Using_Associative_Hierarchical_CRF_Considering_Segmentation_Quality","323526523_Integrating_fuzzy_object_based_image_analysis_and_ant_colony_optimization_for_road_extraction_from_remotely_sensed_images","320968206_Pyramid_Scene_Parsing_Network","320964667_Superpixels_and_Polygons_Using_Simple_Non-iterative_Clustering","319770168_Fully_Convolutional_Networks_for_Semantic_Segmentation","319438144_High-Resolution_Aerial_Image_Labeling_With_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","311611364_Attention_to_Scale_Scale-Aware_Semantic_Image_Segmentation","308847282_Effective_semantic_pixel_labelling_with_convolutional_networks_and_Conditional_Random_Fields","305193694_U-Net_Convolutional_Networks_for_Biomedical_Image_Segmentation","305037084_Multiscale_and_Multifeature_Normalized_Cut_Segmentation_for_High_Spatial_Resolution_Remote_Sensing_Imagery","303812083_DeepLab_Semantic_Image_Segmentation_with_Deep_Convolutional_Nets_Atrous_Convolution_and_Fully_Connected_CRFs","294577401_Random_forest_in_remote_sensing_A_review_of_applications_and_future_directions","265388937_Structured_Labels_in_Random_Forests_for_Semantic_Labelling_and_Object_Detection","221364450_Entropy_rate_superpixel_segmentation","4038368_Learning_a_classification_model_for_segmentation"]}
