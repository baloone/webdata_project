{"id":"344584679_Global_sensitivity_based_estimability_analysis_for_the_parameter_identification_of_Pitzer's_thermodynamic_model","abstract":"This paper deals with parameter estimability analysis and identification of the Pitzer model used in the predictionof thermodynamic properties and phase equilibria of electrolytic solutions. The estimability analysis method used isbased on the orthogonalization of a sensitivity matrix to rank the unknown parameters from the most estimable tothe least estimable. Although the obtained results are interesting, the algorithm shows its limits since it is basedon the local sensitivities of the outputs with respect to the unknown parameters of the model and may significantlyaffect the reliability of the model. In this work, the algorithm is improved by computing the sensitivities by means ofthe method of global sensitivity analysis. For demonstration purposes, different sets of experimental measurements ofsulfuric acid solutions are carried out at different temperatures and acid concentrations. They mainly consist of pH,density, conductivity and molality measurements. The improved algorithm is then applied to each of the experimentalsets. The most estimable parameters are determined and identified using a branch-and-reduce optimization method andtheir accuracy is assessed by means of confidence intervals. Finally, the quality of the model is quantified by computingthe Pearson product-moment coefficient, its high values show a very good agreement between the predictions and themeasurements","authors":["Ilias Bouchkira","Abderrazak M.
