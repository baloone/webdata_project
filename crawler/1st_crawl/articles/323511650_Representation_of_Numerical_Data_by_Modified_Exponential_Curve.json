{"id":"323511650_Representation_of_Numerical_Data_by_Modified_Exponential_Curve","abstract":"It is possible to represent the numerical data on a pair of variables by non-polynomial curve besides the representation of said numerical data by polynomial curve for which several methods have already been developed. In this study, attempt has been made on the representation of numerical data on a pair of variables by a special non-polynomial curve namely modified exponential curve. This paper describes the method of representing numerical data on a pair of variables by modified exponential curve with numerical example in order to show the application of the method to numerical data.","authors":["Dhritikesh Chakrabarty"],"meta":["August 2017","Project: Ph.D. Research"],"references":["332495523_Effects_of_Unsteady_Free_Convective_MHD_Non-Newtonian_Flow_Through_a_Porous_Medium_Bounded_by_an_Infinite_Inclined_Porous_Plate","293158096_Choice-based_credit_system_boon_or_bane","285731458_MHD_double_diffusive_and_chemical_reactive_flow_through_porous_medium_bounded_by_two_vertical_plates","281582132_Radiation_and_Mass_Transfer_Effects_on_a_Free_Convection_Flow_through_A_Porous_Medium_Bounded_by_a_Vertical_Surface","280447015_Optimal_sizing_of_a_hydrogen-based_windPV_plant_considering_reliability_indices","313182251_Unit_sizing_and_control_of_hybrid_wind-solar_power_systems","313062410_Heat_and_mass_transfer_effects_on_moving_vertical_plate_in_the_presence_of_thermal_radiation","307466142_An_assesment_of_biofuel_use_and_burning_of_agricultural_waste_in_the_developing_world_Global_Biogeochem","284553154_Effects_of_the_chemical_reaction_and_mass_transfer_on_MHD_unsteady_free_convection_flow_past_an_infinite_vertical_plate_with_constant_suction_and_heat_sink","281391809_Pre-feasibility_analysis_of_solar-wind_hybrid_system_potential_in_a_complex_hilly_terrain"]}
