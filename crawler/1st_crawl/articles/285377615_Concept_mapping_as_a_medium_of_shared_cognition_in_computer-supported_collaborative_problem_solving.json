{"id":"285377615_Concept_mapping_as_a_medium_of_shared_cognition_in_computer-supported_collaborative_problem_solving","abstract":"This article presents an experimental study aimed at investigating\nthe learning effectiveness of concept mapping for\ncomputer-supported collaborative problem solving. The main\nassumption underlying this research is that shared cognition\nis substantial for cognitive construction and reconstruction\nand that concept mapping is an effective tool for mediating\ncomputer-supported collaboration.\nThree scenarios for “mediated group interaction” by concept\nmapping have been designed—distributed, moderated, and\nshared. They are based on the assumption that the form in\nwhich knowledge is shared strongly influences the process of\nshaping, and shared cognition subsequently influences the\neffectiveness of collaborative learning. These three scenarios\ndemonstrated differential effects towards various aspects of\nlearning effectiveness both at the group and at the individual\nlevel. It is concluded that both the mode of sharing and the\nrepresentation of knowledge as expressed by students are\nmore important than the access to the distributed resources\nitself. The sharing scenarios showed to be most appropriate\nfor establishing a supportive learning environment.","authors":["N.
