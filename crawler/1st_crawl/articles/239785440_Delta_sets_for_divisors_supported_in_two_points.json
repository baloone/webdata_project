{"id":"239785440_Delta_sets_for_divisors_supported_in_two_points","abstract":"In (8), the authors formulate new coset bounds for algebraic geometric codes. The bounds give improved lower bounds for the minumum distance of algebraic geometric codes as well as improved thresholds for algebraic geometric linear secret sharing schemes. The coset bounds depend on the choice of a sequence of divisors and on its intersection with a given set of divisors called a delta set. In this paper, we give general properties of delta sets and we analyze sequences of divisors supported in two points on Hermitian and Suzuki curves.","authors":["Iwan M.
