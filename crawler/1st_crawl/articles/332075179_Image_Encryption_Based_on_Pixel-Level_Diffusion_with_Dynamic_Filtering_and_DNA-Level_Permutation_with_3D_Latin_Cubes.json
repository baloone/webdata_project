{"id":"332075179_Image_Encryption_Based_on_Pixel-Level_Diffusion_with_Dynamic_Filtering_and_DNA-Level_Permutation_with_3D_Latin_Cubes","abstract":"Image encryption is one of the essential tasks in image security. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that integrates a hyperchaotic system, pixel-level Dynamic Filtering, DNA computing, and operations on 3D Latin Cubes, namely DFDLC, for image encryption. Specifically, the approach consists of five stages: (1) a newly proposed 5D hyperchaotic system with two positive Lyapunov exponents is applied to generate a pseudorandom sequence; (2) for each pixel in an image, a filtering operation with different templates called dynamic filtering is conducted to diffuse the image; (3) DNA encoding is applied to the diffused image and then the DNA-level image is transformed into several 3D DNA-level cubes; (4) Latin cube is operated on each DNA-level cube; and (5) all the DNA cubes are integrated and decoded to a 2D cipher image. Extensive experiments are conducted on public testing images, and the results show that the proposed DFDLC can achieve state-of-the-art results in terms of several evaluation criteria.","authors":["Taiyong Li","Jiayi Shi","Xinsheng Li","Jiang Wu"],"meta":["March 2019Entropy 21(3):319","DOI:10.3390/e21030319"],"references":["331677080_Implementing_a_Chaotic_Cryptosystem_by_Performing_Parallel_Computing_on_Embedded_Systems_with_Multiprocessors","331046545_Implementing_a_chaotic_cryptosystem_in_a_64-bit_embedded_system_by_using_multiple-precision_arithmetic","330921200_On_the_synchronization_techniques_of_chaotic_oscillators_and_their_FPGA-based_implementation_for_secure_image_transmission","330853265_A_CEEMDAN_and_XGBOOST-Based_Approach_to_Forecast_Crude_Oil_Prices","330844032_Image_Encryption_Based_on_Dynamic_Filtering_and_Bit_Cuboid_Operations","330078270_Image_Encryption_Using_Josephus_Problem_and_Filtering_Diffusion","328844021_Block-Based_Optical_Color_Image_Encryption_Based_on_Double_Random_Phase_Encoding","330799636_Silhouette-free_interference-based_multiple-image_encryption_using_cascaded_fractional_Fourier_transforms","330501589_Joint_medical_image_compression-encryption_in_the_cloud_using_multiscale_transform-based_image_compression_encoding_techniques","329952114_Quantum_Image_Encryption_Using_Intra_and_Inter_Bit_Permutation_Based_on_Logistic_Map"]}
