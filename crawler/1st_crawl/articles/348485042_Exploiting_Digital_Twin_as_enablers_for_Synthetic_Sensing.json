{"id":"348485042_Exploiting_Digital_Twin_as_enablers_for_Synthetic_Sensing","abstract":"The Digital Twin has the ability to store historical and current data about the physical object. In IoT, the concept of general-purpose sensing is aiming at determining a set of basic sensing capabilities from which deriving, by means of Artificial Intelligence algorithms and techniques (termed Synthetic Sensing), relevant information for describing an environment. This paper explores the possible relationships and the feasibility of integration of Synthetic Sensing within a Digital Twin framework. The relevant concepts and associated technologies, the challenges, and some of the enabled scenarios that this integration can bring are presented. This approach is in its infancy and there is a strong need to validate and assess its viability, feasibility, and benefits. The paper identifies some challenges and validation steps that can lead to consolidation and broad adoption of this approach. Finally, the paper presents some future work that aiming at proving the approach","authors":["Roberto Minerva","Faraz Malik Awan","Noel Crespi"],"meta":["January 2021IEEE Internet Computing PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/MIC.2021.3051674"],"references":["345253375_Sample_Based_Synthesis_of_Car_Engine_Noise","342115526_A_Digital_Twin_for_Operational_Evaluation_of_Vertical_Transportation_Systems","339914802_Explaining_Black_Box_Models_Through_Twin_Systems","338184751_Explainable_Artificial_Intelligence_XAI_Concepts_Taxonomies_Opportunities_and_Challenges_toward_Responsible_AI","337363063_A_state-of-the-art_survey_of_Digital_Twin_techniques_engineering_product_lifecycle_management_and_business_innovation_perspectives","331742851_Smart_City_Platform_Enabling_Digital_Twin","343147931_Towards_Evolving_Symbiotic_Cognitive_Education_Based_on_Digital_Twins","342287143_Digital_Twin_in_the_IoT_Context_A_Survey_on_Technical_Features_Scenarios_and_Architectural_Models","335197643_Cardio_Twin_A_Digital_Twin_of_the_human_heart_running_on_the_edge","329397405_A_Survey_on_Data_Fusion_in_Internet_of_Things_Towards_Secure_and_Privacy-Preserving_Fusion"]}
