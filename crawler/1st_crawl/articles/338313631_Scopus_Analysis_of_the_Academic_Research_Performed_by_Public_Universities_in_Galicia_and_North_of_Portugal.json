{"id":"338313631_Scopus_Analysis_of_the_Academic_Research_Performed_by_Public_Universities_in_Galicia_and_North_of_Portugal","abstract":"Scopus is recognized by experts as one of the best, most rigorous, and most complete bibliometric databases. The present work used Scopus-based bibliometric analysis and Pearson correlation coefficients to analyse the research output of three universities in the Galicia region of Spain and three public universities of North of Portugal. The purpose of this study was to understand the current state of Galician and Northern Portugal academic and scientific research, to identify the main research fields in which the region stands out, and to compare and contrast the academic production of the six universities. The main conclusion to be drawn from this study is that scientific production in the Euroregion Galicia-North of Portugal is not concentrated on a few study fields, but covers a wide range of subjects, from medicine and chemistry, to computer science or engineering. The University of Porto stands out, both in scientific production and in the number of researchers.","authors":["Noelia Araújo","José Antonio Fraiz Brea","Lucília Cardoso","Alexandra Matos Pereira"],"meta":["January 2020Information Resources Management Journal 33(1):16-38","DOI:10.4018/IRMJ.2020010102"],"references":["290622858_The_museum_of_errorshorrors_in_Scopus","272814986_What_Drives_Academic_Data_Sharing","272119058_Australian_Education_Journals_Quantitative_and_Qualitative_Indicators","260520938_Assessment_of_research_fields_in_Scopus_and_Web_of_Science_in_the_view_of_national_research_evaluation_in_Slovenia","345828014_Misunderstanding_the_Internet","317197359_Organizational_Research_in_the_Field_of_Green_IT_A_Systematic_Literature_Review_from_2007_to_2016","286114299_Use_of_internet_for_academic_purposes_among_students_in_Malaysian_institutions_of_higher_education","271635175_Finding_Citations_to_Social_Work_Literature_The_Relative_Benefits_of_Using_Web_of_Science_Scopus_or_Google_Scholar","269177952_The_measure_of_research_merit","263327302_Public_ICT_Innovations_A_Strategic_Ambiguity_Perspective"]}
