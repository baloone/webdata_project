{"id":"261660522_The_Role_of_Dialogue_in_Providing_Scaffolded_Instruction","abstract":"The acquisition and refinement of cognitive strategies are described as a collaborative effort between teachers and students that is facilitated by scaffolded instruction. Although dialogue does not currently have a preeminent role in our classrooms, it can promote the kinds of opportunities necessary for the teacher to provide scaffolded instruction. To support and illustrate this point, a program of research investigating the use of dialogue to teach comprehension strategies is reviewed with particular attention to its extension to first-grade students at risk for academic difficulty. Transcripts from this research are presented to capture the quality of dialogue that fosters scaffolded instruction.","authors":["Annemarie Palincsar"],"meta":["June 2011Educational Psychologist 21(1):73-98","DOI:10.1080/00461520.1986.9653025"],"references":["231900899_The_Achievement_and_Antecedents_of_Labeling","200772570_Reciprocal_teaching_of_comprehension-fostering_and_monitoring_activities","49176154_Inducing_strategic_learning_from_texts_by_means_of_informed_self-control_training","250055181_The_Relationship_between_Explicit_Verbal_Explanations_during_Reading_Skill_Instruction_and_Student_Awareness_and_Achievement_A_Study_of_Reading_Teacher_Effects","243771532_Metacognitive_skills_and_reading","242375185_Qualitative_Research_For_Education_An_Introduction_To_Theory_and_Methods","234666488_Instructional_Scaffolding_Reading_and_Writing_as_Natural_Language_Activities","232590565_Adjustment_of_Adult-Child_Instruction_According_to_Child's_Age_and_Task","232535407_Oral_Discussion_Group-to-Individual_Transfer_and_Achievement_in_Cooperative_Learning_Groups","232530691_Everyday_Cognition_Its_Development_in_Social_Context","232505274_The_zone_of_proximal_development_Some_conceptual_issues","232421717_From_Social_Interaction_to_Higher_Psychological_Processes","232418777_The_significance_of_dialogue_in_Vygotsky's_account_of_social_egocentric_and_inner_speech","220041424_Mind_in_Society_The_Development_of_Higher_Psychological_Functions","48132635_Analyzing_Teaching_Behavior","35952720_Improving_the_reading_comprehension_of_junior_high_students_through_the_reciprocal_teaching_of_comprehension-monitoring_strategies","22223090_The_role_of_tutoring_in_problem_solving","16465308_The_Use_and_Effectiveness_of_Maternal_Scaffolding_in_Mother-Infant_Games"]}
