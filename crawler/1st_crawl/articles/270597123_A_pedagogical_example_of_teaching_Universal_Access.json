{"id":"270597123_A_pedagogical_example_of_teaching_Universal_Access","abstract":"Designing for Universal Access requires designers to have a good understanding of the full range of users and their capabilities, appropriate datasets, and the most suitable tools and techniques. Education clearly plays an important role in helping designers acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to find the relevant information about the users and then apply it to produce a genuinely inclusive design. This paper presents a reflective analysis of a variant of the “Usability and Accessibility” course for MSc students, developed and delivered by the author over five successive semesters at the IT University of Copenhagen. The aim is to examine whether this course provided an effective and useful method for raising the issues around Universal Access with the designers of the future. This paper examines the results and conclusions from the students over five semesters of this course and provides an overview of the success of the different design and evaluation methods. The paper concludes with a discussion of the effectiveness of each of the specific methods, techniques and tools used in the course, both from design and education perspectives.","authors":["Simeon Keates"],"meta":["January 2015Universal Access in the Information Society 14(1)","DOI:10.1007/s10209-014-0398-4"],"references":["270723895_Universal_Design_of_Consumer_Products_Current_Industry_Practice_and_Perceptions","234800426_Countering_design_exclusion_through_inclusive_design","228609614_User_sensitive_inclusive_design_-_In_search_of_a_new_paradigm","319260872_The_Universal_Access_Handbook","288987228_Playing_your_cards_right","269034273_A_survey_of_user-centered_design_practice","265926067_Quantifying_Design_Exclusion","242325619_eds_inclusive_design_design_for_the_whole_population","235700980_The_Essential_Persona_Lifecycle_Your_Guide_to_Building_and_Using_Personas","220933699_WebAnywhere_A_Screen_Reader_On-the-Go","220756807_The_Inmates_Are_Running_the_Asylum","220691659_Usability_Engineering","220606723_Cognitive_and_learning_difficulties_and_how_they_affect_access_to_IT_systems","220382906_Playing_your_cards_right_getting_the_most_from_card_sorting_for_navigation_design","220382861_Universal_Ubiquitous_User-Interface_Design_for_the_Disabled_and_Elderly","200553086_A_Survey_of_User-Centered_Design_Practice","200086043_Usability_Inspection_Methods","200027414_Web_Accessibility_Web_Standards_and_Regulatory_Compliance","12362278_Universal_access_to_health"]}
