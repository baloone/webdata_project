{"id":"222135969_Some_Probabilistic_Models_of_Simple_Choice_and_Ranking","abstract":"A simple choice experiment is one in which a subject is asked to select among several alternatives according to some specified criterion, and a ranking experiment is one in which he is asked to rank order the alternatives, again according to some specified criterion. When decisions are governed by a probabilistic process, various connections are possible between simple choice and ranking behavior. In this paper we consider a set of conditions that assumes that the ranking probabilities can be expressed as a “natural” function of the simple choice probabilities. Under these conditions the binary choice probabilities on a finite set A determine the simple choice and ranking probabilities on every subset of A, and explicit forms are given for the functions relating the simple choice and ranking probabilities to the binary choice probabilities.","authors":["A.
