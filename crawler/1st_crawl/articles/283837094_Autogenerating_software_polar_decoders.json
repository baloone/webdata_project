{"id":"283837094_Autogenerating_software_polar_decoders","abstract":"Polar decoders are well suited for high-speed software implementations. In this work, we present a framework for generating fully-unrolled software polar decoders with branchless data flow. We discuss the memory layout of data in these decoders and show the optimization techniques used. At 335 Mbps, when decoding a (2048, 1707) polar code, the resulting decoder has more than twice the speed of the state of the art floating-point software polar decoder.","authors":["Gabi Sarkis","Pascal Giard","C.
