The pedagogies involved, however, remain under-researched and the pedagogical culture under-developed. This paper builds upon recent thematic reviews of the literature to report new research that shifts the focus from individual experiences of research methods teaching to empirical evidence from a study crossing research methods, disciplines and nations. A dialogic, expert panel method was used, engaging international experts to examine teaching and learning practices in advanced social research methods. Expertsâ€™ perspectives demonstrated strong thematic commonalities across quantitative, qualitative and mixed methods domains in terms of pedagogy, by connecting learners to research, giving direct and immersive experiences of research practice and promoting reflexivity. This paper argues that through analysis of expert responses to the distinct pedagogic challenges of the methods classroom, the principles and illustrative examples generated can form the knowledge and understanding required to enhance pedagogic culture and practice.","authors":["Sarah Lewthwaite","Melanie Nind"],"meta":["June 2016British Journal of Educational Studies 64(4):1-18","DOI:10.1080/00071005.2016.1197882","Project: Pedagogy of Methodological Learning Project"],"references":["296282792_Pedagogic_Leadership_creating_cultures_and_practices_for_outstanding_vocational_learning","285651790_Challenges_to_teaching_mixed_research_courses","283172815_The_CAQDAS_Postgraduate_Learning_Model_an_interplay_between_methodological_awareness_analytic_adeptness_and_technological_proficiency","347796256_Teaching_Qualitative_Research_Cases_and_Issues","313875019_Teaching_mixed_methods_research_Practice_dilemmas_and_challenges","299448666_The_teaching_of_research_methods_fostering_discursive_pedagogic_spaces_in_capacity_building","289272753_Teaching_Qualitative_Methods_in_Social_Science_A_Problem-based_Learning_Approach","287254026_Teaching_research_methods_in_the_social_sciences","282271095_The_problems_and_prospects_in_the_teaching_of_mixed_methods_research","282054835_The_teaching_and_learning_of_social_research_methods_developments_in_pedagogical_knowledge"]}
