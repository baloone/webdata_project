{"id":"334897437_Prediction_of_Student's_performance_by_modelling_small_dataset_size","abstract":"Prediction of student’s performance became an urgent desire in most of educational entities and institutes. That is essential in order to help at-risk students and assure their retention, providing the excellent learning resources and experience, and improving the university’s ranking and reputation. However, that might be difficult to be achieved for startup to mid-sized universities, especially those which are specialized in graduate and post graduate programs, and have small students’ records for analysis. So, the main aim of this project is to prove the possibility of training and modeling a small dataset size and the feasibility of creating a prediction model with credible accuracy rate. This research explores as well the possibility of identifying the key indicators in the small dataset, which will be utilized in creating the prediction model, using visualization and clustering algorithms. Best indicators were fed into multiple machine learning algorithms to evaluate them for the most accurate model. Among the selected algorithms, the results proved the ability of clustering algorithm in identifying key indicators in small datasets. The main outcomes of this study have proved the efficiency of support vector machine and learning discriminant analysis algorithms in training small dataset size and in producing an acceptable classification’s accuracy and reliability test rates.\n\nJournal name : International Journal of Educational Technology in Higher Education (ISSN: 2365-9440)","authors":["Lubna Mahmoud Abu Zohair"],"meta":["December 2019","DOI:10.1186/s41239-019-0160-3"],"references":["317768552_A_comparative_review_of_dynamic_neural_networks_and_hidden_Markov_model_methods_for_mobile_on-device_speech_recognition","311068715_Modeling_and_Predicting_Students'_Academic_Performance_Using_Data_Mining_Techniques","305001704_Sentiment_Analysis_of_Review_Datasets_Using_Naive_Bayes'_and_K-NN_Classifier","263448802_Wind_Resource_Assessment_and_Forecast_Planning_with_Neural_Networks","317109378_Analyzing_undergraduate_students'_performance_using_educational_data_mining","310807613_An_educational_model_based_on_Knowledge_Discovery_in_Databases_KDD_to_predict_learner's_behavior_using_classification_techniques","310594617_The_Measurement_of_Interrater_Agreement_Statistical_Methods_for_Rates_and_Proportions","304620894_Building_Predictive_Models_in_R_Using_the_caret_Package","279065417_Artificial_neural_networks_for_small_dataset_analysis","271743382_Linear_discriminant_analysis_for_the_small_sample_size_problem_an_overview"]}
