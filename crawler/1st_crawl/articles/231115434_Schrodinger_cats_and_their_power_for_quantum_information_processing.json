{"id":"231115434_Schrodinger_cats_and_their_power_for_quantum_information_processing","abstract":"We outline a toolbox comprised of passive optical elements, single photon detection and superpositions of coherent states (Schr√∂dinger cat states). Such a toolbox is a powerful collection of primitives for quantum information processing tasks. We illustrate its use by outlining a proposal for universal quantum computation. We utilize this toolbox for quantum metrology applications, for instance weak force measurements and precise phase estimation. We show in both these cases that a sensitivity at the Heisenberg limit is achievable.","authors":["Alexei Gilchrist","Kae Nemoto","W J Munro","T C Ralph"],"meta":["July 2004Journal of Optics B Quantum and Semiclassical Optics 6(8):S828","DOI:10.1088/1464-4266/6/8/032","SourceOAI"],"references":["235552777_Improving_quantum_interferometry_by_using_entanglement","235481317_Generating_Schrodinger-cat-like_states_by_means_of_conditional_measurements_on_a_beam_splitter","234102632_Entangled-Photon_Virtual-State_Spectroscopy","37616739_Quantum_Computation_with_Coherent_States_Linear_Interactions_and_Superposed_Resources","316798812_Quantum_Optics","259059334_Quantum_Measurement","247063291_Optimal_frequency_measurements_with_maximally_correlated_state","245684939_Coherence_in_Spontaneous_Radiation_Processes","243478730_On_the_measurement_of_a_weak_classical_force_coupled_to_a_quantum-mechanical_oscillator_I_Issues_of_principle","200524403_Quantum_Computation_and_Quantum_Information"]}
