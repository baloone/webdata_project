{"id":"339336749_Editorial_on_Innovative_Network_Systems_and_Applications_together_with_the_Conference_on_Information_Systems_Innovations_for_Community_Services","abstract":"he purpose of this special issue is to assemble a selection of best research articles that were presented within the 6th International Conference on Innovative Network Systems and Applications (iNetSApp'18),1 which was organized under the Federated Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems 2018 (FedCSIS'18),2 which was held in the Polish city Poznań. According to the FedCSIS policy, 23% acceptance rate was kept in all regular paper submissions with the help of the well‐structured and experienced conference program committee. Since only the little amount of papers met the quality for the publication in this special issue, other selected best papers from the 18th International Conference on Innovations for Community Services (I4CS 2018),3 which was held in Žilina, Slovakia, were selected for the publication. For this special issue, only the papers with best review score were selected, thus the quality of the CPE series can be conserved.","authors":["Michal Hodon","Janusz Furtak","Günter Fahrnberger","Ali Ismail Awad"],"meta":["February 2020Concurrency and Computation Practice and Experience 32(13)","DOI:10.1002/cpe.5698"],"references":["333979564_Searching_source_code_fragments_using_incremental_clustering","333781692_Concept_of_temporal_data_retrieval_Undefined_value_management","331495007_Procedures_for_sensor_nodes_operation_in_the_secured_domain_Procedures_for_sensor_nodes_operate_in_the_secured_domain","331115273_Challenges_introduced_by_heterogeneous_devices_for_Wi-Fi-based_indoor_localization","333866917_Toward_a_knowledge_model_focusing_on_microservices_and_cloud_computing","332907528_Dynamic_social_network_analysis_A_novel_approach_using_agent-based_model_author-topic_model_and_pretopology","332272050_New_technologies_for_smart_cities_-_high-resolution_air_pollution_maps_based_on_intelligent_sensors","331435261_On_the_distribution_of_queue_length_in_ideal_links","331433072_Edge-enabled_IoT_gateway_criteria_selection_and_evaluation","331401426_Locating_and_accessing_large_datasets_using_Flower_Index_Approach","329964570_The_new_Multicast_Repair_M-REP_IP_fast_reroute_mechanism_Multicast_Repair_IP_Fast_Reroute_Mechanism","325573413_Concept_of_Temporal_Data_Retrieval_Undefined_Value_Management"]}
