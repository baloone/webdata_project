{"id":"343987575_A_Python_Script_for_Abstract_Dialectical_Frameworks","abstract":"We introduce a Python script for an easy and intuitive calculation of semantics of Abstract Dialectical Frameworks (ADFs) with arbitrary acceptance conditions. In addition, the script enables the evaluation of so-called single-node formulae with the help of Kleene's three-valued logic. The experimental results show that we achieve an enormous computational gain in this case.","authors":["Ringo Baumann","Maximilian Heinrich"],"meta":["August 2020","Conference: Systems and Algorithms for Formal Argumentation"],"references":["342521479_Timed_Abstract_Dialectical_Frameworks_A_Simple_Translation-Based_Approach","292187679_On_All_Strong_Kleene_Generalizations_of_Classical_Logic","285432624_On_the_acceptability_of_arguments_and_its_fundamental_role_in_nonmonotonic_reasoning_and_logic_programming"]}
