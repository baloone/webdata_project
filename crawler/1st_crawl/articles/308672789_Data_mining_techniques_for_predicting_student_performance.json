{"id":"308672789_Data_mining_techniques_for_predicting_student_performance","abstract":"Predicting student performances in order to prevent or take precautions against student failures or dropouts is very significant these days. Student failure and dropout is a major problem nowadays. There can be many factors influencing student dropouts. Data mining can be used as an effective method to identify and predict these dropouts. In this paper, a classification method for prediction is been discussed. Decision tree classifiers are used here and methods for solving the class imbalance problem is also discussed.","authors":["K.
