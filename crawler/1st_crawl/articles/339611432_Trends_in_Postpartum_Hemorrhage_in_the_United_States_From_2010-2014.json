Doi: 10.1213/ANE.0000000000004424) Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is a major contributor to maternal morbidity and mortality in the United States, and its occurrence has increased 27.5% from 1995-2004 due to higher rates of uterine atony. There has been a number of concerted efforts to improve PPH care protocols at institutional, state, and national levels. These investigators conducted their study to analyze the frequency, etiology, and maternal morbidity of recent PPH trends in the United States. The National Inpatient Sample was used to identify and study subjects with a PPH diagnosis.","authors":["Sharon C. Reale","S.R. Easter","X.
