{"id":"258345410_Quantum_algorithms_for_approximating_the_effective_resistances_of_electrical_networks","abstract":"We present two quantum algorithms for approximating the effective resistance\nbetween any two vertices in a weighted graph. Both of them have running time\npoly$(\\log{n},d,c,1/\\phi,1/\\epsilon)$, where $n$ is the number of vertices in\nthe graph, $d$ is the maximum degree of the graph, $c$ is the ratio of the\nmaximum edge weight to the minimum edge weight, $\\phi$ is the expansion of the\ngraph, and $\\epsilon$ is the relative error. In contrast, the best known\nclassical algorithm for this problem requires $\\Omega(m)$ time, where $m$ is\nthe number of edges in the graph. Furthermore, as by-products, our algorithms\nalso yield good approximations of electrical flows and electrical potentials\n(as quantum states) respectively, which might be of independent interest.","authors":["Guoming Wang"],"meta":["November 2013","SourcearXiv"],"references":["239761510_Span_Programs_for_Functions_with_Constant-Sized_1-certificates","235509487_Quantum_Walks_and_Electric_Networks","227140153_The_Electrical_Resistance_Of_A_Graph_Captures_Its_Commute_And_Cover_Times","47501513_Variable_time_amplitude_amplification_and_a_faster_quantum_algorithm_for_solving_systems_of_linear_equations","24268791_Fast_amplification_of_QMA","4109377_Quantum_speed-up_of_Markov_Chain_based_algorithms","2196275_Efficient_Quantum_Algorithms_for_Simulating_Sparse_Hamiltonians","2184426_Quantum_Amplitude_Amplification_and_Estimation","314819406_Adiabatic_quantum_state_generation_and_statistical_zero_knowledge","262331991_A_new_approach_to_computing_maximum_flows_using_electrical_flows","256097290_Exponential_improvement_in_precision_for_Hamiltonian-evolution_simulation","242396851_A_lower_bound_for_the_smallest_eigenvalue_of_the_Laplacian","233407299_Spectral_Graph_Theory","220138846_Quantum_measurements_and_the_Abelian_Stabilizer_Problem","47405386_Electrical_Flows_Laplacian_Systems_and_Faster_Approximation_of_Maximum_Flow_in_Undirected_Graphs","45907070_Simulating_Sparse_Hamiltonians_with_Star_Decompositions","45879802_Black-box_Hamiltonian_simulation_and_unitary_implementation","38082160_Quantum_Algorithm_for_Linear_Systems_of_Equations","2207973_On_the_Relationship_Between_Continuous-_and_Discrete-Time_Quantum_Walk","2189507_Adiabatic_Quantum_State_Generation_and_Statistical_Zero_Knowledge","1956811_Nearly-Linear_Time_Algorithms_for_Graph_Partitioning_Graph_Sparsification_and_Solving_Linear_Systems","1914093_Graph_Sparsification_by_Effective_Resistances","1744971_Eigenvalue_Bounds_Spectral_Partitioning_and_Metrical_Deformations_via_Flows","1736141_Max_Cut_and_the_Smallest_Eigenvalue"]}
