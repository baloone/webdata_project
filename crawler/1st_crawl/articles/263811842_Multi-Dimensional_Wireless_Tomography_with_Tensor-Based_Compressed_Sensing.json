{"id":"263811842_Multi-Dimensional_Wireless_Tomography_with_Tensor-Based_Compressed_Sensing","abstract":"Wireless tomography is a technique for inferring a physical environment\nwithin a monitored region by analyzing RF signals traversed across the region.\nIn this paper, we consider wireless tomography in a two and higher\ndimensionally structured monitored region, and propose a multi-dimensional\nwireless tomography scheme based on compressed sensing to estimate a spatial\ndistribution of shadowing loss in the monitored region. In order to estimate\nthe spatial distribution, we consider two compressed sensing frameworks:\nvector-based compressed sensing and tensor-based compressed sensing. When the\nshadowing loss has a high spatial correlation in the monitored region, the\nspatial distribution has a sparsity in its frequency domain. Existing wireless\ntomography schemes are based on the vector-based compressed sensing and\nestimates the distribution by utilizing the sparsity. On the other hand, the\nproposed scheme is based on the tensor-based compressed sensing, which\nestimates the distribution by utilizing its low-rank property. We reveal that\nthe tensor-based compressed sensing has a potential for highly accurate\nestimation as compared with the vector-based compressed sensing.","authors":["Kazushi Takemoto","Takahiro Matsuda","Shinsuke Hara","Kenichi Takizawa"],"meta":["October 2017Wireless Personal Communications 96(8)","DOI:10.1007/s11277-017-4061-2","SourcearXiv"],"references":["262772014_A_Fade_Level-Based_Spatial_Model_for_Radio_Tomographic_Imaging","259782966_A_User's_Guide_to_Compressed_Sensing_for_Communications_Systems","238624772_Multilinear_Singular_Value_Tensor_Decompositions","236736746_An_Accelerated_Proximal_Gradient_Algorithm_for_Nuclear_Norm_Regularized_Least_Squares_Problems","231609926_Computing_Sparse_Representations_of_Multidimensional_Signals_Using_Kronecker_Bases","228866250_A_Multi-Linear_Singular_Value_Decomposition","313808113_Experimental_evaluation_on_a_joint_attenuation_map_estimationindoor_localization_by_means_of_compressed_sensing-based_wireless_tomography","230912132_Tensor_completion_and_low-rank_tensor_recovery_via_convex_optimization","224576132_Correlated_Link_Shadow_Fading_in_Multi-Hop_Wireless_Networks","224264166_Compressive_Cooperative_Sensing_and_Mapping_in_Mobile_Networks"]}
