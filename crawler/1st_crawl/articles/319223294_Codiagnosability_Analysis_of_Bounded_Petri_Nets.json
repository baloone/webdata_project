{"id":"319223294_Codiagnosability_Analysis_of_Bounded_Petri_Nets","abstract":"In this paper we propose a novel approach to perform codiagnosability analysis of labeled bounded Petri nets. A set of sites observe the system evolution, each one with its own observation mask. Sites do not exchange information with each other but communicate with a coordinator. The coordinator is able to detect a fault if and only if at least one site is able to do that. In a previous work by some of us it has been proved that a necessary and sufficient condition for codiagnosability under such a framework, is the absence of sequences that are “ambiguous” with respect to all sites and whose length may grow indefinitely after the occurrence of some fault. The novelties of the approach consist in using the notion of basis markings to avoid exhaustive enumeration of the set of reachable markings, and in the construction of an automaton, called Verifier, that allows one to detect the presence of ambiguous sequences.","authors":["Ning Ran","Hongye Su","Alessandro Giua","Carla Seatzu"],"meta":["August 2017IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TAC.2017.2742659"],"references":["283672289_Codiagnosability_and_coobservability_under_dynamic_observations_Transformation_and_verification","260711455_Diagnosability_of_Discrete-Event_Systems_Using_Labeled_Petri_Nets","260661823_A_New_Approach_for_Diagnosability_Analysis_of_Petri_Nets_Using_Verifier_Nets","224215049_On_Codiagnosability_and_Coobservability_With_Dynamic_Observations","224126868_The_Diagnosability_of_Petri_Net_Models_Using_Minimal_Explanations","220652123_Coordinated_Decentralized_Protocols_for_Failure_Diagnosis_of_Discrete_Event_Systems","3412515_Decentralized_failure_diagnosis_of_discrete_event_systems","3022357_Diagnosability_of_Discrete_Event_Systems","2370706_A_Polynomial_Algorithm_for_Testing_Diagnosability_of_Discrete_Event_Systems","312110700_Codiagnosability_verification_of_bounded_Petri_nets_using_basis_markings","285842809_Petri_Nets_Properties_Analysis_and_Applications","271467699_Decentralized_K-Diagnosability_of_Petri_Nets","271461115_Decentralized_Diagnosability_Analysis_of_Discrete_Event_Systems_Using_Petri_Nets","256660817_Diagnosability_of_labeled_Petri_nets_via_Integer_Linear_Programming","229218415_Discrete_event_diagnosis_using_labeled_Petri_nets_An_application_to_manufacturing_systems","222645987_Fault_detection_for_discrete_event_systems_using_Petri_nets_with_unobservable_transitions","220387247_Verification_of_Codiagnosability_for_Discrete_Event_Systems_Modeled_by_Mealy_Automata_With_Nondeterministic_Output_Functions","213894633_Depth-First_Search_and_Linear_Graph_Algorithms","3024475_Polynomial-time_verification_of_diagnosability_of_partially_observed_discrete-event_systems"]}
