{"id":"308495915_Templet_a_markup_language_for_concurrent_actor-oriented_programming","abstract":"The article presents a markup domain-specific language (DSL) for concurrent programming. Runtime libraries and language extensions are the usual ways to implement parallel execution. However, their using often requires a special programming skill. The modern languages with build-in parallel con- structs are more convenient for programming, but they are poorly integrated with existing high performance computing infrastructure. We propose a com- promise solution which uses DSL together with C++ programming language. The article discusses syntax, programming model, and some practical applica- tions of the language.","authors":["Sergei V.
