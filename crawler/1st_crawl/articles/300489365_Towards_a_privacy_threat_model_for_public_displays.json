{"id":"300489365_Towards_a_privacy_threat_model_for_public_displays","abstract":"While public displays have proliferated in many areas, passersby frequently do not perceive the contents shown as useful. One way to provide relevant content is to show personalized information or to let users personalize displays interactively. However, this approach raises privacy concerns. To gain a better understanding of these concerns, we carried out a study assessing the applicability of an existing threat model to public displays. We report on key outcomes, propose an extended privacy threat model tailored to interactive public displays, and provide an assessment of the importance of different privacy threats in various application scenarios. Engineers of interactive displays may use our findings to systematically analyze privacy requirements and threats, which in turn may lead to privacy-aware designs that can positively affect user attitude and display usage.","authors":["Morin Ostkamp","Christian Kray","Gernot Bauer"],"meta":["June 2015","DOI:10.1145/2774225.2775072","Conference: the 7th ACM SIGCHI Symposium"],"references":["269912815_Evaluation_of_a_Mobile_Projector-Based_Indoor_Navigation_Interface","262412474_Adaptive_security_and_privacy_management_for_the_internet_of_things_ASPI_2013","221514667_Single_display_privacyware_augmenting_public_displays_with_private_information","221022401_Web-based_framework_for_spatiotemporal_screen_real_estate_management_of_interactive_public_displays","291127084_Threat_modeling-uncover_security_design_flaws_using_the_stride_approach","289681730_Supporting_design_prototyping_and_evaluation_of_public_display_systems","286244720_Mitigation_of_SQL_Injection_Attacks_using_Threat_Modeling","221568536_BlueTone_A_Framework_for_Interacting_with_Public_Displays_Using_Dual-Tone_Multi-Frequency_through_Bluetooth","221325142_Non-repudiation_mechanisms_for_peer-to-peer_networks_Enabling_technology_for_peer-to-peer_economic_markets","221187709_Friend_or_Foe_Relationship-Based_Adaptation_on_Public_Displays"]}
