A wide range of methods and techniques for replacing missing teeth appeared in dentistry. They are constantly improved with the evolution of the scientific base and at the same time new methods, materials and technologies are found to minimize or eliminate the inherent deficiencies in some methods of treating edentate. The selective laser sintering technology allows the execution of dental prosthesis considering all individual particularities of the patient's anatomy to realize them more comfortable and su pportable. In addition, this process has considerable advantages compared with traditional methods used in prosthetic dentistry.","authors":["Edgar Moraru","Octavian Dontu","Petre Alexandru","Danut-Ionel Vaireanu"],"meta":["July 2020Journal of Optoelectronics and Advanced Materials 20(3-4):208-213"],"references":["322159078_Post-processing_of_customized_implants_made_by_laser_beam_melting_from_pure_Titanium","303755679_Structural_characterization_and_properties_analysis_of_CoCrMoSi_Alloys","241699851_Binding_Mechanisms_in_Selective_Laser_Sintering_and_Selective_Laser_Melting","309130618_The_advanced_characterization_of_a_new_alloy_by_Co-Cr-Mo_system","228785611_Rapid_manufacturing_of_dental_prostheses_by_means_of_Selective_Laser_SinteringMelting","11426985_Enhanced_Periodontal_Response_and_Esthetics_of_Implant-Supported_Bridge_by_the_Use_of_Galvanoforming_Technique_Case_Report"]}
