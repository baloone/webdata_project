{"id":"270451739_Filtering_algorithm_for_constraints_of_difference_in_CSPs","abstract":"Many real-life Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) involve some constraints similar to the alld-ifferent constraints. These constraints are called con-straints of difference. They are defined on a subset of variables by a set of tuples for which the values oc-curing in the same tuple are all different. In this pa-per, a new filtering algorithm for these constraints is presented. It achieves the generalized arc-consistency condition for these non-binary constraints. It is based on matching theory and its complexity is low. In fact, for a constraint defined on a subset of p variables hav-ing domains of cardinality at most d, its space com-plexity is OCpd) and its time complexity is O(p2d2). This filtering algorithm has been successfully used in the system RESYN (Vismara et al. 1992), to solve the subgraph isomorphism problem.","authors":["Jean-Charles RÃ©gin"],"meta":["July 1994","Conference: AAAI-94"],"references":["242600743_An_n2_algorithm_for_maximum_matching_in_bipartite_graphs","232619217_Depth-First_Search_and_Linear_Graph_Algorithms","223139618_Arc-Consistency_and_Arc-Consistency_Again","222464406_Enhancement_schemes_for_constraint_processing_Backjumping_learning_and_cutset_decomposition","222444557_Consistency_in_Networks_of_Relations","222443721_A_generic_arc-consistency_algorithm_and_its_specializations","222437011_Arc_and_Path_Consistency_Revisited","222369413_Computing_a_maximum_cardinality_matching_in_a_bipartite_graph_in_time_On15","221606146_Arc-Consistency_and_Arc-Consistency_Again","220836640_Good_Old_Discrete_Relaxation"]}
