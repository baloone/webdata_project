{"id":"275669778_Socially_Optimal_Coexistence_of_Wireless_Body_Area_Networks_Enabled_by_a_Non-Cooperative_Game","abstract":"In this paper, we enable the coexistence of multiple wireless body area\nnetworks (BANs) using a finite repeated non-cooperative game for transmit power\ncontrol. With no coordination amongst these personal sensor networks, the\nproposed game maximizes each network's packet delivery ratio (PDR) at low\ntransmit power. In this context we provide a novel utility function, which\ngives reduced benefit to players with higher transmission power, and a\nsubsequent reduction in radio interference to other coexisting BANs.\nConsidering the purpose of inter-BAN interference mitigation, PDR is expressed\nas a compressed exponential function of inverse\nsignal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR), so it is essentially a function\nof transmit powers of all coexisting BANs. It is shown that a unique Nash\nEquilibrium (NE) exists, and hence there is a subgame-perfect equilibrium,\nconsidering best-response at each stage independent of history. In addition,\nthe NE is proven to be the socially optimal solution across all action\nprofiles. Realistic and extensive on- and inter-body channel models are\nemployed. Results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in better\ninterference management, greater reliability and reduced transmit power, when\ncompared with other schemes that can be applied in BANs.","authors":["Jie Dong","David Smith","Leif W.
