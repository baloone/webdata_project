{"id":"272391953_The_parameterised_complexity_of_counting_connected_subgraphs_and_graph_motifs","abstract":"We introduce a family of parameterised counting problems on graphs, p-#Induced Subgraph With Property(Φ), which generalises a number of problems which have previously been studied. This paper focuses on the case in which Φ defines a family of graphs whose edge-minimal elements all have bounded treewidth; this includes the special case in which Φ describes the property of being connected. We show that exactly counting the number of connected induced k-vertex subgraphs in an n-vertex graph is #W[1]-hard, but on the other hand there exists an FPTRAS for the problem; more generally, we show that there exists an FPTRAS for p-#Induced Subgraph With Property(Φ) whenever Φ is monotone and all the minimal graphs satisfying Φ have bounded treewidth. We then apply these results to a counting version of the Graph Motif problem.","authors":["Mark Jerrum","Kitty Meeks"],"meta":["June 2015Journal of Computer and System Sciences 81(4):702-716","DOI:10.1016/j.jcss.2014.11.015"],"references":["305426873_Finding_and_Counting_Vertex-Colored_Subtrees","225160043_Understanding_the_Complexity_of_Induced_Subgraph_Isomorphisms","221544091_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Some_Parameterized_Counting_Problems","221313940_Parameterized_Algorithms_and_Hardness_Results_for_Some_Graph_Motif_Problems","220438273_Assessing_the_Exceptionality_of_Coloured_Motifs_in_Networks","51631290_Assessing_the_Exceptionality_of_Coloured_Motifs_in_Networks","29598351_Maximum_Motif_Problem_in_Vertex-Colored_Graphs","29598161_Weak_pattern_matching_in_colored_graphs_Minimizing_the_number_of_connected_components","6710980_Motif_Search_in_Graphs_Application_to_Metabolic_Networks","4354999_Monte-Carlo_algorithms_for_enumeration_and_reliability_problems","4257905_On_Parameterized_Path_and_Chordless_Path_Problems","301852696_Finding_and_counting_vertex-colored_subtrees","281740143_Some_Hard_Families_of_Parameterized_Counting_Problems","263855888_Complexity_of_Counting_Subgraphs_Only_the_Boundedness_of_the_Vertex-Cover_Number_Counts","262164035_Counting_Matchings_of_Size_k_Is_sharp_W1-Hard","258083779_Some_hard_classes_of_parameterised_counting_problems","228057698_Color-Coding","227088955_On_the_foundations_of_combinatorial_theory_I_Theory_of_Mbius_Functions","225342023_Parameterized_Counting_Problems","225174715_Parameterized_Complexity_of_Finding_Subgraphs_with_Hereditary_Properties","223082244_The_complexity_of_counting_homomorphisms_seen_from_the_other_side","222538387_On_the_Parameterized_Complexity_of_Multiple-Interval_Graph_Problems","222507592_On_meet_matrices_on_posets","221427163_Parameterized_Complexity_of_Finding_Subgraphs_with_Hereditary_Properties","220975844_Parameterized_Counting_Problems","220618044_The_Parameterized_Complexity_of_Counting_Problems","220574542_Upper_and_lower_bounds_for_finding_connected_motifs_in_vertex-colored_graphs","4004066_The_parameterized_complexity_of_counting_problems"]}
