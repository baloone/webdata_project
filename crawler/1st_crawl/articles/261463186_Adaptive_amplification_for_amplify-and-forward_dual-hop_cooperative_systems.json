{"id":"261463186_Adaptive_amplification_for_amplify-and-forward_dual-hop_cooperative_systems","abstract":"The amplify-and-forward protocol is a simple but effective relaying for cooperative communications systems because its associated relay node does not take encoding/decoding into consideration to re-transmit signals. However, the interference and multipath fades during the previous hop are also amplified. In this paper, based on the zero-forcing (ZF) concept, an adaptive amplification factor is investigated to counteract the effects of the multipath-fading channel. Numerical results show that the ZF-based adaptive amplification according to both channel impulse responses possesses the best system performance in a dual-hop cooperative system.","authors":["Tsan-Ming Wu","Szu-Liang Wang"],"meta":["June 2012Digest of Technical Papers - IEEE International Conference on Consumer Electronics","DOI:10.1109/ISCE.2012.6241716","Conference: Consumer Electronics (ISCE), 2012 IEEE 16th International Symposium on"],"references":["224676099_A_Chunk_Based_OFDM_Amplify-and-Forward_Relaying_Scheme_for_4G_Mobile_Radio_Systems","224575345_Performance_Measure_Analysis_of_Amplify-and-Forward_Relaying_over_Non-Identical_Nakagami-m_Fading_Channel","224569157_Recent_Advances_in_Amplify-and-Forward_Two-Hop_Relaying","4062807_Transmit_power_efficiency_of_a_multi-hop_virtual_cellular_system","3432973_A_Performance_Study_of_Dual-Hop_Transmissions_With_Fixed_Gain_Relays","3235920_Fading_Relay_Channels_Performance_Limits_and_Space-Time_Signal_Design","3235729_From_Theory_to_Practice_An_overview_of_MIMO_space-time_coded_wireless_systems","3161364_Cooperative_Coding_For_Wireless_Networks","3161089_User_Cooperation_Diversity_-_Part_I_System_Description","3085253_Cooperative_Diversity_in_Wireless_Networks_Efficient_Protocols_and_Outage_Behavior","3084864_Distributed_Space-Time-Coded_Protocols_for_Exploiting_Cooperative_Diversity_in_Wireless_Networks","2434748_Energy-Efficient_Antenna_Sharing_and_Relaying_for_Wireless_Networks"]}
