{"id":"263354970_The_Research_on_Web-Based_Testing_Environment_Using_Simulated_Annealing_Algorithm","abstract":"The computerized evaluation is now one of the most important methods to diagnose learning; with the application of artificial intelligence techniques in the field of evaluation, the computerized adaptive testing gradually becomes one of the most important evaluation methods. In this test, the computer dynamic updates the learner's ability level and selects tailored items from the item pool. In order to meet the needs of the test it requires that the system has a relatively high efficiency of the implementation. To solve this problem, we proposed a novel method of web-based testing environment based on simulated annealing algorithm. In the development of the system, through a series of experiments, we compared the simulated annealing method and other methods of the efficiency and efficacy. The experimental results show that this method ensures choosing nearly optimal items from the item bank for learners, meeting a variety of assessment needs, being reliable, and having valid judgment in the ability of learners. In addition, using simulated annealing algorithm to solve the computing complexity of the system greatly improves the efficiency of select items from system and near-optimal solutions.","authors":["Peng Lu","Xiao Cong","Dongdai Zhou"],"meta":["May 2014The Scientific World Journal 2014(1):167124","DOI:10.1155/2014/167124","SourcePubMed"],"references":["289399993_A_hybrid_simulated_annealing_algorithm_for_the_three-dimensional_packing_problem","268011379_Reducing_the_Impact_of_Inappropriate_Items_on_Reviewable_Computerized_Adaptive_Testing","260710747_Ability_estimation_in_CAT_with_Fuzzy_logic","287152604_The_Study_of_Item_Selection_Method_in_CAT","273995276_Design_and_Implementation_of_Computerized_Adaptive_Testing_System_for_Multi-Terminals","266889340_Evaluating_Knowledge_Structure-based_Adaptive_Testing_Algorithms_and_System_Development","262367238_Integrating_computerized_adaptive_testing_into_UZWEBMAT_Implementation_of_individualized_assessment_module_in_an_e-learning_system","255626479_An_Introduction_to_the_Computerized_Adaptive_Testing","247742536_Improving_Measurement_Quality_and_Efficiency_with_Adaptive_Testing","240512935_Applying_Dynamic_Fuzzy_Petri_Net_to_web_learning_system"]}
