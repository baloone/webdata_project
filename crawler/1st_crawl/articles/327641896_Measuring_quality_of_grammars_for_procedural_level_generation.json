{"id":"327641896_Measuring_quality_of_grammars_for_procedural_level_generation","abstract":"Grammar-based procedural level generation raises the productivity of level designers for games such as dungeon crawl and platform games. However, the improved productivity comes at cost of level quality assurance. Authoring, improving and maintaining grammars is difficult because it is hard to predict how each grammar rule impacts the overall level quality, and tool support is lacking. We propose a novel metric called Metric of Added Detail (MAD) that indicates if a rule adds or removes detail with respect to its phase in the transformation pipeline, and Specification Analysis Reporting (SAnR) for expressing level properties and analyzing how qualities evolve in level generation histories. We demonstrate MAD and SAnR using a prototype of a level generator called Ludoscope Lite. Our preliminary results show that problematic rules tend to break SAnR properties and that MAD intuitively raises flags. MAD and SAnR augment existing approaches, and can ultimately help designers make better levels and level generators.","authors":["Riemer van Rozen","Quinten Heijn"],"meta":["August 2018","DOI:10.1145/3235765.3235821","Conference: the 13th International Conference"],"references":["319363116_Understanding_mario_an_evaluation_of_design_metrics_for_platformers","300137911_Tracery_An_Author-Focused_Generative_Text_Tool","288320122_Designing_procedurally_generated_levels","276951339_Domain-Specific_Languages","260800341_Procedural_Generation_of_Dungeons","238069446_A_Practical_Model_for_Measuring_Maintainability_-_a_preliminary_report","228411962_Analyzing_the_expressive_range_of_a_level_generator","220703689_RASCAL_A_Domain_Specific_Language_for_Source_Code_Analysis_and_Manipulation","220178552_Domain-Specific_Languages_An_Annotated_Bibliography","4276839_A_Practical_Model_for_Measuring_Maintainability","4211296_Challenges_in_software_evolution","323247501_Artificial_Intelligence_and_Games","309280537_Procedural_Content_Generation_in_Games","228994305_Adventures_in_level_design_Generating_missions_and_spaces_for_action_adventure_games","228747742_Level_design_as_model_transformation_A_strategy_for_automated_content_generation","224240207_Answer_Set_Programming_for_Procedural_Content_Generation_A_Design_Space_Approach"]}
