{"id":"325222784_Enhancing_programming_logic_thinking_using_analogy_mapping","abstract":"Programming logic thinking is the most important competence for computer science students. However, programming is one of the difficult subject in computer science program. This paper reports our work about enhancing students' programming logic thinking using Analogy Mapping for basic programming subject. Analogy Mapping is a computer application which converts source code into analogies images. This research used time series evaluation and the result showed that Analogy Mapping can enhance students' programming logic thinking.","authors":["Rosa Ariani Sukamto","R Megasari"],"meta":["May 2018Journal of Physics Conference Series 1013(1):012155","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/1013/1/012155"],"references":["315922913_Analogy_Mapping_Development_for_Learning_Programming","283772956_Algorithmic_and_logical_thinking_development_Base_of_programming_skills","271746747_The_Effects_of_Teaching_Programming_via_Scratch_on_Problem_Solving_Skills_A_Discussion_from_Learners'_Perspective","257719457_Learning_Programming_at_the_Computational_Thinking_Level_via_Digital_Game-Play","228710512_Interactive-Engagement_Versus_Traditional_Methods_A_Six-Thousand-Student_Survey_of_Mechanics_Test_Data_for_Introductory_Physics_Courses","23142610_Computational_thinking_and_thinking_about_computing","320147211_PERCEPTION_OF_VISUAL_ARTS_FROM_NEUROAESTHETICS_PERSPECTIVE_NOROESTETIK_PERSPEKTIFINDEN_GORSEL_SANATLARA_BAKIS","294100866_Philosophical_Transactions_of_the_Royal_Society_A_Mathematical_Physical_and_Engineering_Sciences_Preface","267216854_Collaboration_Collusion_and_Plagiarism_in_Computer_Science_Coursework","220692029_Simply_logical_intelligent_reasoning_by_example"]}
