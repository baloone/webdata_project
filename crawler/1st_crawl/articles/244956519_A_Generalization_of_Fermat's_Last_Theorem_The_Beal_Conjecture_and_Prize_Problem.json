{"id":"244956519_A_Generalization_of_Fermat's_Last_Theorem_The_Beal_Conjecture_and_Prize_Problem","abstract":"The author reports on the ‘Beal conjecture’ (posed by Andrew Beal, a bank owner in Dalls (Texas)) that is closely related to the ‘abc-conjecture’: Let A,B,C,x,y, and z be positive integers with x,y,z>2. If A x +B y =C z , then A,B and C have a common factor. Or, slightly restated: The equation A x +B y =C z has no solution in positive integers A,B,C,x,y, and z with x,y, and z at least 3 and A,B, and C coprime. The author also mentions recent studies of Darmon and Granville on the Fermat-Catalan conjecture.","authors":["R. Daniel Mauldin"],"meta":["January 1998"],"references":[]}
