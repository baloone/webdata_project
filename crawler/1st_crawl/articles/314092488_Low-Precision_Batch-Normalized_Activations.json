{"id":"314092488_Low-Precision_Batch-Normalized_Activations","abstract":"Artificial neural networks can be trained with relatively low-precision floating-point and fixed-point arithmetic, using between one and 16 bits. Previous works have focused on relatively wide-but-shallow, feed-forward networks. We introduce a quantization scheme that is compatible with training very deep neural networks. Quantizing the network activations in the middle of each batch-normalization module can greatly reduce the amount of memory and computational power needed, with little loss in accuracy.","authors":["Benjamin Graham"],"meta":["February 2017"],"references":["319770123_Densely_Connected_Convolutional_Networks","309766061_A_Convolutional_Encoder_Model_for_Neural_Machine_Translation","308457764_Quantized_Neural_Networks_Training_Neural_Networks_with_Low_Precision_Weights_and_Activations","303270485_Ternary_Weight_Networks","301878902_Recurrent_Batch_Normalization","301878495_SqueezeNet_AlexNet-level_accuracy_with_50x_fewer_parameters_and_05MB_model_size","282844341_Neural_Networks_with_Few_Multiplications","319770414_Identity_Mappings_in_Deep_Residual_Networks","319770334_Deep_Compression_Compressing_Deep_Neural_Networks_with_Pruning_Trained_Quantization_and_Huffman_Coding","319770230_XNOR-Net_ImageNet_Classification_Using_Binary_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","319770111_Improving_the_speed_of_neural_networks_on_CPUs","319769906_Training_deep_neural_networks_with_low_precision_multiplications","317722873_The_microsoft_2016_conversational_speech_recognition_system","317194083_Wide_Residual_Networks","308646556_Google's_Neural_Machine_Translation_System_Bridging_the_Gap_between_Human_and_Machine_Translation","303969947_Deep_Recurrent_Models_with_Fast-Forward_Connections_for_Neural_Machine_Translatin","303840259_Deep_neural_networks_are_robust_to_weight_binarization_and_other_non-linear_distortions","303520977_FractalNet_Ultra-Deep_Neural_Networks_without_Residuals","301874967_Inception-v4_Inception-ResNet_and_the_Impact_of_Residual_Connections_on_Learning","301841689_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_using_Logarithmic_Data_Representation","300408292_Learning_Spatiotemporal_Features_with_3D_Convolutional_Networks","283471201_BinaryConnect_Training_Deep_Neural_Networks_with_binary_weights_during_propagations","265385906_Very_Deep_Convolutional_Networks_for_Large-Scale_Image_Recognition","221618644_Backpropagation_without_Multiplication","221345737_Rectified_Linear_Units_Improve_Restricted_Boltzmann_Machines_Vinod_Nair"]}
