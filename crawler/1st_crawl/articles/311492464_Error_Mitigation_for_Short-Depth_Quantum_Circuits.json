{"id":"311492464_Error_Mitigation_for_Short-Depth_Quantum_Circuits","abstract":"Two schemes are presented that mitigate the effect of errors and decoherence in short depth quantum circuits. The size of the circuits for which these techniques can be applied is limited by the rate at which the errors in the computation are introduced. Near term applications of early quantum devices, such as quantum simulations, rely on accurate estimates of expectation values to become relevant. Decoherence and gate errors lead to wrong estimates of the expectation values of observables used to evaluate the noisy circuit. The two schemes we discuss are deliberately simple and don't require additional qubit resources to be as practically relevant in current experiments as possible. The first method, extrapolation to the zero noise limit, subsequently cancels powers of the noise perturbations by an application of Richardson's deferred approach to the limit. The second method cancel errors by resampling randomized circuits according to a quasi-probability distribution.","authors":["Kristan Temme","Sergey Bravyi","Jay M.
