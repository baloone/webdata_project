{"id":"326645995_FLOWCHART_DISCOVERY_GAME_FOR_BASIC_PROGRAMMING_COURSE_FLOWGAME","abstract":"Flowchart is a guidance for constructing the basic programming language. Currently, programming is one of the compulsory subjects for Computer Science students. However, study shows that this subject is unable to be understood by learning in fully text. This is due to inadequate tools and learning styles in programming. This area has non-interactive way of learning where there is no any interaction method with the students. To address this issue, FlowGame is developed as an aid to learn flowchart technique in game-based environment. Design Science Research (DSR) is implemented throughout the study to create the solutions for the problem, make it applicable in computer science, engineering and in ICT disciplines. From the results, FlowGame is well-accepted from the experts and users. The results also indicate that the application is helpful for increasing studentsâ€™ understanding in learning and creating flowchart. \nKeywords: Discovery game, flowchart, game-based learning, gamification, helpfulness.","authors":["Norfiza Ibrahim","Nur Fatin Syahirah Saifuzzin","Azmi Abu Seman","Nadia Abdul Wahab"],"meta":["May 2018Journal of Applied and Fundamental Sciences","DOI:10.4314/jfas.v10i1s.81"],"references":["275771782_Learning_Resilience_in_the_Face_of_Bias_Online_Gaming_Protective_Communities_and_Interest-driven_Digital_Learning","258105864_Enjoy_and_learn_with_educational_games_Examining_factors_affecting_learning_performance","315611174_Applying_an_Online_Game-based_Formative_Assessment_in_a_Flowchart-based_Intelligent_Tutoring_System_for_Improving_Problem-Solving_Skills","312897437_Evaluation_of_the_interactivity_of_web-based_learning_systems_Principles_and_process","304043999_Online_30---The_rise_of_the_gamer_educator_the_potential_role_of_gamification_in_online_education","285838293_A_Framework_for_Theory_Development_in_Design_Science_Research_Multiple_Perspectives","282282097_Operational_Practices_and_Archetypes_of_Design_Thinking","271298075_Engaging_Computer_Science_Students_through_Gamification_in_an_Online_Social_Network_Based_Collaborative_Learning_Environment","262302821_Flowgen_Flowchart-Based_Documentation_for_C_Codes"]}
