{"id":"232543983_Key_Competencies_for_A_Successful_Life_and_Well-functioning_Society","abstract":"The importance of flexibility, adaptability, and mobility in the global economy and the information society is a leading theme in current discourse on education and training. Adults of the 21st century are expected to fulfill many different roles throughout life, act in different texts, and meet multiple challenges. Defining the competencies needed to meet these expectations is at the heart of the international, interdisciplinary, and policy-oriented research program DeSeCo--Definition and Selection of Competencies: Theoretical and Conceptual Foundations. Three categories of key competencies--interacting in socially heterogeneous groups, acting autonomously, and using tools interactively--grounded in a holistic model of competence, constitute a core element of DeSeCo's overarching conceptual frame of reference. Key competencies are conceptualized as contribution to a successful life and a well-functioning society, as expressed by universal values. Not only does the DeSeCo framework set a conceptual context for international assessments, it also adds meaning and conceptual depth to the popular notion of life long learning. The present volume presents DeSeCo's final report. It is a vital contribution to advancing our understanding of what it means to be a competent individual and of how investments in key competencies can benefit both individuals and societies.
