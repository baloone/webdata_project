{"id":"280062502_Testing_Shape_Restrictions_of_Discrete_Distributions","abstract":"We study the question of testing structured properties (classes) of discrete\ndistributions. Specifically, given sample access to an arbitrary distribution\n$D$ over $[n]$ and a property $\\mathcal{P}$, the goal is to distinguish between\n$D\\in\\mathcal{P}$ and $\\ell_1(D,\\mathcal{P})>\\varepsilon$. We develop a general\nalgorithm for this question, which applies to a large range of\n\"shape-constrained\" properties, including monotone, log-concave, $t$-modal,\npiecewise-polynomial, and Poisson Binomial distributions. Moreover, for all\ncases considered, our algorithm has near-optimal sample complexity with regard\nto the domain size and is computationally efficient. For most of these classes,\nwe provide the first non-trivial tester in the literature. In addition, we also\ndescribe a generic method to prove lower bounds for this problem, and use it to\nshow our upper bounds are nearly tight. Finally, we extend some of our\ntechniques to tolerant testing, deriving nearly-tight upper and lower bounds\nfor the corresponding questions.","authors":["Cl√©ment L.
