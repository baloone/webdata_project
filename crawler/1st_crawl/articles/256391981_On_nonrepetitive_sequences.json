{"id":"256391981_On_nonrepetitive_sequences","abstract":"We prove the following results: (1) There exists an infinite binary sequence having no identical adjacent blocks of length 3 or greater. (2) Every binary sequence of length greater than 18 has identical adjacent blocks of length 2 or greater. (3) Every infinite binary sequence has arbitrarily long adjacent blocks that are permutations of each other.","authors":["R.C Entringer","D.E Jackson","J.A Schatz"],"meta":["March 1974Journal of Combinatorial Theory Series A 16(2):159â€“164","DOI:10.1016/0097-3165(74)90041-7","Sourcedx.doi.org"],"references":["313062315_Uuer_Unendliche_Zeichenreihen","300277091_New_and_Unsolved_Problems","266221282_Is_There_a_Sequence_on_Four_Symbols_in_Which_No_Two_Adjacent_Segments_are_Permutations_of_One_Another","265327408_Remarks_on_the_work_of_Axel_Thue_on_sequences","231870026_Non-repetitive_sequences","38322705_Some_unsolved_problems"]}
