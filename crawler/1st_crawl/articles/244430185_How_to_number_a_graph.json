{"id":"244430185_How_to_number_a_graph","abstract":"This chapter explains the way of numbering a graph. The problem of numbering a graph is to assign integers to the nodes so as to achieve G(Г). The principal questions which arise in the theory of numbering the nodes of graphs revolve around the relationship between G(Г) and e, for example, identifying classes of graphs for which G(Г)= e and other classes for which G(Г)< e and looking for bounds on G(Г)—e. A graph for which G(Г)= e will be called a graceful graph, and the numbering which achieves G(Г)= e, a graceful numbering. For numbering graphs, Euclidean model is used and in this model, the result of placing the numbered nodes on the corresponding positions along the real axis and connecting them as in the original graph. It is generally a convenient tool in visualizing or simplifying problems involving numbering of graphs.","authors":["Solomon Golomb"],"meta":["December 1972","DOI:10.1016/B978-1-4832-3187-7.50008-8"],"references":[]}
