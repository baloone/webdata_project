Subsequently, it examines how participation in the course influences pre-service teachers' dispositions and knowledge of computational thinking concepts and the ways in which such knowledge can be combined with content and pedagogy to promote meaningful student outcomes. Data were collected from a self-reported survey and case reports focusing on the design, implementation, and outcomes of computational thinking related lessons in K-8 classrooms. Results indicated that the course positively influenced pre-service teachersâ€™ knowledge of computational thinking concepts, tools, and practices. Yet, some participants demonstrated only surface understanding of computational thinking and were unable to design lessons that meaningfully integrated computational thinking concepts and tools with disciplinary content and pedagogy. Findings have implications for the design of teacher education experiences that help prepare pre-service teachers develop technological pedagogical content knowledge in relation to computational thinking concepts and practices.","authors":["Chrystalla Mouza","Hui Yang","Yi-Cheng Pan","Sule Yilmaz Ozden"],"meta":["July 2017Australasian Journal of Educational Technology 33(3)","DOI:10.14742/ajet.3521","Project: Computational Thinking"],"references":["315636456_Computational_thinking_for_teacher_education","303736675_Preservice_Teachers'_TPACK_Beliefs_and_Attitudes_Toward_Simulations","283714318_Technological_Pedagogical_Content_Knowledge_as_a_Framework_for_Integrating_Educational_Technology_in_the_Teaching_of_Computer_Science","282603860_Computational_thinking_in_compulsory_education_Towards_an_agenda_for_research_and_practice","277574355_Analyzing_Preservice_Teachers'_Technological_Pedagogical_Content_Knowledge_Development_in_the_Context_of_a_Multidimensional_Teacher_Preparation_Program","274377900_Computational_Thinking","272689932_Examining_and_Mapping_CS_Teachers'_Technological_Pedagogical_and_Content_Knowledge_TPACK_in_K-12_Schools","323424582_Statistical_power_analysis_for_the_behavioral_sciences","316597429_A_K-6_Computational_Thinking_Curriculum_Framework_Implications_for_Teacher_Knowledge","313217348_Teaching_Knowledge_with_Curriculum-Based_Technology_Development_of_a_Survey_Instrument_for_Pre-Service_Teachers"]}
