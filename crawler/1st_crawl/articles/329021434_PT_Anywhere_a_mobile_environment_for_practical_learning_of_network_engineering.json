{"id":"329021434_PT_Anywhere_a_mobile_environment_for_practical_learning_of_network_engineering","abstract":"The main challenges commonly associated with acquiring practical network engineering skills are the requirements for access to specialised and up-to-date network equipment, as well as the high costs associated with obtaining and maintaining this equipment. The PT Anywhere initiative addresses these challenges by offering a mobile environment for acquiring practical knowledge and skills of network engineering. PT Anywhere facilitates learner-centred anywhere/anytime learning and offers learners access to high-quality interactive learning resources. Additionally, PT Anywhere employs Learning Analytics in order to help learners and educators in understanding and improving learning. This paper presents the learning design and software design principles driving the development of PT Anywhere, as well as the outcomes of an evaluation session conducted with members of the Cisco Networking Academy. The results of this evaluation indicate that PT Anywhere holds the potential to engage learners in different ways inside and outside of the classroom, without the need for access to specialised equipment.","authors":["Alexander Mikroyannidis","Aitor Gomez Goiri","Andrew Smith","John Domingue"],"meta":["November 2018Interactive Learning Environments 28(3):1-15","DOI:10.1080/10494820.2018.1541911"],"references":["352375864_A_Comparison_between_the_Use_of_Cisco_Packet_Tracer_and_Graphical_Network_Simulator_3_as_Learning_Media_on_Students'_Achievement","323738752_Linking_students'_timing_of_engagement_to_learning_design_and_academic_performance_best_paper_award","307144398_Implementing_a_Learning_Analytics_Intervention_and_Evaluation_Framework_What_Works","288470760_Pedagogical_evaluation_of_simulation_tools_usage_in_Network_Technology_Education","281100519_Online_Learning_and_Experimentation_via_Interactive_Learning_Resources","50994293_Delivery_of_CCNA_as_part_of_a_distance_degree_programme","5285760_Social_constructivist_perspectives_on_teaching_and_learning","330191154_Learning_analyticsA_firm_basis_for_the_future_Perils_and_Promises_for_Learners","322929238_Mobile_Learning_for_Science_and_Mathematics_School_Education_A_Systematic_Review_of_Empirical_Evidence","317953561_Mind_in_society_The_development_of_higher_psychological_processes","317953505_Situated_learning_Legitimate_peripheral_participation","312187269_Impact_of_mobile_technology_on_student_attitudes_engagement_and_learning","309518814_Enhancing_the_Learning_Success_of_Engineering_Students_by_Virtual_Experiments","308471448_Forging_online_education_through_FIRE","285858130_Virtual_Labs_Project_A_Paradigm_Shift_in_Internet-Based_Remote_Experimentation","264922615_IEEE_Standard_Glossary_of_Software_Engineering_Terminology_IEEE","262293023_Learning_analytics_Drivers_developments_and_challenges","246676294_Situated_Learning_Legitimate_Peripheral_Practice"]}
