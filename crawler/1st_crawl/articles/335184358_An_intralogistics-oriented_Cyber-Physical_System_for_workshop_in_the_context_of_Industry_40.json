{"id":"335184358_An_intralogistics-oriented_Cyber-Physical_System_for_workshop_in_the_context_of_Industry_40","abstract":"The internal logistics in the shop-floor is extremely sophisticated for the variability and complexity of products in Industry 4.0 environment. Cyber-Physical System (CPS) which combines computer science, information and communication technologies is a critical solution to achieve Industry 4.0. To tackle with personalized production, high flexibility and rapid reconfiguration capabilities of internal logistics are required in shop-floor. Intralogistics-oriented CPS is discussed in this paper and the framework of models in cyber space for the equipment under the environment are presented. Through the utilization of wireless sensors and controllers, a remote management platform is implemented. Equipment interconnection, logistics scheduling and remote operation are realized by portable terminals via Internet. The effectiveness of the proposed solution is verified in an actual production workshop.","authors":["Jihong Yan","Mingyang Zhang","Zimin Fu"],"meta":["January 2019Procedia Manufacturing 35:1178-1183","DOI:10.1016/j.promfg.2019.06.074"],"references":["326822315_Smart_automated_guided_vehicles_for_manufacturing_in_the_context_of_Industry_40","321753750_CPSCyber_Physical_System_based_Manufacturing_System_Optimization","320496225_Assembly_system_design_in_the_Industry_40_era_a_general_framework","317826383_Simulation_of_the_Supply_of_Workplaces_by_the_AGV_in_the_Digital_Factory","306426761_Cyber-physical_systems_in_manufacturing","269709304_A_Cyber-Physical_Systems_architecture_for_Industry_40-based_manufacturing_systems","317155897_A_RFID-enabled_positioning_system_in_automated_guided_vehicle_for_smart_factories","316362471_Industry_40_and_the_current_status_as_well_as_future_prospects_on_logistics","315851162_Modelling_internal_logistics_systems_through_ontologies","311567127_Scheduling_in-house_transport_vehicles_to_feed_parts_to_automotive_assembly_lines"]}
