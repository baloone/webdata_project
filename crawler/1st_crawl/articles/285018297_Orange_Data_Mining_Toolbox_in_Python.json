{"id":"285018297_Orange_Data_Mining_Toolbox_in_Python","abstract":"Orange is a machine learning and data mining suite for data analysis through Python scripting and visual programming. Here we report on the scripting part, which features interactive data analysis and component-based assembly of data mining procedures. In the selection and design of components, we focus on the flexibility of their reuse: our principal intention is to let the user write simple and clear scripts in Python, which build upon C++ implementations of computationallyintensive tasks. Orange is intended both for experienced users and programmers, as well as for students of data mining. © 2013 Janez Demšar, Tomaž Curk, Aleš Erjavec, Črt Gorup, Tomaž Hočevar, Mitar Milutinovič, Martin Možina, Matija Polajnar, Marko Toplak, Anže Starič, Miha Stajdohar, Lan Umek, Lan Žagar, Jure Žbontar, Marinka Žitnik and Blaž Zupan.","authors":["J.
