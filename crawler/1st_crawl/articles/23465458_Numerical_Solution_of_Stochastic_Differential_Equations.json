{"id":"23465458_Numerical_Solution_of_Stochastic_Differential_Equations","abstract":"In this paper we present an adaptive multi-element generalized polynomial chaos (ME-gPC) method, which can achieve hp-convergence in random space. ME-gPC is based on the decomposition of random space and generalized polynomial chaos (gPC). Using proper numerical schemes to maintain the local orthogonality on-the-fly, we perform gPC locally and adaptively. The key idea is to combine the polynomial chaos method of h version and p version. The adaptive ME-gPC shows good performance in dealing with problems related to long-term integration, large perturbation and discontinuities. Benchmarks and applications of ME-gPC are presented.","authors":["Peter Kloeden","Eckhard Platen"],"meta":["December 2008IEEE transactions on neural networks / a publication of the IEEE Neural Networks Council 19(11):1991","SourcePubMed"],"references":["248065894_The_Wiener-Askey_polynomial_chaos_for_stochastic_di_eren-tial_equations","244934536_Multi-Element_Generalized_Polynomial_Chaos_for_Arbitrary_Probability_Measures","229086770_Spectralhp_Element_Methods_for_CFD","282714892_The_Homogeneous_Chaos","252621292_Dynamical_Properties_of_Truncated_Wiener-Hermite_Expansions","247005710_On_Generating_Orthogonal_Polynomials","231994799_On_homogeneous_chaos","230872901_Stochastic_Finite_Elements","230872719_The_Orthogonal_Development_of_Non-Linear_Functionals_in_Series_of_Fourier-Hermite_Functionals","223954911_Uncertainty_propagation_using_Wiener-Haar_expansions","220179440_Galerkin_Finite_Element_Approximations_of_Stochastic_Elliptic_Partial_Differential_Equations","223741594_Multi-resolution_analysis_of_Wiener-type_uncertainty_propagation_schemes","223377857_Solution_of_stochastic_partial_differential_equations_using_Galerkin_finite_element_techniques","222652964_An_adaptive_multi-element_generalized_polynomial_chaos_method_for_stochastic_diffential_equations","222545943_Modeling_uncertainty_in_flow_simulations_via_generalized_polynomial_chaos"]}
