{"id":"225987351_Shortest_Paths_Algorithms_Theory_and_Experimental_Evaluation","abstract":"We conduct an extensive computational study of shortest paths algorithms, including some very recent algorithms. We also suggest\nnew algorithms motivated by the experimental results and prove interesting theoretical results suggested by the experimental\ndata. Our computational study is based on several natural problem classes which identify strengths and weaknesses of various\nalgorithms. These problem classes and algorithm implementations form an environment for testing the performance of shortest\npaths algorithms. The interaction between the experimental evaluation of algorithm behavior and the theoretical analysis of\nalgorithm performance plays an important role in our research.","authors":["Boris V.
