{"id":"337427277_Design_review_of_MOOCs_application_of_e-learning_design_principles","abstract":"The purpose of this study is to explore the pedagogical design of massive open online courses (MOOCs) using evidence-based e-learning principles. MOOCs have become an important part of discourse in higher education. However, there has been shared concern on the quality of MOOCs as learning systems for engaging learners as well as fulfilling their needs. The researchers conducted a design review of 40 computer science MOOCs from two major MOOC providers. The findings indicate a relatively low application of the principles in general, with the exception of those related to the organization and presentation of content. MOOC platforms and the difficulty level of MOOCs used the application of e-learning principles and guidelines differently. Implications for future research and design of MOOCs are discussed.","authors":["Eunjung Grace Oh","Yunjeong Chang","Seung Won Park"],"meta":["December 2020Journal of Computing in Higher Education 32(1)","DOI:10.1007/s12528-019-09243-w"],"references":["332785862_Quality_Frameworks_and_Learning_Design_for_Open_Education","330010198_Evaluating_MOOCs_According_to_Instructional_Design_Principles","329358211_Instructors'_Experience_of_Designing_MOOCs_in_Higher_Education_Considerations_and_Challenges","324559398_Unpacking_the_Strategies_of_Ten_Highly_Rated_MOOCs_Implications_for_Engaging_Students_in_Large_Online_Courses","321637741_Instructional_quality_of_massive_open_online_courses_A_review_of_attitudinal_change_MOOCs","315819307_The_nature_and_level_of_learner-learner_interaction_in_a_chemistry_massive_open_online_course_MOOC","315740189_MOOCs_to_university_a_consumer_goal_and_marketing_perspective","322544342_A_systematic_review_of_research_methods_and_topics_of_the_empirical_MOOC_literature_2014-2016","319471170_Technological_Innovations_in_Large-Scale_Teaching_Five_Roots_of_Massive_Open_Online_Courses","319407483_Students'_insights_on_the_use_of_video_lectures_in_online_classes","309214524_Does_digital_competence_and_occupational_setting_influence_MOOC_participation_Evidence_from_a_cross-course_survey","306061740_Quality_frameworks_for_MOOCs","314248660_Understanding_the_quality_factors_that_influence_the_continuance_intention_of_students_toward_participation_in_MOOCs","311483718_A_systematic_approach_to_active_and_cooperative_learning_in_CS1_and_its_effects_on_CS2","309372854_Employee_Perspectives_on_MOOCs_for_Workplace_Learning"]}
