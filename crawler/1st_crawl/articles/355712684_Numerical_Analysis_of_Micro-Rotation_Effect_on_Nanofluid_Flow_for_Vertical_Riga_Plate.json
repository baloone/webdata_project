{"id":"355712684_Numerical_Analysis_of_Micro-Rotation_Effect_on_Nanofluid_Flow_for_Vertical_Riga_Plate","abstract":"The investigation of heat and mass transport properties of the flow is a key research area in mathematics, physics, engineering, and computer science. This article focuses on studying the heat and mass transport phenomenon for micropolar nanofluid flow generated by a vertical stretching Riga plate. It is assembled by including a spanwise-aligned array of alternating electrodes and permanent magnets. This technique produces electromagnetic hydrodynamic behavior in flow. Our aim for this article is to examine the influences of Brownian motion and thermophoresis on a Riga plate. We also explore the micro-rotational effects of the particles. The flow behavior of the modeled problem has also been computed numerically and presented by the graph. It is verified that the numerical computations show a good approval with the reported earlier studies. The velocity profile is computed and presented by the graph, which shows direct correspondence with the modified Hartmann number. We also show that energy and mass flux rates increase by increasing modified Hartmann numbers. The results also revealed that concentration distribution diminishes for larger values of Brownian motion, whereas temperature distribution portrays increases for larger values of both Brownian motion and thermophoresis. Moreover, it is found that concentration distribution shows direct relation with thermophoretic impact.","authors":["Hammad Alotaibi","Khuram Rafique"],"meta":["October 2021Crystals 11(11)","DOI:10.3390/cryst11111315"],"references":["350018071_EMHD_radiating_fluid_flow_along_a_vertical_Riga_plate_with_suction_in_a_rotating_system","347262929_Numerical_Solutions_of_Micropolar_Nanofluid_over_an_Inclined_Surface_Using_Keller_Box_Analysis","346938897_Investigation_of_Nanoparticles_Cu_Ag_and_Fe3O4_on_Thermophoresis_and_Viscous_Dissipation_of_MHD_Nanofluid_over_a_Stretching_Sheet_in_a_Porous_Regime_A_Numerical_Modelling","346007033_Numerical_Treatment_of_MHD_Flow_of_Casson_Nanofluid_via_Convectively_Heated_Non-Linear_Extending_Surface_with_Viscous_Dissipation_and_SuctionInjection_Effects","344236455_Hybrid_Nanofluid_Flow_Past_a_Shrinking_Cylinder_with_Prescribed_Surface_Heat_Flux","342046979_Hybrid_nanofluid_flow_towards_a_stagnation_point_on_a_stretchingshrinking_cylinder","342013650_Energy_and_Mass_Transport_of_Micropolar_Nanofluid_Flow_over_an_Inclined_Surface_with_Keller_box_Simulation","341913159_Mixed_Convective_Stagnation_Point_Flow_towards_a_Vertical_Riga_Plate_in_Hybrid_Cu-Al2O3Water_Nanofluid","344958386_Heat_transfer_of_three-dimensional_micropolar_fluid_on_a_Riga_plate","342500184_Novel_Physical_Insights_into_the_Thermodynamic_Irreversibilities_Within_Dissipative_EMHD_Fluid_Flows_Past_Over_a_Moving_Horizontal_Riga_Plate_in_the_Coexistence_of_Wall_Suction_and_Joule_Heating_Effec"]}
