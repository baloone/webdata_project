{"id":"282937305_Revisiting_Arabic_Part_of_Speech_Tagsets","abstract":"Assigning the appropriate grammatical category to a word given a context is very important step in major areas of natural language processing. A limited numbers of Part of Speech Taggers currently exist for Arabic. These taggers mainly adopt tagsets that were developed for languages such as English.
