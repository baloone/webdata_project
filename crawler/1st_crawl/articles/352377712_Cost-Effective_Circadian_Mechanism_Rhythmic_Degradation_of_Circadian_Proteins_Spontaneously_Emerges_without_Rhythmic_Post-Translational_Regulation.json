{"id":"352377712_Cost-Effective_Circadian_Mechanism_Rhythmic_Degradation_of_Circadian_Proteins_Spontaneously_Emerges_without_Rhythmic_Post-Translational_Regulation","abstract":"Circadian protein oscillations are maintained by the lifelong repetition of protein production and degradation in daily balance. It comes at the cost of ever-replayed, futile protein synthesis each day. This biosynthetic cost with a given oscillatory protein profile is relievable by a rhythmic, not constant, degradation rate that selectively peaks at the right time of day but remains low elsewhere, saving much of the gross protein loss and of the replenishing protein synthesis. Here, our mathematical modeling reveals that the rhythmic degradation rate of proteins with circadian production spontaneously emerges under steady and limited activity of proteolytic mediators, and does not necessarily require rhythmic post-translational regulation of previous focus. Additional (yet steady) post-translational modifications in a proteolytic pathway can further facilitate the degradationâ€™s rhythmicity in favor of the biosynthetic cost saving. Our work is supported by animal and plant circadian data, offering a generic mechanism for potentially-widespread, time-dependent protein turnover.","authors":["Roktaek Lim","Junghun Chae","David Somers","Cheol-Min Ghim"],"meta":["June 2021iScience 24(7):102726","DOI:10.1016/j.isci.2021.102726"],"references":["345175941_Supplementary_Materials_Wake-sleep_cycles_are_severely_disrupted_by_diseases_affecting_cytoplasmic_homeostasis","344287095_The_GSK-3b-FBXL21_Axis_Contributes_to_Circadian_TCAP_Degradation_and_Skeletal_Muscle_Function","339855504_Mass-spectrometry-based_draft_of_the_Arabidopsis_proteome","339835152_Reshaping_of_the_Arabidopsis_thaliana_Proteome_Landscape_and_Co-regulation_of_Proteins_in_Development_and_Immunity","339008987_SciPy_10_fundamental_algorithms_for_scientific_computing_in_Python","331912804_Conditional_Protein_Function_via_N-Degron_Pathway-Mediated_Proteostasis_in_Stress_Physiology","329192554_Waveforms_of_molecular_oscillations_reveal_circadian_timekeeping_mechanisms","344460729_Reshaping_of_the_Arabidopsis_thaliana_proteome_landscape_and_co-regulation_of_proteins_in_development_and_immunity","330092314_The_arrival_of_circadian_medicine","328922452_Distinct_control_of_PERIOD2_degradation_and_circadian_rhythms_by_the_oncoprotein_and_ubiquitin_ligase_MDM2"]}
