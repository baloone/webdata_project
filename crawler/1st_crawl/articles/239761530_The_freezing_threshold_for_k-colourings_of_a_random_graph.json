{"id":"239761530_The_freezing_threshold_for_k-colourings_of_a_random_graph","abstract":"We rigorously determine the exact freezing threshold, rkf, for k-colourings of a random graph. We prove that for random graphs with density above rkf, almost every colouring is such that a linear number of variables are frozen, meaning that their colours cannot be changed by a sequence of alterations whereby we change the colours of o(n) vertices at a time, always obtaining another proper colouring. When the density is below rkf, then almost every colouring has at most o(n) frozen variables. This confirms hypotheses made using the non-rigorous cavity method. It has been hypothesized that the freezing threshold is the cause of the \"algorithmic barrier\", the long observed phenomenon that when the edge-density of a random graph exceeds hf k ln k(1+ok(1)), no algorithms are known to find k-colourings, despite the fact that this density is only half the k-colourability threshold.\nWe also show that rkf is the threshold of a strong form of reconstruction for k-colourings of the Galton-Watson tree, and of the graphical model.","authors":["Michael Molloy"],"meta":["May 2012Proceedings of the Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing","DOI:10.1145/2213977.2214060"],"references":["228824437_Cores_and_Connectivity_in_Sparse_Random_Graphs","227027122_Constraint_optimisation_and_landscapes","220432474_A_New_Look_at_Survey_Propagation_and_Its_Generalizations","220345624_Survey_propagation_An_algorithm_for_satisfiability","51939042_The_condensation_transition_in_random_hypergraph_2-coloring","51918766_The_set_of_solutions_of_random_XORSAT_formulae","24304845_Reconstruction_and_Clustering_in_Random_Constraint_Satisfaction_Problems","24163814_Decay_Of_Correlations_For_Sparse_Graph_Error_Correcting_Codes","24014765_Quiet_Planting_in_the_Locked_Constraint_Satisfaction_Problems","24000409_On_the_Diameter_of_the_Set_of_Satisfying_Assignments_in_Random_Satisfiable_-CNF_Formulas","10988252_Coloring_Random_Graphs","10962477_Random_K-satisfiability_problem_From_an_analytic_solution_to_an_efficient_algorithm","6268915_Gibbs_States_and_the_Set_of_Solutions_of_Random_Constraint_Satisfaction_Problems","5915439_Phase_Transitions_in_the_Coloring_of_Random_Graphs","2769087_Hard_and_Easy_Distributions_of_SAT_Problems","2735344_Where_really_hard_problems_are","2549987_The_Threshold_for_Random_k-SAT_is_2k_ln_2_o1","2099361_Information_flow_on_trees","313609388_On_the_evolution_of_random_graphs","313429549_The_analysis_of_a_list-coloring_algorithm_on_a_random_graph","268496537_Random_Graphs","262319902_A_Critical_Point_for_Random_Graphs_with_a_Given_Degree_Sequence","258873733_On_coloring_random_graphs","243781841_A_probabilistic_proof_of_an_asymptotic_formula_for_the_number_of_labelled_regular_graphs","243134926_Sudden_Emergence_of_a_Giantk-Core_in_a_Random_Graph","243100362_On_Some_Features_of_the_Structure_of_a_Random_Graph_Near_a_Critical_Point","242429224_On_the_geographical_problem_of_four_colors","240481701_A_Probabilistic_Proof_of_an_Asymptotic_Formula_for_the_Number_of_Labelled_Regular_Graphs","237128281_Thresholds_for_colourability_and_satisfiability_in_random_graphs_and_Boolean_formulae","235929805_Information_Physics_and_Computation","228057712_On_random_graphs_I","226305459_Colouring_random_graphs","222837360_Almost_all_graphs_with_degree_4_are_3-colorable","222299025_Counting_connected_graphs_inside-out","221590896_The_threshold_for_random_k-SAT_is_2k_ln2_-_Ok","221498230_A_Dichotomy_Theorem_for_the_Resolution_Complexity_of_Random_Constraint_Satisfaction_Problems","220618331_The_Resolution_Complexity_of_Random_Constraint_Satisfaction_Problems","220345750_On_the_Solution-Space_Geometry_of_Random_Constraint_Satisfaction_Problems","220345350_Cores_in_random_hypergraphs_and_Boolean_formulas","45928146_On_Belief_Propagation_Guided_Decimation_for_Random_k-SAT","24013920_A_better_algorithm_for_random_k-SAT","23740087_Almost_All_Graphs_of_Degree_4_are_3-colorable","8128509_Threshold_values_stability_analysis_and_high-q_asymptotics_for_the_coloring_problem_on_random_graphs","4294367_Reconstruction_for_Models_on_Random_Graphs","4004028_The_3-XORSAT_threshold","3728255_Analysis_of_a_list-coloring_algorithm_on_a_random_graph","2869225_The_Two_Possible_Values_of_the_Chromatic_Number_of_a_Random_Graph","2400065_A_Sharp_Threshold_for_k-Colorability","1915177_Algorithmic_Barriers_from_Phase_Transitions","1912380_Reconstruction_of_Random_Colourings","1848720_Reconstruction_on_Trees_and_Spin_Glass_Transition","1763745_Constraint_optimization_and_landscapes","1890418_On_the_Freezing_of_Variables_in_Random_Constraint_Satisfaction_Problems","1887727_Reconstruction_for_Models_on_Random_Graphs","1846070_On_the_Dynamics_of_the_Glass_Transition_on_Bethe_Lattices"]}
