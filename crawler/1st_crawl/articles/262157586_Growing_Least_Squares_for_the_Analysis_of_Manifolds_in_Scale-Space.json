{"id":"262157586_Growing_Least_Squares_for_the_Analysis_of_Manifolds_in_Scale-Space","abstract":"We present a novel approach to the multi-scale analysis of point-sampled manifolds of co-dimension 1. It is based on a variant of Moving Least Squares, whereby the evolution of a geometric descriptor at increasing scales is used to locate pertinent locations in scale-space, hence the name “Growing Least Squares”. Compared to existing scale-space analysis methods, our approach is the first to provide a continuous solution in space and scale dimensions, without requiring any parametrization, connectivity or uniform sampling. An important implication is that we identify multiple pertinent scales for any point on a manifold, a property that had not yet been demonstrated in the literature. In practice, our approach exhibits an improved robustness to change of input, and is easily implemented in a parallel fashion on the GPU. We compare our method to state-of-the-art scale-space analysis techniques and illustrate its practical relevance in a few application scenarios. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","authors":["Nicolas Mellado","Gaël Guennebaud","Pascal Barla","Patrick Reuter"],"meta":["August 2012Computer Graphics Forum 31(5):1691-1701","DOI:10.1111/j.1467-8659.2012.03174.x"],"references":["279396794_Scale-Space_Theory_in_Computer_Vision","279369202_Scale-Space_Theory_in_Computer_Vision","341348923_Computational_Vision_Information_Processing_in_Perception_and_Visual_Behavior","316588757_A_Wavelet_Tour_of_Signal_Processing","308721377_Computational_Vision_Information_Processing_in_Perception_and_Visual_Behavior","292732187_Surface_partial_matching_application_to_archaeology","291179102_The_Laplacian_Pyramid_as_a_Compact_Image_Code","286341249_Spectral_mesh_processing","279354845_Scale-Space_Theory_in_Computer_Vision","275046425_Scale-Space_Filtering"]}
