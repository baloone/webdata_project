We trained an algorithm with 220,680 images of 174 disorders and validated it using Edinburgh (1,300 images; 10 disorders) and SNU datasets (2,201 images; 134 disorders). The algorithm could accurately predict malignancy, suggest primary treatment options, render multi-class classification among 134 disorders, and improve the performance of medical professionals. The area under the curves for malignancy detection were 0.928 ± 0.002 (Edinburgh) and 0.937 ± 0.004 (SNU). The area under the curves of primary treatment suggestion (SNU) were 0.828 ± 0.012, 0.885 ± 0.006, 0.885 ± 0.006, and 0.918 ± 0.006 for steroids, antibiotics, antivirals, and antifungals, respectively. For multi-class classification, the mean top-1 and top-5 accuracies were 56.7 ± 1.6% and 92.0 ± 1.1% (Edinburgh) and 44.8 ± 1.2% and 78.1 ± 0.3% (SNU), respectively. With the assistance of our algorithm, the sensitivity and specificity of 47 clinicians (21 dermatologists and 26 dermatology residents) for malignancy prediction (SNU; 240 images) were improved by 12.1% (P < 0.0001) and 1.1% (P < 0.0001), respectively. The malignancy prediction sensitivity of 23 non-medical professionals was significantly increased by 83.8% (P < 0.0001). The top-1 and top-3 accuracies of four doctors in the multi-class classification of 134 diseases (SNU; 2,201 images) were increased by 7.0% (P = 0.045) and 10.1% (P = 0.0020), respectively. The results suggest that our algorithm may serve as augmented intelligence that can empower medical professionals in diagnostic dermatology.","authors":["Seung Seog Han","Ilwoo Park","Sung Eun Chang","Woohyung Lim"],"meta":["March 2020Journal of Investigative Dermatology 140(9)","DOI:10.1016/j.jid.2020.01.019"],"references":["335161001_Systematic_outperformance_of_112_dermatologists_in_multiclass_skin_cancer_image_classification_by_convolutional_neural_networks","333725805_Comparison_of_the_accuracy_of_human_readers_versus_machine-learning_algorithms_for_pigmented_skin_lesion_classification_an_open_web-based_international_diagnostic_study","331594199_A_convolutional_neural_network_trained_with_dermoscopic_images_performed_on_par_with_145_dermatologists_in_a_clinical_melanoma_image_classification_task","329078287_Deep_learning_for_chest_radiograph_diagnosis_A_retrospective_comparison_of_the_CheXNeXt_algorithm_to_practicing_radiologists","328346240_Skin_Cancer_Classification_Using_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_Systematic_Review","327539277_Skin_Cancer_Classification_using_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_Systematic_Review_Preprint","326996103_Clinically_applicable_deep_learning_for_diagnosis_and_referral_in_retinal_disease","325524774_Automated_Dermatological_Diagnosis_Hype_or_Reality","325473733_Man_against_Machine_Diagnostic_performance_of_a_deep_learning_convolutional_neural_network_for_dermoscopic_melanoma_recognition_in_comparison_to_58_dermatologists","324381190_7-Point_Checklist_and_Skin_Lesion_Classification_using_Multi-Task_Multi-Modal_Neural_Nets","324078202_The_HAM10000_Dataset_A_Large_Collection_of_Multi-Source_Dermatoscopic_Images_of_Common_Pigmented_Skin_Lesions","323624159_Acral_melanoma_detection_using_a_convolutional_neural_network_for_dermoscopy_images","322621180_Deep_neural_networks_show_an_equivalent_and_often_superior_performance_to_dermatologists_in_onychomycosis_diagnosis_Automatic_construction_of_onychomycosis_datasets_by_region-based_convolutional_deep_","303498772_Deep_learning_as_a_tool_for_increased_accuracy_and_efficiency_of_histopathological_diagnosis","265295439_ImageNet_Large_Scale_Visual_Recognition_Challenge","264979485_Caffe_Convolutional_Architecture_for_Fast_Feature_Embedding","335408336_Dermatologist-level_classification_of_malignant_lip_diseases_using_a_deep_convolutional_neural_network","330203267_High-performance_medicine_the_convergence_of_human_and_artificial_intelligence","329260679_Expert-Level_Diagnosis_of_Nonpigmented_Skin_Cancer_by_Combined_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","328241386_Deep_learning_algorithms_for_detection_of_critical_findings_in_head_CT_scans_a_retrospective_study","327990993_Automated_Classification_of_Skin_Lesions_From_Pixels_to_Practice","326049818_Deep_learning-based_computer-aided_classifier_developed_with_a_small_dataset_of_clinical_images_surpasses_board-certified_dermatologists_in_skin_tumor_diagnosis","325771219_Deep_learning-based_computer-aided_classifier_developed_with_a_small_dataset_of_clinical_images_surpasses_board-certified_dermatologists_in_skin_tumor_diagnosis","325516049_Skin_lesion_analysis_toward_melanoma_detection_A_challenge_at_the_2017_International_symposium_on_biomedical_imaging_ISBI_hosted_by_the_international_skin_imaging_collaboration_ISIC","323062342_Classification_of_the_Clinical_Images_for_Benign_and_Malignant_Cutaneous_Tumors_Using_a_Deep_Learning_Algorithm","321107128_The_Impact_of_Quantitative_Data_Provided_by_a_Multi-spectral_Digital_Skin_Lesion_Analysis_Device_on_Dermatologists'Decisions_to_Biopsy_Pigmented_Lesions","319770272_Delving_Deep_into_Rectifiers_Surpassing_Human-Level_Performance_on_ImageNet_Classification","319501512_Squeeze-and-Excitation_Networks","316779633_A_Study_and_Comparison_of_Human_and_Deep_Learning_Recognition_Performance_Under_Visual_Distortions","312890808_Dermatologist-level_classification_of_skin_cancer_with_deep_neural_networks","311164170_Development_and_Validation_of_a_Deep_Learning_Algorithm_for_Detection_of_Diabetic_Retinopathy_in_Retinal_Fundus_Photographs","276421885_MED-NODE_A_Computer-Assisted_Melanoma_Diagnosis_System_using_Non-Dermoscopic_Images","272027131_Delving_Deep_into_Rectifiers_Surpassing_Human-Level_Performance_on_ImageNet_Classification","265385906_Very_Deep_Convolutional_Networks_for_Large-Scale_Image_Recognition"]}
