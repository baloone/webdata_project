It can be done using a classifier to output the probability of link formation between nodes. Recently several works have used neural networks to create node representations which allow rich inputs to neural classifiers. Preliminary works were done on this and report promising results. However they did not use realistic settings like time-slicing, evaluate performances with comprehensive metrics or explain when or why neural network methods outperform. We investigated how inputs from four node representation algorithms affect performance of a neural link predictor on random- and time-sliced biomedical graphs of real-world sizes (∼ 6 million edges) containing information relevant to DTI, PPI and LBD. We compared the performance of the neural link predictor to those of established baselines and report performance across five metrics.\n\nResults: \nIn random- and time-sliced experiments when the neural network methods were able to learn good node representations and there was a negligible amount of disconnected nodes, those approaches outperformed the baselines. In the smallest graph (∼ 15,000 edges) and in larger graphs with approximately 14% disconnected nodes, baselines such as Common Neighbours proved a justifiable choice for link prediction. At low recall levels (∼ 0.3) the approaches were mostly equal, but at higher recall levels across all nodes and average performance at individual nodes, neural network approaches were superior. Analysis showed that neural network methods performed well on links between nodes with no previous common neighbours; potentially the most interesting links. Additionally, while neural network methods benefit from large amounts of data, they require considerable amounts of computational resources to utilise them.\n\nConclusions: \nOur results indicate that when there is enough data for the neural network methods to use and there are a negligible amount of disconnected nodes, those approaches outperform the baselines. At low recall levels the approaches are mostly equal but at higher recall levels and average performance at individual nodes, neural network approaches are superior. Performance at nodes without common neighbours which indicate more unexpected and perhaps more useful links account for this.","authors":["Gamal Crichton","Yufan Guo Guo","Sampo Pyysalo","Anna Korhonen"],"meta":["May 2018BMC Bioinformatics 19(1)","DOI:10.1186/s12859-018-2163-9"],"references":["316780438_Graph_Embedding_Techniques_Applications_and_Performance_A_Survey","312519243_Link_prediction_in_drug-target_interactions_network_using_similarity_indices","311704001_The_BioGRID_interaction_database_2017_update","310825144_Asymmetric_Transitivity_Preserving_Graph_Embedding","305386496_Scikit-Iearn_Machine_learning_in_python","319770439_Efficient_Estimation_of_Word_Representations_in_Vector_Space","310824980_Structural_Deep_Network_Embedding","305997704_node2vec_Scalable_Feature_Learning_for_Networks","305482636_Link_Prediction_on_a_Network_of_Co-occurring_MeSH_Terms_Towards_Literature-based_Discovery","301233236_Clustering_and_preferential_attachment_in_growing_networks"]}
