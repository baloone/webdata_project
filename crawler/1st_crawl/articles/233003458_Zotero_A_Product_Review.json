Zotero: The Next-Generation Research Tool. 2009. Available: <http://www.zotero.org/>. Accessed: May 13, 2009 . View all references Zotero automatically imports citation information from a number of sources, including nonsubscription, newspaper, and commercial Web sites, and Web-based databases such as PubMed and MedlinePlus. Zotero offers more options for note taking than the better-known citation management system EndNote. Sixteen citation styles are available when Zotero is initially downloaded, with many more freely available. Users can install a plug-in that allows Zotero to integrate with Microsoft Word. Even though Zotero does not have an on-demand customer support service, its Web site offers a wealth of information for users. The authors highly recommend Zotero.","authors":["Jessica Trinoskey","Frances A Brahmi","Carole Gall"],"meta":["July 2009Journal of Electronic Resources in Medical Libraries 6(3):224-229","DOI:10.1080/15424060903167229"],"references":["290448128_Is_United_States'_whaling_policy_what_the_public_wants","233735622_Abrupt_recent_shift_in_d13C_and_d15N_values_in_Adelie_penguin_eggshell_in_Antarctica","51375757_Urgent_Need_for_Empirical_Research_into_Whaling_and_Whale_Watching","8349337_Retrieval_comparison_of_EndNote_to_search_MEDLINE_Ovid_and_PubMed_versus_searching_them_directly","6743353_Morphological_Specializations_of_baleen_whales_associated_with_hydrodynamic_performance_and_ecological_niche","6152331_Increasing_abundance_of_bowhead_whales_in_West_Greenland","324323878_In_the_Heart_of_the_Sea_The_Tragedy_of_the_Whaleship_Essex","324292806_Japanese_Whaling_The_End_of_an_Era","298988090_Product_pipeline","298564125_Whales_whaling_and_ocean_ecosystems","293789970_References_to_go","279408133_Zotero","278402900_Scientific_Whaling","275865566_US-Japan_Whaling_Accord_Still_in_Dispute","275695076_Hellships_Yankee_Whaling_along_the_Coasts_of_Russian-America_1835-1852","274851929_On_the_Northwest_Commercial_Whaling_in_the_Pacific_Northwest_1790-1967","274687615_Ahab's_Trade_The_Saga_of_South_Seas_Whaling","271689029_Transnational_Resource_Conflict_The_Politics_of_Whaling","270380825_Between_the_Lines_The_Whaling_Commission_Flounders","270045831_A_Whale_of_an_Inquiry","242824026_Patterns_of_Journal_Use_by_Faculty_at_Three_Diverse_Universities","14594214_Bibliography_database_managers_A_comparative_review","7080818_Modeling_the_past_and_future_of_whales_and_whaling","6957491_It's_not_just_poor_science_-_Japan's_scientific_whaling_may_be_a_human_health_risk_too","6823273_Nuclear_and_mitochondrial_markers_reveal_distinctiveness_of_a_small_population_of_bottlenose_whales_Hyperoodon_ampullatus_in_the_western_North_Atlantic","6760248_Halogenated_organic_compounds_in_archived_whale_oil_A_pre-industrial_record","6698657_Marine_Mammal_Neoplasia_A_Review","6651368_Killer_whales_and_whaling_The_scavenging_hypothesis","6455177_Japanese_whaling_and_other_cetacean_fisheries","6317013_Stomach_anatomy_and_use_in_defining_systemic_relationships_of_the_Cetacean_family_Ziphiidae_Beaked_whales","6279464_Conservation_biology_Whales_mostly_win_at_Whaling_Commission_meeting","6274868_Genetic_variation_in_Holocene_bowhead_whales_from_Svalbard","6240710_Whaling_Will_the_Phoenix_rise_again","6199528_Canadian_dispatches_from_medical_fronts_Whaling","6167321_Foodways_on_two_colonial_whaling_stations_archaeological_and_historical_evidence_for_diet_in_nineteenth-century_Tasmania","5952871_How_few_whales_were_there_after_whaling_Inference_from_contemporary_mtDNA_diversity","5612297_Dismay_at_Japan's_new_whaling_targets","4855961_The_British_Whaling_Trade_Research_in_Maritime_History_Number_29_By_Gordon_Jackson_St_John's_NL_International_Maritime_Economic_History_Association_2005_Pp_xvi_293_Free_to_members_of_the_association_1"]}
