{"id":"345657583_A_generalized_gravity_model_for_influential_spreaders_identification_in_complex_networks","abstract":"How to iden­tify in­flu­en­tial spread­ers in com­plex net­works is still an open is­sue in net­work sci­ence. Many ap­proaches from dif­fer­ent per­spec­tives have been pro­posed to iden­tify vi­tal nodes in com­plex net­works. In these mod­els, grav­ity model is an ef­fec­tive model to find vi­tal nodes based on lo­cal in­for­ma­tion and path in­for­ma­tion. How­ever, grav­ity model just uses de­gree of the node to judge lo­cal in­for­ma­tion, which is not pre­cise. To ad­dress this is­sue, a gen­er­al­ized grav­ity model is pro­posed in this pa­per. Gen­er­al­ized grav­ity model mea­sures lo­cal in­for­ma­tion from both lo­cal clus­tering co­ef­fi­cient and de­gree of each node, which is more com­pre­hen­sive. Also, pa­ra­me­ter α can be mod­i­fied in dif­fer­ent ap­pli­ca­tions to get bet­ter per­for­mance. Gen­er­al­ized grav­ity model can de­gen­er­ate into grav­ity model when α = 0. Promis­ing re­sults from ex­per­i­ments on four real-world net­works demon­strate the ef­fec­tive­ness of the pro­posed method.","authors":["Hanwen Li","Qiuyan Shang","Yong Deng"],"meta":["February 2021Chaos Solitons & Fractals 143:110456","DOI:10.1016/j.chaos.2020.110456"],"references":["341649641_Uncertainty_Modelling_in_Multi-agent_Information_Fusion_Systems","341627061_Finding_key_players_in_complex_networks_through_deep_reinforcement_learning","339026566_Recovering_Network_Structures_Based_on_Evolutionary_Game_Dynamics_Via_Secure_Dimensional_Reduction","339002919_The_Pseudo-Pascal_Triangle_of_Maximum_Deng_Entropy","338704769_A_new_method_to_predict_the_interference_effect_in_quantum-like_Bayesian_networks","338437677_An_Efficient_Network_Method_for_Time_Series_Forecasting_Based_on_the_DC_Algorithm_and_Visibility_Relation","334287614_A_Fast_Algorithm_for_Network_Forecasting_Time_Series","333686362_Identifying_influential_spreaders_by_gravity_model","331881488_Network-based_prediction_of_protein_interactions","325272232_ProfitLeader_identifying_leaders_in_networks_with_profit_capacity","323142106_Targeted_Damage_to_Interdependent_Networks","350549202_DCM_D_Number_Extended_Cognitive_Map_Application_on_Location_Selection_in_SCM","346889377_Uncertainty_measure_in_evidence_theory","344969989_Complex_Network_Modeling_of_Evidence_Theory","344649136_Self-referential_Boltzmann_machine","340867106_A_new_financial_data_forecasting_model_using_genetic_algorithm_and_long_short-term_memory_network","340355702_Identifying_influential_nodes_in_complex_networks_from_global_perspective","339789811_Vital_spreaders_identification_in_complex_networks_with_multi-local_dimension","339694641_Alternatives_selection_for_produced_water_management_A_network-based_methodology","339500309_Risk_Assessment_of_an_Electrical_Power_System_Considering_the_Influence_of_Traffic_Congestion_on_a_Hypothetical_Scenario_of_Electrified_Transportation_System_in_New_York_State","339247364_Resilience_centrality_in_complex_networks","339220293_Dismantling_and_Vertex_Cover_of_Network_Through_Message_Passing","338970999_Functional_immunization_of_networks_based_on_message_passing","338917916_Finding_influential_nodes_in_social_networks_based_on_neighborhood_correlation_coefficient","338800599_The_exposome_and_health_Where_chemistry_meets_biology","338563886_Determine_the_Number_of_Unknown_Targets_in_Open_World_Based_on_Elbow_Method","338511298_GMM_A_generalized_mechanics_model_for_identifying_the_importance_of_nodes_in_complex_networks","338409692_A_box-covering_Tsallis_information_dimension_and_non-extensive_property_of_complex_networks","337070627_Ability-based_evolution_promotes_cooperation_in_interdependent_graphs","336634228_Universal_behavior_of_cascading_failures_in_interdependent_networks","336444824_Passive_network_evolution_promotes_group_welfare_in_complex_networks","336283805_Identification_of_influencers_in_complex_networks_by_local_information_dimensionality","335969050_Identification_of_influential_users_in_Social_Network_Using_Grey_Wolf_Optimization_Algorithm","335532065_Non-backtracking_PageRank_From_the_classic_model_to_hashimoto_matrices","334757439_Spectra_of_networks_containing_short_loops","334715226_Estimating_Node_Importance_in_Knowledge_Graphs_Using_Graph_Neural_Networks","334326707_Computational_socioeconomics","333947334_Node_similarity_measuring_in_complex_networks_with_relative_entropy","333406134_Co-Ranking_for_nodes_layers_and_timestamps_in_multilayer_temporal_networks","333358499_A_Novel_Z_-Network_Model_Based_on_Bayesian_Network_and_Z_-Number","332716320_A_bio-inspired_optimal_network_division_method","329455366_Virus_Propagation_and_Patch_Distribution_in_Multiplex_Networks_Modeling_Analysis_and_Optimal_Allocation","329171476_Influential_node_ranking_in_social_networks_based_on_neighborhood_diversity","328482070_Analysis_of_Epidemic_Spreading_Process_in_Adaptive_Networks","328439762_On_Rich_Clubs_of_Path-Based_Centralities_in_Networks","327165409_Boltzmann_Machine_With_Self-Referential_Entropy","324643700_Visibility_Graphs_for_Image_Processing","323884200_A_new_centrality_measure_based_on_the_negative_and_positive_effects_of_clustering_coefficient_for_identifying_influential_spreaders_in_complex_networks","323880501_Network-based_prediction_of_protein_interactions","322882705_Measuring_the_vulnerability_of_community_structure_in_complex_networks","318981472_Complex_network_view_of_evolving_manifolds","313845332_Non-backtracking_expansion_of_finite_graphs","320767616_Influential_nodes_ranking_in_complex_networks_An_entropy-based_approach","320185238_Quantifying_the_Resilience_of_Community_Structures_in_Networks","312572389_A_framework_and_Language_for_Complex_Adaptive_System_modeling_and_simulation"]}
