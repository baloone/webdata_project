{"id":"256416881_Complement_reducible_graphs","abstract":"In this paper we study the family of graphs which can be reduced to single vertices by recursively complementing all connected subgraphs. It is shown that these graphs can be uniquely represented by a tree where the leaves of the tree correspond to the vertices of the graph. From this tree representation we derive many new structural and algorithmic properties. Furthermore, it is shown that these graphs have arisen independently in various diverse areas of mathematics.","authors":["D.G. Corneil","H.
