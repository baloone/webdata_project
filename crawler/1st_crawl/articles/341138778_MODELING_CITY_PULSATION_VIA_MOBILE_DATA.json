{"id":"341138778_MODELING_CITY_PULSATION_VIA_MOBILE_DATA","abstract":"In this study, the mobile phone traces concern an ephemeral event which represents important densities of people. This research aims to study city pulse and human mobility evolution that would be arise during specific event (Armada festival), by modelling and simulating human mobility of the observed region, depending on CDRs (Call Detail Records) data. The most pivot questions of this research are: Why human mobility studied? What are the human life patterns in the observed region inside Rouen city during Armada festival? How life patterns and individuals' mobility could be extracted for this region from mobile DB (CDRs)? The radius of gyration parameter has been applied to elaborate human life patterns with regards to (work, off) days for the observed data.","authors":["Suhad Faisal","Cyrille Bertelle","Loay E.
