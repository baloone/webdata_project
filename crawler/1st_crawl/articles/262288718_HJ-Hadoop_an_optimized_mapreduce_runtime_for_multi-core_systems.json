{"id":"262288718_HJ-Hadoop_an_optimized_mapreduce_runtime_for_multi-core_systems","abstract":"We introduces HabaneroJava-Hadoop, an extension to the HadoopMapReduce system that is optimized for multi-core machines. HJ-Hadoop exploits intra-JVM parallelism that increases memory efficiency of each node. Results show a significant improvement in the amount of data each MapReduce job could process and load balance across cores for certain applications.","authors":["Yunming Zhang"],"meta":["October 2013","DOI:10.1145/2508075.2514875","Conference: Proceedings of the 2013 companion publication for conference on Systems, programming, & applications: software for humanity"],"references":["239761203_Habanero-Java_The_new_adventures_of_Old_X10"]}
