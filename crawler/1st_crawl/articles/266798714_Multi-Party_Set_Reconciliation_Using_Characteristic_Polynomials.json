{"id":"266798714_Multi-Party_Set_Reconciliation_Using_Characteristic_Polynomials","abstract":"In the standard set reconciliation problem, there are two parties $A_1$ and\n$A_2$, each respectively holding a set of elements $S_1$ and $S_2$. The goal is\nfor both parties to obtain the union $S_1 \\cup S_2$. In many distributed\ncomputing settings the sets may be large but the set difference\n$|S_1-S_2|+|S_2-S_1|$ is small. In these cases one aims to achieve\nreconciliation efficiently in terms of communication; ideally, the\ncommunication should depend on the size of the set difference, and not on the\nsize of the sets.\nRecent work has considered generalizations of the reconciliation problem to\nmulti-party settings, using a framework based on a specific type of linear\nsketch called an Invertible Bloom Lookup Table. Here, we consider multi-party\nset reconciliation using the alternative framework of characteristic\npolynomials, which have previously been used for efficient pairwise set\nreconciliation protocols, and compare their performance with Invertible Bloom\nLookup Tables for these problems.","authors":["Anudhyan Boral","Michael Mitzenmacher"],"meta":["October 2014","DOI:10.1109/ALLERTON.2014.7028589","SourcearXiv"],"references":["261170589_Invertible_Bloom_Lookup_Tables","258345914_Simple_Multi-Party_Set_Reconciliation","224168278_Straggler_Identification_in_Round-Trip_Data_Streams_via_Newton's_Identities_and_Invertible_Bloom_Filters","221347849_Fuzzy_Extractors_How_to_Generate_Strong_Keys_from_Biometrics_and_Other_Noisy_Data","220684172_Algebraic_gossip_A_network_coding_approach_to_optimal_multiple_rumor_mongering","220680099_Set_Reconciliation_with_Nearly_Optimal_Communication_Complexity","3084636_Set_Reconciliation_with_Nearly_Optimal_Communication_Complexity","260740100_The_complexity_of_object_reconciliation_and_open_problems_related_to_set_difference_and_coding","228057614_Analyzing_Network_Coding_Gossip_Made_Easy_simpler_proofs_for_stronger_results_even_in_adversarial_dynamic_networks","223618120_On_arithmetical_algorithms_over_finite_fields","221590231_Almost_tight_bounds_for_rumour_spreading_with_conductance","221164148_What's_the_Difference_Efficient_Set_Reconciliation_without_Prior_Context","220655055_Gossip_Algorithms","50274504_Tight_bounds_for_rumor_spreading_in_graphs_of_a_given_conductance","47278466_Analyzing_Network_Coding_Gossip_Made_Easy","30816210_Fast_Polynomial_Factorization_and_Modular_Composition","2451035_Subquadratic-Time_Factoring_of_Polynomials_over_Finite_Fields"]}
