{"id":"323621502_Topological_Sensitivity_for_Solving_Inverse_Multiple_Scattering_Problems_in_Three-Dimensional_Electromagnetism_Part_II_Iterative_Method","abstract":"In this work we study an iterative method based on the computation of iterated topological derivatives for the detection and shape identification of multiple electromagnetic scatterers. We derive closed-form formulae for the topological derivative when an approximate set of domains has already been set. Either Neumann, Dirichlet, impedance, or transmission conditions on the boundary of the scatterers are imposed. Proofs rely on the computation of shape derivatives followed by asymptotic expansions using Mie series derived from boundary integral formulations of the involved forward problems. Numerical results are included, illustrating the ability of the method to find shapes accurately without a priori information in a rather small number of iterations. © 2018 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics and by SIAM.","authors":["Frédérique Le Louër","Maria-Luisa Rapun"],"meta":["March 2018SIAM Journal on Imaging Sciences 11(1):734-769","DOI:10.1137/17M1148359"],"references":["323117935_A_spectrally_accurate_method_for_the_direct_and_inverse_scattering_problems_by_multiple_3D_dielectric_obstacles","280310042_Why_the_high-frequency_inverse_scattering_by_topological_sensitivity_may_work","269565483_Stability_and_Resolution_Analysis_of_Topological_Derivative_Based_Localization_of_Small_Electromagnetic_Inclusions","258275567_Hybrid_topological_derivative_and_gradient-based_methods_for_electrical_impedance_tomography","231089092_The_topological_asymptotic_expansion_for_the_Maxwell_equations_and_some_application","226778343_Bubble_method_for_topology_and_shape_optimization_of_structures","225171661_Boundary_Element_Methods_for_Maxwell_Transmission_Problems_in_Lipschitz_Domains","220259817_The_Topological_Asymptotic_for_PDE_Systems_The_Elasticity_Case","220259558_Stability_and_Resolution_Analysis_for_a_Topological_Derivative_Based_Imaging_Functional","220146054_Determining_Planar_Multiple_Sound-Soft_Obstacles_from_Scattered_Acoustic_Fields","286623442_Detection_of_Electromagnetic_Inclusions_Using_Topological_Sensitvity","273897868_Inverse_acoustic_scattering_by_solid_obstacles_topological_sensitivity_and_its_preliminary_application","265789163_A_study_on_the_topological_derivative-based_imaging_of_thin_electromagnetic_inhomogeneities_in_limited-aperture_problems","264459920_Spectrally_accurate_numerical_solution_of_hypersingular_boundary_integral_equations_for_three-dimensional_electromagnetic_wave_scattering_problems","263666148_Topological_sensitivity_analysis_for_the_modified_Helmholtz_equation_under_an_impedance_condition_on_the_boundary_of_a_hole","258681070_The_domain_derivative_of_time-harmonic_electromagnetic_waves_at_interfaces","246192858_Finite_Element_Methods_For_Maxwell's_Equations","243684944_Analysis_of_Radiative_Scattering_for_Multiple_Sphere_Configurations","231957099_Boundary_integral_equations_for_the_scattering_of_electromagnetic_waves_by_a_homogeneous_dielectric_obstacle","231127680_A_new_method_in_inverse_scattering_based_on_the_topological_derivative","222700824_A_high-order_tangential_basis_algorithm_for_electromagnetic_scattering_by_curved_surfaces","222698593_Generalized_topological_derivative_for_the_Navier_equation_and_inverse_scattering_in_the_time_domain","222677273_A_high-order_algorithm_for_obstacle_scattering_in_three_dimensions","222575738_Fast_identification_of_cracks_using_higher-order_topological_sensitivity_for_2-D_potential_problems","222557363_From_imaging_to_material_identification_A_generalized_concept_of_topological_sensitivity","220411709_A_Hybrid_High-Order_Algorithm_for_Radar_Cross_Section_Computations","220393561_A_high-order_algorithm_for_multiple_electromagnetic_scattering_in_three_dimensions","220222620_On_the_Frechet_Derivative_for_Obstacle_Scattering_with_an_Impedance_Boundary_Condition","220206715_Topological_derivative_strategy_for_one-step_iteration_imaging_of_arbitrary_shaped_thin_curve-like_electromagnetic_inclusions","220179524_Modified_Combined_Field_Integral_Equations_for_Electromagnetic_Scattering","29621276_Fast_non-iterative_methods_for_defect_identification","29617411_Topological_sensitivity_and_FMM-accelerated_BEM_applied_to_3D_acoustic_inverse_scattering","29608590_Higher-order_topological_sensitivity_for_2-D_potential_problems_Application_to_fast_identification_of_inclusions","3010796_A_boundary-element_solution_of_the_Leontovitch_problem"]}
