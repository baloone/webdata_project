{"id":"303529090_Combined_strength_of_holons_agents_and_function_blocks_in_cyber-physical_systems","abstract":"This paper presents a novel approach to implementing cyber-physical systems (CPS) using the combined strength of holons, agents and function blocks. Within the context, a CPS is represented by a holarchy of multiple holons. Each holon possesses a logical part and a physical part, which mimic the cyber and physical entities of the CPS. During implementation, the two parts of a holon are realised by agents and function blocks for information processing and materials processing, respectively. The objective of this research is to provide a concept map and associate a CPS with holons, agents and function blocks for the ease of system implementation in decentralised or cloud environment.","authors":["Lihui Wang","Azadeh Haghighi"],"meta":["May 2016Journal of Manufacturing Systems 40(2):25-34","DOI:10.1016/j.jmsy.2016.05.002"],"references":["277583468_Competences_for_Cyber-physical_Systems_in_Manufacturing_-_First_Findings_and_Scenarios","276152381_Current_status_and_advancement_of_cyber-physical_systems_in_manufacturing","269709304_A_Cyber-Physical_Systems_architecture_for_Industry_40-based_manufacturing_systems","263857376_Cyber-physical_Production_Systems_Roots_Expectations_and_RD_Challenges","228934884_A_Survey_of_Cyber_Physical_Systems","226808580_Holons_and_agents","222464513_Reference_architecture_for_holonic_manufacturing_systems_PROSA","221136664_Isolating_-_a_new_resampling_method_for_gene_order_data","220473317_Modeling_Cyber-Physical_Systems","4336650_Cyber_Physical_Systems_Design_Challenges","3453524_Distributed_Device_Networks_With_Security_Constraints","3421666_Agent-based_distributed_manufacturing_process_planning_and_scheduling_A_state-of-the-art_survey","2758651_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","313441382_Is_it_an_Agent_or_Just_a_Program_A_Taxonomy_for_Autonomous_Agents","284700410_Process_planning_and_control_in_a_holonic_manufacturing_environment","265790232_Knowledge-Based_Operation_Planning_and_Machine_Control_by_Function_Blocks_in_Web-DPP","263062853_Comparison_of_the_bionic_fractal_and_holonic_manufacturing_system_concepts","262311804_Realizing_holonic_control_with_function_blocks","257118962_A_review_of_function_blocks_for_process_planning_and_control_of_manufacturing_equipment","245331212_Function_block_design_for_adaptive_execution_control_of_job_shop_machining_operations","242934873_Wise-ShopFloor_A_Web-Based_and_Sensor-Driven_e-Shop_Floor","234125630_Programming_Industrial_Control_Systems_Using_Iec_1131-3_I_E_E_Control_Engineering_Series","233843050_The_control_of_myopic_behavior_in_semi-heterarchical_production_systems_A_holonic_framework","228889087_An_agent-oriented_architecture_for_holonic_manufacturing_control","223912464_Synthesis_of_Heterarchical_manufacturing_systems","223767298_A_Conceptual_Framework_for_Holonic_Manufacturing_Identification_of_Manufacturing_Holons","223713989_Evaluating_the_performance_of_reactive_control_architectures_for_manufacturing_production_control","223511053_Agent-Based_Distributed_Manufacturing_Control_A_State-of-the-Art_Survey","222658022_Applications_of_agent-based_systems_in_intelligent_manufacturing_An_updated_review","222639982_Distributed_control_of_production_systems","222609904_A_proposed_hierarchical_control_model_for_automated_manufacturing_systems","222567907_Agent-Based_Systems_for_Manufacturing","222443021_Holonic_manufacturing_scheduling_Architecture_cooperation_mechanism_and_implementation","222414120_ADACOR_A_holonic_architecture_for_agile_and_adaptive_manufacturing_control","222213724_An_architecture_for_metamorphic_control_of_holonic_manufacturing_systems","222073240_Designing_Holonic_manufacturing_systems","220774238_Holons_Agents_Recent_Developments_and_Mutual_Impacts","220327321_Agent_Technology_Foundations_Applications_and_Markets","220284005_Agent-Based_Systems_for_Intelligent_Manufacturing_A_State-of-the-Art_Survey","3766881_Agent-based_control_system_for_next_generation_manufacturing","3600612_Results_of_the_holonic_control_system_benchmark_at_KU_Leuven","3448920_STEP-NC_and_function_blocks_for_interoperable_manufacturing","3421938_Wise-ShopFloor_An_Integrated_Approach_for_Web-Based_Collaborative_Manufacturing"]}
