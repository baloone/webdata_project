{"id":"282439405_Mixed-Initiative_Planning_and_Execution_for_Multiple_Drones_in_Search_and_Rescue_Missions","abstract":"We present a mixed-initiative planning and execution system for human multi-drones interaction during search and rescue missions. The proposed system should allow a single operator to supervise and orchestrate the operations of a set of UAVs by means of a natural multimodal communication. In particular, we consider the task of searching for missing persons in a real-world alpine scenario. In this context, we assume that the human operator is an alpine rescuer, involved in the scene and co-located with the drones, hence not fully dedicated to the robotic platforms, but only able to provide sparse and sketchy interventions. This scenario requires a framework that supports adjustable autonomy, from explicit teleoperation to a complete autonomy, and an effective and natural mixed-initiative interaction between the human and the robotic team. In this paper, we illustrate the domain and the overall framework discussing the system at work in a simulated case study.","authors":["Giuseppe Bevacqua","Jonathan Cacace","Alberto Finzi","Vincenzo Lippiello"],"meta":["July 2015","Conference: ICAPS 2015At: Jerusalem, Israel","Project: SHERPA: SHERPA: Smart collaboration between Humans and ground-aERial robots for imProving rescuing activities in Alpine environments."],"references":["280830058_A_Mixed-Initiative_Control_System_for_an_Aerial_Service_Vehicle_Supported_by_Force_Feedback","271738101_Aerial_Service_Vehicles_for_Industrial_Inspection_Task_Decomposition_and_Plan_Execution","266654706_A_dialogue_system_for_multimodal_human-robot_interaction","264898248_Planning_the_Behaviour_of_Low-Cost_Quadcopters_for_Surveillance_Missions","261163465_The_SHERPA_project_Smart_collaboration_between_humans_and_ground-aerial_robots_for_improving_rescuing_activities_in_alpine_environments","242393198_Automation_Architecture_for_Single_Operator_Multiple_UAV_Command_and_Control","308299864_Incremental_Sampling-based_Algorithms_for_Optimal_Motion_Planning","301852921_Deliberation_and_its_Role_in_the_Formation_of_Intentions","261353157_An_extensible_architecture_for_robust_multimodal_human-robot_communication","246839317_Mixed-initiative_control_of_multiple_hetrogeneous_robots_for_urban_search_and_rescue"]}
