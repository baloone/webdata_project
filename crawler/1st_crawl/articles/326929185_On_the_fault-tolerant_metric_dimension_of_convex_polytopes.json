{"id":"326929185_On_the_fault-tolerant_metric_dimension_of_convex_polytopes","abstract":"A convex polytopes is a polytope that is also a convex set of points in the n-dimensional Euclidean space R‚Åø. By preserving the same adjacency relation between vertices of a convex polytope, its graph is constructed. The metric dimension problem has been extensively studied for convex polytopes and other families of graphs. In this paper, we study the fault-tolerant metric dimension problem for convex polytopes. By using a relation between resolving sets and fault-tolerant resolving sets of graphs, we prove that certain infinite families of convex polytopes are the families of graphs with constant fault-tolerant metric dimension. We conclude the paper with some open problems.","authors":["Hassan Raza","Sakander Hayat","Xiang-Feng Pan"],"meta":["December 2018Applied Mathematics and Computation 339:172-185","DOI:10.1016/j.amc.2018.07.010"],"references":["299547994_Computing_the_metric_dimension_of_convex_polytopes_generated_by_wheel_related_graphs","271010685_Computing_the_metric_dimension_of_wheel_related_graphs","265512082_Minimum_Fault-Tolerant_local_and_strong_metric_dimension_of_graphs","265368560_Families_of_plane_graphs_with_constant_metric_dimension","262723554_Labelings_of_two_classes_of_convex_polytopes","262490136_Computation_of_topological_indices_of_certain_networks","259573732_Fault-tolerance_in_resolvability","239920490_Fault-Tolerant_Metric_Dimension_of_Graphs","228641769_Base_size_metric_dimension_and_other_invariants_of_groups_and_graphs","220532702_On_the_Metric_Dimension_of_Cartesian_Products_of_Graphs","47501550_On_the_metric_dimension_of_Grassmann_graphs","1958724_Virtual_Coordinate_Backtracking_for_Void_Traversal_in_Geographic_Routing","320089137_Computing_distance-based_topological_descriptors_of_complex_chemical_networks_New_theoretical_techniques","319524869_On_the_sharp_lower_bounds_of_Zagreb_indices_of_graphs_with_given_number_of_cut_vertices","314104610_On_the_edge-version_atom-bond_connectivity_and_geometric_arithmetic_indices_of_certain_graph_operations_183","313097765_Sharp_upper_bounds_for_multiplicative_Zagreb_indices_of_bipartite_graphs_with_given_diameter","310671673_On_extremal_multiplicative_Zagreb_indices_of_trees_with_given_number_of_vertices_of_maximum_degree","303151748_Leaves_of_trees","267067206_The_theory_and_applications_of_resolvability_in_graphs_A_survey","265383803_On_topological_indices_of_certain_interconnection_networks","264960330_On_the_metric_dimension_of_a_graph","262723617_On_Magic_Labellings_of_Convex_Polytopes","257000702_On_the_Metric_Dimension_of_Infinite_Graphs","256936424_Minimal_doubly_resolving_sets_and_the_strong_metric_dimension_of_some_convex_polytopes","228057735_Computers_And_Intractability_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness","223400281_The_metric_dimension_of_Cayley_digraphs","223217500_Landmarks_in_graphs","222514864_Resolvability_in_graphs_and_the_metric_dimension_of_a_graph","220513592_On_families_of_convex_polytopes_with_constant_metric_dimension"]}
