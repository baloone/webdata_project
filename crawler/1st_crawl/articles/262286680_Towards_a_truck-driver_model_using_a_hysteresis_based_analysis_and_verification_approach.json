{"id":"262286680_Towards_a_truck-driver_model_using_a_hysteresis_based_analysis_and_verification_approach","abstract":"The complexity of human behaviors makes their modeling very difficult. To build a model that reproduce many concurrent aspects of those behaviors, we propose to use a test-driven like methodology. To validate this methodology, we reuse a car driver model and build a truck driver model by considering relevant aspects. We analyze, test and verify the model by using the hysteresis phenomena appearing in driver behaviors.","authors":["Lancelot Six","Zahia Guessoum","Julien Saunier","sio-song Ieng"],"meta":["May 2013","Conference: Proceedings of the 2013 international conference on Autonomous agents and multi-agent systems"],"references":["23961383_Errors_and_Artefacts_in_Agent-Based_Modelling","2527361_Towards_an_Emergence-Driven_Software_Process_For_Agent-Based_Simulation","239656941_A_critical_view_of_driver_behavior_models_What_do_we_know"]}
