{"id":"261226002_Rotation_Scaling_and_Deformation_Invariant_Scattering_for_Texture_Discrimination","abstract":"An affine invariant representation is constructed with a cascade of invariants, which preserves information for classification. A joint translation and rotation invariant representation of image patches is calculated with a scattering transform. It is implemented with a deep convolution network, which computes successive wavelet transforms and modulus non-linearities. Invariants to scaling, shearing and small deformations are calculated with linear operators in the scattering domain. State-of-the-art classification results are obtained over texture databases with uncontrolled viewing conditions.","authors":["Laurent Sifre","St√©phane Georges Mallat"],"meta":["June 2013Proceedings / CVPR, IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition.
