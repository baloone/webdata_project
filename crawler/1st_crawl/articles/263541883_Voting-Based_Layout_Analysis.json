{"id":"263541883_Voting-Based_Layout_Analysis","abstract":"As a part of the Computer Vision domain, layout analysis is the process through which the regions of interest from a document available as an image are being classified. A scanned file could be an example of such a document. The components of the layout analysis process are: the geometrical analysis and the logical layout.\nThe geometrical analysis involves the detection and labeling of differing regions or blocks of the image as being text, illustration, mathematic symbols, tables etc.\nThe logical layout refers to the detecting of the logical role that various regions have in the document (titles, footnotes, etc.).\nThe layout analysis process is intended to be performed before the document is sent or the OCR engine but it can also be used to identify copies of the same document or for indexing documents by structure. This paper presents an approach to analyze the layout based on a voting scheme, thus combining a series of algorithms and using weighted, majority and unanimous votes, with the purpose of increasing the accuracy of the results.","authors":["Costin-Anton Boiangiu","Paul Boglis","Georgiana Simion","Radu Ioanitescu"],"meta":["May 2014"],"references":["220814912_ANASTASIL_A_Hybrid_Knowledge-Based_System_for_Document_Layout_Analysis","3697694_A_Knowledge-Based_Approach_to_the_Layout_Analysis","2564797_High_Performance_Document_Layout_Analysis","2504221_Two_Geometric_Algorithms_for_Layout_Analysis","2329987_Turbo_Recognition_A_Statistical_Approach_to_Layout_Analysis","220181190_A_Fast_Algorithm_for_Bottom-Up_Document_Layout_Analysis","3192191_The_Document_Spectrum_for_Page_Layout_Analysis","2886240_On_the_Application_of_Voronoi_Diagrams_to_Page_Segmentation"]}
