{"id":"24062401_Principal_Component_Analysis_of_Three-mode_Data_by_Means_of_Alternating_Least_Squares_Algorithm","abstract":"A new method to estimate the parameters of Tucker's three-mode principal component model is discussed, and the convergence properties of the alternating least squares algorithm to solve the estimation problem are considered. A special case of the general Tucker model, in which the principal component analysis is only performed over two of the three modes is briefly outlined as well. The Miller & Nicely data on the confusion of English consonants are used to illustrate the programs TUCKALS3 and TUCKALS2 which incorporate the algorithms for the two models described.","authors":["Pieter Marinus Kroonenberg","Jan de Leeuw"],"meta":["March 1980Psychometrika 45(1):69-97","DOI:10.1007/BF02293599","SourceRePEc","Project: Three-mode data analysis: Theory and examples"],"references":["263278426_TUCKALS2_A_principal_component_analysis_of_three-mode_data","324626520_The_Measurement_of_Meaning","285969208_Three-way_or_second_order_component_analysis","285519713_Implications_of_factor_analysis_of_three-way_matrices_for_measurement_of_change","265330420_Solution_of_Equations_and_Systems_of_Equations","250955690_The_Validity_of_a_Family_of_Optimization_Methods","247875728_Extension_of_factor_analysis_to_three-dimensional_matrices","247726091_A_Revised_Fortran_IV_Program_for_Three-Mode_Factor_Analysis","247725118_An_IBM_709_Program_for_Factor_Analyzing_Three-Mode_Matrices","242781180_Foundations_of_the_PARAFAC_procedure_Model_and_conditions_for_an''explanatory''multi-mode_factor_analysis","239643748_An_INDSCAL_Analysis_of_the_Miller-Nicely_Consonant_Confusion_Data","239386717_An_Analysis_of_Perceptual_Among_Some_English_Consonants","238833753_Numerik_Symmetrischer_Matrizen","231891143_On_Best_Approximate_Solutions_of_Linear_Matrix_Equations","230112958_SOME_HIERARCHICAL_SCALING_METHODS_FOR_CONFUSION_MATRIX_ANALYSIS_II_APPLICATIONS_TO_LARGE_MATRICES"]}
