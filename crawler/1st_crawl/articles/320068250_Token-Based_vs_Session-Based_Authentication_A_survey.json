{"id":"320068250_Token-Based_vs_Session-Based_Authentication_A_survey","abstract":"In almost every service which has sensitive data of clients and which are very sensitive to them, security and privacy of their data is the key of happiness to them. This means that no other unauthorized person could get access to that data no matter what happens and why. In terms of computer science this has to do with authentication, it validates if a user it is who is declared it is. There are a lot of authentication techniques which were used over the years. Most of systems use cookies and session based authentication which overlap the servers because are statefull, remember all the login of the clients, in this paper I will discuss and analyze briefly the importance of new technique Token-Based Authentication proposed by OAuth 2.0 Framework, which is secure and most of all stateless. The way this technique works, comparison to old technique such as session-based authentication and most of all why to choose this technique above session-based technique are the main keys in this paper.","authors":["Yjvesa Balaj"],"meta":["September 2017","Project: A Survey: Token-Based vs Session-Based Authentication"],"references":["310436098_Authentication_system_for_stateless_RESTful_Web_service","232760840_User_Acceptance_of_Token_based_Authentication_by_Single_Sign-On","308867932_A_Token-Based_User_Authentication_Mechanism_for_Data_Exchange_in_RESTful_API","277879030_AAA_Authorization_Framework","243775092_Authentication_From_Passwords_to_Public_keys","3419385_Access_control_and_session_management_in_the_HTTP_environment"]}
