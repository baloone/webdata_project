{"id":"339625163_Technology-Enhanced_Learning_for_Graduate_Students_Exploring_the_Correlation_of_Media_Richness_and_Creativity_of_Computer-Mediated_Communication_and_Face-to-Face_Communication","abstract":"The objective of the research was to explore and compare the differences in potential creative thinking that media richness had on learners in creativity training through two different types of communication formats; computer-mediated communication, and face-to-face communication. The results indicated that the computer-mediated communication format performed better than the face-to-face in terms of the fluency, flexibility, and originality dimensions of creative thinking. The computer-mediated communication format also had a greater level of media richness perception (i.e., use of multiple cues, language diversity, and personal focus of the medium) than the face-to-face format. In terms of the combined effectiveness of computer-mediated communication, and face-to-face formats, the use of multiple cues, language variety of perception of media richness had direct effects on the fluency of creativity. There was also a positive correlation between the elaboration of creativity and the use of multiple cues, language variety, and personal focus of the medium in the perception of media richness. Furthermore, language variety was correlated with creativity and flexibility. The research findings highlighted the importance of the availability of immediate feedback on media richness, whereas creativity cognition should focus on the breadth and depth of the information, which contributes to enhancing the creativity of individuals or a group of employees.","authors":["Shan-Hui Chao","Jinzhang Jiang","Chia-Hsuan Hsu","Yi-Te Chiang"],"meta":["February 2020Applied Sciences 10(5):1602","DOI:10.3390/app10051602"],"references":["338545145_Language_learning_in_complex_virtual_worlds_Effects_of_modality_and_task_complexity_on_oral_performance_between_virtual_world_and_face-to-face_tasks","335609020_The_Impact_of_Knowledge_Sharing_and_Innovation_on_Sustainable_Performance_in_Islamic_Banks_A_Mediation_Analysis_through_a_SEM_Approach","335117907_Does_the_Frequency_of_Using_Emoticons_in_Computer-Mediated_Communication_Signal_Creativity","334709876_The_Impact_of_Knowledge_Sharing_and_Innovation_upon_Sustainable_Performance_in_Islamic_Banks_A_Mediation_Analysis_through_an_SEM_Approach","333312889_A_Systematic_Review_of_the_Use_of_Agile_Methodologies_in_Education_to_Foster_Sustainability_Competencies","332807644_Openness_to_Experience_and_Team_Creativity_Effects_of_Knowledge_Sharing_and_Transformational_Leadership","334423368_Analysis_of_Implementing_Hybrid_Teaching_in_International_Cruise_Talents_Education_Illustrated_by_ESP_Teaching","333675115_Transforming_Feedback_An_Application_Framework_for_Group_Feedback_Videos_in_Design","333519264_Novel_and_practical_idea_generation_Consumer-to-consumer_interactive_behaviors_and_brand_knowledge","332699358_Revisiting_media_richness_theory_for_today_and_future"]}
