{"id":"311751207_Interdisciplinarity_and_the_21st_century_research-intensive_university","abstract":"Modern universities were invented in Europe in the 18th century with an emphasis on research, the provision of high level education to each student, the unity between research and teaching, equality in status for each discipline, and academic freedom. This system led to remarkable scientific, technical, cultural, and societal progress. To manage the expansion of science, academic institutions organised into academic disciplines, which became sophisticated social systems to produce new knowledge. Academic institutions have remained organised along disciplinary lines but both societal needs and the evolution of science require rethinking the creation of knowledge. One way forward is the development of interdisciplinary collaborations whereby\ndisciplines work together to answer research questions and improve understanding of pressing problems in complement to disciplinary research.","authors":["Didier Wernli","Frédéric Darbellay"],"meta":["December 2016","DOI:10.13140/RG.2.2.21578.16321","Affiliation: League of European Research Universities"],"references":["317381003_Enhancing_Communication_and_Collaboration_in_Interdisciplinary_Research","290579354_Research_Skills_for_the_Future_An_Interdisciplinary_Perspective","348694408_From_Knowledge_to_Wisdom_A_Revolution_in_the_Aims_and_Methods_of_Science","344474086_Interdisciplinary_Research_Journeys_Practical_Strategies_for_Capturing_Creativity","331541254_The_Butterfly_Defect_How_Globalization_Creates_Systemic_Risks_and_What_to_Do_about_It","292163259_Organizing_enlightenment_Information_overload_and_the_invention_of_the_modern_research_university","290230347_Undisciplining_knowledge_Interdisciplinarity_in_the_twentieth_century","285650427_L'epistemologie_des_relations_interdisciplinaires","284502093_A_taxonomy_of_interdisciplinarity","282043946_Interdisciplinarity_How_to_catalyse_collaboration"]}
