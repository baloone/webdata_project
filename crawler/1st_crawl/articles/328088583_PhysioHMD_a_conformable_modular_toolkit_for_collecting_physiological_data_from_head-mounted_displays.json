{"id":"328088583_PhysioHMD_a_conformable_modular_toolkit_for_collecting_physiological_data_from_head-mounted_displays","abstract":"Virtual and augmented reality headsets are unique as they have access to our facial area: an area that presents an excellent opportunity for always-available input and insight into the user's state. Their position on the face makes it possible to capture bio-signals as well as facial expressions. This paper introduces the PhysioHMD, a software and hardware modular interface built for collecting affect and physiological data from users wearing a head-mounted display. The PhysioHMD platform is a flexible architecture enables researchers and developers to aggregate and interprets signals in real-time, and use those to develop novel, personalized interactions and evaluate virtual experiences. Offering an interface that is not only easy to extend but also is complemented by a suite of tools for testing and analysis. We hope that PhysioHMD can become a universal, publicly available testbed for VR and AR researchers.","authors":["Guillermo Bernal","Tao Yang","Abhinandan Jain","Pattie Maes"],"meta":["October 2018","DOI:10.1145/3267242.3267268","Conference: the 2018 ACM International Symposium"],"references":["322250395_Matching_Your_Face_or_Appraising_the_Situation_Two_Paths_to_Emotional_Contagion","308844308_Reduced_Mimicry_to_Virtual_Reality_Avatars_in_Autism_Spectrum_Disorder","265609953_Emergence_of_Virtual_Reality_as_a_Tool_for_Upper_Limb_Rehabilitation","233813324_PINTER_interactive_storytelling_with_physiological_input","227396252_Virtual_Reality_for_Stroke_Rehabilitation","51627597_Virtual_Reality_for_Stroke_Rehabilitation","7141557_Feasibility_Motivation_and_Selective_Motor_Control_Virtual_Reality_Compared_to_Conventional_Home_Exercise_in_Children_with_Cerebral_Palsy","2365526_Toward_Machine_Emotional_Intelligence_Analysis_of_Affective_Physiological_State","320575610_CollaVR_Collaborative_In-Headset_Review_for_VR_Video","319250372_Virtual_reality's_missing_element_Other_people","317043734_Multi-Device_Storyboards_for_Cinematic_Narratives_in_VR","316615308_Emotional_Beasts_Visually_Expressing_Emotions_through_Avatars_in_VR","315852785_Recognition_and_mapping_of_facial_expressions_to_avatar_by_embedded_photo_reflective_sensors_in_head_mounted_display","311362324_When_Does_Virtual_Embodiment_Change_Our_Minds","302073607_PsychicVR_Increasing_mindfulness_by_using_Virtual_Reality_and_Brain_Computer_Interfaces","286794765_Dropout_A_Simple_Way_to_Prevent_Neural_Networks_from_Overfitting","286594438_Large-Scale_Video_Classification_with_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","284793178_What_are_emotions_And_how_can_they_be_measured","282609100_I_Can_Stomach_That_Fearlessness_About_Death_Predicts_Attenuated_Facial_Electromyography_Activity_in_Response_to_Death-Related_Images","277959043_Learning_both_Weights_and_Connections_for_Efficient_Neural_Networks","273514012_A_Review_and_Meta-Analysis_of_Multimodal_Affect_Detection_Systems","262924374_A_survey_of_affective_brain_computer_interfaces_Principles_state-of-the-art_and_challenges","229060094_Scherer_KR_What_are_emotions_And_how_can_they_be_measured_Soc_Sci_Inf_44_695-729","221345737_Rectified_Linear_Units_Improve_Restricted_Boltzmann_Machines_Vinod_Nair","8516428_Emotion_recognition_system_using_short-term_monitoring_of_physiological_signals","5254144_Enhanced_facial_EMG_activity_in_response_to_dynamic_facial_expressions"]}
