{"id":"261490148_Using_serious_game_to_simplify_algorithm_learning","abstract":"It is argued that educational games have the potential to be an important teaching tool because they are interactive, engaging and immersive activities. They are seen as a way that allows the learner to participate actively in his learning, also a tool allowing the acquisition of knowledge. There are many advocates for the role that serious games could play in formal education. In this paper, we propose a serious game dedicated to learning algorithm which is an important topic in computer science education and its learning generally considered as a difficult and frustrating process. By a Serious Game we mean a computer application, whose combine the serious aspects (Serious), with the playing aspect of Video Games (Game). After a study of serious games genres and the skills developed by each genre, we present the conception and the realization of our serious game. This serious game aims to provide an innovative method to learn AVL trees.","authors":["Debabi Wassila","Belalia Tahar"],"meta":["July 2012","DOI:10.1109/ICEELI.2012.6360569","Conference: Education and e-Learning Innovations (ICEELI), 2012 International Conference on"],"references":["234788244_Simplifying_algorithm_learning_using_serious_games","26620625_Towards_a_Serious_Game_to_Help_Students_Learn_Computer_Programming","247442902_Introduction_To_Algorithms","2956388_From_Visual_Simulation_to_Virtual_Reality_to_Games"]}
