{"id":"270222387_Coloring_sparseness_and_girth","abstract":"An $r$-augmented tree is a rooted tree plus $r$ edges added from each leaf to\nancestors. For $d,g,r\\in\\mathbb{N}$, we construct a bipartite $r$-augmented\ncomplete $d$-ary tree having girth at least $g$. The height of such trees must\ngrow extremely rapidly in terms of the girth.\nUsing the resulting graphs, we construct sparse non-$k$-choosable bipartite\ngraphs, showing that maximum average degree at most $2(k-1)$ is a sharp\nsufficient condition for $k$-choosability in bipartite graphs, even when\nrequiring large girth. We also give a new simple construction of\nnon-$k$-colorable graphs and hypergraphs with any girth $g$.","authors":["Noga Alon","Alexandr Kostochka","Benjamin M. Reiniger","Douglas B.
