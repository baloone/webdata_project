{"id":"286812445_IHealth_A_fuzzy_approach_for_provisioning_intelligent_health-care_system_in_smart_city","abstract":"With the advent of Smart City, quality of life is bound to be better. But huge need arises to provide proper health-care services as the population is increasingly becoming urban-centric worldwide. The need-gap may be augmented with the help of modern technologies. Providing remote health-care services is a step forward. Successful diagnosis of health problems requires continuous monitoring of several health parameters. Health monitoring devices are power constrained and with limited communication capability. The devices are equipped with powerful microprocessors which are capable enough to take intelligent decisive actions by processing the received data. In order to prevent faster energy dissipation and constrained communication, selective data collection is an option. In this paper, a fuzzy assisted data gathering and alert scheme is proposed for healthcare services. Thus unnecessary waste of energy by transmission of unnecessary information is avoided. We have implemented it using Arduino and eHealth sensor kit.","authors":["Suman Sankar Bhunia","Sourav Kumar Dhar","Nandini Mukherjee"],"meta":["October 2014","DOI:10.1109/WiMOB.2014.6962169","Conference: 2014 IEEE 10th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)"],"references":["284569057_Battery_optimization_in_smartphones_for_remote_health_monitoring_systems_to_enhance_user_adherence","261419101_A_comparative_study_on_routing_schemes_of_IP_based_wireless_sensor_network","248930334_Will_the_Real_Smart_City_Please_Stand_Up","230713955_Secure_Remote_Health_Monitoring_with_Unreliable_Mobile_Devices","220354019_Remote_health-care_monitoring_using_Personal_Care_Connect","46433693_Smart_Cities_in_Europe","284462342_Fuzzy_Sets_Outline_of_a_New_Approach_to_the_Analysis_of_Complex_Systems_and_Decision_Processes","281273444_Sensor-Cloud_Enabling_Remote_Health-Care_services","228095891_Internet_of_Things_IoT_A_Vision_Architectural_Elements_and_FutureDirections","226087927_Fuzzy_logic_and_approximate_reasoning_-_In_memory_of_Grigore_Moisil","222648499_Wireless_Sensor_Network_Survey","220216070_Remote_health_monitoring_adoption_model_based_on_artificial_neural_networks","44797844_Remote_Health_Monitoring_Using_Mobile_Phones_and_Web_Services","3000775_Managing_care_through_the_air_remote_health_monitoring"]}
