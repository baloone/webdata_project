{"id":"326376162_The_Stealth_Media_Groups_and_Targets_behind_Divisive_Issue_Campaigns_on_Facebook","abstract":"In light of the foreign interference in the 2016 U.S. elections, the present research asks the question of whether the digital media has become the stealth media for anonymous political campaigns. By utilizing a user-based, real-time, digital ad tracking tool, the present research reverse engineers and tracks the groups (Study 1) and the targets (Study 2) of divisive issue campaigns based on 5 million paid ads on Facebook exposed to 9,519 individuals between September 28, 2016, and November 8, 2016. The findings reveal groups that did not file reports to the Federal Election Commission (FEC)—nonprofits, astroturf/movement groups, and unidentifiable “suspicious” groups, including foreign entities—ran most of the divisive issue campaigns. One out of six suspicious groups later turned out to be Russian groups. The volume of ads sponsored by non-FEC groups was 4 times larger than that of FEC groups. Divisive issue campaigns clearly targeted battleground states, including Pennsylvania and Wisconsin where traditional Democratic strongholds supported Donald Trump by a razor-thin margin. The present research asserts that media ecology, the technological features and capacity of digital media, as well as regulatory loopholes created by Citizens United v. FEC and the FEC’s disclaimer exemption for digital platforms contribute to the prevalence of anonymous groups’ divisive issue campaigns on digital media. The present research offers insight relevant for regulatory policy discussion and discusses the normative implications of the findings for the functioning of democracy.","authors":["Young Mie Kim","Jordan Hsu","David Neiman","Colin Kou"],"meta":["July 2018Political Communication 35(2):1-29","DOI:10.1080/10584609.2018.1476425","Project: Project DATA (Digital Advertising Tracking & Analysis)"],"references":["289539782_The_Valuable_Alliance_between_Social_Media_and_E-Commerce_Social_Networks_as_a_Tool_for_Transparency_Dialogue_and_Sales","287393379_The_logic_of_connective_action_Digital_media_and_the_personalization_of_contentious_politics","266655787_A_path_to_understanding_the_effects_of_algorithm_awareness","249683212_Issue_Publics_in_the_New_Information_Environment","249666712_Political_Communication_-Old_and_New_Media_Relationships","345900171_Prototype_Politics_Technology-Intensive_Campaigning_and_the_Data_of_Democracy","345839344_Mobilizing_Interest_Groups_in_America_Patrons_Professions_and_Social_Movements","344109917_Campaign_Finance_and_Political_Polarization_When_Purists_Prevail_When_Purists_Prevail","336972233_Why_Americans_Hate_the_Media_and_How_It_Matters","324974776_The_Persuadable_Voter_Wedge_Issues_in_Presidential_Campaigns","320436154_The_Myths_of_Data-Driven_Campaigning","316219748_Dark_Money_and_Dirty_Politics_Are_anonymous_ads_more_negative","314251542_Algorithmic_Opportunity_Digital_Advertising_and_Inequality_in_Political_Involvement","312900897_Analytic_Audiences_Digital_Listening_and_the_New_Political_Strategy","307554299_The_Koch_Network_and_Republican_Party_Extremism","306303749_The_Dynamics_of_Technology-Intensive_Campaigning_Technology-Intensive_Campaigning_and_the_Data_of_Democracy","305368949_Campaigning_Online_Web_Display_Ads_in_the_2012_Presidential_Campaign","290454278_Hacking_the_electorate_How_campaigns_perceive_voters","289417229_Organized_Interests_Evolution_and_Influence","288381544_The_MoveOn_Effect_The_Unexpected_Transformation_of_American_Political_Advocacy","287252990_Why_Americans_hate_the_media_and_how_it_matters","286114700_New_Media_Campaigns_and_the_Managed_Citizen","285985077_The_Persuadable_Voter_Wedge_Issues_in_Presidential_Campaigns","284558876_The_Decline_of_Party_Identifications","281453441_A_Voice_for_Nonprofits","280796635_Strategic_extremism_Why_Republicans_and_Democrats_divide_on_religious_values","273056177_Mobilizing_Interest_Groups_in_America_Patrons_Professions_and_Social_Movements","233246628_The_Nature_of_Belief_Systems_in_Mass_Publics","226293087_Government_Policy_and_Citizen_Passion_A_Study_of_Issue_Publics_in_Contemporary_America"]}
