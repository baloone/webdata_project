{"id":"332592331_Lesson_Planning_by_Computational_Thinking_Skills_in_Italian_Pre-service_Teachers","abstract":"In the last years, a growing trend in different educational contexts focused on Computational Thinking (CT) skills acquisition for both in-service teachers and students. But very low attention has been paid to pre-service teachers' education in regards to CT skills. To solve this issue, an empirical experimentation has been carried out with141 Italian pre-service teachers, that attended at a programming course, with the following aims: 1) provide them the main coding concepts by using Scratch 2.0; 2) offer practical advice on how to design educational applications (apps) to be applied into school context; 3) assess their apps by applying an already existing methodology, useful to give them feedback on their programming expertise and CT skills. Empirical findings showed that most of the participants achieved a medium-high level of CT skills, combining both design and programming skills in their school internship. Moreover, they reported a sense of greater self-esteem in teaching practice and a great emotional response from kids.","authors":["Lorella Gabriele","Francesca Bertacchini","Assunta Tavernise","Leticia Azucena Vaca-Cardenas"],"meta":["April 2019Informatics in Education 18(1):69-104","DOI:10.15388/infedu.2019.04"],"references":["316818512_An_Educational_Robotics_Lab_to_Investigate_Cognitive_Strategies_and_to_Foster_Learning_in_an_Arts_and_Humanities_Course_Degree","312827520_Learning_by_Doing_in_the_Digital_Media_Age","305427044_Youth_Technology_and_DIY_Developing_Participatory_Competencies_in_Creative_Media_Production","321610887_The_Language_of_Science_Education_An_Expanded_Glossary_of_Key_Terms_and_Concepts_in_Science_Teaching_and_Learning","316500909_Preparing_tomorrow's_faculty_to_address_challenges_in_teaching_computer_science","316475288_Designing_an_educational_music_software_using_a_student-centred_strategy","314718811_Shopping_with_a_robotic_companion","311489141_ITCH_Individual_Testing_of_Computer_Homework_for_Scratch_Assignments","308846015_Starting_from_scratch_Developing_a_pre-service_teacher_training_program_in_computational_thinking","308007008_Integrating_Programming_into_the_Mathematics_Curriculum_Combining_Scratch_and_Geometry_in_Grades_6_and_7"]}
