{"id":"320237304_Assessing_Gaussian_Assumption_of_PMU_Measurement_Error_Using_Field_Data","abstract":"Gaussian PMU measurement error has been assumed for many power system applications, such as state estimation, oscillatory modes monitoring, voltage stability analysis, to cite a few. This paper proposes a simple yet effective approach to assess this assumption by using the stability property of a probability distribution and the concept of redundant measurement. Extensive results using field PMU data from WECC system reveal that the Gaussian assumption is questionable.","authors":["Junbo Zhao","Shaobu Wang","Zhenyu Huang","Ruisheng Diao"],"meta":["October 2017IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery PP(99)","DOI:10.1109/TPWRD.2017.2762927","Project: Development of Robust Dynamic State Estimator for Power System Monitoring and Control"],"references":["309848750_A_Robust_Iterated_Extended_Kalman_Filter_for_Power_System_Dynamic_State_Estimation","313001335_De-noising_by_soft_thresholding","310454547_Characterizing_and_quantifying_noise_in_PMU_data","309456367_An_Analysis_of_Variance_Test_for_Normality_Complete_Samples","268064497_Testing_For_Normality","261087893_Extracting_steady_state_values_from_phasor_measurement_unit_data_using_FIR_and_median_filters","260509407_Generator_Dynamic_Model_Validation_and_Parameter_Calibration_Using_Phasor_Measurements_at_the_Point_of_Connection","3266743_Voltage-stability_protection_and_control_using_a_wide-area_network_of_phasor_measurements"]}
