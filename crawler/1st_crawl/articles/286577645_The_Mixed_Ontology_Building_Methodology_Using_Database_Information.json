{"id":"286577645_The_Mixed_Ontology_Building_Methodology_Using_Database_Information","abstract":"Recently, there has been a growing need for research to manage the knowledge of an organization effectively using ontology. To increase the effect of knowledge management, the development of a well-defined ontology using various concepts about the knowledge of an organization is needed. There are two approaches in the current methodology for ontology development. One approach is to develop ontology from database information, the other approach is to construct ontology using domain terms according to a top-down method or bottom-up method, and so on. In this paper, we propose a Mixed Ontology Building Methodology (MOBM) which combines the characteristics of both approaches to more effectively represent organizational knowledge on ontology. The proposed method first creates kernel ontology as the core, using various types of database information, including database schema, and then completes the additional ontology by applying the top-down method and the bottom-up method, respectively.","authors":["Minyoung Ra","Donghee Yoo","Sungchun No","Jinhee Shin"],"meta":["March 2012"],"references":["234791507_Generating_OWL_ontologies_from_a_relational_databases_for_the_semantic_web","221467177_Building_legal_ontologies_with_METHONTOLOGY_and_WebODE","220973908_DB2OWL_A_tool_for_automatic_database-to-ontology_mapping","220538166_Ontology_and_Database_Mapping_A_Survey_of_Current_Implementations_and_Future_Directions","47900984_Using_a_hybrid_approach_for_the_development_of_an_ontology_in_the_hydrographical_domain","3296767_Bottom-up_construction_of_ontologies","2942056_The_KACTUS_View_on_the_'O'_Word","2288533_Methodology_for_the_Design_and_Evaluation_of_Ontologies","264922728_Fundamentals_of_Database_Systems","244437488_A_Translation_Approach_to_Portable_Ontology_Specifications","225035627_Fundamentals_of_Database_Systems_4th_Edition","221158490_Mapping_between_Relational_Database_Schema_and_OWL_Ontology_for_Deep_Annotation","220795740_Building_ontologies_from_relational_databases_using_reverse_engineering_methods","220693068_Model_Driven_Engineering_and_Ontology_Development"]}
