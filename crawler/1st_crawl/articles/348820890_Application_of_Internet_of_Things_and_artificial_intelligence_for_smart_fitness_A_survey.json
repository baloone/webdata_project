{"id":"348820890_Application_of_Internet_of_Things_and_artificial_intelligence_for_smart_fitness_A_survey","abstract":"The revolution of Internet of Things (IoT) is pervading many facets of our everyday life. Among the multiple IoT application domains, well-being is becoming one of the popular scenarios in IoT which aims to offer new services including smart fitness. This paper focuses on smart fitness covering IoT-based solutions for this domain as well as the impacts of artificial intelligence and social-IoT. IoT-based smart fitness is divided into three categories: Fitness trackers (including wearable and non-wearable sensors), movement analysis and fitness applications. Data collected from IoT-based smart fitness and users could be used for enhancing training performance by Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based algorithms. Sensor to sensor relationship is another notable topic which can be implemented by social-IoT that can share data, information and experiences of usersâ€™ training from different places and times. In this his study a comprehensive review on different types of fitness trackers and fitness applications in provided and followed by a review of AI algorithms used in smart fitness scenarios. Lastly detail discussions on the benefits and the potential problems of smart fitness are presented and a shortlist of existing gaps and potential future work have been identified and proposed.","authors":["Alireza Farrokhi","Reza Farahbakhsh","Javad Rezazadeh","Roberto Minerva"],"meta":["January 2021Computer Networks
