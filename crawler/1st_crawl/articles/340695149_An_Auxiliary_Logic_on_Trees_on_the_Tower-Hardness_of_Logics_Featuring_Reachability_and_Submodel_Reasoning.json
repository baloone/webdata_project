{"id":"340695149_An_Auxiliary_Logic_on_Trees_on_the_Tower-Hardness_of_Logics_Featuring_Reachability_and_Submodel_Reasoning","abstract":"We describe a set of simple features that are sufficient in order to make the satisfiability problem of logics interpreted on trees Tower-hard. We exhibit these features through an Auxiliary Logic on Trees (ALT), a modal logic that essentially deals with reachability of a fixed node inside a forest and features modalities from sabotage modal logic to reason on submodels. After showing that ALT admits a Tower-complete satisfiability problem, we prove that this logic is captured by four other logics that were independently found to be Tower-complete: two-variables separation logic, quantified computation tree logic, modal logic of heaps and modal separation logic. As a by-product of establishing these connections, we discover strict fragments of these logics that are still non-elementary.","authors":["Alessio Mansutti"],"meta":["April 2020","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-45231-5_24","Conference: International Conference on Foundations of Software Science and Computation Structures","Project: Decision Procedures for Separation Logics"],"references":["345379748_The_Power_of_Modal_Separation_Logics","329520140_Extending_propositional_separation_logic_for_robustness_properties","324518990_The_Effects_of_Adding_Reachability_Predicates_in_Propositional_Separation_Logic","319534178_On_the_Complexity_of_Model_Checking_for_Syntactically_Maximal_Fragments_of_the_Interval_Temporal_Logic_HS_with_Regular_Expressions","318130157_Separation_Logic_with_One_Quantified_Variable","334998155_Why_Propositional_Quantification_Makes_Modal_Logics_on_Trees_Robustly_Hard","328780101_On_the_Almighty_Wand","321518398_Elements_of_Finite_Model_Theory","313107261_Interval_vs_Point_Temporal_Logic_Model_Checking_an_Expressiveness_Comparison","312829129_Moving_Fast_with_Software_Verification"]}
