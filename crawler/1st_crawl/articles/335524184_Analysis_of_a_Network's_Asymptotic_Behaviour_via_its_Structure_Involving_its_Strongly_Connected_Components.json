{"id":"335524184_Analysis_of_a_Network's_Asymptotic_Behaviour_via_its_Structure_Involving_its_Strongly_Connected_Components","abstract":"In this paper it is addressed how network structure can be related to asymptotic network behaviour. If such a relation is studied, that usually concerns only strongly connected networks and only linear functions describing the dynamics. In this paper both conditions are generalised. A couple of general theo-rems is presented that relates asymptotic behaviour of a network to the network’s structure characteristics. The network structure characteristics on the one hand concern the network’s strongly connected components and their mutual connections; this generalises the condition of being strongly connected to a very general condition. On the other hand, the network structure characteristics considered generalise from linear functions to functions that are normalised, monotonic and scalar-free, so that many nonlinear functions are also covered. Thus the contributed theorems generalise existing theorems on the relation between network structure and asymptotic network behaviour only addressing specific cases such as acyclic networks, fully and strongly connected networks, and theorems addressing only linear functions.","authors":["Jan Treur"],"meta":["October 2019Network Science 8(S1):S82-S109","DOI:10.1017/nws.2019.24","Project: Mathematical Analysis of Emergent Network Behaviour in Relation to the Network's Structure"],"references":["328190913_Mathematical_Analysis_of_a_Network's_Asymptotic_Behaviour_Based_on_Its_Strongly_Connected_Components","328190206_Relating_Emerging_Network_Behaviour_to_Network_Structure","327002298_Evolution_of_control_with_learning_classifier_systems","325391914_The_Ins_and_Outs_of_Network-Oriented_Modeling_From_Biological_Networks_and_Mental_Networks_to_Social_Networks_and_Beyond","325218032_A_Temporal-Causal_Network_Model_for_the_Effect_of_Emotional_Charge_on_Information_Sharing","313791285_On_the_Applicability_of_Network-Oriented_Modeling_Based_on_Temporal-Causal_Networks_Why_Network_Models_Do_Not_Just_Model_Networks","305930006_Network-Oriented_Modeling_Addressing_Complexity_of_Cognitive_Affective_and_Social_Interactions","324349511_Structural_Models_An_Introduction_to_the_Theory_of_Directed_Graphs","313581179_Mathematical_description_of_linear_dynamical_systems","305817691_Boundedness_Games_Invited_Presentation_at_the_Cassting_Workshop_on_Games_for_the_Synthesis_of_Complex_Systems_and_3rd_International_Workshop_on_Synthesis_of_Complex_Parameters"]}
