{"id":"334828845_Local_Search_Approximation_Algorithms_for_the_Spherical_k-Means_Problem","abstract":"In this paper, we study the spherical k-means problem (SKMP) which is one of the most well-studied clustering problems. In the SKMP, we are given an n-client set \\( \\mathcal {D}\\) in d-dimensional unit sphere \\(\\mathbb {S}^d\\), and an integer \\(k \\le n\\). The goal is to open a center subset \\(F \\subset \\mathbb {S}^d\\) with \\( |F| \\le k\\) that minimizes the sum of cosine dissimilarity measure for each client in \\( \\mathcal {D} \\) to the nearest open center. We give a \\((2 (4+\\sqrt{7}) + \\varepsilon )\\)-approximation algorithm for this problem using local search scheme.","authors":["Dongmei Zhang","Yukun Cheng","Min Li","Yishui Wang"],"meta":["August 2019","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-27195-4_31","In book: Algorithmic Aspects in Information and Management (pp.341-351)"],"references":["332848250_The_seeding_algorithms_for_spherical_k-means_clustering","311900754_Better_Guarantees_for_k-Means_and_Euclidean_k-Median_by_Primal-Dual_Algorithms","283428234_Spherical_k-Means_Clustering","263048867_An_Improved_Approximation_for_k-median_and_Positive_Correlation_in_Budgeted_Optimization","228822554_Approximation_algorithms_for_metric_facility_location_and_k-Median_problems_using_the_primal-dual_schema_and_Lagrangian_relaxation","221013402_The_Planar_k-Means_Problem_is_NP-Hard","220343586_NP-hardness_of_Euclidean_sum-of-squares_clustering","2830595_Local_Search_Heuristics_for_k_-Median_and_Facility_Location_Problems","332770699_Local_Search_Yields_Approximation_Schemes_for_k-Means_and_k-Median_in_Euclidean_and_Minor-Free_Metrics","332768551_Local_Search_Yields_a_PTAS_for_k-Means_in_Doubling_Metrics","321063349_On_the_Local_Structure_of_Stable_Clustering_Instances","314295725_An_Improved_Approximation_for_k_-Median_and_Positive_Correlation_in_Budgeted_Optimization","312970804_Improved_combinatorial_algorithms_for_the_facility_location_and_k-median_problems","309715704_Least_squares_quantization_in_PCM","301879242_Local_search_yields_approximation_schemes_for_k-means_and_k-median_in_Euclidean_and_minor-free_metrics","301841408_Tight_Analysis_of_a_Multiple-Swap_Heuristic_for_Budgeted_Red-Blue_Median","301837348_Local_Search_Yields_a_PTAS_for_k-Means_in_Doubling_Metrics","301706373_Approximating_k-Median_via_Pseudo-Approximation","290130612_Spherical_k-Means_Clustering","280104557_A_bi-criteria_approximation_algorithm_for_k_Means","266396655_The_Unreasonable_Success_of_Local_Search_Geometric_Optimization","222543557_A_Local_Search_Approximation_Algorithm_for_k-Means_Clustering","220908215_A_New_Approximation_Algorithm_for_the_k-Facility_Location_Problem","220778887_K-Means_The_Advantages_of_Careful_Seeding","220682848_Least_Squares_Quantization_in_PCM's","3832197_Improved_Combinatorial_Algorithms_for_Facility_Location_Problems","2801245_Concept_Decompositions_for_Large_Sparse_Text_Data_Using_Clustering"]}
