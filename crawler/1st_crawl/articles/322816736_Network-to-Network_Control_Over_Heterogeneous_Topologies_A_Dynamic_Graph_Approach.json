{"id":"322816736_Network-to-Network_Control_Over_Heterogeneous_Topologies_A_Dynamic_Graph_Approach","abstract":"This paper addresses a class of network-to-network control problems in the presence of heterogeneous topologies. To achieve the coordination of nodes in a controlled network, a networked controller with a heterogeneous topology is presented in an observer form based on the nearest neighbor rule. It is shown that the network-to-network control problem can be transformed into a coordination problem on a network subject to hybrid static and dynamic interactions. Furthermore, these hybrid interactions among nodes can be represented by appropriately constructing a dynamic graph, of which the connectivity provides a necessary and sufficient guarantee for all nodes to reach agreement on the average quantity of their initial conditions. Simulations are given to illustrate the effectiveness of our results obtained through the dynamic graph approach.","authors":["Deyuan Meng","Weili Niu","Xiaolu Ding","Lin Zhao"],"meta":["January 2018IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems PP(99):1-12","DOI:10.1109/TSMC.2018.2791576"],"references":[]}
