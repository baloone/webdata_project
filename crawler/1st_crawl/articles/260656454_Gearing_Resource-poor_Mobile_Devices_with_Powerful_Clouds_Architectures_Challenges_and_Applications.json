{"id":"260656454_Gearing_Resource-poor_Mobile_Devices_with_Powerful_Clouds_Architectures_Challenges_and_Applications","abstract":"Mobile cloud computing, with its promise to meet the urgent need for richer applications and services of resource-constrained mobile devices, is emerging as a new computing paradigm and has recently attracted significant attention. However, there is no clear definition and no well defined scope for mobile cloud computing due to commercial hype, and diverse ways of combining cloud computing and mobile applications. This article makes the first attempt to present a survey of mobile cloud computing from the perspective of its intended usages. Specifically, we introduce three common mobile cloud architectures and classify comprehensive existing work into two fundamental categories: computation offloading and capability extending. Considering the energy bottleneck and user context of mobile devices, we discuss the research challenges and opportunities of introducing cloud computing to assist mobile devices, including energy-efficient interactions, virtual machine migration overhead, privacy, and security. Moreover, we demonstrate three real-world applications enabled by mobile cloud computing, in order to stimulate further discussion and development of this emerging field.","authors":["Fangming Liu","Peng Shu","Hai Jin","Linjie Ding"],"meta":["June 2013IEEE Wireless Communications 20(3):14-22","DOI:10.1109/MWC.2013.6549279"],"references":["241630442_ThinkAir_Dynamic_resource_allocation_and_parallel_execution_in_the_cloud_for_mobile_code_offloading","228574829_Cloud_Towards_a_New_Paradigm_of_Rich_Mobile_Applications","224243207_Secure_data_processing_framework_for_mobile_cloud_computing","224119280_CloudTorrent_-_Energy-Efficient_BitTorrent_Content_Sharing_for_Mobile_Devices_via_Cloud_Services","221655674_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","221234509_MAUI_Making_smartphones_last_longer_with_code_offload","220300035_The_Case_for_VM-Based_Cloudlets_in_Mobile_Computing","220269503_Authentication_in_the_clouds_A_framework_and_its_application_to_mobile_users","220134486_Towards_an_Elastic_Application_Model_for_Augmenting_the_Computing_Capabilities_of_Mobile_Devices_with_Cloud_Computing","309201112_The_case_for_VM-based_cloudlets_in_mobile_computing","262311339_COMET_code_offload_by_migrating_execution_transparently","261060186_eTime_Energy-Efficient_Transmission_between_Cloud_and_Mobile_Devices","254031698_Socialize_spontaneously_with_mobile_applications","247928033_A_virtual_cloud_computing_provider_for_mobile_devices","224116330_A_2G-RFID-based_e-healthcare_system","221611887_Energy_Consumption_in_Mobile_Phones_A_Measurement_Study_and_Implications_for_Network_Applications","221351797_CloneCloud_Elastic_execution_between_mobile_device_and_cloud","220838722_MobiCloud_Building_Secure_Cloud_Framework_for_Mobile_Computing_and_Communication"]}
