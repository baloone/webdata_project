{"id":"319383049_Defining_Fake_News_A_typology_of_scholarly_definitions","abstract":"This paper is based on a review of how previous studies have defined and operationalized the term “fake news.” An examination of 34 academic articles that used the term “fake news” between 2003 and 2017 resulted in a typology of types of fake news: news satire, news parody, fabrication, manipulation, advertising, and propaganda. These definitions are based on two dimensions: levels of facticity and deception. Such a typology is offered to clarify what we mean by fake news and to guide future studies.","authors":["Edson Tandoc","Zheng Wei Lim","Richard Ling"],"meta":["August 2017Digital Journalism 6(3):1-17","DOI:10.1080/21670811.2017.1360143"],"references":["310673769_Aesthetics_of_Fake_An_Overview","287232457_Detecting_Fake_Websites_The_Contribution_of_Statistical_Learning_Theory","283866414_The_Journalist_is_Marketing_the_News","283721117_Misleading_Online_Content_Recognizing_Clickbait_as_False_News","323990996_The_MAIN_Model_A_Heuristic_Approach_to_Understanding_Technology_Effects_on_Credibility","316712634_Social_Media_and_Fake_News_in_the_2016_Election","308909364_What_Online_Reviewer_Behaviors_Really_Matter_Effects_of_Verbal_and_Nonverbal_Behaviors_on_Detection_of_Fake_Online_Reviews","301245962_Fake_News_The_narrative_battle_over_the_Ukrainian_conflict","283183426_News_Bots","280297156_Commentaries"]}
