{"id":"222219393_STRIPS_A_new_approach_to_the_application_of_theorem_proving_to_problem_solving","abstract":"We describe a new problem solver called STRIPS that attempts to find a sequence of operators in a space of world models to transform a given initial world model in which a given goal formula can be proven to be true. STRIPS represents a world model as an arbitrary collection in first-order predicate calculus formulas and is designed to work with models consisting of large numbers of formula. It employs a resolution theorem prover to answer questions of particular models and uses means-ends analysis to guide it to the desired goal-satisfying model.","authors":["Richard Fikes","Nils J.
