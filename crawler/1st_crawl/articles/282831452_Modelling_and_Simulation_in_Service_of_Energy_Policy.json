{"id":"282831452_Modelling_and_Simulation_in_Service_of_Energy_Policy","abstract":"Modelling and simulation has long and well served the actors and various decision makers in the domain of energy policy. Various modelling approaches and models have been applied to address a variety of energy policy related issues. However, the journey continues. This paper provides an overview of these modelling approaches and models and identifies their key challenges in the face of emerging issues. The identified energy policy modelling related issues include the characterization of energy systems as complex, dynamic system with numerous uncertainties, non-linearities, time lags, and intertwined feedback loops. System dynamics modelling as a viable solution to address these issues is also suggested.","authors":["Hassan Qudrat-Ullah"],"meta":["August 2015Energy Procedia 75:2819-2825","DOI:10.1016/j.egypro.2015.07.558"],"references":["260084395_Understanding_the_dynamics_of_electricity_generation_capacity_in_Canada_A_system_dynamics_approach","260083372_Understanding_the_dynamics_of_the_electricity_generation_capacity_in_Canada_A_system_dynamics_approach","324286148_Complementary_Modelling_Approaches_for_Analysing_Several_Effects_of_Privatization_on_Electricity_Investment","297831236_Simulation_of_Greenhouse_Gas_Cap-and-Trade_Systems_with_ENERGY_2020","275755100_Industrial_Dynamics","273330153_Better_Decision_Making_in_Complex_Dynamic_Tasks","263328706_Complementary_Modelling_Approaches_for_Analysing_Several_Effects_of_Privatization_on_Electricity_Investment","263173857_Business_Dynamics-Systems_Thinking_and_Modeling_for_a_Complex_World","260517439_Distributed_energy_resource_system_optimisation_using_mixed_integer_linear_programming","246897536_System_Dynamics_and_the_Electric_Power_Industry"]}
