{"id":"221550829_Bases_as_Coalgebras","abstract":"The free algebra adjunction, between the category of algebras of a monad and the underlying category, induces a comonad on\nthe category of algebras. The coalgebras of this comonad are the topic of study in this paper (following earlier work). It\nis illustrated how such coalgebras-on-algebras can be understood as bases, decomposing each element x into primitives elements from which x can be reconstructed via the operations of the algebra. This holds in particular for the free vector space monad, but also\nfor other monads. For instance, continuous dcpos or stably continuous frames, where each element is the join of the elements\nway below it, can be described as such coalgebras. Further, it is shown how these coalgebras-on-algebras give rise to a comonoid\nstructure for copy and delete, and thus to diagonalisation of endomaps like in linear algebra.","authors":["Bart Jacobs"],"meta":["August 2011Logical Methods in Computer Science 9(3):237-252","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-22944-2_17","SourceDBLP","Conference: Algebra and Coalgebra in Computer Science - 4th International Conference, CALCO 2011, Winchester, UK, August 30 - September 2, 2011.
