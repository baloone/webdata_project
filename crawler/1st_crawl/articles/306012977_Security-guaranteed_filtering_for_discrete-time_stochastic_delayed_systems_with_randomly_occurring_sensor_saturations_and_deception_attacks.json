{"id":"306012977_Security-guaranteed_filtering_for_discrete-time_stochastic_delayed_systems_with_randomly_occurring_sensor_saturations_and_deception_attacks","abstract":"In this paper, the security-guaranteed filtering problem is studied for a class of nonlinear stochastic discrete time-delay systems with randomly occurring sensor saturations (ROSSs) and randomly occurring deception attacks (RODAs). The nonlinearities in systems satisfy the sector-bounded conditions, and the time-varying delays are unknown with given lower and upper bounds. A novel measurement output model is proposed to reflect both the ROSSs and the RODAs. A new definition is put forward on the security level with respect to the noise intensity, the energy bound of the false signals, the energy of the initial system state, and the desired security degree. We aim at designing a filter such that, in the presence of ROSSs and RODAs, the filtering error dynamics achieves the prescribed level of security. By using the stochastic analysis techniques, a sufficient condition is first derived under which the filtering error system is guaranteed to have the desired security level, and then, the filter gain is designed by solving a linear matrix inequality with nonlinear constraints. Finally, a numerical example is provided to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed filtering scheme. Copyright","authors":["Dong Wang","Zidong Wang","Bo Shen","F.E.
