{"id":"316907118_Shannon_sampling_and_an_inverse_problem_for_the_Schrodinger_equation_on_combinatorial_graphs","abstract":"We consider functions on a weighted combinatorial graph G (finite or countable) whose evolution in time −∞ < t < ∞ is governed by the Schrodinger type equation ∂g(t, v)/∂t = iΔg(t, v), v ∊ V (G), with the combinatorial Laplace operator on the right side. Two Shannon-type sampling theorems are proved which imply that if the initial data g(0, v) is a Paley-Wiener function of bandwidth ≤ ω then the solution g(t, v) for all t ∊ (−∞,∞), v ∊ V (G) can be perfectly reconstructed from the values of g on a set K × S where K is a sufficiently dense set of equally spaced real numbers and S is a sampling set for the space of Paley-Wiener function of bandwidth ≤ ω. We also consider an inverse problem of reconstructing the initial function g(0, ·) from a single sample g(T, ·).","authors":["Isaac Pesenson"],"meta":["December 2016","DOI:10.1109/GlobalSIP.2016.7905857","Conference: 2016 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing (GlobalSIP)"],"references":["308854221_Sampling_solutions_of_Schrodinger_equations_on_combinatorial_graphs","264950527_Poincare_and_Plancherel--Polya_Inequalities_in_Harmonic_Analysis_on_Weighted_Combinatorial_Graphs","263753346_The_sampling_theorem_Poisson's_summation_formula_general_Parseval_formula_reproducing_kernel_formula_and_the_Paley-Wiener_theorem_for_bandlimited_signals_-_their_interconnections","261344786_Signal_processing_techniques_for_interpolation_in_graph_structured_data","260482747_Sampling_Formulas_for_Groups_of_Operators_in_Banach_Spaces","243026855_Removable_sets_and_approximation_of_eigenvalues_and_eigenfunctions_on_combinatorial_graphs","232743728_The_Emerging_Field_of_Signal_Processing_on_Graphs_Extending_High-Dimensional_Data_Analysis_to_Networks_and_Other_Irregular_Domains","225357268_Sampling_Filtering_and_Sparse_Approximations_on_Combinatorial_Graphs","51959193_Variational_Splines_and_Paley--Wiener_Spaces_on_Combinatorial_Graphs","200524273_Foundations_of_Time--Frequency_Analysis"]}
