We systematically reviewed the literature to map and evaluate the quality of long-term offspring outcomes in follow-up cohorts of randomised controlled trials (RCTs).\n\nMethods\nWe searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects and Cochrane Central (until March 2019) for all RCTs evaluating any lifestyle (diet or exercise) intervention during pregnancy and their follow-up cohorts. Two reviews evaluated the extracted outcomes using two standardised assessment tools, one for quality of reporting (score range 0–6) and another for the variation in outcome selection. We extracted data in duplicate and reported using natural frequencies, medians, ranges, means and standard deviation (SD).\n\nResults\nWe captured 30 long-term offspring outcomes reported in six articles (four studies). Offspring anthropometric measurements were the most commonly reported outcomes. There was a large variation in the measurement tools used. The mean overall quality score for outcome reporting was 3.33 (SD 1.24), with poor reporting of secondary outcomes and limited justification for the choice of the reported outcomes. Most studies showed selective reporting for both their primary and secondary outcomes.\n\nConclusion\nThe quality of reporting for long-term offspring outcomes following lifestyle interventions in pregnancy is varied with evidence of selective outcome reporting. Developing a core outcome set will help to reduce the variations in outcome reporting to optimise future research.","authors":["Rocío Olmedo-Requena","Carmen Amezcua-Prieto","Bassel H.
