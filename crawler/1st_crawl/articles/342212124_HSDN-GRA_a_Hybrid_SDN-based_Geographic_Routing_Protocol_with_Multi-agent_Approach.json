{"id":"342212124_HSDN-GRA_a_Hybrid_SDN-based_Geographic_Routing_Protocol_with_Multi-agent_Approach","abstract":"We propose in this paper a Hybrid Software-Defined Networking based Geographical Routing Protocol (HSDN-GRA) with a clustering approach. It takes into account three different criteria to select the best relay to send data: 1) the contact duration between vehicles, 2) the available load of each vehicle, 3) and the log of encountered communication errors embedded in each cluster head. The multi-criteria strategy allows the selection of the most reliable vehicles by avoiding communication problems and ensuring connection availability. Once the hybrid control plane has found out the next eligible neighbor, the data plane will be in charge of dividing and sending data. \nTo validate our approach, HSDN-GRA has been modeled and implemented in JADE, a multi-agent platform, to be compared to other multi-agent based protocols. Simulation results show that HSDN-GRA achieves good performance with respect to the average routing overhead, the packet drop rate and the throughput.","authors":["Lylia Alouache","Nga Nguyen","Rachid Chelouah","Makhlouf Aliouat"],"meta":["October 2020International Journal of Communication Systems 33(7)","DOI:10.1002/dac.4521","Project: IoV & VANETs"],"references":["329146139_Survey_on_IoV_routing_protocols_Security_and_network_architecture","325171206_Toward_a_Hybrid_SDN_Architecture_for_V2V_Communication_in_IoV_Environment","321049810_Situation-Aware_Protocol_Switching_in_Software-Defined_Wireless_Sensor_Network_Systems","323966328_Routing_in_Heterogeneous_Vehicular_Networks_using_an_adapted_Software_Defined_Networking_approach","323563336_SDCoR_Software_Defined_Cognitive_Routing_for_Internet_of_Vehicles","321823669_An_SDN_hybrid_architecture_for_vehicular_networks_Application_to_Intelligent_Transport_System","318473682_A_Multi-Cooperative-Based_Approach_to_Manage_Communication_in_Wireless_Instrumentation_Systems","318433824_Software-Defined_Vehicular_Networks_Architecture_Algorithms_and_Applications_Part_1","318140664_dSDiVN_A_Distributed_Software-Defined_Networking_Architecture_for_Infrastructure-Less_Vehicular_Networks","316727502_SDGR_An_SDN-Based_Geographic_Routing_Protocol_for_VANET","313866209_Network_Intelligence_Based_on_Network_State_Information_for_Connected_Vehicles_Utilizing_Fog_Computing","308483874_Novel_Optimized_Routing_Scheme_for_VANETs","310666295_Vehicular_Network-Aware_Route_Selection_Considering_Communication_Requirements_of_Users_for_ITS","308862099_An_enhanced_GPSR_routing_protocol_based_on_the_buffer_length_of_nodes_for_the_congestion_problem_in_VANETs","308847455_A_Software_Defined_Network_architecture_for_GeoBroadcast_in_VANETs"]}
