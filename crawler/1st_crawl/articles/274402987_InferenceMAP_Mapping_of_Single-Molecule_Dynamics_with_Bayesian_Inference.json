{"id":"274402987_InferenceMAP_Mapping_of_Single-Molecule_Dynamics_with_Bayesian_Inference","abstract":"Single-particle tracking (SPT) grants unprecedented insight into cellular\nfunction at the molecular scale [1]. Throughout the cell, the movement of\nsingle-molecules is generally heterogeneous and complex. Hence, there is an\nimperative to understand the multi-scale nature of single-molecule dynamics in\nbiological systems. We have previously shown that with high-density SPT,\nspatial maps of the parameters that dictate molecule motion can be generated to\nintricately describe cellular environments [2,3,4]. To date, however, there\nexist no publically available tools that reconcile trajectory data to generate\nthe aforementioned maps. We address this void in the SPT community with\nInferenceMAP: an interactive software package that uses a powerful Bayesian\nmethod to map the dynamic cellular space experienced by individual\nbiomolecules.","authors":["Mohamed El Beheiry","Maxime Dahan","jean-baptiste Masson"],"meta":["April 2015Biophysical Journal 108(2)","DOI:10.1016/j.bpj.2014.11.2580","SourcearXiv"],"references":["259808467_Objective_Comparison_of_Particle_Tracking_Methods","24173822_Inferring_Maps_of_Forces_Inside_Cell_Membrane_Microdomains","263207942_Tracking_single_molecules_at_work_in_living_cells","259697186_Mapping_the_Energy_and_Diffusion_Landscapes_of_Membrane_Proteins_at_the_Cell_Surface_Using_High-Density_Single-Molecule_Imaging_and_Bayesian_Inference_Application_to_the_Multiscale_Dynamics_of_Glycine","45659330_Dynamic_Superresolution_Imaging_of_Endogenous_Proteins_on_Living_Cells_at_Ultra-High_Density"]}
