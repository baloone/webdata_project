{"id":"354551773_Indirect_Structural_Muscle_Injuries_of_Lower_Limb_Rehabilitation_and_Therapeutic_Exercise","abstract":"Muscle injuries are the most common trauma in team and individual sports. The muscles most frequently affected are those of the lower limb, and in particular hamstrings, adductors, rectus femoris and calf muscles. Although several scientific studies have tried to propose different rehabilitation protocols, still too often the real rehabilitation process is not based on scientific knowledge, especially in non-elite athletes. Moreover, the growing use of physical and instrumental therapies has made it increasingly difficult to understand what can be truly effective. Therefore, the aim of the present paper is to review proposed therapeutic algorithms for muscle injuries, proposing a concise and practical summary. Following a three-phase rehabilitation protocol, this review aims to describe the conservative treatment of indirect structural muscle injuries, which are the more routinely found and more challenging type. For each phase, until return to training and return to sport are completed, the functional goal, the most appropriate practitioner, and the best possible treatment according to current evidence are expressed. Finally, the last section is focused on the specific exercise rehabilitation for the four main muscle groups with a structured explanatory timetable.","authors":["Stefano Palermi","Bruno Massa","Marco Vecchiato","Fiore Mazza"],"meta":["September 2021Journal of Functional Morphology and Kinesiology 6(75):75","DOI:10.3390/jfmk6030075","Project: Sport injuries rehabilitation & prevention"],"references":["343760206_How_to_Use_Global_Positioning_Systems_GPS_Data_to_Monitor_Training_Load_in_the_Real_World_of_Elite_Soccer","343497578_Effects_of_Hoverboard_on_Balance_in_Young_Soccer_Athletes","336572128_Italian_consensus_statement_2020_on_return_to_play_after_lower_limb_muscle_injury_in_football_soccer","331270610_ISMuLT_skeletal_muscles_injuries_Guidelines","326962137_Characterization_of_Skeletal_Muscle_Strain_Lesion_Induced_by_Stretching_in_Rats_Effects_of_Laser_Photobiomodulation","325932510_Nonoperative_treatment_of_muscle_injuries_-_recommendations_from_the_GOTS_expert_meeting","350150112_Long_head_biceps_tendon_instability_diagnostic_performance_of_known_and_new_MRI_diagnostic_signs","343242516_CURRENT_TOPICS_FOR_TEACHING_SKELETAL_MUSCLE_PHYSIOLOGY","338521238_Exercise_induced_changes_in_echo_intensity_within_the_muscle_a_brief_review","331265642_Return_to_sports_after_ACL_reconstruction_a_new_functional_test_protocol"]}
