{"id":"256937190_Nonconforming_quadrilateral_finite_element_method_for_a_class_of_nonlinear_sine-Gordon_equations","abstract":"Nonconforming quadrilateral finite element method (FEM) of the two-dimensional nonlinear sine–Gordon equation is studied for semi-discrete and Crank–Nicolson fully-discrete schemes, respectively. Firstly, we prove a special feature of a new arbitrary quadrilateral element (named modified Quasi–Wilson element), i.e., the consistency error is of order O(h2)O(h2) (h denotes the mesh size) in H1H1-norm, which leads to optimal order error estimate and superclose result with order O(h2)O(h2) for the semi-discrete scheme through a different approach from the existing literature. Secondly, because the consistency error estimate of the new modified Quasi–Wilson element can reach a staggering O(h3)O(h3) order, two orders higher than that of interpolation error, the optimal order error estimates of Crank–Nicolson fully-discrete scheme are obtained on arbitrary quadrilateral meshes with Ritz projection. Moreover, a superclose result in H1H1-norm is presented on generalized rectangular meshes by a new technique. Thirdly, the global superconvergence results of H1H1-norm for both semi-discrete and fully-discrete schemes are derived on rectangular meshes with interpolated postprocessing technique. Finally, a numerical test is carried out to verify the theoretical analysis.","authors":["Dongyang Shi","Lifang Pei"],"meta":["May 2013Applied Mathematics and Computation 219(17):9447–9460","DOI:10.1016/j.amc.2013.03.008"],"references":["268243570_Anisotropic_nonconforming_finite_element_with_some_superconvergence_results","299070733_Dimension_of_the_global_attractor_for_the_damped_and_driven_sine-Gordon_equation","284305567_Constrained_nonconforming_rotated_Q1_element_for_Stokes_flow_and_planar_elasticity","269014476_Superconvergence_analysis_of_nonconforming_mixed_finite_element_method_for_Stokes_problem","269007945_Global_solutions_for_a_kind_of_generalized_Sine-Gordon_equation_with_strong_damping","268865540_The_global_solution_and_numerical_computation_of_the_generalized_nonlinear_Sine-Gordon_equation","268613134_Superconvergence_and_extrapolation_of_non-conforming_low_order_finite_elements_applied_to_the_Poisson_equation","266956678_Numerical_solutions_of_H_1_-Galerkin_mixed_finite_element_method_for_a_damped_Sine-Gordon_equation","266941641_An_estimate_of_the_dimension_of_the_global_attractor_for_a_sine-Gordon_equation","266836974_A_class_of_low_order_nonconforming_finite_element_analysis_for_the_sine-Gordon_equation","266751950_A_nonconforming_element_like_Wilson's_for_second_order_problems","266612879_A_kind_of_improved_Wilson_arbitrary_quadrilateral_elements","266527340_An_ADI_scheme_for_the_generalized_nonlinear_Sine-Gordon_equation_in_two_dimensions","266280956_Accuracy_analysis_for_Quasi-Wilson_element","266033152_High_accuracy_analysis_of_fully_discrete_Galerkin_approximations_for_parabolic_equations_on_anisotropic_meshes","265373941_Conforming_and_nonconforming_finite_element_methods_for_solving_the_stationary_Stokes_equations_I","258898956_On_Dynamical_Two-Dimensional_Solutions_to_the_Sine-Gordon_Equation","257194528_The_solution_of_the_sine-Gordon_equation_using_method_of_lines","256744639_A_Decomposition_Method_for_Solving_the_Nonlinear_Klein-Gordon_Equation","256392163_Two_energy_conserving_numerical_schemes_for_the_Sine-Gordon_equation","256391754_Numerical_solution_of_the_Sine-Gordon_equation","252412009_Return_effect_for_rotationally_symmetric_solitary_wave_solutions_to_the_sine-Gordon_equation","250690788_An_analysis_of_finite_element_equation_and_mesh_subdivision","239383097_A_generalized_conforming_isoparametric_element","229763212_Convergence_of_the_Interpolated_Coefficient_Finite_Element_Method_for_the_Two-Dimensional_Elliptic_Sine-Gordon_Equations","225312931_Direct_method_of_finding_exact_solutions_of_nonlinear_evolution_equations","222746048_Finite_element_approximation_to_two-dimensional_Sine-Gordon_solitons","222282650_A_third_order_numerical_scheme_for_the_two-dimensional_sine-Gordon_equation","220347690_Numerical_simulation_of_two-dimensional_Sine-Gordon_solitons_via_a_split_cosine_scheme","51992454_The_Finite_Element_Method_For_Elliptic_Problems","51992213_Simple_nonconforming_quadrilateral_Stokes_element","43407356_A_class_of_Crouzeix-Raviart_type_nonconforming_finite_element_methods_for_parabolic_variational_inequality_problem_with_moving_grid_on_anisotropic_meshes","27297455_P1-Nonconforming_Quadrilateral_Finite_Element_Methods_for_Second-Order_Elliptic_Problems"]}
