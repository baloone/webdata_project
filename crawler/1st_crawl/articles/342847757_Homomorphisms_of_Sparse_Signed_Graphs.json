{"id":"342847757_Homomorphisms_of_Sparse_Signed_Graphs","abstract":"The notion of homomorphism of signed graphs, introduced quite recently, provides better interplay with the notion of minor and is thus of high importance in graph coloring. A newer, but equivalent, definition of homomorphisms of signed graphs, proposed jointly by the second and third authors of this paper and Thomas Zaslavsky, leads to a basic no-homomorphism lemma. According to this definition, a signed graph $(G, \\sigma)$ admits a homomorphism to a signed graph $(H, \\pi)$ if there is a mapping $\\phi$ from the vertices and edges of $G$ to the vertices and edges of $H$ (respectively) which preserves adjacencies, incidences, and signs of closed walks (i.e., the product of the sign of their edges). For $ij=00, 01, 10, 11$, let $g_{ij}(G,\\sigma)$ be the length of a shortest nontrivial closed walk of $(G, \\sigma)$ which is, positive and of even length for $ij=00$, positive and of odd length for $ij=01$, negative and of even length for $ij=10$, negative and of odd length for $ij=11$. For each $ij$, if there is no nontrivial closed walk of the corresponding type, we let $g_{ij}(G, \\sigma)=\\infty$. If $G$ is bipartite, then $g_{01}(G,\\sigma)=g_{11}(G,\\sigma)=\\infty$. In this case, $g_{10}(G,\\sigma)$ is certainly realized by a cycle of $G$, and it will be referred to as the \\emph{unbalanced-girth} of $(G,\\sigma)$. It then follows that if $(G,\\sigma)$ admits a homomorphism to $(H, \\pi)$, then $g_{ij}(G, \\sigma)\\geq g_{ij}(H, \\pi)$ for $ij \\in \\{00, 01,10,11\\}$. Studying the restriction of homomorphisms of signed graphs on sparse families, in this paper we first prove that for any given signed graph $(H, \\pi)$, there exists a positive value of $\\epsilon$ such that, if $G$ is a connected graph of maximum average degree less than $2+\\epsilon$, and if $\\sigma$ is a signature of $G$ such that $g_{ij}(G, \\sigma)\\geq g_{ij}(H, \\pi)$ for all $ij \\in \\{00, 01,10,11\\}$, then $(G, \\sigma)$ admits a homomorphism to $(H, \\pi)$. For $(H, \\pi)$ being the signed graph on $K_4$ with exactly one negative edge, we show that $\\epsilon=\\frac{4}{7}$ works and that this is the best possible value of $\\epsilon$. For $(H, \\pi)$ being the negative cycle of length $2g$, denoted $UC_{2g}$, we show that $\\epsilon=\\frac{1}{2g-1}$ works. As a bipartite analogue of the Jaeger-Zhang conjecture, Naserasr, Sopena and Rollovà conjectured in [Homomorphisms of signed graphs, {\\em J. Graph Theory} 79 (2015)] that every signed bipartite planar graph $(G,\\sigma)$ satisfying $g_{ij}(G,\\sigma)\\geq 4g-2$ admits a homomorphism to $UC_{2g}$. We show that $4g-2$ cannot be strengthened, and, supporting the conjecture, we prove it for planar signed bipartite graphs $(G,\\sigma)$ satisfying the weaker condition $g_{ij}(G,\\sigma)\\geq 8g-2$. In the course of our work, we also provide a duality theorem to decide whether a 2-edge-colored graph admits a homomorphism to a certain class of 2-edge-colored signed graphs or not.","authors":["Clément Charpentier","Reza Naserasr","Eric Sopena"],"meta":["July 2020The Electronic Journal of Combinatorics 27(3)","DOI:10.37236/8478"],"references":["344851090_Bounding_signed_series-parallel_graphs_and_cores_of_signed_K_4_-subdivisions","343951678_Homomorphisms_of_signed_graphs_An_update","312236637_An_introduction_to_the_discharging_method_via_graph_coloring","267436576_Homomorphisms_of_planar_signed_graphs_to_signed_projective_cubes","264625947_Homomorphisms_of_Signed_Graphs","304027261_Homomorphisms_of_2-Edge-Colored_Triangle-Free_Planar_Graphs_HOMOMORPHISMS_OF_2-EDGE-COLORED_TRIANGLE-FREE_PLANAR_GRAPHS","283043651_The_complexity_of_signed_graph_and_edge-coloured_graph_homomorphisms","266999487_On_circular_flows_in_graphs","264470280_2_-Coloring_of_planar_graphs_with_large_odd-girth","263479544_Mapping_Planar_Graphs_into_Projective_Cubes"]}
