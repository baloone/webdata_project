{"id":"322688165_Chaos-Based_Underwater_Communication_With_Arbitrary_Transducers_and_Bandwidth","abstract":"In this work, an enhanced differential chaos shift keying (DCSK), based on a first order hybrid chaotic system, is being proposed for a high reliability underwater acoustic communication system. It can be integrated into systems that use standard existing transducers. We show that a coherent operation between the received signal and the time reversal of the basis function in a first order hybrid chaotic system maximizes the signal to noise ratio at the receiver. Concurrently, DCSK configuration is used to resist the distortion caused by the complex underwater acoustic channel. Our simulation results show that the proposed method has lower bit error rate (BER). In addition, it shows higher communication reliability over underwater acoustic channel as compared to the conventional DCSK using logistic map and its variant forms such as Correlation Delay Shift Keying (CDSK), Phase-Separate DCSK (PS-DCSK), High Efficiency DCSK (HE-DCSK), and Reference Modulated DCSK (RM-DCSK).","authors":["Chao Bai","Hai Peng Ren","Celso Grebogi","Murilo da Silva Baptista"],"meta":["January 2018Applied Sciences 8(2):162","DOI:10.3390/app8020162","Project: Impact of under water accoustic channel constraints on chaotic signal and its application"],"references":["321094817_On_the_Antijamming_Performance_of_the_NR-DCSK_System","320461452_Data_Access_Based_on_a_Guide_Map_of_the_Underwater_Wireless_Sensor_Network","318391423_Cross_Deployment_Networking_and_Systematic_Performance_Analysis_of_Underwater_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","320025137_Chaos-based_wireless_communication_resisting_multipath_effects","318067635_Joint_Channel_Estimation_and_Impulsive_Noise_Mitigation_in_Underwater_Acoustic_OFDM_Communication_Systems","317432448_Secure_Communication_Based_on_Hyperchaotic_Chen_System_with_Time-Delay","317129374_The_Watermark_Benchmark_for_Underwater_Acoustic_Modulation_Schemes","317107914_An_easy_encoding_and_low_bit-error-rate_chaos_communication_system_based_on_reverse-time_chaotic_oscillator","316284820_Dynamics_of_delay_induced_composite_multi-scroll_attractor_and_its_application_in_encryption","314115062_A_Chaotic_Spread_Spectrum_System_for_Underwater_Acoustic_Communication"]}
