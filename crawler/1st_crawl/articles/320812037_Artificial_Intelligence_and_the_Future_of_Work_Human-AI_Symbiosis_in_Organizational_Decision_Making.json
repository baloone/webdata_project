{"id":"320812037_Artificial_Intelligence_and_the_Future_of_Work_Human-AI_Symbiosis_in_Organizational_Decision_Making","abstract":"Artificial intelligence (AI) has penetrated many organizational processes, resulting in a growing fear that smart machines will soon replace many humans in decision-making. To provide a more proactive and pragmatic perspective, this article highlights the complementarity of humans and AI, and examines how each can bring their own strength in organizational decision making processes typically characterized by uncertainty, complexity, and equivocality. With a greater computational information processing capacity and an analytical approach, AI can extend humans' cognition when addressing complexity, whereas humans can still offer a more holistic, intuitive approach in dealing with uncertainty and equivocality in organizational decision-making. This premise mirrors the idea of 'intelligence augmentation': AI systems should be designed with the intention of augmenting, not replacing, human contributions.","authors":["Mohammad Hossein Jarrahi"],"meta":["July 2018Business Horizons 61(4)","DOI:10.1016/j.bushor.2018.03.007","Project: Artificial intelligence and the future of work"],"references":["321016460_Cognitive_collaboration_Why_humans_and_computers_think_better_together","304163398_Deep_Learning_for_Identifying_Metastatic_Breast_Cancer","317655571_Locally_noisy_autonomous_agents_improve_global_human_coordination_in_network_experiments","316557639_Causality_correlation_and_artificial_intelligence_for_rational_decision_making","314480720_The_Design_of_Business_Why_Design_Thinking_Is_the_Next_Competitive_Edge","308667590_Just_how_smart_are_smart_machines","303093913_Will_Computers_Put_Us_Out_of_Work","301280056_Rise_of_the_Machines_A_Critical_Consideration_of_Automated_Leadership_Decision_Making_in_Organizations","292321276_Winning_the_Race_With_Ever-Smarter_Machines","279400692_Taking_the_mystery_out_of_intuitive_decision_making","240104637_Making_Invisible_Work_Visible_Using_Social_Network_Analysis_to_Support_Strategic_Collaboration","269662495_In_The_Age_of_the_Smart_Machine_The_Future_of_Work_and_Power","257255825_When_should_I_trust_my_gut_Linking_domain_expertise_to_intuitive_decision-making_effectiveness","247570208_Using_the_Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator_to_Study_Managers_A_Literature_Review_and_Research_Agenda","242617110_Theories_of_Bounded_Rationality"]}
