{"id":"221102755_Parsing_Agglutinative_Word_Structures_And_Its_Application_To_Spelling_Checking_For_Turkish","abstract":"Most of the research on parsing natural languages has been concerned with English, or with other languages morphologically similar to English. Parsing agglutinative word structures has attracted relatively little attention most probably because agglutinative languages contain word structures of considerable complexity, and parsing words in such languages requires morphological analysis techniques. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a morphological root-driven parser for Turkish word structures which has been incorporated into a spelling checking kernel for on-line Turkish text. The agglutinative nature of the language and the resulting complex word formations. various phonetic harmony rules and subtle exceptions present certain difficulties not usually encountered in the spelling checking of languages like English and make this a very challenging problem.","authors":["Aysin Solak","Kemal Oflazer"],"meta":["January 1992","DOI:10.3115/992066.992075","SourceDBLP","Conference: Proceedings of the 14th conference on Computational linguistics - Volume 1"],"references":["242541851_An_experiment_with_automatic_morphological_analysis_of_finnish","30001157_Automatic_morphological_analysis_of_Basque","230876370_Computer-assisted_morphological_analysis_of_ancient_Greek","230876102_Morphological_Parsing_and_the_Lexicon","31008419_Design_and_Implementation_of_a_Spelling_Checker_for_Turkish"]}
