{"id":"315698515_Language_Independent_Code_Clone_Detection_Approach_Using_JSON_String_Parsing","abstract":"Cloning is an easy way of reusing the software. Some of the studies revealed that about 25-30 per cent of code in long term software development project may have been cloned. Though there are some benefits of software cloning but still software cloning is considered as a harmful practice. If there is an error in one code that is to be cloned then that error can be transferred to all the modules where cloning has been done. Cloning also increases the maintenance cost. So, the clone detection becomes an important part for project success. In this paper, a new language independent approach is proposed for code clone detection which will work on JSON (Java Script Object Notation) string parsing. This approach will trace code clones for nearly all the languages.","authors":["Gaurav Singh","Sandeep Kaur","Bhavneesh Sohal"],"meta":["December 2016International Journal of Control Theory and Applications 9(41):565-573"],"references":["236970991_An_Efficient_New_Multi-Language_Clone_Detection_Approach_from_Large_Source_Code","232625379_Scalable_and_Incremental_Clone_Detection_for_Evolving_Software","221907002_Code_Clone_Detection_Using_String_Based_Tree_Matching_Technique","313939769_Software_clone_detection_A_systematic_review_Information_and_Software_Technology","262255828_Increasing_clone_maintenance_support_by_unifying_clone_detection_and_refactoring_activities","260620603_CD-Form_A_clone_detector_based_on_formal_methods","254041580_Hot_clones_Combining_search-driven_development_clone_management_and_code_provenance","241175632_Extracting_the_similarity_in_detected_software_clones_using_metrics","224136434_Detection_of_Type-1_and_Type-2_Code_Clones_Using_Textual_Analysis_and_Metrics","222826061_Comparison_and_evaluation_of_code_clone_detection_techniques_and_tools_A_qualitative_approach"]}
