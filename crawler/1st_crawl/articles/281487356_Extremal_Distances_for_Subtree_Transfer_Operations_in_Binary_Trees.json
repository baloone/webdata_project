{"id":"281487356_Extremal_Distances_for_Subtree_Transfer_Operations_in_Binary_Trees","abstract":"Three standard subtree transfer operations for binary trees, used in\nparticular for phylogenetic trees, are: tree bisection and reconnection\n($TBR$), subtree prune and regraft ($SPR$) and rooted subtree prune and regraft\n($rSPR$). For a pair of leaf-labelled binary trees with $n$ leaves, the maximum\nnumber of such moves required to transform one into the other is\n$n-\\Theta(\\sqrt{n})$, extending a result of Ding, Grunewald and Humphries. We\nshow that if the pair is chosen uniformly at random, then the expected number\nof moves required to transfer one into the other is $n-\\Theta(n^{2/3})$. These\nresults may be phrased in terms of agreement forests: we also give extensions\nfor more than two binary trees.","authors":["Ross Atkins","Colin McDiarmid"],"meta":["March 2019Annals of Combinatorics 23(4)","DOI:10.1007/s00026-018-0410-4","SourcearXiv"],"references":["268819852_Bounds_on_the_Expected_Size_of_the_Maximum_Agreement_Subtree","243780284_Distributions_of_Tree_Comparison_Metrics--Some_New_Results","226475193_On_the_Computational_Complexity_of_the_Rooted_Subtree_Prune_and_Regraft_Distance","316517035_The_size_of_a_maximum_agreement_subtree_for_random_binary_trees","272675777_A_combinatorial_problem_in_geometry","271205405_PAUP_Phylogenetic_Analysis_Using_Parsimony_and_Other_Methods_Version_40b10","236736804_On_the_method_of_bounded_differences","235716557_Does_random_tree_puzzle_produce_Yule-Harding_trees_in_the_many-taxon_limit","227603950_Calculating_SPR_distances_between_trees","225671750_On_the_Combinatorics_of_Rooted_Binary_Phylogenetic_Trees"]}
