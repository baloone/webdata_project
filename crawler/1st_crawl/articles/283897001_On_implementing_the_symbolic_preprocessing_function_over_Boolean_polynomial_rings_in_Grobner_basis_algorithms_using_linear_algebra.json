{"id":"283897001_On_implementing_the_symbolic_preprocessing_function_over_Boolean_polynomial_rings_in_Grobner_basis_algorithms_using_linear_algebra","abstract":"Some techniques using linear algebra was introduced by Faugêre in F4 to speed up the reduction process during Gröbner basis computations. These techniques can also be used in fast implementations of F5 and some other signature-based Gröbner basis algorithms. When these techniques are applied, a very important step is constructing matrices from critical pairs and existing polynomials by the Symbolic Preprocessing function (given in F4). Since multiplications of monomials and polynomials are involved in the Symbolic Preprocessing function, this step can be very costly when the number of involved polynomials/monomials is huge. In this paper, multiplications of monomials and polynomials for a Boolean polynomial ring are investigated and a specific method of implementing the Symbolic Preprocessing function over Boolean polynomial rings is reported. Many examples have been tested by using this method, and the experimental data shows that the new method is very efficient.","authors":["Yao Sun","Zhenyu Huang","Dongdai Lin","Dingkang Wang"],"meta":["August 2015Journal of Systems Science and Complexity 29(3)","DOI:10.1007/s11424-015-4085-1"],"references":["261439599_An_Improvement_over_the_GVW_Algorithm_for_Inhomogeneous_Polynomial_Systems","221564782_Solving_systems_of_polynomial_equations_with_symmetries_using_SAGBI-Grobner_bases","278689710_The_Algorithm_Design_Manual","267662678_GVW_algorithm_over_principal_ideal_domains","242283769_Algorithms_for_Solving_Overdefined_Systems_of_Multivariate_Polynomial_Equations","239086442_A_New_Efficient_Algorithm_for_Computing_Grobner_Bases_F4","238694533_Gaussian_elimination_and_resolution_of_systems_of_algebraic_equations","234792420_A_new_efficient_algorithm_for_computing_Grobner_bases_without_reduction_to_zero_F_5","226565065_Grobner_bases_Gaussian_elimination_and_resolution_of_systems_of_algebraic_equations","221354723_Algebraic_Cryptanalysis_of_Hidden_Field_Equation_HFE_Cryptosystems_Using_Grobner_Bases"]}
