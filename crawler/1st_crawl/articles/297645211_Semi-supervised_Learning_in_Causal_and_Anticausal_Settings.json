{"id":"297645211_Semi-supervised_Learning_in_Causal_and_Anticausal_Settings","abstract":"We consider the problem of learning in the case where an underlying causal model can be inferred. Causal knowledge may facilitate some approaches for a given problem, and rule out others. We formulate the hypothesis that semi-supervised learning can help in an anti-causal setting, but not in a causal setting, and corroborate it with empirical results.","authors":["Bernhard Sch√∂lkopf","Dominik Janzing","Jonas Peters","Eleni Sgouritsa"],"meta":["October 2013","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-41136-6_13","In book: Empirical Inference (pp.129-141)"],"references":["242448131_Causation_Prediction_and_Search","228655021_Causal_models_as_minimal_descriptions_of_multivariate_systems","228095673_On_Causal_and_Anticausal_Learning","221706316_Inferring_deterministic_causal_relations","221619551_Nonlinear_causal_discovery_with_additive_noise_models","221619382_An_Empirical_Analysis_of_Domain_Adaptation_Algorithms_for_Genomic_Sequence_Analysis","221345474_Regression_by_dependence_minimization_and_its_application_to_causal_inference","221344687_Efficient_co-regularised_least_squares_regression","41782261_An_Empirical_Analysis_of_Domain_Adaptation_Algorithms_for_Genomic_Sequence_Analysis","41782220_Nonlinear_causal_discovery_with_additive_noise_models","270300308_Direct_Inference_and_Inverse_Inference","269832992_The_Direction_of_Time","267473321_When_Training_and_Test_Sets_Are_Different_Characterizing_Learning_Transfer","267169218_Estimation_of_dependences_based_on_empirical_data_Transl_from_the_Russian_by_Samuel_Kotz","243785682_Glossary_of_EpistemologyPhilosophy_of_Science","224174413_Causal_Inference_Using_the_Algorithmic_Markov_Condition","221602887_Transportability_of_Causal_and_Statistical_Relations_A_Formal_Approach","221405014_On_the_Identifiability_of_the_Post-Nonlinear_Causal_Model","220765748_An_Extensive_Empirical_Study_on_Semi-supervised_Learning","220696326_Introduction_to_Semi-Supervised_Learning","49549722_The_Direction_of_Time","41781562_Semi-Supervised_Learning","2355850_Learning_With_Labeled_and_Unlabeled_Data"]}
