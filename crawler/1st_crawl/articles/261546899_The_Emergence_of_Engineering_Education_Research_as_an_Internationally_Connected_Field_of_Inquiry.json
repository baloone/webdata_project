{"id":"261546899_The_Emergence_of_Engineering_Education_Research_as_an_Internationally_Connected_Field_of_Inquiry","abstract":"Background\nIn recent years, engineering education research (EER) has emerged as an internationally connected field of inquiry through the establishment of EER conferences, interest groups within engineering education societies, Ph.D. programs, and departments and centers at universities. Improving the preparation and training of engineers through EER is critical to solving major engineering challenges in sustainability, climate change, civil infrastructure, energy, and public health. PurposeThe purpose of this article is twofold: (1) to introduce EER as a field of inquiry, and (2) to describe the U.S. and Northern and Central European approaches to EER as two examples of the diversity of approaches. Scope/Method\nThe article is organized around a framework from the European didaktik tradition, which focuses on answering the w-questions of education. The major sections describe what, why, to what end, where, who, and how EER is conducted. Conclusion\nNorthern and Central European educational approaches focus on authentic, complex problems, while U.S. approaches emphasize empirical evidence. Additionally, disciplinary boundaries and legitimacy are more salient issues in the U.S., while the Northern and Central European Bildung philosophy integrates across disciplines toward development of the whole person. Understanding and valuing complementary perspectives is critical to growth and internationalization of EER.","authors":["Maura Borrego","Jonte Bernhard"],"meta":["January 2011Journal of Engineering
