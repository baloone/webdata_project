{"id":"321932069_Academic_Advising_Systems_A_Systematic_Literature_Review_of_Empirical_Evidence","abstract":"This paper aims to provide the reader with a comprehensive background for understanding current knowledge on Academic Advising Systems (AAS) and its impact on learning. It constitutes an overview of empirical evidence behind key objectives of the potential adoption of AAS in generic educational strategic planning. The researchers examined the literature on experimental case studies conducted in the domain during the past ten years (2008â€“2017). Search terms identified 98 mature pieces of research work, but inclusion criteria limited the key studies to 43. The authors analyzed the research questions, methodology, and findings of these published papers and categorized them accordingly. The results have highlighted three distinct major directions of the AAS empirical research. This paper discusses the emerged added value of AAS research and highlights the significance of further implications. Finally, the authors set their thoughts on possible uncharted key questions to investigate both from pedagogical and technical considerations.","authors":["Omiros Iatrellis","Achilles Kameas","Panos Fitsilis"],"meta":["December 2017Education Sciences 7(4):90","DOI:10.3390/educsci7040090","Project: ECUCATE"],"references":["305627418_A_Hybrid_Course_Recommendation_System_by_Integrating_Collaborative_Filtering_and_Artificial_Immune_Systems","285397553_University_course_advising_Overcoming_the_challenges_using_decision_support_system","344751429_Redesigning_America's_Community_Colleges_A_Clearer_Path_to_Student_Success","335879876_A_Conceptual_Framework_of_Web-based_Academic_Advisory_Information_System","304808449_Interactive_decision_support_for_academic_advising","304342231_Student_advising_and_planning_software","292970247_An_Intelligent_Student_Advising_System_Using_Collaborative_Filtering","292019240_Annals_of_Mathematical_Statistics","288890117_Personalized_Course_Sequence_Recommendations","286662568_Course-recommendation_system_based_on_ontology"]}
