{"id":"315799299_Critical_news_reading_with_Twitter_Exploring_data-mining_practices_and_their_impact_on_societal_discourse","abstract":"This article shows that the collaboration between social science and\ncomputer science scholars proves fruitful in enhancing conceptual and methodological\ninnovation in research appropriate for the digital world. It presents\narguments for ways in which a multi-disciplinary approach can strengthen media\nstudies and innovatively advance both research breadth and depth. To illustrate\nthis interesting connection of both disciplines, we present the example\nanalysis of large data from Twitter and discuss this analysis in a communication\nscience research environment. We propose TwiNeR, a software tool that\nanalyzes tweet content using an advanced language modeling approach for\nclassifying tweets into five prototypical messages referring to ‘activities’ related\nto news and news sources in the Twitter network (i.e., source-fed article, userfed\narticle, content spread by user, other source content, other user content)","authors":["Mathias Verbeke","Bettina Berendt","Leen d'Haenens","Michael Opgenhaffen"],"meta":["April 2017Communications 42(2):127-149","DOI:10.1515/commun-2017-0014"],"references":["277007765_Mastering_The_Information_Age_-_Solving_Problems_with_Visual_Analytics","267252690_Analysis_of_social_networking_sites_A_study_on_effective_communication_strategy_in_developing_brand_communication","316806338_Twitter_Data_Analytics","313385761_Data_Mining_Practical_Machine_Learning_Tools_and_Techniques","279406848_Tools_and_methods_for_capturing_Twitter_data_during_natural_disasters","264732385_Campaigning_on_Twitter_Microblogging_and_Online_Social_Networking_as_Campaign_Tools_in_the_2010_General_Elections_in_the_Netherlands","264645964_Affective_News_and_Networks_Publics_The_Rhythms_of_News_Storytelling_on_Egypt","264340811_Social_Media_and_the_Decision_to_Participate_in_Political_Protest_Observations_From_Tahrir_Square","263335307_Researching_News_Discussion_on_Twitter","262314169_Streaming_trend_detection_in_Twitter"]}
