{"id":"338345880_On_Marshall-Olkin_Extended_Inverse_Weibull_Distribution_Properties_and_Estimation_Using_Type-II_Censoring_Data","abstract":"In this paper, we introduce a new model of lifetime distributions which is called Marshall-Olkin extended inverse Weibull\n(MOEIW) distribution. The reliability analysis of the new model is examined by means of various functions which include a compound\nof survival function, reversed hazard rate function, mean inactivity time and strong mean inactivity time. Some statistical properties\nof the MOEIW distribution are explored, such as entropy, order statistics, stochastic orderings, Bonferroni, Lorenz curves and size\nbiased model. Moreover, the estimation of the MOEIW parameters is discussed by using the maximum likelihood estimation method\nwith Type-II censoring data. Simulation results investigate the performance of the estimates. Also, application of the MOEIW to a real\ndata set and its goodness-of-fit are demonstrated to illustrate the flexibility of the new model. Example and applications as well as\ncomparisons to other models are carried out.","authors":["Hassan Okasha","Ali El-Baz","Abdulkareem M.
