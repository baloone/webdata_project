{"id":"224223550_The_NumPy_Array_A_Structure_for_Efficient_Numerical_Computation","abstract":"In the Python world, NumPy arrays are the standard representation for numerical data and enable efficient implementation of numerical computations in a high-level language. As this effort shows, NumPy performance can be improved through three techniques: vectorizing calculations, avoiding copying data in memory, and minimizing operation counts.","authors":["St√©fan Johann van der Walt","S.
