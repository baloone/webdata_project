{"id":"260557412_Cyclic_Orbit_Codes_and_Stabilizer_Subfields","abstract":"Cyclic orbit codes are constant dimension subspace codes that arise as the\norbit of a cyclic subgroup of the general linear group acting on subspaces in\nthe given ambient space. With the aid of the largest subfield over which the\ngiven subspace is a vector space, the cardinality of the orbit code can be\ndetermined, and estimates for its distance can be found. This subfield is\nclosely related to the stabilizer of the generating subspace. Finally, with a\nlinkage construction larger, and longer, constant dimension codes can be\nderived from cyclic orbit codes without compromising the distance.","authors":["Heide Gluesing-Luerssen","Katherine Morrison","Carolyn Troha"],"meta":["March 2014Advances in Mathematics of Communications 9(2)","DOI:10.3934/amc.2015.9.177","SourcearXiv"],"references":["259692531_Construction_of_Large_Constant_Dimension_Codes_with_a_Prescribed_Minimum_Distance","236635083_Existence_of_q-Analogs_of_Steiner_Systems","235008632_Theory_of_codes_with_maximum_rank_distance_translation","225044971_Isometry_and_Automorphisms_of_Constant_Dimension_Codes","224324772_Error-Correcting_Codes_in_Projective_Space","220963181_Subspace_Codes","267118409_On_q-analogs_of_Steiner_systems_and_covering_designs","227331894_Decoding_of_random_network_codes","224078326_On_Metrics_for_Error_Correction_in_Network_Coding","220682991_Network_Information_Flow"]}
