{"id":"281144990_Topological_Representation_of_Intuitionistic_and_Distributive_Abstract_Logics","abstract":"We continue work of our earlier paper (Lewitzka and Brunner: Minimally\ngenerated abstract logics, Logica Universalis 3(2), 2009), where abstract\nlogics and particularly intuitionistic abstract logics are studied. Abstract\nlogics can be topologized in a direct and natural way. This facilitates a\ntopological study of classes of concrete logics whenever they are given in\nabstract form. Moreover, such a direct topological approach avoids the often\ncomplex algebraic and lattice-theoretic machinery usually applied to represent\nlogics. Motivated by that point of view, we define in this paper the category\nof intuitionistic abstract logics with stable logic maps as morphisms, and the\ncategory of implicative spectral spaces with spectral maps as morphisms. We\nshow the equivalence of these categories and conclude that the larger\ncategories of distributive abstract logics and distributive sober spaces are\nequivalent, too.","authors":["Andreas Bernhard Michael Brunner","Steffen Lewitzka"],"meta":["June 2017Logica Universalis 11(2)","DOI:10.1007/s11787-017-0166-3","SourcearXiv"],"references":["261673032_Towards_a_good_notion_of_categories_of_logics","243704264_Intuitionistic_Logic_Model_Theory_and_Forcing","285521048_Abstract_logics","284687049_Der_Minimalkalkul_ein_reduzierter_intuitionistischer_Formalismus","277170422_Propositional_Consequence_Relations_and_Algebraic_Logic","268797823_Completeness_for_intermediate_logics","268700640_Classical_Abstract_Logics","265585026_An_introduction_to_partially_ordered_structures_and_sheaves","265438215_Algebraizable_Logics","244490937_Prime_Ideal_Structure_in_Commutative_Rings","226062045_Minimally_Generated_Abstract_Logics","225401569_Topo-canonical_completions_of_closure_algebras_and_Heyting_algebras","238736232_An_Algebraic_Approach_to_Non-Classical_Logics","226827102_Abstract_Logics_Logic_Maps_and_Logic_Homomorphisms","226557379_Equipollent_Logical_Systems"]}
