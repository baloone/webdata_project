{"id":"262452266_Robustness_of_Time_Reversal_vs_All-Rake_Transceivers_in_Multiple_Access_Channels","abstract":"Time reversal, that is prefiltering of transmitted signals with time reversed\nchannel impulse responses, may be used in single user communications in order\nto move complexity from the receiver to the transmitter, and in multiuser\ncommunications to also modify statistical properties of multiuser interference.\nImperfect channel estimation may, however, affect pre- vs. post- filtering\nschemes in a different way. This issue is the object of this paper; Robustness\nof time reversal vs. All-Rake (AR) transceivers, in multiple access\ncommunications, with respect to channel estimation errors, is investigated.\nResults of performance analyses in terms of symbol error probability and\nspectral efficiency when the receiver is structured either by a bank of matched\nfilters or by 1Rake, followed by independent decoders, indicate that AR is\nslightly more robust than time reversal but requires in practice more complex\nchannel estimation procedures since all channels must be simultaneously\ninferred in the multiuser communication setting.","authors":["Guido Carlo Ferrante","Jocelyn Fiorina","Maria-Gabriella Di Benedetto"],"meta":["June 2018Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing 2018(8)","DOI:10.1155/2018/7548926","SourcearXiv"],"references":["313886345_Performance_Evaluation_of_Non-prefiltering_vs_Time_Reversal_Prefiltering_in_Distributed_and_Uncoordinated_IR-UWB_Ad-Hoc_Networks","286930645_From_D2D_to_Ds2D_Prolonging_the_Battery_Life_of_Mobile_Devices_via_Ds2D_Communications","268420637_On_the_Equivalence_of_Prerake_and_Transmit_Matched_Filter","284739687_Some_Equivalence_Theorems_of_Electromagnetics_and_their_Application_to_Radiation_Problems","274514835_Performance_of_ultra-wideband_time-reversal_systems_under_imperfect_channel_side_information_at_the_transmitter","273169767_Robust_Feedback_Design_for_Time_Reversal_UWB_Communication_Systems_Under_CSIT_Imperfections","261461273_Time_reversal_beamforming_in_MISO-UWB_channels","261022687_Time-reversal_against_optimum_precoder_over_frequency-selective_channels","258791973_An_Information_Theoretic_Take_on_Time_Reversal_for_Nonstationary_Channels","258047304_Effect_of_channel_estimation_error_on_performance_of_time_reversal-UWB_communication_system_and_its_compensation_by_pre-filter","257674874_Effect_of_Channel_Estimation_Error_on_Time_Reversal_UWB_Communication_System","257667677_Combining_UWB_with_Time_Reversal_for_improved_communication_and_positioning","252054608_Impact_of_Time_Reversal_on_multi-user_interference_in_IR-UWB","251384029_Time_Reversal_with_MISO_for_Ultra-Wideband_Communications_Experimental_Results_invited_paper","248863711_Coding_for_Wireless_Channels"]}
