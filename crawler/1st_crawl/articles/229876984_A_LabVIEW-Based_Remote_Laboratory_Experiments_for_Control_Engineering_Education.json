{"id":"229876984_A_LabVIEW-Based_Remote_Laboratory_Experiments_for_Control_Engineering_Education","abstract":"This paper deals with remote access to a real laboratory equipment using contemporary computer and network technology for creating the environment that will enable a remote user to perform the required laboratory exercises and control the laboratory equipment. Architecture and characteristics of WebLab will be described with special attention to the latest implemented laboratory experiment for control of the coupled water tanks (using LabVIEW). This paper will also give results of researches among student population in order to determine advantages and effects of using web laboratory in control engineering education. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
