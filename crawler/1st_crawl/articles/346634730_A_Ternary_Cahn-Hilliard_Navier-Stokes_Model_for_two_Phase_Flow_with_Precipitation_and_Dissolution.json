{"id":"346634730_A_Ternary_Cahn-Hilliard_Navier-Stokes_Model_for_two_Phase_Flow_with_Precipitation_and_Dissolution","abstract":"We consider the incompressible flow of two immiscible fluids in the presence of a solid phase that undergoes changes in time due to precipitation and dissolution effects. Based on a seminal sharp interface model a phase-field approach is suggested that couples the Navier–Stokes equations and the solid’s ion concentration transport equation with the Cahn–Hilliard evolution for the phase fields.\nThe model is shown to preserve the fundamental conservation constraints and to obey the second law of thermodynamics for a novel free energy formulation. An extended analysis for vanishing interfacial width reveals that in this limit the sharp interface model is recovered, including all relevant transmission conditions. Notably, the new phase-field model is able to realize Navier-slip conditions for solid–fluid interfaces in the limit.","authors":["Christian Rohde","Lars von Wolff"],"meta":["November 2020Mathematical Models and Methods in Applied Sciences 31(01)","DOI:10.1142/S0218202521500019"],"references":["320619582_Sharp-interface_limits_of_a_phase-field_model_with_a_generalized_Navier_slip_boundary_condition_for_moving_contact_lines","313674333_A_phase_field_approach_to_shape_optimization_in_Navier--Stokes_flow_with_integral_state_constraint","275636518_Hierarchy_of_consistent_n-component_Cahn-Hilliard_systems","238552404_Study_of_a_three_component_Cahn-Hilliard_flow_model","225214382_On_three-phase_boundary_motion_and_the_singular_limit_of_a_vector-valued_Ginzburg-Landau_equation","222271328_An_analysis_of_crystal_dissolution_fronts_in_flows_through_porous_media_Part_1_Compatible_boundary_conditions","51156664_Solving_PDES_in_complex_geometries_A_diffuse_domain_approach","51021923_Thermodynamically_Consistent_Frame_Indifferent_Diffuse_Interface_Modelsfor_Incompressible_Two-Phase_Flows_with_Different_Densities","47646394_Thermodynamically_Consistent_Diffuse_Interface_Models_for_Incompressible_Two-Phase_Flows_with_Different_Densities","42621195_Cahn-HilliardNavier-Stokes_Model_for_the_Simulation_of_Three-Phase_Flows","10600758_Molecular_scale_contact_line_hydrodynamics_of_immiscible_flows","5226873_Phase-field_modeling_of_solute_precipitation_and_dissolution","1850335_A_variational_approach_to_moving_contact_line_hydrodynamics","342115724_Phase_Field_Modeling_of_Precipitation_and_Dissolution_Processes_in_Porous_Media_Upscaling_and_Numerical_Experiments","308830734_Upscaling_of_a_tri-phase_phase-field_model_for_precipitation_in_porous_media","280990825_Cahn-Hilliard_Navier-Stokes_model_for_the_simulation_of_three-phase_flows","268667779_Phase_change_flows_with_mass_exchange","267192938_Sharp_interface_limit_of_phase_change_flows","267147955_Generic_implementation_of_finite_element_methods_in_the_Distributed_and_Unified_Numerics_Environment_DUNE","266595908_Phase_field_approximation_of_a_kinetic_moving-boundary_problem_modelling_dissolution_and_precipitation","264276398_The_DUNE-ALUGrid_Module","258505479_Front_Migration_in_the_Nonlinear_Cahn-Hilliard_Equation","254909631_An_analysis_of_crystal_dissolution_fronts_in_flows_through_porous_media","251267769_Quasi-incompressible_Cahn-Hilliard_fluids_and_topological_transitions","242913157_Dynamics_of_Layered_Interfaces_Arising_from_Phase_Boundaries","239786331_Solving_pdes_in_complex_geometries","232330702_On_the_problem_of_dynamic_contact_angle","231964469_The_Cahn-Hilliard_gradient_theory_for_phase_separation_with_non-smooth_free_energy_Part_I_Mathematical_analysis","231501212_Films_The_Spreading_of_Liquids_and_the_Spreading_Coefficient","222830703_Diffuse_interface_modeling_of_two-phase_flows_based_on_averaging_Mass_and_momentum_equations","222666436_A_phase-field_model_of_solidification_with_convection","222497298_On_Anisotropic_Order_Parameter_Models_For_Multi-Phase_Systems_And_Their_Sharp_Interface_Limits","222451389_Modeling_Melt_Convection_in_Phase-Field_Simulations_of_Solidification","222427726_A_continuous_surface_tension_force_formulation_for_diffuse-interface_models","200104742_Theory_of_Dynamic_Critical_Phenomena","11663410_Phase_Field_Model_for_Three-Dimensional_Dendritic_Growth_with_Fluid_Flow"]}
