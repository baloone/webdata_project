{"id":"329122629_The_Game_as_a_Talking_Tool_Using_a_Board_Game_for_Creative_Consultation_Engagement_and_Inclusion_Creativity_Engagement_and_the_Student_Experience","abstract":"The ‘Discuss This!’ game was devised by Carol Bristow from Lancashire Care NHS Trust with support from Bev Lamey and other academics in the University of Central Lancashire (UCLan) School of Art, Design and Performance. It was initially developed as part of a Supportive Environments Encouraging Development (SEED) project in a Low Secure Mental Health Unit. The game was used as a quick, informal and homemade method of involving mental health service users in the design of their hospital environment. The advantage of the board game format is that it is familiar and unthreatening. There is a prize for the winner (an enticement to join in), and most importantly everyone takes a turn to answer a question and thereby contribute to the information gathered.","authors":["Bev Lamey","Carol Bristow"],"meta":["January 2015","DOI:10.1057/9781137402141_23","In book: Creative Education, Teaching and Learning (pp.243-253)"],"references":["23187857_Online_Video_Game_Therapy_for_Mental_Health_Concerns_A_Review","16312692_Stacking_the_deck_Teaching_social_skills_to_retarded_adults_with_a_modified_table_game","270805846_Nurse_as_Educator_Principles_of_Teaching_and_Learning","20661451_Gaming_A_Teaching_Strategy_for_Adult_Learners","12071931_Creating_a_Game_for_Sexuality_and_Aging_The_Sexual_Dysfunction_Trivia_Game"]}
