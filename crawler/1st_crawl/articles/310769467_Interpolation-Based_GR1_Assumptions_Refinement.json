{"id":"310769467_Interpolation-Based_GR1_Assumptions_Refinement","abstract":"This paper considers the problem of assumptions refinement in the context of unrealizable specifications for reactive systems. We propose a new counterstrategy-guided synthesis approach for GR(1) specifications based on Craig's interpolants. Our interpolation-based method identifies causes for unrealizability and computes assumptions that directly targets unrealizable cores, without the need for user input. We describe properties of interpolants that yield helpful assumptions in GR(1) and prove the soundness of the results. We demonstrate, through experiments, that our approach converges more quickly than other techniques, and yields weaker assumptions.","authors":["Davide G.
