{"id":"342788795_A_literature_review_on_hybrid_flow_shop_scheduling","abstract":"Scheduling problems are one of the widely used problems which\nhave both academic and real-life applications. In academic fields, it can be used to test the efficiency of a newly developed solution techniques. As it is known to be NP-hard, these problems are keystones to show the performance of a new or improved method, especially metaheuristics. Apart from the standard scheduling problems, one of its challenging sub-problem is hybrid flow shop\n(HFS) scheduling. Except from the literature survey of Ruiz and\nVázquez-Rodríguez (2010), no recent analysis is given to give the new solution trends in HFS. To solve this missing piece, in this study 219 HFS articles from 2010–2019 period are analyzed with the main focus of metaheuristic techniques. Also, analysis based on the citations are given.","authors":["Ömür Tosun","Marichelvam Mariappan Kadarkarainadar","Nedret Tosun"],"meta":["January 2020International Journal of Advanced Operations
