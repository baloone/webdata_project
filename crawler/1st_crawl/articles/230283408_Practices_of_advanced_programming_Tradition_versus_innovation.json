{"id":"230283408_Practices_of_advanced_programming_Tradition_versus_innovation","abstract":"This paper compares two different approaches for teaching complex programming concepts in lab sessions. The first approach is based on the widely held assumption that the programming knowledge and skills which the student obtains are predominantly acquired from classroom activities undertaken at the instigation of the teacher. This automatically implies that the student must attend a minimum number of lab sessions. The second approach is to motivate student learning via a full-term activity based on the implementation of computer games from scratch. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
