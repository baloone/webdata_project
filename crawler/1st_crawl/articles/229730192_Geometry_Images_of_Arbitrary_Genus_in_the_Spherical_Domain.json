{"id":"229730192_Geometry_Images_of_Arbitrary_Genus_in_the_Spherical_Domain","abstract":"While existing spherical parameterization algorithms are limited to genus-0 geometrical models, we believe a wide class of models of arbitrary genus can also benefit from the spherical domain. We present a complete and robust pipeline that can generate spherical geometry images from arbitrary genus surfaces where the holes are explicitly represented. The geometrical model, represented as a triangle mesh, is first made topologically equivalent to a sphere by cutting each hole along its generators, thus performing genus reduction. The resulting genus-0 model is then parameterized on the sphere, where it is resampled in a way to preserve connectivity between holes and to reduce the visual impact of seams due to these holes. Knowing the location of each pair of boundary components in parametric space, our novel sampling scheme can automatically choose to scale down or completely eliminate the associated hole, depending on geometry image resolution, thus lowering the genus of the reconstructed model. We found our method to scale better than other geometry image algorithms for higher genus models. We illustrate our approach on remeshing, level-of-detail rendering, normal mapping and topology editing.","authors":["M.
