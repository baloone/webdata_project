{"id":"262324871_History_dependent_verification_for_partial_order_systems","abstract":"We propose a new approach to check bisimulation-based equivalences for models of concurrency which take into account causal dependencies between the actions a system can perform. The existing approaches are based on special definitions of bisimulation and do not allow for reuse of techniques and tools developed for ordinary labeled transition systems. This is not the case in our approach, since we map causal systems into ordinary transition systems. As a consequence, we obtain minimal realizations and Hennessy-Milner logics also for causal systems. We show how our approach applies to history-preserving bisimulation for Petri nets and to location equivalence for CCS.","authors":["Ugo Montanari","Marco Pistore"],"meta":["February 1997","Conference: Proceedings of the DIMACS workshop on Partial order methods in verification"],"references":[]}
