{"id":"310494487_Bringing_Science_to_Life","abstract":"This chapter addresses four important areas in the use and effects of context-based approaches in the teaching of science. The first part of the chapter considers the nature of context-based approaches. The second part of the chapter draws on a synthesis of a range of research studies to explore the impact of context-based approaches on studentâ€™s cognitive and affective responses to science ideas. The third part of the chapter considers some of the issues raised by the review on research into the effects of context-based approaches.","authors":["Judith Bennett"],"meta":["January 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-94-6300-684-2_2","In book: Teachers Creating Context-Based Learning Environments in Science (pp.21-39)"],"references":["267819500_Excellence_in_Research_on_Schools","237330558_A_systematic_review_of_the_effects_of_context-based_and_Science-Technology-Society_STS_approaches_in_the_teaching_of_secondary_science","46119026_Chemie_im_Kontext_A_symbiotic_implementation_of_a_context-based_teaching_and_learning_approach","44836144_Inside_the_Black_Box_Raising_Standards_Through_Classroom_Assessment","40886517_Participation_in_Science_Mathematics_and_Technology_in_Australian_Education","33041351_Systematic_Reviews_of_Research_in_Science_Education","318775044_Achievement_of_Swazi_students_learning_science_through_everyday_technology","292705342_Teaching_as_a_Research-based_Profession_possibilities_and_prospects","281549555_Working_inside_the_black_box_Raising_standards_through_classroom_assessment","266731427_Realistic_Evaluation","265102218_Context-based_Learning_for_Students_and_Teachers_Professional_development_by_participating_in_school_innovation_projects","259599158_Non-science_oriented_students_and_the_second_law_of_thermodynamics","252378083_Scope_sequence_and_coordination_The_Iowa_Project_a_national_reform_effort_in_the_USA","248974696_Students'_versus_their_teachers'_beliefs_and_positions_on_ScienceTechnologySociety_SST-oriented_issues","240526595_The_development_of_an_alternative_in-service_programme_for_Korean_science_teachers_with_an_emphasis_on_science-technology-society","238400548_Teachers'_Continuing_Professional_Development_Framing_a_model_of_outcomes","234757674_A_Study_on_Classroom_Environment_and_on_Cognitive_and_Affective_Outcomes_of_the_PLON-Curriculum","233469015_How_does_a_context-based_approach_influence_understanding_of_key_chemical_ideas_at_16","233309434_The_effects_of_STS-oriented_instruction_on_female_tenth_graders'_cognitive_structure_outcomes_and_the_role_of_student_scientific_epistemological_beliefs","233054839_Concept_Development_and_Transfer_in_Context-Based_Science_Education","232854968_Science_technology_and_society_in_transition_year_A_pilot_study","231262791_Comparing_Achievement_of_Inner-City_High_School_Students_in_Traditional_versus_STS-Based_Chemistry_Courses","229913521_Goal_attainment_in_science-technology-society_STS_education_and_reality_The_case_of_British_Columbia","229639633_The_effect_of_infusing_STS_vignettes_into_the_genetics_unit_of_biology_on_learner_outcomes_in_STS_and_genetics","227748165_The_Need_for_Randomised_Controlled_Trials_in_Educational_Research","227662894_Bringing_science_to_life_A_synthesis_of_the_research_evidence_on_the_effects_of_context-based_and_STS_approaches_to_science_teaching","225256880_Socio-Scientific_Discussions_as_a_Way_to_Improve_the_Comprehension_of_Science_and_the_Understanding_of_the_Interrelation_between_Species_and_the_Environment","47524936_Student_perception_and_appraisal_of_the_learning_environment_Core_concepts_in_the_evaluation_of_the_PLON_physics_curriculum","46119024_On_the_Nature_of_Context_in_Chemical_Education","44847045_Statistical_power_ANALYSIS_for_the_Behavioral_sciences","36041225_Comparison_of_formal_operations_students_enrolled_in_ChemCom_versus_a_traditional_chemistry_course","34504358_Student_perceptions_of_chemical_industry_influences_of_course_syllabi_teachers_firsthand_experience"]}
