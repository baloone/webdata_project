{"id":"326560018_Optimizing_tasks_generation_for_children_in_the_early_stages_of_literacy_teaching_a_study_using_bio-inspired_metaheuristics","abstract":"Behavioral teaching procedures can be used to promote the individualized learning of reading skills for children, and computational processes can assist instructors in the generation of a set of tasks. However, the automatic generation of these tasks can be unfeasible due to the high-order search space for the possible combinations of tasks; this complexity increases when considering the possible constraints as well as adapting the tasks to the individual characteristics of each student. This paper presents a new method to automatically generate teaching matching-to-sample tasks, adapting the difficulty by using bio-inspired optimization metaheuristics. Genetic algorithms, ant colony optimization, and integer and categorical particle swarm optimization were evaluated to determine their stability and capacity to generate adapted tasks. A comparison of the results between the algorithms showed a better rate of convergence for the genetic algorithms, which were able to generate tasks at an adapted level of difficulty to students. These tasks were applied to a group of students at a Brazilian public school in the early stages of a literacy course indicating satisfactory effects in the individual learning process.","authors":["Gilberto Nerino de Souza Jr","Daniel Felipe de Deus","Vincent Tadaiesky","Igor Ara√∫jo"],"meta":["October 2018Soft Computing 22(3)","DOI:10.1007/s00500-018-3409-1"],"references":["304578047_A_zSlices-based_general_type-2_fuzzy_logic_system_for_users-centric_adaptive_learning_in_large-scale_e-learning_platforms","313790690_An_Evolutionary_Approach_for_Personalization_of_Content_Delivery_in_e-Learning_Systems_based_on_Learner_Behavior_Forcing_Compatibility_of_Learning_Materials","313749844_Particle_swarm_optimization","313706874_Adaptation_in_natural_and_artificial_systems","312907789_Ant_system_Optimization_by_a_colony_of_cooperating_agents","312771295_Image_quality_assessment_From_error_visibility_to_structural_similarity","305714262_Single_loop_or_double_loop_learning_English_vocabulary_learning_performance_and_behavior_of_students_in_situated_computer_games_with_different_guiding_strategies","305685412_A_New_Discrete_Particle_Swarm_Optimization_Algorithm","303873735_An_ACO-based_personalized_learning_technique_in_support_of_people_with_Acquired_Brain_Injury","299402216_Derived_Equivalence_Relations_of_Geometry_Skills_in_Students_with_Autism_an_Application_of_the_PEAK-E_Curriculum","275354633_A_equivalencia_de_estimulos_como_modelo_do_significado","288737591_Equivalence_Class_Formation_Via_Common_Reinforcers_Among_Preschool_Children","286657441_Use_of_adaptive_study_material_in_education_in_E-learning_environment","283009481_Item_Difficulty_Estimation_an_Auspicious_Collaboration_Between_Data_and_Judgement","276444655_Scaffolding_individual_and_collaborative_game-based_learning_in_learning_performance_and_intrinsic_motivation"]}
