{"id":"327948787_Special-purpose_computer_HORN-8_for_phase-type_electro-holography","abstract":"Electro-holography is a promising display technology that can reconstruct a photorealistic three-dimensional (3D) movie; however, it is yet to be realized practically owing to the need for enormous calculation power. A special-purpose computer for electro-holography, namely HORN, has been studied for over 20 years as a means to solve this problem. The latest version of HORN, HORN-8, was developed using field programmable gate array (FPGA) technology. Initially, a circuit for amplitude-type electro-holography was implemented in HORN-8; however, implementation of phase-type electro-holography has remained an issue. In this paper, the development of new version of HORN-8 and its cluster system, which achieved a real-time reconstruction of a 3D movie with point clouds comprised of 32,000 points for phase-type electro-holography, was reported.","authors":["Takashi Nishitsuji","Yota Yamamoto","Takashige Sugie","Takanori Akamatsu"],"meta":["October 2018Optics Express 26(20):26722","DOI:10.1364/OE.26.026722"],"references":["324444738_High-performance_parallel_computing_for_next-generation_holographic_imaging","261520146_MPEG-based_novel_look-up_table_for_rapid_generation_of_video_holograms_of_fast-moving_three-dimensional_objects","43050853_Fast_CGH_computation_using_S-LUT_on_GPU","40443384_Extremely_high-definition_full-parallax_computer-generated_hologram_created_by_the_polygon-based_method","2766592_Interactive_Computation_of_Holograms_Using_a_Look-Up_Table","313734268_Review_of_Fast_Calculation_Techniques_for_Computer-Generated_Holograms_With_the_Point-Light-Source-Based_Model","290978069_Review_of_Fast_Algorithms_and_Hardware_Implementations_on_Computer_Holography","286489089_Simple_and_fast_cosine_approximation_method_for_computer-generated_hologram_calculation","282402773_Hardware_architecture_for_full_analytical_Fraunhofer_computer-generated_holograms","273793416_Fast_generation_of_digital_holograms_based_on_warping_of_the_wavefront_recording_plane","267815782_Real-time_spatiotemporal_division_multiplexing_electroholography_with_a_single_graphics_processing_unit_utilizing_movie_features","256488003_Fast_computation_of_computer-generated_hologram_using_Xeon_Phi_coprocessor","242806845_Special-purpose_computer_for_holography_HORN3_with_PLD_technology","242806744_Special_Purpose_Computer_HORN-1_for_Reconstruction_of_Virtual_Image_in_Three_Dimensions","232086810_Real-time_capture_and_reconstruction_system_with_multiple_GPUs_for_a_3D_live_scene_by_a_generation_from_4K_IP_images_to_8K_holograms","229344824_Special-purpose_computer_for_holography_HORN-2","223470648_Special-purpose_computer_for_holography_HORN-4_with_recurrence_algorithm","222746241_An_efficient_computational_method_suitable_for_hardware_of_computer-generated_hologram_with_phase_computation_by_addition","221094439_A_QoE_Fuzzy_Routing_Protocol_for_Wireless_Mesh_Networks","51927946_Computational_wave_optics_library_for_C_CWO_library","47404128_Rapid_calculation_algorithm_of_Fresnel_computer-generated-hologram_using_look-up_table_and_wavefront-recording_plane_methods_for_three-dimensional_display","41467019_Stereoscopic_approach_to_3_D_display_using_computer_generated_holograms","38019397_Simple_and_fast_calculation_algorithm_for_computer-generated_hologram_with_wavefront_recording_plane","26273295_Computer_generated_holography_using_a_graphics_processing_unit","26265442_Special-purpose_computer_HORN-5_for_a_real-time_electroholography","23466674_Fast_generation_of_three-dimensional_video_holograms_by_combined_use_of_data_compression_and_lookup_table_techniques","23324079_A_New_Microscope_Principle","7022292_Calculation_of_holograms_from_elemental_images_captured_by_integral_photography","5257950_Effective_generation_of_digital_holograms_of_three-dimensional_objects_using_a_novel_look-up_table_method"]}
