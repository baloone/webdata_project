{"id":"250745558_Formalizing_Basic_Complex_Analysis","abstract":"We describe the formalization of some of the basics of complex analysis in the HOL Light theorem prover. Besides being a beautiful area of mathematics, this has many potential applications, e.g. in analytic number theory. We have endeavoured to set up the kind of general analytic machinery that would make such applications feasible. 0 Mizar and me: some personal recollections The first time I saw mention of the Mizar project was in a message from Bob Boyer","authors":["John Harrison"],"meta":["January 2007"],"references":["1958503_A_formally_verified_proof_of_the_prime_number_theorem","279383626_Graduate_Texts_in_Mathematics","266935770_Developments_in_topological_analysis","265332381_A_Riemann-Type_Integral_of_Lebesgue_Power","230625839_Introduction_to_HOL_A_Theorem_Proving_Environment_for_Higher_Order_Logic","221302385_On_the_Implementation_of_an_Extensible_Declarative_Proof_Language","220694030_Theorem_Proving_with_the_Real_Numbers","31593206_A_mizar_mode_for_HOL","2633650_DECLARE_A_prototype_declarative_proof_system_for_higher_order_logic","2632656_Proof_Style","2611233_Isar_-_A_Generic_Interpretative_Approach_to_Readable_Formal_Proof_Documents"]}
