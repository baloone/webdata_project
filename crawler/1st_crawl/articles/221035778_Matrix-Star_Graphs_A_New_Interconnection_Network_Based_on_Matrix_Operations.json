{"id":"221035778_Matrix-Star_Graphs_A_New_Interconnection_Network_Based_on_Matrix_Operations","abstract":"In this paper, we introduce new interconnection networks matrix-star graphs\nMTS\nn1,...,nk\nwhere a node is represented by n\n1 × ... × n\nk\nmatrix and an edge is defined by using matrix operations. A matrix-star graph MTS\n2,n can be viewed as a generalization of the well-known star graph such as degree, connectivity, scalability, routing, diameter, and broadcasting. Next, we generalize MTS\n2,n to 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional matrix-star graphs MTS\nk, n\n, MTS\nk, n,p\n. One of important desirable properties of interconnection networks is network cost which is defined by degree times diameter. The star graph, which is one of popular interconnection topologies, has smaller network cost than other networks. Recently introduced network, the macro-star graph has smaller network cost than the star graph. We further improve network cost of the macro-star graph: Comparing a matrix-star graph \\(MTS_{k,k,k}(k = \\sqrt[3]{n^{2}})\\) with n\n2! nodes to a macro-star graph MS(n–1,n–1) with ((n–1)2+1)! nodes, network cost of MTS\nk,k, k\nis O(n\n2.7) and that of MS(n–1,n–1) is O(n\n3). It means that a matrix-star graph is better than a star graph and a macro-star graph in terms of network cost.","authors":["Hyeong-Ok Lee","Jongseok Kim","Kyoung-Wook Park","Jung-Hyun Seo"],"meta":["October 2005Lecture Notes in Computer Science","DOI:10.1007/11572961_38","SourceDBLP","Conference: Advances in Computer Systems Architecture, 10th Asia-Pacific Conference, ACSAC 2005, Singapore, October 24-26, 2005, Proceedings"],"references":["221085160_The_Star_Connected_Cycles_A_Fixed-Degree_Network_For_Parallel_Processing","3637910_Bubblesort_star_graphs_a_new_interconnection_network","3300308_Macro-star_networks_Efficient_low-degree_alternatives_to_star_graphs","3048416_Generalized_Hypercube_and_Hyperbus_Structures_for_a_Computer_Network","276169042_Graph_Theory_With_Applications","271512783_Graph_Theory_and_Applications","260585342_Transposition_networks_as_a_class_of_fault-tolerant_robust_networks","242608512_Introduction_to_Parallel_Algorithms_and_Architectures_Arrays_Trees_Hypercubes","221085880_The_Star_Graph_An_Attractive_Alternative_to_the_n-Cube","3300197_Honeycomb_networks_Topological_properties_and_communication_algorithms"]}
