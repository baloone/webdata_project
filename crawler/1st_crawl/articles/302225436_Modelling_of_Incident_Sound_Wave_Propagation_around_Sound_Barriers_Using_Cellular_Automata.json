{"id":"302225436_Modelling_of_Incident_Sound_Wave_Propagation_around_Sound_Barriers_Using_Cellular_Automata","abstract":"In the present study, acoustic wave propagation in the field including sound isolation panel is simulated using Cellular Automata (CA). CA is a discrete system which consists of finite state variables, arranged on a uniform grid. CA dynamics is described by a local interaction rule which is used for computation of new state of each cell from the present state at every time step. In this study a sound field is modeled using CA where the sound isolation panel exists and the numerical simulation results are evaluated quantitatively by the insertion loss. The results showed good correspondence with analytical solutions.","authors":["Toshihiko Komatsuzaki","Yoshio Iwata","Shin Morishita"],"meta":["September 2012","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-33350-7_40","Conference: International Conference on Cellular Automata"],"references":["266218434_Simple_Lattice_Gas_Models_for_Waves","216300438_Cellular_Automata_Modeling_of_Physical_Systems","344896449_Cellular_Automata_Modeling_of_Physical_Systems","245424264_Sound_propagation_simulations_using_lattice_gas_methods","243350509_Multiple-edge_noise_barriers","239436861_Noise_Reduction_Effect_of_Noise_Barrier_for_Shinkansen_Based_on_Y-shaped_Structure","230974653_A_cellular_automata_model_of_large-scale_moving_objects","225127039_Modeling_of_Sound_Absorption_by_Porous_Materials_Using_Cellular_Automata","223654519_Acoustic_performance_of_a_multiple_edge_noise_barrier_profile_at_motorway_sites","222740419_Noise_reduction_by_screens","222059289_Sound_diffraction_by_a_partially_inclined_noise_barrier"]}
