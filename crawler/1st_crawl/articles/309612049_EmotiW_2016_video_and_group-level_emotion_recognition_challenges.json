{"id":"309612049_EmotiW_2016_video_and_group-level_emotion_recognition_challenges","abstract":"This paper discusses the baseline for the Emotion Recognition in the Wild (EmotiW) 2016 challenge. Continuing on the theme of automatic affect recognition `in the wild', the EmotiW challenge 2016 consists of two sub-challenges: an audio-video based emotion and a new group-based emotion recognition sub-challenges. The audio-video based sub-challenge is based on the Acted Facial Expressions in the Wild (AFEW) database. The group-based emotion recognition sub-challenge is based on the Happy People Images (HAPPEI) database. We describe the data, baseline method, challenge protocols and the challenge results. A total of 22 and 7 teams participated in the audio-video based emotion and group-based emotion sub-challenges, respectively.","authors":["Abhinav Dhall","Roland Goecke","Jyoti Joshi","Jesse Hoey"],"meta":["October 2016","DOI:10.1145/2993148.2997638","Conference: the 18th ACM International Conference","Project: Emotion recognition in the wild"],"references":["309612135_Group_happiness_assessment_using_geometric_features_and_dataset_balancing","308453418_Video-based_emotion_recognition_using_CNN-RNN_and_C3D_hybrid_networks","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","310821718_LSTM_for_dynamic_emotion_and_group_emotion_recognition_in_the_wild","310821405_Multi-clue_fusion_for_emotion_recognition_in_the_wild","310793834_Mood_meter_Counting_smiles_in_the_wild","309614650_Happiness_level_prediction_with_sequential_inputs_via_multiple_regressions","309612148_HoloNet_towards_robust_emotion_recognition_in_the_wild","309612050_Emotion_recognition_in_the_wild_from_videos_using_images","289569787_Survey_on_RGB_3D_Thermal_and_Multimodal_Approaches_for_Facial_Expression_Recognition_History_Trends_and_Affect-Related_Applications"]}
