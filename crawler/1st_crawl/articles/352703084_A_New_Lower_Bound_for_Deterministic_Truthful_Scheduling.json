{"id":"352703084_A_New_Lower_Bound_for_Deterministic_Truthful_Scheduling","abstract":"We study the problem of truthfully scheduling m tasks to n selfish unrelated machines, under the objective of makespan minimization, as was introduced in the seminal work of Nisan and Ronen (in: The 31st Annual ACM symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC), 1999). Closing the current gap of [2.618, n] on the approximation ratio of deterministic truthful mechanisms is a notorious open problem in the field of algorithmic mechanism design. We provide the first such improvement in more than a decade, since the lower bounds of 2.414 (for \\(n=3\\)) and 2.618 (for \\(n\\rightarrow \\infty\\)) by Christodoulou et al. (in: Proceedings of the 18th Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA), 2007) and Koutsoupias and Vidali (in: Proceedings of Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science (MFCS), 2007), respectively. More specifically, we show that the currently best lower bound of 2.618 can be achieved even for just \\(n=4\\) machines; for \\(n=5\\) we already get the first improvement, namely 2.711; and allowing the number of machines to grow arbitrarily large we can get a lower bound of 2.755.","authors":["Yiannis Giannakopoulos","Alexander Hammerl","Diogo Po√ßas"],"meta":["September 2021Algorithmica 83(2)","DOI:10.1007/s00453-021-00847-2"],"references":["344263851_A_New_Lower_Bound_for_Deterministic_Truthful_Scheduling","321095409_New_bounds_for_scheduling_on_two_unrelated_selfish_machines","262604241_Bayesian_Truthful_Mechanisms_for_Job_Scheduling_from_Bi-criterion_Approximation_Algorithms","352881262_On_the_Nisan-Ronen_conjecture_for_submodular_valuations","346784376_Copula-based_Randomized_Mechanisms_for_Truthful_Scheduling_on_Two_Unrelated_Machines","337419243_The_Pareto_Frontier_of_Inefficiency_in_Mechanism_Design","330611499_The_anarchy_of_scheduling_without_money","321839704_The_VCG_Mechanism_for_Bayesian_Scheduling","321521130_Approximation_Algorithms","268552348_Introduction_to_mechanism_design_for_computer_scientists","261069330_Hybrid_Algorithms_for_NP-Hard_Problems","259513737_Truthful_optimization_using_mechanisms_with_verification","237398864_Setting_Lower_Bounds_on_Truthfulness","236621681_Prior-Independent_Mechanisms_for_Scheduling","230595785_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Scheduling"]}
