{"id":"277723227_Geometrical_Applications_of_Split_Octonions","abstract":"Physical signals and space-time intervals are described in terms of split\noctonions. Geometrical symmetries are represented by the automorphism group of\nthe algebra - the real non-compact form of Cartan's smallest exceptional group\nG2. This group generates specific rotations of (3+4)-vector parts of split\noctonions with three extra time-like coordinates and in certain limits reduces\nto standard Lorentz group. In this picture several physical characteristics of\nordinary (3+1)-dimensional theory (such as: number of spatial dimensions,\nexistence of maximal velocities, the uncertainty principle, some quantum\nnumbers) are naturally emerge from the properties of the algebra.","authors":["Merab Gogberashvili","Otari Sakhelashvili"],"meta":["October 2015Advances in Mathematical Physics 2015(11)","DOI:10.1155/2015/196708","SourcearXiv"],"references":["311746128_Translations_between_Quaternion_and_Complex_Quantum_Mechanics","270515071_Cosmological_constant_supersymmetry_nonassociativity_and_Big_Numbers","266971878_Split_Quaternions_and_Particles_in_21-Space","279342005_Particle_masses_force_constants_and_Spin8","268928899_Les_groupes_reels_simples_finis_et_continus","268639687_Octonions_Jordan_algebras_and_exceptional_groups_Revised_English_version_of_the_original_German_notes","268309246_On_the_Role_of_Division_Jordan_and_Related_Algebras_in_Particle_Physics","268064213_Spin8_Gauge_Field_Theory","266213245_Sur_la_Structure_des_Groupes_de_Transformation_Finis_et_Continus","265561395_Clifford_Algebras_and_Spinors"]}
