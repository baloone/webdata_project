This method is based on a new parameter calculated from the stepwise rotation of images and thereby, calculating the values independent of the original texture orientation. The proposed method was applied on a database of etched and scanning electron microscopy (SEM)-imaged low-carbon steel microstructures that are currently extensively used for automated microstructure classification. The results on the microstructures consisting of pearlitic, lath martensitic and lower bainitic constituents revealed that the method allows a significant separation of various types of microstructures in the ideal case of square-shaped cutouts. For complete grains of the corresponding second phases, the results imply that the application of a classifier is advantageous to distinguish them with a sufficient accuracy. The robustness and workability of the method was further demonstrated by discussing the effect of varying the image resolution and contrast/brightness settings during image acquisition. It was shown that such user-dependent setting parameters do not impair the separability of the steel constituents by using the proposed method.","authors":["Johannes Webel","Jessica Gola","Dominik Britz","Frank MÃ¼cklich"],"meta":["August 2018Materials Characterization 144","DOI:10.1016/j.matchar.2018.08.009"],"references":["329126374_Biomedical_Image_Analysis","200653366_Electron_backscattering_diffraction_study_of_acicular_ferrite_bainite_and_martensite_steel_microstructures"]}
