{"id":"200018952_Differential_Algebra","abstract":"The purpose of this difficult chapter is to mix together the homological methods, introduced in Chapter II for studying the\nproperties of modules, with the homological methods, introduced in Chapter III for studying the properties of systems. The combination, namely the module theoretic approach towards a better and deeper understanding of the formal theory of\nsystems of partial differential equations, is now known under the name “algebraic analysis”, thanks to the pioneering work of Palamodov [154, 155] and Kashiwara [111]. On one side, we should like to stress the beauty\nof this theory which allows to exhibit properties of systems that could neither be imagined nor even be deduced otherwise.\nOn the other side, we should like to stress that these new methods are almost never illustrated in the literature and have,\nto our knowledge, never been used for application (mathematical physics, engineering sciences,…), probably because of their\ninherent difficulty. We shall insist on the main point, which is at the same time one of the most delicate and one of the\nmost useful in actual practice, namely the importance of the “side changing functor” allowing to pass from right differential modules to operators and thus to be able to describe extensions modules in terms\nof operators instead of their usual abstract setting.","authors":["J.
