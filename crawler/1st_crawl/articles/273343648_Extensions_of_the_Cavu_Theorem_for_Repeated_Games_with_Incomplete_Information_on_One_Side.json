{"id":"273343648_Extensions_of_the_Cavu_Theorem_for_Repeated_Games_with_Incomplete_Information_on_One_Side","abstract":"This work is devoted to extend several asymptotic results concerning repeated games with incomplete information on one side. The model we consider is a generalization of the classical model of Aumann and Maschler (Aumann et al. [Aumann RJ, Maschler M, Stearns RE (1995) Repeated Games with Incomplete Information (MIT Press, Cambridge, MA)]) to infinite action spaces and partial information. We prove an extension of the classical ?Cav(u)? Theorem in this model for both the lower and upper value functions using two different methods: respectively a probabilistic method based on martingales and a functional one based on approximation schemes for viscosity solutions of Hamilton Jacobi equations similar to the dual differential approach of Laraki [Laraki R (2002) Repeated games with lack of information on one side: The dual differential approach. Math. Oper. Res. 27(2):419?440]. Moreover, we show that solutions of these two asymptotic problems provide asymptotically optimal strategies for both players in any","authors":["Fabien Gensbittel"],"meta":["July 2014Mathematics of Operations Research 40(1):80-104","DOI:10.1287/moor.2014.0658"],"references":["262352754_Repeated_Games_with_Lack_of_Information_on_One_Side_The_Dual_Differential_Approach","262162304_'Cav_u'_and_the_Dual_Game","221665842_Games_with_Incomplete_Information_in_Continuous_Time_and_for_Continuous_Types","46479407_Evaluating_Information_in_Zero-Sum_Games_with_Incomplete_Information_on_Both_Sides","2238265_Hopf-Lax_Formulas_for_Semicontinuous_Data","2207889_On_a_Continuous-Time_Game_with_Incomplete_Information","2137300_User's_Guide_to_Viscosity_Solutions_of_Second_Order_Artial_Differential_Equations","2136357_Stochastic_Differential_Games_with_Asymmetric_Information","267166530_Covariance_Control_Problems_over_Martingales_with_Fixed_Terminal_Distribution_Arising_from_Game_Theory","254419145_A_Continuous_Time_Approach_for_the_Asymptotic_Value_in_Two-Person_Zero-Sum_Repeated_Games","247007945_On_Hopf's_formulas_for_solutions_of_Hamilton-Jacobi_equations","243061715_An_Extension_of_Skorohod's_Almost_Sure_Representation_Theorem","242930046_Repeated_Games_Duality_and_the_Central_Limit_Theorem","242930045_Repeated_Games_and_Partial_Differential_Equations","240348860_Tightness_Criteria_for_Laws_of_Semimartingales","239062321_Approximation_schemes_for_viscosity_solutions_of_Hamilton-Jacobi_equations","226536741_Optimal_strategies_in_repeated_games_with_incomplete_information","222516840_Price_Dynamics_on_a_Stock_Market_with_Asymmetric_Information","38367396_Equivalent_Comparison_of_Experiments"]}
