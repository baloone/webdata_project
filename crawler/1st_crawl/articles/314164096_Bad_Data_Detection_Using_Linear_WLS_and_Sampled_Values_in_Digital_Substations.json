{"id":"314164096_Bad_Data_Detection_Using_Linear_WLS_and_Sampled_Values_in_Digital_Substations","abstract":"Smart Grids employ intelligent control applications which require high quality data: fast, secure, and error free. Several researchers have focused on providing techniques for low latency and secured data links for these applications. Bad data detection is however generally provided only at the central level due to limitations in legacy technologies employed in many substations. With the introduction of IEC61850 data sharing within the substation becomes more flexible and transparent allowing more sophisticated management of data quality. Hence, this paper proposes a substation level bad data detection algorithm to facilitate also these types of requirements from applications. The algorithm is based on automatically detecting the substation topology by parsing standard substation description files and online state of circuit breakers and disconnectors. By applying linear Weighted Least Square (WLS) based state estimation algorithm, bad data from failing Current Transformers can be detected. By conducting the verification of different types of bad data, the results show the output of bad data detection algorithm provides higher accuracy than output from both measurement and protective Current Transformers (CT) in both static and faulty situations.","authors":["Yiming Wu","Yong Xiao","Fabian Hohn","Lars Nordstrom"],"meta":["March 2017IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TPWRD.2017.2669110"],"references":["273161590_The_Impact_of_Current-Transformer_Saturation_on_TransformerDifferential_Protection","262528246_Adaptive_Quickest_Estimation_Algorithm_for_Smart_Grid_Network_Topology_Error","262150766_The_Effect_of_Variable_Weights_in_a_WLS_State_Estimator_Considering_Instrument_Transformer_Uncertainties","4333297_CT_Failure_Detection_For_Differential_Protection_Applications","3463835_Bad_Data_Identification_Methods_In_Power_System_State_Estimation-A_Comparative_Study","3266329_State_Estimation_Distribution_Processing","3265032_Parallel_and_distributed_state_estimation","304416498_Effects_of_bursty_event_traffic_on_synchrophasor_delays_in_IEEE_C37118_IEC61850_and_IEC60870","301248726_Adaptive_data_link_configuration_for_WAMC_applications_using_a_Stateful_Data_Delivery_Service_platform","283182259_Convexification_of_bad_data_and_topology_error_detection_and_identification_problems_in_AC_electric_power_systems","275110259_Discrimination_of_internal_fault_from_magnetising_inrush_current_in_power_transformers_based_on_sine-wave_least-squares_curve_fitting_method","261044796_The_supercalibrator_-_A_fully_distributed_state_estimator","259296629_Power_System_State_Estimation_Theory_and_Implementation","245507825_Bad_Data_Detection_of_Unequal_Magnitudes_in_State_Estimation_of_Power_Systems_Power_Engineering_Letters","239766303_ECT_Evaluation_by_an_Error_Measurement_System_According_to_IEC_60044-8_and_61850-9-2","224316308_GridStat_A_Flexible_QoS-Managed_Data_Dissemination_Framework_for_the_Power_Grid","224160063_Effects_of_sensor_technology_on_differential_protection","224141124_Transition_to_a_Two-Level_Linear_State_Estimator-Part_I_Architecture","224123156_NASPInet_Specification_-_An_Important_Step_toward_Its_Implementation","44349781_State_Estimation_in_Electric_Power_Systems_A_Generalized_Approach","3460544_Bad_Data_Suppression_in_Power_System_Static_State_Estimation","3360551_New_bad-data_detection_and_identification_technique_based_on_rotation_of_measurement_order_for_sequential_state_estimation_for_power_systems","3272134_The_Tennessee_Valley_Authority's_TVA's_experience_and_action_plans_with_freestanding_oil-filled_current_transformers_CTs","3267332_Multiarea_State_Estimation_Using_Synchronized_Phasor_Measurements","3266466_Closure_to_State_estimation_distributed_processing","3264043_A_Recursive_Measurement_Error_Estimation_Identification_Method_for_Bad_Data_Analysis_in_Power_System_State_Estimation"]}
