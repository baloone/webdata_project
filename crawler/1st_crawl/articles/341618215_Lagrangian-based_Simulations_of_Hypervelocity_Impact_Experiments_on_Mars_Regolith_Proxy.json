{"id":"341618215_Lagrangian-based_Simulations_of_Hypervelocity_Impact_Experiments_on_Mars_Regolith_Proxy","abstract":"Most of the surface of Mars is covered with unconsolidated rocky material, known as regolith. High‐fidelity models of the dynamics of impacts in such material are needed to help with the interpretation of seismic signals that are now recorded by SEIS, the seismometer of InSight. We developed a numerical model for impacts on regolith, using the novel Hybrid Optimization Software Suite (HOSS), which is a Lagrangian code mixing finite and discrete element formulations. We use data from hypervelocity impact experiments performed on pumice sand at the NASA Ames Vertical Gun Range to identify and calibrate key model parameters. The model provides insight into the plastic‐elastic transition observed in the data and it also demonstrates that gravity plays a key role in the material response. Waveforms for receivers situated vertically below the impact point are correctly modeled, while more research is needed to explain the shallow receivers' signals.","authors":["M.
