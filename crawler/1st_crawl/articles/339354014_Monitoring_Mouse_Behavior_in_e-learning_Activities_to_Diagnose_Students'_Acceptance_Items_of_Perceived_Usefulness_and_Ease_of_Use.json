{"id":"339354014_Monitoring_Mouse_Behavior_in_e-learning_Activities_to_Diagnose_Students'_Acceptance_Items_of_Perceived_Usefulness_and_Ease_of_Use","abstract":"This study investigates students' mouse behavior during their interaction with a web-based experiential learning environment for Computer Science courses. The research focuses on the detection of correlations between the monitored mouse metrics and students' technology acceptance items of perceived usefulness and ease of use. Findings reveal several significant correlations; in particular, metrics of mouse clicks and hovers can be associated with students' perceived ease use and perceived usefulness. The findings of this work show an interesting research direction towards the analysis of learners' mouse behavior during their interaction with interactive and web-based tutoring systems.","authors":["Katerina Tzafilkou","Nicolaos Protogeros"],"meta":["February 2020The European Educational Researcher 3(1)","DOI:10.31757/euer.312"],"references":["301428394_Understanding_Within-Content_Engagement_through_Pattern_Analysis_of_Mouse_Gestures","284283645_Engaging_end-users_in_creating_data-intensive_mobile_applications_A_creative_'e-learning-by-doing'_approach","277934491_Experiential_Learning_Empowering_Students_to_Take_Control_of_Their_Learning_by_Engaging_Them_in_an_Interactive_Course_Simulation_Environment","277664694_Mouse_Tracking_for_Web_Marketing_Enhancing_User_Experience_in_Web_Application_Software_by_Measuring_Self-Efficacy_and_Hesitation_Levels","323167479_Mouse_Behavioral_Patterns_and_Keystroke_Dynamics_in_End-User_Development_what_can_they_tell_us_about_users'_behavioral_attributes","313581778_Diagnosing_User_Perception_and_Acceptance_using_Eye_Tracking_in_Web-based_End-User_Development","312984568_Perceived_usefulness_perceived_ease_and_user_acceptance_of_information_technology","312752328_Dynamic_User_Authentication_Based_on_Mouse_Movements_Curves","309456367_An_Analysis_of_Variance_Test_for_Normality_Complete_Samples","308136726_Combining_eye_tracking_pupil_dilation_and_EEG_analysis_for_predicting_web_users_click_intention"]}
