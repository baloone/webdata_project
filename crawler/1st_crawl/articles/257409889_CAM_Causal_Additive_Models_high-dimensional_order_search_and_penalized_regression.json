{"id":"257409889_CAM_Causal_Additive_Models_high-dimensional_order_search_and_penalized_regression","abstract":"We develop estimation for potentially high-dimensional additive structural\nequation models. A key component of our approach is to decouple order search\namong the variables from feature or edge selection in a directed acyclic graph\nencoding the causal structure. We show that the former can be done with\nnon-regularized (restricted) maximum likelihood estimation while the latter can\nbe efficiently addressed using sparse regression techniques. Thus, we\nsubstantially simplify the problem of structure search and estimation for an\nimportant class of causal models. We establish consistency of the (restricted)\nmaximum likelihood estimator for low- and high-dimensional scenarios, and we\nalso allow for misspecification of the error distribution. Furthermore, we\ndevelop an efficient computational algorithm which can deal with many\nvariables, and the new method's accuracy and performance is illustrated on\nsimulated and real data.","authors":["Peter BÃ¼hlmann","Jonas Peters","Jan Ernest"],"meta":["October 2013The Annals of Statistics 42(6)","DOI:10.1214/14-AOS1260","SourcearXiv"],"references":["258849775_Score-based_Causal_Learning_in_Additive_Noise_Models","257069435_Causal_Discovery_with_Continuous_Additive_Noise_Models","254883062_On_causal_discovery_with_cyclic_additive_noise_models","329654602_Causation_Prediction_and_Search","304824205_Regression_Shrinkage_and_Selection_via_the_LASSO","275697437_Causality_Models_Reasoning_and_Inference","265352649_Causality_Models_reasoning_and_inference_second_edition","258082781_On_the_uniform_convergence_of_empirical_norms_and_inner_products_with_application_to_causal_inference","254211569_The_adaptive_and_the_thresholded_Lasso_for_potentially_misspecified_models_and_a_lower_bound_for_the_Lasso","246057298_Empirical_Process_in_M-Estimation"]}
