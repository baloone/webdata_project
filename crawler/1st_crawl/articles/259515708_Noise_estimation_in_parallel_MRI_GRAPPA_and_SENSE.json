{"id":"259515708_Noise_estimation_in_parallel_MRI_GRAPPA_and_SENSE","abstract":"Parallel imaging methods allow to increase the acquisition rate via subsampled acquisitions of the k − space. SENSE and GRAPPA are the most popular reconstruction methods proposed in order to suppress the artifacts created by this subsampling. The reconstruction process carried out by both methods yields to a variance of noise value which is dependent on the position within the final image. Hence, the traditional noise estimation methods—based on a single noise level for the whole image—fail. In this paper we propose a novel methodology to estimate the spatial dependent pattern of the variance of noise in SENSE and GRAPPA reconstructed images. In both cases, some additional information must be known beforehand: the sensitivity maps of each receiver coil in the SENSE case and the reconstruction coefficients for GRAPPA.","authors":["Santiago Aja-Fernández","Gonzalo Vegas Sánchez-Ferrero","Antonio Tristán-Vega"],"meta":["January 2013Magnetic Resonance Imaging 32(3)","DOI:10.1016/j.mri.2013.12.001"],"references":["8178233_SMASH_SENSE_PILS_GRAPPA_how_to_choose_the_optimal_method","6504908_Automatic_Estimation_of_the_Noise_Variance_from_the_Histogram_of_a_Magnetic_Resonance_Image","2543206_Estimation_of_signal_and_noise_from_Rician_distributed_data","244904645_SMASH_SENSE_PILS_GRAPPA","232810652_Effective_noise_estimation_and_filtering_from_correlated_multiple-coil_MR_data","227725211_Signal-to-noisemeasurements_in_magnitude_images_from_NMR_based_arrays","227604108_A_tour_of_accelerated_parallel_MR_imaging_from_a_linear_systems_perspective","224204592_Rician_Distributed_FMRI_Asymptotic_Power_Analysis_and_Cramer-Rao_Lower_Bounds","222342959_Automatic_Noise_Estimation_in_Images_using_Local_Statistics_Additive_and_Multiplicative_Cases","51406938_Noise_and_signal_estimation_in_magnitude_MRI_and_RICIAN_distributed_images_a_LMMSE_approach","51204568_Influence_of_noise_correlation_in_multiple-coil_statistical_models_with_sum_of_squares_reconstruction","50410583_Statistical_Noise_Analysis_in_GRAPPA_Using_a_Parametrized_Noncentral_Chi_Approximation_Model","44586785_About_the_background_distribution_in_MR_data_A_local_variance_study","26655001_General_Formulation_for_Quantitative_G-factor_Calculation_in_GRAPPA_Reconstructions","26334259_Noise_estimation_in_single-_and_multiple-coil_magnetic_resonance_data_based_on_statistical_models","23678151_A_Bayesian_hierarchical_model_for_the_analysis_of_a_longitudinal_dynamic_contrast-enhanced_MRI_oncology_study","23281251_Comprehensive_Quantification_of_Signal-to-Noise_Ratio_and_g-Factor_for_Image-Based_and_k-Space-Based_Parallel_Imaging_Reconstructions","14786324_An_unbiased_signal_to_noise_measure_for_magnetic_resonance_images","14601371_The_Rician_distribution_of_noisy_MRI_Data","13872036_Signal-to-Noise_Measurements_in_Magnitude_Images_from_NMR_Phased_Arrays_of_the","13793485_Estimation_of_the_Noise_in_Magnitude_MR_Images","13549721_Design_and_construction_of_a_realistic_digital_brain_phantom","12759098_SENSE_sensitivity_encoding_for_fast_MRI","12346154_Description_of_parallel_imaging_in_MRI_using_multiple_coils","11266558_Generalized_Autocalibrating_Partially_Parallel_Acquisitions_GRAPPA","8376991_Analysis_of_noise_effects_on_DTI-based_tractography_using_the_brute-force_and_multi-ROI_approach","7287852_Analytically_exact_correction_scheme_for_signal_extraction_from_noisy_magnitude_MR_signals","6432335_Parallel_magnetic_resonance_imaging","6133072_Noise_distribution_in_SENSE-_and_GRAPPA-reconstructed_images_a_computer_simulation_study","5634141_Automatic_detection_of_brain_contours_in_MRI_data_sets","5411148_Influence_of_multichannel_combination_parallel_imaging_and_other_reconstruction_techniques_on_MRI_noise_characteristics"]}
