{"id":"329552108_A_Minimal_Set_of_Physiomarkers_in_High_Frequency_Real-Time_Physiological_Data_Streams_Predict_Adult_Sepsis_Onset_Earlier","abstract":"Purpose: \nSepsis is a life-threatening condition with high mortality rates and expensive treatment costs. To improve short- and long-term outcomes, it is critical to detect at-risk sepsis patients at an early stage.\n\nMethods: \nA data-set consisting of high-frequency physiological data from 1161 critically ill patients was analyzed. 377 patients had developed sepsis, and had data at least 3 h prior to the onset of sepsis. A random forest classifier was trained to discriminate between sepsis and non-sepsis patients in real-time using a total of 132 features extracted from a moving time-window. The model was trained on 80% of the patients and was tested on the remaining 20% of the patients, for two observational periods of lengths 3 and 6 h prior to onset.\n\nResults: \nThe model that used continuous physiological data alone resulted in sensitivity and F1 score of up to 80% and 67% one hour before sepsis onset. On average, these models were able to predict sepsis 294.19 Â± 6.50 min (5 h) before the onset.\n\nConclusions: \nThe use of machine learning algorithms on continuous streams of physiological data can allow for early identification of at-risk patients in real-time with high accuracy.","authors":["Franco van Wyk","Anahita Khojandi","Akram Mohammed","Edmon Begoli"],"meta":["December 2018International Journal of Medical Informatics 122","DOI:10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2018.12.002"],"references":["326661039_Applying_Artificial_Intelligence_to_Identify_Physiomarkers_Predicting_Severe_Sepsis_in_the_PICU","322704977_Raising_concerns_about_the_Sepsis-3_definitions","322703262_A_robust_deep_convolutional_neural_network_for_the_classification_of_abnormal_cardiac_rhythm_using_varying_length_single_lead_electrocardiogram","322219344_How_much_data_should_we_collect_A_case_study_in_sepsis_detection_using_deep_learning","321037145_Deep_neural_architectures_for_prediction_in_healthcare","313857891_A_Survey_on_Deep_Learning_in_Medical_Image_Analysis","305645179_Reduction_of_false_arrhythmia_alarms_using_signal_selection_and_machine_learning","303747025_A_Multilayer_Perceptron_Based_Smart_Pathological_Brain_Detection_System_by_Fractional_Fourier_Entropy","303657108_TensorFlow_A_system_for_large-scale_machine_learning","280911361_A_targeted_real-time_early_warning_score_TREWScore_for_septic_shock","277412717_Precision_Medicine_-_Personalized_Problematic_and_Promising","277411157_Deep_Learning","272830136_Big_data_analytics_in_healthcare_Promise_and_potential","233806812_Assessing_available_information_on_the_burden_of_sepsis_Global_estimates_of_incidence_prevalence_and_mortality","221312290_On_the_use_of_decision_trees_for_ICU_outcome_prediction_in_sepsis_patients_treated_with_statins","221178905_Data_Mining_in_Healthcare_Information_Systems_Case_Study_of_a_Veterans_Administration_Spinal_Cord_Injury_Population","51969319_Scikit-learn_Machine_Learning_in_Python","51532662_Predicting_disease_risk_from_highly_imbalanced_data_using_random_forest","26741825_Continuous_Multi-Parameter_Heart_Rate_Variability_Analysis_Heralds_Onset_of_Sepsis_in_Adults","3422935_Python_for_Scientific_Computing","322133343_An_Interpretable_Machine_Learning_Model_for_Accurate_Prediction_of_Sepsis_in_the_ICU","319199374_Learning_representations_for_the_early_detection_of_sepsis_with_deep_neural_networks","319140126_Early_Sepsis_Detection_in_Critical_Care_Patients_Using_Multiscale_Blood_Pressure_and_Heart_rate_Dynamics","314167090_Specific_Etiologies_Associated_With_the_Multiple_Organ_Dysfunction_Syndrome_in_Children_Part_1","312145950_Mitosis_detection_in_breast_cancer_pathology_images_by_combining_handcrafted_and_convolutional_neural_network_features","309885963_Big_Data_in_Healthcare","308872163_Clinical_Mimics_An_Emergency_Medicine-Focused_Review_of_Sepsis_Mimics","288906520_Random_forests","271592141_A_New_Initiative_on_Precision_Medicine","226270700_Bagging_Predictors","224261964_Heart_Disease_Classification_Using_Neural_Network_and_Feature_Selection","26016848_International_Classification_of_Diseases","10847119_Abnormal_Heart_Rate_Characteristics_Preceding_Neonatal_Sepsis_and_Sepsis-Like_Illness","5336859_Comparison_of_WBC_ESR_CRP_and_PCT_serum_levels_in_septic_and_non-septic_burn_cases","3697712_Random_decision_forests"]}
