{"id":"349145426_An_Introduction_To_Linear_Temporal_Logic_LTL","abstract":"In this article, we review Linear temporal logic and introduce the syntax, semantics and deduc-tive system for linear temporal logic. Then we prove the soundness and completeness according to the system we built and finally give an example of application in computer science. In logic, linear temporal logic or linear temporal logic is a justified temporal logic with justifications to time.Linear time logic itself is a part of the more complex CTL logic that allows time and metrics to be branched.","authors":["Saman Arzaghi"],"meta":["February 2021"],"references":["265374356_An_Introduction_to_Non-Classical_Logic","2531562_Logic_in_Computer_Science"]}
