It is currently feasible to generate omic-scale biological measurements for all patients in a study, providing an opportunity for machine learning models to identify molecular markers for disease diagnosis and progression. However, the high variability of genetic background in human populations hampers the reproducibility of omic-scale markers. In this paper, we develop a biological network-based regularized artificial neural network model for prediction of phenotype from transcriptomic measurements in clinical trials. To improve model sparsity and the overall reproducibility of the model, we incorporate regularization for simultaneous shrinkage of gene sets based on active upstream regulatory mechanisms into the model. ResultsWe benchmark our method against various regression, support vector machines and artificial neural network models and demonstrate the ability of our method in predicting the clinical outcomes using clinical trial data on acute rejection in kidney transplantation and response to Infliximab in ulcerative colitis. We show that integration of prior biological knowledge into the classification as developed in this paper, significantly improves the robustness and generalizability of predictions to independent datasets. We provide a Java code of our algorithm along with a parsed version of the STRING DB database. Conclusion\nIn summary, we present a method for prediction of clinical phenotypes using baseline genome-wide expression data that makes use of prior biological knowledge on gene-regulatory interactions in order to increase robustness and reproducibility of omic-scale markers. The integrated group-wise regularization methods increases the interpretability of biological signatures and gives stable performance estimates across independent test sets.","authors":["Tianyu Kang","Wei Ding","Luoyan Zhang","Daniel Ziemek"],"meta":["December 2017BMC Bioinformatics 18(1)","DOI:10.1186/s12859-017-1984-2"],"references":["320387316_Using_a_Machine_Learning_Approach_to_Predict_Outcomes_after_Radiosurgery_for_Cerebral_Arteriovenous_Malformations","309462441_tmod_an_R_package_for_general_and_multivariate_enrichment_analysis","308079026_Omics-Based_Strategies_in_Precision_Medicine_Toward_a_Paradigm_Shift_in_Inborn_Errors_of_Metabolism_Investigations","307568654_Interpreting_transcriptional_changes_using_causal_graphs_New_methods_and_their_practical_utility_on_public_networks","297723436_Pathway-Based_Genomics_Prediction_using_Generalized_Elastic_Net","296404657_CANCER_BIOMARKER_DISCOVERY_BY_ONCOPROTEOMICS","295271330_Schizophrenia_A_common_disease_caused_by_multiple_rare_alleles","288060786_Rare_and_common_variants_Twenty_arguments_Nat","286748723_A_map_of_human_genome_variation_from_population-scale_sequencing","285797736_Diagnosis_of_multiple_cancer_types_by_shrunken_centroids_of_gene_expression"]}
