{"id":"316747641_Vehicle_routing_with_roaming_delivery_locations","abstract":"We propose the vehicle routing problem with roaming delivery locations (VRPRDL) to model an innovation in last-mile delivery where a customer’s order is delivered to the trunk of his car. We develop construction and improvement heuristics for the VRPRDL based on two problem-specific techniques: (1) efficiently optimizing the delivery locations for a fixed customer delivery sequence and (2) efficiently switching a predecessor’s or successor’s delivery location during the insertion or deletion of a customer in a route. Furthermore, we conduct an extensive computation study to assess and quantify the benefits of trunk delivery in a variety of settings. The study reveals that a significant reduction in total distance travelled can be achieved, especially when trunk delivery is combined with traditional home delivery, which has both economic and environmental benefits.","authors":["Luis Damian Reyes Rodriguez","Martin Savelsbergh","Alejandro Toriello"],"meta":["July 2017Transportation Research Part C Emerging Technologies 80:71-91","DOI:10.1016/j.trc.2017.04.003"],"references":["242933344_Time_Dependent_Vehicle_Routing_Problems_Formulations_Properties_and_Heuristic_Algorithms","230846314_A_hybrid_genetic_algorithm_with_adaptive_diversity_management_for_a_large_class_of_vehicle_routing_problems_with_time-windows","228809633_Formulations_and_Branch-and-Cut_Algorithms_for_the_Generalized_Vehicle_Routing_Problem","228255796_An_Incremental_Tabu_Search_Heuristic_for_the_Generalized_Vehicle_Routing_Problem_with_Time_Windows","225237245_Greedy_Randomized_Adaptive_Search_Procedures","220413126_Efficient_Insertion_Heuristics_for_Vehicle_Routing_and_Scheduling_Problems","222572129_Vehicle_Dispatching_With_Time_-_Dependent_Travel_Times","222554425_A_general_heuristic_for_vehicle_routing_problems","221704738_Algorithms_for_the_Vehicle_Routing_and_Scheduling_Problems_With_Time_Window_Constraints","221704676_Local_search_in_routing_problems_with_time_windows","220413044_Fifty_Years_of_Vehicle_Routing","220288091_Recent_exact_algorithms_for_solving_the_vehicle_routing_problem_under_capacity_and_time_window_constraints","200621952_The_Truck_Dispatching_Problem"]}
