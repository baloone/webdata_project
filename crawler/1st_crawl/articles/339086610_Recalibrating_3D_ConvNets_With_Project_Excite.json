{"id":"339086610_Recalibrating_3D_ConvNets_With_Project_Excite","abstract":"Fully Convolutional Neural Networks (F-CNNs) achieve state-of-the-art performance for segmentation tasks in computer vision and medical imaging. Recently, computational blocks termed \nsqueeze and excitation \n(SE) have been introduced to recalibrate F-CNN feature maps both channel- and spatial-wise, boosting segmentation performance while only minimally increasing the model complexity. So far, the development of SE blocks has focused on 2D architectures. For volumetric medical images, however, 3D F-CNNs are a natural choice. In this article, we extend existing 2D recalibration methods to 3D and propose a generic \ncompress-process-recalibrate \npipeline for easy comparison of such blocks. We further introduce \nProject & Excite \n(PE) modules, customized for 3D networks. In contrast to existing modules, Project & Excite does not perform global average pooling but compresses feature maps along different spatial dimensions of the tensor separately to retain more spatial information that is subsequently used in the excitation step. We evaluate the modules on two challenging tasks, whole-brain segmentation of MRI scans and whole-body segmentation of CT scans. We demonstrate that PE modules can be easily integrated into 3D F-CNNs, boosting performance up to 0.3 in Dice Score and outperforming 3D extensions of other recalibration blocks, while only marginally increasing the model complexity.
