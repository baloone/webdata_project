{"id":"262216224_Interactive_Case_Based_Learning_in_Teaching_Decision_Support_Systems_and_Business_Intelligence","abstract":"An important learning outcome in teaching Decision Support Systems and Business Intelligence is understanding the decision making processes in real-life. Classroom discussion can be an effective tool for understanding how different factors affect the decision making but reality of the real-life business is so complex to be understood with simple discussions. In such a scenario, real-life case studies can be very helpful. The real-life case studies offer experiential learning that can improve the learning outcomes of the course. This paper aims at describing how interactive action oriented case studies, with student participation, aid in the process of learning in the Decision Support Systems and Business Intelligence course for undergraduate students, and make it more dynamic and interesting.","authors":["Salma Mahgoub","Farrukh Nadeem"],"meta":["October 2012","DOI:10.1145/2379636.2379669","Conference: Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Interacci√≥n Persona-Ordenador"],"references":["257302066_Case_Based_Learning_A_Method_for_Better_Understanding_of_Biochemistry_in_Medical_Students","302414542_Fostering_transformative_learning_in_leadership_development","268599681_Case_Studies_for_Environmental_and_Water_Resources_Systems_Analysis_Education","267995804_Developments_in_Business_Simulations_and_Experiential_Learning_EXPLORING_THE_PREFERENCE_IN_LEARNING_APPROACH_AMONG_THE_HONG_KONG_UNIVERSITY_STUDENTS_CASE_STUDY_PROBLEM-BASED_OR_TRADITIONAL_TEXTBOOK_QU","252059351_StudentCentered_Learning_Addressing_Faculty_Questions_about_Student_centered_Learning","247848012_The_Early_History_of_Case-Based_Instruction_Insights_for_Teacher_Education_Today","242591607_Case_Teaching","234624476_Organizing_Instruction_and_Study_to_Improve_Student_Learning_IES_Practice_Guide_NCER_2007-2004","234610194_A_Handbook_for_Classroom_Instruction_That_Works","228815600_Multimedia-based_case_studies_in_education_Design_development_and_evaluation_of_multimedia-based_case_studies","225516134_Implementation_and_evaluation_of_a_student-centered_learning_unit_A_case_studyEducational_Technology_Research_and_Development_483_79-100","222836727_Effects_of_Problem-Based_Learning_A_Meta-Analysis","220041676_Contemporary_Paradigms_of_Learning","200086112_A_Technique_for_Measurement_of_Attitudes"]}
