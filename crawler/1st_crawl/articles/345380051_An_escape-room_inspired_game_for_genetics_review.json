{"id":"345380051_An_escape-room_inspired_game_for_genetics_review","abstract":"Active learning strategies engage students in instruction by making them an integral part of the teaching process. Gamification is one type of active learning approach that incentivises student participation by incorporating gaming elements into the learning experience. Although gamification might be an effective strategy for the introduction of new material, adding gaming elements to a review activity can motivate students to study, help them organise material, and identify material that they should review further before an exam. Escape rooms are collaborative problem-solving challenges and aspects of escape-room experiences can be applied to active learning. Here, we describe an escape room inspired review game for an advanced genetic analysis class at Northwestern University. We provide a detailed account of each puzzle within the review game and assess the impact of the game on learning outcomes.","authors":["Shannon C. Brady","Erik C.
