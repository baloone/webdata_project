{"id":"318923053_The_comparison_of_the_use_of_holonic_and_agent-based_methods_in_modelling_of_manufacturing_systems","abstract":"The rapid evolution in the field of industrial automation and manufacturing is often called the 4th Industry Revolution. Worldwide availability of the internet access contributes to the competition between manufacturers, gives the opportunity for buying materials, parts and for creating the partnership networks, like cloud manufacturing, grid manufacturing (MGrid), virtual enterprises etc. The effect of the industry evolution is the need to search for new solutions in the field of manufacturing systems modelling and simulation. During the last decade researchers have developed the agent-based approach of modelling. This methodology have been taken from the computer science, but was adapted to the philosophy of industrial automation and robotization. The operation of the agent-based system depends on the simultaneous acting of different agents that may have different roles. On the other hand, there is the holon-based approach that uses the structures created by holons. It differs from the agent-based structure in some aspects, while the other ones are quite similar in both methodologies. The aim of this paper is to present the both methodologies and discuss the similarities and the differences. This may could help to select the optimal method of modelling, according to the considered problem and software resources.","authors":["K Foit","Waclaw Banas","Aleksander Gwiazda","P Hryniewicz"],"meta":["August 2017IOP Conference Series Materials Science and Engineering 227(1):012046","DOI:10.1088/1757-899X/227/1/012046"],"references":["307876130_Determining_of_a_robot_workspace_using_the_integration_of_a_CAD_system_with_a_virtual_control_system","231964559_A_Survey_of_Multi-agent_Organizational_Paradigms","226808580_Holons_and_agents","224166089_Rockwell_Automation's_Holonic_and_Multiagent_Control_Systems_Compendium","321594677_ANEMONA_A_Mulit-agent_Methodology_for_Holonic_Manufacturing_Systems","303529090_Combined_strength_of_holons_agents_and_function_blocks_in_cyber-physical_systems","283778637_Industrial_Agents","245231303_Nonhierarchical_control_of_manufacturing_systems","243698150_Intelligence_and_Cooperation_in_Heterarchic_Manufacturing_Systems","228889087_An_agent-oriented_architecture_for_holonic_manufacturing_control"]}
