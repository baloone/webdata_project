{"id":"332488444_Human_Activity_Recognition_Based_on_Wearable_Sensor_Using_Hierarchical_Deep_LSTM_Networks","abstract":"In recent years, with the rapid development of artificial intelligence, human activity recognition has become a research focus. The complex, dynamic and variable features of human activities lead to the relatively low accuracy of the traditional recognition algorithms. In order to solve the problem, this paper will propose a novel structure named hierarchical deep LSTM (H-LSTM) based on long short-term memory. Firstly, the original sensor data are preprocessed by smoothing and denoising; then, the feature will be selected and extracted by timeâ€“frequency-domain method. Secondly, H-LSTM is applied to the classification of these activities. Three public UCI datasets are used to conduct simulation with the realization of the automatic extraction of feature vectors and classification of outputting recognition results. Finally, the simulation results testify to the outperformance of the H-LSTM network over other deep learning algorithms. The accuracy of H-LSTM network in human activity recognition is proved to be 99.15%.","authors":["LuKun Wang","RuYue Liu"],"meta":["February 2020Circuits Systems and Signal Processing 39(11)","DOI:10.1007/s00034-019-01116-y"],"references":["331145653_Risk_Assessment_of_Hypertension_in_Steel_Workers_Based_on_LVQ_and_Fisher-SVM_Deep_Excavation","330368005_Image_Inpainting_Based_on_Fractional-Order_Nonlinear_Diffusion_for_Image_Reconstruction","329205341_Research_on_prediction_model_of_geotechnical_parameters_based_on_BP_neural_network","328777626_Three-dimensional_convolutional_restricted_Boltzmann_machine_for_human_behavior_recognition_from_RGB-D_video","325347861_Real_Time_Human_Activity_Recognition_on_Smartphones_using_LSTM_Networks","325175696_Intelligent_Method_for_Identifying_Driving_Risk_Based_on_V2V_Multisource_Big_Data","324635700_Human_Weapon-Activity_Recognition_in_Surveillance_Videos_Using_Structural-RNN","323885414_Locomotion_Activity_Recognition_Using_Stacked_Denoising_Autoencoders","325493950_IoT_based_mobile_healthcare_system_for_human_activity_recognition","325025722_Deep_neural_networks_for_activity_recognition_with_multi-sensor_data_in_a_smart_home","323712565_Automated_daily_human_activity_recognition_for_video_surveillance_using_neural_network","320922327_PAMS_A_new_position-aware_multi-sensor_dataset_for_human_activity_recognition_using_smartphones","322283273_SEARE_A_System_for_Exercise_Activity_Recognition_and_Quality_Evaluation_Based_on_Green_Sensing","321892311_LSTM-RNNs_combined_with_scene_information_for_human_activity_recognition","320578702_Self-Gated_Recurrent_Neural_Networks_for_Human_Activity_Recognition_on_Wearable_Devices"]}
