{"id":"342762316_The_theta_wheel-free_graphs_Part_IV_Induced_paths_and_cycles","abstract":"A hole in a graph is a chordless cycle of length at least 4. A theta is a graph formed by three internally vertex-disjoint paths of length at least 2 between the same pair of distinct vertices. A wheel is a graph formed by a hole and a node that has at least 3 neighbors in the hole. In this series of papers we study the class of graphs that do not contain as an induced subgraph a theta nor a wheel. In Part II of the series we prove a decomposition theorem for this class, that uses clique cutsets and 2-joins. In this paper we use this decomposition theorem to solve several problems related to finding induced paths and cycles in our class.","authors":["Marko RadovanoviÄ‡","Nicolas Trotignon","Kristina Vuskovic"],"meta":["July 2020Journal of Combinatorial Theory Series B 146(3)","DOI:10.1016/j.jctb.2020.06.002"],"references":["322722286_The_theta_wheel-free_graphs_Part_I_Only-prism_and_only-pyramid_graphs","318418488_The_theta_wheel-free_graphs_Part_III_Cliques_stable_sets_and_coloring","266169941_Detecting_Fixed_Patterns_in_Chordal_Graphs_in_Polynomial_Time","315668320_The_theta_wheel-free_graphs_Part_II_Structure_theorem","303917281_Induced_Disjoint_Paths_in_Circular-Arc_Graphs_in_Linear_Time","303571244_Detecting_2-joins_faster","267466546_A_maxmn_algorithm_for_determining_the_graph_H_from_its_line_graph_G","265435677_Graph_minors_XIII_The_disjoint_paths_problem","239537898_On_the_Computational_Complexity_of_Combinatorial_Problems","234815615_The_-in-a-tree_problem_for_graphs_of_girth_at_least","227193226_The_complexity_of_induced_minors_and_related_problems","223118002_Decomposition_by_clique_separators","222422356_Detecting_induced_subgraphs","222252429_On_complexity_of_testing_for_odd_holes_and_induced_odd_paths","221665441_Induced_Disjoint_Paths_in_Claw-Free_Graphs","220574288_A_linear_time_algorithm_for_the_induced_disjoint_paths_problem_in_planar_graphs","220442019_The_three-in-a-tree_problem","220430847_An_Optimal_Algorithm_to_Detect_a_Line_Graph_and_Output_Its_Root_Graph","220078418_Combinatorial_optimization_with_2-joins","220075584_Clique_or_hole_in_claw-free_graphs","51917847_Detecting_2-joins_faster","41218557_The_k-in-a-Path_Problem_for_Claw-free_Graphs"]}
