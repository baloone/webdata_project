{"id":"245153728_Improving_the_Speed_of_Multi-way_Algorithms_Part_I_Tucker3","abstract":"In an attempt to improve the speed of multi-way algorithms, this paper investigates several different implementations of the Tucker3 algorithm. The interest is specifically aimed at developing a fast algorithm in the MATLABâ„¢ environment that is suitable for large data arrays. Nine different implementations are developed and tested on real and simulated data. In a subsequent paper, it will be demonstrated that a fast algorithm for the Tucker3 model provides a perfect basis for improving the speed of other multi-way algorithms. From the Internet address http:\\\\newton.mli.kvl.dk\\foodtech.html, the developed algorithms can be downloaded.","authors":["Claus A.
