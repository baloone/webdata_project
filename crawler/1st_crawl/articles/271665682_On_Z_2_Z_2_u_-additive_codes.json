{"id":"271665682_On_Z_2_Z_2_u_-additive_codes","abstract":"In this paper, a new class of additive codes which is referred to as ℤ2 ℤ2[u]-additive codes is introduced. This is a generalization towards another direction of recently introduced ℤ2 ℤ4-additive codes [J. Borges, C. Fernández-Córdoba, J. Pujol, J. Rif´a, and M. Villanueva, ℤ2 ℤ4-linear codes: Generator matrices and duality, Designs Codes Cryptogr. 54(2) (2010), pp. 167-179]. ℤ2 ℤ4-additive codes have shown to provide a promising class of codes with their algebraic structure and applications such as steganography. The standard generator matrices are established and by introducing orthogonality the parity-check matrices are also obtained. A MacWilliams-type identity that relates the weight enumerator of a code with its dual is proved. Furthermore, a Gray map that maps these codes to binary codes is defined and some examples of optimal codes which are the binary Gray images of ℤ2 ℤ2[u]-additive codes are presented.","authors":["Ismail Aydogdu","Taher Abualrub","Irfan Siap"],"meta":["December 2014International Journal of Computer Mathematics 92(9):1-19","DOI:10.1080/00207160.2013.859854"],"references":["275617426_The_Structure_of_Z2Z2s-Additive_Codes_Bounds_on_the_Minimum_Distance","260780408_Z2Z4-linear_codes_generator_matrices_and_duality","257554670_Z2Z4_-linear_codes_Generator_matrices_and_duality","220961190_Product_perfect_Z2Z4-linear_codes_in_steganography","220481561_Perfect_Z2Z4-linear_codes_in_Steganography","3079417_Bounds_on_Mixed_BinaryTernary_Codes","3078458_The_Z4-linearity_of_Kerdock_Preparata_Goethals_and_related_codes","266535101_An_identity_between_the_m-spotty_weight_enumerators_of_a_linear_code_and_its_dual","258239683_The_theory_of_error-correcting_codes_Parts_I_II","242371333_The_Theory_of_Error_Correcting_Codes"]}
