{"id":"332926328_Super-resolution_reconstruction_of_turbulent_flows_with_machine_learning","abstract":"We use machine learning to perform super-resolution analysis of grossly under-resolved turbulent flow field data to reconstruct the high-resolution flow field. Two machine learning models are developed, namely, the convolutional neural network (CNN) and the hybrid downsampled skip-connection/multi-scale (DSC/MS) models. These machine learning models are applied to a two-dimensional cylinder wake as a preliminary test and show remarkable ability to reconstruct laminar flow from low-resolution flow field data. We further assess the performance of these models for two-dimensional homogeneous turbulence. The CNN and DSC/MS models are found to reconstruct turbulent flows from extremely coarse flow field images with remarkable accuracy. For the turbulent flow problem, the machine-leaning-based super-resolution analysis can greatly enhance the spatial resolution with as little as 50 training snapshot data, holding great potential to reveal subgrid-scale physics of complex turbulent flows. With the growing availability of flow field data from high-fidelity simulations and experiments, the present approach motivates the development of effective super-resolution models for a variety of fluid flows.","authors":["Kai Fukami","Koji Fukagata","Kunihiko Taira"],"meta":["July 2019Journal of Fluid Mechanics 870:106-120","DOI:10.1017/jfm.2019.238"],"references":["330210433_Machine_Learning_Based_Detection_of_Flow_Disturbances_Using_Surface_Pressure_Measurements","328295872_Inferring_flow_parameters_and_turbulent_configuration_with_physics-informed_data_assimilation_and_spectral_nudging","327759376_Turbulence_Modeling_in_the_Age_of_Data","323595776_Single_Image_Super-Resolution_Based_on_Multi-Scale_Competitive_Convolutional_Neural_Network","323510050_Extreme_learning_machine_for_reduced_order_modeling_of_turbulent_geophysical_flows","322313274_Application_of_Convolutional_Neural_Network_to_Predict_Airfoil_Lift_Coefficient","322160320_Application_of_Convolutional_Neural_Network_to_Predict_Airfoil_Lift_Coefficient","317356568_A_neural_network_approach_for_the_blind_deconvolution_of_turbulent_flows","270454670_Image_Super-Resolution_Using_Deep_Convolutional_Networks","3177062_Cubic_convolution_interpolation_for_digital_image_processing_IEEE_Trans_Acoust_Speech_Signal_Process","2985446_Gradient-Based_Learning_Applied_to_Document_Recognition","333626382_Synthetic_turbulent_inflow_generator_using_machine_learning","330155467_Deep_learning_of_mixing_by_two_'atoms'_of_stratified_turbulence","325962544_Feedback_Control_of_Karman_Vortex_Shedding_from_a_Cylinder_using_Deep_Reinforcement_Learning","313231782_Deep_learning_in_fluid_dynamics","309270861_Reynolds_averaged_turbulence_modelling_using_deep_neural_networks_with_embedded_invariance","303919186_Tiled_convolutional_neural_networks","303821507_RAISR_Rapid_and_Accurate_Image_Super_Resolution","301331994_Network_Structure_of_Two-Dimensional_Decaying_Isotropic_Turbulence","286512696_Deep_Residual_Learning_for_Image_Recognition","269935079_Adam_A_Method_for_Stochastic_Optimization","223387871_Effect_of_data_standardization_on_neural_network_training","222514804_A_fast_immersed_boundary_method_using_a_nullspace_approach_and_multi-domain_far-field_boundary_conditions","222476217_Automatic_early_stopping_using_cross_validation_Quantifying_the_criteria","222401285_The_Immersed_Boundary_Method_A_Projection_Approach","221619765_Tiled_convolutional_neural_networks","221345737_Rectified_Linear_Units_Improve_Restricted_Boltzmann_Machines_Vinod_Nair"]}
