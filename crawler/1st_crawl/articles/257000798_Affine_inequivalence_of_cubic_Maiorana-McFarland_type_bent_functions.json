{"id":"257000798_Affine_inequivalence_of_cubic_Maiorana-McFarland_type_bent_functions","abstract":"We consider cubic Maiorana-McFarland-type bent functions having no affine derivatives. Using an invariant proposed by J. F. Dillon [in: Proceedings of the 6th Southeast. Conf. Comb., Graph Theor., Comput.; Boca Raton 1975. 237–249 (1975; Zbl 0346.05003)], we identify subclasses of inequivalent bent functions within this class. These can also be identified by [U. Dempwolff, Commun. Algebra 34, No. 3, 1077–1131 (2006), Theorem B]. However, our technique involves only elementary derivations. We also include some computational results.","authors":["Sugata Gangopadhyay"],"meta":["May 2013Discrete Applied Mathematics 161(s 7–8):1141–1146","DOI:10.1016/j.dam.2012.11.017"],"references":["228720083_Boolean_Functions_for_Cryptography_and_Error_Correcting_Codes","221347992_Two_New_Classes_of_Bent_Functions","3084806_Decomposing_bent_functions","304920734_Difference_sets_in_elementary_abelian_groups","285105779_Boolean_Models_and_Methods_in_Mathematics_Computer_Science_and_Engineering","265334005_Elementary_Hadamard_difference_sets","256391988_On_bent_functions","238865805_Automorphisms_and_Equivalence_of_Bent_Functions_and_of_Difference_Sets_in_Elementary_Abelian_2Groups","235112722_Difference_sets_in_elementary_abelian_groups","220313860_On_the_Lower_Bounds_of_the_Second_Order_Nonlinearity_of_some_Boolean_Functions_Information_Sciences","220261628_On_affine_nonequivalence_of_Boolean_functions","220193495_Cubic_bent_functions"]}
