{"id":"301879766_The_efficient_certification_of_knottedness_and_Thurston_norm","abstract":"We show that the problem of determining whether a knot in the 3-sphere is non-trivial lies in NP. This is a consequence of the following more general result. The problem of determining whether the Thurston norm of a second homology class in a compact orientable irreducible 3-manifold with (possibly empty) toroidal boundary is equal to a given integer is in NP. As a corollary, the problem of determining the genus of a knot in the 3-sphere is in NP.","authors":["Marc Lackenby"],"meta":["April 2016Advances in Mathematics 387(4)","DOI:10.1016/j.aim.2021.107796"],"references":["243072367_Seifert_fibered_spaces_in_irreducible_sufficiently-large_3-manifolds","242529283_Algorithms_for_the_complete_decomposition_of_a_closed_3-manifold","225577999_The_Size_of_Spanning_Disks_for_Polygonal_Curves","2742684_The_number_of_Reidemeister_Moves_Needed_for_Unknotting","2142142_The_size_of_spanning_disks_for_polygonal_curves","2139926_The_Computational_Complexity_of_Knot_and_Link_Problems","2113648_Sphere_recognition_lies_in_NP","2107383_Triangulations_of_fibre-free_Haken_3-manifolds","2102303_The_Computational_Complexity_of_Knot_Genus_and_Spanning_Area","2096249_The_size_of_triangulations_supporting_a_given_link","344082978_The_computational_complexity_of_knot_genus_and_spanning_area","315328839_Foliations_and_the_topology_of_3-manifolds","313172435_On_irreducible_3-manifolds_which_are_sufficiently_large","289895045_Triangulations_of_fibre-free_haken_3-manifolds","266536759_Knottedness_is_in_modulo_GRH","252397296_Dehn_surgery_on_knots_in_3-manifolds","248553777_Essential_laminations_and_Kneser_normal_form","244964267_A_norm_for_the_homology_of_3-manifolds","243719841_Homotopy_Equivalences_of_3-Manifolds_with_Boundaries","242992636_Taut_normal_surfaces","242373359_An_algorithm_to_decide_if_a_3-manifold_is_a_Haken_manifold","240473640_Sutured_manifolds_and_generalized_Thurston_norms","240014954_Genera_of_the_arborescent_links","225258093_The_computational_complexity_of_basic_decision_problems_in_3-dimensional_topology","222300058_Decision_problems_in_the_space_of_Dehn_fillings","43795229_Algorithmic_Topology_and_Classification_of_3-Manifolds","34919651_Foliations_and_genera_of_links","29871638_On_Irreducible_3-Manifolds_Which_are_Sufficiently_Large","2142254_Exceptional_surgery_curves_in_triangulated_3-manifolds","1733745_The_crossing_number_of_composite_knots"]}
