{"id":"276481718_Numerical_Analysis_of_Penalty_Stabilized_Finite_Element_Discretizations_of_Evolution_Navier-Stokes_Equations","abstract":"We perform in this paper the numerical analysis of some penalty stabilized solvers for the unsteady Navier-Stokes equations. We consider low-order and high-order methods. The low-order method is a pure penalty method, while the high-order one is a projection-stabilized method. We perform their numerical analysis (stability and convergence) for solutions that only need to bear the natural regularity. In this analysis, the stability is based upon specific inf-sup conditions. No local orthogonality properties are needed for the projection-interpolation operator. The convergence is based upon the representation of the stabilizing terms by means of bubble finite element spaces. We include some numerical tests for realistic flows that confirm the theoretical expectations.","authors":["Tom치s Chac칩n Rebollo","Macarena G칩mez M치rmol","M.
