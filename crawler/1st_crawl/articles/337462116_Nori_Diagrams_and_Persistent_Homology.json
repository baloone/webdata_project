{"id":"337462116_Nori_Diagrams_and_Persistent_Homology","abstract":"Recently, it was found that there is a remarkable intuitive similarity between studies in theoretical computer science dealing with large data sets on the one hand, and categorical methods of topology and geometry in pure mathematics, on the other. In this article, we treat the key notion of persistency from computer science in the algebraic geometric context involving Nori motivic constructions and related methods. We also discuss model structures for persistent topology.","authors":["Yuri I.
