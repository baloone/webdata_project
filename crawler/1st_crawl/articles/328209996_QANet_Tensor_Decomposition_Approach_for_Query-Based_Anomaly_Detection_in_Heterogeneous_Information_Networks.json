{"id":"328209996_QANet_Tensor_Decomposition_Approach_for_Query-Based_Anomaly_Detection_in_Heterogeneous_Information_Networks","abstract":"Complex networks have now become integral parts of modern information infrastructures. This paper proposes a user-centric method for detecting anomalies in heterogeneous information networks, in which nodes and/or edges might be from different types. In the proposed anomaly detection method, users interact directly with the system and anomalous entities can be detected through queries. Our approach is based on tensor decomposition and clustering methods. We also propose a network generation model to construct synthetic heterogeneous information network to test the performance of the proposed method. The proposed anomaly detection method is compared with state-of-the-art methods in both synthetic and real-world networks. Experimental results show that the proposed tensor-based method considerably outperforms the existing anomaly detection methods.","authors":["Vahid Ranjbar","Mostafa Salehi","Pegah Jandaghi","Mahdi Jalili"],"meta":["October 2019IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering 31(11):2178-2189","DOI:10.1109/TKDE.2018.2873391","Projects: Multilayer/Heterogeneous Network AnalysisAnomaly Detection in Heterogeneous Information Networks"],"references":["325931536_Information_Spread_and_Topic_Diffusion_in_Heterogeneous_Information_Networks","314160993_NetSpam_A_Network-Based_Spam_Detection_Framework_for_Reviews_in_Online_Social_Media","313494864_Link_prediction_in_multiplex_online_social_networks","301251852_An_Anomaly_Detection_Algorithm_of_Cloud_Platform_Based_on_Self-Organizing_Maps","323601828_Bayesian_analysis_of_some_outlier_problems_in_time_series","316805467_An_Introduction_to_Kolmogorov_Complexity_and_Its_Applications","309499071_Contextual_anomaly_detection_for_cyber-physical_security_in_Smart_Grids_based_on_an_artificial_neural_network_model","308809538_Reducing_Features_of_KDD_CUP_1999_Dataset_for_Anomaly_Detection_Using_Back_Propagation_Neural_Network","293638089_Tensor-based_anomaly_detection_An_interdisciplinary_survey","290215005_MalSpot_Multi2_Malicious_Network_Behavior_Patterns_Analysis"]}
