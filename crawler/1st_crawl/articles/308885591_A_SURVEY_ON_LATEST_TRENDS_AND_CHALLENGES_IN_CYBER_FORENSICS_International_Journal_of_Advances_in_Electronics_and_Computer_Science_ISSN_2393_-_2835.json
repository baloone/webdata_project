While\nmany tools exist and much research is being undertaken, many questions exist regarding the future of\nthe \ndomain. Widely published literature analyses the challenges that exist within the domain, from the i\nncreasing volume of data \nto the varying technology\nplatforms and systems that exist. Having gone through various literatures, it is understood that the\nlack of effective evidence data acquisition methods because of diversity of technology and their dep\nloyment platforms and \nthe lack of effective models to \nprocess large volume of data to analyze are key limiting factors in this domain. This paper \nreviews the existing forensic models, defines cyber\n-\ncrime and focuses on challenges in this domain.","authors":["Asha Joseph","K.
