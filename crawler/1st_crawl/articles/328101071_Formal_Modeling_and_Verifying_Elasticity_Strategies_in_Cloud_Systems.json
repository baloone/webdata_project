{"id":"328101071_Formal_Modeling_and_Verifying_Elasticity_Strategies_in_Cloud_Systems","abstract":"Elasticity property allows cloud systems to adapt to their input workload by provisioning and deprovisioning resources as the demand grows and drops. However, due to the unpredictable nature of workload, providing accurate action plans to manage a cloud system’s elasticity is a particularly challenging task. In this paper, we propose a BRS (short for Bigraphical Reactive Systems) based approach to provide a formal modeling of cloud systems’ structure using bigraphs, and their elastic behaviors using bigraphical reaction rules. We introduce elasticity strategies to describe cloud systems’ auto-adaptation behaviors. One step further, we encode the bigraphical specifications into Maude language to enable an autonomic executability of the elastic behaviors and verify their correctness. Finally, we propose a queuing-based approach to discuss and analyze elasticity strategies in cloud systems through different simulated scenarios.","authors":["Khaled Khebbeb","Nabil Hameurlain","Faiza Belala","Hamza Sahli"],"meta":["October 2018IET Software 13(1)","DOI:10.1049/iet-sen.2018.5030","Project: Formal Specification of Elastic Behaviors in Cloud Systems"],"references":["326344970_A_Survey_and_Taxonomy_of_Self-Aware_and_Self-Adaptive_Cloud_Autoscaling_Systems","301924344_Elasticity_in_cloud_computing_What_it_is_and_what_it_is_not","321468967_Formal_verification_approaches_and_standards_in_the_cloud_computing_A_comprehensive_and_systematic_review","320646650_Using_Formal_Model_for_Evaluation_of_Business_Processes_Elasticity_in_the_Cloud","319055013_La_theorie_des_files_d'attente_des_chaines_de_Markov_aux_reseaux_a_forme_produit","317837504_Markov_Chains_and_Stochastic_Stability","308963147_Big_Red_A_Development_Environment_for_Bigraphs","305258716_BigraphER_Rewriting_and_Analysis_Engine_for_Bigraphs","303740136_A_Bigraphical_Model_for_Specifying_Cloud-Based_Elastic_Systems_and_Their_Behaviour","283056848_Modeling_evaluation_and_provisioning_of_elastic_service-based_business_processes_in_the_cloud"]}
