{"id":"240615213_LinkedGeoData_A_Core_for_a_Web_of_Spatial_Open_Data","abstract":"The Semantic Web eases data and information integration tasks by providing an infrastructure based on RDF and ontologies. In this paper, we contribute to the development of a spatial Data Web by elaborating on how the collaboratively collected OpenStreetMap data can be interactively transformed and represented adhering to the RDF data model. This transformation will simplify information integration and aggregation tasks that require comprehensive background knowledge related to spatial features such as ways, structures, and landscapes. We describe how this data is interlinked with other spatial data sets, how it can be made accessible for machines according to the Linked Data paradigm and for humans by means of several applications, including a faceted geo-browser. The spatial data, vocabularies, interlinks and some of the applications are openly available in the LinkedGeoData project.","authors":["Claus Stadler","Jens Lehmann","Konrad Höffner","Sören Auer"],"meta":["January 2012Semantic Web 3(4):333-354","DOI:10.3233/SW-2011-0052"],"references":["256297018_Bringing_Relational_Databases_into_the_Semantic_Web_A_Survey","240615202_A_Survey_of_Current_Approaches_for_Mapping_of_Relational_Databases_to_RDF","228638267_Silk-A_Link_Discovery_Framework_for_the_Web_of_Data","221589415_GeoLinked_data_and_INSPIRE_through_an_application_case","221466269_LinkedGeoData_Adding_a_Spatial_Dimension_to_the_Web_of_Data","272353260_SPARQL_query_language_for_RDF_W3C_Recommendation","225919690_Citizens_as_Sensors_The_World_of_Volunteered_Geography","225138402_Core_Elements_of_Digital_Gazetteers_Placenames_Categories_and_Footprints","222705922_DBpedia_-_A_Crystallization_Point_for_the_Web_of_Data","221607220_Similarity-Based_Information_Retrieval_and_Its_Role_within_Spatial_Data_Infrastructures"]}
