{"id":"291179293_Metrology_Problems_in_General_Engineering_A_Comparison_with_Precision_Engineering","abstract":"Metrology problems in General Engineering are remarkable for their durability. Machine tools are inherently impossible to build for operation under strict principles of ideal metrology, unless the number of axis is restricted. The result is error build-ups so complicated that a total assessment is almost never attempted. Secular stability of materials is still a problem, distortion of workpieces under cutting or clamping loads an every day occurance. No magic cures or breakthroughs are in prospect. The sometimes spectacular results obtained on Precision Engineering type of machines come first of all from close attention and analysis of the complete system and optimizing whatever leads itself to such attacks. The efforts involved seem completely out of proportion for General Engineering. Yet even when solutions are exotic, their analysis differs only in magnitude from what every machinist should know. Some of the more interesting ones are described.","authors":["E.G.
