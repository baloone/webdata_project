{"id":"308877714_Solving_complex_multi-UAV_mission_planning_problems_using_multi-objective_genetic_algorithms","abstract":"Due to recent booming of unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) technologies, these are being used in many fields involving complex tasks. Some of them involve a high risk to the vehicle driver, such as fire monitoring and rescue tasks, which make UAVs excellent for avoiding human risks. Mission planning for UAVs is the process of planning the locations and actions (loading/dropping a load, taking videos/pictures, acquiring information) for the vehicles, typically over a time period. These vehicles are controlled from ground control stations (GCSs) where human operators use rudimentary systems. This paper presents a new multi-objective genetic algorithm for solving complex mission planning problems involving a team of UAVs and a set of GCSs. A hybrid fitness function has been designed using a constraint satisfaction problem to check whether solutions are valid and Pareto-based measures to look for optimal solutions. The algorithm has been tested on several datasets, optimizing different variables of the mission, such as the makespan, the fuel consumption, and distance. Experimental results show that the new algorithm is able to obtain good solutions; however, as the problem becomes more complex, the optimal solutions also become harder to find.","authors":["Cristian Ramirez-Atencia","Gema Bello Orgaz","Mar√≠a D.
