{"id":"241175767_An_extended_role_based_access_control_model_for_the_Internet_of_Things","abstract":"The Internet of Things is a rapidly growing concept in recent years. It refers to the idea that every physical thing in this world can be also connected to the Internet as well as computers. As the development of embedded systems, computing, and networking, the growing number of physical objects in our daily life become addressable through a network, however, more and more resources along with privacy and value of information they hold are exposed over the network, this brings a serious threat to the existing security system. In this paper, we make the physical objects easily seamless integrated and manageable through the use of services. In addition, we propose an extended role based access control model using the context information, which can effectively enhance the security for web services applications and produce more perfect mechanism of access control for the Internet of Things.","authors":["Guoping Zhang","Jiazheng Tian"],"meta":["October 2010","DOI:10.1109/ICINA.2010.5636381"],"references":["232618757_Temporal_and_Location-Based_RBAC_Model","221142742_The_Internet_of_Things_in_an_Enterprise_Context","220855076_NIST_model_for_role-based_access_control_Towards_a_unified_standard","220706095_Socrades_A_Web_Service_Based_Shop_Floor_Integration_Infrastructure","220141486_Understanding_and_Using_Context","50517397_SOA-Based_Integration_of_the_Internet_of_Things_in_Enterprise_Services","2624207_The_NIST_model_for_role-based_access_control","274074381_Web_services_description_language_WSDL","224501425_Package-Role_Based_Authorization_Control_Model_for_Wireless_Network_Services","221504300_Using_Web_Services_for_Bridging_End-User_Applications_and_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","220984768_Extended_Role-Based_Security_System_Using_Context_Information","4333925_Context-Aware_Environment-Role-Based_Access_Control_Model_for_Web_Services","4199969_A_context-aware_role-based_access_control_model_for_Web_services","4105081_A_role_based_access_control_for_Web_services"]}
