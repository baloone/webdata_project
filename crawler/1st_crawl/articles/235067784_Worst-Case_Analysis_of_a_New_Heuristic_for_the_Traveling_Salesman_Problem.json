{"id":"235067784_Worst-Case_Analysis_of_a_New_Heuristic_for_the_Traveling_Salesman_Problem","abstract":"An O(n sup 3) heuristic algorithm is described for solving n-city travelling salesman problems (TSP) whose cost matrix satisfies the triangularity condition. The algorithm involves as substeps the computation of a shortest spanning tree of the graph G defining the TSP, and the finding of a minimum cost perfect matching of a certain induced subgraph of G. A worst-case analysis of this heuristic shows that the ratio of the answer obtained to the optimum TSP solution is strictly less than 3/2. This represents a 50% reduction over the value 2 which was the previously best known such ratio for the performance of other polynomial-growth algorithms for the TSP.","authors":["Nicos Christofides"],"meta":["February 1976"],"references":[]}
