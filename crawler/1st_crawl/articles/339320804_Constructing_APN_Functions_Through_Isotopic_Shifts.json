{"id":"339320804_Constructing_APN_Functions_Through_Isotopic_Shifts","abstract":"Almost perfect nonlinear (APN) functions over fields of characteristic 2 play an important role in cryptography, coding theory and, more generally, mathematics and information theory. In this paper we deduce a new method for constructing APN functions by studying the isotopic equivalence, concept defined for quadratic planar functions in fields of odd characteristic. In particular, we construct a family of quadratic APN functions which provides a new example of an APN mapping over \n${\\mathbb F}_{2^{9}}$ \nand includes an example of another APN function \n$x^{9}+ \\mathop {\\mathrm {Tr}}\\nolimits (x^{3})$ \nover \n${\\mathbb F}_{2^{8}}$ \n, known since 2006 and not classified up to now. We conjecture that the conditions for this family are satisfied by infinitely many APN functions.","authors":["Lilya Budaghyan","Marco Calderini","Claude Carlet","Robert S Coulter"],"meta":["February 2020IEEE Transactions on Information Theory PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TIT.2020.2974471"],"references":["299476673_Equivalences_of_power_APN_functions_with_power_or_quadratic_APN_functions","225760576_New_commutative_semifields_defined_by_PN_multinomials","221348032_Detection_of_Algebraic_Manipulation_with_Applications_to_Robust_Secret_Sharing_and_Fuzzy_Extractors","220638300_Codes_Bent_Functions_and_Permutations_Suitable_For_DES-like_Cryptosystems","2120754_New_Classes_of_Almost_Bent_and_Almost_Perfect_Nonlinear_Polynomials","314292343_Some_Results_on_the_Known_Classes_of_Quadratic_APN_Functions","313472629_Differentially_uniform_mappings_for_cryptography","266542665_Counting_Matrices_with_Coordinates_in_Finite_Fields_and_of_Fixed_Rank","265438233_APN_polynomials_and_related_codes","265334048_Finite_division_algebras_and_finite_planes","264243156_A_matrix_approach_for_constructing_quadratic_APN_functions","251093742_Planes_of_order_n_with_collineation_groups_of_order_n_2","224089093_On_a_construction_of_quadratic_APN_functions","222831519_Constructing_new_APN_functions_from_known_ones","222668256_Commutative_presemifields_and_semifields","221348406_Perfect_Nonlinear_S-Boxes","220638984_On_the_classification_of_APN_functions_up_to_dimension_5","220335739_A_new_almost_perfect_nonlinear_function_which_is_not_quadratic","3081312_Maximal_Recursive_Sequences_with_3-Valued_Recursive_Cross-Correlation_Functions"]}
