{"id":"275635378_GPU_accelerated_SVM_with_sparse_sliced_EllR-T_matrix_format","abstract":"This paper presents the SECu-SVM algorithm for solving classification problems. It allows for a significant acceleration of the standard SVM implementations by transferring the most time-consuming computations from the standard CPU to the Graphics Processor Units (GPU). In addition, highly efficient Sliced EllR-T sparse matrix format was used for storing the dataset in GPU memory, which requires a very low memory footprint and is also well adapted to parallel processing. Performed experiments demonstrate an acceleration of 4-100 times over LibSVM. Moreover, in the majority of cases the SECu-SVM is less time-consuming than the best sparse GPU implementations and allows for handling significantly larger classification datasets.","authors":["Krzysztof Sopy≈Ça","Pawel Drozda"],"meta":["February 2015International Journal of Artificial Intelligence Tools 24(01):1450012","DOI:10.1142/S0218213014500122"],"references":["225292200_Fast_deformable_registration_on_the_GPU_A_CUDA_implementation_of_demons","221653970_Training_linear_SVMs_in_linear_time","221618614_The_Tradeoffs_of_Large_Scale_Learning","221345076_Fast_support_vector_machine_training_and_classification_on_graphics_processors","221193414_Improving_the_Performance_of_the_Sparse_Matrix_Vector_Product_with_GPUs","220320158_SGD-QN_Careful_Quasi-Newton_Stochastic_Gradient_Descent","220319909_Erratum_SGDQN_is_Less_Careful_than_Expected","215601307_A_Dual_Coordinate_Descent_Method_for_Large-scale_Linear_SVM","49853605_CUDA-BLASTP_accelerating_BLASTP_on_CUDA-enabled_graphics_hardware","5598864_Support_vector_machines_for_histogram-based_image_classification","2464475_Training_Support_Vector_Machines_an_Application_to_Face_Detection","272623654_Libsvm","236658406_A_memory_efficient_and_fast_sparse_matrix_vector_product_on_a_GPU","228671354_Large-Scale_Machine_Learning_with_Stochastic_Gradient_Descent","221226850_Support_Vector_Machines_on_GPU_with_Sparse_Matrix_Format","220343922_Support_Vector_Network","220320025_Working_Set_Selection_Using_Second_Order_Information_for_Training_Support_Vector_Machines"]}
