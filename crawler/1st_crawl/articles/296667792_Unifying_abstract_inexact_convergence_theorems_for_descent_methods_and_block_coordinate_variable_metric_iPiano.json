{"id":"296667792_Unifying_abstract_inexact_convergence_theorems_for_descent_methods_and_block_coordinate_variable_metric_iPiano","abstract":"An abstract convergence theorem for a class of descent method that explicitly models relative errors is proved. The convergence theorem generalizes and unifies several recent abstract convergence theorems, and is applicable to possibly non-smooth and non-convex lower semi-continuous functions that satisfy the Kurdyka--{\\L}ojasiewicz inequality, which comprises a huge class of problems. The descent property is measured with respect to a function that is allowed to change along the iterations, which makes block coordinate and variable metric methods amenable to the abstract convergence theorem. As a particularly algorithm, the convergence of a block coordinate variable metric version of iPiano (an inertial forward--backward splitting algorithm) is proved. The newly introduced algorithms perform favorable on an inpainting problem with a Mumford--Shah-like regularization from image processing.","authors":["Peter Ochs"],"meta":["February 2016SIAM Journal on Optimization 29(1)","DOI:10.1137/17M1124085"],"references":["281047600_A_block_coordinate_variable_metric_forward-backward_algorithm","279825155_Long_term_motion_analysis_for_object_level_grouping_and_nonsmooth_optimization_methods","279808820_Peaceman-Rachford_splitting_for_a_class_of_nonconvex_optimization_problems","275670577_Splitting_Methods_with_Variable_Metric_for_Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz_Functions_and_General_Convergence_Rates","268743112_Variable_Metric_Forward-Backward_Algorithm_for_Minimizing_the_Sum_of_a_Differentiable_Function_and_a_Convex_Function","266571973_Convergence_of_Non-smooth_Descent_Methods_Using_the_Kurdyka-Aojasiewicz_Inequality","266396544_An_inertial_forward-backward_algorithm_for_the_minimization_of_the_sum_of_two_nonconvex_functions","266319594_Douglas-Rachford_splitting_for_nonconvex_feasibility_problems","265434928_Tame_Topology_and_O-Minimal_Structures","265368660_On_gradients_of_functions_definable_in_o-minimal_structures","265201859_A_Block_Coordinate_Descent_Method_for_Regularized_Multiconvex_Optimization_with_Applications_to_Nonnegative_Tensor_Factorization_and_Completion","263663231_Global_Convergence_of_Splitting_Methods_for_Nonconvex_Composite_Optimization","262840868_An_Inertial_Tseng's_Type_Proximal_Algorithm_for_Nonsmooth_and_Nonconvex_Optimization_Problems","261726149_iPiano_Inertial_Proximal_Algorithm_for_Non-Convex_Optimization","260289539_The_Lojasiewicz_inequality_for_nonsmooth_subanalytic_functions_with_applications_to_subgradient_dynamical_systems"]}
