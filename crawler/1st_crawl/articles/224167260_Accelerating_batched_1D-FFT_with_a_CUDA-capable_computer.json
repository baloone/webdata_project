{"id":"224167260_Accelerating_batched_1D-FFT_with_a_CUDA-capable_computer","abstract":"This work concerns the application of CUDA-based software (Compute Unified Device Architecture), developed by NVIDIA for programmable Graphics Processing units (GPUs). CUDA code is written in 'C for CUDA', indicating the standard C programming language with NVIDIA extensions.Our goal was to find out, whether batched (multiple) one-dimensional Fast Fourier Transformation (1DFFT), often encountered in various fields of signal processing, can be speeded up significantly by exploiting the parellel-processing power of a low-cost, standard, CUDA-enabled graphics card in a home-assembled PC.","authors":["Ruan de Beer","D. van Ormondt","FÃ¡bio De Cesare","D.J Graveron-Demilly"],"meta":["August 2010","DOI:10.1109/IST.2010.5548530","SourceIEEE Xplore","Conference: Imaging Systems and Techniques (IST), 2010 IEEE International Conference on"],"references":["231108909_Quantitation_of_magnetic_resonance_spectroscopy_signals_The_jMRUI_software_package","224344360_jMRUI_Version_4_A_plug-in_platform","231097392_In_Vivo_Quantitation_of_Metabolites_with_an_incomplete_Model_Function"]}
