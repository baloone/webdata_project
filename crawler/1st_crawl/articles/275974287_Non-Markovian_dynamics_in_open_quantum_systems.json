{"id":"275974287_Non-Markovian_dynamics_in_open_quantum_systems","abstract":"The dynamical behavior of open quantum systems plays a key role in many\napplications of quantum mechanics, examples ranging from fundamental problems,\nsuch as the environment-induced decay of quantum coherence and relaxation in\nmany-body systems, to applications in condensed matter theory, quantum\ntransport, quantum chemistry and quantum information. In close analogy to a\nclassical Markov process, the interaction of an open quantum system with a\nnoisy environment is often modelled by a dynamical semigroup with a generator\nin Lindblad form, which describes a memoryless dynamics leading to an\nirreversible loss of characteristic quantum features. However, in many\napplications open systems exhibit pronounced memory effects and a revival of\ngenuine quantum properties such as quantum coherence and correlations. Here,\nrecent results on the rich non-Markovian quantum dynamics of open systems are\ndiscussed, paying particular attention to the rigorous mathematical definition,\nto the physical interpretation and classification, as well as to the\nquantification of memory effects. The general theory is illustrated by a series\nof examples. The analysis reveals that memory effects of the open system\ndynamics reflect characteristic features of the environment which opens a new\nperspective for applications, namely to exploit a small open system as a\nquantum probe signifying nontrivial features of the environment it is\ninteracting with. This article further explores the various physical sources of\nnon-Markovian quantum dynamics, such as structured spectral densities, nonlocal\ncorrelations between environmental degrees of freedom and correlations in the\ninitial system-environment state, in addition to developing schemes for their\nlocal detection. Recent experiments on the detection, quantification and\ncontrol of non-Markovian quantum dynamics are also discussed.","authors":["Heinz-Peter Breuer","Elsi-Mari Laine","Jyrki Piilo","Bassano Vacchini"],"meta":["April 2016Review of Modern Physics 88(2):021002","DOI:10.1103/RevModPhys.88.021002","SourcearXiv"],"references":["284748908_Experimental_detection_of_polarization-frequency_quantum_correlations_in_a_photonic_quantum_channel_by_local_operations","274730493_Experimental_observation_of_weak_non-Markovianity","270824628_Characterizing_non-Markovianity_via_quantum_interferometric_power","268820009_All-optical_non-Markovian_stroboscopic_quantum_simulator","268814792_Non-Markovianity_through_flow_of_information_between_system_and_environment","268227392_Two-step_procedure_to_discriminate_discordant_from_classical_correlated_or_factorized_states","266896991_Quantum_regression_theorem_and_non-Markovianity_of_quantum_dynamics","264127012_Non-Markovianity_and_reservoir_memory_of_quantum_channels_A_quantum_information_theory_perspective","262795802_Non-Markovianity_through_Accessible_Information","261606187_Degree_of_Non-Markovianity_of_Quantum_Evolution","261516696_Nonlocal_memory_effects_allow_perfect_teleportation_with_mixed_states","261288943_Smallest_set_for_non-Markovian_dynamics_in_collisional_models","260910425_Locality_and_universality_of_quantum_memory_effects","260295423_What_we_talk_about_when_we_talk_about_non-Markovianity","260267593_Canonical_form_of_master_equations_and_characterization_of_non-Markovianity","258345922_Competition_between_memory-keeping_and_memory-erasing_decoherence_channels","257981858_Vanishing_quantum_discord_is_not_necessary_for_completely_positive_maps","255786250_Detecting_initial_system-environment_correlations_Performance_of_various_distance_measures_for_quantum_states","247768977_Probing_the_degree_of_non-Markovianity_for_independent_and_common_environments","236965828_Observation_of_non-Markovian_micro-mechanical_Brownian_motion","236642522_Photonic_realization_of_nonlocal_memory_effects_and_non-Markovian_quantum_probes","235726602_Geometrical_characterization_of_non-Markovianity","235638905_Two-qubit_non-Markovianity_induced_by_a_common_environment","235578437_Alternative_non-Markovianity_measure_by_divisibility_of_dynamical_maps","235427365_Interaction-induced_correlations_and_non-Markovianity_of_quantum_dynamics","235426843_The_Theory_of_Open_Quantum_Systems","235389140_Quantum_Metrology_in_Non-Markovian_Environments","235358262_Quantum_probes_to_assess_correlations_in_a_composite_system","234840956_Non-unital_non-Markovianity_of_quantum_dynamics","304871523_Entanglement_distribution_in_optical_fibers_assisted_by_nonlocal_memory_effects","280630755_Generalized_trace_distance_measure_connecting_quantum_and_classical_non-Markovianity","267185312_Quantum_Phase_Transitions","267054524_The_Mathematical_language_of_Quantum_Theory_From_Uncertainty_to_Entanglement","263891622_Role_of_entanglement_for_nonlocal_memory_effects","262049799_Quantum_Non-Markovianity_Characterization_Quantification_and_Detection","260873446_Observing_a_Quantum_Phase_Transition_by_Measuring_a_Single_Spin","260850247_Erratum_Nonlocal_Memory_Effects_in_the_Dynamics_of_Open_Quantum_Systems_Phys_Rev_Lett_108_210402_2012","258695285_Quantifying_non-Markovianity_via_correlations","258566990_Local_Detection_of_Quantum_Correlations_with_a_Single_Trapped_Ion","258113793_Nonlocal_quantum_memory_effects_in_a_correlated_multimode_field","252716340_Handbook_of_Stochastic_Methods_for_Physics_Chemistry_and_the_Natural_Sciences","252670588_Beyond_Strong_Subadditivity_Improved_Bounds_on_the_Contraction_of_Generalized_Relative_Entropy","243499960_Handbook_of_Stochastic_Methods_for_Physics","238998068_On_Quantum_Theory_of_Transport_Phenomena","235638906_Non-Markovian_qubit_dynamics_induced_by_Coulomb_crystals","235577420_Using_measurement-induced_disturbance_to_characterize_correlations_as_classical_or_quantum","235467236_Stability_of_quantum_motion_in_chaotic_and_regular_systems","235450961_Experimentally_witnessing_the_initial_correlation_between_an_open_quantum_system_and_its_environment","234971995_Ensemble_Method_in_the_Theory_of_Irreversibility","234927107_Completely_positive_dynamical_semigroups_of_TV-level_systems","234813569_Non-Markovian_Equilibration_Controlled_by_Symmetry_Breaking","233909901_Linear_Optics_Simulation_of_Quantum_Non-Markovian_Dynamics","231119827_Markovianity_and_non-Markovianity_in_quantum_and_classical_systems","234060054_Local_witness_for_bipartite_quantum_discord","233866131_Non-Markovian_random_unitary_qubit_dynamics"]}
