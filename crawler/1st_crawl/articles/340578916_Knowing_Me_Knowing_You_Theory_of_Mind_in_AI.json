{"id":"340578916_Knowing_Me_Knowing_You_Theory_of_Mind_in_AI","abstract":"Despite the dramatic advances made in artificial intelligence (AI) and other fields of computer science towards implementing “intelligent” systems expert in specific tasks, the goal of devising algorithms and machines able to interact with human beings just as naturally as other humans do is still elusive. As this naturalness is arguably a consequence of the similarity of the underlying ‘hardware’ (the human brain), it is reasonable to claim that only artificial systems closely inspired by the actual functioning of the human brain and mind have the potential to render this possible. More specifically, the aim of this paper is to propose a new, biologically inspired computational model able to mimic, in a more accurate way than existing ones, the set of functionalities know as Theory of Mind. This is a set of mental processes that allow an individual to attribute mental states to others. In human social interactions this mechanism is crucial, as it allows one to explain the observed behaviour of others, to guess their intentions and to effectively predict their future conduct. This happens by modelling and selecting the most likely (unobservable) mental states of the considered person, which are the primary causes of everyone’s observed actions. The proposed model combines a number of concepts, including those of hierarchical structure, hypotheses pre-activation, and the notion of agent class or ‘stereotype’. It rests on one of the main psychological approaches to Theory of Mind, termed Simulation Theory (ST), and is supported by significant neuroscientific evidence. Crucially, unlike previous efforts in AI, the proposed model puts the learning element at the forefront, in the belief that simulations of other intelligent being’s reasoning processes need to be learned from experience. In this perspective, a possible implementation of the model in terms of deep, reconfigurable neural networks, trained in a reinforcement learning setting, is outlined.","authors":["Fabio Cuzzolin","Andrea Morelli","Bogdan-Ionuţ Cîrstea","B J Sahakian"],"meta":["April 2020Psychological Medicine 50(7):1057-1061","DOI:10.1017/S0033291720000835","Projects: Leverhulme Trust - Theory of mind at the interface of neuroscience and AIHuman-Centric Artificial Intelligence"],"references":["331138581_Deep_neural_networks_in_psychiatry","326996103_Clinically_applicable_deep_learning_for_diagnosis_and_referral_in_retinal_disease","323643196_Satisficing_Models_of_Bayesian_Theory_of_Mind_for_Explaining_Behavior_of_Differently_Uncertain_Agents","322060727_Online_Real-Time_Multiple_Spatiotemporal_Action_Localisation_and_Prediction","342006381_Human_motion_trajectory_prediction_a_survey","339532048_Modeling_engagement_in_long-term_in-home_socially_assistive_robot_interventions_for_children_with_autism_spectrum_disorders","336182455_Theory_of_mind_as_inverse_reinforcement_learning","331793995_Autonomous_Vehicles_That_Interact_With_Pedestrians_A_Survey_of_Theory_and_Practice","331046511_Machine_learning_in_mental_health_A_scoping_review_of_methods_and_applications","323355576_Machine_Theory_of_Mind"]}
