{"id":"308266046_A_Fast_Trie_based_IP_Lookup_Algorithm","abstract":"Routing lookup, also called IP lookup, is still a significant and hot topic in the field of computer science, especially in networking. The Trie is usually used to implement rapid IP lookups, and there are already many IP lookup algorithms. However, there is still room for the further optimizations. To improve the algorithm efficiency, this paper designs a new IP lookup algorithm based on the binary trie. We also proved our proposed algorithm is effective and memory efficiency.","authors":["John Smith"],"meta":["September 2016"],"references":["284282852_A_Shifting_Bloom_Filter_Framework_for_Set_Queries","266660068_Guarantee_IP_Lookup_Performance_with_FIB_Explosion","261493673_CLUE_Achieving_Fast_Update_over_Compressed_Table_for_Parallel_Lookup_with_Reduced_Dynamic_Redundancy","261234251_An_ultra-fast_universal_incremental_update_algorithm_for_trie-based_routing_lookup","254463030_Approaching_optimal_compression_with_fast_update_for_large_scale_routing_tables","221164227_Achieving_O1_IP_lookup_on_GPU-based_software_routers","313753863_Fast_Address_Lookups_using_Controlled_Prefix_Expansion","243574042_Scalability_of_the_internet_backbone_routing_infrastructure","242100114_Un_mecanisme_optimise_de_recherche_de_route_IP","240358131_Tracking_the_Internet''s_BGP_Table","221164071_Small_Forwarding_Tables_for_Fast_Routing_Lookups","220880913_A_Tree-Based_Packet_Routing_Table_for_Berkeley_Unix","220430389_Morrison_DR_PATRICIA_-_Practical_algorithm_to_retrieve_information_coded_in_alphanumeric_Journal_of_the_ACM_154_514-534","220424808_SpaceTime_Trade-Offs_in_Hash_Coding_With_Allowable_Errors","220195172_Tree_bitmap_hardwaresoftware_IP_lookups_with_incremental_updates"]}
