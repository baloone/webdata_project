{"id":"320014293_FiLM_Visual_Reasoning_with_a_General_Conditioning_Layer","abstract":"We introduce a general-purpose conditioning method for neural networks called FiLM: Feature-wise Linear Modulation. FiLM layers influence neural network computation via a simple, feature-wise affine transformation based on conditioning information. We show that FiLM layers are highly effective for visual reasoning - answering image-related questions which require a multi-step, high-level process - a task which has proven difficult for standard deep learning methods that do not explicitly model reasoning. Specifically, we show on visual reasoning tasks that FiLM layers 1) halve state-of-the-art error for the CLEVR benchmark, 2) modulate features in a coherent manner, 3) are robust to ablations and architectural modifications, and 4) generalize well to challenging, new data from few examples or even zero-shot.","authors":["Ethan Perez","Florian Strub","Harm de Vries","Vincent Dumoulin"],"meta":["September 2017"],"references":["332815954_Exploring_the_structure_of_a_real-time_arbitrary_neural_artistic_stylization_network","329740202_Squeeze-and-Excitation_Networks","329740168_Bottom-Up_and_Top-Down_Attention_for_Image_Captioning_and_Visual_Question_Answering","322060367_Inferring_and_Executing_Programs_for_Visual_Reasoning","322057786_Learning_to_Reason_End-to-End_Module_Networks_for_Visual_Question_Answering","320968549_Making_the_V_in_VQA_Matter_Elevating_the_Role_of_Image_Understanding_in_Visual_Question_Answering","320967203_CLEVR_A_Diagnostic_Dataset_for_Compositional_Language_and_Elementary_Visual_Reasoning","319770215_A_Learned_Representation_For_Artistic_Style","319770144_Unsupervised_Representation_Learning_with_Deep_Convolutional_Generative_Adversarial_Networks","319185401_Dynamic_Layer_Normalization_for_Adaptive_Neural_Acoustic_Modeling_in_Speech_Recognition"]}
