{"id":"340629919_A_DATA-DEPENDENT_METAHEURISTIC_APPROACH_TO_OPTIMIZE_A_STOCHASTIC_OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION","abstract":"This work provides directions for the evolution of stochastic objective function that has not been obtained from Nature but from a Principle, P, applied to the Data. The motivation for the approach comes from the use of Likelihood Principle in Statistics in my recent paper (IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, 2015), the improved Maximum Likelihood estimates in several Examples, the theoretical results confirming the findings and the current opening of all disciplines towards Data Science, in particular Computer Science. \n\nThese results suggested the indirect evolution of a stochastic objective function derived from Principle P, via the equations to be solved sequentially that should conform with the Principle. The goal is the faster improvement of the Population of solutions.","authors":["Yatracos Yannis"],"meta":["April 2020"],"references":["230636180_Determining_computational_complexity_from_characteristic_'phase_transitions'","227065795_A_comprehensive_survey_of_fitness_approximation_in_evolutionary_computation","220132963_A_survey_on_metaheuristics_for_stochastic_combinatorial_optimization","216300853_Evolutionary_Optimization_in_Uncertain_Environments---A_Survey","327484448_Data-Driven_Evolutionary_Optimization_An_Overview_and_Case_Studies","273393557_MLE's_Bias_Pathology_Model_Updated_MLE_and_Wallace's_Minimum_Message_Length_Method","236853398_Consistent_Estimates_Based_On_Partially_Consistent_Observations","2531504_Searching_for_Backbones_-_A_High-Performance_Parallel_Algorithm_for_Solving_Combinatorial_Optimization_Problems"]}
