{"id":"249657889_SDN-based_Cloud_Computing_Networking_Invited","abstract":"Software Defined Networking (SDN) is a concept which provides the network operators and data centres to\nflexibly manage their networking equipment using software running on external servers. According to the SDN framework, the control and management of the networks, which is usually implemented in software, is\ndecoupled from the data plane. On the other hand cloud computing materializes the vision of utility computing. Tenants can benefit from on-demand provisioning of networking, storage and compute resources according to a pay-per-use business model. In this work we present the networking issues in IaaS and networking and federation challenges that are currently addressed with existing technologies. We also present innovative software-define networking proposals, which are applied to some of the challenges and could be used in future deployments as efficient solutions. cloud computing networking and the potential contribution of softwaredefined networking along with some performance evaluation results are presented in this paper.","authors":["Siamak Azodolmolky","Philipp Wieder","Ramin Yahyapour"],"meta":["June 2013","DOI:10.1109/ICTON.2013.6602678"],"references":["260670876_Data_Center_Network_Virtualization_A_Survey","220851701_Onix_A_Distributed_Control_Platform_for_Large-scale_Production_Networks","220195143_OpenFlow_Enabling_innovation_in_campus_networks","308525443_Onix_A_distributed_control_platform_for_large-scale_production_networks","279402289_NOX","271589473_The_NIST_definition_of_cloud_computing","260670189_Communication_within_Clouds_Open_Standards_and_Proprietary_Protocols_for_Data_Center_Networking","220194963_NOX_Towards_an_operating_system_for_networks"]}
