The RGO-SiNW array heterojunction photodetector is photoresponsive to the visible, near-infrared, mid-infrared, and terahertz wave irradiations at room temperature.","authors":["Yang Cao","Jiayi Zhu","Jia Xu","Junhui He"],"meta":["June 2014Small 10(12)","DOI:10.1002/smll.201303339","SourcePubMed"],"references":["257952929_A_multicolor_broadband_5-20_mm_quaternary-capped_InAsGaAs_quantum_dot_infrared_photodetector","257949708_Tandem_organic_photodetectors_with_tunable_broadband_response","243748846_Graphene_Nanoribbon_Phototransistor_Proposal_and_Analysis","236653320_Broadband_High_Photoresponse_from_Pure_Monolayer_Graphene_Photodetector","235740108_Broadband_Polarization-Sensitive_Photodetector_Based_on_Optically-Thick_Films_of_Macroscopically_Long_Dense_and_Aligned_Carbon_Nanotubes","233975803_GeSnGe_heterostructure_short-wave_infrared_photodetectors_on_silicon","46586774_Graphene_photodetectors_for_high-speed_optical_communications","45901530_Position_dependent_photodetector_from_large_area_reduced_graphene_oxide_thin_films","41429080_Graphene_nanomesh","38070964_Ultrafast_Graphene_Photodetector","24281055_Longitudinal_Unzipping_of_Carbon_Nanotubes_to_Form_Graphene_Nanoribbons","23316149_Temperature-Dependent_Transport_in_Suspended_Graphene","5464808_Fine_Structure_Constant_Defines_Visual_Transparency_of_Graphene","1918954_Device_Model_for_Graphene_Nanoribbon_Phototransistor","238925540_GaN-based_modulation_doped_FETs_and_UV_detectors","235599452_Dependence_of_resistivity_on_electron_density_and_temperature_in_graphene","235373031_Tunable_Graphene-Silicon_Heterojunctions_for_Ultrasensitive_Photodetection","231644224_Preparation_of_Large-Area_Uniform_Silicon_Nanowires_Arrays_through_Metal-Assisted_Chemical_Etching","231505930_Preparation_of_Graphitic_Oxide_J_Am_Chem_Soc_801339","221828808_Zn2GeO4_and_In2Ge2O7_nanowire_mats_based_ultraviolet_photodetectors_on_rigid_and_flexible_substrates","51754713_Hybrid_Heterojunction_Solar_Cell_Based_on_Organic-Inorganic_Silicon_Nanowire_Array_Architecture","51669925_Ultra-High-Responsivity_Broadband_Detection_of_Si_Metal-Semiconductor-Metal_Schottky_Photodetectors_Improved_by_ZnO_Nanorod_Arrays","51518615_Apology_Infrared_Photodetectors_Based_on_Reduced_Graphene_Oxide_and_Graphene_Nanoribbons","45851976_Insulator_to_Semimetal_Transition_in_Graphene_Oxide","45095551_Transparent_Flexible_Conducting_Hybrid_Multi_layer_Thin_Films_of_Multiwalled_Carbon_Nanotubes_with_Graphene_Nanosheets","43081248_Graphene-On-Silicon_Schottky_Junction_Solar_Cells","24281056_Narrow_graphene_nanoribbons_from_carbon_nanotubes","24255594_Rational_Fabrication_of_Graphene_Nanoribbons_Using_a_Nanowire_Etch_Mask","6608014_Aligned_Single-Crystalline_Si_Nanowire_Arrays_for_Photovoltaic_Applications","6161091_Energy_Band-Gap_Engineering_of_Graphene_Nanoribbons"]}
