{"id":"281312251_Stabilizing_Consensus_with_Many_Opinions","abstract":"We consider the following distributed consensus problem: Each node in a\ncomplete communication network of size $n$ initially holds an \\emph{opinion},\nwhich is chosen arbitrarily from a finite set $\\Sigma$. The system must\nconverge toward a consensus state in which all, or almost all nodes, hold the\nsame opinion. Moreover, this opinion should be \\emph{valid}, i.e., it should be\none among those initially present in the system. This condition should be met\neven in the presence of an adaptive, malicious adversary who can modify the\nopinions of a bounded number of nodes in every round.\nWe consider the \\emph{3-majority dynamics}: At every round, every node pulls\nthe opinion from three random neighbors and sets his new opinion to the\nmajority one (ties are broken arbitrarily). Let $k$ be the number of valid\nopinions. We show that, if $k \\leqslant n^{\\alpha}$, where $\\alpha$ is a\nsuitable positive constant, the 3-majority dynamics converges in time\npolynomial in $k$ and $\\log n$ with high probability even in the presence of an\nadversary who can affect up to $o(\\sqrt{n})$ nodes at each round.\nPreviously, the convergence of the 3-majority protocol was known for\n$|\\Sigma| = 2$ only, with an argument that is robust to adversarial errors. On\nthe other hand, no anonymous, uniform-gossip protocol that is robust to\nadversarial errors was known for $|\\Sigma| > 2$.","authors":["Luca Becchetti","Andrea Clementi","Emanuele Natale","Francesco Pasquale"],"meta":["August 2015","DOI:10.1137/1.9781611974331.ch46","SourcearXiv"],"references":["258499624_Efficient_and_Noise-Resilient_rumor-spreading_in_Large_Anonymous_Populations","257592468_Simple_Dynamics_for_Majority_Consensus","236202775_Timing_in_chemical_reaction_networks","230851043_The_Cell_Cycle_Switch_Computes_Approximate_Majority","221406560_Direction_election_in_flocking_swarms","10978410_Information_flow_opinion_polling_and_collective_intelligence_in_house-hunting_social_insects","3880868_Randomized_rumor_spreading","324767808_Markov_Chains_and_Mixing_Times","279258484_Breathe_before_speaking_Efficient_information_dissemination_despite_noisy_limited_and_anonymous_communication","268545255_Analytic_sets_and_stochastic_processes","267987625_Stabilizing_Consensus_With_the_Power_of_Two_Choices","263856092_Plurality_Consensus_in_the_Gossip_Model","262293485_Tight_thresholds_for_cuckoo_hashing_via_XORSAT","254463081_Faster_randomized_consensus_with_an_oblivious_adversary","247931359_Probability_with_Martingales","228115418_Majority_Dynamics_and_Aggregation_of_Information_in_Social_Networks","225685483_A_simple_population_protocol_for_fast_robust_approximate_majority","224500487_Using_Three_States_for_Binary_Consensus_on_Complete_Graphs","224367508_Binary_consensus_with_soft_information_processing_in_cooperative_networks","221344022_Computation_in_networks_of_passively_mobile_finite-state_sensors","221343971_Stably_computable_predicates_are_semilinear","221343918_Epidemic_Algorithms_for_Replicated_Database_Maintenance","220975005_Stabilizing_Consensus_in_Mobile_Networks","220780265_Distributed_Agreement_with_Optimal_Communication_Complexity","220623522_Epidemic_Algorithms_for_Replicated_Database_Maintenance","220431719_Reaching_Agreement_in_the_Presence_of_Faults","4354946_Randomized_Byzantine_generals","4038189_Gossip-based_computation_of_aggregate_information"]}
