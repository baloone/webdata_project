{"id":"288805272_Design_for_intuitive_use_-_Testing_image_schema_theory_for_user_interface_design","abstract":"Demand for interactive products that are intuitive to use is high. Intuitive use in this paper is understood as the subconscious application of prior knowledge by the user. This definition is explicated by a continuum model of prior knowledge. Theories from several disciplines of application are surveyed whether they can contribute to the field of 'Design for Intuitive Use'. Two sets of requirements are posed against which candidate theories have to be validated: (1) the claims the theory makes about intuitive use must be shown to be valid within the context of user interface design, and (2) the application of the theory has to support the user interface design process. Image schema theory which draws on knowledge on the sensorimotor stage of the knowledge continuum was put to the test by using rigorous psychological experimentation and by analysing user interfaces in different domains of application. These analyses showed that the application of image schema theory as a design language may be a powerful tool for the evaluation and improvement phases of a human-centred design process. By collecting the results of these analyses in an online catalogue, designers are provided with a tool that helps them with producing design solutions. Ongoing studies are investigating whether image schemas are also useful for the early phases of the design process such as requirements gathering. Although the studies are not finished yet it is concluded that the image schema approach offers value to and insight in designing user interfaces that are intuitive to use.","authors":["JÃ¶rn Hurtienne","Lucienne Blessing"],"meta":["January 2007","Project: Image-Schematic Metaphors and Intuitive Use"],"references":["285826627_Measuring_usability_Are_effectiveness_efficiency_and_satisfaction_really_correlated","280015034_Intuitivitat_definierbar_beeinflussbar_uberprufbar","257700846_IUUI_-_Intuitive_use_of_user_interfaces","255588286_Metaphors_as_Tools_for_Intuitive_Interaction_with_Technology","225018794_Links_oder_rechts_schneller_oder_langsamer_Grundlegende_Fragestellungen_beim_Cognitive_Systems_Engineering_von_hochautomatisierter_Fahrzeugfuhrung","2242788_Principles_for_Implicit_Learning","292742941_Image_schemas_The_cognitive_psychological_reality_of_image_schemas_and_their_transformations","270376018_The_Body_in_the_Mind--The_Bodily_Basis_of_Meaning_Imagination_and_Reason","264872202_Blink_A_The_Power_of_Thinking_Without_Thinking","249234933_Taking_a_Stand_on_the_Meanings_of_Stand_Bodily_Experience_as_Motivation_for_Polysemy","246811404_Metaphor_in_the_Mind_and_Hands","246069702_Engineering_Psychology_and_Human_Performance_Prentice_Hall","244463733_Grounding_Cognition_The_Role_of_Perception_and_Action_in_Memory","242609402_Information_Processing_and_Human-Machine_Interaction_An_Approach_to_Cognitive_Engineering","242358389_Human_Factors_In_Engineering_and_Design","235705633_Usability_Measurement_in_Context","233821190_Simple_Heuristics_That_Make_Us_Smart","224982394_Principles_of_Gestalt_Psychology","224982323_Ecological_Approach_to_Visual_Perception","221308766_Image_schemas_and_their_metaphorical_extensions_Intuitive_patterns_for_tangible_interaction","220584638_Intuitive_Use_of_User_Interfaces_-_Definition_und_Herausforderungen","37688084_Metaphors_We_Live_by","11431738_The_Roles_of_Body_and_Mind_in_Abstract_Thought","8656522_Why_the_Sunny_Side_Is_Up_Associations_Between_Affect_and_Vertical_Position"]}
