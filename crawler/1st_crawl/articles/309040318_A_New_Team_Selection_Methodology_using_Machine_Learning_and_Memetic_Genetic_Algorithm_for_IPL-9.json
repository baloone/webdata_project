{"id":"309040318_A_New_Team_Selection_Methodology_using_Machine_Learning_and_Memetic_Genetic_Algorithm_for_IPL-9","abstract":"IPL franchises spend massive amounts of money is ensuring that they have the best batting and bowling options according to their game plan. An important problem is to select the playing XI from the available options. The present work focuses on Machine learning based data analytics to provide a good approach to solve this problem. A detailed performance ranking scheme is developed based on Random Forests based Recursive Feature estimation algorithm to rank the players with respect to the other players in fray in IPL 9. The ranking scheme provides percentile scores to the players for their batting and bowling performance and enables them to be compared against each other. The sum of the percentile scores for batting and bowling for the players in a given selection of Playing XI provide the fitness function for measuring the suitability of the team. An SGA and MGA are designed and implemented for search and optimization of the Playing XI and the results are compared. The MGA provides much more balanced XIs than the SGA and can be gainfully utilized for this purpose.","authors":["Chellapilla Deep Prakash"],"meta":["May 2016"],"references":["298801732_A_new_Machine_Learning_based_Deep_Performance_Index_for_Ranking_IPL_T20_Cricketers","259395740_Stochastic_Dominance_and_Analysis_of_ODI_Batting_Performance_the_Indian_Cricket_Team_1989-2005","304984668_Dynamic_Programming_in_One-Day_Cricket-Optimal_Scoring_Rates","287688381_A_measure_for_the_batting_performance_of_cricket_players","279701979_Comparison_of_cricketers'_bowling_and_batting_performances_using_graphical_displays","270663502_Random_Forests","268298324_An_analysis_of_players'_performances_in_the_first_cricket_Twenty20_World_Cup_series","258035774_The_Single_Match_Approach_to_Strike_Rate_Adjustments_in_Batting_Performance_Measures_in_Cricket","256311918_Correlating_the_Analysis_of_Opinionated_Texts_Using_SASR_Text_Analytics_with_Application_of_Sabermetrics_to_Cricket_Statistics","245281340_Extending_the_range_of_player-performance_measures_in_one-day_cricket"]}
