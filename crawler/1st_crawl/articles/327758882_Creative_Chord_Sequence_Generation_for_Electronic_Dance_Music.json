{"id":"327758882_Creative_Chord_Sequence_Generation_for_Electronic_Dance_Music","abstract":"This paper describes the theory and implementation of a digital audio workstation plug-in for chord sequence generation. The plug-in is intended to encourage and inspire a composer of electronic dance music to explore loops through chord sequence pattern definition, position locking and generation into unlocked positions. A basic cyclic first-order statistical model is extended with latent diatonicity variables which permits sequences to depart from a specified key. Degrees of diatonicity of generated sequences can be explored and parameters for voicing the sequences can be manipulated. Feedback on the concepts, interface, and usability was given by a small focus group of musicians and music producers.","authors":["Darrell Conklin","Martin Gasser","Stefan Oertl"],"meta":["September 2018Applied Sciences 8(9):1704","DOI:10.3390/app8091704"],"references":["304490458_Assisted_Lead_Sheet_Composition_Using_FlowComposer","265647076_Predicting_the_Composer_and_Style_of_Jazz_Chord_Progressions","323929963_Musical_Syntax_I_Theoretical_Perspectives","320029367_A_Data-Driven_Model_of_Tonal_Chord_Sequence_Complexity","319002619_Generative_Statistical_Models_with_Self-Emergent_Grammar_of_Chord_Sequences","311488100_ChordRipple_Recommending_Chords_to_Help_Novice_Composers_Go_Beyond_the_Ordinary","305822520_Chord_sequence_generation_with_semiotic_patterns","294286444_Analysing_Symbolic_Music_with_Probabilistic_Grammars","286866341_Audacious_Euphony_Chromatic_Harmony_and_the_Triad's_Second_Nature","264569067_Automatic_Chord_Estimation_from_Audio_A_Review_of_the_State_of_the_Art"]}
