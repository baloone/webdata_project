{"id":"347613148_Judicial_Big_Data_and_Big-Data-Based_Legal_Research_in_China","abstract":"The newly established judicial-transparency platforms, like China Judgements Online, have provided access to a new resource—judicial big data—making it possible to conduct empirical, big-data-based legal research. However, as is often the case with new products, these platforms—China Judgements Online, in particular—pose a few problems for big-data-based legal research: insufficient academic depth; immature technical methods; and lack of innovation due to flawed data, strict technical thresholds, and lack of theoretical ambition and ability. In the future, big-data-based legal research should make use of current data resources, continue to promote statistical science and computer science in research, and apply small-data research methods, and in the meanwhile pay attention to the combination of data and theory.","authors":["Weimin ZUO","Chanyuan WANG"],"meta":["December 2020Asian Journal of Law and Society 7(3):1-20","DOI:10.1017/als.2020.34"],"references":["350892794_The_Concept_of_Law","288657342_Reuniting_'is'_and_'ought'_in_empirical_legal_scholarship","284766595_Predicting_poverty_and_wealth_from_mobile_phone_metadata","265603984_Forecasting_Election_With_Non-Representative_Polls","260139107_Validation_What_Big_Data_Reveal_About_Survey_Misreporting_and_the_Real_Electorate"]}
