{"id":"314949919_Research_Methods_in_Computer_Science_The_Challenges_and_Issues","abstract":"Research methods are essential parts in conducting any research project. Although they have been theorized and summarized based on best practices, every field of science requires an adaptation of the overall approaches to perform research activities. In addition, any specific research needs a particular adjustment to the generalized approach and specializing them to suit the project in hand. However, unlike most well-established science disciplines, computing research is not supported by well-defined, globally accepted methods. This is because of its infancy and ambiguity in its definition, on one hand, and its extensive coverage and overlap with other fields, on the other hand. This article discusses the research methods in science and engineering in general and in computing in particular. It shows that despite several special parameters that make research in computing rather unique, it still follows the same steps that any other scientific research would do. The article also shows the particularities that researchers need to consider when they conduct research in this field.","authors":["Hossein Hassani"],"meta":["March 2017"],"references":["302937543_Ontologies_Principles_methods_and_applications","292332023_Interdisciplinary_research_at_NIH_letter_to_the_editor","304129153_Introduction_to_Research_Understanding_and_Applying_Multiple_Strategies","300757602_Accommodating_Interdisciplinary_Research","300492320_How_to_write_a_good_research_paper","279382592_Encyclopedia_of_Database_Systems","279345259_Encyclopedia_of_Database_Systems","274056240_The_Science_in_Computer_Science","273866289_The_smallest_automation_recognizing_the_subwords_of_a_text","273135528_Research_dilemmas_Paradigms_methods_and_methodology"]}
