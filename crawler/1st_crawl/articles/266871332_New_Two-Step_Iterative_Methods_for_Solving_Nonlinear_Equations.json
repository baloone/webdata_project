{"id":"266871332_New_Two-Step_Iterative_Methods_for_Solving_Nonlinear_Equations","abstract":"In this paper, we have suggested and analyzed a new two-step type iterative methods for solving nonlinear equations of the type. We show that this new two-step method is cubic convergence method. It is proved that this method is better than the Newton method and all results in (Soheili et al., 2008). Several examples are given to illustrate the efficiency of this new method and its comparison with other methods. This method can se considered as a significant improvement of the Newton method and its variant forms.","authors":["Mohamed Bahgat"],"meta":["May 2012Journal of Mathematics Research 4(3)","DOI:10.5539/jmr.v4n3p128"],"references":["233926245_A_Family_of_Predictor-Corrector_Methods_Based_on_Weight_Combination_of_Quadratures_for_Solving_Nonlinear_Equations","222913313_Predictor-corrector_Halley_method_for_nonlinear_equations","220561309_On_iterative_methods_for_nonlinear_equations","324332462_Numerical_Analysis","271562584_New_Iterative_Methods_for_Nonlinear_Equations","245759142_Convex_Analysis_and_Optimization","239755757_On_the_old-new_method_of_solving_nonlinear_equations"]}
