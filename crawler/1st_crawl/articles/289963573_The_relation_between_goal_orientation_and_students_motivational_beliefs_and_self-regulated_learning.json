{"id":"289963573_The_relation_between_goal_orientation_and_students_motivational_beliefs_and_self-regulated_learning","abstract":"The relations between three goal orientations and students' motivational beliefs and self-regulated learning were examined in a correlational study of 434 seventh and eighth grade students. Data were collected over two time points (fall and spring) within one school year with self-report questionnaires. Regression analyses revealed that adopting a learning goal orientation and a relative ability goal orientation resulted in a generally positive pattern of motivational beliefs including adaptive levels of task value, self-efficacy, and test anxiety, as well as cognition including higher levels of cognitive strategy use, selfregulation, and academic performance. Results showed that adopting an extrinsic goal orientation led to more maladaptive motivational and cognitive outcomes. These findings were replicated across three different academic subject areas of English, math, and social studies. Results are discussed in terms of the implications for goal theory.","authors":["Christopher A. Wolters","Shirley L. Yu","Paul R.
