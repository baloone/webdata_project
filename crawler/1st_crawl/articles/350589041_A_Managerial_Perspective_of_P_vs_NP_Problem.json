{"id":"350589041_A_Managerial_Perspective_of_P_vs_NP_Problem","abstract":"This case introduces the deepest unanswered question in computer science, a problem called P vs. NP. Using an analogy of sudoku, we try to understand the core ask of this problem and where the main dilemma lies. We then explore few technical jargons specific to understand this question and finally revisit the problem by exploring a fresh perspective of a decision-maker. The case postulates a managerial analogy to appreciate the complexity of the problem and encourage its implications in interdisciplinary scenarios like decision-execution conundrum.","authors":["Mayukh Mukhopadhyay"],"meta":["March 2021SSRN Electronic Journal (Scopus Article ID 2-s2.0-85110778661)","DOI:10.2139/ssrn.3756754","Project: Business Case Task Force"],"references":["268020465_Perfect_rigor_A_genius_and_the_mathematical_breakthrough_of_the_century","247867825_The_entropy_formula_for_Ricci_flow_and_its_geometric_applications_preprint","247442902_Introduction_To_Algorithms","236628854_Computational_Complexity","2728882_Languages_That_Capture_Complexity_Classes"]}
