{"id":"291615203_Ethical_Perspectives_on_Employee_Participation_in_Planned_Organizational_Change","abstract":"This article reports on a survey of state public welfare executives and local welfare employees in two states and explores respondentsâ€™ views about participation in planned organizational change and about involving employees in planning and the resulting benefits and problems. Respondents in both states were not satisfied with the extent of their participation in planned organizational change within their agencies. Respondents in both states believed that employees should be permitted to participate to a greater extent in planned organizational change, especially in implementing change. Respondents were concerned, however, that participation might raise unrealistic employee expectations and that dissension, fragmentation, and cynicism might result from frustrated expectations.","authors":["John G.
