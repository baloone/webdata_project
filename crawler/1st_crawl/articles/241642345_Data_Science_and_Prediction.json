{"id":"241642345_Data_Science_and_Prediction","abstract":"The world's data is growing more than 40% annually. Coupled withexponentially growing computing horsepower, this provides us withunprecedented basis for 'learning' useful things from the data throughstatistical induction without material human intervention and acting onthem. Philosophers have long debated the merits and demerits ofinduction as a scientific method, the latter being that conclusions arenot guaranteed to be certain and that multiple and numerous models canbe conjured to explain the observed data. I propose that 'big data'brings a new and important perspective to these problems in that itgreatly ameliorates historical concerns about induction, especially ifour primary objective is prediction as opposed to causal modelidentification. Equally significantly, it propels us into an era ofautomated decision making, where computers will make the bulk ofdecisions because it is infeasible or more costly for humans to do so.In this paper, I describe how scale, integration and most importantly,prediction will be distinguishing hallmarks in this coming era of DataScience.' In this brief monograph, I define this newly emerging fieldfrom business and research perspectives.","authors":["Vasant Dhar"],"meta":["March 2012Communications of the ACM 56(12)","DOI:10.2139/ssrn.2086734"],"references":["256438799_Data_Science_for_Business","254008882_Active_Objects_Actions_for_Entity-Centric_Search","242448131_Causation_Prediction_and_Search","236332256_The_structure_of_online_diffusion_networks","225734295_The_Elements_of_Statistical_Learning_Data_Mining_Inference_and_Prediction","220451900_Controlled_experiments_on_the_web_Survey_and_practical_guide","220420371_Computational_thinking","215990041_Tree_Induction_vs_Logistic_Regression_A_Learning-Curve_Analysis","48178170_To_Explain_or_to_Predict","330897725_The_oxford_companion_to_the_history_of_modern_science","312596137_Big_data_The_next_frontier_for_innovation_competition_and_productivity","301036345_Causal_Models","295624658_How_President_Obama's_campaign_used_big_data_to_rally_individual_voters","285058550_Exploratory_Data_Analysis","278712204_The_Fourth_Paradigm_-_Data-Intensive_Scientific_Discovery","234817663_Seven_Methods_for_Transforming_Corporate_Data_into_Business_Intelligence","232549565_The_understanding_process_Problem_isomorphs","227856755_Identifying_Influential_and_Susceptible_Members_of_Social_Networks","227036657_An_exploration_in_the_space_of_mathematics_educations","220527451_Prediction_in_Financial_Markets_The_Case_for_Small_Disjuncts","216435465_The_End_of_Theory_The_Data_Deluge_Makes_the_Scientific_Method_Obsolete","216300763_The_Elements_of_Statistical_Learning_Data_Mining_Inference_and_Prediction","210304643_The_tipping_point_How_little_things_can_make_a_big_difference","3302947_A_comparison_of_nonlinear_methods_for_predicting_earnings_surprises_and_returns"]}
