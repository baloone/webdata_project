{"id":"323748094_Computer_Science_and_Systems_Biology_Integration_towards_Improvement","abstract":"Computer Science and Systems Biology have heralded remarkable technological advances in understanding the complex biological systems including human biochemical, molecular and neural pathways and networks. Systems biology integrates the computer applications and experimental biology in modelingâ€™s, predictions and characterizations of complex and dynamic properties of biological systems. Particularly, multi-omics studies, high-throughput sequencing techniques and microarray techniques made possible the generation of large datasets from biological systems that could help in understanding the comprehensive molecular pathways, systems functions and behaviors. In the last decade, the computer science and systems biology approaches increased the interest in pathway based biomarker identification, identifying disease genes and drug targets, generation of global genetic interaction maps, and development of new diagnosis and therapeutics methods for deadly diseases and contemporary outbreaks. In this letter, I summarize the breakthroughs of the decade and future challenges in uncover the complex components of biological systems.","authors":["Dhilleswara Rao Vana"],"meta":["March 2018Journal of Computer Science & Systems Biology 11(1)","DOI:10.4172/jcsb.1000266"],"references":[]}
