{"id":"345674596_Grey_Wolf_Firefly_and_Bat_Algorithms_Three_Widespread_Algorithms_that_Do_Not_Contain_Any_Novelty","abstract":"In this paper, we carry out a review of the grey wolf, the firefly and the bat algorithms. We identify the concepts involved in these three metaphor-based algorithms and compare them to those proposed in the context of particle swarm optimization. We provide compelling evidence that the grey wolf, the firefly, and the bat algorithms are not novel, but a reiteration of ideas introduced first for particle swarm optimization and reintroduced years later using new natural metaphors. These three algorithms can therefore be added to the growing list of metaphor-based algorithms—to which already belong algorithms such as harmony search and intelligent water drops—that are nothing else than repetitions of old ideas hidden by the usage of new terminology.","authors":["Christian Leonardo Camacho Villalón","Thomas Stützle","Marco Dorigo"],"meta":["October 2020","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-60376-2_10","In book: Swarm Intelligence, 12th International Conference, ANTS 2020, Barcelona, Spain, October 26–28, 2020, Proceedings (pp.121-133)"],"references":["333095330_The_intelligent_water_drops_algorithm_why_it_cannot_be_considered_a_novel_algorithm_A_brief_discussion_on_the_use_of_metaphors_in_optimization","319108337_A_critical_analysis_of_the_improved_Clarke_and_Wright_savings_algorithm_Sorensen_et_al","275670912_A_critical_analysis_of_the_harmony_search_algorithm-How_not_to_solve_sudoku","264038554_Metaheuristics_in_Nature-Inspired_Algorithms","261085705_A_novel_effective_particle_swarm_optimization_like_algorithm_via_extrapolation_technique","260010809_Grey_Wolf_Optimizer","255756848_Standard_Particle_Swarm_Optimisation_2011_at_CEC-2013_A_baseline_for_future_PSO_improvements","237009138_Metaheuristics_--_the_metaphor_exposed","227242104_Differential_Evolution_-_A_Simple_and_Efficient_Heuristic_for_Global_Optimization_over_Continuous_Spaces","220901662_Simple_Dynamic_Particle_Swarms_without_Velocity","220742428_Theoretical_and_empirical_study_of_particle_swarms_with_additive_stochasticity_and_different_recombination_operators","51914274_Why_'GSA_a_Gravitational_Search_Algorithm'_Is_Not_Genuinely_Based_on_the_Law_of_Gravity","45904853_Firefly_Algorithms_for_Multimodal_Optimization","3418783_The_Fully_Imformed_Particle_Swarm_Simpler_Mabe_Better","328025110_Why_the_Intelligent_Water_Drops_Cannot_Be_Considered_as_a_Novel_Algorithm_11th_International_Conference_ANTS_2018_Rome_Italy_October_29-31_2018_Proceedings","316990689_Nature_Inspired_Cooperative_Strategies_for_Optimization_NICSO_2010","313758667_A_new_optimizer_using_particle_swarm_theory","313749844_Particle_swarm_optimization","303167231_Empirical_study_of_particle_swarm_optimization","260803477_How_novel_is_the_novel_black_hole_optimization_approach","239592452_Evolutionsstrategie_-_Optimierung_technischer_Systeme_nach_Prinzipien_der_Biologischen_Information","238218319_Differential_Evolution-A_Practical_Approach_to_Global_Optimization","226755550_Optimization_by_Simulated_Annealing_Quantitative_Studies","220676909_A_Rigorous_Analysis_of_the_Harmony_Search_Algorithm_How_the_Research_Community_can_be_Misled_by_a_Novel_Methodology","220608160_Beyond_Standard_Particle_Swarm_Optimisation","4017046_Bare_bones_particle_swarms","3418787_Self-Organizing_Hierarchical_Particle_Swarm_Optimizer_With_Time-Varying_Acceleration_Coefficients","3418684_Kennedy_J_The_Particle_Swarm_Explosion_Stability_and_Convergence_in_a_Multi-Dimensional_Complex_Space_IEEE_Trans_on_Evolutionary_Computation_6_58-73"]}
