{"id":"302517930_Log-concave_probability_and_its_applications","abstract":"In many applications, assumptions about the log-concavity of a probability distribution allow just enough special structure to yield a workable theory. This paper catalogs a series of theorems relating log-concavity and/or log-convexity of probability density functions, distribution functions, reliability functions, and their integrals. We list a large number of commonly-used probability distributions and report the log-concavity or log-convexity of their density functions and their integrals. We also discuss a variety of applications of log-concavity that have appeared in the literature.","authors":["Mark Bagnoli","Ted Bergstrom"],"meta":["January 2006","DOI:10.1007/3-540-29578-X_11","In book: Rationality and Equilibrium (pp.217-241)"],"references":["332083944_Discrete_Choice_Theory_of_Product_Differentiation","324400586_Distributions_in_Statistics_Continuous_Univariate_Distributions","321330359_Essays_on_Disclosure","313752560_Reliability_models_with_positive_memory_derived_from_the_mean_residual_life_function","269797000_Distributions_In_Statistics_Continuous_Univariate_Distributions_-_2","268493041_Abnormal_selection_bias","263047783_On_Logarithmic_Concave_Measures_and_Functions","247928667_The_Market_for_Lemons_Quality_Uncertainty_and_the_Market_Mechanism","242399511_Statistical_Theory_of_Reliability_and_Life_Testing","239513139_Discrete_Choice_Theory_of_Product_Differentation"]}
