{"id":"339538800_An_Encryption_Scheme_Based_on_Discrete_Quantum_Map_and_Continuous_Chaotic_System","abstract":"Chaotic encryption is a growing field for competently shielding visual data. As well as quantum encryption and substitution also play a significant role in applied fields owing to its prospective use in secure communication. This article offers new method for the encryption by utilizing quantum chaotic maps and continuous chaotic dynamical systems. Since chaotic maps are itself suitable for quality encryption coupled with quantum logistic encryption, substitution box stipulates highly secure encryption program. Quantum logistic map is combined with Liu and Rossler chaotic systems with the intention of improvement in efficiency of data randomness. Designed scheme ensures the security of data with the minimum time of encryption. Outcomes acquired from performance evaluation signifies that projected chaotic encryption program reveals high complexity and security.","authors":["Abdullah Alghafis","Noor Munir","Majid Khan","Iqtadar Hussain"],"meta":["April 2020International Journal of Theoretical Physics 59(12)","DOI:10.1007/s10773-020-04402-7"],"references":["345408351_Application_Based_Construction_and_Optimization_of_Substitution_Boxes_Over_2D_Mixed_Chaotic_Maps","344439041_A_new_construction_of_confusion_component_of_block_ciphers","341314638_A_New_Efficient_Digital_Image_Encryption_Based_on_Inverse_Left_Almost_Semi_Group_and_Lorenz_Chaotic_System","336934500_A_Privacy_Scheme_for_Digital_Images_Based_on_Quantum_Particles","334024679_A_novel_image_encryption_scheme_based_on_Arnold_scrambling_and_Lucas_series","333645502_A_novel_chaotic_image_encryption_technique_based_on_multiple_discrete_dynamical_maps","333580760_A_Novel_Digital_Contents_Privacy_Scheme_Based_on_Kramer's_Arbitrary_Spin","333152124_A_Novel_Image_Encryption_Technique_Based_on_Generalized_Advanced_Encryption_Standard_Based_on_Field_of_Any_Characteristic","330941219_A_new_approach_to_digital_content_privacy_using_quantum_spin_and_finite-state_machine","337094811_An_efficient_image_privacy_scheme_based_on_nonlinear_chaotic_system_and_linear_canonical_transformation","329664237_Image_privacy_scheme_using_quantum_spinning_and_rotation","329328972_On_Left_permutable_inverse_LA-semigroups","329048153_A_novel_image_encryption_scheme_based_on_quantum_dynamical_spinning_and_rotations","327472565_Information_Confidentiality_Using_Quantum_Spinning_Rotation_and_Finite_State_Machine","317724454_Rossler-based_chaotic_communication_system_implemented_on_FPGA"]}
