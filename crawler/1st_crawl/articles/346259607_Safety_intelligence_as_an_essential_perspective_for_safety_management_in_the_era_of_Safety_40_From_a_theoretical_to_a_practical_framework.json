{"id":"346259607_Safety_intelligence_as_an_essential_perspective_for_safety_management_in_the_era_of_Safety_40_From_a_theoretical_to_a_practical_framework","abstract":"In the age of big data, intelligence, and Industry 4.0, intelligence plays an increasingly significant role in management or, more specifically, decision making; thus, it becomes a popular topic and is recognised as an important discipline. Hence, safety intelligence (SI) as a new safety concept and term was proposed. SI aims to transform raw safety data and information into meaningful and actionable information for safety management; it is considered an essential perspective for safety management in the era of Safety 4.0 (computational safety scienceâ€”a new paradigm for safety science in the age of big data, intelligence, and Industry 4.0). However, thus far, no existing research provides a framework that comprehensively describes SI and guides the implementation of SI practices in organisations. To address this research gap and to provide a framework for SI and its practice in the context of safety management, based on a systematic and comprehensive explanation on SI from different perspectives, this study attempts to propose a theoretical framework for SI from a safety management perspective and then presents an SI practice model aimed at supporting safety management in organisations.","authors":["Bing Wang"],"meta":["April 2021Process Safety and Environmental Protection 148(2):189-199","DOI:10.1016/j.psep.2020.10.008"],"references":["319295134_Evidence-based_safety_EBS_management_A_new_approach_to_teaching_the_practice_of_safety_management_SM","272391250_Do_online_social_networks_support_decision-making","259090150_Business_intelligence_in_risk_management_Some_recent_progresses","345425647_Safety_intelligence_Incremental_proactive_risk_management_for_holistic_aviation_safety_performance","338138950_Safety_informatics_as_a_new_promising_and_sustainable_area_of_safety_science_in_the_information_age","337212193_A_comparative_analysis_of_safety_management_and_safety_performance_in_twelve_construction_projects","336817781_Improving_process_safety_What_roles_for_Digitalization_and_Industry_40","336180671_30_years_of_intelligence_models_in_management_and_business_A_bibliometric_review","336083452_Demystifying_safety-related_intelligence_in_safety_management_Some_key_questions_answered_from_a_theoretical_perspective","333503185_Deliberate_fires_From_data_to_intelligence","333331011_Challenges_opportunities_and_paradigm_of_applying_big_data_to_production_safety_management_From_a_theoretical_perspective","329538506_Role_of_Big_data_management_in_enhancing_big_data_decision-making_capability_and_quality_among_Chinese_firms_A_dynamic_capabilities_View","329081368_Using_data-driven_safety_decision-making_to_realize_smart_safety_management_in_the_era_of_big_data_A_theoretical_perspective_on_basic_questions_and_their_answers","328663233_Big-data-driven_safety_decision-making_A_conceptual_framework_and_its_influencing_factors","325289976_Making_the_Links_among_Environmental_Protection_Process_Safety_and_Industry_40","322009314_Safety_management_systems_A_broad_overview_of_the_literature","289455398_Competitive_analysis_and_strategic_decision-making_in_global_mining_firms","289455352_Government's_role_in_competitive_intelligence_What's_happening_in_Canada","271302690_Towards_a_universal_competitive_intelligence_process_model","259122975_Towards_an_implementation_framework_for_business_intelligence_in_healthcare","251615340_Exploring_the_information_literacy_of_professionals_in_safety_management","229587533_Safety_Management_in_Production","227827223_Knowledge_management_for_occupational_safety_Health_and_ergonomics","227445747_The_Decision_Making_Paradigm_of_Organization_Design","227416211_Competitive_Intelligence_Adds_Value","225847760_The_Ethics_of_Business_Intelligence","224010989_Theories_of_Decision-Making_in_Economics_and_Behavioral_Science","4882788_A_systems_approach_to_business_intelligence"]}
