{"id":"338727952_A_Mathematical_Theory_of_Cortex-Receptor_Artificial_Extension","abstract":"Many physiology experiments demonstrate that an organismâ€™s cortex and receptor system can be artificially extended, giving the organism new types of perceptual capabilities. To examine artificial extension of the cortex-receptor system, I propose a computational model that allows new types of sensory pathways to be added directly to the computational model itself in an online manner. A synapse expandable artificial neuron model that can grow new synapses, forming a bridge between the novel perceptual information and the existing neural network is introduced to absorb the novel sensory pathway. The experimental results show that the computational model can effectively integrate sudden emerged sensory channels and the neural circuits in the computational model can be reused for novel modalities without influencing the original modality.","authors":["You-Lu Xing"],"meta":["January 2020Scientific Reports 10(1):765","DOI:10.1038/s41598-020-57591-w"],"references":["236850664_Speech-Specific_Tuning_of_Neurons_in_Human_Superior_Temporal_Gyrus","221841409_Repetitive_motor_learning_induces_coordinated_formation_of_clustered_dendritic_spines_in_vivo","51696100_Active_tactile_exploration_using_a_brain-machine-brain_interface","327149793_Perception_Coordination_Network_A_Neuro_Framework_for_Multimodal_Concept_Acquisition_and_Binding","295893873_Embedding_a_Panoramic_Representation_of_Infrared_Light_in_the_Adult_Rat_Somatosensory_Cortex_through_a_Sensory_Neuroprosthesis","259989633_Phonetic_Feature_Encoding_in_Human_Superior_Temporal_Gyrus","235603848_Perceiving_Invisible_Light_through_a_Somatosensory_Cortical_Prosthesis","228114707_Concept_cells_the_building_blocks_of_declarative_memory_functions","225144510_A_Logical_Calculus_of_the_Idea_Immanent_in_Nervous_Activity","224982284_A_logical_Calculus_of_Ideas_Immanent_in_Nervous_Activity"]}
