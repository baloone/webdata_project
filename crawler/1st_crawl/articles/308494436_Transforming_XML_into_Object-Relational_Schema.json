{"id":"308494436_Transforming_XML_into_Object-Relational_Schema","abstract":"Abstract \n\nThe XML Schema Definition (XSD) describes with high precision, better than the Document Type Definition (DTD), the\nstructure and semantics of XML data. To translate the XSD schemas into database schemas as has been done for the\nDTD, the translation methodologies are needed. The object of this article is to present a method that makes it possible\nthe translation of an XSD schema into an object-relational database schema (ORS). To preserve the integrity constraints\ndefined in XSD such as type constraints, value constraints, and structure constraints during the process of translation,\nthe extended DTD (XDTD) schema is defined. The XDTD helps to represent the XML element in DTD with XSD constraints. \nIn this method, we introduce new specifications for XML, ORM and define the mapping from XSD into XDTD and XDTD\ninto ORS. These mappings allow an automated translation without human intervention.\n\nKeywords: XML, XSD, XDTD, Integrity Constraint, Object-Relational schema, Translation, Mapping.","authors":["Mustapha Machkour","Afdel Karim"],"meta":["May 2016IOSR Journal of Computer Engineering 18(05):40-52","DOI:10.9790/0661-1805014052","Project: model conversion"],"references":["228569161_Solving_Schema_Conversion_Problem_between_XML_and_Relational_Models_Semantic_Approach","3296158_The_Implementation_Of_Postgres","264922728_Fundamentals_of_Database_Systems","239985861_Extensible_Markup_Language_XML_W3C_Recommendation_REC-xml-19980210","237124259_Compilers_Principles","220587581_A_Translation_Algorithm_for_Effective_RDB-to-XML_Schema_Conversion_Considering_Referential_Integrity_Information","200034121_Advanced_SQL_1999---Understanding_Object-Relational_and_Other_Advanced_Features"]}
