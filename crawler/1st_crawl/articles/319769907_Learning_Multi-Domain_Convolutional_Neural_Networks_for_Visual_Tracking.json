{"id":"319769907_Learning_Multi-Domain_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_Visual_Tracking","abstract":"We propose a novel visual tracking algorithm based on the representations\nfrom a discriminatively trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Our\nalgorithm pretrains a CNN using a large set of videos with tracking\nground-truths to obtain a generic target representation. Our network is\ncomposed of shared layers and multiple branches of domain-specific layers,\nwhere domains correspond to individual training sequences and each branch is\nresponsible for binary classification to identify target in each domain. We\ntrain each domain in the network iteratively to obtain generic target\nrepresentations in the shared layers. When tracking a target in a new sequence,\nwe construct a new network by combining the shared layers in the pretrained CNN\nwith a new binary classification layer, which is updated online. Online\ntracking is performed by evaluating the candidate windows randomly sampled\naround the previous target state. The proposed algorithm illustrates\noutstanding performance in existing tracking benchmarks.","authors":["Hyeonseob Nam","Bohyung Han"],"meta":["October 2015"],"references":["307747289_Show_and_tell_A_neural_image_caption_generator","304604756_MUlti-Store_Tracker_MUSTer_a_Cognitive_Psychology_Inspired_Approach_to_Object_Tracking","319770430_Rich_feature_hierarchies_for_accurate_object_detection_and_semantic_segmentation","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","319770168_Fully_Convolutional_Networks_for_Semantic_Segmentation","313550366_Accurate_scale_estimation_for_robust_visual_tracking","312371270_Real-Time_Tracking_via_on-Line_Boosting","311610546_Image_Question_Answering_Using_Convolutional_Neural_Network_with_Dynamic_Parameter_Prediction","310752944_Frustratingly_easy_domain_adaptation","304417592_MatConvNet_convolutional_neural_networks_for_MATLAB"]}
