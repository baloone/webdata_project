{"id":"220520073_Data_Mining_for_Improved_Cardiac_Care","abstract":"Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) is the single largest killer in the world. Although, several CVD treatment guidelines have been developed to improve quality of care and reduce healthcare costs, for a number of reasons, adherence to these guidelines remains poor. Further, due to the extremely poor quality of data in medical patient records, most of todayâ€™s healthcare IT systems cannot provide significant support to improve the quality of CVD care (particularly in chronic CVD situations which contribute to the majority of costs). We present REMIND, a Probabilistic framework for Reliable Extraction and Meaningful Inference from Nonstructured Data. REMIND integrates the structured and unstructured clinical data in patient records to automatically create high-quality structured clinical data. There are two principal factors that enable REMIND to overcome the barriers associated with inference from medical","authors":["R.
