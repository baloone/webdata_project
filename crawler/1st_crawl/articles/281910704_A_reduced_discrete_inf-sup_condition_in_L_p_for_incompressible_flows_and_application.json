{"id":"281910704_A_reduced_discrete_inf-sup_condition_in_L_p_for_incompressible_flows_and_application","abstract":"In this work, we introduce a discrete specific inf-sup condition to estimate the Lp norm, 1 < p < +∞, of the pressure in a number of fluid flows. It applies to projection-based stabilized finite element discretizations of incompressible flows, typically when the velocity field has a low regularity. We derive two versions of this inf-sup condition: The first one holds on shape-regular meshes and the second one on quasi-uniform meshes. As an application, we derive reduced inf-sup conditions for the linearized Primitive equations of the Ocean that apply to the surface pressure in weighted Lp norm. This allows to prove the stability and convergence of quite general stabilized discretizations of these equations: SUPG, Least Squares, Adjoint-stabilized and OSS discretizations.","authors":["Tomás Chacón Rebollo","Vivette Girault","Macarena Gómez Mármol","Isabel Sánchez Muñoz"],"meta":["July 2015ESAIM Mathematical Modelling and Numerical Analysis 49(4):1219-1238","DOI:10.1051/m2an/2015008"],"references":["240949470_A_unified_convergence_analysis_for_local_projection_stabilisationsapplied_to_the_Oseen_problem","225478975_Continuous_interior_penalty_finite_element_method_for_the_time-dependent_Navier-Stokes_equations_Space_discretization_and_convergence","220577438_Local_projection_stabilization_of_equal_order_interpolation_applied_to_the_Stokes_problem","220179219_Continuous_Interior_Penalty_Finite_Element_Method_for_Oseen's_Equations","41700523_Chacon_Rebollo_T_An_analysis_technique_for_stabilized_finite_element_solution_of_incompressible_flows_M2AN_Math_Model_Numer_Anal_35_57-89","37445484_Local_Projection_Stabilization_for_the_Oseen_Problem_and_its_Interpretation_as_a_Variational_Multiscale_Method","321517017_Numerical_Methods_for_Singularly_Perturbed_Differential_Equations","318107835_Stabilized_finite_element_methods_for_the_generalized_Oseen_problem","267669688_Decomposition_of_vector_spaces_and_application_to_the_Stokes_problem_in_arbitrary_dimension","267433895_A_high_order_term-by-term_stabilization_solver_for_incompressible_flow_problems","267055159_Error_estimates_for_a_mixed_finite_element_approximation_of_the_Stokes_problem","257262756_An_intrinsic_analysis_of_existence_of_solutions_for_the_hydrostatic_approximation_of_Navier-Stokes_equations","244468180_Local_behavior_in_finite_element_methods","231744621_Analysis_of_the_hydrostatic_approximation_in_oceanography_with_compression_term","231111263_New_formulation_of_the_primitive_equations_of_atmosphere_and_applications","226488371_On_a_BPX-preconditioner_for_P1_elements","226008680_Finite_Element_Solution_of_the_Primitive_Equations_of_the_Ocean_by_the_Orthogonal_Sub-Scales_Method","223203770_Stabilized_finite_element_method_for_transient_Navier-Stokes_equations_based_on_pressure_gradient_projection","222934016_Interior_penalty_variational_multiscale_method_for_the_incompressible_Navier-Stokes_equation_Monitoring_artificial_dissipation","222734496_Stabilization_of_incompressibility_and_convection_through_orthogonal_sub-scales_in_finite_element_methods","220179018_A_Generalization_of_the_Local_Projection_Stabilization_for_Convection-Diffusion-Reaction_Equations","51992206_The_Mathematical_Theory_of_Finite_Element_Methods_Third_Edition","45065738_Two-grid_finite_element_schemes_for_the_transient_Navier-Stokes","31726552_The_Finite_Element_Method_for_Elliptic_Problems_PG_Ciarlet"]}
