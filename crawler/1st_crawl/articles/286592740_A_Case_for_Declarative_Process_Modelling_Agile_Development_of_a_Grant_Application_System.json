{"id":"286592740_A_Case_for_Declarative_Process_Modelling_Agile_Development_of_a_Grant_Application_System","abstract":"We report on a recent industrial project carried out by Exformatics A/S in which the company used the declarative DCR Graphs notation to model and implement the grant application process of a Danish foundation. We present the process and discuss the advantages of the approach and challenges faced both while modelling and implementing the process. Finally, we discuss current work on extensions to the DCR Graphs notation aiming to address the challenges raised by the case study and to support the declarative, agile approach.","authors":["SÃ¸ren Debois","Thomas Troels Hildebrandt","Tijs Slaats","Morten Marquard"],"meta":["September 2014","DOI:10.1109/EDOCW.2014.27","Conference: 2014 IEEE 18th International Enterprise Distributed Object Computing Conference Workshops and Demonstrations (EDOCW)","Project: Declarative Business Processes"],"references":["270578472_Hierarchical_Declarative_Modelling_with_Refinement_and_Sub-processes","262379110_A_Formal_Model_For_Declarative_Workflows_Dynamic_Condition_Response_Graphs","262312446_Declarative_Modeling-An_Academic_Dream_or_the_Future_for_BPM","261843648_Exformatics_Declarative_Case_Management_Workflows_as_DCR_Graphs","261236855_Towards_Trustworthy_Adaptive_Case_Management_with_Dynamic_Condition_Response_Graphs","229124837_Enabling_Flexibility_in_Process-Aware_Information_Systems_Challenges_Methods_Technologies","225371935_DecSerFlow_Towards_a_Truly_Declarative_Service_Flow_Language","220923553_Introducing_the_Guard-Stage-Milestone_Approach_for_Specifying_Business_Entity_Lifecycles","220791193_Safe_Distribution_of_Declarative_Processes","279371793_Enabling_Flexibility_in_Process-Aware_Information_Systems"]}
