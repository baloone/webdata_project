{"id":"326159293_Social_control_through_deterrence_on_the_compliance_with_information_security_policy","abstract":"Information system security (ISS) has become an extremely significant issue in organizations to protect information as an organizational asset. The purpose of this study is to investigate what factors affect individuals’ perception of sanction threats. This study uses social control theory to understand the effects of deterrence on public corporation employees’ ISS compliance and elucidate employees’ motivations of ISS violation and different perceptions of sanction threats. The effects and their significance in the model were tested. The results of this study help information security institutions to consider deterrence and self-punishment and to manage compliance with information security policy effectively and securely.","authors":["Myeonggil Choi","Jeongseok Song"],"meta":["October 2018Soft Computing 22(2)","DOI:10.1007/s00500-018-3354-z"],"references":["311766005_The_Partial_Least_Squares_Approach_to_Structural_Equation_Modeling","309045498_Information_security_policy_compliance_model_in_organisations","305042873_Leadership_of_Information_Security_Manager_on_the_Effectiveness_of_Information_Systems_Security_for_Secure_Sustainable_Computing","283549035_Information_security_policy_compliance_model_in_organizations","282395243_Information_Security_Management_as_a_Bridge_in_Cloud_Systems_from_Private_to_Public_Organizations","279978703_Conceptual_foundation_for_organizational_information_security_awareness","345069025_Substance_Use_by_Korean_Adolescents_A_Cross-Cultural_Test_of_Social_Learning_Social_Bonding_and_Self-Control_Theories","316417071_Crime_and_Punishment_An_Economic_Approach","311574068_Information_Systems_Security_and_the_Need_for_Policy","311261955_On_crimes_and_punishments_and_other_writings_Cambridge_texts_in_the_history_of_political_thought","279550478_Neutralization_New_Insights_into_the_Problem_of_Employee_Information_Systems_Security_Policy_Violations","275722837_The_Role_of_Extra-Role_Behaviors_and_Social_Controls_in_Information_Security_Policy_Effectiveness","273105215_How_to_manage_cloud_risks_based_on_the_BMIS_model","273262652_Work_Values_and_Job_Rewards_A_Theory_of_Job_Satisfaction","271799767_The_Rationality_of_Sexual_Offending_Testing_a_DeterrenceRational_Choice_Conception_of_Sexual_Assault"]}
