{"id":"301741531_Incorporating_service_and_user_information_and_latent_features_to_predict_QoS_for_selecting_and_recommending_cloud_service_compositions","abstract":"The rapid growth of published cloud services in the Internet makes the service selection and recommendation a challenging task for both users and service providers. In cloud environments, software re services collaborate with other complementary services to provide complete solutions to end users. The service selection is performed based on QoS requirements submitted by end users. Software providers alone cannot guarantee users’ QoS requirements. These requirements must be end-to-end, representing all collaborating services in a cloud solution. In this paper, we propose a prediction model to compute end-to-end QoS values for vertically composed services which are composed of three types of cloud services: software (SaaS), infrastructure (IaaS) and data (DaaS) services. These values can be used during the service selection and recommendation process. Our model exploits historical QoS values and cloud service and user information to predict unknown end-to-end QoS values of composite services. The experiments demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms other prediction models in terms of the prediction accuracy. We also study the impact of different parameters on the prediction results. In the experiments, we used real cloud services’ QoS data collected using our developed QoS monitoring and collecting system.","authors":["Raed Karim","Chen Ding","Ali Miri","Shahinur Rahman"],"meta":["September 2016Cluster Computing 19(3)","DOI:10.1007/s10586-016-0565-x"],"references":["308545687_End-to-End_Performance_Prediction_for_Selecting_Cloud_Services_Solutions","306014123_End-to-End_QoS_Prediction_of_Vertical_Service_Composition_in_the_Cloud","301412876_Incorporating_Invocation_Time_in_Predicting_Web_Service_QoS_via_Triadic_Factorization","290753594_Personalized_Location-Aware_QoS_Prediction_for_Web_Services_Using_Probabilistic_Matrix_Factorization","288319123_Location-Based_Hierarchical_Matrix_Factorization_for_Web_Service_Recommendation","281977540_A_Middleware_for_Managing_Non-Functional_Requirements_in_Cloud_PaaS","268751659_Efficient_web_service_QoS_prediction_using_local_neighborhood_matrix_factorization","261477730_Location-Aware_Collaborative_Filtering_for_QoS-Based_Service_Recommendation","261309296_An_Extended_Matrix_Factorization_Approach_for_QoS_Prediction_in_Service_Selection","261234820_Collaborative_Web_Service_QoS_Prediction_with_Location-Based_Regularization","260711914_Personalized_Web_Service_Recommendation_via_Normal_Recovery_Collaborative_Filtering","260652485_Predicting_Quality_of_Service_for_Selection_by_Neighborhood-Based_Collaborative_Filtering","260636768_Collaborative_Web_Service_QoS_Prediction_via_Neighborhood_Integrated_Matrix_Factorization","260357978_QoS_Ranking_Prediction_for_Cloud_Services","257013854_A_framework_for_ranking_of_cloud_computing_services"]}
