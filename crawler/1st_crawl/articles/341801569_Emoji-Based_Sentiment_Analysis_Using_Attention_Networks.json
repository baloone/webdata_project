{"id":"341801569_Emoji-Based_Sentiment_Analysis_Using_Attention_Networks","abstract":"Emojis are frequently used to express moods, emotions, and feelings in social media. There has been much research on emojis and sentiments. However, existing methods mainly face two limitations. First, they treat emojis as binary indicator features and rely on handcrafted features for emoji-based sentiment analysis. Second, they consider the sentiment of emojis and texts separately, not fully exploring the impact of emojis on the sentiment polarity of texts. In this article, we investigate a sentiment analysis model based on bidirectional long short-term memory, and the model has two advantages compared with the existing work. First, it does not need feature engineering. Second, it utilizes the attention approach to model the impact of emojis on text. An evaluation on 10,042 manually labeled Sina Weibo showed that our model achieves much better performance compared with several strong baselines. To facilitate the related research, our corpus will be publicly available at https://github.com/yx100/emoji.","authors":["Lou Yinxia","Yue Zhang","Fei Li","Tao Qian"],"meta":["June 2020ACM Transactions on Asian and Low-Resource Language Information Processing 19(5):1-13","DOI:10.1145/3389035"],"references":["334115435_Interpretable_Emoji_Prediction_via_Label-Wise_Attention_LSTMs","333831290_Exploiting_Emojis_for_Sarcasm_Detection","333061111_Emoji-Powered_Representation_Learning_for_Cross-Lingual_Sentiment_Classification","319879762_A_Cognition_Based_Attention_Model_for_Sentiment_Analysis","318740552_Facebook_sentiment_Reactions_and_Emojis","317013050_A_Multi-View_Sentiment_Corpus","316666447_Sentiment_analysis_using_product_review_data","314361240_Spice_up_Your_Chat_The_Intentions_and_Sentiment_Effects_of_Using_Emoji","311990867_Neural_Sentiment_Classification_with_User_and_Product_Attention","306093654_Improved_Representation_Learning_for_Question_Answer_Matching","305334406_SemEval-2016_Task_4_Sentiment_Analysis_in_Twitter","305334401_Hierarchical_Attention_Networks_for_Document_Classification","301446107_SemEval-2015_Task_10_Sentiment_Analysis_in_Twitter","282270290_Sentiment_of_Emojis","262154706_Exploiting_social_relations_for_sentiment_analysis_in_microblogging","228603465_The_Impact_of_Emoticons_on_Message_Interpretation_in_Computer-Mediated_Communication","13853244_Long_Short-term_Memory","326569880_Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis_via_Bi-sense_Emoji_Embedding_and_Attention-based_LSTM","325633270_Emojis-Based_Sentiment_Classification_of_Arabic_Microblogs_Using_Deep_Recurrent_Neural_Networks","324989976_Context-Augmented_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_Twitter_Sarcasm_Detection","322694910_Deep_Learning_for_Sentiment_Analysis_A_Survey","322588027_Recurrent_Attention_Network_on_Memory_for_Aspect_Sentiment_Analysis","321064187_Automatic_Construction_of_an_Emoji_Sentiment_Lexicon","318742479_Attention_Modeling_for_Targeted_Sentiment","311990308_Attention-based_LSTM_Network_for_Cross-Lingual_Sentiment_Classification","306093209_Text_Understanding_with_the_Attention_Sum_Reader_Network","301446024_Document_Modeling_with_Gated_Recurrent_Neural_Network_for_Sentiment_Classification","290592016_A_Depression_Detection_Model_Based_on_Sentiment_Analysis_in_Micro-blog_Social_Network","283103482_Microblog_Sentiment_Analysis_with_Emoticon_Space_Model","281145060_Effective_Approaches_to_Attention-based_Neural_Machine_Translation","269762971_Sentiment_Analysis_and_Opinion_Mining","265099725_The_Myth_of_Impoverished_Signal_Dispelling_the_Spoken-Language_Fallacy_for_Emoticons_in_Online_Communication","265052545_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_Sentence_Classification","228815250_Emotional_Expression_Online_Gender_Differences_in_Emoticon_Use","228523135_Twitter_sentiment_classification_using_distant_supervision","7647316_Framewise_phoneme_classification_with_bidirectional_LSTM_and_other_neural_network_architectures"]}
