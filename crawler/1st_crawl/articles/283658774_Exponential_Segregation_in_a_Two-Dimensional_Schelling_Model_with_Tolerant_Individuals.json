{"id":"283658774_Exponential_Segregation_in_a_Two-Dimensional_Schelling_Model_with_Tolerant_Individuals","abstract":"We prove that the two-dimensional Schelling segregation model yields\nmonochromatic regions of size exponential in the area of individuals'\nneighborhoods, provided that the tolerance parameter is a constant strictly\nless than 1/2 but sufficiently close to it. Our analysis makes use of a\nconnection with the first-passage percolation model from the theory of\nstochastic processes.","authors":["Nicole Immorlica","Bobby Kleinberg","Brendan Lucier","Morteza Zadomighaddam"],"meta":["November 2015","SourcearXiv"],"references":["275055053_From_randomness_to_order_unperturbed_Schelling_segregation_in_two_or_three_dimensions","235638674_Digital_Morphogenesis_via_Schelling_Segregation","225307835_Torpid_Mixing_of_Local_Markov_Chains_on_3-Colorings_of_the_DiscreteTorus","221966052_An_Analysis_of_One-Dimensional_Schelling_Segregation","221590699_Simple_deterministic_approximation_algorithms_for_counting_matchings","220853236_Threshold_Models_for_Competitive_Influence_in_Social_Networks","220617375_Strong_Spatial_Mixing_with_Fewer_Colors_for_Lattice_Graphs","220432474_A_New_Look_at_Survey_Propagation_and_Its_Generalizations","220138308_Constructive_Proofs_of_Concentration_Bounds","45894481_Critical_Ising_on_the_Square_Lattice_Mixes_in_Polynomial_Time","5516960_Understanding_the_Social_Context_of_the_Schelling_Segregation_Model","2123206_Counting_without_sampling_New_algorithms_for_enumeration_problems_using_statistical_physics","305881947_Unperturbed_Schelling_segregation_in_two_or_three_dimensions","303620052_Digital_Morphogenesis_via_Schelling_Segregation","289180754_Computational_Network_Science_An_Algorithmic_Approach","283912710_Clustering_and_Mixing_Times_for_Segregation_Models_on_Z_2","233764071_Phase_Coexistence_and_Slow_Mixing_for_the_Hard-Core_Model_on_Z2","230818214_Dynamic_Models_of_Segregation","228825332_The_formation_of_ghettos_as_a_local_interaction_phenomenon","228321114_A_Dynamic_Model_of_Residential_Segregation","228057731_A_Very_Simple_Algorithm_for_Estimating_the_Number_of_k-Colorings_of_a_Low-Degree_Graph","227516705_Mixing_in_time_and_space_for_lattice_spin_systems_A_combinatorial_view","222556948_Residential_Segregation_in_an_All-Integrationist_World","220853259_Competitive_Influence_Maximization_in_Social_Networks","220553572_Convergence_to_Equilibrium_in_Local_Interaction_Games","220327294_Individual_Strategy_and_Social_Structure_An_Evolutionary_Theory_of_Institutions","51949401_Competitive_Contagion_in_Networks","47791451_The_spread_of_innovations_in_social_networks","45920704_Computational_Transition_at_the_Uniqueness_Threshold","38362912_On_the_Speed_of_Convergence_in_First-Passage_Percolation","2281443_Randomized_Distributed_Edge_Coloring_Via_An_Extension_Of_The_Chernoff-Hoeffding_Bounds","1915177_Algorithmic_Barriers_from_Phase_Transitions"]}
