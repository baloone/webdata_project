{"id":"308599135_Efficient_Mining_of_High-Utility_Itemsets_Using_Multiple_Minimum_Utility_Thresholds","abstract":"In the field of data mining, the topic of high-utility itemset mining (HUIM) has recently gained a lot of attention from researchers as it takes many factors into account that are useful for decision-making by retail managers. In the past, many algorithms have been presented for HUIM but most of them suffer from the limitation of using a single minimum utility threshold to identify high-utility itemsets (HUIs). For real-life applications, finding itemsets using a single threshold is inadequate and unfair since each item is different. Hence, the diversity or importance of each item should be considered. This paper proposes a solution to this issue by defining the novel task of HUIM with multiple minimum utility thresholds (named as HUIM-MMU). This task lets users specify a different minimum utility threshold for each item to identify more useful and specific HUIs, which would generate more profits when compared to HUIs discovered based on a single minimum utility threshold. The HUI-MMU algorithm is designed to mine HUIs in a level-wise manner. The sorted downward closure (SDC) property and the least minimum utility (LMU) concept are developed to avoid a combinatorial explosion for identifying HUIs and to ensure the completeness and correctness of HUI-MMU for discovering HUIs. Meanwhile, two improved algorithms, namely HUI-MMUTID and HUI-MMUTE, are presented based on the TID-index and EUCP strategies. Those strategies can be used to speed up the mining performance to discover HUIs. Substantial experiments on both real-life and synthetic datasets show that the designed algorithms can efficiently and effectively discover the complete set of HUIs in databases by considering multiple minimum utility thresholds.","authors":["Chun-Wei Jerry Lin","Wensheng Gan","Philippe Fournier Viger","Tzung-Pei Hong"],"meta":["September 2016Knowledge-Based Systems 113","DOI:10.1016/j.knosys.2016.09.013","Project: UPM: utility-oriented pattern mining"],"references":["304338315_A_fast_maintenance_algorithm_of_the_discovered_high-utility_itemsets_with_transaction_deletion","303601300_More_Efficient_Algorithm_for_Mining_Frequent_Patterns_with_Multiple_Minimum_Supports","300141470_EFIM_A_Highly_Efficient_Algorithm_for_High-Utility_Itemset_Mining","296685965_Fast_algorithms_for_mining_high-utility_itemsets_with_various_discount_strategies","289367292_Efficient_Algorithms_for_Mining_High-Utility_Itemsets_in_Uncertain_Databases","279460551_Efficient_algorithms_for_mining_up-to-date_high-utility_patterns","278050113_A_fast_updated_algorithm_to_maintain_the_discovered_high-utility_itemsets_for_transaction_modification","263696687_FHM_Faster_High-Utility_Itemset_Mining_Using_Estimated_Utility_Co-occurrence_Pruning","262369808_Mining_high_utility_itemsets_without_candidate_generation","221653129_UP-Growth_An_efficient_algorithm_for_high_utility_itemset_mining","221103741_Novel_techniques_to_reduce_search_space_in_multiple_minimum_supports-based_frequent_pattern_mining_algorithms","221020150_Parallel_Method_for_Mining_High_Utility_Itemsets_from_Vertically_Partitioned_Distributed_Databases","220907052_CHARM_An_efficient_algorithm_for_Closed_Itemset_Mining","220906932_A_Foundational_Approach_to_Mining_Itemset_Utilities_from_Databases","220765979_Fast_and_Memory_Efficient_Mining_of_High_Utility_Itemsets_in_Data_Streams","3296625_Data_mining_An_overview_from_a_database_perspective","2270824_Mining_Association_Rules_with_Multiple_Minimum_Supports","286941932_Discovering_high_utility_itemsets_with_multiple_minimum_supports","278398856_Pruning_strategies_for_mining_high_utility_itemsets","278392315_Mining_top-k_high_utility_patterns_over_data_streams","271428711_Efficiently_Mining_Top-K_High_Utility_Sequential_Patterns","263578829_An_efficient_projection-based_indexing_approach_for_mining_high_utility_itemsets","261371353_Applying_the_maximum_utility_measure_in_high_utility_sequential_pattern_mining","261040777_Direct_Discovery_of_High_Utility_Itemsets_without_Candidate_Generation","260026660_High_utility_itemset_mining_with_techniques_for_reducing_overestimated_utilities_and_pruning_candidates","257404822_Utility-based_association_rule_mining_A_marketing_solution_for_cross-selling","256721121_Discovery_of_fuzzy_quantitative_sequential_patterns_with_multiple_minimum_supports_and_adjustable_membership_functions","254464338_USpan_An_efficient_algorithm_for_mining_high_utility_sequential_patterns","247323181_Quest_Synthetic_Data_Generator","236677129_Multiangle_combined_magnetic-field_annealing_of_Co-based_amorphous_microwires_for_sensor_applications","235949400_Efficient_Algorithms_for_Mining_High_Utility_Itemsets_from_Transactional_Databases","235691495_Mutation_Profile_of_the_MUT_Gene_in_Chinese_Methylmalonic_Aciduria_Patients","224384927_Efficient_Tree_Structures_for_High_Utility_Pattern_Mining_in_Incremental_Databases","222552897_Isolated_items_discarding_strategy_for_discovering_high_utility_itemsets","222041134_Mining_association_rules_with_multiple_minimum_supports_a_new_mining_algorithm_and_a_support_tuning_mechanism","221900765_Fast_Algorithms_for_Mining_Association_Rules_in_Large_Databases","220895396_A_Two-Phase_Algorithm_for_Fast_Discovery_of_High_Utility_Itemsets","220451837_Mining_Frequent_Patterns_without_Candidate_Generation_A_Frequent-Pattern_Tree_Approach","220218929_Discovery_of_high_utility_itemsets_from_on-shelf_time_periods_of_products","220218388_An_effective_tree_structure_for_mining_high_utility_itemsets","4262871_Mining_Fuzzy_Multiple-level_Association_Rules_under_Multiple_Minimum_Supports","4047490_Mining_high_utility_itemsets"]}
