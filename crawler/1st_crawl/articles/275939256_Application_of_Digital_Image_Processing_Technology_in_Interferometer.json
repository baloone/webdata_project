{"id":"275939256_Application_of_Digital_Image_Processing_Technology_in_Interferometer","abstract":"For the history of the development of digital image processing and the content of the involved. Departure from the point of view of the advantages and development trends of digital image processing technology, and digital image processing technology in the specific application of the interferometer made a certain degree of analysis. In this paper, digital image processing technology in wide range of applications and significance of the interferometer, made some research, expect these research and analysis, for development of digital image processing technology and its further development in the interferometer, to have certain reference and guidance significance.","authors":["Yu Shu Zhou","Geng Zhang","Jia Li"],"meta":["July 2013International Journal of Online Engineering (iJOE) 9(S6):65","DOI:10.3991/ijoe.v9iS6.2846"],"references":[]}
