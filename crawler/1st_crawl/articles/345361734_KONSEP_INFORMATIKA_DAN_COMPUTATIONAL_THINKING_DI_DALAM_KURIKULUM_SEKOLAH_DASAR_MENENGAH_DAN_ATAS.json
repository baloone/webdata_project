Informatics can be presented as a scientific discipline to understand technology in a way that is more deeply behind computer programs. With the introduction of informatics to schools is to prepare young people to become creators of information technology not just users of information technology. To achieve this, informatics concepts need to be introduced from basic education, high school, and high school.
