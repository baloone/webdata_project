{"id":"331409297_Unconditionally_secure_quantum_bit_commitment_based_on_the_uncertainty_principle","abstract":"Unconditionally secure quantum bit commitment (QBC) was considered impossible. But the no-go proofs are based on the Hughston-Jozsa-Wootters (HJW) theorem (a.k.a. the Uhlmann theorem). Recently, it was found that in high-dimensional systems, there exist some states which can display a chaos effect in quantum steering, so that the attack strategy based on the HJW theorem has to require the capability of discriminating quantum states with very subtle difference, to the extent that is not allowed by the uncertainty principle. With the help of this finding, here we propose a simple QBC protocol which manages to evade the no-go proofs. Â© 2019 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.
