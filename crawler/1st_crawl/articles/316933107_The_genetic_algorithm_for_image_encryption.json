{"id":"316933107_The_genetic_algorithm_for_image_encryption","abstract":"New image encryption genetic algorithm based on the dynamic chaos has been proposed and implemented as software. The resistance of the algorithm to various types of cryptographic attacks has been examined. The following quantitative parameters of algorithm stability have been determined: information entropy, correlation coefficients between adjacent pixels, number of pixels change rate (NPCR), and unified average changing intensity (UACI).
