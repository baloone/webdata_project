{"id":"335273602_Weighted_posets_Learning_surface_order_from_dependency_trees","abstract":"This paper presents a novel algorithm for generating a surface word order for a sentence given its dependency tree using a two-stage process. Using dependency-based word embeddings and a Graph Neural Network, the algorithm first learns how to rewrite a dependency tree as a partially ordered set (poset) with edge-weights representing dependency distance. The subsequent topological sort of this poset reflects a surface word order. The algorithm is evaluated against a naive baseline of average dependency distances across 14 languages, performing well in terms of rank correlation and resulting rate of projectivity based on Universal Dependencies corpora.","authors":["William Dyer"],"meta":["August 2019","DOI:10.18653/v1/W19-7807","Conference: 18th International Workshop on Treebanks and Linguistic TheoriesAt: Paris, France","Project: Integration cost, preferred constituent order, and efficiency"],"references":["334116316_The_First_Multilingual_Surface_Realisation_Shared_Task_SR'18_Overview_and_Evaluation_Results","327427828_Integration_complexity_and_the_order_of_cosisters","351390358_Word_Embeddings_What_Works_What_Doesn't_and_How_to_Tell_the_Difference_for_Applied_Research","334118238_Generating_High-Quality_Surface_Realizations_Using_Data_Augmentation_and_Factored_Sequence_Models","334117853_NILC-SWORNEMO_at_the_Surface_Realization_Shared_Task_Exploring_Syntax-Based_Word_Ordering_using_Neural_Models","334117234_The_OSU_Realizer_for_SRST_'18_Neural_Sequence-to-Sequence_Inflection_and_Incremental_Locality-Based_Linearization","334116030_The_DipInfo-UniTo_system_for_SRST_2018","334115810_BinLin_A_Simple_Method_of_Dependency_Tree_Linearization","329976142_Finding_Optimal_1-Endpoint-Crossing_Trees","329882562_On_the_order_of_demonstrative_numeral_adjective_and_noun"]}
