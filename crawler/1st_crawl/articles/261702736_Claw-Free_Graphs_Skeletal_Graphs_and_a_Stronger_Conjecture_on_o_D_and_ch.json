{"id":"261702736_Claw-Free_Graphs_Skeletal_Graphs_and_a_Stronger_Conjecture_on_o_D_and_ch","abstract":"The second author's (B.A.R.) ω, Δ, χ conjecture proposes that every graph satisfies . In this article, we prove that the conjecture holds for all claw-free graphs. Our approach uses the structure theorem of Chudnovsky and Seymour. Along the way, we discuss a stronger local conjecture, and prove that it holds for claw-free graphs with a three-colorable complement. To prove our results, we introduce a very useful χ-preserving reduction on homogeneous pairs of cliques, and thus restrict our view to so-called skeletal graphs.","authors":["Andrew D.
