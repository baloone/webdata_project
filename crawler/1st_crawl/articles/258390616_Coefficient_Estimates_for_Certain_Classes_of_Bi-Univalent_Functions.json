{"id":"258390616_Coefficient_Estimates_for_Certain_Classes_of_Bi-Univalent_Functions","abstract":"A function analytic in the open unit disk is said to be bi-univalent in if both the function\nand its inverse map are univalent there. The bi-univalency condition imposed\non the functions analytic in makes the behavior of their\ncoefficients unpredictable. Not much is known about the behavior of the\nhigher order coefficients of classes of bi-univalent functions. We use Faber\npolynomial expansions of bi-univalent functions to obtain estimates for\ntheir general coefficients subject to certain gap series as well as\nproviding bounds for early coefficients of such functions.","authors":["Jay Jahangiri","Samaneh G.
