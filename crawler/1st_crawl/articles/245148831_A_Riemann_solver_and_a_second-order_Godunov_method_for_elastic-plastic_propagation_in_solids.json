{"id":"245148831_A_Riemann_solver_and_a_second-order_Godunov_method_for_elastic-plastic_propagation_in_solids","abstract":"By use of three basic paths of elastic-plastic loading, a Riemann solver is established for the one-dimensional combined longitudinal and torsional stress wave problem of the thin-walled elastic-plastic tube. Based on this, a second-order Godunov method is developed for the numerical computation of elastic-plastic waves. Finally the numerical method is applied to some basic problems with known exact solutions and the comparison of results is made.","authors":["Xiao Lin"],"meta":["August 1993International Journal of Impact Engineering 13(3):463-478","DOI:10.1016/0734-743X(93)90118-Q"],"references":["285599602_Towards_the_Ultimate_Conservative_Difference_Scheme_V_A_Second-order_Sequel_to_Godunov's_Method","265948349_A_difference_method_for_plane_problems_in_dynamic_elasticity","316793214_Anwendungen_der_Methode_der_Randelemente_in_der_Elastodynamik_und_der_Fluiddynamik","304347495_A_finite_difference_method_for_the_numerical_computation_of_discontinuous_solutions_of_the_equations_of_fluid_dynamics","284154721_Dynamic_analysis_of_cracked_structures_using_singularity_finite_elements","266518198_Anwendungen_der_Methode_der_Randelemente_in_der_Elastodynamik_und_der_Fluiddynamik_Application_of_the_boundary_element_method_in_elasto-and_fluid_dynamics","253360512_Elastodynamics_of_Cracked_Structures_Using_Finite_Elements","252987172_Plastic_Wave_Propagation_in_Linearly_Work-Hardening_Materials","252123322_Biaxial_Plastic_Simple_Waves_With_Combined_Kinematic_and_Isotropic_Hardening","244448591_A_finite_difierence_method_for_the_computation_of_discontinuous_solutions_of_the_equations_of_fluid_dynamics"]}
