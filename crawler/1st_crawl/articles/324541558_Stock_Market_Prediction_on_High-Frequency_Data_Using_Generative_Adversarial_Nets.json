{"id":"324541558_Stock_Market_Prediction_on_High-Frequency_Data_Using_Generative_Adversarial_Nets","abstract":"Stock price prediction is an important issue in the financial world, as it contributes to the development of effective strategies for stock exchange transactions. In this paper, we propose a generic framework employing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural network (CNN) for adversarial training to forecast high-frequency stock market. This model takes the publicly available index provided by trading software as input to avoid complex financial theory research and difficult technical analysis, which provides the convenience for the ordinary trader of nonfinancial specialty. Our study simulates the trading mode of the actual trader and uses the method of rolling partition training set and testing set to analyze the effect of the model update cycle on the prediction performance. Extensive experiments show that our proposed approach can effectively improve stock price direction prediction accuracy and reduce forecast error.","authors":["Xingyu Zhou","Zhisong Pan","Guyu Hu","Siqi Tang"],"meta":["April 2018Mathematical Problems in Engineering 2018(1):1-11","DOI:10.1155/2018/4907423"],"references":["316373382_Deep_Learning_Networks_for_Stock_Market_Analysis_and_Prediction_Methodology_Data_Representations_and_Case_Studies","312037449_Price_Direction_Prediction_on_High_Frequency_Data_Using_Deep_Belief_Networks","309613685_Can_Online_Emotions_Predict_the_Stock_Market_in_China","305214717_High-Frequency_Trading_Strategy_Based_on_Deep_Neural_Networks","321529348_Time_Series_Analysis_and_Its_Applications_With_R_Examples","319770234_Deep_multi-scale_video_prediction_beyond_mean_square_error","318612826_Globally_and_locally_consistent_image_completion","313794385_Real-Time_Risk_What_Investors_Should_Know_About_FinTech_High-Frequency_Trading_and_Flash_Crashes","312519937_A_Double-Layer_Neural_Network_Framework_for_High-Frequency_Forecasting","309454208_High-frequency_stock_linkage_and_multi-dimensional_stationary_processes"]}
