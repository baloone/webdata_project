{"id":"223149024_On_monochromatic_paths_in_edge-coloured_digraphs","abstract":"Let G be a directed graph whose edges are coloured with two colours. Call a set S of vertices of Gindependent if no two vertices of S are connected by a monochromatic directed path. We prove that if G contains no monochromatic infinite outward path, then there is an independent set S of vertices of G such that, for every vertex x not in S, there is a monochromatic directed path from x to a vertex of S. In the event that G is infinite, the proof uses Zorn's lemma. The last part of the paper is concerned with the case when G is a tournament.","authors":["Bill Sands","Norbert Sauer","Robert Woodrow"],"meta":["December 1982Journal of Combinatorial Theory Series B 33(3):271-275","DOI:10.1016/0095-8956(82)90047-8","Sourcedx.doi.org"],"references":["243656757_On_dominance_relations_and_the_structure_of_animal_societies","226979706_Every_directed_graph_has_a_semi-kernel","225523122_On_dominance_relations_and_the_structure_of_animal_societies_III_The_condition_for_a_score_structure"]}
