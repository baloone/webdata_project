{"id":"331540337_Breaking_an_Image_Encryption_Algorithm_Based_on_DNA_Encoding_and_Spatiotemporal_Chaos","abstract":"Recently, an image encryption algorithm based on DNA encoding and spatiotemporal chaos (IEA-DESC) was proposed. In IEA-DESC, pixel diffusion, DNA encoding, DNA-base permutation and DNA decoding are performed successively to generate cipher-images from the plain-images. Some security analyses and simulation results are given to prove that it can withstand various common attacks. However, in this paper, it is found that IEA-DESC has some inherent security defects as follows: (1) the pixel diffusion is invalid for attackers from the perspective of cryptanalysis; (2) the combination of DNA encoding and DNA decoding is equivalent to bitwise complement; (3) the DNA-base permutation is actually a fixed position shuffling operation for quaternary elements, which has been proved to be insecure. In summary, IEA-DESC is essentially a combination of a fixed DNA-base position permutation and bitwise complement. Therefore, IEA-DESC can be equivalently represented as simplified form, and its security solely depends on the equivalent secret key. So the equivalent secret key of IEA-DESC can be recovered using chosen-plaintext attack and chosen-ciphertext attack, respectively. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the two attack methods are both effective and efficient.","authors":["Heping Wen","Simin Yu","Jinhu LÃ¼"],"meta":["March 2019Entropy 21(3):246","DOI:10.3390/e21030246"],"references":["330497777_Cryptanalysis_and_Improvement_of_the_Hyper-Chaotic_Image_Encryption_Scheme_Based_on_DNA_Encoding_and_Scrambling","330312314_An_Algorithm_of_Image_Encryption_Using_Logistic_and_Two-Dimensional_Chaotic_Economic_Maps","328752331_Improved_Cryptanalysis_and_Enhancements_of_an_Image_Encryption_Scheme_Using_Combined_1D_Chaotic_Maps","328355081_Encryption_Algorithm_of_Multiple-Image_Using_Mixed_Image_Elements_and_Two_Dimensional_Chaotic_Economic_Map","327795760_A_color_image_cryptosystem_based_on_dynamic_DNA_encryption_and_chaos","323888791_A_Novel_Hyperchaotic_Image_Encryption_Scheme_Based_on_DNA_Encoding_Pixel-Level_Scrambling_and_Bit-Level_Scrambling","330446810_A_novel_control_method_to_counteract_the_dynamical_degradation_of_a_digital_chaotic_sequence","330151703_Dynamic_Analysis_of_Digital_Chaotic_Maps_via_State-Mapping_Networks","326442984_Cryptanalysis_of_a_Chaotic_Stream_Cipher_and_Its_Improved_Scheme","324055616_Cryptanalysis_of_a_Chaotic_Image_Encryption_Algorithm_Based_on_Information_Entropy","322525001_Brief_review_on_application_of_nonlinear_dynamics_in_image_encryption","322752127_Encryption_algorithm_based_on_Hadoop_and_non-degenerate_high-dimensional_discrete_hyperchaotic_system","320890967_Cryptanalyzing_an_Image_Encryption_Algorithm_Based_on_Autoblocking_and_Electrocardiography","320218041_A_novel_color_image_encryption_scheme_using_fractional-order_hyperchaotic_system_and_DNA_sequence_operations","318980950_Cryptanalysis_of_a_DNA_and_chaos_based_image_encryption_algorithm"]}
