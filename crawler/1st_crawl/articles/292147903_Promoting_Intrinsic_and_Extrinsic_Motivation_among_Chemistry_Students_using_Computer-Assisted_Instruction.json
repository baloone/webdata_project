The study employed two modes of computer-assisted instruction (computer simulation instruction and computer tutorial instructional packages) and two levels of gender (male and female) using pretest-posttest experimental group design. Ninety (45 males and 45 females) senior secondary one (SS1) students from three secondary schools in Minna, Nigeria, made up the sample. The schools were purposively sampled and randomly assigned to experimental and control groups. The Experimental Group I was taught two selected concepts of chemistry using computer simulation instructional package (CSIP), Experimental Group II was exposed to computer tutorial Instructional package (CTIP) while conventional teaching method (CTM) was used for the Control Group. Validated Chemistry Achievement Test (CAT) and Chemistry Motivation Questionnaire (CMQ) with reliability coefficient of 0.89 and 0.94 respectively were used for data collection. Classroom observations as well as interview schedules were also conducted. Data from CAT and CTM were analyzed using One-way ANOVA and Scheffe's post-hoc test, while the data from the classroom observations and interview schedules were thematically analyzed. The outcome of this study revealed that students taught with CSIP performed better than those in CTIP and CTM groups. The CSIP and CTIP were found also to be gender friendly. Moreover, students taught with CSIP had higher intrinsic and extrinsic motivation than their counterparts in CTIP and CTM respectively. Based on the findings, it was recommended that chemistry teachers should employ computer simulation for improving their students' performance and motivation in the subject.","authors":["Isiaka Gamabri","Bimpe E Gbodi","Eyitao U Olakanmi"],"meta":["March 2016Contemporary Educational Technology 7(71):25-46","DOI:10.30935/cedtech/6161"],"references":["277225174_The_Influence_of_computer_assisted_instruction_CAI_in_chemistry_on_the_Students'_Achievement_at_higher_secondary_level_in_Bahawalpur","275965167_Improving_Secondary_School_Students'_Achievement_and_Retention_in_Biology_Through_Video-Based_Multimedia_Instruction","275518090_EFFECT_OF_VIRTUAL_LABORATORY_STRATEGY_ON_THE_ACHIEVEMENT_OF_SECONDARY_SCHOOL_STUDENTS_IN_PHYSICS_PRACTICAL_IN_MINNA_NIGERIA","267850957_Evaluating_the_effect_of_computer_simulations_on_secondary_biology_instruction_An_application_of_Bloom's_taxonomy","289963904_Intrinsic_and_extrinsic_motivations_Classic_definitions_and_new_directions","289963001_Intrinsic_and_Extrinsic_Motivations_Classic_Definition_and_New_Directions","266491357_Using_computer_in_science_class_The_interactive_effect_of_gender","255567301_Using_a_Computer_Simulation_Before_Dissection_to_Help_Students_Learn_Anatomy","248998969_Interactive_or_inactive_A_consideration_of_the_nature_of_interaction_in_whole_class_teaching","248261265_Using_Computer_Animated_Graphics_in_Science_Instruction_With_Children"]}
