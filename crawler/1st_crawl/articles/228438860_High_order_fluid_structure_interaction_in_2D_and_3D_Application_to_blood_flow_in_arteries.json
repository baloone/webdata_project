{"id":"228438860_High_order_fluid_structure_interaction_in_2D_and_3D_Application_to_blood_flow_in_arteries","abstract":"Accuracy is critical if we are to trust the simulation's predictions. In settings such as fluid-structure interaction it is all the more important to obtain reliable results to understand, for example, the impact of pathologies on blood flows in the cardiovascular system. In [1] we have proposed a framework for high order (in space and time) fluid structure interaction in 2D using an efficient high order ALE map construction which is described in [2]. In the first part of the paper, we propose a new high order ALE construction which allows for any type — not only vertical as in [2] — of not too large displacements that applies to 2D as well as 3D. This construction relies on a first order approximation and a correction step that recovers the high order accuracy. In the second part of the paper we present an update of our fluid-structure interaction framework.","authors":["Vincent Chabannes","Gonçalo Pena","Christophe Prud'homme"],"meta":["November 2013Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics 246","DOI:10.1016/j.cam.2012.10.006"],"references":["278644765_Towards_Blood_Flow_Simulation","266603022_Simulation_of_two_phase_flow_using_a_level_set_method_Application_to_bubbles_and_vesicle_dynamics","236866551_Fluid-structure_interaction_using_a_partitioned_semi-implicit_predictor-corrector_coupling_scheme_for_the_application_of_large-eddy_simulation","233910882_Feel_A_Computational_Framework_for_Galerkin_Methods_and_Advanced_Numerical_Methods","227629121_Gmsh_A_3-D_Finite_Element_Mesh_Generator_with_Built-in_Pre-_and_Post-Processing_Facilities","227260430_Numerical_Simulation_and_Benchmarking_of_a_Monolithic_Multigrid_Solver_for_Fluid-Structure_Interaction_Problems_with_Application_to_Hemodynamics","226447172_Proposal_for_Numerical_Benchmarking_of_Fluid-Structure_Interaction_Between_an_Elastic_Object_and_Laminar_Incompressible_Flow","225220311_Life_Overview_of_a_Unified_C_Implementation_of_the_Finite_and_Spectral_Element_Methods_in_1D_2D_and_3D","220840292_Life_Overview_of_a_Unified_C_Implementation_of_the_Finite_and_Spectral_Element_Methods_in_1D_2D_and_3D","220060987_A_Domain_Specific_Embedded_Language_in_C_for_Automatic_Differentiation_Projection_Integration_and_Variational_Formulations","40755047_Spectral_element_approximation_of_the_incompressible_Navier-Stokes_equations_in_a_moving_domain_and_applications","246333216_Gmsh_A_three-dimensional_finite_element_mesh_generator_with_built-in_pre-and_post-processing_facilities","242442800_Construction_of_Curvilinear_Co-Ordinate_Systems_and_Applications_to_Mesh_Generation","234653570_Cardiovascular_Mathematics_Modeling_and_Simulation_of_the_Circulatory_System","232380588_High_order_methods_for_the_approximation_of_the_incompressible_Navier-Stokes_equations_in_a_moving_domain","229705619_A_variable_diffusion_method_for_mesh_smoothing","228007711_Quantitative_benchmark_computations_of_two-dimensional_bubble_dynamics","227770310_A_3D_adaptive_mesh_moving_scheme","227109064_Numerical_Simulation_of_Fluid-Structure_Interaction_Using_Eddy-Resolving_Schemes","226519650_Transfinite_element_methods_Blending-function_interpolation_over_arbitrary_curved_element_domains","222448768_Numerical_Solution_of_the_Quasilinear_Poisson_Equation_in_a_Nonuniform_Triangle_Mesh","222398616_Construction_of_a_High_Order_Fluid-Structure_Interaction_Solver","51991782_Modern_Software_Tools_in_Scientific_Computing","49288658_Effiziente_Algorithmen_zur_partitionierten_Losung_stark_gekoppelter_Probleme_der_Fluid-Struktur-Wechselwirkung","37413198_Numerical_Approximation_of_Fluid-Structure_Interaction_Problems_with_Applications_to_Haemodynamics","2814913_Efficient_Management_of_Parallelism_in_Object-Oriented_Numerical_Software_Libraries"]}
