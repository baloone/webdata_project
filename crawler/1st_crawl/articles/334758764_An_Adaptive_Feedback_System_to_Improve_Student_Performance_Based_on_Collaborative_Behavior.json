{"id":"334758764_An_Adaptive_Feedback_System_to_Improve_Student_Performance_Based_on_Collaborative_Behavior","abstract":"With advancements in educational technologies, e-learning platforms have evolved to provide learning environments to the privileged and under-privileged population so that they can learn at their own pace. The success of these systems relies on engaging experience and timely and accurate feedback to the students on their performance. Still, these systems suffer from high student dropouts, often due to a lack of personalization in student interactions. While students show different collaborative behavior, i.e., some students are social, and like discussions, while others are self-oriented and donâ€™t participate in any collaborative activity, the feedback and interactions with students are generally not customized based on their type of collaborative behavior. This research aims to develop a method that provides adaptive feedback to each student according to their type of collaborative behavior and preferred gamification elements. Two experiments were performed to evaluate the system, and the results show that the system, with adaptive feedback, significantly improved student performance.","authors":["Muhammad Awais","Ume Habiba","Hina Khalid","Muhammad Shoaib"],"meta":["July 2019IEEE Access PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2931565"],"references":["327243016_Evaluation_of_an_adaptive_tutorial_supporting_the_teaching_of_mathematics","326913174_Adaptive_quizzes_to_increase_motivation_engagement_and_learning_outcomes_in_a_first_year_accounting_unit","325704013_OntoPeFeGe_Ontology-Based_Personalized_Feedback_Generator","319277786_Adaptive_feedback_in_computer-based_learning_environments_a_review","317608710_Animated_Pedagogical_Agents_to_Assist_Learners_and_to_keep_them_motivated_on_Online_Learning_Environments_LMS_or_MOOC","316147770_Collaborative_Learning_and_Critical_Thinking_Testing_the_Link","318304934_Learners'_perceptions_of_instructor_feedback_in_e-learning_courses_-_findings_from_HBMSU_United_Arab_Emirates","315886052_High-structure_versus_low-structure_cooperative_learning_in_introductory_psychology_classes_for_student_teachers_Effects_on_conceptual_knowledge_self-perceived_competence_and_subjective_task_values","312235234_Feedback_visualization_in_a_grammar-based_e-learning_system_for_German_a_preliminary_user_evaluation_with_the_COMPASS_system","311316388_Evaluating_Student_and_Instructor_Use_of_Video_Feedback_in_an_Online_Learning_Environment","281273095_Examining_the_Relations_among_Student_Motivation_Engagement_and_Retention_in_a_MOOC_A_Structural_Equation_Modeling_Approach","274731676_Will_MOOCs_transform_learning_and_teaching_in_higher_education_Engagement_and_course_retention_in_online_learning_provision","273777526_Massive_Open_Online_Courses_-_An_Adaptive_Learning_Framework","271275134_Structured_and_unstructured_discussion_forums_as_tools_for_student_engagement","267572644_The_evaluation_of_different_gaming_modes_and_feedback_types_on_game-based_formative_assessment_in_an_online_learning_environment"]}
