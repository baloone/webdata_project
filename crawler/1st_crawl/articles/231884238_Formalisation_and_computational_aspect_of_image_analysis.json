{"id":"231884238_Formalisation_and_computational_aspect_of_image_analysis","abstract":"In this article we shall present a unified and axiomatized view of several theories and algorithms of image multiscale analysis (and low level vision) which have been developed in the past twenty years. We shall show that under reasonable invariance and assumptions, all image (and shape) analyses can be reduced to a single partial differential equation. In the same way, movie analysis leads to a single parabolic differential equation. We discuss some applications to image segmentation and movie restoration. The experiments show how accurate and invariant the numerical schemes must be and we compare several (old and new) algorithms by discussing how well they match the axiomatic invariance requirements.","authors":["Luis Alvarez","Jean-Michel Morel"],"meta":["January 1994Acta Numerica 3:1 - 59","DOI:10.1017/S0962492900002415"],"references":["313208541_Boundary_detection_by_minimizing_functionals","311533101_Convergence_of_approximation_schemes_for_fully_nonlinear_second_order_equations","304909674_The_heat_equation_shrinks_embedded_plane_curves_to_round_points","280292894_General_Intensity_Transformations_and_Second_Order_Invariants","266431680_Level_sets_and_motion_by_mean_curvature","265502412_Une_approche_variationnelle_en_traitement_d'images_Resultats_d'existence_et_d'approximation_Variational_approach_in_image_processing_Existence_and_approximation_properties","264377242_Human_Factors_and_Behavioral_Science_Textons_The_Fundamental_Elements_in_Preattentive_Vision_and_Perception_of_Textures","253013398_Tutorial_On_Advances_In_Morphological_Image_Processing_And_Analysis","247471483_Segmentation_d''images_par_m'_ethode_variationnelle_Une_preuve_constructive_d''existence","247471268_Segmentation_by_minimizing_a_functional_and_the_merging_methods"]}
