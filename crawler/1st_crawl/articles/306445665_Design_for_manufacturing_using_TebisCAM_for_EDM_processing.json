{"id":"306445665_Design_for_manufacturing_using_TebisCAM_for_EDM_processing","abstract":"Using computer software to manufacture products is commonly referred to as computer aided manufacturing\n(CAM). CAM software generates toolpaths from a design model in order to give the computer guided machine\ninstructions on how to process the material into a finished product. In this paper we discus design approaches and the optimization of the design process using TebisCAM in EDM processing. The EDM process efficiency and reliability are improved through advanced control techniques and the use of new materials.\n\nHow to cite this article:\nDašić, P.; Badiu, I.; Popa, M. and Popescu, L.: Design for manufacturing using TebisCAM for EDM processing.
