{"id":"239577133_Human_Speech_Production_Mechanisms","abstract":"We use language every day without devoting much thought to the process, but articulatory move- ment—the movement of the lips, tongue, and other organs—is among the subtlest and most adept of any actions performed by human beings. Here, I discuss the mechanisms of speech production, introduce functions for producing sound by controlling the movement of vocal organs, and consider models for achieving speech functions that will enable a computer to mimic a voice that it hears.","authors":["Masaaki Honda"],"meta":["May 2003"],"references":["260919941_A_model_of_articulator_trajectory_formation_based_on_the_motor_tasks_of_vocal-tract_shapes","240011269_Fundamentals_of_speech_signal_processing","229100481_Fundamentals_of_Speech_Processing","221486045_Determination_of_articulatory_positions_from_speech_acoustics_by_applying_dynamic_articulatory_constraints"]}
