{"id":"222850848_Parallel_program_schemata","abstract":"This paper introduces a model called the parallel program schema for the representation and study of programs containing parallel sequencing. The model is related to Ianov's program schema, but extends it, both by modelling memory structure in more detail and by admitting parallel computation. The emphasis is on decision procedures, both for traditional properties, such as equivalence, and for new properties particular to parallel computation, such as determinacy and boundedness.","authors":["Richard M.
