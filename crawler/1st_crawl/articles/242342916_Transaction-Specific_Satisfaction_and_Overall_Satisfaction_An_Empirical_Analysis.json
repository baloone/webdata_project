{"id":"242342916_Transaction-Specific_Satisfaction_and_Overall_Satisfaction_An_Empirical_Analysis","abstract":"The distinction between transaction-specific satisfaction and overall satisfaction has received little empirical attention in the satisfaction and services literature. Furthermore, a review of the extant literature provides mixed conceptual evidence concerning the relationships among transaction-specific satisfaction, overall satisfaction, and repurchase intentions. This study empirically investigates transaction-specific satisfaction, overall satisfaction and repurchase intentions, and finds that the two types of satisfaction can be distinguished from one another. Furthermore, the findings from this study suggest that overall satisfaction has a direct influence on repurchase intentions as well as a moderating influence on the transaction-specific satisfaction/repurchase intentions relationship. When overall satisfaction is high, transaction-specific satisfaction has little impact on repurchase intentions, but when overall satisfaction is low, transaction-specific satisfaction has a positive influence on repurchase intentions.","authors":["Michael A.
