{"id":"352956862_Knowledge_Graphs","abstract":"In this article, we provide a comprehensive introduction to knowledge graphs, which have recently garnered significant attention from both industry and academia in scenarios that require exploiting diverse, dynamic, large-scale collections of data. After some opening remarks, we motivate and contrast various graph-based data models, as well as languages used to query and validate knowledge graphs. We explain how knowledge can be represented and extracted using a combination of deductive and inductive techniques. We conclude with high-level future research directions for knowledge graphs.","authors":["Aidan Hogan","Eva Blomqvist","Michael Cochez","Claudia dâ€™Amato"],"meta":["July 2021ACM Computing Surveys 54(4):1-37","DOI:10.1145/3447772"],"references":["351115157_A_Survey_on_Knowledge_Graphs_Representation_Acquisition_and_Applications","347702769_Knowledge_Graph_OLAP_A_multidimensional_model_and_query_operations_for_contextualized_knowledge_graphs","346929097_LaraDB_A_Minimalist_Kernel_for_Linear_and_Relational_Algebra_Computation","346299184_Knowledge_Graphs_Research_Directions","345657888_Industry-scale_Knowledge_Graphs_Lessons_and_Challenges_Five_diverse_technology_companies_show_how_it's_done","345489153_Domain-Specific_Knowledge_Graph_Construction","345426495_Knowledge_Graphs_and_Enterprise_AI_The_Promise_of_an_Enabling_Technology","345426291_Building_a_Broad_Knowledge_Graph_for_Products","340573304_Dynamic_Heterogeneous_Graph_Embedding_Using_Hierarchical_Attentions","340145429_A_Comprehensive_Survey_on_Graph_Neural_Networks","339282342_Named_Entity_Extraction_for_Knowledge_Graphs_A_Literature_Overview","338943166_Knowledge_Graphs_Methodology_Tools_and_Selected_Use_Cases","336996197_TuckER_Tensor_Factorization_for_Knowledge_Graph_Completion","336601814_Use_of_OWL_and_Semantic_Web_Technologies_at_Pinterest","336601641_Unsupervised_Discovery_of_Corroborative_Paths_for_Fact_Validation"]}
