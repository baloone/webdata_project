{"id":"254329803_Response_Surface_Alternatives_to_the_Taguchi_Robust_Parameter_Design_Approach","abstract":"This department publishes articles of interest to statistical practitioners. Innovative applications of known methodology may be suitable, but sizable case studies should be submitted to other journals. Brief descriptions and illustrations of new developments that are potentially useful in statistical practice are appropriate. Acceptable articles should appeal to a substantial number of practitioners.In the decade of the 1980s much attention was given to the data and analytic and experimental design efforts of Genichi Taguchi. Methodology advocated by Taguchi, often called robust parameter design, gained the interest of practitioners working in industry in quality improvement. Many statisticians in the West have pointed out apparent flaws in the Taguchi approach. As the controversy surrounding Taguchi matures, several investigators have embraced important aspects of parameter design and the result is a collection of alternatives to the Taguchi approach. Some of these alternatives highlight the use of response surface procedures where mean and variance modeling are considered simultaneously.","authors":["Raymond H.
