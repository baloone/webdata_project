{"id":"320405643_Approximability_and_inapproximability_of_the_star_p_-hub_center_problem_with_parameterized_triangle_inequality","abstract":"A complete weighted graph G=(V,E,w) is called Δβ-metric, for some β≥1/2, if G satisfies the β-triangle inequality, i.e., w(u,v)≤β⋅(w(u,x)+w(x,v)) for all vertices u,v,x∈V. Given a Δβ-metric graph G=(V,E,w) and a center c∈V, and an integer p, the Δβ-Star p-Hub Center problem (Δβ-SpHCP) is to find a depth-2 spanning tree T of G rooted at c such that c has exactly p children (also called hubs) and the diameter of T is minimized. In this paper, we study Δβ-SpHCP for all β≥12. We show that for any ϵ>0, to approximate the Δβ-SpHCP to a ratio g(β)−ϵ is NP-hard and give r(β)-approximation algorithms for the same problem where g(β) and r(β) are functions of β. A subclass of metric graphs is identified that Δβ-SpHCP is polynomial-time solvable. Moreover, some r(β)-approximation algorithms given in this paper meet approximation lower bounds.","authors":["Li-Hsuan Chen","Dun-Wei Cheng","Sun-Yuan Hsieh","Ling-Ju Hung"],"meta":["October 2017Journal of Computer and System Sciences 92","DOI:10.1016/j.jcss.2017.09.012"],"references":["276584763_A_general_variable_neighborhood_search_for_solving_the_uncapacitated_r-allocation_p-hub_median_problem"]}
