{"id":"320941856_Nonlinear_coupling_induced_toroidal_structure_of_edge_localized_modes","abstract":"Edge localized modes (ELMs) are magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instabilities that cause fast periodic relaxations of the strong edge pressure gradient in tokamak fusion plasmas. A novel diagnostic method allows the extraction of toroidal mode numbers, rotation velocities and spatial information during the ELM cycle including the crash. While mode number branches n = 3-6 and n = 8-10 are dominant just before the ELM crash, during the ELM crash n = 2-5 are observed in typical discharges with type-I ELMs in the tokamak experiment. These findings are compared to results from nonlinear MHD simulations. Although n = 6 is linearly dominant, nonlinear coupling in which n = 1 is particularly important leads to the dominance of n = 3-5 during the ELM crash, in excellent agreement with experimental observations. The simultaneous occurrence of these modes over a wide radial region leads to high stochasticity and thus increased transport.","authors":["Alexander Felician Mink","Matthias Hoelzl","Elisabeth Wolfrum","Francois Orain"],"meta":["November 2017Nuclear Fusion 58(2)","DOI:10.1088/1741-4326/aa98f7"],"references":["315631129_Solitary_perturbations_in_the_steep_boundary_of_magnetized_toroidal_plasma","259312996_Current_understanding_of_the_processes_underlying_the_triggering_of_and_energy_loss_associated_with_type_I_ELMs","258264232_Non-linear_magnetic_perturbations_during_edge-localized_modes_in_TCV_dominated_by_low_n_mode_components","255796454_Reduced-magnetohydrodynamic_simulations_of_toroidally_and_poloidally_localized_edge_localized_modes","236844106_Nonlinear_excitation_of_low-n_harmonics_in_reduced_magnetohydrodynamic_simulations_of_edge-localized_modes","231130851_Explosive_instabilities_From_solar_flares_to_edge_localized_modes_in_tokamaks","231081673_2D_ECE_measurements_of_type-I_edge_localized_modes_at_ASDEX_Upgrade","231053574_MHD_stability_in_X-point_geometry_Simulation_of_ELMs","230962334_On_the_relationship_between_ELM_filaments_and_solar_flares","49751626_Nonlinear_Simulations_of_Peeling-Ballooning_Modes_with_Anomalous_Electron_Viscosity_and_their_Role_in_Edge_Localized_Mode_Crashes","30047807_Type-I_ELM_precursor_modes_in_JET","28620985_Beta_limits_in_long-pulse_tokamak_discharges","7070115_Evolution_of_Filament_Structures_during_Edge-Localized_Modes_in_the_MAST_Tokamak","321612309_Modal_Analysis_of_Nonlinear_Mechanical_Systems","317780805_Pedestal_and_Er_profile_evolution_during_an_edge_localized_mode_cycle_at_ASDEX_Upgrade","316308687_Recent_progress_in_the_quantitative_validation_of_JOREK_simulations_of_ELMs_in_JET","309686964_Toroidal_mode_number_determination_of_ELM_associated_phenomena_on_ASDEX_Upgrade","303321153_High_frequency_magnetic_fluctuations_correlated_with_the_inter-ELM_pedestal_evolution_in_ASDEX_Upgrade","301665767_Edge_localized_mode_rotation_and_the_nonlinear_dynamics_of_filaments","277896567_Correlations_between_quasi-coherent_fluctuations_and_the_pedestal_evolution_during_the_inter-edge_localized_modes_phase_on_DIII-D","273429184_Velocimetry_analysis_of_type-I_edge_localized_mode_precursors_in_ASDEX_Upgrade","273407085_Estimation_of_edge_electron_temperature_profiles_via_forward_modelling_of_the_electron_cyclotron_radiation_transport_at_ASDEX_Upgrade","272076812_Resistive_Reduced_MHD_Modeling_of_Multi-Edge-Localized-Mode_Cycles_in_Tokamak_X_-Point_Plasmas","263018014_Phase_Dynamics_Criterion_for_Fast_Relaxation_of_High-Confinement-Mode_Plasmas","259661731_Non-linear_MHD_modeling_of_plasma_response_to_Resonant_Magnetic_Perturbations","253469218_Primary_edge_localized_mode_filament_structure_in_the_National_Spherical_Torus_Experiment","252458949_REVIEW_ARTICLE_Physics_of_collapse_events_in_toroidal_plasmas","243695485_Transport_Phenomena_in_a_Completely_Ionized_Gas","238976729_Indications_of_Strongly_Flux-Limited_Electron_Thermal_Conduction_in_Laser-Target_Experiments","234998232_Analytical_solutions_to_the_Grad-Shafranov_equation_for_tokamak_equilibrium_with_dissimilar_source_functions","234974575_Fast_imaging_of_edge_localized_mode_structure_and_dynamics_in_DIII-D","234961968_Development_and_validation_of_a_predictive_model_for_the_pedestal_height","234943458_Characterization_of_pedestal_parameters_and_edge_localized_mode_energy_losses_in_the_Joint_European_Torus_and_predictions_for_the_International_Thermonuclear_Experimental_Reactor","234897094_Magnetohydrodynamic_stability_of_tokamak_edge_plasmas","231142067_Edge_localized_modes_ELMs","231011944_H-mode_pedestal_ELM_and_power_threshold_studies_in_NSTX","230963791_Seed_island_of_neoclassical_tearing_modes_at_ASDEX_Upgrade","228564105_Edge_Localized_Modes_in_Tokamaks","223640919_Stationary_and_transient_divertor_heat_flux_profiles_and_extrapolation_to_ITER","223473474_Linear_and_Nonlinear_Numerical_Approaches_to_Brake_Squeal_Noise","223024380_The_dynamics_and_structure_of_edge-localized-modes_in_Alcator_C-Mod","221891766_Improved_chopping_of_a_lithium_beam_for_plasma_edge_diagnostic_at_ASDEX_Upgrade","51764392_Edge_and_core_Thomson_scattering_systems_and_their_calibration_on_the_ASDEX_Upgrade_tokamak","33042119_Edge_localized_modes_and_the_pedestal_A_model_based_on_coupled_peeling-ballooning_modes","27278020_Nonaxisymmetric_Energy_Deposition_Pattern_on_ASDEX_Upgrade_Divertor_Target_Plates_during_Type-I_Edge-Localized_Modes","13250774_Study_of_Giant_Edge-Localized_Modes_in_DIII-D_and_Comparison_with_Ballooning_Theory"]}
