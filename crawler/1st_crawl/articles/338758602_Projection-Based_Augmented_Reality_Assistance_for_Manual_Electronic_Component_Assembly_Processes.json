{"id":"338758602_Projection-Based_Augmented_Reality_Assistance_for_Manual_Electronic_Component_Assembly_Processes","abstract":"Personalized production is moving the progress of industrial automation forward, and demanding new tools for improving the decision-making of the operators. This paper presents a new, projection-based augmented reality system for assisting operators during electronic component assembly processes. The paper describes both the hardware and software solutions, and depicts the results obtained during a usability test with the new system.","authors":["Marco Ojer","Hugo Alvarez","Ismael Serrano","Fatima Aurora Saiz"],"meta":["January 2020Applied Sciences 10(3):796","DOI:10.3390/app10030796"],"references":["340003216_Real-time_automatic_optical_system_to_assist_operators_in_the_assembling_of_electronic_components","336543778_Special_Issue_on_New_Industry_40_Advances_in_Industrial_IoT_and_Visual_Computing_for_Manufacturing_Processes","335220336_Reflections_on_the_Limited_Pervasiveness_of_Augmented_Reality_in_Industrial_Sectors","333360820_A_State_Validation_System_for_Augmented_Reality_Based_Maintenance_Procedures","332256248_Augmented_reality_system_to_guide_operators_in_the_setup_of_die_cutters","328308348_X-Reality_System_Architecture_for_Industry_40_Processes","327921400_Graphics_and_Media_Technologies_for_Operators_in_Industry_40","325787310_Speeded_Up_Detection_of_Squared_Fiducial_Markers","319707832_PROJECTOR-BASED_AUGMENTED_REALITY_FOR_QUALITY_INSPECTION_OF_SCANNED_OBJECTS","329263750_Visual_Computing_Technologies_to_support_the_Operator_40"]}
