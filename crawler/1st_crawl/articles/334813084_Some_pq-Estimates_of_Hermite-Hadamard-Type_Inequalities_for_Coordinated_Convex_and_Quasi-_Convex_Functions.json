{"id":"334813084_Some_pq-Estimates_of_Hermite-Hadamard-Type_Inequalities_for_Coordinated_Convex_and_Quasi-_Convex_Functions","abstract":"In this paper, we present the preliminaries of ( p , q ) -calculus for functions of two variables. Furthermore, we prove some new Hermite-Hadamard integral-type inequalities for convex functions on coordinates over [ a , b ] Ã— [ c , d ] by using the ( p , q ) -calculus of the functions of two variables. Furthermore, we establish an identity for the right-hand side of the Hermite-Hadamard-type inequalities on coordinates that is proven by using the ( p , q ) -calculus of the functions of two variables. Finally, we use the new identity to prove some trapezoidal-type inequalities with the assumptions of convexity and quasi-convexity on coordinates of the absolute values of the partial derivatives defined in the ( p , q ) -calculus of the functions of two variables.","authors":["Humaira Kalsoom","Muhammad Amer Latif","Moin-ud-Din Junjua","Sabir Hussain"],"meta":["July 2019","DOI:10.3390/math7080683"],"references":["333652827_Simpson's_Type_Inequalities_for_Co-Ordinated_Convex_Functions_on_Quantum_Calculus","330905703_Some_Quantum_Estimates_of_Hermite-Hadamard_Inequalities_for_Quasi-Convex_Functions","320730625_Generalized_Some_pq-Special_Polynomials","316943220_p_q-Hermite-Hadamard_inequalities_and_p_q-estimates_for_midpoint_type_inequalities_via_convex_and_quasi-convex_functions","308912178_q-Hermite_Hadamard_inequalities_and_quantum_estimates_for_midpoint_type_inequalities_via_convex_and_quasi-convex_functions","305888398_Some_q-analogues_of_Hermite-Hadamard_inequality_of_functions_of_two_variables_on_finite_rectangles_in_the_plane","304582266_p_q-INTEGRAL_INEQUALITIES","304582256_Some_integral_inequalities_via_pq-calculus_on_finite_intervals","329814839_HERMITE_HADAMARD'S_TYPE_INEQUALITIES_FOR_CO-ORDINATED_CONVEX_FUNCTIONS_ON_QUANTUM_INTEGRAL","316584552_Some_quantum_estimates_of_Hermite-Hadamard_inequalities_for_convex_functions"]}
