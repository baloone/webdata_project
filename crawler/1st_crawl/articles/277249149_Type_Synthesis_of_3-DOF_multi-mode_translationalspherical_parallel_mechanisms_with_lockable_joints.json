{"id":"277249149_Type_Synthesis_of_3-DOF_multi-mode_translationalspherical_parallel_mechanisms_with_lockable_joints","abstract":"A 3-DOF (degrees-of-freedom) multi-mode translational/spherical PM (parallel mechanism) with lockable joints is a novel reconfigurable PM. It has both 3-DOF spatial translational operation mode and 3-DOF spherical operation mode. This paper presents an approach to the type synthesis of translational/spherical PMs with lockable joints. Using the proposed approach, several 3-DOF translational/spherical PMs are obtained. It is found that these translational/spherical PMs do not encounter constraint singular configurations and self-motion of sub-chain of a leg during reconfiguration. The approach can also be used for synthesizing other classes of multi-mode PMs with lockable joints, multi-mode PMs with variable kinematic joints, partially decoupled PMs, and reconfigurable PMs with a reconfigurable platform.\n\nThe full paper can be accessed freely at http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094114X15000981","authors":["Xianwen Kong","Yan Jin"],"meta":["May 2015Mechanism and Machine Theory 25(6)","DOI:10.1016/j.mechmachtheory.2015.04.019","Project: Miniature flexible & reconfigurable manufacturing system for 3D Micro-products‚Äù (EP/K018345/1), July 2013 - December 2017"],"references":["277280317_Constraint-Based_Limb_Synthesis_and_Mobility-Change_Aimed_Mechanism_Construction","275383649_Mobility_Change_in_Two_Types_of_Metamorphic_Parallel_Mechanisms","270774962_Geometric_Constraint_and_Mobility_Variation_of_Two_3S_v_PS_v_Metamorphic_Parallel_Mechanisms","259508712_Reconfiguration_analysis_of_a_3-DOF_parallel_mechanism_using_Euler_parameter_quaternions_and_algebraic_geometry_method","245366061_Mobility_in_Metamorphic_Mechanisms_of_FoldableErectable_Kinds","224367149_Parallel_Mechanisms_With_Bifurcation_of_Schoenflies_Motion","224155843_Motion_Planning_for_a_Novel_Reconfigurable_Parallel_Manipulator_with_Lockable_Revolute_Joints","220104085_Two-mode_overconstrained_three-DOFs_rotational-translational_linear-motor-based_parallel-kinematics_mechanism_for_machine_tool_applications","3450311_Kinematic_design_of_a_6-DOF_parallel_manipulator_with_decoupled_translation_and_rotation","315013032_Block_Adjacency_Matrix_Method_for_Analyzing_the_Configuration_Transformations_of_Metamorphic_Parallel_Mechanisms","313009417_Mobility_in_metamorphic_mechanisms_of_foldableerectable_kinds","287239529_Type_Synthesis_of_Partially_Decoupled_2-DOF_Parallel_Mechanisms_with_Two_1T1R_Operational_Modes","278703894_Advances_in_Robot_Kinematics","277680855_Type_Synthesis_of_3-DOF_Parallel_Manipulators_With_Both_a_Planar_Operation_Mode_and_a_Spatial_Translational_Operation_Mode_1","275386252_Profile_Synthesis_of_Planar_Rotational-Translational_Variable_Joints","274865659_Design_of_a_Novel_4-DOF_Kinematotropic_Hybrid_Parallel_Manipulator","267489043_Constraint-Based_Limb_Synthesis_and_Mobility-Change-Aimed_Mechanism_Construction","263808717_Maximally_Regular_T2R1-Type_Parallel_Manipulators_With_Bifurcated_Spatial_Motion","262305874_A_new_class_of_reconfigurable_parallel_kinematic_machines","251891213_Type_synthesis_of_single-DOF_single-loop_mechanisms_with_two_operation_modes","245366495_Topological_Representations_and_Characteristics_of_Variable_Kinematic_Joints","241844177_Constraint_singularities_as_configuration_space_singularities","234040269_Type_Synthesis_of_Parallel_Mechanisms_With_Multiple_Operation_Modes","234040268_Type_Synthesis_of_Six-DOF_Wrist-Partitioned_Parallel_Manipulators","226224436_Parallel_robots_that_change_their_group_of_motion","223672208_Kinematic_design_of_a_family_of_6-DOF_partially_decoupled_parallel_manipulators","220688102_Type_Synthesis_of_Parallel_Mechanisms"]}
