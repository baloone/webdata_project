{"id":"308849453_Oh_SNAP_A_one-week_summer_computing_workshop_for_K-12_teachers","abstract":"Drag-and-drop programming is becoming increasingly popular among K-12 teachers and students. In this paper, we present our experience, findings, and lessons learned from conducting a one-week SNAP! summer computing workshop for K-12 teachers. Our workshop focused on introducing fundamental computing concepts to K-12 teachers using SNAP! a drag-and-drop programming development environment. During the workshop, the participants developed curricula for the subjects they will teach in the following semesters with the help of our workshop tutors. Our assessment results show that the average scores of computing knowledge in the pre-workshop survey was 2.52 out of 5, which increased to 3.76 in the post-workshop survey, and the average score of computing knowledge improved by 25%.","authors":["Jiangjiang Liu","Joshua Wilson","David Hemmenway","Yingbo Xu"],"meta":["July 2015","DOI:10.1109/ICCSE.2015.7250329","Conference: 2015 10th International Conference on Computer Science & Education (ICCSE)"],"references":["262330815_Making_computing_interesting_to_school_students_Teachers'_perspectives","262289623_Computational_thinking_outreach_reaching_across_the_K-12_curriculum","234781396_Connecting_undergraduate_programs_to_high_school_students_Teacher_workshops_on_computational_thinking_and_computer_science","221537948_Georgia_Computes_Improving_the_computing_education_pipeline","266653457_CS4Impact_measuring_computational_thinking_concepts_present_in_CS4HS_participant_lesson_plans","262325864_Making_games_a_snap_with_Stencyl_a_summer_computing_workshop_for_K-12_teachers","254007495_Weaving_a_tapestry_Creating_a_satellite_workshop_to_support_HS_CS_teachers_in_attracting_and_engaging_students","221536859_CS4HS_an_outreach_program_for_high_school_CS_teachers"]}
