{"id":"346541050_An_Acoustic_Survey_of_the_Cathedrale_Notre-Dame_de_Paris_before_and_after_the_Fire_of_2019","abstract":"The Cath√©drale Notre-Dame de Paris is amongst the most well-known worship spaces in the world. Its large volume, in combination with a relatively bare stone construction and marble floor, leads to rather long reverberation times. The cathedral suffered from a significant fire in 2019, resulting in damage primarily to the roof and vaulted ceiling. Despite the notoriety of this space, there are few examples of published data on the acoustical parameters of this space, and these data do not agree. Archived measurement recordings from 1987 were recovered and found to include several balloon bursts. In 2015, a measurement session was carried out for a virtual reality project. Comparisons between results from these two sessions show a slight but significant decrease in reverberation time (8%) in the pre-fire state. Measurements were recently carried out on the construction site, 1 year since the fire. Compared to 2015 data, the reverberation time significantly decreased (20%). This paper presents the preliminary results of these measurements, providing a documentation of the acoustics of this historic worship space both prior to and since the 2019 fire.","authors":["Brian F G Katz","Antoine Weber"],"meta":["December 2020Acoustics 2(4)","DOI:10.3390/acoustics2040044"],"references":["343627766_Measurements_of_Acoustical_Parameters_in_the_Ancient_Open-Air_Theatre_of_Tyndaris_Sicily_Italy","334513217_Acoustical_Impact_of_Architectonics_and_Material_Features_in_the_Lifespan_of_Two_Monumental_Sacred_Structures","308097722_Acoustics_of_Notre-Dame_cathedral_de_Paris","304896110_Understanding_the_acoustics_of_Papal_Basilicas_in_Rome_by_means_of_a_coupled-volumes_approach","343984998_The_Past_Has_Ears_PHE_XR_Explorations_of_Acoustic_Spaces_as_Cultural_Heritage","339312011_Understanding_the_acoustics_of_St_John's_Baptistery_in_Pisa_through_a_virtual_approach","320695483_Church_acoustics_A_state-of-the-art_review_after_several_decades_of_research","311749967_Perceptive_and_objective_evaluation_of_calibrated_room_acoustic_simulation_auralizations","305079655_Correction_method_for_averaging_slowly_time-variant_room_impulse_response_measurements","299354639_Concert_halls_with_strong_and_lateral_sound_increase_the_emotional_impact_of_orchestra_music"]}
