Dagger operations that satisfy the Conway identities [Stephen L. Bloom and Zoltán Ésik, Fixed-Point Operations on ccc's. Part I, Theoretical Computer Science (ISSN 0304-3975) 155 (1996), 1–38, doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/0304-3975(95)00010-0.] are particularly useful, because these identities imply a large class of identities used in semantic reasoning. We generalize existing techniques to define dagger operations on ω-categories and on O-categories. These operations enjoy a 2-categorical structure that implies the Conway identities. We illustrate these operators by considering applications to the semantics of session-typed languages.","authors":["Ryan Kavanagh"],"meta":["October 2020Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science 352:149-172","DOI:10.1016/j.entcs.2020.09.008"],"references":["231966472_Traced_monoidal_categories","322864835_Fixed_points_of_functors","321516456_Categories","319541048_Models_of_sharing_graphs_a_categorical_semantics_of_let_and_letrec","268614879_Review_of_the_elements_of_2-categories","245343813_An_interaction-based_programming_language_and_its_typing_system","226224258_Algebraically_complete_categories","223820138_Fixed-point_operations_on_ccc's_Part_I","221329680_The_Semantics_of_Simple_Language_for_Parallel_Programming","221040203_Definable_Operation_in_General_Algebras_and_the_Theory_of_Automata_and_Flowcharts"]}
