{"id":"317248060_Designing_and_implementing_transparency_for_real_time_inspection_of_autonomous_robots","abstract":"The EPSRC's Principles of Robotics advises the implementation of transparency in robotic systems, however research related to AI transparency is in its infancy. This paper introduces the reader of the importance of having transparent inspection of intelligent agents and provides guidance for good practice when developing such agents. By considering and expanding upon other prominent definitions found in literature, we provide a robust definition of transparency as a mechanism to expose the decision-making of a robot. The paper continues by addressing potential design decisions developers need to consider when designing and developing transparent systems. Finally, we describe our new interactive intelligence editor, designed to visualise, develop and debug real-time intelligence.","authors":["Andreas Theodorou","Robert H Wortham","Joanna J Bryson"],"meta":["July 2017Connection Science 29(3):230-241","DOI:10.1080/09540091.2017.1310182","Project: Robot Transparency"],"references":["322223875_ABOD3_A_Graphical_Visualization_and_Real-Time_Debugging_Tool_for_BOD_Agents","302593167_What_Does_the_Robot_Think_Transparency_as_a_Fundamental_Design_Requirement_for_Intelligent_Systems","301215240_Robot_Transparency_Trust_and_Utility","275550463_Research_Advance_in_Swarm_Robotics","266225237_Making_intelligent_systems_understandable_and_controllable_by_end_users","262377672_Behaviour_Oriented_Design_for_Real-Time-Strategy_Games_An_Approach_on_Iterative_Development_for_sc_StarCraft_AI","262377670_The_meaning_of_the_EPSRC_principles_of_robotics","246449429_Integrating_Life-Like_Action_Selection_into_Cycle-Based_Agent_Simulation_Environments","241623860_Do_people_hold_a_humanoid_robot_morally_accountable_for_the_harm_it_causes","221516553_How_it_works_A_field_study_of_non-technical_users_interacting_with_an_intelligent_system","26808863_Trust_and_Reliance_on_an_Automated_Combat_Identification_System","15314707_Temporal_Mechanisms_In_Perception","4048509_Matching_robot_appearance_and_behavior_to_tasks_to_improve_human-robot_cooperation","2553452_The_Behavior-Oriented_Design_of_Modular_Agent_Intelligence","313609591_Matching_robot_appearance_and_behavior_to_tasks_to_improve_human-robot_cooperation","280578491_Towards_Artificial_Emotions_to_Assist_Social_Coordination_in_HRI","243653974_Integrating_Planning_and_Reaction_in_a_Heterogeneous_Asynchronous_Architecture_for_Controlling_Mobile_Robots","233590803_Can_robots_be_teammates_Benchmarks_in_human-robot_teams","224058157_Who_Should_I_Blame_Effects_of_Autonomy_and_Transparency_on_Attributions_in_Human-Robot_Interaction","223067975_The_role_of_trust_in_automation_reliance","221605277_Integrating_Planning_and_Reacting_in_a_Heterogeneous_Asynchronous_Architecture_for_Controlling_Real-World_Mobile_Robots","220605063_How_People_Talk_with_Robots_Designing_Dialog_to_Reduce_User_Uncertainty","220457578_Humans_and_Automation_Use_Misuse_Disuse_Abuse"]}
