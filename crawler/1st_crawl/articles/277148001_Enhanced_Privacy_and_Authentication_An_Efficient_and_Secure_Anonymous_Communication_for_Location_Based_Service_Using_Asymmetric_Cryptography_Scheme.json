{"id":"277148001_Enhanced_Privacy_and_Authentication_An_Efficient_and_Secure_Anonymous_Communication_for_Location_Based_Service_Using_Asymmetric_Cryptography_Scheme","abstract":"ast few years, the mobile technology and location based services have experienced a great increment in number of its users. The privacy issues related to these services are becoming main concerns because of the leakage of usersâ€™ private information and contents. To prevent revelation of private information, many researchers have proposed several secure and authentication schemes which apply various technologies to provide integral security properties, such as symmetric encryption, digital signature, timestamp, etc. Unfortunately, some of these schemes still exhibit security and efficiency issues. In this research paper, we proposed an efficient and secure anonymous communication for location based service using asymmetric cryptography scheme over the wireless system was attempted missing some system detail. We also proposed the prevent user private information and secure communication by asymmetric cryptography scheme. We solved the wireless communication problem in A3 algorithm such as eavesdropping and this problem solved by asymmetric cryptography scheme because of its robustness against this type of attack by providing mutual authentication make the system more secure. Finally, performance and cost analysis show our scheme is more suitable for low-power and resource limited wireless system and thus availability for real implementation. According to our security analysis and performance, we can prove that our proposed asymmetric cryptography scheme is able to improve wireless communication system security and enhance efficiency in comparison to previous schemes","authors":["Imran Memon","Ibrar Hussain","Rizwan Akhtar","Gencai Chen"],"meta":["May 2015Wireless Personal Communications 84(2)","DOI:10.1007/s11277-015-2699-1"],"references":["262249707_An_Experimental_Security_Analysis_of_Two_Satphone_Standards","244476949_A_Survey_on_Smartphone-Based_Systems_for_Opportunistic_User_Context_Recognition","242330948_A_location-based_personal_task_reminder_for_mobile_users","220334843_Self-Generated-Certificate_Public_Key_Cryptography_and_Certificateless_Signature_Encryption_Scheme_in_the_Standard_Model","2843631_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","312457952_A_logic_of_authentication_ACM_Trans_Comput","297684673_Certificateless_public_key_cryptography","290611805_Topology_aware_convention_emergence","288492337_Poster","285887091_Certificateless_Public_Key_Cryptography","271659851_Design_and_Implementation_to_Authentication_over_a_GSM_System_Using_Certificate-Less_Public_Key_Cryptography_CL-PKC","269775707_Architecture_of_Hybrid_Mobile_Social_Networks_for_Efficient_Content_Delivery","267158993_Rumor_Riding_An_Anonymity_Approach_for_Decentralized_Peer_to_Peer_Systems","266654988_Enhancing_security_in_mobile_data_networks_through_end_user_and_core_network_cooperation","266653904_Composite_trust-based_public_key_management_in_mobile_ad_hoc_networks","263392477_Cryptanalysis_and_Improvement_of_a_Robust_Smart_Card_Authentication_Scheme_for_Multi-server_Architecture","262880206_An_efficient_and_secure_anonymous_mobility_network_authentication_scheme","262836797_HardwareSoftware_Co-Design_of_Elliptic-Curve_Cryptography_for_Resource-Constrained_Applications","262348382_On_the_properties_of_public_key_encryption_from_group_signatures","262319126_How_to_keep_a_secret_Leakage_deterring_public-key_cryptosystems","262314749_POSTER_A_pairing-free_Certificateless_Hybrid_Sign-Cryption_scheme_for_Advanced_Metering_Infrastructures","262243766_Security_and_privacy_of_electric_vehicles_in_the_smart_grid_context_problem_and_solution","262241705_The_CRNS_Framework_and_its_Application_to_Programmable_and_Reconfigurable_Cryptography","262176462_A_privacy-preserving_location-based_alert_system","257676071_Robust_Anonymous_Two-Factor_Authentication_Scheme_for_Roaming_Service_in_Global_Mobility_Network","254462348_Certificateless_strong_designated_verifier_multisignature_scheme_using_bilinear_pairings","239939589_A_Secure_and_Effective_Anonymous_Authentication_Scheme_for_Roaming_Service_in_Global_Mobility_Networks","224174268_Highly_Acyclic_Groups_Hypergraph_Covers_and_the_Guarded_Fragment","221609646_Poster_a_certificateless_proxy_re-encryption_scheme_for_cloud-based_data_sharing","221406469_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","221193544_Security_and_Trust_of_Public_Key_Cryptography_Options_for_HIP","221005667_A_man-in-the-middle_attack_on_UMTS","220439192_A_Logic_of_Authentication"]}
