{"id":"330412456_IJETTCS-2017-07-20-23","abstract":"Cloud computing is an emerging trend in computer science. We can define cloud computing as \"pay as per use\" service. Today, cloud computing infrastructure is most demanding due to its low-cost of network and storage services. With the increasing number of users, data and network security becomes the major issue in cloud environment. However, there are many approaches available, perspective of security of data, e.g. Authentication for accessing the data, network communication mechanism, third party assignment policy. In this paper, we survey about the security issues related to cloud computing. Here we describe some major security issues and challenges in cloud computing.","authors":["Jitendra kumar Samriya"],"meta":["July 2017","Project: cloud security"],"references":["312659216_A_differential_game_model_of_intrusion_detection_system_in_cloud_computing","310451800_E-eco_Performance-Aware_Energy-Efficient_Cloud_Data_Center_Orchestration","306300767_Survey_on_Data_Integrity_in_Cloud","294775501_Using_Virtual_Machine_Allocation_Policies_to_Defend_against_Co-Resident_Attacks_in_Cloud_Computing","289756317_Security_Threats_on_Cloud_Computing_Vulnerabilities","316530938_Extenuate_DDoS_attacks_in_Cloud","311611223_Secure_authentication_for_data_protection_in_cloud_computing_using_color_schemes","310590555_Novel_Fuzzy_Multi_Objective_DVFS-aware_Consolidation_Heuristics_for_Energy_and_SLA_Efficient_Resource_Management_in_Cloud_Data_Centers","308772519_The_features_hardware_and_architectures_of_data_center_networks_A_survey","308390041_Green_Latency-aware_Data_Placement_in_Data_Centers","284158931_Analysis_and_Prevention_of_Account_Hijacking_based_INCIDENTS_in_Cloud_Environment","272385805_DROPS_Division_and_Replication_of_Data_in_the_Cloud_for_Optimal_Performance_and_Security","286561716_The_threats_of_data_security_over_the_Cloud_as_perceived_by_experts_and_university_students","282619204_Eavesdropping_Prevention_for_Network_Coding_Encrypted_Cloud_Storage_Systems","274782421_Distributed_Denial_of_Service_Attacks_in_Software-Defined_Networking_with_Cloud_Computing"]}
