{"id":"298326722_A_minimalistic_many-valued_theory_of_types","abstract":"A parsimonious Church-style theory of types TT 0 TT0 is introduced that admits Henkin-style models over algebras of truth values for a broad class of non-classical logics. The\nonly logical symbols of TT 0 TT0 are the constants for (many-valued) equality on each type, governed by the derivation rules of substitution, intersubstitutivity\nof equals, λ λ-abstraction and extensionality. The strong soundness and completeness of TT 0 TT0 w.r.t. the Henkin-style semantics is proved. A broad range of non-classical Henkin-style higher-order logics can be cast\nas extensions of TT 0 TT0 and their Henkin completeness be obtained by minor addenda to the proof for TT 0 TT0. Three sample extensions of TT 0 TT0 are introduced and their Henkin completeness proved.","authors":["Libor Behounek"],"meta":["March 2016Journal of Logic and Computation 27(5):exw006","DOI:10.1093/logcom/exw006"],"references":["267009206_Introduction_to_mathematical_fuzzy_logic","220245280_EQ-algebra-based_fuzzy_type_theory_and_its_extensions","317847368_Applied_Logic_Series","313719954_Fuzzy_type_theory_as_high_order_fuzzy_logic","222815740_Fuzzy_class_theory","222429784_On_fuzzy_type_theory","38375227_Completeness_in_the_Theory_of_Types","38373839_A_Formulation_of_the_Simple_Theory_of_Types"]}
