{"id":"261952337_Going_Higher_in_the_First-Order_Quantifier_Alternation_Hierarchy_on_Words","abstract":"We investigate the quantifier alternation hierarchy in first-order logic on\nfinite words. Levels in this hierarchy are defined by counting the number of\nquantifier alternations in formulas. We prove that one can decide membership of\na regular language to the levels $\\mathcal{B}\\Sigma_2$ (boolean combination of\nformulas having only 1 alternation) and $\\Sigma_3$ (formulas having only 2\nalternations beginning with an existential block). Our proof works by\nconsidering a deeper problem, called separation, which, once solved for lower\nlevels, allows us to solve membership for higher levels.","authors":["Thomas Place","Marc Zeitoun"],"meta":["April 2014","DOI:10.1007/978-3-662-43951-7_29","SourcearXiv","Conference: International Colloquium on Automata, Languages, and Programming"],"references":["242604307_Monoids_of_upper-triangular_matrices","235772028_Efficient_Separability_of_Regular_Languages_by_Subsequences_and_Suffixes","221590153_Over_Words_Two_Variables_Are_as_Powerful_as_One_Quantifier_Alternation","220200463_New_decidable_upper_bound_of_the_second_level_in_the_Straubing-Therien_concatenation_hierarchy_of_star-free_languages","2510507_Some_Algorithmic_Problems_for_Pseudovarieties","283926055_Diamonds_are_forever_The_variety_DA","281885951_Separating_Regular_Languages_by_Locally_Testable_and_Locally_Threshold_Testable_Languages","266984920_On_Separation_by_Locally_Testable_and_Locally_Threshold_Testable_Languages","266433584_Finite_Automata_Formal_Logic_and_Circuit_Complexity","262407404_Regular_Languages_of_Infinite_Trees_That_Are_Boolean_Combinations_of_Open_Sets","260194322_Separating_Regular_Languages_with_First-Order_Logic","243677621_Finite_semigroup_varieties_of_the_form_V_D","243046057_The_wreath_product_principle_for_ordered_semigroups","236326036_Separating_Regular_Languages_by_Piecewise_Testable_and_Unambiguous_Languages","228555297_The_wreath_product_principle_for_ordered_semigroups","225608503_Polynomial_Closure_and_Unambiguous_Product","225206495_Theme_and_Variations_on_the_Concatenation_Product","225158038_The_Height_of_Factorization_Forests","223687719_Dot-Depth_of_Star-Free_Events","222446091_On_finite_monoids_having_only_trivial_subgroups","222445123_Classifying_regular_events_in_symbolic_logic","222437820_The_dot-depth_hierarchy_of_star-free_languages_is_infinite","222352104_Factorization_forests_of_finite_height","221350055_A_Concatenation_Game_and_the_Dot-Depth_Hierarchy","221220325_Piecewise_testable_events","221212559_Factorization_Forests","220994779_Polynomial_Operations_on_Rational_Languages","220150628_A_Generalization_of_the_Schutzenberger_Product_of_Finite_Monoids","220150131_Semigroups_and_Languages_of_Dot-Depth_Two","220149035_Classification_of_Finite_Monoids_The_Language_Approach","2856056_Bridges_for_Concatenation_Hierarchies","2524950_Diamonds_Are_Forever_The_Variety_DA"]}
