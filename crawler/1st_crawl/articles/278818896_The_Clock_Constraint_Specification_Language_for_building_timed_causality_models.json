{"id":"278818896_The_Clock_Constraint_Specification_Language_for_building_timed_causality_models","abstract":"The UML Profile for Modeling and Analysis of Real-Time and Embedded (RTE) systems has recently been adopted by the OMG. Its Time Model extends the informal and simplistic Simple Time package proposed by UML2 and offers a broad range of capabilities required to model RTE systems including discrete/-dense and chronometric/logical time. The MARTE specification introduces a Time Structure inspired from several time models of the concurrency theory and proposes a new clock constraint specification language (CCSL) to specify, within the context of the UML, logical and chronometric time constraints. A semantic model in CCSL is attached to a (UML) model to give its timed causality semantics. In that sense, CCSL is comparable to the Ptolemy environment , in which directors give the semantics to models according to predefined models of computation and communication. This paper focuses on one historical model of computation of Ptolemy (SDF-Synchronous Data Flow) and shows how to build SDF graphs by combining UML models and CCSL.","authors":["Frédéric Mallet","Julien Deantoni","Charles André","Robert de Simone"],"meta":["March 2010"],"references":["222520110_Semantics_and_Verification_of_Data_Flow_in_UML_20_Activities","221655123_Specification_and_Verification_of_Time_Requirements_with_CCSL_and_Esterel","220999331_LTS_semantics_for_use_case_models","220473431_Taming_Heterogeneity_-_The_Ptolemy_Approach","220403886_Eshuis_R_Symbolic_model_checking_of_uml_activity_diagrams_TOSEM","298844145_High_level_system_design_and_analysis_using_abstract_state_machines","242911544_Properties_of_a_Model_for_Parallel_Computations_Determinacy_Termination_Queueing","225242336_Extending_Statecharts_with_Process_Algebra_Operators","222594748_USE_A_UML-based_specification_environment_for_validating_UML_and_OCL","220882360_Using_p_-_calculus_to_Formalize_UML_Activity_Diagram"]}
