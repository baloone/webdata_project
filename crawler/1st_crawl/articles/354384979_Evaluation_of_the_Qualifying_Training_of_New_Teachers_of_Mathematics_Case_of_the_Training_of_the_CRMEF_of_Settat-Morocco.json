{"id":"354384979_Evaluation_of_the_Qualifying_Training_of_New_Teachers_of_Mathematics_Case_of_the_Training_of_the_CRMEF_of_Settat-Morocco","abstract":"This research aims to measure the impact of training on the professional qualification of teacher-trainees in all the specifications, behaviors, skills and professional competence corresponding to the practice of the teaching profession by deploying the Kirkpatrick model. To do this, we sent a questionnaire to the mathematics teacher-trainees who benefited from the qualifying training in CRMEF-Settat (Promotion 2019). We, subsequently, conducted an interview with the majority of their trainers. This study allowed us to detect dysfunctions: At the organizational level: Mismatch between the specialty of the diploma obtained by the trainee teachers (physics, chemistry, computer science) and the subject they will be teaching (Mathematics), Lack of an adequate structure at the CRMEF likely to take care of the management and implementation of the MSP (the practical situations) and Insufficient time training. And at the educational level: Insufficient communication between trainers and teacher-trainees, and Lack of support for these teachers in internship places during the MSP period.
