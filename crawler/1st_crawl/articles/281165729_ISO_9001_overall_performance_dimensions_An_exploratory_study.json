{"id":"281165729_ISO_9001_overall_performance_dimensions_An_exploratory_study","abstract":"Purpose\n– The purpose of this paper is to validate and assess the performance dimensions reflecting ISO 9001 benefits in service companies and to determine their relationships.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\n– A research study was carried out in 198 ISO 9001:2008 certified Greek service companies. Data were obtained through a structured questionnaire and have been analyzed with exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses.\n\nFindings\n– Four performance dimensions reflecting ISO 9001 benefits are extracted and validated, namely, product/service quality, operational, market and financial performance.\n\nResearch limitations/implications\n– The research sample is limited to small and medium-sized enterprises operating in a specific European country. Further research may confirm the findings of this study to other countries as well.\n\nPractical implications\n– By determining and evaluating the performance dimensions and their inter-relationships, the ISO 9001 certified service companies are assisted to select an appropriate strategy to further improve their performance and competitiveness. The suggested model can be also used as a self-assessment and benchmarking tool for managers and practitioners alike.\n\nOriginality/value\n– The present study provides a comprehensive model of performance dimensions reflecting ISO 9001 benefits in service companies.","authors":["Evangelos Psomas","Angelos Pantouvakis"],"meta":["August 2015TQM Journal
