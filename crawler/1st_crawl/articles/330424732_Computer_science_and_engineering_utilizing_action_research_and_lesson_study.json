{"id":"330424732_Computer_science_and_engineering_utilizing_action_research_and_lesson_study","abstract":"This article explores one groupâ€™s use of action research (AR) and lesson study in three US university-level computer science courses affecting 85 undergraduate computer science and engineering students. It offers an overview of three areas including AR, lesson study, and engineering soft skills. The research group identified a problem: undergraduate engineering student soft skill understanding. The group collaborated to enhance participant engagement with this problem by utilizing one lesson focused on soft skills over three research lesson iterations in three distinct university semesters (2017-2018). Field notes were the main data collection method. Observational field notes were recorded in the three research lesson iterations, and themes from the notes were identified. The group valued peer interactions, and the research lesson adaptations as well as pedagogical changes were based on evidence. Four themes were identified, and participant comments were considered as the lessons became more focused . The research group argues that AR and lesson study are separate and distinct ventures based on this yearlong experience, which is counter to some other literature presented. Implications are large for all stakeholders interested in AR, lesson study, soft skill utilization, conflict management, and participant learning impact. Possibilities for enhanced participant engagement exists with honed lesson pedagogy.","authors":["Andrea Burrows","Mike Borowczak"],"meta":["January 2019Educational Action Research 27(4):1-16","DOI:10.1080/09650792.2019.1566082","Project: Cybersecurity & CS Education And Research"],"references":["327350987_Rethinking_construction_curriculum_A_descriptive_cause_analysis_for_the_soft_skills_gap_among_construction_graduates","313583222_Cooperative_learning_in_organic_chemistry_increases_student_assessment_of_learning_gains_in_key_transferable_skills","286529191_Experiencing_action_evaluation's_cyclic_process_partnering_conflict_reflection_and_action","281526306_Fostering_21_st_Century_Skills_in_Engineering_Undergraduates_through_Co-Curricular_Involvement","281378066_Communication_In_STEM_Education_A_Non-Intrusive_Method_for_Assessment_K20_Educator_Feedback","280295804_Women's_Representation_in_Science_Predicts_National_Gender-Science_Stereotypes_Evidence_From_66_Nations","272741276_Contribution_of_Shell_Eco-Marathon_engineering_design_experience_to_soft_skills_development_A_qualitative_analysis_in_the_Asian_context","242574847_How_Should_Research_Contribute_to_Instructional_Improvement_The_Case_of_Lesson_Study","242567899_Why_Action_Research","333622637_Alignment_of_Regional_and_ABET_Accreditation_Efforts_An_Efficient_Approach_to_Assessment_of_Student_Learning_Outcomes","326538622_The_Unwritten_Laws_of_Engineering","312100044_Leading_the_introduction_and_development_of_lesson_and_learning_study_in_an_English_Secondary_Academy","309443953_Engineering_practice-a_junior_level_course_to_develop_the_SOFT_SKILLS_in_engineering","291564494_The_Unwritten_Laws_of_Engineering","290728868_Implementation_of_Leadership_and_Service_Learning_in_a_First-Year_Engineering_Course_Enhances_Professional_Skills","289684820_Preparing_Next_Generation_Graduates_for_a_Global_Engineering_WorkforceInsights_from_Tomorrow's_Engineers","276091166_Engineering_Students'_Perceptions_of_Soft_Skills_Industry_Expectations_and_Career_Aspirations","273526466_Engineers_and_Engineeresses_Self-conceptions_and_the_Development_of_Gendered_Professional_Identities","271904268_Transformations_in_Technical_Communicat_ion_Pedagogy_Engineering_Writing_and_the_ABET_Engineering_Criteria_2000","269304229_A_model_for_on-line_education_of_ABET-required_professional_aspects_of_engineering","261953087_Gender_Differences_in_Scholastic_Achievement_A_Meta-Analysis","252653466_Lesson_Study_as_a_Model_for_Building_Pedagogical_Knowledge_and_Improving_Teaching","249704761_Learning_from_Japanese_Approaches_to_Professional_Development_The_Case_of_Lesson_Study","235362280_Working_With_Emotional_Intelligence"]}
