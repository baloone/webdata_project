{"id":"221354712_A_Design_Principle_for_Hash_Functions","abstract":"We show that if there exists a computationally collision free function f from m bits to t bits where m > t, then there exists a computationally collision free function h mapping messages of arbitrary polynomial lengths to t-bit strings.\n\nLet n be the length of the message. h can be constructed either such that it can be evaluated in time linear in n using 1 processor, or such that it takes time O(log(n)) using O(n) processors, counting evaluations of f as one step. Finally, for any constant k and large n, a speedup by a factor of k over the first construction is available using k processors.\n\nApart from suggesting a generally sound design principle for hash functions, our results give a unified view of several apparently unrelated constructions of hash functions proposed earlier. It also suggests changes to other proposed constructions to make a proof of security potentially easier.\n\nWe give three concrete examples of constructions, based on modular squaring, on Wolfram’s pseudoranddom bit generator [Wo], and on the knapsack problem.","authors":["Ivan Damgård"],"meta":["January 1989","DOI:10.1007/0-387-34805-0_39","SourceDBLP","Conference: Advances in Cryptology - CRYPTO '89, 9th Annual International Cryptology Conference, Santa Barbara, California, USA, August 20-24, 1989, Proceedings"],"references":["226671358_Collision_Free_Hash_Functions_and_Public_Key_Signature_Schemes","221354656_One_Way_Hash_Functions_and_DES","221347911_Hash-Functions_Using_Modulo-N_Operations","239538793_The_application_of_digital_signatures_based_on_public_key_cryptosystems","238683416_Random_Sequence_Generation_by_Cellular_Automata","221355622_Producing_a_One-Way_Hash_Function_from_DES","221348201_Manipulations_and_Errors_Detection_and_Localization","220421822_Digital_Signatures_with_RSA_and_Other_Public-Key_Cryptosystems","3501868_Efficient_cryptographic_schemes_provably_as_secure_as_subset_sum"]}
