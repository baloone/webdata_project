{"id":"280601129_Modeling_and_Simulation_of_a_Quadrotor_using_Curve_Fitting_Method","abstract":"This study focuses on aerodynamic modeling of a rotor for an AscTec Hummingbird quadrotor used for\ncontrols research at the METU Aerospace Engineering Department through the wind tunnel tests and to\ndevelop a high fidelity simulation model for the quadrotor. The main factors which determine the movement\nof a quadrotor are the aerodynamic forces and moments in three axes created by four rotors. Hence, accurate calculation of rotor forces and moments in varying flight conditions are essential to get a precise simulationof\nthe quadrotor. Instead of using analytical models for aerodynamic forces and moments of a rotor derived\nusing blade element and momentum theories, a second order polynomial rotor model has been developed by\nMATLAB Curve Fitting algorithm. The developed empirical model allows us to accurately predict\naerodynamic loads on a quadrotor in various rotor speeds and flight conditions. Thanks to the new method\nused in this study, the parameters are integrated easiliy into the simulation of the quadrotor in different flight\nconditions. Besides, an accurate simulation is conducted by taking into account hub force, rolling moment,\nand body effect which are usually ignored.","authors":["Derya Kaya","Ali Kutay"],"meta":["June 2015","DOI:10.2514/6.2015-2706","Conference: American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, AviationAt: Dallas"],"references":["313029063_Basic_helicopter_aerodynamics_Second_edition","269193979_Aerodynamic_Modeling_and_Parameter_Estimation_of_a_Quadrotor_Helicopter","235198348_Dynamics_of_Atmospheric_Flight"]}
