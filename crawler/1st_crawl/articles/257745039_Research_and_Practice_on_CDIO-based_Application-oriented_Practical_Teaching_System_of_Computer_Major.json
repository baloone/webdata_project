{"id":"257745039_Research_and_Practice_on_CDIO-based_Application-oriented_Practical_Teaching_System_of_Computer_Major","abstract":"On the basis of in-depth understanding of the teaching model of CDIO project education, practice teaching system of computer major was constructed. The “project driven” based practical model was used to deepen the students’ understanding of theoretical knowledge, to equip students with the ability to develop actual engineering systems, and to train the ability of students to solve actual problems and the innovation and team spirit. Practice proved that CDIO is an effective practical teaching model.","authors":["Guo Lingling","Tang Guowei","Fu Yu","Li Jinghui"],"meta":["December 2012IERI Procedia 2:24–29","DOI:10.1016/j.ieri.2012.06.046"],"references":["292809180_A_macro-view_of_engineering_and_the_reform_of_higher_engineering_educationJ","246657302_The_Effect_Of_Atropine_On_Cerebral_Perfusion_During_Systemic_Hypotension_1421","224257862_Study_on_interest-driven_based_practical_teaching_model","224161495_Exploration_and_practice_on_case-driven_research-based_teaching_model"]}
