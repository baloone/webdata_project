{"id":"4350166_Analysis_of_Historical_Artistic_Documentaries","abstract":"The paper introduces a novel interdisciplinary project addressing the analysis of historical artistic films. The type of employed material has not been subject to automatic analyses, so far. It poses challenges in all areas of content-based analysis and retrieval due to its complex temporal structure and due to substantial degradations. We propose robust features and a method for shot cut detection for this material that outperforms established techniques.","authors":["Matthias Zeppelzauer","Dalibor Mitrovic","Christian Breiteneder"],"meta":["June 2008","DOI:10.1109/WIAMIS.2008.11","SourceIEEE Xplore","Conference: Image Analysis for Multimedia Interactive Services, 2008.
