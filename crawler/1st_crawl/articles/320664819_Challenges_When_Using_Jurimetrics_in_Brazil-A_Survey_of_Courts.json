{"id":"320664819_Challenges_When_Using_Jurimetrics_in_Brazil-A_Survey_of_Courts","abstract":"Jurimetrics is the application of quantitative methods, usually statistics, to law. An important step to implement a jurimetric analysis is to extract raw data from courts and organize that data in a way that can be processed. Most of the raw data is unstructured and written in natural language, which stands as a challenge to Computer Science experts. As it requires expertise in law, statistics, and computer science, jurimetrics is a multidisciplinary field. When trying to implement a jurimetric system in Brazil, additional challenges were identified due to the heterogeneity of the different court systems, the lack of standards, and how the open data laws in Brazil are interpreted and implemented. In this article, we present a survey of Brazilian courts in terms of readiness to implement a jurimetric system. Analyzing a sample of data, we have found, in light of Brazil's open data regulation, privacy issues and technical issues. Finally, we propose a roadmap that encompasses both technology and public policy to meet those challenges.","authors":["Bruna Armonas Colombo","Pedro Buck","Vinicius Miana"],"meta":["October 2017Future Internet 9(4):68","DOI:10.3390/fi9040068"],"references":["309620406_The_Relationship_between_Judicial_Staff_and_Court_Performance_Evidence_from_Brazilian_State_Courts","261791640_JURIMETRICS_THE_NEXT_STEP_FORWARD","221348053_CAPTCHA_using_hard_AI_problems_for_security","220426503_Middleware_A_Model_for_Distributed_System_Services"]}
