{"id":"341373408_Denzin's_Paradigm_Shift_Revisiting_Triangulation_in_Qualitative_Research","abstract":"One approach to promote social change, mitigate bias, and enhance reaching data saturation is through triangulation: multiple sources of data. Triangulation adds depth to the data that are collected. In this scholarly essay, the authors discuss the continuing relevance of Denzin’s approach to triangulation of data. Included is a critique of researchers who have posited other approaches to triangulation that appear to be merely a renaming of Denzin’s original paradigm rather new outcomes. The intended audience is novice researchers and doctoral students who can benefit from clarity on some common misconceptions about triangulation.","authors":["Patricia Fusch","Gene E Fusch","Lawrence Ness"],"meta":["January 2018","DOI:10.5590/JOSC.2018.10.1.02"],"references":["315753982_How_to_Conduct_a_Mini-Ethnographic_Case_Study_A_Guide_for_Novice_Researchers","313551785_Understanding_reliability_and_validity_in_qualitative_research","286654441_Beyond_Words_Using_Nonverbal_Communication_Data_in_Research_to_Enhance_Thick_Description_and_Interpretation","347809071_Triangulation_Establishing_the_Validity_of_Qualitative_Studies","338274914_I_Am_a_Fieldnote_Fieldnotes_as_a_Symbol_of_Professional_Identity","326216085_Being_Evidence_Based_in_Library_and_Information_Practice","324353742_Unobtrusive_Measures_Nonreactive_Research_in_the_Social_Sciences","317953648_Naturalistic_inquiry","317618293_Conjectures_and_Refutations_The_Growth_of_Scientific_Knowledge","304496314_Qualitative_research_and_evaluation_methods_London_Sage_Publications"]}
