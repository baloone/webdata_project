{"id":"221321274_The_Direct_Cost_of_Virtual_Function_Calls_in_C","abstract":"We study the direct cost of virtual function calls in C++ programs, assuming the standard implementation using virtual function tables. We measure this overhead experimentally for a number of large benchmark programs, using a combination of executable inspection and processor simulation. Our results show that the C++ programs measured spend a median of 5.2% of their time and 3.7% of their instructions in dispatch code. For \"all virtuals\" versions of the programs, the median overhead rises to 13.7% (13% of the instructions). The \"thunk\" variant of the virtual function table implementation reduces the overhead by a median of 21% relative to the standard implementation. On future processors, these overheads are likely to increase moderately.","authors":["Karel Driesen","Urs HÃ¶lzle"],"meta":["October 1996ACM SIGPLAN Notices 31(10):306-323","DOI:10.1145/236338.236369","SourceDBLP","Conference: Proceedings of the 11th ACM SIGPLAN conference on Object-oriented programming, systems, languages, and applicationsVolume: 31"],"references":["221496555_Do_Object-Oriented_Languages_Need_Special_Hardware_Support","221496253_Message_Dispatch_on_Pipelined_Processors","2720725_Profile-Guided_Receiver_Class_Prediction","2459095_Dynamic_Dispatch_in_Object-Oriented_Languages","278412234_EEL","246493156_Intel''s_P6_Uses_Decoupled_Superscalar_Design","238711103_Evaluating_virtual_dispatch_mechanisms_for_C","238676135_An_assessment_of_method-lookup_caches_for_smalltalk-80_implementations","225092342_The_Annotated_C_Reference_Manual","221596275_Shade_A_Fast_Instruction-Set_Simulator_for_Execution_Profiling","221496597_Eliminating_Virtual_Function_Calls_in_C_Programs","221496405_Optimizing_Dynamically-Typed_Object-Oriented_Languages_With_Polymorphic_Inline_Caches","221320546_Fast_Dispatch_Mechanisms_for_Stock_Hardware","220997074_Efficient_Implementation_of_the_Smalltalk-80_System","220751891_EEL_Machine-Independent_Executable_Editing","220657012_Multiple_Inheritance_in_SIMULA-like_Languages","220475280_What_Price_Smalltalk","2350670_Reducing_Indirect_Function_Call_Overhead_In_C_Programs"]}
