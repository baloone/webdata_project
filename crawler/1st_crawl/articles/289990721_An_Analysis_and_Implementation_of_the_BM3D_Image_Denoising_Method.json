{"id":"289990721_An_Analysis_and_Implementation_of_the_BM3D_Image_Denoising_Method","abstract":"BM3D is a recent denoising method based on the fact that an image has a locally sparse representation in transform domain. This sparsity is enhanced by grouping similar 2D image patches into 3D groups. In this paper we propose an open-source implementation of the method. We discuss the choice of all parameter methods and confirm their actual optimality. The description of the method is rewritten with a new notation. We hope this new notation is more transparent than in the original paper. A final index gives nonetheless the correspondence between the new notation and the original notation.","authors":["Marc Lebrun"],"meta":["August 2012Image Processing On Line 2:175-213","DOI:10.5201/ipol.2012.l-bm3d"],"references":["289129801_Rudin-Osher-Fatemi_Total_Variation_Denoising_using_Split_Bregman","284568577_Non-Local_Means_Denoising","272643634_DCT_Image_Denoising_a_Simple_and_Effective_Image_Denoising_Algorithm","270992999_An_Implementation_and_Detailed_Analysis_of_the_K-SVD_Image_Denoising_Algorithm","232768007_Algebraic_Lens_Distortion_Model_Estimation","51914243_BM3D_Frames_and_Variational_Image_Deblurring","299532439_Local_approximation_techniques_in_signal_and_image_processing","224254723_Natural_image_denoising_Optimality_and_inherent_bounds","224145634_Comments_on_Image_Denoising_by_Sparse_3-D_Transform-Domain_Collaborative_Filtering","221125561_Decoupled_inverse_and_denoising_for_image_deblurring_Variational_BM3D-frame_technique"]}
