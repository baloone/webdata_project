{"id":"305638557_Packing_trees_of_unbounded_degrees_in_random_graphs","abstract":"In this paper, we address the problem of packing large trees in $G_{n,p}$. In particular, we prove the following result. Suppose that $T_1, \\dotsc, T_N$ are $n$-vertex trees, each of which has maximum degree at most $(np)^{1/6} / (\\log n)^6$. Then with high probability, one can find edge-disjoint copies of all the $T_i$ in the random graph $G_{n,p}$, provided that $p \\geq (\\log n)^{36}/n$ and $N \\le (1-\\varepsilon)np/2$ for a positive constant $\\varepsilon$. Moreover, if each $T_i$ has at most $(1-\\alpha)n$ vertices, for some positive $\\alpha$, then the same result holds under the much weaker assumptions that $p \\geq (\\log n)^2/(cn)$ and $\\Delta(T_i) \\leq c np / \\log n$ for some~$c$ that depends only on $\\alpha$ and $\\varepsilon$. Our assumptions on maximum degrees of the trees are significantly weaker than those in all previously known approximate packing results.","authors":["Asaf Ferber","Wojciech Samotij"],"meta":["July 2016Journal of the London Mathematical Society 99(3)","DOI:10.1112/jlms.12179"],"references":["305857650_Almost_all_trees_are_almost_graceful","304642715_Packing_perfect_matchings_in_random_hypergraphs","288890271_Packing_spanning_graphs_from_separable_families","344485423_Concentration_Inequalities_A_Nonasymptotic_Theory_of_Independence","305880868_Optimal_packings_of_bounded_degree_trees","301878306_Packing_minor-closed_families_of_graphs_into_complete_graphs","301648373_A_blow-up_lemma_for_approximate_decompositions","266977409_Packing_trees_of_bounded_diameter_into_the_complete_graph","266677172_Robust_Hamiltonicity_of_random_directed_graphs","266438363_Packing_trees_of_different_order_into_K_n"]}
