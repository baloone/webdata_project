{"id":"339768624_Tactile_Internet_Technologies_test_platforms_trials_and_applications","abstract":"In 5G, low latency and high reliability have become the most significant issues in addition to ultra-high throughput and support of massive number of devices. To achieve the goal of low latency, the concept of tactile Internet has been introduced. To reduce the latency, the various techniques, which can be applied to from the physical layer to the application layer, are needed depending on the specific application and network architecture. In this special issue, the various topics handling such issues are included.","authors":["Heejung Yu","Muhammad Khalil Afzal","Yousaf Bin Zikria","Abderrezak Rachedi"],"meta":["May 2020Future Generation Computer Systems 106:685-688","DOI:10.1016/j.future.2020.01.057"],"references":["334434726_A_Vademecum_on_Blockchain_Technologies_When_Which_and_How","332415379_Internet_of_Things_IoT_Operating_Systems_Management_Opportunities_Challenges_and_Solution","331654899_Socially-aware_congestion_control_in_ad-hoc_networks_Current_status_and_the_way_forward","331362529_Edge_computing_A_survey","330982251_Adaptive_Dynamic_Network_Slicing_in_LoRa_Networks","335512188_Optimization_of_uplink_rate_and_fronthaul_compression_in_cloud_radio_access_networks","333066618_Guest_Editorial_5G_Tactile_Internet_An_Application_for_Industrial_Automation","331617523_Towards_Immersive_Tactile_Internet_Experiences_Low-Latency_FiWi_Enhanced_Mobile_Networks_With_Edge_Intelligence_Invited","331198438_Wavelet_OFDM_with_Overlap_FDE_for_non-Gaussian_channels_in_precoded_NOMA_based_systems","331150711_IoT-enabled_smart_grid_via_SM_An_overview"]}
