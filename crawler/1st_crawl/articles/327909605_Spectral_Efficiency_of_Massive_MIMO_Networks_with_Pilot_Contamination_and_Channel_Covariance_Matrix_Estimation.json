{"id":"327909605_Spectral_Efficiency_of_Massive_MIMO_Networks_with_Pilot_Contamination_and_Channel_Covariance_Matrix_Estimation","abstract":"This study addresses spectral efficiencies (SEs) in a massive multiple-input multiple-output cellular network with pilot contamination. Both uplink and downlink SEs are investigated with practical channel state information. A downlink precoder minimising signal detection error and power leakage with considerations on spatial correlation has been derived. Also, a lowcomplexity covariance matrix estimation method has been proposed and compared with the existing estimation method in terms of normalised mean-squared error. It has been demonstrated via simulations that both uplink and downlink SEs using the proposed covariance matrix estimation method can grow with the number of antennas even with a relatively small number of pilot symbols.","authors":["Ju Liu","Xiaoqing Zhang","Shangbin Wu","Shanshan Yu"],"meta":["September 2018IET Communications 13(1)","DOI:10.1049/iet-com.2018.5032"],"references":["318799129_Pilot_contamination_is_not_a_fundamental_asymptotic_limitation_in_massive_MIMO","314160793_Superimposed_Pilots_are_Superior_for_Mitigating_Pilot_Contamination_in_Massive_MIMO","313541773_Mitigating_Pilot_Contamination_through_Location-Aware_Pilot_Assignment_in_Massive_MIMO_Networks","311612344_Massive_MIMO_with_Imperfect_Channel_Covariance_Information","311066594_Pilot_Contamination_is_Not_a_Fundamental_Asymptotic_Limitation_in_Massive_MIMO","308716531_Mitigating_Pilot_Contamination_Through_Location-Aware_Pilot_Assignment_in_Massive_MIMO_Networks","276663277_Smart_pilot_assignment_for_massive_MIMO","261423613_Spatial_orthogonality-based_pilot_reuse_for_multi-cell_massive_MIMO_transmission","260594983_Pilot_Contamination_Elimination_for_Large-Scale_Multiple-Antenna_Aided_OFDM_Systems","259845213_Low-Complexity_Polynomial_Channel_Estimation_in_Large-Scale_MIMO_With_Arbitrary_Statistics","23780738_Pilot_Contamination_and_Precoding_in_Multi-Cell_TDD_Systems","321741818_Uplink_pilot_power_control_with_genetic_algorithm_for_massive_MIMO_networks","314943590_Pilot_contamination_reduction_based_on_improved_power_control_in_M-MIMO_systems","314277366_Massive_MIMO_with_imperfect_channel_covariance_information","310824947_Optimal_Pilot_Design_for_Pilot_Contamination_EliminationReduction_in_Large-Scale_Multiple-Antenna_Aided_OFDM_Systems","299365530_Location-based_channel_estimation_and_pilot_assignment_for_massive_MIMO_systems","261233812_Pilot_contamination_precoding_in_multi-cell_large_scale_antenna_systems","260635442_Inter-Cell_Interference_in_Noncooperative_TDD_Large_Scale_Antenna_Systems","260635439_Massive_MIMO_in_the_ULDL_of_cellular_networks_How_many_antennas_do_we_need","229058210_Linear_Estimation","224180963_Noncooperative_Cellular_Wireless_with_Unlimited_Numbers_of_Base_Station_Antennas","221960626_A_Coordinated_Approach_to_Channel_Estimation_in_Large-Scale_Multiple-Antenna_Systems","221167273_Pilot_Contamination_Reduction_in_Multi-User_TDD_Systems"]}
