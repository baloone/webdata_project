{"id":"279826668_List_decoding_of_error-correcting_codes","abstract":"Error-correcting codes are combinatorial objects designed to cope with the problem of reliable transmission of information on a noisy channel. A fundamental algorithmic challenge in coding theory and practice is to efficiently decode the original transmitted message even when a few symbols of the received word are in error. The naive search algorithm runs in exponential time, and several classical polynomial time decoding algorithms are known for specific code families. Traditionally, however, these algorithms have been constrained to output a unique codeword. Thus they faced a \"combinatorial barrier\" and could only correct up to d/2 errors, where d is the minimum distance of the code. An alternate notion of decoding called list decoding, proposed independently by Elias and Wozencraft in the late 50s, allows the decoder to output a list of all codewords that differ from the received word in a certain number of positions. Even when constrained to output a relatively small number of answers, list decoding permits recovery from errors well beyond the d/2 barrier, and opens up the possibility of meaningful error-correction from large amounts of noise. However, for nearly four decades after its conception, this potential of list decoding was largely untapped due to the lack of efficient algorithms to list decode beyond d/2 errors for useful families of codes. This thesis presents a detailed investigation of list decoding, and proves its potential, feasibility, and importance as a combinatorial and algorithmic concept.","authors":["Venkatesan Guruswami"],"meta":["August 2005Lecture Notes in Computer Science 3282","DOI:10.1007/978-3-540-30180-6_1"],"references":["234832461_P_BPP_if_E_requires_exponential_circuits","227142996_BPP_has_subexponential_time_simulations_unlessEXPTIME_has_publishable_proofs","226056201_A_Tower_of_Artin_-_Schreier_Extensions_of_Function_Fields_Attaining_the_Drinfeld_-_Vladut_Bound","221591794_A_Hard-Core_Predicate_for_all_One-Way_Functions","220681700_Spherical_Codes_Generated_by_Binary_Partitions_of_Symmetric_Pointsets","220681365_Modular_curves_and_codes_with_a_polynomial_construction","220616954_Free_Bits_PCPs_and_Nonapproximability-Towards_Tight_Results","220441716_Ramanujan_Graphs","50863306_Factoring_Polynomials_with_Rational_Coefficients","3921087_Expander-based_constructions_of_efficiently_decodable_codes","3084895_Algebraic_Soft-Decision_Decoding_of_Reed-Solomon_Codes","3084657_Constructions_of_codes_from_number_fields","3084600_Hardness_of_Approximating_the_Minimum_Distance_of_a_Linear_Code","278393908_Generalized_Hamming_weights_for_linear_codes","256775258_On_the_Asymptotic_Behaviour_of_Some_Towers_of_Function_Fields_over_Finite_Fields","235008639_Hardness_vs_randomness","229755945_Modular_curves_Shimura_curves_and_Goppa_codes_better_than_Varshamov-Gilbert_Bound","225223682_Polynomial_factorization_1987-1991","223479592_A_method_for_solving_key_equation_for_decoding_Goppa_codes","223045937_Lower_bounds_to_error_probability_for_coding_on_discrete_memoryless_channels_I_II","222808307_The_Complexity_of_Computing_the_Permanent","222567962_On_the_Complexity_of_Approximating_the_VC_dimension","222474723_Factoring_multivariate_polynomials_over_finite_fields","222470866_NP_is_as_Easy_as_Detecting_Unique_Solutions","222454790_Highly_Resilient_Correctors_for_Polynomials","222448392_Decoding_Reed_Solomon_Codes_beyond_the_Error-Correction_Bound","222439945_On_a_class_of_error_correcting_binary_group_codes","222149407_Pseudorandom_Generators_without_the_XOR_Lemma","222070582_Expanders_Randomness_or_Time_versus_Space","221590464_On_the_Hardness_of_Computing_the_Permanent_of_Random_Matrices_Extended_Abstract","221499202_Simple_Constructions_of_Almost_k-Wise_Independent_Random_Variables","220684034_Linear_Diophantine_equations_over_polynomials_and_soft_decoding_of_Reed-Solomon_codes","220617681_Polynomial-Time_Reductions_from_Multivariate_to_Bi-_and_Univariate_Integral_Polynomial_Factorization","220543461_On_Polynomial-Time_Truth-Table_Reducibility_of_Intractable_Sets_to_P-Selective_Sets","220533788_Bounds_on_the_List-Decoding_Radius_of_Reed--Solomon_Codes","220431573_The_security_of_all_RSA_and_discrete_log_bits","220075158_Lower_Bound_for_the_Linear_Multiple_Packing_of_the_Binary_Hamming_Space","38367460_Orthogonal_Arrays_of_Index_Unity","38362637_On_a_Set_of_Almost_Deterministic_k-Independent_Random_Variables","29871138_Channel_Capacities_for_List_Codes","3948675_Decoding_concatenated_codes_using_soft_information","3921090_Extractors_from_Reed-Muller_codes","3880856_Soft-decision_Decoding_of_Chinese_Remainder_Codes","3801366_Computing_from_partial_solutions","3635363_Splitters_and_near-optimal_derandomization","3489306_A_New_Upper_Bound_for_Error-Correcting_Codes","3489163_Encoding_and_Error-Correction_Procedures_for_the_Bose-Chaudhuri_Codes","3488963_The_Zero-Error_Capacity_of_a_Noisy_Channel","3084901_List_Decoding_from_Erasures_Bounds_and_Code_Constructions","3084567_Improved_asymptotic_bounds_for_error-correcting_codes"]}
