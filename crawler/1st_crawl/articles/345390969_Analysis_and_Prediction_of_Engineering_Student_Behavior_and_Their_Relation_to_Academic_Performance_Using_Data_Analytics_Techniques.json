{"id":"345390969_Analysis_and_Prediction_of_Engineering_Student_Behavior_and_Their_Relation_to_Academic_Performance_Using_Data_Analytics_Techniques","abstract":"This study focuses on identifying personality traits in computer science students and\ndetermining whether they are related to academic performance. In addition, the importance of the personality traits based on motivation scale and depression, anxiety, and stress scales were measured. A sample of 188 students from the Computer Engineering Schools of the Pontifical Catholic University of Valpara√≠so was used. Through econometric two-stage least squares and paired sample correlation analysis, the results obtained indicate that there is a relation between academic performance and the personality traits measured by educational motivation scale and the ranking of university entrance and gender. In addition, these results led to characterization of students based on their personality traits and provided elements that may enhance the development of an effective personality that allows students to successfully face their environment, playing an important role in the educational process.","authors":["Hanns de la Fuente-Mella","Claudia Guzman","Kathleen Crawford","Giancarla Foschino"],"meta":["October 2020Applied Sciences 10(7114)","DOI:10.3390/app10207114"],"references":["335506418_The_Impact_of_Pedestrian_Crossing_Flags_on_Driver_Yielding_Behavior_in_Las_Vegas_NV","330919440_Analysis_of_Self-Reported_Walking_for_Transit_in_a_Sprawling_Urban_Metropolitan_Area_in_the_Western_US","316029997_Understanding_why_women_are_under-represented_in_Science_Technology_Engineering_and_Mathematics_STEM_within_Higher_Education_a_regional_case_study","307524823_Motivation_and_coping_with_the_stress_of_assessment_Gender_differences_in_outcomes_for_university_students","306215398_The_relationship_between_self-esteem_and_academic_achievementmotivation_in_university_students","339792864_Academic_Motivation_Theories_Revisited_An_Interactive_Dialog_between_Motivation_Scholars_on_Recent_Contributions_Underexplored_Issues_and_Future_Directions","332194839_Econometric_modeling_of_productivity_and_technical_efficiency_in_the_Chilean_manufacturing_industry","330906729_A_quantitative_analysis_of_the_identification_of_personality_traits_in_engineering_students_and_their_relation_to_academic_performance","321763234_Motivation_health-related_lifestyles_and_depression_among_university_students_A_longitudinal_analysis","316807278_Intrinsic_Motivation_and_Self-Determination_in_Human_Behavior"]}
