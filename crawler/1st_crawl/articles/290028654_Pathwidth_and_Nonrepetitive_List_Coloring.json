{"id":"290028654_Pathwidth_and_Nonrepetitive_List_Coloring","abstract":"A vertex coloring of a graph is nonrepetitive if there is no path in the\ngraph whose first half receives the same sequence of colors as the second half.\nWhile every tree can be nonrepetitively colored with a bounded number of colors\n(4 colors is enough), Fiorenzi, Ochem, Ossona de Mendez, and Zhu recently\nshowed that this does not extend to the list version of the problem, that is,\nfor every $\\ell \\geq 1$ there is a tree that is not nonrepetitively\n$\\ell$-choosable. In this paper we prove the following positive result, which\ncomplements the result of Fiorenzi et al.: There exists a function $f$ such\nthat every tree of pathwidth $k$ is nonrepetitively $f(k)$-choosable. We also\nshow that such a property is specific to trees by constructing a family of\npathwidth-2 graphs that are not nonrepetitively $\\ell$-choosable for any fixed\n$\\ell$.","authors":["Adam Gągol","Gwenaël Joret","Jakub Kozik","Piotr Micek"],"meta":["January 2016The Electronic Journal of Combinatorics 23(4)","DOI:10.37236/5855","SourcearXiv"],"references":["273798010_Graph_Theory","266186094_Nonrepetitive_colourings_of_planar_graphs_with_Ologn_colours","245578619_Axel_Thue''s_papers_on_repetitions_in_words_a_translation","229437983_Nonrepetitive_Choice_Number_of_Trees","227786622_Nonrepetitive_Colorings_of_Graphs","226606217_Nonrepetitive_Graph_Coloring","223411008_Pattern_avoidance_on_graphs","222704628_Nonrepetitive_colorings_of_graphs_of_bounded_tree-width","221663389_Nonrepetitive_Colourings_of_Planar_Graphs_with_Olog_n_Colours","220569364_Thue_Choosability_of_trees"]}
