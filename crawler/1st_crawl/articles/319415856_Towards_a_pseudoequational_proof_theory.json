{"id":"319415856_Towards_a_pseudoequational_proof_theory","abstract":"A new scheme for proving pseudoidentities from a given set {\\Sigma} of pseudoidentities, which is clearly sound, is also shown to be complete in many instances, such as when {\\Sigma} defines a locally finite variety, a pseudovariety of groups, more generally, of completely simple semigroups, or of commutative monoids. Many further examples when the scheme is complete are given when {\\Sigma} defines a pseudovariety V which is {\\sigma}-reducible for the equation x=y, provided {\\Sigma} is enough to prove a basis of identities for the variety of {\\sigma}-algebras generated by V. This gives ample evidence in support of the conjecture that the proof scheme is complete in general.","authors":["Jorge Almeida","Ondrej Klima"],"meta":["August 2017Portugaliae Mathematica 75(2)","DOI:10.4171/PM/2012"],"references":["310953342_The_finite_basis_and_finite_rank_properties_for_pseudovarieties_of_semigroups","301848278_On_kappa-reducibility_of_pseudovarieties_of_the_form_bf_Vbf_D","281808857_Pointlike_reducibility_of_pseudovarieties_of_the_form_bf_Vbf_D","265889081_Normal_forms_for_free_aperiodic_semigroups","262878056_McCammond's_normal_forms_for_free_aperiodic_semigroups_revisited","312204754_On_k-reducibility_of_pseudovarieties_of_V_D","301841003_Equidivisible_pseudovarieties_of_semigroups","281263195_Inevitable_graphs_A_proof_of_the_type_II_conjecture_and_some_related_decision_procedures","268541999_The_algebraic_theory_of_semigroups_Volume_1_Algebraiceskaja_teorija_polugrupp_Tom_1_Ubersetzung_aus_dem_Englischen_von_V_A_Baranskij_und_V_G_Zitomirskij_Herausgegeben_von_L_N_Shevrin","264955140_An_Introduction_to_Semigroup_Theory"]}
