{"id":"271526591_Robustness_in_the_Presence_of_Mixed_Parametric_Uncertainty_and_Unmodeled_Dynamics","abstract":"Continuing the development of the structured singular value\napproach to robust control design, the authors investigate the problem\nof computing μ in the case of mixed real parametric and complex\nuncertainty. The problem is shown to be equivalent to a smooth\nconstrained finite-dimensional optimization problem. In view of the fact\nthat the functional to be maximized may have several local extrema, an\nupper bound on μ whose computation is numerically tractable is\nestablished; this leads to a sufficient condition of robust stability\nand performance. A historical perspective on the development of the μ\ntheory is included","authors":["Michael K. H. Fan","André L.
