{"id":"353577519_Sublinear_domination_and_core-periphery_networks","abstract":"In this paper we devise a generative random network model with coreâ€“periphery properties whose core nodes act as sublinear dominators, that is, if the network has n nodes, the core has size o(n) and dominates the entire network. We show that instances generated by this model exhibit power law degree distributions, and incorporates small-world phenomena. We also fit our model in a variety of real-world networks.","authors":["Marios Papachristou"],"meta":["July 2021Scientific Reports 11(1):15528","DOI:10.1038/s41598-021-94105-8"],"references":["350701622_seaborn_statistical_data_visualization","344733489_Core-periphery_structure_in_directed_networks","339008987_SciPy_10_fundamental_algorithms_for_scientific_computing_in_Python","332358967_A_Nonlinear_Spectral_Method_for_Core--Periphery_Detection_in_Networks","276441411_Systematic_inequality_and_hierarchy_in_faculty_hiring_networks","354608969_The_dynamics_of_faculty_hiring_networks","331658430_Random_Spatial_Network_Models_for_Core-Periphery_Structure","326401298_Exploratory_Social_Network_Analysis_with_Pajek_Revised_and_Expanded_Edition_for_Updated_Software","271506703_World-Systems_Analysis","271216405_International_Trade_and_World-System_Structure_A_Multiple_Network_Analysis"]}
