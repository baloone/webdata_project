{"id":"324843220_Developing_Computational_Thinking_with_Educational_Technologies_for_Young_Learners","abstract":"The aim of this article is to provide an overview of the opportunities for developing computational thinking in young learners. It includes a review of empirical studies on the educational technologies used to develop computational thinking in young learners, and analyses and descriptions of a selection of commercially available technologies for developing computational thinking in young learners. The challenges and implications of using these technologies also are discussed.
