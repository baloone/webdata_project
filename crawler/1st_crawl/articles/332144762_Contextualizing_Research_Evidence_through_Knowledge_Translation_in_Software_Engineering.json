{"id":"332144762_Contextualizing_Research_Evidence_through_Knowledge_Translation_in_Software_Engineering","abstract":"Usage of software engineering research in industrial practice is a well-known challenge. Synthesis of knowledge from multiple research studies is needed to provide evidence-based decision-support for industry. The objective of this paper is to present a vision of how a knowledge translation framework may look like in software engineering research, in particular how to translate research evidence into practice by combining contextualized expert opinions with research evidence. We adopted the framework of knowledge translation from health care research, adapted and combined it with a Bayesian synthesis method. The framework provided in this paper includes a description of each step of knowledge translation in software engineering. Knowledge translation using Bayesian synthesis intends to provide a systematic approach towards contextualized, collaborative and consensus-driven application of research results. In conclusion, this paper contributes towards the application of knowledge translation in software engineering through the presented framework.
