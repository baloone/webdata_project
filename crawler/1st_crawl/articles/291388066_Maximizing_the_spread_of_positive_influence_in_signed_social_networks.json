{"id":"291388066_Maximizing_the_spread_of_positive_influence_in_signed_social_networks","abstract":"Influence maximization in a social network involves identifying an initial subset of nodes with a pre-defined size in order to begin the information diffusion with the objective of maximizing the influenced nodes. In this study, a sign-aware cascade (SC) model is proposed for modeling the effect of both trust and distrust relationships on activation of nodes with positive or negative opinions towards a product in the signed social networks. It is proved that positive influence maximization is NP-hard in the SC model and influence function is neither monotone nor submodular. For solving this NP-hard problem, a particle swarm optimization (PSO) method is presented which applies the random keys representation technique to convert the continuous search space of the PSO to the discrete search space of this problem. To improve the performance of this PSO method against premature convergence, a re-initialization mechanism for portion of particles with poorer fitness values and a heuristic mutation operator for global best particle are proposed. Experiments establish the effectiveness of the SC in modeling the real-world cascades. In addition, PSO method is compared with the well-known algorithms in the literature on two realworld data sets. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the compared algorithms significantly in the SC model.","authors":["Maryam Hosseini-Pozveh","Kamran Zamanifar","Ahmad Reza Naghsh-Nilchi","Peter Dolog"],"meta":["January 2016Intelligent Data Analysis 20(1):199-218","DOI:10.3233/IDA-150801","Project: prvasive computing"],"references":["261245273_Maximizing_the_Spread_of_Positive_Influence_in_Online_Social_Networks","229025007_Influence_Maximization_in_Social_Networks_When_Negative_Opinions_May_Emerge_and_Propagate","228981199_A_Task_Scheduling_Algorithm_Based_on_PSO_for_Grid_Computing","226519442_Finding_Influential_Nodes_in_a_Social_Network_from_Information_Diffusion_Data","221654678_Cost-effective_outbreak_detection_in_networks","221613674_CASINO_Towards_conformity-aware_social_influence_analysis_in_online_social_networks","221520208_Learning_influence_probabilities_in_social_networks","221022416_CELF_Optimizing_the_greedy_algorithm_for_influence_maximization_in_social_networks","4090012_Particle_swarm_optimization_algorithm_for_single_machine_total_weighted_tardiness_problem","2477877_Maximizing_the_Spread_of_Influence_through_a_Social_Network","313170517_A_modified_particle_swarm_optimizer","262175701_Discovering_influential_nodes_from_trust_network","260803730_A_global_optimization_algorithm_for_target_set_selection_problems","257391499_Identifying_influential_nodes_in_complex_networks_with_community_structure","236661639_LabelRankT_Incremental_Community_Detection_in_Dynamic_Networks_via_Label_Propagation","234839809_Constricted_Particle_Swarm_Optimization_based_Algorithm_for_Global_Optimization","224151734_A_Shapley_Value-Based_Approach_to_Discover_Influential_Nodes_in_Social_Networks","221653337_Efficient_influence_maximization_in_social_networks","220853271_A_Note_on_Maximizing_the_Spread_of_Influence_in_Social_Networks","220669338_Bean_J_Genetic_algorithms_and_random_keys_for_sequencing_and_optimization_ORSA_Journal_of_Computing_62_154-160","220618582_A_Critical_Review_of_Centrality_Measures_in_Social_Networks","220438099_Studying_Online_Social_Networks","220311802_Minimizing_the_expected_complete_influence_time_of_a_social_network","220219973_Maximizing_influence_spread_in_modular_social_networks_by_optimal_resource_allocation","200105001_Equation_of_State_by_Fast_Computing_Machines","51957083_Influence_Diffusion_Dynamics_and_Influence_Maximization_in_SocialNetworks_with_Friend_and_Foe_Relationships","4225090_An_adaptive_diversity_strategy_for_Particle_Swarm_Optimization","3623274_Particle_swarm_Optimization","2537078_Mining_Knowledge-Sharing_Sites_for_Viral_Marketing","2379126_Mining_the_Network_Value_of_Customers"]}
