{"id":"287250871_The_price_of_anarchy_and_stability_in_general_noisy_best-response_dynamics","abstract":"Logit-response dynamics (Alos-Ferrer and Netzer, Games and Economic Behavior\n2010) are a rich and natural class of noisy best-response dynamics. In this\nwork we revise the price of anarchy and the price of stability by considering\nthe quality of long-run equilibria in these dynamics. Our results show that\nprior studies on simpler dynamics of this type can strongly depend on a\nsynchronous schedule of the players' moves. In particular, a small noise by\nitself is not enough to improve the quality of equilibria as soon as other very\nnatural schedules are used.","authors":["Paolo Penna"],"meta":["September 2018International Journal of Game Theory 47(2)","DOI:10.1007/s00182-017-0601-y","SourcearXiv"],"references":["281886393_General_Revision_Protocols_in_Best_Response_Algorithms_for_Potential_Games","280104481_Multicast_Network_Design_Game_on_a_Ring","278727192_On_the_Convergence_of_Logit-Response_to_Strict_Nash_Equilibria","344846121_Logit_Dynamics_with_Concurrent_Updates_for_Local_Interaction_Potential_Games","305784772_On_the_convergence_of_logit-response_to_strict_Nash_equilibria","287251347_Tighter_Bounds_on_the_Inefficiency_Ratio_of_Stable_Equilibria_in_Load_Balancing_Games","266720514_Revisiting_log-linear_learning_Asynchrony_completeness_and_payoff-based_implementation","250305105_The_Logit-Response_Dynamics","241756668_Learning_Efficient_Nash_Equilibria_in_Distributed_Systems","229076069_Logit_Dynamics_with_Concurrent_Updates_for_Local-Interaction_Games","226999964_Atomic_Congestion_Games_Fast_Myopic_and_Concurrent","224216574_Revisiting_log-linear_learning_Asynchrony_completeness_and_payoff-based_implementation","221591524_Multiplicative_Updates_Outperform_Generic_No-Regret_Learning_in_Congestion_Games","226219033_A_linear_time_approximation_algorithm_for_multiprocessor_scheduling","222302283_Worst-Case_Equilibria"]}
