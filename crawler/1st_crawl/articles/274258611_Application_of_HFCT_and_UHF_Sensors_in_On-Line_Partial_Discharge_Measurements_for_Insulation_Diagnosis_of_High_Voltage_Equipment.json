Different PD measuring techniques have been developed in the last years specially designed to perform on-line measurements. Non-conventional PD methods operating in high frequency bands are usually used when this type of tests are carried out. In PD measurements the signal acquisition, the subsequent signal processing and the capability to obtain an accurate diagnosis are conditioned by the selection of a suitable detection technique and by the implementation of effective signal processing tools. This paper proposes an optimized electromagnetic detection method based on the combined use of wideband PD sensors for measurements performed in the HF and UHF frequency ranges, together with the implementation of powerful processing tools. The effectiveness of the measuring techniques proposed is demonstrated through an example, where several PD sources are measured simultaneously in a HV installation consisting of a cable system connected by a plug-in terminal to a gas insulated substation (GIS) compartment.","authors":["Fernando Álvarez","Fernando Garnacho","Javier Ortego","Miguel Ángel Sánchez-Urán"],"meta":["April 2015Sensors 15(4):7360-87","DOI:10.3390/s150407360","SourcePubMed","Project: Partial discharge measuremnts in HV installations"],"references":["262304759_A_fiber_optic_PD_sensor_using_a_balanced_Sagnac_interferometer_and_an_EDFA-Based_DOP_Tunable_fiber_ring_laser","260535456_Development_Simulation_and_Experiment_Study_on_UHF_Partial_Discharge_Sensor_in_GIS","260370872_Inductive_Sensor_Performance_in_Partial_Discharges_and_Noise_Separation_by_Means_of_Spectral_Power_Ratios","258120850_Partial_Discharge_and_Noise_Separation_by_Means_of_Spectral-Power_Clustering_Techniques","231072789_Partial_discharge_current_pulses_in_SF6_and_the_effect_of_superposition_of_their_radiometric_measurement","273172045_High-Voltage_Test_Techniques_-_Partial_Discharge_Measurements","255594057_Induction_coil_sensors-A_review","254058409_Study_of_Partial_Discharge_Charge_Evaluation_and_the_Associated_Uncertainty_by_Means_of_High_Frequency_Current_Transformers","252062583_Influence_of_High_Frequency_Current_Transformers_Bandwidth_on_Charge_Evaluation_in_Partial_Discharge_Measurements","232653374_Study_of_GIS_Partial_Discharge_On-line_Monitoring_Using_UHF_Method"]}
