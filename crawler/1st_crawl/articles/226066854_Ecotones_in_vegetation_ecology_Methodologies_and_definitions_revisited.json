{"id":"226066854_Ecotones_in_vegetation_ecology_Methodologies_and_definitions_revisited","abstract":"In this review paper, we highlight some of the trends and issues that have dominated ecotone research over the decade of 1996–2006.\nThe terms and definitions of ecotone research in vegetation ecology are reviewed. We summarize the most important techniques\nand highlight the discrepancies between the definitions and their scientific application in vegetation ecology. We see a need\nfor semantic uniformity with regard to the term and the definition of “the ecotone”, as the variable and the non-exclusive\nuse of terms and definitions can be a source of confusion when interpreting and comparing different studies. To avoid further\nconfusion, a unique definition of the term “ecotone” should be agreed upon, based upon a set of general characteristics. We\ntherefore adapted and extended the definition from Holland etal. (Ecotones: the role of landscape boundaries in the management\nand restoration of changing environments, 1991) to “A multi-dimensional environmentally stochastic interaction zone between\necological systems with characteristics defined in space and time, and by the strength of the interaction”. We also advocate\nthat (1) a shift in focus from one-dimensional to two-dimensional techniques in ecotone characterization is desirable and\n(2) more research into novel techniques, including multi-dimensional data and time series, is needed in view of local and\nglobal ecotone changes.","authors":["Koen Hufkens","Paul Scheunders","Reinhart Ceulemans"],"meta":["September 2009Ecological Research 24(5):977-986","DOI:10.1007/s11284-009-0584-7"],"references":["321604789_Ecotones_The_Role_of_Landscape_Boundaries_in_the_Management_and_Restoration_of_Changing_Environments","318849059_Orloci_L_and_M_Orloci_1990_Edge_detection_in_vegetation_Jornada_revisited_Journal_of_Vegetation_Science_1311-324","313082431_Categorical_wombling_Detecting_regions_of_significant_change_in_spatially_located_categorical_variables","289256628_Plant_distribution_pattern_across_the_forest-tundra_ecotone_The_importance_of_treeline_position","284260576_A_new_look_at_ecotones_Emerging_international_projects_on_landscape_boundaries","278600309_Effects_of_Data_Types_on_Vegetation_Boundary_Delineation","274191777_Ecotones--The_Role_of_Landscape_Boundaries_in_the_Management_and_Restoration_of_Changing_Environments","273230139_Ordination_Methods_in_Ecology","273054695_Dynamics_and_Forms_of_Ecotone_of_Under_the_Impact_of_Climatic_Change_Mathematical_Approach","272662444_Ecotones_at_Local_to_Regional_Scales_from_Around_the_World"]}
