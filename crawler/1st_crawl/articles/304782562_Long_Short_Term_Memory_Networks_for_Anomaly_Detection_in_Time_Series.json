{"id":"304782562_Long_Short_Term_Memory_Networks_for_Anomaly_Detection_in_Time_Series","abstract":"Long Short Terma Memory (LSTM) Networks have been demonstrated to be particularly useful for learning sequences containing longer term patterns of unknown length, due to their ability to maintain long term memory. Stacking recurrent hidden layers in such networks also enables the learning of higher level temporal features, for faster learning with sparser representations. In this paper, we use stacked LSTM networks for anomaly/fault detection in time series. A network is trained on non-anomalous data and used as a predictor over a number of time steps. The resulting prediction errors are modeled as a multivariate Gaussian distribution, which is used to assess the likelihood of anomalous behavior. The efficacy of this approach is demonstrated on four datasets: ECG, space shuttle, power demand, and multi-sensor engine dataset.","authors":["Pankaj Malhotra","Lovekesh Vig","Gautam Shroff","Puneet Agarwal"],"meta":["April 2015","Conference: 23rd European Symposium on Artificial Neural Networks, Computational Intelligence and Machine Learning, ESANN 2015At: Bruges, Belgium","Project: Time Series Anomaly Detection"],"references":["221653780_Online_novelty_detection_on_temporal_sequences","13853244_Long_Short-term_Memory","6549209_Static_and_dynamic_novelty_detection_methods_for_jet_engine_health_monitoring","310604250_Training_and_analysing_deep_recurrent_neural_networks","285228693_Training_and_analysing_deep_recurrent_neural_networks","269500408_Detection_of_Abrupt_Changes_Theory_and_Applications","235410061_How_the_Brain_Might_Work_A_Hierarchical_and_Temporal_Model_for_Learning_and_Recognition"]}
