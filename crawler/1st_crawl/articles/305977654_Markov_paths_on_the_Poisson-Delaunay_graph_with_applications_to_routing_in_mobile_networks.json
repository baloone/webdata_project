{"id":"305977654_Markov_paths_on_the_Poisson-Delaunay_graph_with_applications_to_routing_in_mobile_networks","abstract":"Consider the Delaunay graph and the Voronoi tessellation constructed with respect to a Poisson point process. The sequence of nuclei of the Voronoi cells that are crossed by a line defines a path on the Delaunay graph. We show that the evolution of this path is governed by a Markov chain. We study the ergodic properties of the chain and find its stationary distribution. As a corollary, we obtain the ratio of the mean path length to the Euclidean distance between the end points, and hence a bound for the mean asymptotic length of the shortest path.\nWe apply these results to define a family of simple incremental algorithms for constructing short paths on the Delaunay graph and discuss potential applications to routeing in mobile communication networks.","authors":["Fran√ßois Baccelli","K.
