{"id":"334858150_Variants_of_P_systems_with_activation_and_blocking_of_rules","abstract":"We introduce new possibilities to control the application of rules based on the preceding applications, which can be defined in a general way for (hierarchical) P systems and the main known derivation modes. Computational completeness can be obtained even with non-cooperative rules and using both activation and blocking of rules, especially for the set modes of derivation, when allowing derivation steps with no rules being applied. When we allow the application of rules to influence the application of rules in previous derivation steps, applying a non-conservative semantics for what we consider to be a valid infinite derivation, we can even “go beyond Turing”.","authors":["Artiom Alhazov","Rudolf Freund","Sergiu Ivanov"],"meta":["September 2019Natural Computing 18(1–3)","DOI:10.1007/s11047-019-09747-5"],"references":["313806055_P_Systems_Working_in_Maximal_Variants_of_the_Set_Derivation_Mode","267675241_Sequential_P_Systems_with_Regular_Control","344520881_Regulated_Rewriting_in_Formal_Language_Theory","326565936_P_Systems_with_Randomized_Right-hand_Sides_of_Rules","325459235_P_Systems_with_Activation_and_Blocking_of_Rules","303572882_Going_beyond_Turing_with_P_automata_Regular_observer_o-languages_and_partial_adult_halting","300559492_Going_Beyond_Turing_with_P_Automata_Partial_Adult_Halting_and_Regular_Observer_o-Languages","292570278_Membrane_computing_15th_international_conference_CMC_2014_Prague_Czech_Republic_august_20-22_2014_revised_selected_papers","280752332_Polymorphic_P_Systems_with_Non-cooperative_Rules_and_No_Ingredients","268054690_Regulated_rewriting_in_formel_language_theory"]}
