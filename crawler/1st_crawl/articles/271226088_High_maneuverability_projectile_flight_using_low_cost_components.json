{"id":"271226088_High_maneuverability_projectile_flight_using_low_cost_components","abstract":"This paper examines the problem of enhancing maneuverability of gun-launched munitions utilizing low cost technologies. Two ideas are proposed for reducing cost: (1) designing algorithms that reduce the sensor or actuator burden, and (2) performing high fidelity modeling and simulation of the entire system with realistic data input. The fundamental theory underpinning guided projectile flight systems, including nonlinear equations of motion for projectile flight, aerodynamic modeling, actuator dynamics, and measurement modeling, is outlined. Manipulation of these nonlinear models into linear system models enables airframe stability investigation and flight control design. A basic framework for low cost guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) of high maneuverability projectiles is formulated. Theory was implemented in simulation and exercised for a guided projectile system. Results support the hypothesis that algorithms can compensate for poor actuator performance and identified critical trade study parameters. Monte Carlo analysis indicated that the cost associated with measurements of a threshold accuracy rather than actuation technologies prescribes guided system performance.","authors":["Frank Fresconi","Ilmars Celmins","Sidra Silton","Mark Costello"],"meta":["February 2015Aerospace Science and Technology 41","DOI:10.1016/j.ast.2014.12.007"],"references":["225075468_Feedback_Control_Of_Dynamic_Systems","281510825_Flight_mechanics_of_a_novel_guided_spin-stabilized_projectile_concept","281477365_Excalibur_New_precision_engagement_asset_in_the_warfight","274133221_Guidance_and_Control_of_a_Projectile_with_Reduced_Sensor_and_Actuator_Requirements","270050118_Agile_Missile_Dynamics_and_Control","269565091_Robust_Roll_Autopilot_Design_for_Tactical_Missiles","268557006_Flight_Mechanics_of_a_Novel_Guided_Spin-Stabilized_Projectile_Concept","261718826_Modern_Exterior_Ballistics_The_Launch_and_Flight_Dynamics_of_Symmetric_Projectiles","247696878_Tactical_and_Strategic_Missile_Guidance","245431847_Comparison_of_classical_and_modern_missile_autopilot_design_and_analysis_techniques","245431371_Why_modern_controllers_can_go_unstable_in_practice","243782496_A_Controller_to_Overcome_Dead_Time","239415680_Guidance_and_Control_of_a_Cannon-Launched_Guided_Projectile","239415071_Roll-Pitch-Yaw_Integrated_Robust_Autopilot_Design_for_a_High_Angle-of-Attack_Missile","238176871_Agile_Missile_Dynamics_and_Control","235198348_Dynamics_of_Atmospheric_Flight","235190989_FREE_FLIGHT_MOTION_OF_SYMMETRIC_MISSILES","235070115_Addressing_the_Challenges_of_a_Thruster-Based_Precision_Guided_Mortar_Munition_With_the_Use_of_Embedded_Telemetry_Instrumentation","235055369_Guidance_and_Control_of_a_Fin-Stabilized_Projectile_Based_on_Flight_Dynamics_with_Reduced_Sensor_and_Actuator_Requirements","234360884_A_combined_optimalclassical_approach_to_robust_missile_autopilot_design","224388432_Modern_Control_Theory_for_Design_of_Autopilots_for_Bank-to-Turn_Missiles"]}
