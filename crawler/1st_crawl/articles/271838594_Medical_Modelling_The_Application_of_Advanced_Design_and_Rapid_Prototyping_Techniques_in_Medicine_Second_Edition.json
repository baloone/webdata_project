{"id":"271838594_Medical_Modelling_The_Application_of_Advanced_Design_and_Rapid_Prototyping_Techniques_in_Medicine_Second_Edition","abstract":"Medical modelling and the principles of medical imaging, Computer Aided Design (CAD) and Rapid Prototyping (also known as Additive Manufacturing and 3D Printing) are important techniques relating to various disciplines - from biomaterials engineering to surgery. Building on the success of the first edition, Medical Modelling: The application of Advanced Design and Rapid Prototyping techniques in medicine provides readers with a revised edition of the original text, along with key information on innovative imaging techniques, Rapid Prototyping technologies and case studies.\nFollowing an overview of medical imaging for Rapid Prototyping, the book goes on to discuss working with medical scan data and techniques for Rapid Prototyping. In this second edition there is an extensive section of peer-reviewed case studies, describing the practical applications of advanced design technologies in surgical, prosthetic, orthotic, dental and research applications.","authors":["Dominic Eggbeer","Richard Bibb","Abby Megan Paterson"],"meta":["February 2015","Edition: 2Publisher: ElsevierEditor: Bibb R, Eggbeer D, Paterson AISBN:
