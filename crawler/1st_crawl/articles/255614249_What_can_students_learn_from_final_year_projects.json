{"id":"255614249_What_can_students_learn_from_final_year_projects","abstract":"Final year research projects are a feature of most biosciences undergraduate courses. However, in a climate of increasing student numbers there is growing interest in providing alternatives to such resource-intensive projects. This interest raises some key questions. In particular, what do students learn from traditional final year projects and can alternative teaching activities be found to achieve all or some of these learning aims? This report follows from a recent Learning and Teaching Support Network (LTSN) Biosciences workshop held in the UK: 'Alternative Final Year Projects'. At the start of the workshop results from an educational research study were used to present a characterisation of student learning on 'traditional' final year research projects. This report summarises these findings and aims to promote a broad discussion about what traditional projects achieve, and what alternatives might be able to offer.","authors":["Jim Ryder"],"meta":["November 2004Bioscience Education e-Journal 4","DOI:10.3108/beej.2004.04000003"],"references":["229859141_Undergraduate_science_students'_images_of_science"]}
