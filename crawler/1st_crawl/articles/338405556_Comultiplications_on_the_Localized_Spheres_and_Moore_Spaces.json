{"id":"338405556_Comultiplications_on_the_Localized_Spheres_and_Moore_Spaces","abstract":"Any nilpotent CW-space can be localized at primes in a similar way to the localization of a ring at a prime number. For a collection P of prime numbers which may be empty and a localization X P of a nilpotent CW-space X at P , we let | C ( X ) | and | C ( X P ) | be the cardinalities of the sets of all homotopy comultiplications on X and X P , respectively. In this paper, we show that if | C ( X ) | is finite, then | C ( X ) | ≥ | C ( X P ) | , and if | C ( X ) | is infinite, then | C ( X ) | = | C ( X P ) | , where X is the k-fold wedge sum ⋁ i = 1 k S n i or Moore spaces M ( G , n ) . Moreover, we provide examples to concretely determine the cardinality of homotopy comultiplications on the k-fold wedge sum of spheres, Moore spaces, and their localizations.","authors":["Dae-Woong Lee"],"meta":["January 2020","DOI:10.3390/math8010086"],"references":["337298441_The_Topological_Transversality_Theorem_for_Multivalued_Maps_with_Continuous_Selections","334730792_Algebraic_loop_structures_on_algebra_comultiplications","314981629_Comultiplication_structures_for_awedge_of_spheres","330250828_Homotopy_comultiplications_on_the_k-fold_wedge_of_spheres","319643134_The_representation-ring-graded_local_cohomology_spectral_sequence_for_BPR3","303657372_Binary_Operations_for_Homotopy_Groups_with_Coefficients","284953931_Co-H-spaces","271898514_On_the_generalized_same_N-type_conjecture","268017564_Comultiplications_of_the_Wedge_of_Two_Moore_Spaces","267466127_Geometric_topology_Localization_periodicity_and_Galois_symmetry_The_1970_MIT_Notes_Edited_by_A_Ranicki"]}
