{"id":"282906519_On_the_Classes_of_Interval_Graphs_of_Limited_Nesting_and_Count_of_Lengths","abstract":"In 1969, Roberts introduced proper and unit interval graphs and proved that\nthese classes are equal. Natural generalizations of the second class were\nconsidered in which the number of different lengths of intervals is limited by\nk. Not much is known about them and the long-standing open problem asks how\nhard is recognition even for k=2. In this paper, we show that a generalization\nof recognition called partial representation extension is NP-hard even for k=2,\nwhile a quadratic-time algorithm is known for unit interval graphs.\nWe propose generalizations of proper interval graphs called k-nested interval\ngraphs in which there are no chains of k+1 intervals nested in each other. We\ngive a linear-time algorithm for recognition and a polynomial-time algorithm\nfor partial representation extension. These results extend a list of examples,\nwhere problems involving geometry (k lengths) are much harder than similar\nproblems involving topology (nesting k).","authors":["Pavel Klavík","Yota Otachi","Jiří Šejnoha"],"meta":["April 2019Algorithmica 81(2)","DOI:10.1007/s00453-018-0481-y","SourcearXiv"],"references":["315765100_On_the_thinness_and_proper_thinness_of_a_graph","338524990_Minimal_Obstructions_for_Partial_Representations_of_Interval_Graphs","320761943_Extending_Partial_Representations_of_Trapezoid_Graphs","317356768_Extending_Partial_Representations_of_Unit_Circular-arc_Graphs","315947574_Bounded_minimal_and_short_representations_of_unit_interval_and_unit_circular-arc_graphs_Chapter_II_Algorithms","312442198_Indifference_graphs_A_characterization_of_comparability_graphs_and_of_interval_graphs","308847274_FO_Model_Checking_on_Posets_of_Bounded_Width","305627349_Extending_Partial_Representations_of_Interval_Graphs","305476913_Extending_Partial_Representations_of_Proper_and_Unit_Interval_Graphs","303009009_FO_Model_Checking_of_Interval_Graphs"]}
