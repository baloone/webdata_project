{"id":"271771342_Codes_for_DNA_Sequence_Profiles","abstract":"We consider the problem of storing and retrieving information from synthetic\nDNA media. The mathematical basis of the problem is the construction and design\nof sequences that may be discriminated based on their collection of substrings\nobserved through a noisy channel. This problem of reconstructing sequences from\ntraces was first investigated in the noiseless setting under the name of\n\"Markov type\" analysis. Here, we explain the connection between the\nreconstruction problem and the problem of DNA synthesis and sequencing, and\nintroduce the notion of a DNA storage channel. We analyze the number of\nsequence equivalence classes under the channel mapping and propose new\nasymmetric coding techniques to combat the effects of synthesis and sequencing\nnoise. In our analysis, we make use of restricted de Bruijn graphs and Ehrhart\ntheory for rational polytopes.","authors":["Han Mao Kiah","Gregory J.
