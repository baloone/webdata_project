{"id":"221580449_On_Span_Programs","abstract":"A linear algebraic model of computation the span program, is\nintroduced, and several upper and lower bounds on it are proved. These\nresults yield applications in complexity and cryptography. The proof of\nthe main connection, between span programs and counting branching\nprograms, uses a variant of Razborov's general approximation\nmethod","authors":["Mauricio Karchmer","Avi Wigderson"],"meta":["January 1993","DOI:10.1109/SCT.1993.336536","SourceDBLP","Conference: Structure in Complexity Theory Conference, 1993., Proceedings of the Eighth Annual"],"references":["242100641_The_Complexity_of_Finite_Functions","4354798_Random_Walks_Universal_Traversal_Sequences_and_the_Complexity_of_Maze_Problems","246732743_Lower_bounds_on_the_size_of_switching-and-recti_er_networks_for_symmetric_Boolean_functions","238697958_Lower_bounds_on_the_size_of_bounded_depth_networks_over_a_complete_basis_with_logical_addition","234532093_Complexity_of_Contact_Circuits_Realizing_a_Function_of_Logical_Algebra","227296549_Applications_of_matrix_methods_to_the_theory_of_lower_bounds_in_computational_complexity","227037302_A_combinatorial_approach_to_complexity","227029336_Lower_bounds_of_the_complexity_of_symmetric_boolean_functions_of_contact-rectifier_circuits","226375948_Lower_bounds_on_the_size_of_bounded_depth_circuits_over_a_complete_basis_with_logical_addition","222470866_NP_is_as_Easy_as_Detecting_Unique_Solutions","221590779_On_the_Method_of_Approximations","221590182_Algebraic_Methods_in_the_Theory_of_Lower_Bounds_for_Boolean_Circuit_Complexity","221590118_Characterizing_non-deterministic_circuit_size","220854895_Two_remarks_on_the_power_of_counting","220543962_Structure_and_Importance_of_Logspace-MOD_Class","220425267_How_to_Share_a_Secret","220155059_Lower_Bounds_to_the_Complexity_of_Symmetric_Boolean_Functions","220152867_On_the_Construction_of_Parallel_Computers_from_Various_Bases_of_Boolean_Functions","3501871_On_the_computational_power_of_PP_and_P","3501855_Note_on_the_power_of_threshold_circuits"]}
