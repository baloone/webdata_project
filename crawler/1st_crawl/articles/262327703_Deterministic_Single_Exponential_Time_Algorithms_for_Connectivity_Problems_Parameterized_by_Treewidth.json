{"id":"262327703_Deterministic_Single_Exponential_Time_Algorithms_for_Connectivity_Problems_Parameterized_by_Treewidth","abstract":"It is well known that many local graph problems, like Vertex Cover and Dominating Set, can be solved in \\(2^{\\mathcal{O}(\\mathtt{tw})}n^{\\mathcal{O}(1)}\\) time for graphs with a given tree decomposition of width tw. However, for nonlocal problems, like the fundamental class of connectivity problems, for a long time it was unknown how to do this faster than \\(\\mathtt{tw}^{\\mathcal{O}(\\mathtt{tw})}n^{\\mathcal{O}(1)}\\) until recently, when Cygan et al. (FOCS 2011) introduced the Cut&Count technique that gives randomized algorithms for a wide range of connectivity problems running in time \\(c^{\\mathtt{tw}}n^{\\mathcal{O}(1)}\\) for a small constant c.\nIn this paper, we show that we can improve upon the Cut&Count technique in multiple ways, with two new techniques. The first technique (rank-based approach) gives deterministic algorithms with O(c\ntw\nn) running time for connectivity problems (like Hamiltonian Cycle and Stei-ner Tree) and for weighted variants of these; the second technique (determinant approach) gives deterministic algorithms running in time \\(c^{\\mathtt{tw}}n^{\\mathcal{O}(1)}\\) for counting versions, e.g., counting the number of Hamiltonian cycles for graphs of treewidth tw.\nThe rank-based approach introduces a new technique to speed up dynamic programming algorithms which is likely to have more applications. The determinant-based approach uses the Matrix Tree Theorem for deriving closed formulas for counting versions of connectivity problems; we show how to evaluate those formulas via dynamic programming.","authors":["Hans L.
