{"id":"235774442_Inter-_and_Intra-Operator_Reliability_and_Repeatability_of_Shear_Wave_Elastography_in_the_Liver_A_Study_in_Healthy_Volunteers","abstract":"This study assessed the reproducibility of shear wave elastography (SWE) in the liver of healthy volunteers. Intra- and inter-operator reliability and repeatability were quantified in three different liver segments in a sample of 15 subjects, scanned during four independent sessions (two scans on day 1, two scans 1 wk later) by two operators. A total of 1440 measurements were made. Reproducibility was assessed using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and a repeated measures analysis of variance. The shear wave speed was measured and used to estimate Young's modulus using the Supersonics Imagine Aixplorer. The median Young's modulus measured through the inter-costal space was 5.55 Â± 0.74 kPa. The intra-operator reliability was better for same-day evaluations (ICC = 0.91) than the inter-operator reliability (ICC = 0.78). Intra-observer agreement decreased when scans were repeated on a different day. Inter-session repeatability was between 3.3% and 9.9% for intra-day repeated scans, compared with to 6.5%-12% for inter-day repeated scans. No significant difference was observed in subjects with a body mass index greater or less than 25 kg/m2.","authors":["John M Hudson","Laurent Milot","Craig Parry","Ross Williams"],"meta":["February 2013Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology 39(6)","DOI:10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2012.12.011","SourcePubMed"],"references":["232742286_Checkmate_to_liver_biopsy_in_chronic_hepatitis_C","232568057_Forming_Inferences_About_Some_Intraclass_Correlation_Coefficients","221781931_Shear-wave_Elastography_Improves_the_Specificity_of_Breast_US_The_BE1_Multinational_Study_of_939_Masses","51973725_Shear_wave_elastography_for_breast_masses_is_highly_reproducible","46305113_Diagnostic_accuracy_of_FibroScan_and_comparison_to_liver_fibrosis_biomarkers_in_chronic_viral_hepatitis_A_multicenter_prospective_study_the_FIBROSTIC_study","26693455_Validation_of_SMURF_Estimation_of_Shear_Modulus_in_Hydrogels","11836341_On_the_feasibility_of_remote_palpation_using_acoustic_radiation_force","8565554_Supersonic_Shear_Imaging_a_new_technique_for_soft_tissue_elasticity_mapping","6549377_Reproducibility_of_transient_elastography_in_the_evaluation_of_liver_fibrosis_in_patients_with_chronic_liver_disease","306370953_Reproducibility_and_Validity_Studies_of_Diagnostic_Procedures_in_ManualMusculoskeletal_Medicine_Protocol_formats_2nd_Edition","246350639_Guidelines_for_Evaluating_and_Expressing_the_Uncertainty_of_NIST_Measurement_Results","228035940_Pain_experienced_during_percutaneous_liver_biopsy","51507613_Noninvasive_In_Vivo_Liver_Fibrosis_Evaluation_Using_Supersonic_Shear_Imaging_A_Clinical_Study_on_113_Hepatitis_C_Virus_Patients","51250321_Reproducibility_of_Shear_Wave_Velocity_Measurements_by_Acoustic_Radiation_Force_Impulse_Imaging_of_the_Liver_A_Study_in_Healthy_Volunteers","51071997_Guidelines_for_Reporting_Reliability_and_Agreement_Studies_GRRAS_were_proposed","49776222_Noninvasive_Evaluation_of_Hepatic_Fibrosis_using_Acoustic_Radiation_Force-Based_Shear_Stiffness_in_Patients_with_Nonalcoholic_Fatty_Liver_Disease","49657094_Guidelines_for_Reporting_Reliability_and_Agreement_Studies_GRRAS_were_proposed","44691272_Tissue_Quantification_With_Acoustic_Radiation_Force_Impulse_Imaging_Measurement_Repeatability_and_Normal_Values_in_the_Healthy_Liver","24400032_Variability_in_liver_stiffness_values_from_different_intercostal_spaces","24041288_Shear_Wave_Spectroscopy_for_In_Vivo_Quantification_of_Human_Soft_Tissues_Visco-Elasticity","23662476_Quantitative_Viscoelasticity_Mapping_of_Human_Liver_Using_Supersonic_Shear_Imaging_Preliminary_In_Vivo_Feasability_Study","23460340_Reproducibility_of_Liver_Stiffness_Measurement_by_Ultrasonographic_Elastometry","23303932_Intraclass_correlations_Uses_in_assessing_rater_reliability","18605092_Pathological_characteristics_of_experimental_thermal_lesions_Comparison_of_induction_heating_and_radiofrequency_electrocoagulation","12158562_Liver_Biopsy","11429208_Acoustic_radiation_force_impulse_imaging_In_vivo_demonstration_of_clinical_feasibility","8046037_Prospective_comparison_of_transient_elastography_Fibrotest_APRI_and_liver_biopsy_for_the_assessment_of_fibrosis_in_chronic_hepatitis_C","6130549_Noninvasive_diagnosis_of_hepatic_fibrosis_in_chronic_hepatitis_C","5629840_Quantifying_Hepatic_Shear_Modulus_In_Vivo_Using_Acoustic_Radiation_Force","5546649_Reliability_repeatability_and_reproducibility_Analysis_of_measurement_errors_in_continuous_variables","5518527_A_Non-invasive_evaluation_of_liver_fibrosis_using_transient_elastography","5456652_Quantitative_Assessment_of_Breast_Lesion_Viscoelasticity_Initial_Clinical_Results_Using_Supersonic_Shear_Imaging"]}
