{"id":"282333233_Automatic_Software_Repair_A_Bibliography","abstract":"This article presents a survey on automatic software repair. Automatic software repair consists of automatically finding a solution to software bugs without human intervention. This article considers all kinds of repairs. First, it discusses behavioral repair where test suites, contracts, models, and crashing inputs are taken as oracle. Second, it discusses state repair, also known as runtime repair or runtime recovery, with techniques such as checkpoint and restart, reconfiguration, and invariant restoration. The uniqueness of this article is that it spans the research communities that contribute to this body of knowledge: software engineering, dependability, operating systems, programming languages, and security. It provides a novel and structured overview of the diversity of bug oracles and repair operators used in the literature.","authors":["Martin Monperrus"],"meta":["January 2015ACM Computing Surveys 51(1)","DOI:10.1145/3105906"],"references":["318873696_Principles_of_Antifragile_Software","309450255_Automatic_Repair_of_Real_Bugs_in_Java_A_Large-Scale_Experiment_on_the_Defects4J_Dataset","346365331_Rx_treating_bugs_as_allergies---a_safe_method_to_survive_software_failures","340423534_Sound_input_filter_generation_for_integer_overflow_errors","319770821_Detecting_and_Escaping_Infinite_Loops_with_Jolt","313057727_Using_automated_fix_generation_to_secure_SQL_statements","310821492_Understanding_and_generating_high_quality_patches_for_concurrency_bugs","308858592_Safe_Memory-Leak_Fixing_for_C_Programs","308543177_Improved_Crossover_Operators_for_Genetic_Programming_for_Program_Repair","305252944_Qlose_Program_Repair_with_Quantitative_Objectives"]}
