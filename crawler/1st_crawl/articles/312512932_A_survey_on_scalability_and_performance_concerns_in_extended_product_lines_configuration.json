{"id":"312512932_A_survey_on_scalability_and_performance_concerns_in_extended_product_lines_configuration","abstract":"Product lines have been employed as a mass customisation method that reduces production costs and time-to-market. Multiple product variants are represented in a product line, however the selection of a particular configuration depends on stakeholders' functional and non-functional requirements. Methods like constraint programming and evolutionary algorithms have been used to support the configuration process. They consider a set of product requirements like resource constraints, stakeholders' preferences, and optimization objectives. Nevertheless, scalability and performance concerns start to be an issue when facing large-scale product lines and runtime environments. Thus, this paper presents a survey that analyses strengths and drawbacks of 21 approaches that support product line configuration. This survey aims to: i) evidence which product requirements are currently supported by studied methods; ii) how scalability and performance is considered in existing approaches; and iii) point out some challenges to be addressed in future research.","authors":["Lina Ochoa","Juliana Alves Pereira","Oscar Gonz√°lez-Rojas","Harold Castro"],"meta":["February 2017","DOI:10.1145/3023956.3023959","Conference: the Eleventh International Workshop","Project: cloud architectures"],"references":["308735712_Multi-Objective_Test_Case_Prioritization_in_Highly_Configurable_Systems_A_Case_Study","299544987_SIP_Optimal_Product_Selection_from_Feature_Models_Using_Many-Objective_Evolutionary_Optimization","281584480_Combining_Multi-Objective_Search_and_Constraint_Solving_for_Configuring_Large_Software_Product_Lines","259231432_Constraints_The_Heart_of_Domain_and_Application_Engineering_in_the_Product_Lines_Engineering_Strategy","226664976_Automated_Reasoning_on_Feature_Models","223760542_Automated_analysis_of_feature_models_20_years_later_A_literature_review","222673849_Systematic_literature_reviews_in_software_engineering-A_systematic_literature_review","221228592_On_the_Effect_of_the_Steady-State_Selection_Scheme_in_Multi-Objective_Genetic_Algorithms","221228482_FastPGA_A_Dynamic_Population_Sizing_Approach_for_Solving_Expensive_Multiobjective_Optimization_Problems","220740661_Optimal_antenna_placement_using_a_new_multi-objective_chc_algorithm","220327549_Automatically_Composing_Reusable_Software_Components_for_Mobile_Devices","220306683_Solutions_for_product_configuration_management_An_empirical_study","215747934_SPL_Conqueror_Toward_Optimization_of_Non-functional_Properties_in_Software_Product_Lines","309363021_A_feature-based_personalized_recommender_system_for_product-line_configuration","308836425_Automating_Resource_Selection_and_Configuration_in_Inter-clouds_through_a_Software_Product_Line_Method","308671142_SPL-TQSSS_A_Software_Product_Line_Approach_for_Stateful_Service_Selection","308118408_Using_decision_rules_for_solving_conflicts_in_extended_feature_models","300204871_Optimizing_selection_of_competing_features_via_feedback-directed_evolutionary_algorithms","288492280_Comparison_of_exact_and_approximate_multi-objective_optimization_for_software_product_lines","281717761_Optimized_feature_selection_towards_functional_and_non-functional_requirements_in_Software_Product_Lines","264900540_Reliability_Estimation_for_Component-Based_Software_Product_Lines","262255712_Modelling_and_multi-objective_optimization_of_quality_attributes_in_variability-rich_software","261192670_On_the_value_of_user_preferences_in_search-based_software_engineering_A_case_study_in_software_product_lines","261185442_Toward_Automated_Feature_Model_Configuration_With_Optimizing_Non-Functional_Requirements","258770465_Evolving_feature_model_configurations_in_software_product_lines","251983212_A_preliminary_experimental_study_on_optimal_feature_selection_for_product_derivation_using_knapsack_approximation","222297725_Selecting_highly_optimal_architectural_feature_sets_with_Filtered_Cartesian_Flattening","220789653_Stratified_Analytic_Hierarchy_Process_Prioritization_and_Selection_of_Software_Features","220377540_A_genetic_algorithm_for_optimized_feature_selection_with_resource_constraints_in_software_product_lines","220063602_MOCell_A_cellular_genetic_algorithm_for_multiobjective_optimization","216457303_Indicator-Based_Selection_in_Multiobjective_Search","216301720_SPEA2_Improving_the_Strength_Pareto_Evolutionary_Algorithm_for_Multiobjective_Optimization","216300449_Evolutionary_Algorithms_for_Solving_Multi-Objective_Problems_Second_Edition","3418687_A_fast_and_elitist_multiobjective_genetic_algorithm_NSGA-II"]}
