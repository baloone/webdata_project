{"id":"320495856_A_testing_system_for_a_real-time_gesture_classification_using_surface_EMG","abstract":"This study addresses the development of a testing system for pattern-recognition-based strategies of myoelectric control. This text describes the structure and components of the proposed system, as well as a process of its testing. The latter included an acquisition of an accompanying EMG, using Myo™ armband by Thalmic Labs Inc.™ for six different gestures (classes) from seven subjects, as well as its processing, feature extraction, training the classifier and further real-time validation. The results show that system provides acceptable classification rates.","authors":["Konstantin Akhmadeev","Elena Rampone","Tianyi Yu","Yannick Aoustin"],"meta":["July 2017IFAC-PapersOnLine 50(1):11498-11503","DOI:10.1016/j.ifacol.2017.08.1602"],"references":["305525348_Evaluating_Sign_Language_Recognition_Using_the_Myo_Armband","304298597_Hand_posture_and_gesture_recognition_using_MYO_armband_and_spectral_collaborative_representation_based_classification","301529601_Anthropomorphic_Underactuated_Hand_with_15_Joints","283326092_A_Versatile_Embedded_Platform_for_EMG_Acquisition_and_Gesture_Recognition","273401089_Current_state_of_digital_signal_processing_in_myoelectric_interfaces_and_related_applications","314273682_Single_Channel_Surface_EMG_Control_of_Advanced_Prosthetic_Hands_A_Simple_Low_Cost_and_Efficient_Approach","309348640_24_DOF_EMG_controlled_hybrid_actuated_prosthetic_hand","307881957_LIBSVM_A_library_for_support_vector_machines","261440387_A_real-time_EMG_pattern_recognition_method_for_virtual_myoelectric_hand_control","260800723_A_Hand_Gesture_Recognition_Framework_and_Wearable_Gesture-Based_Interaction_Prototype_for_Mobile_Devices"]}
