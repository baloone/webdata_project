{"id":"327211329_A_Parametric_Framework_for_Reversible_Pi-Calculi","abstract":"This paper presents a study of causality in a reversible, concurrent setting. There exist various notions of causality in pi-calculus, which differ in the treatment of parallel extrusions of the same name. In this paper we present a uniform framework for reversible pi-calculi that is parametric with respect to a data structure that stores information about an extrusion of a name. Different data structures yield different approaches to the parallel extrusion problem. We map three well-known causal semantics into our framework. We show that the (parametric) reversibility induced by our framework is causally-consistent and prove a causal correspondence between an appropriate instance of the framework and Boreale and Sangiorgi's causal semantics.","authors":["Doriana Medic","Claudio Antares Mezzina","Iain Phillips","Nobuko Yoshida"],"meta":["August 2018","DOI:10.4204/EPTCS.276.8"],"references":["316723240_Proof-relevant_p-calculus_a_constructive_account_of_concurrency_and_causality","281470326_Rigid_Families_for_CCS_and_the_p-calculus","280752222_Causal-Consistent_Reversible_Debugging","262279575_Concurrent_Flexible_Reversibility","313783846_A_Stable_Non-interleaving_Early_Operational_Semantics_for_the_Pi-Calculus","312628416_Logical_reversibility_of_computation","304621295_Static_VS_Dynamic_Reversibility_in_CCS","278828881_Reversibility_in_the_higher-order_p-calculus","277283826_A_functional_quantum_programming_language","262237415_Modelling_of_Bonding_with_Processes_and_Events"]}
