{"id":"325799313_Evolutionary_Approach_to_Deep_Learning","abstract":"This chapter describes an evolutionary approach to deep learning networks. We first explain neuroevolution approach, which can adaptively learn a network structure and size appropriate to the task. A typical example of neuroevolution is NEAT. NEAT has demonstrated performance superior to that of conventional methods in a large number of problems. Then, several studies on deep neural networks with evolutionary optimization are explained, such as Genetic CNNs, hierarchical feature construction using GP, and Differentiable pattern-producing network (DPPSN).","authors":["Hitoshi Iba"],"meta":["June 2018","DOI:10.1007/978-981-13-0200-8_3","In book: Evolutionary Approach to Machine Learning and Deep Neural Networks (pp.77-104)"],"references":["319770123_Densely_Connected_Convolutional_Networks","306885833_Densely_Connected_Convolutional_Networks","305196650_Going_deeper_with_convolutions","266656286_Evolving_multimodal_behavior_with_modular_neural_networks_in_Ms_Pac-Man","251432717_A_Hypercube-Based_Indirect_Encoding_for_Evolving_Large-Scale_Neural_Networks","23986881_A_Hypercube-Based_Encoding_for_Evolving_Large-Scale_Neural_Networks","3837524_SBART_24_Breeding_2D_CG_images_and_movies_and_creating_a_type_of_collage","328829520_Agent-Based_Modeling_and_Simulation_with_Swarm","322060630_Genetic_CNN","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","318071861_A_genetic_programming_approach_to_designing_convolutional_neural_network_architectures","311609041_Deep_Residual_Learning_for_Image_Recognition","306218037_Learning_multiple_layers_of_features_from_tiny_images","301227546_Convolution_by_Evolution_Differentiable_Pattern_Producing_Networks","286512696_Deep_Residual_Learning_for_Image_Recognition","272194743_Batch_Normalization_Accelerating_Deep_Network_Training_by_Reducing_Internal_Covariate_Shift","269935079_Adam_A_Method_for_Stochastic_Optimization","266031774_Reading_Digits_in_Natural_Images_with_Unsupervised_Feature_Learning","265385906_Very_Deep_Convolutional_Networks_for_Large-Scale_Image_Recognition","261159597_Agent-based_Modeling_and_Simulation_in_construction","241770394_HyperNEAT-GGP_a_hyperNEAT-based_atari_general_game_player","220691478_The_book_of_L","220286080_Compositional_pattern_producing_networks_A_novel_abstraction_of_development","11207536_Evolving_Neural_Networks_through_Augmenting_Topologies","2825727_A_Review_of_Evolutionary_Neural_Networks"]}
