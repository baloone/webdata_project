{"id":"297765000_Discrete_generalized_rayleigh_distribution","abstract":"In this paper, a new two-parameter discrete distribution is introduced which is in fact an analogue of the continuous generalized Rayleigh distribution, called discrete generalized Rayleigh distribution. The one parameter discrete Rayleigh distribution is obtained as a particular case. Several important distributional and reliability properties such as survival and hazard rate functions, moments, order statistics, unimodality and infinite divisibility of the proposed distribution are examined. A related characterization of the distribution is also provided. Parameter estimation, using different methods, namely methods of moments, maximum likelihood and proportion, is discussed. Performance of the different estimation methods are compared by means of a Monte Carlo simulation. Finally, two real data sets are analyzed to investigate the suitability of the proposed distribution in modeling count data.","authors":["M.H. Alamatsaz","Sanku Dey","Tanujit Dey","S.
