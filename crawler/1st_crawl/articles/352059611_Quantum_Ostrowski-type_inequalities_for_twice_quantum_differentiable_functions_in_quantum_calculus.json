{"id":"352059611_Quantum_Ostrowski-type_inequalities_for_twice_quantum_differentiable_functions_in_quantum_calculus","abstract":"In this paper, we first prove an identity for twice quantum differentiable functions. Then, by utilizing the convexity of ∣ D q 2 b f ∣ | {}^{b}D_{q}^{2}\\hspace{0.08em}f| and ∣ D q 2 a f ∣ | {}_{a}D_{q}^{2}\\hspace{0.08em}f| , we establish some quantum Ostrowski inequalities for twice quantum differentiable mappings involving q a {q}_{a} and q b {q}^{b} -quantum integrals. The results presented here are the generalization of already published ones.","authors":["Muhammad Aamir Ali","Hüseyin Budak","Abdullah Akkurt","Yuming Chu"],"meta":["June 2021Open Mathematics 19(1):440-449","DOI:10.1515/math-2021-0020"],"references":["348660303_New_quantum_boundaries_for_quantum_Simpson's_and_quantum_Newton's_type_inequalities_for_preinvex_functions","348323500_Quantum_variant_of_Montgomery_identity_and_Ostrowski-type_inequalities_for_the_mappings_of_two_variables","347303596_Some_new_Simpson's_type_inequalities_for_coordinated_convex_functions_in_quantum_calculus","345730230_Some_Quantum_Estimates_of_Hermite-Hadamard_Inequalities_for_Convex_Functions","345139771_New_post_quantum_analogues_of_Ostrowski_type_inequalities_using_new_definitions_of_left-right_pq-derivatives_and_definite_integrals","344166446_Some_New_Newton's_Type_Integral_Inequalities_for_Co-Ordinated_Convex_Functions_in_Quantum_Calculus","343071701_Simpson_and_Newton_type_inequalities_for_convex_functions_via_newly_defined_quantum_integrals","343049408_Some_New_Quantum_Hermite-Hadamard_Like_Inequalities_for_Co-Ordinated_Convex_Functions","342643486_Some_New_Simpson's_type_inequalities_for_co-ordinated_convex_functions_in_quantum_calculus","342411056_QUANTUM_HERMITE-HADAMARD_TYPE_INEQUALITIES_FOR_FUNCTIONS_WHOSE_SECOND_q_b_-DERIVATIVES_ABSOLUTE_VALUE_ARE_CONVEX"]}
