{"id":"314969508_Overreaction_to_extreme_market_events_and_investor_sentiment","abstract":"This article investigates the role of investor psychology, captured here by investor sentiment index, in driving individual stock price reactions to extreme movements in the broader market. In addition to confirming prior evidence of overreaction, we find much stronger overreaction when investor sentiment is low rather than high. This is consistent with the role of the contrast dimension of an uncommon event, suggested in the psychology literature, over and above the emotion of surprise it brings about. In a low sentiment environment, the contrast is sharper and hence leads to stronger overreaction.","authors":["Pedro Guilherme Ribeiro Piccoli","Mo Chaudhury"],"meta":["March 2017Applied Economics Letters 25(2):1-4","DOI:10.1080/13504851.2017.1302052"],"references":["263333022_The_share_is_down_8_after_the_profit_warning_is_it_time_to_buy","257474675_A_review_of_the_international_literature_on_the_short_term_predictability_of_stock_prices_conditional_on_large_prior_price_changes_Microstructure_behavioral_and_risk_related_explanations","293640291_Public_reaction_to_stock_market_volatility_evidence_from_the_ATUS","279899336_Liquidity_Risk_and_Expected_Stock_Returns","274843257_Stock_Returns_after_Major_Price_Shocks_The_Impact_of_Information","273312566_The_effect_of_reducing_quantitative_easing_on_emerging_markets","228679097_Is_Momentum_Really_Momentum","228258538_Stock_Returns_After_Major_Price_Shocks_The_Impact_of_Information","228172133_The_Short_of_It_Investor_Sentiment_and_Anomalies","228171889_Liquidity_Risk_and_Expect_Stock_Returns"]}
