{"id":"251496891_Delphi_A_brief_look_backward_and_forward","abstract":"In response to a request by the guest editors, we have set down our thoughts regarding the evolution of Delphi, beginning with our immersion in the subject in the late 1960s and concluding with some rumination about its future. Our focus is on the changing roles of Delphi. Most importantly, with the profound impact of the internet on organizational and community planning systems, it will foster a new age of participation through communication, coordination, and collaboration.","authors":["Harold Linstone","Murray Turoff"],"meta":["November 2011Technological Forecasting and Social Change 78(9):1712-1719","DOI:10.1016/j.techfore.2010.09.011"],"references":["292278341_The_past_present_and_future_of_Delphi","267762940_Clustering_Scenarios_using_Cross-Impact_Analysis","256353116_The_Use_of_Structural_Modeling_for_Technology_Assessment","248496667_The_Design_of_a_Policy_Delphi","324424802_Multiple_Perspectives_for_Decision-Making","251497801_Strategic_Foresight_Issue_Introduction","248496860_In_defense_of_Delphi","242634350_The_network_nation_human_communication_via_computing","240427371_RT_Delphi_An_efficient_round-less_almost_real_time_Delphi_method","239060364_Decision-making_for_Technology_Executives_Using_Multiple_Perspectives_to_Improve_Performance","234826853_Delphi_and_its_potential_impact_on_information_systems","238750454_The_Design_of_Inquiring_System","235737535_Still_Muddling_Not_Yet_Through","233870154_Essence_of_Decision_Explaining_The_Cuban_Missile_Crisis","232581256_Managing_the_unexpected_Assuring_high_performance_in_an_age_of_complexity_University_of_Michigan_business_school_management_series"]}
