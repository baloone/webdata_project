{"id":"336969599_Introduction_to_Wearable_Enhanced_Learning_WELL_Trends_Opportunities_and_Challenges","abstract":"Wearable enhanced learning (WELL) is an emerging area of interest for researchers, practitioners in educational institutions, and companies. Also many grassroots movements are providing new sensors, devices, prototypical concepts, and learning solutions for WELL. Deeply rooted in the traditions of technology enhanced learning (TEL), such as self-regulated learning and mobile learning, WELL has been generating new challenges and opportunities in the field. Fragmentation, scalability, and data aggregation and resulting pedagogical approaches are among the key challenges and opportunities. The authors of this chapter explore drivers and affordances of wearable enhanced learning, outline the development of WELL as part of the evolution of technology enhanced learning, describe the key stakeholders in WELL (business, vocational training, higher education, and maker communities), and inspect some of the key domains in WELL, such as gaming and entertainment, health and sports, business and industries, and some technology trends, such as e-textiles, smart accessories, and head-mounted displays. This chapter broadens current perspectives on learning with wearables and learning about wearables and integrates insights from related fields including philosophy of technology, sociology, and design.","authors":["Ilona Buchem","Ralf Klamma","Fridolin Wild"],"meta":["November 2019","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-64301-4_1","In book: Perspectives on Wearable Enhanced Learning (WELL) (pp.3-32)","Projects: Wearable Experience for Knowledge Intensive Training (WEKIT) - oldWearable Experience for Knowledge Intensive Training (WEKIT)"],"references":["328686868_Put_your_glasses_on_Conceptualizing_affordances_of_mixed_and_virtual_reality_for_enterprise_architecture_management","322375325_A_wearable-enhanced_fitness_program_for_older_adults_combining_fitness_trackers_and_gamification_elements_the_pilot_study_fMOOCHome","319959446_Internet_of_Things_in_Higher_Education_A_Study_on_Future_Learning","318876157_ImAxes_Immersive_Axes_as_Embodied_Affordances_for_Interactive_Multivariate_Data_Visualisation","317868504_Bridging_the_Skills_Gap_of_Workers_in_Industry_40_by_Human_Performance_Augmentation_Tools_Challenges_and_Roadmap","317416308_Privacy_of_the_Internet_of_Things_A_Systematic_Literature_Review","309462551_Perceived_Utility_and_Feasibility_of_Wearable_Technologies_in_Higher_Education","305861000_Wearable_Technology_Opportunities_and_Challenges_for_Teaching_And_Learning_In_Higher_Education_in_Developing_Countries","304157732_Learning_Analytics_Methods_Benefits_and_Challenges_in_Higher_Education_A_Systematic_Literature_Review","303066373_Exploring_Mobile_Affordances_in_the_Digital_Classroom","285484026_Usability_Assessment_of_Drone_Technology_as_Safety_Inspection_Tools","282638814_What_are_the_educational_affordances_of_wearable_technologies","281276460_IoT-Academia_Architecture_A_profound_approach","279177017_Internet_of_Things_A_Survey_on_Enabling_Technologies_Protocols_and_Applications","276273581_IMS-Based_Mobile_Learning_System","263741051_Wearable_Electronics_and_Smart_Textiles_A_Critical_Review","262545606_Serious_Games_A_New_Paradigm_for_Education","260722634_From_Smart_Objects_to_Social_Objects_The_Next_Evolutionary_Step_of_the_Internet_of_Things","327529676_The_potential_influence_of_privacy_risk_on_activity_tracker_usage_a_study","326360528_An_Augmented_Reality_Framework_for_Gamified_Learning_17th_International_Conference_Chiang_Mai_Thailand_August_22-24_2018_Proceedings","325711310_From_AR_to_Expertise_A_User_Study_of_an_Augmented_Reality_Training_to_Support_Expertise_Development","324352933_The_Ecological_Approach_to_Visual_Perception","322506617_Recent_advances_in_neural_dust_towards_a_neural_interface_platform","322191668_Wearable_Technology_Facilitating_or_Complexing_Education","321654118_Quantified_Baby_Parenting_and_the_Use_of_a_Baby_Wearable_in_the_Wild","321542696_The_Drivers_of_Wearable_Device_Usage_Practice_and_Perspectives","320536242_Wearable_technology_for_personalized_construction_safety_monitoring_and_trending_Review_of_applicable_devices","319948342_Empathy_and_embodied_experience_in_virtual_environment_To_what_extent_can_virtual_reality_stimulate_empathy_and_embodied_experience","317427748_Community_Learning_Analytics_with_Industry_40_and_Wearable_Sensor_Data","316499090_Smartwatches_Digital_Handcuffs_or_Magic_Bracelets","314634607_The_Potential_Influence_of_Privacy_Risk_on_Activity_Tracker_Usage_A_Study","313730983_The_computer_for_the_21st_century","304413228_An_innovative_augmented_reality_educational_framework_with_gamification_to_assist_the_learning_process_of_children_with_intellectual_disabilities","303760488_Dynamic_capabilities_and_strategic_management","297719522_From_data_fetishism_to_quantifying_selves_Self-tracking_practices_and_the_other_values_of_data","293808604_The_chips_are_down_for_Moore's_law","290541633_The_body_hacktivism_movement_A_talk_about_the_body","281276293_IoT-academia_architecture_A_profound_approach","280388263_A_Wireless_Fully-Passive_Neural_Recording_Device_for_Unobtrusive_Neuropotential_Monitoring","270787582_Serious_Games","269495896_The_Psychology_of_Everyday_Things","267921989_The_Duality_of_Technology_Rethinking_the_Concept_of_Technology_in_Organizations","267645015_Towards_Wearable_Augmented_Reality_in_Automotive_Assembly_Training","263720217_Wearable_Electrochemical_Sensors_and_Biosensors_A_Review","263464382_Communities_of_Practice_Learning_Meaning_and_Identity_CUP_Cambridge","261526097_Veilance_and_reciprocal_transparency_Surveillance_versus_sousveillance_AR_glass_lifeglogging_and_wearable_computing","259258838_Smart_Mobs","259253284_The_ecological_approach_to_visual_perception","257918991_The_Computer_for_the_21st_Century","256752678_Enclothed_cognition","248956659_Don't_Forget_About_the_Correspondence_Theory_of_Truth","247870804_The_Evolution_of_Deficit_Thinking_Educational_Thought_and_Practice","243776667_Die_Gesellschaft_Der_Gesellschaft","243772552_Dynamic_Capabilities_and_Strategic_Management","238172633_Actor_Network_Theory_and_After"]}
