{"id":"278697954_Design_and_Research_of_Urban_Intelligent_Transportation_System_Based_on_the_Internet_of_Things","abstract":"The concept of intelligent transportation has been accepted by society and has been applied widely. At the same time, the problems of the intelligent transportation are emerging and the Internet of Things (IOT) provides a new direction for its development. The paper first analyzed the concept of IOT, key technologies and system architecture, and then researched the demands of intelligent transportation’s function to put forward the structure of overall function of the urban intelligent transportation management based on IOT. Besides, the paper also discussed the key technologies involved in the urban intelligent transportation management and designed a detailed structural model of the intelligent transportation system based on IOT. Finally, the paper forecasted the potentials of China’s intelligent transportation system based on IOT.","authors":["Hong Zhou","Bingwu Liu","Donghan Wang"],"meta":["January 2012","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-32427-7_82","In book: Internet of Things (pp.572-580)"],"references":["322478730_Research_on_Addressing_Technology_of_Internet_of_Things","288442920_Research_on_key_technology_of_name_service_for_the_internet_of_things"]}
