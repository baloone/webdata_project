{"id":"353316021_Dual_adversarial_convolutional_networks_with_multi-level_cues_for_pancreatic_segmentation","abstract":"Accurate organ segmentation in medical imaging is a relatively challenging subject, especially for pancreas whose morphological characteristics are subtle but variable. In this paper, a novel dual adversarial convolutional network with multi-level cues (DACN-MC) is proposed for segmenting pancreas from computerized tomography (CT). DACN-MC first involves a duplex adversarial network to a conventional model for biomedical image segmentation, which ensures the facticity of the predicted probability volumes and ulteriorly enhances the quality of the obtained maps. Specifically, one of the adversarial networks urges the predicted maps to resemble the ground truths through importing an extra guidance into the original loss functions. The other adversarial network further judges whether the obtained maps are well-segmented and improves the images quality once again. Then, multi-level cues collection module (MCCM) is introduced to gather much useful details for pancreas segmentation. That is, we collect several sets of material formed by features from different layers and pick out a group with optimal performance into the ultimate algorithm. Experimental results show that the dual adversarial convolutional networks together with multi-level cues collection allow our proposed algorithm achieves competitive segmentation performance via several evaluation indexes.","authors":["Meiyu Li","Fenghui Lian","Chunyu Wang","Shuxu Guo"],"meta":["July 2021Physics in Medicine and Biology 66(17)","DOI:10.1088/1361-6560/ac155f"],"references":["334498257_Liver_Semantic_Segmentation_Algorithm_Based_on_Improved_Deep_Adversarial_Networks_in_Combination_of_Weighted_Loss_Function_on_Abdominal_CT_Images","331381617_Automatic_Multi-Organ_Segmentation_in_Thorax_CT_Images_Using_U-Net-GAN","324151028_Pancreas_Segmentation_in_CT_and_MRI_Images_via_Domain_Specific_Network_Designing_and_Recurrent_Neural_Contextual_Learning","323796282_An_application_of_cascaded_3D_fully_convolutional_networks_for_medical_image_segmentation","319631503_Improving_Deep_Pancreas_Segmentation_in_CT_and_MRI_Images_via_Recurrent_Neural_Contextual_Learning_and_Direct_Loss_Function","319461404_A_Fixed-Point_Model_for_Pancreas_Segmentation_in_Abdominal_CT_Scans","313212493_Spatial_Aggregation_of_Holistically-Nested_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_Automated_Pancreas_Localization_and_Segmentation","301847949_Sub-cortical_brain_structure_segmentation_using_F-CNN's","251878461_The_Cancer_Imaging_Archive_TCIA_Maintaining_and_Operating_a_Public_Information_Repository","351638954_A_Two-Phase_Approach_using_Mask_R-CNN_and_3D_U-Net_for_High-Accuracy_Automatic_Segmentation_of_Pancreas_in_CT_Imaging","344211848_Pancreas_segmentation_based_on_an_adversarial_model_under_two-tier_constraints","333957238_Fully_Automatic_Liver_Attenuation_Estimation_combing_CNN_Segmentation_and_Morphological_Operations","329747450_Recurrent_Saliency_Transformation_Network_Incorporating_Multi-stage_Visual_Cues_for_Small_Organ_Segmentation","323373643_cC-GAN_A_Robust_Transfer-learning_Framework_for_HEp-2_Specimen_Image_Segmentation","319770355_Generative_Adversarial_Nets","305193694_U-Net_Convolutional_Networks_for_Biomedical_Image_Segmentation","296476972_Lung_Pattern_Classification_for_Interstitial_Lung_Diseases_Using_a_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Network"]}
