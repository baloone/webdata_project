Problem-based learning (PBL) may help preservice teachers prepare for these situations through self-directed knowledge acquisition or direct instruction. In a first study, we applied a two-group design where students acquired knowledge through either self-directed learning (CG) or direct instruction (EG). Depending on the treatment, we examined differences in knowledge about classroom disruptions and in professional vision (noticing and knowledge-based reasoning). Knowledge was assessed with a multiple-choice test, and professional vision through video case analysis. EG showed higher scores in knowledge than CG and mentioned more knowledge-based reasons. In a second study, pre-post comparison showed increased knowledge and reasoning over time. Noticing did not differ between groups in Study 1 and remained stable in Study 2.","authors":["Victoria Luise Barth","Valentina Piwowar","Irina R.
