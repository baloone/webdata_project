{"id":"332311447_More_than_access_MOOCs_and_changes_in_Chinese_higher_education","abstract":"This paper presents an analysis of the conceptualization of massive open online courses (MOOCs) by major influencers in Chinese higher education. Using critical discourse analysis, predominantly from university resources, a map of the discursive construction of MOOCs is presented and interpreted. The centralized orientation of decision making in Chinese higher education is reflected in how MOOCs have been introduced, envisioned, and utilized in China. With the increase of Chinese MOOCs, elite universities are able to capitalize on their comparative advantages, which may be counter to the true intent of MOOCs, which is to raise teaching standards across sectors. This paper serves to illuminate how MOOCs may reinforce the status of elite universities, thereby having the opposite effect to their real intention of democratizing higher education for the masses. The strategy of using MOOCs to improve teaching quality and augment the worldwide reputation of Chinese institutions is central to Chinaâ€™s reinvigorated focus on higher education, which counters the widely held perception, and intention, that MOOCs are vehicles for widening access.","authors":["Jingjing Zhang","Hongmei Sziegat","Kirk Perris","Chenchen Zhou"],"meta":["April 2019Learning Media and Technology 44(1):1-16","DOI:10.1080/17439884.2019.1602541"],"references":["324324445_Critical_Discourse_Analysis_The_Critical_Analysis_of_Language","316605443_The_Chinese_National_Top_Level_Courses_Project_Using_Open_Educational_Resources_to_Promote_Quality_in_Undergraduate_Education","312959906_Fixing_higher_education_through_technology_Canadian_media_coverage_of_massive_open_online_courses","282610361_Public_Response_to_the_MOOC_Movement_in_China_Examining_the_Time_Series_of_Microblogging","279039201_Making_'MOOCs'_The_Construction_of_a_New_Digital_Higher_Education_within_News_Media_Discourse","272128169_The_dark_side_of_the_MOOC_-_A_critical_inquiry_on_their_claims_and_realities","264865136_The_sociology_of_education_and_digital_technology_Past_present_and_future","249712799_Linguistic_and_Intertextual_Analysis_Within_Discourse_Analysis","248925369_Intertextuality_Interpretive_practice_and_textual_strategy","324734661_Comparing_the_Open_University_Systems_of_China_and_India_Origins_Developments_and_Prospects","287835712_Critical_Discourse_Analysis_and_Rhetoric_and_Composition","287365829_Distrusting_educational_technology_Critical_questions_for_changing_times","276128022_Chinese_university_governance_Tensions_and_reforms","276122861_Minding_our_language_why_education_and_technology_is_full_of_bullshit_and_what_might_be_done_about_it","271226402_Massive_Open_Online_Change_Exploring_the_Discursive_Construction_of_the_'MOOC'_in_Newspapers","259976355_Critical_Discourse_Analysis_The_Critical_Study_of_Language","255567331_A_Paradigm_Shift_Technology_Integration_for_Higher_Education_in_the_New_Millennium","253977159_Language_and_the_design_of_texts"]}
