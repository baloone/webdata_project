{"id":"232652294_Towards_Faster_String_Matching_for_Intrusion_Detection_or_Exceeding_the_Speed_of_Snort","abstract":"Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) often rely on exact string matching techniques. Depending on the choice of algorithm, implementation, and the frequency with which it is applied, this pattern matching may become a performance bottleneck. To keep up with increasing network speeds and traffic, NIDS can take advantage of advanced string matching algorithms. In this paper we describe the effectiveness of a significantly faster approach to pattern matching in the open source NIDS Snort.","authors":["C.
