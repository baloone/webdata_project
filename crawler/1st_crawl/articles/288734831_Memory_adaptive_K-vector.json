{"id":"288734831_Memory_adaptive_K-vector","abstract":"This paper present two new capabilities of the k-vector range searching technique. The first one is a new feature for database with invariant number of elements whose values are changing. For these database, as long as the elements variation do not generate values outside the database bounds, the k-vector is updated by a very fast and computationally simple procedure with no need to rebuild the entire k-vector. The second new capability is the ability to build the k-vector with any size of available memory, making the k-vector independent from the database size. This new feature is particularly suitable on onboard space implementation where the memory available is limited as well as on ground applications when dealing with strongly nonlinear database. The more memory is available to allocate k-vector elements the faster the range searching is. Performance analysis for these two new enhancements and examples are provided.","authors":["D.
