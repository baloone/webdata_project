{"id":"262193800_Coefficient_estimates_for_a_subclass_of_analytic_and_bi-univalent_functions","abstract":"In the present investigation, we consider a new subclass Σ(τ,γ,φ)Σ(τ,γ,φ) of the class ΣΣ consisting of analytic and bi-univalent functions in the open unit disk UU. For functions belonging to the class Σ(τ,γ,φ)Σ(τ,γ,φ) introduced here, we obtain estimates on the first two Taylor–Maclaurin coefficients |a2||a2| and |a3||a3|. Several related classes of analytic and bi-univalent functions in UU are also considered and connections to some of the earlier known results are pointed out.","authors":["Hari Mohan Srivastava","Deepak Bansal"],"meta":["May 2014Journal of the Egyptian Mathematical Society 23(2)","DOI:10.1016/j.joems.2014.04.002"],"references":["312268787_Coefficient_estimates_for_some_families_of_bi-Bazilevic_functions_of_the_Ma-Minda_type_involving_the_Hohlov_operator","284686139_Certain_subclasses_of_bi-univalent_functions_satisfying_subordinate_conditions","279900936_Coefficient_estimates_for_a_class_of_analytic_and_bi-univalent_functions","303339882_Early_coefficients_of_the_inverse_of_a_regular_convex_function","288010245_Univalent_functions_Grundlehren_der_Mathematischen_Wissenschaften","284680093_Coefficient_estimates_for_certain_subclasses_of_biunivalent_functions","267985300_Some_remarks_on_bi-univalent_functions","267476213_Coefficient_bounds_for_certain_subclasses_of_bi-univalent_functions","267433089_Some_Inequalities_and_Other_Results_Associated_with_Certain_Subclasses_of_Univalent_and_Bi-Univalent_Analytic_Functions","267183193_The_coefficient_estimates_for_bi-univalent_functions"]}
