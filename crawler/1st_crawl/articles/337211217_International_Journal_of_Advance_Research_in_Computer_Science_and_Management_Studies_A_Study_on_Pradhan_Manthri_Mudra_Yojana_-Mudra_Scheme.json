Of all these the main problem of Micro and small enterprises is availability of finance. A major part of these enterprises are unorganized and unregistered and do not maintain proper books of accounts nor have collateral security. So the commercial banks find it difficult to provide financial assistance to this sector. In order to provide financial assistance and support to the MSME sector Government of India has launched the MUDRA Scheme. The study aims to bring out the performance of Pradhan Manthri Mudra Yojana-MUDRA Scheme in the last four financial years.","authors":["Poornima Venkidapathy"],"meta":["November 2019International Journal of Advance Research in Computer Science and Management Volume 7(Issue 8):17-20","Project: National missions"],"references":[]}
