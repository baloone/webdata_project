{"id":"4013724_A_multi-stage_Levinson-Durbin_algorithm","abstract":"This paper proposes an adaptive multi-stage Levinson-Durbin algorithm, which is more numerically robust than the conventional Levinson-Durbin algorithm for input signals with high spectral dynamics such as speech or audio signals. At the same time, the proposed algorithm preserves the computational efficiency of the Levinson-Durbin algorithm. It can be therefore suitable to be used in practical linear prediction coding systems as a replacement of the Levinson-Durbin algorithm for better coding performance.","authors":["Rongshan Yu","Xiao Lin","C.C.
