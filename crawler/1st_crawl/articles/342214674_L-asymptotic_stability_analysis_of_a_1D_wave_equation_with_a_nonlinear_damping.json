{"id":"342214674_L-asymptotic_stability_analysis_of_a_1D_wave_equation_with_a_nonlinear_damping","abstract":"This paper is concerned with the asymptotic stability analysis of a one dimensional wave equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions subject to a nonlinear distributed damping within an Lp functional framework, p∈[2,∞]. Some well-posedness results are provided together with exponential decay to zero of trajectories, with an estimation of the decay rate. The well-posedness results are proved by considering an appropriate energy functional in the appropriate functional spaces and introduced by Haraux in [A. Haraux, Int. J. Math. Modelling Num. Opt., 2009]. The asymptotic behavior analysis is based on an attractivity result of a trajectory of an infinite-dimensional linear time-varying system with a special structure, which relies on the introduction of a suitable Lyapunov functional. Note that some of the results of this paper apply for a large class of nonmonotone dampings.","authors":["Yacine Chitour","Swann Marx","Christophe Prieur"],"meta":["November 2020Journal of Differential Equations 269(10):8107-8131","DOI:10.1016/j.jde.2020.06.007"],"references":["335424148_Stability_Analysis_of_Dissipative_Systems_Subject_to_Nonlinear_Damping_via_Lyapunov_Techniques","320385061_Cone-bounded_feedback_laws_for_m-dissipative_operators_on_Hilbert_spaces","318210194_Nonlinear_vibrations_and_the_wave_equation","308324712_Global_Stabilization_of_a_Korteweg--De_Vries_Equation_With_Saturating_Distributed_Control","265666210_A_Systematic_method_for_building_smooth_controls_for_smooth_data","255179912_Observation_and_Control_for_Operator_Semigroups","250968486_L_p_estimates_of_solutions_to_some_non-linear_wave_equations_in_one_space_dimension","246867803_Montone_Operators_in_Banach_Space_and_Nonlinear_Partial_Differential_Equations","228931615_Exponential_stability_for_the_wave_equation_with_weak_nonmonotone_damping","2717502_On_Finite_Gain_Stabilizability_of_Linear_Systems_Subject_to_Input_Saturation","2505580_A_Note_on_Stabilization_With_Saturating_Feedback","333231082_Decay_of_approximate_solutions_for_the_damped_semilinear_wave_equation_on_a_bounded_1d_domain","313504316_Stability_and_Boundary_Stabilization_of_1-D_Hyperbolic_Systems","291388721_Wave_Equation_With_Cone-Bounded_Control_Laws","278658838_On_Some_Recent_Advances_on_Stabilization_for_Hyperbolic_Equations","267144172_Partial_Differential_Equations_An_Introduction","264955351_Interpolation_Spaces_An_Introduction","248390625_Nonlinear_Semigroups","248390442_Function_Analysis_Sobolev_Spaces_and_Partial_Differential_Equations","246151940_Extending_a_theorem_of_Liapunov_to_Hilbert_spaces","243046468_Exponential_Decay_for_The_Semilinear_Wave_Equation_with_Locally_Distributed_Damping","242998495_Stabilisation_frontiere_indirecte_de_systemes_faiblement_couples","242655769_Extending_a_theorem_of_A_M_Liapunov_to_Hilbert_space","238851096_Strong_decay_for_wave_equations_with_nonlinear_nonmonotone_damping","232243088_Evolution_Semigroups_in_Dynamical_Systems_and_Differential_Equations","231923442_Weak_Asymptotic_Decay_via_a_'Relaxed_Invariance_Principle'_for_a_Wave_Equation_with_Nonlinear_Nonmonotone_Damping","225551742_Feedback_stabilization_of_a_linear_control_system_in_Hilbert_space_with_a_priori_bounded_control","222187051_Lp_Estimates_for_the_Wave_Equation","220258775_Indirect_boundary_stabilization_of_weakly_coupled_systems","44376113_Nonlinear_vibrations_and_the_wave_equation_A_Haraux","44376017_Semigroups_of_Linear_Operators_and_Applications_to_Partial_Differential_Equations","29672240_On_the_equations_of_evolution_in_a_Banach_space"]}
