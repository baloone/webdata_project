{"id":"227090938_Producing_high-dimensional_semantic_space_from_lexical_co-occurence","abstract":"A procedure that processes a corpus of text and produces numeric vectors containing information about its meanings for each\nword is presented. This procedure is applied to a large corpus of natural language text taken from Usenet, and the resulting\nvectors are examined to determine what information is contained within them. These vectors provide the coordinates in a high-dimensional\nspace in which word relationships can be analyzed. Analyses of both vector similarity and multidimensional scaling demonstrate\nthat there is significant semantic information carried in the vectors. A comparison of vector similarity with human reaction\ntimes in a single-word priming experiment is presented. These vectors provide the basis for a representational model of semantic\nmemory, hyperspace analogue to language (HAL).","authors":["Kevin Lund","Curt Burgess"],"meta":["June 1996Behavior Research Methods 28(2):203-208","DOI:10.3758/BF03204766"],"references":["265372476_Pathfinder_Associative_Networks_Studies_in_Knowledge_Organization","232593340_Semantic_priming_and_retrieval_from_lexical_memory_Roles_of_inhibitionless_spreading_activation_and_limited-capacity_attention","230875894_Multiple_Constraints_in_Syntactic_Ambiguity_Resolution_A_Connectionist_Account_of_Psycholinguistic_Data","304115919_CHAPTER_9_SUBSTITUTION_CONTEXT_AND_ASSOCIATION1","258349471_Semantic_facilitation_without_association_in_a_lexical_decision_task","232561679_Multidimensional_Scaling_Theory_and_Applications_in_the_Behavioral_Sciences","226684174_Lexical_co-occurrence_and_association_strength","223939081_Semantic_and_associative_priming_in_the_cerebral_hemispheres_Some_words_do_some_words_don't_sometimes_some_places","6004020_Multidimensional_Scaling_Tree-Fitting_and_Clustering","3511029_Dimensions_of_meaning","2822964_The_Role_of_Correlated_Properties_in_Accessing_Conceptual_Memory","2479180_Lexical_Acquisition_Exploiting_On-Line_Resources_to_Build_a_Lexicon_Uri_Zernik_editor"]}
