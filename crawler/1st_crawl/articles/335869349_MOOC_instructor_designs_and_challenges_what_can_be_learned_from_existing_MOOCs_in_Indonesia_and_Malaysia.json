{"id":"335869349_MOOC_instructor_designs_and_challenges_what_can_be_learned_from_existing_MOOCs_in_Indonesia_and_Malaysia","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to explore Indonesian and Malaysian instructorsâ€™ perceptions of massive open online course (MOOC) design and how they deal with the design challenges. Surveys, email interviews, and course reviews are the main data-collection methods employed in this sequential mixed methods study. Forty-six instructors participated in the survey, and nine of them voluntarily participated in an email interview. The findings revealed that half of the courses were delivered using a hybrid/blended type of MOOC. Personal motives, institutional encouragement, and altruism were among the main reasons for instructors to offer MOOCs. Preparation, attraction, participation, and assessment were the categories used to explain the design strategies used by these instructors in designing their courses. The survey also revealed that collaboration encouragement, participant engagement, video development, and time constraints were the primary design challenges that the instructors experienced during the design process. Furthermore, most instructors sought advice from other MOOC instructors, MOOC providers, their institutions, video tutorials, and open educational resources (OERs) to surmount their design challenges.","authors":["Annisa R Sari","Curt Bonk","Meina Zhu"],"meta":["September 2019Asia Pacific Education Review
