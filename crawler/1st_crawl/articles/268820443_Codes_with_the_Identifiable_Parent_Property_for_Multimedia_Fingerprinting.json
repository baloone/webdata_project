{"id":"268820443_Codes_with_the_Identifiable_Parent_Property_for_Multimedia_Fingerprinting","abstract":"Let ${\\cal C}$ be a $q$-ary code of length $n$ and size $M$, and ${\\cal C}(i)\n= \\{{\\bf c}(i) \\ | \\ {\\bf c}=({\\bf c}(1), {\\bf c}(2), \\ldots, {\\bf c}(n))^{T}\n\\in {\\cal C}\\}$ be the set of $i$th coordinates of ${\\cal C}$. The descendant\ncode of a sub-code ${\\cal C}^{'} \\subseteq {\\cal C}$ is defined to be ${\\cal\nC}^{'}(1) \\times {\\cal C}^{'}(2) \\times \\cdots \\times {\\cal C}^{'}(n)$. In this\npaper, we introduce a multimedia analogue of codes with the identifiable parent\nproperty (IPP), called multimedia IPP codes or $t$-MIPPC$(n, M, q)$, so that\ngiven the descendant code of any sub-code ${\\cal C}^{'}$ of a multimedia\n$t$-IPP code ${\\cal C}$, one can always identify, as IPP codes do in the\ngeneric digital scenario, at least one codeword in ${\\cal C}^{'}$. We first\nderive a general upper bound on the size $M$ of a multimedia $t$-IPP code, and\nthen investigate multimedia $3$-IPP codes in more detail. We characterize a\nmultimedia $3$-IPP code of length $2$ in terms of a bipartite graph and a\ngeneralized packing, respectively. By means of these combinatorial\ncharacterizations, we further derive a tight upper bound on the size of a\nmultimedia $3$-IPP code of length $2$, and construct several infinite families\nof (asymptotically) optimal multimedia $3$-IPP codes of length $2$.","authors":["Minquan Cheng","Hung-Lin Fu","Jing Jiang","Yuan-Hsun Lo"],"meta":["April 2017Designs Codes and Cryptography 83(1)","DOI:10.1007/s10623-016-0203-x","SourcearXiv"],"references":["329786646_Generalized_quadrangles","268494079_Combinatorial_schemes_for_protecting_digital_content","267272310_New_Bounds_on_Separable_Codes_for_Multimedia_Fingerprinting","265817805_Integers_polynomials_and_rings_A_course_in_algebra","258239683_The_theory_of_error-correcting_codes_Parts_I_II","252797205_A_result_on_2k-cycle-free_bipartite_graphs","248598028_Graphs_without_cycles_of_even_length","248141876_Tracing_traitors_Advances_in_Cryptology-CRYPTO''94","247597462_Span-Symmetric_Generalized_Quadrangles","244428188_Generalized_quadrangles_as_group_coset_geometries"]}
