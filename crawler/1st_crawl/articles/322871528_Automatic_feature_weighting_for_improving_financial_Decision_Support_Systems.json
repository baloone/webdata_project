{"id":"322871528_Automatic_feature_weighting_for_improving_financial_Decision_Support_Systems","abstract":"We propose a novel methodology for improving financial Decision Support Systems (DSS) through automatic feature weighting. Using this methodology, we show that automatic feature weighting leads to a significant improvement in the performance of decision-making algorithms over financial data, which are the key of financial DSS. The statistical analysis carried out shows that metaheuristic algorithms are good for automatic feature weighting, and that Differential Evolution (DE) offers a good trade-off between decision-making performance and computational cost. We believe these results contribute to the development of novel financial DSS.","authors":["Yosimar Oswaldo Serrano-Silva","Yenny Villuendas-Rey","Cornelio Yáñez-Márquez"],"meta":["March 2018Decision Support Systems 107","DOI:10.1016/j.dss.2018.01.005"],"references":["276130126_A_novel_bat_algorithm_with_habitat_selection_and_Doppler_Effect_in_echoes_for_optimization","259572158_Machine_Assisted_Authentication_of_Paper_Currency_an_Experiment_on_Indian_Banknotes","243768726_Advances_in_Instance-Based_Learning_Algorithms","234786663_Fast_Training_of_Support_Vector_Machines_Using_Sequential_Minimal_Optimization","227242104_Differential_Evolution_-_A_Simple_and_Efficient_Heuristic_for_Global_Optimization_over_Continuous_Spaces","225215404_Beyond_Accuracy_F-Score_and_ROC_A_Family_of_Discriminant_Measures_for_Performance_Evaluation","220217590_An_experimental_comparison_of_classification_algorithms_for_imbalanced_credit_scoring_data_sets","317346245_The_Naive_Associative_Classifier_NAC_A_novel_simple_transparent_and_accurate_classification_model_evaluated_on_financial_data","311450485_Fast_effective_rule_induction","304629653_Credit_risk_evaluation_based_on_social_media","292209142_A_Novel_Corporate_Credit_Rating_System_Based_on_Student's-t_Hidden_Markov_Models","285332682_Advanced_Evolutionary_Algorithms","282627523_Diversity_techniques_improve_the_performance_of_the_best_imbalance_learning_ensembles","272825856_KEEL_Data-Mining_Software_Tool_Data_Set_Repository_Integration_of_Algorithms_and_Experimental_Analysis_Framework","270455330_Using_customer_lifetime_value_and_neural_networks_to_improve_the_prediction_of_bank_deposit_subscription_in_telemarketing_campaigns","267082388_Understanding_Risk_The_Theory_and_Practice_of_Financial_Risk_Management","262346379_Performance_of_corporate_bankruptcy_prediction_models_on_imbalanced_dataset_The_effect_of_sampling_methods","260805594_A_Data-Driven_Approach_to_Predict_the_Success_of_Bank_Telemarketing","259090148_On_the_importance_of_the_validation_technique_for_classification_with_imbalanced_datasets_Addressing_covariate_shift_when_data_is_skewed","257404394_Personal_bankruptcy_prediction_by_mining_credit_card_data","238355667_The_Use_of_Ranks_to_Avoid_the_Assumption_of_Normality_Implicit_in_the_Analysis_of_Variance","229091480_Learning_Representations_by_Back_Propagating_Errors","228385423_Rethinking_Marketing","227414939_Optimization_models_for_targeted_offers_in_direct_marketing_Exact_and_heuristic_algorithms","226952445_Genetic_Algorithms","216300794_A_Simple_Sequentially_Rejective_Multiple_Test_Procedure","215483218_A_novel_bankruptcy_prediction_model_based_on_an_adaptive_fuzzy_k-nearest_neighbor_method","38368280_A_Comparison_of_Alternative_Tests_of_Significance_for_the_Problem_of_m_Rankings"]}
