{"id":"341082057_A_new_color_image_encryption_scheme_based_on_2DNLCML_system_and_genetic_operations","abstract":"Based on the spatiotemporal chaos of the two Dimensional Nonlinear Coupled Map Lattices (2DNLCML) and genetic operations, a new optical color image encryption scheme is proposed. Because of the spatial nonlinear coupling which replaces traditional adjacent coupling, the 2DNLCML system contains good features such as ergodic pseudo-random sequence, less periodic windows in bifurcations and larger range of parameters in chaotic dynamics, which is more suitable for image encryption. The scheme also performs genetic operations including mutation and crossover for binary coding, thus reducing the computational complexity. Simulations have been carried out and the results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has properties of large key space, high sensitivity to key, strong resisting attack. So, it is more secure and effective algorithm for encryption of digital images.","authors":["Ying-Qian Zhang","Yi He","Pi Li","Xing-Yuan Wang"],"meta":["May 2020Optics and Lasers in Engineering
