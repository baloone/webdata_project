The methodology of forming design skills in the process of preparation for diploma design provides an integrative relationship between the theoretical component of training with industrial practice with the help of a diploma project, which involves functional tasks that a technician-mechanic should carry out in a professional activity.\nThe research substantiates the following methodological principles: the emphasis on the interrelation of the stages of diploma design and the study of professionally oriented disciplines for the formation of design skills engineering-mechanics; revealing of innovative directions of professional activity of technics-mechanics in modern conditions; identification of criteria for the development of design skills, based on new requirements and industry demands; the need for an individual approach to students; improvement of designing skills in the process of studying professionally oriented disciplines; taking into account the peculiarities of the practical training of future mechanics of the motor transport industry, based on the modern requirements of the motor transport industry. The main stages of the implementation of the methodology of forming the design skills in the process of preparation for graduation design and stages of its implementation, in particular analysis of residual knowledge on basic disciplines (mathematics, physics, computer science, drawing), studying of the discipline \"Introduction to a specialty\", practical work, examination of mental maps , completion of a course project, pre-diploma practice, defense of a diploma project, etc.","authors":["Yuriy Yakimets"],"meta":["February 2018ScienceRise Pedagogical Education","DOI:10.15587/2519-4984.2018.124424"],"references":[]}
