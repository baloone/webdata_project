{"id":"285449594_An_Osqrt_n_Space_Bound_for_Obstruction-Free_Leader_Election","abstract":"We present a deterministic obstruction-free implementation of leader election from \\(O(\\sqrt n)\\) atomic O(logn)-bit registers in the standard asynchronous shared memory system with n processes. We provide also a technique to transform any deterministic obstruction-free algorithm, in which any process can finish if it runs for b steps without interference, into a randomized wait-free algorithm for the oblivious adversary, in which the expected step complexity is polynomial in n and b. This transformation allows us to combine our obstruction-free algorithm with the leader election algorithm by Giakkoupis and Woelfel [21], to obtain a fast randomized leader election (and thus test-and-set) implementation from \\(O(\\sqrt n)\\)\nO(logn)-bit registers, that has expected step complexity O(log ∗ n) against the oblivious adversary.\nOur algorithm provides the first sub-linear space upper bound for obstruction-free leader election. A lower bound of Ω(logn) has been known since 1989 [29]. Our research is also motivated by the long-standing open problem whether there is an obstruction-free consensus algorithm which uses fewer than n registers.","authors":["George Giakkoupis","Maryam Helmi","Lisa Higham","Philipp Woelfel"],"meta":["October 2013","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-41527-2_4","Conference: International Symposium on Distributed Computing"],"references":["227322710_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","225752891_The_space_complexity_of_unbounded_timestamps","225711833_Randomized_Two-Process_Wait-Free_Test-and-Set","221344221_Atomic_Snapshots_of_Shared_Memory","221344186_Efficient_Asynchronous_Consensus_with_the_Weak_Adversary_Scheduler","221343398_Optimal-Time_Adaptive_Strong_Renaming_with_Applications_to_Counting_Extended_Abstract","221234193_Obstruction-Free_Algorithms_Can_Be_Practically_Wait-Free","221233958_The_Space_Complexity_of_Unbounded_Timestamps","221233823_Fast_Randomized_Test-and-Set_and_Renaming","221233796_Sub-logarithmic_Test-and-Set_against_a_Weak_Adversary","220431045_Impossibility_of_Distributed_Consensus_with_One_Faulty_Process","220430796_On_the_Space_Complexity_of_Randomized_Synchronization","220430613_Atomic_Snapshots_of_Shared_Memory","220266330_Impossibility_of_Distributed_Consensus_with_One_Faulty_Process","47842800_Randomized_Naming_Using_Wait-Free_Shared_Variables","2648040_Wait-Free_Synchronization","1955735_On_the_Importance_of_Having_an_Identity_or_is_Consensus_really_Universal_Extended_Abstract","312944514_Fast_Randomized_Test-and-Set_and_Renaming","312880972_Optimal-Time_Adaptive_Strong_Renaming_with_Applications_to_Counting","309456250_Wait-free_synchronization_ACM_Trans","266354976_Concentration","262365220_An_O1_RMRs_leader_election_algorithm","254463081_Faster_randomized_consensus_with_an_oblivious_adversary","247330191_Randomized_wait-free_test-and-set","233415819_On_the_Time_and_Space_Complexity_of_Randomized_Test-And-Set","227311943_Composite_registers","221498415_The_Complexity_of_Renaming","221344321_Lower_Bounds_for_Randomized_Consensus_under_a_Weak_Adversary","221343939_A_modular_approach_to_shared-memory_consensus_with_applications_to_the_probabilistic-write","221343715_Tight_Bounds_for_Shared_Memory_Symmetric_Mutual_Exclusion_Problems","221234107_Long-Lived_Fast_Waitfree_Renaming_with_Optimal_Name_Space_and_High_Throughput","221233686_Randomized_Consensus_in_Expected_On_2_Total_Work_Using_Single-Writer_Registers","220617588_Lower_Bounds_for_Randomized_Consensus_under_a_Weak_Adversary","220617578_Time_and_Space_Lower_Bounds_for_Nonblocking_Implementations","220432418_Tight_bounds_for_asynchronous_randomized_consensus","220431476_Time_lower_bounds_for_implementations_of_multi-writer_snapshots","220404795_Efficient_Synchronization_on_Multiprocessors_with_Shared_Memory","220268336_Tight_bounds_for_asynchronous_randomized_consensus","50893514_The_Space_Complexity_of_Long-Lived_and_One-Shot_Timestamp_Implementations"]}
