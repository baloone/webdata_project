{"id":"257388088_Consensus_of_Second-Order_Delayed_Multi-Agent_Systems_with_Leader-Following","abstract":"In this paper, a second-order consensus algorithm of multi-agent dynamical systems with leader-following is presented. With the hypothesis of a directed weighted connected graph composed of n agents together with a leader and the leader as a globally reachable node, the consensus algorithm with heterogeneous input delays is studied in the frequency domain. By applying Gershgorin disc theorem and curvature theory, decentralized consensus conditions for the multi-agent systems with asymmetric coupling weights are obtained. Finally, a simulation example is used to show the design of the parameters and the validity of the result.","authors":["Hong-Yong Yang","Xunlin Zhu","Si-Ying Zhang"],"meta":["March 2010European Journal of Control 16(2):188â€“199","DOI:10.3166/ejc.16.188-199"],"references":["224639278_Agreement_with_Non-Uniform_Information_Delays","224627875_Average_consensus_problems_in_networks_of_agents_with_delayed_communications","3032827_Stable_Flocking_of_Multiple_Inertial_Agents_on_Balanced_Graphs","3032094_Beard_RW_Consensus_seeking_in_multiagent_systems_under_dynamically_changing_interaction_topologies_IEEE_Trans_Autom_Control_505_655-661","243220698_Leader-following_consensus_problem_with_a_varying-velocity_leader_and_time-varying_delays","232324222_Clockwise_property_of_the_Nyquist_plot_with_implications_for_absolute_stability","228344906_State_Consensus_for_Multi-Agent_Systems_with_Switching_Topologies_and_Time-Varying_Delays","224627545_State_synchronization_in_local-interaction_networks_is_robust_with_respect_to_time_delays","224333136_Consensus_of_Multi-Agent_Systems_With_Diverse_Input_and_Communication_Delays","222651931_Robust_consensus_of_multi-agent_systems_with_diverse_input_delays_and_asymmetric_interconnection_perturbations","222548113_Leader-following_Coordination_of_Multi-agent_Systems_with_Coupling_Time_Delays","222426355_On_System_State_Equipartitioning_and_Semistability_in_Network_Dynamical_Systems_with_Arbitrary_Time-Delays","222126454_Distributed_discrete-time_coordinated_tracking_with_a_time-varying_reference_state_and_limited_communication","222120596_Multi-Vehicle_consensus_with_a_time-varying_reference_state","221933030_Murray_R_Consensus_Problems_in_Networks_of_Agents_With_Switching_Topology_and_Time-Delays_IEEE_Trans_Automat_Control_499_1520-1533","221933025_Consensus_and_Cooperation_in_Networked_Multi-Agent_Systems","30856814_Distributed_multi-vehicle_coordinated_control_via_local_information_exchange","8080281_On_partial_contraction_analysis_for_coupled_nonlinear_oscillators","4142935_Stability_of_continuous-time_distributed_consensus_algorithm","4006465_Coordination_of_groups_of_mobile_autonomous_agents_using_nearest_neighbor","3478030_Consensus_strategies_for_cooperative_control_of_vehicle_formations","3335132_Stability_analysis_and_design_of_the_second-order_congestion_control_for_networks_with_heterogeneous_delays","3207834_Information_consensus_in_multivehicle_cooperative_control_IEEE_Control_Systems_Magazine_272_71-82","3033162_On_Consensus_Algorithms_for_Double-Integrator_Dynamics","3032370_Flocking_for_Multi-Agent_Dynamic_Systems_Algorithms_and_Theory","3032048_Stability_of_multiagent_systems_with_time-dependent_communication_links","3031907_Information_Flow_and_Cooperative_Control_of_Vehicle_Formations","3031499_Coordination_of_Groups_of_Mobile_Autonomous_Agents_Using_Nearest_Neighbor_Rules","3028713_On_the_generalized_Nyquist_stability_criterion","2133530_Asynchronous_Consensus_in_Continuous-Time_Multi-Agent_Systems_With_Switching_Topology_and_Time-Varying_Delays"]}
