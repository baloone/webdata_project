{"id":"276851935_Robust_Facial_Expression_Classification_Using_Shape_and_Appearance_Features","abstract":"Facial expression recognition has many potential applications which has\nattracted the attention of researchers in the last decade. Feature extraction\nis one important step in expression analysis which contributes toward fast and\naccurate expression recognition. This paper represents an approach of combining\nthe shape and appearance features to form a hybrid feature vector. We have\nextracted Pyramid of Histogram of Gradients (PHOG) as shape descriptors and\nLocal Binary Patterns (LBP) as appearance features. The proposed framework\ninvolves a novel approach of extracting hybrid features from active facial\npatches. The active facial patches are located on the face regions which\nundergo a major change during different expressions. After detection of facial\nlandmarks, the active patches are localized and hybrid features are calculated\nfrom these patches. The use of small parts of face instead of the whole face\nfor extracting features reduces the computational cost and prevents the\nover-fitting of the features for classification. By using linear discriminant\nanalysis, the dimensionality of the feature is reduced which is further\nclassified by using the support vector machine (SVM). The experimental results\non two publicly available databases show promising accuracy in recognizing all\nexpression classes.","authors":["S L Happy","Aurobinda Routray"],"meta":["May 2015","DOI:10.1109/ICAPR.2015.7050661","SourcearXiv"],"references":["317083802_Eigenfaces_vs_Fisherfaces_Recognition_Using_Class_Specific_Linear_Projection","283477585_Automatic_Facial_Expression_Analysis_A_Survey","261525128_A_Real_Time_Facial_Expression_Classification_System_Using_Local_Binary_Patterns","261154749_Learning_Multiscale_Active_Facial_Patches_for_Expression_Analysis","232616387_Recognizing_Facial_Expression_Machine_Learning_and_Application_to_Spontaneous_Behavior","228849767_When_holistic_processing_is_not_enough_Local_features_save_the_day","312538118_Support-vector_networks","271513141_Support_Vector_Networks","263964385_Emotions_Revealed_Second_Edition_Recognizing_Faces_and_Feelings_to_Improve_Communication_and_Emotional_Life","262345601_Learning_active_facial_patches_for_expression_analysis","227031714_Facial_Expression_Recognition","226575631_Eigenfaces_vs_Fisherfaces_Recognition_Using_Class_Specific_Linear_Projection","226201524_Recognizing_Facial_Expressions_Automatically_from_Video","224165246_The_Extended_Cohn-Kanade_Dataset_CK_A_complete_dataset_for_action_unit_and_emotion-specified_expression","222573706_Automatic_Facial_Expression_Analysis_A_Survey"]}
