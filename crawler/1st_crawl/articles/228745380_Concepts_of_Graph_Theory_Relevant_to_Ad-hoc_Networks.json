{"id":"228745380_Concepts_of_Graph_Theory_Relevant_to_Ad-hoc_Networks","abstract":"The issues in Mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs) always bring the attention of research community. The fundamental issues of connectivity, scalability, routing and topol-ogy control in MANETS is worth to study. Graph theory plays an important role in the study of these fundamental issues. This paper highlights the concepts of graph theory that are employed to address these fundamental issues.","authors":["Rajan m a","M.
