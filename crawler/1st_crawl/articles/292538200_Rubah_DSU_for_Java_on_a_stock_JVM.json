{"id":"292538200_Rubah_DSU_for_Java_on_a_stock_JVM","abstract":"This paper presents Rubah, the first dynamic software updating system for Java that: is portable, implemented via libraries and bytecode rewriting on top of a standard JVM; is efficient, imposing essentially no overhead on normal, steady-state execution; is flexible, allowing nearly arbitrary changes to classes between updates; and is non-disruptive, employing either a novel eager algorithm that transforms the program state with multiple threads, or a novel lazy algorithm that transforms objects as they are demanded, postupdate. Requiring little programmer effort, Rubah has been used to dynamically update five long-running applications: the H2 database, the Voldemort key-value store, the Jake2 implementation of the Quake 2 shooter game, the CrossFTP server, and the JavaEmailServer.","authors":["Luis Pi√±a","Luis Veiga","Michael Hicks"],"meta":["December 2014ACM SIGPLAN Notices 49(10):103-119","DOI:10.1145/2660193.2660220"],"references":["262160706_Kitsune_Efficient_General-purpose_Dynamic_Software_Updating_for_C","260648605_Evaluating_Dynamic_Software_Update_Safety_Using_Systematic_Testing","254041830_A_study_of_dynamic_software_update_quiescence_for_multithreaded_programs","249948794_Toward_Practical_Dynamic_Software_Updating","228556492_ASM_A_code_manipulation_tool_to_implement_adaptable_systems","224001215_The_Java_Language_Specification","221303100_Dynamic_code_evolution_for_Java","221160561_Specifying_and_Verifying_the_Correctness_of_Dynamic_Software_Updates","220842710_Evolutionary_Data_Conversion_in_the_PJama_Persistent_Language","2349181_Evolutionary_Data_Conversion_in_the_PJama_Persistent_Language","311474956_Producing_wrong_data_without_doing_anything_obviously_wrong","290787266_Kitsune","271374719_Dynamic_software_updates","252066697_The_Garbage_Collection_Handbook_The_Art_of_Automatic_Memory_Management","241846121_Safe_and_Timely_Dynamic_Updates_for_Multi-threaded_Programs","241633051_Atomic_Dynamic_Upgrades_using_software_transactional_memory","221321094_Dynamics_Class_Loading_in_the_Java_Virtual_Machine","4251277_POLUS_A_POwerful_live_updating_system","2842367_Dynamic_Deployment_of_Java_Applications","2370880_Dynamic_Software_Updating"]}
