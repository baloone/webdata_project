{"id":"278711118_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","abstract":"Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (vanet) are a special kind of Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (manet) adapted to the communications between vehicles. Several specific protocols to vanets have been developed to improve performances and satisfy vehicular application needs. To evaluate a protocol for vanet, some realistic mobility models are needed. Unfortunately, such models are not provided by Opnet Modeler. In this work, we propose a framework that enhances Opnet Modeler simulation scenario using realistic vehicular mobility models. This framework makes use of the open source software called “Simulation of Urban MObility” (sumo) and the “input trajectory files” feature of Opnet Modeler.","authors":["Florent Kaisser","Christophe Gransart","Marion Berbineau"],"meta":["April 2012","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-29667-3_9","Conference: International Workshop on Communication Technologies for Vehicles"],"references":["228046314_A_survey_and_comparative_study_of_simulators_for_vehicular_ad_hoc_networks_VANETs","224097050_Achieving_broadcasting_efficiency_in_V2X_networks_with_a_distance-based_protocol","220926401_GrooveSim_A_Topography-Accurate_Simulator_for_Geographic_Routing_in_Vehicular_Networks","37453668_TraNS_Realistic_joint_traffic_and_network_simulator_for_VANETs","32896731_OpenStreetMap_User-Generated_Street_Maps","3885171_Disseminating_messages_among_highly_mobile_hosts_based_on_inter-vehicle_communication","1939813_Empirical_basis_for_car-following_theory_development","1783975_Congested_Traffic_States_in_Empirical_Observations_and_Microscopic_Simulations","259196541_Introduction_to_Modern_Traffic_Flow_Theory_and_Control_The_Long_Road_to_Three-Phase_Traffic_Theory","243392343_Introduction_to_Modern_Traffic_Flow_Theory_and_Control_The_Long_Road_to_Three-Phase_Traffic_Theory","225425699_An_Effective_Multi-hop_Broadcast_in_Vehicular_Ad-Hoc_Network","224795177_Microscopic_Modeling_of_Traffic_Flow_Investigation_of_Collision_Free_Vehicle_Dynamics","224712274_Rapid_Generation_of_Realistic_Mobility_Models_for_VANET","220926600_An_integrated_mobility_and_traffic_model_for_vehicular_wireless_networks","4345412_Simulating_the_influence_of_IVC_on_road_traffic_using_bidirectionally_coupled_simulators","3869391_GPS-based_message_broadcasting_for_inter-vehicle_communication"]}
