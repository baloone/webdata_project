{"id":"314620587_Applications_of_Link_Prediction","abstract":"Link prediction has a wide variety of applications. Graphs provide a natural abstraction to represent interactions between different entities in a network. We can have graphs representing social networks, transportation networks, disease networks, email/telephone calls network to list a few. Link prediction can specifically be applied on these networks to analyze and solve interesting problems like predicting outbreak of a disease, controlling privacy in networks, detecting spam emails, suggesting alternative routes for possible navigation based on the current traffic patterns, etc.","authors":["Virinchi Srinivas","Pabitra Mitra"],"meta":["January 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-28922-9_5","In book: Link Prediction in Social Networks (pp.57-61)"],"references":["276345539_Improving_Routing_Performance_in_AODV_with_Link_Prediction_in_Mobile_Adhoc_Networks","273536220_Recommendation_Algorithm_based_on_Link_Prediction_and_Domain_Knowledge_in_Retail_Transactions","258999878_Using_Link_Prediction_to_Estimate_the_Collaborative_Influence_of_Researchers","225107903_Densifying_a_Behavioral_Recommender_System_by_Social_Networks_link_prediction_methods","221297946_Towards_Discovery_of_Influence_and_Personality_Traits_through_Social_Link_Prediction","220505171_Link_Prediction_and_Route_Selection_Based_on_Channel_State_Detection_in_UASNs","4262332_A_Link_Prediction_Approach_to_Anomalous_Email_Detection","2369002_Item-based_Collaborative_Filtering_Recommendation_Algorithms","332626775_Controlling_privacy_with_trust-aware_link_prediction_in_online_social_networks","278689246_Link_Prediction_Approaches_for_Disease_Networks","262202142_Scalable_collaborative_filtering_using_incremental_update_and_local_link_prediction","261495032_Service_Recommendation_in_an_Evolving_Ecosystem_A_Link_Prediction_Approach","260673702_Link_availability_prediction-based_reliable_routing_for_mobile_ad_hoc_networks","222815507_A_link-indexed_statistical_traffic_prediction_approach_to_improving_IEEE_80211_PSM","221397656_A_Link_Prediction_Approach_to_Recommendations_in_Large-Scale_User-Generated_Content_Systems","221298076_Future_Link_Prediction_in_the_Blogosphere_for_Recommendation","221273565_Applying_Link_Prediction_to_Ranking_Candidates_for_High-Level_Government_Post","221140887_A_supervised_machine_learning_link_prediction_approach_for_academic_collaboration_recommendation","221096775_A_Supervised_Machine_Learning_Link_Prediction_Approach_for_Tag_Recommendation","220923912_Recommendation_as_link_prediction_A_graph_kernel-based_machine_learning_approach","220923878_Link_prediction_approach_to_collaborative_filtering","220717956_Finding_Experts_by_Link_Prediction_in_Co-authorship_Networks","4023954_Avoiding_route_breakage_in_ad_hoc_networks_using_link_prediction"]}
