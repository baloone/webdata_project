{"id":"351503113_Modeling_genome-wide_by_environment_interactions_through_omnigenic_interactome_networks","abstract":"How genes interact with the environment to shape phenotypic variation and evolution is a fundamental question intriguing to biologists from various fields. Existing linear models built on single genes are inadequate to reveal the complexity of genotype-environment (G-E) interactions. Here, we develop a conceptual model for mechanistically dissecting G-E interplay by integrating previously disconnected theories and methods. Under this integration, evolutionary game theory, developmental modularity theory, and a variable selection method allow us to reconstruct environment-induced, maximally informative, sparse, and casual multilayer genetic networks. We design and conduct two mapping experiments by using a desert-adapted tree species to validate the biological application of the model proposed. The model identifies previously uncharacterized molecular mechanisms that mediate treesâ€™ response to saline stress. Our model provides a tool to comprehend the genetic architecture of trait variation and evolution and trace the information flow of each gene toward phenotypes within omnigenic networks.","authors":["Haojie Wang","Ye Meixia","Yaru Fu","Ang Dong"],"meta":["May 2021Cell Reports 35(6):109114","DOI:10.1016/j.celrep.2021.109114"],"references":["345671696_SEGN_Inferring_real-time_gene_networks_mediating_phenotypic_plasticity","341794124_Genetic_basis_of_phenotypic_plasticity_and_genotype_x_environment_interaction_in_a_multi-parental_tomato_population","339918607_Quantification_of_the_overall_contribution_of_gene-environment_interaction_for_obesity-related_traits","339499833_Functional_QTL_mapping_and_genomic_prediction_of_canopy_height_in_wheat_measured_using_a_robotic_field_phenotyping_platform","339125125_Improved_genome_assembly_provides_new_insights_into_genome_evolution_in_a_desert_poplar_Populus_euphratica","337941288_Identification_of_Shoot_Differentiation-Related_Genes_in_Populus_euphratica_Oliv","336424297_An_omnidirectional_visualization_model_of_personalized_gene_regulatory_networks","347399387_The_GTEx_Consortium_atlas_of_genetic_regulatory_effects_across_human_tissues","344382576_Genes_and_environments_development_and_time","344232967_The_Genetic_Makeup_of_the_Electrocardiogram"]}
