{"id":"311459812_Reconfiguration_Analysis_of_a_Variable_Degrees-of-Freedom_Parallel_Manipulator_With_Both_3-DOF_Planar_and_4-DOF_3T1R_Operation_Modes","abstract":"Reconfiguration analysis is essential for the design and control of multi-operation-mode parallel manipulators (PMs). This paper deals with the reconfiguration analysis of a variable-DOF (degrees-of-freedom) multi-operation-mode E/PPPR = PM, i.e. a PM with both 3-DOF planar operation mode and 4-DOF 3T1R (or Schönflies motion which has three translational DOF and 1 rotational DOF) operation mode. The axes of rotation of the moving platform in the 3-DOF planar operation mode are not parallel to the axes of rotation of the moving platform in the 4-DOF 3T1R operation mode. In the reconfiguration analysis, the orientation of the moving platform is represented using a Euler parameter quaternion (also Euler-Rodrigues quaternion). The reconfiguration analysis shows that the E/PPPR = PM has two 4-DOF 3T1R operation modes and two 3-DOF planar operation modes, including the two expected operation modes. The transition configurations between each pair of operation modes are also identified.\nCopyright © 2016 by ASME Country-Specific Mortality and Growth Failure in Infancy and Yound Children and Association With Material Stature\nUse interactive graphics and maps to view and sort country-specific infant and early dhildhood mortality and growth failure data and their association with maternal","authors":["Xianwen Kong"],"meta":["August 2016","DOI:10.1115/DETC2016-59203","Conference: ASME 2016 International Design Engineering Technical Conferences and Computers and Information in Engineering Conference","Project: Miniature flexible & reconfigurable manufacturing system for 3D Micro-products” (EP/K018345/1), July 2013 - December 2017"],"references":["290395608_Reconfiguration_analysis_of_a_4-DOF_3-RER_parallel_manipulator_with_equilateral_triangular_base_and_moving_platform","284014093_Reconfiguration_analysis_of_a_4-RUU_parallel_manipulator","275383649_Mobility_Change_in_Two_Types_of_Metamorphic_Parallel_Mechanisms","275220356_Type_Synthesis_of_Two-Degrees-of-Freedom_3-4R_Parallel_Mechanisms_With_Both_Spherical_Translation_Mode_and_Sphere-on-Sphere_Rolling_Mode","273167146_Extra_Modes_of_Operation_and_Self-Motions_in_Manipulators_Designed_for_Schoenflies_Motion","270774962_Geometric_Constraint_and_Mobility_Variation_of_Two_3S_v_PS_v_Metamorphic_Parallel_Mechanisms","259508915_A_new_family_of_reconfigurable_parallel_mechanisms_with_diamond_kinematotropic_chain","259508712_Reconfiguration_analysis_of_a_3-DOF_parallel_mechanism_using_Euler_parameter_quaternions_and_algebraic_geometry_method","256934606_Geometry_Constraint_and_Branch_Motion_Evolution_of_3-PUP_Parallel_Mechanisms_with_Bifurcated_Motion","228563524_A_complete_kinematic_analysis_of_the_SNU_3-UPU_parallel_robot","224367149_Parallel_Mechanisms_With_Bifurcation_of_Schoenflies_Motion","220104085_Two-mode_overconstrained_three-DOFs_rotational-translational_linear-motor-based_parallel-kinematics_mechanism_for_machine_tool_applications","294708732_Virtual-Chain_Approach_for_the_Type_Synthesis_of_Parallel_Mechanisms","277680855_Type_Synthesis_of_3-DOF_Parallel_Manipulators_With_Both_a_Planar_Operation_Mode_and_a_Spatial_Translational_Operation_Mode_1","277249149_Type_Synthesis_of_3-DOF_multi-mode_translationalspherical_parallel_mechanisms_with_lockable_joints","267490246_Type_Synthesis_of_Variable_Degrees-of-Freedom_Parallel_Manipulators_With_Both_Planar_and_3T1R_Operation_Modes","263808717_Maximally_Regular_T2R1-Type_Parallel_Manipulators_With_Bifurcated_Spatial_Motion","259095950_Design_of_parallel_hybrid-loop_manipulators_with_kinematotropic_property_and_deployability","256934775_Mobility_and_kinematic_analysis_of_a_parallel_mechanism_with_both_PPR_and_planar_operation_modes","245366660_Kinematic_Analysis_and_Prototyping_of_a_Partially_Decoupled_4DOF_3T1R_Parallel_Manipulator","234040269_Type_Synthesis_of_Parallel_Mechanisms_With_Multiple_Operation_Modes","226224436_Parallel_robots_that_change_their_group_of_motion","223207100_Euler_Parameters_and_the_Use_of_Quaternion_Algebra_in_the_Manipulation_of_Finite_Rotations_A_Review"]}
