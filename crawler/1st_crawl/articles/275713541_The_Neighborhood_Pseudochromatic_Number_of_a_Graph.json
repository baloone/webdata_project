{"id":"275713541_The_Neighborhood_Pseudochromatic_Number_of_a_Graph","abstract":"A pseudocoloring of G is a coloring of G in which adjacent vertices can receive\nthe same color. The neighborhood pseudochromatic number of a non-trivial connected graph\nG, denoted nhd(G), is the maximum number of colors used in a pseudocoloring of G such\nthat every vertex has at least two vertices in its closed neighborhood receiving the same\ncolor. In this paper, we obtain nhd(G) of some standard graphs and characterize all graphs\nfor which nhd(G) is 1, 2, n âˆ’ 1 or n.","authors":["B.
