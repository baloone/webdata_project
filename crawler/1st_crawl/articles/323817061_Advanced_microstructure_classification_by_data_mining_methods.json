{"id":"323817061_Advanced_microstructure_classification_by_data_mining_methods","abstract":"The mechanical properties of modern multi-phase materials significantly depend on the distribution, the shape and the size of the microstructural constituents. Thus, quantification and classification of the microstructure are decisive in identifying the underlying structure-property relationship of a specific material. Due to the complexity of the microstructure in modern materials, a reliable classification of microstructural constituents remains one of the biggest challenges in metallography.\nThe present study demonstrates how data mining methods can be used to determine varying steel structures of two-phase steels by evaluating their morphological parameters.\nA data mining process was developed by using a support vector machine as classifier to build a model that is able to distinguish between different microstructures of the two-phase steels. The impact of preprocessing and feature selection methods on the classification result was tested.","authors":["Jessica Gola","Dominik Britz","Thorsten Staudt","Marc Winter"],"meta":["June 2018Computational Materials Science 148:324-335","DOI:10.1016/j.commatsci.2018.03.004"],"references":["317711703_Advanced_Steel_Microstructural_Classification_by_Deep_Learning_Methods","275840776_Topological_Approach_to_FerriteMartensite_Dual-phase_Microstructures"]}
