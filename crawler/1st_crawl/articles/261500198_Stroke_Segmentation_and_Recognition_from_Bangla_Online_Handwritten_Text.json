{"id":"261500198_Stroke_Segmentation_and_Recognition_from_Bangla_Online_Handwritten_Text","abstract":"This paper deals with recognition of online handwritten Bangla (Bengali) text. Here, at first, we segment cursive words into strokes. A stroke may represent a character or a part of a character. We selected a set of Bangla words written by different groups of people such that they contain all basic characters, all vowel and consonant modifiers and almost all types of possible joining among them. For segmentation of text into strokes, we discovered some rules analyzing different joining patterns of Bangla characters. Combination of online and offline information was used for segmentation. We achieved correct segmentation rate of 97.89% on the dataset. We manually analyzed different strokes to create a ground truth set of distinct stroke classes for result verification and we obtained 85 stroke classes. Directional features were used in SVM for recognition and we achieved correct stroke recognition rate of 97.68%.","authors":["Nilanjana Bhattacharya","Umapada Pal"],"meta":["September 2012","DOI:10.1109/ICFHR.2012.275","Conference: Frontiers in Handwriting Recognition (ICFHR), 2012 International Conference on","Project: Online Handwriting Recognition"],"references":["268813394_Online_Bangla_Handwriting_Recognition_System","267400889_An_Analytic_Scheme_for_Online_Handwritten_Bangla_Cursive_Word_Recognition","226658534_A_Tutorial_on_Support_Vector_Machines_for_Pattern_Recognition","221389501_Online_Bangla_Word_Recognition_Using_Sub-Stroke_Level_Features_and_Hidden_Markov_Models","220962283_A_Fuzzy_Technique_for_Segmentation_of_Handwritten_Bangla_Word_Images","3974235_Online_handwritten_Indian_script_recognition_A_human_motor_function_based_framework","304425264_A_Tutorial_on_Support_Vector_Machines_for_Pattern_Recognition","292986295_A_hidden_Markov_model_for_recognition_of_online_handwritten_Bangla_numerals","243763580_The_Nature_Of_Statistical_Learning_Theory","239761604_Handwriting_Recognition_in_Indian_Regional_Scripts_A_Survey_of_Offline_Techniques","232655858_On-line_Handwriting_Recognition_of_Indian_Scripts_-_The_First_Benchmark","232635991_Online_Handwritten_Indian_Script_Recognition_A_Human_Motor_Function_Based_Framework","224214287_Offline_Recognition_of_Devanagari_Script_A_Survey","221997066_The_Nature_of_Satistical_Learning_Theory","221389480_On-line_Handwriting_Recognition_of_Indian_Scripts_-_The_First_Benchmark","220860757_Segmentation_of_Bangla_Unconstrained_Handwritten_Text","200086000_A_Tutorial_on_Support_Vector_Machines_for_Pattern_Recognition","4288419_Direction_Code_Based_Features_for_Recognition_of_Online_Handwritten_Characters_of_Bangla","3817397_Segmentation_of_Bangla_handwritten_text_into_characters_byrecursive_contour_following"]}
