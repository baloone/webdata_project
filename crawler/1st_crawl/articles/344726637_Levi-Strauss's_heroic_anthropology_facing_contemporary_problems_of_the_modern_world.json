{"id":"344726637_Levi-Strauss's_heroic_anthropology_facing_contemporary_problems_of_the_modern_world","abstract":"Claude Lévi-Strauss, the founder of the structural revolution in anthropology, passed in October 2009. In the decade after his death, we are presented with a significant number of successive publications that celebrate both his work and life and the ever-lasting public engagement of his heroic anthropology with problems of the modern world. This extended review article is focused to deal with these works in relation to contemporary issues, which is not already so well known for Lévi-Strauss and which can make a point to restore him to a central position of importance not merely in the history of anthropology but also in the public engagement of current anthropology.","authors":["Albert Doja"],"meta":["September 2020Reviews in Anthropology 49(1-2):4-38","DOI:10.1080/00938157.2020.1794140"],"references":["346055752_Celebrations_of_Levi-Strauss's_Heroic_Legacy","328923440_Politics_of_mass_rapes_in_ethnic_conflict_a_morphodynamics_of_raw_madness_and_cooked_evil","344653448_The_Mushroom_at_the_End_of_the_World_On_the_Possibility_of_Life_in_Capitalist_Ruins","341751773_Les_structures_elementaires_de_la_parente","334725850_Levi-Strauss_Two_lives","331300566_The_Mushroom_at_the_End_of_the_World_On_the_Possibility_of_Life_in_Capitalist_Ruins","327411619_Productivite_et_condition_humaine","325148364_We_Are_All_Cannibals_and_Other_Essays_by_Claude_Levi-Strauss","324359731_Anthropologie_structurale","323321278_The_traffic_in_women_Notes_on_the_'political_economy'_of_sex"]}
