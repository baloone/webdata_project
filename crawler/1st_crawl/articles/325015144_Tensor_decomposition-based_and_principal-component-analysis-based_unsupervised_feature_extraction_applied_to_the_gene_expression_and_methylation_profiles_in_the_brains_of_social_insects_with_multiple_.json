Epigenomic profiles may represent key factors, with unknown contributions to the development of multiple phenotypes, and social-insect castes are a good model for elucidation of the underlying mechanisms. Nonetheless, previous studies have failed to identify genes associated with aberrant gene expression and methylation profiles because of the lack of suitable methodology that can address this problem properly.\n\n**Methods**\nA recently proposed principal component analysis (PCA)-based and tensor decomposition (TD)-based unsupervised feature extraction (FE) can solve this problem because these two approaches can deal with gene expression and methylation profiles even when a small number of samples is available.\n\n**Results**\nPCA-based and TD-based unsupervised FE methods were applied to the analysis of gene expression and methylation profiles in the brains of two social insects, Polistes canadensis and Dinoponera quadriceps. Genes associated with differential expression and methylation between castes were identified, and analysis of enrichment of Gene Ontology terms confirmed reliability of the obtained sets of genes from the biological standpoint.\n\n**Conclusions**\nBiologically relevant genes, shown to be associated with significant differential gene expression and methylation between castes, were identified here for the first time. The identification of these genes may help understand the mechanisms underlying epigenetic control of development of multiple phenotypes under the same genomic conditions.","authors":["Y-h.
