{"id":"283761478_Characterizing_Concept_Drift","abstract":"Most machine learning models are static, but the world is dynamic, and\nincreasing online deployment of learned models gives increasing urgency to the\ndevelopment of efficient and effective mechanisms to address learning in the\ncontext of non-stationary distributions, or as it is commonly called concept\ndrift. However, the key issue of characterizing the different types of drift\nthat can occur has not previously been subjected to rigorous definition and\nanalysis. In particular, while some qualitative drift categorizations have been\nproposed, few have been formally defined, and the quantitative descriptions\nrequired for detailed understanding of learner performance have not existed. We\npresent the first comprehensive framework for quantitative analysis of drift.\nThis supports the development of the first comprehensive set of formal\ndefinitions of types of concept drift. The formal definitions clarify\nambiguities and identify gaps in previous definitions, giving rise to a new\ncomprehensive taxonomy of concept drift types and a solid foundation for\nresearch into mechanisms to detect and address concept drift.","authors":["Geoffrey I Webb","Roy Hyde","Hong Cao","Hai-Long Nguyen"],"meta":["July 2016Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery 30(4)","DOI:10.1007/s10618-015-0448-4","SourcearXiv","Project: Concept Drift Definition"],"references":["280733059_Mining_Data_Streams_with_Concept_Drift","280733051_Prequential_AUC_for_Classifier_Evaluation_and_Drift_Detection_in_Evolving_Data_Streams","269776374_A_Survey_on_Data_Stream_Clustering_and_Classification","263714256_Open_Challenges_for_Data_Stream_Mining_Research","344498293_Types_and_Tokens_On_Abstract_Objects","313750911_The_impact_of_diversity_on_online_ensemble_learning_in_the_presence_of_concept_drift","297613506_Tracking_Drift_Types_in_Changing_Data_Streams","287227692_Recovery_Analysis_for_Adaptive_Learning_from_Non-stationary_Data_Streams","271425800_A_review_on_real_time_data_stream_classification_and_adapting_to_various_concept_drift_scenarios","268690944_Recovery_analysis_for_adaptive_learning_from_non-stationary_data_streams_Experimental_design_and_case_study","261961254_A_Survey_on_Concept_Drift_Adaptation","260354251_Reacting_to_Different_Types_of_Concept_Drift_The_Accuracy_Updated_Ensemble_Algorithm","257807029_Learning_from_streaming_data_with_concept_drift_and_imbalance_An_overview","257786591_Introduction_to_the_special_issue_on_handling_concept_drift_in_adaptive_information_systems","261122134_Concept_drift_detection_for_online_class_imbalance_learning"]}
