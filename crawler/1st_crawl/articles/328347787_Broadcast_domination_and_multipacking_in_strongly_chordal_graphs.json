{"id":"328347787_Broadcast_domination_and_multipacking_in_strongly_chordal_graphs","abstract":"A linear programming algorithm to compute the broadcast domination number and the multipacking number of a strongly chordal graph is described. It runs in time cubic in the number of vertices of the input graph. A new linear-time algorithm to find the broadcast domination number of a tree is given, as is a simplified linear algorithm to find the multipacking number of a tree.","authors":["Richard C.
