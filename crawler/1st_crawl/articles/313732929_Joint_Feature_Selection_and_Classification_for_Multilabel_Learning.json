{"id":"313732929_Joint_Feature_Selection_and_Classification_for_Multilabel_Learning","abstract":"Multilabel learning deals with examples having multiple class labels simultaneously. It has been applied to a variety of applications, such as text categorization and image annotation. A large number of algorithms have been proposed for multilabel learning, most of which concentrate on multilabel classification problems and only a few of them are feature selection algorithms. Current multilabel classification models are mainly built on a single data representation composed of all the features which are shared by all the class labels. Since each class label might be decided by some specific features of its own, and the problems of classification and feature selection are often addressed independently, in this paper, we propose a novel method which can perform joint feature selection and classification for multilabel learning, named JFSC. Different from many existing methods, JFSC learns both shared features and label-specific features by considering pairwise label correlations, and builds the multilabel classifier on the learned low-dimensional data representations simultaneously. A comparative study with state-of-the-art approaches manifests a competitive performance of our proposed method both in classification and feature selection for multilabel learning.","authors":["Jun Huang","Guorong Li","Qingming Huang","Xindong Wu"],"meta":["February 2017IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics PP(99):1-14","DOI:10.1109/TCYB.2017.2663838"],"references":["308576427_Categorizing_feature_selection_methods_for_multi-label_classification","284561053_Ensemble_constrained_Laplacian_score_for_efficient_and_robust_semi-supervised_feature_selection","283980717_Multi-view_ensemble_learning_An_optimal_feature_set_partitioning_for_highdimensional_data_classification","283943199_Multi-graph-view_subgraph_mining_for_graph_classification","281637736_Leveraging_Implicit_Relative_Labeling-Importance_Information_for_Effective_Multi-Label_Learning","273463169_A_Multiobjective_Genetic_Programming-Based_Ensemble_for_Simultaneous_Feature_Selection_and_Classification","270337594_A_Tutorial_on_Multi-Label_Learning","267154292_Multilabel_Learning_A_Review_of_the_State_of_The_Art_and_Ongoing_Research","263813673_A_Review_On_Multi-Label_Learning_Algorithms","260350278_Web_Image_Annotation_Via_Subspace-Sparsity_Collaborated_Feature_Selection","257618443_Beam_search_algorithms_for_multilabel_learning","233387868_Efficient_Monte_Carlo_Methods_for_Multi-Dimensional_Learning_with_Classifier_Chains","228058014_Pattern_Classification","227319967_Classifier_Chains_for_Multi-label_Classification","226649250_Random_k-Labelsets_An_Ensemble_Method_for_Multilabel_Classification","225986997_Mining_Multi-label_Data","221996079_An_Introduction_of_Variable_and_Feature_Selection","221618060_Efficient_and_Robust_Feature_Selection_via_Joint_l2_1-Norms_Minimization","221618029_A_Dirty_Model_for_Multi-task_Learning","313418906_Bayes_optimal_multilabel_classification_via_probabilistic_classifier_chains","313394814_Leveraging_implicit_relative_labeling-_importance_information_for_effective_multi-label_learning","309176340_Effective_and_Efficient_Multi-label_Feature_Selection_Approaches_via_Modifying_Hilbert-Schmidt_Independence_Criterion","309080650_Feature_Selection_Through_Message_Passing","309056065_Learning_Label-Specific_Features_and_Class-Dependent_Labels_for_Multi-Label_Classification","307881957_LIBSVM_A_library_for_support_vector_machines","307584295_Graph-Margin_Based_Multi-label_Feature_Selection","304824205_Regression_Shrinkage_and_Selection_via_the_LASSO","304821782_A_novel_attribute_reduction_approach_for_multi-label_data_based_on_rough_set_theory","304288853_Learning_Label_Specific_Features_for_Multi-label_Classification","301761347_Multi-label_learning_with_label-specific_feature_reduction","301240253_Label_Propagation_via_Teaching-to-Learn_and_Learning-to-Teach","297743322_Task_Sensitive_Feature_Exploration_and_Learning_for_Multitask_Graph_Classification","297659790_Weakly_Supervised_Multilabel_Clustering_and_its_Applications_in_Computer_Vision","293640753_Learning_Instance_Correlation_Functions_for_Multilabel_Classification","292680219_A_Multi-label_Feature_Extraction_Algorithm_via_Maximizing_Feature_Variance_and_Feature-Label_Dependence_Simultaneously","286461955_A_convex_formulation_for_semi-supervised_multi-label_feature_selection","286116664_Research_of_label-specific_features_on_multi-label_learning_algorithm","279216094_Bayes-Optimal_Hierarchical_Multilabel_Classification","276542773_Soft-Constrained_Laplacian_score_for_semi-supervised_multi-label_feature_selection","273064550_Block-Row_Sparse_Multiview_Multilabel_Learning_for_Image_Classification","271923160_Context-aware_MIML_instance_annotation_exploiting_label_correlations_with_classifier_chains","266310934_Motoda_H_Feature_Selection_for_Knowledge_Discovery_and_Data_Mining_Kluwer_Academic_USA","261317692_Multi-label_ReliefF_and_F-statistic_feature_selections_for_image_annotation","260538405_Approximating_mutual_information_for_multi-label_feature_selection","251421209_GMLC_A_multi-label_feature_selection_framework_for_graph_classification","241697384_Image_Annotation_By_Multiple-Instance_Learning_With_Discriminative_Feature_Mapping_and_Selection","222709440_ML-KNN_A_lazy_learning_approach_to_multi-label_leaming","222578995_Feature_selection_for_multi-label_naive_Bayes_classification","222430151_Learning_multi-label_scene_classification","221619768_A_Kernel_Method_for_Multi-Labelled_Classification","221572702_Correlative_multi-label_video_annotation","220815110_Lift_Multi-Label_Learning_with_Label-Specific_Features","220766063_Multi-label_Classification_Using_Ensembles_of_Pruned_Sets","220699681_Knowledge_Discovery_in_Multi-Label_Phenotype_Data","220345150_Multilabel_Dimensionality_Reduction_via_Dependence_Maximization"]}
