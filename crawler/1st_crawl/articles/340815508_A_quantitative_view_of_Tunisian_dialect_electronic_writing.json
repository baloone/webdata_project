{"id":"340815508_A_quantitative_view_of_Tunisian_dialect_electronic_writing","abstract":"With technological development and the emergence of advanced forms of communication such as chat and SMS, a new form of writing, having high deviation from standard language, has appeared. This paper focuses specifically on electronic writing with Latin letters in Tunisian dialect. We describe the methodology used for the construction of a dialectal corpus, present the characteristics of this new form of writing and detail its peculiarities with numbers. The built corpus, consisting of 43,222 messages, will be available to the NLP community. It will allow researchers, working on the Tunisian dialect and social media messages, to generate more indicators in order to better deal with this new form of writing.","authors":["Jihene Younes","Emna Souissi"],"meta":["November 2014","Conference: Fifth International Conference on Arabic Language Processing (CITALA 2014)At: Morocco"],"references":["265396773_Transcrire_les_SMS_comme_on_reconnait_la_parole","242690948_Paysage_linguistique_en_Tunisie_Le_francais_a-t-il_perdu_de_sa_suprematie","238729678_Le_rapport_a_l'ecriture_un_outil_pour_penser_la_place_de_l'ecriture_electronique_dans_l'enseignement-apprentissage_du_francais","221102822_Normalizing_SMS_are_Two_Metaphors_Better_than_One","313038781_Pluringuisme_et_diglossie_en_Tunisie","292715810_Le_traitement_des_nouvelles_formes_de_communication_ecrite","241185775_Arabic_Dialect_Identification","200823231_Le_langage_SMS_revelateur_d'1competence","47655261_La_communication_mediatisee_par_ordinateur_ou_la_communication_mediee_par_ordinateur"]}
