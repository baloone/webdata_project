{"id":"312542623_Simulation_and_virtual_reality-based_learning_of_non-technical_skills_in_driving_critical_situations_diagnostic_and_adaptation","abstract":"Project MacCoy Critical aims to study and to improve training systems using simulation and virtual environments in medical education (obstetrics) and in driving education (novice drivers during the first months of autonomous driving). The paper describes and justifies the main concepts, the approach and the architecture elaborated from a multidisciplinary viewpoint in order to provide more appropriate and flexible Virtual Environments for Learning/Training to support the acquisition of Non-Technical Skills (NTS) by Humans. This is illustrated in the domain of driving education.","authors":["Jean-Marie Burkhardt","Valentin Corneloup","C.
