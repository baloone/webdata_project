{"id":"336264234_Local_Convergence_Analysis_of_the_Levenberg-Marquardt_Framework_for_Nonzero-Residue_Nonlinear_Least-Squares_Problems_Under_an_Error_Bound_Condition","abstract":"The Levenberg–Marquardt method is widely used for solving nonlinear systems of equations, as well as nonlinear least-squares problems. In this paper, we consider local convergence properties of the method, when applied to nonzero-residue nonlinear least-squares problems under an error bound condition, which is weaker than requiring full rank of the Jacobian in a neighborhood of a stationary point. Differently from the zero-residue case, the choice of the Levenberg–Marquardt parameter is shown to be dictated by (i) the behavior of the rank of the Jacobian and (ii) a combined measure of nonlinearity and residue size in a neighborhood of the set of (possibly non-isolated) stationary points of the sum of squares function.","authors":["Roger Behling","Douglas Soares Gonçalves","Sandra Augusta Santos"],"meta":["December 2019Journal of Optimization Theory and Applications 183(1)","DOI:10.1007/s10957-019-01586-9"],"references":["325563452_On_an_Elliptical_Trust-Region_Procedure_for_Ill-Posed_Nonlinear_Least-Squares_Problems","301645438_Algebraic_rules_for_computing_the_regularization_parameter_of_the_Levenberg-Marquardt_method","277962950_Hybrid_Levenberg-Marquardt_and_weak_constraint_ensemble_Kalman_smoothermethod","273525444_Nonlinear_ill-posed_problem_analysis_in_model-based_parameter_estimation_and_experimental_design","317670005_A_Limited_Memory_BFGS_method_for_a_nonlinear_inverse_problem_in_digital_breast_tomosynthesis","309698218_1983_Numerical_methods_for_unconstrained_optimization_and_nonlinear_equations_Prentice-Hall","301347279_Hybrid_Levenberg-Marquardt_and_weak-constraint_ensemble_Kalman_smoother_method","281547284_Nonlinear_least_squares","266860504_Rank-Deficient_Nonlinear_Least_Squares_Problems_and_Subset_Selection","266043586_Advanced_Calculus_of_Several_Variables","265310012_Matrix_computations_4th_ed","264423290_Solving_Least_Square_Problems","260873044_Regularized_solution_of_a_nonlinear_problem_in_electromagnetic_sounding","257731181_A_variational_approach_of_the_rank_function","257479846_The_effect_of_calmness_on_the_solution_set_of_systems_of_nonlinear_equations"]}
