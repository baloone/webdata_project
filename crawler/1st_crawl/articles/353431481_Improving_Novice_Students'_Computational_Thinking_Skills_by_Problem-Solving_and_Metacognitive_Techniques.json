{"id":"353431481_Improving_Novice_Students'_Computational_Thinking_Skills_by_Problem-Solving_and_Metacognitive_Techniques","abstract":"Admittedly, the teaching and learning of programming courses in the computer science and information technology programs have been extremely challenging. Currently, most instructors depend on either the problem-solving technique or the metacognitive technique to help students develop a range of cognitive skills, including metacognitive skills, which are important in the development of a strong computational thinking skill required for 21st-century learning. Studies focusing on the practices of instructors in using both techniques are scarce, thus motivating the researchers to carry out this study. This study was based on a qualitative approach involving a case-study design in which five (5) male and five (5) female instructors were selected from 10 pre-university centers in Malaysia as the respondents and participants in an intervention program. The research instruments used were an interview checklist and intervention guidelines. As anticipated, the findings showed that the activities of each technique could only help students develop certain sub-skills of the computational thinking skill, thus underscoring the need for instructors to integrate both techniques in their teaching practices. Thus, it could be reasoned that using either the metacognitive technique or the problem-solving technique alone would not be sufficient to help students develop strong computational thinking skills, as each technique has its strengths and weaknesses. Therefore, it becomes imperative for instructors to leverage the strengths of both techniques by integrating both of them in the teaching and learning of programming courses.","authors":["Ubaidullah Nor Hasbiah","Zulkifley Mohamed","Jamilah Hamid","Suliana Sulaiman"],"meta":["June 2021","DOI:10.26803/ijlter.20.6.5"],"references":["341298625_Measurement_of_Metacognition_Adaptation_of_Metacognitive_State_Inventory_in_Spanish_to_Mexican_University_Students","339821965_An_Analysis_of_Pre-service_Teachers'_Learning_Process_in_Programming_Learning","333485927_INTRODUCING_COMPUTATIONAL_THINKING_PRACTICES_IN_LEARNING_SCIENCE_OF_ELEMENTARY_SCHOOL","332568240_The_Effectiveness_of_Inquiry-based_Learning_to_Train_the_Students'_Metacognitive_Skills_Based_on_Gender_Differences","324886429_Preliminary_Investigation_Teachers'_Perception_on_Computational_Thinking_Concepts","321751410_Computational_thinking_development_through_creative_programming_in_higher_education","339817484_Technology_Integration_to_Promote_Desire_to_Learn_Programming_in_Higher_Education","321243261_Developing_Metacognitive_Skills_A_Potential_Intervention_for_Employability_Enhancement","318600661_Changing_a_Generation's_Way_of_Thinking_Teaching_Computational_Thinking_Through_Programming","317158625_Remaining_trouble_spots_with_computational_thinking","316661206_Metacognitive_Skills_of_Malaysian_Students_in_Non-Routine_Mathematical_Problem_Solving","312172848_Impact_of_a_New_Teaching_and_Learning_Approach_in_an_Introductory_Programming_Course","316627086_Computational_Thinking_in_pre-university_Blended_Learning_classrooms","308654282_Which_cognitive_abilities_underlie_computational_thinking_Criterion_validity_of_the_Computational_Thinking_Test","305628802_From_computational_thinking_to_computational_participation_in_K--12_education"]}
