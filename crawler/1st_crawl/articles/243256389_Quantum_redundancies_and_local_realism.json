{"id":"243256389_Quantum_redundancies_and_local_realism","abstract":"The basic properties of quantum redundancies are presented. The previous definitions of the informationally coherent quantum (ICQ) system are generalized in terms of the redundancies. The ICQ systems are also considered in the context of local realism in terms of the information integrity factor Î·. The classical region for the two classes of mixed, nonfactorizable states admitting the local hidden variable model is found.","authors":["R Horodecki"],"meta":["January 1994Physics Letters A 194:147-152","DOI:10.1016/0375-9601(94)90289-5"],"references":["13243740_Maximal_violation_of_Bell_inequalities_for_mixed_states","259264515_Bell_inequalities_and_quantum_mechanics","243470326_Correlation_Inequalities_and_Hidden_Variables","222759241_The_Bell_and_GHZ_theorems_a_possible_three-photon_interference_experiment_and_the_question_of_nonlocality","222630154_Informationally_coherent_quantum_systems","222469430_Ten_theorems_about_quantum_mechanical_measurements","13385798_Quantum_states_with_Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen_correlations_admitting_a_hidden-variable_model","13382836_Information_theory_squeezing_and_quantum_correlations","13232975_Bell's_inequalities_versus_teleportation_What_is_nonlocality"]}
