{"id":"257506866_Simulation_of_Effective_Subshifts_by_Two-dimensional_Subshifts_of_Finite_Type","abstract":"In this article we study how a subshift can simulate another one, where the notion of simulation is given by operations on subshifts inspired by the dynamical systems theory (factor, projective subaction …). There exists a correspondence between the notion of simulation and the set of forbidden patterns. The main result of this paper states that any effective subshift of dimension d—that is a subshift whose set of forbidden patterns can be generated by a Turing machine—can be obtained by applying dynamical operations on a subshift of finite type of dimension d+1—a subshift that can be defined by a finite set of forbidden patterns. This result improves Hochman’s (Invent. Math. 176(1):131–167, 2009).","authors":["Nathalie Aubrun","Mathieu Sablik"],"meta":["August 2013Acta Applicandae Mathematicae 126(1)","DOI:10.1007/s10440-013-9808-5"],"references":["228924570_Classification_of_sofic_projective_subdynamics_of_multidimensional_shifts_of_finite_type","260321318_Open_problems_in_symbolic_dynamics","242463956_The_Undecidability_of_the_Domino_Problem","233151536_Symbolic_dynamics_of_tree_maps","230641335_Symbolic_Dynamics_One_Sided_Two_Sided_and_Countable_State_Markov_Shifts","230641324_An_Introduction_to_Symbolic_Dynamics_and_Coding","227305287_Tilings_substitution_systems_and_dynamical_systems_generated_by_them","226606019_Undecidability_and_Nonperiodicity_for_Tilings_of_the_Plane","225977813_On_the_dynamics_and_recursive_properties_of_multidimensional_symbolic_systems","220691187_Theory_of_recursive_functions_and_effective_computability_Reprint_from_1967"]}
