They can be measured and quantified using the inventory of basic computer science education. Using a sample of 428 students from three high schools and one middle school, at least a partial invariance of the scalar measurement between girls and boys as well as learners with and without attended computer science classes could be demonstrated. This made it possible to compare the latent means of the three scales of the inventory between the groups. The results showed slight to medium effects for the first and second basic experience and no significant differences for the third basic experience. For the third basic experience, however, there was a slight negative dependency on age.","authors":["Andreas Kiener"],"meta":["December 2020"],"references":["340130830_Entwicklung_eines_Messinstruments_zu_den_Grunderfahrungen_des_Informatikunterrichts","320679287_Students'_Misconceptions_and_Other_Difficulties_in_Introductory_Programming_A_Literature_Review","259998496_Notional_Machines_and_Introductory_Programming_Education","258192143_A_Brief_Guide_to_Structural_Equation_Modeling","323424582_Statistical_power_analysis_for_the_behavioral_sciences","309032267_Cutoff_criteria_for_fit_indexes_in_covariance_structure_analysis_Conventional_criteria_versus_new_alternatives","304715242_Measurement_Invariance_Conventions_and_Reporting_The_State_of_the_Art_and_Future_Directions_for_Psychological_Research","303919046_Principles_and_Practice_of_Structural_Equation_Modeling","289963080_Point_Estimation_Hypothesis_Testing_and_Interval_Estimation_Using_the_RMSEA_Some_Comments_and_a_Reply_to_Hayduk_and_Glaser","264894426_Sample_Size_Requirement_for_Unbiased_Estimation_of_Structural_Equation_Models_A_Monte_Carlo_Study","255978774_Does_the_Way_in_which_Students_Use_Computers_Affect_their_Performance","254345399_Reporting_Structural_Equation_Modeling_and_Confirmatory_Factor_Analysis_Results_A_Review","251060246_Evaluating_the_Fit_of_Structural_Equation_Models_Tests_of_Significance_and_Descriptive_Goodness-of-Fit_Measures","234021997_A_Review_and_Synthesis_of_the_Measurement_Invariance_Literature_Suggestions_Practices_and_Recommendations_for_Organizational_Research","233253342_Evaluating_Goodness-of-Fit_Indexes_for_Testing_Measurement_Invariance"]}
