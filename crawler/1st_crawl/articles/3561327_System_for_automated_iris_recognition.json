{"id":"3561327_System_for_automated_iris_recognition","abstract":"This paper describes a prototype system for personnel verification\nbased on automated iris recognition. The motivation for this endeavour\nstems from the observation that the human iris provides a particularly\ninteresting structure on which to base a technology for noninvasive\nbiometric measurement. In particular, it is known in the biomedical\ncommunity that irises are as distinct as fingerprints or patterns of\nretinal blood vessels. Further, since the iris is an overt body its\nappearance is amenable to remote examination with the aid of a computer\nvision system. The body of this paper details the design and operation\nof such a system. Also presented are the results of an empirical study\nwhere the system exhibits flawless performance in the evaluation of 520\niris images","authors":["Richard Wildes","J.C. Asmuth","G.L.
