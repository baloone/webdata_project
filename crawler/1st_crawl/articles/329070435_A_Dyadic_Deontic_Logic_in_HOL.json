{"id":"329070435_A_Dyadic_Deontic_Logic_in_HOL","abstract":"A shallow semantical embedding of a dyadic deontic logic by Carmo and Jones in classical higher-order logic is presented. This embedding is proven sound and complete, that is, faithful. The work presented here provides the theoretical foundation for the implementation and automation of dyadic deontic logic within o-the-shelf higher-order theorem provers and proof assistants.","authors":["Christoph Benzm√ºller","Ali Farjami","Xavier Parent"],"meta":["July 2018","Conference: DEON 2018At: Utrecht, Netherlands","Projects: Normative Reasoning and Machine EthicsStudies in Computational Metaphysics"],"references":["323392435_Faithful_Semantical_Embedding_of_a_Dyadic_Deontic_Logic_in_HOL","293488069_Cut-Elimination_for_Quantified_Conditional_Logic","265799418_Completeness_and_decidability_results_for_a_logic_of_contrary-to-duty_conditionals","260000943_Automation_of_Higher-Order_Logic","221677897_Quantified_Multimodal_Logics_in_Simple_Type_Theory","221234924_Nitpick_A_Counterexample_Generator_for_Higher-Order_Logic_Based_on_a_Relational_Model_Finder","279428707_Deontic_Logic","243768985_Deontic_Logic_and_Contrary-to-Duties","243728066_Contrary-To-Duty_Imperatives_and_Deontic_Logic","242484403_An_Unsolvable_Problem_of_Elementary_Number_Theory"]}
