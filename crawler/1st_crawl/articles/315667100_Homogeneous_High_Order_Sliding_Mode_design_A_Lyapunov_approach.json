{"id":"315667100_Homogeneous_High_Order_Sliding_Mode_design_A_Lyapunov_approach","abstract":"We provide a Lyapunov-based design of High-Order Sliding Mode (HOSM) Control of arbitrary order for a class of Single-Input-Single-Output uncertain nonlinear systems. First we provide a general method to design degree homogeneous controllers based on a homogeneous Control Lyapunov Function (CLF). Then, for a perturbed chain of integrators we construct a smooth and homogeneous CLF and use it to design a family of homogeneous and discontinuous control laws. The controller drives in finite time the trajectories of the system to a sliding surface of arbitrary relative degree, and keeps the trajectories on this manifold despite persistently acting matched perturbations, so that a sliding mode is established. We obtain a large and simply parametrized family of “usual” discontinuous and quasi-continuous HOSM controllers of nested and polynomial type, that share the robustness and accuracy properties of the existing ones.","authors":["Emmanuel Cruz-Zavala","Jaime A Moreno"],"meta":["June 2017Automatica 80:232 - 238","DOI:10.1016/j.automatica.2017.02.039"],"references":["304410703_New_families_of_high-order_sliding-mode_controllers","293194602_Simple_homogeneous_sliding-mode_controller","285329104_High-order_sliding_modes_Differentiation_and_output_feedback_control","268239893_A_new_class_of_fast_finite-time_discontinuous_controllers","261484098_On_an_extension_of_homogeneity_notion_for_differential_inclusions","261466137_Robust_and_adaptive_Higher_Order_Sliding_mode_controllers","254057753_Strict_Lyapunov_Functions_for_the_Super-Twisting_Algorithm","253785103_Higher-order_sliding_modes_differentiation_and_output-feedback_control","251806428_Quasicontinuous_high-order_sliding-mode_controllers","239064283_Sliding_Order_and_Sliding_Accuracy_in_Sliding_Mode_Control","225561225_Lyapunov_Approach_for_Analysis_and_Design_of_Second_Order_Sliding_Mode_Algorithms","224567371_Reaching_Time_Estimation_for_Super-Twisting_Second_Order_Sliding_Mode_Controller_via_Lyapunov_Function_Designing","224367928_A_Lyapunov_approach_to_second-order_sliding_mode_controllers_and_observers","222597726_Finite_time_stability_and_stabilization_of_a_class_of_continuous_systems","222414512_Levant_A_Homogeneity_approach_to_high-order_sliding_mode_design_Automatica_415_823-830","41708516_Control_Lyapunov_functions_for_homogeneous_Jurdjevic-Quinn_systems","24142720_Homogeneous_Approximation_Recursive_Observer_Design_and_Output_Feedback","3032243_Quasi-continuous_high-order_sliding-mode_controllers","3024164_Universal_SISO_Sliding-Mode_Controllers_with_Finite-Time_Convergence","3020910_Lyapunov_design_of_stabilizing_controllers_for_cascaded_systems","323725551_Discontinuous_systems_Lyapunov_analysis_and_robust_synthesis_under_uncertainty_conditions","316912478_Lyapunov_functions_for_homogeneous_differential_inclusions","301435792_Improved_Convergence_Rate_of_Discontinuous_Finite-Time_Controllers","294684340_Differential_Equations_with_Discontinuous_Righthand_Sides","286159393_Improved_convergence_rate_of_discontinuous_finite-time_controllers","279350161_Sliding_Mode_Control_and_Observation","274635672_Inequalities","272700042_Calculus_of_Variations_and_Optimal_Control_Theory","271141391_Robust_Stabilization_of_MIMO_Systems_in_FiniteFixed_Time","267928734_Finite-time_and_fixed-time_stabilization_Implicit_Lyapunov_function_approach","267150010_Discontinuous_Systems-Lyapunov_Analysis_and_Robust_Synthesis_Under_Uncertainty_Conditions","266239430_Unified_Lyapunov_function_for_a_finite-time_stability_analysis_of_relay_second-order_sliding_mode_control_systems","265806465_Robust_Nonlinear_Control_Design_State-Space_and_Lyapunov_Techniques","265458580_Multivalued_Differential_Equation","264634433_Peaking_free_output-feedback_exact_tracking_of_uncertain_nonlinear_systems_via_dwell-time_and_norm_observers","264235520_Liapunov_Functions_and_Stability_in_Control_Theory","263130986_Sliding_Mode_Control_in_Electro-Mechanical_Systems","260028400_On_Homogeneity_and_Its_Application_in_Sliding_Mode_Control","259118583_Verification_of_ISS_iISS_and_IOSS_properties_applying_weighted_homogeneity","245218058_Finite-Time_Stabilization_and_Stabilizability_of_a_Class_of_Nonlinear_Systems","227629124_Adjustment_of_high-order_sliding-mode_controllers","222837989_Global_finite-time_stabilization_of_a_class_of_uncertain_nonlinear_Systems","222479166_Homogenous_Lyapunov_function_for_homogenous_continuous_vector_field","220159735_Lyapunov_function_design_for_finite-time_convergence_analysis_Twisting_controller_for_second-order_sliding_mode_realization","30846679_Geometric_homogeneity_with_application_to_finite-time_stability","4013053_Lyapunov_Functions_for_Homogeneous_Differential_Inclusions","3024112_A_continuous_feedback_approach_to_global_stabilization_of_nonlinear_systems"]}
