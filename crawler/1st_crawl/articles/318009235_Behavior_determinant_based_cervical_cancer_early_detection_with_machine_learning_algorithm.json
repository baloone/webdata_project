{"id":"318009235_Behavior_determinant_based_cervical_cancer_early_detection_with_machine_learning_algorithm","abstract":"Cervical cancer (Ca Cervix) is serious public health problem in women in the world. Fortunately, this disease is preventable. Current prevention method remains low both in the result and participation. So, prevention or early detection method still open and challenging. Behavior and its determinant are promising as Ca Cervix predictor and event as early detection. To date, there is still limited amount of research conducted in Ca Cervix detection based on behavior and machine learning in the combination of the field of public health and computer science. In this study, machine learning is used as classifier to detect the probability of Ca Cervix risk based on behavior and its determinant. Two popular machine learning, Na√Øve Bayes (NB) and Logistic Regression (LR) are used as classifier. From the experimental result, both NB and LR are promising as classifier to detect Ca Cervix risk based on behavior and its determinant with accuracy 91.67% and 87.5% respectively and with AUC 0.96 and 0.97 respectively.","authors":["Sobar","R.
