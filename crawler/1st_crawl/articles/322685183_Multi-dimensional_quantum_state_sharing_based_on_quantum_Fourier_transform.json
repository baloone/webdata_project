{"id":"322685183_Multi-dimensional_quantum_state_sharing_based_on_quantum_Fourier_transform","abstract":"A scheme of multi-dimensional quantum state sharing is proposed. The dealer performs the quantum SUM gate and the quantum Fourier transform to encode a multi-dimensional quantum state into an entanglement state. Then the dealer distributes each participant a particle of the entanglement state, to share the quantum state among n participants. In the recovery, n- 1 participants measure their particles and supply their measurement results; the last participant performs the unitary operation on his particle according to these measurement results and can reconstruct the initial quantum state. The proposed scheme has two merits: It can share the multi-dimensional quantum state and it does not need the entanglement measurement.
