A new path planner addresses this problem by combining Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT) and a set representation of uncertain states. An idealized algorithm is presented first, before a description of one of its possible implementations, where compact sets are wrapped into boxes. The resulting path planner is then used for nonholonomic path planning in robotics.","authors":["Romain Pepy","Michel Kieffer","Eric Walter"],"meta":["September 2009International Journal of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science 19(3):413-424","DOI:10.2478/v10006-009-0034-2","SourceDBLP"],"references":["313645872_An_efficient_algorithm_for_determining_the_convex_hull_of_a_finite_planar_set","311925874_Guaranteed_state_estimation_by_zonotopes","281076071_Guaranteed_Set_Computation_with_Subpavings","279389547_Robot_Motion_Planning","273129945_Interval_Analysis","273129880_Applied_Interval_Analysis_Springer_London","265709263_Computation_of_Guaranteed_Enclosures_for_the_Solutions_of_Ordinary_Initial_and_Boundary_Value_Problems","256181708_Graham_RL_An_Efficient_Algorithm_for_Determining_the_Convex_Hull_of_a_Finite_Planar_Set_Information_Processing_Letters_1_132-133","247330158_Randomized_Kinodynamic_Planning","247161853_Robot_Motion_Planning"]}
