{"id":"336388646_Students_learning_as_researchers_of_curriculum_in_an_undergraduate_programme","abstract":"This article analyses an approach to student researchers of their curriculum as a module in an undergraduate initial teacher education programme. It shows the rationale for bringing such curriculum research into a taught programme to widen the range of possible participants. Rather than the outcomes of the student researcher project, the article presents the student researchersâ€™ learning from this module to show how it contributes to becoming researchers. It shows how the module was constructed and enacted as an innovation within a taught programme. Data from module learning activities show that students as researchers of curriculum can be successfully included in a taught programme. The open pedagogy encouraged reflective thinking, engagement in learning, and taking ownership. The appreciative approach shows that undergraduates are capable of organising and managing their own learning and so become more engaged in their studies and those of their peers.","authors":["Charly Ryan"],"meta":["October 2019Innovations in Education and Teaching International 57(6):1-11","DOI:10.1080/14703297.2019.1673201"],"references":["331950757_Collaboration_between_staff_and_students_in_the_scholarship_of_teaching_and_learning_The_potential_and_the_problems","306096509_Education_for_transformation_an_evaluative_framework_to_guide_student_voice_work_in_schools","301380694_Developing_the_student_as_a_researcher_through_the_curriculum","290503014_The_student-as-consumer_approach_in_higher_education_and_its_effects_on_academic_performance","279951804_Can_reflective_practice_be_taught","276417578_Addressing_potential_challenges_in_co-creating_learning_and_teaching_overcoming_resistance_navigating_institutional_norms_and_ensuring_inclusivity_in_student-staff_partnerships","275106885_Students_as_Partners_Embracing_the_New_Paradigm_in_Mathematics","272381302_Democratizing_Teacher_Education","271928526_The_student_voice_in_higher_education_curriculum_design_is_there_value_in_listening","267945200_STUDENTS_AS_New_ways_of_engaging_with_learning_and_teaching_in_Higher_Education_CHANGE_AGENTS","264240134_Engagement_through_partnership_students_as_partners_in_learning_and_teaching_in_higher_education","242609326_The_Effectiveness_of_Nominal_Delphi_and_Interacting_Group_Decision_Making_Processes","233298860_Student_voice_Theorising_power_and_participation","232984034_Doing_Student_Voice_Work_in_Higher_Education_An_Exploration_of_the_Value_of_Participatory_Methods","232924512_Students_as_co-creators_of_teaching_approaches_course_design_and_curricula_Implications_for_academic_developers","226245307_Patterns_of_Partnership_Student_Voice_Intergenerational_Learning_and_Democratic_Fellowship","325002381_The_Effectiveness_of_Nominal_Delphi_and_Interacting_Group_Decision_Making_Processes","308493942_Development_of_the_UK_engagement_survey","276880186_An_alternative_grading_tool_for_enhancing_assessment_practice_and_quality_assurance_in_higher_education","275515717_Becoming_Teachers_Becoming_Researchers_a_Case_Study","269576483_Who_Counts_The_Quiet_Revolution_of_Participation_and_Numbers","266422140_Rethinking_the_values_of_higher_education_-consumption_partnership_community","266150705_Engaging_students_and_staff_with_educational_development_through_appreciative_inquiry","263538837_An_investigation_of_co-created_curricula_within_higher_education_in_the_UK_Ireland_and_the_USA","261290677_Flexibility_compromise_and_opportunity_Students'_perceptions_of_balancing_part-time_work_with_a_full-time_business_degree","259811991_Going_URBN_exploring_the_impact_of_undergraduate_students_as_pedagogic_researchers","254304447_Complexity_science_and_professional_learning_for_collaboration_A_critical_reconsideration_of_possibilities_and_limitations","249019612_Creating_case_studies_of_practice_through_Appreciative_Inquiry","241711944_From_learning_to_development_A_sociocultural_approach_to_instruction","233642252_Learning_from_Other_People_in_the_Workplace","233265490_'It_feels_more_important_than_other_classes_I_have_done'_An_'authentic'_undergraduate_research_experience_in_sociology","232826880_Crossing_the_threshold_from_description_to_deconstruction_and_reconstruction_Using_self-assessment_to_deepen_reflection"]}
