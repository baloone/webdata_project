{"id":"282000474_Randomised_Enumeration_of_Small_Witnesses_Using_a_Decision_Oracle","abstract":"Many combinatorial problems involve determining whether a universe of $n$\nelements contains a witness consisting of $k$ elements which have some\nspecified property. In some cases it is necessary to consider the entire\nuniverse in order to determine whether a given subset is a witness, but in\nothers it suffices to consider only the elements of the witness themselves, and\nthe relationships between them. We are concerned with the problem of finding\n\\emph{all} witnesses in the latter case: we show that, if the corresponding\ndecision problem belongs to FPT, there is a randomised algorithm to enumerate\nall witnesses in time $f(k)\\cdot poly(n) \\cdot N$, where $N$ is the total\nnumber of objects to be enumerated and $f$ is a computable function. This also\ngives rise to an efficient algorithm to count the total number of witnesses\nwhen this number is small.","authors":["Kitty Meeks"],"meta":["February 2019Algorithmica 81(4)","DOI:10.1007/s00453-018-0404-y","SourcearXiv"],"references":["308036255_Paradigms_for_Parameterized_Enumeration","282298868_Engineering_Motif_Search_for_Large_Graphs","281318029_Probably_optimal_graph_motifs","281058712_Fast_Witness_Extraction_Using_a_Decision_Oracle","321620239_Parameterized_Complexity_Theory","281740143_Some_Hard_Families_of_Parameterized_Counting_Problems","281565143_Parameterized_Enumeration_for_Modification_Problems","272391953_The_parameterised_complexity_of_counting_connected_subgraphs_and_graph_motifs","266856414_The_parameterised_complexity_of_counting_even_and_odd_induced_subgraphs","265502171_Fundamentals_of_Parameterized_Complexity"]}
