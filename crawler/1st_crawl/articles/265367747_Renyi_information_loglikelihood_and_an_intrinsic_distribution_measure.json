{"id":"265367747_Renyi_information_loglikelihood_and_an_intrinsic_distribution_measure","abstract":"Rényi information of order λ for a continuous random variable is considered and its connection to the loglikelihood is established. From this relation, an intrinsic loglikelihood-based distribution measure is proposed. It is derived from the gradient of the spectrum of Rényi information and it can be represented, in the case of important parametric families, by a single function – the trigamma function. Serving as a measure of the shape of a distribution, can be used to compare the tails and shapes of various frequently used densities, whereas the traditional kurtosis measure is not applicable, including many heavy-tailed distributions such as Student's t with any degree of freedom, Cauchy, Cramér, Lévy and Pareto distributions. A nonparametric procedure of estimating the measure is also developed and its strong consistency is established.","authors":["Kai-Sheng Song"],"meta":["February 2001Journal of Statistical Planning and Inference 93(1)","DOI:10.1016/S0378-3758(00)00169-5"],"references":["10731622_Quantitative_analysis_of_heart_rate_variability","288841406_On_measures_of_entropy_and_information","283591825_Bounds_of_the_minimal_error_probability_on_checking_a_finite_or_countable_number_of_hypo_thesis","271815937_Moment_Distributions_in_Economics_An_Exposition","254909414_Convex_Transformation_of_Random_Variables","246792696_Measures_of_Multivariate_Skewness_and_Kurtosis_with_Applications","246659422_Laws_of_Small_Numbers_Extremes_and_Rare_Events","243082114_Nonparametric_Roughness_Penalties_for_Probability_Densities","230675451_Some_Fundamental_Questions_of_Information_Theory","226926038_Global_statistical_information_in_exponential_experiments_and_selection_of_exponential_models","224043320_Handbook_of_Matematical_Functions","223106857_f-entropies_probability_of_error_and_feature_selection","220022168_On_the_dimension_and_entropy_of_probability_distributions","200524441_On_measures_of_entropy_and_information","38361777_A_Law_of_the_Logarithm_for_Kernel_Density_Estimators","38357994_Descriptive_Statistics_for_Nonparametric_Models_I_Introduction","23631178_Some_New_Statistics_for_Testing_Hypotheses_in_Parametric_Models"]}
