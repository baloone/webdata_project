{"id":"320032927_Data_and_Task_Based_Effectiveness_of_Basic_Visualizations","abstract":"Visualizations of tabular data are widely used; understanding their effectiveness in different task and data contexts is fundamental to scaling their impact. However, little is known about how basic tabular data visualizations perform across varying data analysis tasks and data attribute types. In this paper, we report results from a crowdsourced experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of five visualization types --- Table, Line Chart, Bar Chart, Scatterplot, and Pie Chart --- across ten common data analysis tasks and three data attribute types using two real world datasets. We found the effectiveness of these visualization types significantly varies across task and data attribute types, suggesting that visualization design would benefit from considering context dependent effectiveness. Based on our findings, we derive recommendations on which visualizations to choose based on different task and data contexts.","authors":["Bahador Saket","Alex Endert","Çağatay Demiralp"],"meta":["September 2017IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics PP(99)","DOI:10.1109/TVCG.2018.2829750"],"references":["307855254_How_maps_work_Representation_Visualization_Design","305767722_VLAT_Development_of_a_Visualization_Literacy_Assessment_Test","303767566_Graphs_versus_numbers_How_information_format_affects_risk_aversion_in_gambling","301935708_Towards_Understanding_Human_Similarity_Perception_in_the_Analysis_of_Large_Sets_of_Scatter_Plots","294891134_A_Comparative_Evaluation_on_Online_Learning_Approaches_using_Parallel_Coordinate_Visualization","282046588_Beyond_Weber's_Law_A_Second_Look_at_Ranking_Visualizations_of_Correlation","281096837_Investigating_aspects_of_data_visualization_literacy_using_20_information_visualizations_and_273_science_museum_visitors","301462085_DataTone_Managing_Ambiguity_in_Natural_Language_Interfaces_for_Data_Visualization","289963533_Graphical_perception_Theory_experimentation_and_application_to_the_development_of_graphical_methods","289540500_When_ish_is_My_Bus_User-centered_Visualizations_of_Uncertainty_in_Everyday_Mobile_Predictive_Systems"]}
