{"id":"273697660_THE_IMPACT_OF_STRUCTURED_DISCUSSION_FORUMS_ON_KNOWLEDGE_ACQUISITION_OF_DIFFERENT_KINDS_BY_COMPUTER_SCIENCE_STUDENTS","abstract":"Asynchronous discussion forums have been examined for their usefulness in promoting online\nlearning among students. This study proposed a structure for discussion forums and investigated its\nimpact on computer science students' acquisition of different kinds of knowledge: know-what, knowhow,\nand know-why. The study employed a field experiment using pre- and post-tests for evaluating\nthe knowledge level by the students in the three knowledge kinds before and after the participation in\nthe online course. One hundred twenty three students from two academic education colleges\nparticipated in seven computer science online courses. The main findings of the study showed that:\n(1) students of the structured discussion forum acquired more knowledge of the kinds \"how\" and \"why\"\ncompared to the students who participated in the unstructured discussion forum; and (2) the obtained\ndifferences in knowledge acquisition were also dependent on the student's prior knowledge of subject\nmatter. The findings of the study can contribute to the field of asynchronous online learning in\nproviding a structure for discussion forums that has the potential to enhance knowledge acquisition of\ndifferent kinds by the students.","authors":["Moanes H.
