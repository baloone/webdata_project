{"id":"200772533_Exploratory_Social_Network_Analysis_With_Pajek","abstract":"This is an extensively revised and expanded second edition of the successful textbook on social network analysis integrating theory, applications, and network analysis using Pajek. The main structural concepts and their applications in social research are introduced with exercises. Pajek software and data sets are available so readers can learn network analysis through application and case studies. Readers will have the knowledge, skill, and tools to apply social network analysis across the social sciences, from anthropology and sociology to business administration and history. This second edition has a new chapter on random network models, for example, scale-free and small-world networks and Monte Carlo simulation; discussion of multiple relations, islands, and matrix multiplication; new structural indices such as eigenvector centrality, degree distribution, and clustering coefficients; new visualization options that include circular layout for partitions and drawing a network geographically as a 3D surface; and using Unicode labels. This new edition also includes instructions on exporting data from Pajek to R software. It offers updated descriptions and screen shots for working with Pajek (version 2.03).","authors":["Wouter de Nooy","Andrej Mrvar","Vladimir Batagelj"],"meta":["January 2004Psychometrika 71(3)","DOI:10.1017/CBO9780511806452","Publisher: Cambridge University PressISBN: 9780521841733","Project: Analysis of large networks"],"references":[]}
