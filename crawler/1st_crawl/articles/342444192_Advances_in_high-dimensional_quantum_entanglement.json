{"id":"342444192_Advances_in_high-dimensional_quantum_entanglement","abstract":"Since its discovery, quantum entanglement has challenged some of the best established views of the world: locality and reality. Quantum technologies promise to revolutionize computation, communication, metrology and imaging. Here we review conceptual and experimental advances in complex entangled systems involving many multilevel quantum particles. We provide an overview of the latest technological developments in the generation and manipulation of high-dimensionally entangled photonic systems encoded in various discrete degrees of freedom such as path, transverse spatial modes or timeâ€“frequency bins. This overview should help to transfer various physical principles for the generation and manipulation from one degree of freedom to another and thus inspire new technical developments. We also show how purely academic questions and curiosity led to new technological applications. Fundamental research provides the necessary knowledge for upcoming technologies, such as a prospective quantum internet or the quantum teleportation of all information stored in a quantum system. Finally, we discuss some important problems in the area of high-dimensional entanglement and give a brief outlook on possible future developments.","authors":["Manuel Erhard","Mario Krenn","Anton Zeilinger"],"meta":["June 2020","DOI:10.1038/s42254-020-0193-5"],"references":["343406149_Unscrambling_entanglement_through_a_complex_medium","343241687_Computer-Inspired_Concept_for_High-Dimensional_Multipartite_Quantum_Gates","340180443_Three-dimensional_entanglement_on_a_silicon_chip","338559403_Quantum_information_processing_with_space-division_multiplexing_optical_fibres","338128089_Chip-to-chip_quantum_teleportation_and_multi-photon_entanglement_in_silicon","337781863_Quantum-Enhanced_Advanced_LIGO_Detectors_in_the_Era_of_Gravitational-Wave_Astronomy","337555085_Overcoming_Noise_in_Entanglement_Distribution","335508905_Quantum_circuits_for_maximally_entangled_states","334992034_Programmable_four-photon_graph_states_on_a_silicon_chip","334975592_Towards_optimal_single-photon_sources_from_polarized_microcavities","334706386_Ghost_imaging_using_entanglement-swapped_photons","334155325_Generation_and_sampling_of_quantum_states_of_light_in_a_silicon_chip","334023425_Orbital_Angular_Momentum_States_Enabling_Fiber-based_High-dimensional_Quantum_Communication","333435444_Imaging_with_quantum_states_of_light","332680373_Laguerre-Gaussian_mode_sorter","332526295_Cyclic_permutations_for_qudits_in_d_dimensions","331086343_Arbitrary_d_-dimensional_Pauli_X_gates_of_a_flying_qudit","329602892_Quantum_state_engineering_with_twisted_photons_via_adaptive_shaping_of_the_pump_beam","329594124_Coherent_manipulation_of_a_three-dimensional_maximally_entangled_state","329383921_Realization_of_a_scalable_Laguerre-Gaussian_mode_sorter_based_on_a_robust_radial_mode_sorter","329372566_High-dimensional_one-way_quantum_processing_implemented_on_d-level_cluster_states","328847144_Postselection-Loophole-Free_Bell_Violation_with_Genuine_Time-Bin_Entanglement","328581919_Experimental_Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger_entanglement_beyond_qubits","327119007_Large-scale_silicon_quantum_photonics_implementing_arbitrary_two-qubit_processing","326526754_Beating_the_channel_capacity_limit_for_superdense_coding_with_entangled_ququarts","325452327_Simulating_the_vibrational_quantum_dynamics_of_molecules_using_photonics","346677539_Optical_Coherence_and_Quantum_Optics","338129606_High-dimensional_quantum_gates_using_full-field_spatial_modes_of_photons","338032086_Boson_Sampling_with_20_Input_Photons_and_a_60-Mode_Interferometer_in_a_1_0_14_-Dimensional_Hilbert_Space","337784291_Ground-to-satellite_quantum_teleportation","336759783_Experimental_Measurement-Device-Independent_Quantum_Steering_and_Randomness_Generation_Beyond_Qubits","336712896_Integrated_photonic_quantum_technologies","336622434_Deterministic_generation_of_a_two-dimensional_cluster_state","336001973_Quantum_teleportation_of_photonic_qudits_using_linear_optics","335212862_Three-Photon_Discrete-Energy-Entangled_W_State_in_an_Optical_Fiber","335200697_Quantum_Teleportation_in_High_Dimensions","332915388_Demonstration_of_chip-to-chip_quantum_teleportation","332826269_Arbitrary_two-particle_high-dimensional_Bell-state_measurement_by_auxiliary_entanglement","332708642_Using_all_transverse_degrees_of_freedom_in_quantum_communications_based_on_a_generic_mode_sorter","331456199_Laguerre-Gaussian_mode_sorter","331265281_Quantum_optical_microcombs","329850619_12-Photon_Entanglement_and_Scalable_Scattershot_Boson_Sampling_with_Optimal_Entangled-Photon_Pairs_from_Parametric_Down-Conversion","329789019_Entanglement_certification_from_theory_to_experiment","328549683_88_Programmable_Quantum_Photonic_Processor_based_on_Silicon_Nitride_Waveguides","327365266_Measuring_the_orbital_angular_momentum_of_a_single_photon","327365170_Entanglement_of_the_orbital_angular_momentum_states_of_photons","327364904_Orbital_angular_momentum_of_light_and_the_transformation_of_Laguerre-Gaussian_laser_modes","327089588_Quantum_cryptography_with_twisted_photons_through_an_outdoor_underwater_channel","327077919_Quantum_cryptography_with_structured_photons_through_a_vortex_fiber","324930444_Design_of_High_Order_Mode-Multiplexers_using_Multiplane_Light_Conversion","323684948_Multidimensional_quantum_entanglement_with_large-scale_integrated_optics","322589799_50-GHz-spaced_comb_of_high-dimensional_frequency-bin_entangled_photons_from_an_on-chip_silicon_nitride_microresonator","322498402_18-qubit_entanglement_with_photon's_three_degrees_of_freedom","323130140_On_the_Einstein_Podolsky_Rosen_paradox","322517705_Satellite-Relayed_Intercontinental_Quantum_Network"]}
