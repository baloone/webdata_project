{"id":"313841402_Weighted_Stress_Function_Method_for_Multiobjective_Evolutionary_Algorithm_Based_on_Decomposition","abstract":"Multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) is a well established state-of-the-art framework. Major concerns that must be addressed when applying MOEA/D are the choice of an appropriate scalarizing function and setting the values of main control parameters. This study suggests a weighted stress function method (WSFM) for fitness assignment in MOEA/D. WSFM establishes analogy between the stress-strain behavior of thermoplastic vulcanizates and scalarization of a multiobjective optimization problem. The experimental results suggest that the proposed approach is able to provide a faster convergence and a better performance of final approximation sets with respect to quality indicators when compared with traditional methods. The validity of the proposed approach is also demonstrated on engineering problems.","authors":["Roman Denysiuk","Antonio Gaspar-Cunha"],"meta":["March 2017Lecture Notes in Computer Science 10173:176-190","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-54157-0_13","Conference: International Conference on Evolutionary Multi-Criterion OptimizationAt: MÃ¼nster, GermanyVolume: 10173 of LNCS","Project: Optimization using Evolutionary Algorihms"],"references":["311175259_A_tutorial_on_tbe_performance_assessment_of_stochastic_multiobjective_optimizers","280063760_MOEAVAN_Multiobjective_Evolutionary_Algorithm_Based_on_Vector_Angle_Neighborhood","274310050_MOEAPC_Multiobjective_Evolutionary_Algorithm_Based_on_Polar_Coordinates","302560124_A_fast_elitist_multi-objective_genetic_algorithm_NSGA-II","282555983_Constrained_Subproblems_in_a_Decomposition-Based_Multiobjective_Evolutionary_Algorithm","277634558_Are_All_the_Subproblems_Equally_Important_Resource_Allocation_in_Decomposition_Based_Multiobjective_Evolutionary_Algorithms","274317736_Adaptive_replacement_strategies_for_MOEAD","273296140_An_Evolutionary_Many-Objective_Optimization_Algorithm_Based_on_Dominance_and_Decomposition","272929205_Nonlinear_Multiobjective_Optimization","267982364_An_Evolutionary_Many-Objective_Optimization_Algorithm_Based_on_Dominance_and_Decomposition"]}
