{"id":"288926837_coUML_A_Visual_Language_for_Modeling_Cooperative_Environments","abstract":"In this chapter we present coUML, a visual modeling language for cooperative environments. As modern instructional environments have a highly cooperative nature, coUML is proposed as a powerful and effective language for modeling instructional designs in such environments. Being based on UML, it was conceived and refined through application and experience over multiple years, primarily in a cooperative blended learning environment. We present relevant requirements and applications that contributed to the development of coUML, as well as a detailed specification of model elements, characteristics and features that describe its current state.","authors":["Michael Derntl","Renate Motschnig-Pitrik"],"meta":["January 2007","DOI:10.4018/978-1-59904-729-4.ch009"],"references":["228630349_A_classification_framework_for_educational_modeling_languages_in_instructional_design","4123962_Modeling_context-aware_e-learning_scenarios"]}
