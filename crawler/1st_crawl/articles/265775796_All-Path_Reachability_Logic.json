{"id":"265775796_All-Path_Reachability_Logic","abstract":"This paper presents a language-independent proof system for reachability properties of programs written in non-deterministic (e.g. concurrent) languages, referred to as all-path reachability logic. It derives partial-correctness properties with all-path semantics (a state satisfying a given precondition reaches states satisfying a given postcondition on all terminating execution paths). The proof system takes as axioms any unconditional operational semantics, and is sound (partially correct) and (relatively) complete, independent of the object language; the soundness has also been mechanized (Coq). This approach is implemented in a tool for semantics-based verification as part of the \\(\\mathbb K\\) framework.","authors":["Andrei Ştefănescu","Ştefan Ciobâcă","Radu Mereuta","Brandon M.
