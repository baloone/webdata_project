{"id":"321451417_Statistical_Literacy_Reasoning_and_Learning_A_Commentary","abstract":"Similarities and differences in the articles by Rumsey, Garfield and Chance are summarized. An alternative perspective on the distinction between statistical literacy, reasoning, and thinking is presented. Based on this perspective, an example is provided to illustrate how literacy, reasoning and thinking can be promoted within a single topic of instruction. Additional examples of assessment items are offered. I conclude with implications for statistics education research that stem from the incorporation of recommendations made by Rumsey, Garfield and Chance into classroom practice.","authors":["Robert Claude delMas"],"meta":["January 2002Journal of Statistics Education 10(3)","DOI:10.1080/10691898.2002.11910679"],"references":["280385231_An_Activity-Based_Statistics_Course","275848747_The_Assessment_Challenge_in_Statistics_Education","273097022_Activity-Based_Statistics_Student_Guide","264954327_Activity-based_statistics_Student_guide_Revised_by_Tim_Erickson_2nd_revised_ed"]}
