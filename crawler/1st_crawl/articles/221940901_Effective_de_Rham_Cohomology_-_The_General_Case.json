{"id":"221940901_Effective_de_Rham_Cohomology_-_The_General_Case","abstract":"Grothendieck has proved that each class in the de Rham cohomology of a smooth\ncomplex affine variety can be represented by a differential form with\npolynomial coefficients. We prove a single exponential bound on the\ndegrees of these polynomials for varieties of arbitrary dimension.\nMore precisely, we show that the p-th de Rham\ncohomology of a smooth affine variety of dimension m and degree D can be\nrepresented by differential forms of degree (pD)^{O(pm)}. This result is\nrelevant for the algorithmic computation of the cohomology, but is also\nmotivated by questions in the theory of ordinary differential equations related\nto the infinitesimal Hilbert 16th problem.","authors":["Peter Scheiblechner"],"meta":["November 2018Communications in Contemporary Mathematics 21(05)","DOI:10.1142/S0219199718500670","SourcearXiv"],"references":["264965602_On_the_number_of_zeros_of_Abelian_integrals_A_constructive_solution_of_the_infinitesimal_Hilbert_sixteenth_problem","344884188_Sur_L'Homologie_des_Varietes_Algebriques_Reelles","321516067_Algorithms_in_Real_Algebraic_Geometry","316800400_Graduate_Texts_in_Mathematics","265682626_On_the_Periods_of_Certain_Rational_Integrals_II","265544257_User's_Guide_to_Spectral_Sequences","264960013_Kahler_Differentials","264549987_Filtration_de_Hodge_et_par_l'ordre_du_pole_pour_les_hypersurfaces_singulieres","264548505_On_the_De_Rham_Cohomology_of_a_Hypersurface_Complement","264548387_On_the_Milnor_fibrations_of_weighted_homogeneous_polynomials","253234005_Effective_Hironaka_resolution_and_its_complexity","257158336_Elements_de_geometrie_algebrique","257158005_On_the_de_rham_cohomology_of_algebraic_varieties","247043121_On_the_Milnor_fibration_of_weighted_homogeneous_polynomials","246104698_Etude_locale_des_schemas_et_des_morphismes_de_schemas"]}
