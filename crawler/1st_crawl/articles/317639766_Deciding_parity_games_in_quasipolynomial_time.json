{"id":"317639766_Deciding_parity_games_in_quasipolynomial_time","abstract":"It is shown that the parity game can be solved in quasipolynomial time. The parameterised parity game â with n nodes and m distinct values (aka colours or priorities) â is proven to be in the class of fixed parameter tractable (FPT) problems when parameterised over m. Both results improve known bounds, from runtime nO(ân) to O(nlog(m)+6) and from an XP-algorithm with runtime O(nÎ(m)) for fixed parameter m to an FPT-algorithm with runtime O(n⁵)+g(m), for some function g depending on m only. As an application it is proven that coloured Muller games with n nodes and m colours can be decided in time O((mm Â· n)⁵); it is also shown that this bound cannot be improved to O((2m Â· n)c), for any c, unless FPT = W[1].","authors":["Cristian S.
