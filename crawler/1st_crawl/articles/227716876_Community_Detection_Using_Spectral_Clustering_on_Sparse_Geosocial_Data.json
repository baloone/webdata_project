{"id":"227716876_Community_Detection_Using_Spectral_Clustering_on_Sparse_Geosocial_Data","abstract":"In this article we identify social communities among gang members in the\nHollenbeck policing district in Los Angeles, based on sparse observations of a\ncombination of social interactions and geographic locations of the individuals.\nThis information, coming from LAPD Field Interview cards, is used to construct\na similarity graph for the individuals. We use spectral clustering to identify\nclusters in the graph, corresponding to communities in Hollenbeck, and compare\nthese with the LAPD's knowledge of the individuals' gang membership. We discuss\ndifferent ways of encoding the geosocial information using a graph structure\nand the influence on the resulting clusterings. Finally we analyze the\nrobustness of this technique with respect to noisy and incomplete data, thereby\nproviding suggestions about the relative importance of quantity versus quality\nof collected data.","authors":["Yves van Gennip","Blake Hunter","Raymond Ahn","Peter Elliott"],"meta":["June 2012SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics 73(1)","DOI:10.2307/23479865","SourcearXiv","Project: Inferring Structure and Forecasting Dynamics on Evolving Networks"],"references":["263387106_The_Ecology_of_Gang_Territorial","257885094_An_Estimate_Score_Algorithm_for_simultaneous_parameter_estimation_and_reconstruction_of_incomplete_data_on_social_networks","237075823_Spatializing_Social_Networks_Using_Social_Network_Analysis_to_Investigate_Geographies_of_Gang_Rivalry_Territoriality_and_Violence_in_Los_Angeles","236726435_No_Sign_until_the_Burst_of_Fire_Understanding_the_Pakistan-Afghanistan_Frontier","313487833_A_tutorial_on_spectral_clustering","307534542_Algorithm_AS_136_A_K-means_vlustering_algorithm","267187074_Diffuse_Interface_Models_on_Graphs_for_Classification_of_High_Dimensional_Data","244416746_A_Stable_and_Efficient_Algorithm_for_the_Rank-One_Modification_of_the_Symmetric_Eigenproblem","241717254_The_Accidental_Guerrilla_Fighting_Small_Wars_in_the_Midst_of_a_Big_One","234801250_A_Tutorial_on_Spectral_Clustering"]}
