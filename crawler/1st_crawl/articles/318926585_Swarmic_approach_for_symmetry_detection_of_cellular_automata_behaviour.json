{"id":"318926585_Swarmic_approach_for_symmetry_detection_of_cellular_automata_behaviour","abstract":"Since the introduction of cellular automata in the late 1940s they have been used to address various types of problems in computer science and other multidisciplinary fields. Their generative capabilities have been used for simulating and modelling various natural, physical and chemical phenomena. Besides these applications, the lattice grid of cellular automata has been providing a by-product interface to generate graphical contents for digital art creation. One important aspect of cellular automata is symmetry, detecting of which is often a difficult task and computationally expensive. In this paper a swarm intelligence algorithm—Stochastic Diffusion Search—is proposed as a tool to identify points of symmetry in the cellular automata-generated patterns.","authors":["Mohammad Ali Javaheri Javid","Wajdi Alghamdi","Anna Ursyn","Robert Zimmer"],"meta":["October 2017Soft Computing 21(3):1-15","DOI:10.1007/s00500-017-2752-y","Project: Analysis of information gain and Kolmogorov complexity for structural evaluation of cellular automata configurations"],"references":["282682689_An_informational_model_for_cellular_automata_aesthetic_measure","267771708_The_Stochastic_Search_Network","267738029_Detecting_Symmetry_in_Cellular_Automata_Generated_Patterns_Using_Swarm_Intelligence","262223109_Stochastic_Diffusion_Search_Review","258430980_Human_facial_beauty_-_Averageness_symmetry_and_parasite_resistance","257788396_Creativity_and_Autonomy_in_Swarm_Intelligence_Systems","257779635_Information_sharing_impact_of_stochastic_diffusion_search_on_differential_evolution_algorithm","321542568_Designing_Beauty_The_Art_of_Cellular_Automata","310750241_Efficient_fitness_estimation_in_noisy_environments","274079001_An_Introduction_to_Formal_Languages_and_Automata"]}
