{"id":"308992094_Complexity_of_Routing_Problems_with_Release_Dates_and_Deadlines","abstract":"The desire of companies to offer same-day delivery leads to interesting new routing optimization problems. We study the complexity of single depot dispatching problems in which a delivery to a customer must occur within a pre-specified time after the customer places the order. Thus, each order has a release date (when the order is ready for dispatch from the depot) and a service guarantee that implies a deadline (when the order needs to be delivered). A vehicle delivering an order cannot depart the depot before the order is released, and must arrive at the customer at or before the order's deadline. We show that single and multiple vehicle variants where customers are located on a half-line can be solved to optimality in polynomial time. This setting, as well as our results, generalize those found in Archetti et al. (2015). We also provide algorithms with improved computational complexity for single vehicle variants without service deadlines.","authors":["Luis Damian Reyes Rodriguez","Alan Erera","Martin Savelsbergh"],"meta":["October 2016European Journal of Operational Research 266(1)","DOI:10.1016/j.ejor.2017.09.020","Project: Dynamic Dispatch Planning"],"references":["257196300_A_review_of_dynamic_vehicle_routing_problems","303404602_The_One-Dimensional_Dynamic_Dispatch_Waves_Problem","281146180_Dynamic_Vehicle_Routing_Problems_Three_Decades_and_Counting","280680581_Complexity_of_routing_problems_with_release_dates","226714458_A_dynamic_vehicle_routing_problem_with_multiple_delivery_routes","46491804_Dynamic_pickup_and_delivery_problems"]}
