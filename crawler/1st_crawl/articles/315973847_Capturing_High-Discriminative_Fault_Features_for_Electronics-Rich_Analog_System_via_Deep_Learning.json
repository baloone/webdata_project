{"id":"315973847_Capturing_High-Discriminative_Fault_Features_for_Electronics-Rich_Analog_System_via_Deep_Learning","abstract":"Fault detection and isolation (FDI) is very difficult for electronics-rich analog systems due to its sophisticated mechanism and variable operational conditions. Traditionally, FDI in such systems is done through the monitoring of deviation of output signals in voltage or current at system level, which commonly arises from the degradation of one or more critical components. Therefore, FDI can be transformed to a multi-class classification task given the extracted features of the output signals in voltage or current of the circuit. Traditional feature extraction on the circuit output are mostly based on time-domain, frequencydomain, or time-frequency signal processing, which collapse high dimensional raw signals into a lower dimensional feature set. Such low dimensional feature set usually suffers from information loss so as to affect the accuracy of the later fault diagnosis. In order to retain as much information as possible, deep learning is proposed which employs a hierarchical structure to capture different levels of semantic representations of the signals. In this paper, a novel fault diagnostic application of Gaussian-Bernoulli deep belief network (GB-DBN) for electronics-rich analog systems is developed which can more effectively capture the high order semantic features within the raw output signals. The novel fault diagnosis is validated experimentally on two typical analog filter circuits. Experimental results show the fault diagnosis based on GB-DBN is with superior diagnostic performance than the traditional feature extraction methods.","authors":["Zhenbao Liu","Zhen Jia","Chi-Man
