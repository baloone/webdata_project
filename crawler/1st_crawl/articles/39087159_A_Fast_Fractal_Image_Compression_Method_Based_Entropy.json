{"id":"39087159_A_Fast_Fractal_Image_Compression_Method_Based_Entropy","abstract":"Fractal image compression gives some desirable properties like resolution independence, fast decoding, and very competitive rate-distortion curves. But still suffers from a (sometimes very) high encoding time, depending o n the approach being used. This paper presents a method to reduce the encoding time of this technique by reducing the size of the domain pool based on the Entropy value of each domain block. Experimental results on standard images show that the proposed method yields superior performance over conventional fractal encoding.","authors":["Mahmoud Hassaballah","M.M. Makky","Youssef B.
