{"id":"322104267_IS_THERE_ANY_AGILITY_IN_SYSTEMS_ENGINEERING","abstract":"Industry employs agile methods more widely, mainly in software development companies. This paper tackles the point of transferring agile methods from software to systems engineering, which raises several questions: Is the transfer immediate, and if not, what are the difficulties? Does the agility refer to the product, the processes, or the project? Do systems engineering standards promote or suggest a kind of agility? Among this panel of questions, a first natural step consists of analyzing if systems engineering standards and guides already include agility in the practices they recommend and what kind of agility. The paper thus focuses on the analysis of one of the most famous current systems engineering standards, the ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 (2015), with the goal to detect any explicit or implicit reference to agility in this document.","authors":["Diego Diaz","Claude Baron","Philippe Esteban","Citlalih Yollohtli Alejandra Gutierrez Estrada"],"meta":["December 2017Insight 20(4):11-14","DOI:10.1002/inst.12173"],"references":["309450633_Innovative_agile_project_management_curriculum_for_engineering_education","304406769_Visual_backlog_in_agile_management_tools_for_rapid_software_development","298918282_Multi-Level_Agile_Project_Management_Challenges_A_Self-Organizing_Team_Perspective","287382991_Agile_The_good_the_hype_and_the_ugly","228090862_Agile_Software_Development_Ecosystem"]}
