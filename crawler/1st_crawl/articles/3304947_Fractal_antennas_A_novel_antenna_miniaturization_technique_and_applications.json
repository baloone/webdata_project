{"id":"3304947_Fractal_antennas_A_novel_antenna_miniaturization_technique_and_applications","abstract":"Fractal geometry involves a recursive generating methodology that\nresults in contours with infinitely intricate fine structures. This\ngeometry, which has been used to model complex objects found in nature\nsuch as clouds and coastlines, has space-filling properties that can be\nutilized to miniaturize antennas. These contours are able to add more\nelectrical length in less volume. In this article, we look at\nminiaturizing wire and patch antennas using fractals. Fractals are\nprofoundly intricate shapes that are easy to define. It is seen that\neven though the mathematical foundations call for an infinitely complex\nstructure, the complexity that is not discernible for the particular\napplication can be truncated. For antennas, this means that we can reap\nthe rewards of miniaturizing an antenna using fractals without paying\nthe price of having to manufacture an infinitely complex radiator. In\nfact, it is shown that the required number of generating iterations,\neach of which adds a layer of intricacy, is only a few. A primer on the\nmathematical bases of fractal geometry is also given, focusing\nespecially on the mathematical properties that apply to the analysis of\nantennas. Also presented is an application of these miniaturized\nantennas to phased arrays. It is shown how these fractal antennas can be\nused in tightly packed linear arrays, resulting in phased arrays that\ncan scan to wider angles while avoiding grating lobes","authors":["J.P.
