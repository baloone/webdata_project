Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002) is here employed to perform numerical simulation of impacts on elastic–viscoplastic solids on bidimensional non-uniform quadrilateral meshes. The formulation is second order accurate in space through flux limiters, embeds the corner transport upwind method, and uses a fractional-step method to compute the relaxation operator. Elastic–viscoplastic constitutive models falling within the framework of generalized standard materials (Halphen and Nguyen in J Mech 14:667–688, 1975) in small strains are considered. Many test cases are proposed and two particular viscoplastic constitutive models are studied, on which comparisons with finite element solutions show a very good accuracy of the finite volume solutions, both on stresses and viscoplastic strains.","authors":["Thomas Heuzé"],"meta":["December 2018Advanced Modeling and Simulation in Engineering Sciences 5(1)","DOI:10.1186/s40323-018-0101-z"],"references":["288912022_A_mathematical_representation_of_the_multiaxial_Bauschinger_effect_CEGB_Report_RDBN_731_Central_Electricity_Generating_Board_the_report_is_reproduced_as_a_paper_2007","317858629_Lax-Wendroff_and_TVD_finite_volume_methods_for_unidimensional_thermomechanical_numerical_simulations_of_impacts_on_elastic-plastic_solids","314089204_Mechanics_of_solid_materials","304347495_A_finite_difference_method_for_the_numerical_computation_of_discontinuous_solutions_of_the_equations_of_fluid_dynamics","285408331_On_the_Thermodynamics_of_Rate-Independent_Plasticity_as_an_Asymptotic_Limit_of_Viscoplasticity_for_Slow_Processes","285127304_The_propagation_of_elastic-viscoplastic_waves_in_bars","285022138_The_Propagation_of_Longitudinal_Waves_of_Plastic_Deformation_in_a_Bar_of_Material_Exhibiting_a_Strain-Rate_Effect","281102261_An_upwind_vertex_centred_Finite_Volume_solver_for_Lagrangian_solid_dynamics","278720679_Riemann_Solvers_and_Numerical_Methods_for_Fluid_Dynamics","278638241_Riemann_Solvers_and_Numerical_Methods_for_Fluid_Dynamics"]}
