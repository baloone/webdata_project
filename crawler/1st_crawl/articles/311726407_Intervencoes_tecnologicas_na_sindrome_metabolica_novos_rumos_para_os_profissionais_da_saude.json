In the prevention and management of metabolic syndrome, interdisciplinary interventions\nby health professionals have already yielded relevant results. Besides this, several technological resources now emerged as a staunch ally\nof professionals and patients in the quest for better quality of life and reduction of the adverse outcomes of this highly prevalent clinical\ncondition. Notwithstanding, the present health technology scenario takes on additional challenges in terms of interdisciplinarity, as it involves\nheterogeneous fields of knowledge (health, computer science, and communication). So, the question is: are we prepared to handle these new\nforms of health intervention?","authors":["Ana Maria Pandolfo Feoli","Maria Gottlieb"],"meta":["December 2016Scientia Medica 26(3):4"],"references":["307547793_Information_Technology_and_Lifestyle_A_Systematic_Evaluation_of_Internet_and_Mobile_Interventions_for_Improving_Diet_Physical_Activity_Obesity_Tobacco_and_Alcohol_Use","258346327_A_lifestyle_intervention_supported_by_mobile_health_technologies_to_improve_the_cardiometabolic_risk_profile_of_individuals_at_risk_for_cardiovascular_disease_and_type_2_diabetes_Study_rationale_and_p","235371977_The_Effectiveness_of_Mobile-Health_Technology-Based_Health_Behaviour_Change_or_Disease_Management_Interventions_for_Health_Care_Consumers_A_Systematic_Review","223993370_Socioeconomic_disadvantage_in_adolescent_women_and_metabolic_syndrome_in_mid-adulthood_An_examination_of_pathways_of_embodiment_in_the_Northern_Swedish_Cohort","46403207_Global_prevalence_and_trends_of_overweight_and_obesity_among_preschool_children","285363178_Effectiveness_of_an_mHealth_intervention_to_improve_the_cardiometabolic_profile_of_people_with_prehypertension_in_low-resource_urban_settings_in_Latin_America_A_randomised_controlled_trial","255176172_Using_Avatars_to_Model_Weight_Loss_Behaviors_Participant_Attitudes_and_Technology_Development","51083662_Application_of_Virtual_Reality_Methods_to_Obesity_Prevention_and_Management_Research","47348958_Prevalence_and_correlates_of_metabolic_syndrome_based_on_a_harmonious_definition_among_adults_in_the_US","6546303_Gami_AS_Witt_BJ_Howard_DE_Erwin_PJ_Gami_LA_Somers_VK_Montori_VMMetabolic_syndrome_and_the_risk_of_incident_cardiovascular_events_and_death_a_systematic_reviewand_meta-analysis_of_longitudinal_studies_"]}
