{"id":"321347561_Lose_The_Views_Limited_Angle_CT_Reconstruction_via_Implicit_Sinogram_Completion","abstract":"Computed Tomography (CT) reconstruction is a fundamental component to a wide variety of applications ranging from security, to healthcare. The classical techniques require measuring projections, called sinograms, from a full 180$^\\circ$ view of the object. This is impractical in a limited angle scenario, when the viewing angle is less than 180$^\\circ$, which can occur due to different factors including restrictions on scanning time, limited flexibility of scanner rotation, etc. The sinograms obtained as a result, cause existing techniques to produce highly artifact-laden reconstructions. In this paper, we propose to address this problem through implicit sinogram completion, on a challenging real world dataset containing scans of common checked-in luggage. We propose a system, consisting of 1D and 2D convolutional neural networks, that operates on a limited angle sinogram to directly produce the best estimate of a reconstruction. Next, we use the x-ray transform on this reconstruction to obtain a \"completed\" sinogram, as if it came from a full 180$^\\circ$ measurement. We feed this to standard analytical and iterative reconstruction techniques to obtain the final reconstruction. We show with extensive experimentation that this combined strategy outperforms many competitive baselines. We also propose a measure of confidence for the reconstruction that enables a practitioner to gauge the reliability of a prediction made by our network. We show that this measure is a strong indicator of quality as measured by the PSNR, while not requiring ground truth at test time. Finally, using a segmentation experiment, we show that our reconstruction preserves the 3D structure of objects effectively.","authors":["Rushil Anirudh","Hyojin Kim","Jayaraman J. Thiagarajan","K.
