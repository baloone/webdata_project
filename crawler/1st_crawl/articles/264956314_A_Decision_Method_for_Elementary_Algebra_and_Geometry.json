{"id":"264956314_A_Decision_Method_for_Elementary_Algebra_and_Geometry","abstract":"By a decision method for a class K of sentence (or other expressions) is meant a method by means of which, given any sentence θ, one can always decide in a finite number of steps whether θ is in K; by a decision problem for a class K we mean the problem of finding a decision method for K. A decision method must be like a recipe, which tells one what to do at each steps so that no intelligence is required to follow it; and the method can be applied by anyone so long as he is able to read and follow directions.","authors":["A.
