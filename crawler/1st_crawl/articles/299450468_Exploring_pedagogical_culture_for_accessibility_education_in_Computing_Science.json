{"id":"299450468_Exploring_pedagogical_culture_for_accessibility_education_in_Computing_Science","abstract":"This paper identifies some of the challenges of teaching and learning accessibility through the lens of pedagogy (which deals with the theory and practice of education). We argue that accessibility education in computing science presents a set of unique and challenging characteristics for those engaged in accessibility capacity building. Significant moves are being made to embed accessibility within academic curricula and professional domains. However, through a qualitative thematic review of the accessibility pedagogic literature, we find that the field lacks the pedagogic culture necessary to support widespread excellence in teaching and learning. Nonetheless, our review identifies aspects of this small but important literature that indicate how a pedagogic culture for accessibility can be stimulated through research, debate and discussion, to promote a more pedagogically-grounded approach to the field as a whole.","authors":["Sarah Lewthwaite","David Sloan"],"meta":["February 2016","DOI:10.1145/2899475.2899490","Conference: Proceedings of the International Cross-Disciplinary Conference on Web Accessibility"],"references":["283963025_A_Persona-based_Extension_for_Massive_Open_Online_Courses_in_Accessible_Design","233372962_The_state_of_the_art_of_teaching_research_methods_in_the_social_sciences_Towards_a_pedagogical_culture","228501479_HCI_education_We_are_failing-why","225765494_Radical_collegiality_Affirming_teaching_as_an_inclusive_professional_practice","225438811_Learning_about_web_accessibility_A_project_based_tool-mediated_approach","221652180_Including_accessibility_within_and_beyond_undergraduate_computing_courses","221009992_People_with_Disabilities_Materials_for_Teaching_Accessibility_and_Design_for_All","221009917_Using_Collaborative_Learning_to_Teach_WCAG_20","321512261_Those_who_Understand_Knowledge_Growth_in_Teaching","305997538_Teaching_Accessibility_Learning_Empathy","299448666_The_teaching_of_research_methods_fostering_discursive_pedagogic_spaces_in_capacity_building","295100967_'In_My_Shoes'_Interaction_Sandbox_for_a_Quest_of_Accessible_Design_Teaching_Sighted_Students_Accessible_Design_for_Blind_People","282054835_The_teaching_and_learning_of_social_research_methods_developments_in_pedagogical_knowledge","271747261_Learning_as_Researchers_and_Teachers_The_Development_of_a_Pedagogical_Culture_for_Social_Science_Research_Methods","270597123_A_pedagogical_example_of_teaching_Universal_Access","264729916_The_Tools_and_Techniques_of_Leadership_and_Management_Meeting_the_challenge_of_complexity","249634304_Transformative_Learning_as_Discourse","243769802_Those_Who_Understand_Knowledge_Growth_in_Teaching","234831324_Using_screen_readers_to_reinforce_web_accessibility_education","221652023_Accessibility_Understanding_attitudes_of_CS_students","221538890_Making_service_learning_accessible_to_computer_scientists","221010311_Teaching_Web_Accessibility_with_Contramano_and_Hera","221010212_Raising_the_Expertise_of_Web_Designers_Through_Training_-_The_Experience_of_BFWD_-_Accessible_Web_Design_Barrierefreies_Webdesign_in_Austria","221009875_Accessibility_Education_for_Web_Design_and_E-Learning_Introduction_to_the_Special_Thematic_Session","221009540_Joint_Study_Programme_on_Accessible_Web_Design","220808183_Engaging_student_programmers_as_inclusive_designers","220807207_Using_screen_readers_to_reinforce_web_accessibility_education","220696140_Design_and_the_Digital_Divide_Insights_from_40_Years_in_Computer_Support_for_Older_and_Disabled_People","45367881_The_Challenge_of_Mainstreaming_ICT_Design_for_All"]}
