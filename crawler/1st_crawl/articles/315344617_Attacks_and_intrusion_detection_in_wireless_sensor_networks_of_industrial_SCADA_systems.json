This article investigates the problems of detecting attacks in wireless sensor networks (WSN) of SCADA systems. As a result of analytical studies, the authors developed the detailed classification of external attacks and intrusion detection in sensor networks and brought a detailed description of attacking impacts on components of SCADA systems in accordance with the selected directions of attacks.","authors":["V A Kamaev","Alexey Finogeev","A A Finogeev","Danila Parygin"],"meta":["January 2017Journal of Physics Conference Series 803(1):012063","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/803/1/012063","Project: Urban Computing Laboratory"],"references":["311355379_Automatic_Information_Retrieval_and_Preprocessing_for_Energy_Management","288565179_Evaluation_of_Interaction_Level_between_Potential_Drug_and_Protein_by_Hydrogen_Bond_Energy_Calculation","278658390_Mobile_Security_Solution_for_Enterprise_Network","256941973_Ferris_wheel_A_ring_based_onion_circuit_for_hidden_services","256941968_Analyzing_well-known_countermeasures_against_distributed_denial_of_service_attacks"]}
