{"id":"234083260_On_Pairwise_Spanners","abstract":"Given an undirected $n$-node unweighted graph $G = (V, E)$, a spanner with\nstretch function $f(\\cdot)$ is a subgraph $H\\subseteq G$ such that, if two\nnodes are at distance $d$ in $G$, then they are at distance at most $f(d)$ in\n$H$. Spanners are very well studied in the literature. The typical goal is to\nconstruct the sparsest possible spanner for a given stretch function.\nIn this paper we study pairwise spanners, where we require to approximate the\n$u$-$v$ distance only for pairs $(u,v)$ in a given set $\\cP \\subseteq V\\times\nV$. Such $\\cP$-spanners were studied before [Coppersmith,Elkin'05] only in the\nspecial case that $f(\\cdot)$ is the identity function, i.e. distances between\nrelevant pairs must be preserved exactly (a.k.a. pairwise preservers).\nHere we present pairwise spanners which are at the same time sparser than the\nbest known preservers (on the same $\\cP$) and of the best known spanners (with\nthe same $f(\\cdot)$). In more detail, for arbitrary $\\cP$, we show that there\nexists a $\\mathcal{P}$-spanner of size $O(n(|\\cP|\\log n)^{1/4})$ with\n$f(d)=d+4\\log n$. Alternatively, for any $\\eps>0$, there exists a $\\cP$-spanner\nof size $O(n|\\cP|^{1/4}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\log n}{\\eps}})$ with $f(d)=(1+\\eps)d+4$. We\nalso consider the relevant special case that there is a critical set of nodes\n$S\\subseteq V$, and we wish to approximate either the distances within nodes in\n$S$ or from nodes in $S$ to any other node. We show that there exists an\n$(S\\times S)$-spanner of size $O(n\\sqrt{|S|})$ with $f(d)=d+2$, and an\n$(S\\times V)$-spanner of size $O(n\\sqrt{|S|\\log n})$ with $f(d)=d+2\\log n$. All\nthe mentioned pairwise spanners can be constructed in polynomial time.","authors":["Marek Cygan","Fabrizio Grandoni","Telikepalli Kavitha"],"meta":["January 2013","DOI:10.4230/LIPIcs.STACS.2013.209","SourcearXiv"],"references":["242506069_Faster_Algorithms_for_All-pairs_Approximate_Shortest_Paths_in_Undirected_Graphs","234810199_Additive_spanners_and_a_b-spanners","225345380_A_Simple_Linear_Time_Algorithm_for_Computing_a_2k-_1-Spanner_of_On11k_Size_in_Weighted_Graphs","245709129_Compact_Routing_Schemes_with_Minimum_Stretch","242357832_Proximity-preserving_labeling_schemes","241928380_A_Simple_Linear_Time_Algorithm_for_Computing_a_2k-1Spanner_of_On11k_Size_in_Weighted_Graphs","234802032_1_eB_-spanner_constructions_for_general_graphs","228057622_All_Pairs_Almost_Shortest_Paths","227725251_Graph_spanners","225177720_Deterministic_Constructions_of_Approximate_Distance_Oracles_and_Spanners"]}
