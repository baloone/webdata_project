{"id":"337935698_ISSN_2394-4714_Foundation_of_Computer_Science_FCS","abstract":"This paper focused on the design of Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) for extracting maximum power from solar panel to improve the efficiency of the PV system by introducing maximum power point tracking techniques. Fuzzy Logic Control (FLC) algorithm was developed using the incremental conductance technique for MPPT. The simulated results reveal that the FLC has better performance which has suppressed the oscillation around the MPP than the Perturb and Observe (P and O) controller which has much oscillation around the MPP.
