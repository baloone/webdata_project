{"id":"346886823_Multi-attention_fusion_modeling_for_sentiment_analysis_of_educational_big_data","abstract":"As an important branch of natural language processing, sentiment analysis has received increasing attention. In teaching evaluation, sentiment analysis can help educators discover the true feelings of students about the course in a timely manner and adjust the teaching plan accurately and timely to improve the quality of education and teaching. Aiming at the inefficiency and heavy workload of college curriculum evaluation methods, a Multi-Attention Fusion Modeling (Multi-AFM) is proposed, which integrates global attention and local attention through gating unit control to generate a reasonable contextual representation and achieve improved classification results. Experimental results show that the Multi-AFM model performs better than the existing methods in the application of education and other fields.","authors":["Guanlin Zhai","Yan Yang","Heng Wang","Shengdong Du"],"meta":["December 2020Big Data Mining and Analytics 3(4):311-319","DOI:10.26599/BDMA.2020.9020024"],"references":["321069982_Syntax-Directed_Attention_for_Neural_Machine_Translation","311990858_Attention-based_LSTM_for_Aspect-level_Sentiment_Classification","304789178_Context-Dependent_Word_Representation_for_Neural_Machine_Translation","284576917_Glove_Global_Vectors_for_Word_Representation","272194766_Show_Attend_and_Tell_Neural_Image_Caption_Generation_with_Visual_Attention","234057371_Translating_Learning_into_Numbers_A_Generic_Framework_for_Learning_Analytics","220916772_Sentiment_analysis_Capturing_favorability_using_natural_language_processing","13853244_Long_Short-term_Memory","343367951_Context-aware_social_media_user_sentiment_analysis","338970312_An_attention-based_neural_framework_for_uncertainty_identification_on_social_media_texts","335529527_Multi-class_sentiment_analysis_on_twitter_Classification_performance_and_challenges","334838120_Course_drop-out_prediction_on_MOOC_platform_via_clustering_and_tensor_completion","334116133_Target-Sensitive_Memory_Networks_for_Aspect_Sentiment_Classification","334115618_Transformation_Networks_for_Target-Oriented_Sentiment_Classification","334115402_Analogical_Reasoning_on_Chinese_Morphological_and_Semantic_Relations","326205451_Aspect_Sentiment_Classification_with_both_Word-level_and_Clause-level_Attention_Networks","325445601_Learning_Sentence_Representations_over_Tree_Structures_for_Target-Dependent_Classification","322588027_Recurrent_Attention_Network_on_Memory_for_Aspect_Sentiment_Analysis","319478453_Interactive_Attention_Networks_for_Aspect-Level_Sentiment_Classification","317558625_Attention_Is_All_You_Need","311990308_Attention-based_LSTM_Network_for_Cross-Lingual_Sentiment_Classification","305622270_Sentiment_Analysis_and_Opinion_Mining","288198226_Which_Contribution_Does_EDM_Provide_to_Computer-Based_Learning_Environments","281487270_A_Neural_Attention_Model_for_Abstractive_Sentence_Summarization","281145060_Effective_Approaches_to_Attention-based_Neural_Machine_Translation","280489053_Enhancing_learning_at_work_How_to_combine_theoretical_and_data-driven_approaches_and_multiple_levels_of_data","269935079_Adam_A_Method_for_Stochastic_Optimization","2518534_Thumbs_up_Sentiment_Classification_Using_Machine_Learning_Techniques"]}
