{"id":"301641082_Implicit_Coordination_Strategies_for_Effective_Team_Communication","abstract":"Objective: \nWe investigated implicit communication strategies for anticipatory information sharing during team performance of tasks with varying degrees of complexity. We compared the strategies used by teams with the highest level of performance to those used by the lowest-performing teams to evaluate the frequency and methods of communications used as a function of task structure.\n\nBackground: \nHigh-performing teams share information by anticipating the needs of their teammates rather than explicitly requesting the exchange of information. As the complexity of a task increases to involve more interdependence among teammates, the impact of coordination on team performance also increases. This observation motivated us to conduct a study of anticipatory information sharing as a function of task complexity.\n\nMethod: \nWe conducted an experiment in which 13 teams of four people performed collaborative search-and-deliver tasks with varying degrees of complexity in a simulation environment. We elaborated upon prior characterizations of communication as implicit versus explicit by dividing implicit communication into two subtypes: (a) deliberative/goal information and (b) reactive status updates. We then characterized relationships between task structure, implicit communication, and team performance.\n\nResults: \nWe found that the five teams with the fastest task completion times and lowest idle times exhibited higher rates of deliberative communication versus reactive communication during high-complexity tasks compared with the five teams with the slowest completion times and longest idle times (p = .039).\n\nConclusion: \nTeams in which members proactively communicated information about their next goal to teammates exhibited improved team performance.\n\nApplication: \nThe findings from our work can inform the design of communication strategies for team training to improve performance of complex tasks.","authors":["Abhizna Butchibabu","Christopher Sparano-Huiban","Liz Sonenberg","Julie Shah"],"meta":["April 2016Human Factors The Journal of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society 58(4)","DOI:10.1177/0018720816639712"],"references":["267393898_Coactive_Design_Designing_Support_for_Interdependence_in_Human-Robot_Teamwork","247720202_Testing_Three_Team_Training_Strategies_in_Intact_Teams_A_Meta-Analysis","246144615_Explicit_vs_Implicit_Coordination_Mechanisms_and_Task_Dependencies_One_Size_Does_Not_Fit_All","239766184_Autonomy_and_interdependence_in_human-agent-robot_teams","232479593_The_Influence_of_Shared_Mental_Models_on_Team_Process_and_Performance","222383252_Task_complexity_Definition_of_the_construct","221156015_Explanation_and_Coordination_in_Human-Agent_Teams_A_Study_in_the_BW4T_Testbed","221029931_Joint_Activity_Testbed_Blocks_World_for_Teams_BW4T","23157825_On_Teams_Teamwork_and_Team_Performance_Discoveries_and_Developments","11369022_Team_Training_in_the_Skies_Does_Crew_Resource_Management_CRM_Training_Work","8902777_Group_Performance_and_Decision_Making","5176072_The_Interdisciplinary_Study_of_Coordination","2629737_A_Knowledge-Based_Approach_for_Designing_Intelligent_Team_Training_Systems","344477388_Communication_overhead_The_hidden_cost_of_team_cognition","275453639_Assessing_Team_Situation_Awareness_in_Simulated_Military_Missions","275441505_Research_on_Employee_Recruitment_So_Many_Studies_So_Many_Remaining_Questions","270135784_Interdependence_and_Coordination_in_Organizations_A_Role-System_Analysis","254886232_Explaining_agent_behavior_in_virtual_training","248557391_The_influence_of_cue_redundancy_upon_the_human_inference_process_for_tasks_of_varying_degrees_of_predictability1","245190359_Adaptation_to_Stress_in_Team_Decision-Making_and_Coordination","232512504_Team_dimensional_training_A_strategy_for_guided_team_self-correction","232492699_Impact_of_Group_Goals_Task_Component_Complexity_Effort_and_Planning_on_Group_Performance","220457736_Adaptive_Team_Coordination","220457473_The_Impact_of_Cross-Training_and_Workload_on_Team_Functioning_A_Replication_and_Extension_of_Initial_Findings","47714490_INVESTIGATING_THE_MECHANISMS_THAT_DRIVE_IMPLICIT_COORDINATION_IN_TEAMS","47413211_An_Empirical_Analysis_of_Team_Coordination_Behaviors_and_Action_Planning_With_Application_to_Human-Robot_Teaming","11805894_The_Evolution_of_Crew_Resource_Management_Training_in_Commercial_Aviation"]}
