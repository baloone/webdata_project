{"id":"353493987_Deciding_EA-equivalence_via_invariants","abstract":"We define a family of efficiently computable invariants for ( n , m )-functions under EA-equivalence, and observe that, unlike the known invariants such as the differential spectrum, algebraic degree, and extended Walsh spectrum, in the case of quadratic APN functions over $\\mathbb {F}_{2^n}$ F 2 n with n even, these invariants take on many different values for functions belonging to distinct equivalence classes. We show how the values of these invariants can be used constructively to implement a test for EA-equivalence of functions from $\\mathbb {F}_{2}^{n}$ F 2 n to $\\mathbb {F}_{2}^{m}$ F 2 m ; to the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm for deciding EA-equivalence without resorting to testing the equivalence of associated linear codes.","authors":["Nikolay Kaleyski"],"meta":["July 2021Cryptography and Communications","DOI:10.1007/s12095-021-00513-y"],"references":["314301021_CCZ_equivalence_of_power_functions","340241912_On_the_Distance_Between_APN_Functions","313472629_Differentially_uniform_mappings_for_cryptography","302285796_On_Verification_of_Restricted_Extended_Affine_Equivalence_of_Vectorial_Boolean_Functions","265438233_APN_polynomials_and_related_codes","264243156_A_matrix_approach_for_constructing_quadratic_APN_functions","262256610_Verification_of_Restricted_EA-Equivalence_for_Vectorial_Boolean_Functions","226537778_Equivalences_of_quadratic_APN_functions","226173374_Shamir_A_Differential_Cryptanalysis_of_DES-like_Cryptosystems_Journal_of_Cryptology_41_3-72","225584745_Linear_cryptanalysis_method_for_DES_cipher_III"]}
