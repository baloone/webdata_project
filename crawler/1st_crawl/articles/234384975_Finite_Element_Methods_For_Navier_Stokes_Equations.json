{"id":"234384975_Finite_Element_Methods_For_Navier_Stokes_Equations","abstract":"The mathematical basis of FEMs for incompressible steady interior flow\nproblems is examined in a text (a revised and expanded version of the\nwork of Girault and Raviart, 1979) intended for a postgraduate course in\nnumerical analysis. Chapters are devoted to the mathematical foundation\nof the Stokes problem, results obtained with a standard FEM\napproximation, the numerical solution of the Stokes problem in primitive\nvariables, incompressible mixed FEMs for solving the Stokes problem, and\nthe theory and approximation of the Navier-Stokes problem.","authors":["Vivette Girault","Pierre-Arnaud Raviart"],"meta":["January 1986","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-61623-5","ISBN: 978-3-642-64888-5"],"references":["242921803_Analysis_of_Mixed_Methods_Using_Mesh_Dependent_Norms"]}
