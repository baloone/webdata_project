{"id":"220148239_Hyperbolicity_of_the_fixed_point_set_for_the_simple_genetic_algorithm","abstract":"We study an infinite population model for the genetic algorithm, where the iteration of the algorithm corresponds to an iteration of a map G. The map G is a composition of a selection operator and a mixing operator, where the latter models effects of both mutation and crossover. We examine the hyperbolicity of fixed points of this model. We show that for a typical mixing operator all the fixed points are hyperbolic.","authors":["Christina Hayes","Tomáš Gedeon"],"meta":["May 2010Theoretical Computer Science 411(25):2368-2383","DOI:10.1016/j.tcs.2010.02.009","SourceDBLP"],"references":["2483054_Stability_of_Vertex_Fixed_Points_and_Applications","281709434_Genetic_Algorithms_Principles_and_Perspectives_A_Guide_to_GA_Theory","274215361_Geometric_Theory_of_Dynamical_Systems_An_Introduction","267444250_The_simple_genetic_algorithm_Foundations_and_theory","246695144_Linear_Algebra_Done_Right","230675366_Derential_Topology","224043763_Differential_Topology","200026981_Topology_A_First_Course","44373761_Dynamical_Systems_stability_symbolic_dynamics_and_chaos_C_Robinson","27292238_Dynamical_System_Stability_Symbolic_Dynamics_and_Chaos","27288746_Introduction_to_the_modern_theory_of_Dynamical_Systems","12044241_A_Normed_Space_of_Genetic_Operators_with_Applications_to_Scalability_Issues","11207534_Group_Properties_of_Crossover_and_Mutation"]}
