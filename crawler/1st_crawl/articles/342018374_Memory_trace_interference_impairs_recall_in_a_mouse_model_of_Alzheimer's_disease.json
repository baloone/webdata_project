{"id":"342018374_Memory_trace_interference_impairs_recall_in_a_mouse_model_of_Alzheimer's_disease","abstract":"In Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD), hippocampus-dependent memories underlie an extensive decline. The neuronal ensemble encoding a memory, termed engram, is partially recapitulated during memory recall. Artificial activation of an engram can restore memory in a mouse model of early AD, but its fate and the factors that render the engram nonfunctional are yet to be revealed. Here, we used repeated two-photon in vivo imaging to analyze fosGFP transgenic mice (which express enhanced GFP under the Fos promoter) performing a hippocampus-dependent memory task. We found that partial reactivation of the CA1 engram during recall is preserved under AD-like conditions. However, we identified a novelty-like ensemble that interfered with the engram and thus compromised recall. Mimicking a novelty-like ensemble in healthy mice was sufficient to affect memory recall. In turn, reducing the novelty-like signal rescued the recall impairment under AD-like conditions. These findings suggest a novel mechanistic process that contributes to the deterioration of memories in AD. Mice with AD-like pathology and memory impairments surprisingly have memory engrams in their hippocampus. However, interference with novelty-like cells prevents proper recall, erroneously letting mice perceive a previously learned context as novel.","authors":["Stefanie Poll","Manuel Mittag","Fabrizio Musacchio","Lena C.
