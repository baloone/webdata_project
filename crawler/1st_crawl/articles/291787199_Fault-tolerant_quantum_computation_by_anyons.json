{"id":"291787199_Fault-tolerant_quantum_computation_by_anyons","abstract":"A two-dimensional quantum system with anyonic excitations can be considered as a quantum\ncomputer. Unitary transformations can be performed by moving the excitations around\neach other. Measurements can be performed by joining excitations in pairs and observing the\nresult of fusion. Such computation is fault-tolerant by its physical nature.","authors":["A. Yu. Kitaev"],"meta":["January 2003Annals of Physics 303(1)"],"references":[]}
