{"id":"337087956_Static_versus_dynamic_reversibility_in_CCS","abstract":"The notion of reversible computing is attracting interest because of its applications in diverse fields, in particular the study of programming abstractions for fault tolerant systems. Most computational models are not naturally reversible since computation causes loss of information, and history information must be stored to enable reversibility. In the literature, two approaches to reverse the CCS process calculus exist, differing on how history information is kept. Reversible CCS (RCCS), proposed by Danos and Krivine, exploits dedicated stacks of memories attached to each thread. CCS with Keys (CCSK), proposed by Phillips and Ulidowski, makes CCS operators static so that computation does not cause information loss. In this paper we show that RCCS and CCSK are equivalent in terms of LTS isomorphism.","authors":["Ivan Lanese","Doriana Medic","Claudio Antares Mezzina"],"meta":["April 2021Acta Informatica 58(1)","DOI:10.1007/s00236-019-00346-6"],"references":["327211329_A_Parametric_Framework_for_Reversible_Pi-Calculi","324713070_CauDEr_A_Causal-Consistent_Reversible_Debugger_for_Erlang","351321520_Event_structure_semantics_of_controlled_reversible_CCS","327146292_Event_Structure_Semantics_of_controlled_Reversible_CCS_10th_International_Conference_RC_2018_Leicester_UK_September_12-14_2018_Proceedings","308386570_Causal-consistent_rollback_in_a_tuple-based_language","304621343_A_Calculus_for_Local_Reversibility","304621295_Static_VS_Dynamic_Reversibility_in_CCS","304621294_Rigid_Families_for_the_Reversible_pi_-Calculus","287135226_Irreversibility_and_heat_generation_in_the_computing_process","284219514_Contextual_equivalences_in_configuration_structures_and_reversibility","280752222_Causal-Consistent_Reversible_Debugging","283364215_A_Reversible_Process_Calculus_and_the_Modelling_of_the_ERK_Signalling_Pathway","280789699_Flow_models_of_distributed_computations_event_structures_and_nets","280235950_Towards_Modelling_of_Local_Reversibility","278828881_Reversibility_in_the_higher-order_p-calculus"]}
