{"id":"322329108_Exponential_stability_of_general_1-D_quasilinear_systems_with_source_terms_for_the_C1_norm_under_boundary_conditions","abstract":"We address the question of the exponential stability for the $C^{1}$ norm of general 1-D quasilinear systems with source terms under boundary conditions. To reach this aim, we introduce the notion of basic $C^{1}$ Lyapunov functions, a generic kind of exponentially decreasing function whose existence ensures the exponential stability of the system for the $C^{1}$ norm. We show that the existence of a basic $C^{1}$ Lyapunov function is subject to two conditions: an interior condition, intrinsic to the system, and a condition on the boundary controls. We give explicit sufficient interior and boundary conditions such that the system is exponentially stable for the $C^{1}$ norm and we show that the interior condition is also necessary to the existence of a basic $C^{1}$ Lyapunov function. Finally, we show that the results conducted in this article are also true under the same conditions for the exponential stability in the $C^{p}$ norm, for any $p\\geq1$.","authors":["Amaury Hayat"],"meta":["January 2018"],"references":["305994875_Neumann_boundary_feedback_stabilization_for_a_nonlinear_wave_equation_A_strict_H2-Lyapunov_function","287250018_Dissipative_boundary_conditions_for_2times_2_hyperbolic_systems_of_conservation_laws_for_entropy_solutions_in_BV","260642276_Dissipative_Boundary_Conditions_For_Nonlinear_1-D_Hyperbolic_Systems_Sharp_Conditions_Through_An_Approach_Via_Time-Delay_Systems","220258823_Dissipative_Boundary_Conditions_for_One-Dimensional_Nonlinear_Hyperbolic_Systems","220258814_Gas_Flow_in_Fan-Shaped_Networks_Classical_Solutions_and_Feedback_Stabilization","220157952_Boundary_feedback_control_in_networks_of_open_channels","45866654_Exact_boundary_controllability_and_observability_for_first_order_quasilinear_hyperbolic_systems_with_a_kind_of_nonlocal_boundary_conditions","330800549_A_quadratic_Lyapunov_function_for_Saint-Venant_equations_with_arbitrary_friction_and_space-varying_slope","313504316_Stability_and_Boundary_Stabilization_of_1-D_Hyperbolic_Systems","279280926_Dissipative_Boundary_Conditions_for_One-Dimensional_Quasi-linear_Hyperbolic_Systems_Lyapunov_Stability_for_the_C1-Norm","270594585_Stability_of_linear_density-flow_hyperbolic_systems_under_PI_boundary_control","268636023_Nonlinear_Systems","267078182_One-side_exact_controllability_and_observability_for_quasilinear_hyperbolic_systems","266285270_Global_smooth_solutions_of_dissipative_boundary_value_problems_for_first_order_quasilinear_hyperbolic_systems","265449398_Ordinary_differential_equations_2nd_ed_unabridged_corrected_republication_of_the_1982_original","265370571_Boundary_Value_Problems_for_Quasilinear_Hyperbolic_Systems","260661915_Disturbance_Rejection_in_2_x_2_Linear_Hyperbolic_Systems","256227650_The_effect_of_boundary_damping_for_the_wave_equation","228635910_Control_and_Nonlinearity","220519918_Classical_solutions_and_feedback_stabilization_for_the_gas_flow_in_a_sequence_of_pipes","220519112_On_boundary_feedback_stabilization_of_non-uniform_linear_2_2_hyperbolic_systems_over_a_bounded_interval","220259275_On_the_Modelling_and_Stabilization_of_Flows_in_Networks_of_Open_Canals","43468568_The_Hydraulics_of_Open_Channel_Flow"]}
