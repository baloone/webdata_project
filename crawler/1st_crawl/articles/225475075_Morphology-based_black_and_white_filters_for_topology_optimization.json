{"id":"225475075_Morphology-based_black_and_white_filters_for_topology_optimization","abstract":"To ensure manufacturability and mesh independence in density-based topology optimization schemes, it is imperative to use\nrestriction methods. This paper introduces a new class of morphology-based restriction schemes that work as density filters;\nthat is, the physical stiffness of an element is based on a function of the design variables of the neighboring elements.\nThe new filters have the advantage that they eliminate grey scale transitions between solid and void regions. Using different\ntest examples, it is shown that the schemes, in general, provide black and white designs with minimum length-scale constraints\non either or both minimum hole sizes and minimum structural feature sizes. The new schemes are compared with methods and modified\nmethods found in the literature.","authors":["Ole Sigmund"],"meta":["April 2007Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization 33(4):401-424","DOI:10.1007/s00158-006-0087-x"],"references":["261173987_Design_of_Material_Structures_Using_Topology_Optimization","350024258_Variable-Topology_Shape_Optimization_With_a_Control_on_Perimeter","309661161_Numerical_instabilities_in_topology_optimization_A_survey_on_procedures_dealing_with_checkerboards_mesh-dependencies_and_local_minima","292102365_Digital_Image_Processing","268967189_Topology_optimization_Theory_methods_and_applications_2nd_ed_corrected_printing","261174064_On_the_Design_of_Compliant_Mechanisms_Using_Topology_Optimization","261174060_Topology_Optimization_Theory_Method_and_Applications","261173786_Optimization_of_Structural_Topology_Shape_and_Material","254223752_Application_of_Vector_Performance_Optimization_to_a_Robust_Control_Loop_Design_for_a_Fighter_Aircraft","247693707_Systematic_design_of_phononic_band_gap_materials_and_structures"]}
