{"id":"289406773_Wavelet_Scattering_on_the_Pitch_Spiral","abstract":"We present a new representation of harmonic sounds that linearizes the\ndynamics of pitch and spectral envelope, while remaining stable to deformations\nin the time-frequency plane. It is an instance of the scattering transform, a\ngeneric operator which cascades wavelet convolutions and modulus\nnonlinearities. It is derived from the pitch spiral, in that convolutions are\nsuccessively performed in time, log-frequency, and octave index. We give a\nclosed-form approximation of spiral scattering coefficients for a nonstationary\ngeneralization of the harmonic source-filter model.","authors":["Vincent Lostanlen","St√©phane Georges Mallat"],"meta":["January 2016","SourcearXiv"],"references":["236326062_Deep_Scattering_Spectrum","228630767_Improve_hidden_markov_model_partial_tracking_through_time-frequency_analysis","224163312_NMF_With_Time-Frequency_Activations_to_Model_Nonstationary_Audio_Events","51420760_Pitch_circularity_from_tones_comprising_full_harmonic_series","3077966_Asymptotic_Wavelet_and_Gabor_Analysis_Extraction_of_instantaneous_frequencies","288974413_Scattering_representation_of_modulated_sounds","286301826_Joint_Time-Frequency_Scattering_for_Audio_Classification","252671048_Pitch_Control_and_Pitch_Paradoxes_Demonstrated_with_Computer-Synthesized_Sounds","224982309_Circularity_in_Judgments_of_Relative_Pitch","8954758_Analyzing_Pitch_Chroma_and_Pitch_Height_in_the_Human_Brain"]}
