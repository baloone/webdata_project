{"id":"314295986_Understanding_Ephemeral_State_of_Relevance","abstract":"Despite its dynamic nature, relevance is often measured in a context-independent manner in information retrieval practice. We look into this discrepancy. We propose a contextual relevance/usefulness measurement called ephemeral state of relevance (ESR), which is defined as the amount of useful information a user acquired from a clicked result as assessed just after examining the result during an interactive search session. We collect ESR and context-independent usefulness judgments through a laboratory user study and compare the two. We examine factors related to both judgments and examine their differences.\nOur study demonstrates a few advantages of ESR: it captures users' real-time state of mind and perceptions; it measures how much useful information the user is able to acquire from a result rather than how much there is in the result; it better reflects users' needs and criteria of useful results during a session, highlighting novelty as a salient factor. However, we also find that users may not be able to correctly assess the credibility of information during a session, which may reduce the reliability of the collected ESR judgments.\nWe evaluate ESR, context-independent usefulness judgments, and TREC-style topical relevance judgments by correlating with user experience in a session. The results demonstrate that switching the judgment criterion from topical relevance to usefulness is fruitful, but moving from context-independent judgments to contextual ones has only limited advantages with respect to its cost and complexity. Our study enriches current understanding on the dynamics of relevance in a search session and identifies both opportunities and challenges for collecting contextual relevance judgments.","authors":["Jiepu Jiang","Daqing He","Diane Kelly","James Allan"],"meta":["March 2017","DOI:10.1145/3020165.3020176","Conference: the 2017 Conference"],"references":["291708754_Relevance_A_review_of_the_literature_and_a_framework_for_thinking_on_the_notion_in_information_science_Part_II_Nature_and_manifestations_of_relevance","266658671_Multidimensional_relevance_modeling_via_psychometrics_and_crowdsourcing","242090363_A_Model_for_Evaluation_of_Interactive_Information_Retrieval","228941293_Usefulness_as_the_criterion_for_evaluation_of_interactive_information_retrieval","226574477_Searching_for_Relevance_in_the_Relevance_of_Search","220924396_Search_behaviors_in_different_task_types","2522195_Overview_of_the_fifth_Text_REtrieval_Conference_TREC-5","311489866_What_Affects_Word_Changes_in_Query_Reformulation_During_a_Task-based_Search_Session","311488258_On_Obtaining_Effort_Based_Judgements_for_Information_Retrieval","309968101_R_package_ARM","309373403_Applied_logistic_regression_analysis_Thousand_Oaks_CA_Sage_1995","307996256_An_Analysis_of_the_Cost_and_Benefit_of_Search_Interactions","305081540_When_does_Relevance_Mean_Usefulness_and_User_Satisfaction_in_Web_Search","305081492_Evaluating_Retrieval_over_Sessions_The_TREC_Session_Track_2011-2014","301377482_Development_and_Evaluation_of_Search_Tasks_for_IIR_Experiments_using_a_Cognitive_Complexity_Framework","300031446_Salton_Award_Lecture","292669767_People_Interacting_with_Information1","288492301_Predicting_Search_Task_Difficulty_at_Different_Search_Stages","288263611_Relevance_reconsidered","281924187_Understanding_and_Predicting_Graded_Search_Satisfaction","266658688_Searching_browsing_and_clicking_in_a_search_session_changes_in_user_behavior_by_task_and_over_time","266658605_Modelling_interaction_with_economic_models_of_search","262313532_Some_comments_on_the_use_of_reliability_techniques_Letter_to_the_Editor","241770784_Personalization_of_search_results_using_interaction_behaviors_in_search_sessions","238775569_Changes_in_Relevance_Criteria_and_Problem_Stages_in_Task_Performance","235267443_Effects_of_foreign_language_and_task_scenario_on_relevance_assessment","234633418_Inside_the_Search_Process_Information_Seeking_from_the_User's_Perspective","228948292_Task_and_user_effects_on_reading_patterns_in_information_search","227608939_Relevance_judgment_What_do_information_users_consider_beyond_topicality","224071334_Applied_Logistic_Regression_Analysis","222155061_A_faceted_approach_to_conceptualizing_tasks_in_information_seeking","221520216_Beyond_DCG_User_behavior_as_a_predictor_of_a_successful_search","221301262_Personalizing_information_retrieval_for_multi-session_tasks_The_roles_of_task_stage_and_task_type","221299412_Predicting_searcher_frustration","220435589_The_concept_of_relevance_in_IR","220434765_Order_effect_in_relevance_judgment","220432920_How_users_assess_Web_pages_for_information_seeking","220432766_Use_of_relevance_criteria_across_stages_of_document_evaluation_On_the_complementarity_of_experimental_and_naturalistic_studies","51992845_Data_Analysis_Using_Regression_And_MultilevelHierarchical_Models","2913976_Relevance_The_Whole_History"]}
