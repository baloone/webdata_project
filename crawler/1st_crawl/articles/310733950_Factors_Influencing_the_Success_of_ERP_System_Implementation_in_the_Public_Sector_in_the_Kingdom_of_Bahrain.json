{"id":"310733950_Factors_Influencing_the_Success_of_ERP_System_Implementation_in_the_Public_Sector_in_the_Kingdom_of_Bahrain","abstract":"p>This study aims empirically to analyze the critical factors that impact the success of ERP system implementation in the public sector in the Kingdom of Bahrain and to clarify the benefits gained from the implementation. The study used a detailed questionnaire as a measuring instrument across the sample group to measure two main variables, the first being critical success factors (CSFs), and the second whether ERP implementation was successful or not. The CSFs are top management commitment and support, ERP system matching organization, business process re-engineering, vendor support, and training users.\nThose factors found to have a significant impact on ERP system implementation and the results illuminate the high level of success in implementing ERP systems. While simultaneously demonstrating that an organization with a functioning ERP system does not achieve the desired benefits by default, but rather the organization requires certain Critical Success Factors (CSFs) to be present and in effect for those benefits to be achieved.","authors":["Omar Mohamed Bukamal","Rami Abu wadi"],"meta":["November 2016International Journal of Economics and Finance 8(12):21","DOI:10.5539/ijef.v8n12p21"],"references":["320654373_Critical_Success_Factors_for_ERP_Systems_Implementation_in_Public_Administration","303750015_CRITICAL_SUCCESS_FACTORS_FOR_ENTERPRISE_RESOURCE_PLANNING_IMPLEMENTATION_SUCCESS","281551739_Critical_Success_Factors_in_Enterprise_Resource_Planning_ERP_System_Implementation_An_Exploratory_Study_in_Oman","274372957_A_Framework_of_ISBusiness_Alignment_Management_Practices_to_Improve_the_Design_of_IT_Governance_Architectures","271154677_Priority_of_Key_Success_Factors_KSFS_on_Enterprise_Resource_Planning_ERP_System_Implementation_Life_Cycle","265111574_KNOWLEDGE_MANAGEMENT_IN_SUCCESS_OF_ERP_SYSTEMS","260007866_Business_Information_Systems_Research_Study_and_Methodological_Proposals_for_ERP_Implementation_Process_Improvement","288254859_Multivariate_data_analysis_Prentice_Hall","269286836_A_Hybrid_Approach_to_Measure_ERP_Systems_Implementation_Using_Accountant's_Perceptions_in_Saudi_Arabia","259124188_Assessing_the_impact_of_quality_determinants_and_user_characteristics_on_successful_enterprise_resource_planning_project_implementation"]}
