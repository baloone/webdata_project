{"id":"291069751_Motivated_Numeracy_and_Enlightened_Self-Government","abstract":"Why does public conflict over societal risks persist in the face of compelling and widely accessible scientific evidence? We conducted an experiment to probe two alternative answers: the “Science Comprehension Thesis” (SCT), which identifies defects in the public’s knowledge and reasoning capacities as the source of such controversies; and the “Identity-protective Cognition Thesis” (ICT) which treats cultural conflict as disabling the faculties that members of the public use to make sense of decision-relevant science. In our experiment, we presented subjects with a difficult problem that turned on their ability to draw valid causal inferences from empirical data. As expected, subjects highest in Numeracy — a measure of the ability and disposition to make use of quantitative information — did substantially better than less numerate ones when the data were presented as results from a study of a new skin-rash treatment. Also as expected, subjects’ responses became politically polarized — and even less accurate — when the same data were presented as results from the study of a gun-control ban. But contrary to the prediction of SCT, such polarization did not abate among subjects highest in Numeracy; instead, it increased. This outcome supported ICT, which predicted that more Numerate subjects would use their quantitative-reasoning capacity selectively to conform their interpretation of the data to the result most consistent with their political outlooks. We discuss the theoretical and practical significance of these findings.","authors":["Dan Kahan","Ellen Peters","Erica Cantrell Dawson","Paul Slovic"],"meta":["January 2013SSRN Electronic Journal","DOI:10.2139/ssrn.2319992"],"references":["279680482_Ideology_Motivated_Reasoning_and_Cognitive_Reflection","263458926_Bringing_Ideology_In_The_Conservative_White_Male_Effect_on_Worry_about_Environmental_Problems_in_the_USA","258180826_Motivated_Reasoning_and_Performance_on_the_Wason_Selection_Task","251235906_Individual_Differences_in_Numeracy_and_Cognitive_Reflection_with_Implications_for_Biases_and_Fallacies_in_Probability_Judgment","250172097_Clarifying_Climate_Confusion_Addressing_Systemic_Holes_Cognitive_Gaps_and_Misconceptions_Through_Climate_Literacy","232748857_Cultural_Cognition_of_the_Risks_and_Benefits_of_Nanotechnology","230896630_Risk_As_Feelings","228770567_Science_Knowledge_and_attitudes_across_cultures_A_meta-analysis","228713010_The_impact_of_the_fall_1997_debate_about_global_warming_on_American_public_opinion","228231351_Misfearing_A_Reply","228177213_Fear_of_Democracy_A_Cultural_Evaluation_of_Sunstein_on_Risk","227542701_Culture_and_Identity-Protective_Cognition_Explaining_the_White-Male_Effect_in_Risk_Perception","226378293_Experience-Based_and_Description-Based_Perceptions_of_Long-Term_Risk_Why_Global_Warming_Does_Not_Scare_Us_Yet","225153729_Who_uses_base_rates_andPDH_An_analysis_of_individual_differences","222569551_Expressive_Behavior_in_Economics_and_Politics","222397518_Communication_and_Mental_Processes_Experimental_and_Analytic_Processing_of_Uncertain_Climate_Information","51109197_Public_Understanding_of_Climate_Change_in_the_United_States","51097609_The_Cognitive_Reflection_Test_as_a_Predictor_of_Performance_on_Heuristics-and-Biases_Tasks","50906835_Why_Do_Humans_Reason_Arguments_for_an_Argumentative_Theory","50877022_The_Role_of_Social_and_Decision_Sciences_in_Communicating_Uncertain_Climate_Risks","324348130_The_Logic_of_Collective_Action_Public_Goods_and_the_Theory_of_Groups","299063486_What's_available_Social_influences_and_behavioral_economics","287251609_What_intelligence_tests_miss_The_psychology_of_rational_thought","286274347_Hot_political_cognition_Its_self-_group_and_system-serving_purposes","285991774_The_Ambivalent_Partisan_How_Critical_Loyalty_Promotes_Democracy","284338517_Individual_risk_attitudes_Measurement_determinants_and_behavioral_consequences","284202914_Cultural_cognition_as_a_conception_of_the_cultural_theory_of_risk","278405335_The_Tragedy_of_the_Commons","275697437_Causality_Models_Reasoning_and_Inference","272930563_Risk_and_Culture_An_Essay_on_the_Selection_of_Technical_and_Environmental_Dangers","259414357_The_Cultural_Orientation_of_Mass_Opinion","259398119_Development_and_Testing_of_an_Abbreviated_Numeracy_Scale_A_Rasch_Analysis_Approach","256042997_The_Polarizing_Impact_of_Science_Literacy_and_Numeracy_on_Perceived_Climate_Change_Risks","248754757_Science_as_Subject-Matter_and_as_Method","247745052_Selective_Use_of_Heunrstic_and_Systematic_Processing_Under_Defense_Motivation","247504095_Motivated_Heuristic_and_Systematic_Processing","246914000_Myside_bias_in_thinking_about_abortion","246750592_Making_The_Most_of_Statistical_Analyses_Improving_Interpretation_and_Presentation","245316184_An_Economic_Theory_of_Voting","244062439_Cool_Dudes_The_Denial_of_Climate_Change_Among_Conservative_White_Males_in_the_United_States","243668677_The_Logic_of_Collective_Action_Public_Goods_and_The_Theory_of_Groups","237429074_Motivated_Reasoning_and_Susceptibility_to_the_Cell_A_Bias","234021438_Applied_Multiple_RegressionCorrelation_Analysis_For_The_Behavioral_Sciences","230678169_Why_we_are_poles_apart_on_climate_change","228190192_Laws_of_Fear_Beyond_the_Precautionary_Principle","228177390_Cultural_Cognition_of_Scientific_Consensus","228127914_The_Supreme_Court_2010_Term_-_Foreword_Neutral_Principles_Motivated_Cognition_and_Some_Problems_for_Constitutional_Law","227348767_Individual_Risk_Attitudes_Measurement_Determinants_And_Behavioral_Consequences","46454531_On_the_Divergent_American_Reactions_to_Terrorism_and_Climate_Change","45167835_The_Feasibility_of_Folk_Science","41029961_Who_Fears_the_HPV_Vaccine_Who_Doesn't_and_Why_An_Experimental_Study_of_the_Mechanisms_of_Cultural_Cognition","44847045_Statistical_power_ANALYSIS_for_the_Behavioral_sciences","44500847_Multiple_Imputation_For_Nonresponse_In_Surveys","42765045_The_Tragedy_of_the_Commons","41103073_Fixing_the_Communications_Failure"]}
