{"id":"343612299_Immersive_analysis_of_user_motion_in_VR_applications","abstract":"With the rise of virtual reality experiences for applications in entertainment, industry, science and medicine, the evaluation of human motion in immersive environments is becoming more important. By analysing the motion of virtual reality users, design choices and training progress in the virtual environment can be understood and improved. Since the motion is captured in a virtual environment, performing the analysis in the same environment provides a valuable context and guidance for the analysis. We have created a visual analysis system that is designed for immersive visualisation and exploration of human motion data. By combining suitable data mining algorithms with immersive visualisation techniques, we facilitate the reasoning and understanding of the underlying motion. We apply and evaluate this novel approach on a relevant VR application domain to identify and interpret motion patterns in a meaningful way.","authors":["Simon Kloiber","Volker Settgast","Christoph Schinko","Martin Weinzerl"],"meta":["October 2020The Visual Computer 36(3)","DOI:10.1007/s00371-020-01942-1","Project: VR4CPPS - Virtual Reality for Cognitive Products and Production Systems"],"references":["336663516_There_Is_No_Spoon_Evaluating_Performance_Space_Use_and_Presence_with_Expert_Domain_Users_in_Immersive_Analytics","336203177_Evaluating_an_Immersive_Space-Time_Cube_Geovisualization_for_Intuitive_Trajectory_Data_Exploration","330225055_Item_Benchmarks_for_the_System_Usability_Scale","327123581_FiberClay_Sculpting_Three_Dimensional_Trajectories_to_Reveal_Structural_Insights","324598863_Immersive_Visualization_of_Abstract_Information_An_Evaluation_on_Dimensionally-Reduced_Data_Scatterplots","322904428_Automated_CMM_inspection_planning_knowledge_capture_and_formalization","345125640_Immersive_Analytics","335508149_There_Is_No_Spoon_Evaluating_Performance_Space_Use_and_Presence_with_Expert_Domain_Users_in_Immersive_Analytics","335195769_GeoGate_Correlating_Geo-Temporal_Datasets_Using_an_Augmented_Reality_Space-Time_Cube_and_Tangible_Interactions","320313193_Investigating_the_Use_of_Spatial_Interaction_for_3D_Data_Visualization_on_Mobile_Devices","319394819_SUS_--_a_quick_and_dirty_usability_scale","318201612_Dynamic_Visual_Abstraction_of_Soccer_Movement","319483487_Algorithms_for_hierarchical_clustering_An_overview_II","319326394_Clustering_Trajectories_by_Relevant_Parts_for_Air_Traffic_Analysis","316857448_The_VR_Book_Human-Centered_Design_for_Virtual_Reality"]}
