{"id":"303462570_Experimental_Validation_of_Active_Power_Filtering_With_a_Simple_Robust_Control","abstract":"This article deals with shunt active power filtering for power quality improvement with hysteresis current controllers by two methods of implementation assessed under unfavorable non-linear load and source conditions. Fully digital and simple hybrid hysteresis control strategies are tested based on a numerical integrator proportional DC bus controller combined with phase-locked loop outputs to generate current references. In two cases, reference mains currents are generated to ensure three-phase sinusoidal synchronized waveforms of the mains currents. The experimental evaluation of the robustness control in these two implementation methods is verified using a 10-kVA shunt active power filter in steady state for transitional conditions (step load, switch-on of shunt active power filter) and in the worst case of unbalanced loads (break phase) and source voltages. Several experimental results are presented and discussed to prove the robustness and excellent performance of the proposed simple hybrid technique.","authors":["Abdelmadjid Chaoui","Jean-Paul Gaubert","Abdelouahab Bouafia"],"meta":["May 2016Electric Power Components and Systems 44(10):1-14","DOI:10.1080/15325008.2016.1148800"],"references":["275041688_A_New_Robust_Experimentally_Validated_Phase_Locked_Loop_for_Power_Electronic_Control","224588800_Tuning_of_Phase-Locked_Loops_for_Power_Converters_Under_Distorted_Utility_Conditions","224384987_Instantaneous_Reactive_Power_Theory_A_Reference_in_the_Nonlinear_Loads_Compensation","224097324_Experimental_Design_of_a_Nonlinear_Control_Technique_for_Three-Phase_Shunt_Active_Power_Filter","3353727_Control_techniques_for_active_power_filters","3217581_Review_of_active_filters_for_power_quality_improvement","3217208_Phase-locked_loop_techniques_-_A_survey","285349941_The_Instantaneous_Power_Theory","272327379_DSP_based_adaptive_hysteresis-band_current_controlled_active_filter_for_power_quality_conditioning_under_non-sinusoidal_supply_voltages","259756655_Synchronous_Detection_and_Digital_Control_of_Shunt_Active_Power_Filter_in_Power_Quality_Improvement","257788128_Electrical_Energy_Quality_Modeling_and_Hinf_Control_of_a_Three-Phase_Shunt_Active_Filter","256970677_A_comparative_study_of_harmonic_currents_extraction_by_simulation_and_implementation","245155241_A_new_compensation_algorithm_for_balanced_and_unbalanced_distribution_systems_using_generalized_instantaneous_reactive_power_theory","232623652_A_Direct_Current_Control_of_Shunt_Active_Power_Filter","229799213_The_p-q_Theory_in_Three-Phase_Systems_under_Non-Sinusoidal_Conditions","228845328_A_simple_fuzzy_logic_based_robust_active_power_filter_for_harmonic_minimization_under_random_load_variation","224696556_Adaptive_Nonlinear_Control_Applied_To_a_Three_Phase_Shunt_Active_Power_Filter","224643141_The_state-of-the-art_of_active_filters_for_power_conditioning","224393387_A_Fast_Acting_1z_Controller_for_Shunt_Active_Filter_Operation_for_Harmonics_and_Reactive_Power_Compensation","224374553_Linear_Feedback_Control_of_a_Parallel_Active_Harmonic_Conditioner_in_Power_Systems","224350041_On_the_design_of_shunt_active_filter_for_improving_power_quality","49716377_A_new_combined_method_in_active_filter_design_for_power_quality_improvement_in_power_systems","4377722_Instantaneous_Power_Theory_and_Applications_to_Power_Conditioning","3460515_A_New_Method_to_Eliminate_AC_Harmonic_Currents_by_Magnetic_Flux_Compensation-Considerations_on_Basic_Design","3407655_Harmonic_sources_and_filtering_approaches","3281577_Discussion_on_Instantaneous_-_Strategiesfor_Control_of_Active_Filters","3281216_High_Performance_Current_Controller_for_Selective_Harmonic_Compensation_in_Active_Power_Filters","3280786_Current_Control_Strategy_for_Power_Conditioners_Using_Sinusoidal_Signal_Integrators_in_Synchronous_Reference_Frame","3280003_An_Instantaneous_Active_and_Reactive_Current_Component_Method_for_Active_Filters","3275776_Current_Reference_Control_for_Shunt_Active_Power_Filters_Under_Nonsinusoidal_Voltage_Conditions","3218716_Overview_of_Control_and_Grid_Synchronization_for_Distributed_Power_Generation_Systems","3171472_Stationary_frame_harmonic_reference_generation_for_active_filter_systems","3171090_A_closed-loop_selective_harmonic_compensation_for_active_filters"]}
