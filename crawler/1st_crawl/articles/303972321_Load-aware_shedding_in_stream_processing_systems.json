{"id":"303972321_Load-aware_shedding_in_stream_processing_systems","abstract":"Load shedding is a technique employed by stream processing systems to handle unpredictable spikes in the input load whenever available computing resources are not adequately provisioned. A load shedder drops tuples to keep the input load below a critical threshold and thus avoid tuple queuing and system trashing. In this paper we propose Load-Aware Shedding (LAS), a novel load shedding solution that drops tuples with the aim of maintaining queuing times below a tunable threshold. Tuple execution durations are estimated at runtime using efficient sketch data structures. We provide a theoretical analysis proving that LAS is an (ε, δ)-approximation of the optimal online load shedder and show its performance through a practical evaluation based both on simulations and on a running prototype.","authors":["Nicolo Rivetti","Yann Busnel","Leonardo Querzoni"],"meta":["June 2016","DOI:10.1145/2933267.2933311","Conference: the 10th ACM International Conference"],"references":["266659527_Cloud-based_data_stream_processing","221310402_Staying_FIT_Efficient_Load_Shedding_Techniques_for_Distributed_Stream_Processing","221310269_Load_Shedding_in_Stream_Data_bases_A_Control-Based_Approach","220965116_Data_Triage_An_Adaptive_Architecture_for_Load_Shedding_in_TelegraphCQ","200034116_Aurora_A_New_Model_and_Architecture_for_Data_Stream_Management","259312979_On_Load_Shedding_in_Complex_Event_Processing","226972038_An_Improved_Data_Stream_Summary_The_Count-Min_Sketch_and_Its_Applications","222823543_An_improved_data_stream_summary_The_Count-Min_Sketch_and_its_applications","222457947_Universal_classes_of_hash_functions","221309997_Load_Shedding_in_a_Data_Stream_Manager"]}
