{"id":"249750890_The_Impact_of_User_Education_at_the_University_of_Botswana_Library","abstract":"Report on a study undertaken to determine the use of library resources and services by graduate students at the University of Botswana. The study collected empirical data on graduate studentsâ€™ use of resources and services. Data were gathered from 144 of 223 graduate students registered for the 1996/1997 academic year. The findings indicated that guidance in the use of library resources and services is necessary to help students meet some of their information requirements. There is a significant relationship between perceived ability to use information sources and study programme. The study concluded that to enable students make maximum use of the library resources and services, they need training on how to use them.","authors":["Babakisi Tjedombo Fidzani"],"meta":["September 1998Information Development 14(3):123-126","DOI:10.1177/0266666984239300"],"references":["347492303_Information_seeking_behaviour","272648361_Nonuse_of_an_Academic_Library","249774215_Why_User_Education_and_How_Can_Information_Technology_Help","248559318_Education_of_the_user_of_information","238436247_Educational_Research_Competencies_for_Analysis_and_Application","235272493_User_Education_in_Academic_Libraries","235271876_User_education_and_information_literacy_for_the_next_decade_An_international_perspective","234708825_A_Longitudinal_Survey_of_the_Information_Seeking_and_Use_Habits_of_Some_Engineers","234708797_Information_Seeking_Behaviour","229254020_Legislative_Information_Needs_of_Indigenous_Parliamentarians_in_Botswana_and_Impact_on_Effective_Decision_Making","37878416_Education_and_training_of_users_of_scientific_and_technical_information_UNISIST_guide_for_teachers","32961574_Library_User_Education_Examining_Its_Past_Projecting_Its_Future"]}
