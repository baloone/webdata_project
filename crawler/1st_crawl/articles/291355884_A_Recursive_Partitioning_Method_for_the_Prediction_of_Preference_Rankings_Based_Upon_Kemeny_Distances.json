{"id":"291355884_A_Recursive_Partitioning_Method_for_the_Prediction_of_Preference_Rankings_Based_Upon_Kemeny_Distances","abstract":"Preference rankings usually depend on the characteristics of both the individuals judging a set of objects and the objects being judged. This topic has been handled in the literature with log-linear representations of the generalized Bradley-Terry model and, recently, with distance-based tree models for rankings.\nA limitation of these approaches is that they only work with full rankings or with a pre-specified pattern governing the presence of ties, and/or they are based on quite strict distributional assumptions. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new prediction tree method for ranking data that is totally distribution-free. It\ncombines Kemenyâ€™s axiomatic approach to define a unique distance between rankings with the CART approach to find a stable prediction tree. Furthermore, our method is not limited by any particular design of the pattern of ties. The method is evaluated in an extensive full-factorial Monte Carlo study with a new simulation design.","authors":["Antonio D'Ambrosio","Willem Heiser"],"meta":["July 2016Psychometrika Forthcoming(3):1-21","DOI:10.1007/s11336-016-9505-1"],"references":["317339469_Analysing_partial_ranks_by_using_smoothed_paired_comparison_methods_an_investigation_of_value_orientation_in_Europe","285517097_Multidimensional_mapping_of_preference_data","283808033_Two_algorithms_for_finding_optimal_solutions_of_the_Kemeny_rank_aggregation_problem_for_full_rankings","282751998_Clustering_and_Prediction_of_Rankings_Within_a_Kemeny_Distance_Framework","327606791_Classification_And_Regression_Trees","324470397_Mathematical_Models_in_the_Social_Sciences","316540090_The_Silent_Revolution_Changing_Values_and_Political_Styles_Among_Western_Publics","313646200_Individual_differences_in_multidimensional_scaling","290897900_Latent_Class_Models_for_the_Analysis_of_Rankings","284529345_Rank_Correlation_Methods"]}
