{"id":"320711367_Genomicus_2018_Karyotype_evolutionary_trees_and_on-the-fly_synteny_computing","abstract":"Since 2010, the Genomicus web server is available online at http://genomicus.biologie.ens.fr/genomicus. This graphical browser provides access to comparative genomic analyses in four different phyla (Vertebrate, Plants, Fungi, and non vertebrate Metazoans). Users can analyse genomic information from extant species, as well as ancestral gene content and gene order for vertebrates and flowering plants, in an integrated evolutionary context. New analyses and visualization tools have recently been implemented in Genomicus Vertebrate. Karyotype structures from several genomes can now be compared along an evolutionary pathway (Multi-KaryotypeView), and synteny blocks can be computed and visualized between any two genomes (PhylDiagView).","authors":["Nga Thi Thuy Nguyen","Pierre Vincens","Hugues RoestÂ Crollius","Alexandra Louis"],"meta":["October 2017Nucleic Acids Research","DOI:10.1093/nar/gkx1003","Project: Genomicus"],"references":["318543514_High_precision_detection_of_conserved_segments_from_synteny_blocks","301792682_Ensembl_comparative_genomics_resources","295395314_Ensembl_comparative_genomics_resources","284161000_Ensembl_Genomes_2016_more_genomes_more_complexity","267931544_Genomicus_update_2015_KaryoView_and_MatrixView_provide_a_genome-wide_perspective_to_multispecies_comparative_genomics","233799045_Genomicus_Five_genome_browsers_for_comparative_genomics_in_eukaryota","224967595_A_Single_Nucleotide_Polymorphism_within_the_Novel_Sex-Linked_Testis-Specific_Retrotransposed_PGAM4_Gene_Influences_Human_Male_Fertility","23493435_EnsemblCompara_GeneTrees_Complete_Duplication-Aware_Phylogenetic_Trees_in_Vertebrates","306151993_Ensembl_Genomes_2016_more_genomes_more_complexity","48908055_Reconstruction_de_Genomes_Ancestraux_Chez_les_Vertebres"]}
