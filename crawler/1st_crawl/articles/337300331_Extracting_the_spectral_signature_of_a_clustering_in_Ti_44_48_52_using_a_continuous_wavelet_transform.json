{"id":"337300331_Extracting_the_spectral_signature_of_a_clustering_in_Ti_44_48_52_using_a_continuous_wavelet_transform","abstract":"A novel technique has been developed, making use of the continuous wavelet transform to identify α-clustered states from resonant scattering measurements in regions of high nuclear state density. This technique expedites the investigation of α clustering in medium mass and heavy nuclei where the role that α clustering plays in the structure of the nucleus is poorly understood. Here, we report the application of this technique to measurements of the He4(Ca40,44,48,α) resonant reactions, leading to an assessment of the α-cluster structure of Ti44,48,52. Clustering involving α particles was identified in Ti44 and Ti52 but was observed to break down in Ti48. The implications of these results are discussed.","authors":["Sam Bailey","Tzany Kokalova","Martin Freer","Carl Wheldon"],"meta":["November 2019","DOI:10.1103/PhysRevC.100.051302"],"references":["273332816_The_thick_target_inverse_kinematics_technique_with_a_large_acceptance_silicon_detector_array","235469643_a_cluster_states_in44_46_52_Ti","8268497_Fine_Structure_in_the_Energy_Region_of_the_Isoscalar_Giant_Quadrupole_Resonance_Characteristic_Scales_from_a_Wavelet_Analysis","7291595_Fine_Structure_of_the_Gamow-Teller_Resonance_in_Nb_90_and_Level_Density_of_1_States","285936692_Nuclear_reactions_for_astrophysics_Principles_calculation_and_applications_of_low-energy_reactions","279865147_REX_A_Monte_Carlo_simulation_of_thick_gas_target_resonant_scattering_reactions","277491314_Ne20_states_observed_via_O160O16_and_O161O16","276118246_Energy_levels_of_F_18_from_the_14_N_a_resonant_reaction","258098079_R-Matrix_Theory_of_Nuclear_Reactions","252296349_Shape_and_Compound_Elastic_Scattering_of_a_Particles_by_Ca_40_50_to_125_MeV","243478818_The_double-humped_fission_barrier","240205389_Random-matrix_physics_Spectrum_and_strength_fluctuations","232877240_The_Scattering_of_Alpha_and_Beta_Particles_by_Matter_and_the_Structure_of_the_Atom","230998883_Developments_in_the_study_of_nuclear_clustering_in_light_even_-_even_nuclei","223783519_Identification_of_quasimolecular_resonances_in_low_energy_a-40Ca_scattering_and_effects_of_compound_nucleus_excitation","223591151_Coexistence_of_cluster_structure_and_superdeformation_in_44Ti","223206813_New_candidate_for_an_alpha_cluster_condensed_state_in_16O_a_a'_at_400_MeV","221939197_Stopping_of_energetic_light_ions_in_elemental_matter","215930968_Random_Matrices_in_Physics","40829999_Nuclear_clusters_and_nuclear_molecules","13322244_Existence_of_-cluster_structure_in_Ti44_via_the_6Lid_reaction"]}
