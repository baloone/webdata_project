{"id":"303840346_A_Multi-step_Inertial_Forward--Backward_Splitting_Method_for_Non-convex_Optimization","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a multi-step inertial Forward--Backward splitting algorithm for minimizing the sum of two non-necessarily convex functions, one of which is proper lower semi-continuous while the other is differentiable with a Lipschitz continuous gradient. We first prove global convergence of the scheme with the help of the Kurdyka-{\\L}ojasiewicz property. Then, when the non-smooth part is also partly smooth relative to a smooth submanifold, we establish finite identification of the latter and provide sharp local linear convergence analysis. The proposed method is illustrated on a few problems arising from statistics and machine learning.","authors":["Jingwei Liang","Jalal Fadili","Gabriel Peyr√©"],"meta":["June 2016"],"references":["266396544_An_inertial_forward-backward_algorithm_for_the_minimization_of_the_sum_of_two_nonconvex_functions","261726149_iPiano_Inertial_Proximal_Algorithm_for_Non-Convex_Optimization","260289539_The_Lojasiewicz_inequality_for_nonsmooth_subanalytic_functions_with_applications_to_subgradient_dynamical_systems","259560171_A_Dynamical_Approach_to_an_Inertial_Forward-Backward_Algorithm_for_Convex_Minimization","243648538_Some_methods_of_speeding_up_the_convergence_of_iteration_methods","239285544_Characterizations_of_Lojasiewicz_inequalities_Subgradient_flows_talweg_convexity","235343120_Identifying_active_constraints_via_partial_smoothness_and_prox-regularity","229033529_Convergence_of_descent_methods_for_semi-algebraic_and_tame_problems_Proximal_algorithms_forward-backward_splitting_and_regularized_Gauss-Seidel_methods","228681404_The_Lojasiewicz_Inequality_for_Nonsmooth_Subanalytic_Functions_with_Applications_to_Subgradient_Dynamical_Systems","225935972_An_Inertial_Proximal_Method_for_Maximal_Monotone_Operators_via_Discretization_of_a_Nonlinear_Oscillator_with_Damping","222552722_Convergence_of_a_Splitting_Inertial_Proximal_Method_for_Monotone_Operators","220680974_Stable_recovery_of_sparse_overcomplete_representations_in_the_presence_of_noise","29623970_Alternating_Projections_on_Manifolds","29603957_Geometrical_interpretation_of_the_predictor-corrector_type_algorithms_in_structured_optimization_problems","2830004_Active_Sets_Nonsmoothness_And_Sensitivity","2354436_On_The_Minimizing_Property_Of_A_Second_Order_Dissipative_System_In_Hilbert_Spaces","2325897_Twice_Differentiable_Spectral_Functions","276459455_On_the_Convergence_of_the_Iterates_of_the_Fast_Iterative_ShrinkageThresholding_Algorithm","273471543_Activity_Identification_and_Local_Linear_Convergence_of_Forward--Backward-type_Methods","268163351_A_Gentle_Introduction_to_Optimization","267445118_An_Extrinsic_Look_at_the_Riemannian_Hessian","265434928_Tame_Topology_and_O-Minimal_Structures","264122785_Local_Linear_Convergence_of_Forward-Backward_under_Partial_Smoothness","262046890_Riemannian_Geometry_A_Modern_Introduction","260836800_An_Inertial_Forward-Backward_Algorithm_for_Monotone_Inclusions","257697367_Generalized_subdifferentials_of_the_rank_function","236736823_Variational_Analysis","220589840_Newton_methods_for_nonsmooth_convex_minimization_Connections_among_U-Lagrangian_Riemannian_Newton_and_SQP_methods","220124383_A_Fast_Iterative_Shrinkage-Thresholding_Algorithm_for_Linear_Inverse_Problems","45890930_Robust_Principal_Component_Analysis"]}
