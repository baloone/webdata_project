{"id":"226415224_A_Quantitative_Similarity_Measure_for_Maps","abstract":"In on-demand map generation, a base-map is modified to meet user requirements on scale, resolution, and other parameters.\nSince there are many ways of satisfying the requirement, we need a method of measuring the quality of the alternative maps.\nIn this paper, we introduce a uniform framework for measuring the quality of generalized maps. The proposed Map Quality measure\ntakes into account changes in all local objects (Shape Similarity), their neighborhoods (Location Similarity) and lastly across\nthe entire map (Semantic Content Similarity). These three quality aspects measure the major generalization operators of simplification,\nrelocation and selection, exaggeration and aggregation, collapse and typification. The three different aspects are combined\nusing user-specified weights. Thus, the proposed framework supports the automatic choice of best alternative map according\nto preferences of the user or application.","authors":["Richard Frank","Martin Ester"],"meta":["January 2006","DOI:10.1007/3-540-35589-8_28","In book: Progress in Spatial Data Handling (pp.435-450)","Project: Spatial Classification"],"references":["247763724_The_Application_of_Agents_in_Automated_Map_Generalisation","247676906_Supporting_multiple_representations_with_spatial_databases_views_management_and_the_concept_of_VUEL","237570679_Toward_better_support_for_spatial_decision_making_Defining_the_characteristics_of_spatial_on-line_analytical_processing_SOLAP","228606268_Multi-scale_spatial_database_design_for_online_generalisation","221111945_Recognition_of_Shapes_by_Editing_Shock_Graphs","270331523_Causes_and_Consequences_of_Map_Generalisation","267233833_Quality_Assessment_of_Generalised_Geographical_Data","240462566_Voronoi_Diagrams_-_A_survey_of_a_fundamental_data_structure","220970636_GIS_Databases_From_Multiscale_to_MultiRepresentation","220650476_Quantitative_measures_for_spatial_information_of_maps"]}
