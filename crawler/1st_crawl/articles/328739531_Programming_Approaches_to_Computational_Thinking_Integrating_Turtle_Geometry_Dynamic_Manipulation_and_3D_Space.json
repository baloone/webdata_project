However, there is still limited research that looks at coding and Computational Thinking activities through the lens of constructionism. In this paper, we discuss how the knowledge we already have from other think-ing paradigms and pedagogical theories, such as constructionism and mathematical thinking, can inform new integrated designs for the cultivation of Computational Thinking. In this context, we explore students’ engagement with MaLT (Machine Lab Turtle-sphere)1, an online environment of our design that integrates Logo textual programming with the affordances of dynamic manipulation, 3D graphics and camera navigation. We also present a study on how the integration of the above affordances can promote constructionist learning and lead to the development of CT skills along with the generation of meanings about programming concepts","authors":["Chronis Kynigos","Marianthi Grizioti"],"meta":["October 2018Informatics in Education 17(2):321-340","DOI:10.15388/infedu.2018.17","Project: Programming as an aspect of computational literacy and computational thinking: the case of designing and modding digital games"],"references":["252171902_Programming_as_a_Means_of_Expressing_and_Exploring_Ideas_Three_Case_Studies_Situated_in_a_Directive_Educational_System","250143507_Design_of_Microworlds_in_Mathematics_and_Science_Education","249134470_Development_of_Students'_Spatial_Thinking_in_a_Unit_on_Geometric_Motions_and_Area","247924673_Bringing_computational_thinking_to_K-12_what_is_Involved_and_what_is_the_role_of_the_computer_science_education_community","332085811_Computer_Science_Logo_Style_Beyond_Programming","324373353_Mindstorms_Children_Computers_and_Powerful_Ideas","280559547_To_Block_or_not_to_Block_That_is_the_Question_Students'_Perceptions_of_Blocks-based_Programming","261654624_A_Black-and-White_Box_Approach_to_User_Empowerment_With_Component_Computing","250929053_What_is_dynamic_geometry","247282509_Proofs_and_Refutations_The_Logic_of_Mathematical_Discovery"]}
