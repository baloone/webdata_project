In order to solve the problem of students e-learning on demand and the problem of teachers classroom quiz by smart mobile phone, this paper proposed a method in cloud computing environment based on open source OpenStack platform and Android. It consists of three parts which are the client part disposed on mobile used for teachers, students and the service part of classroom quiz library disposed on cloud computing platform. With the popularity of smart phones, people's learning habits are gradually changing. This paper's solution provide the functions for teachers to download classroom quiz contents, start quiz, upload scores etc, and for students to view history record of quiz and learning on demand or test themselves by cloud computing platform. By the technology of Android Wi-Fi, combined with OpenStack cloud computing platform interface API, establish an interactive Android application software tool for e-learning and classroom quiz as a SaaS service. At the same time, with the cloud storage, some teachers worked at different colleges could cooperate together to share their quiz libraries. With the OpenStack cloud computing dispatch strategy, the access cost could be reduced. The contribution of this paper is to provide the software and architecture for how to establish Android application based on OpenStack platform. Another contribution is to improve the manner for teachers and students to communicate by smart phone and enlarge the cloud computing SaaS service on demand.","authors":["Li Dan Cheng","Xiao Cheng Wang"],"meta":["October 2013","DOI:10.1109/CICEM.2013.6820225","Conference: 2013 IEEE 63rd Annual Conference International Council for Educational Media (ICEM)"],"references":[]}
