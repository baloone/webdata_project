{"id":"287498573_Student_Effort_Consistency_and_Online_Performance","abstract":"This paper examines how student effort, consistency, motivation, and marginal learning, influence student grades in an online course. We use data from eleven Microeconomics courses taught online for a total of 212 students. Our findings show that consistency, or less time variation, is a statistically significant explanatory variable, whereas effort, or total minutes spent online, is not. Other independent variables include GPA and the difference between a pre-test and a post-test. The GPA is used as a measure of motivation, and the difference between a post-test and pre-test as marginal learning. As expected, the level of motivation is found statistically significant at a 99% confidence level, and marginal learning is also significant at a 95% level.","authors":["Hilde Patron Boenheim","Salvador Lopez"],"meta":["July 2011Journal of Educators Online 8(2)","DOI:10.9743/JEO.2011.2.4"],"references":["272543481_Determinants_of_Academic_Performance_A_Multinomial_Logit_Approach","271933473_Probit_Analysis_and_Economic_Education","271688880_Effort_and_Reward_The_Assumption_That_College_Grades_are_Affected_by_Quantity_of_Study","247741788_The_Academic_Ethic_and_College_Grades_Does_Hard_Work_Help_Students_to","324308145_A_Guide_to_Econometrics","275857329_Relation_of_Study_Behaviors_and_Employment_to_Academic_Performance","271744203_Measuring_Student_Scholastic_Effort_An_Economic_Theory_of_Learning_Approach","270995799_Academic_Effort_and_College_Grades","269587849_A_Guide_to_Econometrics","249798059_Class_Attendance_in_College_A_Meta-Analytic_Review_of_the_Relationship_of_Class_Attendance_With_Grades_and_Student_Characteristics"]}
