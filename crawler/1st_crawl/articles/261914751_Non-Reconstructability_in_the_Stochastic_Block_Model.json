{"id":"261914751_Non-Reconstructability_in_the_Stochastic_Block_Model","abstract":"We consider the problem of clustering (or reconstruction) in the stochastic\nblock model, in the regime where the average degree is constant. For the case\nof two clusters with equal sizes, recent results by Mossel, Neeman and Sly, and\nby Massoulie, show that reconstructability undergoes a phase transition at the\nKesten-Stigum bound of $\\lambda_2^2 d = 1$, where $\\lambda_2$ is the second\nlargest eigenvalue of a related stochastic matrix and $d$ is the average\ndegree. In this paper, we address the general case of more than two clusters\nand/or unbalanced cluster sizes. Our main result is a sufficient condition for\nclustering to be impossible, which matches the existing result for two clusters\nof equal sizes. A key ingredient in our result is a new connection between\nnon-reconstructability and non-distinguishability of the block model from an\nErd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi model with the same average degree. We also show that it is\nsome times possible to reconstruct even when $\\lambda_2^2 d < 1$. Our results\nprovide evidence supporting a series of conjectures made by Decelle, Krzkala,\nMoore and Zdeborov\\'a regarding reconstructability and distinguishability of\nstochastic block models (but do not settle them).","authors":["Joe Neeman","Praneeth Netrapalli"],"meta":["April 2014","SourcearXiv"],"references":["258924057_Spectral_Redemption_in_Clustering_Sparse_Networks","243770190_Quadratic_Forms_in_Random_Variables","227334923_Estimation_and_Prediction_for_Stochastic_Blockmodels_for_Graphs_with_Latent_Block_Structure","221804803_Asymptotic_analysis_of_the_stochastic_block_model_for_modular_networks_and_its_algorithmic_applications","319333726_Algorithms_for_graph_partitioning_on_the_planted_partition_model","258566918_A_Proof_Of_The_Block_Model_Threshold_Conjecture","256512934_The_solution_of_some_random_NP-hard_problems_in_polynomial_expected_time","247650049_Stochastic_Blockmodels_First_Steps","221666320_Stochastic_Block_Models_and_Reconstruction","220568034_The_Metropolis_Algorithm_for_Graph_Bisection","220357548_Graph_Partitioning_via_Adaptive_Spectral_Techniques","220345201_Almost_All_Cubic_Graphs_Are_Hamiltonian","220138965_Graph_partitioning_via_adaptive_spectral_techniques","2710494_Random_Regular_Graphs_Asymptotic_Distributions_And_Contiguity","2386539_Algorithms_for_Graph_Partitioning_on_the_Planted_Partition_Model","2119457_The_phase_transition_in_inhomogeneous_random_graphs"]}
