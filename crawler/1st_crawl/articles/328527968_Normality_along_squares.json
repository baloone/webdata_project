{"id":"328527968_Normality_along_squares","abstract":"The goal of this work is to show a first example of an almost periodic zero entropy sequence (in the sense of symbolic dynamical systems) whose subsequence along squares is a normal sequence. As an application, this provides a new method to produce normal numbers in a given base.","authors":["Michael Drmota","Christian Mauduit","JoÃ«l Rivat"],"meta":["October 2018Journal of the European Mathematical Society 21(2)","DOI:10.4171/JEMS/843"],"references":[]}
