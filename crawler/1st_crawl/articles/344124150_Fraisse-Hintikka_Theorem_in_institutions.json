{"id":"344124150_Fraisse-Hintikka_Theorem_in_institutions","abstract":"We generalize the characterization of elementary equivalence by Ehrenfeucht-Fraïssé games to arbitrary institutions whose sentences are finitary. These include many-sorted first-order logic, higher-order logic with types, as well as a number of other logics arising in connection to specification languages. The gain for the classical case is that the characterization is proved directly for all signatures, including infinite ones.","authors":["Daniel Găină","Tomasz Kowalski"],"meta":["September 2020Journal of Logic and Computation","DOI:10.1093/logcom/exaa042","Project: The relationship between gaining expressive power in extending first-order logics and losing “control” over the extension"],"references":["343492312_Forcing_and_Calculi_for_Hybrid_Logics","333345941_Specification_and_Verification_of_Invariant_Properties_of_Transition_Systems","312093559_Birkhoff_style_calculi_for_hybrid_logics","276384653_Downward_Lowenheim-Skolem_Theorem_and_interpolation_in_logics_with_constructors","274151032_Quasi-varieties_and_initial_semantics_for_hybridized_institutions","263738843_Initial_semantics_in_logics_with_constructors","263735026_Constructor-Based_Inductive_Theorem_Prover","258167173_Forcing_Downward_Lowenheim-Skolem_and_Omitting_Types_Theorems_Institutionally","267125232_Distributive_normal_forms_in_the_calculus_of_predicates","265443817_Subsystems_of_Second_Order_Arithmetic"]}
