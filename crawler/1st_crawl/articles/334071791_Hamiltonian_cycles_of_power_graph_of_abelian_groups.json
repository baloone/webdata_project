{"id":"334071791_Hamiltonian_cycles_of_power_graph_of_abelian_groups","abstract":"In this article we discuss the question of existence of Hamiltonian cycles in the undirected power graph of a group, where power graph is defined as a graph with the group as the vertex set and edges between two distinct elements whenever one is a power of the other. We describe a new structural description of power graphs through vertex weighted directed graphs. We develop the theory of weighted Hamiltonian paths in a weighted graph. We solve the Hamiltonian question completely for power graphs of a class of finite abelian groups, namely \\(({\\mathbb {Z}}_p)^n \\times ({\\mathbb {Z}}_q)^m\\) where p, q are distinct primes.","authors":["Himadri Mukherjee"],"meta":["June 2019Afrika Matematika 30(3)","DOI:10.1007/s13370-019-00699-8","Project: Power Graph"],"references":["310769677_The_Power_Index_of_a_Graph","301839491_On_the_Structure_of_the_Power_Graph_and_the_Enhanced_Power_Graph_of_a_Group","268071117_On_the_Power_Graph_of_a_Finite_Group","260166157_Power_Graphs_A_Survey","257459603_Certain_properties_of_the_power_graph_associated_with_a_finite_group","235410068_Algebraic_Graph_Theory","225550021_Undirected_power_graphs_of_semigroups","222600158_Hamiltonian_cycles_and_paths_in_Cayley_graphs_and_digraphs_-_A_survey","322839543_On_the_independence_number_of_the_power_graph_of_a_finite_group","322346834_The_strong_metric_dimension_of_the_power_graph_of_a_finite_group","319395141_Graph_Theory","265210215_The_structure_and_metric_dimension_of_the_power_graph_of_a_finite_group","260812760_ON_THE_PUNCTURED_POWER_GRAPH_OF_A_FINITE_GROUP","259914992_On_power_graphs_of_finite_groups_with_forbidden_induced_subgraphs","256736521_The_Zero-Divisor_Graph_of_a_Commutative_Ring","247100686_Papers_on_Group_Theory_and_Topology_Berlin","243021493_Zero_divisor_graphs_of_semigroups","243020936_Directed_Graphs_and_Combinatorial_Properties_of_Semigroups","239284712_Coloring_of_commutative_rings","222252289_A_survey_Hamiltonian_cycles_in_Cayley_graphs","220398070_Advances_on_the_Hamiltonian_Problem_-_A_Survey","220190865_The_power_graph_of_a_finite_group_II"]}
