{"id":"242378247_Novel_Compression_of_Sparse_Bit-Strings_-_Preliminary_Report","abstract":"New methods for the compression of large sparse binary strings are presented. They are based on various new numeration systems in which the lengths of zero-block runs are represented. The basis elements of these systems, together with the non-zero blocks, are assigned Huffman codes. Experiments run on bit-maps of the Responsa Retrieval Project, and for comparison on randomly generated maps and on a digitized picture, yield compressions superior to previously known methods.","authors":["Aviezri Fraenkel","Shmuel Tomi Klein"],"meta":["January 1985","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-82456-2_12"],"references":["322941641_Systems_of_Numeration","239280153_All_about_the_Responsa_Retrieval_Project_you_always_wanted_to_know_but_were_afraid_to_ask","234830142_The_Art_of_Computer_Programming_Volume_1_Fascicle_1_MMIX_--_A_RISC_Computer_for_the_New_Millennium_Art_of_Computer_Programming","220688483_The_Art_of_Computer_Programming_Volume_I_Fundamental_Algorithms","220111454_Huffman_Coding_in_Bit-Vector_Compression","39765370_The_Art_of_Computer_Programming_vol_1_Fundamental_Algorithms","2995916_International_digit_facsimile_coding_standards","2995828_Coding_Method_For_Vector_Representation_of_Engineering_Drawings"]}
