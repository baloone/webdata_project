{"id":"220444674_An_Improved_Harmony_Search_Algorithm_with_Differential_Mutation_Operator","abstract":"Harmony Search (HS) is a recently developed stochastic algorithm which imitates the music improvisation process. In this process, the musicians improvise their instrument pitches searching for the perfect state of harmony. Practical experiences, however, suggest that the algo- rithm suffers from the problems of slow and/or premature convergence over multimodal and rough fitness landscapes. This paper presents an attempt to improve the search performance of HS by hybridizing it with Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm. The performance of the resulting hybrid algorithm has been compared with classical HS, the global best HS, and a very popular variant of DE over a test-suite of six well known benchmark functions and one interesting practical optimiza- tion problem. The comparison is based on the following performance indices - (i) accuracy of final result, (ii) computational speed, and (iii) frequency of hitting the optima.","authors":["Prithwish Chakraborty","Gourab Ghosh Roy","Swagatam Das","Dhaval Jain"],"meta":["January 2009Fundamenta Informaticae 95(4):401-426","DOI:10.3233/FI-2009-157","SourceDBLP"],"references":["284060675_Critical_values_for_the_control_parameters_of_differential_evolution_algorithms","246648860_Differential_Evolution_A_Simple_and_Efficient_Adaptive_Scheme_for_Global_Optimization_Over_Continuous_Spaces","230872679_Sequential_Quadratic_Programming","227242104_Differential_Evolution_-_A_Simple_and_Efficient_Heuristic_for_Global_Optimization_over_Continuous_Spaces","285237745_DE-a_simple_and_efficient_heuristic_for_global_optimization_over_continuous_space","280901096_Evolutionary_algorithms_for_constrained_parameter_optimization_problems","246359142_Harmony_Search_Optimization_Application_to_Pipe_Network_Design","238218319_Differential_Evolution-A_Practical_Approach_to_Global_Optimization","235890166_Music-Inspired_Harmony_Search_Algorithm_Theory_and_Applications","224982331_Harmony_a_Psychoacoustical_Approach"]}
