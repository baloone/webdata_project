{"id":"307630468_Stable_leader_election_in_population_protocols_requires_linear_time","abstract":"A population protocol stably elects a leader if, for all n, starting from an initial configuration with n agents each in an identical state, with probability 1 it reaches a configuration \\(\\mathbf {y}\\) that is correct (exactly one agent is in a special leader state \\(\\ell \\)) and stable (every configuration reachable from \\(\\mathbf {y}\\) also has a single agent in state \\(\\ell \\)). We show that any population protocol that stably elects a leader requires \\(\\varOmega (n)\\) expected “parallel time”—\\(\\varOmega (n^2)\\) expected total pairwise interactions—to reach such a stable configuration. Our result also informs the understanding of the time complexity of chemical self-organization by showing an essential difficulty in generating exact quantities of molecular species quickly.","authors":["David Doty","David Soloveichik"],"meta":["August 2018Distributed Computing 31(3):1-15","DOI:10.1007/s00446-016-0281-z"],"references":["272752430_Polylogarithmic-Time_Leader_Election_in_Population_Protocols_Using_Polylogarithmic_States","319253793_Computational_Modeling_of_Genetic_and_Biochemical_Networks","312078010_Time-Space_Trade-offs_in_Population_Protocols","310671795_Time_and_Space_Optimal_Counting_in_Population_Protocols","309574019_Timing_in_chemical_reaction_networks","304263470_Probability_1_Computation_with_Chemical_Reaction_Networks","300175420_Fast_and_Exact_Majority_in_Population_Protocols","285855378_DNA_as_a_Universal_Substrate_for_Chemical_Kinetics","281788895_Speed_Faults_in_Computation_by_Chemical_Reaction_Networks","281723583_Space-Optimal_Counting_in_Population_Protocols_Extended_Version","257204777_Programmable_chemical_controllers_made_from_DNA","272423141_Stable_Leader_Election_in_Population_Protocols_Requires_Linear_Time","268501754_Parallel_program_schemata","265470650_Space-efficient_self-stabilizing_counting_population_protocols_on_mobile_sensor_networks","262722970_Communication_with_automata"]}
