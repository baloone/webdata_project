{"id":"353971392_Extended_Text_and_Color_Based_Session_Password_Security_against_Shoulder_Surfing_and_Spyware","abstract":"Authentication is the first step in information security. It requires the user to memorize their password and remember at login time. textual passwords are the most traditional schemes that are used for providing security, but textual passwords are vulnerable to dictionary attacks, shoulder surfing, and spyware. Graphical password schemes overcome the shortcomings of textual passwords, but they were vulnerable to shoulder surfing attacks. Since conventional password schemes are vulnerable to shoulder surfing, many shoulder surfing resistant graphical password schemes have been proposed. However, as most users are more familiar with textual passwords than pure graphical passwords, text-based graphical password schemes have been proposed. Unfortunately, none of existing text-based shoulder surfing resistant graphical password schemes is both secure and efficient enough. to overcome this problem text and color are combined to generate passwords for providing higher security. a new technique called extended text and color based session password security against shoulder surfing and spyware. Session password can be used every time the password is created for authentication. In the proposed system, the user can easily and efficiently login system. Proposed scheme is resistant to shoulder surfing and accidental login and spyware.","authors":["Ms Kiran","P Lokhande","Ms Vimmi Gajbhiye","Sameer Mohammad"],"meta":["December 2014SSRN Electronic Journal 1(7):665-669"],"references":["323972948_A_New_Graphical_Password_Scheme_Resistant_to_Shoulder-Surfing","220423488_Biometric_Identification","246804231_Memory_for_Passfaces_after_a_Long_Delay","245587678_Biometrics_Getting_Back_to_Business","245331813_An_evaluation_of_the_Passface_personal_authentication_system"]}
