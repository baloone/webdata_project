{"id":"336446715_In_vivo_corneal_endothelium_imaging_using_ultrahigh_resolution_OCT","abstract":"We investigate the influence of optical coherence tomography (OCT) system resolution on high-quality in vivo en face corneal endothelial cell images of the monkey eye, to allow for quantitative analysis of cell density. We vary the lateral resolution of the ultrahigh resolution (UHR) OCT system (centered at 850 nm) by using different objectives, and the axial resolution by windowing the source spectrum. By suppressing the motion of the animal, we are able to obtain a high-quality en face corneal endothelial cell map in vivo using UHR OCT for the first time with a lateral resolution of 3.1 µm. Increasing lateral resolution did not result in a better image quality but a smaller field of view (FOV), and the axial resolution had little impact on the visualization of corneal endothelial cells. Quantitative analysis of cell density was performed on in vivo en face OCT images of corneal endothelial cells, and the results are in agreement with previously reported data. Our study may offer a practical guideline for designing OCT systems that allow for in vivo corneal endothelial cell imaging with high quality.","authors":["Xinwen Yao","Kavya Devarajan","René Marcel Werkmeister","Valentin Aranha"],"meta":["November 2019Biomedical Optics Express 10(11):5675","DOI:10.1364/BOE.10.005675"],"references":["332977999_Capabilities_of_Gabor-domain_optical_coherence_microscopy_for_the_assessment_of_corneal_disease","332436384_Live_video_rate_volumetric_OCT_imaging_of_the_retina_with_multi-MHz_A-scan_rates","331093150_Ultrahigh-resolution_anterior_segment_optical_coherence_tomography_for_analysis_of_corneal_microarchitecture_during_wound_healing","329306324_250_kHz_15_m_resolution_SD-OCT_for_in-vivo_cellular_imaging_of_the_human_cornea","324301859_Anterior_segment_optical_coherence_tomography","322376424_In_vivo_high_resolution_human_corneal_imaging_using_full-field_optical_coherence_tomography","319171880_In-vivo_imaging_of_the_palisades_of_Vogt_and_the_limbal_crypts_with_sub-micrometer_axial_resolution_optical_coherence_tomography","316260931_Review_of_adaptive_optics_OCT_AO-OCT_principles_and_applications_for_retinal_imaging_Invited","313124235_Ultrahigh-resolution_OCT_imaging_of_the_human_cornea","305369623_Evaluation_of_a_Micro-Optical_Coherence_Tomography_for_the_Corneal_Endothelium_in_an_Animal_Model","281004759_In_vivo_tear_film_thickness_measurement_and_tear_film_dynamics_visualization_using_spectral_domain_optical_coherence_tomography","277085836_Descemet_membrane_endothelial_keratoplasty","275666401_Fully_automatic_evaluation_of_the_corneal_endothelium_from_in_vivo_confocal_microscopy","263549488_Numerical_focusing_methods_for_full_field_OCT_A_comparison_based_on_a_common_signal_model","258442875_In_Vivo_Confocal_Microscopy_of_the_Ocular_Surface_From_Bench_to_Bedside","230656240_Endothelial_Cell_Loss_and_Graft_Survival_after_Descemet's_Stripping_Automated_Endothelial_Keratoplasty_and_Penetrating_Keratoplasty","8011761_A_new_system_for_the_automatic_estimation_of_endothelial_cell_density_in_donor_corneas","333882942_Descemet_Membrane_Endothelial_Keratoplasty_Versus_Descemet_Stripping_Automated_Endothelial_Keratoplasty_and_Penetrating_Keratoplasty","322904849_Phase-stable_Doppler_OCT_at_19_MHz_using_a_stretched-pulse_mode-locked_laser","312343773_Sub-micrometer_axial_resolution_OCT_for_in-vivo_imaging_of_the_cellular_structure_of_healthy_and_keratoconic_human_corneas","282046796_Keratoplasty_in_the_United_States_A_10-Year_Review_from_2005_through_2014","51423808_In_vivo_three-dimensional_confocal_laser_scanning_microscopy_of_corneal_surface_and_epithelium","21896657_Specular_Microscopy_of_Human_Corneal_Endothelium_in_VIVO","13950906_Fourier_Transform_Analysis_of_Human_Corneal_Endothelial_Specular_Photomicrographs","10764658_Corneal_thickness_and_endothelial_cell_density_measured_by_non-contact_specular_microscopy_and_pachymetry_in_Rhesus_macaques_Macaca_mulatta_with_laser-induced_ocular_hypertension","8213217_Automatic_estimation_of_endothelium_cell_density_in_donor_corneas_by_means_of_Fourier_analysis"]}
