{"id":"266658384_Bounds_for_the_query_complexity_of_approximate_equilibria","abstract":"We analyze the number of payoff queries needed to compute approximate equilibria of multi-player games. We find that query complexity is an effective tool for distinguishing the computational difficulty of alternative solution concepts, and we develop new techniques for upper- and lower bounding the query complexity. For binary-choice games, we show logarithmic upper and lower bounds on the query complexity of approximate correlated equilibrium. For well-supported approximate correlated equilibrium (a restriction where a player's behavior must always be approximately optimal, in the worst case over draws from the distribution) we show a linear lower bound, thus separating the query complexity of well supported approximate correlated equilibrium from the standard notion of approximate correlated equilibrium.\nFinally, we give a query-efficient reduction from the problem of computing an approximate well-supported Nash equilibrium to the problem of verifying a well supported Nash equilibrium, where the additional query overhead is proportional to the description length of the game. This gives a polynomial-query algorithm for computing well supported approximate Nash equilibria (and hence correlated equilibria) in concisely represented games. We identify a class of games (which includes congestion games) in which the reduction can be made not only query efficient, but also computationally efficient.","authors":["Paul Goldberg","Aaron Roth"],"meta":["June 2014","DOI:10.1145/2600057.2602845","Project: Query complexity in game theory"],"references":["269876159_Query_Complexity_of_Approximate_Equilibria_in_Anonymous_Games","256187086_Small-Support_Approximate_Correlated_Equilibria","247932412_The_Multiplicative_Weights_Update_Method_a_Meta_Algorithm_and_Applications","235633972_On_the_Communication_Complexity_of_Approximate_Nash_Equilibria","302887909_Query_Complexity_of_Approximate_Nash_Equilibria","266658391_Simple_Approximate_Equilibria_in_Large_Games","258106321_Finding_Approximate_Nash_Equilibria_of_Bimatrix_Games_via_Payoff_Queries","250379371_Learning_Regret_Minimization_and_Equilibria","237092124_Query_Complexity_of_Correlated_Equilibrium","236871805_The_Query_Complexity_of_Correlated_Equilibria"]}
