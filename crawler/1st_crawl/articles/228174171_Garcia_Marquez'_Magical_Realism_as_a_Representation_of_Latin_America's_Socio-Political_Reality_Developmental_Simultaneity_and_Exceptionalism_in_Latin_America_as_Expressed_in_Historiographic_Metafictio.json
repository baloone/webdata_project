His works are the embodiment of what he and his generation perceive to be Latin America's Socio-Political Reality; a reality characterized by developmental simultaneity and an ingrained belief in the region's exceptionalism. This paper explores how Garcia Marquez' Magical Realism, which can be labeled as historiographic metaficition, effectively represents the socio-cultural peculiarities of the region from the point of view of the common people. Garcia Marquez' works give voice to the popular belief in Latin America, that the rest of the world does not understand the region. This leads to Marquez' conclusion that Latin America must carry the burden of its solitude.","authors":["Otto von Feigenblatt"],"meta":["December 2009"],"references":["272556955_The_Task_of_the_Historian_in_el_general_en_su_laberinto","271354816_La_obra_periodistica_de_Garcia_Marquez_1954-1956","269531185_Gabriel_Garcia_Marquez","227739416_American_Orientalism_and_American_Exceptionalism_A_Critical_Rethinking_of_US_Hegemony"]}
