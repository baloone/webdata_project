{"id":"281338000_Extended-resolution_structured_illumination_imaging_of_endocytic_and_cytoskeletal_dynamics","abstract":"Super-resolution fluorescence microscopy is distinct among nanoscale imaging tools in its ability to image protein dynamics in living cells. Structured illumination microscopy (SIM) stands out in this regard because of its high speed and low illumination intensities, but typically offers only a twofold resolution gain. We extended the resolution of live-cell SIM through two approaches: ultrahigh numerical aperture SIM at 84-nanometer lateral resolution for more than 100 multicolor frames, and nonlinear SIM with patterned activation at 45- to 62-nanometer resolution for approximately 20 to 40 frames. We applied these approaches to image dynamics near the plasma membrane of spatially resolved assemblies of clathrin and caveolin, Rab5a in early endosomes, and α-actinin, often in relationship to cortical actin. In addition, we examined mitochondria, actin, and the Golgi apparatus dynamics in three dimensions.\nCopyright © 2015, American Association for the Advancement of Science.","authors":["Dong Li","Lin Shao","Bi-Chang Chen","Xi Zhang"],"meta":["August 2015Science 349(6251)","DOI:10.1126/science.aab3500","SourcePubMed"],"references":["302690273_Optical_microscopy_with_phototransformable_optical_labels","272517024_Development_of_a_Reversibly_Switchable_Fluorescent_Protein_for_Super-Resolution_Optical_Fluctuation_Imaging_SOFI","267756857_Flat_Clathrin_Lattices_stable_features_of_the_plasma_membrane","267449150_Lattice_Light_Sheet_Microscopy_Imaging_Molecules_to_Embryos_at_High_Spatiotemporal_Resolution","261068898_Large_Parallelization_of_STED_Nanoscopy_Using_Optical_Lattices","295195255_Actin_and_alpha-actinin_orchestrate_the_assembly_and_maturation_of_nascent_adhesions_in_a_myosin_II_motor_independent_manner","279896860_Endosome_fusion_in_living_cells_overexpressing_GFP-rab5","260841711_Septins_promote_F-actin_ring_formation_by_crosslinking_actin_filaments_into_curved_bundles","260446027_CRIRISPR-Cas_systems_for_editing_regulating_and_targeting_genomes","259847091_Two-Color_RESOLFT_Nanoscopy_with_Green_and_Red_Fluorescent_Photochromic_Proteins"]}
