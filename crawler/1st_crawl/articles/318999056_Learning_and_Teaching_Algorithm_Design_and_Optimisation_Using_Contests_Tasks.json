{"id":"318999056_Learning_and_Teaching_Algorithm_Design_and_Optimisation_Using_Contests_Tasks","abstract":"It is important for a future computer science engineer or scientist to master algorithm design and to know how to optimise algorithms to solve real-world problems. Most programming and IT contests require their contestants to design algorithms to solve problems and to optimise their code to get the best temporal and spatial performances. This paper presents training materials built from contest tasks to teach and learn how to design algorithms that solve concrete and contextualised problems. The first learning modules will be built thanks to a pedagogical device that will be deployed during the 2017–2018 academic year at ECAM in the frame of the LADO project. All the produced materials will be open sourced and available in English.","authors":["Sébastien Combéfis","Saïkou Ahmadou BARRY","Martin CRAPPE","Mathieu DAVID"],"meta":["July 2017OLYMPIADS IN INFORMATICS 11:19-28","DOI:10.15388/ioi.2017.02"],"references":["305084679_Learning_Programming_through_Games_and_Contests_Overview_Characterisation_and_Discussion","300228808_Pythia_Reloaded_An_Intelligent_Unit_Testing-Based_Code_Grader_for_Education","283595158_Programming_Trainings_and_Informatics_Teaching_Through_Online_Contests","251571034_Growing_Algorithmic_Thinking_Through_Interactive_Problems_to_Encourage_Learning_Programming","230822093_Teaching_Programming_and_Algorithm_Design_with_Pythia_a_Web-Based_Learning_Platform","228966581_Learning_Computer_Science_and_Engineering_in_Context","228411471_Early_introduction_of_competitive_programming","221537672_Do_we_teach_the_right_algorithm_design_techniques","220094675_Make_Learning_Fun_with_Programming_Contests","220695145_The_algorithm_design_manual"]}
