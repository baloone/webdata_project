{"id":"326258016_Configuration_based_process_and_knowledge_management_by_structuring_the_software_landscape_of_global_operating_industrial_enterprises_with_Microservices","abstract":"An increasing amount of enterprises is currently facing the topic “knowledge and process management” to be more efficient and to be able to introduce concepts of Industry 4.0. The challenge for these companies, which are mostly not Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM), but medium to large component suppliers, is that they do not have resources and expertise to establish large corporate departments that will be responsible for standardization.\nWith our concept based on Microservices (MS), we deliver a smart and straightforward system approach that can be implemented, dependent on the available resources, with little external IT support. There is no need of an organizational restructuring that goes along with major invests. Existing stand-alone tools are transferred into a common structured system.\n\nPaper is available Open Access at: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978918305304","authors":["Eike Schäffer","Hannes Leibinger","Axel Stamm","Matthias Brossog"],"meta":["January 2018Procedia Manufacturing 24(4th International Conference on System-Integrated Intelligence):86-93","DOI:10.1016/j.promfg.2018.06.013","Project: ROBOTOP"],"references":["291796521_Deciphering_the_knowledge_management_hype","345318175_Knowledge_management_barriers_An_interpretive_structural_modeling_approach","313557438_User-centered_design","260593131_Game_Theory_and_Mechanism_Design","242347488_The_silo-virus_Diagnosing_and_curing_departmental_groupthink","222297498_The_Critical_Success_Factors_for_ERP_Implementation_An_Organizational_Fit_Perspective","200827748_Enterprise_Application_Integration","200167309_The_Trouble_With_Enterprise_Software"]}
