{"id":"246375728_Higher_Order_Derivatives_and_Differential_Cryptanalysis","abstract":"High-order derivatives of multi-variable functions are studied in this paper as a natural generalization of the basic concept used in differential cryptanalysis. Possible applications of such derivatives in cryptology are discussed.","authors":["Xuejia Lai"],"meta":["January 1994","DOI:10.1007/978-1-4615-2694-0_23"],"references":["285332359_Nonlinearity_Criteria_for_Cryptographic_Functions","225159884_Markov_Ciphers_and_Differential_Cryptanalysis","221348681_Linear_Structures_in_Blockciphers","313560853_Bitwise_higher_order_differential_cryptanalysis","305117306_Differential_Cryptanalysis_of_FEAL","285332356_Differential_Cryptanalysis_of_Feal_and_N-Hash","243659151_Differential_Cryptanalysis_of_the_Data_Encryption_Standard_Springer-Verlag","225132251_Differential_Cryptanalysis_of_Snefru_Khafre_REDOC-II_LOKI_and_Lucifer","221355555_Differential_Cryptanalysis_of_DES-like_Cryptosystems","221348606_On_the_Construction_of_Highly_Nonlinear_Permutations"]}
