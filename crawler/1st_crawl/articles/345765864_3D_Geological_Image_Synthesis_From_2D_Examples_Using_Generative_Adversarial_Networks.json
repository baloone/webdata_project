{"id":"345765864_3D_Geological_Image_Synthesis_From_2D_Examples_Using_Generative_Adversarial_Networks","abstract":"Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) are becoming an alternative to Multiple-point Statistics (MPS) techniques to generate stochastic fields from training images. But a difficulty for all the training image based techniques (including GAN and MPS) is to generate 3D fields when only 2D training data sets are available. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach called Dimension Augmenter GAN (DiAGAN) enabling GANs to generate 3D fields from 2D examples. The method is simple to implement and is based on the introduction of a random cut sampling step between the generator and the discriminator of a standard GAN. Numerical experiments show that the proposed approach provides an efficient solution to this long lasting problem.","authors":["Guillaume Coiffier","Philippe Renard","Sylvain Lefebvre"],"meta":["October 2020Frontiers in Water 2","DOI:10.3389/frwa.2020.560598"],"references":["348736244_Generating_geologically_realistic_3D_reservoir_facies_models_using_deep_learning_of_sedimentary_architecture_with_generative_adversarial_networks","342423806_Inferring_3D_Shapes_from_Image_Collections_Using_Adversarial_Networks","338822837_A_Tree-Based_Direct_Sampling_Method_for_Stochastic_Surface_and_Subsurface_Hydrological_Modeling","337511742_Nested_multiresolution_hierarchical_simulated_annealing_algorithm_for_porous_media_reconstruction","329977208_Hierarchical_Optimization_Fast_and_Robust_Multiscale_Stochastic_Reconstructions_with_Rescaled_Correlation_Functions","329812270_Locality-based_3-D_multiple-point_statistics_reconstruction_using_2-D_geological_cross_sections","327099873_Accelerating_Multi-point_Statistics_Reconstruction_Method_for_Porous_Media_via_Deep_Learning","349886939_Multiple-Point_Geostatistics_Stochastic_Modeling_with_Training_Images","336009152_Gradient-based_deterministic_inversion_of_geophysical_data_with_generative_adversarial_networks_Is_it_feasible","332000558_A_Deep-Learning-Based_Geological_Parameterization_for_History_Matching_Complex_Models"]}
