{"id":"236953631_Analysis_of_Face_Recognition_Under_Varying_Facial_Expression_A_Survey","abstract":"Automatic face recognition is one of the most emphasizing dilemmas in diverse of potential relevance like in different surveillance systems, security systems, authentication or verification of individual like criminals etc. Adjoining of dynamic expression in face causes a broad range of discrepancies in recognition systems. Facial expression not only exposes the sensation or passion of any person but can also be used to judge his/her mental views and psychosomatic aspects. This paper is based on a complete survey of face recognition conducted under varying facial expressions. In order to analyze different techniques, motion-based, model-based and muscles-based approaches have been used in order to handle the facial expression and recognition catastrophe. The analysis has been completed by evaluating various existing algorithms while comparing their results in general. It also expands the scope for other researchers for answering the question of effectively dealing with such problems.","authors":["Marryam Murtaza","Muhammad Sharif","Mudassar Raza","Jamal Hussain Shah"],"meta":["September 2013International Arab Journal of Information Technology 10(4):378-388","Project: A method of expression to neutral face transformation"],"references":["286492635_Video-based_face_recognition_A_survey","243651904_The_AR_face_database","241149503_EMG_analysis_of_facial_muscles_exercise_using_oral_cavity_rehabilitative_device","235354030_Contribution_of_facial_transient_features_in_facial_expression_analysis_Classification_quantification","290729236_A_new_appearance-based_facial_expression_recognition_system_with_expression_transition_matrices","285302728_Active_and_dynamic_information_fusion_for_facial_expression_understanding_from_image_sequences","284037467_A_preliminary_note_on_pattern_recognition_of_human_emotional_expression","256309553_The_Expression_of_The_Emotions_in_Man_and_Animals","251874544_A_method_for_quantifying_facial_muscle_movements_in_the_smile_during_facial_expression_training","242632776_Recognition_of_facial_expression_from_optical_flow"]}
