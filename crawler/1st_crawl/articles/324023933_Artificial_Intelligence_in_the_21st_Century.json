{"id":"324023933_Artificial_Intelligence_in_the_21st_Century","abstract":"The field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has shown an upward trend of growth in the 21st Century (from 2000 to 2015). The evolution in AI has advanced the development of human society in our own time, with dramatic revolutions shaped by both theories and techniques. However, the multidisciplinary and fast-growing features make AI a field difficult to be well understood. In this paper, we study the evolution of AI at the beginning of the 21st Century using publication metadata extracted from 9 top-tier journals and 12 top-tier conferences of this discipline. We find that the area is in sustainable development and its impact continues to grow. From the perspective of reference behavior, the decrease in self-references indicates that AI is becoming more and more open-minded. The influential papers/researchers/institutions we identified outline landmarks in the development of this field. Last but not least, we explore the inner structure in terms of topics evolution over time. We have quantified the temporal trends at the topic level and discovered the inner connection among these topics. These findings provide deep insights into the current scientific innovations, as well as shedding light on funding policies.","authors":["Jiaying Liu","Xiangjie Kong","Feng Xia","Xiaomei Bai"],"meta":["March 2018IEEE Access PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2819688","Project: facial and social network"],"references":["320861763_Scientometric_analysis_of_scientific_publications_in_CSCW","319134622_The_Role_of_Positive_and_Negative_Citations_in_Scientific_Evaluation","318657698_From_triadic_closure_to_conference_closure_the_role_of_academic_conferences_in_promoting_scientific_collaborations","316502780_Coauthorship_network_in_transportation_research","316262886_Scientific_collaboration_patterns_vary_with_scholars'_academic_ages","313018559_Discovering_themes_and_trends_in_transportation_research_using_topic_modeling","345153150_Shifu_Deep_Learning_Based_Advisor-advisee_Relationship_Mining_in_Scholarly_Big_Data","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","314206410_HCI_down_under_reflecting_on_a_decade_of_the_OzCHI_conference","314078950_An_Observation_of_Research_Complexity_in_Top_Universities_Based_on_Research_Publications"]}
