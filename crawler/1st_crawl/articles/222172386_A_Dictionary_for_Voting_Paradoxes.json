{"id":"222172386_A_Dictionary_for_Voting_Paradoxes","abstract":"A Sonnenschein-Mantel-Debreu kind of characterization is found for positional voting procedures. Namely, for nâ©¾2 candidates, once the voting procedures and a profile are specified, the rankings of all possible subsets of candidates are uniquely determined. By varying over all profiles, one obtains a dictionary of all possible coordinated election outcomes. This is done for all positional voting procedures. As with excess demand functions, anything can happen; voting paradoxes can be very complicated. Only Borda's method avoids many paradoxes. Use of this dictionary is illustrated by significantly extending several well-known paradoxes and by obtaining new results about runoff and agenda elections, strategic behavior, etc.","authors":["Donald G Saari"],"meta":["August 1989Journal of Economic Theory 48(2):443-475","DOI:10.1016/0022-0531(89)90037-9"],"references":["4773843_The_Responsiveness_of_Approval_Voting_Comments_on_Saari_and_Van_Newenhizen","311905596_Mathematical_Economics","268781971_Fairness_and_strategy_in_voting","266983631_Social_Choice_and_Individual_Value","256416888_Inverted_orders_for_monotone_scoring_rules","247073707_Optimality_and_Informational_Eciency_in_Resource_Allocation_Processes","245640898_Chaos_and_the_Theory_of_Elections","243633616_The_Theory_of_Social_Choice","239570804_The_Choice_of_Voting_Systems","228108201_On_Informationally_Decentralized_Systems","227389030_Mathematical_Economics","226671677_Is_approval_voting_an_'unmitigated_evil'_A_response_to_Brams_Fishburn_and_Merrill","226190820_The_Borda_Dictionary","226107319_The_Problem_of_Indeterminacy_in_Approval_Multiple_and_Truncated_Voting_Systems","222755116_Monotonicity_paradoxes_in_the_theory_of_elections","222278149_Condorcet's_principle_implies_the_no_show_paradox","5202349_The_Ultimate_of_Chaos_Resulting_from_Weighted_Voting_Systems","5154866_Susceptibility_to_Manipulation","4977217_On_the_Characterization_of_Aggregate_Excess_Demand","4900645_Information_and_Performance_in_the_New2_Welfare_Economics","4894579_Market_Excess_Demand_Functions","4784083_The_Source_of_Some_Paradoxes_from_Social_Choice_and_Probability"]}
