{"id":"268557971_Plasma_Synthetic_Jet_for_Flow_Control","abstract":"The necessity of having an efficient actuator to control flow has driven ONERA to develop a pioneer actuator called Plasma Synthetic Jet (PSJ). This actuator was inspired by the John Hopkins University device. It produces a high exhaust velocity jet using electrical power. This paper presents advances in characterization of its performances by using experimental and numerical approaches with the objectives of controlling flow. Then practical application of the PSJ interaction with a main flow is shown.","authors":["Pierrick Hardy","Philippe Barricau","Daniel Caruana","Christian Gleyzes"],"meta":["June 2010","DOI:10.2514/6.2010-5103","Conference: 40th Fluid Dynamics Conference and Exhibit"],"references":["228422475_Jet_noise_reduction_by_impinging_microjets_An_aerodynamic_investigation_testing_microjet_parameters","271366722_High-Fidelity_Modeling_of_Micro-Scale_Flow-Control_Devices_with_Applications_to_the_Macro-Scale_Environment","269044135_Investigation_of_plasma-generated_jets_for_supersonic_flow_control","268564063_Experimental_Characterization_of_a_Supersonic_Flow_Control_Actuator","260584879_Sparkjet_Actuators_for_Flow_Control","260584878_Characterization_of_SparkJet_Actuators_for_Flow_Control","260584769_Computational_Assessment_of_the_SparkJet_Flow_Control_Actuator","260584666_Single-Pulse_Performance_of_the_SparkJet_Flow_Control_Actuator","260584407_Performance_Characteristics_of_the_SparkJet_Flow_Control_Actuator","231960499_The_effect_of_streamwise_vortices_on_the_aeroacoustics_of_a_Mach_09_jet"]}
