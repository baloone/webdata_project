{"id":"274012549_Linear_Codes_From_Some_2-Designs","abstract":"A classical method of constructing a linear code over $\\gf(q)$ with a\n$t$-design is to use the incidence matrix of the $t$-design as a generator\nmatrix over $\\gf(q)$ of the code. This approach has been extensively\ninvestigated in the literature. In this paper, a different method of\nconstructing linear codes using specific classes of $2$-designs is studied, and\nlinear codes with a few weights are obtained from almost difference sets,\ndifference sets, and a type of $2$-designs associated to semibent functions.\nTwo families of the codes obtained in this paper are optimal. The linear codes\npresented in this paper have applications in secret sharing and authentication\nschemes, in addition to their applications in consumer electronics,\ncommunication and data storage systems. A coding-theory approach to the\ncharacterisation of highly nonlinear Boolean functions is presented.","authors":["Cunsheng Ding"],"meta":["March 2015IEEE Transactions on Information Theory 61(6)","DOI:10.1109/TIT.2015.2420118","SourcearXiv"],"references":["235358882_Seven_Classes_of_Three-Weight_Cyclic_Codes","228720083_Boolean_Functions_for_Cryptography_and_Error_Correcting_Codes","228468692_Weight_Divisibility_of_Cyclic_Codes_Highly_Nonlinear_Functions_on_F_2m_and_Crosscorrelation_of_Maximum-Length_Sequences","220638563_How_to_Build_Robust_Shared_Control_Systems","220638300_Codes_Bent_Functions_and_Permutations_Suitable_For_DES-like_Cryptosystems","335832961_On_construction_of_semi-bent_funvtions_from_bent_functions","304425335_How_to_Build_Robust_Shared_Control_Systems","285105779_Boolean_Models_and_Methods_in_Mathematics_Computer_Science_and_Engineering","283704481_On_Semi-bent_Functions_and_Related_Plateaued_Functions_Over_the_Galois_Field_2_n_mathbbF_2n","272030337_Bent_vectorial_functions_and_linear_codes_from_o-polynomials","268167024_Codes_from_Difference_Sets","267659770_Three-weight_codes_and_association_schemes","267440426_Semi-bent_Functions_from_Oval_Polynomials","266553150_A_cyclic_code_approach_of_bent_functions_over_2_and_Z_4","266043689_Two-Weight_Codes_Punctured_from_Irreducible_Cyclic_Codes","265461895_Designs_and_Their_Codes","265448517_Some_New_Difference_Sets","263094119_Several_New_Infinite_Families_of_Bent_Functions_and_Their_Duals","263050893_Hamming_Weights_of_the_Duals_of_Cyclic_Codes_With_Two_Zeros","261470925_Weight_distribution_of_some_cyclic_codes","260302508_Further_Results_on_Niho_Bent_Functions","258239683_The_theory_of_error-correcting_codes_Parts_I_II","257340164_Further_crosscorrelation_properties_of_sequences_with_the_decimation_factor_dpn1p1-pn-12","257296568_New_constructions_of_semi-bent_functions_in_polynomial_forms","256391988_On_bent_functions","255484729_Inequivalence_of_Skew_Hadamard_Difference_Sets_and_Triple_Intersection_Numbers_Modulo_a_Prime","254057278_On_Semibent_Boolean_Functions","247891774_The_Geometry_of_Two-Weight_Codes","242371333_The_Theory_of_Error_Correcting_Codes","241689140_Weight_distributions_of_cyclic_codes_with_respect_to_pairwise_coprime_order_elements","238656246_Fundamentals_of_Error-Correcting_Codes","224243758_Semibent_Functions_From_Dillon_and_Niho_Exponents_Kloosterman_Sums_and_Dickson_Polynomials","222700575_A_family_of_skew_Hadamard_difference_sets","222407517_Skew_Hadamard_difference_sets_from_the_Ree-Tits_slice_symplectic_spreads_in_PG332h1","222360113_A_coding_theory_construction_of_new_systematic_authentication_codes","222160629_A_Proof_of_the_Welch_and_Niho_Conjectures_on_Cross-Correlations_of_Binary_m-Sequences","220776030_A_Class_of_Three-Weight_and_Four-Weight_Codes","220684548_On_the_Weight_Distributions_of_Two_Classes_of_Cyclic_Codes","220682881_Linear_Codes_From_Perfect_Nonlinear_Mappings_and_Their_Secret_Sharing_Schemes","220639262_Pseudo-Paley_graphs_and_skew_Hadamard_difference_sets_from_presemifields","220639114_Difference_Sets_and_Hyperovals","220638672_A_New_Family_of_Ternary_Sequences_with_Ideal_Two-level_Autocorrelation_Function","220638339_Geometric_and_design-theoretic_aspects_of_semibent_functions_I","220301338_A_new_class_of_monomial_bent_functions","220301162_New_cyclic_difference_sets_with_Singer_parameters","220301092_Weight_distribution_of_some_reducible_cyclic_codes","220192684_On_triple-sum-sets_and_two_or_three_weights_codes","220074811_On_Bent_Functions","48188416_Cyclotomic_Constructions_of_Skew_Hadamard_Difference_Sets","31117988_Binary_Constant_Weight_Codes_Based_on_Cyclic_Difference_Sets"]}
