{"id":"322833274_Interactive_Holographic_Display_Based_on_Finger_Gestures","abstract":"In this paper, we demonstrate an interactive, finger-sensitive system which enables an observer to intuitively handle electro-holographic images in real time. In this system, a motion sensor detects finger gestures (swiping and pinching) and translates them into the rotation and enlargement/reduction of the holographic image, respectively. By parallelising the hologram calculation using a graphics processing unit, we realised the interactive handling of the holographic image in real time. In a demonstration of the system, we used a Leap Motion sensor and a phase modulation-type spatial light modulator with 1,920 × 1,080 pixels and a pixel pitch of 8.0 µm × 8.0 µm. The constructed interactive finger-sensitive system was able to rotate a holographic image composed of 4,096 point light sources using a swiping gesture and enlarge or reduce it using a pinching gesture in real time. The average calculation speed was 27.6 ms per hologram. Finally, we extended the constructed system to a full-colour reconstruction system that generates a more realistic three-dimensional image. The extended system successfully allowed the handling of a full-colour holographic image composed of 1,709 point light sources with a calculation speed of 22.6 ms per hologram.","authors":["Shota Yamada","Takashi Kakue","Tomoyoshi Shimobaba","Tomoyoshi Ito"],"meta":["January 2018Scientific Reports 8(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-018-20454-6"],"references":["316708986_MistForm_Adaptive_Shape_Changing_Fog_Screens","282266792_Floating_autostereoscopic_3D_display_with_multidimensional_images_for_telesurgical_visualization","318612581_Holographic_near-eye_displays_for_virtual_and_augmented_reality","317096570_3D_Interactive_Surgical_Visualization_System_using_Mobile_Spatial_Information_Acquisition_and_Autostereoscopic_Display","315972950_High_resolution_real-time_projection_display_using_a_half-overlap-pixel_method","312871667_Full-Parallax_Holographic_Light-Field_3-D_Displays_and_Interactive_3-D_Touch","312265061_Fast_generation_of_computer-generated_holograms_using_wavelet_shrinkage","310822262_Light-field_and_holographic_three-dimensional_displays_Invited","310621547_360-Degree_tabletop_electronic_holographic_display","298731682_Fast_method_of_calculating_a_photorealistic_hologram_based_on_orthographic_ray-wavefront_conversion","279988757_Aerial_projection_of_three-dimensional_motion_pictures_by_electro-holography_and_parabolic_mirrors","275046341_Exploring_Direct_3D_Interaction_for_Full_Horizontal_Parallax_Light_Field_Displays_Using_Leap_Motion_Controller","272340695_Design_Implementation_and_Characterization_of_a_Quantum-Dot-Based_Volumetric_Display","267815782_Real-time_spatiotemporal_division_multiplexing_electroholography_with_a_single_graphics_processing_unit_utilizing_movie_features","267400420_Floating_aerial_LED_signage_based_on_aerial_imaging_by_retro-reflection_AIRR"]}
