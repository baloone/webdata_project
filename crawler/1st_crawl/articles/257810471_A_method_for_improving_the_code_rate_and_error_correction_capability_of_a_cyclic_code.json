{"id":"257810471_A_method_for_improving_the_code_rate_and_error_correction_capability_of_a_cyclic_code","abstract":"Currently, there has been an increasing demand for operational and trustworthy digital data transmission and storage systems. This demand has been augmented by the appearance of large-scale, high-speed data networks for the exchange, processing and storage of digital information in the different spheres. In this paper, we explore a way to achieve this goal. For given positive integers \n\n$n,r$\n, we establish that corresponding to a binary cyclic code \n\n$C_0[n,n-r]$\n, there is a binary cyclic code \n\n$C[(n+1)^{3^{k}}-1,(n+1)^{3^{k}}-1-3^{k}r]$\n, where \n\n$k$\nis a nonnegative integer, which plays a role in enhancing code rate and error correction capability. In the given scheme, the new code \n\n$C$\nis in fact responsible to carry data transmitted by \n\n$C_{0}$\n. Consequently, a codeword of the code \n\n$C_{0}$\ncan be encoded by the generator matrix of \n\n$C$\nand therefore this arrangement for transferring data offers a safe and swift mode.","authors":["Tariq Shah","Amanullah Phulpoto","Antonio Andrade"],"meta":["July 2013Computational and Applied Mathematics 32(2)","DOI:10.1007/s40314-013-0010-1"],"references":["262480615_Encoding_through_generalized_polynomial_codes","260165888_Error-correcting_codes_as_ideals_in_group_rings","228742028_On_finite_principal_ideal_rings","226556503_Generators_and_weights_of_polynomial_codes","314734329_Linear_Codes_over_Finite_Local_Rings_in_a_Chain","265817697_Topics_in_applied_abstract_algebra","260166037_Ring_constructions_and_applications","257312876_Constructions_of_codes_through_the_semigroup_ring_BX122Z0_and_encoding","242369129_Linear_Codes_over_Finite_Rings1","225115238_An_Algorithm_for_Computing_the_Minimum_Distances_of_Extensions_of_BCH_Codes_Embedded_in_Semigroup_Rings"]}
