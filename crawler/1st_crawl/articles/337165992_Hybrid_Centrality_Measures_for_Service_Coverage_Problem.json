{"id":"337165992_Hybrid_Centrality_Measures_for_Service_Coverage_Problem","abstract":"Service Coverage Problem aims to find an ideal node for installing a service station in a given network such that services requested from various nodes are satisfied while minimizing the response time. Centrality Measures have been proved to be a salient computational science tool to find important nodes in networks. With increasing complexity and vividness in the network analysis problems, there is a need to modify the existing traditional centrality measures. In this paper we propose a new way of hybridizing centrality measures based on node-weighted centrality measures to address the service coverage problem.","authors":["Anuj Singh","Rishi Ranjan Singh","S.
