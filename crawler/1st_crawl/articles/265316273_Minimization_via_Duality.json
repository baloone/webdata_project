{"id":"265316273_Minimization_via_Duality","abstract":"We show how to use duality theory to construct minimized versions of a wide class of automata. We work out three cases in detail: (a variant of) ordinary automata, weighted automata and probabilistic automata. The basic idea is that instead of constructing a maximal quotient we go to the dual and look for a minimal subalgebra and then return to the original category. Duality ensures that the minimal subobject becomes the maximally quotiented object.","authors":["Nick Bezhanishvili","Clemens Kupke","Prakash Panangaden"],"meta":["September 2012","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-32621-9_14","Conference: International Workshop on Logic, Language, Information, and Computation"],"references":["254890553_Brzozowski's_Algorithm_CoAlgebraically","221605366_Representing_Systems_with_Hidden_State","220370235_Labelled_Markov_Processes_Stronger_and_Faster_Approximations","2613854_Learning_Functions_Represented_as_Multiplicity_Automata","267139632_Introduction_to_Boolean_Algebras","262158696_A_Coalgebraic_Perspective_on_Minimization_and_Determinization","248856425_The_Optimal_Control_of_Partially_Observable_Markov_Processes_Over_a_Finite_Horizon","245976465_Duality_in_analysis_from_the_point_of_view_of_triples","239041872_Canonical_regular_expressions_and_minimal_state_graphs_for_definite_events","235207751_The_Optimal_Control_of_Partially_Observable_Markov_Processes","222632219_Adjoint_machines_state-behavior_machines_and_duality","222494606_Planning_and_Acting_in_Partially_Observable_Stochastic_Domains","220694920_Labelled_Markov_Processes","220689148_Abstract_and_Concrete_Categories_-_The_Joy_of_Cats","50387705_A_Coalgebraic_Perspective_on_Linear_Weighted_Automata","7192579_A_general_theory_of_Spectra_II","7192500_A_general_theory_of_Spectra_I"]}
