{"id":"301417718_Diffusion_Maximization_in_Evolving_Social_Networks","abstract":"Diffusion in social networks has been studied extensively in the past few years. Most previous work assumes that the underlying network is a static object that remains unchanged as the diffusion process progresses. However, there are several real-life networks that change dynamically over time. In this paper, we study diffusion on such evolving networks and extend the popular Independent Cascade and Linear Threshold models to account for network evolution. In particular, we introduce two natural variations, a persistent and a transient one, to capture diffusions of different types. We consider the problem of influence maximization where the goal is to select a few influential nodes to initiate a diffusion with maximum spread. We show that, surprisingly, when considering evolving networks the diffusion function is no longer submodular for the transient models, and not even monotone for the transient Independent Cascade model. We also show that, depending on the model, delaying the activation of the initiators may improve diffusion. Our experiments, using three real datasets, demonstrate the effect of network evolution on the diffusion process, and highlight the importance of timing in the selection process.","authors":["Nathalie Gayraud","Evaggelia Pitoura","Panayiotis Tsaparas"],"meta":["November 2015","DOI:10.1145/2817946.2817965","Conference: the 2015 ACM"],"references":["274927934_DynaDiffuse_A_Dynamic_Diffusion_Model_for_Continuous_Time_Constrained_Influence_Maximization","265127977_Sketch-based_Influence_Maximization_and_Computation_Scaling_up_with_Guarantees","258520507_Scalable_Influence_Estimation_in_Continuous-Time_Diffusion_Networks","256614442_Estimating_Potential_Infection_Transmission_Routes_in_Hospital_Wards_Using_Wearable_Proximity_Sensors","242914003_An_Analysis_of_Approximations_for_Maximizing_Submodular_Set_Functions-I","226804694_Talk_of_the_Network_A_Complex_Systems_Look_at_the_Underlying_Process_of_Word-of-Mouth","221654678_Cost-effective_outbreak_detection_in_networks","221653723_Scalable_Influence_Maximization_for_Prevalent_Viral_Marketing_in_Large-Scale_Social_Networks","221465293_Diffusion_in_Dynamic_Social_Networks_Application_in_Epidemiology","51968159_Characterizing_Continuous_Time_Random_Walks_on_Time_Varying_Graphs","51890216_Uncovering_the_Temporal_Dynamics_of_Diffusion_Networks","2477877_Maximizing_the_Spread_of_Influence_through_a_Social_Network","308308434_Submodular_function_maximization_Tractability_Pract","289829343_On_Influential_Node_Discovery_in_Dynamic_Social_Networks","271556312_Influence_Maximization_in_Dynamic_Social_Networks","262389820_A_Matter_of_Time_-_Intrinsic_or_Extrinsic_-_for_Diffusion_in_Evolving_Complex_Networks","261040846_Time_Constrained_Influence_Maximization_in_Social_Networks","250428492_Laws_of_Graph_Evolution_Densiflcation_and_Shrinking_Diameters","236024942_Sensing_the_'Health_State'of_a_Community","225246148_An_analysis_of_approximations_for_maximizing_submodular_set_functions-II","224919731_Influence_Maximization_in_Continuous_Time_Diffusion_Networks","224014491_Time-Critical_Influence_Maximization_in_Social_Networks_withTime-Delayed_Diffusion_Process","221654258_Friendship_and_Mobility_User_Movement_In_Location-Based_Social_Networks","220765127_Scalable_Influence_Maximization_in_Social_Networks_under_the_Linear_Threshold_Model","220699354_Virus_Propagation_on_Time-Varying_Networks_Theory_and_Immunization_Algorithms","220693394_Networks_Crowds_and_Markets_Reasoning_About_A_Highly_Connected_World","2379126_Mining_the_Network_Value_of_Customers","2175488_Graph_Evolution_Densification_and_Shrinking_Diameters"]}
