{"id":"221213205_R_Trees_A_Dynamic_Index_Structure_for_Spatial_Searching","abstract":"In order to handle spatial data efficiently, as required in computer aided design and geo-data applications, a database system needs an index mechanism that will help it retrieve data items quickly according to their spatial locations However, traditional indexing methods are not well suited to data objects of non-zero size located m multi-dimensional spaces In this paper we describe a dynamic index structure called an R-tree which meets this need, and give algorithms for searching and updating it. We present the results of a series of tests which indicate that the structure performs well, and conclude that it is useful for current database systems in spatial applications","authors":["Antonin Guttman"],"meta":["January 1984","DOI:10.1145/971697.602266","SourceDBLP","Conference: SIGMOD'84, Proceedings of Annual Meeting, Boston, Massachusetts, June 18-21, 1984"],"references":["220566048_Data_Structures_for_Range_Searching","292067194_RISC_II_MICRO-ARCHITECTURE","242463515_Organization_and_maintenance_of_large_ordered_indices","238727548_The_complexity_of_fixed-radius_near_neighbor_searching","235169202_The_Grid_File_A_Data_Structure_Designed_to_Support_Proximity_Queries_on_Spatial_Objects","235045618_INGRES_-_A_Relational_Data_Base_System","234807482_Ubiquitous_B-Tree","221214204_Application_of_Abstract_Data_Types_and_Abstract_Indices_to_CAD_Data_Bases","220565839_The_Ubiquitous_B-Tree","220424200_Multidimensional_Binary_Search_Trees_Used_for_Associative_Searching_Communications_of_the_ACM_189_509-517","220225062_System_R_Relational_Approach_to_Database_Management","220197855_Quad_Trees_A_Data_Structure_for_Retrieval_on_Composite_Keys","220282510_Using_a_Relational_Database_Management_System_for_Computer_Aided_Design_Data","220225230_Interval_Hierarchies_and_Their_Application_to_Predicate_Files","220114426_Finding_Near_Neighbors_in_K-Dimensional_Space"]}
