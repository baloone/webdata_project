These methods allow to create an innovative approach to solving research tasks that are the basis for the development of key competencies of the future teacher of computer science. The article provides an example of building a model of “predator”-“prey”, which includes: a general description of the model, stating the problem, compilation of a mathematical model for dealing with the task, transferring a mathematical model into a computer one. Modeling in the field of dealing with applied tasks is actively used while teaching students at Lipetsk State Pedagogical University named after P.P. Semenov-Tyan-Shanskiy.","authors":["Z.A.
