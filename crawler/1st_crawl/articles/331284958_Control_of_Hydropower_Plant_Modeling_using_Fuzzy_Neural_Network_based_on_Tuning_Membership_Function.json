Firstly, they decomposed the annual input variables like the net head of the turbine, and flow rate of water into a certain number of detail signals through artificial neural network (ANN) transform. ANN model used to predict the annual power generation. After the stationary simulation prediction model is obtained, the prediction resuts were superposed. The superposed prediction results are corrected by using tuning fuzzy artificial neural network (TFANN). The control method hasnâ€™t had a good robustness, which could resist the random disturbances. Finally, simulation results have demonstrated the robustness and effectiveness of this new approach when compared with the existing one.","authors":["Ali Thaeer Hammid","Mohd Herwan Sulaiman","Tamara A.
