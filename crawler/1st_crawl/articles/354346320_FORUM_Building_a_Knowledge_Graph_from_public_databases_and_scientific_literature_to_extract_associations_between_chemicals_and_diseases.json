{"id":"354346320_FORUM_Building_a_Knowledge_Graph_from_public_databases_and_scientific_literature_to_extract_associations_between_chemicals_and_diseases","abstract":"Motivation\nMetabolomics studies aim at reporting a metabolic signature (list of metabolites) related to a particular experimental condition. These signatures are instrumental in the identification of biomarkers or classification of individuals, however their biological and physiological interpretation remains a challenge. To support this task, we introduce FORUM: a Knowledge Graph (KG) providing a semantic representation of relations between chemicals and biomedical concepts, built from a federation of life science databases and scientific literature repositories.\n\nResults\nThe use of a Semantic Web framework on biological data allows us to apply ontological based reasoning to infer new relations between entities. We show that these new relations provide different levels of abstraction and could open the path to new hypotheses. We estimate the statistical relevance of each extracted relation, explicit or inferred, using an enrichment analysis, and instantiate them as new knowledge in the KG to support results interpretation/further inquiries.\n\nAvailability\nA web interface to browse and download the extracted relations, as well as a SPARQL endpoint to directly probe the whole FORUM knowledge graph, are available at https://forum-webapp.semantic-metabolomics.fr. The code needed to reproduce the triplestore is available at https://github.com/eMetaboHUB/Forum-DiseasesChem.\n\nSupplementary information\nSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","authors":["Maxime Delmas","Olivier Filangi","Nils Paulhe","Florence Vinson"],"meta":["September 2021Bioinformatics 37(21)","DOI:10.1093/bioinformatics/btab627"],"references":["350300327_KnetMiner_a_comprehensive_approach_for_supporting_evidence-based_gene_discovery_and_complex_trait_analysis_across_species","341467390_Extending_the_small-molecule_similarity_principle_to_all_levels_of_biology_with_the_Chemical_Checker","332510524_Drug_prioritization_using_the_semantic_properties_of_a_knowledge_graph","331874525_A_new_wave_of_innovation_in_Semantic_web_tools_for_drug_discovery","330906372_The_Possibility_of_Systematic_Research_Fraud_Targeting_Under-Studied_Human_Genes_Causes_Consequences_and_Potential_Solutions","328838702_PANTHER_version_14_more_genomes_a_new_PANTHER_GO-slim_and_improvements_in_enrichment_analysis_tools","338318758_A_Literature-Based_Knowledge_Graph_Embedding_Method_for_Identifying_Drug_Repurposing_Opportunities_in_Rare_Diseases","338301013_A_Literature-Based_Knowledge_Graph_Embedding_Method_for_Identifying_Drug_Repurposing_Opportunities_in_Rare_Diseases","332782675_Extending_the_Small_Molecule_Similarity_Principle_to_All_Levels_of_Biology","328612348_PubChem_2019_update_improved_access_to_chemical_data","322873411_P-value_What_is_and_what_is_not","321082321_WikiPathways_A_multifaceted_pathway_database_bridging_metabolomics_to_other_omics_research","318661901_LimTox_A_web_tool_for_applied_text_mining_of_adverse_event_and_toxicity_associations_of_compounds_drugs_and_genes","317078129_LimTox_a_web_tool_for_applied_text_mining_of_adverse_event_and_toxicity_associations_of_compounds_drugs_and_genes","326555991_Why_a_P-Value_is_Not_Enough"]}
