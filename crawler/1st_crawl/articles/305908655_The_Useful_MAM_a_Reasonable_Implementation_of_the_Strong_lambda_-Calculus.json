{"id":"305908655_The_Useful_MAM_a_Reasonable_Implementation_of_the_Strong_lambda_-Calculus","abstract":"It has been a long-standing open problem whether the strong \\(\\lambda \\)-calculus is a reasonable computational model, i.e. whether it can be implemented within a polynomial overhead with respect to the number of \\(\\beta \\)-steps on models like Turing machines or RAM. Recently, Accattoli and Dal Lago solved the problem by means of a new form of sharing, called useful sharing, and realised via a calculus with explicit substitutions. This paper presents a new abstract machine for the strong \\(\\lambda \\)-calculus based on useful sharing, the Useful Milner Abstract Machine, and proves that it reasonably implements leftmost-outermost evaluation. It provides both an alternative proof that the \\(\\lambda \\)-calculus is reasonable and an improvement on the technology for implementing strong evaluation.","authors":["Beniamino Accattoli"],"meta":["August 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-3-662-52921-8_1","Conference: International Workshop on Logic, Language, Information, and Computation"],"references":["281487133_A_Strong_Distillery","222426616_WRS_2008_New_Developments_in_Environment_Machines","222245890_Parallel_Beta_Reduction_Is_Not_Elementary_Recursive","221662597_On_the_Invariance_of_the_Unitary_Cost_Model_for_Head_Reduction_LongVersion","221351029_Lambda_Calculi_and_Linear_Speedups","221241347_A_Compiled_Implementation_of_Strong_Reduction","220997338_Parallel_Beta_Reduction_is_not_Elementary_Recursive","220676840_Deriving_a_Lazy_Abstract_Machine","220404275_Sequent_Calculi_and_Abstract_Machines","220368224_Local_Bigraphs_and_Confluence_Two_Conjectures","213879117_Improving_the_lazy_Krivine_machine","45853428_Execution_Time_of_lambda-Terms_via_Denotational_Semantics_and_Intersection_Types","308730809_On_the_Relative_Usefulness_of_Fireballs","289587495_Leftmost-Outermost_Beta_Reduction_is_Invariant_Indeed","276295899_On_the_Relative_Usefulness_of_Fireballs","266660564_Distilling_Abstract_Machines","262393532_Deriving_the_full-reducing_Krivine_machine_from_the_small-step_operational_semantics_of_normal_order","262270408_A_synthetic_operational_account_of_call-by-need_evaluation","262210934_A_Nonstandard_Standardization_Theorem","221652967_Bohm_Trees_Krivine's_Machine_and_the_Taylor_Expansion_of_Lambda-Terms","221252265_An_Abstract_Machine_for_Lambda-Terms_Normalization","220607072_Strongly_reducing_variants_of_the_Krivine_abstract_machine","220606992_On_the_correctness_of_the_Krivine_machine","220152286_The_weak_lambda_calculus_as_a_reasonable_machine","213879084_Refocusing_in_Reduction_Semantics","2864306_Head_Linear_Reduction","2764863_Parallelism_in_Sequential_Functional_Languages"]}
