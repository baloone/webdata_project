{"id":"261325418_Entanglement_in_Quantum_Process_Algebra","abstract":"We explicitly model entanglement in quantum processes by treating\nentanglement as a kind of parallelism. We introduce a shadow constant quantum\noperation and a so-called entanglement merge into quantum process algebra qACP.\nThe transition rules of the shadow constant quantum operation and entanglement\nmerge are designed. We also do a sound and complete axiomatization modulo the\nso-called quantum bisimularity for the shadow constant quantum operation and\nentanglement merge. Then, this new type entanglement merge is extended into the\nfull qACP. The new qACP has wide use in verification for quantum protocols,\nsince most quantum protocols have mixtures with classical and quantum\ninformation, and also there are many quantum protocols adopting entanglement.","authors":["Yong Wang"],"meta":["November 2019International Journal of Theoretical Physics 58(2â€“3)","DOI:10.1007/s10773-019-04226-0","SourcearXiv"],"references":["258442243_An_Axiomatization_for_Quantum_Processes_to_Unifying_Quantum_and_Classical_Computing","220691349_Introduction_to_Process_Algebra","220431839_A_Theory_of_Communicating_Sequential_Processes","312685110_Quantum_cryptography_based_on_Bell's_theorem","270956456_A_Calculus_of_Mobile_Processes_Parts_I_and_II","224001269_Communication_and_Concurrency","222693645_The_origins_of_structural_operational_semantics","222565902_Probabilistic_bisimulations_for_quantum_processes","221598090_From_Quantum_Physics_to_Programming_Languages_A_Process_Algebraic_Approach","220248383_A_Calculus_of_Mobile_Processes_I","51969245_Open_Bisimulation_for_Quantum_Processes","45929402_Bisimulation_for_Quantum_Processes","220173526_Types_and_typechecking_for_Communicating_Quantum_Processes","220150532_A_brief_history_of_process_algebra","220118508_A_Structural_Approach_to_Operational_Semantics"]}
