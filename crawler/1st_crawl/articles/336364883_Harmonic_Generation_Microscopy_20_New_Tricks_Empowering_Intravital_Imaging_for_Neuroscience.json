{"id":"336364883_Harmonic_Generation_Microscopy_20_New_Tricks_Empowering_Intravital_Imaging_for_Neuroscience","abstract":"Optical harmonic generation, e.g., second- (SHG) and third-harmonic generation (THG), provides intrinsic contrasts for three-dimensional intravital microscopy. Contrary to two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF), however, they have found relatively specialized applications, such as imaging collagenous and non-specific tissues, respectively. Here we review recent advances that broaden the capacity of SHG and THG for imaging the central nervous system in particular. The fundamental contrast mechanisms are reviewed as they encode novel information including molecular origin, spectroscopy, functional probes, and image analysis, which lay foundations for promising future applications in neuroscience.","authors":["Hyungsik Lim"],"meta":["October 2019Frontiers in Molecular Biosciences 6:99","DOI:10.3389/fmolb.2019.00099"],"references":["335000333_Molecular_understanding_of_label-free_second_harmonic_imaging_of_microtubules","334042961_A_Method_to_Measure_Myeloarchitecture_of_the_Murine_Cerebral_Cortex_in_vivo_and_ex_vivo_by_Intrinsic_Third-Harmonic_Generation","333836480_High-performance_calcium_sensors_for_imaging_activity_in_neuronal_populations_and_microcompartments","330762182_Collagen_reorganization_in_cartilage_under_strain_probed_by_polarization_sensitive_second_harmonic_generation_microscopy","330403599_Comparative_Evaluation_of_Genetically_Encoded_Voltage_Indicators","330099802_Third_harmonic_generation_imaging_and_analysis_of_the_effect_of_low_gravity_on_the_lacuno-canalicular_network_of_mouse_bone","328677801_Microtubule_Imaging_Reveals_Cytoskeletal_Deficit_Predisposing_the_Retinal_Ganglion_Cell_Axons_to_Atrophy_in_DBA2J","328159406_Kinesin-binding-triggered_conformation_switching_of_microtubules_contributes_to_polarized_transport","321786251_Label-free_imaging_of_atherosclerotic_plaques_using_third-harmonic_generation_microscopy","333622907_Self-assembling_amyloid-like_peptides_as_exogenous_second_harmonic_probes_for_bioimaging_applications"]}
