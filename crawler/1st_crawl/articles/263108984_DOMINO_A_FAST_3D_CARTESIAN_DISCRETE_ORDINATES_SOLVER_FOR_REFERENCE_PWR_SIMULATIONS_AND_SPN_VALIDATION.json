{"id":"263108984_DOMINO_A_FAST_3D_CARTESIAN_DISCRETE_ORDINATES_SOLVER_FOR_REFERENCE_PWR_SIMULATIONS_AND_SPN_VALIDATION","abstract":"As part of its activity, EDF R&D is developing a new nuclear core simulation code named COCAGNE. This code relies on DIABOLO, a Simplified PN (SPN) method to compute the neutron flux inside the core for eigenvalue calculations. In order to assess the accuracy of SPN calculations, we have developed DOMINO, a new 3D Cartesian SN solver. The parallel implementation of DOMINO is very efficient and allows to complete an eigenvalue calculation involving around 300 × 10 9 degrees of freedom within a few hours on a single shared-memory supercomputing node. This computation corresponds to a 26-group S 8 3D PWR core model used to assess the SPN accuracy. At the pin level, the maximal error for the SP 5 DIABOLO fission production rate is lower than 0.2% compared to the S 8 DOMINO reference for this 3D PWR core model.","authors":["T.
