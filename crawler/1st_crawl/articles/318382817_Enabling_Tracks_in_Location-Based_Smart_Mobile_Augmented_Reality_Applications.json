{"id":"318382817_Enabling_Tracks_in_Location-Based_Smart_Mobile_Augmented_Reality_Applications","abstract":"To assist users through contemporary mobile technology is demanded in a multitude of scenarios. Interestingly, more and more users crave for mobile assistance in their leisure time. Consequently, the number of mobile applications that support leisure activities increases significantly. Mobile augmented reality applications constitute an example for user assistance that is welcome in these scenarios. In the AREA (Augmented Reality Engine Application) project, we developed a kernel that enables sophisticated location-based mobile augmented reality applications. On top of this kernel, various projects were realized. In many of these projects, a feature to enable tracks was demanded. Tracks, for example, may assist users in the context of mountaineering. The development of an AREA algorithm that enables track handling requires new concepts that are presented in this paper. To demonstrate the performance of the developed algorithm, also results of an experiment are presented. As a lesson learned, mobile augmented reality applications that want to make use of the new algorithm can be efficiently run on present mobile operating systems and be effectively realized by engineers using the AREA framework. Altogether, the new track feature is another valuable step for AREA towards a comprehensive location-based mobile augmented reality framework.","authors":["RÃ¼diger Pryss","Marc Schickler","Johannes Schobel","Micha Weilbach"],"meta":["December 2017Procedia Computer Science 110:207-214","DOI:10.1016/j.procs.2017.06.086"],"references":["306048375_Advanced_Algorithms_for_Location-Based_Smart_Mobile_Augmented_Reality_Applications","279922543_Using_Smart_Mobile_Devices_for_Collecting_Structured_Data_in_Clinical_Trials_Results_From_a_Large-Scale_Case_Study","275028545_Engineering_an_Advanced_Location-Based_Augmented_Reality_Engine_for_Smart_Mobile_Devices","275028518_Location-based_Mobile_Augmented_Reality_Applications_Challenges_Examples_Lessons_Learned","271837156_Towards_Process-Driven_Mobile_Data_Collection_Applications_Requirements_Challenges_Lessons_Learned","307573897_A_Client-Server_Framework_for_the_Design_of_Geo-Location_Based_Augmented_Reality_Applications","301710159_Mobile_Augmented_Reality_Authoring_Tool","300126177_An_Engine_Enabling_Location-Based_Mobile_Augmented_Reality_Applications","297684117_Mindful_navigation_for_pedestrians_Improving_engagement_with_augmented_reality","292576459_Mobile_augmented_reality_in_support_of_building_damage_and_safety_assessment"]}
