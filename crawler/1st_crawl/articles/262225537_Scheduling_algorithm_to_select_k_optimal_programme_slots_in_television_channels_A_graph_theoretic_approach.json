{"id":"262225537_Scheduling_algorithm_to_select_k_optimal_programme_slots_in_television_channels_A_graph_theoretic_approach","abstract":"In this paper, it is shown that all programmes of all television channels can\nbe modelled as an interval graph. The programme slots are taken as the vertices\nof the graph and if the time duration of two {programme slots} have non-empty\nintersection, the corresponding vertices are considered to be connected by an\nedge. The number of viewers of a programme is taken as the weight of the\nvertex. A set of programmes that are mutually exclusive in respect of time\nscheduling is called a session. We assume that a company sets the objective of\nselecting the popular programmes in $k$ parallel sessions among different\nchannels so as to make its commercial advertisement reach the maximum number of\nviewers, that is, a company selects $k$ suitable programme slots simultaneously\nfor advertisement. The aim of the paper is, therefore, to {help} the companies\nto select the programme slots, which are mutually exclusive with respect to the\ntime schedule of telecasting time, in such a way that the total number of\nviewers of the selected programme in $k$ parallel slots rises to the optimum\nlevel. It is shown that the solution of this problem is obtained by solving the\nmaximum weight $k$-colouring problem on an interval {graph}. An algorithm is\ndesigned to solve this just-in-time optimization problem using $O(kMn^2)$ time,\nwhere $n$ and $M$ represent the total number of programmes of all channels and\nthe upper bound of the viewers of all programmes of all channels respectively.\nThe problem considered in this paper is a daily life problem which is modeled\nby $k$-colouring problem on interval graph.","authors":["Madhumangal Pal","Anita Pal"],"meta":["September 2017International Journal of Applied and Computational Mathematics 3(3)","DOI:10.1007/s40819-016-0216-1","SourcearXiv"],"references":["271387782_An_cal_On2_logn_algorithm_for_the_weighted_stable_set_problem_in_claw-free_graphs","261799549_Intersection_Graphs_An_Introduction","257596820_An_improved_FPTAS_for_maximizing_the_weighted_number_of_just-in-time_jobs_in_a_two-machine_flow_shop_problem","330335702_Optimal_parallel_algorithms_for_the_recognition_and_colouring_outerplanar_graphs","313196027_Reducibility_among_combinatorial_problems","313191692_A_coloring_algorithm_for_interval_graphs","303177691_An_optimal_parallel_algorithm_for_computing_all_maximal_cliques_of_an_interval_graph_and_its_applications","284039089_Reducibility_among_combinatorial_problems","282840181_Towards_maximum_independent_sets_on_massive_graphs","265435621_Algorithm_Graph_Theory_and_Perfect_Graphs"]}
