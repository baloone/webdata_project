{"id":"245439966_Engineering_Spacecraft_Mission_Software_using_a_Model-Based_and_Safety-Driven_Design_Methodology","abstract":"This paper outlines an integrated approach to system, software, and safety engineering for today's complex, safety-critical systems. Intent Specifications, component-based systems engineering, and a new hazard analysis technique based on the Systems Theoretic Accident Modeling and Process (STAMP) are all combined in a seamless, safety-driven design methodology. This integrated approach to system software development is demonstrated through an example application of the techniques on a low-Earth orbiting satellite. The results of performing the system modeling, hazard analyses, and model simulations of the spacecraft as a whole are also presented. Finally, the approach is compared to other, current model-based systems engineering and hazard analysis techniques. Copyright Â© 2006 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.
