{"id":"327540568_Towards_a_Modern_Integrated_Virtual_Laboratory_System","abstract":"The aim of this paper is to give an overview on virtual and remote laboratory systems and to evaluate current solutions focusing on feasibility and applicability in higher education. Based on the conclusions of this evaluation, a new set of requirements are established against a modern virtual laboratory system. Finally, an overview of state of the art infocommunication technologies, including cognitive infocommunication are presented, which can help create high user experience in the new virtual laboratory environment. © 2018, Budapest Tech Polytechnical Institution.
