{"id":"302315209_Clock_Synchronization_and_Synchronous_Systems","abstract":"Previous chapters of this book have made a number of uses of clocks or time in distributed protocols. In this chapter, we look more closely at the underlying issues. Our focus is on aspects of real-time computing that are specific to distributed protocols and systems.","authors":["Ken Birman"],"meta":["January 2012","DOI:10.1007/978-1-4471-2416-0_19","In book: Guide to Reliable Distributed Systems (pp.571-586)"],"references":["225616516_An_overview_of_clock_synchronization","221621580_Uncertainty_and_Predictability_Can_They_Be_Reconciled","221344231_Early-Delivery_Atomic_Broadcast","221344156_Maintaining_the_Time_in_a_Distributed_System","220414160_Ordering_and_Timeliness_Requirements_of_Dependable_Real-Time_Programs","220404718_Using_Time_Instead_of_Timeout_for_Fault-Tolerant_Distributed_Systems","2619885_Using_Group_Communication_Technology_to_Implement_a_Reliable_and_Scalable_Distributed_IN_Coprocessor","321606151_Delta-4_A_Generic_Architecture_for_Dependable_Distributed_Computing","312917035_XAMp_A_multi-primitive_group_communications_service","261847691_Real-time_communication","245672233_Clock_synchronization_in_hard_real-time_distributed_systems","243784292_Fault-Tolerant_Internal_Clock_Synchronization","242405734_Delta4_a_generic_architecture_for_dependable_distributed_computing","234810829_Synchronous_and_asynchronous","234786000_Real-time_operating_system_of_MARS","234783636_Real_time_and_dependability_concepts","226568350_Practical_uses_of_synchronized_clocks_in_distributed_systems","225318994_Probablistic_Clock_Synchronization","224483414_Clock_Synchronization_in_Distributed_Real-Time_Systems","222207422_A_Dynamic_Light-Weight_Group_Service","221655802_Atomic_Broadcast_in_a_Real-Time_Environment","220960492_xAMp_A_Multi-primitive_Group_Communications_Service","220623988_Maintaining_the_Time_in_a_Distributed_System","220430751_Synchronizing_clocks_in_the_presence_of_faults","3670285_Strong_and_Weak_Virtual_Synchrony_in_Horus","3643336_Atomic_Broadcast_From_Simple_Message_Diffusion_to_Byzantine_Agreement","3556937_A_low-level_processor_group_membership_protocol_for_LANs","3513337_A_posteriori_Agreement_for_Fault-tolerant_Clock_Synchronization_on_Broadcast_Networksb","3214715_Distributed_Fault_Tolerance_Lessons_from_Delta-4","2428791_Agreeing_on_Processor_Group_Membership_in_Timed_Asynchronous_Distributed_Systems"]}
