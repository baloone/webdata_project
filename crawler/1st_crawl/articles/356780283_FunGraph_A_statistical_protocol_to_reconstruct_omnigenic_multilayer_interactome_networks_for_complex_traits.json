{"id":"356780283_FunGraph_A_statistical_protocol_to_reconstruct_omnigenic_multilayer_interactome_networks_for_complex_traits","abstract":"We describe a statistical protocol of how to reconstruct and dissect functional omnigenic multilayer interactome networks that mediate complex dynamic traits in a genome-wide association study (GWAS). This protocol, named FunGraph, can analyze how each locus affects phenotypic variation through its own direct effect and a complete set of indirect effects due to regulation by other loci co-existing in large-scale networks. FunGraph is applicable to any GWAS aimed to characterize the genetic architecture of dynamic phenotypic traits.\nFor complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Wang et al.
