{"id":"319526430_Discriminating_between_homodimeric_and_monomeric_proteins_in_the_crystalline_state","abstract":"Scores calculated from intermolecular contacts of proteins in the crystalline state are used to differentiate monomeric and homodimeric proteins, by classification into two categories separated by a cut-off score value. The generalized classification error is estimated by using bootstrap re-sampling on a nonredundant set of 172 water-soluble proteins whose prevalent quaternary state in solution is known to be either monomeric or homodimeric. A statistical potential, based on atom-pair frequencies across interfaces observed with homodimers, is found to yield an error rate of 12.5%. This indicates a small but significant improvement over the measure of solvent accessible surface area buried in the contact interface, which achieves an error rate of 15.4%. A further modification of the latter parameter relating the two most extensive contacts of the crystal results in an even lower error rate of 11.1%.
