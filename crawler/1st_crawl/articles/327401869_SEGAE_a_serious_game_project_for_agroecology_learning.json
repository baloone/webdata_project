{"id":"327401869_SEGAE_a_serious_game_project_for_agroecology_learning","abstract":"The main challenge of European agriculture is to provide food in sufficient quantity and quality while reducing its pressure on the environment. Agroecology seems a very relevant option to meet this challenge. The agroecological transition requires farmers, farm advisors and other agricultural professionals to have a holistic understanding of farming systems and agricultural practices, but most courses on agricultural science remain organized by discipline. There is thus an urgent need to develop more multidisciplinary and innovative approaches for agroecology teaching. This article presents a European project whose purpose is to develop an online serious game on agroecology. The main characteristics of the game are presented, as well as its intended uses. This serious game, as well as the other pedagogical resources produced during the project, is hoped to provide some useful material for a more multidisciplinary and experiential learning of agroecology in European Universities.","authors":["Olivier Godinot"],"meta":["July 2018","Conference: 13th European IFSA SymposiumAt: Chania, Greece","Project: Erasmus+ SEGAE: SErious Game on AgroEcology"],"references":["293013183_System-level_approach_needed_to_evaluate_the_transition_to_more_sustainable_agriculture","281505975_Applying_Dale's_Cone_of_Experience_to_increase_learning_and_retention_A_study_of_student_learning_in_a_foundational_leadership_course","265879885_Participatory_design_of_livestock_systems_adapted_to_new_climatic_conditions","259126506_Gaming_for_smallholder_participation_in_the_design_of_more_sustainable_agricultural_landscapes","251670699_Forage_rummy_A_game_to_support_the_participatory_design_of_adapted_livestock_systems","327101237_Agroecology_The_Science_of_Sustainable_Agriculture","325897049_Is_the_current_educational_landscape_suited_for_agroecology","316440434_An_emerging_signature_pedagogy_for_sustainable_food_systems_education","303110836_Game-based_Learning_and_21st_century_skills_A_review_of_recent_research","259144660_Agroecological_principles_for_the_redesign_of_integrated_crop-livestock_systems"]}
