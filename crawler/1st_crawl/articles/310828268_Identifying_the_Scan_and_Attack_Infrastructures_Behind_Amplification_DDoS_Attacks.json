{"id":"310828268_Identifying_the_Scan_and_Attack_Infrastructures_Behind_Amplification_DDoS_Attacks","abstract":"Amplification DDoS attacks have gained popularity and become a serious threat to Internet participants. However, little is known about where these attacks originate, and revealing the attack sources is a non-trivial problem due to the spoofed nature of the traffic.\nIn this paper, we present novel techniques to uncover the infrastructures behind amplification DDoS attacks. We follow a two-step approach to tackle this challenge: First, we develop a methodology to impose a fingerprint on scanners that perform the reconnaissance for amplification attacks that allows us to link subsequent attacks back to the scanner. Our methodology attributes over 58% of attacks to a scanner with a confidence of over 99.9%. Second, we use Time-to-Live-based trilateration techniques to map scanners to the actual infrastructures launching the attacks. Using this technique, we identify 34 networks as being the source for amplification attacks at 98\\% certainty.","authors":["Johannes Krupp","Michael Backes","Christian Rossow"],"meta":["October 2016","DOI:10.1145/2976749.2978293","Conference: the 2016 ACM SIGSAC Conference"],"references":["308811544_Inside_booters_An_analysis_on_operational_databases","283883204_Booters_-_An_analysis_of_DDoS-as-a-service_attacks","282790005_SIBRA_Scalable_Internet_Bandwidth_Reservation_Architecture","224281705_DDPM_Dynamic_Deterministic_Packet_Marking_for_IP_Traceback","220922510_Distributed_Denial_of_Service_Taxonomies_of_Attacks_Tools_and_Countermeasures","220080774_Single_packet_IP_traceback_in_AS-level_partial_deployment_scenario","3334868_Single-packet_IP_traceback","3301200_A_Divide-and-Conquer_Strategy_for_Thwarting_Distributed_Denial-of-Service_Attacks","2888465_An_Efficient_Probabilistic_Packet_Marking_Scheme_for_IP_Traceback","2879658_A_taxonomy_of_DDoS_attack_and_DDoS_Defense_mechanisms","2474220_Hash-based_IP_traceback","313005542_Practical_network_support_for_IP_traceback","312633054_Stress_Testing_the_Booters_Understanding_and_Undermining_the_Business_of_DDoS_Services","305976487_The_collector's_problem_with_group_drawings","300142083_AmpPot_Monitoring_and_Defending_Against_Amplification_DDoS_Attacks","284848729_Taming_the_800_pound_gorilla_The_rise_and_decline_of_NTP_DDoS_attacks","281058859_Stress_Testing_the_Booters_Understanding_and_Undermining_the_Business_of_DDoS_Services","269197056_Amplification_Hell_Revisiting_Network_Protocols_for_DDoS_Abuse","266335132_How_much_did_shutting_down_McColo_help","265366712_The_Collector's_Problem_with_Group_Drawings","264956810_Optimal_Strategies_for_Some_Repair_Replacement_Models","262218894_ZMap_fast_internet-wide_scanning_and_its_security_applications","254126731_DDoS_Survey_of_Traceback_Methods","244440938_RFC_2267_Network_ingress_ltering_Defeating_denial_of_service_attacks_which_employ_IP_source_address_spoo_ng","242529301_Network_Ingress_Filtering_Defeating_Denial_of_Service_Attacks_Which_Employ_IP_Source_Address_Spoofing","224248622_SCION_Scalability_Control_and_Isolation_on_Next-Generation_Networks","222672837_A_practical_and_robust_inter-domain_marking_scheme_for_IP_traceback","221655468_An_Algebraic_Approach_to_IP_Traceback","221164584_Hash-based_IP_traceback","220713852_Pi_A_Path_Identification_Mechanism_to_Defend_against_DDoS_Attack","220593729_An_Algebraic_Approach_to_IP_Traceback","220447225_On_deterministic_packet_marking","220428588_Large-Scale_IP_Traceback_in_High-Speed_Internet_Practical_Techniques_and_Information-Theoretic_Foundation","220269443_Using_router_stamping_to_identify_the_source_of_IP_packets","4195867_Efficient_probabilistic_packet_marking","3893853_Advanced_and_authenticated_marking_schemes_for_IP_traceback","3334767_Network_support_for_IP_traceback","3236408_StackPi_New_Packet_Marking_and_Filtering_Mechanisms_for_DDoS_and_IP_Spoofing_Defense","2911429_Pi_A_Path_Identification_Mechanism_to_Defend_against_DDoS_Attacks","2401742_Practical_Network_Support_for_IP_Traceback"]}
