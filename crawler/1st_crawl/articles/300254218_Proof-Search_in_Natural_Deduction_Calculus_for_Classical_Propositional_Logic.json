{"id":"300254218_Proof-Search_in_Natural_Deduction_Calculus_for_Classical_Propositional_Logic","abstract":"We address the problem of proof-search in the natural deduction calculus for Classical propositional logic. Our aim is to improve the usual na√Øve proof-search procedure where introduction rules are applied upwards and elimination rules downwards. In particular, we introduce NCR, a variant of the usual natural deduction calculus for Classical propositional logic, and we show that it can be used as a base for a proof-search procedure which does not require backtracking nor loop-checking.","authors":["Mauro Ferrari","Camillo Fiorentini"],"meta":["September 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-24312-2_17","Conference: International Conference on Automated Reasoning with Analytic Tableaux and Related Methods"],"references":["220888450_Automated_First_Order_Natural_Deduction","220298333_Normal_Natural_Deduction_Proofs_in_classical_logic","220298068_Cut-Elimination_and_a_Permutation-Free_Sequent_Calculus_for_Intuit_ionist_ic_Logic","344552720_Basic_Proof_Theory","321519944_Goal-Directed_Proof_Theory","277568698_An_Evaluation-Driven_Decision_Procedure_for_G3i","268902432_On_the_rules_of_suppositions_in_formal_logic","267660005_A_Terminating_Evaluation-Driven_Variant_of_G3i","266963290_Natural_Deduction_Hybrid_Systems_and_Modal_Logics","265883916_Goal-Directed_Proof_Theory","221349842_Normal_Natural_Deduction_Proofs_in_Non-classical_Logics","220308937_Strong_and_weak_points_of_the_MUSCADET_theorem_prover_-_examples_from_CASC-JC","2616935_Automated_Theorem_Proving"]}
