{"id":"334857825_The_Evaluation_of_Web_Based_Academic_Progress_Information_System_Using_Heuristic_Evaluation_and_User_Experience_Questionnaire_UEQ","abstract":"This research is aimed to evaluate the interface and user experience of SIsKa, and then to give recommendation of the system interface. SIsKA is a web-based information system which is developed to thesis management computer science department of post graduate students Ganesha University of education. This evaluation is aimed to identify the problems faced by the users when using the system and measure the respond of the user when interacting through the system. The interface evaluation is done by means of heuristic evaluation technic; meanwhile the evaluation of user experience is done by means of User Experience Questionnaire. In the heuristic evaluation done by three evaluators, it is found that there are 40 violations over the 10 Nielsen's principal. Based on the UEQ result, it is found that in 20 SIsKA users, the average score for each aspect are: attractiveness aspect is 1,59, perspicuity aspect is 1,75, efficiency aspect is 1,64, dependability aspect is 1,40, stimulation aspect is 1,56, and novelty aspect is 1,10. After comparing the average score in dataset product of UEQ Data Analysis Tool, it is found that the attractiveness, perspicuity, efficiency, and novelty aspects of SIsKA are categorized as good. The dependability aspect is categorized as above average, and stimulation aspect is categorized as excellent. The recommendation of interface of SIsKA users is focused on 10 most severe problems found in heuristic evaluation. This recommendation is done in the form of wireframe, so it will be easier to draw the real framework of the website. The result of this research can be used as the suggestion and reference for the SIsKA developers to improve the quality of SIsKA particularly on the system interface.","authors":["A A Istri Ita Paramitha","Gede Rasben Dantes","Gede Indrawan"],"meta":["October 2018","DOI:10.1109/IAC.2018.8780430","Conference: 2018 Third International Conference on Informatics and Computing (ICIC)"],"references":["324969780_Review_Desain_Interface_Aplikasi_Sopppos_Menggunakan_Evaluasi_Heuristik","312560944_Evaluation_and_measurement_of_Learning_Management_System_based_on_user_experience","292463044_Measuring_User_Experience_of_the_Student-Centered_e-Learning_Environment","279517571_A_Comparative_study_of_Usability_Evaluation_Methods","221217803_Construction_and_Evaluation_of_a_User_Experience_Questionnaire","303399891_Ten_usability_heuristics","283125128_Mobile_applications_rating_assessments_based_on_users_experience_perception","282984070_Heuristic_Evaluation_as_a_Complement_to_Usability_Testing_A_Case_Study_in_WEB_Domain","282161155_Usability_evaluation_of_web-based_interfaces_for_Type2_Diabetes_Mellitus","200086041_Finding_usability_problems_through_heuristic_evaluation"]}
