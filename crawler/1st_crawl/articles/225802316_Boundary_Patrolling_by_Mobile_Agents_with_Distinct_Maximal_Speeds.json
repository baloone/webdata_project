{"id":"225802316_Boundary_Patrolling_by_Mobile_Agents_with_Distinct_Maximal_Speeds","abstract":"A set of k mobile agents are placed on the boundary of a simply connected planar object represented by a cycle of unit length. Each agent has its own predefined maximal speed, and is capable of moving around this boundary without exceeding its maximal speed. The agents are required to protect the boundary from an intruder which attempts to penetrate to the interior of the object through a point of the boundary, unknown to the agents. The intruder needs some time interval of length τ to accomplish the intrusion. Will the intruder be able to penetrate into the object, or is there an algorithm allowing the agents to move perpetually along the boundary, so that no point of the boundary remains unprotected for a time period τ? Such a problem may be solved by designing an algorithm which defines the motion of agents so as to minimize the idle time I, i.e., the longest time interval during which any fixed boundary point remains unvisited by some agent, with the obvious goal of achieving I < τ.","authors":["Jurek Czyzowicz","Leszek Gasieniec","Adrian Kosowski","Evangelos Kranakis"],"meta":["August 2011","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-23719-5_59","Sourcedx.doi.org","Conference: Proceedings of the 19th European conference on Algorithms"],"references":["262273304_Behavioral_control_for_multi-robot_perimeter_patrol_A_Finite_State_Automata_approach","234820455_Euler_tour_lock-in_problem_in_the_rotor-router_model_i_choose_pointers_and_you_choose_port_numbers","226378807_Multi-Robot_Area_Patrol_under_Frequency_Constraints","225761489_Euler_Tour_Lock-In_Problem_in_the_Rotor-Router_Model","225586299_The_giving_tree_Constructing_trees_for_efficient_offline_and_online_multi-robot_coverage","224220716_On_Optimal_Cooperative_Patrolling","224156396_Moving_game_theoretical_patrolling_strategies_from_theory_to_practice_An_USARSim_simulation","226798775_Zwei_Stze_ber_inhomogene_diophantische_Approximation_von_Irrationalzehlen","226412515_Spanning-tree_based_coverage_of_continuous_areas_by_a_mobile_robot","225425420_A_Distributed_Ant_Algorithm_forprotect_Efficiently_Patrolling_a_Network"]}
