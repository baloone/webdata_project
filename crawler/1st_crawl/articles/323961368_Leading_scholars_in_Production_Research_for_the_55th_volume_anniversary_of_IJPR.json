To celebrate this\nanniversary, we decided to prepare a special double issue with papers by leading scholars in Production Research. The list of papers presented in this issue is reported in Table 1. The names of invited authors are in the first column in the alphabetical order. I am very happy, because the most distinguished colleagues in our domain have positively responded and submitted outstanding papers to this special issue. Initially we planned to publish 55 papers, but taking into account\nthe enthusiasm and extremely encouraging reaction of colleagues, we have decided to increase the number to 57 articles. All papers were reviewed by at least three referees and were accepted after at least a revision.","authors":["Alexandre Dolgui"],"meta":["January 2018International Journal of Production Research 56(1-2):1-9","DOI:10.1080/00207543.2018.1429119","Project: 55th Anniversary of Production Research"],"references":["273545869_Passing_the_torch","263371655_Outlets_for_operations_management_research_A_DEA_assessment_of_journal_quality_and_rankings"]}
