{"id":"224349527_Concatenated_Quantum_Codes_Constructible_in_Polynomial_Time_Efficient_Decoding_and_Error_Correction","abstract":"A method for concatenating quantum error-correcting codes is presented. The method is applicable to a wide class of quantum error-correcting codes known as Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes. As a result, codes that achieve a high rate in the Shannon-theoretic sense and that are decodable in polynomial time are presented. The rate is the highest among those known to be achievable by CSS codes. Moreover, the best known lower bound on the greatest minimum distance of codes constructible in polynomial time is improved for a wide range.","authors":["Mitsuru Hamada"],"meta":["January 2009IEEE Transactions on Information Theory 54(12):5689 - 5704","DOI:10.1109/TIT.2008.2006416","SourceIEEE Xplore"],"references":["220681365_Modular_curves_and_codes_with_a_polynomial_construction","12332437_Simple_Proof_of_Security_of_the_BB84_Quantum_Key_Distribution_Protocol","3811387_On_binary_constructions_of_quantum_codes","3080738_Improvement_of_Ashikhmin-Litsyn-Tsfasman_bound_for_quantum_codes","3080535_Nonbinary_Quantum_Stabilizer_Codes","3080498_A_low-complexity_algorithm_for_the_construction_of_algebraic-geometric_codes_better_than_the_Gilbert-Varshamov_bound","3079929_Enlargement_of_Calderbank-Shor-Steane_quantum_codes","3079924_On_binary_constructions_of_quantum_codes","3079541_Quantum_error_correction_via_codes_over_GF4","3079208_An_explicit_construction_of_a_sequence_of_codes_attaining_the_Tsfasman-Vladut-Zink_bound_The_first_steps","2759175_Quantum_Error_Correction_via_Codes_over_GF4","2506265_Good_Quantum_Error-Correcting_Codes_Exist","2201569_Quantum_Error_Correction_and_Orthogonal_Geometry","2201469_Multiple_Particle_Interference_and_Quantum_Error_Correction","1849436_Asymptotically_Good_Quantum_Codes","268715921_A_remark_on_algebraic_geometric_codes","268321118_Codes_on_Algebraic_Curves","266920593_Algebraic-geometric_codes_Transl_from_the_Russian","258239683_The_theory_of_error-correcting_codes_Parts_I_II","256775258_On_the_Asymptotic_Behaviour_of_Some_Towers_of_Function_Fields_over_Finite_Fields","245665156_Classical_and_Quantum_Computation","245550779_Quotient_Codes_and_Their_Reliability","242589487_The_Wire-tap_Channel","237607924_algebraic-geometric_codes","224061597_Conjugate_Codes_for_Secure_and_Reliable_Information_Transmission","220695837_Algebraic_Function_Fields_and_Codes","220618152_Factorization_of_Symmetric_Matrices_and_Trace-Orthogonal_Bases_in_Finite_Fields","27287267_The_theory_of_error_correcting_codes","13374808_Class_of_quantum_error-correcting_codes_saturating_the_quantum_Hamming_bound","4108875_Reliability_of_Calderbank-Shor-Steane_codes_and_security_of_quantum_key_distribution","3085849_Transitive_and_Self-dual_Codes_Attaining_the_Tsfasman-Vladut-Zink_Bound","3085738_Asymptotic_bounds_on_quantum_codes_from_algebraic_geometry_codes","3085660_Information_Rates_Achievable_With_Algebraic_Codes_on_Quantum_Discrete_Memoryless_Channels","3085272_The_Private_Classical_Capacity_and_Quantum_Capacity_of_a_Quantum_Channel","3085177_Sparse-Graph_Codes_for_Quantum_Error_Correction","3080467_Finding_the_defining_functions_for_one-point_algebraic-geometry_codes","3080465_Asymptotically_good_quantum_codes_exceeding_the_Ashikhmin-Litsyn-Tsfasman_bound","2827419_Efficient_Computations_of_Encodings_for_Quantum_Error_Correction","2199714_Conjugate_Codes_and_Applications_to_Cryptography","2199097_Several_Classes_of_Concatenated_Quantum_Codes_Constructions_and_Bounds","2191525_Tema_Con_Variazioni_Quantum_Channel_Capacity","2190927_Reliability_of_Calderbank-Shor-Steane_Codes_and_Security_of_Quantum_Key_Distribution","1960950_Constructive_Conjugate_Codes_for_Quantum_Error_Correction_and_Cryptography"]}
