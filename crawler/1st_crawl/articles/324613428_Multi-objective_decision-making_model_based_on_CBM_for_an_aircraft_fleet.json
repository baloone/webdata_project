{"id":"324613428_Multi-objective_decision-making_model_based_on_CBM_for_an_aircraft_fleet","abstract":"Modern production management patterns, in which multi-unit (e.g., a fleet of aircrafts) are managed in a holistic manner, have brought new challenges for multi-unit maintenance decision making. To schedule a good maintenance plan, not only does the individual machine maintenance have to be considered, but also the maintenance of the other individuals have to be taken into account. Since most condition-based maintenance researches for aircraft focused on solely reducing maintenance cost or maximizing the availability of single aircraft, as well as considering that seldom researches concentrated on both the two objectives: minimizing cost and maximizing the availability of a fleet (total number of available aircraft in fleet), a multi-objective decision-making model based on condition-based maintenance concentrated both on the above two objectives is established. Furthermore, in consideration of the decision maker may prefer providing the final optimal result in the form of discrete intervals instead of a set of points (non-dominated solutions) in real decision-making problem, a novel multi-objective optimization method based on support vector regression is proposed to solve the above multi-objective decision-making model. Finally, a case study regarding a fleet is conducted, with the results proving that the approach efficiently generates outcomes that meet the schedule requirements.","authors":["Bin Luo","Lin Lin"],"meta":["April 2018AIP Conference Proceedings 1955(1):040106","DOI:10.1063/1.5033770","Conference: ADVANCES IN MATERIALS, MACHINERY, ELECTRONICS II: Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Advances in Materials, Machinery, Electronics (AMME 2018)"],"references":["283742923_Multiobject_Reliability_Analysis_of_Turbine_Blisk_with_Multidiscipline_under_Multiphysical_Field_Interaction","275224285_Condition-Based_Maintenance_Strategy_for_Production_Systems_Generating_Environmental_Damage","266148542_A_condition-based_maintenance_strategy_for_heterogeneous_populations","263371888_Condition-based_maintenance_for_intelligent_monitored_series_system_with_independent_machine_failure_modes","260720119_Survey_of_Multiobjective_Evolutionary_Algorithms_for_Data_Mining_Part_II","257440241_Real-time_fault_detection_method_based_on_belief_rule_base_for_aircraft_navigation_system","257440215_Corrosion_Fatigue_Life_Prediction_of_Aircraft_Structure_Based_on_Fuzzy_Reliability_Approach","243964090_Multi-Objective_Optimization_of_Coordinated_Scheduling_of_Cranes_and_Vehicles_at_Container_Terminals","230767136_A_Model_for_Performance_Monitoring_of_Suppliers","223281423_An_approach_to_operational_aircraft_maintenance_planning","308343124_Heuristic_Hybrid_Game_Approach_for_Fleet_Condition-Based_Maintenance_Planning","301730148_Cumulative_damage_in_fatigue","286944232_Age-based_inspection_scheme_for_condition-based_maintenance","279270804_A_condition-based_maintenance_policy_for_multi-component_systems_with_a_high_maintenance_setup_cost","262892095_A_multi-objective_evolutionary_algorithm_for_EOL_product_recovery_optimization_Turbocharger_case_study","258569010_Optimization_of_Embedded_Sensor_Placement_for_Structural_Health_Monitoring_of_Composite_Airframes","258371182_Structural_Health_Monitoring_Sensor_Placement_Optimization_Under_Uncertainty","254059770_Benefits_and_Challenges_of_System_Prognostics","245331514_Impact_of_the_use-based_maintenance_policy_on_the_performance_of_cellular_manufacturing_systems","229328095_Prognostic_modeling_options_for_remaining_useful_life_estimation_by_industry","227424552_Optimal_Replacement_Policies_for_Two_Unit_Machines_with_Increasing_Running_Costs_-_II","224699137_Effect_of_Improving_Accuracy_of_Load_Monitoring_on_Aircraft_Probability_of_Failure","223365837_Calculating_derivatives_in_statistical_tolerance_analysis","223007227_Damage_tolerance_approach_for_probabilistic_pitting_corrosion_fatigue_life_prediction","3418687_A_fast_and_elitist_multiobjective_genetic_algorithm_NSGA-II"]}
