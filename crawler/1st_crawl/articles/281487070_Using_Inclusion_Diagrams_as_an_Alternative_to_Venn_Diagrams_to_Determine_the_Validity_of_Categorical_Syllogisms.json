{"id":"281487070_Using_Inclusion_Diagrams_as_an_Alternative_to_Venn_Diagrams_to_Determine_the_Validity_of_Categorical_Syllogisms","abstract":"Inclusion diagrams are introduced as an alternative to using Venn diagrams to\ndetermine the validity of categorical syllogisms, and are used here for the\nanalysis of diverse categorical syllogisms. As a preliminary example of a\npossible generalization of the use of inclusion diagrams, consideration is\ngiven also to an argument that includes more than two premises and more than\nthree terms, the classic major, middle and minor terms in categorical\nsyllogisms.","authors":["Osvaldo Skliar","Ricardo Monge","Sherry Gapper"],"meta":["September 2015","SourcearXiv"],"references":["266862040_Visual_Reasoning_with_Diagrams","347592299_Activities_A_Visual_Approach_to_Deductive_Reasoning","270187490_Methods_of_Logic","269447577_Symbolic_Logic","268011357_Diagrammatic_Representation_and_Reasoning","266831487_Diagrammatic_Reasoning_in_AI","37419506_Logical_Reasoning_with_Diagrams","3909558_A_visualization_method_for_knowledge_represented_by_general_logic_programs"]}
