{"id":"317797734_Student_Motivation_in_Response_to_Problem-based_Learning","abstract":"Problem-based learning (PBL) is a self-directed learning strategy where students work collaboratively in small groups to investigate open-ended relatable case scenarios. Students develop transferable skills that can be applied across disciplines, such as collaboration, problem-solving and critical thinking. Despite the extensive research on problem-based learning, an examination of variables that affect student engagement through the implementation of PBL is lacking (Savin-Baden, 2014; 2016). Our research question examined student motivation during problem-based learning implementation in an undergraduate anthropology course (N = 49) with students with diverse subject matter experience and no previous exposure to active learning. Student motivation was examined through surveys, peer-evaluations, and self-reflection exercises. The results showed that student motivation was higher in students with more subject matter experience at the beginning of the course. During the course, motivation decreased in relation to subject matter experience, but by the end of the course the majority of students (76.7%) increased their motivation toward problem-based learning. Based on their subject matter experience, we were surprised that a particular subset of students had low motivation at the end of the course (78%). We discuss some challenges of implementing problem-based learning in a traditional curriculum, and provide suggestions to successfully implement PBL for diverse student populations.","authors":["Sherry Fukuzawa","Cleo Leland Boyd","Joel Cahn"],"meta":["June 2017Collected Essays on Learning and Teaching 10:175","DOI:10.22329/celt.v10i0.4748"],"references":["308124933_The_Impact_of_Transdisciplinary_Threshold_Concepts_on_Student_Engagement_in_Problem-Based_Learning_A_Conceptual_Synthesis","275644117_Higher-Order_Thinking_Development_through_Adaptive_Problem-Based_Learning","259112545_Problem-based_learning_PBL_Getting_the_most_out_of_your_students_-_Their_roles_and_responsibilities_AMEE_Guide_No_84","258856791_A_Framework_for_Designing_Scaffolds_That_Improve_Motivation_and_Cognition","258182772_Effects_of_Problem-Based_Learning_A_Meta-Analysis_From_the_Angle_of_Assessment","313368112_Integrating_reflection_and_assessment_to_capture_and_improve_student_learning","303980251_Student_Engagement_in_a_Large_Classroom_Using_Technology_to_Generate_a_Hybridized_Problem-based_Learning_Experience_in_a_Large_First_Year_Undergraduate_Class","270297351_Student_perspectives_on_self-directed_learning","263458332_Saving_Face_Managing_Rapport_in_a_Problem-based_Learning_Group","257671143_Does_the_extent_of_problem_familiarity_influence_students'_learning_in_problem-based_learning"]}
