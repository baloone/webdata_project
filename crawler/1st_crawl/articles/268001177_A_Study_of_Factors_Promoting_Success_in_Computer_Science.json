{"id":"268001177_A_Study_of_Factors_Promoting_Success_in_Computer_Science","abstract":"This study was conducted to determine factors that promote success in an introductory college computer science course and to determine what, if any, differences appear between genders on those factors. The model included math background, attribution for success/failure, self-ef®cacy, encouragement, comfort level in the course, work style preference, previous programming exp-erience, previous non-programming computer experience, and gender as possible predictive factors for success in the computer science course. Subjects included 105 students enrolled in an introductory computer science course. The study revealed three predictive factors in the following order of importance: comfort level (with a positive in¯uence), math background (with a positive in¯uence), and attribution to luck (with a negative in¯uence). No signi®cant gender differences were found in these three factors. The study also revealed that both a formal class in programming (which had a positive correlation) and game playing (which had a negative correlation) were predictive of success. The study revealed a signi®cant gender difference in game playing with males reporting more experience with playing games on the computer than females reported.","authors":["Brenda Cantwell Wilson"],"meta":["August 2010Computer Science Education 12(1-2)","DOI:10.1076/csed.12.1.141.8211","Project: Identifying Success Factors in the study of Computer Science"],"references":["221538634_Women_in_introductory_computer_science_Experience_at_Victoria_University_of_Wellington","221537440_Activities_to_attract_high_school_girls_to_computer_science","221537235_Contributing_to_success_in_an_introductory_computer_science_course_A_study_of_twelve_factors","220613053_Becoming_a_computer_scientist","2831698_Activities_To_Attract_High_School_Girls_To_Computer_Science","2726979_PipeLINK_Connecting_Women_and_Girls_in_the_Computer_Science_Pipeline","313739531_An_accelerative_intervention_program_for_mathematically_gifted_girls","271729841_Development_and_Validation_of_Scores_on_a_Computer_Programming_Self-Efficacy_Scale_and_Group_Analyses_of_Novice_Programmer_Self-Efficacy","262205889_Our_Computer_Science_Classrooms_Are_They_Friendly_to_Female_Students","250183881_Sex-Related_Differences_in_Mathematics_Achievement_Spatial_Visualization_and_Affective_Factors","248766797_Social_foundations_of_action_A_social_-_cognitive_theory","238679166_Previous_Experience_and_The_Learning_of_Computer_Programming_The_Computer_Helps_Those_Who_Help_Themselves","234802302_Comfort_and_experience_with_computing_Are_they_the_same_for_women_and_men","234791760_The_Experience_of_Women_in_Undergraduate_Computer_Science_What_Does_the_Research_Say","234672419_Gender_Differences_in_Computer_Experience_Skills_and_Attitudes_among_Incoming_College_Students","233820393_Social_Foundations_of_Thought_Action_A_Social_Cognitive_Theory","229800923_Factors_related_to_the_decision_of_men_and_women_to_continue_taking_science_courses_in_college","227100145_The_Relationship_of_Computer_Self-Efficacy_Expectations_to_Computer_Interest_and_Course_Enrollment_in_College","226187838_Fostering_equitable_consequences_from_computer_learning_environments","225897847_Gender_Differences_in_Enrollment_in_Computer_Camps","221538271_An_unlevel_playing_field_Women_in_the_introductory_computer_science_courses","221537463_On_the_retention_of_female_computer_science_students","221537104_A_study_of_barriers_to_women_in_undergraduate_computer_science","220423387_Becoming_A_Computer_Scientist","38985600_Applied_Statistics_and_SAS_Programming_Language","34536272_Academic_computer_science_and_gender_a_naturalistic_study_investigating_the_causes_of_attrition","22308002_Self-Efficacy_-_Toward_A_Unifying_Theory_of_Behavioral_Change","4815775_Social_Cognitive_Theory_of_Self-Regulation"]}
