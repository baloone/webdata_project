{"id":"324857157_The_introductory_computer_programming_course_is_first_and_foremost_a_LANGUAGE_course","abstract":"An fMRI (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) study published in 2014 established that comprehension of computer programs occurs in the same regions of the brain that process natural languages---not logic, not math. The unexpectedness of this result was primed in part by the widespread belief that the language aspects of learning how to program are trivial when compared to learning to use programming languages for engineering tasks. In fact, though, the fMRI data is compelling cognitive evidence for the argument that the reason students have been failing introductory programming courses in large numbers---for decades---is because CS educators have underestimated the importance of teaching programming languages as languages per se. Despite the availability of this non-invasive technology for well over two decades, educators have neither researched the cognitive complexities of how programming languages might be acquired, nor tried to seriously understand this process in any degree of depth. Consequently, they have failed to consider what this evidence now implies: (a) that programming languages, despite being artificial languages, are alive in the brains of programmers in much the same way as any natural language that those programmers speak; and (b) that this new information about the cognitive aspects of programming languages has profound pedagogic implications.","authors":["Scott R.
