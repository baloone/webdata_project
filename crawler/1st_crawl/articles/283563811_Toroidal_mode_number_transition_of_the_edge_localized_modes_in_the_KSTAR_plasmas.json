{"id":"283563811_Toroidal_mode_number_transition_of_the_edge_localized_modes_in_the_KSTAR_plasmas","abstract":"Rapid transitions of the toroidal mode number (n) have been often detected during the evolution of the edge localized modes (ELMs) in the inter-ELM-crash periods of the KSTAR tokamak plasmas. The mode number transitions accompany changes of the mode frequency (fmode) (e.g. n changed from 8 to 5 while fmode changed from ∼32 to 9 kHz). The observed transition phenomena have been diverse including small and large increase (or decrease) in the mode number and multiple transitions during a single inter-ELM-crash period. Two classes of the mode transitions were identified: non-overlapping transition and overlapping transition. The former case is characterized by the absence of coherent filamentary structure during the transition and the latter case is characterized by co-existence of two coherent filamentary structures with different mode numbers. Each transition process typically lasts a few hundreds to thousands of μs.","authors":["J.E. Lee","Gunsu S. Yun","M.
