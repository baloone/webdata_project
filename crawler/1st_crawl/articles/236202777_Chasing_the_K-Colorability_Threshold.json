{"id":"236202777_Chasing_the_K-Colorability_Threshold","abstract":"Over the past decade, physicists have developed deep but non-rigorous\ntechniques for studying phase transitions in discrete structures. Recently,\ntheir ideas have been harnessed to obtain improved rigorous results on the\nphase transitions in binary problems such as random $k$-SAT or $k$-NAESAT\n(e.g., Coja-Oghlan and Panagiotou: STOC 2013). However, these rigorous\narguments, typically centered around the second moment method, do not extend\neasily to problems where there are more than two possible values per variable.\nThe single most intensely studied example of such a problem is random graph\n$k$-coloring. Here we develop a novel approach to the second moment method in\nthis problem. This new method, inspired by physics conjectures on the geometry\nof the set of $k$-colorings, allows us to establish a substantially improved\nlower bound on the $k$-colorability threshold. The new lower bound is within an\nadditive $2\\ln 2+o_k(1)\\approx 1.39$ of a simple first-moment upper bound and\nwithin $2\\ln 2-1+o_k(1)\\approx 0.39$ of the physics conjecture. By comparison,\nthe best previous lower bound left a gap of about $2+\\ln k$, unbounded in terms\nof the number of colors [Achlioptas, Naor: STOC 2004]. Furthermore, we prove\nthat, in a precise sense, our lower bound marks the so-called condensation\nphase transition predicted on the basis of physics arguments [Krzkala et al.:\nPNAS 2007].","authors":["Amin Coja-Oghlan","Dan Vilenchik"],"meta":["April 2013Foundations of Computer Science, 1975., 16th Annual Symposium on","DOI:10.1109/FOCS.2013.48","SourcearXiv"],"references":["263693411_Coloring_Random_Graphs","263005259_The_Condensation_Phase_Transition_in_Random_Graph_Coloring","313609388_On_the_evolution_of_random_graphs","313429549_The_analysis_of_a_list-coloring_algorithm_on_a_random_graph","284674055_On_the_Evolution_of_Random_Graphs","248664431_Every_planar_map_is_four_colorable_Part_I_Discharging","239761530_The_freezing_threshold_for_k-colourings_of_a_random_graph","239706348_Coloring_Random_Graphs_---_an_Algorithmic_Perspective","236589486_Upper-Bounding_the_k-Colorability_Threshold_by_Counting_Covers","235929805_Information_Physics_and_Computation"]}
