{"id":"223829889_Simultaneous_pattern_recognition_and_track_fitting_by_the_Kalman_filtering_method","abstract":"A progressive pattern recognition algorithm based on the Kalman filtering method has been tested. The algorithm starts from a small track segment or from a fitted track of a neighbouring detector, then extends the candidate tracks by adding measured points one by one. The fitted parameters and weight matrix of the candidate track are updated when adding a point, and give an increasing precision on prediction of the next point. Thus, pattern recognition and track fitting can be accomplished simultaneously. The method has been implemented and tested for track reconstruction for the vertex detector of the ZEUS experiment at DESY. Detailed procedures of the method and its performance are presented. Its flexibility is described as well.","authors":["P.
