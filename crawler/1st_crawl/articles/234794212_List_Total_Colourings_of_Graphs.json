{"id":"234794212_List_Total_Colourings_of_Graphs","abstract":"We study the concept of list total colourings and prove that every multigraph of maximum degree 3 is 5-total-choosable. We also show that the total choice number of a graph of maximum degree 2 is equal to its total chromatic number.","authors":["M. Juvan","B.
