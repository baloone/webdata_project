{"id":"307624014_Deterministic_Leader_Election_in_ODlog_n_Time_with_Messages_of_Size_O1","abstract":"This paper presents a distributed algorithm, called \\(\\mathcal{STT}\\), for electing deterministically a leader in an arbitrary network, assuming processors have unique identifiers of size \\(O(\\log n)\\), where n is the number of processors. It elects a leader in \\(O(D +\\log n)\\) rounds, where D is the diameter of the network, with messages of size O(1). Thus it has a bit round complexity of \\(O(D +\\log n)\\). This substantially improves upon the best known algorithm whose bit round complexity is \\(O(D\\log n)\\). In fact, using the lower bound by Kutten et al. [13] and a result of Dinitz and Solomon [8], we show that the bit round complexity of \\(\\mathcal{STT}\\) is optimal (up to a constant factor), which is a step forward in understanding the interplay between time and message optimality for the election problem. Our algorithm requires no knowledge on the graph such as n or D.","authors":["Arnaud Casteigts","Yves MÃ©tivier","John Michael Robson","Akka Zemmari"],"meta":["September 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-3-662-53426-7_2","Conference: International Symposium on Distributed Computing"],"references":["311473386_Analysis_of_fully_distributed_splitting_and_naming_probabilistic_procedures_and_applications","302376625_Deterministic_Leader_Election_in_OD_log_n_Time_with_Messages_of_Size_O1","276922998_Time_vs_Information_Tradeoffs_for_Leader_Election_in_Anonymous_Trees","344484997_Introduction_to_Distributed_Algorithms","326726361_Leader_Election_in_Well-Connected_Graphs","318576278_Impact_of_Knowledge_on_Election_Time_in_Anonymous_Networks","305081672_Election_vs_Selection_How_Much_Advice_is_Needed_to_Find_the_Largest_Node_in_a_Graph","278745400_Evaluation_des_algorithmes_distribues_--_Analyse_complexite_methodes","277296348_Distributed_Algorithms","270956471_Distributed_Systems_Principles_and_Paradigms"]}
