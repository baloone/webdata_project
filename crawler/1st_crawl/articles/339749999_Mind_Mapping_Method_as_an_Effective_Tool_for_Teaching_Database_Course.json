{"id":"339749999_Mind_Mapping_Method_as_an_Effective_Tool_for_Teaching_Database_Course","abstract":"Database system (DB) is one of the most important courses in computer science and software engineering disciplines. This course demands expertise in problem-analysis and problem-solving skills. Teaching problem-analysis and problem-solving skills is not an easy job. However, visual or mind mapped teaching methods are found effective during teaching such skills. Hence, the objective of this study is to measure the impact of mind mapping, one of the visual, method in teaching and learning DB course. The empirical data are collected by using experimental research approach. Total 68 students of 4th semester participated in the experiment from DB course offered in computer science and software engineering disciplines. All the students were exposed to descriptive teaching method and mind-mapped teaching method on the course topics. Based on the results, the mind-mapped teaching method is found effective in teaching and learning DB course. Additionally, girl students appeared more effective in yielding positive results than boy students during mind mapped taught classes. Finally, apart from fewer limitations, this study recommends certain future guidelines for better understanding and development in the very topic. For instance, age and culture based mind-mapped analysis may be considered for computer science and software engineering major courses as a future research.","authors":["Abdul Rehman Gilal","Ahmad Waqas","Aeshah Alsughayyir","Sajid Khan"],"meta":["March 2020International Journal of Innovative Technology and Exploring Engineering 8(5)","DOI:10.35940/ijitee.E2531.039520"],"references":["335873145_Efficient_Edge-Based_Image_Interpolation_Method_Using_Neighboring_Slope_Information","323796821_Task_Assignment_Model_for_Crowdsourcing_Software_Development_TAM","322874093_Data_Synchronization_Model_for_Heterogeneous_Mobile_Databases_and_Server-side_Database","319525771_Impact_of_Personality_on_Task_Selection_in_Crowdsourcing_Software_Development_A_Sorting_Approach","319491147_A_Rough-Fuzzy_Inference_System_for_Selecting_Team_Leader_for_Software_Development_Teams","312470401_Learningteaching_styles_in_engineering_education","297833919_The_Effect_of_Mind_Mapping_on_Teaching_and_Learning_A_Meta-Analysis","323949320_Teaching_programming_A_mind_map_based_methodology_to_improve_learning_outcomes","320675413_Finding_an_Effective_Classification_Technique_to_Develop_a_Software_Team_Composition_Model","306240330_Impact_of_software_team_composition_methodology_on_the_personality_preferences_of_Malaysian_students","276990456_Making_Programmer_Suitable_for_Team-Leader_Software_Team_Composition_Based_on_Personality_Types","271906975_A_Rule-based_Approach_for_Discovering_Effective_Software_Team_Composition","228765283_Instructional_strategy_in_the_teaching_of_computer_programming_A_need_assessment_analyses","228349436_Multimedia_Teaching_with_Video_Clips_TV_Movies_YouTube_and_mtvU_in_the_College_Classroom","296307849_A_Rule-Based_Model_for_Software_Development_Team_Composition_Team_Leader_Role_with_Personality_Types_and_Gender_Classification"]}
