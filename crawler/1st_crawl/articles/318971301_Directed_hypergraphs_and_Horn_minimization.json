{"id":"318971301_Directed_hypergraphs_and_Horn_minimization","abstract":"A Boolean function given in a conjunctive normal form is Horn if every clause contains at most one positive literal, and it is pure Horn if every clause contains exactly one positive literal. Due to their computational tractability, Horn functions are studied extensively in many areas of computer science and mathematics such as combinatorics, artificial intelligence, database theory, algebra and logic.\nThe present paper considers the problem of finding minimal representations of pure Horn functions. We give a new proof for a recent min–max result of Boros et al. regarding body-minimal representations. The proof is algorithmic and finds the so called Guigues–Duquenne basis. We also describe a new construction that combines two existing representations into a third one.","authors":["Kristóf Bérczi","Erika Bérczi-Kovács"],"meta":["August 2017Information Processing Letters 128","DOI:10.1016/j.ipl.2017.07.013"],"references":["221394276_Canonical_Horn_Representations_and_Query_Learning","221394090_Query_Learning_and_Certificates_in_Lattices","220897744_On_Approximate_Horn_Formula_Minimization","220616753_Minimal_Representation_of_Directed_Hypergraphs","224951762_On_implicational_bases_of_closure_systems_with_unique_critical_sets","222469115_Directed_Hypergraphs_And_Applications","222453106_Bidual_Horn_Functions_and_Extensions","222396830_Linear_Connectivity_Problems_in_Directed_Hypergraphs","220248768_Polynomial_Certificates_for_Propositional_Classes"]}
