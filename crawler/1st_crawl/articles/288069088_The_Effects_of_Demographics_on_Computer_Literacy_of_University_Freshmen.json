{"id":"288069088_The_Effects_of_Demographics_on_Computer_Literacy_of_University_Freshmen","abstract":"Four-year colleges and universities have invested time, faculty resources, and financial support in teaching introductory courses in Management Information Systems (MIS). Are these courses necessary? This article reports the development of a questionnaire on computer literacy that was administered to 430 freshmen students taking an introductory MIS course and to 43 students who had completed the course. Differences in performance are analyzed from the perspective of a variety of demographic factors, and the results of the study are reported.","authors":["Floyd J. Brock","Wayne E. Thomsen","John P.
