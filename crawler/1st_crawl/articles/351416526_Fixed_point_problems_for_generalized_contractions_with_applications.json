{"id":"351416526_Fixed_point_problems_for_generalized_contractions_with_applications","abstract":"In this paper, we investigate the conditions on the control mappings ψ, ϕ : (0, ∞) → R that guarantee the existence of the fixed points of the mapping T : X → P(X) satisfying the following inequalities: ψ(H(Tx, Ty)) ≤ ϕ(d(x, y)) ∀x, y ∈ X, provided that H(Tx, Ty) > 0, and ψ(H(Tx, Ty)) ≤ ϕ(A(x, y)) ∀x, y ∈ X, provided that H(Tx, Ty) > 0, where A(x, y) = max{d(x, y), d(x, Tx), d(y, Ty), (d(x, Ty) + d(Tx, y))/2}, and (X, d) is a metric space. The obtained fixed point results improve many earlier results on the set-valued contractions. As an application, we consider the existence of the solutions of an FDE.
