The goal of this research is to perform an extensive empirical analysis of Optimized Selection Sort against Selection Sort and Insertion Sort Algorithms. The results proved that Optimized Selection Sort is much more efficient than Selection Sort Algorithm; Furthermore analysis supports the fact that Optimized Selection Sort is better than Insertion Sort in worst case scenario.","authors":["Sultanullah Jadoon","Muhammad Salman Faiz Solehria","Mubashir Qayyum"],"meta":["April 2011"],"references":["238768209_On_Why_Parameters_of_Input_Distributions_Need_be_Taken_Into_Account_For_a_More_Precise_Evaluation_of_Complexity_for_Certain_Algorithms","220458853_A_Fast_Radix_Sort","3593069_A_new_efficient_radix_sort","247442902_Introduction_To_Algorithms","220688589_Introduction_to_Algorithms_Second_Edition","220431006_Analysis_of_Internal_Computer_Sorting","216457274_The_Art_Of_Computer_Programming_Vol3_Sorting_and_Searching","202232988_Algorithm_64_Quicksort","36966582_The_Art_of_Computer_Programming_-_Vol_3_Sorting_and_Searching","4038158_An_in-place_sorting_with_O_n_log_n_comparisons_and_O_n_Moves"]}
