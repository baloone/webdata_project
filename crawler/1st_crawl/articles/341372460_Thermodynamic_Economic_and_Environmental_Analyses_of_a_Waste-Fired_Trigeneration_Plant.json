{"id":"341372460_Thermodynamic_Economic_and_Environmental_Analyses_of_a_Waste-Fired_Trigeneration_Plant","abstract":"The global energy matrix is going to embrace more and more renewable-based combined energy systems. Therefore, multi-generation energy systems, like CHPs (combined heat and power) could be extremely beneficial for such integrated energy systems. Also, the trend is toward 100% sustainable production where both renewable and waste energy sources are of special value. Especially, in Europe, waste incineration has received special attention over the past decades, as not only it is a smart method of waste disposal, but also a measure of cheap and environmentally friendly energy production. This study proposes a municipal waste-driven tri-generation (cold, heat, and power) system and assesses how this solution helps for easier integration of energy sectors and having a more sustainable chain of energy supply. Then, the solution is comprehensively analyzed over thorough thermodynamic, thermoeconomic, and thermoenvironmental investigations. The results of the assessments show that the proposed trigeneration system may effectively operate in any energy systems with simultaneous cold, heat, and power demands. Thermal, exergetic, fuel-to-power, fuel-to-heat, and fuel-to-cold efficiencies are found to be 83.28, 25.69, 23.49, 47.41, and 12.38%, respectively, while the payback period of 6 years is obtained based on the net present method.","authors":["Hossein Nami","Amjad Anvari-Moghaddam","Ahmad Arabkoohsar"],"meta":["May 2020Energies 13(10):1-18","DOI:10.3390/en13102476","Project: HeatReFlex: Green and Flexible District Heating/Cooling"],"references":["333986805_Exergy_and_Exergoeconomic_Analysis_of_a_Combined_Cooling_Heating_and_Power_System_Based_on_Solar_Thermal_Biomass_Gasification","337778288_Exergoeconomic_assessment_with_reliability_consideration_of_a_green_cogeneration_system_based_on_compressed_air_energy_storage_CAES","337538571_Small-scale_CCHP_systems_for_waste_heat_recovery_from_cement_plants_Thermodynamic_sustainability_and_economic_implications","336641232_Thermodynamic_and_sustainability_analysis_of_a_municipal_waste-driven_combined_cooling_heating_and_power_CCHP_plant","335978146_Thermodynamic_analysis_of_compressed_air_energy_storage_CAES_hybridized_with_a_multi-effect_desalination_MED_system","335650531_Methanol_synthesis_from_renewable_H2_and_captured_CO2_from_S-Graz_cycle_-_Energy_exergy_exergoeconomic_and_exergoenvironmental_4E_analysis","335021186_Partial_Load_Operation_Analysis_of_Trigeneration_Subcooled_Compressed_Air_Energy_Storage_System","334509935_A_zero-dimensional_model_for_simulation_of_a_Diesel_engine_and_exergoeconomic_analysis_of_waste_heat_recovery_from_its_exhaust_and_coolant_employing_a_high-temperature_Kalina_cycle","333680743_Investigation_of_an_efficient_and_environmentally-friendly_CCHP_system_based_on_CAES_ORC_and_compression-absorption_refrigeration_cycle_Energy_and_exergy_analysis","333536907_District_cooling_system_via_renewable_energy_sources_A_review"]}
