{"id":"3248276_Version_Control_Systems","abstract":"Sane programmers don't write production code without the help of an editor and an interpreter or a compiler, yet the author has seen many software projects limping along without using a version control system. We can explain this contrast if we think in terms of the increased start-up costs and delayed gratification associated with adopting a VCS. We humans typically discount the future, and therefore implementing version control in a project appears to be a fight against human nature. It's true that you can't beat the productivity boost that compilers and editors provide, but four decades after punched-card programming in assembly language has gone out of fashion, we must now look elsewhere for our next efficiency gains. And if you or your project isn't using a VCS, adopting one might well be the single most important tooling improvement you can undertake.","authors":["Diomidis Spinellis"],"meta":["October 2005IEEE Software 22(5):108- 109","DOI:10.1109/MS.2005.140","SourceIEEE Xplore"],"references":["221016244_Towards_Awareness_in_the_Large","220662520_Collaborative_Development_Environments","297228975_GROUPWARE_-_SOME_ISSUES_AND_EXPERIENCES","220093007_Tactical_Approaches_for_Alleviating_Distance_in_Global_Software_Development","205976884_GROUPWARE_some_issues_and_experiences","3248363_Using_Wikis_in_software_development"]}
