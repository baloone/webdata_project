{"id":"262167521_A_methodology_proposal_for_developing_Adaptive_cMOOC","abstract":"Massive Open Online Courses or MOOCs, both in their major approaches xMOOC and cMOOC, are attracting a very interesting debate about their influence in the higher education future. MOOC have both great defenders and detractors. As an emerging trend, MOOCs have a hype repercussion in technological and pedagogical areas, but they should demonstrate their real value in specific implementation and within institutional strategies. Independently, MOOCs have different issues such as high dropout rates and low number of cooperative activities among participants. This paper presents an adaptive proposal to be applied in MOOC definition and development, with a special attention to cMOOC, that may be useful to tackle the mentioned MOOC problems.","authors":["Ángel Fidalgo Blanco","Francisco José García-Peñalvo","María Luisa Sein-Echaluce"],"meta":["November 2013","DOI:10.1145/2536536.2536621","Conference: Proceedings of the First International Conference on Technological Ecosystem for Enhancing Multiculturality"],"references":["286690038_Making_Sense_of_MOOCs_Musings_in_a_Maze_of_Myth_Paradox_and_Possibility","282017068_MOOCs_A_Systematic_Study_of_the_Published_Literature_2008-2012","267453244_MOOCs_a_Systematic_Study_of_the_Published_Literature_2008-2012","267034841_Massiveness_openness_new_literacies_of_participation","265096803_La_personalizacion_del_aprendizaje_un_objetivo_del_paradigma_educativo_centrado_en_el_aprendizaje","265069183_Teaching_Innova_Project_the_Incorporation_of_Adaptable_Outcomes_in_Order_to_Grade_Training_Adaptability","290759931_State-of-the-Field_Discussion","289329848_Adaptive_Assessments_using_Open_Specifications","285454339_The_First_Adaptive_MOOC_A_Case_Study_on_Pedagogy_Framework_and_Scalable_Cloud_Architecture-Part_I","260304862_MOOCs_So_many_learners_so_much_potential"]}
