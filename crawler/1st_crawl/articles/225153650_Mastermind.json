{"id":"225153650_Mastermind","abstract":"LetV(n, k) denote the set of vectors of lengthn whose components are integersj with 1≦j≦k. For every two vectorsx, y inV(n, k), leta(x, y) stand for the number of subscriptsi withx\n\ni\n=y\n\ni\n. We prove that for every positive ε there is ann(ε) with the following property: ifn>n(ε) andk<n\n1−ε then there is a setQ of at most (6+ε)(n logk)/(logn−logk) vectors inV(n, k) such that for every two distinct vectorsx, y inV(n, k) someq inQ hasa(q, x) ≠a(q, y).","authors":["Vaclav Chvatal"],"meta":["September 1983Combinatorica 3(3):325-329","DOI:10.1007/BF02579188","SourceDBLP"],"references":["268623419_The_Computer_as_a_Master_Mind"]}
