{"id":"254464280_Integrating_community_matching_and_outlier_detection_for_mining_evolutionary_community_outliers","abstract":"Temporal datasets, in which data evolves continuously, exist in a wide variety of applications, and identifying anomalous or outlying objects from temporal datasets is an important and challenging task. Different from traditional outlier detection, which detects objects that have quite different behavior compared with the other objects, temporal outlier detection tries to identify objects that have different evolutionary behavior compared with other objects. Usually objects form multiple communities, and most of the objects belonging to the same community follow similar patterns of evolution. However, there are some objects which evolve in a very different way relative to other community members, and we define such objects as evolutionary community outliers. This definition represents a novel type of outliers considering both temporal dimension and community patterns. We investigate the problem of identifying evolutionary community outliers given the discovered communities from two snapshots of an evolving dataset. To tackle the challenges of community evolution and outlier detection, we propose an integrated optimization framework which conducts outlier-aware community matching across snapshots and identification of evolutionary outliers in a tightly coupled way. A coordinate descent algorithm is proposed to improve community matching and outlier detection performance iteratively. Experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets show that the proposed approach is highly effective in discovering interesting evolutionary community outliers.","authors":["Manish Gupta","Jing Gao","Yizhou Sun","Jiawei Han"],"meta":["August 2012","DOI:10.1145/2339530.2339667"],"references":["235972703_A_Survey_of_Outlier_Detection_Methodologies_Reprint","225179594_Distance-Based_Outliers_Algorithms_and_Applications","221653516_On_Community_Outliers_and_their_Efficient_Detection_in_Information_Networks","221614844_Top-Eye_top-k_evolving_trajectory_outlier_detection","221214719_LOF_Identifying_Density-Based_Local_Outliers","220966381_Outlier_detection_in_graph_streams","220906981_Outlier_Detection_with_Uncertain_Data","220766091_LOADED_Link-Based_Outlier_and_Anomaly_Detection_in_Evolving_Data_Sets","220765821_Combining_Multiple_Clusterings_by_Soft_Correspondence","220638052_A_Survey_of_Outlier_Detection_Methodologies","220565847_Anomaly_Detection_A_Survey","220320645_Java-ML_a_Machine_Learning_Library","6346845_CLUMPP_A_Cluster_Matching_and_Permutation_Program_for_Dealing_with_Label_Switching_and_Multimodality_in_Analysis_of_Population_Structure","4250603_Incremental_Local_Outlier_Detection_for_Data_Streams","3192354_Motion_Estimation_Via_Cluster_Matching","2890287_Robust_Anomaly_Detection_Using_Support_Vector_Machines","2401320_Outlier_Detection_for_High_Dimensional_Data","2346156_Algorithms_for_Mining_Distance-Based_Outliers_in_Large_Datasets","265370846_Outliers_in_Time_Series","243797833_Computer_analysis_of_two-dimensional_gels_Automatic_matching","221620234_Graph-based_Consensus_Maximization_among_Multiple_Supervised_and_Unsupervised_Models","221613320_LoOP_Local_outlier_probabilities","221345596_Anomaly_Detection_over_Noisy_Data_using_Learned_Probability_Distributions","221212827_Efficient_Algorithms_for_Mining_Outliers_from_Large_Data_Sets","221079378_Voting-Merging_An_Ensemble_Method_for_Clustering","220907251_Interpreting_and_Unifying_Outlier_Scores","220765703_iTopicModel_Information_Network-Integrated_Topic_Modeling","10712256_Bagging_to_improve_the_accuracy_of_a_clustering_procedure","4331012_Trajectory_Outlier_Detection_A_Partition-and-Detect_Framework","4022901_Discovering_clusters_in_motion_time-series_data","2563763_Discovering_Clusters_in_Motion_Time-Series_Data","2557333_Learning_to_Match_and_Cluster_Large_High-Dimensional_Data_Sets_For_Data_Integration","2364634_Efficient_Algorithms_for_Mining_Outliers_from_Large_Data_Sets"]}
