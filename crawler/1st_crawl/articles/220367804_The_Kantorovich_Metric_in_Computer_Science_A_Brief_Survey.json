{"id":"220367804_The_Kantorovich_Metric_in_Computer_Science_A_Brief_Survey","abstract":"In contrast to its wealth of applications in mathematics, the Kantorovich metric started to be noticed in computer science only in recent years. We give a brief survey of its applications in probabilistic concurrency, image retrieval, data mining, and bioinformatics. This paper highlights the usefulness of the Kantorovich metric as a general mathematical tool for solving various kinds of problems in rather unrelated domains.","authors":["Yuxin Deng","Wenjie Du"],"meta":["November 2009Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science 253(3):73-82","DOI:10.1016/j.entcs.2009.10.006","SourceDBLP"],"references":["312913129_On_the_translocation_of_masses","283870998_Statistical_analysis_of_large_DNA_sequences_using_distribution_of_DNA_words","279614188_The_Emerging_Mortgage_Markets_in_China","268020299_Probability_Metrics_and_the_Stability_of_Stochastic_Models","266988294_On_a_Space_of_Completely_Additive_Functions","266195338_The_Monge_distance_between_quantum_states","257606276_On_the_Translocation_of_Masses","245275923_An_algorithm_for_quantitative_verification_of_probabilistic_systems","241382847_Similarity-based_retrieval_of_images_using_color_histograms","239230352_Topics_in_Optimal_Transportation_Theory"]}
