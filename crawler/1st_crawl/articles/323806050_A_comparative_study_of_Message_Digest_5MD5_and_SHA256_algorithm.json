{"id":"323806050_A_comparative_study_of_Message_Digest_5MD5_and_SHA256_algorithm","abstract":"The document is a collection of written or printed data containing information. The more rapid advancement of technology, the integrity of a document should be kept. Because of the nature of an open document means the document contents can be read and modified by many parties so that the integrity of the information as a content of the document is not preserved. To maintain the integrity of the data, it needs to create a mechanism which is called a digital signature. A digital signature is a specific code which is generated from the function of producing a digital signature. One of the algorithms that used to create the digital signature is a hash function. There are many hash functions. Two of them are message digest 5 (MD5) and SHA256. Those both algorithms certainly have its advantages and disadvantages of each. The purpose of this research is to determine the algorithm which is better. The parameters which used to compare that two algorithms are the running time and complexity. The research results obtained from the complexity of the Algorithms MD5 and SHA256 is the same, i.e., (N), but regarding the speed is obtained that MD5 is better compared to SHA256.","authors":["Dian Rachmawati","Jos Timanta Tarigan","A B C Ginting"],"meta":["March 2018Journal of Physics Conference Series 978(1):012116","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/978/1/012116","Project: Cryptography"],"references":["317096093_Cryptanalyzing_of_Message_Digest_Algorithms_MD4_and_MD5","311019269_DESIGN_AND_IMPLEMENTATION_A_NEW_SECURITY_HASH_ALGORITHM_BASED_ON_MD5_AND_SHA-256","263656830_A_Comparative_Analysis_of_SHA_and_MD5_Algorithm","258650505_New_modified_256-bit_MD5_Algorithm_with_SHA_Compression_Function","220692915_Applied_cryptography_Protocols_algorithms_and_source_code_in_C_2nd_ed","27475467_Cryptographic_hash_functions_cryptanalysis_design_and_applications"]}
