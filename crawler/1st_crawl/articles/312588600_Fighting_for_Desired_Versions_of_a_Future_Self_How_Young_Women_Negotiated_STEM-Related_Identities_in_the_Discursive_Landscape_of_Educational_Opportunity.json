{"id":"312588600_Fighting_for_Desired_Versions_of_a_Future_Self_How_Young_Women_Negotiated_STEM-Related_Identities_in_the_Discursive_Landscape_of_Educational_Opportunity","abstract":"In this paper, we investigate how the national imperative to increase opportunities for young women of color in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) and to broaden their participation was taken up locally at two high schools in one school district. Using ethnographic and longitudinal data, we focus on four young women of color (two at each school) as they negotiated STEM-related identities in the discursive and practice contexts of their lives at school. Using Holland and Lave’s concept of history-in-person (2001, 2009), we view the young women as fighting for particular versions of a future self, while entangled in discursive and social relations that threatened to position them differently than they wished to be. Initially we interpreted the STEM-related successes of these young women as evidence of resisting the historical narrative that positions them as disinterested, unprepared, or unsupported in STEM. In some respects, they did counter this narrative. However, as we began to look more closely at their words and actions over the course of high school and beyond, we came to see that their fight for future selves was not—for them – with the national narrative about STEM, but with local school narratives that negatively positioned students of color more broadly and remained silent on issues of gender, the intersection of gender and race, and the implications for STEM. High school success in STEM came as a hopeful but potentially fragile byproduct of struggles to differentiate themselves from people like them (other Blacks, Latinas, the poor). These findings suggest a need for an explicit naming and examination of the “double bind” that young women of color experience as they move through school learning environments and for special support to prepare them for the benefits and challenges they may face in STEM-related college programs or workplaces.","authors":["Carrie D Allen","Margaret Eisenhart"],"meta":["February 2017Journal of the Learning Sciences 26(3)","DOI:10.1080/10508406.2017.1294985"],"references":["281493366_In_the_Guise_of_STEM_Education_Reform_Opportunity_Structures_and_Outcomes_in_Inclusive_STEM-Focused_High_Schools","278171857_Racial_Storylines_and_Implications_for_Learning","273511366_Intersectionality_as_a_framework_for_understanding_diverse_young_women's_commitment_to_engineering","271529571_Double_Jeopardy_Gender_Bias_Against_Women_of_Color_in_Science","263844656_Desettling_Expectations_in_Science_Education","260106843_Crafting_a_Future_in_Science_Tracing_Middle_School_Girls'_Identity_Work_Over_Time_and_Space","253561561_Ethnic_and_Academic_Identities_A_Cultural_Practice_Perspective_on_Emerging_Tensions_and_Their_Management_in_the_Lives_of_Minority_Students","236803533_Imaginary_Engineering_or_Re-imagined_Engineering_Negotiating_Gendered_Identities_in_the_Borderland_of_a_College_of_Engineering","226695630_Identity_Production_in_Figured_Worlds_How_Some_Mexican_Americans_Become_Chicanao_Activist_Educators","330864961_Blacked_Out_Dilemmas_of_Race_Identity_and_Success_at_Capital_High","305490163_Hollowed_Out_Meaning_and_Authoring_of_High_School_Math_and_Science_Identities_in_the_Context_of_Neoliberal_Reform","298718872_Intersectionalities_of_race_and_gender_and_leadership","289383729_Social_practice_theory_and_the_historical_production_of_persons","287007273_Colormute_Race_Talk_Dilemmas_in_an_American_School","282987834_Learning_environments_in_and_out_of_school","281562381_The_Dialogic_Imagination_Four_Essays","281453430_Black_Out_Dilemmas_of_Race_Identity_and_Success_at_Capital_High","281032654_Identity_and_Agency_in_Cultural_Words","277928425_Inside_the_Double_Bind_A_Synthesis_of_Empirical_Research_on_Undergraduate_and_Graduate_Women_of_Color_in_Science_Technology_Engineering_and_Mathematics","277926242_Pipelines_and_Pathways_Women_of_Color_in_Undergraduate_STEM_Majors_and_the_College_Experiences_That_Contribute_to_Persistence","275838409_Women's_Science_Learning_and_Succeeding_from_the_Margins","272946469_Agency_amidst_formidable_structures_How_girls_perform_gender_in_science_class","272927607_Keeping_Track_How_Schools_Structure_Inequality","272566756_Qualitative_Data_Analysis_A_Methods_Sourcebook","271766986_High_School_Opportunities_for_STEM_Comparing_Inclusive_STEM-focused_and_Comprehensive_High_Schools_in_Two_US_Cities","268273843_The_Double_Bind_The_Price_of_Being_a_Minority_Woman_in_Science","261944927_Exploring_Differential_Effects_of_Mathematics_Courses_on_Mathematics_Achievement","261442632_Becoming_Less_Scientific_A_Longitudinal_Study_of_Students'_Identity_Work_From_Elementary_to_Middle_School_Science","259543350_What_Comes_to_Mind_When_You_Think_of_Science_ThePerfumery_Documenting_Science-Related_Cultural_Learning_Pathways_Across_Contexts_and_Timescales","258723136_Stability_and_Volatility_of_STEM_Career_Interest_in_High_School_A_Gender_Study","250185374_Chapter_3_Identity_as_an_Analytic_Lens_for_Research_in_Education","249803017_Racial-Ethnic_Differences_at_the_Intersection_of_Math_Course-taking_and_Achievement","246601432_Keeping_track_How_schools_structure_inequality","240619618_I_Wish_that_I_Belonged_More_in_this_Whole_Engineering_Group_Achieving_Individual_Diversity","231796886_Intersectionality_as_a_Normative_and_Empirical_Paradigm","230822314_Participating_in_Science_at_Home_Recognition_Work_and_Learning_in_Biology","230160708_Assessing_Equity_Beyond_Knowledge-_and_Skills-Based_Outcomes_A_Comparative_Ethnography_of_Two_Fourth-Grade_Reform-Based_Science_Classrooms","229788999_Performing_Race_in_Four_Culturally_Diverse_Fourth_Grade_Classrooms_Silence_Race_Talk_and_the_Negotiation_of_Social_Boundaries","227730166_Understanding_the_science_experiences_of_women_of_color_Science_identity_as_an_analytic_lens_Journal_of_Research_in_Science_Teaching_448_1187-1218","200465328_Case_Study_Research_Design_Methods","37687578_Women's_Science_Learning_and_Succeeding_from_the_Margins"]}
