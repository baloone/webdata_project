{"id":"301846899_Implicit_Kripke_Semantics_and_Ultraproducts_in_Stratified_Institutions","abstract":"We propose stratified institutions (a decade old generalized version of the theory of institutions of Goguen and Burstall) as a fully abstract model theoretic\napproach to modal logic. This allows for a uniform treatment of model theoretic aspects across the great multiplicity of contemporary\nmodal logic systems. Moreover, Kripke semantics (in all its manifold variations) is captured in an implicit manner free from\nthe sometimes bulky aspects of explicit Kripke structures, also accommodating other forms of concrete semantics for modal\nlogic systems. The conceptual power of stratified institutions is illustrated with the development of a modal ultraproducts\nmethod that is independent of the concrete details of the actual modal logical systems. Consequently, a wide array of compactness\nresults in concrete modal logics may be derived easily.","authors":["RÄƒzvan Diaconescu"],"meta":["February 2016Journal of Logic and Computation 27(5)","DOI:10.1093/logcom/exw018"],"references":["274151032_Quasi-varieties_and_initial_semantics_for_hybridized_institutions","233833149_Institution-independent_Ultraproducts","225455396_Hybridization_of_Institutions","220111680_Stratified_institutions_and_elementary_homomorphisms","2241668_Hierarchies_of_Modal_and_Temporal_Logics_with_Reference_Pointers","2240425_Representation_Reasoning_and_Relational_Structures_A_Hybrid_Logic_Manifesto","344486660_Modal_Logic","321525659_First-Order_Modal_Logic","321509003_Monographs_in_Theoretical_Computer_Science_An_EATCS_Series","280721389_Encoding_hybridized_institutions_into_first-order_logic","274269335_Past_Present_and_Future","268643346_Quelques_Remarques_Theoremes_Et_Problemes_Sur_Les_Classes_Definissables_D'algebres","266524057_Modal_Logic","246227416_Foundations_of_Algebraic_Specifications_and_Formal_Program_Development","243768073_Abstract_and_Concrete_Categories","243766473_Many-Dimensional_Modal_Logics_Theory_and_Applications","242909357_First-Order_Modal_Logic","233851660_Institution-independent_Model_Theory","224773283_Past_Present_and_Future","222823398_Ultraproducts_and_possible_worlds_semantics_in_institutions","221302404_Set_Theory_Higher_Order_Logic_or_Both","221233538_Bits_and_Pieces_of_the_Theory_of_Institutions","220693450_Foundations_of_Algebraic_Specification_and_Formal_Software_Development","220574057_Quasi-varieties_in_Abstract_Algebraic_Institutions","220431549_Institutions_Abstract_Model_Theory_for_Specification_and_Programming"]}
