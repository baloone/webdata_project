{"id":"277013366_Stochastic_Failure_Prognosability_of_Discrete_Event_Systems","abstract":"We study the prognosis of fault, i.e., its prediction prior to its occurrence, in stochastic discrete event systems. We introduce the notion of $m$-steps Stochastic-Prognosability, called $S_{m} $-Prognosability, which allows the prediction of a fault at least $m$-steps in advance. We formalize the notion of a prognoser and also show that $S_{m} $-Prognosability is necessary and sufficient for the existence of a prognoser that can predict a fault at least $m$-steps prior to occurrence, while achieving any arbitrary false alarm and missed detection rates. We also provide a polynomial algorithm for the verification of $S_{m} $-Prognosability. Finally, we compare the notion of stochastic prognosability with that of stochastic diagnosability, and show that the former is a stronger notion, as can be expected.","authors":["Jun Chen","Ratnesh Kumar"],"meta":["June 2015IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control 60(6):1570-1581","DOI:10.1109/TAC.2014.2381437"],"references":["266372691_Research_Report_on_Quantifying_Opacity","260662351_Probabilistic_Language_Formalism_for_Stochastic_Discrete_Event_Systems","254058701_Distributed_Failure_Prognosis_of_Discrete_Event_Systems_With_Bounded-Delay_Communications","237012713_Predictability_of_Event_Occurrences_in_Timed_Systems","224181787_Inference-Based_Decentralized_Prognosis_in_Discrete_Event_Systems","224084335_Decentralized_Prognosis_of_Failures_in_Discrete_Event_Systems","221406696_Quantifying_Opacity","3224356_Efficient_State_Classification_of_Finite-State_Markov_Chains","3032073_Diagnosability_of_stochastic_discrete-event_systems","303171133_Intelligent_fault_diagnosis_and_prognosis_for_engineering_systems_Methods_and_case_studies","277013359_Decentralized_Failure_Diagnosis_of_Stochastic_Discrete_Event_Systems","273161723_Failure_Detection_Framework_for_Stochastic_Discrete_Event_Systems_With_Guaranteed_Error_Bounds","260735138_Online_failure_diagnosis_of_stochastic_discrete_event_systems","260662628_Polynomial_Test_for_Stochastic_Diagnosability_of_Discrete-Event_Systems","234782082_Crowds_Anonymity_for_Web_Transactions","222549888_A_language_measure_for_performance_evaluation_of_discrete-event_supervisory_control_systems","220778957_Scaling_Algorithms_for_the_Shortest_Paths_Problem","220617153_Scaling_Algorithms_for_the_Shortest_Paths_Problem","220156357_Predictability_of_Event_Occurrences_in_Partially-Observed_Discrete-Event_Systems","3960198_Probabilistic_Analysis_of_Anonymity"]}
