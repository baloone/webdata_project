The software system proposed here involves the flexible integration of virtual models of various devices used in the process: furnace, descalers, rolling stands, accelerated cooling systems, and coiler. The user can configure an arbitrary sequence of operations and perform simulations for this sequence. The main idea of the system and its implementation details are described in the paper. Besides the computer science part, the material models describing the rolling parameters, microstructure evolution, phase transformations, and product properties are also presented. Effect of precipitation was accounted for various stages of the rolling cycle. Experimental tests were performed to generate data for identification of the models. These include plastometric tests, two-step compression tests, and dilatometric tests. Following this, physical simulations of rolling cycles were performed on Gleeble 3800 to supply data for the verification and validation of the models. Finally, case studies of modern industrial processes were performed, and the selected results are presented.","authors":["≈Åukasz Rauch","Krzysztof Bzowski","Kuziak","Pello Uranga"],"meta":["June 2019Metals - Open Access Metallurgy Journal 9(7):737","DOI:10.3390/met9070737"],"references":["309401339_The_off-line_computer_system_for_design_of_the_hot_rolling_and_laminar_cooling_technology_for_steel_strips","269094467_Hot_Rolled_Coil_Property_Heterogeneities_due_to_Coil_Cooling_Impact_and_Prediction","267340262_Conventional_and_Multiscale_Modeling_of_Microstructure_Evolution_During_Laminar_Cooling_of_DP_Steel_Strips","261994643_Massively_Scalable_Platform_for_Data_Farming_Supporting_Heterogeneous_Infrastructure","327514095_Development_of_the_material_database_for_the_virtroll_computer_system_dedicated_to_design_of_an_optimal_hot_strip_rolling_technology","296934666_Structure_of_the_metallurgically_oriented_modelling_system_TK-StripCam_for_simulation_of_hot_strip_manufacture_and_application_in_research_and_production_practice","287637703_Physical_and_numerical_simulation_of_the_manufacturing_chain_for_the_DP_steel_strips","285078823_Finite_element_based_model_of_structure_development_in_the_hot_rolling_process","257339358_Generalization_of_the_existing_relations_between_microstructure_and_yield_stress_from_ferrite-pearlite_to_high_strength_steels","250344883_New_Microalloyed_Steel_Applications_for_the_Automotive_Sector"]}
