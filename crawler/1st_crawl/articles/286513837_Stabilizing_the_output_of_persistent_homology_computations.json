{"id":"286513837_Stabilizing_the_output_of_persistent_homology_computations","abstract":"We propose a general technique for extracting a larger set of stable\ninformation from persistent homology computations than is currently done. The\npersistent homology algorithm is generally seen as a procedure which starts\nwith a filtered complex and ends with a persistence diagram. This procedure is\nstable (at least to certain types of pertur- bations of the input), and so\nusing the diagram as a signature of the input - for example, deriving features\nfrom it that are then used in machine learning - is a well-justified con- cept.\nHowever, these computations also produce a great deal of other potentially\nuseful but unstable information: for example, each point in the diagram\ncorresponds to a specific positive simplex. In addition, the persistence\ndiagram is not stable with respect to other procedures that are employed in\npractice, such as thresholding a point cloud by density. We recast these\nproblems as real-valued functions which are discontinuous but measur- able, and\nthen observe that convolving such a function with a Lipschitz function produces\na Lipschitz function. The resulting stable function is easily estimated. We\nillustrate this approach with numerous examples and several experiments.","authors":["Paul Bendich","Peter Bubenik"],"meta":["June 2020Journal of Applied and Computational Topology 4(1)","DOI:10.1007/s41468-019-00044-9","SourcearXiv"],"references":["352495063_Ripser_efficient_computation_of_Vietoris-Rips_persistence_barcodes","320978478_Using_persistent_homology_and_dynamical_distances_to_analyze_protein_binding","314091998_Supervised_Learning_of_Labeled_Pointcloud_Differences_via_Cover-Tree_Entropy_Reduction","282790268_Statistical_Analysis_of_Persistence_Intensity_Functions","316628508_Persistence_images_A_stable_vector_representation_of_persistent_homology","314741236_Graph_induced_complex_on_point_data","308805632_A_stable_multi-scale_kernel_for_topological_machine_learning","301439567_Local_persistent_homology_based_distance_between_maps","290181591_Persistence_Theory_From_Quiver_Representations_to_Data_Analysis","281766106_Statistical_topological_data_analysis_using_persistence_landscapes","279633409_Statistical_Inference_using_the_Morse-Smale_Complex","279232953_Probabilistic_Frechet_means_for_time_varying_persistence_diagrams","280953442_Stable_Topological_Signatures_for_Points_on_3D_Shapes","278798108_Persistence-Based_Structural_Recognition","277897918_Nudged_elastic_band_in_topological_data_analysis"]}
