{"id":"262170244_Ontology_based_data_mining_a_contribution_to_business_intelligence","abstract":"Marketing departments handles with a great volume of data which are normally task or marketing activity dependent. This requires the use of certain, and perhaps unique, specific knowledge background and framework. This article aims to introduce an almost unexplored research at marketing field: the ontological approach to the Database Marketing process. We propose a generic framework supported by ontologies and knowledge extraction from databases techniques. Therefore this paper has two purposes: to integrate ontological approach in Database Marketing and to create domain ontology with a knowledge base that will enhance the entire process at both levels: marketing and knowledge extraction techniques. Our work is based in the Action Research methodology. At the end of this research we use ontologies to pre-generalize the Database Marketing knowledge through a knowledge base.","authors":["Filipe Mota Pinto","Manuel Filipe Santos","Alzira Marques"],"meta":["March 2009","Conference: Proceedings of the 10th WSEAS international conference on Mathematics and computers in business and economics"],"references":["319395262_OWL_Web_Ontology_Language_Guide","302942570_A_Framework_for_Understanding_and_Classifying_Ontology_Applications","296592341_An_architecture_for_Database_Marketing_systems","289560248_The_reality_of_brands_Towards_an_ontology_of_marketing","264519987_The_Reality_of_Brands","244437488_A_Translation_Approach_to_Portable_Ontology_Specifications","240258879_Managing_interdependency_A_taxonomy_for_business-to-business_relationships","238750401_Applied_Social_Research_Methods_Series_Vol_34","238207964_Conceptual-ized_local_ontologies_specification_via_ctxml","235720353_A_Translational_Approach_to_Portable_Ontologies"]}
