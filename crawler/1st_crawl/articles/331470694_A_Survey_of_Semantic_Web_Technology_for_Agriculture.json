{"id":"331470694_A_Survey_of_Semantic_Web_Technology_for_Agriculture","abstract":"Semantic web technologies have become a popular technique to apply meaning to unstructured data. They have been infrequently applied to problems within the agricultural domain when compared to complementary domains. Despite this lack of application, agriculture has a large number of semantic resources that have been developed by large NGOs such as the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). This survey is intended to motivate further research in the application of semantic web technologies for agricultural problems, by making available a self contained reference that provides: a comprehensive review of preexisting semantic resources and their construction methods, data interchange standards, as well as a survey of the current applications of semantic web technologies.","authors":["Brett M Drury","Robson Fernandes","Maria fernanda Moura","Alneu de Andrade Lopes"],"meta":["March 2019Information Processing in Agriculture 6(4)","DOI:10.1016/j.inpa.2019.02.001","Project: Induction of Topic-Based Bayesian Networks from text for the prediction of sugar cane yields,"],"references":["324362218_LusTRE_a_framework_of_linked_environmental_thesauri_for_metadata_management","321416041_A_New_Framework_for_Collaborative_Ontology_Construction_for_an_Agricultural_Domain_from_Heterogeneous_Information_Resources","315198230_Development_of_GCP_Ontology_for_Sharing_Crop_Information","311920412_Digital_Knowledge_Ecosystem_for_Achieving_Sustainable_Agriculture_Production_A_Case_Study_from_Sri_Lanka","306914576_Adaptive_Ontology_Construction_Method_for_Crop_Pest_Management","320692646_Change_prediction_approach_and_application_effect_for_citrus_fertilization_and_irrigation_intelligent_decision_support_system","318230064_Design_Approaches_Emerging_in_Developing_an_Agricultural_Ontology_for_Sri_Lankan_Farmers","318053346_A_generic_ontological_network_for_Agri-food_experiment_integration_-_Application_to_viticulture_and_winemaking","312772370_Cultivation_Planning_Application_to_Enhance_Decision_Making_among_Sri_Lankan_Farmers","309706428_Ontology_for_Alleviating_Poverty_among_Farmers_in_Nigeria"]}
