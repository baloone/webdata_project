{"id":"220599040_Sketch_recognition_by_fusion_of_temporal_and_image-based_features","abstract":"The increasing availability of pen-based hardware has recently resulted in a parallel growth in sketch-based user interfaces. Sketch-based user interfaces aim to combine the expressive power of free-hand sketching with the processing power of computers. Most sketch-based systems require intelligent ink processing capabilities, which makes the development of robust sketch recognition algorithms a primary concern in the field. So far, the research in sketch recognition has produced various independent approaches to recognition, each of which uses a particular kind of information (e.g., geometric and spatial constraints, image-based features, temporal stroke-ordering patterns). These methods were designed in isolation as stand-alone algorithms, and there has been little work treating various recognition methods as alternative sources of information that can be combined to increase sketch recognition accuracy. In this paper, we focus on two such methods and fuse an image-based method with a time-based method in an attempt to combine the knowledge of how objects look (image data) with the knowledge of how they are drawn (temporal data). In the course of combining spatial and temporal information, we also introduce a mathematically well founded fusion method for combining recognizers. Our combination method can be used for isolated sketch recognition as well as full diagram recognition. Our evaluation with two databases shows that fusing image-based and temporal features yields higher recognition rates. These results are the first to confirm the complementary nature of image-based and temporal recognition methods for full sketch recognition, which has long been suggested, but never supported by data.","authors":["Relja Arandjelovic","Tevfik Metin Sezgin"],"meta":["June 2011Pattern Recognition 44(6):1225-1234","DOI:10.1016/j.patcog.2010.11.006","SourceDBLP"],"references":["267370603_Hidden_Markov_Model_Symbol_Recognition_for_Sketch-Based_Interfaces","251735770_A_Novel_Approach_to_On-Line_Handwriting_Recognition_Based_on_Bidirectional_Long_Short-Term_Memory_Networks","229014697_HMM-Based_On-Line_Recognition_of_Handwritten_Whiteboard_Notes","228967472_Generic_and_HMM_based_approaches_to_freehand_sketch_recognition","228952447_Spatial_Recognition_and_Grouping_of_Text_and_Graphics","228855935_An_image-based_trainable_symbol_recognizer_for_sketch-based_interfaces","228776073_Statistical_visual_language_models_for_ink_parsing","228398968_A_Compact_On-line_and_Off-line_Combined_Recognizer","225155325_Combining_diverse_systems_for_handwritten_text_line_recognition","224737607_Maximum_mutual_information_estimation_of_hidden_Markov_parameters_for_speech_recognition","222232867_An_image-based_trainable_symbol_recognizer_for_hand-drawn_sketches","221607832_HMM-Based_Efficient_Sketch_Recognition_1","221474887_Recognizing_Interspersed_sketches_quickly","220772344_A_Combinatorial_Approach_to_Multi-Domain_Sketch_Recognition","220499623_Estimating_Support_of_a_High-Dimensional_Distribution","7864710_An_integration_of_online_and_pseudo-online_information_for_cursive_word_recognition","4288391_An_Incremental_On-line_Parsing_Algorithm_for_Recognizing_Sketching_Diagrams","307881957_LIBSVM_A_library_for_support_vector_machines","246785286_Maximum_mutual_information_estimation_of_Hidden_Markov_model_parameters_for_speech_recognition","243763580_The_Nature_Of_Statistical_Learning_Theory","239546749_Statistical_Learning_Theory","238207656_Constellation_Models_for_Sketch_Recognition","228715647_LIBSVM_A_library_for_support_vector_machines","228630776_A_graphical_model_for_simultaneous_partitioning_and_labeling","225706852_Multiple_classifier_decision_combination_strategies_for_character_recognition_A_review","225555946_A_note_on_Platt's_probabilistic_outputs_for_support_vector_machines","223160224_LADDER_a_sketching_language_for_user_interface_developers","222826925_On-line_hand-drawn_electric_circuit_diagram_recognition_using_2D_dynamic_programming","222667964_Combining_geometry_and_domain_knowledge_to_interpret_hand-drawn_diagrams","222560509_Iconic_and_multi-stroke_gesture_recognition","222505116_Combining_statistical_and_structural_approaches_for_handwritten_character_description","222399004_Eager_interpretation_of_on-line_hand-drawn_structured_documents_The_DALI_methodology","222363290_Sketch_recognition_in_interspersed_drawings_using_time-based_graphical_models","222223369_Combining_diverse_on-line_and_off-line_systems_for_handwritten_text_line_recognition","222149418_Multimodal_Human_Computer_Interaction_A_Survey","221103955_Collaboration_Between_Statistical_and_Structural_Approaches_for_Old_Handwritten_Characters_Recognition","220877273_SketchREAD_a_multi-domain_sketch_recognition_engine","220853044_Sketch_Interpretation_and_Refinement_Using_Statistical_Models","220720539_Specifying_gestures_by_example","220694713_Statistical_Learning_Theory","220691539_Fundamentals_of_Speech_Recognition","220550822_Adaptive_binary_tree_for_fast_SVM_multiclass_classification","44024125_Combining_representations_for_improved_sketch_recognition","38000868_Envisioning_sketch_recognition_a_local_feature_based_approach_to_recognizing_informal_sketches","7305066_Data_drive_image_models_through_continuous_joint_alignment","4325768_Properties_of_Real-World_Digital_Logic_Diagrams","4184808_HMM-based_on-line_multi-stroke_sketch_recognition","4156429_Diagram_Structure_Recognition_by_Bayesian_Conditional_Random_Fields","4090160_Sketched_symbol_recognition_using_Zernike_moments","3916908_Online_recognition_of_sketched_electrical_diagrams","3114044_Methods_of_combining_multiple_classifiers_and_their_applications_to_handwriting_recognition","2528210_Shape_Matching_and_Object_Recognition_Using_Shape_Contexts","3817341_Hybrid_pen-input_character_recognition_system_based_on_integration_of_online-offline_recognition","3192827_On_Combining_Classifiers","2984124_A_Tutorial_on_Hidden_Markov_Models_and_Selected_Applications_on_Speech_Recognition"]}
