{"id":"264276560_Douglas-Rachford_Splitting_Complexity_Estimates_and_Accelerated_Variants","abstract":"We propose a new approach for analyzing convergence of the Douglas-Rachford\nsplitting method for solving convex composite optimization problems. The\napproach is based on a continuously differentiable function, the\nDouglas-Rachford Envelope (DRE), whose stationary points correspond to the\nsolutions of the original (possibly nonsmooth) problem. The Douglas-Rachford\nsplitting method is shown to be equivalent to a scaled gradient method on the\nDRE, and so results from smooth unconstrained optimization are employed to\nanalyze its convergence and optimally choose parameter {\\gamma} and to derive\nan accelerated variant of Douglas-Rachford splitting.","authors":["Panagiotis Patrinos","Lorenzo Stella","Alberto Bemporad"],"meta":["July 2014","DOI:10.1109/CDC.2014.7040049","SourcearXiv"],"references":["265360216_On_the_Global_and_Linear_Convergence_of_the_Generalized_Alternating_Direction_Method_of_Multipliers","264123192_Convergence_rates_of_relaxed_Peaceman-Rachford_and_ADMM_under_regularity_assumptions","263048124_Convex_Analysis_and_Monotone_Operator_Theory_in_Hilbert_Space","313157156_Fast_alternating_direction_optimization_methods","312453300_Proximal_algorithms","304533564_Applications_of_the_method_of_multipliers_to_variational_inequalities","285677677_Augmented_Lagrangian_Methods_Applications_to_the_Numerical_Solution_of_Boundary-Value_Problems","271549277_Proximal_Newton_methods_for_convex_composite_optimization","267430930_Convex_optimization_theory","265201153_Fast_Alternating_Direction_Optimization_Methods"]}
