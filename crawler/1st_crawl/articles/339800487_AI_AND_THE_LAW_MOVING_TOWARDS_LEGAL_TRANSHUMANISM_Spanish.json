{"id":"339800487_AI_AND_THE_LAW_MOVING_TOWARDS_LEGAL_TRANSHUMANISM_Spanish","abstract":"This article identifies some conditions that allow us to affirm the existence of the concept of Legal Transhumanism, due to evidence of interconnection between Law and Artificial Intelligence (AI), as a tool that allows amplifying the performance of jurists. Likewise, it outlines a rational interpretation and application of the concept. To achieve this, firstly, the concepts of AI and Transhumanism are critically explored, seeking to extract from their postulates the advances for the validity of the concept. Secondly, its objectives are defined and some of the technical limits that exist in computer science are described in order to highlight the restrictions of Legal Transhumanism and to demystify the existing fears around AI as it applies to the law.","authors":["Philippe Prince Tritto"],"meta":["February 2020","Project: Exploring the Digital Transformation of Law"],"references":["304543286_Sistema_juridico_principios_juridicos_y_razon_practica","233820788_AI_The_Tumultuous_History_of_the_Search_for_Artificial_Intelligence","318284884_The_Future_of_the_Professions_How_Technology_Will_Transform_the_Work_of_Human_Experts","311708489_An_Introduction_to_Cybernetics","272160113_Minds_Brains_and_Programs","221591101_The_Complexity_of_Theorem-Proving_Procedures","37713593_The_Case_Against_Perfection_Ethics_in_the_Age_of_Genetic_Engineering","2837971_Transhumanist_Values"]}
