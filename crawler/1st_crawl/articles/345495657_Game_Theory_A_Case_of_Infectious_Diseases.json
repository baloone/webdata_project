{"id":"345495657_Game_Theory_A_Case_of_Infectious_Diseases","abstract":"Game theory is a mathematical model which deals with interactions between various entities by analyzing the strategies and choices. In today's world, Game Theory is being extensively used in fields like computer science, economics, sociology, political science, and so on, due to its versatile nature and applications in numerous conflicts and problems. The application of game theory has been extended to real life problems also due to its versatility and robustness. In this research, various game theory methodologies applied during pandemic was reviewed. Various aspects of these methodologies were highlighted such as methods applied, description, expected result and limitation. This research will act as a reliable and efficient way of understanding the concept of game theory and its application in combating infectious diseases, analyze and eventually understand different strategic scenarios. The main importance of game theory is to formulate the alternative strategy to compete with one another and in the same sense it is an essential tool for decision making process according to fluctuations in relevant contents. These reviewed methodologies would be further categorized into prevent, control or both based on the application they favour most.","authors":["Yinka Adekunle","Dr. Seun Ebiesuwa","Onome Blaise Ohwo"],"meta":["July 2020International Journal of Scientific Research in Computer Science Engineering and Information Technology 6(4):202-213","DOI:10.32628/CSEIT20647"],"references":["340015274_Based_on_mathematical_epidemiology_and_evolutionary_game_theory_which_is_more_effective_Quarantine_or_isolation_policy","339995962_Epidemiology_causes_clinical_manifestation_and_diagnosis_prevention_and_control_of_coronavirus_disease_COVID-19_during_the_early_outbreak_period_A_scoping_review","336250184_Game_theory_of_vaccination_and_depopulation_for_managing_livestock_diseases_and_zoonoses_on_small-scale_farms","334066314_Psychological_game_theory_in_public_choice","333438352_The_behavioral_model_and_game_theory","327599546_Strategic_decision_making_about_travel_during_disease_outbreaks_A_game_theoretical_approach","319421476_Prevention_of_treatable_infectious_diseases_A_game-theoretic_approach","301876630_Disease_dynamics_in_a_stochastic_network_game_A_little_empathy_goes_a_long_way_in_averting_outbreaks","326903669_An_Overview_of_Game_Theory_and_Some_Applications","322880722_Game_Theory_for_Computer_Games_Design","278692441_An_Application_of_Game_Theory_for_the_Selection_of_Traffic_Routing_Method_in_Interconnected_NGN","259752225_Methodology_in_Biological_Game_Theory","258083744_Game_Theory_with_Translucent_Players","234131819_Game_theory_and_plant_ecology","227991551_Algorithmic_Game_Theory_and_Applications"]}
