{"id":"243096167_Optimal_a_Posteriori_Parameter_Choice_for_Tikhonov_Regularization_for_Solving_Nonlinear_Ill-Posed_Problems","abstract":"The authors propose an a-posteriori strategy for choosing the regularization parameter in Tikhonov regularization for solving nonlinear ill-posed problems and show that under certain conditions, the convergence rate obtained with this strategy is optimal. As a by-product, a new stability estimate for the regularized solutions is given which applies to a class of parameter identification problems. The authors compare the parameter choice strategy with Morozov's Discrepancy Principle. Finally, numerical results are presented.","authors":["O. Scherzer","H. W. Engl","K.
