{"id":"303789186_Multiparty_asynchronous_session_types","abstract":"Communication is a central elements in software development. As a potential typed foundation for structured communication-centered programming, session types have been studied over the past decade for a wide range of process calculi and programming languages, focusing on binary (two-party) sessions. This work extends the foregoing theories of binary session types to multiparty, asynchronous sessions, which often arise in practical communication-centered applications. Presented as a typed calculus for mobile processes, the theory introduces a new notion of types in which interactions involving multiple peers are directly abstracted as a global scenario. Global types retain the friendly type syntax of binary session types while specifying dependencies and capturing complex causal chains of multiparty asynchronous interactions. A global type plays the role ofashared agreement among communication peers and isusedas a basis of efficient type-checking through its projection onto individual peers. The fundamental properties of the session type discipline, such as communication safety, progress, and session fidelity, are established for general n-party asynchronous interactions.","authors":["K.
