{"id":"331003394_De-anonymizing_Scale-Free_Social_Networks_by_Using_Spectrum_Partitioning_Method","abstract":"Social network data is widely shared, forwarded and published to third parties, which led to the risks of privacy disclosure. Even thought the network provider always perturbs the data before publishing it, attackers can still recover anonymous data according to the collected auxiliary information. In this paper, we transform the problem of de-anonymization into node matching problem in graph, and the de-anonymization method can reduce the number of nodes to be matched at each time. In addition, we use spectrum partitioning method to divide the social graph into disjoint subgraphs, and it can effectively be applied to large-scale social networks and executed in parallel by using multiple processors. Through the analysis of the influence of power-law distribution on de-anonymization, we synthetically consider the structural and personal information of users which made the feature information of the user more practical.","authors":["Chloe Sun","Jiguo Yu","Honglu Jiang","Yixian Chen"],"meta":["February 2019Procedia Computer Science 147:441-445","DOI:10.1016/j.procs.2019.01.262"],"references":["324516390_SA_Framework_based_De-anonymization_of_Social_Networks","320726911_Social_Network_De-anonymization_More_Adversarial_Knowledge_More_Users_Re-Identified","304668936_De-anonymizing_Social_Networks_and_Inferring_Private_Attributes_Using_Knowledge_Graphs","320047991_De-Anonymizing_Social_Networks_With_Random_Forest_Classifier","311337422_Graph_Data_Anonymization_De-Anonymization_Attacks_and_De-Anonymizability_Quantification_A_Survey","304007758_L-diversity_Privacy_beyond_k-AnonymityJ","303437816_Differential_privacy","290962656_Structure_Based_Data_De-Anonymization_of_Social_Networks_and_Mobility_Traces","284683939_Structural_Data_De-anonymization","284332229_k-Anonymity_A_Model_for_Protecting_Privacy","234168931_Complexity_of_Social_Network_Anonymization","262212418_Deanonymizing_mobility_traces_Using_social_networks_as_a_side-channel","248484602_Node_Centrality_in_Weighted_Networks_Generalizing_Degree_and_Shortest_Paths","220473536_Resisting_Structural_Re-identification_in_Anonymized_Social_Networks","200110616_Wherefore_art_thou_r3579x_Anonymized_social_networks_hidden_patterns_and_structural_steganography"]}
