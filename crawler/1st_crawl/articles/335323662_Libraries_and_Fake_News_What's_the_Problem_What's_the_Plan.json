{"id":"335323662_Libraries_and_Fake_News_What's_the_Problem_What's_the_Plan","abstract":"This article surveys the library and information science (LIS) response to the problems of fake news and misinformation from the 2016 U.S. presidential election to the end of 2018, focusing on how librarians and other information professionals in the United States have articulated the problems and the paths forward for combating them. Additionally, the article attempts to locate the LIS response in a larger interdisciplinary misinformation research program, provide commentary on the response in view of that research program, and lay out both a possible research agenda for the field and practical next steps for educators ahead of the 2020 election.\n\nFull text available: https://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/comminfolit/vol13/iss1/7","authors":["M.
