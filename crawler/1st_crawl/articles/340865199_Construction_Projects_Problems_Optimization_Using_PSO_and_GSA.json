{"id":"340865199_Construction_Projects_Problems_Optimization_Using_PSO_and_GSA","abstract":"Construction projects are a combination of high complicated procedures that rarely go with the plan. The greatest dangers projects are the construction since it linked with an extraordinary amount of ambiguity and threat and that because of the business activities nature, procedures, and the outside surroundings. This paper investigates the problems during the pre-construction phase and the optimal solution for this problem by using to algorithm, partial swarm and Gravitational search algorithm. The results show that the construction problems have a severe effect on both time and cost and these problems must be treated immediately and this requires sophisticated techniques by using computer science. GSA and PSO are both used and show excellent results in solving these problems, the GSA algorithm shows better results in both the velocity is taken to find the solutions and in the accuracy. PSO is still a good technique in finding the solution and their future recommendation in making an expert system to find the solution more than one project and their interdependency.","authors":["Naji Mutar Sahib","Abtehaj Hussein","Suha Faleh",".
