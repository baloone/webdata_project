{"id":"351820621_Computational_theory_of_formal_languages_on_picture_languages","abstract":"Formal language theory is defined as computational theory of languages. It provides theoretical aspects of computer science and helps to determine infinite languages in finite number of ways. So, algorithms can be constructed for relevant problems. Then again, decide either a string is existed in language or not under the language. A formal language is an abstraction of the common features of programming languages. Furthermore, a formal language comprises a set of symbols and then some rules of creation by way of these symbols may be combined into entities which is called as sentences. Additionally, a formal language is the grouping the strings accepted by the rules of construction. Even though, many of the formal languages easier than programming languages that they have lot of similar essential properties. It is a great deal to study about programming languages from formal languages. Mathematical structure of languages and its basic properties are the natural languages. It is an integrative area of science.","authors":["Ramya G"],"meta":["May 2021Materials Today: Proceedings","DOI:10.1016/j.matpr.2021.05.072"],"references":["326642861_Generating_various_kolam_patterns_using_new_kolam_picture_grammar","309767503_Survey_on_various_Classes_of_Picture_Languages","263886792_Local_and_recognizable_hexagonal_picture_languages","237442288_Fundamental_Study_on_Design_System_of_Kolam_Pattern","228539856_Random_Context_Picture_Grammars_The_State_of_the_Art","333446991_Implementation_of_collage_grammar_in_kolam_grammar_to_generate_Kolam_patterns_in_picture_languages","329081464_Octagonal_picture_languages","242622982_Abstract_families_of_matrices_and_picture_languages","225122525_Collage_grammars","222584378_Picture_languages_with_array_rewriting_rules","220154441_Picture_languages_Tiling_systems_versus_tile_rewriting_grammars","2827537_On_Piecewise_Testable_Starfree_and_Recognizable_Picture_Languages","2282279_Collage-One_A_system_for_evaluation_and_visualization_of_collage_grammars","220359891_Recognizable_Picture_Languages","37915735_Collages_and_Patterns_Generated_by_Hyperedge_Replacement"]}
