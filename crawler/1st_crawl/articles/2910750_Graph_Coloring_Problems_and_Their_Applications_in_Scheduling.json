{"id":"2910750_Graph_Coloring_Problems_and_Their_Applications_in_Scheduling","abstract":"Graph coloring and its generalizations are useful tools in modeling a wide variety of scheduling and assignment problems. In this paper we review several variants of graph coloring, such as precoloring extension, list coloring, multicoloring, minimum sum coloring, and discuss their applications in scheduling.","authors":["D Aniel Marx"],"meta":["October 2003Periodica Polytechnica, Electrical Engineering 48(1)"],"references":["221475467_An_Introduction_to_Chromatic_Sums","220568644_Complexity_of_Scheduling_Multiprocessor_Tasks_with_Prespecified_Processor_Allocations","231940360_Precoloring_Extension_III_Classes_of_Perfect_Graphs","229817483_Extending_an_edge-coloring","223102126_Sum_Multicoloring_of_Graphs","222916981_On_Chromatic_Sums_and_Distributed_Resource_Allocation","222778329_Precoloring_extension_I_Interval_graphs","222556252_Tools_for_Multicoloring_with_Applications_to_Planar_Graphs_and_Partial_k-Trees","222485668_Complexity_of_Scheduling_Multiprocessor_Tasks_with_Prespecified_Processor_Allocations","221462721_A_2726-Approximation_Algorithm_for_the_Chromatic_Sum_Coloring_of_Bipartite_Graphs","220617300_The_NP-Completeness_of_Edge-Coloring","220616388_Scheduling_File_Transfers","220532728_On_the_11_Edge-Coloring_of_Multigraphs","220249088_Multicoloring_Trees","220223818_On_Coloring_Unit_Disk_Graphs","220114101_List_Edge_Multicoloring_in_Graphs_with_Few_Cycles","220112789_Edge-chromatic_sum_of_trees_and_bounded_cyclicity_graphs","2826955_Precoloring_Extension_Ii_Graphs_Classes_Related_To_Bipartite_Graphs","2292770_Generalized_Coloring_for_Tree-Like_Graphs","2260676_Static_Frequency_Assignment_in_Cellular_Networks"]}
