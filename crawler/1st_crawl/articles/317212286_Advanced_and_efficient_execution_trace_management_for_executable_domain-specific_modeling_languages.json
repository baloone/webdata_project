{"id":"317212286_Advanced_and_efficient_execution_trace_management_for_executable_domain-specific_modeling_languages","abstract":"Executable Domain-Specific Modeling Languages (xDSMLs) enable the application of early dynamic verification and validation (V&V) techniques for behavioral models. At the core of such techniques, execution traces are used to represent the evolution of models during their execution. In order to construct execution traces for any xDSML, generic trace metamodels can be used. Yet, regarding trace manipulations, generic trace metamodels lack efficiency in time because of their sequential structure, efficiency in memory because they capture superfluous data, and usability because of their conceptual gap with the considered xDSML. Our contribution is a novel generative approach that defines a multidimensional and domain-specific trace metamodel enabling the construction and manipulation of execution traces for models conforming to a given xDSML. Efficiency in time is improved by providing a variety of navigation paths within traces, while usability and memory are improved by narrowing the scope of trace metamodels to fit the considered xDSML. We evaluated our approach by generating a trace metamodel for fUML and using it for semantic differencing, which is an important V&V technique in the realm of model evolution. Results show a significant performance improvement and simplification of the semantic differencing rules as compared to the usage of a generic trace metamodel.","authors":["Erwan Bousse","Tanja Mayerhofer","Benoit Combemale","Benoit Baudry"],"meta":["February 2019Software and Systems Modeling 18(5):1-37","DOI:10.1007/s10270-017-0598-5"],"references":["315737187_ProMoBox_A_Framework_for_Generating_Domain-Specific_Property_Languages","280736521_A_Generative_Approach_to_Define_Rich_Domain-Specific_Trace_Metamodels","280736283_Towards_Scalable_Multidimensional_Execution_Traces_for_xDSMLs","313135061_Specification_of_graph_translators_with_triple_graph_grammars","301465584_Agile_programming_with_executable_models_an_open-source_standards-based_eclipse_environment","300479167_Reverse_Engineering_of_Model_Transformations_for_Reusability","300013646_Semantic_Model_Differencing_Utilizing_Behavioral_Semantics_Specifications","300013578_Formalizing_Execution_Semantics_of_UML_Profiles_with_fUML_Models","291570406_Towards_Efficient_and_Scalabale_Omniscient_Debugging_for_Model_Transformations","288582152_From_application_models_to_filmstrip_models_An_approach_to_automatic_va_lidation_of_model_dynamics"]}
