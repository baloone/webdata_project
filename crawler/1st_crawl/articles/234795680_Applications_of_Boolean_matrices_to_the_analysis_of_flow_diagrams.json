{"id":"234795680_Applications_of_Boolean_matrices_to_the_analysis_of_flow_diagrams","abstract":"Any serious attempt at automatic programming of large-scale digital computing machines must provide for some sort of analysis of program structure. Questions concerning order of operations, location and disposition of transfers, identification of subroutines, internal consistency, redundancy and equivalence, all involve a knowledge of the structure of the program under study, and must be handled effectively by any automatic programming system.","authors":["Reese T.
