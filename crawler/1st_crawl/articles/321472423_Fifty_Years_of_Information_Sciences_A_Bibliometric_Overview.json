{"id":"321472423_Fifty_Years_of_Information_Sciences_A_Bibliometric_Overview","abstract":"Information Sciences is a leading international journal in computer science launched in 1968, so becoming fifty years old in 2018. In order to celebrate its anniversary, this study presents a bibliometric overview of the leading publication and citation trends occurring in the journal. The aim of the work is to identify the most relevant authors, institutions, countries, and analyze their evolution through time. The paper uses the Web of Science Core Collection in order to search for the bibliographic information. Our study also develops a graphical mapping of the bibliometric material by using the visualization of similarities (VOS) viewer. With this software, the work analyzes bibliographic coupling, citation and co-citation analysis, co-authorship, and co-occurrence of keywords. The results underline the significant growth of the journal through time and its international diversity having publications from countries all over the world.","authors":["Jose M.
