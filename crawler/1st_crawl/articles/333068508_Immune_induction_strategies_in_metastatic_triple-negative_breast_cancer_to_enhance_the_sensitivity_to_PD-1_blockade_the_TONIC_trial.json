Preclinical research has suggested immunomodulatory properties for chemotherapy and irradiation6–13. In the first stage of this adaptive, non-comparative phase 2 trial, 67 patients with metastatic TNBC were randomized to nivolumab (1) without induction or with 2-week low-dose induction, or with (2) irradiation (3 × 8 Gy), (3) cyclophosphamide, (4) cisplatin or (5) doxorubicin, all followed by nivolumab. In the overall cohort, the objective response rate (ORR; iRECIST¹⁴) was 20%. The majority of responses were observed in the cisplatin (ORR 23%) and doxorubicin (ORR 35%) cohorts. After doxorubicin and cisplatin induction, we detected an upregulation of immune-related genes involved in PD-1–PD-L1 (programmed death ligand 1) and T cell cytotoxicity pathways. This was further supported by enrichment among upregulated genes related to inflammation, JAK–STAT and TNF-α signaling after doxorubicin. Together, the clinical and translational data of this study indicate that short-term doxorubicin and cisplatin may induce a more favorable tumor microenvironment and increase the likelihood of response to PD-1 blockade in TNBC. These data warrant confirmation in TNBC and exploration of induction treatments prior to PD-1 blockade in other cancer types.","authors":["Leonie Voorwerk","Maarten Slagter","Hugo M Horlings","Karolina Sikorska"],"meta":["June 2019Nature Medicine 25(6)","DOI:10.1038/s41591-019-0432-4"],"references":["330367929_Tumor_mutational_load_predicts_survival_after_immunotherapy_across_multiple_cancer_types","329218193_Title_Pembrolizumab_Monotherapy_for_Previously_Untreated_PD-L1-Positive_Metastatic_Triple-Negative_Breast_Cancer_Cohort_B_of_the_Phase_2_KEYNOTE-086_Study","329218191_Pembrolizumab_Monotherapy_for_Previously_Treated_Metastatic_Triple-Negative_Breast_Cancer_Cohort_A_of_the_Phase_2_KEYNOTE-086_Study","328147458_Neoadjuvant_versus_adjuvant_ipilimumab_plus_nivolumab_in_macroscopic_stage_III_melanoma","327632191_RUSSCO-RSP_comparative_study_of_immunohistochemistry_diagnostic_assays_for_PD-L1_expression_in_urothelial_bladder_cancer","324556078_Neoadjuvant_PD-1_Blockade_in_Resectable_Lung_Cancer","328435378_Atezolizumab_Plus_nab-Paclitaxel_in_the_Treatment_of_Metastatic_Triple-Negative_Breast_Cancer_With_2-Year_Survival_Follow-up_A_Phase_1b_Clinical_Trial","328412034_Atezolizumab_and_Nab-Paclitaxel_in_Advanced_Triple-Negative_Breast_Cancer","327736997_Long-term_Clinical_Outcomes_and_Biomarker_Analyses_of_Atezolizumab_Therapy_for_Patients_With_Metastatic_Triple-Negative_Breast_Cancer_A_Phase_1_Study","327453349_Randomized_phase_II_neoadjuvant_study_GeparNuevo_to_investigate_the_addition_of_durvalumab_to_a_taxane-anthracycline_containing_chemotherapy_in_triple_negative_breast_cancer_TNBC","322323792_Diverse_genetic-driven_immune_landscapes_dictate_tumor_progression_through_distinct_mechanisms","320580985_Avelumab_an_anti-PD-L1_antibody_in_patients_with_locally_advanced_or_metastatic_breast_cancer_a_phase_1b_JAVELIN_Solid_Tumor_study","323404885_Development_of_gene_expression_signatures_characterizing_the_tumor-immune_interaction","323207508_Abstract_P2-09-13_Molecular_characterization_of_tumors_from_metastatic_TNBC_patients_treated_with_atezolizumab_atezo","320231864_NetMHCpan-40_Improved_Peptide-MHC_Class_I_Interaction_Predictions_Integrating_Eluted_Ligand_and_Peptide_Binding_Affinity_Data"]}
