The Remote Presence Robot (RPR), the RP-7i (FDA- cleared) provided by InTouch Health was used in the study. Patients and their relatives were informed that the physician would appear through a screen on top of a robotic device, as part of their clinical care. Stroke patients admitted through the emergency department, and their relatives, as well as healthcare providers completed a self-administered satisfaction questionnaire following the telestroke consultation sessions.\nFifty participants completed the questionnaire. Most subjects agreed that the remote consultant interview was useful and that the audiovisual component of the intervention was of high quality; 98% agreed that they did not feel shy or embarrassed during the remote interview, were able to understand the instruction of the consultant, and recommended its use in stroke management. Furthermore, 92% agreed or strongly agreed that the use of this technology can efficiently replace the physical presence of a neurologist.\nResults suggest that the use of telestroke medicine is culturally acceptable among stroke patients and their families in Saudi Arabia and favorably received by healthcare providers.","authors":["Ali M Al-Khathaami","Saeed Mastour Alshahrani","Suleiman Kojan","Mohammed Al Jumah"],"meta":["January 2015Neurosciences 20(1):27-30","SourcePubMed"],"references":["256190858_The_use_of_remote_presence_for_health_care_delivery_in_a_northern_Inuit_community_A_feasibility_study","229324151_Deaths_Final_Data_for_2008","44797845_Attitudes_and_Reactions_to_a_Healthcare_Robot","5940867_Shortening_time_to_stroke_treatment_using_ambulance_telemedicine_TeleBAT","309414692_Deaths_Final_Data_for_2012","239948047_Time_to_Treatment_With_Intravenous_Tissue_Plasminogen_Activator_and_Outcome_From_Acute_Ischemic_Stroke","230892804_The_future_of_stroke_thrombolysis","51797082_Barriers_to_Telemedicine_Survey_of_Current_Users_in_Acute_Care_Units","51714430_Case_volumes_of_intra-arterial_and_intravenous_treatment_of_ischemic_stroke_in_the_USA","49727886_The_Status_of_Acute_Stroke_Care_in_Saudi_Arabia_An_Urgent_Call_for_Action","24409840_A_Review_of_the_Evidence_for_the_Use_of_Telemedicine_Within_Stroke_Systems_of_Care_A_Scientific_Statement_From_the_American_Heart_AssociationAmerican_Stroke_Association","23640188_Endovascular_Therapy_for_Acute_Ischemic_Stroke","7603990_The_Use_of_Telemedicine_in_Combination_With_a_New_Stroke-Code-Box_Significantly_Increases_t-PA_Use_in_Rural_Communities","7289533_Telestroke_Extending_stroke_expertise_into_underserved_areas","7020500_Comparison_of_Tissue_Plasminogen_Activator_Administration_Management_Between_Telestroke_Network_Hospitals_and_Academic_Stroke_Centers_The_Telemedical_Pilot_Project_for_Integrative_Stroke_Care_in_Bavar","6874055_Effects_of_the_implementation_of_a_telemedical_stroke_network_the_Telemedic_Pilot_Project_for_Integrative_Stroke_Care_TEMPiS_in_Bavaria_Germany"]}
