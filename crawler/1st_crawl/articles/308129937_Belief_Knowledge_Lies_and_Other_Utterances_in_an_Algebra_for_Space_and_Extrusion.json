Constraint systems are often represented as lattices: their elements, called constraints, represent partial information and their order corresponds to entailment. Recently a notion of n-agent spatial cs was introduced to represent information in concurrent constraint programs for spatially distributed multi-agent systems. From a computational point of view a spatial constraint system can be used to specify partial information holding in a given agent's space (local information). From an epistemic point of view a spatial cs can be used to specify information that a given agent considers true (beliefs). Spatial constraint systems, however, do not provide a mechanism for specifying the mobility of information/processes from one space to another. Information mobility is a fundamental aspect of concurrent systems.","authors":["Michell Guzman","Stefan Haar","Salim Perchy","Camilo Rueda"],"meta":["September 2016Journal of Logical and Algebraic Methods in Programming 86(1)","DOI:10.1016/j.jlamp.2016.09.001"],"references":["290402640_An_Algebraic_View_of_SpaceBelief_and_ExtrusionUtterance_for_ConcurrencyEpistemic_Logic","282188631_A_Secure_Non-monotonic_Soft_Concurrent_Constraint_Language","267465825_Spatial_and_Epistemic_Modalities_in_Constraint-Based_Process_Calculi","263663964_Dynamic_Spaces_in_Concurrent_Constraint_Programming","257666727_Dynamics_of_lying","228966378_Defining_knowledge_in_terms_of_belief_The_modal_logic_perspective","226922207_Counterfactuals_and_Updates_as_Inverse_Modalities","221602819_CC-Pi_A_Constraint-Based_Language_for_Specifying_Service_Level_Agreements","221570195_Deriving_Labels_and_Bisimilarity_for_Concurrent_Constraint_Programming","221176502_A_Logical_Account_of_Lying","220997945_Semantic_Foundations_of_Concurrent_Constraint_Programming","220997507_Abstract_Interpretation_A_Unified_Lattice_Model_for_Static_Analysis_of_Programs_by_Construction_or_Approximation_of_Fixpoints","220986974_A_Distributed_and_Probabilistic_Concurrent_Constraint_Programming_Language","220673104_A_Logical_View_Of_Concurrent_Constraint_Programming","51932629_A_Logic_with_Reverse_Modalities_for_History-preserving_Bisimulations","47757658_On_the_Logic_of_Lying","2349228_A_Hyperdoctrinal_View_of_Concurrent_Constraint_Programming","270956368_Mobile_Ambients","265367481_The_Algebra_of_Topology","256555153_Nondeterminism_and_infinite_computations_in_constraint_programming","227998801_Semantical_Analysis_of_Modal_Logic_I_Normal_Modal_Propositional_Calculi","227092273_Declarative_Diagnosis_of_Temporal_Concurrent_Constraint_Programs","222031104_A_spatial_logic_for_concurrency_Part_I","221443281_Psi-calculi_Mobile_Processes_Nominal_Data_and_Logic","220444734_Distributed_Concurrent_Constraint_Programming","220106553_Modelling_Multi-Agent_Systems_as_Synchronous_Concurrent_Constraint_Processes","49401646_Concurrent_constraint_programming_with_process_mobility","29614407_The_Expressivity_of_Universal_Timed_CCP_Undecidability_of_Monadic_FLTL_and_Closure_Operators_for_Security","2903373_Domain_Theory","2837969_A_Spatial_Logic_for_Concurrency_Part_II","2517937_An_Algebraic_Perspective_of_Constraint_Logic_Programming","2323472_Linear_Concurrent_Constraint_Programming_Operational_and_Phase_Semantics"]}
