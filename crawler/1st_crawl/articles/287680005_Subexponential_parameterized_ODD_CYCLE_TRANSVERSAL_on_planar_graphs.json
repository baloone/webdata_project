{"id":"287680005_Subexponential_parameterized_ODD_CYCLE_TRANSVERSAL_on_planar_graphs","abstract":"In the ODD CYCLE TRANSVERSAL (OCT) problem we are given a graph G on n vertices and an integer k, the objective is to determine whether there exists a vertex set O in G of size at most k such that G \\ O is bipartite. Reed, Smith and Vetta [Oper. Res. Lett., 2004] gave an algorithm for OCT with running time 3knO(1). Assuming the exponential time hypothesis of Impagliazzo, Paturi and Zane, the running time can not be improved to 2 o(k)nO(1). We show that OCT admits a randomized algorithm running in O(nO(1) + 2O(√klog k)n) time when the input graph is planar. As a byproduct we also obtain a linear time algorithm for OCT on planar graphs with running time O(2O(klogk)n) time. This improves over an algorithm of Fiorini et al. [Disc. Appl. Math., 2008].","authors":["D. Lokshtanov","Saket Saurabh","M.
