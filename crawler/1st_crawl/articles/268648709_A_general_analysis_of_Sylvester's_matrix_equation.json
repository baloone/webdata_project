{"id":"268648709_A_general_analysis_of_Sylvester's_matrix_equation","abstract":"This article is a sequel to that published in this journal by the present author in 1989. In the first article the case in which Sylvester's equation possesses a unique solution was examined. Here it is proposed to look at the general case; necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a solution are obtained and the general solution, if it exists, is also given.","authors":["A.J.B.
