{"id":"339511731_Media_studies_in_Russia_determination_of_scientific_status","abstract":"Journalism theory in Russia, in the era of the traditional mass media of print press and analogue broadcasts, was the main conceptual framework for media studies. The digital transformation of mass media indicates journalism theory cannot be applied to the new phenomena. The diversity of designations of media science in Russia shows the evident lack of consensus among academia on this issue, which is also reflected in a system of scientific classifiers. Today it is difficult to establish media studies as a consolidated academic field in modern Russia. The paper attempts to analyze the position of media studies in the scientific classification system in Russia and in fundamental academic institutions. The authors raise questions about the scientific status of media studies in the general field of humanities. The paper employs the frequency analysis method in the context of terms, concepts and designations from the National Electronic Library, as well as the systematization and classification of data from documents of Russian scientific organizations obtained from open sources.","authors":["Elena Vartanova","Anikina Maria","Denis Dunas","Gureeva Anna"],"meta":["February 2020Russian Journal of Communication 12(1):1-15","DOI:10.1080/19409419.2020.1729456"],"references":["289325299_Normative_Theories_of_the_Media_Journalism_in_Democratic_Societies","270339708_Citizens'_media_as_political_subjects_The_case_of_community_radio_in_Colombia","236657171_The_academic_identity_crisis_of_the_European_communication_researcher","349607799_The_Handbook_of_Journalism_Studies","339716481_Media_Studies_in_Russia_Defining_its_Academic_Status","334488224_The_Handbook_of_Journalism_Studies_Second_Edition","326703636_Media_theory_in_Russia_Current_wave_of_fermentation","324937048_The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions","324556533_Ferments_in_the_Field_Introductory_Reflections_on_the_Past_Present_and_Future_of_Communication_Studies","309351501_The_mediated_construction_of_reality","285559601_Ferment_in_the_Field_Notes_on_the_Evolution_of_Communication_Studies_and_its_Disciplinary_Nature","270184632_Russian_Media_Challenge","237571215_Understanding_New_Digital_MediaMedium_Theory_or_Complexity_Theory","233261105_Internationalizing_Media_Theory","229709012_Media_and_Communication_Studies_going_Global","229470332_The_Importance_of_Being_Critical-In_One's_Own_Fashion"]}
