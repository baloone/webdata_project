Ketotic cows are characterized by high blood concentrations of fatty acids and Î²-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), which display lipotoxicity. The aim of this study was to investigate changes in the hepatic GH-IGF-I axis in ketotic cows and to determine the effects of fatty acids and BHB on the GH-IGF-I axis in calf hepatocytes. Liver and blood samples were collected from healthy (n = 15) and clinically ketotic (n = 15) cows. Hepatocytes were isolated from calves and treated with various concentrations of GH, fatty acids, and BHB. The results showed that clinically ketotic cows displayed a high blood concentration of GH, a low blood concentration of IGF-I, and decreased hepatic GHR1A expression as well as impaired hepatic Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)-signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) signaling. In vitro, GH treatment induced activation of the JAK2-STAT5 pathway to increase the mRNA expression and secretion of IGF-I in calf hepatocytes. More importantly, treatment with fatty acids or BHB significantly inhibited GHR1A mRNA and JAK2 protein expression, as well as the STAT5 phosphorylation level and phospho-STAT5 nuclear translocation; these effects markedly reduced IGF1 mRNA expression and secretion in calf hepatocytes. In summary, these results indicate that high blood concentrations of fatty acids or BHB can impair the intrahepatic GH-mediated JAK2-STAT5 pathway and downregulate IGF-I expression and secretion in ketotic cows.","authors":["Xiliang Du","Yiwei Zhu","Zhicheng Peng","Yuanxu Cui"],"meta":["February 2018Journal of Dairy Science 101(4)","DOI:10.3168/jds.2017-13234"],"references":["319322576_Upregulation_of_miR-181a_impairs_hepatic_glucose_and_lipid_homeostasis","316073679_Isolation_and_cultivation_of_adult_primary_bovine_hepatocytes_from_abattoir_derived_liver","312135655_Acetoacetate_Induces_Hepatocytes_Apoptosis_by_the_ROS-Mediated_MAPKs_Pathway_in_Ketotic_Cows","304331719_Lipid_signaling_and_lipotoxicity_in_metabolic_inflammation_indications_for_metabolic_disease_pathogenesis_and_treatment","313960463_Hepatic_mRNA_expression_for_genes_related_to_somatotropic_axis_glucose_and_lipid_metabolisms_and_inflammatory_response_of_periparturient_dairy_cows_treated_with_recombinant_bovine_somatotropin","313571953_The_metabolic_consequences_of_stress_Targets_for_stress_and_priorities_of_nutrient_use","313506713_Adipocyte_JAK2_mediates_growth_hormone-induced_hepatic_insulin_resistance","309892448_A_comparison_of_serum_metabolic_and_production_profiles_of_dairy_cows_that_maintained_or_lost_body_condition_15_days_before_calving","308880901_Associations_of_high_and_low_milk_protein_concentrations_with_energy_allocation_milk_production_and_concentrations_of_blood_plasma_metabolites_and_hormones_in_Holstein-Friesian_cows","304814939_Environmental_estrogens_inhibit_mRNA_and_functional_expression_of_growth_hormone_receptors_as_well_as_growth_hormone_signaling_pathways_in_vitro_in_rainbow_trout_Oncorhynchus_mykiss"]}
