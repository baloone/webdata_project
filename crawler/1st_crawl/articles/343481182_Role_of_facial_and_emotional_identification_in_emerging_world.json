{"id":"343481182_Role_of_facial_and_emotional_identification_in_emerging_world","abstract":"In the world of technology emotion recognition is also a challenge in field computer science. gestures like body movement facial expression anything that conveys your feeling can be used to interact between human and computer. these are things which can be done by using few sensors. sensors have a very important role in finding a required input to give an accurate output for better functioning and also increases efficiency of the computer. this time there are many type detection like iris detection in fingerprint detection your facial expression detection and emotion detection to do these things you need to have a sensor which can sense and stimulate the process in a very few seconds to provide you the best of its within a few seconds. these things make the man machine an intelligent machine which helps us to teach social intelligence to machines. everyone knows computer science in growing and stretching their hands in every field so this is also a combination of computer science and electronics that are used for making such a type of device which can recognise your expressions. in this time it is very necessary to have this expression recognition because password is something which can be revealed and used by others might be hacked by the hackers but the facial expression during emotions used by others for unlocking the thing that is locked by your facial expression.","authors":["Jagdesha","Prabhu Prasad"],"meta":["January 2019","Project: research"],"references":["343179789_THE_EMERGING_ROLE_OF_ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE_IN_MODERN_SOCIETY","343111665_The_Supremacy_of_Artificial_intelligence_and_Neural_Networks"]}
