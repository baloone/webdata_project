{"id":"319383272_Convolutional_auto-encoder_for_image_denoising_of_ultra-low-dose_CT","abstract":"Objectives: The purpose of this study was to validate a patch-based image denoising method for ultra-low-dose CT images. Neural network with convolutional auto-encoder and pairs of standard-dose CT and ultra-low-dose CT image patches were used for image denoising. The performance of the proposed method was measured by using a chest phantom.\nMaterials and methods: Standard-dose and ultra-low-dose CT images of the chest phantom were acquired. The tube currents for standard-dose and ultra-low-dose CT were 300 and 10 mA, respectively. Ultra-low-dose CT images were denoised with our proposed method using neural network, large-scale nonlocal mean, and block-matching and 3D filtering. Five radiologists and three technologists assessed the denoised ultra-low-dose CT images visually and recorded their subjective impressions of streak artifacts, noise other than streak artifacts, visualization of pulmonary vessels, and overall image quality.\nResults: For the streak artifacts, noise other than streak artifacts, and visualization of pulmonary vessels, the results of our proposed method were statistically better than those of block-matching and 3D filtering (p-values < 0.05). On the other hand, the difference in the overall image quality between our proposed method and block-matching and 3D filtering was not statistically significant (p-value = 0.07272). The p-values obtained between our proposed method and large-scale nonlocal mean were all less than 0.05.\nConclusion: Neural network with convolutional auto-encoder could be trained using pairs of standard-dose and ultra-low-dose CT image patches. According to the visual assessment by radiologists and technologists, the performance of our proposed method was superior to that of large-scale nonlocal mean and block-matching and 3D filtering.","authors":["Mizuho Nishio","Chihiro Nagashima","Saori Hirabayashi","Akinori Ohnishi"],"meta":["August 2017Heliyon 3(8):e00393","DOI:10.1016/j.heliyon.2017.e00393"],"references":["308692568_Low-dose_CT_via_convolutional_neural_network","307891710_Application_of_the_homology_method_for_quantification_of_low-attenuation_lung_region_in_patients_with_and_without_COPD","305735726_Image_Prediction_for_Limited-angle_Tomography_via_Deep_Learning_with_Convolutional_Neural_Network","282471920_A_Novel_Approach_for_Medical_Images_Noise_Reduction_Based_RBF_Neural_Network_Filter","313178942_Reduced_lung-cancer_mortality_with_low-dose_computed_tomographic_screening","312771295_Image_quality_assessment_From_error_visibility_to_structural_similarity","300080713_Emphysema_Quantification_Using_Ultralow-Dose_CT_With_Iterative_Reconstruction_and_Filtered_Back_Projection","290868604_Role_of_robust_processing_in_ANN_de-noising_of_2D_image","262395872_Random_Search_for_Hyper-Parameter_Optimization","261515405_Ultra-low-dose_CT_of_the_Lung_Effect_of_Iterative_Reconstruction_Techniques_on_Image_Quality"]}
