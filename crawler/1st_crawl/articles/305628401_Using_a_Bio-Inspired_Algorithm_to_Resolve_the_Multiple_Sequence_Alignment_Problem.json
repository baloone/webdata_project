{"id":"305628401_Using_a_Bio-Inspired_Algorithm_to_Resolve_the_Multiple_Sequence_Alignment_Problem","abstract":"One of the most challenging tasks in bioinformatics is the resolution of Multiple Sequence Alignment MSA problem. It consists in comparing a set of protein or DNA sequences, in aim of predicting their structure and function. This paper introduces a new bio-inspired approach to solve such problem. This approach named BA-MSA is based on Bat Algorithm. Bat Algorithm BA is a recent evolutionary algorithm inspired from Bats behavior seeking their prey. The proposed approach includes new mechanism to generate initial population. It consists in generating a guide tree for each solution with progressive approach by varying some parameters. The generated guide tree will be enhanced by Hill-Climbing algorithm. In addition, to deal with the premature convergence of BA, a new restart technique is proposed to introduce more diversification when detecting premature convergence. Balibase 2.0 datasets are used for experiments. The comparison with well-known methods as MSA-GA MSA-GA w\\prealign, ClustalW, and SAGA and recent method BBOMP shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","authors":["El-amine Zemali","Abdelmadjid Boukra"],"meta":["July 2016International Journal of Applied Metaheuristic Computing 7(3):36-55","DOI:10.4018/IJAMC.2016070103"],"references":["235323870_BBA_A_Binary_Bat_Algorithm_for_Feature_Selection","280930287_A_Novel_Method_for_Progressive_Multiple_Sequence_Alignment_Based_on_Lempel-Ziv","225266453_Multiple_Sequence_Alignment_Based_on_Chaotic_PSO"]}
