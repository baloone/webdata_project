{"id":"319561839_Simulation-Based_Design_of_ED_Operations_with_Care_Streams_to_Optimize_Care_Delivery_and_Reduce_Length_of_Stay_in_the_Emergency_Department","abstract":"Faced with the opportunity to significantly deviate from classic operations, a new emergency department (ED) and novel strategy for patient care delivery were simultaneously initiated with the aid of model-based simulation. To answer the design and implementation questions, a traditional strategy for construction of discrete-eventmodel simulation was employed to define ED operations for a newly constructed facility in terms of workflow, variables, resources, structure, process logic and associated assumptions. Benefits were achieved before, during and after implementation of an unprecedented operations strategyâ€”i.e., the organization of the ED care delivery around four care streams: Critical, Diagnostic, Therapeutic and Fast Track. Prior to opening, it shed light on the range of context variables where benefits might be anticipated, and it facilitated staff understanding and judgements of performance. Two years after opening, the operations data is compared to the simulation with encouraging results that shed light on where to continue pursuit of improvement.","authors":["Duane Steward","Todd F.
