{"id":"238701979_System_Theoretic_Formalisms_for_Combined_Discrete-Continuous_System_Simulation","abstract":"In this paper we present an approach to combined discrete-continuous modelling which can be used to model and simulate an intelligent multi-layer control architecture as can be found in high autonomy systems. The modelling approach is based on system theoretical concepts; the three system specification formalisms-differential equation, discrete time, and the discrete event system specification formalism-have been combined to facilitate multi-formalisms modelling. Simulation concepts are based on the abstract simulator concept for discrete event simulation developed by Zeigler. Similar simulation methods have been developed to simulate modular, hierarchical discrete time and differential equation specified systems as well as multi-formalism models. Included in the paper are several examples of multi-formalism models together with the simulation results from the STIMS environment-an implementation of the modelling and simulation concepts in Interlisp-D/LOOPS.","authors":["Herbert Pr√§hofer"],"meta":["October 1991International Journal of General Systems 19(3):226-240","DOI:10.1080/03081079108935175"],"references":["234759522_Combined_continuousdiscrete_simulation_applications_techniques_and_tools","345811115_Matematische_Systemtheorie","268976217_Multifaceted_Modelling_and_Discrete_Event_Simulation","255903243_Hierarchical_modular_discrete-event_modelling_in_an_object-oriented_environment","245696390_Combined_discretecontinuous_system_simulation_by_use_of_digital_computers_techniques_and_tools","242585652_Model_construction_with_gpss-fortran_version_3","242503328_Gest_-_a_modelling_and_simulation_language_based_on_system_theoretic_concepts","242382951_System-Theoretic_Representation_of_Simulation_Models","236402236_Object-oriented_simulation_with_hierarchical_modular_models","226551457_Towards_intelligent_autonomous_control_systems_Architecture_and_fundamental_issues"]}
