{"id":"326725221_A_Survey_on_Automatic_Detection_of_Hate_Speech_in_Text","abstract":"The scientific study of hate speech, from a computer science point of view, is recent. This survey organizes and describes the current state of the field, providing a structured overview of previous approaches, including core algorithms, methods, and main features used. This work also discusses the complexity of the concept of hate speech, defined in many platforms and contexts, and provides a unifying definition. This area has an unquestionable potential for societal impact, particularly in online communities and digital media platforms. The development and systematization of shared resources, such as guidelines, annotated datasets in multiple languages, and algorithms, is a crucial step in advancing the automatic detection of hate speech.","authors":["Paula Fortuna","SÃ©rgio Nunes"],"meta":["July 2018ACM Computing Surveys 51(4):1-30","DOI:10.1145/3232676"],"references":["317300025_Deep_Learning_for_Hate_Speech_Detection_in_Tweets","316971988_Hate_me_hate_me_not_Hate_speech_detection_on_Facebook","314942659_Automated_Hate_Speech_Detection_and_the_Problem_of_Offensive_Language","312827109_Using_KNN_and_SVM_Based_One-Class_Classifier_for_Detecting_Online_Radicalization_on_Twitter","312520998_Characterizing_Linguistic_Attributes_for_Automatic_Classification_of_Intent_Based_RacistRadicalized_Posts_on_Tumblr_Micro-Blogging_Website","307536780_A_Dictionary-based_Approach_to_Racism_Detection_in_Dutch_Social_Media","307456661_Measuring_the_Reliability_of_Hate_Speech_Annotations_The_Case_of_the_European_Refugee_Crisis","305676874_Whitewashing_the_nation_racist_jokes_and_the_construction_of_the_African_'other'_in_Greek_popular_cinema","301837126_Analyzing_the_Targets_of_Hate_in_Online_Social_Media","300714599_Cyberbullying_Detection_and_Classification_Using_Information_Retrieval_Algorithm","299372432_Us_and_them_identifying_cyber_hate_on_Twitter_across_multiple_protected_characteristics","283125668_A_Lexicon-based_Approach_for_Hate_Speech_Detection","280878038_To_be_or_not_to_be_Charlie_Twitter_hashtags_as_a_discourse_and_counter-discourse_in_the_aftermath_of_the_2015_Charlie_Hebdo_shooting_in_France","277251549_They_Were_Just_Making_Jokes_EthnicRacial_Teasing_and_Discrimination_Among_Adolescents","276412348_Evaluation_From_precision_recall_and_F-measure_to_ROC_informedness_markedness_correlation","264312452_Text_Classification_Using_Association_Rules_Dependency_Pruning_and_Hyperonymization","262363934_Detecting_hate_speech_on_the_world_wide_web","251574306_The_Stanford_typed_dependencies_representation","230701861_Improved_Cyberbullying_Detection_Using_Gender_Information","220198629_Analyzing_the_semantic_content_and_persuasive_composition_of_extremist_media_A_case_study_of_texts_produced_during_the_Gaza_conflict","29651698_Classifying_racist_texts_using_a_support_vector_machine","2477440_Decision_Lists_For_Lexical_Ambiguity_Resolution_Application_to_Accent_Restoration_in_Spanish_and_French","318739472_A_Survey_on_Hate_Speech_Detection_using_Natural_Language_Processing","312963804_Equality_Diversity_and_Social_Justice","312638237_Abusive_Language_Detection_in_Online_User_Content","312250940_Are_You_a_Racist_or_Am_I_Seeing_Things_Annotator_Influence_on_Hate_Speech_Detection_on_Twitter","312250875_Do_Characters_Abuse_More_Than_Words","308273811_The_seriousness_of_ethnic_jokes_Ethnic_humor_and_social_change_in_the_Netherlands_1995-2012","305341890_Hateful_Symbols_or_Hateful_People_Predictive_Features_for_Hate_Speech_Detection_on_Twitter","305054938_Hate_Speech_Detection_with_Comment_Embeddings","304505654_Cyberbullying_Identification_Using_Participant-Vocabulary_Consistency","303362790_The_problem_of_identifying_misogynist_language_on_Twitter_and_other_online_social_spaces","301453139_New_Classification_Models_for_Detecting_Hate_and_Violence_Web_Content","301444838_Analysis_of_cyberbullying_tweets_in_trending_world_events","289050526_Combining_N-gram_based_Similarity_Analysis_with_Sentiment_Analysis_in_Web_Content_Classification","282794277_Hate_speech_A_quality_of_service_challenge","279816811_Ruminati_modeling_the_detection_of_textual_cyber-bullying","275412246_Cyber_Hate_Speech_on_Twitter_An_Application_of_Machine_Classification_and_Statistical_Modeling_for_Policy_and_Decision_Making_Machine_Classification_of_Cyber_Hate_Speech","265731190_The_Influence_of_Sectarian_and_Tribal_Discourse_in_Newspapers_Readers'_Online_Comments_about_Freedom_of_Expression_Censorship_and_National_Unity_in_Kuwait","261579485_Perverts_and_sodomites_homophobia_as_hate_speech_in_Africa","261394382_Detecting_Offensive_Language_in_Social_Media_to_Protect_Adolescent_Online_Safety","251501498_Stanford_typed_dependencies_manual","248925203_A_Call_to_Educate_Participate_Invoke_and_Indict_Understanding_the_Communication_of_Online_Hate_Groups","238469084_Decision_Lists_for_Lexical","225355588_Adaptive_least_squares_support_vector_machines_filter_for_hand_tremor_canceling_in_microsurgery","221297959_Modeling_the_Detection_of_Textual_Cyberbullying","220874474_Decision_Lists_for_Lexical_Ambiguity_Resolution_Application_to_Accent_Restoration_in_Spanish_and_French","220017639_Content_Analysis_An_Introduction_To_Its_Methodology","4372171_Using_a_Semi-automatic_Keyword_Dictionary_for_Improving_Violent_Web_Site_Filtering"]}
