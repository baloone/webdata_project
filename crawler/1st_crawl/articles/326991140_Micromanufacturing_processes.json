{"id":"326991140_Micromanufacturing_processes","abstract":"Increased demand for and developments in micromanufacturing have created a need for a resource that covers both the science and technology of this rapidly growing area. With contributions from eminent professors and researchers actively engaged in teaching, research, and development, Micromanufacturing Processes details the basic principles, tools, techniques, and latest advances in micromanufacturing processes. It includes coverage of measurement techniques and research trends as well as a large number of cross-references, making it useful to the students and researchers alike. The book outlines the challenges faced not only in micromanufacturing but also in meso- and nanomanufacturing, exploring topics such as micromachining, micro welding, microforming, micromolding, nanofinishing and micro-/nano-metrology. It includes examples that demonstrate the capabilities of fabricating micro- / nano-products and micro- / nano-features on the macro and micro products. The text also discusses nanofinishing techniques giving surface finish in the domain of sub-nano level, micro welding techniques, namely, laser beam micro welding, electron beam micro welding, micro / nano patterning in large quantities, and micro / nano metrology principles and equipments. It goes on to describe devices such as nano spring, micro mixer, micro cantilever, to name just a few. Unique in its level of coverage, the book highlights new challenges in manufacturing and covers several different types of micromanufacturing processes, such as micromachining, microforming, microcasting, microjoining, nanofinishing, and micrometrology. The level of details, extensive references, figures, and diagrams make the book a reference that will become the standard for this field.","authors":["V.K.
