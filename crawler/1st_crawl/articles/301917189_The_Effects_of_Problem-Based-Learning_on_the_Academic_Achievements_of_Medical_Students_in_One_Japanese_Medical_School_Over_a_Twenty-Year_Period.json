{"id":"301917189_The_Effects_of_Problem-Based-Learning_on_the_Academic_Achievements_of_Medical_Students_in_One_Japanese_Medical_School_Over_a_Twenty-Year_Period","abstract":"Purpose: This investigation considered the cognitive outcomes, expressed by the academic achievement scores in basic and clinical sciences and the National Licensing Examination results of medical undergraduates.\nMethod: Cognitive outcomes were compared using the academic achievement scores in basic and clinical science and the National Medical Licensing Examination pass rates, during the two periods pre- and post-PBL.\nResults: The scores, were significantly higher post-PBL. Scores in clinical science were significantly higher in both male and female students post-PBL. Before PBL, the scores for female students were higher, whereas no difference between males and females was observed post-PBL.\nDiscussion: The results suggest that PBL is equal or superior to the traditional methods of developing cognitive ability. A superior pace of knowledge acquisition by male students after PBL was observed. This supports the hypothesis that PBL is a suitable education model for Confucian countries in place of predominantly classical teacher-centred education.","authors":["Masayuki Niwa","Takuya Saiki","Kazuhiko Fujisaki","Yasuyuki Suzuki"],"meta":["May 2016Health Professions Education 2(1)","DOI:10.1016/j.hpe.2016.01.003"],"references":["43952434_Validity_and_Problem-Based_Learning_Research_A_Review_of_Instruments_Used_to_Assess_Intended_Learning_Outcomes","14751207_Problem-based_learning_A_review_of_literature_on_its_outcomes_and_implementation_issues","277492958_Factors_associated_with_success_in_medical_school_systematic_review_of_the_literature","245968667_Problem-Based_Learning_A_Review_of_Literature_on_Its_Outcomes_and_Implementation_Issues","230876708_Problem-Based_Learning_An_Approach_to_Medical_Education","229158835_Rethinking_the_globalisation_of_problem-based_learning_How_culture_challenges_self-directed_learning","40646936_Problem_based_learning_and_academic_performance_in_residency","26767142_Medical_Education_Reform_The_Asian_Experience","23714424_Medical_education_in_Japan_A_challenge_to_the_healthcare_system","21636131_The_psychological_basis_of_problem-based_learning_A_review_of_the_evidence"]}
