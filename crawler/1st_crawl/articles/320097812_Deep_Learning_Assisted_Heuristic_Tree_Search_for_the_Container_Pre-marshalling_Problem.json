{"id":"320097812_Deep_Learning_Assisted_Heuristic_Tree_Search_for_the_Container_Pre-marshalling_Problem","abstract":"One of the key challenges for operations researchers solving real-world problems is designing and implementing high-quality heuristics to guide their search procedures. In the past, machine learning techniques have failed to play a major role in operations research approaches, especially in terms of guiding branching and pruning decisions. We integrate deep neural networks into a heuristic tree search procedure to decide which branch to choose next and to estimate a bound for pruning the search tree of an optimization problem. We call our approach Deep Learning assisted heuristic Tree Search (DLTS) and apply it to a well-known problem from the container terminals literature, the container pre-marshalling problem (CPMP). Our approach is able to learn heuristics customized to the CPMP solely through analyzing the solutions to CPMP instances, and applies this knowledge within a heuristic tree search to produce the highest quality heuristic solutions to the CPMP to date.","authors":["Andr√© Hottung","Shunji Tanaka","Kevin Tierney"],"meta":["September 2019Computers & Operations Research","DOI:10.1016/j.cor.2019.104781"],"references":["325795799_Towards_Effective_Deep_Learning_for_Constraint_Satisfaction_Problems","325372117_Accelerating_the_Branch-and-Price_Algorithm_Using_Machine_Learning","318837359_The_Geography_of_Transport_Systems","318830271_Learning_to_Run_Heuristics_in_Tree_Search","318136998_Learning_When_to_Use_a_Decomposition","312489294_Reactive_Dialectic_Search_Portfolios_for_MaxSAT","312130880_Markov_Chain_methods_for_the_Bipartite_Boolean_Quadratic_Programming_Problem","309738607_DeepCoder_Learning_to_Write_Programs","304489964_Solving_the_Pre-Marshalling_Problem_to_Optimality_with_A_and_IDA","292074166_Mastering_the_game_of_Go_with_deep_neural_networks_and_tree_search","290480833_Empirical_decision_model_learning","289194446_Deep_learning_for_real-time_Atari_game_play_using_offline_Monte-Carlo_tree_search_planning","280488747_Embedding_Decision_Trees_and_Random_Forests_in_Constraint_Programming","277958776_ASlib_A_Benchmark_Library_for_Algorithm_Selection","272195434_Learning_to_Search_Better_Than_Your_Teacher","267179036_Exploiting_Erraticism_in_Search","256442073_Hyper-heuristics_A_survey_of_the_state_of_the_art","238085345_FUTURE_PATHS_FOR_INTEGER_PROGRAMMING_AND_LINKS_TO_AR_TIFI_CIAL_INTELLI_G_EN_CE","225438444_Applying_the_corridor_method_to_a_blocks_relocation_problem","222721339_Future_Paths_for_Integer_Programming_and_Links_to_Artificial_Intelligence_Computers_Operations_Research_13_533-549","220812454_Limited_Discrepancy_Beam_Search","220669157_A_Computational_Study_of_Search_Strategies_for_Mixed_Integer_Programming","220462132_Crew_Assignment_via_Constraint_Programming_Integrating_Column_Generation_and_Heuristic_Tree_Search","332443460_A_Branch_and_Bound_Approach_for_Large_Pre-marshalling_Problems","326258038_An_Exact_Algorithm_for_the_Blocks_Relocation_Problem_with_New_Lower_Bounds","319122222_Learning_to_Plan_Chemical_Syntheses","317989043_Comments_on_On_learning_and_branching_a_survey","317973838_On_learning_and_branching_a_survey","317098790_Solving_real-world_sized_container_pre-marshalling_problems_with_an_iterative_deepening_branch-and-bound_algorithm","315807166_Learning_Combinatorial_Optimization_Algorithms_over_Graphs","312391393_A_Machine_Learning-Based_Approximation_of_Strong_Branching","303915051_A_feasibility-based_heuristic_for_the_container_pre-marshalling_problem","303508072_A_Biased_Random-Key_Genetic_Algorithm_for_the_Container_Pre-Marshalling_Problem","289581769_Learning_to_search_in_branch-and-bound_algorithms","285658102_On_the_Abstraction_Method_for_the_Container_Relocation_Problem","278048614_Pointer_Networks","270006700_Target-guided_algorithms_for_the_container_pre-marshalling_problem","269935079_Adam_A_Method_for_Stochastic_Optimization","267811595_A_Multi-Heuristic_Approach_for_Solving_the_Pre-Marshalling_Problem","262292602_An_Intelligent_Hyper-Heuristic_Framework_for_CHeSC_2011","255643134_Search-Based_Structured_Prediction_as_Classification","249964151_DASH_Dynamic_Approach_for_Switching_Heuristics","236236641_Pre-Marshalling_Problem_Heuristic_solution_method_and_instances_generator","232735414_Algorithm_Selection_for_Combinatorial_Search_Problems_A_Survey","224285715_Artificial_Intelligence_A_Modern_Approach","222674051_Branching_rules_revisited","220288872_A_tree_search_procedure_for_the_container_pre-marshalling_problem","220243695_Fine-Tuning_of_Algorithms_Using_Fractional_Experimental_Designs_and_Local_Search","45860532_Search-based_Structured_Prediction","23984382_A_neighborhood_search_heuristic_for_pre-marshalling_export_containers"]}
