The Partitioned Finite Element Method, introduced in Cardoso-Ribeiro et al. (2018), is a structure preserving numerical method which defines an underlying Dirac structure, and constitutive relations in weak form, leading to finite-dimensional port-Hamiltonian Differential Algebraic systems (pHDAE). Different types of dissipation are examined: internal damping, boundary damping and also diffusion models.","authors":["Anass Serhani","Denis Matignon","Ghislain Haine"],"meta":["August 2019","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-26980-7_57","In book: Geometric Science of Information (pp.549-558)"],"references":["335374388_Anisotropic_heterogeneous_n-D_heat_equation_with_boundary_control_and_observation_I_Modeling_as_port-Hamiltonian_system","335371145_Partitioned_Finite_Element_Method_for_port-Hamiltonian_systems_with_Boundary_Damping_Anisotropic_Heterogeneous_2D_wave_equations","335370270_Anisotropic_heterogeneous_n-D_heat_equation_with_boundary_control_and_observation_II_Structure-preserving_discretization","333375459_Port-Hamiltonian_formulation_and_symplectic_discretization_of_plate_models_Part_I_Mindlin_model_for_thick_plates","332914440_Port-Hamiltonian_formulation_and_symplectic_discretization_of_plate_models_Part_II_Kirchhoff_model_for_thin_plates","325334756_A_structure-preserving_Partitioned_Finite_Element_Method_PFEM_for_the_2D_wave_equation","324744651_Structure_preserving_approximation_of_dissipative_evolution_problems","348007414_A_Partitioned_Finite_Element_Method_for_power-preserving_discretization_of_open_systems_of_conservation_laws","339908979_Structure-preserving_discretization_for_port-Hamiltonian_descriptor_systems","326084501_Finite_differences_on_taggered_grids_preserving_the_port-Hamiltonian_structure_with_application_to_an_acoustic_duc"]}
