{"id":"251232344_A_Tight_Upper_Bound_on_Acquaintance_Time_of_Graphs","abstract":"In this note we confirm a conjecture raised by Benjamini et al. \\cite{BST} on\nthe acquaintance time of graphs, proving that for all graphs $G$ with $n$\nvertices it holds that $\\AC(G) = O(n^{3/2})$, which is tight up to a\nmultiplicative constant. This is done by proving that for all graphs $G$ with\n$n$ vertices and maximal degree $\\Delta$ it holds that $\\AC(G) \\leq 20 \\Delta\nn$. Combining this with the bound $\\AC(G) \\leq O(n^2/\\Delta)$ from \\cite{BST}\ngives the foregoing uniform upper bound of all $n$-vertex graphs.\nWe also prove that for the $n$-vertex path $P_n$ it holds that\n$\\AC(P_n)=n-2$. In addition we show that the barbell graph $B_n$ consisting of\ntwo cliques of sizes $\\ceil{n/2}$ and $\\floor{n/2}$ connected by a single edge\nalso has $\\AC(B_n) = n-2$. This shows that it is possible to add $\\Omega(n^2)$\nedges to $P_n$ without changing the $\\AC$ value of the graph.","authors":["Omer Angel","Igor Shinkar"],"meta":["September 2016Graphs and Combinatorics 32(5)","DOI:10.1007/s00373-016-1700-4","SourcearXiv"],"references":["236651535_A_Note_on_the_Acquaintance_Time_of_Random_Graphs","235438807_Acquaintance_Time_of_a_Graph","312662157_A_Survey_of_Gossiping_and_Broadcasting_in_Communication_Networks","275367091_The_acquaintance_time_of_percolated_random_geometric_graphs","263054727_Acquaintance_Time_of_Random_Graphs_Near_Connectivity_Threshold","259478419_The_acquaintance_time_of_percolated_random_geometric_graphs","246106899_Eva_Tardos_Maximizing_the_spread_of_influence_through_a_social_network","229455470_A_Survey_of_Broadcasting_and_Gossiping_in_Communication_Networks","222758339_Hamilton_cycles_in_random_graphs","220532994_Routing_Permutations_on_Graphs_Via_Matchings","220268417_Routing_Permutations_on_Graphs_via_Matchings"]}
