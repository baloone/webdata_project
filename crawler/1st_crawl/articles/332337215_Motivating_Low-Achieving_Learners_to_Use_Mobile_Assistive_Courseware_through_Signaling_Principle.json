{"id":"332337215_Motivating_Low-Achieving_Learners_to_Use_Mobile_Assistive_Courseware_through_Signaling_Principle","abstract":"Developing a courseware is easy. However, making a courseware usable for its target user requires a scientific process. As a response to that, a study has been carried out in making courseware usable for low-achieving learners. As part of the study, this paper aims to describe the application of signaling principles in the developed courseware specifically for low-achieving learners. The prototype has been developed through user-centered approach. It involved users during the designing and development process. Then, it was delivered to users. Their experience dealing with the developed prototype was observed in their natural context with assistance of their teachers. Eventually, it was found that they were highly motivated to use the courseware.","authors":["Ariffin AM","Siti Zulaiha Ahmad","S.
