{"id":"319900354_Approximate_Solution_of_Nonlinear_Duffing_Oscillator_Using_Taylor_Expansion","abstract":"The Duffing oscillator is a common model for nonlinear phenomena in science and engineering. Its mathematical model is a second order differential equation with nonlinear spring force used to describe the motion of a damped oscillator with a more complicated potential than in simple harmonic motion. In the present paper, the Duffing oscillator equation is solved using a new simple technique based on Taylor theory. The Duffing oscillator equation is solved with different values of initial conditions and damping. The solution results are compared with Runge–Kutta 4th order numerical solution method to investigate the accuracy and reliability of the suggested technique. Results show an excellent agreement between the proposed technique and the Runge–Kutta method.","authors":["Abdelrady Okasha El-Nady"],"meta":["September 2016","DOI:10.5923/j.jmea.20160605.03"],"references":["280778241_Approximate_solution_for_nonlinear_Duffing_oscillator_with_damping_effect_using_the_modified_differential_transform_method","276346046_Application_of_the_Laplace_Decomposition_Method_to_Nonlinear_Homogeneous_and_Non-Homogenous_Advection_Equations","312448954_Comment_on_He's_frequency_formulation_for_nonlinear_oscillators","284689626_Free_vibration_analysis_of_strongly_nonlinear_generalized_Duffing_oscillators_using_He's_variational_approach_homotopy_perturbation_method","284211031_Nonlinear_oscillators_with_non-polynomial_and_discontinuous_elastic_restoring_forces","274226945_High_Order_He's_Energy_Balance_Method_based_on_Collocation_Method","271614249_Residue_harmonic_balance_analysis_for_the_damped_Duffing_resonator_driven_by_a_van_der_Pol_oscillator","270456823_Max-Min_Approach_to_Nonlinear_Oscillators","265581151_Analytic_approach_to_investigation_of_fluctuation_and_frequency_of_the_oscillators_with_odd_and_even_nonlinearities","263313252_The_differential_transform_method_and_Pade_approximants_for_a_fractional_population_growth_model"]}
