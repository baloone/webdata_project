{"id":"339097144_Incorporating_Particle_Swarm_Optimization_into_Improved_Bacterial_Foraging_Optimization_Algorithm_Applied_to_Classify_Imbalanced_Data","abstract":"In this paper, particle swarm optimization is incorporated into an improved bacterial foraging optimization algorithm, which is applied to classifying imbalanced data to solve the problem of how original bacterial foraging optimization easily falls into local optimization. In this study, the borderline synthetic minority oversampling technique (Borderline-SMOTE) and Tomek link are used to pre-process imbalanced data. Then, the proposed algorithm is used to classify the imbalanced data. In the proposed algorithm, firstly, the chemotaxis process is improved. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to search first and then treat the result as bacteria, improving the global searching ability of bacterial foraging optimization (BFO). Secondly, the reproduction operation is improved and the selection standard of survival of the cost is improved. Finally, we improve elimination and dispersal operation, and the population evolution factor is introduced to prevent the population from stagnating and falling into a local optimum. In this paper, three data sets are used to test the performance of the proposed algorithm. The simulation results show that the classification accuracy of the proposed algorithm is better than the existing approaches.","authors":["Fu-Lan Ye","Chou-Yuan Lee","Zne-Jung Lee","Jian-Qiong Huang"],"meta":["February 2020Symmetry 12(2):229","DOI:10.3390/sym12020229"],"references":["336582274_An_Improved_Pigeon-Inspired_Optimisation_Algorithm_and_Its_Application_in_Parameter_Inversion","331855623_Incremental_Granular_Model_Improvement_Using_Particle_Swarm_Optimization","328357479_Multi-objective_Optimization_of_VSC_Stations_in_Multi-terminal_VSC-HVdc_Grids_based_on_PSO","333588331_Optimization_of_the_shape_parameter_of_RBF_based_on_the_PSO_algorithm_to_solve_nonlinear_stochastic_differential_equation","330890316_A_Novel_Hybrid_Model_Based_on_TVIW-PSO-GSA_Algorithm_and_Support_Vector_Machine_for_Classification_Problems","326188956_Farthest_SMOTE_A_Modified_SMOTE_Approach","325028425_An_idea_of_a_clustering_algorithm_using_support_vector_machines_based_on_binary_decision_tree","324337644_Linear_Models_for_Unbalanced_Data","320319903_Classification_of_Imbalanced_Data_by_Oversampling_in_Kernel_Space_of_Support_Vector_Machines","319599704_Distributed-Graph-Based_Statistical_Approach_for_Intrusion_Detection_in_Cyber-Physical_Systems"]}
