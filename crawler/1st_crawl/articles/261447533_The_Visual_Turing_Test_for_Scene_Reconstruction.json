{"id":"261447533_The_Visual_Turing_Test_for_Scene_Reconstruction","abstract":"We present the first large scale system for capturing and rendering relight able scene reconstructions from massive unstructured photo collections taken under different illumination conditions and viewpoints. We combine photos taken from many sources, Flickr-Based ground-level imagery, oblique aerial views, and street view, to recover models that are significantly more complete and detailed than previously demonstrated. We demonstrate the ability to match both the viewpoint and illumination of arbitrary input photos, enabling a Visual Turing Test in which photo and rendering are viewed side-by-side and the observer has to guess which is which. While we cannot yet fool human perception, the gap is closing.","authors":["Qi Shan","Riley Adams","Brian Curless","Yasutaka Furukawa"],"meta":["June 2013","DOI:10.1109/3DV.2013.12","Conference: 3DV-Conference, 2013 International Conference on"],"references":["262366198_Heliometric_Stereo_Shape_from_Sun_Position","262323044_Coherent_Intrinsic_Images_from_Photo_Collections","226565872_Building_Rome_on_a_Cloudless_Day","221363626_Towards_Internet-scale_Multi-view_Stereo","44683582_Accurate_Dense_and_Robust_Multiview_Stereopsis","314450671_Relighting_objects_from_image_collections","312152791_Poisson_surface_reconstruction","261336862_Photometric_Stereo_for_Outdoor_Webcams","221416047_Fast_Approximate_Nearest_Neighbors_with_Automatic_Algorithm_Configuration","221363932_Relighting_objects_from_image_collections","221316529_Screened_Poisson_Surface_Reconstruction","220421169_Building_Rome_in_a_Day","2427364_Area_Light_Sources_for_Real-Time_Graphics"]}
