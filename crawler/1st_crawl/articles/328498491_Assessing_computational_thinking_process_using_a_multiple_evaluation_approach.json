{"id":"328498491_Assessing_computational_thinking_process_using_a_multiple_evaluation_approach","abstract":"This study explored the ways that the Computational Thinking (CT) process can be evaluated in a classroom environment. Thirty Children aged 10–11 years, from a primary school in London took part in a game-making project using the Scratch and Alice 2.4 applications for eight months. For the focus of this specific paper, data from participant observations, informal conversations, problem-solving sheets, semi-structured interviews and children's completed games were used to make sense of elements of the computational thinking process and approaches to evaluate these elements in a computer game design context. The discussions around what CT consists, highlighted the complex structure of computational thinking and the interaction between the elements of artificial intelligence (AI), computer, cognitive, learning and psychological sciences. This also emphasised the role of metacognition in the Computational Thinking process. These arguments illustrated that it is not possible to evaluate Computational Thinking using only programming constructs, as CT process provides opportunities for developing many other skills and concepts. Therefore a multiple evaluation approach should be adopted to illustrate the full learning scope of the Computational Thinking Process. Using the support of literature review and the findings of the data analysis I proposed a multiple approach evaluation model where ‘computational concepts’, ‘metacognitive practices’, and ‘learning behaviours’ were discussed as the main elements of the CT process. Additionally, in order to investigate these dimensions within a game-making context, computer game design was also included in this evaluation model.","authors":["Yasemin Allsop"],"meta":["October 2018International Journal of Child-Computer Interaction 19","DOI:10.1016/j.ijcci.2018.10.004"],"references":["312058363_Incorporating_Touch-based_Tablets_into_Classroom_Activities_Fostering_Children's_Computational_Thinking_through_iPad_Integrated_Instruction","293328901_Constructionist_Gaming_Understanding_the_Benefits_of_Making_Games_for_Learning","284181364_Dr_Scratch_a_Web_Tool_to_Automatically_Evaluate_Scratch_Projects","275771253_Systems_of_Assessments_for_Deeper_Learning_of_Computational_Thinking_in_K-12","274309848_Computational_Thinking","265855816_Learning_problem-solving_through_making_games_at_the_game_design_and_learning_summer_program","262350755_Computational_Thinking_in_Elementary_and_Secondary_Teacher_Education","257369416_Approaches_to_Collaborative_Game-Making_for_Fostering_21st_Century_Skills","246829736_Minds_in_Play_Computer_Game_Design_As_A_Context_for_Children's_Learning","246291950_Electronic_play_worlds_Gender_differences_in_children's_constructions_of_video_games","225234905_Promoting_Self-Regulation_in_Science_Education_Metacognition_as_Part_of_a_Broader_Perspective_on_Learning","221629475_All_I_really_need_to_know_about_creative_thinking_I_learned_by_studying_how_children_learn_in_kindergarten","221538265_Thinking_about_Computational_Thinking","220807989_Using_Scalable_Game_Design_to_teach_computer_science_from_middle_school_to_graduate_school","42789850_Conducting_research_with_young_children_Some_ethical_considerations","7561647_Three_Approaches_to_Qualitative_Content_Analysis","349861097_Behaviour_for_Learning_Proactive_Approaches_to_Behaviour_Management","326356807_Qualitative_Research_in_Sociology","324373353_Mindstorms_Children_Computers_and_Powerful_Ideas","315598410_Artificial_intelligence_computational_thinking_and_mathematics_education","299364602_Refining_an_understanding_of_computational_thinking","284886595_The_girl_game_company_Engaging_latina_girls_in_information_technology","272566756_Qualitative_Data_Analysis_A_Methods_Sourcebook","262309212_Computation_and_Computational_Thinking","249134377_Elementary_School_Students'_Reports_of_the_Causes_and_Effects_of_Problem_Difficulty_in_Mathematics","240793119_Computer_Programming_in_Middle_School_How_Pairs_Respond_to_Challenges","234662980_Wise_Up_The_Challenge_of_Lifelong_Learning","232599909_Metacognition_and_Cognitive_Monitoring_A_New_Area_of_Cognitive-Developmental_Inquiry","232567308_The_role_of_metacognition_in_problem-solving","226753677_Metacognition_Abilities_and_Developing_Expertise_What_Makes_an_Expert_Student","225682124_The_development_of_two_observational_tools_for_assessing_metacognition_and_self-regulated_learning_in_young_children","200772461_Thought_And_Language","49308663_The_SAGE_handbook_of_Qualitative_Research","15030384_Teaching_children_to_be_bad"]}
