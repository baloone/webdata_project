{"id":"334151516_GENDER_DIFFERENCES_IN_ENGLISH_LANGUAGE_AND_SCIENCE_RELATED_SUBJECTS_IN_THE_CONTEXT_OF_HIGHER_EDUCATION_IN_THAILAND","abstract":"This study was conducted at a university in the surrounding areas of Bangkok to cross-compare academic performances between female (n = 406) and male (n = 496) students in both English language skills and GPA scores in science-based subjects. \n902 second-year students were selected from four separate faculties to examine the interaction of the gender variable across a broader spectrum of academic backgrounds; faculty subgroups were clustered accordingly: business studies (n = 315), engineering (n = 317), computer science (n = 178) and veterinary medicine (n = 92). \nT-tests calculations indicated that female students' level of attainment was significantly higher in both academic spheres: English (females: 56.85, males: 47.87; [sig: p = <0.05]); GPA (females: 70.5, males; 63.75; [sig: p = <0.05]). Furthermore, according to faculty subgroup comparisons, females consistently outperformed their male counterparts in both English language and science related subjects, and also outnumbered their male peers in the top-100 achievers in both domains.","authors":["Matthew Rudd"],"meta":["June 2019","Project: The Role of the Gender Variable in English Language Performance"],"references":["232549605_Role_of_Mathematics_Self-Efficacy_in_the_Choice_of_Math-Related_Majors_of_College_Women_and_Men_A_Path_Analysis","303249251_Development_of_achievement_motivation","252064451_General_Intelligence_Objectively_Determined_and_Measured","233896767_Gender_Roles_and_Women's_Achievement-Related_Decisions","233896670_StageEnvironment_Fit_Developmentally_Appropriate_Classrooms_for_Young_Adolescents","232603513_Role_of_Self-Efficacy_and_Self-Concept_Beliefs_in_Mathematical_Problem_Solving_A_Path_Analysis","232508992_Gender_differences_in_writing_self-beliefs_of_elementary_school_students_Journal_of_Educational_Psychology_911_50-61"]}
