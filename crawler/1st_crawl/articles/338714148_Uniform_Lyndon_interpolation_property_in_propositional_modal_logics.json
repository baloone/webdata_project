{"id":"338714148_Uniform_Lyndon_interpolation_property_in_propositional_modal_logics","abstract":"We introduce and investigate the notion of uniform Lyndon interpolation property (ULIP) which is a strengthening of both uniform interpolation property and Lyndon interpolation property. We prove several propositional modal logics including K, KB, GL and Grz enjoy ULIP. Our proofs are modifications of Visser’s proofs of uniform interpolation property using layered bisimulations (Visser, in: Hájek (ed) Gödel’96, logical foundations of mathematics, computer science and physics—Kurt Gödel’s legacy, Springer, Berlin, 1996). Also we give a new upper bound on the complexity of uniform interpolants for GL and Grz.","authors":["Taishi Kurahashi"],"meta":["August 2020Archive for Mathematical Logic 59(5-6):659--678","DOI:10.1007/s00153-020-00713-y"],"references":["325068395_Uniform_interpolation_and_sequent_calculi_in_modal_logic","344486660_Modal_Logic","322944127_The_Logic_of_Provability","309588126_Proving_Craig_and_Lyndon_Interpolation_Using_Labelled_Sequent_Calculi","285343105_Beth's_Theorem_and_Self-Referential_Sentences","268975302_Lyndon's_interpolation_theorem_in_modal_logics","266701330_Interpolation_in_S5_and_some_related_systems","266256909_Proof_Methods_for_Modal_and_Intuitionistic_Logic","263726493_The_Lyndon_property_and_uniform_interpolation_over_the_Grzegorczyk_logic","259810779_Modal_Logic"]}
