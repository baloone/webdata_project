{"id":"343343117_Dynamics_of_entangled_networks_of_the_quantum_Internet","abstract":"Entangled quantum networks are a fundamental of any global-scale quantum Internet. Here, a mathematical model is developed to quantify the dynamics of entangled network structures and entanglement flow in the quantum Internet. The analytical solutions of the model determine the equilibrium states of the entangled quantum networks and characterize the stability, fluctuation attributes, and dynamics of entanglement flow in entangled network structures. We demonstrate the results of the model through various entangled structures and quantify the dynamics.","authors":["Laszlo Gyongyosi"],"meta":["July 2020Scientific Reports 10(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-020-68498-x"],"references":["349578031_Quantum_Computer_Systems_for_Scientific_Discovery","349577854_Development_of_Quantum_Interconnects_QuICs_for_Next-Generation_Information_Technologies","349045564_Quantum_approximate_optimization_of_non-planar_graph_problems_on_a_planar_superconducting_processor","347427245_A_Survey_on_Quantum_Key_Distribution","347177588_Efficient_Routing_for_Quantum_Key_Distribution_Networks","344979894_Demonstrating_a_Continuous_Set_of_Two-Qubit_Gates_for_Near-Term_Quantum_Algorithms","343025488_Routing_space_exploration_for_scalable_routing_in_the_quantum_Internet","342367840_Entanglement_concentration_service_for_the_quantum_Internet","351591762_Quantum_Computer_Systems_for_Scientific_Discovery","341635351_Approximate_approximation_on_a_quantum_annealer"]}
