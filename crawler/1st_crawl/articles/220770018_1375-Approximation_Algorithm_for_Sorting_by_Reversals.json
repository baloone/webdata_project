{"id":"220770018_1375-Approximation_Algorithm_for_Sorting_by_Reversals","abstract":"Analysis of genomes evolving by inversions leads to a general combinatorial problem of Sorting by Reversals, MIN-SBR, the problem of sorting a permutation by a minimum number of reversals. Following a series of preliminary results,\nHannenhalli and Pevzner developed the first exact polynomial time algorithm for the problem of sorting signed permutations\nby reversals, and a polynomial time algorithm for a special case of unsigned permutations. The best known approximation algorithm\nfor MIN-SBR, due to Christie, gives a performance ratio of 1.5. In this paper, by exploiting the polynomial time algorithm \nfor sorting signed permutations and by developing a new approximation algorithm for maximum cycle decomposition of breakpoint\ngraphs, we design a new 1.375-algorithm for the MIN-SBR problem.","authors":["Piotr Berman","Sridhar Hannenhalli","Marek Karpinski"],"meta":["September 2002Lecture Notes in Computer Science","DOI:10.1007/3-540-45749-6_21","SourceDBLP","Conference: Algorithms - ESA 2002, 10th Annual European Symposium, Rome, Italy, September 17-21, 2002, Proceedings"],"references":["226954865_Exact_and_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Sorting_by_Reversals_with_Application_to_Genome_Rearrangement","221313875_Fast_Sorting_by_Reversal","220617554_A_Faster_and_Simpler_Algorithm_for_Sorting_Signed_Permutations_by_Reversals","21524891_Gene_Order_Comparisons_for_Phylogenetic_Inference_Evolution_of_the_Mitochondrial_Genome","269200076_Transforming_cabbage_into_turnip","247047201_On_the_size_of_systems_of_sets_every_t_of_which_have_an_SDR","238708318_Exact_and_approximation_algorithms_for_the_inversion_distance_between_two_permutations","223925415_On_the_problem_of_sorting_burnt_pancakes","222437944_Bounds_for_sorting_by_prefix_reversal","221530668_Sorting_by_reversals_is_difficult","220896799_On_Some_Tighter_Inapproximability_Results_Extended_Abstract","220780495_A_32-Approximation_Algorithm_for_Sorting_by_Reversals","220779414_Approximating_Maximum_Independent_Set_in_Bounded_Degree_Graphs","220618108_Genome_Rearrangements_and_Sorting_by_Reversals","220406736_Reversing_Trains_A_Turn_of_the_Century_Sorting_Problem","20842372_Genomic_divergence_through_gene_rearrangement"]}
