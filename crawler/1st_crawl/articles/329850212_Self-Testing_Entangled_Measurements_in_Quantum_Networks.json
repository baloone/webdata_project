{"id":"329850212_Self-Testing_Entangled_Measurements_in_Quantum_Networks","abstract":"Self-testing refers to the possibility of characterizing an unknown quantum device based only on the observed statistics. Here we develop methods for self-testing entangled quantum measurements, a key element for quantum networks. Our approach is based on the natural assumption that separated physical sources in a network should be considered independent. This provides a natural formulation of the problem of certifying entangled measurements. Considering the setup of entanglement swapping, we derive a robust self-test for the Bell-state measurement, tolerating noise levels up to ∼5%. We also discuss generalizations to other entangled measurements.","authors":["Marc-Olivier Renou","Jędrzej Kaniewski","Nicolas Brunner"],"meta":["December 2018Physical Review Letters 121(25)","DOI:10.1103/PhysRevLett.121.250507"],"references":["326883034_Self-Testing_multipartite_entangled_states_through_projections_onto_two_systems","320736872_Towards_a_global_quantum_network","311842325_High-fidelity_entanglement_swapping_and_generation_of_three-qubit_GHZ_state_using_asynchronous_telecom_photon_pair_sources","329850712_Noise-Resistant_Device-Independent_Certification_of_Bell_State_Measurements","329204019_Semi-device-independent_characterization_of_multipartite_entanglement_of_states_and_measurements","323130140_On_the_Einstein_Podolsky_Rosen_paradox","323003847_Certifying_the_Building_Blocks_of_Quantum_Computers_from_Bell's_Theorem","322713760_Self-testing_quantum_states_and_measurements_in_the_prepare-and-measure_scenario","319300533_Witnessing_Irreducible_Dimension","313893347_Self-testing_of_binary_observables_based_on_commutation"]}
