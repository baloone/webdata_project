{"id":"329417928_An_Iterative_Path-Breaking_Approach_with_Mutation_and_Restart_Strategies_for_the_MAX-SAT_Problem","abstract":"Although Path-Relinking is an effective local search method for many combinatorial optimization problems, its application is not straightforward in solving the MAX-SAT, an optimization variant of the satisfiability problem (SAT) that has many real-world applications and has gained more and more attention in academy and industry. Indeed, it was not used in any recent competitive MAX-SAT algorithms in our knowledge. In this paper, we propose a new local search algorithm called IPBMR for the MAX-SAT, that remedies the drawbacks of the Path-Relinking method by using a careful combination of three components: A new strategy named Path-Breaking to avoid unpromising regions of the search space when generating trajectories between an elite solution and its inverse solution; a weak and a strong mutation strategies, together with restarts, to diversify the search; and stochastic path generating steps to avoid premature local optimum solutions. We then present experimental results to show that IPBMR outperforms two of the best state-of-the-art MAX-SAT local search solvers, and an empirical investigation to identify and explain the effect of the three components in IPBMR.","authors":["Zhenxing Xu","Kun He","Chu-Min Li"],"meta":["December 2018Computers & Operations Research 104","DOI:10.1016/j.cor.2018.12.005"],"references":[]}
