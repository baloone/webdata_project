{"id":"261181145_The_Development_of_Tiny_Encryption_Algorithm_TEA_Crypto-Core_for_Mobile_Systems","abstract":"In this paper, a cryptographic algorithm design called Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) is proposed in order to minimize the memory footprint and maximize the speed. The design was targeted for embedded and mobile systems which concern more on speed and space. In TEA, the plaintext is encrypted and decrypted using the operations from mixed (orthogonal) algebraic groups and a huge number of rounds to achieve security with simplicity. At sixty-four (64) Feistel rounds, a total of 2,883 gates are used in the TEA encryption process with 16.72ns delay time while 2,805 gates are consumed in the decryption process with 14.78ns delay time. With these outcomes, the design is possible to be implemented on mobile devices which require considerable extent of security.","authors":["Stephanie Ang Yee Hun","Siti Zarina Md Naziri","Norina Idris"],"meta":["November 2012","DOI:10.1109/ICEDSA.2012.6507813","Conference: 2012 IEEE International Conference on Electronics Design, Systems and Applications (ICEDSA)"],"references":["240215065_Related-Key_Cryptanalysis_of_3WAY","226479268_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","220942531_TEA_A_tiny_encryption_algorithm","4233376_Securing_Ubiquitous_and_Low-Cost_RFID_Using_Tiny_Encryption_Algorithm","2891073_Key-Schedule_Cryptanalysis_of_IDEA_G-DES","2646851_Key-schedule_cryptanalysis_of_idea_g-des_gost_safer_and_triple-des","2645630_Related-key_cryptanalysis_of_3-way_Biham-DES_CAST_DES-X_NewDES_RC2_and_TEA"]}
