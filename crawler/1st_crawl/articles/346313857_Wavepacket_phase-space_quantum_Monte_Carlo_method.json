{"id":"346313857_Wavepacket_phase-space_quantum_Monte_Carlo_method","abstract":"We develop a novel numerical method for solving the Wigner equation which does not rely upon evaluation of the Wigner kernel and utilizes quantum trajectories. This method is a generalization of the effective potential approach widely used in semiconductor TCAD tools while also solving the full Wigner equation. The methodâ€™s accuracy is demonstrated with several standard examples.","authors":["Ian Welland","David K.
