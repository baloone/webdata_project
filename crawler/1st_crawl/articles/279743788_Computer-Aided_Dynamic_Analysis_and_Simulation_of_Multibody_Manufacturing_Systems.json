{"id":"279743788_Computer-Aided_Dynamic_Analysis_and_Simulation_of_Multibody_Manufacturing_Systems","abstract":"This paper presents simulation of multibody manufacturing systems with the support of numerical tools. The dynamic and cybernetic characteristics of driving system are discussed. Simple prototype models of robot arm and machine toolâ€™s driving system are quickly established in Computer Aided Design (CAD) software inwhich the whole specification of material, inertia and so on are involved. The prototypes therefore are simulated in RecurDyn- a Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) software. The models are driven by controllers built in Matlab/Simulink via co-simulation. The results are suitable with theory and able to exploied for expansion of complexly effective factors. The research indicates that dynamic analysis and control could be done via numerical method instead of directly dynamic equation creation for multibody manufacturing systems.","authors":["Yunn-Lin Hwang","Jung Kuang Cheng","Van-Thuan Truong"],"meta":["May 2015Applied Mechanics and Materials 764-765:757-761","DOI:10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.764-765.757"],"references":["320708983_A_New_Approach_for_Dynamic_Analysis_and_Driving_Control_of_CNC_Machine_Tool","298208505_Recursive_Newton-Euler_formulation_for_flexible_dynamic_manufacturing_analysis_of_open-loop_robotic_systems","290309331_Co-Simulation_control_of_robot_arm_dynamics_in_ADAMS_and_MATLAB","226212446_Recursive_Newton-Euler_formulation_for_flexible_dynamic_manufacturing_analysis_of_open-loop_robotic_systems","223056285_A_new_approach_for_dynamic_analysis_of_flexible_manipulator_systems","292537811_Applied_Mechanics_and_Materials_Preface"]}
