{"id":"345146822_Sequanix_A_Dynamic_Graphical_Interface_for_Snakemake_Workflows","abstract":"We designed a PyQt graphical user interface – Sequanix – aiming at democratizing the use of Snakemake pipelines. Although the primary goal of Sequanix was to facilitate the execution of NGS Snakemake pipelines available in the Sequana project ( http://sequana.readthedocs.io ), it can also handle any Snakemake pipelines. Therefore, Sequanix should be useful to all Snakemake developers willing to expose their pipelines to a wider audience.\n\nAvailability\nSource code available on http://github.com/sequana/sequana and standalone on http://bioconda.github.io (sequana package).","authors":["Dimitri Desvillechabrol","Rachel Legendre","Claire Rioualen","Christiane Bouchier"],"meta":["July 2017","DOI:10.1101/162701"],"references":["309823722_Galaxy_A_comphrehensible_approach_for_supporting_accessible_reproducible_and_transparent_computational_research_in_the_life_sciences"]}
