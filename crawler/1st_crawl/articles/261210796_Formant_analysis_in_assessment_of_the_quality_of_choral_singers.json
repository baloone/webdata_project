{"id":"261210796_Formant_analysis_in_assessment_of_the_quality_of_choral_singers","abstract":"The motivation for taking up research on the quality of choral singing is the need to support the voice production of the choir members. The method presented here is developed to compare the quality of the choir singers using formant parameters. The choir singers classified as poor were compared to members of groups of average and good singers. The frequency of the first four formants in corresponding fragments of vocal exercises at the same pitch level was analyzed. Analysis of the results shows that the parameters of formants allow one to distinguish the poor singers from the average and good. It can therefore be assumed that these parameters can be used as an automated system to assess the quality of singing and the classification of singers. The study was carried out on recordings of the members of an academic choir.","authors":["Edward Polrolniczak","Michal Kramarczyk"],"meta":["January 2013","Conference: Signal Processing: Algorithms, Architectures, Arrangements, and Applications (SPA), 2013"],"references":["6346613_Musical_Theater_and_Opera_Singing-Why_So_Different_A_Study_of_Subglottal_Pressure_Voice_Source_and_Formant_Frequency_Characteristics","285491436_Audio_database_for_the_as_sessment_of_singing_voice_quality_of_choir_members","22314239_The_Acoustics_of_the_Singing_Voice","22260751_Acoustic_properties_of_voice_timbre_types_and_their_influence_on_voice_classification","19458505_Acoustical_analysis_of_the_underlying_voice_differences_between_two_groups_of_professional_singers_Opera_and_country_and_western","12856564_Formant_frequencies_in_country_singers'_speech_and_singing","11772077_Comparison_of_Singer's_Formant_Speaker's_Ring_and_LTA_Spectrum_Among_Classical_Singers_and_Untrained_Normal_Speakers"]}
