Models exist for other fields than dentistry. They have been compared to 3-point bending test experimental results for yield stress, flexural modulus and flexural strength.\n\nMethods: \nFive formulations of the same experimental material were made. They were composed of an organic matrix and different ratios of silanated barium glass particles. The samples were stored in distilled water for 24h at 37°C prior to the 3-point bending test. The Turcsányi model for yield stress was notably investigated, and SEM was used to complete data analysis.\n\nResults: \nThe yield stress showed reproducible results and a good fit with Turcsányi model with respect to filler ratio. The flexural modulus data are not scattered but did not fit with the existing models. No trend could emerge for flexural strength and strain because of scattering; these properties are more unpredictable. The SEM observations of fracture areas confirm a good matrix-filler interface quality.\n\nSignificance: \nSEM pictures validated the numerical parameter obtained from Turcsányi model. The latter therefore seems to be applicable to dental composites. Firstly, it enables to predict the evolution of the material yield stress without testing all filler ratios. Secondly, this model provides a good way to get micro-information on the matrix-filler interface from macroscopic tests. The discrepancy between flexural modulus results and theory highlighted the necessity to include an \"interface quality\" parameter in accurate predictive models.","authors":["Yoan Bousses","Nathalie Brulat-Bouchard","Pierre-Olivier Bouchard","Hazem Abouelleil"],"meta":["November 2019Dental materials: official publication of the Academy of Dental Materials 36(1)","DOI:10.1016/j.dental.2019.10.012"],"references":["317282963_Academy_of_Dental_Materials_guidance-Resin_composites_Part_I-Mechanical_properties","311701349_Laboratory_mechanical_parameters_of_composite_resins_and_their_relation_to_fractures_and_wear_in_clinical_trials-A_systematic_review","305336344_Effects_of_Different_Temperatures_and_Storage_Time_on_the_Degree_of_Conversion_and_Microhardness_of_Resin-based_Composites","304188212_Physical_characterization_of_unfilled_and_nanofilled_dental_resins_Static_versus_dynamic_mechanical_properties","224053024_The_effect_of_one-step_and_multi-step_polishing_systems_on_the_surface_roughness_and_microhardness_of_novel_resin_composites","45692776_Estimation_of_Elastic_Moduli_of_Particulate_Composites_by_New_Models_and_Comparison_with_Moduli_Measured_by_Tension_Dynamic_and_Ultrasonic_Tests","20518495_Mechanical_properties_and_filler_fraction_of_dental_composite","330972949_Polymer_and_Ceramic_Composite_Materials_Emergent_Properties_and_Applications","304006253_Thermocycling_effect_on_mechanical_and_tribological_characterization_of_two_indirect_dental_restorative_materials","281608509_Effects_of_nanoparticle_size_and_content_on_mechanical_properties_of_dental_nanocomposites_experimental_versus_modeling","260216769_Are_linear_elastic_material_properties_relevant_predictors_of_the_cyclic_fatigue_resistance_of_dental_resin_composites","248250633_Prediction_of_tensile_yield_strength_of_rigid_inorganic_particulate_filled_thermoplastic_composites","229325358_Resin-based_composite_performance_Are_there_some_things_we_can't_predict","227669549_The_Effect_of_Low-Filler_Volume_Fraction_on_the_Elastic_Modulus_and_Thermal_Expansion_Coefficient_of_Particulate_Composites_Simulated_by_a_Multiphase_Model","225926596_Composition_dependence_of_tensile_yield_stress_in_filled_polymers","50270477_BisGMA_TEGDMA_ratio_and_filler_content_effects_on_shrinkage_stress","50251363_Fracture_toughness_of_dental_restorative_materials","41759613_Investigating_filler_morphology_and_mechanical_properties_of_new_low-shrinkage_resin_composite_types","16599186_Physical_and_mechanical_properties_of_dental_composites","13496898_In_vitro_aging_of_dental_composites_in_water_-_Effect_of_degree_of_conversion_filler_volume_and_fillermatrix_coupling","10864576_Shear_punch_strength_and_flexural_strength_of_model_composites_with_varying_filler_volume_fraction_particle_size_and_silanation","10764747_Flexural_fatigue_behavior_of_resin_composite_dental_restoratives","8409648_Effects_of_strain_rate_and_temperature_on_the_mechanical_properties_of_resin_composites","8364243_Effect_of_thermal_cycling_on_whisker-reinforced_dental_resin_composites","6197355_The_effect_of_temperature_on_the_viscoelastic_properties_of_nano-hybrid_composites","5225067_Effect_of_filler_size_and_shape_on_local_nanoindentation_modulus_of_resin-composites"]}
