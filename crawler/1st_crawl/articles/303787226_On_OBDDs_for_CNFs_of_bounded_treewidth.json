{"id":"303787226_On_OBDDs_for_CNFs_of_bounded_treewidth","abstract":"In this paper we show that a CNF cannot be compiled into an Ordered Binary Decision Diagram (OBDD) of fixed-parameter size parameterized by the primal graph treewidth of the input CNF. Thus we provide a parameterized separation between OBDDs and Sentential Decision Diagrams for which such fixed-parameter compilation is possible. We also show that the best existing parameterized upper bound for OBDDs in fact holds for the incidence graph treewidth parameterization.","authors":["Igor Razgon"],"meta":["January 2014"],"references":[]}
