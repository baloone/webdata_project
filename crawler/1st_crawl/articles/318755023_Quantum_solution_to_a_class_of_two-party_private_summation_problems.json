{"id":"318755023_Quantum_solution_to_a_class_of_two-party_private_summation_problems","abstract":"In this paper, we define a class of special two-party private summation (S2PPS) problems and present a common quantum solution to S2PPS problems. Compared to related classical solutions, our solution has advantages of higher security and lower communication complexity, and especially it can ensure the fairness of two parties without the help of a third party. Furthermore, we investigate the practical applications of our proposed S2PPS protocol in many privacy-preserving settings with big data sets, including private similarity decision, anonymous authentication, social networks, secure trade negotiation, secure data mining.","authors":["Run-hua Shi","Shun Zhang"],"meta":["July 2017Quantum Information Processing 16(9)","DOI:10.1007/s11128-017-1676-x"],"references":["306085393_Hybrid_threshold_adaptable_quantum_secret_sharing_scheme_with_reverse_Huffman-Fibonacci-tree_coding","291420684_Secure_Multiparty_Quantum_Computation_for_Summation_and_Multiplication","284172476_A_generalized_architecture_of_quantum_secure_direct_communication_for_N_disjointed_users_with_authentication","273786350_Security_of_quantum_digital_signatures_for_classical_messages","316806154_Probabilistic_and_Statistical_Aspects_of_Quantum_Theory","314829083_Secure_multi-party_quantum_computation","307796260_Secure_and_Efficient_Private_Set_Intersection_Cardinality_Using_Bloom_Filter","301279477_Practical_quantum_private_query_with_better_performance_in_resisting_joint-measurement_attack","282951983_QKD-based_quantum_private_query_without_a_failure_probability","281367538_Quantum_oblivious_set-member_decision_protocol","268525365_A_quantum_approach_to_homomorphic_encryption","265416495_A_Random_Decision_Tree_Framework_for_Privacy-Preserving_Data_Mining","267024131_Fast_and_Private_Computation_of_Cardinality_of_Set_Intersection_and_Union","262840996_Postprocessing_of_the_Oblivious_Key_in_Quantum_Private_Query","262305147_A_communication-efficient_private_matching_scheme_in_Client-Server_model"]}
