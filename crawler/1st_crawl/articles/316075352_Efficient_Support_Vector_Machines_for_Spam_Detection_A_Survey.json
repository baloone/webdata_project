{"id":"316075352_Efficient_Support_Vector_Machines_for_Spam_Detection_A_Survey","abstract":"Nowadays, the increase volume of spam has been annoying for the internet users. Spam is commonly defined as unsolicited email messages, and the goal of spam detection is to distinguish between spam and legitimate email messages. Most of the spam can contain viruses, Trojan horses or other harmful software that may lead to failures in computers and networks, consumes network bandwidth and storage space and slows down email servers. In addition it provides a medium for distributing harmful code and/or offensive content and there is not any complete solution for this problem, then the necessity of effective spam filters increase. In the recent years, the usability of machine learning techniques for automatic filtering of spam can be seen. Support Vector Machines (SVM) is a powerful, state-of-the-art algorithm in machine learning that is a good option to classify spam from email. In this article, we consider the evaluation criterions of SVM for spam detection and filtering.","authors":["Zahra S. Torabi","Mohammad H.
