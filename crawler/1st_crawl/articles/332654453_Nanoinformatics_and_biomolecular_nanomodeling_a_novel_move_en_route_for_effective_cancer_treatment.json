{"id":"332654453_Nanoinformatics_and_biomolecular_nanomodeling_a_novel_move_en_route_for_effective_cancer_treatment","abstract":"Empowering role of nanoinformatics in design and elucidation of nanoparticles for effective cancer treatment has made this field a fascinating area for researchers, inspiring them to enhance up the quality and efficacy of existing anticancer medicines. Theoretical and computational modeling is being seen as a forefront solution for problems related to surface chemistry, optimized geometry, or other properties in nanoparticle designing and drug delivery. The current review aims to acquaint with the insight story of the incubation of in silico tools and techniques in nanotechnology to develop better anticancer nanomedicines. The review also recapitulates the assets and liabilities of this field and present an outline of existing inventiveness and endeavors of nanoinformatics. We propose how nanoinformatics could hasten up the advancements in anticancer nanomedicines through use of computational tools, nanoparticles repositories & various modeling and simulation methods.","authors":["Neha Sharma","Mala Sharma","Qazi Mohammad Sajid Jamal","Mohammad A.
