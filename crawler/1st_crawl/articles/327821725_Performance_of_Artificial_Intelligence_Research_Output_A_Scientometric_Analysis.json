The summary of this study is to present the preliminary results of a research in progress regarding the subject of artificial intelligence. The period of study was taken from 1981 to 2010. Based on this analysis the following results were concluded; it is conjecture that the research productivity on Artificial Intelligence exhibits a gradual growth from 2006 to 2010. It is inferred that the dominating source in the form of journal articles compared to the other sources. English is generally the medium of research communication, for it is widely recognized all over the world. The collection is exported to HistCite to obtain a large list of 10,795 articles and 10,37,707 times cited references along with their local and global citation scores (LCS and GCS). It is found that the mean growth rate is 0.16 and the mean doubling time for the research output on Artificial Intelligence research is 9.71 years.","authors":["M Gunasekaran Librarian","Shanmugam a P"],"meta":["March 2015"],"references":["239569965_Scientometric_mapping_of_Tsunami_publications_A_citation_based_study","220365376_Editorial_Triple_Helix_and_innovation_in_Asia_using_scientometrics_webometrics_and_informetrics","220364932_Communication_and_collaborative_research_pattern_of_Sivaraj_Ramaseshan_A_scientometric_portrait","242915745_Scientometric_analysis_of_the_research_activities_of_chemists_from_the_Rugjer_Boskovic_Institute_Yugoslavia_1976-1985","222764425_The_Relative_Importance_of_Journals_Used_in_Operations_Management_Research"]}
