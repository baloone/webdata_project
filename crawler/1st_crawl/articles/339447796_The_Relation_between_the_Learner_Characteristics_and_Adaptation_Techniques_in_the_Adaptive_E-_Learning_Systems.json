{"id":"339447796_The_Relation_between_the_Learner_Characteristics_and_Adaptation_Techniques_in_the_Adaptive_E-_Learning_Systems","abstract":"E-learning systems play a major role in facilitating the process of interaction between teachers and learners and enhance their relation through minimizing the effects of temporal or spatial limitations. Although the number of learners at universities is getting higher, the number of available learning materials in the web, and the different learners' characteristics(LCs) in the term of needs make the traditional e-learning systems more limited. Recently, adaptive e-learning systems (AES) are required to satisfy the needs of the individual learner. A lot of Algorithms have been integrated in order to define the learner models, determine what learner needs, adapt navigation support, and personalize the learning format. The aim of this paper is to explore the LCs used by the developed AES to draw conclusions about their relation with the adaptation techniques they use. More over it aims to explain the rule for selecting the LCs used by the AES.","authors":["Alber shawky Aziz","Shereen Taie","Reda El-Khoribi"],"meta":["February 2020","DOI:10.1109/ITCE48509.2020.9047766","Conference: ITCE 2020At: aswan, egypt","Project: adaptive e-learning"],"references":["334777246_Personalization_of_learning_activities_within_a_virtual_environment_for_training_based_on_fuzzy_logic_theory","334758764_An_Adaptive_Feedback_System_to_Improve_Student_Performance_Based_on_Collaborative_Behavior","327296427_SCORMAdaptiveQuiz_Implementation_of_Adaptive_e-Learning_for_Moodle","325801511_Optimizing_Dynamic_Multi-Agent_Performance_in_E-Learning_Environment","318308464_The_Model_of_Adaptive_Learning_Objects_for_virtual_environments_instanced_by_the_competencies","348187449_The_Role_of_Learner_Characteristics_in_the_Adaptive_Educational_Hypermedia_Systems_The_Case_of_the_MATHEMA","335543522_Learning_Analytics_Framework_for_Adaptive_E-learning_System_to_Monitor_the_Learner's_Activities","323733683_SMART_Education_Framework_for_Adaptation_Content_Presentation","321755731_Hybrid_Fuzzy_Recommendation_System_for_Enhanced_E-learning","320148067_An_Enhanced_Learning_Style_Index_Implementation_and_Integration_into_an_Intelligent_and_Adaptive_e-Learning_System"]}
