{"id":"262071534_The_Average_Representation_-_A_Cornucopia_of_Power_Indices","abstract":"For the classical power indices there is a disproportion between power and\nrelative weights, in general. We introduce two new indices, based on weighted\nrepresentations, which are proportional to suitable relative weights and which\nalso share several important properties of the classical power indices.\nImposing further restrictions on the set of representations may lead to a whole\nfamily of such indices.","authors":["Serguei Kaniovski","Sascha Kurz"],"meta":["May 2014SSRN Electronic Journal","DOI:10.2139/ssrn.2432878","SourcearXiv","Project: Decision theory and voting"],"references":["259128345_The_minimum_sum_representation_as_an_index_of_voting_power","257246671_The_nucleolus_of_large_majority_games","240698416_The_Paradox_of_Coalition_Trading","256044449_The_Geometry_of_Voting_Power_Weighted_Voting_and_Hyper--Ellipsoids","220696154_Computational_Aspects_of_Cooperative_Game_Theory","220691358_Simple_Games_Desirability_Relations_Trading_Pseudoweightings"]}
