{"id":"331679175_The_development_of_artificial_intelligence_a_bibliometric_analysis_2007-2016","abstract":"The aim of this study is to research the development of artificial intelligence in bibliometrics perspective. Bibliometrics, as one sub-field of scientometric, is an effective tool to evaluating research trends in different fields. The total number of 1188 publications between 1st January 2007 to 31, December 2016 was identified from an academic database Web of Science. In this study, yearly research output, distribution of publication by countries, most productive publication institutions, most productive authors, distribution of research field, artificial intelligence-related researches were analyzed based on bibliometrics. This study tries to provide a valuable reference for researchers to understand the development of artificial intelligence in multiple perspectives.","authors":["Yufei Lei","Zhongbao Liu"],"meta":["February 2019Journal of Physics Conference Series 1168(2):022027","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/1168/2/022027"],"references":["314139647_Heading_toward_Artificial_Intelligence_20","267105576_Advances_of_flexible_pressure_sensors_toward_artificial_intelligence_and_health_care_applications","262752403_Development_of_Carbon-based_Nanomaterials_Indicators_Using_the_Analytical_Tools_and_Data_Provided_by_the_Web_of_Science_Database","257662861_State_of_the_Art_on_the_Systems_of_Innovation_Research_A_Bibliometrics_Study_up_to_2009","224118307_A_Survey_of_Artificial_Intelligence_for_Cognitive_Radios","254004046_Putting_the_'Smarts'_into_the_Smart_Grid_A_Grand_Challenge_for_Artificial_Intelligence","251507263_Forecasting_daily_lake_levels_using_artificial_intelligence_approaches","235352870_Research_status_and_characteristics_of_library_and_information_science_in_Taiwan_A_bibliometric_analysis","224183837_Deep_Machine_Learning_-_A_New_Frontier_in_Artificial_Intelligence_Research_Research_Frontier","223306059_A_Comparison_of_Performance_of_Several_Artificial_Intelligence_Methods_for_Forecasting_Monthly_Discharge_Time_Series"]}
