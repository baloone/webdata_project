{"id":"328599736_Statistical_relationships_between_corresponding_authorship_international_co-authorship_and_citation_impact_of_national_research_systems","abstract":"This paper presents a statistical analysis of the relationship between three science indicators applied in earlier bibliometric studies, namely research leadership based on corresponding authorship, international collaboration using international co-authorship data, and field-normalized citation impact. Indicators at the level of countries are extracted from the SIR database created by SCImago Research Group from publication records indexed for Elsevier's Scopus. The relationship between authorship and citation-based indicators is found to be complex, as it reflects a country's phase of scientific development and the coverage policy of the database. Moreover, one should distinguish a genuine leadership effect from a purely statistical effect due to fractional counting. Further analyses at the level of institutions and qualitative validation studies are recommended.","authors":["Felix de Moya-Anegon","Vicente P. Guerrero-Bote","Carmen LÃ³pez-Illescas","Henk F.
