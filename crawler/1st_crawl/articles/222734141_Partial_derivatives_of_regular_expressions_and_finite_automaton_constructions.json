{"id":"222734141_Partial_derivatives_of_regular_expressions_and_finite_automaton_constructions","abstract":"We introduce a notion of partial derivative of a regular expression and apply it to finite automaton constructions. The notion is a generalization of the known notion of word derivative due to Brzozowski: partial derivatives are related to non-deterministic finite automata (NFA's) in the same natural way as derivatives are related to deterministic ones (DFA's). We give a constructive definition of partial derivatives and prove several facts, in particular: 1.(1) any derivative of a regular expression r can be represented by a finite set of partial derivatives of r;2.(2) the set of all partial derivatives of r is finite and its cardinality is less than or equal to one plus the number of occurrences of letters from A appearing in r;3.(3) any partial derivative of r is either a regular unit, or a subterm of r, or a concatenation of several such subterms.\nThese theoretical results lead us to a new algorithm for turning regular expressions into relatively small NFA's and allow us to provide certain improvements to Brzozowski's algorithm for constructing DFA's. We also report on a prototype implementation of our NFA construction and present several examples.","authors":["Valentin Antimirov"],"meta":["March 1996Theoretical Computer Science 155(2):291-319","DOI:10.1016/0304-3975(95)00182-4","SourceDBLP"],"references":["268548665_A_symbolic_calculus_of_regular_expressions","230876408_Finite_Automata_and_Their_Decision_Problems","225793725_The_complexity_of_testing_ground_reducibility_for_linear_word_rewriting_systems_with_variables","220999588_On_ground_reducibility_problem_for_word_rewriting_systems_with_variables","2781981_A_Taxonomy_of_Finite_Automata_Construction_Algorithms","267439070_Finite_Automata","266189465_Parsing_theory_Vol_I_Languages_and_parsing","263914626_Differentiation_of_K-rational_expressions","263561067_Rewriting_extended_regular_expressions","263561065_Rewriting_extended_regular_expressions","253068166_The_Abstract_Theory_of_Automata","242552512_Finite_Automata_and_Representation_of_Events","242367012_Regular_Algebra_and_Finite_Machines","238712074_On_defining_relations_for_the_algebra_of_regular_events","234784463_Programming_Techniques_Regular_expression_search_algorithm","229124581_Linear_Automaton_Transformations","228057764_Introduction_To_Automata_Theory_Languages_And_Computation","226520486_From_regular_expressions_to_DFA's_using_compressed_NFA's","225810832_Rewriting_regular_inequalities","225222143_Finite_automata_and_rational_languages_an_introduction","224583682_Regular_Expressions_and_State_Graphs_for_Automata","222452422_Rewriting_Extended_Regular_Expressions","221313897_From_regular_expressions_to_DFA's_using_compressed_NFA's","220994580_Partial_Derivates_of_Regular_Expressions_and_Finite_Automata_Constructions","220980282_Regular_Expressions_into_Finite_Automata","220458000_Finite_State_Automata_from_Regular_Expression_Trees","220431304_A_Procedure_for_Checking_Equality_of_Regular_Expressions","220430648_Derivatives_of_Regular_Expressions","220421762_Regular_Expression_Search_Algorithm","220162054_Complexity_of_Matching_Problems","220155729_On_Equations_for_Regular_Languages_Finite_Automata_and_Sequential_Networks","220153493_Order-Sorted_Algebra_I_Equational_Deduction_for_Multiple_Inheritance_Overloading_Exceptions_and_Partial_Operations","44127630_From_Regular_Expressions_to_Deterministic_Automata"]}
