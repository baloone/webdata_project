{"id":"224253142_MobiSense_Power-efficient_micro-mobility_in_wireless_sensor_networks","abstract":"Emerging applications in industrial automation as well as tracking and monitoring applications of humans, objects or animals share common requirements: micro-mobility, high-throughput, and two-way end-to-end communications. In this paper we present MobiSense, a MAC layer and routing architecture for micro-mobility environments providing reliable and energy-efficient communication and low-latency handoffs. MobiSense's energy-efficiency and reliability comes from a set of carefully chosen design elements: rapid network information gathering, rapid network (re)admission and convergence, distributed network formation, and dynamic scheduling. Testbed evaluations show that a mobile sensor achieves: (i) reliability above 95% even in scenarios with high data rates of 6pps/node; (ii) low latency-handoffs typically below 1 second; (iii) a high aggregate system throughput of more than 95kbps; (iv) two-way communication without the need for flooding; and (v) communication at very low duty-cycles below 4% at 6pps/node.","authors":["Antonio Gonga","Olaf Landsiedel","Mikael Johansson"],"meta":["July 2011","DOI:10.1109/DCOSS.2011.5982172","SourceIEEE Xplore","Conference: Distributed Computing in Sensor Systems and Workshops (DCOSS), 2011 International Conference on"],"references":["228555393_TSMP_Time_synchronized_mesh_protocol","228412596_A_Data_Delivery_Mechanism_to_Support_Mobile_Users_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","224762059_Animal_Behaviour_Understanding_using_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","312372159_Sink_mobility_in_wireless_sensor_networks_When_theory_meets_reality","241962179_Underground_coal_mine_monitoring_with_wireless_sensor_networks_-_article_no_10","232641275_Cross-level_sensor_network_simulation_with_COOJA","232629551_Plant_Running_Management_Based_on_Wireless_Sensor_Network","224414808_Sink_mobility_in_wireless_sensor_networks_When_theory_meets_reality","224311458_Realistic_and_Efficient_Multi-Channel_Communications_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","222650280_MC-LMAC_A_multi-channel_MAC_protocol_for_wireless_sensor_networks","221243739_MMSN_Multi-Frequency_Media_Access_Control_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","221091782_Collection_Tree_Protocol","221435011_Design_and_Implementation_of_Wireless_Sensor_Based-Monitoring_System_for_Smart_Factory","221191533_A_Novel_Model_for_User_Mobility_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","221091809_Understanding_the_causes_of_packet_delivery_success_and_failure_in_dense_wireless_sensor_networks"]}
