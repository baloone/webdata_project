{"id":"2381440_Circuits_for_Integer_Factorization_A_Proposal","abstract":"The number eld sieve takes time L 1:901+o(1) on a generalpurpose computer with L 0:950+o(1) bits of memory; here L is a particular subexponential function of the input size. It takes the same time on a parallel trial-division machine, such as Cracker or TWINKLE, of size L 0:950+o(1) . It takes time only L 1:185+o(1) on a machine of size L 0:790+o(1) explained in this paper. This reduction of total cost from L 2:852+o(1) to L 1:976+o(1) means that a ((3:009 +o(1))d)-digit factorization with the new machine has the same cost as a d-digit factorization with previous machines. 0. Preface This paper is an excerpt from a grant proposal that I submitted to NSF DMS at the beginning of October 2001. The same techniques can be applied to other congruence-combination algorithms for factoring, discrete logarithms, class groups, etc. See [3] for a bibliography. Priority dates. I realized on 13 September 2000 that special-purpose hardware would change the exponent in the cost of integer factorization. I announced the exponent reduction from 3+o(1) to 2:5 +o(1) for real (two-dimensional) circuits in a seminar at Butler University on 23 March 2001, a rump-session presentation at Eurocrypt 2001 on 7 May 2001, and a talk at the Algorithms and Number Theory conference at Dagstuhl on 14 May 2001. I realized on 9 August 2001 that the sieving exponent could easily be reduced from 2:5 + o(1) to 2 + o(1). 1.","authors":["Daniel J.
