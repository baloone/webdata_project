{"id":"271012528_Ethno-Religious_Differences_in_Israeli_Higher_Education_Vertical_and_Horizontal_Dimensions","abstract":"The worldwide expansion and diversification of higher education systems has sparked growing interest in\nthe stratification of students according to higher education institution and field of study. This article\nfocuses on Israel, where higher education has experienced significant expansion and diversification during\nthe past two decades. Using generalized ordered logistic regression models, the study analyses vertical\nand horizontal ethno-religious inequality. The findings indicate that Ashkenazim, the privileged Jewish\ngroup, remain the most advantaged regarding enrollment in higher education, but their advantage over\nother veteran Jewish groups is mainly owing to areas of specialization in high school and achievement on\nthe tests that serve as admission criteria to the higher education institutions. Among the enrollees, controlling\nfor high school history reveals that the disadvantaged Jewish groups, Mizrachim and new immigrants,\nhave higher odds than Ashkenazim of enrolling in lucrative programmes. Muslim, Druze, and\nChristian Arabs are disadvantaged regarding both the vertical (access) and horizontal (fields of study) dimensions, regardless of high school history and previous achievements.","authors":["Yariv Feniger","Oded Mcdossi","Hanna Ayalon"],"meta":["December 2014European Sociological Review 31(4)","DOI:10.1093/esr/jcu092"],"references":["276196708_Access_Without_Equity_Longitudinal_Analyses_of_Institutional_Stratification_by_Race_and_Ethnicity_1972-2004","275143780_Stratification_in_Higher_Education_and_Its_Relationship_with_Social_Inequality_A_Comparative_Study_of_11_European_Countries","268506077_Emigration_for_Higher_Education_The_Case_of_Palestinians_Living_in_Israel_Studying_in_Jordan","265080860_Why_the_Difference_A_Closer_Look_at_Higher_Education_Minority_Ethnic_Students_and_Graduates","263722366_'I_don't_want_to_see_it'_Decoupling_ethnicity_and_class_from_social_structure_in_Jewish_Israeli_high_schools","249802925_Educational_Reforms_and_Inequalities_in_Israel_The_MMI_Hypothesis_Revisited","249795304_Mathematics_and_Sciences_Course_Taking_Among_Arab_Students_in_Israel_A_Case_of_Unexpected_Gender_Equality","249399909_Nonhierarchical_Curriculum_Differentiation_and_Inequality_in_Achievement_A_Different_Story_or_More_of_the_Same","249285723_Occupational_and_Economic_Attainments_of_College_and_University_Graduates_in_Israel","236862160_Jewish_Ethnicity_and_Educational_Opportunities_in_Israel_Evidence_from_a_Curricular_Reform","233704028_Stratification_and_Diversity_in_the_Expanded_System_of_Higher_Education_In_Israel","233559498_Separate_and_unequal_The_role_of_the_state_educational_system_in_maintaining_the_subordination_of_Israel's_Palestinian_Arab_citizens","228981051_Field_of_Study_and_Students'_Stratification_in_an_Expanded_System_of_Higher_Education_The_Case_of_Israel","228173900_Horizontal_Stratification_in_Postsecondary_Education_Forms_Explanations_and_Implications","227277804_Women_and_Men_Go_to_University_Mathematical_Background_and_Gender_Differences_in_Choice_of_Field_in_Higher_Education","225399414_Expansion_differentiation_and_the_persistence_of_social_class_inequalities_in_British_higher_education","24096684_Generalized_Ordered_LogitPartial_Proportional_Odds_Models_for_Ordinal_Dependent_Variables","7767740_On_Class_Differentials_in_Educational_Attainment","330962376_Stratification_in_Israel_Class_Ethnicity_and_Gender","313406750_Fields_of_study_college_selectivity_and_student_inequalities","285131437_The_status_of_the_Palestinians_in_Israel_A_double_periphery_in_an_ethno-national_state","281453157_Effectively_Maintained_Inequality_Education_Transitions_Track_Mobility_and_Social_Background_Effects","281453103_Education_Opportunity_Social_Inequality","272581460_Local_Labor_Markets_Ethnic_Segregation_and_Income_Inequality","271748332_Segregation_Tracking_and_the_Educational_Attainment_of_Minorities_Arabs_and_Oriental_Jews_in_Israel","258188692_Ethnic_Inequality_in_Choice-driven_Education_Systems_A_Longitudinal_Study_of_Performance_and_Choice_in_England_and_Sweden","254326072_Bold_choices_How_ethnic_inequalities_in_educational_attainment_are_suppressed","252850986_Tracking_and_Inequality_New_Directions_for_Research_and_Practice","251172544_Ultra-OrthodoxHaredi_Education","249705006_Stratification_Theory_Socioeconomic_Background_and_Educational_Attainment_A_Formal_Analysis","247477602_Sample_Selection_Bias_Specification_Error","247378458_Regression_Models_for_Categorical_Dependent_Variables_Using_Stata","240727480_Higher_Education_Entry_of_Turkish_Immigrant_Youth_in_Germany","234838564_Racial_And_Ethnic_Stratification_in_Educational_Achievement_and_Attainment","233177699_Second-generation_Jewish_immigrants_in_Israel_Have_the_ethnic_gaps_in_schooling_and_earnings_declined","226594203_University_Education_Credentialism_and_Social_Stratification_Among_Palestinian_Arabs_in_Israel","222684407_Social_Mobility_and_the_Educational_Choices_of_Asian_Americans","221894129_Education_Policy_and_Equality_Some_Evidence_from_Europe","215058954_Effectively_Maintained_Inequality_Education_Transitions_Track_Mobility_and_Social_Background_Effects1","44833010_Higher_Education_among_the_Arabs_in_Israel_Formal_Policy_between_Empowerment_and_Control","44823066_Education_Empowerment_and_Control_The_Case_of_the_Arabs_in_Israel","40421941_Stratification_in_Higher_Education_A_Comparative_Study","26260537_Parental_education_children's_performance_and_the_transition_to_higher_secondary_education_Trends_in_primary_and_secondary_effects_over_five_Dutch_school_cohorts_1965-99","4814130_Sample_Selection_Bias_As_A_Specification_Error","2932339_Ethnicity_and_Mixed_Ethnicity_Educational_Gaps_among_Israeli-born_Jews"]}
