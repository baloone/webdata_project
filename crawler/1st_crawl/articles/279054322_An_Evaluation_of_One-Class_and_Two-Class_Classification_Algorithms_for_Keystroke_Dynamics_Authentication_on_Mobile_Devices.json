{"id":"279054322_An_Evaluation_of_One-Class_and_Two-Class_Classification_Algorithms_for_Keystroke_Dynamics_Authentication_on_Mobile_Devices","abstract":"In this paper we study keystroke dynamics as an authentication mechanism for touchscreen based devices. The authentication process decides whether the identity of a given person is accepted or rejected. This can be easily implemented by using a two-class classifier which operates with the help of positive samples (belonging to the authentic person) and negative ones. However, collecting negative samples is not always a viable option. In such cases a one-class classification algorithm can be used to characterize the target class and distinguish it from the outliers. We implemented an authentication test-framework that is capable of working with both one-class and two-class classification algorithms. The framework was evaluated on our dataset containing keystroke samples from 42 users, collected from touchscreen-based Android devices. Experimental results yield an Equal Error Rate (EER) of 3% (two-class) and 7% (one-class) respectively.","authors":["Margit Antal","Laszlo Zsolt Szabo"],"meta":["May 2015","DOI:10.1109/CSCS.2015.16","Conference: CSCS20"],"references":["303637188_The_det_curve_in_assessment_of_detection_task_performance","280313088_Feature_Fusion_Approach_on_Keystroke_Dynamics_Efficiency_Enhancement","269310155_Putting_'pressure'_on_mobile_authentication","266374572_Keystroke_Dynamics_on_Android_Platform","262566867_A_Study_of_Cross-Validation_and_Bootstrap_for_Accuracy_Estimation_and_Model_Selection","259589152_Keystroke_Dynamics_in_the_pre-Touchscreen_Era","259115430_A_Survey_of_Keystroke_Dynamics_Biometrics","257365156_Keystroke_Dynamics_Authentication","222511520_Introduction_to_ROC_analysis","221485049_The_DET_curve_in_assessment_of_decision_task_performance","220565847_Anomaly_Detection_A_Survey","220017784_Data_Mining_Practical_Machine_Learning_Tools_and_Techniques","45884905_Keystroke_Dynamics_Authentication_For_Collaborative_Systems","2352264_A_Study_of_Cross-Validation_and_Bootstrap_for_Accuracy_Estimation_and_Model_Selection","310479970_Authenticating_user_using_keystroke_dynamics_and_finger_pressure","303006123_Authentication_with_keystroke_dynamics_on_touchscreen_keypads-effect_of_different_n-graph_combinations","302992045_Keystroke_dynamics_on_Android_platform","289108344_KeySens_Passive_User_Authentication_through_Micro-behavior_Modeling_of_Soft_Keyboard_Interaction","285334632_Biometric_Authentication_and_Identification_Using_Keystroke_Dynamics_A_Survey","283360488_Towards_continuous_and_passive_authentication_via_touch_biometrics_An_experimental_study_on_smartphones","282756342_You_Are_How_You_Touch_User_Verification_on_Smartphones_via_Tapping_Behaviors","277636811_Keystroke_dynamics-based_user_authentication_using_long_and_free_text_strings_from_various_input_devices","263672351_Introducing_touchstroke_Keystroke-based_authentication_system_for_smartphones","247053706_One-Class_Classification_Concept-Learning_In_The_Absence_Of_Counter-Examples","224385908_Authenticating_User_Using_Keystroke_Dynamics_and_Finger_Pressure","221900847_Data_Mining_Practical_Machine_Learning_Tools_And_Techniques"]}
