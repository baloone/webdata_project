{"id":"323645710_The_Single-Peaked_Domain_Revisited_A_Simple_Global_Characterization","abstract":"It is proved that, among all restricted preference domains that guarantee consistency (i.e. transitivity) of pairwise majority voting, the single-peaked domain is the only minimally rich and connected domain that contains two completely reversed strict preference orders. It is argued that this result explains the predominant role of single-peakedness as a domain restriction in models of political economy and elsewhere. The main result has a number of corollaries, among them a dual characterization of the single-dipped domain; it also implies that a single-crossing (‘order-restricted’) domain can be minimally rich only if it is a subdomain of a single-peaked domain. The conclusions are robust as the results apply both to domains of strict and of weak preference orders, respectively.","authors":["Clemens Puppe"],"meta":["March 2018Journal of Economic Theory 176","DOI:10.1016/j.jet.2018.03.003"],"references":["325697777_On_single-peaked_domains_and_min-max_rules","282775058_Preference_exclusions_for_social_rationality","281761921_Unanimity_overruled_Majority_voting_and_the_burden_of_history"]}
