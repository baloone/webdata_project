{"id":"290111155_Reality_of_the_Division_by_Zero_z0_0","abstract":"In this paper, we will give some clear evidences of the reality of the division by zero z/0 = 0 with a fundamental algebraic theorem, and physical and geometrical examples; that is, 1) a field structure containing the division by zero, 2) by the gradient of the y axis on the (x, y) plane, 3) by the reflection 1/z of z with respect to the unit circle with center at the origin on the complex z plane, and 4) by considering rotation of a right circle cone having some very interesting phenomenon from some practical and physical problem.","authors":["Hiroshi Michiwaki","S.
