{"id":"273038150_Text_Mining_Techniques_and_its_Application","abstract":"Text mining has become an exciting research field as it tries to discover valuable information from unstructured texts. The unstructured texts which contain vast amount of information cannot simply be used for further processing by computers. Therefore, exact processing methods, algorithms and techniques are vital in order to extract this valuable information which is completed by using text mining. In this paper, we have discussed general idea of text mining and comparison of its techniques. In addition, we briefly discuss a number of text mining applications which are used presently and in future.","authors":["Shilpa Dang"],"meta":["December 2014"],"references":["352399012_Text_Mining_Process_Techniques_and_Tools_an_Overview","326625687_A_detailed_study_on_text_mining_techniques","261877235_Techniq_TechnTechn_Techniques_Applications_and_Challenging_Issue_in_Text_Mining","42802926_A_Survey_of_Text_Mining_Techniques_and_Applications","275347413_Text_mining_A_Brief_Survey","267245960_A_Survey_of_Text_Mining_Retrieval_Extraction_and_Indexing_Techniques"]}
