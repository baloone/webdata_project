Using a French corpus of scientific articles in humanities and social sciences (Scientext), we have collected and modelized lexicosyntactic patterns for the verb montrer and two of its synonyms. We aim at extracting specific structures for those three semantically close verbs, assuming that their semantic proximity will also be revealed in similar syntactic properties. We thus create a set of verbal patterns, with cooccurrence informations, to combine them to a tool designed to help L2 learners in their scientific writing.","authors":["Rui Yan","Sylvain Hatier"],"meta":["April 2016","DOI:10.13092/lo.78.2952"],"references":[]}
