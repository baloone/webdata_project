{"id":"330801787_Evolution_of_Internet_of_Things_IoT_and_its_significant_impact_in_the_field_of_Precision_Agriculture","abstract":"During recent years, one of the most familiar name scaling new heights and creating a benchmark is Internet of Things (IoT). It is indeed the future of communication that has transformed Things (Objects) of the real world into smarter devices. The functional aspect of IoT is to unite every object of the world in such a manner that humans have the ability to control them via Internet. Furthermore, these objects also provide regular as well as timely updates on their current status to its end user. Although IoT concepts were proposed a couple of years ago, it may not be incorrect to quote that this term has become a benchmark for establishing communication among objects. In context to the present standings of IoT, identification of the most prominent applications in the field of IoT have been highlighted and a comprehensive review has been done specifically in the field of Precision Agriculture. This article evaluates contributions made by various researchers and academicians over the past few years. Furthermore, existing challenges faced while performing agricultural activities have been highlighted along with future research directions to equip novel researchers of this domain to assess the current standings of IoT and to further improve upon them with more inspiring and innovative ideas.","authors":["Abhishek Khanna","Sanmeet Kaur"],"meta":["February 2019Computers and Electronics in Agriculture 157(2):218-231","DOI:10.1016/j.compag.2018.12.039"],"references":["327472963_Efficiency_of_Using_Smart-Mobile_Phones_in_Accessing_Agricultural_Information_by_Smallholder_Farmers_in_North_Kordofan_-_Sudan","327415273_Machine_Learning_Applications_on_Agricultural_Datasets_for_Smart_Farm_Enhancement","315835782_Internet_of_things_Security_A_Survey","311520767_Adoption_of_precision_agriculture_technologies_by_German_crop_farmers","309894257_Internet_of_Things_Platform_for_Smart_Farming_Experiences_and_Lessons_Learnt","305627379_Developing_Ubiquitous_Sensor_Network_Platform_Using_Internet_of_Things_Application_in_Precision_Agriculture","297141894_Towards_Internet_of_Things_Survey_and_Future_Vision","286813439_Provisioning_Software-Defined_IoT_Cloud_Systems","282603371_Long-Range_Communications_in_Unlicensed_Bands_the_Rising_Stars_in_the_IoT_and_Smart_City_Scenarios","280527542_Internet_of_Things_IoT_A_Literature_Review","279177017_Internet_of_Things_A_Survey_on_Enabling_Technologies_Protocols_and_Applications","273957469_Secure_Pseudonym-based_Near_Field_Communication_Protocol_for_the_Consumer_Internet_of_Things","271921561_The_Internet_of_Things-A_survey_of_topics_and_trends","268195773_M2M_technologies_Enablers_for_a_pervasive_Internet_of_Things","261311447_Future_Internet_The_Internet_of_Things_Architecture_Possible_Applications_and_Key_Challenges","260285600_The_Glasgow_Raspberry_Pi_Cloud_A_Scale_Model_for_Cloud_Computing_Infrastructures","256461848_The_Internet_of_Things_Vision_Challenges","254032690_RFID_technology_and_its_applications_in_Internet_of_Things_IoT","236627583_Context_Aware_Computing_for_The_Internet_of_Things_A_Survey","227013713_Towards_Natural_Interaction_by_Enabling_Technologies_A_Near_Field_Communication_Approach","224227141_M2M_From_Mobile_to_Embedded_Internet","224208713_Passive_RFID_technology_for_the_Internet_of_Things","224175757_Research_on_the_architecture_of_Internet_of_Things","224173077_The_study_and_application_of_the_IOT_technology_in_agriculture","222571757_The_Internet_of_Things_A_Survey","221609324_The_blocker_tag_Selective_blocking_of_RFID_tags_for_consumer_privacy","221425065_Early_Infrastructure_of_an_Internet_of_Things_in_Spaces_for_Learning","220491250_Building_the_internet_of_things_using_RFID_The_RFID_ecosystem_experience","51890865_Internet_of_Things_Applications_and_Challenges_in_Technology_and_Standardization","316233959_Web_Standards_to_Enable_an_Accessible_and_Inclusive_Internet_of_Things_IoT","309201797_A_software_defined_networking_architecture_for_the_internet-of-things","308017375_On_the_potential_of_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_for_the_in-situ_assessment_of_crop_leaf_area_index","305374431_Internet_of_things_standards_who_stands_out_from_the_crowd","301574140_Millimetre_Wave_Communication_for_5G_IoT_Applications","291951017_State-of-the-art_challenges_and_open_issues_in_the_integration_of_Internet_of_Things_and_Cloud_Computing","281103856_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_for_Agriculture_The_State-of-the-Art_in_Practice_and_Future_Challenges","272813804_Smart_Agriculture_Based_on_Cloud_Computing_and_IOT","262171284_Architecture_of_Internet_of_Things_and_Its_Key_Technology_Integration_Based-On_RFID","261261001_Data_acquisition_and_control_using_Arduino-Android_platform_Smart_plug","260498403_Prototyping_Connected_Devices_for_the_Internet_of_Things","257018744_Farm_management_systems_and_the_Future_Internet_era","252020446_The_Application_of_Cloud_Computing_and_the_Internet_of_Things_in_Agriculture_and_Forestry","238638576_Internet_of_Things_Security_Analysis","238090748_RFID_What's_in_it_for_the_forecaster","238010164_Evolution_of_wireless_sensor_networks_towards_the_Internet_of_Things_A_survey","235363097_Exploring_Marketing_Research","228095891_Internet_of_Things_IoT_A_Vision_Architectural_Elements_and_FutureDirections","220585836_Internet_of_Things_Objectives_and_Scientific_Challenges","28066035_China's_New_Diplomacy"]}
