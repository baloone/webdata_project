{"id":"351287586_The_Role_of_Smart_Personal_Assistant_for_improving_personal_Healthcare","abstract":"Machine learning is a subfield of computer science that evolved from the study of pattern recognition and computational learning theory in artificial intelligence. The focus of this paper is to improve personal healthcare using smart personal assistant which make use of the combination of machine learning and cloud. Making a doctor appointment through phone call is a tedious process and it may take more time. People who did not made the prior appointment have to wait on the queue which sometimes leads to dissatisfactions to the patients. To overcome this gap, smart personal assistant application is proposed using which users can get appointment of various doctors according to the current availability and at anytime and anywhere. This will improve time saving from patients' side as well as they will be satisfied by timely service.","authors":["Arul Srinivasan","Neela Madheswari","Chirag Patel"],"meta":["November 2018SSRN Electronic Journal 4(11):769-772","DOI:10.22161/ijaems.4.11.5","Projects: ResearchData Science and Machine Learning"],"references":["324497089_The_What_and_How_of_Smart_Personal_Assistants_Principles_and_Application_Domains_for_IS_Research","284812166_An_integrative_review_of_the_impact_of_mobile_technologies_used_by_healthcare_professionals_to_support_education_and_practice","281006272_Human-Computer_Interaction_Overview_on_State_of_the_Art","264516372_Building_the_Next_Generation_of_Personal_Digital_Assistants","43352261_Personal_digital_assistant_usage_among_undergraduate_medical_students_Exploring_trends_barriers_and_the_advent_of_smartphones"]}
