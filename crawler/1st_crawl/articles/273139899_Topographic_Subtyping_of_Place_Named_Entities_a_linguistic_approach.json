{"id":"273139899_Topographic_Subtyping_of_Place_Named_Entities_a_linguistic_approach","abstract":"The aim of this work is to find sub-types for Place Named Entities, from the analysis of relations between Place Names and a nominal group within a specific phrasal context. The proposed method combines the use of specific intra-sentential lexico-syntactic relations and external resources like gazetteers, thesauri, or ontologies. It relies on expanded spatial named entities recognition transcribed into a symbolic representation expressed in terms of semantic features. This symbolic representation will then be associated with a geo-coded representation, depending on the available resources. Our method is completely implemented and has been tested on a corpus of travelogues.","authors":["Van Tien Nguyen","Mauro Gaio","Ludovic Moncla"],"meta":["May 2013","Conference: The 16th AGILE International Conference on Geographic Information ScienceAt: Leuven, Belgium"],"references":["278820157_Cascades_de_transducteurs_autour_de_la_reconnaissance_des_entites_nommees","228755322_Etude_des_caracteristiques_projectives_des_objets_spatiaux_et_de_leurs_relations","228526689_Detecting_semantic_relations_between_terms_in_definitions","312461679_Using_orientation_information_for_qualitative_spatial_reasoning_theories_and_methods_of_spatio-temporal_reasoning_in_geographic_space","273189013_L'expression_du_deplacement_dans_la_construction_transitive_directe","240823881_La_notion_semantique_de_deplacement_dans_une_classification_syntaxique_des_verbes_locatifs","237127093_Using_Lexico-Syntactic_Ontology_Design_Patterns_for_ontology_creation_and_population","223942887_Exploring_phrasal_context_and_error_correction_heuristics_in_bootstrapping_for_geographic_named_entity_annotation","221600710_Maintaining_Qualitative_Spatial_Knowledge","221438819_Toponym_Disambiguation_Using_Events","221393453_A_Spatial_Logic_based_on_Regions_and_Connection","221160348_Using_GeoWordNet_for_Geographical_Information_Retrieval","220760999_Extraction_des_connaissances_a_partir_du_Web_pour_la_recherche_des_images_georeferencees","221299628_Toponym_resolution_in_text_abstract_only_which_sheffield_is_it","221101345_Automatic_Acquisition_of_Hyponyms_from_Large_Text_Corpora"]}
