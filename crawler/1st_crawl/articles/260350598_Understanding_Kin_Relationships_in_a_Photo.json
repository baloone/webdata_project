{"id":"260350598_Understanding_Kin_Relationships_in_a_Photo","abstract":"There is an urgent need to organize and manage images of people automatically due to the recent explosion of such data on the Web in general and in social media in particular. Beyond face detection and face recognition, which have been extensively studied over the past decade, perhaps the most interesting aspect related to human-centered images is the relationship of people in the image. In this work, we focus on a novel solution to the latter problem, in particular the kin relationships. To this end, we constructed two databases: the first one named UB KinFace Ver2.0, which consists of images of children, their young parents and old parents, and the second one named FamilyFace. Next, we develop a transfer subspace learning based algorithm in order to reduce the significant differences in the appearance distributions between children and old parents facial images. Moreover, by exploring the semantic relevance of the associated metadata, we propose an algorithm to predict the most likely kin relationships embedded in an image. In addition, human subjects are used in a baseline study on both databases. Experimental results have shown that the proposed algorithms can effectively annotate the kin relationships among people in an image and semantic context can further improve the accuracy.","authors":["Siyu Xia","Ming Shao","Jiebo Luo","Yun Fu"],"meta":["August 2012IEEE Transactions on Multimedia 14(4):1046-1056","DOI:10.1109/TMM.2012.2187436"],"references":["317083802_Eigenfaces_vs_Fisherfaces_Recognition_Using_Class_Specific_Linear_Projection","228453173_Attribute_and_Simile_Classifiers_for_Face_Verification_In_submission_please_do_not_distribute","226575631_Eigenfaces_vs_Fisherfaces_Recognition_Using_Class_Specific_Linear_Projection","224164307_Face_recognition_with_learning-based_descriptor","224150036_Cross-database_age_estimation_based_on_transfer_learning","224135964_Attribute_and_Simile_Classifiers_for_Face_Verification","224135938_Is_that_you_Metric_Learning_Approaches_for_Face_Identification","221617871_Multi-Task_Feature_Learning","221606791_Mapping_and_Revising_Markov_Logic_Networks_for_Transfer_Learning","221362235_Understanding_Images_of_Groups_of_People","221361623_Using_Group_Prior_to_Identify_People_in_Consumer_Images","221305165_Discriminative_Locality_Alignment","221305137_Seeing_People_in_Social_Context_Recognizing_People_and_Social_Relationships","221124846_Towards_computational_models_of_kinship_verification","221111859_Robust_Real-Time_Face_Detection","220924014_Leveraging_context_to_resolve_identity_in_photo_albums","220660094_Robust_Real-Time_Face_Detection","220181328_Graph_Embedding_and_Extensions_A_General_Framework_for_Dimensionality_Reduction","200038912_Self-taught_learning_Transfer_learning_from_unlabeled_data","6858077_Total_variation_models_for_variable_lighting_face_recognition","6591094_Where_are_kin_recognition_signals_in_the_human_face","5606734_Face_Recognition_by_Independent_Component_Analysis","311219757_Understanding_images_of_groups_of_people","303160777_Locality_preserving_projections","285090956_Face_Recognition_The_Problem_of_Compensating_for_Changes_in_Illumination_Direction","281297652_Face_description_with_local_binary_patterns_Application_to_face_recognition","261061926_Handbook_of_Face_Recognition","257816623_Handbook_of_Face_Recognition","256075302_Eigenfaces_for_Recognition","252028584_Genealogical_face_recognition_based_on_UB_KinFace_database","244138376_Locality_Preserving_Projections_LPP","243772019_Recognition_using_class_specific_linear_projection","232639968_Names_and_Faces_in_the_News","228656456_Differential_facial_resemblance_of_young_children_to_their_parents_Who_do_children_look_like_more","224604612_A_Survey_on_Transfer_Learning","224141256_Toward_Large-Scale_Face_Recognition_Using_Social_Network_Context","221653922_Co-clustering_based_classification_for_out-of-domain_documents","221604898_Transferring_Naive_Bayes_Classifiers_for_Text_Classification","221346478_Boosting_for_Transfer_Learning","221318859_Learning_people_annotation_from_the_web_via_consistency_learning","220814963_Kinship_Verification_through_Transfer_Learning","220765675_A_Comparative_Study_of_Methods_for_Transductive_Transfer_Learning","220660473_Face_Hallucination_Theory_and_Practice","220372627_A_face_emotion_tree_structure_representation_with_probabilistic_recursive_neural_network_modeling","220073002_Bregman_Divergence-Based_Regularization_for_Transfer_Subspace_Learning","215470717_Instance_Weighting_for_Domain_Adaptation_in_NLP","29622837_Labeled_Faces_in_the_Wild_A_Database_forStudying_Face_Recognition_in_Unconstrained_Environments","23412450_Kin_recognition_signals_in_adult_faces","6690163_Graph_embedding_and_extensions_a_general_framework_for_dimensionality_reduction","6690158_Face_Description_with_Local_Binary_Patterns_Application_to_Face_Recognition","5368569_Generalized_Face_Super-Resolution","4351188_Discovery_of_social_relationships_in_consumer_photo_collections_using_Markov_Logic","4246130_Modeling_Age_Progression_in_Young_Faces","4351119_Clothing_cosegmentation_for_recognizing_people","4301656_Unsupervised_Joint_Alignment_of_Complex_Images"]}
