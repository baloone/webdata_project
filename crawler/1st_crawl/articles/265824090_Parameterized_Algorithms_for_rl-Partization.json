{"id":"265824090_Parameterized_Algorithms_for_rl-Partization","abstract":"We consider the (r,l)-partization problem of finding a set of at most k vertices whose deletion results in a graph that can be partitioned into r independent sets and l cliques. Restricted to perfect graphs and split graphs, we describe sequacious fixed-parameter tractability results for (r,0)-partization, parameterized by k and r. For (r,l)-partization where r+l=2, we describe an O * (2 k ) algorithm for perfect graphs. We then study the parameterized complexity hardness of a generalization of the above guarantee vertex cover by a reduction from (r,l)-partization.","authors":["Krithika Ramaswamy","N.S.
