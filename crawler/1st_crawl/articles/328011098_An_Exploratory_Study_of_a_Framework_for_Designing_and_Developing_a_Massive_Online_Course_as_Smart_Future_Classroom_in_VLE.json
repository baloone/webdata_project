{"id":"328011098_An_Exploratory_Study_of_a_Framework_for_Designing_and_Developing_a_Massive_Online_Course_as_Smart_Future_Classroom_in_VLE","abstract":"The development of any course designed for a massive audience should be an iterative and careful process. This is to ensure all courses developed in virtual learning environment (VLE) can replace face-to-face class effectively. This study is an exploratory study to conceptualize a learning design framework (LDF) for massive online learners in VLE. Research shows that minimal empirical studies related to framework for designing and developing of massive online course in VLE in a Malaysian context exist. Further, the design of online content seldom informed by learning theories and instructional strategies. This study informs the need to have a LDF and the study shall first be conducted through semi-structured, in-depth interview of the three instructional designers (ID) to identify their thought process in learning design. A study of the current literature on learning design shall also be conducted as a follow up to understand the current trends in Education 4.0 and to explore the emerging themes related to learning theories and instructional design strategies. Finally, the experts will review and validate this framework as well as to suggest ways to make improvement on the LDF.","authors":["Enna Ayub","Wei Wei Goh","Johan Eddy Luaran","Cl Lim"],"meta":["July 2018","DOI:10.1145/3241748.3241778","Conference: the 2nd International Conference"],"references":["322698721_The_Importance_of_Teacher's_Presence_and_Engagement_in_MOOC_Learning_Environment_A_Case_Study","322369069_Framework_for_E-learning_in_Higher_Institutions_of_Learning_in_Developing_Countries_A_Systematic_Review_of_Literature","321957675_A_framework_for_designing_and_developing_multimedia-based_performance_assessment_in_vocational_education","318928616_The_Effectiveness_of_MOOC_Among_Learners_Based_on_Kirkpatrick's_Model","317364047_Developing_a_Pedagogy_Framework_for_Institution-Wide_Implementation_of_MOOC_A_Case_Study_from_a_Malaysian_Private_University","326224032_4-stage_online_presence_model_Model_for_module_design_and_delivery_using_web_20_technologies_to_facilitate_critical_thinking_skills","319460269_Design_and_development_research","319030263_Persistence_Patterns_in_Massive_Open_Online_Courses_MOOCs","317842502_Research_Methods_in_Social_Sciences","317248178_Design_and_Development_of_Experiencing_Malaysian_Architecture_Module_Through_MOOCs"]}
