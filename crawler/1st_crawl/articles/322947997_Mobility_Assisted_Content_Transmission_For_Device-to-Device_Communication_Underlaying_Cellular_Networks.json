{"id":"322947997_Mobility_Assisted_Content_Transmission_For_Device-to-Device_Communication_Underlaying_Cellular_Networks","abstract":"With the explosion growth of mobile data demands for proximal services, device-to-device (D2D) communication is proposed as a vital technology for the next generation cellular network. With the extensive increase in personal mobile devices, content transmission of proximal devices underlaying cellular networks is gaining considerable attention. However, due to the mobility constraint of mobile devices, content transmission under- laying cellular networks greatly affects the overall transmission capacity of these proximal devices. In this paper, we investi- gate the problem of mobility assisted content transmission and resource allocation by exploiting the contact patterns regulated by these proximal devices' mobility. We formulate the content transmission and resource allocation with the help of the statistic property of contact rates, and then utilize convex optimization to determine the successful content transmission and resource allocation scheme. We present the optimal resource allocated content transmission (RACT) algorithm based on the pseudo- polynomial time algorithm using dynamic programming to solve the optimization problem. Real data traces are utilized in our proposed algorithm to find out the natural strategies of mobile homophily. Extensive simulations under the realistic human mobility factors are evaluated to demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed scheme.","authors":["Muhammad Waqas","Ming Zeng","Yong Li","Depeng Jin"],"meta":["February 2018IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TVT.2018.2802448"],"references":["307088181_Share_communication_and_computation_resources_on_mobile_devices_A_social_awareness_perspective","307087709_VeShare_A_D2D_infrastructure_for_real-time_social-enabled_vehicle_networks","304530746_Mobility-Aware_Caching_and_Computation_Offloading_in_5G_Ultra-Dense_Cellular_Networks","299538714_Characterization_of_User_Mobility_in_Cellular-Assisted_D2D_Systems","299416736_Wireless_Distributed_Storage_in_Socially_Enabled_D2D_Communications","260508626_An_Optimal_Relaying_Scheme_for_Delay-Tolerant_Networks_With_Heterogeneous_Mobile_Nodes","257299276_A_Survey_on_Device-to-Device_Communication_in_Cellular_Networks","257246889_An_Overview_on_3GPP_Device-to-Device_Proximity_Services","254063221_Design_aspects_of_network_assisted_Device-to-Device_communications","254061548_Operator_controlled_Device-to-Device_communications_in_LTE-Advanced_networks","224088484_Device-to-Device_communication_as_an_underlay_to_LTE-Advanced_networks","317426725_Mobility-Assisted_Device_to_Device_Communications_For_Content_Transmission","312603218_Full-Duplex_Device-to-Device_Communication_for_Wireless_VideoDistribution","312169319_Security_and_Privacy_in_Device-to-Device_D2D_Communication_A_Review","309916697_A_novel_approach_of_mobility_management_for_the_D2D_communications_in_5G_mobile_cellular_network_system","308904033_Mobility_impact_on_mode_selection_map_in_D2D_networks-An_analytical_approach","307526366_How_to_Download_More_Data_from_Neighbors_A_Metric_for_D2D_Data_Offloading_Opportunity","306376915_Modeling_Cellular_Networks_With_Full-Duplex_D2D_Communication_A_Stochastic_Geometry_Approach","305705562_Movement-based_incentive_for_cellular_traffic_offloading_through_D2D_communications","305675892_Mobility_increases_throughput_of_wireless_device-to-device_networks_with_coded_caching","305675849_Device-to-device_communication_in_cellular_networks_under_statistical_queueing_constraints","305675091_A_mobility-based_mode_selection_technique_for_fair_spatial_dissemination_of_data_in_multi-channel_device-to-device_communication","301648340_Effect_of_User_Mobility_on_the_Performance_of_Device-to-Device_Networks_with_Distributed_Caching","295243768_Next_Generation_5G_Wireless_Networks_A_Comprehensive_Survey","290474755_Efficient_Cellular_Load_Balancing_Through_Mobility-Enriched_Vehicular_Communications","283563034_Interference_Coordination_in_Heterogeneous_Small-Cell_Networks_A_Coalition_Formation_Game_Approach","280498201_Social_Data_Offloading_in_D2D-Enhanced_Cellular_Networks_by_Network_Formation_Games","276845323_Social-Aware_Resource_Allocation_for_Device-to-Device_Communications_Underlaying_Cellular_Networks","275243797_Mobility_Models_Traces_and_Impact_of_Mobility_on_Opportunistic_Routing_Algorithms_A_Survey","268490648_Approximation_algorithms_Translated_from_the_English_original_by_Nicolas_Schabanel","267627590_A_dynamic_coalition_formation_framework_for_interference_management_in_dense_small-cell_networks","263813540_Optimal_Mobile_Content_Downloading_in_Device-to-Device_Communication_Underlaying_Cellular_Networks","263813382_Coalitional_Games_for_Resource_Allocation_in_the_Device-to-Device_Uplink_Underlaying_Cellular_Networks","263285605_Social-Aware_D2D_Communications_Qualitative_Insights_and_Quantitative_Analysis","263003228_Analytical_Modeling_of_Mode_Selection_and_Power_Control_for_Underlay_D2D_Communication_in_Cellular_Networks","262231678_The_role_of_mobility_for_D2D_communications_in_LTE-advanced_networks_Energy_vs_bandwidth_efficiency","233387748_Efficiency_Resource_Allocation_for_Device-to-Device_UnderlayCommunication_Systems_A_Reverse_Iterative_Combinatorial_Auction_BasedApproach","230750737_Global_Mobile_Data_Traffic_Forecast_Update_2009-2014"]}
