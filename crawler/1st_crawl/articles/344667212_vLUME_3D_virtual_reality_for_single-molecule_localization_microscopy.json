{"id":"344667212_vLUME_3D_virtual_reality_for_single-molecule_localization_microscopy","abstract":"vLUME is a virtual reality software package designed to render large three-dimensional single-molecule localization microscopy datasets. vLUME features include visualization, segmentation, bespoke analysis of complex local geometries and exporting features. vLUME can perform complex analysis on real three-dimensional biological samples that would otherwise be impossible by using regular flat-screen visualization programs. vLUME is a complete virtual reality environment for visualizing, analyzing and interacting with three-dimensional single-molecule localization microscopy data.","authors":["Alexander Spark","Alexandre Kitching","Daniel Esteban-Ferrer","Anoushka Handa"],"meta":["November 2020Nature Methods 17(11):1-3","DOI:10.1038/s41592-020-0962-1"],"references":["338069774_Ultrastructure_of_the_axonal_periodic_scaffold_reveals_a_braid-like_organization_of_actin_rings","332281655_Super-resolution_fight_club_Assessment_of_2D_3D_single-molecule_localization_microscopy_software","325958868_ConfocalVR_Immersive_Visualization_Applied_to_Confocal_Microscopy","324365295_Real-time_3D_single-molecule_localization_using_experimental_point_spread_functions","323273060_Quantitative_mapping_and_minimization_of_super-resolution_optical_imaging_artifacts","317957006_3D_Bayesian_cluster_analysis_of_super-resolution_data_reveals_LAT_recruitment_to_the_T_cell_synapse","351048346_Development_of_Three-Dimensional_Super-Resolution_Imaging_Using_a_Double-Helix_Point_Spread_Function","337200709_Evaluation_of_Navigation_Operations_in_Immersive_Microscopic_Visualization","332987651_About_samples_giving_examples_optimized_procedures_for_Single_Molecule_Localization_Microscopy","320837018_The_nano-architecture_of_the_axonal_cytoskeleton","316052851_Three-Dimensional_Super-Resolution_in_Eukaryotic_Cells_Using_the_Double-Helix_Point_Spread_Function","313784279_Virtual_reality_assisted_microscopy_data_visualization_and_colocalization_analysis","313267835_Three-Dimensional_Localization_of_Single_Molecules_for_Super-Resolution_Imaging_and_Single-Particle_Tracking","301621489_PSD95_nanoclusters_are_postsynaptic_building_blocks_in_hippocampus_circuits_OPEN","297593200_High-density_three-dimensional_localization_microscopy_across_large_volumes"]}
