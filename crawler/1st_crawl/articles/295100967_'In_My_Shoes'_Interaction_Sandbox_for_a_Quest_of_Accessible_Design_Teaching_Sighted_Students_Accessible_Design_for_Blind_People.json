{"id":"295100967_'In_My_Shoes'_Interaction_Sandbox_for_a_Quest_of_Accessible_Design_Teaching_Sighted_Students_Accessible_Design_for_Blind_People","abstract":"This paper examines current practices in motivating students to design accessible technologies, and proposes an additional method to promote a long-term, steadfast commitment to accessibility. We examine recent reports of teaching accessibility for blind users to sighted students, and we find three types of motivational devices: 1) a ‘web of arguments’ as to morality, legality, and usefulness, 2) empathy, and 3) framing accessibility through mainstreaming. We observe that the challenge of interactional malaise between sighted and blind people is often neglected, and we propose an ‘Interaction Sandbox’ to overcome it. We also put forward an additional way of framing accessible design, in order to position it as a work of autonomy, mastery, and purpose: the ‘Quest’ metaphor. Accessible design is thus introduced as the pursuit of a daring goal against widespread adversity, through mastery, in the company of powerful characters. The Quest is set in motion by bringing students to appreciate the technical wizardry of accessible design, its aesthetics, and the heroism of blind people as skilled navigators of a dangerous world.","authors":["Cosima Rughinis","Răzvan Rughiniş"],"meta":["June 2014","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-07437-5_7","Conference: International Conference on Universal Access in Human-Computer Interaction"],"references":["260587080_How_do_professionals_who_create_computing_technologies_consider_accessibility","256502412_The_Effects_of_Imagined_Versus_Actual_Contact_With_a_Person_With_a_Diagnosis_of_Schizophrenia","254095730_Enhaing_imagined_contact_to_reduce_prejudice_against_people_with_schizophrenia","238106570_The_Role_of_Aesthetics_in_Web_Design","221652180_Including_accessibility_within_and_beyond_undergraduate_computing_courses","24434840_Can_Imagined_Interactions_Produce_Positive_Perceptions_Reducing_Prejudice_Through_Simulated_Social_Contact","290298363_Scaffolding_a_technical_community_of_students_through_social_gaming_Lessons_from_a_serious_game_evaluation","289944042_Looking_blind_A_revelation_of_culture's_eye","271417799_Accessibility_first","266652937_A_holistic_and_pragmatic_approach_to_teaching_web_accessibility_in_an_undergraduate_web_design_course","262008725_Just_Ask_Integrating_Accessibility_Throughout_Design","261464578_Gamification_for_productive_interaction_Reading_and_working_with_the_gamification_debate_in_education","261092361_The_Negotiation_of_Knowledge_and_Knowing_The_Challenge_of_Using_Wiki_Technology_in_Computer_Supported_Collaborative_Learning","254725898_Social_order_and_the_construction_of_meaning_in_social_interaction_Troubled_communication_between_sighted_and_partially_sightedblind_people","249986059_Societal_Reaction_And_The_Physically_Disabled_Bringing_The_Impariment_Back_In","235339931_The_interplay_between_web_aesthetics_and_accessibility","234831324_Using_screen_readers_to_reinforce_web_accessibility_education","221652011_A_General_Education_course_on_Universal_Access_Disability_Technology_and_Society","221537963_Opening_the_eyes_of_those_who_can_see_to_the_world_of_those_who_can't","221537959_Accessibility_first_a_new_approach_to_web_design","221536772_Accessibility_in_introductory_computer_science","220933670_Accessibility_and_design_a_failure_of_the_imagination","3981337_Access_for_everyone_introducing_accessibility_issues_to_students_in_Internet_programming_courses"]}
