{"id":"231548799_Graph-based_Discovery_of_Ontology_Change_Patterns","abstract":"Ontologies can support a variety of purposes, ranging from capturing conceptual knowledge to the organisation of digital content and information. However, information systems are always subject to change and ontology change management can pose challenges. We inves-tigate ontology change representation and discovery of change patterns. Ontology changes are formalised as graph-based change logs. We use attributed graphs, which are typed over a generic graph with node and edge attribution. We analyse ontology change logs, represented as graphs, and identify frequent change sequences. Such sequences are applied as a reference in order to discover reusable, often domain-specific and usage-driven change patterns. We describe the pattern discovery algorithms and measure their performance using experimental results.","authors":["Muhammad Javed","Yalemisew Abgaz","Claus Pahl"],"meta":["October 2011","Conference: ISWC Workshops: EvoyDyn"],"references":["249975776_Fundamental_Theory_for_Typed_Attributed_Graph_Transformation_Long_Version","248289911_Ontology_Evolution_Not_the_Same_as_Schema_Evolution","228967367_C_A_layered_framework_for_pattern-based_ontology_evolution","221466656_Change_Representation_For_OWL_2_Ontologies","221466578_On_Detecting_High-Level_Changes_in_RDFS_KBs","220916892_An_analysis_of_collaborative_patterns_in_large-scale_ontology_development_projects","220829811_A_Pattern-Based_Framework_of_Change_Operators_for_Ontology_Evolution","323676421_A_pattern-based_framework_of_change_operators_for_ontology_evolution","262238973_Algorithms_for_Context_Based_Sequential_Pattern_Mining","220906818_Efficiently_Mining_Closed_Subsequences_with_Gap_Constraints"]}
