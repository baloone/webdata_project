In the process a novel approach for synthetic training data generation from single camera is developed, thus reducing the real world physical requirements for the algorithm and demonstrating the improved self-driving algorithm development pipeline from fully virtual environments to scaled physical models, to full self-driving cars, potentially leveraging the global developer community for development.
