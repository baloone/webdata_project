{"id":"268815772_P_A_NEW_PATH_PLANNING_ALGORITHM_FOR_AUTONOMOUS_ROBOT_IN_AN_UNKNOWN_ENVIRONMENT","abstract":"In this paper we present P* “P-Star” witch is a new algorithm for sensor based path planning. This work is based on PointBug algorithm [11] where we applied some improvements and modifications to overcome some important problems (like infinite loops and the bypass of some sub-paths). Moreover, we present some simulation results and comparisons with PointBug to evaluate and to verify the performance and the power of the proposed algorithm.","authors":["Farouk Meddah","Lynda Dib"],"meta":["October 2014","DOI:10.15224/978-1-63248-029-3-72","Conference: Second International Conference on Advances in Computing, Electronics and Communication - ACEC 2014At: Switzerland"],"references":[]}
