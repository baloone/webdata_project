{"id":"313614274_Using_Continuous_Power_Modulation_for_Exchanging_Local_Channel_State_Information","abstract":"This letter provides a simple but efficient technique, which allows each transmitter of an interference network, to exchange local channel state information with the other transmitters. One salient feature of the proposed technique is that a transmitter only needs measurements of the signal power at its intended receiver to implement it, making direct inter-transmitter signaling channels unnecessary. The key idea to achieve this is to use a transient period during which the continuous power level of a transmitter is taken to be the linear combination of the channel gains to be exchanged.","authors":["Chao Zhang","Samson Lasaulce","Vineeth S Varma"],"meta":["January 2017IEEE Wireless Communication Letters 21(5)","Project: Interference management"],"references":["308831740_Queueing_stability_and_CSI_probing_of_a_TDD_wireless_network_with_interference_alignment","304525182_Power_modulation_Application_to_inter-cell_interference_coordination","224374534_The_MIMO_Iterative_Waterfilling_Algorithm","3434690_Binary_Power_Control_for_Sum_Rate_Maximization_over_Multiple_Interfering_Links","304525340_Power_modulation_Application_to_inter-cell_interference_coordination","292252868_LTE_the_UMTS_long_term_evolution_from_theory_to_practice","235509521_CSI_Sharing_Strategies_for_Transmitter_Cooperation_in_Wireless_Networks","224439791_Interference_Coordination_and_Cancellation_for_4G_Networks","220250225_Channel_estimation_for_wireless_OFDM_systems","51931528_Degrees_of_freedom_of_the_network_MIMO_channel_with_distributed_CSI","3234825_Distributed_Multiuser_Power_Control_for_Digital_Subscriber_Lines"]}
