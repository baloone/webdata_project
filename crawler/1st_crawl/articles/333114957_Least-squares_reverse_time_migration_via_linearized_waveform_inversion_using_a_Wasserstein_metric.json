{"id":"333114957_Least-squares_reverse_time_migration_via_linearized_waveform_inversion_using_a_Wasserstein_metric","abstract":"Least-squares reverse time migration (LSRTM), an effective tool for imaging the structures of the earth from seismograms, can be characterized as a linearized waveform inversion problem. We have investigated the performance of three minimization functionals as the 𝐿2 norm, the hybrid 𝐿1/𝐿2 norm, and the Wasserstein metric (𝑊1 metric) for LSRTM. The 𝑊1 metric used in this study is based on the dynamic formulation of transport problems, and a primal-dual hybrid gradient algorithm is introduced to efficiently compute the 𝑊1 metric between two seismograms. One-dimensional signal analysis has demonstrated that the 𝑊1 metric behaves like the 𝐿1 norm for two amplitude-varied signals. Unlike the 𝐿1 norm, the 𝑊1 metric does not suffer from the differentiability issue for null residuals. Numerical examples of the application of three misfit functions to LSRTM on synthetic data have demonstrated that, compared to the 𝐿2 norm, the hybrid 𝐿1/𝐿2 norm and 𝑊1 metric can accelerate LSRTM and are less sensitive to non-Gaussian noise. For the field data application, the 𝑊1 metric produces the most reliable imaging results. The hybrid 𝐿1/𝐿2 norm requires tedious trial-and-error tests for the judicious threshold parameter selection. Hence, the more automatic 𝑊1 metric is recommended as a robust alternative to the customary 𝐿2 norm for time-domain LSRTM.","authors":["Peng Yong","Jian‐Ping Huang","Zhenchun Li","Wenyuan Liao"],"meta":["May 2019Geophysics 84(5):1-88","DOI:10.1190/geo2018-0619.1"],"references":["323073437_A_wavefield-separation-based_elastic_least-squares_reverse_time_migration","345717676_Seismic_Inversion","335461147_Misfit_function_for_full_waveform_inversion_based_on_the_Wasserstein_metric_with_dynamic_formulation","331972546_3D_Edge_Diffraction_Coefficients_in_the_Azimuth_and_Emergence_Domain","327235319_Interparameter_trade-off_quantification_and_reduction_in_isotropic-elastic_full-waveform_inversion_Synthetic_experiments_and_Hussar_land_data_set_application","324914760_A_structural_rank_reduction_operator_for_removing_artifacts_in_least-squares_reverse_time_migration","323675659_Earth_Mover's_Distance_Based_On_Gradient_Flow_For_Full_Waveform_Inversion","323121002_Least-squares_reverse_time_migration_with_an_angle-dependent_weighting_factor","322931099_An_analytic_approach_to_minimum_phase_signals","321047675_Least-squares_Fourier_Finite_Difference_Pre-stack_Depth_Migration_for_VTI_media"]}
