{"id":"322738011_Cloud_computing_-_Issues_research_and_implementations","abstract":"\"Cloud\" computing - a relatively recent term, builds on decades of research in virtualization, distributed computing, utility computing, and more recently networking, web and software services. It implies a service oriented architecture, reduced information technology overhead for the end-user, great flexibility, reduced total cost of ownership, on-demand services and many other things. This paper discusses the concept of \"cloud\" computing, some of the issues it tries to address, related research topics, and a \"cloud\" implementation available today.","authors":["M.A. Vouk"],"meta":["January 2008Journal of Computing and Information Technology 16(4):235-246","DOI:10.2498/cit.1001391"],"references":[]}
