{"id":"264160660_Uniform_and_Bernoulli_measures_on_the_boundary_of_trace_monoids","abstract":"Trace monoids and heaps of pieces appear in various contexts in\ncombinatorics. They are also natural models to describe the executions in\nasynchronous systems. The presence of commuting pieces and the absence of a\nglobal clock make it challenging to add a probabilistic layer to the model. We\nintroduce and study the class of Bernoulli probability measures, among which\nthe uniform ones, that we claim to be the simplest adequate measures on\ninfinite traces. To explicit them, we strongly rely on trace combinatorics with\nthe M\\\"obius polynomial in the key role.","authors":["Samy Abbes","Jean Mairesse"],"meta":["July 2014Journal of Combinatorial Theory Series A 135","DOI:10.1016/j.jcta.2015.05.003","SourcearXiv"],"references":["268041221_Random_Walks_on_Groups_and_Monoids_with_a_Markovian_Harmonic_Measure","3023845_Approximating_the_spectral_radius_of_sets_of_matrices_in_the_max-algebra_is_NP-hard","285911663_Invariant_measures_of_the_geodesic_flow_and_measures_at_infinity_on_negatively_curved_manifolds","283559504_Counting_Techniques_for_Inclusion_Equivalence_and_Membership_Problems","270443185_Markov_Chains_Gibbs_Fields_Monte_Carlo_Simulation_and_Queues","267148160_Non-negative_matrices_and_Markov_chains_Revised_reprint_of_the_2nd_ed","263987984_APPROXIMATING_THE_MEAN_SPEEDUP_IN_TRACE_MONOIDS","259133951_Regular_languages_and_partial_commutations","256554957_Event_structures_and_trace_monoids","248782140_Heaps_of_pieces_I_Basic_denitions_and_combinatorial_lemmas","243770212_Problemes_Combinatoires_de_Commutation_et_Rearrangements","236887234_Markov_two-components_processes","230641324_An_Introduction_to_Symbolic_Dynamics_and_Coding","229003485_Stochastic_Petri_Nets_Modelling_Stability_Simulation","228057773_Random_Generation_of_Combinatorial_Structures_from_a_Uniform_Distribution","227088955_On_the_foundations_of_combinatorial_theory_I_Theory_of_Mbius_Functions","225371161_Heaps_of_Pieces_I_Basic_Definitions_and_Combinatorial_Lemmas","225136360_Statistical_Properties_of_Locally_Free_Groupswith_Applications_to_Braid_Groupsand_Growth_of_Random_Heaps","223462690_Concurrency_measure_in_commutation_monoids","222673441_Clique_polynomials_have_a_unique_root_of_smallest_modulus","222660878_Computing_the_average_parallelism_in_trace_monoids","221621807_Trace_Theory","220975561_Speedup_of_Recognizable_Trace_Languages","220248377_Probabilistic_Automata","45858668_Average_site_perimeter_of_directed_animals_on_the_two-dimensionallattices","38340803_Mesures_de_Patterson-Sullivan_sur_le_bord_d'un_espace_hyperbolique_au_sens_de_Gromov","31696277_Markov_Chains_Gibbs_Fields_Monte_Carlo_Simulation_and_Queues_P_Bremaud","29614808_True-concurrency_Probabilistic_Models_Markov_Nets_and_a_Law_of_Large_Numbers","29614546_On_Countable_Completions_of_Quotient_Ordered_Semigroups","2303092_A_Compositional_Approach_to_Performance_Modelling"]}
