{"id":"260993211_Estimating_long-term_multivariate_progression_from_short-term_data","abstract":"Motivation\nDiseases that progress slowly are often studied by observing cohorts at different stages of disease for short periods of time. The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) follows elders with various degrees of cognitive impairment, from normal to impaired. The study includes a rich panel of novel cognitive tests, biomarkers, and brain images collected every 6 months for as long as 6 years. The relative timing of the observations with respect to disease pathology is unknown. We propose a general semiparametric model and iterative estimation procedure to estimate simultaneously the pathological timing and long-term growth curves. The resulting estimates of long-term progression are fine-tuned using cognitive trajectories derived from the long-term “Personnes Agées Quid” study.\n\nResults\nWe demonstrate with simulations that the method can recover long-term disease trends from short-term observations. The method also estimates temporal ordering of individuals with respect to disease pathology, providing subject-specific prognostic estimates of the time until onset of symptoms. When the method is applied to ADNI data, the estimated growth curves are in general agreement with prevailing theories of the Alzheimer's disease cascade. Other data sets with common outcome measures can be combined using the proposed algorithm.\n\nAvailability\nSoftware to fit the model and reproduce results with the statistical software R is available as the grace package. ADNI data can be downloaded from the Laboratory of NeuroImaging.","authors":["Michael C Donohue","Hélène Jacqmin-Gadda","Mélanie Le Goff","Ronald Glenn Thomas"],"meta":["October 2014Alzheimer's & dementia: the journal of the Alzheimer's Association 10(5)","DOI:10.1016/j.jalz.2013.10.003"],"references":["291035233_Hypothetical_model_of_dynamic_biomarkers_of_the_Alzheimer's_pathological_cascade","229073407_Clinical_and_Biomarker_Changes_in_Dominantly_Inherited_Alzheimer's_Disease","42640409_Management_of_Migraine_Headache_in_the_Emergency_Department","38360258_Convergence_and_Consistency_Results_for_Self-Modeling_Nonlinear_Regression","21552973_The_PAQUID_epidemiological_program_on_brain_ageing","5587785_C_PiB_and_Structural_MRI_Provide_Complementary_Information_in_Imaging_of_AD_and_Amnestic_MCI","4743551_Bayesian_Hierarchical_Curve_Registration","288950558_11C_PiB_and_structural_MRI_provide_complementary_information_in_imaging_of_Alzheimer's_disease_and_amnestic_mild_cognitive_impairment","281345608_Ggplot2_Elegant_Graphics_for_Data_Analysis","254331865_Self_Modeling_Nonlinear_Regression","234697769_Tracking_pathophysiological_processes_in_Alzheimer's_disease_an_updated_hypothetical_model_of_dynamic_biomarkers","234697759_Biomarkers_for_Alzheimer's_The_sequel_of_an_original_model","228853953_Self-modeling_regression_for_multivariate_curve_data","227723038_Estimating_smooth_monotone_functions","227710721_Self_modeling_with_random_shift_and_scale_parameters_and_a_free-knot_spline_shape_function","227499581_Self-modelling_regression_for_longitudinal_data_with_time-invariant_covariates","221995960_Generalized_Additive_Models","208033930_Mixed-Effect_Models_in_S_and_S-plus","41055672_Hypothetical_model_of_dynamic_biomarkers_of_the_Alzheimer's_pathological_cascade","40819685_Alzheimer's_Disease_Neuroimaging_Initiative_ADNI_Clinical_characterization","26888526_Relationships_between_biomarkers_in_aging_and_dementia","24210461_Cerebrospinal_Fluid_Biomarker_Signature_in_Alzheimer's_Disease_Neuroimaging_Initiative_Subjects","23642708_Prodromal_Alzheimer's_Disease_Successive_Emergence_of_the_Clinical_Symptoms","20914481_Nonlinear_Mixed_Effects_Models_for_Repeated_Measures_Data","12532557_Self-Modeling_for_Two-Dimensional_Response_Curves","8690568_Shape-Invariant_Modeling_of_Circadian_Rhythms_with_Random_Effects_and_Smoothing_Spline_ANOVA_Decompositions","8525605_Self_Modeling_with_Flexible_Random_Time_Transformations","6735389_Infant_growth_modelling_using_a_shape_invariant_model_with_random_effects"]}
