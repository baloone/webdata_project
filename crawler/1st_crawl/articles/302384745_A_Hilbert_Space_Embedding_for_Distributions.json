{"id":"302384745_A_Hilbert_Space_Embedding_for_Distributions","abstract":"While kernel methods are the basis of many popular techniques in supervised learning, they are less commonly used in testing, estimation, and analysis of probability distributions, where information theoretic approaches rule the roost. However it becomes difficult to estimate mutual information or entropy if the data are high dimensional.","authors":["Alex Smola","Arthur Gretton","Le Song","Bernhard Sch√∂lkopf"],"meta":["October 2007","DOI:10.1007/978-3-540-75488-6_5","Conference: International Conference on Discovery Science"],"references":[]}
