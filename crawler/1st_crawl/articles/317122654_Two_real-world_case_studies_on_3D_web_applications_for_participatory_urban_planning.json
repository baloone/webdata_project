{"id":"317122654_Two_real-world_case_studies_on_3D_web_applications_for_participatory_urban_planning","abstract":"3D Web is a potential platform for publishing and distributing 3D visualizations that have proven useful in enabling the participation of the general public in urban planning. However, technical requirements imposed by detailed and rich real-world plans and related functionalities are demanding for 3D web technologies. In this paper we explore the maturity of modern 3D web technologies in participatory urban planning through two real-world case studies. Applications built on Unity-based platform are published on the web to allow the general public to create, browse and comment on urban plans. The virtual models of seven urban development sites of different visual styles are optimized in terms of download sizes and memory use to be feasible on browsers used by the general public. We report qualitative feedback from users and present a technical analysis of the applications in terms of download sizes, runtime performance and memory use. We summarize the findings of the case studies into an assessment of the general feasibility of modern 3D web technologies in web-based urban planning.","authors":["Toni Alatalo","Matti Pouke","Timo Koskela","Tomi Hurskainen"],"meta":["June 2017","DOI:10.1145/3055624.3075950","Conference: the 22nd International Conference","Project: Playsign & 6Aika collab with University and city of Oulu"],"references":["309615518_Web-based_Exploration_of_and_Interaction_with_Large_and_Deeply_Structured_Semantic_3D_City_Models_using_HTML5_and_WebGL","300490594_A_case_study_on_3D_geospatial_applications_in_the_web_using_state-of-the-art_WebGL_frameworks","277901005_Intelligent_Open_Data_3D_Maps_in_a_Collaborative_Virtual_World","237443110_CityGML_-_Interoperable_access_to_3D_city_models","226504520_Representing_and_Exchanging_3D_City_Models_with_CityGML","224817672_The_immersive_time-machine_a_virtual_exploration_of_the_history_of_Livorno","305421106_VirtualOulu_collaborative_immersive_and_extensible_3D_city_model_on_the_web","301647442_Measuring_QoS_in_Web-Based_Virtual_Worlds_-_an_Evaluation_of_Unity_3D_Web_Builds","274321705_Using_3D_visualization_methods_in_landscape_planning_An_evaluation_of_options_and_practical_issues","224242990_An_Entity-Component_Model_for_Extensible_Virtual_Worlds"]}
