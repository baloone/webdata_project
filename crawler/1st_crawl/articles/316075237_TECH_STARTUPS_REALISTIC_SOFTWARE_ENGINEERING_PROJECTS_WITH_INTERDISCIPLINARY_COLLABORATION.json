{"id":"316075237_TECH_STARTUPS_REALISTIC_SOFTWARE_ENGINEERING_PROJECTS_WITH_INTERDISCIPLINARY_COLLABORATION","abstract":"Team projects in software engineering courses can contextualize practical software development experience and help students transition into related careers. However, the traditional academic environment is not particularly conducive to realistic software development. Consequently, we developed a model for collaboration between students in Computer Science and Entrepreneurship programs to cultivate development of real software products. This paper describes our partnership and illustrates how courses teaching agile software development and lean startup methodologies complement each other to foster realistic, interdisciplinary \" Tech Startup \" team projects.","authors":["Kevin Buffardi","Colleen Robb","David R Rahn"],"meta":["January 2017","Project: Software Engineering Education Research"],"references":["308859673_Localized_open_source_collaboration_in_software_engineering_education","262174680_A_formative_study_of_influences_on_student_testing_behaviors","251784359_AGILE_DEVELOPMENT_LESSONS_LEARNED_FROM_THE_FIRST_SCRUM","228263808_What_Lies_Beneath_The_Experiential_Essence_of_Entrepreneurial_Thinking","286843377_Building_an_intellectual_property_and_equity_ownership_policy_for_entrepreneurship_programs_Three_different_approaches","260620671_Entrepreneurship_education_known_worlds_and_new_frontiers","257679579_Business_model_innovation_in_entrepreneurship","254008135_Open_source_project_as_a_pedagogical_tool_in_higher_education","220425562_Toy_projects_considered_harmful","3864362_Software_development_engineer_in_Microsoft_A_subjective_view_of_soft_skills_required"]}
