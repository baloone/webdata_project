{"id":"335780829_Overview_of_the_MEDIQA_2019_Shared_Task_on_Textual_Inference_Question_Entailment_and_Question_Answering","abstract":"This paper presents the MEDIQA 2019 shared task organized at the ACL-BioNLP workshop. The shared task is motivated by a need to develop relevant methods, techniques and gold standards for inference and entailment in the medical domain, and their application to improve domain specific information retrieval and question answering systems. MEDIQA 2019 includes three tasks: Natural Language Inference (NLI), Recognizing Question Entailment (RQE), and Question Answering (QA) in the medical domain. 72 teams participated in the challenge, achieving an accuracy of 98% in the NLI task, 74.9% in the RQE task, and 78.3% in the QA task. In this paper, we describe the tasks, the datasets, and the participantsâ€™ approaches and results. We hope that this shared task will attract further research efforts in textual inference, question entailment, and question answering in the medical domain.","authors":["Asma Ben Abacha","Chaitanya Shivade","Dina Demner-Fushman"],"meta":["January 2019","DOI:10.18653/v1/W19-5039","Conference: Proceedings of the 18th BioNLP Workshop and Shared Task"],"references":["336740921_A_question-entailment_approach_to_question_answering","336372914_Consumer_health_information_and_question_answering_helping_consumers_find_answers_to_their_health-related_information_needs","335784016_Saama_Research_at_MEDIQA_2019_Pre-trained_BioBERT_with_Attention_Visualisation_for_Medical_Natural_Language_Inference","335781343_ANU-CSIRO_at_MEDIQA_2019_Question_Answering_Using_Deep_Contextual_Knowledge","335781138_NCUEE_at_MEDIQA_2019_Medical_Text_Inference_Using_Ensemble_BERT-BiLSTM-Attention_Model","335786072_UW-BHI_at_MEDIQA_2019_An_Analysis_of_Representation_Methods_for_Medical_Natural_Language_Inference","335781341_DUT-BIM_at_MEDIQA_2019_Utilizing_Transformer_Network_and_Medical_Domain-Specific_Contextualized_Representations_for_Question_Answering","335781315_DoubleTransfer_at_MEDIQA_2019_Multi-Source_Transfer_Learning_for_Natural_Language_Understanding_in_the_Medical_Domain","335780927_Pentagon_at_MEDIQA_2019_Multi-task_Learning_for_Filtering_and_Re-ranking_Answers_using_Language_Inference_and_Question_Entailment","335780926_WTMED_at_MEDIQA_2019_A_Hybrid_Approach_to_Biomedical_Natural_Language_Inference"]}
