{"id":"314024589_Identification_of_electrocardiogram_signals_using_internet_of_things_based_on_combinatory_classification","abstract":"Combination of computer sciences and electronics has resulted in one of the most remarkable technologies of the recent years called internet of things, considered as a challenge in electronic health systems for taking care of patients. Internet of things presents a promising paradigm for management of digital identification in the form of service customization. The effect of internet of things on healthcare is still in its preliminary stages and requires a substantial development. Various equipment and services are developed and utilized for health systems by providing different things to establish communication and information provision to users at any conditions or places. In this paper, attempts have been made to detect electrocardiogram (ECG) signal through a wireless simple sensing network of body using internet of things operating based on classification and feature extraction.","authors":["Marzieh Faridi Masouleh","Mohammad Ali Afshar Kazemi","Mahmood Alborzi","Abbas Toloie Eshlaghy"],"meta":["February 2017International Journal of Modeling Simulation and Scientific Computing 8(3)","DOI:10.1142/S1793962317500350","Project: Optimazation Algorithms and Business Intelligence Models"],"references":["283716766_Improved_Bat_algorithm_for_the_detection_of_myocardial_infarction","268690312_WBAN_data_scheduling_and_aggregation_under_WBANWLAN_healthcare_network","258857016_Particle_Swarm_Optimization_for_Feature_Selection_in_Classification_A_Multi-Objective_Approach","237617706_Body_Sensor_Network_-_A_Wireless_Sensor_Platform_for_Pervasive_Healthcare_Monitoring","232742349_A_Synchronous_Multi-Body_Sensor_Platform_in_a_Wireless_Body_Sensor_Network_Design_and_Implementation","226658534_A_Tutorial_on_Support_Vector_Machines_for_Pattern_Recognition","222571757_The_Internet_of_Things_A_Survey","222299746_Wireless_sensor_networks_for_personal_health_monitoring_Issues_and_an_implementation","221966275_Bat_Algorithm_for_Multi-objective_Optimisation","220132723_BGSA_Binary_gravitational_search_algorithm","38363197_Simulated_Annealing","263268882_Feature_extraction_from_ECG_signals_using_wavelet_transforms_for_disease_diagnostics","257543806_Middleware_Solutions_for_the_Internet_of_Things","235890166_Music-Inspired_Harmony_Search_Algorithm_Theory_and_Applications","222853813_GSA_a_Gravitational_Search_Algorithm","222821637_A_hybrid_genetic_algorithm_for_feature_selection_wrapper_based_on_mutual_information","220593314_A_novel_algorithm_for_feature_selection_using_Harmony_Search_and_its_application_for_non-technical_losses_detection"]}
