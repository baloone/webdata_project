{"id":"316028987_An_assessment_of_resource_availability_for_problem_based_learning_in_a_Ghanaian_University_setting","abstract":"Purpose\nThe purpose of this paper is to assess the differences pertaining to the resources presently accessible for problem-based learning (PBL) among six colleges of Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST) in Ghana.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nData for the study are the cross-sectional type drawn from 1,020 students. Poisson and zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) models were implemented on the data to ascertain the variations regarding the extent of resources available for PBL across the colleges of the university.\n\nFindings\nThe study outlines the specific resources accessible for PBL across college levels of KNUST. On aggregate, 25.7 per cent reported that their respective colleges have sufficient resources, while 74.3 per cent indicated otherwise. The ZIP model exhibited superiority over the Poisson model, when compared under a Vuong test. As per the ZIP model, none of the colleges appeared to differ significantly in terms of having sufficient resource for PBL.\n\nPractical implications\nFindings are applicable to informed decision-making which targets achieving quality education through the use of PBL. Access to sufficient resources that meet the needs of colleges or departments of a University is emphasized.\n\nOriginality/value\nThe application of Poisson and ZIP models to aggregated count data in a PBL setting is novel.","authors":["Gabriel Asare Okyere","Richard Tawiah","Richard Bruce Lamptey","William Oduro"],"meta":["April 2017Quality Assurance in Education 25(2):237-247","DOI:10.1108/QAE-12-2015-0046","Project: Research papers on Library and Learning"],"references":["257803753_Poisson_regression_and_Zero-inflated_Poisson_regression_application_to_private_health_insurance_data","242222876_An_experiment_with_PBL_in_higher_education_as_appraised_by_the_teacher_and_students","51669728_Introducing_a_problem-based_learning_program_12_tips_for_success","27239027_When_is_PBL_More_Effective_A_Meta-synthesis_of_Meta-analyses_Comparing_PBL_to_Conventional_Classrooms","27234907_Goals_and_Strategies_of_a_Problem-based_Learning_Facilitator","26539706_Regression_Models_for_Count_Data_in_R","4895690_Likelihood_Ratio_Tests_for_Model_Selection_and_Non-Nested_Hypotheses","337990954_Designing_problems_for_Problem-Based_Learning_PBL_sessions_students_and_faculty_perceptions","275908151_Human_Resources_and_Logistic_Requirements_in_Problem_Based_Learning_Compared_to_Traditional_Learning","239601262_The_Challenge_of_Problem-Based_Learning","229781691_Enhancing_Undergraduate_Students'_Chemistry_Understanding_through_Project-Based_Learning_in_an_IT_Environment","229503861_Problem-based_learning_in_medicine_and_beyond_A_brief_overview","226053277_Problem-Based_Learning_What_and_How_Do_Students_Learn","51188969_Teacher_as_learners_in_a_cooperative_learning_biochemistry_class","51188908_The_biological_activity_of_the_large-T_protein_of_SV40_virus","27240121_Overview_of_Problem-Based_Learning_Definitions_and_Distinctions","21636131_The_psychological_basis_of_problem-based_learning_A_review_of_the_evidence","16376234_Problem-Based_Learning_Rationale_and_Description","13225718_Do_we_all_mean_the_same_thing_by_''Problem-based_Learning''_A_review_of_the_concepts_and_a_formulation_of_the_ground_rules"]}
