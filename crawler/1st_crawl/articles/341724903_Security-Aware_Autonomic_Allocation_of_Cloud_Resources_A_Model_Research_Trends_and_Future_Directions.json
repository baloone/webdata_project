{"id":"341724903_Security-Aware_Autonomic_Allocation_of_Cloud_Resources_A_Model_Research_Trends_and_Future_Directions","abstract":"Cloud computing has emerged as a dominant platform for computing for the foreseeable future. A key factor in the adoption of this technology is its security and reliability. Here, this article addresses a key challenge which is the secure allocation of resources. The authors propose a security-based resource allocation model for execution of cloud workloads called STARK. The solution is designed to ensure security against probing, User to Root (U2R), Remote to Local (R2L) and Denial of Service (DoS) attacks whilst the execution of heterogeneous cloud workloads. Further, this paper highlights the promising directions for future research.","authors":["Sukhpal Singh Gill","Arash Shaghaghi"],"meta":["May 2020Journal of Organizational and End User Computing 32(3):15-22","DOI:10.4018/JOEUC.2020070102"],"references":["335938628_Transformative_Effects_of_IoT_Blockchain_and_Artificial_Intelligence_on_Cloud_Computing_Evolution_Vision_Trends_and_Open_Challenges","324455579_SECURE_Self-Protection_Approach_in_Cloud_Resource_Management","322598583_Resource_Provisioning_Based_Scheduling_Framework_for_Execution_of_Heterogeneous_and_Clustered_Workloads_in_Clouds_from_Fundamental_to_Autonomic_Offering","321719192_A_Taxonomy_and_Future_Directions_for_Sustainable_Cloud_Computing_360_Degree_View","318841084_CHOPPER_an_intelligent_QoS-aware_autonomic_resource_management_approach_for_cloud_computing","318671352_Next_Generation_Cloud_Computing_New_Trends_and_Research_Directions","312101036_STAR_SLA-aware_Autonomic_Management_of_Cloud_Resources","287974031_QoS-Aware_Autonomic_Resource_Management_in_Cloud_Computing_A_Systematic_Review","271501833_Consistency_verification_and_quality_assurance_CVQA_traceability_framework_for_SaaS","241279418_A_trust_model_of_cloud_computing_based_on_Quality_of_Service","317129397_Mobility-Aware_Application_Scheduling_in_Fog_Computing","312047349_SA-EAST_Security-Aware_Efficient_Data_Transmission_for_ITS_in_Mobile_Heterogeneous_Cloud_Computing","309127293_Secure_Management_of_Virtualized_Resources","288713585_DDoS_Attacks_in_Cloud_Computing_Issues_Taxonomy_and_Future_Directions","273329094_Towards_Malware_Inspired_Cloud_Self-Protection","235007601_VESPA_Multi-Layered_Self-Protection_for_Cloud_Resources","220085256_Self-Protection_against_Attacks_in_an_Autonomic_Computing_Environment","220068612_IS_Security_Policy_Violations_A_Rational_Choice_Perspective","50357314_Towards_a_Self-Adaptive_Data_Management_System_for_Cloud_Environments"]}
