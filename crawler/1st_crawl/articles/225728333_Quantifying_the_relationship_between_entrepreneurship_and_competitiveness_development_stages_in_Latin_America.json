{"id":"225728333_Quantifying_the_relationship_between_entrepreneurship_and_competitiveness_development_stages_in_Latin_America","abstract":"This research aims to quantify the importance of a country’s entrepreneurship level in terms of its competitiveness rates.\nOur hypothesis is that those countries entrepreneurship growth rates increase their competitiveness indicators and that this\nentrepreneurial improvement could be a key factor in reaching the next stage of development. We establish this relationship\nusing a longitudinal database of Latin American countries that participated in the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) and\nthe Global Competitiveness Reports of the World Economic Forum (WEF) from 2001 to 2006. GEM and WEF construct aggregated indexes\nusing several variables to rate each country’s entrepreneurship activity and competitiveness development. We use a discriminant\nanalysis to identify various countries’ competitiveness subgroups and show how each country’s entrepreneurship rates have\nweight in different stages of competitiveness, placing a special emphasis on Latin America. Our results suggest that Latin\nAmerican countries need to gain entrepreneurial dynamics and economic (and competitiveness) development by transforming their\ntypical self-employment or low value-added new ventures for local markets into strong, innovative networked firms competing\nglobally. Some management and policy implications are also discussed.\n\nKeywordsCompetitiveness–Economic growth–Global Entrepreneurship Monitor–Latin America–Discriminant analysis","authors":["José Ernesto Amorós","Cristóbal Fernández Robin","Tapia Juan"],"meta":["September 2011International Entrepreneurship and Management Journal 8(3):1-22","DOI:10.1007/s11365-010-0165-9","Project: Global Entrepreneurship Monitor"],"references":["273077314_Export_strategies_and_performance_of_firms_from_emerging_economies_Evidence_from_Brazil_Chile_and_Mexico","254421659_Is_Youth_Entrepreneurship_a_Necessity_or_an_Opportunity_A_First_Exploration_of_Household_and_New_Enterprise_Surveys_in_Latin_America","254421292_Entrepreneurship_in_Emerging_Economies_The_Creation_and_Development_of_New_Firms_in_Latin_America_and_East_Asia","247501705_High-growth_SMEs_versus_non-high-growth_SMEs_A_discriminant_analysis","286150196_Entrepreneurs_networks_and_economic_development_A_review_of_recent_research","276942613_What's_New_about_the_New_Economy_Sources_of_Growth_in_the_Managed_and_Entrepreneurial_Economies","271517443_The_Competitive_Advantage_Of_Nations","270411383_Towards_a_Psychology_of_Entrepreneurship_An_Action_Theory_Perspective","265030123_The_Role_of_the_Small_and_Medium_Enterprise_Sector_in_Latin_America_and_Similar_Developing_Economies","256004173_Venture_Entrepreneurship_Innovation_Entrepreneurship_and_Economic_Growth"]}
