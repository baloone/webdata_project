{"id":"346870554_Comparative_analysis_on_the_indicators_from_Latin_American_countries_with_more_scientific_paper_publications_in_the_SIR_Iber_2020","abstract":"The SIR Iber highlights the geographical location of Ibero-American universities by positioning them according to the indicators grouped into three main factors: research, innovation and social impact. The 2020 edition highlights the formation of three groups of countries according to the production capacity of higher education institutions. In group 1 we have: Brazil, Mexico, Chile, Argentina, and Colombia as Latin American countries that managed to publish more than 60,000 papers in the period 2014-2018. This paper analyzes and compares the indicators from the five (05) Latin American countries in group 1 of the SIR Iber 2020 referring to investment in I+S as a percentage of its Gross Domestic Product (PIB), the number of full-time equivalent researchers (Inv JCE), the production (%) of scientific works in the university education sector, to name a few. A conglomerate formed with the Normalized Impact (NI) of public and private IESs is presented, regarding the global average of citation, with the data published in the SIR IBER 2020 Report, and highlights that Chile has a normalized impact above the World average for both public and private IES publications.","authors":["Tito Crissien","Marisabel Luna Cardozo","Carmen VÃ¡squez Stanescu"],"meta":["January 2020Procedia Computer Science 177:245-252","DOI:10.1016/j.procs.2020.10.034"],"references":["336280169_Characterization_of_Latin_American_Universities_in_the_TOP10_of_the_Rankings"]}
