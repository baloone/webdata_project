{"id":"316793760_On_the_mathematics_of_beauty_beautiful_images","abstract":"The question of beauty has inspired scientists and philosophers for centuries, the study of aesthetics today became an active research area in fields as diverse as neuroscience, psychology, and computer science. In this letter, we will study the simplest kind of beauty that can be found in a simple visual pattern and can be appreciated universally. The proposed model suggest that there is a link between beautiful pattern and the Dyson distribution, which seems to be the result of a deeper optimisation process between randomness and regularity. Then we show that beautiful patterns need to satisfy a more fundamental law that seeks to deliver the highest amount of information using the least amount of energy. The proposed model is used to classify and generate beautiful patterns.","authors":["Abdullah Khalili"],"meta":["April 2017"],"references":["315514264_Correlation_Between_Human_Aesthetic_Judgement_and_Spatial_Complexity_Measure","44591974_Beauty_and_the_beholder_Highly_individual_taste_for_abstract_but_not_real-world_images","4246128_The_Design_of_High-Level_Features_for_Photo_Quality_Assessment","316793533_On_the_mathematics_of_beauty_beautiful_music","316493541_Waves_patterns_inside_different_static_and_dynamic_2D_geometrical_structures","273398268_Automated_Aesthetic_Analysis_of_Photographic_Images","271684339_A_Cybernetic_Approach_to_Aesthetics","268903420_Aesthetic_Measure","232558348_The_empirical_determination_of_an_aesthetic_formula","221304720_Studying_Aesthetics_in_Photographic_Images_Using_a_Computational_Approach"]}
