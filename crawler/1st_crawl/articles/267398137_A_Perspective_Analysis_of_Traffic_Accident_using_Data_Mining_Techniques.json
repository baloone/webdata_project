{"id":"267398137_A_Perspective_Analysis_of_Traffic_Accident_using_Data_Mining_Techniques","abstract":"Data Mining is taking out of hidden patterns from huge database. It is commonly used in a marketing, surveillance, fraud detection and scientific discovery. In data mining, machine learning is mainly focused as research which is automatically learnt to recognize complex patterns and make intelligent decisions based on data. Nowadays traffic accidents are the major causes of death and injuries in this world. Roadway patterns are useful in the development of traffic safety control policy. This paper deals with the some of classification models to predict the severity of injury that occurred during traffic accidents. I have compared Naive Bayes Bayesian classifier, AdaBoostM1 Meta classifier, PART Rule classifier, J48 Decision Tree classifier and Random Forest Tree classifier for classifying the type of injury severity of various traffic accidents. The final result shows that the Random Forest outperforms than other four algorithms.","authors":["Krishnaveni .s","M Hemalatha"],"meta":["June 2011International Journal of Computer Applications 23(7)","DOI:10.5120/2896-3788"],"references":["228845263_An_Empirical_Study_of_the_Naive_Bayes_Classifier","2779742_Generating_Accurate_Rule_Sets_Without_Global_Optimization","223620120_Roadway_safety_in_rural_and_small_urbanized_areas","220688794_C45_Programs_for_Machine_Learning","14902736_Modelling_Vehicle_Accidents_and_Highway_Geometric_Design_Relationships","12858349_The_potential_of_rural_mayday_systems_on_vehicular_crash_fatalities","12449602_Injury_trends_of_passenger_car_drivers_in_frontal_crashes_in_the_USA","11087618_The_Independent_Contribution_of_Driver_Crash_and_Vehicle_Characteristics_to_Driver_Fatalities","10775089_Overall_Injury_Risk_to_Different_Drivers_Combining_Exposure_Frequency_and_Severity_Models","7488878_Analysis_and_prediction_of_traffic_fatalities_resulting_from_angle_collisions_including_the_effect_of_vehicles'_configuration_and_compatibility","2578724_On_the_Optimality_of_the_Simple_Bayesian_Classifier_Under_Zero-One_Loss"]}
