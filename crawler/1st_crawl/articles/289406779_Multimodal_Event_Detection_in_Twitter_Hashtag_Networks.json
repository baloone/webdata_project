{"id":"289406779_Multimodal_Event_Detection_in_Twitter_Hashtag_Networks","abstract":"Event detection in a multimodal Twitter dataset is considered. We treat the\nhashtags in the dataset as instances with two modes: text and geolocation\nfeatures. The text feature consists of a bag-of-words representation. The\ngeolocation feature consists of geotags (i.e., geographical coordinates) of the\ntweets. Fusing the multimodal data we aim to detect, in terms of topic and\ngeolocation, the interesting events and the associated hashtags. To this end, a\ngenerative latent variable model is assumed, and a generalized\nexpectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is derived to learn the model\nparameters. The proposed method is computationally efficient, and lends itself\nto big datasets. Experimental results on a Twitter dataset from August 2014\nshow the efficacy of the proposed method.","authors":["Yasin Yilmaz","Alfred Hero"],"meta":["February 2018Journal of Signal Processing Systems 90(2)","DOI:10.1007/s11265-016-1151-4","SourcearXiv"],"references":["281576656_Multimodal_Data_Fusion_Using_Source_Separation_Two_Effective_Models_Based_on_ICA_and_IVA_and_Their_Properties","281454053_Twitter_event_detection_combining_wavelet_analysis_and_topic_inference_summarization","280695940_Multimodal_Factor_Analysis","279632907_Information_Extraction_from_Larger_Multi-layer_Social_Networks","308823236_Information_extraction_from_large_multi-layer_social_networks","305866776_Multimodal_factor_analysis","305067383_Enquiring_Minds_Early_Detection_of_Rumors_in_Social_Media_from_Enquiry_Posts","291737929_Event_detection_in_twitter","287713097_Handbook_of_Mathematical_Functions_with_Formulas_Graphs_and_Mathematical_Tables_US_Department_of_Commerce_Washington_DC","270237822_Modern_Factor_Analysis","262007007_Automatic_Crime_Prediction_Using_Events_Extracted_from_Twitter_Posts","266189530_Modern_Factor_Analysis","265945496_Emoticon_Smoothed_Language_Models_for_Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis","259548215_A_Survey_of_Techniques_for_Event_Detection_in_Twitter","257436121_A_survey_of_multi-view_machine_learning"]}
