{"id":"341776341_Association_of_a_CT-Based_Clinical_and_Radiomics_Score_of_Non-Small_Cell_Lung_Cancer_NSCLC_with_Lymph_Node_Status_and_Overall_Survival","abstract":"Background: \nTo evaluate whether a model based on radiomic and clinical features may be associated with lymph node (LN) status and overall survival (OS) in lung cancer (LC) patients; to evaluate whether CT reconstruction algorithms may influence the model performance.\n\nMethods: \npatients operated on for LC with a pathological stage up to T3N1 were retrospectively selected and divided into training and validation sets. For the prediction of positive LNs and OS, the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) logistic regression model was used; univariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis assessed the association of clinical-radiomic variables and endpoints. All tests were repeated after dividing the groups according to the CT reconstruction algorithm. p-values < 0.05 were considered significant.\n\nResults: \n270 patients were included and divided into training (n = 180) and validation sets (n = 90). Transfissural extension was significantly associated with positive LNs. For OS prediction, high- and low-risk groups were different according to the radiomics score, also after dividing the two groups according to reconstruction algorithms.\n\nConclusions: \na combined clinical-radiomics model was not superior to a single clinical or single radiomics model to predict positive LNs. A radiomics model was able to separate high-risk and low-risk patients for OS; CTs reconstructed with Iterative Reconstructions (IR) algorithm showed the best model performance.","authors":["Francesca Botta","Sara Raimondi","Lisa Rinaldi","Federica Bellerba"],"meta":["May 2020Cancers 12(1432):1432","DOI:10.3390/cancers12061432"],"references":["337963497_Radiomics_predicts_survival_of_patients_with_advanced_non-small_cell_lung_cancer_undergoing_PD-1_blockade_using_Nivolumab","331947985_Lymph_node_metastasis_outside_of_a_tumor-bearing_lobe_in_primary_lung_cancer_and_the_status_of_interlobar_fissures_The_necessity_for_removing_lymph_nodes_from_an_adjacent_lobe","328940833_Radiomics_the_facts_and_the_challenges_of_image_analysis","325021498_Radiomics_of_high-grade_serous_ovarian_cancer_association_between_quantitative_CT_features_residual_tumour_and_disease_progression_within_12_months","298712242_The_IASLC_Lung_Cancer_Staging_Project_Proposals_for_Revision_of_the_TNM_Stage_Groupings_in_the_Forthcoming_Eighth_Edition_of_the_TNM_Classification_for_Lung_Cancer","284170872_Radiomics_Images_Are_More_than_Pictures_They_Are_Data","262789363_ALK_Molecular_Phenotype_in_Non-Small_Cell_Lung_Cancer_CT_Radiogenomic_Characterization","256540556_Radiogenomics_of_Clear_Cell_Renal_Cell_Carcinoma_Associations_between_CT_Imaging_Features_and_Mutations","227857947_Non-Small_Cell_Lung_Cancer_Identifying_Prognostic_Imaging_Biomarkers_by_Leveraging_Public_Gene_Expression_Microarray_Data-Methods_and_Preliminary_Results","51036331_Optimally_splitting_cases_for_training_and_testing_high_dimensional_classifiers","6316528_Decoding_gobal_gene_expression_programs_in_liver_cancer_by_noninvasive_imaging","5490698_Identification_of_noninvasive_imaging_surrogates_for_brain_tumor_gene-expression_modules","338460716_Cancer_statistics_2020","325867854_Radiomics_nomogram_outperforms_size_criteria_in_discriminating_lymph_node_metastasis_in_resectable_esophageal_squamous_cell_carcinoma","324592222_A_new_approach_to_predict_lymph_node_metastasis_in_solid_lung_adenocarcinoma_A_radiomics_nomogram","324266062_Prediction_of_pathological_nodal_involvement_by_CT-based_Radiomic_features_of_the_primary_tumor_in_patients_with_clinically_node-negative_peripheral_lung_adenocarcinomas","320198316_Radiomics_The_bridge_between_medical_imaging_and_personalized_medicine","314726787_Radiogenomics_of_Clear_Cell_Renal_Cell_Carcinoma_Associations_between_CT_Imaging_Features_and_Mutations","276066736_CT_Radiogenomic_Characterization_of_EGFR_K-RAS_and_ALK_Mutations_in_Non-Small_Cell_Lung_Cancer","273152840_IBEX_an_open_infrastructure_software_platform_to_facilitate_collaborative_work_in_radiomics","49856533_Predicting_prolonged_air_leak_after_standard_pulmonary_lobectomy_Computed_tomography_assessment_and_risk_factors_stratification","49849376_Randomized_trial_of_mediastinal_lymph_node_sampling_versus_complete_lymphadenectomy_during_pulmonary_resection_in_the_patient_with_N0_or_N1_less_than_hilar_non-small_cell_carcinoma_Results_of_the_Amer","19953429_Comparing_the_Areas_under_Two_or_More_Correlated_Receiver_Operating_Characteristic_Curves_A_Nonparametric_Approach","7580263_CT_Images_of_Abdomen_and_Pelvis_Effect_of_Nonlinear_Three-dimensional_Optimized_Reconstruction_Algorithm_on_Image_Quality_and_Lesion_Characteristics_1","7580262_Chest_CT_Performed_with_Z-Axis_Modulation_Scanning_Protocol_and_Radiation_Dose1","6229185_Radiogenomic_Analysis_to_Identify_Imaging_Phenotypes_Associated_with_Drug_Response_Gene_Expression_Programs_in_Hepatocellular_Carcinoma","5394953_Complete_mediastinal_lymphadenectomy_The_core_component_of_the_multidisciplinary_therapy_in_resectable_non-small_cell_lung_cancer","5207424_Concordance_Probability_and_Discriminatory_Power_in_Proportional_Hazards_Regression"]}
