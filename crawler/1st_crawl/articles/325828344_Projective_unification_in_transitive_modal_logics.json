{"id":"325828344_Projective_unification_in_transitive_modal_logics","abstract":"We show that a transitive normal modal logic L enjoys projective unification (i.e. each unifiable formula is projective) if and only if L contains K4D1 ($${\\textsf{D1}}\\colon \\Box (\\Box x \\to y)\\lor \\Box (\\Box y \\to x)$$). It means, in particular, that K4D1 (and any of its extensions) is almost structurally complete, i.e. the logic is complete with respect to all non-passive admissible rules. We also characterize non-unifiable formulas and provide an explicit form of the basis for all passive rules over $${\\textsf{K4G}} + \\Box (\\Box x\\to x).","authors":["SÅ‚awomir Kost"],"meta":["June 2018Logic Journal of IGPL 26(5)","DOI:10.1093/jigpal/jzy013"],"references":["265644278_Remarks_on_projective_unifiers","260340266_Almost_structural_completeness_an_algebraic_approach","220245506_Projective_unification_in_modal_logic","220245362_Unification_in_modal_and_description_logics","31492449_Unifiability_in_extensions_of_K4","268968561_STructural_completeness_of_the_propositional_calculus_II","268307289_An_essay_on_unification_and_inference_rules_for_modal_logics","222199248_Best_solving_modal_equations"]}
