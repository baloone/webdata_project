{"id":"276442290_Defining_user_experience_goals_to_guide_the_design_of_industrial_systems","abstract":"The key prerequisite for experience-driven design is to define what experience to design for. User experience (UX) goals concretise the intended experience. Based on our own case studies from industrial environments and a literature study, we propose five different approaches to acquiring insight and inspiration for UX goal setting: Brand, Theory, Empathy, Technology, and Vision. Each approach brings in a different viewpoint, thus supporting the multidisciplinary character of UX. The Brand approach ensures that the UX goals are in line with the company's brand promise. The Theory approach utilises the available scientific knowledge of human behaviour. The Empathy approach focuses on knowing the actual users and stepping into their shoes. The Technology approach considers the new technologies that are being introduced and their positive or negative influence on UX. Finally, the Vision approach focuses on renewal, introducing new kinds of UXs. In the design of industrial systems, several stakeholders are involved and they should share common design goals. Using the different UX goal-setting approaches together brings in the viewpoints of different stakeholders, thus committing them to UX goal setting and emphasising UX as a strategic design decision.","authors":["Eija Kaasinen","Virpi Roto","Jaakko Hakulinen","Tomi Heimonen"],"meta":["May 2015Behaviour and Information Technology 34(10):1-16","DOI:10.1080/0144929X.2015.1035335","Project: FIMECC UXUS"],"references":["318379439_Acting_Under_Uncertainty_-_The_Core-Task_Analysis_in_Ecological_Study_of_Work","279658682_Beyond_Users_Grounding_Technology_in_Experience","271767271_Beyond_Kansei_Engineering_The_Emancipation_of_Kansei_Design","269689779_A_User-Centric_View_of_Intelligent_Environments_User_Expectations_User_Experience_and_User_Role_in_Building_Intelligent_Environments","268337678_User_Psychology_Re-assessing_the_Boundaries_of_a_Discipline","257457954_Expected_user_experience_of_mobile_augmented_reality_services_A_user_study_in_the_context_of_shopping_centres","257018994_Designing_Gesture-Based_Control_for_Factory_Automation","252134207_User_Experience_Elements_and_Brand_Promise","249791358_Pastiche_scenarios_fiction_as_a_resource_for_experience_centred_design","245326242_A_framework_for_empathy_in_design_Stepping_into_and_out_of_the_user's_life","242084991_Understanding_playful_user_experiences_through_digital_games","239554066_Design_for_experiencing_new_tools","239491657_Data_analysis_for_the_Critical_Decision_Method","235701126_The_Use_of_Stories_in_User_Experience_Design","235700959_Framework_of_Product_Experience","235700862_Co-creation_and_the_New_Landscapes_of_Design","234817583_PLEX_Cards_A_source_of_inspiration_when_designing_for_playfulness","233864602_User_experience_-_A_research_agenda","233864554_Needs_affect_and_interactive_products-Facets_of_user_experience","229802344_The_forgotten_bond_Brand_identity_and_product_design","228426320_Laddering_the_User_Experience","228350252_Understanding_users'_experience_of_interaction","226420570_The_Thing_and_I_Understanding_the_Relationship_Between_User_and_Product","224927652_Emotional_Design_Why_We_Love_or_Hate_Everyday_Things","311909591_Designing_gesture-based_control_for_factory_automation","292765298_Sketching_User_Experience_Getting_the_Design_Right_and_the_Right_Design","289140506_Towards_meaning_change_Experience_goals_driving_design_space_expansion","288225498_Towards_a_conceptual_framework_for_experience-driven_innovation","281665452_The_UX_Book_Process_and_Guidelines_for_Ensuring_a_Quality_User_Experience","273947524_Interaction_Design_Beyond_Human-Computer_Interaction","271573697_User_experience_does_it_matter_in_complex_systems","267788312_Ergonomics_of_Wearability_as_a_Design_Driver_A_Case_Study_of_User-Centered_Design_Process_of_Designing_Mobile_Phones_and_Accessories_for_Active_Use","266339174_Empathy_Probes","262395355_Mobile_Interaction_with_Elevators_Improving_People_Flow_in_Complex_Buildings","262358384_User_experience_targets_as_design_drivers_A_case_study_on_the_development_of_a_remote_crane_operator_station","262211714_Enhancing_the_user_experience_of_the_crane_operator_Comparing_work_demands_in_two_operational_settings","261854098_Emotional_Dimensions_of_User_Experience_A_User_Psychological_Analysis","257480334_Systems_usability_framework_for_evaluating_tools_in_safety-critical_work","254005523_Informing_user_experience_design_about_users_insights_from_practice","251515519_Customer_Integration_within_Service_Development_-_A_Review_of_Methods_and_an_Analysis_of_Insitu_and_Exsitu_Contributions","250956985_Emotional_Design","248504444_Sketching_Designing_User_Experiences_Getting_the_Design_Right_and_the_Right_Design","246496617_Interaction_Design_Beyond_HCI","243973323_Identifying_competitive_customer_value_propositions_in_retailing","238742478_Designing_Pleasurable_Products_An_Introduction_to_the_New_Human_Factors","235701020_Product_Concept_Design_A_Review_of_the_Conceptual_Design_of_Products_in_Industry","235700851_Frog_Form_follows_emotion","232166572_Opportunities_and_Challenges_of_Designing_the_Service_User_eXperience_SUX_in_Web_20","227183258_Making_Sense_of_Experience","223789557_Pastiche_scenarios_Fiction_as_a_resource_for_user_centred_design_Interacting_with_Computers_185_1139-1164","221518375_Understanding_scoping_and_defining_user_experience_A_survey_approach","221515988_Empathy_and_experience_in_HCI","221502443_Designing_for_user_experience_What_to_expect_from_mobile_3D_TV_and_video","221441576_From_user_to_character_an_investigation_into_user-descriptions_in_scenarios","221441485_Understanding_experience_in_interactive_systems"]}
