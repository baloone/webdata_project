{"id":"303475617_Malayalam_Phonology_Segmentals","abstract":"No theory of language can be properly evaluated without fully worked-out grammars that make use of the theory in handling a complex body of interacting phenomena. In chapter II, I tried to provide such a body of data and analyses from English, against which the theory of Lexical Phonology may be judged. In chapters III and IV, I explore a different language, namely, Malayalam, a Dravidian language spoken in Southern India.","authors":["Karuvannur Puthanveettil Mohanan"],"meta":["January 1986","DOI:10.1007/978-94-009-3719-2_3","In book: The Theory of Lexical Phonology (pp.63-108)"],"references":[]}
