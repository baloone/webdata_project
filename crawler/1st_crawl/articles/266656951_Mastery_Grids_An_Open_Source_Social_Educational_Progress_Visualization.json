{"id":"266656951_Mastery_Grids_An_Open_Source_Social_Educational_Progress_Visualization","abstract":"While many pieces of educational software used in the classroom have been found to positively affect learning, they often are underused by students. Open learning model and social visualization are two approaches which have been helpful in ameliorating that low usage problem. This article introduces a fusion of these two ideas in a form of social progress visualization. A classroom evaluation indicates that this combination may be effective in engaging students, guiding them to suitable content, and enabling faster content access.\n\nTomasz D., Julio Guerra, Roya Hosseini, Peter Brusilovsky","authors":["Tomasz Loboda","Julio Guerra","Roya Hosseini","Peter Brusilovsky"],"meta":["September 2014","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-11200-8_18","Conference: 9th European Conference on Technology Enhanced Learning, EC-TEL 2014At: Graz, Austria"],"references":["311474855_An_open_integrated_exploratorium_for_database_courses","259781741_Progressor_Social_navigation_support_through_open_social_student_modeling","235663648_Problem_Solving_Examples_as_First_Class_Objects_in_Educational_Digital_Libraries_Three_Obstacles_to_Overcome","229860609_Using_Community_Visualization_to_Stimulate_Participation_in_Online_Communities","229674759_Guiding_students_to_the_right_questions_Adaptive_navigation_support_in_an_E-Learning_system_for_Java_programming","220807401_An_open_integrated_exploratorium_for_database_courses","220612962_Evaluating_the_Educational_Impact_of_Visualization_Report_of_the_Working_Group_on_Evaluating_the_Educational_Impact_of_Visualization","220265638_Adaptation_in_the_Context_of_Explanatory_Visualization","262317857_Student_Models_that_Invite_the_Learner_In_The_SMILI_Open_Learner_Modelling_Framework","225230788_Knowledge_tracing_Modeling_the_acquisition_of_procedural_knowledge"]}
