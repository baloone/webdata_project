{"id":"296635903_The_Whale_Optimization_Algorithm","abstract":"This paper proposes a novel nature-inspired meta-heuristic optimization algorithm, called Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), which mimics the social behavior of humpback whales. The algorithm is inspired by the bubble-net hunting strategy. WOA is tested with 29 mathematical optimization problems and 6 structural design problems. Optimization results prove that the WOA algorithm is very competitive compared to the state-of-art meta-heuristic algorithms as well as conventional methods. The source codes of the WOA algorithm are publicly available at http://www.alimirjalili.com/WOA.html.","authors":["Seyedali Mirjalili","Andrew Lewis"],"meta":["May 2016","DOI:10.1016/j.advengsoft.2016.01.008","Project: Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA): theories, variants, and applications"],"references":["308953674_Ant_Colony_Optimization","288737434_Advances_in_Metaheuristic_Algorithms_for_Optimal_Design_of_Structures","277474071_Tabu_search-part_II","276037871_Soccer_League_Competition_Algorithm_a_New_Method_for_Solving_Systems_of_Nonlinear_Equations","260270202_Soccer_League_Competition_Algorithm_A_Novel_Meta-heuristic_Algorithm_For_Optimal_Design_of_Water_Distribution_Networks","260010809_Grey_Wolf_Optimizer","259729010_Integrative_Approaches_to_the_Study_of_Baleen_Whale_Diving_Behavior_Feeding_Performance_and_Foraging_Ecology","257424785_A_new_optimization_method_Dolphin_echolocation","245440213_Central_force_optimization_A_new_metaheuristic_with_applications_in_applied_electromagnetics","236030354_Krill_Herd_Algorithm_A_New_Bio-Inspired_Optimization_Algorithm","235979455_Nature-Inspired_Metaheuristic_Algorithms","313151683_Test_functions_for_optimization_needs","312004730_Advances_in_Metaheuristic_Algorithms_for_Optimal_Design_of_Structures","304425270_Differential_Evolution_-_A_Simple_and_Efficient_Heuristic_for_global_Optimization_over_Continuous_Spaces","292644048_Fireworks_algorithm_A_novel_swarm_intelligence_optimization_method","291249072_Artificial_Intelligence_through_Simulated_Evolution","291047084_Use_of_a_self-adaptive_penalty_approach_for_engineering_optimization_problems","286032249_Application_of_improved_hybrid_genetic_algorithm_to_optimized_design_of_architecture_structures","285856879_An_efficient_constraint_handling_method_for_genetic_algorithms","285237745_DE-a_simple_and_efficient_heuristic_for_global_optimization_over_continuous_space","279370545_Colliding_Bodies_Optimization","273453883_Particle_Swarm_Optimization","271790861_Aerial_Observation_of_Feeding_Behavior_in_Four_Baleen_Whales_Eubalaena_glacialis_Balaenoptera_borealis_Megaptera_novaeangliae_and_Balaenoptera_physalus","271644099_Introduction_To_Optimum_Design","270979622_Group_counseling_optimization","264600116_A_new_heuristic_optimization_algorithm_for_modeling_of_proton_exchange_membrane_fuel_cell_Bird_mating_optimizer","262227023_Symbiotic_Organisms_Search_A_new_metaheuristic_optimization_algorithm","262227019_Colliding_bodies_optimization_A_novel_meta-heuristic_method","262064428_Structure_of_the_cerebral_cortex_of_the_humpback_whaleMegaptera_novaeangliae_Cetacea_Mysticeti_Balaenopteridae","262016786_Interior_search_algorithm_ISA_A_novel_approach_for_global_optimization","260805250_Exchange_market_algorithm","259022192_Genetic_Algorithms","257929370_Chaotic_Swarming_of_Particle_A_New_Method_for_Size_Optimization_of_Truss_Structures","257635575_Social-Based_Algorithm_SBA","256919424_A_new_meta-heuristic_method_Ray_Optimization","256721167_Black_hole_A_new_heuristic_optimization_approach_for_data_clustering","251621461_A_new_Fruit_Fly_Optimization_Algorithm_Taking_the_financial_distress_model_as_an_example","250697448_A_heuristic_particle_swarm_optimization_method_for_truss_structures_with_discrete_variables","249480698_Auto-tuning_strategy_for_evolutionary_algorithms_Balancing_between_exploration_and_exploitation","245310596_The_harmony_search_heuristic_algorithm_for_discrete_structural_optimization","245310469_On_methods_for_discrete_structural_optimization","245304699_Design_of_Space_Trusses_Using_Ant_Colony_Optimization","245097600_A_particle_swarm_ant_colony_optimization_for_truss_structures_with_discrete_variables","243766735_An_Augmented_Lagrange_Multiplier_Based_Method_for_Mixed_Integer_Discrete_Continuous_Optimization_and_Its_Applications_to_Mechanical_Design","243766612_Optimal_Design_of_a_Class_of_Welded_Structures_Using_Geometric_Programming","243764388_Optimal_design_of_a_welded_beam_via_genetic_algorithms","243764068_Discrete_optimization_of_structures_using_genetic_algorithms_J_Struct_Eng_ASCE","243666463_Nonlinear_Integer_and_Discrete_Programming_in_Mechanical_Design_Optimization","241219595_Monkey_search_A_novel_metaheuristic_search_for_global_optimization","239060344_A_Study_of_Mathematical_Programming_Methods_for_Structural_Optimization","235786891_Mine_blast_algorithm_A_new_population_based_algorithm_for_solving_constrained_engineering_optimization_problems","235710019_Problem_Definitions_and_Evaluation_Criteria_for_the_CEC_2005_Special_Session_on_Real-Parameter_Optimization","230648876_Curved_Space_Optimization_A_Random_Search_based_on_General_RelativityTheory","235264675_An_improved_ant_colony_optimization_for_constrained_engineering_design_problems","232633808_League_Championship_Algorithm_A_New_Algorithm_for_Numerical_Function_Optimization"]}
