{"id":"336693758_Path_querying_on_acyclic_graphs_using_Boolean_grammars","abstract":"Graph data models are widely used in different areas of computer science such as bioinformatics, graph databases, social networks and static code analysis. One of the problems in graph data analysis is querying for specific paths. Such queries are usually performed by means of a formal grammar that describes the allowed edge-labeling of the paths. Path query is said to be calculated using relational query semantics if it is evaluated to triple ((A,v1,v2), such that there is a path from v1 to v2 such that the labels on the edges of this path form a string derivable from the nonterminal A. As the regular and context-free languages have limited expressive power, we focus on a more expressive languages, namely the Boolean languages that use Boolean grammars to describe the labeling of paths. Although path querying using relational query semantics and Boolean grammars is known to be undecidable, in this work we propose a path querying algorithm on acyclic graphs which uses relational query semantics and Boolean grammars and approximates the exact solution. To achieve better performance in compare with the naive algorithm, considered classes of graphs were limited to acyclic graphs.","authors":["Ekaterina Shemetova","Semyon Grigorev"],"meta":["October 2019Proceedings of the Institute for System Programming of RAS 31(4):211-226","DOI:10.15514/ISPRAS-2019-31(4)-14","Project: YaccConstructor"],"references":["325588881_Context-free_path_querying_by_matrix_multiplication","322260219_Context-free_path_querying_with_structural_representation_of_result","304462174_Role_of_graph_databases_in_social_networks","301335208_Regular_Queries_on_Graph_Databases","326163370_Efficient_evaluation_of_context-free_path_queries_for_graph_databases","312013434_Context-sensitive_data-dependence_analysis_via_linear_conjunctive_language_reachability","308569065_Context-Free_Path_Queries_on_RDF_Graphs","272422996_Exploring_Hierarchies_in_Online_Social_Networks","262289301_Multiplying_matrices_faster_than_Coppersmith-Winograd","259513676_Parsing_by_matrix_multiplication_generalized_to_Boolean_grammars","236601217_Quantifying_variances_in_comparative_RNA_secondary_structure_prediction","224008187_Regular_Path_Queries_on_Large_Graphs","221320854_Demand-driven_points-to_analysis_for_Java","222796853_General_Context-Free_Recognition_in_Less_than_Cubic_Time","221499790_Depth-First_Search_and_Linear_Graph_Algorithms_Working_Paper"]}
