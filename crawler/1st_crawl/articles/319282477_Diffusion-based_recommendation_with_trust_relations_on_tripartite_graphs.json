{"id":"319282477_Diffusion-based_recommendation_with_trust_relations_on_tripartite_graphs","abstract":"The diffusion-based recommendation approach is a vital branch in recommender systems, which successfully applies physical dynamics to make recommendations for users on bipartite or tripartite graphs. Trust links indicate users' social relations and can provide the benefit of reducing data sparsity. However, traditional diffusion-based algorithms only consider rating links when making recommendations. In this paper, the complementarity of users' implicit and explicit trust is exploited, and a novel resource-allocation strategy is proposed, which integrates these two kinds of trust relations on tripartite graphs. Through empirical studies on three benchmark datasets, our proposed method obtains better performance than most of the benchmark algorithms in terms of accuracy, diversity and novelty. According to the experimental results, our method is an effective and reasonable way to integrate additional features into the diffusion-based recommendation approach.","authors":["Ximeng Wang","Yun Liu","Guangquan Zhang","Fei Xiong"],"meta":["August 2017Journal of Statistical Mechanics Theory and Experiment 2017(8):083405","DOI:10.1088/1742-5468/aa8189"],"references":["309237237_A_vertex_similarity_index_for_better_personalized_recommendation","286932821_Unified_YouTube_Video_Recommendation_via_Cross-network_Collaboration","273392729_Spatio-Temporal_Video_Segmentation_of_Static_Scenes_and_Its_Applications","262219034_FISM_factored_item_similarity_models_for_top-N_recommender_systems","233763743_On_the_Evolution_of_the_Internet_Economic_Ecosystem","231081362_Effect_of_initial_configuration_on_network-based_recommendation","222663135_Collaborative_filtering_with_diffusion-based_similarity_on_tripartite_graphs","220426798_Fab_Content-Based_Collaborative_Recommendation","51781000_Information_filtering_via_biased_heat_conduction","41532378_Solving_the_apparent_diversity-accuracy_dilemma_of_recommender_systems","5852039_Heat_Conduction_Process_on_Community_Networks_as_a_Recommendation_Model","5851936_Bipartite_network_projection_and_personal_recommendation","317080079_Timeliness_in_recommender_systems","310823634_Global_and_Local_Influence-based_Social_Recommendation","309050738_Unified_youtube_video_recommendation_via_cross-network_collaboration","303992988_The_essential_role_of_time_in_network-based_recommendation","303353891_Member_Contribution-based_Group_Recommender_System","303293748_User_Preference_Learning_for_Online_Social_Recommendation","302982319_Improving_Collaborative_Recommendation_via_User-Item_Subgroups","301234940_Improved_personalized_recommendation_based_on_a_similarity_network","301222357_Toward_the_next_generation_of_recommender_systems_A_survey_of_the_state-of-the-art_and_possible_extensions","295084157_Transfer_Learning_for_Heterogeneous_One-Class_Collaborative_Filtering","294107078_A_Novel_Recommendation_Model_Regularized_with_User_Trust_and_Item_Ratings","284218886_Network-based_recommendation_algorithms_A_review","282985317_Exploring_user_emotion_in_microblogs_for_music_recommendation","274903035_Recommender_System_Application_Developments_A_Survey","273395718_A_Fuzzy_Preference_Tree-Based_Recommender_System_for_Personalized_Business-to-Business_E-Services","273161756_Trust_Evolution_Modeling_and_Its_Applications","262416206_Personalized_recommendation_with_corrected_similarity","260799584_Information_filtering_by_similarity-preferential_diffusion_processes","257191401_An_information_diffusion_model_based_on_retweeting_mechanism_for_online_social_media","243220699_A_new_weighting_method_in_network-based_recommendation","234794211_Recommender_Systems_Handbook","224574578_Matrix_factorization_techniques_for_recommender_systems_IEEE_Computer_Journal_428_30-37","222556578_Personalized_recommendation_via_integrated_diffusion_on_user-item-tag_tripartite_graphsJ","222524627_Personal_Recommendation_via_Modified_Collaborative_Filtering","221662122_Recommender_Systems","220515859_Rank-biased_precision_for_measurement_of_retrieval"]}
