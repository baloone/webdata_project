In this article, I demonstrate that both issues discussed by Hayduk and Glaser are actually not problems at all. The first \"problem\" derives from a false premise by Hayduk and Glaser that Steiger (1995) specifically warned about in an earlier publication. The second so-called problem results from the point estimate satisfying a fundamental property of a good estimator and can be shown to have virtually no negative implications for statistical practice.","authors":["James H Steiger"],"meta":["June 2000Structural Equation Modeling A Multidisciplinary Journal 7(2):149-162","DOI:10.1207/S15328007SEM0702_1"],"references":["38366915_Unbiased_Estimation_of_Certain_Correlation_Coefficients","320928699_Structural_Equation_Modeling","289963792_Noncentrality_Interval_Estimation_and_the_Evaluation_of_Statistical_Models","289962900_Noncentrality_Interval_Estimation_and_the_Evaluation_of_Statistical_Models","274566373_Statistical_Power_Analysis","247410202_Power_Analysis_and_Determination_of_Sample_Size_for_Covariance_Structure_Modeling","243573429_The_Advanced_Theory_of_Statistics","243043644_Jiving_the_Four-Step_Waltzing_Around_Factor_Analysis_and_Other_Serious_Fun","232477921_The_advanced_theory_of_statistics_Vols_II_and_III","24062667_On_the_Multivariate_Asymptotic_Distribution_of_Sequential_Chi-Square_Statistics"]}
