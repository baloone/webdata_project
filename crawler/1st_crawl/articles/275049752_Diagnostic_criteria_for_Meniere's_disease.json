{"id":"275049752_Diagnostic_criteria_for_Meniere's_disease","abstract":"This paper presents diagnostic criteria for Menière's disease jointly formulated by the Classification Committee of the Bárány Society, The Japan Society for Equilibrium Research, the European Academy of Otology and Neurotology (EAONO), the Equilibrium Committee of the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) and the Korean Balance Society. The classification includes two categories: definite Menière's disease and probable Menière's disease. The diagnosis of definite Menière's disease is based on clinical criteria and requires the observation of an episodic vertigo syndrome associated with low- to medium-frequency sensorineural hearing loss and fluctuating aural symptoms (hearing, tinnitus and/or fullness) in the affected ear. Duration of vertigo episodes is limited to a period between 20 minutes and 12 hours. Probable Menière's disease is a broader concept defined by episodic vestibular symptoms (vertigo or dizziness) associated with fluctuating aural symptoms occurring in a period from 20 minutes to 24 hours.","authors":["Jose A Lopez-Escamez","John Carey","Won-Ho Chung","Joel Goebel"],"meta":["April 2015Journal of Vestibular Research 25(1):1-7","DOI:10.3233/VES-150549","SourcePubMed"],"references":["271075521_Electrocochleography_for_Meniere's_disease_is_it_reliable","266743788_Identification_of_two_novel_mutations_in_FAM136A_and_DTNA_genes_in_autosomal-dominant_familial_Meniere's_disease","257754485_Endolymphatic_hydrops_in_patients_with_vestibular_migraine_and_auditory_symptoms","235650430_Meniere's_disease_A_reappraisal_supported_by_a_variable_latency_of_symptoms_and_the_MRI_visualisation_of_endolymphatic_hydrops","233395038_Vestibular_migraine_Diagnostic_criteria","278922079_Committee_on_Hearing_and_Equilibrium_Guidelines_for_the_Diagnosis_and_Evaluation_of_Therapy_in_Meniere's_Disease_Otolaryngol_Head_Neck_Surg_1995_113181-185","261735616_Prevalence_Associated_Factors_and_Comorbid_Conditions_for_Meniere's_Disease","255177895_Innate_Immune_Recognition_of_Molds_and_Homology_to_the_Inner_Ear_Protein_Cochlin_in_Patients_with_Autoimmune_Inner_Ear_Disease","236072965_Familial_clustering_and_genetic_heterogeneity_in_Meniere's_disease","236018481_High_incidence_of_Meniere-like_symptoms_in_relatives_of_Meniere_patients_in_the_areas_of_Oulu_University_Hospital_and_Kainuu_Central_Hospital_in_Finland"]}
