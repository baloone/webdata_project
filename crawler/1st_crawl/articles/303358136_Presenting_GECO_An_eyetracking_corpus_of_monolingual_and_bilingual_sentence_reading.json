{"id":"303358136_Presenting_GECO_An_eyetracking_corpus_of_monolingual_and_bilingual_sentence_reading","abstract":"This article introduces GECO, the Ghent Eye-Tracking Corpus, a monolingual and bilingual corpus of the eyetracking data of participants reading a complete novel. English monolinguals and Dutchâ€“English bilinguals read an entire novel, which was presented in paragraphs on the screen. The bilinguals read half of the novel in their first language, and the other half in their second language. In this article, we describe the distributions and descriptive statistics of the most important reading time measures for the two groups of participants. This large eyetracking corpus is perfectly suited for both exploratory purposes and more directed hypothesis testing, and it can guide the formulation of ideas and theories about naturalistic reading processes in a meaningful context. Most importantly, this corpus has the potential to evaluate the generalizability of monolingual and bilingual language theories and models to the reading of long texts and narratives. The corpus is freely available at http:// expsy. ugent. be/ downloads/ geco.","authors":["Uschi Cop","Nicolas Dirix","Denis Drieghe","Wouter Duyck"],"meta":["May 2016Behavior Research Methods
