{"id":"311999399_Robotics_in_School_Chemistry_Laboratories","abstract":"This paper proposes an approach to integrated learning of robotics and chemistry implemented in a laboratory course, in which high school students majoring in mechanical engineering are involved in the development of laboratory robotic devices and use them for chemical experiments. We consider learning activities at different stages of the course and characterize studentsâ€™ engagement along the stages.","authors":["Igor M. Verner","Leonid B.
