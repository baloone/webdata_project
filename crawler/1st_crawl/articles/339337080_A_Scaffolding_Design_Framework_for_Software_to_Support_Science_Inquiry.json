{"id":"339337080_A_Scaffolding_Design_Framework_for_Software_to_Support_Science_Inquiry","abstract":"The notion of scaffolding learners to help them succeed in solving problems other- wise too difficult for them is an important idea that has extended into the design of scaffolded software tools for learners. However, although there is a growing body of work on scaffolded tools, scaffold design, and the impact of scaffolding, the field has not yet converged on a common theoretical framework that defines rationales and approaches to guide the design of scaffolded tools. In this article, we present a scaffold- ing design framework addressing scaffolded software tools for science inquiry. Developed through iterative cycles of inductive and theory-based analysis, the framework synthesizes the work of prior design efforts, theoretical arguments, and empirical work in a set of guidelines that are organized around science inquiry practices and the challenges learners face in those practices. The framework can provide a basis for developing a theory of pedagogical support and a mechanism to describe successful scaffolding approaches. It can also guide design, not in a prescriptive manner but by providing designers with heuristics and examples of possible ways to address the challenges learners face.","authors":["Chris Quintana","Brian J Reiser","Elizabeth A Davis","Joseph Krajcik"],"meta":["November 2009Journal of the Learning Sciences 13(3):337-386"],"references":["330115028_Reading_Images-The_Grammar_of_Visual_Design","313745906_SimCalc_Accelerating_students'_engagement_with_the_mathematics_of_change","313056846_Students'_transition_from_an_engineering_model_to_a_science_model_of_experimentation","312911990_BGuILE_Strategic_and_conceptual_scaffolds_for_scientific_inquiry_in_biology_classrooms","280780729_Scientific_arguments_as_learning_artifacts_Designing_for_learning_from_the_web_with_KIE","268016512_Theory_and_Practice_of_Case-Based_Learning_Aids","248942053_Causal_Models_and_Experimentation_Strategies_in_Scientific_Reasoning","247502531_Inquiry_Modeling_and_Metacognition_Making_Science_Accessible_to_All_Students","243680991_Learning_communities_in_classrooms_A_reconceptualization_of_educational_practice","240412645_What''s_all_the_fuss_about_metacognition","237035032_Open_Learning_Environments_Foundations_methods_and_models","326562023_Teaching_Science_in_Elementary_and_Middle_School_A_Project-Based_Learning_Approach","318494438_Flow_the_psychology_of_optimal_experience","317953561_Mind_in_society_The_development_of_higher_psychological_processes","317953505_Situated_learning_Legitimate_peripheral_participation","313749839_Designing_educational_technology_Computer-mediated_change_in_Nardi_B_A_ed_Context_and_consciousness_Activity_theory_and_human-computer_interaction_Cambridge","313552659_Situations_mental_models_and_generative_knowledge","313475155_Guided_Discovery_in_a_Community_of_Learners","313063903_Models_of_Competence_in_Solving_Physics_Problems","304958481_Restructuring_the_Classroom_Conditions_for_Productive_Small_Groups","303270804_Cognitive_apprenticeship_Teaching_the_crafts_of_reading_writing_mathematics","298837845_The_metaphor_of_scaffolding_Its_utility_for_the_field_of_learning_disabilities","285032643_Knowing_learning_and_instruction_Essays_in_honor_of_Robert_Glaser","281272065_The_MORE_Thinking_Frame_Guiding_students'_thinking_in_the_laboratory","279933427_Learning-for-Use_A_Framework_for_the_Design_of_Technology-Supported_Inquiry_Activities","279120316_Addressing_the_Challenges_of_Inquiry-Based_Learning_Through_Technology_and_Curriculum_Design","271429465_Cognitive_Apprenticeship_Teaching_the_Craft_of_Reading_Writing_and_Mathematics","262284000_Evolution_hypermedia_learning_environments_and_conceptual_change_a_preliminary_report","262008071_Designing_Interaction_Psychology_at_the_Human-Computer_Interface","261620472_Creating_Usable_Innovations_in_Systemic_Reform_Scaling_Up_Technology-Embedded_Project-Based_Science_in_Urban_Schools","257925990_How_People_Learn_Mind_Brain_Experience_and_School","254346746_The_Effects_of_Self-Monitoring_on_Students'_Course_Performance_Use_of_Learning_Strategies_Attitude_Self-Judgment_Ability_and_Knowledge_Representation","248975102_Scaffolding_students'_knowledge_integration_Prompts_for_reflection_in_KIE","248258910_Using_bridging_analogies_and_anchoring_intuitions_to_deal_with_preconceptions_in_physics","248056274_The_Uses_of_Argument","247767835_The_Architecture_Of_Cognition","247698172_Talking_Their_Way_Into_Science","246701416_Linking_models_to_data_Hypermodels_for_science_education","245345132_STEAMER_An_interactive_inspectable_simulation-based_training_system","243783098_Exploring_Science_The_Cognition_and_Development_of_Discovery_Processes","243782229_Inquiry_in_Project-Based_Science_Classrooms_Initial_Attempts_by_Middle_School_Students","243766643_Computer-Based_Learning_Environments_and_Problem_Solving","243678441_Predicting_Learning_from_Student_Interaction_Defining_the_Interaction_Variables","243668632_Effective_Tutoring_Techniques_A_Comparison_of_Human_Tutors_and_Intelligent_Tutoring_Systems","243515260_Authentic_Inquiry_With_Data_Critical_Barriers_to_Classroom_Implementation","242463263_Model-it_a_design_retrospective","240526547_Reflective_discourse_Developing_shared_understandings_in_a_physics_classroom","239666574_A_Task_Analysis_Approach_to_the_Visualization_of_Geographic_Data","239049502_Young_People's_Images_of_Science","238740078_The_dynamics_of_composing_Making_plans_and_juggling_constraints","235584402_Inference_and_Discovery_in_an_Exploratory_Laboratory","233466500_Students'_Understanding_of_the_Objectives_and_Procedures_of_Experimentation_in_the_Science_Classroom","235034402_Problem_Solving_and_Cognitive_Skill_Acquisition","234637821_Supporting_Learning_at_Work_by_Making_Work_Activities_Visible_through_Information_Technology","233458151_Making_Dynamic_Modeling_Accessible_to_Precollege_Science_Students"]}
