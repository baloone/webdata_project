{"id":"277140773_VOTING_BASED_IMAGE_BINARIZATION","abstract":"In the literature there are a wide variety of algorithms for image binarization, the difference between them being the method that identifies the pixel threshold value. They can be split into two classes: algorithms that use a single threshold for the entire image (and tend to identify a few large objects) and algorithms that do the processing in localities (and tend to identify many small items). This paper aims at defining a method for image thresholding based on the results of several different algorithms. Knowing in advance the behavior of specific algorithms on different kinds of images, we can vote between their results. The end result of the proposed method is a mosaic of more binarization algorithms, hopefully better than any individual image.","authors":["Costin-Anton Boiangiu","Mihai Simion","Vlad Lionte","Mihai Zaharescu"],"meta":["December 2014"],"references":["264033997_Application_of_Image_Processing_to_Determine_Size_Distribution_of_Magnetic_Nanoparticles","263541883_Voting-Based_Layout_Analysis","260076060_Voting-Based_Image_Segmentation","235420417_Local_Thresholding_Image_Binarization_using_Variable-Window_Standard_Deviation_Response","235420027_Binarization_for_Digitization_Projects_Using_Hybrid_Foreground-Reconstruction","221253734_Efficient_implementation_of_local_adaptive_thresholding_techniques_using_integral_images","3710586_Adaptive_Document_Binarization","222646632_Pietikainen_M_Adaptive_Document_Image_Binarization_Pattern_Recognition_33_225-236"]}
