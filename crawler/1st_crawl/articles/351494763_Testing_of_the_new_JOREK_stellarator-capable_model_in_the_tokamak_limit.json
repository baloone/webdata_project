{"id":"351494763_Testing_of_the_new_JOREK_stellarator-capable_model_in_the_tokamak_limit","abstract":"In preparation for extending the JOREK nonlinear magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) code to stellarators, a hierarchy of stellarator-capable reduced and full MHD models has been derived and tested. The derivation was presented at the EFTC 2019 conference. Continuing this line of work, we have implemented the reduced MHD model (Nikulsin et al. , Phys. Plasmas , vol. 26, 2019, 102109) as well as an alternative model which was newly derived using a different set of projection operators for obtaining the scalar momentum equations from the full MHD vector momentum equation. With the new operators, the reduced model matches the standard JOREK reduced models for tokamaks in the tokamak limit and conserves energy exactly, while momentum conservation is less accurate than in the original model whenever field-aligned flow is present.","authors":["Nikita Nikulsin","Matthias Hoelzl","Alessandro Zocco","Karl Lackner"],"meta":["June 2021Journal of Plasma Physics 87(3)","DOI:10.1017/S0022377821000477"],"references":["351020447_The_JOREK_non-linear_extended_MHD_code_and_applications_to_large-scale_instabilities_and_their_control_in_magnetically_confined_fusion_plasmas","347594356_Magnetic_reconnection_in_3D_fusion_devices_non-linear_reduced_equations_and_linear_current-driven_instabilities","278829324_Energy_conservation_and_numerical_stability_for_the_reduced_MHD_models_of_the_non-linear_JOREK_code","264673560_Theoretical_and_numerical_stability_for_the_reduced_MHD_models_in_the_JOREK_code","258073776_Dynamics_of_high_b_tokamaks","253454483_Nonlinear_three-dimensional_magnetohydrodynamics_of_noncircular_tokamaks","344827455_Extended_full-MHD_simulation_of_non-linear_instabilities_in_tokamak_plasmas","336541082_A_three-dimensional_reduced_MHD_model_consistent_with_full_MHD","301227999_Implementation_of_the_full_viscoresistive_magnetohydrodynamic_equations_in_a_nonlinear_finite_element_code","253988238_Determination_of_Hydromagnetic_Equilibria"]}
