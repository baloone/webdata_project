{"id":"329417127_An_Evaluation_of_The_Mobile_Apps_for_Children_with_Special_Education_Needs_Based_on_The_Utility_Function_Metrics","abstract":"Mobile apps can be used in various environments and at any time. People can use them for learning, communications, entertainment. Because of the ease use of technologies, the smart mobile devices can be used by everyone, including the children with special needs. In recent years, there has been an increase in the efforts of educational institutions and of scientists to support children to socialize them and to aid in their daily life. Ongoing developments in communication and information technologies contribute to this process.\n\nThe main goal of this study is to present the basic functional requirements for mobile apps for children with special needs. The current state of the available research related to the design and development of mobile apps is discussed. This issue seems to become of vital importance because an increase in the number of children with disabilities on a worldwide scale is observed; the increase of the use of mobile technologies and the lack of appropriate software tailored to their individual capabilities are noted as well.\n\nThe proposed model for the evaluation of potential utility provides for the classification of the mobile applications designed for children with special needs in terms of their functionality features. The utility function metrics of the evaluation can be used as a basis for interface developing for mobile apps, appropriate for children with special needs.","authors":["Radoslava Stankova Kraleva","Velin Kralev"],"meta":["December 2018International Journal on Advanced Science Engineering and Information Technology 8(6)","DOI:10.18517/ijaseit.8.6.6309","Project: Design mobile applications for children"],"references":["321937481_ChilDiBu_-_A_Mobile_Application_for_Bulgarian_Children_with_Special_Educational_Needs","313233395_Mobile_Technology_for_Students_Adults_with_Autistic_Spectrum_Disorders_ASD","313108813_Designing_an_Interface_For_a_Mobile_Application_Based_on_Children's_Opinion","305951963_SDMF_Systematic_Decision-making_Framework_for_Evaluation_of_Software_Architecture","305663274_Fill_Me_App_An_Interactive_Mobile_Game_Application_for_Children_with_Autism","303755038_Analysis_of_applications_suitable_for_mobile_learning_of_preschool_children","310767566_Kockica_Developing_a_Serious_Game_for_Alphabet_Learning_and_Practising_Vocabulary","307889479_Acoustic-Prosodic_and_Turn-Taking_Features_in_Interactions_with_Children_with_Neurodevelopmental_Disorders","304294373_Smart_unified_interface_for_people_with_disabilities_at_the_work_place","297119939_STIMULUS_OVER-SELECTIVITY_IN_AUTISM_-_A_REVIEW_OF_RESEARCH"]}
