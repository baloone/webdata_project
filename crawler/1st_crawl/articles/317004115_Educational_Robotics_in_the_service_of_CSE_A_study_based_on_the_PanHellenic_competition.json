{"id":"317004115_Educational_Robotics_in_the_service_of_CSE_A_study_based_on_the_PanHellenic_competition","abstract":"The present work is an observational study recording the participating teachers' attitudes from the PanHellenic Educational Robotics (ER) competition. The study investigates the benefits of students' involvement with robotics about skills, motivation and learning. Additionally, it is researched weather ER should be introduced in the Greek compulsory curricula. A qualitative methodology was used and although the sample was relatively small (N=18), the results were quite homogeneous showing a very high level of engagement and motivation of teachers and students. The results show that there are numerous benefits for students: they seem to increase their collaboration, problem solving and creativity skills; understand STEM concepts about computer science and engineering and especially gaining programming knowledge. Moreover, most of the teachers consider that ER should be part of the compulsory curriculum.","authors":["Anastasios Theodoropoulos","Angeliki Antoniou","George Lepouras"],"meta":["October 2016","DOI:10.1145/2978249.2978262","Conference: Proceedings of the 11th Workshop in Primary and Secondary Computing Education"],"references":["305197309_Advancing_the_E_in_K-12_STEM_Education","271658384_Students_teach_students_Alternative_teaching_in_Greek_secondary_education","264043999_Educational_Robots_and_Computational_Thinking","233869622_Students_teachers_and_phenomena_Educational_reconstruction_for_computer_science_education","227036199_New_Pathways_into_Robotics_Strategies_for_Broadening_Participation","224892392_On_Generalization_in_Qualitatively_Oriented_Research","300918238_Just_Enough_Programming_for_Eight-years_Olds_Abstract_Only","300918152_Brainstorming_How_to_Use_Lego_Mindstorms_EV3_in_the_Classroom_Abstract_Only","267975217_More_than_Robots_An_Evaluation_of_the_FIRST_Robotics_Competition_Participant_and_Institutional_Impacts","266655083_Using_the_new_lego_MindStorms_EV3_robotics_platform_in_CS_courses_abstract_only","266653023_Engaging_undergraduate_programming_students_experiences_using_lego_mindstorms_NXT","262312612_Resources_and_Features_of_Robotics_Learning_Environments_RLEs_in_Spain_and_Latin_America","247424580_Robots_Exploring_new_technologies_for_learning_for_kids","221444353_Teaching_computer_science_with_robotics_using_AdaMindstorms_20","220996010_Using_the_NXT_as_an_educational_tool_in_computer_science_classes","2393019_Constructivism_in_Computer_Science_Education"]}
