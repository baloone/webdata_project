{"id":"330916641_Concepts_before_coding_non-programming_interactives_to_advance_learning_of_introductory_programming_concepts_in_middle_school","abstract":"Background and Context: Learners struggle with conceptual understanding of introductory programming concepts such as variables, expressions, and loops.\nObjective: We examine whether and how designed activities for conceptual exploration support preliminary engagement with and learning of foundational and often hard-to-grasp programming concepts for students in grades 6â€“8.\nMethod: Drawing on principles from dynamic mathematics, we developed a suite of non-programming digital and unplugged activities embedded in a curriculum before students engage in Scratch block-based programming. We conducted empirical research in three middle school classrooms in diverse urban US schools and examined student performance through mixed qualitative and quantitative methods.\nFindings: Learning gains were significant and not predicted by grade, gender or prior academic preparation. Free-choice projects of students showed statistically greater (correct) use of key concepts compared to those not in the study.\nImplications: Our work demonstrates the promise of novel approaches such as interactive non-programming activities for deeper understanding of programming concepts.","authors":["Shuchi Grover","Nicholas Jackiw","Patrik Lundh"],"meta":["February 2019Computer Science Education 29(3):1-30","DOI:10.1080/08993408.2019.1568955"],"references":["339510443_Designing_an_Assessment_for_Introductory_Programming_Concepts_in_Middle_School_Computer_Science","326539683_Concepts_Before_Coding_Instructional_Support_for_Introductory_Programming_Concepts_in_Middle_School_Computer_Science","323330826_What_We_Can_Learn_About_Student_Learning_From_Open-Ended_Programming_Projects_in_Middle_School_Computer_Science","319325770_A_Framework_for_Using_Hypothesis-Driven_Approaches_to_Support_Data-Driven_Learning_Analytics_in_Measuring_Computational_Thinking_in_Block-Based_Programming_Environments","314296105_Measuring_Student_Learning_in_Introductory_Block-Based_Programming_Examining_Misconceptions_of_Loops_Variables_and_Boolean_Logic","314293221_Using_Upper-Elementary_Student_Performance_to_Understand_Conceptual_Sequencing_in_a_Blocks-based_Curriculum","294878622_Factors_Influencing_Computer_Science_Learning_in_Middle_School","331302136_Non-Programming_Activities_for_Engagement_with_Foundational_Concepts_in_Introductory_Programming","317160209_Learnable_Programming_Blocks_and_Beyond","298972479_Learning_Computer_Science_Concepts_with_Scratch"]}
