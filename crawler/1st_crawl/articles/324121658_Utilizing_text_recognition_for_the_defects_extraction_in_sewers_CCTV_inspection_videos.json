{"id":"324121658_Utilizing_text_recognition_for_the_defects_extraction_in_sewers_CCTV_inspection_videos","abstract":"This paper proposed a novel automated framework for analyzing and tracking sewer inspection close-circuit television (CCTV) videos. The proposed model mainly supports the off-site examination and quality management process of the videos and enables efficient revaluation of CCTV videos to extract sewer condition data. The study discusses an important module for any automated analysis and defect detection in CCTV video. It includes two main modules: text recognition and cracks extraction. In the first module, multi-frame integration (MFI) was applied to reduce the background complexity, time and computational requirements needed for the video processing. Then maximally stable extremal regions (MSER) was used on the grayscale channel and HSV channel to effectively detect all the text edges. Saturation color channel was also applied to verify the detected text line and remove false alarms. In the second module, by utilizing the text information on each frame, the operator's operation during the inspection is simulated which would indicate valuable clues about the location and severity of the cracks. The proposed methodology was validated using a set of video provided by the Korea Institute of Construction Technology.","authors":["L.
