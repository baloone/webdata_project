{"id":"262490136_Computation_of_topological_indices_of_certain_networks","abstract":"There are certain types of topological indices such as degree based topological indices, distance based topological indices and counting related topological indices etc. Among degree based topological indices, the so-called atom-bond connectivity (ABC)(ABC), geometric–arithmetic (GA)(GA) are of vital importance. These topological indices correlate certain physico-chemical properties such as boiling point, stability and strain energy etc. of chemical compounds.\nIn this paper, we compute ABC4ABC4 and GA5GA5 indices for certain networks like silicate, chain silicate, hexagonal, oxide and honeycomb networks. The atom-bond connectivity index (ABC index) and geometric–arithmetic index (GA index) for oxide and chain silicate networks are also computed in this paper.","authors":["Sakander Hayat","Muhammad Imran"],"meta":["August 2014Applied Mathematics and Computation 240(23):213–228","DOI:10.1016/j.amc.2014.04.091"],"references":["285945141_Spectral_Properties_of_the_He_Matrix_of_Hexagonal_Systems","281511584_Computation_of_Certain_Topological_Indices_of_Nanotubes_Covered_by_C_5_and_C_7SUB","279311847_On_Degree_Based_Topological_Indices_of_Certain_Nanotubes","268020312_Ordering_Trees_Having_Small_General_Sum-Connectivity_Index","267390975_Computation_of_Certain_Topological_Indices_of_Nanotubes","285853391_Computing_ABC4_index_of_nanostar_dendrimers","285842416_Computing_fifth_geometric-arithmetic_index_for_nanostar_dendrimers","281993886_An_atom-bond_connectivity_index_Modelling_the_enthalpy_of_formation_of_alkanes","263779305_Chemical_Graph_Theory","258581481_Effects_of_Processing_Temperature_on_the_Mechanical_Properties_of_Calcium_Carbonate-Plastic_Composite_Packaging_Materials"]}
