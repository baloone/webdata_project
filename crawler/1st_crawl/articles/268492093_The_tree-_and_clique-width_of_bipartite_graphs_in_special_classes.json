{"id":"268492093_The_tree-_and_clique-width_of_bipartite_graphs_in_special_classes","abstract":"The tree- and clique-width are two graph parameters which are of primary importance in algorithmic graph theory because of the fact that many NP-hard graph problems admit polynomial-time solutions when restricted to graphs of bounded tree- or clique-width. Both parameters are known to be unbounded in the class of all bipartite graphs. We study the tree- and clique-width of bipartite graphs in special classes. The main result is a necessary condition for the tree- and clique-width to be bounded in subclasses of bipartite graphs defined by finitely many forbidden induced bipartite subgraphs. We use this result to analyze the tree- and clique-width of bipartite graphs in classes defined by a single forbidden induced subgraph.","authors":["Vadim Lozin","D.
