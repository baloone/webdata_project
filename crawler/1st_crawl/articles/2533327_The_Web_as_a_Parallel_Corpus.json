{"id":"2533327_The_Web_as_a_Parallel_Corpus","abstract":"Parallel corpora have become an essential resource for work in multilingual natural language processing. In this report, we describe our work using the STRAND system for mining parallel text on the World Wide Web, first reviewing the original algorithm and results and then presenting a set of significant enhancements. These enhancements include the use of supervised learning based on structural features of documents to improve classification performance, a new content-based measure of translational equivalence, and adaptation of the system to take advantage of the Internet Archive for mining parallel text from the Web on a large scale.","authors":["Ps Resnik","Noah A.
