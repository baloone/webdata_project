{"id":"284160169_Enhancing_the_Security_of_Caesar_Cipher_Substitution_Method_using_a_Randomized_Approach_for_more_Secure_Communication","abstract":"Caesar cipher is an ancient, elementary method of encrypting plain text\nmessage to protect it from adversaries. However, with the advent of powerful\ncomputers there is a need for increasing the complexity of such algorithms. In\nthis paper, we contribute in the area of classical cryptography by providing a\nmodified approach and expanded version for Caesar cipher using knowledge of\nmathematics and computer science. To increase the strength of this classical\nencryption technique we use the concepts of affine ciphers, transposition\nciphers and randomized substitution techniques to create a cipher text which is\nnearly impossible to decode. We also increase the domain of characters which\nCaesar cipher Algorithm can encrypt by including all ASCII and extended ASCII\ncharacters in addition to alphabets. A complex key generation technique which\ngenerates two keys from a single key is used to provide enhanced security. We\naim to propose a modified version of Caesar cipher substitution technique which\ncan overcome all the limitations faced by classical Caesar Cipher.","authors":["Atish Jain","Ronak Dedhia","Abhijit Patil"],"meta":["November 2015International Journal of Computer Applications 129(13):6-11","DOI:10.5120/ijca2015907062","Project: Enhancing the Security of Caesar Cipher Substitution Method using a Randomized Approach for more Secure Communication"],"references":["319135965_Developing_a_Modified_Hybrid_Caesar_Cipher_and_Vigenere_Cipher_for_Secure_Data_Communication","283042210_A_New_Modified_Caesar_Cipher_Cryptography_Method_with_LegibleCiphertext_From_a_Message_to_Be_Encrypted","269667378_Modified_Caesar_Cipher_for_Better_Security_Enhancement","269328375_A_modern_avatar_of_Julius_Ceasar_and_Vigenere_cipher"]}
