{"id":"336061532_A_Dynamical_Systems-Based_Hierarchy_for_Shannon_Metric_and_Topological_Entropy","abstract":"A rigorous dynamical systems-based hierarchy is established for the definitions of entropy of Shannon (information), Kolmogorovâ€“Sinai (metric) and Adler, Konheim & McAndrew (topological). In particular, metric entropy, with the imposition of some additional properties, is proven to be a special case of topological entropy and Shannon entropy is shown to be a particular form of metric entropy. This is the first of two papers aimed at establishing a dynamically grounded hierarchy comprising Clausius, Boltzmann, Gibbs, Shannon, metric and topological entropy in which each element is ideally a special case of its successor or some kind of limit thereof.","authors":["Raymond Addabbo","Denis Blackmore"],"meta":["September 2019Entropy 21(10):938","DOI:10.3390/e21100938"],"references":["331930592_Category_Theory_for_Autonomous_and_Networked_Dynamical_Systems","303351902_The_product_theorem_for_topological_entropy","298523647_Fifty_years_of_entropy_in_dynamics_1958-2007_-_Preface","284180912_The_Mathematical_Theory_of_Communication_University_of_Illinois_Press_Urbana","268243930_Fifty_years_of_entropy_in_dynamics_1958_-_2007","268071160_Pre-image_entropy_for_maps_on_noncompact_topological_spaces","267144424_Entropy_in_dynamical_systems","267121939_Grundbegriffe_der_Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung_Osnovnye_ponyatiya_teorii_veroyatnostej_2_Aufl","266843919_The_prevalence_of_uniquely_ergodic_systems","265374174_Entropy_per_unit_time_as_a_metric_invariant_of_automorphism"]}
