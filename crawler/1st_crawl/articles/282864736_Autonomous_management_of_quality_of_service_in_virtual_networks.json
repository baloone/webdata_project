A failure is treated locally, so other nodes in the network do not need to undertakespecial actions. In contrast to conventional IP routing schemes, each node routesthe traffic on the basis of the entering arc and of the destination. The resulting constraintis that two flows to the same destination entering in a node by a common archave to merge after this arc. We show that this is sufficient for dealing with all singlelink failure situations, assuming that the network is symmetric and two-link connected.We model the dimensioning problem with an Integer Linear Program which can besolved exactly for small networks. We also propose several heuristics for larger networks.Our method generalizes the methods of Xi et Chao and Li and of Nelakuditiet al. who have proposed similar schemes in the context of IP. Our methods are moreefficient than previous ones. We have also studied the existence of a resilient routingscheme for single node failure situation in switch-based network. We study also thecase of multi-link failure situations and show that requiring the network to be connectedafter any failure does not guarantee the existence of a resilent routing schemeas described above.","authors":["Thanh Son Pham"],"meta":["November 2014"],"references":["261337278_A_demonstration_of_automatic_bootstrapping_of_resilient_OpenFlow_networks","260357303_OpenFlow-Based_Segment_Protection_in_Ethernet_Networks","254003386_Virtual_routers_as_a_service_the_RouteFlow_approach_leveraging_software-defined_networks","238109224_FlowVisor_A_Network_Virtualization_Layer","225137130_Survivable_Virtual_Network_Embedding","221325413_Cabernet_Connectivity_architecture_for_better_network_services","221325360_DaVinci_dynamically_adaptive_virtual_networks_for_a_customized_Internet","221164581_Virtual_routers_on_the_move_Live_router_migration_as_a_network-management_primitive","3334642_Redundant_Trees_for_Preplanned_Recovery_in_Arbitrary_Vertex-Redundant_or_Edge-Redundant_Graphs","274441253_Autonomous_IP_Fast_Rerouting_with_Compressed_Backup_Flow_Entries_Using_OpenFlow","261203841_A_restoration_scheme_for_virtual_networks_using_switches","261158920_A_Fully_Distributed_Resilient_Routing_Scheme_for_Switch-Based_Networks","256942138_OpenFlow_Meeting_carrier-grade_recovery_requirements","242587064_Multiwavelength_Optical_Networks_a_Layered_Approach","234804921_Optimizing_Post-Failure_Network_Performance_for_IP_Fast_Reroute_using_Tunnels","228982167_IP_fast_reroute_with_failure_inferencing","224710828_IP_Backbone_Design_for_Multimedia_Distribution_Architecture_and_Performance","221602841_Enabling_fast_failure_recovery_in_OpenFlow_networks","221325405_Improving_internet-wide_routing_protocols_convergence_with_MRPC_timers","220676292_Network_virtualization_under_user_control","220545090_Virtual_networks_Isolation_performance_and_trends","220421398_Formal_Requirements_for_Virtualizable_Third_Generation_Architectures","4345013_IP_fast_rerouting_for_single-linknode_failure_recovery","3513310_Fault-tolerant_real-time_communication_in_distributed_computing_systems","3300259_Fault-tolerant_real-time_communication_in_distributed_computing_systems"]}
