{"id":"350482605_The_identification_of_varvecalpha_-clustered_doorway_states_in_444852Ti_using_machine_learning","abstract":"A novel experimental analysis method has been developed, making use of the continuous wavelet transform and machine learning to rapidly identify $$\\alpha $$ α -clustering in nuclei in regions of high nuclear state density. This technique was applied to resonant scattering measurements of the $$^\\text {4}$$ 4 He( $$^\\text {40,44,48}$$ 40,44,48 Ca, $$\\alpha $$ α ) resonant reactions, allowing the $$\\alpha $$ α -cluster structure of $$^\\text {44,48,52}$$ 44,48,52 Ti to be investigated. Fragmented $$\\alpha $$ α -clustering was identified in $$^\\text {44}$$ 44 Ti and $$^\\text {52}$$ 52 Ti, while the results for $$^\\text {48}$$ 48 Ti were less conclusive, but suggest no such clustering.","authors":["Sam Bailey","Tzany Kokalova","Martin Freer","Carl Wheldon"],"meta":["March 2021European Physical Journal A 57(3)","DOI:10.1140/epja/s10050-021-00357-3"],"references":["308609901_Transient_Classification_in_LIGO_data_using_Difference_Boosting_Neural_Networks","258223932_Alpha-clustering_and_molecular_structure_of_medium-weight_and_heavy_nuclei","337300331_Extracting_the_spectral_signature_of_a_clustering_in_Ti_44_48_52_using_a_continuous_wavelet_transform","285936692_Nuclear_reactions_for_astrophysics_Principles_calculation_and_applications_of_low-energy_reactions","279865147_REX_A_Monte_Carlo_simulation_of_thick_gas_target_resonant_scattering_reactions","277491314_Ne20_states_observed_via_O160O16_and_O161O16","260280172_Overview_of_random_forest_methodology_and_practical_guidance_with_emphasis_on_computational_biology_and_bioinformatics","258098079_R-Matrix_Theory_of_Nuclear_Reactions","255827281_alpha-cluster_structure_in_light_NneZ_nuclei","243478818_The_double-humped_fission_barrier"]}
