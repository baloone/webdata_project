{"id":"311478440_Creative_Virtual_Tree_Modeling_Through_Hierarchical_Topology-Preserving_Blending","abstract":"We present a new method to efficiently generate a set of morphologically diverse and inspiring virtual trees through hierarchical topology-preserving blending, aiming to facilitate designersâ€™ creativity production. By maintaining the topological consistency of the tree branches, sequences of similar yet different trees and novel intermediate trees with encouragingly interesting structures are generated by performing inner-species and cross-species blending, respectively. Hierarchical fuzzy correspondences are automatically established between two or multiple trees based on the multi-scale topology tree representations. Fundamental blending tasks including morph, grow and wilt are introduced and organized into a tree-structured blending scheduler, which not only introduces the randomness into the blending procedure but also wisely schedules the tasks to generate topology-aware blending sequences, contributing to a variety of resulting trees that exhibit diversities in both geometry and topology. Most significantly, multiple batches of blending can be executed in parallel, resulting in a rapid creation of a large repository of diverse trees.","authors":["Yutong Wang","Xiaowei Xue","Xiaogang Jin","Zhigang Deng"],"meta":["December 2016IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TVCG.2016.2636187","Project: Creative Tree Modeling"],"references":["266559683_Topology-Varying_3D_Shape_Creation_via_Structural_Blending","256663507_Probabilistic_Reasoning_for_Assembly-Based_3D_Modeling","256663198_Data-Driven_Suggestions_for_Creativity_Support_in_3D_Modeling","256663170_A_Probabilistic_Model_of_Component-Based_Shape_Synthesis","244477249_Morphological_shape_generation_through_user-controlled_group_metamorphosis","235765743_TreeSketch_Interactive_Procedural_Modeling_of_Trees_on_a_Tablet","221314843_Modeling_Trees_with_a_Space_Colonization_Algorithm","220818805_The_Sketch_L-System_Global_Control_of_Tree_Modeling_Using_Free-Form_Strokes","220506998_Interactive_Design_of_Bonsai_Tree_Models","220184106_Skeleton_Extraction_by_Mesh_Contraction","30012950_Sketch-Based_Tree_Modeling_Using_Markov_Random_Field","3208740_Interactive_Modeling_of_Plants","2888096_Topological_Evolution_of_Surfaces","2384407_Multi_Index_Assignment_Problems_Complexity_Approximation_Applications","314779251_A_probabilistic_model_for_component-based_shape_synthesis","312152791_Poisson_surface_reconstruction","297151563_Texture-lobes_for_tree_modelling","275673684_Interactive_tree_modeling_and_deformation_with_collision_detection_and_avoidance_Interactive_tree_modeling_and_deformation","271715618_High-quality_tree_structures_modelling_using_local_convolution_surface_approximation","270699725_Capturing_and_Animating_the_Morphogenesis_of_Polygonal_Tree_Models","268745732_Windy_Trees_Computing_Stress_Response_for_Developmental_Tree_Models","265426020_Algorithms_for_the_Assignment_and_Transportation_Problems","264669705_Smart_Variations_Functional_Substructures_for_Part_Compatibility","262208809_Exploring_Shape_Variations_by_3D-Model_Decomposition_and_Part-based_Recombination","261673920_Creature_Grammar_for_Creative_Modeling_of_3D_Monsters","261030585_Inverse_Procedural_Modelling_of_Trees","254461103_Fit_and_Diverse_Set_Evolution_for_Inspiring_3D_Shape_Galleries","239059434_The_Hungarian_Method_for_the_Assignment_Problem","236344183_The_Hungarian_Method_for_the_Assignment_Problem","227720087_Structure_from_silhouettes_A_new_paradigm_for_fast_sketch-based_design_of_trees","222543099_Continuous_field_based_free-form_surface_modeling_and_morphing","221402392_Natural_Eye_Motion_Synthesis_by_Modeling_Gaze-Head_Coupling","221316529_Screened_Poisson_Surface_Reconstruction","220720562_Scheduled_Fourier_volume_morphing","220720517_Creation_and_Rendering_of_Realistic_Trees","220556555_Skeleton-based_three-dimensional_geometric_morphing","220507319_Strands_Gravity_and_Botanical_Tree_Imagery","220224183_A_Constrained_Edit_Distance_Between_Unordered_Labeled_Trees","220184395_Knowledge_and_heuristic-based_modeling_of_laser-scanned_trees","220184289_Data-Driven_Suggestions_for_Creativity_Support_in_3D_Modeling","220068323_Synthesizing_trees_by_plantons","38050887_A_relationship_between_circumference_and_weight_in_trees_and_its_bearing_on_branching_angles","30012503_Realistic_Real-Time_Rendering_of_Landscapes_Using_Billboard_Clouds","13689818_A_Multiscale_Model_of_Plant_Topological_Structures","4295585_Model_Composition_from_Interchangeable_Components","3922449_Multiresolution_Interpolation_Meshes","2927166_Shape_Transformation_Using_Variational_Implicit_Functions","2811157_Three-Dimensional_Distance_Field_Metamorphosis","2538876_As-Rigid-As-Possible_Shape_Interpolation","2399906_Blending_Polygonal_Shapes_with_Different_Topologies"]}
