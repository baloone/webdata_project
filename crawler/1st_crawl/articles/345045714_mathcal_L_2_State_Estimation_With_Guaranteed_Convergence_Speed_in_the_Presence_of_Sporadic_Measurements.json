An observer with a continuous intersample injection term is proposed. Such an intersample injection is provided by a linear dynamical system, whose state is reset to the measured output estimation error whenever a new measurement is available. The resulting system is augmented with a timer triggering the arrival of a new measurement and analyzed in a hybrid system framework. The design of the observer is performed to achieve exponential convergence with a given decay rate of the estimation error. Robustness with respect to external perturbations and L\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n-external stability from plant perturbations to a given performance output are considered. Computationally efficient algorithms based on the solution to linear matrix inequalities are proposed to design the observer. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed methodology is shown in an example.","authors":["Francesco Ferrante","Frédéric Gouaisbaut","Ricardo G.
