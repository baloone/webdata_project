{"id":"234815083_The_Weak_Byzantine_Generals_Problem","abstract":"The Byzantine Generals Problem requires processes to reach agreement upon a value open though some of them may fail. It is weakened by allowing them to agree upon an 'incorrect' value if a failure occurs. The transaction commit problem for a distributed database is a special case of the weaker problem. It is shown that, like the original Byzantine Generals Problem, the weak version can be solved only if fewer than one-third of the processes may fail. Unlike the original problem, an approximate solution exists that can tolerate arbitrarily many failures.","authors":["Leslie Lamport"],"meta":["July 1983Journal of the ACM 30(3):668-676","DOI:10.1145/2402.322398","Sourcedoi.acm.org"],"references":["242545975_Notes_on_database_operating_systems_operating_systems_an_advanced_course","234831006_Reaching_Agreement_in_the_Presence_of_Faults","221621885_Notes_on_Data_Base_Operating_Systems"]}
