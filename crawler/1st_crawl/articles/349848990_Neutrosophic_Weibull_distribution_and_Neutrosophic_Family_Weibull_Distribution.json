In this paper, we will focus on studying\nneutrosophic Weibull distribution and its family, through explaining its special cases , and the\nfunctions' relationship with neutrosophic Weibull such as Neutrosophic Inverse Weibull,\nNeutrosophic Rayleigh, Neutrosophic three parameter Weibull, Neutrosophic Beta Weibull,\nNeutrosophic five Weibull, Neutrosophic six Weibull distributions (various parameters).This study\nwill enable us to deal with indeterminate or inaccurate problems in a flexible manner. These\nproblems will follow this family of distributions. In addition, these distributions are applied in\nvarious domains, such as reliability, electrical engineering, Quality Control ….. etc. Some properties\nand examples for these distributions are discussed.","authors":["Kawther Fawzi","Hamza Alhasan","Florentin Smarandache","Kawther Hamza"],"meta":["November 2019","DOI:10.5281/zenodo.3382540"],"references":["338717366_A_Hybrid_Plithogenic_Decision-Making_Approach_with_Quality_Function_Deployment_for_Selecting_Supply_Chain_Sustainability_Metrics","330291834_A_Group_Decision_Making_Framework_Based_on_Neutrosophic_TOPSIS_Approach_for_Smart_Medical_Device_Selection","328842052_Neutrosophic_Decision_Making_Neutrosophic_Decision_Tree_Arabic_Version","325935235_Three-way_decisions_based_on_neutrosophic_sets_and_AHP-QFD_framework_for_supplier_selection","343949844_Integrated_neutrosophic_ANP_and_VIKOR_method_for_achieving_sustainable_supplier_selection_A_case_study_in_importing_field","343949664_An_approach_of_TOPSIS_technique_for_developing_supplier_selection_with_group_decision_making_under_type-2_neutrosophic_number","334091575_Utilising_neutrosophic_theory_to_solve_transition_difficulties_of_IoT-based_enterprises","333537649_Evaluation_of_the_green_supply_chain_management_practices_A_novel_neutrosophic_approach","332161506_Neutrosophic_Multi-Criteria_Decision_Making_Approach_for_IoT-Based_Enterprises","329450898_On_Recent_Modifications_of_Extended_Weibull_Families_Distributions_and_Its_Applications"]}
