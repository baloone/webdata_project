{"id":"325345180_Higher_education_dominance_and_siloed_knowledge_a_systematic_review_of_flipped_classroom_research","abstract":"This structured review examined (academic) publications on flipped or inverted\nclassrooms based on all Scopus database (n = 530) references available until mid-June\n2016. The flipped or inverted classroom approach has gained widespread attention\nduring the latest decade and is based on the idea of improving student learning by\nprepared self-studies via technology-based resources (‘flips’) followed by high-quality,\nin-class teaching and learning activities. However, only a few attempts have been made\nto review the knowledge of the field of interest more systematically. This article seeks\nto address this problem and investigates what constitutes the research on flipped\nclassrooms and, in particular, to examine the knowledge contributions with the field so\nfar in relation to the wider research topic of educational technology. This review found\nthat the current state of flipped classrooms as a field of interest is growing fast, with a\nslight conference preference and a focus on higher education and STEM (science,\ntechnology, engineering and math) area contributions, with the US as the predominant\ngeographical context. It is concluded that studies on flipped classrooms are dominated\nby studies in higher education sector and are relatively local in character. The research\ntends not to interact beyond the two clusters of general education/educational\ntechnology and subject-specific areas. This implies that knowledge contributions\nrelated to the flipped classroom approach are relatively siloed and fragmented\nand have yet to stabilise. Academically and socially, the research is quite scattered, and\nonly local evidence and experiences are available. The knowledge contributions within\nthis field of interest seem to be anecdotal rather than systematically researched. To a\nlarge extent, the research lacks anchoring in, for example, learning theory or\ninstructional design known from educational technology traditions and which\nwould have helped much of the flipped classroom research to examine aspects\nof the flipped classroom approach more fully.","authors":["Mona Lundin","Annika Bergviken-Rensfeldt","Thomas Hillman","Annika Lantz-Andersson"],"meta":["December 2018","DOI:10.1186/s41239-018-0101-6","Project: Flipped education movement (FEM)"],"references":["322831826_Flipped_Classroom_Research_From_Black_Box_to_White_Box_Evaluation","305494885_The_flipped_classroom_for_active_effective_and_increased_learning_-_especially_for_low_achievers","303710507_The_flipped_classroom_model_at_the_university_analysis_based_on_professors'_and_students'_assessment_in_the_educational_field","297225786_What_Twitter_will_and_will_not_do_Theorizing_about_teachers'_online_professional_communities","337191438_What_Twitter_Will_and_Will_Not_Do_Theorizing_About_Teachers'_Online_Professional_Communities","324639686_The_Intellectual_and_Social_Organization_of_the_Sciences","304071148_Learned_risks_and_experienced_rewards_Exploring_the_potential_sources_of_students'_attitudes_toward_social_media_and_face-to-face_communication","287104845_The_Flipped_Classroom_Online_instruction_at_home_frees_class_time_for_learning","286993943_Evidence_on_flipped_classrooms_is_still_coming_in","285483645_Using_lean_in_the_flipped_classroom_for_at_risk_students","265051052_Motivation_and_cognitive_load_in_the_flipped_classroom_definition_rationale_and_a_call_for_research","284084931_Clustering_blended_learning_courses_by_online_behavior_data_case_study_in_a_Korean_higher_education_institute","274434507_The_Flipped_Class_A_Method_to_Address_the_Challenges_of_an_Undergraduate_Statistics_Course","272753099_The_use_of_flipped_classrooms_in_higher_education_A_scoping_review","264864104_Working_in_separate_silos_What_citation_patterns_reveal_about_higher_education_research_internationally"]}
