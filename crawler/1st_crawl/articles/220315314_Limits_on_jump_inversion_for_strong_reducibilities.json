{"id":"220315314_Limits_on_jump_inversion_for_strong_reducibilities","abstract":"We show that Sacks' and Shoenfield's analogs of jump inversion fail\nfor both tt- and wtt-reducibilities in a strong way.\nIn particular we show that there is a Δ02 set B >tt ∅'\nsuch that there is no c.e. set A with A' ≡wtt B.\nWe also show that there is a Σ02 set C\n>tt ∅' such\nthat there is no Δ02 set D with D' ≡wtt C.","authors":["Barbara F.
