{"id":"269308738_ArabChat_An_Arabic_Conversational_Agent","abstract":"This paper details the development of a novel and practical Conversational Agent for the Arabic language called ArabChat. A conversational Agent is a computer program that attempts to simulate conversations between machine and human. In this paper, the term 'conversation' or 'utterance' refers to real-time chat exchange between machine and human. The proposed framework for developing the Arabic Conversational Agent (ArabChat) is based on Pattern Matching approach to handle users' conversations. The Pattern Matching approach is based on the matching process between a user's utterance and pre-scripted patterns that represents different topics organized through novel scripting structure. A real experiment has been done in Applied Science University in Jordan as an information point advisor for their native Arabic students to evaluate the ArabChat.","authors":["Mohammad Hijjawi","Zuhair Bandar","Keeley Crockett","David Mclean"],"meta":["March 2014International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications 7(2):227-237","DOI:10.1109/CSIT.2014.6806005","Conference: 2014 6th International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology (CSIT)","Project: ArabChat"],"references":["289256667_The_internet_in_the_Arab_World_Playground_for_political_liberalization","242392559_Natural_Language_in_Dialogue_Systems_A_Case_Study_on_a_Medical_Application","228636500_Building_a_wordnet_for_arabic","228623160_Introducing_the_Arabic_wordnet_project","318494451_Computing_Machinery_and_Intelligence","317646849_Dictionary_of_Linguistics_and_Phonetics","299748594_Conversational_Agents","292444823_The_Adoption_of_the_Internet_to_Support_Arab_Academics","261241996_User's_utterance_classification_using_machine_learning_for_Arabic_Conversational_Agents","246049244_ELIZA_a_computer_program_for_the_study_of_natural_language_communication_between_men_and_machines"]}
