{"id":"325289267_Effect_of_leading_waves_on_velocity_distribution_of_undular_bore_traveling_over_sloping_bottom","abstract":"For providing new insights into the effect of the leading waves on the velocity distribution of the generated bore, a case study of the undular bore (or weak bore) with the water depth ratio 1.70 is tested in a flume, using flow visualization technique (FVT) and high-speed particle image velocimetry (HSPIV). The undular bore, generated right downstream of a suddenly lifted gate, propagates first over a horizontal bottom and then travels over a 1:20 sloping bottom. The wave gauges were used to measure the free surface elevations of the generated bore at different positions. A complete evolution of the free surface elevations of the generated bore accompanied by the dispersive leading waves, measured at different shoreward positions, is elucidated first. Illustrations of variations in wave period and height of each leading wave in the onshore direction are also made. Based on visualized images and velocity fields measured, the following flow features at different stages of the generated bores are explored: (1) The temporal and spatial variations in the flow field of the generated bore with respect to passing of the leading waves; (2) The influence of the leading waves on shifting of the velocity distribution of the generated bore, along with illustrations of flow acceleration or deceleration in the onshore direction; (3) Flow reversal zone and shear layer formation near the sloping bottom; (4) Development of a vortex train (or street) in the shear layer between two opposite currents consisting of the onshore run-up flow and the offshore flow reversal right over the sloping bottom.","authors":["Chang Lin","Ming-Jer Kao","Wei-Ying Wong","Yi-Po Shao"],"meta":["May 2018European Journal of Mechanics - B/Fluids 73","DOI:10.1016/j.euromechflu.2018.05.005"],"references":["309654027_Spilling_breakers_in_shallow_water_Applications_to_Favre_waves_and_to_the_shoaling_and_breaking_of_solitary_waves","285867587_Experimental_study_of_tail_water_level_effects_on_dam-break_flood_wave_propagation","248798712_Turbulence_transport_vorticity_dynamics_and_solute_mixing_under_plunging_breaking_waves_in_surf_zone","233213054_Undular_bores_and_secondary_waves_-_Experiments_and_hybrid_finite-volume_modeling","231823529_A_numerical_study_of_breaking_waves_in_surf_zone","229294812_Experimental_study_of_bore-driven_swash_hydrodynamics_on_permeable_rough_slopes","228675718_Nearshore_Dynamics_of_Tsunami-like_Undular_Bores_using_a_Fully_Nonlinear_Boussinesq_Model","340379679_Flow_in_Open_Channels","301823426_Advances_in_numerical_modelling_of_swash_zone_dynamics","299375254_Velocity_Characteristics_in_Boundary_Layer_Flow_Caused_by_Solitary_Wave_Traveling_over_Horizontal_Bottom","284280176_Study_on_Flow_Fields_of_Boundary-Layer_Separation_and_Hydraulic_Jump_during_Rundown_Motion_of_Shoaling_Solitary_Wave","260994555_Flow_convergence_at_the_tip_and_edges_of_a_viscous_swash_front_-_Experimental_and_analytical_modeling","260341132_Prebreaking_internal_velocity_field_induced_by_a_solitary_wave_propagating_over_a_110_slope","256969038_The_initial_stage_of_dam-break_flow_of_two_immiscible_fluids_Linear_analysis_of_global_flow","251584995_Wave_Breaking_in_Boussinesq_Models_for_Undular_Bores","248792067_On_bore_collapse","248784896_Experimental_Determination_of_Run-Up_of_Undular_and_Fully_Developed_Bores","245328319_Undular_bores_Favre_Waves_in_open_channels-experimental_studies","240154503_On_the_Theory_of_Oscillatory_Waves","239374802_Laboratory_and_numerical_study_of_dambreak-generated_swash_on_impermeable_slopes","231958712_Climb_of_a_bore_on_a_beach_Part_2_Non-uniform_beach_slope","231954622_Climb_of_a_bore_on_a_beach_Part_3_Run-up","231945497_Climb_of_a_bore_on_a_beach_Part_1_Uniform_beach_slope","231917297_Calculations_of_the_development_of_an_undular_bore","231900210_Surf_and_run-up_on_a_beach_a_uniform_bore","231892397_Turbulent_bores_and_hydraulic_jumps","231870589_Experimental_study_of_bore_run-up","231866121_The_initial_stages_of_dam-break_flow","226712568_External_and_internal_flow_fields_of_plunging_breakers","223610519_A_numerical_study_of_swash_flows_generated_by_bores","223480465_Observation_and_measurement_of_the_bottom_boundary_layer_flow_in_the_prebreaking_zone_of_shoaling_waves","222944480_Direct_bed_shear_stress_measurements_in_bore-driven_swash","222708247_The_influence_of_seaward_boundary_conditions_on_swash_zone_hydrodynamics"]}
