{"id":"324584282_Asymptotic_behavior_of_large_Gaussian_correlated_Wishart_matrices","abstract":"We consider high-dimensional Wishart matrices $d^{-1}\\mathcal{X}_{n,d}\\mathcal{X}_{n,d}^T$, associated with a rectangular random matrix $\\mathcal{X}_{n,d}$ of size $n\\times d$ whose entries are jointly Gaussian and correlated. Even if we will consider the case of overall correlation among the entries of $\\mathcal{X}_{n,d}$, our main focus is on the case where the rows of $\\mathcal{X}_{n,d}$ are independent copies of a $n$-dimensional stationary centered Gaussian vector of correlation function $s$. When $s$ belongs to $\\ell^{4/3}(\\mathbb{Z})$, we show that a proper normalization of $d^{-1}\\mathcal{X}_{n,d}\\mathcal{X}_{n,d}^T$ is close in Wasserstein distance to the corresponding Gaussian ensemble as long as $d$ is much larger than $n^3$, thus recovering the main finding of [3,9] and extending it to a larger class of matrices. We also investigate the case where $s$ is the correlation function associated with the fractional Brownian noise of parameter $H$. This example is very rich, as it gives rise to a great variety of phenomena with very different natures, depending on how $H$ is located with respect to $1/2$, $5/8$ and $3/4$. Notably, when $H>3/4$, our study highlights a new probabilistic object, which we have decided to call the Rosenblatt-Wishart matrix. Our approach crucially relies on the fact that the entries of the Wishart matrices we are dealing with are double Wiener-It\\^o integrals, allowing us to make use of multivariate bounds arising from the Malliavin-Stein method and related ideas. To conclude the paper, we analyze the situation where the row-independence assumption is relaxed and we also look at the setting of random $p$-tensors ($p\\geq 3$), a natural extension of Wishart matrices.","authors":["Ivan Nourdin","Guangqu Zheng"],"meta":["April 2018"],"references":["310462830_A_smooth_transition_from_Wishart_to_GOE","266319567_A_Random_Matrix_Approximation_for_the_Non-commutative_Fractional_Brownian_Motion","256606278_Approximation_of_Rectangular_Beta-Laguerre_Ensembles_and_Large_Deviations","239516928_Distribution_of_eigen_values_in_certain_sets_of_random_matrices","2211385_Concentration_of_the_spectral_measure_of_large_Wishart_matrices_with_dependent_entries","2134865_Multivariate_normal_approximation_using_exchangeable_pairs","315835548_Exchangeable_pairs_on_Wiener_chaos","306218283_A_tensor_approach_to_learning_mixed_membership_community_models","281670263_Entropic_CLT_and_phase_transition_in_high-dimensional_Wishart_matrices","270309307_Real_Analysis_and_Probability","268689600_Testing_for_high-dimensional_geometry_in_random_graphs","251232554_Properties_and_numerical_evaluation_of_the_Rosenblatt_distribution","225709948_Stein's_method_on_Wiener_chaos","225685639_Fluctuations_of_eigenvalues_and_second_order_Poincar_inequalities","51955615_Central_and_Non-central_Limit_Theorems_in_a_Free_Probability_Setting","31403966_The_Generalised_Product_Moment_Distribution_in_Samples_from_a_Normal_Multivariate_Population","2118722_Central_limit_theorems_for_sequences_of_multiple_stochastic_integrals","1919605_Error_bounds_on_the_non-normal_approximation_of_Hermite_power_variations_of_fractional_Brownian_motion","1919003_Multivariate_normal_approximation_using_Stein's_method_and_Malliavin_calculus"]}
