{"id":"243066731_The_contraction_principle_for_mappings_on_a_metric_with_a_graph","abstract":"We give some generalizations of the Banach Contraction Principle to mappings on a metric space endowed with a graph. This extends and subsumes many recent results of other authors which were obtained for mappings on a partially ordered metric space. As an application, we present a theorem on the convergence of successive approximations for some linear operators on a Banach space. In particular, the last result easily yields the Kelisky-Rivlin theorem on iterates of the Bernstein operators on the space C[0,1].","authors":["Jacek Jachymski"],"meta":["April 2007Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society 136(04):1359-1373","DOI:10.1090/S0002-9939-07-09110-1"],"references":["279889462_A_fixed_point_theorem_in_partially_ordered_sets_and_some_application_to_matrix_equations","258382125_Coupled_Fixed-Point_Theorems_for_Contractions_in_Partially_Ordered_Metric_Spaces_and_Applications","243066471_Fixed_point_theorems_in_ordered_L-spaces","238870600_Fixed_Point_Theorems_in_Ordered_Abstract_Spaces","228707614_A_fixed_point_theorem_in_partially_ordered_sets_and_some_applications_to_matrix_equations","225912274_Existence_and_Uniqueness_of_Fixed_Point_in_Partially_Ordered_Sets_and_Applications_to_Ordinary_Differential_Equations","222263669_Fixed_point_theorems_in_partially_ordered_Metric_spaces_and_applications","220533865_Contractive_Mapping_Theorems_in_Partially_Ordered_Sets_and_Applications_to_Ordinary_Differential_Equations","288941372_Order-theoretic_aspects_of_metric_fixed_point_theory","268027130_An_Extension_of_Banach's_Contraction_Principle","267008482_Linear_Operators_I_General_Theory","247080267_Handbook_of_Metric_Fixed_Point_Theory","243013195_Iterates_of_Bernstein_operators_via_contraction_principle","38346583_Iterates_of_Bernstein_polynomials"]}
