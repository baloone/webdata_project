{"id":"222489987_Forecasting_With_Artificial_Neural_Networks_The_State_of_the_Art","abstract":"Interest in using artificial neural networks (ANNs) for forecasting has led to a tremendous surge in research activities in the past decade. While ANNs provide a great deal of promise, they also embody much uncertainty. Researchers to date are still not certain about the effect of key factors on forecasting performance of ANNs. This paper presents a state-of-the-art survey of ANN applications in forecasting. Our purpose is to provide (1) a synthesis of published research in this area, (2) insights on ANN modeling issues, and (3) the future research directions.","authors":["Peter G.
