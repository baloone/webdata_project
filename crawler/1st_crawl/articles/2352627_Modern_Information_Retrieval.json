{"id":"2352627_Modern_Information_Retrieval","abstract":"Information retrieval (IR) has changed considerably in the last years with the expansion of the Web (World Wide Web) and the advent of modern and inexpensive graphical user interfaces and mass storage devices. As a result, traditional IR textbooks have become quite out-of-date which has led to the introduction of new IR books recently. Nevertheless, we believe that there is still great need of a book that approaches the field in a rigorous and complete way from a computer-science perspective (in opposition to a user-centered perspective). This book is an effort to partially fulfill this gap and should be useful for a first course on information retrieval as well as for a graduate course on the topic.","authors":["Ricardo Baeza-Yates","Berthier Ribeiro-neto","Don Mills","Ontario Amsterdam Bonn"],"meta":["July 1999"],"references":[]}
