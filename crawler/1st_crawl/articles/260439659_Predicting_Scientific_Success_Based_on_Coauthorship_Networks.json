{"id":"260439659_Predicting_Scientific_Success_Based_on_Coauthorship_Networks","abstract":"We address the question to what extent the success of scientific articles is\ndue to social influence. Analyzing a data set of over 100000 publications from\nthe field of Computer Science, we study how centrality in the coauthorship\nnetwork differs between authors who have highly cited papers and those who do\nnot. We further show that a machine learning classifier, based only on\ncoauthorship network centrality measures at time of publication, is able to\npredict with high precision whether an article will be highly cited five years\nafter publication. By this we provide quantitative insight into the social\ndimension of scientific publishing - challenging the perception of citations as\nan objective, socially unbiased measure of scientific success.","authors":["Emre Sarig√∂l","Rene Pfitzner","Ingo Scholtes","Antonios Garas"],"meta":["February 2014EPJ Data Science","DOI:10.1140/epjds/s13688-014-0009-x","SourcearXiv"],"references":["235251464_What_do_citation_counts_measure_A_review_of_studies_on_citing_behavior_J_Doc_64145-80_DOI_10110800220410810844150","233385672_In_science_there_is_no_bad_publicity_Papers_criticized_in_comments_have_high_scientific_impact","230841691_Future_impact_Predicting_scientific_success","288906520_Random_forests","280566512_Networks_An_Introduction","272102209_Citation_Indexes_for_Science_A_New_Dimension_in_Documentation_through_Association_of_Ideas","258304769_Machine_Learning_Volume_45_Number_1_-_SpringerLink","258144941_Prediction_of_highly_cited_papers","257663393_Analysis_of_bibliometric_indicators_for_individual_scholars_in_a_large_data_set","248866214_Bibliometric_evaluation_of_individual_researchers_Not_even_right_not_even_wrong"]}
