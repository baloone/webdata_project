{"id":"276941928_An_Approach_to_Corpus-based_Discourse_Analysis_The_Move_Analysis_as_Example","abstract":"This article presents a seven-step corpus-based approach to discourse analysis that starts with a detailed analysis of each individual text in a corpus that can then be generalized across all texts of a corpus, providing a description of typical patterns of discourse organization that hold for the entire corpus. This approach is applied specifically to a methodology that is used to analyze texts in terms of the functional/communicative structures that typically make up texts in a genre: move analysis. The resulting corpus-based approach for conducting a move analysis significantly enhances the value of this often used (and misused) methodology, while at the same time providing badly needed guidelines for a methodology that lacks them. A corpus of 'birthmother letters' is used to illustrate the approach.","authors":["Thomas A Upton","Mary Ann Cohen"],"meta":["October 2009Discourse Studies 11(5):585-605","DOI:10.1177/1461445609341006"],"references":["354797337_Using_Corpora_in_Discourse_Analysis","344719748_Aspects_of_Article_Introductions_Michigan_Classics_Ed","344649113_Contrastive_Rhetoric_Cross-Cultural_Aspects_of_Second_Language_Writing","344472696_Corpus_Linguistics_Investigating_Language_Structure_and_Use","328368364_Discourse_on_the_Move_Using_Corpus_Analysis_to_Describe_Discourse_Structure","306940127_The_genre_of_grant_proposals_a_corpus_linguistic_analysis","300837217_The_genre_of_grant_proposals_A_corpus_linguistic_analysis","292252889_The_Handbook_of_Discourse_Analysis","290329620_Using_corpora_in_discourse_analysis","270304489_Contrastive_Rhetoric_Cross-Cultural_Aspects_of_Second-Language_Writing"]}
