{"id":"329632400_The_Significance_of_Statistical_Significance_Tests_in_Marketing_Research","abstract":"Classical statistical significance testing is the primary method by which marketing researchers empirically test hypotheses and draw inferences about theories. The authors discuss the interpretation and value of classical statistical significance tests and suggest that classical inferential statistics may be misinterpreted and overvalued by marketing researchers in judging research results. Replication, Bayesian hypothesis testing, meta-analysis, and strong inference are examined as approaches for augmenting conventional statistical analyses.","authors":["Alan G. Sawyer","J.
