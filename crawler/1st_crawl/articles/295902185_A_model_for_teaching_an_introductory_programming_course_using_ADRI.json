{"id":"295902185_A_model_for_teaching_an_introductory_programming_course_using_ADRI","abstract":"High failure and drop-out rates from introductory programming courses continue to be of significant concern to computer science disciplines despite extensive research attempting to address the issue. In this study, we include the three entities of the didactic triangle, instructors, students and curriculum, to explore the learning difficulties that students encounter when studying introductory programming. We first explore students’ perceptions of the barriers and affordances to learning programming. A survey is conducted with introductory programming students to get their feedback on the topics and associated learning resources in the introductory programming course. The instructors’ perceptions are included by analyzing current teaching materials and assessment tools used in the course. As a result, an ADRI based approach is proposed to address the problems identified in the teaching and learning processes of an introductory programming course.","authors":["Sohail Iqbal Malik","Jo Coldwell-Neilson"],"meta":["May 2017Education and Information Technologies 22(3)","DOI:10.1007/s10639-016-9474-0"],"references":["303809631_Bloom's_taxonomy_for_CS_assessment","272910901_A_Self_Review_and_External_Review_Model_for_Teaching_and_Assessing_Novice_Programmers","321606572_Learning_Strategies_and_Learning_Styles","314816021_Formative_evaluation_scheme_for_a_web-based_course_design","313445271_Developing_collaborative_skills_early_in_the_CS_curriculum_in_a_laboratory_environment","300484111_Supporting_Diverse_Novice_Programming_Cohorts_through_Flexible_and_Incremental_Visual_Constructivist_Pathways","300454464_Strategies_and_Styles_of_Learning","290731875_The_Reform_of_Programming_Teaching_Based_on_Constructivism","268446418_Merriam-Webster's_Collegiate_Dictionary_Merriam-Webster_Online","267705862_An_Overview_of_Computer_Programming_Teaching_Methods"]}
