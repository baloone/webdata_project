{"id":"316542679_Roughness_in_non-associative_po-semihypergroups_based_on_pseudohyperorder_relations","abstract":"In this paper, we consider an ordered LA-semihypergroup and discuss its roughness. In particular, we study some properties of rough hyperideals, rough bi-hyperideals and rough quasi-hyperideals in ordered LA-semihypergroups using the pseudohyperorder relations. Finally, we investigate the idea of direct product of sub LA-semihypergroups and prove some results in this regard.","authors":["Jianming Zhan","N.
