{"id":"355025731_A_bibliometrics_study_of_library_and_information_science_doctoral_dissertations_in_China_from_2011_to_2020","abstract":"By reading the titles, abstracts, and keywords of LIS doctoral dissertations in China from 2011â€“2020 and conducting cluster analysis and network analysis of keywords, this study aims to understand the intelligence structure of LIS doctoral dissertations in China, as well as the disciplines and topics intersecting with LIS. The results indicated that Wuhan University had the highest number of doctoral dissertations among all the selected universities offering LIS doctoral education. Research fields mainly focus on online information behavior and information services. The findings could be because of the development of computer science and information technology in the past decade, which indicates that the research direction of LIS in China follows the trend of time development.","authors":["Ting Wang","Brady D.
