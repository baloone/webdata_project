{"id":"320243860_The_MAVA_corpus","abstract":"The MAVA corpus (MARCS Auditory-Visual Australian recordings of IEEE sentences) is a collection of high quality audiovisual recordings of 205 phonetically balanced sentences from the IEEE sentence database, recorded by a native Australian English female talker. The audio channel is annotated at the word and phoneme level. In addition, for the video channel, frame-by-frame lip contour X Y coordinates are provided. The center of the lip region is used as a reference for deriving four video regions: full face, upper face, lower face and lips.
