HFE-7100, a dielectric and eco-friendly coolant, was chosen as the working fluid. Twenty five rectangular microchannels, of width 0.7 mm and height 0.35 mm giving a hydraulic diameter of 0.46 mm, were fabricated from oxygen-free copper with a base area of 500 mm2. The channels in-between wall was 0.1 mm thick. Five mass fluxes ranging from 50 to 250 kg/m2s were tested at fixed inlet sub-cooling near 5 K. The effect of heat flux, mass flux and vapour quality on the local heat transfer coefficient was investigated. Four flow patterns namely; bubbly, slug, churn and annular flow, were visualized using a high-speed camera mounted on a microscope. In this study, maximum flow boiling heat transfer coefficient was 12.71 kW/m2K at mass flux of 250 kg/m2s. A comprehensive comparison with experimental results was conducted including flow pattern maps, heat transfer and pressure drop correlations. Some of the correlations, proposed for conventional channels and microchannels, showed good agreement with the present results.","authors":["Ali Hameed Al-Zaidi","Mohamed M Mahmoud","Tassos Karayiannis"],"meta":["September 2019International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer 140:100-128","DOI:10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2019.05.095","Project: Micro-cooling System for Electronics."],"references":["330154161_FLOW_BOILING_IN_MICRO-PASSAGES_DEVELOPMENTS_IN_FUNDAMENTAL_ASPECTS_AND_APPLICATIONS","319617637_Condensation_Flow_Patterns_and_Heat_Transfer_in_Horizontal_Microchannels","316667494_FLOW_BOILING_HEAT_TRANSFER_IN_A_VERTICAL_SMALL-DIAMETER_TUBE_EFFECT_OF_DIFFERENT_FLUIDS_AND_SURFACE_CHARACTERISTICS","315637388_Flow_boiling_heat_transfer_of_R134a_in_multi_microchannels","313446294_Critical_heat_flux_enhancement_of_HFE-7100_flow_boiling_in_a_minichannel_heat_sink_with_saw-tooth_structures","322016917_Prediction_of_Pressure_Drop_for_Flow_Boiling_in_Rectangular_Multi-Microchannel_Heat_Sinks","319208729_Performance_of_a_micro_scale_integrated_thermal_management_system","312872545_Frictional_Pressure_Drop_Correlation_for_Two-Phase_Flows_in_Mini_and_Micro_Multi-Channels","312466931_Fundamental_issues_mechanisms_and_models_of_flow_boiling_heat_transfer_in_microscale_channels","312320403_Flow_boiling_heat_transfer_of_R134a_and_low_GWP_refrigerants_in_a_horizontal_micro-scale_channel"]}
