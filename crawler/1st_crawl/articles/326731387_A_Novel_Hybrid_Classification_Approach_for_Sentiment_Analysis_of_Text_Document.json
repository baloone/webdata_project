{"id":"326731387_A_Novel_Hybrid_Classification_Approach_for_Sentiment_Analysis_of_Text_Document","abstract":"Sentiment analysis is a more popular area of highly active research in Automatic Language Processing. She assigns a negative or positive polarity to one or more entities using different natural language processing tools and also predicted high and low performance of various sentiment classifiers. Our approach focuses on the analysis of feelings resulting from reviews of products using original text search techniques. These reviews can be classified as having a positive or negative feeling based on certain aspects in relation to a query based on terms. In this paper, we chose to use two automatic learning methods for classification: Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest, and we introduce a novel hybrid approach to identify product reviews offered by Amazon. This is useful for consumers who want to research the sentiment of products before purchase, or companies that want to monitor the public sentiment of their brands. The results summarize that the proposed method outperforms these individual classifiers in this amazon dataset.","authors":["Yassine Al-Amrani","Mohamed LAZAAR","kamal eddine el kadiri"],"meta":["December 2018International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering 8(6)","DOI:10.11591/ijece.v8i6.pp4554-4567","Projects: SENTIMENT ANALYSISOPTIMISATON OF CLASSIFICATION MODELS"],"references":["324531717_Sentiment_Analysis_Using_Hybrid_Method_of_Support_Vector_Machine_and_Decision_Tree","318272386_Comparison_of_Accuracy_Measures_for_RS_Image_Classification_using_SVM_and_ANN_Classifiers","286272892_Analysis_of_different_approaches_to_Sentence-Level_Sentiment_Classification","241124251_Incorporating_Spatial_Variability_Measures_in_Land-cover_Classification_using_Random_Forest","318797789_Sentiment_Analysis_using_supervised_classification_algorithms","313715625_Ensemble_of_feature_sets_and_classification_algorithms_for_sentiment_classification","308959387_Review_on_Opinion_Mining_for_Fully_Fledged_System","305622270_Sentiment_Analysis_and_Opinion_Mining","276841297_Sentiment_Analysis_Using_Weka","257296589_A_support_vector_machine_approach_to_CMOS-based_radar_signal_processing_for_vehicle_classification_and_speed_estimation"]}
