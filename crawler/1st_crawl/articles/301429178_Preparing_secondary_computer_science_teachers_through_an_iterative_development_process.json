The Institute for Computing Education (ICE) has been offering teacher professional development in an attempt to increase the quantity and quality of secondary computing teachers in Georgia in the United States of America since 2004. We have developed our teacher professional development over the last ten years with an iterative cycle of design, development, delivery, and evaluation.","authors":["Barbara Ericson","Mark Guzdial","Tom Mcklin"],"meta":["November 2014","DOI:10.1145/2670757.2670781","Conference: the 9th Workshop in Primary and Secondary Computing Education"],"references":["257137269_Bringing_Computer_Science_Back_Into_Schools_Lessons_from_the_UK","254462921_Adapting_the_disciplinary_commons_model_for_high_school_teachers_Improving_recruitment_creating_community","254007497_Who_AM_I_understanding_high_school_computer_science_teachers'_professional_identity","221537948_Georgia_Computes_Improving_the_computing_education_pipeline","221536756_A_CS1_course_designed_to_address_interests_of_women","38413358_Scratch_for_Budding_Computer_Scientists","281038162_Georgia_Computes_An_Intervention_in_a_US_State_with_Formal_and_Informal_Education_in_a_Policy_Context","271452202_Improving_secondary_CS_education","262176812_CS_principles_professional_development_only_9500_to_go","248028285_The_success_case_method_Find_out_quickly_what''s_working_and_what''s_not","243769802_Those_Who_Understand_Knowledge_Growth_in_Teaching","242473344_Knowledge_and_Teaching_Foundations_of_the_New_Reform","220094516_The_Design_of_Alice"]}
