{"id":"252251360_Equivalence_of_realizability_conditions_for_nonlinear_control_systems","abstract":"The relationship between three state space realizability c onditions for nonlinear multi-input multi-output differential equations, formul ated in terms of different mathematical tools, is studied. Moreover, explicit formulae are provide d for calculating the differentials of the state coordinates which, in case the necessary and suffic ient realizability conditions are satisfied, can be integrated to obtain the state coordinates . The main differences in comparison with the single-input single-output case are clarified.","authors":["Ãœ.
