{"id":"320207260_COMPUTER_MODELING_TRAINING_IN_PRIMARY_SCHOOL_-_RESULTS_CONCLUSIONS_AND_ASSESSMENTS","abstract":"The introduction of the computer modeling as new school subject in the elementary school from the 2018/19 school year is largely aimed at compensating for the gap between the knowledge gained so far and the realities in the information society. Over the last few years, an experimental computer modeling training has been conducted in the district of Plovdiv in the hours for elective training with primary school pupils. The authors in this article will share the experience gained in the training, will present on the results obtained and will draw some conclusions that may prove useful in the future planning and organization of the work in this school subject at the compulsory classes in the Bulgarian school.","authors":["Veneta Tabakova-Komsalova","Todorka Glushkova"],"meta":["August 2017","DOI:10.26883/2010.171.283","Project: ФП17-ФМИ-008"],"references":[]}
