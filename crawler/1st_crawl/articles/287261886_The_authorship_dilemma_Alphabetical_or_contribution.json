{"id":"287261886_The_authorship_dilemma_Alphabetical_or_contribution","abstract":"Academic communities have adopted different conventions for ordering authors on academic publications. Are these choices inconsequential, or can they significantly impact individual authors, or even communities at large? We consider a game theoretic model to study allocation of credit to authors; in particular, we find that alphabetical ordering can lead to higher research quality, while ordering by contribution results in a denser collaboration network and more publications.
