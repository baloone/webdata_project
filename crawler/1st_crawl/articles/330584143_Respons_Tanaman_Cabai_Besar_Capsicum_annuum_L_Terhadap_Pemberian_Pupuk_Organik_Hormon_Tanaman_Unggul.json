The research was conducted at Gunung Nona, Benteng Village, Nusaniwe Subdistrict, Ambon City, from April to September 2012. The research experiment was arranged in a Completely Randomized Design (CRD) with 3 replications. The experimental factor was the concentration of superior plant hormone organic fertilizer, consisting of P0 = without fertilizer (control), P1 = 1 ml/l, P2 = 2 ml/l, P3 = 3 ml/l, and P4 = 4 ml/l. The results showed that the concentration of superior plant hormone organic fertilizer influenced significantly on plant growth and yield of large chilli plants, and at a treatment of 3 ml / l the number of harvested fruit per plant was 70,58 and fruit weight was 241.67 grams","authors":["M.
