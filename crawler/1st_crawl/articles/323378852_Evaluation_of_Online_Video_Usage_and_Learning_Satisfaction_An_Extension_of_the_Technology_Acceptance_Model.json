{"id":"323378852_Evaluation_of_Online_Video_Usage_and_Learning_Satisfaction_An_Extension_of_the_Technology_Acceptance_Model","abstract":"p class=\"3\">The aim of the study was to examine the determining factors of students' video usage and their learning satisfaction relating to the supplementary application of educational videos, accessible in a Moodle environment in a Business Mathematics Course. The research model is based on the extension of Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), in which the core TAM constructs – perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, attitude – and internet self-efficacy were included as the explanatory factors of video usage. As regards the determinants of learning satisfaction, beside the core TAM constructs, the role of learning performance, learner-learner interaction, and learner-teacher interaction was examined. Data were collected from 89 students using a questionnaire, on which the partial least-squares structural equation modelling approach was used to evaluate the research model. The results confirmed that perceived usefulness, attitude, and internet self-efficacy had a direct effect on the video usage. Learning satisfaction was directly influenced by learner-learner interaction, perceived ease of use, and learning performance. Furthermore, the results indicated that video usage had a significant effect both on learning performance and on learning satisfaction. The findings show that the extended TAM model can be applied for predicting the university students' video technology usage and their learning satisfaction regarding the usage.</p","authors":["Judit T Nagy"],"meta":["February 2018International Review of Research in Open and Distance Learning 19(1)","DOI:10.19173/irrodl.v19i1.2886"],"references":["287360679_Developing_a_General_Extended_Technology_Acceptance_Model_for_E-Learning_GETAMEL_by_analysing_commonly_used_external_factors","277152461_Predictors_of_Learning_Satisfaction_in_Japanese_Online_Distance_Learners","272889075_Making_Sense_of_Video_Analytics_Lessons_Learned_from_Clickstream_Interactions_Attitudes_and_Learning_Outcome_in_a_Video-Assisted_Course","271674280_Factors_Affecting_Students'_Usage_of_Learning_Management_System_at_the_University_of_Jordan","313604424_Evaluating_Structural_Equation_Models_with_Unobservable_Variables_and_Measurement_Error","292390755_Understanding_e-learning_continuance_intention_An_extension_of_the_technology_acceptance_model","288254859_Multivariate_data_analysis_Prentice_Hall","285831994_Self-Efficacy_The_Exercise_of_Control","279506104_Podcasts_Are_they_an_effective_tool_to_enhance_student_learning_A_Case_Study","279043164_An_empirical_examination_of_individual_and_system_characteristics_on_enhancing_e-learning_acceptance"]}
