This article presents a new approach and the initial feedback in a research that seeks to provoke reflections and reactions to different stakeholders on future changes in their living territory. This project is divided into two stages. The first is a production of different scenarios of changes in land use, associated with a 3D virtual representation of landscape. The second stage is a participatory workshop in small groups of stakeholders. The shared collective thinking is based on 3D virtual representations of transformations of space that were chosen by the participants from an application designed for this project. The study area, located on the coastal zone of Alpes-Maritimes, is very threatened by fast and diffuse urbanization. \n\nKEYWORDS: spatial modelling, cellular automata, machine learning, simulation, landscape, 3D, geo-prospective, participatory approach,","authors":["Jc Loubier","Christine Voiron-Canicio","Dominique Genoud","Daniel Hunacek"],"meta":["October 2017Revue Internationale de GÃ©omatique 27(4):547-566","DOI:10.3166/rig.2017.00042","Project: VIPLIMED"],"references":["276261440_Simuler_les_evolutions_de_l'utilisation_du_sol_pour_anticiper_le_futur_d'un_territoire_Analyse_critique_d'une_experience_de_geoprospective_dans_un_bassin_versant_periurbain_de_l'agglomeration_lyonnais","271204458_Usages_de_modeles_spatiaux_pour_la_prospective","267632815_L'anticipation_du_changement_en_prospective_et_des_changements_spatiaux_en_geoprospective","267631509_L'espace_dans_la_modelisation_des_interactions_nature-societe","342001482_La_modelisation_d'accompagnement_Une_demarche_participative_en_appui_au_developpement_durable","311336005_La_modelisation_d'accompagnement_une_forme_particuliere_de_geoprospective","289526355_Description_and_validation_of_a_non_path-dependent_model_for_projecting_contrasting_urban_growth_futures","281353751_Modelling_and_projecting_land-use_and_land-cover_changes_with_a_cellular_automaton_in_considering_landscape_trajectories_an_improvement_for_simulation_of_plausible_future_states","272435266_Geovisualisations_3D_en_action_dans_l'amenagement_du_territoire","272020670_Evaluating_Cross-Platform_Development_Approaches_for_Mobile_Applications"]}
