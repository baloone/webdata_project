{"id":"317776592_sureTrust_a_super_peer-aware_trust_model_for_2-level_P2P_networks","abstract":"With the growth of P2P applications, more and more trust models have been proposed for curbing malicious behavior, most of which are suitable for pure P2P networks, including the structured P2P networks and the unstructured P2P networks. This paper presents a super peer-aware trust model, sureTrust, for 2-level P2P networks. The super peer of a subnet is responsible for calculating the peers’ trust in its subnet, and the super peer’s trust is correlated with the trust of the peers in its subnet. To discourage peers from behaving maliciously, we allow a peer to establish transactions only with the peers whose trust is similar to that of the peer. Also, a super peer could separate the connections of a peer in its subnet to the outside subnets as the punishment on the peer’s behavior. The simulation results show that the sureTrust model could improve normal peers’ successful download rate and resist different types of attacks.","authors":["Xianfu Meng"],"meta":["May 2018Peer-to-Peer Networking and Applications 11(11):1-13","DOI:10.1007/s12083-017-0577-1"],"references":["284076475_An_Eigentrust_dynamic_evolutionary_model_in_P2P_file-sharing_systems","260586977_SORT_A_Self-ORganizing_Trust_Model_for_Peer-to-peer_Systems","265908925_Trust-based_incentive_mechanism_to_motivate_cooperation_in_hybrid_P2P_networks","262403678_Behavior-based_reputation_management_in_P2P_file-sharing_networks","261424320_Research_on_a_P2P_supper_node_selection_mechanism_based_on_trust_model","260586979_SecuredTrust_A_Dynamic_Trust_Computation_Model_for_Secured_Communication_in_Multiagent_Systems","256942116_Trust_A_trust_model_based_on_feedback-arbitration_in_structured_P2P_network","251934834_Trust-based_supernode_selection_in_peer-to-peer_systems","244277937_Peertrust_Supporting_reputation_-based_trust_in_peer-to-peer_communities","241081279_R_2_Trust_a_reputation_and_risk_based_trust_management_framework_for_large-scale_fully_decentralized_overlay_networks","222064260_Fuzzy_trust_evaluation_and_credibility_development_in_multi-agent_systems","232657017_Scalable_Feedback_Aggregating_SFA_Overlay_for_Large-Scale_P2P_Trust_Management","228955281_Trust_Among_Strangers_in_Internet_Transactions_Empirical_Analysis_of_eBay's_Reputation_System","222420387_The_FastTrack_overlay_A_measurement_study","221452028_PBTrust_A_Priority-Based_Trust_Model_for_Service_Selection_in_General_Service-Oriented_Environments"]}
