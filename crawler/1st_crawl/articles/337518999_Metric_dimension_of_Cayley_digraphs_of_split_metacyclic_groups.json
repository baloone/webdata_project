{"id":"337518999_Metric_dimension_of_Cayley_digraphs_of_split_metacyclic_groups","abstract":"A directed Cayley graph Cay(Γ,X) is specified by a group Γ and an identity-free generating set X for this group. Vertices of Cay(Γ,X) are elements of Γ and there is a directed edge from a vertex u to a vertex v in Cay(Γ,X) if and only if there is a generator x∈X such that ux=v. We study the metric dimension for the directed Cayley graphs Cay(Γs,{a,b}) of general split metacyclic groups, and present the exact values of the metric dimension for the special split metacyclic groups Γs=〈a,b|an=b2s=1,ba=a−1b〉.","authors":["Marcel Abas","Tomas Vetrik"],"meta":["November 2019Theoretical Computer Science 809(4)","DOI:10.1016/j.tcs.2019.11.025"],"references":["316568673_The_metric_dimension_of_circulant_graphs_and_their_Cartesian_products","230737127_Minimum_Metric_Dimension_of_Silicate_Networks","220620982_The_Metric_Dimension_of_Cayley_Digraphs_of_Abelian_Groups","305415860_The_Metric_Dimension_of_Circulant_Graphs","303151748_Leaves_of_trees","286283233_Minimum_Metric_Dimension_of_Illiac_Networks","268251279_The_directed_distance_dimension_of_oriented_graphs","264960330_On_the_metric_dimension_of_a_graph","223400281_The_metric_dimension_of_Cayley_digraphs","223217500_Landmarks_in_graphs","222514864_Resolvability_in_graphs_and_the_metric_dimension_of_a_graph","220632415_Metric_bases_in_digital_geometry"]}
