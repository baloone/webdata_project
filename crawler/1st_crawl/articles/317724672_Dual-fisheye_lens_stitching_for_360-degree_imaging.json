{"id":"317724672_Dual-fisheye_lens_stitching_for_360-degree_imaging","abstract":"Dual-fisheye lens cameras have been increasingly used for 360-degree immersive imaging. However, the limited overlapping field of views and misalignment between the two lenses give rise to visible discontinuities in the stitching boundaries. This paper introduces a novel method for dual-fisheye camera stitching that adaptively minimizes the discontinuities in the overlapping regions to generate full spherical 360-degree images. Results show that this approach can produce good quality stitched images for Samsung Gear 360 -- a dual-fisheye camera, even with hard-to-stitch objects in the stitching borders.","authors":["Tuan Ho","Madhukar Budagavi"],"meta":["March 2017","DOI:10.1109/ICASSP.2017.7952541","Conference: ICASSP 2017 - 2017 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","Project: 360-degree video stitching"],"references":["221410132_A_Flexible_Technique_for_Accurate_Omnidirectional_Camera_Calibration_and_Structure_from_Motion","29612104_A_Toolbox_for_Easily_Calibrating_Omnidirectional_Cameras","225133245_Automatic_Panoramic_Image_Stitching_using_Invariant_Features","221572285_VLFeat_An_open_and_portable_library_of_computer_vision_algorithms","215458920_Multi-View_Geometry_in_Computer_Vision","3703141_Catadioptric_Omnidirectional_Camera"]}
