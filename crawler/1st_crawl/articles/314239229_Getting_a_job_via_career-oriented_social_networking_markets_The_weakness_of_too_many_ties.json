{"id":"314239229_Getting_a_job_via_career-oriented_social_networking_markets_The_weakness_of_too_many_ties","abstract":"While career-oriented social networking markets (CSNM) such as LinkedIn or XING are increasingly appreciated by a large number of internet users, our understanding of CSNM benefits and factors influencing the intention to use CSNM for a job search is very limited. For theoretical work on CSNM I extend Venkatesh's et al. UTAUT2 model by presenting a new concept considering a user's ties based on Granovetter's social network theory. The evaluation of the extended model, which asks users of CSNM about their job search behavior and their search success, shows a predictive quality increase from 19.0 percent to 80.5 percent. Post hoc analyses reveal a substantial negative relationship between the number of a user's ties and its job search success, which supports the experience of practitioners but contradicts scholarly findings. A level of about 150 contacts is most effective in terms of getting job offers, which confirms Dunbar's number. The results are useful for scholars and practitioners.","authors":["Ricardo Buettner"],"meta":["November 2017Electronic Markets 27(4):371-385","DOI:10.1007/s12525-017-0248-3","Project: efficient Recruiting 2.0"],"references":["344799678_A_Systematic_Literature_Review_of_Twitter_Research_from_a_Socio-Political_Revolution_Perspective","330691646_Getting_a_Job_A_Study_of_Contacts_and_Careers","328261301_On_Facebook_most_ties_are_weak","323424582_Statistical_power_analysis_for_the_behavioral_sciences","318722751_Asymptotic_confidence_intervals_for_indirect_effects_in_structural_equation_models","313765310_Antecedents_and_consequences_of_corporate_weblog_usage_in_the_intranet_A_process_perspective","313604424_Evaluating_Structural_Equation_Models_with_Unobservable_Variables_and_Measurement_Error","312984568_Perceived_usefulness_perceived_ease_and_user_acceptance_of_information_technology","312973384_Evolution_of_the_social_brain","312673071_PLS-SEM_indeed_a_silver_bullet"]}
