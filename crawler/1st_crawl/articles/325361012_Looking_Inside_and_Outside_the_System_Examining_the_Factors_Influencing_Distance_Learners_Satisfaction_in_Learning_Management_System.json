{"id":"325361012_Looking_Inside_and_Outside_the_System_Examining_the_Factors_Influencing_Distance_Learners_Satisfaction_in_Learning_Management_System","abstract":"In the last few years, the use of educational technology, particularly the concept of Learning Management System (LMS), has increased rapidly. With this fast development, the question arises as how to manage the LMS to obtain success and efficiency in online courses. One of the important factors that have received many citations in literature studies (and has a special position in information system research) is the user satisfaction. It is a crucial factor that can predict the success or failure of any LMS. In relation, this research examined the success factors that affect the user satisfaction and outcomes of LMS. This paper discusses the conceptual User Satisfaction Evaluation Model (USEM) employed to measures LMS success. In particular, it seeks to examine \"the relationship between: Service quality, system quality, ease of use, perceived usefulness, information quality and students satisfaction, as well as to measure the outcomes of the LMS.\" Results from the data analysis indicate that all proposed factors have a positive effect on student satisfaction. The result also concludes that a higher rate of user satisfaction will lead to greater benefits for the students.","authors":["Ibrahim Almarashdeh","Mutasem Khalil Alsmadi","Ghaith M.
