{"id":"221102923_A_Description_Language_for_Syntactically_Annotated_Corpora","abstract":"This paper introduces a description language for syntactically annotated corpora which allows for encoding both the syntactic annotation to a corpus and the queries to a syntactically annotated corpus.In terms of descriptive adequacy and computational efficiency, the description language is a compromise between script-like corpus query languages and high-level, typed unification-based grammar formalisms.","authors":["Esther König","Wolfgang Lezius"],"meta":["January 2000","DOI:10.3115/992730.992804","SourceDBLP","Conference: COLING 2000, 18th International Conference on Computational Linguistics, Proceedings of the Conference, 2 Volumes, July 31 - August 4, 2000, Universität des Saarlandes, Saarbrücken, Germany"],"references":["2462366_A_Linguistically_Interpreted_Corpus_of_German_Newspaper_Text","2330952_An_XML-based_representation_format_for_syntactically_annotated_corpora","1955031_Towards_A_Query_Language_for_Annotation_Graphs","319393691_The_Logic_of_Typed_Feature_Structures","277292956_The_TIGER_language_A_Description_Language_for_Syntax_Graphs","243764153_Denite_Relations_over_Constraint_Languages_Lilog_report_53","221419287_A_Fixed-Point_Semantics_for_Feature_Type_Systems","220441308_Fibred_Semantics_for_Feature-Based_Grammar_Logic","2301036_CUF_-_A_Formalism_for_Linguistic_Knowledge_Representation"]}
