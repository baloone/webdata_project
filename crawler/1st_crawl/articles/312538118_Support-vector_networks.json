{"id":"312538118_Support-vector_networks","abstract":"Thesupport-vector network is a new learning machine for two-group classification problems. The machine conceptually implements the following idea: input vectors are non-linearly mapped to a very high-dimension feature space. In this feature space a linear decision surface is constructed. Special properties of the decision surface ensures high generalization ability of the learning machine. The idea behind the support-vector network was previously implemented for the restricted case where the training data can be separated without errors. We here extend this result to non-separable training data.High generalization ability of support-vector networks utilizing polynomial input transformations is demonstrated. We also compare the performance of the support-vector network to various classical learning algorithms that all took part in a benchmark study of Optical Character Recognition.","authors":["Corinna Cortes","Vladimir Vapnik"],"meta":["January 2009Chemical Biology & Drug Design 297(3):273-297","DOI:10.1007/%2FBF00994018"],"references":["246929280_Neural-network_and_K-nearest-neighbor_Classifiers","3684535_Comparison_of_classifier_methods_a_case_study_in_handwritten_digit_recognition","2376111_A_Training_Algorithm_for_Optimal_Margin_Classifier","275807826_Principles_of_Neurodynamics","267169218_Estimation_of_dependences_based_on_empirical_data_Transl_from_the_Russian_by_Samuel_Kotz","260869480_The_Use_of_Multiple_Measurements_in_Taxonomic_Problems","248857140_Theoretical_Foundations_of_the_potential_function_method_in_pattern_recognition","243743707_Learning_Internal_Representations_by_Error_Propagation","239059398_Leaning_internal_representations_by_back-propagating_errors","236736807_Estimation_of_Dependences_Based_on_Empirical_Data","229091480_Learning_Representations_by_Back_Propagating_Errors","229091433_Principles_of_Neurodynamics_Perceptrons_and_the_Theory_of_Brain_Mechanisms","38366305_Classification_into_two_Multivariate_Normal_Distributions_with_Different_Covariance_Matrices","2439558_Handwritten_Digit_Recognition_with_a_Back-Propagation_Network"]}
