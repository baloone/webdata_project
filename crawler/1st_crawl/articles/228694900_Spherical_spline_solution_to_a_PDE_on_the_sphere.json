{"id":"228694900_Spherical_spline_solution_to_a_PDE_on_the_sphere","abstract":"We use splines on spherical triangulations to approxi-mate the solution of a second order elliptic PDE over the unit sphere. We establish existence and uniqueness of weak solutions in spherical spline spaces and estimate convergence of the spline approximations. We present a computational algorithm and summarize numerical re-sults on convergence rates.","authors":["Victoria Baramidze","Ming-Jun Lai"],"meta":["January 2005"],"references":["268257133_Spherical_Splines_for_Scattered_Data_Fitting","266703526_The_L_2_S_n_error_estimate_for_the_Galerkin_method_for_elliptic_PDEs_on_spheres","228700564_Error_bounds_for_minimal_energy_interpolatory_spherical_splines","225198350_On_the_Approximation_Order_of_Splines_on_Spherical_Triangulations","267439360_The_multivariate_spline_mehtod_for_scattered_data_fitting_and_numerical_solution_of_partial_differential_equations","265461826_Computing_Fourier_Transforms_and_Convolutions_on_the_2-Sphere","226769574_Approximation_of_parabolic_PDEs_on_spheres_using_spherical_basis_functions","222567190_Error_Bounds_for_Solving_Pseudodifferential_Equations_on_Spheres_by_Collocation_with_Zonal_Kernels","222453699_Bernstein-Bezier_polynomials_on_spheres_and_sphere-like_surfaces","220576514_A_fast_spherical_harmonics_transform_algorithm","220411556_Spherical_Splines_for_Data_Interpolation_and_Fitting","2509001_Bernstein-B'ezier_Polynomials_on_Spheres_and_Sphere-Like_Surfaces","220163005_Galerkin_approximation_for_elliptic_PDEs_on_spheres","51992270_On_convergence_rate_of_the_augmented_Lagrangian_algorithm_for_nonsymmetric_saddle_point_problems","2295233_Fast_and_stable_algorithms_for_discrete_spherical_Fourier_transforms"]}
