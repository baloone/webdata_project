{"id":"306229979_On_the_Steady-State_Control_of_Timed_Event_Graphs_with_Firing_Date_Constraints","abstract":"Two algorithms for solving a specific class of steady-state control problems for Timed Event Graphs are presented. In the first, asymptotic convergence to the desired set is guaranteed. The second algorithm, which builds on from the recent developments in the spectral theory of min-max functions, guarantees Lyapunov stability since the distance between the actual state and the desired set never increases. Simulation results show the efficiency of the proposed approach in a problem of moderate complexity.","authors":["V.M.
