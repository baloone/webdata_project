{"id":"344858048_The_Capacity_of_Quantum_Neural_Networks","abstract":"Quantum neural networks (QNN) are a promising application of near-term quantum computers. We present an information theory of QNNâ€™s expressive power, which we apply to an example optical QNN based on a Gaussian Boson Sampler.","authors":["Logan G Wright","Peter L.
