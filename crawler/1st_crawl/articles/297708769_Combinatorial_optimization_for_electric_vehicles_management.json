{"id":"297708769_Combinatorial_optimization_for_electric_vehicles_management","abstract":"Growing concerns about environmental quality of cities are calling for sustainable road transportation technologies. Electric Vehicles (EV), for public and private transport, can contribute signicantly to the lowering of the current pollution levels. However, the EV use is currently facing several weaknesses among which are: limited driving range, high cost and overall limited eciency. This paper aims at specifying some key contributions of combinatorial optimization for an ecient electric vehicles management. Electric vehicles management, Routing problem, Facility location, Vehicles redistribution.","authors":["Nora Touati","Vincent Jost"],"meta":["January 2012","DOI:10.24084/repqj09.504"],"references":["267971870_Redistribution_of_Self-service_Electric_Cars_A_Case_of_Pickup_and_Delivery","227142556_Shortest_Path_Problems_with_Resource_Constraints","227014295_Management_of_a_pool_of_self-service_cars","226255592_Vehicle_Routing_Problem_with_Time_Windows","220412917_The_Shortest_Path_Problem_with_Time_Windows_and_Linear_Waiting_Costs","220288305_From_Single-Objective_to_Multi-Objective_Vehicle_Routing_Problems_Motivations_Case_Studies_and_Method","285022113_A_flow-capturing_location-allocation_model","245280290_Modelling_IntraCity_Time-Dependent_Travel_Speeds_for_Vehicle_Scheduling_Problems","240123866_Electric_Vehicles_Effect_of_the_Availability_Threshold_on_the_Transportation_Cost","233843451_The_Vehicle_Routing_Problem","229127117_Locating_battery_exchange_stations_to_serve_tourism_transport_A_note","226349358_A_survey_on_pickup_and_delivery_problems_Part_II_Transportation_between_pickup_and_delivery_locations","223551041_An_optimal_location_choice_model_for_recreation-oriented_scooter_recharge_stations","223528547_Locating_road-vehicle_refueling_stations","223232425_The_Flow-Refueling_Location_Problem_for_Alternative-Fuel_Vehicles","222802776_The_Maximum_CoveringShortest_Path_Problem_A_Multiobjective_Network_Design_and_Routing_Formulation","222697006_Initiating_hydrogen_infrastructures_Preliminary_analysis_of_a_sufficient_number_of_initial_hydrogen_stations_in_the_US","222573324_Infrastructure_development_for_conversion_to_environmentally_friendly_fuel","222293690_Locating_passenger_vehicle_refueling_stations","220273735_Selected_Multicriteria_Shortest_Path_Problems_An_Analysis_of_Complexity_Models_and_Adaptation_of_Standard_Algorithms"]}
