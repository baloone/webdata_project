{"id":"336216201_Reduced_network_extremal_ensemble_learning_RenEEL_scheme_for_community_detection_in_complex_networks","abstract":"We introduce an ensemble learning scheme for community detection in complex networks. The scheme uses a Machine Learning algorithmic paradigm we call Extremal Ensemble Learning. It uses iterative extremal updating of an ensemble of network partitions, which can be found by a conventional base algorithm, to find a node partition that maximizes modularity. At each iteration, core groups of nodes that are in the same community in every ensemble partition are identified and used to form a reduced network. Partitions of the reduced network are then found and used to update the ensemble. The smaller size of the reduced network makes the scheme efficient. We use the scheme to analyze the community structure in a set of commonly studied benchmark networks and find that it outperforms all other known methods for finding the partition with maximum modularity.","authors":["Jiahao Guo","Pramesh Singh","Kevin E.
