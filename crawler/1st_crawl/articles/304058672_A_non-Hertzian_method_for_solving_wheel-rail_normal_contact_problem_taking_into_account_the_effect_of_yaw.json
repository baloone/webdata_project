{"id":"304058672_A_non-Hertzian_method_for_solving_wheel-rail_normal_contact_problem_taking_into_account_the_effect_of_yaw","abstract":"** Full text available(first 50): http://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/HfZjgfUPkJGTJRCCbhnm/full ** A novel approach is proposed in this paper to deal with non-Hertzian normal contact in wheel–rail interface, extending the widely used Kik–Piotrowski method. The new approach is able to consider the effect of the yaw angle of the wheelset against the rail on the shape of the contact patch and on pressure distribution. Furthermore, the method considers the variation of profile curvature across the contact patch, enhancing the correspondence to CONTACT for highly non-Hertzian contact conditions. The simulation results show that the proposed method can provide more accurate estimation than the original algorithm compared to Kalker’s CONTACT, and that the influence of yaw on the contact results is significant under certain circumstances.","authors":["Binbin Liu","Stefano Bruni","Edwin A.
