{"id":"223295622_Finding_odd_cycle_transversals","abstract":"We present an O(mn) algorithm to determine whether a graph G with m edges and n vertices has an odd cycle transversal of order at most k, for any fixed k. We also obtain an algorithm that determines, in the same time, whether a graph has a half integral packing of odd cycles of weight k.","authors":["Bruce Reed","Kaleigh Smith","Adrian Vetta"],"meta":["July 2004Operations Research Letters 32(4):299-301","DOI:10.1016/j.orl.2003.10.009","SourceDBLP"],"references":["221580898_Reducibility_Among_Combinatorial_Problems","221313480_Practical_Algorithms_and_Fixed-Parameter_Tractability_for_the_Single_Individual_SNP_Haplotyping_Problem","313196027_Reducibility_among_combinatorial_problems","284039089_Reducibility_among_combinatorial_problems","265435677_Graph_minors_XIII_The_disjoint_paths_problem","243787873_Compexity_of_Computer_Computations","220441445_Mangoes_and_Blueberries"]}
