{"id":"267632815_L'anticipation_du_changement_en_prospective_et_des_changements_spatiaux_en_geoprospective","abstract":"At a time when the present economic and financial models are being questioned as to their ability to forecast extreme events and resulting crises, this article considers the issue of how to anticipate change, and more particularly spatial change in a geoprospective approach. It proposes a critical\nanalysis of the methods, theories and empirical practices designed to forecast coming change, whether change is considered probably or merely possible.\nParticular attention is paid to the meaning of spatial change and the issue of spatial\nemergence. New lines of research combining quantitative and qualitative approaches are also proposed.","authors":["Christine Voiron-Canicio"],"meta":["June 2012L'Espace g√©ographique 41(2)","DOI:10.3917/eg.412.0099"],"references":["226325963_Predicting_the_Urban_Spread_Using_Spatio-morphological_Models","346790326_Fuzzy_sets_as_a_basis_for_a_theory_of_possibility","345267914_Reinventer_le_tempsReinventing_Time","332547313_Variogrammes_et_structures_spatiales_Collection_Reclus_Mode_d'Emploi_GIP_RECLUS_Montpellier","310953483_Ce_que_les_dynamiques_foncieres_revelent_du_devenir_des_territoires_elements_de_prospective_du_sud-est_francais","239666190_Critical_Phenomena_in_Natural_Sciences","227723021_Normal_Inverse_Gaussian_Distributions_and_Stochastic_Volatility_Modelling","222716719_Autocorrelation_spatiale_lecons_du_changement_d'echelle","222304770_Fuzzy_Sets_as_a_Basis_for_Theory_of_Possibility","50207280_Lois_d'Echelle_Fractales_et_Ondelettes"]}
