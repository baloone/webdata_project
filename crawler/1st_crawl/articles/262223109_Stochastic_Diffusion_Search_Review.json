{"id":"262223109_Stochastic_Diffusion_Search_Review","abstract":"Stochastic Diffusion Search, first incepted in 1989, belongs to the extended family of swarm intelligence algorithms.\nIn contrast to many nature-inspired algorithms, stochastic diffusion search has a strong mathematical framework\ndescribing its behaviour and convergence. In addition to concisely exploring the algorithm in the context of natural\nswarm intelligence systems, this paper reviews various developments of the algorithm, which have been shown to\nperform well in a variety of application domains including continuous optimisation, implementation on hardware and\nmedical imaging. This algorithm has also being utilised to argue the potential computational creativity of swarm\nintelligence systems through the two phases of exploration and exploitation.","authors":["Mohammad Majid Al-Rifaie","John Mark Bishop"],"meta":["January 2013Paladyn, Journal of Behavioral Robotics 4(3):155-173","DOI:10.2478/pjbr-2013-0021","In book: Paladyn, Journal of Behavioral Robotics (pp.155-173)Publisher: Paladyn, Journal of Behavioral Robotics","Project: Swarm Intelligence"],"references":["328170624_Recruiting_robots_perform_stochastic_diffusion_search","287275079_Stochastic_diffusion_search_applied_to_trees_A_swarm_intelligence_heuristic_performing_Monte-Carlo_tree_search","314794781_An_agent_based_approach_to_site_selection_for_wireless_networks","313749844_Particle_swarm_optimization","313706874_Adaptation_in_natural_and_artificial_systems","313029178_Evolutionary_optimization_for_computationally_expensive_problems_using_Gaussian_processes","312816335_Swarm_Intelligence","304425270_Differential_Evolution_-_A_Simple_and_Efficient_Heuristic_for_global_Optimization_over_Continuous_Spaces","301232798_Probabilistic_Behavior_in_Ants_-_a_Strategy_of_Errors","287275076_Stochastic_diffusion_search_algorithm_for_quadratic_knapsack_problem"]}
