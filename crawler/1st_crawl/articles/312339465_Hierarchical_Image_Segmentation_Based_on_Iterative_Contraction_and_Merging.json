{"id":"312339465_Hierarchical_Image_Segmentation_Based_on_Iterative_Contraction_and_Merging","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a new framework for hierarchical image segmentation based on iterative contraction and merging (ICM). In the proposed framework, we treat the hierarchical image segmentation problem as a sequel of optimization problems, with each optimization process being realized by a contraction-and-merging process to identify and merge the most similar data pairs at the current resolution. At the beginning, we perform pixel-based contraction and merging to quickly combine image pixels into initial region-elements with visually indistinguishable intra-region color difference. After that, we iteratively perform region-based contraction and merging to group adjacent regions into larger ones to progressively form a segmentation dendrogram for hierarchical segmentation. Comparing to the state-of-the-art techniques, the proposed algorithm can not only produce high-quality segmentation results in a more efficient way, but also keep a lot of boundary details in the segmentation results.","authors":["Jia-Hao Syu","Sheng-Jyh Wang","Li-Chun Wang"],"meta":["January 2017IEEE Transactions on Image Processing PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TIP.2017.2651395"],"references":["261263532_Image_Segmentation_by_Cascaded_Region_Agglomeration","225496431_TextonBoost_Joint_Appearance_Shape_and_Context_Modeling_for_Multi-class_Object_Recognition_and_Segmentation","224506242_Automatic_Image_Segmentation_by_Dynamic_Region_Growth_and_Multiresolution_Merging","224219067_Natural_Image_Segmentation_Based_on_Tree_Equipartition_Bayesian_Flooding_and_Region_Merging","220659463_The_Pascal_Visual_Object_Classes_VOC_challenge","51235952_Image_Segmentation_by_Probabilistic_Bottom-Up_Aggregation_and_Cue_Integration","51162685_Automatic_Image_Segmentation_by_Dynamic_Region_Merging","45821321_Contour_Detection_and_Hierarchical_Image_Segmentation","45200132_WLD_A_robust_local_image_descriptor","6975028_Hierarchy_and_adaptivity_in_segmenting_visual_scenes","6397810_Toward_Objective_Evaluation_of_Image_Segmentation_Algorithms","2378335_Digital_Color_Imaging","314100361_Indoor_Segmentation_and_Support_Inference_from_RGBD_Images","284040965_Mean_shift_A_robust_approach_toward_feature_space_analysis","262815444_Learning-Based_Hierarchical_Graph_for_Unsupervised_Matting_and_Foreground_Estimation","262222168_Indoor_Segmentation_and_Support_Inference_from_RGBD_Images","236916468_Learning_Full_Pairwise_Affinities_for_Spectral_Segmentation","228723293_Boundary_extraction_in_natural_images_using_ultrametric_contour_maps","226763007_Comparing_Clusterings_by_the_Variation_of_Information","224135950_Decomposing_a_Scene_into_Geometric_and_Semantically_Consistent_Regions","221497604_Comparing_clusterings_by_the_variation_of_information","221364208_Spectral_Segmentation_with_Multiscale_Graph_Decomposition","221259634_Improving_Spatial_Support_for_Objects_via_Multiple_Segmentations","220182043_Watersheds_in_Digital_Spaces_An_Efficient_Algorithm_Based_on_Immersion_Simulations","215721562_Efficient_Graph-Based_Image_Segmentation","3327387_Perceptually_uniform_color_spaces_for_color_texture_analysis_An_empirical_evaluation","3191920_Soille_P_Watersheds_in_digital_spaces_an_efficient_algorithm_based_on_immersion_simulations_IEEE_Trans_on_PAMI_136_583-598","2477494_Normalized_Cuts_and_Image_Segmentation"]}
