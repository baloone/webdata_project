{"id":"307476568_Curriculum_Guidelines_for_Master's_Level_Programs_in_Information_Systems_for_Emergency_Management","abstract":"Curriculum guidelines are presented for Master's level programs that combine core topics from the disciplines of Emergency Management (EM) and Information Systems (IS). Based on responses to an online survey from 111 respondents from 19 countries who were mainly identified through ISCRAM (Information Systems for Crisis Response and Management), all ten courses described for all EM master's programs are considered important, as are all ten courses for an EM degree program with an IS focus. The two top-rated IS courses for such programs are Social Media for EM and Decision Support Systems for EM. Differences in opinions related to respondent characteristics such as nationality, educational level, and roles (academics vs. practitioners) are described, and suggestions for future expansion of this research suggested.","authors":["Linda Plotnick","Murray Turoff","Starr Roxanne Hiltz","Lili Yang"],"meta":["May 2015","Conference: 13th International Conference on Information Systems for Crisis Response and ManagementAt: Rio de Janeiro","Project: Development of Curriculum Guidelines by the ISCRAM Education Committee"],"references":["277940297_Enhancing_post-disaster_reconstruction_capacity_through_lifelong_learning_in_higher_education","275541320_The_Current_Landscape_of_Disaster_Resilience_Education_in_Europe","247935033_IS_2010_Curriculum_Guidelines_for_Undergraduate_Degree_Programs_in_Information_Systems","4909550_Curriculum_Guidelines_for_Bachelor_of_Science_Degrees_in_Statistical_Science","265100452_FROM_CHAOS_TO_CLARITY_EDUCATING_EMERGENCY_MANAGERS","249359160_Towards_the_Development_of_Standards_in_Emergency_Management_Training_and_Education","235319105_Training_emergency_managers_for_earthquake_response_Challenges_and_opportunities"]}
