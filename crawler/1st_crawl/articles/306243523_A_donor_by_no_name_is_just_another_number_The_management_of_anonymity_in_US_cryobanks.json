{"id":"306243523_A_donor_by_no_name_is_just_another_number_The_management_of_anonymity_in_US_cryobanks","abstract":"In this paper, I argue for a re-examination of the concept and application of donor anonymity. If computer sciences and genetic technologies have established that anonymity is impossible to ensure in current times, why does the fiction of anonymity continue to survive in cryobanks? I argue that the performance and management of ‘anonymity’ meet different needs of donors, recipients, and cryobanks. While absolute anonymity is neither possible nor preferable to cryobanks (as donor records may be needed for future medical and legal references), contractual anonymity gives the parties involved reassurance that the flow of information is under reliable control – in this case – the control of cryobanks. While complete protection of the donor’s private information is limited in actuality, it provides a certain freedom from an unforeseen and undetermined future by temporarily easing donor and recipient apprehensions about feared ‘what-if’ scenarios. In order to be useful, anonymity’s mechanics must incorporate enough flexibility to be undone if needed.","authors":["Ayeshah Emon"],"meta":["March 2017BioSocieties 12(1)","DOI:10.1057/s41292-016-0001-8"],"references":["352334635_Abolishing_Anonymity_A_Rights-Based_Approach_to_Evaluating_Anonymous_Sperm_Donation","344754975_Culturing_Life_How_Cells_Became_Technologies","331212148_Spare_Parts_Organ_Replacement_In_American_Society","324287302_The_Gift_The_Form_and_Reason_for_Exchange_in_Archaic_Societies","313195845_Genetic_privacy_Emerging_concepts_and_values","305389454_Institutional_Ecology_'Translations'_and_Boundary_Objects_Amateurs_and_Professionals_in_Berkeley's_Museum_of_Vertebrate_Zoology","301001825_INTRODUCTION_TO_THE_FIRST_EDITION","290153682_The_Gift_Relationship_From_Human_Blood_to_Social_Policy","287703256_Sperm_counts_Overcome_by_man's_most_precious_fluid","287635938_Anonymity_the_production_of_goods_and_institutional_design","286654457_Strange_harvest_Organ_transplants_denatured_bodies_and_the_transformed_self","284889872_International_and_comparative_concepts_of_privacy","279366669_Introduction_to_the_First_Edition","278058979_Interests_obligations_and_rights_of_the_donor_in_gamete_donation","274439349_The_Anonymity_Tool"]}
