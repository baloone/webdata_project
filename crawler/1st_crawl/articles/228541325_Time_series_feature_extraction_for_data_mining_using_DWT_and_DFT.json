{"id":"228541325_Time_series_feature_extraction_for_data_mining_using_DWT_and_DFT","abstract":"A new method of dimensionality reduction for time series data mining is proposed. Each time series is compressed with wavelet or Fourier decomposition. Instead of using only the first coefficients, a new method of choosing the best coefficients for a set of time series is presented. A criterion function is evaluated using all values of a co-efficient position to determine a good set of coefficients. The optimal criterion function with respect to energy preservation is given. For many real life data sets much more energy can be preserved, which is advantageous for data mining tasks. All time series to be mined, or at least a representative subset, need to be available a priori.","authors":["Fabian MÃ¶rchen"],"meta":["December 2003"],"references":["247916096_The_Integration_of_Neural_Networks_with_Symbolic_Knowledge_Processing","228771755_Pattern_discovery_from_stock_time_series_using_self-organizing_maps","228706090_Maps_for_the_visualization_of_high-dimensional_data_spaces","221633414_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","221475055_Learning_First_Order_Logic_Time_Series_Classifiers","220791703_Efficient_Similarity_Search_In_Sequence_Databases","3297158_Haar_Wavelets_for_Efficient_Similarity_Search_of_Time-Series_With_and_Without_Time_Warping","2935771_Distance_Measures_for_Effective_Clustering_of_ARIMA_Time-Series","2845566_When_Is_Nearest_Neighbor_Meaningful","2711795_Similarity-Based_Queries_for_Time_Series_Data","2623499_Efficient_Retrieval_of_Similar_Time_Sequences_Using_DFT","2612270_Fast_Similarity_Search_in_the_Presence_of_Noise_Scaling_and_Translation_in_Time-Series_Databases","2560280_A_Wavelet-Based_Anytime_Algorithm_for_K-Means_Clustering_of_Time_Series","2456367_Fast_Subsequence_Matching_in_Time-Series_Databases","2450513_Clustering_Time_Series_with_Hidden_Markov_Models_and_Dynamic_Time_Warping","290824136_Pattern_extraction_for_time_series_classification","242367092_The_r-tree_an_efficient_and_robust_method_for_points_and_rectangles","225198057_Kasetty_S_On_the_Need_for_Time_Series_Data_Mining_Benchmarks_A_Survey_and_Empirical_Demonstration_Data_Mining_and_Knowledge_Discovery_74_349-371","225092552_A_Wavelet_Tour_of_Signal_Processing","222515555_Efficient_Time-Series_Subsequence_Matching_using_Duality_in_Constructing_Windows","221598029_Clustering_of_streaming_time_series_is_meaningless","221322328_On_the_Surprising_Behavior_of_Distance_Metrics_in_High_Dimensional_Space","220688794_C45_Programs_for_Machine_Learning","3943317_Similarity_search_over_time-series_data_using_wavelets","3823804_Cluster_and_calendar_based_visualization_of_time_series_data","3792305_Efficient_time_series_matching_by_wavelets","2459832_A_Comparison_of_DFT_and_DWT_Based_Similarity_Search_in_Time-Series_Databases"]}
