{"id":"286159793_Identifying_princes_of_Sleeping_Beauty_-_Knowledge_mapping_in_discovering_princes","abstract":"Sleeping Beauty is a typical phenomenon of delayed recognition in scientific discovery. She was unnoticed for a long time, and suddenly found by researchers and cited a lot. This is known as waking-up Sleeping Beauty. The one who arouse the Sleeping Beauty is called prince. In order to discover the waking-up mechanism of Sleeping Beauty, we collect seven classic Sleeping Beauty's citing and cited data, and use co-citation cluster analysis method to analyze core citation circle in citation network by CITESPACE. At the same time, we take direct and indirect citations of the Sleeping Beauty into account to identify who was the true prince (he terminated the slumber of the Sleeping Beauty and made a significant contribution to the scientific development). It is a new approach to study the phenomenon of Sleeping Beauty even delayed recognition and identify waking-up mechanism.","authors":["li Shen","Guang Yu","Xue Zhang","Wan-feng Zhang"],"meta":["October 2014","DOI:10.1109/ICMSE.2014.6930325"],"references":["236001249_On_Sleeping_Beauties_Princes_and_other_tales_of_citation_distributions","226105663_Geometry_of_Random_Sequential_Adsorption","51679724_The_Mendel_syndrome_in_science_Durability_of_scientific_literature_and_its_effects_on_bibliometric_analysis_of_individual_scientists","46429834_Better_late_than_never_On_the_chance_to_become_highly_cited_only_beyond_the_standard_bibliometric_time_horizon","39375574_Editorial_and_publication_delay_of_papers_submitted_to_14_selected_Food_Research_journals_Influence_of_online_posting","2840010_Color_Constancy_A_Method_for_Recovering_Surface_Spectral_Reflectance","292706760_Would_Mendel's_work_have_been_ignored_if_the_Science_Citation_Index_was_available_100_years_ago","285106146_More_delayed_recognition_Part_2_From_inhibin_to_scanning_electron_microscopy","284884007_Premature_discovery_or_delayed_recognition_-_Why","284035573_Mendel's_Regel_uber_das_Verhalten_der_Nachkommenschaft_der_Rassenbastarde","281198768_Delayed_recognition_in_scientific_discovery_Citation_frequency_analysis_aids_the_search_for_case_histories","279616559_The_intra-prostatic_'partial_catheter'_Urological_spiralDER_INTRAPROSTATISCHE_'PARTIELLE_KATHETER'_UROLOGISCHE_SPIRALE","267256466_Experiments_in_Plant_Hybridization","247338080_Random_Sequential_Adsorption","241763600_The_myth_of_delayed_recognition","239781090_Why_and_how_can_sleeping_beauties_be_awakened","234326519_Mechanism_of_Yellow_Luminescence_in_GaN","227682577_Is_Scientific_Literature_Subject_to_a_'Sell-By-Date'_A_General_Methodology_to_Analyze_the_'Durability'_of_Scientific_Documents","223694748_Massive_N_2a_Supergravity_in_Ten_Dimensions","222755643_Buchsbaum_G_A_spatial_processor_model_for_object_colour_perception_Journal_of_the_Franklin_Institute_3101_1-26","222469335_Duality_of_type-II_7-branes_and_8-branes","222446473_Evidence_for_Heterotic-Type_I_String_Duality","220435233_Eponymy_and_Obliteration_by_Incorporation_The_Case_of_the_Nash_Equilibrium","220364702_Klaus_Fuchs_-_The_enduring_contribution_to_physics_from_his_British_period","37374845_A_sarcoma_of_the_fowl_transmissible_by_an_agent_separable_from_tumor_cells","20386099_The_Intraprostatic_Spiral_A_New_Device_for_Insertion_with_the_Patient_Under_Local_Anesthesia_and_with_Ultrasonic_Guidance_with_3_Months_of_Followup","19388565_Evaluation_of_linear_models_of_surface_spectral_reflectance_with_small_numbers_of_parameters","13311587_Optically_Detected_Magnetic_Resonance_of_GaN_Films_Grown_by_Organometallic_Chemical-Vapor_Deposition","13230492_Dirichlet_Branes_and_Ramond-Ramond_Charges","8758579_Pathogenic_Properties_and_Vertical_Transmission_of_the_Mouse_Leukemia_Agent"]}
