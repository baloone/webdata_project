{"id":"286374538_Multiplication_model_of_electron_multiplying_CCD_based_on_single_type_of_carrier","abstract":"The avalanche multiplication principle of electron multiplying CCD (EMCCD) was discussed based on single type of carrier, and a multiplication model was built by using a classic piecewise ionization rate model and avalanche multiplication integral formula. Wolff's ionization rate model was selected according to the structure and the multiplication gate voltage amplitude of the actual devices. By comparing the theoretical result with the multiplication curve of the actual device, it can be found that only enough fringing field and multiplication area can lead to an adequate signal multiplication. The relationship between the multiplication gate voltage and the total gain of the cascaded boosting EMCCD can be determined by using the model. The calculation indicates that the actual device multiplication curve agreed well with the one of EMCCD theory model.","authors":["C.-L.
