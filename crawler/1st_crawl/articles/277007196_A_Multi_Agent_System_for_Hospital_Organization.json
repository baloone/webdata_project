{"id":"277007196_A_Multi_Agent_System_for_Hospital_Organization","abstract":"In some countries the domain of medical care is characterized by difficulty, dynamism and diversity. In the 21st century healthcare represents different challenges (increasing cost of care, population growth and lack of caregivers). For that, cooperation in the Agent Technology can provide better healthcare than the traditional medical system. In fact, Intelligent Agents properties (sociability, proactivity, autonomy) and the features of Multi Agent Systems (management of distributed information, communication and cooperation between different entities) are a good option to solve several problems in the hospital organization. As examples of problems, which appear in the hospital, we cite: collaboration between hospital wards, elaborations of medical diagnostics, coordination among medical entities and the collection of information about patients etc. In this regard, we propose a new medical system called MMAS (Medical Multi- Agent System). The proposed system is complex; it integrates Multi-Agent System in healthcare in order to make care as efficient as possible.","authors":["Hanen Jemal","Zied Kechaou","Mounir Ben Ayed","Adel M.
