{"id":"317750720_General_Point_Sampling_with_Adaptive_Density_and_Correlations","abstract":"Analyzing and generating sampling patterns are fundamental problems for many applications in computer graphics. Ideally, point patterns should conform to the problem at hand with spatially adaptive density and correlations. Although there exist excellent algorithms that can generate point distributions with spatially adaptive density or anisotropy, the pair-wise correlation model, blue noise being the most common, is assumed to be constant throughout the space. Analogously, by relying on possibly modulated pair-wise difference vectors, the analysis methods are designed to study only such spatially constant correlations. In this paper, we present the first techniques to analyze and synthesize point patterns with adaptive density and correlations. This provides a comprehensive framework for understanding and utilizing general point sampling. Starting from fundamental measures from stochastic point processes, we propose an analysis framework for general distributions, and a novel synthesis algorithm that can generate point distributions with spatio-temporally adaptive density and correlations based on a locally stationary point process model. Our techniques also extend to general metric spaces. We illustrate the utility of the new techniques on the analysis and synthesis of real-world distributions, image reconstruction, spatio-temporal stippling, and geometry sampling. © 2017 The Author(s) Computer Graphics Forum © 2017 The Eurographics Association and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.
