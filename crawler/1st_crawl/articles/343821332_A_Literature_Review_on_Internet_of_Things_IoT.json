{"id":"343821332_A_Literature_Review_on_Internet_of_Things_IoT","abstract":"This paper offers a Human-computer interaction (HCI) point of view on the developing plan of the Internet of Things (IoT). The plan is to give insights and experiences as to how HCI could captivate beneficially with the IoT plan while it is in its developing stage. We analyzed and explored HCI-related writing and business results of the IoT, arranging a last gathering of 21 research papers. Through this, we have the capacity to give a depiction of the sorts, degree and foci of both research and business endeavors. It has additionally uncovered patterns and opportunities for how HCI could move ahead when captivating with the IoT. At last, this review gives the insights for HCI, recommending strategies and potential methodologies that can help guarantee a human-focused IoT.","authors":["Vedang Ratan Vatsa","Gopal Singh"],"meta":["August 2015"],"references":["262400239_SensorTune_a_Mobile_Auditory_Interface_for_DIY_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","262169394_Indoor_Weather_Stations_Investigating_a_ludic_approach_to_environmental_HCI_through_batch_prototyping","257458242_The_Internet_of_Things_Connecting_the_world","236874763_Swiss-Cheese_Extended_An_object_recognition_method_for_ubiquitous_interfaces_based_on_capacitive_proximity_sensing","221629488_Memory_rich_clothing_second_skins_that_communicate_physical_memory","262292463_The_Dubuque_Electricity_Portal_Evaluation_of_a_city-scale_residential_electricity_consumption_feedback_system","262167330_Approaching_a_human-centred_internet_of_things","257458066_Segmenting_sensor_data_for_activity_monitoring_in_smart_environments","239761302_Beyond_energy_monitors_Interaction_energy_and_emerging_energy_systems","237844944_A_Conversation_Between_Trees_What_Data_Feels_Like_In_The_Forest"]}
