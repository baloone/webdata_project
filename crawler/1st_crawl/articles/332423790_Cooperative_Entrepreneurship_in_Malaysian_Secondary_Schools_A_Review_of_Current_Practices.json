{"id":"332423790_Cooperative_Entrepreneurship_in_Malaysian_Secondary_Schools_A_Review_of_Current_Practices","abstract":"Cooperative entrepreneurship plays a significant role in the effort of developing future entrepreneurs. This type of entrepreneurship increases the economic and social interests of its members and brings substantial advantages to the community and society. Due to capital sharing and low risks in starting a business, cooperative entrepreneurship is a prominent way to generate job opportunities and reduce unemployment without depending on wage employment, especially among young people. In cultivating the entrepreneurial spirit, the Malaysian Ministry of Education (MOE) has introduced the school cooperatives since 1968, which aims to nurture entrepreneurial experiences and orientations among students. Hence, the primary purpose of this paper is to highlight the current practices of cooperative entrepreneurship in Malaysian secondary schools by reviewing the impact of the school cooperativesâ€™ activities in instilling entrepreneurial knowledge and motivation among the youth. This conceptual paper also aims to foster awareness into the importance of school cooperatives in the Malaysian entrepreneurship education.","authors":["Norliana Abd Majid","Fakhrul Anwar Zainol","Wan Norhayate","Asyraf Afthanorhan"],"meta":["April 2019","Project: Cooperative Entrepreneurship"],"references":["330204120_Entrepreneurial_Intention_from_the_Islamic_Perspective_A_Holistic_Approach","330069671_Scaling_up_social_innovation_for_sustainability_The_roles_of_social_enterprise_capabilities","320016557_Motivational_Factors_and_Students_Entrepreneurial_Intention_in_Pakistan","319562411_Perception_of_Tourism_Impact_and_Support_Tourism_Development_in_Terengganu_Malaysia","319324852_The_Effect_of_Entrepreneurship_Education_on_Entrepreneurial_Intention_Mediated_by_Motivation_and_Attitude_among_Management_Students_State_University_of_Malang_Indonesia","318876059_A_Conceptual_Analysis_on_Co-operative_Enterprise_KOSISWA_at_Institute_of_Higher_Learning_IHLs_in_Malaysia_Transformation_of_Malays_Economies_Agenda","318789369_The_Effect_of_Teacher's_Ability_and_Student's_Attitude_on_the_Subject_of_Craft_and_Entrepreneurship_to_the_Development_of_Entrepreneurship_Spirit_in_the_Implementation_of_Authentic_Problem_Based_Learn","316916910_The_assessment_of_the_performance_of_covariance-based_structural_equation_modeling_and_partial_least_square_path_modeling","319505700_Gerakan_Koperasi_Di_Malaysia_Peranan_dan_Strategi_Dalam_Pembangunan_Negara","316937502_Explaining_university_students'_career_path_intentions_from_their_current_entrepreneurial_exposure","312544198_Entrepreneurial_intention_among_science_technology_students_in_India_extending_the_theory_of_planned_behavior","312333574_Drivers_of_entrepreneurial_intentions_among_business_students_in_Macedonia","306259244_International_business_knowledge_of_entrepreneurs_in_Narathiwat_Thailand","314915169_A_Study_on_Impact_of_Motivational_Factors_on_the_Growth_of_Rural_Entrepreneurs_of_Assam","308255107_Student_involvement_A_developmental_theory_for_higher_education"]}
