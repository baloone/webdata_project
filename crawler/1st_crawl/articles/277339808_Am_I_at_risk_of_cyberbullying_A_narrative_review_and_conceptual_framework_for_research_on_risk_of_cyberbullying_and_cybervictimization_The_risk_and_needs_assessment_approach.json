Numerous studies have been conducted that address its prevalence, nature, possible impact and strategies to prevent cyberbullying (Patchin, 2013). Some recent papers have reviewed existing instruments designed to measure cyberbullying (Berne et al., 2012; Vivolo-Kantor, Martell, Holland &Westby, 2014), while others have reviewed risk factors (Kowalski et al. 2014).","authors":["Anna Costanza Baldry","David P.
