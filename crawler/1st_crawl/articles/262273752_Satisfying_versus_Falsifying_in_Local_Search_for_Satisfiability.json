{"id":"262273752_Satisfying_versus_Falsifying_in_Local_Search_for_Satisfiability","abstract":"During local search, clauses may frequently be satisfied or falsified. Modern SLS algorithms often exploit the falsifying history of clauses to select a variable to flip, together with variable properties such as score and age. The score of a variable x refers to the decrease in the number of unsatisfied clauses if x is flipped. The age of x refers to the number of steps done since the last time when x was flipped.","authors":["Chu-Min Li","yu li"],"meta":["June 2012","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-31612-8_43","Conference: Proceedings of the 15th international conference on Theory and Applications of Satisfiability Testing"],"references":["220944441_Diversification_and_Determinism_in_Local_Search_for_Satisfiability","2936124_An_Adaptive_Noise_Mechanism_for_WalkSAT","2928420_Evidence_for_Invariants_in_Local_Search","262253092_Exploiting_Historical_Relationships_of_Clauses_and_Variables_in_Local_Search_for_Satisfiability","220944388_Improving_Stochastic_Local_Search_for_SAT_with_a_New_Probability_Distribution"]}
