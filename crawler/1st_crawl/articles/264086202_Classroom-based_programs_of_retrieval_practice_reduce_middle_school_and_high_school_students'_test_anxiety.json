{"id":"264086202_Classroom-based_programs_of_retrieval_practice_reduce_middle_school_and_high_school_students'_test_anxiety","abstract":"When retrieval practice is applied in classroom settings, do K-12 students experience changes in test anxiety? To answer this question frequently asked by educators, we surveyed 1,408 middle school and high school students about their study strategy preferences and their reactions to a classroom-based program of retrieval practice. Our data suggest that for classes in which retrieval practice occurred, 92% of students reported that retrieval practice helped them learn and 72% reported that retrieval practice made them less nervous for unit tests and exams. This study is the first to examine the relationship between retrieval practice and classroom test anxiety, and self-reported study strategy use in pre-college students. In light of our results, we encourage K-12 teachers to use retrieval practice in their classrooms to reduce test anxiety and improve learning.","authors":["Pooja K.
