{"id":"337369700_Deep_Guided_Learning_for_Fast_Multi-Exposure_Image_Fusion","abstract":"We propose a fast multi-exposure image fusion (MEF) method, namely MEF-Net, for static image sequences of arbitrary spatial resolution and exposure number. We first feed a low-resolution version of the input sequence to a fully convolutional network for weight map prediction. We then jointly upsample the weight maps using a guided filter. The final image is computed by a weighted fusion. Unlike conventional MEF methods, MEF-Net is trained end-to-end by optimizing the perceptually calibrated MEF structural similarity (MEF-SSIM) index over a database of training sequences at full resolution. Across an independent set of test sequences, we find that the optimized MEF-Net achieves consistent improvement in visual quality for most sequences, and runs 10 to 1000 times faster than state-of-the-art methods. The code is made publicly available at.","authors":["Kede Ma","Zhengfang Duanmu","Hanwei Zhu","Yuming Fang"],"meta":["November 2019IEEE Transactions on Image Processing PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TIP.2019.2952716"],"references":["323796674_Fast_End-to-End_Trainable_Guided_Filter","322515727_Learning_a_Deep_Single_Image_Contrast_Enhancer_from_Multi-Exposure_Images","321963173_DeepFuse_A_Deep_Unsupervised_Approach_for_Exposure_Fusion_with_Extreme_Exposure_Image_Pairs","321231998_Deep_reverse_tone_mapping","319566093_Multi-scale_exposure_fusion_via_gradient_domain_guided_image_filtering","313873079_Robust_Multi-Exposure_Image_Fusion_A_Structural_Patch_Decomposition_Approach","311430683_Local_Blur_Mapping_Exploiting_High-Level_Semantics_by_Deep_Neural_Networks","305683206_Instance_Normalization_The_Missing_Ingredient_for_Fast_Stylization","302305068_Multi-Scale_Context_Aggregation_by_Dilated_Convolutions","286098929_Perceptual_evaluation_of_multi-exposure_image_fusion_algorithms","278040014_Perceptual_Quality_Assessment_for_Multi-Exposure_Image_Fusion","236228168_Guided_Image_Filtering","235392779_Image_Fusion_With_Guided_Filtering","222648347_Image_Registration_Methods_A_Survey","220721981_Fast_bilateral_filtering_for_the_display_of_high-dynamic-range_images","220184290_Edge-preserving_decompositions_for_multi-scale_tone_and_detail_manipulation","220182366_Objective_Assessment_of_Multiresolution_Image_Fusion_Algorithms_for_Context_Enhancement_in_Night_Vision_A_Comparative_Study","3596479_Enhanced_image_capture_through_fusion","3327793_Image_Quality_Assessment_From_Error_Visibility_to_Structural_Similarity","335848767_Perceptual_Evaluation_for_Multi-Exposure_Image_Fusion_of_Dynamic_Scenes","329750426_Fast_End-to-End_Trainable_Guided_Filter","322060087_DeepFuse_A_Deep_Unsupervised_Approach_for_Exposure_Fusion_with_Extreme_Exposure_Image_Pairs","322058824_Fast_Image_Processing_with_Fully-Convolutional_Networks","321987159_Multi-Exposure_Image_Fusion_by_Optimizing_A_Structural_Similarity_Index","319866285_Evaluating_Multiexposure_Fusion_Using_Image_Information","319770368_Decoupling_algorithms_from_schedules_for_easy_optimization_of_image_processing_pipelines","319478086_Fast_Image_Processing_with_Fully-Convolutional_Networks","318611898_Deep_high_dynamic_range_imaging_of_dynamic_scenes","318337546_Deep_Bilateral_Learning_for_Real-Time_Image_Enhancement","311229546_Fast_local_Laplacian_filters_Theory_and_applications","309955462_Burst_photography_for_high_dynamic_range_and_low-light_imaging_on_mobile_cameras","308746581_Multi-exposure_image_fusion_A_patch-wise_approach","303404518_Pixel-level_image_fusion_A_survey_of_the_state_of_the_art","301921832_Fully_convolutional_networks_for_semantic_segmentation","290562353_The_HDR_photographic_survey","284579148_Multi-Scale_Context_Aggregation_by_Dilated_Convolutions","283776126_Transform_Recipes_for_Efficient_Cloud_Photo_Enhancement","272194743_Batch_Normalization_Accelerating_Deep_Network_Training_by_Reducing_Internal_Covariate_Shift","269935079_Adam_A_Method_for_Stochastic_Optimization","229805949_Exposure_Fusion_A_Simple_and_Practical_Alternative_to_High_Dynamic_Range_Photography","229155690_Detail-Enhanced_Exposure_Fusion","224733267_The_Laplacian_Pyramid_as_a_Compact_Image_Code","222681366_Fusion_of_multi-exposure_images","220184523_Real-time_edge-aware_image_processing_with_the_bilateral_grid","220183537_Fast_median_and_bilateral_filtering","215458823_High_dynamic_range_imaging_acquisition_display_and_image-based_lighting","51686556_Gradient-Directed_Multiexposure_Composition","30012539_Joint_Bilateral_Upsampling"]}
