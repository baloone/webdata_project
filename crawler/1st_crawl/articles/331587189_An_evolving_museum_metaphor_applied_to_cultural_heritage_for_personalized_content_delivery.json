{"id":"331587189_An_evolving_museum_metaphor_applied_to_cultural_heritage_for_personalized_content_delivery","abstract":"The aim of this article concerns adaptive and personalized navigation in a cultural heritage database. The theoretical grounding of the proposition relies on cognitive science, particularly constructivism and enaction. The navigation is conducted via an intelligent interface through a 3D “living” museum metaphor. The purpose of this interface is to recommend dynamic cultural heritage objects according to a user profile that is computed online from the interactions that a user has with these objects. To this end, objects are linked to semantic structures that represent relations between cultural heritage concepts. The user profile is described in terms of cultural heritage interests. A prototype of this principle is used to evaluate some of the basic hypotheses of this proposition.","authors":["Landy Rajaonarivo","Eric Maisel","Pierre De Loor"],"meta":["March 2019User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction 29(1)","DOI:10.1007/s11257-019-09222-x"],"references":["322371625_A_Practical_Approach_to_Measuring_User_Engagement_with_the_Refined_User_Engagement_Scale_UES_and_New_UES_Short_Form","313220281_Evaluation_of_Internal_and_External_Validity_of_a_Virtual_Environment_for_Learning_a_Long_Procedure","282356955_Visual_Metaphors_for_Semantic_Cultural_Heritage","280640341_Big_Data_Visualisation_in_Immersive_Virtual_Reality_Environments_Embodied_Phenomenological_Perspectives_to_Interaction","269610816_Adaptive_Virtual_Exhibitions","313102322_Verbs_semantics_and_lexical_selection","312015012_Aemoo_Linked_Data_exploration_based_on_Knowledge_Patterns","311488544_Beyond_Relevance_Adapting_ExplorationExploitation_in_Information_Retrieval","279838097_Storychastics_a_Bayesian_network_architecture_for_combined_user_modeling_sensor_fusion_and_computational_storytelling_for_interactive_spaces","277901654_Topic-Oriented_Exploratory_Search_Based_on_an_Indexing_Network","267515366_Immersive_and_Collaborative_Data_Visualization_Using_Virtual_Reality_Platforms","265887379_Content-Based_Navigation_Within_Virtual_Museums","263859103_SimilarityExplorer_A_Visual_Inter-Comparison_Tool_for_Multifaceted_Climate_Data","262399380_Navigating_tomorrow's_web_From_searching_and_browsing_to_visual_exploration","262395662_The_WebBook_and_the_Web_Forager_An_information_workspace_for_the_World-Wide_Web"]}
