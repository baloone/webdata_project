{"id":"290263828_Improper_Twin_Edge_Coloring_of_Graphs","abstract":"Let $G$ be a graph whose each component has order at least 3. Let $s : E(G)\n\\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}_k$ for some integer $k\\geq 2$ be an improper edge\ncoloring of $G$ (where adjacent edges may be assigned the same color). If the\ninduced vertex coloring $c : V (G) \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}_k$ defined by $c(v) =\n\\sum_{e\\in E_v} s(e) \\mbox{ in } \\mathbb{Z}_k,$ (where the indicated sum is\ncomputed in $\\mathbb{Z}_k$ and $E_v$ denotes the set of all edges incident to\n$v$) results in a proper vertex coloring of $G$, then we refer to such a\ncoloring as an improper twin $k$-edge coloring. The minimum $k$ for which $G$\nhas an improper twin $k$-edge coloring is called the improper twin chromatic\nindex of $G$ and is denoted by $\\chi'_{it}(G)$.\nIn this paper, we show that if $G$ is a graph with vertex chromatic number\n$\\chi(G)$, then $\\chi'_{it}(G)=\\chi(G)$, unless $\\chi(G)=2 \\pmod 4$ and in this\ncase $\\chi'_{it}(G)\\in \\{\\chi(G), \\chi(G)+1\\}$. Moreover, we show that it is\nNP-hard to decide whether $\\chi'_{it}(G)=\\chi(G)$ or $\\chi'_{it}(G)=\\chi(G)+1$\nand give some examples of perfect graph classes for which the problem is\npolynomial.","authors":["Paniz Abedin","Saieed Akbari","Mahsa Daneshmand","Marc Demange"],"meta":["July 2017Graphs and Combinatorics 33(4)","DOI:10.1007/s00373-017-1782-7","SourcearXiv","Project: Theoretical computer science"],"references":["267654694_On_Twin_Edge_Colorings_of_Graphs","257406608_Neighbor_Sum_Distinguishing_Index","328900446_Chromatic_graph_theory","321499538_Color-Induced_Graph_Colorings","267167255_On_modular_chromatic_indexes_of_graphs","267118093_Chromatic_Graph_Theory","267053499_Modular_neighbor-distinguishing_edge_colorings_of_graphs","265435621_Algorithm_Graph_Theory_and_Perfect_Graphs","242793334_Edge_weights_and_vertex_colors","239536756_The_Solution_of_the_Four-Color-Map_Problem","233730705_The_1-2-3_Conjecture_and_related_problems_a_survey","224943815_Group_Irregularity_Strength_of_Connected_Graphs","228057735_Computers_And_Intractability_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness","226258132_On_Colouring_the_Nodes_of_a_Network","224943818_Group_Sum_Chromatic_Number_of_Graphs"]}
