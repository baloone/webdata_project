{"id":"278721212_Saving_weak_programming_students_Applying_constructivism_in_a_first_programming_course","abstract":"The Perform approach aims to improve the success rate of weak students in a first programming course. The approach, based on constructivism, takes a tight control on the mental model construction process in the weak students, and allows the students to navigate through many conceptual pitfalls in programming fundamentals. The paper covers a discussion of applying constructivism in programming, exposes common hazards in the learning process, illustrates \nwhy weak students are weak, and then suggests several guidelines that can help the weak \nstudents to attain at least foundation level programming. The paper ends with a summary of our experiences in the effect of the Perform approach.","authors":["Andrew Lui","Reggie Kwan","Maria Poon","Yannie H. Y.
