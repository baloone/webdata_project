{"id":"342832764_Optimal_Slack_Stealing_Servicing_for_Real-Time_Energy_Harvesting_Systems","abstract":"We consider the problem of real-time scheduling in uniprocessor devices powered by energy harvesters. In particular, we focus on mixed sets of tasks with time and energy constraints: hard deadline periodic tasks and soft aperiodic tasks without deadlines. We present an optimal aperiodic servicing algorithm that minimizes the response times of aperiodic tasks without compromising the schedulability of hard deadline periodic tasks. The server, called Slack Stealing with energy Preserving (SSP), is designed based on a slack stealing mechanism that profits whenever possible from available spare processing time and energy. We analytically establish the optimality of SSP. Our simulation results validate our theoretical analysis.","authors":["Rola El Osta","Maryline Chetto","Hussein El Ghor"],"meta":["July 2020The Computer Journal 63(10)","DOI:10.1093/comjnl/bxaa047"],"references":["264387596_Optimal_Scheduling_for_Real-Time_Jobs_in_Energy_Harvesting_Computing_Systems","258165543_Clairvoyance_and_Online_Scheduling_in_Real-Time_Energy_Harvesting_Systems","329061148_Precise_Power_Capping_for_Latency-Sensitive_Applications_in_Datacenter","312853370_Power_management_in_energy_harvesting_sensor_networks","312566493_JouleMR_Towards_Cost-Effective_and_Green-Aware_Data_Processing_Frameworks","273181849_AppATP_An_Energy_Conserving_Adaptive_Mobile-Cloud_Transmission_Protocol","261060186_eTime_Energy-Efficient_Transmission_between_Cloud_and_Mobile_Devices","260720305_Harnessing_Renewable_Energy_in_Cloud_Datacenters_Opportunities_and_Challenges","260656454_Gearing_Resource-poor_Mobile_Devices_with_Powerful_Clouds_Architectures_Challenges_and_Applications","238680363_Hard_Real-Time_Computing_Systems"]}
