{"id":"272114438_The_Research_of_Speech_Recognition_in_Low_SNR_Based_on_GA-SVM","abstract":"To improve recognizing rate and recognizing efficiency, the algorithm of double-threshold is adopted in the endpoint detection, Mel-frequency Spectral Coefficients is obtained as speech characteristic parameters, the SVM parameters, penalty factor and kernel function parameter, were optimized with genetic algorithm, then, an speech recognition model was established with GA-SVM method. The improved algorithm was simulated by matlab, the experiment shows that this algorithm can achieved good results in isolated word speech recognition.","authors":["Yong Qi Wang","Hui Zhang"],"meta":["June 2014Applied Mechanics and Materials 590:727-731","DOI:10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.590.727"],"references":["303254274_Introduction_to_statistical_learning_theory_and_support_vector_machines","4285330_Research_on_Traffic_Number_Recognition_Based_on_Neural_Network_and_Invariant_Moments"]}
