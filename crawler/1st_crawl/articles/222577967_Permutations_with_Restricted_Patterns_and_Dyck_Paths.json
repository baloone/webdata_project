{"id":"222577967_Permutations_with_Restricted_Patterns_and_Dyck_Paths","abstract":"We exhibit a bijection between 132-avoiding permutations and Dyck paths. Using this bijection, it is shown that all the recently discovered results on generating functions for 132-avoiding permutations with a given number of occurrences of the pattern 12…k follow directly from old results on the enumeration of Motzkin paths, among which is a continued fraction result due to Flajolet. As a bonus, we use these observations to derive further results and a precise asymptotic estimate for the number of 132-avoiding permutations of {1, 2, …, n} with exactly r occurrences of the pattern 12…k. Second, we exhibit a bijection between 123-avoiding permutations and Dyck paths. When combined with a result of Roblet and Viennot, this bijection allows us to express the generating function for 123-avoiding permutations with a given number of occurrences of the pattern (k − 1)(k − 2)…1k in the form of a continued fraction and to derive further results for these permutations.","authors":["Christian Krattenthaler"],"meta":["March 2000Advances in Applied Mathematics 27(2-3):510-530","DOI:10.1006/aama.2001.0747","SourcearXiv"],"references":["2504135_Permutations_Containing_and_Avoiding_123_and_132_Patterns","2142099_Patterns_and_Fractions","268243410_Simple_Random_Walk_Statistics_Part_I_Discrete_Time_Results","266403994_Simple_Random_Walk_Statistics_Part_II_Continuous_Time_Results","265445639_Restricted_Permutations","246076812_Enumerative_combinatorics_Vol_I","240371941_Une_th_eorie_combinatoire_des_polynomes_orthogonaux_g_en_eraux","230801499_Restricted_Permutations_Continued_Fractions_and_Chebyshev_Polynomials","222472671_Restricted_permutations","222460801_Generating_trees_and_the_Catalan_and_Schrder_numbers","222454041_Combinatorial_Aspects_of_Continued_Fractions","222306943_Forbidden_subsequences_and_Chebyshev_polynomials","220194665_Theorie_combinatoire_des_T-fractions_et_approximants_de_Pade_en_deux_points","216546039_Enumerative_Combinatorics","2551277_Some_Combinatorial_Properties_of_Schubert_Polynomials","2351360_Asymptotic_Enumeration_Methods","2094903_Continued_Fractions_and_Catalan_Problems"]}
