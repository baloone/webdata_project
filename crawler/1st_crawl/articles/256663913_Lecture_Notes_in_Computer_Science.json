{"id":"256663913_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","abstract":"The de Bruijn graph data structure is widely used in next-generation sequencing (NGS). Many programs, e.g. de novo assemblers, rely on in-memory representation of this graph. However, current techniques for representing the de Bruijn graph of a human genome require a large amount of memory (Â¿ 30 GB).\nWe propose a new encoding of the de Bruijn graph, which occupies an order of magnitude less space than current representations. The encoding is based on a Bloom filter, with an additional structure to remove critical false positives.\nAn assembly software implementing this structure, Minia, performed a complete de novo assembly of human genome short reads using 5.7 GB of memory in 23 hours.","authors":["Rayan Chikhi","Guillaume Rizk"],"meta":["September 2013Algorithms for Molecular Biology 8(1):22","DOI:10.1186/1748-7188-8-22","SourcePubMed"],"references":["262273032_Succinct_de_Bruijn_Graphs","256838286_Correlation_of_Stroke_Volume_Measurement_between_Sonosite_Portable_Echocardiogram_and_Edwards_Flotrac_Sensor-Vigileo_Monitor_in_an_Intensive_Care_Unit","230589068_Scaling_metagenome_sequence_assembly_with_probabilistic_de_Bruijn_graphs","226884457_Less_Hashing_Same_Performance_Building_a_Better_Bloom_Filter","224868956_Exploiting_sparseness_in_de_novo_genome_assembly","224868949_KISSPLICE_de-novo_calling_alternative_splicing_events_from_RNA-seq_data","285536578_Proceedings_of_the_Seventeenth_Annual_ACM-SIAM_Symposium_on_Discrete_Algorithms_Preface","242070708_Text_Processing_and_Information_Retrieval","234158168_DSK_K-mer_counting_with_very_low_memory_usage","227761150_Less_hashing_same_performance_Building_a_better_Bloom_filter"]}
