{"id":"222671193_A_Proof_Search_Specification_of_the_p-Calculus","abstract":"We present a meta-logic that contains a new quantifier ∇ (for encoding “generic judgments”) and inference rules for reasoning within fixed points of a given specification. We then specify the operational semantics and bisimulation relations for the finite π-calculus within this meta-logic. Since we restrict to the finite case, the ability of the meta-logic to reason within fixed points becomes a powerful and complete tool since simple proof search can compute this one fixed point. The ∇ quantifier helps with the delicate issues surrounding the scope of variables within π-calculus expressions and their executions (proofs). We shall illustrate several merits of the logical specifications we write: they are natural and declarative; they contain no side conditions concerning names of variables while maintaining a completely formal treatment of such variables; differences between late and open bisimulation relations are easy to see declaratively; and proof search involving the application of inference rules, unification, and backtracking can provide complete proof systems for both one-step transitions and for bisimulation.","authors":["Alwen Tiu","Dale Miller"],"meta":["September 2004Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science 138(1):79-101","DOI:10.1016/j.entcs.2005.05.006","SourceCiteSeer"],"references":["313652855_Foundational_aspects_of_syntax","266728888_The_p-calculus_in_FM","266425464_The_p-Calculus_A_Theory_of_Mobile_Processes","244956247_A_full_formalisation_of_pi-calculus_theory_in_the_Calculus_of_Constructions","243615654_A_fixpoint_theorem_in_linear_logic","242914081_A_theory_of_bisimulation_for_the_p-calculus","239557390_A_unification_algorithm_for_typed_-calculus","238766985_Investigations_into_Logical_Deduction_II","234830547_Higher-order_abstract_syntax","226783247_System_Description_Twelf_-_A_Meta-Logical_Framework_for_Deductive_Systems"]}
