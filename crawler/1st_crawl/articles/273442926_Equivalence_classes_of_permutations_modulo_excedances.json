{"id":"273442926_Equivalence_classes_of_permutations_modulo_excedances","abstract":"We introduce a new equivalence relation on permutations where two permutations are equivalent if and only if they coincide on their excedance sets. This paper studies equivalence classes for several subsets of permutations. Enumerating results are presented for permutations , cycles and permutations avoiding one or two patterns of length three. Also, an open question are proposed.","authors":["Jean-Luc Baril","Toufik Mansour","Armen Petrossiana"],"meta":["December 2014Journal of Combinatorics 5(4):453--469","DOI:10.4310/JOC.2014.v5.n4.a4"],"references":["280445715_The_On-Line_Encyclopedia_of_Integer_Sequences","319394668_The_On-Line_Encyclopedia_of_Integer_Sequences","279837792_Permutations_with_forbidden_subsequences_and_stack-sortable_permutations","268992235_Patterns_in_Permutations_and_Words","265445639_Restricted_Permutations","260264043_The_Hopf_algebras_of_symmetric_functions_and_quasisymmetric_functions_in_non-commutative_variables_are_free_and_cofree","246076812_Enumerative_combinatorics_Vol_I","243127561_The_Hopf_algebras_of_symmetric_functions_and_quasisymmetric_functions_in_non-commutative_variables_are_free_and_cofree","239595553_Combinatorics_of_compositions_and_words_Discrete_Mathematics_and_its_Applications_Boca_Raton","230801367_Restricted_132-Avoiding_Permutations"]}
