{"id":"249623421_Expectations_and_the_Emergence_of_Nanotechnology","abstract":"Although nanotechnology is often defined as operations on the 10â€“9 meters,\nthe lack of charisma in the scale-bound definitions has been fortified by\nremarkable dreams and alluring promises that spark excitement for nanotechnology.\nThe story of the rhetorical development of nanotechnology\nreveals how speculative claims are powerful constructions that create legitimacy\nin this emerging technological domain. From its inception, nanotechnology\nhas been more of a dream than reality, more fiction than fact. In recent\nyears, however, the term nanotechnology has been actively drawn toward the\npresent to begin to deliver on the fantastic expectations. This debate over time\nand timing is loaded with paradox. This work examines how future claims\nwork to define what counts as nanotechnology and reveals dilemmas that\naccompany temporal disjunctures. Science and politics converge in debates\nabout the future of technology as expectations serve to create and enforce\npower and legitimacy in the emerging area.","authors":["Cynthia Selin"],"meta":["March 2007Science, Technology & Human Values 32(2):196-220","DOI:10.1177/0162243906296918"],"references":["261948476_Opening_Pandora's_Box_A_Sociological_Analysis_of_Scientists'_Discourse","333026320_Laboratory_Life_The_Construction_of_Scientific_Facts","320181990_Simians_Cyborgs_and_Women_The_Reinvention_of_Nature","313596747_Some_elements_of_a_sociology_of_translation_Domestication_of_the_scallops_and_the_fishermen_of_St_Brieuc_Bay","312466190_Some_elements_of_a_sociology_of_translation_domestication_of_the_scallops_and_the_fishermen_of_St_Brieuc_Bay_Power_action_and_belief","306199920_Nanotechnologies_nanoscience_and_opportunities_and_uncertainties","297463405_The_drugs_don't_work_Expectations_and_the_shaping_of_pharmacogenetics_vol_33_pg_3_2003","291153794_Little_big_science","267553518_National_Nanotechnology_Investment_in_the_FY_2004_Budget_Request","263179394_In_Search_of_Genotype_A_Content_Analysis_of_Biotechnology_Company_Documents"]}
