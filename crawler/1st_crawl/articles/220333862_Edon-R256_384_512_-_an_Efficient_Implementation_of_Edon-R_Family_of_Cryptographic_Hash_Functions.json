{"id":"220333862_Edon-R256_384_512_-_an_Efficient_Implementation_of_Edon-R_Family_of_Cryptographic_Hash_Functions","abstract":"We have designed three fast implementations of recently proposed family of hash func- tions Edon{R. They produce message digests of length 256, 384 and 512 bits. We have deflned huge quasigroups of orders 2256, 2384 and 2512 by using only bitwise operations on 32 bit values (additions modulo 232, XORs and left rotations) and achieved processing speeds of the Reference C code of 16.18 cycles/byte, 24.37 cycles/byte and 32.18 cycles/byte on x86 (Intel and AMD microprocessors). In this paper we give their full description, as well as an initial security analysis.","authors":["Danilo Gligoroski","Svein Johan Knapskog"],"meta":["January 2007","SourceDBLP"],"references":["244441629_Secret_sharing_schemes_arising_from_Latin_squares","226671358_Collision_Free_Hash_Functions_and_Public_Key_Signature_Schemes","225159884_Markov_Ciphers_and_Differential_Cryptanalysis","221355367_Merkle-Damgrd_Revisited_How_to_Construct_a_Hash_Function","216824694_On_the_Additive_Differential_Probability_of_Exclusive-Or","37442914_Black_box_cryptanalysis_of_hash_networks_based_on_multipermutations","2558433_Quasigroup_String_Processing","247320740_Quasigroup_String_Processing_Part_2","239066166_Osnovi_teorii_kvazigrup_i_lup","227328607_Efficient_Algorithms_for_Computing_Differential_Properties_of_Addition","226187449_Differential_Cryptanalysis_Mod_232_with_Applications_to_MD5","221354688_Multicollisions_in_Iterated_Hash_Functions_Application_to_Cascaded_Constructions","220342697_Latin_Squares_of_Order_10","220336783_Second_Preimages_on_n-bit_Hash_Functions_for_Much_Less_than_2n_Work","220190189_A_new_authentication_scheme_based_on_latin_squares","13771413_Communication_theory_of_secrecy_systems_1945","2945344_Design_Principles_for_Iterated_Hash_Functions"]}
