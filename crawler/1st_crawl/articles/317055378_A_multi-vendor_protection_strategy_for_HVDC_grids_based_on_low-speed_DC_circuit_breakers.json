{"id":"317055378_A_multi-vendor_protection_strategy_for_HVDC_grids_based_on_low-speed_DC_circuit_breakers","abstract":"A protection strategy for Multi-terminal HVDC (MTDC) \ngrids based on AC/DC converters without fault handling \ncapability such as half-bridge MMC converters is presented in \nthis paper. The key components of the proposed strategy \nconsist of DC breakers located at each converter station DC \nside and at each transmission line (overhead line or cable) \nend, all of them based on low-speed mechanical DC breaker \ntechnology with no fault current limiting devices. The \nprimary protection sequence includes steps of fault detection, \nAC sources contribution suppression, faulty transmission line \ndiscrimination and isolation, and power flow restoration. A \nback-up sequence is also proposed in case of breaker \noperation failure which is able to be performed in the same \ntime duration than the primary protection sequence. The \ndesign requirements of the DC breakers have been verified \nand are consistent with both the primary and back-up \nsequences. The concept of the proposed strategy and its \nassociated key components are described in the paper and \nvalidated by off-line simulations performed in EMTP-RV Â® .","authors":["D.S.
