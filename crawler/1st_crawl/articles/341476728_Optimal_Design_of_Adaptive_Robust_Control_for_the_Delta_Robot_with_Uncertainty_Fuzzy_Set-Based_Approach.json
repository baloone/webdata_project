{"id":"341476728_Optimal_Design_of_Adaptive_Robust_Control_for_the_Delta_Robot_with_Uncertainty_Fuzzy_Set-Based_Approach","abstract":"An optimal control design for the uncertain Delta robot is proposed in the paper. The uncertain factors of the Delta robot include the unknown dynamic parameters, the residual vibration disturbances and the nonlinear joints friction, which are (possibly fast) time-varying and bounded. A fuzzy set theoretic approach is creatively used to describe the system uncertainty. With the fuzzily depicted uncertainty, an adaptive robust control, based on the fuzzy dynamic model, is established. It designs an adaptation mechanism, consisting of the leakage term and the dead-zone, to estimate the uncertainty information. An optimal design is constructed for the Delta robot and solved by minimizing a fuzzy set-based performance index. Unlike the traditional fuzzy control methods (if-then rules-based), the proposed control scheme is deterministic and fuzzily optimized. It is proven that the global solution in the closed form for this optimal design always exists and is unique. This research provides the Delta parallel robot a novel optimal control to guarantee the system performance regardless of the uncertainty. The effectiveness of the proposed control is illustrated by a series of simulation experiments. The results reveal that the further applications in other robots are feasible.","authors":["Linlin Wu","Ruiying Zhao","Yuyu Li","Ye-Hwa Chen"],"meta":["May 2020Applied Sciences 10(10):3472","DOI:10.3390/app10103472"],"references":["339591999_Impact_of_Aging_and_Cognitive_Mechanisms_on_High-Speed_Motor_Activation_Patterns_Evidence_From_an_Orthoptera-Robot_Interaction","336823448_A_New_Adaptive_Fuzzy_PID_Controller_Based_on_Riccati-Like_Equation_with_Application_to_Vibration_Control_of_Vehicle_Seat_Suspension","336809766_Quintic_Pythagorean-Hodograph_Curves_Based_Trajectory_Planning_for_Delta_Robot_with_a_Prescribed_Geometrical_Constraint","333049011_Research_on_the_Motion_Error_Analysis_and_Compensation_Strategy_of_the_Delta_Robot","332017173_Development_and_Control_of_a_Pneumatic-Actuator_3-DOF_Translational_Parallel_Manipulator_with_Robot_Vision","325276432_Fractional_order_PID_for_tracking_control_of_a_parallel_robotic_manipulator_type_delta","324722074_Intelligent_Fault_Diagnosis_of_Delta_3D_Printers_Using_Attitude_Sensors_Based_on_Support_Vector_Machines","323968247_The_closed-form_motion_equation_of_redundant_actuation_parallel_robot_with_joint_friction_an_application_of_the_Udwadia-Kalaba_approach","330590903_Optimal_Robust_Position_Control_With_Input_Shaping_for_Flexible_Solar_Array_Drive_System_A_Fuzzy-Set_Theoretic_Approach","327872411_Robust_trajectory_tracking_control_for_uncertain_mechanical_systems_servo_constraint-following_and_adaptation_mechanism"]}
