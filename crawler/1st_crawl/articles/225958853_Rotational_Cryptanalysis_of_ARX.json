{"id":"225958853_Rotational_Cryptanalysis_of_ARX","abstract":"In this paper we analyze the security of systems based on modular additions, rotations, and XORs (ARX systems). We provide\nboth theoretical support for their security and practical cryptanalysis of real ARX primitives. We use a technique called\nrotational cryptanalysis, that is universal for the ARX systems and is quite efficient. We illustrate the method with the best known attack on reduced\nversions of the block cipher Threefish (the core of Skein). Additionally, we prove that ARX with constants are functionally\ncomplete, i.e. any function can be realized with these operations.\n\nKeywordsARX-cryptanalysis-rotational cryptanalysis","authors":["Dmitry Khovratovich","Ivica NikoliÄ‡"],"meta":["June 2010","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-13858-4_19","Sourcedx.doi.org","Conference: Proceedings of the 17th international conference on Fast software encryption"],"references":["226286430_Improved_Related-Key_Boomerang_Attacks_on_Round-Reduced_Threefish-512","225230142_How_to_Break_MD5_and_Other_Hash_Functions","225150051_SEA_A_Scalable_Encryption_Algorithm_for_Small_Embedded_Applications","313394464_Finding_SHA-1_characteristics_General_results_and_applications","256484410_Private_communication","240032388_Hongbo_Yu_How_to_Break_MD5_and_Other_Hash_Functions","237121704_Observations_on_the_Shabal_keyed_permutation","228362550_Sha-3_proposal_blake","228337570_CubeHash_specification_2_B_1","225700131_Solving_Systems_of_Differential_Equations_of_Addition"]}
