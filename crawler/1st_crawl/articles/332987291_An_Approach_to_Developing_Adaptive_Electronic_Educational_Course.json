{"id":"332987291_An_Approach_to_Developing_Adaptive_Electronic_Educational_Course","abstract":"Modern information and telecommunication technologies allow not only to provide information required for training students in electronic form, they promote changes in educational process. The electronic information educational environment provides the necessary mechanism for implementing studentâ€™s individual trajectories of training. Depending on his or her learning progress the process can vary from basic to intensive, with changes in volumes of information provided. One of the approaches to developing an adaptive electronic educational course is described in this paper. The tree of concepts mastered by students is considered as a basis for knowledge component organization. The tree of concepts will allow not only to organize theoretical material of the course in the form of the separate blocks of educational information intended for studying but also to determine a necessary and sufficient set of questions for testing students.","authors":["Roman Tsarev","Tatiana Nikolaevna Yamskikh","I.
