Many factors contribute to the process of decision selection and most all managerial decisions are based on forecasting. This study focuses on forecasting range results in order to assist in the selection decision process in regards to crime prevention. We use time series data on crime for the forecasting process, the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model for the forecasting method, and the Fuzzy Alpha Cut (FAC) technique to improve the forecasting range results. However, the ARIMA model requires at least 50 historical data points to ascertain a good forecasting result. Historical data can be available for less than these minimum requirements, which may lead to less precise forecasting results and forecasting range results, thus affecting the accuracy of the decision. To overcome this problem, this study proposes using FAC to improve the forecasting range results that produced from ARIMA model. We show that the forecasting range results derived from this combined method are better.","authors":["Noor Maizura","Mohamad Noor","Astari Retnowardhani","Yaya Sudarya Triana"],"meta":["November 2013International Journal of Information Processing and Management 4(7):59-71"],"references":["256699755_Application_of_fuzzy_set_theory_to_evaluate_the_probability_of_failure_in_rock_slopes","228854877_Fuzzy_alpha-cut_vs_Monte_Carlo_techniques_in_assessing_uncertainty_in_model_parameters","287711963_Fuzzy_sets_information_and_control","287677041_A_dual_hybrid_forecasting_model_for_support_of_decision_making_in_healthcare_management","257403490_A_flexible_deterministic_stochastic_and_fuzzy_Data_Envelopment_Analysis_approach_for_supply_chain_risk_and_vendor_selection_problem_Simulation_analysis","254391448_Vagaries_of_the_Euro_an_Introduction_to_ARIMA_Modeling","253735622_Assessment_of_Crime_Forecasting_Accuracy_for_Deployment_of_Police1","251574884_The_practical_research_on_flood_risk_analysis_based_on_IIOSM_and_fuzzy_a-cut_technique","241152555_A_decision_support_system_for_the_reserve_bank_of_India_to_forecast_currency_requirements_at_currency_chests","235287603_Forecasting_The_Key_to_Managerial_Decision_Making"]}
