{"id":"246628719_Demonstration_of_the_interactive_Graph_Visualization_SystemdaVinci","abstract":"We present the graph visualization systemdaVinci, an interactive tool that can be used by arbitrary application programs as a user interface for graph data structures. Beside a novel automatic layout algorithm for graphs, daVinci offers many interactive facilities such as fine-tuning of a layout, abstractions and scaling operations. A bidirectional application interface is used for tool communication with a program that controls the graph structure.","authors":["Michael Fr√∂hlich","Mattias Werner"],"meta":["January 1995"],"references":[]}
