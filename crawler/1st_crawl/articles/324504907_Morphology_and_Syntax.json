{"id":"324504907_Morphology_and_Syntax","abstract":"The interaction between syntax and word formation has always been a battleground, on which many important linguistic wars have been fought. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, disagreements involving the nature of the Word Formation (WF) component and the Lexicon provided the background for the emergence of two radically different trends within generative grammar: that of Generative Semantics, on the one hand, and Lexicalism, on the other hand. At stake at the time was the appropriate constraining of the grammar, and whether an independent, listâ€”like lexicon is more or less costly than an xtremely powerful syntax, in which transformations could derive varying syntactic and morphological structures from unique semantic representations.","authors":["Hagit Borer"],"meta":["August 2017","DOI:10.1002/9781405166348.ch8","In book: The Handbook of Morphology (pp.149-190)"],"references":[]}
