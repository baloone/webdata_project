{"id":"314638800_Fault_Ascription_in_Concurrent_Systems","abstract":"Fault diagnosis is becoming increasingly important and difficult with the growing pervasiveness and complexity of computer systems. We propose in this paper a general semantic framework for fault ascription, a precise form of fault diagnosis that relies on counterfactual analysis for identifying necessary and sufficient causes of faults in component-based systems. Our framework relies on configuration structures to handle concurrent systems, partial and distributed observations in a uniform way. It defines basic conditions for a counterfactual analysis of necessary and sufficient causes, and it presents a refined analysis that conforms to our basic conditions while avoiding various infelicities.","authors":["Gregor GÃ¶ssler","Jean-Bernard Stefani"],"meta":["January 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-28766-9_6","Conference: International Symposium on Trustworthy Global Computing"],"references":["262235801_Contract-Based_Blame_Assignment_by_Trace_Analysis","256441521_Graded_Causation_and_Defaults","221147505_From_Probabilistic_Counterexamples_via_Causality_to_Fault_Trees","220673835_Explaining_counterexamples_using_causality","220643513_Error_explanation_with_distance_metrics","216813077_Introduction_to_Discrete_Event_Systems","29609186_Distributed_monitoring_of_concurrent_and_asynchronous_systems---extended_version","299725049_Necessary_Conditions_and_Sufficient_Conditions_for_Optimality","286227274_Blaming_in_component-based_real-time_systems","279754815_A_general_framework_for_blaming_in_component-based_systems","265352649_Causality_Models_reasoning_and_inference_second_edition","259159027_Overview_of_fault_diagnosis_methods_for_Discrete_Event_Systems","239019102_A_Theory_of_Conditionals","224602155_A_Survey_of_Fault_Detection_Isolation_and_Reconfiguration_Methods","222443254_A_Theory_of_Diagnosis_from_First_Principles","222397673_Configuration_Structures_Event_Structures_and_Petri_Nets","220487167_Causes_and_Explanations_A_Structural-Model_Approach_Part_I_Causes","220423035_Liability_Issues_in_Software_Engineering_The_use_of_formal_methods_to_reduce_legal_uncertainties","220248410_Unfolding-Based_Diagnosis_of_Systems_with_an_Evolving_Topology"]}
