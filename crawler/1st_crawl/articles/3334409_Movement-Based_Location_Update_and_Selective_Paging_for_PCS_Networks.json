{"id":"3334409_Movement-Based_Location_Update_and_Selective_Paging_for_PCS_Networks","abstract":"This paper introduces a mobility tracking mechanism that combines\na movement-based location update policy with a selective paging scheme.\nMovement-based location update is selected for its simplicity. It does\nnot require each mobile terminal to store information about the\narrangement and the distance relationship of all cells. In fact, each\nmobile terminal only keeps a counter of the number of cells visited. A\nlocation update is performed when this counter exceeds a predefined\nthreshold value. This scheme allows the dynamic selection of the\nmovement threshold on a per-user basis. This is desirable as different\nusers may have very different mobility patterns. Selective paging\nreduces the cost for locating a mobile terminal in the expense of an\nincrease in the paging delay. We propose a selective paging scheme which\nsignificantly decreases the location tracking cost under a small\nincrease in the allowable paging delay. We introduce an analytical model\nfor the proposed location tracking mechanism which captures the mobility\nand the incoming call arrival patterns of each mobile terminal.\nAnalytical results are provided to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of\nthe proposed scheme under various parameters","authors":["I.F.
