{"id":"322322694_MEA_and_DEE_as_additives_on_diesel_engine_using_waste_plastic_oil_diesel_blends","abstract":"Waste plastic oil (WPO) is a standout amongst the most promising alternative fuels for diesel in view of most of its properties similar to diesel. The challenges of waste management and increasing fuel crisis can be addressed while with the production of fuel from plastic wastes. This experimental investigation is an endeavour to supplant diesel at least by 50% with waste plastic oil alongside 2-methoxy ethyl acetate (MEA) and diethyl ether (DEE) as additives. Test fuels considered in this study are WPO, 50D50W (50%Diesel + 50%WPO), 50D40W10MEA (50%Diesel + 40%WPO + 10%MEA) and 50D40W10DEE (50%Diesel + 40%WPO + 10%DEE). The test results are compared with diesel. An increase in brake thermal efficiency and abatement in brake specific fuel consumption are seen with 50D40W10MEA, as well as reduction in hydro carbon, carbon monoxide and smoke emissions. 50D40W10DEE showed reduced NOx emission whereas 50D40W10MEA has almost no impact. Engine performance and emission characteristics under different loads for different test fuels are discussed.","authors":["Pappula Bridjesh","Pitchaipillai Periyasamy","Arani Vijayarao Krishna Chaitanya","Geetha N.K"],"meta":["January 2018Sustainable Environment Research 28(3)","DOI:10.1016/j.serj.2018.01.001"],"references":["312340445_Combustion_performance_and_emission_analysis_of_a_DI_diesel_engine_using_plastic_pyrolysis_oil","310816253_Study_of_recycling_Singapore_solid_waste_as_land_reclamation_filling_material","293636374_Performance_and_emission_characteristics_of_diesel_fuel_produced_from_waste_plastic_oil_obtained_by_catalytic_pyrolysis_of_waste_polypropylene","316770445_Hazardous_wastes_and_waste_generation_factors_for_plastic_products_manufacturing_industries_in_Turkey","309750836_Extraction_and_characterization_of_waste_plastic_oil_WPO_with_the_effect_of_n-butanol_addition_on_the_performance_and_emissions_of_a_DI_diesel_engine_fueled_with_WPOdiesel_blends","309280232_Experimental_evaluation_of_waste_plastic_oil_and_its_blends_on_a_single_cylinder_diesel_engine","301273921_An_investigation_on_the_effects_of_using_DEE_additive_in_a_DI_diesel_engine_fuelled_with_waste_plastic_oil","297898663_Investigation_on_performance_emission_and_combustion_characteristics_of_variable_compression_engine_fuelled_with_diesel_waste_plastics_oil_blends","297674652_A_study_on_synthesis_of_energy_fuel_from_waste_plastic_and_assessment_of_its_potential_as_an_alternative_fuel_for_diesel_engines","289685599_Synthesis_of_high-density_jet_fuel_from_plastics_via_catalytically_integral_processes"]}
