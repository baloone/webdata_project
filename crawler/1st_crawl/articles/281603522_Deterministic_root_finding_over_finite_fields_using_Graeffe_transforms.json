{"id":"281603522_Deterministic_root_finding_over_finite_fields_using_Graeffe_transforms","abstract":"We design new deterministic algorithms, based on Graeffe transforms, to compute all the roots of a polynomial which splits over a finite field F q . Our algorithms were designed to be particularly efficient in the case when the cardinality q − 1 of the multiplicative group of F q is smooth. Such fields are often used in practice because they support fast discrete Fourier transforms. We also present a new nearly optimal algorithm for computing characteristic polynomials of multiplication endomorphisms in finite field extensions. This algorithm allows for the efficient computation of Graeffe transforms of arbitrary orders.","authors":["Bruno Grenet","Joris van der Hoeven","Grégoire Lecerf"],"meta":["June 2016Applicable Algebra in Engineering Communication and Computing 27(3)","DOI:10.1007/s00200-015-0280-5"],"references":["281047881_Randomized_root_finding_over_finite_fields_using_tangent_Graeffe_transforms","273351466_Sparse_Polynomial_Interpolation_in_Practice","303491014_Searching_for_primitive_roots_in_finite_fields","303488324_Factoring_polynomials_over_large_finite_fields","284757891_Calcul_deterministe_des_racines_d'un_polynome_dans_un_corps_fini","282358637_p-adic_precision","267181807_A_Deterministic_Algorithm_for_Factorizing_Polynomials_of_Fq_X","266355835_Handbook_of_Finite_Fields","265821271_A_New_Algorithm_for_Factoring_Polynomials_Over_Finite_Fields","265443772_Galois_Groups_and_Factoring_Polynomials_over_Finite_Fields"]}
