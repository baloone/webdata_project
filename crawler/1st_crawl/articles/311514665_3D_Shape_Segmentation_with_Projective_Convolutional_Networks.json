{"id":"311514665_3D_Shape_Segmentation_with_Projective_Convolutional_Networks","abstract":"This paper introduces a deep architecture for segmenting 3D objects into their labeled semantic parts. Our architecture combines image-based Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) and surface-based Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) to yield coherent segmentations of 3D shapes. The image-based FCNs are used for efficient view-based reasoning about 3D object parts. Through a special projection layer, FCN outputs are effectively aggregated across multiple views and scales, then are projected onto the 3D object surfaces. Finally, a surface-based CRF combines the projected outputs with geometric consistency cues to yield coherent segmentations. The whole architecture (multi-view FCNs and CRF) is trained end-to-end. Our approach significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods in the currently largest segmentation benchmark (ShapeNet). Finally, we demonstrate promising segmentation results on noisy 3D shapes acquired from consumer-grade depth cameras.","authors":["Evangelos Kalogerakis","Melinos Averkiou","Subhransu Maji","Siddhartha Chaudhuri"],"meta":["December 2016","Project: 3D Shape Segmentation with Projective Convolutional Networks"],"references":["319769910_Efficient_piecewise_training_of_deep_structure_models_for_semantic_segmentation","319770420_Semantic_Image_Segmentation_with_Deep_Convolutional_Nets_and_Fully_Connected_CRFs","319770291_Very_Deep_Convolutional_Networks_for_Large-Scale_Image_Recognition","319770168_Fully_Convolutional_Networks_for_Semantic_Segmentation","316806966_Semantic_3D_Object_Maps_for_Everyday_Robot_Manipulation","314779251_A_probabilistic_model_for_component-based_shape_synthesis","314394519_Learning_3D_mesh_segmentation_and_labeling","313619815_Unsupervised_feature_learning_for_RGB-D_based_object_recognition","311610921_Volumetric_and_Multi-view_CNNs_for_Object_Classification_on_3D_Data","311610893_Efficient_Piecewise_Training_of_Deep_Structured_Models_for_Semantic_Segmentation"]}
