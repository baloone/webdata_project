{"id":"312544827_The_Future_of_the_Computing_Curriculum_How_the_Computing_Curriculum_Instills_Values_and_Subjectivity_in_Young_People","abstract":"In these early stages of implementation of the English computing curriculum policy reforms, there are uncertainties with regards to the intentions of computing to young people. To date, research regarding the English computing curriculum has been mostly concerned with the content of the curriculum, its delivery and surrounding pedagogy. In contrast this paper seeks to explore the underlying motivation and values embedded in the computing curriculum. We propose that this curriculum has been driven by the needs of industry and the economy. We use Schwartz’s values to examine how the teaching of computing has been primarily embedded within the value of self-enhancement. We conclude, that by looking at this context and the underlying value structure, we can reflect on the dramatic effects of the narrative and discourse around the content, delivery and purpose of teaching computing to young people. We propose the narratives of curriculum, influence pedagogy and this in turn, has a powerful impact on the young people’s view of themselves and the world we want to equip them to create.Keywords: computing curriculum, education research, subjectivity, computer science education, Schwartz’s values.","authors":["Benjamin S Wohl","Sophie Beck","Lynne Blair"],"meta":["January 2017International Journal of Computer Science Education in Schools 1(1):21","DOI:10.21585/ijcses.v1i1.8"],"references":["304380643_Universals_in_the_content_and_structure_of_values_Theory_and_empirical_tests_in_20_countries","277002308_Common_Cause_The_Case_for_Working_With_Our_Cultural_Values","273923206_A_framework_for_enhancing_the_social_good_in_computing_education_A_values_approach","261535755_What_schools_are_for_and_why","285212762_Discipline_and_Punish","277801419_Values_in_Technology_Approaches_to_Learning","277232099_Blurring_the_Boundaries_-_STEM_Education_and_Education_for_Sustainable_Development","274144746_Computing_in_Schools","273835517_Learning_to_labour_An_evaluation_of_internships_and_employability_in_the_ICT_sector","269903416_The_Third_Wave","260947591_New_New_Technologies_The_Future_and_the_Present_of_Work_in_Information_and_Communication_Technologies","251429444_Education_Enterprise_Culture_and_the_Entrepreneurial_Self_A_Foucauldian_Perspective","249698442_Scientifically_Based_Research_in_Education_Epistemology_and_Ethics","258173710_Digital_labor_is_the_new_killer_app","245092879_A_survey_and_critique_of_the_impacts_of_information_technology"]}
