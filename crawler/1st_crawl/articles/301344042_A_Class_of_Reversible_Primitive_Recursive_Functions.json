{"id":"301344042_A_Class_of_Reversible_Primitive_Recursive_Functions","abstract":"Reversible computing is bi-deterministic which means that its execution is both forward and backward deterministic, i.e. next/previous computational step is uniquely determined. Various approaches exist to catch its extensional or intensional aspects and properties. We present a class RPRF of reversible functions which holds at bay intensional aspects and emphasizes the extensional side of the reversible computation by following the style of Dedekind-Robinson Primitive Recursive Functions. The class RPRF is closed by inversion, can only express bijections on integers — not only natural numbers —, and it is expressive enough to simulate Primitive Recursive Functions, of course, in an effective way.","authors":["Luca Paolini","Mauro Piccolo","Luca Roversi"],"meta":["April 2016Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science 322:227-242","DOI:10.1016/j.entcs.2016.03.016","Project: Reversible computation"],"references":["276038269_Information_Theory_and_Computational_Thermodynamics_Lessons_for_Biology_from_Physics","345676927_Introduction_to_Reversible_Computing","325448108_Computability_An_introduction_to_recursive_function_theory","312628416_Logical_reversibility_of_computation","292711388_On_primitive_recursive_functions_of_large_range","287135226_Irreversibility_and_heat_generation_in_the_computing_process","274904300_On_Language","270150099_IMM_Introduction_to_metamathematics","265673638_Recursively_enumerable_sets_and_degrees_A_study_of_computable_functions_and_computably_generated_sets","256554794_Generation_of_invertible_functions"]}
