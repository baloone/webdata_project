{"id":"309091937_Quantifier_Alternation_for_Infinite_Words","abstract":"We investigate the expressive power of the quantifier alternation hierarchy of first-order logic over words. This hierarchy includes the classes \\(\\varSigma _{{i}}\\) (sentences having at most i blocks of quantifiers starting with an \\(\\exists \\)) and \\(\\mathcal {B}\\varSigma _{{i}}\\) (Boolean combinations of \\(\\varSigma _{{i}}\\) sentences). So far, this expressive power has been effectively characterized for the lower levels only. Recently, a breakthrough was made over finite words, and decidable characterizations were obtained for \\(\\mathcal {B}\\varSigma _{2}\\) and \\(\\varSigma _{3}\\), by relying on a decision problem called separation, and solving it for \\(\\varSigma _{2}\\).\nThe contribution of this paper is a generalization of these results to the setting of infinite words: we solve separation for \\(\\varSigma _{2}\\) and \\(\\varSigma _{3}\\), and obtain decidable characterizations of \\(\\mathcal {B}\\varSigma _{2}\\) and \\(\\varSigma _{3}\\) as consequences.","authors":["Th√©o Pierron","Thomas Place","Marc Zeitoun"],"meta":["April 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-3-662-49630-5_14","Conference: International Conference on Foundations of Software Science and Computation Structures","Project: Quantifier Alternation for Infinite Words"],"references":["285458778_Quantifier_Alternation_for_Infinite_Words","282072691_Level_Two_of_the_Quantifier_Alternation_Hierarchy_Over_Infinite_Words","235772028_Efficient_Separability_of_Regular_Languages_by_Subsequences_and_Suffixes","225953511_Fragments_of_First-Order_Logic_over_Infinite_Words","220268298_Word_Problems_Requiring_Exponential_Time_Preliminary_Report","312603594_On_a_decision_method_in_restricted_second_order_arithmetic_logic_methodology_and_philosophy_of_science","303691243_Level_Two_of_the_Quantifier_Alternation_Hierarchy_over_Infinite_Words","300051215_Separating_Regular_Languages_with_Two_Quantifiers_Alternations","284100771_Symposium_on_Decision_Problems_On_a_Decision_Method_in_Restricted_Second_Order_Arithmetic","282303975_Separation_and_the_successor_relation","262322971_The_common_fragment_of_ACTL_and_LTL","261952337_Going_Higher_in_the_First-Order_Quantifier_Alternation_Hierarchy_on_Words","260194322_Separating_Regular_Languages_with_First-Order_Logic","248596806_Finite_automata_and_logic_of_monadic_predicates","242942915_Weak_Second-Order_Arithmetic_and_Finite_Automata","239494065_Decision_problems_of_finite_automation_design_and_related_decision_problems","236326036_Separating_Regular_Languages_by_Piecewise_Testable_and_Unambiguous_Languages","225608503_Polynomial_Closure_and_Unambiguous_Product","222446091_On_finite_monoids_having_only_trivial_subgroups","222437820_The_dot-depth_hierarchy_of_star-free_languages_is_infinite","221350055_A_Concatenation_Game_and_the_Dot-Depth_Hierarchy","221220325_Piecewise_testable_events","220994779_Polynomial_Operations_on_Rational_Languages","220976507_Recent_Results_on_Automata_and_Infinite_Words","220898120_An_Eilenberg_Theorem_for_Infinity-Languages","2859018_Positive_Varieties_And_Infinite_Words"]}
