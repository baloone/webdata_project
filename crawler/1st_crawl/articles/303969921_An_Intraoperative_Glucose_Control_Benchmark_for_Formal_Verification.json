{"id":"303969921_An_Intraoperative_Glucose_Control_Benchmark_for_Formal_Verification","abstract":"Diabetes associated complications are affecting an increasingly large population of hospitalized patients. Since glucose physiology is significantly impacted by patient-specific parameters, it is critical to verify that a clinical glucose control protocol is safe across a wide patient population. A safe protocol should not drive the glucose level into dangerous low (hypoglycemia) or high (hyperglycemia) ranges. Verification of glucose controllers is challenging due to the high-dimensional, non-linear glucose physiological models which contain both unobservable states and unmeasurable patient-specific parameters. This paper presents a hybrid system model of a closed-loop physiological system that includes an existing FDA-accepted high-fidelity physiological model tailored to intraoperative settings and a validated improvement to a clinical glucose control protocol for diabetic cardiac surgery patients. We propose the closed-loop model as a physiological system benchmark for verification and present our initial results on verifying the system using the SMT-based hybrid system verification tool dReach.","authors":["Sanjian Chen","Matthew O'Kelly","James Weimer","Oleg Sokolsky"],"meta":["October 2015"],"references":["262787168_The_UVAPADOVA_type_1_diabetes_simulator_New_features","261430168_Evaluation_and_Enhancement_of_an_Intraoperative_Insulin_Infusion_Protocol_via_In-Silico_Simulation","230680291_SpaceEx_Scalable_Verification_of_Hybrid_Systems","229324151_Deaths_Final_Data_for_2008","303969399_Towards_a_Model-Based_Meal_Detector_for_Type_I_Diabetics","301972004_dReach_d-Reachability_Analysis_for_Hybrid_Systems","262274229_dReal_An_SMT_Solver_for_Nonlinear_Theories_over_the_Reals","262167988_Flow_An_Analyzer_for_Non-linear_Hybrid_Systems","258144854_Satisfiability_modulo_ODEs","234810128_Complexity_Theory_of_Real_Functions"]}
