{"id":"220318984_Adjacent_strong_edge_coloring_of_graphs","abstract":"For a graph G(V, E), if a proper k-edge coloring ƒ is satisfied with C(u) ≠ C(v) for uv ∈ E(G), where C(u) = {ƒ(uv) | uv ∈ E}, then ƒ is called k-adjacent strong edge coloring of G, is abbreviated k-ASEC, and χ′as(G) = min{k | k-ASECofG} is called the adjacent strong edge chromatic number of G. In this paper, we discuss some properties of χ′as(G), and obtain the χ′as(G) of some special graphs and present a conjecture: if G are graphs whose order of each component is at least six, then χ′as(G) ≤ Δ(G) + 2, where Δ(G) is the maximum degree of G.","authors":["Zhongfu Zhang","Linzhong Liu","Jianfang Wang"],"meta":["July 2002Applied Mathematics Letters 15(5):623-626","DOI:10.1016/S0893-9659(02)80015-5","SourceDBLP"],"references":["266210746_Conditional_colorability_in_graphs","248842480_Graphs_Digraphs_Third_Edition","230595932_Edge-Coloring_of_Graphs"]}
