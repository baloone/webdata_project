{"id":"347644614_JPEG_Pleno_Holography_Scope_and_Technology_Validation_Procedures","abstract":"JPEG Pleno is a standardization framework addressing the compression and signaling of plenoptic modalities. While the standardization of solutions to handle light field content is currently reaching its final stage, the Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) committee is now preparing for the standardization of solutions targeting point cloud and holographic modalities. This paper addresses the challenges related to the standardization of compression technologies for holographic content and associated test methodologies.","authors":["Raees Kizhakkumkara Muhamad","Tobias Birnbaum","Antonin Gilles","Saeed Mahmoudpour"],"meta":["December 2020Applied Optics 60(3)","DOI:10.1364/AO.404305"],"references":["343445305_Spatial_bandwidth-optimized_compression_of_image_plane_off-axis_holograms_with_image_and_video_codecs","342862719_Providing_a_Visual_Understanding_of_Holography_Through_Phase_Space_Representations","340366216_An_overview_of_the_emerging_JPEG_Pleno_standard_conformance_testing_and_reference_software","353162821_Quality_evaluation_of_holographic_images_coded_with_standard_codecs","345998809_Quality_Evaluation_Of_Static_Point_Clouds_Encoded_Using_MPEG_Codecs","340365548_A_comparison_of_hologram_plane_coding_and_object_plane_coding_on_different_types_of_holograms","337059563_Assessment_of_speckle_denoising_filters_for_digital_holography_using_subjective_and_objective_evaluation_models","335679534_JPEG_Pleno_light_field_coding_technologies","334022835_Point_cloud_quality_evaluation_Towards_a_definition_for_test_conditions","331070130_Holographic_tomography_hardware_and_software_solutions_for_3D_quantitative_biomedical_imaging"]}
