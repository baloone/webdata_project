{"id":"334407224_Superhuman_AI_for_multiplayer_poker","abstract":"In recent years there have been great strides in artificial intelligence (AI), with games often serving as challenge problems, benchmarks, and milestones for progress. Poker has served for decades as such a challenge problem. Past successes in such benchmarks, including poker, have been limited to two-player games. However, poker in particular is traditionally played with more than two players. Multiplayer games present fundamental additional issues beyond those in two-player games, and multiplayer poker is a recognized AI milestone. In this paper we present Pluribus, an AI that we show is stronger than top human professionals in six-player no-limit Texas holdâ€™em poker, the most popular form of poker played by humans.","authors":["Noam Brown","Tuomas Sandholm"],"meta":["July 2019Science 365(6456):eaay2400","DOI:10.1126/science.aay2400"],"references":["320473480_Mastering_the_game_of_Go_without_human_knowledge","292074166_Mastering_the_game_of_Go_with_deep_neural_networks_and_tree_search","220616737_The_Complexity_of_Computing_a_Nash_Equilibrium","326026856_Inapproximability_of_Nash_Equilibrium","321878591_Superhuman_AI_for_heads-up_no-limit_poker_Libratus_beats_top_professionals","312157307_DeepStack_Expert-Level_Artificial_Intelligence_in_No-Limit_Poker","307962829_Noncooperative_games","303957760_Rebooting_Computers_as_Learning_Machines","270657171_Computer_science_Heads-up_limit_hold'em_poker_is_solved","270656992_Computer_science_Solving_imperfect-information_games","230873253_Non-Cooperative_Games","228696705_One_Jump_Ahead","226584520_Zur_Theorie_der_Gesellschaftsspiele","222544943_Deep_blue","222396003_The_challenge_of_poker","220553632_The_Lemonade_Stand_Game_Competition_Solving_Unsolvable_Games","220430980_Lossless_abstraction_of_imperfect_information_games","220423062_Temporal_Difference_Learning_and_TD-Gammon","1764892_Settling_the_Complexity_of_Computing_Two-Player_Nash_Equilibria"]}
