{"id":"311617537_Multichannel_audio_source_separation_Variational_inference_of_time-frequency_sources_from_time-domain_observations","abstract":"A great number of methods for multichannel audio source separation are based on probabilistic approaches in which the sources are modeled as latent random variables in a time-frequency (TF) domain. For reverberant mixtures, most of the methods approximate the time-domain convolutive mixing process in the TF-domain, assuming short mixing filters. The TF latent sources are then inferred from the TF mixture observations. In this paper we propose to infer latent TF sources from the time-domain observations. This approach allows us to exactly model the convolutive mixing process. The inference procedure rely on a variational expectation-maximization algorithm. In significant reverberation conditions, we show that our approach leads a Signal-to-Distortion Ratio improvement of 5.5 dB.","authors":["Simon Leglaive","Roland Badeau","GaÃ«l Richard"],"meta":["March 2017","DOI:10.1109/ICASSP.2017.7951791","Conference: 42nd International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)At: New Orleans, USA"],"references":["297758397_Preservation_of_whiteness_in_spectral_and_time-frequency_transforms_of_second_order_processes","281657427_Alpha-Stable_Matrix_Factorization","280047188_Cauchy_Nonnegative_Matrix_Factorization","269295094_Hybrid_model_and_structured_sparsity_for_under-determined_convolutive_audio_source_separation","267917604_Probabilistic_Modeling_Paradigms_for_Audio_Source_Separation","261525679_Multichannel_High-Resolution_NMF_for_Modeling_Convolutive_Mixtures_of_Non-Stationary_Signals_in_the_Time-Frequency_Domain","260695669_Coding-Based_Informed_Source_Separation_Nonnegative_Tensor_Factorization_Approach","304372059_Multichannel_audio_declipping","281886469_Low-Rank_Time-Frequency_Synthesis","226353602_Speech_Dereverberation_Using_Statistical_Reverberation_Models"]}
