{"id":"224254762_Motion_denoising_with_application_to_time-lapse_photography","abstract":"Motions can occur over both short and long time scales. We introduce motion denoising, which treats short-term changes as noise, long-term changes as signal, and re-renders a video to reveal the underlying long-term events. We demonstrate motion denoising for time-lapse videos. One of the characteristics of traditional time-lapse imagery is stylized jerkiness, where short-term changes in the scene appear as small and annoying jitters in the video, often obfuscating the underlying temporal events of interest. We apply motion denoising for resynthesizing time-lapse videos showing the long-term evolution of a scene with jerky short-term changes removed. We show that existing filtering approaches are often incapable of achieving this task, and present a novel computational approach to denoise motion without explicit motion analysis. We demonstrate promising experimental results on a set of challenging time-lapse sequences.","authors":["Michael Rubinstein","Ce Liu","Peter Sand","Fredo Durand"],"meta":["July 2011Proceedings / CVPR, IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition.
