{"id":"353222928_Teaching_OR_automatic_evaluation_for_linear_programming_modelling","abstract":"Learning how to model a problem described in natural language as a linear program requires students to practice using various and numerous exercises. Moreover, immediate feedback on the validity of their solutions helps a better and faster understanding. In this paper, we present an idea on how students and teachers can automatically evaluate linear programming models. We also describe how this idea was implemented on the learning platform caseine.org and is now used by hundreds of students from various universities.","authors":["Hadrien Cambazard","Nicolas Catusse","Nadia Brauner","Pierre Lemaire"],"meta":["July 20214OR","DOI:10.1007/s10288-021-00488-9"],"references":["345139705_Linear_and_Integer_Optimization_Theory_and_Practice_Third_Edition","276195764_Linear_and_Integer_Optimization_Theory_and_Practice"]}
