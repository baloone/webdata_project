{"id":"289161957_Multi-view_supervised_latent_dirichlet_allocation","abstract":"In the paper, we mainly focus on classifition on multi-view data. Considering that ensemble methods can combine weak classifiers to construct a strong classifier, and topic model can learn latent representations from complex data, we try to introduce ensemble idea to topic model, such that predictive latent representation could be obtained and multi-view classifier could be learned. We propose multi-view supervised latent Dirichlet allocation (multi-view sLDA) model by combining latent Dirichlet allocation model and the mixture of softmax model which is an ensemble classification model. Moreover, we derive a parameter estimation algorithm of the proposed model based on variational expectation maximization (EM) procedure. The experimental results on two real datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed model. Â©, 2014, Tien Tzu Hsueh Pao/Acta Electronica Sinica. All right reserved.","authors":["X.-X. Li","R.-F.
