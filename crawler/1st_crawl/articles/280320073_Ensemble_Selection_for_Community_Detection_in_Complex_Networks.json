{"id":"280320073_Ensemble_Selection_for_Community_Detection_in_Complex_Networks","abstract":"Ensemble clustering approaches have been recently applied, in a variety of ways, in order to enhance the quality and/or the execution time of community detection tasks. The quality gain that can be obtained from applying ensemble approaches is known to be tightly linked to both quality and diversity of the applied clusterings. However, most of existing work simply ignore this important issue of ensemble selection. In this paper we intend to fill this gap. We propose a graph-based ensemble selection approach that allow to take into account both criteria of quality and diversity. Different quality measures are also considered: cluster-oriented quality and network-oriented quality functions. Experiments on real network datasets show the validity of our approach.","authors":["Rushed Kanawati"],"meta":["August 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-20367-6_15","Conference: 7th international conference on Social Computing and Social Media"],"references":["267125463_YASCA_An_Ensemble-Based_Approach_for_Community_Detection_in_Complex_Networks","259891714_Engineering_High-Performance_Community_Detection_Heuristics_for_Massive_Graphs","248519014_An_Information_Flow_Model_for_Conflict_and_Fission_in_Small_Groups1","280566512_Networks_An_Introduction","280320229_Ensemble_selection_for_enhancing_graph_coarsening_quality","269729352_Empirical_evaluation_of_applying_ensemble_methods_to_ego-centred_community_identification_in_complex_networks","264920260_Networks_An_Introduction","256326901_Ensemble_approaches_for_improving_community_detection_methods","239761877_Community_cores_in_evolving_networks","227535738_Cluster_Ensemble_Selection"]}
