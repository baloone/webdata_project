{"id":"265554646_An_introduction_to_quantum_machine_learning","abstract":"Machine learning algorithms learn a desired input-output relation from\nexamples in order to interpret new inputs. This is important for tasks such as\nimage and speech recognition or strategy optimisation, with growing\napplications in the IT industry. In the last couple of years, researchers\ninvestigated if quantum computing can help to improve classical machine\nlearning algorithms. Ideas range from running computationally costly algorithms\nor their subroutines efficiently on a quantum computer to the translation of\nstochastic methods into the language of quantum theory. This contribution gives\na systematic overview of the emerging field of quantum machine learning. It\npresents the approaches as well as technical details in an accessable way, and\ndiscusses the potential of a future theory of quantum learning.","authors":["Maria Schuld","Ilya Sinayskiy","Francesco Petruccione"],"meta":["September 2014Contemporary Physics 56(2)","DOI:10.1080/00107514.2014.964942","SourcearXiv"],"references":["265209779_The_quest_for_a_Quantum_Neural_Network","263352371_Hidden_Quantum_Markov_Models_and_Open_Quantum_Systems_with_Instantaneous_Feedback","260526004_Quantum_decision_tree_classifier","330356980_A_First_Course_in_Machine_Learning","312532641_Theoretical_Neuroscience","301858131_Quantum_Associative_Memory","275400569_Quantum_partially_observable_Markov_decision_processes","265564295_Quantum_Computation_and_Quantum_Information_10th_Anniversary_Edition","262562753_Introduction_to_Machine_Learning","262175690_Neurodynamics_and_attractors_in_quantum_associative_memories"]}
