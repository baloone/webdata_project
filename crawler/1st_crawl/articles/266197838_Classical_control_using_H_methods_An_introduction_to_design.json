{"id":"266197838_Classical_control_using_H_methods_An_introduction_to_design","abstract":"Purpose of this book\nOne of the main accomplishments of control in the 1980s was the development of H ∞ engineering. This book teaches control system design using H ∞ techniques, and H ∞ theory motivated by control applications.\nThe first parts of the book are aimed at students of control at any level who want an H ∞ supplement to their control course. The later parts of the book treat the theory of H ∞ control and should be valuable to theoreticians in control and to research mathematicians. Even practitioners might benefit from a light reading of this theory, while mathematicians who want a physical feel for control should like the beginning of the book.\nSince the book is highly modular the theory parts can be read independently of the design parts, and vice versa. Thus the book should be useful for three purposes.","authors":["J.William Helton","Orlando Merino"],"meta":["January 1998","DOI:10.1137/1.9781611971361"],"references":[]}
