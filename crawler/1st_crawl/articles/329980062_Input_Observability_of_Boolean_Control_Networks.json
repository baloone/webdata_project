{"id":"329980062_Input_Observability_of_Boolean_Control_Networks","abstract":"This paper devotes to the input observability, which also is called the nonsingularity or left invertibility, of general Boolean control networks. First, using graphic approach converts the global nonsingularity into pointwise finite-step nonsingularity. Subsequently, a series of matrix-form criterions are given to identify the nonsingularity, under which suitable inverse Boolean control networks can be designed. Finally, one application and one numerical example are used to illustrate the feasibility and validity of the obtained results.","authors":["Yongyuan Yu","Biao Wang","Jun-e Feng"],"meta":["December 2018Neurocomputing 333","DOI:10.1016/j.neucom.2018.12.014"],"references":[]}
