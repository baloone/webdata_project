{"id":"321414436_Extending_the_Power_Watershed_Framework_Thanks_to_Gamma-Convergence","abstract":"In this paper, we provide a formal proof of the power watershed framework relying on the Ð“-convergence framework. The main ingredient for the proof is a concept of scale. The proof and the formalism introduced in this paper have the added benefit of clarifying the algorithm and allowing extension of the applicability of the power watershed algorithm to many other types of energy functions. Several examples of applications are provided, including total variation and spectral clustering.","authors":["Laurent Najman"],"meta":["January 2017SIAM Journal on Imaging Sciences 10(4):2275-2292","DOI:10.1137/17M1118580"],"references":["264573714_Tree_Filtering_Efficient_Structure-Preserving_Smoothing_With_a_Minimum_Spanning_Tree"]}
