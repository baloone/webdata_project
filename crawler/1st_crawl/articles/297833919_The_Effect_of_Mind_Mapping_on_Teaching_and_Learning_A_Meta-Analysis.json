{"id":"297833919_The_Effect_of_Mind_Mapping_on_Teaching_and_Learning_A_Meta-Analysis","abstract":"To improve teaching and learning, it has become increasingly popular to use visualized tools for study. We try to find out the effect of mind mapping on teaching and learning considering the advantage of mind mapping. Although numerous research studies have shown the advantage, there aren't conclusive results yielding. To conform the effect, we adopt the method of meta-analysis by reviewing experimental and quasi-experimental studies. The meta-analysis shows that mind mapping has positive effect on teaching and learning and country, usage, subject and achievement can influence the results.","authors":["Ying Liu","Guoqing Zhao","Guozhen Ma","Yuwei Bo"],"meta":["April 2014"],"references":["275542901_The_Impact_of_Digital_Mind_Maps_on_Science_Achievement_among_Sixth_Grade_Students_in_Saudi_Arabia","263029293_The_effect_of_concept_mapping_on_students'_learning_achievements_and_interests","258830986_Retrieval_Practice_with_or_without_Mind_Mapping_Boosts_Fact_Learning_in_Primary_School_Children","257714219_Teacher-Centered_Mind_Mapping_vs_Student-Centered_Mind_Mapping_in_the_Teaching_of_Accounting_at_Pre-U_Level_-_An_Action_Research","248606966_Technologically_-_supported_mind_and_concept_maps_prepared_by_students_on_the_subjects_of_the_unit_systems_in_our_body","306939383_The_magical_number_seven_plus_or_minus_two_Some_limits_on_our_capacity_to_process_information","284045448_The_effects_of_note_taking_in_science_education_through_the_mind_mapping_technique_on_students'_attitudes_academic_achievement_and_concept_learning","250947951_The_Effects_of_Advance_Organizers_Prepared_for_Specific_Ability_Levels","247932013_The_Mind_Map_Book_How_to_Use_Radiant_Thinking_to_Maximize_Your_Brain''s_Untapped_Potential_New_Yo","240801751_Choice_of_the_Metric_for_Effect_Size_in_Meta-Analysis"]}
