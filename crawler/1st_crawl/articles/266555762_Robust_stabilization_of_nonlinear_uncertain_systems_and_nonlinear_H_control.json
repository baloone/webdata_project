{"id":"266555762_Robust_stabilization_of_nonlinear_uncertain_systems_and_nonlinear_H_control","abstract":"The local robust stabilization for a class of nonlinear uncertain systems is considered. The robustness concept of Lyapunov - type stabilizability for Lyapunov-type is defined. Under the uncertainty satisfying structured condition of norm-bounded, two cases for uncertainty in control matrix are taken to discuss Lyapunov-type stabilizability of systems. The sufficient conditions of Lyapunov-type stabilizability are given repectively from points of view of nonlinear Hâˆž control and from the differential geometry.","authors":["Liangui Wang"],"meta":["September 2001Zhongshan Daxue Xuebao/Acta Scientiarum Natralium Universitatis Sunyatseni 40(5)"],"references":[]}
