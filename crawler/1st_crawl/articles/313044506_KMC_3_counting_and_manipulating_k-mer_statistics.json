{"id":"313044506_KMC_3_counting_and_manipulating_k-mer_statistics","abstract":"Counting all k -mers in a given dataset is a standard procedure in many bioinformatics applications. We introduce KMC3, a significant improvement of the former KMC2 algorithm together with KMC tools for manipulating k -mer databases. Usefulness of the tools is shown on a few real problems.\n\nAvailability: \nProgram is freely available at http://sun.aei.polsl.pl/REFRESH/kmc .\n\nContact: \nsebastian.deorowicz@polsl.pl.\n\nSupplementary information: \nSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","authors":["Marek Kokot","Maciej DÅ‚ugosz","Sebastian Deorowicz"],"meta":["January 2017Bioinformatics 33(17)","DOI:10.1093/bioinformatics/btx304","Project: k-mer counting algorithms"],"references":["315781042_Gerbil_A_fast_and_memory-efficient_k-mer_counter_with_GPU-support","303828914_Extensive_sequencing_of_seven_human_genomes_to_characterize_benchmark_reference_materials","285635182_Genome_Tester4_A_toolkit_for_performing_basic_set_operations_-_union_intersection_and_complement_on_k-mer_lists","263736737_KMC_2_Fast_and_resource-frugal_k-mer_counting","259491921_DIAMUND_Direct_comparison_of_genomes_to_detect_mutations","303891663_KCMBT_a_k_-mer_Counter_based_on_Multiple_Burst_Trees","235895627_Mutation_identification_by_direct_comparison_of_whole-genome_sequencing_data_from_mutant_and_wild-type_individuals_using_k-mers"]}
