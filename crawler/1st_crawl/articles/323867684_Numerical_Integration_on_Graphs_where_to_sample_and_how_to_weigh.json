{"id":"323867684_Numerical_Integration_on_Graphs_where_to_sample_and_how_to_weigh","abstract":"Let $G=(V,E,w)$ be a finite, connected graph with weighted edges. We are interested in the problem of finding a subset $W \\subset V$ of vertices and weights $a_w$ such that $$ \\frac{1}{|V|}\\sum_{v \\in V}^{}{f(v)} \\sim \\sum_{w \\in W}{a_w f(w)}$$ for functions $f:V \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ that are `smooth' with respect to the geometry of the graph. The main application are problems where $f$ is known to somehow depend on the underlying graph but is expensive to evaluate on even a single vertex. We prove an inequality showing that the integration problem can be rewritten as a geometric problem (`the optimal packing of heat balls'). We discuss how one would construct approximate solutions of the heat ball packing problem; numerical examples demonstrate the efficiency of the method.","authors":["George C.
