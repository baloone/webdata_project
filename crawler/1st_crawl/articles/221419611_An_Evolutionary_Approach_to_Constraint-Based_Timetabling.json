{"id":"221419611_An_Evolutionary_Approach_to_Constraint-Based_Timetabling","abstract":"In this paper we present a timetabling system that uses a combination of a genetic algorithm and constraint satisfaction to\nmaximally satisfy constraints of different strengths. A prototype system is presented for university examination timetabling.\nExperiments performed with different parameter settings for the genetic algorithm on some real world data are reported. The\nresults obtained from the prototype are promising. An extension to the system is proposed to support incremental processing\nof user-supplied constraints. This is needed to support user-guided exploration of the solution space and to capture the incremental\nnature of human timetabling.","authors":["Dharmendra Sharma","Nivlesh Chandra"],"meta":["August 2000","DOI:10.1007/3-540-45408-X_9","SourceDBLP","Conference: Advances in Artificial Intelligence.
