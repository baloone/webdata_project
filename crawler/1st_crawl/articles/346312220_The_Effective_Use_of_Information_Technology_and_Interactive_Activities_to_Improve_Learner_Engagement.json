Teachers face several challenges to engage learners in different disciplines, including computer science. This research conducts a review of BSc (Computer Science) programmes and introduces interactive activities to enhance learner engagement. The study was conducted using a repeated measure design involving 24 participants. The findings revealed that the use of technology, and collaborative and interactive activities in groups may positively influence learner engagement. The participantsâ€™ feedback before and after introduction of group tasks and interactive activities showed a significant (p < 0.001) and increasing trend in response to questions-related learner engagement. The participants agreed that their learning experience and engagement enhanced with the use of technology and interactive and collaborative activities","authors":["Abrar Ullah","Sajid Anwar"],"meta":["November 2020Education Sciences 10(12)","DOI:10.3390/educsci10120349"],"references":["344593373_The_Curriculum_Design_Coherence_Model","342344822_Online_Learning_A_Panacea_in_the_Time_of_COVID-19_Crisis","341491955_CoronaVirus_COVID-19_and_Online_Learning_in_Higher_Institutions_of_Education_A_Survey_of_the_Perceptions_of_Ghanaian_International_Students_in_China","334614768_Learning_from_African_Classroom_Pedagogy_to_Increase_Student_Engagement_in_Education_Technologies","334575261_Student-centred_digital_game-based_learning_a_conceptual_framework_and_survey_of_the_state_of_the_art","334485923_Teaching_Methods_for_Computer_Science_Education_in_the_Context_of_Significant_Learning_Theories","344195205_Concept-based_curriculum_design_and_implementation_strategies","339235415_Digital_distraction_in_the_classroom_exploring_instructor_perceptions_and_reactions","338578612_Reassessing_Disparities_in_Online_Learner_Student_Engagement_in_Higher_Education","336080362_Incorporating_Paper_Clicker_Plicker_Questions_in_General_Chemistry_Courses_To_Enhance_Active_Learning_and_Limit_Distractions"]}
