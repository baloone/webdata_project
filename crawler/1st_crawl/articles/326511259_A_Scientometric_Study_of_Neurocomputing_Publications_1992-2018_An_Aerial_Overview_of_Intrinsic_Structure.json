{"id":"326511259_A_Scientometric_Study_of_Neurocomputing_Publications_1992-2018_An_Aerial_Overview_of_Intrinsic_Structure","abstract":"The international journal of neurocomputing (NC) is considered to be one of the most sought out journals in the computer science research fraternity. In this paper, an extensive bibliometric overview of this journal is performed. The bibliometric data is extracted from the Web of Science (WoS) repository. The main objective of this study is to reveal internal structures and hidden inferences, such as highly productive and influential authors, most contributing countries, top institutions, collaborating authors, and so on. The CiteSpace and VOS viewer is used to visualize the graphical mapping of the bibliometric data. Further, the document co-citations network, cluster detection and references with strong citation burst is analyzed to reveal the intellectual base of NC publications.","authors":["Manvendra Janmaijaya","Amit K.
