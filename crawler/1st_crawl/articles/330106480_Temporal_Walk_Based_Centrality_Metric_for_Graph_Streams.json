{"id":"330106480_Temporal_Walk_Based_Centrality_Metric_for_Graph_Streams","abstract":"Centrality measures account for the importance of the nodes of a network. In the seminal study of Boldi and Vigna (2014), the comparative evaluation of centrality measures was termed a difficult , arduous task. In networks with fast dynamics, such as the Twitter mention or retweet graphs, predicting emerging central-ity is even more challenging. Our main result is a new, temporal walk based dynamic centrality measure that models temporal information propagation by considering the order of edge creation. This measure outperforms graph snapshot based static and other recently proposed dynamic centrality measures in assigning the highest time-aware centrality to the actually relevant nodes of the network. One of our main contributions is creating a quantitative experiment to assess temporal centrality metrics. Our data and codes are publicly available.","authors":["Ferenc Béres","Róbert Pálovics","András A.
