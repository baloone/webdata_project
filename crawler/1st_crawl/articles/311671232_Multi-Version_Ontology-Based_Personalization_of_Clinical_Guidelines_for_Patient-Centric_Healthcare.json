{"id":"311671232_Multi-Version_Ontology-Based_Personalization_of_Clinical_Guidelines_for_Patient-Centric_Healthcare","abstract":"When dealing with a specific patient case, physicians are often interested in retrieving a personalized version of a clinical guideline, that is a version tailored to their use needs. In a patient-centric scenario, empowered patients make up another class of users interested in retrieving personalized care plans from a guideline repository. In their previous work, the authors proposed techniques to efficiently provide ontology-based personalized access to very large collections of multi-version clinical guidelines. In this paper, they address the problem of also dealing with a multi-version ontology used to support personalized access to clinical guidelines. The authors' approach allows the semantic indexing of guideline contents with respect to multi-version ontology classes and exploits the IS-A relationship among such classes for granting personalized access. Efficiency is ensured by a newly introduced annotation scheme for guidelines and solutions to cope with the evolution of ontology structure. The tests performed on a prototype implementation confirm the goodness of the approach.","authors":["Fabio Grandi","Federica Mandreoli","Riccardo Martoglia"],"meta":["January 2017International journal on Semantic Web and information systems 13(1):104-127","DOI:10.4018/IJSWIS.2017010107"],"references":["235604294_Enabling_Ontology_Based_Semantic_Queries_in_Biomedical_Database_Systems","235559981_Introducing_an_Annotated_Bibliography_on_Temporal_and_Evolution_Aspects_in_the_Semantic_Web","224818185_Adaptation_of_Clinical_Practice_Guidelines","221770059_An_ontology-based_personalization_of_health-care_knowledge_to_support_clinical_decisions_for_chronically_ill_patients","221450651_Clinical_Guidelines_Adaptation_Managing_Authoring_and_Versioning_Issues","220515742_Ontological_User_Profiling_in_Recommender_Systems","220308979_A_Multilayer_Ontology-based_Hybrid_Recommendation_Model","220220839_Learning_Ontology-Based_User_Profiles_A_Semantic_Approach_to_Personalized_Web_Search","12338747_GEM_A_Proposal_for_a_More_Comprehensive_Guideline_Document_Model_Using_XML","4238255_Ontology-Based_Information_Tailoring","312772369_An_Ontology_Based_Approach_to_the_Provision_of_Personalized_Patient_Education","312721515_Introducing_Wikidata_to_the_Linked_Data_Web","285899662_Making_healthcare_more_accessible_better_faster_and_cheaper_the_MobiGuide_Project","278742541_Dynamic_class_hierarchy_management_for_multi-version_ontology-based_personalization","273151903_Effectiveness_of_a_Web-Based_Tailored_Interactive_Health_Communication_Application_for_Patients_With_Type_2_Diabetes_or_Chronic_Low_Back_Pain_Randomized_Controlled_Trial","269311371_A_study_on_ontology_storage_based_on_relational_database","262370901_Supporting_Temporal_Slicing_in_XML_Databases","261860492_Dynamic_multi-version_ontology-based_personalization","261039542_The_Valid_Ontology_a_Simple_OWL_Temporal_Versioning_Framework","245566491_Automated_creation_of_clinical-practice_guidelines_from_decision_models","236120916_198_Chapter_X_Issues_in_Personalized_Access_to_Multi-Version_XML_Documents","235880574_Creating_personalised_clinical_pathways_by_semantic_interoperability_with_electronic_health_records","233764464_SigTurE-Destination_Ontology-based_personalized_recommendation_of_Tourism_and_Leisure_Activities","232810455_The_role_of_practice_guidelines_in_medical_malpractice_litigation","232722579_Automated_generation_of_patient-tailored_electronic_care_pathways_by_translating_computer-interpretable_guidelines_into_hierarchical_task_networks","230665580_Efficient_management_of_multi-version_clinical_guidelines","228154418_Of_Swords_and_Shields_The_Role_of_Clinical_Practice_Guidelines_in_Medical_Malpractice_Litigation","221450368_Ontology-Based_Personalization_and_Modulation_of_Computerized_Cognitive_Exercises","221310628_SOR_A_Practical_System_for_Ontology_Storage_Reasoning_and_Search","46305434_A_Practical_Method_for_Transforming_Free-Text_Eligibility_Criteria_into_Computable_Criteria","37685628_Ontology_Reasoning_With_Large_Data_Repositories","27293566_Personalized_Views_of_Personalization","23414299_Versioning_computer-interpretable_guidelines_Semi-automatic_modeling_of_'Living_Guidelines'_using_an_information_extraction_method","13884555_A_Normative_Analytic_Framework_for_Development_of_Practice_Guidelines_for_Specific_Clinical_Populations","13506176_The_Asgaard_Project_A_Task-Specific_Framework_for_the_Application_and_Critiquing_of_Time-Oriented_Clinical_Guidelines","11854318_Publishing_Web-based_Guidelines_Using_Interactive_Decision_Models","8884202_An_Enriched_Unified_Medical_Language_System_Semantic_Network_with_a_Multiple_Subsumption_Hierarchy","8353117_A_methodology_for_modular_representation_of_guidelines","8227592_A_framework_for_a_distributed_hybrid_multiple-ontology_clinical-guideline_library_and_automated_guideline-support_tools","6560879_Investigating_subsumption_in_SNOMED_CT_An_exploration_into_large_description_logic-based_biomedical_terminologies"]}
