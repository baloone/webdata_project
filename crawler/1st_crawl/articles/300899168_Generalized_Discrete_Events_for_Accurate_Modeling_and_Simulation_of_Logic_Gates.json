{"id":"300899168_Generalized_Discrete_Events_for_Accurate_Modeling_and_Simulation_of_Logic_Gates","abstract":"In this chapter, we present and demonstrate the advantages of the Generalized Discrete EVent system Specification (GDEVS) to build accurate discrete-event models of dynamic systems. These theoretical concepts are applied to the field of logic gate design and analysis in order to get more accurate and fast simulations. States are represented with linear piecewise trajectories contrary to the classical Boolean logic models where states have constant piecewise trajectories (0 and 1). With GDEVS models, the transition from a low level to a high one and vice versa is a linear trajectory and is more realistic than the instantaneous transitions of classical logic gate models. We also demonstrate that this accurate representation does not require any more computations than in Discrete EVent system Specification (DEVS).","authors":["Maamar El Amine Hamri","Norbert Giambiasi","Aziz Naamane"],"meta":["January 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-15096-3_12","In book: Concepts and Methodologies for Modeling and Simulation (pp.257-272)","Project: Modeling and Simulation"],"references":["238123651_Theory_of_Modeling_and_Simulation_2nd_Edition","200048348_Simulation-Based_Validation_of_VHDL_Description_Using_Constraints_Logic_Programming","316083321_Modeling_and_Simulation_Dictionary_-_English-French-Turkish","316012576_GDEVS_A_Generalized_Discrete_Event_Specification_for_Accurate_Modeling_of_Dynamic_systems","288981317_GEST_-_A_Modelling_and_Simulation_Language_Based_on_System_Theoretic_Concepts","271481907_Generalized_Discrete_Event_Specifications_of_logic_gates","258187213_Concepts_for_advanced_simulation_methodologies","222660348_BFS-DEVS_A_general_DEVS-based_formalism_for_behavioral_fault_simulation","221440073_GDEVS_A_Generalized_Discrete_Event_Specification_for_Accurate_Modeling_of_Dynamic_Systems","220264069_Modelisation_multivue_et_simulation_a_evenements_discrets","220164876_Breakthrough_in_Modeling_and_Simulation_of_Mixed-Signal_Electronic_Designs_in_nVHDL"]}
