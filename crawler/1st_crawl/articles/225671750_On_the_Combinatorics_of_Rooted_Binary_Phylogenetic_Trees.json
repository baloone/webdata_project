{"id":"225671750_On_the_Combinatorics_of_Rooted_Binary_Phylogenetic_Trees","abstract":"We study subtree-prune-and-regraft (SPR) operations on \nleaf-labelled rooted binary trees, also known as rooted binary phylogenetic trees. \nThis study is motivated by the problem of\ngraphically representing evolutionary histories of biological sequences subject to recombination.\nWe investigate some basic properties of the induced SPR-metric on the space \n\nTnr \\mathcal{T}_{n}^{\\mathrm{r}} \n\nof leaf-labelled\nrooted binary trees with n leaves. In contrast to the case of \nunrooted trees, the number |U(T)| of trees in \n\nTnr \\mathcal{T}_{n}^{\\mathrm{r}} \n\nwhich are one SPR operation away from a given tree \n\nT ÃŽ Tnr T \\in \\mathcal{T}_{n}^{\\mathrm{r}} \ndepends on the\ntopology of T. In this paper, we construct recursion relations which allow one to determine the\nunit-neighbourhood size |U(T)| efficiently for any tree topology. In fact, using the recursion\nrelations we are able to derive a simple closed-form formula for the unit-neighbourhood size.\nAs a corollary, we construct sharp upper and lower bounds on the size of unit-neighbourhoods\nand investigate the diameter of \n\nTnr \\mathcal{T}_{n}^{\\mathrm{r}} \n. \nLastly, we consider an enumeration problem relevant to population genetics.","authors":["YunS.
