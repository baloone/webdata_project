{"id":"234800941_Automata_on_Infinite_Objects","abstract":"This chapter focuses on finite automata on infinite sequences and infinite trees. The chapter discusses the complexity of the complementation process and the equivalence test. Deterministic Muller automata and nondeterministic Buchi automata are equivalent in recognition power. Any nonempty Rabin recognizable set contains a regular tree and shows that the emptiness problem for Rabin tree automata is decidable. The chapter discusses the formulation of two interesting generalizations of Rabin's Tree Theorem and presents some remarks on the undecidable extensions of the monadic theory of the binary tree. A short overview of the work that studies the fine structure of the class of Rabin recognizable sets of trees is also presented in the chapter. Depending on the formalism in which tree properties are classified, the results fall in three categories: monadic second-order logic, tree automata, and fixed-point calculi.","authors":["Wolfgang Thomas"],"meta":["January 1991","DOI:10.1016/B978-0-444-88074-1.50009-3"],"references":["226063515_Pushdown_tree_automata","225164336_Relations_rationnelles_infinitaires","225117200_On_the_synthesis_of_an_asynchronous_reactive_module","220897772_Alternating_Automata_The_Weak_Monadic_Theory_of_the_Tree_and_its_Complexity","220566860_Recognizing_Safety_and_Liveness","242942915_Weak_Second-Order_Arithmetic_and_Finite_Automata","238698002_Decision_Problems_for_omega-Automata","226819647_The_Recursive_Sets_in_Certain_Monadic_Second_Order_Fragments_of_Arithmetic","226689038_Generalized_finite_automata_theory_with_an_application_to_a_decision_problem_of_second-order_logic","220898280_Realizable_and_Unrealizable_Specifications_of_Reactive_Systems","220897931_On_Fixed-Point_Clones_Extended_Abstract","220897189_Computation_Tree_Logic_CTL_and_Path_Quantifiers_in_the_Monadic_Theory_of_the_Binary_Tree","220897006_The_Propositional_Mu-Calculus_is_Elementary","220544564_Formal_Computations_of_Non_Deterministic_Recursive_Program_Schemes","4355948_Infinite_sequences_and_finite_machines","3501227_On_simultaneously_determinizing_and_complementing_o-automata"]}
