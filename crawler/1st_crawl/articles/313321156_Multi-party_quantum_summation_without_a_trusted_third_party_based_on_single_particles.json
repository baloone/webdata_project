{"id":"313321156_Multi-party_quantum_summation_without_a_trusted_third_party_based_on_single_particles","abstract":"We propose multi-party quantum summation protocols based on single particles, in which participants are allowed to compute the summation of their inputs without the help of a trusted third party and preserve the privacy of their inputs. Only one participant who generates the source particles needs to perform unitary operations and only single particles are needed in the beginning of the protocols.","authors":["Cai Zhang","Haozhen Situ","Qiong Huang","Pingle Yang"],"meta":["March 2017International Journal of Quantum Information 15(2):1750010","DOI:10.1142/S0219749917500101"],"references":["291420684_Secure_Multiparty_Quantum_Computation_for_Summation_and_Multiplication","255825105_Trojan-horse_attacks_on_quantum-key-distribution_systems","233873239_Complete_Insecurity_of_Quantum_Protocols_for_Classical_Two-Party_Computation","222698860_On_a_problem_in_quantum_summation","12332437_Simple_Proof_of_Security_of_the_BB84_Quantum_Key_Distribution_Protocol","7387649_Experimental_Single_Qubit_Quantum_Secret_Sharing","2202743_Unconditional_Security_Of_Quantum_Key_Distribution_Over_Arbitrarily_Long_Distances","2200098_Improving_the_security_of_secure_direct_communication_based_on_secret_transmitting_order_of_particles","2191524_Quantum_Boolean_Summation_with_Repetitions_in_the_Worst-Average_Setting","278048498_Quantum_Secret_Sharing_and_Random_Hopping_Using_single_states_instead_of_entanglement","276455918_Three-party_quantum_summation_without_a_trusted_third_party","260456504_High-Capacity_Quantum_Summation_with_Single_Photons_in_Both_Polarization_and_Spatial-Mode_Degrees_of_Freedom","257978323_Improving_the_security_of_multiparty_quantum_secret_sharing_against_Trojan_horse_attack","228109551_Quantum_secret_sharing","225809116_An_Efficient_Protocol_for_the_Secure_Multi-party_Quantum_Summation","222677258_Quantum_Summation_with_an_Application_to_Integration","222393678_Towards_quantum-based_privacy_and_voting","51963327_Continuous_Variable_Quantum_Key_Distribution_Finite-Key_Analysis_of_Composable_Security_against_Coherent_Attacks","48194637_Quantum_key_distribution_based_on_orthogonal_states_allows_securequantum_bit_commitment","12193062_Quantum_Key_Distribution_in_the_Holevo_Limit","2355676_Insecurity_of_Quantum_Secure_Computations"]}
