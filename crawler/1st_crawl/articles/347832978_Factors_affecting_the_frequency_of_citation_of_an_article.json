{"id":"347832978_Factors_affecting_the_frequency_of_citation_of_an_article","abstract":"The relevance of citations is clear since they constitute a substantial part of most bibliometric indicators. The aims of the present paper are to identify several factors associated with obtaining citations to explain these and, finally, to offer authors a number of useful suggestions. Those studies that have had the greatest influence on science are also those that are most frequently cited. The essential factor leading to a study being cited is that it should make a significant contribution to the advance of science; that is, the relevance of the research. But other essential dimensions exist: Accessibility; Dissemination; Scientific authority. Other predictive factors allow us to predict the number of citations a document may receive: Prior production by the authors; Structural context of the work; Scientific trends; Validity/Obsolescence (expiry) of results; Quality of formal aspects; Theoretical context of the study; Types of work. Finally, some ways are suggested to improve the citations of their works and thus contribute to a wider dissemination and development of science.","authors":["Rafael Repiso","Alicia Moreno-Delgado","Ignacio Aguaded"],"meta":["August 2020","DOI:10.47909/ijsmc.08"],"references":["325886413_Received_citations_as_a_main_SEO_factor_of_Google_Scholar_results_ranking","257986378_Effective_Strategies_for_Increasing_Citation_Frequency","220365133_Sleeping_Beauties_in_Science","285666280_The_Frequency_Distribution_of_Scientific_Productivity","250097778_Can_nobel_prize_winners_be_predicted","227682577_Is_Scientific_Literature_Subject_to_a_'Sell-By-Date'_A_General_Methodology_to_Analyze_the_'Durability'_of_Scientific_Documents","225944286_Toward_a_multi-disciplinary_Bradford_Law","220435273_Long-term_variations_in_the_aging_of_scientific_literature_From_exponential_growth_to_steady-state_science_1900-2004"]}
