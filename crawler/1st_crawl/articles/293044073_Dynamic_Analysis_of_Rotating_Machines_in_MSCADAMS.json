{"id":"293044073_Dynamic_Analysis_of_Rotating_Machines_in_MSCADAMS","abstract":"The paper publishes a dynamical analysis of misalignment of rotating machines in programme for dynamic of systems of bodies MSC. ADAMS. There are two basic types of misalignment analysed, parallel and angular. In shaft support of virtual models of each type of misalignment, there are parameters as deflection, velocity and acceleration analysed. Symptoms of failure states will be presented in frequency spectrums processed by Fourier transformation.","authors":["Alzbeta Sapietova","Vladimir Dekys"],"meta":["December 2016Procedia Engineering 136:143-149","DOI:10.1016/j.proeng.2016.01.188","Project: APVV-0736-12, Degradation of fiber-reinforced composite structures under cyclic loading"],"references":["286994540_Solution_of_mechanical_systems_with_uncertainty_parameters_using_ifea","285765954_Some_computational_aspects_of_vehicle_shell_frames_optimization_subjected_to_fatigue_life","281412166_Determination_the_contact_stress_depending_on_the_load_rate_of_the_NU220_roller_bearing","281425009_Dynamic_Analysis_of_Winding_Mechanisms_for_Manufacturing_of_Raw_Tyres","275422354_Shaft_Alignment_Handbook","272004559_Simulation_and_Analysis_of_Defect_Distribution_in_Passenger_Car_Tire_under_Dynamic_Loading","40322326_Technicka_diagnostika_a_spolehlivost","40322016_Technicka_diagnostika_a_spolehlivost_II_Vibrodiagnostika","37406253_Rotating_machinery_vibration_from_analysis_to_troubleshooting"]}
