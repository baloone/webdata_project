{"id":"277081704_Direct_Medical_Costs_of_Hospitalizations_for_Cardiovascular_Diseases_in_Shanghai_China","abstract":"Few studies in China have focused on direct expenditures for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), making cost trends for CVDs uncertain. Epidemic modeling and forecasting may be essential for health workers and policy makers to reduce the cost burden of CVDs.\nTo develop a time series model using Box–Jenkins methodology for a 15-year forecasting of CVD hospitalization costs in Shanghai.\nDaily visits and medical expenditures for CVD hospitalizations between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2012 were analyzed. Data from 2012 were used for further analyses, including yearly total health expenditures and expenditures per visit for each disease, as well as per-visit-per-year medical costs of each service for CVD hospitalizations. Time series analyses were performed to determine the long-time trend of total direct medical expenditures for CVDs and specific expenditures for each disease, which were used to forecast expenditures until December 31, 2030.\nFrom 2008 to 2012, there were increased yearly trends for both hospitalizations (from 250,354 to 322,676) and total costs (from US $ 388.52 to 721.58 million per year in 2014 currency) in Shanghai. Cost per CVD hospitalization in 2012 averaged US $ 2236.29, with the highest being for chronic rheumatic heart diseases (US $ 4710.78). Most direct medical costs were spent on medication. By the end of 2030, the average cost per visit per month for all CVDs was estimated to be US $ 4042.68 (95% CI: US $ 3795.04–4290.31) for all CVDs, and the total health expenditure for CVDs would reach over US $1.12 billion (95% CI: US $ 1.05–1.19 billion) without additional government interventions.\nTotal health expenditures for CVDs in Shanghai are estimated to be higher in the future. These results should be a valuable future resource for both researchers on the economic effects of CVDs and for policy makers.","authors":["Shengnan Wang","Max Petzold","Junshan Cao","Yue Zhang"],"meta":["May 2015Medicine 94(20):e837","DOI:10.1097/MD.0000000000000837","SourcePubMed"],"references":["268228013_Impact_of_population_ageing_on_the_costs_of_hospitalisations_for_cardiovascular_disease_A_population-based_data_linkage_study","260427666_AN_OVERVIEW_ON_MICROBIAL_FIBRINOLYTIC_PROTEASES_Impact_factor189","260170895_Forecasting_the_Number_of_Human_Immunodeficiency_Virus_Infections_in_the_Korean_Population_Using_the_Autoregressive_Integrated_Moving_Average_Model","260127351_Applications_and_Comparisons_of_Four_Time_Series_Models_in_Epidemiological_Surveillance_Data","295169972_Healthy_Living_and_Mortality_among_Adults_with_Diabetes_Findings_from_the_European_Prospective_Investigation_into_Cancer_and_Nutrition-Potsdam_Study","283832736_Chinese_guidelines_for_prevention_of_cardiovascular_diseases","258636555_Costs_of_Cardiac_Care_Likely_to_Increase_Despite_Advances_in_Prevention_Care","257530927_More_Americans_Living_Longer_With_Cardiovascular_Disease_Will_Increase_Costs_While_Lowering_Quality_Of_Life","247778703_Heart_Disease_and_Stroke_Statistics-2012_Update_A_Report_From_the_American_Heart_Association","246137282_Time_Series_Analysis_Using_Autoregressive_Integrated_Moving_Average_ARIMA_Models"]}
