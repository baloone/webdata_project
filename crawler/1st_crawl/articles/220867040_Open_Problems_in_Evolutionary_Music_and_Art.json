{"id":"220867040_Open_Problems_in_Evolutionary_Music_and_Art","abstract":"Applying evolutionary methods to the generation of music and art is a relatively new field of enquiry. While there have been some important devel- opments, it might be argued that to date, successful results in this domain have been limited. Much of the present research can be characterized as finding ad- hoc methods that can produce subjectively interesting results. In this paper, it is argued that a stronger overall research plan is needed if the field is to develop in the longer term and attract more researchers. Five 'open problems' are defined and explained as broad principle areas of investigation for evolutionary music and art. Each problem is explained and the impetus and background for it is de- scribed in the context of creative evolutionary systems.","authors":["Jon McCormack"],"meta":["March 2005Lecture Notes in Computer Science 3449:428-436","DOI:10.1007/978-3-540-32003-6_43","SourceDBLP","Conference: Applications of Evolutionary Computing, EvoWorkshops 2005: EvoBIO, EvoCOMNET, EvoHOT, EvoIASP, EvoMUSART, and EvoSTOC, Lausanne, Switzerland, March 30 - April 1, 2005, Proceedings"],"references":["243785691_Artificial_creativity_A_synthetic_approach_to_the_study_of_creative_behaviour","235362665_The_Mating_Mind_How_Sexual_Choice_Shaped_the_Evolution_of_Human_Nature","215789467_Open_Problems_in_Artificial_Life","2622683_Creativity_in_Evolution_Individuals_Interactions_and_Environments","313645808_Artificial_evolution_for_computer_graphics","279237119_Homo_Aestheticus_Where_Art_Comes_From_and_Why","274046654_What_is_Art_For","272746350_Metacreation_Art_and_Artificial_Life","272746261_Emergence_and_Artificial_Life","268903420_Aesthetic_Measure","238653999_Eons_of_Genetically_Evolved_Algorithmic_Images","233820894_Homo_aesteticus_where_art_comes_from_and_why","220720947_Artificial_Evolution_for_Computer_Graphics_Computer_Graphics_25319-328","220647762_Why_Do_We_Need_Artificial_Life","201976455_Designing_Neural_Networks_Using_Genetic_Algorithms_with_Graph_Generation_System","37915579_How_far_away_are_we_from_the_first_masterpiece_of_computer_art","29451497_Creativity_Cognition_and_Knowledge_An_Interaction","2541025_Evolving_Sonic_Ecosystems"]}
