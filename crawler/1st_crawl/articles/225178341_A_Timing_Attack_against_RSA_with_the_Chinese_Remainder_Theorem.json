{"id":"225178341_A_Timing_Attack_against_RSA_with_the_Chinese_Remainder_Theorem","abstract":"We introduce a new type of timing attack which enables the factorization of an RSA-modulus if the exponentiation with the\nsecret exponent uses the Chinese Remainder Theorem and Montgomeryâ€™s algorithm. Its standard variant assumes that both exponentiations\nare carried out with a simple square and multiply algorithm. However, although its effciency decreases, our attack can also\nbe adapted to more advanced exponentiation algorithms. The previously known timing attacks do not work if the Chinese Remainder\nTheorem is used.","authors":["Werner Schindler"],"meta":["January 2000Lecture Notes in Computer Science 1965:109-124","DOI:10.1007/3-540-44499-8_8","SourceDBLP","Conference: Proceedings of the Second International Workshop on Cryptographic Hardware and Embedded Systems"],"references":["220962876_A_Practical_Implementation_of_the_Timing_Attack","2437595_Montgomery_Exponentiation_with_no_Final_Subtractions_Improved_Results","2247203_On_the_Importance_of_Checking_Cryptographic_Protocols_for_Faults","275624793_An_Introduction_to_Probability_Theory_and_Its_Applications","275624150_An_Introduction_to_Probability_Theory_and_Its_Applications","275619177_An_Introduction_To_Probability_Theory_And_Its_Applications","247077215_Optimized_Timing_Attacks_Against_Public_Key_Cryptosystems","244446876_Vanstone_Handbook_of_Applied_Cryptography","243119758_Modular_Multiplication_Without_Trial_Division","242360121_An_Introduction_to_Probability_Theory_and_its_Applications_Volume_I_II","220479017_Small_Solutions_to_Polynomial_Equations_and_Low_Exponent_RSA_Vulnerabilities","3381394_Montgomery_exponentiation_needs_no_final_subtractions","2582060_Timing_Attacks_on_Implementations_of_Diffie-Hellman_RSA_DSS_and_Other_Systems"]}
