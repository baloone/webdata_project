The findings from this project illustrate how important it is that students use a range of languages and discourses to negotiate meaning of unfamiliar terms. The article responds to Mesthrie's (2008) caution regarding the development of multilingual glossaries, dictionaries and textbooks at higher education level in South Africa. It argues that translation of terminology happens inevitably both inside and outside our university classrooms as multilingual university students, in peer learning groups, codeswitch from English to their primary languages in order to better understand new concepts and this could be used as an important resource for building academic registers in African languages.","authors":["Moragh Paxton"],"meta":["July 2009Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development 30(4):345-359","DOI:10.1080/01434630902780731"],"references":["285253881_A_language_of_teaching_dilemmas_Unlocking_the_complex_multilingual_secondary_mathematics_classroom","264655929_The_Role_of_English_in_Individual_and_Societal_Development_A_View_From_African_Classrooms","254333622_Shifting_Language_Attitudes_in_Linguistically_Diverse_Learning_Environment_in_South_Africa","249060215_Can_academicscientific_discourse_really_be_translated_across_English_and_African_languages","248974916_The_use_of_mother_tongue_and_English_in_the_learning_and_expression_of_science_concepts_A_classroom-based_study","245919622_Dialogic_Inquiry_Towards_a_Sociocultural_Practice_and_Theory_of_Education","44824023_Getting_learning_right_report_of_the_President's_Education_Initiative_PEI_Research_Project","344487020_Discourse_Strategies","292702003_Code-switching_in_a_senior_primary_class_of_second-language_mathematics_learners","270155577_Discourse_Strategies","249797669_Linguistic_Interdependence_and_the_Educational_Development_of_Bilingual_Children","233181833_Necessary_Versus_Sufficient_Conditions_for_Using_New_Languages_in_South_African_Higher_Education_A_Linguistic_Appraisal1","44455032_Social_Linguistics_and_Literacies_Ideology_In_Discourses"]}
