{"id":"341231374_Developing_a_Shared_Vision_for_Change_Moving_toward_Inclusive_Empowerment","abstract":"Shared vision is an important process for change projects, serving to amplify success, increase participation, and erode the divide between project leaders and constituents. Yet there are few empirical examinations of the process of building shared vision within academic departments. Using focus groups and participant observation, this study examines shared vision development within 13 large-scale change projects in engineering and computer science higher education. We find that teams of faculty, staff, administrators, and students built shared vision with stakeholders through co-orientation, formational communication, and recognition of stakeholder autonomy. Our results delineate practices for developing shared vision for academic change projects and demonstrate the benefits of inclusive stakeholder empowerment.","authors":["Kerice Doten-Snitker","Cara Margherio","Elizabeth Litzler","Ella Ingram"],"meta":["March 2021Research in Higher Education 62(3)","DOI:10.1007/s11162-020-09594-9"],"references":["331559807_NSF_ADVANCE_and_gender_equity_Past_present_and_future_of_systemic_institutional_transformation_strategies","324850641_Successful_Organizational_Change_Integrating_the_Management_Practice_and_Scholarly_Literatures","324565677_A_dynamic_phase_model_of_psychological_contract_processes","321505207_Advancing_inclusive_science_and_systemic_change_The_convergence_of_national_aims_and_institutional_goals_in_implementing_and_assessing_biomedical_science_training","318360449_Faculty_drivers_and_barriers_laying_the_groundwork_for_undergraduate_STEM_education_reform_in_academic_departments","339380585_A_Dictionary_of_Media_and_Communication","327314978_How_Colleges_Change_Understanding_Leading_and_Enacting_Change","324096092_Anatomy_of_STEM_teaching_in_North_American_universities","313754108_Grounded_theory","313200645_Institutionalized_organizations_Formal_structure_as_myth_and_ceremony","313080007_Collaborative_governance_in_theory_and_practice","312225697_Shifting_the_grounds_Constructivist_grounded_theory_methods","298941254_The_Problem_of_the_Psychological_Contract_Considered","292356631_Sensemaking_and_sensegiving_in_strategic_change_initiation","291615203_Ethical_Perspectives_on_Employee_Participation_in_Planned_Organizational_Change"]}
