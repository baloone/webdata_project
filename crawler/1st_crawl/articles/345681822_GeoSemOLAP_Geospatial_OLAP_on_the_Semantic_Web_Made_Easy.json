{"id":"345681822_GeoSemOLAP_Geospatial_OLAP_on_the_Semantic_Web_Made_Easy","abstract":"The proliferation of spatial data and the publication of multidimensional (MD) data on the Semantic Web (SW) has led to new opportunities for On-Line Analytical Processing (SOLAP) over spatial data using SPARQL. However, formulating such queries results in verbose statements and can easily become very difficult for inexperienced users. Hence, we have developed GeoSemOLAP to enable users without detailed knowledge of RDF and SPARQL to query the SW with SOLAP. GeoSemOLAP generates SPARQL queries based on high-level SOLAP operators and allows the user to interactively formulate queries using a graphical interface with interactive maps.","authors":["Nurefsan GÃ¼r","Jacob Nielsen","Katja Hose","Torben Bach Pedersen"],"meta":["April 2017","DOI:10.1145/3041021.3054731","Conference: the 26th International Conference"],"references":["267861711_Data_Models_and_Query_Languages_for_Linked_Geospatial_Data","221103157_Highly_Scalable_Trip_Grouping_for_Large_Scale_Collective_Transportation_Systems","317056259_A_foundation_for_spatial_data_warehouses_on_the_Semantic_Web","310900390_Enabling_Spatial_OLAP_Over_Environmental_and_Farming_Data_with_QB4SOLAP","283846932_Publishing_Danish_Agricultural_Government_Data_as_Semantic_Web_Data","255787469_When_Spatial_Analysis_Meets_OLAP_Multidimensional_Model_and_Operators"]}
