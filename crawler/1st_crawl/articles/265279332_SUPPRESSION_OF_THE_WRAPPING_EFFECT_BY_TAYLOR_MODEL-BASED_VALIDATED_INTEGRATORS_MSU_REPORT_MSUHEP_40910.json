{"id":"265279332_SUPPRESSION_OF_THE_WRAPPING_EFFECT_BY_TAYLOR_MODEL-BASED_VALIDATED_INTEGRATORS_MSU_REPORT_MSUHEP_40910","abstract":"The validated integration of ranges of initial conditons through ODEs faces two major challenges, namely the precise representation of the flow over the short term, and the avoidance of unfavorable buildup of errors in the long term. We discuss methods for meeting those challenges within the framework of Taylor model methods, in which the dependence on initial con-ditions is expressed by a high-order multivariate polynomial and a remainder bound. Numerous examples of the performance of the methods and compar-isons to other approaches are given.","authors":["Kyoko Makino","Martin Berz"],"meta":[],"references":["247699712_Taylor_models_and_other_validated_functional_inclusion_methods","228919342_COSY_INFINITY_version_81_programming_manual","2304159_Where_Is_Validated_ODE_Solving_Going","2270308_Remainder_Differential_Algebras_and_Their_Applications","267093769_Preservation_of_canonical_structure_in_non-planar_curvilinear_coordinates","266228243_Perturbative_equations_of_motion_and_differential_operators_in_non-planar_curvilinear_coordinates","266168237_Reducing_the_Wrapping_Effect","265709263_Computation_of_Guaranteed_Enclosures_for_the_Solutions_of_Ordinary_Initial_and_Boundary_Value_Problems","265445281_Local_theory_and_applications_of_extended_generating_functions","256391773_Survey_of_interval_algorithms_for_ordinary_differential_equations","248685873_Interval_Arithmetic_Error-Bounding_Algorithms","247410362_Rigorous_analysis_of_nonlinear_motion_in_particle_accelerators","245036605_A_heuristic_to_reduce_the_wrapping_effect_in_the_numerical_solution_of_x'_f_t_x","243787612_New_Applications_of_Taylor_Model_Methods","243774305_The_Solution_of_Initial_Value_Problems_Using_Interval_Arithmetic","243095886_Logarithmic_Reduction_of_the_Wrapping_Effect_with_Application_to_Ordinary_Differential_Equations","237128579_Circumscribing_an_Ellipsoid_about_the_Intersection_of_Two_Ellipsoids","230606107_Automatic_local_coordinate_transformations_to_reduce_the_growth_of_error_bounds_in_interval_computation_of_solutions_of_ordinary_differential_equations","230605921_Enclosing_the_solutions_of_ordinary_initial_and_boundary_value_problems","222683172_Taylor_models_and_floating-point_arithmetic_Proof_that_arithmetic_operations_are_validated_in_COSY","220791885_Monotonically_Convergent_Numerical_Two-sided_Bounds_for_a_Differential_Birth_and_Death_Process","220561005_Validated_Solutions_of_Initial_Value_Problems_for_Ordinary_Differential_Equations","220261624_Rigorously_Computed_Orbits_of_Dynamical_Systems_without_the_Wrapping_Effect","220253008_Controlling_the_Wrapping_Effect_in_the_Solution_of_ODEs_for_Asteroids","220252961_New_Methods_for_High-Dimensional_Verified_Quadrature","220252899_Efficient_Control_of_the_Dependency_Problem_Based_on_Taylor_Model_Methods","220252838_Verified_Integration_of_ODEs_and_Flows_Using_Differential_Algebraic_Methods_on_High-Order_Taylor_Models","11813767_Optimal_Symplectic_Approximation_of_Hamiltonian_Flows","2657068_The_Wrapping_Effect_Ellipsoid_Arithmetic_Stability_and_Confidence_Regions","2644362_Computing_Rigorous_Bounds_on_the_Solution_of_an_Initial_Value_Problem_for_an_Ordinary_Differential_Equation"]}
