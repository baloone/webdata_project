{"id":"354094460_Self-Directedness_for_Sustainable_Learning_in_University_Studies_Lithuanian_Students'_Perspective","abstract":"The paper analyzes Lithuanian students’ preparedness for sustainable learning from the perspective of self-directedness. The data for the study were collected using a questionnaire that explored students’ perceptions in line with ten indicators of self-directed learning. The research sample (n = 309) was composed of the third and fourth year undergraduates accomplishing their degrees in various areas of studies. The data analysis revealed how students perceive their readiness for sustainable learning. Goal setting, technical readiness, time management, procrastination management, exam preparation and stress management indicators were analysed in detail in order to determine which variables had the most significant impact on these indicators. The study revealed that the students are only partially prepared for sustainable learning at the university. Even though they have the necessary digital competencies that allow for effective involvement in the learning process, the data revealed that they are prone to procrastination. The results also showed that the students perceived themselves to be the least competent in stress management and procrastination management.","authors":["Nijolė Burkšaitienė","Robert Lescinskij","Jelena Suchanova","Jolita Šliogerienė"],"meta":["August 2021Sustainability 13(16):9467","DOI:10.3390/su13169467"],"references":["352504230_Lithuanian_undergraduate_students'_approaches_to_learning_English_for_Specific_Purposes","349212243_The_Transformation_of_Higher_Education_After_the_COVID_Disruption_Emerging_Challenges_in_an_Online_Learning_Scenario","347290241_Examining_Procrastination_among_University_Students_through_the_Lens_of_the_Self-Regulated_Learning_Model","341834486_Examining_Student_Perception_of_Readiness_for_Online_Learning_Importance_and_Confidence","340720226_The_Impact_of_the_Covid-19_Pandemic_on_Current_Anatomy_Education_and_Future_Careers_A_Student's_Perspective","350732198_Comparative_Analysis_of_Student's_Live_Online_Learning_Readiness_During_the_Coronavirus_COVID-19_Pandemic_in_the_Higher_Education_Sector","349188765_A_Comprehensive_Overview_of_Online_Education_-_Impact_on_Engineering_Students_during_COVID-19","347231946_Investigation_and_Analysis_of_Learning_Anxiety_for_Online_Teaching_in_Universities_and_Colleges_under_the_Epidemic_Situation","343930500_The_Impact_of_COVID-19_on_Student_Experiences_and_Expectations_Evidence_from_a_Survey","341412627_What_the_student_does_Teaching_for_enhanced_learning"]}
