{"id":"340534950_Evolving-Controllers_Versus_Learning-Controllers_for_Morphologically_Evolvable_Robots","abstract":"We investigate an evolutionary robot system where (simulated) modular robots can reproduce and create robot children that inherit the parentsâ€™ morphologies by crossover and mutation. Within this system we compare two approaches to creating good controllers, i.e., evolution only and evolution plus learning. In the first one the controller of a robot child is inherited, so that it is produced by applying crossover and mutation to the controllers of its parents. In the second one the controller of the child is also inherited, but additionally, it is enhanced by a learning method. The experiments show that the learning approach does not only lead to different fitness levels, but also to different (bigger) robots. This constitutes a quantitative demonstration that changes in brains, i.e., controllers, can induce changes in the bodies, i.e., morphologies.","authors":["Karine Miras","Matteo De Carlo","Sayfeddine Akhatou","A.
