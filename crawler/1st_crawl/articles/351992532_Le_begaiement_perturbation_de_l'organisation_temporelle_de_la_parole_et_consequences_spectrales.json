{"id":"351992532_Le_begaiement_perturbation_de_l'organisation_temporelle_de_la_parole_et_consequences_spectrales","abstract":"Stuttering is a communication disorder characterised, among other factors, by a momentary loss of control of speech gestures, thus provoking more specific and more frequent disfluences, compared with non stutterers. In the current investigation, particular attention is paid, firstly, to the study of intrasegmental parameters (V. O. T. And V. T. T. ) in order to characterise the timing of stutterersâ€™ productions. Speech rate is also varied for control speakers, stutterers and former stutterers. Secondly, Laryngeal Reaction Time (LRT) was studied during disfluences. Unusual configurations of the glottis are also described. Finally, a study of the formant structure of vowels was carried out to see if there was vowel reduction for stutterers compared with control speakers and former stutterers.","authors":["Fabrice Hirsch"],"meta":["December 2007","Advisor: Rudolph Sock"],"references":[]}
