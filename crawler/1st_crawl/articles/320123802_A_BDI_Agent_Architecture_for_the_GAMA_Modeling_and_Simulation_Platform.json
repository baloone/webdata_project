{"id":"320123802_A_BDI_Agent_Architecture_for_the_GAMA_Modeling_and_Simulation_Platform","abstract":"With the increase of computing power and the development of user-friendly multi-agent simulation frameworks, social simulations have become increasingly realistic. However, most agent architectures in these simulations use simple reactive models. Indeed, cognitive agent architectures face two main obstacles: their complexity for the field-expert modeler, and their computational cost. In this paper, we propose a new cognitive agent architecture based on the BDI (Belief-Desire-Intention) paradigm integrated into the GAMA modeling platform and its GAML modeling language. This architecture was designed to be simple-to-use for modelers, flexible enough to manage complex behaviors, and with low computational cost. An experiment carried out with different profiles of end-users shows that the architecture is actually usable even by modelers who have little knowledge in programming and in Artificial Intelligence.","authors":["Patrick Taillandier","Mathieu Bourgais","Philippe Caillou","Carole A Adam"],"meta":["September 2017","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-67477-3_1","Conference: International Workshop on Multi-Agent Systems and Agent-Based Simulation","Project: ACTEUR"],"references":["320179692_A_simple-to-use_BDI_architecture_for_agent-based_modeling_and_simulation","315330288_A_Simple-to-Use_BDI_Architecture_for_Agent-Based_Modeling_and_Simulation","306074863_BDI_agents_in_social_simulations_a_survey","287362915_OpenSim_A_framework_for_integrating_agent-based_models_and_simulation_components","287029533_How_Do_Agents_Make_Decisions_A_Survey","259679423_GAMA_16_Advancing_the_Art_of_Complex_Agent-Based_Modeling_and_Simulation","259679093_A_New_BDI_Architecture_To_Formalize_Cognitive_Agent_Behaviors_Into_Simulations","246572281_JACK_Intelligent_Agents_-_Summary_of_an_Agent_Infrastructure","271154070_Intention_Plans_and_Practical_Reason","244436493_NetLogo_Center_for_connected_learning_and_computer-based_modeling"]}
