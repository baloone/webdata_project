{"id":"353998081_Protocol_for_simulating_macrophage_signal_transduction_and_phenotype_polarization_using_a_large-scale_mechanistic_computational_model","abstract":"The ability to measure and analyze the complex dynamic multi-marker features of macrophages is critical for the understanding of their diverse phenotypes and functions in health and disease. To that end, we have recently developed a multi-pathway computational model that for the first time enables a systems-level characterization of macrophage signaling and activation from quantitative, temporal, dose-dependent, and single-cell aspects. This protocol includes instructions to utilize this model to computationally explore different biological scenarios with high resolution and efficiency.\nFor complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Zhao et al.
