{"id":"30013012_Circle_Segments_A_Technique_for_Visually_Exploring_Large_Multidimensional_Data_Sets","abstract":"In this paper, we describe a novel technique for visualizing large amounts of high-dimensional data, called circle segments. The technique uses one colored pixel per data value and can therefore be classified as a pixel-per-value technique [Kei 96]. The basic idea of the circle segments visualization technique is to display the data dimensions as segments of a circle. If the data consists of k dimensions, the circle is partitioned into k segments, each representing one data dimension. Inside the segments, the data values belonging to one dimension are arranged from the center of the circle to the outside in a back and forth manner orthogonal to the line that halves the segment. Our first results show that the circle segment technique is very powerful for visualizing large amounts of data, providing more expressive visualizations than other wellknown techniques such as the recursive pattern technique and traditional line graphs.","authors":["Mihael Ankerst","Daniel A.
