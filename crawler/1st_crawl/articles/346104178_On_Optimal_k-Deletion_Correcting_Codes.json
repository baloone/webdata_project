{"id":"346104178_On_Optimal_k-Deletion_Correcting_Codes","abstract":"Levenshtein introduced the problem of constructing k-deletion correcting codes in 1966, proved that the optimal redundancy of those codes is O(k logN) for constant k, and proposed an optimal redundancy single-deletion correcting code (using the so-called VT construction). However, the problem of constructing optimal redundancy k-deletion correcting codes remained open. Our key contribution is a major step towards a complete solution to this longstanding open problem for constant k. We present a k-deletion correcting code that has redundancy 8k logN + o(logN) when k = o(âˆšlog logN) and encoding/decoding algorithms of complexity O(N2k+1).","authors":["Jin Sima","Jehoshua Bruck"],"meta":["October 2020IEEE Transactions on Information Theory PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TIT.2020.3028702"],"references":["338437829_Optimal_Document_Exchange_and_New_Codes_for_Insertions_and_Deletions"]}
