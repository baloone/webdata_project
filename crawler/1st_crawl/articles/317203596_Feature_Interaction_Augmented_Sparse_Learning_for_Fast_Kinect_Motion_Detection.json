{"id":"317203596_Feature_Interaction_Augmented_Sparse_Learning_for_Fast_Kinect_Motion_Detection","abstract":"The Kinect sensing devices have been widely used in current HCI entertainment. A fundamental issue involved is to detect usersâ€™ motions accurately and quickly. In this paper, we tackle it by proposing a linear algorithm which is augmented by feature interaction. The linear property guarantees its speed whereas feature interaction captures the higher-order effect from the data to enhance its accuracy. The Schatten-p norm is leveraged to integrate the main linear effect and the higher-order nonlinear effect by mining the correlation between them. The resulted classification model is a desirable combination of speed and accuracy. We propose a novel solution to solve our objective function. Experiments are performed on three public Kinect-based entertainment datasets related to fitness and gaming. The results show that our method has its advantage for motion detection in a real-time Kinect entertaining environment.","authors":["Xiaojun Chang","Zhigang Ma","Ming Lin","Yi Yang"],"meta":["May 2017IEEE Transactions on Image Processing PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TIP.2017.2708506"],"references":["310824906_Multi-Task_Feature_Interaction_Learning","307516516_Human_action_recognition_based_on_3D_skeleton_part-based_pose_estimation_and_temporal_multi-resolution_analysis","301879735_Learning_a_Pose_Lexicon_for_Semantic_Action_Recognition","287095179_Low-rank_matrix_recovery_via_efficient_schatten_p-norm_minimization","280630694_Multimodal_Multipart_Learning_for_Action_Recognition_in_Depth_Videos","268747996_Semisupervised_Feature_Analysis_by_Mining_Correlations_Among_Multiple_Tasks","266660364_An_Efficient_Algorithm_For_Weak_Hierarchical_Lasso","261110069_A_Decision_Forest_Based_Feature_Selection_Framework_for_Action_Recognition_from_RGB-Depth_Cameras","258817757_A_General_Iterative_Shrinkage_and_Thresholding_Algorithm_for_Non-convex_Regularized_Optimization_Problems","224135290_RACKET_Real-time_autonomous_computation_of_kinematic_elements_in_tennis","49697914_Learning_a_3D_Human_Pose_Distance_Metric_from_Geometric_Pose_Descriptor","32205904_Joint_covariate_selection_and_joint_subspace_selection_for_multiple_classification_problems","311611187_Mining_3D_Key-Pose-Motifs_for_Action_Recognition","310416523_Skeleton_Optical_Spectra_Based_Action_Recognition_Using_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","308859248_Action_recognition_using_joint_coordinates_of_3D_skeleton_data","308516323_Semantic_Pooling_for_Complex_Event_Analysis_in_Untrimmed_Videos","307584712_Stochastic_CoSaMP_Randomizing_Greedy_Pursuit_for_Sparse_Signal_Recovery","307434418_Learning_a_pose_lexicon_for_semantic_action_recognition","305867060_Hierarchical_recurrent_neural_network_for_skeleton_based_action_recognition","303694953_Lower_Limb_Action_Recognition_with_Motion_Data_of_a_Human_Joint","299474477_Bi-Level_Semantic_Representation_Analysis_for_Multimedia_Event_Detection","278625551_Action_Recognition_Using_Rate-Invariant_Analysis_of_Skeletal_Shape_Trajectories","270220684_Robust_Action_Recognition_via_Borrowing_Information_Across_Video_Modalities","266838683_Combining_unsupervised_learning_and_discrimination_for_3D_action_recognition","264958335_An_Introduction_to_Linear_Regression_Analysis","264741841_Accurate_3D_Action_Recognition_using_Learning_on_the_Grassmann_Manifold","262323665_A_Tai_Chi_Training_System_Based_on_Fast_Skeleton_Matching_Algorithm","261504390_G3D_A_gaming_action_dataset_and_real_time_action_recognition_evaluation_framework","247866275_The_Elements_of_Statistical_Learning_Springer","242358078_The_Elements_Of_Statistical_Learning","236687778_Regularized_M-estimators_With_Nonconvexity_Statistical_and_Algorithmic_Theory_for_Local_Optima","227369323_Variable_Selection_Using_Adaptive_Nonlinear_Interaction_Structures_in_High_Dimensions","221700463_A_Proximal-Gradient_Homotopy_Method_for_the_Sparse_Least-Squares_Problem","221345464_Gradient_descent_with_sparsification_An_iterative_algorithm_for_sparse_recovery_with_restricted_isometry_property","2885544_Online_Convex_Programming_and_Generalized_Infinitesimal_Gradient_Ascent"]}
