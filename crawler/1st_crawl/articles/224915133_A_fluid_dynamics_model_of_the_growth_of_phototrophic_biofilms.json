{"id":"224915133_A_fluid_dynamics_model_of_the_growth_of_phototrophic_biofilms","abstract":"A system of nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equations is derived using mixture theory to model the formation of biofilms. In contrast with most of the existing models, our equations have a finite speed of propagation, without using artificial free boundary conditions. Adapted numerical scheme will be described in detail and several simulations will be presented in one and more space dimensions in the particular case of cyanobacteria biofilms. Besides, the numerical scheme we present is able to deal in a natural and effective way with regions where one of the phases is vanishing.","authors":["Fabrizio Clarelli","Cristiana Di Russo","Roberto Natalini","Magali Ribot"],"meta":["May 2012Journal of Mathematical Biology 66(7)","DOI:10.1007/s00285-012-0538-5","SourcePubMed","Project: Fluid dynamic models of biofilm"],"references":["290824975_Mathematical_Modeling_of_Biofilms","267951238_Phase-Field_Models_for_Biofilms_II_2-D_Numerical_Simulations_of_Biofilm-Flow_Interaction","267187154_Numerical_Solution_of_the_Navier-Stokes_Equations","303076834_Numerical_solution_of_the_Navier-Stokes_equation","295736587_Navier-Stokes_Equations_Theory_and_Numerical_Analysis","284588849_Competition_in_Biofilms","266364682_Discrete_Kinetic_Schemes_for_Systems_of_Conservation_Laws","265562597_Mechanics_of_Mixtures","265366169_Une_methode_d'aproximation_de_la_solution_des_equations_de_Navier-Stokes","257364962_Navier-Stokes_Equations_Theory_and_Numerical_Analysis_Revised_Edition"]}
