Areas of high inter-pathologist discordance and rising biopsy rates necessitate higher efficiency and diagnostic reproducibility. We present and validate a deep learning system which classifies digitized dermatopathology slides into 4 categories. The system is developed using 5,070 images from a single lab, and tested on an uncurated set of 13,537 images from 3 test labs, using whole slide scanners manufactured by 3 different vendors. The systemâ€™s use of deep-learning-based confidence scoring as a criterion to consider the result as accurate yields an accuracy of up to 98%, and makes it adoptable in a real-world setting. Without confidence scoring, the system achieved an accuracy of 78%. We anticipate that our deep learning system will serve as a foundation enabling faster diagnosis of skin cancer, identification of cases for specialist review, and targeted diagnostic classifications.","authors":["Julianna Ianni","Rajath Soans","Sivaramakrishnan Sankarapandian","Ramachandra Vikas Chamarthi"],"meta":["February 2020Scientific Reports 10(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-020-59985-2"],"references":["337894715_Whole-Slide_Image_Focus_Quality_Automatic_Assessment_and_Impact_on_AI_Cancer_Detection","334473745_Clinical-grade_computational_pathology_using_weakly_supervised_deep_learning_on_whole_slide_images","333228756_End-to-end_lung_cancer_screening_with_three-dimensional_deep_learning_on_low-dose_chest_computed_tomography","332212711_Development_and_Validation_of_a_Deep_Learning-Based_Automated_Detection_Algorithm_for_Major_Thoracic_Diseases_on_Chest_Radiographs","331229103_Classification_of_Melanocytic_Lesions_in_Selected_and_Whole-Slide_Images_via_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","340387240_Hidden_Stratification_Causes_Clinically_Meaningful_Failures_in_Machine_Learning_for_Medical_Imaging","338472877_Automated_deep-learning_system_for_Gleason_grading_of_prostate_cancer_using_biopsies_a_diagnostic_study","335332567_Quantifying_the_effects_of_data_augmentation_and_stain_color_normalization_in_convolutional_neural_networks_for_computational_pathology","334428173_Ink_Removal_from_Histopathology_Whole_Slide_Images_by_Combining_Classification_Detection_and_Image_Generation_Models","332459352_HistoQC_An_Open-Source_Quality_Control_Tool_for_Digital_Pathology_Slides"]}
