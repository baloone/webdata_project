{"id":"329036230_Summary_of_Propagation_Cases_of_the_Second_AIAA_Sonic_Boom_Prediction_Workshop","abstract":"A summary is provided for the propagation portion of the second AIAA Sonic Boom Prediction Workshop, held 8 January 2017 in conjunction with the AIAA SciTech 2017 Conference. Near-field pressure waveforms for two cases were supplied, and ground signatures at multiple azimuthal angles as well as their corresponding loudness metrics were requested from 10 participants, representing three countries. Each case had some required as well as some optional runs. The required cases included atmospheric profiles with measured data including winds, using radiosonde balloon data at multiple geographically spread locations. The humidity profiles provided for the optional cases were taken from American National Standards Institute guidance. Participants provided ground signatures along with the requested data, including some loudness metrics using their best practices, which included lossy as well as lossless atmospheric propagation schemes. All the participants’ submissions, for each case, are compared and discussed. Noise or loudness measures are calculated, and detailed comparisons and statistical analyses are performed and presented. It has been observed that the variation in the loudness measures and spread between participants’ submissions increased as the computation proceeded from undertrack locations toward the lateral cutoff. Lessons learned during this workshop are discussed, and recommendations are made for potential improvements and possible subsequent workshops.","authors":["Sriram K Rallabhandi","Alexandra Loubeau"],"meta":["November 2018Journal of Aircraft 56(3):1-20","DOI:10.2514/1.C034805"],"references":["299645164_Under-Track_CFD-Based_Shape_Optimization_for_a_Low-Boom_Demonstrator_Concept","24302278_Multilevel_Error_Estimation_and_Adaptive_h-Refinement_for_Cartesian_Meshes_with_Embedded_Boundaries","4707388_Adjoint_Formulation_for_an_Embedded-Boundary_Cartesian_Method","2486897_Robust_and_Efficient_Cartesian_Mesh_Generation_for_Component-Based_Geometry","318169380_Propagation_Summary_of_the_Second_AIAA_Sonic_Boom_Prediction_Workshop","268557992_Advanced_Concept_Studies_for_Supersonic_Commercial_Transports_Entering_Service_in_2030-35_N3","241343294_Overview_of_the_Integrated_Global_Radiosonde_Archive","232489551_Perceived_level_of_noise_by_Mark_VII_and_DecibelsE","11522874_Summary_of_recent_NASA_studies_of_human_response_to_sonic_booms"]}
