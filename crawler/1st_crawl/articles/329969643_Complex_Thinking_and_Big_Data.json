{"id":"329969643_Complex_Thinking_and_Big_Data","abstract":"Increased knowledge in many areas begins to destabilise the background way of thinking of the classical science - the reductionist thinking. Changing the paradigm towards the science of complexity and complex thinking is difficult, as our systems of research and education are not prepared for these changes, although complex thinking seems to be inherent to the mankind. Big data analytics, from computer science, may provide the methodological framework for practicing the science of complexity and help us to change our way of thinking.","authors":["Cient Periodique","Ljiljana Majnaric"],"meta":["January 2018"],"references":["221784528_Systems_biology_as_a_conceptual_framework_for_research_in_family_medicine_Use_in_predicting_response_to_influenza_vaccination","44569256_Relations_Between_Inductive_Reasoning_and_Deductive_Reasoning","14577072_Non-linear_dynamics_for_clinicians_Chaos_theory_fractals_and_complexity_at_the_bedside","11493867_Dynamics_of_Stability_The_Physiologic_Basis_of_Functional_Health_and_Frailty"]}
