{"id":"324286550_Novel_Hybrid_Encryption_Algorithm_Based_on_Aes_RSA_and_Twofish_for_Bluetooth_Encryption","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a novel triple algorithm based on RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman), AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), and TwoFish in order to further improve the security of Bluetooth that is currently using only 128-bit AES for encryption in its latest versions (Bluetooth 4.0–5.0). Furthermore, older Bluetooth 1.0A–3.0+HS (High-Speed) devices use E0 stream cipher for encryption that has been shown to be weak by numerous researchers and thus it can be considered insufficient for high security purposes nowadays. In our novel approach, we first encrypt the message by using AES with 128-bit key and then further encrypt it by using TwoFish with the same 128-bit key. Finally, the 128-bit key generated in the beginning will be encrypted by using RSA with 1024 -bit key to protect its over-the-air transfer. In the receiving end, the decryption process goes in reverse order compared with encryption process. We will show with experimental figures that our novel algorithm significantly improves the security of Bluetooth encryption by eliminating all known weaknesses and thus making data exchange between Bluetooth devices secure.","authors":["Marwan Albahar","Olayemi Olawumi","Keijo Haataja","Pekka Toivanen"],"meta":["April 2018Journal of Information Security 09(02):168-176","DOI:10.4236/jis.2018.92012"],"references":["328718368_A_Performance_Analysis_of_DES_and_RSA_Cryptography","278329872_An_Information_Security_Technique_Using_DES-RSA_Hybrid_and_LSB","323847018_Toward_Enhancing_Just_Works_Model_in_Bluetooth_Pairing","316794072_Bluetooth_Security_Attacks","283176041_A_Review_and_Comparative_Analysis_of_Various_Encryption_Algorithms","269666690_Implementation_of_Modified_Twofish_Algorithm_using_128_and_192-bit_keys_on_VHDL","258790080_A_Study_of_Encryption_Algorithms_RSA_DES_3DES_and_AES_for_Information_Security","257523056_The_Advanced_Encryption_Standard","243772991_Cryptography_and_Network_Security_Principles_And_Practices","224128282_AES_and_Confidentiality_from_the_inside_out"]}
