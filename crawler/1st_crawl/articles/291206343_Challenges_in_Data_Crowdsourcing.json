{"id":"291206343_Challenges_in_Data_Crowdsourcing","abstract":"Crowdsourcing refers to solving large problems by involving human workers that solve component sub-problems or tasks. In data crowdsourcing, the problem involves data acquisition, management, and analysis. In this paper, we provide an overview of data crowdsourcing, giving examples of problems that the authors have tackled, and presenting the key design steps involved in implementing a crowdsourced solution. We also discuss some of the open challenges that remain to be solved.","authors":["Hector Garcia-Molina","Manas Joglekar","Adam Marcus","Aditya Parameswaran"],"meta":["April 2016IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering 28(4):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TKDE.2016.2518669"],"references":["308030070_On_Optimality_of_Jury_Selection_in_Crowdsourcing","300590392_QASCA_A_Quality-Aware_Task_Assignment_System_for_Crowdsourcing_Applications","279191951_The_Importance_of_Being_Expert_Efficient_Max-Finding_in_Crowdsourcing","268227216_Comprehensive_and_Reliable_Crowd_Assessment_Algorithms","266797712_Expert_Crowdsourcing_with_Flash_Teams","262211351_Efficient_crowdsourcing_for_multi-class_labeling","241770688_Active_sampling_for_entity_matching","230859375_Active_Learning_for_Crowd-Sourced_Databases","228057515_Human_Powered_Sorts_and_Joins","225900084_Familiarity_and_pop-out_in_visual_search","221654367_Get_Another_Label_Improving_Data_Quality_and_Data_Mining_Using_Multiple_Noisy_Labelers","221517483_Crwodsourcing_User_Studies_With_Mechanical_Turk","221212888_CrowdDB_Answering_queries_with_crowdsourcing","220898556_Sorting_and_Selection_with_Imprecise_Comparisons","220878737_Collaboratively_Crowdsourcing_Workflows_with_Turkomatic","308328437_Efficient_crowdsourcing_for_multi-class_labeling","305513125_tDP_An_Optimal-Latency_Budget_Allocation_Strategy_for_Crowdsourced_MAXIMUM_Operations","304114040_Game_Theory_and_Incentives_in_Human_Computation_Systems","303508314_AutoMan_A_Platform_for_Integrating_Human-Based_and_Digital_Computation","300590390_Minimizing_Efforts_in_Validating_Crowd_Answers","299970709_Debiasing_Crowdsourced_Batches","296951382_Hear_the_Whole_Story_Towards_the_Diversity_of_Opinion_in_Crowdsourcing_Markets","292989631_Surpassing_Humans_and_Computers_with_JellyBean_Crowd-Vision-Hybrid_Counting_Algorithms","290653954_KATARA_Reliable_data_cleaning_with_knowledge_bases_and_crowdsourcing","287959764_Crowdsourced_Data_Management_Industry_and_Academic_Perspectives","286956325_Chimera_Large-scale_classification_using_machine_learning_rules_and_crowdsourcing","282936811_Entity_Resolution_with_crowd_errors","282902897_Cleaning_uncertain_data_with_a_noisy_crowd","276549329_Hear_the_whole_story","276465155_Chimera","276465050_Optimal_crowd-powered_rating_and_filtering_algorithms","269306191_Crowd-powered_find_algorithms","266656566_DataSift_A_crowd-powered_search_toolkit","266293213_Crowdsourcing_for_Human_Subjects_Research","262389183_Leveraging_transitive_relations_for_crowdsourced_joins","262329176_WiseMarket_a_new_paradigm_for_managing_wisdom_of_online_social_users","262329079_Using_the_crowd_for_top-k_and_group-by_queries","262318488_An_Overview_of_the_Deco_System_Data_Model_and_Query_Language_Query_Processing_and_Optimization","262160318_Question_selection_for_crowd_entity_resolution","261495438_Crowdsourced_enumeration_queries","254008835_Max_algorithms_in_crowdsourcing_environments","254006782_CrowdScreen_Algorithms_for_filtering_data_with_humans","241623563_So_who_won_Dynamic_max_discovery_with_the_crowd","230639500_CrowdER_Crowdsourcing_Entity_Resolution","230609878_Whom_to_Ask_Jury_Selection_for_Decision_Making_Tasks_on_Micro-blogServices","221348053_CAPTCHA_using_hard_AI_problems_for_security","221345960_Active_Learning_from_Crowds","220988124_Crowdsourced_Databases_Query_Processing_with_People","220877275_The_jabberwocky_programming_environment_for_structured_social_computing","220877172_TurKit_Human_Computation_Algorithms_on_Mechanical_Turk","220877060_CrowdForge_Crowdsourcing_Complex_Work","220876893_Soylent_A_Word_Processor_with_a_Crowd_Inside","220696130_Collaborative_Web_Search_Who_What_Where_When_and_Why","220420650_Designing_games_with_a_purpose","200504210_Cheap_and_Fast_-_But_is_it_Good_Evaluating_Non-Expert_Annotations_for_Natural_Language_Tasks_EMNLP'08"]}
