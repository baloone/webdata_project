{"id":"326343913_New_Results_on_Impulsive_Cohen-Grossberg_Neural_Networks","abstract":"This paper is concerned with an impulsive Cohen–Grossberg neural networks with mixed delays. Under proper conditions, we studied the existence, the uniqueness and the global exponential stability of asymptotic almost automorphic solutions for the suggested system. Our method was mainly based on the Banach’s fixed point theorem, the generalized Gronwall–Bellman inequality and the Lyapunov functional method. Moreover, two examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed findings.","authors":["Chaouki Aouiti","Farah Dridi"],"meta":["June 2019Neural Processing Letters 49(1)","DOI:10.1007/s11063-018-9880-y"],"references":["323672016_Piecewise_asymptotically_almost_automorphic_solutions_for_impulsive_non-autonomous_high-order_Hopfield_neural_networks_with_mixed_delays","322227437_Stability_and_Hopf_Bifurcation_of_Fractional-Order_Complex-Valued_Single_Neuron_Model_with_Time_Delay","323700752_Hopf_bifurcation_analysis_of_a_complex-valued_neural_network_model_with_discrete_and_distributed_delays","322912746_Dynamics_and_oscillations_of_generalized_high-order_Hopfield_Neural_Networks_with_mixed_delays","322204109_Existence_and_global_exponential_stability_of_pseudo_almost_periodic_solution_for_neutral_delay_BAM_neural_networks_with_time-varying_delay_in_leakage_terms","321739556_State_Estimation_for_Quaternion-Valued_Neural_Networks_With_Multiple_Time_Delays","321473504_Fixed-time_stabilization_of_impulsive_Cohen-Grossberg_BAM_neural_networks","321291345_Impulsive_generalised_high-order_Recurrent_Neural_Networks_with_mixed_delays_Stability_and_periodicity","321270744_Impulsive_Cohen-Grossberg_BAM_neural_networks_with_mixed_time-delays_An_exponential_stability_analysis_issue","321163530_Global_exponential_stability_of_memristive_Cohen-Grossberg_neural_networks_with_mixed_delays_and_impulse_time_window","319891176_Sampled-data-based_lag_synchronization_of_chaotic_delayed_neural_networks_with_impulsive_control","316873499_Finite_time_boundedness_of_neutral_high-order_Hopfield_neural_networks_with_time_delay_in_the_leakage_term_and_mixed_time_delays","315964767_Asymptotic_Stability_of_Cohen-Grossberg_BAM_Neutral_Type_Neural_Networks_with_Distributed_Time_Varying_Delays","318848695_Razumikhin-type_theorems_for_time-delay_systems_with_Persistent_impulses","318551233_Effects_of_variable-time_impulses_on_global_exponential_stability_of_Cohen-Grossberg_neural_networks"]}
