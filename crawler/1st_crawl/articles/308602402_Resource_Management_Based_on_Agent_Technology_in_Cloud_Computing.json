{"id":"308602402_Resource_Management_Based_on_Agent_Technology_in_Cloud_Computing","abstract":"Cloud computing is a new concept which combines different technologies like: service oriented architecture, distributed computing, virtualization... It represents a model used to deliver IT capabilities. In cloud computing, everything is provided as a service. We distinguish three main services: Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). The management of cloud computing resources in IaaS level is a very difficult task to achieve for the service provider. For example, in a simple cloud computing system which is composed of one data center, we easily find thousands of physical resources that are virtualized in millions of virtual resources. So, the manager needs an automatic solution to supervise the whole system in order to avoid or to minimize the human intervention or implication. Consequently, we propose in this paper a solution to this problem based on Agent technology which can offer an automatic management of the cloud system by doing a quick adaptation once a new situation appears. This work is in fact composed of two parts: the description of the agent system and the implementation.","authors":["Taha Chaabouni","Maher Khemakhem"],"meta":["December 2013","DOI:10.1109/NOORIC.2013.78","Conference: 2013 Taibah University International Conference on Advances in Information Technology for the Holy Quran and Its Sciences","Project: PhD Thesis"],"references":["260488124_Cloud_Monitoring_definitions_issues_and_future_directions","45921163_Energy-Efficient_Management_of_Data_Center_Resources_for_Cloud_Computing_A_Vision_Architectural_Elements_and_Open_Challenges","24164535_CloudSim_A_Novel_Framework_for_Modeling_and_Simulation_of_Cloud_Computing_Infrastructures_and_Services","300335997_Agent_Based_Application_Tools_for_Cloud_Provisioning_and_Management","228819063_JADE-A_FIPA-compliant_agent_framework","224262178_Agent-Based_Cloud_Computing"]}
