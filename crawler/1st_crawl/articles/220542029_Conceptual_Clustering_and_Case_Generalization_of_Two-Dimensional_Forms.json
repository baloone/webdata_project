{"id":"220542029_Conceptual_Clustering_and_Case_Generalization_of_Two-Dimensional_Forms","abstract":"Case-based object recognition requires a general case of the object that should be detected. Real-world applications such as the recognition of biological objects in images cannot be solved by one general case. A case base is necessary to handle the great natural variations in the appearance of these objects. In this paper, we will present how to learn a hierarchical case base of general cases. We present our conceptual clustering algorithm to learn groups of similar cases from a set of acquired structural cases of fungal spores. Due to its concept description, it explicitly supplies for each cluster a generalized case and a measure for the degree of its generalization. The resulting hierarchical case base is used for applications in the field of case-based object recognition. We present results based on our application for health monitoring of biologically hazardous material.","authors":["Silke JÃ¤nichen","Petra Perner"],"meta":["August 2006Computational Intelligence 22(3-4):177-193","DOI:10.1111/j.1467-8640.2006.00282.x","SourceDBLP"],"references":["221112396_A_Buffering_Strategy_to_Avoid_Ordering_Effects_in_Clustering","220831683_Different_Learning_Strategies_in_a_Case-Based_Reasoning_System_for_Image_Interpretation","220802569_K-means_Clustering_Algorithm_for_Categorical_Attributes","220344164_Knowledge_Acquisition_Via_Incremental_Conceptual_Clustering","3421223_ITERATE_A_conceptual_clustering_algorithm_for_data_mining","2737887_Not-Yet_a_local_strategy_to_avoid_ordering_effects_in_clustering","272825865_Knowledge_Acquisition_Through_Conceptual_Clustering_A_Theoretical_Framework_and_an_Algorithm_for_Partitioning_Data_into_Conjunctive_Concepts","263242423_Knowledge_Acquisition_Via_Incremental_Conceptual_Clustering","263242270_A_New_Conceptual_Clustering_Framework","250310896_Adaptive_encoding_of_a_videoconference_image_sequence_via_neural_networks","237104340_Information_Retrieval_Data_Structures_Algorithms","224839970_Some_Methods_for_Classification_and_Analysis_of_MultiVariate_Observations","222453756_Models_of_Incremental_Concept_Formation","221345832_Ordering_Effects_in_Clustering","221203676_Incremental_Learning_of_Retrieval_Knowledge_in_a_Case-Based_Reasoning_System","220831628_Case_Acquisition_and_Case_Mining_for_Case-Based_Object_Recognition","220695912_Algorithms_for_Clustering_Data","31131452_A_General_Theory_of_Classificatory_Sorting_Strategies_1_Hierarchical_Systems","24061847_Hierarchial_Clustering_Schemes","2623804_Unsupervised_Learning_of_Probabilistic_Concept_Hierarchies"]}
