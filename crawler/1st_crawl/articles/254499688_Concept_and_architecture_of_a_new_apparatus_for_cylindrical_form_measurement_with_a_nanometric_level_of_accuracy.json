{"id":"254499688_Concept_and_architecture_of_a_new_apparatus_for_cylindrical_form_measurement_with_a_nanometric_level_of_accuracy","abstract":"In relation to the industrial need and to the progress of technology, Laboratoire National de M´etrologie et d’Essais (LNE) would like to improve the measurement of its primary pressure standards, spherical and flick standards. The spherical and flick standards are, respectively, used to calibrate the spindle motion error and the probe, which equip commercial conventional cylindricity-measuring machines. The primary pressure standards are obtained using pressure\nbalances equipped with rotary pistons. To reach a relative uncertainty of 10−6 in the pressure measurement, it is necessary to know the diameters of both the piston and the cylinder with an uncertainty of 5 nm for a piston diameter of 10 mm. Conventional machines are not able to reach such an uncertainty level. That is why the development of a new machine is necessary. The purpose of this paper is to present the concepts and the architecture adopted in the development of the new equipment dedicated to cylindricity measurement at a nanometric level of a accuracy. The choice of these concepts is based on the analysis of the uncertainty sources encountered in conventional architectures. The architecture of the new ultra-high equipment as well as the associated calibration procedures will be described and detailed.","authors":["Alain Vissiere","Hichem Nouira","Mohamed Damak","Olivier Gibaru"],"meta":["September 2012Measurement Science and Technology 23(9)","DOI:10.1088/0957-0233/23/9/094014"],"references":["280216730_Evaluation_of_the_capacitive_displacement_measurements_in_mechanical_metrology_with_cylindrical_artefacts","280216729_Experimental_evaluation_of_the_dissociated_metrological_technique_DMT_for_the_geometrical_measurement_in_metrological_applications","259562166_Contribution_a_l'evaluation_des_angles_-_conception_realisation_et_validation_d'un_plateau_pivotant_de_tres_haute_precision_-_vers_une_reference_nationale","254499411_A_newly_conceived_cylinder_measuring_machine_and_methods_that_eliminate_the_spindle_errors","242326784_Application_d'une_nouvelle_conception_d'architecture_a_une_machine_de_mesure_de_resolution_nanometrique_Application_of_a_new_architecture_design_to_a_measuring_machine_with_a_nanometric_resolution","290796667_Messapparate_fur_physiker","266180126_Form_and_Length_Measurements_Using_a_Modified_Commercial_Form_Measuring_Instrument","256969684_Investigation_of_the_influence_of_the_main_error_sources_on_the_capacitive_displacement_measurements_with_cylindrical_artefacts","245226365_Elimination_of_Geometrical_Errors_by_Permutations_-_Application_to_a_Rotary_Table","238798802_Limitations_of_precision_length_measurements_based_on_interferometers"]}
