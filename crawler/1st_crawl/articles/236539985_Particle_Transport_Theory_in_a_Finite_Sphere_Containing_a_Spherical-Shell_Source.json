{"id":"236539985_Particle_Transport_Theory_in_a_Finite_Sphere_Containing_a_Spherical-Shell_Source","abstract":"The method of elementary solutions is used to compute the radiation field due to a spherical-shell source located in a finite sphere. In addition, exact analysis and the F /SUB N/ method are used to establish an approximate solution that can be evaluated with modest computational effort to yield results accurate to five significant figures.","authors":["C.
