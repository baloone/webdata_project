{"id":"316605372_The_Effect_of_Room_Characteristics_upon_Vocal_Intensity_and_Rate","abstract":"Groups of 23 males read 12 test phrases in each of eight rooms. The rooms represented two sizes, shapes, and reverberation times. Microphones led to two meters that registered vocal intensity and, in one instance, duration of the phrases. Each set of measurements was treated by analysis of variance. Both rate and intensity of reading were affected by the size and reverberation time of the room and not by the shape. Rate was significantly slower in the larger and the less reverberant rooms. Apparently vocal intensity was greater in the smaller and less reverberant rooms; and readers consistently increased their intensity as they read the 12 phrases in the less reverberant rooms. Differences in this regard, occasioned by the sound treatment of the rooms, were highly significant.","authors":["J.W. Black"],"meta":["March 1950","DOI:10.1121/1.1906585"],"references":[]}
