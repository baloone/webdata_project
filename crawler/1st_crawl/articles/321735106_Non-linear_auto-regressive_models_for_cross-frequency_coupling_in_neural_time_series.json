Of particular relevance, slow fluctuations of brain activity have been shown to affect high frequency neural activity, by regulating the excitability level of neural populations. Such cross-frequency-coupling can take several forms. In the most frequently observed type, the power of high frequency activity is time-locked to a specific phase of slow frequency oscillations, yielding phase-amplitude-coupling (PAC). Even when readily observed in neural recordings, such non-linear coupling is particularly challenging to formally characterize. Typically, neuroscientists use band-pass filtering and Hilbert transforms with ad-hoc correlations. Here, we explicitly address current limitations and propose an alternative probabilistic signal modeling approach, for which statistical inference is fast and well-posed. To statistically model PAC, we propose to use non-linear auto-regressive models which estimate the spectral modulation of a signal conditionally to a driving signal. This conditional spectral analysis enables easy model selection and clear hypothesis-testing by using the likelihood of a given model. We demonstrate the advantage of the model-based approach on three datasets acquired in rats and in humans. We further provide novel neuroscientific insights on previously reported PAC phenomena, capturing two mechanisms in PAC: influence of amplitude and directionality estimation.","authors":["Tom Dupré la Tour","Lucille Tallot","Laetitia Grabot","Valérie Doyère"],"meta":["December 2017PLoS Computational Biology 13(12):e1005893","DOI:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005893","Project: Non-linear auto-regressive models for cross-frequency coupling in neural time series"],"references":["345851261_Nonsinusoidal_oscillations_underlie_pathological_phase-amplitude_coupling_in_the_motor_cortex_in_Parkinson's_disease","325126562_Corticothalamic_phase_synchrony_and_cross-frequency_coupling_predict_human_memory_formation","316468192_Sequence_learning_modulates_neural_responses_and_oscillatory_coupling_in_human_and_monkey_auditory_cortex","316011777_A_neural_mass_model_of_cross_frequency_coupling","314648291_Communication_between_Brain_Areas_Based_on_Nested_Oscillations","312248019_Discriminating_Valid_from_Spurious_Indices_of_Phase-Amplitude_Coupling","312189273_Updating_temporal_expectancy_of_an_aversive_event_engages_striatal_plasticity_under_amygdala_control","329478866_Threshold_Autoregression_Limit_Cycles_and_Cyclical_Data","323166332_Multivariate_cross-frequency_coupling_via_generalized_eigendecomposition","317725287_Parametric_estimation_of_spectrum_driven_by_an_exogenous_signal","311637361_Non-Sinusoidal_Activity_Can_Produce_Cross-Frequency_Coupling_in_Cortical_Signals_in_the_Absence_of_Functional_Interaction_between_Neural_Sources","312165703_Brain_Oscillations_and_the_Importance_of_Waveform_Shape","312144727_Dual_origins_of_measured_phase-amplitude_coupling_reveal_distinct_neural_mechanisms_underlying_human_episodic_memory_in_the_human_cortex","307441088_Episodic_sequence_memory_is_supported_by_a_theta-gamma_phase_code","306362710_Neuronal_Oscillations_with_Non-sinusoidal_Morphology_Produce_Spurious_Phase-to-Amplitude_Coupling_and_Directionality"]}
