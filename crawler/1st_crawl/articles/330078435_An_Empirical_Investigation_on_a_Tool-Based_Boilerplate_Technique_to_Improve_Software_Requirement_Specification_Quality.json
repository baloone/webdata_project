{"id":"330078435_An_Empirical_Investigation_on_a_Tool-Based_Boilerplate_Technique_to_Improve_Software_Requirement_Specification_Quality","abstract":"The process of producing software requirements specification (SRS) is known to be challenging due to the amount of effort, skills and experience needed in writing good quality SRS. A tool-based boilerplate technique is introduced to provide assistance in identifying essential requirements for a generic information management system and translating them into standard requirements statements in the SRS. This paper presents an empirical investigation to evaluate the usability of the prototype. Results showed that the tool-based boilerplate technique has high usability, usefulness and ease of use.
