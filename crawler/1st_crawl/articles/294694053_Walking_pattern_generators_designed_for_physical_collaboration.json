{"id":"294694053_Walking_pattern_generators_designed_for_physical_collaboration","abstract":"This paper is about the design of humanoid walking pattern generators to be used for physical collaboration. A particular use case is a humanoid robot helping a human to carry large and/or heavy objects. To do this, we construct a reduced model which takes into account physical interaction. This is used in a model predictive control framework to generate separate behaviors for being a follower or a leader. The approach is then validated both on simulation and on the HRP-4 humanoid robot. Index Termsâ€” Humanoid walking, human-humanoid physical interaction, model-predictive control.","authors":["Don Joven Agravante","Alexander Sherikov","Pierre-Brice Wieber","Andrea Cherubini"],"meta":["May 2016","DOI:10.1109/ICRA.2016.7487296","Conference: ICRA 2016"],"references":["332683654_Human-Humanoid_Collaborative_Carrying","281886117_Collaborative_Human-Humanoid_Carrying_Using_Vision_and_Haptic_Sensing","261354020_Unified_preview_control_for_humanoid_postural_stability_and_upper-limb_interaction_adaptation","261351057_Proactive_Behavior_of_a_Humanoid_Robot_in_a_Haptic_Transportation_Task_with_a_Human_Partner","308835192_A_robust_linear_MPC_approach_to_online_generation_of_3D_biped_walking_motion","305719467_Modeling_and_Control_of_Legged_Robots","283865630_Whole_body_motion_controller_with_long-term_balance_constraints","283768584_Whole-body_pushing_manipulation_with_contact_posture_planning_of_large_and_heavy_object_for_humanoid_robot","261353981_Humanoid_full-body_controller_adapting_constraints_in_structured_objects_through_updating_task-level_reference_force","261353695_Human-Humanoid_Haptic_Joint_Object_Transportation_Case_Study"]}
