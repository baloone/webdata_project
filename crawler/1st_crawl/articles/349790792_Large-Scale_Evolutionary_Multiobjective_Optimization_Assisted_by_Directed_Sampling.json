{"id":"349790792_Large-Scale_Evolutionary_Multiobjective_Optimization_Assisted_by_Directed_Sampling","abstract":"It is particularly challenging for evolutionary algorithms to quickly converge to the Pareto front in large-scale multi-objective optimization. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a large-scale multi-objective evolutionary algorithm assisted by some selected individuals generated by directed sampling. At each generation, a set of individuals closer to the ideal point are chosen for performing a directed sampling in the decision space, and those non-dominated ones of the sampled solutions are used to assist the reproduction to improve the convergence in evolutionary large-scale multi-objective optimization. In addition, elitist non-dominated sorting is adopted complementarily for environmental selection with a reference vector based method in order to maintain diversity of the population. Our experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is highly competitive on large-scale multi-objective optimization test problems with up to 5000 decision variables compared to five state-of-the-art multi-objective evolutionary algorithms.","authors":["Shufen Qin","Chaoli Sun","Yaochu Jin","Ying Tan"],"meta":["March 2021IEEE transactions on neural networks / a publication of the IEEE Neural Networks Council PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TEVC.2021.3063606"],"references":["342852786_Adaptive_Offspring_Generation_for_Evolutionary_Large-Scale_Multiobjective_Optimization","341661283_Multiple-strategy_learning_particle_swarm_optimization_for_large-scale_optimization_problems","339919254_A_modified_particle_swarm_optimization_based_on_decomposition_with_different_ideal_points_for_many-objective_optimization_problems","339782398_Solving_Large-Scale_Multi-Objective_Optimization_Problems_with_Sparse_Optimal_Solutions_via_Unsupervised_Neural_Networks","338673915_Evolutionary_Large-Scale_Multiobjective_Optimization_for_Ratio_Error_Estimation_of_Voltage_Transformers","333186147_An_Evolutionary_Algorithm_for_Large-Scale_Sparse_Multi-Objective_Optimization_Problems","331846072_Efficient_Large-Scale_Multiobjective_Optimization_Based_on_a_Competitive_Swarm_Optimizer","330692272_Accelerating_Large-Scale_Multiobjective_Optimization_via_Problem_Reformulation","339505626_Enhancing_MOEAD_with_Information_Feedback_Models_for_Large-Scale_Many-Objective_Optimization","332645368_A_Similarity-Based_Cooperative_Co-Evolutionary_Algorithm_for_Dynamic_Interval_Multiobjective_Optimization_Problems"]}
