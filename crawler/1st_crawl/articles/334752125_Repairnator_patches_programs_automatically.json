{"id":"334752125_Repairnator_patches_programs_automatically","abstract":"Repairnator is a bot. It constantly monitors software bugs discovered during continuous integration of open-source software and tries to fix them automatically. If it succeeds in synthesizing a valid patch, Repairnator proposes the patch to the human developers, disguised under a fake human identity. To date, Repairnator has been able to produce patches that were accepted by the human developers and permanently merged into the code base. This is a milestone for human-competitiveness in software engineering research on automatic program repair.","authors":["Martin Monperrus","Simon Urli","Thomas Durieux","Matias Martinez"],"meta":["July 2019","DOI:10.1145/3349589"],"references":["325728100_How_to_design_a_program_repair_bot_insights_from_the_repairnator_project","315638705_Dynamic_Patch_Generation_for_Null_Pointer_Exceptions_using_Metaprogramming","309450255_Automatic_Repair_of_Real_Bugs_in_Java_A_Large-Scale_Experiment_on_the_Defects4J_Dataset","305026872_ASTOR_a_program_repair_library_for_Java_demo","297777476_Nopol_Automatic_Repair_of_Conditional_Statement_Bugs_in_Java_Programs","335641070_Explainable_Software_Bot_Contributions_Case_Study_of_Automated_Bug_Fixes","335361552_SapFix_Automated_End-to-End_Repair_at_Scale","322060744_Software_Bots","302073954_Among_the_Machines_Human-Bot_Interaction_on_Social_QA_Websites","299868538_Is_the_cure_worse_than_the_disease_overfitting_in_automated_program_repair"]}
