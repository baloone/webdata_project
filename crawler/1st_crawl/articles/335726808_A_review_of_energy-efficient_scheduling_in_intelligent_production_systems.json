{"id":"335726808_A_review_of_energy-efficient_scheduling_in_intelligent_production_systems","abstract":"Recently, many manufacturing enterprises pay closer attention to energy efficiency due to increasing energy cost and environmental awareness. Energy-efficient scheduling of production systems is an effective way to improve energy efficiency and to reduce energy cost. During the past 10 years, a large amount of literature has been published about energy-efficient scheduling, in which more than 50% employed swarm intelligence and evolutionary algorithms to solve the complex scheduling problems. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive literature review of production scheduling for intelligent manufacturing systems with the energy-related constraints and objectives. The main goals are to summarize, analyze, discuss, and synthesize the existing achievements, current research status, and ongoing studies, and to give useful insight into future research, especially intelligent strategies for solving the energy-efficient scheduling problems. The scope of this review is focused on the journal publications of the Web of Science database. The energy efficiency-related publications are classified and analyzed according to five criteria. Then, the research trends of energy efficiency are discussed. Finally, some directions are pointed out for future studies.","authors":["Kai Zhou Gao","Yun Huang","Ali Sadollah","Ling Wang"],"meta":["September 2019Complex & Intelligent Systems 6(23)","DOI:10.1007/s40747-019-00122-6","Project: Rescheduling"],"references":["332100884_New_model_of_planning_and_scheduling_for_job-shop_production_system_with_energy_consideration","331723433_Energy-Oriented_Scheduling_for_Hybrid_Flow_Shop_With_Limited_Buffers_Through_Efficient_Multi-Objective_Optimization","330379571_Genetic_Optimization_of_Energy-_and_Failure-Aware_Continuous_Production_Scheduling_in_Pasta_Manufacturing","330032058_An_Improved_Scheduling_Approach_for_Minimizing_Total_Energy_Consumption_and_Makespan_in_a_Flexible_Job_Shop_Environment","329749201_Multi-Objective_Bi-Level_Programming_for_the_Energy-Aware_Integration_of_Flexible_Job_Shop_Scheduling_and_Multi-Row_Layout","334772666_Energy-efficient_scheduling_for_multi-objective_two-stage_flow_shop_using_a_hybrid_ant_colony_optimisation_algorithm","332344652_Multi-objective_optimization_for_energy-efficient_flexible_job_shop_scheduling_problem_with_transportation_constraints","332298858_Stochastic_multi-objective_modelling_and_optimization_of_an_energy-conscious_distributed_permutation_flow_shop_scheduling_problem_with_the_total_tardiness_constraint","331836509_A_multi-objective_iterated_local_search_algorithm_for_comprehensive_energy-aware_hybrid_flow_shop_scheduling","331266118_Energy-efficient_scheduling_for_sustainable_manufacturing_systems_with_renewable_energy_resources"]}
