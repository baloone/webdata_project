{"id":"343536273_Building_Community-Based_Approaches_to_Systemic_Reform_in_Mathematical_Biology_Education","abstract":"Starting in the early 2000â€™s, several reports were released recognizing the convergence of mathematics, biology and computer science, and calling for a rethinking of how undergraduates are prepared for careers in research and the science and technology workforce. This call for change requires careful consideration of the mathematical biology education system to identify key components and leverage points for change. This paper demonstrates the wide range of resources and approaches available to the mathematical biology education community to create systemic change by highlighting the efforts of four community-based education reform organizations. A closer look at these organizations provides an opportunity to examine how to leverage components of the education system including faculty, academic institutions, students, access to resources, and the power of community.","authors":["Olcay Akman","Carrie Diaz Eaton","Dan Hrozencik","Kristin Jenkins"],"meta":["August 2020Bulletin of Mathematical Biology 82(8)","DOI:10.1007/s11538-020-00781-4","Project: Interdisciplinary Mathematics Education"],"references":["339482154_Scientific_Meetings_for_All","339418991_Modelling_and_Simulation_Helping_Students_Acquire_This_Skill_Using_a_Stock_and_Flow_Approach_with_MathBench","337863694_Talking_about_Leaving_Revisited_Persistence_Relocation_and_Loss_in_Undergraduate_STEM_Education_Persistence_Relocation_and_Loss_in_Undergraduate_STEM_Education","335499271_I_Was_Told_There_Would_Be_No_Math_Involved","331179824_How_People_Learn_II_Learners_Contexts_and_Cultures","317953689_Mathematical_mindsets_unleashing_students'_potential_through_creative_math_inspiring_messages_and_innovative_teaching","313403758_Faculty_development_and_student_learning_Assessing_the_connections","309066163_Reaching_students_What_research_says_about_effective_instruction_in_undergraduate_science_and_engineering","301771853_The_Mathematical_Sciences_in_2025","297658595_STEM_Reform_Outcomes_Through_Communities_of_Transformation"]}
