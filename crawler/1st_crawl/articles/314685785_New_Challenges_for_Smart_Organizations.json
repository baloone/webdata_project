{"id":"314685785_New_Challenges_for_Smart_Organizations","abstract":"The chapter introduces the different types of wireless technologies that can be applied in smart organizations. Smart organization (SO) is an outstanding representative of networked organizations, as its organization structure, communication, and knowledge-based applications are coordinated and all networked. The chapter describes the communication demands of SO, taking care on wired and especially wireless networks that offer mobility for users. Access at anytime from anywhere to enterprise information for registered users guarantees mobility that is a basic demand for a dynamic organization today. Security, trust, and interoperability aspects are also discussed as important characteristics ofthe up-to-date infocom systems. Finally, the main impacts of wireless technologies on smart organizations are summarized. Through the survey of the structure and operation of wireless technologies and their impacts, it is easy to understand that wireless communication technology has a strategic role in the effective, competitive operation of networked organizations.","authors":["Istvan Mezgar"],"meta":["January 2007","DOI:10.4018/9781591403906.ch007","In book: Integration of ICT in Smart Organizations"],"references":["232625380_The_Role_of_Trust_and_Deception_in_Virtual_Societies","221515563_Trust_without_touch_jumpstarting_long-distance_trust_with_initial_social_activities","221514454_Effects_of_four_computer-mediated_communications_channels_on_trust_development","221511452_Will_the_Organisation_Disappear_The_Challenges_of_the_New_Economy_and_Future_Perspectives","220437995_Communication_and_Trust_in_Global_Virtual_Teams","50313187_Not_So_Different_After_All_A_Cross-discipline_View_of_Trust","23738806_The_PIF_Process_Interchange_Format_and_Framework","329322984_Handbook_of_Applied_Cryptography","319394683_Computer_networks","319393990_Knowledge_Interchange_Format_Version_30_Reference_Manual","301870492_The_Anatomy_of_the_Grid_-_Enabling_Scalable_Virtual_Organizations","298128739_Standards-Based_Wireless_Networking_Alternatives","243785927_The_Satellite_Communication_Applications_Handbook","242698444_Internet_Computing_and_the_Emerging_Grid","239566456_Applied_Cryptography_Selected_Resources_for_IY5603_Symmetric_Cryptography_General_Interest_The_most_important_single_reference_is_the_following_book_It_is_the_best_single_book_on_cryptography_and_it_i","238198454_Bluetooth_End_to_End","235967697_Mobile_Satellite_Communication_Networks","234806728_The_Wireless_Networking_Starter_Kit","234775191_Security_Engineering_A_Guide_to_Building_Dependable_Distributed_Systems","215915900_Trust_and_the_Virtual_Organization","44825100_Trust_The_Social_Virtues_and_the_Creation_of_Prosperity","2999824_The_emerging_knowledge-based_economy"]}
