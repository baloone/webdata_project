{"id":"334110064_Teaching_programming_using_dedicated_Arduino_Educational_Board","abstract":"This paper presents a new approach to teaching programming to undergraduate computer science students. A dedicated Arduino board along with custom application programming interface (API) was introduced into programming classes with a view to strengthen students’ engagement and improving the attractiveness of the course. The students were presented with basic functionalities of the board, which gave them a possibility to accomplish their own projects—typically video games—without any background in electronics. The level of engagement of the participants was observed by the tutors during classes and also reviewed based on questionnaires filled by 347 first‐, second‐, and third‐year undergraduates. The results indicated that the proposed approach was well received by nearly 80%, while nearly 75% of the participants expressed a wish to continue their Computer Science education using Arduino.","authors":["Izabela Perenc","Tomasz Jaworski","Piotr Duch"],"meta":["June 2019Computer Applications in Engineering Education 27(1-2)","DOI:10.1002/cae.22134"],"references":["327405458_An_Enriched_Introduction_to_Programming_Course_with_Scratch","327405399_An_Enriched_Introduction_to_Programming_Course_with_Scratch","327006434_Enriching_Computer_Science_Programming_Classes_with_Arduino_Game_Development","325353110_Internet_of_Things_education_Labor_market_training_needs_and_national_policies","320372920_Gamification_in_Computer_Programming_Effects_on_learning_engagement_self-efficacy_and_intrinsic_motivation","319959446_Internet_of_Things_in_Higher_Education_A_Study_on_Future_Learning","305084679_Learning_Programming_through_Games_and_Contests_Overview_Characterisation_and_Discussion","304627725_The_study_of_gamification_application_architecture_for_programming_language_course","290460188_Gamification_in_online_collaborative_learning_for_programming_courses_A_literature_review","281690868_The_study_of_gamification_application_architecture_for_programming_language_course","279936430_Learning_Basic_Programming_Concepts_By_Creating_Games_With_Scratch_Programming_Environment","274632820_USING_SCRATCH_IN_INTRODUCTION_TO_PROGRAMMING_COURSE_FOR_ENGINEERING_STUDENTS","273496789_Learning_object-oriented_paradigm_by_playing_computer_games_Concepts_first_approach","272408977_Assessing_the_Usefulness_of_Object-based_Programming_Education_Using_Arduino","267799348_Mother's_Day_Warrior_Cats_and_Digital_Fluency_Stories_from_the_Scratch_Online_Community","265789392_Gamification_for_Engaging_Computer_Science_Students_in_Learning_Activities_A_Case_Study","261022239_Using_a_Serious_Game_Approach_to_Teach_'Operator_Precedence'_to_Introductory_Programming_Students","259821680_Improving_Participation_and_Learning_with_Gamification","257872513_A_Visual_Robot-Programming_Environment_for_Multidisciplinary_Education","224579950_MATLAB_meets_LEGO_Mindstorms_-_A_freshman_introduction_course_into_practical_engineering","221514864_Storytelling_Alice_motivates_middle_school_girls_to_learn_computer_programming","220707008_Implementing_IT0CS0_with_scratch_app_inventor_for_android_and_lego_mindstorms","38105230_Mobile_Game_Development_for_Multiple_Devices_in_Education","2723191_Teaching_Computer_Science_A_Problem_Solving_Approach_that_Works","329954391_ABC_Application_Based_Collaborative_Approach_to_Improve_Student_Engagement_for_a_Programming_Course","326595118_Designing_Engaging_Learning_Experiences_in_Programming","326054365_Development_of_IoT_applications_in_civil_engineering_classrooms_using_mobile_devices","325897466_Implementing_a_theory-driven_gamification_model_in_higher_education_flipped_courses_Effects_on_out-of-class_activity_completion_and_quality_of_artifacts","323659643_A_Gamified_Approach_to_Automated_Assessment_of_Programming_Assignments","323588425_IoT_rapid_prototyping_laboratory_setup","321598845_Reflections_on_the_Teaching_of_Programming_Methods_and_Implementations","319472748_Correctness_assessment_of_a_crowdcoding_project_in_a_computer_programming_introductory_course","318440571_From_Android_games_to_coding_in_C-An_approach_to_motivate_novice_engineering_students_to_learn_programming_A_case_study","317663813_Development_and_Application_of_the_ChArduino_Toolkit_for_Teaching_how_to_Program_Arduino_Boards_through_the_CC_Interpreter_Ch","316902831_Initiating_a_pipeline_for_the_computer_industry_Using_scratch_and_LEGO_robotics","316134051_Design_and_Implementation_of_an_IDE_for_Learning_Programming_Languages_Using_a_Gamification_Service","302147235_An_Effective_Approach_to_Build_Smart_Building_Based_on_Internet_of_Things_IoT","286457865_Online_game-based_programming_learning_for_high_school_students_-_A_case_study","276486438_Andruino-A1_Low-Cost_Educational_Mobile_Robot_Based_on_Android_and_Arduino"]}
