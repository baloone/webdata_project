{"id":"331832481_SURFACE_WATER_pH_A_PROXY_TO_ACIDIFICATION_OF_ESTUARINE_WATER_OF_INDIAN_SUNDARBANS","abstract":"The estuarine waters of mangrove dominated Indian Sundarbans receive a considerable load of carbon through outwelling of litter and detritus throughout the year from the adjacent intertidal mudflats. Twenty four stations were selected in this World Heritage Site in the lower Gangetic delta region to evaluate the interrelationships between dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and pH of the aquatic phase with the aim to understand the pulse of acidification in the estuaries of this deltaic complex. The data used in the present study was collected during 2018 from our field works during post monsoon.","authors":["Abhijit Mitra"],"meta":["March 2019International Journal of Environmental Analytical Chemistry","Project: SUNDARBAN FIELD DIARY"],"references":["320933544_Seasonal_variability_of_the_inorganic_carbon_system_in_a_large_coastal_plain_estuary","264737098_Basics_of_Marine_and_Estuarine_Ecology","264424195_Blue_Carbon_Reservoir_of_the_Blue_Planet","262009924_Sensitivity_of_Mangrove_Ecosystem_to_Changing_Climate_Sensitivity_of_Mangrove_Ecosystem_to_Changing_Climate_Sensitivity_of_Mangrove_Ecosystem_to_Changing_Climate","257130339_A_system_dynamic_modeling_of_carbon_cycle_from_mangrove_litter_to_the_adjacent_Hooghly_estuary_India","255639343_Observed_changes_in_water_mass_properties_in_the_Indian_Sundarbans_northwestern_Bay_of_Bengal_during_1980-2007","305178427_Inter-annual_variation_of_salinity_in_Indian_Sundarbans","256714998_Chemical_erosion_in_the_eastern_Himalaya_Major_ion_composition_of_the_Brahmaputra_and_13C_of_dissolved_inorganic_carbon","256681539_Carbon_fluxes_pCO2_and_substrate_weathering_in_a_large_northern_river_basin_Canada_Carbon_isotope_perspectives","251586332_Standing_Biomass_and_Carbon_Storage_of_Above-Ground_Structures_in_Dominant_Mangrove_Trees_in_the_Sundarbans","250215462_Carbon_outwelling_from_a_mangrove_forest_with_adjacent_seagrass_beds_and_coral_reefs_Gazi_Bay_Kenya","245611409_Carbon_sinks_in_mangrove_forests_and_their_implications_to_the_carbon_budget_of_tropical_coastal_eco","240491391_Spatial_and_seasonal_dynamics_of_total_suspended_sediment_and_organic_carbon_species_in_the_Congo_River","233717172_Influence_of_Mangrove_Detritus_in_an_Estuarine_Ecosystem","233920126_Controls_on_the_Variability_of_Organic_Matter_and_Dissolved_Inorganic_Carbon_Ages_in_Northeast_US_Rivers"]}
