{"id":"327793869_Vehicle_Routing_Problem_with_Roaming_Delivery_Locations_and_Stochastic_Travel_Times_VRPRDL-S","abstract":"This paper presents an approach to model and solve the vehicle routing problem with random delivery locations and stochastic travel times (VRPRDL-S), a variant of the vehicle routing problem with random delivery locations that allows, for instance, the possibility of having a parcel delivered to the trunk of the customer’s vehicle, which can be in different locations during the same day. In the proposed model, the classical distance matrix is replaced by a matrix of probability distributions composed of the distribution of travel times between two points. Thus, the model integrates the fact that the travel time between two points is nondeterministic. This paper explores in detail a medium-sized problem and uses a combination of a Monte-Carlo method and an enhanced greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP) to find a pseudo-optimum. Moreover, the relevance of the approach is validated through a campaign test. This work intends to build on the current state of the art by proposing a new variant of the VRP and a heuristic method to solve it.","authors":["Augustin Lombard","Simon Tamayo Giraldo","Frédéric Fontane"],"meta":["January 2018Transportation Research Procedia 30:167-177","DOI:10.1016/j.trpro.2018.09.019","Project: City Logistics Research Chair (Chaire Logistique Urbaine)"],"references":["326052534_Simulation_Applied_to_Urban_Logistics_A_State_of_the_Art_Towards_Sustainable_and_Liveable_Cities","259079292_Selective_vehicle_routing_problems_under_uncertainty_without_recourse","236737208_A_Stochastic_Vehicle_Routing_Problem_with_Travel_Time_Uncertainty_Trade-Off_Between_Cost_and_Customer_Service","228255796_An_Incremental_Tabu_Search_Heuristic_for_the_Generalized_Vehicle_Routing_Problem_with_Time_Windows","317722225_SIMULATION_APPLIED_TO_URBAN_LOGISTICS_A_STATE_OF_THE_ART","316747641_Vehicle_routing_with_roaming_delivery_locations","313786615_A_branch-and-price_algorithm_for_the_vehicle_routing_problem_with_roaming_delivery_locations","309888469_Incorporating_Travel_Time_Uncertainty_into_the_Design_of_Service_Regions_for_DeliveryPickup_Problems_with_Time_Windows","259624370_Models_and_Algorithms_for_Stochastic_and_Robust_Vehicle_Routing_with_Deadlines","254908586_Vehicle_Routing_under_Uncertainty"]}
