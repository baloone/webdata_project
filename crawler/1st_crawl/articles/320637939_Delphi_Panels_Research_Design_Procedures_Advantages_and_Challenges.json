{"id":"320637939_Delphi_Panels_Research_Design_Procedures_Advantages_and_Challenges","abstract":"Among the typical dissertation research designs, one particular design that is slowly gaining acceptance is that of the Delphi Method. Using a panel of experts to achieve consensus in solving a problem, deciding the most appropriate course of action, or establishing causation where none previously existed, particularly in areas of business or education research, are uniquely ideal to employment of the design. This article reviews the origins of the method, provides detail on assembling the panel and executing the process, gives examples of conventional and modified Delphi designs, and summarizes the inherent advantages and disadvantages that the design brings. The article closes with some advice for those contemplating its use in their dissertations.","authors":["Jay R Avella"],"meta":["January 2016International Journal of Doctoral Studies 11:305-321","DOI:10.28945/3561"],"references":[]}
