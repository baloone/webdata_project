{"id":"233864740_Face_Recognition_A_Literature_Review","abstract":"The task of face recognition has been actively\nresearched in recent years. This paper provides an up-to-date review\nof major human face recognition research. We first present an\noverview of face recognition and its applications. Then, a literature\nreview of the most recent face recognition techniques is presented.\nDescription and limitations of face databases which are used to test\nthe performance of these face recognition algorithms are given. A\nbrief summary of the face recognition vendor test (FRVT) 2002, a\nlarge scale evaluation of automatic face recognition technology, and\nits conclusions are also given. Finally, we give a summary of the\nresearch results.","authors":["Ahmad Tolba","Ali El-Baz","Ahmed A El-Harby"],"meta":["January 2005"],"references":["319877813_Face_Recognition_by_Elastic_Bunch_Graph_Matching","277289434_Robust_Face_Recognition_Using_Symmetric_Shape-from-Shading","290109971_A_basic_study_on_human_face_recognition","278651717_The_Nature_of_Statistical_Learning_Theory","263872847_FACE_RECOGNITION_USING_SUPPORT_VECTOR_MACHINES_WITH_LOCAL_CORRELATION_KERNELS","256075302_Eigenfaces_for_Recognition","247166608_Personal_Identification_and_Description","243782020_Distortion_invariant_object_recognition_in_the_dynamik_link_architecture","243776199_Face_recognition_from_one_model_view","243762750_Practical_face_recognition_and_verification_with_WISARD"]}
