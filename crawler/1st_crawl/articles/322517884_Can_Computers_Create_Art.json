{"id":"322517884_Can_Computers_Create_Art","abstract":"This paper discusses whether computers, using Artifical Intelligence (AI), could create art. The first part concerns AI-based tools for assisting with art making. The history of technologies that automated aspects of art is covered, including photography and animation. In each case, we see initial fears and denial of the technology, followed by acceptance, and a blossoming of new creative and professional opportunities for artists. The hype and reality of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools for art making is discussed, together with predictions about how AI tools will be used. The second part concerns AI systems that could conceive of artwork, and be credited with authorship of an artwork.","authors":["Aaron Hertzmann"],"meta":["January 2018Arts 7(2)","DOI:10.3390/arts7020018"],"references":["320123561_Art_in_the_Age_of_Machine_Intelligence","305615978_Man_is_to_Computer_Programmer_as_Woman_is_to_Homemaker_Debiasing_Word_Embeddings","322059577_BAM_The_Behance_Artistic_Media_Dataset_for_Recognition_Beyond_Photography","322058318_StackGAN_Text_to_Photo-Realistic_Image_Synthesis_with_Stacked_Generative_Adversarial_Networks","320879959_The_seven_deadly_sins_of_AI_predictions","319770355_Generative_Adversarial_Nets","319770249_Deep_Visual-Semantic_Alignments_for_Generating_Image_Descriptions","316538983_BAM_The_Behance_Artistic_Media_Dataset_for_Recognition_Beyond_Photography","315632587_Computing_the_arts","311610841_Image_Style_Transfer_Using_Convolutional_Neural_Networks"]}
