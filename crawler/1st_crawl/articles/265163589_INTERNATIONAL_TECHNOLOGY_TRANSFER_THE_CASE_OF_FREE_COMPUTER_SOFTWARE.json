{"id":"265163589_INTERNATIONAL_TECHNOLOGY_TRANSFER_THE_CASE_OF_FREE_COMPUTER_SOFTWARE","abstract":"This study investigates issues of economic development and technology transfer, more specifically, computer software transfer. Linux and other free software technologies offer a great potential from a technological and economical perspective but they still have not been abundantly distributed around the world. This study focuses particularly on human capital as a key factor that influences the familiarity and capability of people within a country toward using computer software. According to the statistical analysis in the study, education and income influence a country's ability to transfer Linux software technology. Software and technology adoption is especially important for less developed countries. It is in the interests of users in the less developed countries to take advantage of Linux in order to catch up sooner with developed countries in terms of computer use, and technical education. Thus it is clear that computer education and training must be supported in these countries. These will in turn stimulate further technology transfer and economic development.","authors":["Emre Erturk"],"meta":["January 2009","DOI:10.13140/2.1.2162.8800","Conference: International Academy of Business and Public Administration DisciplinesAt: Orlando, Florida"],"references":["33051565_Digital_libraries_for_the_developing_world","247892196_The_Global_Competitiveness_Report_2005-2006","245588871_Brazil_falls_in_love_with_Linux","38987200_Economic_Development_in_the_Third_World"]}
