{"id":"261324704_Can_the_packing_efficiency_of_binary_hard_spheres_explain_the_glass-forming_ability_of_bulk_metallic_glasses","abstract":"We perform molecular dynamics simulations to compress binary hard spheres\ninto jammed packings as a function of the compression rate $R$, size ratio\n$\\alpha$, and number fraction $x_S$ of small particles to determine the\nconnection between the glass-forming ability (GFA) and packing efficiency in\nbulk metallic glasses (BMGs). We define the GFA by measuring the critical\ncompression rate $R_c$, below which jammed hard-sphere packings begin to form\n\"random crystal\" structures with defects. We find that for systems with $\\alpha\n\\gtrsim 0.8$ that do not de-mix, $R_c$ decreases strongly with $\\Delta \\phi_J$,\nas $R_c \\sim \\exp(-1/\\Delta \\phi_J^2)$, where $\\Delta \\phi_J$ is the difference\nbetween the average packing fraction of the amorphous packings and random\ncrystal structures at $R_c$. Systems with $\\alpha \\lesssim 0.8$ partially\nde-mix, which promotes crystallization, but we still find a strong correlation\nbetween $R_c$ and $\\Delta \\phi_J$. We show that known metal-metal BMGs occur in\nthe regions of the $\\alpha$ and $x_S$ parameter space with the lowest values of\n$R_c$ for binary hard spheres. Our results emphasize that maximizing GFA in\nbinary systems involves two competing effects: minimizing $\\alpha$ to increase\npacking efficiency, while maximizing $\\alpha$ to prevent de-mixing.","authors":["Kai Zhang","W.
