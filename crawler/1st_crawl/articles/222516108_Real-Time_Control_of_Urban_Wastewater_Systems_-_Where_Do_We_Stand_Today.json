{"id":"222516108_Real-Time_Control_of_Urban_Wastewater_Systems_-_Where_Do_We_Stand_Today","abstract":"This paper presents a review of the current state of the art of real time control (RTC) of urban wastewater systems. Control options not only of the sewer system, but also of the wastewater treatment plant and of receiving water bodies are considered. One section of the paper provides concise definitions of terms frequently used in the literature. Recent developments in the field of RTC include the consideration of the urban wastewater system in its entirety. This allows information from all parts of the wastewater system to be used for control decisions and can lead to a significant improvement of the performance of the wastewater system. Some fundamental concepts of this approach are outlined. Particular emphasis in this paper is laid on methodologies of how to derive a control procedure for a given system. As an example of an RTC system operational in practice, the Qu√©bec Urban Community global predictive RTC system is presented. The paper concludes with an outlook into current and future developments in the area of real time control.The authors are members of the Working Group on Real Time Control of the Joint Committee of the International Association of Hydraulic Research (IAHR) and the International Water Association (IWA).","authors":["Manfred Schuetze","Alberto Campisano","Hubert Colas","Wolfgang Schilling"],"meta":["December 2004Journal of Hydrology 299(3-4):335-348","DOI:10.1016/j.jhydrol.2004.08.010"],"references":["243773576_Real_time_control_of_wastewater_systems","226904707_Improving_Combined_Sewer_Overflow_and_Treatment_Plant_Performance_by_Real-Time_Control_Operation","223301505_Integrated_modelling_for_analysis_and_optimisation_of_wastewater_systems_-_The_Odenthal_case","11953025_Simultaneous_simulation_of_the_integrated_urban_wastewater_system_using_mechanistic_surrogate_models","11953022_Development_of_a_risk_assessment_based_technique_for_designretrofitting_of_WWTPs","11462403_Real_time_control_of_the_integrated_urban_wastewater_system_using_simultaneously_surrogate_models","11460519_Deterministic_Modelling_of_Integrated_Urban_Drainage_Systems","11428630_Status_and_future_trends_of_ICA_in_wastewater_treatment_-_A_European_perspective","11428615_Model_reduction_through_boundary_relocation_to_facilitate_real-time_control_optimisation_in_the_integrated_urban_wastewater_system","2333218_Mathematical_Modelling_Of_Integrated_Urban_Drainage_Systems","290991271_Predictive_control_of_nitrogen_removal_in_WWTP_using_parsimonious_models","289927720_Wastewater_Treatment_Systems_Modelling_Diagnosis_and_Control","289185942_Smart_sewer_systems_improved_performance_by_real_time_control","286997447_Management_and_Institutional_Aspects","286233318_Water_and_wastewater_systems","269267318_Predictive_control_of_nitrogen_removal_in_WWTPS_using_parsimonious_models","269267197_Multi-objective_control_of_urban_wastewater_systems","268595891_From_Pumping_Station_Monitoring_to_Integrated_System_Control_30_Years_of_Practical_Experience_on_RTC_of_Waste_Water_Systems_and_Present_Plans","253544712_Water_Quality_Modeling_A_Review_of_the_Analysis_of_Uncertainty","251439172_Water_Quality_Modeling_A_Review_of_the_Analysis_of_Uncertainty_Paper_6W0756","250141754_The_effects_of_uncertainties_on_the_control_performance_of_sewer_networks","247256231_Probabilistic_Immission_Modelling_of_Receiving_Surface_Waters","243773760_Integrated_simulation_of_the_Dhuenn_river_catchment-supported_by_a_matrix-based_model_notation_for_the_entire_urban_wastewater_system","243773759_Off-line_development_of_RTC_strategies-a_general_approach_and_the_Aachen_case_study","243773575_PASST-die_Planungshilfe_fur_Abflusssteuerung_in_Kanalnetzen","243773574_Optimum_performance_of_a_sewer_and_treatment_system_by_application_of_real_time_control","243773571_Minimizing_acute_river_pollution_from_urban_drainage_systems_by_means_of_integrated_real_time_control","243773570_Operation_and_Performance_of_an_Optimized_Real_Time_Control_System_for_Wet_Weather_Pollution_Control","243773569_RTC_Applications_to_the_Trondheim-Hvringen_wastewater_tunnel","243773568_P_Units_Calibration_for_the_RTC_of_Sewer_Collectors_Using_a_Dimensionless_Approach","243773567_Immission-based_real_time_control_of_the_integrated_urban_wastewater_system","243769834_Dynamical_Modelling_Estimation_in_Wastewater_Treatment_Processes","240311222_Council_Directive_200060EC_Establishing_a_Framework_for_Community_Action_in_The_Field_of_Water_Policy","237123968_PASST_-_A_planning_aid_for_sewer_system_real_time_control","236023330_Model_based_real-time_control_of_sewer_system_using_fuzzy-logic","229417021_Regulators'_setup_with_application_to_the_Roma-Cecchignola_combined_sewer_system","229348706_Optimization_of_Control_Strategies_for_the_Urban_Wastewater_System_-_An_Integrated_Approach","228870519_Real-Time_Control_for_Two_Communities_-_Technical_and_Administrational_Aspects","228720373_Modelling_water_quality_bioindication_and_population_dynamics_in_lotic_ecosystems_using_neural_networks","222698945_Is_combined_sewer_overflow_spill_frequencyvolume_a_good_indicator_of_receiving_water_quality_impact","222600366_On_the_potential_of_genetic_algorithms_in_urban_drainage_modeling","222395403_Integrating_simulation_models_with_a_view_to_optimal_control_of_urban_wastewater_systems","36205768_Simulation_and_control_of_stormwater_impacts_on_river_water_quality","11953026_Ranking_stormwater_control_strategies_under_uncertainty_The_River_Cam_case_study","11953001_Global_predictive_real-time_control_of_Quebec_Urban_Community's_westerly_sewer_network","11462408_Criteria_for_assessment_of_the_operational_potential_of_the_urban_wastewater_system","11428632_Implementation_of_a_wastewater_treatment_plant_operation_support_tool_based_on_on-line_simulation"]}
