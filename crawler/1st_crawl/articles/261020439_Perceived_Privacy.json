{"id":"261020439_Perceived_Privacy","abstract":"To understand the notion of perceived privacy, this paper explores and proposes a model of the relationship between privacy and security. Security is measured in terms of the preparedness required to meet a certain level of threat. Privacy is measured in terms of level of exposure at a certain point of threat. With this understanding, perceived privacy is viewed as a proprietor (the person the information is about) perceiving the broker (handler of information) in his/her place with respect to valuing the sensitivity of the information, and taking care when handling this information. Transparency between proprietor and broker leads to trust.","authors":["Sabah Al-Fedaghi"],"meta":["April 2012","DOI:10.1109/ITNG.2012.90","Conference: Information Technology: New Generations (ITNG), 2012 Ninth International Conference on"],"references":["288303923_Engineering_Privacy_Revisited","276014582_On_Security_Development_Lifecycle_Conceptual_Description_of_Vulnerabilities_Risks_and_Threats","228947649_Users'_perception_of_privacy_in_multimedia_communication","228727029_Homomorphic_Encryption-based_Secure_SIFT_for_Privacy-Preserving_Feature_Extraction","228645079_Perceived_Privacy_in_Ambient_Intelligent_Environments","220204389_Interpretation_of_Information_Processing_Regulations","296694148_Scrutinizing_the_Rule","280300798_Conceptualizing_Privacy","262310922_Proposed_privacy_guidelines_for_the_National_Research_and_Education_Network","247903800_The_Implications_of_Users''Privacy_Perception_on_Communication_and_Information_Privacy_Policies","247835846_Anatomy_of_personal_information_processing_application_to_the_EU_privacy_directive","247166750_Personal_Information_Privacy_and_the_Law","228939772_Consumers'_trust_in_electronic_commerce_transactions_The_role_of_perceived_privacy_and_perceived_security","228809642_An_identity-and_trust-based_computational_model_for_privacy","228226797_Information_Privacy_in_Cyberspace_Transactions","224236209_Extracting_security_requirements_from_reality","224130013_Secure_management_layer_for_JXTA-based_information_sharing_systems","222426719_Bridging_the_gap_between_organizational_and_user_perspectives_of_security_in_the_clinical_domain","220876180_System-based_Approach_to_Software_Vulnerability","220173147_A_critical_contribution_to_theoretical_foundations_of_privacy_studies","220168771_Scrutinizing_the_Rule_Privacy_Realization_in_HIPAA"]}
