{"id":"333663026_Certain_Class_of_Starlike_Functions_Associated_with_Modified_Sigmoid_Function","abstract":"Let SSG∗={f∈A:zf′(z)/f(z)≺2/(1+e-z)}. For this class, several radius estimates and coefficient bounds are obtained as well as structural formula, growth theorem, distortion theorem and inclusion relations are established. Further, let p be an analytic function such that p(0)=1. Sharp bounds on β∈R are determined for various first-order differential subordinations such as 1+βzp′(z)/pk(z), p(z)+βzp′(z)/pk(z)≺2/(1+e-z) to imply that p(z)≺(1+Az)/(1+Bz), where -1≤B<A≤1 or 1+z and also when the position of dominants is interchanged. Moreover, these results are extended by considering β to be a complex number.","authors":["Priyanka Goel","Sivaprasad Kumar"],"meta":["June 2019The Bulletin of the Malaysian Mathematical Society Series 2 43(3):1-35","DOI:10.1007/s40840-019-00784-y"],"references":["321997593_Differential_subordination_and_radius_estimates_for_starlike_functions_associated_with_the_Booth_lemniscate","317756876_Subordinations_for_Functions_with_Positive_Real_Part","274404733_Bound_for_the_fifth_coefficient_of_certain_starlike_functions","267137022_Radius_of_convexity_of_some_subclasses_of_strongly_starlike_functions","265427362_Inverse_coefficients_for_a_b_-convex_functions","320089429_On_uniformly_convex_functions","282431265_Sharp_results_on_linear_combination_of_simple_expressions_of_analytic_functions","267468851_Close-to-convex_functions_with_positive_coefficients","247024470_On_sub-classes_of_uniformly_convex_functions_and_corresponding_class_of_starlike_functions","246156179_Extremal_problems_for_a_family_of_functions_with_positive_real_part_and_for_some_related_families"]}
