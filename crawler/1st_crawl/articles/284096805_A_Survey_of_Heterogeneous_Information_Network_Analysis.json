{"id":"284096805_A_Survey_of_Heterogeneous_Information_Network_Analysis","abstract":"Most real systems consist of a large number of interacting, multi-typed\ncomponents, while most contemporary researches model them as homogeneous\nnetworks, without distinguishing different types of objects and links in the\nnetworks. Recently, more and more researchers begin to consider these\ninterconnected, multi-typed data as heterogeneous information networks, and\ndevelop structural analysis approaches by leveraging the rich semantic meaning\nof structural types of objects and links in the networks. Compared to widely\nstudied homogeneous network, the heterogeneous information network contains\nricher structure and semantic information, which provides plenty of\nopportunities as well as a lot of challenges for data mining. In this paper, we\nprovide a survey of heterogeneous information network analysis. We will\nintroduce basic concepts of heterogeneous information network analysis, examine\nits developments on different data mining tasks, discuss some advanced topics,\nand point out some future research directions.","authors":["Chuan Shi","Yitong Li","Zhang Jiawei","Yizhou Sun"],"meta":["November 2015IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering
