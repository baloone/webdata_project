{"id":"348752280_STAN_spatio-temporal_attention_network_for_pandemic_prediction_using_real-world_evidence","abstract":"Objective\nWe aim to develop a hybrid model for earlier and more accurate predictions for the number of infected cases in pandemics by (1) using patientsâ€™ claims data from different counties and states that capture local disease status and medical resource utilization; (2) utilizing demographic similarity and geographical proximity between locations; and (3) integrating pandemic transmission dynamics into a deep learning model.\n\nMaterials and Methods\nWe proposed a spatio-temporal attention network (STAN) for pandemic prediction. It uses a graph attention network to capture spatio-temporal trends of disease dynamics and to predict the number of cases for a fixed number of days into the future. We also designed a dynamics-based loss term for enhancing long-term predictions. STAN was tested using both real-world patient claims data and COVID-19 statistics over time across US counties.\n\nResults\nSTAN outperforms traditional epidemiological models such as susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR), susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR), and deep learning models on both long-term and short-term predictions, achieving up to 87% reduction in mean squared error compared to the best baseline prediction model.\n\nConclusions\nBy combining information from real-world claims data and disease case counts data, STAN can better predict disease status and medical resource utilization.","authors":["Junyi Gao","Rakshith Sharma","Cheng Qian","Lucas M Glass"],"meta":["January 2021Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association 28(3)","DOI:10.1093/jamia/ocaa322"],"references":["340108285_Initial_Simulation_of_SARS-CoV2_Spread_and_Intervention_Effects_in_the_Continental_US","340099989_Modified_SEIR_and_AI_prediction_of_the_epidemics_trend_of_COVID-19_in_China_under_public_health_interventions","335801157_Short-Term_Traffic_Flow_Prediction_Method_for_Urban_Road_Sections_Based_on_Space-Time_Analysis_and_GRU","328639130_DEFSI_Deep_Learning_Based_Epidemic_Forecasting_with_Synthetic_Information","326280769_A_RNN_based_time_series_approach_for_forecasting_turkish_electricity_load","323520350_Can_Machines_Learn_Respiratory_Virus_Epidemiology_A_Comparative_Study_of_Likelihood-Free_Methods_for_the_Estimation_of_Epidemiological_Dynamics","349825192_Enforcing_Analytic_Constraints_in_Neural_Networks_Emulating_Physical_Systems","339369121_An_interactive_web-based_dashboard_to_track_COVID-19_in_real_time","338200054_Enforcing_statistical_constraints_in_generative_adversarial_networks_for_modeling_chaotic_dynamical_systems","321615695_Intelligent_Data_analysis_and_its_Applications_Volume_II_Proceeding_of_the_First_Euro-China_Conference_on_Intelligent_Data_Analysis_and_Applications_June_13-15_2014_Shenzhen_China"]}
