{"id":"288428545_The_Influence_of_Creative_Style_and_Climate_on_Software_Development_Team_Creativity_An_Exporatory_Study","abstract":"Organizations implement innovative information technology (IT) applications to help them achieve competitive advantage. This exploratory research investigates the role of creative style and climate in work creativity on teams striving to develop innovative IT designs. Creative style was measured with the Kirton Adaption-Innovation Instrument (KAI), and creative climate and work creativity were measured with the Work Environment Inventory (WEI). As hypothesized, the study found 1) a positive relationships between creative style and work creativity, 2) a positive relationship between creative climate stimulants and work creativity, 3) a negative relationship between creative climate obstacles and work creativity, 4) no relationship between creative style and climate, and 5) that creative climate stimulants were significant determinants of work creativity. However, the hypothesis that creative style would predict work creativity was not supported. This research can help those developing innovative IT applications better understand the role creative style and climate play on work teams.","authors":["Mary Helen Fagan"],"meta":["March 2004Journal of Computer Information Systems 44(3):73-80","DOI:10.1080/08874417.2004.11647584"],"references":["242182660_Adaptors_and_Innovators_Different_Perceptions_of_the_Psychological_Climate_for_Creativity","324307258_The_Social_Psychology_of_Organizations","287629983_An_empirical_investigation_into_the_relationship_between_organizational_culture_and_computer_efficacy_as_moderated_by_age_and_gender","286839761_Organizational_factors_for_successful_management_of_software_development","286049419_Complexity_and_control_a_determinants_of_performance_with_information_technology_innovations","281479074_Management's_new_role","280016036_The_impact_of_personality_diversity_on_conflict_in_ISD_teams","274304700_Climate_for_Creativity","271696034_Organizing_for_Innovation","270335112_The_Creativity_Question","260621255_A_cross-national_validation_study_toward_the_development_of_a_selection_battery_for_research_and_development_professional_employees","255624845_Improving_the_Creativity_of_Organizational_Work_Groups","254301176_The_Creative_Environment_Scales_Work_Environment_Inventory","247716757_Adaptors_and_Innovators_in_Organizations","247142197_Managerial_Practices_That_Enhance_Innovation","245814448_Creativity_In_Context_Update_To_The_Social_Psychology_Of_Creativity","242362273_Individuality_in_Learning_Implications_of_Cognitive_Styles_and_Creativity_for_Human_Development","240278589_A_Test_of_the_Validity_of_the_Work_Environment_Inventory","239796524_Innovation_and_Entrepreneurship_Practices_and_Principles","235482512_Predicting_Database_Designer_Potential_with_the_Berger_Aptitude_for_Programming_Test_B-APT","232473674_Adaptors_and_Innovators_A_Description_and_Measure","232101367_A_Dynamic_Theory_of_Personality_Selected_Papers","229742374_Ensuring_Creative_Approaches_in_Information_System_Design","222687133_The_influence_of_software_developers'_creative_style_on_their_attitudes_to_and_assimilation_of_a_software_process_innovation","222023398_Key_human_resource_issues_in_IS_in_the_1990s_Views_of_IS_executives_versus_human_resource_executives","220260408_Information_Technology_Development_Creativity_A_Case_Study_of_Attempted_Radical_Change","220260084_UnStructured_Creativity_in_Information_Systems_Organizations","220259857_Organizational_Mechanisms_for_Enhancing_User_Innovation_in_Information_Technology","220040490_A_Model_Of_Creativity_And_Innovation_In_Organizations","10859583_Finding_Your_Innovation_Sweet_Spot"]}
