{"id":"318551830_Neuroscience-Inspired_Artificial_Intelligence","abstract":"The fields of neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI) have a long and intertwined history. In more recent times, however, communication and collaboration between the two fields has become less commonplace. In this article, we argue that better understanding biological brains could play a vital role in building intelligent machines. We survey historical interactions between the AI and neuroscience fields and emphasize current advances in AI that have been inspired by the study of neural computation in humans and other animals. We conclude by highlighting shared themes that may be key for advancing future research in both fields.","authors":["Demis Hassabis","Dharshan Kumaran","Christopher Summerfield","Matthew Botvinick"],"meta":["July 2017Neuron 95(2):245-258","DOI:10.1016/j.neuron.2017.06.011"],"references":["316507295_R_E_V_I_E_W_S_THE_PARALLEL_DISTRIBUTED_PROCESSING_APPROACH_TO_SEMANTIC_COGNITION","315593322_An_Approximation_of_the_Error_Backpropagation_Algorithm_in_a_Predictive_Coding_Network_with_Local_Hebbian_Synaptic_Plasticity","312346271_Could_a_Neuroscientist_Understand_a_Microprocessor","311411551_Overcoming_catastrophic_forgetting_in_neural_networks","309819314_Random_synaptic_feedback_weights_support_error_backpropagation_for_deep_learning","308092800_A_dynamic_code_for_economic_object_valuation_in_prefrontal_cortex_neurons","305881429_Toward_an_Integration_of_Deep_Learning_and_Neuroscience","304196437_Fast_Sequences_of_Non-spatial_State_Representations_in_Humans","303357683_Neural_Mechanisms_of_Hierarchical_Planning_in_a_Virtual_Subway_Network","301837424_Convolutional_Networks_for_Fast_Energy-Efficient_Neuromorphic_Computing","299491142_Ten_Years_of_Grid_Cells","292074166_Mastering_the_game_of_Go_with_deep_neural_networks_and_tree_search","277411157_Deep_Learning","274010510_Model-based_choices_involve_prospective_neural_activity","264794100_Optimal_Behavioral_Hierarchy","262779120_Human_cognition_Foundations_of_human_reasoning_in_the_prefrontal_cortex","259918474_Resolving_human_object_recognition_in_space_and_time","258064617_Simulation_as_an_engine_of_physical_scene_understanding","258058305_Goals_and_Habits_in_the_Brain","251234161_Representational_geometry_Integrating_cognition_computation_and_the_brain","322808208_Temporal_Difference_Learning_and_TD-Gammon","318494451_Computing_Machinery_and_Intelligence","313493106_Neuroscience_Needs_Behavior_Correcting_a_Reductionist_Bias","313266098_Hippocampal_contributions_to_control_the_Third_way","312157307_DeepStack_Expert-Level_Artificial_Intelligence_in_No-Limit_Poker","312076078_Neural_Mechanisms_of_Selective_Visual_Attention","309091100_Hybrid_computing_using_a_neural_network_with_dynamic_external_memory","308039399_Reinforcement_Learning_and_Episodic_Memory_in_Humans_and_Animals_An_Integrative_Framework","307445105_The_Human_Connectome_Project's_neuroimaging_approach","304405348_On_computable_numbers_with_an_application_to_the_Entscheidungsproblem","304031376_Organizing_Conceptual_Knowledge_in_Humans_with_a_Grid-like_Code","303982652_What_Learning_Systems_do_Intelligent_Agents_Need_Complementary_Learning_Systems_Theory_Updated","303822043_View-Tolerant_Face_Recognition_and_Hebbian_Learning_Imply_Mirror-Symmetric_Neural_Tuning_to_Head_Orientation","299037708_When_and_where_do_we_apply_what_we_learn_A_taxonomy_for_far_transfer","298081771_Entscheidungsproblem_Proc_London_Maths_Soc_ser","295833538_Using_goal-driven_deep_learning_models_to_understand_sensory_cortex","295687298_Explicit_information_for_category-orthogonal_object_properties_increases_along_the_ventral_stream","295245860_Vicarious_trial_and_error","292215395_Neural_networks_and_physical_systems_with_emergent_collective_computational_abilities","287734719_Design_principles_of_the_hippocampal_cognitive_map","286764893_Human-level_concept_learning_through_probabilistic_program_induction","281634826_Labelling_and_optical_erasure_of_synaptic_memory_traces_in_the_motor_cortex","281307335_Learning_to_learn_in_the_development_of_action","279727567_Biochemical_Computation_for_Spine_Structural_Plasticity","274317059_Branch-specific_dendritic_Ca2_spikes_cause_persistent_synaptic_plasticity","273364770_Artificial_Intelligence_The_Very_Idea","272837232_Human-level_control_through_deep_reinforcement_learning","262222321_Distributed_Representations","258251007_Engineering_Approaches_to_Illuminating_Brain_Structure_and_Dynamics","247489163_Sensory_mechanisms_the_reduction_of_redundancy_and_intelligence","247482780_Self-organizing_processes_in_learning_to_learn_words_Development_is_not_induction","243743707_Learning_Internal_Representations_by_Error_Propagation","243716653_A_hierarchical_model_for_visual_object_recognition","242554268_The_Organization_of_Behavior","236252373_Attention_During_Natural_Vision_Warps_Semantic_Representation_Across_the_Human_Brain"]}
