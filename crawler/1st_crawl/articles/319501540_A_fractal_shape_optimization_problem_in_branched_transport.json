{"id":"319501540_A_fractal_shape_optimization_problem_in_branched_transport","abstract":"We investigate the following question: what is the set of unit volume which can be best irrigated starting from a single source at the origin, in the sense of branched transport? We may formulate this question as a shape optimization problem and prove existence of solutions, which can be considered as a sort of \"unit ball\" for branched transport. We establish some elementary properties of optimizers and describe these optimal sets A as sublevel sets of a so-called landscape function which is now classical in branched transport. We prove $\\beta$-H{\\\"o}lder regularity of the landscape function, allowing us to get an upper bound on the Minkowski dimension of the boundary: dim $\\partial$A $\\le$ d -- $\\beta$ (where $\\beta$ := d($\\alpha$ -- (1 -- 1/d)) $\\in$ (0, 1) is a relevant exponent in branched transport, associated with the exponent $\\alpha$ > 1 -- 1/d appearing in the cost). We are not able to prove the upper bound, but we conjecture that $\\partial$A is of non-integer dimension d -- $\\beta$. Finally, we make an attempt to compute numerically an optimal shape, using an adaptation of the phase-field approximation of branched transport introduced some years ago by Oudet and the second author.","authors":["Paul Pegon","Filippo Santambrogio","Qinglan Xia"],"meta":["September 2017","DOI:10.1016/j.matpur.2018.06.007"],"references":["307603970_A_simple_phase-field_approximation_of_the_Steiner_problem_in_dimension_two","273471210_Uniform_estimates_for_a_Modica-Mortola_type_approximation_of_branched_transportation","265767150_Congestion-driven_dendritic_growth","260756092_Approximation_of_Length_Minimization_Problems_Among_Compact_Connected_Sets","243119360_A_variational_model_of_irrigation_patterns","318646821_11_On_the_Lagrangian_branched_transport_model_and_the_equivalence_with_its_Eulerian_formulation_In_the_Applied_Sciences","309037769_Variational_Approximation_of_Functionals_Defined_on_1-dimensional_Connected_Sets_The_Planar_Case","297123726_Updating_Quasi-Newton_Matrices_with_Limited_Storage","267476611_Optimal_transportation_networks_Models_and_theory","266997789_On_landscape_functions_associated_with_transport_paths","266227394_Proprieta_di_Holderianita_di_Alcune_Classi_di_Funzioni","265449587_Steiner_Minimal_Trees","265442869_Direct_Methods_in_the_Calculus_of_Variations","265434641_Un_esempio_di_G_-_-convergenza","264377003_Minimum_Cost_Communication_Networks","260214997_Fractal_regularity_results_on_optimal_irrigation_patterns","255631867_On_the_Holder_regularity_of_the_landscape_function","248390442_Function_Analysis_Sobolev_Spaces_and_Partial_Differential_Equations","228562083_Optimal_paths_related_to_transport_problems","228382042_Optimal_channel_networks_landscape_function_and_branched_transport","226174686_On_the_Limited_Memory_BFGS_Method_for_Large_Scale_Optimization","225658296_A_Modica-Mortola_Approximation_for_Branched_Transport_and_Applications","225284750_Proximal_Newton-Type_Methods_for_Minimizing_Composite_Functions","224877332_Nocedal_J_Updating_Quasi-Newton_Matrices_with_Limited_Storage_Math_Comp_35_773-782","220124383_A_Fast_Iterative_Shrinkage-Thresholding_Algorithm_for_Linear_Inverse_Problems","50334419_Convex_Analysis_and_Measurable_Multifunctions","45872879_A_Modica-Mortola_approximation_for_branched_transport","44442330_Convex_analysis_and_measurable_multifunctions_Charles_Castaing_and_M_Valadier","43158530_Fractal_River_Basins_Chance_and_Self-Organization","39676489_Traffic_Plans"]}
