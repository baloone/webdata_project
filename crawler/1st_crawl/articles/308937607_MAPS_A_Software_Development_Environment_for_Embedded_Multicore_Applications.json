{"id":"308937607_MAPS_A_Software_Development_Environment_for_Embedded_Multicore_Applications","abstract":"The use of heterogeneous Multi-Processor System-on-Chip (MPSoC) is a widely accepted solution to address the increasing demands on high-performance and energy efficiency for modern embedded devices. To enable the full potential of these platforms, new tools are needed to tackle the programming complexity of MPSoCs, while allowing for high productivity. This chapter discusses the MPSoC Application Programming Studio (MAPS), a framework that provides facilities for expressing parallelism and tool flows for parallelization, mapping/scheduling and code generation for heterogeneous MPSoCs. Two case studies of the use of MAPS in commercial environments are presented. This chapter closes by discussing early\nexperiences of transferring the MAPS technology into Silexica Software Solutions GmbH, a start-up company that provides multicore programming tools.","authors":["Rainer Leupers","Miguel Aguilar","Juan Eusse","Jerónimo Castrillón"],"meta":["September 2017","DOI:10.1007/978-94-017-7267-9_2","In book: Handbook of Hardware/Software Codesign (pp.917-949)Publisher: SpringerEditors: Soonhoi Ha, Jürgen Teich"],"references":["324553306_Analysis_of_Process_Traces_for_Mapping_Dynamic_KPN_Applications_to_MPSoCs","283455241_Analysis_and_optimization_of_dynamic_dataflow_programs","254005656_Communication-aware_mapping_of_KPN_applications_onto_heterogeneous_MPSoCs","221340781_Trace-based_KPN_composability_analysis_for_mapping_simultaneous_applications_to_MPSoC_platforms","221061782_MAPS_An_integrated_framework_for_MPSoC_application_parallelization","220801002_Scheduling_multiple_independent_hard-real-time_jobs_on_a_heterogeneous_multiprocessor","4301418_A_Practical_Approach_to_Exploiting_Coarse-Grained_Pipeline_Parallelism_in_C_Programs","4263630_Mapping_Applications_to_Tiled_Multiprocessor_Embedded_Systems","3045013_A_systematic_approach_to_exploring_embedded_system_architectures_at_multiple_abstraction_levels","2888414_StreamIt_A_Language_for_Streaming_Applications","315616236_A_Practical_Approach_to_Exploiting_Coarse-Grained_Pipeline_Parallelism_in_C_Programs","292449626_Profile-driven_parallelisation_of_sequential_programs","281631131_Programming_Heterogeneous_MPSoCs_Tool_Flows_to_Close_the_Software_Productivity_Ga","278390397_Extraction_of_Kahn_Process_Networks_from_While_Loops_in_Embedded_Software","276461898_Execution_Trace--Driven_Energy-Reliability_Optimization_for_Multimedia_MPSoCs","276172760_Parallelism_Extraction_in_Embedded_Software_for_Android_Devices","269630467_Pre-architectural_Performance_Estimation_for_ASIP_Design_Based_on_Abstract_Processor_Models","268182368_Improving_performance_and_productivity_for_software_development_on_TI_Multicore_DSP_platforms","265433050_LLVM_and_Clang_Next_Generation_Compiler_Technology","262493554_Allen_R_Optimizing_Compilers_for_Modern_Architectures_A_Dependence-based_Approach_Morgan_Kaufmann","260541961_MAPS_Mapping_Concurrent_Dataflow_Applications_to_Heterogeneous_MPSoCs","255738606_Compilers_Principles_Techniques_and_Tools_Second_Edition","224001120_Compilers_principles_and_techniques_and_tools","221329680_The_Semantics_of_Simple_Language_for_Parallel_Programming","221061402_Multiprocessor_Resource_Allocation_for_Throughput-Constrained_Synchronous_Dataflow_Graphs","220566518_Static_Scheduling_Algorithms_for_Allocating_Directed_Task_Graphs_to_Multiprocessors","35287377_Bounded_Scheduling_of_Process_Networks","4295636_Automatic_buffer_sizing_for_rate-constrained_KPN_applications_on_multiprocessor_system-on-chip","2997817_Synchronous_data_flow","2560491_Requirements_on_the_Execution_of_Kahn_Process_Networks"]}
