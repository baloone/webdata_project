{"id":"236667492_Becoming_an_Online_Teacher_Adapting_to_a_Changed_Environment_for_Teaching_and_Learning_in_Higher_Education","abstract":"Advancements in online technologies have facilitated a convergence of distance and campus‐based learning and, thus, offer new opportunities for all students through better access to resources, increased interaction between staff and students and greater flexibility in place and time. However, the transition to online teaching and learning presents new challenges as the roles and expectations of both staff and students evolve. An online teacher must create a coherent learning experience for students with whom they may not meet face‐to‐face and, therefore, must develop new support strategies that maintain motivation and encourage interaction. Adapting student‐centred approaches to the online environment has required the development of new skills and changes to teaching practices. This paper presents an analysis of the changed environment for teachers and learners in a post‐graduate coursework programme based on constructivist principles that has moved from predominately on‐campus delivery to online mode. The authors examine the impact of changes to teaching and learning over the past 5 years of the programme's development and reflect on the implications of these for becoming an online teacher.","authors":["Sue Bennett","L.
