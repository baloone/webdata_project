{"id":"301561383_3D_Skeletons_A_State-of-the-Art_Report","abstract":"Given a shape, a skeleton is a thin centered structure which jointly describes the topology and the geometry of the shape. Skeletons provide an alternative to classical boundary or volumetric representations, which is especially effective for applications where one needs to reason about, and manipulate, the structure of a shape. These skeleton properties make them powerful tools for many types of shape analysis and processing tasks. For a given shape, several skeleton types can be defined, each having its own properties, advantages, and drawbacks. Similarly, a large number of methods exist to compute a given skeleton type, each having its own requirements, advantages, and limitations. While using skeletons for two-dimensional (2D) shapes is a relatively well covered area, developments in the skeletonization of three-dimensional (3D) shapes make these tasks challenging for both researchers and practitioners. This survey presents an overview of 3D shape skeletonization. We start by presenting the definition and properties of various types of 3D skeletons. We propose a taxonomy of 3D skeletons which allows us to further analyze and compare them with respect to their properties. We next overview methods and techniques used to compute all described 3D skeleton types, and discuss their assumptions, advantages, and limitations. Finally, we describe several applications of 3D skeletons, which illustrate their added value for different shape analysis and processing tasks.","authors":["Andrea Tagliasacchi","Thomas Delame","Michela Spagnuolo","Nina Amenta"],"meta":["May 2016Computer Graphics Forum 35(2)","DOI:10.1111/cgf.12865"],"references":["284887483_Part-Based_Segmentation_by_Skeleton_Cut_Space_Analysis","278798250_State_of_the_Art_in_Surface_Reconstruction_from_Point_Clouds","277975970_A_Survey_on_Implicit_Surface_Polygonization","265572860_Feature_Preserving_Smoothing_of_Shapes_Using_Saliency_Skeletons","263412813_Delaunay_Conforming_Iso-surface_Skeleton_Extraction_and_Noise_Removal","260358618_The_Medial_Scaffold_of_3D_Unorganized_Point_Clouds","247436166_Any_open_bounded_subset_of_Rn_has_the_same_homotopy_type_than_its_medial_axis","245030084_Deformable_M-Reps_for_3D_Medical_Image_Segmentation","322943070_Local_Symmetry_of_Plane_Curves","319770544_A_survey_of_content_based_3D_shape_retrieval_methods","319770318_Surface_reconstruction_by_Voronoi_filtering","314830371_Adaptive_implicit_modeling_using_subdivision_curves_and_surfaces_as_skeletons","314824593_Efficient_computation_of_a_simplified_medial_axis","313165725_Distance-field_based_skeletons_for_virtual_navigation","312603730_Stability_and_computation_of_medial_axes-a_state-of-the-art_report","308603899_Constructing_anisotropic_geometric_metrics_using_octrees_and_skeletons","292756211_Transformations_for_extracting_new_descriptions_of_shape_models_for_the_perception_of_speech_and_visual_form","287239817_Shape_segmentation_using_medial_point_clouds_with_applications_to_dental_cast_analysis","284907960_Computing_curve_skeletons_from_medial_surfaces_of_3D_shapes","280969270_Segmentation_of_the_Aortic_Valve_Apparatus_in_3D_Echocardiographic_Images_Deformable_Modeling_of_a_Branching_Medial_Structure","280851471_Polygon_Mesh_Processing","277575854_An_Unified_Multiscale_Framework_for_Planar_Surface_and_Curve_Skeletonization","277478252_Computing_Refined_Skeletal_Features_from_Medial_Point_Clouds","275897584_A_Survey_on_skeletonization_algorithms_and_their_applications","274801291_Image_Analysis_Using_Mathematical_Morphology","273500958_A_Fully_Parallel_3D_Thinning_Algorithm_and_Its_Applications","264907677_The_l_-medial_axis","262295298_L-1-Medial_Skeleton_of_Point_Cloud","261562372_L1-Medial_Skeleton_of_Point_Cloud","260655981_Simplification_and_repair_of_polygonal_modes_using_volumetric_techniques","260114067_Comparison_of_Curve_and_Surface_Skeletonization_Methods_for_Voxel_Shapes","260077232_Advanced_navigation_tools_for_virtual_bronchoscopy","259547798_Robust_Segmentation_of_Multiple_Intersecting_Manifolds_from_Unoriented_Noisy_Point_Clouds","259547783_SCALe-invariant_Integral_Surfaces","259389412_Computational_Geometry_Algorithms_And_Applications","258375926_Shape_Analysis_and_Classification_Theory_and_Practice","257608451_Curve_skeleton_extraction_by_coupled_graph_contraction_and_surface_clustering","256152244_Clark_J_Recursively_generated_b-spline_surfaces_on_arbitrary_topological_meshes_Computer-Aided_Design_106_350-355","247448721_Medial_Representations_Mathematics_Algorithms_and_Applications","247442904_From_A_Medial_Surface_To_A_Mesh","247439038_Mean_Curvature_Skeletons","247438925_Qualitative_Comparison_of_Contraction-Based_Curve_Skeletonization_Methods","245951208_Distance_from_a_manifold_in_Euclidean_space","245740364_Computation_of_the_shock_scaffold_for_unorganized_point_samples","245481062_ArchWare_ADL-A_User_Reference_Manual","243774379_Models_for_the_Perception_of_Speech_and_Visual_Form","242801170_Digital_skeletons_in_Euclidean_and_geodesic_spaces","242397003_Sur_les_Points_Singuliers_d'une_Forme_de_Pfaff_Completement_Integrable_ou_d'une_Fonction_Numerique","242359212_An_Introduction_to_Implicit_Surfaces","240095925_Local_Symmetry_of_Plane_Curves","239290171_Computing_Local_Thickness_of_3D_Structures_with_ImageJ","234810904_Plumber_a_method_for_a_multi-scale_decomposition_of_3D_shapes_into_tubular_primitives_and_bodies","238680867_Extracting_Branching_Object_Geometry_via_Cores","235356782_Skeletal_Representations_and_Applications","234807266_Computing_the_medial_surface_of_a_solid_from_a_domain_Delaunay_triangulation"]}
