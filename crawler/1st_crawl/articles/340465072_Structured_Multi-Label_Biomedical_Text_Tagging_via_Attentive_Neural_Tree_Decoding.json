{"id":"340465072_Structured_Multi-Label_Biomedical_Text_Tagging_via_Attentive_Neural_Tree_Decoding","abstract":"We propose a model for tagging unstructured texts with an arbitrary number of terms drawn from a tree-structured vocabulary (i.e., an ontology). We treat this as a special case of sequence-to-sequence learning in which the decoder begins at the root node of an ontological tree and recursively elects to expand child nodes as a function of the input text, the current node, and the latent decoder state. We demonstrate that this method yields state-of-the-art results on the important task of assigning MeSH terms to biomedical abstracts.","authors":["Gaurav Singh","James Thomas","IJ Marshall","John Shawe-Taylor"],"meta":["October 2018","DOI:10.18653/v1/D18-1308","Conference: 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language ProcessingVolume: 2018"],"references":["301376036_Convolutional_neural_networks_for_biomedical_text_classification","265385879_On_the_Properties_of_Neural_Machine_Translation_Encoder-Decoder_Approaches","265252627_Neural_Machine_Translation_by_Jointly_Learning_to_Align_and_Translate","262877889_Learning_Phrase_Representations_using_RNN_Encoder-Decoder_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation","221404441_Conditional_Probability_Tree_Estimation_Analysis_and_Algorithms","325448981_Explainable_Prediction_of_Medical_Codes_from_Clinical_Text","318741178_DocTag2Vec_An_Embedding_Based_Multi-label_Learning_Approach_for_Document_Tagging","309876851_Aspiring_to_Unintended_Consequences_of_Natural_Language_Processing_A_Review_of_Recent_Developments_in_Clinical_and_Consumer-Generated_Text_Processing","309207525_Simultaneous_Learning_of_Trees_and_Representations_for_Extreme_Classification_with_Application_to_Language_Modeling","221619768_A_Kernel_Method_for_Multi-Labelled_Classification"]}
