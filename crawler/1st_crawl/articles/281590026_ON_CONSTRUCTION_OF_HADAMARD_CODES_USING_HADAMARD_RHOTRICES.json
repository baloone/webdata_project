{"id":"281590026_ON_CONSTRUCTION_OF_HADAMARD_CODES_USING_HADAMARD_RHOTRICES","abstract":"Hadamard matrices have wide applications in image analysis, signal processing, coding theory, cryptology and combinatorial designs. The codes generated from Hadamard matrices are of much importance due to the large distance between them. These codes can correct large number of errors and are essential component of the study in communication channels. Rhotrix is a new paradigm of research study and has wide applications in cryptography and coding theory. In the present paper, we introduce Hadamard codes using Hadamard rhotrices.","authors":["P. L.
