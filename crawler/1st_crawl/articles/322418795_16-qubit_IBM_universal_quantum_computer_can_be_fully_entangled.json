{"id":"322418795_16-qubit_IBM_universal_quantum_computer_can_be_fully_entangled","abstract":"Multipartite entanglement is an important evidence that a quantum device can potentially solve problems intractable for classical computers. In this paper, we report on genuine multipartite entanglement of up to 16 qubits on ibmqx5, a 16-qubit superconducting quantum processor accessible via IBM cloud. Connected graph states involving 8 to 16 qubits are prepared on ibmqx5 using low-depth circuits. We demonstrate that any pair of qubits connected on the graph are entangled, therefore for any cut on the graph two parts are entangled, i.e. the entanglement is genuine. Our results set a new record for the number of genuinely entangled qubits for both superconducting circuits and trapped ions systems.","authors":["Yuanhao Wang","Ying Li","Zhang-qi Yin","Bei Zeng"],"meta":["January 2018npj Quantum Information 4(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41534-018-0095-x","Project: Quantum computing via superconducting qubits"],"references":["322329253_Demonstration_of_Envariance_and_Parity_Learning_on_the_IBM_16_Qubit_Processor","319059979_Simple_procedure_for_phase-space_measurement_and_entanglement_validation","315710430_10-Qubit_Entanglement_and_Parallel_Logic_Operations_with_a_Superconducting_Circuit","283471298_Entropic_uncertainty_and_measurement_reversibility","261837868_Superconducting_quantum_circuits_at_the_surface_code_threshold_for_fault_tolerance","228109550_Multiparty_entanglement_in_graph_states","317108283_Compressed_quantum_computation_using_a_remote_five-qubit_quantum_computer","315904357_Violation_of_noninvasive_macrorealism_by_a_superconducting_qubit_Implementation_of_a_Leggett-Garg_test_that_addresses_the_clumsiness_loophole","303330125_Performing_Quantum_Computing_Experiments_in_the_Cloud","303221923_Experimental_test_of_Mermin_inequalities_on_a_5-qubit_quantum_computer"]}
