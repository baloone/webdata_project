{"id":"337282258_Information_and_Education_Systems_in_the_Context_of_Digitalization_of_Education","abstract":"The article describes the changes in the modern socio-economic environment, which affect the digitalization of society, including the socio-educational sphere. On the basis of the authors’ proposals for the development of the concept of “information-educational systems”, mathematical models for their description and mechanisms for analysing their essential characteristics determined by modern processes of development and digitalization of society are indicated. Through the example of using elements of the theory of dynamic deductive databases and the theory of neural networks, the article describes mathematical models that adequately reflect strategies for the development of people and stable small groups, as well as large dynamic human communities, on the basis of which recommendations are proposed for developing such strategies. The results can be used in the pedagogical design of various models of educational activities and information and educational systems for various purposes, including education management and direct training. It also seems that the mechanisms and features of information and educational systems described in the article will allow us to establish an evidence-based educational policy at various levels in the context of digitalization","authors":["Sergey D.
