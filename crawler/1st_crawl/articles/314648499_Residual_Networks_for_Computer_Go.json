{"id":"314648499_Residual_Networks_for_Computer_Go","abstract":"Deep Learning for the game of Go recently had a tremendous success with the victory of AlphaGo against Lee Sedol in March 2016. We propose to use residual networks so as to improve the training of a policy network for computer Go. Training is faster than with usual convolutional networks and residual networks achieve high accuracy on our test set and a 4 dan level.","authors":["Tristan Cazenave"],"meta":["March 2017IEEE Transactions on Computational Intelligence and AI in Games PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TCIAIG.2017.2681042"],"references":["303409435_Residual_Networks_Behave_Like_Ensembles_of_Relatively_Shallow_Networks","292074166_Mastering_the_game_of_Go_with_deep_neural_networks_and_tree_search","284476411_Better_Computer_Go_Player_with_Neural_Network_and_Long-term_Prediction","269935589_Move_Evaluation_in_Go_Using_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","319770411_Torch7_A_Matlab-like_Environment_for_Machine_Learning","311609041_Deep_Residual_Learning_for_Image_Recognition","269417695_Teaching_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_to_Play_Go","29648128_Efficient_Selectivity_and_Backup_Operators_in_Monte-Carlo_Tree_Search"]}
