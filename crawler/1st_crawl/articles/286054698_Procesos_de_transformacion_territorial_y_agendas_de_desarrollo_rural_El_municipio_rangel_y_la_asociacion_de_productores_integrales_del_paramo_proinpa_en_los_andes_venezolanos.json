Which were the conditions that made possible the endogenous growth of some rural areas in Latin America, even under unfavorable market and policy conditions? From these processes, is it possible economic convergence and social cohesion at the national level? If this were possible, what are the necessary conditions for the design and successful implementation of a national policy on rural territorial development based on social cohesion and environmental sustainability criteria? The paper is structured in three parts. First of all, the analysis of a relatively successful process of territorial development in the Venezuelan Andes is made. Second, the analysis of different policy agendas, and their technical and institutional challenges are presented. Finally, the conclusions address the implications of these analyses for the design of public policy agendas.","authors":["Luis Llambi"],"meta":["July 2012Agroalimentaria 18(35):19-30"],"references":["229549271_Regional_Convergence_and_Economic_Performance_of_Peripheral_Areas_in_Turkey","273039897_Economic_Geography_and_Public_Policy","228030592_Policy_Reforms_and_Sustainable_Agricultural_Intensification_in_Africa","222559301_Channels_and_Policy_Debate_in_the_Globalisation-Inequality-Poverty_Nexus"]}
