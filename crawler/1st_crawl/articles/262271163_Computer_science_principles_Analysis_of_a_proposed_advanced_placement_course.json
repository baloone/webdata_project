{"id":"262271163_Computer_science_principles_Analysis_of_a_proposed_advanced_placement_course","abstract":"In this paper we analyze the CS Principles project, a proposed Advanced Placement course, by focusing on the second pilot that took place in 2011-2012. In a previous publication the first pilot of the course was explained, but not in a context related to relevant educational research and philosophy. In this paper we analyze the content and the pedagogical approaches used in the second pilot of the project. We include information about the third pilot being conducted in 2012-2013 and the portfolio exam that is part of that pilot. Both the second and third pilots provide evidence that the CS Principles course is succeeding in changing how computer science is taught and to whom it is taught.","authors":["Andrea Carol Arpaci-Dusseau","Owen L.
