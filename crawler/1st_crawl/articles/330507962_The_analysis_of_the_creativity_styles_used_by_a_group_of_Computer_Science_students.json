{"id":"330507962_The_analysis_of_the_creativity_styles_used_by_a_group_of_Computer_Science_students","abstract":"The study investigates the creativity styles used by a group of Computer Science students (N = 158; Mage = 20,99; 51 females) and examines the existence of a pattern of relations between creativity styles and self-evaluated creativity. The scale for Self-Perceived Creative Capacity (SPCC), the Creativity Styles Questionnaire (CSQ) for creation methods and a creative thinking test (UNU) have been used. The results show the students who consider themselves more creative report a certain creativity style such as (a) the use of techniques, (b) the use of unconscious processes, (c) the control of the environment and (d) the use of senses. The reliability values of the SPCC and the Creativity Styes Questionnaire subscales were similar to the reported in previous studies.","authors":["Beatrice Balgiu"],"meta":["January 2019"],"references":["315808795_Mental_imagery_and_creativity_A_meta-Analytic_review_study","271712136_A_Correlational_Study_of_Creativity_Happiness_Motivation_and_Stress_from_Creative_Pursuits","260289694_Differences_in_Thinking_Styles_of_Artists_and_Engineers","259502473_Development_and_validation_of_the_short_use_of_creative_cognition_scale_in_studying","288428545_The_Influence_of_Creative_Style_and_Climate_on_Software_Development_Team_Creativity_An_Exporatory_Study","280498239_Soft_Skills_and_Software_Development_A_Reflection_from_the_Software_Industry","272161791_Creativity_and_personality_profiles_of_adolescents_based_on_cyberbullying_roles","272123563_A_Self-Report_Measure_of_Cognitive_Processes_Associated_with_Creativity","270607045_What_makes_a_good_programmer","254269919_Physical_Order_Produces_Healthy_Choices_Generosity_and_Conventionality_Whereas_Disorder_Produces_Creativity"]}
