{"id":"348133586_ab-_Zagreb_index_of_some_special_graph","abstract":"In the past few years, graph theory has emerged as one of the most powerful mathematical tools to model many types of relations and process dynamics in computer science, biological and social systems. Generally, a graph is depicted as a set of nodes which is called vertices connected by lines are called edges. A topological index is the numerical parameter of a graph that characterizes its topology and it is usually graph invariant. In this paper, we compute some important classes vertex degree-based graph invariants using the Zagreb index of some special graphs such as the co-normal product of graphs, concentric wheels graph and intersection graph.","authors":["Prosanta Sarkar","Nilanjan De","Anita Pal","Sourav Mondal"],"meta":["January 2021Revue Roumaine de Chimie 65(11)","DOI:10.33224/rrch.2020.65.11.09"],"references":["326196178_Bounds_on_the_domination_number_and_the_metric_dimension_of_co-normal_product_of_graphs","325851779_Beyond_the_Zagreb_indices"]}
