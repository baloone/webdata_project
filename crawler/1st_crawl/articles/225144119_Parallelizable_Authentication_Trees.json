{"id":"225144119_Parallelizable_Authentication_Trees","abstract":"We define a new authentication tree in the symmetric key setting, which has the same computational time, storage and security\nparameters as the well known Merkle authentication tree, but which unlike the latter, allows for all the cryptographic operations\nrequired for an update to be performed in parallel. As in Merkle authentication trees, the cryptographic operations required\nfor verification can also be parallelized. In particular, we show a provably secure scheme for incremental MAC with partial\nauthentication secure against substitution and replay attacks, which on total data of size 2\nn\nblocks, and given n cryptographic engines, can compute incremental MACs and perform individual block authentication with a critical path of only\none cryptographic operation","authors":["W.
