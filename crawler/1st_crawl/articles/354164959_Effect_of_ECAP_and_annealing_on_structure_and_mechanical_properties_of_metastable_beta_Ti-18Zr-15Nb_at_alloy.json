{"id":"354164959_Effect_of_ECAP_and_annealing_on_structure_and_mechanical_properties_of_metastable_beta_Ti-18Zr-15Nb_at_alloy","abstract":"Effect of ECAP at 250 °C and annealing on structure and mechanical properties of the Ti-18Zr-15Nb biomedical alloy has been studied. The XRD and TEM data shows that ECAP leads to the formation of a predominantly nanocrystalline structure composed of equiaxed structure elements (grains and subgrains) of β-phase whose diameter ranges from 20 to 100 nm with some amount of α″- and ω-phases. In this structural state, the alloy exhibits high strength (YS=962 MPa, UTS=988 MPa). Additional annealing after ECAP at 525 °C (5 min) forms a submicrocrystalline structure (100-400 nm-diam. grains) of β-phase which promotes reducing of strength (YS=526 MPa, UTS=835 MPa) and increase in ductility.","authors":["Vadim Sheremetyev","Anna Churakova","M.
