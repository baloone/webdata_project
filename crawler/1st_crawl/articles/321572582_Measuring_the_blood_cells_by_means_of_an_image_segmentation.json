{"id":"321572582_Measuring_the_blood_cells_by_means_of_an_image_segmentation","abstract":"The analysis of the blood cells is used for evidencing several diseases in humans and animals. Usually, the analysis is performed manually by means of an optical microscope. However, some approaches, based on an automatic image processing, exist for evidencing and counting the blood cells in the given specimens. Measurements of the cell morphology are possible too. Here we show a method which uses a processing based on an image segmentation obtained by thresholding. After the segmentation, the area of the cells is easily evaluated. Their perimeters are measured using a rose of directions.","authors":["Amelia Carolina Sparavigna"],"meta":["December 2017","Project: Image Segmentation"],"references":["321209886_An_image_segmentation_for_the_measurement_of_microstructures_in_ductile_cast_iron","321049043_Image_Segmentation_Applied_to_the_Analysis_of_Fabric_Textures","319537882_Measuring_the_particles_in_fly_ash_by_means_of_an_image_segmentation","319537185_Measuring_the_size_of_tubules_in_phloem_and_xylem_of_plants","314126945_Image_Segmentation_Applied_to_the_Study_of_Micrographs_of_Cellular_Solids","313569115_Image_segmentation_applied_to_micrographs_of_microcellular_plastics","311737982_Analysis_of_a_natural_honeycomb_by_means_of_an_image_segmentation","311430540_A_method_for_the_segmentation_of_images_based_on_thresholding_and_applied_to_vesicular_textures","286723943_Automated_Red_Blood_Cells_Counting_in_Peripheral_Blood_Smear_Image_Using_Circular_Hough_Transform","286234121_Segmentation_using_morphological_watershed_transformation_for_counting_blood_cells"]}
