{"id":"326291863_The_Interaction_Human-Computer_and_its_Involvement_in_the_Change_of_Paradigms_of_Education","abstract":"The present article of reflection seeks to show how technology, especially the applications achieved through the HCI: Human Computer Interaction contributes to the strengthening of the teaching-learning process, to such an extent that some scholars even consider it as the emergence of a new pedagogy. Researchers in the field of HCI both observe the ways in which humans interact with computers and design technologies that let humans interact with computers in novel ways. As a field of research, human-computer interaction is situated at the intersection of computer science, behavioral sciences, design, media studies, and several other fields of study. With this purpose, some of the technological advances that we find today are portrayed at the expense of education and the way in which a technological era arises in the education of our country.","authors":["Francy ROCIO Chavarro Cardozo","Nestor Alonso Pach√≥n Pedraza","Ana Lucia Paque Salazar","Ruthber Rodriguez"],"meta":["July 2018Contemporary Engineering Sciences 11(50)","DOI:10.12988/ces.2018.85250"],"references":["351103098_Uso_de_interfaces_tangibles_en_la_ensenanza_de_lectura_a_ninos_con_sindrome_de_Down","338228156_Tendencias_emergentes_en_Educacion_con_TIC","324567508_Composition_of_the_phytoplankton_community_in_the_first_stages_of_the_Quimbo_dam_life_cycle_in_Huila_-_Colombia","324091535_Electrogenic_Biodegradation_Study_of_the_Carbofuran_Insecticide_in_Soil","323777417_Structure_of_the_phytoplanktonic_community_in_a_neotropical_Dam_with_environmental_tension","323760548_A_Review_of_the_Hotel_Sector_in_the_City_of_Neiva_and_the_Improvement_of_its_Competitiveness_through_Quality_Management_Systems","323753857_Association_between_dental_fluorosis_with_dental_caries_in_children_from_5_to_14_years_old_in_Huila's_public_educative_institutions_in_Colombia","323726922_Feasibility_Analysis_for_Creating_a_Metrology_Laboratory_Serving_the_Agribusiness_and_Hydrocarbons_in_the_Department_of_Huila_Colombia","323726874_Implementation_of_a_Model_of_Inventories_in_Five_Mipymes_in_the_City_of_Neiva_Republic_of_Colombia","323683231_Optimization_of_the_Paddy_Rice_Husking_Process_Increasing_the_useful_Life_of_the_Rollers_in_Florhuila_Plant_Campoalegre_Mills"]}
