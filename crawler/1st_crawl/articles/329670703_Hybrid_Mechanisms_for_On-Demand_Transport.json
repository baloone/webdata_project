{"id":"329670703_Hybrid_Mechanisms_for_On-Demand_Transport","abstract":"Market mechanisms are now playing a key role in the allocation and pricing of on-demand transportation services. In practice, most such services use posted-price mechanisms, where both passengers and drivers are offered a journey price which they can accept or reject. However, providers such as Liftago and GrabTaxi have begun to adopt a mechanism whereby auctions are used to price drivers. These latter mechanisms are neither posted-price nor classical double auctions and can instead be considered a hybrid mechanism. In this paper, we describe and study the properties of a novel hybrid on-demand transport mechanism. As these mechanisms require knowledge of passenger demand, we analyze the data-profit tradeoff as well as how the passenger and driver preferences influence mechanism performance. We show that the revenue loss for the provider scales with √nłog n for n passenger requests under a multi-armed bandit learning algorithm with beta-distributed preferences. We also investigate the effect of subsidies on both profit and the number of successful journeys allocated by the mechanism, comparing these with a posted-price mechanism, showing improvements in profit with a comparable number of successful requests.","authors":["Malcolm Egan","Nir Oren","Michal Jakob"],"meta":["January 2018IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems PP(99)","DOI:10.1109/TITS.2018.2886579"],"references":["317046536_An_agent-based_day-to-day_adjustment_process_for_modeling_'Mobility_as_a_Service'_with_a_two-sided_flexible_transport_market","317025034_Framework_for_automated_taxi_operation_The_family_model","306185976_Liftago_On-Demand_Transport_Dataset_and_Market_Formation_Algorithm_Based_on_Machine_Learning","300250695_A_Double_Auction_Mechanism_for_On-Demand_Transport_Networks","277501269_Interventions_to_Break_and_Create_Consumer_Habits","272479461_Dial-a-Ride_and_Emergency_Transportation_Problems_in_Ambulance_Services","265596511_A_Profit-Aware_Negotiation_Mechanism_for_On-Demand_Transport_Services","262535381_Agent-based_Simulation_Testbed_for_On-demand_Mobility_Services","262535347_Agent-based_Simulation_Testbed_for_On-demand_Transport_Services","256566822_Predicting_Taxi-Passenger_Demand_Using_Streaming_Data","234163991_Multi-agent_real_time_scheduling_system_for_taxi_companies","224603611_A_Collaborative_Multiagent_Taxi-Dispatch_System","223369558_The_pickup_and_delivery_problem_with_time_windows","221234600_Real-time_trip_information_service_for_a_large_taxi_fleet","220813396_A_Mechanism_for_Dynamic_Ride_Sharing_Based_on_Parallel_Auctions","220343796_Finite-time_Analysis_of_the_Multiarmed_Bandit_Problem","220244405_Dynamic_Pricing_Without_Knowing_the_Demand_Function_Risk_Bounds_and_Near-Optimal_Algorithms","320293364_An_Efficient_Ride-Sharing_Framework_for_Maximizing_Shared_Route","317555564_An_Efficient_Double_Auction_Mechanism_for_On-Demand_Transport_Services_in_Cloud-Based_Mobile_Commerce","317158681_Game-Theoretic_Considerations_for_Optimizing_Taxi_System_Efficiency","316722322_Understanding_ride-on-demand_service_Demand_and_dynamic_pricing","314794431_Congregating_and_market_formation","306419372_Economic_analysis_of_ride-sourcing_markets","305826643_Pricing_strategies_for_a_taxi-hailing_platform","293639861_Discrete-Event_System_Simulation","291005041_A_Multi-agent_Approach_to_the_Dynamic_Vehicle_Routing_Problem_with_Time_Windows","288059427_A_Discounted_Trade_Reduction_Mechanism_for_Dynamic_Ridesharing_Pricing","262221632_Optimal_pricing_for_improving_efficiency_of_taxi_systems","256227688_A_dominant_strategy_double_auction","231184176_Mixed-reality_testbeds_for_incremental_development_of_HART_applications","228217170_Optimal_Multi-Period_Pricing_with_Service_Guarantees","227992567_Elements_of_Information_Theory","227427064_Equilibrium_properties_of_taxi_markets_with_search_frictions","223049472_Demand-supply_equilibrium_of_taxi_services_in_a_network_under_competition_and_regulation","222826935_A_simulation_study_of_demand_responsive_transit_system_design","222292720_The_Generalized_Beta_as_a_Model_for_the_Distribution_of_Earnings","221996242_Nonlinear_pricing_of_taxi_services","220462650_The_dial-a-ride_problem_DARP_Models_and_algorithms","220244046_A_Multiperiod_Dynamic_Model_of_Taxi_Services_with_Endogenous_Service_Intensity","46491804_Dynamic_pickup_and_delivery_problems","23526461_A_simulation_model_for_evaluating_advanced_dial-a-ride_paratransit_systems","23526453_Multi-modal_and_demand-responsive_passenger_transport_systems_A_modelling_framework_with_embedded_control_systems","4980606_Auctions_versus_Posted-Price_Selling","4180753_MADARP_Multi-agent_architecture_for_passenger_transportation_systems","4038179_The_Value_of_Knowing_a_Demand_Curve_Bounds_on_Regret_for_Online_Posted-Price_Auctions","2373993_Algorithmic_Mechanism_Design"]}
