{"id":"341711550_A_Model_of_Computation-based_Naming_System_for_Musical_Elements_of_Java_Traditional_Song","abstract":"In a research which involves mathematics and music, information of pitch, such as note, bars, melody line, beat, tempo, and others, was used as dataset to be processed by computer in generating or predicting musical objects. Helmholtz notation and scientific pitch notation used in western music are formal notation writing systems that have been applied in the computer science research as in the topics of algorithmic composition or music information retrieval. A Model of computation-based naming system for musical elements of Java traditional song called gendhing scientific pitch notation or GSPN was proposed to provide a method of information data recording of pitch in a term that can be read and write by human and computer. The method was conducted in two phases, which were Identification of musical elements and formulation of computation-based naming system. The model was successfully implemented in a simple computer program that has a task to read a data in GSPN format and to write by generating a music sheet based on the input data.","authors":["Arry Maulana Syarif","Azhari Azhari","Suprapto Suprapto","Khafiizh Hastuti"],"meta":["May 2020IOP Conference Series Materials Science and Engineering 803(1):012031","DOI:10.1088/1757-899X/803/1/012031"],"references":["220202336_Markov_Constraints_Steerable_Generation_of_Markov_Sequences","318926743_Rule-Based_and_Genetic_Algorithm_for_Automatic_Gamelan_Music_Composition","316028427_Building_Melodic_Feature_Knowledge_of_Gamelan_Music_Using_Apriori_Based_on_Functions_in_Sequence_AFiS_Algorithm","221620425_HARMONET_A_neural_net_for_harmonizing_chorales_in_the_style_of_J_S_Bach"]}
