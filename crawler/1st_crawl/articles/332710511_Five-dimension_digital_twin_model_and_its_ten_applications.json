{"id":"332710511_Five-dimension_digital_twin_model_and_its_ten_applications","abstract":"As an enabling technology for implementing smart manufacturing, industrial 4.0, industrial internet and smart city, digital twin has received great attention from both academics and industry, especially its industrial applications. Model is the foundation and core of digital twin theories and technologies, but the traditional three-dimension digital twin model can no longer meet the new application requirements and technology development trends. To promote the application of digital twin in more fields, a five-dimension digital twin model was put forward in authors' previous research to digital twin shop-floor. In view of the new demands on digital twin and based on the previous research, a more systematic five-dimension digital twin model was presented. Furthermore, its applications in ten fields were discussed, including satellite/space communication network, ships, vehicles, power plant, aircraft, complex equipment, stereoscopic warehouse, medical, shop-floor and smart city, which could provide theoretical and methodological references for the application of digital twin in the future.","authors":["F.
