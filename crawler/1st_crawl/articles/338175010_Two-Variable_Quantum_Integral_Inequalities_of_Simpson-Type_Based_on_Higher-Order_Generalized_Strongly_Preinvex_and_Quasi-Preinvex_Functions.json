{"id":"338175010_Two-Variable_Quantum_Integral_Inequalities_of_Simpson-Type_Based_on_Higher-Order_Generalized_Strongly_Preinvex_and_Quasi-Preinvex_Functions","abstract":"In this paper, we present a new definition of higher-order generalized strongly preinvex functions. Moreover, it is observed that the new class of higher-order generalized strongly preinvex functions characterize various new classes as special cases. We acquire a new q 1 q 2-integral identity, then employing this identity, we establish several two-variable q 1 q 2-integral inequalities of Simpson-type within a class of higher-order generalized strongly preinvex and quasi-preinvex functions. Finally, the utilities of our numerical approximations have concrete applications.","authors":["Humaira Kalsoom","Saima Rashid","Muhammad Idrees","Yuming Chu"],"meta":["December 2019Symmetry 12(1)","DOI:10.3390/sym12010051","Project: Quantum Integral Inequalities"],"references":["337895250_Inequalities_by_Means_of_Generalized_Proportional_Fractional_Integral_Operators_with_Respect_to_Another_Function","337487113_Fractional_Integral_Inequalities_for_Strongly_h-Preinvex_Functions_for_a_kth_Order_Differentiable_Functions","337203453_A_note_on_generalized_convex_functions","336518879_Some_New_Quantum_Hermite-Hadamard-Type_Estimates_Within_a_Class_of_Generalized_sm-Preinvex_Functions","335790131_Some_Hermite-Hadamard_type_integral_inequalities_whose_n-times_differentiable_functions_are_s-logarithmically_convex_functions","335578135_Some_Estimates_for_Generalized_Riemann-Liouville_Fractional_Integrals_of_Exponentially_Convex_Functions_and_Their_Applications","335238967_Quantum_Integral_Inequalities_of_Simpson-Type_for_Strongly_Preinvex_Functions","335094233_On_Some_New_Weighted_Inequalities_for_Differentiable_Exponentially_Convex_and_Exponentially_Quasi-Convex_Functions_with_Applications","334813084_Some_pq-Estimates_of_Hermite-Hadamard-Type_Inequalities_for_Coordinated_Convex_and_Quasi-_Convex_Functions","334697187_Simpsons_type_integral_inequalities_for_kappa-fractional_integrals_and_their_applications"]}
