{"id":"351452048_Music_Technology_Education_and_a_Plugin-Based_Platform_as_a_Tool_to_Enhance_Creativity_Multidisciplinarity_Creative_Design_and_Collaboration_Skills","abstract":"Music technology is known to have the ability to enhance creativity and creative development among students. A high level of engagement has been shown among students who studied and developed musical projects, and among students who were intellectually involved in the process of meaningful exploration. When students develop a music technology project, they use their software design skills to build and combine different artistic and computational components. Here we present a creative education method for computer science and software engineering students, it uses Muzilator, a plugin-based web platform that enables developers to develop a project as a set of independent web applications (plugins). Students can share their plugins with others or use plugins developed by others. We examined 75 projects of teams of computer science students who participated in a Computer Music course. We studied the characteristics of these projects and Muzilatorâ€™s effectiveness as a creative education and collaboration tool. Some of our results show that Muzilator-based projects received higher creativity and multidisciplinarity ratings than did other projects, and that high-risk projects were more creative and artistic than low-risk ones. We also found a gender-dependency: women tended more than men to develop interactive applications, while men tended to choose more theoretic (algorithmic), non-interactive projects.","authors":["Or Peretz"],"meta":["April 2021Journal of Education and Practice 12(11):1-12","DOI:10.7176/JEP/12-11-01","Project: Music Technology Education"],"references":["321953973_Mobile_Music_Sensors_Physical_Modeling_and_Digital_Fabrication_Articulating_the_Augmented_Mobile_Instrument","285236009_A_Methodological_Framework_for_Teaching_Evaluating_and_Informing_NIME_Design_with_a_Focus_on_Expressiveness_and_Mapping","275068070_Fostering_the_Creative_Development_of_Computer_Science_Students_in_Programming_and_Interaction_Design","262218976_Utilizing_music_technology_as_a_model_for_creativity_development_in_K-12_education","261674921_Motivational_Active_Learning_-_Engaging_University_Students_in_Computer_Science_Education","322711328_A_Study_of_Creativity_in_CaC2_Steamship-derived_STEM_Project-based_Learning","282949778_The_three_factors_of_creativity_management_Visual_number_and_word_creativity","280685679_A_creative_personality_scale_for_the_Adjective_Check_List","272541080_A_New_Asymmetric_Measure_of_Association_for_Ordinal_Variables","265086460_How_to_Design_and_Evaluate_Research_in_Education","260064848_The_Effect_of_Project_Based_Learning_Model_with_KWL_Worksheet_on_Student_Creative_Thinking_Process_in_Physics_Problems","254301596_The_Standard_Definition_of_Creativity","247807751_General_Artistic_and_Scientific_Creativity_Attributes_of_Engineering_and_Music_Students","246597223_K-W-L_A_Teaching_Model_That_Develops_Active_Reading_of_Expository_Text","242512892_A_New_Measure_of_Rank_Correlation"]}
