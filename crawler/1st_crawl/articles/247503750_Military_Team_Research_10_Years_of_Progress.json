{"id":"247503750_Military_Team_Research_10_Years_of_Progress","abstract":"The military is growing increasingly dependent on the ability of individuals to coalesce quickly into effective teams. Consequently, there is a need for scientists to develop an understanding of the processes that influence team performance so that appropriate training can be developed. The authors describe the progress that has been made toward this goal. A historical perspective is provided for each of 4 critical factors in team performance: theoretical development, critical team processes, measurement, and training. A review of what has been learned from military team research in each of these areas since J. Dyer's (1984) review and directions for future research are presented.
