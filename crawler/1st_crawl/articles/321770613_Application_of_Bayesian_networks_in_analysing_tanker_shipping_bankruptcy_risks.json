{"id":"321770613_Application_of_Bayesian_networks_in_analysing_tanker_shipping_bankruptcy_risks","abstract":"Purpose\n\nThis study aims to develop an assessment methodology using a Bayesian network (BN) to predict the failure probability of oil tanker shipping firms.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\n\nThis paper proposes a bankruptcy prediction model by applying the hybrid of logistic regression and Bayesian probabilistic networks.\n\nFindings\n\nThe proposed model shows its potential of contributing to a powerful tool to predict financial bankruptcy of shipping operators, and provides important insights to the maritime community as to what performance measures should be taken to ensure the shipping companiesâ€™ financial soundness under dynamic environments.\n\nResearch limitations/implications\n\nThe model and its associated variables can be expanded to include more factors for an in-depth analysis in future when the detailed information at firm level becomes available.\n\nPractical implications\n\nThe results of this study can be implemented to oil tanker shipping firms as a prediction tool for bankruptcy rate.\n\nOriginality/value\n\nIncorporating quantitative statistical measurement, the application of BN in financial risk management provides advantages to develop a powerful early warning system in shipping, which has unique characteristics such as capital intensive and mobile assets, possibly leading to catastrophic consequences.","authors":["Grace Wen-Yao Wang","Zhisen Yang","Di Zhang","Anqiang Huang"],"meta":["September 2017Maritime Business Review 2(3):177-198","DOI:10.1108/MABR-12-2016-0032"],"references":["311958084_Solvency_and_Liquidity_in_Shipping_Companies","272498933_The_relative_efficiency_and_financial_risk_assessment_of_shipping_companies","258398614_Risks_Analysis_of_Logistics_Financial_Business_Based_on_Evidential_Bayesian_Network","251621823_The_financial_crisis_in_an_operational_risk_management_context-A_review_of_causes_and_influencing_factors","315409244_Too_Many_to_Fail_-_An_Analysis_of_Time-inconsistency_in_Bank_Closure_Policies","314906276_Unstable_Banking","305445515_Predicting_corporate_financial_distress_using_data_mining_techniques_An_application_in_Tehran_Stock_Exchange","287180824_Bayesian_Networks_and_Decision_Graphs","281475324_A_Comparison_of_the_Ratios_of_Successful_Industrial_Enterprises_with_Those_of_Failed_Companies","256022683_Capital_Structure_Decisions_of_Globally-Listed_Shipping_Companies"]}
