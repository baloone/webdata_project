{"id":"257371489_Configuration_through_the_parameterization_of_building_components","abstract":"Many construction companies have developed building systems, based on prefabrication strategies, to enhance productivity. Current practice coupled with the difficulties of introducing these systems early in the design process often leads to ad hoc solutions and problems downstream along the value chain. In 2008 a multi-storey timber building system based on modularization principles was developed. The customization process used in this system is illustrated herein using a configurable timber floor slab module. The downstream flow of design information and upstream flow of constraints on, and rules for, the building system are described from three product viewpoints: the customer view, the engineering view and the production view. Using a manufacturing CAD tool, design automation is implemented in the engineering view and connected to an architectural CAD tool. The demonstration software shows that manufacturing CAD tools can be used to create design automation alternatives for modularized building systems within the construction industry.","authors":["Patrik Jensen","Thomas Olofsson","Helena Johnsson"],"meta":["May 2012Automation in Construction 23:1â€“8","DOI:10.1016/j.autcon.2011.11.016"],"references":["313196208_Interoperability_challenges_of_an_engineering_software_provider","288945921_Product_development_through_lean_design_and_modularization_principles","281596020_Interoperability_in_practice_Geometric_data_exchange_using_the_IFC_standard","235909297_Product_modeling_of_configurable_building_systems_-_A_case_study","233566842_Models_of_manufacturing_and_the_construction_process_The_genesis_of_re-engineering_construction","229005009_Information_management_in_industrial_housing_design_and_manufacture","228363159_Knowledge-based_engineering_in_construction_The_prefabricated_timber_housing_case","249892959_Virtual_Design_and_Construction_Themes_Case_Studies_and_Implementation_Suggestions","223184300_Using_XML_to_support_information_exchange_in_construction_projects","222543341_Building_assembly_detailing_using_constraint-based_modeling","31746339_Product_Design_and_Development_KT_Ulrich_SD_Eppinger","30870424_Why_can't_CAD_be_more_like_Lego_CKB_a_program_for_building_construction_kits"]}
