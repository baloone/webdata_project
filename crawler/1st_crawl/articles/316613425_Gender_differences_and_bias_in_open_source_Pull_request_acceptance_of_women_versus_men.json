{"id":"316613425_Gender_differences_and_bias_in_open_source_Pull_request_acceptance_of_women_versus_men","abstract":"Biases against women in the workplace have been documented in a variety of studies. This paper presents a large scale study on gender bias, where we compare acceptance rates of contributions from men versus women in an open source software community. Surprisingly, our results show that women’s contributions tend to be accepted more often than men’s. However, for contributors who are outsiders to a project and their gender is identifiable, men’s acceptance rates are higher. Our results suggest that although women on GitHub may be more competent overall, bias against them exists nonetheless.","authors":["Josh Terrell","Andrew Kofink","Justin Middleton","Clarissa Rainear"],"meta":["May 2017PeerJ Computer Science 3(1):e111","DOI:10.7717/peerj-cs.111"],"references":["291206543_Wait_for_It_Determinants_of_Pull_Request_Evaluation_Latency_on_GitHub","271386249_We_Have_to_Try_Harder_Gender_and_Required_Work_Effort_in_Britain_and_the_United_States","271137551_Gender_and_Tenure_Diversity_in_GitHub_Teams","266656199_An_exploratory_study_of_the_pull-based_software_development_model","264799490_Lean_GHTorrent_GitHub_data_on_demand","261479894_The_GHTorent_dataset_and_tool_suite","257163012_Gender_Representation_and_Online_Participation_A_Quantitative_Study","242405574_A_Cyberfeminist_Utopia_Perceptions_of_Gender_and_Computer_Science_among_Malaysian_Women_Computer_Science_Students_and_Faculty","233195891_Science_Faculty's_Subtle_Gender_Biases_Favor_Male_Students","232541633_Gender_Differences_in_Risk_Taking_A_Meta-Analysis","227450987_MatchIT_Nonparametric_Preprocessing_for_Parametric_Causal_Inference","227020448_Measuring_Relative_Attack_Surfaces","222587227_Sex_Discrimination_in_Simulated_Employment_Contexts_A_Meta-analytic_Investigation","221995234_Controlling_The_False_Discovery_Rate_-_A_Practical_And_Powerful_Approach_To_Multiple_Testing","221494795_Gender_differences_and_programming_environments_Across_programming_populations","221367690_Gender_differences_in_Wikipedia_editing","329476370_Controlling_the_False_Discovery_Rate_A_Practical_and_Powerful_Approach_to_Multiple_Testing","303065535_Harvesting_implicit_group_attitudes_and_beliefs_from_a_demonstration_website","288704182_Free_as_in_sexist_Free_culture_and_the_garden_gap","272953516_Selection_of_Patients_for_Coronary_Angiography_and_Coronary_Revascularization_Early_after_Myocardial_Infarction_Is_There_Evidence_for_a_Gender_Bias","261547178_Spotlighting_Emergent_Gender_Bias_in_Undergraduate_Engineering_Education","258186601_The_Matilda_Effect_in_Science_Communication_An_Experiment_on_Gender_Bias_in_Publication_Quality_Perceptions_and_Collaboration_Interest","258173849_'Patches_don't_have_gender'_What_is_not_open_in_open_source_software","247643416_Personality_and_Background_Characteristics_of_Women_in_Male-Dominated_Occupations_A_Review","247570318_A_Meta-Analysis_of_Gender_Group_Differences_for_Measures_of_Job_Performance_in_Field_Studies","243697182_The_Use_of_Confidence_or_Fiducial_Limits_Illustrated_in_the_Case_of_Binomial","232418047_Race_and_Gender_Bias_in_the_Administration_of_Corporal_Punishment","227844650_Stereotypes_Bias_and_Personnel_Decisions_Strange_and_Stranger","222148317_Gender_differences_in_employment_and_earnings_in_science_and_engineering_in_the_US","220440754_Predicting_risk_of_software_changes","23992065_ICTs_Gender_and_Development_Women_in_Software_Production_in_Kerala","15184371_Is_there_gender_bias_in_JAMA's_peer_review_process","15084492_What_Gives_a_Face_its_Gender","11783499_Cohort_studies_History_of_the_method_II_Retrospective_cohort_studies","8545836_Penalties_for_Success_Reactions_to_Women_Who_Succeed_at_Male_Gender-Typed_Tasks"]}
