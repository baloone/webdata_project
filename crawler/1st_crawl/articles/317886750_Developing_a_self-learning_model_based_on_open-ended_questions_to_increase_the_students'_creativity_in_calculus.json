{"id":"317886750_Developing_a_self-learning_model_based_on_open-ended_questions_to_increase_the_students'_creativity_in_calculus","abstract":"This article reports on research that is aimed at developing and producing a self-learning model based on\nopen-ended questions or the PMBST (accronym form Indonesian) model to increase students’ creativity in a calculus subject. The main product generated is a book on the PMBST model. It consists of: a) introduction; b) theoretical rationality; c) empirical rationality; d) supporting theories; e) components of the model; f) instructions for the model; and g) bibliography. Furthermore, to assess the quality of this model, the authors used product quality assessment criteria created by Nieveen, which covers hypothetical validity and practicality. The instrument, which is developed form supporting the PMBST model development cover: an assessment sheet of the PMBST model, and a validation format ofthe PMBST model assessment sheet. The subjects of the PMBST model in this research are Master’s programme students in the Mathematics Department at Universitas Negeri Makassar who have finished or are learning the calculus subject. The result of this research is the PMBST model developed with high theoretical rationality as indicated by experts’ assessments.","authors":["Nurdin Arsyad","Abdul Rahman","Ansari Saleh Ahmar"],"meta":["May 2017Global Journal of Engineering Education 19(2)","DOI:10.26858/gjeev19i2y2017p143147"],"references":["315379118_Analysis_of_the_ability_in_mathematical_problem-solving_based_on_SOLO_taxonomy_and_cognitive_style","315378811_Relationship_between_learning_styles_and_learning_achievement_in_mathematics_based_on_genders","313861154_Development_of_teaching_material_using_an_Android","308582719_Exploration_of_Mathematics_Problem_Solving_Process_Based_on_The_Thinking_Level_of_Students_in_Junior_High_School","308483964_The_influence_of_cooperative_learning_models_on_learning_outcomes_based_on_students'_learning_styles","293302779_An_Introduction_to_Educational_Research","285603507_Analysis_understanding_of_the_smp_students_build_concept_and_principles_of_flat_in_math","248916571_Cognitive_Development_in_Children","247205949_A_viewpoint_in_theory_and_experimentation_on_human_learning_and_thinking","235465787_A_Taxonomy_for_Learning_Teaching_and_Assessing_A_Revision_of_Bloom's_Taxonomy_of_Educational_Objectives"]}
