{"id":"265356186_An_algebraic_approach_to_association_schemes_and_coding_theory","abstract":"The present work is a contribution to the algebraic theory of association schemes, where special emphasis is put on concepts arising from the theory of error correcting codes and of some combinatorial designs. The main idea is to characterize a subset in a given association scheme by its distribution with respect to the relations of the scheme. This yields some powerful methods for the study of subsets whose specific properties can be expressed in terms of their distribution. Various theorems are obtained in this way about generalized concepts of codes and t designs.","authors":["Ph. Delsarte"],"meta":["January 1973"],"references":[]}
