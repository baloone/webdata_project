In the sequel we prove some of the main theorems by generalized\ncontractions for getting fixed points and common fixed points for mappings.","authors":["Mehdi Asadi","Erdal Karapinar","Peyman Salimi"],"meta":["January 2014Journal of Inequalities and Applications 2014(1)","DOI:10.1186/1029-242X-2014-18"],"references":["257878485_Coincidence_and_fixed_point_results_for_generalized_weak_contractions_in_the_sense_of_Berinde_on_partial_metric_spaces","257003400_Be_careful_on_partial_metric_fixed_point_results","227656324_Partial_Metric_Topology"]}
