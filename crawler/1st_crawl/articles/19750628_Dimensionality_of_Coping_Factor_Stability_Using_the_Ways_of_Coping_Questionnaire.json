{"id":"19750628_Dimensionality_of_Coping_Factor_Stability_Using_the_Ways_of_Coping_Questionnaire","abstract":"This study presents convergent support for the use of five empirically constructed factors from the \"Ways of Coping Questionnaire.\" Five coping factors were congruents with the factors reported in a study conducted by Folkman and Lazarus in 1985. The results support a concept of coping as defined by the factors, for student populations. Researchers need to explore different coping contexts to facilitate research and increase our knowledge of coping processes.","authors":["ROBERT F. SCHERER","FRANK A. WIEBE","DAVID C.
