{"id":"272175075_On_Fractional_Metric_Dimension_of_Graphs","abstract":"A vertex x in a connected graph G = (V, E) is said to resolve a pair {u, v} of vertices of G if the distance from u to x is not equal to the distance from v to x. The resolving neighborhood for the pair {u, v} is defined as R{u, v} = {x ∈ V : d(u, x) ≠ d(v, x)}. A real valued function f : V → [0, 1] is a resolving function (RF) of G if f(R{u, v}) ≥ 1 for any two distinct vertices u, v ∈ V. The weight of f is defined by |f| = f(V) = ∑u∈Vf(v). The fractional metric dimension dimf(G) is defined by dimf(G) = min{|f| : f is a resolving function of G}. In this paper, we characterize graphs G for which . We also present several results on fractional metric dimension of Cartesian product of two connected graphs.\n\nRead More: http://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S1793830913500377?journalCode=dmaa","authors":["S.
