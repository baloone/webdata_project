{"id":"286683643_A_multi-agent_system_for_the_production_control_of_printed_circuit_boards_using_JaCaMo_and_Prometheus_AEOlus","abstract":"This article presents a proposal for a multi-agent system for controlling the production of printed circuit boards in small series based on a new multi-agent approach. The multi-agent system was designed following the methodology Prometheus AEOlus and implemented using the framework JaCaMo. Unlike other multi-agent system used to control the production of printed circuit boards that are based on the agent-oriented paradigm, this system was completely designed and implemented using an integrated platform that follows the multi-agent oriented paradigm: the framework JaCaMo. So far this is the only implementation of this approach in the small series production.","authors":["Mario Lucio Roloff","Marcelo R.
