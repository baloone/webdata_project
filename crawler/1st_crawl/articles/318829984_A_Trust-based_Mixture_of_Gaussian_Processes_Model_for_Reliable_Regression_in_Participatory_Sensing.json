{"id":"318829984_A_Trust-based_Mixture_of_Gaussian_Processes_Model_for_Reliable_Regression_in_Participatory_Sensing","abstract":"Data trustworthiness is a crucial issue in real-world participatory sensing applications. Without considering this issue, different types of worker misbehavior, especially the challenging collusion attacks, can result in biased and inaccurate estimation and decision making. We propose a novel trust-based mixture of Gaussian processes (GP) model for spatial regression to jointly detect such misbehavior and accurately estimate the spatial field. We develop a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-based algorithm to efficiently perform Bayesian inference of the model. Experiments using two real-world datasets show the superior robustness of our model compared with existing approaches.","authors":["Qikun Xiang","Jie Zhang","Ido Nevat","Pengfei Zhang"],"meta":["August 2017","DOI:10.24963/ijcai.2017/540","Conference: Twenty-Sixth International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence"],"references":["299450013_An_Algorithm_to_Coordinate_Measurements_using_Stochastic_Human_Mobility_Patterns_in_Large-Scale_Participatory_Sensing_Settings","277281194_Coordinating_Measurements_for_Air_Pollution_Monitoring_in_Participatory_Sensing_Settings","299449247_Bayesian_modelling_of_community-based_multidimensional_trust_in_participatory_sensing_under_data_sparsity","262526437_Dynamic_estimation_of_worker_reliability_in_crowdsourcing_for_regression_tasks_Making_it_work","262319842_Trust-Based_Fusion_of_Untrustworthy_Information_in_Crowdsourcing_Applications","261463063_ARTSense_Anonymous_Reputation_and_Trust_in_Participatory_Sensing","221678220_Robust_Estimation_of_a_Location_Parameter"]}
