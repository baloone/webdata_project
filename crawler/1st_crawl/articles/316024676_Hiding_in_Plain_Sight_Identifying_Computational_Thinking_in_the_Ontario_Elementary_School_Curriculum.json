{"id":"316024676_Hiding_in_Plain_Sight_Identifying_Computational_Thinking_in_the_Ontario_Elementary_School_Curriculum","abstract":"Given a growing digital economy with complex problems, demands are being made for education to addresscomputational thinking (CT) â€“ an approach to problem solving that draws on the tenets of computer science. Weconducted a comprehensive content analysis of the Ontario elementary school curriculum documents for 44 CT-relatedterms to examine the extent to which CT may already be considered within the curriculum. The quantitative analysisstrategy provided frequencies of terms, and a qualitative analysis provided information about how and where termswere being used. As predicted, results showed that while CT terms appeared mostly in Mathematics, and concepts andperspectives were more frequently cited than practices, related terms appeared across almost all disciplines and grades.Findings suggest that CT is already a relevant consideration for educators in terms of concepts and perspectives;however, CT practices should be more widely incorporated to promote 21st century skills across disciplines. Futureresearch would benefit from continued examination of the implementation and assessment of CT and its relatedconcepts, practices, and perspectives.","authors":["Eden Hennessey","Julie Mueller","Danielle Beckett","Peter A.
