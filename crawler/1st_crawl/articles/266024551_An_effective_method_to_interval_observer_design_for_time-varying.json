{"id":"266024551_An_effective_method_to_interval_observer_design_for_time-varying","abstract":"An interval observer for Linear Time-Varying (LTV) systems is proposed in this paper. Usually, the design of such observers is based on monotone systems theory. Monotone properties are hard to satisfy in many situations. To overcome this issue, in a recent work, it has been shown that under some restrictive conditions, the cooperativity of an LTV system can be ensured by a static linear transformation of coordinates. However, a constructive method for the construction of the transformation matrix and the observer gain, making the observation error dynamics positive and stable, is still missing and remains an open problem. In this paper, a constructive approach to obtain a time-varying change of coordinates, ensuring the cooperativity of the observer error in the new coordinates, is provided. The efficiency of the proposed approach is shown through computer simulations.","authors":["Rihab El Houda Thabet","Tarek Raissi","Christophe Combastel","Denis Efimov"],"meta":["October 2014Automatica 50(10)","DOI:10.1016/j.automatica.2014.08.035"],"references":["268346219_State_and_Parameter_Estimation_for_Nonlinearly_Parameterized_Systems_An_H_-Based_Approach","261051513_On_Set-Membership_Observer_Design_for_a_Class_of_Periodical_Time-Varying_Systems","228334083_Positive_observers_for_linear_positive_systems_and_their_implications","224367851_Tight_robust_interval_observers_An_LP_approach","224093681_Asymptotically_Stable_Interval_Observers_for_Planar_Systems_With_Complex_Poles","223318263_Robustness_of_Luenberger_observers_Linear_systems_stabilized_via_non-linear_control","220387060_Interval_State_Estimation_for_a_Class_of_Nonlinear_Systems","29612831_Polytopic_Observer_Design_for_LPV_Systems_Based_on_Minimal_Convex_Polytope_Finding","3892262_State_estimation_for_affine_LPV_system","3032857_On_Unscented_Kalman_Filtering_for_State_Estimation_of_Continuous-Time_Nonlinear_Systems","277672023_Algorithm_852","273129880_Applied_Interval_Analysis_Springer_London","271492376_A_Stable_Interval_Observer_for_LTI_Systems_with_No_Multiple_Poles","261484105_Design_of_interval_observers_for_LPV_systems_subject_to_exogenous_disturbances","256660860_Interval_State_Observer_for_Nonlinear_Time_Varying_Systems","243783894_Monotone_Dynamical_Systems_An_Introduction_to_the_Theory_of_Competitive_and_Cooperative_Systems","242985117_Unified_canonical_forms_for_matrices_over_a_differential_ring","235355960_Stable_Interval_Observers_in_BBC_for_Linear_Systems_With_Time-Varying_Input_Bounds","224388069_Robustness_of_Luenberger_Observers_Linear_Systems_Stabilized_via_Nonlinear_Control","222830810_Nonlinear_bounded-error_state_estimation_of_continuous-time_systems","222612499_Interval_Observer_Design_for_Consistency_Checks_of_Nonlinear_Continuous-Time_Systems","222350454_Closed_loop_observers_bundle_for_uncertain_biotechnical_models","220492918_Algorithm_852_RealPaver_an_interval_solver_using_constraint_satisfaction_techniques","220159595_Interval_observers_for_linear_time-invariant_systems_with_disturbances","220157728_Near_optimal_interval_observers_bundle_for_uncertain_bioreactors","3500262_Unified_canonical_forms_for_linear_time-varying_dynamical_systems_under_D-similarity_transformations_I","3500253_Unified_canonical_forms_for_linear_time-varying_dynamical_systemsunder_D-similarity_transformations_II","3022449_Necessary_and_sufficient_conditions_for_quadratic_stability_and_stabilizability_of_uncertain_linear_time-varying_systems"]}
