{"id":"220316158_On_very_high_degrees","abstract":"In this paper we show that there is a pair of superhigh r.e. degree that forms a minimal pair. An analysis of the proof shows that a critical ingredient is the growth rates of certain order functions. This leads us to investigate\ncertain high r.e. degrees, which resemble ∅’ very closely in terms of ∅’-jump traceability. In particular, we will construct an ultrahigh degree which is cappable.","authors":["Keng Meng Ng"],"meta":["March 2008Journal of Symbolic Logic 73(1):309-342","DOI:10.2178/jsl/1208358755","SourceDBLP"],"references":["243777199_Weak_recursive_degrees_and_a_problem_of_Spector","220368969_A_Cappable_Almost_Everywhere_Dominating_Computably_Enumerable_Degree","37987805_Reals_which_Compute_Little","31268487_Using_random_sets_as_oracles","313627562_Lowness_notions_measure_and_domination","305943874_Logic_Computability_and_Randomness","274168823_Pseudojump_operators_I_The_re_case","264743044_Lowness_notions_measure_and_domination","257762003_Strong_jump-traceability_II_K-triviality","243066649_Low_for_random_reals_and_positive-measure_domination","240482482_Draft_of_a_paper_or_series_of_papers_on_Chaitin''''s_work","238303893_Pseudo-jump_operators_I_The_re_case","229708823_Classes_of_Recursively_Enumerable_Sets_and_Degrees_of_Unsolvability","222691494_Lowness_properties_and_randomness","222450753_Information_theoretic_characterizations_of_infinite_strings","220394377_Completing_pseudojump_operators","220394148_Lowness_properties_and_approximations_of_the_jump","220315613_Uniform_almost_everywhere_domination","220083458_Almost_everywhere_domination_and_superhighness","38338866_Almost_everywhere_domination","36099187_Randomness_and_genericity_in_the_degrees_of_unsolvability","2790438_Algorithmic_Randomness_and_Lowness","2623581_Computational_Randomness_and_Lowness"]}
