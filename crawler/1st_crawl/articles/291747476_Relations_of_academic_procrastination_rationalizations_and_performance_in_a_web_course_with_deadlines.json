{"id":"291747476_Relations_of_academic_procrastination_rationalizations_and_performance_in_a_web_course_with_deadlines","abstract":"This study compared students' academic procrastination tendency with the (1) frequency and nature of rationalizations used to justify procrastination, (2) self-regulation, and (3) performance in a web-based study strategies course with frequent performance deadlines. 106 college students completed the 16-item Tuckman Procrastination Scale, a measure of tendency to procrastinate, the Frequency of Use Self-survey of Rationalizations for Procrastination, and a 9-item self-regulation scale. Students' subsequent course performance was measured by total points earned. A linear regression with Academic Procrastination as the criterion variable and Rationalization score and Course Points as the predictor variables suggested academic procrastinators support procrastinating by rationalizing, not self-regulating, and thus put themselves at a disadvantage, with respect to evaluation in highly structured courses with frequent enforced deadlines.","authors":["BW Tuckman"],"meta":["June 2005Psychological Reports 96(3):1015-1021","DOI:10.2466/pr0.96.3c.1015-1021"],"references":["251160330_The_antecedents_and_consequences_of_academic_excuse-making_Examining_individual_differences_in_procrastination","240286119_Longitudinal_Study_of_Procrastination_Performance_Stress_and_Health_The_Costs_and_Benefits_of_Dawdling","223204948_Procrastination_and_personality_performance_and_mood","277681069_Attaining_Self-Regulation","263522736_Procrastination_as_self-regulation_failure_of_performance_Effects_of_cognitive_load_self-awareness_and_time_limits_on_'working_best_under_pressure'","247728109_Effects_of_Ability_High_School_Achievement_and_Procrastinatory_Behavior_on_College_Performance","247522582_Classroom_Applications_of_Research_on_Self-Regulated_Learning","240278548_The_Development_and_Concurrent_Validity_of_the_Procrastination_Scale","234582904_Using_Tests_as_an_Incentive_to_Motivate_Procrastinators_to_Study","227975323_Procrastination_as_Self-regulation_Failure_of_Performance_Effects_of_Cognitive_Load_Self-awareness_and_Time_Limits_on_'Working_Best_Under_Pressure'"]}
