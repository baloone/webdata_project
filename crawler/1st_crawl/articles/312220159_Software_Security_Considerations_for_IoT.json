{"id":"312220159_Software_Security_Considerations_for_IoT","abstract":"Internet of Things (IoT) is a swiftly growing technology and business domain that is expected to revolutionize the modern trade. Nonetheless, shortcomings in security are common in this new domain and security issues are the Achilles' heel of the new technology. In this study, we analyze different security solutions for IoT devices and propose suitable techniques for further analysis. The aim of this study is to provide guidance on implementing security solutions for both existing and coming devices of Internet of Things, by providing analysis and defining the Complexity of Implementation score for each solution.","authors":["Aki Koivu","Lauri Koivunen","Shohreh Hosseinzadeh","Samuel Laur√®n"],"meta":["December 2016","DOI:10.1109/iThings-GreenCom-CPSCom-SmartData.2016.93","Conference: 2016 IEEE International Conference on Internet of Things (iThings) and IEEE Green Computing and Communications (GreenCom) and IEEE Cyber, Physical and Social Computing (CPSCom) and IEEE Smart Data (SmartData)At: Chengdu, China","Project: CyberTrust"],"references":["300413927_Internet_of_things_IoT_security_Current_status_challenges_and_prospective_measures","285757006_Operating_Systems_for_Low-End_Devices_in_the_Internet_of_Things_A_Survey","280500892_Twenty_Security_Considerations_for_Cloud-Supported_Internet_of_Things","277307837_Secure_Scrum_Development_of_Secure_Software_with_Scrum","261075256_A_Systemic_Approach_for_IoT_Security","220477862_The_Power_of_10_Rules_for_Developing_Safety-Critical_Code","309094566_Internet_of_Things_Principles_and_Paradigms","308816141_Security_considerations_for_secure_and_trustworthy_smart_home_system_in_the_IoT_environment","308690415_Operating_Systems_for_IoT_Devices_A_Critical_Survey","306154155_How_Smart_Connected_Products_are_Transforming_Companies","305032069_A_Study_on_Device_Security_in_IoT_Convergence","302960150_Obfuscation_and_Diversification_for_Securing_the_Internet_of_Things_IoT","301610668_Security_analysis_on_consumer_and_industrial_IoT_devices","288722741_Towards_a_diversification_framework_for_operating_system_protection","287197042_Security_in_the_Internet_of_Things_through_Obfuscation_and_Diversification","286735277_Evaluation_of_static_analysis_tools_for_software_security","282937929_A_taxonomy_of_security_and_privacy_requirements_for_the_Internet_of_Things_IoT","261148615_Profile-guided_automated_software_diversity","248036760_The_TLS_Transport_Layer_Security_Protocol","221609721_On_the_effectiveness_of_address-space_randomization","221005669_Security_considerations_for_IEEE_802154_networks","2956143_Embedded_system_security"]}
