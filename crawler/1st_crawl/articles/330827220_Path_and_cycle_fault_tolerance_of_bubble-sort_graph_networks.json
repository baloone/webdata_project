{"id":"330827220_Path_and_cycle_fault_tolerance_of_bubble-sort_graph_networks","abstract":"The bubble-sort graph Bn is one of attractive underlying topologies for distributed systems. Let H be a certain connected subgraph of Bn. The H-structure connectivity of Bn, denoted κ(Bn;H), is the cardinality of a minimal set of subgraphs F={H1,H2,…,Hm} in Bn, such that every Hi∈F is isomorphic to H, and F's removal will disconnect Bn. The H-substructure connectivity of Bn, denoted κs(Bn;H), is the cardinality of a minimal set of subgraphs F={J1,J2,…,Jm}, such that every Ji∈F is isomorphic to a connected subgraph of H, and F's removal will disconnect Bn. The two kinds of connectivity are both generalizations of the classic connectivity. In this paper, we prove that κ(Bn;Pk)=κs(Bn;Pk)=⌈[Formula presented]⌉ for n≥6 and odd k≤2n−3, κ(Bn;Pk)=κs(Bn;Pk)=⌈[Formula presented]⌉ for n≥6 and even k≤2n−2, and κ(Bn;C2k)=κs(Bn;C2k)=⌈[Formula presented]⌉ for 6≤2k≤n−1.","authors":["Guozhen Zhang","Shangwei Lin"],"meta":["February 2019Theoretical Computer Science 779(4)","DOI:10.1016/j.tcs.2019.01.036"],"references":["220185761_On_the_extraconnectivity_of_graphs","3301420_Embedding_Long_Paths_in_k-Ary_n-Cubes_with_Faulty_Nodes_and_Links","3043255_Conditional_Connectivity_Measures_for_Large_Multiprocessor_Systems","325919211_Hamiltonian_cycle_and_path_embeddings_in_3-ary_n_-cubes_based_on_K_1_3_-structure_faults","321933754_Structure_connectivity_and_substructure_connectivity_of_k_-ary_n_-cube_networks","320845746_Structure_fault_tolerance_of_hypercubes_and_folded_hypercubes","308922827_Hamiltonian_Cycle_and_Path_Embeddings_in_k-Ary_n-Cubes_Based_on_Structure_Faults","301307738_Structure_connectivity_and_substructure_connectivity_of_hypercubes","287148222_23-Restricted_Connectivity_of_Locally_Twisted_Cubes","272612985_The_Conditional_Connectivity_of_nk_-Star_Graph","262361611_Fault_tolerance_in_-ary_-cube_networks","262253344_The_number_of_shortest_paths_in_the_arrangement_graph","260464513_3-extra_connectivity_of_3-ary_n-cube_networks","256744864_2323-Extraconnectivities_of_hypercube-like_networks","256721525_A_kind_of_conditional_conneCtivity_of_Cayley_graphs_generated_by_unicyclic_graphs","235246878_A_kind_of_conditional_vertex_connectivity_of_Cayley_graphs_generated_by_2-trees","223818998_Hamiltonian_laceability_of_bubble-sort_graphs_with_edge_faults","223005863_Embedding_longest_fault-free_paths_onto_star_graphs_with_more_vertex_faults","222331089_Edge-bipancyclicity_and_edge-fault-tolerant_bipancyclicity_of_bubble-sort_graphs","222300202_Optimal_fault-tolerant_embedding_of_paths_in_twisted_cubes","220571023_Panconnectivity_and_edge-pancyclicity_of_-ary_-cubes_with_faulty_elements","220329229_A_Group-Theoretic_Model_for_Symmetric_Interconnection_Networks","220318681_Extraconnectivity_of_hypercubes_II","220310873_Efficient_unicast_in_bijective_connection_networks_with_the_restricted_faulty_node_set","220246023_The_Conditional_Node_Connectivity_Of_The_k-Ary_n-Cube","220152131_An_efficient_fault-tolerant_routing_algorithm_in_bijective_connection_networks_with_restricted_faulty_edges","220148786_Conditional_matching_preclusion_for_the_arrangement_graphs","220115200_Conditional_connectivity_of_Cayley_graphs_generated_by_transposition_trees","220111479_A_study_of_fault_tolerance_in_star_graph","3299542_Uniform_approach_for_solving_some_classical_problems_on_a_linear_array","3043527_Lee_Distance_and_Topological_Properties_of_k-ary_n-cubes"]}
