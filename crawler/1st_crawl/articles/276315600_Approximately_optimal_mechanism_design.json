{"id":"276315600_Approximately_optimal_mechanism_design","abstract":"This survey describes the approximately optimal mechanism design paradigm and uses it to investigate two basic questions in auction theory. First, when is complexity --- in the sense of detailed distributional knowledge --- an essential feature of revenue-maximizing single-item auctions? Second, do combinatorial auctions require high-dimensional bid spaces to achieve good social welfare?","authors":["Tim Roughgarden"],"meta":["January 2015ACM SIGecom Exchanges 13(2):4-20","DOI:10.1145/2728732.2728733"],"references":["309077756_Job_matching_coalition_formation_and_gross_substitutes","271855544_The_Sample_Complexity_of_Revenue_Maximization","263811661_Making_the_Most_of_Your_Samples","247926036_The_Lovely_but_Lonely_Vickrey_Auction","232906093_Composable_and_Efficient_Mechanisms","230899422_Simultaneous_Auctions_are_almost_Efficient","228730784_Approximation_in_Mechanism_Design","227389481_Putting_Auction_Theory_To_Work","221660779_On_the_efficiency_of_equilibria_in_generalized_second_price_auctions","221444957_On_the_efficiency_of_equilibria_in_generalized_second_price_auctions","220553622_Simple_versus_optimal_mechanisms","50425564_Non-Price_Equilibria_in_Markets_of_Discrete_Goods","45870841_Price_of_Anarchy_for_Greedy_Auctions","4909289_Market_Research_and_Market_Design","4901330_Auctions_Versus_Negotiations","4813174_Incentives_in_Teams","1955771_Truth_Revelation_in_Approximately_Efficient_Combinatorial_Auctions","313100149_Optimal_auction_design","312538489_Revenue_maximization_with_a_single_sample","286007129_Barriers_to_Near-Optimal_Equilibria","281759429_Algorithmic_Mechanism_Design_Through_the_lens_of_Multiunit_auctions","273698329_Counter_Speculation_Auctions_and_Competitive_Sealed_Tenders","269033465_Reserve_prices_in_internet_advertising_auctions_A_field_experiment","260268632_Sampling_and_Representation_Complexity_of_Revenue_Maximization","247812919_The_Communication_Requirements_of_Combinatorial_Allocation_Problems","236221580_Multipart_Pricing_of_Public_Goods","234793335_A_theory_of_the_learnable","222700623_The_effectiveness_of_English_auctions","222570178_Competitive_Auctions","222485944_Walrasian_Equilibrium_with_Gross_Substitutes","222420378_Combinatorial_Auctions_with_Decreasing_Marginal_Utilities","222416128_The_communication_requirement_of_efficient_allocations_and_supporting_prices_Journal_of_Economic_Theory_1291_192-224","221445047_Revenue_maximization_with_a_single_sample","210303573_Counterspeculation_Auctions_and_Competitive_Sealed_Tenders","46479636_Reserve_Prices_in_Internet_Advertising_Auctions_A_Field_Experiment","30875797_A_Theory_of_the_Learnable","5202190_Optimal_Auction_Design","4981021_Optimal_Pricing_Mechanisms_with_Unknown_Demand","4952247_Auctions_of_Heterogeneous_Objects","4815653_Efficiency_of_Large_Private_Value_Auctions","2373993_Algorithmic_Mechanism_Design","2351491_Truth_Revelation_in_Approximately_Ecient_Combinatorial_Auctions","1747535_Algorithmic_Pricing_via_Virtual_Valuations"]}
