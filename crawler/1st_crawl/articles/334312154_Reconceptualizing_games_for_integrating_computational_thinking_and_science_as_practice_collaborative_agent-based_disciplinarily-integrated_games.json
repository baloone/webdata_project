{"id":"334312154_Reconceptualizing_games_for_integrating_computational_thinking_and_science_as_practice_collaborative_agent-based_disciplinarily-integrated_games","abstract":"This paper situates a critical review of studies that we have conducted within the broader research literature to analyze the affordances of integrating modeling within disciplinarily-integrated games from computational thinking and science as practice perspectives. Across the studies, the analyses pursue two themes: (a) the role of agent-based modeling as a synergistic local practice around which we can integrate computational thinking and scientific modeling within digital games and (b) the role of collaboration in leveraging those synergies. We then present a design of a disciplinarily-integrated game that integrates these themes to demonstrate one such possible instantiation of the themes. Finally, we discuss the implications for design and praxis with a particular focus on learning in classrooms across the curriculum. Specifically, we first explore the implications in terms of connecting to teachersâ€™ views of practice by framing computational modeling and computational thinking as mathematization. We then explore the implications of shifting from a focus on single players to communities of practice in terms of computational participation as science as practice. We close by exploring the pragmatic and pedagogical affordances of shifting from stand-alone single-topic games to flexible agent-based environments in terms of student development across the curriculum.","authors":["Douglas Burton Clark","Pratim Sengupta"],"meta":["July 2019Interactive Learning Environments 28(2):1-19","DOI:10.1080/10494820.2019.1636071"],"references":["332741170_Modeling_Games_in_the_K-12_Science_Classroom","323180092_Multiplayer_Disciplinarily-Integrated_Agent-Based_Games_SURGE_Gameblox","323175622_Digital_Games_in_the_Science_Classroom_Leveraging_Internal_and_External_Scaffolds_during_Game_Play","321038782_Reframing_Coding_as_Mathematization_in_the_K12_Classroom_Views_from_Teacher_Professional_Learning","313048588_Symbolic_communication_in_mathematics_and_science_Co-constructing_inscription_and_thought","301666783_Development_of_Mechanistic_Reasoning_and_Multilevel_Explanations_of_Ecology_in_Third_Grade_Using_Agent-Based_Models_MECHANISTIC_REASONING_and_AGENT-BASED_MODELS","329650695_Creating_Scientific_Concepts","325752698_Designing_Educational_Video_Games_to_Be_Objects-to-Think-With","324373353_Mindstorms_Children_Computers_and_Powerful_Ideas","317953373_Social_linguistics_and_literacies_Ideology_in_discourses"]}
