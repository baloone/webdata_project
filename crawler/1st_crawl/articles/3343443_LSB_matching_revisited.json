{"id":"3343443_LSB_matching_revisited","abstract":"This letter proposes a modification to the least-significant-bit (LSB) matching, a steganographic method for embedding message bits into a still image. In the LSB matching, the choice of whether to add or subtract one from the cover image pixel is random. The new method uses the choice to set a binary function of two cover pixels to the desired value. The embedding is performed using a pair of pixels as a unit, where the LSB of the first pixel carries one bit of information, and a function of the two pixel values carries another bit of information. Therefore, the modified method allows embedding the same payload as LSB matching but with fewer changes to the cover image. The experimental results of the proposed method show better performance than traditional LSB matching in terms of distortion and resistance against existing steganalysis.","authors":["Jarno Mielikainen"],"meta":["June 2006Signal Processing Letters, IEEE 13(5):285 - 287","DOI:10.1109/LSP.2006.870357","SourceIEEE Xplore"],"references":["221011241_Maximum_likelihood_estimation_of_length_of_secret_message_embedded_using_-_K_steganography_in_spatial_domain","221011204_Stochastic_approach_to_secret_message_length_estimation_in_-_k_embedding_steganography","220722225_An_Implementation_of_Key-Based_Digital_Signal_Steganography","313694441_Improved_detection_of_LSB_steganography_in_grayscale_images","225255362_Improved_Detection_of_LSB_Steganography_in_Grayscale_Images","221435582_Improved_RS_Method_for_Detection_of_LSB_Steganography","221146740_SIMPLIcity_Semantics-sensitive_Integrated_Matching_for_Picture_Libraries","221011280_On_steganalysis_of_plus-minus_one_embedding_of_continuous_tone_images","220722114_An_Improved_Sample_Pairs_Method_for_Detection_of_LSB_Embedding","220722113_A_General_Framework_for_Structural_Steganalysis_of_LSB_Replacement"]}
