{"id":"263890323_OpenML_Networked_science_in_machine_learning","abstract":"Many sciences have made significant breakthroughs by adopting online tools\nthat help organize, structure and mine information that is too detailed to be\nprinted in journals. In this paper, we introduce OpenML, a place for machine\nlearning researchers to share and organize data in fine detail, so that they\ncan work more effectively, be more visible, and collaborate with others to\ntackle harder problems. We discuss how OpenML relates to other examples of\nnetworked science and what benefits it brings for machine learning research,\nindividual scientists, as well as students and practitioners.","authors":["Joaquin Vanschoren","Jan N van Rijn","Bernd Bischl","Lu√≠s Torgo"],"meta":["December 2013ACM SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter 15(2):49-60","DOI:10.1145/2641190.2641198"],"references":["309321208_mlr_Machine_Learning_in_R","260311444_A_RapidMiner_extension_for_Open_Machine_Learning","260311386_Selecting_Classification_Algorithms_with_Active_Testing","257618363_Experiment_databases","257364389_OpenML_A_Collaborative_Science_Platform","239604732_Comparing_Learning_Approaches_to_Coreference_Resolution_There_is_More_to_it_Than_'Bias'","232975832_The_Altmetrics_Collection","310751965_TunedITorg_System_for_automated_evaluation_of_algorithms_in_repeatable_experiments","271503413_Reinventing_Discovery_-_The_New_Era_of_Networked_Science","270051795_A_second_generation_human_haplotype_map_of_over_31_million_SNPs"]}
