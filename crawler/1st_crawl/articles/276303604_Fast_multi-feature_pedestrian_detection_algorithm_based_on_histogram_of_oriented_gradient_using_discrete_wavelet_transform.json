This kind of interfacing system technology becomes more popular in driver assistance system of automobile. Especially, pedestrian detection is an important cue for intelligent vehicles and interactive driver assistance system. In this paper, we propose a pedestrian detection feature and technique by combining histogram of the oriented gradient (HOG) and discrete wavelet transform (DWT). In the method, the magnitude of motion is used to set region of interest (ROI) for improving detection speed. Then, we employ multi-feature for a pedestrian detection based on the HOG and DWT. In last stage, to classify whether a candidate window contains a pedestrian or not, the designed multi-feature is learned by using the training data with the support vector machine (SVM) mechanism. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm increases the speed-up factor of 27.21 % by comparing to the existing method using the original HOG feature.","authors":["Gwang-Soo Hong","Byung-Gyu Kim","Youngsup Hwang","Kee-Koo Kwon"],"meta":["January 2015Multimedia Tools and Applications 75(23)","DOI:10.1007/s11042-015-2455-2"],"references":["319770205_Monocular_pedestrian_detection_survey_and_experiments","264151703_Region-Based_Facial_Expression_Recognition_in_Still_Images","264148970_Interactive_Semantic_Image_Retrieval","264099105_Wavelet-based_Feature_Extraction_Algorithm_for_an_Iris_Recognition_System","235626451_Real-time_pedestrian_detection_based_on_edge_factor_and_Histogram_of_Oriented_Gradient","227191648_A_Trainable_System_for_Object_Detection","224342940_Gavrila_DM_Monocular_pedestrian_detection_Survey_and_experiments_IEEE_Trans_on_PAMI_3112_2179-2195","224164350_New_Features_and_Insights_for_Pedestrian_Detection","224135946_An_HOG-LBP_human_detector_with_partial_occlusion_handling","221304792_Human_Detection_Based_on_a_Probabilistic_Assembly_of_Robust_Part_Detectors","220744992_Multiview_Pedestrian_Detection_Based_on_Vector_Boosting","44617776_Survey_of_Pedestrian_Detection_for_Advanced_Driver_Assistance_Systems","3192100_Mallat_SG_A_Theory_of_Multiresolution_Signal_Decomposition_The_Wavelet_Representation_IEEE_Trans_Pattern_Anal_Machine_Intell_11_674-693","319770820_Histograms_of_Oriented_Gradients_for_Human_Detection","314408091_Pedestrian_Detection_A_Benchmark","232632415_Pedestrian_detection_A_benchmark","224094934_Real_Time_ROI_Generation_for_Pedestrian_Detection","221411468_A_Method_for_Visualizing_Pedestrian_Traffic_Flow_Using_SIFT_Feature_Point_Tracking","221363401_Detecting_Pedestrians_by_Learning_Shapelet_Features","221304550_Human_Detection_Using_Oriented_Histograms_of_Flow_and_Appearance","200038910_Distinctive_Image_Features_from_Scale-Invariant_Keypoints","51539292_Pedestrian_Detection_An_Evaluation_of_the_State_of_the_Art","3453939_Human-centered_intelligent_vehicles_Toward_multimodal_interface_integration","3428053_Pedestrian_Protection_Systems_Issues_Survey_and_Challenges","2931099_Statistical_Models_of_Appearance_for_computer_vision"]}
