{"id":"265430435_A_WORKBENCH_FOR_DOCUMENT_PROCESSING","abstract":"During the MEMORIAL project time an international consortium has developed a software solution called DDW (Digital Document Workbench). It provides a set of tools to support the process of digitisation of documents from the scanning up to the retrievable presentation of the content. The attention is focused to machine typed archival documents. One of the important features is the evaluation of quality in each step of the process. The workbench consists of automatic parts as well as of parts which request human activity. The measurable improvement of 20% shows the approach is successful.","authors":["Karola Witschurke"],"meta":[],"references":["39994794_A_Complete_Approach_to_the_Conversion_of_Typewritten_Historical_Documents_for_Digital_Archives","28579193_The_lifecycle_of_a_digital_historical_document_structure_and_content","228690960_Memorial_Project-A_complex_approach_to_digitisation_of_personal_records","220932911_Preprocessing_and_Segmentation_of_Bad_Quality_Machine_Typed_Documents","220833311_Digital_document_life_cycle_development"]}
