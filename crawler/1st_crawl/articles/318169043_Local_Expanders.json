{"id":"318169043_Local_Expanders","abstract":"A map \\({f : \\{0,1\\}^{n} \\to \\{0,1\\}^{n}}\\) has localityt if every output bit of f depends only on t input bits. Arora et al. (Colloquium on automata, languages and programming, ICALP, 2009) asked if there exist bounded-degree expander graphs on 2ⁿ nodes such that the neighbors of a node \\({x\\in\\{0,1\\}^{n}}\\) can be computed by maps of constant locality. We give an explicit construction of such graphs with locality one. We then give three applications of this construction: (1) lossless expanders with constant locality, (2) more efficient error reduction for randomized algorithms, and (3) more efficient hardness amplification of one-way permutations. We also give, for n of the form \\({n=4\\cdot3^{t}}\\), an explicit construction of bipartite Ramanujan graphs of degree 3 with 2ⁿ−1 nodes in each side such that the neighbors of a node \\({x\\in \\{0,1\\}^{n}{\\setminus} \\{0^{n}\\}}\\) can be computed either (1) in constant locality or (2) in constant time using standard operations on words of length \\({\\Omega(n)}\\). Our results use in black-box fashion deep explicit constructions of Cayley expander graphs, by Kassabov (Invent Math 170(2):327–354, 2007) for the symmetric group \\({S_{n}}\\) and by Morgenstern (J Comb Theory Ser B 62(1):44–62, 1994) for the special linear group SL\\({(2,F_{2^{n}})}\\).","authors":["Emanuele Viola","Avi Wigderson"],"meta":["June 2018computational complexity 27(4)","DOI:10.1007/s00037-017-0155-1"],"references":["308845802_Interlacing_Families_IV_Bipartite_Ramanujan_Graphs_of_All_Sizes","267967012_Short_PCPs_with_Projection_Queries","266001886_Foundations_of_Cryptography_Basic_Tools","265458700_Introduction_to_Coding_Theory","265427016_Expander_graphs_and_their_application","240001167_Foundations_of_Cryptography_Volume_1Basic_Tools","238676901_Explicit_Construction_of_Concentrators","235008641_Theory_and_Applications_of_Trapdoor_Functions","234794684_Expanders_obtained_from_affine_transformations","228668090_Pseudorandomness","221580801_Nonuniform_ACC_Circuit_Lower_Bounds","221498749_Semi-Direct_Product_in_Groups_and_Zig-Zag_Product_in_Graphs_Connections_and_Applications","227760853_On_e-biased_generators_in_NC0","222780527_Existence_and_Explicit_Constructions_of_q_1_Regular_Ramanujan_Graphs_for_Every_Prime_Power_q","221498922_Explicit_Unique-Neighbor_Expanders"]}
