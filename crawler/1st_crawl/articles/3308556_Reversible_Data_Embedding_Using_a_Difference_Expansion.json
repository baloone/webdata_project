{"id":"3308556_Reversible_Data_Embedding_Using_a_Difference_Expansion","abstract":"Reversible data embedding has drawn lots of interest recently. Being reversible, the original digital content can be completely restored. We present a novel reversible data-embedding method for digital images. We explore the redundancy in digital images to achieve very high embedding capacity, and keep the distortion low.","authors":["Jun Tian"],"meta":["September 2003IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology 13(8):890 - 896","DOI:10.1109/TCSVT.2003.815962","SourceIEEE Xplore"],"references":["228809844_Reversible_watermarking_by_difference_expansion","228712169_Lossless_multiresolution_transform_for_image_authenticating_watermarking","27355088_Lossless_Data_EmbeddingAAANew_Paradigm_in_Digital_Watermarking","3970329_Reversible_data_hiding","3424127_Circular_interpretation_of_bijective_transformations_in_lossless_watermarking_for_media_asset_management","307762026_Lossless_Data_EmbeddingAAANew_Paradigm_in_Digital_Watermarking","243776826_Lossless_recovery_of_an_original_image_containing_embedded_data","238570130_Wavelet-based_reversible_watermarking_for_authentication","221128789_Reversible_data_hiding","3963998_Capacity_bounds_and_constructions_for_reversible_data-hiding"]}
