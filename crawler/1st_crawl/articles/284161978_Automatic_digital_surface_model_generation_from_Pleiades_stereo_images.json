{"id":"284161978_Automatic_digital_surface_model_generation_from_Pleiades_stereo_images","abstract":"We propose a fully automated stereo pipeline for producing digital elevation models from Pléiades satellite images. The agility of the Pléiades satellites allows them to capture multiple views of the same target in a single pass, enabling new applications that exploit these quasi-simultaneous high-resolution images. Concretely the tri-stereo acquisition modality allows to reduce the occlusions and to cross-validate the observed points. This paper gives an overview of the pipeline, named s2p, and presents some digital elevation models and 3D point clouds built from Pléiades tri-stereo datasets. The data was provided by Airbus DS and the CNES through the RTU program (Recette Thématique Utilisateurs Pléiades). The particularity of the s2p algorithm is that it allows to use conventional stereo correlation tools, by performing a very precise image rectification of each stereo pair. Although the acquisition system does not fit the projective camera model, the errors due to the projective assumption were shown to be negligible for small enough image sizes. Thus, the whole image can be treated by cutting it into small tiles that are processed independently.","authors":["Carlo de Franchis","Enric Meinhardt-Llopis","Julien Michel","Jean-Michel Morel"],"meta":["October 2014Revue Francaise de Photogrammetrie et de Teledetection 208(208):137-142","DOI:10.52638/rfpt.2014.136","Project: Earth Observation and Stereo Vision"],"references":["282359193_Automatic_sensor_orientation_refinement_of_Pleiades_stereo_images","282179655_On_stereo-rectification_of_pushbroom_images","281690380_Numerical_simulation_of_landscape_evolution_and_water_run-off_on_digital_elevation_models_obtained_from_Pleiades","259896471_DSM_Based_Orientation_of_Large_Stereo_Satellite_Image_Blocks","259896051_Fully_automated_generation_of_accurate_digital_surface_models_with_sub-meter_resolution_from_satellite_imagery","259850205_Dense_Multi-View_Stereo_from_Satellite_Imagery","228902962_A_Comprehensive_study_of_the_rational_function_model_for_photogrammetric_processing","228856112_An_evaluation_of_rational_function_for_photogrammetric_restitution","316240097_Distinctive_Image_Features_from_Scale-Invariant_Keypoints","273663214_A_Piecewise_Approach_to_Epipolar_Resampling_of_Pushbroom_Satellite_Images_Based_on_RPC"]}
