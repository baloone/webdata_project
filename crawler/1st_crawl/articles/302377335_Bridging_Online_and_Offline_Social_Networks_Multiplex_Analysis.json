{"id":"302377335_Bridging_Online_and_Offline_Social_Networks_Multiplex_Analysis","abstract":"We show that three basic actor characteristics, namely normalized reciprocity, three cycles, and triplets, can be expressed using an unified framework that is based on computing the similarity index between two sets associated with the actor: the set of her/his friends and the set of those considering her/him as a friend. These metrics are extended to multiplex networks and then computed for two friendship networks generated by collecting data from two groups of undergraduate students. We found that in offline communication strong and weak ties are (almost) equally presented, while in online communication weak ties are dominant. Moreover, weak ties are much less reciprocal than strong ties. However, across different layers of the multiplex network reciprocities are preserved, while triads (measured with normalized three cycles and triplets) are not significant.","authors":["Sonja Filiposka","Andrej Gajduk","Tamara Dimitrova","Ljupco Kocarev"],"meta":["May 2016Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications 471","DOI:10.1016/j.physa.2016.12.050"],"references":["282815017_Structure_of_triadic_relations_in_multiplex_networks","279954374_The_Social_and_Economic_Bases_of_Network_Multiplexity_Exploring_the_Emergence_of_Multiplex_Ties","262071553_MuxViz_A_Tool_for_Multilayer_Analysis_and_Visualization_of_Networks","261732150_Structural_measures_for_multiplex_networks","257347892_Eigenvector_centrality_of_nodes_in_multiplex_networks","255972432_Growing_Multiplex_Networks","242718619_Party_Coalitions_and_Interest_Group_Networks","237259946_Social_Structure_from_Multiple_Networks_I_Blockmodels_of_Roles_and_Positions","230784845_Evolution_of_Cooperation_in_Multiplex_Networks","229077990_Analysis_of_Neighbourhoods_in_Multi-layered_Dynamic_Social_Networks","228139322_The_Missing_Link_The_Effect_of_Customers_on_the_Formation_of_Relationships_Among_Producers_in_the_Multiplex_Triads","228067277_The_Human_Socio-Cognitive_Niche_and_Its_Evolutionary_Origins","220520969_Structural_Logic_of_Intraorganizational_Networks","45275132_Multirelational_Organization_of_Large-Scale_Social_Networks_in_an_Online_World","44596376_Community_Structure_in_Time-Dependent_Multiscale_and_Multiplex_Networks","38175499_Measuring_tie-strength_in_virtual_social_networks","7888174_The_architecture_of_complex_weighted_networks","313607570_The_architecture_of_complex_weighted_networks","271685817_Multiple_Networks_and_Mobilization_in_the_Paris_Commune_1871","263221951_Multiplexity_Growth_Mechanisms_and_Structural_Variety_in_Scientific_Collaboration_Networks","255972433_Coevolution_and_Correlated_Multiplexity_in_Multiplex_Networks","249942361_The_Integrative_Power_of_Civic_Networks1","249172719_Social_Structure_from_Multiple_Networks_II_Role_Structures","248390464_The_Strength_of_Weak_Ties","243775745_Robust_Action_and_the_Rise_of_the_Medici","238635147_Robust_Action_and_the_Rise_of_the_Medici_1400-1434","215915778_Economic_Action_and_Social_Structure_The_Problem_of_Embeddedness","51992872_Economic_Action_and_Social_Structure_The_Problem_of_Embeddedness","51992864_The_Strength_of_Weak_Ties","30531238_The_Integrative_Power_of_Civic_Networks","13660517_Collective_Dynamics_of_Small_World_Networks"]}
