{"id":"325735823_Impact_of_dwell_time_distribution_on_location_management_in_cellular_networks","abstract":"This paper presents dwell time distribution based optimal reporting cell planning (RCP) for location management in wireless cellular networks. Dwell time parameter is critically dependent on usersâ€™ behavior within the network. The innate advantage of Percentile dwell time over the conventionally used absolute dwell time is that it can take only fixed values depending on the number of cells per location area. This helps tremendously in reducing the computational overhead and can be applied to any size of the network as long as the number of cells per location area remains constant. Consequently, the proposed percentile dwell time has been used to determine the optimal reporting cell-planning configuration such that the overall mobility management cost is minimized. Evidently, from the simulation result the proposed technique provides a clear edge of 14.28% improvement in cost reduction compared to the existing technique.","authors":["Prateek","S.
