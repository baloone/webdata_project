{"id":"242529835_The_Associahedron_and_Triangulations_of_the_n-gon","abstract":"Let P n be a convex n -gon in the plane, n ⩾ 3. Consider Σ n , the collection of all sets of mutually non-crossing diagonals of P n . Then Σ n is a simplicial complex of dimension n − 4. We prove that Σ n is isomorphic to the boundary complex of some ( n − 3)-dimensional simplicial convex polytope, and that this polytope can be geometrically realized to have the dihedral group D n as its group of symmetries. Formulas for the f -vector and h -vector of this polytope and some implications for related combinatorial problems are discussed.","authors":["Carl W.
