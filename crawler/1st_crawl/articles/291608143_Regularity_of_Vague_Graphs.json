{"id":"291608143_Regularity_of_Vague_Graphs","abstract":"A vague graph is a generalized structure of a fuzzy graph that\ngives more precision, flexibility and compatibility to a system when compared\nwith systems that are designed using fuzzy graphs. In this paper, some properties of an edge regular vague graph are given. Particularly, strongly regular, edge regular and bi-regular vague graphs are defined and the necessary and sufficient condition for a vague graph to be strongly regular is studied. Likewise, we have introduced a partially edge regular vague graph and fully edge regular vague graph with suitable illustrations. Finally, we gave an application of vague digraph in travel time.","authors":["Hossein Rashmanlou","Rajabali Borzooei","Sovan Samanta","Madhumangal Pal"],"meta":["April 2016Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems 30(6)","DOI:10.3233/IFS-162114","Project: Fuzzy Social Networks"],"references":["322593939_EDGE_REGULAR_INTUITIONISTIC_FUZZY_GRAPH","281399313_Degree_of_vertices_in_vague_graphs","281336888_Domination_in_vague_graphs_and_its_applications","280067384_Ring_sum_in_product_intuitionistic_fuzzy_graphs","280067009_Complete_interval-valued_fuzzy_graphs","280066105_Balanced_Interval-Valued_Fuzzy_Graphs","278965084_Bipolar_Fuzzy_Graphs_with_Categorical_Properties","276849270_m-Step_fuzzy_competition_graphs","275605693_New_concepts_of_fuzzy_planar_graph","273176661_Fuzzy_Planar_Graphs","259692489_Vague_hypergraphs","259578276_Antipodal_Interval-Valued_Fuzzy_Graphs","236943557_Fuzzy_Threshold_Graphs","236943359_Fuzzy_k_-Competition_Graphs_and_p_-Competition_Fuzzy_Graphs","235318732_Fuzzy_Tolerance_Graphs","292143739_Product_of_bipolar_fuzzy_graphs_and_their_degree","280066450_Some_Properties_of_Highly_Irregular_Interval_Valued_Fuzzy_Graphs","276849299_A_study_on_bipolar_fuzzy_graphs","265201014_Vague_Graphs","247520571_Similarity_and_fuzzy_ordering","235943829_Vague_Sets","222439366_Fuzzy_Sets","222180998_Is_there_a_need_for_fuzzy_logic_Inf_Sci"]}
