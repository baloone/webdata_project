{"id":"320895126_An_Overview_of_Recent_Advances_in_Event-Triggered_Consensus_of_Multiagent_Systems","abstract":"Event-triggered consensus of multi-agent systems has attracted tremendous attention from both theoretical and practical perspectives due to the fact that it enables all agents eventually to reach an agreement upon a common quantity of interest while significantly alleviating utilization of communication and computation resources. This paper aims to provide an overview of recent advances in event-triggered consensus of multi-agent systems. First, a basic framework of multi-agent event-triggered operational mechanisms is established.\nSecond, representative results and methodologies reported in the literature are reviewed and some in-depth analysis is made on several event-triggered schemes, including event-based sampling schemes, model-based event-triggered schemes, sampled-data-based event-triggered schemes and self-triggered sampling schemes. Third, two examples are outlined to show applicability of event-triggered consensus in power sharing of microgrids and formation control of multi-robot systems, respectively. Finally, some challenging issues on event-triggered consensus are proposed for future research.","authors":["Lei Ding","Qing-Long Han","Xiaohua Ge","Xian-Ming Zhang"],"meta":["April 2018IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics 48(04):1110-1123","DOI:10.1109/TCYB.2017.2771560","Project: Event-triggered systems"],"references":["320895237_A_Dynamic_Event-Triggered_Transmission_Scheme_for_Distributed_Set-Membership_Estimation_Over_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","320393614_A_survey_on_security_control_and_attack_detection_for_industrial_cyber-physical_systems","320393085_A_survey_on_recent_advances_in_distributed_sampled-data_cooperative_control_of_multi-agent_systems","319699609_Achieving_Cluster_Formation_of_Multi-Agent_Systems_Under_Aperiodic_Sampling_and_Communication_Delays","316751178_Distributed_formation_control_of_networked_multi-agent_systems_using_a_dynamic_event-triggered_communication_mechanism","316079937_Event-Triggered_Control_of_Multi-Agent_Systems_for_Fixed_and_Time-Varying_Network_Topologies","314950095_Constrained_Consensus_Algorithms_With_Fixed_Step_Size_for_Distributed_Convex_Optimization_Over_Multiagent_Networks","313834704_A_Multi-Agent_System_Based_Event-Triggered_Hybrid_Control_Scheme_for_Energy_Internet","313825533_Synchronization_of_Multi-Agent_Systems_Using_Event-Triggered_and_Self-Triggered_Broadcasts","313254571_A_Collaborative_Neurodynamic_Approach_to_Multiple-Objective_Distributed_Optimization"]}
