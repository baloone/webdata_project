{"id":"277023370_SAF_Stochastic_Adaptive_Forwarding_in_Named_Data_Networking","abstract":"Forwarding decisions in classical IP-based networks are determined by\nrouting. This is necessary to avoid loops, aggravating opportunities to\nimplement an adaptive and intelligent forwarding plane. Therefore content\ndistribution efficiency is reduced due to a lack of inherent multi-path\ntransmission. In Named Data Networking (NDN) instead, routing shall hold a\nsupporting role to forwarding, providing sufficient potential to enhance\ncontent dissemination at the forwarding plane. In this paper we design,\nimplement, and evaluate a novel probability-based forwarding strategy, called\nStochastic Adaptive Forwarding (SAF) for NDN. By extensive simulations we show\nthat our approach outperforms existing forwarding strategies in terms of the\nrequest satisfaction ratio. This is achieved by extensive utilization of NDN's\nmultipath and content-lookup capabilities without relying on the routing plane.\nSAF explores the local environment by redirecting requests that are likely to\nbe dropped. This allows to identify new paths to the content origin or cached\nreplicas to circumvent link failures and resource shortages.","authors":["Daniel Posch","Benjamin Rainer","Hermann Hellwagner"],"meta":["May 2015IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","DOI:10.1109/TNET.2016.2614710","SourcearXiv","Project: CONCERT"],"references":["325670481_NFD_Developer's_Guide","281652451_ndnSIM_20_A_new_version_of_the_NDN_simulator_for_NS-3","345156403_Redundancy_in_network_traffic_findings_and_implications","313171261_Approximate_models_for_general_cache_networks","303261489_A_survey_of_information-centric_networking_research","303169257_CcnSim_A_highly_scalable_CCN_simulator","290653252_On_the_role_of_routing_in_named_data_networking","280852868_Coupling_caching_and_forwarding_Benefits_analysis_and_implementation","277679415_Named_Data_Networking","271454413_Optimal_multipath_congestion_control_and_request_forwarding_in_Information-Centric_Networks","265359778_ndnSIM_ndn_simulator_for_NS-3","258082504_VIP_A_Framework_for_Joint_Dynamic_Forwarding_and_Caching_in_Named_Data_Networks","269300771_An_On-demand_Multi-Path_Interest_Forwarding_strategy_for_content_retrievals_in_CCN","262332763_INFORM_a_Dynamic_Interest_Forwarding_Mechanism_for_Information_Centric_Networking","261399057_Probability-based_adaptive_forwarding_strategy_in_named_data_networking"]}
