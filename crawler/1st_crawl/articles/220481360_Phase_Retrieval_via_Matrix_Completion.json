{"id":"220481360_Phase_Retrieval_via_Matrix_Completion","abstract":"This paper develops a novel framework for phase retrieval, a problem which\narises in X-ray crystallography, diffraction imaging, astronomical imaging and\nmany other applications. Our approach combines multiple structured\nilluminations together with ideas from convex programming to recover the phase\nfrom intensity measurements, typically from the modulus of the diffracted wave.\nWe demonstrate empirically that any complex-valued object can be recovered from\nthe knowledge of the magnitude of just a few diffracted patterns by solving a\nsimple convex optimization problem inspired by the recent literature on matrix\ncompletion. More importantly, we also demonstrate that our noise-aware\nalgorithms are stable in the sense that the reconstruction degrades gracefully\nas the signal-to-noise ratio decreases. Finally, we introduce some theory\nshowing that one can design very simple structured illumination patterns such\nthat three diffracted figures uniquely determine the phase of the object we\nwish to recover.","authors":["Emmanuel J.
