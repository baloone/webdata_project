{"id":"333526385_Use_of_Evidence-Centered_Design_to_Develop_Learning_Maps-Based_Assessments","abstract":"Evidence-based approaches to assessment design, development, and administration provide a strong foundation for an assessmentâ€™s validity argument but can be time consuming, resource intensive, and complex to implement. This article describes an evidence-based approach used for one assessment that addresses these challenges. Evidence-centered design principles were applied to create a task template to support test development for a new, instructionally embedded, large-scale alternate assessment system used for accountability purposes in 18 US states. Example evidence from the validity argument is presented to evaluate the effectiveness of the template as an evidence-based method for test development. Lessons learned, including strengths and challenges, are shared to inform test-development efforts for other programs.","authors":["Sue Bechard","Amy Clark","Russell Swinburne Romine","Meagan Karvonen"],"meta":["April 2019International Journal of Testing 19(2):188-205","DOI:10.1080/15305058.2018.1543310"],"references":["348393459_Evidence-Centered_Design","317748380_The_Philosophical_Underpinnings_and_Key_Features_of_the_Dynamic_Learning_Maps_Alternate_Assessment","267378468_Evidence-Centered_Assessment_Design_Layers_Structures_and_Terminology","272664361_Evidence-Centered_Design_for_Simulation-Based_Assessment","263034746_A_conditional_sense_of_fairness_in_assessment","237589246_Models_of_Cognition_for_Students_With_Significant_Cognitive_Disabilities_Implications_for_Assessment","234717077_A_Brief_History_of_Alternate_Assessments_Based_on_Alternate_Achievement_Standards_Synthesis_Report_68","234591969_A_Brief_Introduction_to_Evidence-Centered_Design_CSE_Report_632","232991698_The_Promises_and_Challenges_of_Implementing_Evidence-Centered_Design_in_Large-Scale_Assessment"]}
