{"id":"298796193_The_ITU-T's_new_Gfast_standard_brings_DSL_into_the_gigabit_era","abstract":"This article explores the recently issued ITU-T Recommendations specifying \"G.fast\" (G.9701 [1] and G.9700 [2]) that bring user bit rates up to 1 Gb/s over twisted pairs from the distribution point to customer premises. The overview and some key research challenges of G.fast are discussed in [3]. The standardized G.fast transmission method and advanced crosstalk cancellation techniques are presented here with specific performance projections and measurement results achieved during the first demonstrations and trials, showing bit rates of 500 Mb/s over 250 m and available reach up to 400 m. A description of standardized tools for dynamic performance maintenance, resource allocation, and power saving enhancing G.fast applications concludes this article.","authors":["Vladimir Oksman","Rainer Strobel","Xiang Wang","Dong Wei"],"meta":["March 2016IEEE Communications Magazine 54(3):118-126","DOI:10.1109/MCOM.2016.7432157"],"references":["304415185_Zero-Forcing_and_MMSE_Precoding_for_Gfast","289526879_Zero-Forcing_and_MMSE_Precoding_for_Gfast","281061942_Coexistence_of_Gfast_and_VDSL_in_FTTdp_and_FTTC_Deployments","224180554_The_ITU-T's_new_gvector_standard_proliferates_100_mbs_DSL","283806780_The_impact_of_PLC-to-DSL_interference_on_VDSL2_Vectored_VDSL2_and_Gfast","283806511_Statistical_modeling_of_PLC-to-DSL_interference","260670550_Gfast_Evolving_the_Copper_Access_Network"]}
