{"id":"269884019_The_Voice_Handicap_Index","abstract":"To date, no instruments exist to quantify the psychosocial consequences of voice disorders. The aim of the present investigation was the development of a statistically robust Voice Handicap Index (VHI). An 85-item version of this instrument was administered to 65 consecutive patients seen in the Voice Clinic at Henry Ford Hospital. The data were subjected to measures of internal consistency reliability and the initial 85-item version was reduced to a 30-item final version. This final version was administered to 63 consecutive patients on two occasions in an attempt to assess test-retest stability, which proved to be strong. The findings of the latter analysis demonstrated that a change between two administrations of 18 points represents a significant shift in psychoso-cial function.","authors":["Barbara Jacobson","Alex F Johnson","Cynthia Grywalski","Alice Silbergleit"],"meta":["August 1997American Journal of Speech-Language Pathology 6(3):66","DOI:10.1044/1058-0360.0603.66"],"references":["14570768_Development_of_the_Tinnitus_Handicap_Index","279410806_The_Hearing_Handicap_Inventory_for_Adults","269544086_The_Accent_Method_of_Voice_Therapy","21373033_Test-Retest_Reliability_of_the_Hearing_Handicap_Inventory_for_Adults","21082006_The_Hearing_Handicap_Inventory_for_Adults_psychometric_adequacy_and_audiometric_correlates","21005934_The_status_and_use_of_the_International_Classification_of_Impairments_Disabilities_and_Handicaps_ICIDH","20839410_The_Development_of_the_Dizziness_Handicap_Inventory","17100971_Linear_analogue_self-assessment_of_voice_quality_in_laryngeal_cancer","16104373_The_Hearing_Handicap_Inventory_for_the_Elderly"]}
