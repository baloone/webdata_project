{"id":"274730533_Reactive_Synthesis_Without_Regret","abstract":"Two-player, zero-sum games of infinite duration and their quantitative\nversions are often used in verification to model the interaction between a\ncontroller (Eve) and an antagonistic environment (Adam). The question usually\naddressed is that of the existence (and computability) of a strategy for Eve\nthat can maximize her payoff against any strategy of Adam. In this work we are\ninterested in strategies of Eve that minimize her regret. That is to say, we\nare interested in finding a strategy that minimizes the difference between her\nactual payoff and the payoff she could have achieved if she had known the\nstrategy of Adam in advance. We give algorithms to compute the strategies of\nEve that ensure minimal regret against an adversary whose choice of strategy is\n(i) unrestricted, (ii) limited to positional strategies, or (iii) limited to\nword strategies. We also establish relations between the latter version and\nother problems studied in the literature.","authors":["Paul Hunter","Guillermo A.
