{"id":"220812877_Predicting_Learnt_Clauses_Quality_in_Modern_SAT_Solvers","abstract":"Beside impressive progresses made by SAT solvers over the last ten years, only few works tried to un- derstand why Conflict Directed Clause Learning algorithms (CDCL) are so strong and efficient on most industrial applications. We report in this work a key observation of CDCL solvers behavior on this family of benchmarks and explain it by an unsus- pected side effect of their particular Clause Learn- ing scheme. This new paradigm allows us to solve an important, still open, question: How to design- ing a fast, static, accurate, and predictive measure of new learnt clauses pertinence. Our paper is fol- lowed by empirical evidences that show how our new learning scheme improves state-of-the art re- sults by an order of magnitude on both SAT and UNSAT industrial problems.","authors":["Gilles Audemard","Laurent Simon"],"meta":["July 2009","SourceDBLP","Conference: IJCAI 2009, Proceedings of the 21st International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Pasadena, California, USA, July 11-17, 2009"],"references":["220643563_A_survey_of_recent_advances_in_SAT-based_formal_verification_Int_J_Softw_Tools_Technol_Transf_STTT","220163290_PicoSAT_Essentials","2871393_Backdoors_To_Typical_Case_Complexity","2799095_Ten_Challenges_in_Propositional_Reasoning_and_Search","2327034_Heavy-Tailed_Phenomena_in_Satisfiability_and_Constraint_Satisfaction_Problems","284411763_An_extensible_SAT-solver","2409503_Chaff_Engineering_an_Efficient_SAT_Solver"]}
