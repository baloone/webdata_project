{"id":"289047637_Axiomatizing_subtyped_delimited_continuations","abstract":"We present direct equational axiomatizations of the call-by-value lambda calculus with the control operators shift0 and reset0 that generalize Danvy and Filinski's shift and reset in that they allow for abstracting control beyond the top-most delimited continuation. We address an untyped version of the calculus as well as a typed version with effect subtyping. For each of the calculi we present a set of axioms that we prove sound and complete with respect to the corresponding CPS translation.","authors":["Marek Materzok"],"meta":["September 2013","DOI:10.4230/LIPIcs.CSL.2013.521"],"references":["220606975_Axioms_for_control_operators_in_the_CPS_hierarchy","221241452_Subtyping_Delimited_Continuations"]}
