{"id":"342718772_Components_of_attentional_effort_for_repeated_tasks","abstract":"This paper identifies four attentional processes that increase efficiency and accuracy in repeated lexicographic tasks using an instructed strategy approach. We propose a framework to decompose attentional effort used to make a decision into four components: Orientation, Wrong Target, Duration, and Repetition. Orientation assesses attention to decision rules and the location of relevant information. Wrong Target measures wasted effort on unneeded information. Duration gauges time spent on each piece of needed information. Repetition measures the number of views on each relevant item. Greater Orientation is associated with lower effort in other components and increased accuracy. Repetition is most variable across individuals but generates the greatest improvement with practice. Duration is less affected by the other components and shows minimal improvement with experience. Finally, Wrong Target is similarly resistant to practice, but it is the only component strongly and positively associated with making errors.","authors":["Andres Musalem","Ricardo Montoya","Martin Mei√üner","Joel Huber"],"meta":["July 2020Journal of Behavioral Decision Making 34(6)","DOI:10.1002/bdm.2188"],"references":["321759050_Prospect_Theory_Reflects_Selective_Allocation_of_Attention","320409325_Guiding_Decision_Makers'_Eye_Movements_with_UnPredictable_Object_Locations","312298939_Stan_A_Probabilistic_Programming_Language","295084811_Nodule_Detection_with_Eye_Movements","259197439_Understanding_the_exploration-exploitation_dilemma_An_fMRI_study_of_attention_control_and_decision-making_performance","258037261_Testing_Process_Predictions_of_Models_of_Risky_Choice_A_Quantitative_Model_Comparison_Approach","257305901_Eye-Tracking_Reveals_Processes_that_Enable_Conjoint_Choices_to_Become_Increasingly_Efficient_with_Practice","248704649_Attention_and_choice_A_review_on_eye_movements_in_decision_making","241037549_Expertise_Differences_in_the_Comprehension_of_Visualizations_A_Meta-Analysis_of_Eye-Tracking_Research_in_Professional_Domains","236332135_Goldstein_DG_Reasoning_the_fast_and_frugal_way_models_of_bounded_rationality_Psychological_Review_1034_650","232562281_Judging_Probable_Cause","227670470_Predicting_Elections_from_the_Most_Important_Issue_A_Test_of_the_Take-the-Best_Heuristic","227357664_Search_Dynamics_in_Consumer_Choice_under_Time_Pressure_An_Eye-Tracking_Study","49653132_Heuristic_Decision_Making","46379512_Decision_Making_and_the_Avoidance_of_Cognitive_Demand","24098870_An_Eye-Fixation_Analysis_of_Choice_Processes_for_Consumer_Nondurables","23789120_Take-the-Best_in_Expert-Novice_Decision_Strategies_for_Residential_Burglary","4986736_Eye-Movement_Analysis_of_Search_Effectiveness","332442283_Forward_inference_in_risky_choice_Mapping_gaze_and_decision_processes","320163866_Cognitive_costs_of_decision-making_strategies_A_resource_demand_decomposition_with_a_cognitive_architecture","290857549_An_Efficient_Method_of_Estimating_Seemingly_Unrelated_Regression_Equations_and_Tests_for_Aggregation_Bias","282941002_Eye-tracking_Social_Preferences","282153578_Neural_Signatures_of_Controlled_and_Automatic_Retrieval_Processes_in_Memory-based_Decision-making","279433123_Learning_Curve_The","264349730_Exploratory_behavior_in_active_learning_A_between-_and_within-person_examination","257480349_A_review_of_eye-tracking_applications_as_tools_for_training","251744709_Bayesian_Inference_in_the_Seemingly_Unrelated_Regressions_Model","240308599_Expert_intuitions_How_to_model_the_decision_strategies_of_airport_customs_officers","235726165_An_Efficient_Method_of_Estimating_Seemingly_Unrelated_Regressions_and_Tests_of_Aggretion_Bias","232969767_Automatic_activation_of_attribute_knowledge_in_heuristic_inference_from_memory","232602411_Eye_Movement_During_Skill_Acquisition_More_Evidence_for_the_Information-Reduction_Hypothesis","227707529_The_Impact_of_accuracy_and_effort_feedback_and_goals_on_adaptive_decision_behavior","222561781_Towards_an_express-diagnostics_for_level_of_processing_and_hazard_perception","222446013_A_Componential_Analysis_of_Cognitive_Effort_in_Choice","222409016_Expressing_Preferences_in_a_Principal-Agent_Task_A_Comparison_of_Choice_Rating_and_Matching","220259916_The_Use_of_Information_in_Decision_Making_An_Experimental_Investigation_of_the_Impact_of_Computer-Based_Decision_Aids","200045075_Reflections_of_the_Environment_in_Memory","24102964_Rational_Choice_and_the_Framing_of_Decisions","24063465_Global_and_local_covert_visual_attention_Evidence_from_a_Bayesian_Hidden_Markov_model","17346057_Multiple_Probability-Learning_with_Shifting_Weights_of_Cues","13606182_Contextual_Cueing_Implicit_Learning_and_Memory_of_Visual_Context_Guides_Spatial_Attention","12276847_Refixation_frequency_and_memory_mechanisms_in_visual_search","5554524_Heuristics_Made_Easy_An_Effort-Reduction_Framework","4818711_A_Comparison_of_Two_Process_Tracing_Methods_for_Choice_Tasks","4817444_Anticipations_of_Effort_and_Accuracy_in_Multiattribute_Choice"]}
