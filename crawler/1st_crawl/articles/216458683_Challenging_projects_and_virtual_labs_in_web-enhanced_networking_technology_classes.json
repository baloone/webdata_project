The project-based approach motivates students in selecting topics for their technology overviews and research projects and provides them with knowledge, instructions, and hands-on experience.","authors":["Vladimir Riabov"],"meta":["January 2006","Project: Educational Research"],"references":["245741259_COMPUTATIONAL_AND_ANALYTICAL_METHODS_IN_THE_AIRCRAFT_DESIGN_CURRICULUM","294161649_Total_graduate_enrollments_rise_number_of_foreign_students_drops","293203436_2002-2003_Taulbee_survey","265371443_Computer_science_An_overview","261056412_Digital_video_cluster_simulation","248277328_USING_OMNET_TO_SIMULATE_A_HETEROGENOUS_DIGITAL_VIDEO_CLUSTER_FABRIC","247166740_PERSONAL_ENCRYPTED_TALK_-_SECURING_INSTANT_MESSAGING_WITH_A_JAVA_APPLICATION","246787326_McGraw-Hill_Encyclopedia_of_Networking_Telecommunications","246074001_Enrollment_of_foreign_students_drops_in_US","245912308_Development_of_Laboratory_Exercises_Based_On_OPNET_IT_Guru_Academic_Version"]}
