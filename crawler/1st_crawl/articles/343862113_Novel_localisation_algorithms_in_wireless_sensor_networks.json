{"id":"343862113_Novel_localisation_algorithms_in_wireless_sensor_networks","abstract":"Localisation precision is one of the predominant challenges in static and mobile wireless sensor networks. It is a critical issue to be tackled when developing applications that rely on this type of networks. This paper presents three localisation techniques, named eDV-Hop1, eDV-Hop2, and eDV-Hop3, based on geometry principles. The performance of these techniques was evaluated using the network simulator (OMNeT++) and compared to the basic DV-Hop, iDV-Hop1, and iDV-Hop2. Results show that significant improvement is obtained in terms of energy consumption and localisation error according to several parameters, mainly the number of sensors, the number of anchor nodes, and the communication range of sensor nodes.","authors":["Abdelali Hadir","Khalid Zine-dine","Mohamed Bakhouya","Jamal el Kafi"],"meta":["January 2019International Journal of Wireless and Mobile Computing 16(1)","DOI:10.1504/IJWMC.2019.097439"],"references":["319937528_Performance_Evaluation_of_DV-Hop_Localization_Algorithm_for_Geographical_Routing_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","301248720_An_Improved_DV-Hop_Localization_Algorithm_Based_on_Bat_Algorithm","283001984_An_efficient_convex_constrained_weighted_least_squares_source_localization_algorithm_based_on_TDOA_measurements","276298496_RSS-Based_Localization_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_Using_Convex_Relaxation_Noncooperative_and_Cooperative_Schemes","274318996_Improvements_of_DV-Hop_localization_algorithm_for_wireless_sensor_networks","322319151_An_Enhanced_DV-Hop_for_Nodes_Localization_in_Static_and_Mobile_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","299453318_LSDV-Hop_Least_Squares_Based_DV-Hop_Localization_Algorithm_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","277661045_DV-hop_node_localisation_algorithm_with_multi-mobile_beacons_in_wireless_sensor_networks","273397097_Toward_Accurate_Human_Tracking_Modeling_Time-of-Arrival_for_Wireless_Wearable_Sensors_in_Multipath_Environment","272963659_A_localization_algorithm_based_on_SFLA_and_PSO_for_wireless_sensor_network"]}
