{"id":"311161905_Translating_Artificial_Intelligence_Into_Clinical_Care","abstract":"In this issue of JAMA, Gulshan and colleagues‚Åµ present findings from a study evaluating the use of deep learning for detection of diabetic retinopathy and macular edema. To build their model, the authors collected 128 175 annotated images from the EyePACs database. Each image was rated by 3 to 7 clinicians for referable diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema, and overall image quality. Each rater was selected from a panel of 54 board-certified ophthalmologists and senior ophthalmology residents. Using this data set, the algorithm learned to predict the consensus grade of the raters along each clinical attribute: referable diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema, and image quality. To validate their algorithm, the authors assessed its performance on 2 separate and nonoverlapping data sets consisting of 9963 and 1748 images. On the validation data, the algorithm had high sensitivity and specificity. Only one of these values (sensitivity on the second validation data set) failed to be superior at a statistically significant level. The other performance metrics (eg, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, negative predictive value, positive predictive value) were likewise impressive, giving the authors confidence that this algorithm could be of clinical utility.","authors":["Andrew Lane Beam","Isaac S.
