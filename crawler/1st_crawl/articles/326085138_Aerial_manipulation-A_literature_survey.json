{"id":"326085138_Aerial_manipulation-A_literature_survey","abstract":"This paper presents a literature survey on aerial manipulation. First of all, an extensive study of aerial vehicles and manipulation/interaction mechanisms in aerial manipulation is presented. Various combinations of aerial vehicles and manipulators and their applications in different missions are discussed. Next, two main modeling methods and a detailed investigation of existing estimation and control techniques in aerial manipulation are explained. Finally the shortcomings of current aerial manipulation research are highlighted and a number of directions for future research are suggested.","authors":["Hossein Bonyan Khamseh","Farrokh Janabi-Sharifi","Abdelkader Abdessameud"],"meta":["June 2018Robotics and Autonomous Systems 107","DOI:10.1016/j.robot.2018.06.012"],"references":["287974421_Hybrid_Visual_Servoing_With_Hierarchical_Task_Composition_for_Aerial_Manipulation","285779561_Visual_Servoing_of_Quadrotors_for_Perching_by_Hanging_From_Cylindrical_Objects","312312842_High_accuracy_visual_servoing_for_aerial_manipulation_using_a_7_degrees_of_freedom_industrial_manipulator","311334709_Trajectory_Generation_for_Unmanned_Aerial_Manipulators_Through_Quadratic_Programming","292346039_Vision-Guided_Aerial_Manipulation_Using_a_Multirotor_With_a_Robotic_Arm"]}
