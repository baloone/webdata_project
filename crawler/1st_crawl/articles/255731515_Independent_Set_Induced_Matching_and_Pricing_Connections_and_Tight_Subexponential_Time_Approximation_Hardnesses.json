{"id":"255731515_Independent_Set_Induced_Matching_and_Pricing_Connections_and_Tight_Subexponential_Time_Approximation_Hardnesses","abstract":"We present a series of almost settled inapproximability results for three\nfundamental problems. The first in our series is the subexponential-time\ninapproximability of the maximum independent set problem, a question studied in\nthe area of parameterized complexity. The second is the hardness of\napproximating the maximum induced matching problem on bounded-degree bipartite\ngraphs. The last in our series is the tight hardness of approximating the\nk-hypergraph pricing problem, a fundamental problem arising from the area of\nalgorithmic game theory. In particular, assuming the Exponential Time\nHypothesis, our two main results are:\n- For any r larger than some constant, any r-approximation algorithm for the\nmaximum independent set problem must run in at least\n2^{n^{1-\\epsilon}/r^{1+\\epsilon}} time. This nearly matches the upper bound of\n2^{n/r} (Cygan et al., 2008). It also improves some hardness results in the\ndomain of parameterized complexity (e.g., Escoffier et al., 2012 and Chitnis et\nal., 2013)\n- For any k larger than some constant, there is no polynomial time min\n(k^{1-\\epsilon}, n^{1/2-\\epsilon})-approximation algorithm for the k-hypergraph\npricing problem, where n is the number of vertices in an input graph. This\nalmost matches the upper bound of min (O(k), \\tilde O(\\sqrt{n})) (by Balcan and\nBlum, 2007 and an algorithm in this paper).\nWe note an interesting fact that, in contrast to n^{1/2-\\epsilon} hardness\nfor polynomial-time algorithms, the k-hypergraph pricing problem admits\nn^{\\delta} approximation for any \\delta >0 in quasi-polynomial time. This puts\nthis problem in a rare approximability class in which approximability\nthresholds can be improved significantly by allowing algorithms to run in\nquasi-polynomial time.","authors":["Parinya Chalermsook","Bundit Laekhanukit","Danupon Nanongkai"],"meta":["August 2013Foundations of Computer Science, 1975., 16th Annual Symposium on","DOI:10.1109/FOCS.2013.47","SourcearXiv","Project: A Fine-grained Study of NP-hard problems"],"references":["267113798_Improved_Hardness_Results_for_Profit_Maximization_Pricing_Problems_with_Unlimited_Supply","321145485_Query_efficient_PCPs_with_perfect_completeness","307767637_On_the_Complexity_of_Scheduling_in_Wireless_Networks","268072213_Lower_bounds_based_on_the_exponential_time_hypothesis","265633140_Linear_Processes_in_Function_Space","265367511_Applied_Functional_Data_Analysis_Methods_and_Case_Studies","264957871_Local_Polynomial_Modelling_and_Its_Application","262170383_Approximation_resistance_from_pairwise_independent_subgroups","255965613_Fixed-Parameter_and_Approximation_Algorithms_A_New_Look","251351298_Clique_is_hard_to_approximate_within"]}
