{"id":"321191265_E_-_Governance_Implementation_and_Public_Service_Delivery_in_Nigeria_The_Technology_Acceptance_Model_TAM_Application","abstract":"The aim of this paper is to explain the relationship between e-governance implementation and public service delivery in Nigeria using the Technology Acceptance Model. The paper is qualitative in nature and relies on secondary sources for data collection and the discussion that followed. The paper found that there are certain obstacles that hinder the adoption and effective implementation of e-governance that would have engendered qualitative service delivery in public sector organisations in Nigeria. It is in line with the foregoing, that this paper concludes that tackling the obstacles to e-governance adoption, implementation is key to the achievement of better public service delivery. The paper therefore recommends the sensitization of public servants on the importance and benefits of adopting and implementing e-governance in their administrative and organizational processes that will ultimately lead to improved service delivery in Nigeria among others.","authors":["Olalekan Ajibade","Jide Ibietan","Oludare Ayelabola"],"meta":["November 2017Journal of Public Administration and Governance 7(4):165","DOI:10.5296/jpag.v7i4.11475"],"references":["332181894_Threats_to_E-Government_Implementation_in_the_Civil_Service_Nigeria_as_a_Case_Study","329221861_NEW_WINE_IN_OLD_WINE_SKIN_AN_EXPLORATION_OF_MAJOR_CONSTRAINTS_TO_E-GOVERNMENT_IMPLEMENTATION_IN_NIGERIA","292151098_Challenges_of_E-Government_Implementation_in_the_Nigerian_Public_Service","220259897_User_Acceptance_of_Information_Technology_Toward_a_Unified_View","267449521_E-governance_An_imperative_for_sustainable_grass_root_development_in_Nigeria","265261495_Recent_related_research_in_technology_acceptance_model_A_literature_review","257244384_Electronic_Governance_for_Sustainable_Development_-_Conceptual_framework_and_state_of_research","243460308_Committed_to_quality_The_use_of_quality_schemes_in_UK_public_leisure_services","44839301_Reinventing_Government_in_the_Information_Age_International_Practice_in_IT-Enabled_Public_Sector_Reform","44824515_World_Development_Report_Knowledge_for_Development"]}
