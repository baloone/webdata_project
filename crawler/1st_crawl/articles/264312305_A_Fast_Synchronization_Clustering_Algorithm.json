{"id":"264312305_A_Fast_Synchronization_Clustering_Algorithm","abstract":"This paper presents a Fast Synchronization Clustering algorithm (FSynC),\nwhich is an improved version of SynC algorithm. In order to decrease the time\ncomplexity of the original SynC algorithm, we combine grid cell partitioning\nmethod and Red-Black tree to construct the near neighbor point set of every\npoint. By simulated experiments of some artificial data sets and several real\ndata sets, we observe that FSynC algorithm can often get less time than SynC\nalgorithm for many kinds of data sets. At last, it gives some research\nexpectations to popularize this algorithm.","authors":["Xinquan Chen"],"meta":["January 2017Applied Intelligence 46(1)","DOI:10.1007/s10489-016-0814-y","SourcearXiv"],"references":["266660431_Prototype-based_learning_on_concept-drifting_data_streams","313487833_A_tutorial_on_spectral_clustering","312388900_STING_A_statistical_information_grid_approach_to_spatial_data_mining","305397619_Data_Clustering_A_Review","302994566_A_hierarchical_clustering_method_based_on_a_dynamic_synchronization_model","299725102_Robust_Synchronization-Based_Graph_Clustering","292773066_Mean_shift_towards_feature_space_analysis","283746741_Two-level_leader-follower_organization_in_pigeon_flocks","280939909_Graph_Clustering","266081696_A_New_Clustering_Algorithm_Based_on_Near_Neighbor_Influence","264200802_Route-dependent_switch_between_hierarchical_and_egalitarian_strategies_in_pigeon_flocks","261404897_Basin_of_Attraction_Determines_Hysteresis_in_Explosive_Synchronization","263476029_Machine_learning_Clustering_by_fast_search_and_find_of_density_peaks","260324753_Synchronization-Inspired_Partitioning_and_Hierarchical_Clustering","257580466_Clustering_based_on_a_near_neighbor_graph_and_a_grid_cell_graph"]}
