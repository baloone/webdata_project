{"id":"332126538_Semi-Explicit_Composition_Methods_in_Memcapacitor_Circuit_Simulation","abstract":"Composition algorithms make up a prospective class of methods for solving ordinary differential equations. Their main advantage is an ability to retain some properties of the simulated continuous systems, e.g. phase space volume. Meanwhile, computational costs of composition solvers for non-Hamiltonian systems are high because the implicit midpoint rule should be used as a basic method. This also complicates the development of embedded applications based on the numerical solution of ODEs, such as hardware chaos generators. In this article, a new semi-explicit composition methods are proposed. The stability regions for different composition algorithms were plotted and a memcapacitor circuit was studied as a test problem. Computational experiments reveal the superior properties of semi-explicit composition algorithms as a hardware-targeted ODE solvers. The obtained results imply that the development of semi-explicit composition algorithms is a step towards construction a new generation of simulation software for nonlinear dynamical systems and embedded chaos generators.","authors":["Denis Butusov","Valerii Ostrovskii","Artur I.
