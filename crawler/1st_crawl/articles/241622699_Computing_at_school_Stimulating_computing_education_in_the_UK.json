{"id":"241622699_Computing_at_school_Stimulating_computing_education_in_the_UK","abstract":"In this paper, we present the development of Computing at School (CAS), a UK membership association established in 2008 to promote and support the teaching of Computing and related disciplines in UK schools. Its membership is broad and includes teachers, parents, examiners, university faculty, professional societies and industry.\nCAS was born out of a serious concern that many students in the UK are disengaging from Computing as a discipline. The goal of CAS is to put the excitement back into Computing at school, as well as to influence Computing education policy in the UK, especially improving the wider perception of the discipline and its position within the STEM subject area.","authors":["Tom Crick","Sue Sentance"],"meta":["November 2011","DOI:10.1145/2094131.2094158"],"references":["221537542_A_model_for_high_school_computer_science_education_the_four_key_elements_that_make_it","269033725_A_model_for_high_school_computer_science_education","238683585_A-level_computing_its_content_and_value","220423368_The_Long_Road_to_Computer_Science_Education_Reform"]}
