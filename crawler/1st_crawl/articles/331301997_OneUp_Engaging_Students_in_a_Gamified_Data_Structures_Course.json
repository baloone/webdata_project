{"id":"331301997_OneUp_Engaging_Students_in_a_Gamified_Data_Structures_Course","abstract":"Although many CS courses require extensive practice, a large number of students show low motivation for engaging in non-graded, self-directed learning activities. To address this problem, we developed OneUp - a highly configurable course gamification platform that enables instructors to tailor the gamification features to fit their preferences. This paper presents a case study of using OneUp to gamify a Data Structures course. The focus is on encouraging students' self-study and better engagement with out-of-class online practicing. We describe the utilized game elements - badges, leaderboard, virtual currency, and learning dashboards, and provide a descriptive analysis of their use. The results of our evaluation show that this gamification intervention has been well received by the students, resulting in significantly increased student engagement and out-of-class practicing and in a reduced failing rate.","authors":["Darina Dicheva","Keith Irwin","Christo Dichev"],"meta":["February 2019","DOI:10.1145/3287324.3287480","Conference: the 50th ACM Technical Symposium","Project: Increasing Student Motivation and Engagement in STEM Courses through Gamification"],"references":["317989666_TrAcademic_Improving_Participation_and_Engagement_in_CS1CS2_with_Gamified_Practicals","297663593_Structuring_Flipped_Classes_with_Lightweight_Teams_and_Gamification","270273830_Gamification_in_Education_A_Systematic_Mapping_Study","269226394_Mastery_grids_An_open-source_social_educational_progress_visualization","266656951_Mastery_Grids_An_Open_Source_Social_Educational_Progress_Visualization","262395542_An_experience_report_on_using_gamification_in_technical_higher_education","260488068_How_Not_to_Introduce_Badges_to_Online_Exercises","327911187_OneUp_Supporting_Practical_and_Experimental_Gamification_of_Learning","303697551_Social_motivations_to_use_gamification_An_empirical_study_of_gamifying_exercise","261844724_A_case_study_in_the_gamification_of_a_university-level_games_development_course"]}
