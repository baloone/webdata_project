{"id":"299364601_Evidence_of_assessing_computational_thinking","abstract":"Computational thinking is at the heart of the new English national curriculum for computing. There is a range of academic and pedagogic interpretations of the concept of computational thinking, a lack of understanding of the concepts and a close association of the subject with writing computer code using a programming language. Teachers might focus on a small aspect of the programme of study, thereby neglecting the breadth of content and the broader aims. In addition, the level descriptors associated with the curriculum have been removed creating a need for assessment guidance. In light of these changes, this paper explores the statutory requirements of the curriculum and the descriptions of computational thinking. It suggests a mechanism for assessment of achievement and progression for both computing and computational thinking.","authors":["Cynthia Selby","Mark Dorling","John Woollard"],"meta":["December 2014","Conference: IFIP TC3 Working Conference: a New Culture of Learning: Computing and Next Generations"],"references":["221538265_Thinking_about_Computational_Thinking","220420371_Computational_thinking","23142610_Computational_thinking_and_thinking_about_computing","350684250_A_Practical_Guide_to_Teaching_ICT_in_the_Secondary_School","265286561_Computational_Thinking_is_Pervasive","257926465_Instructional_design_theories_and_models_A_new_paradigm_of_instructional_theory","229464044_The_'freedom_to_frame_questions_worth_asking'_or_three_stories_and_three_other_fragments_of_research"]}
