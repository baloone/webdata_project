The main results, obtained from 163 students by using the Vallerand academic motivation scale (Vallerand et al., 1989) pre-test and post-test, highlight the positive effect of the CBLE, according to certain student characteristics, especially for those students who were initially the least motivated to do mathematics and vice versa. This effect is particularly true when the teacher promotes students’ autonomy.\n\nKeywords: CBLE, mathematics, autonomous motivation, teaching methods\nhttps://journals.sfu.ca/cje/index.php/cje-rce/article/view/4431","authors":["Dumas Reyssier Stéphanie","Simonian Stephane"],"meta":["March 2021Canadian Journal of Education / Revue canadienne de l éducation 44(1):116-149","DOI:10.53967/cje-rce.v44i1.4431","Project: écologie"],"references":["336711359_Factors_to_Consider_for_Tailored_Gamification","324430336_Adaptive_Gamification_for_Learning_Environments","313343997_The_important_role_of_the_context_in_which_achievement_goals_are_adopted_an_experimental_test","336639395_La_frequence_d'utilisation_de_la_tablette_numerique_a_des_fins_pedagogiques_et_le_rendement_scolaire_des_eleves_le_role_mediateur_de_la_motivation_autodeterminee","335909013_La_recherche_fondamentale_de_terrain_une_troisieme_voie","331933777_Adaptability_of_Learning_Games_Based_on_Learner_Profiles_in_the_Context_of_Autonomous_Training","324975110_The_association_for_computing_machinery","324046261_The_Social_Psychology_of_Creativity","321736504_Apprentissages_scolaires_et_technologies_numeriques_Une_revue_critique_des_meta-analyses","315473130_Personalization_of_gamification-elements_in_an_e-learning_environment_based_on_learners'_motivation","309006949_Studying_student_differentiation_in_gamified_education_A_long-term_study","305510182_Intrinsic_Motivation_and_Achievement_in_Mathematics_in_Elementary_School_A_Longitudinal_Investigation_of_Their_Association","303169056_An_overview_of_self-determination_theory_An_organismic_dialectical_perspective","303151640_A_hierarchical_model_of_intrinsic_and_extrinsic_motivation_for_sport_and_physical_activity","301904063_PISA_2012_How_do_results_for_the_paper_and_computer_tests_compare"]}
