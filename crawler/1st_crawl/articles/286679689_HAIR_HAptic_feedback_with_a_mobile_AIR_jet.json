{"id":"286679689_HAIR_HAptic_feedback_with_a_mobile_AIR_jet","abstract":"Haptic devices are dedicated to render virtual tactile stimulation. A limitation of these devices is the intrusiveness of their mechanical structures, i.e. The user need to hold or wear the device to interact with the environment. Here, we propose a concept of new tactile device named HAIR. The device is composed of a computer vision system, a mechatronic device and air jets that stimulate the skin. We designed a first prototype and conducted a preliminary experiment to validate our concept. The interface enables a tactile interaction without using physical contact with material devices, providing better freedom of movement and enhancing the interaction transparency.","authors":["Yassine Tsa","Paul Issartel","Nizar Ouarti","Mehdi Ammi"],"meta":["May 2014Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","DOI:10.1109/ICRA.2014.6907246","Conference: 2014 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","Project: Air Haptic"],"references":["289538791_Non-intrusive_Haptic_Interfaces_State-of-the_Art_Survey","261265041_EmotionAir_Perception_of_Emotions_from_Air_Jet_Based_Tactile_Stimulation","261234748_Psychophysical_study_of_air_jet_based_tactile_stimulation","231513999_Haptic_interfaces_and_devices","228705729_Virtual_reality_in_stroke_rehabilitation_with_the_assistance_of_haptics_and_telemedicine","262402201_AIREAL_Interactive_tactile_experiences_in_free_air","260623646_Characterization_and_Psychophysical_Studies_of_an_Air-Jet_Lump_Display","256157150_A_generalized_inverse_for_matrices","252028751_Human_detection_using_depth_information_by_Kinect","247704148_Techniques_for_generating_the_goal-directed_animation_of_articulated_structures"]}
