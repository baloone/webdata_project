{"id":"319280989_Natural_User_Interface_for_Education_in_Virtual_Environments","abstract":"Education and self-improvement are key features of human behavior. However, learning in the physical world is not always desirable or achievable. That is how simulators came to be. There are domains where purely virtual simulators can be created in contrast to physical ones. In this research we present a novel environment for learning, using a natural user interface. We, humans, are not designed to operate and manipulate objects via keyboard, mouse or a controller. The natural way of interaction and communication is achieved through our actuators (hands and feet) and our sensors (hearing, vision, touch, smell and taste). That is the reason why it makes more sense to use sensors that can track our skeletal movements, are able to estimate our pose, and interpret our gestures. After acquiring and processing the desired â€“ natural input, a system can analyze and translate those gestures into movement signals.","authors":["Stefan Stavrev"],"meta":["March 2016","DOI:10.18778/2391-8551.03.04","Project: PhD research"],"references":["285810494_Presence_pedagogy_Teaching_and_learning_in_a_3D_virtual_immersive_world","278300210_VIRTUAL_ENVIRONMENT_SIMULATOR_FOR_EDUCATIONAL_SAFETY_CROSSING","262545606_Serious_Games_A_New_Paradigm_for_Education","259496289_History_and_comparative_study_of_modern_game_engines","224879736_Innovative_Simulation_Strategies_in_Education","27383991_Building_Virtual_Reality_Environments_for_Distance_Education_on_the_Web_A_Case_Study_in_Medical_Education","23484091_A_Structural_MRI_Study_of_Human_Brain_Development_from_Birth_to_2_Years","286358305_Situated_Learning_in_Virtual_Worlds_and_Immersive_Simulations","263066811_Learning_with_Digital_Games_A_Practical_Guide_to_Engaging_Students_in_Higher_Education_-_By_Nicola_Whitton","243771574_Serious_games_Improving_public_policy_through_game-based_learning_and_simulation"]}
