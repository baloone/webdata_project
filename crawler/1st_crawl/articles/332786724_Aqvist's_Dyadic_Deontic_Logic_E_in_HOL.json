{"id":"332786724_Aqvist's_Dyadic_Deontic_Logic_E_in_HOL","abstract":"We devise a shallow semantical embedding of Åqvist's dyadic deontic logic E in classical higher-order logic. This embedding is shown to be faithful, viz. sound and complete. This embedding is also encoded in Isabelle/HOL, which turns this system into a proof assistant for deontic logic reasoning. The experiments with this environment provide evidence that this logic implementation fruitfully enables interactive and automated reasoning at the meta-level and the object-level.","authors":["Christoph Benzmüller","Ali Farjami","Xavier Parent"],"meta":["August 2019Journal of Applied Logic 6(5):733--755","Project: Normative Reasoning and Machine Ethics"],"references":["332786587_IO_Logic_in_HOL","331908458_Universal_Meta-Logical_Reasoning_The_Wise_Men_Puzzle_IsabelleHOL_Dataset","329070435_A_Dyadic_Deontic_Logic_in_HOL","328893399_Universal_Meta-Logical_Reasoning_Recent_Successes","323392435_Faithful_Semantical_Embedding_of_a_Dyadic_Deontic_Logic_in_HOL","323026923_The_Higher-Order_Prover_Leo-III","321160582_Mechanizing_Principia_Logico-Metaphysica_in_Functional_Type_Theory","297899715_Completeness_and_Decidability_Results_for_CTL_in_Constructive_Type_Theory","293488069_Cut-Elimination_for_Quantified_Conditional_Logic","283549985_Handbook_of_Philosophical_Logic"]}
