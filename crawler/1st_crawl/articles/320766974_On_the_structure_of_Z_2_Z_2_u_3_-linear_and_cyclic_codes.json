{"id":"320766974_On_the_structure_of_Z_2_Z_2_u_3_-linear_and_cyclic_codes","abstract":"Recently some special type of mixed alphabet codes that generalize the standard codes has attracted much attention. Besides Z2Z4-additive codes, Z2Z2[u]-linear codes are introduced as a new member of such families. In this paper, we are interested in a new family of such mixed alphabet codes, i.e., codes over Z2Z2[u3] where Z2[u3]={0,1,u,1+u,u2,1+u2,u+u2,1+u+u2} is an 8-element ring with u3=0. We study and determine the algebraic structures of linear and cyclic codes defined over this family. First, we introduce Z2Z2[u3]-linear codes and give standard forms of generator and parity-check matrices and later we present generators of both cyclic codes and their duals over Z2Z2[u3]. Further, we present some examples of optimal binary codes which are obtained through Gray images of Z2Z2[u3]-cyclic codes.","authors":["Ismail Aydogdu","Irfan Siap","Roger Ten-Valls"],"meta":["November 2017Finite Fields and Their Applications 48(3):241-260","DOI:10.1016/j.ffa.2017.03.001"],"references":["308603176_24-additive_cyclic_codes","278114792_-Additive_Cyclic_Codes","275617426_The_Structure_of_Z2Z2s-Additive_Codes_Bounds_on_the_Minimum_Distance","271942872_On_Z_p_r_Z_p_s_-additive_codes","271665682_On_Z_2_Z_2_u_-additive_codes","267214763_Z2-double_cyclic_codes","257554670_Z2Z4_-linear_codes_Generator_matrices_and_duality","3078458_The_Z4-linearity_of_Kerdock_Preparata_Goethals_and_related_codes","313592878_mathbb_Z_2_Z_2_-double_cyclic_codes","310789947_Z2Z2u-Cyclic_and_Constacyclic_Codes","309057247_Z2Z4-additive_cyclic_codes_generator_polynomials_and_dual_codes","225163313_Cyclic_codes_over_the_rings_Z2_uZ2_and_Z2_uZ2_u2Z2","220639309_Cyclic_codes_over_the_rings_Z"]}
