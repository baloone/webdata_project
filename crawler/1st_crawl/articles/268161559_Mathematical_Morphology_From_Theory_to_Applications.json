{"id":"268161559_Mathematical_Morphology_From_Theory_to_Applications","abstract":"This chapter endeavors to introduce in a concise way the main aspects of Mathematical Morphology, as well as what constitutes its field. The framework of mathematical morphology encompasses many various mathematical disciplines from set theory including lattice theory, randomsets, probabilities, measure theory, topology, discrete and continuous geometry, as well as algorithmic considerations and finally applications. The main principle of morphological analysis is to extract knowledge from the response of various transformations which are generally nonlinear. Residues are generally well behaved in morphology, precisely because the basic properties of morphological operators are in our favour. Granulometric curves by openings make it possible to estimate the size of peaks in images, while granulometries by closings measure the size of troughs. mathematical morphology; set theory","authors":["Laurent Najman","Hugues Talbot"],"meta":["February 2013","DOI:10.1002/9781118600788.ch1"],"references":["253868038_n-dimensional_skeletonization_A_unified_mathematical_framework","246105052_Euclidean_skeletons_and_conditional_bisectors","243685752_On_The_Geodesic_Property_Of_Strain_Field_Patterns_In_Elastoplastic_Composites","243381877_Multi-scale_analysis_of_the_dielectric_properties_and_structure_of_resincarbon-black_nanocomposites","241195617_LETTER_TO_THE_EDITOR_Precise_determination_of_the_critical_threshold_and_exponents_in_a_three-dimensional_continuum_percolation_model","240527220_Information_extraction_from_very_high_resolution_satellite_imagery_over_Lukole_refugee_camp_Tanzania","319978827_Completely_distributive_complete_lattices","313744046_On_the_estimation_of_mean_values_in_individual_analysis_of_particles","312663049_Nouvelles_Observations_sur_les_lignes_de_faite_et_de_thalweg","306159694_Directional_mathematical_morphology_for_oriented_image_restoration_and_segmentation","299632041_Visual_psychophysics_and_color_appearance","285347259_On_P-simple_points","285276915_Skeletonization_in_Quantitative_Metallography","284925979_The_determination_of_the_size_distribution_of_ellipsoidal_particles_from_measurements_made_on_random_plane_sections","284690009_Morphological_analysis_of_carbon-polymer_composite_materials_from_thick_sections","284649033_Procede_mecanique_pour_determiner_la_composition_des_roches","278688476_Studies_in_Fuzziness_and_Soft_Computing","277437680_Morphological_operations_for_color_image_processing","268028709_Hausdorff_distances_and_interpolations","267066474_Combinations_of_closure_relations","267006112_A_characterization_of_SD-rings_of_subsets","265452120_Applications_residuees","265359129_Shape_Recognition_Prairie_Fires_Convex_Deficiencies_and_Skeletons","262401144_Total_ordering_based_on_space_filling_curves_for_multivalued_morphology","260965278_Mathematical_morphology_for_angle-valued_images","256404100_The_Boolean_Model_and_Random_Sets","252457229_Morphological_operators_for_color_image_processing_based_on_Mahalanobis_distance_measure","252232483_Measuring_document_image_skew_and_orientation","248808823_Optimal_removal_of_spurious_pits_in_grid_digital_elevation_models","248497058_Zur_Grundlegung_der_Booleschen_Algebra","247601450_Spatial_birth-and-death_processes","247036753_On_the_Elimination_of_Edge_Effects_in_Planar_Sampling","246838897_Mixed-method_identifica-tions","246340214_Graph_morphology_in_image_analysis","246179365_Extensive_operators_in_partition_lattices_for_image_sequence_analysis","246086779_Ergodicity_and_integral_range","244439803_Region_Extraction_and_Shape_Analysis_in_Aerial_Photographs","243973453_Fuzzy_Pattern_Matching","243310888_Morphological_phase_unwrapping","243075159_Closure_operators_and_Galois_theory_in_lattices","242822604_Adaptive_rank-order_filters_for_image_processing_based_on_local_anisotropy_measures","242820932_A_Lattice-Theoretical_Morphological_View_on_Template_Extraction_in_Images","242801176_Morphological_systems_Slope_transforms_and_max-min_difference_and_differential_equations","242400580_On_critical_kernels","240426994_Complex_Shape_Characterization_by_Statistical_Analysis_Application_to_Aluminium_Alloys","239059528_Morphological_multiscale_segmentation_for_image_coding","238802967_Contrast_and_activity_lattice","238801181_Distances_between_fuzzy_sets","235185418_An_Associative_Machine_for_Dealing_with_the_Visual_Field_and_Some_of_Its_Biological_Implications","234803798_Document_analysis_system_IBM_J_Res_Dev","234796450_A_Method_for_Obtaining_Skeletons_Using_a_Quasi-Euclidean_Distance","233835811_On_Hills_and_Dales","230837971_Computational_Imaging_and_Vision","230837969_Filters_and_lattices","230837938_An_Efficient_Algorithm_for_Drainage_Network_Extraction_on_DEMs"]}
