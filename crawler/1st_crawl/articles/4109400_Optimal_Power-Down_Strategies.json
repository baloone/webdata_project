{"id":"4109400_Optimal_Power-Down_Strategies","abstract":"We consider the problem of selecting threshold times to transition a device to low-power sleep states during an idle period. The two-state case in which there is a single active and a single sleep state is a continuous version of the ski-rental problem. We consider a generalized version in which there is more than one sleep state, each with its own power consumption rate and transition costs. We give an algorithm that, given a system, produces a deterministic strategy whose competitive ratio is arbitrarily close to optimal. We also give an algorithm to produce the optimal online strategy given a system and a probability distribution that generates the length of the idle period. We also give a simple algorithm that achieves a competitive ratio of 3 + 2√2 ≈ 5.828 for any system.","authors":["John Augustine","Sandy Irani","Chaitanya Swamy"],"meta":["November 2004Foundations of Computer Science, 1975., 16th Annual Symposium on 37(5):530- 539","DOI:10.1109/FOCS.2004.50","SourceIEEE Xplore","Conference: Foundations of Computer Science, 2004.
