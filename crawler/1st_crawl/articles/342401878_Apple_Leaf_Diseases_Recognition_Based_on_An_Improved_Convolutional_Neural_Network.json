{"id":"342401878_Apple_Leaf_Diseases_Recognition_Based_on_An_Improved_Convolutional_Neural_Network","abstract":"Scab, frogeye spot, and cedar rust are three common types of apple leaf diseases, and the rapid diagnosis and accurate identification of them play an important role in the development of apple production. In this work, an improved model based on VGG16 is proposed to identify apple leaf diseases, in which the global average poling layer is used to replace the fully connected layer to reduce the parameters and a batch normalization layer is added to improve the convergence speed. A transfer learning strategy is used to avoid a long training time. The experimental results show that the overall accuracy of apple leaf classification based on the proposed model can reach 99.01%. Compared with the classical VGG16, the model parameters are reduced by 89%, the recognition accuracy is improved by 6.3%, and the training time is reduced to 0.56% of that of the original model. Therefore, the deep convolutional neural network model proposed in this work provides a better solution for the identification of apple leaf diseases with higher accuracy and a faster convergence speed.","authors":["Qian Yan","Baohua Yang","Wenyan Wang","Bing Wang"],"meta":["June 2020Sensors 20(12):3535","DOI:10.3390/s20123535"],"references":["338142077_Occurrence_prediction_of_pests_and_diseases_in_cotton_on_the_basis_of_weather_factors_by_long_short_term_memory_network","336517283_Evaluation_of_Aboveground_Nitrogen_Content_of_Winter_Wheat_Using_Digital_Imagery_of_Unmanned_Aerial_Vehicles","336061238_Classification_of_Plant_Leaf_Diseases_Based_on_Improved_Convolutional_Neural_Network","332937900_Automatic_Localization_and_Count_of_Agricultural_Crop_Pests_Based_on_an_Improved_Deep_Learning_Pipeline","329263432_Insect_Detection_and_Classification_Based_on_an_Improved_Convolutional_Neural_Network","322142005_Identification_of_Apple_Leaf_Diseases_Based_on_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","322060135_Unpaired_Image-to-Image_Translation_Using_Cycle-Consistent_Adversarial_Networks","320966887_Image-to-Image_Translation_with_Conditional_Adversarial_Networks","325612493_Identification_of_Maize_Leaf_Diseases_Using_Improved_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","319952138_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_with_transfer_learning_for_computer_vision-based_data-driven_pavement_distress_detection"]}
