{"id":"340769608_A_Numerical_Pinch_Analysis_Methodology_for_Optimal_Sizing_of_a_Centralized_Trigeneration_System_with_Variable_Energy_Demands","abstract":"The energy and power sectors are critical sectors, especially as energy demands rise every year. Increasing energy demand will lead to an increase in fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. Improving the thermal efficiency of conventional power systems is one way to reduce fuel consumption and carbon emissions. The previous study has developed a new methodology called Trigeneration System Cascade Analysis (TriGenSCA) to optimise the sizing of power, heating, and cooling in a trigeneration system for a Total Site system. However, the method only considered a single period on heating and cooling demands. In industrial applications, there are also batches, apart from continuous plants. The multi-period is added in the analysis to meet the time constraints in batch plants. This paper proposes the development of an optimal trigeneration system based on the Pinch Analysis (PA) methodology by minimizing cooling, heating, and power requirements, taking into account energy variations in the total site energy system. Uranium-235 to an average demand load of 93 GWh/d. The results of trigeneration PWR NPP with and without the integration of the Total Site system is compared and proven that trigeneration PWR NPP with integration is a suitable technology that can save up to 0.2% of the equivalent annual cost and 1.4% of energy compared to trigeneration PWR NPP without integration.","authors":["Khairulnadzmi Jamaluddin","Sharifah Rafidah","Khaidzir Hamzah","Jiri Jaromir Kleme≈°"],"meta":["April 2020Energies 13(2038)","DOI:10.3390/en13082038","Project: Sustainable Process Integration Laboratory"],"references":["344360516_Direct_and_Indirect_Integration_of_Organic_Rankine_Cycle_in_Total_Site","337031586_Balancing_wind-power_fluctuation_via_onsite_storage_under_uncertainty_Power-to-hydrogen-to-power_versus_lithium_battery","331852085_A_Process_Integration_Method_for_Total_Site_Cooling_Heating_and_Power_Optimisation_with_Trigeneration_Systems","331803807_Extended_Electric_System_Cascade_Analysis_ESCA_for_optimal_power_system_targeting_considering_generation_flexibility_and_heat_rate_factor","331680309_Design_of_Robust_Total_Site_Heat_Recovery_Loops_via_Monte_Carlo_Simulation","331490015_Thermal_Analysis_of_an_Absorption_and_Adsorption_Cooling_Chillers_Using_a_Modulating_Tempering_Valve","332967102_Customised_retrofit_of_heat_exchanger_network_combining_area_distribution_and_targeted_investment","332524898_Iterative_Pinch_Analysis_to_Address_Non-linearity_in_a_Stochastic_Pinch_Problem","332328032_Next_generation_cogeneration_system_for_industry_-_Combined_heat_and_fuel_plant_using_biomass_resources","332236143_Life_cycle_to_Pinch_Analysis_and_100_renewable_energy_systems_in_a_circular_economy_at_sustainable_development_of_energy_Water_and_Environment_Systems_2017"]}
