{"id":"348900638_On_Lexicographic_Products_of_Two_Fuzzy_Graphs","abstract":"In this paper, lexicographic products of two fuzzy graphs namely, lexicographic min-product and lexicographic max-product which are analogous to the concept lexicographic product in crisp graph theory are defined. It is illustrated that the operations lexicographic products are not commutative. The connected, effective and complete properties of the operations lexicographic products are studied. The degree of a vertex in the lexicographic products of two fuzzy graphs is obtained. A relationship between the lexicographic min-product and lexicographic max-product is also obtained.","authors":["RADHA K","Sivabalan Arumugam"],"meta":["January 2015"],"references":["348900312_On_Direct_Sum_of_Two_Fuzzy_Graphs","264731298_Conjunction_of_two_Fuzzy_Graphs","264726618_Regular_Properties_of_Fuzzy_Graphs","348900828_On_Strong_Product_of_Two_Fuzzy_Graphs","242794179_Some_remarks_on_fuzzy_graphs","220314865_Operations_on_Fuzzy_Graphs"]}
