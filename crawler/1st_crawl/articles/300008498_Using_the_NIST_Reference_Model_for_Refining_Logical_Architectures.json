{"id":"300008498_Using_the_NIST_Reference_Model_for_Refining_Logical_Architectures","abstract":"The emergence of the Internet as a ubiquitous means of communication fostered the growth of new business and service models based on Cloud Computing. Information and Communication Technology companies use reference models to define their Cloud Computing strategies. NIST Cloud Computing Reference Architecture is one of these reference models that assist in the design of business, services, and architecture models. This paper aims to present the use of NIST reference architecture in the design of Cloud Computing architectures by employing a method that enables the application of the reference architecture to the refinement of logical architectures.","authors":["António Pereira","Ricardo-J.
