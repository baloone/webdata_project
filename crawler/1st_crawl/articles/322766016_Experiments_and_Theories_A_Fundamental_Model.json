{"id":"322766016_Experiments_and_Theories_A_Fundamental_Model","abstract":"A fundamental model of experiments and their relationship to theories is offered. The physical\nnature of the model should be seen as a reflection of the epistemic and ontic nature of physics required by\nquantum theory, as well as the causal models of general relativistic space-times. By encoding experiments\nas Monads, we see them as physical aspects of nature. By the Adjoint Functor Theorem, theories are\nbound to experiments in a way that is deeply meaningful, and essentially mechanical.","authors":["Ben Sprott"],"meta":["January 2017","Project: Foundations of Physics and Science: Data and Theories"],"references":["4085205_A_categorical_semantics_of_quantum_protocols","2830729_Discrete_Quantum_Causal_Dynamics","2191968_In_defense_of_the_epistemic_view_of_quantum_states_a_toy_theory","1877299_A_Domain_of_Spacetime_Intervals_in_General_Relativity","51953954_On_the_Reality_of_the_Quantum_State","2185424_Quantum_Theory_From_Five_Reasonable_Axioms"]}
