{"id":"243598210_Making_Computers_Think_Like_People","abstract":"Fuzzy sets are a concept that can bring the reasoning used by computers closer to that used by people. Whereas a conventional, or 'crisp', set has sharp boundaries (such as the set of all numbers greater than 2), the transition between membership and nonmembership in a fuzzy set is gradual rather than sharp. With fuzzy sets, human concepts like 'small', 'big', 'young', 'old', 'high' or 'low' can be translated into a form usable by computers. Fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic are now finding wider and wider application in a broad range of problem solving, from industrial process control and pattern recognition to weather prediction, medical diagnosis, and agricultural planning.","authors":["Lotfi A.
