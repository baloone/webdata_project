{"id":"11317342_Reflections_on_Interdisciplinary_Collaboration_in_the_New_Millennium_Perspectives_and_Challenges","abstract":"In sum, the health, behavioral, and developmental problems of children and adolescents in the new millennium are very complex and are not likely to yield to any simply uniprofessional analysis or solution. No one profession can pretend to pose the proper question, let alone the solutions. So the choice is not whether to work together, but how best to accomplish the collaborative work. I invite others to extend the work on interdisciplinary collaboration that has been described here. It has been an extraordinary collaborative privilege for me to lead SDBP over the past year. I thank you for the opportunity.","authors":["Dennis Drotar"],"meta":["July 2002Journal of developmental and behavioral pediatrics: JDBP 23(3):175-80","DOI:10.1097/00004703-200206000-00012","SourcePubMed"],"references":["290075172_Training_professional_psychologists_to_write_and_publish_The_utility_of_a_writers'_workshop_seminar","271267701_Pediatricians_and_Mental_Health_Professionals","233344879_Integrating_Health_and_Mental_Health_Services_in_the_Care_of_Children_and_Adolescents_With_Chronic_Health_Conditions_Assumptions_Challenges_and_Opportunities","232538947_Training_professional_psychologists_to_write_and_publish_The_utility_of_a_writer's_workshop_seminar_Professional_Psychology_Research_and_Practice_31_453-457","232429282_Training_students_for_careers_in_medical_settings_A_graduate_program_in_pediatric_psychology","19940570_Psychological_Consultation_in_a_Children's_Hospital_An_Evaluation_of_Services","19171575_Suggestions_to_Parents_About_Common_Behavior_Problems_in_a_Pediatric_Primary_Care_Office_Five_Years_of_Follow-Up","14707592_Pediatric_Psychologists'_Perceptions_of_Their_Work_Settings","14707586_Influences_on_Collaborative_Activities_Among_Psychologists_and_Pediatricians_Implications_for_Practice_Training_and_Research","13978705_A_Review_of_Psychosocial_Interventions_for_Children_With_Chronic_Health_Conditions","12483323_Increasing_Identification_of_Psychosocial_Problems_1979-1996"]}
