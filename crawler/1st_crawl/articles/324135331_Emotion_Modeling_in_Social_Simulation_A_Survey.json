{"id":"324135331_Emotion_Modeling_in_Social_Simulation_A_Survey","abstract":"Emotions play a key role in human behavior. Being able to integrate them in models is therefore a major issue to improve the believability of agent-based social simulations. However, and despite the emergence of many emotional models usable for simulations in the last few years, many modelers still tend to use too simple ad hoc emotional models. To support this view, this article proposes a survey of the different practices of modelers in terms of implementations of emotional models, as well as a presentation of different emotional architectures that already exist and that could be used by modelers. The main goal is to understand how emotions are used today in social simulations, in order for the community to unify its uses of emotional agents.","authors":["Mathieu Bourgais","Patrick Taillandier","Laurent Vercouter","Carole A Adam"],"meta":["March 2018Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation, The 21(2)","DOI:10.18564/jasss.3681","Project: ACTEUR"],"references":["318077703_A_Taxonomy_for_Agent-Based_Models_in_Human_Infectious_Disease_Epidemiology","311622984_Emotion_in_the_evacuation_process_formal_model_and_simulation","309599511_From_Beliefs_to_Attitudes_Polias_a_Model_of_Attitude_Dynamics_Based_on_Cognitive_Modeling_and_Field_Data","306074863_BDI_agents_in_social_simulations_a_survey","287159029_AGENT-BASED_CROWD_SIMULATION_CONSIDERING_EMOTION_CONTAGION_FOR_EMERGENCY_EVACUATION_PROBLEM","318077835_Enhancing_the_Realism_of_Simulation_EROS_On_Implementing_and_Developing_Psychological_Theory_in_Social_Simulation","314722666_Emotional_advantage_for_adaptability_and_autonomy","306173633_On_the_nature_and_function_of_emotion_a_component_process_approach","303376123_A_Dynamic_Emotional_Model_for_Agent_Societies","288625654_The_Role_of_Emotions_in_Multiagent_Teamwork"]}
