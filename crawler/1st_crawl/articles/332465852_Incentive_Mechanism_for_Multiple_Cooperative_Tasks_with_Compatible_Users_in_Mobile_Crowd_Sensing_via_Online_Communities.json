{"id":"332465852_Incentive_Mechanism_for_Multiple_Cooperative_Tasks_with_Compatible_Users_in_Mobile_Crowd_Sensing_via_Online_Communities","abstract":"Mobile crowd sensing emerges as a new paradigm which takes advantage of the pervasive sensor-embedded smartphones to collect data. Many incentive mechanisms for mobile crowd sensing have been proposed. However, none of them takes into consideration the cooperative compatibility of users for multiple cooperative tasks. In this paper, we design truthful incentive mechanisms to minimize the social cost such that each of the cooperative tasks can be completed by a group of compatible users. We study two bid models and formulate the Social Optimization Compatible User Selection (SOCUS) problem for each model. We also define three compatibility models and use real-life relationships from social networks to model the compatibility relationships. We design two incentive mechanisms, \n$MCT - M$ \nand \n$MCT - S$ \n, for the compatibility cases. Both of \n$MCT - M$ \nand \n$MCT - S$ \nconsist of two steps: compatible user grouping and reverse auction. We further present a user grouping method through neural network model and clustering algorithm. Through both rigorous theoretical analysis and extensive simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed mechanisms achieve computational efficiency, individual rationality and truthfulness. Moreover, \n$MCT - M$ \ncan output the optimal solution. By using neural network and clustering algorithm for user grouping, the proposed incentive mechanisms can reduce the social cost and overpayment ratio further with less grouping time.","authors":["Jia Xu","Zhengqiang Rao","Lijie Xu","Dejun Yang"],"meta":["July 2020IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing 19(7):1618-1633","DOI:10.1109/TMC.2019.2911512"],"references":["326660121_Improving_Both_Quantity_and_Quality_Incentive_Mechanism_for_Social_Mobile_Crowdsensing_Architecture","325966125_Online_Incentive_Mechanism_for_Mobile_Crowdsourcing_Based_on_Two-Tiered_Social_Crowdsourcing_Architecture","325918702_Quality-Aware_Pricing_for_Mobile_Crowdsensing","321173008_MeLoDy_A_Long-Term_Dynamic_Quality-Aware_Incentive_Mechanism_for_Crowdsourcing","320567412_Mobile_Crowd_Sensing_via_Online_Communities_Incentive_Mechanisms_for_Multiple_Cooperative_Tasks","318123972_Incentivizing_the_Biased_Requesters_Truthful_Task_Assignment_Mechanisms_in_Crowdsourcing","315834599_On_the_Properties_of_the_Softmax_Function_with_Application_in_Game_Theory_and_Reinforcement_Learning","297726419_Incentivize_maximum_continuous_time_interval_coverage_under_budget_constraint_in_mobile_crowd_sensing","291390641_ODMBP_Behavior_Forwarding_for_Multiple_Property_Destinations_in_Mobile_Social_Networks","285728649_Stackelberg_Game_Based_Incentive_Mechanisms_for_Multiple_Collaborative_Tasks_in_Mobile_Crowdsourcing","282551801_Incentive_Mechanisms_for_Time_Window_Dependent_Tasks_in_Mobile_Crowdsensing","270906542_Combining_Language_and_Vision_with_a_Multimodal_Skip-gram_Model","257882504_Distributed_Representations_of_Words_and_Phrases_and_their_Compositionality","254464487_Crowdsourcing_to_smartphones_Incentive_mechanism_design_for_mobile_phone_sensing","234131319_Efficient_Estimation_of_Word_Representations_in_Vector_Space","3593605_Primal-dual_RNC_approximation_algorithms_for_set_cover_and_covering_integer_programs","328375597_Non-Interactive_Privacy-Preserving_Truth_Discovery_in_Crowd_Sensing_Applications","326849176_Personalized_Privacy-Preserving_Task_Allocation_for_Mobile_Crowdsensing","326769608_Privacy-Preserving_Crowd-Sourced_Statistical_Data_Publishing_with_An_Untrusted_Server","314201574_On_Designing_Data_Quality-Aware_Truth_Estimation_and_Surplus_Sharing_Method_for_Mobile_Crowdsensing","313100149_Optimal_auction_design","309914426_ITEM2VEC_Neural_item_embedding_for_collaborative_filtering","308839911_Truthful_incentive_mechanisms_for_crowdsourcing","301286545_C_2_Truthful_Incentive_Mechanism_for_Multiple_Cooperative_Tasks_in_Mobile_Cloud","291286882_DeViSE_A_deep_visual-semantic_embedding_model","276663996_A_Survey_on_Incentive_Techniques_for_Mobile_Crowd_Sensing","276275825_Approval_Voting","269298309_Trac_Truthful_Auction_for_Location-Aware_Collaborative_Sensing_in_Mobile_Crowdsourcing","269298257_How_to_crowdsource_tasks_truthfully_without_sacrificing_utility_Online_incentive_mechanisms_with_budget_constraint","263094128_Robust_Trajectory_Estimation_for_Crowdsourcing-Based_Mobile_Applications","262255657_Beyond_VCG_Frugality_of_Truthful_Mechanisms","261060371_Optimal_Incentive-driven_Design_of_Participatory_Sensing_Systems","260231515_word2vec_Explained_deriving_Mikolov_et_al's_negative-sampling_word-embedding_method","257454840_Fostering_ParticipAction_in_Smart_Cities_A_Geo-Social_CrowdSensing_Platform","241770553_How_Long_to_Wait_Predicting_Bus_Arrival_Time_With_Mobile_Phone_Based_Participatory_Sensing","221653977_A_Density-Based_Algorithm_for_Discovering_Clusters_in_Large_Spatial_Databases_with_Noise","45905816_Predicting_Positive_and_Negative_Links_in_Online_Social_Networks","45900673_Budget_Feasible_Mechanisms"]}
