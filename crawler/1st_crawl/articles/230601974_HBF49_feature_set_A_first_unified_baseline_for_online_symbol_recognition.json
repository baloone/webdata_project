{"id":"230601974_HBF49_feature_set_A_first_unified_baseline_for_online_symbol_recognition","abstract":"As the rise of pen-enabled interfaces is accompanied with an increased number of techniques for recognition of pen-based input, recent trends in symbol recognition show an escalation in systems complexity (number of features, classifiers combination) or the over-specialization of systems to specific datasets or applications. Despite the importance of representation space in feature-based methods, few works focus on the design of feature sets adapted to a large variety of symbols, and no universal representation space was proposed as a benchmarking reference. We introduce in this work HBF49, a unique set of features for the representation of hand-drawn symbols to be used as a reference for evaluation of symbol recognition systems. An empirical constructive approach is adopted for designing this set of 49 simple features, able to handle a large diversity of symbols in various experimental contexts. An original effort is made for guaranteeing transparency of features design and reproducibility of experiments. We demonstrate that using off-the-shelf statistical classifiers, the HBF49 representation performs comparably or better than state-of-the-art results reported on eight databases of hand-drawn objects. We also obtain a good recognition performance for user-defined gestures that further attests the ability of HBF49 to deal with a great variety of symbols.","authors":["Adrien Delaye","Eric Anquetil"],"meta":["January 2012Pattern Recognition 46(1):-","DOI:10.1016/j.patcog.2012.07.015"],"references":["267370603_Hidden_Markov_Model_Symbol_Recognition_for_Sketch-Based_Interfaces","265279041_Definitions_for_Features_used_in_Online_Pen_Gesture_Recognition","261333844_The_ILGDB_database_of_realistic_pen-based_gestural_commands","261313552_Competitive_Hybrid_Exploration_for_Off-Line_Sketches_Structure_Recognition","252057205_Online_Japanese_Character_Recognition_Using_Trajectory-Based_Normalization_and_Direction_Feature_Extraction","239762658_Optimization_Analysis_Based_On_A_Breadth-First_Exploration_For_A_Structural_Approach_Of_Sketches_Interpretation","232262651_CASIA_Online_and_Offline_Chinese_Handwriting_Databases","228992049_What_no_Rubine_features_using_geometric-based_features_to_produce_normalized_confidence_values_for_sketch_recognition","228901393_A_Template_Matching_Distance_for_Recognition_of_On-Line_Mathematical_Symbols","228880473_Online_mathematical_symbol_recognition_using_svms_with_features_from_functional_approximation","228664054_The_NicIcon_Database_of_Handwritten_Icons_for_Crisis_Management","226843759_The_state_of_the_art_in_Japanese_online_handwriting_recognition_compared_to_techniques_in_western_handwriting_recognition","225452295_Design_Issues_for_Pen-Centric_Interactive_Maps","224626482_IAM-OnDB_-_An_on-line_English_sentence_database_acquired_from_handwritten_text_on_a_whiteboard","224265598_Fuzzy_Relative_Positioning_Templates_for_Symbol_Recognition","222834590_Handwritten_digit_recognition_Benchmarking_of_state-of-the-art_techniques","222232867_An_image-based_trainable_symbol_recognizer_for_hand-drawn_sketches","221900777_The_WEKA_data_mining_software_An_update","221607832_HMM-Based_Efficient_Sketch_Recognition_1","220929385_Automatic_Adjacency_Grammar_Generation_from_User_Drawn_Sketches","220861161_A_Generic_Hybrid_Classifier_Based_on_Hierarchical_Fuzzy_Modeling_Experiments_on_On-Line_Handwritten_Character_Recognition","220772344_A_Combinatorial_Approach_to_Multi-Domain_Sketch_Recognition","313748448_Recognizing_multistroke_geometric_shapes_An_experimental_evaluation","313645872_An_efficient_algorithm_for_determining_the_convex_hull_of_a_finite_planar_set","307881957_LIBSVM_A_library_for_support_vector_machines","283921280_Visual_Pattern_Recognition_by_Moment_Invariants","272623654_Libsvm","264953104_Character_Recognition_Systems_A_Guide_for_Students_and_Practioners","256181708_Graham_RL_An_Efficient_Algorithm_for_Determining_the_Convex_Hull_of_a_Finite_Planar_Set_Information_Processing_Letters_1_132-133","228715647_LIBSVM_A_library_for_support_vector_machines","224599610_Online_Recognition_of_Multi-Stroke_Symbols_with_Orthogonal_Series","223160224_LADDER_a_sketching_language_for_user_interface_developers","222821075_Directional_features_in_online_handwriting_recognition","222814230_On-line_handwritten_digit_recognition_based_on_trajectory_and_velocity_modeling","222667964_Combining_geometry_and_domain_knowledge_to_interpret_hand-drawn_diagrams","222560509_Iconic_and_multi-stroke_gesture_recognition","222530037_Template-based_online_character_recognition","222399004_Eager_interpretation_of_on-line_hand-drawn_structured_documents_The_DALI_methodology","222197679_A_new_feature_extraction_technique_for_on-line_recognition_of_handwritten_alphanumeric_characters","221617782_Learning_from_Neighboring_Strokes_Combining_Appearance_and_Context_for_Multi-Domain_Sketch_Recognition","221518538_Protractor_a_fast_and_accurate_gesture_recognizer","221514237_Experimental_analysis_of_touch-screen_gesture_designs_in_mobile_environments","221474663_A_Lightweight_Multistroke_Recognizer_for_User_Interface_Prototypes","221389444_Zoning_Methods_for_Hand-Written_Character_Recognition_An_Overview","220877485_Recognizing_Multistroke_Geometric_Shapes_An_Experimental_Evaluation","220876948_Gestures_without_libraries_toolkits_or_training_A_1_recognizer_for_user_interface_prototypes","220860072_A_Non-Rigid_Feature_Extraction_Method_for_Shape_Recognition","220812043_A_Visual_Approach_to_Sketched_Symbol_Recognition","220720539_Specifying_gestures_by_example","220599040_Sketch_recognition_by_fusion_of_temporal_and_image-based_features","220182032_HMM_Based_On-Line_Handwriting_Recognition","215990408_The_WEKA_data_mining_software_An_update","50926820_Evolving_Fuzzy_Classifiers_Application_to_Incremental_Learning_of_Handwritten_Gesture_Recognition_Systems","220291084_Recognizing_sketched_multistroke_primitives","220252535_An_efficient_graph-based_recognizer_for_hand-drawn_symbols"]}
