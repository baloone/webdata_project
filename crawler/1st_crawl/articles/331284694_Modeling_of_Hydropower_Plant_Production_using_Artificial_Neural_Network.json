{"id":"331284694_Modeling_of_Hydropower_Plant_Production_using_Artificial_Neural_Network","abstract":"A new prediction modelling approach for hydropower generation in the presence of input random variables is investigated in this paper. Firstly, they decomposed the annual input variables like the net head of the turbine, and flow rate of water into a certain number of detail signals through artificial neural network (ANN) transform. ANN model used to predict the annual power generation. After the stationary simulation prediction model is obtained, the prediction results were superposed. Finally, simulation results have demonstrated the robustness and effectiveness of this new approach when compared with the existing one.","authors":["Ali Thaeer Hammid","Mohd Herwan Sulaiman","Ali abdulrazzak Jasim"],"meta":["May 2018Journal of Advanced Research in Dynamical and Control Systems 10(10-Special Issue,):1526-1539","Project: Optimization and Control of Hydro Generation Scheduling using Hybrid Firefly Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization Techniques"],"references":["322265995_Optimum_Power_Production_of_Small_Hydropower_Plant_SHP_using_Firefly_Algorithm_FA_in_Himreen_Lake_Dam_HLD_Eastern_Iraq","320997375_Neural_network_with_deep_learning_architectures","319964959_Development_of_an_ultrasonic_weld_inspection_system_based_on_image_processing_and_neural_networks","315908006_Present_and_Future_for_Hydropower_Developments_in_Kurdistan","312151223_Prediction_of_small_hydropower_plant_power_production_in_Himreen_Lake_dam_HLD_using_artificial_neural_network","311936984_Load_Frequency_Control_for_Hydropower_Plants_using_PID_Controller","310800753_Direct_on_Line_Starter_Motor_and_Reverse_System_in_Allen-Bradley_PLC","309196839_Sapropel-based_supports_as_novel_macroporous_carbon-mineral_adsorbents_for_enzymatic_active_substances","306067658_Grey_Wolf_Optimizer_Algorithm_Based_Fuzzy_PID_Controller_for_AGC_of_Multi-area_Power_System_with_TCPS","299865173_Applications_of_Tuning_Control_Actions_for_the_Efficient_Loadfrequency_Control_in_Steam_Turbine","298847618_Design_Remote_Power_Control_IO_Data_Acquisition_System_and_Control_on_Home_Automation","295241772_Short-term_Bulk_Energy_Storage_System_Scheduling_for_Load_Leveling_in_Unit_Commitment_Modeling_Optimization_and_Sensitivity_Analysis","284227453_PLC_-_HMI_Automation_Based_Cascaded_Fuzzy_PID_for_Efficient_Energy_Management_and_Storage_in_Real_Time_Performance_of_a_Hydro_Electric_Pumped_Storage_Power_Plant","273836827_Prediction_of_expansion_behavior_of_self-stressing_concrete_by_artificial_neural_networks_and_fuzzy_inference_systems","271950130_Artificial_Neural_Network_Based_Approach_for_Anti-islanding_Protection_of_Distributed_Generators","261475917_Modeling_of_daily_pan_evaporation_in_sub_tropical_climates_using_ANN_LS-SVR_fuzzy_logic_and_ANFIS","322267993_Real-time_estimation_of_lesion_depth_and_control_of_radiofrequency_ablation_within_ex_vivo_animal_tissues_using_a_neural_network","316781821_Spatial_interpolation_and_radiological_mapping_of_ambient_gamma_dose_rate_by_using_artificial_neural_networks_and_fuzzy_logic_methods","316562809_Flexible_memristor_based_neuromorphic_system_for_implementing_multi-layer_neural_network_algorithms","315977760_Extended_Fuzzy_Hyperline-Segment_Neural_Network_with_Classification_Rule_Extraction","315417631_Takagi-Sugeno_fuzzy_modeling_for_three-phase_micro_hydropower_plant_prototype","313267566_Bayesian_Zero-order_TSK_Fuzzy_System_Modeling","311271978_Performance_analysis_of_descriptive_statistical_features_in_retinal_vessel_segmentation_via_fuzzy_logic_ANN_SVM_and_classifier_fusion","305452495_Robust_Takagi-Sugeno_fuzzy_control_for_fractional_order_hydro-turbine_governing_system","283126816_Biological_image_classification_using_rough-fuzzy_artificial_neural_network","282629228_Segmentation_of_cancerous_regions_in_liver_using_an_edge-based_and_phase_congruent_region_enhancement_method","281873958_Hybrid_Neuro_Fuzzy_approach_for_automatic_generation_control_in_restructured_power_system","277818553_Prediction_of_subsidence_risk_by_FMEA_using_artificial_neural_network_and_fuzzy_inference_system","257810346_Artificial_Neural_Network_Model_of_Discharge_Lamps_in_the_Power_Quality_Context","251509289_Fuzzy_rule-based_model_for_hydropower_reservoirs_operation","223725911_Generation_planning_in_Iranian_power_plants_with_fuzzy_hierarchical_production_planning","223718393_Short-Term_and_Long-Term_Streamflow_Forecasting_Using_a_Wavelet_and_Neuro-Fuzzy_Conjunction_Model","223259105_Short-term_water_level_prediction_using_neural_networks_and_neuro-fuzzy_approach","222149807_Modeling_daily_discharge_responses_of_a_large_karstic_aquifer_using_soft_computing_methods_Artificial_neural_network_and_neuro-fuzzy","222008714_Suspended_Sediment_Concentration_Estimation_by_an_Adaptive_Neuro-Fuzzy_and_Neural_Network_Approaches_Using_Hydro-Meteorological_Data","220199575_Zero-order_TS_fuzzy_model_to_predict_hydro_turbine_speed_in_closed_loop_operation"]}
