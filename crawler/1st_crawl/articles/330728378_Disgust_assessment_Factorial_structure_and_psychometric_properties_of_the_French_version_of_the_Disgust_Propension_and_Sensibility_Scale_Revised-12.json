{"id":"330728378_Disgust_assessment_Factorial_structure_and_psychometric_properties_of_the_French_version_of_the_Disgust_Propension_and_Sensibility_Scale_Revised-12","abstract":"The present study examined the internal and external validity of the French version of the 12-item Disgust Propensity and Sensitivity Scale-Revised (DPSS-12) in a nonclinical sample from the general population. Two hundred and eighty-two participants completed the DPSSf-12 questionnaire as well as the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI), Anxiety Trait (STAI B), Obsessional Belief Questionnaire 44 items (OBQ 44), Obsessive Compulsive Inventory-Revised (OCI-R) and Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). Confirmatory Factor Analysis supported a 2-factor structure after two sensitivity items were removed. The 10-item scale showed good internal consistency, construct validity and test-retest reliability. These adequate psychometric properties make the DPSSf-10 appropriate for use by researchers and practitioners.","authors":["Caroline Novara","Julie Boiché 1☯","Cindy Lebrun","Alexandra Macgregor"],"meta":["January 2019PLoS ONE 14(1)","DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0210639"],"references":["316981419_Validating_the_Italian_Version_of_the_Disgust_and_Propensity_Scale-Revised","309037230_Factor_Structure_Reliability_and_Validity_of_the_Japanese_Version_of_the_Disgust_Propensity_and_Sensitivity_Scale-Revised","327650264_Obsessive-Compulsive_Disorder_Theory_Research_and_Treatment","309311042_Does_the_Measure_Matter_On_the_Association_between_Disgust_Proneness_and_OCD_Symptoms","301345318_Measurement_of_Disgust_Proneness","296966014_The_developmental_functions_of_emotions_An_analysis_in_terms_of_differential_emotions_theory","293143380_Disgust_and_its_disorders_Theory_assessment_and_treatment","290196629_Convergence_in_feeling_divergence_in_physiology_How_culture_influences_the_consequences_of_disgust_suppression_and_amplification_among_European_Americans_and_Asian_Americans","284655519_Disgust_in_Handbook_of_Emotions","274015857_Team_RDCR_A_Language_And_Environment_For_Statistical_Computing_R_Foundation_for_Statistical_Computing_Vienna_Austria"]}
