Specifically, how ways of doing/being/knowing (ethico-onto-epistemology) literacies are produced through intra-actions of humans and nonhumans. A second aim is to demonstrate how theory(ies) shape inquiry, how we write up transcripts and do analysis. The author puts to work data of students constructing paper Robin Hood hats to demonstrate how a dominant perspective in literacy education, New Literacy Studies (NLS), is not adequate when conceptualizing literacy as rhizomatic and intra-active. The author demonstrates analysis and discusses how these theories are paradigmatically different from NLS, a human-centered ontology. The author encourages educators to consider inventive ways of researching/teaching with ‘more than human ontologies’ and the ethics of doing so.","authors":["Candace R.
