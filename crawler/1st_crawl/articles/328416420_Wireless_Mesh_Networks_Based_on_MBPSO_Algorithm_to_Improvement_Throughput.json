{"id":"328416420_Wireless_Mesh_Networks_Based_on_MBPSO_Algorithm_to_Improvement_Throughput","abstract":"Wireless Mesh Networks can be regarded as a type of communication technology in mesh topology in which wireless nodes interconnect with one another. Wireless Mesh Networks depending on the semi-static configuration in different paths among nodes such as PDR, E2E delay and throughput. This study summarized different types of previous heuristic algorithms in order to adapt with proper algorithm that could solve the issue. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to determine the proper methods, approaches or algorithms that should be adapted to improve the throughput. A Modified Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (MBPSO) approach was adapted to improvements the throughput. Finally, the finding shows that throughput increased by 5.79% from the previous study.
