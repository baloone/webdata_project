{"id":"340007463_Graph_Laplacian_for_Spectral_Clustering_and_Seeded_Image_Segmentation","abstract":"Interactive segmentation methods have gained much attention lately, specially due to their good performance in segmenting complex images and easy utilization. However, most interactive segmentation algorithms rely on sophisticated mathematical formulations whose effectiveness highly depends on the kind of image to be processed. In fact, sharp adherence to the contours of image segments, uniqueness of solution, high computational burden, and extensive user interaction are some of the weaknesses of most existing methods. In this thesis we proposed two novel interactive image segmentation techniques that sort out the issues raised above. The proposed methods rely on Laplace operators, spectral graph theory, and optimization schemes towards enabling highly accurate segmentation tools which demand a reduced amount of user interaction while still being mathematically simple and computationally efficient. The good performance of our segmentation algorithms is attested by a comprehensive set of comparisons against representative state-of-the-art methods. As additional contribution, we have also proposed two new algorithms for inpainting and photo colorization, both of which rely on the accuracy of our segmentation apparatus","authors":["Wallace Casaca","Gabriel Taubin","Luis Gustavo Nonato"],"meta":["February 2020","DOI:10.5753/ctd.2015.9998","Conference: XXVIII Concurso de Teses e Dissertações da SBC"],"references":[]}
