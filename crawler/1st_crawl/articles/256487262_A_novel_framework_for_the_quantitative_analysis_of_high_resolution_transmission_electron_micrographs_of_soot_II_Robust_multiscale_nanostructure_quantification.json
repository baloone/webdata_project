{"id":"256487262_A_novel_framework_for_the_quantitative_analysis_of_high_resolution_transmission_electron_micrographs_of_soot_II_Robust_multiscale_nanostructure_quantification","abstract":"The quantitative characterization of mostly amorphous soot structures is a difficult problem. High resolution electron microscopy is a tool capable of providing structural information related to the crystalline order in soot; however, well-defined and exhaustive structural parameters are needed for quantification. The typical observable field of view and the insufficient amount of structural information extractable from a single electron micrograph pose another problem in obtaining reliable statistical description. This paper has two objectives: first, to show that the already developed and published structural descriptors can be united by introducing a general model for the characterization of molecular order and second, to extend the general filtering approach presented in Part I of this study to allow for the efficient extraction of such general parameters. The computational background is described with automatic, real-time future applications in mind.","authors":["P. Toth","Arpad B Palotas","Eric G.
