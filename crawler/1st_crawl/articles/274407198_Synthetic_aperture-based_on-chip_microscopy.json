{"id":"274407198_Synthetic_aperture-based_on-chip_microscopy","abstract":"Wide field-of-view (FOV) and high-resolution imaging requires microscopy modalities to have large space-bandwidth products. Lensfree on-chip microscopy decouples resolution from FOV and can achieve a space-bandwidth product greater than one billion under unit magnification using state-of-the-art opto-electronic sensor chips and pixel super-resolution techniques. However, using vertical illumination, the effective numerical aperture (NA) that can be achieved with an on-chip microscope is limited by a poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at high spatial frequencies and imaging artifacts that arise as a result of the relatively narrow acceptance angles of the sensor's pixels. Here, we report, for the first time, a synthetic aperture-based on-chip microscope in which the illumination angle is scanned across the surface of a dome to increase the effective NA of the reconstructed lensfree image to 1.4, achieving e.g., ~250-nm resolution at 700-nm wavelength under unit magnification. This synthetic aperture approach not only represents the largest NA achieved to date using an on-chip microscope but also enables color imaging of connected tissue samples, such as pathology slides, by achieving robust phase recovery without the need for multi-height scanning or any prior information about the sample. To validate the effectiveness of this synthetic aperture-based, partially coherent, holographic on-chip microscope, we have successfully imaged color-stained cancer tissue slides as well as unstained Papanicolaou smears across a very large FOV of 20.5 mm2. This compact on-chip microscope based on a synthetic aperture approach could be useful for various applications in medicine, physical sciences and engineering that demand high-resolution wide-field imaging.","authors":["Wei Luo","Alon Greenbaum","Yibo Zhang","Aydogan Ozcan"],"meta":["March 2015Light: Science & Applications 4(3)","DOI:10.1038/lsa.2015.34"],"references":["263710611_Multiplexed_coded_illumination_for_Fourier_Ptychography_with_an_LED_array_microscope","260206053_Corrigendum_Wide-field_high-resolution_Fourier_ptychographic_microscopy","248389897_Interferometric_Synthetic_Aperture_Microscopy","247212679_Reconstruction_of_a_complex-valued_object_from_the_modulus_of_its_Fourier_transform_using_a_support_constraint","286323040_Optical_Imaging_and_Spectroscopy","269766726_Wide-field_computational_imaging_of_pathology_slides_using_lens-free_on-chip_microscopy","261205053_Interferometric_Synthetic_Aperture_Microscopy","259396238_Wide-field_optical_detection_of_nanoparticles_using_on-chip_microscopy_and_self-assembled_nanolenses","243632401_Woods_RE_Digital_Image_Processing","239654115_Phase_contrast_a_New_Method_for_the_Microscopic_Observation_of_Transparent_Objects"]}
