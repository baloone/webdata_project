{"id":"342528886_About_some_possibilities_of_diagnosing_partial_failures_arising_in_complex_agricultural_machinery","abstract":"The article is devoted to the issue of partial failure in complex technical systems. The authors analyze the diagnostic procedure in agricultural machinery for various purposes, the results of which provide a diagram of a multi-level organization for assessing the condition of equipment. It is also proposed to expand the range of estimated diagnostic parameters for making a more reliable managerial decision. The introduction of expert systems and other similar intelligent systems (for example, expert decision support systems) for diagnosing complex malfunctions is justified.","authors":["Alexy Zotov","Vadim Gritsenko","Andrey Gazizov"],"meta":["January 2020E3S Web of Conferences 175:05004","DOI:10.1051/e3sconf/202017505004"],"references":["339608688_Decision_support_systems_for_agriculture_40_Survey_and_challenges","331470694_A_Survey_of_Semantic_Web_Technology_for_Agriculture","326139893_Transition_towards_sustainability_in_agriculture_and_food_systems_Role_of_information_and_communication_technologies","309323011_Toward_a_new_generation_of_agricultural_system_data_models_and_knowledge_products_State_of_agricultural_systems_science","330056012_Cost_of_Using_Agricultural_Machinery","327608911_The_Research_of_Machinery_Fault_Feature_Extraction_Methods_Based_On_Vibration_Signal","288020733_A_Human-Centred_approach_to_e-Agricultural_systems","271479095_Design_Considerations_for_ISOBUS_Class_3_Machinery_Systems_Human-Machine_Interaction","264791116_Advances_in_agricultural_machinery_management_A_review","257404047_Effectiveness_assessment_of_agricultural_machinery_based_on_fuzzy_sets_theory"]}
