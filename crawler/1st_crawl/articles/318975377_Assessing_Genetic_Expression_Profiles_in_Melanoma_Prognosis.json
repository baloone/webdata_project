{"id":"318975377_Assessing_Genetic_Expression_Profiles_in_Melanoma_Prognosis","abstract":"A 31-genetic expression profile (31-GEP) test (DecisionDx-Melanoma, Castle Biosciences Inc, Friendswood, TX, USA) was developed as a diagnostic test to assist physicians in the management of cutaneous malignant melanoma. Based on a patient's primary tumor expression levels of a panel of genes (28 discriminating genes and 3 control genes), a lesion is classified as \"low risk\" (class 1) or \"high risk\" (class 2) for metastasis. Studies evaluating the clinical utility and impact of the 31-GEP test showed it positively influenced clinical management and patient care, as clinicians incorporated the additional data to modify their clinical recommendations in a risk-appropriate manner.","authors":["Aaron S.
