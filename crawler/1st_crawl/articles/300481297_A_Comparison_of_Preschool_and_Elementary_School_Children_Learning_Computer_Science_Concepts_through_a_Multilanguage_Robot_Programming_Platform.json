{"id":"300481297_A_Comparison_of_Preschool_and_Elementary_School_Children_Learning_Computer_Science_Concepts_through_a_Multilanguage_Robot_Programming_Platform","abstract":"This paper describes a school intervention to teach fundamental Computer Science (CS) concepts to 3-11 year old students with a multilanguage robot programming platform (using drag and drop, Python and C++ languages) in Argentina. We analyze students' performance and learning process based on multiple choice test and classroom observations. Data show that all students can intuitively learn sequence, conditional, loops and parameters and that girls performed slightly better than boys. Older students can easily combine these concepts to write a program. The multilanguage platform promotes student spontaneous exploration of more sophisticated CS concepts and languages. These findings imply that introducing CS in mandatory schooling from an inquiry based approach is both achievable and beneficial.","authors":["Cecilia Martinez","Marcos Javier GÃ³mez","Luciana Benotti"],"meta":["June 2015","DOI:10.1145/2729094.2742599","Conference: the 2015 ACM Conference"],"references":["279892528_Preschool_cookbook_of_computer_programming_topics","265057927_Students'_performance_on_programming-related_tasks_in_an_informatics_contest_in_Finland_Sweden_and_Lithuania","311262146_Hour_of_Code_We_can_solve_the_diversity_problem_in_computer_science","286873961_The_TangibleK_robotics_program_Applied_computational_thinking_for_young_children","271938069_Let's_Dance_the_Robot_Hokey-Pokey","266656929_Teaching_a_core_CS_concept_through_robotics","266653631_Alice_31_abstract_only","262253499_Designing_ScratchJr_support_for_early_childhood_learning_through_computer_programming","262158859_A_large-scale_quantitative_study_of_women_in_computer_science_at_Stanford_University","261594870_Technology_in_the_Classroom_Learning_in_the_Robotic_World_Active_or_Reactive"]}
