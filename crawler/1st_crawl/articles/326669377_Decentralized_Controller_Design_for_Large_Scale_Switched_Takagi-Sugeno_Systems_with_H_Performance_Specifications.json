{"id":"326669377_Decentralized_Controller_Design_for_Large_Scale_Switched_Takagi-Sugeno_Systems_with_H_Performance_Specifications","abstract":"This paper investigates the design of decentralized controllers for a class of large scale switched nonlinear systems under arbitrary switching laws. A global large scale switched system can be split into a set of smaller interconnected switched Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy subsystems. In this context, to stabilize the overall closed-loop system, a set of switched non-Parallel-Distributed-Compensation (non-PDC) output-feedback controllers is considered. The latter is designed based on Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMI) conditions obtained from a multiple switched non-quadratic Lyapunov-like candidate function. The controllers proposed herein are synthesized to satisfy H∞ performances for disturbance attenuation. Finally, a numerical example is proposed to illustrate the effectiveness of the suggested decentralized switched controller design approach.\n\nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.","authors":["Dalel Jabri","D.E.C Belkhiat","Kevin Guelton","Noureddine Manamanni"],"meta":["July 2018Journal of Advanced Engineering and Computation 2(2):139","DOI:10.25073/jaec.201822.187","Projects: Identification and monitoring of complex systems: cross flow heat exchangers.
