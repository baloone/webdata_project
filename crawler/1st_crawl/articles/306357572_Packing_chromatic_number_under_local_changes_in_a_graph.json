{"id":"306357572_Packing_chromatic_number_under_local_changes_in_a_graph","abstract":"The packing chromatic number $\\chi_{\\rho}(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the smallest integer $k$ such that there exists a $k$-vertex coloring of $G$ in which any two vertices receiving color $i$ are at distance at least $i+1$. It is proved that in the class of subcubic graphs the packing chromatic number is bigger than $13$, thus answering an open problem from [Gastineau, Togni, $S$-packing colorings of cubic graphs, Discrete Math.\\ 339 (2016) 2461--2470]. In addition, the packing chromatic number is investigated with respect to several local operations. In particular, if $S_e(G)$ is the graph obtained from a graph $G$ by subdividing its edge $e$, then $\\left\\lfloor \\chi_{\\rho}(G)/2 \\right\\rfloor +1 \\le \\chi_{\\rho}(S_e(G)) \\le \\chi_{\\rho}(G)+1$.","authors":["Boštjan Brešar,","Sandi Klavžar","Douglas F.
