{"id":"346829464_Self-Regulated_Learning_in_Flipped_Classrooms_A_Systematic_Literature_Review","abstract":"The flipped classroom is considered an instructional strategy and a type of blended learning instruction that focused on active learning and student engagement. Over the years, flipped classroom studies have focused more on the advantages and challenges of flipped instruction and its effectiveness, but little is known about the state of self-regulation in flipped classrooms. This study investigates the self-regulation strategies as well as the supports proposed for self-regulated learning in flipped classrooms. Findings show that relatively few studies have focused on self-regulated learning in flipped classrooms compared to the overall research and publication productivity in flipped classrooms. Also, the existing solutions and supports have only focused on either self-regulation or online help-seeking, but have not focused on other specific types of self-regulation strategies. Our study proposed some future research recommendations in flipped classrooms.","authors":["Rasheed Abubakar Rasheed","Amirrudin Kamsin","Nor Aniza Abdullah","Habeebah Kakudi"],"meta":["January 2020International Journal of Information and Education Technology 10(11):848-853","DOI:10.18178/ijiet.2020.10.11.1469"],"references":["331337478_Predictive_power_of_regularity_of_pre-class_activities_in_a_flipped_classroom","344538008_The_Flipped_Classroom_A_Survey_of_the_Research","340450141_Students_and_teachers'_challenges_of_using_technology_in_blended_learning_environments","335822923_Challenges_in_the_online_component_of_blended_learning_A_systematic_review","335086083_On_the_relationships_between_behaviors_and_achievement_in_technology-mediated_flipped_classrooms_A_two-phase_online_behavioral_PLS-SEM_model","333937350_How_the_flipped_classroom_affects_knowledge_skills_and_engagement_in_higher_education_Effects_on_students'_satisfaction","333177286_A_latent_profile_analysis_of_adult_students'_online_self-regulation_in_blended_learning_environments","330340958_Nursing_students_studying_physiology_within_a_flipped_classroom_self-regulation_and_off-campus_activities","328834916_The_Relationships_among_Gender_Cognitive_Styles_Learning_Strategies_and_Learning_Performance_in_the_Flipped_Classroom","328557055_Using_game-based_negotiation_mechanism_to_enhance_students'_goal_setting_and_regulation"]}
