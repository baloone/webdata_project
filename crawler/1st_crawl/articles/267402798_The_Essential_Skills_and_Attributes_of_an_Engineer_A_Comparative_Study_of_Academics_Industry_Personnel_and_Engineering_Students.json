{"id":"267402798_The_Essential_Skills_and_Attributes_of_an_Engineer_A_Comparative_Study_of_Academics_Industry_Personnel_and_Engineering_Students","abstract":"This paper presents the results of a survey administered to academics, industry personnel and students with the objective of eliciting their views on what the essential generic and specialist skills and attributes are for a modern engineer. Statistical analysis of the survey results clearly indicates that engineering curricula need to be revised; universities must make provision for engineering subjects, teaching and learning material which are updated and capable of enhancing the skills and attributes of future engineers to meet the changing global environment. The quality of future engi-neers depends very much on the quality of engineering education, which is itself dependent upon developments in engineering curricula.","authors":["Duyen Q Nguyen"],"meta":["January 1998Global Journal of Engineering Education 2"],"references":[]}
