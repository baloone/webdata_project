{"id":"262641249_Interaction_Graphs_Graphings","abstract":"In two previous papers, we exposed a combinatorial approach to the program of\nGeometry of Interaction, a program initiated by Jean-Yves Girard. The strength\nof our approach lies in the fact that we interpret proofs by simpler structures\n- graphs - than Girard's constructions, while generalizing the latter since\nthey can be recovered as special cases of our setting. This third paper extends\nthis approach by considering a generalization of graphs named graphings, which\nis in some way a geometric realization of a graph. This very general framework\nleads to a number of new models of multiplicative-additive linear logic which\ngeneralize Girard's geometry of interaction models and opens several new lines\nof research. As an example, we exhibit a family of such models which account\nfor second-order quantification without suffering the same limitations as\nGirard's models.","authors":["Thomas Seiller"],"meta":["February 2017Annals of Pure and Applied Logic 168(2):278-320","DOI:10.1016/j.apal.2016.10.007","SourcearXiv"],"references":["275753152_Interaction_Graphs_and_Complexity","220997121_The_Geometry_of_Optimal_Lambda_Reduction","220727487_Elementary_Complexity_and_Geometry_of_Interaction","220700635_Multiport_Interaction_Nets_and_Concurrency","2407467_Elementary_Complexity_and_Geometry_of_Interaction","312914545_Geometry_of_interaction_II_deadlock-free_algorithms","309093236_Unary_Resolution_Characterizing_Ptime","302900160_On_the_computational_meaning_of_axioms","282634574_Transcendental_syntax_I_deterministic_case","275054680_Interaction_Graphs_Full_Linear_Logic","268165231_Towards_a_Geometry_of_Interaction","267669851_Les_groupes_de_transformations_continus_infinis_simples","267013784_Spaces_with_measurable_diagonal","266718782_Multiplicatives","264673883_A_Correspondence_between_Maximal_Abelian_Sub-Algebras_and_Linear_Logic_Fragments","259654699_Logique_dans_le_Facteur_Hyperfini_Geometrie_de_l'Interaction_et_Complexite","259106322_Interaction_Graphs_Exponentials","256844830_Foundations_of_Differential_Geometry_Vol_II","246318662_Geometry_of_Interaction_IV_the_Feedback_Equation","245899987_Determinant_Theory_in_Finite_Factors","240019700_Geometry_of_interaction_I_an_interpretation_of_system_f","238327459_Sur_la_structure_des_groupes_in_nis_de_transformations","234119561_Logarithmic_Space_and_Permutations","231942337_Trees_and_amenable_equivalence_relations","231759642_On_the_cost_of_generating_an_equivalence_relation","230859113_Characterizing_co-NL_by_a_group_action","226457878_Cout_des_relations_d'equivalence_et_des_groupes","225075038_Interaction_Graphs_Multiplicatives","225075037_Interaction_Graphs_Additives","221942985_Linear_Logic","221318468_Geometry_of_interaction_2_Deadlock-free_algorithms","220997608_An_Algorithm_for_Optimal_Lambda_Calculus_Reduction","220149805_Geometry_of_Interaction_V_Logic_in_the_hyperfinite_factor","46417135_Realizability_in_classical_logic","34620033_Sur_la_structure_des_groupes_de_transformations_finis_et_continus_microform","4350450_The_Geometry_of_Interaction_of_Differential_Interaction_Nets","4263844_Strong_Normalization_as_Safe_Interaction","2507504_Linear_Logic_Its_Syntax_And_Semantics","2506631_Typed_lambda-calculus_in_classical_Zermelo-Fraenkel_set_theory","2418776_Geometry_Of_Interaction_III_Accommodating_The_Additives","1958270_The_Geometry_of_Linear_Higher-Order_Recursion"]}
