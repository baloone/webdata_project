{"id":"336899027_A_lexicographic_pricer_for_the_fractional_bin_packing_problem","abstract":"We propose an exact lexicographic dynamic programming pricing algorithm for solving the Fractional Bin Packing Problem with column generation. The new algorithm is designed for generating maximal columns of minimum reduced cost which maximize, lexicographically, one of the measures of maximality we investigate. Extensive computational experiments reveal that a column generation\nalgorithm based on this pricing technique can achieve a substantial reduction in number of columns and computing time, also when combined with a classical smoothing technique from the literature.","authors":["Stefano Coniglio","Fabio D'Andreagiovanni","Fabio Furini"],"meta":["October 2019Operations Research Letters 47(6)","DOI:10.1016/j.orl.2019.10.011"],"references":["315920099_An_Effective_Dynamic_Programming_Algorithm_for_the_Minimum-Cost_Maximal_Knapsack_Packing_Problem","269696464_Automation_and_Combination_of_Linear-Programming_Based_Stabilization_Techniques_in_Column_Generation","263070332_Friendly_Bin_Packing_Instances_without_Integer_Round-up_Property","336977807_A_New_Branch-and-Price-and-Cut_Algorithm_for_One-Dimensional_Bin-Packing_Problems","325427234_Theoretical_challenges_towards_cutting-plane_selection","301742582_Bin_Packing_and_Cutting_Stock_Problems_Mathematical_Models_and_Exact_Algorithms","300779613_On_the_Generation_of_Cutting_Planes_which_Maximize_the_Bound_Improvement","281267026_Approximating_polyhedra_with_sparse_inequalities","257479857_Coordinated_cutting_plane_generation_via_multi-objective_separation","244959789_A_New_Lower_Bound_for_the_Bin-Packing_Problem_and_Its_Integration_Into_MTP"]}
