{"id":"284834545_Engineering_of_web_services_for_internet_of_things_applications","abstract":"This paper addresses web services for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. The research focus is on IoT applications for mobile monitoring and third party’s database access. Both web services design aspects and deployment issues are studied. By synthesis of functional abstraction for configuration management and performance monitoring, an approach to design RESTful web services for mobile monitoring is suggested. In addition to traditional operations supported by Database Management Systems, web services’ operations for subscription management and notifications about occurrences of specific data-related events, as well as operations for trust and security management are proposed in the context of third party’s database access. Web services deployment issues concern the access control aimed to prevent from overloading. A formal method for a model-based load evaluation of SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) application server is suggested. The method takes into account the distributed server architecture and the processing of heterogeneous traffic. The SOA application server’s utilization is evaluated by simulation.","authors":["Evelina Pencheva","Ivaylo Atanasov"],"meta":["September 2014Information Systems Frontiers 18(2):1-16","DOI:10.1007/s10796-014-9532-3"],"references":["271921561_The_Internet_of_Things-A_survey_of_topics_and_trends","271658599_The_internet_of_things_A_survey","262056566_An_Integrated_System_for_Regional_Environmental_Monitoring_and_Management_Based_on_Internet_of_Things","262056565_Developing_Vehicular_Data_Cloud_Services_in_the_IoT_Environment","261317910_RESTful_Web_Services_for_High_Speed_Intrusion_Detection_Systems","261024372_Architecture_and_measured_characteristics_of_a_cloud_based_internet_of_things_API","258162889_An_integrated_information_system_for_snowmelt_flood_early-warning_based_on_internet_of_things","257719252_Ubiquitous_Health_Monitoring_Using_Mobile_Web_Services","241709205_Cloud_manufacturing_A_new_manufacturing_paradigm","224250130_Web_services_for_the_Internet_of_Things_through_CoAP_and_EXI","220865865_PRIDE_A_Data_Abstraction_Layer_for_Large-Scale_2-tier_Sensor_Networks","220708821_A_Practical_Application_of_SOA_-_A_Collaborative_Marketplace","220198924_A_framework_for_deriving_semantic_web_services","220066379_From_service_delivery_to_integrated_SOA_based_application_delivery_in_the_telecommunication_industry","51825597_Design_and_Evaluation_of_a_Telemonitoring_Concept_Based_on_NFC-Enabled_Mobile_Phones_and_Sensor_Devices","299790924_Practical_application_of_the_rules","272121073_A_chaos_control_optimal_algorithm_for_QoS-based_service_composition_selection_in_cloud_manufacturing_system","264822557_Towards_a_scalable_mobile_telemetry_system_and_ubiquitous_access_to_measurements","264813112_Service-oriented_simulation_using_web_ontology","263468169_RFID_in_the_warehouse_A_literature_analysis_1995-2010_of_its_applications_benefits_challenges_and_future_trends","262243219_Cloud_services_based_Mobile_monitoring_for_Photovoltaic_Systems","262056564_Ubiquitous_Data_Accessing_Method_in_IoT-Based_Information_System_for_Emergency_Medical_Services","262056563_IoT-Based_Smart_Rehabilitation_System","262056556_QoS-Aware_Scheduling_of_Services-Oriented_Internet_of_Things","262056552_An_IoT-Oriented_Data_Storage_Framework_in_Cloud_Computing_Platform","261957893_BSP-GA_A_new_Genetic_Algorithm_for_System_Optimization_and_Excellent_Schema_Selection","260803494_Bottom-Up_Approach_based_on_Internet_Of_Things_for_Order_Fulfillment_in_a_Collaborative_Warehousing_Environment","257574600_Service-oriented_intelligent_group_decision_support_system_Application_in_transportation_management","257574492_A_new_methodology_to_support_group_decision-making_for_IoT-based_emergency_response_systems","257574477_Value-centric_design_of_the_internet-of-things_solution_for_food_supply_chain_Value_creation_sensor_portfolio_and_information_fusion","238517511_Analysis_on_Database_Connection_Mechanism_of_WEB_Application_System_in_Dreamweaver","224355389_Database_interoperability_through_Web_Services_and_ontologies","224208047_Embedded_Web_Services","224142252_A_framework_for_performance_analysis_of_clientserver_based_SOA_and_P2P_SOA","222544841_Markov_models_of_internet_traffic_and_a_new_hierarchical_MMPP_model","221692020_A_framework_for_the_comparison_of_mobile_patient_monitoring_systems","221567280_On_the_potentials_of_object_group_localization_in_the_Internet_of_Things","221542564_Looking_into_a_REST-Based_Universal_API_for_Database-as-a-Service_Systems","221022052_MASTH_proxy_An_extensible_platform_for_Web_overload_control","44797844_Remote_Health_Monitoring_Using_Mobile_Phones_and_Web_Services","4325444_A_Design_of_Open_Service_Access_Gateway_for_Converged_Web_Service"]}
