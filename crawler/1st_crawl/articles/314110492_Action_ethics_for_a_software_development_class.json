{"id":"314110492_Action_ethics_for_a_software_development_class","abstract":"The integration of ethics into computer science instruction is not a new idea (for example, see [10]), but it is still useful to illustrate how this integration can be done in specific kinds of courses [14]. In this article, we present a hands-on ethics lesson for students involved in programming. We think this exercise can be used in any undergraduate class that engages students in software development. Although our examples are written using JavaScript, and can run in any modern browser, they could be easily adapted to other programming languages and platforms. Our goal in this exercise is to encourage students to think more carefully about the ethical implications of the kinds of work students are likely to be asked to do in their first software development jobs.","authors":["David Larson","Keith Willam Miller"],"meta":["February 2017ACM Inroads 8(1):38-42","DOI:10.1145/3043949"],"references":["256066495_The_ethical_challenges_of_ubiquitous_healthcare","242362942_The_case_of_the_killer_robot","234807384_How_good_is_good_enough_an_ethical_analysis_of_software_construction_and_use","40833934_Monitor_Alarm_Fatigue_Standardizing_Use_of_Physiological_Monitors_and_Decreasing_Nuisance_Alarms","255673748_Introducing_computer_ethics_into_the_computer_science_curriculum","239427344_Engineering_ethics_education_in_the_USA_Content_pedagogy_and_curriculum_European_Journal_of_Engineering_Education_254_303-314","225546675_Debriefing_Experiential_Learning_Exercises_in_Ethics_Education","220376810_Paramedic_ethics_for_computer_professionals","12104144_Legal_ethical_and_risk_issues_in_telemedicine","7169877_On_teaching_computer_ethics_within_a_computer_science_department"]}
