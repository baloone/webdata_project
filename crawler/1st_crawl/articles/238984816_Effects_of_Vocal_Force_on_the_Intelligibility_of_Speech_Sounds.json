{"id":"238984816_Effects_of_Vocal_Force_on_the_Intelligibility_of_Speech_Sounds","abstract":"Measurements were made of the intelligibility of speech heard in noise and produced by different amounts of vocal force. Vocal force ranged from the weakest voiced whisper to a very heavy shout. The results show less than 5% deterioration in intelligibility over the range from a moderately low voice to a very loud voice (55 to 78 db in a free field at one m from the lips). Beyond these points intelligibility decreases abruptly and in a linear relation to decibel change in vocal intensity. Listeners&apos; errors are analyzed to determine the effects of the extremes of vocal force on the intelligibility of different parts of the syllable and of different vowels.","authors":["J. M.
