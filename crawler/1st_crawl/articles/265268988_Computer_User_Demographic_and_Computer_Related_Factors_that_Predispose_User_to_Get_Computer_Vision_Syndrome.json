This study aims to identify sociodemographic and computer related predictors for CVS. Methods: Cross-sectional study and face-to-face interviews and workstation assessment were employed guided by questionnaire. Results: Finding showed that 68.1% reported CVS symptoms. Only 19.3% of the respondents put their computer on computer table and 61.9% took at least 10 minutes rest while on continuous one hour computer work. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the predictors for CVS were Female (OR=2.3), age <27 years old (OR=2.89), use correction spectacle/lenses (OR=1.91), not taking regular rest (OR=1.78) and use computer > 7 hours per day (OR=2.01). Conclusion: Use of correction lenses and long duration on continuous computer work predispose a person to get CVS. Resting their eyes in between continuous computer work will be helpful to reduce possibility to get CVS.","authors":["Zairina a Rahman"],"meta":[],"references":["5783271_Ophthalmologist_and_computer_vision_syndrome","321204448_Impact_of_Computer_Workstation_Design_on_Health_of_the_Users","230754159_Prevalence_of_overuse_injury_among_keyboard_operators_Characteristics_of_the_job_the_operator_and_the_work_environment","228652975_Impact_of_Computer_Workstation_Design_on_Health_Users","26416053_Occupational_overuse_syndrome_among_keyboard_users_in_Mauritius","26310703_Prevalence_of_Work-Related_Upper_Limbs_Symptoms_WRULS_Among_Office_Workers","21131724_Task_Variables_and_Visual_Discomfort_Associated_with_the_Use_of_VDTs","14021969_Vision_screening_eye_examination_and_risk_assessment_of_display_screen_users_in_a_large_regional_teaching_hospital","10760616_The_effect_of_work-rest_schedules_and_type_of_task_on_the_discomfort_and_performance_of_VDT_users","8075495_Survey_on_Visual_and_Musculoskeletal_Symptoms_in_VDT_Workers"]}
