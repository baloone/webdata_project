{"id":"302202728_Combinatorial_Algorithms","abstract":"Many results about representations of the symmetric group can be approached in a purely combinatorial manner. The crucial link between these two viewpoints is the fact (Theorem 2.6.5, part 2) that the number of standard Young tableaux of given shape is the degree of the corresponding representation.","authors":["Bruce E.
