{"id":"291348591_Ontology_for_observations_and_sampling_features_with_alignments_to_existing_models","abstract":"We introduce new OWL ontologies for observations and sampling features, based on the O&M conceptual model from OGC and ISO 19156. Previous efforts, (a) through the W3C SSN project, and (b) following ISO rules for conversion from UML, had dependencies on elaborate pre-existing ontologies and frameworks. The new ontologies, known as om-lite and sam-lite, remove such dependencies, and can therefore be used with minimal ontological commitment beyond the O&M conceptual model. Time and space concepts, for which there are multiple existing solutions, are implemented as stub-classes, and patterns for linking to the existing ontologies are described. PROV is used to support certain requirements for the description of specimens. A more general alignment of both observation and sampling feature ontologies with PROV is described, as well as mappings to some other observation models and ontologies.","authors":["Simon Jonathan David Cox"],"meta":["December 2016Semantic Web 8(3):453-470","DOI:10.3233/SW-160214"],"references":["262936936_ISO_191562011_-_Geographic_information_--_Observations_and_measurements","262936739_An_explicit_OWL_representation_of_ISOOGC_Observations_and_Measurements","260526984_Semantics_in_Support_of_Biodiversity_Knowledge_Discovery_An_Introduction_to_the_Biological_Collections_Ontology_and_Related_Ontologies","256092056_The_SSN_Ontology_of_the_W3C_Semantic_Sensor_Network_Incubator_Group","220866366_A_Comparison_of_Upper_Ontologies","26438454_Data_integration_with_the_Climate_Science_Modelling_Language","291348752_Time_ontology_extended_for_non-Gregorian_calendar_applications","288482935_Sensor_data_provenance_SSNO_and_PROV-O_together_at_last","228749394_The_Stimulus-Sensor-Observation_Ontology_Design_Pattern_and_its_Integration_into_the_Semantic_Sensor_Network_Ontology","223833893_An_ontology_for_describing_and_synthesizing_ecological_observation_data","221118239_A_Stimulus-Centric_Algebraic_Approach_to_Sensors_and_Observations","221101129_SAOR_Authoritative_Reasoning_for_the_Web","220694438_Analysis_Patterns_Reusable_Object_Models"]}
