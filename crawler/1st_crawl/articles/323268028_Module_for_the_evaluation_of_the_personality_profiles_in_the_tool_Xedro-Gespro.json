{"id":"323268028_Module_for_the_evaluation_of_the_personality_profiles_in_the_tool_Xedro-Gespro","abstract":"Software companies, faced with the tendency and responsibility of generating quality computer systems, have needed a trained and committed staff; being administered the same by the department of Human Resources of each entity. Currently in the production centers of the University of Computer Science, Human Resources Management is done through the Xedro-Gespro Project Management tool. In the Human Resources module, the personal data of project members are stored and their results are managed, based on the knowledge of their work performance with respect to some indicators. However, the personal characteristics of individuals in the assignment process are not taken into account. This results in incorrect project estimates with respect to the tasks to be assigned and the time of their delays, the mismatch of staff characteristics with assigned roles and complexity when establishing locations within the group. The present research proposes the implementation of a module for the evaluation of the personality profiles in the tool Xedro-Gespro as support to the allocation of human resources jobs. Using the SCRUM\nmethodology, a module was developed that helped define roles according to personal traits, recognize personalities that conflict in a project, determine the right person for each task, and create groups of works with similar characteristics.","authors":["Arisney Figueredo Ramos","Esmerida Yanet Perez Varona","Roger ruiz Palomino"],"meta":["November 2017","Projects: Gestión de proyectos InformáticosComputer Project Management"],"references":[]}
