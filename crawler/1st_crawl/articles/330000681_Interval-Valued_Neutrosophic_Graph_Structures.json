{"id":"330000681_Interval-Valued_Neutrosophic_Graph_Structures","abstract":"In this chapter, we present certain notions of interval-valued neutrosophic graph structures. We elaborate the concepts of interval-valued neutrosophic graph structures with examples. Moreover, we discuss the concept of \\(\\varphi \\)-complement of an interval-valued neutrosophic graph structure. Finally, we describe some related properties, including \\(\\varphi \\)-complement, totally self-complementary and totally strong self-complementary, of interval-valued neutrosophic graph structures. This chapter is due to [35].","authors":["Muhammad Akram"],"meta":["January 2018","DOI:10.1007/978-981-13-3522-8_5","In book: Single-Valued Neutrosophic Graphs (pp.213-237)"],"references":[]}
