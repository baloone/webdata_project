{"id":"338683157_Topological_Descriptor_of_2-Dimensional_Silicon_Carbons_and_Their_Applications","abstract":"The Chemical graph theory is extensively used in finding the atomic supplementary properties of different chemical stuructures. Many results of graph theory are commonly used in molecular structures and in general in Chemisty. In a molcular graph vertices are atoms while chemical bonds are given by edges. This article is about computing the exact values for some degree based toplogical descriptors of two molecular structures. Namely we work on the silicon-carbon Si 2 C 3 - III and SiC 3 - III for dimension two. We also discuss some applications of these results towards Chemistry.","authors":["Muhammed Nadeem","Sarfraz Ahmad","Muhammad Kamran Siddiqui","Muhammad Naeem Azhar"],"meta":["December 2019Open Chemistry 17(1):1473-1482","DOI:10.1515/chem-2019-0155"],"references":["331470460_Zagreb_Connection_Number_Index_of_Nanotubes_and_Regular_Hexagonal_Lattice","331469166_Topological_Indices_of_Hyaluronic_Acid-Paclitaxel_Conjugates'_Molecular_Structure_in_Cancer_Treatment","328151099_Topological_Properties_of_2-Dimensional_Silicon-Carbons","327149772_Vertex-weighted_Wiener_polynomials_for_composite_graphs","326036790_Possibility_of_C38_and_Si19Ge19_Nanocages_in_Anode_of_Metal_Ion_Batteries_Computational_Examination","324853965_On_the_Maximum_ABC_Index_of_Graphs_With_Prescribed_Size_and_Without_Pendent_Vertices","323072583_Total_domination_and_open_packing_in_some_chemical_graphs","319600362_Topological_Characterization_of_Carbon_Graphite_and_Crystal_Cubic_Carbon_Structures","349636515_Vertex-degree_based_topological_indices_of_digraphs","332662007_On_the_Total_Double_Roman_Domination"]}
