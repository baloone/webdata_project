{"id":"352857113_QHSL_A_Quantum_Hue_Saturation_and_Lightness_Color_Model","abstract":"Image processing with any potential quantum computing hardware requires a quantum color model capable of capturing and manipulating color information in images. In this study, a quantum hue, saturation, and lightness (QHSL) model is proposed as a first attempt to encode perceptually relevant triplet color components using the properties of quantum mechanics (i.e., entanglement and parallelism). The proposed color model was used to define a representation of two-dimensional QHSL images for storage and transformation with fewer computing resources. The configuration of color-assignment attributes within this QHSL representation offer useful applications for image analysis. Specifically, a pseudocolor technique with flexible gray depth divisions is presented for highlighting fine visual details.","authors":["Fei Yan","Nianqiao Li","Kaoru Hirota"],"meta":["June 2021Information Sciences 577(4)","DOI:10.1016/j.ins.2021.06.077"],"references":["343438490_Key_questions_for_the_quantum_machine_learner_to_ask_themselves","341297443_WOTS-S_A_Quantum_Secure_Compact_Signature_Scheme_for_Distributed_Ledger","335424468_Quantum_Image_Watermarking_Algorithm_Based_on_Haar_Wavelet_Transform","312091720_Flexible_Representation_and_Manipulation_of_Audio_Signals_on_Quantum_Computers","311962365_A_novel_quantum_representation_of_color_digital_images","311067084_Quantum_Machine_Learning","301667750_New_Approach_to_Image_Edge_Detection_Based_on_Quantum_Entropy","286904546_A_survey_of_quantum_image_representations","283184075_Possiblistic-Fuzzy_C-Means_Clustering_Approach_for_the_Segmentation_of_Satellite_Images_in_HSL_Color_Space","266462481_Understanding_Color_Models_A_Review","263810963_Hue_and_Saturation_in_the_RGB_Color_Space","257641933_NEQR_A_novel_enhanced_quantum_representation_of_digital_images","253242162_Towards_Realising_Secure_and_Efficient_Image_and_Video_Processing_Applications_on_Quantum_Computers","253158806_Storing_Processing_and_Retrieving_an_Image_using_Quantum_Mechanics","228574906_Quantum_bit_string_comparator_Circuits_and_applications","224718760_Identifying_Computer_Graphics_using_HSV_Color_Model_and_Statistical_Moments_of_Characteristic_Functions","222251920_Simulations_of_quantum_neural_networks","2201383_Quantum_Networks_for_Elementary_Arithmetic_Operations","2201176_Elementary_gates_for_quantum_computation","342823094_Hierarchical_Improvement_of_Quantum_Approximate_Optimization_Algorithm_for_Object_Detection_Invited_Paper","342061634_A_quantum_mechanics-based_framework_for_EEG_signal_feature_extraction_and_classification","333501633_Efficient_quantum-based_security_protocols_for_information_sharing_and_data_protection_in_5G_networks","326562895_Quantum_Implementation_Circuits_of_Quantum_Signal_Representation_and_Type_Conversion","321884889_Color_image_representation_model_and_its_application_based_on_an_improved_FRQI","311255491_Real_time_implementation_of_RGB_to_HSVHSIHSL_and_its_reverse_color_space_models","280912430_Efficient_quantum_tomography","276107085_Quantum_image_pseudocolor_coding_based_on_the_density-stratified_method","275431758_Quantum_cryptographic_algorithm_for_color_images_using_quantum_Fourier_transform_and_double_random-phase_encoding","274375502_A_Multi-Channel_Representation_for_Images_on_Quantum_Computers_using_RGBa_Color_Space","262194492_Multidimensional_color_image_storage_retrieval_and_compression_based_on_quantum_amplitudes_and_phases","260912480_Histogram-based_segmentation_of_quantum_images","257641775_Novel_image_encryptiondecryption_based_on_quantum_Fourier_transform_and_double_phase_encoding","255904253_Quantum_Mechanics_Helps_in_Searching_for_a_Needle_in_a_Haystack","235800177_A_flexible_representation_of_quantum_images_for_polynomial_preparation_image_compression_and_processing_operations_Quantum_Inf","221151073_New_applications_of_quantum_algorithms_to_computer_graphics_The_quantum_random_sample_consensus_algorithm","220311495_Watermarking_and_authentication_of_quantum_images_based_on_restricted_geometric_transformations","220153284_Strategies_for_designing_geometric_transformations_on_quantum_images","37414323_Standard_RGB_color_spaces","12044234_Implementation_of_the_Quantum_Fourier_Transform","2661734_Algorithms_for_Quantum_Computation_Discrete_Logarithms_and_Factoring"]}
