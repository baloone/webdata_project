{"id":"346841241_Improvement_of_a_t_n_Threshold_d_-_Level_Quantum_Secret_Sharing_Scheme","abstract":"Recently, a threshold d âˆ’ level quantum secret sharing scheme was presented by Song et al. However, Kao et al. showed that in contrary to Song claim, the reconstructor cannot recover the secret without receiving any information from the other participants. To remedy this weakness, we will propose a new version of Song scheme.","authors":["Samaneh Mashhadi"],"meta":["November 2020Journal of Applied Security Research","DOI:10.1080/19361610.2020.1840894"],"references":["337939357_Efficient_Quantum_Secure_Direct_Communication_Protocol_Based_on_Quantum_Channel_Compression","322685183_Multi-dimensional_quantum_state_sharing_based_on_quantum_Fourier_transform","288073552_d-Dimensional_quantum_state_sharing_with_adversary_structure","323510319_Comment_on_t_n_Threshold_d-level_Quantum_Secret_Sharing","319267121_Multilayer_quantum_secret_sharing_based_on_GHZ_state_and_generalized_Bell_basis_measurement_in_multiparty_agents","301239489_d_-Dimensional_quantum_secret_sharing_without_entanglement","296716040_A_quantum_secret_sharing_scheme_on_access_structure","290625519_Verifiable_tn_threshold_quantum_secret_sharing_using_d-dimensional_Bell_state","257641917_Secret_sharing_based_on_quantum_Fourier_transform","228109551_Quantum_secret_sharing","220425267_How_to_Share_a_Secret"]}
