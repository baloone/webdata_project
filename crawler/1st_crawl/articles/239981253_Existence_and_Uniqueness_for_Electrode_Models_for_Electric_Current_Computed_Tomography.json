{"id":"239981253_Existence_and_Uniqueness_for_Electrode_Models_for_Electric_Current_Computed_Tomography","abstract":"The following experiment is considered. To a body of given conductivity, a number of electrodes are attached, through which current is sent. On the same electrodes, the resulting voltages are measured. This experiment can be described by a number of mathematical models. These models are discussed and their predictions compared with experiment. In particular, a model is exhibited that is capable of predicting the experimentally measured voltages to within 0.1 percent. For this model, existence and uniqueness of the associated electrical potential is proved.","authors":["Margaret Cheney","E.
