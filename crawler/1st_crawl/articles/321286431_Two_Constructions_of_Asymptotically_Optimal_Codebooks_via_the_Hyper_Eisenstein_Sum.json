{"id":"321286431_Two_Constructions_of_Asymptotically_Optimal_Codebooks_via_the_Hyper_Eisenstein_Sum","abstract":"Codebooks with low-coherence have wide utilization in many fields such as direct spread code division multiple access communications, compressed sensing and so on. There are two major ingredients in this paper. The first is to present a new character sum, the hyper Eisenstein sum and study the properties of this character sum. As an application, the second ingredient is to propose two constructions of codebooks with the hyper Eisenstein sum. The codebooks generated by these constructions asymptotically meet the Welch bound. The parameters of these codebooks are new.","authors":["Gaojun Luo","Xiwang Cao"],"meta":["November 2017IEEE Transactions on Information Theory PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TIT.2017.2777492","Project: NSFC 11371011"],"references":["280445306_Packing_Lines_Planes_etc_Packings_in_Grassmannian_Space","316079570_New_Constructions_of_Asymptotically_Optimal_Codebooks_With_Multiplicative_Characters","301847046_Equiangular_tight_frames_from_hyperovals","301845871_Tremain_equiangular_tight_frames","285296495_Packing_in_grassmannian_spaces","274403287_Tables_of_the_existence_of_equiangular_tight_frames","267172731_New_nearly_optimal_codebooks_from_relative_difference_sets","262416938_Near-Optimal_Partial_Hadamard_Codebook_Construction_Using_Binary_Sequences_Obtained_From_Quadratic_Residue_Mapping","260712444_New_Constructions_of_Codebooks_Nearly_Meeting_the_Welch_Bound_With_Equality","254061567_A_Construction_of_Codebooks_Associated_With_Binary_Sequences"]}
