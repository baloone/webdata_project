{"id":"355795996_A_Theorem_on_Numbers_of_the_Form_10X","abstract":"Number theory is one of the core branches of pure mathematics. It has played an important role in the study of natural numbers. In this paper, we are presenting a theorem on the numbers of form 10^ x, where x∊ Z+. The proposed theorem have a major application in computer science. It can be used to predict ‘n’bits which will always represent more than 10^ x total numbers. We proved that the nature of the ‘n’bits is always one of the forms 10i, 10i+ 4, or 10i+ 7, where i∊ W.","authors":["Ravin Kumar"],"meta":["October 2021","DOI:10.51483/IJPAMR.1.1.2021.55-57"],"references":["266916505_Introduction_to_Number_Theory","264931955_An_introduction_to_number_theory_with_cryptography","220111178_Lower_Bounds_for_Arithmetic_Problems"]}
