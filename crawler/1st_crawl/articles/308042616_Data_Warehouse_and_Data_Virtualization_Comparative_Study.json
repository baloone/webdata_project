{"id":"308042616_Data_Warehouse_and_Data_Virtualization_Comparative_Study","abstract":"Currently, in the competitive world of business organizations is changing. This has led to the decision-making systems are changing, and as it is known that the decision-making systems rely entirely on Business Intelligence and this in turn depends on the accuracy of the data integration process. However, there are two main types of data integration, the first one is physical integration represented by Data Warehouse, while the other named by virtual integration represented by Data Virtualization. In this paper, we review both techniques (Data Warehouse and Data Virtualization) in addition to the listed usefulness and disadvantages of each, the main contribution of this paper is a comparison between (DW and DV) to help researchers in this area and the developers of the best decision-making through the process of building their applications.","authors":["Ayad Hameed Mousa","Norshuhada Shiratuddin"],"meta":["December 2015","DOI:10.1109/DeSE.2015.26","Conference: 2015 International Conference on Developments of E-Systems Engineering (DeSE)","Project: Data Virtualization Project"],"references":["275068752_Virtual_Data_Mart_for_Measuring_Organizational_Achievement_Using_Data_Virtualization_Technique_KPIVDM","268271859_BUSINESS_INTELLIGENCE_FOR_INFRASTRUCTURE_AND_CONSTRUCTION_INDUSTRY","237345320_Knowledge_Warehouse_An_Architectural_Integration_of_Knowledge_Management_Decision_Support_Data_Mining_and_Data_Warehousing","221310175_Temporal_queries_in_OLAP","220802574_Changes_of_Dimension_Data_in_Temporal_Data_Warehouses","4086548_An_approach_for_automatic_data_virtualization","262408823_A_user-driven_data_warehouse_evolution_approach_for_concurrent_personalized_analysis_needs","243774405_Data_Warehouse_From_Architecture_to_Implementation","235720398_Providing_OLAP_On-line_Analytical_Processing_to_User-Analysts_An_IT_Mandate","234785651_Using_the_data_warehouse","230699307_CB4-03_An_Eye_on_the_Future_A_Review_of_Data_Virtualization_Techniques_to_Improve_Research_Analytics","228296467_A_Virtual_Data_Warehouse_for_Manufacturing_Industry","226987818_Architecture_for_Virtualization_in_Data_Warehouse","225265738_Temporal_Structures_in_Data_Warehousing","221181418_The_Next_Stage_of_Operational_Business_Intelligence_Creating_New_Challenges_for_Business_Process_Management","220940935_Assessing_Data_Virtualization_for_Irregularly_Replicated_Large_Datasets","220353505_An_Architecture_for_a_Business_and_Information_System","220207987_Real_time_business_intelligence_in_supply_chain_analytics","38007791_The_Entity_Relationship_Model_-_Toward_a_Unified_View_of_Data","31698287_The_data_warehouse_lifecycle_toolkit_expert_methods_for_designing_developing_and_deploying_data_warehouses_R_Kimball_et_al"]}
