{"id":"274012216_Ergodic_Time-Reversible_Chaos_for_Gibbs'_Canonical_Oscillator","abstract":"Nos\\'e's pioneering 1984 work inspired a variety of time-reversible\ndeterministic thermostats. Though several groups have developed successful\ndoubly-thermostated models, single-thermostat models have failed to generate\nGibbs' canonical distribution for the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator. A\n2001 doubly-thermostated model, claimed to be ergodic, has a\nsingly-thermostated version. Though neither of these models is ergodic this\nwork has suggested a successful route toward singly-thermostated ergodicity. We\nillustrate both ergodicity and its lack for these models using phase-space\ncross sections and Lyapunov instability as diagnostic tools.","authors":["William Graham Hoover","Julien Clinton Sprott","Puneet Patra"],"meta":["August 2015Physics Letters A","DOI:10.1016/j.physleta.2015.08.034","SourcearXiv"],"references":["287996327_Canonical_Dynamics_Equilibrium_Phase-Space_Distributions","279930885_Lyapunov_characteristic_exponents_for_smooth_dynamical_systems_and_for_Hamiltonian_systems_a_method_for_computing_all_of_them_Part_1_theory","271532613_Ergodicity_of_the_Martyna-Klein-Tuckerman_Thermostat_and_the_2014_Ian_Snook_Prize","271080315_Deterministic_Time-Reversible_Thermostats_Chaos_Ergodicity_and_the_Zeroth_Law_of_Thermodynamics","268155920_Improving_the_ergodic_characteristics_of_thermostats_using_higher_order_temperatures","263811870_Nonergodicity_of_the_Nose-Hoover_chain_thermostat_in_computationally_achievable_time","237725107_Kinetic_moments_method_for_the_canonical_ensemble_distribution","234921675_Nos-Hoover_chains_The_canonical_ensemble_via_continuous_dynamics","256156991_A_Numerical_Approach_to_Ergodic_Problem_of_Dissipative_Dynamical_Systems","235473279_Time-reversible_dissipative_attractors_in_three_and_four_phase-space_dimensions"]}
