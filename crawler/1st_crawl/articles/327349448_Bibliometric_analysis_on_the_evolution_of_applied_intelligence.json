{"id":"327349448_Bibliometric_analysis_on_the_evolution_of_applied_intelligence","abstract":"The Applied Intelligence (APIN) published its first issue in 1991 and it is one of the important academic journals in the field of computer science. This study aims to examine the structure and citation landscape as well as the evolution of the APIN journal based on all the APIN articles included in web of science core collection database. Research results of this study including the author characteristics, manuscript characteristics, productive and influential institutions and countries. Various kinds of networks are provided to visualize the complex relationships from different perspectives, including institutions and countries. The co-occurrence network and detection of the bursting keywords are used to explore the research hotspots in the APIN journal. The main advantage of this study is that it provides a comprehensive and objective view of the APIN journal. This study is very helpful for scholars to grasp the content structure and development process of APIN journal. It is also valuable for scholars in the field of artificial intelligence to identify the research hotspots in this field.","authors":["Dejian Yu","Zeshui Xu","Hamido Fujita"],"meta":["February 2019Applied Intelligence 49(1)","DOI:10.1007/s10489-018-1278-z"],"references":["325650424_Twenty-Five_Years_of_Group_Decision_and_Negotiation_A_Bibliometric_Overview","325056964_Women_as_Political_Leaders_a_Bibliometric_Analysis_of_the_Literature","324204708_A_Bibliometric_History_of_the_Journal_of_Psychology_Between_1936_and_2015","322233404_Bibliometric_and_Scientometric_Analysis_of_the_Articles_Published_in_the_Journal_of_Religion_and_Health_Between_1975_and_2016","324501572_A_Bibliometric_Analysis_of_the_First_Twenty-Five_Years_of_the_International_Journal_of_Uncertainty_Fuzziness_and_Knowledge-Based_Systems","322860274_Fifty_years_of_the_European_Journal_of_Marketing_a_bibliometric_analysis","322580001_Bibliometric_analysis_of_a_century_of_research_on_oral_erythroplakia_and_leukoplakia","321472423_Fifty_Years_of_Information_Sciences_A_Bibliometric_Overview","321269797_Bibliometric_analysis_of_fuzzy_theory_research_in_China_A_30-year_perspective","320600875_Bibliometric_Analysis_of_Manuscript_Characteristics_That_Influence_Citations_A_Comparison_of_Six_Major_Radiology_Journals","320100622_Bibliometric_Analysis_of_the_Flow_of_Publications_by_Novosibirsk_State_University_in_Collaboration_with_the_RAS_Siberian_Branch","318322844_Detecting_and_predicting_the_topic_change_of_Knowledge-based_Systems_A_topic-based_bibliometric_analysis_from_1991_to_2016","320577241_Mapping_the_field_of_arts-based_management_Bibliographic_coupling_and_co-citation_analyses","320107397_Mapping_the_knowledge_domains_of_Building_Information_Modeling_BIM_A_bibliometric_approach","319056299_Information_Sciences_1968-2016_A_retrospective_analysis_with_text_mining_and_bibliometric"]}
