{"id":"278048960_Bottom_Up_Quotients_and_Residuals_for_Tree_Languages","abstract":"In this paper, we extend the notion of tree language quotients to bottom-up\nquotients. Instead of computing the residual of a tree language from top to\nbottom and producing a list of tree languages, we show how to compute a set of\nk-ary trees, where k is an arbitrary integer. We define the quotient formula\nfor different combinations of tree languages: union, symbol products,\ncompositions, iterated symbol products and iterated composition. These\ncomputations lead to the definition of the bottom-up quotient tree automaton,\nthat turns out to be the minimal deterministic tree automaton associated with a\nregular tree language in the case of the 0-ary trees.","authors":["Jean-Marc Champarnaud","Ludovic Mignot","Nadia Ouali-Sebti","Djelloul Ziadi"],"meta":["June 2015","SourcearXiv","Project: Tree automata from regular expressions"],"references":["336892248_An_Efficient_Algorithm_for_the_Equation_Tree_Automaton_via_the_textdollarktextdollar-C-Continuations","261136550_k-Position_Follow_Equation_and_k-C-Continuation_Tree_Automata_Constructions","259875009_An_Efficient_Algorithm_for_the_Equation_Tree_Automaton_via_the_k-C-Continuations","230876408_Finite_Automata_and_Their_Decision_Problems","224959267_Some_Combinatorial_Operators_in_Language_Theory","284210954_An_algorithm_for_constructing_a_base_in_a_language_of_regular_expressions","265990523_From_Regular_Tree_Expression_to_Position_Tree_Automaton","253068166_The_Abstract_Theory_of_Automata","224377572_Derivatives_of_Tree_Sets_with_Applications_to_Grammatical_Inference","222734141_Partial_derivatives_of_regular_expressions_and_finite_automaton_constructions"]}
