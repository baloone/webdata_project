{"id":"264917026_Escaping_Free-Energy_Minima","abstract":"We introduce a powerful method for exploring the properties of the multidimensional free energy surfaces (FESs) of complex many-body systems by means of coarse-grained non-Markovian dynamics in the space defined by a few collective coordinates. A characteristic feature of these dynamics is the presence of a history-dependent potential term that, in time, fills the minima in the FES, allowing the efficient exploration and accurate determination of the FES as a function of the collective coordinates. We demonstrate the usefulness of this approach in the case of the dissociation of a NaCl molecule in water and in the study of the conformational changes of a dialanine in solution.","authors":["Michele Parrinello"],"meta":["November 2002Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 99(20):12562","DOI:10.1073/pnas.202427399","SourcearXiv"],"references":["234955743_Free_energy_from_constrained_molecular_dynamics","234875634_Calculation_of_conformational_transitions_and_barriers_in_solvated_systems_Application_to_the_alanine_dipeptide_in_water","222866627_Constrained_Reaction_Coordinate_Dynamics_for_the_Simulation_of_Rare_Events","15459795_Local_Elevation_A_Method_for_Improving_the_Searching_Properties_of_Molecular_Dynamics_Simulation","12515510_Reaction_Coordinates_of_Biomolecular_Isomerization","12043820_Efficient_Multiple-Range_Random_Walk_Algorithm_to_Calculate_the_Density_of_States","11396430_Transition_Path_Sampling_Throwing_Ropes_over_Rough_Mountain_Passes_in_the_Dark","6026283_Optimization_by_Simulated_Annealing","253487752_A_Method_for_Accelerating_the_Molecular_Dynamics_Simulation_of_Infrequent_Events","253163505_Meta-analysis_of_the_risks_of_hypertension_and_QTc_prolongation_in_patients_with_advanced_non-small_cell_lung_cancer_who_were_receiving_vandetanib","239582331_Stochastic_Relaxation_Gibbs_Distributions_and_the_Bayesian_Resoration_of_Images","234932676_Structure_optimization_via_free_energy_gradient_method_Application_to_glycine_zwitterion_in_aqueous_solution","234919330_Puddle-skimming_An_efficient_sampling_of_multidimensional_configuration_space","231664104_Kinetic_Pathways_of_Ion_Pair_Dissociation_in_Water","225092266_A_Second_Generation_Force_Field_for_the_Simulation_of_Proteins","224877385_Hyperdynamics_Accelerated_Molecular_Dynamics_of_Infrequent_Events","224877349_Simple_bias_potential_for_boosting_molecular_dynamics_with_the_hyperdynamics_scheme","220182914_Geman_D_Stochastic_relaxation_Gibbs_distribution_and_the_Bayesian_restoration_of_images_IEEE_Trans_Pattern_Anal_Mach_Intell_PAMI-66_721-741","37431273_Canonical_Adiabatic_Free_Energy_Sampling_CAFES_A_Novel_Method_for_the_Exploration_of_Free_Energy_Surfaces","37431245_Efficient_multidimensional_free_energy_calculations_for_ab_initio_molecular_dynamics_using_classical_bias_potentials","13325039_Predicting_Slow_Structural_Transitions_in_Macromolecular_Systems_Conformational_Flooding","11813746_Action-Derived_Molecular_Dynamics_in_the_Study_of_Rare_Events"]}
