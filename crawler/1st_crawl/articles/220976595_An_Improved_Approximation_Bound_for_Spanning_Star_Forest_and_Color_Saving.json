{"id":"220976595_An_Improved_Approximation_Bound_for_Spanning_Star_Forest_and_Color_Saving","abstract":"We present a simple algorithm for the maximum spanning star forest problem. We take advantage of the fact that the problem is a special case of complementary set cover and we adapt an algorithm of Duh and Furer in order to solve it. We prove that this algorithm computes 193/240 â‰ˆ 0.804-approximate spanning star forests; this result improves a previous lower bound of 0.71 by Chen et al. Although the algorithm is purely combinatorial, our analysis defines a linear program that uses a parameter f and which is feasible for values of the parameter f not smaller than the approximation ratio of the algorithm. The analysis is tight and, interestingly, it also applies to complementary versions of set cover such as color saving; it yields the same approximation guarantee of 193/240 that marginally improves the previously known upper bound of Duh and Furer. We also show that, in general, a natural class of local search algorithms do not provide better than 1/2-approximate spanning star forests.","authors":["Stavros Athanassopoulos","Ioannis Caragiannis","Christos Kaklamanis","Maria Kyropoulou"],"meta":["August 2009","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-03816-7_9","SourceDBLP","Conference: Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science 2009, 34th International Symposium, MFCS 2009, Novy Smokovec, High Tatras, Slovakia, August 24-28, 2009.
