{"id":"227198056_The_Kernel_and_Bargaining_Set_for_Convex_Games","abstract":"It is shown that for convex games the bargaining set\n\n1\n(i)\n(for the grand coalition) coincides with the core. Moreover, it is proved that the kernel (for the grand coalition) of convex games consists of a unique point which coincides with the nucleolus of the game.","authors":["M.
