{"id":"338664237_Warp_A_Hardware_Platform_for_Efficient_Multimodal_Sensing_With_Adaptive_Approximation","abstract":"In this article, we present Warp, the first open hardware platform designed explicitly to support research in approximate computing. Warp incorporates 21 sensors, computation, and circuit-level facilities designed explicitly to enable approximate computing research, in a 3.6 cm × 3.3 cm × 0.5 cm device. Warp supports a wide range of precision and accuracy versus power and performance tradeoffs.","authors":["Phillip Stanley-Marbell","Martin Rinard"],"meta":["January 2020IEEE Micro 40(1):57-66","DOI:10.1109/MM.2019.2951004"],"references":["239761658_Systems_ASPLOS'12_Architecture_Support_for_Disciplined_Approximate_Programming","221568667_A_Wirelessly-Powered_Platform_for_Sensing_and_Computation","221091615_RFID_sensor_networks_with_the_intel_WISP","220938741_Dynamic_Knobs_for_Responsive_Power-Aware_Computing","345124624_AXSERBUS_A_quality-configurable_approximate_serial_bus_for_energy-efficient_sensing","329404627_A_Reconfigurable_Energy_Storage_Architecture_for_Energy-harvesting_Devices","323951386_A_Reconfigurable_Energy_Storage_Architecture_for_Energy-harvesting_Devices","323791632_Flicker_Rapid_Prototyping_for_the_Batteryless_Internet-of-Things","316949100_High-level_synthesis_of_approximate_hardware_under_joint_precision_and_voltage_scaling","314861206_EnerJ_approximate_data_types_for_safe_and_general_low-power_computation","305628810_Verifying_quantitative_reliability_for_programs_that_execute_on_unreliable_hardware","303542661_Reducing_serial_IO_power_in_error-tolerant_applications_by_efficient_lossy_encoding","301282221_Crayon_saving_power_through_shape_and_color_approximation_on_next-generation_displays","282965661_Efficiency_Limits_for_Value-Deviation-Bounded_Approximate_Communication","262160049_Uncertain_A_First-Order_Type_for_Uncertain_Data","254005038_Algorithmic_methodologies_for_ultra-efficient_inexact_architectures_for_sustaining_technology_scaling","239826629_A_Programming_Model_and_Language_Implementation_for_Concurrent_Failure-Prone_Hardware","224706011_An_09_x_12_Low_Power_Energy-Harvesting_System_with_Custom_Multi-Channel_Communication_Interface","220752183_EnerJ_Approximate_Data_Types_for_Safe_and_General_Low-Power_Computation"]}
