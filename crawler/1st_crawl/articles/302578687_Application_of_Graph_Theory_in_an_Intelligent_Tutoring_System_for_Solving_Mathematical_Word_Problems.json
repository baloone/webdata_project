First; categorizing the characteristics of motion problems, second; suggesting a model for the categories were carried out. In order to solve all categories of the problems, graph theory including backward and forward chaining techniques of artificial intelligence were utilized. The study outlines the adoption of graph theory in to the motion problems and put forth some evidence that the model solves almost all of the motion problems. In conclusion, the recommended model can be suggested to be used in educational software in the problem solving context.","authors":["Vasif Nabiyev","Ünal Çakıroğlu","Hasan KARAL","Ali Kürşat Erümit"],"meta":["April 2016Eurasia Journal of Mathematics, Science and Technology Education 12(4):687-701","DOI:10.12973/eurasia.2015.1401a","Project: Design, Implementation and Evaluation of a Game based Adaptive Intelligent Tutoring System toward Improving  of Students’ Problem Solving Skills"],"references":["332012041_APPLICATIONS_OF_GRAPH_THEORY_IN_COMPUTER_SCIENCE_AN_OVERVIEW","285493059_The_Usage_of_problem_solving_method_in_social_knowledge_lesson_given_in_primary_schools","326010161_Applications_of_Graph_Theory","289963732_Modelling_reality_in_mathematics_classrooms_The_coase_of_word_problems","285744887_Matematik_derslerinde_basariya_giden_yolda_prolem_cozmenin_rolu","273411089_Bond_graph_modeling_approach_development_for_fuel_cell_PEMFC_systems","272523611_Graph_Theory_in_the_Geosciences","271960731_Upper_Elementary_School_Pupils'_Difficulties_in_Modeling_and_Solving_Nonstandard_Additive_Word_Problems_Involving_Ordinal_Numbers","268152960_A_design-by-contract_approach_to_recover_the_architectural_style_from_run-time_misbehaviour","265338214_Hybrid_CADE_platform_supporting_exploratory_architectural_design"]}
