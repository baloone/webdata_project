{"id":"338799606_Integrated_photonic_guided_metalens_based_on_a_pseudo-graded_index_distribution","abstract":"In this article, we report an integrated optical nanolens exhibiting a pseudo-graded index distribution in a guided configuration. This dielectric metalens relies on a permittivity distribution through dielectric strips of the core material, which is compatible with existing silicon photonic technology. We show in this paper that effective medium theory (EMT) inaccurately predicts the focal length of such devices, and we propose an efficient and accurate design approach based on 2D finite element method (FEM) mode calculations that are in good agreement with 3D FDTD simulations. The lens was fabricated on a 200 mm silicon on insulator pilot line, and fibre-to-fibre optical characterizations revealed an excellent transmission of 85% for TM polarization, in line with the simulated performance (90%). The proposed approach can be easily extended to width-variable strips, enabling the realization of all types of graded index devices, especially those derived from transformation optics.","authors":["Karim Hassan","Jacques-Alexandre Dallery","Pierre Brianceau","Salim Boutami"],"meta":["January 2020Scientific Reports 10(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-020-58029-z"],"references":["327785582_Outfitting_Next_Generation_Displays_with_Optical_Metasurfaces","319213883_Gradient_metasurfaces_A_review_of_fundamentals_and_applications","312512944_Recent_advances_in_planar_optics_From_plasmonic_to_dielectric_metasurfaces","274403306_Inverse_design_and_demonstration_of_a_compact_and_broadband_on-chip_wavelength_demultiplexer","310487702_Fronts_propagating_with_curve-dependent_speed_algorithms_based_on_Hamilton-Jacobi_formulations","303779506_Metalenses_at_visible_wavelengths_Diffraction-limited_focusing_and_subwavelength_resolution_imaging","299644650_Experimental_study_of_silicon_ring_resonators_and_ultra-low_losses_waveguides_for_efficient_silicon_optical_interposers","292792509_Controlling_electromagnetic_fields","279413945_Optical_Waveguide_Theory","271272046_Light_propagation_with_phase_discontinuities_generalized_laws_of_reflection_and_refraction"]}
