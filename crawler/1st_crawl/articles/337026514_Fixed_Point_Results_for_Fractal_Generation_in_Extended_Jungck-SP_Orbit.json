{"id":"337026514_Fixed_Point_Results_for_Fractal_Generation_in_Extended_Jungck-SP_Orbit","abstract":"In this paper, we extend Jungck–SP iteration with s–convexity in second sense and define its orbit. We prove the fixed point results for fractal generation via extended iteration and utilize these results to develop algorithms for fractal visualization. Moreover, we present some complex graphs of Julia and Mandelbrot sets in Jungck–SP orbit with s–convexity. We also present some examples to show the variation in images with involved parameters.","authors":["Xiangyang Li","Muhammad Tanveer","Mujahid Abbas","Maqbool Ahmad"],"meta":["November 2019IEEE Access PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2951385","Project: Some fixed point results in the generation of fractals "],"references":["333497994_Boundaries_of_Filled_Julia_Sets_in_Generalized_Jungck_Mann_Orbit","331690526_Fractal_Generation_in_Modified_Jungck-S_Orbit","330379116_Mandelbrot_and_Julia_Sets_via_Jungck-CR_Iteration_with_s-Convexity","324229351_Fixed_point_results_for_the_complex_fractal_generation_in_the_S_-iteration_orbit_with_s_-convexity","319979740_Fractal_patterns_from_the_dynamics_of_combined_polynomial_root_finding_methods","311575887_New_tricorns_and_multicorns_antifractals_in_Jungck_Mann_orbit","325390228_Pickover_biomorphs_and_non-standard_complex_numbers","315142624_Polynomiography_for_the_polynomial_infinity_norm_via_Kalantari's_formula_and_nonstandard_iterations","313533484_Biomorphs_with_memory","312893008_Real-time_obstacle_avoidance_for_manipulators_and_mobile_robots"]}
