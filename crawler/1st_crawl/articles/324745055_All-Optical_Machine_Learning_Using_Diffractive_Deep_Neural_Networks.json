{"id":"324745055_All-Optical_Machine_Learning_Using_Diffractive_Deep_Neural_Networks","abstract":"We introduce an all-optical Diffractive Deep Neural Network (D2NN) architecture that can learn to implement various functions after deep learning-based design of passive diffractive layers that work collectively. We experimentally demonstrated the success of this framework by creating 3D-printed D2NNs that learned to implement handwritten digit classification and the function of an imaging lens at terahertz spectrum. With the existing plethora of 3D-printing and other lithographic fabrication methods as well as spatial-light-modulators, this all-optical deep learning framework can perform, at the speed of light, various complex functions that computer-based neural networks can implement, and will find applications in all-optical image analysis, feature detection and object classification, also enabling new camera designs and optical components that can learn to perform unique tasks using D2NNs.","authors":["Xing Lin","Yair Rivenson","Nezih Tolga Yardimci","Muhammed Veli"],"meta":["April 2018Science 361(6406)","DOI:10.1126/science.aat8084"],"references":["321761248_Deep_Learning_Enhanced_Mobile-Phone_Microscopy","317709471_Terahertz_saturable_absorbers_from_liquid_phase_exfoliation_of_graphite","316955101_Deep_Learning_Microscopy","316874912_Phase_recovery_and_holographic_image_reconstruction_using_deep_learning_in_neural_networks","314115656_Lensless_computational_imaging_through_deep_learning","313857891_A_Survey_on_Deep_Learning_in_Medical_Image_Analysis","322995773_Nonlinear_Metasurface_Based_on_Giant_Optical_Kerr_Response_of_Gold_Quantum_Wells","315766440_Learning_a_Variational_Network_for_Reconstruction_of_Accelerated_MRI_Data","312771295_Image_quality_assessment_From_error_visibility_to_structural_similarity","312152791_Poisson_surface_reconstruction"]}
