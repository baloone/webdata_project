{"id":"334057993_Developing_and_Implementing_a_Web-Based_Platform_for_Skills_and_Knowledge_Exchange","abstract":"The emergence of computer networking, e-mail and computer conferencing for exchange of scientific information encouraged the adoption of a collaborative learning approach to meet the needs of both learners. The platform aims to improve community culture and knowledge by allowing the exchange of skills within the community through a free electronic platform. It aims to shorten the distance between individuals and enrich the content of the platform with new courses including computer science, engineering, programming, artificial intelligence and space sciences. The platform aims to establish partnerships and cooperation agreements with regional and international leading institutions to exchange and develop skills and expertise. Also to improve and facilitate the process of communication between the parties to the maximum extent which ensures the success of the exchange process. The proposed system was developed using the Unified Modeling Language (UML) and Microsoft Visual Studio2010 programming language.","authors":["Amani Al-Ghamdi","Dalal Al Harbi","Naseebah Alarfaj","Bandar Al Hajri"],"meta":["June 2019International Journal of Scientific Research in Science and Technology","DOI:10.32628/IJSRST196345"],"references":["333604383_DEVELOPING_AND_IMPLEMENTING_A_WEB-BASED_RECYCLING_SYSTEM_FOR_PROTECTING_THE_GREEN_ENVIRONMENT","331533882_Arabic_Voice_Recognition_Using_Fuzzy_Logic_and_Neural_Network","330841291_Analyzing_and_Implementing_an_Online_Metro_Reservation_System","328335250_An_Elite_Pool-Based_Big_Bang-Big_Crunch_Metaheuristic_for_Data_Clustering","325737624_The_important_of_service_quality_and_the_trust_in_technology_on_users_perspectives_to_continues_use_of_mobile_services","325361012_Looking_Inside_and_Outside_the_System_Examining_the_Factors_Influencing_Distance_Learners_Satisfaction_in_Learning_Management_System","324174644_Real-Time_Elderly_Healthcare_Monitoring_Expert_System_Using_Wireless_Sensor_Network","323572885_A_Novel_Technique_Based_on_Visual_Words_Fusion_Analysis_of_Sparse_Features_for_Effective_Content-Based_Image_Retrieval","323397735_Hybrid_Elitist-Ant_System_for_Nurse-Rostering_Problem","332207416_Determinants_of_deposit_of_commercial_banks_in_Sudan_an_empirical_investigation_1970-2012"]}
