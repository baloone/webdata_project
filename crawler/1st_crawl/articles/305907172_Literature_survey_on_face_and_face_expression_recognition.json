{"id":"305907172_Literature_survey_on_face_and_face_expression_recognition","abstract":"Face Expression Recognition (FER) has become a very interesting and challenging area in computer vision field due to its wide application possibilities. Mental state Recognition, Human Computer Interaction, Human behavior understanding etc. are some of its applications. Because of its wide application possibilities Face expression recognition has attained a very crucial role in the area of facial image processing. In this paper some of the tailor made face expression Recognition algorithms are presented. This paper also gives a brief insight into the feature extraction method of these face expression recognition techniques. The features extraction technique plays a crucial role in the efficiency of these algorithms. In this paper a few Face Expression Recognition techniques like Patched Geodesic Texture Transform, Curvelet Feature Extraction, Bag of Words Method, Local Directional Number Pattern, Regional Registration Technique, Gradient Feature Matching etc. which are used to recognize the facial expression are presented.","authors":["J Anil","L.
