{"id":"334407683_Synchrosqueezing_transforms_From_low-_to_high-frequency_modulations_and_perspectives","abstract":"The general aim of this paper is to introduce the concept of synchrosqueezing transforms (SSTs) that was developed to sharpen linear timeâ€“frequency representations (TFRs), like the short-time Fourier or the continuous wavelet transforms, in such a way that the sharpened transforms remain invertible. This property is of paramount importance when one seeks to recover the modes of a multicomponent signal (MCS), corresponding to the superimposition of AM/FM modes, a model often used in many practical situations. After having recalled the basic principles of SST and explained why, when applied to an MCS, it works well only when the modes making up the signal are slightly modulated, we focus on how to circumvent this limitation. We then give illustrations in practical situations either associated with gravitational wave signals or modes with fast oscillating frequencies and discuss how SST can be used in conjunction with a demodulation operator, extending existing results in that matter. Finally, we list a series of different perspectives showing the interest of SST for the signal processing community.","authors":["Sylvain Meignen","Thomas Oberlin","Duong Hung Pham"],"meta":["July 2019","DOI:10.1016/j.crhy.2019.07.001"],"references":["324603412_Fast_and_Adaptive_Blind_Audio_Source_Separation_Using_Recursive_Levenberg-Marquardt_Synchrosqueezing","315525747_High-Order_Synchrosqueezing_Transform_for_Multicomponent_Signals_Analysis_-_With_an_Application_to_Gravitational-Wave_Signal","312640653_On_Demodulation_Ridge_Detection_and_Synchrosqueezing_for_Multicomponent_Signals","329391982_On_the_time-frequency_reassignment_of_interfering_modes_in_multicomponent_FM_signals","321994204_Analyzing_transient-evoked_otoacoustic_emissions_by_concentration_of_frequency_and_time","317730432_The_second-order_wavelet_synchrosqueezing_transform","316588757_A_Wavelet_Tour_of_Signal_Processing","312100089_Heart_beat_classification_from_single-lead_ECG_using_the_synchrosqueezing_transform","311505896_Sleep_Apnea_Detection_Based_on_Thoracic_and_Abdominal_Movement_Signals_of_Wearable_Piezo-Electric_Bands","304256263_GW151226_Observation_of_Gravitational_Waves_from_a_22-Solar-Mass_Binary_Black_Hole_Coalescence"]}
