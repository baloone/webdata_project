Diethyl ether in proportions of 5%, 10% and 15% by volume is added to diesel fuel and tests are carried out 20MPa, 22MPa and 24MPa fuel injection pressure. The results indicated that the brake thermal efficiency increased by 19% at 24MPa for E5D95 blend and brake specific fuel consumption is 11% more than the diesel fuel. Substantial decrease in NOx is noticed with increase in composition of Diethyl ether and injection pressure. CO and HC emissions are found to be higher at higher injection pressure. There is a reduction in smoke emission with addition of Diethyl ether and increased injection pressure. On the basis of performance and emission characteristics E5D95 blend is found to be the optimum blend.","authors":["Salumari Madhu","A.V. Krishna Chaitanya","P.
