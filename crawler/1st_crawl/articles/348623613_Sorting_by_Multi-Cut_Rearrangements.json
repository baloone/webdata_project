{"id":"348623613_Sorting_by_Multi-Cut_Rearrangements","abstract":"Let S be a string built on some alphabet \\(\\varSigma \\). A multi-cut rearrangement of S is a string \\(S'\\) obtained from S by an operation called k-cut rearrangement, that consists in (1) cutting S at a given number k of places in S, making S the concatenated string \\(X_1\\cdot X_2\\cdot X_3\\ldots X_k\\cdot X_{k+1}\\), where \\(X_1\\) and \\(X_{k+1}\\) are possibly empty, and (2) rearranging the \\(X_i\\)s so as to obtain \\(S'=X_{\\pi (1)}\\cdot X_{\\pi (2)}\\cdot X_{\\pi (3)}\\ldots X_{\\pi (k+1)}\\), \\(\\pi \\) being a permutation on \\(1,2\\ldots k+1\\) satisfying \\(\\pi (1)=1\\) and \\(\\pi (k+1)=k+1\\). Given two strings S and T built on the same multiset of characters from \\(\\varSigma \\), the Sorting by Multi-cut Rearrangements (SMCR) problem asks whether a given number \\(\\ell \\) of \\(k\\)-cut rearrangements suffices to transform S into T. The SMCR problem generalizes and thus encompasses several classical genomic rearrangements problems, such as Sorting by Transpositions and Sorting by Block Interchanges. It may also model chromoanagenesis, a recently discovered phenomenon consisting in massive simultaneous rearrangements. In this paper, we study the SMCR problem from an algorithmic complexity viewpoint, and provide, depending on the respective values of k and \\(\\ell \\), polynomial-time algorithms as well as NP-hardness, FPT-algorithms, W[1]-hardness and approximation results, either in the general case or when S and T are permutations.","authors":["Laurent Bulteau","Guillaume Fertin","Geraldine Jean","Christian Komusiewicz"],"meta":["January 2021","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-67731-2_43"],"references":["338892910_Chromoanagenesis_A_piece_of_the_macroevolution_scenario","236621733_Minimum_Common_String_Partition_Parameterized_by_Partition_Size_Is_Fixed-Parameter_Tractable","236031813_Combinatorics_of_Genome_Rearrangements","221543537_Minimum_Common_String_Partition_Problem_Hardness_and_Approximations","338532075_Minimum_Common_String_Partition_Problem_Hardness_and_Approximations","313903170_Parameterized_Algorithms","268413146_Genome_Rearrangement_Problems","265502171_Fundamentals_of_Parameterized_Complexity","222197449_Sorting_permutations_by_block-interchanges","220618108_Genome_Rearrangements_and_Sorting_by_Reversals"]}
