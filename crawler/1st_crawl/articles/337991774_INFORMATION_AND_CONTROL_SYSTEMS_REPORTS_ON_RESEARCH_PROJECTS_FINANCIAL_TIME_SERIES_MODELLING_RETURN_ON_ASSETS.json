In\naddition, financial activity plays an important role in the\nglobal economy, influencing the economic development\nof most countries of the world [1]. In financial markets,\nthe success of an investor depends on the quality of the\ninformation that it uses to support decision-making, as\nwell as how quickly it is able to make decisions. Therefore,\ndue to its practical importance, the analysis of financial\nmarkets in recent decades has been widely studied by\nscientists in the field of mathematics, computer science\nand engineering [2].\nForecasting financial time series can be considered one\nof the main tasks in the scientific literature, the purpose\nof which is to study time series [3, 4]. Recall that a time\nseries is a set of observations xt , determined at time t ,\nthat is, it is a series of data points indexed in chronological\norder.\nAnalysis of financial time series follows from the theory\nand practice of valuing financial assets over time. Letâ€™s\nnote that there is a key feature that distinguishes the\nanalysis of financial time series from the analysis of other\ntime series, which is that financial theory and its empirical\ntime series contain an element of uncertainty.","authors":["Mykola Yaroslavovych Kushnir","K.
