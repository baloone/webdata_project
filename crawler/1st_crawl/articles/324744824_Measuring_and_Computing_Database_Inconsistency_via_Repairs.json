{"id":"324744824_Measuring_and_Computing_Database_Inconsistency_via_Repairs","abstract":"We propose a generic numerical measure of inconsistency of a database with respect to integrity constraints that is based on a repair semantics. A particular measure is investigated, with mechanisms for computing it via answer-set programs.","authors":["Leopoldo Bertossi"],"meta":["April 2018"],"references":["269635896_From_Causes_for_Database_Queries_to_Repairs_and_Model-Based_Diagnosis_and_Back","234831120_The_DLV_System_for_Knowledge_Representation_and_Reasoning","220842789_Data_Quality_Is_Context_Dependent","220421804_Answer_Set_Programming_at_a_Glance","46584330_The_Complexity_of_Causality_and_Responsibility_for_Query_Answers_andnon-Answers","45865816_Prioritized_Repairing_and_Consistent_Query_Answering_in_RelationalDatabases","2613974_Distance_Measures_for_Point_Sets_and_Their_Computation","324582330_Characterizing_and_Computing_Causes_for_Query_Answers_in_Databases_from_Database_Repairs_and_Repair_Programs","305804863_On_the_Compliance_of_Rationality_Postulates_for_Inconsistency_Measures_A_More_or_Less_Complete_Picture","301798657_Analysing_inconsistent_information_using_distance-based_measures","252923167_From_Database_Repair_Programs_to_Consistent_Query_Answering_in_Classical_Logic","222430659_Minimal-Change_Integrity_Maintenance_Using_Tuple_Deletions","220350475_The_consistency_extractor_system_Answer_set_programs_for_consistent_query_answering_in_databases","220151389_Approximate_Inference_of_Functional_Dependencies_from_Relations"]}
