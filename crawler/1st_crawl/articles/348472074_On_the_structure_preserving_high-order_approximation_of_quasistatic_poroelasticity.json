{"id":"348472074_On_the_structure_preserving_high-order_approximation_of_quasistatic_poroelasticity","abstract":"We consider the systematic numerical approximation of Biot’s quasistatic model for the consolidation of a poroelastic medium. Various discretization schemes have been analysed for this problem and inf-sup stable finite elements have been found suitable to avoid spurios pressure oscillations in the initial phase of the evolution. In this paper, we first clarify the role of the inf-sup condition for the well-posedness of the continuous problem and discuss the choice of appropriate initial conditions. We then develop an abstract error analysis that allows us to analyse some approximation schemes discussed in the literature in a unified manner. In addition, we propose and analyse the high-order time discretization by a scheme that can be interpreted as a variant of continuous-Galerkin or particular Runge–Kutta methods applied to a modified system. The scheme is designed to preserve both, the underlying differential–algebraic structure and the energy-dissipation property of the problem. In summary, we obtain high-order Galerkin approximations with respect to space and time and derive order-optimal convergence rates. The numerical analysis is carried out in detail for the discretization of the two-field formulation by Taylor-Hood elements and a variant of a Runge–Kutta time discretization.","authors":["Herbert Egger","Mania Sabouri"],"meta":["January 2021Mathematics and Computers in Simulation 189","DOI:10.1016/j.matcom.2020.12.029"],"references":["332190209_Conservative_discretizations_and_parameter-robust_preconditioners_for_Biot_and_multiple-network_flux-based_poroelasticity_models","321962825_A_Finite_Element_Method_with_Strong_Mass_Conservation_for_Biot's_Linear_Consolidation_Model","318997722_A_Study_of_Two_Modes_of_Locking_in_Poroelasticity","317344423_Parameter-robust_stability_of_classical_three-field_formulation_of_Biot's_consolidation_model","310610287_Space-time_finite_element_approximation_of_the_Biot_poroelasticity_system_with_iterative_coupling","309922265_Locking-Free_Finite_Element_Methods_for_Poroelasticity","260435565_A_coupling_of_nonconforming_and_mixed_finite_element_methods_for_Biot's_consolidation_model","227912147_On_stability_and_convergence_of_finite_element_approximations_of_Biot's_consolidation_theory","222615750_Improved_accuracy_in_finite_element_analysis_of_Biot's_consolidation_problem","341662477_Parameter-Robust_Convergence_Analysis_of_Fixed-Stress_Split_Iterative_Method_for_Multiple-Permeability_Poroelasticity_Systems","324353887_Galerkin_Finite_Element_Methods_for_Parabolic_Problems","313416599_Finite_element_methods_for_coupled_thermoelasticity_and_coupled_consolidation_of_clay","284417313_The_existence_and_uniqueness_theorem_in_Biot's_consolidation_theory","267660147_Mixed_Finite_Element_Methods_and_Applications","266238967_The_existence_and_uniqueness_theorem_in_Biot's_consolidation_theory","250797901_A_coupling_of_mixed_and_continuous_Galerkin_finite_element_methods_for_poroelasticity_I_The_continuous_in_time_case","248071340_Theory_Practice_of_Finite_Elements","243095412_A_Priori_L_2_Error_Estimates_for_Galerkin_Approximations_to_Parabolic_Partial_Differential_Equations","234384975_Finite_Element_Methods_For_Navier_Stokes_Equations","233777644_On_the_Existence_Uniqueness_and_Approximation_of_Saddle-Point_Problems_Arising_from_Lagrangian_Multipliers","230872702_Numerical_Solution_of_Initial-Value_Problems_In_Differential-Algebraic_Equations","226661614_An_Analysis_of_a_Mixed_Finite_Element_Method_for_the_Navier-Stokes_Equations","225591174_Galerkin_and_Runge-Kutta_methods_Unified_formulation_a_posteriori_error_estimates_and_nodal_superconvergence","225349403_A_coupling_of_mixed_and_continuous_Galerkin_finite_element_methods_for_poroelasticity_II_The_discrete-in-time_case","225111058_A_coupling_of_mixed_and_discontinuous_Galerkin_finite-element_methods_for_poroelasticity","224558403_General_Theory_of_Three-Dimensional_Consolidation","222297655_Diffusion_in_Poro-Elastic_Media","222108923_Differential_Algebraic_Equations","27292235_Partial_Differential_Equations"]}
