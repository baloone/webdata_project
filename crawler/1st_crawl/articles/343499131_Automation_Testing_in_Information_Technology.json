{"id":"343499131_Automation_Testing_in_Information_Technology","abstract":"Despite the proliferation of quality assurance tools and experts, IT software testing has been critical in the development and security of software systems in the internet space. The complexities and challenges of testing have pushed experts to the technology of test automation, which comes in several phases and with ultimate calls for heightened levels of management and control. In this paper, a clear demonstration of the automation approaches and the development approaches is eminent. The results of the research clearly show that automating software testing realms is the new strategy that is poised to change the usability, security, efficiency, and reliability of the current and future software programs.","authors":["Sikender Mohsienuddin Mohammad"],"meta":["August 2015SSRN Electronic Journal 3(3):118-125","DOI:10.1729/Journal.24200","Project: DevOps -Automation"],"references":["261392355_Benefits_and_limitations_of_automated_software_testing_Systematic_literature_review_and_practitioner_survey","260338818_Continuous_Software_Engineering_and_Beyond_Trends_and_Challenges","46093544_Different_Forms_of_Software_Testing_Techniques_for_Finding_Errors","4200308_Observations_and_lessons_learned_from_automated_testing"]}
