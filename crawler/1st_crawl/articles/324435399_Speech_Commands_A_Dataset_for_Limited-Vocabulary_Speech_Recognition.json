{"id":"324435399_Speech_Commands_A_Dataset_for_Limited-Vocabulary_Speech_Recognition","abstract":"Describes an audio dataset of spoken words designed to help train and evaluate keyword spotting systems. Discusses why this task is an interesting challenge, and why it requires a specialized dataset that is different from conventional datasets used for automatic speech recognition of full sentences. Suggests a methodology for reproducible and comparable accuracy metrics for this task. Describes how the data was collected and verified, what it contains, previous versions and properties. Concludes by reporting baseline results of models trained on this dataset.","authors":["Pete Warden"],"meta":["April 2018"],"references":["322222339_Did_you_hear_that_Adversarial_Examples_Against_Automatic_Speech_Recognition","321511154_Raw_Waveform-based_Audio_Classification_Using_Sample-level_CNN_Architectures","267269056_A_Dataset_and_Taxonomy_for_Urban_Sound_Research","221361415_ImageNet_a_Large-Scale_Hierarchical_Image_Database","354164346_Convolutional_neural_networks_for_small-footprint_keyword_spotting","320727094_Deep_Residual_Learning_for_Small-Footprint_Keyword_Spotting","320582667_Listening_to_the_World_Improves_Speech_Command_Recognition","308871877_Librispeech_An_ASR_corpus_based_on_public_domain_audio_books","268378927_A_SPEAKER-INDEPENDENT_CONNECTED-DIGIT_DATABASE"]}
