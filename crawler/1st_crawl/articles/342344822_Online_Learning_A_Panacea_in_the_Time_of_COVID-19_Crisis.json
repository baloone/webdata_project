{"id":"342344822_Online_Learning_A_Panacea_in_the_Time_of_COVID-19_Crisis","abstract":"Educational institutions (schools, colleges, and universities) in India are currently based only on traditional methods of learning, that is, they follow the traditional set up of face-to-face lectures in a classroom. Although many academic units have also started blended learning, still a lot of them are stuck with old procedures. The sudden outbreak of a deadly disease called Covid-19 caused by a Corona Virus (SARS-CoV-2) shook the entire world. The World Health Organization declared it as a pandemic. This situation challenged the education system across the world and forced educators to shift to an online mode of teaching overnight. Many academic institutions that were earlier reluctant to change their traditional pedagogical approach had no option but to shift entirely to online teachingâ€“learning. The article includes the importance of online learning and Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, & Challenges (SWOC) analysis of e-learning modes in the time of crisis. This article also put some light on the growth of EdTech Start-ups during the time of pandemic and natural disasters and includes suggestions for academic institutions of how to deal with challenges associated with online learning.","authors":["Shivangi Dhawan"],"meta":["June 2020Journal of Educational Technology Systems","DOI:10.1177/0047239520934018"],"references":["341358623_Designing_Quality_E-Learning_Environments_for_Emergency_Remote_Teaching_in_Coronavirus_Crisis","341208076_Campus_traffic_and_e-Learning_during_COVID-19_pandemic","339944395_How_to_Optimize_Online_Learning_in_the_Age_of_Coronavirus_COVID-19_A_5-Point_Guide_for_Educators","339942263_From_Offline_to_Online_Challenges_and_Opportunities_for_Entrepreneurship_Education_Following_the_COVID-19_Pandemic","339740614_Replacing_the_Classic_Learning_Form_at_Universities_as_an_Immediate_Response_to_the_COVID-19_Virus_Infection_in_Georgia","322082661_E-learning_resilience_and_change_in_higher_education_Helping_a_university_cope_after_a_natural_disaster","319013030_Issues_and_Challenges_for_Teaching_Successful_Online_Courses_in_Higher_Education_A_Literature_Review","336170577_How_Many_Ways_Can_We_Define_Online_Learning_A_Systematic_Literature_Review_of_Definitions_of_Online_Learning_1988-2018","322767060_Online_learning_during_post-earthquake_school_closures","320658940_The_academic_impact_of_natural_disasters_evidence_from_L'Aquila_earthquake"]}
