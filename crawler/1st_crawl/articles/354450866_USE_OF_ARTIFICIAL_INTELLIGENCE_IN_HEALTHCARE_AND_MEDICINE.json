{"id":"354450866_USE_OF_ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE_IN_HEALTHCARE_AND_MEDICINE","abstract":"Artificial Intelligence is a field of computer science that mimic human cognitive functions. It has brought a paradigm shift in the medical field mostly due to the increase in healthcare data and rapid increase of analytical techniques [1]. In recent years AI has surpassed human performance in several medical field areas, and this is a great adoption in healthcare. Also, through the use of analytical techniques, AI has the capabilities to prevent, detect, diagnose, and treat a wide range of diseases. This research paper will discuss different types of Artificial Intelligence techniques and how AI has been used in healthcare. Also, it will provide a view of the future of Artificial Intelligence in healthcare.","authors":["Deekshaa Khanna","Mustafa Shuaieb Sabri"],"meta":["December 2018SSRN Electronic Journal 5(12):21-25"],"references":["354192967_Significance_of_developing_Multiple_Big_Data_Analytics_Platforms_with_Rapid_Response","353889380_Identity-based_Encryption_From_Identity_and_Access_Management_to_Enterprise_Privacy_Management","353887659_SYSTEMATIC_REVIEW_OF_IDENTITY_ACCESS_MANAGEMENT_IN_INFORMATION_SECURITY","349641584_DATA_MODELS_IN_INFORMATION_TECHNOLOGY","336794637_Artificial_Intelligence_in_the_Healthcare_Sector","324986571_Artificial_Intelligence_in_Drug_Discovery_and_Development","340343667_Cloud_Computing_Opportunities_And_Challenges","332297314_Intelligent_Healthcare_For_Future_Medicine","326881703_Cloud_computing-enabled_healthcare_opportunities_issues_and_applications_A_systematic_review","301276894_Survey_of_Data_Mining_Techniques_used_in_Healthcare_Domain","261028220_Artificial_Intelligence_in_Psychological_Practice_Current_and_Future_Applications_and_Implications","258285203_A_survey_on_Data_Mining_approaches_for_Healthcare","262030045_Deep_Learning_in_Neural_Networks_An_Overview","220546862_Evolution_of_artificial_intelligence","51196180_Artificial_Intelligence_in_Medicine_AIME_2009"]}
