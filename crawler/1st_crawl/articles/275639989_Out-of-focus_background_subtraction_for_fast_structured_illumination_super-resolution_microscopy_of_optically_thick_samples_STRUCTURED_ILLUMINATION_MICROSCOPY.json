Indeed, obtaining super-resolution images of thick samples is a difficult task if low spatial frequencies are present in the in-focus section of the sample, as these frequencies have to be distinguished from the out-of-focus background. A rigorous treatment would require a 3D reconstruction of the whole sample using a 3D point spread function and a 3D stack of structured illumination data. The number of raw images required, 15 per optical section in this case, limits the rate at which high-resolution images can be obtained. We show that by a succession of two different treatments of structured illumination data we can estimate the contrast of the illumination pattern and remove the out-of-focus content from the raw images. After this cleaning step, we can obtain super-resolution images of optical sections in thick samples using a two-beam harmonic illumination pattern and a limited number of raw images. This two-step processing makes it possible to obtain super resolved optical sections in thick samples as fast as if the sample was two-dimensional.\n© 2015 The Authors Journal of Microscopy © 2015 Royal Microscopical Society.","authors":["Pierre Vermeulen","Hong Zhan","François Orieux","Jean-Christophe Olivo-Marin"],"meta":["March 2015Journal of Microscopy 259(3)","DOI:10.1111/jmi.12259"],"references":["235415675_Phase_optimisation_for_structured_illumination_microscopy","233788031_Line_scan_-_Structured_illumination_microscopy_super-resolution_imaging_in_thick_fluorescent_samples","51719323_Super-resolution_3D_Microscopy_of_Live_Whole_Cells_Using_Structured_Illumination","51520255_Bayesian_Estimation_for_Optimized_Structured_Illumination_Microscopy","45275046_A_Guide_to_Super-Resolution_Fluorescence_Microscopy","44902640_Bayesian_estimation_of_regularization_and_point_spread_function_parameters_for_Wiener-Hunt_deconvolution","5663165_Method_of_obtaining_optical_sectioning_by_structured_light_in_a_conventional_microscope","295351037_Pushing_fluorescence_microscopy_resolution_to_the_nanoscale","275507996_Superresolution_Multidimensional_Imaging_with_Structured_Illumination_Microscopy","249332485_Properties_of_a_Defocused_Optical_System","233827980_Enhanced_image_reconstruction_of_three-dimensional_fluorescent_assays_by_subtractive_structured-light_illumination_microscopy","222410106_Image_formation_in_structured_immulination_wide-field_fluorescence_microsopy","12507845_Surpassing_the_lateral_resolution_limit_by_a_factor_of_two_using_structured_illumination_microscopy_SHORT_COMMUNICATION","8250531_Hell_SW_Dyba_M_Jakobs_S_Concepts_for_nanoscale_resolution_in_fluorescence_microscopy_Curr_Opin_Neurobiol_14_599-609","5524896_Three-Dimensional_Resolution_Doubling_in_Wide-Field_Fluorescence_Microscopy_by_Structured_Illumination"]}
