{"id":"340947217_Post-quantum_trapezoid_type_inequalities","abstract":"In this study, the assumption of being differentiable for the convex function f in the (p, q)-Hermite-Hadamard inequality is removed. A new identity for the right-hand part of (p, q)-Hermite-Hadamard inequality is proved. By using established identity, some (p, q)-trapezoid integral inequalities for convex and quasi-convex functions are obtained. The presented results in this work extend some results from the earlier research.","authors":["Muhammad Amer Latif","Mehmet Kunt","S. S.
