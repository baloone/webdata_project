{"id":"262334660_Some_Sahlqvist_Completeness_Results_for_Coalgebraic_Logics","abstract":"This paper presents a first step towards completeness-via-canonicity results for coalgebraic modal logics. Specifically, we consider the relationship between classes of coalgebras for Ï‰-accessible endofunctors and logics defined by Sahlqvist-like frame conditions. Our strategy is based on conjoining two well-known approaches: we represent accessible functors as (equational) quotients of polynomial functors and then use canonicity results for boolean algebras with operators to transport completeness to the coalgebraic setting.","authors":["Fredrik Dahlqvist","Dirk Pattinson"],"meta":["March 2013","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-37075-5_13","Conference: Proceedings of the 16th international conference on Foundations of Software Science and Computation Structures"],"references":["262255806_Presentation_of_Set_Functors","221570321_Beyond_Rank_1_Algebraic_Semantics_and_Finite_Models_for_Coalgebraic_Logics","45879604_Coalgebras_Chu_Spaces_and_Representations_of_Physical_Systems","313691347_Boolean_algebras_with_operators","279957800_6_Algebras_and_coalgebras","262389851_Modalities_in_the_Stone_age_A_comparison_of_coalgebraic_logics","257144679_Sahlqvist_theorem_for_modal_fixed_point_logic","243779915_Boolean_Algebras_with_Operators_Part_I","227716834_Completeness_for_the_coalgebraic_cover_modality","222840479_Universal_coalgebra_A_theory_of_systems","220297718_Sahlqvist's_theorem_for_Boolean_algebras_with_operators_with_an_application_to_cylindric_algebras","220297593_On_the_canonicity_of_Sahlqvist_identities","220152995_Coalgebraic_Semantics_of_Modal_Logics_an_Overview","220118090_A_Finite_Model_Construction_for_Coalgebraic_Modal_Logic"]}
