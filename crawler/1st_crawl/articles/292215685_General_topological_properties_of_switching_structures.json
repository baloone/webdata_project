{"id":"292215685_General_topological_properties_of_switching_structures","abstract":"Investigation of a wide variety of switching converter topologies culminates in the establishment of the most general correlation between the converter topologies--the duality relationships. The recognition of this general law leads to a number of new results: new converter topologies generated by the application of the duality transformation to the existing converter configurations, the discovery of the new mode of converter operation (discontinuous capacitance voltage mode) as well as significantly improved understanding of the existing converters and their equivalent circuit models.","authors":["Slobodan Cuk"],"meta":["June 1979","DOI:10.1109/PESC.1979.7081016","Conference: 1979 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference"],"references":[]}
