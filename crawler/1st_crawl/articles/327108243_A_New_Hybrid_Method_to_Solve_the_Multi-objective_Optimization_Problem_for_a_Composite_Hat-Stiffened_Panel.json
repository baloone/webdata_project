{"id":"327108243_A_New_Hybrid_Method_to_Solve_the_Multi-objective_Optimization_Problem_for_a_Composite_Hat-Stiffened_Panel","abstract":"In this paper we present a new hybrid meta heuristic by combining Multi-objective bat algorithm (MOBA) and variable neighborhood search (VNS). The hybrid meta heuristic is coupled with response surface methodology (or meta modeling) to solve the mechanical multi-objective optimization problem of hat stiffened composite panel. The optimization criteria were the weight and the rigidity of the panel. Experimental results show that our suggested approach is quite effective, as it provides solutions that are competitive with the results obtained by using MOBA alone and other state of the art optimization algorithms.","authors":["Ahmad El Samrout","Oussama Braydi","Rafic Younes","Francois Trouchu"],"meta":["January 2019Studies in Computational Intelligence","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-95104-1_5","In book: Bioinspired Heuristics for Optimization (pp.77-88)"],"references":["223234322_Multiobjective_stacking_sequence_optimization_for_laminated_composite_structures","222572022_Cost_optimization_of_composite_aircraft_structures_including_variable_laminate_qualities","290501437_Variable_Neighbourhood_Search","251542716_Computational_strategy_for_multiobjective_optimization_of_composite_stiffened_panels","236358164_A_comparative_study_of_genetic_algorithms_for_the_multi-objective_optimization_of_composite_stringers_under_compression_loads","233868697_Optimization_of_composite_stiffened_panels_under_mechanical_and_hygrothermal_loads_using_neural_networks_and_genetic_algorithms","223222835_Surrogate_modeling_in_design_optimization_of_stiffened_composite_shells","223155510_Y-stiffened_panel_multi-objective_optimization_using_genetic_algorithm","222707408_Stacking_sequence_optimization_to_maximize_the_buckling_load_of_blade-stiffened_panels_with_strength_constraints_using_the_iterative_fractal_branch_and_bound_method","222474461_Variable_Neighborhood_Search"]}
