{"id":"332253349_Proposed_Curriculum_Guidelines_for_Masters_Programs_in_EM_With_an_IS_Focus","abstract":"Information systems (IS) in emergency management (EM) support situational awareness and agility during a disaster so that professionals do not only need to follow rigid pre-defined plans that might be unsuitable in the unfolding situation. To use IS effectively, managers need an understanding of the capabilities of these systems; this can be achieved through an appropriate set of educational courses. This article presents the results of the analysis of a survey that proposed EM and IS courses for master level programs. The survey was completed by 373 practitioners, academics and/or researchers with EM experience. All proposed courses were rated above a 4 on a 7-point scale for how essential they are to a curriculum. A qualitative analysis indicates that some low ratings were due to disagreement over the described course content. An unexpected finding was that a substantial number of respondents spontaneously expressed opposition to the use of IS for EM in general. Findings are discussed and a preliminary curriculum is proposed.","authors":["Linda Plotnick","Starr Roxanne Hiltz","Murray Turoff","Julie Dugdale"],"meta":["January 2019","DOI:10.4018/IJISCRAM.2019010101","Project: Development of Curriculum Guidelines by the ISCRAM Education Committee"],"references":["317121475_A_Review_of_Qualitative_Comments_on_a_Proposed_Master's_Degree_in_Emergency_Management","307476568_Curriculum_Guidelines_for_Master's_Level_Programs_in_Information_Systems_for_Emergency_Management","307475796_Development_of_a_dynamic_scenario_model_for_the_interaction_of_critical_infrastructures","277940297_Enhancing_post-disaster_reconstruction_capacity_through_lifelong_learning_in_higher_education","273700070_Education_in_Disaster_Management_and_Emergencies_Defining_a_New_European_Course","254807211_The_design_of_a_Dynamic_Emergency_Response_Management_Information_System_DERMIS","251496891_Delphi_A_brief_look_backward_and_forward","322693087_Social_Media_in_Crisis_Management_An_Evaluation_and_Analysis_of_Crisis_Informatics_Research","305423820_Barriers_to_Use_of_Social_Media_by_Emergency_Managers","271805980_The_Organizational_And_Interorganisational_Development_Of_Disasters","247935033_IS_2010_Curriculum_Guidelines_for_Undergraduate_Degree_Programs_in_Information_Systems","228530616_Assuring_homeland_security_Continuous_monitoring_control_assurance_of_emergency_preparedness","8918430_Preparedness_for_Emergency_Response_Guidelines_for_the_Emergency_Planning_Process","249359160_Towards_the_Development_of_Standards_in_Emergency_Management_Training_and_Education","235319105_Training_emergency_managers_for_earthquake_response_Challenges_and_opportunities"]}
