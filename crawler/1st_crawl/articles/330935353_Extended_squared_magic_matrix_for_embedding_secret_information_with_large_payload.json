{"id":"330935353_Extended_squared_magic_matrix_for_embedding_secret_information_with_large_payload","abstract":"Data hiding is a technology designed for safely transmitting secret data through open communication channels, in which the secret data are embedded into a cover carrier imperceptibly. Among the existing data hiding schemes, the exploiting-modification-direction (EMD) based schemes draw considerable attentions due to large embedding capacity. The proposed scheme improves the EMD-2 scheme by constructing an extended squared magic matrix, resulting in a larger embedding capacity high up to 3.15 bits per pixel (bpp). Experimental results show that the proposed scheme outperforms state-of-the-art reference matrix based schemes in terms of embedding capacity, meanwhile, maintains good image quality.","authors":["Xiao-Zhu Xie","Yanjun Liu","Chih-Hsiang Chang"],"meta":["July 2019Multimedia Tools and Applications 78(3&4)","DOI:10.1007/s11042-019-7252-x"],"references":["322323136_Efficient_Information_Hiding_Based_on_Theory_of_Numbers","281674808_Reversible_Data_Hiding_in_JPEG_Images","327102128_A_Lossless_Data_Embedding_Technique_by_Joint_Neighboring_Coding","323979386_Extended_Exploiting-Modification-Direction_Data_Hiding_with_High_Capacity","313694441_Improved_detection_of_LSB_steganography_in_grayscale_images","312888624_Efficient_steganographic_embedding_by_exploiting_modification_direction","286725669_A_Novel_Turtle_Shell_Based_Scheme_for_Data_Hiding","283828302_High_capacity_turtle_shell-based_data_hiding","271951936_Reversible_data_hiding_scheme_based_on_exploiting_modification_direction_with_two_steganographic_images","239328938_A_method_of_obtaining_digital_signature_and_public_key_systems","220512549_Improved_modification_direction_methods","220354258_Techniques_for_Data_Hiding","225255362_Improved_Detection_of_LSB_Steganography_in_Grayscale_Images","220604109_High-capacity_image_hiding_scheme_based_on_vector_quantization","220426448_A_Method_for_Obtaining_Digital_Signatures_and_Public-Key_Cryptosystems"]}
