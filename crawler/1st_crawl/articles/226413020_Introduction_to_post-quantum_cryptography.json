{"id":"226413020_Introduction_to_post-quantum_cryptography","abstract":"Imagine that it’s fifteen years from now and someone announces the successful construction of a large quantum computer. The\nNew York Times runs a frontpage article reporting that all of the public-key algorithms used to protect the Internet have been broken. Users\npanic. What exactly will happen to cryptography?\n\nPerhaps, after seeing quantum computers destroy RSA and DSA and ECDSA, Internet users will leap to the conclusion that cryptography\nis dead; that there is no hope of scrambling information to make it incomprehensible to, and unforgeable by, attackers; that\nsecurely storing and communicating information means using expensive physical shields to prevent attackers from seeing the\ninformation—for example, hiding USB sticks inside a locked briefcase chained to a trusted courier's wrist.","authors":["Daniel J.
