{"id":"297597771_Spectral-Spatial_Sparse_Subspace_Clustering_for_Hyperspectral_Remote_Sensing_Images","abstract":"Clustering for hyperspectral images (HSIs) is a very challenging task due to its inherent complexity. In this paper, we propose a novel spectral-spatial sparse subspace clustering (S4C) algorithm for hyperspectral remote sensing images. First, by treating each kind of land-cover class as a subspace, we introduce the sparse subspace clustering (SSC) algorithm to HSIs. Then, considering the spectral and spatial properties of HSIs, the high spectral correlation and rich spatial information of the HSIs are taken into consideration in the SSC model to obtain a more accurate coefficient matrix, which is used to build the adjacent matrix. Finally, spectral clustering is applied to the adjacent matrix to obtain the final clustering result. Several experiments were conducted to illustrate the performance of the proposed S4C algorithm.","authors":["Hongyan Zhang","Han Zhai","Liangpei Zhang","Pingxiang Li"],"meta":["March 2016IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing 54(6):1-13","DOI:10.1109/TGRS.2016.2524557"],"references":["294119120_Sparsity-Regularized_Robust_Non-Negative_Matrix_Factorization_for_Hyperspectral_Unmixing","282547401_Total-Variation-Regularized_Low-Rank_Matrix_Factorization_for_Hyperspectral_Image_Restoration","276916443_Hyperspectral_Image_Denoising_via_Noise-Adjusted_Iterative_Low-Rank_Matrix_Approximation","260992374_Hyperspectral_Image_Restoration_Using_Low-Rank_Matrix_Recovery","258082242_A_novel_sparsity_and_clustering_regularization","244898935_Graph_Cuts_and_Efficient_ND_Image_Segmentation","241194954_Efficient_Clustering_for_High_Dimensional_Data_Subspace_Based_Clustering_and_Density_Based_Clustering","233932672_Pattern_Recognition_With_Fuzzy_Objective_Function_Algorithms","226029783_On_the_Douglas-Rachford_splitting_method_and_the_proximal_point_algorithm_for_maximal_monotone_operators","224078861_Double_Sparsity_Learning_Sparse_Dictionaries_for_Sparse_Signal_Approximation","221669342_Subspace_clustering_of_high-dimensional_data_A_predictive_approach","221663891_D-ADMM_A_Communication-Efficient_Distributed_Algorithm_For_Separable_Optimization","221344774_Combined_central_and_subspace_clustering_on_computer_vision_applications","220680974_Stable_recovery_of_sparse_overcomplete_representations_in_the_presence_of_noise","220660206_Spectral_Curvature_Clustering_SCC","220411713_An_Augmented_Lagrangian-Based_Approach_to_the_Oseen_Problem","320635634_Spectral-spatial_clustering_of_hyperspectral_remote_sensing_image_with_sparse_subspace_clustering_model","313487833_A_tutorial_on_spectral_clustering","312900100_Pattern_recognition_with_fuzzy_objective_function_algorithms_Kluwer_Academic","309715704_Least_squares_quantization_in_PCM","289541483_Noisy_sparse_subspace_clustering","287611684_Robust_sparsity_and_clustering_regularization_for_regression","274676904_HYPERSPECTRAL_IMAGE_DENOISING_WITH_CUBIC_TOTAL_VARIATION_MODEL","264564194_A_Nonlocal_Weighted_Joint_Sparse_Representation_Classification_Method_for_Hyperspectral_Imagery","263476029_Machine_learning_Clustering_by_fast_search_and_find_of_density_peaks","262412380_Latent_Space_Sparse_Subspace_Clustering","261923847_An_Adaptive_Memetic_Fuzzy_Clustering_Algorithm_With_Spatial_Information_for_Remote_Sensing_Imagery","260635916_Automatic_Fuzzy_Clustering_Based_on_Adaptive_Multi-Objective_Differential_Evolution_for_Remote_Sensing_Imagery","256993813_A_super-resolution_reconstruction_algorithm_for_hyperspectral_images","236771177_Remote_Sensing_Digital_Image_Analysis","235154359_Isodata_A_Novel_Method_of_Data_Analysis_and_Pattern_Classification","234801250_A_Tutorial_on_Spectral_Clustering","233786506_See_All_by_Looking_at_A_Few_Sparse_Modeling_for_Finding_Representative_Objects","233355808_Unsupervised_remote_sensing_image_classification_using_an_artificial_immune_network","224605770_Robust_Recovery_of_Signals_From_a_Structured_Union_of_Subspaces","224579212_Sparse_subspace_clustering","224353020_Spectral_and_Spatial_Classification_of_Hyperspectral_Data_Using_SVMs_and_Morphological_Profiles","224309574_Robust_Face_Recognition_via_Sparse_Representation","224149957_Clustering_disjoint_subspaces_via_sparse_representation","222859249_Fuzzy_Hierarchical_Analysis_The_Lambda-Max_Method","222841479_Fuzzy_hierarchical_analysis_revisited","222695091_Data_Clustering_50_Years_Beyond_K-Means","222625249_A_dual_algorithm_for_the_solution_of_nonlinear_variational_problems_via_finite_element_approximation","222430507_Sparse_Principal_Component_Analysis_via_Regularized_Low_Rank_Matrix_Approximation","222013900_Fuzzy_hierarchy_analysis_Fuzzy_Set_Syst","221364568_Segmenting_Motions_of_Different_Types_by_Unsupervised_Manifold_Clustering","220699451_Data_Clustering_50_Years_Beyond_K-means","220682848_Least_Squares_Quantization_in_PCM's","220182834_An_Optimal_Graph_Theoretic_Approach_to_Data_Clustering_Theory_and_Its_Application_to_Image_Segmentation","220049031_Normalized_Cuts_and_Image_Segmentation","215458876_A_General_Framework_for_Motion_Segmentation_Independent_Articulated_Rigid_Non-rigid_Degenerate_and_Non-degenerate","47438412_Hybrid_Linear_Modeling_via_Local_Best-Fit_Flats","46272633_An_Augmented_Lagrangian_Approach_to_the_Constrained_Optimization_Formulation_of_Imaging_Inverse_Problems","8254040_Robust_Image_Segmentation_Using_FCM_With_Spatial_Constraints_Based_on_New_Kernel-Induced_Distance_Measure","37594515_On_the_Douglas-Rachford_splitting_method_and_the_proximal_point_algorithm_for_maximal_monotone_operators"]}
