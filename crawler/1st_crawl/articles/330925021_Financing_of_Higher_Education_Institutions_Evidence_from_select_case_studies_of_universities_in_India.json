But, due to fiscal constraints and competing demands for public funds, the public sector in developing countries like India (with second largest higher education system in the world) has not been able to fulfil the expenditure needs for higher education. Many policy changes have taken place from time to time, more particularly after the new economic reforms of 1990s,to meet the aspirations of the students. These include expansion of private higher education institutions, and privatization of public institutions to offset in adequate funding by the government. However, it is found that higher education institutions at the sub national State level struggle to generate funds through various alternative sources to meet the recurring expenses of the institution concerned.","authors":["Jinusha Panigrahi"],"meta":["February 2019","Project: Financing of Public Higher Education Institutions"],"references":["322841818_Innovative_Financing_of_Higher_Education_Changing_Options_and_Implications","320322782_Academic_Performance_Indicators_Straitjacketing_Higher_Education","317739813_Resource_Allocation_and_Innovative_Methods_of_Financing_Higher_Education_in_India","228199812_Education_Finance_Policy_Financing_the_Non-Market_and_Social_Benefits","312322513_Public_Finance_in_Theory_and_Practice","262125705_Higher_Education_in_'Trishanku'_Hanging_between_State_and_Market","246007360_India_Economic_Development_and_Social_Opportunity","239657997_A_Pure_Theory_Public_Expenditure","44835506_Investing_in_Human_Capital_A_Capital_Markets_Approach_to_Student_Funding"]}
