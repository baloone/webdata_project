The aim of this paper is to propose ‘e-learning-by-developing’, a creative learning-by-experience methodology, that can support end-users to develop data intensive mobile applications. The proposed learning approach aims to create a training model for the acquisition of knowledge and development of skills for database-driven applications, by promoting active participation of the-user in the development process. Preliminary experimental evaluation showed that end-users, with limited prior database knowledge and development background, were able to quickly and efficiently design a relational scheme and create a reusable database driven mobile application.","authors":["Katerina Tzafilkou","Manto Chouliara","Nicolaos Protogeros","Charalampos Karagiannidis"],"meta":["November 2015","DOI:10.1109/IMCTL.2015.7359602","Conference: International Conference on Interactive Mobile Communication Technologies and Learning (IMCL).
