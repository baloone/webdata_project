{"id":"343496425_Constructing_Independent_Spanning_Trees_on_Transposition_Networks","abstract":"In interconnection networks, data distribution and fault tolerance are crucial services. This study proposes an effective algorithm for improving connections between networks. Transposition networks are a type of Cayley graphs and have been widely used in current networks. Whenever any connection node fails, users want to reconnect as rapidly as possible, it is urgently in need to construct a new path. Thus, searching node-disjoint paths is crucial for finding a new path in networks. In this paper, we expand the target to construct independent spanning trees to maximize the fault tolerance of transposition networks.","authors":["Chien-Fu Lin","Jie-Fu Huang","Sun-Yuan Hsieh"],"meta":["August 2020IEEE Access PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3014822"],"references":["333699968_Amortized_efficiency_of_constructing_multiple_independent_spanning_trees_on_bubble-sort_networks","301755220_Construction_independent_spanning_trees_on_locally_twisted_cubes_in_parallel","262405521_Node-Disjoint_Paths_Algorithm_in_a_Transposition_Graph","261988984_Automorphism_group_of_the_complete_transposition_graph","324566926_Transposition_Graphs_An_Intuitive_Approach_to_the_Parity_Theorem_for_Permutations","312216112_Node-Independent_Spanning_Trees_in_Gaussian_Networks","311550453_A_parallel_algorithm_for_constructing_independent_spanning_trees_in_twisted_cubes","282621569_A_Fast_Parallel_Algorithm_for_Constructing_Independent_Spanning_Trees_on_Parity_Cubes","274171451_Constructive_Algorithm_of_Independent_Spanning_Trees_on_Mobius_Cubes","260585342_Transposition_networks_as_a_class_of_fault-tolerant_robust_networks","228057767_The_Multi-Tree_Approach_To_Reliability_In_Distributed_Networks","257252088_An_efficient_parallel_construction_of_optimal_independent_spanning_trees_on_hypercubes","257145081_An_algorithm_to_construct_independent_spanning_trees_on_parity_cubes","256721175_Independent_spanning_trees_in_crossed_cubes","223734235_Symmetry_in_interconnection_networks_based_on_Cayley_graphs_of_permutation_groups_A_survey"]}
