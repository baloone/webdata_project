{"id":"226463709_Disciplined_Convex_Programming","abstract":"A new methodology for constructing convex optimization models called disciplined convex programming is introduced. The methodology enforces a set of conventions upon the models constructed, in turn allowing much of the work\nrequired to analyze and solve the models to be automated.","authors":["Michael Grant","Stephen Boyd","Yinyu Ye"],"meta":["January 2006","DOI:10.1007/0-387-30528-9_7","In book: Global Optimization (pp.155-210)","Project: CVX: Matlab Software for Disciplined Convex Programming"],"references":["280018811_SDPT3_-_a_MATLAB_software_package_for_semidefinite_programming_version_13","346368826_Convex_Analysis","325584533_Linear_Programming_and_Extensions","308632720_Least_Squares_Support_Vector_Machines","297976207_Bounds_on_measures_satisfying_moment_conditions","293143015_Free_material_distribution_via_mathematical_programming","285688992_Semidefinite_programming","284774119_Pathways_to_the_optimal_set_in_linear_programming_in_Progress_in_Mathematical_Programming","284284734_Finite_horizon_robust_Kalman_filter_design","275485261_GAMS_a_user's_guide","274238501_Linear_Programming_and_Extensions","268009124_4_sdpsol_A_ParserSolver_for_Semidefinite_Programs_with_Matrix_Structure","266939378_LANCELOT_A_Fortran_package_for_large-scale_nonlinear_optimization_Release_A","266039355_A_Course_in_Robust_Control_Theory_a_convex_approach","264956987_Convex_Analysis_and_Minimization_Algorithms_II_Advanced_Theory_and_Bundle_Methods"]}
