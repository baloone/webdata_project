{"id":"222732735_On_coloured_constant_composition_designs","abstract":"This paper deals with a particular class of coloured designs: the incidence vectors of all blocks of these designs have the same composition, and the same is true for the incidence vectors of all points. For this reason, we call these designs constant composition designs, or CC-designs for short. We will derive necessary and sufficient conditions on the existence and conclude the presentation with a collection of examples.","authors":["Marcus Greferath","Ryan K.
