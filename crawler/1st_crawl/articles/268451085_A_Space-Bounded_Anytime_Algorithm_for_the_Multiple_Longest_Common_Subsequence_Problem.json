{"id":"268451085_A_Space-Bounded_Anytime_Algorithm_for_the_Multiple_Longest_Common_Subsequence_Problem","abstract":"The multiple longest common subsequence (MLCS) problem, related to the identification of sequence similarity, is an important problem in many fields. As an NP-hard problem, its exact algorithms have difficulty in handling large-scale data and time- and space-efficient algorithms are required in real-world applications. To deal with time constraints, anytime algorithms have been proposed to generate good solutions with a reasonable time. However, there exists little work on space-efficient MLCS algorithms. In this paper, we formulate the MLCS problem into a graph search problem and present two space-efficient anytime MLCS algorithms, SA-MLCS and SLA-MLCS. SA-MLCS uses an iterative beam widening search strategy to reduce space usage during the iterative process of finding better solutions. Based on SA-MLCS, SLA-MLCS, a space-bounded algorithm, is developed to avoid space usage from exceeding available memory. SLA-MLCS uses a replacing strategy when SA-MLCS reaches a given space bound. Experimental results show SA-MLCS and SLA-MLCS use an order of magnitude less space and time than the state-of-the-art approximate algorithm MLCS-APP while finding better solutions. Compared to the state-of-the-art anytime algorithm Pro-MLCS, SA-MLCS and SLA-MLCS can solve an order of magnitude larger size instances. Furthermore, SLA-MLCS can find much better solutions than SA-MLCS on large size instances.","authors":["Yang Jiaoyun","Yun Xu","Yi Shang","Guoliang Chen"],"meta":["November 2014IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering 26(11):2599-2609","DOI:10.1109/TKDE.2014.2304464","SourcePubMed"],"references":["228864539_ANA_Anytime_nonparametric_A","221605240_Memory-Bounded_Bidirectional_Search","221603972_A_Fast_Heuristic_Search_Algorithm_for_Finding_the_Longest_Common_Subsequence_of_Multiple_Strings","221438820_Memory-Bounded_A_Graph_Search","220811869_AWA_-_A_Window_Constrained_Anytime_Heuristic_Search_Algorithm","220657059_Computing_a_Longest_Common_Subsequence_for_a_Set_of_Strings","220430854_Frontier_search","220225024_Progressive_Skyline_Computation_in_Database_Systems","18664612_Matching_Sequences_under_DeletionInsertion_Constraints","6583166_A_fast_parallel_algorithm_for_finding_the_longest_common_sequence_of_multiple_biosequences","278664991_Shooting_Stars_in_the_Sky","268407841_Algorithms_for_the_Longest_Approximate_Common_Subsequence_Problem","260358211_A_New_Progressive_Algorithm_for_a_Multiple_Longest_Common_Subsequences_Problem_and_Its_Efficient_Parallelization","250889980_Algorithms_for_the_longest_common_subsequence_problem_for_multiple_strings_based_on_geometric_maxima","238669640_An_algorithm_for_differential_file_comparison","228686236_ITSA_Iterative_tunneling_search_with_A","223062137_Heuristic_Search_in_Restricted_Memory","222447182_A_Faster_Algorithm_Computing_String_Edit_Distances","222429261_Anytime_search_in_dynamic_graphs","222177393_Fast_linear-space_computations_of_longest_common_subsequences","221633583_Probabilistic_Beam_Search_for_the_Longest_Common_Subsequence_Problem","221619552_ARA_Anytime_A_with_Provable_Bounds_on_Sub-Optimality","221606831_Complete_Anytime_Beam_Search","221605756_Anytime_Nonparametric_A","221604372_Divide-and-Conquer_Frontier_Search_Applied_to_Optimal_Sequence_Alignment","221393203_Breadth-First_Heuristic_Search","221310438_Shooting_Stars_in_the_Sky_An_Online_Algorithm_for_Skyline_Queries","220936131_Beam-Stack_Search_Integrating_Backtracking_with_Beam_Search","220814409_Sparse-Memory_Graph_Search","220812751_A_Divide_and_Conquer_Bidirectional_Search_First_Results","220545939_Breadth-first_heuristic_search","220543317_Anytime_Heuristic_Search","220472094_Beam_search_for_the_longest_common_subsequence_problem","220431502_Algorithms_for_the_Longest_Common_Subsequence_Problem","220430694_The_Complexity_of_Some_Problems_on_Subsequences_and_Supersequences","220073070_A_Fast_Multiple_Longest_Common_Subsequence_MLCS_Algorithm","49627069_-A_Memory-Bounded_Anytime_Heuristic-Search_Algorithm","37705096_Time_Warps_String_Edits_and_Macromolecules_The_Theory_and_Practice_of_Sequence_Comparison","15934339_Identification_of_Common_Molecular_Subsequences","15028184_Fingerprinting_G-protein-coupled_receptors","5683462_Next-generation_sequencing_transforms_today's_biology","4376064_An_Efficient_Parallel_Algorithm_for_the_Multiple_Longest_Common_Subsequence_MLCS_Problem","4046545_Sweep_A_Space-efficient_heuristic_search_in_partially_ordered_graphs","3871316_A_survey_of_longest_common_subsequence_algorithms","3116398_A_Sentence-to-Sentence_Clustering_Procedure_for_Pattern_Analysis","2709681_Efficient_Memory-Bounded_Search_Methods","2339893_Sequence_Comparison_Some_Theory_and_Some_Practice"]}
