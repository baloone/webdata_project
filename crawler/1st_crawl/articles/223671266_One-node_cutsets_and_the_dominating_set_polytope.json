{"id":"223671266_One-node_cutsets_and_the_dominating_set_polytope","abstract":"In this paper we study a composition (decomposition) technique for the dominating set polytope in graphs which are decomposable by one-node cutsets. If G decomposes into G1 and G2, we show that the dominating set polytope of G can be described from two linear systems related to G1 and G2. This gives a way to characterize this polytope for classes of graphs that can be recursively decomposed. This also gives a procedure to describe facets for this polytope. Application of these techniques is discussed for the class of the cactus.","authors":["Mustapha Bouchakour","Ali Ridha Mahjoub"],"meta":["March 1997Discrete Mathematics 165-166:101-123","DOI:10.1016/S0012-365X(96)00164-1"],"references":["266287431_Compositions_of_Graphs_and_Polyhedra_II_Stable_Sets","268635310_Polytope_Des_Absorbants_Dans_Une_Classe_De_Graphe_a_Seuil","256417033_A_linear_algorithm_for_finding_a_minimum_dominating_set_in_a_cactus","256391745_On_a_Composition_of_Independence_Systems_by_Circuit-Identification","256158081_Compositions_in_the_bipartite_subgraph_polytope","248131117_Towards_a_theory_of_domination_in_graphs","247003662_On_domination_and_independent_domination_number_of_graphs","243531499_Introduction_to_combinatorial_mathematics","242463593_The_Theory_of_Graphs_and_Its_Applications","238878817_Of_Stable_Marriages_and_Graphs_and_Strategy_and_Polytopes","238688691_INTRODUCTION_TO_COMBINATORIAL_MAPS","230596096_The_Theory_of_Graphs","230596009_A_Linear_Algorithm_for_the_Domination_Number_of_a_Series-Parallel_Graph","230595844_Graphs_and_Hypergraphs","229265178_Polyhedral_consequences_of_the_amalgam_operation","228057841_Combinatorial_Problems_Exercises","226092907_Balanced_Matrices","225572783_Domination_of_undirected_graphs_-_A_survey","222628100_Domination_independent_domination_and_duality_in_strongly_chordal_graphs","222596702_Characterizations_of_strongly_chordal_graphs","222590411_Domination_in_permutation_graphs","222583694_Dominating_sets_for_split_and_bipartite_graphs","222280535_Dominating_sets_and_domatic_number_of_circular_arc_graphs","222265364_The_max-cut_problem_on_graphs_not_contractible_to_K5","222134940_Dominating_Sets_in_Perfect_Graphs","220589483_Characterization_of_stable_matchings_as_extreme_points_of_a_polytope","220532808_Domination_on_Cocomparability_Graphs","37411969_Composition_de_polytopes_combinatoires_une_approche_par_projection"]}
