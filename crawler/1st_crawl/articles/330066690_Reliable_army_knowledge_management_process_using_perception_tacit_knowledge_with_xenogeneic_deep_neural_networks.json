{"id":"330066690_Reliable_army_knowledge_management_process_using_perception_tacit_knowledge_with_xenogeneic_deep_neural_networks","abstract":"Knowledge management is the process of providing tacit knowledge for gathering and analysing data to perform particular examination in different applications such as soft-ware engineering, business industry, and education, military and so on. Among the various applications, reliability of the army management process is one of the major issues due to lack of details about particular commanding and training section. This paper introduces the reliable army knowledge management system by using the knowledge based machine learning approach. Initially, battle, training and commanding knowledgeable information’s are collected by using perception tacit knowledge process. The collected army knowledge’s are examined by applying the xenogeneic deep neural network which analyses the data by splitting different domains for making the developments in different knowledge process such as human resource analysis, army organisation, and their competitiveness. The collected knowledge information is used to improve the performance of army management.","authors":["P.R. Jasmine Jeni","Rajagopal Palson Kennedy","K.
