{"id":"326499893_Name_Disambiguation_in_AMiner_Clustering_Maintenance_and_Human_in_the_Loop","abstract":"AMiner 1 is a free online academic search and mining system, having collected more than 130,000,000 researcher profiles and over 200,000,000 papers from multiple publication databases [25].\nIn this paper, we present the implementation and deployment of name disambiguation , a core component in AMiner. The problem has been studied for decades but remains largely unsolved. In AMiner, we did a systemic investigation into the problem and propose a comprehensive framework to address the problem. We propose a novel representation learning method by incorporating both global and local information and present an end-to-end cluster size estimation method that is significantly better than traditional BIC-based method. To improve accuracy, we involve human annotators into the disambiguation process. We carefully evaluate the proposed framework on real-world large data and experimental results show that the proposed solution achieves clearly better performance (+7-35% in terms of F1-score) than several state-of-the-art methods including GHOST [5], Zhang et al. [33], and Louppe et al. [17].\nFinally, the algorithm has been deployed in AMiner to deal with the disambiguation problem at the billion scale, which further demonstrates both effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework.","authors":["Yutao Zhang","Fanjin Zhang","Peiran Yao","Jie Tang"],"meta":["July 2018","DOI:10.1145/3219819.3219859","Conference: the 24th ACM SIGKDD International Conference"],"references":["318946292_Name_Disambiguation_in_Anonymized_Graphs_using_Network_Embedding","307909293_Ethnicity_Sensitive_Author_Disambiguation_Using_Semi-supervised_Learning","286765883_Learning_deep_representations_for_graph_clustering","281427683_Ethnicity_sensitive_author_disambiguation_using_semi-supervised_learning","262177317_A_discriminative_hierarchical_model_for_fast_coreference_at_large_scale","257882504_Distributed_Representations_of_Words_and_Phrases_and_their_Compositionality","220965229_Object_Distinction_Distinguishing_Objects_with_Identical_Names","220874817_Large-Scale_Cross-Document_Coreference_Using_Distributed_Inference_and_Hierarchical_Models","220815486_Improving_Author_Coreference_by_Resource-Bounded_Information_Gathering_from_the_Web","220473677_Swoosh_A_generic_approach_to_entity_resolution","220345064_Collective_Entity_Resolution_In_Relational_Data","220282903_Collective_Entity_Resolution_In_Relational_Data","51986580_ArnetMiner_Extraction_and_Mining_of_Academic_Social_Networks","23660097_Integrated_network_analysis_platform_for_protein-protein_interactions","4092717_Two_supervised_learning_approaches_for_name_disambiguation_in_author_citations","2532744_X-means_Extending_K-means_with_Efficient_Estimation_of_the_Number_of_Clusters","345653527_Introduction_to_High-Dimensional_Statistics","311223228_Neural_Combinatorial_Optimization_with_Reinforcement_Learning","310671827_Variational_Graph_Auto-Encoders","307991731_Semi-Supervised_Classification_with_Graph_Convolutional_Networks","304552788_FaceNet_A_unified_embedding_for_face_recognition_and_clustering","299970706_COSNET","287457185_Canonicalizing_Open_Knowledge_Bases","273471270_FaceNet_A_Unified_Embedding_for_Face_Recognition_and_Clustering","263891726_A_Comparison_of_Blocking_Methods_for_Record_Linkage","262333265_Entity_disambiguation_in_anonymized_graphs_using_graph_kernels","232617537_A_Unified_Probabilistic_Framework_for_Name_Disambiguation_in_Digital_Library","227307467_A_Generalized_Birthday_Problem","221996415_The_Hungarian_Method_for_The_Assignment_Problem","221604749_Identification_and_Tracing_of_Ambiguous_Names_Discriminative_and_Generative_Approaches","221300954_Person_name_disambiguation_by_bootstrapping","221023670_Disambiguating_Web_appearances_of_people_in_a_social_network","220766777_GRAPE_A_Graph-Based_Framework_for_Disambiguating_People_Appearances_in_Web_Search","220699025_Efficient_Name_Disambiguation_for_Large-Scale_Databases","220345112_A_Combination_Approach_to_Web_User_Profiling","220177467_On_Graph-Based_Name_Disambiguation"]}
