{"id":"319770104_Deep_Learning_Requires_Rethinking_Generalization","abstract":"Despite their massive size, successful deep artificial neural networks can exhibit a remarkably small difference between training and test performance. Conventional wisdom attributes small generalization error either to properties of the model fam- ily, or to the regularization techniques used during training. Through extensive systematic experiments, we show how these traditional ap- proaches fail to explain why large neural networks generalize well in practice. Specifically, our experiments establish that state-of-the-art convolutional networks for image classification trained with stochastic gradient methods easily fit a ran- dom labeling of the training data. This phenomenon is qualitatively unaffected by explicit regularization, and occurs even if we replace the true images by com- pletely unstructured random noise. We corroborate these experimental findings with a theoretical construction showing that simple depth two neural networks al- ready have perfect finite sample expressivity as soon as the number of parameters exceeds the number of data points as it usually does in practice. We interpret our experimental findings by comparison with traditional models.","authors":["Chiyuan Zhang","Samy Bengio","Moritz Hardt","Benjamin Recht"],"meta":["November 2017","Conference: International Conference on Learning Representation"],"references":[]}
