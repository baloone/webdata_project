{"id":"327775069_A_Resilient-Sustainable_Based_Supplier_Selection_Model_Using_a_Hybrid_Intelligent_Method","abstract":"Supplier selection literature with contributing sustainability issues observes exponential growth in the number of publications. However, a few studies have focused on the more extensive effects of sustainability paradigm in the supplier selection that arise with disruptions. Hence, a tool is required to help purchasing managers to consider resilience and sustainability approaches in the supplier selection decision under disruption situation. This paper fulfills this necessity with proposing a resilient-sustainable framework based on the supplier selection indicators. Moreover, a fuzzy set theory is applied to cope with the uncertainty in the supplier selection decision. Furthermore, a modular Fuzzy Inference System is designed to calculate the affinity indices of suppliers to resiliency and sustainability issues. The modular FIS system supports to have a comprehensive supplier selection model with any number of indicators and suppliers. Then, the results of the proposed modular FIS are passed to an Assurance Region DEA method (AR-DEA) to determine the weights of indicators to rank the suppliers. The applicability of the proposed integrated intelligent model investigated by a real case. To show the effectiveness of the proposed model, sensitivity analysis has been adopted.","authors":["Atefeh Amindoust"],"meta":["December 2018Computers & Industrial Engineering 126:122-135","DOI:10.1016/j.cie.2018.09.031"],"references":["316525513_Supplier_selection_considering_sustainability_measures_An_application_of_weight_restriction_fuzzy-DEA_approach"]}
