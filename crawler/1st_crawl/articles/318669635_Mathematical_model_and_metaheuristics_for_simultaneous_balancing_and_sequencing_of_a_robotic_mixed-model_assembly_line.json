{"id":"318669635_Mathematical_model_and_metaheuristics_for_simultaneous_balancing_and_sequencing_of_a_robotic_mixed-model_assembly_line","abstract":"This article presents the first method to simultaneously balance and sequence robotic mixed-model assembly lines (RMALB/S), which involves three sub-problems: task assignment, model sequencing and robot allocation. A new mixed-integer programming model is developed to minimize makespan and, using CPLEX solver, small-size problems are solved for optimality. Two metaheuristics, the restarted simulated annealing algorithm and co-evolutionary algorithm, are developed and improved to address this NP-hard problem. The restarted simulated annealing method replaces the current temperature with a new temperature to restart the search process. The co-evolutionary method uses a restart mechanism to generate a new population by modifying several vectors simultaneously. The proposed algorithms are tested on a set of benchmark problems and compared with five other high-performing metaheuristics. The proposed algorithms outperform their original editions and the benchmarked methods. The proposed algorithms are able to solve the balancing and sequencing problem of a robotic mixed-model assembly line effectively and efficiently.","authors":["Zixiang Li","Mukund Nilakantan Janardhanan","Qiuhua Tang","Peter Nielsen"],"meta":["July 2017Engineering Optimization 50(4536426):1-17","DOI:10.1080/0305215X.2017.1351963"],"references":["308343829_Co-evolutionary_particle_swarm_optimization_algorithm_for_two-sided_robotic_assembly_line_balancing_problem","304612472_Minimizing_the_Cycle_Time_in_Two-Sided_Assembly_Lines_with_Assignment_Restrictions_Improvements_and_a_Simple_Algorithm","281336326_Hierarchical_approach_for_paced_mixed-model_assembly_line_balancing_and_sequencing_with_jolly_operators","278016789_Integrating_ant_colony_and_genetic_algorithms_in_the_balancing_and_scheduling_of_complex_assembly_lines","271797137_Literature_review_of_assembly_line_balancing_problems","270344207_Bio-inspired_search_algorithms_to_solve_robotic_assembly_line_balancing_problems","264910963_Mathematical_Model_and_Agent_Based_Solution_Approach_for_the_Simultaneous_Balancing_and_Sequencing_of_Mixed-Model_Parallel_Two-Sided_Assembly_Lines","259443193_Simultaneous_balancing_and_sequencing_of_mixed-model_parallel_two-sided_assembly_lines","257337318_Balancing_and_scheduling_of_flexible_mixed_model_assembly_lines_with_parallel_stations","232908591_Balancing_and_sequencing_of_parallel_mixed-model_assembly_lines","222562743_A_simple_and_effective_iterated_greedy_algorithm_for_the_permutation_flowshop_scheduling_problem","222164948_Two_new_robust_genetic_algorithms_for_the_flowshop_scheduling_problem","315887841_Multi-objective_co-operative_co-evolutionary_algorithm_for_minimizing_carbon_footprint_and_maximizing_line_efficiency_in_robotic_assembly_line_systems","308748459_Analysis_of_the_type_II_robotic_mixed-model_assembly_line_balancing_problem","304459773_Minimizing_energy_consumption_and_cycle_time_in_two-sided_robotic_assembly_line_systems_using_restarted_simulated_annealing_algorithm","303128545_Dynamic_Analysis_for_the_Cutting_Electromechanical_Transmission_System_in_the_Long-wall_Shearer","301915290_An_effective_discrete_artificial_bee_colony_algorithm_with_idle_time_reduction_techniques_for_two-sided_assembly_line_balancing_problem_of_type-II","294103545_Multi-objective_metaheuristics_for_solving_a_type_II_robotic_mixed-model_assembly_line_balancing_problem","277669443_Cyclic_scheduling_of_flexible_mixed_model_assembly_lines","272379219_A_new_multi-objective_approach_in_order_to_balancing_and_sequencing_U-shaped_mixed_model_assembly_line_problem_a_proposed_heuristic_algorithm","272101665_An_investigation_on_minimizing_cycle_time_and_total_energy_consumption_in_robotic_assembly_line_systems","272031232_Balancing_of_robotic_mixed-model_two-sided_assembly_line_with_robot_setup_times","271821603_A_novel_bi-level_hierarchy_towards_available-to-promise_in_mixed-model_assembly_line_sequencing_problems","271721755_Robotic_U-shaped_assembly_line_balancing_using_particle_swarm_optimization","267810996_Multi-objective_artificial_bee_colony_algorithm_for_simultaneous_sequencing_and_balancing_of_mixed_model_assembly_line","264428924_Advanced_scatter_search_approach_and_its_application_in_a_sequencing_problem_of_mixed-model_assembly_lines_in_a_case_company","263244899_Performance_evaluation_of_ant_colony_optimization-based_solution_strategies_on_the_mixed-model_assembly_line_balancing_problem","263197208_Balancing_and_sequencing_mixed-model_U-lines_with_a_co-evolutionary_algorithm","259911678_A_simulated_annealing_algorithm_based_approach_for_balancing_and_sequencing_of_mixed-model_U-lines","257635786_Simultaneous_solving_of_balancing_and_sequencing_problems_with_station-dependent_assembly_times_for_mixed-model_assembly_lines","246044850_Type_II_robotic_assembly_line_balancing_problem_An_evolution_strategies_algorithm_for_a_multi-objective_model","238355667_The_Use_of_Ranks_to_Avoid_the_Assumption_of_Normality_Implicit_in_the_Analysis_of_Variance","226849214_Balancing-sequencing_procedure_for_a_mixed_model_assembly_system_in_case_of_finite_buffer_capacity","226229993_An_approach_for_balancing_and_sequencing_mixed-model_JIT_U-lines","223891888_An_endosymbiotic_evolutionary_algorithm_for_the_integration_of_balancing_and_sequencing_in_mixed-model_U-lines","223787392_Balancing_and_sequencing_mixed-model_just-in-time_U-lines_with_multiple_objectives","222823435_Abstract_A_genetic_algorithm_for_robotic_assembly_line_balancing","222741462_RALB_-_A_Heuristic_Algorithm_for_Design_and_Balancing_of_Robotic_Assembly_Lines","220384586_A_genetic_algorithm_based_approach_for_simultaneously_balancing_and_sequencing_of_mixed-model_U-lines_with_parallel_workstations_and_zoning_constraints","220384267_An_efficient_approach_for_type_II_robotic_assembly_line_balancing_problems","220204835_A_Coevolutionary_Algorithm_for_Balancing_and_Sequencing_in_Mixed_Model_Assembly_Lines"]}
