{"id":"233753224_Theano_new_features_and_speed_improvements","abstract":"Theano is a linear algebra compiler that optimizes a user's\nsymbolically-specified mathematical computations to produce efficient low-level\nimplementations. In this paper, we present new features and efficiency\nimprovements to Theano, and benchmarks demonstrating Theano's performance\nrelative to Torch7, a recently introduced machine learning library, and to\nRNNLM, a C++ library targeted at recurrent neural networks.","authors":["Frederic Bastien","Pascal Lamblin","Razvan Pascanu","James Bergstra"],"meta":["November 2012","SourcearXiv"],"references":["3422935_Python_for_Scientific_Computing","319770411_Torch7_A_Matlab-like_Environment_for_Machine_Learning","303256841_Theano_a_CPU_and_GPU_math_expression_compiler","264890087_Torch7_A_Matlab-like_Environment_for_Machine_Learning","243743707_Learning_Internal_Representations_by_Error_Propagation","230876435_Learning_Internal_Representation_by_Error_Propagation","221480736_Empirical_Evaluation_and_Combination_of_Advanced_Language_Modeling_Techniques","221344668_Learning_Recurrent_Neural_Networks_with_Hessian-Free_Optimization","213877848_SciPy_Open_Source_Scientific_Tools_for_Python","3422938_IPython_A_System_for_Interactive_Scientific_Computing"]}
