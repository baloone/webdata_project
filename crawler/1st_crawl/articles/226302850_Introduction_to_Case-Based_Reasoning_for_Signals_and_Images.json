{"id":"226302850_Introduction_to_Case-Based_Reasoning_for_Signals_and_Images","abstract":"Case-based reasoning (CBR) is used when generalized knowledge is lacking. The method works on a set of cases formerly processed\nand stored in the case base. A new case is interpreted based on its similarity to cases in the case base. The closest case\nwith its associated result is selected and presented as output of the system. Signal-interpreting systems for 1-d, 2-d, or\n3-dimensional signals are becoming increasingly popular in medical and industrial applications. New strategies are necessary\nthat can adapt to changing environmental conditions, user needs, and process requirements. Introducing CBR strategies into\nsignal-interpreting systems can satisfy these requirements. We describe in this chapter the basics of CBR and review what\nhas been done so far in the field of signal-interpreting systems.","authors":["Petra Perner"],"meta":["April 2008","DOI:10.1007/978-3-540-73180-1_1","In book: Case-Based Reasoning on Images and Signals (pp.1-24)"],"references":["250171630_Optical_character_recognition_an_illustrated_guide_to_the_frontier","249736455_A_Comparative_Study_of_String_Dissimilarity_Measures_in_Structural_Clustering","346670705_From_global_similarities_to_kinds_of_similarities_the_construction_of_dimensions_in_development","321596599_Performance_Characterization_in_Computer_Vision","317219448_The_life_cycle_of_test_cases_in_a_CBR_system","312977263_IEEE_Transactions_on_Pattern_Analysis_and_Machine_Intelligence","285741523_Feature_similarity","263155818_A_New_Metric_for_Grey-Scale_Image_Comparison","262406830_Dissimilarity_Representation_of_Images_for_Relevance_Feedback_in_Content-Based_Image_Retrieval","244186114_Using_CBR_Learning_for_the_Low-Level_and_High-Level_Unit_of_a_Image_Interpretation_System","239667269_A_rule-rule-case_based_system_for_image_analysis","239060720_From_Global_Similarities_to_Kinds_of_Similarities-The_Construction_of_Dimensions_in_Development","236626861_Quadratic_Convergence_in_a_Primal-Dual_Method","227308620_An_introduction_to_case-based_reasoning","226877478_CBR_for_the_Reuse_of_Image_Processing_Knowledge_a_Recursive_RetrievalAdaptation_Strategy"]}
