As a process of knowledge discovery. Classification is a data analysis that extracts a model which describes an important data classes. One of the outstanding classifications methods in data mining is support vector machine classification (SVM). It is capable of envisaging results and mostly effective than other classification methods. The SVM is a one technique of machine learning techniques that is well known technique, learning with supervised and have been applied perfectly to a vary problems of: regression, classification, and clustering in diverse domains such as gene expression, web text mining. In this study, we proposed a newly mode for classifying iris data set using SVM classifier and genetic algorithm to optimize c and gamma parameters of linear SVM, in addition principle components analysis (PCA) algorithm was use for features reduction.","authors":["Zahraa Faiz Hussain","Hind Raad Ibraheem","Mohammad Aljanabi","Ahmed Hussein Ali"],"meta":["February 2020International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering 10(1):1079","DOI:10.11591/ijece.v10i1.pp1079-1084","Project: How to connect Radoop (rapidMiner) to Hadoop"],"references":["339413163_An_Efficient_Model_for_Data_Classification_Based_on_SVM_Grid_Parameter_Optimization_and_PSO_Feature_Weight_Selection","336678115_A_Survey_on_Vertical_and_Horizontal_Scaling_Platforms_for_Big_Data_Analytics","332247376_A_cluster-based_feature_selection_method_for_image_texture_classification","327992933_Newton_Competitive_Genetic_Algorithm_Method_for_Optimization_the_Production_of_Biochemical_Systems","326837104_Contact_Lens_Classification_by_Using_Segmented_Lens_Boundary_Features","325700387_Optimisation_of_Biochemical_Systems_Production_using_Hybrid_of_Newton_Method_Differential_Evolution_Algorithm_and_Cooperative_Coevolution_Algorithm","320130325_Multi-objective_Optimization_of_Biochemical_System_Production_Using_an_Improve_Newton_Competitive_Differential_Evolution_Method","320872395_Feature_Selection_and_Radial_Basis_Function_Network_for_Parkinson_Disease_Classification","320744118_A_Study_on_Facial_Expression_Recognition_Using_Local_Binary_Pattern","320130149_A_Comparative_Study_of_Different_Template_Matching_Techniques_for_Twin_Iris_Recognition"]}
