{"id":"279633409_Statistical_Inference_using_the_Morse-Smale_Complex","abstract":"The Morse-Smale complex decomposes the sample space into cells where a given\nfunction $f$ is increasing or decreasing. When applied to nonparametric density\nestimation and regression, it provides a way to represent, visualize and\ncompare functions, even in high dimensions. In this paper, we study the\nestimation of the Morse-Smale complex and we use our results for a variety of\nstatistical problems including: nonparametric two-sample testing, density\nestimation, nonparametric regression and mode clustering.","authors":["Yen-Chi Chen","Christopher R.
