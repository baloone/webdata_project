{"id":"332875587_Integrated_and_Secure_Web-Based_Examination_Management_System","abstract":"A web-based examination management system that is implemented in-house is discussed in this paper. It is designed based on the Java enterprise edition three-tier architecture. It also allows defining and setting up exams according to a flexible tree-based exams structure. Moreover, it integrates a rich text editor for composing exams suitable for different engineering and language disciplines. In addition, it automates the scheduling, grading and reporting processes in order to relieve instructors from such cumbersome tasks. Furthermore, its capabilities and integration with different databases enable it to offer several security schemes that support strong multifactor authentication and authorization, detect impersonation and prevent cheating. Besides, it provides an easy to use and informative wizard that enables students to take exams. Not to mention, the deployment results illustrate that the system has been successfully used to organize online exams in several semesters over the past three academic years. Finally, the conducted user surveys responses assert that the system is also user friendly, cutting edge, capable, reliable, fast and highly available.","authors":["Feras Al-hawari","Mai Alshawabkeh","Haytham Althawbih","Omar Abu Nawas"],"meta":["May 2019Computer Applications in Engineering Education","DOI:10.1002/cae.9","Project: Analysis and Design of Web-Based Systems to Manage Student Information"],"references":["329544515_Towards_authentic_e-Exams_at_scale_robust_networked_Moodle","320774436_A_practical_three-phase_ILP_approach_for_solving_the_examination_timetabling_problem","318060618_Analysis_and_Design_of_an_Accounting_Information_System","316600734_Developing_a_New_e-Exam_Platform_to_Enhance_the_University_Academic_Examinations_the_Case_of_Lebanese_French_University","327620158_Development_and_implementation_of_a_tablet-based_exam_app_for_engineering_courses","322055334_Privacy_and_Security_in_Online_Examination_Systems","320743090_Secure_online_examination_by_using_graphical_own_image_password_scheme","320029553_OAES_Scalable_and_Secure_Architecture_for_Online_Assessment_and_Evaluation_System","316807275_JavaServer_Faces","316800105_Introducing_Java_EE_7","313540124_The_software_engineering_of_a_three-tier_web-based_student_information_system_MyGJU","313160381_MyGJU_Student_View_and_its_Online_and_Preventive_Registration_Flow","312037507_Ensuring_Online_Exam_Integrity_Through_Continuous_Biometric_Authentication","304457136_Online_automatic_examination_system_for_digital_circuits","303711405_Transition_from_traditional_to_LMS_supported_examining_A_case_study_in_computer_engineering_A_CASE_STUDY_IN_COMPUTER_ENGINEERING"]}
