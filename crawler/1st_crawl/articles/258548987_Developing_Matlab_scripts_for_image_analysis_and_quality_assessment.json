{"id":"258548987_Developing_Matlab_scripts_for_image_analysis_and_quality_assessment","abstract":"Image processing is a very helpful tool in many fields of modern\nsciences that involve digital imaging examination and interpretation.\nProcessed images however, often need to be correlated with the original\nimage, in order to ensure that the resulting image fulfills its purpose.\nAside from the visual examination, which is mandatory, image quality\nindices (such as correlation coefficient, entropy and others) are very\nuseful, when deciding which processed image is the most satisfactory.\nFor this reason, a single program (script) was written in Matlab\nlanguage, which automatically calculates eight indices by utilizing\neight respective functions (independent function scripts). The program\nwas tested in both fused hyperspectral (Hyperion-ALI) and multispectral\n(ALI, Landsat) imagery and proved to be efficient. Indices were found to\nbe in agreement with visual examination and statistical observations.","authors":["A. D.
