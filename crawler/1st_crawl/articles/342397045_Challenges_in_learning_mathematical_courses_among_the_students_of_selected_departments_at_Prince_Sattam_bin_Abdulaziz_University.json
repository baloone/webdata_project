For this research, the referendum was not limited to students of the mathematics department only, but also included the departments of Computer Science and Business Administration, because their study plan contains basic courses in mathematical science, and it is hoped that the results of the completion of the survey will support decision-makers and teachers of courses in improving and diversifying the learning of mathematical content. This enhances the learning goals that the students achieve.","authors":["Salman Sahud Alotaibi","Bushra Elamin"],"meta":["June 2020"],"references":["259669422_The_Roles_of_Mathematics_in_Computer_Science","30969544_Are_There_Genuine_Mathematical_Explanations_of_Physical_Phenomena","320849398_Student_perspectives_on_mathematics_in_computer_science","268209413_Mathematics_Explanation_and_Scientific_Knowledge","229451140_A_Role_for_Mathematics_in_the_Physical_Sciences","36445163_On_the_Explanatory_Role_of_Mathematics_in_Empirical_Science"]}
