{"id":"220779939_Approximating_the_Spanning_Star_Forest_Problem_and_Its_Applications_to_Genomic_Sequence_Alignment","abstract":"This paper studies the algorithmic issues of the span- ning star forest problem. We prove the following re- sults: (1) there is a polynomial-time approximation scheme for planar unweighted graphs; (2) there is a polynomial-time algorithm with approximation ratio 35 for unweighted graphs; (3) it is NP-hard to approxi- mate the problem within ratio 545 546 + for unweighted graphs; (4) there is a linear-time algorithm to compute the maximum star forest of a weighted tree; (5) there is a polynomial-time algorithm with approximation ratio 1 2 for weighted graphs. We also show how to apply this spanning star forest model to aligning multiple genomic sequences over a tandem duplication region.","authors":["C.
