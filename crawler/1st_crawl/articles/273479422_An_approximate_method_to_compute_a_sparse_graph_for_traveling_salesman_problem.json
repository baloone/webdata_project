{"id":"273479422_An_approximate_method_to_compute_a_sparse_graph_for_traveling_salesman_problem","abstract":"It is well known that traveling salesman problem has the exp( ) time complexity in most cases. The exponential base will be reduced with the bounded degree graphs. The number of Hamiltonian cycles is approximately computed as for a n-vertex graph of average degree , where e is the base of natural logarithm. It is much smaller than the total number of Hamiltonian cycles (n − 1)!/2 in a complete undirected graph. An approximate method to compute a sparse graph is introduced to decrease the search space of the optimal solution. Firstly, a set of optimal k-vertex paths are computed with a weighted graph. Secondly, a frequency graph is computed with the set of optimal k-vertex paths. The frequency graph maintains the topological structure of the weighted graph whereas the numbers on the edges represent the frequencies of edges enumerated form the set of optimal k-vertex paths. Thirdly, a frequency threshold is deduced to remove the edges with frequencies below it and the sparse graph is generated. The bounded degree of the sparse graph is much smaller than n − 1 and the complexity of traveling salesman problem is reduced. The approximate method is verified with tens of Euclidean TSP instances.","authors":["Yong Wang"],"meta":["March 2015Expert Systems with Applications 42(12)","DOI:10.1016/j.eswa.2015.02.037"],"references":["225493761_Implementing_the_Dantzig-Fulkerson-Johnson_algorithm_for_large_traveling_salesman_problems","318781000_Finding_the_Right_Cutting_Planes_for_the_TSP","269302820_A_Representation_Model_for_TSP","268645053_The_Traveling_Salesman_Problem_A_Computational_Study","225169879_The_Traveling_Salesman_Problem_in_Bounded_Degree_Graphs","223559678_A_classification_of_formulations_for_the_time-dependent_traveling_salesman_problem","222666128_Which_Problems_Have_Strongly_Exponential_Complexity","222647825_A_comparison_of_lower_bounds_for_the_symmetric_circulant_traveling_salesman_problem","220779197_On_the_Number_of_Crossing-Free_Matchings_Cycles_and_Partitions","220668826_TSPLIB_A_traveling_salesman_problem_library","220390608_Combinatorial_Dominance_Guarantees_for_Problems_with_Infeasible_Solutions","220060070_Certification_of_an_optimal_TSP_tour_through_85900_cities","2746536_Finding_the_Right_Cutting_Planes_for_the_TSP","1956322_The_Traveling_Salesman_Problem_for_Cubic_Graphs"]}
