{"id":"21897496_Sex_Differences_in_Cognition_A_Function_of_Maturation_Rate","abstract":"Regardless of sex, early maturing adolescents performed better on tests of verbal than spatial abilities, the late maturing ones showed the opposite pattern. Those maturing late were more lateralized for speech than those maturing early. Sex differences in mental abilities, it is argued, reflect differences in the organization of cortical function that are related to differential rates of physical maturation.","authors":["Deborah P.
