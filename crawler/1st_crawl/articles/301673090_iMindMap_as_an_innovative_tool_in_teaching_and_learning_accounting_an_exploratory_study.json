Students could find that learning is an exciting experience and were able to visualize the whole course content remarkably via iMindMap.\n\nOriginality/value\nThis study presents an alternative instrument, which is innovative and interactive in teaching and learning, especially for accounting students where the studentsâ€™ technology acceptance could also be viewed.","authors":["Wan Noor Hazlina Wan Jusoh","Suraya Ahmad"],"meta":["April 2016Interactive Technology and Smart Education 13(1):71-82","DOI:10.1108/ITSE-05-2015-0012","Project: iMindMap"],"references":["347306546_Innovative_Methods_of_Teaching","306176628_Mind_maps_as_active_learning_tools","301955344_Application_of_Mind_Maps_and_Mind_Manager_to_Improve_Students'_Competence_in_Solving_Chemistry_Problems","299157689_Technology_for_everyone_Mind_mapping_complex_information","287229656_Cognitive_Mapping_Techniques_Implications_for_Research_in_Engineering_and_Technology_Education","283666087_Effect_of_Using_the_Electronic_Mind_Map_in_the_Educational_Research_Methodology_Course_for_Master-Degree_Students_in_the_Faculty_of_Education","279868129_Listen_to_the_Natives","265092376_Educating_the_Net_Generation","243778926_Growing_Up_Digital_The_Rise_of_the_Net_Generation","242541587_Understanding_Digital_Children_DKs_Teaching_Learning_in_the_New_Digital_Landscape","242336149_Mind_mapping_in_executive_education_Applications_and_outcomes","239603833_Using_multimedia_in_teaching_Islamic_studies","242116064_Reaching_and_Teaching_the_Digital_Natives","240282737_Mind_Map_Marketing_A_Creative_Approach_in_Developing_Marketing_Skills","237714222_H_Sapiens_Digital_From_Digital_Immigrants_and_Digital_Natives_to_Digital_Wisdom"]}
