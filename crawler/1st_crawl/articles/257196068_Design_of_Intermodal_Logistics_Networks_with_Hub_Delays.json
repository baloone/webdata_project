{"id":"257196068_Design_of_Intermodal_Logistics_Networks_with_Hub_Delays","abstract":"In an intermodal hub network, cost benefits can be achieved through the use of intermodal shipments and the economies of scale due to consolidation of flows at the hubs. However, due to limited resources at the logistics hubs, shipment delays may affect the service performance. In this research hub operations are modeled as a GI/G/1 queuing network and the shipments as multiple job classes with deterministic routings. By integrating the hub operation queuing model and the hub location-allocation model, the effect of limited hub resources on the design of intermodal logistics networks under service time requirements is investigated. The managerial insights gained from a study of 25-city road-rail intermodal logistics network show that the level of available hub resources significantly affects the logistics network structure in terms of number and location of hubs, total network costs, choice of single-hub and inter-hub shipments and service performance.","authors":["Rafay Ishfaq","Charles R.
