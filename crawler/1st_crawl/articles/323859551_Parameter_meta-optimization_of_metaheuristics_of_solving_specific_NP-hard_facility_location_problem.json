{"id":"323859551_Parameter_meta-optimization_of_metaheuristics_of_solving_specific_NP-hard_facility_location_problem","abstract":"The aim of the work is to create an evolutionary method for optimizing the values of the control parameters of metaheuristics of solving the NP-hard facility location problem. A system analysis of the tuning process of optimization algorithms parameters is carried out. The problem of finding the parameters of a metaheuristic algorithm is formulated as a meta-optimization problem. Evolutionary metaheuristic has been chosen to perform the task of meta-optimization. Thus, the approach proposed in this work can be called \"meta-metaheuristic\". Computational experiment proving the effectiveness of the procedure of tuning the control parameters of metaheuristics has been performed.","authors":["E S Skakov","Vladimir Malysh"],"meta":["March 2018Journal of Physics Conference Series 973(1):012063","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/973/1/012063"],"references":["308953674_Ant_Colony_Optimization","277474071_Tabu_search-part_II","276387288_Bee_Colony_Optimization_-_part_I_The_algorithm_overview","270380187_Bee_Colony_Optimization_-_part_II_The_application_survey","263910580_Computing_with_Bees_Attacking_Complex_Transportation_Engineering_Problems","304850133_Metaheuristics_for_Hard_Optimization_Methods_and_Case_Studies","296757705_Search_Engine_Optimization","272040980_A_GA-based_feature_selection_and_parameter_optimization_of_an_ANN_in_diagnosing_breast_cancer","266749644_Tuning_the_parameters_of_an_integrate_and_fire_neuron_via_a_genetic_algorithm_for_solving_pattern_recognition_problems","257196469_Multi-start_methods_for_combinatorial_optimization"]}
