{"id":"267468193_Coloring_algorithms_for_dynamical_systems_in_the_complex_plane","abstract":"With the increasing complexity of fractal generation software, the focus of exploration in new fractal techniques is shifting away from fractal formulas and towards coloring algorithms. This paper provides an overview of the coloring algorithms in popular use and a general classification system for these techniques.","authors":["Javier Barrallo","Damien M.
