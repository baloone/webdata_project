{"id":"326269312_An_accurate_assessment_tool_based_on_intelligent_technique_for_suitability_of_soybean_cropland_case_study_in_Kebumen_Regency_Indonesia","abstract":"In the last few years, the decrease in the land use of soybean aﬀected the reduced of\nsoybean production. Land suitability assessment is an eﬀort to increase the soybean\nproduction since the manual method was less accurate. This study aims to apply\nfuzzy sets and AHP to improve the accuracy of the assessment process of land\nsuitability for soybean crops. The value of ﬁve sub-criteria converted into fuzzy\nsets for standardization process. The weighting by AHP performed to determine\nthe importance level of sub-criteria. Suitability index and ﬁnal land suitability\nclasses were obtained from the calculation of the fuzzy membership function\nvalues and the weights of each sub-criteria before being overlaid with spatial\ndata to produce land suitability map for soybeans. The results of this work\nshowed that 81.42% of the total area was moderate suitability (S2), 11.25% was\nmarginally suitable (S3) and of 7.33% was not suitable (N). From the results of\nland suitability assessment for soybean crops has been tested and has good\ncorrelation with the yield conditions. This study showed that the proposed tool\nbased on Fuzzy sets and AHP were accurate to assess the land suitability of soybean and can be used as the basis for agricultural planning to optimize the land\nuse and soybean production.","authors":["Subiyanto Subiyanto","Hermanto Hermanto","Ulfah Mediaty Arief","Ahmad Yazidun Nafi"],"meta":["July 2018Heliyon 4(7):e00684","DOI:10.1016/j.heliyon.2018.e00684","Project: Department of Electrical Engineering"],"references":["322094883_A_Rule_Based_Classification_for_Vegetable_Production_Using_Rough_Set_and_Genetic_Algorithm","321797093_Land_Suitability_Analysis_for_Rice_Production_A_GIS_Based_Multi-Criteria_Decision_Approach","315907150_Crop_suitability_prediction_in_Vellore_District_using_rough_set_on_fuzzy_approximation_space_and_neural_network","311478651_Combination_of_Fuzzy_Logic_and_Analytical_Hierarchy_Process_Techniques_to_Assess_Potassium_Saturation_Percentage_of_Some_Calcareous_Soils_Case_Study_Fars_Province_Southern_Iran","306276278_Solar_Farm_Suitability_Using_Geographic_Information_System_Fuzzy_Sets_and_Analytic_Hierarchy_Processes_Case_Study_of_Ulleung_Island_Korea","305818268_Assessing_the_Suitability_and_Availability_of_Land_for_Agriculture_in_Tuban_Regency_East_Java_Indonesia","303182244_Evaluating_transit_operator_efficiency_An_enhanced_DEA_model_with_constrained_fuzzy-AHP_cones","301893485_Development_of_a_land_suitability_model_for_saffron_Crocus_sativus_L_cultivation_in_Khost_Province_of_Afghanistan_using_GIS_and_AHP_techniques_vol_62_pg_921_2015","299470365_Site_suitability_analysis_for_agricultural_land_use_of_Darjeeling_district_using_AHP_and_GIS_techniques","303845545_Land_suitability_evaluation_criteria_for_agricultural_crop_selection_A_review"]}
