Several related inequalities are deduced and investigated. New\nSimpson's type inequalities for $\\mathcal{RS}$--integral are pointed out.\nFinally, as application; an error estimation of a general quadrature rule for\n$\\mathcal{RS}$--integral via Ostrowski--generalized trapezoid quadrature\nformula is given.","authors":["Mohammad W.
