{"id":"273695434_Evaluation_of_Code_Inspection_on_an_Outsourced_Software_Project_in_Mauritius","abstract":"Software inspection is a proven methodology that enables the detection and removal of defects in software artifacts and thus contributes towards software quality assurance. It eventually leads to significant budget and time benefits. To be most effective, inspections must be an integral part of the software development life cycle and form part of the development schedule. This study considers code inspection as it is the most frequently used inspection in the software development process. For the implementation part of this research, code inspection is carried out in a selected outsourced project in a company situated in Mauritius, and the results are evaluated based on the inspection process and feedback of people involved in the inspection process.","authors":["Geshwaree Huzooree","Vimla Devi Ramdoo"],"meta":["March 2015International Journal of Computer Applications 113(10):975-8887","DOI:10.5120/19864-1827"],"references":["266657830_The_impact_of_code_review_coverage_and_code_review_participation_on_Software_quality_A_case_study_of_the_Qt_VTK_and_ITK_projects","260648765_A_Large-Scale_Empirical_Study_of_Just-in-Time_Quality_Assurance","244084882_Seven_Truths_About_Peer_Reviews_1","224101964_Design_and_Code_Inspections_to_Reduce_Errors_in_Program_Development","3248209_Source_code_review_systems","3246962_Managing_code_inspection_information"]}
