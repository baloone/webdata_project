{"id":"269033692_Fast_arithmetic_for_triangular_sets_From_theory_to_practice","abstract":"We study arithmetic operations for triangular families of polynomials, concentrating on multiplication in dimension zero. By a suitable extension of fast univariate Euclidean division, we obtain theoretical and practical improvements over a direct recursive approach; for a family of special cases, we reach quasi-linear complexity. The main outcome we have in mind is the acceleration of higher-level algorithms, by interfacing our low-level implementation with languages such as AXIOM or Maple We show the potential for huge speed-ups, by comparing two AXIOM implementations of van Hoeij and Monagan's modular GCD algorithm.","authors":["Xin Li","Marc Moreno Maza","Ã‰ric Schost"],"meta":["January 2007","DOI:10.1145/1277548.1277585","Sourcedoi.acm.org","Conference: the 2007 international symposium"],"references":["266595082_On_the_Minimum_Computation_Time_of_Functions","265439907_On27799_complexity_for_n_n_approximate_matrix_multiplication","264945958_Modern_Computer_Algebra","251396811_An_algorithm_for_division_of_powerseries","247442902_Introduction_To_Algorithms","243119758_Modular_Multiplication_Without_Trial_Division","242788267_The_RegularChains_library_in_MAPLE","239539482_On_Triangular_Decompositions_of_Algebraic_Varieties","227302813_Schnelle_Multiplikation_grosser_Zahlen","227113668_On_computing_reciprocals_of_power_series","225697897_Relations_between_exact_and_approximate_bilinear_algorithms_Applications","221564907_A_Modular_GCD_algorithm_over_Number_Fields_presented_with_Multiple_Extensions","221564880_High-performance_implementations_of_the_Descartes_method","226117369_Schnelle_Multiplikation_von_Polynomen_ber_Krpern_der_Charakteristik_2","222497057_A_New_Polynomial_Factorization_Algorithm_and_its_Implementation"]}
