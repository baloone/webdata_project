{"id":"257717161_Java_Programming_Assessment_Tool_for_Assignment_Module_in_Moodle_E-learning_System","abstract":"This paper proposes an intermediate system called JAssess which is developed to provide a handy way to manage submission of students’ Java programming exercises from MoodleTM, as well as grading them semi-automatically. Details about the proposed system and the algorithm that lay behind it is explain. It presents the major methods used while evaluating the Java programming assignment and how to overcome the different environment used in JAssess and MoodleTM. A few test samples are included. Results show that the proposed model is able to display the suggested mark along with the output for every successful compilation, and will display the error along with the suggested mark for every failed compilation. Some limitations of the system and suggestions for future works section was conclude in this paper.","authors":["Norazah Yusof","Nur Ariffin Mohd Zin","Noor Shyahira Adnan"],"meta":["October 2012Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences 56:767–773","DOI:10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.09.714","Project: Learning Analytics"],"references":["220832207_Static_Analysis_of_Students'_Java_Programs","220807180_Extending_moodle_to_better_support_computing_education","234775595_Automatic_graders_for_programming_classes","224245071_A_comparative_study_of_moodle_with_other_e-learning_systems","221537610_The_TRY_System_-_or_-_How_to_Avoid_Testing_Student_Programs","220807159_Web-CAT_automatically_grading_programming_assignments","220694938_Using_Moodle_-_teaching_with_the_popular_open_source_course_management_system_2_ed"]}
