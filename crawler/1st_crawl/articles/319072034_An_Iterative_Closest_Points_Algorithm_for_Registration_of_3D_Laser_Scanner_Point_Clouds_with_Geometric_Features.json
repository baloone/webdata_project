{"id":"319072034_An_Iterative_Closest_Points_Algorithm_for_Registration_of_3D_Laser_Scanner_Point_Clouds_with_Geometric_Features","abstract":"The Iterative Closest Points (ICP) algorithm is the mainstream algorithm used in the process of accurate registration of 3D point cloud data. The algorithm requires a proper initial value and the approximate registration of two point clouds to prevent the algorithm from falling into local extremes, but in the actual point cloud matching process, it is difficult to ensure compliance with this requirement. In this paper, we proposed the ICP algorithm based on point cloud features (GF-ICP). This method uses the geometrical features of the point cloud to be registered, such as curvature, surface normal and point cloud density, to search for the correspondence relationships between two point clouds and introduces the geometric features into the error function to realize the accurate registration of two point clouds. The experimental results showed that the algorithm can improve the convergence speed and the interval of convergence without setting a proper initial value.","authors":["Ying He","Bin Liang","Jun Yang","Shunzhi Li"],"meta":["August 2017Sensors 17(8):1862","DOI:10.3390/s17081862"],"references":["276473830_A_New_Method_for_Registration_of_3D_Point_Sets_with_Low_Overlapping_Ratios","266236575_Hue-assisted_automatic_registration_of_color_point_clouds","312919746_Efficient_simplification_of_point-sampled_surfaces","311621098_An_Improvement_of_Affine_Iterative_Closest_Point_Algorithm_for_Partial_Registration","310489483_3D_reconstruction_of_tongue_based_on_binocular_stereo","309275751_Non-rigid_registration_of_3D_point_clouds_under_isometric_deformation","301943560_An_Improved_Iterative_Closest_Point_Algorithm_Using_Clustering","298275756_Fast_global_registration_of_multiple_3D_data_sets_from_outdoor_large_scenes","273561373_Feature-constrained_registration_of_building_point_clouds_acquired_by_terrestrial_and_airborne_laser_scanners","262569253_LieTrICP_An_improvement_of_trimmed_iterative_closest_point_algorithm"]}
