(2019). « Digital writing: philosophical and pedagogical issues », Electronic Book Review, octobre 2019, http://electronicbookreview.com/essay/digital-writing-philosophical-and-pedagogical-issues/ -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Bouchardon and Petit defend the concept of digital writing and the teaching thereof. We can accept that digital writing exists, with its specific properties and tensions, but can it be taught? Specifically, the pedagogical dimension of what is known as \"digital\" writing, the authors argue, would do well to follow a study on the relationship between writing and computer science that was sponsored by the Picardy region : PRECIP, PRatiques d'ÉCriture Interactive en Picardie (interactive writing practices in Picardy).","authors":["Serge Bouchardon","Victor Petit"],"meta":["October 2019","DOI:10.7273/xkjp-rk21","Project: PRECIP (http://precip.fr)"],"references":["285446182_Digital_Scholarship_and_Digital_Studies_The_State_of_the_Discipline","281885198_Le_sens_de_la_technique_le_numerique_et_le_calcul","233448738_New_Materialism_as_Media_Theory_Medianatures_and_Dirty_Matter","220434591_Fundamental_forms_of_information","202187454_Du_Mode_d'Existence_des_Objets_Techniques","43800311_Du_signe_a_la_trace_l'information_sur_mesure"]}
