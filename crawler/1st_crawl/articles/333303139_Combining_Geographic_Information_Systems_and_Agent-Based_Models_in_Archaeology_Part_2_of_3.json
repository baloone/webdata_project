{"id":"333303139_Combining_Geographic_Information_Systems_and_Agent-Based_Models_in_Archaeology_Part_2_of_3","abstract":"Archaeologists are using spatial data in increasingly sophisticated analyses and invoking more explicit considerations of space in their interpretations. Geographic information systems (GIS) have become standard technology for professional archaeologists in the collection and management of spatial data. Many calls have been made to develop and adapt digital geospatial technologies for interpretation and understanding past social dynamics, but this has been limited to some extent by the static nature of map-oriented GIS approaches. Here, we illustrate how coupling GIS with agent-based modeling (ABM) can assist with more dynamic explorations of past uses of space and geospatial phenomena.","authors":["Benjamin Davies","Iza Romanowska","Kathryn Harris","Stefani A.
