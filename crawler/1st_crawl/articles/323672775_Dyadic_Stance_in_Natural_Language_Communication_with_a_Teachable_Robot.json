{"id":"323672775_Dyadic_Stance_in_Natural_Language_Communication_with_a_Teachable_Robot","abstract":"Learning companion robots can provide personalized learning interactions to engage students in many domains including STEM. For successful interactions, students must feel comfortable and engaged. We describe an experiment with a learning companion robot acting as a teachable robot; based on human-to-human peer tutoring, students teach the robot how to solve math problems. We compare student attitudes of comfort, attention, engagement, motivation, and physical proximity for two dyadic stance formations: a face-to-face stance and a side-by-side stance. In human-robot interaction experiments, it is common for dyads to assume a face-to-face stance, while in human-to-human peer tutoring, it is common for dyads to sit in side-by-side as well as face-to-face formations. We find that students in the face-to-face stance report stronger feelings of comfort and attention, compared to students in the side-by-side stance. We find no difference between stances for feelings of engagement, motivation, and physical proximity.","authors":["Tricia Chaffey","Hyeji Kim","Emilia Nobrega","Nichola Lubold"],"meta":["March 2018","DOI:10.1145/3173386.3176979","Conference: Companion of the 2018 ACM/IEEE International Conference"],"references":["310500415_Child-robot_spatial_arrangement_in_a_learning_by_teaching_activity","225723833_Measurement_Instruments_for_the_Anthropomorphism_Animacy_Likeability_Perceived_Intelligence_and_Perceived_Safety_of_Robots","221413709_Socially_Capable_Conversational_Tutors_Can_Be_Effective_in_Collaborative_Learning_Situations","275611534_Conducting_Interaction_Patterns_of_Behavior_in_Focused_Encounters","238758266_Conducting_Interaction_Patterns_of_Behavior_in_Focused_Encounters","221473350_Reconfiguring_spatial_formation_arrangement_by_robot_body_orientation"]}
