{"id":"284870153_Augmented_Reality_Teaching_and_Learning","abstract":"This literature review focuses on augmented realities (AR) for learning that utilize mobile, context-aware technologies (e.g., smartphones, tablets), which enable participants to interact with digital information embedded within the physical environment. We summarize research findings about AR in formal and informal learning environments (i.e., schools, universities, museums, parks, zoos, etc.), with an emphasis on the affordances and limitations associated with AR as it relates to teaching, learning, and instructional design. As a cognitive tool and pedagogical approach, AR is primarily aligned with situated and constructivist learning theory, as it positions the learner within a real-world physical and social context while guiding, scaffolding and facilitating participatory and metacognitive learning processes such as authentic inquiry, active observation, peer coaching, reciprocal teaching and legitimate peripheral participation with multiple modes of representation.","authors":["Matt Dunleavy","Chris Dede"],"meta":["January 2014","DOI:10.1007/978-1-4614-3185-5_59"],"references":["320336320_ARIS_An_open_source_platform_for_developing_mobile_learning_experiences","283816284_Next_Generation_Assessments_for_Measuring_Complex_Learning_in_Science","258028835_Design-Based_Research_An_Emerging_Paradigm_for_Educational_Inquiry","244954585_A_Constructivist_Alternative_to_the_Representational_View_of_Mind_in_Mathematics_Education","237541987_Neomillennial_Learning_Styles_Propagated_by_Wireless_Handheld_Devices","228889868_Learning_through_Situated_Simulations_Exploring_Mobile_Augmented_Reality","226389826_On_Location_Learning_Authentic_Applied_Science_with_Networked_Augmented_Realities","225344439_Rapid_Prototyping_an_Alternative_Instructional_Design_Strategy","221519396_Like_Bees_Around_the_Hive_A_Comparative_Study_of_a_Mobile_Augmented_Reality_Map","220934269_AR_gone_wild_two_approaches_to_using_augmented_reality_learning_games_in_Zoos","200772846_Cognitive_Flexibility_Constructivism_and_Hypertext_Random_Access_Instruction_for_Advanced_Knowledge_Acquisition_in_Ill-Structured_Domains","5285760_Social_constructivist_perspectives_on_teaching_and_learning","4334394_Experiences_with_Handheld_Augmented_Reality","3970885_Environmental_Detectives_PDAs_as_a_window_into_a_virtual_simulated_world","3208983_Recent_advances_in_augmented_reality_IEEE_Comput_Graphics_Appl","2402396_Transfer_Of_Learning","318866111_Fundamentals_of_Surgical_Simulation_Principles_and_Practice","288467056_Social_Learning_Theory","279397289_Research_Note","271429289_Design_Research_Theoretical_and_Methodological_Issues","265092108_The_2011_Horizon_Report","262273082_EcoMOBILE_Integrating_augmented_reality_and_probeware_with_environmental_education_field_trips","261297350_Resuscitating_research_in_educational_technology_Using_game-based_learning_research_as_a_lens_for_looking_at_design-based_research","247503720_Flight_Simulator_Training_Effectiveness_A_Meta-Analysis","247502345_ThinkerTools_Causal_Models_Conceptual_Change_and_Science_Education","246676294_Situated_Learning_Legitimate_Peripheral_Practice","238375028_Why_design-based_research_is_both_important_and_difficult","232599292_Science_of_education_and_the_psychology_of_the_child_Trans_D_Coltman","231513994_Toward_A_Theory_of_Instruction","229068230_Mind_in_society_The_development_of_higher_mental_processes","228389979_Efficiency_and_innovation_in_transfer","226563169_Beyond_Educational_Psychology_Steps_Toward_an_Educational_Semiotic","226135430_Theoretical_Perspectives_Influencing_the_Use_of_Information_Technology_in_Teaching_and_Learning","220473931_Lessons_Learned_about_Designing_Augmented_Realities","220042164_If_Design-Based_Research_is_the_Answer_What_is_the_Question_A_Commentary_on_Collins_Joseph_and_Bielaczyc_diSessa_and_Cobb_and_Fishman_Marx_Blumenthal_Krajcik_and_Soloway_in_the_JLS_Special_Issue_on_De","220040297_Psychology_of_Learning_for_Instruction","215439195_Achieving_Coordination_in_Collaborative_Problem-Solving_Groups","209410256_Transfer_of_learning_Issues_and_research_agenda_No_NSF03-212","201382146_A_Model_for_Understanding_How_Virtual_Reality_Aids_Complex_Conceptual_Learning","49761167_Augmenting_your_own_reality_Student_authoring_of_science-based_augmented_reality_games","49176543_Situated_Cognition_and_Culture_of_Learning","23716382_Immersive_Interfaces_for_Engagement_and_Learning"]}
