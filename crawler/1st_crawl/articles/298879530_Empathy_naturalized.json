{"id":"298879530_Empathy_naturalized","abstract":"Empathy is the ability to share emotions with others. It is acknowledged to be a powerful means of tacit communication, a key ingredient in any therapeutic relationship as well as in psychotherapy. Empathy is the cornerstone in the humanist perspective (Ego-psychology) in clinical psychology. This approach is often considered as poorly grounded on scientific and objective evidence. It is however acknowledged that empathetic therapists are more effective than less empathetic therapists. I shall argue that this paradox, i.e. it is the least scientific and the less validated psychotherapeutic approach that is the most efficient, can be eliminated if one considers the nature of empathy, its biological foundation, its evolutionary origin and its cognitive architecture. In this paper I will suggest that empathy is based on specific information processing modules which have been designed by natural selection to cope with social regularities in expressing and reading emotional states. This has provided adaptive benefits to individuals living in large groups bestowing them with mechanisms for cooperativity, altruism and more generally various aspects of prosocial behaviour. The capacity to express emotions, and to read and understand emotions of others also ensures implicit communication with others and may be at the root of intersubjectivity. This perspective on empathy is then articulated with two concurrent hypotheses regarding theory of mind (the simulation and the theory-theory) which aim to explain the human capacity to understand that the behaviors of other intelligent agents are caused by intentions, desires and beliefs. In this context, empathy can be considered as a simulation (or analogical) process that is necessary to understand but not sufficient to interpret other people. This last issue is relevant to clinical practice.","authors":["Jean Decety"],"meta":["January 2002L Enc√©phale 28(1):9-20"],"references":["262830694_Top-Down_Effect_of_Strategy_on_the_Perception_of_Human_Biological_Motion_A_PET_Investigation","232596492_Pretense_and_representation_The_origins_of_theory_of_mind","229811659_Another_look_at_imitation_in_autism","51363005_Gallagher_HL_Happe_F_Brunswick_N_Fletcher_PC_Frith_U_Frith_CD_Reading_the_mind_in_cartoons_and_stories_an_fMRI_study_of_'theory_of_mind'_in_verbal_and_nonverbal_tasks_Neuropsychologia_38_11-21","15629049_An_Internal_Model_for_Sensorimotor_Integration","13865233_Brain_Activity_During_Observation_of_Actions_Influence_of_Action_Content_and_Subject's_Strategy","273037939_A_PET_study_of_voluntary_movement_in_schizophrenic_patients_experiencing_passivity_phenomena_delusions_of_alien_control","264483351_Folk_Psychology_as_Simulation","247780198_Facial_Expressions_of_Emotion_New_Findings_New_Questions","232026096_On_sharing_experiences","222518517_A_PET_Investigation_of_the_Attribution_of_Intentions_with_a_Nonverbal_Task","221803444_Brain_mechanisms_of_social_cognition","22256642_Imitation_of_Facial_and_Hand_Gestures_by_Human_Neonates","20866751_Individuals_with_sociopathic_behavior_caused_by_frontal_damage_fail_to_respond_autonomically_to_social_stimuli","20054766_LFA-I_and_other_accessory_molecules_functioning_in_adhesions_of_T_and_B_lymphocytes","19455020_Human_Autonomy_and_the_frontal_lobes_Part_I_Imitation_and_Utilization_Behavior_a_neuropsychological_study_of_75_patients","16167458_A_cortical_network_for_directed_attention_and_unilateral_neglect","13452241_Self-perception_and_action_in_infancy","12977906_Pain-related_neurons_in_the_human_cingulate_cortex_2","12977142_Neural_Mechanisms_Subserving_the_Perception_of_Human_Actions","12737932_Social_cognition_and_the_brain","12631340_New_aspects_of_motion_perception_Selective_neural_encoding_of_apparent_human_movements","12102452_Unconscious_Facial_Reactions_to_Emotional_Facial_Expressions","8855144_Neural_basis_of_the_spontaneous_optokinetic_response_produced_by_visual_inversion"]}
