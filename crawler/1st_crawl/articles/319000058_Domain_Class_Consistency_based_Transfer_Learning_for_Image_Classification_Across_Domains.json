{"id":"319000058_Domain_Class_Consistency_based_Transfer_Learning_for_Image_Classification_Across_Domains","abstract":"Distribution mismatch between the modeling data and the query data is a known domain adaptation issue in machine learning. To this end, in this paper, we propose a l2,1-norm based discriminative robust kernel transfer learning (DKTL) method for high-level recognition tasks. The key idea is to realize robust domain transfer by simultaneously integrating domain-class-consistency (DCC) metric based discriminative subspace learning, kernel learning in reproduced kernel Hilbert space, and representation learning between source and target domain. The DCC metric includes two properties: domain-consistency used to measure the between-domain distribution discrepancy and class-consistency used to measure the within-domain class separability. The essential objective of the proposed transfer learning method is to maximize the DCC metric, which is equivalently to minimize the domain-class-inconsistency (DCIC), such that domain distribution mismatch and class inseparability are well formulated and unified simultaneously. The merits of the proposed method include (1) the robust sparse coding selects a few valuable source data with noises (outliers) removed during knowledge transfer, and (2) the proposed DCC metric can pursue more discriminative subspaces of different domains. As a result, the maximum class-separability is also well guaranteed. Extensive experiments on a number of visual datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over other state-of-the-art domain adaptation and transfer learning methods.","authors":["Lei Zhang","Jian Yang","David Zhang"],"meta":["August 2017Information Sciences 418","DOI:10.1016/j.ins.2017.08.034"],"references":["268820453_Domain_Adaptation_Extreme_Learning_Machines_for_Drift_Compensation_in_E-Nose_Systems","262808250_Asymmetric_and_Category_Invariant_Feature_Transformations_for_Domain_Adaptation","261317681_Robust_visual_domain_adaptation_with_low-rank_reconstruction","258218677_Unsupervised_Visual_Domain_Adaptation_Using_Subspace_Alignment","253335726_Joint_Embedding_Learning_and_Sparse_Regression_A_Framework_for_Unsupervised_Feature_Selection","220320403_Large_scale_transductive_SVMs","2985446_Gradient-Based_Learning_Applied_to_Document_Recognition","314219003_Odor_Recognition_in_Multiple_E-Nose_Systems_With_Cross-Domain_Discriminative_Subspace_Learning","310752944_Frustratingly_easy_domain_adaptation","306046846_Robust_Visual_Knowledge_Transfer_via_Extreme_Learning_Machine_Based_Domain_Adaptation","301317057_Deep_Learning_of_Transferable_Representation_for_Scalable_Domain_Adaptation","298902744_Boosted_Cross-Domain_Dictionary_Learning_for_Visual_Categorization","290443699_LSDT_Latent_Sparse_Domain_Transfer_Learning_for_Visual_Adaptation","287799208_Discriminative_Transfer_Subspace_Learning_via_Low-Rank_and_Sparse_Representation","286734357_Transfer_Joint_Matching_for_Unsupervised_Domain_Adaptation","263862999_Transfer_Learning_for_Visual_Categorization_A_Survey","262808249_Weakly-Supervised_Cross-Domain_Dictionary_Learning_for_Visual_Recognition","262808247_Generalized_Transfer_Subspace_Learning_Through_Low-Rank_Constraint","262386507_Adaptation_Regularization_A_General_Framework_for_Transfer_Learning","262219249_Transfer_Feature_Learning_with_Joint_Distribution_Adaptation","261479425_Generalized_Domain-Adaptive_Dictionaries","261200444_Geodesic_flow_kernel_for_unsupervised_domain_adaptation","224579212_Sparse_subspace_clustering","224240925_Domain_Transfer_Multiple_Kernel_Learning","223969598_Robust_Recovery_of_Subspace_Structures_by_Low-Rank_Representation","221344982_Robust_Subspace_Segmentation_by_Low-Rank_Representation","220279627_Domain_Adaptation_From_Multiple_Sources_A_Domain-Dependent_Regularization_Approach","51925348_Visual_Event_Recognition_in_Videos_by_Learning_from_Web_Data","45861561_Frustratingly_Easy_Domain_Adaptation","44618705_Multi-PIE"]}
