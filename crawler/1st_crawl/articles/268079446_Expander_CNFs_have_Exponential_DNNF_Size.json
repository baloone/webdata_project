As corollaries we obtain that, in general, negating a DNNF\nleads to an exponential increase in size (this was known to hold if P is not\nequal to NP), and that the language of prime implicates (PI) can be\nexponentially more succinct than DNNFs (this was not even known conditionally).\nThese results settle three open problems in the area of knowledge compilation\n[Adnan Darwiche and Pierre Marquis, A Knowledge Compilation Map, 2002].","authors":["Simone Bova","Florent Capelli","Stefan Mengel","Friedrich Slivovsky"],"meta":["November 2014","SourcearXiv"],"references":["220432305_Knowledge_Compilation_and_Theory_Approximation","2807704_The_Comparative_Linguistics_of_Knowledge_Representation","2540262_A_Knowledge_Compilation_Map","289023323_CV-width_A_new_complexity_parameter_for_CNFs","268525641_On_Compiling_Structured_CNFs_to_OBDDs","267812027_On_the_Read-Once_Property_of_Branching_Programs_and_CNFs_of_Bounded_Treewidth","263693826_A_very_simple_function_that_requires_exponential_size_read-once_branching_programs","238711592_On_the_number_of_prime_implicants","222653600_A_very_simple_function_that_requires_exponential_size_nondeterministic_graph-driven_read-once_branching_programs","221603282_A_Lower_Bound_on_the_Size_of_Decomposable_Negation_Normal_Form","220695960_The_Probabilistic_Method","220695947_Branching_Programs_and_Binary_Decision_Diagrams"]}
