{"id":"3316773_A_Human_Identification_Technique_Using_Images_of_the_Iris_and_Wavelet_Transform","abstract":"A new approach for recognizing the iris of the human eye is\npresented. Zero-crossings of the wavelet transform at various resolution\nlevels are calculated over concentric circles on the iris, and the\nresulting one-dimensional (1-D) signals are compared with model features\nusing different dissimilarity functions","authors":["Wageeh W Boles","Boualem Boashash"],"meta":["May 1998IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing 46(4):1185 - 1188","DOI:10.1109/78.668573","SourceIEEE Xplore"],"references":["17083076_Theory_of_Edge_Detection","3077853_Zero_Crossings_of_a_Wavelet_Transform","252955114_Recognizing_human_eyes","220182132_Daygman_JG_High_Confidence_Visual_Recognition_of_persons_by_a_test_of_Statistical_Independence_IEEE_Transaction","3561327_System_for_automated_iris_recognition","3192721_Recognition_of_2D_object_contours_using_the_wavelet_transform_zero-crossing_representation","3192194_High_confidence_visual_recognition_of_persons_by_a_test_of_statistical_independence"]}
