{"id":"333804328_K-Medoids_Clustering_Is_Solvable_in_Polynomial_Time_for_a_2d_Pareto_Front","abstract":"The k-medoids problem is a discrete sum-of-square clustering problem, which is known to be more robust to outliers than k-means clustering. As an optimization problem, k-medoids is NP-hard. This paper examines k-medoids clustering in the case of a two-dimensional Pareto front, as generated by bi-objective optimization approaches. A characterization of optimal clusters is provided in this case. This allows to solve k-medoids to optimality in polynomial time using a dynamic programming algorithm. More precisely, having N points to cluster, the complexity of the algorithm is proven in \\(O(N^3)\\) time and \\(O(N^2)\\) memory space. This algorithm can also be used to minimize conjointly the number of clusters and the dissimilarity of clusters. This bi-objective extension is also solvable to optimality in \\(O(N^3)\\) time and \\(O(N^2)\\) memory space, which is useful to choose the appropriate number of clusters for the real-life applications. Parallelization issues are also discussed, to speed-up the algorithm in practice.","authors":["Nicolas Dupin","Frank Nielsen","El-Ghazali Talbi"],"meta":["January 2020","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-21803-4_79","In book: Optimization of Complex Systems: Theory, Models, Algorithms and Applications (pp.790-799)","Project: Clustering algorithms in a 2d Pareto Front"],"references":["327797677_Introduction_to_HPC_with_MPI_for_Data_Science","326552317_Dynamic_Programming_heuristic_for_k-means_Clustering_among_a_2-dimensional_Pareto_Frontier","321482087_MBSE_PLM_MIP_and_Robust_Optimization_for_System_of_Systems_Management_Application_to_SCCOA_French_Air_Defense_Program","316882972_Modelisation_et_resolution_de_tres_grands_problemes_stochastiques_combinatoires_application_a_la_gestion_de_production_electrique","259231686_Ckmeans1ddp_Optimal_k-means_Clustering_in_One_Dimension_by_Dynamic_Programming","227414937_A_Clustering_Procedure_for_Reducing_the_Number_of_Representative_Solutions_in_the_Pareto_Front_of_Multiobjective_Optimization_Problems","220343586_NP-hardness_of_Euclidean_sum-of-squares_clustering","220115721_Output-Sensitive_Peeling_of_Convex_and_Maximal_Layers","339285995_Clustering_a_2d_Pareto_Front_P-center_Problems_Are_Solvable_in_Polynomial_Time","312908300_Fast_Exact_k-Means_k-Medians_and_Bregman_Divergence_Clustering_in_1D","311532032_MBSE_PLM_MIP_and_Robust_Optimization_for_System_of_Systems_Management_Application_to_SCCOA_French_Air_Defense_Program","307954225_Undergraduate_Topics_in_Computer_Science","289479823_The_gap_test_an_optimal_method_for_determining_the_number_of_natural_classes_in_cluster_analysis","279729680_Hypervolume_Subset_Selection_in_Two_Dimensions_Formulations_and_Algorithms","266656111_Two-dimensional_subset_selection_for_hypervolume_and_epsilon-indicator","232346486_Easy_and_Hard_Bottleneck_Location_Problems","227003420_Multiobjective_Combinatorial_Optimization_-_Theory_Methodology_and_Applications","225328077_A_genetic_k-medoids_clustering_algorithm","222695091_Data_Clustering_50_Years_Beyond_K-Means","220682848_Least_Squares_Quantization_in_PCM's","216457232_Investigating_and_Exploiting_the_Bias_of_the_Weighted_Hypervolume_to_Articulate_User_Preferences","200622136_Metaheuristics_From_Design_to_Implementation","51887646_Load-Balancing_Spatially_Located_Computations_using_RectangularPartitions"]}
