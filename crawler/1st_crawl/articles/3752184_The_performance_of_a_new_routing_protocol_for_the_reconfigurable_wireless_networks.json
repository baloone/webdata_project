{"id":"3752184_The_performance_of_a_new_routing_protocol_for_the_reconfigurable_wireless_networks","abstract":"In this paper, we investigate the performance of a novel routing\nprotocol, the zone routing protocol (ZRP), that was introduced in Haas\n(1997). The protocol is targeted at a special class of ad-hoc networks,\nwhich we refer to as the reconfigurable wireless networks (RWNs). RWNs\nare distinguished from other ad-hoc networks by their increased node\nmobility, larger number of nodes, and wider network span. We demonstrate\nthat ZRP significantly reduces the delay and the amount of routing\noverhead by providing each node with continuous updates of its local\nneighborhood (routing zone) topology only. The structure of the routing\nzone is exploited to efficiently acquire routes on demand for\ndestinations that lie beyond a node's routing zone. By adjusting a\nsingle parameter-the size of the routing zone-the ZRP can adapt to a\nvariety of network operational conditions","authors":["Haas J.
