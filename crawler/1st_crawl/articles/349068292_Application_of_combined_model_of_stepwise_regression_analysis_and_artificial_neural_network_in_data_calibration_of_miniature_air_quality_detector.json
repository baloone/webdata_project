We use correlation analysis to find out the main factors affecting air quality, and then build a stepwise regression model for six types of pollutants based on 8 months of data. Taking the stepwise regression fitting value and the data monitored by the miniature air quality detector as input variables, combined with the multilayer perceptron neural network, the SRA-MLP model was obtained to correct the pollutant data. We compared the stepwise regression model, the standard multilayer perceptron neural network and the SRA-MLP model by three indicators. Whether it is root mean square error, average absolute error or average relative error, SRA-MLP model is the best model. Using the SRA-MLP model to correct the data can increase the accuracy of the self-built point data by 42.5% to 86.5%. The SRA-MLP model has excellent prediction effects on both the training set and the test set, indicating that it has good generalization ability. This model plays a positive role in scientific arrangement and promotion of miniature air quality detectors. It can be applied not only to air quality monitoring, but also to the monitoring of other environmental indicators.","authors":["Bing Liu","Qingbo Zhao","Yueqiang Jin","Jiayu Shen"],"meta":["February 2021Scientific Reports 11(1):3247","DOI:10.1038/s41598-021-82871-4"],"references":["348396263_Analysis_and_prediction_of_air_quality_in_Nanjing_from_autumn_2018_to_summer_2019_using_PCR-SVR-ARMA_combined_model","341489739_Short-Term_Air_Quality_Prediction_Based_on_Fractional_Grey_Linear_Regression_and_Support_Vector_Machine","334725402_Macao_air_quality_forecast_using_statistical_methods","332510360_An_Empirical_Comparison_of_Multiple_Linear_Regression_and_Artificial_Neural_Network_for_Concrete_Dam_Deformation_Modelling","322507638_A_machine_learning_calibration_model_using_random_forests_to_improve_sensor_performance_for_lower-cost_air_quality_monitoring","305151777_Field_calibration_of_a_cluster_of_low-cost_commercially_available_sensors_for_air_quality_monitoring_Part_B_NO_CO_and_CO2","334610635_Macao_air_quality_forecast_using_statistical_methods","333401907_Correlation_and_principal_component_regression_analysis_for_studying_air_quality_and_meteorological_elements_in_Wuhan_China","324448709_Using_statistical_methods_to_carry_out_in_field_calibrations_of_low_cost_air_quality_sensors","324138745_The_use_of_random_forests_in_modelling_short-term_air_pollution_effects_based_on_traffic_and_meteorological_conditions_A_case_study_in_Wroclaw"]}
