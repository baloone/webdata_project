{"id":"327906722_An_extended_family_of_nonconforming_quasi-Wilson_elements_for_solving_elasticity_problem","abstract":"This contribution (part two) focuses on numerical implementation and efficiency aspects of an extended family of nonconforming quasi-Wilson elements type. Such a class of nonconforming elements has been introduced recently in Achchab et al. (2015). Here, based on a rectangular mesh, it is used for the approximate solution of a planar elasticity problem. It is shown that this family passes the patch-test, and that by suitably adding some orthogonality conditions, on a general class of enrichment functions, we can derive higher order consistency error estimates. Our general theoretical results, see Theorems 4.1 and 4.2, unify, simplify and extend a number of existing works on the improvement of the order of consistency error. Numerical experiments are carried out to demonstrate that our method is optimal for various Lamé parameter μ shear modulus λ and locking free when the Poisson parameter ν approaches close to 0.5.","authors":["Achchab Boujemâa","Abdellatif Agouzal","Guessab Allal","Yassine Zaim"],"meta":["September 2018Applied Mathematics and Computation 344","DOI:10.1016/j.amc.2018.09.059"],"references":["285090538_Experience_with_the_patch_test_for_convergence_of_finite_elements_The_mathematical_foundations_of_the_finite_element_method_with_applications_to_partial_differential_equations","282609691_A_new_class_of_nonconforming_finite_elements_for_the_enrichment_of_Q1_element_on_convex_polytope","278049874_Nonconforming_finite_element_analysis_for_Poisson_eigenvalue_problem","267668976_The_finite_element_method_for_elliptic_problems_Metod_konechnykh_ehlementov_dlya_ehllipticheskikh_zadach_Transl_from_the_English_by_B_I_Kvasov","266299629_High_accuracy_analysis_of_the_Wilson_element","265457298_Variational_crimes_in_the_finite_element_method","256937190_Nonconforming_quadrilateral_finite_element_method_for_a_class_of_nonlinear_sine-Gordon_equations","256379082_On_the_convergence_of_Wilson's_nonconforming_element_for_solving_the_elastic_problems","252035567_Special_convergence_analysis_of_Quasi-Wilson_element","242981700_Lower_spectral_bounds_by_Wilson's_brick_discretization","235409926_The_Mathematical_Theory_of_Finite_Element_Method","229494057_The_Patch_Test_A_condition_for_assessing_FEM_convergence","226226198_Superconvergence_analysisand_error_expansion_forthe_Wilson_nonconforming_finite_element","223319460_New_expansions_of_numerical_eigenvalues_by_Wilson's_element","220317095_A_discrete_Korn's_inequality_in_two_and_three_dimensions"]}
