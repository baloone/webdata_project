{"id":"262351644_Small_Stretch_Pairwise_Spanners","abstract":"Let G = (V,E) be an undirected unweighted graph on n vertices. A subgraph H of G is called an (α,β) spanner of G if for each (u,v) ∈ V ×V, the u-v distance in H is at most α·δ\nG\n(u,v) + β. The following is a natural relaxation of the above problem: we care for only certain distances, these are captured by the set \\(\\mathcal{P} \\subseteq V \\times V\\) and the problem is to construct a sparse subgraph H, called an (α,β) \\(\\mathcal{P}\\)-spanner, where for every \\((u,v) \\in \\mathcal{P}\\), the u-v distance in H is at most α·δ\nG\n(u,v) + β.\nWe show how to construct a (1,2) \\(\\mathcal{P}\\)-spanner of size \\(\\tilde{O}(n\\cdot|\\mathcal{P}|^{1/3})\\) and a (1,2) (S×V)-spanner of size \\(\\tilde{O}(n\\cdot(n|S|)^{1/4})\\). A D-spanner is a \\(\\mathcal{P}\\)-spanner when \\(\\mathcal{P}\\) is described implicitly via a distance threshold D as \\(\\mathcal{P} = \\{(u,v): \\delta(u,v) \\ge D\\}\\). For a given D ∈ ℤ + , we show how to construct a (1,4) D-spanner of size \\(\\tilde{O}(n^{3/2}/{D^{1/4}})\\) and for D ≥ 2, a (1,4logD) D-spanner of size \\(\\tilde{O}(n^{3/2}/{\\sqrt{D}})\\).","authors":["Telikepalli Kavitha","Nithin M.
