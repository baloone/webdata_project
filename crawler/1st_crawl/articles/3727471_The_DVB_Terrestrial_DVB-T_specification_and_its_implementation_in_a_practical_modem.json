{"id":"3727471_The_DVB_Terrestrial_DVB-T_specification_and_its_implementation_in_a_practical_modem","abstract":"Key features of the DVB-T specification for digital terrestrial\ntelevision, jointly agreed in 1996 by broadcasters and manufacturers,\nare described. The DVB-T builds on the work of several European\ncollaborative projects and uses COFDM to counter the peculiarities of\nthe terrestrial channel. Some issues affecting the receiver cost and\nfeasibility are explained, including details of the effects of\nlocal-oscillator phase noise. An experimental modem, built by BBC\nR&D and used to make the first-ever successful demonstration of\nDVB-T-compliant transmissions, is outlined","authors":["J.H.
