{"id":"322240298_Encouraging_technology-based_ventures_Entrepreneurship_education_and_engineering_graduates","abstract":"This article examines entrepreneurship courses offered by engineering faculties in Canada. The venturing rate of engineering students, whether the venturing rate increases if students have taken a course in entrepreneurship, and the type of ventures created are also explored. A recent census and an empirical study of two groups of engineering graduates from a Canadian university were utilized. Findings have implications for educators and administrators and for policy-makers interested in encouraging economic growth.","authors":["Teresa V. Menzies","Joseph C.
