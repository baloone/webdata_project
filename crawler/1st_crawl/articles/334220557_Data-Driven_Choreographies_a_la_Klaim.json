{"id":"334220557_Data-Driven_Choreographies_a_la_Klaim","abstract":"We propose Klaim as a suitable base for a novel choreographic framework. More precisely we advocate Klaim as a suitable language onto which to project data-driven global specifications based on distributed tuple spaces. These specifications, akin to behavioural types, describe the coordination from a global point of view. Differently from behavioural types though, our specifications express the data flow across distributed tuple spaces rather than detailing the communication pattern of processes. We devise a typing system to validate Klaim programs against projections of our global specifications. An interesting feature of our typing approach is that well-typed systems have an arbitrary number of participants. In standard approaches based on behavioural types, this is often achieved at the cost of considerable technical complications.","authors":["Roberto Bruni","Andrea Corradini","Fabio Gadducci","Hern√°n Melgratti"],"meta":["July 2019","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-21485-2_11","In book: Models, Languages, and Tools for Concurrent and Distributed Programming (pp.170-190)"],"references":["330150153_Distributed_programming_using_role-parametric_session_types_in_go_statically-typed_endpoint_APIs_for_dynamically-instantiated_communication_structures","227281389_The_Klaim_Project_Theory_and_Practice","225835882_Sessions_and_Session_Types_An_Overview","221668600_On_Global_Types_and_Multi-Party_Session","221602730_Language_Primitives_and_Type_Discipline_for_Structured_Communication-Based_Programming","220700411_A_Theory_of_Design-by-Contract_for_Distributed_Multiparty_Interactions","3187929_KLAIM_A_kernel_language_for_agents_interaction_and_mobility","321238688_Semantics_of_global_view_of_choreographies","306043582_An_Abstract_Semantics_of_the_Global_View_of_Choreographies","303789186_Multiparty_asynchronous_session_types","301239740_Foundations_of_Session_Types_and_Behavioural_Contracts","267145805_Resolving_Non-determinism_in_Choreographies","238073281_Examples_for_Multiparty_Asynchronous_Session_Types","230775307_Parameterised_Multiparty_Session_Types","221442653_Partial_Order_Models_of_Concurrency_and_the_Computation_of_Functions","220404862_Generative_communication_in_LINDA"]}
