{"id":"228527520_Improving_QA_Using_Arabic_Wordnet","abstract":"With the expansion of the content available on the web, Question/Answering (Q/A) systems have become, among other searching tools, a focus of researchers and users as well. For the Arabic language very few works have been done in this field. In this paper, we focus on the improvement of Q/A through a Query Expansion (QE) process. Our approach is based on the ontology that we have built using Arabic WordNet. Indeed, we designed a QE process from the semantic relations existing among the concepts of our ontology. The preliminary experiments that we have conducted show that the accuracy of getting the answer expected was improved by our QE approach.","authors":["Lahsen Abouenour","Karim Mohamed Bouzoubaa","Paolo Rosso"],"meta":["December 2008","Conference: Arabic Conference on Information Technology (ACIT)At: Tunisia"],"references":["255612700_Arabic_WordNet_and_the_Challenges_of_Arabic","242284689_Implementation_of_the_ArabiQA_Question_Answering_System's_Components","228943745_Towards_an_Arabic_Question_Answering_system","228935859_QARAB_a_question_answering_system_to_support_the_Arabic_language","228848243_Ontologies_in_Amine_Platform_Structures_and_Processes","228667466_Arabic_named_entity_recognition_using_conditional_random_fields","228600187_Vision_statement_to_guide_research_in_Question_Answering_QA_and_Text_Summarization","221649191_Development_of_Intelligent_Systems_and_Multi-Agents_Systems_with_Amine_Platform","221628946_Adapting_the_JIRS_Passage_Retrieval_System_to_the_Arabic_Language","230854795_WordNet_-_An_Electronical_Lexical_Database"]}
