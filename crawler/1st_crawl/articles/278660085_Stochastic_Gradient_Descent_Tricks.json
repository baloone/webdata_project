{"id":"278660085_Stochastic_Gradient_Descent_Tricks","abstract":"Chapter 1 strongly advocates the stochastic back-propagation method to train neural networks. This is in fact an instance of a more general technique called stochastic gradient descent (SGD). This chapter provides background material, explains why SGD is a good learning algorithm when the training set is large, and provides useful recommendations.","authors":["LÃ©on Bottou"],"meta":["January 2012","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-35289-8_25","In book: Neural Networks: Tricks of the Trade (pp.421-436)"],"references":["265347329_Some_applications_of_concentration_inequalities_to_statistics","246031929_Efficient_Estimations_from_a_Slowly_Convergent_Robbins-Monro_Process","239060748_Concentration_inequalities_and_empirical_processes_theory_applied_to_the_analysis_of_learning_algorithms","236736831_Acceleration_of_Stochastic_Approximation_by_Averaging","221653970_Training_linear_SVMs_in_linear_time","221345645_Trust_region_Newton_method_for_large-scale_logistic_regression","220320442_RCV1_A_New_Benchmark_Collection_for_Text_Categorization_Research","220320158_SGD-QN_Careful_Quasi-Newton_Stochastic_Gradient_Descent","2666659_A_Statistical_Study_on_On-line_Learning","313161692_Adaptive_Switching_Circuits","313060232_Learning_Internal_Representations_by_Error_Propagation","312973075_The_tradeoffs_of_large_scale_learning","312538118_Support-vector_networks","304824205_Regression_Shrinkage_and_Selection_via_the_LASSO","283993435_Learning_internal_representations_by_error_propagation","239557089_The_perceptron_-_a_perceiving_and_recognizing_automaton","236736845_Online_Algorithms_and_Stochastic_Approximations","233784971_On_the_Uniform_Convergence_of_Relative_Frequencies_of_Events_to_Their_Probabilities","230876435_Learning_Internal_Representation_by_Error_Propagation","228057950_Conditional_Random_Fields_Probabilistic_Models_for_Segmenting_and_Labeling_Sequence_Data","224839970_Some_Methods_for_Classification_and_Analysis_of_MultiVariate_Observations","221997039_Regression_shrinkage_and_selection_via_the_LASSO","221346105_SVM_optimization_Inverse_dependence_on_training_set_size","221344925_Pegasos_Primal_estimated_sub-GrAdient_sOlver_for_SVM","220589628_Pegasos_Primal_estimated_sub-gradient_solver_for_SVM","220343922_Support_Vector_Network","220049032_Some_Methods_for_Classification_and_Analysis_of_MultiVariate_Observations","51992084_Numerical_Methods_for_Unconstrained_Optimization_and_Nonlinear_Equations","51964870_Towards_Optimal_One_Pass_Large_Scale_Learning_with_Averaged_StochasticGradient_Descent","38349018_Optimal_aggregation_of_classifiers_in_statistical_learning","3079570_The_importance_of_convexity_in_learning_with_squared_loss","2885544_Online_Convex_Programming_and_Generalized_Infinitesimal_Gradient_Ascent","2529190_Conditional_Random_Fields_Probabilistic_Models_for_Segmenting_and_Labeling_Sequence_Data","1955094_Introduction_to_the_CoNLL-2000_Shared_Task_Chunking"]}
