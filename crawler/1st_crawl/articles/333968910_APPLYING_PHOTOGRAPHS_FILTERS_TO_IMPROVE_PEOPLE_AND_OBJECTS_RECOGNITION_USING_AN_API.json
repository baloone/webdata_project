{"id":"333968910_APPLYING_PHOTOGRAPHS_FILTERS_TO_IMPROVE_PEOPLE_AND_OBJECTS_RECOGNITION_USING_AN_API","abstract":"In a world where computer science started evolving so much that artificial intelligence is recognizing objects and people's reactions from a photo, relying on the technology makes surviving in a modern world so much easier. The most important step in automatic content recognition is the quality of the image-quality which can be improved in many ways. Having a high contrast level provided in a photograph is a characteristic that ensures that more objects would be recognized because Microsoft's Computer Vision API identifies content in the provided photographs using the shapes of the targets. It is clear that making an image's objects more \"visible\" by applying various effects to it will increase the algorithm's recognition.","authors":["Oana CÄƒplescu","Costin-Anton Boiangiu"],"meta":["December 2018"],"references":["326016983_VOTING-BASED_OCR_SYSTEM","277140773_VOTING_BASED_IMAGE_BINARIZATION","263541883_Voting-Based_Layout_Analysis","260076060_Voting-Based_Image_Segmentation"]}
