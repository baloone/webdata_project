{"id":"339762981_Strategies_for_Improving_Academic_Performance_of_Information_Technology_Department_Students'_in_Computer_Programming_Skills_The_Case_of_Wachemo_University","abstract":"Computer programming skill is an essential skill for information technology and for some other natural science department students. However, teaching and learning computer programming ideas and skills has been recognized as a great challenge to both teachers and students. Therefore, the development of efficient learning strategies and environments for computer programming courses have become an important concept. This study is intended to recommend strategies for improving academic performance which can be used in teaching computer programming course effectively to undergraduate students in information technology related departments or informatics departments (including information Technology, computer science, and software engineering and information systems This concluded that there is a need for strategies for improving academic performance which requires planning and implementation to strengthen the motivation of the students to study, boost their academic performance, and uplift the quality of education in information technology departments. Finally, relevant and important workable recommendations have been suggested by the researcher.","authors":["Wubetu Barud Demilie"],"meta":["February 2020International Journal of Scientific Research in Computer Science Engineering and Information Technology","DOI:10.32628/CSEIT206137"],"references":["336493298_Causes_of_Failure_of_University_Students_in_Computer_Programming_Courses_The_Case_of_Wachemo_University","322168736_Improving_Performance_and_Progression_of_Novice_Programmers_Factors_Considerations","263470574_Competing_Dichotomies_in_Teaching_Computer_Programming_to_Beginner-Students","260549178_Performance_of_Students_in_Computer_Programming_Background_Field_of_Study_and_Learning_Approach_Paradigm","240948260_Befriending_Computer_Programming_A_Proposed_Approach_to_Teaching_Introductory_Programming","228356652_PPIG_2004_Factors_Affecting_Course_Outcomes_in_Introductory_Programming","353290592_Strategies_for_Improving_Computer_Science_Students'_Academic_Performance_in_Programming_Skill","320663544_Befriending_Computer_Programming_A_Proposed_Approach_to_Teaching_Introductory_Programming","267705862_An_Overview_of_Computer_Programming_Teaching_Methods","237598134_Improving_teaching_in_Computer_Programming_by_adopting_student-centred_learning_strategies"]}
