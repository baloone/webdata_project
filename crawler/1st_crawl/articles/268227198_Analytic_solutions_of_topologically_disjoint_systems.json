{"id":"268227198_Analytic_solutions_of_topologically_disjoint_systems","abstract":"We describe a procedure to solve an up to $2N$ problem where the particles\nare separated topologically in $N$ groups with at most two particles in each.\nArbitrary interactions are allowed between the (two) particles within one\ngroup. All other interactions are approximated by harmonic oscillator\npotentials. The problem is first reduced to an analytically solvable $N$-body\nproblem and $N$ independent two-body problems. We calculate analytically\nspectra, wave functions, and normal modes for both the inverse square and\ndelta-function two-body interactions. In particular, we calculate separation\nenergies between two strings of particles. We find that the string separation\nenergy increases with $N$ and interaction strength.","authors":["Jeremy Robert Armstrong","Artem G. Volosniev","D. V. Fedorov","A. S.
