{"id":"261960361_Using_CS2013_for_a_department's_curriculum_review_a_case_study","abstract":"Every 10-12 years, the professional computing societies, ACM and IEEE-CS, publish new curricular recommendations for undergraduate programs. On December 20, 2013, an ACM/IEEE-CS Task Force published its new recommendation. Each published recommendation challenges schools to respond. Three core questions involve, \"To what extent do these recommendations fit with the mission and goals of a local institution?\", \"How can a school organize the extensive content into courses?\", and \"Is it feasible for a school to offer a major that meets all of the recommendations?\" This paper describes how the Grinnell College Computer Science faculty utilized the CS 2013 recommendations, as they emerged, to review and update its program. Both the process and the resulting curriculum directly address the three core questions and may provide insights for faculty at other schools as they review their own programs.","authors":["Henry M.
