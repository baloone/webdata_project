{"id":"244118264_Model_Simplification_Procedure_for_Signal_Transduction_Pathway_Models_An_Application_to_IL-6_Signaling","abstract":"Mathematical models of signal transduction pathways are characterized by a large number of proteins and uncertain parameters. One challenge involving these models is parameter identifiability as only a limited amount of quantitative data is generally available. One potential solution to this problem is model simplification, as the parts of the model that cannot be identified in experiments can be reduced. It is the main goal of the presented work to derive a model simplification procedure for signal transduction pathways such that: (1) the model size is significantly reduced such that the model can be validated using available experimental data, and (2) the physical interpretation of the remaining states and parameters is retained.","authors":["Zuyi (Jacky) Huang","Yunfei Chu","Juergen Hahn"],"meta":["March 2010Chemical Engineering Science 65(6):1964-1975","DOI:10.1016/j.ces.2009.11.035","Project: Signal Transduction Pathway Modeling"],"references":["244117584_Parameter_Reduction_for_Stable_Dynamical_Systems_based_on_Hankel_Singular_Values_and_Sensitivity_Analysis","306107438_Multivariable_Feedback_Control","277511890_Insulin_resistance-inducing_cytokines_differentially_regulate_SOCS_mRNA_expression_via_growth_factor-_and_JakStat-signaling_pathways_in_3T3-L1_adipocytes","275422889_General_Sensitivity_Theory","271885515_Modeling_Cell_Signaling_Networks","256392972_Global_Sensitivity_Analysis-A_Computational_Implementation_of_the_Fourier_Amplitude_Sensitivity_Test_FAST","242385246_Introduction_to_System_Sensitivity_Theory","234882741_Study_of_the_Sensitivity_of_Coupled_Reaction_Systems_to_Uncertainties_in_Rate_Coefficients_I_Theory","231375009_Sensor_Network_Design_via_Observability_Analysis_and_Principal_Component_Analysis","231373445_Sensor_Location_for_Stable_Nonlinear_Dynamic_Systems_Multiple_Sensor_Case"]}
