{"id":"254896016_Beyond_the_competitive_aspect_of_the_IOI_it_is_all_about_caring_for_talent","abstract":"The IOI is not just an informatics competition, but a means to care for talent in infor-matics. Caring for talent involves a broad range of issues, including identification of talent and education adjusted to that talent. There is (almost?) no generally accessible literature focusing on informatics talent. To show what such literature could offer, we review several books that address talent in mathematics. These books also contain much that is directly applicable to talent in infor-matics.","authors":["Tom Verhoeff"],"meta":["January 2011"],"references":["354489353_Developing_Math_Talent_A_Comprehensive_Guide_to_Math_Education_for_Gifted_Students_in_Elementary_and_Middle_School","339543441_First_Steps_for_Math_Olympians","267161442_A_primer_for_mathematics_competitions","266859245_A_first_step_to_mathematical_olympiad_problems","265449798_The_Math_Gene_How_Mathematical_Thinking_Evolved_and_Why_Numbers_Are_Like_Gossip","238792425_How_the_Brain_Learns_Mathematics"]}
