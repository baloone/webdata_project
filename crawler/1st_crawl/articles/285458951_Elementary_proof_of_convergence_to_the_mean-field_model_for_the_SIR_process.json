{"id":"285458951_Elementary_proof_of_convergence_to_the_mean-field_model_for_the_SIR_process","abstract":"The susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model has been used extensively to\nmodel disease spread and other processes. Despite the widespread usage of this\nordinary differential equation (ODE) based model which represents the\nmean-field approximation of the underlying stochastic SIR process on contact\nnetworks, only few rigorous approaches exist and these use complex semigroup\nand martingale techniques to prove that the expected fraction of the\nsusceptible and infected nodes of the stochastic SIR process on a complete\ngraph converges as the number of nodes increases to the solution of the\nmean-field ODE model. Extending the elementary proof of convergence for the SIS\nprocess introduced by Armbruster and Beck (2015) to the SIR process, we show\nconvergence in mean-square using only a system of three ODEs, simple\nprobabilistic inequalities, and basic ODE theory. Our approach can also be\ngeneralized to many other types of compartmental models (e.g.,\nsusceptible-infected-recovered-susceptible (SIRS)) which are linear ODEs with\nthe addition of quadratic terms for the number of new infections similar to the\nSI term in the SIR model.","authors":["Ekkehard Beck","Benjamin Armbruster"],"meta":["August 2017Journal of Mathematical Biology 75(2)","DOI:10.1007/s00285-016-1086-1","SourcearXiv"],"references":["324428942_Ordinary_Differential_Equations","324394685_Introduction_to_Probability_Models","305978913_Solutions_of_ordinary_differential_equations_as_limits_of_pure_jump_markov_processes","303720949_Limit_Theorems_for_Sequences_of_Jump_Markov_Processes_Approximating_Ordinary_Differential_Processes","274225549_Studies_in_Ordinary_Differential_Equations","270906092_An_elementary_proof_of_convergence_to_the_mean-field_equations_for_an_epidemic_model","265572804_From_exact_stochastic_to_mean-field_ODE_models_A_new_approach_to_prove_convergence_results","258890870_Ordinary_and_Delay_Differential_Equations","257002976_Continuous_approximation_of_collective_system_behaviour_A_tutorial","237076919_A_Contribution_to_the_Mathematical_Theory_of_Epidemics"]}
