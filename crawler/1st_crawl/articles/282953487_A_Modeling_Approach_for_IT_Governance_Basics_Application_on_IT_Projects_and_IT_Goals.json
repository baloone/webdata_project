{"id":"282953487_A_Modeling_Approach_for_IT_Governance_Basics_Application_on_IT_Projects_and_IT_Goals","abstract":"IT governance meets the need of decision making and leads to settling the main preoccupations company leaders have. It aims at developing good practice through the transmission of reliable, structured and intelligible information on the state of the IT (Information Technology) and the development of the effective steering devices. IT Governance is built around notions such as IT project, IT goal and based upon structured frameworks that can be found in the literature. Despite their existence, these notions are seldom developed and there is no common model posing and describing them as classical governance notions. We therefore put forward IT governance modeling as a means to sort out this lack of consideration, laying out a representation template of IT governance concepts build on probabilities and the Monte Carlo simulation. Our approach stands out by setting up a simple way to deal with these concepts based on the analysis of the literature in order to support the various IT governance syntaxes. This approach thus allows opening new IT Governance knowledge modeling and structuring consistent with IT governance activities.","authors":["Rabii El ghorfi","Mohamed Ouadou","Driss Aboutajdine","Mohamed El Aroussi"],"meta":["November 2014","DOI:10.1109/AIMS.2014.29","Conference: Proceedings - 2nd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Modelling, and Simulation, AIMS 2014"],"references":["236973378_IT_Governance_How_Top_Performers_Manage_IT_Decision_Rights_for_Superior_Results","220693124_Enterprise_Governance_and_Enterprise_Engineering","220591784_Effect_of_Information_Systems_Resources_and_Capabilities_on_Firm_Performance_A_Resource-Based_Perspective","274119117_Knowledge_Management","267922952_Systemes_d'Information_et_Management_des_Organisations","256484046_Modelling_information_flow_for_organisations_A_review_of_approaches_and_future_challenges","247738787_Investigating_the_Strategic_Utilization_of_IT_Resources_in_the_Small_and_Medium-Sized_Firms_of_the_Eastern_Free_State_Province","237246857_Les_ressorts_de_la_securite_informatique_Des_hommes_des_machines_et_des_donnees","234808952_Authentication_access_control_and_audit","234760697_Strategic_Alignment_Leveraging_Information_Technology_for_Transforming_Organizations","221525377_Introduction_to_Monte_Carlo_simulation","44823664_Probabilites_Analyse_Des_Donnees_et_Statistique"]}
