In the component system we first locate facial components, extract them, and combine them into a single feature vector which is classified by a support vector machine (SVM). The two global systems recognize faces by classifying a single feature vector consisting of the gray values of the whole face image. In the first global system we trained a single SVM classifier for each person in the database. The second system consists of sets of view-specific SVM classifiers and involves clustering during training. We performed extensive tests on a database which included faces rotated up to about 40Â° in depth. The component system clearly outperformed both global systems.","authors":["Bernd Heisele","Purdy Ho","Jane Wu","Tomaso A.
