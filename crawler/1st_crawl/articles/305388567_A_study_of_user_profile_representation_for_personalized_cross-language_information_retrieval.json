{"id":"305388567_A_study_of_user_profile_representation_for_personalized_cross-language_information_retrieval","abstract":"Purpose\n– With an increase in the amount of multilingual content on the World Wide Web, users are often striving to access information provided in a language of which they are non-native speakers. The purpose of this paper is to present a comprehensive study of user profile representation techniques and investigate their use in personalized cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) systems through the means of personalized query expansion.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\n– The user profiles consist of weighted terms computed by using frequency-based methods such as tf-idf and BM25, as well as various latent semantic models trained on monolingual documents and cross-lingual comparable documents. This paper also proposes an automatic evaluation method for comparing various user profile generation techniques and query expansion methods.\n\nFindings\n– Experimental results suggest that latent semantic-weighted user profile representation techniques are superior to frequency-based methods, and are particularly suitable for users with a sufficient amount of historical data. The study also confirmed that user profiles represented by latent semantic models trained on a cross-lingual level gained better performance than the models trained on a monolingual level.\n\nOriginality/value\n– Previous studies on personalized information retrieval systems have primarily investigated user profiles and personalization strategies on a monolingual level. The effect of utilizing such monolingual profiles for personalized CLIR remains unclear. The current study fills the gap by a comprehensive study of user profile representation for personalized CLIR and a novel personalized CLIR evaluation methodology to ensure repeatable and controlled experiments can be conducted.","authors":["Dong Zhou","Séamus Lawless","Xuan Wu","Wenyu Zhao"],"meta":["July 2016Aslib Journal of Information Management 68(4):448-477","DOI:10.1108/AJIM-06-2015-0091"],"references":["268378469_Query_Expansion_from_Wikipedia_and_Topic_Web_Crawler_on_CLIR","232607806_Multilingual_User_Modeling_for_Personalized_Re-ranking_of_Multilingual_Web_Search_Results","228881740_Towards_Multilingual_User_Models_for_Personalized_Multilingual_Information_Retrieval","228578916_Query_expansion_via_link_analysis_of_wikipedia_for_clir","221614483_Extending_query_translation_to_cross-language_query_expansion_with_markov_chain_models","221614085_V_A_late_fusion_approach_to_cross-lingual_document_re-ranking","221344838_Topic-link_LDA_Joint_models_of_topic_and_author_community","221301268_Selecting_good_expansion_terms_for_pseudo-relevance_feedback","221301147_Building_simulated_queries_for_known-item_topics_An_analysis_using_six_European_languages","221300993_Improving_Web_search_ranking_by_incorporating_user_behavior_information","221300161_Exploring_folksonomy_for_personalized_search","221299394_Personalizing_search_via_automated_analysis_of_interests_and_activities","220814474_Explicit_Versus_Latent_Concept_Models_for_Cross-Language_Information_Retrieval","220566113_A_Survey_of_Automatic_Query_Expansion_in_Information_Retrieval","220515687_Concept-Based_Information_Retrieval_Using_Explicit_Semantic_Analysis","220116251_Anatomy_and_Empirical_Evaluation_of_an_Adaptive_Web-Based_Information_Filtering_System","200121029_User_Models_for_Adaptive_Hypermedia_and_Adaptive_Educational_Systems","29815923_Probabilistic_Models_of_Information_Retrieval_based_on_Measuring_the_Divergence_from_Randomness","2778283_Automatic_Cross-Language_Information_Retrieval_Using_Latent_Semantic_Indexing","300572406_Towards_Personalized_Multilingual_Information_Access_-_Exploring_the_Browsing_and_Search_Behavior_of_Multilingual_Users","280297870_BiTAM","276974051_Cross-Language_Information_Retrieval","269368475_An_automatic_methodology_to_evaluate_personalized_information_retrieval_systems","266658468_Personalized_document_re-ranking_based_on_Bayesian_probabilistic_matrix_factorization","264526014_Iterative_Refinement_Methods_for_Enhanced_Information_Retrieval","262425317_Translation_Techniques_in_Cross-Language_Information_Retrieval","262217918_Enhancing_personalized_search_by_mining_and_modeling_task_behavior","262157385_Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation","257671597_Personalised_Information_Retrieval_Survey_and_classification","257574319_Cross-language_information_retrieval_models_based_on_latent_topic_models_trained_with_document-aligned_comparable_corpora","257574101_Improving_search_via_personalized_query_expansion_using_social_media","248517624_Using_Monolingual_Clickthrough_Data_to_Build_Cross-lingual_Search_Systems","228645570_Cross-lingual_information_retrieval_with_explicit_semantic_analysis","225250992_Users'_Image_Seeking_Behavior_in_a_Multilingual_Tag_Environment","222506105_User_choices_A_new_yardstick_for_the_evaluation_of_ranking_algorithms_for_interactive_query_expansion","221654332_Collaborative_topic_modeling_for_recommending_scientific_articles","221520088_Cross_lingual_text_classification_by_mining_multilingual_topics_from_Wikipedia","221405139_Multilingual_Topic_Models_for_Unaligned_Text","221301232_LDA-based_document_models_for_Ad-hoc_retrieval","221299972_Personalized_query_expansion_for_the_web","221299634_Re-examining_the_Potential_Effectiveness_of_Interactive_Query_Expansion","221299272_To_personalize_or_not_to_personalize_modeling_queries_with_variation_in_user_intent","221013318_Polylingual_Topic_Models","220515689_Cumulated_Gain-Based_Evaluation_of_IR_Techniques","220319974_Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation","220229047_Examining_the_effectiveness_of_real-time_Query_Expansion","32964478_Implicit_User_Modeling_for_Personalized_Search","2782682_A_Comparative_Study_of_Query_and_Document_Translation_for_Cross-Language_Information_Retrieval","2525458_Comparing_Cross-Language_Query_Expansion_Techniques_by_Degrading_Translation_Resources","2405090_Improving_Query_Translation_for_Cross-Language_Information_Retrieval_using_Statistical_Models","2360407_Improving_Cross_Language_Retrieval_with_Triangulated_Translation"]}
