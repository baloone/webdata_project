{"id":"273640181_Dominance_and_Deficiency_for_Petri_Nets_and_Chemical_Reaction_Networks","abstract":"Inspired by Anderson et al. [J. R. Soc. Interface, 2014] we study the\nlong-term behavior of discrete chemical reaction networks (CRNs). In\nparticular, using techniques from both Petri net theory and CRN theory, we\nprovide a powerful and computationally-efficient sufficient condition for a\nstructurally-bounded CRN to have the property that none of the non-terminal\nreactions can be applied for all its recurrent configurations. We compare this\nresult and its proof with a related result of Anderson et al. and show its\nconsequences for the case of CRNs with deficiency one.","authors":["Robert Brijder"],"meta":["June 2017Natural Computing 16(2)","DOI:10.1007/s11047-017-9612-7","SourcearXiv"],"references":["281756044_Programmability_of_Chemical_Reaction_Networks","260169604_Stochastic_analysis_of_biochemical_reaction_networks_with_absolute_concentration_robustness","236977199_Dynamical_Properties_of_Discrete_Reaction_Networks","228866021_On_closed_support_T_-Invariants_and_the_traffic_equations","300645108_Dominance_and_T-Invariants_for_Petri_Nets_and_Chemical_Reaction_Networks","279285414_Probability_1_Computation_with_Chemical_Reaction_Networks","245040601_Prolegomena_to_the_Rational_Analysis_of_Systems_of_Chemical_Reactions","226273554_Chemical_Mechanism_Structure_and_the_Coincidence_of_the_Stoichiometric_and_Kinetic_Subspaces","225905282_Complex_balancing_in_general_kinetic_systems","225886766_Necessary_and_Sufficient_Conditions_for_Complex_Balancing_in_Chemical_Kinetics","224285547_Deterministic_Function_Computation_with_Chemical_Reaction_Networks","45852335_Deficiency_Zero_Petri_Nets_and_Product_Form","29471068_Natural_Computing_Series","221621579_Linear_Algebra_in_Net_Theory","41910323_Structural_Sources_of_Robustness_in_Biochemical_Reaction_Networks"]}
