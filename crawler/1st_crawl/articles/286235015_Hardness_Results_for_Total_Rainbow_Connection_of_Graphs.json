{"id":"286235015_Hardness_Results_for_Total_Rainbow_Connection_of_Graphs","abstract":"A total-colored path is total rainbow if both its edges and internal vertices have distinct colors. The total rainbow connection number of a connected graph G, denoted by trc(G), is the smallest number of colors that are needed in a total-coloring of G in order to make G total rainbow connected, that is, any two vertices of G are connected by a total rainbow path. In this paper, we study the computational complexity of total rainbow connection of graphs. We show that deciding whether a given total-coloring of a graph (7 makes it total rainbow connected is NP-Complete. We also prove that given a graph G, deciding whether tre(G) = 3 is NP-Complete.","authors":["Lily Chen","Bofeng Huo","Yingbin Ma"],"meta":["January 2015Discussiones Mathematicae Graph Theory 36(2)","DOI:10.7151/dmgt.1856"],"references":["268518108_On_forbidden_subgraphs_and_rainbow_connection_in_graphs_with_minimum_degree_2","253241282_On_the_Rainbow_Vertex-Connection","253241277_Rainbow_Connections_of_Graphs_A_Survey","228829690_Hardness_and_Algorithms_for_Rainbow_Connection","281287398_Rainbow_Connections_of_Graphs","273140981_Note_on_the_complexity_of_deciding_the_rainbow_vertex-connectedness_for_bipartite_graphs","268496917_Rainbow_connection_in_graphs","265964221_Rainbow_connections_for_outerplanar_graphs_with_diameter_2_and_3","262922866_Total_rainbow_-connection_in_graphs","254193865_Rainbow_Connection_in_3-Connected_Graphs"]}
