{"id":"334212087_Stability_analysis_for_safety_of_automotive_multi-product_lines_a_search-based_approach","abstract":"Safety assurance for automotive products is crucial and challenging. It becomes even more difficult when the variability in automotive products is considered. Recently, the notion of automotive multi-product lines (multi-PL) is proposed as a unified framework to accommodate different sources of variability in automotive products. In the context of automotive multi-PL, we propose a stability analysis for safety, motivated by our industrial collaboration, where we observed that under certain operation scenarios, safety varies drastically with small fluctuations in production parameters, environmental conditions, or driving inputs. To characterize instability, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem, and solve it with a search-based approach. The proposed technique is applied to an industrial automotive multi-PL, and experimental results show its effectiveness to spot instability. Moreover, based on information gathered during the search, we provide some insights on both testing and quality engineering of automotive products.","authors":["Nian-Ze Lee","Paolo Arcaini","Shuai Wang","Fuyuki Ishikawa"],"meta":["July 2019","DOI:10.1145/3321707.3321755","Conference: the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference"],"references":["326446840_Testing_Autonomous_Cars_for_Feature_Interaction_Failures_using_Many-Objective_Search","309198035_Input-output_conformance_testing_for_software_product_lines","233341757_Family-Based_Deductive_Verification_of_Software_Product_Lines","224260052_A_practical_guide_for_using_statistical_tests_to_assess_randomized_algorithms_in_software_engineering","221469951_On_Parameter_Tuning_in_Search_Based_Software_Engineering","220958413_Robust_Satisfaction_of_Temporal_Logic_over_Real-Valued_Signals","220740225_Search_Based_Data_Sensitivity_Analysis_Applied_to_Requirement_Engineering","331214422_Towards_a_Framework_for_the_Analysis_of_Multi-Product_Lines_in_the_Automotive_Domain","325730546_Testing_vision-based_control_systems_using_learnable_evolutionary_algorithms","322880696_Feature_Interaction_in_Software_Product_Line_Engineering_A_Systematic_Mapping_Study","318299195_A_comparative_study_of_constrained_multi-objective_evolutionary_algorithms_on_constrained_multi-objective_optimization_problems","311212341_Simulation-Based_Approaches_for_Verification_of_Embedded_Control_Systems_An_Overview_of_Traditional_and_Advanced_Modeling_Testing_and_Verification_Techniques","310824288_Testing_advanced_driver_assistance_systems_using_multi-objective_search_and_neural_networks","303099276_A_practical_guide_to_select_quality_indicators_for_assessing_pareto-based_search_algorithms_in_search-based_software_engineering","280301441_Redesigning_the_jMetal_Multi-Objective_Optimization_Framework","279355975_Experimentation_in_Software_Engineering","262395024_Search-Based_Software_Engineering_Trends_Techniques_and_Applications","257391088_A_systematic_review_and_an_expert_survey_on_capabilities_supporting_multi_product_lines","221617636_Verification_of_Software_Product_Lines_with_Delta-Oriented_Slicing","220695668_Software_Product_Lines_in_Action_The_Best_Industrial_Practice_in_Product_Line_Engineering","220291960_JMetal_A_Java_framework_for_multi-objective_optimization","200827826_Experimentation_In_Software_Engineering_An_Introduction","3418687_A_fast_and_elitist_multiobjective_genetic_algorithm_NSGA-II"]}
