{"id":"316913462_Strategy_for_Algorithm_Design_in_Factoring_RSA_Numbers","abstract":"The article first makes an analysis on characteristic of the RSA numbers based on the factorized RSA numbers and Digital Signature Standard; then it investigates the affection of the divisor-ratio of a RSA number to the efficiency of searching the numberâ€™s divisors in term of valuated binary tree and puts forward a framework for designing algorithms of fast factoring the RSA numbers. Thoughts of the framework are presented with detail mathematical deductions.","authors":["Xingbo Wang"],"meta":["May 2017IOSR Journal of Computer Engineering 19(03):01-07","DOI:10.9790/0661-1903020107","Project: rsa factorization"],"references":["314954446_Genetic_Traits_of_Odd_Numbers_with_Applications_in_Factorization_of_Integers","311801022_Factorization_of_Large_Numbers_via_Factorization_of_Small_Numbers","309426950_Seed_and_Sieve_of_Odd_Composite_Numbers_with_Applications_in_Factorization_of_Integers","302589769_Valuated_Binary_Tree_A_New_Approach_in_Study_of_Integers","295351382_New_Constructive_Approach_to_Solve_Problems_of_Integers'_Divisibility","265231681_An_Overview_of_Cryptography","316459038_A_Parallel_Algorithm_for_Factorization_of_Big_Odd_Numbers","314920831_Prime_Sieve_and_Factorization_Using_Multiplication_Table","314240458_Algorithm_Design_and_Implementation_for_a_Mathematical_Model_of_Factoring_Integers","279334612_Cryptanalytic_attacks_on_RSA"]}
