{"id":"305584916_Using_Genetic_Algorithm_for_Advanced_Municipal_Waste_Collection_in_Smart_City","abstract":"The Internet of Things (IoT), as expected infrastructure for envisioned concept of Smart City, brings new possibilities for the city management. IoT vision introduces promising and economical solutions for massive data collection and its analysis which can be applied in many domains and so make them operating more efficiently. In this paper, we are discussing one of the most challenging issues-municipal waste-collection within the Smart City. To optimize the logistic procedure of waste collection, we use own genetic algorithm implementation. The presented solution provides calculation of more efficient garbage-truck routes. As an output, we provide a set of simulations focused on mentioned area. All our algorithms are implemented within the integrated simulation framework which is developed as an open source solution with respect to future modifications.","authors":["Radek Fujdiak","Pavel Masek","Ekaterina Olshannikova","Petr Mlynek"],"meta":["July 2016","DOI:10.1109/CSNDSP.2016.7574016","Conference: 2016 10th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks and Digital Signal Processing (CSNDSP)At: Prague"],"references":["303145337_Universal_smart_energy_communication_platform","301553144_Verification_of_Genetic_Algorithm_in_Dynamic_Traffic_Light_Management","283270613_Wireless_M-BUS_An_Attractive_M2M_Technology_for_5G-Grade_Home_Automation","283031756_An_Improved_Genetic_Algorithm_with_Initial_Population_Strategy_for_Symmetric_TSP","281723197_A_Smart_Waste_Management_with_Self-Describing_Complex_Objects","266202065_Universal_Smart_Energy_Communication_Platform","263926871_Energy_from_municipal_solid_waste","261137278_On_the_Internet_of_Things_smart_cities_and_the_WHO_Healthy_Cities","228629166_Urban_Solid_Waste_Collection_and_Routing_The_Ant_Colony_Strategic_Approach","223327602_Performance_characteristics_of_the_diffusion_driven_desalination_process","41847011_Genetic_Algorithm_for_the_Traveling_Salesman_Problem_using_Sequential_Constructive_Crossover_Operator","11351955_An_optimisation_model_for_regional_integrated_solid_waste_management_I_Model_formulation","312252932_Wireless_M-BUS_An_Attractive_M2M_Technology_for_5G-Grade_Home_Automation","291319282_Waste_bin_monitoring_system_using_integrated_technologies","279988872_Optimization_of_municipal_solid_waste_collection_and_transportation_routes","277338108_Municipal_solid_waste_collection_optimization_in_Singapore","263700017_Methodology_to_design_a_municipal_solid_waste_generation_and_composition_map_A_case_study","260269037_A_Powerful_Genetic_Algorithm_for_Traveling_Salesman_Problem","256082092_Optimizing_the_treatment_and_disposal_of_municipal_solid_wastes_using_mathematical_programming-A_case_study_in_a_Greek_region","246549128_A_methodology_to_optimally_site_and_design_municipal_solid_waste_transfer_stations_using_binary_programming","242012117_Traveling_Salesman_Problem","221942587_An_interval_nonlinear_program_for_the_planning_of_waste_management_systems_with_economies-of-scale_effects-A_case_study_for_the_region_of_Hamilton_Ontario_Canada","7691217_Optimization_of_municipal_solid_waste_management_in_Port_Said_-_Egypt","6789992_A_decision_support_system_for_the_operational_planning_of_solid_waste_collection","5806229_Multi-objective_optimization_of_solid_waste_flows_Environmentally_sustainable_strategies_for_municipalities","4768265_Optimization_model_for_integrated_municipal_solid_waste_management_in_Mumbai_India"]}
