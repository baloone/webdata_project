Concretely we prove two new fixed point results for monotone and continuous self-mappings in 0-complete partial quasi-metric spaces and, in addition, we show that the assumptions in the statement of such results cannot be weakened. Furthermore, as an application, we present a quantitative fixed point technique which is helpful for asymptotic complexity analysis of algorithms.","authors":["Zahra Mohammadi","O.
