{"id":"345398887_A_Bibliometric_Analysis_in_Industry_40_and_Advanced_Manufacturing_What_about_the_Sustainable_Supply_Chain","abstract":"During the last decade, different concepts, methodologies, and technologies have appeared, evolving industry toward what we know today as the fourth industrial evolution or Industry 4.0 (I4.0) and Advanced Manufacturing (AM). Based on both, Supply Chain (SC) is presented as the relevant process that sets the sustainability of manufacturing and, therefore, is defined as a key term in a sustainable approach to I4.0. However, there are no studies that analyze the evolution of science in the fields of I4.0 and AM together. In order to fill this gap, the aim of this research work is to analyze the tendencies of science research related to I4.0 and AM by conducting a bibliometric and network analysis and also to generate a new contribution through the analysis of scientific trends related to SC and Sustainable Supply Chain (SSC) within this scientific context, for the time span 2010–2019. The results show that the number of publications is growing exponentially and the most active countries are Germany and the U.S., with Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule (RWTH) Aachen University being the most productive organization and Tecnologico de Monterrey the most collaborative. The analysis of the scientific terms allows us to conclude that the research field is in a growth phase, generating up to almost 4500 new terms in 2019.","authors":["Jon Borregan Alvarado","Izaskun Álvarez Meaza","Ernesto Cilleruelo","Gaizka Garechana"],"meta":["September 2020Sustainability 12(19):7840","DOI:10.3390/su12197840"],"references":["336822165_Examining_The_Concept_of_Industry_40_Studies_Using_Text_Mining_and_Scientific_Mapping_Method","336386920_Scopus_scientific_mapping_production_in_industry_40_2011-2018_a_bibliometric_analysis","335351942_The_evolution_of_keywords_co-occurrence_network_based_on_MAG_dataset_1800-2017","333067777_Supply_Chain_Management_and_Logistics_40_-_A_Study_on_Arrowhead_Framework_Integration","330259255_Industry_40_technologies_Implementation_patterns_in_manufacturing_companies","337104010_Industry_40_A_bibliometric_review_of_its_managerial_intellectual_structure_and_potential_evolution_in_the_service_industries","335840072_Industry_40_and_Lean_Manufacturing_A_Systematic_Literature_Review_and_Future_Research_Directions","335483587_Industry_Focused_in_Data_Collection_How_Industry_40_is_Handled_by_Big_Data","334946510_Sustainable_Development_Supported_by_Industry_40_A_Bibliometric_Analysis","334635104_Globalization_of_science_and_international_scientific_collaboration_A_network_perspective"]}
