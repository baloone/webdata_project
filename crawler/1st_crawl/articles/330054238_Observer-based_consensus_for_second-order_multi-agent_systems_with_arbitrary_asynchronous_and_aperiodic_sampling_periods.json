{"id":"330054238_Observer-based_consensus_for_second-order_multi-agent_systems_with_arbitrary_asynchronous_and_aperiodic_sampling_periods","abstract":"A novel distributed consensus protocol, where only sampled position information is exchanged between neighboring agents, is designed for second-order multi-agent systems under a directed communication topology. This protocol allows to reach the consensus for asynchronous and aperiodic sampling periods, which means that every agent can send its measurements independently from its neighbors. Furthermore, the upper bound on the sampling periods can be chosen arbitrarily long by adapting the tuning parameters. This result is obtained by using a continuous–discrete time observer which allows to reconstruct the system state in real time from only discrete-time measurements. The feedback control gain is set according to the observer gain which is itself set according to the maximum sampling period.","authors":["Tomas Ménard","Emmanuel Moulay","Patrick Coirault","Michael Defoort"],"meta":["January 2019Automatica 99:237-245","DOI:10.1016/j.automatica.2018.10.045"],"references":["309819569_A_cascade_observer_for_a_class_of_MIMO_non_uniformly_observable_systems_with_delayed_sampled_outputs","274062551_Observer_design_for_a_class_of_uncertain_nonlinear_systems_with_sampled_outputs_-_Application_to_the_estimation_of_kinetic_rates_in_bioreactors","320393085_A_survey_on_recent_advances_in_distributed_sampled-data_cooperative_control_of_multi-agent_systems","318560563_Fixed-Time_Consensus_Tracking_for_Multi-Agent_Systems_with_High-Order_Integrator_Dynamics","297618222_Distributed_sampled-data_asynchronous_H_filtering_of_Markovian_jump_linear_systems_over_sensor_networks","292215410_Consensus_problems_in_networks_of_agents_with_switching_topology_and_time-delays","284122790_Some_necessary_and_sufficient_conditions_for_consensus_of_second-order_multi-agent_systems_with_sampled_position_data","281542663_Asynchronous_Consensus_of_Multiple_Double-Integrator_Agents_With_Arbitrary_Sampling_Intervals_and_Communication_Delays","264464866_Second-order_consensus_for_directed_multi-Agent_systems_with_sampled_data","263617086_Observer-based_consensus_of_second-order_multi-agent_system_with_fixed_and_stochastically_switching_topology_via_sampled_data"]}
