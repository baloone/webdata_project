{"id":"340740233_Enhancing_the_Cloud_Inter-operation_Toolkit_CIT_to_Support_Multiple_Cloud_Service_Models","abstract":"In the field of computer science, cloud computing plays an inevitable role in offering on-demand services to end users. The capability, and hence the advantage, of a cloud environment is widened when multiple clouds interact. However, this interaction is usually done in a static environment and/or with the help of insecure brokers. To the best of our knowledge, the Cloud Inter-operation Toolkit (CIT) is the only work that has broken this barrier to enable a dynamic and broker-less inter-cloud environment. In this work, we aim to improve the security measures in such an environment and to further optimize the resources and time consumed to establish the environment. A novel resource provisioning technique is also proposed for such an environment to ensure that resource accessibility by the users is not interrupted and to effectively utilize the computing resources. Furthermore, taking CIT a step forward, it is enhanced to support multiple cloud service models, thereby making it superior to all other existing inter-cloud facilitating approaches.","authors":["Kirthica S.","I.
