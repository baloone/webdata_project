{"id":"223815776_ROOT_-_An_object_oriented_data_analysis_framework","abstract":"The ROOT system in an Object Oriented framework for large scale data analysis. ROOT written in C++, contains, among others, an efficient hierarchical OO database, a C++ interpreter, advanced statistical analysis (multi-dimensional histogramming, fitting, minimization, cluster finding algorithms) and visualization tools. The user interacts with ROOT via a graphical user interface, the command line or batch scripts. The command and scripting language is C++ (using the interpreter) and large scripts can be compiled and dynamically linked in. The OO database design has been optimized for parallel access (reading as well as writing) by multiple processes.","authors":["Rene Brun","Fons Rademakers"],"meta":["April 1997Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section A Accelerators Spectrometers Detectors and Associated Equipment 389(1-2):81-86","DOI:10.1016/S0168-9002(97)00048-X"],"references":["3498758_The_Fabrik_programming_environment"]}
