{"id":"304404333_Synthesis_Classification_and_Properties_of_Nanomaterials","abstract":"Nanomaterials are materials with at least one external dimension measuring approximately 1 to 100 nm. They play an important role in the fabrication of many devices and modified materials because of their unique physical and chemical properties, such as a large surface-area-to-volume ratio, and their high mechanical strength. This chapter discusses the synthesis, classification, and characterization of nanomaterials. Zero-dimensional, one-dimensional, two-dimensional, and three-dimensional nanostructured materials are discussed. The synthesis of nanomaterials, including top-down and bottom-up approaches, and various chemical, physical, and mechanical methods are addressed. The applications of nanomaterials and nanoparticles incorporated into polymeric nanomaterials in adsorption and membrane processes are also discussed.","authors":["Tawfik Abdo Saleh","Vinod K Gupta"],"meta":["December 2016","DOI:10.1016/B978-0-12-804703-3.00004-8","In book: Nanomaterial and Polymer Membranes (pp.83-133)","Project: nanotechnology for water"],"references":["259151886_Graphene_Oxide_Assisted_Hydrothermal_Carbonization_of_Carbon_Hydrates","236196823_The_Road_for_Nanomaterials_Industry_A_Review_of_Carbon_Nanotube_Production_Post-Treatment_and_Bulk_Applications_for_Composites_and_Energy_Storage","226331865_Production_of_Carbon_Nanotubes","273467515_Preparation_Characterization_and_Antibacterial_Activity_of_Silver_Nanoparticle-Decorated_Graphene_Oxide_Nanocomposite","266476776_Inorganic_Nanomaterials_in_Polymeric_Ultrafiltration_Membranes_for_Water_Treatment","257778481_Synthesis_of_large-area_few-layer_graphene_on_iron_foil_by_chemical_vapor_deposition","236153981_Decoration_of_carbon_nanotubes","231292252_Modeling_Cd_and_Zn_Sorption_to_Hydrous_Metal_Oxides","229930062_Efficient_TiO2_Photocatalysts_from_Surface_Hybridization_of_TiO2_Particles_with_Graphite-like_Carbon","228011823_One-Step_Ionic-Liquid-Assisted_Electrochemical_Synthesis_of_Ionic-Liquid-Functionalized_Graphene_Sheets_Directly_from_Graphite","227982425_Graphene_The_New_Two-Dimensional_Nanomaterial","227816363_Nanocrystalline_Metal_Oxides_as_Unique_Chemical_ReagentsSorbents","227742087_Removal_of_Sulphur_Compounds_from_Naphtha_Solutions_using_Solid_Adsorents","227220603_A_review_of_TiO2_nanoparticles","225188131_Molecular_Electronics_with_Carbon_Nanotubes","224029245_Single_Sheet_Functionalized_Graphene_by_Oxidation_and_Thermal_Expansion_of_Graphite","41579702_Carbon_Nanomaterials_in_Biosensors_Should_You_Use_Nanotubes_or_Graphene","12068800_Dendrimer-Encapsulated_Metal_Nanoparticles_Synthesis_Characterization_and_Applications_to_Catalysis","8636521_Electrochemical_sensing_with_electrodes_modified_with_molecularly_imprinted_polymer_films","8168046_Controlled_Microwave_Heating_in_Modern_Organic_Synthesis","7949217_Dendrimer_Enhanced_Ultrafiltration_1_Recovery_of_CuII_from_Aqueous_Solutions_Using_PAMAM_Dendrimers_with_Ethylene_Diamine_Core_and_Terminal_NH_2_Groups","6933756_Preparation_Characterization_and_Surface_Modification_of_Silver_Nanoparticles_in_Formamide","6635619_Copper_Catalyzing_Growth_of_Single-Walled_Carbon_Nanotubes_on_Substrates","5824074_Fast_Mass_Transport_Through_Carbon_Nanotube_Membranes"]}
