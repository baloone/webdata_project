{"id":"24091331_Does_Compulsory_School_Attendance_Affect_Schooling_and_Earnings","abstract":"We establish that season of birth is related to educational attainment because of school start age policy and compulsory school\nattendance laws. Individuals born in the beginning of the year start school at an older age, and can therefore drop out after\ncompleting less schooling than individuals born near the end of the year. Roughly 25 percent of potential dropouts remain\nin school because of compulsory schooling laws. We estimate the impact of compulsory schooling on earnings by using quarter\nof birth as an instrument for education. The instrumental variables estimate of the return to education is close to the ordinary\nleast squares estimate, suggesting that there is little bias in conventional estimates.","authors":["Joshua D.
