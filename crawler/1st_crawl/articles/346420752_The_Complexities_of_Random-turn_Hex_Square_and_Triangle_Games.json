{"id":"346420752_The_Complexities_of_Random-turn_Hex_Square_and_Triangle_Games","abstract":"In random-turn games, players toss a coin to decide who moves. This paper studies the complexities of the algorithms for playing random-turn connection games perfectly on regular tessellations. Our study theoretically shows that there are algorithms playing random-turn Hex, Square and Triangle perfectly in \n${O(n^{9}\\cdot 2.618^{n}),\\ O(n^{9}\\cdot 2.746^{n})}$ \nand \n${O(n^{9}\\cdot 3.645^{n})}$ \ntime for each move respectively, where n is the board size. We then implement the perfect-playing algorithm for random-turn Square and measure the actual running time it costs for each move. We then compute and analyze the game lengths on random-turn Square, Hex and Triangle and conjecture that the asymptotic complexity of their game lengths are the same. We finally compare the perfect-playing algorithm with the sampling algorithm by competing against each other, and the numbers of their wins and loses are reported.","authors":["Yi Yang","Shuigeng Zhou","Jihong Guan","Chuan-sheng Shen"],"meta":["October 2020IEEE Transactions on Games PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TG.2020.3033720"],"references":["321924751_Move_Prediction_using_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_in_Hex","2121953_Random-Turn_Hex_and_Other_Selection_Games","290578970_On_Board-Filling_Games_with_Random-Turn_Order_and_Monte_Carlo_Perfectness","220437214_Two-Stage_Monte_Carlo_Tree_Search_for_Connect6","220198340_Hex_ist_PSPACE-vollstandig"]}
