{"id":"303921206_Kinetic_Models_of_Catalytic_Reactions","abstract":"The book presents “three kinetics”: (a) detailed, oriented to the elucidation of a detailed reaction mechanism according to its kinetic laws; (b) applied, with the aim of obtaining kinetic relationships for the further design of chemical reactors; and (c) mathematical kinetics whose purpose is the analysis of mathematical models for heterogeneous catalytic reactions taking place under steady- or unsteady state conditions\n\nBesides establishing a general theory permitting us to investigate the dependence of kinetic characteristics for complex reactions on the structure of detailed mechanism, the book provides a comprehensive analysis of some concrete typical mechanisms for catalytic reactions, in particular for the oxidation of carbon monoxide on platinum metals. This reaction is a long-standing traditional object of catalysis study, “Mona Lisa” of heterogeneous catalysis. \n\nTable of Contents\n\n1. Minimum minimorum. 2.
