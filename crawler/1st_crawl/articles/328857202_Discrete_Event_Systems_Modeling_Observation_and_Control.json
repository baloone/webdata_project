{"id":"328857202_Discrete_Event_Systems_Modeling_Observation_and_Control","abstract":"This article begins with an introduction to the modeling of discrete event systems, a class of dynamical systems with discrete states and event-driven dynamics. It then focuses on logical discrete event models, primarily automata, and reviews observation and control problems and their solution methodologies. Specifically, it discusses diagnosability and opacity in the context of partially observed discrete event systems. It then discusses supervisory control for both fully and partially observed systems. The emphasis is on presenting fundamental results first, followed by a discussion of current research directions. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Control, Robotics, and Autonomous Systems Volume 2 is May 3, 2019.
