{"id":"326039530_Digital_Twin_of_a_Cutting_Tool","abstract":"This paper focuses on a digital twin of a cutting tool as a digital replica of a physical tool, its data format and structure, information flows and data management, as well as possibilities for further applications and analysis of productivity. Data are collected throughout the production lifecycle in an accurate way, using the international standard ISO 13399 and messaging based on the previously developed event-driven line information system architecture (LISA) with IoT functionality. The digital twin is tweeted to be stored, refined and propagated to the process planning for an optimized machining solution.","authors":["Darya Botkina","Mikael Hedlind","Bengt Olsson","Jannik Henser"],"meta":["January 2018Procedia CIRP 72:215-218","DOI:10.1016/j.procir.2018.03.178"],"references":["316356881_Shaping_the_digital_twin_for_design_and_production_engineering","315328118_Digital_twin-driven_product_design_manufacturing_and_service_with_big_data","302195867_Cutting_Tool_Data_Representation_and_Implementation_Based_on_STEP_AP242","304904897_An_event-driven_manufacturing_information_system_architecture_for_Industry_40","282465830_About_The_Importance_of_Autonomy_and_Digital_Twins_for_the_Future_of_Manufacturing"]}
