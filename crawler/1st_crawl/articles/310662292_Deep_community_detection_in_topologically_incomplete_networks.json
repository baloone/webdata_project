{"id":"310662292_Deep_community_detection_in_topologically_incomplete_networks","abstract":"In this paper, we consider the problem of detecting communities in topologically incomplete networks (TIN), which are usually observed from real-world networks and where some edges are missing. Existing approaches to community detection always consider the input network as connected. However, more or less, even nearly all, edges are missing in real-world applications, e.g. the protein-protein interaction networks. Clearly, it is a big challenge to effectively detect communities in these observed TIN.","authors":["Xin Xin","Chaokun Wang","Xiang Ying","Boyang Wang"],"meta":["November 2016Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications 469","DOI:10.1016/j.physa.2016.11.029"],"references":["228524411_Top_Leaders_Community_Detection_Approach_in_Information_Networks","51955458_Finding_missing_edges_and_communities_in_incomplete_networks","51073119_Structure_Formation_in_Active_Actin_Networks","12002432_Lethality_and_Centrality_in_Protein_Networks","8036163_Controlling_disease_spread_on_networks_with_incomplete_knowledge","8034841_Accuracy_and_Scaling_Phenomena_in_Internet_Mapping","7837091_Statistical_theory_of_Internet_exploration","5915527_Near_Linear_Time_Algorithm_to_Detect_Community_Structures_in_Large-Scale_Networks","5248536_Defining_and_identifying_communities_in_networks","1880802_Comparing_community_structure_identification","304609804_Influence_maximization_by_probing_partial_communities_in_dynamic_online_social_networks","304533565_Finding_community_structure_in_very_large_networksJ","290670922_Community_detection_in_social_networks_An_in-depth_benchmarking_study_with_a_procedure-oriented_framework","280243465_Multiway_spectral_community_detection_in_networks","267640978_Community_detection_by_fuzzy_clustering","260324871_Revealing_Density-Based_Clustering_Structure_from_the_Core-Connected_Tree_of_a_Network","232625580_Dense_Subgraph_Extraction_with_Application_to_Community_Detection","225288846_Graph_Spectra_and_the_Detectability_of_Community_Structure_in_Networks","222652810_Effects_of_Missing_Data_in_Social_Networks","222411422_The_Structure_and_Function_of_Complex_Networks","220231088_Similarity_measures_in_scientometric_research_The_Jaccard_index_versus_Salton's_cosine_formula","32965145_Spectral_Regression_A_Regression_Framework_for_Efficient_Regularized_Subspace_Learning","26257484_Cytoskeletal_Polymer_Networks_Viscoelastic_Properties_are_Determined_by_the_Microscopic_Interaction_Potential_of_Cross-links","10832973_How_Reliable_are_Experimental_Protein-Protein_Interaction_Data","7659762_Finding_and_Evaluating_Community_Structure_in_Networks","4301631_Spectral_Regression_for_Efficient_Regularized_Subspace_Learning","2605577_Newman_MEJ_The_structure_and_function_of_complex_networks_SIAM_Rev_45_167-256","1748846_Towards_Real-Time_Community_Detection_in_Large_Networks"]}
