{"id":"329285981_Label-less_Learning_for_Traffic_Control_in_an_Edge_Network","abstract":"With the development of intelligent applications (e.g., self-driving, real-time emotion recognition), there are higher requirements for cloud intelligence. However, cloud intelligence depends on the multi-modal data collected by user equipments (UEs). Due to the limited capacity of network bandwidth, offloading all data generated from the UEs to the remote cloud is impractical. Thus, in this article, we consider the challenging issue of achieving a certain level of cloud intelligence while reducing network traffic. In order to solve this problem, we design a traffic control algorithm based on label-less learning on the edge cloud, which is dubbed LLTC. By use of the limited computing and storage resources at the edge cloud, LLTC evaluates the value of data that will be offloaded. Specifically, we first give a statement of the problem and the system architecture. Then we design the LLTC algorithm in detail. Finally, we set up the system testbed. Experimental results show that the proposed LLTC can guarantee the required cloud intelligence while minimizing the amount of data transmission.","authors":["Min Chen","Yixue Hao","Kai Lin","Zhiyong Yuan"],"meta":["November 2018IEEE Network 32(6):8-14","DOI:10.1109/MNET.2018.1800110"],"references":["322730061_Selective_Offloading_in_Mobile_Edge_Computing_for_the_Green_Internet_of_Things","322259568_Exploring_Mobile_Edge_Computing_for_5G-Enabled_Software_Defined_Vehicular_Networks","319869218_Narrow_Band_Internet_of_Things","328508925_Wearable_Affective_Robot","326542657_From_cloud-based_communications_to_cognition-based_communications_A_computing_perspective","326194617_Edge-CoCaCo_Toward_Joint_Optimization_of_Computation_Caching_and_Communication_on_Edge_Cloud","323715778_Task_Offloading_for_Mobile_Edge_Computing_in_Software_Defined_Ultra-Dense_Network","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","319606972_Mobile_Edge_Computing_A_Survey","317245201_Enabling_Localized_Peer-to-Peer_Electricity_Trading_Among_Plug-in_Hybrid_Electric_Vehicles_Using_Consortium_Blockchains","313845123_Mobile_Edge_Computing_A_Survey_on_Architecture_and_Computation_Offloading","311159311_Understanding_Mobile_Traffic_Patterns_of_Large_Scale_Cellular_Towers_in_Urban_Environment","292337782_Detection_of_structural_changes_through_principal_component_analysis_and_multivariate_statistical_inference","220689914_Learning_OpenCV_-_computer_vision_with_the_OpenCV_library_software_that_sees"]}
