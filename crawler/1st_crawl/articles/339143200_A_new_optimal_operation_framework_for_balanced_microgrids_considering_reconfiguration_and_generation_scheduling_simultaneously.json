{"id":"339143200_A_new_optimal_operation_framework_for_balanced_microgrids_considering_reconfiguration_and_generation_scheduling_simultaneously","abstract":"In this article, the optimal distribution feeder reconfiguration (DFR) and optimal generation scheduling (OGS) are simultaneously taken into account to enhance operational flexibility and efficiency in microgrids (MGs). The proposed model considers different features of MGs, including distributed generation (DG) units, plug in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), and demand response (DR) programs. Three DR programs are modeled including, load shifting, load curtailing, and time of use (TOU) programs. Uncertainties of renewable generations and loads are modeled using a computationally competitive approach. Both controlled and uncontrolled charging/discharging patterns of PHEVs are investigated. To enhance tractability, the proposed model is formulated as a mixed‐integer second‐order cone programing (MISOCP) problem to minimize operational cost subject to technical and financial constraints. To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, it is examined on the balanced 33‐bus test systems in different case studies of DFR and OGS. The optimization problem is solved using the GAMS software package. It is found that PHEVs and DR not only enhances MG operation flexibility, but they also reduce the total operation cost and smooth load profile.","authors":["Mostafa Sedighizadeh","Gholamreza
