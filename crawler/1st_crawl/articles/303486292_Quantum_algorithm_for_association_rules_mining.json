{"id":"303486292_Quantum_algorithm_for_association_rules_mining","abstract":"Association rules mining is one of the most important problems in knowledge\ndiscovery and data mining. The goal of it is to acquire consumption habits of\ncustomers by discovering the relationships between items from a transaction\ndatabase that has a large number of transactions and items. The most compute\nintensive process for ARM is to find out the frequent 1-itemsets and\n2-itemsets. In this paper, we propose a quantum algorithm for finding out the\nfrequent 1-itemsets and 2-itemsets. In our algorithm, to mine the frequent\n1-itemsets efficiently, we use the technique of amplitude amplification. To\nmine the frequent 2-itemsets efficiently, we propose a new tomography scheme,\ni.e., pure-state-based quantum state tomography. It is shown that our algorithm\nis potential to achieve exponential speedup in the number of transactions and\npolynomial speedup in the number of items over the classical algorithm.","authors":["Chao-Hua Yu","Fei Gao","Qing-Le Wang","Qiao-Yan Wen"],"meta":["October 2016Physical review A, Atomic, molecular, and optical physics 94(4):042311","DOI:10.1103/PhysRevA.94.042311","Project: Quantum algorithms for machine learning and data mining."],"references":["301856731_Pattern_classification_with_linear_regression_on_a_quantum_computer","283986576_Quantum_algorithms_An_overview","282403470_Quantum_Discriminant_Analysis_for_Dimensionality_Reduction_and_Classification","265554646_An_introduction_to_quantum_machine_learning","265209779_The_quest_for_a_Quantum_Neural_Network","319393723_Fast_algorithms_for_mining_association_rules","307525218_Prediction_by_linear_regression_on_a_quantum_computer","291942453_Simulating_Physics_with_Computers","287250868_Quantum_Privacy-Preserving_Data_Mining","270593778_Hamiltonian_Simulation_with_Nearly_Optimal_Dependence_on_all_Parameters"]}
