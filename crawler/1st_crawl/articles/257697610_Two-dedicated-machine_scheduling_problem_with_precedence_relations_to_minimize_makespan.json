{"id":"257697610_Two-dedicated-machine_scheduling_problem_with_precedence_relations_to_minimize_makespan","abstract":"Two-dedicated-parallel-machine scheduling problem with precedence constraints to minimize makespan is considered. This problem originally appeared as a sub-problem in assembly line balancing but it has also its own applications. Complexity and approximation results for this scheduling problem and its special cases with chains of jobs or equal-processing-times are presented.","authors":["Evgeny Gafarov","Alexandre Dolgui"],"meta":["April 2014Optimization Letters 8(4)","DOI:10.1007/s11590-013-0671-0"],"references":["278628259_Maximization_Problems_in_Single_Machine_Scheduling","265634044_Hard_Special_Case_and_Other_Complexity_Results_for_SALBP-1","263138303_Maximization_Problems_in_Single_Machine_Scheduling_Models_and_Algorithms_for_Planning_and_Scheduling_Problems_Editors_Philippe_Baptiste_Jacques_Carlier_Alix_Munier_Andreas_S_Schulz","257697337_Bees_Algorithm_for_constrained_fuzzy_multi-objective_two-sided_assembly_line_balancing_problem","251319262_On_the_two-stage_Hybrid_flow_shop_with_dedicated_machines","243707816_A_survey_of_exact_algorithms_for_the_simple_assembly_line_balancing","233145597_Two_Parallel_Machines_Scheduling","233028023_Balancing_two-sided_assembly_lines_A_case_study","229124478_Sequencing_and_Scheduling_Algorithms_and_Complexity","227445774_A_Survey_of_Exact_Algorithms_for_the_Simple_Assembly_Line_Balancing_Problem"]}
