{"id":"220115880_On_finding_spanning_trees_with_few_leaves","abstract":"The problem of finding a spanning tree with few leaves is motivated by the design of communication networks, where the cost of the devices depends on their routing functionality (ending, forwarding, or routing a connection). Besides this application, the problem has its own theoretical importance as a generalization of the Hamiltonian path problem. Lu and Ravi showed that there is no constant factor approximation for minimizing the number of leaves of a spanning tree, unless P=NP. Thus instead of minimizing the number of leaves, we are going to deal with maximizing the number of non-leaves: we give a linear-time 2-approximation for arbitrary graphs, a 32-approximation for claw-free graphs, and a 65-approximation for cubic graphs.","authors":["Gábor Salamon","Gábor Wiener"],"meta":["February 2008Information Processing Letters 105(5):164-169","DOI:10.1016/j.ipl.2007.08.030","SourceDBLP"],"references":["228057554_On_Approximating_the_Longest_Path_in_a_Graph","2772679_On_Approximating_the_Longest_Path_in_a_Graph","2668935_2-Approximation_Algorithm_for_Finding_a_Spanning_Tree_with_Maximum_Number_of_Leaves","252368906_Handbook_of_theoretical_computer_science_-_Part_A_Algorithms_and_complexity_Part_B_Formal_models_and_semantics","229131388_Spanning_spiders_and_light-splitting_switches","222503294_Approximating_Maximum_Leaf_Spanning_Trees_in_Almost_Linear_Time","221220086_On_Approximating_the_Longest_Path_in_a_Graph_Preliminary_Version","220976515_Approximation_Algorithms_for_the_Maximum_Internal_Spanning_Tree_Problem","220770214_2-Approximation_Algorithm_for_Finding_a_Spanning_Tree_with_Maximum_Number_of_Leaves","2643910_The_Power_of_Local_Optimization_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Maximum-leaf_Spanning_Tree_DRAFT"]}
