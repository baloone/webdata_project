{"id":"325539270_Data-Driven_Meets_Theory-Driven_Research_in_the_Era_of_Big_Data_Opportunities_and_Challenges_for_Information_Systems_Research","abstract":"The era of big data provides many opportunities for conducting impactful research from both data-driven and theory-driven perspectives. However, data-driven and theory-driven research have progressed somewhat independently. In this paper, we develop a framework that articulates important differences between these two perspectives and proposes a role for information systems research at their intersection. The framework presents a set of pathways that combine the data-driven and theory-driven perspectives. From these pathways, we derive a set of challenges, and show how they can be addressed by research in information systems. By doing so, we identify an important role that information systems research can play in advancing both data-driven and theory-driven research in the era of big data.","authors":["Wolfgang Maass","Jeffrey Parsons","Sandeep Purao","Veda C.
