{"id":"327640561_Evolving_maps_and_decks_for_ticket_to_ride","abstract":"We present a search-based approach to generating boards and decks of cards for the game Ticket to Ride. Our evolutionary algorithm searches for boards that allow for a well-shaped game arc, and for decks that promote an equal distribution of desirability for cities. We show examples of two boards generated by our algorithm and compare our results to those of the actual components of the game. Our approach creates game content that is specifically designed towards metrics that can affect gameplay in an impactful way.","authors":["Fernando De Mesentier Silva","Scott Lee","Julian Togelius","Andy Nealen"],"meta":["August 2018","DOI:10.1145/3235765.3235813","Conference: the 13th International Conference"],"references":["319366874_AI-based_playtesting_of_contemporary_board_games","313951711_Generating_heuristics_for_novice_players","260475413_A_Comparative_Evaluation_of_Procedural_Level_Generators_in_the_Mario_AI_Framework","258243521_Towards_the_Automatic_Generation_of_Card_Games_through_Grammar-Guided_Genetic_Programming","257564581_Controllable_procedural_map_generation_via_multiobjective_evolution","235974383_Evolving_card_sets_towards_balancing_dominion","226194900_Two_Algorithms_for_Constructing_a_Delaunay_Triangulation","309280537_Procedural_Content_Generation_in_Games","277575120_Petalz_Search-Based_Procedural_Content_Generation_for_the_Casual_Gamer","237940080_Galactic_Arms_Race_an_experiment_in_evolving_video_game_content"]}
