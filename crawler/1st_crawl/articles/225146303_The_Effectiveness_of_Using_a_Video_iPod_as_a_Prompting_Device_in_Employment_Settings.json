{"id":"225146303_The_Effectiveness_of_Using_a_Video_iPod_as_a_Prompting_Device_in_Employment_Settings","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of using a video iPod as a prompting device for teaching three\njob-related tasks to a young man with developmental disabilities in a community-based employment setting. The effectiveness\nof the prompting device was evaluated using a multiple probe across behaviors design. Results indicated that the introduction\nof the video iPod was associated with immediate and substantial gains in independent correct responding with an associated\ndecrease in the number of prompts given from a job coach. In addition, the participant used the video iPod independently.\nInstructional implications and future research will be discussed.","authors":["Toni Van Laarhoven","Jesse W.
