First, a modified terminal sliding mode (TSM) surface is approached to avoid the singularity problem of conventional TSM. Then, a nonsingular TSM control is designed for joint position tracking of a robotic manipulator. In the control scheme, fully tuned RBFNNs are adopted to approximate the nonlinear unknown dynamics of the robotic manipulator. Adaptive learning algorithms are derived to allow online adjustment of the output weights, the centers and the variances in the RBFNNs. Meanwhile, a continuous robust control term is added to eliminate chattering efforts in the sliding mode control (SMC) system. The stability and finite-time convergence of the closed-loop system are established by using Lyapunov theory. Finally, the simulation results of a two-link robotic manipulator are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control method.","authors":["Minh Duc Tran","Hee-Jun Kang"],"meta":["July 2016International Journal of Precision Engineering and Manufacturing 17(7):863-870","DOI:10.1007/s12541-016-0105-x"],"references":["224501905_Practical_Nonsingular_Terminal_Sliding-Mode_Control_of_Robot_Manipulators_for_High-Accuracy_Tracking_Control","223344540_Adaptive_multi-model_sliding_mode_control_of_robotic_manipulators_using_soft_computing","223100524_Non-Singular_Adaptive_Terminal_Sliding_Mode_Control_of_Rigid_Manipulators","222597726_Finite_time_stability_and_stabilization_of_a_class_of_continuous_systems","3206155_Survey_of_robust_control_for_rigid_robots","3022107_A_Robust_MIMO_Terminal_Sliding_Mode_Control_Scheme_for_Rigid_Robotic_Manipulators","309629827_Applied_Nonlinear_Control","261527955_A_reaching_law_based_neural_network_terminal_sliding-mode_guidance_law_design","256492542_On_the_Adaptive_Control_of_Robot_Manipulators","255823960_Sliding_Mode_Control_In_Engineering","255823668_Applied_Nonlinear_Control","238181386_Choice_of_discontinuous_control_component_for_robust_sliding_mode_performance","232931536_Terminal_sliding_mode_tracking_control_for_a_class_of_SISO_uncertain_nonlinear_systems","230873496_Sliding_Mode_in_Control_Optimization","229672579_Terminal_sliding_mode_control_of_second-order_nonlinear_uncertain_systems","224369641_Neural-Network-Based_Terminal_Sliding-Mode_Control_of_Robotic_Manipulators_Including_Actuator_Dynamics","224260328_Neural_PD_control_with_second-order_sliding_mode_compensation_for_robot_manipulators","224228142_Variable_Structure_Systems_With_Sliding_Modes_in_Motion_Control-A_Survey","223666635_Adaptive_Motion_Control_of_Rigid_Robots_A_Tutorial","223193624_Continuous_Infinite_time_control_for_robotic_manipulators_with_terminal_sliding_mode","222080209_Terminal_Sliding_Mode_Control_Design_for_Uncertain_Dynamic_Systems","220695644_Introduction_To_Robotics_Mechanics_Control","3623394_A_robust_adaptive_sliding_mode_tracking_control_using_an_RBF_neural_network_for_robotic_manipulators","3336403_Nonsingular_Terminal_Sliding_Mode_Control_of_Robot_Manipulators_Using_Fuzzy_Wavelet_Networks","3323851_Zhihong_M_Fast_terminal_sliding-mode_control_design_for_nonlinear_dynamical_systems_IEEE_Trans_Circuits_Syst_I_Fundam_Theory_Appl_492_261-264","3218310_An_Adaptive_Neurocontroller_Using_RBFN_for_Robot_Manipulators","3217306_Adaptive_neural_network_control_of_robot_manipulators_in_task_space","3216876_Variable_Structure_Control_A_Survey","3021223_On_the_Robust_Control_of_Robot_Manipulators"]}
