{"id":"320734301_Spatio-Temporal_Mobility_Analysis_for_Community_Detection_in_the_Mobile_Networks_Using_CDR_Data","abstract":"Building or detecting community association is a key attribute in understanding relationships in social networks and their behavior. By detecting groups, we can address many issues related to population displacement and intelligent transportation systems. In this paper, we are presenting a method based on\nanalyzing and exploring spatio-temporal mobility patterns from call detail records of mobile users to discover communities. Our proposed approach relies on deriving the eventsâ€™ occurrence in a cells coverage in time and space to match and categorize the users based on their mobility patterns extracted from call detail records\ndata. The final results are the outcome of real experiments that demonstrate interesting and encouraging findings by using mobility patterns as a means to detect communities.","authors":["Artjom Lind","Amnir Hadachi","Peeter Piksarv","Oleg Batrashev"],"meta":["November 2017","DOI:10.1109/ICUMT.2017.8255177","Conference: THE 9TH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON ULTRA MODERN TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL SYSTEMSAt: Munich, Germany","Project: Population Movement Analytics, Monitoring and Prediction Algorithms"],"references":["317905523_A_new_approach_for_mobile_positioning_using_the_CDR_data_of_cellular_networks","315888140_Analysis_of_Associtivity_and_Community_Structure_in_Mobile_Social_Networks","315597095_Analysis_of_the_communities_of_an_urban_mobile_phone_network","310789943_Activity-Based_Human_Mobility_Patterns_Inferred_from_Mobile_Phone_Data_A_Case_Study_of_Singapore","303562336_Community_Detection_in_Social_Networks_Using_User_Frequent_Pattern_Mining","290194734_Mobility_Episode_Detection_from_CDR's_Data_using_Switching_Kalman_Filter","285524903_Core-Based_Dynamic_Community_Detection_in_Mobile_Social_Networks","277594308_Discovering_urban_activity_patterns_in_cell_phone_data","315870338_Trajectory_Recovery_From_Ash_User_Privacy_Is_NOT_Preserved_in_Aggregated_Mobility_Data","299970598_Community_Detection_based_on_Distance_Dynamics"]}
