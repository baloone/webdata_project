For K-5 contexts LOA levels have been named: problem, design, code and\nrunning the code. In a qualitative exploratory study, five K-5 teachers were interviewed on their uses of LOA,\nparticularly the design level, in teaching programming and other subjects. Using PCK elements to analyse\nresponses, the teachers interviewed used design as an instructional strategy and for assessment. The teachers\nused design as an aide memoire and the expert teachers used design: as a contract for pair-programming; to work\nout what they needed to teach; for learners to annotate with code snippets (to transition across LOA); for learners\nto self-assess and to assess ‘do-ability’. The teachers used planning in teaching writing to scaffold learning and\npromote self-regulation revealing their insight in student understanding. One issue was of the teachers'\nknowledge of terms including algorithm and code; a concept of ‘emergent algorithms’ is proposed. Findings\nfrom the study suggest design helps learners learn to program in the same way that planning helps learners learn\nto write and that LOA, particularly the design level, may provide an accessible exemplar of abstraction in action.\nFurther work is needed to verify whether the study's results are generalisable more widely.","authors":["Jane Waite"],"meta":["January 2018","DOI:10.21585/ijcses.v2i1","Project: Abstraction in Action - Primary Programming use of Design"],"references":[]}
