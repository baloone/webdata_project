{"id":"221455189_Modular_interpreted_systems","abstract":"We propose a new class of representations that can be used for modeling (and model checking) temporal, strategic and epistemic properties of agents and their teams. Our representations borrow the main ideas from interpreted systems of Halpern, Fagin et al.; however, they are also modular and compact in the way concurrent programs are. We also mention preliminary results on model checking alternating-time temporal logic for this natural class of models.","authors":["Wojciech Jamroga","Thomas Ã…gotnes"],"meta":["January 2007","DOI:10.1145/1329125.1329286","SourceDBLP","Conference: 6th International Joint Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS 2007), Honolulu, Hawaii, USA, May 14-18, 2007"],"references":["277295903_Modular_interpreted_systems_A_preliminary_report","262250075_Sometimes_and_not_never_revisited_on_branching_versus_linear_time_temporal_logic","234807189_Automatic_Verification_of_Finite_State_Concurrent_Systems_Using_Temporal_Logic_Specifications","227050729_Modelling_knowledge_and_action_in_distributed_systems","303969276_Alternating-Time_Temporal_Logic","249638978_Sometimes_and_not_never_revisited_on_branching_versus_linear_time_preliminary_report","247590951_Sometimes_and_Not_Neve_r_revisited_on_branching_versus_linear_time","239542891_Formal_methods_in_system_design","230625815_Symbolic_Model_Checking_An_Approach_to_the_State_Explosion_Problem","228729601_The_complexity_of_symbolic_model_checking_temporal-epistemic_logics"]}
