{"id":"330971947_Computer-Aided_Musical_Orchestration_Using_an_Artificial_Immune_System","abstract":"The aim of computer-aided musical orchestration is to find a combination of musical instrument sounds that approximates a target sound. The difficulty arises from the complexity of timbre perception and the combinatorial explosion of all possible instrument mixtures. The estimation of perceptual similarities between sounds requires a model capable of capturing the multidimensional perception of timbre, among other perceptual qualities of sounds. In this work, we use an artificial immune system (AIS) called opt-aiNet to search for combinations of musical instrument sounds that minimize the distance to a target sound encoded in a fitness function. Opt-aiNet is capable of finding multiple solutions in parallel while preserving diversity, proposing alternative orchestrations for the same target sound that are different among themselves. We performed a listening test to evaluate the subjective similarity and diversity of the orchestrations.","authors":["Jos√© Abreu","Marcelo Caetano","Rui Penha"],"meta":["March 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-31008-4_1","In book: Evolutionary and Biologically Inspired Music, Sound, Art and Design, 5th International Conference, EvoMUSART 2016, Porto, Portugal, March 30 -- April 1, 2016, Proceedings (pp.1-16)"],"references":["263007963_The_Oxford_handbook_of_music_psychology","242186907_IMITATIVE_AND_GENERATIVE_ORCHESTRATIONS_USING_PRE-ANALYSED_SOUNDS_DATABASES","228633379_Predicting_Timbre_Features_of_Instrument_Sound_Combinations_Application_to_Automatic_Orchestration","224012550_The_perception_of_musical_timbre","220867663_An_Evolutionary_Approach_to_Computer-Aided_Orchestration","220723440_MIR_in_Matlab_II_A_Toolbox_for_Musical_Feature_Extraction_from_Audio","220723431_RWC_Music_Database_Popular_Classical_and_Jazz_Music_Databases","220403649_Solving_the_musical_orchestration_problem_using_multiobjective_constrained_optimization_with_a_genetic_local_search_approach","23558616_A_sawtooth_waveform_inspired_pitch_estimator_for_speech_and_music","14629313_Perceptual_scaling_of_synthesized_musical_timbres_Common_dimensions_specificities_and_latent_subject_classes","3949542_An_artificial_immune_network_for_multimodal_function_optimization","283473630_Automatic_orchestration_for_automatic_composition","267564375_SPORCH_An_Algorithm_for_Orchestration_Based_on_Spectral_Analyses_of_Recorded_Sounds","248931217_Identification_and_blend_of_timbres_as_a_basis_for_orchestration","240415914_Why_is_musical_timbre_so_hard_to_understand","228625043_Simulation_of_human_voice_timbre_by_orchestration_of_acoustic_music_instruments","220386647_Enhancing_Orchestration_Technique_via_Spectrally_Based_Linear_Algebra_Methods","22582703_Multidimensional_perceptual_scaling_of_musical_timbre","7642090_Acoustic_correlates_of_timbre_space_dimensions_A_confirmatory_study_using_synthetic_tones","4295700_An_Instrument_Timbre_Model_For_Computer_Aided_Orchestration"]}
