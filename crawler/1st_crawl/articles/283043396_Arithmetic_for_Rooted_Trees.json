{"id":"283043396_Arithmetic_for_Rooted_Trees","abstract":"We propose a new arithmetic for rooted unordered trees of n vertices and a\nmethod for their enumeration. We define three arithmetic operations on trees\ncalled addition, addition-plus, and multiplication and show how all trees can\nbe generated by addition and addition-plus from a starting tree proving that\nboth operations are needed. We show how a given tree can be obtained as the\nsum, sum-plus, or product of two trees, thus defining prime trees with respect\nto the three operations, and prove that primality can be decided in time\npolynomial in n. We suggest how these concepts can be useful and discuss the\ntwo lines of similar studies appeared in the literature","authors":["Fabrizio Luccio"],"meta":["January 2017Theory of Computing Systems 60(1)","DOI:10.1007/s00224-016-9731-z","SourcearXiv"],"references":["276399026_Upper_Bounds_on_Number_of_Steals_in_Rooted_Trees","256555044_Lexicographic_generation_of_ordered_trees","264957716_Dialgebras_and_Related_Operads","257650162_Computers_and_Intractability","227264286_Graph_multiplication","223388597_A_polynomial_time_algorithm_for_finding_the_prime_factors_of_Cartesian-product_graphs","222647896_Trees_functional_equations_and_combinatorial_Hopf_algebras","222420889_The_Algebra_of_Binary_Search_Trees","220248971_Definition_et_Etude_des_Bilangages_Reguliers","220192181_Weak_reconstruction_of_strong_product_graphs","2206745_The_arithmetic_of_trees","2101235_Combinatorics_of_Rooted_Trees_and_Hopf_Algebras","2822185_On_the_Hopf_algebra_structure_of_perturbative_quantum_field_theories","2100699_Arithmetree"]}
