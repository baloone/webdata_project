{"id":"336604896_CS_scammlbas_ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE_IN_AGRICULTURE_A_REVIEW","abstract":"This paper represents the review of latest technology in computer science era i.e. artificial intelligence and its application in agricultural sector. The challenges faced in this domain are infestation ofpest, irregularities in treatment of soil, improper drainage system and inconsistent irrigation. The following leads to environmental hazards and also there is loss of crop due to more use of chemicals in fields. The researchers have done lot of work and more is yet to be done. The different problems in the field of agriculture can be solved using soft computing techniques, artificial intelligence and various continuous learning algorithms. The agricultural system are being developed for maximum output with the help of latest technologies. The paper covers a review of different research work contributed to overcome the difficulties and challenging problems in the field of agriculture. The paper covers detailed analysis of the work done recently in artificial intelligence of agricultural sector.","authors":["Khushboo Sodi","Sachin S Bhosale","R B Patil"],"meta":["October 2019"],"references":["329843903_Solar_Powered_Smart_Irrigation_System_Using_Internet_of_Things","328890418_Optimal_Control_of_Irrigation_with_Field_Capacity_Modes_Characterizing_the_Minimal_Water_Consumption_Solution","329394111_Crop_Prediction_on_the_Region_Belts_of_India_A_Naive_Bayes_MapReduce_Precision_Agricultural_Model","323263595_Mango_Leaf_Unhealthy_Region_Detection_and_Classification","322880575_IoT_based_smart_soil_monitoring_system_for_agricultural_production","322645919_Soil_irrigation_fuzzy_estimation_approach_based_on_decision_making_in_sugarcane_industry","322589277_Agro-tech_A_digital_model_for_monitoring_soil_and_crops_using_internet_of_things_IOT","321259163_An_algorithm_based_low_cost_automated_system_for_irrigation_with_soil_moisture_sensor","320693975_Computer_aided_system_for_detection_and_classification_of_brinjal_leaf_diseases_using_thermal_and_visible_light_images","316898605_Computer_vision_based_feature_extraction_of_leaves_for_identification_of_medicinal_values_of_plants","291737789_Using_IoT_for_Integrated_Pest_Management","277713549_The_Internet_of_Things_in_Agriculture_for_Sustainable_Rural_Development","312459338_Climate_change_and_its_impact_on_agriculture","308902590_Wireless_Monitoring_of_Soil_Moisture_Temperature_Humidity_Using_Zigbee_in_Agriculture","281475703_Design_of_processing_system_for_agricultural_pests_with_digital_signal_processor"]}
