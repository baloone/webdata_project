{"id":"247220383_Pragmatism_and_self-organization","abstract":"What goes on in the scientific networks and the research teams? What is the collaborative situation like? Why do scientists collaborate? This study focuses on the micro level of research collaboration and investigates the reasons for and effects of collaboration for the individual scientist through a survey and a number of interviews. The interaction within the research team is highlighted, showing the feelings and conditions which encompass the teamwork. The empirical findings are conceptualized in a model where research collaboration is suggested to be understood as dependent on how the reasons, forms and effects respectively vary. The collaborations are characterized by strong pragmatism and a high degree of self-organization. Finally, the science policy implications of this study are discussed. It is suggested that research policy should provide financial and organizational possibilities for the researchers to establish joint ventures and also fund projects on a team or network basis.","authors":["GÃ¶ran Melin"],"meta":["January 2000Research Policy 29(1):31-40","DOI:10.1016/S0048-7333(99)00031-1"],"references":["248204625_Understanding_Patterns_of_International_Scientific_Collaboration","247931310_The_Measurement_of_International_Scientific_Collaboration","17263883_Collaboration_in_an_Invisible_College","4928544_What_is_Research_Collaboration","348100808_The_Sociology_of_Science_in_Europe","316268234_Science_Technology_and_Society","284511742_Prometheus_Bound_Science_in_a_dynamic_steady_state","270008862_Science_Technology_and_Society_New_Directions","249722119_Politeness_and_Certainty_The_Language_of_Collaboration_in_an_AI_Project","249623330_Where_Is_Science_Going","249623139_Child_Care_Research_Collaboration_and_Gender_Differences_in_Scientific_Productivity","242915761_Structure_of_International_Collaboration_in_Science_Typology_of_Countries_Through_Multivariate_Techniques_Using_a_Link_Indicator","242569642_The_Discovery_of_Grounded_Theory_Strategies_for_Qualitative_Research","227098556_A_bibliometric_analysis_of_collaboration_in_a_medical_specialty","226361608_Studying_research_collaboration_using_co-authorships","215915768_The_Discovery_Of_Grounded_Theory_Strategies_For_Qualitative_Research"]}
