{"id":"3913915_Goal-Oriented_Requirements_Engineering_A_Guided_Tour","abstract":"Goals capture, at different levels of abstraction, the various objectives the system under consideration should achieve. Goal-oriented requirements engineering is concerned with the use of goals for eliciting, elaborating, structuring, specifying, analyzing, negotiating, documenting, and modifying requirements. This area has received increasing attention. The paper reviews various research efforts undertaken along this line of research. The arguments in favor of goal orientation are first briefly discussed. The paper then compares the main approaches to goal modeling, goal specification and goal-based reasoning in the many activities of the requirements engineering process. To make the discussion more concrete, a real case study is used to suggest what a goal-oriented requirements engineering method may look like. Experience, with such approaches and tool support are briefly discussed as well","authors":["Axel van Lamsweerde"],"meta":["February 2001","DOI:10.1109/ISRE.2001.948567","SourceIEEE Xplore","Conference: Requirements Engineering, 2001.
