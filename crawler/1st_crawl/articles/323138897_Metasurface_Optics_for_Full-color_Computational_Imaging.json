{"id":"323138897_Metasurface_Optics_for_Full-color_Computational_Imaging","abstract":"Conventional imaging systems comprise large and expensive optical components that successively mitigate aberrations. Metasurface optics offers a route to miniaturize imaging systems by replacing bulky components with flat and compact implementations. The diffractive nature of these devices, however, induces severe chromatic aberrations, and current multiwavelength and narrowband achromatic metasurfaces cannot support full visible spectrum imaging (400 to 700 nm). We combine principles of both computational imaging and metasurface optics to build a system with a single metalens of numerical aperture ~0.45, which generates in-focus images under white light illumination. Our metalens exhibits a spectrally invariant point spread function that enables computational reconstruction of captured images with a single digital filter. This work connects computational imaging and metasurface optics and demonstrates the capabilities of combining these disciplines by simultaneously reducing aberrations and downsizing imaging systems using simpler optics.","authors":["Shane Colburn","Alan Zhan","Arka Majumdar"],"meta":["February 2018Science Advances 4(2):eaar2114","DOI:10.1126/sciadv.aar2114"],"references":["309700153_Miniature_optical_planar_camera_based_on_a_wide-angle_metasurface_doublet_corrected_for_monochromatic_aberrations","308834469_Metasurface_Freeform_Nanophotonics","308692722_Composite_Functional_Metasurfaces_for_Multispectral_Achromatic_Optics","307899318_Multiwavelength_metasurfaces_through_spatial_multiplexing","317703912_Planar_Metasurface_Retroreflector","317387403_Controlling_the_sign_of_chromatic_dispersion_in_diffractive_optics_with_dielectric_metasurfaces","312961648_Achromatic_Metalens_over_60_nm_Bandwidth_in_the_Visible_and_Metalens_with_Reverse_Chromatic_Dispersion","312771295_Image_quality_assessment_From_error_visibility_to_structural_similarity","305212638_Visible-Frequency_Dielectric_Metasurfaces_for_Multiwavelength_Achromatic_and_Highly_Dispersive_Holograms","303854909_Multispectral_Chiral_Imaging_with_a_Meta-lens"]}
