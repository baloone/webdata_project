Moreover, analytically closed formulae for these structures are determined.","authors":["Haidar Ali","Hafiz Muhammad Afzal Siddiqui","Muhammad Kashif Shafiq"],"meta":["September 2016"],"references":["310698005_Computing_Omega_Sadhana_and_PI_Polynomial_of_Benzoid_Carbon_Nanotubes","301659426_On_bipartite_edge_frustration_of_carbon_and_boron_nanotubes","284217734_On_Topological_Properties_of_Dominating_David_Derived_Networks","279749117_Computing_topological_polynomials_of_certain_nanostructures","273899189_On_Topological_Indices_of_Poly_Oxide_Poly_Silicate_DOX_and_DSL_Networks","262490136_Computation_of_topological_indices_of_certain_networks","253241066_On_molecular_graphs_with_smallest_and_greatest_zeroth-order_general_Randic_index","295875019_On_molecular_topological_properties_of_hex-derived_networks","267057070_Mathematical_Aspects_of_Randic-Type_Molecular_Structure_Descriptors","246775503_Mathatical_Concepts_in_Organic_Chemistry"]}
