{"id":"272199959_On_the_complexity_of_determining_the_irregular_chromatic_index_of_a_graph","abstract":"An undirected simple graph G is locally irregular if adjacent vertices of G have different degrees. An edge-colouring ϕ of G is locally irregular if each colour class of ϕ induces a locally irregular subgraph of G. The irregular chromatic index of G is the least number of colours used by a locally irregular edge-colouring of G (if any). We show that the problem of determining the irregular chromatic index of a graph can be handled in linear time when restricted to trees, but it remains NP-complete in general.","authors":["Olivier Baudon","Julien Bensmail","Eric Sopena"],"meta":["January 2015Journal of Discrete Algorithms 30","DOI:10.1016/j.jda.2014.12.008"],"references":["265701559_Irregular_networks","233730705_The_1-2-3_Conjecture_and_related_problems_a_survey","322812965_How_to_Define_an_Irregular_Graph","279648201_On_a_1_2_conjecture","275059329_On_decomposing_regular_graphs_into_locally_irregular_subgraphs","262321605_Algorithmic_complexity_of_proper_labeling_problems","242793334_Edge_weights_and_vertex_colors","228057735_Computers_And_Intractability_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness","227727521_Highly_irregular_graphs","220695890_Computers_and_Intracdtability_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness"]}
