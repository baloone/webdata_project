{"id":"262346128_Time-Efficient_Quantum_Walks_for_3-Distinctness","abstract":"We present two quantum walk algorithms for 3-Distinctness. Both algorithms have time complexity $\\tilde{O}(n^{5/7})$, improving the previous $\\tilde{O}(n^{3/4})$ and matching the best known upper bound for query complexity (obtained via learning graphs) up to log factors. The first algorithm is based on a connection between quantum walks and electric networks. The second algorithm uses an extension of the quantum walk search framework that facilitates quantum walks with nested updates.","authors":["Aleksandrs Belovs","Andrew M.
