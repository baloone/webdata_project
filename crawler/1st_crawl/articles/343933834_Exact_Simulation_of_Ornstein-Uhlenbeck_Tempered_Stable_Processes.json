{"id":"343933834_Exact_Simulation_of_Ornstein-Uhlenbeck_Tempered_Stable_Processes","abstract":"There are two types of tempered stable (TS) based Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) processes: 1) OU-TS process, the OU process driven by TS subordinator, and 2) TS-OU process, the OU process with TS marginal law. They have various applications in financial engineering and econometrics. In the literature, only the second type under the stationary assumption has an exact simulation algorithm. In this paper, we develop a unified approach to exactly simulate both types without the stationary assumption. It is mainly based on the distributional decomposition of stochastic processes with an aid of acceptance-rejection scheme. As the inverse Gaussian distribution is an important special case of TS distribution, we also provide tailored algorithms for the corresponding OU processes. Numerical experiments and tests are reported to demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of our algorithms, and some further extensions are also discussed.","authors":["Yan Qu","Angelos Dassios","Hongbiao Zhao"],"meta":["June 2021Journal of Applied Probability 58(2)","DOI:10.1017/jpr.2020.92","Project: Efficient Simulation in Financial Engineering and Actuarial Science"],"references":["349158674_Random_Variate_Generation_for_Exponential_and_Gamma_Tilted_Stable_Distributions","336564221_Exact_Simulation_of_Truncated_Levy_Subordinator","335079172_Exact_Simulation_of_Gamma-driven_Ornstein-Uhlenbeck_Processes_with_Finite_and_Infinite_Activity_Jumps","333682397_Efficient_Simulation_of_Levy-driven_Point_Processes","322910260_Exact_Simulation_for_a_Class_of_Tempered_Stable_and_Related_Distributions","316342918_Efficient_Simulation_of_Clustering_Jumps_with_CIR_Intensity","313606950_Normal_modified_stable_processes","305978401_Some_stationary_processes_in_discrete_and_continuous_time","305978232_A_characterization_of_stable_processes","305977298_A_dynamic_contagion_process"]}
