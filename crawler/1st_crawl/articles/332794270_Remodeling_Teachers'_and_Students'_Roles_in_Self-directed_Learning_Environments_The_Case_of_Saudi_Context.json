{"id":"332794270_Remodeling_Teachers'_and_Students'_Roles_in_Self-directed_Learning_Environments_The_Case_of_Saudi_Context","abstract":"Traditional classrooms are markedly teacher-centered. EFL learners are largely urged to commit themselves to communicative learning environments which help them enhance their language performance. Self-directed learning is one of the approaches which proved to be highly effective in Foreign Language Learning (FLL). EFL teachers are usually encouraged to adopt self-directed learning practices in order to improve students’ linguistic competence and performance. Recently, many Saudi universities integrated self-directed learning mode into EFL instruction. However, students' language performance, which is crucial to finding a job opportunity in labor market, is below the desired level. The study aims at remodeling teachers' and students' roles in light of students’ perceptions of English self-directed learning. To achieve this ultimate goal, a questionnaire survey is administered and follow-up semi-structured interviews are held. Results showed that both male and female students have generally positive attitudes towards self-directed learning. However, many of them have real problems with understanding the nature of self-directed learning and how they should use it effectively. Therefore, both institutions and teachers are recommended to improve students’ understanding and awareness of self-directed learning modes, and to rethink their roles.","authors":["Iman El-Nabawi Abdel Wahed Shaalan"],"meta":["May 2019Journal of Language Teaching and Research 10(3):549","DOI:10.17507/jltr.1003.19"],"references":["326264857_Improving_EFL_Students'_Speaking_Proficiency_and_Motivation_A_Hybrid_Problem-based_Learning_Approach","325657887_Self-directed_learning_readiness_of_Indian_medical_students_A_mixed_method_study","312658268_Edmodo_Use_to_Develop_Saudi_EFL_Students'_Self-Directed_Learning","311917843_Relationship_between_Student's_Self-Directed-Learning_Readiness_and_Academic_Self-Efficacy_and_Achievement_Motivation_in_Students","288516804_Focus_on_the_language_learner_Motivation_styles_and_strategies","272830096_Self-Directed_Learning_A_Tool_for_Lifelong_Learning","271881037_The_Effect_of_Teaching_Cognitive_and_Metacognitive_Strategies_on_EFL_Students'_Reading_Comprehension_Across_Proficiency_Levels","250699716_A_Conceptual_Model_for_Understanding_Self-Directed_Learning_in_Online_Environments","232512697_The_relation_of_interest_to_the_motivation_of_behavior_A_self-determination_theory_perspective","11441809_Self-directed_learning_Looking_at_outcomes_with_medical_students","330478540_Self-Direction_in_Adult_Learning_Perspectives_on_Theory_Research_and_Practice","303024746_Self-directed_learning","289204243_What's_new_in_autonomy","285106589_Self-determination_theory_and_the_facilitation_of_intrinsic_motivation_social_Schwartz_S_H_1977","279450306_How_can_Independent_Learning_Centres_mediate_language_learning_and_communication","271818911_Information_Literacy_A_Framework_for_Higher_Education","268205175_ESL_Learners'_Perceptions_and_Practice_in_Self-directed_Language_Learning","263412966_From_adult_education_to_lifelong_learning_and_beyond","250612816_The_Relationship_between_Self-Directed_Learning_and_Information_Literacy_among_Adult_Learners_in_Higher_Education","249698949_Self-Directed_Adult_Learning_A_Critical_Paradigm","248983139_Learning-to-learn_strategies_as_a_basis_for_effective_lifelong_learning","247481174_Self-Direction_for_Lifelong_Learning_A_Comprehensive_Guide_to_Theory_and_Practice","243783747_Language_Learning_Strategies_What_Every_Teacher_Should_Know","242143635_Perspectives_on_Self-Directed_Learning_-_the_Importance_of_Attitudes_and_Skills","226060387_Individual_Differences_in_Second_and_Foreign_Language_Learning","49494833_Fundamental_Concepts_of_Language_Teaching","44820935_The_Management_of_independent_learning"]}
