{"id":"328084768_Model-Based_Software_Engineering_A_Multiple-Case_Study_on_Challenges_and_Development_Efforts","abstract":"A recurring theme in discussions about the adoption of Model-Based Engineering (MBE) is its effectiveness. This is because there is a lack of empirical assessment of the processes and (tool-)use of MBE in practice. We conducted a multiple-case study by observing 2 two-month MBE projects from which software for a Mars rover were developed. We focused on assessing the distribution of the total software development effort over different development activities. Moreover, we observed and collected challenges reported by the developers during the execution of projects. We found that the majority of the effort is spent on the collaboration and communication activities. Furthermore, our inquiry into challenges showed that tool-related challenges are the most encountered.","authors":["Rodi Jolak","Truong Ho-Quang","Michel R. V.
