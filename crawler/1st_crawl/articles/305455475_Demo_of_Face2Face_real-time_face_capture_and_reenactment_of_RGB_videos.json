{"id":"305455475_Demo_of_Face2Face_real-time_face_capture_and_reenactment_of_RGB_videos","abstract":"We present a novel approach for real-time facial reenactment of a monocular target video sequence (e.g., Youtube video). The source sequence is also a monocular video stream, captured live with a commodity webcam. Our goal is to animate the facial expressions of the target video by a source actor and re-render the manipulated output video in a photo-realistic fashion. To this end, we first address the under-constrained problem of facial identity recovery from monocular video by non-rigid model-based bundling. At run time, we track facial expressions of both source and target video using a dense photometric consistency measure. Reenactment is then achieved by fast and efficient deformation transfer between source and target. The mouth interior that best matches the re-targeted expression is retrieved from the target sequence and warped to produce an accurate fit. Finally, we convincingly re-render the synthesized target face on top of the corresponding video stream such that it seamlessly blends with the real-world illumination. We demonstrate our method in a live setup, where Youtube videos are reen-acted in real time.","authors":["Justus Thies","Michael Zollh√∂fer","Marc Stamminger","Christian Theobalt"],"meta":["July 2016","DOI:10.1145/2929464.2929475","Conference: ACM SIGGRAPH 2016 Emerging Technologies"],"references":["311610313_Face2Face_Real-Time_Face_Capture_and_Reenactment_of_RGB_Videos"]}
