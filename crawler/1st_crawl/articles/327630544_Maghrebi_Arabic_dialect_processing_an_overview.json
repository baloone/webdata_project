{"id":"327630544_Maghrebi_Arabic_dialect_processing_an_overview","abstract":"Natural Language Processing for Arabic dialects has grown widely these last years. Indeed, several works were proposed dealing with all aspects of Natural Language Processing. However, some AD varieties have received more attention and have a growing collection of resources. Others varieties, such as Maghrebi, still lag behind in that respect. Maghrebi Arabic is the family of Arabic dialects spoken in the Maghreb region (principally Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco). In this work we are interested in these three languages. This paper presents a review of natural language processing for Maghrebi Arabic dialects.","authors":["Salima Harrat","Karima Meftouh","Kamel Sma√Øli"],"meta":["March 2018International Journal of Science Education 1:38","Project: Modern Standard Arabic and Dialects"],"references":["342420693_PHONETIC_TOOL_FOR_THE_TUNISIAN_ARABIC","339384972_The_identification_of_two_Algerian_Arabic_dialects_by_prosodic_focus","325618164_Morphologically_Annotated_Corpora_and_Morphological_Analyzers_for_Moroccan_and_Sanaani_Yemeni_Arabic","313035715_Morphological_Disambiguation_of_Tunisian_Dialect","312039953_A_Proposed_Lexicon-Based_Sentiment_Analysis_Approach_for_the_Vernacular_Algerian_Arabic","307583782_Spoken_Tunisian_Arabic_Corpus_STAC_Transcription_and_Annotation","306244874_Maghrebian_dialect_recognition_based_on_support_vector_machines_and_neural_network_classifiers","303860296_Exploiting_Emoticons_to_Generate_Emotional_Dictionaries_from_Facebook_Pages","300583066_Fine-Grained_POS_Tagging_of_Spoken_Tunisian_Dialect_Corpora","300254033_Constructing_Linguistic_Resources_for_the_Tunisian_Dialect_Using_Textual_User-Generated_Contents_on_the_Social_Web"]}
