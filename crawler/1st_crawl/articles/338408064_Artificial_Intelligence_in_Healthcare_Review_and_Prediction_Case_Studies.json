{"id":"338408064_Artificial_Intelligence_in_Healthcare_Review_and_Prediction_Case_Studies","abstract":"Artificial intelligence (AI) has been developing rapidly in recent years in terms of software algorithms, hardware implementation, and applications in a vast number of areas. In this review, we summarize the latest developments of applications of AI in biomedicine, including disease diagnostics, living assistance, biomedical information processing, and biomedical research. The aim of this review is to keep track of new scientific accomplishments, to understand the availability of technologies, to appreciate the tremendous potential of AI in biomedicine, and to provide researchers in related fields with inspiration. It can be asserted that, just like AI itself, the application of AI in biomedicine is still in its early stage. New progress and breakthroughs will continue to push the frontier and widen the scope of AI application, and fast developments are envisioned in the near future. Two case studies are provided to illustrate the prediction of epileptic seizure occurrences and the filling of a dysfunctional urinary bladder.","authors":["Guoguang Rong","Arnaldo Mendez","Elie Bou Assi","Bo Zhao"],"meta":["January 2020Engineering 6(3)","DOI:10.1016/j.eng.2019.08.015"],"references":["331639316_Global_Evolution_of_Research_in_Artificial_Intelligence_in_Health_and_Medicine_A_Bibliometric_Study","328390098_Bispectrum_Features_and_Multilayer_Perceptron_Classifier_to_Enhance_Seizure_Prediction","327944786_Literature-based_automated_discovery_of_tumor_suppressor_p53_phosphorylation_and_inhibition_by_NEK2","327927437_Prediction_of_Compound_Profiling_Matrices_Part_II_Relative_Performance_of_Multitask_Deep_Learning_and_Random_Forest_Classification_on_the_Basis_of_Varying_Amounts_of_Training_Data","345648931_Trends_in_biomedical_signal_feature_extraction","335602729_Predicting_urinary_bladder_voiding_by_means_of_a_linear_discriminant_analysis_Validation_in_rats","331665604_Effective_Connectivity_Analysis_of_iEEG_and_Accurate_Localization_of_the_Epileptogenic_Focus_at_the_Onset_of_Operculo-Insular_Seizures","329278392_Machine_learning_studies_on_major_brain_diseases_5-year_trends_of_2014-2018","328200067_Artificial_intelligence_in_healthcare","327878958_Integrate-and-fire_neuron_circuit_using_positive_feedback_field_effect_transistor_for_low_power_operation"]}
