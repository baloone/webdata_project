{"id":"221583488_Primality_Testing_with_Gaussian_Periods","abstract":"We exhibit a deterministic algorithm that, for some eectiv ely computable real number c, decides whether a given integer n>1 is prime within time (log n),. The same result, with 21=2 in the place of 6, was recently proved by Agrawal, Kayal, and Saxena. Our algorithm follows the same pattern as theirs, performing computations in an auxiliary ring extension of Z=nZ. We allow our rings to be generated by Gaussian periods rather than by roots of unity, which leaves us greater freedom in the selection of the auxiliary parameters,and enables,us to obtain a better run time estimate. The proof depends on newly,developed results in analytic number theory and on the following theorem from additive number theory, which was provided by D. Bleichenbacher: if t is a real number with 0","authors":["Hendrik Lenstra"],"meta":["December 2002","DOI:10.1007/3-540-36206-1_1","SourceDBLP","Conference: FST TCS 2002: Foundations of Software Technology and Theoretical Computer Science, 22nd Conference Kanpur, India, December 12-14, 2002, Proceedings"],"references":["221591460_Finding_Irreducible_Polynomials_over_Finite_Fields","2742894_There_are_Infinitely_Many_Carmichael_Numbers","266013884_Multiplicative_Number_Theory","265332596_On_the_Brun-Titchmarsh_theorem_on_average","264945958_Modern_Computer_Algebra","256258231_Proof_of_a_conjecture_by_Erdos_and_Graham_concerning_the_problem_of_Frobenius","247510812_Shifted_primes_without_large_prime_factors","239060590_Prime_Numbers_A_Computational_Perspective","226097645_The_vinogradov-Bombieri_theorem","225837746_Kloosterman_sums_and_Fourier_coefficients_of_cusp_forms","223149848_Structure_Theorem_for_Multiple_Addition_and_the_Frobenius_Problem","2904807_The_Continuous_Postage_Problem","2832164_Smooth_Orders_and_Cryptographic_Applications"]}
