{"id":"308277412_Single_Image_Dehazing_via_Multi-scale_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","abstract":"The performance of existing image dehazing methods is limited by hand-designed features, such as the dark channel, color disparity and maximum contrast, with complex fusion schemes. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale deep neural network for single-image dehazing by learning the mapping between hazy images and their corresponding transmission maps. The proposed algorithm consists of a coarse-scale net which predicts a holistic transmission map based on the entire image, and a fine-scale net which refines results locally. To train the multi-scale deep network, we synthesize a dataset comprised of hazy images and corresponding transmission maps based on the NYU Depth dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world images in terms of quality and speed.","authors":["Wenqi Ren","Si Liu","Hua Zhang","Jinshan Pan"],"meta":["October 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-46475-6_10","Conference: European Conference on Computer Vision"],"references":["282358140_Nighttime_Haze_Removal_with_Glow_and_Multiple_Light_Colors","282357998_Nighttime_Haze_Removal_with_Glow_and_Multiple_Light_Colors","279194502_Simultaneous_Video_Defogging_and_Stereo_Reconstruction","278968835_A_Fast_Single_Image_Haze_Removal_Algorithm_Using_Color_Attenuation_Prior","274644994_Matching-CNN_Meets_KNN_Quasi-Parametric_Human_Parsing","273388035_Deep_Human_Parsing_with_Active_Template_Regression","270454670_Image_Super-Resolution_Using_Deep_Convolutional_Networks","269935213_Half-CNN_A_General_Framework_for_Whole-Image_Regression","264552416_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","262380249_Automatic_Feature_Learning_for_Robust_Shadow_Detection","261225195_Markov_Random_Field_Model_for_Single_Image_Defogging","236228168_Guided_Image_Filtering","224136067_Factorizing_Scene_Albedo_and_Depth_from_a_Single_Foggy_Image","221364396_Polarization_Beneficial_for_visibility_enhancement","221363624_Towards_Fog-Free_In-Vehicle_Vision_Systems_through_Contrast_Restoration","221362812_Visibility_in_bad_weather_from_a_single_image","221110862_Fast_Visibility_Restoration_from_a_Single_Color_or_Gray_Level_Image","220745423_A_Fast_Semi-Inverse_Approach_to_Detect_and_Remove_the_Haze_from_a_Single_Image","46158497_Single_Image_Haze_Removal_Using_Dark_Channel_Prior","4268963_Visibility_Enhancement_for_Roads_with_Foggy_or_Hazy_Scenes","2985446_Gradient-Based_Learning_Applied_to_Document_Recognition","319770198_Learning_a_Deep_Convolutional_Network_for_Image_Super-Resolution","314100361_Indoor_Segmentation_and_Support_Inference_from_RGBD_Images","313086331_A_Taxonomy_And_Evaluation_Of_Dense_Two-Frame_Stereo_Correspondence_Algorithms","311610604_SketchNet_Sketch_Classification_with_Web_Images","308838670_Matching-CNN_meets_KNN_Quasi-parametric_human_parsing","307584319_Nighttime_haze_removal_based_on_a_new_imaging_model","286594615_Investigating_Haze-Relevant_Features_in_a_Learning_Framework_for_Image_Dehazing","273188249_Dehazing_Using_Color-Lines","268585686_Deep_photo","262974294_Depth_Map_Prediction_from_a_Single_Image_using_a_Multi-Scale_Deep_Network","262380239_Automatic_feature_learning_for_robust_shadow_detection","262356211_Efficient_Image_Dehazing_with_Boundary_Constraint_and_Contextual_Regularization","262222168_Indoor_Segmentation_and_Support_Inference_from_RGBD_Images","261387111_Nighttime_haze_removal_using_color_transfer_pre-processing_and_Dark_Channel_Prior","257672344_Bayesian_Defogging","241638187_Vision_Enhancement_in_Homogeneous_and_Heterogeneous_Fog","236837518_Single_Image_Dehazing_by_Multi-Scale_Fusion","234794112_Deep_Photo_Model-Based_Photograph_Enhancement_and_Viewing","225636510_A_Taxonomy_and_Evaluation_of_Dense_Two-Frame_Stereo_Correspondence_Algorithms","224989203_Evaluation_of_Cost_Functions_for_Stereo_Matching","220184320_Single_image_dehazing","51623717_An_Investigation_of_Dehazing_Effects_on_Image_and_Video_Coding","4246249_Blind_Haze_Separation","4022931_High-accuracy_stereo_depth_maps_using_structured_light","3940554_Instant_dehazing_of_images_using_polarization","3854198_Chromatic_framework_for_vision_in_bad_weather","3193559_Contrast_restoration_of_weather_degraded_images"]}
