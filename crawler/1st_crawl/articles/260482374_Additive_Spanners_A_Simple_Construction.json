{"id":"260482374_Additive_Spanners_A_Simple_Construction","abstract":"We consider additive spanners of unweighted undirected graphs. Let G be a graph and H a subgraph of G. The most naïve way to construct an additive k-spanner of G is the following: As long as H is not an additive k-spanner repeat: Find a pair (u,v) ∈ H that violates the spanner-condition and a shortest path from u to v in G. Add the edges of this path to H.\nWe show that, with a very simple initial graph H, this naïve method gives additive 6- and 2-spanners of sizes matching the best known upper bounds. For additive 2-spanners we start with H = ∅ and end with O(n\n3/2) edges in the spanner. For additive 6-spanners we start with H containing \\(\\lfloor n^{1/3} \\rfloor\\) arbitrary edges incident to each node and end with a spanner of size O(n\n4/3).","authors":["Mathias Bæk Tejs Knudsen"],"meta":["March 2014","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-08404-6_24","SourcearXiv","Conference: Scandinavian Workshop on Algorithm Theory"],"references":["234785685_New_constructions_of_a_b-spanners_and_purely_additive_spanners","286169692_New_Additive_Spanners","234802032_1_eB_-spanner_constructions_for_general_graphs","228057622_All_Pairs_Almost_Shortest_Paths","227064104_Low_Distortion_Spanners","221499080_Lower_Bounds_for_Additive_Spanners_Emulators_and_More","220779411_Spanners_and_emulators_with_sublinear_distance_errors","220618243_1_epsilonbeta-Spanner_Constructions_for_General_Graphs","3671935_All_pairs_almost_shortest_paths"]}
