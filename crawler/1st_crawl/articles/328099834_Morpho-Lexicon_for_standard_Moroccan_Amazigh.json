{"id":"328099834_Morpho-Lexicon_for_standard_Moroccan_Amazigh","abstract":"Standardized resources are key components for the development of applications related to human language technology. Therefore, it is important to adopt it for designing lexical resources, especially for less commonly resourced languages such Amazigh. This language is spoken by many North African communities, including Morocco. Due to historical, geographical and sociolinguistic factors, the Amazigh language is characterized by the proliferation of many intervarieties, which has led to a complex morphology. This latter poses significant challenge to NLP tasks, especially that Amazigh language belongs to the Afro-Asiatic language (Hamito-Semitic) family, known by its non-concatenative morphology based on root and pattern.\nFace to the scarcity of Amazigh language resources dealing with morphemes encoding, orthographic changes, and morphotactic variations, the elaboration of a standardized lexical resource will certainly ensure a large exchange and exploitation. In this context, this paper describes ongoing work for elaborating a morphological lexicon, based on inflected forms, for the standard Moroccan Amazigh language.","authors":["Fadoua Ataa Allah","Siham Boulaknadel"],"meta":["January 2018MATEC Web of Conferences 210:04024","DOI:10.1051/matecconf/201821004024"],"references":["274898130_Amazigh_Noun_Inflection_in_the_Universal_Networking_Language","272790663_Jeu_d'etiquettes_morphosyntaxiques_de_la_langue_amazighe","272790410_La_promotion_de_l'amazighe_a_travers_les_technologies_de_l'information_et_de_la_communication","269087963_Standards_going_concrete","267213152_Finite-state_transducer_for_Amazigh_verbal_morphology","235763185_Toward_Computational_Processing_of_Less_Resourced_Languages_Primarily_Experiments_for_Moroccan_Amazigh_Language","275870379_Languages_of_West_Africa","260718984_LMF_Lexical_Markup_Framework"]}
