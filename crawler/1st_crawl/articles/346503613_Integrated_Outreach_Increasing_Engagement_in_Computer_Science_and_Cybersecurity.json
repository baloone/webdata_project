{"id":"346503613_Integrated_Outreach_Increasing_Engagement_in_Computer_Science_and_Cybersecurity","abstract":"Research on innovative, integrated outreach programs guided three separate week-long outreach camps held across two summers (2018 and 2019). These camps introduced computer science through real-world applications and hands-on activities, each dealing with cybersecurity principles. The camps utilized low-cost hardware and free software to provide a total of 84 students (aged 10 to 18 years) a unique learning experience. Based on feedback from the 2018 camp, a new pre/post survey was developed to assess changes in participant knowledge and interest. Student participants in the 2019 iteration showed drastic changes in their cybersecurity content recall (33% pre vs. 96% post), cybersecurity concept identification within real-world scenarios, and exhibited an increased ability to recognize potential cybersecurity threats in their everyday lives (22% pre vs. 69% post). Finally, students' self-reported interest-level before and after the camp show a positive increase across all student participants, with the number of students who where highly interested in cybersecurity more than doubling from 31% pre-camp to 65% post-camp. Implications for educators are large as these activities and experiences can be interwoven into traditional schooling as well as less formal camps as pure computer science or through integrated STEM.","authors":["Shaya Wolf","Andrea Burrows","Mike Borowczak","Mason Johnson"],"meta":["November 2020Education Sciences 10(12):23","DOI:10.3390/educsci10120353","Project: Cybersecurity & CS Education And Research"],"references":["337059272_Building_Collaboration_and_Securing_Interest_in_Computer_Science_Education_through_Outreach_Opportunities","332062131_Ants_Go_Marching-Integrating_Computer_Science_into_Teacher_Professional_Development_with_NetLogo","325406712_Do_outreach_activities_in_secondary_STEM_education_motivate_students_and_improve_their_attitudes_towards_STEM","345935066_The_Impact_Of_K_12_Outreach_Programs_On_Graduate_And_Undergraduate_Experiences","344545120_The_Impact_Of_Out_Of_School_Time_Ost_Math_And_Science_Clubs_On_Elementary_And_Middle_School_Students_Teachers_Schools_And_The_Undergraduate_And_Graduate_Fellows_That_Facilitate_Them","341358612_Authentic_science_experiences_with_STEM_datasets_Post-secondary_results_and_potential_gender_influences","336143372_Projections_overview_and_highlights_2018-28","330424732_Computer_science_and_engineering_utilizing_action_research_and_lesson_study","328739521_Computer_Science_Outreach_Workshop_and_Interest_Development_A_Longitudinal_Study","326596859_Towards_a_socio-ecological_framework_to_address_gender_inequity_in_computer_science"]}
