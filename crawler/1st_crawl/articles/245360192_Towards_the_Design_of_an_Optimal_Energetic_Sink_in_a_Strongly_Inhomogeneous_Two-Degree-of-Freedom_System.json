{"id":"245360192_Towards_the_Design_of_an_Optimal_Energetic_Sink_in_a_Strongly_Inhomogeneous_Two-Degree-of-Freedom_System","abstract":"Analytical, numerical, and experimental results of energy pumping in a strongly inhomogeneous two-degree-of-freedom system are to be presented in this study. The latter is based both on efficient analytical solution and comparative analysis for various types of energetic sinks. Considering the efficient pumping process as damped beating with strong energy transfer, it is shown that we can design the sinks with amplitude-phase variables which provide the most efficient result. In this study, the main types of energetic sinks are to be compared. Computer simulation has confirmed the analytical predictions which had been obtained. Experimental verification of the analytical prediction is considered for a particular type of sink.","authors":["L. I. Manevitch","Emmanuel Gourdon","C.H.
