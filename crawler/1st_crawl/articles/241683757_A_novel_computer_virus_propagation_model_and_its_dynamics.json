{"id":"241683757_A_novel_computer_virus_propagation_model_and_its_dynamics","abstract":"By taking into account the fact that, in general, a computer immediately possesses infectivity as soon as it is infected, a novel computer virus propagation model, known as the SLBS model, is established. It is proved that the dynamic behaviour of the model is determined by a threshold R0. Specifically, the virus-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable if R0â‰¤1, whereas the virulent equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable if 14. These results suggest some effective strategies for eradicating computer viruses distributed in the Internet.","authors":["Lu-Xing Yang","Xiaofan Yang","Luosheng Wen","Jiming Liu"],"meta":["November 2012International Journal of Computer Mathematics 89(17):1-8","DOI:10.1080/00207160.2012.715388"],"references":["223458007_SEIRS_epidemic_model_with_delay_for_transmission_of_malicious_objects_in_computer_network","257591026_A_novel_computer_virus_model_and_its_dynamics","251678614_Global_stability_of_an_epidemic_model_with_latent_stage_and_vaccination","251627224_Delayed_computer_virus_propagation_model_and_its_dynamics","243785180_The_Art_of_Computer_Virus_Research_and_Defense","235899026_Fuzzy_epidemic_model_for_the_transmission_of_worms_in_computer_network","223929513_Stability_analysis_of_a_SEIQV_epidemic_model_for_rapid_spreading_worms","223450356_A_modifed_epidemiological_model_for_computer_viruses","223248954_Fixed_period_of_temporary_immunity_after_run_of_anti-malicious_software_on_computer_nodes","222943961_SEIQRS_model_for_the_transmission_of_malicious_objects_in_computer_network","222803069_Network_virus-epidemic_model_with_the_point-to-group_information_propagation","222447707_Computer_Viruses-Theory_and_Experiments","220558096_Dynamic_model_of_worms_with_vertical_transmission_in_computer_network","220557732_Dynamical_behavior_of_computer_virus_on_Internet","27298115_An_Introduction_to_Dynamical_Systems_Continuous_and_Discrete","2999039_Computers_and_epidemiology"]}
