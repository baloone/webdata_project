{"id":"263367902_Hoeffding-CF_Neighbourhood-Based_Recommendations_on_Reliably_Similar_Users","abstract":"Neighbourhood-based collaborative filtering recommenders exploit the common ratings among users to identify a user’s most similar neighbours. It is known that decisions made on a naive computation of user similarity are unreliable, because the number of co-ratings varies strongly among users. In this paper, we formalize the notion of reliable similarity between two users and propose a method that constructs a user’s neighbourhood by selecting only those users that are reliably similar to her. Our method combines a statistical test and the notion of a baseline user. We report our results on typical benchmark datasets.\n\nAuthor's copy available here:\nhttp://www.pawelmatuszyk.com/download/MatuszykSpiliopoulou14.pdf\nThe final publication is available at Springer via http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-08786-3_13","authors":["Pawel Matuszyk","Myra Spiliopoulou"],"meta":["July 2014","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-08786-3_13","Conference: Conference on User Modelling, Adaptation and Personalization (UMAP 14)At: Aalborg, Denmark"],"references":["226264572_Evaluating_Recommendation_Systems","221549003_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","221299721_Effective_missing_data_prediction_for_collaborative_filtering","221136042_Locally_Adaptive_Neighborhood_Selection_for_Collaborative_Filtering_Recommendations","234794211_Recommender_Systems_Handbook","228057769_Probability_Inequalities_for_Sums_of_Bounded_Random_Variables","221654180_Research_Track_Paper_Modeling_Relationships_at_Multiple_Scales_to_Improve_Accuracy_of_Large_Recommender_Systems","221300972_An_algorithmic_framework_for_performing_collaborative_filtering","221299468_An_automatic_weighting_scheme_for_collaborative_filtering","2834957_Mining_High-Speed_Data_Streams"]}
