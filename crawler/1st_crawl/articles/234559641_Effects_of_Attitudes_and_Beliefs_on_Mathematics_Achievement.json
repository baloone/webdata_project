{"id":"234559641_Effects_of_Attitudes_and_Beliefs_on_Mathematics_Achievement","abstract":"Examined predictors of attitudes and beliefs related to school and family and predictors of mathematics outcomes focusing on attitudes using data from the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS). Tested a model derived from Cyprus TIMSS data on U.S. and Japanese data. Findings highlight the complexity of factors accounting for mathematics achievement.
