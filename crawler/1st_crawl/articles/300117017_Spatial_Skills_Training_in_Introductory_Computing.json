{"id":"300117017_Spatial_Skills_Training_in_Introductory_Computing","abstract":"This paper explores the question as to whether there is a relationship between a student's spatial abilities and her achievement in learning to program. After noting that there does seem to be a correlation, the paper explores the impact of trying to improve a student's spatial abilities. The paper reports on a preliminary study involving high school students. The study results suggest a correlation exists between receiving training in spatial skills and improved student performance in introductory computing. While the sample size in the study is small, this improvement appears to occur for students of different races/ethnicities and across different socio-economic statuses.","authors":["Stephen Cooper","Karen Wang","Maya Israni","Sheryl Sorby"],"meta":["July 2015","DOI:10.1145/2787622.2787728","Conference: the eleventh annual International Conference"],"references":["259843883_Programmed_to_succeed_A_multi-national_multi-institutional_study_of_introductory_programming_courses","255744217_Structural_chemistry_and_spatial_ability_in_different_cultures","250767761_Spatial_Ability_And_Learning_To_Program","234726667_Spatial_Visualization-A_Gateway_to_Computer-Based_Technology","232436712_Predictors_of_Educational_Attainment_in_the_Chicago_Longitudinal_Study","229462132_Gender_Differences_in_Student_Attitudes_Toward_Science_A_Meta-Analysis_of_the_Literature_from_1970_to_1991","227660049_Individual_Differences_in_Use_of_External_Visualisations_to_Perform_an_Internal_Visualisation_Task","226530021_Sex_differences_in_spatial_ability_and_spatial_activities","226124310_The_Role_of_Parents_and_Teachers_in_the_Development_of_Gender-Related_Math_Attitudes","221538824_Evaluating_the_effectiveness_of_a_new_instructional_approach","221307473_Using_Sex_Differences_to_Link_Spatial_Cognition_and_Program_Comprehension","47642285_New_Trends_in_Gender_and_Mathematics_Performance_A_Meta-Analysis","16129477_Spatial_Ability_in_Androgen-Deficient_Men","317623860_The_Psychology_of_Sex_Differences","309456367_An_Analysis_of_Variance_Test_for_Normality_Complete_Samples","297173670_MICROCOMPUTER_LEARNING_IN_SMALL-GROUPS_-_COGNITIVE_REQUIREMENTS_AND_GROUP_PROCESSES","289963662_The_Psychology_of_Sex_Differences","275845534_Experiences_in_Visual_Thinking","275022349_Developing_Spatial_Thinking","270585193_Visible_Learning_A_Synthesis_of_Over_800_Meta-Analyses_Relating_to_Achievement","269803774_Raumliches_Vorstellungsvermogen_-","261876347_Psychometric_properties_of_the_revised_Purdue_Spatial_Visualization_Tests_Visualization_of_Rotations_The_Revised_PSVTR","254464158_A_Statewide_survey_on_computing_education_pathways_and_influences_Factors_in_broadening_participation_in_computing","252166430_Assessing_and_Improving_the_Below_Average_Visualization_Abilities_of_a_Group_of_Minority_Engineering_and_Technology_Students","250183881_Sex-Related_Differences_in_Mathematics_Achievement_Spatial_Visualization_and_Affective_Factors","248916149_Spatial_Ability_Its_Educational_and_Social_Significance","247300241_Purdue_Spatial_Visualization_Test","246052407_Emergence_and_Characterization_of_Sex_Differences_in_Spatial_Ability_A_Meta-Analysis","239830109_Psychometric_properties_of_the_Revised_Purdue_Spatial_Visualization_Tests_Visualization_of_Rotations_the_Revised_PSVTR","234602926_A_Course_for_the_Development_of_3-D_Spatial_Visualization_Skills","234560309_Sexual_Stereotyping_and_Mathematics_Learning","234486222_a_Course_in_Spatial_Visualization_and_its_Impact_on_the_Retention_of_Female_Engineering_Students","232595584_Microcomputer_Learning_in_Small_Groups_Cognitive_Requirements_and_Group_Processes","232509010_How_Large_Are_Cognitive_Gender_Differences_A_Meta-Analysis_Using_o2_and_D","232440752_Spatial_and_Numerical_Predictors_of_Measurement_Performance_The_Moderating_Effects_of_Community_Income_and_Gender","228824383_A_course_in_spatial_visualisation","224088907_Examining_science_and_engineering_students'_attitudes_toward_computer_science","220807265_Spatial_skills_and_navigation_of_source_code","220426367_Learning_to_Program_and_Learning_to_Think_What's_the_Connection","200806332_An_Analysis_of_Variance_Test_for_Normality","20088916_The_Measurement_of_Social_Class_in_Epidemiology","19086027_Emergence_and_Characterization_of_Sex_Differences_in_Spatial_Ability_A_Meta-Analysis","7504001_Socioeconomic_Status_Modifies_the_Sex_Difference_in_Spatial_Skill"]}
