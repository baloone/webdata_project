{"id":"27472555_Service-learning_informing_the_development_of_an_inclusive_ethical_framework_for_beginning_teachers","abstract":"A social-cultural theory of difference informed the development of a university unit on inclusive education with a focus on broadening students' experience and understanding about the backgrounds and values of people in society. One of the aims of the unit was to \"develop and work within legal and ethical frameworks that promote diversity, equity and inclusive education\". This paper will report on pre-service teacher reflections in Service-learning Program Logs associated with a university unit on inclusive education in Queensland, Australia. Service-learning requires students to become involved in their community in order to utilise knowledge learned at university. The programme involves reciprocal relationships with organisations in which the sevice reinforces and strengthens the learning in the academic unit on inclusive education, and the learning reinforces and strengthens the service. Analysis of data presented in this paper informed the development of set of principles of an inclusive ethical framework. We suggest that these principles could be further developed in teacher education programmes to progress inclusive practices in schools.","authors":["Suzanne Carrington","Beth Saggers"],"meta":["April 2008Teaching and Teacher Education 24(3)","DOI:10.1016/j.tate.2007.09.006"],"references":["303382459_Conceptions_of_Reflective_Teaching_in_Contemporary_US_Teacher_Education_Program_Reforms","257245711_Subjective_experience_and_the_preparation_of_activist_teachers_Confronting_the_mean_old_snapping_turtle_and_the_great_big_bear","242537621_Teacher_Reflection_in_a_Hall_of_Mirrors_Historical_Influences_and_Political_Reverberations","239442844_Beyond_the_Methods_Fetish_Toward_a_Humanizing_Pedagogy","238622756_Toward_a_New_Framework_of_Server_and_Served_Deand_Reconstructing_Reciprocity_in_Service-learning_Pedagogy","225122072_Dreaming_our_future_Developing_democratic_professional_practice","37621426_The_Queensland_School_Reform_Longitudinal_Study","27464126_Inclusion_needs_a_different_school_culture","340416593_Changing_Theories_and_Practices_of_Discipline","329708362_Introduction_Inclusion_and_Innovation","313390246_Basics_of_qualitative_research_Grounded_theory_procedures_and_techniques","305061226_Using_journal_writing_to_enhance_reflective_practice","287726388_Storying_the_self_Life_politics_and_the_study_of_the_teacher's_life_and_work","271808576_Implementing_Service_Learning_in_Higher_Education","249914369_Making_the_Difference_Then_and_Now","249704487_Characteristics_of_Reflective_Thought_During_the_Student_Teaching_Experience","248938926_What_a_difference_mentoring_makes_Service_learning_and_engagement_for_college_students","245581479_Basics_Of_Qualitative_Research_Grounded_Theory_Procedures_And_Techniques","242219751_Inclusive_education_and_teacher_education_A_basis_for_hope_or_a_discourse_of_delusion","234675862_Deconstructing_Service-Learning_Research_Exploring_Context_Participation_and_Impacts_Advances_in_Service-Learning_Research","234611824_The_Power_of_Linking_Service_to_Learning","229100778_In_Good_Company_How_Social_Capital_Makes_Organizations_Work","227498622_Using_journal_writing_to_enhance_reflective_practice_Promoting_journal_writing_in_adult_education","221931879_Designing_Qualitative_Research","49546499_The_Theory_of_Communicative_Action","45243552_The_Critical_Pedagogy_Reader","38184132_Schools_and_Diversity_2nd_ed","27478720_Classroom_Relationships_Pedagogy_and_Practice_in_the_Inclusive_Classroom","27478535_Developing_an_Inclusive_School_Culture","13728454_Service-learning_Community-campus_partnerships_for_health_professions_education"]}
