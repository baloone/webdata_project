{"id":"342387705_Target_Set_Selection_on_generalized_pancake_graphs","abstract":"Target Set Selection (TSS) was initially proposed to study the problem of the spread of information, ideas or influence through a social network and had formulated many problems arising in various practical applications. We consider a particular type of graphs, namely n-dimensional m-sided pancake graph mPn, which is one class of Cayley graphs and is widely used in the symmetric interconnection networks. We establish a bound of TSS on mPn by the minimum feedback vertex set.","authors":["Haining Jiang"],"meta":["June 2020Indian Journal of Pure and Applied Mathematics 51(2):379-389","DOI:10.1007/s13226-020-0406-8"],"references":["259443639_Node-to-Set_Disjoint_Paths_Problem_in_Pancake_Graphs","249862270_The_decycling_number_of_graphs","221668488_Target_Set_Selection_Problem_for_Honeycomb_Networks","221444962_An_Exact_Almost_Optimal_Algorithm_for_Target_Set_Selection_in_Social_Networks","220115857_Almost_Exact_Minimum_Feedback_Vertex_Set_in_Meshes_and_Butterflies","220114487_Fault-tolerant_routing_in_burnt_pancake_graphs","51959911_Some_Results_on_the_Target_Set_Selection_Problem","2845201_Dynamic_Monopolies_in_Tori","2477877_Maximizing_the_Spread_of_Influence_through_a_Social_Network","2429267_Feedback_Set_Problems","230540464_Decycling_Graphs","222699365_Irreversible_-threshold_processes_Graph-theoretical_threshold_models_of_the_spread_of_disease_and_of_opinion","222667658_Dynamic_Monopolies_of_Constant_Size","222134019_Local_majorities_coalitions_and_monopolies_in_graphs_A_review","221449984_On_the_Generalization_of_the_Pancake_Network","221233361_On_time_versus_size_for_monotone_dynamic_monopolies_in_regular_topologies","221133267_A_Feedback_Vertex_Set_on_Pancake_Graphs","220568906_Girth_of_pancake_graphs","220533445_On_the_Approximability_of_Influence_in_Social_Networks","220532914_Decycling_Cartesian_Products_of_Two_Cycles","220511477_Dynamic_monopolies_and_feedback_vertex_sets_in_hexagonal_grids","220151624_Combinatorial_model_and_bounds_for_target_set_selection","50292012_On_dynamic_monopolies_of_graphs_with_general_thresholds","50217895_Irreversible_k-threshold_and_majority_conversion_processes_on_completemultipartite_graphs_and_graph_products","2379126_Mining_the_Network_Value_of_Customers"]}
