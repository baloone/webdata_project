{"id":"282181759_Generalization_of_the_Truth-relevant_Semantics_to_the_Predicate_Calculus","abstract":"In 1952 P. F. Strawson proposed a logic of presuppositions. It is an\ninterpretation of Aristotelian logic, i.e. of the logic of the traditional\nsyllogism. In 1981 Richard Diaz published a monograph in which he presented\ntruth-relevant logic. This paper shows that truth-relevant logic is but a\npropositional version of the logic of presuppositions. A semantics of the logic\nof presuppositions is developed using truth-relevant logic. The semantics is\nthen further extended to polyadic logic and some consequences discussed.","authors":["Xaver Newberry"],"meta":["January 2019","SourcearXiv","Project: Feedback"],"references":["311105610_Meaning_Presuppositions_Truth-relevance_Godel's_Sentence_and_the_Liar_Paradox","282905875_The_Diagonal_Lemma_Fails_in_Aristotelian_Logic","311719708_Introduction_to_Logical_Theory","269011592_Understanding_symbolic_logic","239028838_Topics_in_the_Logic_of_Relevance"]}
