{"id":"355826936_ACDStructure_Elucidator_20_Years_in_the_History_of_Development","abstract":"The first methods associated with the Computer-Assisted Structure Elucidation (CASE) of small molecules were published over fifty years ago when spectroscopy and computer science were both in their infancy. The incredible leaps in both areas of technology could not have been envisaged at that time, but both have enabled CASE expert systems to achieve performance levels that in their present state can outperform many scientists in terms of speed to solution. The computer-assisted analysis of enormous matrices of data exemplified 1D and 2D high-resolution NMR spectroscopy datasets can easily solve what just a few years ago would have been deemed to be complex structures. While not a panacea, the application of such tools can provide support to even the most skilled spectroscopist. By this point the structures of a great number of molecular skeletons, including hundreds of complex natural products, have been elucidated using such programs. At this juncture, the expert system ACD/Structure Elucidator is likely the most advanced CASE system available and, being a commercial software product, is installed and used in many organizations. This article will provide an overview of the research and development required to pursue the lofty goals set almost two decades ago to facilitate highly automated approaches to solving complex structures from analytical spectroscopy data, using NMR as the primary data-type.","authors":["Mikhail Elyashberg","Antony John Williams"],"meta":["November 2021Molecules 26(21):6623","DOI:10.3390/molecules26216623","Project: Computer-Assisted Structure Elucidation (CASE)"],"references":["338492125_Enhancing_Computer_Assisted_Structure_Elucidation_with_DFT_analysis_of_J-couplings","336285199_NMR_Based_Computer_Assisted_Structure_Elucidation_CASE_of_Small_Organic_Molecules_in_Solution_Recent_Advances","335164951_Minimizing_the_Risk_of_Deducing_Wrong_Natural_Product_Structures_from_NMR_Data","332477537_The_role_of_computer-assisted_structure_elucidation_CASE_programs_in_the_structure_elucidation_of_complex_natural_products","322837099_The_Emergence_and_Evolution_of_Organic_Synthesis_and_Why_It_is_Important_to_Sustain_It_as_an_Advancing_Art_and_Science_for_Its_Own_Sake","319177360_Towards_unbiased_and_more_versatile_NMR-based_structure_elucidation_A_powerful_combination_of_CASE_algorithms_and_DFT_calculations","310735943_Synergistic_Combination_of_CASE_Algorithms_and_DFT_Chemical_Shift_Predictions_A_Powerful_Approach_for_Structure_Elucidation_Verification_and_Revision","286223776_Anthropic_Awareness_The_Human_Aspects_of_Scientific_Thinking_in_NMR_Spectroscopy_and_Mass_Spectrometry","283328228_X-PERT_A_User-friendly_Expert_System_for_Molecular_Structure_Elucidation_by_Spectral_Methods","281912603_Dereplication_of_natural_products_using_minimal_NMR_data_inputs","245259128_Formal-logical_method_for_interpreting_infrared_spectra_from_characteristic_frequencies","269009542_Computer-aided_generation_of_molecular_graphs","268645860_The_generation_of_molecular_graphs_with_obligatory_forbidden_and_desirable_fragments","266309691_Generation_of_molecular_graphs_with_a_given_set_of_nonoverlapping_fragments","257559280_A_new_approach_to_computer-aided_molecular_structure_elucidation_The_expert_system_Structure_Elucidator"]}
