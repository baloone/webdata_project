{"id":"228087862_ICY_an_open_bioimage_informatics_platform_for_extended_reproducible_research","abstract":"Current research in biology uses evermore complex computational and imaging tools. Here we describe Icy, a collaborative bioimage informatics platform that combines a community website for contributing and sharing tools and material, and software with a high-end visual programming framework for seamless development of sophisticated imaging workflows. Icy extends the reproducible research principles, by encouraging and facilitating the reusability, modularity, standardization and management of algorithms and protocols. Icy is free, open-source and available at http://icy.bioimageanalysis.org/.","authors":["Fabrice de Chaumont","Stephane Dallongeville","Nicolas Chenouard","Nicolas Herv√©"],"meta":["July 2012Nature Methods 9(7):690-6","DOI:10.1038/nmeth.2075","SourcePubMed","Project: Bioimage analysis"],"references":["281650581_On_the_Digital_Trail_of_Mobile_Cells","245584508_Reproducible_Research_INTRODUCTION","243127761_Prions_hijack_tunneling_nanotubes_for_intercellular_spread","228087861_BioImageXD_An_open_general-purpose_and_high-throughput_image-processing_platform","228087860_Fiji_An_Open-Source_Platform_for_Biological-Image_Analysis","224402100_Reproducible_Research_in_Signal_Processing","224360853_Guest_Editors'_Introduction_Reproducible_Research","224208247_3-D_Active_Meshes_Fast_Discrete_Deformable_Models_for_Cell_Tracking_in_3-D_Time-Lapse_Microscopy","281949248_Quantitative_four-dimensional_tracking_of_cytoplasmic_and_nuclear_HIV-1_complexes","222754953_Olivo-Marin_JC_Extraction_of_spots_in_biological_images_using_multiscale_products_Pattern_Recognit_35_1989-1996"]}
