{"id":"343215723_Existence_of_solution_and_stability_for_the_fractional_order_novel_coronavirus_nCoV-2019_model","abstract":"Abstract The aim of this work is to present a new fractional order model of novel coronavirus (nCoV-2019) under Caputo–Fabrizio derivative. We make use of fixed point theory and Picard–Lindelöf technique to explore the existence and uniqueness of solution for the proposed model. Moreover, we explore the generalized Hyers–Ulam stability of the model using Gronwall’s inequality.","authors":["Azhar Hussain","Dumitru Baleanu","Muhammad Adeel"],"meta":["July 2020Advances in Difference Equations 2020(1)","DOI:10.1186/s13662-020-02845-0","Project: Fixed Point Theory"],"references":["347992531_Modeling_the_dynamics_of_novel_coronavirus_2019-nCov_with_fractional_derivative","339568707_A_mathematical_model_for_simulating_the_phase-based_transmissibility_of_a_novel_coronavirus","332254051_Dynamics_of_Ebola_Disease_in_the_Framework_of_Different_Fractional_Derivatives","330412427_A_fractional_model_for_the_dynamics_of_tuberculosis_infection_using_Caputo-Fabrizio_derivative","328795774_A_fractional_order_pine_wilt_disease_model_with_Caputo-Fabrizio_derivative","324421295_An_Efficient_Computational_Technique_for_Fractal_Vehicular_Traffic_Flow","317558243_The_Role_of_Fractional_Time-Derivative_Operators_on_Anomalous_Diffusion","345447448_Validity_of_fractal_derivative_to_capturing_chaotic_attractors","332495044_Modeling_the_dynamics_of_hepatitis_E_via_the_Caputo-Fabrizio_derivative","331123631_New_aspects_of_fractional_Biswas-Milovic_model_with_Mittag-Leffler_law"]}
