{"id":"324756246_Automatic_JPEG_Grid_Detection_with_Controlled_False_Alarms_and_Its_Image_Forensic_Applications","abstract":"With the progress of image manipulation tools and the proliferation of fake news and images posted\nonline on social networks, automatic identification of fake content is becoming indispensable. Lossy\nimage compression leaves traces which can be used to recover the history of an image and to help\ndecide about its authenticity. We propose a new JPEG grid detection algorithm. This operation is the\nfirst step of many forensic, anti-forensic, and deblocking algorithms. Our analysis is based on the\ndetection of the blocking artifacts and is global and local at the same time. It retrieves the origin\nof the JPEG grid in all image regions and detects suspicious discrepancies. Our work is based on the\na-contrario framework which reins in the over-detections caused by multiple testing. It also\nyields a Number of False Alarms (NFA) which gives extremely secure guarantees for tampering detection.\nWe demonstrate the performance of the proposed method with both quantitative and visual results from\nwell-known image databases.","authors":["Tina Nikoukhah","Rafael Grompone von Gioi","Miguel Colom","Jean-Michel Morel"],"meta":["April 2018","DOI:10.1109/MIPR.2018.00083","Conference: 2018 IEEE Conference on Multimedia Information Processing and Retrieval (MIPR)At: Miami, USA"],"references":["321006568_An_Evaluation_of_Digital_Image_Forgery_Detection_Approaches","307524437_JPEG_Quantization_Step_Estimation_and_Its_Applications_to_Digital_Image_Forensics","279348491_LSD_A_line_segment_detector","258394548_An_Overview_on_Image_Forensics","225336502_Crop_Detection_Through_Blocking_Artefacts_Analysis","318329417_Statistical_Detection_of_JPEG_Traces_in_Digital_Images_in_Uncompressed_Formats","316314307_Detection_of_operation_chain_JPEG-Resampling-JPEG","281662521_Passive_forgery_detection_for_JPEG_compressed_image_based_on_block_size_estimation_and_consistency_analysis","259164853_Digital_image_forgery_detection_using_passive_techniques_A_survey","229789965_Digital_doctoring_How_to_tell_the_real_from_the_fake"]}
