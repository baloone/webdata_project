{"id":"336057575_Software_Engineering_Process_Models_Strengths_and_Limitations_with_SimSE","abstract":"Background/Objectives: This work mainly focuses on how game-based learning approch can improve the understanding of the software engineering courses content. Methods/Statistical Analysis: This study introduced SimSE in our software engineering course. We used it for explaining three different process models to students and we also compare these models and tried to explain the come up with a point that which model is better in a specific situation. Findings: Our results found a significant variance in the selection of the three different process model (F=6.1, 0.05), whereas, the Agile model was found to be more efficient as compare to the rest of two. Application/Improvements: A modern learning approach such as game-based learning can make more interest of students in the theoretical conceptual computer science courses such as software engineering.","authors":["Abdul Hafeez Khan","Abdul Hafeez","Syed Muhammad Hassan","Samreen Javed"],"meta":["September 2019Indian Journal of Science and Technology 12(31)","DOI:10.17485/ijst/2019/v12i31/146617,","Project: Information Technology"],"references":["228724653_Teaching_object_orientation_with_the_Blue_environment","271937664_Using_Games_and_Simulations_for_Supporting_Learning","232628471_Adapting_Game_Technology_to_Support_Software_Engineering_Process_Teaching_From_SimSE_to_MO-SEProcess","2956101_Teaching_Computer_Science_through_Game_Design"]}
