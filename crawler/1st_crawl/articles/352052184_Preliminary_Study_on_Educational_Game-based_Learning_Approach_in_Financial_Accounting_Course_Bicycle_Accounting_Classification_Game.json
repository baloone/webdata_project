The game was created to stimulate interest in learning basic financial accounting courses that are normally portrayed as a serious subject. The bicycle accounting classification game tool kit has been developed as a learning and teaching aid to enable students to collaborate and engage in the financial accounting course. The main purpose of the study is to identify the effectiveness of the tool as a mechanism to enhance students' learning motivation investigated through individual psychological needs of autonomy, competence and relatedness in a financial accounting course. The sampling was implemented to 4 accounting lecturers and one computer science lecturer in a small group tryout and 30 non accounting students in field tryout. Questionnaires were used for data collection and analyzed using quantitative methods. From the experimental results, it is discovered that the bicycle accounting classification game has contributed to the positive learning motivation, in terms of promoting their learning participation and improving their learning excitement and understanding in the financial accounting course given that knowledge organizing, and sharing is embedded in the collaborative gaming environment.","authors":["Maisarah Abd Rahim","Asyraf Afthanorhan","Nurul Fatihah Ilias","Norazzie Md Zin"],"meta":["May 2021Revista Gestão Inovação e Tecnologias 11(2 (2021)):491-509"],"references":["349866752_A_prospective_study_of_dengue_infection_in_Malaysia_A_structural_equation_modeling_approach","349663844_Another_Way_Of_Learning_Double_Entry_In_Accounting_The_Mnemonic_Approach","340508212_Intrinsic_and_extrinsic_motivation_from_a_self-determination_theory_perspective_Definitions_theory_practices_and_future_directions","339483274_Examining_learning_engagement_in_MOOCs_a_self-determination_theoretical_perspective_using_mixed_method","338872583_Understanding_Physical_Activity_Intentions_in_Physical_Education_Context_A_Multi-Level_Analysis_from_the_Self-Determination_Theory","338520281_Towards_a_motivational_design_Connecting_gamification_user_types_and_online_learning_activities","336201238_Interactive_Gamification_Learning_Media_Application_For_Blind_Children_Using_Android_Smartphone_in_Indonesia","332423790_Cooperative_Entrepreneurship_in_Malaysian_Secondary_Schools_A_Review_of_Current_Practices","339588836_Students'_Motivation_Level_in_Gamification_of_Accounting_Teaching_and_Learning_-_A_Case_of_'Accounting_on_the_Block'","332433225_A_Qualitative_Study_on_Memory_Aid_Kit_MAK_in_Enhancing_Students'_Comprehension_of_Accounting_Theories","325528964_Online_Learning_Readiness_and_Attitudes_Towards_Gaming_in_Gamified_Online_Learning_-_A_Mixed_Methods_Case_Study","320695296_A_review_of_intrinsic_motivation_elements_in_gamified_online_learning","320234774_GAMIFICATION_IN_EDUCATION","318317590_The_effect_of_games_and_simulations_on_higher_education_a_systematic_literature_review","325672098_The_Contributions_of_Color_to_Recognition_Memory_for_Natural_Scenes"]}
