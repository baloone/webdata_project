{"id":"285935551_Principles_of_Corrosion_Engineering_and_Corrosion_Control","abstract":"Corrosion is a huge issue for materials, mechanical, civil and petrochemical engineers. With comprehensive coverage of the principles of corrosion engineering, this book is a one-stop text and reference for students and practicing corrosion engineers. Highly illustrated, with worked examples and definitions, it covers basic corrosion principles, and more advanced information for postgraduate students and professionals. Basic principles of electrochemistry and chemical thermodynamics are incorporated to make the book accessible for students and engineers who do not have prior knowledge of this area. Each form of corrosion covered in the book has a definition, description, mechanism, examples and preventative methods. Case histories of failure are cited for each form. End of chapter questions are accompanied by an online solutions manual. * Comprehensively covers the principles of corrosion engineering, methods of corrosion protection and corrosion processes and control in selected engineering environments * Structured for corrosion science and engineering classes at senior undergraduate and graduate level, and is an ideal reference that readers will want to use in their professional work * Worked examples, extensive end of chapter exercises and accompanying online solutions and written by an expert from a key pretochemical university.","authors":["Zaki Ahmad"],"meta":["January 2006","DOI:10.1016/B978-0-7506-5924-6.X5000-4"],"references":["323458488_Formation_and_shape_of_pits_on_iron_under_corrosive_attacks_and_theoretical_considerations_of_pitting_corrosion_Entstehung_und_Bestalt_von_Korrosionsloechern_bei_Lochfrass_an_Eisen_und_theoretische_Fo","322063532_Carbide_sensitization_and_intergranular_corrosion_of_nickel_base_alloys","316333035_Effect_of_Alloying_Elements_on_the_Vanadium_Pentoxide_Attack_of_20Cr-10Ni_Type_Heat_Resisting_Steels","296809849_Putting_the_pressure_on_for_improved_steel_forming","295598736_Steel_-_Vision_for_the_future","294485614_Don't_let_those_boiler_tubes_fail_again_Part_2_How_to_identify_common_economizer_inlet_header_failure_mechanisms","294241973_Corrosion_inhibitors_for_crude_distillation_columns","292118599_Mechanism_of_Intergranular_Corrosion_in_Ferritic_Stainless_Steels","291997139_Computer_aided_materials_selection_for_mechanical_design","289578971_Effect_of_Alloy_Composition_on_Stress_Corrosion_Cracking_of_Fe-Cr-Ni_Base_Alloys","285606952_Morphology_of_grain_boundary_carbides_and_its_influence_on_intergranular_corrosion_of_304_stainless_steel","285496023_Concrete_repairs","284594972_Corrosion","284594908_Effect_of_Composition_on_Stress_Corrosion_Cracking_of_Some_Alloys_Containing_Nickel","284587944_Application_of_scanning_reference_electrode_technique_to_study_steel_corrosion_in_cement_based_coatings","284578630_Chloride_extraction_and_re-alkalization_of_concrete","284470126_Survey_of_structures_by_using_acoustic_emission_monitoring","284392794_Electrochemical_potential_monitoring_on_reinforced_concrete_structure_using_anodic_pulse_technique","284392632_The_use_of_potential_wheel_to_survey_reinforced_concrete_structures","279705272_Study_of_the_corrosion_of_concrete_reinforcement_by_electrochemical_impedance_measurement","279539395_Potential_mapping_and_corrosion_of_steel_in_concrete","275596018_Die_Kinetik_der_Entstehung_und_des_Wachstums_von_Lochfrassstellen_auf_passiven_Eisenelektroden","274675795_Role_of_Stress_in_the_Stress_Corrosion_Cracking_of_a_Mg-Al_Alloy","272309439_Use_of_Potentiokinetic_and_Potentiostatic_Methods_for_the_Determination_of_Characteristic_Potentials_for_Pitting_Corrosion_of_an_Fe-Cr_Alloy","269665438_The_Petch-Stables_Theory_of_Hydrogen_Embrittlement","269664602_Intergranular_Corrosion_in_High_Purity_Ferritic_Stainless_Steels_Effect_of_Cooling_Rate_and_Alloy_Composition","255025073_Battling_boiler_corrosion","249844190_Atmospheric_corrosion_of_zinc_Part_1_Rural_and_urban_atmospheres","248230889_The_science_of_durability_of_organic_coatings_a_foreword","248206368_Electron_microscope_investigation_of_the_intergranular_corrosion_fracture_surfaces_in_a_sensitized_austenitic_stainless_steel","248205600_Deutung_der_interkristallinen_Korrosion_von_nichtrostenden_Stahlen_im_Zusammenhang_mit_der_Chrom-Verarmungstheorie","244675387_Oxide_Growth_on_Copper_and_Alpha-Brasses_in_Aqueous_Ammonia","244674248_On_the_Initiation_and_Growth_of_Stress_Corrosion_Cracks_in_Tarnished_Brass","234933785_Galvanic_Potentials_of_Grains_and_Grain_Boundaries_in_Copper_Alloys","234866558_A_Point_Defect_Model_for_Anodic_Passive_Films_I_Film_Growth_Kinetics","233545432_Stress_Corrosion_Spectrum","233523060_Corrosion_phenomena_in_coastal_area_of_Arabian_Gulf","230273880_The_influence_of_sodium_chloride_on_the_atmospheric_corrosion_of_steel","229656730_Breakdown_of_passivity_and_localized_corrosion_Theoretical_concepts_and_fundamental_experimental_results","229354431_On_a_surface_energy_mechanism_for_stress-corrosion_cracking","223796401_The_stress_corrosion_cracking_mechanism_of_a-titanium_alloys_at_room_temperature"]}
