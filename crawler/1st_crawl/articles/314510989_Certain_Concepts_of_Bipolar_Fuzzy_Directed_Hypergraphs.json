{"id":"314510989_Certain_Concepts_of_Bipolar_Fuzzy_Directed_Hypergraphs","abstract":"A hypergraph is the most developed tool for modeling various practical problems in different fields, including computer sciences, biological sciences, social networks and psychology. Sometimes, given data in a network model are based on bipolar information rather than one sided. To deal with such types of problems, we use mathematical models that are based on bipolar fuzzy (BF) sets. In this research paper, we introduce the concept of BF directed hypergraphs. We describe certain operations on BF directed hypergraphs, including addition, multiplication, vertex-wise multiplication and structural subtraction. We introduce the concept of B = ( m + , m âˆ’ ) -tempered BF directed hypergraphs and investigate some of their properties. We also present an algorithm to compute the minimum arc length of a BF directed hyperpath.","authors":["Muhammad Akram","Anam Luqman"],"meta":["March 2017","DOI:10.3390/math5010017"],"references":["313660198_Intuitionistic_fuzzy_hypergraphs","276358501_Mixed_H-Infinity_and_Passive_Filtering_for_Discrete_Fuzzy_Neural_Networks_With_Stochastic_Jumps_and_Time_Delays","309162310_Novel_applications_of_bipolar_fuzzy_graphs_to_decision_making_problems","303889488_Novel_concepts_of_bipolar_fuzzy_competition_graphs","302558561_Graphs_and_Hypergraphs","285264036_Fuzzy_Graphs_Fuzzy_Sets_and_their_Applications","283157319_Bipolar_fuzzy_graphs","282965561_Dissipativity-Based_Filtering_for_Fuzzy_Switched_Systems_With_Stochastic_Perturbation","276100671_Bipolar-valued_rough_fuzzy_set_and_its_applications_to_decision_information_system","271621524_Certain_types_of_intuitionistic_fuzzy_directed_hypergraphs"]}
