The aim of this paper is to present the results of a study in which second year students from the Educational Science department were engaged in an interactive lecture, which consisted of designing and implementing a teaching activity. All in all, we want to bring into discussion the importance of creating, among students, a sense of ownership over their own learning.","authors":["Elena Marin"],"meta":["May 2015Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences 180:854-859","DOI:10.1016/j.sbspro.2015.02.224"],"references":["256115753_The_Handbook_of_Experiential_Learning_Management_Education"]}
