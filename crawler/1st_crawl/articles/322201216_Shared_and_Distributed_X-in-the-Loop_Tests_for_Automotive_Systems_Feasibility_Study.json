{"id":"322201216_Shared_and_Distributed_X-in-the-Loop_Tests_for_Automotive_Systems_Feasibility_Study","abstract":"X-in-the-loop (XIL) technologies are receiving increased attention in modern automotive development processes. In particular, collaborative experiments, such as XIL tools, have efficient applications in the design of multi-actuated, electric, and automated vehicles. The presented paper introduces results of such a collaborative study for XIL, which focused on the feasibility of coordinated real-time (RT) simulations for the control of vehicle dynamics systems. The outcomes are based on extensive co-simulation tests performed using remote connections among different geographical locations; the connections were between Germany, on one side and USA, South Africa, and The Netherlands, from the other side. The performed study allowed formulating requirements for further shared and distributed XIL-experiments for functional validation of automotive control systems.
