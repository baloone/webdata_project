{"id":"345497534_Discovering_spurious_links_in_multiplex_networks_based_on_interlayer_relevance","abstract":"Many real-world complex systems can be better modelled as multiplex networks, where the same individuals develop connections in multiple layers. Examples include social networks between individuals on multiple social networking platforms, and transportation networks between cities based on air, rail and road networks. Accurately predicting spurious links in multiplex networks is a challenging issue. In this article, we show that one can effectively use interlayer information to build an algorithm for spurious link prediction. We propose a similarity index that combines intralayer similarity with interlayer relevance for the link prediction purpose. The proposed similarity index is used to rank the node pairs, and identify those that are likely to be spurious. Our experimental results show that the proposed metric is much more accurate than intralayer similarity measures in correctly predicting the spurious links. The proposed method is an unsupervised method and has low computation complexity, and thus can be effectively applied for spurious link prediction in large-scale networks.","authors":["Zeynab Samei","Mahdi Jalili"],"meta":["October 2019","DOI:10.1093/comnet/cnz007"],"references":["313494864_Link_prediction_in_multiplex_online_social_networks","281514970_An_information-theoretic_model_for_link_prediction_in_complex_networks","281427488_A_Multilayer_Approach_to_Multiplexity_and_Link_Prediction_in_Online_Geo-Social_Networks","276656204_Link_prediction_in_multiplex_networks","265852714_Multiplexity_versus_correlation_The_role_of_local_constraints_in_real_multiplexes","262071553_MuxViz_A_Tool_for_Multilayer_Analysis_and_Visualization_of_Networks","261732150_Structural_measures_for_multiplex_networks","260605715_Measuring_and_modeling_correlations_in_multiplex_networks","257142871_Multilayer_Networks","255972432_Growing_Multiplex_Networks","249317333_Statistical_mechanics_of_multiplex_networks_Entropy_and_overlap","235750273_Emergence_of_network_features_from_multiplexity","224964550_Removing_spurious_interactions_in_complex_networks","220485509_Link_prediction_in_complex_networks_A_local_naive_Bayes_model","51937401_Finding_missing_edges_in_networks_based_on_their_community_structure","45275132_Multirelational_Organization_of_Large-Scale_Social_Networks_in_an_Online_World","38081952_Similarity_index_based_on_local_paths_for_link_prediction_of_complex_networks","11369888_Comparative_Assessment_of_Large-scale_Data_Sets_of_Protein-Protein_Interactions","9067381_Preferential_Attachment_in_the_Protein_Network_Evolution","8130434_Scale-free_trees_The_skeletons_of_complex_networks","7241975_Wiring_optimization_can_relate_neuronal_structure_and_function","5400581_Networks_Teasing_out_the_missing_links","3297672_Random-Walk_Computation_of_Similarities_between_Nodes_of_a_Graph_with_Application_to_Collaborative_Recommendation","344526821_The_Collegial_Phenomenon","320695357_Information_cascades_in_complex_networks","318550023_Link_prediction_via_layer_relevance_of_multiplex_networks","292679977_Prediction_of_missing_links_based_on_community_relevance_and_ruler_inference","272359268_Towards_real-world_complexity_an_introduction_to_multiplex_networks","268817412_The_Structure_and_Dynamics_of_Multilayer_Networks","263202279_Identifying_missing_and_spurious_connections_via_the_bi-directional_diffusion_on_bipartite_networks","253644652_Combinatorial_Analysis_of_Multiple_Networks","235361598_The_Diffusion_of_an_Innovation_Among_Physicians","227588355_Predicting_Missing_Links_via_Local_Information","225501301_A_New_Status_Index_Derived_From_Sociometric_Analysis","222712643_Complex_networks_Structure_and_dynamics","222673166_Network_inference_error_and_informant_inaccuracy_A_Bayesian_approach","222401825_Friends_and_Neighbors_on_the_Web","220520125_Prediction_and_ranking_algorithms_for_event-based_network_data","51949966_Correlated_multiplexity_and_connectivity_of_multiplex_random_networks","45626635_Link_Prediction_Based_on_Local_Random_Walk","40696069_Missing_and_spurious_interactions_and_the_reconstruction_of_complex_networks","30496197_New_Specifications_for_Exponential_Random_Graph_Models","26720965_Information_filtering_based_on_transferring_similarity","7175372_Vertex_similarity_in_networks","5400591_Hierarchical_structure_and_the_prediction_of_missing_links_in_networks","2930322_The_Link_Prediction_Problem_for_Social_Networks"]}
