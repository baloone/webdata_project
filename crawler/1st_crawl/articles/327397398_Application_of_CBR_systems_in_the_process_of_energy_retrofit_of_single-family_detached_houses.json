{"id":"327397398_Application_of_CBR_systems_in_the_process_of_energy_retrofit_of_single-family_detached_houses","abstract":"In Poland, there are more than 5 million single-family detached houses, and 35% among them are non-insulated. In the article, we present a concept of application of the case-based reasoning (CBR) systems to support the process of energy retrofit of single-family detached houses. In the proposed CBR system, the energy retrofit process was described using parameters with text and numeric values and also using linguistic variables defined using fuzzy sets. If an investor, designer or contractor encounters a problem in the process of the energy retrofit, he may look for a solution to this problem or similar problems in the CBR system. If he does not find a solution and creates it himself or modifies an existing one, he should put it in the CBR system so that others can benefit from his experience. The proposed CBR system will help in solving the basic Polish (but also Eastern European) problem of energy-saving constructions which is the lack of adequate knowledge of participants in the investment process.","authors":["Arkadiusz Węglarz","Paweł Grzegorz Gilewski"],"meta":["January 2018MATEC Web of Conferences 196(2-B):02033","DOI:10.1051/matecconf/201819602033"],"references":["318665302_Advantages_of_pre-fabricated_reinforced_concrete_construction_in_Iraq","318656291_Interdisciplinary_diagnostics_in_the_process_of_revitalization_of_historic_buildings_in_terms_of_changing_their_function","306544481_A_Method_of_Evaluation_of_Polioptimal_Thermo-modernization_Schemes_of_Buildings","290242803_Active_Control_Of_Smart_Tensegrity_Structures","345682756_Single-Family_Residential_Building_Energy_Retrofit_A_Case_Study","324059641_Analysis_of_the_impact_of_simulation_model_simplifications_on_the_quality_of_low-energy_buildings_simulation_results","265788289_On_possible_applications_of_smart_structures_controlled_by_self-stress"]}
