{"id":"241617171_Reflection_and_Refraction_of_Mechanical_Waves_at_Solid-Liquid_Boundaries_II","abstract":"The energy ratios of reflected and refracted waves at various solid-liquid boundaries are calculated as a function of the angle of incidence in the solid. The influence of density and wave velocities on the general shape of the resulting curves is discussed.","authors":["Walter G.
