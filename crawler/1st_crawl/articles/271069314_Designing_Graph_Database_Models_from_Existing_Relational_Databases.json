{"id":"271069314_Designing_Graph_Database_Models_from_Existing_Relational_Databases","abstract":"n this paper, a method for transforming a relational database to a graph database model is described. In this approach, the dependency graphs for the entities in the system are transformed into star graphs. This star graph model is transformed into a hyper graph model for the relational database, which, in turn, can be used to develop the domain relationship model that can be converted in to a graph database model.","authors":["Subhrajyoti Bordoloi","Bichitra Kalita"],"meta":["July 2013International Journal of Computer Applications 74(1):25-31","DOI:10.5120/12850-9303"],"references":["332012041_APPLICATIONS_OF_GRAPH_THEORY_IN_COMPUTER_SCIENCE_AN_OVERVIEW","265276331_COMPARING_MANUAL_AND_AUTOMATIC_NORMALIZATION_TECHNIQUES_FOR_RELATIONAL_DATABASE","231226012_Graph_Database_Model_for_Querying_Searching_and_Updating","220538546_Graph_Data_Management_Systems_for_New_Application_Domains","220432198_Degrees_of_Acyclicity_for_Hypergraphs_and_Relational_Database_Schemes","241624301_Emails_as_graph_Relation_discovery_in_email_archive","222298880_Converting_relational_database_into_XML_documents_with_DOM","220688512_An_Introduction_to_Database_Systems_2nd_Edition","44556543_An_introduction_to_database_systems_C_J_Date"]}
