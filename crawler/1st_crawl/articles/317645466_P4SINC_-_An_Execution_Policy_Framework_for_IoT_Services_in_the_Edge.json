{"id":"317645466_P4SINC_-_An_Execution_Policy_Framework_for_IoT_Services_in_the_Edge","abstract":"Internet of Things (IoT) services are increasingly\ndeployed at the edge to access and control Things. The execution\nof such services needs to be monitored to provide information\nfor security, service contract, and system operation management.\nAlthough different techniques have been proposed for deploying\nand executing IoT services in IoT gateways and edge servers,\nthere is a lack of generic policy frameworks for instrumentation\nand assurance of various types of execution policies for IoT\nservices. In this paper, we present P4SINC as an execution policy\nframework that covers various functionalities for IoT services\ndeployed in software-defined machines in IoT infrastructures.\nP4SINC supports the instrumentation and enforcement of IoT\nservices during their deployment and execution, thus being\nleveraged for other purposes such as security and service contract\nmanagement. We illustrate our prototype with realistic examples.","authors":["Phu H.
