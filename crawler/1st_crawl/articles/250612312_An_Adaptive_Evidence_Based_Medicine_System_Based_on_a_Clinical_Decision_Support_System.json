{"id":"250612312_An_Adaptive_Evidence_Based_Medicine_System_Based_on_a_Clinical_Decision_Support_System","abstract":"Clinical decision support system provides healthcare personnel with the right information, in the right format, to the right person, at the right place, and at the right time. The goals of this system are to eliminate errors, reduce unjustified practice variation and wasteful commitment of resources, and encourage best practices and accountability in medicine. In this paper, we propose a dynamic and integrated framework for evidence based medicine system. Our framework depends on a knowledge base contained in the clinical practice guidelines. These guidelines are discovered from randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, expert knowledge and knowledge extracted continuously from Electronic Health Record (EHR) using data mining techniques. This proposed framework will facilitate the online guidance to physicians when making clinical decisions.","authors":["Samir El-Masri","Shaker El-Sappagh","Alaa el-din mohamed Riad","Mohammed Elmogy"],"meta":["November 2012"],"references":["312653110_Comparing_computer-interpretable_guideline_models_a_case-study_approach","222895704_Sharable_Representation_of_Clinical_Guidelines_in_GLIF_Relationship_to_the_Arden_Syntax","51962845_Data_Mining_and_Electronic_Health_Records_Selecting_Optimal_ClinicalTreatments_in_Practice","51368470_The_SAGE_guideline_modeling_Motivation_and_methodology","247269750_PROfarma_A_method_and_language_for_specifying_clinical_guidelines_and_protocols","51195818_Clinical_data_interoperability_based_on_archetype_transformation","51093814_Data_Mining_in_Healthcare_and_Biomedicine_A_Survey_of_the_Literature","41943167_Challenges_in_using_evidence_to_inform_your_clinical_practice_in_low_back_pain","23309723_Evidence_Based_Medicine_and_Shared_Decision_Making_The_Challenge_of_Getting_Both_Evidence_and_Preferences_into_Health_Care","13506176_The_Asgaard_Project_A_Task-Specific_Framework_for_the_Application_and_Critiquing_of_Time-Oriented_Clinical_Guidelines"]}
