{"id":"222181140_The_correspondence_between_partial_metrics_and_semivaluations","abstract":"Partial metrics, or the equivalent weightable quasi-metrics, have been introduced in Matthews (Proc. 8th Summer Conf. on General Topology and Applications; Ann. New York Acad. Sci. 728 (1994) 183) as part of the study of the denotational semantics of data flow networks (Theoret. Comput. Sci. 151 (1995) 195). The interest in valuations in connection to Domain Theory derives from e.g. Jones and Plotkin (LICS ’89, IEEE Computer Society Press, Silver Spring, MD, 1998, pp. 186-195), Jones (Ph.D. Thesis, University of Edinburgh, 1989), Edalat (LICS’94, IEEE Computer Society Press, Silver Spring, MD, 1994) and Heckmann (Fund. Inform. 24(3) (1995) 259). Connections between partial metrics and valuations have been discussed in the literature, e.g. O'Neill (in: S. Andima et al. (Eds.), Proc. 11th Summer Conf. on General Topology and Applications; Ann. New York Acad. Sci. 806 (1997) 304), Bukatin and Scott (in: S. Adian, A. Nerode (Eds.), Logical Foundations of Computer Science, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Vol. 1234, Springer, Berlin, 1997, pp. 33-43) and Bukatin and Shorina (in: M. Nivat (Ed.), Foundations of Software Science and Computation Structures, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Vol. 1378, Springer, Berlin, 1998, pp. 125-139). In each case, partial metrics are generated from strictly increasing valuations.","authors":["Michel Schellekens"],"meta":["May 2004Theoretical Computer Science 315(1):135-149","DOI:10.1016/j.tcs.2003.11.016","Sourcedx.doi.org"],"references":["242793128_The_Smyth_Completion","221443275_Semantics_of_Exact_Real_Arithmetic","2845934_Duality_and_Quasi-Normability_for_Complexity_Spaces","277281464_Lattice_Theory","277065078_Probabilistic_Non-Determinism","268041138_Uniform_lattices_II_Order_continuity_and_exhaustivity","268018700_Quasi-Uniform_Spaces","266829381_Uniform_lattices_I_A_generalization_of_topological_Riesz_spaces_and_topological_Boolean_rings","265568165_Completeness_of_Quasi-Uniform_and_Syntopological_Spaces","262348269_Totally_bounded_spaces_and_compact_ordered_spaces_as_domains_of_computation","244441651_Semantics_of_Programming_Languages_Programming_Techniques","243767060_Algebraic_Theory_of_Lattices","243765773_Valuations_on_continuous_lattices","239031108_A_Compendium_of_Continuous_Lattices","230595875_Lattice_Theory","228766529_Spaces_of_Valuations","227974229_Weighted_Quasi-Metrics","227656324_Partial_Metric_Topology","227183993_C-complete_quasi-uniform_spaces","226476593_On_the_semantics_of_logic_programming_languages","226299199_Uniform_lattices","223052592_The_Smyth_Completion_A_Common_Foundation_for_Denotational_Semantics_and_Complexity_Analysis","221570108_Partial_Metrics_and_Co-continuous_Valuations","220909733_Quasi_Uniformities_Reconciling_Domains_with_Metric_Spaces","220909721_The_Asymmetric_Topology_of_Computer_Science","220800051_Towards_Computing_Distances_Between_Programs_via_Scott_Domains","220690085_Computability_and_complexity_-_from_a_programming_perspective","220154993_An_Extensional_Treatment_of_Lazy_Data_Flow_Deadlock","220148511_Generalized_Metric_Spaces_Completion_Topology_and_Powerdomains_via_the_Yoneda_Embedding","3561058_Domain_Theory_and_Integration","3501211_Probabilistic_powerdomain_of_evaluations","2862740_On_Upper_Weightable_Spaces","2860758_Complexity_Spaces_Lifting_Directedness","2853596_Quasi-metric_Properties_of_Complexity_Spaces","2785856_The_Semantics_of_Types_in_Programming_Languages","2513449_Approximation_of_Metric_Spaces_by_Partial_Metric_Spaces","2451475_Lower_Bag_Domains"]}
