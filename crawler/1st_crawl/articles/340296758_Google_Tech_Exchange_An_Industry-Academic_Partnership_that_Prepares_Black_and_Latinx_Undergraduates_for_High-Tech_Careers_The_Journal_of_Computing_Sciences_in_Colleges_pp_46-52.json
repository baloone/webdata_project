Tech Exchangeâ€™s mission is to unlock opportunities in the tech industry for Black and Latinx undergraduates. It is an immersive computer science experience for students and faculty.Participants spend a semester or two at Google in Silicon Valley taking or co-teaching computer science courses, including cutting-edge ones not offered at many universities. The 2018-2019 graduates especially valued the community-building, and a high percentage secured technical internships or jobs.","authors":["A. Alvarez","Legand Burge","S. Emanuel","S.
