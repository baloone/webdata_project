{"id":"220298324_Selective_Revision","abstract":"We introduce a constructive model of selective belief revision in which it is possible to accept only a part of the input information. A selective revision operator ο is defined by the equality K ο α = K * f(α), where * is an AGM revision operator and f a function, typically with the property ⊢ α → f(α). Axiomatic characterizations are provided for three variants of selective revision.","authors":["Eduardo Fermé","Sven Ove Hansson"],"meta":["November 1999Studia Logica 63(3):331-342","DOI:10.1023/A:1005294718935","SourceDBLP"],"references":["220316041_On_the_Logic_of_Theory_Change_Partial_Meet_Contraction_and_Revision_Functions","243677126_A_Textbook_of_Belief_Dynamics","239060822_Hierarchies_of_Regulations_and_Their_Logic","232492592_Knowledge_in_Flux_Modeling_the_Dynamic_of_Epistemic_States","229775614_On_the_Logic_of_Small_Changes_in_Hypertheories","229757541_On_the_Logic_of_Theory_Change_Contraction_Functions_And_Their_Associated_Revision_Functions"]}
