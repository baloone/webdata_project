{"id":"309046229_Why_Can't_I_Learn_Programming_The_Learning_and_Teaching_Environment_of_Programming","abstract":"This article focuses on teaching a textual programming language as the first programming language (allowing for previously studied visual programming languages). The teaching process is placed into a real educational environment in connection with the national curriculum, social expectations and students reactions. In order to write a program, several abilities and pieces of knowledge are required. There are tools and syllabuses for teaching these skills but the result mainly depends on the personality of the students and teachers. We use the term “Learning Activity Unit” to describe the teaching–learning process of programming and detecting gaps in every day practice. This very simple model is practical for teachers to detect problems. In the global view of teaching programming, the implementation of the curriculum could be analysed.","authors":["Zsuzsanna Szalayné Tahy","Zoltán Czirkos"],"meta":["October 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-46747-4_17","Conference: International Conference on Informatics in Schools: Situation, Evolution, and Perspectives"],"references":["300253780_Computing_at_School_in_Sweden_-_Experiences_from_Introducing_Computer_Science_within_Existing_Subjects","300253595_Introducing_a_New_Computer_Science_Curriculum_for_All_School_Levels_in_Poland","235925815_Methods_of_teaching_programming"]}
