{"id":"335148187_CUT_ELIMINATION_IN_HYPERSEQUENT_CALCULUS_FOR_SOME_LOGICS_OF_LINEAR_TIME","abstract":"This is a sequel article to [10] where a hypersequent calculus (HC) for some temporal logics of linear frames including Kt4.3 and its extensions for dense and serial flow of time was investigated in detail. A distinctive feature of this approach is that hypersequents are noncommutative, i.e., they are finite lists of sequents in contrast to other hypersequent approaches using sets or multisets. Such a system in [10] was proved to be cut-free HC formalization of respective logics by means of semantical argument. In this article we present an equivalent variant of this calculus for which a constructive syntactical proof of cut elimination is provided.","authors":["ANDRZEJ INDRZEJCZAK"],"meta":["August 2019The Review of Symbolic Logic 12(4):1-20","DOI:10.1017/S1755020319000352"],"references":["280561781_Linear_Nested_Sequents_2-Sequents_and_Hypersequents","271855773_Grafting_Hypersequents_onto_Nested_Sequents","266990431_Axioms_vs_Hypersequent_Rules_with_Context_Restrictions_Theory_and_Applications","222407917_Algebraic_and_proof-theoretic_characterizations_of_truth_stressers_for_MTL_and_its_extensions","321512356_Grundlehren_der_mathematischen_Wissenschaften","312657216_Uniform_cut-free_formulations_of_T_S4_and_S5_abstract","299501457_Linear_time_in_hypersequent_framework","290706642_Hypersequent_Calculi_for_Modal_Logics_Extending_S4","281305624_Hypersequent_Calculi_for_S5_The_Methods_of_Cut_Elimination","279409948_Hypersequent_Calculi_for_Godel_Logics_--_a_Survey","267146388_Cut-free_hypersequent_calculus_FOR_S43","265351891_Proof_Theory_for_Fuzzy_Logics","263857057_Eliminability_of_cut_in_hypersequent_calculi_for_some_modal_logics_of_linear_frames","261157291_From_Frame_Properties_to_Hypersequent_Rules_in_Modal_Logics","243786654_Some_Calculi_of_Modal_Logic","220642875_Hypersequents_logical_consequence_and_intermediate_logics_for_concurrency","220316287_A_Constructive_Analysis_of_RM"]}
