{"id":"262451912_On_the_Efficiency_of_Solving_Boolean_Polynomial_Systems_with_the_Characteristic_Set_Method","abstract":"An improved characteristic set algorithm for solving Boolean polynomial\nsystems is proposed. This algorithm is based on the idea of converting all the\npolynomials into monic ones by zero decomposition, and using additions to\nobtain pseudo-remainders. To improve the efficiency, two important techniques\nare applied in the algorithm. One is eliminating variables by new generated\nlinear polynomials, and the other is optimizing the order of choosing\npolynomial for zero decomposition. We present some complexity bounds of the\nalgorithm by analyzing the structure of the zero decomposition tree. Some\nexperimental results show that this new algorithm is more efficient than\nprecious characteristic set algorithms for solving Boolean polynomial systems,\nand in some cases the running time of this algorithm can be well predicted by\nanalyzing a part of branches in the zero decomposition tree.","authors":["Zhenyu Huang","Yao Sun","Dongdai Lin"],"meta":["November 2019Journal of Symbolic Computation","DOI:10.1016/j.jsc.2019.11.001","SourcearXiv"],"references":["326908713_PBCS_An_Efficient_Parallel_Characteristic_Set_Method_for_Solving_Boolean_Polynomial_Systems","312173033_Solving_Polynomial_Systems_with_Noise_over_F_2_Revisited","291282065_A_New_Method_for_Solving_Polynomial_Systems_with_Noise_over_mathbbF_2_and_Its_Applications_in_Cold_Boot_Key_Recovery","283897001_On_implementing_the_symbolic_preprocessing_function_over_Boolean_polynomial_rings_in_Grobner_basis_algorithms_using_linear_algebra","260021509_A_New_Method_for_Solving_Polynomial_Systems_with_Noise_over_F2_and_Its_Applications_in_Cold_Boot_Key_Recovery","285022936_Basic_principles_of_mechanical_theorem_proving_in_elementary_geometries","280765005_Graph-based_algorithms_for_Boolean_function_manipulation","271738395_Differential_cryptanalysis_of_PRESENT-like_cipher","268069576_Logical_foundations_of_proof_complexity_Reprint_of_the_2010_hardback_ed","267682051_An_Algebraic_Cryptanalysis_of_Nonlinear_Filter_Generators_using_Grobner_bases"]}
