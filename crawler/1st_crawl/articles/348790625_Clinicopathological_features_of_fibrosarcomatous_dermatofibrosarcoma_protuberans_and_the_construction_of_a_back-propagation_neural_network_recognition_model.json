Few studies have compared the clinicopathological features of FS-DFSP and conventional DFSP (C-DFSP).\n\nObjectives\nTo better understand the epidemiological and clinicopathological characteristics of FS-DFSP.\n\nMethods\nWe conducted a cohort study of 221 patients diagnosed with DFSP and built a recognition model with a back-propagation (BP) neural network for FS-DFSP.\n\nResults\nTwenty-six patients with FS-DFSP and 195 patients with C-DFSP were included. There were no differences between FS-DFSP and C-DFSP regarding age at presentation, age at diagnosis, sex, size at diagnosis, size at presentation, and tumor growth. The negative ratio of CD34 in FS-DFSP (11.5%) was significantly lower than that in C-DFSP (5.1%) ( P = 0.005). The average Ki-67 index of FS-DFSP (18.1%) cases was significantly higher than that of C-DFSP (8.1%) cases ( P < 0.001). The classification accuracy of the BP neural network model training samples was 100%. The correct rates of classification and misdiagnosis were 84.1% and 15.9%.\n\nConclusions\nThe clinical manifestations of FS-DFSP and C-DFSP are similar but have large differences in immunohistochemistry. The classification accuracy and feasibility of the BP neural network model are high in FS-DFSP.","authors":["Yanan Li","Jiaqi Liang","Xuewen Xu","Xian Jiang"],"meta":["January 2021Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 16(48):1-9","DOI:10.1186/s13023-021-01698-4","Project: Pediatric solid tumors"],"references":["338750480_Compressive_Strength_Prediction_of_PVA_Fiber-_Reinforced_Cementitious_Composites_Containing_Nano-SiO2_Using_BP_Neural_Network","338405391_Channel_Prediction_Based_on_BP_Neural_Network_for_Backscatter_Communication_Networks","336181108_Dermatofibrosarcoma_Protuberans","336028536_Clinical_features_of_dermatofibrosarcoma_protuberans_and_risk_factors_for_local_recurrence_after_Mohs_micrographic_surgery","335215686_Ultrasonic_Characterization_of_Thermal_Barrier_Coatings_Porosity_through_BP_Neural_Network_Optimizing_Gaussian_Process_Regression_Algorithm","331890987_Current_treatment_options_in_dermatofibrosarcoma_protuberans","330401940_Outcome_after_surgical_treatment_of_dermatofibrosarcoma_protuberans_DFSP_Is_clinical_follow-up_always_indicated","325346224_Dermatofibrosarcoma_protuberans_A_clinical_analysis","325292420_Dermatofibrosarcoma_Protuberans_A_Retrospective_Study_of_Clinicopathological_Features_and_Related_AktmTOR_STAT3_ERK_Cyclin_D1_and_PD-L1_Expression","321263417_Survival_in_patients_with_primary_Dermatofibrosarcoma_Protuberans_National_Cancer_Data_Base_analysis"]}
