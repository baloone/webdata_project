{"id":"280062066_Simple_Causes_of_Complexity_in_Hedonic_Games","abstract":"Hedonic games provide a natural model of coalition formation among\nself-interested agents. The associated problem of finding stable outcomes in\nsuch games has been extensively studied. In this paper, we identify simple\nconditions on expressivity of hedonic games that are sufficient for the problem\nof checking whether a given game admits a stable outcome to be computationally\nhard. Somewhat surprisingly, these conditions are very mild and intuitive. Our\nresults apply to a wide range of stability concepts (core stability, individual\nstability, Nash stability, etc.) and to many known formalisms for hedonic games\n(additively separable games, games with W-preferences, fractional hedonic\ngames, etc.), and unify and extend known results for these formalisms. They\nalso have broader applicability: for several classes of hedonic games whose\ncomputational complexity has not been explored in prior work, we show that our\nframework immediately implies a number of hardness results for them.","authors":["Dominik Peters","Edith Elkind"],"meta":["July 2015","SourcearXiv"],"references":["221659297_Existence_of_Stability_in_Hedonic_Coalition_Formation_Games"]}
