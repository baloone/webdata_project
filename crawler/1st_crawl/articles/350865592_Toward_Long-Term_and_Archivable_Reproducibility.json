{"id":"350865592_Toward_Long-Term_and_Archivable_Reproducibility","abstract":"Analysis pipelines commonly use high-level technologies that are popular when created, but are unlikely to be readable, executable, or sustainable in the long term. A set of criteria is introduced to address this problem: Completeness (no execution requirement beyond a minimal Unix-like operating system, no administrator privileges, no network connection, and storage primarily in plain text); modular design; minimal complexity; scalability; verifiable inputs and outputs; version control; linking analysis with narrative; and free software. As a proof of concept, we introduce \"Maneage\" (Managing data lineage), enabling cheap archiving, provenance extraction, and peer verification that been tested in several research publications. We show that longevity is a realistic requirement that does not sacrifice immediate or short-term reproducibility. The caveats (with proposed solutions) are then discussed and we conclude with the benefits for the various stakeholders. This paper is itself written with Maneage (project commit eeff5de).","authors":["Mohammad Akhlaghi","Raul Infante-Sainz","Boudewijn F.
