{"id":"315902014_Interventions_in_higher_education_and_their_effect_on_student_success_a_meta-analysis","abstract":"This article provides a meta-analysis on the effect of academic probation, student-faculty mentoring and need-based grants on various student outcomes. Using 25 (quasi-) experimental studies, we find that academic probation has a significant negative effect on retention (d = âˆ’.17), while it does not have an effect on graduation. Student-faculty mentoring, however, has a positive significant effect on both retention (d = .15) and graduation (d = .10). Need-based grants are proven to have a positive significant effect on enrollment (d = .05), retention (d = .05) and graduation (d = .05). Based on the general effect sizes of each intervention, student-faculty mentoring has the largest influence on student outcomes. The latter intervention improves retention and graduation of the treatment group by, respectively, 8% and 5% compared to the control group.","authors":["Eline Sneyers","Kristof De Witte"],"meta":["March 2017Educational Review 70(6):1-21","DOI:10.1080/00131911.2017.1300874","Project: efficiency and effectiveness in higher education"],"references":["312658661_Big_data_and_the_measurement_of_public_organizations'_performance_and_efficiency_The_state-of-the-art","331236300_Systematic_Reviews_in_Education_Research_When_Do_Effect_Studies_Provide_Evidence","323371958_Academic_probation_student_performance_and_strategic_course-taking","311554083_The_first_year_in_higher_education-critical_requirements_from_the_student_perspective","305166663_Dropout_from_Higher_Education_A_Theoretical_Synthesis_of_Recent_Research","284006727_The_effects_of_high-quality_student_mentoring","278118414_Does_Aid_Matter_Measuring_the_Effect_of_Student_Aid_on_College_Attendance_and_Completion","277629891_Need-Based_Aid_and_College_Persistence","275922097_The_Effects_of_Student_Coaching_An_Evaluation_of_a_Randomized_Experiment_in_Student_Advising","275829469_Increasing_Persistence_Research-Based_Strategies_for_College_Student_Success"]}
