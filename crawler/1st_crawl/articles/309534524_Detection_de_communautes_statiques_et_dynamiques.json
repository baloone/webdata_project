{"id":"309534524_Detection_de_communautes_statiques_et_dynamiques","abstract":"The discovery of cohesive groups, cliques and communities within a network is one of the most studied topics in social network analysis. It attracted many researchers in sociology, biology, computer science, physics, criminology, etc. However, most of the studies in this area have focused on static networks while leaving aside the dynamic networks and even more those temporal. However, in these cases, issues such as evolution, the structure change and sometimes even behind the formation of these communities are interesting issues to address. Given the proliferation of social networks from the spatio-temporal data, we have to point out that the study of dynamic communities becomes a paramount challenge the since they are sometimes volatile and/or mutable. The objective of this article is to reviewing studies on communities detection. Afterwards, we highlight the limits of most communities detection approaches in order to point out how we can deal with them.","authors":["Ahmed Ould Mohamed Moctar","Idrissa Sarr"],"meta":["October 2016Revue D Intelligence Artificielle 30(4):469-496","DOI:10.3166/ria.30.469-496"],"references":["266679653_Detection_de_communautes_dynamiques_dans_des_reseaux_temporels","264124767_Community_detection_in_large-scale_networks_A_survey_and_empirical_evaluation","261355115_Review_based_on_data_clustering_algorithms","256188948_Virality_Prediction_and_Community_Structure_in_Social_Networks","284048429_Detecting_communities_in_large_networks","281675121_A_Survey_on_Community_Detection_Methods_in_Social_Networks","278645372_Exploratory_link_stream_analysis_for_event_detection","274448476_A_Method_for_the_Analysis_of_the_Structure_of_Complex_Organizations","265415290_Uncovering_the_overlapping_community_structure_of_complex_networks_by_maximal_cliques","254040275_CDBIA_A_dynamic_community_detection_method_based_on_incremental_analysis"]}
