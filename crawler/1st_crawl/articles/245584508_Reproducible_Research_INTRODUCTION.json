From Euclid's reasoning and Galileo's experiments , it took hundreds of years for the theoretical and experimental branches of science to develop standards for publication and peer review. Computational science, rightly regarded as the third branch, can walk the same road much faster.","authors":["Sergey Fomel","Jon F.
