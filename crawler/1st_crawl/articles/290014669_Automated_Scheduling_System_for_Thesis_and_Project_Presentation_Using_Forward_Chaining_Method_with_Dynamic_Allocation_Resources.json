{"id":"290014669_Automated_Scheduling_System_for_Thesis_and_Project_Presentation_Using_Forward_Chaining_Method_with_Dynamic_Allocation_Resources","abstract":"This paper presents a practical method for modeling and solving a dynamic resource allocation of automatic scheduling problem using forward chaining heuristic approach, in the case of undergraduate Student's Thesis and Project presentations timetable. Poor scheduling practices would cause double-assignations of lecturers, prolonged postponement and cancellations of presentations as well as inefficient use of time and resources. This method will follow a pre-assigned logic rules and algorithm to fit the optimization criteria's. The output of this research will be an automatic set of presentation schedule alternatives that will take into account all the constraints. The proposed algorithm for this automatic scheduling system could generate optimal presentation timetable and enables direct interaction with lecturers in order to gather data of their availability time among other its functionalities. The proposed system performs satisfactorily in term of accuracy, data handling and adaptability on helping the faculty to arrange presentations more easily, yield a reliable record and increase efficient use of resources.","authors":["Cut Fiarni","Arief Samuel Gunawan","Ricky","Herastia Maharani"],"meta":["December 2015Procedia Computer Science 72:209-216","DOI:10.1016/j.procs.2015.12.133"],"references":["222549395_A_graph-based_hyper-heuristic_for_educational_timetabling_problems","255533193_An_approach_for_the_ClassTeacher_Timetabling_Problem_using_Graph_Coloring","222957725_Applying_evolutionary_computation_to_the_school_timetabling_problem_The_Greek_case","221559062_Recent_Developments_in_Practical_Course_Timetabling"]}
