{"id":"290263937_Supervised_multiview_learning_based_on_simultaneous_learning_of_multiview_intact_and_single_view_classifier","abstract":"Multiview learning problem refers to the problem of learning a classifier\nfrom multiple view data. In this data set, each data points is presented by\nmultiple different views. In this paper, we propose a novel method for this\nproblem. This method is based on two assumptions. The first assumption is that\neach data point has an intact feature vector, and each view is obtained by a\nlinear transformation from the intact vector. The second assumption is that the\nintact vectors are discriminative, and in the intact space, we have a linear\nclassifier to separate the positive class from the negative class. We define an\nintact vector for each data point, and a view-conditional transformation matrix\nfor each view, and propose to reconstruct the multiple view feature vectors by\nthe product of the corresponding intact vectors and transformation matrices.\nMoreover, we also propose a linear classifier in the intact space, and learn it\njointly with the intact vectors. The learning problem is modeled by a\nminimization problem, and the objective function is composed of a Cauchy error\nestimator-based view-conditional reconstruction term over all data points and\nviews, and a classification error term measured by hinge loss over all the\nintact vectors of all the data points. Some regularization terms are also\nimposed to different variables in the objective function. The minimization\nproblem is solve by an iterative algorithm using alternate optimization\nstrategy and gradient descent algorithm. The proposed algorithm shows it\nadvantage in the compression to other multiview learning algorithms on\nbenchmark data sets.","authors":["Qingjun Wang","Haiyan Lv","Jun Yue","Eugene Mitchell"],"meta":["August 2017Neural Computing and Applications 28(8)","DOI:10.1007/s00521-016-2189-8","SourcearXiv"],"references":["304292849_Multiple_Kernel_Multivariate_Performance_Learning_Using_Cutting_Plane_Algorithm","294121440_Convex_multi-task_relationship_learning_using_hinge_loss","289161957_Multi-view_supervised_latent_dirichlet_allocation","286824364_Scholarly_big_data_information_extraction_and_integration_in_the_CiteSeerch_digital_library","282279972_Road_Traffic_Congestion_Monitoring_in_Social_Media_with_Hinge-Loss_Markov_Random_Fields","281312689_Multiple_kernel_multivariate_performance_learning_using_cutting_plane_algorithm","281145227_Supervised_learning_of_sparse_context_reconstruction_coefficients_for_data_representation_and_classification","281145045_Image_Tag_Completion_by_Local_Learning","281135555_Feature_Subset_Selection_Using_Naive_Bayes_for_Text_Classification","280970501_A_Comment_on_A_Similarity_Measure_for_Text_Classification_and_Clustering","280123664_Automatic_classification_of_diseases_from_free-text_death_certificates_for_real-time_surveillance","278737488_Challenges_in_Content-Based_Image_Indexing_of_Cultural_Heritage_Collections","277963100_Modeling_Nanoparticle_Targeting_to_a_Vascular_Surface_in_Shear_Flow_Through_Diffusive_Particle_Dynamics","280970057_Manifold_regularization_in_structured_output_space_for_semi-supervised_structured_output_prediction","279633337_Representing_Data_by_Sparse_Combination_of_Contextual_Data_Points_for_Classification"]}
