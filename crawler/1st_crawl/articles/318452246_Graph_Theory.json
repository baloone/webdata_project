{"id":"318452246_Graph_Theory","abstract":"This standard textbook of modern graph theory, now in its fifth edition, combines the authority of a classic with the engaging freshness of style that is the hallmark of active mathematics. It covers the core material of the subject with concise yet reliably complete proofs, while offering glimpses of more advanced methods in each field by one or two deeper results, again with proofs given in full detail.\nThe book can be used as a reliable text for an introductory course, as a graduate text, and for self-study.\nFrom the reviews:\n“This outstanding book cannot be substituted with any other book on the present textbook market. It has every chance of becoming the standard textbook for graph theory.”Acta Scientiarum Mathematiciarum\n“Deep, clear, wonderful. This is a serious book about the heart of graph theory. It has depth and integrity. ”Persi Diaconis & Ron Graham, SIAM Review\n“The book has received a very enthusiastic reception, which it amply deserves. A masterly elucidation of modern graph theory.” Bulletin of the Institute of Combinatorics and its Applications\n“Succeeds dramatically ... a hell of a good book.” MAA Reviews\n“A highlight of the book is what is by far the best account in print of the Seymour-Robertson theory of graph minors.” Mathematika\n“ ... like listening to someone explain mathematics.” Bulletin of the AMS","authors":["Reinhard Diestel"],"meta":["January 2017","DOI:10.1007/978-3-662-53622-3","ISBN: 978-3-662-53621-6"],"references":[]}
