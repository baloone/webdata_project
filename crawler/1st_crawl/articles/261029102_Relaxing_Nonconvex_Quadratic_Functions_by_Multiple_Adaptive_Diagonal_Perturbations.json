{"id":"261029102_Relaxing_Nonconvex_Quadratic_Functions_by_Multiple_Adaptive_Diagonal_Perturbations","abstract":"The current bottleneck of globally solving mixed-integer (non-convex)\nquadratically constrained problem (MIQCP) is still to construct strong but\ncomputationally cheap convex relaxations, especially when dense quadratic\nfunctions are present. We propose a cutting surface procedure based on multiple\ndiagonal perturbations to derive strong convex quadratic relaxations for\nnonconvex quadratic problem with separable constraints. Our resulting\nrelaxation does not use significantly more variables than the original problem,\nin contrast to many other relaxations based on lifting. The corresponding\nseparation problem is a highly structured semidefinite program (SDP) with\nconvex but non-smooth objective. We propose to solve this separation problem\nwith a specialized primal-barrier coordinate minimization algorithm.\nComputational results show that our approach is very promising. First, our\nseparation algorithm is at least an order of magnitude faster than interior\npoint methods for SDPs on problems up to a few hundred variables. Secondly, on\nnonconvex quadratic integer problems, our cutting surface procedure provides\nlower bounds of almost the same strength with the diagonal SDP bounds used by\n(Buchheim and Wiegele, 2013) in their branch-and-bound code Q-MIST, while our\nprocedure is at least an order of magnitude faster on problems with dimension\ngreater than 70. Finally, combined with (linear) projected RLT cutting planes\nproposed by (Saxena, Bonami and Lee, 2011), our procedure provides slightly\nweaker bounds than their projected SDP+RLT cutting surface procedure, but in\nseveral order of magnitude shorter time. Finally we discuss various avenues to\nextend our work to design more efficient branch-and-bound algorithms for\nMIQCPs.","authors":["Hongbo Dong"],"meta":["March 2014SIAM Journal on Optimization 26(3)","DOI:10.1137/140960657","SourcearXiv"],"references":["281445632_On_global_optimization_with_indefinite_quadratics","268414035_couenne_a_user's_manual","257605373_A_Generalization_of_the_Classical_BB_Convex_Underestimation_via_Diagonal_and_Nondiagonal_Quadratic_Terms","228919786_Semidefinite_relaxations_for_non-convex_quadratic_mixed-integer_programming","228441940_Globally_solving_nonconvex_quadratic_programming_problems_via_completely_positive_programming","226536623_Solving_a_Class_of_Semidefinite_Programs_via_Nonlinear_Programming","220589642_Solving_Max-Cut_to_optimality_by_intersecting_semidefinite_and_polyhedral_relaxations","301362113_On_the_Implementation_of_an_Interior-Point_Filter_Line-Search_Algorithm_for_Large-Scale_Nonlinear_Programming","266522502_Improving_the_Performance_of_MIQP_Solvers_for_Quadratic_Programs_with_Cardinality_and_Minimum_Threshold_Constraints_A_Semidefinite_Program_Approach","258985389_Yalmip_A_toolbox_for_modeling_and_optimization_in_MATLAB","257479942_SpeeDP_An_algorithm_to_compute_SDP_bounds_for_very_large_Max-Cut_instances","242369675_Global_Optimization_of_Mixed-Integer_Nonlinear_Programs","225251506_Convex_relaxations_of_non-convex_mixed_integer_quadratically_constrained_programs_Projected_formulations","222153918_Improving_the_performance_of_standard_solvers_for_quadratic_0-1_programs_by_a_tight_convex_reformulation_The_QCR_method","220589561_Perspective_reformulations_of_mixed_integer_nonlinear_programs_with_indicator_variables","220589348_A_branch-and-cut_algorithm_for_nonconvex_quadratic_programs_with_box_constraints","220249550_Semidefinite_programming_versus_the_reformulation-linearization_technique_for_nonconvex_quadratically_constrained_quadratic_programming","220060297_SDP_diagonalizations_and_perspective_cuts_for_a_class_of_nonseparable_MIQP"]}
