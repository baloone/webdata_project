{"id":"330859848_A_comparative_evaluation_of_hybrid_error_correction_methods_for_error-prone_long_reads","abstract":"Background\nThird-generation sequencing technologies have advanced the progress of the biological research by generating reads that are substantially longer than second-generation sequencing technologies. However, their notorious high error rate impedes straightforward data analysis and limits their application. A handful of error correction methods for these error-prone long reads have been developed to date. The output data quality is very important for downstream analysis, whereas computing resources could limit the utility of some computing-intense tools. There is a lack of standardized assessments for these long-read error-correction methods.\n\nResults\nHere, we present a comparative performance assessment of ten state-of-the-art error-correction methods for long reads. We established a common set of benchmarks for performance assessment, including sensitivity, accuracy, output rate, alignment rate, output read length, run time, and memory usage, as well as the effects of error correction on two downstream applications of long reads: de novo assembly and resolving haplotype sequences.\n\nConclusions\nTaking into account all of these metrics, we provide a suggestive guideline for method choice based on available data size, computing resources, and individual research goals.\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (10.1186/s13059-018-1605-z) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.","authors":["Shuhua Fu","Anqi Wang","Kin Fai Au"],"meta":["February 2019Genome Biology 20(1)","DOI:10.1186/s13059-018-1605-z"],"references":["344854848_Error_correction_and_assembly_complexity_of_single_molecule_sequencing_reads","323089321_FMLRC_Hybrid_long_read_error_correction_using_an_FM-index","322990845_High_contiguity_Arabidopsis_thaliana_genome_assembly_with_a_single_nanopore_flow_cell","322779298_Nanopore_sequencing_and_assembly_of_a_human_genome_with_ultra-long_reads","322640187_Multi-Platform_Sequencing_Approach_Reveals_a_Novel_Transcriptome_Profile_in_Pseudorabies_Virus","322600954_Complete_genomic_and_transcriptional_landscape_analysis_using_third-generation_sequencing_A_case_study_of_Saccharomyces_cerevisiae_CENPK113-7D","322016094_MinION-based_long-read_sequencing_and_assembly_extends_the_Caenorhabditis_elegans_reference_genome","323107391_Highly_sensitive_detection_of_mutations_in_CHO_cell_recombinant_DNA_using_multi-parallel_single_molecule_real-time_DNA_sequencing_Highly_sensitive_detection_of_mutations","321891405_Efficiency_of_PacBio_long_read_correction_by_2nd_generation_Illumina_sequencing","321282459_Single_molecule_real-time_SMRT_R_DNA_sequencing_of_HLA_genes_at_ultra-high_resolution_from_126_International_HLA_and_Immunogenetics_Workshop_cell_lines","320915777_Nanopore_sequencing_of_complex_genomic_rearrangements_in_yeast_reveals_mechanisms_of_repeat-mediated_double-strand_break_repair","317837822_De_novo_yeast_genome_assemblies_from_MinION_PacBio_and_MiSeq_platforms","317683794_Comprehensive_comparison_of_Pacific_Biosciences_and_Oxford_Nanopore_Technologies_and_their_applications_to_transcriptome_analysis","317077598_A_survey_of_the_complex_transcriptome_from_the_highly_polyploid_sugarcane_genome_using_full-length_isoform_sequencing_and_de_novo_assembly_from_short_read_sequencing","316971484_Long-read_sequencing_uncovers_the_adaptive_topography_of_a_carnivorous_plant_genome"]}
