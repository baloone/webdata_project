{"id":"316578932_Generation_of_3D_polycrystalline_microstructures_with_a_conditioned_Laguerre-Voronoi_tessellation_technique","abstract":"Voronoi tessellation techniques are widely accepted methods for the generation of representative models of polycrystalline microstructures of metallurgic and ceramic materials. Contrary to most of the Voronoi-based tessellation methods developed, the Laguerre Voronoi technique provides control over the size and shape of the cells, therefore allowing to simulate accurately the grain structure of a wide range of materials. This paper presents a method for the generation of numerical models of 3D polycrystalline microstructures, based on the Laguerre-Voronoi tessellation technique. An innovative approach to define the additional parameters required by the Laguerre-Voronoi formulation for the generation of realistic 3D microstructures is presented, providing the algorithm with information on the given microstructure from a set of 2D micrographs easily obtainable experimentally. The method implemented efficiently avoids degenerated cells (affecting the quality of the final structure) and finds the most representative set of input values by comparing 2D sections of the numerical model against 2D imaging of real polished surfaces. In this paper, the capability of the method developed is verified by reproducing the microstructure of polycrystalline alumina with various ranges of grain sizes, deriving from different sintering procedures.","authors":["Simone Falco","Jiawei Jiang","F.
