{"id":"317769245_Using_a_combined_approach_AHP_PROMETHEE_to_make_a_decision_about_roads_alternative_project_A_case_study","abstract":"The FESIA-framework environmental and social impact assessment have become a necessity in the past years in several countries. The linear projects, especially the roads, are expanding and have become a priority for the development of the country. The technical studies, typically offer several alternatives, and it come back to decision-makers to choose the variant which responds better to their need. Overall, just the technical-economic criteria that allow you to decide the choice. However, the environmental component is become important, and should be taken into account in the overall decision. In our case study, we tried to apply a combined approach AHP-PROMETHEE that is a MCDA Method to be able to choose between three alternatives of bypass road of the Marrakech city in Morocco. Thirteen Sub criteria have been selected, which are of different natures (qualitative and quantitative), and which have been grouped into four main groups of criteria MC (physical, bioecological, socio-economic, project).The main criteria and sub criteria have been compared by pairs in order to determine their weights, then we have calculated the preference index φ+(a) and φ-(a) of each alternative, in order to be able to calculate the net preference index φ(a).The results concluded, have allowed to choose an alternative that present a higher value of φ(a), which means that it is the alternative which respects better, the preference adopted.","authors":["A.
