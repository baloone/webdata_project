{"id":"295856613_Modeling_Temporal_Effectiveness_for_Context-Aware_Web_Services_Recommendation","abstract":"Context-Aware Recommender System (CARS) aims\nto not only recommend services similar to those already rated\nwith the highest score, but also provide opportunities for\nexploring the important role of temporal, spatial and social\ncontexts for personalized web services recommendation. A key\nstep for temporal-based CARS methods is to explore the time\ndecay process of past invocation records to make the Quality of\nServices (QoS) prediction. However, it is a nontrivial task to\nmodel the temporal effects on web services recommendation,\ndue to the dynamic features of contextual information in view\nof temporal spatial correlations. For instance, in locationaware\nservices recommendation, the userâ€™s geographical\nposition would change very frequently as time goes on. In this\npaper, we propose a Context-Aware Services Recommendation\nbased on Temporal Effectiveness (CASR-TE) method. Inspired\nby existing time decay approaches, we first present an\nenhanced temporal decay model combining the time decay\nfunction with traditional similarity measurement methods.\nThen, we model temporal spatial correlations as well as their\nimpacts on the user preference expansion. Finally, we evaluate\nthe CASR-TE method on WS-Dream dataset by evaluation\nmatrices of both RMSE and MAE. Experimental results show\nthat our approach outperforms several benchmark methods\nwith a significant margin.","authors":["Xiaoliang Fan","Yakun Hu","Ruisheng Zhang","Wenbo Chen"],"meta":["June 2015","DOI:10.1109/ICWS.2015.39","Conference: 22th IEEE Conference on Web Services (ICWS 2015 Research Track)At: New York, USA"],"references":["295856772_Context-Aware_Web_Services_Recommendation_Based_on_User_Preference","322445232_What_we_talk_about_when_we_talk_about_populism","301412876_Incorporating_Invocation_Time_in_Predicting_Web_Service_QoS_via_Triadic_Factorization","289772085_An_improved_time-effectiveness_reliability_prediction_approach_of_web_service","289352147_Time-Aware_Service_Recommendation_for_Mashup_Creation_in_an_Evolving_Service_Ecosystem","288319123_Location-Based_Hierarchical_Matrix_Factorization_for_Web_Service_Recommendation","287396486_Web_Service_Recommendation_Based_on_Watchlist_via_Temporal_and_Tag_Preference_Fusion","286679992_A_Time-Aware_and_Data_Sparsity_Tolerant_Approach_for_Web_Service_Recommendation","268237379_Spatio-Temporal_Topic_Modeling_in_Mobile_Social_Media_for_Location_Recommendation","266654400_Modeling_temporal_effects_of_human_mobile_behavior_on_location-based_social_networks"]}
