{"id":"261404786_Exponential_convergence_to_quasi-stationary_distribution_and_Q_Q_-process","abstract":"For general, almost surely absorbed Markov processes, we obtain necessary and\nsufficient conditions for exponential convergence to a unique quasi-stationary\ndistribution in the total variation norm. These conditions also ensure the\nexistence and exponential ergodicity of the $Q$-process (the process\nconditioned to never be absorbed). We apply these results to one-dimensional\nbirth and death processes with catastrophes, multi-dimensional birth and death\nprocesses, infinite-dimensional population models with Brownian mutations and\nneutron transport dynamics absorbed at the boundary of a bounded domain.","authors":["Nicolas Champagnat","Denis Villemonais"],"meta":["April 2014Probability Theory and Related Fields 164(1)","DOI:10.1007/s00440-014-0611-7","SourcearXiv"],"references":["301837020_Exponential_convergence_to_quasi-stationary_distribution_for_multi-dimensional_diffusion_processes","286163548_Existence_and_Uniqueness_of_a_Quasistationary_Distribution_for_Markov_Processes_with_Fast_Return_from_Infinity","268689616_Hastings-Metropolis_algorithm_on_Markov_chains_for_small-probability_estimation","268648174_Quasi-Stationary_Distributions_and_Convergence_to_Quasi-Stationarity_of_Birth-Death_Processes","328076608_Mean_Field_Simulation_for_Monte_Carlo_Integration","305979088_On_quasi-stationary_distributions_in_absorbing_continuous-time_finite_Markov_chains","301868535_Quasi-stationary_distributions_for_structured_birth_and_death_processes_with_mutations","284789215_Certain_limit_theorems_of_the_theory_of_branching_random_processes","274365019_Diffusions_Markov_Processes_and_Martingales_Vol_1_Foundations","268317054_Handbook_of_Brownian_Motion-Facts_and_Formulae"]}
