{"id":"343345875_THEOLOGICAL_AI_Its_Scope_and_Aspect","abstract":"AI's interaction with humans is a great impact on sustaining the Fourth Industrial Revolution. To think like a human, a machine has to be rational like human. To be a rational like humans, AI needs to develop its logic. In computer science, it is said to be 'logical reasoning'. The more logical reasoning AI can be, the closer it will be to humans. The relationship between humans and religions (theologies) has begun since the beginning of the creation of human beings. If AI wants to be rational like humans, then it is important to know about theology. Theology is the systematic study of religion, spiritual, and religious beliefs more widely. It's the test of faith. If AI have familiar with someone's religious views, then it will be closer to act or think or solve problems like humans.","authors":["Sajib Hasan"],"meta":["July 2020","Project: Theological Artificial Intelligence"],"references":["283925025_Maintaining_Knowledge_about_Temporal_Intervals"]}
