{"id":"317826860_Behavioural_Intention_and_Pre-Service_Mathematics_Teachers'_Technological_Pedagogical_Content_Knowledge","abstract":"Teachers' beliefs, together with sound technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK), are directly related to the effective integration of technology in mathematics teaching. This study explored the relationship between pre-service teachers' behavioural intention to use technology to teach mathematics and their TPACK. A case-study analysis was conducted to determine whether six pre-service teachers' behavioural intention to use technology in their classroom delivery was associated with a predominance of TPACK (the TPACK model component) in their choice of technology-supported mathematical tasks. The findings showed a considerable disconnect between pre-service teachers' behavioural intention and their technological pedagogical content knowledge. Even where they expressed favourable intentions, the type of knowledge they called into play when selecting technology-supported tasks was unrelated to TPACK and did not suffice to identify the educational potential of technology. An emphasis on TPACK, in conjunction with the development of favourable attitudes toward the use of technology, is therefore believed to be indispensable in pre-service teacher education programmes.","authors":["Ignacio Gonz√°lez-Ruiz","Maria Jose Gonzalez"],"meta":["March 2017Eurasia Journal of Mathematics, Science and Technology Education 13(3):601-620","DOI:10.12973/eurasia.2017.00635a"],"references":["290044779_A_Review_of_Technological_Pedagogical_Content_Knowledge","283845835_An_Investigation_of_Preservice_Teachers'_Technological_Pedagogical_Content_Knowledge_Based_on_a_Variety_of_Characteristics","283473344_Teacher_beliefs_toward_using_alternative_teaching_approaches_in_science_and_mathematics_classes_related_to_experience_in_teaching","279851535_Teaching_Practices_in_Primary_and_Secondary_Schools_in_Europe_Insights_from_Large-scale_Assessments_in_Education","304534338_Understanding_Attitudes_and_Predicting_Social_Behavior","290797049_Examining_Current_Beliefs_Practices_and_Barriers_About_Technology_Integration_A_Case_Study","286656148_How_do_we_measure_TPACK_Let_me_count_the_ways","286613364_Influential_factors_on_preservice_teachers'_intentions_to_use_ICT_in_future_lessons","284776091_The_validation_of_an_instrument_measuring_TPACK","283844374_Pre-service_Teachers'_Developing_Technological_Pedagogical_Content_Knowledge_TPACK_and_Beliefs_on_the_Use_of_Technology_in_the_K-12_Mathematics_Classroom_A_Review_of_the_Literature"]}
