{"id":"333072628_Mammogram_Image_Enhancement_Using_Entropy_and_CLAHE_Based_Intuitionistic_Fuzzy_Method","abstract":"Mortality rate because of breast cancer\ndiminishes to a large extent if the categorization of breast\nlesions as malignant or benign is done properly. But this\nprocess is quite complicated owing to erroneous detection of\nnoise pixels as false positives. It can be reduced by proper\nenhancement of the features of the mammogram giving an\nindication of cancer. In this paper, contrast limited adaptive\nhistogram equalization (CLAHE) and entropy-based\nintuitionistic fuzzy method is proposed for enhancing the\ncontrast of digital mammogram images. To validate the\nefficacy of the proposed algorithm over type II fuzzy set-based\ntechniques, subjective, quantitative and visual evaluation is\ndone on publicly available MIAS database. Experimental\nresults prove that the proposed technique gives better visual\nquality. It provides high values of subjective and quantitative\nmetrics compared to several states of art algorithms.\n\nKeywordsâ€”CLAHE (contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram\nEqualization); Entropy; Fuzzy Image Processing; Image\nEnhancement; Intuitionistic Fuzzy Set; Mammogram.","authors":["Jyoti Dabass","Shaveta Arora","Rekha Vig","Madasu Hanmandlu"],"meta":["March 2019","DOI:10.1109/SPIN.2019.8711696","Conference: 2019 6th International Conference on Signal Processing and Integrated Networks (SPIN)"],"references":["323313031_Local_entropy_maximization_based_image_fusion_for_contrast_enhancement_of_mammogram","276153180_Divergence_Measures_for_Intuitionistic_Fuzzy_Sets","276122936_Fuzzy_Rule_Based_Enhancement_in_the_SMRT_Domain_for_Low_Contrast_Images","41509534_Intuitionistic_Fuzzy_Segmentation_of_Medical_Images","333089135_Applications_of_Advanced_Fuzzy_Set_in_Medical_Image_Analysis_A_Review","333089129_Segmentation_Techniques_for_Breast_Cancer_Imaging_Modalities-_A_Review","331802882_Applications_of_Type_II_Fuzzy_Sets-A_Mathematical_Review_on_Breast_Cancer_Imaging_Modalities","329917215_Comparative_Analysis_of_Noise_Filtering_Techniques_for_Medical_Images_in_Fuzzy_Domai","324434187_An_Efficient_Technique_for_Medical_Image_Enhancement_Based_on_Interval_Type-2_Fuzzy_Set_Logic","323611512_Biomedical_Image_Enhancement_Using_Different_Techniques_-_A_Comparative_Study","323611149_Effectiveness_of_Region_Growing_Based_Segmentation_Technique_for_Various_Medical_Images_-_A_Study","317652654_Uncertain_Rule-Based_Fuzzy_Systems","309657653_Mammogram_Enhancement_Using_Intuitionistic_Fuzzy_Sets","309457075_Intuitionistic_fuzzy_sets","292971943_Contrast_enhancement_and_brightness_preserving_of_digital_mammograms_using_fuzzy_clipped_contrast_-_limited_adaptive_histogram_equalization_algorithm","283756586_Image_enhancement_using_smoothing_with_fuzzy_sets","283726594_Entropy_for_intuitionistic_fuzzy_sets","267272421_A_Novel_Evolutionary_Kernel_Intuitionistic_Fuzzy_C_-means_Clustering_Algorithm","265946072_Intuitionistic_fuzzy_measures_Theory_and_applications","265852991_Segmentation_of_gray_scale_image_based_on_intuitionistic_fuzzy_sets_constructed_from_several_membership_functions","265520144_An_improved_medical_image_enhancement_scheme_using_Type_II_fuzzy_set","265166948_Medical_Image_Processing_Advanced_Fuzzy_Set_Theoretic_Techniques","247934441_Intuitionistic_Fuzzy_Image_Processing","224381465_A-IFS_Histon_Based_Multithresholding_Algorithm_for_Color_Image_Segmentation","222441629_Adaptive_Histogram_Equalization_and_Its_Variations","26856085_Can_Computer-aided_Detection_Be_Detrimental_to_Mammographic_Interpretation","3396450_Image_enhancement_using_fuzzy_set"]}
