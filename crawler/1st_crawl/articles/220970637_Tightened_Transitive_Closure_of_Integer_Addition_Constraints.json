{"id":"220970637_Tightened_Transitive_Closure_of_Integer_Addition_Constraints","abstract":"We present algorithms for testing the satisfiability and find- ing the tightened transitive closure of conjunctions of addi- tion constraints of the form x y d and bound con- straints of the form x d where x and y are integer vari- ables and d is an integer constrant. The running time of these algorithms is a cubic polynomial in the number of input con- straints. We also describe an efficient matrix representation of addition and bound constraints. The matrix representation provides a easy, algebraic implementation of the satisfiability and tightened transitive closure algorithms. We also outline the use of these algorithms for the improved implementation of abstract interpretation methods based on the octagonal ab- stract domain.","authors":["Peter Revesz"],"meta":["January 2009","SourceDBLP","Conference: Eighth Symposium on Abstraction, Reformulation, and Approximation, SARA 2009, Lake Arrowhead, California, USA, 8-10 August 2009"],"references":["220997507_Abstract_Interpretation_A_Unified_Lattice_Model_for_Static_Analysis_of_Programs_by_Construction_or_Approximation_of_Fixpoints","302282301_Symbolic_Model_Checking","262272871_Model_Checking","256744909_Constraint_Query_Languages","238686682_A_closed_form_for_datalog_queries_with_integer_gap-order_constraints","222259483_Revesz_PZ_A_Closed-Form_Evaluation_for_Datalog_Queries_with_Integer_Gap-Order_Constraints_Theoretical_Computer_Science_1161-2_117-149","221551011_The_Constraint_Database_Approach_to_Software_Verification","221310501_Processing_Conjunctive_Predicates_and_Queries","221215003_The_MLPQGIS_constraint_database_system","220970631_Verifying_the_Incorrectness_of_Programs_and_Automata"]}
