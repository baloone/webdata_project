We developed a highly efficient realistic AF model reflecting the patient endocardial voltage and local conduction and tested its clinical feasibility. We acquired > 500 endocardial bipolar electrograms during right atrial pacing at the beginning of the AF ablation procedures. Based on the clinical bipolar electrograms, we generated simulated voltage maps by applying fibrosis and local activation maps adjusted for the fiber orientation. The software’s accuracy (CUVIA2.5) was retrospectively tested in 17 patients and feasibility prospectively in 10 during clinical AF ablation. Results: We found excellent correlations between the clinical and simulated voltage maps (R = 0.933, p < 0.001) and clinical and virtual local conduction (R = 0.958, p < 0.001). The proportion of virtual local fibrosis was 15.4, 22.2, and 36.9% in the paroxysmal AF, persistent AF, and post-pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) states, respectively. The reconstructed virtual bipolar electrogram exhibited a relatively good similarities of morphology to the local clinical bipolar electrogram (R = 0.60 ± 0.08, p < 0.001). Feasibility testing revealed an in situ procedural computing time from the clinical data acquisition to wave-dynamics analyses of 48.2 ± 4.9 min. All virtual analyses were successfully achieved during clinical PVI procedures. We developed a highly efficient, realistic, in situ procedural simulation model reflective of individual anatomy, fiber orientation, fibrosis, and electrophysiology that can be applied during AF ablation.","authors":["Byounghyun Lim","Jaehyeok Kim","Minki Hwang","Jun-Seop Song"],"meta":["February 2020Scientific Reports 10(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-020-59372-x"],"references":["332892483_Multiple_factors_influence_the_morphology_of_the_bipolar_electrogram_An_in_silico_modeling_study","329197330_Patient-specific_simulations_predict_efficacy_of_ablation_of_interatrial_connections_for_treatment_of_persistent_atrial_fibrillation","327552131_Wavelength_and_Fibrosis_Affect_Phase_Singularity_Locations_During_Atrial_Fibrillation","327403870_Personalized_virtual-heart_technology_for_guiding_the_ablation_of_infarct-related_ventricular_tachycardia","322864086_Catheter_Ablation_for_Atrial_Fibrillation_with_Heart_Failure","322142823_Effectiveness_of_atrial_fibrillation_rotor_ablation_is_dependent_on_conduction_velocity_An_in-silico_3-dimensional_modeling_study","320868840_Influence_of_the_earliest_right_atrial_activation_site_and_its_proximity_to_interatrial_connections_on_P-wave_morphology","323136111_Stroke_and_Cardiovascular_Events_After_Ablation_or_Antiarrhythmic_Drugs_for_Treatment_of_Patients_With_Atrial_Fibrillation","321631605_Personalized_Imaging_and_Modeling_Strategies_for_Arrhythmia_Prevention_and_Therapy","321054590_Atrial_Substrate_and_Triggers_of_Paroxysmal_Atrial_Fibrillation_in_Patients_With_Obstructive_Sleep_Apnea"]}
