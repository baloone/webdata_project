However, for a novice researcher or one who is unfamiliar with this technique, understanding and applying this method has proved to be difficult. Therefore, this study was undertaken with the purpose of clarifying important concepts and aspects of this method as well as discussing its core points. The content analysis method was systematized during the first half of the twentieth century and, at first, it was an important tool for analyzing articles and advertisements published by the media in the United States.
