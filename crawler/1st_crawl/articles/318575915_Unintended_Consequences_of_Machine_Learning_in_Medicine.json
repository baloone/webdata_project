{"id":"318575915_Unintended_Consequences_of_Machine_Learning_in_Medicine","abstract":"Over the past decade, machine learning techniques have made substantial advances in many domains. In health care, global interest in the potential of machine learning has increased; for example, a deep learning algorithm has shown high accuracy in detecting diabetic retinopathy.ยน There have been suggestions that machine learning will drive changes in health care within a few years, specifically in medical disciplines that require more accurate prognostic models (eg, oncology) and those based on pattern recognition (eg, radiology and pathology).","authors":["Federico Cabitza","Raffaele Rasoini","Gian Franco Gensini"],"meta":["July 2017JAMA The Journal of the American Medical Association 318(6)","DOI:10.1001/jama.2017.7797"],"references":["282435515_Automated_Classification_of_Circulating_Tumor_Cells_and_the_Impact_of_Interobsever_Variability_on_Classifier_Training_and_Performance","311164170_Development_and_Validation_of_a_Deep_Learning_Algorithm_for_Detection_of_Diabetic_Retinopathy_in_Retinal_Fundus_Photographs","305627498_Treatment_for_Multiple_Acute_Cardiopulmonary_Conditions_in_Older_Adults_Hospitalized_with_Pneumonia_Chronic_Obstructive_Pulmonary_Disease_or_Heart_Failure","234089817_How_to_Discriminate_between_Computer-Aided_and_Computer-Hindered_Decisions_A_Case_Study_in_Mammography","51231246_Deskilling_and_adaptation_among_primary_care_physicians_using_two_work_innovations","10706998_Computer_Decision_Support_as_a_Source_of_Interpretation_Error_The_Case_of_Electrocardiograms","8994282_Some_Unintended_Consequences_of_Information_Technology_in_Health_Care_The_Nature_of_Patient_Care_Information_System-Related_Errors"]}
