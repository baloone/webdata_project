{"id":"283515952_THE_MULTI-TERMINAL_VERTEX_SEPARATOR_PROBLEM_POLYHEDRAL_ANALYSIS_AND_BRANCH-AND-_CUT","abstract":"Let G= (Vâˆª T, E) be an undirected graph such that V is a set of vertices, E a set of edges and T a set of terminal vertices. The Multi-terminal vertex separator problem consists in partitioning V into k + 1 subsets {S, V_1 ,..., V_k } minimizing the size of S and such that there is no edge between two subsets V_i and V_j and each subset V_i contains exactly one terminal. Set S is called a separator. In this paper, we show that this problem is NP-complete. We discuss the problem from a polyhedral point of view. We describe some valid inequalities and characterize when they define facets. Using this we develop a Branch-and-Cut algorithm.","authors":["Denis Cornaz","Youcef Magnouche","A Ridha Mahjoub","Sebastien Martin"],"meta":["October 2015","Conference: International Conference on Computers & Industrial Engineering"],"references":["220249450_An_exact_algorithm_for_solving_the_vertex_separator_problem","220209391_On_the_minimum_cut_separator_problem","48183281_The_graphs_with_the_max-Mader-flow-min-multiway-cut_property","2508943_Multiway_Cuts_in_Directed_and_Node_Weighted_Graphs","267464508_Improved_parameterized_algorithm_for_the_multicut_problem","264993463_The_k-Separator_Problem","220589356_The_vertex_separator_problem_A_polyhedral_investigation","51915737_On_Multiway_Cut_Parameterized_above_Lower_Bounds","2939706_Parameterized_Graph_Separation_Problems"]}
