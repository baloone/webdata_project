{"id":"258688539_Two-point_correction_and_minimum_filter-based_nonuniformity_correction_for_scan-based_aerial_infrared_cameras","abstract":"Two-point correction-based nonuniformity correction of a scan-based long\nwave infrared camera can be successful in normal working environments.\nHowever, the method produces strong fixed-pattern noise in cluttered\naerial environments. We analyze the mechanism of such phenomena and\npropose a nonuniformity correction method by combining a reference-based\napproach and a nonlinear filter-based residual offset estimation method.\nThe nonlinear filtering process of row directional minimum filtering\nafter two-point correction can remove the nonuniformity around cluttered\naerial infrared images. Experimental results validate the feasibility of\nthe proposed method.","authors":["Sungho Kim"],"meta":["October 2012Optical Engineering 51(10):6401-","DOI:10.1117/1.OE.51.10.106401"],"references":["252880713_A_chopper-free_measurement-based_parametric-fitting_nonuniformity_correction_system","252479462_Nonuniformity_correction_scheme_for_an_infrared_camera_including_the_background_effect_due_to_camera_temperature_variation","231588490_Scene-Based_Nonuniformity_Correction_for_Focal_Plane_Arrays_by_the_Method_of_the_Inverse_Covariance_Form","231585357_Radiometrically_accurate_scene-based_nonuniformity_correction_for_array_sensors","49782184_Total_variation_approach_for_adaptive_nonuniformity_correction_in_focal-plane_arrays","295265974_Imaging_multi-_point_nonuniformity_correction_method_for_IRFPA","259261727_Algebraic_scene-based_nonuniformity_correction_in_focal_plane_arrays","258688462_Novel_real-time_nonuniformity_correction_solution_for_infrared_focal_plane_arrays_based_on_S-curve_model","258338383_Scene-based_nonuniformity_correction_method_using_multiscale_constant_statistics_Scene-based_nonuniformity_correction_method_using_multiscale_constant_statistics","253846000_New_generation_of_naval_IRST_example_of_EOMS_NG","252698060_Two-point_nonuniformity_correction_based_on_LMS","252131824_A_new_nonuniformity_correction_algorithm_for_infrared_line_scanners_-_art_no_62070Y","243481900_Nonuniformity_two-point_linear_correction_errors_in_infrared_focal_plane_arrays","243217241_New_improved_nonuniformity_correction_for_infrared_focal_plane_arrays","241496465_Temperature_dependence_of_spatial_noise_in_InSb_focal_plane_arrays","241178541_A_self-adaptive_nonuniformity_correction_algorithm_for_infrared_images_combined_with_two-point_correction_along_the_rim","238981761_High_performance_long-wave_infrared_sensor_with_large_zoom_optics_and_high-definition_television_format","234896311_AeroSense_'97","220599531_Scale_invariant_small_target_detection_by_optimizing_signal-to-clutter_ratio_in_heterogeneous_background_for_infrared_search_and_track","5335212_Scene-based_nonuniformity_correction_using_local_constant_statistics","3326994_Nonuniformity_Correction_of_Infrared_Image_Sequences_Using_the_Constant-Statistics_Constraint"]}
