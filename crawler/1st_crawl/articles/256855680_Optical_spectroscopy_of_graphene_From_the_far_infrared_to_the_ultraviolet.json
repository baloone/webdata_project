{"id":"256855680_Optical_spectroscopy_of_graphene_From_the_far_infrared_to_the_ultraviolet","abstract":"The unique electronic structure of graphene leads to several distinctive optical properties. In this brief review, we outline the current understanding of two general aspects of optical response of graphene: optical absorption and light emission. We show that optical absorption in graphene is dominated by intraband transitions at low photon energies (in the far-infrared spectral range) and by interband transitions at higher energies (from mid-infrared to ultraviolet). We discuss how the intraband and interband transitions in graphene can be modified through electrostatic gating. We describe plasmonic resonances arising from the free-carrier (intraband) response and excitonic effects that are manifested in the interband absorption. Light emission, the reverse process of absorption, is weak in graphene due to the absence of a band gap. We show that photoluminescence from hot electrons can, however, become observable either through femtosecond laser excitation or strong electrostatic gating.","authors":["Kin Fai Mak","Long Ju","Feng Wang","Tony F Heinz"],"meta":["August 2012Solid State Communications 152(15):1341â€“1349","DOI:10.1016/j.ssc.2012.04.064"],"references":["261473356_Quantum_Transport_of_Massless_Dirac_Fermions","239559020_Dynamical_Conductivity_and_Zero-Mode_Anomaly_in_Honeycomb_Lattices","238971658_Nonlinear_broadband_photoluminescence_of_graphene_induced_by_femtosecond_laser_irradiation","224120547_Ultrafast_Relaxation_Dynamics_of_Hot_Optical_Phonons_in_Graphene","51699611_Hot_Carrier-Assisted_Intrinsic_Photoresponse_in_Graphene","51618549_Graphene_plasmonics_for_tunable_terahertz_metamaterials","51394540_Universal_Optical_Conductance_of_Graphite","51107563_A_graphene-based_broadband_optical_modulator","50397402_Seeing_Many-Body_Effects_in_Single-_and_Few-Layer_Graphene_Observation_of_Two-Dimensional_Saddle-Point_Excitons","48194341_Drude_weight_plasmon_dispersion_and_ac_conductivity_in_dopedgraphene_sheets","46424467_Excitonic_Effects_in_the_Optical_Conductivity_of_Gated_Graphene","46424210_Ultrafast_Photoluminescence_from_Graphene","46423740_Electron_and_Optical_Phonon_Temperatures_in_Electrically_Biased_Graphene","45931441_Drude_Conductivity_of_Dirac_Fermions_in_Graphene","45929667_The_transport_properties_of_graphene_an_introduction_Rev_Mod_Phys_82_2673","45925709_Graphene_Photonics_and_Optoelectronics","45907806_Tree-level_electron-photon_interactions_in_graphene","44583887_Thermal_infrared_emission_from_biased_grapheme","43080139_Two-Dimensional_Phonon_Transport_in_Supported_Graphene","38082370_Excitonic_Effects_on_the_Optical_Response_of_Graphene_and_Bilayer_Graphene","24409767_Large-Area_Synthesis_of_High-Quality_and_Uniform_Graphene_Films_on_Copper_Foils","24012296_Ultrafast_carrier_kinetics_in_exfoliated_graphene_and_thin_graphite_films","312420713_Solid_State_Physics","290192496_Carbon_Nanotubes_Basic_Concepts_and_Physical_Properties","279868170_Study_on_CCD_online_system_for_monitoring_a_grinding_wheel_in_process_of_point_grinding_on_curve_surface","258879554_Electronic_States_and_Optical_Transitions_in_Solids","257962149_Band_Structure_of_Graphite","255180395_Physics_Properties_of_Carbon_Nanotubes","253792327_Coulomb_Effects_at_Saddle-Type_Critical_Points","252781117_The_Band_Theory_of_Graphite","252665830_Ultraviolet_Absorption_of_Insulators_III_fcc_Alkali_Halides","243311658_Raman_Spectroscopy_in_Graphene","241311285_Observation_of_the_Two-Dimensional_Plasmon_in_Silicon_Inversion_Layers","235501024_Magneto-optical_properties_of_multilayer_graphene","235460365_Dielectric_function_screening_and_plasmons_in_two-dimensional_graphene","235454907_From_graphene_to_graphite_Electronic_structure_around_the_K_point","224083303_Femtosecond_carrier_dynamics_and_saturable_absorption_in_graphene_suspensions","222820515_Raman_Spectroscopy_of_Graphene_and_Graphite_Disorder_Electron-Phonon_Coupling_Doping_and_Nonadiabatic_Effects","200030720_Effects_of_Configuration_Interaction_on_Intensities_and_Phase_Shifts","51911010_Electrodynamics_of_Correlated_Electron_Materials","51793594_Infrared_Spectroscopy_of_Wafer-Scale_Graphene","50409788_Controlling_Inelastic_Light_Scattering_Quantum_Pathways_in_Graphene","49752171_Controlling_Electron-Phonon_Interactions_in_Graphene_at_Ultrahigh_Carrier_Densities","45908118_Electronic_transport_in_two_dimensional_graphene","45906005_Spectroscopic_ellipsometry_of_graphene_and_an_exciton-shifted_van_Hove_peak_in_absorption","40805058_Photo-Thermoelectric_Effect_at_a_Graphene_Interface_Junction","38036294_Angle-Resolved_Photoemission_Spectra_of_Graphene_from_First-Principles_Calculations","26306754_Graphene_Status_and_Prospects","24278992_Ultrafast_Optical-Pump_Terahertz-Probe_Spectroscopy_of_the_Carrier_Relaxation_and_Recombination_Dynamics_in_Epitaxial_Graphene","24239474_Imaging_of_Photocurrent_Generation_and_Collection_in_Single-Layer_Graphene"]}
