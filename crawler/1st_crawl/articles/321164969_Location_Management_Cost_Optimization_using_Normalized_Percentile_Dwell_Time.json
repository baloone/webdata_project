{"id":"321164969_Location_Management_Cost_Optimization_using_Normalized_Percentile_Dwell_Time","abstract":"This work proposes Normalized Percentile Dwell Time Distribution to be incorporated into various bio-inspired algorithms such as Genetic Algorithm and Binary Particle Swarm Optimization for optimizing the total cost of Location Management. Dwell time parameter is critically dependent on users' behaviour within the network. The innate advantage of Normalized Percentile dwell time over the conventionally used absolute dwell time is that it can take only fixed values depending on the number of cells per network area. This helps tremendously in reducing the computational overhead and can be applied to any shape of the network as long as the total number of cells per network remains constant. Evidently, from the simulation result the proposed technique works well for the reference networks in terms of scaling and cost reduction.","authors":["Swati Swayamsiddha","Prateek","Sudhansu Sekhar Singh"],"meta":["October 2017Journal of Engineering Science and Technology Review 10(5):104-107","DOI:10.25103/jestr.105.13"],"references":["316467393_Cost_Reduction_in_Location_Management_Using_Reporting_Cell_Planning_and_Particle_Swarm_Optimization","260712831_Location_Management_in_Cellular_Mobile_Networks","296424410_Location_management_in_mobile_network_A_survey","282256569_Particle_swarm_optimization_for_location_mobility_management","260358192_Analysis_of_Distance-Based_Location_Management_in_Wireless_Communication_Networks","228379325_Dynamic_location_management_in_heterogeneous_cellular_networks","220658485_Dwell_time_modeling_for_wireless_communication_systems_and_problems_of_the_velocity_distribution","4275681_Review_of_Location_Management_in_Cellular_Networks","4198573_A_genetic_algorithm_for_finding_optimal_location_area_configurations_for_mobility_management","4074907_Particle_swarm_optimization_with_mutation"]}
