{"id":"267091089_DRAT-trim_Efficient_Checking_and_Trimming_Using_Expressive_Clausal_Proofs","abstract":"The DRAT-trim tool is a satisfiability proof checker based on the new DRAT proof format. Unlike its predecessor, DRUP-trim, all presently known SAT solving and preprocessing techniques can be validated using DRAT-trim. Checking time of a proof is comparable to the running time of the proof-producing solver. Memory usage is also similar to solving memory consumption, which overcomes a major hurdle of resolution-based proof checkers. The DRAT-trim tool can emit trimmed formulas, optimized proofs, and new TraceCheck + dependency graphs. We describe the output that is produced, what optimizations have been made to check RAT clauses, and potential applications of the tool.","authors":["Nathan Wetzler","Marijn Heule","Warren A.Jr. Hunt"],"meta":["July 2014","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-09284-3_31","Conference: International Conference on Theory and Applications of Satisfiability Testing"],"references":["257967917_Automated_Reencoding_of_Boolean_Formulas","234785386_Fuzzing_and_delta-debugging_SMT_solvers","220944657_Automated_testing_and_debugging_of_SAT_and_QBF_solvers","220944631_Extended_Resolution_Proofs_for_Symbolic_SAT_Solving_with_Quantification","220896292_Clause_Elimination_Procedures_for_CNF_Formulas","220719791_Extended_Resolution_Proofs_for_Conjoining_BDDs","220163290_PicoSAT_Essentials","268667939_Inprocessing_Rules","262310762_Verifying_Refutations_with_Extended_Resolution","262176674_Mechanical_Verification_of_SAT_Refutations_with_Extended_Resolution","261242176_Trimming_while_checking_clausal_proofs","255409904_Conflict-Driven_Clause_Learning_SAT_Solvers","242563585_On_the_Complexity_of_Derivation_in_Propositional_Calculus","221341007_Verification_of_Proofs_of_Unsatisfiability_for_CNF_Formulas","221186214_Verifying_RUP_Proofs_of_Propositional_Unsatisfiability","220616507_Partial-Match_Retrieval_Algorithms","220570682_On_a_Generalization_of_Extended_Resolution","220269179_A_Restriction_of_Extended_Resolution_for_Clause_Learning_SAT_Solvers"]}
