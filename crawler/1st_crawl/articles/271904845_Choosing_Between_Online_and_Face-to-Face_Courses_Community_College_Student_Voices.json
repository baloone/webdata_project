{"id":"271904845_Choosing_Between_Online_and_Face-to-Face_Courses_Community_College_Student_Voices","abstract":"In this study, community college students discussed their experiences with online and face-to-face learning as well as their reasons for selecting online (rather than face-to-face) sections of specific courses. Students reported lower levels of instructor presence in online courses and that they needed to \"teach themselves.\" Accordingly, most students preferred to take only \"easy\" academic subjects online; they preferred to take \"difficult\" or \"important\" subjects face-to-face. To meet students' needs, then, colleges need to either more explicitly build instructor presence and guidance into online courses or continue to provide ample face-to-face sections of courses for those students who prefer them.","authors":["Shanna Smith Jaggars"],"meta":["March 2014American Journal of Distance Education 28(1):27-38","DOI:10.1080/08923647.2014.867697"],"references":["249233937_Designing_Online_Courses_to_Promote_Student_Retention","220167058_Student_Frustrations_with_a_Web-Based_Distance_Education_Course","344589896_The_College_Fear_Factor_How_Students_and_Professors_Misunderstand_One_Another","286832313_Basic_skills_of_education_in_community_colleges_Inside_and_outside_of_classrooms","285634575_Students'_positive_and_negative_experiences_in_hybrid_and_online_classes","283405315_Online_penalty_The_impact_of_online_instruction_on_the_Latino-White_achievement_gap","279656143_Using_the_Community_of_Inquiry_Framework_Survey_for_Multi-Level_Institutional_Evaluation_and_Continuous_Quality_Improvement","274998933_What_Works_in_Professional_Development","254338710_The_Learning_Styles_Expectations_and_Needs_of_Online_Students","250144970_Learner_Autonomy_as_a_Predictor_of_Course_Success_and_Final_Grades_in_Community_College_Online_Courses","241647144_The_Effectiveness_of_Distance_Education_Across_Virginia's_Community_Colleges_Evidence_From_Introductory_College-Level_Math_and_English_Courses","240725545_Delicate_EngagementThe_Lived_Experience_of_Community_College_Students_Enrolled_in_High-Risk_Online_Courses","238396955_Performance_and_perceptions_of_distance_learners_in_cyberspace","235274213_Executive_education_programs_go_back_to_school","234744876_Distance_Education_Report_August_2001_California_Community_Colleges_Fiscal_Years_1995-1996_through_1999-2000","227743094_The_current_state_of_faculty_development_in_two-year_colleges","36711352_Computer-based_instruction_and_remedial_mathematics_A_study_of_student_retention_at_a_Florida_community_college","3230294_Mediators_of_the_Effectiveness_of_Online_Courses","3000526_Online_education_expands_and_evolves"]}
