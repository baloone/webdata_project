{"id":"314258414_Axiomatic_Attribution_for_Deep_Networks","abstract":"We study the problem of attributing the prediction of a deep network to its input features, a problem previously studied by several other works. We identify two fundamental axioms---Sensitivity and Implementation Invariance that attribution methods ought to satisfy. We show that they are not satisfied by most known attribution methods, which we consider to be a fundamental weakness of those methods. We use the axioms to guide the design of a new attribution method called Integrated Gradients. Our method requires no modification to the original network and is extremely simple to implement; it just needs a few calls to the standard gradient operator. We apply this method to a couple of image models, a couple of text models and a chemistry model, demonstrating its ability to debug networks, to extract rules from a deep network, and to enable users to engage with models better.","authors":["Mukund Sundararajan","Ankur Taly","Qiqi Yan"],"meta":["March 2017"],"references":["305196650_Going_deeper_with_convolutions","301897939_Not_Just_a_Black_Box_Learning_Important_Features_Through_Propagating_Activation_Differences","301879981_Layer-Wise_Relevance_Propagation_for_Neural_Networks_with_Local_Renormalization_Layers","301847798_Molecular_Graph_Convolutions_Moving_Beyond_Fingerprints","282000089_Evaluating_the_visualization_of_what_a_Deep_Neural_Network_has_learned","279068412_Understanding_Neural_Networks_Through_Deep_Visualization","265295439_ImageNet_Large_Scale_Visual_Recognition_Challenge","265022827_Visualizing_Higher-Layer_Features_of_a_Deep_Network","220017637_Building_a_Large_Annotated_Corpus_of_English_The_Penn_Treebank","51968606_Building_high-level_features_using_large_scale_unsupervised_learning","45888459_How_to_Explain_Individual_Classification_Decisions","311609301_Inverting_Visual_Representations_with_Convolutional_Networks","311164170_Development_and_Validation_of_a_Deep_Learning_Algorithm_for_Detection_of_Diabetic_Retinopathy_in_Retinal_Fundus_Photographs","310752533_Visualizing_and_understanding_convolutional_networks","307822569_Understanding_deep_image_representations_by_inverting_them","307092419_Learning_Executable_Semantic_Parsers_for_Natural_Language_Understanding","305342147_Why_Should_I_Trust_You_Explaining_the_Predictions_of_Any_Classifier","304127930_Model-Agnostic_Interpretability_of_Machine_Learning","280695871_Compositional_Semantic_Parsing_on_Semi-Structured_Tables","270346003_Values_of_Non-Atomic_Games","269935358_Striving_for_Simplicity_The_All_Convolutional_Net","265469170_Recurrent_Neural_Network_Regularization","265052545_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_Sentence_Classification","261161965_Building_high-level_features_using_large_scale_unsupervised_learning","259399927_Deep_Inside_Convolutional_Networks_Visualising_Image_Classification_Models_and_Saliency_Maps","225781859_Paths_and_Consistency_in_Additive_Cost_Sharing"]}
