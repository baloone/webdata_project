{"id":"321182151_Three_lessons_from_evidence-based_medicine_and_policy_Increase_transparency_balance_inputs_and_understand_power","abstract":"Evidence-based medicine is often described as the ‘template’ for evidence-based policymaking. EBM has evolved over the last 70 years, and now tends to be methodologically pluralistic, operates through specific structures to promote EBM, and is inclusive of a wide range of stakeholders. These strategies allow EBM practitioners to effectively draw on useful evidence, be transparent, and be inclusive; essentially, to share power. We identify three lessons EBP could learn from EBM. Firstly, to be more transparent about the processes and structures used to find and use evidence. Secondly, to consider how to balance evidence and other interests, and how to assemble the evidence jigsaw. Finally–and this is a lesson for EBM too–that understanding power is vital, and how it shapes how knowledge is produced and used. We suggest that advocates of evidence use, and commentators, should focus on thinking about how the type of problem faced by decision-makers should influence what evidence is produced, sought, and used.","authors":["Warren Pearce","Kathryn Oliver"],"meta":["December 2017Palgrave Communications 3(1)","DOI:10.1057/s41599-017-0045-9"],"references":["318604119_Academic_advocacy_in_public_health_Disciplinary_'duty'_or_political_'propaganda'","318588757_Beyond_Counting_Climate_Consensus","316499487_Evidence-based_policymaking_is_not_like_evidence-based_medicine_so_how_far_should_you_go_to_bridge_the_divide_between_evidence_and_policy","316084036_What_makes_evidence-based_policymaking_such_a_useful_myth_The_case_of_NICE_guidance_on_bariatric_surgery_in_the_UK","313711148_The_'good_governance'_of_evidence_in_health_policy","345765022_Against_Democracy","322973577_Defining_'evidence'_in_public_health_a_survey_of_policymakers'_uses_and_preferences","319270439_Evidence-based_best_practice_is_more_political_than_it_looks_A_case_study_of_the_'Scottish_Approach'","315449132_Beyond_Evidence-Based_Policy_in_Public_Health","313140637_A_systematic_review_of_barriers_to_and_facilitators_of_the_use_of_evidence_by_policymakers"]}
