{"id":"312318696_Evaluation_of_drug_management_competency_A_comparison_between_the_360-degree_appraisal_and_manager_assessment","abstract":"Competency assessment is very essential for human resource development. However, there are various types of competency evaluation methods. The aim of this study is to compare the 360-degree appraisal and the manager assessment for evaluating the drug management competency of staff working at Tambon Health Promoting Hospitals in Chonburi Province, Thailand. Self-administered questionnaire was used as the data collection tool. The total of 310 participants was included in this study. The drug management competency level of staff was evaluated using the 360-degree appraisal and the manager assessment. Independent sample t-test was applied to analyze the differences between the two assessment methods. The results revealed no statistical significant discrepancy of the competency score evaluated by different methods. However, small variation in the actual competency score was observed. The competency score evaluated by manager assessment were higher than that of 360-degree appraisal in most of drug management criteria. On the other hand, the competency score for four out of twenty criteria evaluated by managers were lower. This major finding raises an issue of overestimation of the competency level. Therefore, the 360-degree appraisal should be considered as one of the appropriate competency evaluation tools for staff's competency because of its advantage in minimizing the possibility of bias which might be occurred by the conventional manager assessment.","authors":["F Chanjaruporn","Vanida Prasert","L Anuratpanich","Chaoncin Sooksriwong"],"meta":["October 2016"],"references":["232522003_Research_Update_360-Degree_Performance_Assessment","228254106_Construct_Validity_of_Multi-Source_Performance_Ratings_An_Examination_of_the_Relationship_of_Self-_Supervisor-_and_Peer-Ratings_with_Cognitive_and_Personality_Measures","10822959_Using_Theory_to_Evaluate_Personality_and_Job-Performance_Relations","258179914_How_Accurate_Are_Your_Performance_Appraisals","242076821_HOW_DO_360_DEGREE_PERFORMANCE_REVIEWS_AFFECT_EMPLOYEE_ATTITUDES_EFFECTIVENESS_AND_PERFORMANCE","240531000_Performance_management_theory_A_look_from_the_performer's_perspective_with_implications_for_HRD","228919947_Understanding_the_Medicines_Management_Pathway","40897500_User_perceptions_of_multi-source_feedback_tools_for_junior_doctors","8666908_Utilization_of_Performance_Appraisal_Systems_in_Health_Care_Organizations_and_Improvement_Strategies_for_Supervisors"]}
