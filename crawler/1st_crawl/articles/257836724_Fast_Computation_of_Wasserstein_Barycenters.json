{"id":"257836724_Fast_Computation_of_Wasserstein_Barycenters","abstract":"Wasserstein barycenters (Agueh and Carlier, 2011) define a new family of\nbarycenters between N probability measures that builds upon optimal transport\ntheory. We argue using a simple example that Wasserstein barycenters have\ninteresting properties that differentiate them from other barycenters proposed\nrecently, which all build either or both on kernel smoothing and Bregman\ndivergences. We propose two algorithms to compute Wasserstein barycenters for\nfinitely supported measures, one of which can be shown to be a generalization\nof Lloyd's algorithm. A naive implementation of these algorithms is\nintractable, because it would involve numerous resolutions of optimal transport\nproblems, which are notoriously expensive to compute. We propose to follow\nrecent work by Cuturi (2013) and smooth these transportation problems to\nrecover faster optimization procedures. We apply these algorithms to the\nvisualization of perturbed images and resampling in particle filters.","authors":["Marco Cuturi","Arnaud Doucet"],"meta":["October 2013","SourcearXiv"],"references":["258792133_Jeffreys_Centroids_A_Closed-Form_Expression_for_Positive_Histograms_and_a_Guaranteed_Tight_Approximation_for_Frequency_Histograms","230795276_Learning_Probability_Measures_with_respect_to_Optimal_Transport_Metrics","224254882_Earth_mover's_prototypes_A_convex_learning_approach_for_discovering_activity_patterns_in_dynamic_scenes","224135940_Fast_and_Robust_Earth_Mover's_Distances","222493049_A_Convexity_Principle_for_Interacting_Gases","221346477_On_Information-Maximization_Clustering_Tuning_Parameter_Selection_and_Analytic_Solution","220132573_Barycenters_in_the_Wasserstein_Space","47524064_f_-Divergence_Estimation_and_Two-Sample_Homogeneity_Test_Under_Semiparametric_Density-Ratio_Models","38332680_Existence_and_uniqueness_of_monotone_measure-preserving_maps","2940184_Clustering_with_Bregman_Divergences","1918232_Testing_for_Homogeneity_with_Kernel_Fisher_Discriminant_Analysis","309715704_Least_squares_quantization_in_PCM","249476994_Planar_Earthmover_Is_Not_in_L1","237132903_Tsitsiklis_Introduction_to_Linear_Optimization","237129850_Diagonal_Equivalence_to_Matrices_with_Prescribed_Row_and_Column_Sums","237053780_Sinkhorn_Distances_Lightspeed_Computation_of_Optimal_Transportation_Distances","235409843_Methods_of_Information_Geometry","231513381_A_Nonparametric_Ensemble_Transform_Method_for_Bayesian_Inference","224817392_On_Estimation_of_Probability_Density_Function_and_Mode","224011016_Optimal_transport_--_Old_and_new","223139045_On_the_scaling_of_multidimensional_matrices","222872547_Mirror_descent_and_nonlinear_projected_subgradient_methods_for_convex_optimization","221089350_Wasserstein_Barycenter_and_Its_Application_to_Texture_Mixing","220680633_Quantization_and_the_method_of_k-means","220604186_A_note_on_constrained_k-means_algorithms","220343437_Statistical_analysis_of_kernel-based_least-squares_density-ratio_estimation","220319965_A_Unified_Continuous_Optimization_Framework_for_Center-Based_Clustering_Methods","200744518_Sequential_Monte-Carlo_Methods_in_Practice","51944183_Ground_Metric_Learning","41781721_A_Kernel_Method_for_the_Two-Sample-Problem","30815668_A_Fast_Algorithm_for_Matrix_Balancing","23948415_Smooth_minimization_of_non-smooth_functions","3342731_The_centroid_of_the_symmetrical_Kullback-Leibler_distance"]}
