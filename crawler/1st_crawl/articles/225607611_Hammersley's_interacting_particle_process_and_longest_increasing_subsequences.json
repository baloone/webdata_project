{"id":"225607611_Hammersley's_interacting_particle_process_and_longest_increasing_subsequences","abstract":"In a famous paper [8] Hammersley investigated the lengthL\n\nn\nof the longest increasing subsequence of a randomn-permutation. Implicit in that paper is a certain one-dimensional continuous-space interacting particle process. By studying\na hydrodynamical limit for Hammersley's process we show by fairly “soft” arguments that limn\n′1/2\nEL\n\nn\n=2. This is a known result, but previous proofs [14, 11] relied on hard analysis of combinatorial asymptotics.","authors":["Aldous D.J.","P.
