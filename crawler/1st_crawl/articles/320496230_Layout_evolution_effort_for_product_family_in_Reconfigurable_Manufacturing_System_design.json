{"id":"320496230_Layout_evolution_effort_for_product_family_in_Reconfigurable_Manufacturing_System_design","abstract":"This paper describes a multi-objective approach that assesses the evolution and layout transition\nefforts between products of a product family in reconfigurable manufacturing systems (RMS) design.\nThe layout evolution effort is minimized and system performance metrics (i.e., average machine\nutilization and alternative replacement machines within the system) are maximized. The problem\nconsiders various manufacturing constraints as well as various metrics to ensure the high performance of\nthe designed reconfigurable manufacturing system following the generated layouts. The effectiveness of\nthe developed approach is evaluated using an illustrative numerical example. The results show the\neffectiveness of the multi-objective approach to help decision makerâ€™s designing RMS. The approach can\nbe used later to guarantee a better system performance when solving the problems of machine layout in\nthe context of RMS","authors":["Hichem Haddou Benderbal","Mohammed Dahane","Lyes Benyoucef"],"meta":["July 2017IFAC-PapersOnLine 50(1):10166-10171","DOI:10.1016/j.ifacol.2017.08.1764","Project: Evolutionary multi objective optimization approach for the reconfigurable manufacturing system (RMS) design"],"references":["283203454_Design_of_reconfigurable_flow_lines_using_MOPSO_and_maximum_deviation_theory","281551556_A_new_Robustness_index_for_machines_selection_in_Reconfigurable_Manufacturing_System","280939887_Reconfigurable_Manufacturing_Systems","258341873_Optimization_of_Operation_Sequencing_in_CAPP_Using_Superhybrid_Genetic_Algorithms-Simulated_Annealing_Technique","287611575_The_Global_Manufacturing_Revolution_Product-Process-Business_Integration_and_Reconfigurable_Systems","286843614_An_Adapted_NSGA-II_Algorithm_for_a_Reconfigurable_Manufacturing_System_RMS_Design_Under_Machines_Reliability_Constraints","281551387_A_NEW_FLEXIBILITY_INDEX_FOR_MACHINES_SELECTION_IN_RECONFIGURABLE_MANUFACTURING_SYSTEM_DESIGN_PROBLEM_MULTIOBJECTIVE_APPROACH","261587684_A_stochastic_model_of_a_reconfigurable_manufacturing_system_Part_1_A_framework","257177459_A_revised_electromagnetism-like_mechanism_for_layout_design_of_reconfigurable_manufacturing_system","245176733_Facility_Layout_Design_in_a_Changing_Environment"]}
