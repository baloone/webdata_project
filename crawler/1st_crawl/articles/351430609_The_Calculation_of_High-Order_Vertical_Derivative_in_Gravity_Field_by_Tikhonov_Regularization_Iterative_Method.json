{"id":"351430609_The_Calculation_of_High-Order_Vertical_Derivative_in_Gravity_Field_by_Tikhonov_Regularization_Iterative_Method","abstract":"In mathematics, statistics, and computer science, particularly in the fields of machine learning and inverse problems, regularization is a process of introducing additional information in order to solve an ill-posed problem or to prevent overfitting. The Tikhonov regularization method is widely used to solve complex problems in engineering. The vertical derivative of gravity can highlight the local anomalies and separate the horizontal superimposed abnormal bodies. The higher the order of the vertical derivative is, the stronger the resolution is. However, it is generally considered that the conversion of the high-order vertical derivative is unstable. In this paper, based on Tikhonov regularization for solving the high-order vertical derivatives of gravity field and combining with the iterative method for successive approximation, the Tikhonov regularization method for calculating the vertical high-order derivative in gravity field is proposed. The recurrence formula of Tikhonov regularization iterative method is obtained. Through the analysis of the filtering characteristics of this method, the high-order vertical derivative of gravity field calculated by this method is stable. Model tests and practical data processing also show that the method is of important theoretical significance and practical value.","authors":["Wei Du","Yangyang Zhang"],"meta":["May 2021Mathematical Problems in Engineering 2021(3):1-13","DOI:10.1155/2021/8818552"],"references":["333519652_Normalized_shaping_regularization_for_robust_separation_of_blended_data","284879712_Simultaneously_Removing_Noise_and_Increasing_Resolution_of_Seismic_Data_Using_Waveform_Shaping","265383699_Iterative_deblending_of_simultaneous-source_seismic_data_using_seislet-domain_shaping_regularization","256839684_High-precision_potential-field_and_gradient-component_transformations_and_derivative_computations_using_cubic_B-splines","283571070_Seismic_imaging_of_incomplete_data_and_simultaneous-source_data_using_least-squares_reverse_time_migration_with_shaping_regularization","270203152_Spline_Models_for_Observational_Data","268710864_Applied_inverse_problems_in_optics","265357491_Numerical_Methods_for_the_Solution_of_Ill-Posed_Problems","265349209_Pitfalls_in_the_Numerical_Solution_of_Linear_Ill-Posed_Problems","260788709_Nonlinear_Ill-Posed_Problems","249863797_Optimum_second_derivative_and_downward_continuation_filters","250956607_An_Application_of_the_Wiener-Kolmogorov_Smoothing_Theory_to_Matrix_Inversion","243098492_Analysis_of_Discrete_Ill-Posed_Problems_by_Means_of_the_L-Curve","238164424_A_Regularization_Parameter_in_Discrete_Ill-Posed_Problems","236736850_Spline_Models_of_Observational_Data"]}
