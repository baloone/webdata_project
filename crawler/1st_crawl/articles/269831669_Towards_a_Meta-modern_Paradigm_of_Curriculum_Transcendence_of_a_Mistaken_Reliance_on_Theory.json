{"id":"269831669_Towards_a_Meta-modern_Paradigm_of_Curriculum_Transcendence_of_a_Mistaken_Reliance_on_Theory","abstract":"A meta-modern paradigm of a curriculum and teachers√©mpowerment aims at transcending the misfortunes and negative side effects of both modern and post-modern approaches to curriculum reform. Meta-modern approaches focus on the participation of teachers and students in a network of relationships that support new insights into curriculum understandings and practices. Situated learning in communities of teachers and students, reflection in thoughts and actions in a social, cultural and institutional context encourage and support the provision of differentiated opportunities for persons with a biography and not only with a mind and skills, principles underlying the No Child Left Behind Act.","authors":["Mary Koutselini"],"meta":["January 2006Educational Practice and Theory 28(1):55-68","DOI:10.7459/ept/28.1.05"],"references":["348864326_School_Subjects_and_Curriculum_Change","328097162_School-Based_Curriculum_Development_in_Britain_A_Collection_of_Case_Studies","324329266_Theory_and_Resistance_in_Education_A_Pedagogy_for_the_Opposition","292002759_Layered_voices_of_teaching_The_uncannily_correct_and_the_elusively_true","290694809_Conversation_collaboration_and_community_in_the_US_curriculum_field","288922630_Beyond_collaboration_Critical_teacher_development_in_the_postmodern_age","285212762_Discipline_and_Punish","272672985_Curriculum_and_Assessment_Reform","272204615_The_Problem_of_Discipline_in_the_Light_of_Modern_-_Postmodern_Discourse","265611743_Curriculum_Construction_and_Critique"]}
