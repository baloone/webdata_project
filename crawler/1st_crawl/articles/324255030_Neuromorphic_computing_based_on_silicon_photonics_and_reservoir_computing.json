{"id":"324255030_Neuromorphic_computing_based_on_silicon_photonics_and_reservoir_computing","abstract":"We present our latest progress using new neuromorphic paradigms for optical information processing in silicon photonics. We show how passive reservoir computing chips can be used to perform a variety of tasks (bit level tasks, non-linear dispersion compensation, â€¦) at high speeds and low power consumption. In addition, we present a spatial analog of reservoir computing based on pillar scatterers and a cavity, that can be used to speed up classification of biological cells.
