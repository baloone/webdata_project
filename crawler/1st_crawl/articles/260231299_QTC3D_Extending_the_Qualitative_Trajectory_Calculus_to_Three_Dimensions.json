{"id":"260231299_QTC3D_Extending_the_Qualitative_Trajectory_Calculus_to_Three_Dimensions","abstract":"Spatial interactions between agents (humans, animals, or machines) carry\ninformation of high value to human or electronic observers. However, not all\nthe information contained in a pair of continuous trajectories is important and\nthus the need for qualitative descriptions of interaction trajectories arises.\nThe Qualitative Trajectory Calculus (QTC) (Van de Weghe, 2004) is a promising\ndevelopment towards this goal. Numerous variants of QTC have been proposed in\nthe past and QTC has been applied towards analyzing various interaction\ndomains. However, an inherent limitation of those QTC variations that deal with\nlateral movements is that they are limited to two-dimensional motion;\ntherefore, complex three-dimensional interactions, such as those occurring\nbetween flying planes or birds, cannot be captured. Towards that purpose, in\nthis paper QTC3Dis presented: a novel qualitative trajectory calculus that can\ndeal with full three-dimensional interactions. QTC3D is based on\ntransformations of the Frenet-Serret frames accompanying the trajectories of\nthe moving objects. Apart from the theoretical exposition, including definition\nand properties, as well as computational aspects, we also present an\napplication of QTC3D towards modeling bird flight. Thus, the power of QTC is\nnow extended to the full dimensionality of physical space, enabling succinct\nyet rich representations of spatial interactions between agents.","authors":["Nikolaos Mavridis","Nicola Bellotto","Konstantinos Iliopoulos","Nico Van de Weghe"],"meta":["February 2014Information Sciences 26","DOI:10.1016/j.ins.2015.06.002","SourcearXiv"],"references":["287953552_From_sequence_to_trajectory_and_vice_versa_Solving_the_inverse_QTC_problem_and_coping_with_real-world_trajectories","276959705_Point_Set_Topological_Spatial_Relations","261399755_Analysis_of_human-robot_spatial_behaviour_applying_a_qualitative_trajectory_calculus","254238155_A_Review_of_Quantitative_Methods_for_Movement_Data","247603456_Gender_Discrimination_in_Biological_Motion_Displays_Based_on_Dynamic_Cues","290728049_Qualitative_Design_and_Implementation_of_Human-Robot_Spatial_Interactions","289323198_Robot_control_based_on_qualitative_representation_of_human_trajectories","283925025_Maintaining_Knowledge_about_Temporal_Intervals","263102340_Erratum_to_''Temporal_reasoning_based_on_semi-intervals''","260009403_Knowledge_discovery_in_choreographic_data_using_Relative_Motion_matrices_and_Dynamic_Time_Warping"]}
