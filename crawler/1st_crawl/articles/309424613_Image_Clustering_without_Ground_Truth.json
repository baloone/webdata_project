{"id":"309424613_Image_Clustering_without_Ground_Truth","abstract":"Cluster analysis has become one of the most exercised research areas over the past few decades in computer science. As a consequence, numerous clustering algorithms have already been developed to find appropriate partitions of a set of objects. Given multiple such clustering solutions, it is a challenging task to obtain an ensemble of these solutions. This becomes more challenging when the ground truth about the number of clusters is unavailable. In this paper, we introduce a crowd-powered model to collect solutions of image clustering from the general crowd and pose it as a clustering ensemble problem with variable number of clusters. The varying number of clusters basically reflects the crowd workers' perspective toward a particular set of objects. We allow a set of crowd workers to independently cluster the images as per their perceptions. We address the problem by finding out centroid of the clusters using an appropriate distance measure and prioritize the likelihood of similarity of the individual cluster sets. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by applying it on multiple artificial datasets obtained from crowd.","authors":["Abhisek Dash","Sujoy Chatterjee","Tripti Prasad","Malay Bhattacharyya"],"meta":["October 2016"],"references":["221619723_Whose_Vote_Should_Count_More_Optimal_Integration_of_Labels_from_Labelers_of_Unknown_Expertise","220398476_Analyzing_the_Amazon_Mechanical_Turk_Marketplace","220320167_Cluster_Ensembles_-_A_Knowledge_Reuse_Framework_for_Combining_Multiple_Partitions","7799834_Combining_Multiple_Clusterings_Using_Evidence_Accumulation","305397619_Data_Clustering_A_Review","221996717_Objective_Criteria_for_the_Evaluation_of_Clustering_Methods","200504371_The_Rise_of_Crowdsourcing","24056046_Comparing_Partitions","5847258_Cumulative_Voting_Consensus_Method_for_Partitions_with_Variable_Number_of_Clusters"]}
