{"id":"322297102_Recommendation_Techniques_in_Mobile_Learning_Context","abstract":"The objective of this article is to make a\nbibliographic study on the recommendation of learning\nactivities that can integrate user mobility. This type of\nrecommendation makes it possible to exploit the history\nof previous visits in order to offer adaptive learning\naccording to the instantaneous position of the learner and\nthe pedagogy of the guide. To achieve this objective, we\nreview the existing literature on the recommendation\nsystems that integrate contexts such as geographic\nlocation and training profile. Next, we are interested in\nthe social relationships that users can have between\nthemselves. Finally, we focus on the work of\nrecommending mobile learning activities in the context of\nscenarios of field trips.","authors":["Nassim Dennouni","Zohra Slama","Yvan Peter","Luigi Lancieri"],"meta":["October 2017","Project: ad hoc environment for the collection and capitalization of human interactions"],"references":["276530319_Towards_to_an_Bio-inspired_Orchestration_of_Mobile_Learning_Activities","274512986_Model_of_e-Learning_Acceptance_and_Use_for_Teaching_Staff_in_Higher_Education_Institutions","272853143_The_Use_of_Educational_Web_Tools_An_Innovative_Technique_in_Teacher_Education_Courses","272371332_Towards_Improving_Recommender_System_A_Social_Trust-Aware_Approach","269651846_Bio-inspired_Ant_Algorithms_A_review","322743832_Acces_a_l'Information_par_un_Systeme_de_Filtrage_Collaboratif_Controle","313362638_Semantic_modelling_of_user_interests_based_on_cross-folksonomy_analysis","312907789_Ant_system_Optimization_by_a_colony_of_cooperating_agents","283132334_Aurigo_an_Interactive_Tour_Planner_for_Personalized_Itineraries","279257814_Construction_et_peuplement_de_structures_hierarchiques_de_concepts_dans_le_domaine_du_e-tourisme"]}
