{"id":"295406199_The_Basics_of_IT_Audit_Purposes_Processes_and_Practical_Information","abstract":"The Basics of IT Audit: Purposes, Processes, and Practical Information provides you with a thorough, yet concise overview of IT auditing. Packed with specific examples, this book gives insight into the auditing process and explains regulations and standards such as the ISO-27000, series program, CoBIT, ITIL, Sarbanes-Oxley, and HIPPA. IT auditing occurs in some form in virtually every organization, private or public, large or small. The large number and wide variety of laws, regulations, policies, and industry standards that call for IT auditing make it hard for organizations to consistently and effectively prepare for, conduct, and respond to the results of audits, or to comply with audit requirements. This guide provides you with all the necessary information if you're preparing for an IT audit, participating in an IT audit or responding to an IT audit.","authors":["S.D.
