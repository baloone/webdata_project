{"id":"335398155_Comparison_of_Blockchain-Based_Solutions_to_Mitigate_Data_Tampering_Security_Risk","abstract":"Blockchain-based applications are arising because they ensure integrity, anti-tampering, and traceability. The data tampering risk is one of the main security concerns of data-centric applications. By the nature of the blockchain technology, it is befitting a revolutionary solution to mitigate the tampering risk. But there exists no proper guidance to explain how blockchain-based application could mitigate this risk. In this paper, we consider tampering risk management and discuss how blockchain-based applications could mitigate it. The study includes a comparison of different solutions.","authors":["Mubashar Iqbal","Raimundas Matuleviƒçius"],"meta":["August 2019","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-30429-4_2","In book: Business Process Management: Blockchain and Central and Eastern Europe Forum (pp.13-28)"],"references":["333312858_Blockchain-Based_Application_Security_Risks_A_Systematic_Literature_Review","330498481_Blockchain_based_searchable_encryption_for_electronic_health_record_sharing","329230172_Security_in_networks_of_unmanned_aerial_vehicles_for_surveillance_with_an_agent-based_approach_inspired_by_the_principles_of_blockchain","329199239_Decentralizing_the_Stock_Exchange_using_Blockchain_An_Ethereum-based_implementation_of_the_Bucharest_Stock_Exchange","328412960_A_Blockchain-Based_Authorization_System_for_Trustworthy_Resource_Monitoring_and_Trading_in_Smart_Communities","327812253_Blockchain-Based_E-Voting_System","328970267_BlockSee_Blockchain_for_IoT_Video_Surveillance_in_Smart_Cities","328085254_A_Blockchain_Application_for_Medical_Information_Sharing","327518449_Blockchain_and_Big_Data_to_Transform_the_Healthcare","327489345_A_Blockchain-Based_Decentralized_Data_Storage_and_Access_Framework_for_PingER"]}
