{"id":"305037205_Observer-Based_Event-Triggering_Consensus_Control_for_Multiagent_Systems_With_Lossy_Sensors_and_Cyber-Attacks","abstract":"In this paper, the observer-based event-triggering consensus control problem is investigated for a class of discrete-time multiagent systems with lossy sensors and cyber-attacks. A novel distributed observer is proposed to estimate the relative full states and the estimated states are then used in the feedback protocol in order to achieve the overall consensus. An event-triggered mechanism with state-independent threshold is adopted to update the control input signals so as to reduce unnecessary data communications. The success ratio of the launched attacks is taken into account to reflect the probabilistic failures of the attacks passing through the protection devices subject to limited resources and network fluctuations. The purpose of the address problem is to design an observer-based distributed controller such that the closed-loop multiagent system achieves the prescribed consensus in spite of the lossy sensors and cyber-attacks. By making use of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrix, the closed-loop system is transformed into an easy-to-analyze setting and then a sufficient condition is derived to guarantee the desired consensus. Furthermore, the controller gain is obtained in terms of the solution to certain matrix inequality which is independent of the number of agents. An algorithm is provided to optimize the consensus bound. Finally, a simulation example is utilized to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed controller design scheme.","authors":["Derui Ding","Zidong Wang","Daniel W. C.
