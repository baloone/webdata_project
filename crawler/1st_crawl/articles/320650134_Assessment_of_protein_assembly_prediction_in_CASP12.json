{"id":"320650134_Assessment_of_protein_assembly_prediction_in_CASP12","abstract":"We present the results of the first independent assessment of protein assemblies in CASP. A total of 1,624 oligomeric models were submitted by 108 predictor groups for the 30 oligomeric targets in the CASP12 edition. The target assemblies were of diverse topology, composition and prediction difficulty, including eight heteromeric complexes, five viral fibre heads, four dihedral homomers and two membrane dimers. We evaluated the accuracy of oligomeric predictions by comparison to their experimentally determined reference structures at the interface patch and residue contact levels. We find that interface patches are easier to predict than the specific residue contacts. Whereas none of the 15 hard oligomeric targets have successful predictions for the residue contacts at the interface, six have models with resemblance in the interface patch. Successful predictions of interface patch and contacts exist for all of the remaining 15 targets suitable for homology modelling. For the first time in CASP, at least one group improves over the best available template for each target, showing the usefulness of the methods for protein assembly studies. The participation in protein assembly prediction is low and uneven. No target was predicted by all groups and no group submitted predictions for all targets. Three human groups are closely ranked at the top by overall performance, but a server outperforms all other predictors for targets suitable for homology modelling. The state of the art of protein assembly prediction methods is in development and has apparent room for improvement, especially for assemblies without templates.
