{"id":"318259423_Cardiologist-Level_Arrhythmia_Detection_with_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","abstract":"We develop an algorithm which exceeds the performance of board certified cardiologists in detecting a wide range of heart arrhythmias from electrocardiograms recorded with a single-lead wearable monitor. We build a dataset with more than 500 times the number of unique patients than previously studied corpora. On this dataset, we train a 34-layer convolutional neural network which maps a sequence of ECG samples to a sequence of rhythm classes. Committees of board-certified cardiologists annotate a gold standard test set on which we compare the performance of our model to that of 6 other individual cardiologists. We exceed the average cardiologist performance in both recall (sensitivity) and precision (positive predictive value).","authors":["Pranav Rajpurkar","Awni Hannun","Masoumeh Haghpanahi","Codie Bourn"],"meta":["July 2017"],"references":["236836094_Diagnostic_Utility_of_a_Novel_Leadless_Arrhythmia_Monitoring_Device","224268594_Database_for_evaluation_of_algorithms_for_measurement_of_QT_and_other_waveform_intervals_in_the_ECG","20928031_An_approach_to_cardiac_arrhythmia_analysis_using_hidden_Markov_models","8629995_A_Wavelet-Based_ECG_Delineator_Evaluation_on_Standard_Databases","6305026_Errors_in_the_computerized_electrocardiogram_interpretation_of_cardiac_rhythm","325579228_AF_Classification_from_a_Short_Single_Lead_ECG_Recording_the_PhysioNetComputing_in_Cardiology_Challenge_2017","319770414_Identity_Mappings_in_Deep_Residual_Networks","319770272_Delving_Deep_into_Rectifiers_Surpassing_Human-Level_Performance_on_ImageNet_Classification","312890808_Dermatologist-level_classification_of_skin_cancer_with_deep_neural_networks","311609041_Deep_Residual_Learning_for_Image_Recognition","311164170_Development_and_Validation_of_a_Deep_Learning_Algorithm_for_Detection_of_Diabetic_Retinopathy_in_Retinal_Fundus_Photographs","308277201_Identity_Mappings_in_Deep_Residual_Networks","286794765_Dropout_A_Simple_Way_to_Prevent_Neural_Networks_from_Overfitting","286512696_Deep_Residual_Learning_for_Image_Recognition","285843652_NEW_METHOD_FOR_DETECTING_ATRIAL_FIBRILLATION_USING_R-R_INTERVALS","272027131_Delving_Deep_into_Rectifiers_Surpassing_Human-Level_Performance_on_ImageNet_Classification","269722411_DeepSpeech_Scaling_up_end-to-end_speech_recognition","261153442_Deep_convolutional_neural_networks_for_LVCSR","15347154_Detection_of_ECG_characteristic_points_using_wavelet_transform","14399185_Detection_of_frequently_overlooked_electrocardiographic_lead_reversals_using_artificial_neural_networks","11895647_The_impact_of_the_MIT-BIH_arrhythmia_database","7446774_Common_errors_in_computer_electrocardiogram_interpretation","3884956_Arrhythmia_Analysis_Using_Artificial_Neural_Network_and_Decimated_Electrocardiographic_Data","3038108_A_real-time_QRS_detection_algorithm"]}
