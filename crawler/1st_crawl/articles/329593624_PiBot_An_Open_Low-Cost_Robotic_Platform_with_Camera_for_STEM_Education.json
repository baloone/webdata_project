{"id":"329593624_PiBot_An_Open_Low-Cost_Robotic_Platform_with_Camera_for_STEM_Education","abstract":"This paper presents a robotic platform, PiBot, which was developed to improve the teaching of robotics with vision to secondary students. Its computational core is the Raspberry Pi 3 controller board, and the greatest novelty of this prototype is the support developed for the powerful camera mounted on board, the PiCamera. An open software infrastructure written in Python language was implemented so that the student may use this camera as the main sensor of the robotic platform. Furthermore, higher-level commands were provided to enhance the learning outcome for beginners. In addition, a PiBot 3D printable model and the counterpart for the Gazebo simulator were also developed and fully supported. They are publicly available so that students and schools without the physical robot or that cannot afford to obtain one, can nevertheless practice, learn and teach Robotics using these open platforms: DIY-PiBot and/or simulated-PiBot.","authors":["Julio Vega","José María Cañas Plaza"],"meta":["December 2018Electronics 7(12):430","DOI:10.3390/electronics7120430"],"references":["330182360_IniRobot_a_pedagogical_kit_to_initiate_children_to_concepts_of_robotics_and_computer_science","327036615_Robotics_for_soft_skills_training","318539990_Robotics_Education_for_Children_at_Secondary_School_Level_and_Above","313872845_Bringing_Robotics_to_Formal_Education_The_Thymio_Open-Source_Hardware_Robot","320886982_A_versatile_robotic_platform_for_educational_interaction","320679330_Developing_Computational_Thinking_through_a_Virtual_Robotics_Programming_Curriculum","320494294_Teaching_Robotics_in_Secondary_School","317145942_Teaching_Programming_in_Secondary_Education_Through_Embodied_Computing_Platforms_Robotics_and_Wearables","316902831_Initiating_a_pipeline_for_the_computer_industry_Using_scratch_and_LEGO_robotics","315598607_Applying_Robotics_in_School_Education_a_Systematic_Review"]}
