{"id":"318382478_Safety_Analysis_of_Safety-Critical_Systems_Using_State-Space_Models","abstract":"State-space modeling is useful for prognostics of safety-critical systems. However, building such a model that embeds all the system requirements is a challenge. Furthermore, it requires expertise and hence isn't easily understood by all the stakeholders. UML can handle these challenges. A proposed approach converts a UML model into a state-space model. Researchers validated this approach on 13 safety-critical systems for nuclear power plants, focusing on the emergency core cooling system.","authors":["Vinay Kumar","Lalit Singh","Anil Kumar Tripathi","Pooja Singh"],"meta":["January 2017IEEE Software 34(4):38-47","DOI:10.1109/MS.2017.93"],"references":["221430548_Using_UML_profiles_to_interchange_DSML_and_UML_models","4256463_Composite_local-linear_state-space_models_for_the_behavioral_modeling_of_digital_devices","4202403_Learning_nonlinear_state-space_models_for_control","295263893_Ensuring_safety_in_design_of_safety_critical_computer_based_systems","290506894_Early_Prediction_of_Software_Reliability_A_Case_Study_with_a_Nuclear_Power_Plant_System","285842809_Petri_Nets_Properties_Analysis_and_Applications","277919663_Approach_for_parameter_estimation_in_Markov_model_of_software_reliability_for_early_prediction_A_case_study","273474092_Computing_Transition_Probability_in_Markov_Chain_for_Early_Prediction_of_Software_Reliability","261566895_Design_Verification_of_Instrumentation_and_Control_Systems_of_Nuclear_Power_Plants","261194607_State-space_model_generation_of_distribution_networks_for_model_order_reduction_application","232640842_Research_on_Reverse_Engineering_from_Formal_Models_to_UML_Models","221587396_Data-Enriched_Modeling_and_Verification_of_WS-CDL_Based_on_UML_Models","221390072_Mapping_UML_Diagrams_to_a_Petri_Net_Notation_for_System_Simulation","3151730_A_Survey_of_Reliability-Prediction_Procedures_For_Microelectronic_Devices"]}
