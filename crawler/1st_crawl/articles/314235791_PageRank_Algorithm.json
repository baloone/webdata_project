{"id":"314235791_PageRank_Algorithm","abstract":"The way in which the displaying of the web pages is done within a search is not a mystery. It involves applied math and good computer science knowledge for the right implementation. This relation involves vectors, matrixes and other mathematical notations. The PageRank vector needs to be calculated, that implies calculations for a stationary distribution, stochastic matrix. The matrices hold the link structure and the guidance of the web surfer. As links are added every day, and the number of websites goes beyond billions, the modification of the web link's structure in the web affects the PageRank. In order to make this work, search algorithms need improvements. Problems and misbehaviors may come into place, but this topic pays attention to many researches which do improvements day by day. Even though it is a simple formula, PageRank runs a successful business. PageRank may be considered as the right example where applied math and computer knowledge can be fitted together.","authors":["Albi Dode","Silvester Hasani"],"meta":["February 2017","DOI:10.9790/0661-1901030107"],"references":["314906944_A_Modified_Algorithm_to_Handle_Dangling_Pages_using_Hypothetical_Node","275074241_An_Improved_Approach_to_the_PageRank_Problems","252064152_Random_Web_Surfer_PageRank_Algorithm","200111047_Inside_PageRank","38339073_Deeper_Inside_PageRank","2565573_IO-Efficient_Techniques_for_Computing_Pagerank"]}
