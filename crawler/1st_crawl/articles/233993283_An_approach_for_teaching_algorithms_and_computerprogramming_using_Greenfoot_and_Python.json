{"id":"233993283_An_approach_for_teaching_algorithms_and_computerprogramming_using_Greenfoot_and_Python","abstract":"The difficulty in learning and teaching the algorithms and programming subjects is a major concern for managers and teachers of Computer Science (CS) undergraduate courses. These are foundational subjects for CS professionals, yet continue to present a high degree of difficulty in learning for students. This paper presents two experiences we conducted with Computer Science beginner students related to the teaching of computer programming. Results obtained were positive and encouraging in a way that continues to be used with new students in CS courses. We are convinced that other actions like this one are vital for interdisciplinary work, preventing student evasion resulting from the learning environment, casting them as process actors. Algorithms and computer programming are becoming evermore\nnecessary tools for academic and professional development.","authors":["L.R.
