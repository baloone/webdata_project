{"id":"263545132_Centroidal_Bases_in_Graphs","abstract":"We introduce the notion of a centroidal locating set of a graph $G$, that is,\na set $L$ of vertices such that all vertices in $G$ are uniquely determined by\ntheir relative distances to the vertices of $L$. A centroidal locating set of\n$G$ of minimum size is called a centroidal basis, and its size is the\ncentroidal dimension $CD(G)$. This notion, which is related to previous\nconcepts, gives a new way of identifying the vertices of a graph. The\ncentroidal dimension of a graph $G$ is lower- and upper-bounded by the metric\ndimension and twice the location-domination number of $G$, respectively. The\nlatter two parameters are standard and well-studied notions in the field of\ngraph identification.\nWe show that for any graph $G$ with $n$ vertices and maximum degree at\nleast~2, $(1+o(1))\\frac{\\ln n}{\\ln\\ln n}\\leq CD(G) \\leq n-1$. We discuss the\ntightness of these bounds and in particular, we characterize the set of graphs\nreaching the upper bound. We then show that for graphs in which every pair of\nvertices is connected via a bounded number of paths,\n$CD(G)=\\Omega\\left(\\sqrt{|E(G)|}\\right)$, the bound being tight for paths and\ncycles. We finally investigate the computational complexity of determining\n$CD(G)$ for an input graph $G$, showing that the problem is hard and cannot\neven be approximated efficiently up to a factor of $o(\\log n)$. We also give an\n$O\\left(\\sqrt{n\\ln n}\\right)$-approximation algorithm.","authors":["Florent Foucaud","Ralf Klasing","Peter J.
