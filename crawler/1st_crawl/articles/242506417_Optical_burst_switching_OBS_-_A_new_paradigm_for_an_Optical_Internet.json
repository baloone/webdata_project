{"id":"242506417_Optical_burst_switching_OBS_-_A_new_paradigm_for_an_Optical_Internet","abstract":"To support bursty traffic on the Internet (and especially WWW)\nefficiently, optical burst switching (OBS) is proposed as a way to\nstreamline both protocols and hardware in building the future\ngeneration Optical Internet. By leveraging the attractive\nproperties of optical communications and at the same time, taking\ninto account its limitations, OBS combines the best of optical\ncircuit-switching and packet/cell switching. In this paper, the\ngeneral concept of OBS protocols and in particular, those based on\nJust-Enough-Time (JET), is described, along with the applicability\nof OBS protocols to IP over WDM. Specific issues such as the use of\nfiber delay-lines (FDLs) for accommodating processing delay and/or\nresolving conflicts are also discussed. In addition, the\nperformance of JET-based OBS protocols which use an offset time\nalong with delayed reservation to achieve efficient utilization of\nboth bandwidth and FDLs as well as to support priority-based\nrouting is evaluated.","authors":["Chunming Qiao","Myungsik Yoo"],"meta":["January 1999Journal of High Speed Networks 8(1):69-84"],"references":["3647417_Models_of_blocking_probability_in_all-optical_networks_with_andwithout_wavelength_changers","3300122_Reducing_communication_latency_with_path_multiplexing_in_optically_interconnected_multiprocessor_systems","279892859_Algorithms_for_routing_in_a_linear_lightwave_network","221242462_Performance_Analysis_of_Fast_Reservation_Protocol_with_Generalized_Bandwidth_Reservation_Method","3282414_Managing_bandwidth_in_ATM_networks_with_bursty_traffic","2985267_Tag_Switching_Architecture_Overview","2578660_Scheduling_All-to-All_Connections_in_WDM_Rings"]}
