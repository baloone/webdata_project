{"id":"307967586_Privacy-by-Design_Framework_for_Assessing_Internet_of_Things_Applications_and_Platforms","abstract":"The Internet of Things (IoT) systems are designed and developed either as standalone applications from the ground-up or with the help of IoT middleware platforms. They are designed to support different kinds of scenarios, such as smart homes and smart cities. Thus far, privacy concerns have not been explicitly considered by IoT applications and middleware platforms. This is partly due to the lack of systematic methods for designing privacy that can guide the software development process in IoT. In this paper, we propose a set of guidelines, a privacy-by-design framework, that can be used to assess privacy capabilities and gaps of existing IoT applications as well as middleware platforms. We have evaluated two open source IoT middleware platforms, namely OpenIoT and Eclipse SmartHome, to demonstrate how our framework can be used in this way.","authors":["Charith Perera","Ciaran Mccormick","Arosha Bandara","Blaine A.
