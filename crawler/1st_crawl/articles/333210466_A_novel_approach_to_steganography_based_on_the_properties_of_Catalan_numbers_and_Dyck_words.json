{"id":"333210466_A_novel_approach_to_steganography_based_on_the_properties_of_Catalan_numbers_and_Dyck_words","abstract":"This paper presents a new method of data hiding using Catalan numbers and Dyck words. The proposed steganographic solution belongs to the category of techniques based on the key generating process, rather than steganographic techniques such as injecting or substituting bits. The complex stego key consists of three sets of values that provide the technique of a hidden message generation completely. Hidden message is generated based on the data carrier and an adequate complex stego key. An important characteristic of the proposed method is that the data carrier retains its original shape, without supplements or modifications. Proposed method is explained in detail through the general scenario and through concrete examples. State of the art steganographic analysis of the proposed solution is presented in this paper, as well as possible suggestions for application in business information systems, authentication and distribution of secret cryptographic keys.","authors":["Muzafer H.
