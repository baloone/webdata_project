We delineate dual fpfs-point and the Bolzano Weierstrass property for fpfs-sets. We introduce modiﬁed form of an algorithm basedon fpfs-compact topological space to the decision-making problem.","authors":["Muhammad Riaz","Masooma Raza Hashmi"],"meta":["February 2018","Project: m-Polar Neutrosophic Set Topology"],"references":["325263086_Fuzzy_parameterized_fuzzy_soft_topology_with_applications","323303405_Certain_Properties_of_Soft_Metric_Space","317581033_Novel_Concepts_of_Soft_Sets_with_Applications","311515388_Some_Generalized_Aggregation_Operators_for_Cubic_Hesitant_Fuzzy_Sets_and_Their_Applications_to_Multi_Criteria_Decision_Making","309674749_ON_Fuzzy_Infra-Semiopen_Sets","316693276_Fuzzy_Set_Theory_-_and_Its_Applications","314233909_Single-Valued_Neutrosophic_Graph_Structures","311729862_Certain_types_of_soft_graphs","310124396_Certain_Characterization_of_m-Polar_Fuzzy_Graphs_by_Level_Graphs","309672044_Fixed_fuzzy_point_theorems_for_fuzzy_mappings_on_complete_metric_spaces"]}
