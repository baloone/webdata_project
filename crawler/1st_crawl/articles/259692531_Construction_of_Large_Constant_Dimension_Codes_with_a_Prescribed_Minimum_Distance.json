{"id":"259692531_Construction_of_Large_Constant_Dimension_Codes_with_a_Prescribed_Minimum_Distance","abstract":"In this paper we construct constant dimension codes with prescribed minimum distance. There is an increased interest in subspace codes in general since a paper by Kötter and Kschischang where they gave an application in network coding. There is also a connection to the theory of designs over finite fields. We will modify a method of Braun, Kerber and Laue which they used for the construction of designs over finite fields to construct constant dimension codes. Using this approach we found many new constant dimension codes with a larger number of codewords than previously known codes. We finally give a table of the best constant dimension codes we found.","authors":["Sascha Kurz","Axel Kohnert"],"meta":["January 2008","DOI:10.1007/978-3-540-89994-5_4","SourcearXiv","In book: Mathematical Methods in Computer Science (pp.31-42)Edition: Lecture Notes in Computer Science Volume 5393Chapter: Construction of Large Constant Dimension Codes with a Prescribed Minimum DistancePublisher: Springer Berlin HeidelbergEditors: Jaques Calmet, Willi Geiselmann, Jörn Müller-Quade"],"references":["265365443_Construction_of_nr-arcs_in_PG2q","257818523_On_Perfect_Codes_and_Related_Concepts","267124652_Lattice_point_enumeration_and_applications","267082918_Some_new_designs_over_finite_fields","262364612_Systematic_construction_of_q-analogs_of_designs","259384628_Error-Correcting_Linear_Codes_-_Classification_by_Isometry_and_Applications","252655518_Measuring_the_Flattening_of_Dark_Matter_Halos","232327413_t-Designs_on_hypergraphs","226405323_Designs_and_partial_geometries_over_finite_fields","225934354_Designs_over_finite_fields"]}
