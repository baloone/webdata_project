{"id":"326692749_Ultrafast_Deep-Ultraviolet_Laser_Ionization_Mass_Spectrometry_Applicable_To_Identify_Phenylenediamine_Isomers","abstract":"The application of low-fragmentation mass spectrometry to identify chemicals has been recognized of particular importance in chemistry, biomedicine and materials science. Utilizing customized all-solid-state picoseconds-pulsed deep-ultraviolet (DUV) laser, here we present new advances into photoionization mass spectrometry. The DUV laser ionization mass spectrometry (DUV-LIMS) takes on very clean spectra pertaining to minimized structure relaxation and fragmentation under the ultrafast ionization process. Typical DUV-LIMS applications are illustrated not only for small organic molecules, but also for long-chain unsaturated hydrocarbons and the clusters of benzene. The unique advantages of DUV-LIMS enable us to detect and determine confusable organic compound mixture indicating promising applications. Interestingly, DUV-LIMS is also found applicable to identify phenylenediamine isomers. An in-depth analysis of reaction dynamics is provided showing how hydrogen-atom-transfer (HAT) initiates the distinguishable photodissociation of phenylenediamines under near-resonant excitation. In particular, ortho-phenylenediamine (OPD) finds remarkable dehydrogenation product with comparable intensity as the molecular ion peak, which is associated with the quantum tunnelling tautomers providing new subjects to study intramolecular noncovalent interactions.","authors":["Wu Haiming","Chengqian Yuan","Hanyu Zhang","Guanhua Yang"],"meta":["July 2018Analytical Chemistry 90(17)","DOI:10.1021/acs.analchem.8b03167","Project: Superatoms"],"references":["312498264_Dynamical_importance_of_van_der_Waals_saddle_and_excited_potential_surface_in_C1DD2_complex-forming_reaction","260371476_A_protein_engineered_to_bind_uranyl_selectively_and_with_femtomolar_affinity","241331466_Natural_Population_Analysis","234965295_An_Improved_Algorithm_For_Reaction-Path_Following","234879431_Photoionization_Mass_Spectrometer_for_Studies_of_Flame_Chemistry_with_a_Synchrotron_Light_Source","51871563_Multiwfn_A_multifunctional_wavefunction_analyzer","23138436_Selbach_M_Schwanhausser_B_Thierfelder_N_Fang_Z_Khanin_R_Rajewsky_NWidespread_changes_in_protein_synthesis_induced_by_microRNAs_Nature_455_58-63","16211690_Mutagenicity_of_a_New_Hair_Dye_Ingredient_4-Ethoxy-_m_-phenylenediamine","11561854_Observation_of_conformation-specific_pathways_in_the_photodissociation_of_1-iodopropane_ions","11553010_Systematic_Identification_of_Protein_Complexes_in_Saccharomyces_cerevisiae_by_Mass_Spectrometry","8668873_Directional_Dynamics_in_the_Photodissociation_of_Oriented_Molecules","7166456_Control_of_Electron_Localization_in_Molecular_Dissociation","5350543_Modest_stabilization_by_most_hydrogen-bonded_side-chain_interactions_in_membrane_proteins","320117298_Direct_Infusion_Resonance-Enhanced_Multiphoton_Ionization_Mass_Spectrometry_of_Liquid_Samples_under_Vacuum_Conditions","319240222_Novel_Methods_for_the_Chemical_Synthesis_of_Insulin_Superfamily_Peptides_and_of_Analogues_Containing_Disulfide_Isosteres","319226758_Direct_Observation_of_Double_Hydrogen_Transfer_via_Quantum_Tunneling_in_a_Single_Porphycene_Molecule_on_a_Ag110_Surface","318549680_Chemical_Approaches_to_Investigate_Labile_Peptide_and_Protein_Phosphorylation","317251852_Photoreactions_of_Porphyrins_Initiated_by_Deep_Ultraviolet_Single_Photons","315880525_Electrochemical_Nonadiabatic_Electron_Transfer_via_Tunneling_to_Solution_Species_through_Thin_Insulating_Films","315467180_DNA_probes_for_monitoring_dynamic_and_transient_molecular_encounters_on_live_cell_membranes","306296153_The_hydrogen_tunneling_splitting_in_malonaldehyde_A_full-dimensional_time-independent_quantum_mechanical_method","304916193_Photodissociation_of_ultracold_diatomic_strontium_molecules_with_quantum_state_control","295244309_All-solid-state_deep_ultraviolet_laser_for_single-photon_ionization_mass_spectrometry","276157649_Mode-Specific_Tunneling_Splittings_for_a_Sequential_Double-Hydrogen_Transfer_Case_An_Accurate_Quantum_Mechanical_Scheme","270957329_Ab_Initio_Calculation_of_Vibrational_Absorption_and_Circular_Dichroism_Spectra_Using_Density_Functional_Force_Fields","262015398_Note_A_novel_vacuum_ultraviolet_light_source_assembly_with_aluminum-coated_electrodes_for_enhancing_the_ionization_efficiency_of_photoionization_mass_spectrometry","260304608_Natural_bond_orbital_methods","258559388_Mass_Spectrometry-A_Textbook","236339496_Direct_Deamination_of_Primary_Amines_by_Water_To_Produce_Alcohols","234978074_Resonance-enhanced_Multiphoton_Ionization_and_Fragmentation_of_Molecular_Beams_NO_I2_Benzene_and_Butadiene","232789438_Direct_Observation_of_Reptation_at_Polymer_Interfaces","51145787_Single_Photon_Ionization_and_Chemical_Ionization_Combined_Ion_Source_Based_on_a_Vacuum_Ultraviolet_Lamp_for_Orthogonal_Acceleration_Time-of-Flight_Mass_Spectrometry","51035637_Diaminobenzenes_An_Experimental_and_Computational_Study","41547429_Vacuum_Ultraviolet_Photofragmentation_of_Sarcosine_Photoionization_Mass_Spectrometric_and_Theoretical_Insights","26765913_Recent_Applications_of_Synchrotron_VUV_Photoionization_Mass_Spectrometry_Insight_into_Combustion_Chemistry","11643464_Mass_Analysis_at_the_Advent_of_the_21st_Century","10857914_Mass_Spectrometry-Based_Proteomics","7049285_Probing_Nitrogen-Sensitive_Steps_in_the_Free-Radical-Mediated_Deamination_of_Amino_Alcohols_by_Ethanolamine_Ammonia-Lyase","7005789_The_Role_of_Excited_States_in_the_Photodissociation_of_Heteroaromatic_Molecules","6022195_Use_of_Lasers_to_Control_Selective_Chemical_Reactions","5574082_International_interest"]}
