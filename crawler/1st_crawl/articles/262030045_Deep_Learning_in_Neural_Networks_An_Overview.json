{"id":"262030045_Deep_Learning_in_Neural_Networks_An_Overview","abstract":"In recent years, deep neural networks (including recurrent ones) have won\nnumerous contests in pattern recognition and machine learning. This historical\nsurvey compactly summarises relevant work, much of it from the previous\nmillennium. Shallow and deep learners are distinguished by the depth of their\ncredit assignment paths, which are chains of possibly learnable, causal links\nbetween actions and effects. I review deep supervised learning (also\nrecapitulating the history of backpropagation), unsupervised learning,\nreinforcement learning & evolutionary computation, and indirect search for\nshort programs encoding deep and large networks.","authors":["Juergen Schmidhuber"],"meta":["April 2014Neural networks: the official journal of the International Neural Network Society 61","DOI:10.1016/j.neunet.2014.09.003","SourcearXiv"],"references":["324127772_A_spiking_network_model_of_short-term_active_memory","311100814_Comparing_Biases_for_Minimal_Network_Construction_with_Back-Propagation","308350038_On_Information_Theory_and_Unsupervised_Neural_Networks","304541412_Forming_sparse_representations_by_local_anti-Hebbian_learning","289917319_Deep_Neural_Networks_for_object_detection","289351128_Sequence_discriminative_distributed_training_of_long_short-term_memory_recurrent_neural_networks","289194446_Deep_learning_for_real-time_Atari_game_play_using_offline_Monte-Carlo_tree_search_planning","329323147_Dynamic_neural_networks_and_optimal_signal_processing","319770626_Multi-column_Deep_Neural_Networks_for_Image_Classification","319770465_Sequence_to_Sequence_Learning_with_Neural_Networks","319770430_Rich_feature_hierarchies_for_accurate_object_detection_and_semantic_segmentation","319770418_Maxout_Networks","319770386_Sum-Product_Networks_A_New_Deep_Architecture","319770357_DeCAF_A_Deep_Convolutional_Activation_Feature_for_Generic_Visual_Recognition","319770184_Speech_Recognition_With_Deep_Recurrent_Neural_Networks","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","319770146_Second_Order_Derivatives_for_Network_Pruning_Optimal_Brain_Surgeon","313706874_Adaptation_in_natural_and_artificial_systems","313601183_Optimal_brain_damage_in","313569292_Identification_and_control_of_dynamical_systems_using_neural_networks","313527089_Distinctive_image_features_from_scale-invariant_key_points","313523821_Data_compression_feature_extraction_and_autoassociation_in_feedforward_neural_networks","313505421_Completely_derandomized_self-adaptation_in_evolution_strategies","313202637_Nonlinear_neurons_in_the_low_noise_limit_A_factorial_code_maximises_information_transfer","313178107_Theoria_combinationis_observationum_erroribus_minimis_obnoxiae","312990324_Td-gammon_a_self-Teaching_backgammon_program_achieves_master-level_play","312986214_Some_studies_in_machine_learning_using_the_game_of_checkers","312662323_Universal_sequential_search_problems","312618723_The_Group_Method_of_Data_Handling-A_rival_of_the_Method_of_Stochastic_Approximation","312466014_Deep_Sparse_Rectifier_Networks","312388360_Q-learning","311909370_A_Class_of_Methods_for_Solving_Nonlinear_Simultaneous_Equations","310752533_Visualizing_and_understanding_convolutional_networks","310752071_Natural_image_denoising_with_convolutional_networks","310055484_A_practical_bayesian_framework_for_backprop_networks","308059469_Cross-Validatory_Choice_and_Assessment_of_Statistical_Predictions","304533936_A_simple_weight_decay_can_improve_generalization","304405348_On_computable_numbers_with_an_application_to_the_Entscheidungsproblem","304355198_Average_Reward_Reinforcement_Learning_Foundations_Algorithms_and_Empirical_Results","304109482_Training_products_of_experts_by_minimizing_contrastive_divergence","303962175_Gradient_Calculations_for_Dynamic_Recurrent_Neural_Networks","303494467_Conditioning_of_quasi-Newton_methods_for_function_minimization","300902900_Policy-Gradient_Algorithms_for_Partially_Observable_Markov_Decision_Processes","298606994_Ensemble_methods_in_machine_learning","298366712_How_to_create_a_mind_The_secret_of_human_thought_revealed","297249647_DYNAMIC_LEARNING_RATE_OPTIMIZATION_OF_THE_BACKPROPAGATION_ALGORITHM","293143834_A_theoretical_framework_for_back-propagation","290072435_Associative_Storage_and_Retrieval_of_Digital_Information_in_Networks_of_Adaptive_Neurons","289703238_How_to_Solve_Classification_and_Regression_Problems_on_High-Dimensional_Data_with_a_Supervised_Extension_of_Slow_Feature_Analysis","288623601_Towards_end-to-end_speech_recognition_with_recurrent_neural_networks","288448501_The_Intelligent_Movement_Machine_An_Ethological_Perspective_on_the_Primate_Motor_System","287741874_TTS_synthesis_with_bidirectional_LSTM_based_Recurrent_Neural_Networks","287287907_Automatic_language_identification_using_Long_Short-Term_Memory_recurrent_neural_networks","287118048_IEE_J_Comm_Eng","287034172_Fast_dropout_training"]}
