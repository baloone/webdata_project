{"id":"342911025_The_development_of_academic_and_nonacademic_race_stereotypes_in_African_American_adolescents","abstract":"The purpose of this longitudinal study was to examine developmental change and gender differences in the Black-White race stereotype endorsement of African American adolescents. In Grades 7, 10, and 12, African American students (N = 563; 313 girls) reported their perceptions of the competence of Blacks and Whites in academic, music, and sports domains. Multilevel growth modeling (MLM) was used to assess change from Grade 7 to Grade 12. Separate models tested academic (English, math, science) and nonacademic (music and sports) stereotypes. Across time points, students reported higher competence for Whites than Blacks in English, math, and science and higher competence for Blacks in music and sports. Academic stereotype endorsement increased between Grades 7 and 10, and students' endorsement of music and sports stereotypes decreased over time. Girls endorsed race stereotypes favoring Whites in math and science more strongly than boys. Boys reported stronger sports stereotypes than girls. Results highlight the value of intersectional approaches to studying stereotypes, as factors linked to gender identity may play a role in Black youths' race stereotype endorsement.
