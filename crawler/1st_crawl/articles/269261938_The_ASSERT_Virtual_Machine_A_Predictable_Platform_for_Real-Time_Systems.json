{"id":"269261938_The_ASSERT_Virtual_Machine_A_Predictable_Platform_for_Real-Time_Systems","abstract":"The development of real-time control systems is a complex process which has to face often conﬂicting requirements, especially those related to the performance of the control methods and the real-time behaviour of the system. The ASSERT Virtual Machine provides a reliable execution platform for such systems, which allows developers to cope with functional and real-time aspects separately. In order to guarantee the required real-time properties, the virtual machine only accepts software components which have a predictable temporal behaviour which can be analysed at system design time. Such components can be automatically generated from a high-level description of a system which embodies the functional components (e.g. control algorithms) into a set of containers providing the appropriate concurrent and real-time behaviour. The ASSERT Virtual Machine has been implemented in Ada 2005, using a predictable tasking subset of the language known as the Ravenscar proﬁle. A prototype has been validated on several pilot-scale spacecraft control systems, with good results.","authors":["Juan Antonio de la Puente"],"meta":["July 2008","DOI:10.3182/20080706-5-KR-1001.01810","Conference: World Congress"],"references":["3207468_How_Does_Control_Timing_Affect_Performance_Analysis_and_Simulation_of_Timing_Using_Jitterbug_and_TrueTime","225157178_A_Metamodel-Driven_Process_Featuring_Advanced_Model-Based_Timing_Analysis","224647006_Property-Preserving_Reuse-Geared_Approach_to_Model-Driven_Development","221033051_Correctness_by_Construction_for_High-Integrity_Real-Time_Systems_A_Metamodel-Driven_Approach"]}
