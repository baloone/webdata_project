{"id":"332607159_Two_Steps_Iterative_Methods_for_Solving_Nonlinear_Equations","abstract":"In this paper, we suggest and analyze some two steps iterative methods for solving nonlinear equations by a series expansion of the nonlinear function. We have shown that these methods are cubic convergence methods. Several examples are given to illustrate the efficiency of these methods and their comparison with other methods. These new methods can be viewed as significant modification and improvement of the Newton method and it's variant.","authors":["Oghovese Ogbereyivwe","Emunefe John"],"meta":["August 2014","Project: Iterative methods for solution of nonlinear and system of nonlinear equations."],"references":["266871332_New_Two-Step_Iterative_Methods_for_Solving_Nonlinear_Equations","265057835_Some_new_iterative_methods_for_solving_nonlinear_equations","237416965_Quadrature_based_two-step_iterative_methods_for_non-linear_equations1","233926245_A_Family_of_Predictor-Corrector_Methods_Based_on_Weight_Combination_of_Quadratures_for_Solving_Nonlinear_Equations","265330420_Solution_of_Equations_and_Systems_of_Equations","238833658_Iterative_Methods_for_Solution_of_Equations"]}
