CITIES around the world are currently under quick transition toward a low-carbon environment, high quality of living, and resource-efficient economy. Smart systems are crucial components for building sustainable cities and aggregating comprehensive urban informatics. Internet-of-Things (IoT) is an emerging technology evolved from the convergence of wireless technologies, embedded systems, and the Internet. Extensive research on IoT is taking place on sensing and automatic control, network infrastructure and communication, and big data analytics. This facilitates a multidisciplinary approach for developing integrated solutions and creating novel applications to build a sustainable society. Combinations of IoT with autonomous systems, machine intelligence, sensor and actuator networks provide smart functions in wide application domains, including environmental monitoring, smart transportation, industrial production, and security surveillance. This special section on Internet-of-Things for smart cities and urban informatics is focused on the development, adoption, and application of IoT technology to improve the efficiency of cities and enhance urban services in society. It covers topics including smart transportation, smart buildings, data transmission and analytics, system designs, and experiments of IoT for smart cities.","authors":["Edith Ngai","Falko Dressler","Victor Leung","Mo Li"],"meta":["April 2017IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics 13(2):748-750","DOI:10.1109/TII.2017.2675379","Project: GreenIoT"],"references":[]}
