{"id":"292945954_Cyberbullying_in_Adolescence","abstract":"The aim of this article was to present a detailed analysis of the concept of cyberbullying. Research on the topic of cyberbullying is growing exponentially, but not all studies use the same definition to examine this concept. A concept analysis in the style of Walker and Avant was used to analyze cyberbullying. Literature was retrieved from the databases of CINAHL and PubMed between the years 2009 and October 2014 using the key word \"cyberbullying.\" Twenty-five English-language articles were located that delineated a definition of cyberbullying. First, articles were analyzed to discover the defining attributes of cyberbullying. Second, antecedents, consequences, and related terms of cyberbullying were examined. Third, an operational definition of cyberbullying is proposed on the basis of a consensus of the review. This review proposes that the defining attributes of cyberbullying are: (1) electronic form of contact (2) an aggressive act (3) intent (4) repetition (publicity), and (5) harm of the victim. The antecedents most often mentioned were lower self-esteem, higher levels of depression, and social isolation and the consequences were academic problems and affective disorders. A single concise definition of cyberbullying was created that can be utilized by health care providers to educate their patients and families about cyberbullying. This definition also can be used to guide research to develop effective interventions.","authors":["Elizabeth Hutson"],"meta":["February 2016ANS.
