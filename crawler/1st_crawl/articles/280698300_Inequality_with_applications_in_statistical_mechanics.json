{"id":"280698300_Inequality_with_applications_in_statistical_mechanics","abstract":"We prove for Hermitian matrices (or more generally for completely continuous self-adjoint linear operators in Hilbert space) A and B that Tr (eA+B) ≤ Tr (eAeB). The inequality is shown to be sharper than the convexity property (0 ≤ α ≤ 1) Tr (e αA+(1-α)B) ≤ [Tr (eA)]α[Tr (eB)]1-α, and its possible use for obtaining upper bounds for the partition function is discussed briefly.","authors":["C.J.
