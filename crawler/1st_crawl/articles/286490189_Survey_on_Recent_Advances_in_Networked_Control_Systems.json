{"id":"286490189_Survey_on_Recent_Advances_in_Networked_Control_Systems","abstract":"Networked control systems are systems whose control loops are closed through communication networks such that both control signals and feedback signals can be exchanged among system components (sensors, controllers, actuators and so on). Networked control systems have a broad range of applications in areas such as industrial control and signal processing. This survey provides an overview on the theoretical development of networked control systems. In-depth analysis and discussion is made on sampled-data control, networked control, event-triggered control. More specifically, existing research methods on networked control systems are summarized. Furthermore, as an active research topic, network-based filtering is reviewed briefly. Finally, some challenging problems are presented to direct the future research.","authors":["Xian-Ming Zhang","Qing-Long Han","Xinghuo Yu"],"meta":["January 2015IEEE Transactions on Industrial
