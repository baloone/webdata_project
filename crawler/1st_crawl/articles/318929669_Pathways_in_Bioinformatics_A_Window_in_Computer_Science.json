{"id":"318929669_Pathways_in_Bioinformatics_A_Window_in_Computer_Science","abstract":"Bioinformatics is an emerging field galvanized by intense research in computational and molecular biology. It continues to grow with vast potential for the present and future. As a result, the role of computer science in driving research and results forward remains crucial. Yet this field is barely understood. It is not in the standard domain of course curriculum in many institutions, even at post graduate level. This paper looks at Bioinformatics from the perspectives of Computer Science. In the process, provides entry point and pathways for more active and productive participation.","authors":["Chinweike Agbachi"],"meta":["July 2017","DOI:10.14445/22312803/IJCTT-V49P113","Project: Trends and Innovations"],"references":["315481835_Design_and_Application_of_Concurrent_Double_Key_Survey_Data_Structures","267425153_The_Evolution_of_Sequence_Comparison_Algorithms","49278896_Using_Finite_State_Automata_for_Sequence_Mining","48457051_DNA_Sequence_Representation_by_Use_of_Statistical_Finite_Automata","4336540_Ordered_Index_Seed_Algorithm_for_Intensive_DNA_Sequence_Comparison","2543721_Learning_Stochastic_Regular_Grammars_by_Means_of_a_State_Merging_Method","303574209_Bioinformatics_Benefits_to_mankind"]}
