{"id":"334385977_Building_Jiminy_Cricket_An_Architecture_for_Moral_Agreements_Among_Stakeholders","abstract":"An autonomous system is constructed by a manufacturer, operates in a society subject to norms and laws, and is interacting with end-users. We address the challenge of how the moral values and views of all stakeholders can be integrated and reflected in the moral behavior of the autonomous system. We propose an artificial moral agent architecture that uses techniques from normative systems and formal argumentation to reach moral agreements among stakeholders. We show how our architecture can be used not only for ethical practical reasoning and collaborative decision-making, but also for the explanation of such moral behavior.","authors":["Beishui Liao","Marija Slavkovik","Leon van der Torre"],"meta":["January 2019","DOI:10.1145/3306618.3314257","Conference: the 2019 AAAI/ACM Conference"],"references":["327837762_Explanatory_Predictions_with_Artificial_Neural_Networks_and_Argumentation","317821828_Explanation_in_Artificial_Intelligence_Insights_from_the_Social_Sciences","317126510_An_architecture_for_ethical_robots_inspired_by_the_simulation_theory_of_cognition","316169632_Incorporating_Ethics_into_Artificial_Intelligence","315098777_Towards_Moral_Autonomous_Systems","289991903_Formal_verification_of_ethical_choices_in_autonomous_systems","283439063_Sacrifice_One_For_the_Good_of_Many_People_Apply_Different_Moral_Norms_to_Human_and_Robot_Agents","275055248_Towards_Verifiably_Ethical_Robot_Behaviour","262394690_Using_Argumentation_Schemes_for_Argument_Extraction_A_Bottom-Up_Method","261871702_GenEth_A_General_Ethical_Dilemma_Analyzer","260686535_Moral_Decision_Making_in_Autonomous_Systems_Enforcement_Moral_Emotions_Dignity_Trust_and_Deception","220629129_The_Nature_Importance_and_Difficulty_of_Machine_Ethics","220629117_Toward_a_General_Logicist_Methodology_for_Engineering_Ethically_Correct_Robots","220607991_A_dialogue_system_specification_for_explanation","220388204_Persuasion_and_Value_in_Legal_Argument","330299605_On_the_Distinction_between_Implicit_and_Explicit_Ethical_Agency","330297380_Cake_Death_and_Trolleys_Dilemmas_as_benchmarks_of_ethical_decision-making","327837582_Explanation_for_Case-Based_Reasoning_via_Abstract_Argumentation","318830177_Responsible_Autonomy","314293302_The_Hybrid_Ethical_Reasoning_Agent_IMMANUEL","285432624_On_the_acceptability_of_arguments_and_its_fundamental_role_in_nonmonotonic_reasoning_and_logic_programming","277502238_Persuasion_and_Value_in_Legal_Argument","257931380_Moral_Machines_Teaching_Robots_Right_From_Wrong","236017230_A_General_Account_of_Argumentation_and_Preferences","226980905_Credulous_and_Sceptical_Argument_Games_for_Preferred_Semantics","226227153_Conflicts_of_Norms_and_the_Revision_of_Normative_Systems","222464284_On_the_acceptability_of_arguments_and_its_fundamental_role_in_nonmonotonic_reasoning_logic_programming_and_n-person_games_1","2323088_Credulous_and_Sceptical_Argument_Games_for_Preferred_Semantics"]}
