{"id":"264459266_A_RobustICA_Based_Algorithm_for_Blind_Separation_of_Convolutive_Mixtures","abstract":"We propose a frequency domain method based on robust independent component\nanalysis (RICA) to address the multichannel Blind Source Separation (BSS)\nproblem of convolutive speech mixtures in highly reverberant environments. We\nimpose regularization processes to tackle the ill-conditioning problem of the\ncovariance matrix and to mitigate the performance degradation in the frequency\ndomain. We apply an algorithm to separate the source signals in adverse\nconditions, i.e. high reverberation conditions when short observation signals\nare available. Furthermore, we study the impact of several parameters on the\nperformance of separation, e.g. overlapping ratio and window type of the\nfrequency domain method. We also compare different techniques to solve the\nfrequency-domain permutation ambiguity. Through simulations and real world\nexperiments, we verify the superiority of the presented convolutive algorithm\namong other BSS algorithms, including recursive regularized ICA (RR ICA),\nindependent vector analysis (IVA).","authors":["Zaid Albataineh","Fathi M.
