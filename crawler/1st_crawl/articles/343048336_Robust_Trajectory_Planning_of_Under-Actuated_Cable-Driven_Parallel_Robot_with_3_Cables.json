{"id":"343048336_Robust_Trajectory_Planning_of_Under-Actuated_Cable-Driven_Parallel_Robot_with_3_Cables","abstract":"Cable-driven parallel robots (CDPRs) are under-actuated if they use a number of cables smaller than the degrees of freedom (DoF) of the end-effector (EE). For these robots, the constraint deficiency on the EE may lead to undesirable EE oscillations along the path that it is supposed to track. This paper proposes a trajectory-planning method for underactuated CDPRs which is robust against dynamic-model uncertainties or parameter variation, aiming at minimizing EE oscillations along a prescribed path. Oscillation reduction and robustness are achieved by means of Zero-Vibration Multi-Mode Input Shaping and Dynamic Scaling of a reference trajectory. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the method on a 3-cable 6-DoF robot.","authors":["Edoardo Idà","Sébastien Briot","Marco Carricato"],"meta":["January 2021","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-50975-0_9","In book: Advances in Robot Kinematics 2020 (pp.65-72)"],"references":["245373107_Vibration_Reduction_Using_Multi-Hump_Input_Shapers","345425191_Oscillation_Reduction_and_Frequency_Analysis_of_Under-Constrained_Cable-Driven_Parallel_Robot_with_Three_Cables","335439605_Rest-to-Rest_Trajectory_Planning_for_Underactuated_Cable-Driven_Parallel_Robots","325115652_Oscillation_damping_of_nonlinear_control_systems_based_on_the_phase_trajectory_length_concept_An_experimental_case_study_on_a_cable-driven_parallel_robot","281909732_Solving_the_direct_geometrico-static_problem_of_underconstrained_cable-driven_parallel_robots_by_interval_analysis","265824432_Dynamic_Scaling_of_Manipulator_Trajectories","260634708_Merlet_JP_Stability_analysis_of_underconstrained_cable-driven_parallel_robots_IEEE_Trans_Robotics_291_288-296","257880701_Trajectory_Planning_for_Automatic_Machines_and_Robots","37596890_Preshaping_Command_Inputs_to_Reduce_System_Vibration","3352101_Convolved_and_simultaneous_two-mode_input_shapers"]}
