{"id":"290395915_Assessing_Faculty_Attitudes_toward_Universal_Design_Instructional_Techniques","abstract":"Rehabilitation counselors (RCs) routinely work in postsecondary settings serving students with disabilities and interact with campus faculty, staff, and/or administrators on behalf of students they serve. The purpose of the study was to utilize the Inclusive Teaching Strategies Inventory (ITSI) to measure faculty attitudes towards inclusive teaching strategies. The ITSI survey includes items related to traditional academic accommodations, but also includes items related to Universal Design (UD) instructional techniques. The survey was sent electronically to 1,621 faculty at a Midwestern research University and 397 faculty members participated. Results of the study validate findings from previous research on faculty attitudes and concluded that factors such as previous disability-related training and having taught students with disabilities, influenced attitudes toward accommodations and UD instructional concepts. Faculty age and years of teaching experience were not factors associated with attitudes as measured by the ITSI. RCs employed in postsecondary settings may use the results of this study as a guide when interacting or training faculty regarding accommodations or UD instructional techniques. RCs may also consider administering the ITSI to specific faculty populations on their respective campuses as a precursor to training. Implications for RCs employed in postsecondary settings are provided.","authors":["Bryan K.
