{"id":"220422660_On_Visual_Formalisms","abstract":"The higraph, a general kind of diagramming object, forms a visual formalism of topological nature. Higraphs are suited for a wide array of applications to databases, knowledge representation, and, most notably, the behavioral specification of complex concurrent systems using the higraph-based language of statecharts.","authors":["David Harel"],"meta":["May 1988Communications of the ACM 31(5):514-530","DOI:10.1145/42411.42414","SourceDBLP"],"references":["262323049_A_net_structure_for_semantic_information_storage_deduction_and_retrieval","240399893_Visual_specification_of_security_constraints","234808699_A_simplied_universal_relation_assumption_and_its_properties","220432198_Degrees_of_Acyclicity_for_Hypergraphs_and_Relational_Database_Schemes","220404706_Lamport_L_Proving_Liveness_Properties_of_Concurrent_Programs_TOPLAS_43_455-495","2961070_Hypertext_An_Introduction_and_Survey","313221749_Integrity_checking_in_a_logic-oriented_ER_model","300921691_A_PREDICATE_CALCULUS_BASED_SEMANTIC_NETWORK_FOR_DEDUCTIVE_SEARCHING","284904591_Semantic_Memory","269003494_Logic_Machines_and_Diagrams","263442039_Statistical_Graphics_Design_Principles_and_Practices","262726678_Statecharts_A_Visual_Formalism_For_Complex_Systems","262396232_Communicating_Sequential_Process","262158908_Connections_in_acyclic_hypergraphs_extended_abstract","251344252_Specification_and_verification_of_concurrent_programs_by_A_automata","247035298_On_the_Development_of_Reactive_Systems","246680991_Lettres_a_Une_Princesse_d''Allemagne","243097524_Nonanalytic_Aspects_of_Mathematics_and_Their_Implication_for_Research_and_Education","236157145_On_the_formal_semantics_of_statecharts","235737459_Solutio_Problematis_ad_geometriam_situs_pertinentis","235177057_What's_in_a_Link_Foundations_for_Semantic_Networks","233168734_On_the_Diagrammatic_and_Mechanical_Representation_of_Propositions_and_Reasonings","233152493_Pictures_of_programs_and_other_processes_or_how_to_do_things_with_lines","222281826_When_do_diagrams_make_good_computer_languages","221269166_An_Entity-Relationship_Approach_to_Modelling_Petroleum_Engineering_Database","220812453_Expanding_the_Utility_of_Semantic_Networks_Through_Partitioning","220687483_Multiple_Views_and_Abstractions_with_an_Extended-Entity-Relationship_Model","220404241_A_Distributed_Alternative_to_Finite-State-Machine_Specifications"]}
