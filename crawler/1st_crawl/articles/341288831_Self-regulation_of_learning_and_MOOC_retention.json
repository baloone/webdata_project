{"id":"341288831_Self-regulation_of_learning_and_MOOC_retention","abstract":"Background\nDue to MOOC high attrition rates, this study aims to assess differences in self-regulated learning strategies and other variables related to MOOC retention (perceived effectiveness, MOOC interaction, motivation and socio-demographic characteristics) between course completers and non-completers. This work also aims to translate into Spanish and validate an instrument for the assessment of self-regulated learning (SRL) behaviours in MOOCs. Materials and methods: 582 participants answered the translated SRL questionnaire and other questions related to MOOC retention. The comparison between MOOC completers and non-completers was carried out in a subgroup of 176 undergraduate students. Results: Completer students were more capable of self-regulating their learning and showed significantly higher levels of perceived effectiveness and of engagement with MOOC contents than non-completers. In addition,a logistic regression analysis indicated that the variables with greatest predictive value to discriminate between completers and non-completers were goal-setting, task interest and the academic discipline of studies of MOOC participants. The percentage of cases correctly predicted by the model was over 84%. The Spanish version of the instrument replicated the original factor structure of the SRL questionnaire and showed high internal consistency (α = 0.948).","authors":["Reparaz Charo","Maite
