{"id":"244958006_A_Loopless_Generation_of_Bitstring_without_p_Consecutive_Ones","abstract":"Let F\nn\n(p)\nbe the set of all n-length bitstrings such that there are no p consecutive ls. F\nn\n(p) is counted with the pth order Fibonacci numbers and it may be regarded as the subsets of {1, 2,â€¦, n} without p consecutive elements and bitstrings in F\nn\n(p) code a particular class of trees or compositions of an integer. In this paper we give a Gray code for F\nn\n(p) which can be implemented in a recursive generating algorithm, and finally in a loopless generating algorithm.","authors":["Vincent Vajnovszki"],"meta":["January 2001","DOI:10.1007/978-1-4471-0717-0_19"],"references":["275620382_A_Handbook_of_Integer_Sequences","243784395_Generation_of_Parenthesis_Strings_by_transpositions","239065796_Combinatorial_Algorithms_An_Update","238833292_Counting_linear_extensions","238126334_Combination_generation_and_graylex_ordering","233016291_On_the_listing_and_random_generation_of_hybrid_binary_trees","229749986_Generalized_Fibonacci_cubes_are_mostly_Hamiltonian","226824491_A_loop-free_algorithm_for_generating_the_linear_extensions_of_a_poset","225904341_A_simplified_loop-free_algorithm_for_generating_permutations","223930136_On_the_loopless_generation_of_binary_tree_sequences","222376932_Generating_Multiset_Permutations_in_Constant_Time","221209536_Generating_Binary_Trees_by_Transpositions","220617374_Combinatorial_Gray_Codes","220459317_A_Binary_Tree_Representation_and_Related_Algorithms_for_Generating_Partitions","220430697_Loopless_Algorithms_for_Generating_Permutations_Combinations_and_Other_Combinatorial_Configurations","220425186_Efficient_Generation_of_the_Binary_Reflected_Gray_Code_and_Its_Applications","220406821_On_Rotations_and_the_Generation_of_Binary_Trees","220406381_Multiset_Permutations_and_Loopless_Generation_of_Ordered_Trees_with_Specified_Degree_Sequence","220406198_Generation_of_Well-Formed_Parenthesis_Strings_in_Constant_Worst-Case_Time","220114782_A_Loopless_Algorithm_for_Generating_Binary_Tree_Sequences","220114036_Loopless_Generation_of_Gray_Codes_for","220112037_Shifts_and_Loopless_Generation_of","220110653_Loopless_Generation_of_k-Ary_Tree_Sequences","3300206_Extended_Fibonacci_Cubes","3299625_Fibonacci_Cubes_A_new_interconnection_topology","2708262_Efficient_Generation_of_Subsets_with_a_Given_Sum","2515441_Gray_Codes_for_A-Free_Strings"]}
