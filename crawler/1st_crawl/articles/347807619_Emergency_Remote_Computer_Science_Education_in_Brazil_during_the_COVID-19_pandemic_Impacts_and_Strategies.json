{"id":"347807619_Emergency_Remote_Computer_Science_Education_in_Brazil_during_the_COVID-19_pandemic_Impacts_and_Strategies","abstract":"At the end of 2019, there was an outbreak of pneumonia in Chinese territory that quickly spread across the globe. Due to its infection characteristics, several face-to-face activities that brought many people together had to be rethought. In this critical scenario, teaching was abruptly changed into a modality called Emergency Remote Education (ERE). Thus, many professors had to adapt materials and resources from traditional teaching to the ERE modality without any previous planning and organization. Considering the aforementioned, the main goal of this study is to present how ERE has been conducted by professors in the field of Computer Science in Brazil. To achieve this goal, we prepared an electronic questionnaire, which was answered by 141 professors from different Brazilian educational institutions. The main results achieved by this research include the impacts observed and the strategies that have been practiced by such professionals. Based on the gathered results, we can notice that Computer Science professors in Brazil had (and still have) to reinvent themselves during ERE. In addition, there is still a lack of public previous policies to support these professionals’ routine.","authors":["William Simão de Deus","Maria Lydia Fioravanti","Camila Dias de Oliveira Sestito","Ellen Barbosa"],"meta":["December 2020Revista Brasileira de Informática na Educação 28:1032-1059","DOI:10.5753/rbie.2020.28.0.1032"],"references":["342626923_Curriculum_conceptions_of_technology_Theoretical_insights_from_National_Education_Policies_in_Brazil_Korea_and_the_United_States","341525564_Planning_and_evaluation_during_educational_disruption_lessons_learned_from_COVID-19_pandemic_for_treatment_of_emergencies_in_education","341411723_EDUCACAO_REMOTA_EMERGENCIAL_elementos_para_politicas_publicas_na_educacao_brasileira_em_tempos_de_Covid-19","339993967_Suspending_Classes_Without_Stopping_Learning_China's_Education_Emergency_Management_Policy_in_the_COVID-19_Outbreak","334483279_TLCS_A_Digital_Library_with_Resources_to_Teach_and_Learn_Computer_Science","342678555_Hybrid_Classroom_Designing_for_the_New_Normal_after_COVID-19_Pandemic","340494216_COVID-19_Outbreak_An_Overview","339516973_World_Health_Organization_declares_Global_Emergency_A_review_of_the_2019_Novel_Coronavirus_COVID-19","336660130_MoodleREC_A_recommendation_system_for_creating_courses_using_the_moodle_e-learning_platform","331607573_Students'_Perceptions_of_Applying_Real-world_Problem_Solving_in_Computer_Science_Education_Case_Study_in_Interaction_Design"]}
