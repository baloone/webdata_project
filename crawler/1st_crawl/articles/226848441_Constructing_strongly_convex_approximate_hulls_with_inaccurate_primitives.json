{"id":"226848441_Constructing_strongly_convex_approximate_hulls_with_inaccurate_primitives","abstract":"The first half of this paper introducesEpsilon Geometry, a framework for the development of robust geometric algorithms using inaccurate primitives. Epsilon Geometry is based on a very general model of imprecise computations, which includes floating-point and rounded-integer arithmetic as special cases. The second half of the paper introduces the notion of a (–)-convex polygon, a polygon that remains convex even if its vertices are all arbitrarily displaced by a distance of of less, and proves some interesting properties of such polygons. In particular, we prove that for every point set there exists a (–)-convex polygonH such that every point is at most 4 away fromH. Using the tools of Epsilon Geometry, we develop robust algorithms for testing whether a polygon is (–)-convex, for testing whether a point is inside a (–)-convex polygon, and for computing a (–)-convex approximate hull for a set of points.","authors":["Leonidas J.
