{"id":"337642905_The_effect_of_coding_courses_on_the_cognitive_abilities_and_problem-solving_skills_of_preschool_children","abstract":"Background and Context: There are studies which indicate that computer programming supports high-level abilities for everyone such as creative thinking, questioning, problem solving and critical thinking which are considered within the scope of 21st-century abilities.\nObjective: The current experimental study was carried out to put forth the impact on the problem solving and cognitive abilities of computer programming course applied on 4â€“5-year-old preschool children.\nMethod: The study was arranged according to a pretest-posttest control group experiment model.\nFindings: According to the results, there is an increase in the non-verbal cognitive abilities of children in the experiment group with no statistically significant difference in their problem-solving skills.\nImplications: Our findings give an evidence about the effects of a coding course on preschool children through the use of two validated tests for problem-solving skills and cognitive skills.","authors":["Serdar Ciftci","Ahmet Bildiren"],"meta":["January
