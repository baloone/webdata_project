{"id":"298421301_A_Model_to_Support_Monitoring_for_Classroom_Orchestration_in_a_Tablet-Based_CSCL_Activity","abstract":"The work presented in this article addresses CSCL settings in which students work with tablets in classrooms. The objective is to study how to equip teachers with tablets to monitor students' progress and intervene when required. We propose a model that provides teachers with both quantitative and qualitative run-time feedback based on the students' progress. An implementation of this model was tested in the context of an activity called negotiated dictation. The results suggest that the model and associated tools are easy for teachers to use and allow them to satisfactorily monitor the progress of both the class and individual students or groups.","authors":["Patrick Wang","Pierre Tchounikine","Matthieu Quignard"],"meta":["September 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-24258-3_45","Conference: 10th European Conference on technology-Enhanced LearningAt: Toledo","Project: Classroom Orchestration using Tablets"],"references":["298421324_Orchestration_Challenges_Raised_by_Transposing_a_Paper-Based_Individual_Activity_into_a_Tablet-Based_CSCL_Activity_An_Example","264129336_Orchestrating_technology_enhanced_learning_A_literature_review_and_a_conceptual_framework","298421128_Orchestration_Challenges_Raised_by_Transposing_a_Paper-Based_Individual_Activity_into_a_Tablet-Based_CSCL_Activity_An_Example","278718546_Computer_Science_and_Educational_Software_Design","262348675_Design_for_classroom_orchestration","262324103_Clarifying_Design_for_Orchestration_Orchestration_and_Orchestrable_Technology_Scripting_and_Conducting","262243045_Classroom_orchestration_Synthesis","262206570_UniPad_Orchestrating_collaborative_activities_through_shared_tablets_and_an_integrated_wall_display","260944699_Orchestrating_a_Multi-tabletop_Classroom_from_Activity_Design_to_Enactment_and_Reflection","222688486_Computer_supported_collaborative_learning_using_wirelessly_interconnected_mobile_computers"]}
