{"id":"228671537_The_Role_of_ontologies_in_data_integration","abstract":"In this paper, we discuss the use of ontologies for data integra-tion. We consider two different settings depending on the system architecture: central and peer-to-peer data integration. Within those settings, we discuss five different cases studies that illustrate the use of ontologies in metadata representation, in global conceptualization, in high-level querying, in declarative mediation, and in mapping support. Each case study is described in detail and accompanied by examples.","authors":["Isabel F Cruz","Huiyong Xiao","Advis Lab"],"meta":["December 2005International Journal of Engineering Intelligent Systems for Electrical Engineering and Communications 13(4)"],"references":["245250231_Algorithm_and_Tool_for_Automated_Ontology_Merging_and_Alignment","227221825_OBSERVER_An_Approach_for_Query_Processing_in_Global_Information_Systems_Based_on_Interoperation_Across_Pre-Existing_Ontologies","221606754_PROMPT_Algorithm_and_Tool_for_Automated_Ontology_Merging_and_Alignment","221268663_Querying_Heterogeneous_XML_Sources_through_a_Conceptual_Schema","220966852_PeerDB_A_P2P-based_System_for_Distributed_Data_Sharing","220473763_A_Survey_of_Approaches_to_Automatic_Schema_Matching","220416024_The_Hyperion_project_From_data_integration_to_data_coordination","220266329_Data_Integration_A_Theoretical_Perspective","200122923_Ontology-based_integration_of_information_---_a_survey_of_existing_approaches","200122911_Ontology-Based_Integration_of_XML_Web_Resources","3670082_OBSERVER_An_Approach_for_Query_Processing_in_Global_Information_Systems_Based_on_Interoperation_Across_Pre-Existing_Ontologies","2870198_Piazza_Data_Management_Infrastructure_for_Semantic_Web_Applications","2869339_Data_Management_for_Peer-to-Peer_Computing_A_Vision","2809069_The_semantic_web_the_roles_of_XML_and_RDF","2677127_Query_Processing_in_the_SIMS_Information_Mediator","244453932_An_Ontology-based_Framework_for_Semantic_Interoperability_between_XML_Sources","244437488_A_Translation_Approach_to_Portable_Ontology_Specifications","235720353_A_Translational_Approach_to_Portable_Ontologies","228974939_Semantic_Mappings_for_the_Integration_of_XML_and_RDF_Sources","228954907_RDF-based_metadata_management_in_peer-to-peer_systems","225070478_Formal_Ontology_in_Information_Systems_FOIS","222837908_Information_integration_using_logical_views","221607231_Semi-automatic_Ontology_Alignment_for_Geospatial_Data_Integration","221393690_An_Ontology_for_Engineering_Mathematics","221234733_A_Peer-to-Peer_Information_System_for_the_Semantic_Web","221234718_Peer-to-Peer_semantic_integration_of_XML_and_RDF_data_sources","220042011_Overcoming_the_semantic_and_other_barriers_to_GIS_interoperability","4049591_Using_a_layered_approach_for_interoperability_on_the_semantic_Web","3417103_Capacity_Optimization_in_Wireless_Communication_Systems_With_Mixed_Platforms"]}
