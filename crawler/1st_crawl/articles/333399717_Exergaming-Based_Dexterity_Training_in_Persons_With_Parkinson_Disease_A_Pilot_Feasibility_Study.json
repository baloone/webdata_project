{"id":"333399717_Exergaming-Based_Dexterity_Training_in_Persons_With_Parkinson_Disease_A_Pilot_Feasibility_Study","abstract":"Background and purpose: \nMany individuals with Parkinson disease (PD) suffer from impaired dexterity, which impacts activities of daily living and quality of life. Exergaming, video game-based training with augmented virtual reality, may have value for improving function. The aim of the present pilot study was to comprehensively evaluate the feasibility of a dexterity training program using exergaming, in individuals with PD.\n\nMethods: \nTen participants with PD (aged between 55 and 75 years, Hoehn and Yahr stages II-IV) trained over a period of 4 weeks, twice a week for 30 minutes. Baseline (T0) and postintervention (T1) assessments were done. Primary outcomes with respect to feasibility were the adherence rate, open-end questions, the level of participation (Pittsburgh Rehabilitation Participation Scale), and the usability (System Usability Scale). Dexterous function was measured with the Nine-Hole Peg Test and the Dexterity Questionnaire-24. Upper limb motor impairment was assessed by a modified version of the Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale III. Finally, quality of life was assessed by the 39-item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39).\n\nResults: \nAdherence rate was 99%, motivation increased significantly from 3.9 to 4.8 (Pittsburgh Rehabilitation Participation Scale, P = 0.03), and system usability of the exergaming system was acceptable to very good. Regarding potential efficacy, participants with impaired dexterity at T0 significantly improved in the Nine-Hole Peg Test and the PDQ-39.\n\nDiscussions and conclusions: \nThe outcomes of this pilot study suggest that exergaming is feasible and has potential to improve dexterity in individuals with PD. Its efficacy should be investigated in a properly powered randomized controlled trial.Video Abstract available for more insights from the authors (see Supplemental Digital Content 1, available at: http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A270).","authors":["Judith van Beek","Erwin van Wegen","Stephan Bohlhalter","Tim Vanbellingen"],"meta":["May 2019Journal of neurologic physical therapy: JNPT 43(3):1","DOI:10.1097/NPT.0000000000000278"],"references":["326656056_Leap_motion_evaluation_for_assessment_of_upper_limb_motor_skills_in_Parkinson's_disease","324466029_Effectiveness_of_Serious_Games_for_Leap_Motion_on_the_Functionality_of_the_Upper_Limb_in_Parkinson's_Disease_A_Feasibility_Study","321675263_Usability_of_Videogame-Based_Dexterity_Training_in_the_Early_Rehabilitation_Phase_of_Stroke_Patients_A_Pilot_Study","319394819_SUS_--_a_quick_and_dirty_usability_scale","318717294_Home-based_step_training_using_videogame_technology_in_people_with_Parkinson's_disease_a_single-blinded_randomised_controlled_trial","307143896_Effects_of_a_balance-based_exergaming_intervention_using_the_Kinect_sensor_on_posture_stability_in_individuals_with_Parkinson's_disease_A_single-blinded_randomized_controlled_trial","301777958_Limb-kinetic_apraxia_affects_activities_of_daily_living_in_Parkinson's_disease_A_multi-center_study","282530757_Exergaming_as_a_Viable_Therapeutic_Tool_to_Improve_Static_and_Dynamic_Balance_among_Older_Adults_and_People_with_Idiopathic_Parkinson's_Disease_A_Systematic_Review_and_Meta-Analysis","270965687_Participatory_Design_in_Parkinson's_Research_with_Focus_on_the_Symptomatic_Domains_to_be_Measured","260608750_The_role_of_exergaming_in_Parkinson's_disease_rehabilitation_A_systematic_review_of_the_evidence","236836772_Analysis_of_the_Accuracy_and_Robustness_of_the_Leap_Motion_Controller","228593520_SUS_A_quick_and_dirty_usability_scale","40869231_A_tutorial_on_pilot_studies_The_what_why_and_How","26329270_On_the_dimensionality_of_the_System_Usability_Scale_A_test_of_alternative_measurement_models","11836638_Determining_minimally_important_differences_for_the_PDQ-39_Parkinson's_disease_questionnaire","321694196_Limb_Kinetic_Apraxia_Is_an_Independent_Predictor_for_Quality_of_Life_in_Parkinson's_Disease","321580921_Use_of_a_Telehealth_System_to_Enhance_a_Home_Exercise_Program_for_a_Person_With_Parkinson_Disease_A_Case_Report","317152816_Home_based_training_for_dexterity_in_Parkinson's_disease_A_randomized_controlled_trial","316128897_Virtual_reality_for_rehabilitation_in_Parkinson's_disease","313630216_A_tutorial_on_pilot_studies_The_what_why_and_how","313461509_Effectiveness_of_exergaming_in_improving_functional_balance_fatigue_and_quality_of_life_in_Parkinson's_disease_A_pilot_randomized_controlled_trial","311821146_Virtual_reality_for_rehabilitation_in_Parkinson's_disease","308272470_Reliability_and_validity_of_a_new_dexterity_questionnaire_DextQ-24_in_Parkinson's_disease","301248647_Validation_of_the_Leap_Motion_Controller_using_markered_motion_capture_technology","288604661_Accuracy_of_clinical_diagnosis_of_idiopathic_Parkinson's_disease_A_clinico-pathological_study_of_100_cases","246019505_Determining_minimally_important_differences_for_the_PDQ39_Parkinson's_disease_questionnaire","230685144_Motor_learning_retention_and_transfer_after_virtual-reality-based_training_in_Parkinson's_disease_-_effect_of_motor_and_cognitive_demands_of_games_A_longitudinal_controlled_clinical_study","230253470_Recommendations_for_Planning_Pilot_Studies_in_Clinical_and_Translational_Research","51735970_The_9-Hole_Peg_Test_of_Upper_Extremity_Function_Average_Values_Test-Retest_Reliability_and_Factors_Contributing_to_Performance_in_People_With_Parkinson_Disease","51507602_Impaired_finger_dexterity_in_Parkinson's_disease_is_associated_with_praxis_function","51441394_Motor_learning_in_Parkinson's_disease_Limitations_and_potential_for_rehabilitation","47718039_The_MoCA_Well-suited_screen_for_cognitive_impairment_in_Parkinson_disease","23489930_Movement_Disorder_Society-Sponsored_Revision_of_the_Unified_Parkinson's_Disease_Rating_Scale_MDS-UPDRS_Scale_Presentation_and_Clinimetric_Testing_Results","9065319_Adult_Norms_for_a_Commercially_Available_Nine_Hole_Peg_Test_for_Finger_Dexterity","8669184_The_Pittsburgh_Rehabilitation_Participation_Scale_reliability_and_validity_of_a_clinician-rated_measure_of_participation_in_acute_rehabilitation","7293636_Subjective_report_versus_objective_measurement_of_activities_of_daily_living_in_Parkinson's_disease"]}
