{"id":"329723653_A_meta-heuristic_framework_based_on_clustering_and_preprocessed_datasets_for_solving_the_link_prediction_problem","abstract":"This study presents a solution to a problem commonly known as link prediction problem. Link prediction problem interests in predicting\nthe possibility of appearing a connection between two nodes of a network, while there is no connection between these nodes in the present state of the network. Finding a solution to link prediction problem attracts variety of computer science fields such as data mining and\nmachine learning. This attraction is due to its importance for many applications such as social networks, bioinformatics and co-authorship\nnetworks. Towards solving this problem, Evolutionary Link Prediction (EVO-LP) framework is proposed, presented, analysed and tested.\nEVO-LP is a framework that includes dataset preprocessing approach and a meta-heuristic algorithm based on clustering for prediction.\nEVO-LP is divided into preprocessing stage and link prediction stage. Feature extraction, data under-sampling and feature selection are utilised in the preprocessing stage, while in the prediction stage, a meta-heuristic algorithm based on clustering is used as an optimiser.\nExperimental results on a number of real networks show that EVO-LP improves the prediction quality with low time complexity","authors":["Reham Barham","Ahmad Abdel-Aziz Sharieh","Azzam Sleit"],"meta":["December 2018Journal of Information Science 45(142):016555151881629","DOI:10.1177/0165551518816296"],"references":["320556450_Link_Prediction_Based_on_Whale_Optimization_Algorithm","305851542_MODIFIED_MOTH-FLAME_OPTIMIZATION_ALGORITHMS_FOR_TERRORISM_PREDICTION","321586129_Efficient_enhancement_on_cellular_automata_for_data_mining","314620587_Applications_of_Link_Prediction","313093649_Dynamic_programming_Mineola_NY_Dover_Publications_Berkes_P_Orban_G_Lengyel_M_Fiser","312621023_Filters_Wrappers_and_a_boosting-based_hybrid_for_feature_selection","306067503_Similarity-based_link_prediction_in_social_networks_A_path_and_node_combined_approach","304744011_Vital_nodes_identification_in_complex_networks","301233236_Clustering_and_preferential_attachment_in_growing_networks","298795410_Feature_Extraction_Techniques_Fundamental_Concepts_and_Survey"]}
