{"id":"355979177_Towards_Classification_of_Interactive_Non-programming_Tasks_Promoting_Computational_Thinking","abstract":"Tasks from Bebras International Challenge on Informatics and Computational thinking are becoming a widespread educational tool for introducing students to the concepts of computer science not only in a form of a contest, but as well in computer science classrooms, games and unplugged activities. There is an ongoing debate in Bebras community about the need and the role of inter-activity in Bebras tasks. Practices in different countries range from pen-and-paper solutions to fully interactive systems with immediate feedback. This work introduces classification of Interactive Bebras tasks based on engagement and interactivity taxonomies aligned with current practices of Bebras task development. Proposed classification is then used to categorize the latest tasks from Lithuanian, French and Italian Bebras Challenges. The results from this work shed more light on the properties, potential benefits and shortcomings of non-programming interactive tasks informing future research on the topic as well as current practices of organizing International Bebras Challenge.","authors":["Tomas Å iaulys","Valentina Dagiene"],"meta":["November 2021","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-90228-5_2","Project: Classification of (Bebras) Interactive Non-Programming Tasks to Foster Computational Thinking"],"references":["350383947_Designing_Bebras_Serious_Games_Interaction_for_Indonesian_Upper_Elementary_School_Students","346710020_Engagement_Taxonomy_for_Introductory_Programming_Tools_Failing_to_Tackle_the_Problems_of_Comprehension","318317590_The_effect_of_games_and_simulations_on_higher_education_a_systematic_literature_review","347525538_Getting_Inspired_by_Bebras_Tasks_How_Italian_Teachers_Elaborate_on_Computing_Topics","347364696_Algorithm_Visualization_Environments_Degree_of_interactivity_as_an_influence_on_student-learning","345713265_Bebras_Based_Activities_for_Computer_Science_Education_Review_and_Perspectives","333346464_How_Pupils_Solve_Online_Problems_An_Analytical_View","310792069_The_long_quest_for_computational_thinking","299861897_Bebras_Informatics_Contest_Criteria_for_Good_Tasks_Revised","289821180_Extending_the_Engagement_Taxonomy","259998484_A_Review_of_Generic_Program_Visualization_Systems_for_Introductory_Programming_Education","269821128_When_does_higher_degree_of_interaction_lead_to_higher_learning_in_visualizations_Exploring_the_role_of_'Interactivity_Enriching_Features'","263488269_Sophisticated_tasks_in_e-assessment_What_are_they_and_what_are_their_benefits","254857766_Learning_and_Instruction_with_Computer_Simulations_Learning_Processes_Involved","242400296_A_Revision_of_Bloom's_Taxonomy_An_Overview"]}
