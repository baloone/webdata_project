{"id":"303345360_Handbook_of_Bibliometric_Indicators_Quantitative_Tools_for_Studying_and_Evaluating_Research","abstract":"A systematic guide to the growing jungle of citation indices and other bibliometric indicators.\nWritten with the aim of providing a complete and unbiased overview of all available statistical measures for scientific productivity, the core of this reference is an alphabetical dictionary of indices and other algorithms used to evaluate the importance and impact of researchers and their institutions. In 150 major articles, the authors describe all indices in strictly mathematical terms without passing judgement on their relative merit. From widely used measures, such as the journal impact factor or the h-index, to highly specialized indices, all indicators currently in use in the sciences and humanities are described, and their application explained.","authors":["Roberto Todeschini","Alberto Baccini"],"meta":["May 2016","DOI:10.1002/9783527681969","Edition: 2016Publisher: Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
