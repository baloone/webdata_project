{"id":"234812396_Education_Paving_the_way_for_computational_thinking","abstract":"Computing professionals and educators face the responsibility to make computation available to thinkers of all disciplines. Computing education researchers are using experimentation and design to demonstrate that important questions can address important questions about how humans come to understand computing. Computing education research draws to a variety of disciplines to make computing education better. They draw on methods from education, sociology, and psychology in order to measure learning about computing and understand the factors that influence that learning. One can broaden access to computing ideas and capabilities by making computing education better.","authors":["Mark Guzdial"],"meta":["August 2008Communications of the ACM 51(8):25-27","DOI:10.1145/1378704.1378713"],"references":["274309848_Computational_Thinking","230216438_Structuring_the_programmer's_task","228931195_Commonsense_computing_episode_3_Concurrency_and_concert_tickets","220420371_Computational_thinking","228058013_Studying_the_language_and_structure_in_non-programmers'_solutions_to_programming_problems","224102458_Natural_language_programming_Styles_strategies_and_contrasts"]}
