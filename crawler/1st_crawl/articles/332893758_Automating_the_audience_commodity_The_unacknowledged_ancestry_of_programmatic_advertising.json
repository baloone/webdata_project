{"id":"332893758_Automating_the_audience_commodity_The_unacknowledged_ancestry_of_programmatic_advertising","abstract":"Programmatic advertising describes techniques for automating and optimizing transactions in the audience marketplace. Facilitating real-time bidding for audience impressions and personalized targeting, programmatic technologies are at the leading edge of digital, data-driven advertising. But almost no research considers programmatic advertising within a general history of information technology in commercial media industries. The computerization of advertising and media buying remains curiously unexamined. Using archival sources, this study situates programmatic advertising within a longer trajectory, focusing on the incorporation of electronic data processing into the spot television business, starting in the 1950s. The article makes three contributions: it illustrates that (1) demands for information, data processing, and rapid communications have long been central to advertising and media buying; (2) automation “ad tech” developed gradually through efforts to coordinate and accelerate transactions; and (3) the use of computers to increase efficiency and approach mathematical optimization reformatted calculative resources for media and marketing decisions.","authors":["Lee McGuigan"],"meta":["May 2019New Media & Society 21(3):146144481984644","DOI:10.1177/1461444819846449"],"references":["272410424_Recommended_for_you_The_Netflix_Prize_and_the_production_of_algorithmic_culture","240729307_Technologies_Texts_and_Affordances","233012096_Algorithmic_ideology","223142590_Algorithmic_Ideology_How_Capitalist_Society_Shapes_Search_Engines","324550446_Media_as_Data_Extraction_Towards_a_New_Map_of_a_Transformed_Communications_Field","324352933_The_Ecological_Approach_to_Visual_Perception","321200244_When_Old_Technologies_Were_New","313836521_Envisioning_the_power_of_data_analytics","313467391_Communications_Blindspot_of_Western_Marxism","313311365_What_is_Media_Archaeology","290531554_Buying_Services_and_the_Media_Marketplace","290268028_The_Digital_Hand_Vol_1_How_Computers_Changed_the_Work_of_American_Manufacturing_Transportation_and_Retail_Industries","284528757_Statistical_Abstract_of_the_United_States_1984","284528208_Statistical_Abstract_of_the_United_States_1979","282420731_Algorithmic_brands_A_decade_of_brand_experiments_with_mobile_and_social_media","275061568_Big_other_Surveillance_Capitalism_and_the_Prospects_of_an_Information_Civilization","269546452_When_Old_Technologies_Were_New","262333776_Using_Technology_and_Constituting_Structures_A_Practice_Lens_for_Studying_Technology_in_Organizations","254597872_Toward_a_model_of_audience_evolution_New_technologies_and_the_transformation_of_media_audiences","248925225_Ratings_and_the_Institutional_Approach_A_Third_Answer_to_the_Commodity_Question","247734492_Peripheral_Vision","242780014_Audience_manufacture_in_historical_perspective_From_broadcasting_to_Google","242275063_And_lead_us_not_into_thinking_the_new_is_new_A_bibliographic_case_for_new_media_history","236771082_Markets_and_Machines_Work_in_the_Technological_Sensoryscapes_of_Finance","37692806_The_Conquest_of_Cool_Business_Culture_Counterculture_and_the_Rise_of_Hip_Consumerism","31776289_The_Conquest_of_Cool_Business_Culture_Counterculture_and_the_Rise_of_Hip_Consumerism_T_Frank"]}
