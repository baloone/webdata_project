{"id":"323992471_HOME_Hybrid_Ontology_Mapping_Evaluation_Tool_for_Computer_Science_Curricula","abstract":"This paper presents a hybrid ontology mapping tool for evaluating the standard of computer science subjects against the Thailand Qualification Framework for Higher Education (HQF: HEd). This can improve the standard of curriculum of universities in Thailand with higher accuracy and enable the decrease of processing time. Three ontologies have been designed: course, TQF: HEd and the standard curriculum of computer science. They were used for comparing course contents by applying a combination of ontology mapping techniques (semantic-based using extended Wu & Palmer's algorithm and structure-based using SKOS features). Test with the sample data show that the tool based on a hybrid ontology mapping worked sufficiently well and can inform the efforts for curriculum improvement.","authors":["Chayan Nuntawong","Chakkrit Snae","Michael Br√ºckner"],"meta":["March 2018"],"references":["272787843_A_Semantic_Similarity_Assessment_Tool_for_Computer_Science_Subjects_Using_Extended_Wu_Palmer's_Algorithm_and_Ontology"]}
