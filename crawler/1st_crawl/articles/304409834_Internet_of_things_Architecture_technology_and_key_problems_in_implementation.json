This paper presents a study by first introducing the basic concepts and features of Internet of Things (IoT) followed by the introduction of the ubiquitous sensor networks (USN) architecture. A simplified model of the USN is also discussed. Furthermore, the key problems in the implementation of IoT are also discussed using the system model. Finally, two practical system model are designed on sensing layer based on ARM9 acquisition and transmission system.","authors":["Zhijia Yue","Wanrong Sun","Peijia Li","Masood Ur Rehman"],"meta":["October 2015","DOI:10.1109/CISP.2015.7408082","Conference: 2015 8th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing (CISP)"],"references":["319393385_Towards_the_Web_of_Things_Web_Mashups_for_Embedded_Devices","273394797_Cost_Minimization_for_Big_Data_Processing_in_Geo-Distributed_Data_Centers","259922825_Semantics_for_the_Internet_of_Things_Early_Progress_and_Back_to_the_Future","228355654_Architecting_a_mashable_open_world_wide_web_of_things","51890865_Internet_of_Things_Applications_and_Challenges_in_Technology_and_Standardization","4305130_Infrastructure_for_Data_Processing_in_Large-Scale_Interconnected_Sensor_Networks","220619414_Real-time_Ethernet_networks_for_motion_control","4339941_Robust_De-anonymization_of_Large_Sparse_Datasets","3338919_SenseWeb_An_Infrastructure_for_Shared_Sensing"]}
