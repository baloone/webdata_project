{"id":"301573495_An_Efficient_Virtualization_Server_Infrastructure_for_e-Schools_of_India","abstract":"According to 2011 census, the literacy rate in India is 74.04 %, a substantial increase when compared to that of 65.38 % in 2001 but it is a way below than the average world literacy rate of 84 %. Out of 177 countries covered as per Human Development Report, India ranks 126 among the in the literacy rate (http:// www. rediff. com/ news/ 2007/ nov/ 20illi. htm [1]). Since 90 % schools are located in rural areas, Rural education in India is to given utmost importance. Access to quality education is far behind in rural areas since there are fewer committed teachers because the qualification and source of income for the teachers are very less than what it is expected to be. Since there is an upward trend in growth of rural Internet access, creating rural specific applications enable immense growth of rural India. So using the World Wide Web as Education delivery medium would be the legitimate solution as it can not only eliminate most of the issues in rural education but also disseminate the best quality education. This paper provides a novel solution through implementation of e-school by using concept of virtualization. Server virtualization is the cost-effective implementation with least server consolidation.","authors":["Gantasala Sai Hemanth","Noor Mahammad"],"meta":["January 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-81-322-2752-6_8","In book: Information Systems Design and Intelligent Applications (pp.89-99)"],"references":["238109224_FlowVisor_A_Network_Virtualization_Layer","233779932_E-Learning_online_learning_and_distance_learning_environments_Are_they_the_same"]}
