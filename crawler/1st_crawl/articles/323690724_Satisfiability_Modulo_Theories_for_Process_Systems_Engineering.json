{"id":"323690724_Satisfiability_Modulo_Theories_for_Process_Systems_Engineering","abstract":"Process systems engineers have long recognized the importance of both logic and optimization for automated decision-making. But modern challenges in process systems engineering could strongly benefit from methodological contributions in computer science. In particular, we propose satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) for process systems engineering applications. We motivate SMT using a series of test beds and show the applicability of SMT algorithms and implementations on (i) two-dimensional bin packing, (ii) model explainers, and (iii) mixed-integer nonlinear optimization solvers.","authors":["Miten Mistry","Andrea Callia D'Iddio","Michael Huth","Ruth Misener"],"meta":["March 2018Computers & Chemical Engineering 113","DOI:10.1016/j.compchemeng.2018.03.004"],"references":["329691575_OptiMathSAT_A_Tool_for_Optimization_Modulo_Theories","313394721_Manyopt_An_Extensible_Tool_for_Mixed_Non-Linear_Optimization_Through_SMT_Solving","287497316_Global_Optimization_Advances_in_Mixed-Integer_Nonlinear_Programming_MINLP_and_Constrained_Derivative-Free_Optimization_CDFO","279541652_A_hybrid_CPMP_approach_to_supply_chain_modelling_optimization_and_analysis","318715480_Pseudo_basic_steps_bound_improvement_guarantees_from_Lagrangian_decomposition_in_convex_disjunctive_programming","312533063_Scheduling_projects_with_multi-skilled_personnel_by_a_hybrid_milpcp_benders_decomposition_algorithm","310036014_Confidence_Analysis_for_Nuclear_Arms_Control_SMT_Abstractions_of_Bayesian_Belief_Networks","302552868_Nonlinear_and_Mixed-Integer_Optimization_Fundamentals_and_Applications","295258762_Cutting_Plane_Algorithm_for_Convex_Generalized_Disjunctive_Programs","273001565_Disjunctive_Programming"]}
