{"id":"313575668_Statistical_and_structural_approaches_to_texture","abstract":"In this survey we review the image processing literature on the various approaches and models investigators have used for texture. These include statistical approaches of autocorrelation functions, optical transforms, digital transforms, textural edgeness, structural element, gray tone co-occurrence, run lengths, and autoregressive models. We discuss and generalize some structural approaches to texture based on more complex primitives than gray tone. We conclude with some structural-statistical generalizations which apply the statistical techniques to the structural primitives. -Author","authors":["Robert Martin Haralick"],"meta":["January 2005"],"references":["303604832_Measuring_the_shape_of_geographical_phenomena_A_history_of_the_issue","290828549_The_Leitz_texture_analyzes_systems","284420885_Image_segmentation_using_texture_and_gray_level","284114607_Automatic_analysis_of_cell_images"]}
