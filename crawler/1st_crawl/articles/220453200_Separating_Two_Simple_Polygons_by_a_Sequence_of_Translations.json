{"id":"220453200_Separating_Two_Simple_Polygons_by_a_Sequence_of_Translations","abstract":"LetP andQ be two disjoint simple polygons havingm andn sides, respectively. We present an algorithm which determines whetherQ can be moved by a sequence of translations to a position sufficiently far fromP without colliding withP, and which produces such a motion if it exists. Our algorithm runs in timeO(mnα(mn) logm logn) where α(k) is the extremely slowly growing inverse Ackermann's function. Since in the worst case Ω(mn) translations may be necessary to separateQ fromP, our algorithm is close to optimal.","authors":["PSS] R.
