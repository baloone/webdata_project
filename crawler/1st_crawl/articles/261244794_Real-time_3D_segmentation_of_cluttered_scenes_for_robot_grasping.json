{"id":"261244794_Real-time_3D_segmentation_of_cluttered_scenes_for_robot_grasping","abstract":"We present a real-time algorithm that segments unstructured and highly cluttered scenes. The algorithm robustly separates objects of unknown shape in congested scenes of stacked and partially occluded objects. The model-free approach finds smooth surface patches, using a depth image from a Kinect camera, which are subsequently combined to form highly probable object hypotheses. The real-time capabilities and the quality of the algorithm are evaluated on a benchmark database. Advantages compared to existing approaches as well as weaknesses are discussed. We also report on an autonomous grasping experiment with the Shadow Robot Hand which employs the estimated shape and pose of objects given by our algorithm in a task in which it cleans a table.","authors":["Andre Uckermann","Robert Haschke","Helge Ritter"],"meta":["November 2012","DOI:10.1109/HUMANOIDS.2012.6651520","Conference: Humanoid Robots (Humanoids), 2012 12th IEEE-RAS International Conference on"],"references":["261353757_3D_scene_segmentation_for_autonomous_robot_grasping","260317575_Point_Cloud_Segmentation_via_Constrained_Nonlinear_Least_Squares_Surface_Normal_Estimates","228864936_Real-Time_Plane_Segmentation_using_RGB-D_Cameras","228340970_Segmentation_of_point_clouds_using_smoothness_constraint","224567964_An_automatic_grasp_planning_system_for_service_robots","224567963_6D_object_localization_and_obstacle_detection_for_collision-free_manipulation_with_a_mobile_service_robot","224199777_General_3D_modelling_of_novel_objects_from_a_single_view","221305341_Depth-Encoded_Hough_Voting_for_Joint_Object_Detection_and_Shape_Recovery","221074989_Mind_the_gap_-_Robotic_grasping_under_incomplete_observation","221068443_3D_is_here_Point_cloud_library_PCL","221064696_Close-range_Scene_Segmentation_and_Reconstruction_of_3D_Point_Cloud_Maps_for_Mobile_Manipulation_in_Domestic_Environments","220122577_The_MOPED_framework_Object_recognition_and_pose_estimation_for_manipulation","4297047_Platform_portable_anthropomorphic_grasping_with_the_bielefeld_20-DOF_shadow_and_9-DOF_TUM_hand","224211488_Object_segmentation_and_learning_through_feature_grouping_and_manipulation","221067274_3D_object_recognition_in_range_images_using_visibility_context","221064863_Fast_3D_recognition_and_pose_using_the_Viewpoint_Feature_Histogram","215458581_Random_Sample_Consensus_A_Paradigm_for_Model_Fitting_with_Applications_To_Image_Analysis_and_Automated_Cartography","30767655_Superquadrics_and_Angle-Preserving_Transformations","3209418_Superquadrics_and_Angle-Preserving_Transformations"]}
