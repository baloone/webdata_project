{"id":"290878078_Time-Table_Extended-Edge-Finding_for_the_Cumulative_Constraint","abstract":"We propose a new filtering algorithm for the cumulative constraint. It applies the Edge-Finding, the Extended-Edge-Finding and the Time-Tabling rules in O(k\nnlogn) where k is the number of distinct task heights. By a proper use of tasks decomposition, it enforces the Time-Tabling rule and the Time-Table Extended-Edge-Finding rule. Thus our algorithm improves upon the best known Extended-Edge-Finding propagator by a factor of O(logn) while achieving a much stronger filtering.","authors":["Pierre Ouellet","Claude-Guy Quimper"],"meta":["September 2013","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-40627-0_42","Conference: International Conference on Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming"],"references":["281108386_A_Quadratic_Edge-Finding_Algorithm_for_Cumulative_Resource_Constraints","281108192_A_quadratic_edge-finding_filtering_algorithm_for_cumulative_resource_constraints","239872769_Edge_Finding_Filtering_Algorithm_for_Discrete_Cumulative_Resources_in_Okn_log_nmathcal_Okn_rm_log_n","221353628_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","221353525_Max_Energy_Filtering_Algorithm_for_Discrete_Cumulative_Resources","221353474_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","220669417_Edge_Finding_for_Cumulative_Scheduling","281724302_Extending_CHIP_in_order_to_Solve_Complex_Scheduling_and_Placement_Problems","280851930_A_Scalable_Sweep_Algorithm_for_the_cumulative_Constraint","278665666_A_New_mathcal_On2log_n_Not-FirstNot-Last_Pruning_Algorithm_for_Cumulative_Resource_Constraints","266861783_Filtering_algorithms_for_the_unary_resource_constraint","263589015_PSPLIB_--_A_project_scheduling_problem_library","248090775_Time_and_Resource_Constrained_Scheduling","230672474_Explaining_Time-Table-Edge-Finding_Propagation_for_the_CumulativeResource_Constraint","230668955_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","226201864_New_filtering_for_the_cumulative_constraint_in_the_context_of_non-overlapping_rectangles","222923415_Beldiceanu_N_Extending_CHIP_in_order_to_solve_complex_scheduling_and_placement_problems_Math_Comput_Model_177_57-73","221632966_Edge_Finding_Filtering_Algorithm_for_Discrete_Cumulative_Resources_in","221353625_New_Filtering_for_the_cumulative_Constraint_in_the_Context_of_Non-Overlapping_Rectangles","220838129_Constraint_Propagation_Techniques_for_Disjunctive_Scheduling_The_Preemptive_Case","2407873_A_New_Multi-Resource_cumulatives_Constraint_with_Negative_Heights"]}
