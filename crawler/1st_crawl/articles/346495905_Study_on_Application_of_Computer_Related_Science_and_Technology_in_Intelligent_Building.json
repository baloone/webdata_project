{"id":"346495905_Study_on_Application_of_Computer_Related_Science_and_Technology_in_Intelligent_Building","abstract":"In the field of construction engineering, computer technology has been applied to engineering design, construction, material test detection, economic accounting, project management, etc., which can effectively coordinate the development of various work. Through computer related science, construction engineering can better collect construction unit information, process engineering data, control construction materials, which will improve the management level and save costs. Therefore, the progress of computer information technology has brought new development direction to Chinaâ€™s construction industry, especially intelligent building. The application of computer technology in intelligent building meets the requirements of social progress, which can not only effectively save the construction cost, but also accelerate the process of intelligent building. By improving the quality of the overall intelligent building, we can enhance the economic benefits of intelligent construction enterprises. Through computer information technology, we can realize the intelligent, automatic and other multi-functional system installation of buildings, which is the main embodiment of intelligent buildings. The application of computer science and technology in intelligent building is in line with the development of economy and times of modern engineering construction. First of all, this paper analyzes the necessity of computer technology. Then, this paper puts forward the application of computer in intelligent building.","authors":["Xing Song","Yanqing Yang"],"meta":["October 2020Journal of Physics Conference Series 1648(3):032122","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/1648/3/032122"],"references":[]}
