{"id":"350730996_Parameter_estimation_from_ICC_curves","abstract":"Incidence vs. Cumulative Cases (ICC) curves are introduced and shown to provide a simple framework for parameter identification in the case of the most elementary epidemiological model, consisting of susceptible, infected, and removed compartments. This novel methodology is used to estimate the basic reproduction ratio of recent outbreaks, including those associated with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","authors":["Joceline Lega"],"meta":["December 2021Journal of Biological Dynamics 15(1):195-212","DOI:10.1080/17513758.2021.1912419"],"references":["339850601_Why_Is_It_Difficult_to_Accurately_Predict_the_COVID-19_Epidemic","336246422_Introduction_to_particle_Markov-chain_Monte_Carlo_for_disease_dynamics_modellers","330371506_Assessing_parameter_identifiability_in_compartmental_dynamic_models_using_a_computational_approach_application_to_infectious_disease_transmission_models","319106407_Fitting_dynamic_models_to_epidemic_outbreaks_with_quantified_uncertainty_A_Primer_for_parameter_uncertainty_identifiability_and_forecasts","309184895_Data-driven_outbreak_forecasting_with_a_simple_nonlinear_growth_model","269117056_Avoidable_errors_in_the_modeling_of_outbreaks_of_emerging_pathogens_with_special_reference_to_Ebola","338958716_Nowcasting_and_forecasting_the_potential_domestic_and_international_spread_of_the_2019-nCoV_outbreak_originating_in_Wuhan_China_a_modelling_study","323426138_Structural_and_Practical_Identifiability_Analysis_of_Outbreak_Models","271832776_Reproduction_Numbers_and_Sub-threshold_Endemic_Equilibria_for_Compartmental_Models_of_Disease_Transmission","259345679_The_Mathematics_of_Infectious_Diseases"]}
