{"id":"317826383_Simulation_of_the_Supply_of_Workplaces_by_the_AGV_in_the_Digital_Factory","abstract":"Industry 4.0 philosophy and the associated method of digital factory require a wide range of tasks and skills to be managed for their successful application and efficient operating. One of the key competencies for their reliable operation is mastering computer simulation of various logistics processes that take place within the enterprise. Among the most important logistics activities in any enterprise belongs the supply process. Currently, there is a major trend in the supply process to use the various automated systems, such as AGV. The paper further describes the process of creating a simulation model of the supply process using the method of additional programming to the needs of implementing various analyses.","authors":["Hana Neradilova","Gabriel Fedorko"],"meta":["December 2017Procedia Engineering 192:638-643","DOI:10.1016/j.proeng.2017.06.110"],"references":["289178203_Use_of_simulation_to_reduction_of_faulty_products","285904655_On-line_compositional_controller_synthesis_for_AGV","284209050_Inland_Intermodal_Terminals_Location_Criteria_Evaluation_The_Case_of_Croatia","276428908_Identifyingy_the_Utility_Function_of_Transport_Services_From_Stated_Preferences","260156817_Assessing_the_trade-off_between_lean_and_resilience_through_supply_chain_risk_management","226521980_Inventory_based_Dispatching_of_Automated_Guided_Vehicles_on_Container_Terminals","303948510_An_Active_RFID_Tag-Enabled_Locating_Approach_With_Multipath_Effect_Elimination_in_AGV","301724278_Multi_agv_scheduling_problem_in_automated_container_terminal"]}
