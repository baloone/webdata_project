{"id":"338057808_Artificial_Intelligence_AI_applications_in_Dentistry","abstract":"In the last few years, dental professionals are using different\ntechnologies to achieve a higher level of efficiency and provide better\npatient care. Advanced information technology tools have the\npotential to solve complex problems where decision making and\npredictive analysis is required. Artificial intelligence (AI) helps to\nreduce procedure time, cost, and errors. This technology has great\npotential to support the dental profession for radiographic interpretations,\ndiagnosis of orofacial pain, and analysis of facial growth\nin orthodontia and many more. Artificial Intelligence provides a machine/system with enough\nintelligence to perform, validate, evaluate, predict, analyze, with\nmarginal accuracy in a predefined environment (might or might\nnot be limited) to the preferred domain. This technology takes action\nto achieve the desired goals/solve the problem. Machines are\nmade capable of understanding human speech, data to increase efficiency. in different fields, and situations by simulating n no's of\nscenarios using complex algorithms. AI helps reduction in errors\nin making decisions. AI is classified into three different types of systems.\nFirst one is the analytical system which can inform the future\ndecision based on experience. The second type of system is human\ninspired having emotional intelligence which can easily understand\nhuman emotions and help to make the appropriate decision making.\nThe third one is the humanized AI which provides self-aware\ninteractions with others. This technology is used in different fields\nof engineering, computer science, psychology, information, philosophy,\nlinguistics, and other fields.","authors":["Abid Haleem","Mohd Javaid","Ibrahim Haleem Khan"],"meta":["December 2019Current Medicine Research and Practice 10(1)","DOI:10.1016/j.cmrp.2019.12.002","Project: publication"],"references":["333774073_Artificial_Intelligence_AI_applications_in_orthopaedics_An_innovative_technology_to_embrace","332536137_Industry_40_applications_in_medical_field_A_brief_review","330013707_Artificial_intelligence_in_dentistry","324887929_Artificial_Intelligence_Transforming_Dentistry_Today"]}
