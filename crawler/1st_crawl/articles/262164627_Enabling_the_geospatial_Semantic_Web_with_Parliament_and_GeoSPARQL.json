{"id":"262164627_Enabling_the_geospatial_Semantic_Web_with_Parliament_and_GeoSPARQL","abstract":"As the amount of Linked Open Data on the web increases, so does the amount of data with an inherent spatial context. Without spatial reasoning, however, the value of this spatial context is limited. Over the past decade there have been several vocabularies and query languages that attempt to exploit this knowledge and enable spatial reasoning. These attempts provide varying levels of support for fundamental geospatial concepts. GeoSPARQL, a forthcoming OGC standard, attempts to unify data access for the geospatial Semantic Web. As authors of the Parliament triple store and contributors to the GeoSPARQL specification, we are particularly interested in the issues of geospatial data access and indexing. In this paper, we look at the overall state of geospatial data in the Semantic Web, with a focus on GeoSPARQL. We first describe the motivation for GeoSPARQL, then the current state of the art in industry and research, followed by an example use case, and finally our implementation of GeoSPARQL in the Parliament triple store.","authors":["Robert Battle","Dave Kolas"],"meta":["October 2012Semantic Web 3(4):355-370","DOI:10.3233/SW-2012-0065"],"references":["262599397_Linked_Data_The_Story_so_Far","228910462_Efficient_Linked-List_RDF_Indexing_in_Parliament","221589711_Deep_integration_of_spatial_query_processing_into_native_RDF_triple_stores","221466269_LinkedGeoData_Adding_a_Spatial_Dimension_to_the_Web_of_Data","221393453_A_Spatial_Logic_based_on_Regions_and_Connection","221213205_R_Trees_A_Dynamic_Index_Structure_for_Spatial_Searching","220854005_Modeling_and_Querying_Metadata_in_the_Semantic_Sensor_Web_The_Model_stRDF_and_the_Query_Language_stSPARQL","220791714_A_Formal_Definition_of_Binary_Topological_Relationships","3296409_Spatial_SQL_A_query_and_presentation_language","2925800_Toward_the_Semantic_Geospatial_Web","307855204_An_Introduction_to_GeoRSS_A_Standards_Based_Approach_for_Geo-enabling_RSS_feeds","289659538_Hexastore","252331204_Spatial_information_semantic_query_based_on_SPARQL","227960649_Supporting_spatial_semantics_with_SPARQL","224285663_Allen_JF_Maintaining_Knowledge_About_Temporal_Intervals_Communications_of_the_ACM_26_832-843","222705922_DBpedia_-_A_Crystallization_Point_for_the_Web_of_Data","221218440_Combining_OWL_with_RCC_for_Spatioterminological_Reasoning_on_Environmental_Data","221104401_Linking_Open_Spatiotemporal_Data_in_the_Data_Clouds","220697663_Geo-spatial_query_based_on_extended_SPARQL","220538835_Hexastore_Sextuple_Indexing_for_Semantic_Web_Data_Management","220291238_Exploring_the_Geospatial_Semantic_Web_with_DBpedia_Mobile","2420887_Manipulating_Spatial_Data_in_Constraint_Databases"]}
