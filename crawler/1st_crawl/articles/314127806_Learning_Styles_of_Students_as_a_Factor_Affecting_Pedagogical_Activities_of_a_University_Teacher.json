{"id":"314127806_Learning_Styles_of_Students_as_a_Factor_Affecting_Pedagogical_Activities_of_a_University_Teacher","abstract":"Social changes demand a continuously increasing level of population erudition, which is to be helped by an increased quality of university education. University graduation poses a demanding study activity for students, which requires self-regulation mechanisms, attention and effective curriculum processing. University teacher can help effective learning by respecting the learning styles of students, which are closely connected to their type of thinking. Some experts [1] assume that study texts should be created in a way to reflect the type of thinking of students; i.e. serial thinking students require a differently structured study text as opposed to holistic thinking students. In this research, using the eye-tracking technology, we examined whether technically oriented students use serial thinking for acquiring and processing information and for the following problem-solving and whether humane education students use holistic thinking.","authors":["Martin Malčík","Miroslava Miklosikova"],"meta":["February 2017International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning (iJET) 12(02):210","DOI:10.3991/ijet.v12i02.6277"],"references":["259562430_USING_THE_PHYSIC_OF_NOTATION_TO_ANALYSE_MODELBUILDER_DIAGRAMS","229755880_Styles_and_Strategies_of_Learning"]}
