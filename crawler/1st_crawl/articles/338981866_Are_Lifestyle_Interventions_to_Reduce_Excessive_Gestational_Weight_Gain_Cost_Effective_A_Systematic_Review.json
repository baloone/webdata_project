{"id":"338981866_Are_Lifestyle_Interventions_to_Reduce_Excessive_Gestational_Weight_Gain_Cost_Effective_A_Systematic_Review","abstract":"Purpose of review: \nLifestyle interventions (such as diet and physical activity) successfully limit excessive gestational weight gain and can reduce some adverse maternal events; however, benefit is variable and cost-effectiveness remains unclear. We aimed to review published cost-effectiveness analyses of lifestyle interventions compared with usual care on clinically relevant outcome measures. Five international and six grey-literature databases were searched from 2007 to 2018. Articles were assessed for quality of reporting. Data were extracted from healthcare and societal perspectives. Costs were adapted to the common currencies of Australia and the United Kingdom by adjusting for resource utilization, healthcare purchase price and changes in costs over time. Included studies were economic analyses of lifestyle interventions aiming to limit weight-gain during pregnancy and/or reduce risk of gestational diabetes, for women with a BMI of 25 or greater in pre- or early-pregnancy.\n\nRecent findings: \nOf the 538 articles identified, six were retained for review: one modelling study and five studies in which an economic analysis was performed alongside a randomized-controlled trial. Outcome measures included infant birth-weight, fasting glucose, insulin resistance, gestational weight-gain, infant respiratory distress syndrome, perceived health, cost per case of adverse outcome avoided and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Interventions were cost-effective in only one study. Although many studies have investigated the efficacy of lifestyle interventions in pregnancy, few have included cost-effectiveness analyses. Where cost-effectiveness studies were undertaken, results were inconsistent. Secondary meta-analysis, taxonomy and framework research is now required to determine the effective components of lifestyle interventions and to guide future cost-effectiveness analyses.","authors":["Cate Bailey","Helen Skouteris","Helena Teede","Briony Hill"],"meta":["February 2020Current Diabetes Reports 20(2)","DOI:10.1007/s11892-020-1288-1","Project: HIPPP Health Economics"],"references":["327889866_Obesity_and_Weight_Gain_in_Pregnancy_and_Postpartum_an_Evidence_Review_of_Lifestyle_Interventions_to_Inform_Maternal_and_Child_Health_Policies","327735488_Cost-effectiveness_of_controlling_gestational_diabetes_mellitus_a_systematic_review","326575389_Attenuating_Pregnancy_Weight_Gain-What_Works_and_Why_A_Systematic_Review_and_Meta-Analysis","325743508_Adaptation_of_cost-effectiveness_analyses_to_a_single_country_The_case_of_bariatric_surgery_for_obesity_and_overweight","323766613_Cost-effectiveness_of_healthy_eating_andor_physical_activity_promotion_in_pregnant_women_at_increased_risk_of_gestational_diabetes_mellitus_Economic_evaluation_alongside_the_DALI_study_a_European_mult","323266000_Population_attributable_fractions_of_perinatal_outcomes_for_nulliparous_women_associated_with_overweight_and_obesity_1990-2014","322006282_Estimating_the_Reference_Incremental_Cost-Effectiveness_Ratio_for_the_Australian_Health_System","320174148_Epistemonikos","319047106_Effects_of_antenatal_diet_and_physical_activity_on_maternal_and_fetal_outcomes_Individual_patient_data_meta-analysis_and_health_economic_evaluation","319697131_Effectiveness_of_SmartMoms_a_Novel_eHealth_Intervention_for_Management_of_Gestational_Weight_Gain_Randomized_Controlled_Pilot_Trial","318948617_Effect_of_diet_and_physical_activity_based_interventions_in_pregnancy_on_gestational_weight_gain_and_pregnancy_outcomes_meta-analysis_of_individual_participant_data_from_randomised_trials","317865099_Improving_pregnancy_outcome_in_obese_women_the_UK_Pregnancies_Better_Eating_and_Activity_randomised_controlled_Trial","317622547_Preventing_obesity_across_the_preconception_pregnancy_and_postpartum_cycle_Implementing_research_into_practice","317372541_Association_of_Gestational_Weight_Gain_With_Maternal_and_Infant_Outcomes_A_Systematic_Review_and_Meta-analysis","317189515_Electronic-based_lifestyle_interventions_in_overweight_or_obese_perinatal_women_A_systematic_review_and_meta-analysis"]}
