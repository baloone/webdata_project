{"id":"220017507_Paper-based_versus_computer-based_assessment_Key_factors_associated_with_the_test_mode_effect","abstract":"This investigation seeks to confirm several key factors in computer-based versus paper-based assessment. Based on earlier research, the factors considered here include content familiarity, computer familiarity, competitiveness, and gender. Following classroom instruction, freshman business undergraduates (N = 105) were randomly assigned to either a computer-based or identical paper-based test. ANOVA of test data showed that the computer-based test group outperformed the paper-based test group. Gender, competitiveness, and computer familiarity were NOT related to this performance difference, though content familiarity was. Higher-attaining students benefited most from computer-based assessment relative to higher-attaining students under paper-based testing. With the current increase in computer-based assessment, instructors and institutions must be aware of and plan for possible test mode effects.","authors":["Roy Clariana","Patricia Wallace"],"meta":["November 2002British Journal of Educational Technology 33:593-602","DOI:10.1111/1467-8535.00294"],"references":["232485286_Equivalence_of_Computerized_and_Paper-and-Pencil_Cognitive_Ability_Tests_A_Meta-Analysis","225167506_Media_will_never_influence_learning","44160134_Relationships_between_charcoal_particles_in_air_and_sediments_in_West-central_Siberia","2366086_Achievement_Predictors_for_a_Computer-Applications_Module_Delivered_Online","298934457_An_Examination_of_the_Equivalence_between_Non-Adaptive_Computer-Based_and_Traditional_Testing","271698989_Comparability_of_Computer_and_Paper-and-Pencil_Scores_for_Two_CLEPR_General_Examinations","247728080_The_Effect_of_Altering_the_Position_of_Options_in_a_Multiple-Choice_Examination","242526732_What_Did_I_Just_Say_Reading_problems_in_writing_with_the_machine","235196663_Computer-Based_and_Paper-Based_Measurement_of_Recognition_Performance","234766189_Comparability_of_Computer_and_Paper-and-Pencil_Scores_for_Two_CLEP_General_Examinations_College_Board_Report_No_91-5","234727438_The_Effect_of_Changes_in_the_National_Assessment_Disentangling_the_NAEP_1985-86_Reading_Anomaly_Revised","234721353_The_Role_of_Effort_after_Meaning_and_Click_of_Comprehension_in_Recall_of_Sentences_Final_Report","234601277_Computer_Testing_versus_Paper-and-Pencil_Testing_An_Analysis_of_Examinee_Characteristics_Associated_with_Mode_Effect","232460467_The_four_generations_of_computerized_educational_measurement","229847369_Considering_learning_style_in_computer-assisted_learning","229621370_Key_factors_affecting_conceptual_gains_from_CAL_material","226841774_Gender_Differences_in_Introductory_Atmospheric_and_Oceanic_Science_Exams_Multiple_Choice_Versus_Constructed_Response_Questions","223362044_Levels_of_processing_versus_transfer_appropriate_processing","15878599_Visual_Fatigue_and_Cathode_Ray_Tube_Display_Terminals","12298481_Equivalency_of_computer-based_and_paper-and-pencil_testing"]}
