{"id":"320977725_NCCN_Guidelines_Insights_Non-Small_Cell_Lung_Cancer_Version_42016","abstract":"These NCCN Guidelines Insights focus on recent updates in the 2016 NCCN Guidelines for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC; Versions 1-4). These NCCN Guidelines Insights will discuss new immunotherapeutic agents, such as nivolumab and pembrolizumab, for patients with metastatic NSCLC. For the 2016 update, the NCCN panel recommends immune checkpoint inhibitors as preferred agents (in the absence of contraindications) for second-line and beyond (subsequent) therapy in patients with metastatic NSCLC (both squamous and nonsquamous histologies). Nivolumab and pembrolizumab are preferred based on improved overall survival rates, higher response rates, longer duration of response, and fewer adverse events when compared with docetaxel therapy.","authors":["David S Ettinger","Douglas E Wood","Wallace Akerley","Lyudmila A Bazhenova"],"meta":["March 2016Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network: JNCCN 14(3):255-64","DOI:10.6004/jnccn.2016.0031"],"references":["283242474_Metastatic_squamous_cell_non-small-cell_lung_cancer_NSCLC_Disrupting_the_drug_treatment_paradigm_with_immunotherapies","283078417_Advances_in_immunotherapy_for_treatment_of_lung_cancer","303169120_Atezolizumab_monotherapy_vs_docetaxel_in_2L3L_non-small_cell_lung_cancer_primary_analyses_for_efficacy_safety_and_predictive_biomarkers_from_a_randomized_phase_II_study_POPLAR","303103824_Nivolumab_versus_Docetaxel_in_Advanced_Squamous-Cell_Non-Small-Cell_Lung_Cancer","293638001_16LBA_Phase_II_single-arm_trial_BIRCH_of_atezolizumab_as_first-line_or_subsequent_therapy_for_locally_advanced_or_metastatic_PD-L1-selected_non-small_cell_lung_cancer_NSCLC","287505140_Pembrolizumab_versus_docetaxel_for_previously_treated_PD-L1-positive_advanced_non-small-cell_lung_cancer_KEYNOTE-010_A_randomised_controlled_trial","282347984_Anti_PD-1_and_PDL-1_Immunotherapy_in_the_Treatment_of_Advanced_Non-_Small_Cell_Lung_Cancer_NSCLC_A_Review_on_Toxicity_Profile_and_its_Management","282219764_Nivolumab_versus_Docetaxel_in_Advanced_Nonsquamous_Non-Small-Cell_Lung_Cancer","281621986_Releasing_the_Brakes_on_Cancer_Immunotherapy","280967379_Pseudoprogression_and_Immune-Related_Response_in_Solid_Tumors"]}
