{"id":"256158111_Universal_cycles_of_k-subsets_and_k-permutations","abstract":"In this paper the author constructs universal cycles of 3-subsets of an n-set for n⩾8 and (n, 3) = 1, verifying a conjecture of Chung et al. (1989) for 3-subsets. Universal cycles of 4-subsets of an n-set for n⩾8 and (n, 4) = 1 are also constructed, partially solving the same conjecture for 4-subsets. Universal cycles of k-permutations are constructed for any k⩾3 and n⩾k+1.","authors":["Brad Jackson"],"meta":["July 1993Discrete Mathematics 117(s 1–3):141–150","DOI:10.1016/0012-365X(93)90330-V","SourceDBLP"],"references":["271512783_Graph_Theory_and_Applications","267008664_Graph_Theory_With_Application","220192621_Universal_Cycles_for_Combinatorial_Structures"]}
