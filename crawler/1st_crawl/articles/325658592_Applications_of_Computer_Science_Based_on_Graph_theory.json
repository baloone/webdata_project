{"id":"325658592_Applications_of_Computer_Science_Based_on_Graph_theory","abstract":"The field of mathematics plays an essential role in different domains. In various areas of graph theory is employed in several applications of technology. Graphs are considered as an outstanding modeling tool which is utilized to model several classes of relations amongst any physical scenario. Several issues of the real world can be represented by graphs. This paper explores varied ideas concerned in graph theory and their applications in computer science to demonstrate the utilization of graph theory. These applications are given particularly to project the thought of graph theory and to demonstrate its objective and importance in computer science engineering.","authors":["Dakineni Durgaprasad","Mesdisetti Snehadivya","Muttipati Appala Srinuvasu"],"meta":["December 2017"],"references":["332012041_APPLICATIONS_OF_GRAPH_THEORY_IN_COMPUTER_SCIENCE_AN_OVERVIEW","305986291_Class-Oriented_Model_Graph_Design_Based_on_Abstract_Syntax_Tree","302578687_Application_of_Graph_Theory_in_an_Intelligent_Tutoring_System_for_Solving_Mathematical_Word_Problems","269669347_Graph_based_Representation_and_Analysis_of_Text_Document_A_Survey_of_Techniques","228745380_Concepts_of_Graph_Theory_Relevant_to_Ad-hoc_Networks","3455182_On_Applying_Graph_Theory_to_ILP_Analysis","284368398_Application_of_Graph_Theory_in_Computer_Science_and_Engineering","271069314_Designing_Graph_Database_Models_from_Existing_Relational_Databases","258257454_'Applications_of_graph_coloring_in_Computer_science_An_overview","242628418_Computer_science_an_overview"]}
