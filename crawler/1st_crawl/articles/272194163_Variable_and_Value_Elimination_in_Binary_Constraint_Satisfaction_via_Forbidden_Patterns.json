{"id":"272194163_Variable_and_Value_Elimination_in_Binary_Constraint_Satisfaction_via_Forbidden_Patterns","abstract":"Variable or value elimination in a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) can\nbe used in preprocessing or during search to reduce search space size. A\nvariable elimination rule (value elimination rule) allows the polynomial-time\nidentification of certain variables (domain elements) whose elimination,\nwithout the introduction of extra compensatory constraints, does not affect the\nsatisfiability of an instance. We show that there are essentially just four\nvariable elimination rules and three value elimination rules defined by\nforbidding generic sub-instances, known as irreducible existential patterns, in\narc-consistent CSP instances. One of the variable elimination rules is the\nalready-known Broken Triangle Property, whereas the other three are novel. The\nthree value elimination rules can all be seen as strict generalisations of\nneighbourhood substitution.","authors":["David Cohen","Martin Cooper","Guillaume Escamocher","Stanislav Zivny"],"meta":["February 2015Journal of Computer and System Sciences 81(7)","DOI:10.1016/j.jcss.2015.02.001","SourcearXiv"],"references":["285320940_The_consequences_of_the_ellipsoid_method_for_combinatorial_optimization","281886829_Beyond_Consistency_and_Substitutability","277557390_On_Broken_Triangles","263046157_Some_New_Tractable_Classes_of_CSPs_and_Their_Relations_with_Backtracking_Algorithms","263045980_Microstructures_for_CSPs_with_Constraints_of_Arbitrary_Arity","259875151_Tractable_Triangles_and_Cross-Free_Convexity_in_Discrete_Optimisation","226824402_The_Ellipsoid_Method_and_its_Consequences_in_Combinatorial_Optimization","221632806_Perfect_Constraints_Are_Tractable","221438854_A_Microstructure_Based_Approach_to_Constraint_Satisfaction_Optimisation_Problems","220543422_Conflict-Directed_Backjumping_Revisited","220309097_A_weighted_CSP_approach_to_cost-optimal_planning","51990301_A_Dichotomy_for_2-Constraint_Forbidden_CSP_Patterns","51889184_Hybrid_Tractable_Classes_of_Binary_Quantified_Constraint_SatisfactionProblems","50305858_The_Tractability_of_CSP_Classes_Defined_by_Forbidden_Patterns","2841533_Boosting_Search_with_Variable_Elimination_in_Constraint_Optimization_and_Constraint_Satisfaction_Problems","286195972_Constraint_Processing","284107322_The_Electronic_Communications_Privacy_Act_Does_the_Answer_to_the_Internet_Information_Privacy_Problem_Lie_in_a_Fifteen-Year-Old_Federal_Statute_A_Detailed_Analysis","280246429_Constraint_Networks_Techniques_and_Algorithms","271464208_Compiling_CSPs_A_Complexity_Map_of_Non-Deterministic_Multivalued_Decision_Diagrams","266728712_3-coloring_in_time_O13446_n_A_no-MIS_algorithm","251470841_Chapter_4_Constraint_Programming","229299039_Efficient_systematic_analysis_of_occlusion","222695880_Consistency_Restoration_and_Explanations_in_Dynamic_CSPs_-_Application_to_Configuration","222561034_Generalizing_constraint_satisfaction_on_trees_Hybrid_tractability_and_variable_elimination","222528186_Conflict-directed_A_and_its_role_in_model-based_embedded_systems","221633392_Watched_literals_for_constraint_propagation_in_MINION","221603492_Eliminating_Interchangeable_Values_in_Constraint_Satisfaction_Problems","220547543_An_Optimal_Coarse-Grained_Arc_Consistency_Algorithm","220546620_Fundamental_Properties_of_Neighbourhood_Substitution_in_Constraint_Satisfaction_Problems","220269309_Decomposition_of_Domains_Based_on_the_Micro-Structure_of_Finite_Constraint-Satisfaction_Problems","216824899_Hybrid_Algorithms_for_the_Constraint_Satisfaction_Problem","4038147_A_polynomial_algorithm_for_recognizing_perfect_graphs","3635326_3-coloring_in_time_013446_A_no-MIS_algorithm","1761513_A_Dichotomy_Theorem_for_General_Minimum_Cost_Homomorphism_Problem"]}
