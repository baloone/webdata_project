{"id":"274474178_Modal_twist-structures_over_residuated_lattices","abstract":"We introduce a class of algebras, called twist-structures, whose members are built as special squares of an arbitrary residuated lattice. We show how our construction relates to and encompasses results obtained by several authors on the algebraic semantics of non-classical logics. We define a logic that corresponds to our twist-structures and show how to expand it with modal operators, obtaining a paraconsistent many-valued modal logic that generalizes existing work on modal expansions of both Belnap-Dunn logic and paraconsistent Nelson logic.
