{"id":"229360278_Reference_systems_in_cognitive_maps","abstract":"Reference systems encoded in cognitive maps of large-scale environments were investigated in three experiments. In Experiment I direction estimates to places which could not be seen were made relative to directions faced in actual places, relative to directions faced in pictures of these actual places, and relative to the North direction. Compared with less familiar places in the town investigated, the reference directions in more familiar places were more accurate and in better agreement between spatially separated places. In equally familiar places performance of one-year residents of the town was only slightly better than one- to two-months residents' performance. The reference directions were more accurate and in better agreement when perceptually available in actual places rather than in pictures. Better agreement between the North directions in different places than between the perceptually available reference directions in pictures was observed but the former, in contrast to the latter, was systematically misaligned with the downtown street grid. The agreement between perceptually available reference directions was furthermore better in downtown than in outskirts places. The results of Experiment 2 in which subjects directly estimated the North direction in places portrayed by pictures were largely consistent with the results of the first experiment with regard to the accuracy with which the North direction was encoded, and the results of Experiment 3, in which subjects directly estimated the angle between directions faced in pictures of pairs of spatially separated places, confirmed the results of Experiment 1 with regard to the agreement between perceptual reference directions. Taken together, the results indicated that reference systems encoded in cognitive maps have some properties of a global reference system even after relatively short time of residence. Short distances to travel between places and a regular street grid connecting the places furthermore appear to facilitate acquisition of a global reference system.","authors":["Tommy Gärling","Erik Lindberg","Manuel Carreiras","Böök Anders"],"meta":["March 1986Journal of Environmental Psychology 6(1):1-18","DOI:10.1016/S0272-4944(86)80031-7"],"references":["16953024_Hemenway_K_Objects_parts_and_categories_J_Exp_Psychol_Gen_113_169-193","313553641_The_development_of_spatial_cognition_A_review","312616093_Environmental_Cognition","292414610_The_acquisition_and_utilization_of_spatial_knowledge","264620432_Comprehending_the_Urban_Environment_Theory_and_Practice","249624016_Cognitive_Mapping_of_Large-Scale_EnvironmentsThe_Interrelationship_of_Action_Plans_Acquisition_and_Orientation","249623248_Environmental_Learning_and_Cognitive_Mapping","243540164_Canonical_perspective_and_the_perception_of_objects","238791467_Modelling_Spatial_Knowledge","235151700_Cognitive_Skill_Implications_for_Spatial_Skill_in_Large-Scale_Environments","232492276_Environmental_Cognition","232456361_Spatial_orientation_and_wayfinding_in_the_designed_environment_A_conceptual_analysis_and_some_suggestions_for_postoccupancy_evaluation","227146826_Acquisition_of_different_types_of_locational_information_in_cognitive_maps_Automatic_or_effortful_processing","223378265_Distortions_in_Memory_of_Maps","223347500_The_effects_of_pathway_configuration_landmarks_and_stress_on_environmental_cognition","222452670_Modeling_Spatial_Knowledge","222440938_Categories_of_Environmental_Scense","222022901_Memory_for_the_spatial_layout_of_the_everyday_physical_environment_Factors_affecting_rate_of_acquisition","216305422_The_Development_of_Spatial_Cognition_A_Review","22052780_The_Development_of_Spatial_Representations_of_Large-Scale_Environments","21905233_Memory_for_descriptive_and_spatial_information_in_complex_pictures","19571378_Memory_for_spatial_location_in_two-dimensional_arrays","16739427_Maintenance_of_orientation_during_locomotion_in_unfamiliar_environments","16141356_Memory_for_the_Spatial_Layout_of_the_Everyday_Physical_Environment_Differential_Rates_of_Acquisition_of_Different_Types_of_Information","16051924_Acquisition_of_locational_information_about_reference_points_during_locomotion_The_role_of_central_information_processing","2368136_The_Map_in_the_Head_Metaphor"]}
