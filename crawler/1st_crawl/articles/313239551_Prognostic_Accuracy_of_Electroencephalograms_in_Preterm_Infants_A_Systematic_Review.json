{"id":"313239551_Prognostic_Accuracy_of_Electroencephalograms_in_Preterm_Infants_A_Systematic_Review","abstract":"Context: \nBrain injury is common in preterm infants, and predictors of neurodevelopmental outcome are relevant.\n\nObjective: \nTo assess the prognostic test accuracy of the background activity of the EEG recorded as amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG) or conventional EEG early in life in preterm infants for predicting neurodevelopmental outcome.\n\nData sources: \nThe Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature.\n\nStudy selection: \nWe included observational studies that had obtained an aEEG or EEG within 7 days of life in preterm infants and reported neurodevelopmental outcomes 1 to 10 years later.\n\nData extraction: \nTwo reviewers independently performed data extraction with regard to participants, prognostic testing, and outcomes.\n\nResults: \nThirteen observational studies with a total of 1181 infants were included. A meta-analysis was performed based on 3 studies (267 infants). Any aEEG background abnormality was a predictor of abnormal outcome. For prediction of a developmental quotient <70 points, cerebral palsy, or death, the pooled sensitivity was 0.83 (95% confidence interval, 0.69-0.92) and specificity 0.83 (95% confidence interval, 0.77-0.87).\n\nLimitations: \nAll studies were at high risk of bias. Heterogeneity was evident among the studies with regard to the investigated aEEG and EEG variables, neurodevelopmental outcomes, and cutoff values.\n\nConclusions: \naEEG or EEG recorded within the first 7 days of life in preterm infants may have potential as a predictor for later neurodevelopmental outcome. We need high-quality studies to confirm these findings. Meanwhile, the prognostic value of aEEG and EEG should be used only as a scientific tool.","authors":["Emilie Pi Fogtmann","Anne Mette Plomgaard","Gorm Greisen","Christian Gluud"],"meta":["January 2017PEDIATRICS 139(2)","DOI:10.1542/peds.2016-1951"],"references":["294256790_Comparison_of_the_Combined_versus_Conventional_Apgar_Scores_in_Predicting_Adverse_Neonatal_Outcomes","273703930_Use_of_GRADE_for_assessment_of_evidence_about_prognosis_Rating_confidence_in_estimates_of_event_rates_in_broad_categories_of_patients","324561977_Predictive_value_of_S-100b_protein_for_prognosis_in_patients_with_moderate_and_severe_traumatic_brain_injury_systematic_review_and_meta-analysis","314436382_Neurological_and_Developmental_Outcome_in_Extremely_Preterm_Children_Born_in_England_in_1995_and_2006_The_EPICure_Studies","295241616_Gestational_age_and_birthweight_for_risk_assessment_of_neurodevelopmental_impairment_or_death_in_extremely_preterm_infants","281477708_Cochrane_handbook_for_systematic_reviews_of_diagnostic_test_accuracy_-_Chapter_10_analysing_and_presenting_results","279730075_Chorioamnionitis_and_neonatal_outcome_in_preterm_infants_A_clinical_overview","277779353_Being_Born_Small_for_Gestational_Age_Influences_Amplitude-Integrated_Electroencephalography_and_Later_Outcome_in_Preterm_Infants","273067012_Early_amplitude-integrated_EEG_monitoring_6_h_after_birth_predicts_long-term_neurodevelopment_of_asphyxiated_late_preterm_infants","269114874_Neonatal_Survival_After_Prolonged_Preterm_Premature_Rupture_of_Membranes_Before_24_Weeks_of_Gestation"]}
