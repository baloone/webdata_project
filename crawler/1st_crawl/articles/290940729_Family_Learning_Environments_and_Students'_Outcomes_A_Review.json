{"id":"290940729_Family_Learning_Environments_and_Students'_Outcomes_A_Review","abstract":"Research is reviewed that has examined relationships between family learning environments and students' school-related outcomes. Studies are organized into three general categories which have been labeled as socio-ariihmetic environmental research, family structural characteristics, and environmental press of families. The review suggests that students' learning outcomes should be considered as being embedded in status structures defined by gender, ethnicity, and social class and that within those encompassing structures, student outcomes are influenced by the allocation and socialization characteristics of families.","authors":["Kevin Marjoribanks"],"meta":["August 1996Journal of Comparative Family Studies 27(2):373-394","DOI:10.3138/jcfs.27.2.373"],"references":["291764215_Origins_and_destinations_Review_symposium","254273575_Ethnicity_families_as_opportunity_structures_and_adolescents'_aspirations","245557177_Australian_Families_and_Adolescents''Aspirations_A_Follow-up_Analysis","240532711_Sociology_and_the_Equality_Debate","225409572_Family_and_school_environments_adolescents'_aspirations_and_young_adults'_status_attainment_Ability-attitude_group_differences","15268716_Sibling_and_environmental_correlates_of_adolescents'_aspirations_Family_group_differences"]}
