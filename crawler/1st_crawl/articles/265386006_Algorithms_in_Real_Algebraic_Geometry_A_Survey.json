{"id":"265386006_Algorithms_in_Real_Algebraic_Geometry_A_Survey","abstract":"We survey both old and new developments in the theory of algorithms in real\nalgebraic geometry -- starting from effective quantifier elimination in the\nfirst order theory of reals due to Tarski and Seidenberg, to more recent\nalgorithms for computing topological invariants of semi-algebraic sets. We\nemphasize throughout the complexity aspects of these algorithms and also\ndiscuss the computational hardness of the underlying problems. We also describe\nsome recent results linking the computational hardness of decision problems in\nthe first order theory of the reals, with that of computing certain topological\ninvariants of semi-algebraic sets. Even though we mostly concentrate on exact\nalgorithms, we also discuss some numerical approaches involving semi-definite\nprogramming that have gained popularity in recent times.","authors":["Saugata Basu"],"meta":["September 2014","SourcearXiv"],"references":["255980743_Counting_connected_components_of_a_semialgebraic_set_in_subexponential_time","250785354_Betti_Number_Bounds_Applications_and_Algorithms","240268385_Sums_of_Squares_of_Real_Polynomials","236737588_Divide_and_Conquer_Roadmap_for_Algebraic_Sets","227274910_Computing_the_Euler-Poincare_characteristics_of_sign_conditions","226153347_An_exact_duality_theory_for_semidefinite_programming_and_its_complexity_implications","225355464_Convergent_SDP-Relaxations_for_Polynomial_Optimization_with_Sparsity","221660787_A_Baby_Step-Giant_Step_Roadmap_Algorithm_for_General_Algebraic_Sets","221559657_Relational_Expressive_Power_of_Constraint_Query_Languages","322490578_COMPLEXITY_OF_THE_MOVER'S_PROBLEM_AND_GENERALIZATIONS","321516067_Algorithms_in_Real_Algebraic_Geometry","313719973_Relational_expressive_power_of_constraint_query_languages","268169262_Complexity_and_real_computation_Foreword_by_Richard_M_Karp","267669849_Computing_the_Betti_numbers_of_semi-algebraic_sets_defined_by_partly_quadratic_systems_of_polynomials","266434328_Triangulation_of_semi-analytic_sets","264956314_A_Decision_Method_for_Elementary_Algebra_and_Geometry","262289362_Topological_methods","259102257_A_Sum_of_Squares_Approximation_of_Nonnegative_Polynomials","256926645_A_Complexity_Theory_of_Constructible_Functions_and_Sheaves","253330415_A_nearly_optimal_algorithm_for_deciding_connectivity_queries_in_smooth_and_bounded_real_algebraic_sets","249625878_Quantifier_Elimination_for_Real_Closed_Fields_by_Cylindrical_Algebraic_Decomposition","248817657_On_the_Piano_Movers_problem_II_General_techniques_for_computing_topological_properties_of_real_algebraic_manifolds","247029122_On_the_Betti_Numbers_of_Real_Varieties","246503740_Interior_Point_Algorithms_in_Convex_Programming","245792509_Convergent_semidelunite_relaxations_in_polynomial_optimization_with_sparsity","243787644_Semi-Algebraic_Local-Triviality_in_Semi-Algebraic_Mappings","242362429_Petrovskii_on_the_topology_of_real_algebraic_surfaces","231965098_Bounds_for_gradient_trajectories_and_geodesic_diameter_of_real_algebraic_sets","227280719_On_Bounding_the_Betti_Numbers_and_Computing_the_Euler_Characteristic_of_Semi-Algebraic_Sets","227137103_Efficient_algorithm_for_computing_the_Euler-Poincare_characteristic_of_a_semi-algebraic_set_defined_by_few_quadratic_inequalities","226953709_Polynomial_Hierarchy_Betti_Numbers_and_a_Real_Analogue_of_Toda's_Theorem","226882819_Description_of_the_connected_components_of_a_semialgebraic_set_in_single_exponential_time","226371874_Construction_of_roadmaps_in_semi-algebraic_sets","225996594_Polar_Varieties_and_Efficient_Real_Elimination","225671754_The_Complexity_of_Stratification_Computation","225371656_On_the_geometry_of_polar_varieties","225223959_Computing_the_Top_Betti_Numbers_of_Semialgebraic_Sets_Defined_by_Quadratic_Inequalities_in_Polynomial_Time","225155358_On_Sign_Conditions_Over_Real_Multivariate_Polynomials","225152575_There_are_Significantly_More_Nonnegative_Polynomials_than_Sums_of_Squares","224044130_An_Introduction_to_Algebraic_Topology","223162365_Thom's_lemma_the_coding_of_real_algebraic_numbers_and_the_computation_of_the_topology_of_semi-algebraic_sets","223013670_Real_quantifier_elimination_is_doubly_exponential","222850476_The_complexity_of_elementary_algebra_and_geometry","222822781_On_the_minimum_of_a_positive_polynomial_over_the_standard_simplex","222574431_A_new_bound_for_Polya_Theorem_with_applications_to_polynomials_positive_on_polyhedra","222497820_An_algorithm_for_sums_of_squares_of_real_polynomials","222429421_Computing_the_First_Few_Betti_Numbers_of_Semi-algebraic_Sets_in_Single_Exponential_Time","222030230_Complexity_of_computation_on_real_algebraic_numbers","221590721_Feasibility_Testing_for_Systems_of_Real_Quadratic_Equations","221563985_Polar_Varieties_and_Computation_of_one_Point_in_each_Connected_Component_of_a_Smooth_Real_Algebraic_Set","220452494_Betti_Numbers_of_Semialgebraic_Sets_Defined_by_Quantifier-Free_Formulae","221220319_Hauptvortrag_Quantifier_elimination_for_real_closed_fields_by_cylindrical_algebraic_decomposition","220616368_PP_is_as_Hard_as_the_Polynomial-Time_Hierarchy","220452395_Properness_Defects_of_Projections_and_Computation_of_at_Least_One_Point_in_Each_Connected_Component_of_a_Real_Algebraic_Set","220452338_A_Baby_StepsGiant_Steps_Probabilistic_Algorithm_for_Computing_Roadmaps_in_Smooth_Bounded_Real_Hypersurface"]}
