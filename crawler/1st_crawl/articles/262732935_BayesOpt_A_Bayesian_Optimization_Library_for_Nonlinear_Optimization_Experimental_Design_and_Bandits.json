{"id":"262732935_BayesOpt_A_Bayesian_Optimization_Library_for_Nonlinear_Optimization_Experimental_Design_and_Bandits","abstract":"BayesOpt is a library with state-of-the-art Bayesian optimization methods to solve nonlin-ear optimization, stochastic bandits or sequential experimental design problems. Bayesian optimization characterized for being sample efficient as it builds a posterior distribution to capture the evidence and prior knowledge of the target function. Built in standard C++, the library is extremely efficient while being portable and exible. It includes a common interface for C, C++, Python, Matlab and Octave.","authors":["Ruben Martinez-Cantin"],"meta":["November 2014Journal of Machine Learning Research 15:3735-3739","SourcearXiv"],"references":["261353397_Bayesian_optimisation_for_Intelligent_Environmental_Monitoring","226216344_Lipschitzian_Optimisation_Without_the_Lipschitz_Constant","321522296_Bayesian_Approach_to_Global_Optimization","304781977_Algorithms_for_hyper-parameter_optimization","304168151_Bayesian_global_optimizationBayesian_Global_Optimization","301362356_The_NLopt_nonlinear-optimization_package","241269439_The_BOBYQA_Algorithm_for_Bound_Constrained_Optimization_without_Derivatives","234083201_Bayesian_Optimization_in_a_Billion_Dimensions_via_Random_Embeddings","226501199_Bayesian_Approach_to_Global_Optimization","225307589_Practical_Bayesian_Optimization_of_Machine_Learning_Algorithms"]}
