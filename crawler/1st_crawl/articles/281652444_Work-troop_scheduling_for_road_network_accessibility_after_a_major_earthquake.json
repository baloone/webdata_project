{"id":"281652444_Work-troop_scheduling_for_road_network_accessibility_after_a_major_earthquake","abstract":"The road network accessibility is an important issue for post-earthquake relief operations,\nsince several roads may be damaged obstructing the access to certain areas.\nThis work proposes a mathematical model and some heuristics for the road repairing\nwork-troops scheduling in order to increase accessibility to the population as\nfast as possible after a major earthquake. Solutions for small instances given by the\nmodel are used to evaluate the heuristics performance. The heuristics are tested on\na graph with more than ten thousand vertices and edges from Port Au Prince 2010\nearthquake in Haiti.","authors":["Celso Sakuraba","Andr√©a Cynthia Santos","Christian Prins"],"meta":["May 2015","Conference: The 7th International Network Optimization Conference (INOC)At: Warsaw, Poland","Project: Optimizing logistics for large scale disasters (OLIC)"],"references":["259158979_A_mathematical_model_for_post-disaster_road_restoration_Enabling_accessibility_and_evacuation","225560798_A_GRASP_metaheuristic_to_improve_accessibility_after_a_disaster","273391583_Optimal_Scheduling_for_Highway_Emergency_Repairs_Under_Large-Scale_Supply-Demand_Perturbations","242562037_A_Note_on_Two_Problems_in_Connexion_with_Graphs","229387283_Optimization_models_in_emergency_logistics_A_literature_review","223804937_Optimal_Scheduling_of_Emergency_Roadway_Repair_and_Subsequent_Relief_Distribution"]}
