{"id":"254200882_Parameter-dependant_state_observer_design_for_affine_LPV_systems","abstract":"In this paper, the design of a parameter-dependent state observer that allows to estimate the state of an affine linear parameter-varying (LPV) system is investigated. The observer has the property of being parameter-dependent since the corresponding state space matrices are scheduled using an interpolation method. Moreover, the stability of the estimation error is based on the existence of an affine parameter-dependent Lyapunov function. The main contribution of this paper is that the problem of the observer design and the existence of such a Lyapunov function is interpreted as a flexible LMI feasibility condition. Some illustrative examples are presented at the end of this paper.","authors":["Iula Bara","Jamal Daafouz","Frédéric Kratz","José Ragot"],"meta":["November 2001International Journal of Control 74(16)","DOI:10.1080/00207170110086953"],"references":["258985778_Survey_of_gain-scheduling_analysis_and_design","3892262_State_estimation_for_affine_LPV_system","3884621_Stabilization_of_Affine_Polynomial_Families_an_LMI_Approach","3611434_Global_optimization_approach_for_the_BMI_problem","3023619_Robust_control_via_concave_minimization_local_and_global_algorithms","3022863_A_cone_complementarity_linearization_algorithm_for_static_output-feedback_and_related_problems","3022487_Affine_Parameter-Dependent_Lyapunov_Functions_and_Real_Parametric_Uncertainty","2519496_A_Path-following_Method_for_Solving_BMI_Problems_in_Control","263192249_Stability_preserving_interpolation_methods_for_the_synthesis_of_gain_scheduled_controllers","225075365_Necessary_and_sufficient_conditions_for_quadratic_stabilizability_of_an_uncertain_system","222582622_Missile_autopilot_design_via_a_modified_LPV_synthesis_technique","222502876_Rank-one_LMI_Approach_to_Simultaneous_Stabilization_of_Linear_Systems","222492474_A_New_Discrete-Time_Robust_Stability_Condition","222003598_Design_of_controllers_for_linear_parameter-varying_systems_by_the_gain_scheduling_technique","220159667_Research_on_Gain_Scheduling","3891686_Analysis_eigenstructure_assignment_and_H2_multichannel_synthesis_with_enhanced_LMI_characterizations","3331737_Gain_Scheduling_for_H-infinity_Controllers_A_Flight_Control_Example","3023415_Interpolation_of_observer_state_feedback_controllers_for_gain_scheduling","2644218_Semidefinite_Programming_Relaxations_Of_Non-Convex_Problems_In_Control_And_Combinatorial_Optimization","2496876_A_Global_BMI_Algorithm_Based_on_the_Generalized_Benders_Decomposition"]}
