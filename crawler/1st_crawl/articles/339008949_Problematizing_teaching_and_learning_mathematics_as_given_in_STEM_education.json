{"id":"339008949_Problematizing_teaching_and_learning_mathematics_as_given_in_STEM_education","abstract":"Mathematics is fundamental for many professions, especially science, technology, and engineering. Yet, mathematics is often perceived as difficult and many students leave disciplines in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) as a result, closing doors to scientific, engineering, and technological careers. In this editorial, we argue that how mathematics is traditionally viewed as “given” or “fixed” for students’ expected acquisition alienates many students and needs to be problematized. We propose an alternative approach to changes in mathematics education and show how the alternative also applies to STEM education.","authors":["Yeping Li","Alan H Schoenfeld"],"meta":["December 2019International Journal of STEM Education 6(1)","DOI:10.1186/s40594-019-0197-9"],"references":["341492493_Mathematical_practices_in_theory_and_practice","336919445_Design_and_Design_Thinking_in_STEM_Education","331402669_On_Thinking_and_STEM_Education","329834226_Four_years_of_development_as_a_gathering_place_for_international_researchers_and_readers_in_STEM_education","327447919_On_Classroom_Observations","336095362_'Setting_a_Task'_in_German_Schools_Different_Frames_for_Different_Ambitions","333308102_Teaching_Practices_That_Support_Student_Sensemaking_Across_Grades_and_Disciplines_A_Conceptual_Review","332933090_Reframing_teacher_knowledge_a_research_and_development_agenda","330760028_International_Handbook_of_Mathematical_Learning_Difficulties_From_the_Laboratory_to_the_Classroom_From_the_Laboratory_to_the_Classroom","328893162_Journal_for_STEM_Education_Research_-_Promoting_the_Development_of_Interdisciplinary_Research_in_STEM_Education"]}
