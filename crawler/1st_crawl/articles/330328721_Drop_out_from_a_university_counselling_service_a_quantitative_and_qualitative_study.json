{"id":"330328721_Drop_out_from_a_university_counselling_service_a_quantitative_and_qualitative_study","abstract":"This paper aims to examine the characteristics of students who withdrew from a university counselling service in northern Italy. Differences found in the socio-demographic characteristics of counselling completers and drop outs and in the scores obtained in questionnaires administered at the outset were analysed. Furthermore, in order to identify reasons for dropping out, a qualitative approach was also used. The results suggest that premature termination is not a unitary phenomenon and that drop outs are a heterogeneous group. This study also shows that it is important not to always consider drop outs as a negative outcome of university counselling services. Additional research on drop out is needed to increase the capacity of university counselling services to serve students more effectively.","authors":["Chiara Buizza","Alberto Ghilardi","Elena Olivetti","Andrea Costa"],"meta":["January 2019British Journal of Guidance and Counselling 47(1):1-13","DOI:10.1080/03069885.2019.1566513"],"references":["319470305_Clinical_outcomes_of_psychotherapy_dropouts_Does_dropping_out_of_psychotherapy_necessarily_mean_failure","311394117_The_effectiveness_of_university_counselling_for_improving_academic_outcomes_and_well-being","276441389_The_Effectiveness_of_Clinical_Colloquium_Established_by_the_Drawing_Recall_Technique_in_University_Counselling_Services_for_Student_Mental_Health","261678606_Dose-Effect_Relations_for_Psychotherapy_of_Mild_Depression_A_Quasi-Experimental_Comparison_of_Effects_of_2_8_and_16_Sessions","247508219_The_helping_alliance_and_premature_termination","247508174_A_study_of_engagement_and_premature_termination_in_a_university_counseling_center","232842237_The_effectiveness_of_UK_student_counselling_services_An_analysis_using_the_CORE_System","232577183_Barriers_to_effective_cross-cultural_counseling","232008091_An_Uncontrolled_Evaluation_of_Group_Behavioural_Activation_for_Depression","229858409_Uno_strumento_aggiornato_per_la_misura_degli_stili_di_coping_Il_Coping_Orientation_to_the_Problems_Experienced-Nuova_Versione_Italiana_COPE-NVI","228748883_Preliminary_Evidence_on_the_Effectiveness_of_Psychological_Treatments_Delivered_at_a_University_Counseling_Center","224050868_Premature_Discontinuation_in_Adult_Psychotherapy_A_Meta-Analysis","45094425_Ethno-Cultural_Variations_in_the_Experience_and_Meaning_of_Mental_Illness_and_Treatment_Implications_for_Access_and_Utilization","38019465_Early_Withdrawal_from_Mental_Health_Treatment_implications_for_Psychotherapy_Practice","14096625_The_Validity_of_two_Versions_of_the_GHQ_in_the_WHO_Study_of_Mental_Illness_in_General_Health_Care","7515511_You_want_to_Measure_Coping_But_Your_Protocols_Too_Long_Consider_the_Brief_COPE","320534359_A_follow-up_study_on_students_attending_a_university_counselling_service_in_Northern_Italy","315463681_Therapist_Effects_on_Dropout_From_a_College_Counseling_Center_Practice_Research_Network","305393695_The_Contribution_of_Therapist_Effects_to_Patient_Dropout_and_Deterioration_in_the_Psychological_Therapies_Therapist_Effects_on_Patient_Dropout_and_Deterioration","302910850_Therapist_Effects_on_and_Predictors_of_Non-Consensual_Dropout_in_Psychotherapy","286205837_Il_Servizio_di_Aiuto_Psicologico_SAP_dell'Universita_di_Bologna","285711658_Symptom-Checklist_SCL-90-R","283739988_Cognitive_counselling_intervention_treatment_effectiveness_in_an_Italian_university_centre","280803230_Il_counselling_psicodinamico_per_studenti_universitari_Una_ricerca_empirica_di_valutazione_dell'efficacia","279230151_An_analysis_of_the_effectiveness_of_university_counselling_services","274063253_Premature_Termination_in_Psychotherapy_Strategies_for_Engaging_Clients_and_Improving_Outcomes","274063151_Swift_JK_Greenberg_RP_2015_Premature_Terrmination_in_Psychotherapy_Strategies_for_Engaging_Clients_and_Improving_Outcomes_Washington_DC_APA_Books","272229452_Moher_D_Schulz_KF_Altman_D_for_the_CONSORT_GroupThe_CONSORT_statement_revised_recommendations_for_improving_the_quality_of_reports_of_parallel-group_randomized_trials_JAMA_285_1987-1991","267743775_Good-enough_level_and_dose-effect_models_Variation_among_outcomes_and_therapists","263718565_Contributing_Factors_to_Early_Premature_Termination_at_a_College_Counseling_Center","261989981_Predicting_Psychotherapy_Dropouts_A_Multilevel_Approach","261182449_Methodological_issues_related_to_qualitative_telephone_interviews_on_sensitive_topics","240239133_Brief_work_with_adolescents_and_young_adults_in_a_counselling_service","232585393_A_follow-up_of_clients_placed_on_a_counseling_center_waiting_list","232539710_Characteristics_of_Black_Students_Seeking_Help_at_a_University_Counseling_Center","227018370_Premature_termination_of_conselling_at_a_university_Counselling_Centre","51099627_Mental_Health_Service_Utilization_Among_College_Students_in_the_United_States","49849115_Psychometric_properties_of_the_Italian_version_of_the_SCL-90-R_A_study_on_a_large_community_sample","17749487_Psychiatric_Illness_in_General_Practice_A_Detailed_Study_Using_a_New_Method_of_Case_Identification","15306005_Reliability_validity_and_factor_structure_of_the_12-item_General_Health_Questionnaire_among_young_males_in_Italy","11178895_Reasons_for_therapy_termination_in_a_university_psychology_clinic","10824673_The_CONSORT_Statement_Revised_Recommendations_for_Improving_the_Quality_of_Reports_of_Parallel-Group_Randomized_Trials","8881380_Qualitative_Content_Analysis_in_Nursing_Research_Concepts_Procedures_and_Measures_to_Achieve_Trustworthiness","5648682_Is_There_a_Bias_Against_Telephone_Interviews_In_Qualitative_Research","5499399_The_qualitative_content_analysis"]}
