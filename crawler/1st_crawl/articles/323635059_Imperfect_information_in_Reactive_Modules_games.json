{"id":"323635059_Imperfect_information_in_Reactive_Modules_games","abstract":"Reactive Modules is a high-level modelling language for concurrent, distributed, and multi-agent systems, which is used in a number of practical model checking tools. Reactive Modules Games are a game-theoretic extension of Reactive Modules, in which system components are assumed to act strategically in an attempt to satisfy a temporal logic formula representing their individual goal. Reactive Modules Games with perfect information have been extensively studied, and the complexity of game theoretic decision problems relating to such games (such as the existence of Nash equilibria) have been comprehensively classified. In this article, we study Reactive Modules Games in which agents have only partial visibility of their environment.","authors":["Julian Gutierrez","Giuseppe Perelli","Michael Wooldridge"],"meta":["March 2018Information and Computation 261(2)","DOI:10.1016/j.ic.2018.02.023","Project: Reasoning about Computational Economies (RACE)"],"references":["313602434_Decidability_results_for_ATL_with_imperfect_information_and_perfect_recall","303930692_A_Tool_for_the_Automated_Verification_of_Nash_Equilibria_in_Concurrent_Games","303617687_MCMAS_an_open-source_model_checker_for_the_verification_of_multi-agent_systems","272510052_Module_Checking_of_Strategic_Ability","269994323_Reasoning_About_Strategies_On_the_Model-Checking_Problem_preprint","266888264_Logics_for_Reasoning_about_Strategic_Abilities_in_Multi-Player_Games","262219980_A_logic_of_revelation_and_concealment","260193259_MCMAS-SLK_A_Model_Checker_for_the_Verification_of_Strategy_Logic_Specifications","239550938_The_Logic_of_Games_and_its_Applications","234827421_On_the_synthesis_of_a_reactive_module","234785237_The_complexity_of_propositional_linear_temporal_logics_Journal_of_the_ACM_JACM_323_733-749","225117200_On_the_synthesis_of_an_asynchronous_reactive_module","221455156_On_the_complexity_of_practical_ATL_model_checking","221402880_PRISM_40_Verification_of_Probabilistic_Real-time_Systems","220298303_Cooperation_Knowledge_and_Time_Alternating-Time_Temporal_Epistemic_Logic_and_its_Applications","220148212_The_Complementation_Problem_for_Buchi_Automata_with_Appplications_to_Temporal_Logic","316080793_From_model_checking_to_equilibrium_checking_Reactive_modules_for_rational_verification","315538231_Strategy_Logic_with_Imperfect_Information","303969276_Alternating-Time_Temporal_Logic","303336305_Imperfect_Information_in_Reactive_Modules_Games","282181362_ATLsc_with_partial_observation","270656992_Computer_science_Solving_imperfect-information_games","262350240_Iterated_Boolean_games","262246172_Concurrent_Games_with_Ordered_Objectives","261799525_Games_with_a_Weak_Adversary","230625814_Temporal_and_Modal_Logic","224586519_Applications_of_Game_Semantics_From_Program_Analysis_to_Hardware_Synthesis","223027116_Strategy_logic","222675562_On_the_logic_of_cooperation_and_propositional_control","222656888_Lower_bounds_for_multiplayer_noncooperative_games_of_incomplete_information","221558104_Coordination_Logic","220700526_Model_Checking_a_Path","220616359_Provably_Difficult_Combinatorial_Games","220574360_A_Survey_of_Stochastic_o-Regular_Games","220267882_Nash_Equilibria_in_Concurrent_Games_with_Buchi_Objectives","45862765_Rational_Synthesis","4175501_Uniform_distributed_synthesis","4085213_A_landscape_with_games_in_the_background","2819612_MOCHA_modularity_in_model_checking","2322570_Reactive_Modules"]}
