{"id":"226855716_Variational_fluid_flow_measurements_from_image_sequences_Synopsis_and_perspectives","abstract":"Variational approaches to image motion segmentation has been an active field of study in image processing and computer vision\nfor two decades. We present a short overview over basic estimation schemes and report in more detail recent modifications\nand applications to fluid flow estimation. Key properties of these approaches are illustrated by numerical examples. We outline\npromising research directions and point out the potential of variational techniques in combination with correlation-based\nPIV methods, for improving the consistency of fluid flow estimation and simulation.","authors":["Dominique Heitz","Étienne Mémin","Christoph Schnörr"],"meta":["March 2010Experiments in Fluids 48(3):369-393","DOI:10.1007/s00348-009-0778-3","SourceOAI"],"references":["321614380_Particle_Image_Velocimetry_A_Practical_Guide","350442573_Mathematics_of_Large_Eddy_Simulation_of_Turbulent_Flows","321620115_Mathematical_Problems_in_Image_Processing_Partial_Differential_Equations_and_the_Calculus_of_Variations","321604012_Handbook_of_Mathematical_Models_in_Computer_Vision","314404294_Image_Warping_by_Radial_Basis_Functions_Application_to_Facial_Expressions","312394519_Pressure_image_assimilation_for_atmospheric_motion_estimation","301097308_Control_of_Systems_Governed_by_Parabolic_Partial_Differential_Equations","300422402_Image_Processing_and_Analysis","291154059_Principal_warps_Thin-plate_splines_and_the_decomposition_of_deformations","285499542_Robust_Statistics","284437922_Variational_algorithms_for_analysis_and_assimilation_of_meteorological_observations_Theoretical_aspects","280778126_Particle-Imaging_Techniques_for_Experimental_Fluid_Mechanics","279614551_Differential_Geometry_from_the_Frenet_Point_of_View_Boundary_Detection_Stereo_Texture_and_Color","275069569_A_Description_Of_Eddying_Motions_And_Flow_Patterns_Using_Critical-Point_Concepts","270203152_Spline_Models_for_Observational_Data"]}
