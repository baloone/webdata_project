{"id":"304122124_Robust_adaptive_control_of_a_class_of_nonlinear_systems_with_unknown_dead-zone","abstract":"This paper deals with the adaptive control of a class of continuous-time nonlinear dynamic systems preceded by an unknown dead-zone. By using a new description of a dead-zone and by exploring the properties of this dead-zone model intuitively and mathematically, a robust adaptive control scheme is developed without constructing the dead-zone inverse. The new adaptive control law ensures global stability of the adaptive system and achieves desired tracking precision. Simulations performed on a typical nonlinear system illustrate and clarify the validity of this approach","authors":["Xing-Song Wang","Chun-Yi Su","H.
