{"id":"222693645_The_origins_of_structural_operational_semantics","abstract":"We review the origins of structural operational semantics. The main publication `A Structural Approach to Operational Semantics,' also known as the `Aarhus Notes,' appeared in 1981 [G.D. Plotkin, A structural approach to operational semantics, DAIMI FN-19, Computer Science Department, Aarhus University, 1981]. The development of the ideas dates back to the early 1970s, involving many people and building on previous work on programming languages and logic. The former included abstract syntax, the SECD machine, and the abstract interpreting machines of the Vienna school; the latter included the λ-calculus and formal systems.The initial development of structural operational semantics was for simple functional languages, more or less variations of the λ-calculus; after that the ideas were gradually extended to include languages with parallel features, such as Milner's CCS. This experience set the ground for a more systematic exposition, the subject of an invited course of lectures at Aarhus University; some of these appeared in print as the 1981 Notes.We discuss the content of these lectures and some related considerations such as `small state' versus `grand state,' structural versus compositional semantics, the influence of the Scott–Strachey approach to denotational semantics, the treatment of recursion and jumps, and static semantics. We next discuss relations with other work and some immediate further development. We conclude with an account of an old, previously unpublished, idea: an alternative, perhaps more readable, graphical presentation of systems of rules for operational semantics.","authors":["Gordon D Plotkin"],"meta":["July 2004Journal of Logic and Algebraic Programming 60-61(1):3-15","DOI:10.1016/j.jlap.2004.03.009","SourceDBLP"],"references":["242406560_Outline_of_a_Mathematical_Theory_of_Computation","221268033_Scientific_Decisions_which_Characterize_VDM","220690943_Some_extensional_term_models_for_combinatory_logics_and_l-calculi","330299382_An_operational_semantics_of_multitasking_and_exception_handling_in_Ada","311473076_Recursive_definitions_of_partial_functions_and_their_computations","311465608_Recursive_definitions_of_partial_functions_and_their_computations","281506211_Ten_years_of_Hoare's_logic_A_survey-part_II","268643120_Constructive_Mathematics_and_Computer_Programming","268243743_Theory_of_Formal_System","267010969_Program_semantics_and_mechanized_proof","266425464_The_p-Calculus_A_Theory_of_Mobile_Processes","266249757_The_next_700_programming_languages","266063222_Dijkstra's_predicate_transformers_and_Smyth's_power_domains","262170263_Lambda_calculus_schemata","256554906_Ten_years_of_Hoare's_logic_A_survey-_part_II_Nondeterminism","245624208_CCS-A_Calculus_for_Communicating_Systems","245124984_A_type-theoretical_alternative_to_ISWIM","242911218_The_Relation_between_Computational_and_Denotational_Properties_for_Scott's_textD_infty_Models_of_the_Lambda-Calculus","242631494_Register_transfer_systems_and_their_behaviour","242530237_The_formal_definition_of_algol_60","242530176_On_the_formal_description_of_PLI","242527978_Verification_of_Sequential_and_Concurrent_Programs","242502451_The_Vienna_Development_Method_The_Meta-Language","242441745_Denotationalsemantics_the_scott-strachey_approach_to_programming_language_semantics","242362727_Lang_programming_environments_based_on_structured_editors_the_mentor_experience","240294732_The_Denotational_Description_of_Programming_Languages-An_Introduction","239606732_An_operational_semantics_for_CSP","239536135_Towards_a_mathematical_theory_of_computation","237131291_On_the_interpretation_of_GOTO_statements_in_the_ULD","235624822_Semantics_and_Pragmatics_of_the_Lambda-Calculus","235167392_A_Formal_Description_of_a_Subset_of_Algol","234826087_Formal_Semantics_of_Programming_Languages_VDL","234801915_Countable_nondeterminism_and_random_assignment","234794791_Correspondence_between_ALGOL_60_and_Church's_Lambda-notation_Part_I","232716956_The_Scott-Strachey_Approach_to_Programming_Language_Theory","227336284_A_cook's_tour_of_countable_nondeterminism","227295397_Dijkstra's_predicate_transformers_and_smyth's_powerdomains","225189321_Sharing_in_nondeterminism","223657338_LCF_considered_as_a_programming_language","223114345_Correct_and_optimal_implementation_of_recursion_in_a_simple_programming_language","222484891_A_type-theoretical_alternative_to_ISWIM_CUCH_OWHY","222120495_Call-by-name_call-by-value_and_the_l-calculus","221459641_A_First_Attempt_at_Translating_CSP_into_CCS","221061752_Computer_hardware_description_languages_and_their_applications","220975701_A_term_model_for_CCS","220975417_Full_Abstraction_for_a_Simple_Parallel_Programming_Language","220897701_A_Cook's_Tour_of_Countable_Nondeterminism","220833531_On_Describing_the_Behavior_and_Implementation_of_Distributed_Systems","220827132_An_operational_semantics_for_CSO","220691830_Principles_of_Programming_Languages","220690132_The_Pi-Calculus_-_a_theory_of_mobile_processes","220688100_A_Calculus_of_Communicating_System","220618408_The_Relation_Between_Computational_and_Denotational_Properties_for_Scott's_D","220617182_The_Semantics_of_Call-By-Value_and_Call-By-Name_in_a_Nondeterministic_Environment","220573307_Correct_and_Optimal_Implementations_of_Recursion_in_a_Simple_Programming_Language"]}
