{"id":"255687885_On_Certain_Topological_Indices_of_Silicate_Honeycomb_and_Hexagonal_Networks","abstract":"In the QSAR /QSPR study, physicochemical properties and topological indices such as Randić, Zagreb, and ABC index are used to predict bioactivity of the chemical compounds. Graph theory has found considerable use in Chemistry, particularly in modeling chemical structures. Topological indices are designed basically by transforming a molecular graph into a number. In this paper we calculate the Randić, Zagreb, and ABC index of Silicate, honeycomb and hexagonal networks.","authors":["Bharati Rajan","M.
