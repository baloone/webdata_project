This study exercises an analytic-mathematical approach which has been utilized three-layer artificial neural network tools, which includes one hidden layer and one output neuron and logistic regression (LR) with seven independent variable and one dependent variable for testing research’s hypotheses. Although the given results illustrates the high potential capacities of both models in the prediction of bankruptcies in an interval of three years, two years and one year before bankruptcy, capacity of neural network model showed the relative higher capability than LR model. This study takes into consideration the comparison of two popular tools of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and LR in bankruptcy prediction that are of importance in their own type.","authors":["Ali Mansouri","Arezoo Nazari","Morteza Ramazani"],"meta":["June 2016International Journal of Advanced Computer Research 6(24):81-92","DOI:10.19101/IJACR.2016.624010"],"references":["229697061_Neural_Networks_A_New_Tool_for_Predicting_Thrift_Failures","284674941_A_Bankruptcy_Classification_Model_for_Small_Firms","244959442_A_Neural_Network_Based_Clustering_Procedure_for_Bankruptcy_Prediction","243775938_Financial_Ratios_As_Predictors_of_Failure","243774279_Financial_Ratios_and_the_Probabilistic_Prediction_of_Bankruptcy","243456648_Essentials_of_Managerial_Finance","242339095_Predicting_corporate_bankruptcy_Where_we_stand","237400389_Hybrid_Neural_Network_Models_for_Bankruptcy_Predictions","227446416_Managerial_Applications_of_Neural_Networks_The_Case_of_Bank_Failure_Predictions","225371052_The_early_stages_of_financial_distress"]}
