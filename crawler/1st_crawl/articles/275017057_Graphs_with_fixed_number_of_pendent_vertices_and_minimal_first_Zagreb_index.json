{"id":"275017057_Graphs_with_fixed_number_of_pendent_vertices_and_minimal_first_Zagreb_index","abstract":"The first Zagreb index $M_1$ of a graph $G$ is equal to the sum of squares\nof degrees of the vertices of $G$. Goubko proved that for trees with $n_1$\npendent vertices, $M_1 geq 9,n_1-16$. We show how this result can be\nextended to hold for any connected graph with cyclomatic number $gamma geq 0$.\nIn addition, graphs with $n$ vertices, $n_1$ pendent vertices, cyclomatic\nnumber $gamma$, and minimal $M_1$ are characterized. Explicit expressions\nfor minimal $M_1$ are given for $gamma=0,1,2$, which directly can be extended\nfor $gamma>2$.","authors":["Ivan Gutman","Muhammad Kamran Jamil","Jamil And","Naveed Akhter"],"meta":["August 2014"],"references":["273382671_Note_on_Minimizing_Degree-Based_Topological_Indices_of_Trees_with_Given_Number_of_Pendent_Vertices","272833904_Trees_with_fixed_number_of_pendent_vertices_with_minimal_first_Zagreb_Index","267665889_Sharp_bounds_on_Zagreb_indices_of_cacti_with_k_pendant_vertices","267038607_Maximizing_the_Zagreb_Indices_of_n_m-Graphs","265086711_Probabilistic_Analysis_of_the_First_Zagreb_Index","296353326_On_the_origin_of_two_degree-based_topological_indices","273318995_Degree-based_topological_indices_Optimal_trees_with_given_number_of_pendents","272898426_Degree-Based_Topological_Indices","266221848_A_unified_approach_to_the_extremal_Zagreb_indices_for_trees_unicyclic_graphs_and_bicyclic_graphs","265350345_The_first_Zagreb_index_30_years_after"]}
