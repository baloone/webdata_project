{"id":"277541863_A_New_Academic_Vocabulary_List","abstract":"This article presents our new Academic Vocabulary List (AVL), derived from a 120-million-word academic subcorpus of the 425-million-word\nCorpus of Contemporary American English (COCA; Davies 2012). We first explore reasons why a new academic core list is warranted, and why such a list is still needed in English language\neducation. We also provide a detailed description of the large academic corpus from which the AVL was derived, as well as\nthe robust frequency and dispersion statistics used to identify the AVL. Our concluding case studies show that the AVL discriminates\nbetween academic and other materials, and that it covers âˆ¼14% of academic materials in both COCA (120 million+ words) and\nthe British National Corpus (33 million+ words). The article concludes with a discussion of how the AVL can be used in settings\nwhere academic English is the focus of instruction. In this discussion, we introduce a new web-based interface that can be\nused to learn AVL words, and to identify and interact with AVL words in any text entered in the search window.","authors":["Dee Gardner","Mark Davies"],"meta":["June 2013Applied Linguistics 35(3):305-327","DOI:10.1093/applin/amt015"],"references":["313535210_The_nature_learning_and_instruction_of_general_academic_vocabulary","293108189_Towards_a_lexical_framework_for_CLIL","283463556_Introduction_Why_Adolescent_Literacy_Matters_Now","275115134_A_Phrasal_Expressions_List","259077611_Evidence_for_the_Importance_of_Academic_Word_Knowledge_for_the_Academic_Achievement_of_Diverse_Middle_School_Students","251576188_Beware_the_range_in_RANGE_and_the_academic_in_AWL","250055403_The_Effectiveness_and_Ease_of_Implementation_of_an_Academic_Vocabulary_Intervention_for_Linguistically_Diverse_Students_in_Urban_Middle_Schools","225772230_Academic_vocabulary_and_middle_school_English_learners_An_intervention_study","5255689_Knowledge_of_Morphologically_Complex_Words_A_Developmental_Study_of_Older_Children_and_Young_Adolescents","323281503_Learning_Vocabulary_in_Another_Language","296337845_Frequency_counts_word_lists_and_materials_preparation_A_new_approach","292752889_Teaching_English_language_learners_What_the_research_does-and_does_not-say","287303385_Exploring_vocabulary_Language_in_action","285807977_The_early_catastrophe_The_30_million_word_gap_by_age_3","284543317_A_university_word_list","284482717_Metalinguistic_awareness_and_the_vocabulary-comprehension_connection","283948027_1_A_study_of_the_most_frequent_word_families_in_the_British_National_Corpus","282565942_Is_there_an_academic_vocabulary","281770916_Vocabulary_Applied_Linguistic_Perspectives","279741942_Adolescent_Literacy_Putting_the_Crisis_in_Context","271633303_A_reassessment_of_frequency_and_vocabulary_size_in_L2_vocabulary_teaching","264704874_Is_There_an_Academic_Vocabulary","264381384_A_new_Academic_Word_List","264353474_The_Academic_Word_List_10_Years_On_Research_and_Teaching_Implications","264337252_No_There_Isn't_an_'Academic_Vocabulary'_But_A_Reader_Responds_to_K_Hyland_and_P_Tse's_Is_There_an_'Academic_Vocabulary'","263599641_Creating_and_using_A_frequency_dictionary_of_Contemporary_American_English_Word_sketches_collocates_and_thematic_lists","260353845_Derivative_Word_Forms_What_Do_Learners_Know","259838627_What_Is_Academic_Vocabulary","249768563_Preparing_Word-Lists_A_Suggested_Method","249237383_Validating_the_Construct_of_Word_in_Applied_Corpus-based_Vocabulary_Research_A_Critical_Survey","243783594_Stages_of_Reading_Development","243767339_Bringing_Words_to_Life_Robust_Vocabulary_Instruction","232569747_Large_problem_spaces_The_challenge_of_vocabulary_for_English_language_learners","229863977_The_Percentage_of_Words_Known_in_a_Text_and_Reading_Comprehension","228564731_An_Academic_Formulas_List_New_Methods_in_Phraseology_Research","228529436_Learning_about_language_and_learners_from_computer_programs","227762410_Words_as_Tools_Learning_Academic_Vocabulary_as_Language_Acquisition","227729099_The_Learning_and_Use_of_Academic_English_Words","222345476_Through_the_looking_glass_and_into_the_land_of_lexico-grammar"]}
