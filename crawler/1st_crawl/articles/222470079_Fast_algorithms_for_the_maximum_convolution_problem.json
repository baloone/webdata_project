{"id":"222470079_Fast_algorithms_for_the_maximum_convolution_problem","abstract":"We describe two algorithms for solving the maximum convolution problem, i.e. the calculation of ck: = max {ak−i + bi∥ 0 ⩽ i ⩽ n - 1} for all k with respect to given sequences (a0…, an−1), (b0,…, bn−1), of real numbers. Our first algorithm with expected running time O (n log n) is mainly of theoretical interest while our second algorithm allows a simpler, more practicable implementation and showed quite fast performance in numerical experiments.","authors":["Michael Bussieck","Hannes Hassler","Gerhard J.
