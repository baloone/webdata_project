{"id":"3810435_Clique-based_crossover_for_solving_the_timetabling_problem_with_GAs","abstract":"The article describes an investigation and its results on a new\ncrossover operator for solving the timetabling problem with genetic\nalgorithms. Since a timetabling problem can be represented as a graph\nand then manipulated as a graph colouring problem, the central feature\nbehind the approach presented here considers the presence of solved\ncliques in the mating parents. A clique is a maximally connected\nsubgraph, that is, any node in it is joined by an edge with any other\nnode of the subgraph. Although finding the clique in a graph is not an\neasy problem, in fact, it is an NP-complete type, real timetabling\nproblems usually include cliques whose sizes, in relation to the total\nsize of the problem, are still manageable. Results after experimentation\nwith several test files show that the approach and its variations is\nadvantageous under certain circumstances. The reasons why this is\nhappening are explained. Also the ways that, despite the results, this\nresearch can lead to answering other interesting questions are outlined","authors":["Hugo Terashima-Marín","Peter Ross","Manuel Valenzuela-Rendón"],"meta":["February 1999","DOI:10.1109/CEC.1999.782572","SourceIEEE Xplore","Conference: Evolutionary Computation, 1999.
