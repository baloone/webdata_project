{"id":"338696632_Connectivism_and_leadership_harnessing_a_learning_theory_for_the_digital_age_to_redefine_leadership_in_the_twenty-first_century","abstract":"This manuscript provides a literature review of connectivism. It presents evidence and thinking in which connectivism, a new learning theory which has typically been used for online learning, is applied to leadership, with a provocative discussion on the yet unexplored opportunities to use connectivism to redefine leadership in the twenty-first century. The paper aims to bridge the gap between the contributions of digital learning in education and the field of leadership theory and development. It seeks to apply the critical tenants of connectivism in education and learning to leadership theory and to stimulate a debate on new forms of leadership.","authors":["Frederique Corbett","Elio Spinello"],"meta":["January 2020Heliyon 6(1):e03250","DOI:10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e03250","Project: Connectivism"],"references":["282017068_MOOCs_A_Systematic_Study_of_the_Published_Literature_2008-2012","334524360_Educational_Research_Quantitative_Qualitative_and_Mixed_Approaches","324304382_The_Human_Side_of_Enterprise","318661773_Information_Literacy_Instruction","317953505_Situated_learning_Legitimate_peripheral_participation","317443926_A_Scholar-Practitioner_Perspective_on_a_Leadership_Development_Program_in_Health_Care_Integrating_Connectivism_Theory","301737088_Connectivism_A_knowledge_learning_theory_for_the_digital_age","289577727_Building_Your_Library_Career_with_Web_20","287112426_Vygotsky's_sociocultural_theory_and_contributions_to_the_development_of_constructivist_curricula","274769370_Vygotsky_and_Education_Instructional_Implications_and_Applications_of_Sociohistorical_Psychology"]}
