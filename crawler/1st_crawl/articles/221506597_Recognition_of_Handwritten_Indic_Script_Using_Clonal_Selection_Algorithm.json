{"id":"221506597_Recognition_of_Handwritten_Indic_Script_Using_Clonal_Selection_Algorithm","abstract":"The work explores the potentiality of a clonal sel ection algorithm in pattern recognition (PR). In particular, a retraini ng scheme for the clonal selection algorithm is formulated for better recogn ition of handwritten numerals (a 10-class classification problem). Empirical stud y with two datasets (each of which contains about 12,000 handwritten samples for 10 numerals) shows that the proposed approach exhibits very good generaliza tion ability. Experimental results reported the average recognition accuracy o f about 96%. The effect of control parameters on the performance of the algori thm is analyzed and the scope for further improvement in recognition accura cy is discussed.","authors":["Utpal Garain","Mangal P.
