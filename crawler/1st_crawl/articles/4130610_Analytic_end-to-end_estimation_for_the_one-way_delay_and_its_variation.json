{"id":"4130610_Analytic_end-to-end_estimation_for_the_one-way_delay_and_its_variation","abstract":"Delay estimation is a difficult problem in computer networks. RTT (round trip time) is often used as an approximation of the delay, but because it is a sum of the forward and reverse delays, the actual one-way delay cannot he estimated accurately from RTT. Accurate one-way delay estimation becomes crucial because it serves a very important role in network and application design. This paper proposes a new scheme to estimate one-way delay and its variation. The scheme calibrates estimated one-way delay so in a brief duration as to be used in many protocols that adjust their behavior depending on the network condition. We analytically derive one-way delay, forward and reverse delay respectively, and show that our one-way delay estimation is much more accurate than RTT estimation by simulation.","authors":["Jin-Hee Choi","Chuck Yoo"],"meta":["February 2005","DOI:10.1109/CCNC.2005.1405228","SourceIEEE Xplore","Conference: Consumer Communications and Networking Conference, 2005.
