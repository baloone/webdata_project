{"id":"280164469_MIT_Scratch_A_Powerful_Tool_for_Improving_Teaching_of_Programming","abstract":"Programming has been taught for many years to High School students in Greece. Despite this fact, the results are poor. Many students find programming boring and difficult. In contrast, using of computers in students' everyday life is very popular. Most of the students use the Internet, the Social Media and the computer games in a very effective way. MIT Scratch has been proposed as a solution to this educational problem. In this paper we attempt to investigate whether this is true.","authors":["Stefanos Nikiforos","C Kontomaris","K Chorianopoulos"],"meta":["October 2013","Conference: CIE2013At: Athens"],"references":["265797241_New_frameworks_for_studying_and_assessing_the_development_of_computational_thinking","262368012_Introducing_Secondary_Education_Students_to_Algorithms_and_Programming","236985838_How_students_estimate_the_effects_of_ICT_and_programming_courses","221537160_Programming_by_Choice_Urban_Youth_Learning_Programming_with_Scratch","221536990_Developing_a_validated_assessment_of_fundamental_CS1_concepts","220383062_FEATURE_Empowering_kids_to_create_and_share_programmable_media","296944914_Selected_Styles_in_Web-Based_Educational_Research","279824051_The_sharing_of_wonderful_ideas_influence_and_interaction_in_Online_Communities_of_Creators","270960149_Research_Methods_In_Education","239065730_QUALITATIVE_RESEARCH_ISSUES_AND_METHODS_AN_INTRODUCTION_FOR_EDUCATIONAL_TECHNOLOGISTS"]}
