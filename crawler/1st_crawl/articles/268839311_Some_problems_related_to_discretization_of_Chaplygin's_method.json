{"id":"268839311_Some_problems_related_to_discretization_of_Chaplygin's_method","abstract":"Abstract. Three problems connected to practical application of Chaplygin’s method (two-sided approximations based on differenntial inequalities) are considered. These are: the choice initial approximations, the examination of convexity and the finding of the next approximations. These problems are analysed during discretization of Chaplygin’s method. The error estimate is also considered.","authors":["Dušan Tošić"],"meta":["January 1983Matematicki Vesnik 35","Project: Numerical solution of ordinary differential equations"],"references":[]}
