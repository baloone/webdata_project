{"id":"220427690_Is_abstraction_the_key_to_computing","abstract":"Some recommendations for the future work of abstraction, and its role in computing are presented. Abstraction is important in computer science and software engineering, and involves identification of critical aspects of the environment and the required system. The generalization aspect of abstraction is seen in the programming with the use of data abstractions and object-oriented programming. Abstract analysis for program analysis is another example of generalization, where the concrete program domain is mapped to an abstract domain to capture the semantics of the computation of the program analysis. Abstraction skills are essential in the construction of appropriate models, designs and implementation, fit for the particular purpose, and analysis of the programs in a programming language. Abstraction is a fundamental to mathematics and engineering, playing a important part in the production of models and sound engineering solutions.","authors":["Jeff Kramer"],"meta":["April 2007Communications of the ACM 50(4):36-42","DOI:10.1145/1232743.1232745","SourceDBLP"],"references":["274309848_Computational_Thinking","236896079_Concurrency_State_Models_Java_Programs","248926662_From_Webster's_Third_New_International_Dictionary","248283065_The_Psychology_of_The_Child","242625839_Why_universities_require_compute_science_students_to_take_math","232973892_Educational_Psychology_in_Teacher_Education","232429918_The_Development_of_Formal_Operations_in_Logical_and_Moral_Judgments","227152862_Revealing_the_Faces_of_Abstraction","226201914_Reducing_Abstraction_Level_When_Learning_Abstract_Algebra_Concepts","220694985_Fundamentals_of_Software_Engineering"]}
