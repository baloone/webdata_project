{"id":"314939796_The_Needs_of_Interdisciplinary_Research","abstract":"We begin this chapter by outlining a set of interdisciplinary information needs derived from our discussion in Chap. 1. We then discuss each of these in turn. We close the chapter by discussing how disciplinary scholars would be affected by the adoption of KOSs that met interdisciplinary needs.","authors":["Rick Szostak","Claudio Gnoli","María José López"],"meta":["March 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-30148-8_2","In book: Interdisciplinary Knowledge Organization"],"references":["275030582_A_Pragmatic_Semeiotic_Perspective_on_the_Concept_of_Information_Need_and_Its_Relevance_for_Knowledge_Organization","265943503_Wittgensteinian_Support_for_Domain_Analysis_in_Classification","262902220_Classifications_and_concepts_Towards_an_elementary_theory_of_knowledge_interaction","262536324_The_Blind_Men_and_the_Elephant_Towards_an_Organization_of_Epistemic_Contexts","260675265_Decision_Making_in_Interdisciplinary_Studies","242415720_Progress_in_synthetic_classification_towards_unique_definition_of_concepts","242073835_How_to_Do_Interdisciplinarity_Integrating_the_Debate","242024249_A_substantive_theory_of_classification_for_information_retrieval","241699607_Is_classification_necessary_after_Google","228960525_Freely_faceted_classification_for_a_Web-based_bibliographic_archive_the_BioAcoustic_Reference_Database","228849388_Actors_Domains_and_Constraints_in_the_Design_and_Construction_of_Controlled_Vocabularies","228661409_Visualizing_the_Semantic_Web","326079251_Classifying_the_Humanities","321594970_Classifying_Science_Phenomena_Data_Theory_Method_Practice","316791718_Work_at_the_Boundaries_of_Science","297691991_Specifying_Intersystem_Relations_Requirements_Strategies_and_Issues","291863268_Categories_and_relators_A_new_schema","291086711_Classifying_Relationships","290280465_Skepticism_and_knowledge_organization","289751570_The_basic_concepts_classification","289134836_Classification_Transcends_Library_Business","289134835_Universal_and_domain-specific_classifications_from_an_interdisciplinary_perspective","287254311_The_causes_of_economic_growth_Interdisciplinary_perspectives","286481942_Relationships_in_Knowledge_Organization","281007535_Categories_and_relators_A_new_schema","279549196_Learning_about_the_Information_Seeking_of_Interdisciplinary_Scholars_and_Students","277668452_An_Enquiry_Concerning_Human_Understanding","271749915_Four_Views_of_a_Novel_Characteristics_of_Novels_as_Described_by_Publishers_Librarians_Literary_Theorists_and_Readers","270329017_Contemporary_Sociological_Theory_Continuing_the_Classical_Tradition","269748922_Crossing_Boundaries_Knowledge_Disciplinarities_and_Interdisciplinarities","264360753_Reducing_Subject_Tree_Browsing_Complexity_In_Press","263335566_Plugging_the_whole_Librarians_as_interdisciplinary_facilitators","261628973_Introduction_to_Information_Science_and_Technology","256600139_Philosophical_Investigations_Oxford","256410873_Methods_for_Transdisciplinary_Research_A_Primer_for_Practice","256326781_Beyond_Common_Ground_A_Transdisciplinary_Approach_to_Interdisciplinary_Communication_and_Collaboration","248440949_Why_indexing_fails_the_researcher","248294904_Philosophical_Investigations_trans_GEM_Anscombe","246390598_How_Libraries_Cope_with_Interdisciplinarity_The_Case_of_Women's_Studies","241730083_Classification_Adopt_Adapt_or_Create_A_Discussion_Point","239063722_On_the_problem_of_aboutness_in_document_analysis","236815012_Why_trade","235734949_The_Effects_of_Car_Traffic_on_Breeding_Bird_Populations_in_Woodland_I_Evidence_of_Reduced_Habitat_Quality_for_Willow_Warblers_Phylloscopus_trochilus_Breeding_Close_to_a_Highway","235305227_Some_thoughts_on_classification_for_retrieval","235274977_'Facets'_as_interdisciplinary_undiscovered_public_knowledge_SR_Ranganathan_in_India_and_L_Guttman_in_Israel","234425121_Introduction_-_The_science_and_technology_of_NDE","233086876_Multilingual_Subject_Access_The_Linking_Approach_of_MACS","220590097_Freely_faceted_classification_for_Web-based_information_retrieval","220435727_The_scatter_of_documents_over_databases_in_different_subject_domains_How_many_databases_are_needed","220041532_Crossing_Boundaries_Knowledge_Disciplinarities_and_Interdisciplinarities","37715815_Interdisciplinarity_History_Theory_and_Practice","37692909_Image_Logic_A_Material_Culture_of_Microphysics","32961637_Information_Work_at_the_Boundaries_of_Science_Linking_Library_Services_to_Research_Practices","32961632_Meeting_the_Information_Needs_of_Interdisciplinary_Scholars_Issues_for_Administrators_of_Large_University_Libraries","32958373_How_We_Construct_Subjects_A_Feminist_Analysis"]}
