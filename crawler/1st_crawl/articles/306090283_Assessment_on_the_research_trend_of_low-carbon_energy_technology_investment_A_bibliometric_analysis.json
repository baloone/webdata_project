{"id":"306090283_Assessment_on_the_research_trend_of_low-carbon_energy_technology_investment_A_bibliometric_analysis","abstract":"Based on databases of Science Citation Index Expanded (1981-present) and Social Sciences Citation Index (2002-present), this paper applies the bibliometric method to analyze the scientific publications of low-carbon energy technology investment. By characterizing the basic information of the publications, we found: the historical development process is clearly divided into two stages; the field of low-carbon energy technology investment has entered a stage of rapid development; the strength of developed countries is far greater than that of developing countries; the comprehensive strength of the United States ranks the first in the field, followed by UK and Denmark and only China and Turkey are developing countries among the top 15 countries; the auctorial collaboration degree in this field shows a clear upward trend, but institutional and national collaboration degrees are steady and relatively low. In addition, distributions of geography, journals and subjects, productive authors and institutions, frequently cited articles, etc. are obtained: articles in this area are mainly distributed in the USA, several countries in Europe and China; the most productive journal, author and institution are Energy Policy, Lund H from Denmark and National Technical University of Athens in Greece; Energy Fuel is the most popular subject among all the outcomes; the most frequently cited article is written by Demirbas published in Energy Policy in 2007. According to the frequency analysis of keywords, it reveals that: “renewable energy” is a kind of keyword used most frequently; “carbon capture and storage technology” is an emerging keyword which is increasingly concerned about; scholars pay widespread attention to electricity issues, especially the feed-in tariff; the policy mainly includes energy policy and climate policy; the real option theory is the most widely used theory; the existing uncertainty is summarized as the cost uncertainty and policy uncertainty. In the end, several suggestions for the future research are given.","authors":["Hao Yu","Yi-Ming Wei","Bao-Jun Tang","Zhifu Mi"],"meta":["August 2016Applied Energy
