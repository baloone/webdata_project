{"id":"336700927_Modeling_measuring_and_using_BRDFs_significant_French_contributions","abstract":"The scattering of light by a surface is described by the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF). Unfortunately, this function cannot be straightforwardly acquired or modeled. French researchers have proposed interesting contributions to the field, with several models and accurate experimental systems. For instance, the National Metrological Institute (LNE-CNAM) has implemented the best angular resolution goniospectrophotometer (0.015°). Modeling the BRDF has also been deeply studied in France, especially with the microfacet theory in recent years, a better understanding of the shadowing–masking function, new general distribution functions, visible normals, interfaced Lambertian microfacets, and analysis concerning light multiple reflections. This paper presents the state of the art regarding some significant French contributions in these fields.","authors":["Lionel Simonot","Gael Obein","Benjamin Bringier","Daniel Meneveaux"],"meta":["November 2019Journal of the Optical Society of America A 36(11):C40","DOI:10.1364/JOSAA.36.000C40"],"references":["334721459_Quand_la_matiere_diffuse_la_lumiere","332145066_Reflectance_computation_for_a_specular_only_V-cavity","331204788_Reflectance_Computation_for_a_Specular_Only_V-Cavity_7th_International_Workshop_CCIW_2019_Chiba_Japan_March_27-29_2019_Proceedings","329272643_An_adaptive_parameterization_for_efficient_material_acquisition_and_rendering","328514778_A_microfacet-based_BRDF_for_the_accurate_and_efficient_rendering_of_high-definition_specular_normal_maps","345665904_Diffraction_Removal_in_an_Image-based_BRDF_Measurement_Setup","334046497_Microfacet_BSDFs_Generated_from_NDFs_and_Explicit_Microgeometry","326729867_The_layer_laboratory_A_calculus_for_additive_and_subtractive_composition_of_anisotropic_surface_reflectance","325921255_A_Composite_BRDF_Model_for_Hazy_Gloss","325556825_Efficient_Rendering_of_Layered_Materials_using_an_Atomic_Decomposition_with_Statistical_Operators"]}
