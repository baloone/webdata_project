{"id":"318163587_Lattice_Logic_Properly_Displayed","abstract":"We introduce a proper display calculus for (non-distributive) Lattice Logic which is sound, complete, conservative, and enjoys cut-elimination and subformula property. Properness (i.e. closure under uniform substitution of all parametric parts in rules) is the main interest and added value of the present proposal, and allows for the smoothest Belnap-style proof of cut-elimination, and for the most comprehensive account of axiomatic extensions and expansions of Lattice Logic in a single overarching framework. Our proposal builds on an algebraic and order-theoretic analysis of the semantic environment of lattice logic, and applies the guidelines of the multi-type methodology in the design of display calculi.","authors":["Giuseppe Greco","Alessandra Palmigiano"],"meta":["June 2017","DOI:10.1007/978-3-662-55386-2_11","Conference: International Workshop on Logic, Language, Information, and Computation","Projects: The logics of categories, concepts, theories, and informational entropyalgebraic proof theory"],"references":["311737322_Lattice_Logic_Properly_Displayed","310124453_Linear_Logic_Properly_Displayed","308320810_Multi-type_Sequent_Calculi","305988713_Unified_Correspondence_as_a_Proof-Theoretic_Tool","305908493_Categories_How_I_Learned_to_Stop_Worrying_and_Love_Two_Sorts","301837337_Constructive_Canonicity_of_Inductive_Inequalities","301837325_Sahlqvist_via_Translation","301836196_Constructive_canonicity_for_lattice-based_fixed_point_logics","285877894_Multi-type_Display_Calculus_for_Dynamic_Epistemic_Logic","285275763_A_Proof-Theoretic_Semantic_Analysis_of_Dynamic_Epistemic_Logic","281424186_Jonsson-style_canonicity_for_ALBA-inequalities","274788799_Multi-type_Display_Calculus_for_Propositional_Dynamic_Logic","265127941_Canonicity_results_for_mu-calculi_An_algorithmic_approach","264623835_Dual_characterizations_for_finite_lattices_via_correspondence_theory_for_monotone_modal_logic","255712223_A_Course_in_Universal_Algebra","235626321_Residuated_Lattices_an_algebraic_glimpse_at_substructural_logics","225666320_Display_Logic","38355368_Linear_logic_displayed","344552720_Basic_Proof_Theory","332384587_Algorithmic_correspondence_and_canonicity_for_non-distributive_logics","323707969_The_Mathematics_of_Sentence_Structure","318237628_Constructive_Canonicity_for_Lattice-Based_Fixed_Point_Logics","318130913_Multi-type_Display_Calculus_for_Semi_De_Morgan_Logic","305908562_A_Multi-type_Calculus_for_Inquisitive_Logic","301846946_Sahlqvist_theory_for_impossible_worlds","301818312_Unified_Correspondence_and_Proof_Theory_for_Strict_Implication","300169419_Unified_Correspondence","295683831_Power_and_Limits_of_Structural_Display_Rules","291768720_A_useful_four-valued_logic","283986715_Canonicity_and_Relativized_Canonicity_via_Pseudo-Correspondence_an_Application_of_ALBA","283889157_On_Sahlqvist_theory_for_hybrid_logics","269728144_Algorithmic_correspondence_for_intuitionistic_modal_mu-calculus","268311537_Displaying_Modal_Logic","266980290_Dynamic_Epistemic_Logic_Displayed","266690512_n-distributivity_and_some_questions_of_the_equational_theory_of_lattices","265536201_Substructural_Logics_A_Primer","265423403_Algebraic_modal_correspondence_Sahlqvist_and_beyond","250765174_Heterogeneous_Algebras","242917619_Sequent-Systems_and_Groupoid_Models_I","241855244_Basic_Proof_Theory","239064158_Life_in_the_undistributed_middle","238719836_The_Collected_Papers_of_Gerard_Gentzen","230876238_The_Mathematics_of_Sentence_Structure","226338622_Semantic_Analysis_of_Orthologic","221942985_Linear_Logic","220691917_Introduction_to_Lattices_and_Order_2nd_ed","220394663_Algorithmic_correspondence_and_canonicity_for_distributive_modal_logic","220300159_Logical_Constants_as_Punctuation_Marks","220173689_Proof_systems_for_lattice_theory","213879545_Introduction_to_Lattice_and_Order"]}
