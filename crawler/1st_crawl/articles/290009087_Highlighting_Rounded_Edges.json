{"id":"290009087_Highlighting_Rounded_Edges","abstract":"This paper proposes an efficient method for rendering highlights on rounded edges, which is important for photorealism and comprehensibility. The rounded edges are shaded as thin cylinders separately from the planar surfaces. To ensure coherence with the planar surfaces, an edge shading equation is proposed, which derives an appropriate edge shading model from any conventional model. The final image is obtained by drawing edges like wire-frames onto the planar surface image. Using this method, aliasing-free edge highlights can be generated from simple edge data with little increase in computation cost.","authors":["Takafumi Saito","Mikio Shinya","Tokiichiro Takahashi"],"meta":["January 1989","DOI:10.1007/978-4-431-68093-2_40","In book: New Advances in Computer Graphics (pp.613-629)"],"references":["3045712_Continuous_Shading_of_Curved_Surfaces","242608697_Rendering_techniques_for_transparent_objects","242373779_Illumination_for_Computer_Generated_Pictures","242362912_From_wire-frame_to_furry_animals","239535817_An_interactive_rendering_system_with_shading","234792073_Model_of_Light_Reflection_for_Computer_Synthesized_Pictures","234791241_Summed-Area_Tables_for_Texture_Mapping","220184534_Stochastic_Sampling_in_Computer_Graphics","3210321_Realism_in_Computer_Graphics_A_Survey"]}
