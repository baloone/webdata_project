{"id":"275605693_New_concepts_of_fuzzy_planar_graph","abstract":"Fuzzy planar graph is an important subclass of fuzzy graph. Fuzzy planar graphs and its several properties are presented. A very close association of fuzzy planar graph is fuzzy dual graph. This is also defined and several properties of it are studied. Isomorphism on fuzzy graphs are well defined in literature. Isomorphic relation between fuzzy planar graph and its dual graph are established.","authors":["Sovan Samanta","Anita Pal","Madhumangal Pal"],"meta":["January 2014International Journal of Advanced Research in Artificial Intelligence 3(1)","DOI:10.14569/IJARAI.2014.030108"],"references":["312092976_FUZZY_DUAL_GRAPH","301851029_Irregular_Bipolar_Fuzzy_Graphs","277075943_A_New_Approach_to_Social_Networks_Based_on_Fuzzy_Graphs","267961207_Fuzzy_Effective_Distance_K-Dominating_sets_and_their_applications","264348087_Some_More_Results_on_Bipolar_Fuzzy_Sets_and_Bipolar_Fuzzy_Intersection_Graphs","264219167_63_Isomorphism_on_Fuzzy_Graphs","260712518_Strongest_Strong_Cycles_and_-Fuzzy_Graphs","283157319_Bipolar_fuzzy_graphs","268550632_Fuzzy_graphs","265629445_Fuzzy_graphs_and_fuzzy_hypergraphs"]}
