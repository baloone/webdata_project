{"id":"312196553_Value_Oriented_Big_Data_Strategy_Analysis_Case_Study","abstract":"Big data is emerging in recent years as an evolutionary phenomenon. Many new concepts and business models driven by data are introduced as a result. We in this research are motivated to investigate the value side of big data. We examine the financial statements in CAC40 companies in order to discover the relationship between stock performance and depth of corporate data involvement. Our results are surprisingly two-folded. There are companies with strong data capability that succeed in the stock market. There are also companies without much data depth that also perform well. Moreover, the result doesn’t show link between the not-well performed companies and the lack of data capability. To decode this surprising result, we reexamine the existing strategic big data literature and discover the missing puzzle pieces. We thus propose a new strategic model that considers both supply chain decision dynamics and data capability. We explain this model based on an airline industry’s case study. We draw managerial implications to conclude this paper.","authors":["Wei Zhou","Jonathan Arcondara","Khaled Himmi","Peiqing Guan"],"meta":["January 2017","DOI:10.24251/HICSS.2017.124","Conference: Proceedings of the 50th Hawaii International Conference on System SciencesAt: Hawaii","Project: Big Data & Business Analytics"],"references":["262880066_Recent_advances_and_trends_in_predictive_manufacturing_systems_in_big_data_environment","338698437_Obtaining_Value_from_Big_Data_for_Service_Delivery","313439163_A_process_oriented_framework_for_assessing_the_business_value_of_information_technology","306154155_How_Smart_Connected_Products_are_Transforming_Companies","304535150_Big_data_The_management_revolution","288941678_Are_you_ready_for_the_era_of_'big_data'","284679162_Business_Intelligence_and_Analytics_From_Big_Data_to_Big_Impact","284611187_Big_Data_Analytics_and_the_Path_From_Insights_to_Value","264340780_Data_Science_Predictive_Analytics_and_Big_Data_A_Revolution_That_Will_Transform_Supply_Chain_Design_and_Management","261562559_Data_Quality_for_Data_Science_Predictive_Analytics_and_Big_Data_in_Supply_Chain_Management_An_Introduction_to_the_Problem_and_Suggestions_for_Research_and_Applications","235313551_Supply_Chain_Management_Integration_and_Implementation","228554643_Performance_Metrics_in_Supply_Chain_Management","227446993_Information_Distortion_in_a_Supply_Chain_The_Bullwhip_Effect","257015955_Leveraging_the_capabilities_of_service-oriented_decision_support_systems_Putting_analytics_and_big_data_in_cloud","220079536_E-Commerce_Metrics_for_Net-Enhanced_Organizations_Assessing_the_Value_of_E-Commerce_to_Firm_Performance_in_the_Manufacturing_Sector"]}
