{"id":"282765879_More_Results_on_Vague_Graphs","abstract":"The main purpose of this paper is to show the rationality of some operations, defined or to be defined, on vague graphs. Three kinds of new product operations (called direct product, lexicographic product, and strong\nproduct) of vague graphs are defined, and rationality of these notions and some defined important notions on vague graphs, such as vague graph, vague complete graph, Cartesian product of vague graphs and union of vague graphs are demonstrated by characterizing these notions by their level counterparts graphs.","authors":["Hossein Rashmanlou","Rajabali Borzooei"],"meta":["January 2015UPB Scientific Bulletin, Series A: Applied Mathematics and Physics 78(1)"],"references":["259692489_Vague_hypergraphs","283157319_Bipolar_fuzzy_graphs","248390639_Graphs_with_Given_Group_and_Given_Graph_Theoretical_Properties","235943829_Vague_Sets","225510417_Interval-valued_fuzzy_line_graphs","223593669_Zadeh_LA_Similarity_Relations_and_Fuzzy_Orderings_Information_Sciences_3_177-200","222583500_Burillo_P_Vague_sets_are_intuitionistic_fuzzy_sets_Fuzzy_Sets_Syst_793_403-405","222439366_Fuzzy_Sets","220511052_Combination_of_interval-valued_fuzzy_set_and_soft_set"]}
