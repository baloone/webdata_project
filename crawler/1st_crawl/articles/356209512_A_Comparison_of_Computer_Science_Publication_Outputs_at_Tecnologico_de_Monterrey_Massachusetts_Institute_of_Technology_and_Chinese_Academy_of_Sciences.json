And in this work, it is compared with two other institutions-the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which are distinguished in the area of computer science-in order to find similarities, differences, and patterns in their research performance. That is done by collecting data, such as the number of publications, citations, views, and others, obtained from SciVal, which is a tool to access information of research institutions, researches and their publications. The comparison is being done over these data, and their respective analysis and results are reported here.","authors":["Leonardo F. Garrafa-Pacheco"],"meta":["November 2021"],"references":[]}
