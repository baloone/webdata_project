{"id":"341222479_Detection-Localization-Identification_of_Vibrations_over_Long_Distance_SSMF_with_Coherent_Delta-Phi-OTDR","abstract":"We propose a novel interrogation technique for Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) and demonstrate the detection and recognition of multiple vibration events over 50km of SSMF. A differential-phase optical time-domain reflectometry (Delta-Phi-OTDR) approach is used. At the transmitter side, a continuous ultra-narrow-linewidth laser is modulated with polarization-multiplexed orthogonal binary sequences and at the receiver side, the back-scattered signal is captured through a polarization-diversity coherent mixer in a self-homodyne configuration. The detection of the full optical field vector and the use of an ultra-narrow-linewidth laser source enhance the sensitivity of the interrogating solution. A comparison of the experimental results to a simulation model is developed to better understand the noise limits. A low-complexity localization technique based on a multi-resolution approach is also presented. Major results include the identification of an engine noise, paving the way for numerous smart-city/industrial monitoring applications over deployed telecom fibers.","authors":["Elie Awwad","Christian Dorize","Sterenn Guerrier","Jeremie Renaudier"],"meta":["May 2020Journal of Lightwave Technology PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/JLT.2020.2993167","Project: Optical fiber sensing"],"references":["323276947_Enhancing_performance_of_coherent_OTDR_systems_with_polarization_diversity_complementary_codes","281240913_Fundamentals_of_Optical_Fiber_Sensing_Schemes_Based_on_Coherent_Optical_Time_Domain_Reflectometry_Signal_Model_Under_Static_Fiber_Conditions","335895388_High_Sensitivity_v-OTDR_over_Long_Distance_with_Polarization_Multiplexed_Codes","334350734_A_Dual-polarization_Rayleigh_Backscatter_Model_for_Phasesensitive_OTDR_Applications","334332280_Efficient_Multi-Event_Localization_from_Rayleigh_Backscattering_in_Phase-Sensitive_OTDR_Systems","332519863_First_Field_Trial_of_Sensing_Vehicle_Speed_Density_and_Road_Conditions_by_Using_Fiber_Carrying_High_Speed_Data","325777654_Ultrastable_laser_interferometry_for_earthquake_detection_with_terrestrial_and_submarine_cables","317037158_An_Introduction_to_Distributed_Optical_Fibre_Sensors","308549192_Real_time_dynamic_strain_monitoring_of_optical_links_using_the_backreflection_of_live_PSK_data","301599477_Long-Range_Distributed_Vibration_Sensing_Based_on_Phase_Extraction_from_Phase-Sensitive_OTDR"]}
