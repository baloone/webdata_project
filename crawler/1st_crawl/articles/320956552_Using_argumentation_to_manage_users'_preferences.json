{"id":"320956552_Using_argumentation_to_manage_users'_preferences","abstract":"Argumentation has provided a means to deal with inconsistent knowledge. We explore the potential of argumentation to handle conflicting user preferences. Classical preference handling methods in Artificial Intelligence (AI) lack the ability to handle ambiguity and the evolution of preferences over time. Previous experiments conducted by the authors indicate the usefulness of argumentation systems to handle Ambient Intelligence (AmI) examples with the aforementioned characteristics.\nThis paper explores a generalized framework that can be applied to handle user preferences in AmI. The paper provides an overall preference handling architecture which can be used to extend current argumentation systems. We show how the proposed system can handle multiple users with the introduction of personalized preference functions. We illustrate how user preferences can be handled in realistic ways in AmI environments (such as smart homes), by showing how the system can make decisions based on inhabitants’ preferences on lighting, healthy eating and leisure.","authors":["Chimezie Leonard Oguego","Juan Carlos Augusto Wrede","Andrés Muñoz","Mark Springett"],"meta":["November 2017Future Generation Computer Systems","DOI:10.1016/j.future.2017.09.040","Projects: Preferences within Intelligent Environment SystemsHolistic development of emerging applications in heterogeneous systems (HETEROLISTIC)Ambient Intelligence"],"references":["270793368_Intelligent_Environments_a_manifesto","265794982_A_quantitative_preference-based_structured_argumentation_system_for_decision_support","228957697_Computing_Generalized_Specificity","222452074_A_Mathematical_Treatment_of_Defeasible_Reasoning_and_Its_Implementation","221562005_Learning_about_preferences_and_common_behaviours_of_the_user_in_an_intelligent_environment","221539936_Interest-based_Preference_Reasoning","221404866_UCP-Networks_A_Directed_Graphical_Representation_of_Conditional_Utilities","221393435_Revision_of_an_Argumentation_System","221292854_Arguing_about_Preferences_and_Decisions","220637607_The_Logical_Approach_to_Temporal_Reasoning","220607764_Computational_Representation_of_Practical_Argument","220604823_Preference_Handling_for_Artificial_Intelligence","220283852_Temporal_Defeasible_Reasoning","220072522_Defeasible_Contextual_Reasoning_with_Arguments_in_Ambient_Intelligence","42792646_Using_Argumentation_Logic_for_Firewall_Policy_Specification_and_Analysis","313467518_Computing_generalized_specificity","287625920_Introducing_ontological_CP-nets","284667394_Instants_and_intervals","283480815_Resolving_conflicts_in_knowledge_for_ambient_intelligence","280078800_Logical_models_of_argument","247931462_Logic_for_Computer_Science_Foundations_of_Automatic_Theorem_Proving","237051821_Argumentation-Based_Qualitative_Preference_Modelling_with_Incomplete_and_Uncertain_Information","235976813_Handbook_of_Ambient_Assisted_Living_Technology_for_Healthcare_Rehabilitation_and_Well-Being","234802798_Human-centered_systems","222669660_Using_argumentation_to_model_and_deploy_agent-based_B2B_applications","221587803_QoS-based_Late-Binding_of_Service_Invocations_in_Adaptive_Business_Processes","221539009_A_Logical_Framework_for_Modelling_Legal_Argument","221053607_Developing_an_Intelligent_Parking_Management_Application_Based_on_Multi-agent_Systems_and_Semantic_Web_Technologies","220907772_An_Argumentation-Based_Approach_to_Multiple_Criteria_Decision","220605600_Preference_Handling_-_An_Introductory_Tutorial","220546843_Towards_a_General_Theory_of_Action_and_Time"]}
