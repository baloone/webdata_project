{"id":"328502557_Cooperative_load_transportation_using_multiple_UAVs","abstract":"The aim of this paper is cooperative task assignment to multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) for load transportation. The main goal is to transport a slung load safely with minimal swing. To this end, for each UAV, which is regarded as an agent, a distributed controller is proposed. The proposed controller guarantees a fixed formation, which in turn achieves the main objective. A model of the system is obtained using the Udwadiaâ€“Kalaba method for an arbitrary number of UAVs and one slung load with ropes. This method leads to a novel multi-agent system model with interactions between neighbor and non-neighbor agents. The control law is then proposed based on sub-optimal LQR-PID for the extended system. Simulation results are presented to verify the ability of the proposed method to keep the formation of the agents, and to guide the load in the desired direction.","authors":["Behzad Shirani","Majdeddin Najafi","Iman Izadi"],"meta":["October 2018Aerospace Science and Technology","DOI:10.1016/j.ast.2018.10.027"],"references":["314192628_Nonlinear_Control_with_Swing_Damping_of_a_Multirotor_UAV_with_Suspended_Load","313229352_Nonlinear_controller_design_for_a_helicopter_with_an_external_slung_load_system","304049024_Flocking_in_Fixed_and_Switching_Networks","264458706_Modeling_and_Control_of_a_Helicopter_Slung-Load_System","263059381_An_Alternate_Proof_for_the_Equation_of_Motion_for_Constrained_Mechanical_Systems","245307260_Equations_of_Motion_for_Mechanical_Systems","224153221_Cooperative_Load_Transport_A_Formation-Control_Perspective","37439805_Design_and_Control_of_quadrotors_with_application_to_autonomous_flying","352532636_Cooperative_Grasping_and_Transport_Using_Multiple_Quadrotors","323175994_Survey_of_Flocking_Algorithms_in_Multi-agent_Systems","314023095_Model_predictive_control_for_a_multi-body_slung-load_system","313454077_Geometric_Control_of_Quadrotor_UAVs_Transporting_a_Cable-Suspended_Rigid_Body","305312145_Dynamic_modeling_of_a_high-speed_over-constrained_press_machine","286338707_Team_cooperation_in_a_network_of_multi-vehicle_unmanned_systems_Synthesis_of_consensus_algorithms","271479473_Distributed_Leader-Following_Swarm_of_Heterogeneous_Multi-Agent_Systems","269065380_Dynamics_of_a_helicopter_with_a_sling_load","264902556_Cooperative_Control_of_Multi-Agent_Systems_Optimal_and_Adaptive_Design_Approaches","263452490_A_tutorial_on_linear_and_bilinear_matrix_inequalities","245322609_An_optimal_cooperation_in_a_team_of_agents_subject_to_partial_information","238184650_Stabilization_of_Baumgarte's_Method_Using_the_Runge-Kutta_Approach","236278920_UAV_Flight_formation_control","225521797_Multi-UAV_Cooperation_and_Control_for_Load_Transportation_and_Deployment","223539533_Stabilization_of_Constraints_and_Integrals_of_Motion_in_Dynamical_Systems","222939650_A_stabilization_algorithm_for_a_class_of_uncertain_linear_systems","220122264_Planning_and_Control_for_Cooperative_Manipulation_and_Transportation_with_Aerial_Robots","27254489_Mathematical_modelling_of_helicopter_slung-load_systems","3023762_Linear_Matrix_Inequalities_Riccati_Equations_and_Indefinite_Stochastic_Linear_Quadratic_Controls"]}
