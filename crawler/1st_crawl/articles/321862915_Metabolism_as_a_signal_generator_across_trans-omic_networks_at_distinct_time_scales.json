{"id":"321862915_Metabolism_as_a_signal_generator_across_trans-omic_networks_at_distinct_time_scales","abstract":"Metabolism not only involves outcomes of signal transduction, gene expression, and chromatin/DNA modification but also serves as a signal generator across omic layers. Metabolic signals emerge from interplay of biochemical interactions across different omic layers denoted the trans-omic network. Importantly, metabolic signals selectively use distinct time scales inherent to each omic layer and coordinately control cellular homeostasis. Recent advances in comprehensive measurement technologies allow identification of metabolism-centric trans-omic networks. Here we review the roles of metabolism as a generator of signals that circulates trans-omic network in distinct time scales, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis in higher organisms.","authors":["Katsuyuki Yugi","Shinya Kuroda"],"meta":["December
