{"id":"318501255_Muslim_perspectives_on_spiritual_and_religious_travel_beyond_Hajj_Toward_understanding_motivations_for_Umrah_travel_in_Oman","abstract":"For decades, religious tourism has played a major part in attracting travellers to sacred sites for the performance of rituals. Within the Muslim World, there are two types of religious-related travel: Hajj and non-Hajj. This paper takes a quantitative survey-based approach to explore Muslim pilgrim travel motives beyond the Hajj season. Umrah is a pilgrimage that Muslims undertake at any time of the year except during the time of Hajj. Thankfulness to a higher power (Allah in Islam) is revealed as the main reason for undertaking Umrah. Other useful findings related to the most important daily spiritual/religious practices and the perceived spiritual/religious beliefs for Omani Umrah travellers are reported. This article opens up new perspectives on non-Hajj travel of Muslim pilgrims and discusses the implications and future research directions for this cohort of travellers.","authors":["Hamed Mohammed Almuhrzi","Abdulaziz Alsawafi"],"meta":["July 2017Tourism Management Perspectives 24","DOI:10.1016/j.tmp.2017.07.016"],"references":["326840875_The_business_of_hajj","274316928_A_Model_of_Spirituality_for_Ageing_Muslims","256487218_The_Varieties_of_the_Spiritual_Tourist_Experience","248993688_The_religious_the_plural_the_secular_and_the_modern_A_brief_critical_survey_on_Islam_in_Malaysia","248499578_Toward_a_Social_Psychological_Theory_of_Tourism_Motivation_A_Rejoinder","247896704_Fathering_Faith_and_Spirituality","247753548_Affect_Travel_Motivation_and_Travel_Intention_a_Senior_Market","233523178_Religious_Influences_on_Shopping_Behaviour_An_Exploratory_Study","232829395_Does_Nationality_Gender_or_Age_Affect_Travel_Motivation_A_Case_of_Visitors_to_the_Caribbean_Island_of_Barbados","228372585_Applying_Ansoff's_growth_strategy_matrix_to_consumer_segments_and_typologies_in_spiritual_tourism","220438123_Islam_and_Online_Imagery_on_Malaysian_Tourist_Destination_Websites","305330437_Branding_Islamic_spiritual_tourism_an_exploratory_study_in_Australia_and_Pakistan","298055385_A_study_of_spirituality_in_the_workplace","284265312_Chapter_10_Islamic_tourism_in_Jordan","279496343_Marketing_Mysticism_and_the_Purchase_of_Pilgrimage_The_Rise_of_Spiritual_Tourism_in_Cusco_and_Iquitos_Peru","278396257_Taoism_temples_and_tourists_The_case_of_Mazu_pilgrimage_tourism","266417584_EXPLORING_MOTIVATION_AND_TOURIST_TYPOLOGY_THE_CASE_OF_KOREAN_GOLF_TOURISTS_TRAVELLING_IN_THE_ASIA_PACIFIC","256487224_Spiritual_Tourism_Travel_and_Religious_Practice_in_Western_Society","254192057_Managing_customer_experience_for_spiritual_and_cultural_tourism_An_overview","249057502_Non-Hajj_Pilgrimage_in_Islam_A_Neglected_Dimension_of_Religious_Circulation","248500193_Female_professionals_in_the_Japanese_tourism_industry","247231073_The_preference_analysis_for_tourist_choice_of_destination_A_case_study_of_Taiwan","241745876_Islamic_tourism_as_an_ideological_construction_A_Jordan_study_case","237272537_Exploring_Consumer_Segments_and_Typologies_of_Relevance_to_Spiritual_Tourism","236810267_Assessing_Students'_Spiritual_and_Religious_Qualities","235260256_The_Effects_of_Religious_Factors_on_Perceived_Risk_in_Durable_Goods_Purchase_Decisions","233220668_Spiritual_journey_to_Hajj_Australian_and_Pakistani_experience_and_expectations","232865122_Motives_and_Patterns_of_Family_Reunion_Travel","229507649_Islamic_Tourism_and_Managing_Tourism_Development_in_Islamic_Societies_The_Cases_of_Iran_and_Saudi_Arabia","228009323_Tourism_A_Sacred_Journey_The_Case_of_Ashram_Tourism_India","227917216_Visitor_motivation_satisfaction_and_behavioural_intention_The_2005_Naadam_Festival_Ulaanbaatar","227681665_Travel_Motivations_of_Tourists_to_Selected_Marine_Destinations","222322883_Pilgrimage_growth_in_the_modern_world_Meanings_and_implications","41371087_The_motivations_constraints_and_decision-making_of_Beijing_outbound_tourists","37377084_Cross-cultural_research_issues_in_developing_international_tourist_markets_for_cultural_events"]}
