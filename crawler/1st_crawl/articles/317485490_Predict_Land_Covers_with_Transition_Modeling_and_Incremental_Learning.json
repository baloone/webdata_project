{"id":"317485490_Predict_Land_Covers_with_Transition_Modeling_and_Incremental_Learning","abstract":"Successful land cover prediction can provide promising insights in the applications where manual labeling is extremely difficult. However, traditional machine learning models are plagued by temporal variation and noisy features when directly applied to land cover prediction. Moreover, these models cannot take fully advantage of the spatio-temporal relationship involved in land cover transitions. In this paper, we propose a novel spatio-temporal framework to discover the transitions among land covers and at the same time conduct classification at each time step. Based on the proposed model, we incrementally update the model parameters in the prediction process, thus to mitigate the impact of the temporal variation. Our experiments in two challenging land cover applications demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over multiple baselines. In addition, we show the efficacy of spatio-temporal transition modeling and incremental learning through extensive analysis.","authors":["Xiaowei Jia","Ankush Khandelwal","Guruprasad Nayak","James Gerber"],"meta":["June 2017","DOI:10.1137/1.9781611974973.20","Conference: SIAM International Conference on Data Mining"],"references":["304029484_Learning_a_Transferable_Change_Rule_from_a_Recurrent_Neural_Network_for_Land_Cover_Change_Detection","277918764_Phenology-Based_Vegetation_Index_Differencing_for_Mapping_of_Rubber_Plantations_Using_Landsat_OLI_Data","258529161_High-Resolution_Global_Maps_of_21st-Century_Forest_Cover_Change","314405692_Stacks_of_convolutional_Restricted_Boltzmann_Machines_for_shift-invariant_feature_learning","313451501_Learning_large-scale_plantation_mapping_from_imperfect_annotators","312210566_Principal_Component_Analysis","310809780_Collaborative_restricted_Boltzmann_machine_for_social_event_recommendation","309081329_A_Survey_on_Context_Learning","304288776_DRN_Bringing_Greedy_Layer-Wise_Training_into_Time_Dimension","303847202_Monitoring_Land-Cover_Changes_A_Machine-Learning_Perspective"]}
