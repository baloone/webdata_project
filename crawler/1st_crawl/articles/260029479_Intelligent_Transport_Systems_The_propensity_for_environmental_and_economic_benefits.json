{"id":"260029479_Intelligent_Transport_Systems_The_propensity_for_environmental_and_economic_benefits","abstract":"Whilst the economic and efficiency benefits of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) are well established, the goal of this research is to demonstrate the simultaneous propensity for low carbon benefits through the deployment of ITS. The foundation of this paper is therefore that the deployment of these technology measures contributes to the positive-sum game of both economic and environmental sustainability. Two research questions are addressed: firstly whether the evidence supports the notion that ITS systems can be implemented and operated in such a way to generate environmental benefits; and secondly whether policy priorities amongst national and international stakeholders reflect a propensity for ITS deployment in order to yield those benefits. The first question is addressed using a rationale based upon both underlying drivers and a synthesis of the empirical evidence. The second is addressed by the development of novel propensity models using primary research on international stakeholders' perceptions of ITS as a priority solution to deliver climate and environmental goals. The research shows that Vehicle Density and High Technology exports were found to be significant variables in determining the propensity for ITS to feature as a high priority policy tool in future transport strategies. The research holds further value in positioning ITS as a policy tool able to deliver both economic and sustainability gains. It holds relevance for both policy analysts and transport strategists at international, national and regional tiers.","authors":["Susan Grant-Muller","Mark Usher"],"meta":["February 2014Technological Forecasting and Social Change 82(1):149â€“166","DOI:10.1016/j.techfore.2013.06.010"],"references":["283355036_Impacts_of_ICTs_on_Transport_and_Mobility_ICTRANS","266480125_Review_and_analysis_of_the_reduction_potential_and_costs_of_technological_and_other_measures_to_reduce_CO_2_-emissions_from_passenger_cars","251670723_Using_AHP_and_Dempster-Shafer_theory_for_evaluating_sustainable_transport_solutions","240529224_Smarter_Choices_Assessing_the_Potential_to_Achieve_Traffic_Reduction_Using_'Soft_Measures'","233285789_Identification_of_new_added_value_services_on_intelligent_transportation_systems","227968583_Regional_governance_in_England_a_changing_role_for_the_Government's_regional_offices","224892390_Regional_governance_in_England_Past_experience_future_directions","223719019_Is_the_transport_system_becoming_ubiquitous_Socio-technical_roadmapping_as_a_tool_for_integrating_the_development_of_transport_policies_and_intelligent_transport_systems_and_services_in_Finland","223489671_The_application_of_information_and_communication_technologies_in_transport","223020139_The_governance_of_transport_and_climate_change","46559823_Sociopsychological_Perspectives_on_the_Active_Roles_of_Domestic_Actors_in_Transition_to_a_Lower_Carbon_Electricity_Economy","316225786_Transport_Policy_in_Britain","287033527_Transport_Policy_and_Planning_in_Great_Britain","283410159_Stepwise_logistic_regression_Applied_logistic_regression","274911459_The_Informational_City_Information_Technology_Economic_Restructuring_and_the_Urban-Regional_Process","270877704_Applied_Logistical_Regression","269398881_Traffic_Jam_Ten_Years_of_'Sustainable'_Transport_in_the_UK","265681805_Categorical_Data_Analysis","261238019_Numerical_Simulation_on_the_Interfacical_Creep_Failure_of_Dissimilar_Welded_Joint_between_T91_and_G102_Heat-Resistant_Steels","256684296_The_Economics_of_Climate_Change_The_Stern_Review","252027185_A_method_to_estimate_the_spatial_distribution_of_transport_carbon_emissions_in_Shanghai","248987301_An_assessment_of_advanced_transport_telematics_evaluation_procedures","248690256_Rethinking_Sustainable_Cities_Multilevel_Governance_and_the_'Urban'_Politics_of_Climate_Change","248497863_Transition_through_Subsystem_Innovation_The_Case_of_Traffic_Management","248452884_Assessing_the_potential_impact_of_climate_change_on_transportation_The_need_for_an_interdisciplinary_approach","241190254_Study_on_Value_of_Low-Carbon_Economy_of_e-Commerce","240529211_Impact_of_information_and_communications_technology_on_transport","239278349_Looking_Back_and_Thinking_Ahead_A_Decade_of_Cities_and_Climate_Change_Research","234063536_ITS_Solutions_and_Accident_Risks_Prospective_and_Limitations","233327536_Governing_environmental_innovations","233144641_The_nonpolitics_of_managing_low_carbon_socio-technical_regimes","233107872_Strategic_niche_management_and_sustainable_innovation_journeys_Theory_findings_research_agenda_and_policy","228921996_The_impact_of_climate_change_and_weather_on_transport_An_overview_of_empirical_findings","227735101_Priorities_policies_and_timescales_The_delivery_of_emissions_reductions_in_the_UK_transport_sector","227464491_The_Double_Bubble_at_the_Turn_of_the_Century_Technological_Roots_and_Structural_Implications","225368165_Design_and_Evaluation_of_Road_Pricing_State-of-the-Art_and_Methodological_Advances","224793595_The_Changing_Allocation_of_Activities_in_Space_and_Time_by_the_Use_of_ICT_-_Fragmentation_as_a_New_Concept_and_Empirical_Results","223741745_Policy_integration_What_will_it_take_to_achieve_more_sustainable_transport_solutions_in_cities","223678967_'Devolution'_of_transport_powers_to_Local_Government_Impacts_of_the_2004_Traffic_Management_Act_in_England","223596887_Energy_and_emissions_impacts_of_a_freeway-based_dynamic_eco-driving_system","223397637_Information-Communications_Technologies_ICT_and_transport_Does_knowledge_underpin_policy","223287692_Comprehensive_analysis_of_the_carbon_impacts_of_vehicle_intelligent_speed_control","223059247_Workplace_Travel_Plans_Past_Present_and_Future","222762966_Transport_and_Climate_Change_A_Review","222696748_Exploring_sustainability_transitions_in_the_electricity_sector_with_socio-technical_pathways","222641151_Can_cities_shape_socio-technical_transitions_and_how_would_we_know_if_they_were","222533409_Technological_transitions_as_evolutionary_reconfiguration_processes_A_multi-level_perspective_and_a_case-study","222201330_Processes_and_patterns_in_transitions_and_system_innovations_Refining_the_co-evolutionary_multi-level_perspective","221992061_Eco-driving_An_overlooked_climate_change_initiative","46560004_Divergence_or_Convergence_Devolution_and_Transport_Policy_in_the_United_Kingdom"]}
