The study of\nflower classification is an important aspect in computer\nscience due to its aggregate impact in the human life from\nbotany, science, medical etc., but due to it complex\nenvironment for extracting features, similarity of features in\nmany species, changing features in the life of a flower having\netc. An accurate classification is considered as a novel work\nsince many classification algorithms are still newly presented.\nThis paper presents a comparative study of different t flower\nimage segmentation and classification algorithms containing\ntheir experiment dataset and the result accuracy rate to assist\nfuture researchers in this domain.","authors":["Afraa Alshammari"],"meta":["February 2018International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering"],"references":["317405930_Toward_automatic_quality_detection_of_Jasmenum_flower","318574943_Inception-v3_for_flower_classification","312562134_Flower_classification_via_convolutional_neural_network","221551861_Automated_Flower_Classification_over_a_Large_Number_of_Classes","4247710_A_New_Method_for_Image_Classification_by_Using_Multilevel_Association_Rules"]}
