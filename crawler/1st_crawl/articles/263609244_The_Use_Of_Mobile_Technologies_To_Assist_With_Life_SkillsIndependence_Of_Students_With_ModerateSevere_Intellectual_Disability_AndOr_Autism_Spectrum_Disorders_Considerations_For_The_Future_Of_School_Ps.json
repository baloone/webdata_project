The proliferation of advanced mobile technologies specifically targeting individuals with moderate to severe intellectual disability and/or autism spectrum disorder means increased access to new tools and a greater need for educational service providers to be trained and ready to identify, recommend and deploy appropriate supports. The rapid rate of change in the technology industry is a formidable barrier to adequately preparing anyone except a technology specialist to be current on the latest advances. This article presents recommendations for school psychologists in terms of becoming familiar with the generally available technologies and the underlying instructional techniques rather than any specific technology products. Complete familiarity with all emergent technologies is improbable but through understanding the general ways technology can be used and the basic instructional practices, school psychologists will be better equipped to recommend further exploration of technological solutions for students.","authors":["Kevin Ayres","Linda Mechling","Frank J.
