{"id":"265288419_Role_Playing_in_Online_Education_A_Teaching_Tool_to_Enhance_Student_Engagement_and_Sustained_Learning","abstract":"Discovering new ways to inspire students is a worthy teaching goal. When students love what they are learning, the process feels meaningful, they retain the information better, and the experience motivates them to learn more. Encouraging a love of learning can be a particular challenge in an online class, however, since the teacher does not see the students face-to-face and therefore lacks the visual cues that typically indicate how much students understand, what excites them, and what they still need to know. As online education escalates, it is important for instructors to explore teaching techniques that engage students and enhance learning at a profound level. To achieve this goal, instructors must look at the primarily text-based environment of the online class not as a limitation, but as an opportunity. Attentive and highly personal teaching that generates enthusiastic interaction, collaboration, and engaged dialogue among students is desirable in any educational setting. But it is all the more crucial in an online classroom, for it enables teachers to gain knowledge of their students that would not otherwise be available within such an environment. Role playing is one specific online activity that can contribute to a successful and highly enjoyable learning experience. By providing opportunities for students to create and participate in role-playing scenarios, instructors can gain a sounder knowledge of each student, and students can benefit through increased interaction with the material and with each other.","authors":["Tisha Bender"],"meta":["April 2011"],"references":["270584995_Knowing_What_Students_Know_The_Science_and_Design_of_Educational_Assessment","201381775_Experience_And_Education"]}
