{"id":"316465997_On_the_bivariate_permanent_polynomials_of_graphs","abstract":"In 1980, Balasubramanian and Parthasarathy introduced the bivariate permanent polynomials of graphs and conjectured that this polynomial is a graph characterizing polynomial, that is, any two graphs with the same bivariate permanent polynomial are isomorphic. In this paper, we give counterexamples to this conjecture by a computer search. Furthermore, we show that several well-known families of graphs are determined by the bivariate permanent polynomial: complete graphs, complete bipartite graphs, regular complete multipartite graphs, cycles and their complements.","authors":["Shunyi Liu"],"meta":["April 2017Linear Algebra and its Applications 529","DOI:10.1016/j.laa.2017.04.021"],"references":["283086953_Per-spectral_and_adjacency_spectral_characterizations_of_a_complete_graph_removing_six_edges","267696172_Per-spectral_characterizations_of_some_edge-deleted_subgraphs_of_a_complete_graph","268972983_On_spectrum_and_per-spectrum_of_graphs","266979210_The_permanental_polynomials_of_certain_graphs","263688077_Characterizing_properties_of_permanental_polynomials_of_lollipop_graphs","256805376_On_the_characterizing_properties_of_the_permanental_polynomials_of_graphs","251137152_In_search_of_a_complete_invariant_for_graphs","234066554_Practical_Graph_Isomorphism_II","230596039_Matching_theory","222991400_Tutte_uniqueness_of_line_graphs","222958722_Permanental_polynomials_of_graphs","222808307_The_Complexity_of_Computing_the_Permanent","222783381_Farrell_Polynomials_on_graphs_of_bounded_tree_width","220187089_Graph_characterising_polynomials","220152192_Graphs_determined_by_polynomial_invariants"]}
