{"id":"265511876_Narrow_Proofs_May_Be_Maximally_Long","abstract":"We prove that there are 3-CNF formulas over n variables that can be refuted\nin resolution in width w but require resolution proofs of size n^Omega(w). This\nshows that the simple counting argument that any formula refutable in width w\nmust have a proof in size n^O(w) is essentially tight. Moreover, our lower\nbound generalizes to polynomial calculus resolution (PCR) and Sherali-Adams,\nimplying that the corresponding size upper bounds in terms of degree and rank\nare tight as well. Our results do not extend all the way to Lasserre, however,\nwhere the formulas we study have proofs of constant rank and size polynomial in\nboth n and w.","authors":["Albert Atserias","Massimo Lauria","Jakob Nordstr√∂m"],"meta":["September 2014Proceedings of the Annual IEEE Conference on Computational Complexity","DOI:10.1109/CCC.2014.36","SourcearXiv"],"references":["330537653_Complexity_of_Semialgebraic_Proofs","262215815_Towards_an_Understanding_of_Polynomial_Calculus_New_Separations_and_Lower_Bounds","261469505_Lower_Bounds_for_DNF-refutations_of_a_Relativized_Weak_Pigeonhole_Principle","261246896_Space_Complexity_in_Polynomial_Calculus","256079535_Linear_Lower_Bound_on_Degrees_of_Positivstellensatz_Calculus_Proofs_for_the_Parity","242371169_Cones_of_Matrices_and_Set-Functions_and_0-1_Optimization","230872913_Outline_of_an_Algorithm_for_Integer_Solutions_to_Linear_Programs","222684742_New_developments_in_the_theory_of_Grobner_bases_and_applications_to_formal_verification","221632992_Using_CSP_Look-Back_Techniques_to_Solve_Exceptionally_Hard_SAT_Instances","221498825_Short_Proofs_May_Be_Spacious_An_Optimal_Separation_of_Space_and_Length_in_Resolution","220532729_A_Hierarchy_of_Relaxations_Between_the_Continuous_and_Convex_Hull_Representations_for_Zero-One_Programming_Problems","324707399_Proofs_as_Games","313527384_Using_CSP_look-back_techniques_to_solve_real-world_SAT_instances","303571623_Parameterized_complexity_of_DPLL_search_procedures","303568359_Parameterized_Bounded-Depth_Frege_Is_not_Optimal","289830892_Total_Space_in_Resolution","282536028_A_Framework_for_Space_Complexity_in_Algebraic_Proof_Systems","268637008_Proofs_as_Games","268018664_On_the_complexity_of_propositional_calculus","265764648_Some_trade-off_results_for_polynomial_calculus","262346503_Pseudo-partitions_transversality_and_locality_A_combinatorial_characterization_for_the_space_measure_in_algebraic_proof_systems","259764749_Clause-Learning_Algorithms_with_Many_Restarts_and_Bounded-Width_Resolution","258374140_Communication_Lower_Bounds_via_Critical_Block_Sensitivity","252239678_Complexity_of_Null-and_Positivstellensatz_Proofs","242855762_Structured_Semidenite_Programs_and_Semialgebraic_Geometry_Methods_in_Robustness_and_Optimization","239542839_Canonical_expressions_in_boolean_algebra","233282306_Approximability_and_proof_complexity","232637066_Lower_Bounds_for_Polynomial_Calculus_Non-Binomial_Case","228903659_Convex_Relaxations_and_Integrality_Gaps","226311514_Lower_Bounds_for_the_polynomial_calculus_and_the_Groebner_basis_algorithm","225264758_Parity_circuits_and_the_polynomial-time_hierarchy","225140027_Lower_Bounds_For_The_Polynomial_Calculus","225027404_Hypercontractivity_Sum-of-Squares_Proofs_and_their_Applications","224354145_Linear_Level_Lasserre_Lower_Bounds_for_Certain_k-CSPs","223577869_Space_Bounds_for_Resolution","222805511_The_intractability_of_Resolution","222757593_Linear_Lower_Bound_on_Degrees_of_Positivstellensatz_Calculus_Proofs_for_the_Parity","222677219_PolyBoRi_A_framework_for_Grobner-basis_computations_with_Boolean_polynomials","222549341_A_combinatorial_characterization_of_resolution_width","222451724_On_the_complexity_of_cutting-plane_proofs","222419630_Edmonds_polytopes_and_a_hierarchy_of_combinatorial_problems","222101184_On_the_Complexity_of_Finding_Narrow_Proofs","221590719_Using_the_Groebner_Basis_Algorithm_to_Find_Proofs_of_Unsatisfiability","221316747_An_Explicit_Exact_SDP_Relaxation_for_Nonlinear_0-1_Programs","220944502_Parameterized_Complexity_of_DPLL_Search_Procedures","220944420_Clause-Learning_Algorithms_with_Many_Restarts_and_Bounded-Width_Resolution","220617668_Lower_Bounds_for_Lovasz-Schrijver_Systems_and_Beyond_Follow_from_Multiparty_Communication_Complexity","220616536_On_Resolution_with_Clauses_of_Bounded_Size","220430535_Hard_examples_for_Resolution","220430351_Many_Hard_Examples_for_Resolution","220138751_Time-Space_Tradeoffs_in_Resolution_Superpolynomial_Lower_Bounds_for_Superlinear_Space","220138196_Short_Proofs_May_Be_Spacious_An_Optimal_Separation_of_Space_and_Length_in_Resolution","220153664_Tight_rank_lower_bounds_for_the_Sherali-Adams_proof_system","220138193_Parameterized_Bounded-Depth_Frege_Is_Not_Optimal","220138112_Lower_Bounds_for_Lovasz-Schrijver_Systems_and_Beyond_Follow_from_Multiparty_Communication_Complexity"]}
