{"id":"347869610_Local_modeling_one_size_does_not_fit_all","abstract":"This paper considers what happens when we abandon the concept that models of social processes have global application in favor of a local approach in which context or the influence of ‘place’ has an important role. A brief history of this local approach to statistical modeling is given, followed by a consideration of its ramifications for understanding societal issues. The piece concludes with future challenges and prospects in this area.","authors":["A.
