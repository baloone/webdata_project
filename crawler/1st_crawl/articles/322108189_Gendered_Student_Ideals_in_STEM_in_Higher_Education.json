{"id":"322108189_Gendered_Student_Ideals_in_STEM_in_Higher_Education","abstract":"Using the framework of feminist standpoint theory, this study explored the everyday work of undergraduate STEM students to identify STEM institutional cultural norms and standards that organize and inform the organization of everyday work for undergraduate women majoring in math and physics. Data collection and analysis focused on how the interface between undergraduate women and STEM education was organized as a matter of everyday encounters between students, faculty, and administration through their experiences inside and outside the classroom. Undergraduate participants reported challenges meeting some of the characteristics of successful math and physics students (e.g., taking risks, asking questions, putting school first) and preferred a collectivistic environment. These characteristics are evidence of a masculine STEM institution, which also creates a masculine ideal that women students are expected to meet and exacerbates their discomfort in the STEM environment.","authors":["Laura Parson","Casey Ozaki"],"meta":["December 2017NASPA Journal About Women in Higher Education 11(1):1-20","DOI:10.1080/19407882.2017.1392323"],"references":["320353627_Qualitative_research_design_An_interactive_approach","273918406_Changing_Institutional_Culture_through_Peer_Mentoring_of_Women_STEM_Faculty","273716784_Navigating_Underrepresented_STEM_Spaces_Experiences_of_Black_Women_in_US_Computing_Science_Higher_Education_Programs_Who_Actualize_Success","262959961_Beyond_Binders_Full_of_Women_NSF_ADVANCE_and_Initiatives_for_Institutional_Transformation","251085357_The_Roles_of_Perceived_Identity_Compatibility_and_Social_Support_for_Women_in_a_Single-Sex_STEM_Program_at_a_Coeducational_University","235644329_Institutional_Ethnography_A_Sociology_For_People","232541633_Gender_Differences_in_Risk_Taking_A_Meta-Analysis","232084773_Preliminary_investigation_of_instructor_effects_on_gender_gap_in_introductory_physics","232004501_Gender_Equality_in_Academia_Bad_News_from_the_Trenches_and_Some_Possible_Solutions","229743836_Unsettling_Universities'_Incongruous_Gendered_Bureaucratic_Structures_A_Case-study_Approach","227355336_Sex_and_Science_How_Professor_Gender_Perpetuates_the_Gender_Gap","225083614_Why_Do_More_Women_than_Men_Want_to_Earn_a_Four-Year_Degree_Exploring_the_Effects_of_Gender_Social_Origin_and_Social_Capital_on_Educational_Expectations","329750948_The_Feminist_Standpoint_Developing_the_Ground_for_a_Specifically_Feminist_Historical_Materialism","319395332_Feminism_and_Methodology","319034788_Classroom_Participation_and_Student-Faculty_Interactions_Does_Gender_Matter","317953571_Qualitative_inquiry_research_design_Choosing_among_five_approaches","281751053_Promoting_Risk_Taking_in_Mathematics_Classrooms_The_importance_of_Creating_a_Safe_Learning_Environment","279741791_Constructing_Women's_Status_Policy_Discourses_of_University_Women's_Commission_Reports","273313947_Learning_in_the_Field_An_Introduction_to_Qualitative_Research","267447130_The_Gendered_Society","267398296_Women_Belonging_in_the_Social_Worlds_of_Graduate_Mathematics","264646037_Computer_Science_Majors_Sex_Role_Orientation_Academic_Achievement_and_Social_Cognitive_Factors","259542904_Addressing_Underrepresentation_in_STEM_Fields_through_Undergraduate_Interventions","254300923_Getting_There_Cuando_No_Hay_Camino_When_There_Is_No_Path_Paths_to_Discovery_Testimonios_by_Chicanas_in_STEM","249773517_Book_Review_Learning_in_the_Field_An_Introduction_to_Qualitative_Research","247747249_Gendered_Contradictions_in_Organizational_Equity_Projects","246369131_Hierarchies_Jobs_Bodies_A_Theory_of_Gendered_Organizations","245815961_Critical_Ethnography_in_Educational_Research_A_Theoretical_and_Practical_Guide","242191443_Gendered_organizations_and_intersectionality_Problems_and_possibilities","240696383_The_Epistemology_of_Gendered_Organization","236790197_Quietly_Stripping_the_Pastels_The_Undergraduate_Gender_Gap","235930814_The_Coding_Manual_for_Qualitative_Research","234587175_The_Importance_of_Breaking_Set_Socialized_Cognitive_Strategies_and_the_Gender_Discrepancy_in_Mathematics","234094185_Understanding_Women's_Underrepresentation_in_Science_Technology_Engineering_and_Mathematics_The_Role_of_Social_Coping","233230525_The_Influences_of_Perceived_Identity_Compatibility_and_Social_Support_on_Women_in_Nontraditional_Fields_During_the_College_Transition","232601001_The_Gendered_Division_of_Labor_Among_STEM_Faculty_and_the_Effects_of_Critical_Mass","229842571_Standpoint_Theories_Productively_Controversial","229532231_Women's_movements_and_new_public_management_Higher_education_in_Sweden_and_England","229477548_Gendered_Organizations_Progress_and_Prospects","227602057_A_Socially_Relevant_Philosophy_of_Science_Resources_from_Standpoint_Theory's_Controversality","227254803_The_Feminist_Standpoint_Developing_the_Ground_for_a_Specifically_Feminist_Historical_Materialism","227065344_Validity_and_Qualitative_Research_An_Oxymoron","4981771_The_Homecoming_of_American_College_Women_The_Reversal_of_the_College_Gender_Gap"]}
