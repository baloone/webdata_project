{"id":"261240757_Vision-based_user_tracking_for_outdoor_augmented_reality","abstract":"This paper examines the use of vision-based localization techniques for indoor environments in outdoor environments. A new method is presented for robust data association and finding camera trajectory; based on these, a simple augmented reality game is implemented.","authors":["Gazi Erkan Bostanci","Adrian Clark","Nadia Kanwal"],"meta":["July 2012Proceedings - International Symposium on Computers and Communications","DOI:10.1109/ISCC.2012.6249356","Conference: Computers and Communications (ISCC), 2012 IEEE Symposium on"],"references":["221221123_Real-Time_Localisation_and_Mapping_with_Wearable_Active_Vision","216813780_A_Survey_of_Mobile_and_Wireless_Technologies_for_Augmented_Reality_Systems_Preprint","4334417_Ninja_on_a_Plane_Automatic_Discovery_of_Physical_Planes_for_Augmented_Reality_Using_Visual_SLAM","4246109_Real_Time_Localization_and_3D_Reconstruction","303123869_Parallel_tracking_and_mapping_for_small_AR_workspaces","224244792_StereoScan_Dense_3d_reconstruction_in_real-time","220692721_Multiple_view_geometry_in_computer_vision_2_ed","215458920_Multi-View_Geometry_in_Computer_Vision","4334429_Parallel_Tracking_and_Mapping_for_Small_AR_Workspaces","4040661_Real-time_localization_and_mapping_with_wearable_active_vision","3410908_Analysis_of_head_pose_accuracy_in_augmented_reality","3344769_Simultaneous_localization_and_mapping_Part_I"]}
