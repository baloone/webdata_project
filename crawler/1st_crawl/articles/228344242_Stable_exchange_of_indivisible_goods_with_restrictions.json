{"id":"228344242_Stable_exchange_of_indivisible_goods_with_restrictions","abstract":"We survey some stable exchange problems under different restrictions and various stability concepts. Beside describing well-known complexity results from a general point of view, we present two new theorems on the NP-hardness of some basic 3-way stable 3-way exchange problems. As a relevant application, we introduce the kidney exchange problem.","authors":["Péter Biró"],"meta":[],"references":["311344193_College_Admission_and_the_Stability_of_Marriage","266532965_The_Kidney_exchange_game","265046366_A_Study_Of_Stable_Marriage_Problems_With_Ties","256557062_On_cores_and_indivisibility","242913745_Three-Dimensional_Stabl_Matching_Problems","228552099_Stable_marriage_with_ties_and_unacceptable_partners","226324581_Computational_complexity_of_stable_partitions_with_B-preferences","223113824_Nonexistence_of_stable_threesome_matchings","223069020_Stable_marriage_and_indifference","222991790_Inapproximability_of_the_kidney_exchange_problem"]}
