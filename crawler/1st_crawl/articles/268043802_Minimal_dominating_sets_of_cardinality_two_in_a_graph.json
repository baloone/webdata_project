{"id":"268043802_Minimal_dominating_sets_of_cardinality_two_in_a_graph","abstract":"A set S ⊂ V(G) of G = (V)(G, E(G)) is a dominating set of G if every vertex in V(G) - S is adjacent to some vertex in S. S is a minimal dominating set of a graph G if S - {u} is not a dominating set for any u ∈ 65. In this note graphs having a set consisting of any pair of vertices of the graph as a minimal dominating set are characterised. This, also, settles a conjecture of Walikar et al.5. Finally, conditions for every t-vertex subset of a graph to be a minimal dominating set for t = 1, 2, ..., p are obtained extending the result of Acharya1.","authors":["S.R.
