{"id":"309577149_Physiology-Invariant_Meal_Detection_for_Type_1_Diabetes","abstract":"Background: \nFully automated artificial pancreas systems require meal detectors to supplement blood glucose level regulation, where false meal detections can cause unnecessary insulin delivery with potentially fatal consequences, and missed detections may cause the patient to experience extreme hyperglycemia. Most existing meal detectors monitor various measures of glucose rate-of-change to detect meals where varying physiology and meal content complicate balancing detector sensitivity versus specificity.\n\nMethods: \nWe developed a novel meal detector based on a minimal glucose-insulin metabolism model and show that the detector is, by design, invariant to patient-specific physiological parameters in the minimal model. Our physiological parameter-invariant (PAIN) detector achieves a near-constant false alarm rate across all individuals and is evaluated against three other major existing meal detectors on a clinical type 1 diabetes data set.\n\nResults: \nIn the clinical evaluation, the PAIN-based detector achieves an 86.9% sensitivity for an average false alarm rate of two alarms per day. In addition, for all false alarm rates, the PAIN-based detector performance is significantly better than three other existing meal detectors. In addition, the evaluation results show that the PAIN-based detector uniquely (as compared with the other meal detectors) has low variance in detection and false alarm rates across all patients, without patient-specific personalization.\n\nConclusions: \nThe PAIN-based meal detector has demonstrated better detection performance than existing meal detectors, and it has the unique strength of achieving a consistent performance across a population with varying physiology without any individual-level parameter tuning or training.","authors":["James Weimer","Sanjian Chen","Amy Peleckis","Michael R Rickels"],"meta":["October 2016Diabetes Technology & Therapeutics 18(10):616-624","DOI:10.1089/dia.2015.0266"],"references":["278789813_Meal-Detection_in_Patients_with_Type_1_Diabetes_A_New_Module_for_The_Multivariable_Adaptive_Artificial_Pancreas_Control_System","262787168_The_UVAPADOVA_type_1_diabetes_simulator_New_features","262406461_Active_actuator_fault_detection_and_diagnostics_in_HVAC_systems","51743855_Artificial_Pancreas_Past_Present_Future","47385208_Diabetes_Models_Signals_and_Control","41418833_A_Closed-Loop_Artificial_Pancreas_Using_Model_Predictive_Control_and_a_Sliding_Meal_Size_Estimator","41418826_Closed-Loop_Artificial_Pancreas_Using_Subcutaneous_Glucose_Sensing_and_Insulin_Delivery_and_a_Model_Predictive_Control_Algorithm_Preliminary_Studies_in_Padova_and_Montpellier","41418705_Safety_Constraints_in_an_Artificial_Pancreatic_Cell_An_Implementation_of_Model_Predictive_Control_with_Insulin_on_Board","38063216_Model_Predictive_Control_of_Type_1_Diabetes_An_in_Silico_Trial","24429333_In_Silico_Preclinical_Trials_A_Proof_of_Concept_in_Closed-Loop_Control_of_Type_1_Diabetes","22699697_Quantitative_Estimation_of_Insulin_Sensitivity","15051216_The_Effect_of_Long-Term_Intensified_Insulin_Treatment_on_the_Development_of_Microvascular_Complications_of_Diabetes_Mellitus","5868515_Detection_of_a_Meal_Using_Continuous_Glucose_Monitoring_Implications_for_an_artificial_-cell","303969919_Towards_Non-Invasive_Monitoring_of_Hypovolemia_in_Intensive_Care_Patients","303969399_Towards_a_Model-Based_Meal_Detector_for_Type_I_Diabetics","283010703_Robust_Monitoring_of_Hypovolemia_in_Intensive_Care_Patients_Using_Photoplethysmogram_Signals","281487982_Parameter-Invariant_Design_of_Medical_Alarms","276390607_The_Artificial_Pancreas_Where_We_Are_Where_We're_Going","269995739_Parameter-invariant_detection_of_unknown_inputs_in_networked_systems","262787188_Design_of_the_Glucose_Rate_Increase_Detector_A_Meal_Detection_Module_for_the_Health_Monitoring_System","262273448_Distributed_model-invariant_detection_of_unknown_inputs_in_networked_systems","229001035_A_closed-loop_artificial_pancreas_based_on_MPC_human-friendly_identification_and_automatic_meal_disturbance_rejection","41418827_Probabilistic_Evolving_Meal_Detection_and_Estimation_of_Meal_Total_Glucose_Appearance","38063218_Glucose_Estimation_and_Prediction_through_Meal_Responses_Using_Ambulatory_Subject_Data_for_Advisory_Mode_Model_Predictive_Control","16857595_The_Pharmacokinetics_of_Insulin_After_Continuous_Subcutaneous_Infusion_or_Bolus_Subcutaneous_Injection_in_Diabetic_Patients","15470496_Hyperglycemie_and_Microvascular_and_Macrovascular_Disease_in_Diabetes","14292059_Prediction_of_Glucose_and_Insulin_Responses_of_Normal_Subjects_after_Consuming_Mixed_Meals_Varying_in_Energy_Protein_Fat_Carbohydrate_and_GlycACmie_Index1","12480197_Models_of_subcutaneous_insulin_kinetics_A_critical_review","11762061_Stress_Hyperglycemia_and_Prognosis_of_Stroke_in_Nondiabetic_and_Diabetic_Patients_A_Systematic_Overview","7821875_The_Decline_in_Blood_Glucose_Levels_Is_Less_With_Intermittent_High-Intensity_Compared_With_Moderate_Exercise_in_Individuals_With_Type_1_Diabetes"]}
