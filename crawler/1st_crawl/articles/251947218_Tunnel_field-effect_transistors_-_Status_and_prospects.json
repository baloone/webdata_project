{"id":"251947218_Tunnel_field-effect_transistors_-_Status_and_prospects","abstract":"This paper reviews recent progress in the development of tunnel field-effect transistors (TFETs) toward achieving channel currents comparable to high performance MOSFETs at supply voltages less than 0.5 V and subthreshold swing less than 60 mV/decade, for logic applications. To enable high performance in TFETs, development of narrow bandgap III-V and graphene nanoribbon (GNR) channels is indicated. Beyond the switch, the tunnel junction could provide enhanced functionality and new ways to integrate logic and memory.","authors":["Alan Seabaugh"],"meta":["June 2010","DOI:10.1109/DRC.2010.5551883"],"references":["260361043_Integration_Process_of_Impact-Ionization_Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor_Devices_with_Tunneling_Field-Effect-Transistors_and_Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor_Field-Effect_Transistors","27240494_Performance_analysis_of_statistical_samples_of_graphene_nanoribbon_tunneling_transistors_with_line_edge_roughness","8128815_Band-to-Band_Tunneling_in_Carbon_Nanotube_Field-Effect_Transistors","3257507_Cointegration_of_In_Situ_Doped_Silicon-Carbon_Source_and_Silicon-Carbon_I-Region_in_P-Channel_Silicon_Nanowire_Impact-Ionization_Transistor","234974962_Device_physics_and_design_of_double-gate_tunneling_field-effect_transistor_by_silicon_film_thickness_optimization","224455074_Device_physics_and_design_of_germanium_tunneling_field-effect_transistor_with_source_and_drain_engineering_for_low_power_and_high_performance_applications","36824869_Introduction_to_Solid_State_Electronics","7241131_DNA_Functionalization_of_Carbon_Nanotubes_for_Ultrathin_Atomic_Layer_Deposition_of_High_k_Dielectrics_for_Nanotube_Transistors_with_60_mVDecade_Switching","3257592_Design_of_Tunneling_Field-Effect_Transistors_Using_Strained-SiliconStrained-Germanium_Type-II_Staggered_Heterojunctions"]}
