{"id":"303702828_SITS_a_solution-based_intelligent_tutoring_system_for_students'_acquisition_of_problem-solving_skills_in_computer_programming","abstract":"In learning systems and environment research, intelligent tutoring and\npersonalisation are considered the two most important factors. An Intelligent\nTutoring System can serve as an effective tool to improve problem-solving\nskills by simulating a human tutor’s actions in implementing one-to-one\nadaptive and personalised teaching. Thus, in this research, a solution-based\nintelligent tutoring system (SITS) is proposed. It benefits from Bayesian\nnetworks in managing uncertainty based on the probability theory for\nthe process of decision-making so as to aid students learn computer\nprogramming. Additionally, SITS benefits from a multi-agent system that\nemploys an automatic text-to-flowchart conversion approach to engage\nnovice programmers in flowchart development with the aim of improving\ntheir problem-solving skills. Finally, the performance of SITS is investigated\nthrough an experimental study. It is revealed that SITS is not only capable\nof boosting students’ learning interest, attitude and technology acceptance,\nbut it also helps students achieve more in terms of problem-solving activities.","authors":["Danial Hooshyar","Rodina Ahmad","Moslem Yousefi","Moein Fathi"],"meta":["June 2016Innovations in Education and Teaching International","DOI:10.1080/14703297.2016.1189346"],"references":["242764139_Handbook_of_Research_on_Educational_Communications_and_Technology_3rd_Edition","229674759_Guiding_students_to_the_right_questions_Adaptive_navigation_support_in_an_E-Learning_system_for_Java_programming","220807692_Self-efficacy_and_mental_models_in_learning_to_program","215835935_Cognitive_Tutors_Lessons_Learned","4054619_Graphical_programming_A_vehicle_for_teaching_computer_problem_solving","315611174_Applying_an_Online_Game-based_Formative_Assessment_in_a_Flowchart-based_Intelligent_Tutoring_System_for_Improving_Problem-Solving_Skills","290628811_The_PHP_Intelligent_Tutoring_System","260790396_Developmental_Process_Model_for_the_Java_Intelligent_Tutoring_System","233448106_The_effects_of_Web-basednon-Web-based_problem-solving_instruction_and_highlow_achievement_on_students'_problem-solving_ability_and_biology_achievement","227527296_The_Efficacy_of_a_World-Wide_Web_Mediated_Formative_Assessment","225423101_The_Impact_of_Learner's_Prior_Knowledge_on_Their_Use_of_Chemistry_Computer_Simulations_A_Case_Study","222410392_A_blended_E-learning_experience_in_a_course_of_object_oriented_programming_fundamentals","220545771_Understanding_and_Debugging_Novice_Programs_ABSTRACT","220017449_The_2_Sigma_Problem_The_Search_for_Methods_of_Group_Instruction_as_Effective_as_One-to-One_Tutoring","3296956_Constructing_the_dependency_structure_of_a_multiagent_probabilistic_network"]}
