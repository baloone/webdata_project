{"id":"278828881_Reversibility_in_the_higher-order_p-calculus","abstract":"The notion of reversible computation is attracting increasing interest because of its applications in diverse fields, in particular the study of programming abstractions for reliable systems. In this paper, we continue the study un-dertaken by Danos and Krivine on reversible CCS by defining a reversible higher-order π-calculus, called rhoπ. We prove that reversibility in our cal-culus is causally consistent and that the causal information used to support reversibility in rhoπ is consistent with the one used in the causal semantics of the π-calculus developed by Boreale and Sangiorgi. Finally, we show that one can faithfully encode rhoπ into a variant of higher-order π, substantially improving on the result we obtained in the conference version of this paper.","authors":["Ivan Lanese","Claudio Antares Mezzina","Jean-Bernard Stefani"],"meta":["June 2014Theoretical Computer Science 625","DOI:10.1016/j.tcs.2016.02.019"],"references":["280752222_Causal-Consistent_Reversible_Debugging","261157289_A_Compositional_Semantics_for_the_Reversible_p-Calculus","257642501_Reversible_Irreversible_and_Optimal_l-machines","250939295_Normal_Bisimulations_in_Calculi_with_Passivation","228796126_Reversible_Communicating_Concurrent_Systems","225779952_Compositional_Event_Structure_Semantics_for_the_Internal_p-Calculus","222666756_Formal_Molecular_Biology_done_in_CCS","222158710_A_Virtual_Machine_for_Supporting_Reversible_Probabilistic_Guarded_Command_Languages","221440250_An_Injective_Language_for_Reversible_Computation","221137733_Bidirectional_Transformations_A_Cross-Discipline_Perspective","312628416_Logical_reversibility_of_computation","308808921_Causal-Consistent_Reversibility_in_a_Tuple-Based_Language","305263053_IGOR_A_System_for_Program_Debugging_via_Reversible_Execution","292449098_Expressing_mobility_in_process_algebras_first-order_and_higher-order_paradigms","287135226_Irreversibility_and_heat_generation_in_the_computing_process","283364215_A_Reversible_Process_Calculus_and_the_Modelling_of_the_ERK_Signalling_Pathway","274904300_On_Language","267007047_The_lambda_calculus_Its_syntax_and_semantics_Rev_ed","265398522_Machines_de_Turing_reversibles_Recursive_insolubilite_en_nN_de_l'equation_uth_n_u_ou_th_est_un'isomorphisme_de_codes'","262234832_Event_Structure_Semantics_of_Parallel_Extrusion_in_the_Pi-Calculus","261861460_Towards_a_Reversible_Functional_Language","261858451_Reversibility_and_Asymmetric_Conflict_in_Event_Structures","257285786_Proving_Nondeterministically_Specified_Safety_Properties_Using_Progress_Measures","255673009_Forward_and_Backward_Simulations_Part_I_Untimed_Systems","250798363_Compositional_Event_Structure_Semantics_for_the_p-Calculus","246740767_Machines_de_Turing_R'eversible","242790113_An_algebraic_interpretation_of_the_lbK-calculus_and_an_application_of_a_labelled_l-calculus","242449567_The_reexive_chemical_abstract_machine_and_the_joincalculus","242435377_The_Lambda_Calculus_Its_Syntax_and_Semantics","234832226_From_l_to_p_or_Rediscovering_continuations","234810198_EXDAMS_extendable_debugging_and_monitoring_system","233765921_A_Reversible_Abstract_Machine_and_Its_Space_Overhead","226356938_Functions_as_processes","225706662_Inverse_computation_and_the_Universal_Resolving_Algorithm","225531609_Generic_Forward_and_Backward_Simulations","225174035_Principles_of_Inverse_Computation_and_the_Universal_Resolving_Algorithm","224104463_Logical_Reversibility_of_Computation","223111140_Forward_and_Backward_Simulations_II_Timing-Based_Systems","222832745_A_Structural_Approach_to_Reversible_Computation","222745053_Reversible_Irreversible_and_Optimal_l-machines","222497790_Non-interleaving_semantics_for_mobile_processes","221621820_The_Join_Calculus_A_Language_for_Distributed_Mobile_Programming","221496102_Failboxes_Provably_Safe_Exception_Handling","221236497_Bisimulation_in_Higher-Order_Process_Calculi","221218680_Reversible_structures","221151049_Principles_of_a_reversible_programming_language","221150951_Introduction_to_reversible_computing_Motivation_progress_and_challenges","220997969_The_M-calculus_A_higher-order_distributed_process_calculus","220989929_A_reversible_programming_language_and_its_invertible_self-interpreter","220897886_Reversible_Flowchart_Languages_and_the_Structured_Reversible_Program_Theorem","220762648_Igor_A_System_for_Program_Debugging_via_Reversible_Execution","220700934_Reversible_Communicating_Systems","220700801_Back_and_Forth_Bisimulations","220751844_Efficient_algorithms_for_bidirectional_debugging","220700991_Reversing_Higher-Order_Pi"]}
