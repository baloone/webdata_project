{"id":"263316523_The_combinatorial-motivic_nature_of_mathbbF_1-schemes","abstract":"We review Deitmar's theory of monoidal schemes to start with, and have a\ndetailed look at the standard examples. It is explained how one can\ncombinatorially study such schemes through a generalization of graph theory. In\na more general setting we then introduce the author's version of\n$\\mathbb{F}_1$-schemes (called $\\Upsilon$-schemes here), after which we study\nGrothendieck's motives in some detail in order to pass to \"absolute motives\".\nThroughout several considerations about absolute zeta functions are written. In\na final part of the chapter, we describe the approach of Connes and Consani to\nunderstand the ad`ele class space through hyperring extension theory, in which\na marvelous connection is revealed with certain group actions on projective\nspaces, and brand new results in the latter context are described. Many\nquestions are posed, conjectures are stated and speculations are made.","authors":["Koen Thas"],"meta":["June 2014","SourcearXiv"],"references":["243064602_Sharply_Transitive_Linear_Groups_Over_Algebraically_Closed_Fields","227222633_Motivic_decomposition_of_projective_homogeneous_varieties_and_the_Krull-Schmidt_theorem","51978792_The_geometry_of_blueprints_Part_II_Tits-Weyl_models_of_algebraicgroups","38337507_Motivic_decomposition_of_isotropic_projective_homogeneous_varieties","315214687_A_note_on_difference_sets","302924268_The_motive_of_an_abelian_variety","288262600_Cyclic_projective_planes","285197497_Projective_geometries_as_multigroups","284702711_The_complete_enumeration_of_finite_groups_of_the_form_Ri2_RiRjkij_1","268243933_Multiple_zeta_functions_An_example","267069920_Order_in_building_theory","266982415_A_course_on_elation_quadrangles","265453573_Chow_groups_with_coefficients","265427522_F1-schemes_and_toric_varieties","265427306_Toric_Singularities","265373147_Sur_les_analogues_algebriques_des_groupes_semi-simples_complexes","265358528_Cohomology_of_relative_cellular_spaces_and_isotropic_flag_varieties","263620174_Hyperfield_extensions_characteristic_one_and_the_Connes-Consani_plane_connection","256277894_Sur_la_trialite_et_certains_groupes_qui_s'en_deduisent","246873867_Motivic_L-functions_and_regularized_determinants","246224857_Formule_de_Lefschetz_et_rationalit'e_des_fonctions_L","243763693_A_Theorem_in_Finite_Projective_Geometry_and_Some_Applications_to_Number_Theory","243111364_Motivic_decomposition_of_abelian_schemes_and_the_Fourier_transform","242357620_Les_varietes_sur_le_corpsa_unelement","241008810_Projektive_Rume_mit_einer_kommutativen_transitiven_Kollineationsgruppe","226336843_On_the_G-factors_attached_to_motives","226044419_LocalL-factors_of_motives_and_regularized_determinants","223499739_The_hyperring_of_adele_classes","48210475_Congruence_schemes","44538033_Hodge_cycles_motives_and_Shimura_varieties_Pierre_Deligne_et_al","44475642_Buildings_of_spherical_type_and_finite_BN-pairs_Jacques_Tits","39473138_Finite_projective_planes_Fermat_curves_and_Gaussian_periods","38386834_Zeta_functions_of_categories","38339437_Zeta_functions_over_mathbfF_1","38336161_Cyclic_projective_planes","2128039_Remarks_on_zeta_functions_and_K-theory_over_F1","2112024_Schemes_over_F_1"]}
