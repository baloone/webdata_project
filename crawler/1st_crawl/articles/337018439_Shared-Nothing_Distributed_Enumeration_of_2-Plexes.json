{"id":"337018439_Shared-Nothing_Distributed_Enumeration_of_2-Plexes","abstract":"We present a novel approach for the detection of 2-plexes, a popular relaxation of cliques used for modeling network communities. Specifically, with the purpose of identifying theoretically sound methods for community detection on a large scale, we introduce the first shared-nothing distributed algorithm for this problem. This result opens a new research direction for scalable community detection. Our proposal has three main ingredients: (i) we reduce the problem of finding 2-plexes to that of finding cliques; (ii) we leverage known algorithms for fast computation of cliques; (iii) we exploit a decomposition technique for a distributed shared-nothing computation. Preliminary experiments on a 10-nodes cluster running Spark confirm the effectiveness of our approach.","authors":["Alessio Conte","Donatella Firmani","Maurizio Patrignani","Riccardo Torlone"],"meta":["November 2019","DOI:10.1145/3357384.3358083","Conference: the 28th ACM International Conference"],"references":["326496506_D2K_Scalable_Community_Detection_in_Massive_Networks_via_Small-Diameter_k-Plexes","303496669_Finding_All_Maximal_Cliques_in_Very_Large_Social_Networks","254464200_Fast_algorithms_for_maximal_clique_enumeration_with_limited_memory","233251812_A_graph-theoretic_generalization_of_the_clique_concept","318915539_Fast_Enumeration_of_Large_k-Plexes","313061622_Finding_all_cliques_of_an_undirected_graph_algorithm_457","306191193_Clique_relaxation_models_in_social_network_analysis","300590376_Efficient_Enumeration_of_Maximal_k-Plexes","262241326_Denser_than_the_densest_subgraph_Extracting_optimal_quasi-cliques_with_quality_guarantees","249216536_A_Parallel_Algorithm_for_Enumerating_All_the_Maximal_k_-Plexes"]}
