{"id":"323024744_Exploring_Digital_Conversation_Corpora_with_Process_Mining","abstract":"Understanding how sentences constitute conversations is still a matter of disagreement. The automatic analysis of corpora can bring new perspectives on this issue. We show that process mining, a computer science approach for analysing human behaviour, enables the inductive identification of within-turn regularities in digital conversations. We use speech acts as a way to discretise conversations and enable the analysis. To this end, we develop a fine-grained, corpus-independent classification of speech acts that we describe and validate. We perform a manual sentence-by-sentence multi-label contextual annotation of a corpus of digital conversations and we explore it with process mining. Our results suggest that speech act theory could be extended to include typicality conditions for sequences of utterances.","authors":["Dario Compagno","Elena V Epure","Rébecca Deneckère","Camille Salinesi"],"meta":["June 2018Corpus Pragmatics 2(5)","DOI:10.1007/s41701-018-0030-6"],"references":["319391803_Computer-Mediated_Communication_and_Conversation_Analysis","314083998_Computer-Mediated_Communication_and_Conversation_Analysis","294816822_Speech_act_annotation","346643730_On_Searle_on_Conversation_Compiled_and_introduced_by_Herman_Parret_and_Jef_Verschueren","324627362_Problemes_de_linguistique_generale","323321456_How_to_Do_Things_with_Words","320022230_Conversation_Analysis","318136732_Analyzing_Perceived_Intentions_of_Public_Health-Related_Communication_on_Twitter","313559027_Conversation","294819910_Speech_acts_A_synchronic_perspective","291007307_Cognition_and_narrativity_in_speech_act_sequences","287319977_From_utterances_to_speech_acts","286041292_Conversation","286033808_Speech_Acts_Effects_and_Responses","285929877_The_Handbook_of_Conversation_Analysis"]}
