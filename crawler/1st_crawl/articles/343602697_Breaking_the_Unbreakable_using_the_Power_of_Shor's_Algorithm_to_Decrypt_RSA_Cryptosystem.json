Shor's quantum algorithm is very important for cryptography, since it can factor large numbers much faster than classical algorithms.Currently there exist some algorithms utilizing the advantage of quantum computers. Shor's algorithm, which outlines a method of factoring large numbers using quantum computation, has played a vital part in establishing quantum computation as an active area of research in physics and computer science. It is one of the few quantum algorithms whose end result is obtained in numerical form. While a number of authors have written explaining the algorithm and some authors have doubted it's usefulness there has been few attempts to examine the algorithm critically from the standpoint of it's eventual use to obtain the factors of large numbers. Shor's quantum algorithm is very important for cryptography, since it can factor large numbers much faster than classical algorithms. Index Terms-RSA, cryptosystem, shor's algorithm.","authors":["Ateeq Ur Rehman"],"meta":["August 2020"],"references":["2185055_Shor's_Quantum_Factoring_Algorithm","268045314_Still_Guarding_Secrets_after_Years_of_Attacks_RSA_Earns_Accolades_for_its_Founders","220426289_A_Method_for_Obtaining_Digital_Signatures_and_Public-Key_Cryptosystems","2818380_Polynomial-Time_Algorithms_For_Prime_Factorization_And_Discrete_Logarithms_On_A_Quantum_Computer","2661734_Algorithms_for_Quantum_Computation_Discrete_Logarithms_and_Factoring"]}
