{"id":"287853846_Graphs_of_Edge-Intersecting_and_Non-Splitting_One_Bend_Paths_in_a_Grid","abstract":"The families EPT (resp. EPG) Edge Intersection Graphs of Paths in a tree\n(resp. in a grid) are well studied graph classes. Recently we introduced the\ngraph classes Edge-Intersecting and Non-Splitting Paths in a Tree ENPT, and in\na Grid (ENPG). It was shown that ENPG contains an infinite hierarchy of\nsubclasses that are obtained by restricting the number of bends in the paths.\nMotivated by this result, in this work we focus on one bend {ENPG} graphs. We\nshow that one bend ENPG graphs are properly included in two bend ENPG graphs.\nWe also show that trees and cycles are one bend ENPG graphs, and characterize\nthe split graphs and co-bipartite graphs that are one bend ENPG. We prove that\nthe recognition problem of one bend ENPG split graphs is NP-complete even in a\nvery restricted subfamily of split graphs. Last we provide a linear time\nrecognition algorithm for one bend ENPG co-bipartite graphs.","authors":["Arman BoyacÄ±","Tinaz Ekim","Mordechai Shalom","Shmuel Zaks"],"meta":["December 2015Discrete mathematics & theoretical computer science DMTCS 19(1)","SourcearXiv"],"references":["262167702_Approximation_Algorithms_for_B_1-EPG_Graphs","228565204_Linear-time_certifying_algorithms_for_recognizing_split_graphs_and_related_graph_classes","312915751_On_edge-intersection_graphs_of_k-bend_paths_in_grids","283465021_Graphs_of_edge-intersecting_and_non-splitting_paths","266549826_Aus_der_Theorie_der_endlichen_regularen_Graphen_dritten_und_vierten_Grades","256487757_Graphs_of_Edge-Intersecting_Non-Splitting_Paths_in_a_Tree_Towards_Hole_Representations-Part_I","230872795_Some_properties_of_edge_intersection_graphs_of_single-bend_paths_on_a_grid","227733275_Edge_Intersection_Graphs_of_Single_Bend_Paths_on_a_Grid","225136989_Bimodular_Decomposition_of_Bipartite_Graphs","223640137_Edge_and_vertex_intersection_of_paths_in_a_tree"]}
