{"id":"271548605_Game_development_life_cycle_guidelines","abstract":"Game is a kind of software with goal to provide entertainment. However, during the real game development practice, simply adopting the software development life cycle (SDLC) is not enough, as the developers face several challenges during its life cycle. To address the problem, game development uses a kind of specific approach called game development life cycle (GDLC) to direct the game development. However, none of the existing GDLCs explicitly address how to successfully deliver a good quality game. This paper presents a new game development life cycle model and guidelines to successfully deliver a good quality game. Several quality criterias are explicitly considered at each phase.","authors":["Rido Ramadan","Yani Widyani"],"meta":["September 2013","DOI:10.1109/ICACSIS.2013.6761558","Conference: 2013 International Conference on Advanced Computer Science and Information Systems (ICACSIS)"],"references":["220686446_What_went_wrong_A_survey_of_problems_in_game_development","273947104_Game_Design_Workshop_A_Playcentric_Approach_to_Creating_Innovative_Games","273946774_Fundamentals_of_Game_Design","254690860_Management_of_an_Online_Game_Development_Project","240249302_Software_Engineering_a_Practioner''s_approach","234774872_Classical_and_Object-Oriented_Software_Engineering_W_Uml_and_C","229652266_Drug_Development_Project_Management","224503662_Software_Engineering_Challenges_in_Game_Development"]}
