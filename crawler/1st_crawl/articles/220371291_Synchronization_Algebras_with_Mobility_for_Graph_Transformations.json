{"id":"220371291_Synchronization_Algebras_with_Mobility_for_Graph_Transformations","abstract":"We propose a generalization of synchronization algebras that allows to deal with mobility and local resource handling. We show how it can be used to model communication primitives for distributed and mobile computations, such as the ones used in the global computing area. We propose a graph transformation formalism in the Synchronized Hyperedge Replacement approach which is parametric w.r.t. the synchronization algebra and thus allows to model complex systems based on the chosen communication primitives. We thus unify different models described in the literature and we allow to easily define new ones. We present various examples and a case study on Fusion Calculus, showing how different semantics for it can be derived using different synchronization algebras.","authors":["Ivan Lanese","Ugo Montanari"],"meta":["September 2005Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science 138(1):43-60","DOI:10.1016/j.entcs.2005.05.004","SourceDBLP"],"references":["227310370_Event_structures","220700514_Synchronized_Hyperedge_Replacement_with_Name_Mobility","244428319_Graph_Transformation_Models_for_Software_Architecture_Styles","236853724_Winning_Ways_For_Your_Mathematical_Plays","232644595_Graph-Grammars_An_Algebraic_Approach","221443111_The_Fusion_Calculus_Expressiveness_and_Symmetry_in_Mobile_Processes","220997722_Bigraphs_and_transitions","220993998_Reconfiguration_of_Software_Architecture_Styles_with_Name_Mobility","220829353_A_LTS_Semantics_of_Ambients_via_Graph_Synchronization_with_Mobility","220431558_A_model_for_distributed_systems_based_on_graph_rewriting"]}
