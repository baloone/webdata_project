{"id":"325456015_Information_Communication_Technology_Use_among_Students_in_Inclusive_Classrooms","abstract":"Inclusion has brought diversity into 21st-century classrooms and introduced challenges for teachers who must adapt their teaching to diverse groups of children. Related research findings indicate that information and communication technology (ICT) can be used to provide personalized learning and support inclusion. Our research compared the school- and leisure-related computer use of students in inclusive classrooms. The frequency of computer use, types of ICT-supported activities, and attitudes toward computer use were examined. Consistent with those of previous studies, our findings show that students with special needs (SN) and their peers use computers more frequently for leisure activities than for school activities. Compared with their peers, students with SN use computers less frequently and are more resistant to computer use. No correlation was found between the presence of SN and a student’s desire to use a computer or a student’s opinion on whether computer use improves learning success. A comparison of male and female students revealed that boys use computers more frequently, and have a stronger belief that computer use improves learning success. This study discusses ICT integration in inclusive classrooms for personalized learning in all domains of learning, the cognitive, affective–social, and psychomotor domains. The main conclusions derived from the study inform teachers in planning their ICT integration for cognitive, social and emotional scaffolding of students in inclusive classrooms.","authors":["Špela Bagon","Gacnik Mateja","Andreja Istenic Starcic"],"meta":["May 2018International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning (iJET) 13(6)","DOI:10.3991/ijet.v13i06.8051","Project: Educational technology for inclusion"],"references":["338473364_Attitudes_towards_inclusion_by_Slovenian_teachers_in_the_context_of_findings_from_other_countries","266475451_Assistive_technologies_for_students_with_disabilities_A_survey_of_access_and_use_in_Turkish_universities","265606414_Gender-inclusive_game-based_learning_in_secondary_education","233089183_Inclusiveness_of_ICT_in_secondary_education_Students_appreciation_of_ICT_tools","317615150_Tablet-based_cross-curricular_maths_vs_traditional_maths_classroom_practice_for_higher-order_learning_outcomes","281165909_Cognitive_style_and_gender_differences_in_children's_mathematics_achievement","259893641_Cognitive_style_and_gender_differences_in_children's_mathematics_achievement","257351300_ICT_supported_learning_for_people_with_special_needs_Review_of_seven_educational_technology_journals_1970-2011_British_Journal_of_Educational_Technology_452_202-230","249379719_Does_a_Computer_System_Help_to_Teach_a_Sight_Vocabulary_to_Children_with_Severe_Learning_Difficulties","248914120_Attitudes_toward_computers_A_study_of_post-secondary_students_in_Singapore","230799441_Slovak_high_school_students'_attitudes_to_ICT_using_in_biology_lesson","230409483_Would_boys_and_girls_benefit_from_gender-specific_educational_software","230003660_The_effect_of_different_representations_on_reading_digital_text_for_students_with_cognitive_disabilities","229675450_An_evaluation_of_Wordshark_in_the_classroom","229581468_IV_and_SEN_Using_interactive_video_with_special_educational_needs_pupils"]}
