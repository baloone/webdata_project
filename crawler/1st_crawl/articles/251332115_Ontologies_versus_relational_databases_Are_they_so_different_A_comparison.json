{"id":"251332115_Ontologies_versus_relational_databases_Are_they_so_different_A_comparison","abstract":"Two main data models are currently used for representing knowledge and information in computer systems. Database models, especially\nrelational databases, have been the leader in last few decades, enabling information to be efficiently stored and queried.\nOn the other hand, ontologies have appeared as an alternative to databases in applications that require a more ‘enriched’\nmeaning. However, there is controversy regarding the best information modeling technique, as both models present similar characteristics.\nIn this paper, we present a review of how ontologies and databases are related, of what their main differences are and of\nthe mechanisms used to communicate with each other.","authors":["Carmen Martínez-Cruz","Ignacio J.
