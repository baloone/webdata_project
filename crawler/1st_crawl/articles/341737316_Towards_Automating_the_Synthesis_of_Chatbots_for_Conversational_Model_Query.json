{"id":"341737316_Towards_Automating_the_Synthesis_of_Chatbots_for_Conversational_Model_Query","abstract":"Conversational interfaces (also called chatbots) are being increasingly adopted in various domains such as e-commerce or customer service, as a direct communication channel between companies and end-users. Their advantage is that they can be embedded within social networks, and provide a natural language (NL) interface that enables their use by non-technical users. While there are many emerging platforms for building chatbots, their construction remains a highly technical, challenging task.","authors":["Sara PÃ©rez-Soler","Gwendal Daniel","Jordi Cabot","Esther Guerra"],"meta":["May 2020","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-49418-6_17","Conference: International Conference on Business Process Modeling, Development and Support International Conference on Evaluation and Modeling Methods for Systems Analysis and Development","Projects: Cognification of model-driven engineering: Models + AIModel Driven Engineering for Bot Applications"],"references":["338616011_Xatkit_A_Multimodal_Low-Code_Chatbot_Development_Framework","334153698_Towards_Conversational_Syntax_for_Domain-Specific_Languages_using_Chatbots","332659386_Conversational_Data_Exploration","326339844_Collaborative_Modelling_and_Group_Decision-Making_using_Chatbots_within_Social_Networks","317418656_The_Rise_of_Bots_A_Survey_of_Conversational_Interfaces_Patterns_and_Paradigms","313204805_A_New_Chatbot_for_Customer_Service_on_Social_Media","336906408_Modeling_Conversational_Agents_for_Service_Systems","335642288_Current_and_Future_Bots_in_Software_Development","322060744_Software_Bots","320388367_Generating_chat_bots_from_web_API_specifications"]}
