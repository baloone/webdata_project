{"id":"325134261_Solid_harmonic_wavelet_scattering_for_predictions_of_molecule_properties","abstract":"We present a machine learning algorithm for the prediction of molecule properties inspired by ideas from density functional theory (DFT). Using Gaussian-type orbital functions, we create surrogate electronic densities of the molecule from which we compute invariant “solid harmonic scattering coefficients” that account for different types of interactions at different scales. Multilinear regressions of various physical properties of molecules are computed from these invariant coefficients. Numerical experiments show that these regressions have near state-of-the-art performance, even with relatively few training examples. Predictions over small sets of scattering coefficients can reach a DFT precision while being interpretable.","authors":["Michael Eickenberg","Georgios Exarchakis","Matthew Hirn","Stéphane Georges Mallat"],"meta":["June 2018The Journal of Chemical Physics 148(24):241732","DOI:10.1063/1.5023798"],"references":["333263977_Solid_Harmonic_Wavelet_Scattering_Predicting_Quantum_Molecular_Energy_from_Invariant_Descriptors_of_3D_Electronic_Densities","321902108_WACSF_-_Weighted_Atom-Centered_Symmetry_Functions_as_Descriptors_in_Machine_Learning_Potentials","317954658_SchNet_A_continuous-filter_convolutional_neural_network_for_modeling_quantum_interactions","311306736_Quantum-Chemical_Insights_from_Deep_Tensor_Neural_Networks","310329192_Machine_Learning_of_Accurate_Energy-Conserving_Molecular_Force_Fields","303281452_Wavelet_Scattering_Regression_of_Quantum_Chemical_Energies","291229751_Comparing_molecules_and_solids_across_structural_and_alchemical_space","287686905_Moment_Tensor_Potentials_A_Class_of_Systematically_Improvable_Interatomic_Potentials","315795307_Neural_Message_Passing_for_Quantum_Chemistry","291348262_A_fingerprint_based_metric_for_measuring_similarities_of_crystalline_structures"]}
