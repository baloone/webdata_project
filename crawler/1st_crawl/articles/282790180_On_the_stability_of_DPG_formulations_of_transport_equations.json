{"id":"282790180_On_the_stability_of_DPG_formulations_of_transport_equations","abstract":"In this paper we formulate and analyze a Discontinuous Petrov Galerkin\nformulation of linear transport equations with variable convection fields. We\nshow that a corresponding {\\em infinite dimensional} mesh-dependent variational\nformulation, in which besides the principal field also its trace on the mesh\nskeleton is an unknown, is uniformly stable with respect to the mesh, where the\ntest space is a certain product space over the underlying domain partition.\nOur main result states then the following. For piecewise polynomial trial\nspaces of degree $m$, we show under mild assumptions on the convection field\nthat piecewise polynomial test spaces of degree $m+1$ over a refinement of the\nprimal partition with uniformly bounded refinement depth give rise to uniformly\n(with respect to the mesh size) stable Petrov-Galerkin discretizations. The\npartitions are required to be shape regular but need not be quasi-uniform. An\nimportant startup ingredient is that for a constant convection field one can\nidentify the exact optimal test functions with respect to a suitably modified\nbut uniformly equivalent broken test space norm as piecewise polynomials. These\ntest functions are then varied towards simpler and stably computable\nnear-optimal test functions for which the above result is derived via a\nperturbation analysis. We conclude indicating some consequences of the results\nthat will be treated in forthcoming work.","authors":["Dirk Broersen","Wolfgang Dahmen","R. P.
