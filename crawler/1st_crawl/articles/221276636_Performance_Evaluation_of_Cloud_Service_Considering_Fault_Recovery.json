{"id":"221276636_Performance_Evaluation_of_Cloud_Service_Considering_Fault_Recovery","abstract":"Cloud computing is a recent trend in IT, which has attracted lots of attention. In cloud computing, service reliability and\nservice performance are two important issues. To improve cloud service reliability, fault tolerance techniques such as fault\nrecovery may be used, which in turn has impact on cloud service performance. Such impact deserves detailed research. Although\nthere exist some researches on cloud/grid service reliability and performance, very few of them addressed the issues of fault\nrecovery and its impact on service performance. In this paper, we conduct detailed research on performance evaluation of cloud\nservice considering fault recovery. We consider recovery on both processing nodes and communication links. The commonly adopted\nassumption of Poisson arrivals of usersâ€™ service requests is relaxed, and the interarrival times of service requests can take\narbitrary probability distribution. The precedence constraints of subtasks are also considered. The probability distribution \nof service response time is derived, and a numerical example is presented. The proposed cloud performance evaluation models\nand methods could yield results which are realistic, and thus are of practical value for related decision-makings in cloud\ncomputing.","authors":["Bo Yang","Feng Tan","Yuan-Shun Dai","Suchang Guo"],"meta":["January 2009The Journal of Supercomputing 65(1):571-576","DOI:10.1007/s11227-011-0551-2","SourceDBLP","Conference: Cloud Computing, First International Conference, CloudCom 2009, Beijing, China, December 1-4, 2009.
