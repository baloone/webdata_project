{"id":"307174794_Statistical_Machine_Translation","abstract":"This introductory text to statistical machine translation (SMT) provides all of the theories and methods needed to build a statistical machine translator, such as Google Language Tools and Babelfish. In general, statistical techniques allow automatic translation systems to be built quickly for any language-pair using only translated texts and generic software. With increasing globalization, statistical machine translation will be central to communication and commerce. Based on courses and tutorials, and classroom-tested globally, it is ideal for instruction or self-study, for advanced undergraduates and graduate students in computer science and/or computational linguistics, and researchers in natural language processing. The companion website provides open-source corpora and tool-kits.","authors":["Philipp Koehn"],"meta":["January 2009","DOI:10.1017/CBO9780511815829","Publisher: Cambridge University Press"],"references":["265657436_Automatic_Sentence_Segmentation_and_Punctuation_Prediction_for_Spoken_Language_Translation","237327924_Continuous_space_language_models_for_the_IWSLT_2006_task","237247141_The_TALP_Ngram-based_SMT_system_for_IWSLT_2007","237247130_The_TALP-UPC_Ngram-based_statistical_machine_translation_system_for_ACL-WMT_2008","234815897_A_statistical_approach_to_language_translation","234815723_Two_tools_for_creating_and_visualizing_sub-sentential_alignments_of_parallel_text","234811483_The_LDV-COMBO_system_for_SMT","234802687_Methods_and_practical_issues_in_evaluating_alignment_techniques","230668373_Using_shallow_syntax_information_to_improve_word_alignment_and_reordering_for_SMT","228945619_Word_error_rates_Decomposition_over_POS_classes_and_applications_for_error_analysis","228934789_Improved_language_Modeling_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation","228930008_Syntax-enhanced_N-gram-based_SMT","228847712_Training_Non-Parametric_Features_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation","228565799_A_tree-to-string_phrase-based_model_for_statistical_machine_translation","228382112_Statistical_post-editing_on_SYSTRAN's_rule-based_translation_system","228361002_Using_Word_Dependent_Transition_Models_in_HMM_based_Word_Alignment_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation","228345919_Online_learning_methods_for_discriminative_training_of_phrase_based_statistical_machine_translation","221102617_Domain_Adaptation_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation_with_Domain_Dictionary_and_Monolingual_Corpora","221102061_Source_language_markers_in_EUROPARL_translations","221101819_Extracting_Synchronous_Grammar_Rules_From_Word-Level_Alignments_in_Linear_Time","221013110_Statistical_Machine_Reordering","221012800_Hierarchical_System_Combination_for_Machine_Translation","221012607_Efficient_Search_for_Inversion_Transduction_Grammar","220875166_Context-Dependent_SMT_Model_using_Bilingual_Verb-Noun_Collocation","220874945_Forest-to-String_Statistical_Translation_Rules","220874849_Measure_Word_Generation_for_English-Chinese_SMT_Systems","220874675_Applying_Morphology_Generation_Models_to_Machine_Translation","220874222_The_Complexity_of_Phrase_Alignment_Problems","220874206_Multilingual_Transliteration_Using_Feature_based_Phonetic_Method","220874129_Assisting_Translators_in_Indirect_Lexical_Transfer","220874006_Generating_Complex_Morphology_for_Machine_Translation","304744516_Estimating_phrase_pair_relevance_for_machine_translation_pruning","292732488_The_NICTATR_speech_translation_system_for_IWSLT_2007","253374336_Using_Moses_to_Integrate_Multiple_Rule-Based_Machine_Translation_Engines_into_a_Hybrid_System","253358390_Estimation_of_confidence_measures_for_machine_translation","252058737_Prior_Derivation_Models_For_Formally_Syntax-based_Translation_Using_Linguistically_Syntactic_Parsing_and_Tree_Kernels","251481866_Fast_Easy_and_Cheap_Construction_of_Statistical_Machine_Translation_Models_with_MapReduce","228974506_Correlating_automated_and_human_assessments_of_machine_translation_quality","228779927_Multi-level_bootstrapping_for_extracting_parallel_sentences_from_a_quasi-comparable_corpus","228630227_Domain_adaptation_in_statistical_machine_translation_with_mixture_modelling","221101771_Syntactic_Reordering_Integrated_with_Phrase-Based_SMT","221101573_Tera-Scale_Translation_Models_via_Pattern_Matching","221101280_Choosing_the_Right_Translation_A_Syntactically_Informed_Classification_Approach","221013338_Using_RBMT_systems_to_produce_bilingual_corpus_for_SMT","221013011_Modeling_Impression_in_Probabilistic_Transliteration_into_Chinese","221012971_Improving_Word_Alignment_with_Bridge_Languages","220874869_Word_Translation_Disambiguation_Using_Bilingual_Bootstrapping","220874577_Improved_Discriminative_Bilingual_Word_Alignment","220874281_Bootstrapping_a_Stochastic_Transducer_for_Arabic-English_Transliteration_Extraction","220873993_Phrase_Table_Training_for_Precision_and_Recall_What_Makes_a_Good_Phrase_and_a_Good_Phrase_Pair","220873967_Exploiting_N-best_Hypotheses_for_SMT_Self-Enhancement","220873925_Punjabi_Machine_Transliteration","220873273_Semantic_Transliteration_of_Personal_Names","220873547_Regression_for_Sentence-Level_MT_Evaluation_with_Pseudo_References","220873188_Going_Beyond_AER_An_Extensive_Analysis_of_Word_Alignments_and_Their_Impact_on_MT"]}
