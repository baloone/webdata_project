{"id":"338387061_Formation_par_alternance_et_satisfaction_professionnelle_des_enseignants_novices","abstract":"Cooperative training and job satisfaction for novice teachers\nThis study analyses conditions of formation for working in the satisfaction of professional teacher for novices in work. This study is part of a research program based on epistemological principles derived from cultural anthropology, which has been much inspired by the analytical philosophy of Wittgenstein (2004). It was carried out in the framework of an innovative system of training in alternation articulating training sequences and work sequences in class. The results of this study allow us to situate two main training circumstances that have led to PTs’ job satisfaction: (i) the structuring of the formation allowing the construction of a collective of trainers; (ii) the creation and strengthening of a link between trainers between university teaching and their uses in the professional context.","authors":["Jerome Amathieu","Guillaume Escalie","Stefano Bertone","Chaliès Sébastien"],"meta":["January 2018Les Sciences de l'education pour l'ere nouvelle 51(4):87","DOI:10.3917/lsdle.514.0087"],"references":["322577448_A_quoi_sert_le_tutorat_dans_la_formation_des_enseignants_Le_ou_les_tutorats","322307271_Etude_des_circonstances_permettant_a_des_enseignants_novices_d'education_physique_et_sportive_de_se_former_a_l'enseignement_a_partir_d'experiences_de_pratiquant_dans_les_activites_physiques_sportives_","276396879_Job_Satisfaction_Stress_and_Coping_Strategies_in_the_Teaching_Profession-What_Do_Teachers_Say","254934696_Professional_Development_and_Teacher_Change","249704767_Rethinking_the_Connections_Between_Campus_Courses_and_Field_Experiences_in_College_and_University-Based_Teacher_Education","248526848_The_antecedents_of_teacher_satisfaction_with_professional_development_programs","241423878_Constructing_21st-Century_Teacher_Education","232560805_Different_Forms_of_Work_Satisfaction_Concept_and_Qualitative_Research","223165718_Teacher_education_graduates'_teaching_commitment_and_entrance_into_the_teaching_profession","5321418_Parameters_influencing_health_variables_in_a_sample_of_949_German_teachers","349774307_Le_travail_a_coeur_Pour_en_finir_avec_les_risques_psychosociaux","346264691_L'experience_mimetique_dans_l'apprentissage_adulte_le_cas_des_formations_par_simulation","342671206_Tout_est-il_interpretation","322266765_Teachers'_occupational_attributes_and_their_psychological_wellbeing_job_satisfaction_occupational_self-concept_and_quitting_intentions","321015813_Effets_d'un_dispositif_de_type_coteaching_sur_le_developpement_professionnel_des_enseignants_novices_etudes_de_cas_en_formation_universitaire","302369385_Les_formes_sociales_de_la_pensee_la_sociologie_apres_Wittgenstein","291294703_The_nature_and_causes_of_job_satisfaction_handbook_of_industrial_and_organizational_psychology","256459247_How_different_mentoring_approaches_affect_beginning_teachers'_development_in_the_first_years_of_practice","251596459_Creating_a_Third_Space_in_Student_Teaching_Implications_for_the_University_Supervisor's_Status_as_Outsider","248526941_Training_preservice_teachers_rapidly_The_need_to_articulate_the_training_given_by_university_supervisors_and_cooperating_teachers","247091354_Wittgenstein_and_contemporary_theories_of_word_learning","229443138_Examples_as_Method_My_Attempts_to_Understand_Assessment_and_Fairness_In_the_Spirit_of_the_Later_Wittgenstein","228079299_The_Confounding_Role_of_Personality_and_Trait_Affectivity_in_the_Relationship_Between_Job_and_Life_Satisfaction","223770449_Test_of_the_social_cognitive_model_of_work_satisfaction","223491679_Co-analysis_of_work_in_the_triadic_supervision_of_preservice_teachers_based_on_neo-Vygotskian_activity_theory_Case_study_from_a_French_university_institute_of_teacher_training","222987142_Situated_learning_theory_and_the_pedagogy_of_teacher_education_Towards_an_integrative_view_of_teacher_behavior_and_teacher_learning","222760029_A_role_for_practising_teachers_in_initial_teacher_education"]}
