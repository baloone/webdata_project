{"id":"221515150_Research_through_design_as_a_method_for_interaction_design_research_in_HCI","abstract":"For years the HCI community has struggled to integrate design in research and practice. While design has gained a strong foothold in practice, it has had much less impact on the HCI research community. In this paper we propose a new model for interaction design research within HCI. Following a research through design approach, designers produce novel integrations of HCI research in an attempt to make the right thing: a product that transforms the world from its current state to a preferred state. This model allows interaction designers to make research contributions based on their strength in addressing under-constrained problems. To formalize this model, we provide a set of four lenses for evaluating the research contribution and a set of three examples to illustrate the benefits of this type of research.","authors":["John Zimmerman","Jodi Forlizzi","Shelley Evenson"],"meta":["April 2007","DOI:10.1145/1240624.1240704","SourceDBLP","Conference: Proceedings of the 2007 Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, CHI 2007, San Jose, California, USA, April 28 - May 3, 2007","Project: Research through Design"],"references":["235701067_Design_Research_Methods_and_Perspectives","235700969_Investigating_Design_A_Review_of_Forty_Years_of_Design_Research","346827958_Design_for_Usability_Crafting_a_Strategy_for_the_Design_of_a_New_Generation_of_Xerox_Copiers","284222095_Research_in_Art_and_Design","272088622_Sciences_of_The_Artificial","259782629_The_Design_Way_Intentional_Change_in_an_Unpredictable_World","249562982_Research_Design_and_New_Learning","243577654_Guides_characterizing_the_interface","242529667_Design_Noir_The_Secret_Life_of_Electronic_Objects","235700908_Design_Research_A_Disciplined_Conversation"]}
