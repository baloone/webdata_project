{"id":"322877874_An_election_protocol_based_on_group_membership_detection_algorithm_in_mobile_ad_hoc_distributed_systems","abstract":"The election model can be used as a composing element to solve many practical problems such as mutual exclusion, consensus problem and reliable broadcasting in which a control function would be useful. This model has been deeply examined in the study group since the motive for this much interest is that networked computer system paradigms require a coordinator such as leader. In spite of its importance, there is only a few study that has been contributed to this coordinator election model in an ad hoc distributed system. Mobile distributed computing systems are more inclined to faults than traditional computer systems. To build an election protocol in such a mobile computing environment is not trivial. Because it is difficult task to choose a unique process from a group of mobile processes as a coordinator in spite of failures or disconnections of mobile processes. In this paper, we present an election protocol in mobile ad hoc distributed systems and we discuss some simulation results.","authors":["SungHoon Park","SuChang Yoo","BoKyoung Kim"],"meta":["May 2018The Journal of Supercomputing 74(3)","DOI:10.1007/s11227-018-2258-0"],"references":["261320060_Energy-Efficient_Leader_Election_Protocols_for_Single-Hop_Radio_Networks","228696279_Running_Multicast_Applications_Using_Reconfigurable_Parallel_System","224568576_A_New_Approach_For_Election_Algorithm_in_Distributed_Systems","313671238_Adaptive_clustering_for_mobile_wireless_networks","278722639_GloMoSim","274056221_Group_communication","262316180_Quorum-based_mutual_exclusion_in_asynchronous_distributed_systems_with_unreliable_failure_detectors","261266475_An_Evaluation_of_Efficient_Leader_Election_Algorithms_for_Crash-Recovery_Systems","232644613_Election_in_Asynchronous_Complete_Networks_with_Intermittent_Link_Failures","225142824_The_election_problem_in_asynchronous_distributed_systems_with_bounded_faulty_processes","221329975_Distributed_Systems_-_Towards_a_Formal_Approach","221406610_Optimal_regional_consecutive_leader_election_in_mobile_ad-hoc_networks","220567106_Optimal_Asynchronous_Agreement_and_Leader_Election_Algorithm_for_Complete_Networks_with_Byzantine_Faulty_Links","220421430_Group_Communication_Introduction_to_the_Special_Section","220358898_Parallel_stereocorrelation_on_a_reconfigurable_multi-ring_network"]}
