{"id":"281896757_Universal_Hashing_for_Information-Theoretic_Security","abstract":"The information-theoretic approach to security entails harnessing the correlated randomness available in nature to establish security. It uses tools from information theory and coding and yields provable security, even against an adversary with unbounded computational power. However, the feasibility of this approach in practice depends on the development of efficiently implementable schemes. In this paper, we review a special class of practical schemes for information-theoretic security that are based on 2-universal hash families. Specific cases of secret key agreement and wiretap coding are considered, and general themes are identified. The scheme presented for wiretap coding is modular and can be implemented easily by including an extra preprocessing layer over the existing transmission codes.","authors":["Himanshu Tyagi","Alexander Vardy"],"meta":["October 2015Proceedings of the IEEE 103(10):1781-1795","DOI:10.1109/JPROC.2015.2462774"],"references":["274902848_Equivocations_Exponents_and_Second-Order_Coding_Rates_Under_Various_Renyi_Information_Measures","268550377_Common_information_is_far_less_than_mutual_information","267811858_Secret_Key_Agreement_General_Capacity_and_Second-Order_Asymptotics","266396609_Strong_Converse_for_a_Degraded_Wiretap_Channel_via_Active_Hypothesis_Testing","264535317_The_Complexity_of_Estimating_R'enyi_Entropy","258764441_More_Efficient_Privacy_Amplification_with_Non-Uniform_Random_Seeds_via_Dual_Universal_Hash_Function","257582416_Cyber_security_in_the_Smart_Grid_Survey_and_challenges","236871680_Polar_Coding_for_Secret-Key_Generation","235008680_Pseudorandom_generation_from_one-way_functions","225505792_Lattice_Codes_for_the_Gaussian_Wiretap_Channel","224679106_Efficient_Protocols_Achieving_the_Commitment_Capacity_of_Noisy_Correlations","224578475_Invertible_Extractors_and_Wiretap_Protocols","224320113_On_Oblivious_Transfer_Capacity","224260713_Achieving_the_Secrecy_Capacity_of_Wiretap_Channels_Using_Polar_Codes","224157913_Construction_of_wiretap_codes_from_ordinary_channel_codes","224136942_Secure_Wireless_Communication_with_Dynamic_Secrets","304620800_Secure_Multiplex_Coding_with_Dependent_and_Non-Uniform_Multiple_Messages","303027925_Secret_Key_Agreement_General_Capacity_and_Second-Order_Asymptotics","296877745_Almost_independence_and_secrecy_channel","286552928_Estimating_the_Unseen_Improved_Estimators_for_Entropy_and_Other_Properties","271368510_Explicit_capacity-achieving_coding_scheme_for_the_Gaussian_wiretap_channel","269269612_Decomposing_the_MIMO_wiretap_channel","268171082_A_Bound_for_Multiparty_Secret_Key_Agreement_and_Implications_for_a_Problem_of_Secure_Computing","267119313_Semantic_Security_for_the_Wiretap_Channel","266856083_Achieving_Secrecy_Capacity_of_the_Wiretap_Channel_and_Broadcast_Channel_with_a_Confidential_Component","266063828_Information_Theory_Coding_Theorems_for_Discrete_Memoryless_Systems","265929448_Wire-tap_channel_II","265603271_Security_of_quantum_key_distribution","265555890_Achieving_AWGN_Channel_Capacity_with_Lattice_Gaussian_Coding","263037786_A_New_Upperbound_for_the_Oblivious_Transfer_Capacity_of_Discrete_Memoryless_Channels","261836100_Converses_For_Secret_Key_Agreement_and_Secure_Computing","261431897_Wormhole_detection_using_channel_characteristics","261199587_Channel_upgrading_for_semantically-secure_encryption_on_wiretap_channels","261116496_A_new_polar_coding_scheme_for_strong_security_on_wiretap_channels","261024398_Error-free_perfect-secrecy_systems","260636982_Coding_for_Secrecy_An_Overview_of_Error-Control_Coding_Techniques_for_Physical-Layer_Security","259105592_Efficient_One-Way_Secret-Key_Agreement_and_Private_Channel_Coding_via_Polarization","257803302_Protecting_AES_against_side-channel_analysis_using_wire-tap_codes","242589487_The_Wire-tap_Channel","240048779_Information-Spectrum_Methods_in_Information_Theory","236136652_Common_Information_and_Secret_Key_Capacity","232697207_Semantically_Secure_Lattice_Codes_for_the_Gaussian_Wiretap_Channel","228704757_Universal_hash_functions_for_emerging_ultra-low-power_networks","226781942_Information-Theoretic_Key_Agreement_From_Weak_to_Strong_Secrecy_for_Free","225040144_On_the_Efficiency_of_Classical_and_Quantum_Secure_Function_Evaluation","224754072_Smooth_Renyi_entropy_and_applications","224679064_LDPC-based_secret_key_agreement_over_the_Gaussian_wiretap_channel","224621748_Secret_Key_and_Private_Key_Constructions_for_Simple_Multiterminal_Source_Models","224224724_On_the_Randomness_of_Independent_Experiments","224152885_Polar_codes_for_Slepian-Wolf_Wyner-Ziv_and_Gelfand-Pinsker","224132864_Channel_Coding_Rate_in_the_Finite_Blocklength_Regime","224120031_Information-Theoretically_Secret_Key_Generation_for_Fading_Wireless_Channels","221661394_Quantum_Wiretap_Channel_With_Non-Uniform_Random_Number_and_Its_Exponent_and_Equivocation_Rate_of_Leaked_Information","222457947_Universal_classes_of_hash_functions","222439046_Probabilistic_Encryption"]}
