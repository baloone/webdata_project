{"id":"334168754_Likes_retweets_and_polarization","abstract":"A key part of todayâ€™s polarized society is the polarized and polarizing world of social media. Although social media platforms bring the potential of more democratic involvement, greater public dialogue, and faster flow of news and information, the dark side of such Web 2.0 platforms also should concern church leaders and theologians. Already-existing polarization in society leads to a polarized use of social media as individuals seek like-minded online communities. Social media, however, also adds to that polarization by providing echo chambers, and features of social media encourage speed over accuracy and more aggressive communication. Three ways in which social media both represents and adds to polarization in politics, society, and churches are balkanization, as people separate into homogenous, polarized communities, the speeding nature of communication that allows inaccurate and overly emotional information to spread, and the flaming that occurs as anonymity and depersonalization of these communication platforms encourage aggressive and even violent rhetoric.","authors":["Brian Kaylor"],"meta":["May 2019Review & Expositor 116(2):183-192","DOI:10.1177/0034637319851508"],"references":[]}
