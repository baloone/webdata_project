{"id":"306172958_A_Bounded_p-norm_Approximation_of_Max-Convolution_for_Sub-Quadratic_Bayesian_Inference_on_Additive_Factors","abstract":"Max-convolution is an important problem closely resembling standard convolution; as such, max-convolution occurs frequently across many fields. Here we extend the method with fastest known worst-case runtime, which can be applied to nonnegative vectors by numerically approximating the Chebyshev norm ||·||∞, and use this approach to derive two numerically stable methods based on the idea of computing p-norms via fast convolution: The first method proposed, with runtime in O(k log(k) log(log(k))) (which is less than 18k log(k) for any vectors that can be practically realized), uses the p-norm as a direct approximation of the Chebyshev norm. The second approach proposed, with runtime in O(k log(k)) (although in practice both perform similarly), uses a novel null space projection method, which extracts information from a sequence of p-norms to estimate the maximum value in the vector (this is equivalent to querying a small number of moments from a distribution of bounded support in order to estimate the maximum). The p-norm approaches are compared to one another and are shown to compute an approximation of the Viterbi path in a hidden Markov model where the transition matrix is a Toeplitz matrix; the runtime of approximating the Viterbi path is thus reduced from O(nk²) steps to O(nk log(k)) steps in practice, and is demonstrated by inferring the U.S. unemployment rate from the S&P 500 stock index.","authors":["Julianus Pfeuffer","Oliver Serang"],"meta":["April 2016Journal of Machine Learning Research 17"],"references":["260809184_The_Probabilistic_Convolution_Tree_Efficient_Exact_Bayesian_Inference_for_Faster_LC-MSMS_Protein_Inference","220690331_Handbook_of_Computer_Vision_Algorithms_in_Image_Algebra","4351272_Fast_gain-adaptive_KLT_tracking_on_the_GPU","2788563_Accuracy_Of_The_Discrete_Fourier_Transform_And_The_Fast_Fourier_Transform","270824650_A_Fast_Numerical_Method_for_Max-Convolution_and_the_Application_to_Efficient_Max-Product_Inference_in_Bayesian_Networks","262250651_Continuity_for_network_calculus","222470079_Fast_algorithms_for_the_maximum_convolution_problem","222464005_Rapid_Solution_of_Integral_Equations_of_Classical_Potential_Theory","45658651_Efficient_Marginalization_to_Compute_Protein_Posterior_Probabilities_from_Shotgun_Mass_Spectrometry_Data"]}
