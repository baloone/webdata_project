{"id":"319391733_Network_Slicing_for_Ultra-Reliable_Low_Latency_Communication_in_Industry_40_Scenarios","abstract":"An important novelty of 5G is its role in transforming the industrial production into Industry 4.0. Specifically, Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communications (URLLC) will, in many cases, enable replacement of cables with wireless connections and bring freedom in designing and operating interconnected machines, robots, and devices. However, not all industrial links will be of URLLC type; e.g. some applications will require high data rates. Furthermore, these industrial networks will be highly heterogeneous, featuring various communication technologies. We consider network slicing as a mechanism to handle the diverse set of requirements to the network. We present methods for slicing deterministic and packet-switched industrial communication protocols at an abstraction level that is decoupled from the specific implementation of the underlying technologies. Finally, we show how network calculus can be used to assess the end-to-end properties of the network slices.","authors":["Anders Ellersgaard Kalør","René Guillaume","Jimmy Jessen Nielsen","Andreas Mueller"],"meta":["August 2017"],"references":["325442731_Network_Calculus_A_Comprehensive_Guide","269294836_Cyber_physical_systems_in_the_context_of_Industry_40","263285662_Industrie_40_Hit_or_Hype_Industry_Forum","259294766_Computer_Communication_Within_Industrial_Distributed_Environment-a_Survey","234780708_Network_Calculus_A_Theory_of_Deterministic_Queuing_Systems_for_the_Internet","316025329_5G_A_Tutorial_Overview_of_Standards_Trials_Challenges_Deployment_and_Practice","315487360_The_Future_of_Industrial_Communication_Automation_Networks_in_the_Era_of_the_Internet_of_Things_and_Industry_40","313467700_Latency_Critical_IoT_Applications_in_5G_Perspective_on_the_Design_of_Radio_Interface_and_Network_Architecture","273706692_A_Guide_to_the_Stochastic_Network_Calculus"]}
