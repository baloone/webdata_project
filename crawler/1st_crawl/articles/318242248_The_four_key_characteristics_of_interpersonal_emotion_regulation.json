{"id":"318242248_The_four_key_characteristics_of_interpersonal_emotion_regulation","abstract":"Emotion researchers are increasingly interested in processes by which people influence othersâ€™ feelings. Although one such process, interpersonal emotion regulation, has received particular attention in recent years, there remains confusion about exactly how to define this process. The present article aims to distinguish interpersonal emotion regulation from other, related processes by outlining its four key characteristics. Specifically, interpersonal emotion regulation is presented as a process of (i) regulation, that (ii) has an affective target, (iii) is deliberate, and (iv) has a social target. Considering these characteristics raises questions for future research concerning factors that may influence the process of interpersonal emotion regulation, why interpersonal emotion regulation sometimes fails, and whether interventions can improve people's use of interpersonal emotion regulation.","authors":["Karen Niven"],"meta":["July 2017Current Opinion in Psychology 17","DOI:10.1016/j.copsyc.2017.06.015"],"references":["303502623_Interpersonal_Emotional_Behaviors_and_Physical_Health_A_20-Year_Longitudinal_Study_of_Long-Term_Married_Couples","294897356_Sharing_Concerns_Interpersonal_Worry_Regulation_in_Romantic_Couples","285893709_New_Perspectives_on_Emotional_Contagion_A_Review_of_Classic_and_Recent_Research_on_Facial_Mimicry_and_Contagion","284353037_Leader_Affective_Presence_and_Innovation_in_Teams","283977014_The_role_of_leader_emotion_management_in_leader-member_exchange_and_follower_outcomes","282490801_The_Main_and_Interactive_Effects_of_Maternal_Interpersonal_Emotion_Regulation_and_Negative_Affect_on_Adolescent_Girls'_Borderline_Personality_Disorder_Symptoms","282488496_Becoming_popular_Interpersonal_emotion_regulation_predicts_relationship_formation_in_real_life_social_networks","281733567_Interpersonal_Affect_Dynamics_It_Takes_Two_and_Time_to_Tango","283792380_The_Social_Regulation_of_Emotion_An_Integrative_Cross-Disciplinary_Model","282510094_An_Evolving_View_of_the_Structure_of_Self-Regulation"]}
