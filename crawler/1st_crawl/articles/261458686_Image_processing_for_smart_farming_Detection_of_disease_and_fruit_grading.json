{"id":"261458686_Image_processing_for_smart_farming_Detection_of_disease_and_fruit_grading","abstract":"Due to the increasing demand in the agricultural industry, the need to effectively grow a plant and increase its yield is very important. In order to do so, it is important to monitor the plant during its growth period, as well as, at the time of harvest. In this paper image processing is used as a tool to monitor the diseases on fruits during farming, right from plantation to harvesting. For this purpose artificial neural network concept is used. Three diseases of grapes and two of apple have been selected. The system uses two image databases, one for training of already stored disease images and the other for implementation of query images. Back propagation concept is used for weight adjustment of training database. The images are classified and mapped to their respective disease categories on basis of three feature vectors, namely, color, texture and morphology. From these feature vectors morphology gives 90% correct result and it is more than other two feature vectors. This paper demonstrates effective algorithms for spread of disease and mango counting. Practical implementation of neural networks has been done using MATLAB.","authors":["Monika Jhuria","Ashwani Kumar","Rushikesh Borse"],"meta":["December 2013","DOI:10.1109/ICIIP.2013.6707647","Conference: Image Information Processing (ICIIP), 2013 IEEE Second International Conference on"],"references":["267430095_Leaf_disease_severity_measurement_using_image_processing","264887802_Leaf_Disease_Grading_by_Machine_Vision_and_Fuzzy_Logic","252252777_Digital_Image_Processing_Using_Matlab","223910397_A_review_of_advanced_techniques_for_detecting_plant_diseases","222552521_Multithresholding_of_color_and_gray-level_images_through_a_neural_network_technique","222503474_A_comparative_Study_of_Neural_Network_based_Feature_Extraction","200132362_Digital_Image_Processing_Using_MATLAB_2nd_ed"]}
