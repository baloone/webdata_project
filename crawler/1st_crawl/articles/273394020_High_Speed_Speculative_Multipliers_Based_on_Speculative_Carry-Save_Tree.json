{"id":"273394020_High_Speed_Speculative_Multipliers_Based_on_Speculative_Carry-Save_Tree","abstract":"This paper proposes a novel approach to build integer multiplication circuits based on speculation, a technique which performs a faster-but occasionally wrong-operation resorting to a multi-cycle error correction circuit only in the rare case of error. The proposed speculative multiplier uses a novel speculative carry-save reduction tree using three steps: partial products recoding, partial products partitioning, speculative compression. The speculative tree uses speculative (m:2) counters, with m > 3, that are faster than a conventional tree using full-adders and half-adders. A technique to automatically choose the suitable speculative counters, taking into accounts both error probability and delay, is also presented in the paper. The speculative tree is completed with a fast speculative carry-propagate adder and an error correction circuit. We have synthesized speculative multipliers for several operand lengths using the UMC 65 nm library. Comparisons with conventional multipliers show that speculation is effective when high speed is required. Speculative multipliers allow reaching a higher speed compared with conventional counterparts and are also quite effective in terms of power dissipation, when a high speed operation is required.","authors":["Alessandro Cilardo","Davide De Caro","Nicola Petra","Francesco Caserta"],"meta":["December 2014Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers, IEEE Transactions on 61(12):3426-3435","DOI:10.1109/TCSI.2014.2337231"],"references":["260740303_Multispeculative_Additive_Trees_in_High-Level_Synthesis","260584862_Multispeculative_Addition_Applied_to_Datapath_Synthesis","224517185_A_new_speculative_addition_architecture_suitable_for_two's_complement_operations","220526351_Voltage_Scalable_High-Speed_Robust_Hybrid_Arithmetic_Units_Using_Adaptive_Clocking","3450829_Ultra_Low-Voltage_Low-Power_CMOS_4-2_and_5-2_Compressors_for_Fast_Arithmetic_Circuits","316799237_Monte_Carlo_Methods","271451971_Variable_latency_speculative_addition","254023703_High_performance_reliable_variable_latency_carry_select_addition","238980720_Some_schemes_for_parallel_multipliers","236333918_Fixed-Width_Multipliers_and_Multipliers-Accumulators_With_Min-Max_Approximation_Error","232640668_Novel_Architectures_for_High-Speed_and_Low-Power_3-2_4-2_and_5-2_Compressors","230692731_Speeding_up_Processing_using_Approximation_Circuits","224203544_Design_of_Fixed-Width_Multipliers_With_Linear_Compensation_Function","224091840_Truncated_Binary_Multipliers_With_Variable_Correction_and_Minimum_Mean_Square_Error","221153636_Improving_XOR-Dominated_Circuits_by_Exploiting_Dependencies_between_Operands","220402416_A_Distributed_Controller_for_Managing_Speculative_Functional_Units_in_High_Level_Synthesis","49458783_Variable_Latency_Speculative_Addition_A_New_Paradigm_for_Arithmetic_Circuit_Design","35497409_Performance_improvement_with_logic-level_speculation","3938172_Low-power_4-2_and_5-2_compressors","3476184_A_Suggestion_for_a_Fast_Multiplier","3452216_Dual-Tree_Error_Compensation_for_High_Performance_Fixed-Width_Multipliers","3379043_Design_of_high-speed_low-power_3-2_counter_and_4-2_compressor_for_fast_multipliers","3044322_An_optimal_allocation_of_carry-save-adders_in_arithmetic_circuits","3043922_Optimal_circuits_for_parallel_multipliers","3043609_A_method_for_speed_optimized_partial_product_reduction_and_generation_of_fast_parallel_multipliers_using_an_algorithmic_approach","2976047_Circuit_and_Architecture_Trade-offs_for_High-Speed_Multiplication"]}
