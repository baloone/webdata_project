{"id":"224216574_Revisiting_log-linear_learning_Asynchrony_completeness_and_payoff-based_implementation","abstract":"The theory of learning in games has sought to understand how and why equilibria emerge in non-cooperative games. Traditionally, social science literature develops descriptive game theoretic models for players, analyzes the limiting behavior, and generalizes the results for larger classes of games. Recently, there has been a significant amount of research seeking to understand these behavioral models not from a descriptive point of view, but rather from a prescriptive point of view. The goal is to use these behavioral models as a prescriptive control approach in distributed multi-agent systems where the guaranteed limiting behavior would represent a desirable operating condition.","authors":["Jason Marden","Jeff Shamma"],"meta":["November 2010","DOI:10.1109/ALLERTON.2010.5707044","SourceIEEE Xplore","Conference: Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton), 2010 48th Annual Allerton Conference on"],"references":["230663805_Potential_Games","325919262_Connections_between_cooperative_control_and_potential_games_illustrated_on_the_consensus_problem","312454318_The_evolution_of_conventions","285281362_The_economy_as_a_complex_evolving_system_II","262312503_Distributed_Welfare_Games","250305105_The_Logit-Response_Dynamics","245360971_An_overview_of_collective_intelligence","243777612_Individual_Strategy_and_Social_Structure","238162251_A_Reinforcement_Procedure_Leading_to_Correlated_Equilibrium","232421807_The_Evolution_of_Conventions"]}
