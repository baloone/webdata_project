{"id":"220247686_Generalizations_of_1-deterministic_regular_languages","abstract":"We examine two generalizations of 1-deterministic regular languages that are used for the content models of DTDs in XML. They are k-lookahead determinism and k-block-determinism. The k-lookahead determinism uses the first k symbols w1w2⋯wk of the current input string as lookahead to process the first symbol w1. On the other hand, the k-block-determinism takes kw1w2⋯wk as lookahead and process the whole k symbols. We show that there is a hierarchy in k-lookahead determinism and there is a proper hierarchy in k-block-determinism. Moreover, we prove that k-block-deterministic regular languages are a proper subfamily of deterministic k-lookahead regular languages.","authors":["Yo-Sub Han","Derick Wood"],"meta":["September 2008Information and Computation 206(9-10):1117-1125","DOI:10.1016/j.ic.2008.03.013","SourceDBLP"],"references":["282901620_On_an_algorithm_of_synthesis_of_abstract_automats","253068166_The_Abstract_Theory_of_Automata","242637704_Information_processing-text_and_office_systems-standard_generalized_markup_language_SGML","242430394_The_theory_of_parsing_translation_and_compiling","228057764_Introduction_To_Automata_Theory_Languages_And_Computation","225345618_The_Generalization_of_Generalized_Automata_Expression_Automata","225126800_Block-Deterministic_Regular_Languages","224583682_Regular_Expressions_and_State_Graphs_for_Automata","223008371_One-Unambiguous_Regular_Languages","222726809_Characterization_of_Glushkov_automata","221568014_The_Generalization_of_Generalized_Automata_Expression_Automata","220980282_Regular_Expressions_into_Finite_Automata","220692321_Theory_of_computation","215863722_Extensible_Markup_Language_XML_10_Fourth_Edition","44493596_The_Theory_of_Parsing_Translation_and_Compiling_Vol_1_Parsing","3475958_Boolean_Matrices_and_the_Stability_of_Neural_Nets","3475950_Signal_Flow_Graph_Techniques_for_Sequential_Circuit_State_Diagrams","2814202_Deterministic_Generalized_Automata","2804002_Standard_Generalized_Markup_Language_Mathematical_and_Philosophical_Issues","2709375_Block-Deterministic_Regular_Languages"]}
