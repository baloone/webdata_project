{"id":"332815996_Safe_usage_of_registers_in_BSPlib","abstract":"Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP) is a simple but powerful high-level model for parallel computation. Using BSPlib, programmers can write BSP programs in the general purpose language C. Direct Remote Memory Access (DRMA) communication in BSPlib is enabled using registrations: associations between the local memories of all processes in the BSP computation. However, the semantics of registration is non-trivial and ambiguously specified and thus its faulty usage is a potential source of errors. We give a formal semantics of BSPlib with which we characterize correct registration. Anticipating a static analysis, we give a simplified programming model that guarantees correct registration usage, drawing upon previous work on textual alignment.","authors":["Arvid Jakobsson","Frédéric Dabrowski","Wadoud Bousdira"],"meta":["April 2019","DOI:10.1145/3297280.3297421","Conference: the 34th ACM/SIGAPP Symposium","Project: SPMD Program Analysis"],"references":["310741029_Apache_Hama_An_Emerging_Bulk_Synchronous_Parallel_Computing_Framework_for_Big_Data_Applications","277656433_BSP-Why_A_Tool_for_Deductive_Verification_of_BSP_Algorithms_with_Subgroup_Synchronisation","254001811_Introducing_OpenSHMEM_SHMEM_for_the_PGAS_community","224358601_Formal_Semantics_of_a_Subset_of_the_Paderborn's_BSPlib","326167026_Textual_alignment_in_SPMD_programs","321836598_C_PROGRAMMING_LANGUAGE","265002571_AN_OBJECT-ORIENTED_BULK_SYNCHRONOUS_PARALLEL_LIBRARY_FOR_MULTICORE_PROGRAMMING","260329376_An_object-oriented_bulk_synchronous_parallel_library_for_multicore_programming","222515921_The_Paderborn_university_BSP_PUB_library","222506723_BSPlib_the_BSP_programming_library"]}
