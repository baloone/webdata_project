{"id":"319895172_Localization_game_on_geometric_and_planar_graphs","abstract":"The main topic of this paper is motivated by a localization problem in cellular networks. Given a graph $G$ we want to localize a walking agent by checking his distance to as few vertices as possible. The model we introduce is based on a pursuit graph game that resembles the famous Cops and Robbers game. It can be considered as a game theoretic variant of the \\emph{metric dimension} of a graph. We provide upper bounds on the related graph invariant $\\zeta (G)$, defined as the least number of cops needed to localize the robber on a graph $G$, for several classes of graphs (trees, bipartite graphs, etc). Our main result is that, surprisingly, there exists planar graphs of treewidth $2$ and unbounded $\\zeta (G)$. On a positive side, we prove that $\\zeta (G)$ is bounded by the pathwidth of $G$. We then show that the algorithmic problem of determining $\\zeta (G)$ is NP-hard in graphs with diameter at most $2$. Finally, we show that at most one cop can approximate (arbitrary close) the location of the robber in the Euclidean plane.","authors":["Bartłomiej Bosek","Przemyslaw Gordinowicz","Jarosław Grytczuk","Nicolas Nisse"],"meta":["September 2017Discrete Applied Mathematics 251","DOI:10.1016/j.dam.2018.04.017"],"references":["224392598_A_Survey_of_Indoor_Positioning_Systems_for_Wireless_Personal_Networks","315454741_Locating_a_robber_with_multiple_probes","264960330_On_the_metric_dimension_of_a_graph","261726424_Locating_a_backtracking_Robber_on_a_tree","257145089_Locating_a_robber_on_a_graph_via_distance_queries","256935662_Graph_Searching_and_a_Min-Max_Theorem_for_Tree-Width","256694263_Locating_a_robber_on_a_graph","230595871_Graph_Searching_Path-Width_Tree-Width_and_Related_Problems_A_Survey","227859256_The_Game_of_Cops_and_Robbers_on_Graphs","223568384_Minimizing_the_size_of_an_identifying_or_locating-dominating_code_in_a_graph_is_NP-hard"]}
