{"id":"313362638_Semantic_modelling_of_user_interests_based_on_cross-folksonomy_analysis","abstract":"The continued increase in Web usage, in particular participation in folksonomies, reveals a trend towards a more dynamic and interactive Web where individuals can organise and share resources. Tagging has emerged as the de-facto standard for the organisation of such resources, providing a versatile and reactive knowledge management mechanism that users find easy to use and understand. It is common nowadays for users to have multiple profiles in various folksonomies, thus distributing their tagging activities. In this paper, we present a method for the automatic consolidation of user profiles across two popular social networking sites, and subsequent semantic modelling of their interests utilising Wikipedia as a multi-domain model. We evaluate how much can be learned from such sites, and in which domains the knowledge acquired is focussed. Results show that far richer interest profiles can be generated for users when multiple tag-clouds are combined","authors":["Martin Szomszor","Harith Alani","Iv√°n Cantador","Kieron O'Hara"],"meta":["October 2008","Conference: 7th International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC)Volume: 5318"],"references":[]}
