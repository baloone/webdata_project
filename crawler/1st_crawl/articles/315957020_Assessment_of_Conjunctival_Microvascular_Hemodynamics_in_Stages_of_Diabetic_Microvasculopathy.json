{"id":"315957020_Assessment_of_Conjunctival_Microvascular_Hemodynamics_in_Stages_of_Diabetic_Microvasculopathy","abstract":"Diabetes impairs the microcirculation and function of various vital tissues throughout the body. The conjunctival microcirculation can be non-invasively imaged and thus enables assessment of microvascular hemodynamics. In this study, alterations in conjunctival microvascular hemodynamics were quantitatively assessed at stages of increasing diabetic microvasculopathy based on diabetic retinopathy (DR). Subjects were categorized into non-diabetic control (C, N = 34), no clinically visible DR (NDR, N = 47), non-proliferative DR (NPDR, N = 45), and proliferative DR (PDR, N = 35). Conjunctival hemodynamic descriptors, namely vessel diameter (D), blood velocity (V), blood flow (Q), wall shear rate (WSR), and wall shear stress (WSS) were measured in arterioles and venules, and compared between DR and C subjects using generalized linear mixed models. In arterioles, V, WSR, and WSS were lower in NDR (P ≤ 0.01). V was lower in NDR than NPDR and PDR subjects (P ≤ 0.02). In venules, D was higher in NDR and NPDR (P ≤ 0.03), while V was lower in PDR (P = 0.04). Venular V and Q were higher in NPDR than PDR subjects (P ≤ 0.04). WSR and WSS were lower in all stages of DR (P ≤ 0.05), suggestive of the potential of WSS as a marker of diabetic microvasculopathy. Quantitative assessment of conjunctival hemodynamics can potentially be useful for evaluation of diabetic microvasculopathy.","authors":["Maziyar M Khansari","Justin Wanek","Michael Tan","Charlotte E Joslin"],"meta":["April 2017Scientific Reports 7(1):45916","DOI:10.1038/srep45916"],"references":["352297078_Correlation_of_conjunctival_microangiopathy_with_retinopathy_in_Type-2_diabetes_mellitus_T2DM_patients","304029739_Automated_fine_structure_image_analysis_method_for_discrimination_of_diabetic_retinopathy_stage_using_conjunctival_microvasculature_images","282765052_Automated_Assessment_of_Hemodynamics_in_the_Conjunctival_Microvasculature_Network","282659094_Wall_shear_stress_in_the_human_eye_microcirculation_in_vivo_segmental_heterogeneity_and_performance_of_in_vitro_cerebrovascular_models","277578400_Assesment_of_Conjunctival_Microangiopathy_in_a_Patient_with_Diabetes_Mellitus_Using_the_Retinal_Function_Imager","275036554_The_Association_Between_Skin_Blood_Flow_and_Edema_on_Epidermal_Thickness_in_the_Diabetic_Foot","266324313_Correlation_of_axial_blood_velocity_to_venular_and_arteriolar_diameter_in_the_human_eye_in_vivo","314672108_Microvascular_Perfusion_and_Transport_in_the_Diabetic_Heart","284827589_Diagnosis_and_Classification_of_Diabetes_Mellitus","274518280_Vascular_Mechanobiology"]}
