{"id":"318091190_Satellite-Based_Entanglement_Distribution_Over_1200_kilometers","abstract":"Long-distance entanglement distribution is essential for both foundational tests of quantum physics and scalable quantum networks. Owing to channel loss, however, the previously achieved distance was limited to ∼100 kilometers. Here we demonstrate satellite-based distribution of entangled photon pairs to two locations separated by 1203 kilometers on Earth, through two satellite-to-ground downlinks with a summed length varying from 1600 to 2400 kilometers. We observed a survival of two-photon entanglement and a violation of Bell inequality by 2.37 ± 0.09 under strict Einstein locality conditions. The obtained effective link efficiency is orders of magnitude higher than that of the direct bidirectional transmission of the two photons through telecommunication fibers.","authors":["Juan Yin","Yuan Cao","Yu-Huai Li","Liao Shengkai"],"meta":["June 2017Science 356(6343):1140-1144","DOI:10.1126/science.aan3211"],"references":["325205515_Space_QUEST_mission_proposal_Experimentally_testing_decoherence_due_to_gravity","304271794_Measurement_device_independent_quantum_key_distribution_over_404_km_optical_fibre","304244952_An_efficient_quantum_light-matter_interface_with_sub-second_lifetime","262023799_Detection_and_compensation_of_basis_deviation_in_satellite-to-ground_quantum_communications","255881438_Experimental_Test_of_Local_Hidden-Variable_Theories","243770307_Experimental_Realization_of_Teleporting_an_Unknown_Pure_Quantum_State_via_Dual_Classical_and_Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen_Channels","232718669_Direct_and_full-scale_experimental_verifications_towards_ground-satellite_quantum_key_distribution","230638093_Quantum_teleportation_and_entanglement_distribution_over_100-kilometre_free-space_channels","228109500_Proposed_Experiment_to_Test_Local_Hidden-Variable_Theories","228109475_Experimental_Realization_of_Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-Bohm_Gedankenexperiment_A_New_Violation_of_Bell's_Inequalities","227716852_Fundamental_quantum_optics_experiments_conceivable_with_satellites_-_Reaching_relativistic_distances_and_velocities","23222626_Experimental_demonstration_of_a_BDCZ_quantum_repeater_node","13237765_Teleporting_an_unknown_quantum_state_via_dual_classical_and_Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen_channels","13235592_''Event-ready-detectors''_Bell_experiment_via_entanglement_swapping","10745982_Atomic_Memory_for_Correlated_Photon_States","10699306_Long-Distance_Free-Space_Distribution_of_Quantum_Entanglement","7837732_Experimental_Free-Space_Distribution_of_Entangled_Photon_Pairs_Over_13_km_Towards_Satellite-Based_Global_Quantum_Communication","2203413_Violation_of_Bell's_Inequality_under_Strict_Einstein_Locality_Conditions","2185288_Feasible_Entanglement_Purification_for_Quantum_Communication","323130140_On_the_Einstein_Podolsky_Rosen_paradox","258806971_Air-to-ground_quantum_communication","258093563_Experimental_Entanglement_Swapping_Entangling_Photons_That_Never_Interacted","255863423_The_Angular_Correlation_of_Scattered_Annihilation_Radiation","243368993_Intrinsic_loss_of_optical_fibers","233835323_Quantum_Repeaters_The_Role_of_Imperfect_Local_Operations_in_Quantum_Communication","228109669_A_Single_Quantum_Cannot_be_Cloned","13245023_Ekert_AK_Quantum_Cryptography_Based_on_Bell's_Theorem_Phys_Rev_Lett_676_661","11635346_Long-distance_quantum_communication_with_atomic_ensembles_and_linear_optics","10747142_Experimental_entanglement_purification_of_arbitrary_unknown_states","6409030_Functional_Quantum_Nodes_for_Entanglement_Distribution_over_Scalable_Quantum_Networks","5391467_Observation_of_entanglement_between_a_single_trapped_atom_and_a_single_photon","5291818_The_Quantum_Internet"]}
