This grounded theory study sheds light on the various processes and contexts through which students constantly assess their self-efficacy as a programmer. The data consists of a series of four interviews conducted with a purposeful sample of nine computer science majors in a research intensive state university in the United States. Use of the constant comparative method elicited two forms of results. First, we identified six stages of doing a programming assignment. Analysis captures the dimensional variation in students' experiences with programming assignments on a detailed level. We identified a core category resulting from students' reflected emotions in conjunction with self-efficacy assessment. We provide a descriptive model of how computer science majors build their self-efficacy perceptions, reported via four narratives. Our key findings are that some students reflect negative views of their efficacy, even after having a positive programming experience and that in other situations, students having negative programming experiences still have a positive outlook on their efficacy. We consider these findings in light of possible languages and support structures for introductory programming courses.","authors":["PÃ¤ivi Kinnunen","Beth Simon"],"meta":["March 2012Computer Science Education 22(1):1-28","DOI:10.1080/08993408.2012.655091"],"references":["234827072_Instructional_design_of_a_programming_course_A_learning_theoretic_approach","232595132_Improving_Classroom_Learning_by_Collaboratively_Observing_Human_Tutoring_Videos_While_Problem_Solving","229049275_Experience_report_getting_novice_programmers_to_THINK_about_improving_their_software_development_process","228820766_Predictors_of_success_in_a_first_programming_course","228742435_What_do_CS_students_try_to_learn_insights_from_a_distributed_project-based_course_in_computer_systems","221538824_Evaluating_the_effectiveness_of_a_new_instructional_approach","221538023_Tracking_an_innovation_in_introductory_CS_education_from_a_research_university_to_a_two-year_college","220426817_Scratch_Programming_for_All","220094513_Communication_in_computer_science_classrooms_Understanding_defensive_climates_as_a_means_of_creating_supportive_behaviors","6477294_Implicit_Theories_of_Intelligence_Predict_Achievement_Across_an_Adolescent_Transition_A_Longitudinal_Study_and_an_Intervention","347881175_Peer_Instruction_Ten_years_of_experience_and_results","311463728_Tracking_an_innovation_in_introductory_CS_education_from_a_research_university_to_a_two-year_college","270960149_Research_Methods_In_Education","268001177_A_Study_of_Factors_Promoting_Success_in_Computer_Science","249020532_Action_research_as_narrative_Five_principles_for_validation","248437021_Naturalistic_inquiry_Beverly_Hills_CA_Sage_Publications_1985_416_pp_2500_Cloth","247928068_Building_theory_about_computing_education_phenomena_A_discussion_of_grounded_theory","247927487_The_same_but_different_Students'_understandings_of_primitive_and_object_variables","234772749_What_do_teachers_teach_in_introductory_programming","232517939_Motivated_and_Self-Regulated_Learning_Components_of_Classroom_Academic_Performance","230557429_Self-Efficacy_Mechanism_in_Human_Agency","228675359_Factors_affecting_the_success_of_non-majors_in_learning_to_program","221209643_Experiencing_programming_assignments_in_CS1","221209615_CS_majors'_self-efficacy_perceptions_in_CS1_Results_in_light_of_social_cognitive_theory","220808180_Effective_peer_assessment_for_learning_computer_programming","220094616_Special_issue_on_gender-balancing_computing_education","216743157_Peer_Instruction_Ten_Years_of_Experience_and_Results","200085837_Learning_and_Teaching_Programming_A_Review_and_Discussion"]}
