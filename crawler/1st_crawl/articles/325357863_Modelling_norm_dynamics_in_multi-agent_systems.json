{"id":"325357863_Modelling_norm_dynamics_in_multi-agent_systems","abstract":"Since multi-agent systems are inspired by human societies, they do not only borrow their coordination mechanisms such as conventions and norms, but also need to consider the processes that describe how norms come about, how they propagate in the society, and how they change over time.In the NorMAS community, this is best reflected in various norm life cycle conceptions that look at normative processes from a holistic perspective. While the earliest life cycle model emerged in the research field of international relations, the first life cycle model in the AI community has been proposed at the 2009 NorMAS Dagstuhl workshop by Savarimuthu and Cranefield [2009] and is based on a comprehensive survey of then existing contributions to the research field. Subsequently, two further models have been proposed that offer more refined accounts of the fundamental underlying processes.In this article, we review all existing norm life cycle models (Section 2), including the introduction of the individual life cycle models and their contextualization with specific contributions that exemplify life cycle processes.","authors":["Christopher K.
