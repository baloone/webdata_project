{"id":"318287485_Sliding_Mode_Block_Control_of_Uncertain_Nonlinear_Plants","abstract":"This paper combines the block control, sliding mode and high gain robust control techniques to form a stabilising control law for nonlinear systems with matched and unmatched uncertainties. A generalised observer is presented to cater for plants subjected to an unknown matched disturbance. The approach is applied to form a non-chatiering sliding-mode observer-based control law for robotic manipulators driven by DC motors.","authors":["Alexander G. Loukianov","Stephen J.
