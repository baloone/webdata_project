{"id":"333132374_Multi-version_Representation_of_Historical_Event","abstract":"The digital humanities are a field of research, teaching and engineering at the crossroads of computer science and the arts, literature, human and social sciences. Historical disciplines focus on digital tools, especially databases. Current interests and efforts focus on the representation of historical knowledge in order to facilitate the diffusion, sharing and exploitation of collective knowledge. In this context, we propose in this article a representation model of historical event. The particularity of our model is to represent simultaneously multiple versions of the same event from different sources. Furthermore, we discuss our model as a field of expertise for new research and investigation problems.","authors":["Fairouz Zendaoui","Walid Khaled Hidouci"],"meta":["June 2019","DOI:10.21533/pen.v7i1.329.g247","Project: Repr√©sentation des connaissances pour les faits historiques"],"references":["290545997_Semantic_Networks_and_Historical_Knowledge_Management_Introducing_New_Methods_of_Computer-based_Research","284575755_Semantic_technologies_for_historical_research_A_survey","276934861_History_on_the_semantic_web_as_linked_data-an_event_gazetteer_and_timeline_for_the_world_war_i","278761469_The_SyMoGIH_project_and_Geo-Larhra_A_method_and_a_collaborative_platform_for_a_digital_historical_atlas","243783696_La_Modelisation_des_Systemes_Complexes","30814668_The_CIDOC_CRM_an_Ontological_Approach_to_Schema_Heterogeneity"]}
