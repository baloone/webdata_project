{"id":"317420524_Fast_and_Efficient_Algorithms_for_Computational_Electromagnetics_on_GPU_Architecture","abstract":"Magnetic diagnostics are essential for the operation and understanding of a Magnetic Confinement Fusion device, for example by providing in real-time the axisymmetric measurements needed for plasma equilibrium reconstructions or MHD instabilities control. In this paper, we present a fast and robust implementation on GPU architecture of an accurate algorithm suitable for the computation of synthetic magnetic measurements used both in real time applications and off-line reconstruction procedures. The proposed procedure is firstly applied to benchmark problems, to validate the CUDA implementation, and then to cases of practical interests in MCF.","authors":["Tautvydas Maceina","Paolo Bettini","Gabriele Manduchi","Mauro Passarotto"],"meta":["June 2017IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TNS.2017.2713888"],"references":["306160410_Fast_computational_techniques_for_modeling_RFX-mod_fusion_devices_on_hybrid_CPU-GPU_architectures","260525352_Calculation_of_3-D_Magnetic_Fields_Produced_by_MHD_Active_Control_Systems_in_Fusion_Devices","220261727_A_Sparse_Matrix_Arithmetic_Based_on_H-Matrices_Part_I_Introduction_to_H-Matrices","51417694_Effects_of_Three-Dimensional_Electromagnetic_Structures_on_Resistive-Wall-Mode_Stability_of_Reversed_Field_Pinches","324350819_Methods_of_Mathematical_Physics_I","317565432_Modeling_of_the_magnetic_field_errors_of_RFX-mod_upgrade","316022242_Assessment_of_General_Purpose_GPU_Systems_in_Real-Time_Control","313464964_A_Volume_Integral_Formulation_for_Solving_Eddy_Current_Problems_on_Polyhedral_Meshes","283200319_Speed-up_of_Magnetic-Electric_Matrices_Assembly_Computation_by_Means_of_a_Multi_GPUs_Environment","258328496_Fast_magnetic_field_computation_in_fusion_technology_using_GPU_technology","239397962_Analytical_expressions_for_the_magnetic_field_of_practical_coils","230946830_Dynamic_simulator_of_RWM_control_for_fusion_devices_Modelling_and_experimental_validation_on_RFX-mod","224727294_Vector_potential_and_magnetic_field_of_current-carrying_finite_arc_segment_in_analytical_form_Part_III_Exact_computation_for_rectangular_cross_section","222454147_A_Fast_Algorithm_for_Particle_Simulation","216212379_Compact_expressions_for_the_Bio-Savart_fields_of_a_filamentary_segment","36965587_Methods_of_Mathematical_Physics","30398731_Magnetic_fields_and_potentials_of_linearly_varying_current_or_magnetization_in_a_plane_bounded_region","23464190_Resistive-Wall-Mode_Active_Rotation_in_the_RFX-Mod_Device","16365809_The_Solid_Angle_of_a_Plane_Triangle","3112922_Magnetic_Flux_Density_and_Vector_Potential_of_Uniform_Polyhedral_Sources","3096793_Analytical_Computation_of_Magnetic_Vector_Potential_from_Tetrahedral_Conductors","3096600_Analytic_Expressions_for_Magnetic_Field_from_Finite_Curved_Conductors","3095737_Simple_analytical_expressions_for_the_magnetic_field_of_current_coils","3095321_Vector_Potential_and_Magnetic_Field_of_Current-Carrying_Circular_Finite_Arc_Segment_in_Analytical_Form-Part_V_Polygon_Cross_Section","3016013_Potential_Integrals_for_Uniform_and_Linear_Source_Distributions_on_Polygonal_and_Polyhedral_Domains"]}
