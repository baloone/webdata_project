{"id":"272371332_Towards_Improving_Recommender_System_A_Social_Trust-Aware_Approach","abstract":"Recommender systems have shown great\npotential to help users find interesting and relevant Web\nservice (WS) from within large registers. However, with\nthe proliferation of WSs, recommendation becomes a\nvery difficult task. Social computing seems offering\ninnovative solutions to overcome those shortcomings.\nSocial computing is at the crossroad of computer sciences\nand social sciences disciplines by looking into ways of\nimproving application design and development using\nelements that people encounter daily such as social\nnetworks, trust, reputation, and recommendation. In this\npaper, we propose a social trust-aware system for\nrecommending Web services (WSs) based on social\nqualities of WSs that they exhibit towards peers at runtime,\nand trustworthiness of the users who provide\nfeedback on their overall experience using WSs. A set of\nexperiments to assess the fairness and accuracy of the\nproposed system are reported in the paper, showing\npromising results and demonstrating that our service\nrecommendation method significantly outperforms\nconventional similarity-based and trust-based service\nrecommendation methods.","authors":["Naziha Abderrahim","Sidi Mohamed Benslimane"],"meta":["February 2015International Journal of Modern Education and Computer Science 7(2):8-15","DOI:10.5815/ijmecs.2015.02.02","Project: Context in Recommender Systems"],"references":["269651541_Dynamic_Discovery_of_Web_Services_using_WSDL","249644044_Trust-Based_Service_Discovery_in_Multi-Relation_Social_Networks","238659575_A_Privacy_Trust_and_Policy_based_Authorization_Framework_for_Services_in_Distributed_Environments","290770909_Which_social_networks_should_web_services_sign-up_in","274573397_Constructing_a_Global_Social_Service_Network_for_Better_Quality_of_Web_Service_Discovery","263492027_Trust-Based_Personalized_Service_Recommendation_A_Network_Perspective","261088084_Identifying_Influential_Taggers_in_Trust-Aware_Recommender_Systems","261059629_Trust-Aware_Service_Recommendation_via_Exploiting_Social_Networks","254018222_STrust_A_Trust_Model_for_Social_Networks","254006557_Specifying_and_implementing_social_Web_services_operation_using_commitments"]}
