Evolutionary techniques are also known as nature inspired techniques as these types of techniques have stolen the idea from nature. Genetic algorithm (GA) is one of the most commonly used evolutionary techniques which is used to solve different NP-hard computational problems. GA is based upon the principle of human genetic. Past research shows that it has been effectively used to solve the different problems from the domain of Computer Science viz. software cost estimation, task scheduling, clustering, natural language processing, query optimization, image processing etc. In this paper, an effort is made to study the use and role of GA in Software Engineering, Distributed Computing, Query Optimization and Machine Learning. .","authors":["Samriti Sharma"],"meta":["January 2017International Journal of Computer Applications & Information Technology 9(2)"],"references":["303985271_Role_and_Working_of_Genetic_Algorithm_in_Computer_Science","301342138_Analysis_of_a_DSS_Queries_in_a_Distributed_Database_System","284281754_Design_and_analysis_of_stochastic_DSS_query_optimizers_in_a_distributed_database_system","282939652_Analysis_of_DSS_queries_using_entropy_based_restricted_genetic_algorithm","272864121_Stochastic_Analysis_of_DSS_Queries_for_a_Distributed_Database_Design","285751913_Heuristics_Based_Genetic_Algorithm_for_Scheduling_Static_Tasks_in_Homogeneous_Parallel_System","273517685_REDUCING_TRANSFER_COSTS_OF_FRAGMENTS_ALLOCATION_IN_REPLICATED_DISTRIBUTED_DATABASE_USING_GENETIC_ALGORITHMS","273453800_A_New_Approach_for_Software_Cost_Estimation_with_Hybrid_Genetic_Algorithm_and_Ant_Colony_Optimization","269801959_Software_Quality_Control_Based_on_Genetic_Algorithm","269670919_Role_and_Applications_of_Genetic_Algorithm_in_Data_Mining"]}
