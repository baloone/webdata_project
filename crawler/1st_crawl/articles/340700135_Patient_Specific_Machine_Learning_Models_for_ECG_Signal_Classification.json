{"id":"340700135_Patient_Specific_Machine_Learning_Models_for_ECG_Signal_Classification","abstract":"Arrhythmia is one of the major cause of deaths across the globe. Almost 17.9 million deaths are caused due to cardiovascular diseases. In order to reduce this much mortality rate, the cardiovascular disease should be properly identified and the proper treatment for the same should be immediately provided to the patients. In this study, a new ensemble based support vector machine (SVM) classifier was proposed to classify heartbeat into four classes from MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. The results were compared with other classifiers that are SVM, Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), and Long Short Term Memory network. The four features were extracted from the ECG signals that were used by the classifiers are Wavelets, high order statistics, R-R intervals and morphological features. An ensemble of SVMs obtained the best result with an overall accuracy of 94.4%.","authors":["Saroj Pandey","Rekh Ram Janghel","Vyom Vani"],"meta":["January 2020Procedia Computer Science 167(7334):2181-2190","DOI:10.1016/j.procs.2020.03.269"],"references":["327263145_Heartbeat_classification_fusing_temporal_and_morphological_information_of_ECGs_via_ensemble_of_classifiers","325657246_Classification_of_ECG_Arrhythmia_using_Recurrent_Neural_Networks","320090548_Non-invasive_Blood_Pressure_Estimation_Using_Phonocardiogram","319657639_Nonlinear_Cuffless_Blood_Pressure_Estimation_of_Healthy_Subjects_Using_Pulse_Transit_Time_and_Arrival_Time","315887144_A_novel_electrocardiogram_arrhythmia_classification_method_based_on_stacked_sparse_auto-encoders_and_softmax_regression","305924292_ECG_Classification_Using_Wavelet_Packet_Entropy_and_Random_Forests","326637801_ECG_Heartbeat_Classification_A_Deep_Transferable_Representation","311994830_Heartbeat_classification_using_projected_and_dynamic_features_of_ECG_signal","309917913_An_Automated_ECG_Beat_Classification_System_Using_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","288857675_ECG-based_Heartbeat_Classification_for_Arrhythmia_Detection_A_Survey"]}
