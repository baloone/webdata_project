{"id":"339221687_The_bi-criteria_seeding_algorithms_for_two_variants_of_k-means_problem","abstract":"The k-means problem is very classic and important in computer science and machine learning, so there are many variants presented depending on different backgrounds, such as the k-means problem with penalties, the spherical k-means clustering, and so on. Since the k-means problem is NP-hard, the research of its approximation algorithm is very hot. In this paper, we apply a bi-criteria seeding algorithm to both k-means problem with penalties and spherical k-means problem, and improve (upon) the performance guarantees given by the k-means++ algorithm for these two problems.","authors":["Min Li"],"meta":["February 2020Journal of Combinatorial Optimization","DOI:10.1007/s10878-020-00537-9"],"references":["336099916_The_seeding_algorithm_for_k-means_problem_with_penalties","332848250_The_seeding_algorithms_for_spherical_k-means_clustering","323857023_Local_search_approximation_algorithms_for_the_k-means_problem_with_penalties","311900754_Better_Guarantees_for_k-Means_and_Euclidean_k-Median_by_Primal-Dual_Algorithms","338717215_An_Improved_Approximation_Algorithm_for_the_k-Means_Problem_with_Penalties","334828845_Local_Search_Approximation_Algorithms_for_the_Spherical_k-Means_Problem","332411795_An_Improved_Approximation_Algorithm_for_the_k-Means_Problem_with_Penalties","325362194_An_improved_Density_Peaks_Clustering_Algorithm_with_Fast_Finding_Cluster_Centers","321066393_Better_Guarantees_for_k-Means_and_Euclidean_k-Median_by_Primal-Dual_Algorithms","310515572_Theoretical_Analysis_of_the_k-Means_Algorithm_-_A_Survey","303302046_A_Constant-Factor_Bi-Criteria_Approximation_Guarantee_for_k-means","309715704_Least_squares_quantization_in_PCM","305092466_The_effectiveness_of_lloyd-type_methods_for_the_k-means_problem","290130612_Spherical_k-Means_Clustering","281487160_Improved_and_Simplified_Inapproximability_for_k-means"]}
