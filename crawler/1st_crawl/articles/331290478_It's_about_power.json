{"id":"331290478_It's_about_power","abstract":"THIS COLUMN AIMS to build on and extend the field's understandings of the nature of ethics and equity in computing. Specifically, we argue that issues related to systems of power, which are often absent from conversations around ethics in computing, must be brought to the foreground in K-16 computing education. To this end, we argue for a justice-centered pedagogy ‚Åµ that centers power by explicitly acknowledging the ethical and political dimensions of computation and builds learning conditions so that everyone-including, but not limited to, students on computer science (CS) or engineering pathways-can understand, analyze, critique, and reimagine the technologies that shape everyday lives.","authors":["Sepehr Vakil","Jennifer Higgs"],"meta":["February 2019Communications of the ACM 62(3):31-33","DOI:10.1145/3306617"],"references":["274309848_Computational_Thinking","220420371_Computational_thinking","7574783_Ways_of_thinking_about_and_teaching_ethical_problem_solving_Microethics_and_macroethics_in_engineering","327109256_Algorithms_of_Oppression_How_Search_Engines_Reinforce_Racism","323743476_Ethics_Identity_and_Political_Vision_Toward_a_Justice-Centered_Approach_to_Equity_in_Computer_Science_Education","255573999_Stuck_in_the_Shallow_End_Education_Race_and_Computing","5998173_Some_Moral_and_Technical_Consequences_of_Automation"]}
