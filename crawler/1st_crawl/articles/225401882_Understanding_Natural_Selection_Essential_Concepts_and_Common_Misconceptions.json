{"id":"225401882_Understanding_Natural_Selection_Essential_Concepts_and_Common_Misconceptions","abstract":"Natural selection is one of the central mechanisms of evolutionary change and is the process responsible for the evolution\nof adaptive features. Without a working knowledge of natural selection, it is impossible to understand how or why living things\nhave come to exhibit their diversity and complexity. An understanding of natural selection also is becoming increasingly relevant\nin practical contexts, including medicine, agriculture, and resource management. Unfortunately, studies indicate that natural\nselection is generally very poorly understood, even among many individuals with postsecondary biological education. This paper\nprovides an overview of the basic process of natural selection, discusses the extent and possible causes of misunderstandings\nof the process, and presents a review of the most common misconceptions that must be corrected before a functional understanding\nof natural selection and adaptive evolution can be achieved.","authors":["T.
