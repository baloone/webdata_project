{"id":"30969544_Are_There_Genuine_Mathematical_Explanations_of_Physical_Phenomena","abstract":"Many explanations in science make use of mathematics. But are there cases where the mathematical component of a scientific explanation is explanatory in its own right? This issue of mathematical explanations in science has been for the most part neglected. I argue that there are genuine mathematical explanations in science, and present in some detail an example of such an explanation, taken from evolutionary biology, involving periodical cicadas. I also indicate how the answer to my title question impacts on broader issues in the philosophy of mathematics; in particular it may help platonists respond to a recent challenge by Joseph Melia concerning the force of the Indispensability Argument.","authors":["Alan Baker"],"meta":["April 2005Mind 114(454)","DOI:10.1093/mind/fzi223"],"references":["241518568_Paleoclimatic_Influences_in_the_Evolution_of_Periodical_Cicadas_Insecta_Homoptera_Cicadidae_Magicicada_Spp1","270299732_Indispensability_and_Practice","265702229_The_unreasonable_effectiveness_of_number_theory_in_physics_communication_and_music","265460009_Realism_Mathematics_and_Modality","260290372_Elementary_Number_Theory","249402619_Reasons_and_Motivation_Derek_Parfit","249258350_Response_to_Colyvan","249147847_On_Acting_Reasonably_Against_One's_Best_Judgment","246779471_Mathematics_and_Aesthetic_Considerations_in_Science","242312562_Nativism_empiricism_and_the_origins_of_knowledge"]}
