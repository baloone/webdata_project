{"id":"291078514_Bibliometric_Analysis_on_E-Sports_in_China","abstract":"Taking journal full-text database of CNKI(China National Knowledge Infrastructure) as data sources, the paper carried on statistical analysis on 151 papers on E-sports by September, 2010 from publishing years, journal distribution, author distribution, citation frequency, download frequency ,etc. to find questions of the research of E-sports and provide references for the research of E-sports in China. Through statistics, the author found research characteristics of E-sports in China: the number of papers creases rapidly since 2003; 50.30 percent of papers are published on journals of sports, but only 13.25 percent of papers are published on core journals; the research basis is weak, the research is still at the starting stage, emphasizes on theory but neglects practice. So the author puts forward suggestions including deepening the theoretical research, reducing the repeated research, emphasizing the practice research and introducing the foreign research on E-sports to promote the development of E-sports in China.","authors":["Zhang Guorui"],"meta":["January 2012","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-27948-5_16","In book: Advances in Computer Science and Engineering (pp.111-118)"],"references":[]}
