{"id":"234057482_Recommender_Systems_in_Technology_Enhanced_Learning","abstract":"Technology enhanced learning (TEL) aims to design, develop and test socio-technical innovations that will support and enhance\nlearning practices of both individuals and organisations. It is therefore an application domain that generally covers technologies\nthat support all forms of teaching and learning activities. Since information retrieval (in terms of searching for relevant\nlearning resources to support teachers or learners) is a pivotal activity in TEL, the deployment of recommender systems has\nattracted increased interest. This chapter attempts to provide an introduction to recommender systems for TEL settings, as\nwell as to highlight their particularities compared to recommender systems for other application domains.","authors":["Nikos Manouselis","Hendrik Drachsler","Riina Vuorikari","Hans Hummel"],"meta":["October 2011","DOI:10.1007/978-0-387-85820-3_12","In book: Recommender Systems HandbookChapter: Recommender Systems in Technology Enhanced Learning.Publisher: SpringerEditors: P.
