{"id":"303668799_Computational_Thinking_for_All_Pedagogical_Approaches_to_Embedding_21st_Century_Problem_Solving_in_K-12_Classrooms","abstract":"The recent focus on computational thinking as a key 21st century skill for all students has led to a number of curriculum initiatives to embed it in K-12 classrooms. In this paper, we discuss the key computational thinking constructs, including algorithms, abstraction, and automation. We further discuss how these ideas are related to current educational re- forms, such as Common Core and Next Generation Science Standards and provide specific means that would allow teachers to embed these ideas in their K-12 classrooms, in- cluding recommendations for instructional technologists and professional development experts for infusing computational thinking into other subjects. In conclusion, we suggest that computational thinking ideas outlined in this paper are key to moving students from merely being technology-literate to using computational tools to solve problems.","authors":["Aman Yadav","Hai Hong","Chris Stephenson"],"meta":["May 2016TechTrends 60(6)","DOI:10.1007/s11528-016-0087-7"],"references":["289834568_Rethinking_Technology_Creativity_in_the_21st_Century_Of_Art_Algorithms","282861505_Developing_Mathematical_Thinking_with_Scratch_An_Experiment_with_6th_Grade_Students","280732723_Creative_and_Computational_Thinking_in_the_Context_of_New_Literacies_Working_with_Teachers_to_Scaffold_Complex_Technology-Mediated_Approaches_to_Teaching_and_Learning","274309848_Computational_Thinking","262350755_Computational_Thinking_in_Elementary_and_Secondary_Teacher_Education","257692887_Rethinking_Technology_Creativity_in_the_21st_Century_A_Room_of_Their_Own","247924673_Bringing_computational_thinking_to_K-12_what_is_Involved_and_what_is_the_role_of_the_computer_science_education_community","265346995_Report_of_a_Workshop_of_Pedagogical_Aspects_of_Computational_Thinking","220420930_The_Profession_of_IT_Beyond_Computational_Thinking"]}
