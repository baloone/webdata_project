{"id":"308188632_A_Secure_One-Time_Password_Authentication_Scheme_Using_Image_Texture_Features","abstract":"The internet is a big giant in the todayâ€™s world playing the backbone for information and communication technologies. Most of the network application needs a very reliable and one-way authentication process to ensure system resources are securely accessed by authorised users over the Internet. Password-based authentication is the most common mechanism and is easy to implement for authentication purpose. However, such general scheme will be vulnerable to attackers to steal the static credential combination with ease using eavesdropping, brute forcing, password replay, etc. One-time password (OTP) is the promising solutions to overcome from such attacks. It generates the different unique passwords each time for the user login into the system. This paper proposes a novel method of OTP authentication using image features. Here the system calculates different features from randomly selected areas of an image and applies symmetric key cryptography to generate the random OTP for the user. The proposed approach is convenient and computationally less expensive offering high-level security.","authors":["Maitreya Maity","Dhiraj Manohar Dhane","Tushar Mungle","Rupak Chakraborty"],"meta":["September 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-981-10-2738-3_24","Conference: International Symposium on Security in Computing and Communication"],"references":["302341151_Textural_Features_for_Image_Classification","258651990_A_Web-accessible_Framework_for_Automated_Storage_with_Compression_and_Textural_Classification_of_Malaria_Parasite_Images","226565519_Weaknesses_and_Improvements_of_Kuo-Lee's_One-Time_Password_Authentication_Scheme","225986563_Unsupervised_texture_segmentation_using_feature_distributions","225045250_Gray_Level_Co-Occurrence_Matrices_Generalisation_and_Some_New_Features","220353130_Enhancing_Security_and_Privacy_in_Biometrics-Based_Authentication_Systems","3115759_Haralick_RM_Shanmuga_K_Dinstein_ITextural_features_for_image_classification_IEEE_Trans_Syst_Man_Cybern_3_610-621","303327914_Graphical_One-Time_Password_GOTPass_A_usability_evaluation","289684814_A_network_behavior_evaluation_method_for_improving_interactive_security_in_virtual_network_worlds","284776272_Password_authenticated_with_insecure_communication","261226177_Computer-assisted_approach_to_anemic_erythrocyte_classification_using_blood_pathological_information","247408780_A_One-Time_Password_System","242580957_An_Impersonation_Attack_on_One-Time_Password_Authentication_Protocol_OSPA","238180961_An_Efficient_Identification_Scheme_Based_on_Permuted_Kernels","237124163_Attacks_and_Solutions_on_Strong-Password_Authentication","234799654_Lamport_L_Password_Authentication_with_Insecure_Communication_Communications_of_the_ACM_24_770-772","222704608_An_improved_smart_card_based_password_authentication_scheme_with_provable_security","221355369_An_Efficient_Identification_Scheme_Based_on_Permuted_Kernels_Extended_Abstract","221318224_One-Time_Password_System_with_Infinite_Nested_Hash_Chains","221198733_PassPattern_System_PPS_A_Pattern-Based_User_Authentication_Scheme","220600789_Unsupervised_texture_segmentation_using_feature_distributions","50367398_Enhanced_Authentication_Mechanism_Using_Multilevel_Security_Model","2346870_The_SKEY_TM_one-time_password_system"]}
