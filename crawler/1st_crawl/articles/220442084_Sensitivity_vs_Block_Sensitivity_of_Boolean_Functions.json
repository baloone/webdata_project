{"id":"220442084_Sensitivity_vs_Block_Sensitivity_of_Boolean_Functions","abstract":"Senstivity and block sensitivity are important measures of complexity of Boolean functions. In this note we exhibit a Boolean function ofn variables that has sensitivity\nand block sensitivity Î©(n). This demonstrates a quadratic separation of the two measures.","authors":["David Rubinstein"],"meta":["June 1995Combinatorica 15(2):297-299","DOI:10.1007/BF01200762","SourceDBLP"],"references":["2508255_On_the_Degree_of_Boolean_Functions_as_Real_Polynomials","221590938_CREW_PRAMs_and_decision_trees","221349827_The_Complexity_of_Symmetric_Boolean_Functions","221149980_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","221084619_Improved_Upper_and_Lower_Time_Bounds_for_Parallel_Random_Access_Machines_Without_Simultaneous_Writes","220688436_The_Complexity_of_Boolean_Functions","220617172_Upper_and_Lower_Time_Bounds_for_Parallel_Random_Access_Machines_without_Simultaneous_Writes","3510314_Lower_bounds_for_the_complexity_of_reliable_Boolean_circuits_with_noisy_gates"]}
