{"id":"279870651_The_Incompleteness_Theorems","abstract":"This chapter discusses Hilbert's program, GÃ¶del's theorems, and formalized completeness theorem. It also discusses the encoding and some related topics followed by some generalizations of the Incompleteness Theorems. The concern is regarding metamathematical properties other than consistency. Further, two applications of the notions and results are presented in the chapter. The Incompleteness Theorems are obtained by formalizing Syntax. The chapter also discusses what happens when one formalizes Semantics. The chapter discusses the First Incompleteness Theorem and the Second Incompleteness Theorem and presents proof of the Incompleteness Theorems.","authors":["C.
