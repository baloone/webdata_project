{"id":"273348744_MAPK_feedback_encodes_a_switch_and_timer_for_tunable_stress_adaptation_in_yeast","abstract":"Signaling pathways can behave as switches or rheostats, generating binary or graded responses to a given cell stimulus. We evaluated whether a single signaling pathway can simultaneously encode a switch and a rheostat. We found that the kinase Hog1 mediated a bifurcated cellular response: Activation and commitment to adaptation to osmotic stress are switch-like, whereas protein induction and the resolution of this commitment are graded. Through experimentation, bioinformatics analysis, and computational modeling, we determined that graded recovery is encoded through feedback phosphorylation and a gene induction program that is both temporally staggered and variable across the population. This switch-torheostat signaling mechanism represents a versatile stress adaptation system, wherein a broad range of inputs generate an \"all-in\" response that is later tuned to allow graded recovery of individual cells over time.
