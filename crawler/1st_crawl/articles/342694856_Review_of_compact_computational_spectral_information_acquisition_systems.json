{"id":"342694856_Review_of_compact_computational_spectral_information_acquisition_systems","abstract":"With the development of computer science, more and more hardware implementations can be reproduced by software programming, bringing compact, cheap, and fast components to imaging instrumentation. In recent years, computational methods have been introduced into spectral detection, and computational spectrum acquisition implementations have emerged. This paper highlights the advantages of computational spectrum acquisition implementations by comparing them with traditional non-computational methods. Then, focusing on the compact feature, we review the most representative implementations, and finally make discussion and offer an outlook.","authors":["Hongya Song","Wenyi Zhang","Haifeng Li","Xu Liu"],"meta":["July 2020Frontiers of Information Technology & Electronic Engineering 21(8)","DOI:10.1631/FITEE.1900266"],"references":["331499741_Single-shot_on-chip_spectral_sensors_based_on_photonic_crystal_slabs","328463614_High-performance_and_scalable_on-chip_digital_Fourier_transform_spectroscopy","328208840_Compact_folded_metasurface_spectrometer","327632528_Experimental_demonstration_of_infrared_spectral_reconstruction_using_plasmonic_metasurfaces","325652790_Adaptive_filter_design_via_a_gradient_thresholding_algorithm_for_compressive_spectral_imaging","312341023_Etalon_Array_Reconstructive_Spectrometry","307949963_Ultra-portable_wireless_smartphone_spectrometer_for_rapid_non-destructive_testing_of_fruit_ripeness","325829574_The_first_result_of_Compressed_Channeled_Imaging_Spectropolarimeter","318793604_Coded_aperture_design_in_compressive_spectral_imaging_based_on_side_information","309452824_Adaptive_Nonlocal_Sparse_Representation_for_Dual-Camera_Compressive_Hyperspectral_Imaging"]}
