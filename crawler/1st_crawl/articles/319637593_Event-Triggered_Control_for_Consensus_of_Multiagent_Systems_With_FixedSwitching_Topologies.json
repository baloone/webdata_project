{"id":"319637593_Event-Triggered_Control_for_Consensus_of_Multiagent_Systems_With_FixedSwitching_Topologies","abstract":"In this paper, the leader-following consensus problem of high-order multiagent systems via event-triggered control is discussed. A novel distributed event-triggered communication protocol based on state estimates of neighboring agents is proposed to solve the consensus problem of the leader-following systems. We first investigate the consensus problem in a fixed topology, and then extend to the switching topologies. State estimates in fixed topology are only updated when the trigger condition is satisfied. However, state estimates in switching topologies are renewed with two cases: 1) the communication topology is switched or 2) the trigger condition is satisfied. Clearly, compared to continuous-time interaction, this protocol can greatly reduce the communication load of multiagent networks. Besides, the event-triggering function is constructed based on the local information and a new event-triggered rule is given. Moreover, \"Zeno behavior\" can be excluded. Finally, we give two examples to validate the feasibility and efficiency of our approach.","authors":["Zheng-Guang Wu","Y.
