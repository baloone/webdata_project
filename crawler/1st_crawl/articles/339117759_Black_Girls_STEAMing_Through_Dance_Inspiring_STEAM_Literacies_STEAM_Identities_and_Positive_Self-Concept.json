{"id":"339117759_Black_Girls_STEAMing_Through_Dance_Inspiring_STEAM_Literacies_STEAM_Identities_and_Positive_Self-Concept","abstract":"Black Girls STEAMing through Dance (BGSD) leverages a transdisciplinary partnership among four Black women professors in urban education, dance, industrial/product design, and computing to engage Black girls in a STEAM-infused program to inspire STEAM literacies, STEAM identities, and positive self-concept. BGSD is in its third year of existence and operates across several contexts, including an after-school program for 7- to 12-year-old Black girls, a co-curricular mini course program for 5th and 6th grade girls, and a professional development course for teachers. This chapter highlights how the program was developed and how the use of dance to integrate STEAM is a promising platform to encourage engaged STEAM participation amongst underrepresented Black girls.","authors":["Ayana Allen-Handy","Valerie Ifill","Raja Schaar","Michelle Rogers"],"meta":["January 2020","DOI:10.4018/978-1-7998-2517-3.ch008","In book: Challenges and Opportunities for Transforming From STEM to STEAM Education (pp.198-219)"],"references":["331538164_Computing_with_Relevance_and_Purpose_A_Review_of_Culturally_Relevant_Education_in_Computing","328216101_Black_girls_speak_STEM_Counterstories_of_informal_and_formal_learning_experiences","327167922_Virtual_and_augmented_reality_effects_on_K-12_higher_and_tertiary_education_students'_twenty-first_century_skills","324274201_Whiteness_as_Property_in_Science_Teacher_Education","323784217_Maximizing_Opportunities_to_Enroll_in_Advanced_High_School_Science_Courses_Examining_the_Scientific_Dispositions_of_Black_Girls","320034878_Teaching_Coding_to_Children_A_Methodology_for_Kids_5","315533472_Digital_Youth_Divas_Exploring_Narrative-Driven_Curriculum_to_Spark_Middle_School_Girls'_Interest_in_Computational_Activities","313014276_Virtual_realities_and_education","280157009_Intersectionality_and_STEM_The_Role_of_Race_and_Gender_in_the_Academic_Pursuits_of_African_American_Women_in_STEM","234647977_How_the_Perceived_Masculinity_andor_Femininity_of_Software_Applications_Influences_Students'_Software_Preferences","228346754_Whose_Culture_Has_Capital_A_Critical_Race_Theory_Discussion_of_Community_Cultural_Wealth","227830954_Science_Education_as_a_civil_right_Urban_schools_and_opportunity-to-learn_considerations","335378989_Routes_to_STEM_nurturing_Science_Technology_Engineering_and_Mathematics_in_early_years_education","325182171_Tech-Savvy_Girls_Learning_21st-Century_Skills_Through_STEAM_Digital_Artmaking","324253340_UnHidden_Figures_A_Synthesis_of_Research_Examining_the_Intersectional_Experiences_of_Black_Women_and_Girls_in_STEM_Education","309100128_Gender_and_choosing_a_STEM_major_in_college_Femininity_masculinity_chilly_climate_and_occupational_values_FEMININITY_MASCULINITY_AND_MAJORING_IN_A_STEM_FIELD","306927691_Representing_Racial_Identity_Identity_Race_the_Construction_of_the_African_American_STEM_Students","305628802_From_computational_thinking_to_computational_participation_in_K--12_education","299855389_A_Goal_Congruity_Model_of_Role_Entry_Engagement_and_Exit_Understanding_Communal_Goal_Processes_in_STEM_Gender_Gaps","294423966_Culturally_Responsive_School_Leadership_A_Synthesis_of_the_Literature","288795481_The_role_of_STEM_or_steam_in_the_early_childhood_setting","287298170_The_new_political_economy_of_urban_education_Neoliberalism_race_and_the_right_to_the_city","280559547_To_Block_or_not_to_Block_That_is_the_Question_Students'_Perceptions_of_Blocks-based_Programming","279865478_African_American_Cultural_Technology_The_Lindy_Hop_the_King_of_Pop_and_the_Factory_Worker's_Experience","277926242_Pipelines_and_Pathways_Women_of_Color_in_Undergraduate_STEM_Majors_and_the_College_Experiences_That_Contribute_to_Persistence","273523101_Embodying_Computational_Thinking_Initial_Design_of_an_Emerging_Technological_Learning_Tool","271625645_Culturally_responsive_computing_a_theory_revisited","265814456_Race_without_Racism_How_Higher_Education_Researchers_Minimize_Racist_Institutional_Norms","258198651_COMPUGIRLS'_Standpoint_Culturally_Responsive_Computing_and_its_Effect_on_Girls_of_Color","228376156_Women_Engineering_Students_and_Self-Efficacy_A_Multi-Year_Multi-Institution_Study_of_Women_Engineering_Student_Self-Efficacy"]}
