{"id":"334526467_OpenPose_Realtime_Multi-Person_2D_Pose_Estimation_Using_Part_Affinity_Fields","abstract":"Realtime multi-person 2D pose estimation is a key component in enabling machines to have an understanding of people in images and videos. In this work, we present a realtime approach to detect the 2D pose of multiple people in an image. The proposed method uses a nonparametric representation, which we refer to as Part Affinity Fields (PAFs), to learn to associate body parts with individuals in the image. This bottom-up system achieves high accuracy and realtime performance, regardless of the number of people in the image. In previous work, PAFs and body part location estimation were refined simultaneously across training stages. We demonstrate that using a PAF-only refinement is able to achieve a substantial increase in both runtime performance and accuracy. We also present the first combined body and foot keypoint detector, based on an annotated foot dataset that we have publicly released. We show that the combined detector not only reduces the inference time compared to running them sequentially, but also maintains the accuracy of each component individually. This work has culminated in the release of OpenPose, the first open-source realtime system for multi-person 2D pose detection, including body, foot, hand, and facial keypoints.","authors":["Zhe Cao","Gines Hidalgo Martinez","Tomas Simon","Shih-En Wei"],"meta":["July 2019IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TPAMI.2019.2929257"],"references":["338506497_PoseFix_Model-Agnostic_General_Human_Pose_Refinement_Network","329747444_Cascaded_Pyramid_Network_for_Multi-person_Pose_Estimation","328115645_MultiPoseNet_Fast_Multi-Person_Pose_Estimation_Using_Pose_Residual_Network_15th_European_Conference_Munich_Germany_September_8-14_2018_Proceedings_Part_XI","324996171_Using_a_Single_RGB_Frame_for_Real_Time_3D_Hand_Pose_Estimation_in_the_Wild","324584089_Simple_Baselines_for_Human_Pose_Estimation_and_Tracking","324055335_Multi-Scale_Structure-Aware_Network_for_Human_Pose_Estimation","320967386_Multi-context_Attention_for_Human_Pose_Estimation","319770123_Densely_Connected_Convolutional_Networks","318899328_Learning_Feature_Pyramids_for_Human_Pose_Estimation","316679944_VNect_Real-time_3D_Human_Pose_Estimation_with_a_Single_RGB_Camera","307897694_Human_Pose_Estimation_via_Convolutional_Part_Heatmap_Regression","307438996_Multi-Person_Pose_Estimation_with_Local_Joint-to-Person_Associations","301880946_Convolutional_Pose_Machines","287815055_SMPL_a_skinned_multi-person_linear_model","286662859_Multi-source_Deep_Learning_for_Human_Pose_Estimation","286513835_SSD_Single_Shot_MultiBox_Detector","284476297_DeepCut_Joint_Subset_Partition_and_Labeling_for_Multi_Person_Pose_Estimation","278048481_Flowing_ConvNets_for_Human_Pose_Estimation_in_Videos","269332682_2D_Human_Pose_Estimation_New_Benchmark_and_State_of_the_Art_Analysis","268451938_Efficient_Object_Localization_Using_Convolutional_Networks","330580980_Teaching_Robots_to_Predict_Human_Motion","329744026_Learning_to_Refine_Human_Pose_Estimation","329740178_CarFusion_Combining_Point_Tracking_and_Part_Detection_for_Dynamic_3D_Reconstruction_of_Vehicles","328143983_PersonLab_Person_Pose_Estimation_and_Instance_Segmentation_with_a_Bottom-Up_Part-Based_Geometric_Embedding_Model_15th_European_Conference_Munich_Germany_September_8-14_2018_Proceedings_Part_XIV","328128085_Deeply_Learned_Compositional_Models_for_Human_Pose_Estimation_15th_European_Conference_Munich_Germany_September_8-14_2018_Proceedings_Part_III","328124588_Pose-Normalized_Image_Generation_for_Person_Re-identification_15th_European_Conference_Munich_Germany_September_8-14_2018_Proceedings_Part_IX","328123222_Recycle-GAN_Unsupervised_Video_Retargeting_15th_European_Conference_Munich_Germany_September_8-14_2018_Proceedings_Part_V","328122453_Pose_Partition_Networks_for_Multi-person_Pose_Estimation_15th_European_Conference_Munich_Germany_September_8-14_2018_Proceedings_Part_V","322306456_Total_Capture_A_3D_Deformation_Model_for_Tracking_Faces_Hands_and_Bodies","320971374_ArtTrack_Articulated_Multi-Person_Tracking_in_the_Wild","320971305_Towards_Accurate_Multi-person_Pose_Estimation_in_the_Wild","320968047_Joint_Graph_Decomposition_Node_Labeling_Problem_Algorithms_Applications","320967941_YOLO9000_Better_Faster_Stronger","320964885_SpeedAccuracy_Trade-Offs_for_Modern_Convolutional_Object_Detectors","320963917_Realtime_Multi-person_2D_Pose_Estimation_Using_Part_Affinity_Fields","319770268_Joint_Training_of_a_Convolutional_Network_and_a_Graphical_Model_for_Human_Pose_Estimation","319769911_Faster_R-CNN_Towards_Real-Time_Object_Detection_with_Region_Proposal_Networks","316618055_Adversarial_PoseNet_A_Structure-aware_Convolutional_Network_for_Human_Pose_Estimation","316471350_Hand_Keypoint_Detection_in_Single_Images_using_Multiview_Bootstrapping","311299628_RMPE_Regional_Multi-person_Pose_Estimation","310440947_Associative_EmbeddingEnd-to-End_Learning_for_Joint_Detection_and_Grouping","308277497_DeeperCut_A_Deeper_Stronger_and_Faster_Multi-person_Pose_Estimation_Model","308277376_Stacked_Hourglass_Networks_for_Human_Pose_Estimation","302893439_Recurrent_Human_Pose_Estimation","289933059_Pose_Machines_Articulated_Pose_Estimation_via_Inference_Machines","286594663_Using_k-Poselets_for_Detecting_People_and_Localizing_Their_Keypoints","286512696_Deep_Residual_Learning_for_Image_Recognition","265385906_Very_Deep_Convolutional_Networks_for_Large-Scale_Image_Recognition","263930062_Articulated_Pose_Estimation_by_a_Graphical_Model_with_Image_Dependent_Pairwise_Relations","263002356_Microsoft_COCO_Common_Objects_in_Context","262177406_Using_Linking_Features_in_Learning_Non-parametric_Part_Models","261236793_Human_Pose_Estimation_Using_Body_Parts_Dependent_Joint_Regressors","261227384_Poselet_Conditioned_Pictorial_Structures","261160647_Articulated_people_detection_and_pose_estimation_Reshaping_the_future","259335300_DeepPose_Human_Pose_Estimation_via_Deep_Neural_Networks"]}
