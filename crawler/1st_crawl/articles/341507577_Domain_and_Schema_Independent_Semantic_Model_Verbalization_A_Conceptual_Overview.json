{"id":"341507577_Domain_and_Schema_Independent_Semantic_Model_Verbalization_A_Conceptual_Overview","abstract":"Semantic Web-based technologies have become extremely popular and its a success that has spread across many domains, additional to the computer science domain. Nevertheless, the reusability aspects associated with the created and available semantic knowledge models are very low. The main bottleneck associated with this issue is, the difficulty associated in understanding the complex schema of a knowledge model created and barriers associated with querying the knowledge models using SPARQL or SQWRL query formulations. This research emphasizes on proposing a verbalizer which can go beyond existing Controlled Natural Language (CNL) type verbalizers and to verbalizer knowledge stored in a knowledge model file written in either RDF or OWL format, despite its domain and schematics.","authors":["Kaneeka Vidanage","Noor Maizura","Mohamad Noor","Rosmayati Mohemad"],"meta":["May 2019International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications 10(5)"],"references":["312015882_Linked_Open_Vocabularies_LOV_A_gateway_to_reusable_semantic_vocabularies_on_the_Web","307546407_An_Approach_to_Ontology_Integration_for_Ontology_Reuse","306013732_Using_AberOWL_for_fast_and_scalable_reasoning_over_BioPortal_ontologies","292979738_Towards_Annotating_Potential_Incoherences_in_BioPortal_Mappings","330257087_Enhanced_Search_for_Arabic_Language_Using_Latent_Semantic_Indexing_LSI","328321489_Unsupervised_Machine_Learning_K-means_Clustering_Velocity_Semblance_Auto-Picking","326338429_Queries_with_Negation_and_Inequalities_over_Lightweight_Ontologies","313082025_Knowledge_management_and_knowledge_management_systems_conceptual_foundations_and_research_issues","309640529_Rake-Pmi_Automated_Keyphrase_Extraction_An_unsupervised_approach_for_automated_extraction_of_keyphrases","309269582_Health_Information_Systems_Evaluation_Frameworks_A_Systematic_Review","282556765_State_of_the_Art_of_Semantic_Web_for_Healthcare","288905495_Ontology_evaluation_for_reuse_in_the_domain_of_Process_Systems_Engineering","266320360_A_reference_ontology_for_profiling_scholar's_background_knowledge_in_recommender_systems","264530218_A_Decision_Support_System_Automated_Crime_Report_Analysis_and_Classification_for_e-Government","257404927_SWSNL_Semantic_web_search_using_natural_language"]}
