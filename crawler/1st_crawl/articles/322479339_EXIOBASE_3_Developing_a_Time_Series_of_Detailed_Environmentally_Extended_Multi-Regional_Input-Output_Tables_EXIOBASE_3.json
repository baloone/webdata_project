{"id":"322479339_EXIOBASE_3_Developing_a_Time_Series_of_Detailed_Environmentally_Extended_Multi-Regional_Input-Output_Tables_EXIOBASE_3","abstract":"Environmentally extended multiregional input-output (EE MRIO) tables have emerged as a key framework to provide a comprehensive description of the global economy and analyze its effects on the environment. Of the available EE MRIO databases, EXIOBASE stands out as a database compatible with the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA) with a high sectorial detail matched with multiple social and environmental satellite accounts. In this paper, we present the latest developments realized with EXIOBASE 3—a time series of EE MRIO tables ranging from 1995 to 2011 for 44 countries (28 EU member plus 16 major economies) and five rest of the world regions. EXIOBASE 3 builds upon the previous versions of EXIOBASE by using rectangular supply-use tables (SUTs) in a 163 industry by 200 products classification as the main building blocks. In order to capture structural changes, economic developments, as reported by national statistical agencies, were imposed on the available, disaggregated SUTs from EXIOBASE 2. These initial estimates were further refined by incorporating detailed data on energy, agricultural production, resource extraction, and bilateral trade. EXIOBASE 3 inherits the high level of environmental stressor detail from its precursor, with further improvement in the level of detail for resource extraction. To account for the expansion of the European Union (EU), EXIOBASE 3 was developed with the full EU28 country set (including the new member state Croatia). EXIOBASE 3 provides a unique tool for analyzing the dynamics of environmental pressures of economic activities over time.","authors":["Konstantin Stadler","Richard Wood","Tatyana Bulavskaya","Carl-Johan Södersten"],"meta":["January 2018Journal of Industrial Ecology 22(3)","DOI:10.1111/jiec.12715","Project: EU FP7th DESIRE"],"references":["323383978_Growth_in_Environmental_Footprints_and_Environmental_Impacts_Embodied_in_Trade_Resource_Efficiency_Indicators_from_EXIOBASE3_Growth_in_Environmental_Impacts_Embodied_in_Trade","323325353_Towards_Robust_Authoritative_Assessments_of_Environmental_Impacts_Embodied_in_Trade_Current_State_and_Recommendations_Robust_Assessments_of_Impacts_Embodied_in_Trade","321325633_Prioritizing_Consumption-Based_Carbon_Policy_Based_on_the_Evaluation_of_Mitigation_Potential_Using_Input-Output_Methods_Prioritizing_Consumption-Based_Carbon_Policies","316229687_Mapping_the_carbon_footprint_of_EU_regions","312604041_Resource_footprints_and_their_ecosystem_consequences_OPEN","312391376_The_last_frontiers_of_wilderness_Tracking_loss_of_intact_forest_landscapes_from_2000_to_2013","306434799_Sixteen_years_of_change_in_the_global_terrestrial_human_footprint_and_implications_for_biodiversity_conservation","309582196_Estimating_CO2_Emissions_Embodied_in_Final_Demand_and_Trade_Using_the_OECD_ICIO_2015_Methodology_and_Results","308891615_A_network_approach_for_assembling_and_linking_input-output_models","306250787_Environmental_and_resource_footprints_in_a_global_context_Europe's_structural_deficit_in_resource_endowments"]}
