{"id":"305619713_Business_process_flexibility_-_a_systematic_literature_review_with_a_software_systems_perspective","abstract":"Business Process flexibility supports organizations in changing their everyday work activities to remain competitive. Since much research has been done on this topic a better awareness on the current state of knowledge is needed. This paper reports the results of a systematic literature review to develop a map on Business Process flexibility with a special focus on software systems related aspects. It covers a spectrum of the state of the art from academic point of view. It includes 164 research works from the main computer science digital libraries. After an introduction into the topic the applied methodology is described. The output of the paper is in the form of schemes and reflections. Starting from the needs for Business Process flexibility, its impact on Business Process life-cycle is introduced. Successively instruments used to express and to support Business Process flexibility are presented together with related validation scenarios. In this paper we also highlight possible future research lines needing further investigations. In particular we identified room for future works in the area of languages for modeling flexibility, on-the-fly verification solutions, adaptation of Business Process running instances, and techniques for evolution recognition.","authors":["Barbara Re","Flavio Corradini","Stefania Gnesi","Andrea Polini"],"meta":["April 2018Information Systems Frontiers 20(2)","DOI:10.1007/s10796-016-9678-2"],"references":["314980157_Business_Process_Variability_Modeling_A_Survey","302924724_Guidelines_for_performing_Systematic_Literature_Reviews_in_Software_Engineering","286592740_A_Case_for_Declarative_Process_Modelling_Agile_Development_of_a_Grant_Application_System","333964845_Business_Process_Management_Concepts_Languages_Architectures","300885999_Declarative_Process_Modeling_in_BPMN","300586569_Modeling_Design-Time_Variability_in_Business_Processes_Existing_Support_and_Deficiencies","289918669_A_Model_for_Dynamic_Business_Processes_and_Process_Changes","289642410_Towards_configurable_data_collection_for_sustainable_supply_chain_communication","282595905_Business_Process_Model_and_Notation_BPMN","278710954_Enhancing_Modeling_and_Change_Support_for_Process_Families_through_Change_Patterns","276197737_A_Systematic_Mapping_Study_on_Business_Process_Variability","275539063_Business_Process_Model_Reasoning_From_Workflow_to_Case_Management","275539060_Flexibility_in_Cross-organizational_WS-BPEL_Business_Processes","275519988_Using_Data-Object_Flow_Relations_to_Derive_Control_Flow_Variants_in_Configurable_Business_Processes","278699051_Towards_a_Better_Understanding_of_Context_and_Context-Awareness"]}
