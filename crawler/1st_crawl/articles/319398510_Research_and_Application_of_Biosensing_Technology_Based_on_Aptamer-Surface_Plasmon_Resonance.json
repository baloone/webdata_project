{"id":"319398510_Research_and_Application_of_Biosensing_Technology_Based_on_Aptamer-Surface_Plasmon_Resonance","abstract":"The aptamers have been widely used in biomolecule recognition because of their advantages of synthesis, modification and immobilization. The sensing technology developed by surface plasmon resonance(SPR) has the advantages of non-labeling, no pretreatment, real-time monitoring. The sensors based on aptamer and SPR have important application values in biosensing techniques. The applications of biosensor based on aptamer-SPR are reviewed in this paper.","authors":["杜斌 DU Bin","童朝阳 TONG Zhao-yang","刘志伟 LIU Zhi-wei","穆晞惠 MU Xi-hui"],"meta":["August 2017Chinese Journal of Luminescence 38(8):1039-1046","DOI:10.3788/fgxb20173808.1039"],"references":[]}
