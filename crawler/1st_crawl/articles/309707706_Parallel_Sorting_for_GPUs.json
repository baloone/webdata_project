{"id":"309707706_Parallel_Sorting_for_GPUs","abstract":"Selim Akl has been a ground breaking pioneer in the field of parallel sorting algorithms. His ‘Parallel Sorting Algorithms’ book [12], published in 1985, has been a standard text for researchers and students. Here we discuss recent advances in parallel sorting methods for many-core GPUs. We demonstrate that parallel deterministic sample sort for GPUs (GPU Bucket Sort) is not only considerably faster than the best comparison-based sorting algorithm for GPUs (Thrust Merge) but also as fast as randomized sample sort for GPUs (GPU Sample Sort). However, deterministic sample sort has the advantage that bucket sizes are guaranteed and therefore its running time does not have the input data dependent fluctuations that can occur for randomized sample sort.","authors":["Frank Dehne","Hamidreza Zaboli"],"meta":["November 2017","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-46376-6_12","In book: Emergent Computation (pp.293-302)"],"references":["221214289_GPUTeraSort_High_Performance_Graphics_Coprocessor_Sorting_for_Large_Database_Management","220951290_Designing_efficient_sorting_algorithms_for_manycore_GPUs","4245470_GPU-ABiSort_optimal_parallel_sorting_on_stream_architectures","271416717_GPUTeraSort","236413483_Parallel_sorting_algorithms","225806341_A_Practical_Quicksort_Algorithm_for_Graphics_Processors","224140665_GPU_sample_sort","222516632_Fast_Parallel_GPU-sorting_using_a_Hybrid_Algorithm","222468695_Parallel_sorting_by_regular_sampling","220639794_GPU-Quicksort_A_practical_Quicksort_algorithm_for_graphics_processors","220617852_Adaptive_Bitonic_Sorting_An_Optimal_Parallel_Algorithm_for_Shared-Memory_Machines","3216496_NVIDIA_Tesla_A_unified_graphics_and_computing_architecture"]}
