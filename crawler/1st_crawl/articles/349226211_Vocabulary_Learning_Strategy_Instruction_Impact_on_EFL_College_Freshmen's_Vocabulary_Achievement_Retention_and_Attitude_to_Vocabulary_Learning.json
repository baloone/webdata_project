{"id":"349226211_Vocabulary_Learning_Strategy_Instruction_Impact_on_EFL_College_Freshmen's_Vocabulary_Achievement_Retention_and_Attitude_to_Vocabulary_Learning","abstract":"The current study investigated the impact of vocabulary learning (VL) strategy instruction on EFL college freshmen's vocabulary achievement, retention and attitude to VL. Sixty two Saudi students enrolled in the first level at Al-Quwyi'yah Community College (Computer Science Section) in the academic year 2009-2010 were assigned to an experimental group and a control group, each consisting of 32 students. A vocabulary pretest and an attitude to VL questionnaire were administered to the two groups. The two groups were homogenous in relation to vocabulary achievement and attitude to VL. A one-semester intervention was then carried out where the experimental group was taught VL strategies. The control group was taught the same vocabulary without direct strategy instruction. The experimental group outperformed the control group on a vocabulary posttest, a vocabulary delayed posttest, and the attitude questionnaire, hence supporting the potential of VL strategy instruction for promoting EFL learners' lexicon.","authors":["Mohammed Hassan","Kassem Kassem","Hassan Kassem"],"meta":["February 2021"],"references":["285696531_Language_attitudes_of_Turkish_students_towards_the_English_language_and_its_use_in_Turkish_context","258166247_Vocabulary_Instruction_for_Students_with_Learning_Disabilities_A_Review_of_the_Research","323281503_Learning_Vocabulary_in_Another_Language","296320164_Vocabulary_instruction_Concerns_and_visions","293767564_Attitudes_toward_academic_writing_of_foundation_students_at_an_australian-based_University_in_Sarawak","272887229_Metacognitive_strategy_training_for_vocabulary_learning","270303233_Language_Learning_Strategies_What_Every_Teacher_Should_Know","260353907_L2_Vocabulary_Learning_From_Context_Strategies_Knowledge_Sources_and_Their_Relationship_With_Success_in_L2_Lexical_Inferencing","256568205_Second_language_vocabulary_learning_among_adults_State_of_the_art_in_vocabulary_instruction","254771822_Incidental_Vocabulary_Learning_by_Advanced_Foreign_Language_Students_The_Influence_of_Marginal_Glosses_Dictionary_Use_and_Reoccurrence_of_Unknown_Words","239934894_Reading_Attitudes_in_L1_and_L2_and_Their_Influence_on_L2_Extensive_Reading","253366125_A_Comparison_of_Inferencing_and_Meaning-guessing_of_New_Lexicon_in_Context_versus_Non-context_Vocabulary_Presentation","253130714_A_Framework_for_Developing_EFL_Reading_Vocabulary","250733992_Learners'_independent_records_of_vocabulary","240738635_Retention_of_foreign_vocabulary_learned_using_the_Keyword_method_A_ten_year_follow-up"]}
