{"id":"343331303_Khan_academy_effectiveness_The_case_of_math_secondary_students'_perceptions","abstract":"It is argued that Khan Academy (KA) is a useful platform for learning math. However, little research has been conducted on how learners perceive using KA. The case study examined the effectiveness of KA combined with traditional learning, as perceived by secondary students (N = 27) in math. Qualitative tools included a reflective diary accompanied by semi-structured interviews. Main categories emerging from content analysis were the teacher, the student, teacher-student relations, subject and content, and learning environment. Main findings show: 1. students perceived themselves as independent learners, investing in and aware of their functions as learners, more committed to the subject of math. 2. Teachers using KA were perceived as more professional, dedicated, connected to students' needs, and innovative. 3. KA was perceived as encouraging independence, available, and more interesting than books. 4. Learning math via KA was more motivating and enjoyable. 5. The teacher-student relationship was the emotional and motivational basis perceived as more important than the innovative learning environment. The main conclusion is that KA is effective in promoting personalization, independence and innovative teaching-learning processes. However, the teacher's mediation of cognitive and emotional learning is crucial. Hence, teachers should exploit KA while creating and maintaining direct lines of teacher-student interaction.","authors":["Hava Ester Vidergor","Paz Ben-Amram"],"meta":["July 2020Computers & Education 157(3):103985","DOI:10.1016/j.compedu.2020.103985"],"references":["330925794_Students'_Approaches_to_Massive_Open_Online_Courses_The_Case_of_Khan_Academy","326195259_Students'_learning_performance_and_perceived_motivation_in_gamified_flipped-class_instruction","318789847_Improving_High-Level_Thinking_Skills_by_Development_of_Learning_PBL_Approach_on_the_Learning_Mathematics_for_Senior_High_School_Students","318089173_Researching_Student_Motivation","317696965_New_Paper_The_Effects_of_Computer_Programming_on_high_school_students'_reasoning_skills_and_self-efficacy_and_problem_solving_in_Mathematics","317634204_Khan_Academy_as_Supplemental_Instruction_A_Controlled_Study_of_a_Computer-Based_Mathematics_Intervention","286047548_The_Impact_of_the_Flipped_Classroom_on_Mathematics_Concept_Learning_in_High_school","284904065_Sample_Size_in_Qualitative_Interview_Studies_Guided_by_Information_Power","276856965_Perceived_Usefulness_of_Flipped_Learning_on_Instructional_Design_for_Elementary_and_Secondary_Education_With_Focus_on_Pre-service_Teacher_Education","273415099_ALAS-KA_A_Learning_Analytics_Extension_for_Better_Understanding_the_Learning_Process_in_the_Khan_Academy_Platform","272202337_Increasing_Student_Engagement_in_Math_The_Use_of_Khan_Academy_in_Chilean_Classrooms","269777672_Effects_of_the_handheld_technology_instructional_approach_on_performances_of_students_of_different_achievement_levels","261961212_Khan_Academy_gamifies_computer_science","228949732_Self_organising_systems_for_mass_computer_literacy_Findings_from_the_'hole_in_the_wall'_experiments","347051099_Using_Learning_Logs_in_Mathematics_Writing_to_Learn","344303532_The_who_what_and_where_of_learning_strategies","339095955_Enhancing_STEM_competence_by_making_electronic_musical_pencil_for_non-engineering_students","313493602_The_Math_Anxiety-Performance_Link_A_Global_Phenomenon","311551244_Some_Guidance_on_Conducting_and_Reporting_Qualitative_Studies","303255866_The_interview_From_structured_questions_to_negotiated_text","290469147_Flip_or_Flop_Are_Math_Teachers_Using_Khan_Academy_as_Envisionedby_Sal_Khan","284359145_Quality_of_Qualitative_Research_in_the_Health_Sciences_Analysis_of_the_Common_Criteria_Present_in_58_Assessment_Guidelines_by_Expert_Users","282070707_Blending_Instruction_with_Khan_Academy"]}
