{"id":"339221315_Is_Big_Digital_Data_Different_Towards_a_New_Archaeological_Paradigm","abstract":"Archaeological data is always incomplete, frequently unreliable, often replete with unknown unknowns, but we nevertheless make the best of what we have and use it to build our theories and extrapolations about past events. Is there any reason to think that digital data alter this already complicated relationship with archaeological data? How does the shift to an infinitely more flexible, fluid digital medium change the character of our data and our use of it? The introduction of Big Data is frequently said to herald a new epistemological paradigm, but what are the implications of this for archaeology? As we are increasingly subject to algorithmic agency, how can we best manage this new data regime? This paper seeks to unpick the nature of digital data and its use within a Big Data environment as a prerequisite to rational and appropriate digital data analysis in archaeology, and proposes a means towards developing a more reflexive, contextual approach to Big Data.","authors":["Jeremy Huggett"],"meta":["February 2020Journal of Field Archaeology 45(sup1):S8-S17","DOI:10.1080/00934690.2020.1713281"],"references":["352294974_Towards_a_New_Paradigm_The_Third_Science_Revolution_and_its_Possible_Consequences_in_Archaeology","348936149_Imagined_Affordance_Reconstructing_a_Keyword_for_Communication_Theory","332832750_Corrected_analyses_show_that_moralizing_gods_precede_complex_societies_but_serious_data_concerns_remain","331911449_Complex_societies_precede_moralizing_gods_throughout_world_history","330346108_The_social_life_of_data_points_Antecedents_of_digital_technologies","335698985_Reply_to_Beheim_et_al_Reanalyses_confirm_robustness_of_original_analyses","333891139_Archaeology_digital_cartography_and_the_question_of_progress","331633024_The_Data_Gaze_Capitalism_Power_and_Perception","331215742_Knowledge_production_with_data_from_archaeological_excavations","329648337_The_Stuff_of_Bits_An_Essay_on_the_Materialities_of_Information"]}
