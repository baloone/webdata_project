{"id":"315118127_Improving_TSP_Tours_Using_Dynamic_Programming_over_Tree_Decompositions","abstract":"Given a traveling salesman problem (TSP) tour H in graph G, a k-move is an operation that removes k edges from H and adds k edges of G so that a new tour H′ is formed. The popular k-OPT heuristic for TSP finds a local optimum by starting from an arbitrary tour H and then improving it by a sequence of k-moves.\nUntil 2016, the only known algorithm to find an improving k-move for a given tour was the naive solution in time O(nk). At ICALP’16, de Berg, Buchin, Jansen, and Woeginger showed an O(n⌊2k/3⌋+1)-time algorithm.\nWe show an algorithm that runs in O(n(1/4+&epsi;k)k) time, where limk→ ∞ &epsi;k &equals; 0. It improves over the state of the art for every k ≥ 5. For the most practically relevant case k &equals; 5, we provide a slightly refined algorithm running in O(n3.4) time. We also show that for the k &equals; 4 case, improving over the O(n³)-time algorithm of de Berg et al. would be a major breakthrough: An O(n3−&epsis;)-time algorithm for any &epsis; > 0 would imply an O(n3−δ)-time algorithm for the All Pairs Shortest Paths problem, for some δ > 0.","authors":["Marek Cygan","Lukasz Kowalik","Arkadiusz Socała"],"meta":["March 2017ACM Transactions on Algorithms 15(4)","DOI:10.1145/3341730"],"references":["313903170_Parameterized_Algorithms","305186325_Fine-grained_Complexity_Analysis_of_Two_Classic_TSP_Variants","303170286_Computer_solutions_of_the_traveling_salesman_problem","300779772_Towards_Understanding_the_Smoothed_Approximation_Ratio_of_the_2-Opt_Heuristic","287661759_An_effective_heuristic_algorithm_for_the_traveling_salesman_problem","267090795_Smoothed_Analysis_of_the_2-Opt_Heuristic_for_the_TSP_Polynomial_Bounds_for_Gaussian_Noise","259860850_A_Dynamic_Programming_Approach_to_Sequencing_Problems","256221965_How_Easy_Is_Local_Search","242618050_A_Branch-and-Cut_Algorithm_for_the_Resolution_of_Large-Scale_Symmetric_Traveling_Salesman_Problems","235067784_Worst-Case_Analysis_of_a_New_Heuristic_for_the_Traveling_Salesman_Problem"]}
