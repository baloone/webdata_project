{"id":"258727308_Ambiguity_of_I-Languages_of_Turing_Machines","abstract":"An {\\omega}-language is a set of infinite words over a finite alphabet X. We\nconsider the class of recursive {\\omega}-languages, i.e. the class of\n{\\omega}-languages accepted by Turing machines with a B\\\"uchi acceptance\ncondition, which is also the class {\\Sigma}11 of (effective) analytic subsets\nof X{\\omega} for some finite alphabet X. We investigate here the notion of\nambiguity for recursive {\\omega}-languages with regard to acceptance by B\\\"uchi\nTuring machines. We first present in detail essentials on the literature on\n{\\omega}-languages accepted by Turing Machines. Then we give a complete and\nbroad view on the notion of ambiguity and unambiguity of B\\\"uchi Turing\nmachines and of the {\\omega}-languages they accept. To obtain our new results,\nwe make use of results and methods of effective descriptive set theory.","authors":["Olivier Finkel"],"meta":["September 2012Logical Methods in Computer Science 10(3)","DOI:10.2168/LMCS-10(3:12)2014"],"references":["264968612_P_1_1_Borel_sets","250655854_Acceptance_of_o-Languages_by_Communicating_Deterministic_Turing_Machines","222185625_X-automata_on_o-words","1905645_Topology_and_Ambiguity_in_Omega_Context_Free_Languages","269024497_Infinite_Words_Automata_Semigroups_Logic_and_Games","265455313_Classical_Descriptive_Set_Theory","262348135_o-Languages","250796674_Borel_Ranks_and_Wadge_Degrees_of_Context_Free_Omega_Languages","242096448_A_Glimm-Effros_Dichotomy_for_Borel_Equivalence_Relations","238836878_Wadge_Degrees_of_Languages_of_DeterministicTuring_Machines","230481153_Rekursive_Folgenmengen_I","229761032_Nondeterministic_O-Computations_and_the_Analytical_Hierarchy","229334041_o-Computations_on_Turing_machines","228820768_Topology_and_ambiguity_in_o-context_free_languages","225883137_On_the_Power_of_Reading_the_Whole_Infinite_Input_Tape","222572439_Classical_and_Effective_Descriptive_Complexities_of_o-Powers","222528083_Ambiguity_in_Omega_Context_Free_Languages","220897519_Topological_Characterizations_of_Infinite_Behaviours_of_Transition_Systems","50334114_Descriptive_Set_Theory","45876913_The_Complexity_of_Infinite_Computations_In_Models_of_Set_Theory","23717038_Highly_Undecidable_Problems_For_Infinite_Computations","2832679_Context-Free_Languages_and_Pushdown","2822069_On_the_Power_of_Reading_the_Whole_Infinite_Input_Tape","2667397_Logical_Specifications_of_Infinite_Computations","2637180_Recursive_Automata_on_Infinite_Words","2401897_Context-Free_Languages_and_Push-Down_Automata"]}
