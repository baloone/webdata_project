{"id":"311317587_Successful_accreditation_of_the_Electrical_Engineering_Program_offered_in_two_campuses_at_Caribbean_University","abstract":"The Electrical Engineering Bachelor Program at Caribbean University, which is offered in two different campuses (Bayamon and Ponce - Puerto Rico), underwent a successful ABET accreditation during cycle 2014â€“2015, its first time evaluation. During the process it was difficult to find useful information or guidelines for programs offered in more than one location, which represented a challenge for both the EE program and evaluators. This paper presents an overview of our assessment plan, strategies to assess and evaluate the program, and a description of assessment instruments. In addition, a summary of materials for the display room and practices to strengthen continuous improvement of the program to meet accreditation and constituency are included as well, and could be useful information to help other institutions to prepare engineering programs for an eventual on-site ABET visit.","authors":["Hermes E.
