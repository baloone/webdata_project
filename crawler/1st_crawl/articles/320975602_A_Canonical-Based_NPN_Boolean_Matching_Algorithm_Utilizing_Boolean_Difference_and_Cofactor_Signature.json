{"id":"320975602_A_Canonical-Based_NPN_Boolean_Matching_Algorithm_Utilizing_Boolean_Difference_and_Cofactor_Signature","abstract":"This paper presents a new compact canonical-based algorithm to solve the problem of single-output completely specified NPN Boolean matching. We propose a new signature vector Boolean difference and cofactor (DC) signature vector. Our algorithm utilizes the Boolean difference, cofactor signature and symmetry properties to search for canonical transformations. The use of symmetry and Boolean difference notably reduces the search space and speeds up the Boolean matching process compared to the algorithm proposed in [1]. We tested our algorithm on a large number of circuits. The experimental results showed that the average runtime of our algorithm 37% higher and its average search space 67% smaller compared to [1] when tested on general circuits.","authors":["Juling Zhang","Guowu Yang","William N.
