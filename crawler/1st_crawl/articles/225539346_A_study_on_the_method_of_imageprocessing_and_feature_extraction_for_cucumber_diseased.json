At first, vector\nmedian filter for color images was applied to remove noise, and then chromaticity moments were extracted as texture feature.\nExperimental results show that vector median filter for color images can remove the noise of diseased leaf with efficiency,\nand the adoption of chromaticity moments as texture feature of color image is simple and rapid, which had good recognition\neffect.","authors":["Youwen Tian","Yan Niu","Tianlai Li"],"meta":["June 2009","DOI:10.1007/978-1-4419-0211-5_21","Conference: International Conference on Computer and Computing Technologies in Agriculture"],"references":["272609965_Signal_Processing_Based_on_Mathematical_Morphology"]}
