{"id":"332134522_Deep-Full-Range_A_Deep_Learning_Based_Network_Encrypted_Traffic_Classification_and_Intrusion_Detection_Framework","abstract":"With the rapid evolution of network traffic diversity, the understanding of network traffic has become more pivotal and more formidable. Previously, traffic classification and intrusion detection require a burdensome analyzing of various traffic features and attack-related characteristics by experts, even private information might be required. However, due to the outdated features labeling and privacy protocols, existing approaches may not fit with the characteristics of the changing network environment anymore. In this paper, we present a light-weight framework with the aid of deep learning for encrypted traffic classification and intrusion detection, termed Deep-Full-Range (DFR). Thanks to deep learning, DFR is able to learn from raw traffic without manual intervention and private information. In such a framework, our proposed algorithms are compared with other state-of-art methods using two public datasets. Experimental results show that our framework not only can outperform state-of-art methods by averaging 13.49 % on encrypted traffic classification’s F1 score and by averaging 12.15% on intrusion detection’s F1 score but also require much lesser storage resource requirement.","authors":["Yi Zeng","Huaxi Gu","Wei Wenting","Yantao Guo"],"meta":["January 2019IEEE Access PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2908225"],"references":["327921741_DataNet_Deep_Learning_based_Encrypted_Network_Traffic_Classification_in_SDN_Home_Gateway","325577753_Anomaly-Based_Intrusion_Detection_Using_Extreme_Learning_Machine_and_Aggregation_of_Network_Traffic_Statistics_in_Probability_Space","319054632_End-to-end_encrypted_traffic_classification_with_one-dimensional_convolution_neural_networks","291697471_Characterization_of_Encrypted_and_VPN_Traffic_Using_Time-Related_Features","335499264_DeepVCM_A_Deep_Learning_Based_Intrusion_Detection_Method_in_VANET","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","304326248_An_Analysis_of_Recurrent_Neural_Networks_for_Botnet_Behavior_Detection","269935079_Adam_A_Method_for_Stochastic_Optimization","267960550_ImageNet_Classification_with_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","257006500_Toward_developing_a_systematic_approach_to_generate_benchmark_datasets_for_intrusion_detection"]}
