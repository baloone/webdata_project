{"id":"307434764_Asynchronous_Simulation_of_Boolean_Networks_by_Monotone_Boolean_Networks","abstract":"We prove that the fully asynchronous dynamics of a Boolean network \\(f:\\{0,1\\}^n\\rightarrow \\{0,1\\}^n\\) without negative loop can be simulated, in a very specific way, by a monotone Boolean network with 2n components. We then use this result to prove that, for every even n, there exists a monotone Boolean network \\(f:\\{0,1\\}^n\\rightarrow \\{0,1\\}^n\\), an initial configuration x and a fixed point y of f such that: (i) y can be reached from x with a fully asynchronous updating strategy, and (ii) all such strategies contains at least \\(2^{\\frac{n}{2}}\\) updates. This contrasts with the following known property: if \\(f:\\{0,1\\}^n\\rightarrow \\{0,1\\}^n\\) is monotone, then, for every initial configuration x, there exists a fixed point y such that y can be reached from x with a fully asynchronous strategy that contains at most n updates.","authors":["Tarek Melliti","Damien Regnault","Adrien Richard","Sylvain Sen√©"],"meta":["September 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-44365-2_18","Conference: International Conference on Cellular Automata","Project: Discrete automata networks modeling and robustness studies"],"references":["272083794_Quantitative_and_logic_modelling_of_molecular_and_gene_networks","269721988_Reduction_and_Fixed_Points_of_Boolean_Networks_and_Linear_Network_Coding_Solvability","265966975_Fixed_Points_of_Boolean_Networks_Guessing_Graphs_and_Coding_Theory","265778262_On_the_Convergence_of_Boolean_Automata_Networks_without_Negative_Cycles","320181465_The_origins_of_order_self-organization_and_selection_in_evolution","303125726_A_logical_calculus_of_the_ideas_immanent_in_nervous_activity","292215395_Neural_networks_and_physical_systems_with_emergent_collective_computational_abilities","288233308_Boolean_formalisation_of_genetic_control_circuits","248603444_Metabolic_stability_and_epigenesis_in_randomly_constructed_genetic_J","246679114_Les_systemes_dynamiques_discrets"]}
