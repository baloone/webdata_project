In addition, the library is using the Web to further educate and assist its customers. SIBL provides Web access to its catalogs, a Web menu for the selection of electronic databases, Web guides for doing research in various subjects, and Web-accessible instructional materials. The library is also planning Web-based tutorials for its site which will reach a new, remote audience. Remote access to learning opportunities will enhance and extend traditional library services.","authors":["Ann Thornton"],"meta":["December 1998Journal of Business & Finance Librarianship 4(1):35-44","DOI:10.1300/J109v04n01_04"],"references":["272292366_Teaching_the_New_Library_a_how-to-do-it_manual_for_planning_and_designing_instructional_programs","262335084_The_multiple_personalities_of_delivering_training_via_the_Web","238344066_The_Internet_As_a_Medium_for_Online_Instruction","234739447_Library_Guides_on_the_Web_Traditional_Tenets_and_Internal_Issues"]}
