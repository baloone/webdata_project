De Meyer and Marino [(2005) Continuous versus discrete market game, Cowles Foundation Discussion Paper 1535] and Domansky and Kreps [(2005) Repeated games with asymmetric information and random price fluctuations at finance markets, Proc. Appl. Ind. Math. 12(4), 950–952 (in Russian)] investigated a game (Formula presented.) modeling multistage bidding with asymmetrically informed agents and proved that for this game (Formula presented.) converges to a finite limit (Formula presented.), i.e., the error term is (Formula presented.). In this paper, we show that for this example (Formula presented.) converges to the limit exponentially fast. For this purpose we apply the optimal strategy (Formula presented.) of insider in the infinite-stage game obtained by Domansky [(2007) Repeated games with asymmetric information and random price fluctuations at finance markets, Int. J. Game Theor. 36(2), 241–257] to the (Formula presented.)-stage game and deduce that it is (Formula presented.)-optimal with (Formula presented.) exponentially small.","authors":["Marina Sandomirskaya"],"meta":["August 2016International Game Theory Review 19(01)","DOI:10.1142/S0219198916500171"],"references":["24058786_On_the_strategic_origin_of_Brownian_Motion_in_finance","247317536_Chapter_5_Repeated_games_of_incomplete_information_Zero-sum","225191079_Repeated_games_simulating_exchange_auction_and_recursive_sequences","46477957_Repeated_games_with_asymmetric_information_and_random_price_fluctuations_at_finance_markets_the_case_of_countable_state_space","24058943_Repeated_games_with_asymmetric_information_and_random_price_fluctuations_at_finance_markets","4765149_Repeated_Games_of_Incomplete_Information_Zero-Sum"]}
