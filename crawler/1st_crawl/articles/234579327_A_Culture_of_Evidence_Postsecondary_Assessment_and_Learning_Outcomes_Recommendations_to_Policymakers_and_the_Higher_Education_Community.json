Key to improving performance of our colleges and universities is measuring that performance. In this paper, the authors assert that to understand the value added to student inputs by the college experience, it is essential to address three measurements: student input measures, student output measures, and a measure of change between inputs and outputs. The paper also briefly reviews principles of fair and valid testing that pertain to the assessments being recommended. (Contains 11 endnotes, 1 table, and 2 figures.)","authors":["Carol A.
