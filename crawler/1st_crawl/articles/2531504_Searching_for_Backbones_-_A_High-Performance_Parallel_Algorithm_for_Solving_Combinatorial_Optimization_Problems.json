{"id":"2531504_Searching_for_Backbones_-_A_High-Performance_Parallel_Algorithm_for_Solving_Combinatorial_Optimization_Problems","abstract":"A highly efficient parallel algorithm called Searching for Backbones (SfB) is pro- posed: based on the fact, that many parts of a good configuration for a given optimization problem are the same in all other good solutions, SfB reduces the complexity of this problem by finding these \"backbones\" and eliminating them in order to get even better solutions in a very short time. Applications and results are presented for the 25'aveling Salesman Problem and the Vehicle Routing Problem.","authors":["Johannes Schneider"],"meta":["May 2001Future Generation Computer Systems 19(1)","DOI:10.1016/S0167-739X(02)00106-1"],"references":["230636180_Determining_computational_complexity_from_characteristic_'phase_transitions'","220616869_An_Analysis_of_Several_Heuristics_for_the_Traveling_Salesman_Problem","220588728_Solution_of_large-scale_traveling_salesman_problems","6026283_Optimization_by_Simulated_Annealing","316322195_Monte_Carlo_Simulation_in_Statistical_Physics","315495143_Algorithmics_for_Hard_Problems","305395554_The_truck_despatching_problem","303170286_Computer_solutions_of_the_traveling_salesman_problem","295265592_Solution_of_large-scale_symmetric_travelling_salesman_problems","287661759_An_effective_heuristic_algorithm_for_the_traveling_salesman_problem","267475986_Polyedrische_Kombinatorik_und_Schnittebenenverfahren","265453391_The_traveling_salesman_problem_Bibliography","263975820_Optimization_of_production_planning_problems_-_A_case_study_for_assembly_lines","248040631_The_Traveling_Salesman_Problem_Computational_Solutions_for_TSP_Applications","247652030_Stochastic_versus_deterministic_update_in_simulated_annealing","228057735_Computers_And_Intractability_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness","224877317_Equation_of_State_Calculations_by_Fast_Computing_Machines","222750197_Searching_for_backbones_-_An_efficient_parallel_algorithm_for_the_traveling_salesman_problem","222469785_Threshold_Accepting_A_General_Purpose_Optimization_Algorithm_Appearing_Superior_to_Simulated_Annealing","220695890_Computers_and_Intracdtability_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness","201976952_Computer_Solution_of_the_Traveling_Salesman_Problem","201976935_An_Effective_Heuristic_Algorithm_for_the_TSP","200621952_The_Truck_Dispatching_Problem","200621942_Scheduling_of_Vehicles_From_a_Central_Depot_to_a_Number_of_Delivery_Points","200105001_Equation_of_State_by_Fast_Computing_Machines","50323967_On_the_Origin_of_Species_by_Means_of_Natural_Selection_or_the_Preservation_of_Favoured_Races_in_the_Struggle_for_Life","46953141_Monte_Carlo_Simulation_in_Statistical_Physics_An_Introduction","34203754_Effiziente_parallelisierbare_physikalische_Optimierungsverfahren","2267036_The_Landscape_of_the_Traveling_Salesman_Problem"]}
