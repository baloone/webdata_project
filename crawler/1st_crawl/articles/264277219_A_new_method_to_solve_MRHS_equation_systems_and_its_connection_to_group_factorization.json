{"id":"264277219_A_new_method_to_solve_MRHS_equation_systems_and_its_connection_to_group_factorization","abstract":"Multiple right-hand side (MRHS) equations over finite fields are a relatively\nnew tool useful for algebraic cryptanalysis. The main advantage is in an efficient\nrepresentation of the cryptographic primitives. The main methods to solve systems of MRHS\nequations are gluing, that relies on merging equations, and various versions of local reduction,\nthat relies on removing partial solutions.\nIn this paper we present a new algorithm to solve MRHS systems. The core of the algorithm is\na transformation of the problem of solving an MRHS equation system into a problem of group factorization.\nWe then provide two alternative algorithms to solve the transformed problem. One of these algorithms\nprovides a further transformation to the well-studied closest vector problem.\nA corollary of our research is that the solution of the group factorization problem\narising during the process of solving an MRHS equation system must be as difficult as the cryptanalysis\nof a corresponding block cipher described by this MRHS system.","authors":["Pavol Zajac"],"meta":["November 2013Journal of Mathematical Cryptology 7(4):367â€“381","DOI:10.1515/jmc-2013-5012"],"references":["264277388_A_Comparison_of_Local_Reduction_and_SAT-Solver_Based_Algebraic_Cryptanalysis_of_JH_And_Keccak","262215215_Solving_Trivium-based_Boolean_Equations_Using_the_Method_of_Syllogisms","257619123_Local_reduction_and_the_algebraic_cryptanalysis_of_the_block_cipher_gost","247461305_Secret-and_Public-key_Cryptosystems_from_Group_Factorizations","232069650_Properties_of_Cryptosystem_PGM","228973367_On_the_security_of_a_realization_of_cryptosystem_MST3","228944307_Methods_to_solve_algebraic_equations_in_cryptanalysis","227058945_On_solving_sparse_algebraic_equations_over_finite_fields","267080271_Algebraic_Cryptanalysis_of_Present_Based_on_the_Method_of_Syllogisms","221274676_MRHS_Equation_Systems"]}
