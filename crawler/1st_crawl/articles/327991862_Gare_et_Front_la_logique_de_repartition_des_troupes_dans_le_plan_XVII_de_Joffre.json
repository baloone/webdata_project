Our problem is the following: how were the 21 army corps allocated in the 5 predefined areas of combat in view of the existing rail network? What was the logic behind the allocation of troops? Can we identify any rationality and optimization logic in the transport of troops? To answer these questions, we apply two approaches of operational research: that of the transportation problem for the search for a system optimum, and the nearest neighbour to simulate an equilibrium logic. We find that a nearest neighbour logic reproduces pretty well the choices of the French high command. This analysis also reveals some grey zones.","authors":["Jesus Gonzalez-Feliu","Nicolas Ovtracht","Antoine Parent"],"meta":["October 2018"],"references":["272480994_Multi-stage_LTL_transport_systems_in_supply_chain_management","349783245_Preoccupations_internationales_et_action_locale_1890-1914","293224616_The_Great_War_in_History_Debates_and_Controversies_1914_to_the_Present","288257936_La_classification_ascendante_hierarchique_ascendante_selon_la_methode_des_voisins_reciproques","281983295_Geographie_economique_des_morts_de_14-18_en_France","272433324_Du_plan_strategique_au_plan_de_transport_Deux_succes_de_logistique_pour_deux_strategies_en_echec_aout_1914-septembre_1939","269494074_Histoire_de_la_population_francaise","265622188_An_annotated_timeline_of_operations_research_An_informal_history","242499017_The_Distribution_of_a_Product_from_Several_Sources_to_Numerous_Localities","238689645_Complexity_and_approarirnation_combinatorial_optimization_problems_and_their_approxirnability_properties"]}
