{"id":"257246671_The_nucleolus_of_large_majority_games","abstract":"Members of a shareholder meeting or legislative committee have greater or\nsmaller voting power than meets the eye if the nucleolus of the induced\nmajority game differs from the voting weight distribution. We establish a new\nsufficient condition for the weight and power distributions to be equal; and we\ncharacterize the limit behavior of the nucleolus in case all relative weights\nbecome small.","authors":["Sascha Kurz","Stefan Napel","Andreas Nohn"],"meta":["September 2013SSRN Electronic Journal 123(2)","DOI:10.1016/j.econlet.2014.01.041","SourcearXiv"],"references":["317201758_On_the_Democratic_Weights_of_Nations","228345649_On_the_Nucleolus_as_a_Power_Index","247053161_On_Weights_of_Constant-Sum_Majority_Games","242930058_The_Nucleolus_of_a_Matrix_Game_and_Other_Nucleoli","239061811_The_Nucleolus_of_a_Characteristic_Function_Game","229817235_The_Allocation_of_Funds_in_Lobbying_and_Campaigning","229026838_Uniqueness_of_stationary_equilibrium_payoffs_in_coalitional_bargaining","228217374_Voting_Power_in_the_EU_Council_of_Ministers_and_Fair_Decision_Making_in_Distributive_Politics","222667314_LS_Penrose's_Limit_Theorem_Proof_of_Some_Special_Cases","222506669_Strategic_bargaining_surplus_sharing_problems_and_the_nucleolus"]}
