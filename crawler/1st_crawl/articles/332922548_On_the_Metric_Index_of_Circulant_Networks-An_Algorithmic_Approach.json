{"id":"332922548_On_the_Metric_Index_of_Circulant_Networks-An_Algorithmic_Approach","abstract":"A vertex v of a graph G uniquely determines(resolves) a pair (v1,v2) of vertices of G if the distance between v and v1 is different from the distance between v and v2. The metric index is a distance based topological index of a graph G, which is the least number of vertices in G chosen in such a way that each vertex of G can be determined uniquely by its distances to the chosen vertices. The metric index of a family of graphs is said to be constant if it does not increase with increase in the number of vertices of graphs in the family. Otherwise, it is said to be unbounded. In this paper, we develop an algorithm to construct larger order circulant network from the smallest order circulant network. Then, we consider two families of circulant networks: one in the context of constant metric index; and one in the perspective of unbounded metric index to counter the popular belief that the metric index of circulant networks will never depend upon the number of vertices.","authors":["Imran Khalid","Faisal Ali","Muhammad Salman"],"meta":["May 2019IEEE Access PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2914933"],"references":["330490436_Fractional_Metric_Dimension_of_Generalized_Jahangir_Graph","330373946_Fault-Tolerant_Resolvability_and_Extremal_Structures_of_Graphs","329330163_On_the_Metric_Dimension_of_Generalized_Petersen_Multigraphs","324431557_On_computation_of_some_distance-based_topological_indices_on_circulant_networks-II","312150547_On_computation_of_some_distance-based_topological_indices_of_circulant_networks","310606373_Some_Invariants_of_Circulant_Graphs","286126309_On_resolvability_in_double-step_circulant_graphs","324868811_K_Banhatti_and_K_hyper_Banhatti_indices_of_circulant_graphs","312628479_Circulants_and_their_connectivities","303151748_Leaves_of_trees"]}
