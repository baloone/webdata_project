{"id":"281653440_Encoding_structural_information_uniquely_with_polynomial-based_descriptors_by_employing_the_Randic_matrix","abstract":"In this paper we define novel graph measures based on the zeros of the characteristic polynomial by using the RandiÄ‡ matrix. We compute the novel graph descriptors on exhaustively generated graphs and trees and demonstrate that the measures encode their structural information uniquely. These results are compared with the same graph measures but based on the eigenvalues of the classical characteristic polynomial of a graph. Finally we interpret our findings that are evidenced by numerical results.","authors":["M. Dehmer","M. Moosbrugger","Y.
