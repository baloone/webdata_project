{"id":"239583443_Subexponential_randomized_Simplex_algorithm","abstract":"We describe a randomized variant of the simplex algorithm. The expected number of arithmetic operations required by our algorithm for every linear programming problem with d variables and n constraints is at most min{nC·√d/log d, n2C√n-d√log d}. (C is an absolute constant.)","authors":["Gil Kalai"],"meta":["January 1992"],"references":[]}
