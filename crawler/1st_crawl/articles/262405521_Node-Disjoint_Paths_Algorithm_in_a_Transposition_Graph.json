{"id":"262405521_Node-Disjoint_Paths_Algorithm_in_a_Transposition_Graph","abstract":"In this paper, we give an algorithm for the node-to-set disjoint paths problem in a transposition graph. The algorithm is of polynomial order of n for an n-transposition graph. It is based on recursion and divided into two cases according to the distribution of destination nodes. The maximum length of each path and the time complexity of the algorithm are estimated theoretically to be O(n7) and 3n - 5, respectively, and the average performance is evaluated based on computer experiments.
