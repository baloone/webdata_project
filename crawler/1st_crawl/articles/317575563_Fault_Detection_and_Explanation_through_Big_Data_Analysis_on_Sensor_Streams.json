{"id":"317575563_Fault_Detection_and_Explanation_through_Big_Data_Analysis_on_Sensor_Streams","abstract":"Fault prediction is an important topic for the industry as, by providing effective methods for predictive maintenance, allows companies to perform important time and cost savings. In this paper we describe an application developed to predict and explain door failures on metro trains. To this end, the aim was twofold: first, devising prediction techniques capable of early detecting door failures from diagnostic data; second, describing failures in terms of properties distinguishing them from normal behavior. Data pre-processing was a complex task aimed at overcoming a number of issues with the dataset, like size, sparsity, bias, burst effect and trust. Since failure premonitory signals did not share common patterns, but were only characterized as non-normal device signals, fault prediction was performed by using outlier detection. Fault explanation was finally achieved by exhibiting device features showing abnormal values. An experimental evaluation was performed to assess the quality of the proposed approach. Results show that high-degree outliers are effective indicators of incipient failures. Also, explanation in terms of abnormal feature values (responsible for outlierness) seems to be quite expressive.","authors":["Giuseppe Manco","Ettore Ritacco","Pasquale Rullo","Lorenzo Gallucci"],"meta":["June 2017Expert Systems with Applications 87","DOI:10.1016/j.eswa.2017.05.079","Project: Create new project \"COBALT\""],"references":["273167098_On_condition_based_maintenance_policy","266660340_Log-based_predictive_maintenance","262880066_Recent_advances_and_trends_in_predictive_manufacturing_systems_in_big_data_environment","239924984_Methods_for_Fault_Detection_Diagnostics_and_Prognostics_for_Building_Systems_-_A_Review_Part_I","238950058_Outlying_Property_Detection_with_Numerical_Attributes","221653185_Feature_bagging_for_outlier_detection","221345178_Feature_Selection_for_Unbalanced_Class_Distribution_and_Naive_Bayes","220565847_Anomaly_Detection_A_Survey","4207735_Bias_Analysis_in_Text_Classification_for_Highly_Skewed_Data","2649935_A_Neural_Network_Autoassociator_for_Induction_Motor_Failure_Prediction","334884353_Extreme_learning_machines_for_predicting_operation_disruption_events_in_railway_systems","318393770_R_A_Language_and_Environment_for_Statistical_Computing","304298217_An_IoT_Application_for_Fault_Diagnosis_and_Prediction","303171133_Intelligent_fault_diagnosis_and_prognosis_for_engineering_systems_Methods_and_case_studies","301759839_Rialto_A_Knowledge_Discovery_Suite_for_Data_Analysis","300008634_Failure_Prediction_-_An_Application_in_the_Railway_Industry","299969784_Efficient_Long-Term_Degradation_Profiling_in_Time_Series_for_Complex_Physical_Systems","283105915_Online_Frequent_Episode_Mining","273337225_Support_vector_machine_based_estimation_of_remaining_useful_life_current_research_status_and_future_trends","271556514_Explaining_Outliers_by_Subspace_Separability","225516809_Current_status_of_machine_prognostics_in_condition-based_maintenance_A_review","221995817_Maximum_Likelihood_from_Incomplete_Data_Via_EM_Algorithm","220519984_Term_selection_for_text_categorization_on_imbalanced_data","220220385_Anomaly_Detection_in_Monitoring_Sensor_Data_for_Preventive_Maintenance","220183069_Unsupervised_Learning_of_Finite_Mixture_Models"]}
