{"id":"262140972_Strong_convergence_and_stability_of_Kirk-multistep-type_iterative_schemes_for_contractive-type_operators","abstract":"In this paper, we introduce Kirk-multistep and Kirk-multistep-SP iterative schemes and\nprove their strong convergences and stabilities for contractive-type operators in\nnormed linear spaces. By taking numerical examples, we compare the convergence\nspeed of our schemes (Kirk-multistep-SP iterative schemes) with the others (Kirk-SP,\nKirk-Noor, Kirk-Ishikawa, Kirk-Mann and Kirk iterative schemes) for this class of\noperators. Our results generalize and extend most convergence and stability results in\nthe literature.","authors":["Hudson Akewe","Godwin Amechi Okeke","Adekunle F Olayiwola"],"meta":["January 2014Fixed Point Theory and Applications 2014(1):1-24","DOI:10.1186/1687-1812-2014-45"],"references":["266833357_On_the_stability_of_some_fixed_point_procedures","266222426_Stability_of_Hybrid_Fixed_Point_Iterative_Algorithms_of_Kirk-Noor_Type_in_Normed_Linear_Space_for_Self_and_Nonself_Operators","303495043_Fixed_point_by_a_new_iteration_method","284091802_Some_results_of_fixed_points","268994460_Fixed_point_theorem","268607514_Fixed-point_theorems","268247349_Iterative_Approximation_of_Fixed_Points","268246740_Short_proofs_of_stability_results_for_fixed_point_iteration_procedures_for_a_class_of_contractive-type_mappings","266992056_On_the_stability_results_for_Picard_and_Mann_iteration_procedures","266699950_Stability_results_for_Ishikawa_fixed_point_iteration_procedure"]}
