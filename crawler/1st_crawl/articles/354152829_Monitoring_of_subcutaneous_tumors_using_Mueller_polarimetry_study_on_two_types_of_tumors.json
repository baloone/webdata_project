{"id":"354152829_Monitoring_of_subcutaneous_tumors_using_Mueller_polarimetry_study_on_two_types_of_tumors","abstract":"A better understanding of tumor development is crucial for treating cancer. Polarimetric imaging is an interesting alternative for monitoring subcutaneous tumors as it is non-invasive. In this study, a Mueller spectro-polarimeter is used to monitor tumor development on mice injected with non-pigmented breast cancer cells or with pigmented murine melanoma cells. Three stages of non-pigmented tumor development are revealed with three polarimetric parameters. These stages also appear for pigmented tumors, although less clearly. A halo of high depolarization surrounding the non-pigmented tumor in the first stage allows the outlining of the tumor. Considering polarimetric parameters, a biological interpretation is proposed.","authors":["Bris√©is Varin","Jean Rehbinder","Jean Dellinger","Christian Heinrich"],"meta":["August 2021Biomedical Optics Express 12(10)","DOI:10.1364/BOE.433754"],"references":["343809114_Visualization_of_White_Matter_Fiber_Tracts_of_Brain_Tissue_Sections_With_Wide-Field_Imaging_Mueller_Polarimetry","334639827_Tumor_growth_monitoring_using_polarized_light","262055817_Human_Tumor_Xenograft_Models_for_Preclinical_Assessment_of_Anticancer_Drug_Development","240309021_Polarimetric_imaging_of_uterine_cervix_A_case_study","342861024_Revisiting_the_generalized_polar_decomposition_ofMueller_matrices","339423848_Ultra-stable_spectropolarimeter_for_dermatology","322283149_Rational_Design_of_Mouse_Models_for_Cancer_Research","283193950_Preclinical_Mouse_Cancer_Models_A_Maze_of_Opportunities_and_Challenges","275357031_Investigation_on_the_potential_of_Mueller_matrix_imaging_for_digital_staining","243577219_Interpretation_of_Mueller_matrices_based_on_polar_decomposition"]}
