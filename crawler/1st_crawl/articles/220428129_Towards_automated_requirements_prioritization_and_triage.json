{"id":"220428129_Towards_automated_requirements_prioritization_and_triage","abstract":"Time-to-market deadlines and budgetary restrictions require stakeholders to carefully prioritize requirements and determine\nwhich ones to implement in a given product release. Unfortunately, existing prioritization techniques do not provide sufficient\nautomation for large projects with hundreds of stakeholders and thousands of potentially conflicting requests and requirements.\nThis paper therefore describes a new approach for automating a significant part of the prioritization process. The proposed\nmethod utilizes data-mining and machine learning techniques to prioritize requirements according to stakeholders’ interests,\nbusiness goals, and cross-cutting concerns such as security or performance requirements. The effectiveness of the approach\nis illustrated and evaluated through two case studies based on the requirements of the Ice Breaker System, and also on a set\nof stakeholders’ raw feature requests mined from the discussion forum of an open source product named SugarCRM.","authors":["Chuan Duan","Paula Laurent","Jane Cleland-Huang","Charles Kwiatkowski"],"meta":["June 2009Requirements Engineering 14(2):73-89","DOI:10.1007/s00766-009-0079-7","SourceDBLP"],"references":["221615398_A_consensus_based_approach_to_constrained_clustering_of_software_requirements","221222666_The_Detection_and_Classification_of_Non-Functional_Requirements_with_Application_to_Early_Aspects","220884032_Clustering_support_for_automated_tracing","220225648_Concepts_and_Effectiveness_of_the_Cover-Coefficient-Based_Clustering_Methodology_for_Text_Databases","4292137_Towards_Automated_Requirements_Triage","4200529_Goal-Centric_traceability_for_managing_non-functional_requirements","4186942_Utilizing_supporting_evidence_to_improve_dynamic_requirements_traceability","3248118_The_incremental_funding_method_Data-driven_software_development","3247305_A_Cost-Value_Approach_for_Prioritizing_Requirements","2961853_Best_Practices_for_Automated_Traceability","2633937_ScatterGather_A_Cluster-based_Approach_to_Browsing_Large_Document_Collections","2628533_A_Comparison_of_Document_Clustering_Techniques","2511281_Fast_and_Intuitive_Clustering_of_Web_Documents","2489831_Finding_Topics_in_Collections_of_Documents_A_Shared_Nearest_Neighbor_Approach","2304292_AbstFinder_A_Prototype_Natural_Language_Text_Abstraction_Finder_for_Use_in_Requirements_Elicitation","312471087_The_detection_and_classification_of_non-functional_requirements_with_application_to_early_aspects","279591211_Who_killed_the_virtual_case_file","254582836_Clustering_and_its_Application_in_Requirements_Engineering","248130590_Towards_a_strategy_for_software_requirements_selection","242509165_Information_retrieval_systems_Theory_and_implementation","242350998_Extreme_Programming_Explained_Embrace_Change","240626894_The_Incremental_Funding_Method_-_A_Data_Driven_Approach_to_Software_Development","239545599_A_system_for_software_engineering","239540150_Mastering_the_Requirements_Process","234816705_Managing_Software_Requirements_A_Use_Case_Approach","234802458_Software_Requirements","234797994_Design_and_implementation_of_a_requirements_clustering_analyzer_for_software_system_decomposition","220996068_Toward_software_requirements_modularization_using_hierarchical_clustering_techniques","220695912_Algorithms_for_Clustering_Data","220093396_Value-Oriented_Requirements_Prioritization_in_a_Small_Development_Organization","4325577_Visual_Support_In_Automated_Tracing","4186951_An_approach_to_constructing_feature_models_based_on_requirements_clustering","3854675_Prioritising_scenario_evolution","3625058_User-centered_system_decomposition_Z-based_requirements_clustering","3187111_Theory-W_Software_Project_Management_Principles_and_Examples","3000949_Who_killed_the_virtual_case_file_case_management_software","2955863_The_art_of_requirements_triage","2955399_Weaving_Together_Requirements_and_Architectures","2801245_Concept_Decompositions_for_Large_Sparse_Text_Data_Using_Clustering"]}
