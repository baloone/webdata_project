{"id":"327838191_An_efficient_approach_for_test_suite_reduction_using_K-means_clustering","abstract":"Software testing is the primary approach that is used to test and evaluate software under development. The main goal of testing is to find defects before customers find them out. It is very costly. Therefore, reducing the cost of the test is a big challenge. This paper aims at reducing the cost of the test by eliminating the redundant test cases. Our methodology begins with generating the test cases randomly. The Procedural Language/Structured Query Language (PL/SQL) tool is used to generate test cases from the payroll system database functions. The SPSS software package is used to apply the K-means Clustering algorithm to reduce the test cases. The results reveal that the proposed approach significantly reduces the number of test cases from 776 to 240 while keeping the same coverage.","authors":["Mohammed Akour","I. Al Jarrah","A.A.
