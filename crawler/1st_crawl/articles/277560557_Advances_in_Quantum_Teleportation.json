{"id":"277560557_Advances_in_Quantum_Teleportation","abstract":"Quantum teleportation is one of the most important protocols in quantum\ninformation. By exploiting the physical resource of entanglement, quantum\nteleportation serves as a key primitive in a variety of quantum information\ntasks and represents an important building block for quantum technologies, with\na pivotal role in the continuing progress of quantum communication, quantum\ncomputing and quantum networks. Here we review the basic theoretical ideas\nbehind quantum teleportation and its variant protocols. We focus on the main\nexperiments, together with the technical advantages and disadvantages\nassociated with the use of the various technologies, from photonic qubits and\noptical modes to atomic ensembles, trapped atoms, and solid-state systems.\nAnalysing the current state-of-the-art, we finish by discussing open issues,\nchallenges and potential future implementations.","authors":["Stefano Pirandola","Jens Eisert","Christian Weedbrook","Akira Furusawa"],"meta":["May 2015Nature Photonics 9(10)","DOI:10.1038/nphoton.2015.154","SourcearXiv"],"references":["281311993_Quantum_memory_with_near-millisecond_coherence_in_circuit_QED","316798812_Quantum_Optics","313996642_Quantum_Teleportation_and_Entanglement_A_Hybrid_Approach_to_Optical_Quantum_Information_Processing","310750264_Quantum_teleportation_on_a_photonic_chip","308882995_Quantum_Teleportation_of_a_Polarization_State_with_a_Complete_Bell_State_Measurement","304350371_Quantum_Communication_Complexity_Advantage_Implies_Violation_of_a_Bell_Inequality","302556848_Quantum_Teleportation_with_Complete_Bell_State_Measurement","291249639_Quantum_teleoperation_of_light_beams","289954717_Quantum_cloning_and_teleportation_criteria_for_continuous_quantum_variables","285333729_Introduction_to_Quantum_Information_Processing"]}
