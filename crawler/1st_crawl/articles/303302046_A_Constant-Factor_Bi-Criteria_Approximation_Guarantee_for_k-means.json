{"id":"303302046_A_Constant-Factor_Bi-Criteria_Approximation_Guarantee_for_k-means","abstract":"This paper studies the $k$-means++ algorithm for clustering as well as the class of $D^\\ell$ sampling algorithms to which $k$-means++ belongs. It is shown that for any constant factor $\\beta > 1$, selecting $\\beta k$ cluster centers by $D^\\ell$ sampling yields a constant-factor approximation to the optimal clustering with $k$ centers, in expectation and without conditions on the dataset. This result extends the previously known $O(\\log k)$ guarantee for the case $\\beta = 1$ to the constant-factor bi-criteria regime. It also improves upon an existing constant-factor bi-criteria result that holds only with constant probability.","authors":["Dennis Wei"],"meta":["May 2016"],"references":["312971435_Local_search_heuristics_for_k-median_and_facility_location_problems","234804011_Applications_of_weighted_Voronoi_diagrams_and_randomization_to_variance-based-clustering","234054500_Optimal_Time_Bounds_for_Approximate_Clustering","309715704_Least_squares_quantization_in_PCM","305092466_The_effectiveness_of_lloyd-type_methods_for_the_k-means_problem","303151754_Least_squares_quantization","301307428_Tight_Lower_Bound_Instances_for_k-means_in_Two_Dimensions","280104557_A_bi-criteria_approximation_algorithm_for_k_Means","272194462_The_Hardness_of_Approximation_of_Euclidean_k-means","259717954_A_Tight_Lower_Bound_Instance_for_k-means_in_Constant_Dimension"]}
