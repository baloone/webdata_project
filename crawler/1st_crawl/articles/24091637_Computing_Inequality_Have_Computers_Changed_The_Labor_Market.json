{"id":"24091637_Computing_Inequality_Have_Computers_Changed_The_Labor_Market","abstract":"This paper examines the effect of skill-biased technological change as measured by computerization on the recent widening\nof U. S. educational wage differentials. An analysis of aggregate changes in the relative supplies and wages of workers by\neducation from 1940 to 1996 indicates strong and persistent growth in relative demand favoring college graduates. Rapid skill\nupgrading within detailed industries accounts for most of the growth in the relative demand for college workers, particularly\nsince 1970. Analyses of four data sets indicate that the rate of skill upgrading has been greater in more computer-intensive\nindustries.","authors":["David Autor","Alan B. Krueger","Lawrence F.
