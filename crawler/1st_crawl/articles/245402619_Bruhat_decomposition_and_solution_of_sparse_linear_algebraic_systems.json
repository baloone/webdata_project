{"id":"245402619_Bruhat_decomposition_and_solution_of_sparse_linear_algebraic_systems","abstract":"Gauss-type decompositions commonly used for solving linear algebraic systems of equations with sparse coefficient matrices do not make it possible to take into consideration more subtle matrix characteristics than properties which can be described in terms of the non-zero entry locations. The Bruhat decomposition known from the theory of linear algebraic groups is suggested as an alternative to Gauss-type decompositions. Unlike Gauss-type decompositions, this decomposition exists for any non-singular square matrix. The Bruhat decomposition makes it possible to associate with a non-singular matrix A its Bruhat permutation nAbearing important information on the matrix. The ability of the Bruhat decomposition to reveal some matrix properties neglected by Gauss-type decompositions allows the formulation of a global analytical criterion for optimizing sparsity patterns of triangular factors of the Bruhat decomposition, the presentation of methods for constructing multiplicative and additive suggestion of inverse matrices and the introducing of some canonical forms to which it is expedient to transform matrices before performing their Bruhat decomposition.","authors":["L.
