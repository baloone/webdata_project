{"id":"339516973_World_Health_Organization_declares_Global_Emergency_A_review_of_the_2019_Novel_Coronavirus_COVID-19","abstract":"An unprecedented outbreak of pneumonia of unknown aetiology in Wuhan City, Hubei province in China emerged in December of 2019. A novel coronavirus was identified as the causative agent and was subsequently termed COVID-19 by the World Health Organization (WHO). Considered a relative of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), COVID-19 is a betacoronavirus that affects the lower respiratory tract and manifests as pneumonia in humans. Despite rigorous global containment and quarantine efforts, the incidence of COVID-19 continues to rise, with 50,580 laboratory-confirmed cases and 1,526 deaths worldwide. In response to this global outbreak, we summarise the current state of knowledge surrounding COVID-19.","authors":["Catrin Sohrabi","Zaid Alsafi","Niamh Oâ€™Neill","Mehdi Khan"],"meta":["February 2020International Journal of Surgery (London, England) 76","DOI:10.1016/j.ijsu.2020.02.034"],"references":["339210982_Clinical_characteristics_of_novel_coronavirus_cases_in_tertiary_hospitals_in_Hubei_Province","339112553_Clinical_Characteristics_of_138_Hospitalized_Patients_With_2019_Novel_Coronavirus-Infected_Pneumonia_in_Wuhan_China","338949183_Transmission_of_2019-nCoV_Infection_from_an_Asymptomatic_Contact_in_Germany","338904336_Early_Transmission_Dynamics_in_Wuhan_China_of_Novel_Coronavirus-Infected_Pneumonia","338816497_A_Novel_Coronavirus_from_Patients_with_Pneumonia_in_China_2019","338806634_Clinical_features_of_patients_infected_with_2019_novel_coronavirus_in_Wuhan_China","338649099_Outbreak_of_Pneumonia_of_Unknown_Etiology_in_Wuhan_China_the_Mystery_and_the_Miracle","323494866_Middle_East_respiratory_syndrome_what_we_learned_from_the_2015_outbreak_in_the_Republic_of_Korea","315703719_Current_challenges_in_the_management_of_sepsis_in_ICUs_in_resource-poor_settings_and_suggestions_for_the_future","312544971_Surviving_Sepsis_Campaign_International_Guidelines_for_Management_of_Sepsis_and_Septic_Shock_2016","312503654_Surviving_Sepsis_Campaign_International_Guidelines_for_Management_of_Sepsis_and_Septic_Shock","272836086_Coronaviruses_An_Overview_of_Their_Replication_and_Pathogenesis","47396516_Circulating_high_sensitivity_troponin_T_in_severe_sepsis_and_septic_shock_Distribution_associated_factors_and_relation_to_outcome","7259304_Role_of_lopinavirritonavir_in_the_treatment_of_SARS_initial_virological_and_clinical_findings","338933612_Genomic_characterisation_and_epidemiology_of_2019_novel_coronavirus_implications_for_virus_origins_and_receptor_binding","338931536_Epidemiological_and_clinical_characteristics_of_99_cases_of_2019_novel_coronavirus_pneumonia_in_Wuhan_China_a_descriptive_study","338930375_The_Novel_Coronavirus_Originating_in_Wuhan_China_Challenges_for_Global_Health_Governance","338900267_Updated_understanding_of_the_outbreak_of_2019_novel_coronavirus_2019-nCoV_in_Wuhan_China","5333573_SARS_Clinical_features_and_diagnosis"]}
