At the same time, information technology and communication (ICT) appear in speeches and multiple projects as sources of new opportunities for the individual. For new uses and modes of\nsocialization and skills they induce, they transform the professional and domestic activity organization in different dimensions, as well as the human capital needs of the labor market. The objectives raised then are research to what extent the use of ICT could have a positive impact on the socio-professional integration of young Lebanese. To answer this question, this thesis provides a survey methodology and analysis based on the paradigm of economies of scale issued from the work of Boltanski, Th√©venot, and Chiapello. It analyzes the discourses of actors concerned by the issue of professional and social integration in our specific context, and technology practices of the considered public.","authors":["Rawad Chaker"],"meta":["February 2011","Thesis for: PhDAdvisor: Alain Jaillet","Project: ICT use, adult learning and employability"],"references":[]}
