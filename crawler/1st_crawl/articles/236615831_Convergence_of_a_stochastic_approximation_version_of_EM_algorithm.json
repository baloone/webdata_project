{"id":"236615831_Convergence_of_a_stochastic_approximation_version_of_EM_algorithm","abstract":"The expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is a powerful\ncomputational technique for locating maxima of functions. It is widely used in\nstatistics for maximum likelihood or maximum a posteriori estimation in\nincomplete data models. In certain situations, however, this method is not\napplicable because the expectation step cannot be performed in closed form. To\ndeal with these problems, a novel method is introduced, the stochastic\napproximation EM (SAEM), which replaces the expectation step of the EM\nalgorithm by one iteration of a stochastic approximation procedure. The\nconvergence of the SAEM algorithm is established under conditions that are\napplicable to many practical situations. Moreover, it is proved that, under\nmild additional conditions, the attractive stationary points of the SAEM\nalgorithm correspond to the local maxima of the function presented to support\nour findings.","authors":["B.
