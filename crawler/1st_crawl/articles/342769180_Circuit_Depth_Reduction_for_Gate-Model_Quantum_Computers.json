{"id":"342769180_Circuit_Depth_Reduction_for_Gate-Model_Quantum_Computers","abstract":"Quantum computers utilize the fundamentals of quantum mechanics to solve computational problems more efficiently than traditional computers. Gate-model quantum computers are fundamental to implement near-term quantum computer architectures and quantum devices. Here, a quantum algorithm is defined for the circuit depth reduction of gate-model quantum computers. The proposed solution evaluates the reduced time complexity equivalent of a reference quantum circuit. We prove the complexity of the quantum algorithm and the achievable reduction in circuit depth. The method provides a tractable solution to reduce the time complexity and physical layer costs of quantum computers.","authors":["Laszlo Gyongyosi","Sandor Imre"],"meta":["July 2020Scientific Reports 10(1):11229","DOI:10.1038/s41598-020-67014-5"],"references":["347177588_Efficient_Routing_for_Quantum_Key_Distribution_Networks","341366393_Towards_storage_rings_as_quantum_computers","341349587_Towards_a_Distributed_Quantum_Computing_Ecosystem","339857182_Quantum_State_Optimization_and_Computational_Pathway_Evaluation_for_Gate-Model_Quantum_Computers","339392205_Delocalized_information_in_quantum_networks","338920377_Observable_quantum_entanglement_due_to_gravity","341635351_Approximate_approximation_on_a_quantum_annealer","339502846_Decision_Forests_A_Unified_Framework_for_Classification_Regression_Density_Estimation_Manifold_Learning_and_Semi-Supervised_Learning","338783001_Entanglement_Verification_in_Quantum_Networks_With_Tampered_Nodes","338440489_Multi-Tenant_Provisioning_for_Quantum_Key_Distribution_Networks_With_Heuristics_and_Reinforcement_Learning_A_Comparative_Study"]}
