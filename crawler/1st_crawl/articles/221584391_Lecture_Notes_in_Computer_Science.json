{"id":"221584391_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","abstract":"We study accuracy guaranteed solutions of geometric problems denned on convex region under an assumption that input points are known only up to a limited accuracy, that is, each input point is given by a convex region that represents the possible locations of the point. We show how to compute tight error bounds for basic problems such as convex hull, Minkowski sum of convex polygons, diameter of points, and so on. To compute tight error bound from imprecise coordinates, we represent a convex region by a set of half-planes whose intersection gives the region. Error bounds are computed by applying rotating caliper paradigm to this representation.","authors":["Takayuki Nagai","Nobuki Tokura"],"meta":["January 2000","DOI:10.1007/3-540-47738-1_24","SourceDBLP","Conference: Discrete and Computational Geometry, Japanese Conference, JCDCG 2000, Tokyo, Japan, November, 22-25, 2000, Revised Papers"],"references":["234776309_Epsilon_geometry_Building_robust_algorithms_from_imprecise_computations","226848441_Constructing_strongly_convex_approximate_hulls_with_inaccurate_primitives","222456807_Efficient_Algorithms_for_Common_Transversals","222380485_A_convex_hull_algorithm_for_discs_and_applications","221584380_Convex_Hull_Problem_with_Imprecise_Input","220669976_A_convex_hull_algorithm_for_points_with_approximately_known_positions","220669823_Computing_Visibility_Information_in_an_Inaccurate_Simple_Polygon","220463618_Convex_Hull_Problem_with_Imprecise_Input_and_Its_Solution","220113744_Finding_the_Upper_Envelope_of_n_Line_Segments_in_On_log_n_Time","47389428_Constructing_Levels_in_Arrangements_and_Higher_Order_Voronoi_Diagrams","2798925_Computational_Geometry_and_Facility_Location","2578952_Solving_Geometric_Problems_with_the_Rotating_Calipers"]}
