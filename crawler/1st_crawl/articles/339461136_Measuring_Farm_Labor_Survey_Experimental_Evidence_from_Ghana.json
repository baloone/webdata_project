{"id":"339461136_Measuring_Farm_Labor_Survey_Experimental_Evidence_from_Ghana","abstract":"This study examines recall bias in farm labor through a randomized survey experiment in Ghana, comparing farm labor estimates from a recall survey at the end of the season with data collected weekly throughout the season. Recall households report 10 percent more farm labor per person per plot â€“ which can be explained by the fact that recall households list fewer marginal plots and workers. Because of this listing bias, the recall method underestimates farm labor per plot and per household, and overestimates farm labor productivity. Consistent with the notion that reporting bias is linked to the cognitive burden of reporting on past events, we find no recall bias among more educated households, who list plots more accurately.","authors":["Isis Gaddis","Gbemisola Oseni","Amparo Palacios Lopez","Janneke Pieters"],"meta":["February 2020The World Bank Economic Review 35(1)","DOI:10.1093/wber/lhaa012"],"references":["318679116_Survey_data_of_intra-household_decision_making_and_smallholder_agricultural_production_in_Northern_Uganda_and_Southern_Tanzania","309436501_Labor_productivity_and_employment_gaps_in_Sub-Saharan_Africa","305363006_Investigating_the_Gender_Gap_in_Agricultural_Productivity_Evidence_from_Uganda","276099312_Inefficiency_of_Male_and_Female_Labor_Supply_in_Agricultural_Households_Evidence_from_Uganda","260526881_Forgetting_to_remember_or_remembering_to_forget_A_study_of_the_recall_period_length_in_health_care_survey_questions","260296731_Can_Agricultural_Input_Subsidies_Reduce_the_Gender_Gap_in_Modern_Maize_Adoption_Evidence_from_Malawi","254416399_Estimating_yield_of_food_crops_grown_by_smallholder_farmers_A_review_in_the_Uganda_context","228313253_Reliability_of_Recall_in_Agricultural_Data","46552563_The_Quality_of_Retrospective_Data_An_Examination_of_Long-Term_Recall_in_a_Developing_Country","24120407_The_Quality_of_Retrospective_Reports_in_the_Malaysian_Family_Life_Survey","13505707_Looking_Back_at_Anger_Reference_Periods_Change_the_Interpretation_of_Emotion_Frequency_Questions","13457854_Strategies_for_Estimating_Behavioural_Frequency_in_Survey_Interviews","334847148_Partnerships_and_production_Agriculture_and_polygyny_in_Tanzanian_households","331084127_Asymmetric_non-separation_and_rural_Labor_Markets","330268497_Heterogeneity_Measurement_Error_and_Misallocation_Evidence_from_African_Agriculture","320579781_Not_your_average_job_Measuring_farm_labor_in_Tanzania","317996122_Returns_to_Farm_Child_Labor_in_Tanzania","314524523_Land_Misallocation_and_Productivity","308670002_Farms_Families_and_Markets_New_Evidence_on_Completeness_of_Markets_in_Agricultural_Settings","308544010_Field_Experiments_in_Developing_Country_Agriculture","282990756_The_Gender_Gap_in_Agricultural_Productivity_The_Role_of_Market_Imperfections","282955652_How_Does_the_Choice_of_the_Gender_Indicator_Affect_the_Analysis_of_Gender_Differences_in_Agricultural_Productivity_Evidence_from_Uganda","275442863_Asking_Questions_About_Behavior_Cognition_Communication_and_Questionnaire_Construction","275368043_Decomposition_of_gender_differentials_in_agricultural_productivity_in_Ethiopia","274322099_Explaining_gender_differentials_in_agricultural_production_in_Nigeria","269871042_The_Agricultural_Productivity_Gap","262606607_Agricultural_Productivity_Differences_across_Countries","256051798_Caught_in_a_Productivity_Trap_A_Distributional_Perspective_on_Gender_Differences_in_Malawian_Agriculture","242776508_Gender_Time_Use_and_Poverty_in_Sub-Saharan_Africa","240248062_The_Effects_of_Accessibility_of_Information_in_Memory_on_Judgments_of_Behavioral_Frequencies","236856470_Making_sense_of_standardized_survey_questions_The_influence_of_reference_periods_and_their_repetition","227414103_The_Evolving_Role_of_Agriculture_in_Poverty_Reduction_--_An_Empirical_Perspective","46552502_Retrospective_Versus_Panel_Data_in_Analyzing_Life-Cycle_Events","45272841_Low_Numeracy_Predicts_Reduced_Accuracy_of_Retrospective_Reports_of_Frequency_of_Sexual_Behavior"]}
