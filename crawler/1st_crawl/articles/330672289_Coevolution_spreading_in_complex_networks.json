{"id":"330672289_Coevolution_spreading_in_complex_networks","abstract":"The propagations of diseases, behaviors and information in real systems are rarely independent to each other, yet they are coevolving with strong interactions. To uncover the dynamical mechanisms, spatio-temporal evolving patterns and critical phenomena of networked coevolution spreading is extremely important, which provides some theoretical foundations for us to control epidemic spreading, to predict collective behaviors in social systems, and so on. The coevolution spreading dynamics in complex networks has thus attracted much attentions in many disciplines. In this review, we introduce recent progresses of coevolution spreading dynamics, emphasizing the contributions from the perspective of statistical mechanics and network science. The theoretical methods, critical phenomena, phase transitions, interacting mechanisms and effects of network topology for four representative types of coevolution spreading mechanisms, including the coevolu-tion of biology contagions, social contagions, epidemic-awareness and epidemic-resources, are presented detailedly, and the challenges in this field as well as open issues for future studies are also discussed.","authors":["Wei Wang","Quan-Hui Liu","Junhao Liang","Yanqing Hu"],"meta":["January 2019Physics Reports 820","DOI:10.1016/j.physrep.2019.07.001"],"references":["333851623_Reactive_school_closure_weakens_the_network_of_social_interactions_and_reduces_the_spread_of_influenza","331109378_Persistent_spatial_patterns_of_interacting_contagions","329384904_Epidemic_spreading_on_time-varying_multiplex_networks","329113150_Measurability_of_the_epidemic_reproduction_number_in_data-driven_contact_networks","327215339_Co-diffusion_of_social_contagions","334550479_Exact_solution_of_generalized_cooperative_susceptible-infected-removed_SIR_dynamics","330018926_How_Behavior_Spreads_The_Science_of_Complex_Contagions","329434177_Controlling_epidemic_outbreak_based_on_local_dynamic_infectiousness_on_complex_networks","329229639_Relevance_of_backtracking_paths_in_recurrent-state_epidemic_spreading_on_networks","329227276_Critical_phenomena_of_information_spreading_dynamics_on_networks_with_cliques","327191015_Double_transition_of_information_spreading_in_a_two-layered_network","325942647_The_impact_of_individual_heterogeneity_on_the_coupled_awareness-epidemic_dynamics_in_multiplex_networks","327029920_Can_Network_Theory-Based_Targeting_Increase_Technology_Adoption","326308665_Propagation_of_interacting_diseases_on_multilayer_networks","326165091_Local_structure_can_identify_and_quantify_influential_global_spreaders_in_large_scale_social_networks"]}
