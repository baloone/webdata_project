{"id":"333404760_An_Application_of_Discriminant_Analysis_to_the_Classification_of_Students_on_the_Basis_of_their_Academic_Performances","abstract":"In this paper, a discriminant analysis was carried out and the rule for discrimination was obtained. The analysis yielded a linear discriminant model used as a function with which some students were reclassified based on their academic performances. The rule discriminated 4 students from Statistics department to Computer Science department, and 5 students from Computer Science department to Statistics department based on their scores in four departmental courses they did together.","authors":["Joseph O Onu","Onyedikachi John"],"meta":["September 2016"],"references":["287415016_Application_of_discriminant_analysis_to_predict_the_class_f_degree_for_graduating_students_in_a_university_system","273546471_Multivariate_Statistical_Methods","324354916_Applied_Multivariate_Statistical_Analysis","284529450_Discriminant_Analysis","284429475_On_a_statistical_problem_arising_in_the_classification_of_an_individual_into_one_of_two_groups","254286896_Regularized_Discriminant_Analysis","24061196_Classification_by_Multivariate_Analysis"]}
