{"id":"257592413_A_High-Order_Moving_Mesh_Kinetic_Scheme_Based_on_WENO_Reconstruction_for_Compressible_Flows_on_Unstructured_Meshes","abstract":"In this paper, we present a high-order moving mesh (HMM) kinetic scheme for compressible flow computations on unstructured meshes. To construct the scheme, we employ the frame of the remapping-free ALE-type kinetic method (Ni et al. in J Comput Phys 228:3154–3171, 2009) to get the discretization of compressible system. For the space accuracy, we use the weighted essential non-oscillatory reconstruction on the adaptive moving mesh from Tang and Tang (SIAM J Numer Anal 41:487–515 2003) to achieve time accuracy,we make use of the kinetic flux which includes time accurate integral, and thus obtain a HMM scheme. A number of numerical examples are given, especially an isentropic vortex problem to show the convergence order of the scheme. Numerical results demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the scheme.","authors":["Xihua Xu","Guoxi Ni","Song Jiang"],"meta":["November 2013Journal of Scientific Computing 57(2)","DOI:10.1007/s10915-013-9705-0"],"references":["267725171_Moving_Finite_Element_Simulations_for_Reaction-Diffusion_Systems","260340779_Universal_High_Order_Subroutine_with_New_Shock_Detector_for_Shock_Boundary_Layer_Interaction","228618981_An_Optimization-Based_Rezoning_for_ALE_Methods","228613125_A_general_moving_mesh_framework_in_3D_and_its_application_for_simulating_the_mixture_of_multi-phase_flows","222526139_On_the_Construction_Comparison_and_Local_Characteristic_Decomposition_for_High-Order_Central_WENO_Schemes","222459521_The_numerical_simulation_of_two-dimensional_fluid_flow_with_strong_shocks","220411375_Runge--Kutta_Discontinuous_Galerkin_Method_Using_WENO_Limiters","220395977_Second-Order_Accurate_Godunov_Scheme_for_Multicomponent_Flows_on_Moving_Triangular_Meshes","220179239_Adaptive_Mesh_Methods_for_One-_and_Two-Dimensional_Hyperbolic_Conservation_Laws","23886375_Discontinuous_Spectral_Difference_Method_for_Conservation_Laws_on_Unstructured_Grids","4707074_Discontinuous_Spectral_Difference_Method_for_Conservation_Laws_on_Unstructured_Grids","285599538_Fluid_Mechanics","278864657_An_arbitrary_Lagrangian-Eulerian_computing_method_for_all_flow_speeds_Reprinted_from_the_Journal_of_Computational_Physics_vol_14_pg_227-253_1974","271951506_A_high-order_multidimensional_gas-kinetic_scheme_for_hydrodynamic_equations","260798625_A_moving_mesh_method_for_the_Euler_flow_calculations_using_a_directional_monitor_function","258654422_A_moving_mesh_BGK_scheme_for_multi-material_flows","253902699_Erratum_Volume_149_Number_2_pages_221-244_1999_An_r-Adaptive_Finite_Element_Method_Based_upon_Moving_Mesh_PDEs''","247934042_The_Numerical_Simulation_of_Twodimensional_Fluid_Flow_with_Strong_Shocks","246876030_Adaptive_Mesh_Methods_for_One-_and_Two-Dimensional_Hyperbolic_Conservation_Laws","243778029_Weighted_Essentially_Non-Oscillatory_Schemes_for_the_Interpolation_of_Mean_Values_on_Unstructured_Grids","243765858_Uniformly_high_order_essentially_non-oscillatory_schemes_III","240357203_Towards_Very_High_Order_Godunov_Schemes","237487663_High-Reynolds_Number_Viscous_Flow_Computations_Using_Unstructured-Grid_Method","228561097_Efficient_kinetic_schemes_for_steady_and_unsteady_flow_simulations_on_unstructured_meshes","223719687_Spectral_Finite_Volume_Method_for_Conservation_Laws_on_Unstructured_Grids_Basic_Formulation_Basic_Formulation","222832170_An_adaptive_moving_mesh_method_for_two-dimensional_ideal_magnetohydrodynamics","222691371_A_unified_moving_grid_gas-kinetic_method_in_Eulerian_space_for_viscous_flow_computation","222684636_Developing_High-Order_Weighted_Compact_Nonlinear_Schemes","222673533_Accurate_efficient_and_monotonic_numerical_methods_for_multi-dimensional_compressible_flows_Part_II_Multi-dimensional_limiting_process","222658323_A_Gas-Kinetic_BGK_Scheme_for_the_Navier-Stokes_Equations_and_Its_Connection_with_Artificial_Dissipation_and_Godunov_Method","222649030_Spectral_difference_method_for_unstructured_grids_I_Basic_formulation","222504051_An_r-Adaptive_Finite_Element_Method_Based_upon_Moving_Mesh_PDEs","222498889_A_Discontinuous_Galerkin_ALE_Method_for_Compressible_Viscous_Flows_in_Moving_Domains","222498390_An_Arbitrary_Lagrangian-Eulerian_Computing_Method_for_All_Flow_Speeds","222478486_The_Runge-Kutta_Discontinuous_Galerkin_Method_for_Conservation_Laws_V","222039220_Uniformly_high_order_accurate_essentially_non-oscillatory_schemes_III_Reprint","220206683_High_order_multi-moment_constrained_finite_volume_method_Part_I_Basic_formulation","220206674_Remapping-free_ALE-type_kinetic_method_for_flow_computations","51992314_Weighted_Essentially_Non-Oscillatory_Schemes","44348890_The_Mathematical_Theory_of_Non-Uniform_Gas","38327204_Adaptive_Mesh_Redistibution_Method_Based_on_Godunov's_Scheme","24383997_Efficient_Implementation_of_Weighted_ENO_Schemes","24323478_On_Essentially_Non-oscillatory_Schemes_on_Unstructured_Meshes_Analysis_and_Implementation","24301696_Weighted_Essentially_Non-Oscillatory_Schemes_on_Triangular_Meshes","2857873_A_Perspective_on_Unstructured_Grid_Flow_Solvers","2337174_The_Development_of_Discontinuous_Galerkin_Methods"]}
