{"id":"301632057_Meka_A_Multi-labelMulti-target_Extension_to_Weka","abstract":"Multi-label classification has rapidly attracted interest in the machine learning literature, and there are now a large number and considerable variety of methods for this type of learning. We present MEKA: an open-source Java framework based on the well-known WEKA library. MEKA provides interfaces to facilitate practical application, and a wealth of multi-label classifiers, evaluation metrics, and tools for multi-label experiments and development. It supports multi-label and multi-target data, including in incremental and semi-supervised contexts.
