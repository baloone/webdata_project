{"id":"337725121_An_Empirically_Evaluated_Checklist_for_Surveys_in_Software_Engineering","abstract":"Context: Over the past decade Software Engineering research has seen a steady increase in survey-based studies, and there are several guidelines providing support for those willing to carry out surveys. The need for auditing survey research has been raised in the literature. Checklists have been used both to conduct and to assess different types of empirical studies, such as experiments and case studies.\nObjective: To operationalize the assessment of survey studies by means of a checklist. To fulfill such goal, we aim to derive a checklist from standards for survey research and further evaluate the appropriateness of the checklist in the context of software engineering research.\nMethod: We systematically aggregated knowledge from 12 methodological studies supporting survey-based re- search in software engineering. We identified the key stages of the survey process and its recommended practices through thematic analysis and vote counting. We evaluated the checklist by applying it to existing surveys and analyzed the results. Thereafter, we gathered the feedback of experts (the surveysâ€™ authors) on our analysis and used the feedback to improve the survey checklist.\nResults: The evaluation provided insights regarding limitations of the checklist in relation to its understanding and objectivity. In particular, 19 of the 38 checklist items were improved according to the feedback received from experts.\nConclusion: The proposed checklist is appropriate for auditing survey reports as well as a support tool to guide ongoing research with regard to the survey design process. A discussion on how to use the checklist and what its implications are for research practice is also provided.","authors":["Jefferson Seide Molleri","Kai Petersen","Emilia Mendes"],"meta":["December 2019Information and Software Technology 119:106240","DOI:10.1016/j.infsof.2019.106240"],"references":["308499179_Surveys_in_Software_Engineering_Identifying_Representative_Samples","286933786_A_Survey_on_Software_Architectural_Assumptions","278967185_Investigating_probabilistic_sampling_approaches_for_large-scale_surveys_in_software_engineering","276062061_Guidelines_for_Conducting_Surveys_in_Software_Engineering","275892054_Characterizing_Sampling_Frames_in_Software_Engineering_Surveys","261260566_A_framework_of_software_process_tailoring_for_small_and_medium_size_IT_companies","257439331_Worldviews_Research_Methods_and_their_Relationship_to_Validity_in_Empirical_Software_Engineering_Research","228708239_Strategies_for_Ensuring_Trustworthiness_in_Qualitative_Research_Projects","226750589_Reporting_Experiments_in_Software_Engineering","224266207_Recommended_Steps_for_Thematic_Synthesis_in_Software_Engineering","222827396_Empirical_studies_of_agile_software_development_A_systematic_review","221494984_Strength_of_Evidence_in_Systematic_Reviews_in_Software_Engineering","221494751_Can_we_evaluate_the_quality_of_software_engineering_experiments","42540827_CONSORT_2010_statement_updated_Guidelines_for_Reporting_Parallel_Group_Randomised_Trials","5969804_Consolidated_Criteria_for_Reporting_Qualitative_Research_COREQ_A_32-Item_Checklist_for_Interviews_and_Focus_Groups","4279065_Checklists_for_Software_Engineering_Case_Study_Research","4250891_The_Future_of_Empirical_Methods_in_Software_Engineering_Research","4083425_Case_studies_for_software_engineers","336576131_An_Evaluation_of_Quality_Checklist_Proposals_-_A_participant-observer_case_study","327276456_CERSE_-_Catalog_for_Empirical_Research_in_Software_Engineering_A_Systematic_Mapping_Study","312915659_Practical_experiences_in_the_design_and_conduct_of_surveys_in_empirical_software_engineering","308500722_Is_there_a_Future_for_Empirical_Software_Engineering","284535612_Survey_Research_in_the_United_States_Roots_and_Emergence_1890-1960","275616109_The_Survey_Research_Handbook","266661827_Sampling_improvement_in_software_engineering_surveys","266661757_Towards_a_framework_to_support_large_scale_sampling_in_software_engineering_surveys","265422800_Designing_an_Effective_Survey","263596940_An_Assessment_of_Survey_Research_in_POM_From_Constructs_to_Theory","261497451_Six_reasons_for_rejecting_an_industrial_survey_paper","261440673_A_Critical_Examination_of_Recent_Industrial_Surveys_on_Agile_Method_Usage","261075518_Lessons_learned_from_evaluating_a_checklist_for_reporting_experimental_and_observational_research","242401332_Experimental_design_and_analysis_in_software_engineering","225888418_Personal_Opinion_Surveys","220591935_Survey_Research_Methodology_in_Management_Information_Systems_An_Assessment","26734640_Weighted_Kappa_-_Nominal_Scale_Agreement_with_Provision_for_Scaled_Disagreement_Or_Partial_Credit","4194154_Reporting_guidelines_for_controlled_experiments_in_software_engineering","4038458_Conducting_on-line_surveys_in_software_engineering","3363517_DESMET_A_methodology_for_evaluating_software_engineering_methods_and_tools","3247083_Case_Studies_for_Method_and_Tool_Evaluation"]}
