{"id":"276364392_Dynamic_Cloud_Instance_Acquisition_via_IaaS_Cloud_Brokerage","abstract":"Infrastructure-as-a-Service clouds offer diverse pricing options, including on-demand and reserved instances with various discounts to attract different cloud users. A practical problem facing cloud users is how to minimize their costs by choosing among different pricing options based on their own demands. In this paper, we propose a new cloud brokerage service that reserves a large pool of instances from cloud providers and serves users with price discounts. The broker optimally exploits both pricing benefits of long-term instance reservations and multiplexing gains. We propose dynamic strategies for the broker to make instance reservations with the objective of minimizing its service cost. These strategies leverage dynamic programming and approximation algorithms to rapidly handle large volumes of demand. Our extensive simulations driven by large-scale Google cluster-usage traces have shown that significant price discounts can be realized via the broker.","authors":["Wei Wang","Di Niu","Ben Liang","Baochun Li"],"meta":["June 2015IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems 26(6):1580-1593","DOI:10.1109/TPDS.2014.2326409"],"references":["261355881_Optimal_Resource_Rental_Planning_for_Elastic_Applications_in_Cloud_Market","254032016_Quality-assured_cloud_bandwidth_auto-scaling_for_video-on-demand_applications","241622616_CIPT_Using_tuangou_to_reduce_IP_transit_costs","220422375_A_View_of_Cloud_Computing","314472607_Dynamic_server_provisioning_to_minimize_cost_in_an_IaaS_cloud","301924303_See_spot_run_Using_spot_instances_for_mapreduce_workflows","266435524_Algorithmic_game_theory_Foreword_by_Christos_H_Papadimitriou","266257773_Approximate_Dynamic_Programming_Solving_the_Curses_of_Dimensionality","262326398_Heterogeneity_and_dynamicity_of_clouds_at_scale_Google_trace_analysis","261245720_Dynamic_Cloud_Resource_Reservation_via_Cloud_Brokerage","254031694_Optimal_bidding_in_spot_instance_market","236935530_To_Reserve_or_Not_to_Reserve_Optimal_Online_Multi-Instance_Acquisition_in_IaaS_Clouds","232640787_Optimization_of_Resource_Provisioning_Cost_in_Cloud_Computing","222410212_Cloud_Computing_and_Emerging_IT_Platforms_Vision_Hype_and_Reality_for_Delivering_Computing_as_the_5th_Utility","2839475_Resource_Overbooking_and_Application_Profiling_in_Shared_Hosting_Platforms","2389565_On_the_Bahncard_Problem"]}
