{"id":"265687647_A_new_encoding_of_coalescent_processes_Applications_to_the_additive_and_multiplicative_cases","abstract":"We revisit the discrete additive and multiplicative coalescents, starting\nwith $n$ particles with unit mass. These cases are known to be related to some\n\"combinatorial coalescent processes\": a time reversal of a fragmentation of\nCayley trees or a parking scheme in the additive case, and the random graph\nprocess $(G(n,p))_p$ in the multiplicative case. Time being fixed, encoding\nthese combinatorial objects in real-valued processes indexed by the line is the\nkey to describing the asymptotic behaviour of the masses as $n\\to +\\infty$.\nWe propose to use the Prim order on the vertices instead of the classical\nbreadth-first (or depth-first) traversal to encode the combinatorial coalescent\nprocesses. In the additive case, this yields interesting connections between\nthe different representations of the process. In the multiplicative case, it\nallows one to answer to a stronger version of an open question of Aldous [Ann.\nProbab., vol. 25, pp. 812--854, 1997]: we prove that not only the sequence of\n(rescaled) masses, seen as a process indexed by the time $\\lambda$, converges\nin distribution to the reordered sequence of lengths of the excursions above\nthe current minimum of a Brownian motion with parabolic drift $(B_t+\\lambda t -\nt^2/2, t\\geq 0)$, but we also construct a version of the standard augmented\nmultiplicative coalescent of Bhamidi, Budhiraja and Wang [Probab. Theory Rel.,\nto appear] using an additional Poisson point process.","authors":["Nicolas Broutin","Jean-Fran√ßois Marckert"],"meta":["October 2016Probability Theory and Related Fields 166(1-2)","DOI:10.1007/s00440-015-0665-1","SourcearXiv"],"references":["346057975_Foundations_of_Modern_Probability","313183025_Description_d'un_mecanisme_de_connexion_de_liaision_destine_a_l'etude_du_drainage_avec_piegeage_en_milieu_poreux","306157654_Shortest_Connection_Networks_and_Some_Generalizations","305977987_On_a_conditionally_Poissonian_graph_process","298537500_Combinatorial_stochastic_processes_-_Saint-Flour_Summer_School_of_Probabilities_XXXII_-_2002","284890653_O_jistem_problemu_minimalnim","281381403_Drei_Vortrage_uber_diffusion_brownshe_molekularbewegung_and_koagulation_von_kolloidolteilchen","272590888_The_augmented_multiplicative_coalescent_bounded_size_rules_and_critical_dynamics_of_random_graphs","268496537_Random_Graphs","265411251_CAMBRIDGE_STUDIES_IN_ADVANCED_MATHEMATICS_78"]}
