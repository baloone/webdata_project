{"id":"262316108_Cube_attack_in_finite_fields_of_higher_order","abstract":"We present in full details a version of the Dinur-Shamir Cube Attack (Dinur & Shamir 2009) for a generic finite field of order q. In particular, when applied to multivariate monomials of degree d in k < d variables, the attack acts exactly in the same way if the selected monomial was using the degree k monomial in the same k variables.","authors":["Andrea Agnesse","Marco Pedicini"],"meta":["January 2011","Conference: Proceedings of the Ninth Australasian Information Security Conference - Volume 116"],"references":["220333050_Breaking_ONEFIVIUM_by_AIDA_an_Algebraic_IV_Differential_Attack","225925972_Cube_Attacks_on_Tweakable_Black_Box_Polynomials","221291706_Fast_Exhaustive_Search_for_Polynomial_Systems_in_F2","30816376_Cube_Testers_and_Key_Recovery_Attacks_on_Reduced-Round_MD6_and_Trivium"]}
