{"id":"283278242_A_k-Vector_Approach_to_Sampling_Interpolation_and_Approximation","abstract":"The k-vector search technique is a method designed to perform extremely fast range searching of large databases at computational cost independent of the size of the database. k-vector search algorithms have historically found application in satellite star-tracker navigation systems which index very large star catalogues repeatedly in the process of attitude estimation. Recently, the k-vector search algorithm has been applied to numerous other problem areas including non-uniform random variate sampling, interpolation of 1-D or 2-D tables, nonlinear function inversion, and solution of systems of nonlinear equations. This paper presents algorithms in which the k-vector search technique is used to solve each of these problems in a computationally-efficient manner. In instances where these tasks must be performed repeatedly on a static (or nearly-static) data set, the proposed k-vector-based algorithms offer an extremely fast solution technique that outperforms standard methods.","authors":["Daniele Mortari","Jonathan Rogers"],"meta":["October 2015Journal of the Astronautical Sciences 60(3-4)","DOI:10.1007/s40295-015-0065-x"],"references":["265231476_Star_pattern_recognition_and_mirror_assembly_misalignment_for_digistar_II_and_III_multiple_FOVs_star_sensors","254199748_Lost-in-Space_Pyramid_Algorithm_for_Robust_Star_Pattern_Recognition","254199734_Search-Less_Algorithm_for_Star_Pattern_Recognition","254199673_A_Fast_On-Board_Autonomous_Attitude_Determination_System_Based_ona_New_Star-ID_Technique_for_a_Wide_FOV_Star_Tracker","254199553_Lost_in_Space_A_Star_Patter_Recognition_and_Attitude_EstimationApproach_for_the_Case_of_No_A_Priori_Attitude_Information","2590205_Sequential_Monte_Carlo_Methods_for_Dynamic_Systems","271512891_Monte_Carlo_Filter_and_Smoother_for_Non-Gaussian_Nonlinear_State_Space_Models","270445909_Mathematical_Theory_of_Probability_and_Statistics","267016968_Mathematical_Theory_of_Probability_and_Statistics","254199754_Towards_the_Most_Accurate_Attitude_Determination_System_using_StarTrackers","254199728_SP-Search_A_New_Algorithm_for_Star_Pattern_Recognition","242383225_Dispersion_on_a_Sphere","241677739_k-Vector_Range_Searching_Technique","236563643_Nuclear_Reactor_Theory","235105235_BOOM_A_Computer-Aided_Engineering_Tool_for_Exterior_Ballistics_of_Smart_Projectiles","228999366_The_Pyramid_Star_Identification_Technique","228057919_Various_techniques_used_in_connection_with_random_digits","220780302_Fast_Algorithms_for_Sorting_and_Searching_Strings","220049082_In_Directional_Statistics","3357548_Improved_particle_filter_for_nonlinear_problems","3318218_A_Tutorial_on_Particle_Filters_for_Online_NonlinearNon-Gaussian_Bayesian_Tracking"]}
