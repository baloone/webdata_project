{"id":"260393502_On_the_Algebraic_Structure_of_Linear_Tail-Biting_Trellises","abstract":"Trellises are crucial graphical representations of codes. While conventional\ntrellises are well understood, the general theory of (tail-biting) trellises is\nstill under development. Iterative decoding concretely motivates such theory.\nIn this paper we first develop a new algebraic framework for a systematic\nanalysis of linear trellises which enables us to address open foundational\nquestions. In particular, we present a useful and powerful characterization of\nlinear trellis isomorphy. We also obtain a new proof of the Factorization\nTheorem of Koetter/Vardy and point out unnoticed problems for the group case.\nNext, we apply our work to: describe all the elementary trellis\nfactorizations of linear trellises and consequently to determine all the\nminimal linear trellises for a given code; prove that nonmergeable one-to-one\nlinear trellises are strikingly determined by the edge-label sequences of\ncertain closed paths; prove self-duality theorems for minimal linear trellises;\nanalyze quasi-cyclic linear trellises and consequently extend results on\nreduced linear trellises to nonreduced ones. To achieve this, we also provide\nnew insight into mergeability and path connectivity properties of linear\ntrellises.\nOur classification results are important for iterative decoding as we show\nthat minimal linear trellises can yield different pseudocodewords even if they\nhave the same graph structure.","authors":["David Conti","Nigel Boston"],"meta":["February 2014IEEE Transactions on Information Theory 61(5)","DOI:10.1109/TIT.2015.2401040","SourcearXiv"],"references":["237817679_Unifying_Views_of_Tail-Biting_Trellises_for_Linear_Block_Codes","220897883_Minimal_Tail-Biting_Trellises_for_Certain_Cyclic_Block_Codes_Are_Easy_to_Construct","3084983_Lower_Bounds_on_the_State_Complexity_of_Linear_Tail-Biting_Trellises","2823952_Tail-Biting_Trellises_of_Block_Codes_Trellis_Complexity_and_Viterbi_Decoding_Complexity","2568125_Minimal_Tail-Biting_Trellises_for_Certain_Cyclic_Block_Codes_Are_Easy_to_Construct","2408031_Codes_and_Decoding_on_General_Graphs","321593757_Codes_Graphs_and_Systems_A_Celebration_of_the_Life_and_Career_of_G_David_Forney_Jr_on_the_Occasion_of_his_Sixtieth_Birthday","261465878_The_Factorization_Theorem_and_new_algebraic_insights_into_the_theory_of_linear_trellises","253894705_Iterative_Decoding_of_Tail-Biting_Trellises_and_Connections_with_Symbolic_Dynamics","247036292_On_the_effective_weights_of_pseudo-codewords_for_codes_defined_on_graphs_with_cycles","243777741_Trellis_structure_of_codes","242014576_Codes_on_Graphs_Fundamentals","239762445_Matrix_representations_of_trellises_and_enumerating_trellis_pseudocodewords","239458722_Classification_of_Certain_Tail-Biting_Generators_for_the_Binary_Golay_Code","233922816_Local_Irreducibility_of_Tail-Biting_Trellises","224733795_On_Tail_Biting_Conventional_Codes","224213229_Linear_Tail-Biting_Trellises_Characteristic_Generators_and_the_BCJR-Construction","224213226_Minimal_Realizations_of_Linear_Systems_The_Shortest_Basis_Approach","221700575_Codes_on_Graphs_Observability_Controllability_and_Local_Reducibility","221662326_Reducing_complexity_of_tail-biting_trellises","220683438_The_Structure_of_Tail-Biting_Trellises_Minimality_and_Basic_Principles","220681289_Codes_on_graphs_Normal_realizations","48192034_Characteristic_Generators_and_Dualization_for_Tail-Biting_Trellises","41478432_Iterative_decoding_and_pseudo-codewords","38003073_Decoding_Error-Correcting_Codes_via_Linear_Programming","23868793_A_Connection_Between_Block_and_Convolutional_Codes","3764818_Construction_of_minimal_tail-biting_trellises","3085381_A_Relation_Between_the_Characteristic_Generators_of_a_Linear_Code_and_its_Dual","3084814_The_Structure_of_Tail-Biting_Trellises_Minimality_and_Basic_Principles","3082386_Optimal_Decoding_of_Linear_Codes_for_Minimizing_Symbol_Error_Rate","3080576_Tailbiting_codes_Bounds_and_search_results","3080333_Codes_on_graphs_Normal_realizations","3080138_Linear_tail-biting_trellises_the_square-root_bound_and_applications_for_Reed-Muller_codes","3079860_Minimal_tail-biting_trellises_The_Golay_code_and_more","3079118_Proof_of_a_conjecture_of_McEliece_regarding_the_expansion_index_of_the_minimal_trellis","3078999_On_the_BCJR_trellis_for_linear_block_codes","3078877_On_the_Trellis_Structure_of_Block_Codes","3078330_The_Dynamics_of_Group_Codes_State_Spaces_Trellis_Diagrams_and_Canonical_Encoders","3077302_Coset_Codes-Part_II_Binary_Lattices_and_Related_Codes","3077273_Minimal_trellises_for_block_codes","2555423_On_The_Effective_Weights_Of_Pseudocodewords_For_Codes_Defined_On_Graphs_With_Cycles","2526739_On_the_Theory_of_Linear_Trellises","2522023_On_the_Representation_of_Codes_in_Forney_Graphs","1958845_Graph-Cover_Decoding_and_Finite-Length_Analysis_of_Message-Passing_Iterative_Decoding_of_LDPC_Codes"]}
