{"id":"313479107_Teaching_Spatial_Geometry_in_a_Virtual_World_Using_Minecraft_in_Mathematics_in_Grade_56","abstract":"Spatial geometry is one of the fundamental mathematical building blocks of any engineering education. However, it is overshadowed by planar geometry in the curriculum between playful early primary education and later analytical geometry, leaving a multi-year gap where spatial geometry is absent at large. Hence, we investigate the usage of Minecraft as tool to help bridge said gap, as the virtual worlds of Minecraft allow children to create three-dimensional objects in a constructive and algorithmic way. We study two learning scenarios in grade 5/6 with 103 students, reporting on our & the childrensâ€™ experiences. Based on our findings, we believe Minecraft to be a valuable mathematical tool that can be easily used to augment the current curriculum.","authors":["Klaus-Tycho Foerster"],"meta":["April 2017","DOI:10.1109/EDUCON.2017.7943032","Conference: 8th IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON)At: Athens, Greece","Project: Algorithms in Education"],"references":["301232882_Mining_Learning_and_Crafting_Scientific_Experiments_A_Literature_Review_on_the_Use_of_Minecraft_in_Education_and_Research","267507986_Learning_mathematics_through_Minecraft_Authors","267135810_Design_of_a_Math_Learning_Game_Using_a_Minecraft_Mod","254060168_The_Uncanny_Valley_From_the_Field","236587414_Teaching_Scientific_Concepts_using_a_Virtual_World_-_Minecraft","2642436_Construct3D_A_Virtual_Reality_Application_for_Mathematics_and_Geometry_Education","312449083_Exploring_Minecraft_as_a_conduit_for_increasing_interest_in_programming","308007252_A_Concept_for_an_Introduction_to_Parallelization_in_Java_Multithreading_with_Programmable_Robots_in_Minecraft","308007008_Integrating_Programming_into_the_Mathematics_Curriculum_Combining_Scratch_and_Geometry_in_Grades_6_and_7","304073561_Influence_of_the_Programming_Environment_on_Programming_Education","304055328_Geometry_Explorer_Facilitating_Geometry_Education_with_Virtual_Reality","304020254_Geometrie_in_der_Grundschule","302074262_Studying_the_Impact_of_Spatial_Involvement_on_Training_Mental_Rotation_with_Minecraft","301931572_Haptic_Retargeting_Dynamic_Repurposing_of_Passive_Haptics_for_Enhanced_Virtual_Reality_Experiences","295401243_Didaktik_der_Geometrie_fur_die_Sekundarstufe_I","294345528_Dynamic_mathematics_with_GeoGebra","254003885_Visual_immersive_mathematics_in_3D_web","246776364_Mathematical_Enculturation_A_Cultural_Perspective_on_Mathematics_Education","238790090_Use_of_Virtual_Reality_Computing_in_Spatial_Learning_Research","44546901_Mathematical_Enculturation_A_Cultural_Perspective_on_Mathematics_Education"]}
