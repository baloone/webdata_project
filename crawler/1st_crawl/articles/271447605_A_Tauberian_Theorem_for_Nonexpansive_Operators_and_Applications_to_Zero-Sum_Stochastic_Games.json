{"id":"271447605_A_Tauberian_Theorem_for_Nonexpansive_Operators_and_Applications_to_Zero-Sum_Stochastic_Games","abstract":"We prove a Tauberian theorem for nonexpansive operators, and apply it to the\nmodel of zero-sum stochastic game. Under mild assumptions, we prove that the\nvalue of the lambda-discounted game v_{lambda} converges uniformly when lambda\ngoes to 0 if and only if the value of the n-stage game v_n converges uniformly\nwhen n goes to infinity. This generalizes the Tauberian theorem of Lehrer and\nSorin (1992) to the two-player zero-sum case. We also provide the first example\nof a stochastic game with public signals on the state and perfect observation\nof actions, with finite state space, signal sets and action sets, in which for\nsome initial state k_1 known by both players, (v_{lambda}(k_1)) and (v_n(k_1))\nconverge to distinct limits.","authors":["Bruno Ziliotto"],"meta":["January 2015Mathematics of Operations Research 41(4)","DOI:10.1287/moor.2016.0788","SourcearXiv"],"references":["234083194_Existence_of_the_uniform_value_in_repeated_games_with_a_more_informedcontroller","227262162_Asymptotic_behavior_of_nonexpansive_mappings_in_normed_linear_spaces","4733266_Absorbing_Games_with_Compact_Action_Spaces","312982657_Stochastic_games","286374742_An_operator_approach_to_zero-sum_repeated_games","281496506_Recursive_games_uniform_value_Tauberian_theorem_and_the_Mertens_conjecture_Maxminlim_v_nlim_v_uplambda_M_a_x_m_i_n_lim_v_n_lim_v_l","277722905_Recursive_games_Uniform_value_Tauberian_theorem_and_the_Mertens_conjecture_Maxminlim_v_nlim_v_lambda","268863672_Stochastic_games_and_applications_Lectures_given_at_the_NATO_Advanced_Study_Institute_on_Stochastic_games_and_applications_Stony_Brook_NY_USA_July_1999_On_the_occasion_of_L_S_Shapley's_eightieth_birth","263891769_Hidden_Stochastic_Games_and_Limit_Equilibrium_Payoffs","244955780_A_First_Course_on_Zero-Sum_Repeated_Games","244506915_The_Asymptotic_Theory_of_Stochastic_Games","242930076_A_Uniform_Tauberian_Theorem_in_Dynamic_Programming","236871711_Zero-sum_repeated_games_Counterexamples_to_the_existence_of_the_asymptotic_value_and_the_conjecture_maxmin_lim_nn","234412201_A_Zero-Sum_Stochastic_Game_with_Compact_Action_Sets_and_no_AsymptoticValue","232710006_The_Value_of_Markov_Chain_Games_with_Incomplete_Information_on_Both_Sides","227025584_Stochastic_games","226251217_On_stochastic_games","225340183_An_operator_approach_to_zero-sum_repeated_games","45913694_A_Uniform_Tauberian_Theorem_in_Optimal_Control","38361508_Universally_Measurable_Strategies_in_Zero-Sum_Stochastic_Games","5201761_Blackwell_Optimality_in_Markov_Decision_Processes_with_Partial_Observation","1915753_Uniform_value_in_Dynamic_Programming"]}
