{"id":"297803867_Putting_water_in_its_place_a_perspective_on_GIS_in_hydrology_and_water_management","abstract":"The use of GIS (geographical information systems) in hydrology and water management has its roots in ideas about the relationship between climate, catchment, channel and society that emerged more than a hundred years ago. From these beginnings, hydrological GIS has come to be defined primarily by modelling in the science domain and by asset (notably infrastructure) management in the water and river management domain. In both contexts it can be demonstrated that data quality represents the ultimate constraint, but that the quest for higher resolution may carry with it some significant problems. These constraints are developed through an examination of the potential use of high resolution spatial data in flood insurance applications of GIS. While the issues raised have clear technical implications, they also have important professional and ethical ramifications which are worthy of consideration as a backdrop to the current and future status of GIS in hydrology and water management.
