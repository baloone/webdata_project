{"id":"340652160_Analysis_of_Student_Mistakes_in_Completing_Matrix_Problems_in_The_Linear_Algebra_Course","abstract":"Linear Algebra is a material that students generally get in high school, but there is no specification regarding sub-chapters in the material. Therefore, students must understand this concept well. Linear Algebra is a preliminary course, in which students will proceed to the Operations Research Engineering course. The research method used was descriptive qualitative research. The subjects of this study were the fourth-semester students of Informatics Engineering, Faculty of Computer Science at Banten Jaya University. Sampling was done purposively because there were significant differences between the other classes. The instrument in this study was a test consisting of 7 problem descriptions. The results of this study indicate that students make some mistakes in solving matrix problems, namely the results of matrix multiplication, the sum of the matrix, the writing of negative signs, and the writing of the matrix form.","authors":["Nur Hidayanti"],"meta":["March 2020Journal of Physics Conference Series 1477(4):042046","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/1477/4/042046"],"references":["333846760_ANALISIS_KESALAHAN_SISWA_DALAM_MENYELESAIKAN_PERMASALAHAN_OPERASI_BENTUK_ALJABAR","330474820_Analisis_Kesalahan_Mahasiswa_Dalam_Menyelesaikan_Soal_Matematika_Pada_Pokok_Bahasan_Vektor","328383406_Cognitive_conflict_strategy_to_minimize_students'_misconception_on_the_topic_of_addition_of_algebraic_expression","318089527_ANALISIS_KESULITAN_YANG_DIHADAPI_OLEH_GURU_DAN_PESERTA_DIDIK_SEKOLAH_MENENGAH_PERTAMA_DALAM_IMPLEMENTASI_KURIKULUM_2013_PADA_MATA_PELAJARAN_MATEMATIKA_Studi_Kasus_Eks-Karesidenan_Madiun","330961091_ANALISIS_KESALAHAN_SISWA_DALAM_MENYELESAIKAN_PERMASALAHAN_INTEGRAL_TAK_TENTU"]}
