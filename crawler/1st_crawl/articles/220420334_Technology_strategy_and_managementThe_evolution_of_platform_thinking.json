{"id":"220420334_Technology_strategy_and_managementThe_evolution_of_platform_thinking","abstract":"Michael Cusumano shares his views on the way platform adoption can be an important determinant of product and technological success. The development of advanced computers and smartphones is associated with the development of software development tools and applications or wireless telephony and Internet services. The companies that develop these tools need to have a strategy to open their technology to complementors and create economic incentives for other firms to join the same ecosystem and adopt the platform technology as their own. This process will allow their technology to be adopted by the whole industry. Another key factor is that the critical distinguishing feature of an industry platform and ecosystem is the creation of network effects. These are positive feedback loops that can grow at increasing rates as adoption of the platform and the complements rise.","authors":["Michael A.
