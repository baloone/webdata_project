{"id":"3419385_Access_control_and_session_management_in_the_HTTP_environment","abstract":"As the only ubiquitous public data network, the Internet offers\nbusiness partners a communications channel that previously existed only\nin unique situations with private, special-purpose networks.\nWell-publicized security risks, however, have limited the deployment of\nbusiness-to-business extranets, which typically use the Internet's\npublic data network infrastructure. These risks extend behind firewalls\nto intranets, where any user gaining entry to a facility is often\nimplicitly authenticated to access unprotected services by simply\nplugging a portable computer into an unused network port. The author\ndescribes an approach that uses role-based access controls (RBACs) and\nWeb session management to protect against network security breaches in\nthe HTTP environment. The RBAC and session management services augment\nnetwork-level security, such as firewalls, inherent in the deployment of\nany Web based system with untrusted interfaces. The RBACs are\nimplemented through the Internet Engineering Task Force's Lightweight\nDirectory Access Protocol (LDAP). Session management is implemented\nthrough cryptographically secured, cookie-based ticket mechanisms","authors":["K.
