The nodes of mobile ad hoc\nnetworks are susceptible to compromise. In such a scenario,\ndesigning a trustworthy and secure routing protocol has\nbeen a major challenge over the last many years. This paper\nstudy the impact of pause time of our propose Trust Based\nSecure On Demand Routing Protocol called “TSDRP” and\nAd hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing\nprotocol for making it secure to thwart attacks like\nBlackhole attack and DoS attack. To evaluate the\nperformances, we have considered Packet Delivery Fraction\n(PDF), Average End-to-End Delay (AED), Average\nThroughput (AT) and Normalized Routing Load (NRL).","authors":["Nirbhay Chaubey"],"meta":["March 2015","Conference: Effect of Pause Time on AODV and TSDRP Routing Protocols Under Black Hole Attack and DoS Attacks in MANETsAt: Delhi","Project: Security in Mobile Cloud Computing Environment"],"references":["277255608_Optimized_link_state_routing_protocol_OLSR","270394473_Optimized_link_state_routing_protocol_OLSRP","260409751_Trust_Based_Secure_on_Demand_Routing_Protocol_TSDRP_for_MANETs","260409417_NDTAODV_Neighbor_Defense_Technique_for_Ad_Hoc_On-Demand_Distance_Vector_AODV_to_Mitigate_Flood_Attack_in_Manets","258396739_A_Credible_Routing_Based_on_a_Novel_Trust_Mechanism_in_Ad_Hoc_Networks","252044474_Towards_secure_route_discovery_protocol_in_MANET","251934496_Preventing_black_hole_attack_in_mobile_ad-hoc_networks_using_Anomaly_Detection","310670788_Ad-hoc_on-demand_distance_vector_AODV_routing","266596491_TSRD-RL_algorithm_based_secured_route_discovery_for_MANET_with_improved_route_lifetime","251990661_Trust_based_secured_adhoc_On_demand_Distance_Vector_Routing_protocol_for_mobile_adhoc_network"]}
