{"id":"288438032_Assessment_of_a_new_and_improved_course_for_the_development_of_3-D_spatial_skills","abstract":"Since 1993, Michigan Tech has offered a course aimed at improving the spatial skills of incoming engineering students who have a demonstrated weakness in ability as measured by the Purdue Spatial Visualization Test: Rotations (PSVT:R). In the fall of 2000, this course was altered dramatically in terms of both content and instructional delivery method. The modified course was described in detail in a paper presented at a previous EDGD annual conference. This paper will outline the changes made in the delivery of the course, examine results from the revised course, and compare findings with results from the previous version of the course. Particular attention will be paid to changes in success and retention rates among students with weak initial spatial skills.","authors":["Sheryl Sorby"],"meta":["September 2005Engineering Design Graphics Journal 69(3):6-13"],"references":["281222283_Hereditary_and_Environmental_Components_of_Quantitative_Reasoning","234560309_Sexual_Stereotyping_and_Mathematics_Learning"]}
