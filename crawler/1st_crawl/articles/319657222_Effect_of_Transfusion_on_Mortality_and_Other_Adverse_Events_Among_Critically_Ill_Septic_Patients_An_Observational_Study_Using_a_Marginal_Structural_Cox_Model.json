{"id":"319657222_Effect_of_Transfusion_on_Mortality_and_Other_Adverse_Events_Among_Critically_Ill_Septic_Patients_An_Observational_Study_Using_a_Marginal_Structural_Cox_Model","abstract":"Objectives: \nRBC transfusion is often required in patients with sepsis. However, adverse events have been associated with RBC transfusion, raising safety concerns. A randomized controlled trial validated the 7 g/dL threshold, but previously transfused patients were excluded. Cohort studies led to conflicting results and did not handle time-dependent covariates and history of treatment. Additional data are thus warranted to guide patient's management.\n\nDesign: \nTo estimate the effect of one or more RBC within 1 day on three major outcomes (mortality, ICU-acquired infections, and severe hypoxemia) at day 30, we used marginal structural models. A trajectory modeling, based on hematocrit evolution pattern, allowed identification of subgroups. Secondary analyses were performed into each of them.\n\nSetting: \nA prospective French multicenter database.\n\nPatients: \nPatients with sepsis at admission. Patients with hemorrhagic shock at admission were excluded.\n\nInterventions: \nNone.\n\nMeasurements and main results: \nOverall, in our cohort of 6,016 patients, RBC transfusion was not associated with death (hazard ratio, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.88-1.30; p = 0.52). However, RBC transfusion was associated with increased occurrence of ICU-acquired infections (hazard ratio, 2.77; 95% CI, 2.33-3.28; p < 0.01) and of severe hypoxemia (hazard ratio, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.14-1.47; p < 0.01). A protective effect from death by the transfusion was found in the subgroup with the lowest hematocrit level (26 [interquartile range, 24-28]) (hazard ratio, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.55-0.95; p = 0.02).\n\nConclusions: \nRBC transfusion did not affect overall mortality in critically ill patients with sepsis. Increased occurrence rate of ICU-acquired infection and severe hypoxemia are expected outcomes from RBC transfusion that need to be weighted with its benefits in selected patients.","authors":["Claire Dupuis","Maité Garrouste-Orgeas","Sébastien Bailly","Christophe Adrie"],"meta":["September 2017Critical Care Medicine 45(12):1","DOI:10.1097/CCM.0000000000002688"],"references":["312049878_Impact_of_transfusion_on_patients_with_sepsis_admitted_in_intensive_care_unit_a_systematic_review_and_meta-analysis","279306277_What's_new_in_the_quantification_of_causal_effects_from_longitudinal_cohort_studies_a_brief_introduction_to_marginal_structural_models_for_intensivists","271216846_A_randomized_trial_of_protocol-based_care_for_early_septic_shock","266644631_Goal-directed_resuscitation_for_patients_with_early_septic_shock_The_ARISE_Investigators_and_the_ANZICS_Clinical_Trials_Group_NEJM_2014_371_1496_506_101056NEJMoa1404380","266384779_Lower_versus_Higher_Hemoglobin_Threshold_for_Transfusion_in_Septic_Shock","260398133_Red_blood_cell_transfusion_in_septic_shock_-_clinical_characteristics_and_outcome_of_unselected_patients_in_a_prospective_multicentre_cohort","236636084_Pseudomonas_Aeruginosa_Ventilator-Associated_Pneumonia_Predictive_Factors_of_Treatment_Failure","221883891_Red_blood_cell_transfusion_during_septic_shock_in_the_ICU","51660673_Red_blood_cell_transfusion_and_outcomes_in_patients_with_acute_lung_injury_sepsis_and_shock","51581661_Attributable_Mortality_of_Ventilator-Associated_Pneumonia_A_Reappraisal_Using_Causal_Analysis","51127237_The_impact_of_packed_red_blood_cell_transfusion_on_clinical_outcomes_in_patients_with_septic_shock_treated_with_early_goal_directed_therapy","49715515_Transfusion-Related_Risk_of_Secondary_Bacterial_Infections_in_Sepsis_Patients","44625606_Anemia_and_blood_transfusion_in_a_surgical_Intensive_Care_Unit","41654923_Group-Based_Trajectory_Modeling_in_Clinical_Research","11564907_Early_Goal-Directed_Therapy_In_The_Treatment_Of_Severe_Sepsis_And_Septic_Shock","11146747_Anemia_and_Blood_Transfusion_in_Critically_Ill_Patients","10802279_Clinical_Outcomes_Following_Institution_of_the_Canadian_Universal_Leukoreduction_Program_for_Red_Blood_Cell_Transfusions","7079555_Recurrent_catheter-related_bloodstream_infections_Risk_factors_and_outcome","6283878_Red_blood_cell_transfusions_and_the_risk_of_acute_respiratory_distress_syndrome_among_the_critically_ill_A_cohort_study","5417771_Risk_factors_for_the_development_of_acute_lung_injury_in_patients_with_septic_shock_An_observational_cohort_study","303771703_Continuous_renal_replacement_therapy_versus_intermittent_hemodialysis_in_intensive_care_patients_impact_on_mortality_and_renal_recovery","279413199_Use_of_a_Marginal_Structural_Model_to_Determine_the_Effect_of_Aspirin_on_Cardiovascular_Mortality_in_the_Physicians'_Health_Study","276067855_A_systematic_review_and_meta-analysis_of_early_goal-directed_therapy_for_septic_shock_the_ARISE_ProCESS_and_ProMISe_Investigators","275296431_A_Multicenter_Randomized_Controlled_Clinical_Trial_of_Transfusion_Requirements_in_Critical_Care","273700280_Failure_of_Empirical_Systemic_Antifungal_Therapy_in_Mechanically_Ventilated_Critically_Ill_Patients","273079239_Comparison_of_Approaches_to_Weight_Truncation_for_Marginal_Structural_Cox_Models","262070845_A_Randomized_Trial_of_Protocol-Based_Care_for_Early_Septic_Shock","261293318_Health_Care-Associated_Infection_After_Red_Blood_Cell_Transfusion_A_Systematic_Review_and_Meta-analysis","259107062_The_Protocolised_Management_in_Sepsis_ProMISe_trial_statistical_analysis_plan","230849294_Red_blood_cell_transfusions_are_associated_with_lower_mortality_in_patients_with_severe_sepsis_and_septic_shock_A_propensity-matched_analysis","230612055_Acute_respiratory_distress_syndrome_the_Berlin_DefinitionARDS_Definition_Task_ForceJAMA20123072526253322797452","224910626_Marginal_Structural_Models_and_Causal_Inference_in_Epidemiology","13317171_A_Multicenter_Randomized_Controlled_Clinical_Trial_of_Transfusion_Requirements_in_Critical_Care","11337215_Use_of_a_marginal_structural_model_to_determine_the_effect_of_aspirin_on_cardiovascular_mortality_in_the_Physicians'_Health_Study","11266499_Estimating_causal_effect_of_zidovudine_on_CD4_count_with_a_marginal_structural_model_for_repeated_measures","7800739_Clinical_predictors_of_and_mortality_in_acute_respiratory_distress_syndrome_Potential_role_of_red_cell_transfusion","7741536_International_Sepsis_Forum_Definition_of_Infection_in_the_ICU_Consensus_Conference","7589195_International_sepsis_definitions_conference_2001SCCMESICMACCPATSSIS_international_sepsis_definitions_conference"]}
