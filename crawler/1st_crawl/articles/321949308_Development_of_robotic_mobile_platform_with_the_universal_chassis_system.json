{"id":"321949308_Development_of_robotic_mobile_platform_with_the_universal_chassis_system","abstract":"The problem of stabilizing the position of mobile devices is extremely relevant at the modern level of technology development. This includes the problem of stabilizing aircraft and stabilizing the pitching of ships. In the laboratory of robotics and mechatronics of the Kuban State University, a robot is developed. The robot has additional internal degrees of freedom, responsible for compensating for deflections-the dynamic stabilization system.","authors":["Igor Ryadchikov","Evgeny V.
