{"id":"282906517_repAIrC_A_Tool_for_Ensuring_Data_Consistency_-_By_Means_of_Active_Integrity_Constraints","abstract":"Consistency of knowledge repositories is of prime importance in organization\nmanagement. Integrity constraints are a well-known vehicle for specifying data\nconsistency requirements in knowledge bases; in particular, active integrity\nconstraints go one step further, allowing the specification of preferred ways\nto overcome inconsistent situations in the context of database management. This\npaper describes a tool to validate an SQL database with respect to a given set\nof active integrity constraints, proposing possible repairs in case the\ndatabase is inconsistent. The tool is able to work with the different kinds of\nrepairs proposed in the literature, namely simple, founded, well-founded and\njustified repairs. It also implements strategies for parallelizing the search\nfor them, allowing the user both to compute partitions of independent or\nstratified active integrity constraints, and to apply these partitions to find\nrepairs of inconsistent databases efficiently in parallel.","authors":["Lu√≠s Cruz-Filipe","Michael Franz","Artavazd Hakhverdyan","Marta Ludovico"],"meta":["October 2015","DOI:10.5220/0005586400170026","SourcearXiv"],"references":["314500732_What_is_Knowledge_Management","266552075_Optimizing_Computation_of_Repairs_from_Active_Integrity_Constraints","261227811_Computing_Repairs_from_Active_Integrity_Constraints","246568298_Its_All_in_Our_Heads","239665785_Cambridge_tracts_in_theoretical_computer_science","222450274_On_the_complexity_of_propositional_knowledge_base_revision_updates_and_counterfactuals","221336348_Active_integrity_constraints","221322432_Updates_A_New_Frontier","220788261_Prioritized_Active_Integrity_Constraints_for_Database_Maintenance","220073493_Active_Integrity_Constraints_for_Database_Consistency_Maintenance"]}
