{"id":"298875755_Notes_on_triangular_sets_and_triangulation-decomposition_algorithms_-_II_Differential_systems","abstract":"This is the second in a series of two tutorial articles devoted to triangulation-decomposition algorithms. The value of these notes resides in the uniform presentation of triangulation-decomposition of polynomial and differential radical ideals with detailed proofs of all the presented results. We emphasize the study of the mathematical objects manipulated by the algorithms and show their properties independently of those. We also detail a selection of algorithms, one for each task. The present article deals with differential systems. It uses results presented in the first article on polynomial systems but can be read independently.","authors":["E Hubert"],"meta":["January 2003Lecture Notes in Computer Science","Conference: 2nd International Conference on Symbolic and Numerical ScientificVolume: 2630"],"references":["227023146_Automated_reasoning_in_differential_geometry_and_mechanics_using_the_characteristic_set_method_-_Part_II_Mechanical_theorem_proving","2430106_Existence_and_Uniqueness_Theorems_for_Formal_Power_Series_Solutions_of_Analytic_Differential_Systems","282615455_The_Differential_Ideal_P_M","268763259_On_the_singular_solutions_of_algebraic_differential_equations","232840831_Legislating_the_past_Cultural_resource_management_in_the_US_Forest_Service","227305089_Sur_les_equations_differentielles_du_troisieme_et_d'ordre_superieur_dont_l'integrale_generale_a_ses_points_critiques_fixes","223608359_Differential-algebraic_decision_methods_and_some_applications_to_system_theory","223408657_Differential_Algebra_Methods_for_the_Study_of_the_Structural_Identifiability_of_Rational_Function_State-Space_Models_in_the_Biosciences","222604610_A_Generalized_Euclidean_Algorithm_for_Computing_Triangular_Representations_of_Algebraic_Varieties","222529300_Factorization-free_Decomposition_Algorithms_in_Differential_Algebra","222506267_Nonclassical_Reductions_of_a_31-Cubic_Nonlinear_Schrodinger_System","222498867_Computer_algebra_solving_of_second_order_ODEs_using_symmetry_methods","222441181_Computer_Algebra_Solving_of_First_Order_ODEs_Using_Symmetry_Methods","222307026_Essential_Components_of_an_Algebraic_Differential_Equation","221055216_Reasoning_about_Surfaces_Using_Differential_Zero_and_Ideal_Decomposition","220642998_Mechanical_Theorem_Proving_in_the_Local_Theory_of_Surfaces","220537645_Resolvent_Representation_for_Regular_Differential_Ideals","220161348_Unmixed-dimensional_Decomposition_of_a_Finitely_Generated_Perfect_Differential_Ideal","2709372_Rankings_of_Partial_Derivatives","2204889_Symmetry_Reductions_and_Exact_Solutions_of_a_class_of_Nonlinear_Heat_Equations"]}
