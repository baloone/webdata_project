{"id":"318597691_Python_como_primer_lenguaje_de_programacion_textual_en_la_Ensenanza_Secundaria","abstract":"With the recent introduction of Programming in the K-12 curricula there is an opportunity to include Computer Science fundamental concepts. This paper presents the origin and evolution of Python as well as their main features that configure it as an ideal programming language. We also review and classify some educational tools in the Python ecosystem. Such tools cover a wide-open spectrum of resources from interactive books to libraries which ease the construction of student elaborated software artefacts. This work presents a multidisciplinary proposal to use the Python programming language in all levels of Secondary Stage.","authors":["José Carlos GARCÍA MONSÁLVEZ"],"meta":["July 2017Education in the Knowledge Society (EKS) 18(2):147","DOI:10.14201/eks2017182147162"],"references":["321940359_TACCLE_3_O5_An_overview_of_the_most_relevant_literature_on_coding_and_computational_thinking_with_emphasis_on_the_relevant_issues_for_teachers","309622733_Is_Python_an_Appropriate_Programming_Language_for_Teaching_Programming_in_Secondary_Schools","308880760_What_Computational_Thinking_Is","308409950_An_Analysis_of_Introductory_University_Programming_Courses_in_the_UK","308345778_Proyecto_TACCLE3_-_Coding","311760890_Stop_propagating_the_learning_styles_myth","311314199_A_review_of_models_for_introducing_computational_thinking_computer_science_and_computing_in_K-12_education","310809036_A_brief_introduction_to_TACCLE_3_-_coding_European_project","310792069_The_long_quest_for_computational_thinking","306925727_Implementing_an_Open-Access_Data_Science_Programming_Environment_for_Learners"]}
