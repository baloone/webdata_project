{"id":"325747178_Developing_cost_model_for_preliminary_estimate_of_road_projects_in_Nigeria","abstract":"This paper was aimed at developing cost models to predict the \npreliminary estimate of road projects in Nigeria at the early state using \nparametric estimating techniques. To achieve this, there is need to identify both \nthe quantitative and qualitative factors that affects the construction cost of road \nprojects. The used procedure resulted in the formulation of linear and multiple \nregression models which provide a means of determining the cost of road \nfunctional activities as a function of projects characteristics. The models \ndeveloped were for seven major construction activities based on 50 sets of data \ncollected from road projects executed within between 2010 and 2015 in South \nWestern Nigeria. The addition of all elements will give the probable cost of the \nroad project. The coefficient of determination r2 for the developed models \nranged from 0.85 to 0.99 indicating that the predicted values from a forecast \nmodels fit with the real-life data. \n\nKeywords: cost modelling; construction estimating; project management; road \nproject; cost factor.","authors":["Adedayo Ogungbile","Ayodeji Emmanuel Oke","Kehinde Rasak"],"meta":["January 2018","DOI:10.1504/IJSRECE.2018.092277"],"references":["281402462_Establishing_a_common_ground_for_the_use_of_structural_equation_modelling_for_construction_related_research_studies","281314066_Assessment_of_facility_management_practices_in_public_and_private_buildings_in_Akure_and_Ibadan_cities_south-western_Nigeria","266023730_THE_CAUSE_FACTORS_OF_LARGE_PROJECT'S_COST_OVERRUN_A_SURVEY_IN_THE_SOUTHERN_PART_OF_PENINSULAR_MALAYSIA","255792517_Construction_project_financing_for_sustainable_development_of_Nigerian_cities","238746511_Preliminary_Cost_Estimating_Models_for_Road_Construction_Activities","235644840_INFRASTRUCTURE_DELAYS_AND_COST_ESCALATION_CAUSES_AND_EFFECTS_IN_NIGERIA","284778900_Preliminary_cost_estimation_of_highway_construction_using_neural_networks","269674332_Road_transportation_as_lifeline_of_the_economy_in_Western_Nigeria_1920_to_1952","245306407_Classification_of_Road_Surface_Profiles","235267435_A_model_for_contractors'_selection_in_Nigeria"]}
