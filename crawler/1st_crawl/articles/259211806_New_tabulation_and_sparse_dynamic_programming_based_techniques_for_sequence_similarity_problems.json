We present two algorithms for LCS length\ncalculation with respectively $O(mn \\log\\log n / \\log^2 n)$ and $O(mn / \\log^2\nn + r)$ time complexity, the latter working for $r = o(mn / (\\log n \\log\\log\nn))$, where $r$ is the number of matches in the dynamic programming matrix. We\nalso describe conditions for a given problem sufficient to apply our\ntechniques, with several concrete examples presented, namely the edit distance,\nLCTS and MerLCS problems.","authors":["Szymon Grabowski"],"meta":["December 2013Discrete Applied Mathematics 212","DOI:10.1016/j.dam.2015.10.040","SourcearXiv"],"references":["255653463_Improved_Time_and_Space_Complexities_for_Transposition_Invariant_String_Matching","228728416_Efficient_sparse_dynamic_programming_for_the_merged_LCS_problem_with_block_constraints","220618168_A_Subquadratic_Sequence_Alignment_Algorithm_for_Unrestricted_Scoring_Matrices","220432231_Sparse_Dynamic_Programming_I_Linear_Cost_Functions","2834818_A_Sub-quadratic_Sequence_Alignment_Algorithm_for_Unrestricted_Scoring_Matrices","278718117_Subcubic_Algorithms_for_the_Sequence_Excluded_LCS_Problem","266012917_Finding_a_longest_common_subsequence_between_a_run-length-encoded_string_and_an_uncompressed_string","263985714_Bit-parallel_algorithms_for_the_merged_longest_common_subsequence_problem","262162762_Faster_Algorithm_for_Computing_the_Edit_Distance_between_SLP-Compressed_Strings","256181761_An_information-theoretic_lower_bound_for_the_longest_common_subsequence_problem","222945634_Speeding_up_transposition-invariant_string_matching","222700132_Fast_and_Compact_Regular_Expression_Matching","222681040_Transposition_invariant_string_matching","222661570_Efficient_algorithms_for_finding_interleaving_relationship_between_sequences","222447182_A_Faster_Algorithm_Computing_String_Edit_Distances","220444506_Bit-Parallel_Algorithm_for_the_Constrained_Longest_Common_Subsequence_Problem","220431498_Bounds_for_the_String_Editing_Problem","220422318_A_Fast_Algorithm_for_Computing_Longest_Common_Subsequences","220238721_A_Fast_On-Line_Algorithm_for_the_Longest_Common_Subsequence_Problem_with_Constant_Alphabet","3871316_A_survey_of_longest_common_subsequence_algorithms","2939102_Bit-Parallel_LCS-length_Computation_Revisited","2817551_String_Editing_and_Longest_Common_Subsequence"]}
