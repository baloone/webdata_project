{"id":"353208240_From_data_mining_to_wisdom_mining","abstract":"The knowledge gained from data mining is highly dependent on the experience of an expert for further analysis to increase effectiveness and wise decision-making. This mined knowledge requires actionability enhancement before it can be applied to real-world problems. The literature highlights the reasons that emerged the need to incorporate human wisdom in decision-making for complex problems. To solve this problem, a domain called ‘Wisdom Mining’ is recommended, proposing a set of algorithms parallel to the algorithms proposed by the data mining. In wisdom mining, a process to extract wisdom needs to be defined with less influence from an expert. This review proposed improvements to data mining techniques and their applications in the real world and emphasised the need to seek ways to harness wisdom from data. This study covers the diverse definitions and different perspectives of wisdom within philosophy, psychology, management and computer science. This comprehensive literature review served as a foundation for constructing a wise decision framework that aided in identifying the wisdom factors like context, utility, location and time. The inclusion of these wisdom factors in existing data mining algorithms makes the transition from data mining to wisdom mining possible. This research includes the relationship between these two mining process that facilitated further elucidation of the wisdom mining process. Potential research trends in the domain are also seen as a potential endeavour to improve the analysis and use of data.","authors":["Salma Khan","Muhammad Shaheen"],"meta":["July 2021Journal of Information Science","DOI:10.1177/01655515211030872"],"references":["347052919_A_Paradigm-Shifting_From_Domain-Driven_Data_Mining_Frameworks_to_Process-Based_Domain-Driven_Data_Mining-Actionable_Knowledge_Discovery_Framework","345005323_A_survey_of_density_based_clustering_algorithms","342208867_An_Empirical_Study_of_Observation-weighting_Method_for_Mining_Actionable_Behavioral_Rules","341262005_Actionable_knowledge_discovery_from_social_networks_using_causal_structures_of_structural_features","345646387_Using_a_Revised_Knowledge_Pyramid_to_Redefine_Knowledge_Management_Strategy","342910967_Extreme_Clustering_-_A_Clustering_Method_via_Density_Extreme_Points","340078899_A_Review_on_Enhancement_to_Standard_K-Means_Clustering","338436367_Personalized_Recommendation_System_Based_on_Collaborative_Filtering_for_IoT_Scenarios","338424699_Grid_based_clustering_for_satisfiability_solving","337634315_Partitioning_and_hierarchical_based_clustering_a_comparative_empirical_assessment_on_internal_and_external_indices_accuracy_and_time","336892821_Density-based_clustering","334815475_The_GH-EXIN_neural_network_for_hierarchical_clustering","335499841_Dimensional_Situation_Analytics_An_Introduction_and_Its_Application_Prospects","333195590_A_Cross-Domain_Collaborative_Filtering_Algorithm_with_Expanding_User_and_Item_Features_via_the_Latent_Factor_Space_of_Auxiliary_Domains","332738281_Performance_Evaluation_of_Clustering_Algorithms_for_Varying_Cardinality_and_Dimensionality_of_Data_Sets"]}
