{"id":"308361962_High-Efficiency_Urban_Traffic_Management_in_Context-Aware_Computing_and_5G_Communication","abstract":"With the increasing number of vehicle and traffic jams, urban-traffic management is becoming a serious issue. In this article, we propose novel four-tier architecture for urban-traffic management with the convergence of vehicle ad hoc networks (VANETs), 5G wireless network, software-defined network (SDN), and mobile-edge computing (MEC) technologies. The proposed architecture provides better communication and rapider responsive speed in a more distributed and dynamic manner. The practical case of rapid accident rescue can significantly cut down the time for rescue. Key technologies with respect to vehicle localization, data pre-fetching, traffic lights control, and traffic prediction are also discussed. Obviously, the novel architecture shows noteworthy potential for alleviating the traffic congestion and improving the efficiency of urban-traffic management.","authors":["Jianqi Liu","Jiafu Wan","Dongyao(Tony) Jia","Bi Zeng"],"meta":["September 2016IEEE Communications Magazine 55(1)","DOI:10.1109/MCOM.2017.1600371CM","Project: Transportation Cyber-physical Systems Design to Automated Driving"],"references":["290227469_Mobile_Crowd_Sensing_for_Traffic_Prediction_in_Internet_of_Vehicles","283466671_Software_defined_networking-based_vehicular_Adhoc_Network_with_Fog_Computing","283117532_Reliable_and_Efficient_Autonomous_Driving_The_Need_for_Heterogeneous_Vehicular_Networks","280485206_Radio-Aware_Service-Level_Scheduling_to_Minimize_Downlink_Traffic_Delay_Through_Mobile_Edge_Computing","276348174_Cloud-Assisted_Speech_and_Face_Recognition_Framework_for_Health_Monitoring","271472780_Towards_software-defined_VANET_Architecture_and_services","264561683_Context-Aware_Vehicular_Cyber-Physical_Systems_with_Cloud_Support_Architecture_Challenges_and_Solutions","293015630_Cloud-assisted_Industrial_Internet_of_Things_IIoT_-_Enabled_framework_for_health_monitoring","290509714_IDoctor_Personalized_and_professionalized_medical_recommendations_based_on_hybrid_matrix_factorization","288904293_Software_defined_healthcare_networks","283753012_ART_An_Attack-Resistant_Trust_Management_Scheme_for_Securing_Vehicular_Ad_Hoc_Networks","282956452_Enabling_Real-Time_Context-Aware_Collaboration_through_5G_and_Mobile_Edge_Computing","222410212_Cloud_Computing_and_Emerging_IT_Platforms_Vision_Hype_and_Reality_for_Delivering_Computing_as_the_5th_Utility"]}
