{"id":"3296131_Trends_in_Cooperative_Distributed_Problem_Solving","abstract":"The authors present an overview of cooperative distributed problem solving (CDPS), an emerging research area that combines aspects of AI (artificial intelligence) and distributed processing. CDPS can be used to study how a loosely coupled network of sophisticated problem-solving nodes can solve a complex problem which consists of a set of interdependent subproblems. Subproblems arise because of spatial, temporal, and functional distribution of data, knowledge, and processing capabilities. Application areas include distributed interpretation, distributed planning and control, cooperating expert systems, and computer-supported human cooperation. The authors survey the important approaches and empirical investigations that have been developed. The approaches covered include negotiation, functionally accurate cooperation, organizational structuring, multiagent planning, sophisticated local control, and theoretical frameworks","authors":["Edmund H.
