{"id":"352362848_Zeit_in_Mathematik_und_Informatik","abstract":"Time questions occur in mathematics and computer science mainly in connection with determining the running time of algorithms and the classification of the time complexity of problem classes. I will sketch the associated complexity theory and its relation to real computing in practice. Examples will demonstrate the use of mathematics and computer\nscience in handling time issues in other fields. I finish with my personal perception of the “nature of time”. Time is today a term to which manifold and contradictory properties are attributed. We should stop believing that there is a “time per se”. Maybe one can state this as follows: It is time to give time a time-out.","authors":["Martin Grötschel"],"meta":["June 2021","DOI:10.26164/leopoldina_10_00274"],"references":["327623615_Philosophie_der_Zeit_--_Grundlagen_und_Perspektiven","262997353_The_birth_of_spacetime_atoms_as_the_passage_of_time"]}
