{"id":"321960003_Supporting_animal_welfare_with_automatic_tracking_of_giraffes_with_thermal_cameras","abstract":"Externally observing of animal behaviour is an essential method for understanding and improving captive animal welfare, but is limited by observer subjectivity and high-labour costs, and is not embedded in day-to-day care. In this paper, we present a solution via a system that utilizes a single thermal camera to automatically locate giraffes within their enclosure, matching human estimation accuracy. We present an account of the development of this system, our approach, and an evaluation through focus-group interviews with zoo-keepers which provide insight into the most appropriate visualisation methods, and the future opportunities for automatic tracking technologies to support husbandry practices, zoo visitor experiences, and conservation education.","authors":["Ruining Dong","Marcus Carter","Wally Smith","Zaher Joukhadar"],"meta":["November 2017","DOI:10.1145/3152771.3156142","Conference: the 29th Australian Conference"],"references":["309566956_Don't_Cut_to_the_Chase_Hunting_Experiences_for_Zoo_Animals_and_Visitors","305790293_Music_as_enrichment_for_Sumatran_orangutans_Pongo_abelii","303811830_Naturalism_and_ACI_Augmenting_Zoo_Enclosures_with_Digital_Technology","302873442_Using_Technology_Driven_Environments_to_Promote_Animal_Well-_Being_in_Zoos","301403225_Monitoring_Giraffe_Behavior_in_Thermal_Video","282407640_Application_of_a_computer_vision_technique_to_animal-borne_video_data_Extraction_of_head_movement_to_understand_sea_turtles'_visual_assessment_of_surroundings","278783507_HABIT_Horse_Automated_Behaviour_Identification_Tool_-_A_Position_Paper","276232167_Image_analysis_for_assessing_broiler_breeder_behavior_response_to_thermal_environment","274367664_Observing_the_unwatchable_through_acceleration_logging_of_animal_behavior","227258700_Collecting_and_Sharing_Location-based_Content_on_Mobile_Phones_in_a_Zoo_Visitor_Experience","223460657_A_complete_farm_management_system_based_on_animal_identification_using_RFID_technology","220382477_Animal-computer_interaction_A_manifesto","37597147_Bandpass_Channels_Zero-Crossings_and_Early_Visual_Information_Processing","12557085_Classification_of_rat_behavior_with_an_image-processing_method_and_a_neural_network","3940582_Rapid_Object_Detection_using_a_Boosted_Cascade_of_Simple_Features","3766402_General_framework_for_object_detection","2539247_Automatically_Tracking_and_Analyzing_the_Behavior_of_Live_Insect_Colonies","314928429_Kinecting_with_Orangutans_Zoo_Visitors'_Empathetic_Responses_to_Animals'_Use_of_Interactive_Technology","310748129_Sound_to_your_Objects_A_Novel_Design_Approach_to_Evaluate_Orangutans'_Interest_in_Sound-based_Stimuli","303293635_Interactive_Technology_and_Human-Animal_Encounters_at_the_Zoo","303107795_Vision_and_navigation_for_the_Carnegie-Mellon_Navlab","276420651_Envisioning_Future_Playful_Interactive_Environments_for_Animals","272381471_GPS_technology_as_a_proxy_tool_for_determining_relationships_in_social_animals_An_example_with_African_elephants","270819431_W_4_real-time_surveillance_of_people_and_theiractivities","263083702_The_effects_of_GPS_collars_on_African_elephant_Loxodonta_africana_behavior_at_the_San_Diego_Zoo_Safari_Park","233103012_Giraffe_Thermoregulation_A_review","225070191_A_Decision-Theoretic_Generalization_of_On-Line_Learning_and_an_Application_to_Boosting","224254936_Stable_Multi-Target_Tracking_in_Real-Time_Surveillance_Video","223088134_Volumetric_model_and_3D_trajectory_of_a_moving_car_derived_from_monocular_TV_frames_of_a_street_scene","222381383_Gray-level_corner_detection","3231925_A_digital_acoutic_recording_tag_for_measuring_the_response_of_wild_marine_mammals_to_sound","3193132_W4_Real-time_surveillance_of_people_and_their_activities_IEEE_Trans_Pattern_Anal_Mach_Intell","2239823_Good_Features_to_Track"]}
