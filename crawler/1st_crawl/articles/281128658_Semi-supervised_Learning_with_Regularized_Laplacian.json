{"id":"281128658_Semi-supervised_Learning_with_Regularized_Laplacian","abstract":"We study a semi-supervised learning method based on the similarity graph and\nRegularizedLaplacian. We give convenient optimization formulation of the\nRegularized Laplacian method and establishits various properties. In\nparticular, we show that the kernel of the methodcan be interpreted in terms of\ndiscrete and continuous time random walks and possesses several\nimportantproperties of proximity measures. Both optimization and linear algebra\nmethods can be used for efficientcomputation of the classification functions.\nWe demonstrate on numerical examples that theRegularized Laplacian method is\ncompetitive with respect to the other state of the art semi-supervisedlearning\nmethods.","authors":["K.
