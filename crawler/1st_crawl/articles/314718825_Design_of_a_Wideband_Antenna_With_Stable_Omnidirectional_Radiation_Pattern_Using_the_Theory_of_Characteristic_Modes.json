{"id":"314718825_Design_of_a_Wideband_Antenna_With_Stable_Omnidirectional_Radiation_Pattern_Using_the_Theory_of_Characteristic_Modes","abstract":"In this communication, the design procedure of a wideband antenna with omnidirectional radiation pattern is demonstrated based on the theory of characteristic modes. Consisting of a dipole and a loop antenna, the antenna has a very simple structure. A wide impedance bandwidth is obtained because of the simultaneous excitation of the antenna’s first two modes. Meanwhile, due to the fact that these two modes share a similar omnidirectional radiation pattern, a stable radiation pattern is also achieved across the operating frequency band. In order to identify the antenna’s different modes, a characteristic mode analysis of the antenna is carried out first. Then, a feed configuration is specifically designed to excite the desired modes. To validate the antenna design, a prototype was fabricated and tested. Measured results agree well with the simulated ones. Measurement shows that a wide impedance bandwidth of 44.2% with |S11|<-10 dB (1.85-2.9 GHz) and stable radiation patterns at both E-plane and H-plane were achieved over the operating frequency band.","authors":["Dingliang Wen","Yang Hao","Hanyang Wang","Hai Zhou"],"meta":["March 2017IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TAP.2017.2679767","Project: Theory of Characteritstic Modes"],"references":["298902507_Design_of_a_Wideband_Tunable_4-port_MIMO_Antenna_System_with_High_Isolation_Based_on_the_Theory_of_Characteristic_Modes","273176804_A_Broadband_Dual-Polarized_Antenna_With_Y-Shaped_Feeding_Lines","261112229_A_broadband_dual-polarization_antenna_element_for_wireless_communication_base_station","258792718_A_Broadband_Unidirectional_Multi-Dipole_Antenna_With_Very_Stable_Beamwidth","297898104_Compact_multimode_multielement_antenna_for_indoor_UWB_massive_MIMO","273181937_Manipulation_of_Characteristic_Wave_Modes_by_Impedance_Loading","273178676_Wideband_Stub-Loaded_Slotline_Antennas_Under_Multi-Mode_Resonance_Operation","271665540_Characteristic_Modes_Theory_and_Applications_in_Antenna_Engineering","258792455_Novel_Dual-Broadband_Planar_Antenna_and_Its_Array_for_2G3GLTE_Base_Stations","258433128_Antenna_Theory_Analysis_and_Design"]}
