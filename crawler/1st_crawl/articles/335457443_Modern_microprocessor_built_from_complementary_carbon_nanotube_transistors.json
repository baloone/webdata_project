{"id":"335457443_Modern_microprocessor_built_from_complementary_carbon_nanotube_transistors","abstract":"Electronics is approaching a major paradigm shift because silicon transistor scaling no longer yields historical energy-efficiency benefits, spurring research towards beyond-silicon nanotechnologies. In particular, carbon nanotube field-effect transistor (CNFET)-based digital circuits promise substantial energy-efficiency benefits, but the inability to perfectly control intrinsic nanoscale defects and variability in carbon nanotubes has precluded the realization of very-large-scale integrated systems. Here we overcome these challenges to demonstrate a beyond-silicon microprocessor built entirely from CNFETs. This 16-bit microprocessor is based on the RISC-V instruction set, runs standard 32-bit instructions on 16-bit data and addresses, comprises more than 14,000 complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor CNFETs and is designed and fabricated using industry-standard design flows and processes. We propose a manufacturing methodology for carbon nanotubes, a set of combined processing and design techniques for overcoming nanoscale imperfections at macroscopic scales across full wafer substrates. This work experimentally validates a promising path towards practical beyond-silicon electronic systems.","authors":["Gage Hills","Christian Lau","Andrew Wright","Samuel Fuller"],"meta":["August 2019Nature 572(7771):595-602","DOI:10.1038/s41586-019-1493-8"],"references":["324704392_Growing_highly_pure_semiconducting_carbon_nanotubes_by_electrotwisting_the_helicity","322283162_Scalable_Preparation_of_High-Density_Semiconducting_Carbon_Nanotube_Arrays_for_High_Performance_Field-Effect_Transistors","318753929_Efficient_and_Reversible_Electron_Doping_of_Semiconductor-Enriched_Single-Walled_Carbon_Nanotubes_by_Using_Decamethylcobaltocene","307620227_Quasi-ballistic_carbon_nanotube_array_transistors_with_current_density_exceeding_Si_and_GaAs","330069275_The_N3XT_Approach_to_Energy-Efficient_Abundant-Data_Computing","328085821_Tunable_n-Type_Doping_of_Carbon_Nanotubes_Through_Engineered_Atomic_Layer_Deposition_HfOX_Films","327949438_Understanding_Energy_Efficiency_Benefits_of_Carbon_Nanotube_Field-Effect_Transistors_for_Digital_VLSI","323888433_Track_height_reduction_for_standard-cell_in_below_5nm_node_How_low_can_you_go","323820684_50_Years_of_computer_architecture_From_the_mainframe_CPU_to_the_domain-specific_tpu_and_the_open_RISC-V_instruction_set","322315957_Science_and_research_policy_at_the_end_of_Moore's_law","301830005_ASAP7_A_7-nm_finFET_predictive_process_design_kit","283644741_Progress_and_Challenges_in_VLSI_Placement_Research","303768789_Controlled_n-Type_Doping_of_Carbon_Nanotube_Transistors_by_an_Organorhodium_Dimer","301475972_Efficient_metallic_carbon_nanotube_removal_for_highly-scaled_technologies","286663484_Monolithic_three-dimensional_integration_of_carbon_nanotube_FETs_with_silicon_CMOS"]}
