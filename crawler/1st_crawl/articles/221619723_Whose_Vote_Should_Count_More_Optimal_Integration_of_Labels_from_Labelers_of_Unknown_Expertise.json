{"id":"221619723_Whose_Vote_Should_Count_More_Optimal_Integration_of_Labels_from_Labelers_of_Unknown_Expertise","abstract":"Modern machine learning-based approaches to computer vision require very large databases of hand labeled images. Some contemporary vision systems already require on the order of millions of images for training (e.g., Omron face detector (9)). New Internet-based services allow for a large number of labelers to collab- orate around the world at very low cost. However, using these services brings interesting theoretical and practical challenges: (1) The labelers may have wide ranging levels of expertise which are unknown a priori, and in some cases may be adversarial; (2) images may vary in their level of difficulty; and (3) multiple labels for the same image must be combined to provide an estimate of the actual label of the image. Probabilistic approaches provide a principled way to approach these problems. In this paper we present a probabilistic model and use it to si- multaneously infer the label of each image, the expertise of each labeler, and the difficulty of each image. On both simulated and real data, we demonstrate that the model outperforms the commonly used \"Majority Vote\" heuristic for inferring image labels, and is robust to both noisy and adversarial labelers.","authors":["Jacob Whitehill","Paul Ruvolo","Tingfan Wu","Jacob Bergsma"],"meta":["January 2009Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 22:2035-2043","SourceDBLP","Conference: Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 22: 23rd Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems 2009.
