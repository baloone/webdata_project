{"id":"270287451_Fast_and_accurate_determination_of_modularity_and_its_effect_size","abstract":"We present a fast spectral algorithm for community detection in complex\nnetworks. Our method searches for the partition with the maximum value of the\nmodularity via the interplay of several refinement steps that include both\nagglomeration and division. We validate the accuracy of the algorithm by\napplying it to several real-world benchmark networks. On all these, our\nalgorithm performs as well or better than any other known polynomial scheme.\nThis allows us to extensively study the modularity distribution in ensembles of\nErd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi networks, producing theoretical predictions for means and\nvariances inclusive of finite-size corrections. Our work provides a way to\naccurately estimate the effect size of modularity, providing a $z$-score\nmeasure of it and enabling a more informative comparison of networks with\ndifferent numbers of nodes and links.","authors":["Santiago Trevi√±o III","Amy Nyberg","Charo I.
