{"id":"231130919_Self-citation_corrections_for_the_Hirsch_index","abstract":"I propose to sharpen the index h, suggested by Hirsch as a useful index to characterize the scientific output of a researcher, by excluding the self-citations. Performing a self-experiment and also discussing in detail two anonymous data sets, it is shown that self-citations can significantly reduce the h index in contrast to Hirsch's expectations. This result is confirmed by an analysis of 13 further data sets.","authors":["Michael Schreiber"],"meta":["April 2007EPL (Europhysics Letters) 78(3):30002","DOI:10.1209/0295-5075/78/30002","SourcearXiv"],"references":["227512514_Using_the_h-index_to_rank_influential_information_scientistss_Brief_Communication","220365281_An_informetric_model_for_the_Hirsch-index_Scientometrics_691_121-129","220364636_Is_it_possible_to_compare_researchers_with_different_scientific_interests","46430178_On_the_H-index-A_mathematical_approach_to_a_new_measure_of_publication_activity_and_citation_impact","37619606_Refining_the_H-Index","28806524_On_the_Opportunities_and_Limitations_of_the_H-index","28804648_Simple_models_and_the_corresponding_h-_and_g-index","12244403_Connectivity_of_Growing_Random_Networks","11925403_Organization_of_Growing_Random_Networks","7080609_The_h_index_and_career_assessment_by_numbers","6617704_Measure_for_measures","2176508_Scaling_the_h-index_for_different_scientific_ISI_fields","2174529_Comparison_of_the_Hirsch-index_with_standard_bibliometric_indicators_and_with_peer_judgment","2173828_An_index_to_quantify_an_individual's_scientific_research_valid_across_disciplines","2173656_A_parameter_to_quantify_dynamics_of_a_researcher's_scientific_activity","2173158_Citation_Statistics_from_110_Years_of_Physical_Review","1946763_How_Popular_Is_Your_Paper_An_Empirical_Study_of_the_Citation_Distribution","1873456_Life_Death_and_Preferential_Attachment","253092316_Spacetime_Physics_Research_Trends","234014175_Does_the_H-index_for_ranking_scientists_really_work","228666580_Theory_and_Practice_of_the_g-Index","227600413_Dynamic_h-index_The_Hirsch_index_in_function_of_time_Brief_Communication","226143324_H-index_sequence_and_h-index_matrix_Constructions_and_applications","220364922_An_extension_of_the_Hirsch_Index_Indexing_scientific_topics_and_compounds","9067098_Citation_Networks_in_High_Energy_Physics","7652479_Index_aims_for_fair_ranking_of_scientists","7492196_An_Index_to_Quantify_An_Individual's_Scientific_Research_Output"]}
