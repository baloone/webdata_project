{"id":"224674143_Distributed_Neighbor_Discovery_in_Ad_Hoc_Networks_Using_Directional_Antennas","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a distributed neighbor discovery algorithm in ad hoc networks using directional antennas. A newly joining node obtains the information about its neighbors in both its omnidirectional and directional range by querying a subset of its omnidirectional neighbors. The main contribution of the proposed algorithm is that it does not require all neighbor nodes to be involved in the discovery process. Simulation results show that the algorithm performance closely tracks the theoretical analysis and only requires a fraction of the neighbors to be involved in the discovery process.","authors":["Rully Adrian Santosa","Bu Sung Lee","Chai Kiat Yeo","Teck Meng Lim"],"meta":["October 2006","DOI:10.1109/CIT.2006.82","SourceIEEE Xplore","Conference: Computer and Information Technology, 2006.
