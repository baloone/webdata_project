{"id":"261187028_Faster_algorithms_for_vertex_partitioning_problems_parameterized_by_clique-width","abstract":"Many NP-hard problems, such as Dominating Set, are FPT parameterized by clique-width. For graphs of clique-width k given with a k-expression,\nDominating Set can be solved in 4knO(1)4knO(1) time. However, no FPT algorithm is known for computing an optimal k -expression. For a graph of clique-width k , if we rely on known algorithms to compute a (23k−1)(23k−1)-expression via rank-width and then solving Dominating Set using the (23k−1)(23k−1)-expression, the above algorithm will only give a runtime of 423knO(1)423knO(1). There have been results which overcome this exponential jump; the best known algorithm can solve Dominating Set in time 2O(k2)nO(1)2O(k2)nO(1) by avoiding constructing a k -expression [Bui-Xuan, Telle, and Vatshelle. Fast dynamic programming for locally checkable vertex subset and vertex partitioning problems. Theoret. Comput. Sci. , 2013. doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tcs.2013.01.009]. We improve this to 2O(klogk)nO(1)2O(klogk)nO(1). Indeed, we show that for a graph of clique-width k , a large class of domination and partitioning problems (LC-VSP), including Dominating Set, can be solved in 2O(klogk)nO(1)2O(klogk)nO(1).\nOur main tool is a variant of rank-width using the rank of a 0-1 matrix over the rational field instead of the binary field.","authors":["Sang-il Oum","Sigve Hortemo Sæther","Martin Vatshelle"],"meta":["May 2014Theoretical Computer Science 535","DOI:10.1016/j.tcs.2014.03.024"],"references":["236260582_New_width_parameters_of_graphs","280806320_Proper_Interval_Vertex_Deletion","280688730_Algorithms_for_vertex_partitioning_problems_on_partial_-trees","269546011_A_Decomposition","269001981_Parametrized_complexity_theory","268072213_Lower_bounds_based_on_the_exponential_time_hypothesis","262215493_The_Rank-Width_of_the_Square_Grid","257650163_Invitation_to_Fixed-Parameter_Algorithms","236260583_Fast_dynamic_programming_for_locally_checkable_vertex_subset_and_vertex_partitioning_problems","236260578_Fast_dynamic_programming_for_locally_checkable_vertex_subset_and_vertex_partitioning_problems"]}
