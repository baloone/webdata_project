{"id":"268163428_Euclidean_partitions_optimizing_noise_stability","abstract":"The Standard Simplex Conjecture of Isaksson and Mossel [12] asks for the partition {Ai}i=1k of Rn into k ≤ n + 1 pieces of equal Gaussian measure of optimal noise stability. That is, for ρ > 0, we maximize Isaksson and Mossel guessed the best partition for this problem and proved some applications of their conjecture. For example, the Standard Simplex Conjecture implies the Plurality is Stablest Conjecture. For k = 3, n≥ 2 and 0 < ρ< ρ0(k; n), we prove the Standard Simplex Conjecture. The full conjecture has applications to theoretical computer science [12, 13, 19] and to geometric multi-bubble problems.","authors":["Steven Heilman"],"meta":["January 2014ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF PROBABILITY 19(71)","DOI:10.1214/EJP.v19-3083"],"references":["248382209_A_two-sided_estimate_for_the_Gaussian_noise_stability_deficit","228929620_Double_bubbles_in_Gauss_space_and_spheres","225116768_Jerrum_M_Improved_approximation_algorithms_for_Max_k-Cut_and_Max_Bisection_Algorithmica_181_67-81","220138499_Optimal_inapproximability_results_for_MAX-CUT_and_other_2-variable_CSPs","50908714_The_Grothendieck_Constant_is_Strictly_Smaller_than_Krivine's_Bound","285412361_Solution_of_the_Propeller_Conjecture_in_mathbb_R_3_R_3","279341620_Logarithmic_Sobolev_Inequalities","264957877_Logarithmic_Sobolev_inequalities_and_contractivity_properties_of_semigroups","260520661_Standard_Simplices_and_Pluralities_are_Not_the_Most_Noise_Stable","240747357_Noise_stability_of_functions_with_low_influences_invariance_and_optimality_Extended_Abstract","239055914_Isoperimetry_and_Gaussian_analysis","232244747_Robust_Optimality_of_Gaussian_Noise_Stability","228057732_Improved_approximation_algorithms_for_MAX_k-CUT_and_MAX_BISECTION","226429958_Geometric_bounds_on_the_Ornstein-Uhlenbeck_velocity_process","220779568_Towards_Computing_the_Grothendieck_Constant","220617606_Towards_Sharp_Inapproximability_for_Any_2-CSP","51964087_Solution_of_the_Propeller_Conjecture_in_R3","51930621_Grothendieck-Type_Inequalities_in_Combinatorial_Optimization","45858948_Sharp_kernel_clustering_algorithms_and_their_associated_Grothendieck_inequalities","44480214_Singular_Integrals_and_Differentiability_Properties_of_Functions","24165695_New_Maximally_Stable_Gaussian_Partitions_with_Discrete_Applications","4294377_Towards_Sharp_Inapproximability_For_Any_2-CSP","4186683_Noise_stability_of_functions_with_low_influences_Invariance_and_optimality","4109394_Optimal_inapproximability_results_for_MAX-CUT_and_other_2-variable_CSPs","2121894_A_generalization_of_the_Lindeberg_theorem","1744189_Approximate_Kernel_Clustering"]}
