{"id":"296641932_The_F-coindex_of_some_graph_operations","abstract":"The F-index of a graph is defined as the sum of cubes of the vertex degrees of the graph. In this paper, we introduce a new invariant which is named as F-coindex. Here, we study basic mathematical properties and the behavior of the newly introduced F-coindex under several graph operations such as union, join, Cartesian product, composition, tensor product, strong product, corona product, disjunction, symmetric difference of graphs and hence apply our results to find the F-coindex of different chemically interesting molecular graphs and nano-structures.","authors":["Nilanjan De","Sk.
