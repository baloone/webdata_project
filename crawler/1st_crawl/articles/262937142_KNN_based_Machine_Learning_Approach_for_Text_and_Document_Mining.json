{"id":"262937142_KNN_based_Machine_Learning_Approach_for_Text_and_Document_Mining","abstract":"Text Categorization (TC), also known as Text Classification, is the task of\nautomatically classifying a set of text documents into different categories\nfrom a predefined set. If a document belongs to exactly one of the categories,\nit is a single-label classification task; otherwise, it is a multi-label\nclassification task. TC uses several tools from Information Retrieval (IR) and\nMachine Learning (ML) and has received much attention in the last years from\nboth researchers in the academia and industry developers. In this paper, we\nfirst categorize the documents using KNN based machine learning approach and\nthen return the most relevant documents.","authors":["Vishwanath Bijalwan","Pinki Kumari","Jord√°n Pascual Espada","Vijay Bhaskar Semwal"],"meta":["June 2014","DOI:10.14257/ijdta.2014.7.1.06","SourcearXiv"],"references":["261173848_A_Fault-Tolerant_Mobile_Computing_Model_Based_On_Scalable_Replica","259194531_Human_Activity_Recognition_Using_Gait_Pattern","313169415_Brainwave's_energy_feature_extraction_using_wavelet_transform","283383774_A_Comparative_Study_on_Machine_Learning_Algorithms_in_Emotion_State_Recognition_Using_ECG","276028293_A_new_filter_algorithm","271131533_A_Comparative_Study_on_Machine_Learning_Algorithms_in_Emotion_State_Recognition_Using_ECG","269309600_Brainwave's_energy_feature_extraction_using_wavelet_transform","266461943_A_clustering_model_based_on_an_evolutionary_algorithm_for_better_energy_use_in_crop_production","254034174_Improved_KNN_classification_algorithms_research_in_text_categorization","239764321_Use_of_ARIMA_Mathematical_Analysis_to_Model_the_Implementation_of_Expert_System_Courses_by_Means_of_Free_Software_OpenSim_and_Sloodle_Platforms_in_Virtual_University_Campuses"]}
