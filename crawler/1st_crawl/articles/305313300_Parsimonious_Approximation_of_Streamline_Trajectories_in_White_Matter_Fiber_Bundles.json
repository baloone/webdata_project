{"id":"305313300_Parsimonious_Approximation_of_Streamline_Trajectories_in_White_Matter_Fiber_Bundles","abstract":"Fiber bundles stemming from tractography algorithms contain many streamlines. They require therefore a great amount of computer memory and computational resources to be stored, visualised and processed. We propose an approximation scheme for fiber bundles which results in a parsimonious representation of weighted prototypes. Prototypes are chosen among the streamlines and they represent groups of similar streamlines. Their weight is related to the number of approximated streamlines. Both streamlines and prototypes are modelled as weighted currents. This computational model does not need point-to-point correspondences and two streamlines are considered similar if their endpoints are close to each other and if their pathways follow similar trajectories. Moreover, the space of weighted currents is a vector space with a closed-form metric. This permits easy computation of the approximation error and the selection of the prototypes is based on the minimisation of this error. We propose an iterative algorithm which approximates independently and simultaneously all the fascicles of the bundle in a fast and accurate way. We show that the resulting representation preserves the shape of the bundle and it can be used to accurately reconstruct the original structural connectivity.We evaluate our algorithm on bundles obtained from both deterministic and probabilistic tractography algorithms. The resulting approximations use on average only 2% of the original streamlines as prototypes. This drastically reduces the computational burden of the processes where the geometry of the streamlines is considered. We demonstrate its effectiveness using as example the registration between two fiber bundles.","authors":["Pietro Gori","Olivier Colliot","Linda Marrakchi-Kacem","Worbe Yulia"],"meta":["July 2016IEEE
