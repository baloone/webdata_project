{"id":"329589237_Metamodeling_of_high-contrast-index_gratings_for_color_reproduction","abstract":"We propose a metamodel-based optimization technique to tailor the chromatic response of high-contrast-index\ngratings. The algorithm, which couples a population-based metaheuristic with a neural network, is used to re-\ntrieve the optimal geometrical parameters of a grating to reproduce a prescribed color. By means of some exam-\nples, we assess the possibilities and limitations of our optimization scheme. The numerical evidence found shows\nthat the metamodel approach offers an alternative to traditional metaheuristic techniques that not only provides\nthe best solution for a given geometry and a material but also significantly improves the computing time required\nfor the optimization process.","authors":["Victor Kalt","Alma K.
