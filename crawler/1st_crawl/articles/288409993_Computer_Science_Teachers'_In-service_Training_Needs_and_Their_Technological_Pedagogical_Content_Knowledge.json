{"id":"288409993_Computer_Science_Teachers'_In-service_Training_Needs_and_Their_Technological_Pedagogical_Content_Knowledge","abstract":"This study examines a national sample of 1127 computer science teachers who teach algorithms and programming in upper secondary education; it measures their knowledge with respect to three key domains as described by the TPACK framework: technology, pedagogy, content, and the combination of these areas. According to the results in the TPACK subscales, teachers state that their knowledge is between the values 4.38 (Content Knowledge) and 3.51 (Pedagogical Content Knowledge). Furthermore, according to the same study, teachers feel that they need further training in how to incorporate technology in their teaching as well as how to teach algorithms, two areas that relate to Pedagogical Content Knowledge and TPACK.","authors":["Spyros Doukakis","Christos Koilias","Nikos Adamopoulos","Panagiota Giannopoulou"],"meta":["January 2013Communications in Computer and Information Science 278:311-316","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-35879-1_36","Conference: World Summit on Knowledge Society"],"references":["284662881_Measuring_the_technological_pedagogical_content_knowledge_TPACK_of_in-service_teachers_of_computer_science_who_teach_algorithms_and_programming_in_upper_secondary_education","239918048_Technological_Pedagogical_Content_Knowledge_TPACK_The_Development_and_Validation_of_an_Assessment_Instrument_for_Preservice_Teachers","311471279_Toward_a_K-12_computer_science_curriculum","255568143_TPACK_Development_in_Science_Teaching_Measuring_the_TPACK_Confidence_of_Inservice_Science_Teachers","242473344_Knowledge_and_Teaching_Foundations_of_the_New_Reform","234652091_A_New_K-12_Computer_Science_Curriculum","220041541_Technological_Pedagogical_Content_Knowledge_A_Framework_for_Teacher_Knowledge"]}
