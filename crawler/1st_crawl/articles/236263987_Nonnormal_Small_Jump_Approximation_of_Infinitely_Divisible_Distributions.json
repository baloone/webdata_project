{"id":"236263987_Nonnormal_Small_Jump_Approximation_of_Infinitely_Divisible_Distributions","abstract":"We consider a type of nonnormal approximation of infinitely divisible\ndistributions that incorporates compound Poisson, Gamma, and normal\ndistributions. The approximation relies on achieving higher orders of cumulant\nmatching, to obtain higher rates of approximation error decay. The parameters\nof the approximation are easy to fix. The computational complexity of random\nsampling of the approximating distribution in many cases is of the same order\nas normal approximation. Error bounds in terms of total variance distance are\nderived. Both the univariate and the multivariate cases of the approximation\nare considered.","authors":["Zhiyi Chi"],"meta":["April 2013Advances in Applied Probability 46(4)","DOI:10.1239/aap/1418396239","SourcearXiv"],"references":["305973409_Approximations_of_small_jumps_of_Levy_processes_with_a_view_towards_simulation","324286691_An_Introduction_to_the_Theory_of_Point_Processes","316807045_Non-Uniform_Random_Variate_Generation","316800804_Classical_Fourier_Analysis","305973759_On_Approximations_of_Small_Jumps_of_Subordinators_with_Particular_Emphasis_on_a_Dickman-Type_Limit","289904058_Three_general_approaches_to_Stein's_method","284538608_Probability_Theory_Independence_Interchangeability_Martingales","283970310_On_the_rate_of_convergence_in_the_multivariate_CLT","279346984_Introduction_to_the_General_Theory_of_Point_Processes","271512856_Normal_Approximation_and_Asymptotic_Expansions"]}
