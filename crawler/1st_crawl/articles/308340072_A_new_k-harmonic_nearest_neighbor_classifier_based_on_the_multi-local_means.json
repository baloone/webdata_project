{"id":"308340072_A_new_k-harmonic_nearest_neighbor_classifier_based_on_the_multi-local_means","abstract":"The k-nearest neighbor (KNN) rule is a classical and yet very effective nonparametric technique in pattern classification, but its classification performance severely relies on the outliers. The local mean-based k-nearest neighbor classifier (LMKNN) was firstly introduced to achieve robustness against outliers by computing the local mean vector of k nearest neighbors for each class. However, its performances suffer from the choice of the single value of k for each class and the uniform value of k for different classes. In this paper, we propose a new KNN-based classifier, called multi-local means-based k-harmonic nearest neighbor (MLM-KHNN) rule. In our method, the k nearest neighbors in each class are first found, and then used to compute k different local mean vectors, which are employed to compute their harmonic mean distance to the query sample. Finally, MLM-KHNN proceeds in classifying the query sample to the class with the minimum harmonic mean distance. The experimental results, based on twenty real-world datasets from UCI and KEEL repository, demonstrated that the proposed MLM-KHNN classifier achieves lower classification error rate and is less sensitive to the parameter k, when compared to nine related competitive KNN-based classifiers, especially in small training sample size situations.","authors":["Zhibin Pan","Yidi Wang","Weiping Ku"],"meta":["September 2016Expert Systems with Applications 67","DOI:10.1016/j.eswa.2016.09.031"],"references":["304245971_Discovery_of_medical_Big_Data_analytics_Improving_the_prediction_of_traumatic_brain_injury_survival_rates_by_data_mining_Patient_Informatics_Processing_Software_Hybrid_Hadoop_Hive","280158118_A_Probabilistic_Framework_for_Dynamic_k_Estimation_in_kNN_Classifiers_with_Certainty_Factor","277280582_Plate-Tectonic_Evolution_of_the_Deep_Ocean_Basins_Adjoining_the_Western_Continental_Margin_of_India-A_Proposed_Model_for_the_Early_Opening_Scenario","263932980_In_vivo_and_in_vitro_evaluation_of_the_cytotoxic_effects_of_Photosan-loaded_hollow_silica_nanoparticles_on_liver_cancer","262735448_Fuzzy-belief_K-nearest_neighbor_classifier_for_uncertain_data","220320387_Distance_Metric_Learning_for_Large_Margin_Nearest_Neighbor_Classification","289345972_Nearest_neighbour_classification_based_on_local_mean_and_class_mean","288855597_A_Proposal_for_Local_k_Values_for_k-Nearest_Neighbor_Rule","283202571_An_evolutionary_voting_for_k-nearest_neighbours","282707871_Nearest_Neighbor_Pattern_Classification","279456512_Hybrid_k-Nearest_Neighbor_Classifier","278794839_A_Nearest_Neighbor_Classifier_Employing_Critical_Boundary_Vectors_for_Efficient_On-Chip_Template_Reduction","272825856_KEEL_Data-Mining_Software_Tool_Data_Set_Repository_Integration_of_Algorithms_and_Experimental_Analysis_Framework","270294119_Nearest_neighbor_classification_of_categorical_data_by_attributes_weighting","266320558_Improved_pseudo_nearest_neighbor_classification","265400697_A_Note_on_Distance-Weighted_k-Nearest_Neighbor_Rules","264241489_A_new_nearest_neighbor_classifier_via_fusing_neighborhood_information","262270854_A_fuzzy_nearest_neighbor_neural_network_statistical_model_for_predicting_demand_for_natural_gas_and_energy_cost_savings_in_public_buildings","257014964_Coarse_to_fine_K_nearest_neighbor_classifier","257014932_Component-based_global_k-NN_classifier_for_small_sample_size_problems","256991690_Noisy_data_elimination_using_mutual_k-nearest_neighbor_for_classification_mining","256822739_Local_discriminative_distance_metrics_ensemble_learning","256822279_A_new_belief-based_K-nearest_neighbor_classification_method","244956382_A_Fuzzy_K-Nearest_Neighbor_Algorithm","232406523_An_Improved_k-Nearest_Neighbor_Algorithm_for_Text_Categorization","228532864_Neighborhood_size_selection_in_the_k-nearest-neighbor_rule_using_statistical_confidence","224112437_The_Distance-Weighted_k-Nearest-Neighbor_Rule","223371990_A_local_mean-based_nonparametric_classifier","223263547_Fuzzy-rough_nearest_neighbor_algorithm_in_classification","222434248_Neighborhood_classifiers","222361415_Nearest_neighbour_group-based_classification","220547629_KEEL_Data-Mining_Software_Tool_Data_Set_Repository_Integration_of_Algorithms_and_Experimental_Analysis_Framework","220219764_Nonparametric_classification_based_on_local_mean_and_class_statistics","220219379_Pseudo_Nearest_Neighbor_Rule_for_Pattern_Classification","5582153_The_Nearest_Neighbor_Algorithm_of_Local_Probability_Centers","3082436_Bibliography_on_Estimation_of_Misclassification_IEEE_Tr_Info_Theory_20472-479","3081896_Convergence_of_the_Nearest_Neighbor_Rule","3081159_Nearest_neighbor_pattern_classification_IEEE_Trans_Inf_Theory_IT-13121-27"]}
