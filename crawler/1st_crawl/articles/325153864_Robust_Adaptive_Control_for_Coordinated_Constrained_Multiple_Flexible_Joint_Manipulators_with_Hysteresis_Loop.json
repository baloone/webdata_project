{"id":"325153864_Robust_Adaptive_Control_for_Coordinated_Constrained_Multiple_Flexible_Joint_Manipulators_with_Hysteresis_Loop","abstract":"This paper focuses on the position/force tracking control problem for constrained multiple flexible joint manipulators system with nonlinear input of hysteresis loop. Firstly, the dynamic model is given in the task space and the input of hysteresis loop model is approximated by a differential equation. Secondly, considering the disturbance with unknown bounds, a robust adaptive control strategy based on the sliding mode which consists of constraint force error and position error is designed. The proposed approach can not only compensate the model error, external disturbance, and flexible parameter uncertainties, but also drive the closed-loop system variables to reach the sliding model surface. Then it can be proved that both position and constraint force errors can be guaranteed to converge to zero. Finally, the simulation results can verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.","authors":["Li Shurong","Zhulong Shao","Pandeng Xu","Huaiqiang Yin"],"meta":["May 2018Mathematical Problems in Engineering 2018(2):1-9","DOI:10.1155/2018/2507637"],"references":["241360897_Master-Slave_synchronization_of_robot_manipulators_experimental_results","308500873_Sliding_mode_positionforce_control_for_motion_synchronization_of_a_flexible-joint_manipulator_system_with_time_delay","308499647_Finite-time_adaptive_fuzzy_positionforce_control_for_time-varying_constrained_coordinated_multiple_manipulators","306115664_Adaptive_positionforce_control_of_coordinated_multiple_manipulators_based_on_a_new_sliding_mode","286724320_Neural_network_based_adaptive_dynamic_surface_control_for_flexible-joint_robots","282683628_Adaptive_motionforce_control_for_rigid-link_flexible-joint_manipulators_with_time_delay","280175992_Task-Oriented_Control_of_Single-Master_Multi-Slave_Manipulator_System","271998994_Flexible_Manipulator_Control_Based_on_Singular_Perturbation_Theory_Study","256492628_Master-Slave_Synchronization_of_Robot_Manipulators","239787947_Robust_tracking_control_for_a_class_of_electrically_driven_flexible-joint_robots_without_velocity_measurements"]}
