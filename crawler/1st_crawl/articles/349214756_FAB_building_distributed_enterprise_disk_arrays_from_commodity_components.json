{"id":"349214756_FAB_building_distributed_enterprise_disk_arrays_from_commodity_components","abstract":"This paper describes the design, implementation, and evaluation of a Federated Array of Bricks (FAB), a distributed disk array that provides the reliability of traditional enterprise arrays with lower cost and better scalability. FAB is built from a collection of bricks , small storage appliances containing commodity disks, CPU, NVRAM, and network interface cards. FAB deploys a new majority-voting-based algorithm to replicate or erasure-code logical blocks across bricks and a reconfiguration algorithm to move data in the background when bricks are added or decommissioned. We argue that voting is practical and necessary for reliable, high-throughput storage systems such as FAB. We have implemented a FAB prototype on a 22-node Linux cluster. This prototype sustains 85MB/second of throughput for a database workload, and 270MB/second for a bulk-read workload. In addition, it can outperform traditional master-slave replication through performance decoupling and can handle brick failures and recoveries smoothly without disturbing client requests.","authors":["Yasushi Saito","Svend Fr√∏lund","Alistair Veitch","Arif Merchant"],"meta":["December 2004ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News 32(5):48-58","DOI:10.1145/1037947.1024400"],"references":["220938690_A_Cost-Effective_High-Bandwidth_Storage_Architecture","220439429_Efficient_At-Most-Once_Messages_Based_on_Synchronized_Clocks","200030482_Quorum_Systems_in_Replicated_Databases_Science_or_Fiction","200030230_Linearizability_A_Correctness_Condition_for_Concurrent_Objects","2516651_RAID_High-Performance_Reliable_Secondary_Storage","2337151_Dynamic_Voting_for_Consistent_Primary_Components","269078909_Improved_Algorithms_for_Synchronizing_Computer_Network_Clocks","220939059_Petal_Distributed_Virtual_Disks","200031985_Viewstamped_Replication_A_New_Primary_Copy_Method_to_Support_Highly-Available_Distributed_Systems","2626811_The_Part-Time_Parliament","2559570_Weighted_Voting_for_Replicated_Data"]}
