{"id":"276418286_Problem_MetaHeuristic_Solver_An_Educational_Tool_Aimed_at_Studying_Heuristic_Optimization_Methods","abstract":"In this paper, we introduce Problem MetaHeuristic Solver (PMHS), a new educational software tool aimed at the generic study of the concepts related to the optimization field. Its relevance in this environment arises from the performed coverage of the main stages when solving optimization problems. Its modular architecture, graphical functionalities, interaction level, and wide flexibility give rise to its educational interest, allowing its adaptation to multitude of educational environments, being an assistant during the theoretical lectures as well as a transversal tool over the practical sessions. PMHS has been used during an undergraduate optimization course. The results obtained from the experience suggest that the tool improves the understanding of the theoretical concepts and reduces the workload of the students when implementing optimization methods. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
