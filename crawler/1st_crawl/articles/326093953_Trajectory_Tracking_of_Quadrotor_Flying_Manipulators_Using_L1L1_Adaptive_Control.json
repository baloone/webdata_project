{"id":"326093953_Trajectory_Tracking_of_Quadrotor_Flying_Manipulators_Using_L1L1_Adaptive_Control","abstract":"This paper concerns with tracking control of an unmanned quadrotor vehicle equipped with a multi-link robotic manipulator. We present an analytic model of the system that formulates unknown interactions between the aerial platform and the manipulator in the form of nonlinear time-varying uncertainties. Based on the proposed model, a novel trajectory tracking scheme is synthesized by combining two inner feedback linearization loops to stabilize the nominal quadrotor and manipulator dynamics and a master L1 adaptive loop to systematically compensate for uncertainties and realize the desired closed-loop behavior. We show that this scheme leverages predictable transient and steady state performance in the presence of coupling effects and given a specified reference trajectory. Simulation studies have shown the effectiveness of the proposed aerial manipulator control method.","authors":["Hossein Beikzadeh","Guangjun Liu"],"meta":["June 2018Journal of the Franklin Institute 355(14)","DOI:10.1016/j.jfranklin.2018.06.011"],"references":[]}
