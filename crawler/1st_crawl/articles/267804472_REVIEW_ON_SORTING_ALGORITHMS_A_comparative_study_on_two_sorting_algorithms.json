{"id":"267804472_REVIEW_ON_SORTING_ALGORITHMS_A_comparative_study_on_two_sorting_algorithms","abstract":"Any number of practical applications in computing requires things to be in order. The performance of any computation depends upon the performance of sorting algorithms. Like all complicated problems, there are many solutions that can achieve the same results. One sort algorithm can do sorting of data faster than another. A lot of sorting algorithms has been developed to enhance the performance in terms of computational complexity, memory and other factors. This paper choose two of the sorting algorithms among them selection sort and shell sort and compares the various performance factor among them.","authors":["Pooja Adhikari"],"meta":[],"references":["220688589_Introduction_to_Algorithms_Second_Edition"]}
