{"id":"334004118_A_Meetei_Mayek_Basic_Characters_Recognizer_Using_Deep_Features","abstract":"This paper presents a Meetei Mayek Isolated Handwritten Basic Character Recognition System (MMIHBCRS) which is a part of an undergoing development of a full-fledged Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system for Meetei Mayek script. In this work, we have developed a standard Meetei Mayek Isolated Handwritten Basic Character Database consisting of 8000 plus characters. The proposed work has used the concept of Transfer Learning where a pretrained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has been used for Deep Convolutional Features extraction. The performance of two classifiers K-Nearest Neighbour (K-NN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are compared using the extracted Deep Features. Using the Deep Features, the classifiers have achieved very high recognition accuracies for a dataset of 8000 characters where SVM has shown better recognition accuracy compared to K-NN giving an accuracy of 97.55% compared to K-NNâ€™s 96.63%.","authors":["Neeta Chingakham","Debaprasad Das","Mamata Devi Haobam"],"meta":["June 2019","DOI:10.1007/978-981-13-8581-0_25","In book: Computational Intelligence, Communications, and Business Analytics (pp.306-315)"],"references":["222834590_Handwritten_digit_recognition_Benchmarking_of_state-of-the-art_techniques","220405528_Recognition_of_Handwritten_Character_of_Manipuri_Script","272524453_Handwritten_Bangla_character_recognition_using_a_soft_computing_paradigm_embedded_in_two_pass_approach","256822407_Arabic_handwriting_recognition_using_structural_and_syntactic_pattern_attributes","223655087_Recognition_of_handwritten_Chinese_characters_by_critical_region_analysis","222865785_Gujarati_handwritten_numeral_optical_character_reorganization_through_neural_network","23791817_Handwritten_Numeral_Databases_of_Indian_Scripts_and_Multistage_Recognition_of_Mixed_Numerals","3766290_Bilateral_Filtering_for_Gray_and_Color_Images"]}
