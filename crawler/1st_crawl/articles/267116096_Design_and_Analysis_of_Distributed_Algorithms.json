{"id":"267116096_Design_and_Analysis_of_Distributed_Algorithms","abstract":"This text is based on a simple and fully reactive computational model that allows for intuitive comprehension and logical designs. The principles and techniques presented can be applied to any distributed computing environment (e.g., distributed systems, communication networks, data networks, grid networks, internet, etc.). The text provides a wealth of unique material for learning how to design algorithms and protocols perform tasks efficiently in a distributed computing environment.","authors":["Nicola Santoro"],"meta":["April 2006","DOI:10.1002/0470072644","Project: Distributed algorithms"],"references":["234816878_Distributed_Algorithms_for_Finding_Centers_and_Medians_in_Networks","234782243_Lower_Bounds_for_Distributed_Maximum-Finding_Algorithms","230800870_Interval_Routing_Schemes","225905839_An_improved_upperbound_for_distributed_election_in_bidirectional_rings_of_processors","225814666_Swapping_a_Failing_Edge_of_a_Single_Source_Shortest_Paths_Tree_Is_Good_and_Fast","220618850_Formal_Theories_of_Knowledge_in_AI_and_Robotics","284252334_On_the_complexity_of_distributed_elections_in_synchronous_graphs","268829580_Distributed_algorithms_for_ranking_the_nodes_of_a_network","262280706_The_Compactness_of_Interval_Routing","256181948_Bit-Optimal_Election_in_Synchronous_Rings","242914311_On_an_improved_algorithm_for_finding_the_median_distributively_1","242361715_Common_knowledge_and_related_puzzles","234812335_Election_in_a_complete_network_with_a_sense_of_direction","234806571_Optimal_distributed_algorithms_for_minimum_weight_spanning_tree_counting_leader_election_and_related_problems","233021045_An_improved_election_algorithm_in_chordal_ring_networks","232644613_Election_in_Asynchronous_Complete_Networks_with_Intermittent_Link_Failures","229709643_Reducing_complexities_of_the_distributed_max-flow_and_breadth-first-search_algorithms_by_means_of_network_synchronization","229696832_Construction_of_centered_shortest-path_trees_in_networks","229491568_Shout_echo_selection_in_distributed_files","226887472_Distributed_election_in_complete_networks","226029398_A_class_of_deadlock-free_Maekawa-type_algorithms_for_mutual_exclusion_in_distributed_systems","225541612_The_Bit_Complexity_of_Distributed_Sorting","225369961_Fast_consensus_in_networks_of_bounded_degree","225267085_Electing_a_leader_in_a_ring_with_link_failures","224483364_Optimal_Distributed_Algorithms_for_Sorting_and_Ranking","224483363_Distributed_Sorting","223149515_Broadcasting_in_hypercubes_when_calls_fail","223124525_On_timeout_for_global_deadlock_detection_in_decentralized_database_systems","223113581_Termination_detection_by_using_distributed_snapshots","223048104_On_finding_and_updating_shortest_paths_distributively","222800202_Sorting_a_distributed_file_in_a_network","222596590_The_complexity_of_sorting_on_distributed_systems","222472708_Some_Lower_Bound_Results_for_Decentralized_Extrema-Finding_in_Rings_of_Processors","222470516_Exact_average_message_complexity_values_for_distributed_election_on_bidirectional_rings_of_processors","222456374_A_better_lower_bound_for_distributed_leader_finding_in_bidirectional_asynchronous_rings_of_processors","222453726_A_Distributed_Solution_of_the_Distributed_Termination_Problem","222452690_Termination_detection_for_distributed_computations","222448470_The_derivation_of_graph_marking_algorithms_from_distributed_termination_detection_protocols","222441894_An_On_log_n_Unidirectional_Distributed_Algorithm_for_Extrema_Finding_in_a_Circle","222384658_On_the_expected_complexity_of_distributed_selection","222371683_Worst_Case_Bounds_for_Shortest_Path_Interval_Routing","222058778_Distributed_sorting_algorithms_for_multi-channel_broadcast_networks","221344307_Detecting_Termination_of_Distributed_Computation_Using_Markers","221343758_Leader_Election_in_Complete_Networks","221039027_Distributed_Function_Evaluation_in_the_Presence_of_Transmission_Faults","220623485_Efficient_Solutions_to_the_Replicated_Log_and_Dictionary_Problems","220618234_Improving_the_Time_Complexity_of_Message-Optimal_Distributed_Algorithms_for_Minimum-Weight_Spanning_Trees","220574422_Finding_the_Median_Distributively","220573656_Distributed_Algorithms_for_Selection_in_Sets","220573456_Low_Complexity_Variants_of_the_Arrow_Distributed_Directory","220567064_One-Bit_Algorithms","220569672_Tight_Bounds_for_Synchronous_Communication_of_Information_Using_Bits_Silence","220567106_Optimal_Asynchronous_Agreement_and_Leader_Election_Algorithm_for_Complete_Networks_with_Byzantine_Faulty_Links","220566952_Mutual_Exclusion_in_Partitioned_Distributed_Systems","220566901_Connectivity_Requirements_for_Byzantine_Agreement_under_Restricted_Types_of_Failures"]}
