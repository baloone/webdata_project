The results\nof this study are expected to provide an overview to prospective foreign investors who\nare interested in investing in Indonesia public companies which related to\norganizational behavior and governance style. However, there was less company that\nreported sustainability reporting continuously from 2007 up to 2016. This becomes a\nspecial and interesting concern to be investigated as the awareness phenomenon for\nthe industries in Indonesia. With specified criteria found 60 observation data for 10\nyears and used multiple linear regression. The result showed that Government Control\nand Audit Control affected the implementation of Sustainability Reporting while the\nInternal control and shareholder control had no effect. The special note for\nshareholder control had a negative coefficient and it became a phenomenon for future\nresearch. Another finding was that the implementation of Sustainability Reporting and\nGovernment Control had an effect on good corporate governance.","authors":["Yulita Setiawanta","Purwanto Agus"],"meta":["August 2019"],"references":[]}
