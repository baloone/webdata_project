{"id":"226386991_Random_walks_and_the_effective_resistance_of_networks","abstract":"In this article we present an interpretation ofeffective resistance in electrical networks in terms of random walks on underlying graphs. Using this characterization we provide simple and elegant proofs for some known results in random walks and electrical networks. We also interpret the Reciprocity theorem of electrical networks in terms of traversals in random walks. The byproducts are (a) precise version of thetriangle inequality for effective resistances, and (b) an exact formula for the expectedone-way transit time between vertices.","authors":["Prasad Tetali"],"meta":["January 1991Journal of Theoretical Probability 4(1):101-109","DOI:10.1007/BF01046996"],"references":["227140153_The_Electrical_Resistance_Of_A_Graph_Captures_Its_Commute_And_Cover_Times","344774923_Random_Walks_and_Electric_Networks","313565837_Random_Walks_and_Electric_Networks","267177669_Denumerable_Markov_Chains","265889871_The_average_impedance_of_an_electrical_network","239061426_Basic_Engineering_Circuit_Analysis","222511955_Random_walks_on_graphs","50335362_Denumerable_Markov_chains"]}
