{"id":"323726922_Feasibility_Analysis_for_Creating_a_Metrology_Laboratory_Serving_the_Agribusiness_and_Hydrocarbons_in_the_Department_of_Huila_Colombia","abstract":"The metrological tools have significantly helped in the production processes of each sector in all industries of the country. In the areas of analysis this feature becomes important because of the diversity of equipment and measuring instruments for evaluating and calibrating aspects that the project can be identified through market studies, technical and financial resources in accordance with the specific needs of a metrology laboratory that serves the hydrocarbon industry and agribusiness in the department of Huila. The impact of creating a metrology laboratory for these sectors is reflected in the provision of calibration services to potentially 762 companies in which they also significantly reduce the costs of sending their teams to other cities, the corresponding time management and mismatches because of the distances they have to travel.","authors":["Ruthber Rodriguez","Nestor Alonso Pach√≥n Pedraza","Jorge Ivan Perdomo"],"meta":["March 2018International Journal of Applied Engineering Research 13(6)","Projects: Feasibility Analysis for Creating a Metrology Laboratory Serving the Agribusiness and Hydrocarbons in the Department of Huila, ColombiaProduction control"],"references":["324091535_Electrogenic_Biodegradation_Study_of_the_Carbofuran_Insecticide_in_Soil","322926365_Extraction_in_Laboratory_of_Heavy_Metals_Through_Rhizofiltration_using_the_Plant_Zea_Mays_maize","322687430_A_consistent_methodology_for_the_development_of_inverse_and_direct_kinematics_of_robust_industrial_robots","322594033_Dental_Caries_Social_Problem_in_School_Children_Aged_5-14_Years_from_Formal_Educational_Institutions_in_Huila_Colombia","322526369_Real_Process_Characteristic_Capacity_Weight_in_the_Product_500_Grams_in_a_Rice_Mill","321913209_Design_of_a_gas_sensor_based_on_the_concept_of_digital_interconnection_IoT_for_the_emergency_broadcast_system","321913089_Case_Study_of_Energy_Management_Model_in_the_Threshing_System_for_the_Production_of_White_Rice","321743256_Generation_and_Control_of_Basic_Geometric_Trajectories_for_a_Robot_Manipulator_Using_CompactRIOR","316663156_Design_and_implementation_of_a_pid_fuzzy_control_for_the_speed_of_a_DC_motor","314205186_Applied_Mathematics_and_Demonstrations_to_the_Theory_of_Optimal_Filters"]}
