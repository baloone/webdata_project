{"id":"220337141_Cryptanalysis_of_White-Box_DES_Implementations_with_Arbitrary_External_Encodings","abstract":"At DRM 2002, Chow et al. (4) presented a method for im- plementing the DES block cipher such that it becomes hard to extract the embedded secret key in a white-box attack context. In such a con- text, an attacker has full access to the implementation and its execution environment. In order to provide an extra level of security, an implemen- tation shielded with external encodings was introduced by Chow et al. and improved by Link and Neumann (10). In this paper, we present an algorithm to extract the secret key from such white-box DES implemen- tations. The cryptanalysis is a difierential attack on obfuscated rounds, and works regardless of the shielding external encodings that are applied. The cryptanalysis has a average time complexity of 214 and a negligible space complexity.","authors":["Brecht Wyseur","Wil Michiels","Paul Gorissen","Bart Preneel"],"meta":["August 2007","DOI:10.1007/978-3-540-77360-3_17","SourceDBLP","Conference: Selected Areas in Cryptography, 14th International Workshop, SAC 2007, Ottawa, Canada, August 16-17, 2007, Revised Selected Papers"],"references":["225241894_Cryptanalysis_of_a_White_Box_AES_Implementation","221609662_A_white-box_DES_implementation_for_DRM_applications","221274772_Cryptanalysis_of_White_Box_DES_Implementations","221274739_White-Box_Cryptography_and_an_AES_Implementation","220942527_Related-key_rectangle_attacks_on_reduced_AES-192_and_AES-256","243581144_Security_in_computing_2nd_ed","228874485_Cache_Attacks_and_Countermeasures_The_Case_of_AES","228555641_A_cautionary_note_on_weak_implementations_of_block_ciphers","225132251_Differential_Cryptanalysis_of_Snefru_Khafre_REDOC-II_LOKI_and_Lucifer","224103472_The_Data_Encryption_Standard_DES_and_its_strength_against_attacks","221630417_Clarifying_Obfuscation_Improving_the_Security_of_White-Box_DES","221208215_Cache_Attacks_and_Countermeasures_The_Case_of_AES","2559354_Attacking_an_Obfuscated_Cipher_By_Injecting_Faults"]}
