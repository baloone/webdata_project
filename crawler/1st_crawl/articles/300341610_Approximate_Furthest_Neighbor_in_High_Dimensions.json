{"id":"300341610_Approximate_Furthest_Neighbor_in_High_Dimensions","abstract":"Much recent work has been devoted to approximate nearest neighbor queries. Motivated by applications in recommender systems, we consider approximate furthest neighbor (AFN) queries. We present a simple, fast, and highly practical data structure for answering AFN queries in high-dimensional Euclidean space. We build on the technique of Indyk (SODA 2003), storing random projections to provide sublinear query time for AFN. However, we introduce a different query algorithm, improving on Indykâ€™s approximation factor and reducing the running time by a logarithmic factor. We also present a variation based on a query-independent ordering of the database points; while this does not have the provable approximation factor of the query-dependent data structure, it offers significant improvement in time and space complexity. We give a theoretical analysis, and experimental results.","authors":["Rasmus Pagh","Francesco Silvestri","Johan Sivertsen","Matthew Skala"],"meta":["October 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-25087-8_1","Conference: International Conference on Similarity Search and Applications"],"references":["262240658_Real-Time_Recommendation_of_Diverse_Related_Articles","241677887_Increasing_Diversity_Through_Furthest_Neighbor-Based_Recommendation","225534605_A_New_Algorithm_for_Optimal_Constraint_Satisfaction_and_Its_Implications","1961276_Approximate_Graph_Coloring_by_Semidefinite_Programming","266657758_Composable_core-sets_for_diversity_and_coverage_maximization","259389412_Computational_Geometry_Algorithms_And_Applications","246795749_Measuring_the_dimensionality_of_metric_spaces","241677884_User-Centric_Evaluation_of_a_K-Furthest_Neighbor_Collaborative_FilteringRecommender_Algorithm","238711009_Aspects_of_Metric_Spaces_in_Computation","227619265_On_variants_of_the_Johnson-Lindenstrauss_lemma","226714951_A_Subexponential_Bound_for_Linear_Programming","220991597_Dynamic_Algorithms_for_Approximate_Neighbor_Searching","220780590_Better_algorithms_for_high-dimensional_proximity_problems_via_asymmetric_embeddings","220639820_Approximate_minimum_enclosing_balls_in_high_dimensions_using_core-sets","220556636_Optimal_core-sets_for_balls","215458558_Locality-sensitive_hashing_scheme_based_on_p-stable_distributions","46620331_Computational_Geometry_Algorithms_and_Applications","2784691_Las_Vegas_Algorithms_for_Linear_and_Integer_Programming_When_the_Dimension_is_Small","2430661_Reductions_Among_High_Dimensional_Proximity_Problems"]}
