{"id":"255994548_The_Hospitals_Residents_Problem_with_Couples_Complexity_and_Integer_Programming_Models","abstract":"The Hospitals / Residents problem with Couples (HRC) is a generalisation of\nthe classical Hospitals / Resident problem (HR) that is important in practical\napplications because it models the case where couples submit joint preference\nlists over pairs of (typically geographically close) hospitals. In this paper\nwe give a new NP-completeness result for the problem of deciding whether a\nstable matching exists, in highly restricted instances of HRC. Further, we\npresent an Integer Programming (IP) model for HRC and extend it the case where\npreference lists can include ties. Also, we describe an empirical study of an\nIP model or HRC and its extension to the case where preference lists can\ninclude ties. This model was applied to randomly generated instances and also\nreal-world instances arising from previous matching runs of the Scottish\nFoundation Allocation Scheme, used to allocate junior doctors to hospitals in\nScotland.","authors":["Iain McBride","David Manlove"],"meta":["August 2013","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-07959-2_2","SourcearXiv","Conference: International Symposium on Experimental Algorithms"],"references":["237834167_Student_Admissions_in_Hungary_as_Gale_and_Shapley_Envisaged","237138137_Matching_with_Couples_a_Multidisciplinary_Survey","221428778_Almost_Stable_Matchings_in_the_Roommates_Problem","220639842_Stable_matching_with_couples_An_empirical_study","323715811_College_Admissions_and_the_Stability_of_Marriage","311344193_College_Admission_and_the_Stability_of_Marriage","268023965_Algorithmics_of_matching_under_preferences_With_a_foreword_by_Kurt_Mehlhorn","246774035_Matching_medical_students_to_pairs_of_hospitals_A_new_variation_on_an_old_theme","242913745_Three-Dimensional_Stabl_Matching_Problems","228108281_The_Effects_of_the_Change_in_the_NRMP_Matching_Algorithm","228108175_College_Admissions_and_Stability_of_Marriage","225203624_Keeping_partners_together_Algorithmic_results_for_the_hospitalsresidents_problem_with_couples","223141847_Some_remarks_on_the_stable_matching_problem","222770339_Stable_matchings_with_couples","222448794_NP-complete_stable_matching_problems","220789943_Stable_Marriage_with_Ties_and_Bounded_Length_Preference_Lists","220770550_Matching_Medical_Students_to_Pairs_of_Hospitals_A_New_Variation_on_a_Well-Known_Theme","220690083_The_Stable_Marriage_Problem_Structure_and_Algorithms","220616740_Lower_Bounds_for_the_Stable_Marriage_Problem_and_Its_Variants","220138445_Approximation_Hardness_of_Short_Symmetric_Instances_of_MAX-3SAT","47719746_Matching_with_Couples_Revisited","20880864_New_Physicians_A_Natural_Experiment_in_Market_Organization","4895481_On_the_Allocation_of_Residents_to_Rural_Hospitals_A_General_Property_of_Two-Sided_Matching_Markets","2631118_The_Evolution_of_the_Labor_Market_for_Medical_Interns_and_Residents_A_Case_Study_in_Game_Theory"]}
