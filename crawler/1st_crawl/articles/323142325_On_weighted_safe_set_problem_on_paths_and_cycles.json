{"id":"323142325_On_weighted_safe_set_problem_on_paths_and_cycles","abstract":"Let $G$ be a graph, and let $w: V(G) \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be a weight function on the vertices of $G$. For every subset $X$ of $V(G)$, let $w(X)=\\sum_{v \\in X} w(v).$ A non-empty subset $S \\subset V(G)$ is a weighted safe set of $(G,w)$ if, for every component $C$ of the subgraph induced by $S$ and every component $D$ of $G-S$, we have $w(C) \\geq w(D)$ whenever there is an edge between $C$ and $D$. If the subgraph of $G$ induced by a weighted safe set $S$ is connected, then the set $S$ is called a connected weighted safe set of $(G,w)$. The weighted safe number $s(G,w)$ and connected weighted safe number $cs(G,w)$ of $(G,w)$ are the minimum weights $w(S)$ among all weighted safe sets and all connected weighted safe sets of $(G,w)$, respectively. It is easy to see that for any pair $(G,w)$, ${s}(G,w) \\le {cs}(G,w)$ by their definitions. In this paper, we discuss the possible equality when $G$ is a path or a cycle. We also give an answer to a problem due to Tittmann et al. [Eur. J. Combin. Vol. 32 (2011)] concerning subgraph component polynomials for cycles and complete graphs.","authors":["Shinya Fujita","Tommy Jensen","Boram Park","Tadashi Sakuma"],"meta":["February 2019Journal of Combinatorial Optimization 37(2)","DOI:10.1007/s10878-018-0316-4"],"references":["321417761_Approximating_Connected_Safe_Sets_in_Weighted_Trees","321141245_Safe_sets_in_graphs_Graph_classes_and_structural_parameters","321104529_Safe_sets_network_majority_on_weighted_trees","306026349_Safe_set_problem_on_graphs","266528823_Graphs_digraphs_5th_ed","230873084_Combinatorial_Optimization","23678714_The_Enumeration_of_Vertex_Induced_Subgraphs_with_respect_to_the_Number_of_Components"]}
