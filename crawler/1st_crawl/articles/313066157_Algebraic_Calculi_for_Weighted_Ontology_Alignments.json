{"id":"313066157_Algebraic_Calculi_for_Weighted_Ontology_Alignments","abstract":"Alignments between ontologies usually come with numerical attributes expressing the confidence of each correspondence. Semantics supporting such confidences must generalise the semantics of alignments without confidence. There exists a semantics which satisfies this but introduces a discontinuity between weighted and non-weighted interpretations. Moreover, it does not provide a calculus for reasoning with weighted ontology alignments. This paper introduces a calculus for such alignments. It is given by an infinite relation-type algebra, the elements of which are weighted taxonomic relations. In addition, it approximates the non-weighted case in a continuous manner.","authors":["Armen Inants","Manuel Atencia","Jérôme Euzenat"],"meta":["October 2016Lecture Notes in Computer Science","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-46523-4_22","Conference: International Semantic Web Conference"],"references":["281472549_An_Algebra_of_Qualitative_Taxonomical_Relations_for_Ontology_Alignments","236985222_Algebraic_Properties_of_Qualitative_Spatio-Temporal_Calculi","230745455_The_Description_Logic_Handbook_Theory_Implementation_and_Applications","228870674_GQR_-_A_Fast_Reasoner_for_Binary_Qualitative_Constraint_Calculi","225136178_Three_Semantics_for_Distributed_Systems_and_Their_Relations_with_Alignment_Composition","221251335_SparQ_-_A_Spatial_Reasoning_Toolbox","319395635_The_Description_Logic_Handbook_Theory_Implementation_and_Applications","286023400_Ontology_matching_Second_edition","267139632_Introduction_to_Boolean_Algebras","262170176_A_Formal_Semantics_for_Weighted_Ontology_Mappings","257807142_Context-Based_Matching_Design_of_a_Flexible_Framework_and_Experiment","242921856_Encyclopedia_of_Mathematics_and_its_Applications","225644413_Distributed_Description_Logics_Assimilating_Information_from_Peer_Sources","221466243_Algebras_of_Ontology_Alignment_Relations","221419423_What_Is_a_Qualitative_Calculus_A_General_Framework","35172551_Constraint_satisfaction_with_infinite_domains","2433939_An_Algebraic_Approach_to_Granularity_in_Qualitative_Time_and_Space_Representation"]}
