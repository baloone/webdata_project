{"id":"275241225_3D_Self-Deployment_Algorithm_in_Mobile_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","abstract":"The sensor deployment problem of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is a key issue in the researches and the applications of WSNs. Fewer works focus on the 3D autonomous deployment. Aimed at the problem of sensor deployment in three-dimensional spaces, the 3D self-deployment (3DSD) algorithm in mobile sensor networks is proposed. A 3D virtual force model is utilized in the 3DSD method. A negotiation tactic is introduced to ensure network connectivity, and a density control strategy is used to balance the node distribution. The proposed algorithm can fulfill the nodes autonomous deployment in 3D space with obstacles. Simulation results indicate that the deployment process of 3DSD is relatively rapid and the nodes are well distributed. Furthermore, the coverage ratio of 3DSD approximates the theoretical maximum value.","authors":["Chunyu Miao","Guoyong Dai","Xiaomin Zhao","Zhongze Tang"],"meta":["April 2015International Journal of Distributed Sensor Networks 2015(4):1-11","DOI:10.1155/2015/721921"],"references":["258394639_A_Node_Deployment_Algorithm_Based_on_Van_Der_Waals_Force_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","258384172_An_Extended_Virtual_Force-Based_Approach_to_Distributed_Self-Deployment_in_Mobile_Sensor_Networks","292061228_An_energy_efficient_three-dimensional_coverage_control_algorithm_for_wireless_sensor_networks","289389892_Sensor_Redeployment_Algorithm_Based_on_Combined_Virtual_Forces_in_Three_Dimensional_Space","266562807_Autonomous_deployment_of_sensors_for_maximized_coverage_and_guaranteed_connectivity_in_Underwater_Acoustic_Sensor_Networks","263749536_Analyzing_the_redeployment_problem_of_mobile_wireless_sensor_networks","263093969_Connectivity-Preserved_and_Force-Based_Deployment_Scheme_for_Mobile_Sensor_Network","261384031_Redeployment_of_Randomly_Deployed_Wireless_Mobile_Sensor_Nodes","260542077_Distributed_Deployment_Strategies_for_Improved_Coverage_in_a_Network_of_Mobile_Sensors_With_Prioritized_Sensing_Field","260514968_A_Mobility-Aware_Node_Deployment_and_Tree_Construction_Framework_for_ZigBee_Wireless_Networks"]}
