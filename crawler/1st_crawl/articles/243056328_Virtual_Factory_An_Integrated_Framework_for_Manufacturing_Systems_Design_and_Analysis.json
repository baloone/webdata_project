{"id":"243056328_Virtual_Factory_An_Integrated_Framework_for_Manufacturing_Systems_Design_and_Analysis","abstract":"Competitive manufacturing companies have to effectively deal with the concurrent evolution of products, processes and production systems. This problem, known as Co-evolution, can be addressed only through the integrated use of different methodologies, provided that the digital tools implementing these methodologies can interoperate properly and effectively. This paper presents the concept of an integrated framework to support the interoperability between digital factory tools and shows how it can benefit the business processes along the whole factory life-cycle.","authors":["Tullio.
