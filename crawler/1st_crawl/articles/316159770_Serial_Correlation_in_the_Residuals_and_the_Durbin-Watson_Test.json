{"id":"316159770_Serial_Correlation_in_the_Residuals_and_the_Durbin-Watson_Test","abstract":"This chapter opens with a discussion on serial correlation in residuals. In regression work, it is typically assumed that the observational errors are pairwise uncorrelated. There are many ways in which the errors may be correlated. A common way is that they may be serially correlated. If residuals exhibit local positive serial correlation, successive residuals in a time sequence tend to be more alike than otherwise, and a time plot of them will have the general characteristics of rising and falling but with close points more alike than otherwise. Negative serial correlation between successive residuals can also arise. One cause is a phenomenon known as carryover, which occurs in batch processes. A well-known way of checking for serial correlation patterns in an equally spaced sequence of residuals is via the Durbin-Watson test. The Runs test provides a quick but approximate alternative to the Durbin-Watson test.","authors":["Norman R.
