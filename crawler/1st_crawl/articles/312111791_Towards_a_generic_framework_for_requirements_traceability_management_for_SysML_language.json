{"id":"312111791_Towards_a_generic_framework_for_requirements_traceability_management_for_SysML_language","abstract":"Requirements traceability provides support to check that the final system meets stakeholders' requirements. Although the important role of requirements traceability is widely recognized, the application of traceability methods remains limited and varies from one development team to another. In this work, we aim at providing a common approach for requirements traceability in case of complex system development. A generic framework has been devised to manage requirement traceability along system development process. We propose a metamodel in order to define trace models and give a representation for all system artifacts and trace links. We have then included a Trace generation activity based on an algorithm to automate the trace models extraction. We use a Temperature Control System in order to apply our traceability framework.","authors":["Saida Haidrar","Adil Anwar","Ounsa Roudies"],"meta":["October 2016","DOI:10.1109/CIST.2016.7805044","Conference: 2016 4th IEEE International Colloquium on Information Science and Technology (CIST)","Project: Requirements analysis"],"references":["261038334_Model-based_traceability","239761124_Formalizing_traceability_relations_for_product_lines","237588107_The_MeMVaTEx_methodology_from_requirements_to_models_in_automotive_application_design","228948311_A_framework_for_requirements_traceability_in_UML_projects","224192985_A_Model_for_Requirements_Traceability_in_a_Heterogeneous_Model-Based_Design_Process_Application_to_Automotive_Embedded_Systems","37597544_Complex_System_Classification","3895371_A_Scenario-Driven_Approach_to_Traceability","2961853_Best_Practices_for_Automated_Traceability","265685449_The_Grand_Challenge_of_Traceability_v10","262348109_Traceability_and_SysML_design_slices_to_support_safety_inspections","234125583_A_Practical_Guide_to_SysML_the_Systems_Modeling_Language","220693866_Requirements_Engineering_Fundamentals_Principles_and_Techniques","3188133_Toward_Reference_Models_for_Requirements_Traceability"]}
