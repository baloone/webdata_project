{"id":"305385157_Online_Decorrelation_of_Humidity_and_Temperature_in_Chemical_Sensors_for_Continuous_Monitoring","abstract":"A method for online decorrelation of chemical sensor readings from the effects of environmental humidity and temperature variations is proposed. The goal is to improve the accuracy of electronic nose measurements for continuous monitoring by processing data from simultaneous readings of environmental humidity and temperature. The electronic nose setup built for this study included eight different metal-oxide sensors, temperature and humidity sensors with a wireless communication link to PC. This wireless electronic nose was used to monitor air for two years in the residence of one of the authors and collected data continuously during 510 full days with a sampling rate of 2 samples per second. To estimate the effects of variations in air humidity and temperature on the chemical sensors readings, we used a standard energy band model for an n-type metal-oxide sensor. The main assumption of the model is that variations in sensor conductivity can be expressed as a nonlinear function of changes in the semiconductor energy bands in the presence of external humidity and temperature variations. Fitting this model to the collected data, we confirmed that the most statistically significant factors are humidity changes and correlated changes of temperature and humidity. This simple model achieves excellent accuracy with $R^2$ performance close to 1. To show how the humidity-temperature correction model works for gas discrimination, we also collected 100 samples of wine and banana. The goal is to distinguish between wine, banana, and baseline. We show that pattern recognition algorithms improve performance and reliability by including the filtered signal of the chemical sensors.","authors":["Ram√≥n Huerta","Thiago S Mosqueiro","Jordi
