{"id":"323302115_Walking_in_a_Planar_Poisson-Delaunay_Triangulation_Shortcuts_in_the_Voronoi_Path","abstract":"Let Xn be a planar Poisson point process of intensity n. We give a new proof that the expected length of the Voronoi path between (0,0) and (1,0) in the Delaunay triangulation associated with Xn is 4π≃1.27 when n goes to infinity; and we also prove that the variance of this length is Θ(1/n). We investigate the length of possible shortcuts in this path, and define a shortened Voronoi path whose expected length can be expressed as an integral that is numerically evaluated to ≃1.16. The shortened Voronoi path has the property to be locally defined; and is shorter than the previously known locally defined paths in Delaunay triangulation such as the upper path whose expected length is 35/3π2≃1.18.","authors":["Olivier Devillers","Louis Noizet"],"meta":["September 2018International Journal of Computational Geometry & Applications 28(03)","DOI:10.1142/S0218195918500061"],"references":["313940474_Expected_Length_of_the_Voronoi_Path_in_a_High_Dimensional_Poisson-Delaunay_Triangulation","306225161_The_worst_visibility_walk_in_a_random_Delaunay_triangulation_is_O_n","260367226_Efficiently_Navigating_a_Random_Delaunay_Triangulation","38349346_Markov_Paths_on_the_Poisson-Delaunay_Graph_with_applications_to_routing_in_mobile_networks","2926287_Walking_in_a_Triangulation","322975726_Stretch_Factor_in_a_Planar_Poisson-Delaunay_Triangulation_with_a_Large_Intensity","265450418_Stochastic_an_Integral_Geometry","263905116_WALKING_IN_A_TRIANGULATION","222546692_Expected_time_analysis_for_Delaunay_point_location","220556368_On_the_stabbing_number_of_a_random_Delaunay_triangulation","2426605_Online_Routing_in_Triangulations"]}
