{"id":"303972246_Customizable_dynamic_user_interface_distribution","abstract":"This paper describes a solution for flexibly obtaining distributed user interfaces across multiple devices. To this end, we propose a model-based approach, with associated authoring environment, which allows designers and developers to specify how to distribute interfaces at various granularity levels, ranging from entire user interfaces to parts of single interactive elements, and obtain the corresponding implementations. This solution includes run-time support for keeping the resulting user interfaces synchronized and customization tools that allow end users to dynamically change how the user interface elements are distributed across multiple interactive devices in order to address unforeseen situations. We also report on a first user test and how the environment has evolved according to the user feedback.","authors":["Marco Manca","Fabio Patern√≤"],"meta":["June 2016","DOI:10.1145/2933242.2933259","Conference: the 8th ACM SIGCHI Symposium"],"references":["221568584_Multibrowsing_Moving_Web_Content_across_Multiple_Displays","221270276_Prototype_for_Using_Handheld_Devices_for_Mobile_Interaction_with_Displays_in_Home_Environments","221053763_Four_Easy_Pieces_for_Assessing_the_Usability_of_Multimodal_Interaction_The_Care_Properties","220728556_A_model-based_approach_for_distributed_user_interfaces","220286389_MARIA_A_universal_declarative_multiple_abstraction-level_language_for_service-oriented_applications_in_ubiquitous_environments","4011317_Portability_extensibility_and_robustness_in_iROS","295932466_MultiMasher_Providing_Architectural_Support_and_Visual_Tools_for_Multi-device_Mashups","289764714_User_interface_distribution_in_multi-device_and_multi-user_environments_with_dynamically_migrating_engines","283442971_Drag_Share_A_Shared_Workspace_for_Distributed_Synchronous_Collaboration","283442970_Drag_Share_A_Shared_Workspace_for_Distributed_Synchronous_Collaboration","281450045_Distributed_user_interfaces_Specification_of_essential_properties","266655563_Panelrama_Enabling_easy_specification_of_cross-device_web_applications","259142842_Model-based_dynamic_distribution_of_user_interfaces_of_critical_interactive_systems","230758009_The_Cost_of_Display_Switching_A_Comparison_of_Mobile_Large_Display_and_Hybrid_UI_Configurations","222424859_Using_handhelds_for_wireless_remote_control_of_PCs_and_appliances","221516427_It's_on_my_other_computer_Computing_with_multiple_devices","221052637_Dynamic_user_interface_distribution_for_flexible_multimodal_interaction","4207910_Distributed_User_Interface_Elements_to_support_Smart_Interaction_Spaces"]}
