{"id":"290037436_On_constructing_graphs_with_the_same_status_sequence","abstract":"The status of a vertex v in a graph is the sum of the distances between v and all vertices. The status sequence of a graph is the list of the statuses of all vertices arranged in non decreasing order. It is well known that non-isomorphic graphs may have the same status sequence. This paper gives a sufficient condition for a graph G with the property that there exists another graph G′ such that G′ and G have the same status sequence and G′ is not isomorphic to G.","authors":["Jen-Ling Shang"],"meta":["January 2014"],"references":["242910894_Counterexamples_to_Randic's_conjecture_on_distance_degree_sequences_for_trees","220570678_Constructing_Status_Injective_Graphs","220194089_Spiders_are_status_unique_in_trees","220081685_Unsolved_Problems_on_Distance_in_Graphs"]}
