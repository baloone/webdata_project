{"id":"343485644_An_exploratory_study_of_DevOps_and_it's_future_in_the_United_States","abstract":"This document will explore Deposits building blocks, and its future in the U.S. Every organization is a software company nowadays, and large companies are keen to take over huge segments of the economy. This is a coordinated approach that would not only eradicate the endless series of concurrent activities but also maintain an effective implementation process in the life cycle of software development (SDLC). Currently, a very organized approach is called DevOps and is characterized by fewer errors, more efficiency, and remarkable coordination. With so much written about DevOps, it's easy to forget that it's still in its early stages of maturity. But it is expected to grow well beyond its current status over the next few years. Technologists have made great strides to benefit from it ever since the DevOps ideation. Notwithstanding advancements and the progress teams have seen in pockets, many of the core problems still prevail: scaling across the organization due to manual processes, inadequate coordination across dev and ops teams, and overlapping tools that hinder agility. Fortunately, there are hopes in the future especially for organizations hoping to get the most out of DevOps. Software engineers now can continue to increase their knowledge to be ready for the next DevOps stage, through growth, delivery, and quality assurance. At the same time, all team leaders need to be prepared to handle some major challenges. Over the years, DevOps has begun to evolve and gain recognition. This trend has picked up the exponential pace with the advent of mobile phones. Today, the DevOps cycle continues to thrive on the principles of enhanced teamwork and automation to create, test, and release apps faster. DevOps will continue to be seen clearly in the U.S., in which continuous updates are transforming the way software is delivered to a near-limitless market. In this intensely competitive world of technology, DevOps has now become a must for economic development. DevOps has been a primary feature and influenced the tech landscape and many analysts expect that DevOps will become the standard and will hit its peak this year. To make DevOps work and to promote agility over the next ten years, the trick is pretty simple: Have the right team together at the right moment.","authors":["Sikender Mohsienuddin Mohammad"],"meta":["November 2016SSRN Electronic Journal 4(1):114-117","Project: DevOps -Automation"],"references":["343054310_CONTINUOUS_INTEGRATION_AND_AUTOMATION","303182727_On_the_Impact_of_Mixing_Responsibilities_Between_Devs_and_Ops","321929494_DevOps_for_Information_Management_Systems","315495774_DevOps_for_Developers","308868633_Automated_Capturing_and_Systematic_Usage_of_DevOps_Knowledge_for_Cloud_Applications","308730807_Understanding_DevOps_bridging_the_gap_from_continuous_integration_to_continuous_delivery","291931674_Pro_website_development_and_operations_Streamlining_devops_for_large-scale_websites","283656417_DevOps_A_Definition_and_Perceived_Adoption_Impediments","232920973_Visible_Ops_Security_Achieving_Common_Security_and_it_Operations_Objectives_in_Four_Practical_Steps","221554200_A_view_of_20th_and_21st_century_software_engineering"]}
