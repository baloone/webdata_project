{"id":"326368253_Pattern_Analysis_of_Learners'_Artifact_Making_Processes_and_Errors_in_Conceptual_Modeling_Exercises","abstract":"Conceptual modeling (CM) is an important technique in database design. Education of the technique is a challenge of computer science departments in higher education institutions. The aim of this study is to find patterns of learners' errors in their artifacts and their arti-fact making processes in conceptual modeling exercises. This study collected the data of learners' artifacts and the process of creating them in an exercise of CM using a system, KIfU 3.0, and conducted an association analysis with this data. As a result, this study found the association rules regarding learners' errors in the artifacts and/or their characteristics of the artifact making processes. For example, there are some errors that have a tendency to co-occur in the learners' artifacts, and learners who refine their artifacts frequently tend to detect attributes of concepts successfully even though they are hard to detect from a requirement specification for the exercise. This fact implies the effectiveness of our approach and a suggestion to improve teaching of the CM.","authors":["Takafumi Tanaka","Kousuke Mouri","Keiichi Kaneko"],"meta":["July 2018","DOI:10.52731/iee.v4.i1.283"],"references":["338066575_Interactive_Learning_Environments_Objectives_methodologies_and_research_issues_of_learning_analytics","321824916_Learning_Behavioral_Pattern_Analysis_based_on_Students'_Logs_in_Reading_Digital_Books","286658922_Comparing_top-down_with_bottom-up_approaches_Teaching_data_modeling","286540261_Ubiquitous_learning_analytics_in_the_real-world_language_learning","269291460_Integration_of_conceptual_data_modeling_methods_Higher_education_experiences","313606501_Mining_Association_rules_between_sets_of_items_in_large_databases","312484696_A_Method_for_Collecting_Learners'_Thinking_Process_in_ER_Modeling_Exercises_and_Its_Application_Experiment","312062166_Context-aware_and_personalization_method_based_on_ubiquitous_learning_analytics","289913752_A_Practical_Conceptual_Modeling_Teaching_Method_Based_on_Quantitative_Error_Analyses_for_Novices_Learning_to_Create_Error-Free_Simple_Class_Diagrams","285956479_Ubiquitous_Learning_Project_Using_Life-logging_Technology_in_Japan"]}
