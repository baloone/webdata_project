The role of invasive physiology in patients with MVD is unclear.\n\nMethods: \nIn 18 centers, 484 patients undergoing diagnostic angiography disclosing MVD with lesions >40% by visual assessment were included. Investigators were asked to prospectively define their initial management strategy based on angiography and clinical information. Invasive physiology (FFR or iFR driven) was then performed and final strategy defined. Initial and final vessel, patient, procedural, and overall management were described. Reclassification was defined as the difference between initial and final strategy.\n\nResults: \nThe majority of patients were clinically stable (82.2%). Two- and 3-vessel disease was present in 73.3% and 26.7% of patients, respectively. Lesions investigated were \"intermediate\" with median percent stenosis, median FFR, and median iFR at 60% (interquartile range [IQR]: 50% to 70%), 0.84 (IQR: 0.78 to 0.90), and 0.92 (IQR: 0.85 to 0.96), respectively. Vessel management was reclassified by physiology in 30.0% (249 of 828) of vessels. Patient and overall management were reclassified in 26.9% (130 of 484) and 45.7% (211 of 484) of patients, respectively. Reclassification rates were high irrespective of initial management (optimal medical therapy, percutaneous coronary intervention, or coronary artery bypass grafting), and performance and results of pre-procedural noninvasive tests. Reclassification of overall management in particular increased with the number of vessels investigated (1 vessel: 37.3%; 2 vessels: 45.0%; 3 vessels: 66.7%; p = 0.002). Incorporating iFR in the decision process was associated with investigation of more vessels (p = 0.04) and higher reclassification (p = 0.0001).\n\nConclusions: \nIn patients with MVD and intermediate coronary lesions, invasive physiology at time of angiography reclassifies revascularization strategy in a large proportion of cases (26.9%) and investigation of more vessels is associated with higher reclassification rates.","authors":["Eric van Belle","Robert J Gil","Volker Klauss","Mohammed A Balghith"],"meta":["February 2018JACC.
