{"id":"256568205_Second_language_vocabulary_learning_among_adults_State_of_the_art_in_vocabulary_instruction","abstract":"This article describes research on second language vocabulary instruction, with a focus on what motivates students, what they need, why knowing a word is a complex act, and which factors influence vocabulary acquisition (such as maturational constraints, frequency, attention, previous language background, and order of acquisition). In addition, the article outlines a research-based approach to vocabulary teaching based on four elements: analysis of needs, personalization, learning strategies, and variety.","authors":["Rebecca Oxford","Robin C.
