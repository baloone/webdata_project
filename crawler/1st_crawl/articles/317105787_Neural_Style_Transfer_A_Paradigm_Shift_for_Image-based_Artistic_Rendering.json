{"id":"317105787_Neural_Style_Transfer_A_Paradigm_Shift_for_Image-based_Artistic_Rendering","abstract":"In this meta paper we discuss image-based artistic rendering (IB-AR) based on neural style transfer (NST) and argue, while NST may represent a paradigm shift for IB-AR, that it also has to evolve as an interactive tool that considers the design aspects and mechanisms of artwork production. IB-AR received significant attention in the past decades for visual communication, covering a plethora of techniques to mimic the appeal of artistic media. Example-based rendering represents one the most promising paradigms in IB-AR to (semi-)automatically simulate artistic media with high fidelity, but so far has been limited because it relies on pre-defined image pairs for training or informs only low-level image features for texture transfers. Advancements in deep learning showed to alleviate these limitations by matching content and style statistics via activations of neural network layers, thus making a generalized style transfer practicable. We categorize style transfers within the taxonomy of IB-AR, then propose a semiotic structure to derive a technical research agenda for NSTs with respect to the grand challenges of NPAR. We finally discuss the potentials of NSTs, thereby identifying applications such as casual creativity and art production.","authors":["Amir Semmo","Tobias Isenberg","Jürgen Döllner"],"meta":["July 2017","DOI:10.1145/3092919.3092920","Conference: Non-Photorealistic Animation and Rendering (NPAR)At: Los Angeles, CA, USA","Project: Image and Video Abstraction"],"references":["324636620_Selected_Papers_Vol_4_Theory_and_Philosophy_of_Art_Style_Artist_and_Society","322060368_Arbitrary_Style_Transfer_in_Real-Time_with_Adaptive_Instance_Normalization","322057816_Characterizing_and_Improving_Stability_in_Neural_Style_Transfer","320968287_Improved_Texture_Networks_Maximizing_Quality_and_Diversity_in_Feed-Forward_Stylization_and_Texture_Synthesis","320968109_Controlling_Perceptual_Factors_in_Neural_Style_Transfer","319770225_Artistic_style_transfer_for_videos","319770215_A_Learned_Representation_For_Artistic_Style","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","318763990_Depth-aware_neural_style_transfer","318716087_Bringing_impressionism_to_life_with_neural_style_transfer_in_Come_Swim","315928841_Art-directed_watercolor_stylization_of_3D_animations_in_real-time","315489372_Multi-style_Generative_Network_for_Real-time_Transfer","317246849_A_Survey_of_Digital_Stippling","316736819_Characterizing_and_Improving_Stability_in_Neural_Style_Transfer","315457372_Arbitrary_Style_Transfer_in_Real-time_with_Adaptive_Instance_Normalization"]}
