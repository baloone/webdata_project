{"id":"227651260_e-Assessment_and_the_student_learning_experience_A_survey_of_student_perceptions_of_e-assessment","abstract":"This paper describes a piece of research carried out at the University of Bradford into student perceptions of e-assessment. An online questionnaire was delivered to 130 undergraduates who had taken part in online assessment (either formative or summative) during the academic year 2007â€“2008. The survey looked at six main dimensions: (1) affective factors, (2) validity, (3) practical issues, (4) reliability, (5) security, and (6) learning and teaching. The aim of the survey was to identify possible risks in planning e-assessments, as well as to gauge student opinion. The findings of the survey indicated a range of opinions across the student body, with greatest concern about the fairness of item banking. It was also found that the most positive aspect of e-assessment in the eyes of students concerned the benefits that it can bring to teaching and learning. In addition, the paper concludes that age and gender did not significantly affect student responses in any of the areas studied.","authors":["John Dermo"],"meta":["January 2009British Journal of Educational Technology 40(2):203 - 214","DOI:10.1111/j.1467-8535.2008.00915.x"],"references":["307815652_The_impact_of_educational_technology_a_radical_reappraisal_of_research_methods","307717070_The_evolving_landscape_of_learning_technology","48352673_Secure_reliable_and_effective_institution-wide_e-assessment_paving_the_way_for_new_technologies","44824604_Research_Methods_in_Education","29812145_The_evolving_landscape_of_learning_technology","29811990_The_impact_of_educational_technology_A_radical_reappraisal_of_research_methods","28576326_CAA_in_UK_HEIs_-_the_state_of_the_art","344664370_Researching_Education_Perspectives_and_Techniques","319394831_Questionnaire_Design_Interviewing_and_Attitude_Measurement","317842502_Research_Methods_in_Social_Sciences","299428004_Chapter_10_Understanding_Enthusiasm_and_Implementation_E-Learning_Research_Questions_and_Methodological_Issues","287236043_Psychological_testing_An_introduction_Second_edition","275413034_Quantative_Data_Analysis_with_SPSS_Release_10_for_Windows_A_Guide_for_Social_Scientists","271112182_Questionnaire_Design_Interviewing_and_Attitude_Measurement","270960149_Research_Methods_In_Education","269583600_Research_Methods_in_the_Social_Science","262258788_The_e-Assessment_Handbook","246146646_Exploring_Data_An_Introduction_to_Data_Analysis_for_Social_Scientists","243774862_A_Blueprint_for_Computer-Assisted_Assessment","236144012_Research_Design_in_Social_Research","235316599_Digital_Natives_Digital_Immigrants_Part_1","233571934_Reclaiming_philosophy_for_educational_research","230557511_Mail_and_Internet_Surveys_The_Tailored_Design_Method","229790150_Computerised_Psychological_Testing_An_Introduction","49305666_Psychological_Testing","48352556_Benefits_and_obstacles_factors_affecting_the_uptake_of_CAA_in_undergraduate_courses","44815693_Questionnaire_Design_Interviewing_And_Attitude_Measurement"]}
