{"id":"340701721_A_full_night's_sleep_at_home_improves_memory_performance_in_an_associative_and_relational_learning_task","abstract":"This study evaluated the effect of sleep in mediating episodic memory performances in a recognition task of visually associated and related elements. It also considered links between memory performances, dreams mentation and emotional salience of items. Two groups of\nparticipants were studied, in the wake group they stayed awake on a normal day and in the sleep group they slept at home according to their usual sleep schedule and context. Compared to the wake group, participants in the sleep group performed better in the delayed associative and relational tests. The emotional valence of the images affected the results with no selective group effect. Examination of dream reports suggested that dreams are linked to this memory enhancement. The study demonstrated how new associative and relational links can be created in memory following a full night’s sleep.\n\nKeywords: Sleep, memory, dream, relational, associative, emotion","authors":["Nicolas Ribeiro","Yannick Gounden","Véronique Quaglino"],"meta":["April 2020Dreaming 30(2)","DOI:10.1037/drm0000130"],"references":["326916310_Dreaming_of_a_learning_task_is_associated_with_enhanced_memory_consolidation_Replication_in_an_overnight_sleep_study","320341861_Characteristics_of_the_memory_sources_of_dreams_A_new_version_of_the_content-matching_paradigm_to_take_mundane_and_remote_memories_into_account","307415722_Investigating_on_the_Methodology_Effect_When_Evaluating_Lucid_Dream","262299891_ACT-IN_An_integrated_view_of_memory_mechanisms","41531580_Daytime_napping_Effects_on_human_direct_associative_and_relational_memory","23388744_CNTRICS_final_task_selection_long-term_memory","14321915_The_Effect_of_Polysomnography_on_Sleep_Position_Possible_Implications_on_the_Diagnosis_of_Positional_Obstructive_Sleep_Apnea","13737662_Changes_in_EEG_Power_Density_During_Sleep_Laboratory_Adaptation","12059393_Emotional_Memory_Formation_Is_Enhanced_across_Sleep_Intervals_with_High_Amounts_of_Rapid_Eye_Movement_Sleep","326916288_The_effect_of_dream_report_collection_and_dream_incorporation_on_memory_consolidation_during_sleep","325851836_Effects_of_early_morning_nap_sleep_on_associative_memory_for_neutral_and_emotional_stimuli","324058867_Reliability_and_Stability_of_Dream_Recall_Frequency_comparing_retrospective_and_logbook_evaluations","313541811_Is_Dreaming_Related_to_Sleep-Dependent_Memory_Consolidation","256539499_Interplay_of_Hippocampus_and_Prefrontal_Cortex_in_Memory","232496863_Associative_encoding_and_retrieval_Weak_and_strong_cues","229089736_Hippocampal_and_Ventral_Medial_Prefrontal_Activation_during_Retrieval-Mediated_Learning_Supports_Novel_Inference","223993513_Memory_formation_consolidation_and_transformation","220612060_A_new_ranking_method_for_Principal_Components_Analysis_and_its_application_to_face_image_analysis","11879834_The_first-night_effect_may_last_more_than_one_night","8605472_Hippocampal_contribution_to_the_novel_use_of_relational_information_in_declarative_memory","8265477_Sleep-Dependent_Learning_and_Memory_Consolidation"]}
