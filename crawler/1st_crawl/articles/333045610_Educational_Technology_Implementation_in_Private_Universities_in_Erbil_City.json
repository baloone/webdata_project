{"id":"333045610_Educational_Technology_Implementation_in_Private_Universities_in_Erbil_City","abstract":"These days technologies have become in many parts of life more than ever before. One of the major\nchallenges in dealing with various technologies is to implement them in a useful way to improve life quality.\nSince educational technologies can play a big role in developing both the teaching and learning process, thatâ€™s\nwhy the author chose this field for this research. The purpose of this paper is to explore the status of\neducational technology in a few selected private universities inside Erbil city to get a perception of\ndevelopment areas and to develop a survey for that purpose. To fulfil the objective of this paper, the author\npresented these study findings based on the developed survey, observations, interviews, and related work to\ndevelop an educational technology investment in universities. The result shows that the majority of private\nuniversities still have no Learning Management System (LMS) to manage classroom activities. In addition,\nmany instructors are using some LMSs to incorporate technology in classrooms. The result of this paper also\nshows that classroom technology should be developed and extended beyond using projectors and emails.","authors":["Mohammed Salim"],"meta":["March 2019International Journal Social Sciences and Education 5(3):303-310","DOI:10.23918/ijsses.v5i3p303"],"references":["343499587_The_Significance_of_Educational_Technology_in_Teaching_Learning_process","329375249_The_Role_of_Information_Technology_on_Teaching_Process_in_Education_An_Analytical_Prospective_Study_at_University_of_Sulaimani","326914487_Educational_Planning_Approaches_Trends_and_Learnings_A_Case_Study_of_the_Kurdistan_Region_of_Iraq_KRI","316600734_Developing_a_New_e-Exam_Platform_to_Enhance_the_University_Academic_Examinations_the_Case_of_Lebanese_French_University","316440720_Supporting_Mobile_Learning_with_WhatsApp_based_on_Media_Richness","310491597_Educational_Technology_A_Review_of_the_Integration_Resources_and_Effectiveness_of_Technology_in_K-12_Classrooms","307559585_E-Learning_at_Private_Universities_in_Kurdistan_Region_A_Comparative_Field_Study","298796317_Using_Technology_To_Create_A_Dynamic_Classroom_Experience","281571575_The_Effectiveness_of_Using_E-Learning_in_Malaysian_Higher_Education_A_Case_Study_Universiti_Teknologi_Malaysia","274668917_Relationships_among_Preservice_Teachers'_Technology-Related_Abilities_Beliefs_and_Intentions_to_Use_Technology_in_Their_Future_Classrooms"]}
