{"id":"327523950_Ionic_decision-maker_created_as_novel_solid-state_devices","abstract":"Decision-making is being performed frequently in areas of computation to obtain better performance in a wide variety of current intelligent activities. In practical terms, this decision-making must adapt to dynamic changes in environmental conditions. However, because of limited computational resources, adaptive decision-making is generally difficult to achieve using conventional computers. The ionic decision-maker reported here, which uses electrochemical phenomena, has excellent dynamic adaptabilities, as demonstrated by its ability to solve multiarmed bandit problems (MBPs) in which a gambler given a choice of slot machines must select the appropriate machines to play so as to maximize the total reward in a series of trials. Furthermore, our ionic decision-maker successfully solves dynamic competitive MBPs, which cause serious loss due to the collision of selfish users in communication networks. The technique used in our devices offers a shift toward decision-making using the motion of ions, an approach that could find myriad applications in computer science and technology, including artificial intelligence.","authors":["Takashi Tsuchiya","Tohru Tsuruoka","Song-Ju Kim","Kazuya Terabe"],"meta":["September 2018Science Advances 4(9):eaau2057","DOI:10.1126/sciadv.aau2057"],"references":["281036033_Single-photon_decision_maker","280330333_Decision_Maker_based_on_Atomic_Switches","270443256_Amoeba-inspired_algorithm_for_cognitive_medium_access","269877142_Efficient_Decision-Making_by_Volume-Conserving_Physical_Object","267039524_Decision_making_based_on_optical_excitation_transfer_via_near-field_interactions_between_quantum_dots","311462580_Harnessing_the_Computational_Power_of_Fluids_for_Optimization_of_Collective_Decision_Making","303402472_Ag2S_atomic_switch-based_'tug_of_war'_for_decision_making","289489157_In_Situ_Tuning_of_Magnetization_and_Magnetoresistance_in_Fe3O4_Thin_Film_Achieved_with_All-Solid-State_Redox_Device","271598434_In_Situ_and_Nonvolatile_Photoluminescence_Tuning_and_Nanodomain_Writing_Demonstrated_by_All-Solid-State_Devices_Based_on_Graphene_Oxide","262825220_In_Situ_and_Non-Volatile_Bandgap_Tuning_of_Multilayer_Graphene_Oxide_in_an_All-Solid-State_Electric_Double-Layer_Transistor"]}
