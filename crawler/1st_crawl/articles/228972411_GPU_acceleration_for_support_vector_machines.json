{"id":"228972411_GPU_acceleration_for_support_vector_machines","abstract":"This paper presents a GPU-assisted version of the LIB-SVM library for Support Vector Machines. SVMs are par-ticularly popular for classification procedures among the re-search community, but for large training data the processing time becomes unrealistic. The modification that is proposed is porting the computation of the kernel matrix elements to the GPU, to significantly decrease the processing time for SVM training without altering the classification results compared to the original LIBSVM. The experimental evaluation of the proposed approach highlights how the GPU-accelerated ver-sion of LIBSVM enables the more efficient handling of large problems, such as large-scale concept detection in video.","authors":["Andreas Athanasopoulos","Anastasios Dimou","Vasileios Mezaris","Ioannis (Yiannis) Kompatsiaris"],"meta":["January 2011"],"references":["228804100_cuSVM_a_CUDA_implementation_of_support_vector_classification_and_regression","224358980_Gradual_transition_detection_using_color_coherence_and_other_criteria_in_a_video_shot_meta-segmentation_framework","224323302_Evaluating_color_descriptors_for_object_and_scene_recognition","224201443_On_the_use_of_feature_tracks_for_dynamic_concept_detection_in_video","224191144_Empowering_Visual_Categorization_With_the_GPU","221345076_Fast_support_vector_machine_training_and_classification_on_graphics_processors","220817026_Chunking_with_Support_Vector_Machines","271513141_Support_Vector_Networks","228715647_LIBSVM_A_library_for_support_vector_machines","221620344_PSVM_Parallelizing_Support_Vector_Machines_on_Distributed_Computers"]}
