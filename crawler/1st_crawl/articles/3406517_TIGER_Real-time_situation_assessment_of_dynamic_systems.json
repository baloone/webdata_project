{"id":"3406517_TIGER_Real-time_situation_assessment_of_dynamic_systems","abstract":"The paper describes the work of the TIGER ESPRIT Project in\nperforming real-time situation assessment of dynamic systems. The goal\nof TIGER is to monitor a complex dynamic system in real time and make an\nassessment of whether it is working properly. If it is not working\nproperly, it is desirable to identify the cause of the problem either\nfrom a set of known faults or to characterise an unknown fault. This\nwork is applied in the application domain of condition monitoring of gas\nturbines. The project is developing and demonstrating its techniques on\ntwo industrial gas turbines; a 28 mW gas turbine used as the prime power\nfor a chemical plant and a small auxiliary power gas turbine used in\naviation. The Project is investigating a variety of tools and techniques\nfor real-time situation assessment. These include a high-speed\nrule-based compiler, a situation assessment tool able to monitor dynamic\nresponses over time, qualitative and numerical prediction of turbine\nresponse, and model-based diagnosis to help identify unknown faults. A\nprototype system is currently in use at a chemical plant performing\nmonitoring and diagnosis in real-time","authors":["R. Milne","Charlie Nicol","M.
