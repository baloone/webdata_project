{"id":"334093378_Compliant_Aerial_Manipulators_with_Dual_Arms","abstract":"The chapter presents the design and modelling of compliant dual arms for aerial manipulation. Physical compliance in the arm joints contributes to increase safety, reliability and robustness of the system during its operation on flight, especially during interaction tasks. The chapter also presents validation experiments of the arms mounted on multirotors.","authors":["Alejandro Suarez","Guillermo Heredia","Anibal Ollero"],"meta":["June 2019","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-12945-3_6","In book: Aerial Robotic Manipulation (pp.83-95)"],"references":["286805558_Adaptive_control_for_UAVs_equipped_with_a_robotic_arm","284190749_Design_modeling_and_control_of_a_5-DoF_light-weight_robot_arm_for_aerial_manipulation","281886795_Design_Identification_and_Experimental_Testing_of_a_Light-weight_Flexible-joint_Arm_for_Aerial_Physical_Interaction","235285803_Series_elastic_actuators_for_high_fidelity_force_control","324957209_Design_of_an_Anthropomorphic_Compliant_and_Lightweight_Dual_Arm_for_Aerial_Manipulation","324141827_Design_of_a_lightweight_dual_arm_system_for_aerial_manipulation","323404996_Physical-Virtual_Impedance_Control_in_Ultra-Lightweight_and_Compliant_Dual_Arm_Aerial_Manipulators","321976403_Vision-Based_Deflection_Estimation_in_an_Anthropomorphic_Compliant_and_Lightweight_Dual_Arm","312446214_Lightweight_compliant_arm_with_compliant_finger_for_aerial_manipulation_and_inspection","308824126_Lightweight_compliant_arm_for_aerial_manipulation","306290360_Differential_Flatness_and_Control_of_Protocentric_Aerial_Manipulators_with_Any_Number_of_Arms_and_Mixed_Rigid-Elastic-Joints","301435490_Adaptive_Control_for_UAVs_Equipped_with_a_Robotic_Arm","291396942_Compliant_Aerial_Manipulators_Toward_a_New_Generation_of_Aerial_Robotic_Workers","269299881_Valve_turning_using_a_dual-arm_aerial_manipulator","261202244_Control_of_quadrotor_aerial_vehicles_equipped_with_a_robotic_arm","224998293_A_Unified_Passivity_Based_Control_Framework_for_Position_Torque_and_Impedance_Control_of_Flexible_Joint_Robots","224998292_A_Unified_Passivity_Based_Control_Framework_for_Position_Torque_and_Impedance_Control_of_Flexible_Joint_Robots","3450600_On_the_Passivity-Based_Impedance_Control_of_Flexible_Joint_Robots"]}
