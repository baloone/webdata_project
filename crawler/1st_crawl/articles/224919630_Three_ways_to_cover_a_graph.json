{"id":"224919630_Three_ways_to_cover_a_graph","abstract":"We consider the problem of covering a host graph $G$ with several graphs from\na fixed template class ${T}$. The classical covering number of $G$ with respect\nto ${T}$ is the minimum number of template graphs needed to cover the edges of\n$G$. We introduce two new parameters: the local and the folded covering number.\nEach parameter measures how far $G$ is from the template class in a different\nway. Whereas the folded covering number has been investigated thoroughly for\nsome template classes, e.g., interval graphs and planar graphs, the local\ncovering number was given only little attention.\nWe provide new bounds on each covering number w.r.t. the following template\nclasses: linear forests, star forests, caterpillar forests, and interval\ngraphs. The classical graph parameters turning up this way are interval-number,\ntrack-number, and linear-, star-, and caterpillar arboricity. As host graphs we\nconsider graphs of bounded degeneracy, bounded degree, or bounded (simple)\ntree-width, as well as, outerplanar, planar bipartite and planar graphs. For\nseveral pairs of a host class and a template class we determine the maximum\n(local, folded) covering number of a host graph w.r.t. that template class\nexactly.","authors":["Kolja Knauer","Torsten Ueckerdt"],"meta":["May 2012Discrete Mathematics 339(2)","DOI:10.1016/j.disc.2015.10.023","SourcearXiv"],"references":["268652766_On_covering_of_graphs","267185393_Evolution_of_the_path_number_of_a_graph_covering_and_packing_in_graphs_II","265365522_Covering_and_packing_in_graphs_III_Cyclic_and_acyclic_invariants","259643788_Splittings_of_Graphs_on_Surfaces","244487249_Path_factors_of_a_graph","225923290_On_chromatic_number_of_graphs_and_set_systems","222020275_Star_arboricity_of_graphs","221209270_Determining_DNA_Sequence_Similarity_Using_Maximum_Independent_Set_Algorithms_for_Interval_Graphs","220779156_Scheduling_Split_Intervals","220617459_Scheduling_Split_Intervals","220390641_Optimization_problems_in_multiple-interval_graphs","318673810_The_Star_Arboricity_of_Graphs","288945035_Wiley-Interscience_Series_in_Discrete_Mathematics_and_Optimization","268625662_Every_outerplanar_graph_is_the_union_of_two_interval_graphs","266283364_Decompositions_of_complete_graphs_into_forests","266215321_Multitrack_interval_graphs","264966363_Multidimensional_interval_graphs","256624159_Covering_and_packing_in_graphs-V_Mispacking_subcubes_in_hypercubes","246394455_How_to_orient_the_edges_of_a_graph","243087453_Decomposition_of_Finite_Graphs_Into_Forests","238711642_Congruent_Graphs_and_the_Connectivity_of_Graphs","235986105_Edge_intersection_graphs_of_linear_3-uniform_hypergraphs","229751065_On_the_linear_arboricity_of_planar_graphs","229748808_On_double_and_multiple_interval_graphs","229610142_A_network_flow_solution_of_some_non-linear_0-1_programming_problems_and_applications_to_graph_theory","229548319_Covering_and_packing_in_graphs_IV_Linear_arboricity","228056191_Covering_and_packing_in_graphs-V","227902350_Some_results_on_linear_arboricity","226116403_A_survey_of_packings_and_coverings_of_graphs","225660001_Die_Theorie_der_Regularen_Graphs","225607843_Linear_Arboricity_and_Linear_k-Arboricity_of_Regular_Graphs","225179760_Recognizing_d-Interval_Graphs_and_d-Track_Interval_Graphs","222769578_The_Star_Arboricity_of_Graphs","222285188_Recognizing_graphs_with_fixed_interval_number_is_NP-complete","221949757_Bipartite_dimensions_and_bipartite_degrees_of_graphs","221164086_Scheduling_Algorithms_for_Multi-Hop_Radio_Networks","220991246_On_Rectangle_Visibility_Graphs_III_External_Visibility_and_Complexity","220617300_The_NP-Completeness_of_Edge-Coloring","220548942_The_linear_arboricity_of_planar_graphs_of_maximum_degree_seven_is_four","220441945_Partitioning_Graphs_of_Bounded_Tree-Width","220441740_Star_arboricity","220397728_On_the_Decomposition_of_Graphs_into_Complete_Bipartite_Graphs","220224284_Multilayer_grid_embeddings_for_VLSI","220185949_On_two_dual_classes_of_planar_graphs","220185655_A_short_proof_of_the_degree_bound_on_interval_number","220185546_On_Star_and_Caterpillar_Arboricity","220185358_Caterpillar_arboricity_of_planar_graphs","220078750_Covers_of_Eulerian_Graphs","220075889_The_interval_number_of_a_planar_graph_Three_intervals_suffice","51964403_On_the_Bend-Number_of_Planar_and_Outerplanar_Graphs","30508854_Representation_of_planar_graphs_by_segments","2892591_The_Subchromatic_Index_of_Graphs","43355088_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Predicting_RNA_Secondary_Structures_with_Arbitrary_Pseudoknots","30770586_Extremal_Values_of_the_Interval_Number_of_a_Graph","2624994_Every_Outerplanar_Graph_Is_The_Union_Of_Two_Interval_Graphs"]}
