{"id":"226549712_General_Formal_Ontology_GFO_A_Foundational_Ontology_for_Conceptual_Modelling","abstract":"The current chapter presents an overview about the current stage of the foundational ontology GFO. GFO (General Formal Ontology).\nGFO is a foundational ontology integrating objects and processes. It is being developed by the research group Onto-Med (Ontologies\nin Medicine) at the University of Leipzig. Unique selling properties of GFO are the following: it includes categories of objects\n(3D objects) as well as of processes (4D entities) and both are integrated into one coherent framework. GFO presents a multi-categorial\napproach by admitting universals, concepts, and symbol structures and their interrelations. GFO adopts categories pertaining\nto levels of reality, and it is designed to support interoperability by principles of ontological mapping and reduction. GFO\ncontains several novel ontological modules, in particular, a module for functions and a module for roles. GFO is designed\nfor applications, firstly in medical, biological, and biomedical areas, but also in the fields of economics and sociology.","authors":["Heinrich Herre"],"meta":["September 2010","DOI:10.1007/978-90-481-8847-5_14","In book: Theory and Applications of Ontology: Computer Applications (pp.297-345)"],"references":["333190171_Ontological_Investigations_An_Inquiry_into_the_Categories_of_Nature_Man_and_Soceity","349709777_Der_Streit_um_die_Existenz_der_Welt_Band_1_Existentialontologie","344896347_Four-Dimensionalism","344668532_Der_Aufbau_der_realen_Welt_Grundriss_der_allgemeinen_Kategorienlehre","344485011_A_World_of_States_of_Affairs","321524558_Texts_in_Theoretical_Computer_Science_An_EATCS_Series","320181808_The_Construction_of_Social_Reality","319395635_The_Description_Logic_Handbook_Theory_Implementation_and_Applications","317869510_A_World_of_States_of_Affairs","313751764_An_overview_of_ONTOCLEAN"]}
