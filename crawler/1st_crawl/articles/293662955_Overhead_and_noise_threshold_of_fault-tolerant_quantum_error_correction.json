{"id":"293662955_Overhead_and_noise_threshold_of_fault-tolerant_quantum_error_correction","abstract":"Quantum error correction (QEC) may allow a precision â‰ª10-6 per logical operation to be attained in quantum computers. In order for this to be possible, QEC must be applied in a fault tolerant manner, where the QEC process is constructed so that it removes more noise than it generates when it is itself imperfect. This paper addresses the problem of estimating the amount of noise that can be tolerated, and quantifying the cost of the stability in terms of the required increase in the number of physical qubits in the computer.","authors":["Andrew Steane"],"meta":["October 2003"],"references":["2187691_Quantum_computer_architecture_for_fast_entropy_extraction"]}
