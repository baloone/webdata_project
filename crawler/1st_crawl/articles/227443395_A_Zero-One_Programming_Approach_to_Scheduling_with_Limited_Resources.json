{"id":"227443395_A_Zero-One_Programming_Approach_to_Scheduling_with_Limited_Resources","abstract":"A zero-one (0-1) linear programming formulation of multiproject and job-shop scheduling problems is presented that is more general and computationally tractable than other known formulations. It can accommodate a wide range of real-world situations including multiple resource constraints, due dates, job splitting, resource, substitutability, and concurrency and nonconcurrency of job performance requirements. Three possible objective functions are discussed; minimizing total throughput time for all projects: minimizing the time by which all projects are completed (i.e., minimizing makespan); and minimizing total lateness or lateness penalty for all projects.","authors":["A.
