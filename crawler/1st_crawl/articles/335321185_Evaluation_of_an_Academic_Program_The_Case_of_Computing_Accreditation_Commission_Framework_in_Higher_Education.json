{"id":"335321185_Evaluation_of_an_Academic_Program_The_Case_of_Computing_Accreditation_Commission_Framework_in_Higher_Education","abstract":"This study aims to present the ABET-CAC accreditation framework and discusses how to manage a program’s constituencies of an academic\nprogram in higher education. It describes the program’s associated entities and the methods of creating required evidence for the program accreditation in computer science education. It follows a mixed-method to evaluate and measure the program performance. It discusses the program’s performance measurement methods and analysis. It emphasizes the program’s entities such as students\nlearning outcomes, course assessment and performance evaluation. It shows a scientific approach that measures the program’s performance. It suggests the evidence should be considered as essential indicators for both when planning the quality improvement for the program delivery and program’s benchmarking. For any program accreditation in computing education, the framework\nneeds to be followed at least for two years to ease the program’s review process. This will help in preparing competently for the accreditation, ahead of program’s review visit by the commission.","authors":["Khalid Mohiuddin","Asharul Islam","Shiblee Mohd","Mansoor Shariff"],"meta":["August 2019"],"references":["307619155_Mining_Educational_Data_for_Academic_Accreditation_Aligning_Assessment_with_Outcomes","307552008_An_outcome-based_assessment_process_for_accrediting_computing_programmes","293808400_Indicators_Development_for_Accreditation_of_Teacher_Education_Programs_in_Thailand","283723527_Assessment_rubrics_towards_clearer_and_more_replicable_design_research_and_practice","329473500_Adapting_to_New_Student_Outcomes_to_Meet_New_ABET_Criteria_for_Computing_Programs","320719038_Rethinking_ABET_Accreditation_of_Computer_Science_Degree_Programs","312808507_Present_Status_and_Challenges_Ahead_for_Engineering_Education_Global_and_National_Perspectives","312422897_Introducing_Visualization_and_Tableau","302493756_Google_Analytics_Fundamentals","288161974_The_Role_of_Accreditation_of_Higher_Education_Institutions","282536000_Assessment_of_Higher_Education_Quality_by_Using_Cohort_of_First-year_in_University","275542935_International_Accreditation_for_Engineering_Programs_Mission_Learning_Objectives_and_Outcomes","271617495_The_Quality_Indicators_of_Information_Technology_in_Higher_Education","266320284_Developing_and_Qualifying_Civil_Engineering_Programs_for_ABET_Accreditation","277619954_ABET_Accreditation_of_Engineering_Management_Programs_Contemporary_and_Future_Issues"]}
