{"id":"325574118_An_Intelligent_Bio-Inspired_Algorithm_for_the_Faculty_Scheduling_Problem","abstract":"All universities have faculty members who need to\nbe assigned to teach courses. Those members have various\nspecialties, preferences and different levels of experience. The\nmanual assignment of courses is a very tedious and timeconsuming\ntask that the scheduling committee frequently faces in\nevery department. To solve this timetabling problem, we\nproposed a novel approach using the Bees Algorithm (BA), which\nis inspired from beesâ€™ foraging behavior, hybridized with Demon\nalgorithm and Hill Climbing for more extensive search. The\nscheduling process took into consideration all constraints and\nvariables associated with scheduling courses, according to the\nrequirements of the Computer Science department in our college.\nThe results showed that the schedules produced from the\nalgorithm outperformed the manual schedules in terms of\nachieving the objective function and satisfying the constraints. In\naddition, the hybridized version produced better results than the\nstandard BA version without hybridization. The hybridized\nalgorithm is designed for faculty scheduling, but can be further\ngeneralized to solve various timetabling problems.","authors":["Sarah Al-Negheimish","Fai Alnuhait","Hawazen Albrahim","Sarah Al-Mogherah"],"meta":["January 2018International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications 9(5)","DOI:10.14569/IJACSA.2018.090519"],"references":["258737544_A_Heuristic_Algorithm_for_the_Faculty_Assignment_Problem","255711117_Metaheuristic_Algorithms_Optimal_Balance_of_Intensification_and_Diversification","242668159_Solving_the_Teacher_Assignment-Course_Scheduling_Problem_by_a_Hybrid_Algorithm","237502795_A_Genetic_Algorithm_for_the_Teacher_Assignment_Problem_for_a_University_in_Indonesia","235709725_Evolutionary_Algorithm_Parameters_and_Methods_to_Tune_Them","228579574_Solving_the_Teacher_Assignment_Problem_by_Two_Metaheuristics","308837469_Application_of_genetic_algorithm_for_class_scheduling_Case_study_Faculty_of_science_and_technology_UIN_Jakarta","271482521_Highly_constrained_university_course_scheduling_using_modified_hybrid_particle_swarm_optimization","259022192_Genetic_Algorithms","228747344_Genetic_algorithms_An_overview"]}
