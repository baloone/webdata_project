{"id":"335769607_ConnSpoiler_Disrupting_CC_Communication_of_IoT-Based_Botnet_Through_Fast_Detection_of_Anomalous_Domain_Queries","abstract":"The development of Internet of Things (IoT) dramatically facilitates the integration of computing systems with the physical world. However, as IoT devices are more easily to compromise than desktop computers, cybercriminals have founded IoT-based botnets to launch DDoS attacks with unprecedented traffic volume. To mitigate the damages associated with these attacks, the detection of IoT-based botnet has to preempt the C&C (Command and Control) communication to prevent the delivery of the attack codes.","authors":["Lihua Yin","Xi Luo","Chunsheng Zhu","Liming Wang"],"meta":["September 2019IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TII.2019.2940742"],"references":["354701113_A_Comprehensive_Measurement_Study_of_Domain_Generating_Malware","331541092_A_Feature_Extraction_Method_for_P2P_Botnet_Detection_Using_Graphic_Symmetry_Concept","280223161_From_Throw-Away_Traffic_to_Bots_Detecting_the_Rise_of_DGA-Based_Malware","221609510_An_effective_defense_against_email_spam_laundering","220269670_Detecting_Algorithmically_Generated_Malicious_Domain_Names","4075959_Fast_portscan_detection_using_sequential_hypothesis_testing","345418883_Evaluating_Reputation_Management_Schemes_of_Internet_of_Vehicles_Based_on_Evolutionary_Game_Theory","332190583_Block-DEF_A_Secure_Digital_Evidence_Framework_using_Blockchain","332055056_Real-Time_Lateral_Movement_Detection_Based_on_Evidence_Reasoning_Network_for_Edge_Computing_Environment","330139403_A_data-driven_method_for_future_Internet_route_decision_modeling","328523375_LagProber_Detecting_DGA-Based_Malware_by_Using_Query_Time_Lag_of_Non-existent_Domains_20th_International_Conference_ICICS_2018_Lille_France_October_29-31_2018_Proceedings","325731086_Toward_a_Comprehensive_Insight_Into_the_Eclipse_Attacks_of_Tor_Hidden_Services","325516366_Enhancing_Privacy_and_Availability_for_Data_Clustering_in_Intelligent_Electrical_Service_of_IoT","323156236_Trust-Based_Communication_for_the_Industrial_Internet_of_Things","321793071_Secure_Multimedia_Big_Data_in_Trust-Assisted_Sensor-Cloud_for_Smart_City","319926727_On_Botnet_Detection_with_Genetic_Programming_Under_Streaming_Data_Label_Budgets_and_Class_Imbalance","317926521_A_Lustrum_of_Malware_Network_Communication_Evolution_and_Insights","313691763_Stealthy_Domain_Generation_Algorithms_DGAs","309663748_Predicting_Domain_Generation_Algorithms_with_Long_Short-Term_Memory_Networks","308978280_DBod_Clustering_and_detecting_DGA-based_botnets_using_DNS_traffic_analysis","299636284_Detecting_domain-flux_botnet_based_on_DNS_traffic_features_in_managed_network","289744882_Finding_Domain-Generation_Algorithms_by_Looking_at_Length_Distribution","270397698_DFBotKiller_Domain-flux_botnet_detection_based_on_the_history_of_group_activities_and_failures_in_DNS_traffic","261961423_Kindred_domains_detecting_and_clustering_botnet_domains_using_DNS_traffic","261247422_Crossing_the_threshold_Detecting_network_malfeasance_via_sequential_hypothesis_testing","221655512_BotSniffer_Detecting_Botnet_Command_and_Control_Channels_in_Network_Traffic","221655365_EXPOSURE_Finding_Malicious_Domains_Using_Passive_DNS_Analysis","220280440_Kwyjibo_Automatic_domain_name_generation"]}
