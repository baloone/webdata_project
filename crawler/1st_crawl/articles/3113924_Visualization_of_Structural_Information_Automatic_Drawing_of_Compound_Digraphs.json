{"id":"3113924_Visualization_of_Structural_Information_Automatic_Drawing_of_Compound_Digraphs","abstract":"An automatic method for drawing compound digraphs that contain\nboth inclusion edges and adjacency edges are presented. In the method\nvertices are drawn as rectangles (areas for texts, images, etc.),\ninclusion edges by the geometric inclusion among the rectangles, and\nadjacency edges by arrows connecting them. Readability elements such as\ndrawing conventions and rules are identified, and a heuristic algorithm\nto generate readable diagrams is developed. Several applications are\nshown to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm. The utilization\nof curves to improve the quality of diagrams is investigated. A possible\nset of command primitives for progressively organizing structures within\nthis graph formalism is discussed. The computational time for the\napplications shows that the algorithm achieves satisfactory performance","authors":["Kozo Sugiyama","Kazuo Misue"],"meta":["August 1991IEEE Transactions on Systems Man and Cybernetics 21(4):876 - 892","DOI:10.1109/21.108304","SourceIEEE Xplore"],"references":["2814662_DAG_-_A_Program_that_Draws_Directed_Graphs","295668423_STRUCTURING_INFORMATION_FOR_UNDERSTANDING_COMPLEX_SYSTEMS_A_BASIS_FOR_DECISION_MAKING","245575844_Automatic_layout_of_large_directed_graphs","243565227_A_Cognitive_approach_for_graph_drawing","227657136_A_Browser_for_Directed_Graphs","221054922_Good_graphic_interfaces_for_good_idea_organizers","220688555_The_Design_and_Analysis_Computer_Algorithms","220406838_The_NP-Completeness_Column_An_Ongoing_Guide","220406734_The_NP-Completeness_Column_An_Ongoing_Guide","220406368_The_NP-Completeness_Column_An_Ongoing_Guide","216632556_The_C_Programming_Language","3439280_Minimum_Feedback_Arc_and_Vertex_Sets_of_a_Directed_Graph","3116196_Crossing_Theory_and_Hierarchy_Mapping","3115111_Methods_for_Visual_Understanding_of_Hierarchical_Systems_Structure","3113722_Automatic_graph_drawing_and_readability_of_diagrams"]}
