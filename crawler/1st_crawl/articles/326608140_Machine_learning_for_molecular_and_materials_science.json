{"id":"326608140_Machine_learning_for_molecular_and_materials_science","abstract":"Here we summarize recent progress in machine learning for the chemical sciences. We outline machine-learning techniques that are suitable for addressing research questions in this domain, as well as future directions for the field. We envisage a future in which the design, synthesis, characterization and application of molecules and materials is accelerated by artificial intelligence.","authors":["Keith T. Butler","Daniel W.
