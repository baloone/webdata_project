{"id":"3498935_Object_recognition_in_visually_complex_environments_an_architecture_for_locating_address_blocks_on_mail_pieces","abstract":"A method of recognizing an object of interest in a complex visual\nenvironment is described. Motivated by the problem of finding the\ndestination address block on a piece of mail, a general framework for\ncoordinating a collection of specialized image analysis tools is\ndescribed. The resulting system can deal with a wide range of\nenvironments: from those having a high degree of global spatial\nstructure (e.g. mail envelopes which conform to specifications) to those\nwith no structure (e.g. magazines with randomly pasted address labels).\nThe problem-solving architecture accounts for uncertainty in the imaging\nenvironment by using the blackboard model. The system consists of\nseveral specialized tools and a control structure so that the tools are\nopportunistically invoked and coordinated. Its performance on an image\ndatabase of difficult cases is described","authors":["Wang Ching-Huei","P.W. Palumbo","S.N.
