{"id":"318316216_Core_Elements_in_the_Process_of_Citing_Publications_A_Conceptual_Overview_of_the_Literature","abstract":"This study provides an overview of the literature dealing with the process of citing publications (focusing on the literature from the recent decade). It presents theories, which have been proposed for explaining the citation process, and studies having empirically analyzed this process. The overview is structured based on three core elements in the citation process: the context of the cited document, processes from selection to citation of documents, and the context of the citing document. The overview can be used to understand the process of citing and delivers basic information for the proper application of citations in research evaluation.","authors":["Iman Tahamtan","Lutz Bornmann"],"meta":["July 2017Journal of Informetrics 12(1)","DOI:10.1016/j.joi.2018.01.002","Project: Core Elements in the Process of Citing Publications"],"references":["320344924_The_number_of_linked_references_of_publications_in_Microsoft_Academic_in_comparison_with_the_Web_of_Science","320296841_Characterizing_in-text_citations_in_scientific_articles_A_large-scale_analysis","315105670_The_coverage_of_Microsoft_Academic_Analyzing_the_publication_output_of_a_university","311652283_Toward_the_Discovery_of_Citation_Cartels_in_Citation_Networks","325673250_A_cognitive_model_of_document_use_during_a_research_project_Study_I_Document_selection","321877961_Citation_Analysis_in_Research_Evaluation","319642521_Applied_Evaluative_Informetrics","313285012_Prediction_and_explanation_in_social_systems","312446074_Citation_behavior_A_large-scale_test_of_the_persuasion_by_name-dropping_hypothesis","310593602_Discovering_discoveries_Identifying_biomedical_discoveries_using_citation_contexts"]}
