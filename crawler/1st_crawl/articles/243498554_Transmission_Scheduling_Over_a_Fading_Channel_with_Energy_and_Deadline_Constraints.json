{"id":"243498554_Transmission_Scheduling_Over_a_Fading_Channel_with_Energy_and_Deadline_Constraints","abstract":"We seek to maximize the data through- put of a power, energy, and time constrained trans- mitter sending data over a fading channel. The trans- mitter has a fixed amount of energy, a maximum power level, and a limited amount of time to send data. Given that the fade state, which is random, de- termines the throughput obtained per unit of energy expended, the goal is to obtain a policy for schedul- ing transmissions that maximizes the expected data throughput. We develop a dynamic programming for- mulation that leads to an optimal transmission sched- ule for channels with independently distributed fade states and also for channels whose fade states are Markov. This approach can be extended to the case of a transmitter seeking to minimize the energy re- quired to send a fixed amount of data over a fading channel given power and deadline constraints.","authors":["Alvin Fu","Eytan Modiano","John N.
