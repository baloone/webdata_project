{"id":"283280526_Quantum_information_cognition_and_music","abstract":"Parallelism represents an essential aspect of human mind/brain activities. One can recognize some common features between psychological parallelism and the characteristic parallel structures that arise in quantum theory and in quantum computation. The article is devoted to a discussion of the following questions:\na comparison between classical probabilistic Turing machines and quantum Turing machines.possible applications of the quantum computational semantics to cognitive problems.parallelism in music.","authors":["Maria Luisa Dalla Chiara","Roberto Giuntini","Roberto Leporini","Eleonora Negri"],"meta":["October 2015Frontiers in Psychology 6(1583)","DOI:10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01583"],"references":["235634008_Quantum_Entanglement_in_Concept_Combinations","228645472_Logics_from_quantum_computation","228575459_A_Theory_of_Concepts_and_Their_Combinations_II","301845147_Holistic_logical_arguments_in_quantum_computation","282490106_Quantum_Information_and_Music","266006917_Philosopie_der_Raum-Zeit-Lehre","257826684_Quantum_Automata_An_Overview","233820821_The_Feeling_of_What_Happens_Body_Emotion_and_the_Making_of_Consciousness","226147376_Entanglement_as_a_Semantic_Resource","220692229_Models_of_Computation_Exploring_the_Power_of_Computing"]}
