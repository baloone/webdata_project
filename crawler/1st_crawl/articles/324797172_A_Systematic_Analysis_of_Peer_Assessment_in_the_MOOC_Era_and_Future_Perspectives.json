{"id":"324797172_A_Systematic_Analysis_of_Peer_Assessment_in_the_MOOC_Era_and_Future_Perspectives","abstract":"Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs) have become a cost and time effective choice for learners all across the globe. This has led to new challenges for teachers such as providing valuable and quality assessment and feedback on such a large scale. Recent studies have found peer assessment where learners assess the work of their peers to be a viable and cost effective alternative to teacher/staff evaluation. This study systematically analyzes the current research on peer assessment published in the context of MOOCs and the online tools that are being used in MOOCs for peer assessment. 48 peer reviewed papers and 17 peer assessment tools were selected for the comparison in this study and were assessed on three main dimensions, namely, system design, efficiency and effectiveness. In the light of the comparison and discussion of current research in terms of these categories, we present future visions and research dimensions to improve the peer assessment process in MOOCs.","authors":["Usman Wahid","Mohamed Amine Chatti","Ulrik Schroeder"],"meta":["April 2016","Conference: eLmL 2016, The Eighth International Conference on Mobile, Hybrid, and On-line LearningAt: Venice, Italy"],"references":[]}
