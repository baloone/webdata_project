{"id":"286594602_Design_of_Unsupervised_Feature_Extraction_System_for_On-line_Bangla_Handwriting_Recognition","abstract":"Different systems for handwriting recognition use different features to represent the input text. Even after decades of research, no favorable decision on a best-practice exists and many features are carefully hand-crafted. To facilitate the design phase for on-line handwriting systems, in this paper, we propose an unsupervised feature generation approach based on dissimilarity space embedding (DSE) of local neighborhoods around the points along the trajectory. DSE has high capability of discriminative representation and hence beneficial for classification. We compare the approach with a state-of-the-art feature extraction method and demonstrate its superiority.","authors":["Volkmar Frinken","Nilanjana Bhattacharya","Umapada Pal"],"meta":["April 2014","DOI:10.1109/DAS.2014.55","Conference: 2014 11th IAPR International Workshop on Document Analysis Systems (DAS)","Project: Online Handwriting Recognition"],"references":["261499607_Learning-Based_Candidate_Segmentation_Scoring_for_Real-Time_Recognition_of_Online_Overlaid_Chinese_Handwriting","221389507_Graph_Similarity_Features_for_HMM-Based_Handwriting_Recognition_in_Historical_Documents","221389501_Online_Bangla_Word_Recognition_Using_Sub-Stroke_Level_Features_and_Hidden_Markov_Models","220181213_On-line_and_off-line_handwriting_recognition_a_comprehensive_survey_IEEE_Trans_Pattern_Anal_Mach_Intell_T-PAMI","24213728_A_Novel_Connectionist_System_for_Unconstrained_Handwriting_Recognition","266986861_The_dissimilarity_representation_for_pattern_recognition_Foundations_and_applications","261500198_Stroke_Segmentation_and_Recognition_from_Bangla_Online_Handwritten_Text","251520207_Towards_the_unification_of_structural_and_statistical_pattern_recognition","228989873_Novel_Hybrid_NNHMM_Modelling_Techniques_for_On-line_Handwriting_Recognition","224375219_A_new_HMM_for_on-line_character_recognition_using_pen-direction_and_pen-coordinate_features","220603807_Machine_recognition_of_handwritten_words_A_project_report","220359546_Graph_Classification_Based_on_Vector_Space_Embedding"]}
