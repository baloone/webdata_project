{"id":"324076363_Applied_Soft_Computing_A_Bibliometric_Analysis_of_the_Publications_and_Citations_during_2004-2016","abstract":"The Journal of Applied Soft Computing (ASOC) is a highly reputed journal in the field of engineering and computer science. This study reviews the ASOC publications during the period 2004â€“2016 which are indexed in the Web of Science (WoS). The motive behind this study is to reveal the main influencing aspects that govern the ASOC publications and its citation structure using scientometric methods The citation structure of the journal is analyzed first, which includes the distribution of citations over the years, citing sources and an aerial view of the citation structure. Then, the ASOC authorship is analyzed and the author co-citation network is displayed. Further, a country-wise temporal and quantitative analysis of the publications is given along with the highly cited documents among the ASOC publications. Document co-citation analysis is also performed to reveal the intellectual base of the ASOC publications.","authors":["Pranab K. Muhuri","Amit K.
