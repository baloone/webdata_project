This paper will present a possible way of how an eye tracker can be used with intelligent tutoring system to enhance learning experience of students. The task of an intelligent tutoring system discussed here is to recognize the degree of students effort when answering questions and then respond with appropriate feedback to motivate student.","authors":["Peter Lach"],"meta":["May 2013","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-38457-8_37","Conference: Canadian Conference on Artificial Intelligence"],"references":["225684113_Pupillary_dilation_as_a_measure_of_attention_A_quantitative_system_analysis","221517202_Task-evoked_pupillary_response_to_mental_workload_in_human-computer_interaction","220810969_Empathic_tutoring_software_agents_using_real-time_eye_tracking","26425465_Eye-Tracking_Adaptable_e-Learning_and_Content_Authoring_Support","268992454_Advances_in_Intelligent_Tutoring_Systems","257481863_Gaze_tutor_A_gaze-reactive_intelligent_tutoring_system","254007830_Measuring_cognitive_workload_across_different_eye_tracking_hardware_platforms","247707805_Experimentelle_Beitrage_zur_Lehre_von_den_katatonischen_Pupillenveranderungen","242609826_The_pupillary_response_to_mental_overload","228328574_Artificial_Intelligence_and_Tutoring_Systems","16128307_Processing_Load_and_the_Structure_of_Processing_Resources_Psychological_Bulletin_912_276-292","6006536_Pupil_Size_in_Relation_to_Mental_Activity_during_Simple_Problem-Solving","4352453_e5Learning_an_E-Learning_Environment_Based_on_Eye_Tracking","3973652_The_Index_of_Cognitive_Activity_Measuring_cognitive_workload"]}
