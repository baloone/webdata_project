On one hand, subjective quality evaluation offers the best representation of perceived video quality assessed by the real viewers. On the other hand, it consumes a significant amount of time and effort, due to the involvement of real users with lengthy and laborious assessment procedures. Thus, it is essential that an objective quality evaluation model is developed. The speed-up advantage offered by an objective quality evaluation model, which can predict the quality of rendered virtual views based on the depth maps used in the rendering process, allows for faster quality assessments for immersive video applications. This is particularly important given the lack of a suitable reference or ground truth for comparing the available depth maps, especially when live content services are offered in those applications. This paper presents a no-reference depth map quality evaluation model based on a proposed depth map edge confidence measurement technique to assist with accurately estimating the quality of rendered (virtual) views in immersive multi-view video content. The model is applied for depth image-based rendering in multi-view video format, providing comparable evaluation results to those existing in the literature, and often exceeding their performance.","authors":["Dogan","Haddad","Ekmekcioglu","Kondoz"],"meta":["September 2019Future Internet 11(10):204","DOI:10.3390/fi11100204"],"references":["329579423_Assessing_Visual_Quality_of_Omnidirectional_Videos","322193281_A_Study_on_Quality_Metrics_for_360_Video_Communications","320649118_Blind_Stereoscopic_Video_Quality_Assessment_From_Depth_Perception_to_Overall_Experience","305461363_Reduced-reference_video_quality_assessment_using_a_static_video_pattern","350441807_3DTV_Processing_and_Transmission_of_3D_Video_Signals","330816110_Reduced_Reference_Quality_Assessment_of_Light_Field_Images","321689369_NIQSV_A_No-Reference_Synthesized_View_Quality_Assessment_Metric","317308670_A_No-Reference_Optical_Flow-Based_Quality_Evaluator_for_Stereoscopic_Videos_in_Curvelet_Domain","313086331_A_Taxonomy_And_Evaluation_Of_Dense_Two-Frame_Stereo_Correspondence_Algorithms","310736232_Stereoscopic_Video_Quality_Assessment_Using_Binocular_Energy"]}
