{"id":"264218010_Supervision_Typology_in_Computer_Science_Engineering_Capstone_Projects","abstract":"Background: Undergraduate students in computer science engineering undertake a capstone project that should integrate the specific knowledge and skills acquired during their studies. The advisor assigned to supervise the process undertakes a multifaceted commitment that varies among advisors. Purpose: This study develops and validates an instrument, and then utilizes it to determine the different styles of supervision in computer science engineering capstone projects. DESIGN/METHOD: A questionnaire was developed to survey capstone project advisors at a university during the past two years. A total of 109 surveys were successfully collected. A combination of multivariate statistical methods, such as factorial and cluster analysis, was employed. Results: This study distinguished seven main supervision factors: technology, arrangements, keep alive, execution, meetings, management, and reports. Then, six supervision styles were identified according to the advisor's varying degree of involvement in each factor: student alone, execution focused, global supervision, management focused, technological mentoring, and process focused. To further characterize these styles, we compared their applications focusing on the type of student, the grade obtained, the project duration, and the amount of time devoted by the advisor. Conclusion: We have determined the main factors in capstone project supervision and characterized different styles of supervision according to these factors. These supervision styles can help advisors recognize ways to proceed in the supervision of capstone projects.","authors":["César Domínguez","Arturo Jaime","Francisco J.
