{"id":"272751964_A_Cut-Invariant_Law_of_Large_Numbers_for_Random_Heaps","abstract":"Heap monoids equipped with Bernoulli measures are a model of probabilistic\nasynchronous systems. We introduce in this framework the notion of asynchronous\nstopping time, which is analogous to the notion of stopping time for classical\nprobabilistic processes. A Strong Bernoulli property is proved. A notion of\ncut-invariance is formulated for convergent ergodic means. Then a version of\nthe Strong law of large numbers is proved for heap monoids with Bernoulli\nmeasures. Finally, we study a sub-additive version of the Law of large numbers\nin this framework based on Kingman sub-additive Ergodic Theorem.","authors":["Samy Abbes"],"meta":["December 2017Journal of Theoretical Probability 30(4)","DOI:10.1007/s10959-016-0692-6","SourcearXiv"],"references":["297497013_HEAPS_OF_PIECES_1_BASIC_DEFINITIONS_AND_COMBINATORIAL_LEMMAS","271512781_Probability_and_Measure","268861555_A_Course_in_Enumeration","267148160_Non-negative_matrices_and_Markov_chains_Revised_reprint_of_the_2nd_ed","267121150_Markov_Chains","265362002_Representation_theory_dynamical_systems_combinatorial_and_algorithmic_methods_III","264160660_Uniform_and_Bernoulli_measures_on_the_boundary_of_trace_monoids","263987984_APPROXIMATING_THE_MEAN_SPEEDUP_IN_TRACE_MONOIDS","259428462_Note_on_the_Smallest_Root_of_the_Independence_Polynomial","248782140_Heaps_of_pieces_I_Basic_denitions_and_combinatorial_lemmas","243770212_Problemes_Combinatoires_de_Commutation_et_Rearrangements","242504973_Markov_Chains_with_Stationary_Probabilities","242443041_Non-Negative_Matrices_and_Markov_Chains","238703390_Kingman's_subadditive_ergodic_theorem","227133681_The_Poisson-Furstenberg_Boundary_of_the_Locally_Free_Group"]}
