Spatially connected TMDC lateral heterojunctions are key components for constructing monolayer p-n rectifying diodes, light-emitting diodes, photovoltaic devices, and bipolar junction transistors. However, such structures are not readily prepared via the layer-stacking techniques, and direct growth favors the thermodynamically preferred TMDC alloys. We report the two-step epitaxial growth of lateral WSe2-MoS2 heterojunction, where the edge of WSe2 induces the epitaxial MoS2 growth despite a large lattice mismatch. The epitaxial growth process offers a controllable method to obtain lateral heterojunction with an atomically sharp interface.\nCopyright Â© 2015, American Association for the Advancement of Science.","authors":["Ming-Yang Li","Yumeng Shi","Chia-Chin Cheng","Li-Syuan Lu"],"meta":["July 2015Science 349(6247):524-528","DOI:10.1126/science.aab4097","SourcePubMed"],"references":["281438290_Determination_of_band_alignment_in_the_single-layer_MoS2WSe2_heterojunction","276366010_Large-area_synthesis_of_monolayer_WSe_2_on_a_SiO_2_Si_substrate_and_its_device_applications","272194009_Ultimate_Thin_Vertical_p-n_Junction_Composed_of_2D_Layered_Molybdenum_Disulfide","266253204_Lateral_epitaxial_growth_of_two-dimensional_layered_semiconductor_heterojunctions","266245581_Vertical_and_in-plane_heterostructures_from_WS2MoS2_monolayers","265735088_Air_Stable_p-Doping_of_WSe2_by_Covalent_Functionalization","326586264_Exceptional_Tunability_of_Band_Energy_in_Compressively_Strained_Tri-Layer_MoS2_Sheet","279045332_OPTICAL_2ND_HARMONIC-GENERATION_AT_INTERFACES","273481526_Transition_Metal_Chalcogenides_Ultrathin_Inorganic_Materials_with_Tunable_Electronic_Properties","272993648_Charge_Dynamics_and_Electronic_Structures_of_Monolayer_MoS_2_Films_Grown_by_Chemical_Vapor_Deposition"]}
