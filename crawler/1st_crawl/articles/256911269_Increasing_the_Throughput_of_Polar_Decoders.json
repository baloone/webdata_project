{"id":"256911269_Increasing_the_Throughput_of_Polar_Decoders","abstract":"The serial nature of successive-cancellation decoding results in low polar decoder throughput. In this letter we present an improved version of the simplified successive-cancellation decoding algorithm that increases decoding throughput without degrading the error-correction performance. We show that the proposed algorithm has up to three times the throughput of the simplified successive-cancellation decoding algorithm and up to twenty-nine times the throughput of a standard successive-cancellation decoder while using the same number of processing elements.","authors":["Gabi Sarkis","Warren J.
