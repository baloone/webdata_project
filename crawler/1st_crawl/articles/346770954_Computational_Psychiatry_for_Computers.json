{"id":"346770954_Computational_Psychiatry_for_Computers","abstract":"Computational psychiatry is a nascent field that attempts to use multi-level analyses of the underlying computational problems that we face in navigating a complex, uncertain and changing world to illuminate mental dysfunction and disease. Two particular foci of the field are the costs and benefits of environmental adaptivity and the danger and necessity of heuristics. Here, we examine the extent to which these foci and others can be used to study the actual and potential flaws of the artificial computational devices that we are increasingly inventing and empowering to navigate this very same environment on our behalf.","authors":["Eric Schulz","Peter Dayan"],"meta":["December 2020iScience 23(12):101772","DOI:10.1016/j.isci.2020.101772"],"references":["337538493_Towards_a_comparative_science_of_emotion_Affect_and_consciousness_in_humans_and_animals","334035816_From_choice_architecture_to_choice_engineering","332636704_Machine_behaviour","331460406_A_Theory_of_Fairness_Competition_and_Cooperation","330861887_Resource-rational_analysis_Understanding_human_cognition_as_the_optimal_use_of_limited_computational_resources","353676798_The_first_steps_on_long_marches_The_costs_of_active_observation","347755025_Analyzing_Machine-Learned_Representations_A_Natural_Language_Case_Study","337138541_Concepts_and_Dysfunctions_of_Emotion_in_Neuropsychiatric_Research","333573568_The_Microstructure_of_the_'Flash_Crash'_Flow_Toxicity_Liquidity_Crashes_and_the_Probability_of_Informed_Trading","329340759_When_planning_to_survive_goes_wrong_predicting_the_future_and_replaying_the_past_in_anxiety_and_PTSD"]}
