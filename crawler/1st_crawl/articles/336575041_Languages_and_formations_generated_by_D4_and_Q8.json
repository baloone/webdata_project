{"id":"336575041_Languages_and_formations_generated_by_D4_and_Q8","abstract":"We describe the two classes of languages recognized by the groups D4 and Q8, respectively. Then we show that the formations of languages generated by these two classes are the same. We also prove that these two formations are closed under inverses of morphisms, which yields a language theoretic proof of the fact that the group formations generated by D4 and Q8, respectively, are two equal varieties.","authors":["Jean-Eric Pin","Xaro Soler-Escriv√†"],"meta":["October 2019Theoretical Computer Science 800","DOI:10.1016/j.tcs.2019.10.023"],"references":["275685346_Languages_associated_with_saturated_formations_of_groups","242754342_Formations_of_finite_monoids_and_formal_languages_Eilenberg's_variety_theorem_revisited","265980614_On_finite_subformations_of_varieties_of_algebraic_systems","265898142_Subword_counting_and_nilpotent_groups","264859542_Advanced_Modern_Algebra","251221913_Kennzeichnung_gesttigter_Formationen","250603257_Product_of_formations_of_algebraic_systems","246162650_Families_of_recognizable_sets_corresponding_to_certain_varieties_of_finite_monoids","234798109_Varieties_Of_Formal_Languages","233360031_Formation_operators_on_classes_of_algebras"]}
