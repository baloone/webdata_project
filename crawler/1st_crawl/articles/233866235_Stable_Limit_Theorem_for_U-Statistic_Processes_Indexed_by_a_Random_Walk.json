{"id":"233866235_Stable_Limit_Theorem_for_U-Statistic_Processes_Indexed_by_a_Random_Walk","abstract":"Let (S_n)_{n\\in\\N} be a random walk in the domain of attraction of an\n$\\alpha$-stable L\\'evy process and (\\xi(n))_{n\\in\\N} a sequence of iid random\nvariables (called scenery). We want to investigate U-statistics indexed by the\nrandom walk S_n, that is U_n:=\\sum_{1\\leq i<j\\leq n}h(\\xi(S_i),\\xi(S_j)) for\nsome symmetric bivariate function h. We will prove the weak convergence without\nthe assumption of finite variance. Additionally, under the assumption of finite\nmoments of order greater than two, we will establish a law of the iterated\nlogarithm for the U-statistic U_n.","authors":["Brice Franke","Françoise Pène","Martin Wendler"],"meta":["December 2012","DOI:10.17877/DE290R-10365","SourcearXiv"],"references":["268245769_Limit_Theorems_for_Stochastic_Processes_with_Independent_Increments","266426023_Limit_Theorems_for_Stochastic_Processes","265682461_U-Statistics-Theory_and_Practice","259962879_Functional_limit_theorems_for_U-statistics_indexed_by_a_random_walk","227425244_Poisson_limits_for_U-statistics","227424943_A_law_of_the_iterated_logarithm_for_stable_processes_in_random_scenery","227423256_Functional_limit_theorems_for_U-statistics_indexed_by_a_random_walk","227107518_Strong_approximation_for_the_general_Resten-Spitzer_random_walk_in_independent_random_scenery","226477701_A_limit_theorem_related_to_a_new_class_of_self_similar_processes","226173269_A_law_of_the_iterated_logarithm_for_random_walk_in_random_scenery_with_deterministic_normalizers"]}
