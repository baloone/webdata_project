{"id":"328198328_Channel_changes_of_the_Adige_River_Eastern_Italian_Alps_over_the_last_1000_years_and_identification_of_the_historical_fluvial_corridor","abstract":"A 1:50,000-scale geomorphological map of the Adige/Etsch River valley bottom (NE Italy) is presented. The study area is 115 km long, and it extends between the city of Merano/Meran and the village of Calliano, including also the terminal segments of 9 major tributaries of the Adige River. Presently, the Adige shows a sinuous to straight morphology owing to massive channelization occurred during the 19th century. Fluvial geomorphological features have been mapped through a detailed-scale comparative multi-temporal analysis carried out on several historical maps dating since the 18th century, previous thematic maps, geological maps of the Italian “CARG” project, orthophotos (2011) and high – resolution DEM. \nThe map shows the active river channel, including bars and islands, dating to 1803-1805 (before channelization), to 1856-1861 (during channelization works) and under present conditions, as well as several paleo-channels dating up to the 13th century. The analysis led to define the corridor of historical channel changes, a fundamental tool for river management purposes (ecological restoration and flood hazard mitigation).","authors":["Vittoria Scorpio","Nicola Surian","maurizio Cucato","Elena Dai Prà"],"meta":["October 2018Journal of Maps 14(2)","DOI:10.1080/17445647.2018.1531074","Project: ETSCH- 2000- Evolution of the Etsch River: Historical changes in channel morphology over 2 millennia"],"references":["324991012_Long-term_temporal_trajectories_to_enhance_restoration_efficiency_and_sustainability_on_large_rivers_an_interdisciplinary_study","322012176_Guidebook_for_the_evaluation_of_stream_morphological_conditions_by_the_Morphological_Quality_Index_MQI","321423151_Channelization_of_a_large_alpine_river_What_is_left_of_its_original_morphodynamics","322764551_Biomorphodynamics_of_alternate_bars_in_a_channelized_regulated_river_An_integrated_historical_and_modelling_analysis","321762935_Morphology_of_fluvial_levee_series_along_a_river_under_human_influence_Maros_River_Hungary","318699069_Morphological_changes_in_Alpine_rivers_following_the_end_of_the_Little_Ice_Age","312418360_Patients'_Responsibilities_in_Medical_Ethics","310745503_Multidecadal_dynamics_of_alternate_bars_in_the_Alpine_Rhine_River","308130010_Channel_adjustments_in_a_Mediterranean_river_over_the_last_150years_in_the_context_of_anthropic_and_natural_controls","303688613_Who_Needs_Mitteleuropa_Old_Maps_Present-day_Applications_of_Habsburg_Cartographic_Heritage","282073535_A_multi-Scale_Hierarchical_Framework_for_Developing_Understanding_of_River_Behaviour_to_Support_River_management","281321324_Geomorphic_Mapping_and_Taxonomy_of_Fluvial_Landforms","291554450_Evolutionary_trajectory_of_channel_planforms_in_the_middle_Garonne_River_Toulouse_SW_France_over_a_130-year_period_Contribution_of_mixed_multiple_factor_analysis_MFAmix","289537330_Geomorphology_of_the_Lower_Calore_River_alluvial_plain_Southern_Italy","286143674_Working_with_change_The_importance_of_evolutionary_perspectives_in_framing_the_trajectory_of_river_adjustment"]}
