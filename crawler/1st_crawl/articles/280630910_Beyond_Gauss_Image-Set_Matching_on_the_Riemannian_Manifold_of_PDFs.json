{"id":"280630910_Beyond_Gauss_Image-Set_Matching_on_the_Riemannian_Manifold_of_PDFs","abstract":"State-of-the-art image-set matching techniques typically implicitly model\neach image-set with a Gaussian distribution. Here, we propose to go beyond\nthese representations and model image-sets as probability distribution\nfunctions (PDFs) using kernel density estimators. To compare and match\nimage-sets, we exploit Csiszar f-divergences, which bear strong connections to\nthe geodesic distance defined on the space of PDFs, i.e., the statistical\nmanifold. Furthermore, we introduce valid positive definite kernels on the\nstatistical manifolds, which let us make use of more powerful classification\nschemes to match image-sets. Finally, we introduce a supervised dimensionality\nreduction technique that learns a latent space where f-divergences reflect the\nclass labels of the data. Our experiments on diverse problems, such as\nvideo-based face recognition and dynamic texture classification, evidence the\nbenefits of our approach over the state-of-the-art image-set matching methods.","authors":["Mehrtash T.
