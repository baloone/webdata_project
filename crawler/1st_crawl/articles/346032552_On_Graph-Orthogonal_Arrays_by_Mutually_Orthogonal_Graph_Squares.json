{"id":"346032552_On_Graph-Orthogonal_Arrays_by_Mutually_Orthogonal_Graph_Squares","abstract":"During the last two centuries, after the question asked by Euler concerning mutually orthogonal Latin squares (MOLS), essential advances have been made. MOLS are considered as a construction tool for orthogonal arrays. Although Latin squares have numerous helpful properties, for some factual applications these structures are excessively prohibitive. The more general concepts of graph squares and mutually orthogonal graph squares (MOGS) offer more flexibility. MOGS generalize MOLS in an interesting way. As such, the topic is attractive. Orthogonal arrays are essential in statistics and are related to finite fields, geometry, combinatorics and error-correcting codes. Furthermore, they are used in cryptography and computer science. In this paper, our current efforts have concentrated on the definition of the graph-orthogonal arrays and on proving that if there are k MOGS of order n, then there is a graph-orthogonal array, and we denote this array by G-OA(n2,k,n,2). In addition, several new results for the orthogonal arrays obtained from the MOGS are given. Furthermore, we introduce a recursive construction method for constructing the graph-orthogonal arrays.","authors":["Mahmoud Higazy","Ahmed El-Mesady","Mohamed S.
