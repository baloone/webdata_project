{"id":"341169147_A_Metamodel_Based_on_Non-Uniform_Rational_Basis_Spline_Hyper-Surfaces_for_Optimisation_of_Composite_Structures","abstract":"This study presents a new strategy to generate a surrogate model used for design purposes. The metamodel is based on Non-Uniform Rational Basis Spline (NURBS) hyper-surfaces and is able to fit non-convex sets of target points (TPs). The proposed method aims at determining all the parameters involved in the definition of the NURBS hyper-surface, i.e. control points (CPs) coordinates, weights, degrees, CPs number and knot-vector components. To this purpose, the problem of finding a suitable metamodel is formulated as a constrained non-linear programming problem (CNLPP) wherein the above variables are optimised in order to fit a set of TPs. Nevertheless, when the number of CPs and the degrees of the basis functions are included among the design variables, the resulting problem is defined over a space having a variable dimension. This problem is solved by means of a special genetic algorithm able to determine simultaneously the optimum value of both the design space size (related to the integer variables of the NURBS hyper-surface) and the NURBS hyper-surface continuous parameters. The NURBS-based metamodel is then used to emulate the first buckling load of a composite stiffened panel and it is used in the framework of a meaningful design problem.","authors":["Yohann Audoux","Marco Montemurro","Jérôme Pailhès"],"meta":["May 2020Composite Structures 247(4):112439","DOI:10.1016/j.compstruct.2020.112439"],"references":["338148682_Structural_Displacement_Requirement_in_a_Topology_Optimization_Algorithm_Based_on_Isogeometric_Entities","334439609_Multi-scale_identification_of_the_elastic_properties_variability_for_composite_materials_through_a_hybrid_optimisation_strategy","333468754_Minimum_length_scale_control_in_a_NURBS-based_SIMP_method","333270350_Multi-scale_shape_optimisation_of_lattice_structures_an_evolutionary-based_approach","333164621_NURBS_hyper-surfaces_for_3D_topology_optimization_problems","333087114_Maximum_length_scale_requirement_in_a_topology_optimisation_method_based_on_NURBS_hyper-surfaces","332072739_Blending_constraints_for_composite_laminates_in_polar_parameters_space","330442520_Least-weight_composite_plates_with_unconventional_stacking_sequences_Design_analysis_and_experiments","328556863_A_general_B-Spline_surfaces_theoretical_framework_for_optimisation_of_variable_angle-tow_laminates","326859229_Characterisation_of_composite_elastic_properties_by_means_of_a_multi-scale_two-level_inverse_approach","326147445_A_general_multi-scale_two-level_optimisation_strategy_for_designing_composite_stiffened_panels","325277382_A_surrogate_model_based_on_Non-Uniform_Rational_B-Splines_hypersurfaces","321268212_A_2D_Topology_Optimisation_algorithm_in_NURBS_framework_with_geometric_constraints","321026025_A_General_Hybrid_Optimization_Strategy_for_Curve_Fitting_in_the_Non-Uniform_Rational_Basis_Spline_Framework","309785612_On_the_effective_integration_of_manufacturability_constraints_within_the_multi-scale_methodology_for_designing_variable_angle-tow_laminates","237453504_Review_of_Metamodeling_Techniques_in_Support_of_Engineering_Design_Optimization","234151059_The_Proper_Orthogonal_Decomposition_in_the_Analysis_of_Turbulent_Flows","200744645_A_Practical_Guide_to_Spline","29619565_Radial_Basis_Functions_and_Kriging_Metamodels_for_Aerodynamic_Optimization","339539587_Non-Uniform_Rational_Basis_Spline_hyper-surfaces_for_metamodelling","321526241_Monographs_in_Visual_Communications","311954557_A_New_Paradigm_for_the_Optimum_Design_of_Variable_Angle_Tow_Laminates","302467610_Radial_Basis_Functions","292124145_A_statistical_approach_to_some_basic_mine_valuation_problems_on_the_Witwatersrand","291557023_A_Kriging_surrogate_model_coupled_in_simulation-optimization_approach_for_identifying_release_history_of_groundwater_sources","290391370_Inverse_characterization_of_composite_materials_via_surrogate_modeling","279568114_Corrigendum_to_An_extension_of_the_polar_method_to_the_First-order_Shear_Deformation_Theory_of_laminates_Compos_Struct_127_2015_328-339","278619852_The_polar_analysis_of_the_Third-order_Shear_Deformation_Theory_of_laminates","274509771_An_extension_of_the_Polar_Method_to_the_First-order_Shear_Deformation_Theory_of_laminates","255613988_An_introduction_to_the_proper_orthogonal_decomposition","242934729_N-Dimensional_Nonuniform_Rational_B-Splines_for_Metamodeling","225800734_Plane_Anisotropy_by_the_Polar_Method","225535365_Optimization_of_injection_molding_process_parameters_using_integrated_artificial_neural_network_model_and_expected_improvement_function_method","223445740_Post-buckling_optimisation_of_composite_stiffened_panels_using_neural_networks","216301386_Flexibility_and_Efficiency_Enhancements_For_Constrainted_Global_Design_Optimization_with_Kriging_Approximations","37256806_HyPerModels_hyperdimensional_performance_models_for_engineering_design","2605983_Aircraft_Multidisciplinary_Design_Optimization_Using_Design_Of_Experiments_Theory_And_Response_Surface_Modeling_Methods"]}
