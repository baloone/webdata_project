{"id":"343635292_Applications_of_Topology_in_Science_and_Technology","abstract":"Topology being somehow very recent in nature but has got tremendous applications over almost all other fields. Theoretical or fundamental topology is a bit dry but the application part is what drives crazy once we get used. In this paper we discuss some applications in various fields of Science and Technology, like applications to Biology, Robotics, GIS, Engineering, Computer Sciences. Topology though being a part of mathematics but it has influenced the whole world with so strong effects and incredible applications.","authors":["S Mishra","Mir Aaliya"],"meta":["December 2018","Project: Applications of Topology in Science and Technology"],"references":["276959705_Point_Set_Topological_Spatial_Relations","16342251_Sudden_Cardiac_Death_A_Problem_in_Topology"]}
