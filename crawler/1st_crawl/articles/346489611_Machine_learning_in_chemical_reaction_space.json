{"id":"346489611_Machine_learning_in_chemical_reaction_space","abstract":"Chemical compound space refers to the vast set of all possible chemical compounds, estimated to contain 10⁶⁰ molecules. While intractable as a whole, modern machine learning (ML) is increasingly capable of accurately predicting molecular properties in important subsets. Here, we therefore engage in the ML-driven study of even larger reaction space. Central to chemistry as a science of transformations, this space contains all possible chemical reactions. As an important basis for ‘reactive’ ML, we establish a first-principles database (Rad-6) containing closed and open-shell organic molecules, along with an associated database of chemical reaction energies (Rad-6-RE). We show that the special topology of reaction spaces, with central hub molecules involved in multiple reactions, requires a modification of existing compound space ML-concepts. Showcased by the application to methane combustion, we demonstrate that the learned reaction energies offer a non-empirical route to rationally extract reduced reaction networks for detailed microkinetic analyses.","authors":["Sina Stocker","Gábor Csányi","Karsten Reuter","Johannes T Margraf"],"meta":["October 2020Nature Communications 11(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41467-020-19267-x"],"references":["343670038_Mapping_Materials_and_Molecules","339335839_Atomic_structures_and_orbital_energies_of_61489_crystal-forming_organic_molecules","338498683_A_Performance_and_Cost_Assessment_of_Machine_Learning_Interatomic_Potentials","337137388_Comprehensive_kinetic_study_of_combustion_technologies_for_low_environmental_impact_MILD_and_OXY-fuel_combustion_of_methane","339707071_Noncovalent_Quantum_Machine_Learning_Corrections_to_Density_Functionals","339244269_Optimization_of_Global_Reaction_Mechanism_for_MILD_Combustion_of_Methane_Using_Artificial_Neural_Network_ANN","339035596_Size-Extensive_Molecular_Machine_Learning_with_Global_Representations","335133465_Chemical_Reaction_Mechanisms_Assessment_for_Simulation_of_Methane_Combustion_in_Domestic_Gas_Cooking_Burners","334840255_Initial-stage_reaction_of_methane_examined_by_optical_measurements_of_weak_flames_in_a_micro_flow_reactor_with_a_controlled_temperature_profile","333987964_First-principles-based_multiscale_modelling_of_heterogeneous_catalysis"]}
