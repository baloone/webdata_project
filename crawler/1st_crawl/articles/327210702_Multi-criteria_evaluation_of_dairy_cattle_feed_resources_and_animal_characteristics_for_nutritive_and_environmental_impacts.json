{"id":"327210702_Multi-criteria_evaluation_of_dairy_cattle_feed_resources_and_animal_characteristics_for_nutritive_and_environmental_impacts","abstract":"On-farm nutrition and management interventions to reduce enteric CH4 (eCH4 ) emission, the most abundant greenhouse gas from cattle, may also affect volatile solids and N excretion. The objective was to jointly quantify eCH4 emissions, digestible volatile solids (dVS) excretion and N excretion from dairy cattle, based on dietary variables and animal characteristics, and to evaluate relationships between these emissions and excreta. Univariate and Bayesian multivariate mixed-effects models fitted to 520 individual North American dairy cow records indicated dry matter (DM) intake and dietary ADF and CP to be the main predictors for production of eCH4 emissions and dVS and N excreta (g/day). Yields (g/kg DM intake) of eCH4 emissions and dVS and N excreta were best predicted by dietary ADF, dietary CP, milk yield and milk fat content. Intensities (g/kg fat- and protein-corrected milk) of eCH4 , dVS and N excreta were best predicted by dietary ADF, dietary CP, days in milk and BW. A K -fold cross-validation indicated that eCH4 and urinary N variables had larger root mean square prediction error (RMSPE; % of observed mean) than dVS, fecal N and total N production (on average 24.3% and 26.5% v . 16.7%, 15.5% and 16.2%, respectively), whereas intensity variables had larger RMSPE than production and yields (29.4%, 14.7% and 14.6%, respectively). Univariate and multivariate equations performed relatively similar (18.8% v. 19.3% RMSPE). Mutual correlations indicated a trade-off for eCH4 v. dVS yield. The multivariate model indicated a trade-off between eCH4 and dVS v. total N production, yield and intensity induced by dietary CP content.","authors":["Henk van Lingen","James G Fadel","Andre Bannink","Jan Dijkstra"],"meta":["December 2018animal 12(S2):s310-s320","DOI:10.1017/S1751731118001313"],"references":["318077491_Effects_of_grass_silage_quality_and_level_of_feed_intake_on_enteric_methane_production_in_lactating_dairy_cows","293799789_Effects_of_ruminal_digesta_retention_time_on_methane_emissions_a_modelling_approach","347571960_CRC_Standard_Probability_and_Statistics_Tables_and_Formulae","320835204_Predicting_manure_volatile_solid_output_of_lactating_dairy_cows","318392848_An_Introduction_to_Statistical_Learning_With_Applications_in_R","314725324_Prediction_and_Improved_Estimation_in_Linear_Models","305518321_Meta-analysis_of_postruminal_microbial_nitrogen_flows_in_dairy_cattle_I_Derivation_of_equations","284046833_Bayesian_measures_of_model_complexity_and_fit_with_discussion","268656093_Prediction_and_Improved_Estimation_in_Linear_Models","266364341_CRC_Standard_Probability_and_Statistics_Tables_and_Formulae"]}
