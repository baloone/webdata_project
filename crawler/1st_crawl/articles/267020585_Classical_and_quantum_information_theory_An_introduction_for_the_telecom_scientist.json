{"id":"267020585_Classical_and_quantum_information_theory_An_introduction_for_the_telecom_scientist","abstract":"Information theory lies at the heart of modern technology, underpinning all communications, networking, and data storage systems. This book sets out, for the first time, a complete overview of both classical and quantum information theory. Throughout, the reader is introduced to key results without becoming lost in mathematical details. Opening chapters present the basic concepts and various applications of Shannonâ€™s entropy, moving on to the core features of quantum information and quantum computing. Topics such as coding, compression, error-correction, cryptography and channel capacity are covered from classical and quantum viewpoints. Employing an informal yet scientifically accurate approach, Desurvire provides the reader with the knowledge to understand quantum gates and circuits. Highly illustrated, with numerous practical examples and end-of-chapter exercises, this text is ideal for graduate students and researchers in electrical engineering and computer science, and practitioners in the telecommunications industry.
