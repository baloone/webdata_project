{"id":"282764706_Oxford_Nanopore_sequencing_hybrid_error_correction_and_de_novo_assembly_of_a_eukaryotic_genome","abstract":"Monitoring the progress of DNA molecules through a membrane pore has been postulated as a method for sequencing DNA for several decades. Recently, a nanopore-based sequencing instrument, the Oxford Nanopore MinION, has become available, and we used this for sequencing the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome. To make use of these data, we developed a novel open-source hybrid error correction algorithm Nanocorr specifically for Oxford Nanopore reads, because existing packages were incapable of assembling the long read lengths (5-50 kbp) at such high error rates (between âˆ¼5% and 40% error). With this new method, we were able to perform a hybrid error correction of the nanopore reads using complementary MiSeq data and produce a de novo assembly that is highly contiguous and accurate: The contig N50 length is more than ten times greater than an Illumina-only assembly (678 kb versus 59.9 kbp) and has >99.88% consensus identity when compared to the reference. Furthermore, the assembly with the long nanopore reads presents a much more complete representation of the features of the genome and correctly assembles gene cassettes, rRNAs, transposable elements, and other genomic features that were almost entirely absent in the Illumina-only assembly.","authors":["Sara Goodwin","James Gurtowski","Scott Ethe-Sayers","Panchajanya Deshpande"],"meta":["October 2015Genome Research 25(11)","DOI:10.1101/gr.191395.115","Project: Oxford Nanopore evaluation and applications"],"references":["344854848_Error_correction_and_assembly_complexity_of_single_molecule_sequencing_reads","268787566_Pilon_An_Integrated_Tool_for_Comprehensive_Microbial_Variant_Detection_and_Genome_Assembly_Improvement","268235015_Erratum_A_reference_bacterial_genome_dataset_generated_on_the_MinIONTM_portable_single-molecule_nanopore_sequencer","264987907_Poretools_A_toolkit_for_analyzing_nanopore_sequence_data","258117581_Error_rates_for_nanopore_discrimination_among_cytosine_methylcytosine_and_hydroxymethylcytosine_along_individual_DNA_strands","236638581_Nonhybrid_finished_microbial_genome_assemblies_from_long-read_SMRT_sequencing_data","228102549_Hybrid_error_correction_de_novo_assembly_of_single-molecule_sequencing_reads","268154746_Resolving_the_complexity_of_the_human_genome_using_single-molecule_sequencing","254259148_Advances_in_Nanopore_Sequencing_Technology","223972726_Oxford_Nanopore_announcement_sets_sequencing_sector_abuzz"]}
