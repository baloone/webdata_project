{"id":"281448467_Location_Based_Protocols_in_Wireless_Sensor_Network_-_A_Review","abstract":"Location based routing protocols are used in Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) in which the information about the location of nodes is used for communication. It is also known as geographic routing protocol or position based routing protocols. These protocols reduce the energy consumption and increase the lifetime of the network. This paper gives an explanation about location based routing and also analysis some important location based routing protocols Geographical and Energy Aware Routing (GEAR), Geographic Adaptive Fidelity (GAF) and Minimum Energy Communication Network (MECN) in detail. For better understanding, the comparison between these protocols is shown.","authors":["Jitender Grover","Shikha Sharma","Mohit Sharma"],"meta":["July 2014","DOI:10.1109/ICCCNT.2014.6962990","Conference: IEEE Fifth International Conference on Computing, Communications and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT 2014)At: Hefei, Anhui, China","Project: Wireless Sensor Network implementation"],"references":["291586442_A_Study_On_Energy_Efficient_Routing_Protocols_In_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","272854907_Geographic_Load_Balanced_Routing_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","268302567_Surveying_Position_Based_Routing_Protocols_for_Wireless_Sensor_and_Ad-hoc_Networks","266486225_Geographic_Adaptive_Fidelity_and_Geographic_Energy_Aware_Routing_in_Ad_Hoc_Routing_Geographic_Adaptive_Fidelity_and_Geographic_Energy_Aware_Routing_in_Ad_Hoc_Routing","265802222_A_Study_On_Energy_Efficient_Routing_Protocols_In_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","232143907_A_Review_on_Routing_Protocols_for_Application_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","51872960_A_Comparative_Study_of_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_and_Their_Routing_Protocols","49589922_Routing_Protocols_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_-_A_Survey","323850739_Various_Routing_Protocols_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","289766621_A_Review_on_Routing_Protocols_for_Application_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","288157615_Performance_analysis_of_geographic_routing_protocols_in_highly_Mobile_Ad_Hoc_network","2380817_Geographical_and_Energy_Aware_Routing_a_recursive_data_dissemination_protocol_for_wireless_sensor_networks"]}
