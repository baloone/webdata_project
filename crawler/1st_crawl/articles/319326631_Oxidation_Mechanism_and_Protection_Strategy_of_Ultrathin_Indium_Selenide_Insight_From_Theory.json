{"id":"319326631_Oxidation_Mechanism_and_Protection_Strategy_of_Ultrathin_Indium_Selenide_Insight_From_Theory","abstract":"Ultrathin indium selenide (InSe), as a newly emerging two-dimensional material with high carrier mobility and broad absorption spectrum, has been the focus of current research. However, the long-term environmental instability of atomically thin InSe seriously limits its practical applications. To develop effective strategy to protect InSe, it is crucial to reveal the degradation mechanism at atomic level. By employing density functional theory and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, we provide an in-depth understanding of oxidation mechanism of InSe. The defect-free InSe presents excellent stability against oxidation. Nevertheless, the Se vacancies on the surface can react with water and oxygen in air directly, and activate the neighboring In-Se bonds on the basal plane for further oxidation, leading to complete degradation of InSe into oxidation products of In2O3 and elemental Se. Furthermore, we propose an efficient strategy to repair the Se vacancies by thiol chemistry. In this way, the repaired surface can resist oxidation from oxygen and retains original high electron mobility of pristine InSe simultaneously.","authors":["Li Shi","QiongHua Zhou","Yinghe Zhao","Yixin Ouyang"],"meta":["August 2017Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters 8(18)","DOI:10.1021/acs.jpclett.7b02059","Project: 2D materials"],"references":["314307595_Engineering_p-n_junctions_and_bandgap_tuning_of_InSe_nanolayers_by_controlled_oxidation","307536458_High_Electron_Mobility_Quantum_Hall_Effect_and_Anomalous_Optical_Response_in_Atomically_Thin_InSe","301320003_Nanotexturing_To_Enhance_Photoluminescent_Response_of_Atomically_Thin_Indium_Selenide_with_Highly_Tunable_Band_Gap","299359155_The_influence_of_chemical_reactivity_of_surface_defects_on_ambient-stable_InSe-based_nanodevices","291437036_Repairing_atomic_vacancies_in_single-layer_MoSe2_field-effect_transistor_and_its_defect_dynamics","277143781_Photooxidation_and_quantum_confinement_effects_in_exfoliated_black_phosphorus","276850708_High_Broad-Band_Photoresponsivity_of_Mechanically_Formed_InSe-Graphene_van_der_Waals_Heterostructures","273159655_A_high_performance_graphenefew-layer_InSe_photo-detector","265169208_Towards_Intrinsic_Charge_Transport_in_Monolayer_Molybdenum_Disulfide_by_Defect_and_Interface_Engineering","260910755_Electrons_and_phonons_in_single_layers_of_hexagonal_indium_chalcogenides_from_ab_initio_calculations","258036108_Hopping_transport_through_defect-induced_localized_states_in_molybdenum_disulphide","236103584_Photoelectrical_properties_and_the_electronic_structure_of_Tl1-xIn1-xSnxSe2_x_0_01_02_025_single_crystalline_alloys","225188263_Efficient_Iterative_Schemes_for_Ab_Initio_Total-Energy_Calculations_Using_a_Plane-Wave_Basis_Set","224877263_A_Climbing_Image_Nudged_Elastic_Band_Method_for_Finding_Saddle_Points_and_Minimum_Energy_Paths","201877759_From_Ultrasoft_Pseudopotentials_to_the_Projector_Augmented-Wave_Method","13287839_Atoms_Molecules_Solids_and_Surfaces_Applications_of_the_Generalized_Gradient_Approximation_for_Exchange_and_Correlation","316985528_Defects_and_oxidation_resilience_in_chInSe","316896932_Ambient_Protection_of_Few-Layer_Black_Phosphorus_via_Sequestration_of_Reactive_Oxygen_Species","306248762_Light-Induced_Ambient_Degradation_of_Few-Layer_Black_Phosphorus_Mechanism_and_Protection","303597518_Activating_Inert_Basal_Planes_of_MoS2_for_Hydrogen_Evolution_Reaction_through_the_Formation_of_Different_Intrinsic_Defects","292678939_Surface_functionalization_of_two-dimensional_metal_chalcogenides_by_Lewis_acid-base_chemistry","280115045_Two_Dimensional_Indium_Selenides_Compounds_An_Ab-Initio_Study","275669153_Intrinsic_Electron_Mobility_Exceeding_1000_cm2_V_s_in_Multilayer_InSe_FETs","269699130_Optoelectronic_Memory_Using_Two-Dimensional_Materials","265130802_Back_Gated_Multilayer_InSe_Transistors_with_Enhanced_Carrier_Mobilities_via_the_Suppression_of_Carrier_Scattering_from_a_Dielectric_Interface","259605485_Evolution_of_the_Electronic_Band_Structure_and_Efficient_Photo-Detection_in_Atomic_Layers_of_InSe","258500984_Optical_Spectra_and_Band_Structure_of_AgxGaxGe1-xSe2_x0333_0250_0200_0167_Single_Crystals_Experiment_and_Theory","258053899_Linear_Nonlinear_Optical_Susceptibilities_and_the_Hyperpolarizability_of_Borate_LiBaB9O15_Single-Crystal_Theory_and_Experiment","256213393_Defect_control_of_hydrogenation_activity_of_molybdenum_sulfide_catalyst","251391987_Determination_of_the_rate_constants_for_the_reaction_Fe_O_2_FeO_O_in_the_forward_and_reverse_directions","235596453_Density_functional_study_of_CO_on_Rh111","231677276_Ethanethiol_Decomposition_Pathways_on_MoS20001","231664620_Methanethiol_Adsorption_on_Defective_MoS20001_Surfaces","231400216_Dioxygen_complexes_of_3d_transition-metal_atoms_Formation_reactions_in_the_gas_phase","230630163_Hybrid_Functional_Based_on_a_Screened_Coulomb_Potential","230630016_Projector_Agmented-Wave_Method","224916441_Localized_Reaction_at_a_Smooth_Metal_Surface_p-Diiodobenzene_at_Cu110","223347756_QUICKSTEP_Fast_and_accurate_density_functional_calculations_using_a_mixed_Gaussian_and_plane_waves_approach","223245351_Characteristics_of_phase_formation_during_indium_selenides_oxidation","222623008_Thermal_oxidation_of_cleft_surface_of_InSe_single_crystal","13288875_Accurate_and_Simple_Analytic_Representation_of_the_Electron-Gas_Correlation_Energy","6835669_Semiempirical_GGA-Type_Density_Functional_Constructed_with_a_Long-Range_Dispersion_Correction"]}
