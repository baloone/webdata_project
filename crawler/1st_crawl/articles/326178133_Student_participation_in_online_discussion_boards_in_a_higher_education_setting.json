{"id":"326178133_Student_participation_in_online_discussion_boards_in_a_higher_education_setting","abstract":"To understand more about how learning takes place online, this study describes and analyzes the micro-level features of the online discussions of students in a college course. A positive relationship between online participation and student performance was found, in which higher-graded students submitted more messages and engaged in more interaction with their classmates via the online discussion board. Four online participation approaches were determined, and it was found that students categorized as starters and responders tended to receive higher grades than activators and latecomers. Opening questions were placed into one of four categories: invitation, exploration, concept invention, and application. A summary matrix outlining the features of resulting discussions alongside learning outcomes and educator goals is provided. Â© 2018, Association for the Advancement of Computing in Education.
