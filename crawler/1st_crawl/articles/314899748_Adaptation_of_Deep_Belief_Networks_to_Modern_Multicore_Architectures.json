{"id":"314899748_Adaptation_of_Deep_Belief_Networks_to_Modern_Multicore_Architectures","abstract":"In our previous paper [17], the parallel realization of Restricted Boltzman Machines (RBMs) was discussed. This research confirmed a potential usefulness of Intel MIC parallel architecture for implementation of RBMs. In this work, we investigate how the Intel MIC and Intel CPU architectures can be applied to implement the complete learning process using Deep Belief Networks (DBNs), which layers correspond to RBMs. The learning procedure is based on the matrix approach, where learning samples are grouped into packages, and represented as matrices. This approach is now applied for both the initial learning, and fine-tuning stages of learning. The influence of the package size on the accuracy of learning, as well as on the performance of computations are studied using conventional CPU and Intel Xeon Phi architectures.","authors":["Tomasz Olas","Wojciech K.
