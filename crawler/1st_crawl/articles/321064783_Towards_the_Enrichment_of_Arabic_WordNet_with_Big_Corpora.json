{"id":"321064783_Towards_the_Enrichment_of_Arabic_WordNet_with_Big_Corpora","abstract":"This paper presents a method aiming to enrich Arabic WordNet with semantic clusters extracted from a large general corpus. The Arabic language being poor in open digital linguistic resources, we built such a corpus (more than 7.5 billion words) with ad-hoc tools. We then applied GraPaVec, a new method for word vectorization using automatically generated frequency patterns, as well as state-of-the-art Word2Vec and Glove methods. Word vectors were fed to a Self Organizing Map neural network model; the clusterings produced were then compared for evaluation with Arabic WordNet existing synsets (sets of synonymous words). The evaluation yields a F-score of 82.1% for GrapaVec, 55.1% for Word2Vecâ€™s Skipgram, 52.2% for CBOW and\n56.6% for Glove, which at least shows the interest of the context that GraPaVec takes into account. We end up by discussing parameters and possible biases.","authors":["George Lebbos","Gilles Bernard","Nourredine Aliane","Mohammad Hajjar"],"meta":["January 2017","DOI:10.5220/0006505701010109","Conference: 9th International Joint Conference on Computational Intelligence"],"references":[]}
