{"id":"307874259_A_novel_Clustering_based_Genetic_Algorithm_for_route_optimization","abstract":"Genetic Algorithm (GA), a random universal evolutionary search technique that imitates the principle of biological evolution has been applied in solving various problems in different fields of human endeavor. Despite it strength and wide range of applications, optimal solution may not be feasible in situations where reproduction processes which involve chromosomes selection for mating and regeneration are not properly done. In addition, difficulty is often encountered when there are significant differences in the fitness values of chromosomes while using probabilistic based selection approach.","authors":["A. M.
