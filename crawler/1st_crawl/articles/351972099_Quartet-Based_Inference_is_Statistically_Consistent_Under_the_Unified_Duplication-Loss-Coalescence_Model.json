{"id":"351972099_Quartet-Based_Inference_is_Statistically_Consistent_Under_the_Unified_Duplication-Loss-Coalescence_Model","abstract":"Motivation: \nThe classic multispecies coalescent (MSC) model provides the means for theoretical justification of incomplete lineage sorting-aware species tree inference methods. This has motivated an extensive body of work on phylogenetic methods that are statistically consistent under MSC. One such particularly popular method is ASTRAL, a quartet-based species tree inference method. Novel studies suggest that ASTRAL also performs well when given multi-locus gene trees in simulation studies. Further, Legried et al. recently demonstrated that ASTRAL is statistically consistent under the gene duplication and loss model (GDL). GDL is prevalent in evolutionary histories and is the first core process in the powerful duplication-loss-coalescence evolutionary model (DLCoal) by Rasmussen and Kellis.\n\nResults: \nIn this work we prove that ASTRAL is statistically consistent under the general DLCoal model. Therefore, our result supports the empirical evidence from the simulation-based studies. More broadly, we prove that the quartet-based inference approach is statistically consistent under DLCoal.","authors":["Alexey Markin","Oliver Eulenstein"],"meta":["May 2021Bioinformatics","DOI:10.1093/bioinformatics/btab414"],"references":["325017725_ASTRAL-III_Polynomial_time_species_tree_reconstruction_from_partially_resolved_gene_trees","316163552_Split_Probabilities_and_Species_Tree_Inference_Under_the_Multispecies_Coalescent_Model","283005517_ASTRID_Accurate_species_TRees_from_internode_distances","221772269_Unified_Modeling_of_Gene_Duplication_Loss_and_Coalescence_Using_a_Locus_Tree","50907071_Estimating_Species_Trees_from_Unrooted_Gene_Trees","47394925_A_maximum_pseudo-likelihood_approach_forestimating_species_trees_under_the_coalescent","45283663_Identifying_the_Rooted_Species_Tree_from_the_Distribution_of_Unrooted_Gene_Trees_under_the_Coalescent","44651578_Estimating_Species_Phylogenies_Using_Coalescence_Times_Among_Sequences","44651545_Properties_of_Consensus_Methods_for_Inferring_Species_Trees_from_Gene_Trees","41425088_Incomplete_Lineage_Sorting_Consistent_Phylogeny_Estimation_From_Multiple_Loci","24002667_Kubatko_LS_Carstens_BC_Knowles_LL_STEM_species_tree_estimation_using_maximum_likelihood_for_gene_trees_under_coalescence_Bioinformatics_25_971-973","10603439_Bayes_Estimation_of_Species_Divergence_Times_and_Ancestral_Population_Sizes_Using_DNA_Sequences_From_Multiple_Loci","5414208_Rooted_triple_consensus_and_anomalous_gene_trees","342986403_Inferring_Metric_Trees_from_Weighted_Quartets_via_an_Intertaxon_Distance","340800700_Polynomial-Time_Statistical_Estimation_of_Species_Trees_Under_Gene_Duplication_and_Loss","321619310_Phylogenetic_Supertrees_Combining_information_to_reveal_the_Tree_of_Life","315835276_Topological_Metrizations_of_Trees_and_New_Quartet_Methods_of_Tree_Inference","301877701_Species_Tree_Inference_from_Gene_Splits_by_Unrooted_STAR_Methods","46403062_BUCKy_Gene_Tree_Species_Tree_Reconciliation_with_Bayesian_Concordance_Analysis","16690287_Line-of-descent_and_genealogical_processes_and_their_applications_in_population_genetics_models","10667329_Bayesian_genespecies_tree_reconciliation_and_orthology_analysis_using_MCMC"]}
