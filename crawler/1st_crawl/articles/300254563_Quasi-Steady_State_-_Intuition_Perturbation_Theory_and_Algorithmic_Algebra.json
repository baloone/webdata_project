{"id":"300254563_Quasi-Steady_State_-_Intuition_Perturbation_Theory_and_Algorithmic_Algebra","abstract":"This survey of mathematical approaches to quasi-steady state (QSS) phenomena provides an analytical foundation for an algorithmic-algebraic treatment of the associated (parameter-dependent) ordinary differential systems, in particular for reaction networks. Topics include an ad hoc reduction procedure, singular perturbations, and methods to identify suitable parameter regions.","authors":["Alexandra Goeke","Sebastian Walcher","Eva Zerz"],"meta":["September 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-24021-3_10","Conference: International Workshop on Computer Algebra in Scientific Computing"],"references":["273705751_Detection_of_Hopf_Bifurcations_in_Chemical_Reaction_Networks_Using_Convex_Coordinates","263163749_Side_Conditions_for_Ordinary_Differential_Equations","256088444_Efficient_Methods_to_Compute_Hopf_Bifurcations_in_Chemical_Reaction_Networks_Using_Reaction_Coordinates","234812714_SINGULAR_a_computer_algebra_system_for_polynomial_computations","225678858_Quasi-steady-state_approximation_for_chemical_reaction_networks","221644778_Algebraic_Analysis_of_Bifurcation_and_Limit_Cycles_for_Biological_Systems","221588669_Chemical_Reaction_Systems_Computer_Algebra_and_Systems_Biology_Invited_Talk","41103667_Siphons_in_Chemical_Reaction_Networks","29646873_Model_Reduction_of_Chemical_Reaction_Systems_using_Elimination","24261217_A_multi-time-scale_analysis_of_chemical_reaction_networks_I_Deterministic_systems","14385086_Extending_the_quasi-steady_state_approximation_by_changing_variables","1960416_Reduction_of_Algebraic_Parametric_Systems_by_Rectification_of_Their_Affine_Expanded_Lie_Symmetries","321499956_Using_Algebraic_Geometry","306157758_Systems_of_differential_equations_containing_a_small_parameter_multiplying_the_derivative","273479618_Determining_small_parameters_for_quasi-steady_state","268891008_Methods_and_applications_of_singular_perturbations_Boundary_layers_and_multiple_timescale_dynamics","268543230_Tikhonov's_theorem_and_quasi-steady_state","266678577_A_constructive_approach_to_quasi-steady_state_reductions","266545201_Computing_in_algebraic_geometry_A_quick_start_using_SINGULAR","265367804_Basic_algebraic_geometry_Osnovy_algebraicheskoj_geometrii_Vol_1_Algebraic_manifolds_in_projective_space_Tom_1_Algebraicheskie_mnogoobraziya_v_proektivnom_prostranstve_Vol_2_Schemes_Complex_manifolds_T","265366038_Using_Algebraic_Geometry","257488338_Scaling_Invariants_and_Symmetry_Reduction_of_Dynamical_Systems","247824022_The_CSP_method_for_simplifying_chemical_kinetics","245581099_Basic_Algebraic_Geometry_1","243764881_Geometric_Singular_Perturbation_Theory_Ordianary_Differential_Equations","237847581_Theory_of_the_transient_phase_in_kinetics_with_special_reference_to_enzyme_systems","229061736_Die_Kinetik_der_Invertinwirkun","229061583_The_Quasi-Steady-State_Assumption_A_Case_Study_in_Perturbation","225144889_Towards_an_Automated_Reduction_Method_for_Polynomial_ODE_Models_of_Biochemical_Reaction_Systems","222602086_Kinetic_scheme_reduction_via_geometric_singular_perturbation_techniques","222580268_A_Family_of_Sparse_Polynomial_Systems_Arising_in_Chemical_Reaction_Systems","222010576_Quasi-steady-state_approximation_in_the_mathematical_modeling_of_biochemical_reaction_networks","220223218_Quasi-Steady_State_and_Nearly_Invariant_Sets","23578039_On_the_Mathematical_Status_of_the_Pseudo-Steady_State_Hypothesis_of_Biochemical_Kinetics","22628096_Analysis_of_the_quasi-steady-state_approximation_for_an_enzymatic_one-substrate_reaction","7038506_A_Note_on_the_Kinetics_of_Enzyme_Action","2521009_The_CSP_Method_for_Simplifying_Chemical_Kinetics"]}
