{"id":"345892901_Collision_Free_Hashing","abstract":"Out of distinct problems in the domain of computer sciences, hashing has its own importance. Hashing means mapping of data into a hash table with the help of hash function. It is widely adopted in the fields of database management and cryptography. There are numerous hash functions designed in order to map the data into a hash table. While mapping the data into a hash table, there is a chance that two data elements have the same key in this case collisions occur. In this paper we have proposed a new algorithm which eliminates collisions if we don't have any duplicate data.","authors":["Gopi Manoj Vuyyuru","Atcha Naga Mounika","Teja Veerendra Marupudi"],"meta":["July 2020"],"references":["224398575_Choosing_Best_Hashing_Strategies_and_Hash_Functions"]}
