{"id":"317673689_Rate_of_convergence_of_the_Nesterov_accelerated_gradient_method_in_the_subcritical_case_alpha_leq_3","abstract":"In a Hilbert space setting ℋ , given Φ : ℋ → ℝ a convex continuously differentiable function, and α a positive parameter, we consider the inertial dynamic system with Asymptotic Vanishing Damping (AVD) α ẍ ( t ) + α/ tẋ ( t ) + ∇ Φ ( x ( t )) = 0.\nDepending on the value of α with respect to 3, we give a complete picture of the convergence properties as t → + ∞ of the trajectories generated by (AVD) α , as well as iterations of the corresponding algorithms. Indeed, as shown by Su-Boyd-Candès, the case α = 3 corresponds to a continuous version of the accelerated gradient method of Nesterov, with the rate of convergence Φ ( x ( t )) − min Φ = O ( t ⁻² ) for α ≥ 3. Our main result concerns the subcritical case α ≤ 3, where we show that Φ ( x ( t )) − min Φ = O ( t −⅔ α ). This overall picture shows a continuous variation of the rate of convergence of the values Φ ( x ( t )) − min ℋ Φ = O ( t − p ( α ) ) with respect to α > 0: the coefficient p ( α ) increases linearly up to 2 when α goes from 0 to 3, then displays a plateau. Then we examine the convergence of trajectories to optimal solutions. As a new result, in the one-dimensional framework, for the critical value α = 3, we prove the convergence of the trajectories. In the second part of this paper, we study the convergence properties of the associated forward-backward inertial algorithms. They aim to solve structured convex minimization problems of the form min { Θ := Φ + Ψ }, with Φ smooth and Ψ nonsmooth. The continuous dynamics serves as a guideline for this study. We obtain a similar rate of convergence for the sequence of iterates ( x k ): for α ≤ 3 we have Θ ( x k ) − min Θ = O ( k − p ) for all p < 2 α /3, and for α > 3 Θ ( x k ) − min Θ = o ( k ⁻² ). Finally, we show that the results are robust with respect to external perturbations.","authors":["Hedy Attouch","Zaki Chbani","Hassan Riahi"],"meta":["June 2017ESAIM Control Optimisation and Calculus of Variations 25","DOI:10.1051/cocv/2017083","Project: Dynamics with asymptotic vanishing damping"],"references":["311221666_A_differential_equation_for_modeling_Nesterov's_accelerated_gradient_method_Theory_and_insights","309712271_Optimization_and_Asymptotic_Stability","293652168_FAST_CONVERGENCE_OF_INERTIAL_DYNAMICS_AND_ALGORITHMS_WITH_ASYMPTOTIC_VANISHING_DAMPING","283334397_The_rate_of_convergence_of_Nesterov's_accelerated_forward-backward_method_is_actually_ok-2","282000582_Asymptotic_for_a_second_order_evolution_equation_with_convex_potential_and_vanishing_damping_term","318382572_Asymptotic_stabilization_of_inertial_gradient_dynamics_with_time-dependent_viscosity","315573860_Convex_Analysis_and_Monotone_Operator_Theory_in_Hilbert_Spaces","315385151_Convex_Optimization_in_Normed_Spaces","301873455_Fast_convex_optimization_via_inertial_dynamics_with_Hessian_driven_damping","281185984_Stability_of_Over-Relaxations_for_the_Forward-Backward_Algorithm_Application_to_FISTA","270649199_Asymptotics_for_a_second-order_differential_equation_with_nonautonomous_damping_and_an_integrable_source_term","268988591_On_damped_second-order_gradient_systems","276459455_On_the_Convergence_of_the_Iterates_of_the_Fast_Iterative_ShrinkageThresholding_Algorithm","269853837_Proximal_Algorithms","268312680_The_dynamics_of_elastic_shocks_via_epigraphical_regularization_of_a_differential_inclusion_Barrier_and_penalty_approximations"]}
