{"id":"323178327_Associations_of_Number_Line_Estimation_With_Mathematical_Competence_A_Meta-analysis","abstract":"The number line estimation task is widely used to investigate mathematical learning and development. The present meta-analysis statistically synthesized the extensive evidence on the correlation between number line estimation and broader mathematical competence. Averaged over 263 effect sizes with 10576 participants with sample mean ages from 4 to 14 years, this correlation was r = .443. The correlation increased with age, mainly because it was higher for fractions than for whole numbers. The correlation remained stable across a wide range of task variants and mathematical competence measures (i.e., counting, arithmetic, school achievement). These findings demonstrate that the task is a robust tool for diagnosing and predicting broader mathematical competence and should be further investigated in developmental and experimental training studies.","authors":["Michael Schneider","Simon Merz","Johannes Stricker","Bert De Smedt"],"meta":["September 2018Child Development 89(5):1467-1484","DOI:10.1111/cdev.13068","Projects: Cognitive
