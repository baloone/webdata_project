{"id":"269299860_Wind_tunnel_testing_of_a_VTOL_MAV_propeller_in_tilted_operating_mode","abstract":"This paper presents experimental results of the full 3-axis force vector and 3-axis moment vector acting on a propeller, commonly used for a Vertical Take Off and Landing Micro Aerial Vehicle (VTOL MAV). Measurements were carried out in a wind tunnel using a high resolution 6-axis force/moment sensor embedded in a customized test rig at several wind speeds, propeller rotational speeds and angles of the propeller shaft with respect to the air stream. Results show strong moments acting on the propeller in forward flight and unstable conditions in descending flight. Power calculations reveal a decrease in power consumption during slow forward flight and how motor efficiency can be maximized.","authors":["Bart Theys","G. Dimitriadis","Thomas Andrianne","P.
