{"id":"288836337_An_Objective_No-Reference_Measure_of_Illumination_Assessment","abstract":"Illumination problems have been an important concern in many image processing applications. An important issue in the field of illumination enhancement is absence of a quantitative measure for assessment of illumination of an image. In this research work a quantitative measure indicating the illumination state, i.e. contrast level and brightness of an image is also proposed. The measure utilises the estimated Gaussian distribution of the input image and the Kullback-Leibler Divergence between the estimated Gaussian distribution and the desired Gaussian distribution to calculate the quantitative measure. The experimental results show the effectiveness and the reliability of proposed illumination assessment measure.","authors":["Gholamreza Anbarjafari"],"meta":["December 2015Measurement Science Review 15(6)","DOI:10.1515/msr-2015-0043"],"references":["261424436_Fuzzy_image_enhancement_for_low_contrast_and_non-uniform_illumination_images","233969870_Face_Recognition_Using_Color_Local_Binary_Pattern_from_Mutually_Independent_Color_Channels","224209829_Brightness_Preserving_Dynamic_Fuzzy_Histogram_Equalization","312771295_Image_quality_assessment_From_error_visibility_to_structural_similarity","304179954_Kullback-Leibler_Divergence","282375648_No-Reference_Image_Quality_Assessment_in_Spatial_Domain","261504058_No-reference_quality_metric_based_on_fuzzy_neural_network_for_subjective_image_watermarking_evaluation","261334946_Quality_metrics_for_practical_face_recognition","247131283_Image_Quality_Assessment_From_Error_Visibility_to_Structural_Similarity","224124539_Adaptive_Region-Based_Image_Enhancement_Method_for_Robust_Face_Recognition_Under_Variable_Illumination_Conditions"]}
