{"id":"40422724_AES_Implementation_and_Performance_Evaluation_on_8-bit_Microcontrollers","abstract":"The sensor network is a network technique for the implementation of Ubiquitous computing environment. It is wireless network environment that consists of the many sensors of lightweight and low-power. Though sensor network provides various capabilities, it is unable to ensure the secure authentication between nodes. Eventually it causes the losing reliability of the entire network and many secure problems. Therefore, encryption algorithm for the implementation of reliable sensor network environments is required to the applicable sensor network. In this paper, we proposed the solution of reliable sensor network to analyze the communication efficiency through measuring performance of AES encryption algorithm by plaintext size, and cost of operation per hop according to the network scale.","authors":["Lee Hyubgun","Lee Kyounghwa","Shin Yongtae"],"meta":["November 2009International Journal of Computer Science and Information Security, 6(1)","SourceDBLP"],"references":["2237728_AES_proposal_rijndael","236183261_Part_154_wireless_medium_access_control_MAC_and_physical_layer_PHY_specifications_for_low-rate_wireless_personal_area_networks_LR-WPANs_ANSIIEEE_Std_802154","3457449_AES_implementation_on_a_grain_of_sand","3454697_Securing_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_A_survey"]}
