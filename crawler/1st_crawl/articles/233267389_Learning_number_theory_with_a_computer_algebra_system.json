{"id":"233267389_Learning_number_theory_with_a_computer_algebra_system","abstract":"The paper discusses how a computer algebra system MAPLE can be used to enhance the learning of concepts, theorems and algorithms in an elementary classical number theory course. There are 20 built‚Äêin routines selected from the MAPLE number theory package which students can easily use to consolidate their learning. The commands include ifactor, isolve, isprime, Fermat, Mersenne, phi, tau, sigma and so on. A few examples are described to illustrate the uses of the package in the Chinese Remainder Theorem, primality testing, factorization, RSA cipher system and other topics.","authors":["Y. L.
