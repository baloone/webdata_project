{"id":"287025555_Design_of_observer-based_discrete_repetitive-control_system_based_on_2D_model","abstract":"A discrete observer-based repetitive control (RC) design method for a linear system with uncertainties was presented based on two-dimensional (2D) system theory. Firstly, a 2D discrete model was established to describe both the control behavior within a repetition period and the learning process taking place between periods. Next, by converting the designing problem of repetitive controller into one of the feedback gains of reconstructed variables, the stable condition was obtained through linear matrix inequality (LMI) and also the gain coefficient of repetitive system. Numerical simulation shows an exceptional feasibility of this proposal with remarkable robustness and tracking speed.
