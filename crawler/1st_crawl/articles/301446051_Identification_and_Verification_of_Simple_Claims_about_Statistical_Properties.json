{"id":"301446051_Identification_and_Verification_of_Simple_Claims_about_Statistical_Properties","abstract":"In this paper we study the identification and verification of simple claims about statistical properties, e.g. claims about the population or the inflation rate of a coun- try. We show that this problem is similar to extracting numerical information from text and following recent work, instead of annotating data for each property of inter- est in order to learn supervised models, we develop a distantly supervised base- line approach using a knowledge base and raw text. In experiments on 16 statistical properties about countries from Freebase we show that our approach identifies sim- ple statistical claims about properties with 60% precision, while it is able to verify these claims without requiring any explicit supervision for either tasks. Furthermore, we evaluate our approach as a statistical property extractor and we show it achieves 0.11 mean absolute percentage error.","authors":["Andreas Vlachos","Sebastian Riedel"],"meta":["January 2015","DOI:10.18653/v1/D15-1312","Conference: Proceedings of the 2015 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing"],"references":["301405022_Fact_Checking_Task_definition_and_dataset_construction","272091377_The_Stanford_CoreNLP_Natural_Language_Processing_Toolkit","270905908_Computational_Fact_Checking_from_Knowledge_Networks","232877290_The_promise_of_computational_journalism","221519989_Boilerplate_Detection_Using_Shallow_Text_Features","273634085_Diamonds_in_the_Rough_Event_Extraction_from_Imperfect_Microblog_Data","272194238_Knowledge-Based_Trust_Estimating_the_Trustworthiness_of_Web_Sources","270878560_Language-Aware_Truth_Assessment_of_Fact_Candidates","222665190_Another_look_at_measures_of_forecast_accuracy","221520071_Information_arbitrage_across_multi-lingual_Wikipedia"]}
