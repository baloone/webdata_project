{"id":"320174898_Benchmarking_Commercial_Conformer_Ensemble_Generators","abstract":"Model: \n2017, 57, 529-539). For commercial algorithms the median minimum RMSDs measured between protein-bound ligand conformations and ensembles of a maximum of 250 conformers are between 0.46 and 0.61 Ã…. Commercial conformer ensemble generators are characterized by their high robustness, with at least 99% of all input molecules successfully processed and few or even no substantial geometrical errors detectable in their output conformations. The RDKit DG algorithm (with minimization enabled) appears to be a good free alternative since its performance is comparable to that of the mid-ranked commercial algorithms. Based on a statistical analysis, we elaborate on which algorithms to use and how to parameterize them for best performance in different application scenarios.","authors":["Nils-Ole Friedrich","Christina de Bruyn Kops","Florian Flachsenberg","Kai Sommer"],"meta":["October 2017Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling 57(11)","DOI:10.1021/acs.jcim.7b00505"],"references":["282452918_BCLCONF_small_molecule_conformational_sampling_using_a_knowledge_based_rotamer_library","270665459_Bringing_the_MMFF_force_field_to_the_RDKit_Implementation_and_validation","50408569_Confab_-_Systematic_generation_of_diverse_low-energy_conformers","44575464_Frog2_Efficient_3D_conformation_ensemble_generator_for_small_compounds","42253650_Conformer_Generation_with_OMEGA_Algorithm_and_Validation_Using_High_Quality_Structures_from_the_Protein_Databank_and_Cambridge_Structural_Database","21131424_Improved_Methods_for_Building_Protein_Models_in_Electron_Density_Maps_and_Location_of_Errors_in_These_Models","5449385_MS-DOCK_Accurate_multiple_conformation_generator_and_rigid_docking_protocol_for_multi-step_virtual_ligand_screening","353606110_MMFF_VI_MMFF94s_option_for_energy_minimization_studies","320252148_Estimating_Electron_Density_Support_for_Individual_Atoms_and_Molecular_Fragments_in_X-ray_Structures","318279985_Conformation_Generation_The_State_of_the_Art","313797395_High-Quality_Dataset_of_Protein-Bound_Ligand_Conformations_and_Its_Application_to_Benchmarking_Conformer_Ensemble_Generators","284164083_Better_Informed_Distance_Geometry_Using_What_We_Know_To_Improve_Conformation_Generation","284160533_OPLS3_A_Force_Field_Providing_Broad_Coverage_of_Drug-like_Small_Molecules_and_Proteins","270903100_The_Protein_Data_Bank","255916038_DREIDING_A_generic_force_field_for_molecular_simulations","255715200_CONFECT_Conformations_from_an_Expert_Collection_of_Torsion_Patterns","228062835_Essential_considerations_for_using_protein-ligand_structures_in_drug_discovery","223964146_Freely_Available_Conformer_Generation_Methods_How_Good_Are_They","221996084_Merck_molecular_force_field_I--V_MMFF94_Basics_and_Parameters","51783026_NAOMI_On_the_Almost_Trivial_Task_of_Reading_Molecules_from_Different_File_formats","43353538_LowModeMD-Implicit_Low-Mode_Velocity_Filtering_Applied_to_Conformational_Search_of_Macrocycles_and_Protein_Loops","43071863_ConfGen_A_Conformational_Search_Method_for_Efficient_Generation_of_Bioactive_Conformers","23230020_Conformational_Sampling_of_Druglike_Molecules_with_MOE_and_Catalyst_Implications_for_Pharmacophore_Modeling_and_Virtual_Screening","13202560_Remarks_About_Protein_Structure_Precision","8411125_Refinement_of_Macromolecular_Structures_by_the_Maximum-Likelihood_Method","8064841_LigandScout_3-D_Pharmacophores_Derived_from_Protein-Bound_Ligands_and_Their_Use_as_Virtual_Screening_Filters","5952690_Generating_Conformer_Ensembles_Using_a_Multiobjective_Genetic_Algorithm"]}
