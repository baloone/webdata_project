{"id":"341400319_A_Multiple-Search_Multi-Start_Framework_for_Metaheuristics_for_Clustering_Problems","abstract":"Metaheuristic algorithms have been widely used as an effective and efficient way for solving various complex optimization problems; there is, however, plenty of room for improvement. In this research area, the two most important issues that greatly influence the final results of single-solution-based metaheuristic algorithms are in that: (1) some of them are extremely sensitive to the initial solutions, and (2) some of them are easy to fall into a local optimum at early iterations. For these reasons, an effective framework, called multiple-search multi-start for single-solution-based metaheuristic algorithm (MSMS-S), is presented in this paper to mitigate the impact of these issues. MSMS-S ensures that a search procedure will be given different search directions based on the so-called re-start mechanism. To evaluate the performance of the proposed framework, we compare it with several well-known single-solution-based metaheuristic algorithms for clustering and codebook generation problems. Simulation results show that the proposed framework is capable of improving the performance of single-solution-based metaheuristic algorithms.","authors":["Kai-Cheng Hu","Chun-Wei Tsai","Ming-Chao Chiang"],"meta":["May 2020IEEE Access PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2994813"],"references":["307182616_Application_of_efficient_metaheuristics_to_solve_a_new_bi-objective_optimization_model_for_hub_facility_location_problem_considering_value_at_risk_criterion","301709111_Optimal_pavement_maintenance_programs_based_on_a_hybrid_Greedy_Randomized_Adaptive_Search_Procedure_Algorithm","333375601_Nature_inspired_meta-heuristic_algorithms_for_solving_the_load-balancing_problem_in_cloud_environments","313706874_Adaptation_in_natural_and_artificial_systems","309715704_Least_squares_quantization_in_PCM","305397619_Data_Clustering_A_Review","266562508_An_Iterated_Local_Search_heuristic_for_the_Split_Delivery_Vehicle_Routing_Problem","264585236_Data_Mining_for_Internet_of_Things_A_Survey","262291548_Multi-start_iterated_local_search_for_the_periodic_vehicle_routing_problem_with_time_windows_and_time_spread_constraints_on_services","260523624_Metaheuristic_Scheduling_for_Cloud_A_Survey"]}
