{"id":"284084779_On_the_minimum_and_maximum_selective_graph_coloring_problems_in_some_graph_classes","abstract":"Given a graph together with a partition of its vertex set, the minimum selective coloring problem consists of selecting one vertex per partition set such that the chromatic number of the subgraph induced by the selected vertices is minimum. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we investigate the complexity status of the minimum selective coloring problem in some specific graph classes motivated by some models described in Demange et al. (2015). Second, we introduce a new problem that corresponds to the worst situation in the minimum selective coloring; the maximum selective coloring problem aims to select one vertex per partition set such that the chromatic number of the subgraph induced by the selected vertices is maximum. We motivate this problem by different models and give some first results concerning its complexity.","authors":["Marc Demange","Tinaz Ekim","Bernard Ries"],"meta":["November 2015Discrete Applied Mathematics 204","DOI:10.1016/j.dam.2015.10.005"],"references":["220617696_The_Complexity_of_Multiterminal_Cuts","3735245_A_new_paradigm_for_dichotomy-based_constrained_encoding","277291605_The_partition_coloring_problem_and_its_application_to_wavelength_routing_and_assignment","265461639_Indifference_graphs","265444422_The_Complexity_of_Coloring_Circular_Arcs_and_Chords","265435621_Algorithm_Graph_Theory_and_Perfect_Graphs","264550133_On_Some_Applications_Of_The_Selective_Graph_Coloring_Problem","256935855_Claw-free_graphs_VII_Quasi-line_graphs","250927254_Perfectness_of_clustered_graphs","240145507_On_coloring_j-unit_sphere_graphs","239921596_A_Branch-and-Cut_Algorithm_for_Partition_Coloring","236271662_On_the_complexity_of_the_selective_graph_coloring_problem_in_some_special_classes_of_graphs","223901269_The_Complexity_of_Path_Coloring_and_Call_Scheduling","222672300_Routing_and_wavelength_assignment_by_partition_coloring","222469840_Unit_Disk_Graphs","221394882_A_Branch-and-Price_Approach_for_the_Partition_Coloring_Problem","220695890_Computers_and_Intracdtability_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness","220690835_Network_Flows_Theory_Algorithms_and_Applications","220223818_On_Coloring_Unit_Disk_Graphs","220060064_A_branch-and-price_approach_for_the_partition_coloring_problem","2238137_Unit_Disk_Graph_Recognition_is_NP-Hard"]}
