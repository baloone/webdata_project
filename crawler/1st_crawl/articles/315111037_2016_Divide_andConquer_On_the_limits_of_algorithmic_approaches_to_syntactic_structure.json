{"id":"315111037_2016_Divide_andConquer_On_the_limits_of_algorithmic_approaches_to_syntactic_structure","abstract":"In computer science, divide and conquer (D&C) is a top-down algorithm design paradigm based on multibranched recursion. D&C works by recursively breaking down a problem into sub-problems of the same (or a related) type, until these become simple enough to be solved directly. The solutions are then combined to give a solution to the original problem. The present work identifies D&C algorithms assumed within contemporary syntactic theory, and discusses the limits of their applicability in the realms of the syntax-semantics and syntax-morpho-phonology interfaces, including empirical evidence from coordinated structures and dependencies within auxiliary chains. We will propose that D&C algorithms fall short given a ‘mixed’ approach to the structure of linguistic phrase markers.","authors":["Diego Gabriel Krivochen"],"meta":["March 2017","Project: Locality and Mixed Computation"],"references":["285334144_On_Auxiliary_Chains_Auxiliaries_at_the_Syntax-Semantics_Interface","283980368_Locative_and_Directional_Prepositions_in_Conceptual_Spaces_The_Role_of_Polar_Convexity","279458578_Linguistics_and_Some_Aspects_of_Its_Underlying_Dynamics","269113430_2015_On_Phrase_Structure_building_and_Labeling_algorithms_towards_a_non-uniform_theory_of_syntactic_structures","319394391_Constraints_on_Variables_in_syntax","316153428_Targets_Theory_and_Methods_of_Slavic_Generative_Syntax_Minimalism_Negation_and_Clitics_Ziele_Theorie_und_Methoden_der_slavischen_generativen_Syntax_Minimalismus_Negation_und_Klitika","304973922_Computational_Perspectives_on_Minimalism","291025299_Is_Deep_Structure_Necessary","290851674_A_New_Theory_of_English_Auxiliaries","287949133_Target_a_Deducing_strict_cyclicity_from_derivational_economy"]}
