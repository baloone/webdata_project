{"id":"324453006_Linear-time_filtering_algorithms_for_the_disjunctive_constraint_and_a_quadratic_filtering_algorithm_for_the_cumulative_not-first_not-last","abstract":"We present new filtering algorithms for Disjunctive and Cumulative constraints, each of which improves the complexity of the state-of-the-art algorithms by a factor of log n. We show how to perform Time-Tabling and Detectable Precedences in linear time on the Disjunctive constraint. Furthermore, we present a linear-time Overload Checking for the Disjunctive and Cumulative constraints. Finally, we show how the rule of Not-first/Not-last can be enforced in quadratic time for the Cumulative constraint. These algorithms rely on the union find data structure, from which we take advantage to introduce a new data structure that we call it time line. This data structure provides constant time operations that were previously implemented in logarithmic time by the Î˜-tree data structure. Experiments show that these new algorithms are competitive even for a small number of tasks and outperform existing algorithms as the number of tasks increases. We also show that the time line can be used to solve specific scheduling problems.","authors":["Hamed Fahimi","Yanick Ouellet","Claude-Guy Quimper"],"meta":["July 2018Constraints 23(1-2)","DOI:10.1007/s10601-018-9282-9"],"references":["278658733_Continuous_Casting_Scheduling_with_Constraint_Programming","274403074_Exploration_of_models_for_a_cargo_assembly_planning_problem","257800241_A_cumulative_not-firstnot-last_filtering_algorithm_in_On_2logn","290878078_Time-Table_Extended-Edge-Finding_for_the_Cumulative_Constraint","287732109_Linear-time_filtering_algorithms_for_the_disjunctive_constraint","283633380_Simple_and_Scalable_Time-Table_Filtering_for_the_Cumulative_Constraint","280851930_A_Scalable_Sweep_Algorithm_for_the_cumulative_Constraint","266861783_Filtering_algorithms_for_the_unary_resource_constraint","265530412_Constraint-Based_Scheduling_Applying_Constraint_Programming_to_Scheduling_Problems","257596724_Solving_RCPSPmax_by_lazy_clause_generation","247442902_Introduction_To_Algorithms","245776252_Constraint-based_scheduling_A_theoretical_comparison_of_resource_constraint_propagation_rules","230672474_Explaining_Time-Table-Edge-Finding_Propagation_for_the_CumulativeResource_Constraint","230668955_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","229758534_Some_Simple_Scheduling_Algorithms"]}
