{"id":"222168678_Using_planning_techniques_in_intelligent_tutoring_systems","abstract":"This paper proposes an architecture for building better Computer-Assisted Instruction (CAI) programs by applying and extending Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques which were developed for planning and controlling the actions of robots. A detailed example shows how programs built according to this architecture are able to plan global teaching strategies using local information. Since the student's behavior can never be accurately predicted, the pre-planned teaching strategies may be foiled by sudden surprises and obstacles. In such cases, the planning component of the program is dynamically reinvoked to revise the unsuccessful strategy, often by recognizing student misconceptions and planning a means to correct them. This plan-based teaching strategy scheme makes use of global course knowledge in a flexible way that avoids the rigidity of earlier CAI systems. It also allows larger courses to be built than has been possible in most AI-based “intelligent tutoring systems” (ITSs), which seldom address the problem of global teaching strategies.","authors":["Darwyn R.
