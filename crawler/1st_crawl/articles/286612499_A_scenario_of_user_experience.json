{"id":"286612499_A_scenario_of_user_experience","abstract":"A steady stream of research in user experience (UX) has been produced over the last ten years. However, published work has not been reviewed and analysed to synthesise the knowledge developed. To address this issue, this article presents a review of theories, models and frameworks of UX from different disciplines. Based on the review a scenario in which user experience develops is proposed. Four elements have been identified that have a strong impact on user experience: the user, the interaction, the artefact, and the context. Each element is reviewed in detail, outlining its major characteristics.","authors":["Juan Carlos Ortiz Nicol√°s","Marco Aurisicchio"],"meta":["August 2011","Conference: ICED 11 - 18th International Conference on Engineering Design - Impacting Society Through Engineering Design","Project: User Experience"],"references":["320557335_Product_Relevant_Emotions_in_the_Spanish_Language","297429355_Special_Issue_Editorial_Aesthetics_of_Interaction","287164845_Understanding_playfulness_An_overview_of_the_revised_playful_experience_PLEX_framework","261873583_Designing_Emotions","321704681_The_embodied_mind_Cognitive_science_and_human_experience","287921673_The_Product_Ecology_Understanding_Social_Product_Use_and_Supporting_Design_Culture","281573123_The_problem_of_design_problems","279719397_Introducing_Product_Experience_Product_Experience","279427427_Aesthetics_in_interactive_products","278704657_User_Experience_Over_Time"]}
