{"id":"301872944_PetIGA-MF_A_multi-field_high-performance_toolbox_for_structure-preserving_B-splines_spaces","abstract":"We describe the development of a high-performance solution framework for isogeometric discrete differential forms based on B-splines: PetIGA-MF. Built on top of PetIGA, PetIGA-MF is a general multi-field discretization tool. To test the capabilities of our implementation, we solve different viscous flow problems such as Darcy, Stokes, Brinkman, and Navier-Stokes equations. Several convergence benchmarks based on manufactured solutions are presented assuring optimal convergence rates of the approximations, showing the accuracy and robustness of our solver.","authors":["Adel Sarmiento","Adriano Cortes","Daniel Garcia","Lisandro Daniel Dalcin"],"meta":["February 2016Journal of Computational Science","DOI:10.1016/j.jocs.2016.09.010","Project: Divergence conforming discretizations for engineering applications"],"references":["303445887_Energy_Exchange_Analysis_in_Droplet_Dynamics_via_the_Navier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard_Model","277919359_Coupling_Navier-stokes_and_Cahn-hilliard_Equations_in_a_Two-dimensional_Annular_flow_Configuration","262338354_An_energy-stable_convex_splitting_for_the_phase-field_crystal_equation","261366393_Computational_cost_estimates_for_parallel_shared_memory_isogeometric_multi-frontal_solvers","256744080_Isogeometric_Divergence-conforming_B-splines_for_the_Steady_Navier-Stokes_Equations","228648648_Isogeometric_collocation_methods","228442920_Isogeometric_Divergence-conforming_B-splines_for_the_Darcy-Stokes-Brinkman_Equations","220179507_Isogeometric_Discrete_Differential_Forms_in_Three_Dimensions","45858457_Finite_element_exterior_calculus_From_Hodge_theory_to_numerical_stability","280692648_Isogeometric_divergence-conforming_B-splines_for_the_steady_Navier-Stokes_equations","272524203_Performance_evaluation_of_block-diagonal_preconditioners_for_the_divergence-conforming_B-Spline_discretization_of_the_Stokes_system","267144607_A_First_Course_in_Continuum_Mechanics","261288989_Three-dimensional_iso-geometric_solutions_to_general_boundary_value_problems_of_Toupin's_gradient_elasticity_theory_at_finite_strains","246192858_Finite_Element_Methods_For_Maxwell's_Equations","236871348_PetIGA_A_Framework_for_High-Performance_Isogeometric_Analysis","229895101_An_accurate_numerical_solution_algorithm_for_3D_velocity-vorticity_Navier-Stokes_equations_by_the_DQ_method","229877797_Numerical_solution_of_three-dimensional_velocity-vorticity_Navier-Stokes_equations_by_finite_difference_method","229876419_IsoGeometric_Analysis_Stable_elements_for_the_2D_Stokes_equation","229463180_A_3D_incompressible_Navier-Stokes_velocity-vorticity_weak_form_finite_element_algorithm","223546856_Isogeometric_variational_multiscale_modeling_of_wall-bounded_turbulent_flows_with_weakly_enforced_boundary_conditions_on_unstretched_meshes","223113264_De_Rham_Diagram_for_hp_Finite_Element_Spaces","222901100_Benchmark_spectral_results_on_the_lid-driven_cavity_flow","222440553_High-Re_solutions_for_incompressible_flow_using_the_Navier-Stokes_equations_and_a_multigrid_method1","222415202_Isogeometric_analysis_in_electromagnetics_B-splines_approximation","222414900_Weak_Dirichlet_boundary_conditions_for_wall-bounded_turbulent_flows_Comput_Methods_Appl_Mech_Eng_196_4853-4862","220694079_The_Nurbs_Book","51992201_Isogeometric_Analysis_Toward_integration_of_CAD_and_FEA"]}
