{"id":"329890275_Ontology","abstract":"Ontology has historically emerged from the meaning of this term against research methodology in order to the knowledge and technology developments. A term that has been known for a long time, but requires a meaning of abstraction in order to be developed to form a new understanding of a domain, and thereby make it easier to build an approach to the issues that are present with it. Of course, looking at the purpose of the ontology description, the approach taken is based on mathematics, which is described philosophically by basis of the ontology of being, to be and existence. In some cases, this trait gives birth the relationship between the decisive parameters in the mathematical model of domain like the social actor in social network.","authors":["Mahyuddin K. M.
