{"id":"262152619_Using_Alice_20_as_a_first_language","abstract":"This paper describes how Alice 2.0 is being used in an introductory programming course, the first in a three course sequence that meets the description of the object-oriented sequence described in the CC2001 report. The modifications to the syllabi to accommodate an Alice-Java-Java sequence are described.. Issues caused by using Alice for an introduction programming in the first course for both computing majors and liberal studies students are explored. Retention data and percentage of women enrolled when using Alice for the first semester is compared to data for C++.","authors":["Paul Mullins","Deborah Whitfield","Michael Conlon"],"meta":["January 2009Journal of Computing Sciences in Colleges 24(3):136-143"],"references":["221538824_Evaluating_the_effectiveness_of_a_new_instructional_approach","221538147_Games_stories_or_something_more_traditional_the_types_of_assignments_college_students_prefer","221514864_Storytelling_Alice_motivates_middle_school_girls_to_learn_computer_programming","215900275_Back_to_basics_in_CS1_and_CS2","234818674_Concept_visualization_in_CS0_using_ALICE","221537775_Through_the_looking_glass_teaching_CS0_with_Alice","220612681_Controversy_on_how_to_teach_CS_1_a_discussion_on_the_SIGCSE-members_mailing_list"]}
