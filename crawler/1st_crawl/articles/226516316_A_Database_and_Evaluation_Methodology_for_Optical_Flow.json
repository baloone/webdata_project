{"id":"226516316_A_Database_and_Evaluation_Methodology_for_Optical_Flow","abstract":"The quantitative evaluation of optical flow algorithms by Barron et al. (1994) led to significant advances in performance. The challenges for optical flow algorithms today go beyond the datasets and\nevaluation methods proposed in that paper. Instead, they center on problems associated with complex natural scenes, including\nnonrigid motion, real sensor noise, and motion discontinuities. We propose a new set of benchmarks and evaluation methods\nfor the next generation of optical flow algorithms. To that end, we contribute four types of data to test different aspects\nof optical flow algorithms: (1)sequences with nonrigid motion where the ground-truth flow is determined by tracking hidden\nfluorescent texture, (2)realistic synthetic sequences, (3)high frame-rate video used to study interpolation error, and (4)modified\nstereo sequences of static scenes. In addition to the average angular error used by Barron etal., we compute the absolute\nflow endpoint error, measures for frame interpolation error, improved statistics, and results at motion discontinuities and\nin textureless regions. In October 2007, we published the performance of several well-known methods on a preliminary version\nof our data to establish the current state of the art. We also made the data freely available on the web at http://vision.middlebury.edu/flow/. Subsequently a number of researchers have uploaded their results to our website and published papers using the data. A significant\nimprovement in performance has already been achieved. In this paper we analyze the results obtained to date and draw a large\nnumber of conclusions from them.\n\nKeywordsOptical flow–Survey–Algorithms–Database–Benchmarks–Evaluation–Metrics","authors":["Simon Baker","Daniel Scharstein","J.P.
