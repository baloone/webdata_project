{"id":"335002887_BARP_Improving_Mister_P_Using_Bayesian_Additive_Regression_Trees","abstract":"Multilevel regression and post-stratification (MRP) is the current gold standard for extrapolating opinion data from nationally representative surveys to smaller geographic units. However, innovations in nonparametric regularization methods can further improve the researcherâ€™s ability to extrapolate opinion data to a geographic unit of interest. I test an ensemble of regularization algorithms and find that there is room for substantial improvement on the multilevel model via more flexible methods of regularization. I propose a modified version of MRP that replaces the multilevel model with a nonparametric approach called Bayesian additive regression trees (BART or, when combined with post-stratification, BARP). I compare both methods across a number of data contexts, demonstrating the benefits of applying more powerful regularization methods to extrapolate opinion data to target geographical units. I provide an R package that implements the BARP method.","authors":["JAMES BISBEE"],"meta":["August 2019American Political Science Association 113(4):1-6","DOI:10.1017/S0003055419000480"],"references":["299502238_bartMachine_Machine_Learning_with_Bayesian_Additive_Regression_Trees","295261165_Comparing_Strategies_for_Estimating_Constituency_Opinion_from_National_Survey_Samples","258228792_BART_Bayesian_additive_regression_trees","328945841_Public_Opinion_in_Subnational_Politics","328431165_The_democratic_deficit_on_salient_issues_Immigration_and_healthcare_in_the_states","322949951_Voting_patterns_in_2016_Exploration_using_multilevel_regression_and_poststratification_MRP_on_pre-election_polls","322358628_A_review_of_tree-based_Bayesian_methods","274133938_How_Does_Multilevel_Regression_and_Poststratification_Perform_with_Conventional_National_Surveys","264520297_Deep_Interactions_with_MRP_Election_Turnout_and_Voting_Patterns_Among_Small_Electoral_Subgroups","259418658_How_Should_We_Measure_District-Level_Public_Opinion_on_Individual_Issues","245774988_Constituency_Opinion_and_Congressional_Policy_Making_The_Reagan_Defense_Build_Up","237908533_Poststratification_Into_Many_Categories_Using_Hierarchical_Logistic_Regression","227735499_The_Democratic_Deficit_in_The_States","227659014_How_Should_We_Estimate_Public_Opinion_in_The_States"]}
