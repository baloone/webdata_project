{"id":"230190037_Short-cut_signal_detection_measures_for_sensory_analysis","abstract":"Traditional sensory difference tests demonstrate whether a difference exists or not between two flavors; to determine the degree of difference requires further scaling. The two processes can be combined for perceptually small differences using difference tests based on signal detection measures. Such measures provide a measure of degree of difference directly which being a probability value is susceptible to analysis by parametric statistics Traditional signal detection measures are complex and time consuming but the present paper outlines a short and simple means of calculating such measures.","authors":["Michael O'Mahony"],"meta":["August 2006Journal of Food Science 44(1):302 - 303","DOI:10.1111/j.1365-2621.1979.tb10071.x"],"references":["292431589_A_signal_detection_approach_to_taste_difference_testing_between_two_levels_of_alcohol_in_a_flowise_presented_sherry_stimulus","292218854_Signal_detection_difference_testing_of_colas_using_a_modified_R-index_approach","264558579_In_Principles_of_Sensory_Evaluation_of_Foods","232523268_The_Psychophysics_of_Sensory_Function","229650005_Recognition_assessed_by_rating_and_ranking","215606073_Signal_Detection_Theory_in_Psychophysics"]}
