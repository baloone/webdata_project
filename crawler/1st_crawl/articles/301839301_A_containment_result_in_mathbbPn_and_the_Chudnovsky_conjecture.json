{"id":"301839301_A_containment_result_in_mathbbPn_and_the_Chudnovsky_conjecture","abstract":"In the paper we prove the containment $I^{(nm)}\\subset M^{(n-1)m}I^m$, for a radical ideal $I$ of $s$ general points in $\\mathbb{P}^n$, where $s\\geq 2^n$. As a corollary we get that the Chudnovsky Conjecture holds for a very general set of at least $2^n$ points in $\\mathbb{P}^n$.","authors":["Marcin Dumnicki","Halszka Tutaj-Gasi≈Ñska"],"meta":["March 2016Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society 145(9)","DOI:10.1090/proc/13582"],"references":["228578444_Fine_behavior_of_symbolic_powers_of_ideals","50893529_Are_symbolic_powers_highly_evolved","45858610_The_resurgence_of_ideals_of_points_and_the_containment_problem","2104503_Comparison_of_symbolic_and_ordinary_powers_of_ideals","267019334_Counterexamples_to_the_I_3_I_2_containment","266512605_Singular_points_on_complex_hypersurfaces_and_multidimensional_Schwarz_lemma","253304145_Symbolic_powers_of_ideals_of_generic_points_in_P3","247379321_Regularity_of_the_powers_of_an_ideal","242975429_Sur_une_minoration_du_degr_d'hypersurfaces_s'annulant_en_certains_points","240150390_On_the_14-th_problem_of_Hilbert","233824353_Containments_of_symbolic_powers_of_ideals_of_generic_points_in_PP3","226930786_Graded_Betti_numbers_of_some_embedded_rationaln-folds","225407753_A_note_on_symbolic_and_ordinary_powers_of_homogeneous_ideals","225220604_Proprietes_arithmetiques_de_fonctions_de_plusieurs_variables_II","223150124_An_algorithm_to_bound_the_regularity_and_nonemptiness_of_linear_systems_in_Pn","222654946_A_sharp_bound_for_the_Castelnuovo-Mumford_regularity_of_subspace_arrangements","2113744_On_the_postulation_of_sd_fat_points_in_Pd"]}
