{"id":"352345768_An_Epistemic_Model-Based_Tutor_for_Imperative_Programming","abstract":"We developed a tutor for imperative programming in C++. It covers algorithm formulation, program design and coding â€“ all three stages involved in writing a program to solve a problem. The design of the tutor is epistemic, i.e., true to real-life programming practice. The student works through all the three stages of programming in interleaved fashion, and within the context of a single code canvas. The student has the sole agency to compose the program and write the code. The tutor uses goals and plans as prompts to scaffold the student through the programming process designed by an expert. It provides drill-down immediate feedback at the abstract, concrete and bottom-out levels at each step. So, by the end of the session, the student is guaranteed to write the complete and correct program for a given problem. We used model-based architecture to implement the tutor because of the ease with which it facilitates adding problems to the tutor. In a preliminary study, we found that practicing with the tutor helped students solve problems with fewer erroneous actions and less time.","authors":["Amruth Kumar"],"meta":["June 2021","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-78270-2_38","In book: Artificial Intelligence in Education (pp.213-218)"],"references":["329406943_An_integrated_practice_system_for_learning_programming_in_Python_design_and_evaluation","322343924_Intelligent_tutoring_systems_for_programming_education_a_systematic_review","293194628_Ask-Elle_an_Adaptable_Programming_Tutor_for_Haskell_Giving_Automated_Feedback","275652566_A_flowchart-based_intelligent_tutoring_system_for_improving_problem-solving_skills_of_novice_programmers_Flowchart-based_Intelligent_Tutoring_System","266081141_A_Process_for_Novice_Programming_Using_Goals_and_Plans","260790570_Design_Development_and_Evaluation_of_the_Java_Intelligent_Tutoring_System","234796737_Learning_to_Program_Learning_to_Construct_Mechanisms_and_Explanations","232911602_Teaching_the_tacit_knowledge_of_programming_to_noviceswith_natural_language_tutoring","228328489_SICAS_Interactive_system_for_algorithm_development_and_simulation","221413997_Model-Based_Reasoning_for_Domain_Modeling_in_a_Web-Based_Intelligent_Tutoring_System_to_Help_Students_Learn_to_Debug_C_Programs","220815237_Dynamic_Student_Modelling_in_an_Intelligent_Tutor_for_LISP_Programming","220808430_Iconic_programming_for_flowcharts_java_turing_etc","38319356_J-Latte_a_Constraint-Based_Tutor_for_Java","327946451_A_Systematic_Literature_Review_of_Automated_Feedback_Generation_for_Programming_Exercises","311474797_Pre-programming_analysis_tutors_help_students_learn_basic_programming_concepts","308848876_Towards_an_Integrative_Learning_Environment_for_Java_Programming","307089173_Evaluation_of_a_Frame-based_Programming_Editor","303319606_Using_Turing's_Craft_CodeLab_to_support_CS1_students_as_they_learn_to_program","300708288_Evaluation_of_Guided-Planning_and_Assisted-Coding_with_Task_Relevant_Dynamic_Hinting","269255269_CSTutor_An_Intelligent_Tutoring_System_that_Supports_Natural_Learning","261028741_Analysing_Student_Programs_in_the_PHP_Intelligent_Tutoring_System","242380937_Supporting_Programming_and_Learning-to-Program_with_an_Integrated_CAD_and_Scaffolding_Workbench","236449899_Intention-based_diagnosis_of_errors_in_novice_programs","222450661_Diagnostic_Reasoning_Based_on_Structure_and_Behavior","4337095_E-Learning_For_Novice_Programmers_A_Dynamic_Visualisation_and_Problem_Solving_Tool","2770183_Exploiting_Program_Schemata_in_a_Prolog_Tutoring_System"]}
