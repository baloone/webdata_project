{"id":"265373640_Betti_Numbers_of_Semialgebraic_and_Sub-Pfaffian_Sets","abstract":"Let X be a subset in [-1, 1] n0 ⊂ ℝ n0 defined by the formula X = {x 0 | Q 1x 1Q 2x 2 . . . Q vx v((x 0, x 1, . . ., x v) ∈ X v)}, where Q i ∈ {∃, ∀}, Q i ≠ Q i+1, x i ∈ [-1, 1] ni, and X v may be either an open or a closed set in [-1, 1] n0+...+nv, being the difference between a finite CW-complex and its subcomplex. An upper bound on each Betti number of X is expressed via a sum of Betti numbers of some sets defined by quantifier-free formulae involving X v. In important particular cases of semialgebraic and semi-Pfaffian sets defined by quantifier-free formulae with polynomials and Pfaffian functions respectively, upper bounds on Betti numbers of X v are well known. The results allow to extend the bounds to sets defined with quantifiers, in particular to sub-Pfaffian sets.","authors":["A. Gabrielov","Nicolai Vorobjov","T.
