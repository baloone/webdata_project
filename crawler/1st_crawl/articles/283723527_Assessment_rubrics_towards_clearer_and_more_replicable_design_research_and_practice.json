{"id":"283723527_Assessment_rubrics_towards_clearer_and_more_replicable_design_research_and_practice","abstract":"‘Rubric’ is a term with a variety of meanings. As the use of rubrics has increased both in research and practice, the term has come to represent divergent practices. These range from secret scoring sheets held by teachers to holistic student-developed articulations of quality. Rubrics are evaluated, mandated, embraced and resisted based on often imprecise and inconsistent understandings of the term. This paper provides a synthesis of the diversity of rubrics, and a framework for researchers and practitioners to be clearer about what they mean when they say ‘rubric’. Fourteen design elements or decision points are identified that make one rubric different from another. This framework subsumes previous attempts to categorise rubrics, and should provide more precision to rubric discussions and debate, as well as supporting more replicable research and practice.","authors":["Phillip Dawson"],"meta":["November 2015Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education","DOI:10.1080/02602938.2015.1111294"],"references":["291445101_Facts_are_more_important_than_novelty_Replication_in_the_educational_sciences","277405417_Assessing_Higher_Education_Teachers_through_Peer_Assistance_and_Review","276855955_Sustainable_assessment_revisited","268522706_Facts_Are_More_Important_Than_Novelty","263143228_Comparing_student_learning_experiences_of_in-text_commentary_and_rubric-articulated_feedback_Strategies_for_formative_assessment","321609556_Assessment_Learning_and_Judgement_in_Higher_Education","312449860_A_review_of_rubric_use_in_higher_education","305688123_Teaching_for_Quality_Learning_at_University","290940745_What's_still_wrong_with_rubrics_Focusing_on_the_consistency_of_performance_criteria_across_scale_levels","285817023_What's_wrong-and_what's_right-with_rubrics"]}
