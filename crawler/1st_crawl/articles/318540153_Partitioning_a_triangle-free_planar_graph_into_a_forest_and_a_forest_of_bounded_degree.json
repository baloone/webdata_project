{"id":"318540153_Partitioning_a_triangle-free_planar_graph_into_a_forest_and_a_forest_of_bounded_degree","abstract":"An (F,Fd)-partition of a graph is a vertex-partition into two sets F and Fd such that the graph induced by F is a forest and the one induced by Fd is a forest with maximum degree at most d. We prove that every triangle-free planar graph admits an (F,F5)-partition. Moreover we show that if for some integer d there exists a triangle-free planar graph that does not admit an (F,Fd)-partition, then it is an NP-complete problem to decide whether a triangle-free planar graph admits such a partition.","authors":["Fran√ßois Dross","Mickael Montassier","Alexandre Pinlou"],"meta":["July 2017European Journal of Combinatorics 66(1)","DOI:10.1016/j.ejc.2017.06.014"],"references":["265355357_On_the_partition_of_a_planar_graph_of_girth_5_into_an_empty_and_an_acyclic_subgraph","285344777_Decomposing_planar_graphs_of_girth_5_into_an_edgeless_and_acyclic_subgraphs","284301121_Proof_of_Grunbaum's_conjecture_on_acyclic_5-colorability_of_plane_graphs","248859292_Every_planar_map_is_4_-_colorable_-_2_Reducibility","248838938_Every_planar_map_is_4_-_colorable_-_1_Discharging","248664435_Every_planar_map_is_four_colorable_Part_II_Reducibility","248664431_Every_planar_map_is_four_colorable_Part_I_Discharging","237012800_Near-Colorings_Non-Colorable_Graphs_and_NP-Completeness","229598798_On_the_linear_vertex-arboricity_of_a_planar_graph","223143931_On_the_vertex-arboricity_of_planar_graphs","222294865_Decomposing_a_Planar_Graph_into_Degenerate_Graphs","220078856_Decomposing_a_Planar_Graph_into_an_Independent_Set_and_a_3-Degenerate_Graph","31192018_The_Point-Arboricity_of_Planar_Graphs"]}
