{"id":"313108728_Gonitonet_-_open_platform_for_research_competition_cooperation_and_reproducibility","abstract":"This paper presents the idea of applying an open source, web-based platform – Gonito.net – for hosting challenges for researchers in the field of natural language processing. Researchers are encouraged to compete in well-defined tasks by developing tools and running them on provided test data. The researcher who submits the best results becomes the winner of the challenge. Apart from the competition, Gonito.net also enables collaboration among researchers by means of source code sharing mechanisms. Gonito.net itself is fully open source, i.e. its source is available for download and compilation, as well as a running instance of the system, available at gonito.net. The key design feature of Gonito.net is using Git for managing solutions of problems submitted by competitors. This allows for research transparency and reproducibility.","authors":["Filip Graliński","Rafał Jaworski","Łukasz Borchmann","Piotr Wierzchoń"],"meta":["January 2016","Conference: 4REAL Workshop: Workshop on Research Results Reproducibility and Resources Citation in Science and Technology of Language"],"references":["337032768_PROB_A_tool_for_Tracking_Provenance_and_Reproducibility_of_Big_Data_Experiments","280912604_Faithful_Performance_Prediction_of_a_Dynamic_Task-Based_Runtime_System_for_Heterogeneous_Multi-Core_Architectures","264680123_Modeling_and_Simulation_of_a_Dynamic_Task-Based_Runtime_System_for_Heterogeneous_Multi-Core_Architectures","235755034_Git_can_facilitate_greater_reproducibility_and_increased_transparency_in_science","51969319_Scikit-learn_Machine_Learning_in_Python","337032612_PROB_A_tool_for_Tracking_Provenance_and_Reproducibility_of_Big_Data_Experiments","309240791_git_can_facilitate_greater_reproducibility_and_increased_transparency_in_science","276259494_An_Effective_Git_And_Org-Mode_Based_Workflow_For_Reproducible_Research","3248276_Version_Control_Systems"]}
