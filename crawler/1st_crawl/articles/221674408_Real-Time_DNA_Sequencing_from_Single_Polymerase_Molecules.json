{"id":"221674408_Real-Time_DNA_Sequencing_from_Single_Polymerase_Molecules","abstract":"We present single-molecule, real-time sequencing data obtained from a DNA polymerase performing uninterrupted template-directed\nsynthesis using four distinguishable fluorescently labeled deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs). We detected the temporal\norder of their enzymatic incorporation into a growing DNA strand with zero-mode waveguide nanostructure arrays, which provide\noptical observation volume confinement and enable parallel, simultaneous detection of thousands of single-molecule sequencing\nreactions. Conjugation of fluorophores to the terminal phosphate moiety of the dNTPs allows continuous observation of DNA\nsynthesis over thousands of bases without steric hindrance. The data report directly on polymerase dynamics, revealing distinct\npolymerization states and pause sites corresponding to DNA secondary structure. Sequence data were aligned with the known\nreference sequence to assay biophysical parameters of polymerization for each template position. Consensus sequences were\ngenerated from the single-molecule reads at 15-fold coverage, showing a median accuracy of 99.3%, with no systematic error\nbeyond fluorophore-dependent error rates.","authors":["John Eid","Adrian Fehr","Jeremy Gray","Khai Luong"],"meta":["January 2010Science 323(5910):133-138","DOI:10.1126/science.1162986","SourcePubMed"],"references":["348271218_Highly_Efficient_DNA_Synthesis_by_the_Phage_ph_29_DNA_Polymerase","241593946_Challenges_and_innovations_in_very-large_CCD_and_CMOS_imagers_for_professional_imaging","228349791_Improved_fabrication_of_zero-mode_waveguides_for_single-molecule_detection","23178967_Long_Processive_Enzymatic_DNA_Synthesis_Using_100_Dye-Labeled_Terminal_Phosphate-Linked_Nucleotides","20658463_Highly_efficient_DNA_synthesis_by_the_phage_PH29_DNA_polymerase_Symmetrical_mode_of_DNA_replication","242588759_Diffraction_Grating_Handbook","234274973_An_optimal_extraction_algorithm_for_CCD_spectroscopy","228057969_Algorithms_on_Stings_Trees_and_Sequences","222430526_CMOS_image_sensors_State-of-the-art","22865474_DNA_Sequencing_With_Chain_Terminating_Inhibitors"]}
