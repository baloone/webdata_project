{"id":"313395238_Multi-Message_Private_Information_Retrieval_Capacity_Results_and_Near-Optimal_Schemes","abstract":"We consider the problem of multi-message private information retrieval (MPIR) from $N$ non-communicating replicated databases. In MPIR, the user is interested in retrieving $P$ messages out of $M$ stored messages without leaking the identity of the retrieved messages. The information-theoretic sum capacity of MPIR $C_s^P$ is the maximum number of desired message symbols that can be retrieved privately per downloaded symbol. For the case $P \\geq \\frac{M}{2}$, we determine the exact sum capacity of MPIR as $C_s^P=\\frac{1}{1+\\frac{M-P}{PN}}$. The achievable scheme in this case is based on downloading MDS-coded mixtures of all messages. For $P \\leq \\frac{M}{2}$, we develop lower and upper bounds for all $M,P,N$. These bounds match if the total number of messages $M$ is an integer multiple of the number of desired messages $P$, i.e., $\\frac{M}{P} \\in \\mathbb{N}$. In this case, $C_s^P=\\frac{1-\\frac{1}{N}}{1-(\\frac{1}{N})^{M/P}}$. The achievable scheme in this case generalizes the single-message capacity achieving scheme to have unbalanced number of stages per round of download. For all the remaining cases, the difference between the lower and upper bound is at most $0.0082$, which occurs for $M=5$, $P=2$, $N=2$. Our results indicate that joint retrieval of desired messages is more efficient than successive use of single-message retrieval schemes.","authors":["Karim Banawan","Sennur Ulukus"],"meta":["February 2017IEEE Transactions on Information Theory PP(99)","DOI:10.1109/TIT.2018.2828310","Project: Private Information Retrieval in Networks"],"references":["309738770_Private_Information_Retrieval_from_Coded_Databases_with_Colluding_Servers","308646460_The_Capacity_of_Private_Information_Retrieval_From_Coded_Databases","315967473_The_Capacity_of_Private_Information_Retrieval","313541969_The_Capacity_of_Symmetric_Private_Information_Retrieval","313450712_The_Capacity_of_Private_Information_Retrieval","309192227_Symmetric_Private_Information_Retrieval_For_MDS_Coded_Distributed_Storage","308980909_Optimal_Download_Cost_of_Private_Information_Retrieval_for_Arbitrary_Message_Length","308845811_Private_information_retrieval_for_coded_storage","306116355_Blind_interference_alignment_for_private_information_retrieval","306114773_Private_information_retrieval_from_MDS_coded_data_in_distributed_storage_systems"]}
