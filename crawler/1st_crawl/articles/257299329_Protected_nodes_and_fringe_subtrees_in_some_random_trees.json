{"id":"257299329_Protected_nodes_and_fringe_subtrees_in_some_random_trees","abstract":"We study protected nodes in various classes of random rooted trees by putting\nthem in the general context of fringe subtrees introduced by Aldous (1991).\nSeveral types of random trees are considered: simply generated trees (or\nconditioned Galton-Watson trees), which includes several cases treated\nseparately by other authors, binary search trees and random recursive trees.\nThis gives unified and simple proofs of several earlier results, as well as new\nresults.","authors":["Luc Devroye","Svante Janson"],"meta":["October 2013Electronic Communications in Probability 19","DOI:10.1214/ECP.v19-3048","SourcearXiv"],"references":["230805956_Protected_points_in_k-ary_trees","276083687_Asymptotic_Properties_of_Protected_Nodes_in_Random_Recursive_Trees","267150030_Branching_Processes_and_Their_Applications_in_the_Analysis_of_Tree_Structures_and_Tree_Algorithms","265943337_On_the_Number_of_2-Protected_Nodes_in_Tries_and_Suffix_Trees","265825946_A_Survey_of_recursive_trees","263471502_Limit_Laws_for_Functions_of_Fringe_trees_for_Binary_Search_Trees_and_Recursive_Trees","257294253_Asymptotic_distribution_of_two-protected_nodes_in_random_binary_search_trees","247818733_The_Continuum_Random_Tree_II_an_overview","244508674_The_Galton-Watson_Process_Conditioned_on_the_Total_Progeny","236263770_K-Protected_vertices_in_binary_search_trees"]}
