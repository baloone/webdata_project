{"id":"318128880_Rare_events_and_discontinuous_percolation_transitions","abstract":"Percolation theory characterizing the robustness of a complex network to a random damage of its nodes, permeates network science and has applications ranging from biology, to epidemic spreading, and complex infrastructures. Despite risk in general involves a study of large deviations, in percolation theory we still lack a theoretical approach able to evaluate the risk of collapse in response to rare configurations of the initial damage. Here we build a large deviation theory of percolation characterizing the response of a sparse network to rare events. This general theory includes the second order phase transition observed typically for random configurations of the initial damage but reveals also discontinuous transitions corresponding to rare configurations of the initial damage for which the size of the giant component is suppressed.","authors":["Ginestra Bianconi"],"meta":["July 2017PHYSICAL REVIEW E 97(2)","DOI:10.1103/PhysRevE.97.022314"],"references":["315894505_Collective_Phenomena_Emerging_from_the_Interactions_between_Dynamical_Processes_in_Multiplex_Networks","309283868_Redundant_interdependencies_boost_the_robustness_of_multilayer_networks","301873226_Network_dismantling","282220232_Anomalous_critical_and_supercritical_phenomena_in_explosive_percolation","279633303_Influence_maximization_in_complex_networks_through_optimal_percolation","266856643_Explosive_Synchronization_in_Adaptive_and_Multilayer_Networks","262452749_Network_Controllability_Is_Determined_by_the_Density_of_Low_In-Degree_and_Out-Degree_Nodes","261799377_Recent_advances_and_open_challenges_in_percolation","259314741_Percolation_in_Multiplex_Networks_with_Overlap","258100764_Complex_Networks_Structure_Robustness_and_Function","256488071_Containing_Epidemic_Outbreaks_by_Message-Passing_Techniques","235737561_Interdependent_Networks_Reducing_the_Coupling_Strength_Leads_to_a_Change_from_a_First_to_Second_Order_Percolation_Transition","235389338_Avalanche_Collapse_of_Interdependent_Network","226253082_On_Large_Deviation_Properties_of_ErdsRnyi_Random_Graphs","51939418_Percolation_Theory_on_Interdependent_Networks_Based_on_EpidemicSpreading","51247346_Explosive_Percolation_is_Continuous_but_with_Unusual_Finite_Size_Behavior","51117462_Controllability_of_complex_networks","51074354_Explosive_Synchronization_Transitions_in_Scale-Free_Networks","49752161_Explosive_Percolation_Transition_is_Actually_Continuous","46424316_Explosive_Percolation_via_Control_of_the_Largest_Cluster","43148428_Catastrophic_Cascade_of_Failures_in_Interdependent_Networks","26786476_Early-Warning_Signals_for_Critical_Transitions","23801750_Percolation_transition_and_distribution_of_connected_components_in_generalized_random_network_ensembles","12244402_Resilience_of_the_Internet_to_Random_Breakdowns","12008378_Breakdown_of_the_Internet_under_Intentional_Attack","2208186_Critical_phenomena_in_complex_networks","1821778_Error_and_Attack_Tolerance_of_Complex_Networks","315116617_Fluctuations_in_percolation_of_sparse_complex_networks","307472662_Optimal_Deployment_of_Resources_for_Maximizing_Impact_in_Spreading_Processes","273704243_Percolation_in_real_interdependent_networks","264920260_Networks_An_Introduction","262049877_Percolation_on_Sparse_Networks","235885714_Avoiding_a_Spanning_Cluster_in_Percolation_Models","226995392_Percolation_and_the_Potts_model","222983936_On_the_random-cluster_model_I_Introduction_and_relation_to_other_models","51498020_Explosive_Percolation_Is_Continuous","24201135_Explosive_Percolation_in_Random_Networks","12193020_Network_Robustness_and_Fragility_Percolation_on_Random_Graphs","1917614_Touchette_H_The_large_deviation_approach_to_statistical_mechanics_Phys_Rep_478_1-69","1851534_On_the_number_of_circuits_in_random_graphs"]}
