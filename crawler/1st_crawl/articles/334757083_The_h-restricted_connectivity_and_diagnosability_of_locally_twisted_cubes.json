{"id":"334757083_The_h-restricted_connectivity_and_diagnosability_of_locally_twisted_cubes","abstract":"The connectivity and diagnosability of a system or a network are two important measures. In 1996, Fàbrega and Fiol proposed the h-restricted connectivity of the network G = (V,E), which is necessary for (h,m)-diagnosability of networks. In 2016, Zhang et al. proposed the (h,m)-diagnosability of G that requires every component of G-S has at least (h - 1) nodes for S⊆V. The locally twisted cube LTQn is applied widely. There are many researches on LTQn. In this paper, we show that the h-restricted connectivity of LTQn is n-1/2h(h- 2n + 3) for n ≥ 5 and 0 ≤ h ≤ n-3, and m of the (h, m)-diagnosability of LTQn is n- 1/2h(h- 2n + 1) for n ≥ 5, 0 ≤ h ≤ n-3 in the PMC model and n ≥ 7, 0 ≤ h ≤ n- 3 in the MM* model, respectively.","authors":["Shiying Wang","Yunxia Ren"],"meta":["July 2019IEEE Access PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2931574"],"references":["317407078_The_Tightly_Super_3-Extra_Connectivity_and_Diagnosability_of_Locally_Twisted_Cubes","325479145_The_g-extra_connectivity_and_diagnosability_of_crossed_cubes","318870058_The_g_-good-neighbor_diagnosability_of_locally_twisted_cubes","318305770_The_Tightly_Super_2-extra_Connectivity_and_2-extra_Diagnosability_of_Locally_Twisted_Cubes","315910131_The_1-good-neighbor_connectivity_and_diagnosability_of_Cayley_graphs_generated_by_complete_graphs","315514633_On_g-good-neighbor_conditional_diagnosability_of_n_k-star_networks","313968386_The_2-good-neighbor_2-extra_diagnosability_of_alternating_group_graph_networks_under_the_PMC_model_and_MM_model","310734646_Fault-tolerant_embedding_of_complete_binary_trees_in_locally_twisted_cubes","309330267_The_2-good-neighbor_connectivity_and_2-good-neighbor_diagnosability_of_bubble-sort_star_graph_networks","308756893_Reliability_of_Complete_Cubic_Networks_under_the_Condition_of_g_-Good-Neighbor"]}
