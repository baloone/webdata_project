{"id":"310235318_Universal_Partial_Words_over_Non-Binary_Alphabets","abstract":"Chen, Kitaev, MÃ¼tze, and Sun recently introduced the notion of universal partial words, a generalization of universal words and de Bruijn sequences. Universal partial words allow for a wild-card character, which is a placeholder for any letter in the alphabet. We extend results from the original paper and develop additional proof techniques to study these objects. For non-binary alphabets, we show that universal partial words have periodic structure and are cyclic, and we give number-theoretic conditions on the existence of universal partial words. In addition, we provide an explicit construction for an infinite family of universal partial words over non-binary alphabets.","authors":["Bennet Goeckner","Corbin Groothuis","Cyrus Hettle","Brian Kell"],"meta":["November 2016Theoretical Computer Science 713(1)","DOI:10.1016/j.tcs.2017.12.022"],"references":["319126110_Border_correlations_lattices_and_the_subgraph_component_polynomial","318896504_On_universal_partial_words","301874046_On_universal_partial_words_over_binary_alphabets","300785850_Border_Correlations_Lattices_and_the_Subgraph_Component_Polynomial","220544588_Unavoidable_Sets_of_Partial_Words","220342863_Counting_Bordered_Partial_Words_by_Critical_Positions","220192621_Universal_Cycles_for_Combinatorial_Structures"]}
