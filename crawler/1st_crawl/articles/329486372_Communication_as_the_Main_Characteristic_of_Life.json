{"id":"329486372_Communication_as_the_Main_Characteristic_of_Life","abstract":"What does „communication“ mean in the context of life? This article will clarify that physical and chemical investigations of living organisms assemble important attributes, but if we remove communication from all interactions of living organisms, nothing would remain as living. This contribution will outline that life results out of three complementary interacting levels of communication, cell-cell communication, RNA stem-loop communication and virus communication. The biocommunication approach complements former molecular biology, genetics, and evolutionary theory and offers an integrative method to understand the most recent available empirical knowledge about natural communication and natural languages and codes. This opens a better chance of more efficient investigations based on an integrative understanding of all levels of all domains and finally leads to a new understanding of life.","authors":["Guenther Witzany"],"meta":["December 2018","In book: Handbook of AstrobiologyPublisher: CrC Press","Projects: Biocommunication and Natural Genome EditingVirus, communication and life"],"references":["344481672_Viruses_and_the_Evolution_of_Life","339783007_Evolution_of_Genetic_Information_without_Error_Replication","324034883_Editorial_Genome_Invading_RNA-Networks","322021363_Biocommunication_of_Archaea","344480363_From_Strange_Simplicity_to_Complex_Familiarity_A_Treatise_on_Matter_Information_Life_and_Thought","324370104_Bees_Their_Vision_Chemical_Senses_and_Language","324286028_Aspects_of_the_Theory_of_Syntax","323321456_How_to_Do_Things_with_Words","322913714_Toxins_Targets_and_Triggers_An_Overview_of_Toxin-Antitoxin_Biology","322371169_Astrovirology_Viruses_at_Large_in_the_Universe"]}
