{"id":"328777323_Real_time_control_of_urban_groundwater_levels","abstract":"This paper introduces the application of real time control in the urban groundwater levels management. Real-time control (RTC) of water systems has become an advanced methodology to fully use the available capacities of a water system. Real time control, which applied to regulate structures in urban water systems, can eliminate the need for major investments in water-systems infrastructure. However, since the latest developments in information technology and computer science, RTC has now become indispensable for integrated urban water management.","authors":["Hao Qian"],"meta":["November 2018IOP Conference Series Earth and Environmental Science 189(2):022032","DOI:10.1088/1755-1315/189/2/022032"],"references":["222516108_Real-Time_Control_of_Urban_Wastewater_Systems_-_Where_Do_We_Stand_Today"]}
