{"id":"313395168_Coloring_tournaments_From_local_to_global","abstract":"The \\emph{chromatic number} of a directed graph $D$ is the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of $D$ such that each color class of $D$ induces an acyclic subdigraph. Thus, the chromatic number of a tournament $T$ is the minimum number of transitive subtournaments which cover the vertex set of $T$. We show in this paper that tournaments are significantly simpler than graphs with respect to coloring. Indeed, while undirected graphs can be altogether \"locally simple\" (every neighborhood is a stable set) and have large chromatic number, we show that locally simple tournaments are indeed simple. In particular, there is a function $f$ such that if the outneighborhood of every vertex in a tournament $T$ has chromatic number at most $c$, then $T$ has chromatic number at most $f(c)$. This answers a question of Berger et al.","authors":["Ararat Harutyunyan","Tien-Nam Le","Stéphan Thomassé"],"meta":["February 2017Journal of Combinatorial Theory Series B 138","DOI:10.1016/j.jctb.2019.01.005"],"references":["227498376_The_circular_chromatic_number_of_a_digraph","220533283_Gallai's_Theorem_for_List_Coloring_of_Digraphs","266462274_Forcing_Large_Transitive_Subtournaments","266177913_Digraph_Girth_via_Chromatic_Number","263893955_Tournaments_with_near-linear_transitive_subsets","259538802_The_Erdos-Hajnal_Conjecture-A_Survey","256935857_Tournaments_and_colouring","220342753_Strengthened_Brooks'_Theorem_for_Digraphs_of_Girth_at_least_Three","220077487_The_dichromatic_number_of_a_digraph","51948111_Two_results_on_the_digraph_chromatic_number"]}
