{"id":"316947483_Visions_of_Computer_Science_Education_Unpacking_Arguments_for_and_Projected_Impacts_of_CS4All_Initiatives","abstract":"As momentum grows to expand K12 Computer Science (CS) education, associated public narratives often assume core questions about why CS should be taught to all students have been sufficiently answered. Having clarity around the core purposes that varied stakeholders are envisioning is critical to ensuring the coherence of CS4All initiatives. This study presents a framework examining the range of arguments for and projected impacts of CS education programs. Based on data drawn from a researcher- facilitated participatory knowledge building process involving 26 CS education stakeholders who articulated 161 arguments, we identify seven areas of impact present in arguments for universal CS education: (1) economic and workforce development, (2) equity and social justice, (3) competencies and literacies, (4) citizenship and civic life, (5) scientific, technological and social innovation, (6) school improvement and reform and (7) fun, fulfillment and personal agency. Findings show that individual arguments and visions for CS education often reference multiple impact areas. We intend for this framework to support reflection by CS education stakeholders to consider how their current initiatives index different ideologies about what CS4All projects are meant to achieve.","authors":["Sara Vogel","Rafi Santo","Dixie Ching"],"meta":["March 2017","DOI:10.1145/3017680.3017755","Conference: the 2017 ACM SIGCSE Technical Symposium"],"references":["333351036_How_Dewey_Lost_The_Victory_of_David_Snedden_and_Social_Efficiency_in_the_Reform_of_American_Education","324066308_Expanding_the_Pipeline_The_State_of_African-Americans_in_Computer_Science_The_Need_to_Increase_Representation","317239901_Young_people_ethics_and_the_new_digital_media_A_synthesis_from_the_GoodPlay_Project","313004329_Participatory_Knowledge_Building_Within_Research-Practice_Partnerships_in_Education","304662507_Organizing_for_Teacher_Agency_in_Curricular_Co-Design","292135485_Connected_learning_An_agenda_for_research_and_design","285208267_Interactive_Assessment_Tools_for_Computational_Thinking_in_High_School_STEM_Classrooms","274309848_Computational_Thinking","265996870_Architectures_for_Learning_A_Comparative_Analysis_of_Two_Urban_School_Districts","258135728_Instructional_Program_Coherence_What_It_Is_and_Why_It_Should_Guide_School_Improvement_Policy","241890864_Hacker_Literacies_Synthesizing_Critical_and_Participatory_Media_Literacy_Frameworks","228387067_Promoting_Transfer_by_Grounding_Complex_Systems_Principles","226382424_Thinking_in_Levels_A_Dynamic_Systems_Approach_to_Making_Sense_of_the_World","27298394_Making_Computer_Science_Minority-_Friendly","343364402_Running_on_Empty_the_Failure_to_Teach_K--12_Computer_Science_in_the_Digital_Age","329651466_Young_People_Ethics_and_the_New_Digital_Media_A_Synthesis_from_the_GoodPlay_Project","327252722_Anatomy_of_an_Enduring_Gender_Gap_The_Evolution_of_Women's_Participation_in_Computer_Science","306036036_Supporting_Improvements_in_the_Quality_of_Mathematics_Teaching_on_a_Large_Scale","301935430_An_Archive_of_Their_Own_A_Case_Study_of_Feminist_HCI_and_Values_in_Design","301705066_Bringing_computer_science_to_US_schools_state_by_state","290867463_A_Mid-Project_Report_on_a_Statewide_Professional_Development_Model_for_CS_Principles","266316482_Program_or_Be_Programmed_Ten_Commands_for_a_Digital_Age","265092259_The_Four-Phase_Model_of_Interest_Development","265092107_Confronting_the_Challenges_of_Participatory_Culture_-_Media_Education_for_the_21st_Century_Part_2","262260941_Script_Changers_Digital_Storytelling_with_Scratch","262240019_The_CS_principles_project","255573999_Stuck_in_the_Shallow_End_Education_Race_and_Computing","253193591_Young_People_Ethics_and_the_New_Digital_Media_A_Synthesis_from_the_Good_Play_Project_22208","250265487_Computer_as_Paint_Brush_Technology_Play_and_the_Creative_Society","241646757_Organizing_Research_and_Development_at_the_Intersection_of_Learning_Implementation_and_Design","235994472_Routledge_International_Handbook_of_Participatory_Design","235930814_The_Coding_Manual_for_Qualitative_Research","228139713_Why_Hackers_Do_What_They_Do_Understanding_Motivation_and_Effort_in_FreeOpen_Source_Software_Projects","220094547_Exploring_Computer_Science_A_Case_Study_of_School_Reform","201381775_Experience_And_Education","40421656_Organizing_Schools_for_Improvement_Lessons_from_Chicago"]}
