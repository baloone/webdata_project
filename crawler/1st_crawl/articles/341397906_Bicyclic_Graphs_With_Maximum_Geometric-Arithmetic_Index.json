{"id":"341397906_Bicyclic_Graphs_With_Maximum_Geometric-Arithmetic_Index","abstract":"Let G be a simple graph with vertex set V (G) and edge set E(G). The geometric-arithmetic index (GA index for short) of graph G is defined as GA(G) = P uv∈E(G) 2 √ dudv du+dv , where the summation extends over all edges uv of G, and du denotes the degree of vertex u in G. Recently, Du et al. [On geometric arithmetic indices of (molecular) trees, unicyclic graphs and bicyclic graphs, MATCH Commun. Math. Comput. Chem. 66 (2011), 681-697] determined the first six maximum values for the GA indices of bicyclic graphs. In this paper, we determine the n-vertex bicyclic graphs with the seventh and eighth for n ≥ 9, the ninth, tenth, eleventh for n ≥ 10, the twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth, sixteenth for n ≥ 11, the seventeenth, eighteenth, nineteenth, twentieth, twenty-first, twenty-second, twenty-third, twenty-forth and twenty-fifth for n ≥ 12 maximum GA indices.","authors":["Roslan Hasni","Nor Hafizah Md Husin"],"meta":["February 2020Applied Mathematics E - Notes 20:8-32"],"references":["322661864_Maximum_and_Second_Maximum_of_Geometric-Arithmetic_Index_of_Tricyclic_Graphs","319152765_On_extremum_geometric-arithmetic_indices_of_molecular_trees","276354026_Maximum_and_Second_Maximum_of_Randic_Index_in_the_Class_of_Tricyclic_Graphs","267109472_On_geometric-arithmetic_indices_of_molecular_trees_unicyclic_graphs_and_bicyclic_graphs","227039013_On_geometric-arithmetic_index","319927758_The_geometric-arithmetic_index_and_the_chromatic_number_of_connected_graphs","267441382_Some_bounds_on_GA_1_index_of_graphs","243839434_On_Randic_indices_of_trees_unicyclic_graphs_and_bicyclic_graphs","233853526_Handbook_of_molecular_descriptors_WileyVCH_Weinheim","231473566_On_Characterization_of_Molecular_Branching"]}
