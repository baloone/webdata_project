{"id":"240995958_The_Input-Transform-Outcome_ITO_Model_of_a_Project","abstract":"This chapter sets the foundations for a rigorous approach to projects and programmes by highlighting the critical importance\nof target outcomes and explaining how inputs (economic resources), processes (work), outputs (products) and outcomes (end\neffects) are related. The Input-Transform-Outcome (ITO) model seeks to describe the mechanisms by which outcomes are generated\nfrom outputs and, (as a by-product) how the two concepts are distinguished. This framework is later applied to all of the\nphases that define the life of a project, from initiation to outcome realisation. Throughout the following discussion, terms\nare used in very precise ways, based on the comprehensive integrated glossary, provided in Appendix B.","authors":["Ofer Zwikael","John Smyrk"],"meta":["January 2011","DOI:10.1007/978-1-84996-516-3_2","Project: Project benefits management"],"references":["311787997_Making_projects_critical_An_introduction","286194303_Project_Management_for_the_Creation_of_Organisational_Value","273194886_Product_Development_Tensions_Exploring_Contrasting_Styles_of_Project_Management","324998503_Technology-Information_Processing_Fit_and_the_Performance_of_RD_Project_Groups_A_Test_of_Contingency_Theory","312985464_Building_theories_from_case_study_research","311366615_Strategic_Factor_Markets_Expectations_Luck_and_Business_Strategy","296819908_Competing_on_resources","288150921_Towards_a_comprehensive_understanding_of_public_private_partnerships_for_infrastructure_development","280141571_The_co-evolution_of_organizational_value_capture_value_creation_and_sustainable_advantage","278895800_Selected_excerpts_from_project_management_A_managerial_approach"]}
