{"id":"287368677_On_derandomizing_algorithms_that_err_extremely_rarely","abstract":"Does derandomization of probabilistic algorithms become easier when the number of \"bad\" random inputs is extremely small?\nIn relation to the above question, we put forward the following quantified derandomization challenge: For a class of circuits C (e.g., P/poly or AC⁰, AC⁰[2]) and a bounding function B: N → N (e.g., B(n) = nlog n or B(n) = exp(n0.99))), given an n-input circuit C from C that evaluates to 1 on all but at most B(n) of its inputs, find (in deterministic polynomial-time) an input x such that C(x) = 1. Indeed, the standard derandomization challenge for the class C corresponds to the case of B(n) = 2n/2 (or to B(n) = 2ⁿ/3 for the two-sided version case). Our main results regarding the new quantified challenge are:\n1. Solving the quantified derandomization challenge for the class AC⁰ and every sub-exponential bounding function (e.g., B(n) = exp(n0.999)).\n2. Showing that solving the quantified derandomization challenge for the class AC⁰[2] and any sub-exponential bounding function (e.g., B(n) = exp(n0.001)), implies solving the standard derandomization challenge for the class AC⁰[2] (i.e., for B(n) = 2ⁿ/2).\nAnalogous results are obtained also for stronger (Black-box) forms of efficient derandomization like hitting-set generators.\nWe also obtain results for other classes of computational devices including log-space algorithms and Arithmetic circuits. For the latter we present a deterministic polynomial-time hitting set generator for the class of n-variate polynomials of degree d over GF(2) that evaluate to 0 on at most an O(2-d) fraction of their inputs.\nIn general, the quantified derandomization problem raises a variety of seemingly unexplored questions about many randomized complexity classes, and may offer a tractable approach to unconditional derandomization for some of them.","authors":["Oded Goldreich","Avi Widgerson"],"meta":["May 2014Proceedings of the Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing","DOI:10.1145/2591796.2591808"],"references":["225670921_Reducing_the_complexity_of_reductions","221590356_Derandomizing_Polynomial_Identity_Tests_Means_Proving_Circuit_Lower_Bounds","220555325_Computational_complexity_A_conceptual_perspective","220345678_Efficient_approximation_of_product_distributions","51916767_A_Satisfiability_Algorithm_for_AC0","2814097_Three_XOR-Lemmas_---_An_Exposition","2596505_Reducing_the_Complexity_of_Reductions","316519975_Approximate_counting_with_uniform_constant_depth_circuits","312628314_The_complexity_of_constructing_pseudorandom_generators_from_hard_functions","273674251_The_Knowledge_Complexity_of_Interactive_Proof_Systems","268458711_A_Derandomized_Switching_Lemma_and_an_Improved_Derandomization_of_AC0","256268741_RL_subseteq_SC","243768733_A_switching_lemma_primer","242807208_-Formulae_on_Finite_Structures","242627726_Rackoff_the_knowledge_complexity_of_interactive_proof_systems","242356818_Z_formulae_on_finite_structures","242306588_Boolean_Function_Complexity_Advances_and_Frontiers","239328530_A_fast_and_simple_randomized_algorithm_for_maximum_indepedent_set_problem","237197796_Pseudorandomness_for_Regular_Branching_Programs_via_Fourier_Analysis","235008694_How_to_generate_cryptographically_strong_sequences_of_pseudorandom_bits","235008641_Theory_and_Applications_of_Trapdoor_Functions","235008639_Hardness_vs_randomness","234807273_Pseudorandom_generators_for_space_bounded_computation","232633216_Simple_construction_of_almost_k-wise_independent_random_variables","231513058_Better_Pseudorandom_Generators_from_Milder_Pseudorandom_Restrictions","229764906_Addendum_to_simple_constructions_of_almost_k-wise_independent_random_variables","226102492_The_complexity_of_constructing_pseudorandom_generators_from_hard_functions","225761534_Improved_Pseudorandom_Generators_for_Depth_2_Circuits","224967876_DNF_Sparsification_and_a_Faster_Deterministic_Counting_Algorithm","222790457_BPP_and_the_polynomial_hierarchy","222769125_On_the_power_of_two-point_sampling","222474720_A_fast_randomized_parallel_algorithm_for_the_maximal_independent_set_problem","222070582_Expanders_Randomness_or_Time_versus_Space","221590876_Trading_Group_Theory_for_Randomness","221499202_Simple_Constructions_of_Almost_k-Wise_Independent_Random_Variables","220693968_Computational_Complexity_A_Modern_Approach","220530683_Recent_Developments_in_Explicit_Constructions_of_Extractors","220467830_On_Approximate_Majority_and_Probabilistic_Time","220441949_Nisan_N_Pseudorandom_generators_for_space-bounded_computation_Combinatorica_124_449-461","220441383_Pseudorandom_bits_for_constant_depth_circuits","220139097_The_Sum_of_D_Small-Bias_Generators_Fools_Polynomials_of_Degree_D","220138290_Improved_Pseudorandom_Generators_for_Depth_2_Circuits","4355261_Theory_and_application_of_trapdoor_functions","4355018_Separating_the_polynomial-time_hierarchy_by_oracles","4355011_Deterministic_simulation_of_probabilistic_constant_depth_circuits","4351599_The_Sum_of_d_Small-Bias_Generators_Fools_Polynomials_of_Degree_d","2819949_Simplified_Derandomization_of_BPP_Using_a_Hitting_Set_Generator","2813380_Efficient_Approximation_of_General_Product_Distributions","2631399_Almost_Optimal_Lower_Bounds_for_Small_Depth_Circuits","2518888_Extractors_and_Pseudorandom_Generators","2512153_On_The_Power_Of_Two-Points_Based_Sampling","2454421_Randomness-Optimal_Oblivious_Sampling","2368934_Randomness_is_Linear_in_Space","2329655_Small-Bias_Probability_Spaces_Efficient_Constructions_and_Applications"]}
