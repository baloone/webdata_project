{"id":"318069208_Reference_point_specification_in_hypervolume_calculation_for_fair_comparison_and_efficient_search","abstract":"Hypervolume has been frequently used as a performance indicator for comparing evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO) algorithms. Hypervolume has been also used in indicator-based algorithms. Whereas a reference point is needed for hypervolume calculation, its specification has not been discussed in detail from a viewpoint of fair comparison. This may be because a slightly worse reference point than the nadir point seems to work well. In this paper, we tackle this issue: How to specify a reference point for fair comparison. First we discuss an appropriate specification of a reference point for multiobjective problems. Our discussions are based on the well-known theoretical results about the optimal solution distribution for hypervolume maximization. Next we examine various specifications by computational experiments. Experimental results show that a slightly worse reference point than the nadir point works well only for test problems with triangular Pareto fronts. Then we explain why this specification is not always appropriate for test problems with inverted triangular Pareto fronts. We also report a number of solution sets obtained by SMS-EMOA with various specifications of a reference point.","authors":["Hisao Ishibuchi","Ryo Imada","Yu Setoguchi","Yusuke Nojima"],"meta":["July 2017","DOI:10.1145/3071178.3071264","Conference: the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference"],"references":["279274696_Balancing_Convergence_and_Diversity_in_Decomposition-Based_Many-Objective_Optimizers","275243880_A_New_Dominance_Relation_Based_Evolutionary_Algorithm_for_Many-Objective_Optimization","222030993_SMS-EMOA_Multiobjective_selection_based_on_dominated_hypervolume","3949503_Scalable_multi-objective_optimization_test_problems","3418989_MOEAD_A_Multiobjective_Evolutionary_Algorithm_Based_on_Decomposition","3418888_A_review_of_multiobjective_test_problems_and_a_scalable_test_problem_toolkit","315849145_Hypervolume_Subset_Selection_for_Triangular_and_Inverted_Triangular_Pareto_Fronts_of_Three-Objective_Problems","305685497_Experiments_on_Greedy_and_Local_Search_Heuristics_for_d_dimensional_Hypervolume_Subset_Selection","305274844_Performance_of_Decomposition-Based_Many-Objective_Algorithms_Strongly_Depends_on_Pareto_Front_Shapes","304005386_Greedy_Hypervolume_Subset_Selection_in_Low_Dimensions","292783577_Greedy_Hypervolume_Subset_Selection_in_the_Three-Objective_Case","290041283_Selecting_a_small_number_of_non-dominated_solutions_to_be_presented_to_the_decision_maker","284004639_The_Hypervolume_Indicator_Revisited_On_the_Design_of_Pareto-compliant_Indicators_Via_Weighted_Integration","282556641_A_Unified_Evolutionary_Optimization_Procedure_for_Single_Multiple_and_Many_Objectives","281339301_Pareto-_aggregation-_and_indicator-based_methods_in_many-objective_optimization","280851276_Optimal_m-Distributions_for_the_Hypervolume_Indicator_for_Problems_With_Linear_Bi-Objective_Fronts_Exact_and_Exhaustive_Results","279729680_Hypervolume_Subset_Selection_in_Two_Dimensions_Formulations_and_Algorithms","274263562_Behavior_of_Multiobjective_Evolutionary_Algorithms_on_Many-Objective_Knapsack_Problems","273296140_An_Evolutionary_Many-Objective_Optimization_Algorithm_Based_on_Dominance_and_Decomposition","267982364_An_Evolutionary_Many-Objective_Optimization_Algorithm_Based_on_Dominance_and_Decomposition","266656312_A_theoretical_analysis_of_volume_based_Pareto_front_approximations","266656111_Two-dimensional_subset_selection_for_hypervolume_and_epsilon-indicator","264427657_An_Evolutionary_Many-Objective_Optimization_Algorithm_Using_Reference-Point_Based_Nondominated_Sorting_Approach_Part_II_Handling_Constraints_and_Extending_to_an_Adaptive_Approach","261030283_Multiplicative_Approximations_Optimal_Hypervolume_Distributions_and_the_Choice_of_the_Reference_Point","222889399_Hypervolume-based_Multiobjective_Optimization_Theoretical_Foundations_and_Practical_Implications","45280500_HypE_An_Algorithm_for_Fast_Hypervolume-Based_Many-Objective_Optimization","3418737_Performance_Assessment_of_Multiobjective_Optimizers_An_Analysis_and_Review","2634673_Multiobjective_Optimization_Using_Evolutionary_Algorithms_---_A_Comparative_Case_Study"]}
