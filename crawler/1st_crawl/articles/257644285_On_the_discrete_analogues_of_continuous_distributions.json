{"id":"257644285_On_the_discrete_analogues_of_continuous_distributions","abstract":"In this paper, a new method is proposed for generating discrete distributions. A special class of the distributions, namely, the T-geometric family contains the discrete analogues of continuous distributions. Some general properties of the T-geometric family of distributions are obtained. A member of the T-geometric family, namely, the exponentiated-exponential–geometric distribution is defined and studied. Various properties of the exponentiated-exponential–geometric distribution such as the unimodality, the moments and the probability generating function are discussed. The method of maximum likelihood estimation is proposed for estimating the model parameters. Three real data sets are used to illustrate the applications of the exponentiated-exponential–geometric distribution.","authors":["Ayman Alzaatreh","Carl Lee","Felix Famoye"],"meta":["November 2012Statistical Methodology 9(6):589–603","DOI:10.1016/j.stamet.2012.03.003"],"references":["262800809_On_the_generalized_Lagrangian_probability_distributions","257810157_A_new_method_for_generating_families_of_continuous_distributions","255631488_Some_Aspects_of_Discrete_Hazard_Rate_Function_in_Telescopic_Families","285355849_Estimation_and_Model_Selection_for_More_Complex_Models","272709950_Studies_in_the_History_of_Probability_and_Statistics_XI_Daniel_Bernoulli_on_Maximum_Likelihood","268313037_A_Primer_on_Statistical_Distributions","267078000_A_New_Generalization_of_the_Negative_Binomial_Distribution","265455530_A_wide_class_of_discrete_distributions_and_the_associated_differential_equations","243044574_The_Discrete_Normal_Distribution","242797375_Approximate_MLE's_of_the_parameters_of_a_discrete_Weibull_distribution_with_type_I_censored_data","240924157_Discrete_Burr_and_discrete_Pareto_distributions","238799323_A_New_Discrete_Weibull_Distribution","228375807_Exponentiated_Exponential_Family_An_Alternative_to_Gamma_and_Weibull_Distributions","224581928_The_Discrete_Weibull_Distribution","222787892_Characterizations_of_a_discrete_normal_distribution","222010848_A_discrete_analogue_of_the_Laplace_distribution","44476701_Generalized_Poisson_Distributions_Properties_and_Applications","40941861_Loss_models_From_data_to_decisions_With_assistance_from_Gary_G_Venter","31190927_New_Techniques_for_the_Analysis_of_Absenteeism_Data","23634977_On_the_generalization_of_negative_binomial_distribution","23630824_Reliability_Measures_in_the_Discrete_Bivariate_Set-Up_and_Related_Characterization_Results_for_a_Bivariate_Geometric_Distribution","3152687_Discrete_Rayleigh_Distribution","3152481_A_discretizing_approach_for_evaluating_reliability_of_complex_systems_under_stress-strength_model","3151484_On_Estimating_Parameters_in_a_Discrete_Weibull_Distribution","2074598_Dilogarithm_Identities"]}
