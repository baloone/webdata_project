{"id":"311973070_Some_properties_of_coalgebras_and_their_role_in_computer_science","abstract":"This paper introduces basic theoretical knowledge of coalgebras in computer science. Coalgebras are, specifically in category theory, structures defined according to an endofunctor. For both algebra and coalgebra, a functor is a convenient and general way of defining a signature. We present practical usage of the coalgebras in an example.\nWe observe a behavior of a simple Sequencer developed in SLGeometry framework. We model its behavior with the simple program written in Python, and we describe its behavior within coalgebra of endofunctor. The computation of the values stored in internal states is performed coinductively. Our approach can be used in the teaching process of formal methods for young software engineers.","authors":["William Steingartner","Davorka Radakovic","František Valkošák","Pavol Macko"],"meta":["December 2016Journal of Applied Mathematics and Computational Mechanics 15(4):145-156","DOI:10.17512/jamcm.2016.4.16"],"references":["277676030_Generic_and_Standard_Database_Constraint_Meta-Models","228357100_Category_theory_for_linear_logicians","315751342_Einfuhrung_in_die_Kategorientheorie","277296934_Universal_Coalgebra_a_Theory_of_Systems","267147613_The_use_of_WPF_for_development_of_interactive_geometry_software","258572491_Generalizing_the_Extensibility_of_a_Dynamic_Geometry_Software","254817754_An_introduction_to_coalgebras_and_coinduction","244420575_CATEGORICAL_PROGRAMMING_WITH_INDUCTIVE_AND_COINDUCTIVE_TYPES","241248262_The_Extensibility_of_an_Interpreted_Language_Using_Plugin_Libraries","239560772_Categories_and_Computer_Science"]}
