{"id":"269876173_Computing_solutions_of_the_multiclass_network_equilibrium_problem_with_affine_cost_functions","abstract":"We consider a nonatomic congestion game on a graph, with several classes of\nplayers. Each player wants to go from its origin vertex to its destination\nvertex at the minimum cost and all players of a given class share the same\ncharacteristics: cost functions on each arc, and origin-destination pair. Under\nsome mild conditions, it is known that a Nash equilibrium exists, but the\ncomputation of an equilibrium in the multiclass case is an open problem for\ngeneral functions. We consider the specific case where the cost functions are\naffine. We show that this problem is polynomially solvable when the number of\nvertices and the number of classes are fixed. In particular, it shows that the\nparallel-link case with a fixed number of classes is polynomially solvable. On\na more practical side, we propose an extension of Lemke's algorithm able to\nsolve this problem.","authors":["Frédéric Meunier","Thomas Pradeau"],"meta":["March 2019Annals of Operations Research 274(2)","DOI:10.1007/s10479-018-2817-z","SourcearXiv"],"references":["278617461_A_Lemke-Like_Algorithm_for_the_Multiclass_Network_Equilibrium_Problem","269902039_The_Linear_Complementarity_Problem","265373346_Polymatrix_Games_with_Joint_Constraints","262164131_The_complexity_of_pure_Nash_equilibria","257480045_On_the_solution_of_affine_generalized_Nash_equilibrium_problems_with_shared_constraints_by_Lemke's_method","248694725_uniqueness_and_stability_of_traffic_equilibria","248146352_Traffic_equilibrium_and_variational_inequality","245534996_Some_Theoretical_Aspects_of_Road_Traffic_Research","243783492_The_Traffic_Assignment_Problem_for_Multiclass-User_Transportation_Networks","243134336_Settling_the_Complexity_of_2Player_Nash-Equilibrium","242932912_A_Traffic_Equilibrium_Model_of_Travel_by_Car_and_Public_Transit_Modes","242933045_Traffic_Equilibria_and_Variational_Inequalities","242929638_Computing_Economic_Equilibria_on_Affine_Networks_with_Lemke's_Algorithm","242454081_Algorithms_in_Combinatorial_Geometry","238806453_On_the_e-perturbation_method_for_avoiding_degeneracy"]}
