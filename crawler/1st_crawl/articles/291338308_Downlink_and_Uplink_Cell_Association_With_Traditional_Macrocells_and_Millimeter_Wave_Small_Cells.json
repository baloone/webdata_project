{"id":"291338308_Downlink_and_Uplink_Cell_Association_With_Traditional_Macrocells_and_Millimeter_Wave_Small_Cells","abstract":"Millimeter wave (mmWave) links will offer high capacity but are poor at\npenetrating into or diffracting around solid objects. Thus, we consider a\nhybrid cellular network with traditional sub 6 GHz macrocells coexisting with\ndenser mmWave small cells, where a mobile user can connect to either\nopportunistically. We develop a general analytical model to characterize and\nderive the uplink and downlink cell association in view of the SINR and rate\ncoverage probabilities in such a mixed deployment. We offer extensive\nvalidation of these analytical results (which rely on several simplifying\nassumptions) with simulation results. Using the analytical results, different\ndecoupled uplink and downlink cell association strategies are investigated and\ntheir superiority is shown compared to the traditional coupled approach.\nFinally, small cell biasing in mmWave is studied, and we show that\nunprecedented biasing values are desirable due to the wide bandwidth.","authors":["Hisham Elshaer","Mandar N.
