{"id":"325297002_Output-sensitive_Complexity_of_Multiobjective_Combinatorial_Optimization_Problems_with_an_Application_to_the_Multiobjective_Shortest_Path_Problem","abstract":"We are concerned with multiobjective combinatorial optimization (MOCO) problems. We attempt to fill the gap between theory and practice, which comes from the lack of a deep complexity theory for MOCO problems. In a first part, we consider a complexity notion for multiobjective optimization problems which derives from output-sensitive complexity. The primary goal of such a complexity notion is to classify problems into easy and hard problems. We show that the multiobjective minimum cut problem as well as the multiobjective linear programming problem are easy problems in this complexity theory. We also show that finding extreme points of nondominated sets is an easy problem under certain assumptions. On the side of hard problems, there are obvious ones like the multiobjective traveling salesperson problem. Moreover, we show that the well-known multiobjective shortest path problem is a hard problem. This is also the case for the multiobjective matching and integer min-cost flow problem. We also identify a class of problems for which the biobjective unconstraint combinatorial optimization problem is a barrier for efficient solvability.\nIn a second part, we are again concerned with the gap between theory and practice. This time, we approach the multiobjective shortest path (MOSP) problem from the practical side. For the application in the planning of power transmission lines, we need to have implementations which can cope with large graphs and a larger number of objectives. The results from the first part suggest that exact methods might be incapable of achieving this goal which we also prove empirically. This is why we decide to study the literature on approximation algorithms for the MOSP problem. We conclude that they do not scale well with the number of objectives in general and that there are no practical implementations available. Hence, we develop a novel approximation algorithm in the second part which leans to the exact approaches which are well tested in practice. In an extensive computational study, we show that our implementation of this algorithm performs well even on a larger number of objectives. We compare our implementation to implementations of the other existing approximation algorithms and conclude that our implementation is superior on instances with more than three objectives.","authors":["Fritz BÃ¶kler"],"meta":["April 2018","Projects: Practically Efficient Algorithms for Multiobjective (Combinatorial) Optimization ProblemsComputational Complexity of Multiobjective Combinatorial Optimization Problems"],"references":["309402695_Output-sensitive_Complexity_of_Multiobjective_Combinatorial_Optimization","308036255_Paradigms_for_Parameterized_Enumeration","301817769_Tree-Deletion_Pruning_in_Label-Correcting_Algorithms_for_the_Multiobjective_Shortest_Path_Problem","324350105_Understanding_Robust_and_Exploratory_Data_Analysis","321125568_Complexity_of_some_polyhedral_enumeration_problems","313085198_The_two-phases_method_an_efficient_procedure_to_solve_bi-objective_combinatorial_optimization_problems","309120661_A_polynomial_algorithm_in_linear_programming_in_Russian","303444218_Multiple_criteria_decision_making","284299207_Some_considerations_about_computational_complexity_for_multiobjective_combinatorial_problems","283559921_Paths_trees_flowers","281657889_The_inputoutput_complexity_of_sorting_and_related_problems","279968777_A_Parametric_Simplex_Algorithm_for_Linear_Vector_Optimization_Problems","279633150_Equivalence_between_polyhedral_projection_multiple_objective_linear_programming_and_vector_linear_programming","282997232_The_vector_linear_program_solver_Bensolve_--_notes_on_theoretical_background","282059174_A_survey_and_annotated_bibliography_of_multiobjective_combinatorial_optimization"]}
