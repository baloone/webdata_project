{"id":"284714323_Capturing_Best_Practice_in_Teaching_Introductory_Programming_Course_A_Case_Study_for_Non-Computer_Science_Students","abstract":"The aim of this study has been to capture successful experience in teaching and learning introductory programming course for non-computer science students. We describe and discuss our experiences on applying the preferred learning styles named “Framework Programming Learning Method (FPLM)” on students’ performance in the introductory programming course. We proposed FPLM to non-computer science students as an effective learning style of teaching introductory programming course. We explain on how the method is implemented, give examples and describe on how the method supplemented by other learning methods such as Problem-Based Learning (PBL). FPLM approach has been demonstrated to non-computer science undergraduate students program. According to our experience, the FPLM method increase commitment of the students and students’ performance is improved, which result in significantly lower failure rate for the final exam paper. In addition to computer programming, students also learn the generic skills in problem solving, group work, collaborative design work, independent study, and externalization of their knowledge.","authors":["Mohd NIZAM Osman","Mushahadah Maghribi"],"meta":["August 2015","Conference: Colloquium in Computer and Mathematical Science in Education 2015 (CCSME 2015)At: Star Complex, UiTM PerlisVolume: vol 1, ISBN: 978-1-329-35874-4","Project: RaspyAir: Self-Monitoring System for Wireless Intrusion Detection using Raspberry Pi"],"references":[]}
