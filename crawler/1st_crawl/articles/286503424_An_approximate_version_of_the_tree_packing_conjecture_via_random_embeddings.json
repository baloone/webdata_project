{"id":"286503424_An_approximate_version_of_the_tree_packing_conjecture_via_random_embeddings","abstract":"We prove that for any pair of constants ∈ > 0 and δ and for n sufficiently large, every family of trees of orders at most n, maximum degrees at most δ, and with at most (n2) edges in total, packs into K(1+∈)n. This implies asymptotic versions of the well-known tree packing conjecture of Gyárfás from 1976 and another tree packing conjecture of Ringel from 1963 for trees with bounded maximum degree. A novel random tree embedding process combined with the nibble method forms the core of the proof.","authors":["J. Böttcher","Jan Hladky","Diana Piguet","A.
