{"id":"271387809_Benchmark_model_to_assess_community_structure_in_evolving_networks","abstract":"Detecting the time evolution of the community structure of networks is\ncrucial to identify major changes in the internal organization of many complex\nsystems, which may undergo important endogenous or exogenous events. This\nanalysis can be done in two ways: considering each snapshot as an independent\ncommunity detection problem or taking into account the whole evolution of the\nnetwork. In the first case, one can apply static methods on the temporal\nsnapshots, which correspond to configurations of the system in short time\nwindows, and match afterwards the communities across layers. Alternatively, one\ncan develop dedicated dynamic procedures, so that multiple snapshots are\nsimultaneously taken into account while detecting communities, which allows to\nkeep memory of the flow. To check how well a method of any kind could capture\nthe evolution of communities, suitable benchmarks are needed. Here we propose a\nmodel for generating simple dynamic benchmark graphs, based on stochastic block\nmodels. In them, the time evolution consists of a periodic oscillation of the\nsystem's structure between configurations with built-in community structure. We\nalso propose the extension of quality comparison indices to the dynamic\nscenario. Additionally, we perform several tests on various algorithms which\nshow, unsurprisingly, that dynamic techniques are more suitable than static\nones to describe community evolution.","authors":["Clara Granell","Richard K.
