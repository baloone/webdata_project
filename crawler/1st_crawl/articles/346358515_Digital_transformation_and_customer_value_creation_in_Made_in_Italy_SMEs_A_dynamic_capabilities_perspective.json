{"id":"346358515_Digital_transformation_and_customer_value_creation_in_Made_in_Italy_SMEs_A_dynamic_capabilities_perspective","abstract":"This study examines the impact of digital transformation on customer value creation in the context of small and medium-sized firms (SMEs) operating in the Made in Italy sectors, with the aim of understanding how dynamic capabilities, as enabling mechanisms, may foster digital transformation. We use multi-case study research on the digital transformation of six Made in Italy SMEs, belonging to the food, fashion, and furniture design industries. The results show that, for the selected SMEs, digital instruments contribute to innovation of their business model, creating new distribution channels and new ways to create and deliver value to customer segments. The results highlight the relevance of sensing and learning capabilities as triggers of digital transformation. In addition to the theoretical contribution to the existing literature on digital transformation and organizational capability, this study provides some managerial implications for digital transformation in SMEs operating in the Made in Italy sectors.","authors":["Michela Matarazzo","Lara Penco","Giorgia Profumo","Quaglia Roberto"],"meta":["February 2021Journal of Business Research
