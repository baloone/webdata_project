{"id":"327362790_Ontology-based_generation_of_random_paths_between_two_points","abstract":"In the first part of our research, a novel computer algorithm has been proposed to generate random path between two points in space. Random path consists of finite number of randomly generated adjacent points that satisfy the condition: L(pipn) < L(pi-1pn). Where L(p1pn) is the length of the path between the two adjacent points p1 and pn. The algorithm has been coded and evaluated. Experiments showed that the randomly generated points were converged to the target point. The main importance of this method is the ability to generate paths between two points in real time, which cannot be predicted in advance. Points are generated, one at a time, where each point brings us closer to the target point. This contribution is applicable to many fields such as economics, engineering, robotics, computer science, military, and other fields of applied sciences. In this part of our research work, we tackled the problem from different aspects. An ontology has been developed that describes the domain of discourse. The aim is two folds; firstly, to provide an optimized generation of best points that are closer to the target point. Secondly, to provide sharable, reusable ontological objects that can be deployed to other projects. The ontology is designed to guide the process of generating acceptable points based on some criteria described in the ontology. Adding intelligence to the process has provided us with a better solution, in comparison with our previous results. Ontologies have been engineered and reused in many research projects across the globe with success. Our contributed solution can attract many applications in the various fields of applied sciences. One implication of the utilization of ontologies is that it remains poorly exploited field, which may have an impact on the adoption of ontology-driven technologies outside the academic community. We underpinned our solution by the initiation of several case studies that have been designed using and extending our work, and progressing very well. Initial findings are very encouraging and leading to the applicability of the proposed solution to real life cases.","authors":["Ahmad Tayyar","Mohammad Ali H.
