{"id":"323939754_Evaluation_of_the_Parallel_Performance_of_the_Java_and_PCJ_on_the_Intel_KNL_Based_Systems","abstract":"In this paper, we present performance and scalability of the Java codes parallelized on the Intel KNL platform using Java and PCJ Library. The parallelization is performed using PGAS programming model with no modification to Java language nor Java Virtual Machine. The obtained results show good overall performance, especially for parallel applications. The microbenchmark results, compared to the C/MPI, show that PCJ communication efficiency should be improved.","authors":["Marek Nowicki","Łukasz Górski","Piotr Bała"],"meta":["March 2018","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-78054-2_27","In book: Parallel Processing and Applied Mathematics (pp.288-297)","Project: HPDCJ - Heterogenous parallel and distributed computing  with Java"],"references":["275654065_Partitioned_Global_Address_Space_Languages","271646935_Problem_definitions_and_evaluation_criteria_for_the_CEC_2014_special_session_and_competition_on_single_objective_real-parameter_numerical_optimization","3985809_JESSICA2_a_distributed_Java_Virtual_Machine_with_transparent_thread_migration_support","317051232_Performance_Characterization_of_Parallel_Discrete_Event_Simulation_on_Knights_Landing_Processor","308902106_A_Comparative_Study_of_Application_Performance_and_Scalability_on_the_Intel_Knights_Landing_Processor","286925093_Parallel_Differential_Evolution_in_the_PGAS_Programming_Model_Implemented_with_PCJ_Java_Library","264120922_PCJ_-_Java_library_for_high_performance_computing_in_PGAS_model","233398415_Parallel_computations_in_Java_with_PCJ_library","4040516_Lightweight_transparent_Java_thread_migration_for_distributed_JVM"]}
