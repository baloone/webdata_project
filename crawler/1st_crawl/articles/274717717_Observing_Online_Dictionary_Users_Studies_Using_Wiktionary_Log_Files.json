{"id":"274717717_Observing_Online_Dictionary_Users_Studies_Using_Wiktionary_Log_Files","abstract":"We present studies using the 2013 log files from the German version of Wiktionary. We investigate several lexicographically\nrelevant variables and their effect on look-up frequency: Corpus frequency of the headword seems to have a strong effect on\nthe number of visits to a Wiktionary entry. We then consider the question of whether polysemic words are looked up more often\nthan monosemic ones. Here, we also have to take into account that polysemic words are more frequent in most languages. Finally,\nwe present a technique to investigate the time-course of look-up behaviour for specific entries. We exemplify the method by\ninvestigating influences of (temporary) social relevance of specific headwords.","authors":["Carolin MÃ¼ller-Spitzer","Sascha Wolfer","Alexander Koplenig"],"meta":["March 2015International Journal of Lexicography 28(1):1-26","DOI:10.1093/ijl/ecu029"],"references":["272453081_Reflections_on_Lexicographical_User_Research","265251983_Opportunities_and_limitations_of_user_studies","249689493_Wisdom_of_the_Crowd_or_Technicity_of_Content_Wikipedia_as_a_Sociotechnical_System","236789429_Compiling_a_lemma-sign_list_for_a_specific_target_user_group_The_Junior_Dictionary_as_a_case_in_point","232231802_Dealing_with_zero_word_frequencies_A_review_of_the_existing_rules_of_thumb_and_a_suggestion_for_an_evidence-based_choice","228344916_Do_dictionary_users_really_look_up_frequent_words_On_the_overestimation_of_the_value_of_corpus-based_lexicography","49249794_Studies_in_Dictionary_Use_Recent_Developments","16953028_Resolving_20_Years_of_Inconsistent_Interactions_Between_Lexical_Familiarity_and_Orthography_Concreteness_and_Polysemy","233493200_The_corpus_its_users_and_their_needs_A_user-oriented_evaluation_of_COMPARA"]}
