{"id":"316188436_User_Requirements_Elicitation_for_Universal_Access","abstract":"This Chapter discusses user requirements elicitation under a Universal Access\nperspective, based on a literature review of existing approaches and methods which are reported\nto have been used for user groups such as motor-impaired people, people with different sensory\ndisabilities, people with cognitive, learning or communication disabilities, children and older\npeople. The addressed method include brainstorming, direct observation, activity diaries and\ncultural probes, surveys and questionnaires, interviews, group discussions, emphatic modeling,\nuser trials, scenarios, storyboards and personas, prototyping, cooperative and participative\nmethods, as well as emerging approaches based on playing, arts, drama and literature.\nThis investigation provides an indication of the complexity of the issues involved in\nrequirements elicitation in Universal Access, and raises the need for further work in this area in\norder to systematically address the subject.","authors":["Margherita Antona","Stavroula Ntoa","Ilia Adami","Constantine Stephanidis"],"meta":["June 2009","In book: The Universal Access Handbook (pp.15-1 - 15-14)Chapter: 15Publisher: Taylor & Francis GroupEditors: Constantine Stephanidis"],"references":["254935079_Providing_Information_about_Older_and_Disabled_Users_to_Designers","246288993_Gathering_the_requirements_for_a_fall_monitor_using_drama_and_video_with_older_people","225528991_Developing_a_navigation_aid_for_the_frail_and_visually_impaired","225516794_Early_user_involvement_in_the_development_of_information_technology-related_products_for_older_people","221652334_The_ethnographically_informed_participatory_design_of_a_PDA_application_to_support_communication","221651991_Equipping_designers_by_simulating_the_effects_of_visual_and_hearing_impairments","221631298_Participatory_design_with_Individuals_who_have_Amnesia","221517509_Cooperative_Inquiry_Developing_new_Technologies_for_Children_with_Children","221515265_The_participatory_design_of_a_sound_and_image_enhanced_daily_planner_for_people_with_Aphasia","221441543_Storyboarding_an_empirical_determination_of_best_practices_and_effective_guidelines","221010173_Requirements_of_Users_with_Disabilities_for_E-government_Services_in_Greece","220878823_Computer_Support_for_Cooperative_Design_invited_paper","220606672_Painting_the_ideal_home_Using_art_to_express_visions_of_technologically_supported_independent_living_for_older_people_in_north-east_England","220606656_Involving_older_people_with_dementia_and_their_carers_in_designing_computer_based_support_systems_some_methodological_considerations","220606627_Representing_older_people_Towards_meaningful_images_of_the_user_in_design_scenarios","220302348_Electronic_Survey_Methodology_A_Case_Study_in_Reaching_Hard-to-Involve_Internet_Users","15566389_Qualitative_Research_Introducing_Focus_Groups","8547610_Universal_product_design_involving_elderly_users_A_participatory_design_model","2365460_The_Role_of_Children_in_the_Design_of_New_Technology","329645663_Making_Use_Scenario-Based_Design_of_Human-Computer_Interactions","291047287_Environmental_design_and_adaptation_to_the_visual_environment_of_the_elderly","284760517_The_human-computer_interaction_handbook_Fundamentals_evolving_technologies_and_emerging_applications_archive","248590293_A_Practical_Guide_to_Usability_Testing","248029725_The_Survey_Research_Handbook_Guidelines_and_Strategies_for_Conducting_a_Survey","247894232_The_Handbook_of_Focus_Group_Research","246667484_Learning_from_the_Field_A_Guide_from_Experience","245452914_Applied_Imagination_Principles_and_Procedures_of_Creative_Problem-Solving","243781527_The_meaning_of_children_in_culture_becomes_a_focal_point_for_scholars","242352361_Scenario-Based_Design_Envisioning_Work_and_Technology_in_System_Development","239589747_USERfit_A_Practical_Handbook_on_User-Centered_Design_for_Assistive_Technology","238684394_The_design_of_children's_technology","226139263_The_Role_of_Groupware_in_Requirements_Specification","223891182_KidReporter_A_user_requirements_gathering_technique_for_designing_with_children","222297382_New_product_development_by_eliciting_user_experience_and_aspirations","221990634_Methods_for_inclusion_Employing_think_aloud_protocols_in_software_usability_studies_with_individuals_who_are_deaf","221652160_Using_think_aloud_protocol_with_blind_users_a_case_for_inclusive_usability_evaluation_methods","221652149_Designing_assistive_technology_for_blind_users","221325049_User_Requirements_Analysis_A_Review_of_Supporting_Methods","220690061_Requirements_Engineering","220606780_Accessible_design_and_testing_in_the_application_development_process_Considerations_for_an_integrated_approach","220606592_Towards_co-design_with_users_who_have_autism_spectrum_disorders","220606531_Aspects_of_HCI_research_for_older_people","220468637_Handbook_of_interview_research_Context_method","220302591_What_Frustrates_Screen_Reader_Users_on_the_Web_A_Study_of_100_Blind_Users","200552994_The_Inmates_Are_Running_the_Asylum_Why_High_Tech_Products_Drive_Us_Crazy_and_How_to_Restore_the_Sanity","44104468_Virtual_Ethnography_Interactive_Interviewing_Online_as_Method","30873450_User_Centered_System_Design_New_Perspectives_on_Human-Computer_Interaction","10760819_Accessible_cell_phone_design_Development_and_application_of_a_needs_analysis_framework"]}
