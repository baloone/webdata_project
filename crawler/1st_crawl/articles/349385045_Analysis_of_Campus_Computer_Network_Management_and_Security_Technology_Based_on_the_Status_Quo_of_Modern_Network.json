{"id":"349385045_Analysis_of_Campus_Computer_Network_Management_and_Security_Technology_Based_on_the_Status_Quo_of_Modern_Network","abstract":"At present, with the comprehensive improvement of modern computer science and network literacy, people are increasingly demanding the quality of their lives and related rationality. Slowly, we will gradually find that the computer has now become an important unit in our lives [1] . It seems that without the support of computers, our lives cannot continue. It is precisely because of the development and application of computer networks that the current network security and management measures of some campuses in our country cannot keep up with the upgrading of computer technology. This situation will also lead to loopholes in computer network management and security. In a nutshell, computer network technology unites the space and time of our lives. It is an innovative process in the network age. However, we still need to pay attention to the security management of some campus networks and the enhancement of information technology.","authors":["Zhenguo Liu"],"meta":["February 2021Journal of Physics Conference Series 1744(4):042113","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/1744/4/042113"],"references":["338527626_Trust_Based_Cluster_Head_Election_of_Secure_Message_Transmission_in_MANET_Using_Multi_Secure_Protocol_with_TDES"]}
