{"id":"305322316_Canonicity_for_Cubical_Type_Theory","abstract":"Cubical type theory is an extension of Martin-L\\\"of type theory recently proposed by Cohen, Coquand, M\\\"ortberg and the author which allows for direct manipulation of $n$-dimensional cubes and where Voevodsky's Univalence Axiom is provable. In this paper we prove canonicity for cubical type theory: any natural number in a context build from only name variables is judgmentally equal to a numeral. To achieve this we formulate a typed and deterministic operational semantics and employ a computability argument adapted to a presheaf-like setting.","authors":["Simon Huber"],"meta":["August 2019Journal of Automated Reasoning 63(1)","DOI:10.1007/s10817-018-9469-1"],"references":["322153742_On_the_Decidability_of_Conversion_in_Type_Theory","301818646_The_Independence_of_Markov's_Principle_in_Type_Theory","301818628_Computational_Higher_Type_Theory_I_Abstract_Cubical_Realizability","312277897_Computational_higher-dimensional_type_theory","309738720_Cubical_Type_Theory_a_constructive_interpretation_of_the_univalence_axiom","304641287_Computational_Higher_Type_Theory_II_Dependent_Cubical_Realizability","285910634_A_model_of_type_theory_in_cubical_sets","268040756_The_equivalence_axiom_and_univalent_models_of_type_theory","257283426_An_intuitionistic_theory_of_types","221901263_On_Irrelevance_and_Algorithmic_Equality_in_Predicative_Type_Theory"]}
