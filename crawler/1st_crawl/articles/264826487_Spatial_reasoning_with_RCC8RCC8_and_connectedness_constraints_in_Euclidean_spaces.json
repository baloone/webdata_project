{"id":"264826487_Spatial_reasoning_with_RCC8RCC8_and_connectedness_constraints_in_Euclidean_spaces","abstract":"The language RCC8RCC8 is a widely-studied formalism for describing topological arrangements of spatial regions. The variables of this language range over the collection of non-empty, regular closed sets of n -dimensional Euclidean space, here denoted RC+(Rn)RC+(Rn), and its non-logical primitives allow us to specify how the interiors, exteriors and boundaries of these sets intersect. The key question is the satisfiability problem : given a finite set of atomic RCC8RCC8-constraints in m variables, determine whether there exists an m -tuple of elements of RC+(Rn)RC+(Rn) satisfying them. These problems are known to coincide for all n≥1n≥1, so that RCC8RCC8-satisfiability is independent of dimension. This common satisfiability problem is NLogSpace-complete. Unfortunately, RCC8RCC8 lacks the means to say that a spatial region comprises a ‘single piece’, and the present article investigates what happens when this facility is added. We consider two extensions of RCC8RCC8: RCC8cRCC8c, in which we can state that a region is connected , and RCC8c∘RCC8c∘, in which we can instead state that a region has a connected interior . The satisfiability problems for both these languages are easily seen to depend on the dimension n , for n≤3n≤3. Furthermore, in the case of RCC8c∘RCC8c∘, we show that there exist finite sets of constraints that are satisfiable over RC+(R2)RC+(R2), but only by ‘wild’ regions having no possible physical meaning. This prompts us to consider interpretations over the more restrictive domain of non-empty, regular closed, polyhedral sets, RCP+(Rn)RCP+(Rn). We show that (a) the satisfiability problems for RCC8cRCC8c (equivalently, RCC8c∘RCC8c∘) over RC+(R)RC+(R) and RCP+(R)RCP+(R) are distinct and both NP-complete; (b) the satisfiability problems for RCC8cRCC8c over RC+(R2)RC+(R2) and RCP+(R2)RCP+(R2) are identical and NP-complete; (c) the satisfiability problems for RCC8c∘RCC8c∘ over RC+(R2)RC+(R2) and RCP+(R2)RCP+(R2) are distinct, and the latter is NP-complete. Decidability of the satisfiability problem for RCC8c∘RCC8c∘ over RC+(R2)RC+(R2) is open. For n≥3n≥3, RCC8cRCC8c and RCC8c∘RCC8c∘ are not interestingly different from RCC8RCC8. We finish by answering the following question: given that a set of RCC8cRCC8c- or RCC8c∘RCC8c∘-constraints is satisfiable over RC+(Rn)RC+(Rn) or RCP+(Rn)RCP+(Rn), how complex is the simplest satisfying assignment? In particular, we exhibit, for both languages, a sequence of constraints ΦnΦn, satisfiable over RCP+(R2)RCP+(R2), such that the size of ΦnΦn grows polynomially in n , while the smallest configuration of polygons satisfying ΦnΦn cuts the plane into a number of pieces that grows exponentially. We further show that, over RC+(R2)RC+(R2), RCC8cRCC8c again requires exponentially large satisfying diagrams, while RCC8c∘RCC8c∘ can force regions in satisfying configurations to have infinitely many components.","authors":["Roman Kontchakov","Ian Pratt","Michael Zakharyaschev"],"meta":["December 2014Artificial Intelligence 217","DOI:10.1016/j.artint.2014.07.012"],"references":["276959705_Point_Set_Topological_Spatial_Relations","248670440_On_the_complexity_of_qualitative_spatial_reasoning_a_maximal_tractable_subclass_of_the_regional_connection_calculus","221562198_Computational_Properties_of_Qualitative_Spatial_Reasoning_First_Results","221393492_Interpreting_Topological_Logics_over_Euclidean_Spaces","221393453_A_Spatial_Logic_based_on_Regions_and_Connection","220816401_Topological_Inference","220812290_Qualitative_CSP_Finite_CSP_and_SAT_Comparing_Methods_for_Qualitative_Constraint-based_Reasoning","220687918_The_Classical_Decision_Problem","220574024_Recognizing_string_graphs_in_NP","220444929_Qualitative_Spatial_Representation_and_Reasoning_An_Overview","220443316_Extensionality_of_the_RCC8_Composition_Table","2902896_Decidability_of_String_Graphs","2650021_On_the_Complexity_of_Qualitative_Spatial_Reasoning_A_Maximal_Tractable_Fragment_of_RCC-8","2401760_Reasoning_About_Temporal_Relations_The_Tractable_Subalgebras_Of_Allen's_Interval_Algebra","285350971_Point_line_and_surface_as_sets_of_solids","284667632_Individuals_and_points","277500874_Reasoning_about_temporal_relations","275027621_Real_Algebraic_Geometry","251470850_Chapter_13_Qualitative_Spatial_Representation_and_Reasoning","243766149_General_Theory_of_Boolean_algebras_Handbook_of_Boolean_Algebras","238223261_Elements_of_the_Topology_of_Plane_Sets_of_Points","226117363_Determining_Consistency_of_Topological_Relations","223250726_Decidability_of_string_graphs","223153450_String_graphs_requiring_exponential_representations","222754553_String_graphs_II_Recognizing_string_graphs_is_NP-hard","222577908_Recognizing_String_Graphs_in_NP","221605280_Constraint_Propagation_Algorithms_for_Temporal_Reasoning","221393557_Spatial_Reasoning_with_Propositional_Logics","220812670_RCC8_Is_Polynomial_on_Networks_of_Bounded_Treewidth","220779161_Embedding_Planar_Graphs_on_the_Grid","220650290_Algebraic_approach_to_spatial_reasoning","220443838_Relations_Algebras_in_Qualitative_Spatial_Reasoning","220202387_Constraint_Networks_of_Topological_Relations_and_Convexity","220118616_On_the_complemented_disk_algebra","220040345_Point-set_topological_spatial_relations","38355951_A_Calculus_of_Individuals_Based_on_'Connection","38355734_Individuals_and_points","2808219_Maximal_Tractable_Fragments_of_the_Region_Connection_Calculus_A_Complete_Analysis","2805489_On_the_Complexity_of_Qualitative_Spatial_Reasoning_A_Maximal_Tractable_Fragment_of_the_Region_Connection_Calculus","2462348_A_Canonical_Model_of_the_Region_Connection_Calculus"]}
