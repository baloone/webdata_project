{"id":"352845771_Attribute_Driven_Temporal_Active_Online_Community_Search","abstract":"Almost all of the existing approaches to determining online local community are typically deliberated like-minded users who have similar topical interests. However, such methodologies overlook the prospective temporality of users’ interests as well as users’ degree of topical activeness. As a result, the consequential communities might have extremely lower active users. This research investigates how online social users’ behaviors and topical activeness vary over time and how these parameters can be employed in order to improve the quality of the detected local community. For a given input query, consisting a query node (user) and a set of attributes, this research intends to find densely-connected community in which community members are temporally similar in terms of their activities related to the query attributes. To address the proposed problem, we develop a temporal activity biased weight model which gives higher weight to users’ recent activities and develop an algorithm to search an effective community. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is justified using four benchmark datasets and compared with four other baseline methods. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework yields better outcomes than the baseline methods for all four benchmark datasets.","authors":["Badhan Chandra Das","Md Musfique Anwar","Md.
