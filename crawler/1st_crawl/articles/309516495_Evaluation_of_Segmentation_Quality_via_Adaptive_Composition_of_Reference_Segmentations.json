{"id":"309516495_Evaluation_of_Segmentation_Quality_via_Adaptive_Composition_of_Reference_Segmentations","abstract":"Evaluating image segmentation quality is a critical step for generating desirable segmented output and comparing performance of algorithms, among others. However, automatic evaluation of segmented results is inherently challenging since image segmentation is an ill-posed problem. This paper presents a framework to evaluate segmentation quality using multiple labeled segmentations which are considered as references. For a segmentation to be evaluated, we adaptively compose a reference segmentation using multiple labeled segmentations, which locally matches the input segments while preserving structural consistency. The quality of a given segmentation is then measured by its distance to the composed reference. A new dataset of 200 images, where each one has 6 to 15 labeled segmentations, is developed for performance evaluation of image segmentation. Furthermore, to quantitatively compare the proposed segmentation evaluation algorithm with the state-of-the-art methods, a benchmark segmentation evaluation dataset is proposed. Extensive experiments are carried out to validate the proposed segmentation evaluation framework.","authors":["Bo Peng","Lei Zhang","Xuanqin Mou","Ming-Hsuan Yang"],"meta":["October 2016IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TPAMI.2016.2622703"],"references":["261236491_Measures_and_Meta-Measures_for_the_Supervised_Evaluation_of_Image_Segmentation","259669792_Tree_Shape_Priors_with_Connectivity_Constraints_Using_Convex_Relaxation_on_General_Graphs","258140919_Vision_meets_robotics_the_KITTI_dataset","228377043_A_co-evaluation_framework_for_improving_segmentation_evaluation","226084449_Alignment_by_Maximization_of_Mutual_Information","225429811_Yet_Another_Survey_on_Image_Segmentation_Region_and_Boundary","221304909_Yet_Another_Survey_on_Image_Segmentation_Region_and_Boundary_Information_Integration","221259524_Parameter_Selection_for_Graph_Cut_Based_Image_Segmentation","221109968_Introducing_total_curvature_for_image_processing","220979777_An_entropy-based_objective_evaluation_method_for_image_segmentation","220744922_Natural_Image_Segmentation_with_Adaptive_Texture_and_Boundary_Encoding","220182700_Learning_to_Detect_a_Salient_Object","220182212_An_Experimental_Comparison_of_Range_Image_Segmentation_Algorithms","51855547_CPMC_Automatic_Object_Segmentation_Using_Constrained_Parametric_Min-Cuts","45821321_Contour_Detection_and_Hierarchical_Image_Segmentation","27355894_Distance_Measures_for_Image_Segmentation_Evaluation","6397810_Toward_Objective_Evaluation_of_Image_Segmentation_Algorithms","4351082_Graph_cut_based_image_segmentation_with_connectivity_priors","4260079_Image_Segmentation_by_Probabilistic_Bottom-Up_Aggregation_and_Cue_Integration","4260040_Learning_to_Detect_A_Salient_Object","4207400_A_Measure_for_Objective_Evaluation_of_Image_Segmentation_Algorithms","285807129_Mean_shift_A_robust_approach_toward_feature_space_analysis","263002356_Microsoft_COCO_Common_Objects_in_Context","255963696_Evaluation_of_Image_Segmentation_Quality_by_Adaptive_Ground_Truth_Composition","245323169_An_Empirical_Approach_to_Grouping_and_Segmentation","243773059_Efficient_Approximate_Energy_Minimization_via_Graph_Cuts","242420381_A_Method_for_Comparing_Two_Hierachical_Clusterings","231878192_Some_Generalized_Order-Disorder_Transformations","224725049_Scalable_discrepancy_measures_for_segmentation_evaluation","224529740_Complex_Wavelet_Structural_Similarity_A_New_Image_Similarity_Index","223839491_Edge_Detector_Evaluation_Using_Empirical_ROC_Curves","222857902_Comparison_of_Edge_Detector_Performance_through_Use_in_an_Object_Recognition_Task","222694605_Unsupervised_segmentation_of_natural_images_via_lossy_data_compression","222455149_Quantitative_evaluation_of_color_image_segmentation_results","222021385_User-Steered_Image_Segmentation_Paradigms_Live_Wire_and_Live_Lane","221996717_Objective_Criteria_for_the_Evaluation_of_Clustering_Methods","221618995_Segmenting_Scenes_by_Matching_Image_Composites","221618499_Similarity_by_Composition","221363536_Quantitative_Evaluation_of_a_Novel_Image_Segmentation_Algorithm","221346031_Comparing_clusterings_An_axiomatic_view","221305422_Category_Independent_Object_Proposals","221304171_Evaluating_Image_Segmentation_Algorithms_Using_the_Pareto_Front","221259634_Improving_Spatial_Support_for_Objects_via_Multiple_Segmentations","221110991_Image_segmentation_by_figure-ground_composition_into_maximal_cliques","220696178_Modern_Image_Quality_Assessment","215721562_Efficient_Graph-Based_Image_Segmentation","48210005_A_Linear_Framework_for_Region-Based_Image_Segmentation_and_Inpainting_Involving_Curvature_Penalization","37468806_Frequency-tuned_Salient_Region_Detection","4038368_Learning_a_classification_model_for_segmentation","3906161_A_Database_of_Human_Segmented_Natural_Images_and_its_Application_to_Evaluating_Segmentation_Algorithms_and_Measuring_Ecological_Statistics","3327793_Image_Quality_Assessment_From_Error_Visibility_to_Structural_Similarity","2941744_Interactive_Digital_Photomontage","3666115_Quantitative_methods_of_evaluating_image_segmentation","2334424_Performance_Criteria_for_Graph_Clustering_and_Markov_Cluster_Experiments"]}
