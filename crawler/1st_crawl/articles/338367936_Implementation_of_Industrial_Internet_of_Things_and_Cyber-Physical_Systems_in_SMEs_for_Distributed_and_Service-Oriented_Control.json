{"id":"338367936_Implementation_of_Industrial_Internet_of_Things_and_Cyber-Physical_Systems_in_SMEs_for_Distributed_and_Service-Oriented_Control","abstract":"Connectivity and interoperability are of central importance for the fourth industrial revolution to connect products, machines, people and the environment in a manufacturing system. They are the key concepts that make possible the Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) that ultimately represent a central entity of Industry 4.0. This chapter addresses the challenge of implementing IoT and CPS in SMEs focusing on the integration of information technology, which support data storing, collection and analysis with the operation technology supporting the creation of physical value. In this work, the conceptual development of such a network is presented based on the principles of distributed and service-oriented control systems for smart manufacturing in SMEs.","authors":["Rafael A.
