{"id":"322354691_On_the_infinitary_proof_theory_of_logics_with_fixed_points","abstract":"The subject of this thesis is the proof theory of logics with fixed points, such as the mu-calculus,linear-logic with fixed points, etc. These logics are usually equipped with finitary deductive systemsthat rely on Park’s rules for induction. other proof systems for these logics exist, which relyon infinitary proofs, but they are much less developed. This thesis contributes to reduce thisdeficiency by developing the infinitary proof-theory of logics with fixed points, with two domainsof application in mind: programming languages with (co)inductive data types and verification ofreactive systems.This thesis contains three parts. In the first part, we recall the two main approaches to theproof theory for logics with fixed points: the finitary and the infinitary one, then we show theirrelationships. In the second part, we argue that infinitary proofs have a true proof-theoreticalstatus by showing that the multiplicative additive linear-logic with fixed points admits focalizationand cut-elimination. In the third part, we apply our proof-theoretical investigations to obtain aconstructive proof of completeness for the linear-time mu-calculus w.r.t.
