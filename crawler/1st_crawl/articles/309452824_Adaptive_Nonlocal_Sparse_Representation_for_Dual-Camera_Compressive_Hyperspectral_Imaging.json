{"id":"309452824_Adaptive_Nonlocal_Sparse_Representation_for_Dual-Camera_Compressive_Hyperspectral_Imaging","abstract":"Leveraging the compressive sensing (CS) theory, coded aperture snapshot spectral imaging (CASSI) provides an efficient solution to recover 3D hyperspectral data from a 2D measurement. The dual-camera design of CASSI, by adding an uncoded panchromatic measurement, enhances the reconstruction fidelity while maintaining the snapshot advantage. In this paper, we propose an adaptive nonlocal sparse representation (ANSR) model to boost the performance of dualcamera compressive hyperspectral imaging (DCCHI). Specifically, the CS reconstruction problem is formulated as a 3D cube based sparse representation to make full use of the nonlocal similarity in both the spatial and spectral domains. Our key observation is that, the panchromatic image, besides playing the role of direct measurement, can be further exploited to help the nonlocal similarity estimation. Therefore, we design a joint similarity metric by adaptively combining the internal similarity within the reconstructed hyperspectral image and the external similarity within the panchromatic image. In this way, the fidelity of CS reconstruction is greatly enhanced. Both simulation and hardware experimental results show significant improvement of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art.","authors":["Lizhi Wang","Zhiwei Xiong","Guangming Shi","Feng Wu"],"meta":["October 2016IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TPAMI.2016.2621050"],"references":["269873317_Compressive_Hyperspectral_Imaging_With_Side_Information","262426026_A_Reconfigurable_Camera_Add-On_for_High_Dynamic_Range_Multispectral_Polarization_and_Light-Field_Imaging","236315674_Sparse_Unmixing_of_Hyperspectral_Data","224236796_Hyperspectral_Image_Classification_Using_Dictionary-Based_Sparse_Representation","49698224_Multiframe_image_estimation_for_coded_aperture_snapshot_spectral_imagers","42638738_Generalized_Assorted_Pixel_Camera_Postcapture_Control_of_Resolution_Dynamic_Range_and_Spectrum","6151802_Image_Denoising_by_Sparse_3-D_Transform-Domain_Collaborative_Filtering","5469222_Single_disperser_design_for_coded_aperture_snapshot_spectral_imaging","4156453_A_non-local_algorithm_for_image_denoising","3085823_Compressed_Sensing","308832296_High-speed_hyperspectral_video_acquisition_with_a_dual-camera_architecture","308810097_Image_denoising_via_adaptive_soft-thresholding_based_on_non-local_samples","307867219_Computational_Snapshot_Multispectral_Cameras_Toward_dynamic_capture_of_the_spectral_world","286323040_Optical_Imaging_and_Spectroscopy","285517037_Spatial-spectral_Encoded_Compressive_Hyperspectral_Imaging","271997121_Acquisition_of_High_Spatial_and_Spectral_Resolution_Video_with_a_Hybrid_Camera_System","271600987_Dual-camera_design_for_coded_aperture_snapshot_spectral_imaging","269634058_Robust_Uncertainty_Principles_Exact_Signal_Frequency_Information","261045745_Compressive_Coded_Aperture_Spectral_Imaging_An_Introduction","233995491_Nonlocally_Centralized_Sparse_Representation_for_Image_Restoration","222019104_The_Spectral_Image_Processing_System_SIPS-Interactive_Visualization_and_Analysis_of_Imaging_Spectrometer_Data","221110774_Non-local_sparse_models_for_image_restoration","51076047_A_Prism-Mask_System_for_Multispectral_Video_Acquisition","47679862_Computed-tomography_imaging_spectrometer_Experimental_calibration_and_reconstruction_results","24276668_Video_rate_spectral_imaging_using_a_coded_aperture_snapshot_spectral_imager","6645277_Image_Denoising_Via_Sparse_and_Redundant_Representations_Over_Learned_Dictionaries","2107851_An_Iterative_Thresholding_Algorithm_for_Linear_Inverse_Problems_with_a_Sparsity_Constrains"]}
