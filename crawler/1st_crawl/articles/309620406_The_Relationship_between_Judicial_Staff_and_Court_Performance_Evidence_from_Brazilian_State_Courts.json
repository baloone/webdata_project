{"id":"309620406_The_Relationship_between_Judicial_Staff_and_Court_Performance_Evidence_from_Brazilian_State_Courts","abstract":"To handle increasing caseloads, the judicial systems of several countries have adopted three main strategies: developing new standards and judicial procedures; investing in information and communication technologies; and hiring additional judicial staff. This paper investigates the impact of this third strategy on the performance of Brazilian courts. We use multiple regression analysis to test an array of related hypotheses about the complex interactions between the number of judicial staff and court productivity. The empirical research uses ten-year (2003-2012) data from 27 Brazilian courts. The main findings indicate that the number of judicial assistants has a positive influence on court productivity, and the number of assistants mitigates the positive relationship between court caseload and court productivity. The results are discussed and further studies are suggested.","authors":["Adalmir de Oliveira Gomes","Tomás de Aquino Guimarães","Luiz Akutsu"],"meta":["October 2016International Journal for Court Administration 8(1):12","DOI:10.18352/ijca.214","Projects: Administration of JusticeJudicial Performance"],"references":["285755369_Is_Sky_the_Limit_Revisiting_'Exogenous_Productivity_of_Judges'_Argument","246675898_Legal_Structure_and_Judicial_Efficiency_the_Lex_Mundi_project1","225532412_Greek_Appeals_Courts'_Quality_Analysis_and_Performance","223905467_Does_staffing_affect_the_time_to_dispose_cases_in_Greek_courts","50235259_Research_on_the_caseload_management_of_courts_methodological_questions","275930304_Why_so_Fast_Why_so_Slow_Explaining_Case_Processing_Time","229590904_Ladders_and_Bushes_The_Problem_of_Caseloads_and","228236800_Court_Output_Judicial_Staffing_and_the_Demand_for_Court_Services_Evidence_from_Slovenian_Courts_of_First_Instance","228196256_Effect_of_Workforce_Age_on_Quantitative_and_Qualitative_Organizational_Performance_Conceptual_Framework_and_Case_Study_Evidence","24073763_An_Assessment_of_the_Efficiency_of_Spanish_Courts_Using_DEA"]}
