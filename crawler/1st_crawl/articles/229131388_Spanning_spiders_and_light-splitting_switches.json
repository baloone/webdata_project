{"id":"229131388_Spanning_spiders_and_light-splitting_switches","abstract":"Motivated by a problem in the design of optical networks, we ask when a graph has a spanning spider (subdivision of a star), or, more generally, a spanning tree with a bounded number of branch vertices. We investigate the existence of these spanning subgraphs in analogy to classical studies of Hamiltonicity.","authors":["Luisa Gargano","Mikael Hammar","Pavol Hell","Ladislav Stacho"],"meta":["August 2004Discrete Mathematics 285(1-3):83-95","DOI:10.1016/j.disc.2004.04.005","SourceDBLP","Project: Optimization of Network Structures"],"references":["235057409_Hamiltonian_Results_in_Klr-Free_Graphs","228057554_On_Approximating_the_Longest_Path_in_a_Graph","221580898_Reducibility_Among_Combinatorial_Problems","2772679_On_Approximating_the_Longest_Path_in_a_Graph","2643361_Graph_Problems_Arising_from_Wavelength--Routing_in_All--Optical_Networks","285020294_Sur_une_propriete_des_arbres_maximaux_dans_un_graphe","265873426_Hamiltonian_results_in_K_1r_-free_graphs","256157473_A_note_on_Hamilton_circuits","246406246_Hypohamiltonian_and_Hypotraceable_Graphs","245256175_Algorithms_for_finding_low_degree_structures","243787873_Compexity_of_Computer_Computations","243764787_Some_Theorems_on_Abstract_Graphs","238125478_Note_on_Hamilton_Circuits","229758322_Hamiltonicity_for_K1_r-free_graphs","229747899_Longest_paths_and_cycles_in_K13-free_graphs","221591502_A_Matter_of_Degree_Improved_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Degree-Bounded_Minimum_Spanning_Trees","221590579_Finding_long_paths_and_cycles_in_sparse_Hamiltonian_graphs","220898341_There_Are_Spanning_Spiders_in_Dense_Graphs_and_We_Know_How_to_Find_Them","220897802_Spanning_Trees_with_Bounded_Number_of_Branch_Vertices","220616419_A_Matter_of_Degree_Improved_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Degree-Bounded_Minimum_Spanning_Trees","220406366_On_the_Approximation_of_Finding_Another_Hamiltonian_Cycle_in_Cubic_Hamiltonian_Graphs","220397933_A_Sufficient_Condition_for_a_Graph_to_Have_a_k-tree","220397707_Maximal_Trees_with_Bounded_Maximum_Degree_in_a_Graph","220077077_Planar_cubic_hypohamiltonian_and_hypotraceable_graphs","2810515_Routing_In_All--Optical_Networks_Algorithmic_And_Graph--Theoretic_Problems"]}
