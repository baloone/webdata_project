{"id":"267661316_Public_vs_Private_Coin_in_Bounded-Round_Information","abstract":"We precisely characterize the role of private randomness in the ability of Alice to send a message to Bob while minimizing the amount of information revealed to him. We give an example of a (randomized) message which can be transmitted while revealing only I bits of information using private randomness, but requires Alice to reveal I + logI − O(1) bits of information if only public coins are allowed. This gives the first example of an ω(1) additive separation between these two models. Our example also shows that the one-round compression construction of Harsha et al. [HJMR07] cannot be improved.\n\nMoreover, we show that our example is tight up to an additive O(1) factor: We show that if using private randomness a message can be transmitted while revealing I bits of information, the transmission can be simulated without private coins using I + logI + O(1) bits of information. This improves over an earlier result by Brody et al. [BBK+12].","authors":["Mark Braverman","Ankit Garg"],"meta":["July 2014","DOI:10.1007/978-3-662-43948-7_42","Conference: International Colloquium on Automata, Languages, and Programming"],"references":["346098241_Towards_a_Reverse_Newman's_Theorem_in_Interactive_Information_Complexity","261469585_Towards_a_Reverse_Newman's_Theorem_in_Interactive_Information_Complexity","260345188_From_Information_to_Exact_Communication","220679095_The_communication_complexity_of_correlation","220138459_The_Communication_Complexity_of_Correlation","4257934_The_Communication_Complexity_of_Correlation","304890870_Interactive_information_complexity","274891554_Elements_of_Information_Theory_Wiley_New-York","262424884_Direct_Product_via_Round-Preserving_Compression","222477337_Private_vs_common_random_bits_in_communication_complexity","222431754_An_Information_Statistics_Approach_to_Data_Stream_and_Communication_Complexity","221590591_How_to_Compress_Interactive_Communication","220690121_Communication_Complexity","220138207_Interactive_Information_Complexity","51912125_Information_Equals_Amortized_Communication","3921142_Informational_Complexity_and_the_Direct_Sum_Problem_for_Simultaneous_Message_Complexity"]}
