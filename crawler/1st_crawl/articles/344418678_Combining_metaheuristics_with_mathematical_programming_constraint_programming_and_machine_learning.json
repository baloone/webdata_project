{"id":"344418678_Combining_metaheuristics_with_mathematical_programming_constraint_programming_and_machine_learning","abstract":"During the last years, interest on hybrid metaheuristics has risen considerably in the field of optimization and machine learning. The best results found for many optimization problems in science and industry are obtained by hybrid optimization algorithms. Combinations of optimization tools such as metaheuristics, mathematical programming, constraint programming and machine learning, have provided very efficient optimization algorithms. Four different types of combinations are considered in this paper: (1) Combining metaheuristics with complementary metaheuristics. (2) Combining metaheuristics with exact methods from mathematical programming approaches which are mostly used in the operations research community. (3) Combining metaheuristics with constraint programming approaches developed in the artificial intelligence community. (4) Combining metaheuristics with machine learning and data mining techniques.","authors":["El-Ghazali Talbi"],"meta":["May 2016Annals of Operations Research 240(1):171-215","DOI:10.1007/s10479-015-2034-y"],"references":["297333288_Combinations_of_local_search_and_exact_algorithms","316517457_Practical_problem_solving_with_cutting_plane_algorithms_in_combinatorial_optimization","313766806_Genetic_hybrids_for_the_quadratic_assignment_problems","313202522_Effective_local_and_guided_variable_neighbourhood_search_methods_for_the_asymmetric_travelling_salesman_problem","312978874_Genetic_local_search_algorithms_for_the_traveling_salesman_problem","312940694_Network_optimization_problems","312579013_Using_constraint_programming_and_local_search_methods_to_solve_vehicle_routing_problems","295925039_Using_genetic_algorithms_for_setting_parameter_values_in_heuristic_search","286331966_The_performance_of_hybridized_algorithm_of_genetic_algorithm_simulated_annealing_and_tabu_search_for_thermal_unit_maintenance_scheduling","284685941_Branch_and_Price_Column_generation_for_solving_huge_integer_programs","277677057_Exact_and_Approximate_Nondeterministic_Tree-Search_Procedures_for_the_Quadratic_Assignment_Problem","268200953_On_Improving_Evolutionary_Algorithms_by_Using_Data_Mining_for_the_Oil_Collector_Vehicle_Routing_Problem","282674604_Practical_problem_solving_with_cutting_plane_algorithms_in_combinatorial_optimization","277289470_Adaptive_Memories_for_the_Quadratic_Assignment_Problem","266909770_Principles_of_constraint_programming_Reprint_of_the_2003_hardback_ed"]}
