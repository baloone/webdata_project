{"id":"275218895_A_New_Canadian_Interdisciplinary_PhD_in_Computational_Sciences","abstract":"In response to growing demands of society for experts trained in computational skills applied to various domains, the School of Computer Science at the University of Guelph is creating a new approach to doctoral studies called an Interdisciplinary PhD in Computational Sciences. The program is designed to appeal to candidates with strong backgrounds in either computer science or an application discipline who are not necessarily seeking a traditional academic career. Thesis based, it features minimal course requirements and short duration, with the student's research directed by co-advisors from computer science and the application discipline. The degree program's rationale and special characteristics are described. Related programs in Ontario and reception of this innovative proposal at the institutional level are discussed.","authors":["William Gardner","G. Grewal","D.A.
