{"id":"251566772_Algorithmic_Solvability_of_the_Lifting-Extension_Problem","abstract":"Let X and Y be finite simplicial sets (e.g. finite simplicial complexes),\nboth equipped with a free simplicial action of a finite group G. Assuming that\nY is d-connected and dim X is at most 2d, we provide an algorithm that computes\nthe set of all equivariant homotopy classes of equivariant continuous maps\n|X|-->|Y|; the existence of such a map can be decided even for dim X=2d+1. For\nfixed G and d, the algorithm runs in polynomial time. This yields the first\nalgorithm for deciding topological embeddability of a k-dimensional finite\nsimplicial complex into R^n when k is at most (2/3)n-1.\nMore generally, we present an algorithm that, given a lifting-extension\nproblem satisfying an appropriate stability assumption, computes the set of all\nhomotopy classes of solutions. This result is new even in the non-equivariant\nsituation.","authors":["Martin Cadek","Marek Krčál","Lukáš Vokřínek"],"meta":["June 2017Discrete & Computational Geometry 57(4)","DOI:10.1007/s00454-016-9855-6","SourcearXiv"],"references":["345951515_H-spaces_from_a_Homotopy_Point_of_View","280173086_Polynomial-Time_Computation_of_Homotopy_Groups_and_Postnikov_Systems_in_Fixed_Dimension","268551845_EqUivariant_cohomology_theories","266977667_H-spaces_from_a_homotopy_point_of_view","266226066_Fibrewise_Homotopy_Theory","265434721_Homotopy_Theories_and_Model_Categories","265433481_Homologie_des_espaces_fibres","265366705_On_the_groups_HPn_II","265358624_Equivalent_cohomology_theories","265325805_Finite_Computability_of_Postnikov_Complexes"]}
