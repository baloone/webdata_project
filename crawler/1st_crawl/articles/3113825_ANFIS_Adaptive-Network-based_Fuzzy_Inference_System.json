{"id":"3113825_ANFIS_Adaptive-Network-based_Fuzzy_Inference_System","abstract":"The architecture and learning procedure underlying ANFIS\n(adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system) is presented, which is a\nfuzzy inference system implemented in the framework of adaptive\nnetworks. By using a hybrid learning procedure, the proposed ANFIS can\nconstruct an input-output mapping based on both human knowledge (in the\nform of fuzzy if-then rules) and stipulated input-output data pairs. In\nthe simulation, the ANFIS architecture is employed to model nonlinear\nfunctions, identify nonlinear components on-line in a control system,\nand predict a chaotic time series, all yielding remarkable results.\nComparisons with artificial neural networks and earlier work on fuzzy\nmodeling are listed and discussed. Other extensions of the proposed\nANFIS and promising applications to automatic control and signal\nprocessing are also suggested","authors":["Jyh-Shing R Jang"],"meta":["June 1993IEEE Transactions on Systems Man and Cybernetics 23(3):665 - 685","DOI:10.1109/21.256541","SourceIEEE Xplore"],"references":["322276973_Identification_and_Control_of_Dynamical_System_using_Neural_Networks","317929367_Derivation_of_Fuzzy_Control_Rules_from_Human_Operator's_Control_Actions","313569292_Identification_and_control_of_dynamical_systems_using_neural_networks","311569941_Faster-Learning_Variations_on_Back-Propagation_An_Empirical_Study","302322490_Neural_Network_Analysis_of_Plasma_Spectra","290801940_Training_Multilayer_Perceptrons_with_the_Extended_Kalman_Algorithm_Advances_in_Neural_inform_Processing_Syst","285790192_Rule_extraction_using_generalized_neural_networks","284554360_Fuzzy_Control_and_Fuzzy_Systems","284462342_Fuzzy_Sets_Outline_of_a_New_Approach_to_the_Analysis_of_Complex_Systems_and_Decision_Processes","268647492_Introduction_to_Nonlinear_Optimization"]}
