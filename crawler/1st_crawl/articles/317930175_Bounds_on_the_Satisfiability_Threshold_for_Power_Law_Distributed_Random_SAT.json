{"id":"317930175_Bounds_on_the_Satisfiability_Threshold_for_Power_Law_Distributed_Random_SAT","abstract":"Propositional satisfiability (SAT) is one of the most fundamental problems in computer science. The worst-case hardness of SAT lies at the core of computational complexity theory. The average-case analysis of SAT has triggered the development of sophisticated rigorous and non-rigorous techniques for analyzing random structures. Despite a long line of research and substantial progress, nearly all theoretical work on random SAT assumes a uniform distribution on the variables. In contrast, real-world instances often exhibit large fluctuations in variable occurrence. This can be modeled by a scale-free distribution of the variables, which results in distributions closer to industrial SAT instances. We study random k-SAT on n variables, $m=\\Theta(n)$ clauses, and a power law distribution on the variable occurrences with exponent $\\beta$. We observe a satisfiability threshold at $\\beta=(2k-1)/(k-1)$. This threshold is tight in the sense that instances with $\\beta\\le(2k-1)/(k-1)-\\varepsilon$ for any constant $\\varepsilon>0$ are unsatisfiable with high probability (w.h.p.). For $\\beta\\geq(2k-1)/(k-1)+\\varepsilon$, the picture is reminiscent of the uniform case: instances are satisfiable w.h.p. for sufficiently small constant clause-variable ratios $m/n$; they are unsatisfiable above a ratio $m/n$ that depends on $\\beta$.","authors":["Tobias Friedrich","Anton Krohmer","Ralf Rothenberger","Thomas Sauerwald"],"meta":["June 2017"],"references":["283471149_Geometric_Inhomogeneous_Random_Graphs","264957849_Sharp_thresholds_of_graph_properties_and_the_k-SAT_problem","325677286_Random_graphs_and_complex_networks","300175516_Lock-Free_Algorithms_under_Stochastic_Schedulers","284359014_The_asymptotic_k-SAT_threshold","283617653_Emergence_of_Scaling_in_Random_Networks","283617410_Emergence_of_Scaling_in_Random_Networks","268721990_Theory_of_randomized_search_heuristics_Foundations_and_recent_developments","267760132_Proof_of_the_Satisfiability_Conjecture_for_Large_k","260971615_The_asymptotic_k-SAT_threshold"]}
