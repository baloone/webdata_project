{"id":"254243665_Students'_experience_of_synchronous_learning_in_distributed_environments","abstract":"This article reports on a two-year ethnographic study of learners participating in multi-site, graduate-level education classes. Classes sometimes met face-to-face in the same physical location; at other times part of the class met physically elsewhere. Yet all were linked through the virtual space. Ethnographic analysis of four data types explored how the instructor and students were able to interact through videoconferencing technologies. Most of the interaction occurred between the local and distance learners by way of cultural guides, local students assigned to host a distance learner through Google Video chat. The distance learners were able to receive real-time attention from the instructor and were able to share differing perspectives that contributed to increased satisfaction in the course. These interactions allowed for a dynamic collaborative effort among a diverse set of actors in the field of education.","authors":["Anissa Stewart","Danielle Boyd Harlow","Kim DeBacco"],"meta":["November 2011Distance Education 32(3):357-381","DOI:10.1080/01587919.2011.610289"],"references":["322644707_Ethnography_as_a_logic_of_inquiry","272681294_Interactional_Ethnography_An_Approach_to_Studying_the_Social_Construction_of_Literate_Practices","268347258_Culture_Can_you_Take_it_Anywhere","315386074_Communication_Needs_of_Online_Students","313668360_A_comparative_study_of_computer_conferencing_and_face-to-face_communications_in_systems_design","292774036_The_nature_of_educational_ethnography","285132319_Do_you_see_what_we_see_The_referential_and_intertextual_nature_of_classroom_life","277197718_Blended_Learning_in_Higher_Education_Framework_Principles_and_Guidelines","272160287_Participant_Observation","262158452_Communication_needs_of_online_students"]}
