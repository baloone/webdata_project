{"id":"317083802_Eigenfaces_vs_Fisherfaces_Recognition_Using_Class_Specific_Linear_Projection","abstract":"We develop a face recognition algorithm which is insensitive to\nlarge variation in lighting direction and facial expression. Taking a\npattern classification approach, we consider each pixel in an image as a\ncoordinate in a high-dimensional space. We take advantage of the\nobservation that the images of a particular face, under varying\nillumination but fixed pose, lie in a 3D linear subspace of the high\ndimensional image space-if the face is a Lambertian surface without\nshadowing. However, since faces are not truly Lambertian surfaces and do\nindeed produce self-shadowing, images will deviate from this linear\nsubspace. Rather than explicitly modeling this deviation, we linearly\nproject the image into a subspace in a manner which discounts those\nregions of the face with large deviation. Our projection method is based\non Fisher's linear discriminant and produces well separated classes in a\nlow-dimensional subspace, even under severe variation in lighting and\nfacial expressions. The eigenface technique, another method based on\nlinearly projecting the image space to a low dimensional subspace, has\nsimilar computational requirements. Yet, extensive experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed “Fisherface” method has error\nrates that are lower than those of the eigenface technique for tests on\nthe Harvard and Yale face databases","authors":["Peter N.
