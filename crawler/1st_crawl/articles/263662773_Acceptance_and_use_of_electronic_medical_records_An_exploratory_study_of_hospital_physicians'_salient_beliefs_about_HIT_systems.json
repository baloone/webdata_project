{"id":"263662773_Acceptance_and_use_of_electronic_medical_records_An_exploratory_study_of_hospital_physicians'_salient_beliefs_about_HIT_systems","abstract":"If a hospital keeps electronic medical records (EMRs), the underlying health\ninformation system is the primary repository and source of patient-related data\nfor hospital physicians. Even though the benefits and improvements attained\nthrough health information technology (HIT) are widely acknowledged, EMR\nadoption rates are surprisingly low in German hospitals. Since there is no ‘pull’ to\nuse EMR systems, we theorize that low penetration of EMR systems could be in\npart explained by physicians’ antipathy towards computerized medical records.\nIn order to examine physicians’ salient beliefs about EMRs and EMR usage and to\nidentify the processes that form them, we conducted a multi-case study in\nGerman hospitals, drawing on concepts from Social Cognitive Theory and the\nUnified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) to elicit beliefs\nand structure our analysis. This study sheds light on different types of beliefs and\nthe belief-forming process and their impact on HIT acceptance and use. Our\nfindings indicate that HIT acceptance and use is not solely impacted by cognitive\nbehavioural and environmental factors, as proposed by UTAUT, but also by\npersonal factors such as self-efficacy and emotions. Furthermore, our study\nprovides evidence of continuous reciprocal causation across behavioural, personal\nand environmental beliefs. The findings indicate that existing technology\nacceptance models need to be modified for the specific health-care context by\nadapting the range, meaning and scope of constructs.","authors":["Andy
