{"id":"342427943_Preferences-based_approach_for_TRIZ_contradiction_matrix_exploitation_in_preliminary_design","abstract":"The TRIZ theory has demonstrated its effectiveness in solving creative problems in the product design field. However, its exploitation and the application of its various tools and techniques remain difficult for the nonexperts. Generally, the theory does not offer the necessary tools in the preprocessing phases, to support problem modeling. In this context the aim of many research studies is to make easier the TRIZ tools exploitation. The work developed in this paper deals with the TRIZ contradiction matrix exploitation difficulty, and focuses on technical contradictions established for a complex system prioritizing. The technical contradictions prioritizing will be achieved through induced effects impact evaluation on the different specified design objectives. The proposed approach allows analyzing and structuring the design problem in order to exploit the TRIZ contradiction matrix for the design problem resolving. The proposed approach responds to the main problems raised during TRIZ matrix exploitation, especially problems related to the abstraction process i.e. the standard contradiction formulation and their hierarchy. This aim is achieved through the decision-maker preferences (DMP) integration. An illustration of the proposed approach is carried out with a case study on the wind system.","authors":["Khadija Hmina","Mehdi El Amine","Lasri Larbi","Mohammed Sallaou"],"meta":["January 2020FME Transactions 48(3):588-599","DOI:10.5937/fme2003588H"],"references":["334715108_Knowledge_Management_for_Problem_Solving_Using_Semistructured_Contradiction_Matrix_Based_on_Physical_Quantity_Description","333595208_TRIZ_The_theory_of_Inventif_Problem_Solving_State_of_the_art","322800764_A_preliminary_design_innovation_aid_methodology_based_on_energy_analysis_and_TRIZ_tools_exploitation","271993776_A_framework_of_product_innovative_design_process_based_on_TRIZ_and_Patent_Circumvention","336103748_The_Concept_of_Contradiction_Finding_and_Classification_in_the_Field_of_Marketing_Communication_Quality_Management","331532837_Case_studies_for_the_application_of_least_common_multiple_LCM_algorithm_for_resolving_multi-parameter_contradiction_by_inversion_of_TRIZ_contradiction_matrix","306276761_The_desirability_function","283540604_Adaptation_of_TRIZ_Contradiction_Matrix_for_Solving_Problems_in_Process_Engineering","273554487_Harmonization_of_new_wind_turbine_rotor_blades_development_process_A_review","271663249_An_integration_of_TRIZ_and_the_systematic_approach_of_Pahl_and_Beitz_for_innovative_conceptual_design_process"]}
