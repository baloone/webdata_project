{"id":"292368103_Applicants'_reactions_to_the_fairness_of_selection_procedures_The_effects_of_positive_rule_violations_and_time_of_measurement","abstract":"This study examined several unexplored issues in research on applicants' perceptions of fairness. First, the study explored possible differences between procedural violations that advantage individuals vs. those that are disadvantageous. Second, the study examined the complex relationship between process and outcome fairness across the stages of the selection process. A longitudinal, simulated selection process was used; procedural justice was manipulated by varying the consistency of test administration, and distributive justice was manipulated by varying perceptions of equity. Results indicate that favorable rule violations are perceived similar to rule satisfaction and that a complex and dynamic relationship exists between process and outcome fairness.","authors":["Robert E.
