{"id":"8357205_Application_of_Data_Mining_Techniques_to_Healthcare_Data","abstract":"A high-level introduction to data mining as it relates to surveillance of healthcare data is presented. Data mining is compared with traditional statistics, some advantages of automated data systems are identified, and some data mining strategies and algorithms are described. A concrete example illustrates steps involved in the data mining process, and three successful data mining applications in the healthcare arena are described.","authors":["Mary K Obenshain"],"meta":["September 2004Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology 25(8):690-5","DOI:10.1086/502460","SourcePubMed"],"references":["264158617_Statistical_Control_Charts_Based_on_a_Geometric_Distribution","13679496_Statistical_Quality_Control_Methods_in_Infection_Control_and_Hospital_Epidemiology_Part_II_Chart_Use_Statistical_Properties_and_Research_Issues","12038806_Feeding_Back_Surveillance_Data_To_Prevent_Hospital-Acquired_Infections","11637899_Number-Between_g-Type_Statistical_Quality_Control_Charts_for_Monitoring_Adverse_Events","10730509_Dead_Bird_Clusters_as_an_Early_Warning_System_for_West_Nile_Virus_Activity","325097658_Statistical_Control_Charts_Based_on_a_Geometric_Distribution","305918111_Analysis_of_Hospital_Infection_Surveillance_Data","290799123_Total_quality_measurement_in_health_care_Using_individuals_charts_in_infection_control","274109787_Feeding_Back_Surveillance_Data_To_Prevent_Hospital-Acquired_Infections","251391318_Novel_Software_Tools_for_Chemical_Diversity","239555302_Using_Enterprise_Miner_to_Explore_and_Exploit_Drug_Discovery_Data","51341155_Statistical_Quality_Control_Methods_in_Infection_Control_and_Hospital_Epidemiology_Part_I_Introduction_and_Basic_Theory","16632392_Analysis_of_hospital_infection_surveillance_data","15066240_The_Use_of_Statistical_Process_Control_Charts_in_Hospital_Epidemiology","14589236_Application_of_Exponential_Smoothing_for_Nosocomial_Infection_Surveillance","12212823_Practical_risk-adjusted_quality_control_charts_for_infection_control","12138767_A_Data_Mining_System_for_Infection_Control_Surveillance"]}
