{"id":"305810992_Flush_Gauss_and_Reload_-_A_Cache_Attack_on_the_BLISS_Lattice-Based_Signature_Scheme","abstract":"We present the first side-channel attack on a lattice-based signature scheme, using the Flush+Reload cache-attack. The attack is targeted at the discrete Gaussian sampler, an important step in the Bimodal Lattice Signature Schemes (BLISS). After observing only 450 signatures with a perfect side-channel, an attacker is able to extract the secret BLISS-key in less than 2 minutes, with a success probability of 0.96. Similar results are achieved in a proof-of-concept implementation using the Flush+Reload technique with less than 3500 signatures.\nWe show how to attack sampling from a discrete Gaussian using CDT or Bernoulli sampling by showing potential information leakage via cache memory. For both sampling methods, a strategy is given to use this additional information, finalize the attack and extract the secret key. We provide experimental evidence for the idealized perfect side-channel attacks and the Flush+Reload attack on two recent CPUs.","authors":["Leon Groot Bruinderink","Andreas HÃ¼lsing","Tanja Lange","Yuval Yarom"],"meta":["August 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-3-662-53140-2_16","Conference: International Conference on Cryptographic Hardware and Embedded Systems"],"references":["297191692_Post-quantum_key_exchange_-_a_new_hope","289952669_Cross-Tenant_Side-Channel_Attacks_in_PaaS_Clouds","274654361_Post-Quantum_Key_Exchange_for_the_TLS_Protocol_from_the_Ring_Learning_with_Errors_Problem","268164225_Sampling_from_discrete_Gaussians_for_lattice-based_cryptography_on_a_constrained_device","265809389_Lattice_Signatures_and_Bimodal_Gaussians","265793320_Enhanced_Lattice-Based_Signatures_on_Reconfigurable_Hardware","262293992_Practical_Lattice-Based_Cryptography_A_Signature_Scheme_for_Embedded_Systems","224248629_Cache_Games_--_Bringing_Access-Based_Cache_Attacks_on_AES_to_Practice","50863306_Factoring_Polynomials_with_Rational_Coefficients","312829813_Authenticated_Key_Exchange_from_Ideal_Lattices","312147834_NIST_Report_on_Post-Quantum_Cryptography","304179808_Non-uniform_Random_Variate_Generations","300009768_Lattice_Cryptography_for_the_Internet","294281600_High_Precision_Discrete_Gaussian_Sampling_on_FPGAs","291406447_Wait_a_Minute_A_fast_Cross-VM_Attack_on_AES","290110019_Discrete_Ziggurat_A_Time-Memory_Trade-Off_for_Sampling_from_a_Gaussian_Distribution_over_the_Integers","283795526_Just_a_Little_Bit_More","283594207_Last-Level_Cache_Side-Channel_Attacks_are_Practical","281315450_Cache_Template_Attacks_Automating_Attacks_on_Inclusive_Last-Level_Caches","279868737_FLUSHRELOAD_A_High_Resolution_Low_Noise_L3_Cache_Side-Channel_Attack","265793265_Towards_Practical_Lattice-Based_Public-Key_Encryption_on_Reconfigurable_Hardware","242622843_NTL_A_library_for_doing_number_theory","238733534_On_Generating_Random_Variates_from_an_Empirical_Distribution","228939782_Cache-timing_attacks_on_AES","228874485_Cache_Attacks_and_Countermeasures_The_Case_of_AES","228377724_Cache_missing_for_fun_and_profit","221591873_Trapdoors_for_hard_lattices_and_new_cryptographic_constructions","221354944_An_Efficient_and_Parallel_Gaussian_Sampler_for_Lattices","221208379_Better_Key_Sizes_and_Attacks_for_LWE-Based_Encryption","220335542_Better_Key_Sizes_and_Attacks_for_LWE-Based_Encryption","2319740_NTRU_A_ring-based_public_key_cryptosystem"]}
