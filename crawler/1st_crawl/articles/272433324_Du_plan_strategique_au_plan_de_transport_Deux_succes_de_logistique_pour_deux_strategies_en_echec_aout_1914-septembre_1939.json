Means are mostly human material, essentially supported by the 75 mm cannon. Space devoted to military operations depends on diplomatic considerations: where should an offensive action be directed, toward the eastern border, in Alsace-Lorraine, or toward the North? The decision has an impact on the time limit necessary for the troop’s transportation and the capacity of railway networks to comply with it. The third factor, time, is regulated by the ability of railway to concentrate at the border more than 800.000 men in a deadline at most equal to 14 days as soon as the mobilisation proclaimed. Given that the average speed of the trains of an Army Corp is 30 km/h, is the French railway network up to the problem? For that one has to innovate in the domain of rolling stock, depots, fixe facilities, exploitation. Overall, infrastructures had to be improved, departure platforms created, tunnel template enlarged, alternative routes set up. Thanks to these well-advised decisions, the concentration is a success. From August the 15th, the goal is achieved. In 1939, the railway takes inspiration of the same principles as in 1914, takes advantage of the acquired experience and of modernisation effects. Its more complex part is quite well carried out as acknowledged by civilian and military authorities. Unfortunately, in spite of an undisputable success, the young SNCF falls prey to a new dimension of the war, air supremacy.","authors":["Pierre Lepage"],"meta":["September 2012Revue D’histoire des Chemins de Fer","DOI:10.4000/rhcf.1544"],"references":["250741392_La_signalisation_ferroviaire_francaise_d'hier_a_aujourd'hui"]}
