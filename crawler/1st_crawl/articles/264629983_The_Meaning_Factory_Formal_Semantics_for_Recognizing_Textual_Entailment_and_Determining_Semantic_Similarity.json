{"id":"264629983_The_Meaning_Factory_Formal_Semantics_for_Recognizing_Textual_Entailment_and_Determining_Semantic_Similarity","abstract":"Shared Task 1 of SemEval-2014 comprised two subtasks on the same dataset of sentence pairs: recognizing textual entailment and determining textual similarity. We used an existing system based on formal semantics and logical inference to participate in the first subtask, reaching an accuracy of 82%, ranking in the top 5 of more than twenty participating systems. For determining semantic similarity we took a supervised approach using a variety of features, the majority of which was produced by our system for recognizing textual entailment. In this subtask our system achieved a mean squared error of 0.322, the best of all participating systems.","authors":["Johannes Bjerva","Johan Bos","Rob van der Goot","Malvina Nissim"],"meta":["August 2014","DOI:10.13140/2.1.3338.5609","Conference: SemEval-2014 WorkshopAt: Dublin, Ireland"],"references":["264003485_SemEval-2014_Task_1_Evaluation_of_Compositional_Distributional_Semantic_Models_on_Full_Sentences_through_Semantic_Relatedness_and_Textual_Entailment","257882504_Distributed_Representations_of_Words_and_Phrases_and_their_Compositionality","254502455_Wide-Coverage_Semantic_Analysis_with_Boxer","319770439_Efficient_Estimation_of_Word_Representations_in_Vector_Space","288906520_Random_forests","262891670_Automatic_proofs_and_counterexamples_for_some_ortholattice_identities","243601723_New_Techniques_that_Improve_MACE-style_Finite_Model_Finding","242367562_From_Discourse_to_Logic_Introduction_to_Modeltheoretic_Semantics_of_Natural_Language_Formal_Logic_and_Discourse_Representation_Theory","241185806_PPDB_The_Paraphrase_Database","238606254_The_Syntactic_Process"]}
