{"id":"224627237_Convergence_in_Multiagent_Coordination_Consensus_and_Flocking","abstract":"We discuss an old distributed algorithm for reaching consensus that has received a fair amount of recent attention. In this algorithm, a number of agents exchange their values asynchronously and form weighted averages with (possibly outdated) values possessed by their neighbors. We overview existing convergence results, and establish some new ones, for the case of unbounded intercommunication intervals.","authors":["Vincent D. Blondel","J.M.
