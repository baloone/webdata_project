{"id":"266396750_Tensor_products_and_regularity_properties_of_Cuntz_semigroups","abstract":"The Cuntz semigroup of a C*-algebra is an important invariant in the\nstructure and classification theory of C*-algebras. It captures more\ninformation than K-theory but is often more delicate to handle. We\nsystematically study the lattice and category theoretic aspects of Cuntz\nsemigroups.\nGiven a C*-algebra $A$, its (concrete) Cuntz semigroup $Cu(A)$ is an object\nin the category $Cu$ of (abstract) Cuntz semigroups, as introduced by Coward,\nElliott and Ivanescu. To clarify the distinction between concrete and abstract\nCuntz semigroups, we will call the latter $Cu$-semigroups.\nWe establish the existence of tensor products in the category $Cu$ and study\nthe basic properties of this construction. We show that $Cu$ is a symmetric,\nmonoidal category and relate $Cu(A\\otimes B)$ with $Cu(A)\\otimes_{Cu}Cu(B)$ for\ncertain classes of C*-algebras.\nAs a main tool for our approach we introduce the category $W$ of\npre-completed Cuntz semigroups. We show that $Cu$ is a full, reflective\nsubcategory of $W$. One can then easily deduce properties of $Cu$ from\nrespective properties of $W$, e.g. the existence of tensor products and\ninductive limits. The advantage is that constructions in $W$ are much easier\nsince the objects are purely algebraic.\nWe also develop a theory of $Cu$-semirings and their semimodules. The Cuntz\nsemigroup of a strongly self-absorbing C*-algebra has a natural product giving\nit the structure of a $Cu$-semiring. We give explicit characterizations of\n$Cu$-semimodules over such $Cu$-semirings. For instance, we show that a\n$Cu$-semigroup $S$ tensorially absorbs the $Cu$-semiring of the Jiang-Su\nalgebra if and only if $S$ is almost unperforated and almost divisible, thus\nestablishing a semigroup version of the Toms-Winter conjecture.","authors":["Ramon Antoine","Francesc Perera","Hannes Thiel"],"meta":["October 2014Memoirs of the American Mathematical Society 251(1199)","DOI:10.1090/memo/1199","SourcearXiv"],"references":["267985400_Completely_positive_maps_of_order_zero","266516109_Classification_of_C_-homomorphisms_from_C_0_01_to_a_C_-algebra","265366135_The_round_ideal_completion_via_sobrification","265354140_Categories_for_the_working_mathematician_2nd_ed","256269791_Convenient_categories_of_topological_algebras_and_their_duality_theory","251283111_Obstructions_to_Z-Stability_for_Unital_Simple_C_-Algebras","245931129_Dimension_Groups_and_Their_Affine_Representations","238882058_Embedding_of_exact_C-algebras_in_the_Cuntz_algebra_O2","238859790_Dimension_functions_and_traces_on_C-algebras","236696344_On_a_Simple_Unital_Projectionless_C-Algebra"]}
