{"id":"221538366_Evaluating_programming_ability_in_an_introductory_computer_science_course","abstract":"There are numerous ways to evaluate student programming ability, all of which have benefits and drawbacks. In this paper we discuss how we have combined a number of those evaluation techniques to assess student programming ability in an introductory computer science course and statistically analyze the relationships of student performance using the different evaluation techniques.","authors":["A.
