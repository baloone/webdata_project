{"id":"324558524_Closing_the_Loop_for_Robotic_Grasping_A_Real-time_Generative_Grasp_Synthesis_Approach","abstract":"This paper presents a real-time, object-independent grasp synthesis method which can be used for closed-loop grasping. Our proposed Generative Grasping Convolutional Neural Network (GG-CNN) predicts the quality of grasps at every pixel. This one-to-one mapping from a depth image overcomes limitations of current deep learning grasping techniques, specifically by avoiding discrete sampling of grasp candidates and long computation times. Additionally, our GG-CNN is orders of magnitude smaller while detecting stable grasps with equivalent performance to current state-of-the-art techniques. The lightweight and single-pass generative nature of our GG-CNN allows for closed-loop control at up to 50Hz, enabling accurate grasping in non-static environments where objects move and in the presence of robot control inaccuracies. In our real-world tests, we achieve an 83% grasp success rate on a set of previously unseen objects with adversarial geometry and 88% on a set of household objects that are moved during the grasp attempt. We also achieve 81% accuracy when grasping in dynamic clutter.","authors":["Douglas Morrison","Peter Ian Corke","Juxi Leitner"],"meta":["April 2018","Project: Robust Robotic Manipulation"],"references":["322749812_SegNet_A_Deep_Convolutional_Encoder-Decoder_Architecture_for_Image_Segmentation","321816103_On_the_relevance_of_grasp_metrics_for_predicting_grasp_success","319770233_Deep_Learning_for_Detecting_Robotic_Grasps","318695714_The_ACRV_picking_benchmark_A_robotic_shelf_picking_benchmark_to_foster_reproducible_research","315682763_Dex-Net_20_Deep_Learning_to_Plan_Robust_Grasps_with_Synthetic_Point_Clouds_and_Analytic_Grasp_Metrics","319770328_Supersizing_Self-supervision_Learning_to_Grasp_from_50K_Tries_and_700_Robot_Hours","315472598_Learning_Hand-Eye_Coordination_for_Robotic_Grasping_with_Large-Scale_Data_Collection","313397400_Designing_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_Continuous_Object_Orientation_Estimation","311756087_Deep_learning_a_grasp_function_for_grasping_under_gripper_pose_uncertainty","311609660_Object_Contour_Detection_with_a_Fully_Convolutional_Encoder-Decoder_Network"]}
