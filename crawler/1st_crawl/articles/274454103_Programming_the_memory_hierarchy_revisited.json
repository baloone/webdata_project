{"id":"274454103_Programming_the_memory_hierarchy_revisited","abstract":"We describe two novel constructs for programming parallel machines with multi-level memory hierarchies: call-up, which allows a child task to invoke computation on its parent, and spawn, which spawns a dynamically determined number of parallel children until some termination condition in the parent is met. Together we show that these constructs allow applications with irregular parallelism to be programmed in a straightforward manner, and furthermore these constructs complement and can be combined with constructs for expressing regular parallelism. We have implemented spawn and call-up in Sequoia and we present an experimental evaluation on a number of irregular applications.","authors":["Michael Bauer","John Clark","Eric Schkufza","Alex Aiken"],"meta":["September 2011ACM SIGPLAN Notices 46(8):13","DOI:10.1145/2038037.1941558"],"references":["235195247_External_Memory_Algorithms_Dealing_With_Massive_Data","228734882_Introduction_to_UPC_and_language_specification","227108047_The_uniform_memory_hierarchy_model_of_computation","221643792_A_Portable_Runtime_Interface_For_Multi-Level_Memory_Hierarchies","221643791_Compilation_for_explicitly_managed_memory_hierarchies","221643683_Programming_for_parallelism_and_locality_with_hierarchically_tiled_arrays","221496743_Hierarchical_Place_Trees_A_Portable_Abstraction_for_Task_Parallelism_and_Data_Movement","221257316_Parallel_sparse_matrix-vector_and_matrix-transpose-vector_multiplication_using_compressed_sparse_blocks","221235507_Adaptive_runtime_tuning_of_parallel_sparse_matrix-vector_multiplication_on_distributed_memory_systems","220884583_A_tuning_framework_for_software-managed_memory_hierarchies","220782744_Entering_the_Petaflop_Era_The_Architecture_and_Performance_of_Roadrunner","220492625_The_University_of_Florida_Sparse_Matrix_Collection","220163323_ManySAT_a_parallel_SAT_solver","213880752_Sequoia_Programming_the_Memory_Hierarchy","211746246_OSKI_A_library_of_automatically_tuned_sparse_matrix_kernels","3628957_Space-limited_procedures_a_methodology_for_portablehigh-performance","284411763_An_extensible_SAT-solver","279352624_X10","271452225_IO_complexity","265308525_Brook_for_GPUs","247883709_The_Fortress_Language_10_Specification","246984932_Co-Array_Fortran_for_parallel_programming","243534110_A_programming_system_for_the_imagine_media_processor","238714491_Ullman_compilers_m_principles_techniques_and_tools","220105573_Titanium_A_High-performance_Java_Dialect","213884599_The_Fortress_Language_Specification","201976724_MPI_The_complete_reference","45875598_GPU_sample_sort","4074568_Abstractions_for_dynamic_data_distribution","4074557_The_Cascade_High_Productivity_Language","3557920_Modeling_parallel_computers_as_memory_hierarchies","3344403_OpenMP_An_Industry-Standard_API_for_Shared-Memory_Programming","2248787_Cilk_An_Efficient_Multithreaded_Runtime_System"]}
