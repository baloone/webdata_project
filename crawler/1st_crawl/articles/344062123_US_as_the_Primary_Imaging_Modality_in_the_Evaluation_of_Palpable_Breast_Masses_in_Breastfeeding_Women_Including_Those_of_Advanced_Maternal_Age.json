Current guidelines recommend US as the first-line imaging modality for palpable masses in pregnant and lactating women, but data regarding breastfeeding women age 30 years and older are near nonexistent. Purpose To evaluate the diagnostic performance of targeted US as the primary imaging modality for the evaluation of palpable masses in lactating women, including those of advanced maternal age. Materials and Methods Lactating women with palpable breast masses evaluated at targeted US over a 17-year period (January 2000 to July 2017) were retrospectively identified. All US evaluations were performed at diagnostic evaluation, and mammography was performed at the discretion of the interpreting radiologist. Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System assessments, imaging, and pathology results were collected. Descriptive statistics and 2 × 2 contingency tables were assessed at the patient level. Results There were 167 women (mean age, 35 years ± 5 [standard deviation]), 101 of whom (60%) were of advanced maternal age (≥35 years). All women underwent targeted US, and 98 (59%) underwent mammography in addition to US. The frequency of malignancy was five of 167 (3.0%). Targeted US demonstrated a sensitivity and specificity of five of five (100%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 48%, 100%) and 114 of 162 (70%; 95% CI: 63%, 77%), respectively. Negative predictive value, positive predictive value of an abnormal examination, and positive predictive value of biopsy were 114 of 114 (100%; 95% CI: 97%, 100%), five of 53 (9.4%; 95% CI: 3%, 21%), and five of 50 (10%; 95% CI: 3%, 22%), respectively. In the subset of 98 women who underwent mammography in addition to US, mammography depicted seven incidental suspicious findings, which lowered the specificity from 62 of 93 (67%; 95% CI: 56%, 76%) to 57 of 93 (61%; 95% CI: 51%, 71%) (P = .02). Conclusion Targeted US depicted all malignancies in lactating women with palpable masses. Adding mammography increased false-positive findings without any additional cancer diagnoses. © RSNA, 2020 See also the editorial by Newell in this issue.","authors":["Maggie Chung","Jessica H.
