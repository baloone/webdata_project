{"id":"331507272_Solar_farside_magnetograms_from_deep_learning_analysis_of_STEREOEUVI_data","abstract":"Solar magnetograms are important for studying solar activity and predicting space weather disturbances1. Farside magnetograms can be constructed from local helioseismology without any farside data2-4, but their quality is lower than that of typical frontside magnetograms. Here we generate farside solar magnetograms from STEREO/Extreme UltraViolet Imager (EUVI) 304-Å images using a deep learning model based on conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs). We train the model using pairs of Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) 304-Å images and SDO/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) magnetograms taken from 2011 to 2017 except for September and October each year. We evaluate the model by comparing pairs of SDO/HMI magnetograms and cGAN-generated magnetograms in September and October. Our method successfully generates frontside solar magnetograms from SDO/AIA 304-Å images and these are similar to those of the SDO/HMI, with Hale-patterned active regions being well replicated. Thus we can monitor the temporal evolution of magnetic fields from the farside to the frontside of the Sun using SDO/HMI and farside magnetograms generated by our model when farside extreme-ultraviolet data are available. This study presents an application of image-to-image translation based on cGANs to scientific data. Farside solar magnetograms are generated from STEREO images using deep learning, with Hale-patterned active regions being well reproduced. These images can be used to monitor the temporal evolution of magnetic fields from the farside to the frontside.","authors":["Taeyoung Kim","Eunsu Park","Harim Lee","Yong-Jae Moon"],"meta":["May 2019Nature Astronomy 3(5):1","DOI:10.1038/s41550-019-0711-5"],"references":["313832991_Seismic_Imaging_of_the_Sun's_Far_Hemisphere_and_its_Applications_in_Space-Weather_Forecasting_Seismic_Imaging_of_the_Sun's_Far_Side","310610633_Image-to-Image_Translation_with_Conditional_Adversarial_Networks","288596827_The_Solar_Dynamics_Observatory_SDO","257664311_Design_and_Ground_Calibration_of_the_Helioseismic_and_Magnetic_Imager_HMI_Instrument_on_the_Solar_Dynamics_Observatory_SDO","236203246_Soft_X-ray_fluxes_of_major_flares_far_behind_the_limb_as_estimated_using_STEREO_EUV_images","236026766_The_Solar_Dynamics_Observatory","319770355_Generative_Adversarial_Nets","258258553_CHIANTI-An_atomic_database_for_emission_lines_XII_Version_7_of_the_database","257664847_Comparison_of_Line-of-Sight_Magnetograms_Taken_by_the_Solar_Dynamics_ObservatoryHelioseismic_and_Magnetic_Imager_and_Solar_and_Heliospheric_ObservatoryMichelson_Doppler_Imager","234360459_CHIANTI_-_an_atomic_database_for_emission_lines","228930761_Seismic_Imaging_of_the_Far_Hemisphere_of_the_Sun","225194195_The_Atmospheric_Imaging_Assembly_AIA_on_the_Solar_Dynamics_Observatory_SDO","226970122_The_STEREO_mission_an_introduction","45933110_The_solar_magnetic_field","44208365_CHIANTI_-_an_atomic_database_for_emission_lines"]}
