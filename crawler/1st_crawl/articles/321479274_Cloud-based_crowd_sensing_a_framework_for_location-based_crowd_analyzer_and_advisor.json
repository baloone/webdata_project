{"id":"321479274_Cloud-based_crowd_sensing_a_framework_for_location-based_crowd_analyzer_and_advisor","abstract":"Cloud computing is an emerging field of computer science to integrate and explore large and powerful computing systems and storages for personal and also for enterprise requirements. Mobile Cloud Computing is the inheritance of this concept towards mobile hand-held devices. Crowdsensing, or to be precise, Mobile Crowdsensing is the process of sharing resources from an available group of mobile handheld devices that support sharing of different resources such as data, memory and bandwidth to perform a single task for collective reasons. In this paper, we propose a framework to use Crowdsensing and perform a crowd analyzer and advisor whether the user can go to the place or not. This is an ongoing research and is a new concept to which the direction of cloud computing has shifted and is viable for more expansion in the near future.","authors":["C.
