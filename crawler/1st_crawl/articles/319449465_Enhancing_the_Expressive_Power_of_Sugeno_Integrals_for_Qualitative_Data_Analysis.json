{"id":"319449465_Enhancing_the_Expressive_Power_of_Sugeno_Integrals_for_Qualitative_Data_Analysis","abstract":"Sugeno integrals are useful for describing families of multiple criteria aggregation functions qualitatively. It is known that Sugeno integrals, as aggregation functions, can be represented by a set of rules. Each rule refers to the same threshold in the conditions about the values of the criteria and in the conclusion pertaining to the value of the integral. However, in the general case we expect rules where several thresholds appear. Some of these rules involving different thresholds can be represented by Sugeno utility functionals where criteria values are rescaled by means of utility functions associated with each criterion. But as shown in this paper, their representation power is quite restrictive. In contrast, we provide evidence to conjecture that the use of disjunctions or conjunctions of Sugeno integrals with utility functions drastically improves the expressive power and that they can capture any aggregation function on a finite scale, understood as piecewise unary aggregation functions.","authors":["Miguel Couceiro","Didier Dubois","Henri Prade","Rico Agnes"],"meta":["September 2018Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-66830-7_48","Conference: International Workshop on Intuitionistic Fuzzy Sets and Generalized Nets Proceedings of the Conference of the European Society for Fuzzy Logic and Technology"],"references":["281128505_Decision-Making_with_Sugeno_Integrals_Bridging_the_Gap_Between_Multicriteria_Evaluation_and_Decision_Under_Uncertainty","220354421_The_Use_of_the_Discrete_Sugeno_Integral_in_Decision-Making_A_Survey","23420664_Axiomatizations_of_quasi-polynomial_functions_on_bounded_chains","280595805_Extracting_Decision_Rules_from_Qualitative_Data_Using_Sugeno_Integral_A_Case-Study","268315697_Qualitative_Possibility_Functions_and_Integrals","260026742_The_logical_encoding_of_Sugeno_integrals","239667554_Aggregation_operators_for_multicriteria_decision_aid","239662875_Fuzzy_measures_and_fuzzy_integrals_A_survey","222529298_On_Sugeno_integral_as_an_aggregation_function","47685570_Elicitating_Sugeno_Integrals_Methodology_and_a_Case_Study","34085988_Theory_of_Fuzzy_Integrals_and_its_Applications","23530168_Preference_modeling_on_totally_ordered_sets_by_the_Sugeno_integral","4871737_Axiomatic_characterization_of_a_general_utility_function_and_its_particular_cases_in_terms_of_conjoint_measurement_and_rough-set_decision_rules","4869132_Decision-theoretic_foundations_of_possibility_theory_Eur_J_Oper_Res"]}
