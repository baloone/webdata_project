{"id":"310750120_A_Sentiment_Classification_Model_Based_On_Multiple_Classifiers","abstract":"With the widespread usage of social networks, forums and blogs, customer reviews emerged as a critical factor for the customers’ purchase decisions. Since the beginning of 2000s, researchers started to focus on these reviews to automatically categorize them into polarity levels such as positive, negative, and neutral. This research problem is known as sentiment classification. The objective of this study is to investigate the potential benefit of multiple classifier systems concept on Turkish sentiment classification problem and propose a novel classification technique. Vote algorithm has been used in conjunction with three classifiers, namely Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Bagging. Parameters of the SVM have been optimized when it was used as an individual classifier. Experimental results showed that multiple classifier systems increase the performance of individual classifiers on Turkish sentiment classification datasets and meta classifiers contribute to the power of these multiple classifier systems. The proposed approach achieved better performance than Naive Bayes, which was reported the best individual classifier for these datasets, and Support Vector Machines. Multiple classifier systems (MCS) is a good approach for sentiment classification, and parameter optimization of individual classifiers must be taken into account while developing MCS-based prediction systems.","authors":["Cagatay Catal","Mehmet Nangır"],"meta":["November 2016Applied Soft Computing 50","DOI:10.1016/j.asoc.2016.11.022"],"references":["288002744_A_survey_on_opinion_mining_and_sentiment_analysis_Tasks_approaches_and_applications","267339077_Sentiment_Analysis_Bayesian_Ensemble_Learning","261875740_Sentiment_Analysis_Algorithms_and_Applications_A_Survey","261123105_Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis_A_Bootstrap_Ensemble_Framework","248832100_Thumbs_Up_or_Thumbs_Down_Semantic_Orientation_Applied_to_Unsupervised_Classification_of_Reviews","229020545_Movie_review_classification_based_on_a_multiple_classifier","224122306_Flexible_Manifold_Embedding_A_Framework_for_Semi-Supervised_and_Unsupervised_Dimension_Reduction","221618060_Efficient_and_Robust_Feature_Selection_via_Joint_l2_1-Norms_Minimization","221606750_Trace_Ratio_Criterion_for_Feature_Selection","221231773_Sentiment_Mining_Using_Ensemble_Classification_Models","215470666_Customizing_Sentiment_Classifiers_to_New_Domains_A_Case_Study","4284989_Sentiment_Classification_through_Combining_Classifiers_with_Multiple_Feature_Sets","3297961_Affect_Analysis_of_Web_Forums_and_Blogs_Using_Correlation_Ensembles","313715625_Ensemble_of_feature_sets_and_classification_algorithms_for_sentiment_classification","310752285_Emotion_analysis_on_Turkish_texts","310751775_When_specialists_and_generalists_work_together_Overcoming_domain_dependence_in_sentiment_tagging","281504372_Heterogeneous_ensemble_learning_for_Chinese_sentiment_classification","278744214_Opinion_Mining_and_Information_Fusion_A_Survey","278710482_Transfer_Learning_Using_Twitter_Data_for_Improving_Sentiment_Classification_of_Turkish_Political_News","278705930_Research_and_Development_in_Intelligent_Systems_XXIX","278659270_Computer_and_Information_Sciences_III","270727928_Stream-based_active_learning_for_sentiment_analysis_in_the_financial_domain","269762971_Sentiment_Analysis_and_Opinion_Mining","262406292_Ensemble_Learning_for_Sentiment_Classification","261763331_Unsupervised_product_feature_extraction_for_feature-oriented_opinion_determination","261211359_Active_learning_for_Turkish_sentiment_analysis","260212555_Sentiment_topic_models_for_social_emotion_mining","259993725_Sentiment_classification_The_contribution_of_ensemble_learning","257404380_Document-level_sentiment_classification_An_empirical_comparison_between_SVM_and_ANN","245536229_Ranked_WordNet_Graph_for_Sentiment_Polarity_Classification_in_Twitter","222406047_Sentiment_analysis_A_combined_approach","221544934_Combining_a_large_sentiment_lexicon_and_machine_learning_for_subjectivity_classification","221101673_Active_Deep_Networks_for_Semi-Supervised_Sentiment_Classification","220766181_Document-Word_Co-regularization_for_Semi-supervised_Sentiment_Analysis","220644345_Orthogonal_vs_uncorrelated_least_squares_discriminant_analysis_for_feature_extraction","220541603_Recognizing_Strong_and_Weak_Opinion_Clauses","220313882_Ensemble_of_feature_sets_and_classification_algorithms_for_sentiment_classification","220216023_Practical_development_of_an_Eclipse-based_software_fault_prediction_tool_using_Naive_Bayes_algorithm","2518534_Thumbs_up_Sentiment_Classification_Using_Machine_Learning_Techniques"]}
