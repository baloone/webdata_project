{"id":"348703844_Racism_Hate_Speech_and_Social_Media_A_Systematic_Review_and_Critique","abstract":"Departing from Jessie Daniels’s 2013 review of scholarship on race and racism online, this article maps and discusses recent developments in the study of racism and hate speech in the subfield of social media research. Systematically examining 104 articles, we address three research questions: Which geographical contexts, platforms, and methods do researchers engage with in studies of racism and hate speech on social media? To what extent does scholarship draw on critical race perspectives to interrogate how systemic racism is (re)produced on social media? What are the primary methodological and ethical challenges of the field? The article finds a lack of geographical and platform diversity, an absence of researchers’ reflexive dialogue with their object of study, and little engagement with critical race perspectives to unpack racism on social media. There is a need for more thorough interrogations of how user practices and platform politics co-shape contemporary racisms.","authors":["Ariadna Matamoros-Fernandez","Johan Farkas"],"meta":["February 2021Television & New Media 22(2):205-224","DOI:10.1177/1527476420982230"],"references":["342098845_They_Got_Filters_Indigenous_Social_Media_the_Settler_Gaze_and_a_Politics_of_Hope","332373168_Big_Data_from_the_Souths_Beyond_Data_Universalism","327059444_Visualizing_YouTube's_comment_space_online_hostility_as_a_networked_phenomena","345683243_The_SAGE_Handbook_of_Social_Media","339573076_Engaging_the_White_Possessive","334000468_Behind_the_Screen_Content_Moderation_in_the_Shadows_of_Social_Media","331763083_Racial_Formation_in_the_United_States","328882176_Introduction_Indigenous_innovation_in_social_media","327109256_Algorithms_of_Oppression_How_Search_Engines_Reinforce_Racism","326805548_Countering_Hate_Speech_on_Facebook_The_Case_of_the_Roma_Minority_in_Slovakia"]}
