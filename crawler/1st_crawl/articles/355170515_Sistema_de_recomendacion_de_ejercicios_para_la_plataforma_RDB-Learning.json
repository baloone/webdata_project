{"id":"355170515_Sistema_de_recomendacion_de_ejercicios_para_la_plataforma_RDB-Learning","abstract":"The University of Computer Science's premise is\nthe linking of learning technologies and knowledge in the\neducational teaching process. In its study plan, there is the\nsubject Database Systems I, where the RDB-Learning tool\nis used as a virtual platform to support the teachinglearning process. The developed tool facilitates exercise\noutside the classroom, however, when students are\nprepared to perform exercises self-taught, they are not\nalways able to select the ones that best suit their needs\naccording to the skills achieved in the subject. This\nresearch presents a system for the automatic\nrecommendation of exercises in the RDB-Learning\nplatform, which suggests to students which exercise to\ncarry out, based on prior knowledge of what skills the\nstudent has been able to develop in the subject given by\ntheir systematic evaluations. For this, an analysis of\nrelational data bases design and of the main existing\nrecommendation algorithms is carried out. In addition, an\nevaluation is made of how the tool contributes to the guided\nlearning of the students.","authors":["Carlos Yordan González","Yaniel Lázaro Aragón Barreda"],"meta":["June 2021"],"references":[]}
