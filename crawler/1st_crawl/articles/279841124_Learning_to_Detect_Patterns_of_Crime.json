{"id":"279841124_Learning_to_Detect_Patterns_of_Crime","abstract":"Our goal is to automatically detect patterns of crime. Among\na large set of crimes that happen every year in a major city, it is challenging,\ntime-consuming, and labor-intensive for crime analysts to determine\nwhich ones may have been committed by the same individual(s). If automated,\ndata-driven tools for crime pattern detection are made available\nto assist analysts, these tools could help police to better understand patterns\nof crime, leading to more precise attribution of past crimes, and\nthe apprehension of suspects. To do this, we propose a pattern detection\nalgorithm called Series Finder, that grows a pattern of discovered crimes\nfrom within a database, starting from a \\seed\" of a few crimes. Series\nFinder incorporates both the common characteristics of all patterns and\nthe unique aspects of each speci c pattern, and has had promising results\non a decade's worth of crime pattern data collected by the Crime\nAnalysis Unit of the Cambridge Police Department.","authors":["Tong Wang","Cynthia Rudin","Daniel Wagner","Rich Sevieri"],"meta":["August 2013","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-40994-3_33","Conference: Joint European Conference on Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases","Project: Crime Data Mining"],"references":["247478132_Near-Repeat_Patterns_in_Philadelphia_Shooting","242451455_A_Statistical_Model_of_Criminal_Behavior","232621180_Crime_Data_Mining_A_General_Framework_and_Some_Examples","227369342_Self-Exciting_Point_Process_Modeling_of_Crime","226919919_Measuring_and_Modeling_Repeat_and_Near-Repeat_Burglary_Effects","225734295_The_Elements_of_Statistical_Learning_Data_Mining_Inference_and_Prediction","224683327_Crime_Pattern_Detection_Using_Data_Mining","312617874_Incremental_mining_for_temporal_association_rules_for_crime_pattern_discoveries","257553466_Growing_a_list","228744603_Fuzzy_association_rule_mining_for_community_crime_pattern_discovery"]}
