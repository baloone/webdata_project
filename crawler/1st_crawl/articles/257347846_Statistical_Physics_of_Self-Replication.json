{"id":"257347846_Statistical_Physics_of_Self-Replication","abstract":"Self-replication is a capacity common to every species of living thing, and\nsimple physical intuition dictates that such a process must invariably be\nfueled by the production of entropy. Here, we undertake to make this intuition\nrigorous and quantitative by deriving a lower bound for the amount of heat that\nis produced during a process of self-replication in a system coupled to a\nthermal bath. We find that the minimum value for the physically allowed rate of\nheat production is determined by the growth rate, internal entropy, and\ndurability of the replicator, and we discuss the implications of this finding\nfor bacterial cell division, as well as for the pre-biotic emergence of\nself-replicating nucleic acids.","authors":["Jeremy L England"],"meta":["September 2013The Journal of Chemical Physics 139(12):121923","DOI:10.1063/1.4818538","SourcePubMed"],"references":["236578631_The_thermodynamics_of_template-directed_DNA_synthesis_Base_insertion_and_extension_enthalpies","225301998_Thermodynamic_Basis_for_the_Emergence_of_Genomes_during_Prebiotic_Evolution","224864451_Inequalities_Generalizing_the_Second_Law_of_Thermodynamics_for_Transitions_between_Nonstationary_States","242870147_Origin_of_life_the_RNA_world","231525176_Rates_of_Uncatalyzed_Peptide_Bond_Hydrolysis_in_Neutral_Solution_and_the_Transition_State_Affinities_of_Proteases","231217173_Triosephosphate_Isomerase_Catalysis_Is_Diffusion_Controlled","224105116_Irreversibility_and_Heat_Generation_in_the_Computing_Process","224043701_Handbook_of_Stochastic_Methods","51530951_Limits_to_Catalysis_by_Ribonuclease_A","49756372_What_is_a_Quasi-species"]}
