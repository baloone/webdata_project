{"id":"323856992_Data_Science_a_proposal_for_a_curriculum","abstract":"We define Data Science as the combination of statistical and computational data analytic approaches. We argue that only this combination allows to tackle the many problems occurring in todayâ€™s Big Data era. We outline a possible curriculum, which focuses on both statistics and computer science aspects of data analytics. The proposed curriculum is implemented in the Data Science master program run at the University Munich (www.datascience-munich.de). We also argue that data ethical aspects as well as practical and communication skills are essential in a modern Data Science study program.","authors":["Goeran Kauermann","Thomas Seidl"],"meta":["November 2018International Journal of Data Science and Analytics 6(4)","DOI:10.1007/s41060-018-0113-2"],"references":["321927669_50_Years_of_Data_Science","303197102_Introductory_Econometrics_A_Modern_Approach","265782588_Nonlinear_Measurement_Error_Models_A_Modern_Perspective","2367122_Data_Science_An_Action_Plan_for_Expanding_the_Technical_Areas_of_the_Field_of_Statistics"]}
