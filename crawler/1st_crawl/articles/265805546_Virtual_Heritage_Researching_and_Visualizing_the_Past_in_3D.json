{"id":"265805546_Virtual_Heritage_Researching_and_Visualizing_the_Past_in_3D","abstract":"The approaches and technologies of virtual heritage provide archaeologists, researchers, and students with the ability to \"see\" and understand the past interactively and in 3D , just as the past happened. The results of various projects underscore the new insights into the past that inevitably result from virtual reality re-creations of ancient sites, buildings, and artifacts. Interactive 3D virtual worlds offer many advantages over traditional 2D -based media. By collecting, integrating, and visualizing field data digitally, in 3D , and in a single software toolkit, excavations can participate in the coming paradigm shift in archaeology. This change in how the discipline works is exemplified by REVEAL, a new software system that is already having an impact on dozens of excavations around the world.","authors":["Donald H Sanders"],"meta":["January 2014Journal of Eastern Mediterranean Archaeology & Heritage Studies 2(1):30-47"],"references":["266675605_The_Tel_Akko_Total_Archaeology_Project_Akko_Israel_Assessing_the_Suitability_of_Multi-Scale_3D_Field_Recording_in_Archaeology","265118289_Virtual_Worlds_for_Archaeological_Research_and_Education","296807099_More_than_pretty_pictures_of_the_past_An_American_perspective_on_virtual_heritage","289041210_Virtual_Reconstruction_of_Maritime_Sites_and_Artifacts","276003366_The_Oxford_History_of_Classical_Art","271813618_The_Ancient_Temple_on_the_Acropolis_at_Athens","271482708_REVEAL_One_future_for_heritage_documentation","269982687_Virtual_Archaeology_Re-Creating_Ancient_Worlds","269443153_The_Oxford_History_of_the_Classical_World","3927469_Persuade_or_perish_moving_virtual_heritage_beyond_pretty_picturesof_the_past"]}
