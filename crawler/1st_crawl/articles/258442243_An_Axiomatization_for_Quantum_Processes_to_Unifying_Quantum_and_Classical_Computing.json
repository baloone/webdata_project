{"id":"258442243_An_Axiomatization_for_Quantum_Processes_to_Unifying_Quantum_and_Classical_Computing","abstract":"We establish an axiomatization for quantum processes, which is a quantum\ngeneralization of process algebra ACP (Algebra of Communicating Processes). We\nuse the framework of a quantum process configuration $\\langle p,\n\\varrho\\rangle$, but we treat it as two relative independent part: the\nstructural part $p$ and the quantum part $\\varrho$, because the establishment\nof a sound and complete theory is dependent on the structural properties of the\nstructural part $p$. We let the quantum part $\\varrho$ be the outcomes of\nexecution of $p$ to examine and observe the function of the basic theory of\nquantum mechanics. We establish not only a strong bisimularity for quantum\nprocesses, but also a weak bisimularity to model the silent step and abstract\ninternal computations in quantum processes. The relationship between quantum\nbisimularity and classical bisimularity is established, which makes an\naxiomatization of quantum processes possible. An axiomatization for quantum\nprocesses called qACP is designed, which involves not only quantum information,\nbut also classical information and unifies quantum computing and classical\ncomputing. qACP can be used easily and widely for verification of most quantum\ncommunication protocols.","authors":["Yong Wang"],"meta":["October 2019International Journal of Theoretical Physics 58(2â€“3)","DOI:10.1007/s10773-019-04204-6","SourcearXiv"],"references":["228109483_WITHDRAWN_Quantum_cryptography_Public_key_distribution_and_coin_tossing","290986771_Computational_problems_in_abstract_algebra","270956456_A_Calculus_of_Mobile_Processes_Parts_I_and_II","243517601_Communicating_sequential_processes_prentice-hall_international","234803172_Communication_and_Concurrency","224001269_Communication_and_Concurrency","224001226_Symbolic_Bisimulations","224001212_Communicating_Sequential_Processes","222565902_Probabilistic_bisimulations_for_quantum_processes","222450855_On_the_Consistency_of_Koomen's_Fair_Abstraction_Rule","221664548_Symbolic_Bisimulation_for_Quantum_Processes","220691349_Introduction_to_Process_Algebra","220431839_A_Theory_of_Communicating_Sequential_Processes","221598090_From_Quantum_Physics_to_Programming_Languages_A_Process_Algebraic_Approach","220695904_Communicating_Sequential_Processes"]}
