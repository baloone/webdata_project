{"id":"326572089_Aggregated_Resource_Provisioning_for_Network_Slices","abstract":"Network slicing has recently appeared as a key\nenabler for the future 5G networks where Mobile Network\nOperators (MNO) create various slices for Service Providers\n(SP) to accommodate customized services. As network slices are\noperated on a common network infrastructure owned by some\nInfrastructure Provider (InP), sharing the resources across a\nset of network slices is highly important for future deployment.\nIn this paper, taking the InP perspective, we propose an opti-\nmization framework for slice resource provisioning addressing\nmultiple slice demands in terms of computing, storage, and\nwireless capacity. We assume that the aggregated resource\nrequirements of the various Service Function Chains to be\ndeployed within a slice may be represented by a graph of slice\nresource demands. Infrastructure nodes and links have then\nto be provisioned so as to satisfy these resource demands. A\nMixed Integer Linear Programming formulation is considered\nto address this problem. A realistic use case of slices deployment\nover a mobile access network is then considered. Simulation\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework\nfor network slice provisioning.","authors":["Quang-Trung Luu","Michel Kieffer","Alexandre Mouradian","Sylvaine Kerboeuf"],"meta":["December 2018","DOI:10.1109/GLOCOM.2018.8648039","Conference: IEEE Global Communications Conference (Globecom) 2018At: Abu Dhabi"],"references":["320582718_Impact_of_Processing-Resource_Sharing_on_the_Placement_of_Chained_Virtual_Network_Functions","318798527_QoS-driven_function_placement_reducing_expenditures_in_NFV_deployments","313894708_Semantically_Enhanced_Mapping_Algorithm_for_Affinity_Constrained_Service_Function_Chain_Requests","303903309_TeNOR_Steps_towards_an_orchestration_platform_for_multi-PoP_NFV_deployment","295909278_Scheduling_Wireless_Virtual_Networks_Functions","264975746_Wireless_Network_Virtualization_A_Survey_Some_Research_Issues_and_Challenges","224247239_ViNEYard_Virtual_Network_Embedding_Algorithms_With_Coordinated_Node_and_Link_Mapping","316451467_On_the_Trade-Off_Between_Computational_Load_and_Reliability_for_Network_Function_Virtualization","308855122_Near_optimal_placement_of_virtual_network_functions","236158064_Virtual_Network_Embedding_A_Survey"]}
