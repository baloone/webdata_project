{"id":"309665201_Crash_Testing_an_Engineering_Framework_in_Neuroscience_Does_the_Idea_of_Robustness_Break_Down","abstract":"In this paper I discuss the concept of robustness in neuroscience. Various mechanisms for making systems robust have been discussed across biology and neuroscience (e.g. redundancy and fail-safes). Many of these notions originate from engineering. I argue that concepts borrowed from engineering aid neuroscientists in (1) operationalizing robustness; (2) formulating hypotheses about mechanisms for robustness; and (3) quantifying robustness. Furthermore, I argue that the significant disanalogies between brains and engineered artefacts raise important questions about the applicability of the engineering framework. I argue that the use of such concepts should be understood as a kind of simplifying idealization.","authors":["Mazviita Chirimuuta"],"meta":["October 2016Philosophy of Science 84(5)","DOI:10.1086/694084"],"references":["279806001_Recasting_brain-machine_interface_design_from_a_physical_control_system_perspective","301248041_Robust_neuronal_dynamics_in_premotor_cortex_during_motor_planning","275159470_Models_in_Physics","257563252_Thinking_Dynamically_About_Biological_Mechanisms_Networks_of_Coupled_Oscillators"]}
