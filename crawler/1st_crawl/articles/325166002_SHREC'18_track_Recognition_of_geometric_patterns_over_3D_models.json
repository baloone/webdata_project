{"id":"325166002_SHREC'18_track_Recognition_of_geometric_patterns_over_3D_models","abstract":"This track of the SHREC 2018 originally aimed at recognizing relief patterns over a set of triangle meshes from laser scan acquisitions of archaeological fragments. This track approaches a lively and very challenging problem that remains open after the end of the track. In this report we discuss the challenges to face to successfully address geometric pattern recognition over surfaces; how the existing techniques can go further in this direction, what is currently missing and what is necessary to be further developed.","authors":["Silvia Biasotti","Elia Moscoso Thompson","L Bathe","Stefano Berretti"],"meta":["January 2018","Project: GRAVITATE"],"references":["317426798_PointNet_Deep_Hierarchical_Feature_Learning_on_Point_Sets_in_a_Metric_Space","316190135_SHREC'17_Track_Retrieval_of_Surfaces_With_Similar_Relief_Patterns","309957405_Mesh_denoising_via_cascaded_normal_regression","294088342_Fisher_encoding_of_differential_fast_point_feature_histograms_for_partial_3D_object_retrieval","281438978_Support_Vector_Machines_for_Classification_of_Geometric_Primitives_in_Point_Clouds","262157586_Growing_Least_Squares_for_the_Analysis_of_Manifolds_in_Scale-Space","257406714_Combination_of_Bag-of-Words_Descriptors_for_Robust_Partial_Shape_Retrieval","226992714_Blowing_Bubbles_for_Multi-Scale_Analysis_and_Decomposition_of_Triangle_Meshes","322755382_Feature_Preserving_Mesh_Denoising_Based_on_Graph_Spectral_Processing","310952968_Geometric_Deep_Learning_Going_beyond_Euclidean_data"]}
