{"id":"249678915_Assessing_Media_Influences_on_Middle_School_Aged_Children's_Perceptions_of_Women_in_Science_Using_the_Draw-A-Scientist_Test_DAST","abstract":"Gender stereotypes in the mass media perpetuate traditional views of women that may influence children's perceptions of women in science, engineering, and technology. This study used a randomized posttest-only control group design to determine the efficacy of media literacy training on middle schoolâ€“aged children's perceptions of scientists. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: discussion, discussion plus viewing of television and film clips that featured images of women, or a control. A total of 304 seventh-grade students were asked to complete the Draw-A-Scientist Test and to write down the source of information for their drawings. Across conditions, boys were more likely than girls to draw male scientists, and girls were more likely than boys to draw female scientists. Boys also were more likely to depict other stereotypes of scientists. Media sources were listed as the primary source of information for the drawings.","authors":["Jocelyn Steinke","Maria Knight Lapinski","Nikki Crocker","Aletta Zietsman-Thomas"],"meta":["September
