{"id":"336622458_Design_and_Experimental_Validation_of_a_3-DOF_Underactuated_Pendulum-Like_Robot","abstract":"This paper presents the design and the experimental validation of a novel 3-degree-of-freedom (DOF) pendulum-like cable-driven robot capable of executing point-to-point motions by leveraging partial feedback linearization control and on-line trajectory planning based on adaptive frequency oscillators (AFOs). Unlike most cable-suspended parallel robots, which rely on at least n actuated cables to control n DOF, the proposed robot is capable of performing 3-DOF point-to-point motions, from a starting pose to a goal one within its dynamic workspace, by means of two actuators only. Feedback linearization allows the dynamics of the variable-length pendulum to be decoupled from the orientation of the end-effector, enabling the device to use parametric excitation to control the oscillations of the variable-length pendulum, akin to a playground swing. A pool of AFOs is introduced to enable smooth, lag-free on-line estimations of the current phase of the pendulum oscillation to inform the on-line planner and the parametric excitation controller. Experimental results demonstrate feasibility of the proposed design and control approach.","authors":["Lorenzo Scalera","Alessandro Gasparetto","Damiano Zanotto"],"meta":["October 2019IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TMECH.2019.2947915"],"references":["332450984_Multiaxis_Reaction_System_MARS_for_Vibration_Control_of_Planar_Cable-Driven_Parallel_Robots","330800244_Dynamically_feasible_motions_of_a_class_of_purely-translational_cable-suspended_parallel_robots","323396220_Nonlinear_model_predictive_control_for_trajectory_tracking_of_nonholonomic_mobile_robots_A_modified_approach","322402759_CBRC_Cable-Based_Robotic_Crane_design_and_implementation_of_overhead_travelling_cranes_based_on_variable_radius_drums","329845575_Experimental_Validation_of_a_Three-DOF_Cable-Suspended_Parallel_Robot_for_Spatial_Translation_with_Constant_Orientation","328837790_Dynamic_Trajectory_Planning_for_Failure_Recovery_in_Cable-Suspended_Camera_Systems","325497564_Dynamic_Point-to-Point_Trajectory_Planning_of_a_Three-DOF_Cable-Suspended_Mechanism_Using_the_Hypocycloid_Curve","324609927_Periodic_Trajectory_Planning_Beyond_the_Static_Workspace_for_6-DOF_Cable-Suspended_Parallel_Robots","323920004_Dynamically_Feasible_Periodic_Trajectories_for_Generic_Spatial_3-DOF_Cable-Suspended_Parallel_Robots","323269848_Dynamic_Point-to-Point_Trajectory_Planning_Beyond_the_Static_Workspace_for_Six-DOF_Cable-Suspended_Parallel_Robots"]}
