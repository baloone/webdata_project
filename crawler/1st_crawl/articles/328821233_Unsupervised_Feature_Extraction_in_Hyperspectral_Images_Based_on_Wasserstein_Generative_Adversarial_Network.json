{"id":"328821233_Unsupervised_Feature_Extraction_in_Hyperspectral_Images_Based_on_Wasserstein_Generative_Adversarial_Network","abstract":"Feature extraction (FE) is a crucial research area in hyperspectral image (HSI) processing. Recently, due to the powerful ability of deep learning (DL) to extract spatial and spectral features, DL-based FE methods have shown great potentials for HSI processing. However, most of the DL-based FE methods are supervised, and the training of them suffers from the absence of labeled samples in HSIs severely. The training issue of supervised DL-based FE methods limits their application on HSI processing. To address this issue, in this paper, a novel modified generative adversarial network (GAN) is proposed to train a DL-based feature extractor without supervision. The designed GAN consists of two components, which are a generator and a discriminator. The generator can focus on the learning of real probability distributions of data sets and the discriminator can extract spatial-spectral features with superior invariance effectively. In order to learn upsampling and downsampling strategies adaptively during FE, the proposed generator and discriminator are designed based on a fully deconvolutional subnetwork and a fully convolutional subnetwork, respectively. Moreover, a novel min-max cost function is designed for training the proposed GAN in an end-to-end fashion without supervision, by utilizing the zero-sum game relationship between the generator and discriminator. Besides, the proposed modified GAN replaces the original Jensen-Shannon divergence with the Wasserstein distance, aiming to mitigate the unstability and difficulty of the training of GAN frameworks. Experimental results on three real data sets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","authors":["Mingyang Zhang","Maoguo Gong","Yishun Mao","Jun Li"],"meta":["November 2018IEEE
