{"id":"329715894_An_explainable_deep-learning_algorithm_for_the_detection_of_acute_intracranial_haemorrhage_from_small_datasets","abstract":"Owing to improvements in image recognition via deep learning, machine-learning algorithms could eventually be applied to automated medical diagnoses that can guide clinical decision-making. However, these algorithms remain a ‘black box’ in terms of how they generate the predictions from the input data. Also, high-performance deep learning requires large, high-quality training datasets. Here, we report the development of an understandable deep-learning system that detects acute intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) and classifies five ICH subtypes from unenhanced head computed-tomography scans. By using a dataset of only 904 cases for algorithm training, the system achieved a performance similar to that of expert radiologists in two independent test datasets containing 200 cases (sensitivity of 98% and specificity of 95%) and 196 cases (sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 95%). The system includes an attention map and a prediction basis retrieved from training data to enhance explainability, and an iterative process that mimics the workflow of radiologists. Our approach to algorithm development can facilitate the development of deep-learning systems for a variety of clinical applications and accelerate their adoption into clinical practice. © 2018, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","authors":["Hyunkwang Lee","Sehyo Yune","Mohammad Mansouri","Myeongchan Kim"],"meta":["March 2019Nature Biomedical Engineering 3(3)","DOI:10.1038/s41551-018-0324-9"],"references":["336906206_Grad-CAM_Visual_Explanations_from_Deep_Networks_via_Gradient-Based_Localization","327191103_Multi-label_Class-imbalanced_Action_Recognition_in_Hockey_Videos_via_3D_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","325515977_RADnet_Radiologist_level_accuracy_using_deep_learning_for_hemorrhage_detection_in_CT_scans","324717135_Large_Scale_Automated_Reading_of_Frontal_and_Lateral_Chest_X-Rays_using_Dual_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","324212176_Advanced_machine_learning_in_action_identification_of_intracranial_hemorrhage_on_computed_tomography_scans_of_the_head_with_clinical_workflow_integration","323796532_Development_and_Validation_of_Deep_Learning_Algorithms_for_Detection_of_Critical_Findings_in_Head_CT_Scans","321095969_CheXNet_Radiologist-Level_Pneumonia_Detection_on_Chest_X-Rays_with_Deep_Learning","320413274_RADNET_Radiologist_Level_Accuracy_using_Deep_Learning_for_HEMORRHAGE_detection_in_CT_Scans","328241386_Deep_learning_algorithms_for_detection_of_critical_findings_in_head_CT_scans_a_retrospective_study","322058942_Grad-CAM_Visual_Explanations_from_Deep_Networks_via_Gradient-Based_Localization","319501508_Multi-label_Class-imbalanced_Action_Recognition_in_Hockey_Videos_via_3D_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","319415855_Predicting_Cardiovascular_Risk_Factors_from_Retinal_Fundus_Photographs_using_Deep_Learning","320344947_Application_of_Deep_Learning_in_Neuroradiology_Automated_Detection_of_Basal_Ganglia_Hemorrhage_using_2D-Convolutional_Neural_Networks","319770006_Learning_Deep_Features_for_Discriminative_Localization","318222226_Automated_Critical_Test_Findings_Identification_and_Online_Notification_System_Using_Artificial_Intelligence_in_Imaging"]}
