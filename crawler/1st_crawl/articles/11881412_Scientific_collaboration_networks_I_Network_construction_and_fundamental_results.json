{"id":"11881412_Scientific_collaboration_networks_I_Network_construction_and_fundamental_results","abstract":"Using computer databases of scientific papers in physics, biomedical research, and computer science, we have constructed networks of collaboration between scientists in each of these disciplines. In these networks two scientists are considered connected if they have coauthored one or more papers together. We study a variety of statistical properties of our networks, including numbers of papers written by authors, numbers of authors per paper, numbers of collaborators that scientists have, existence and size of a giant component of connected scientists, and degree of clustering in the networks. We also highlight some apparent differences in collaboration patterns between the subjects studied. In the following paper, we study a number of measures of centrality and connectedness in the same networks.","authors":["M.E.J.
