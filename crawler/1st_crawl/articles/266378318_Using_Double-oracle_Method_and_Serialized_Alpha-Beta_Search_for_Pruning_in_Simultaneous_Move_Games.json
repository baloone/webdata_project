{"id":"266378318_Using_Double-oracle_Method_and_Serialized_Alpha-Beta_Search_for_Pruning_in_Simultaneous_Move_Games","abstract":"We focus on solving two-player zero-sum extensive-form games with perfect information and simultaneous moves. In these games, both players fully observe the current state of the game where they simultaneously make a move determining the next state of the game. We solve these games by a novel algorithm that relies on two components: (1) it iteratively solves the games that correspond to a single simultaneous move using a double-oracle method, and (2) it prunes the states of the game us-ing bounds on the sub-game values obtained by the classical Alpha-Beta search on a serialized variant of the game. We experimentally evaluate our algorithm on the Goofspiel card game, a pursuit-evasion game, and randomly generated games. The results show that our novel algorithm typically provides significant running-time improvements and reduction in the number of evaluated nodes compared to the full search algorithm.","authors":["Branislav Bosansky","Viliam Lisý","Jiri Cermak","Roman Vítek"],"meta":["August 2013","Conference: 23rd International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI 2013)"],"references":["260583298_Monte_Carlo_Tree_Search_for_Collaboration_Control_of_Ghosts_in_Ms_Pac-Man","235891194_Extending_security_games_to_defenders_with_constrained_mobility","223073247_Alpha-Beta_Pruning_for_Games_with_Simultaneous_Moves","221456290_A_double_oracle_algorithm_for_zero-sum_security_games_on_graphs","272161464_Artificial_Intelligence_A_Modern_Approach_Second_Edition","259564355_Efficient_Monte_Carlo_Counterfactual_Regret_Minimization_in_Games_with_Many_Player_Actions","224182147_Fuego-An_Open-Source_Framework_for_Board_Games_and_Go_Engine_Based_on_Monte_Carlo_Tree_Search","221661738_The_Game_of_Pure_Strategy_is_solved","221442223_Heuristic_Search_Applied_to_Abstract_Combat_Games","221345955_Planning_in_the_Presence_of_Cost_Functions_Controlled_by_an_Adversary"]}
