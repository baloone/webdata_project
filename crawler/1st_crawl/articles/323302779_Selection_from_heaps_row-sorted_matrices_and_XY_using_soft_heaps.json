{"id":"323302779_Selection_from_heaps_row-sorted_matrices_and_XY_using_soft_heaps","abstract":"We use soft heaps to obtain simpler optimal algorithms for selecting the $k$-th smallest item, and the set of~$k$ smallest items, from a heap-ordered tree, from a collection of sorted lists, and from $X+Y$, where $X$ and $Y$ are two unsorted sets. Our results match, and in some ways extend and improve, classical results of Frederickson (1993) and Frederickson and Johnson (1982). In particular, for selecting the $k$-th smallest item, or the set of~$k$ smallest items, from a collection of~$m$ sorted lists we obtain a new optimal \"output-sensitive\" algorithm that performs only $O(m+\\sum_{i=1}^m \\log(k_i+1))$ comparisons, where $k_i$ is the number of items of the $i$-th list that belong to the overall set of~$k$ smallest items.","authors":["Haim Kaplan","László Kozma","Or Zamir","Uri Zwick"],"meta":["February 2018"],"references":["316679881_Near-optimal_linear_decision_trees_for_k-SUM_and_related_problems","45881688_Sorting_under_Partial_Information_without_the_Ellipsoid_Algorithm","266242651_Soft_Heaps_Simplified","262274777_Sorting_the_sums_X_i_Y_j_in_O_n_2_comparisons","257285751_An_Optimal_Algorithm_for_Selection_in_a_Min-Heap","247442902_Introduction_To_Algorithms","242930135_The_Optimum_Distribution_of_Effort","226265783_Balancing_poset_extensions","223810359_The_complexity_of_selection_and_ranking_in_X_Y_and_matrices_with_sorted_columns","222641595_How_good_is_the_information_theory_bound_in_sorting","222219413_Time_Bounds_for_Selection","221543588_Online_Sorted_Range_Reporting","220617637_Selecting_the_Median","220617086_Erratum_Generalized_Selection_and_Ranking_Sorted_Matrices","220617008_Generalized_Selection_and_Ranking_Sorted_Matrices","220574941_Entropy_and_Sorting","220574869_Finding_the_Median","220432402_An_optimal_minimum_spanning_tree_algorithm","220432308_The_soft_heap_An_approximate_priority_queue_with_optimal_error_rate","220431788_Chazelle_B_A_minimum_spanning_tree_algorithm_with_inverse-ackermann_type_complexity_Journal_of_the_ACM_476_1028-1047","220431587_Lower_Bounds_for_Selection_in_X_Y_and_Other_Multisets","220111177_A_Pseudo-Algorithmic_Separation_of_Lines_from_Pseudo-Lines","38366168_Estimates_of_Location_Based_on_Rank_Tests","2608926_Median_Selection_Requires_2en_Comparisons","2259686_Finding_the_k_Shortest_Paths"]}
