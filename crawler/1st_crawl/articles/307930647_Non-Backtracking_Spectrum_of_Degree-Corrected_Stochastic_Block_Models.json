{"id":"307930647_Non-Backtracking_Spectrum_of_Degree-Corrected_Stochastic_Block_Models","abstract":"Motivated by community detection, we characterise the spectrum of the non-backtracking matrix $B$ in the Degree-Corrected Stochastic Block Model. Specifically, we consider a random graph on $n$ vertices partitioned into two equal-sized clusters. The vertices have i.i.d. weights $\\{ \\phi_u \\}_{u=1}^n$ with second moment $\\Phi^{(2)}$. The intra-cluster connection probability for vertices $u$ and $v$ is $\\frac{\\phi_u \\phi_v}{n}a$ and the inter-cluster connection probability is $\\frac{\\phi_u \\phi_v}{n}b$. We show that with high probability, the following holds: The leading eigenvalue of the non-backtracking matrix $B$ is asymptotic to $\\rho = \\frac{a+b}{2} \\Phi^{(2)}$. The second eigenvalue is asymptotic to $\\mu_2 = \\frac{a-b}{2} \\Phi^{(2)}$ when $\\mu_2^2 > \\rho$, but asymptotically bounded by $\\sqrt{\\rho}$ when $\\mu_2^2 \\leq \\rho$. All the remaining eigenvalues are asymptotically bounded by $\\sqrt{\\rho}$. As a result, a clustering positively-correlated with the true communities can be obtained based on the second eigenvector of $B$ in the regime where $\\mu_2^2 > \\rho.$ In a previous work we obtained that detection is impossible when $\\mu_2^2 < \\rho,$ meaning that there occurs a phase-transition in the sparse regime of the Degree-Corrected Stochastic Block Model. As a corollary, we obtain that Degree-Corrected Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi graphs asymptotically satisfy the graph Riemann hypothesis, a quasi-Ramanujan property. A by-product of our proof is a weak law of large numbers for local-functionals on Degree-Corrected Stochastic Block Models, which could be of independent interest.","authors":["Lennart Gulikers","Marc Lelarge","Laurent MassouliÃ©"],"meta":["September 2016"],"references":["283471142_An_Impossibility_Result_for_Reconstruction_in_a_Degree-Corrected_Planted-Partition_Model","279458565_A_spectral_method_for_community_detection_in_moderately-sparse_degree-corrected_stochastic_block_models","271448122_Nonbacktracking_spectrum_of_random_graphs_Community_detection_and_nonregular_Ramanujan_graphs","258924057_Spectral_Redemption_in_Clustering_Sparse_Networks","258442326_Community_detection_thresholds_and_the_weak_Ramanujan_property","271105705_Reconstruction_and_estimation_in_the_planted_partition_model","268246172_Ramanujan_graphs","258566918_A_Proof_Of_The_Block_Model_Threshold_Conjecture","248494126_Zeta_Functions_of_Finite_Graphs_and_Representations_of_p-Adic_Groups","247650049_Stochastic_Blockmodels_First_Steps"]}
