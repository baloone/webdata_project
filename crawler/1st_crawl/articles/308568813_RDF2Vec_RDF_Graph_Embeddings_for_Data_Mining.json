{"id":"308568813_RDF2Vec_RDF_Graph_Embeddings_for_Data_Mining","abstract":"Linked Open Data has been recognized as a valuable source for background information in data mining. However, most data mining tools require features in propositional form, i.e., a vector of nominal or numerical features associated with an instance, while Linked Open Data sources are graphs by nature. In this paper, we present RDF2Vec, an approach that uses language modeling approaches for unsupervised feature extraction from sequences of words, and adapts them to RDF graphs. We generate sequences by leveraging local information from graph sub-structures, harvested by Weisfeiler-Lehman Subtree RDF Graph Kernels and graph walks, and learn latent numerical representations of entities in RDF graphs. Our evaluation shows that such vector representations outperform existing techniques for the propositionalization of RDF graphs on a variety of different predictive machine learning tasks, and that feature vector representations of general knowledge graphs such as DBpedia and Wikidata can be easily reused for different tasks.","authors":["Petar Ristoski","Heiko Paulheim"],"meta":["October 2016Lecture Notes in Computer Science","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-46523-4_30","Conference: International Semantic Web Conference"],"references":["300646445_Recommender_Systems_and_Linked_Open_Data","300410151_Scalable_Learning_of_Entity_and_Predicate_Embeddings_for_Knowledge_Graph_Completion","273157976_A_Review_of_Relational_Machine_Learning_for_Knowledge_Graphs_From_Multi-Relational_Link_Prediction_to_Automated_Knowledge_Graph_Construction","268348050_Two_pre-processing_operators_for_improved_learning_from_Semantic_Web_data","265592053_Data_Mining_with_Background_Knowledge_from_the_Web","264116822_A_Scalable_Approach_for_Statistical_Learning_in_Semantic_Graphs","259828897_DBpedia_-_A_Large-scale_Multilingual_Knowledge_Base_Extracted_from_Wikipedia","257882504_Distributed_Representations_of_Words_and_Phrases_and_their_Compositionality","234131319_Efficient_Estimation_of_Word_Representations_in_Vector_Space","233952505_Graph_Kernels_for_RDF_Data","233530327_KORE_Keyphrase_Overlap_Relatedness_for_Entity_Disambiguation","228722059_LiDDM_A_Data_Mining_System_for_Linked_Data","221466717_RELIN_Relatedness_and_Informativeness-Based_Centrality_for_Entity_Summarization","319770439_Efficient_Estimation_of_Word_Representations_in_Vector_Space","311479070_Knowledge_graph_refinement_A_survey_of_approaches_and_evaluation_methods","308569100_A_Collection_of_Benchmark_Datasets_for_Systematic_Evaluations_of_Machine_Learning_on_the_Semantic_Web","307955489_Distributed_representations_of_words_and_phrases_and_their_compositionality","299969948_Deep_Graph_Kernels","290767285_Adoption_of_the_Linked_Data_Best_Practices_in_Different_Topical_Domains","290366883_Exploiting_linked_open_data_as_background_knowledge_in_data_mining","289707166_Semantic_Web_in_data_mining_and_knowledge_discovery_A_comprehensive_survey","282627168_Mining_the_Web_of_Linked_Data_with_RapidMiner","281438037_Substructure_counting_graph_kernels_for_machine_learning_from_RDF_data","280081029_Wikidata_A_Free_Collaborative_Knowledgebase","265591957_A_Comparison_of_Propositionalization_Strategies_for_Creating_Features_from_Linked_Open_Data","261136952_DeepWalk_Online_Learning_of_Social_Representations","258940639_A_fast_and_simple_graph_kernel_for_RDF","256976145_A_Fast_Approximation_of_the_Weisfeiler-Lehman_Graph_Kernel_for_RDF_Data","254006763_Unsupervised_Generation_of_Data_Mining_Features_from_Linked_Open_Data","242424350_Propositionalization_Approaches_to_Relational_Data_Mining","228929800_Weisfeiler-Lehman_Graph_Kernels","226888613_A_Declarative_Kernel_for_mathcalALC_Concept_Descriptions","221614202_Automated_feature_generation_from_structured_knowledge","221466506_Kernel_Methods_for_Mining_Instance_Data_in_Ontologies"]}
