{"id":"343303172_New_technique_to_quantify_chaotic_dynamics_based_on_differences_between_semi-implicit_integration_schemes","abstract":"Many novel chaotic systems have recently been identified and numerically studied. Parametric chaotic sets are a valuable tool for determining and classifying oscillation regimes observed in nonlinear systems. Thus, efficient algorithms for the construction of parametric chaotic sets are of interest. This paper discusses the performance of algorithms used for plotting parametric chaotic sets, considering the chaotic Rossler, Newton-Leipnik and Marioka-Shimizu systems as examples. In this study, we compared four different approaches: calculation of largest Lyapunov exponents, statistical analysis of bifurcation diagrams, recurrence plots estimation and introduced the new analysis method based on differences between a couple of numerical models obtained by semi-implicit methods. The proposed technique allows one to distinguish the chaotic and periodic motion in nonlinear systems and does not require any additional procedures such as solutions normalization or the choice of initial divergence value which is certainly its advantage. We evaluated the performance of the algorithms with the two-stage approach. At the first stage, the required simulation time was estimated using the perceptual hash calculation. At the second stage, we examined the performance of the algorithms for plotting parametric chaotic sets with various resolutions. We explicitly demonstrated that the proposed algorithm has the best performance among all considered methods. Its implementation in the simulation and analysis software can speed up the calculations when obtaining high-resolution multi-parametric chaotic sets for complex nonlinear systems.","authors":["Denis Butusov","Dmitrii O.
