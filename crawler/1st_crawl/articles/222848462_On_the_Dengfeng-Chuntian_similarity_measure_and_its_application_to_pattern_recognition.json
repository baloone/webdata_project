{"id":"222848462_On_the_Dengfeng-Chuntian_similarity_measure_and_its_application_to_pattern_recognition","abstract":"Recently Dengfeng and Chuntian defined the first operational definition of a similarity measure for intuitionistic fuzzy sets and showed how it may be used in pattern recognition problems. Unfortunately the Dengfeng and Chuntian operator may give counter-intuitive results. We show how a simple modification of the Dengfengâ€“Chuntian operator may correct this problem. We illustrate the application of the modified similarity measure on a simple pattern recognition problem.","authors":["Harvey Mitchell"],"meta":["December 2003Pattern Recognition Letters 24(16):3101-3104","DOI:10.1016/S0167-8655(03)00169-7","SourceDBLP"],"references":["292214851_Using_statistical_viewpoint_in_developing_correlation_of_intuitionistic_fuzzy_sets","256992299_Intuitionistic_Fuzzy_Sets_Fuzzy_Sets_Syst","242799948_Correlation_of_interval-valued_intuitionistic_fuzzy_sets","222801646_Correlation_of_intuitionistic_fuzzy_sets_in_probability_spaces","222597676_More_on_intuitionistic_fuzzy_sets","220646319_New_similarity_measures_of_intuitionistic_fuzzy_sets_and_application_to_pattern_recognitions","220354999_Using_Statistical_Viewpoint_in_Developing_Correlation_of_Intuitionistic_Fuzzy_Sets"]}
