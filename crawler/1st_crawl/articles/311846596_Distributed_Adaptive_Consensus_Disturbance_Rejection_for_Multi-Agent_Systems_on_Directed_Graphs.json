{"id":"311846596_Distributed_Adaptive_Consensus_Disturbance_Rejection_for_Multi-Agent_Systems_on_Directed_Graphs","abstract":"This paper considers the distributed consensus disturbance rejection problem for general linear multi-agent systems with deterministic disturbances under directed communication graphs. Based on the relative state information of the neighboring agents, the consensus protocols, which consist of two observers, including a state observer and a separate disturbance observer, are designed to guarantee that the consensus error goes to zero with complete disturbance rejection. Furthermore, the state observer is designed in a fully distributed fashion with adaptive coupling gain, which has the advantage that the consensus controller design is independent of the Laplacian matrix associated with the communication network. The distributed observer-based consensus disturbance rejection protocols are further extended to containment control. Finally, an example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategies.","authors":["Junyong Sun","Zhiyong Geng","Yuezu Lv","Zhongkui Li"],"meta":["December 2016IEEE Transactions on Control of Network Systems 5(1)","DOI:10.1109/TCNS.2016.2641800"],"references":["283827094_Network_Synchronization_with_Nonlinear_Dynamics_and_Switching_Interactions","283531770_Fully_Distributed_Adaptive_Output_Feedback_Protocols_for_Linear_Multi-Agent_Systems_with_Directed_Graphs_A_Sequential_Observer_Design_Approach","283005763_Disturbance_Observer-Based_Control_and_Related_Methods_An_Overview","277723000_Multiplex_PI-Control_for_Consensus_in_Networks_of_Heterogeneous_Linear_Agents","272411787_Adaptive_output_feedback_consensus_tracking_for_linear_multi-agent_systems_with_unknown_dynamics","269293408_Consensus-based_cooperative_formation_control_with_collision_avoidance_for_a_multi-UAV_system","266676022_How_Much_Control_is_Enough_for_Network_Connectivity_Preservation_and_Collision_Avoidance","262343390_Distributed_cal_H_infty_Consensus_of_Higher_Order_Multiagent_Systems_With_Switching_Topologies","261440003_Convergence_and_synchronization_in_heterogeneous_networks_of_smooth_and_piecewise_smooth_systems","260586859_Global_H_consensus_of_multi-agent_systems_with_Lipschitz_non-linear_dynamics","259483042_Designing_Fully_Distributed_Consensus_Protocols_for_Linear_Multi-Agent_Systems_With_Directed_Graphs","239947228_Robustness_to_noise_in_synchronization_of_complex_networks","51698661_Pinning_control_of_complex_networks_via_edge_snapping","24432650_Distributed_Consensus_Filtering_in_Sensor_Networks","345255552_Disturbance_Observer-Based_Control_Methods_and_Applications","312890364_Consensus_seeking_in_multi-agent_systems_under_dynamically_changing_interaction_topologies","310402981_Consensus_of_multi-agent_systems_and_synchronization_of_complex_networks_A_unified_viewpoint","299401560_A_Truncated_Prediction_Approach_to_Consensus_Control_of_Lipschitz_Nonlinear_Multi-Agent_Systems_with_Input_Delay","292215410_Consensus_problems_in_networks_of_agents_with_switching_topology_and_time-delays","286033418_Distributed_finite-time_tracking_of_multiple_non-identical_second-order_nonlinear_systems_with_settling_time_estimation","283349744_Consensus_Control_of_a_Class_of_Lipschitz_Nonlinear_Systems_With_Input_Delay","282989341_Consensus_of_multi-agent_systems_with_state_constraints_A_unified_view_of_opinion_dynamics_and_containment_control","282522311_Containment_of_Higher-Order_Multi-Leader_Multi-Agent","279239852_Consensus_Disturbance_Rejection_With_Disturbance_Observers","276396841_Distributed_Synchronization_Control_of_Multiagent_Systems_With_Unknown_Nonlinearities","271538247_Adaptive_consensus_tracking_for_linear_multi-agent_systems_with_heterogeneous_unknown_nonlinear_dynamics","267928736_Adaptive_consensus_output_regulation_of_a_class_of_nonlinear_systems_with_unknown_high-frequency_gain","262410586_Finite-time_consensus_and_collision_avoidance_control_algorithms_for_multiple_AUVs","262321406_Robust_cooperative_tracking_for_multiple_non-identical_second-order_nonlinear_systems","260516629_Distributed_Tracking_Control_for_Linear_Multiagent_Systems_With_a_Leader_of_Bounded_Unknown_Input","256660583_Distributed_containment_control_with_multiple_stationary_or_dynamic_leaders_in_fixed_and_switching_directed_networks","241686288_Distributed_control_gains_design_for_consensus_in_multi-agent_systems_with_second-order_nonlinear_dynamics","236147361_Reaching_a_Consensus","235057542_Nonlinear_Control_Systems","234060452_Low-Frequency_Learning_and_Fast_Adaptation_inModel_Reference_Adaptive_Control","229890737_Disturbance_attenuation_and_rejection_for_systems_with_nonlinearity_via_DOBC_approach","229885746_Consensus_of_second-order_multi-agent_systems_with_exogenous_disturbances","224950388_Global_Bounded_Consensus_of_Multiagent_Systems_With_Nonidentical_Nodes_and_Time_Delays","224171074_A_Class_of_Bounded_Distributed_Control_Strategies_for_Connectivity_Preservation_in_Multi-Agent_Systems","224166606_Flocking_of_Multiple_Mobile_Robots_Based_on_Backstepping","222297939_On_pinning_synchronization_of_complex_dynamical_networks","222251026_Global_stablization_and_disturbance_suppression_of_a_class_of_nonlinear_systems_with_uncetain_internal_model","220625234_Consensus_of_Multiagent_Systems_and_Synchronization_of_Complex_Networks_A_Unified_Viewpoint","220624529_Distributed_Higher_Order_Consensus_Protocols_in_Multiagent_Dynamical_Systems","220387385_Distributed_Coordinated_Tracking_With_Reduced_Interaction_via_a_Variable_Structure_Approach","220158700_Consensus_of_High-order_Linear_Systems_Using_Dynamic_Output_Feedback_Compensator_Low_Gain_Approach","3032345_Asymptotic_Rejection_of_General_Periodic_Disturbances_in_Output-Feedback_Nonlinear_Systems"]}
