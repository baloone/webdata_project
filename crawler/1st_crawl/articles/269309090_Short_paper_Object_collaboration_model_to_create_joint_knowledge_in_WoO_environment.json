The Semantic Ontology models representing device, resource and service model into virtual objects to interconnect and transmit data and attributes of each various things will create the knowledge. This paper will provide the Semantic Ontology model and use case with collaboration of objects to create service knowledge in WoO Environment.","authors":["Sang Hum Lee","Ilyoung Chong"],"meta":["March 2014","DOI:10.1109/WF-IoT.2014.6803119","Conference: 2014 IEEE World Forum on Internet of Things (WF-IoT)"],"references":["224439784_The_SENSEI_project_Integrating_the_physical_world_with_the_digital_world_of_the_network_of_the_future","220726544_Service_Modelling_for_Internet_of_Things","312388417_Service_modeling_for_the_Internet_of_Things","264067108_Device_Objectification_and_Orchestration_Mechanism_for_IoT_Intelligent_Service","261456014_User-centric_intelligence_provisioning_in_web-of-objects_based_IoT_service"]}
