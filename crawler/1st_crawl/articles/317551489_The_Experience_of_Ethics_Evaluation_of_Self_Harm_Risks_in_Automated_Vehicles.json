{"id":"317551489_The_Experience_of_Ethics_Evaluation_of_Self_Harm_Risks_in_Automated_Vehicles","abstract":"Automated vehicles, but also safety or driver\nassistance systems for manually driven cars, will soon face\nsituations where they have to choose between several options\nwith negative or even lethal outcome for the one or the\nother party. Experimental ethics is an approach to evaluate\nexpectations humans put into the morality of digital agents.\nWith this work we present a personalized abstraction of the\n“Trolley Problem” evaluated in a driving simulator. The aim of\nthe study was to assess drivers’ individual attitudes in ethical\ndecisions and derive common knowledge about how to solve\nsuch situations. In contrast to previous work, the study at hand\nlooks at the problem from a holistic point of view, including\nuncertainty and accident risk (presented to subjects as their\nprobability to survive). Furthermore, subjective scales and semistructured\ninterviews to determine subjects’ justifications for\nethical decisions complemented the setting. Our results (n=40)\nsuggest that most drivers want their vehicles to act in an\nutilitarian way and opt for the more severe collision - even when\ntheir own probability to survive is substantially low. In addition,\nage and size of the injured party have a significant effect\non the results. Qualitative data (interviews) indicate that the\njustification, in particular for decisions with the same outcome,\nstrongly differs as most people have embodied their own moral\nconcepts.","authors":["Philipp Wintersberger","Anna Katharina Frison","Andreas Riener","Sinan Hasirlioglu"],"meta":["June 2017","DOI:10.1109/IVS.2017.7995749","Conference: IEEE Intelligent Vehicles SymposiumAt: Redondo Beach CAVolume: 28","Project: Human Factors in Highly Automated Driving"],"references":["304926538_The_Ethics_of_Accident-Algorithms_for_Self-Driving_Cars_An_Applied_Trolley_Problem","303847524_Will_My_Next_Car_Be_a_Libertarian_or_a_Utilitarian_Who_Will_Decide","303380943_Can_you_program_ethics_into_a_self-driving_car","301293464_The_Social_Dilemma_of_Autonomous_Vehicles","300567119_Machine_Ethics_and_Automated_Vehicles","299640195_From_Trolley_to_Autonomous_Vehicle_Perceptions_of_Responsibility_and_Moral_Norms_in_Traffic_Accidents_with_Self-Driving_Cars","232536375_A_Taxonomy_of_Ethical_Ideologies","225493059_Ethics_and_technology_design","284949568_An_Objective_Study_of_Some_Moral_Judgments","226792451_Toward_the_Development_of_a_Multidimensional_Scale_for_Improving_Evaluations_of_Business_Ethics"]}
