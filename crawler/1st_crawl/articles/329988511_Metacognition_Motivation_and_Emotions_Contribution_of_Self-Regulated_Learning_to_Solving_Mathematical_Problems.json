It is also the most difficult for elementary-school students (Verschaffel, Greer, & De Corte, 2000). Students experience cognitive and metacognitive difficulties in this area and develop negative emotions and poor motivation, which hamper their efforts (4 T Kramarski,3 T 4 T 3 T 4 T Weiss, & Kololshi-Minsker4 T , 2010).
