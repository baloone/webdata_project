This technique is based on in situ and non-volatile tuning of the sp2 domain to sp3 domain fraction (sp2/sp3 fraction) in GO through an electrochemical redox reaction achieved by solid electrolyte thin films. The all-solid-state variable PL device was fabricated by GO and proton-conducting mesoporous SiO2 thin films, which showed extremely low PL background. The device successfully tuned the PL peak wavelength in very wide range from 393 to 712 nm, covering that for chemically tuned GO, by adjusting the applied DC voltage within several hundred seconds. We also demonstrate the sp2/sp3 fraction tuning using conductive atomic force microscope (CAFM). The device achieved not only writing, but also erasing of sp2/sp3-fraction-tuned nanodomain (both directions operation). The combination of these techniques is applicable to a wide range of nano-optoelectronic devices including non-volatile PL memory devices and on-demand rewritable biosensors that can be integrated into nano and micro tips which are transparent, ultrathin, flexible and low cost.","authors":["Takashi Tsuchiya","Tohru Tsuruoka","Kazuya Terabe","Masakazu Aono"],"meta":["January 2015ACS Nano
