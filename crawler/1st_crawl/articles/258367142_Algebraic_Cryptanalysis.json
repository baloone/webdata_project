{"id":"258367142_Algebraic_Cryptanalysis","abstract":"Algebraic Cryptanalysis bridges the gap between a course in cryptography, and being able to read the cryptanalytic literature. This book is divided into three parts: Part One covers the process of turning a cipher into a system of equations; Part Two covers finite field linear algebra; Part Three covers the solution of Polynomial Systems of Equations, with a survey of the methods used in practice, including SAT-solvers and the methods of Nicolas Courtois. The cipher Keeloq, used in nearly all automobiles with remote key-less entry, is described as a running example, including the manipulation of the equations to enable their solution. The stream cipher Trivium, along with its variants Bivium-A and Bivium-B, and the stream cipher family QUAD are also analyzed as extensive examples, including summaries of several published attacks. Additional topics include: Analytic Combinatorics, and its application to cryptanalysis The equicomplexity of linear algebra operations Graph coloring Factoring integers via the quadratic sieve, with its applications to the cryptanalysis of RSA Algebraic Cryptanalysis is designed for advanced-level students in computer science and mathematics as a secondary text or reference book for self-guided study. This book is particularly suitable for researchers in Applied Abstract Algebra or Algebraic Geometry who wish to find more applied topics, practitioners working for security and communications companies, or intelligence agencies.
