{"id":"242668159_Solving_the_Teacher_Assignment-Course_Scheduling_Problem_by_a_Hybrid_Algorithm","abstract":"This paper presents a hybrid algorithm for solving a timetabling problem, which is commonly encountered in many universities. The problem combines both teacher assignment and course scheduling problems simultaneously, and is presented as a mathematical programming model. However, this problem becomes intractable and it is unlikely that a proven optimal solution can be obtained by an integer programming approach, especially for large problem instances. A hybrid algorithm that combines an integer programming approach, a greedy heuristic and a modified simulated annealing algorithm collaboratively is proposed to solve the problem. Several randomly generated data sets of sizes comparable to that of an institution in Indonesia are solved using the proposed algorithm. Computational results indicate that the algorithm can overcome difficulties of large problem sizes encountered in previous related works.","authors":["Aldy Gunawan","Kien Ming Ng","Kim Leng Poh"],"meta":["January 2007"],"references":["256401248_Azo_dyes_Structure-carcinogenicity_relationships","254154513_Ferric_Chloride_and_Alum_as_Single_and_Dual_Coagulants","244143165_Decolorization_of_Disperse_and_Reactive_Dyes_by_Continuous_Electrocoagulation_Process","233300729_Removal_of_bentonite_causing_turbidity_by_electro-coagulation","231372093_Electrodissolution_of_Aluminum_Electrodes_in_Electrocoagulation_Processes","223765026_Electrocoagulation_and_separation_of_aqueous_suspensions_of_ultrafine_particles","223574387_Studies_on_the_decolorization_of_textile_dye_wastewater_by_continuous_electrocoagulation_process","223474751_Testing_an_electrochemical_method_for_treatment_of_textile_dye_wastewater","223434303_Effect_of_initial_pH_and_supporting_electrolyte_on_the_treatment_of_water_containing_high_concentration_of_humic_substances_by_electrocoagulation","223286505_Optimization_of_CI_Acid_Red_14_Azo_Dye_Removal_by_Electrocoagulation_Batch_Process_with_Response_Surface_Methodology"]}
