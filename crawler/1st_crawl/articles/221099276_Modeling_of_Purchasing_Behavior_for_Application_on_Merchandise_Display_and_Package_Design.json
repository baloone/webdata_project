{"id":"221099276_Modeling_of_Purchasing_Behavior_for_Application_on_Merchandise_Display_and_Package_Design","abstract":"In this study, we modeled customer purchasing behavior in a retail store using a Bayesian network-based probabilistic modeling\ntool to apply towards improving merchandise display and package design. The following four aspects of purchasing behavior\nwere examined: purchasing gestures, glances made during the selection of merchandise, customer psychology concerning purchasing,\nand body information, including age, height, gender, eyesight, and dominant hand. To monitor purchasing behavior, three college\nstudents fitted with an eye tracker were asked to select the most appealing product among twenty-five snack food products \nthat were displayed on five-tier shelving. Factors affecting customersâ€™ merchandise selection in the experimental retail store\nwere then computed using a Bayesian network, and a purchasing behavior model was constructed from the results. Using the constructed\nmodel, a method of effective merchandise display based on the characteristics of retail purchasing behavior was proposed.","authors":["Kotaro Suzuki","Nobuyuki Nishiuchi","Mi Kyong Park"],"meta":["January 2011","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-22095-1_40","SourceDBLP","Conference: HCI International 2011 - Posters' Extended Abstracts - International Conference, HCI International 2011, Orlando, FL, USA, July 9-14, 2011, Proceedings, Part II"],"references":["304179814_Akaike's_Information_Criterion"]}
