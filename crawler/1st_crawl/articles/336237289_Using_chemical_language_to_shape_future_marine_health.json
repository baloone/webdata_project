{"id":"336237289_Using_chemical_language_to_shape_future_marine_health","abstract":"“Infochemicals” (information-conveying\nchemicals) dominate much of the underwater communication in biological systems.\nThey influence the movement and behavior of organisms, the ecological interactions between and across populations, and the\ntrophic structure of marine food webs. However, relative to their terrestrial equivalents, the wider ecological and economic importance\nof marine infochemicals remains understudied and a concerted, cross-disciplinary\neffort is needed to reveal the full potential\nof marine chemical ecology. We highlight current challenges with specific examples and suggest how research on the chemical\necology of marine organisms could provide opportunities for implementing new management solutions for future “blue growth”\n(the sustainable use of ocean resources) and maintaining healthy marine ecosystems.","authors":["Mahasweta Saha","Thomas Wichard","Patrick Fink","Erik Selander"],"meta":["October 2019Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment 17(9)","DOI:10.1002/fee.2113","Project: Chemical communication networks in Posidonia seagrass meadows"],"references":["331250059_Copepods_drive_large-scale_trait-mediated_effects_in_marine_plankton","320906117_Minireview_algal_natural_compounds_and_extracts_as_antifoulants","318821641_Volatile_Metabolites_Emission_by_In_Vivo_Microalgae-An_Overlooked_Opportunity","317765382_Zooming_in_on_the_phycosphere_The_ecological_interface_for_phytoplankton-bacteria_relationships","315698974_Effect_of_Ocean_Acidi_fi_cation_on_the_Communications_among_Invertebrates_Mediated_by_Plant-Produced_Volatile_Organic_Compounds","333684448_Purification_of_sporulation_and_swarming_inhibitors_from_Ulva","328299177_Volatile_Biomarkers_for_Aquatic_Ecological_Research","324216332_Harnessing_ecological_processes_to_facilitate_coral_restoration","322159031_Macroalgal-bacterial_interactions_Role_of_dimethylsulfoniopropionate_in_microbial_gardening_by_Ulva_Chlorophyta","316518129_Taste_and_smell_in_aquatic_and_terrestrial_environments"]}
