{"id":"279968736_A_review_of_the_literature_on_citation_impact_indicators","abstract":"Citation impact indicators nowadays play an important role in research\nevaluation, and consequently these indicators have received a lot of attention\nin the bibliometric and scientometric literature. This paper provides an\nin-depth review of the literature on citation impact indicators. First, an\noverview is given of the literature on bibliographic databases that can be used\nto calculate citation impact indicators (Web of Science, Scopus, and Google\nScholar). Next, selected topics in the literature on citation impact indicators\nare reviewed in detail. The first topic is the selection of publications and\ncitations to be included in the calculation of citation impact indicators. The\nsecond topic is the normalization of citation impact indicators, in particular\nnormalization for field differences. Counting methods for dealing with\nco-authored publications are the third topic, and citation impact indicators\nfor journals are the last topic. The paper concludes by offering some\nrecommendations for future research.","authors":["Ludo Waltman"],"meta":["July 2015Journal of Informetrics
