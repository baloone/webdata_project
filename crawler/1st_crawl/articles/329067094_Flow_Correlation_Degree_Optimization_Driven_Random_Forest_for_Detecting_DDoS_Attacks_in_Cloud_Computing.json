{"id":"329067094_Flow_Correlation_Degree_Optimization_Driven_Random_Forest_for_Detecting_DDoS_Attacks_in_Cloud_Computing","abstract":"Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) has caused major damage to cloud computing, and the false- and missing-alarm rates of existing DDoS attack-detection methods are relatively high in cloud environment. In this paper, we propose a DDoS attack-detection method with enhanced random forest (RF) optimized by genetic algorithm based on flow correlation degree (FCD) feature. We define the FCD feature according to the asymmetric and semidirectivity interaction characteristics and use the two-tuples FCD feature consisting of packet-statistical degree (PSD) and semidirectivity interaction abnormality (SDIA) to describe the features of attack flow and normal flow. Then we use a genetic algorithm based on the FCD feature sequences to optimize two key parameters of the decision tree in the RF: the maximum number of decision trees and the maximum depth of every single decision tree. We apply the trained RF model with optimized parameters to generate the classifier to be used for DDoS attack-detection. The experiment shows that the proposed method can effectively detect DDoS attacks in cloud environment with a higher accuracy rate and lower false- and missing-alarm rates compared to existing DDoS attack-detection methods.","authors":["Jieren Cheng","Mengyang Li","Xiangyan Tang","Victor Sheng"],"meta":["November 2018Security and Communication Networks 2018(3):1-14","DOI:10.1155/2018/6459326"],"references":["350153694_An_Abnormal_Network_Flow_Feature_Sequence_Prediction_Approach_for_DDoS_Attacks_Detection_in_Big_Data_Environment","336524893_Privacy-Preserving_and_Scalable_Service_Recommendation_Based_on_SimHash_in_a_Distributed_Cloud_Environment","324752674_Privacy-Aware_Multidimensional_Mobile_Service_Quality_Prediction_and_Recommendation_in_Distributed_Fog_Environment","323408831_An_ID-Based_Linearly_Homomorphic_Signature_Scheme_and_Its_Application_in_Blockchain","323406544_A_Short_Linearly_Homomorphic_Proxy_Signature_Scheme","328770013_A_practical_approach_to_detection_of_distributed_denial-of-service_attacks_using_a_hybrid_detection_method","326825545_Privacy-Aware_Data_Publishing_and_Integration_for_Collaborative_Service_Recommendation","324496705_A_two-stage_locality-sensitive_hashing_based_approach_for_privacy-preserving_mobile_service_recommendation_in_cross-platform_edge_environment","323418970_Differentially_Private_Naive_Bayes_Learning_over_Multiple_Data_Sources","323404451_Privacy-Preserving_Naive_Bayes_Classifiers_Secure_against_the_Substitution-then-Comparison_Attack"]}
