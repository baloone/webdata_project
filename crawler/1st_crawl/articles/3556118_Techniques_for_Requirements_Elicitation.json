{"id":"3556118_Techniques_for_Requirements_Elicitation","abstract":"The authors survey and evaluate techniques for eliciting\nrequirements of computer-based systems, paying particular attention to\ndealing with social issues. The methods surveyed include introspection,\ninterviews, questionnaires, and protocol, conversation, interaction, and\ndiscourse analyses. The last three techniques grew out of\nethnomethodology and sociolinguistics. They can elicit tacit knowledge\nby observing actual interactions in the workplace, and can also be\napplied to the system development process itself","authors":["J.A.
