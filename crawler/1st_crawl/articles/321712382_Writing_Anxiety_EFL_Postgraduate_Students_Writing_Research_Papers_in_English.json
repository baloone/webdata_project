Four postgraduate students (three Thai and one Chinese) studying in the first-year international PhD program in Applied Linguistics were asked to submit their research papers at the end of the course. The Second Language Writing Anxiety Inventory (SLWAI) questionnaire was administered in Weeks 10 and 14 to assess their anxiety levels while they were writing their papers. A semi-structured interview was used to elicit the causes of writing anxiety and coping strategies. The results show that the factors causing anxiety about their writing were: teachers and grading. Lekiâ€™s (1995) framework of coping strategies reveal that these participants frequently used Focusing strategies and Stopping writing when they wrote research papers in English.","authors":["Mona Rungruangthum"],"meta":["June 2011Journal of English Studies 6"],"references":["274704333_An_investigation_on_the_language_anxiety_and_fear_of_negative_evaluation_among_Turkish_EFL_Learners","250734266_First_publications_in_refereed_English_journals_Difficulties_coping_strategies_and_recommendations_for_student_training","247867156_The_Empirical_Development_of_an_Instrument_to_Measure_Writing_Apprehension","238683569_The_Effects_of_Portfolio_Keeping_on_Writing_Anxiety_of_EFL_Students","222403438_A_measure_of_second_language_writing_anxiety_Scale_development_and_preliminary_validation","307981795_Qualitative_Interviewing_The_Art_of_Hearing_Data","286593854_Writing_performance_relative_to_writing_apprehension_self-efficacy_in_writing_and_attitudes_towards_writing_A_correlational_study_in_Turkish_tertiary-level_EFL","260354102_Coping_Strategies_of_ESL_Students_in_Writing_Tasks_Across_the_Curriculum","242127244_English_Language_Teaching_and_Learning_in_Thailand_in_this_Decade","240534872_Writing_Apprehension_Computer_Anxiety_and_Telecomputing_a_pilot_study","240273436_Teaching_English_as_a_foreign_or_second_language_A_teacher_self-development_and_methodology_guide","222493484_Problems_in_writing_for_scholarly_publication_in_English_The_case_of_Hong_Kong_Journal_of_Second_Language_Writing_83_243-264"]}
