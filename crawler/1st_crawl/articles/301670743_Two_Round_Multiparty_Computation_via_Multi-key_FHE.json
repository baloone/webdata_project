{"id":"301670743_Two_Round_Multiparty_Computation_via_Multi-key_FHE","abstract":"We construct a general multiparty computation (MPC) protocol with only two rounds of interaction in the common random string model, which is known to be optimal. In the honest-but-curious setting we only rely on the learning with errors (LWE) assumption, and in the fully malicious setting we additionally assume the existence of non-interactive zero knowledge arguments (NIZKs). Previously, Asharov et al. (EUROCRYPT ’12) showed how to achieve three rounds based on LWE and NIZKs, while Garg et al. (TCC ’14) showed how to achieve the optimal two rounds based on indistinguishability obfuscation, but it was unknown if two rounds were possible under standard assumptions without obfuscation.\nOur approach relies on multi-key fully homomorphic encryption (MFHE), introduced by Lopez-Alt et al. (STOC ’12), which enables homomorphic computation over data encrypted under different keys. We present a construction of MFHE based on LWE that significantly simplifies a recent scheme of Clear and McGoldrick (CRYPTO ’15). We then extend this construction to allow for a one-round distributed decryption of a multi-key ciphertext. Our entire MPC protocol consists of the following two rounds:1.\nEach party individually encrypts its input under its own key and broadcasts the ciphertext. All parties can then homomorphically compute a multi-key encryption of the output.\n2.\nEach party broadcasts a partial decryption of the output using its secret key. The partial decryptions can be combined to recover the output in plaintext.","authors":["Pratyay Mukherjee","Daniel Wichs"],"meta":["May 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-3-662-49896-5_26","Conference: Annual International Conference on the Theory and Applications of Cryptographic Techniques"],"references":["234778924_How_to_play_ANY_mental_game","226420609_Computationally_private_randomizing_polynomials_and_their_applications","225991062_Semi-homomorphic_Encryption_and_Multiparty_Computation","221355083_Universally_Composable_Efficient_Multiparty_Computation_from_Threshold_Homomorphic_Encryption","221326837_Mix_and_Match_Secure_Function_Evaluation_via_Ciphertexts","220336964_Threshold_Decryption_and_Zero-Knowledge_Proofs_for_Lattice-Based_Cryptosystems","2395809_Multiparty_Computation_from_Threshold_Homomorphic_Encryption","301670595_The_Exact_Round_Complexity_of_Secure_Computation","299487912_Two-Round_Adaptively_Secure_MPC_from_Indistinguishability_Obfuscation","290883644_Multi-identity_and_Multi-key_Leveled_FHE_from_Learning_with_Errors","267441252_Homomorphic_Encryption_from_Learning_with_Errors_Conceptually-Simpler_Asymptotically-Faster_Attribute-Based","267436585_Two-Round_Secure_MPC_from_Indistinguishability_Obfuscation","266955589_Faster_Bootstrapping_with_Polynomial_Error","262246911_Round_complexity_of_secure_protocols","241623672_On-the-fly_multiparty_computation_on_the_cloud_via_multikey_fully_homomorphic_encryption","237403249_RoundE-ciency_ofMulti-Party_Computation_with_a_Dishonest_Majority","221591851_How_to_Play_any_Mental_Game_or_A_Completeness_Theorem_for_Protocols_with_Honest_Majority","221591366_Fully_Homomorphic_Encryption_Using_Ideal_Lattices","221591170_Public-key_Cryptosystems_from_the_Worst-case_Shortest_Vector_Problem","221591132_On_Lattices_Learning_with_Errors_Random_Linear_Codes_and_Cryptography","221590569_The_Round_Complexity_of_Secure_Protocols_Extended_Abstract","221590224_Constant-Round_Nonmalleable_Commitments_from_Any_One-Way_Function","221499819_Protocols_for_Secure_Computations_Extended_Abstract","221499521_Randomizing_Polynomials_A_New_Representation_with_Applications_to_Round-Efficient_Secure_Computation","221499260_Efficient_Fully_Homomorphic_Encryption_from_Standard_LWE","221498631_How_to_Generate_and_Exchange_Secrets_Extended_Abstract","221355073_Secure_Computation_on_the_Web_Computing_without_Simultaneous_Interaction","220431624_On_lattices_learning_with_errors_random_linear_codes_and_cryptography","220336427_Constant_Round_Non-Malleable_Protocols_using_One_Way_Functions","220335581_Trapdoors_for_Lattices_Simpler_Tighter_Faster_Smaller","220334983_Constant-Round_Non-Malleable_Commitments_from_Any_One-Way_Function","220333428_Multiparty_Computation_with_Low_Communication_Computation_and_Interaction_via_Threshold_FHE","220333201_Threshold_Fully_Homomorphic_Encryption_and_Secure_Computation","220138781_Leveled_Fully_Homomorphic_Encryption_without_Bootstrapping","2893237_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","2892539_Round-Optimal_Secure_Two-Party_Computation","2485823_Parallel_Coin-Tossing_and_Constant-Round_Secure_Two-Party_Computation"]}
