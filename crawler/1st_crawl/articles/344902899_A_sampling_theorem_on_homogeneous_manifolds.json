{"id":"344902899_A_sampling_theorem_on_homogeneous_manifolds","abstract":"We consider a generalization of entire functions of spherical exponential type and Lagrangian splines on manifolds. An analog of the Paley-Wiener theorem is given. We also show that every spectral entire function on a manifold is uniquely determined by its values on some discrete sets of points.\nThe main result of the paper is a formula for reconstruction of spectral entire functions from their values on discrete sets using Lagrangian splines.","authors":["Isaac Pesenson"],"meta":["April 2000Transactions of the American Mathematical Society 352(9):4257-4269","DOI:10.1090/S0002-9947-00-02592-7"],"references":["307712895_Reconstruction_of_Paley-Wiener_functions_on_the_Heisenberg_group","254206198_Finite_propagation_speed_kernel_estimates_for_functions_of_the_Laplace_operator_and_the_geometry_of_complete_Riemannian_manifolds","316793119_Non-Homogeneous_Boundary_Value_Problems_and_Applications","315328913_An_index_theorem_on_open_manifolds_I","284681456_Base_d'ondelettes_sur_les_groupes_de_Lie_stratifies","265535962_The_Bernstein_inequality_in_representations_of_Lie_groups","265431407_Cardinal_Spline_Interpolation","245386823_Analysis_of_the_Laplacian_on_a_Complete_Riemannian_Manifold","244512143_The_Recovery_of_Irregularly_Sampled_Band_Limited_Functions_via_Tempered_Splines","243765042_Irregular_Sampling_and_Frames"]}
