{"id":"309148604_Coalition_structure_generation_problems_Optimization_and_parallelization_of_the_IDP_algorithm_in_multicore_systems","abstract":"The coalition structure generation problem is well known in the area of multi-agent systems. Its goal is to establish coalitions between agents while maximizing the global welfare. Among the existing different algorithms designed to solve the coalition structure generation problem, DP and IDP are the ones with smaller temporal complexity. After analyzing the operation of the dynamic programming and improved dynamic programming algorithms, we have identified which are the most frequent operations and propose an optimized method. In addition, we study and implement a method for dividing the work into different threads. To describe incremental improvements of the algorithm design, we first compare performance of an improved single central processing unit core version where we obtain speedups ranging from 7 × to 11 × . Then, we describe the best resource use in a multi-thread optimized version where we obtain an additional 7.5 × speedup running in a 12-core machine.","authors":["Francisco Cruz","Antonio Espinosa","Juan Carlos Moure","Jesús Cerquides"],"meta":["October 2016Concurrency and Computation Practice and Experience 29(5)","DOI:10.1002/cpe.3969"],"references":["313363270_A_Distributed_Algorithm_for_Anytime_Coalition_Structure_Generation","282926751_Coalition_structure_generation_A_survey","267072412_Matters_Computational_Ideas_Algorithms_Source_Code","252524827_An_Improved_Dynamic_Programming_Algorithm_for_Coalition_Structure_Generation_Short_Paper","221604737_Anytime_Optimal_Coalition_Structure_Generation","221603411_Coalition_Structure_Generation_Dynamic_Programming_Meets_Anytime_Optimisation","221454478_An_improved_dynamic_programming_algorithm_for_coalition_structure_generation","221427205_Generating_Combinations_by_Prefix_Shifts","41667162_A_Distributed_Algorithm_for_Anytime_Coalition_Structure_Generation","24048001_A_Combinatorial_Auction_Mechanism_for_Aiport_Time_Slot_Allocation","2526315_Efficiently_Enumerating_the_Subsets_of_a_Set","274171419_A_Tutorial_on_Optimization_for_Multi-Agent_Systems","267724017_On_Coalition_Formation_with_Sparse_Synergies","263040817_Coalitions_among_computationally_bounded_agents","230508650_From_the_theory_to_the_tools_Parallel_dynamic_programming","222532669_Lock-free_parallel_dynamic_programming","222490997_Coalitions_among_computationally_bounded_agents","222456762_Automated_Parallelization_of_Discrete_State-Space_Generation","222304300_Methods_for_Task_Allocation_via_Agent_Coalition_Formation","220794049_Anytime_Coalition_Structure_Generation_An_Average_Case_Study","220657080_A_Dynamic_Programming_Approach_to_the_Complete_Set_Partitioning_Problem","220111217_An_Algorithm_for_Generating_Subsets_of_Fixed_Size_With_a_Strong_Minimal_Change_Property","220080132_Anytime_coalition_structure_generation_An_average_case_study","3857070_Searching_for_optimal_coalition_structures","2432599_Searching_for_Optimal_Coalition_Structures"]}
