{"id":"320409165_Using_Tablet_Technologies_to_Engage_and_Motivate_Urban_High_School_Students","abstract":"In this two-year study, researchers examined the impact of using tablet technologies across content areas in an urban high school setting. Class observations provided notable examples of how student motivation and learning appeared to be enhanced by use of the iPads in conjunction with opportunities to collaborate and be creative in the context of their learning. Interviews from a set of teachers with a range of classroom teaching experience provided multiple perspectives of the programâ€™s impact. The opportunity for teachers and students to have the flexibility to select the apps they believe achieve curricular and/or learning goals supports the shift in educational settings to including teacher and student voice and choice for more collaborative blended learning (self-directed and self-paced) environments.","authors":["Nicol R Howard","Keith Howard"],"meta":["October 2017","Projects: Digital Equity and EdTechTablet Technologies and Motivation"],"references":["282822195_Examining_Response_to_a_One-to-One_Computer_Initiative_Student_and_Teacher_Voices","279538658_A_Quantitative_Investigation_into_the_Impacts_of_11_iPads_on_Early_Learner's_ELA_and_Math_Achievement","266475447_Do_One-to-One_Initiatives_Bridge_the_Way_to_21st_Century_Knowledge_and_Skills","258564919_Intertwining_digital_content_and_one-to-one_laptop_learning_environment","303483789_Examining_Teachers'_Use_of_iPads_Comfort_Level_Perception_and_Use","303463215_Teaching_in_a_Digital_Age_How_Educators_Use_Technology_to_Improve_Student_Learning","275710983_The_Meaning_of_Educational_Change","272532685_Acquiring_Teacher_Commitment_to_11_Initiatives_The_Role_of_the_Technology_Facilitator","260351926_Exploring_the_Use_of_the_iPad_for_Literacy_Learning","255567515_Ubiquitous_wireless_laptops_in_upper_elementary_mathematics"]}
