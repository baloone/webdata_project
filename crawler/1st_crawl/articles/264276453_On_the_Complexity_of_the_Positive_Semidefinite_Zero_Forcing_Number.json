{"id":"264276453_On_the_Complexity_of_the_Positive_Semidefinite_Zero_Forcing_Number","abstract":"The positive zero forcing number of a graph is a graph parameter that arises\nfrom a non-traditional type of graph colouring, and is related to a more\nconventional version of zero forcing. We establish a relation between the zero\nforcing and the fast-mixed searching, which implies some NP-completeness\nresults for the zero forcing problem. For chordal graphs much is understood\nregarding the relationships between positive zero forcing and clique coverings.\nBuilding upon constructions associated with optimal tree covers and forest\ncovers, we present a linear time algorithm for computing the positive zero\nforcing number of chordal graphs. We also prove that it is NP-complete to\ndetermine if a graph has a positive zero forcing set with an additional\nproperty.","authors":["Shaun M.
