{"id":"274702518_3D_Cartesian_Transport_Sweep_for_Massively_Parallel_Architectures_with_PaRSEC","abstract":"High-fidelity nuclear power plant core simulations require solving the Boltzmann transport equation. In discrete ordinates methods, the most computationally demanding oper-ation of this equation is the sweep operation. Considering the evolution of computer architectures, we propose in this paper, as a first step toward heterogeneous distributed architectures, a hybrid parallel implementation of the sweep operation on top of the generic task-based runtime system: PARSEC. Such an implementation targets three nested levels of parallelism: mes-sage passing, multi-threading, and vectorization. A theoretical performance model was designed to validate the approach and help the tuning of the multiple parameters involved in such an approach. The proposed parallel implementation of the Sweep achieves a sustained performance of 6.1 Tflop/s, corresponding to 33.9% of the peak performance of the targeted supercom-puter. This implementation compares favorably with state-of-art solvers such as PARTISN; and it can therefore serve as a building block for a massively parallel version of the neutron transport solver DOMINO developed at EDF.","authors":["salli Moustafa","mathieu faverge","Laurent Plagne","Pierre Ramet"],"meta":["May 2015","DOI:10.1109/IPDPS.2015.75","Conference: 29th IEEE International Parallel & Distributed Processing SymposiumAt: Hyderabad, India."],"references":["294583154_Applications_tools_and_techniques_on_the_road_to_exascale_computing","263043331_Shared_Memory_Parallelism_for_3D_Cartesian_Discrete_Ordinates_Solver","261357060_Exploring_Traditional_and_Emerging_Parallel_Programming_Models_Using_a_Proxy_Application","255142567_Parallel_Ssub_n_Sweeps_on_Unstructured_Grids_Algorithms_for_Prioritization_Grid_Partitioning_and_Cycle_Detection","320672731_Shared_Memory_Parallelism_for_3D_Cartesian_Discrete_Ordinates_Solver","303673325_Concurrent_Collections_Programming_Model","282991758_3D_Neutron_Transport_and_HPC_A_PWR_Full_Core_Calculation_Using_PENTRAN_Sn_Code_and_IBM_BLUEGENEP_Computers","279602533_Parallel_S_n_sweeps_on_unstructured_grids_Algorithms_for_prioritization_grid_partitioning_and_cycle_detection","264885526_Massively_Parallel_Three-Dimensional_Transport_Solutions_for_the_k-Eigenvalue_Problem","245366051_An_Sn_Algorithm_for_the_Massively_Parallel_CM-200_Computer"]}
