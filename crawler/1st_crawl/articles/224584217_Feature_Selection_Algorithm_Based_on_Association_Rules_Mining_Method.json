{"id":"224584217_Feature_Selection_Algorithm_Based_on_Association_Rules_Mining_Method","abstract":"This paper presents a novel feature selection algorithm based on the technique of mining association rules. The main idea of the proposed algorithm is to find the features that are closely correlative with the class attribute by association rules mining method. Experimental results on several real and artificial data sets demonstrate that the proposed feature selection algorithm is able to obtain a smaller and satisfactory feature subset when compared with other existing feature selection algorithms. It is a new feature selection algorithm with vast of application prospect and research value.","authors":["Jianwen Xie","Jianhua Wu","Qingquan Qian"],"meta":["July 2009","DOI:10.1109/ICIS.2009.103","SourceIEEE Xplore","Conference: Computer and Information Science, 2009.
