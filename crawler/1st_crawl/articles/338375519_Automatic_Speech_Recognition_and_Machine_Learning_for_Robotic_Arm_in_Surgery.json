{"id":"338375519_Automatic_Speech_Recognition_and_Machine_Learning_for_Robotic_Arm_in_Surgery","abstract":"This article liberalize the current machine learning rehearses as utilized in the emerging edge and as noteworthy to speech recognition approaches on present-day surgical robots. The desire is to advance the development of medical robots among the machine learning and speech recognition liberal that has spread out from the point of view of health care services in social protection. The propelled subordinates are sifted through the central machine learning models that are pattern setting and have a show for center and progress that are steady to robotic arm and speech recognition practices. Machine learning is displayed in the comprehension of speech recognition components and its influence in biomedical robots for surgeries. Topical advances of machine learning and intelligent algorithms, further accentuations on their vast hugeness in the improvement of speech recognition in medical surgical applications. 2.","authors":["J.
