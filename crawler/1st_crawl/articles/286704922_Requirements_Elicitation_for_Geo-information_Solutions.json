{"id":"286704922_Requirements_Elicitation_for_Geo-information_Solutions","abstract":"Geo-information solutions can achieve a higher level of quality if they are developed in accordance with a user-centred design that requires definition of the user requirements in the first step of solution construction. We treat a geo-information solution as a system designed to support human-based activities in a specific context through which solutions to contextual problems can be achieved via geographic knowledge. Geographic knowledge is a result of geo-data exploration, analysis, interpretation and dissemination with a given geo-information system. Taking the characteristics of geo-information systems into account, existing methods and techniques of requirements engineering may be applied for the design and implementation of geo-information solutions. Based on these considerations, here we present a generic framework that can aid geo-information experts, geo-informaticians and cartographers in the design and construction of more efficient, effective and satisfactory solutions.","authors":["Claudia Robbi Sluter","Corn√© Van Elzakker","Ivana Ivanova"],"meta":["May 2014Cartographic Journal The 54(1):1743277414Y.000","DOI:10.1179/1743277414Y.0000000092"],"references":["321523108_User-Centred_Requirements_Engineering","275969106_Defining_standard_symbols_for_street_network_maps_for_urban_planning_based_on_user_requirements","238350661_The_role_of_quality_information_in_the_long-term_functioning_of_a_Geographic_Information_System","233666686_ICA_Research_Agenda_on_Cartography_and_GI_Science","233572940_Revisiting_Web_Cartography_in_the_United_States_the_Rise_of_User-Centered_Design","228720566_COLLABORATIVE_MAPPING_AND_SPATIO-TEMPORAL_DATA_DISSEMINATION_THROUGH_A_WEB-BASED_VIRTUAL_GLOBE_APPLICATION","228655983_User_Assessment_for_Developing_Optimal_Cartographic_Representation_Models_within_an_Australian_Mobile_Location-Based_Services_Travel_Application","226471156_User-Centered_Design_Approaches_for_Web_Mapping_Applications_A_Case_Study_with_USGS_Hydrological_Data_in_the_United_States","221612082_RIMapperWMS_A_web_map_service_providing_SVG_maps_with_a_built-in_client","27686017_The_use_of_maps_in_the_exploration_of_geographic_data","3247691_Reference_model_for_requirements_and_specifications","307855268_Web_Cartography_developments_and_prospects","292795039_Managing_the_development_of_large_software_systems_Dr_Winston_W_Rovce_introduction","284311665_Principles_of_Geographical_Information_Systems","260908490_Computer_Graphics_Principles_and_Practice_in_C","250196141_Part_2_Issues_and_Problems_Relating_to_Cartographic_Data_Use_Exchange_and_Transfer_The_Role_Of_Quality_Information_In_The_Long-Term_Functioning_Of_A_Geographic_Information_System","246773439_Writing_Effective_Use_Cases","245588543_Book_Requirements_Engineering_Processes_and_Techniques","243775347_An_Introduction_to_Requirements_Engineering","242813839_Object-oriented_analysis_and_design","242522319_Software_engineering_concepts_and_techniques","239065262_Qualitative_Methods_for_Research_on_Mapmaking_and_Map_Use","238726671_Basic_use-case_modeling","234797700_UML_2_and_the_Unified_Process_Practical_Object-Oriented_Analysis_and_Design","232541286_A_comparison_of_two_group_brainstorming_procedures","232435606_Effect_of_Brain-storming_Instruction_on_Creative_Problem_Solving_by_Trained_and_Untrained_Subjects","229740157_Single_user_Environments_Desktop_to_Mobile","229705360_Web-Mapping_Applications_and_HCI_Considerations_for_their_Design","224186356_Rethinking_Map_Legends_with_Visualization","224001131_Object_Oriented_Analysis_Design_with_Application","220691810_Object-Oriented_Software_Engineering_-_A_Use-Case_Driven_Approach","220071439_Structure_Analysis_for_Requirements_Definition","220059361_Informal_description_and_analysis_of_geographic_requirements_An_approach_based_on_problems","213881465_Managing_the_Development_of_Large_Software_Systems","31739946_Use_Case_Modeling_K_Bittner_I_Spence_prol_de_I_Jacobson","30868933_Object_Oriented_Analysis","17394921_Effect_of_perceived_expertness_upon_creativity_of_members_of_brainstorming_groups","3186975_User_Validation_of_Information_System_Requirements_Some_Empirical_Results"]}
