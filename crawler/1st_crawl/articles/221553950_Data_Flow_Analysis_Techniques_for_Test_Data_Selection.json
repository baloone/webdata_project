{"id":"221553950_Data_Flow_Analysis_Techniques_for_Test_Data_Selection","abstract":"This paper examines a family of program test data selection criteria derived from data flow analysis techniques similar to those used in compiler optimization. It is argued that currently used path selection criteria which examine only the control flow of a program are inadequate. Our procedure associates with each point in a program at which a variable is defined, those points at which the value is used. Several related path criteria, which differ in the number of these associations needed to adequately test the program, are defined and compared.","authors":["Sandra Rapps","Elaine J.
