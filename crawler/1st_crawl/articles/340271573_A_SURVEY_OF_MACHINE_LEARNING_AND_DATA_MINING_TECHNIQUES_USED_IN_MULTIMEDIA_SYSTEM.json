{"id":"340271573_A_SURVEY_OF_MACHINE_LEARNING_AND_DATA_MINING_TECHNIQUES_USED_IN_MULTIMEDIA_SYSTEM","abstract":"Machine learning and data mining are research areas of computer science whose quick development is due to the advances in data analysis research, growth in the database industry and the resulting market needs for methods that are capable of extracting valuable knowledge from large data stores. A vast amount of research work has been done in the multimedia area, targeting different aspects of data analytics, such as the capture, storage, indexing, mining, and retrieval of multimedia big data. However, very few research work provides a complete survey of the whole pine-line of the methods used in machine learning and data mining in the research problems. In this survey paper, we conduct a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art methods, algorithms machine learning and data mining in multimedia systems.","authors":["Hieu Tran"],"meta":["September 2019"],"references":["352362538_An_Analytical_Approach_for_Mining_Audio_Signals","335428757_Recovering_Variable_Names_for_Minified_Code_with_Usage_Contexts","335425147_Graph-Based_Mining_of_In-the-Wild_Fine-Grained_Semantic_Code_Change_Patterns","318316000_Text_Summarization_Techniques_A_Brief_Survey","345002397_Multimedia_Data_Mining_Concept","339502750_Information_Extraction","339502749_Opinion_Mining_and_Sentiment_Analysis","335495699_Does_BLEU_Score_Work_for_Code_Migration","324500987_A_Survey_Data_Mining_Techniques_for_Social_Media_Analysis","316600283_Data_Mining_Concepts_and_Techniques"]}
