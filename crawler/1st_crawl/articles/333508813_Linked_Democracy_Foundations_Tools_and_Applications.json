This model of democracy for the web of data brings new challenges for the social organisation of knowledge, collective innovation, and the coordination of actions. Licensed linked data, licensed linguistic linked data, right expression languages, semantic web regulatory models, electronic institutions, artificial socio-cognitive systems are examples of regulatory and institutional design (regulations by design).","authors":["Marta Poblet","Pompeu Casanovas","Víctor Rodríguez-Doncel"],"meta":["May 2019","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-13363-4","Publisher: SpringerISBN: 978-3-030-13363-4","Project: Linked Democracy: Artificial Intelligence for Democratic Innovation"],"references":["326104536_Compliance_with_International_Soft_Law_Is_the_Adoption_of_Soft_Law_Predictable","324664886_A_Linked_Democracy_Approach_for_Regulating_Public_Health_Data","323209648_Progress_toward_national_estimates_of_police_use_of_force","321905323_Are_We_Done_with_Business_Process_Compliance_State-of-the-Art_and_Challenges_Ahead","327178775_Law's_Wars_The_Fate_of_the_Rule_of_Law_in_the_US_'War_on_Terror'","325917845_Systematic_review_of_big_data_analytics_in_governance","325833485_A_literature_review_on_the_key_technologies_of_processing_big_data","324629520_Re-coding_Black_Mirror_Chairs'_Welcome_Organization","324425365_The_Sciences_of_the_Artificial","323151641_Ethics_in_artificial_intelligence_introduction_to_the_special_issue","321020031_A_Knowledge_Organization_System_for_e-Participation_in_Law-Making","320333287_Workflow-centric_research_objects_First_class_citizens_in_scholarly_discourse","321496622_Interrogating_privacy_in_a_world_brimming_with_high_political_entanglements_surveillance_interdependence_interconnections","320597170_Agreement_and_relational_justice_A_perspective_from_philosophy_and_sociology_of_law","316328181_Introduction_Electoral_Change_in_Twenty-First_Century_Ireland"]}
