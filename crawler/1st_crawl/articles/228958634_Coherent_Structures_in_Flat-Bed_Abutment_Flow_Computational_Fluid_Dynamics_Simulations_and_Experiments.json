{"id":"228958634_Coherent_Structures_in_Flat-Bed_Abutment_Flow_Computational_Fluid_Dynamics_Simulations_and_Experiments","abstract":"Numerical computations and laboratory experiments are carried out to investigate the three-dimensional structure of large-scale coherent vortices induced by bridge abutments on a flat bed. A finite-volume numerical method is developed for solving the unsteady, three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations, closed with the k – turbulence model, in generalized curvi-linear coordinates and applied to study the flow in the vicinity of a typical abutment geometry with a fixed, flat bed. The computed flowfields reveal the presence of multiple, large-scale, unsteady vortices both in the upstream, ''quiescent,'' region of recirculating fluid and the shear-layer emanating from the edge of the foundation. These computational findings motivated the development of a novel experimental technique for visualizing the footprints of large-scale coherent structures at the free surface. The technique relies on digital photography and employs averaging of instantaneous images over finite-size windows to extract coherent eddies from the chaotic turbulent flow. Application of this technique to several abutment configurations yielded results that support the numerical findings.","authors":["Antonis Chrisohoides","M Asce","Fotis Sotiropoulos","Terry W.
