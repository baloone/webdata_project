{"id":"273005388_DAWN_Delay-Aware_Wi-Fi_offloading_and_network_selection","abstract":"To accommodate the explosive growth in mobile data traffic, both mobile\ncellular operators and mobile users are increasingly interested in offloading\nthe traffic from cellular networks to Wi-Fi networks. However, previously\nproposed offloading schemes mainly focus on reducing the cellular data usage,\nwithout paying too much attention on the quality of service (QoS) requirements\nof the applications. In this paper, we study the Wi-Fi offloading problem with\ndelay-tolerant applications under usage-based pricing. We aim to achieve a good\ntradeoff between the user's payment and its QoS characterized by the file\ntransfer deadline. We first propose a general Delay-Aware Wi-Fi Offloading and\nNetwork Selection (DAWN) algorithm for a general single-user decision scenario.\nWe then analytically establish the sufficient conditions, under which the\noptimal policy exhibits a threshold structure in terms of both the time and\nfile size. As a result, we propose a monotone DAWN algorithm that approximately\nsolves the general offloading problem, and has a much lower computational\ncomplexity comparing to the optimal algorithm. Simulation results show that\nboth the general and monotone DAWN schemes achieve a high probability of\ncompleting file transfer under a stringent deadline, and require the lowest\npayment under a non-stringent deadline as compared with three heuristic\nschemes.","authors":["Man Hon Cheung","Jianwei Huang"],"meta":["February 2015IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications 33(6)","DOI:10.1109/JSAC.2015.2416989","SourcearXiv"],"references":["308548419_Next_place_prediction_using_mobility_markov_chains","262641258_Bargaining-Based_Mobile_Data_Offloading","244213963_When_Cellular_Meets_WiFi_in_Wireless_Small_Cell_Networks","234720429_Next_Place_Prediction_using_Mobility_Markov_Chains","230996474_Offering_Supplementary_Network_Technologies_Adoption_Behavior_and_Offloading_Benefits","230569465_Economics_of_WiFi_Offloading_Trading_Delay_for_Cellular_Capacity","224773123_Dynamic_Programming_and_Optimal_Control","224229869_On_the_Levy-Walk_Nature_of_Human_Mobility","221164186_Mobile_Data_Offloading_How_Much_Can_WiFi_Deliver","220747372_Cellular_Traffic_Offloading_through_WiFi_Networks","220747276_Energy_Efficient_Offloading_of_3G_Networks","319477638_Offering_supplementary_network_technologies_Adoption_behavior_and_offloading_benefits","313629843_Cisco_Visual_Networking_Index_Global_Mobile_Data_Traffic_Forecast_Update_2014-2019","270775547_A_Double-Auction_Mechanism_for_Mobile_Data-Offloading_Markets","269307716_Congestion-aware_network_selection_and_data_offloading","262411989_When_the_price_is_right_Enabling_time-dependent_pricing_of_broadband_data","261420842_An_iterative_double_auction_for_mobile_data_offloading","261420677_Optimal_delayed_Wi-Fi_offloading","261155256_Economics_of_mobile_data_offloading","261084298_AMUSE_Empowering_Users_for_Cost-Aware_Offloading_with_Throughput-Delay_Tradeoffs","230887855_Markov_Decision_Processes_Discrete_Stochastic_Dynamic_Programming","224183987_Exploiting_Mobility_Diversity_in_Sharing_Wireless_Access_A_Game_Theoretic_Approach","221234427_Augmenting_mobile_3G_using_WiFi","220977978_Win-Coupon_An_incentive_framework_for_3G_traffic_offloading","220926441_BreadCrumbs_Forecasting_mobile_connectivity","220750424_A_practical_scan_re-use_scheme_for_system_test","220088806_Optimality_of_Threshold_Policies_for_Transmission_Scheduling_in_Correlated_Fading_Channels"]}
