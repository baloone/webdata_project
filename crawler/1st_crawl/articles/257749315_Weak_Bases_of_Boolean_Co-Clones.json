{"id":"257749315_Weak_Bases_of_Boolean_Co-Clones","abstract":"Universal algebra and clone theory have proven to be a useful tool in the\nstudy of constraint satisfaction problems since the complexity, up to logspace\nreductions, is determined by the set of polymorphisms of the constraint\nlanguage. For classifications where primitive positive definitions are\nunsuitable, such as size-preserving reductions, weaker closure operations may\nbe necessary. In this article we consider strong partial clones which can be\nseen as a more fine-grained framework than Post's lattice where each clone\nsplits into an interval of strong partial clones. We investigate these\nintervals and give simple relational descriptions, weak bases, of the largest\nelements. The weak bases have a highly regular form and are in many cases\neasily relatable to the smallest members in the intervals, which suggests that\nthe lattice of strong partial clones is considerably simpler than the full\nlattice of partial clones.","authors":["Victor Lagerkvist"],"meta":["October 2013Information Processing Letters 114(9)","DOI:10.1016/j.ipl.2014.03.011","SourcearXiv"],"references":["281090375_Complexity_of_SAT_Problems_Clone_Theory_and_the_Exponential_Time_Hypothesis","242206661_Playing_with_Boolean_Blocks_Part_I_Post's_Lattice_with_Applications_to_Complexity_Theory1","266917295_Function_algebras_on_finite_sets_A_basic_course_on_many-valued_logic_and_clone_theory","266271441_The_Weak_Base_Method_for_Constraint_Satisfaction","250969140_On_some_closed_classes_in_partial_two-valued_logic","239338339_The_algebras_of_partial_functions_and_their_invariants","235625105_The_Two-Valued_Iterative_Systems_of_Mathematical_Logic","223830765_Structure_Identification_of_Boolean_Relations_and_Plain_Bases_for_co-Clones","222813521_Bases_for_Boolean_co-clones","222500650_On_the_algebraic_structure_of_combinatorial_problems"]}
