{"id":"221551148_Teaching_Semantics_with_a_Proof_Assistant_No_More_LSD_Trip_Proofs","abstract":"We describe a course on the semantics of a simple imperative programming language and on applications to compilers, type systems, static analyses and Hoare logic. The course is entirely based on the proof assistant Isabelle and includes a compact introduction to Isabelle. The overall aim is to teach the students how to write correct and readable proofs.","authors":["Tobias Nipkow"],"meta":["January 2012","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-27940-9_3","SourceDBLP","Conference: Verification, Model Checking, and Abstract Interpretation - 13th International Conference, VMCAI 2012, Philadelphia, PA, USA, January 22-24, 2012.
