{"id":"288856014_A_Hybrid_Evolutionary_Immune_Algorithm_for_Multiobjective_Optimization_Problems","abstract":"In recent years, multiobjective immune algorithms (MOIAs) have shown promising performance in solving multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs). However, basic MOIAs only use a single hypermutation operation to evolve individuals, which may induce some difficulties in tackling complicated MOPs. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid evolutionary framework for MOIAs, in which the cloned individuals are divided into several subpopulations and then evolved using different evolutionary strategies. An example of this hybrid framework is implemented, in which simulated binary crossover and differential evolution with polynomial mutation are adopted. A fine-grained selection mechanism and a novel elitism sharing strategy are also adopted for performance enhancement. Various comparative experiments are conducted on 28 test MOPs and our empirical results validate the effectiveness and competitiveness of our proposed algorithm in solving MOPs of different types.","authors":["Qiuzhen Lin","Jianyong Chen","Zhi-Hui Zhan","Wei-neng Chen"],"meta":["January 2015IEEE transactions on neural networks / a publication of the IEEE Neural Networks Council
