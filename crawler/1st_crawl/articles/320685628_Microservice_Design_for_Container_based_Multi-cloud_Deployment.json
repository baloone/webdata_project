{"id":"320685628_Microservice_Design_for_Container_based_Multi-cloud_Deployment","abstract":"Micro services are increasingly getting popular in today's world as it provides flexibility for the developers and Architects to build an application for distributed environments. Microservice design has its own advantages and challenges and has a definite need to bring some standardization in design. Design patterns, in general, help developers to adopt this stands and enable them to bring some uniformity in their application design. Design patterns are traditionally used to bring standardization in the development process and follow best practices to avoid redundancy, improve productivity and minimize errors in the development process and help developers to create quality applications to bring uniformity across various system developments. We attempted to bring standardization in microservices design and build application for distributed systems to collaborate and scale efficiently and address the business needs. We would like to understand and analyze these design patterns for microservices and how it helps in modern deployment needs on multi cloud environments and its challenges.","authors":["Baskaran Jambunathan","Kalpana Y."],"meta":["February 2016","Project: cloud computing"],"references":["343851229_Auto-Scaling_of_Micro-Services_Using_Containerization","286012873_Microservices_Validation_Methodology_and_Implementation","277760804_Designing_a_Smart_City_Internet_of_Things_Platform_with_Microservice_Architecture","268919364_Micro-service_Architecture_for_Emerging_Telecom_Applications","320685545_Multi_Cloud_Deployment_with_Containers"]}
