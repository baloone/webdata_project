{"id":"277722473_A_Cellular_Automaton_for_Blocking_Queen_Games","abstract":"We show that the winning positions of a certain type of two-player game form\ninteresting patterns which often defy analysis, yet can be computed by a\ncellular automaton. The game, known as {\\em Blocking Wythoff Nim}, consists of\nmoving a queen as in chess, but always towards (0,0), and it may not be moved\nto any of $k-1$ temporarily \"blocked\" positions specified on the previous turn\nby the other player. The game ends when a player wins by blocking all possible\nmoves of the other player. The value of $k$ is a parameter that defines the\ngame, and the pattern of winning positions can be very sensitive to $k$. As $k$\nbecomes large, parts of the pattern of winning positions converge to recurring\nchaotic patterns that are independent of $k$. The patterns for large $k$\ndisplay an unprecedented amount of self-organization at many scales, and here\nwe attempt to describe the self-organized structure that appears.","authors":["Matthew Cook","Urban Larsson","Turlough Neary"],"meta":["June 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-3-662-47221-7_6","SourcearXiv","Conference: International Workshop on Cellular Automata and Discrete Complex Systems"],"references":["233736011_A_Simple_FSM-Based_Proof_of_the_Additive_Periodicity_of_the_Sprague-Grundy_Function_of_Wythoff_'s_Game","228926343_Permutations_of_the_natural_numbers_with_prescribed_difference_multisets","228611932_Complyconstrain_games_or_games_with_a_Muller_twist","221661707_From_Heaps_of_Matches_to_the_Limits_of_Computability","51978507_Impartial_games_emulating_one-dimensional_cellular_automata_andundecidability","266223725_A_modification_of_the_game_of_Nim","257000708_Further_generalizations_of_the_Wythoff_game_and_the_minimum_excludant","228691438_Nim_with_a_Modular_Muller_Twist","220075278_Complementing_and_Exactly_Covering_Sequences","51910734_Lattice_games_without_rational_strategies"]}
