{"id":"326024903_Keypoint_Transfer_for_Fast_Whole-Body_Segmentation","abstract":"We introduce an approach for image segmentation based on sparse correspondences between keypoints in testing and training images. Keypoints represent automatically identified distinctive image locations, where each keypoint correspondence suggests a transformation between images. We use these correspondences to transfer label maps of entire organs from the training images to the test image. The keypoint transfer algorithm includes three steps: (i) keypoint matching, (ii) voting-based keypoint labeling, and (iii) keypoint-based probabilistic transfer of organ segmentations. We report segmentation results for abdominal organs in whole-body CT and MRI, as well as in contrast-enhanced CT and MRI. Our method offers a speed-up of about three orders of magnitude in comparison to common multi-atlas segmentation, while achieving an accuracy that compares favorably. Moreover, keypoint transfer does not require the registration to an atlas or a training phase. Finally, the method allows for the segmentation of scans with highly variable field-of-view.","authors":["Christian Wachinger","Matthew Toews","Georg Langs","William Wells"],"meta":["June 2018IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TMI.2018.2851194"],"references":["279866883_Keypoint_Transfer_Segmentation","278039971_Contour-Driven_Atlas-Based_Segmentation","265377531_Hierarchical_multi-structure_segmentation_guided_by_anatomical_correlations","258191431_VISCERAL_Towards_Large_Data_in_Medical_Imaging_-_Challenges_and_Directions","51494989_Entangled_Decision_Forests_and_Their_Application_for_Semantic_Segmentation_of_CT_Images","51494976_A_Combining_Generative_and_Discriminative_Models_for_Semantic_Segmentation_of_CT_Scans_via_Active_Learning","51159484_A_Supervised_Patch-Based_Approach_for_Human_Brain_Labeling","45406188_Label_Fusion_in_Atlas-Based_Segmentation_Using_a_Selective_and_Iterative_Method_for_Performance_Level_Estimation_SIMPLE","44686671_A_Generative_Model_for_Image_Segmentation_Based_on_Label_Fusion","26754826_Marginal_Space_Learning_for_Efficient_Detection_of_2D3D_Anatomical_Structures_in_Medical_Images","312742613_Automatic_3D_Multiorgan_Segmentation_via_Clustering_and_Graph_Cut_Using_Spatial_Relations_and_Hierarchically-Registered_Atlases","308520133_Efficient_Descriptor-Based_Segmentation_of_Parotid_Glands_with_Non-Local_Means","303890490_Cloud-Based_Evaluation_of_Anatomical_Structure_Segmentation_and_Landmark_Detection_Algorithms_VISCERAL_Anatomy_Benchmarks","289490514_Segmentation_and_landmark_localization_based_on_multiple_atlases","283159957_Multi-atlas_Segmentation_and_Landmark_Localization_in_Images_with_Large_Field_of_View","282930644_Multi-modal_multi-atlas_segmentation_using_discrete_optimisation_and_self-similarities","280587182_A_Feature-Based_Approach_to_Big_Data_Analysis_of_Medical_Images","261253746_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","261222593_Learning_New_Parts_for_Landmark_Localization_in_Whole-Body_CT_Scans","237001867_Neighborhood_approximation_using_randomized_forests","233983278_Efficient_and_Robust_Model-to-Image_Alignment_using_3D_Scale-Invariant_Features","222442253_Generalizing_the_Hough_Transform_to_Detect_Arbitrary_Shapes","222415198_Feature-Based_Morphometry_Discovering_Group-related_Anatomical_Patterns","215458581_Random_Sample_Consensus_A_Paradigm_for_Model_Fitting_with_Applications_To_Image_Analysis_and_Automated_Cartography","200038910_Distinctive_Image_Features_from_Scale-Invariant_Keypoints","51653030_3D_automatic_anatomy_segmentation_based_on_iterative_graph-cut-ASM","46305426_Patch-based_segmentation_using_expert_priors_Application_to_hippocampus_and_ventricle_segmentation","8649539_Evaluation_of_Atlas_Selection_Strategies_for_Atlas-Based_Image_Segmentation_with_Application_to_Confocal_Microscopy_Images_of_Bee_Brains","6924665_Automatic_anatomical_brain_MRI_segmentation_combining_label_propagation_and_decision_fusion","6451825_A_Review_of_Methods_for_Correction_of_Intensity_Inhomogeneity_in_MRI","6179020_Symmetric_Diffeomorphic_Image_Registration_with_Cross-Correlation_Evaluating_Automated_Labeling_of_Elderly_and_Neurodegenerative_Brain"]}
