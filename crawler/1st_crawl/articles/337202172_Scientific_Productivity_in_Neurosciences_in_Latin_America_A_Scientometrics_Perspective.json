{"id":"337202172_Scientific_Productivity_in_Neurosciences_in_Latin_America_A_Scientometrics_Perspective","abstract":"Background: Neurosciences research has increased significantly in recent years around the world. It has led to the development of interdisciplinary work, moving from activities from isolated fields (such as biology, psychology or neurology) to research that involves different scientific perspectives. In developing regions, such as Latin America, it has additional challenges, related to available funding and infrastructure.\nAim: To analyze key factors in scientific productivity in neurosciences in Latin America.\nMethods: A bibliometric analysis of the scientific productivity in neurosciences in main five Latin American countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Mexico) was carried out.\nResults: Brazil was the largest producer of scientific articles, and receptor of citations, in neurosciences in 1998-2017, followed by Mexico. We identified highly cited papers, top institutions, networks of authors, main journals and key areas in neurosciences for this period in the 5 countries.\nConclusions: Scientific productivity in neurosciences in Latin America would benefit from the consolidation of more regional, interdisciplinary and international research networks. In this work, we discuss key elements for the consolidation of neurosciences research in Latin America.","authors":["Diego Forero","Martha L. Trujillo","Yeimy Gonz√°lez Giraldo","George E.
