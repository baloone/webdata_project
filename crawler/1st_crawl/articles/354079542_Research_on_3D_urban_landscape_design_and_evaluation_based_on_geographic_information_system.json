{"id":"354079542_Research_on_3D_urban_landscape_design_and_evaluation_based_on_geographic_information_system","abstract":"Virtual city is the frontier field of 3D city geographic information system research. For this reason, first, how to build a city 3D landscape is discussed and researched. At the same time, it outlines the development situation and basic principles of city 3D simulation and then analyzes the establishment of 3D city. There are two methods of landscape which focuses on the realization methods of 3D scene modeling, dynamic simulation and real-time driving, then presents the role, significance and development prospects of the dynamic simulation technology of urban 3D landscape and summarizes the 3D simulation besides real-time driving of the city. GIS combined with the application possibilities and development direction produced an application example of urban 3D landscape dynamic simulation. From the perspective of comprehensive quantitative evaluation of landscape vision, a comprehensive evaluation metric system based on basic visual elements and landscape vision sensitivity is designed, and a comprehensive evaluation method of landscape vision based on GIS spatial analysis and fuzzy analytic hierarchy process is proposed. From both an overall and a single-factor perspective, this research objectively exposes the distribution characteristics of landscape visual resources and their affecting elements. The comparison with the urban landscape evaluation results based on user scores verifies the reliability and advancement of this method, which is a quantitative description and evaluation of the landscape. Visual resources provide a new research idea and research method and also provide an objective reference and decision support for the comprehensive development planning of scenic spots and the development and protection of urban landscapes.","authors":["Pengyu Shan","Wan Sun"],"meta":["September 2021Environmental Earth Sciences 80(17)","DOI:10.1007/s12665-021-09886-y"],"references":["349425737_Urban_Landscape_Ecological_Design_and_Stereo_Vision_Based_on_3D_Mesh_Simplification_Algorithm_and_Artificial_Intelligence","349176406_Measuring_Walkability_with_GIS-Methods_Overview_and_New_Approach_Proposal","348574447_A_new_GIS-compatible_methodology_for_visibility_analysis_in_digital_surface_models_of_earth_sites","343661301_Three-Dimensional_Visualized_Urban_Landscape_Planning_and_Design_Based_on_Virtual_Reality_Technology","347665676_A_3D_spatiotemporal_morphological_database_for_urban_green_infrastructure_and_its_applications","347333743_Spatial_multi-criteria_evaluation_in_3D_context_suitability_analysis_of_urban_vertical_development","346875075_Research_on_3D_data_modeling_of_virtual_city_environment_based_on_GIS","346346883_Environmental_planning_based_on_reduce_reuse_recycle_and_recover_using_artificial_intelligence","345641708_On_the_suitability_of_a_unified_GIS-BIM-HBIM_framework_for_cataloguing_and_assessing_vulnerability_in_Historic_Urban_Landscapes_a_critical_review","343201969_An_integrated_3D_GIS-based_method_for_estimating_the_urban_potential_of_BIPV_retrofit_of_facades","341217441_Evaluation_of_Urban_Landscape_Outdoor_Advertisement_Signboards_Using_Virtual_Reality","339348549_HBIM-GIS_Integration_From_IFC_to_CityGML_Standard_for_Damaged_Cultural_Heritage_in_a_Multiscale_3D_GIS","333824130_Enhancing_Sustainable_Development_through_Web_Based_3D_Smart_City_Model_Using_GIS_and_BIM_Case_Study_Sheikh_Hamad_City","333506007_Multidimensional_Web_GIS_Approach_for_Citizen_Participation_on_Urban_Evolution","342552418_Development_and_validation_in_a_2D-GIS_environment_of_a_3D_shadow_cast_vector-based_model_on_arbitrarily_orientated_and_tilted_surfaces"]}
