{"id":"341447172_Design_of_Thermal_Systems_Using_Topology_Optimization","abstract":"The goal of this thesis is to apply topology optimization to the design of different thermal systems such as heat sinks and heat exchangers in order to improve the thermal performance of these systems compared to conventional designs. The design of thermal systems is a complex task that has traditionally relied on experience, intuition, and trial and error approaches. Topology optimization, in contrast, allows for a systematic optimization of such systems and the identification of unintuitive and unexpected geometries. Both numerical optimizations and, to a lesser extent, experimental validations of optimized designs are presented within this thesis. The main contribution of the thesis is the development of several numerical optimization models that are applied to different design challenges within thermal engineering.","authors":["Jan H. K.
