{"id":"320804062_Cloud_Computing_Empirical_Studies_in_Higher_Education_A_Literature_Review","abstract":"The advent of cloud computing (CC) in recent\nyears has attracted substantial interest from various institutions,\nespecially higher education institutions, which wish to consider\nthe advantages of its features. Many universities have migrated\nfrom traditional forms of teaching to electronic learning services,\nand they rely upon information and communication technology\nservices. The usage of CC in educational environments provides\nmany benefits, such as low-cost services for academics and\nstudents. The expanded use of CC comes with significant\nadoption challenges. Understanding the position of higher\neducation institutions with respect to CC adoption is an essential\nresearch area. This paper investigated the current state of CC\nadoption in the higher education sector in order to enrich the\nresearch in this area of interest. Existing limitations and\nknowledge gaps in current empirical studies are identified.\nMoreover, suggested areas for further researches will be\nhighlighted for the benefit of other researchers who are\ninteresting in this topic. These researches encourage institutions\nof education especially in higher education to adopted cloud\ncomputing technology.","authors":["Abusfian Elgelany","Weam Gaoud Alghabban"],"meta":["January 2017International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications 8(10)","DOI:10.14569/IJACSA.2017.081017"],"references":["346629486_Major_Differences_of_Cloud_Computing_Adoption_in_Universities_Europe_vs_the_Middle_East","317366370_The_Integrated_Framework_of_Cloud_Computing_Implementation_in_Higher_Education_Institution_A_Review_of_Literature","311315728_Assessment_of_cloud-based_Computational_Environments_for_higher_education","311252840_What_should_be_done_to_achieve_greater_use_of_cloud_computing_by_higher_education_institutions","312361365_Antecedents_and_consequences_of_cloud_computing_adoption_in_education_to_achieve_knowledge_management","312080293_Student_Perceptions_of_Cloud_Applications_Effectiveness_in_Higher_Education","310049908_Private_Cloud_with_e-Learning_for_Resources_Sharing_in_University_Environment","309918430_Cloud-based_Virtual_Computing_Labs_for_HEIs","309467518_An_exploratory_study_for_investigating_the_critical_success_factors_for_cloud_migration_in_the_Saudi_Arabian_higher_education_context","308817884_An_architecture_for_Cloud_computing_in_Higher_Education"]}
