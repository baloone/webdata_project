The aim of this study is to delineate the associations between DAPS and psychosis, hostility, excitation, and mannerism (PHEM) symptoms, cognitive tests as measured using the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimerâ€™s Disease (CERAD) and IgA/IgM responses to TRYCATs. We included 40 healthy controls and 80 participants with schizophrenia. Depression and anxiety symptoms were measured with The Hamilton Depression (HAM-D) and Anxiety (HAM-A) Rating Scales, respectively. Physiosomatic symptoms were assessed with the Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Rating Scale (FF). Negative symptoms as well as CERAD tests, including Verbal Fluency Test (VFT), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Word List Memory (WLM), and WL Delayed Recall were measured, while ratios of IgA responses to noxious/protective TRYCATs (IgA NOX_PRO) were computed. Schizophrenia symptoms consisted of two dimensions, a first comprising PHEM and negative symptoms, and a second DAPS symptoms. A large part of the variance in DAPS was explained by psychotic symptoms and WLM. Of the variance in HAM-D, 58.9% was explained by the regression on excitement, IgA NOX_PRO ratio, WLM, and VFT; 29.9% of the variance in HAM-A by psychotic symptoms and IgA NOX/PRO; and 45.5% of the variance in FF score by psychotic symptoms, IgA NOX/PRO, and WLM. Neural network modeling shows that PHEM, IgA NOX_PRO, WLM, and MMSE are the dominant variables predicting DAPS. DAPS appear to be driven by PHEM and negative symptoms coupled with impairments in episodic memory, especially false memory creation, while all symptom dimension and cognitive impairments may be driven by an increased production of noxious TRYCATs, including picolinic, quinolinic, and xanthurenic acid.","authors":["Buranee Kanchanatawan","Supaksorn Thika","Sunee Sirivichayakul","Andre F Carvalho"],"meta":["April 2018Neurotoxicity Research 33(1)","DOI:10.1007/s12640-018-9868-4"],"references":["319483208_Changes_in_Tryptophan_Catabolite_TRYCAT_Pathway_Patterning_Are_Associated_with_Mild_Impairments_in_Declarative_Memory_in_Schizophrenia_and_Deficits_in_Semantic_and_Episodic_Memory_Coupled_with_Increas","311425400_Physio-somatic_symptoms_in_schizophrenia_association_with_depression_anxiety_neurocognitive_deficits_and_the_tryptophan_catabolite_pathway","320942921_Associations_between_severity_of_anxiety_and_clinical_and_biological_features_of_major_affective_disorders","318300215_Depressive_anxiety_and_hypomanic_symptoms_in_schizophrenia_may_be_driven_by_tryptophan_catabolite_TRYCAT_patterning_of_IgA_and_IgM_responses_directed_to_TRYCATs","317946002_Affective_symptoms_in_schizophrenia_are_strongly_associated_with_neurocognitive_deficits_indicating_disorders_in_executive_functions_visual_memory_attention_and_social_cognition","313394410_Neuropsychological_function_in_schizophrenia","312893865_The_validity_of_the_Mini_International_Neuropsychiatric_Interview_MINI-Thai_version","303509338_Secondary_negative_symptoms_-_A_review_of_mechanisms_assessment_and_treatment","301009901_A_review_of_vulnerability_and_risks_for_schizophrenia_Beyond_the_two_hit_hypothesis","299951073_Methodological_Problems_in_Identifying_and_Measuring_First-Rank_Symptoms_of_Schizophrenia","282500571_The_Enduring_Effects_of_Depressive_Thoughts_on_Working_Memory","282044111_Neurocognitive_Impairments_in_Deficit_and_Non-Deficit_Schizophrenia_and_Their_Relationships_with_Symptom_Dimensions_and_Other_Clinical_Variables","271333884_Pain_Affects_Depression_Through_Anxiety_Fatigue_and_Sleep_in_Multiple_Sclerosis","299950911_Long-Term_Monomorphism_of_Negative_and_Positive_Schizophrenic_Episodes","273463229_Mood_and_Anxiety_Disorders_in_Chronic_Fatigue_Syndrome_Fibromyalgia_and_Irritable_Bowel_Syndrome_Results_From_the_LifeLines_Cohort_Study"]}
