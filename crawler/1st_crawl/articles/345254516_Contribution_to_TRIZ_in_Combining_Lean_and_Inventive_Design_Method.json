{"id":"345254516_Contribution_to_TRIZ_in_Combining_Lean_and_Inventive_Design_Method","abstract":"Inventive Design Methodology (IDM) has been developed to provide formalism to classical TRIZ. However, this methodology is perceived as long and tedious by its users with lots of questionable internal activities. Besides, the ability of IDM to give the best result depends on individual knowledge and experiences to provide an accurate initial situation analysis. In parallel to this, lean philosophy is known for combining tools and long-term vision for continuous improvement. It also focuses on removing the non-valuable activities during the process and maximizing the quality of the results. The integration of Lean with the IDM framework led us to propose a new process, which is called Agile Inventive Design Approach (AIDA). In this article, we introduce the initial phase of this new process, and we discuss its differences with other existing methods related to the initial analysis phase of inventive design through a case study.","authors":["Masih Hanifi","Hicham Chibane","R.
