CT scan and MRI use directed intracranial cavity to produce a complete image of brain. This image is visually detected by physician for detection and diagnosis of brain tumor, however, this method is less accurate result in detecting and size of tumor. This paper is based on computer aided method using open CV and embedded system for detection of brain tumor tissue with accuracy and reproducibility compared to other detection. This method for detection of range and shape of tumor in brain MR image using embedded system it reduces the time analysis for detection of brain tumor.","authors":["E.T. Merlin Sathia Raj","M.
