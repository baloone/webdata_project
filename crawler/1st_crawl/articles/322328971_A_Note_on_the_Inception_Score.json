{"id":"322328971_A_Note_on_the_Inception_Score","abstract":"Deep generative models are powerful tools that have produced impressive results in recent years. These advances have been for the most part empirically driven, making it essential that we use high quality evaluation metrics. In this paper, we provide new insights into the Inception Score, a recently proposed and widely used evaluation metric for generative models, and demonstrate that it fails to provide useful guidance when comparing models. We discuss both suboptimalities of the metric itself and issues with its application. Finally, we call for researchers to be more systematic and careful when evaluating and comparing generative models, as the advancement of the field depends upon it.","authors":["Shane Barratt","Rishi Sharma"],"meta":["January 2018"],"references":["322060135_Unpaired_Image-to-Image_Translation_Using_Cycle-Consistent_Adversarial_Networks","321796129_GANs_Trained_by_a_Two_Time-Scale_Update_Rule_Converge_to_a_Local_Nash_Equilibrium","320056020_Long_Text_Generation_via_Adversarial_Training_with_Leaked_Information","311222386_C-RNN-GAN_Continuous_recurrent_neural_networks_with_adversarial_training","310610633_Image-to-Image_Translation_with_Conditional_Adversarial_Networks","308152499_Photo-Realistic_Single_Image_Super-Resolution_Using_a_Generative_Adversarial_Network","305881127_Improved_Techniques_for_Training_GANs","269935591_Explaining_and_Harnessing_Adversarial_Examples","265295439_ImageNet_Large_Scale_Visual_Recognition_Challenge","259440613_Intriguing_properties_of_neural_networks","228849856_Unlearning_for_Better_Mixing","321347462_Are_GANs_Created_Equal_A_Large-Scale_Study","320707565_Progressive_Growing_of_GANs_for_Improved_Quality_Stability_and_Variation","319770355_Generative_Adversarial_Nets","319622545_Deep_Learning_the_Physics_of_Transport_Phenomena","317615062_Variational_Approaches_for_Auto-Encoding_Generative_Adversarial_Networks","306281834_Rethinking_the_Inception_Architecture_for_Computer_Vision","283531533_A_note_on_the_evaluation_of_generative_models"]}
