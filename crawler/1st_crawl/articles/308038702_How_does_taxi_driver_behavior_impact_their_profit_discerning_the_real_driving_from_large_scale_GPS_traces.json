{"id":"308038702_How_does_taxi_driver_behavior_impact_their_profit_discerning_the_real_driving_from_large_scale_GPS_traces","abstract":"With a trend towards the use of large scale vehicle probe data, the entire urban scale analysis is become possible in order to suggest useful information for taxi drivers and passengers. This study, first, we calculate cost using cost-distance algorithm by obtained fare rate and reconstructed trips. Then, the data were analyzed to understand distance profit and service area in timely basis. The result indicated that the pickup rate of taxi in this area is usually peak according to department store operation hours. The highest chance to get customers is in the weekday rush hours between 7am and 10am and at the midnight for the weekend. The increased profits were mainly based on the distance. Finally, the hotspot of taxicabs destinations can be observed at the interchange of major public transportation. These results uncover taxi driving behavior on one of the densest network in Bangkok and yields great benefit for both taxi drivers and passengers.","authors":["Thananut Phiboonbanakit","Teerayut Horanont"],"meta":["September 2016","DOI:10.1145/2968219.2968417","Conference: the 2016 ACM International Joint Conference"],"references":["251714148_A_review_of_the_modeling_of_taxi_services","303043283_Who_will_get_benefit_from_the_new_taxi_fare_rate_Discerning_the_real_driving_from_Taxi_GPS_data","269311744_An_effective_taxi_recommender_system_based_on_a_spatiotemporal_factor_analysis_model","269310080_D-Taxi_Adaptive_area_recommendation_system_for_taxis_by_using_DiRAC","266660447_A_cost-effective_recommender_system_for_taxi_drivers","262291520_HUNTS_A_Trajectory_Recommendation_System_for_Effective_and_Efficient_Hunting_of_Taxi_Passengers","261208228_How_Long_a_Passenger_Waits_for_a_Vacant_Taxi_--_Large-Scale_Taxi_Trace_Mining_for_Smart_Cities","261060339_Recommending_Pick-up_Points_for_Taxi-drivers_Based_on_Spatio-temporal_Clustering","261039123_pCruise_Reducing_Cruising_Miles_for_Taxicab_Networks","224606863_Mining_time-dependent_attractive_areas_and_movement_patterns_from_taxi_trajectory_data","221568732_Where_to_Find_My_Next_Passenger","221023633_Mining_interesting_locations_and_travel_sequences_from_GPS_trajectories"]}
