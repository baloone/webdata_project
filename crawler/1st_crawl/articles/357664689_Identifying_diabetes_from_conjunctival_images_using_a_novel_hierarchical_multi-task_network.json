{"id":"357664689_Identifying_diabetes_from_conjunctival_images_using_a_novel_hierarchical_multi-task_network","abstract":"Diabetes can cause microvessel impairment. However, these conjunctival pathological changes are not easily recognized, limiting their potential as independent diagnostic indicators. Therefore, we designed a deep learning model to explore the relationship between conjunctival features and diabetes, and to advance automated identification of diabetes through conjunctival images. Images were collected from patients with type 2 diabetes and healthy volunteers. A hierarchical multi-tasking network model (HMT-Net) was developed using conjunctival images, and the model was systematically evaluated and compared with other algorithms. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the HMT-Net model to identify diabetes were 78.70%, 69.08%, and 75.15%, respectively. The performance of the HMT-Net model was significantly better than that of ophthalmologists. The model allowed sensitive and rapid discrimination by assessment of conjunctival images and can be potentially useful for identifying diabetes.","authors":["Xinyue Li","Chenjie Xia","Xin Li","Shuangqing Wei"],"meta":["January 2022Scientific Reports 12(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-021-04006-z"],"references":["352297078_Correlation_of_conjunctival_microangiopathy_with_retinopathy_in_Type-2_diabetes_mellitus_T2DM_patients","348779481_Screening_and_identifying_hepatobiliary_diseases_through_deep_learning_using_ocular_images_a_prospective_multicentre_study","344556906_Spectroscopic_detection_of_traumatic_brain_injury_severity_and_biochemistry_from_the_retina","341747375_AI_in_Medical_Imaging_Informatics_Current_Challenges_and_Future_Directions","338128235_Detection_of_anaemia_from_retinal_fundus_images_via_deep_learning","330065177_Artificial_intelligence-based_decision-making_for_age-related_macular_degeneration","323176118_Inter-visit_variability_of_conjunctival_microvascular_hemodynamic_measurements_in_healthy_and_diabetic_retinopathy_subjects","319415855_Predicting_Cardiovascular_Risk_Factors_from_Retinal_Fundus_Photographs_using_Deep_Learning","315957020_Assessment_of_Conjunctival_Microvascular_Hemodynamics_in_Stages_of_Diabetic_Microvasculopathy","313800203_A_clinical_correlation_of_conjunctival_microangiopathy_with_grades_of_retinopathy_in_type_2_diabetes_mellitus"]}
