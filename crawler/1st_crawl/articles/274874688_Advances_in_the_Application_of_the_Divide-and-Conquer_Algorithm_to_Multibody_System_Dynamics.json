{"id":"274874688_Advances_in_the_Application_of_the_Divide-and-Conquer_Algorithm_to_Multibody_System_Dynamics","abstract":"This paper summarizes the various recent advancements achieved by utilizing the divide-and-conquer algorithm (DCA) to reduce the computational burden associated with many aspects of modeling, designing, and simulating articulated multibody systems. This basic algorithm provides a framework to realize O(n) computational complexity for serial task scheduling. Furthermore, the framework of this algorithm easily accommodates parallel task scheduling, which results in coarse-grain O(log n) computational complexity. This is a significant increase in efficiency over forming and solving the Newton-Euler equations directly. A survey of the notable previous work accomplished, though not all inclusive, is provided to give a more complete understanding of how this algorithm has been used in this context. These advances include applying the DCA to constrained systems, flexible bodies, sensitivity analysis, contact, and hybridization with other methods. This work reproduces the basic mathematical framework for applying the DCA in each of these applications. The reader is referred to the original work for the details of the discussed methods.","authors":["Jeremy Laflin","Kurt S. Anderson","Imad M.
