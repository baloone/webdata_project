{"id":"323263595_Mango_Leaf_Unhealthy_Region_Detection_and_Classification","abstract":"Diseases in any plant decrease the productivity and quality of product. Identification of plant leaf diseases by naked human eye is very difficult. Image processing techniques can identify the diseased leaf by preprocessing and classifying leaf unhealthy regions. This paper delivers an implementation on Mango leaf unhealthy region detection and classification. In the Proposed work Multiclass SVM is used for diseases classification and segmentation through k-means. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method in recognizing the diseases affected mango leaf.","authors":["K. Srunitha","D.
