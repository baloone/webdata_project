Machine learning (ML) has been the primary concern of diagnosis support according to comprehensive patient information. A prominent issue is the development of objective treatment processes in clinical situations. This study proposes a framework to plan treatment processes in a data-driven manner. A key point of the framework is the evaluation of the actionability for personal health improvements by using a surrogate Bayesian model in addition to a high-performance nonlinear ML model. We first evaluate the framework from the viewpoint of its methodology using a synthetic dataset. Subsequently, the framework is applied to an actual health checkup dataset comprising data from 3132 participants, to lower systolic blood pressure and risk of chronic kidney disease at the individual level. We confirm that the computed treatment processes are actionable and consistent with clinical knowledge for improving these values. We also show that the improvement processes presented by the framework can be clinically informative. These results demonstrate that our framework can contribute toward decision-making in the medical field, providing clinicians with deeper insights. Clinical decision-making regarding treatments based on personal characteristics leads to effective health improvements. Here, the authors introduce a modeling framework to evaluate the actionability of treatment pathways.","authors":["Kazuki Nakamura","Ryosuke Kojima","Eiichiro Uchino","Koh Ono"],"meta":["May 2021Nature Communications 12(1):3088","DOI:10.1038/s41467-021-23319-1"],"references":["339847881_Artificial_intelligence_with_multi-functional_machine_learning_platform_development_for_better_healthcare_and_precision_medicine","337676294_Gamma-glutamyl_transpeptidase_g-GTP_has_an_ambivalent_association_with_hypertension_and_atherosclerosis_among_elderly_Japanese_men_a_cross-sectional_study","334895492_The_Japanese_Society_of_Hypertension_Guidelines_for_the_Management_of_Hypertension_JSH_2019","334758532_On_the_interpretability_of_machine_learning-based_model_for_predicting_hypertension","332017484_Machine_Learning_SNP_Based_Prediction_for_Precision_Medicine","354481884_Interpretable_Counterfactual_Explanations_Guided_by_Prototypes","337745014_Actionable_Recourse_in_Linear_Classification","335750982_Prognostic_models_will_be_victims_of_their_own_success_unless","334992316_Interpretability_in_HealthCare_A_Comparative_Study_of_Local_Machine_Learning_Interpretability_Techniques","334839965_Fasting_Blood_Glucose_Predicts_Incidence_of_Hypertension_Independent_of_HbA1c_Levels_and_Insulin_Resistance_in_Middle-Aged_Japanese_The_Saku_Study","328199860_Explainable_machine-learning_predictions_for_the_prevention_of_hypoxaemia_during_surgery","327709435_Peeking_Inside_the_Black-Box_A_Survey_on_Explainable_Artificial_Intelligence_XAI","326977187_Actionable_Recourse_in_Linear_Classification","327921206_Associations_of_Body_Composition_with_Blood_Pressure_and_Hypertension_Body_Composition_and_Blood_Pressure","327115608_Fasting_blood_glucose_is_predictive_of_hypertension_in_a_general_Japanese_population"]}
