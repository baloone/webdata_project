{"id":"298907360_Three-Way_Decisions_and_Cognitive_Computing","abstract":"A trisecting-and-acting model explains three-way decisions (3WD) in terms of two basic tasks. One task is to divide a universal set into three pair-wise disjoint regions called a trisection or a tri-partition of the universal set. The other task is to act upon objects in one or more regions by developing appropriate strategies. 3WD are a class of effective ways and heuristics commonly used in human problem solving and information processing. We argue that 3WD are built on solid cognitive foundations and offer cognitive advantages and benefits. We demonstrate the flexibility and general applicability of 3WD by using examples from across many fields and disciplines.","authors":["Yiyu Yao"],"meta":["August 2016Cognitive Computation 8(4)","DOI:10.1007/s12559-016-9397-5"],"references":["286301663_Statistical_Interpretations_of_Three-Way_Decisions","285747255_Advances_in_three-way_decisions_and_granular_computing","354099774_Thinking_Fast_and_Slow_in_AI","335955235_Looking_toward_the_Future_with_Cognitive_Computing_AI_and_Big_Data_Analytics","319770401_Vision_A_Computational_Investigation_into_the_Human_Representation_and_Processing_of_Visual_Information","306939383_The_magical_number_seven_plus_or_minus_two_Some_limits_on_our_capacity_to_process_information","300222945_Rough_Sets_and_Three-Way_Decisions","298101961_Methods_and_Practices_of_Three-Way_Decisions_for_Complex_Problem_Solving","290882608_Semantic_Information_Retrieval","289516799_Granular_Computing_and_Sequential_Three-Way_Decisions","284012688_Three-way_decisions_based_software_defect_prediction","283562908_Approximate_concept_construction_with_three-way_decisions_and_attribute_reduction_in_incomplete_contexts","283539127_Multi-granular_mining_for_boundary_regions_in_three-way_decision_theory","282968140_The_connections_between_three-way_and_classical_concept_lattices","282582306_Fuzzy_probabilistic_rough_sets_and_their_corresponding_three-way_decisions"]}
