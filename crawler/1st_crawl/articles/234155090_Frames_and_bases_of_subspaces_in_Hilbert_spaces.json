{"id":"234155090_Frames_and_bases_of_subspaces_in_Hilbert_spaces","abstract":"In this paper we develop the frame theory of subspaces for separable Hilbert spaces. We will show that for every Parseval frame of subspaces {W i } i∈I for a Hilbert space H , there exists a Hilbert space K ⊇ H and an orthonormal basis of subspaces {N i } i∈I for K such that W i = P (N i), where P is the orthogonal projection of K onto H . We introduce a new definition of atomic resolution of the identity in Hilbert spaces. In particular, we define an atomic resolution operator for an atomic resolution of the identity, which even yield a reconstruction formula.","authors":["Mohammad Sadegh Asgari","Amir Khosravi"],"meta":["August 2005Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications 308(2):541-553","DOI:10.1016/j.jmaa.2004.11.036"],"references":["252340981_Painless_Nonorthogonal_Expansions","234155144_New_characterizations_of_fusion_frames_frames_of_subspaces","216027366_Continuous_and_discrete_wavelet_transforms_SIAM_Review_31_628-666","200524280_Frames_bases_and_group_representations","2142914_The_Art_of_Frame_Theory","1756847_Operator-Valued_frames","284317755_Parallel_discrete_and_continuous_wavelet_transforms","245849079_Decompositions_of_Hilbert_spaces_local_construction_of_global_frames","245346199_An_Introduction_to_Nonharmonic_Fourier_Series","238870438_Pre-Frame_Operators_Besselian_Frames_and_Near-Riesz_Bases_in_Hilbert_Spaces","234155148_On_the_stability_of_fusion_frames_frames_of_subspaces","232243085_Frames_of_subspaces","222639907_On_the_duality_of_fusion_frames","222162864_Quasi-orthogonal_decompositions_of_structured_frames","220026743_Functional_analysis","200524234_A_Class_of_Nonharmonic_Fourier_Series","200524207_An_Introduction_to_Frames_and_Riesz_Bases","40220812_Perturbations_of_Banach_Frames_and_Atomic_Decompositions","2799997_Continuous_and_Discrete_Wavelet_Transforms","2109727_Frames_of_subspaces"]}
