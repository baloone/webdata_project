{"id":"317146044_Natural_Language_Processing_and_Fuzzy_Tools_for_Business_Processes_in_a_Geolocation_Context","abstract":"In the geolocation field where high-level programs and low-level devices coexist, it is often difficult to find a friendly user interface to configure all the parameters. The challenge addressed in this paper is to propose intuitive and simple, thus natural language interfaces to interact with low-level devices. Such interfaces contain natural language processing (NLP) and fuzzy representations of words that facilitate the elicitation of business-level objectives in our context. A complete methodology is proposed, from the lexicon construction to a dialogue software agent including a fuzzy linguistic representation, based on synonymy.","authors":["Isis Truck","Mohammed-Amine Abchir"],"meta":["May 2017Advances in Artificial Intelligence 2017(1):1-11","DOI:10.1155/2017/9462457"],"references":["278328726_On_Using_Fuzzy_Linguistic_2-Tuples_for_the_Evaluation_of_Human_Resource_Suitability_in_Software_Development_Tasks","314830407_Towards_a_theory_of_natural_language_interfaces_to_databases","297481405_A_2-tuple_fuzzy_linguistic_representation_model_for_computing_with_words","288786825_The_2-tuple_Linguistic_Model_Computing_with_Words_in_Decision_Making","282162224_Semantic_parsing_on_freebase_from_question-answer_pairs","279245956_Comparison_and_links_between_two_2-tuple_linguistic_models_for_decision_making","278773376_Le_dictionnaire_Electronique_des_Synonymes_du_CRISCO_methode_d'utilisation_et_exploitation_psycholinguistique","274846007_Discourse_Analysis","262677608_FLINTSTONES_A_fuzzy_linguistic_decision_tools_enhancement_suite_based_on_the_2-tuple_linguistic_model_and_extensions","261719887_Toward_a_Classification_of_Hesitant_Operators_in_the_2-Tuple_Linguistic_Model"]}
