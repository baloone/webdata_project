{"id":"312923284_Toward_an_Understanding_of_Economic_Growth_in_Africa_A_Reinterpretation_of_the_Lewis_Model","abstract":"We develop a model economy that has many of the features of Lewis (1954) but that also includes an in-between sector as described by Lewis (1979). Our model underscores the importance of the following determinants of structural change: (i) productivity growth in the agricultural sector; (ii) productivity growth in the nonagricultural sector and; (iii) the terms of trade. Public investment enhances productivity growth in all sectors but when it is financed by foreign inflows, it also causes a real exchange rate appreciation leading to a contraction in the open modern sector. These results provide a partial explanation for recent patterns of growth in Rwanda and elsewhere in Africa where the nontradables or what we call the in-between sector has expanded more rapidly than the tradable sector. Our results also highlight the dilemma faced by poor countries in dire need of public investment with a very limited tax base.","authors":["Xinshen Diao","Margaret McMillan"],"meta":["January 2017World Development 109","DOI:10.1016/j.worlddev.2016.12.008"],"references":["289539415_Rethinking_Indonesia's_Informal_Sector","284913828_Premature_deindustrialization","272261679_The_Role_of_Agriculture_in_the_Fast-Growing_Rwandan_Economy_Assessing_Growth_Alternatives","323765861_Do_Credit_Constraints_Limit_Entrepreneurship_Heterogeneity_in_the_Returns_to_Microfinance","322726268_An_African_Growth_Miracle","318830632_Identifying_and_Spurring_High-Growth_Entrepreneurship_Experimental_Evidence_from_a_Business_Plan_Competition","307426961_BIOLOGICAL_IMPORTANCE_OF_COPPER_IN_THE_SEA_-_A_LITERATURE_REVIEW","303818626_Economic_Development_with_Unlimited_Supplies_of_Labour","277368790_Unconditional_Convergence_in_Manufacturing","273858423_Globalization_Structural_Change_and_Productivity_Growth_With_an_Update_on_Africa"]}
