{"id":"242913636_Efficient_Algorithms_for_Computing_a_Strong_Rank-Revealing_QR_Factorization","abstract":"Given an m x n matrix M with m â¥ n, it is shown that there exists a permutation Î and an integer k such that the QR factorization given by equation (1) reveals the numerical rank of M: the k x k upper-triangular matrix A{sub k} is well conditioned, norm of (C{sub k})â is small, and B{sub k} is linearly dependent on A{sub k} with coefficients bounded by a low-degree polynomial in n. Existing rank-revealing QR (RRQR) algorithms are related to such factorizations and two algorithms are presented for computing them. The new algorithms are nearly as efficient as QR with column pivoting for most problems and take O(mnÂ²) floating-point operations in the worst case.","authors":["Ming Gu","Stanley C.
