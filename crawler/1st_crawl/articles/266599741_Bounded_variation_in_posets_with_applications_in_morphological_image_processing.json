{"id":"266599741_Bounded_variation_in_posets_with_applications_in_morphological_image_processing","abstract":"This paper is motivated by a problem in morphological image processing: how to construct a flat operator on grey-level images (numerical functions) from a non-increasing operator on binary images (sets). The solution involves the decomposition of a function with bounded variation into a linear combination of increasing (or decreasing) functions, and this for several types of functions, defined on various domains: subsets of a space, discrete or continuous numerical values, vectors, etc. Therefore we study bounded variation for functions defined on an arbitrary poset (partially ordered set), and the related topic of function summation. Of particular interest is the decomposition of a binary-valued function into an alternating sum and difference of increasing binary-valued functions.","authors":["Christian Ronse"],"meta":[],"references":[]}
