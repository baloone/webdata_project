{"id":"305414069_Computation_of_regular_expression_derivatives","abstract":"The conversion of regular expressions into finite state automata and finite state automata into regular expression is an important area of research in automata theory. The notion of derivatives of regular expressions has been introduced to make the construction of finite state automata from regular expressions in a natural way. Recently, a general structure has been proposed to find the derivatives of regular expressions to reduce the difficulties arising out of the earlier methods. In this paper, some properties of the derivatives of regular expressions, the quotient language, and how the derivatives are found through a general structure, have been discussed in detail.","authors":["N.
