{"id":"225878794_The_Theory_of_Multidimensional_Persistence","abstract":"Persistent homology captures the topology of a filtration—aone-parameter family of increasing spaces—in terms of a complete\ndiscrete invariant. This invariant is a multiset of intervals that denote the lifetimes of the topological entities within\nthe filtration. In many applications of topology, we need to study a multifiltration: afamily of spaces parameterized along\nmultiple geometric dimensions. In this paper, we show that no similar complete discrete invariant exists for multidimensional\npersistence. Instead, we propose the rank invariant, adiscrete invariant for the robust estimation of Betti numbers in a multifiltration, and prove its completeness in one\ndimension.","authors":["Gunnar Carlsson","Afra Zomorodian"],"meta":["June 2007Discrete & Computational Geometry 42(1):71-93","DOI:10.1007/s00454-009-9176-0","SourceDBLP"],"references":["248117036_Topological_estimation_using_witness_complexes","316801060_Springer_Monographs_in_Mathematics","266753223_Algebra_VIII_Representations_of_finite-dimensional_algebras_Transl_from_the_Russian","265715713_Gauss-Manin_Connections_for_Arrangements_I_Eigenvalues","265681744_Hyperbolic_Groups","265333034_An_Introduction_to_Homological_Algebra","256844906_Geometric_Invariant_Theory","248787327_Moduli_space_of_combinatorially_equivalent_arrangements_of_hyperplanes_and_logarithmic_Gauss-Manin_connections","245346145_An_Introduction_to_Homological_Algebra","242505554_Commutative_Algebra_with_a_View_Toward_Algebraic_Geometry"]}
