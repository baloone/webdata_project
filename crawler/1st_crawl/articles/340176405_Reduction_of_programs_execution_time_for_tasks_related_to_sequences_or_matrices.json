{"id":"340176405_Reduction_of_programs_execution_time_for_tasks_related_to_sequences_or_matrices","abstract":"The article discusses three approaches to reducing runtime of the programs, which are\nsolutions of Olympiad tasks on computer science, related to sequences or matrices. The first approach is\nbased on the representation of some sequences in matrix form and then the program of calculating the\nmembers of the sequence will have asymptotics equal to the time complexity of the exponentiation\nalgorithm and will be O(log (n)). The second approach is to upgrade the known code to obtain significant\nreduction of the program runtime. This approach is very important to know for scientists who write code\nfor scientific researches and are faced with matrix multiplication operations. The third approach is based\non reducing time complexity by search for regularities; the author's task is presented and this approach is\nused to solve it.","authors":["Oleksandr Mitsa","Yurii Horoshko","Serhii Vapnichnyi"],"meta":["January 2020SHS Web of Conferences 75:04019","DOI:10.1051/shsconf/20207504019"],"references":["334239674_METODICNI_PIDHODI_DO_ROZV'AZUVANNA_OLIMPIADNIH_ZADAC_Z_INFORMATIKI","262493823_The_Art_of_Computer_Programming"]}
