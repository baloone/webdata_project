{"id":"329417450_Positive_and_negative_cycles_in_Boolean_networks","abstract":"We review and discuss some results about the influence of positive and negative feedback cycles in asynchronous Boolean networks. These results merge several ideas of Thomas: positive and negative feedback cycles have been largely emphasized by Thomas, through the so called Thomasâ€™ rules, and asynchronous Boolean networks have been introduced by Thomas as a model for the dynamics of gene networks, which is nowadays very popular.","authors":["Adrien Richard"],"meta":["December 2018Journal of Theoretical Biology 463","DOI:10.1016/j.jtbi.2018.11.028"],"references":["323597972_Local_Negative_Circuits_and_Cyclic_Attractors_in_Boolean_Networks_with_at_most_Five_Components","312100924_Synchronism_versus_asynchronism_in_monotonic_Boolean_automata_networks","307434764_Asynchronous_Simulation_of_Boolean_Networks_by_Monotone_Boolean_Networks","303690884_Logical_Modeling_and_Dynamical_Analysis_of_Cellular_Networks","291421926_Computational_Modeling_Formal_Analysis_and_Tools_for_Systems_Biology","322038936_A_circuit-preserving_mapping_from_multilevel_to_Boolean_dynamics","320181465_The_origins_of_order_self-organization_and_selection_in_evolution","319534546_On_the_Stability_and_Instability_of_Finite_Dynamical_Systems_with_Prescribed_Interaction_Graphs","315457188_On_the_conversion_of_multivalued_gene_regulatory_networks_to_Boolean_dynamics","301848264_Number_of_Fixed_Points_and_Disjoint_Cycles_in_Monotone_Boolean_Networks"]}
