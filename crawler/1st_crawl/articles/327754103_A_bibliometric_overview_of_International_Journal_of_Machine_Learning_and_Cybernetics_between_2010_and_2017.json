{"id":"327754103_A_bibliometric_overview_of_International_Journal_of_Machine_Learning_and_Cybernetics_between_2010_and_2017","abstract":"International Journal of Machine Learning and Cybernetics (IJMLC) is one of the influential journals in the area of computer science, and it published its first issue in 2010. On the one hand, taking the 544 IJMLC publications between 2010 and 2017 as the research object, this paper uses bibliometric methods to study the citation characteristics, international cooperation and institutional cooperation, the authorâ€™s cooperation rate and cooperation degree, geographical distribution of the IJMLC publications. On the other hand, CiteSpace and Vosviewer, two data visualization software tools, are used to make the comprehensive analysis of the co-occurrence of the author keywords of the IJMLC publications. The document co-citation clusters visualization and burst detection of keywords are also presented to explore the development of the research trends. The research results in this paper provide a basis for further improving the academic level and quality of the IJMLC.","authors":["Zeshui Xu","Dejian Yu","Xizhao Wang"],"meta":["September 2019International Journal of Machine Learning and Cybernetics 10(4)","DOI:10.1007/s13042-018-0875-9"],"references":["327349448_Bibliometric_analysis_on_the_evolution_of_applied_intelligence","320370459_A_bibliometric_and_social_network_analysis_of_pelvic_organ_prolapse_during_2007-2016","341119222_Bibliometric_analysis_of_production_planning_and_control_1990-2016","325500098_Visualizing_social_acceptance_research","324139566_A_bibliometric_analysis_of_creativity_in_the_field_of_business_economics","321269797_Bibliometric_analysis_of_fuzzy_theory_research_in_China_A_30-year_perspective","319594822_Forty_years_of_Computers_Industrial_Engineering_A_bibliometric_analysis","319056299_Information_Sciences_1968-2016_A_retrospective_analysis_with_text_mining_and_bibliometric","318914625_Interval-valued_dual_hesitant_fuzzy_uncertain_linguistic_aggregation_operators_in_multiple_attribute_decision_making","316178528_Forty_years_of_the_European_Journal_of_Operational_Research_A_bibliometric_overview","314249149_The_Structure_and_Citation_Landscape_of_IEEE_Transactions_on_Fuzzy_Systems_1994-2015","311700868_A_Bibliometric_Analysis_of_Operations_Research_and_Management_Science","309465799_Thirty_Years_of_the_International_Journal_of_Intelligent_Systems_A_Bibliometric_Review","304134552_Improving_learning_accuracy_of_fuzzy_decision_trees_by_hybrid_neural_networks","301346344_Multigranulation_rough_sets_in_incomplete_information_system"]}
