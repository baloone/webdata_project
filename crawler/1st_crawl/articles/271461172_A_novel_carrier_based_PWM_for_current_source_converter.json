{"id":"271461172_A_novel_carrier_based_PWM_for_current_source_converter","abstract":"In this paper, a novel carrier based PWM for the three-phase current source converters(CSCs) is proposed, which employs two triangular carriers and three reference signals for three-phase system. By using the proposed PWM for CSC, the gating signals can be directly generated without any translation from the gating signals of VSC. This paper confirms the validity and effectiveness of the proposed carrier based PWM method by simulation results.","authors":["Noah C Choi","Kwang-Woon Lee","Byung Moon Han"],"meta":["June 2012","DOI:10.1109/IPEMC.2012.6259137","Conference: 2012 7th International Power Electronics and Motion Control Conference (IPEMC 2012)"],"references":["224172244_Boost_mode_test_of_a_current-source-inverter-fed_permanent_magnet_synchronous_motor_drive_for_automotive_applications","3536915_Pulsewidth_modulation--A_survey","224608466_A_generic_six-step_direct_PWM_SS-DPWM_scheme_for_current_source_converter","37425202_PWM_Current_converter_for_electric_energy_production_systems_from_fuel-cells","4099671_Carrier-based_discontinuous_PWM_modulation_for_current_source_converters","3714588_Charge_controlled_modulation_of_a_current_source_inverter","3279108_Current_Source_Inverter_Modulation","3217927_Relationship_between_space-vector_modulation_and_three-phase_carrier-based_PWM_a_comprehensive_analysis_three-phase_inverters","3217243_Current-source_converter_on-line_pattern_generator_switching_frequency_minimization"]}
