{"id":"323295830_Reliability_and_Energy_Efficiency_Enhancement_for_Emergency-Aware_Wireless_Body_Area_Networks_WBAN","abstract":"Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols based on Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) can improve the reliability and efficiency of WBAN. However, traditional static TDMA techniques adopted by IEEE 802.15.4 and IEEE 802.15.6 do not sufficiently consider the channel status or the buffer requirements of the nodes within heterogeneous contexts. Although there are some solutions that have been proposed to alleviate the effect of the deep fade in WBAN channel by adopting dynamic slot allocation, these solutions still suffer from some reliability and energy efficiency issues and they do not avoid channel deep fading. This paper presents two novel and generic TDMA based techniques to improve WBAN reliability and energy efficiency. Both techniques synchronize nodes adaptively whilst tackling their channel and buffer status in normal and emergency contexts. Extensive simulation experiments using various traffic rates and time slot lengths demonstrate that the proposed techniques improve the reliability and the energy efficiency compared to IEEE 802.15.4 and IEEE 802.15.6 in both situations, the normal and emergency contexts. This improvement has been achieved in terms of packet loss, up to 90% and energy consumption, up to 13%, confirming the significant enhancements made by the developed scheduling techniques.","authors":["Marwa Salayma","Amed Al-Dubai","Imed Romdhani","Nasser Youssef"],"meta":["February 2018","DOI:10.1109/TGCN.2018.2813060","Project: Routing in low power and lossy networks"],"references":["309264091_Reliability_and_Energy_Efficiency_Enhancement_in_Wireless_Body_Area_Networks_for_E-Health","292152547_Wireless_Body_Area_Network_WBAN_A_Survey_on_Reliability_Fault_Tolerance_and_Technologies_Coexistence","278672591_Battery_Aware_and_Reliable_Beacon_Enabled_IEEE802154_An_Adaptive_and_Cross-Layer_Approach","258402256_IEEE802_154_Performance_in_Various_WSNs_Applications","254463823_Impact_of_Wireless_Channel_Temporal_Variation_on_MAC_Design_for_Body_Area_Networks","242712090_ZigBeeIEEE_802154_Summary","238523850_CA-MAC_A_Hybrid_context-aware_MAC_protocol_for_wireless_body_area_networks","233828497_Variable_Scheduling_to_Mitigate_Channel_Losses_in_Energy-Efficient_Body_Area_Networks","221815683_A_study_of_MAC_protocols_for_WBANs","221091751_WiseMAC_an_ultra_low_power_MAC_protocol_for_the_wiseNET_wireless_sensor_network","220279082_A_Survey_on_Context-Aware_Sensing_for_Body_Sensor_Networks","38027265_Energy-Efficient_Low_Duty_Cycle_MAC_Protocol_for_Wireless_Body_Area_Networks","316441318_Adaptive_Duty_Cycle_ADC_energy_efficient_algorithm_for_ZigBee_networks","312990382_New_Dynamic_Reliable_and_Energy_Efficient_Scheduling_for_Wireless_Body_Area_Networks_WBAN","299544895_Medium_Access_Control_for_Wireless_Body_Area_Networks_with_QoS_Provisioning_and_Energy_Efficient_Design","292152304_BARBEI_A_new_adaptive_battery_aware_and_reliable_beacon_enabled_technique_for_IEEE_802154_MAC","260657286_Context_aware_and_channel-based_resource_allocation_for_wireless_body_area_networks","254059006_Challenges_in_Body_Area_Networks_for_Healthcare_The_MAC","254005146_Contention_vs_polling_A_study_in_body_area_networks_MAC_design","224566850_An_Adaptive_Energy_Efficient_MAC_Protocol_for_the_Medical_Body_Area_Network","224347196_Energy_Efficient_Medium_Access_Protocol_for_Wireless_Medical_Body_Area_Sensor_Networks","224084578_BodyMAC_Energy_efficient_TDMA-based_MAC_protocol_for_wireless_body_area_networks","221081191_Energy-efficient_retransmission_strategies_under_variable_TDMA_scheduling_in_body_area_networks","220639860_Battery-Dynamics_Driven_TDMA_MAC_Protocols_for_Wireless_Body-Area_Monitoring_Networks_in_Healthcare_Applications"]}
