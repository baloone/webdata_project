{"id":"283804133_Systems_of_k_Boolean_Inequations","abstract":"The problem of solving generalized systems of Boolean equations is open. One part of this problem is to solve the system of k Boolean inequations. In this paper we give all the solutions of the system of k Boolean inequations.","authors":["Ulfeta Marovac"],"meta":["January 2015Journal of Multiple-valued Logic and Soft Computing 25(4):447-459"],"references":["279321874_System_of_Two_Boolean_Inequations","268314882_Lattice_Functions_and_Equations","242799661_Formulas_of_general_solutions_of_Boolean_equations","237124065_Boolean_Functions_and_Equations","222598542_Boolean_inequations","220547644_Boolean_Equations_and_Boolean_Inequations"]}
