{"id":"338387643_Scalable_Distributed_Evolutionary_Algorithm_Orchestration_using_Docker_Containers","abstract":"In smart factories, integrated optimisation of manufacturing process planning and scheduling leads to better results than a traditional sequential approach but is computationally more expensive and thus difficult to be applied to real-world manufacturing scenarios. In this paper, a working approach for cloud-based distributed optimisation for process planning and scheduling is presented. Three managers dynamically governing the creation and deletion of subpopulations (islands) evolved by a multi-objective genetic algorithm are proposed, compared and contrasted. A number of test cases based on two real-world manufacturing scenarios are used to show the applicability of the proposed solution.","authors":["Piotr Dziurzanski","Shuai Zhao","Michał Przewoźniczek","Marcin Komarnicki"],"meta":["December 2019Journal of Computational Science 40","DOI:10.1016/j.jocs.2019.101069"],"references":["332806619_Solving_the_Multi-Objective_Flexible_Job-Shop_Scheduling_Problem_with_Alternative_Recipes_for_a_Chemical_Production_Process","332763133_Cloud-based_Dynamic_Distributed_Optimisation_of_Integrated_Process_Planning_and_Scheduling_in_Smart_Factories_of_Integrated_Process_Planning_and_Scheduling_in_Smart_Factories","320936954_A_New_Efficient_Entropy_Population-Merging_Parallel_Model_for_Evolutionary_Algorithms","319098122_Performance_metrics_in_multi-objective_optimization","318327936_Dynamic_Island_Model_based_on_Spectral_Clustering_in_Genetic_Algorithm","305996412_Using_Docker_in_High_Performance_Computing_Applications","305685595_The_Seamless_Peer_and_Cloud_Evolution_Framework","271669733_A_state-of-the-art_survey_of_cloud_manufacturing","266880452_Cloud_manufacturing_A_computing_and_service-oriented_manufacturing_model","261520468_Diversity_Comparison_of_Pareto_Front_Approximations_in_Many-Objective_Optimization","235705955_Towards_Migrating_Genetic_Algorithms_for_Test_Data_Generation_to_the_Cloud","224247020_A_comparison_of_dominance_criteria_in_many-objective_optimization_problems","220403533_Pareto_Simulated_Annealing_for_Fuzzy_Multi-Objective_Combinatorial_Optimization","220381802_Integration_of_process_planning_and_scheduling_a_state-of-the-art_review","4243282_MASON_A_proposal_for_an_ontology_of_manufacturing_domain","3418989_MOEAD_A_Multiobjective_Evolutionary_Algorithm_Based_on_Decomposition","329504914_Implementing_Digital_Twins_of_Smart_Factories_with_Interval_Algebra","328255792_Speed_up_genetic_algorithms_in_the_cloud_using_software_containers","326243039_A_modern_event-based_architecture_for_distributed_evolutionary_algorithms","325054128_Value-Based_Manufacturing_Optimisation_in_Serverless_Clouds_for_Industry_40","318376439_Load_balance_aware_distributed_differential_evolution_for_computationally_expensive_optimization_problems","316799237_Monte_Carlo_Methods","301363476_Integrated_process_planning_and_scheduling_for_large-scale_flexible_job_shops_using_metaheuristics","300228807_On_the_Utility_of_Island_Models_in_Dynamic_Optimization","299375428_Active_Multi_Population_Pattern_Searching_Algorithm_for_Flow_Optimization_in_Computer_Networks_-_the_novel_coevolution_schema_combined_with_linkage_learning","289504267_Towards_Smart_Factory_for_Industry_40_A_Self-organized_Multi-agent_System_with_Big_Data_Based_Feedback_and_Coordination","287406344_Modified_Distance_Calculation_in_Generational_Distance_and_Inverted_Generational_Distance","271479798_Distributed_Genetic_Algorithm_for_Integrated_Process_Planning_and_Scheduling_Based_on_Multi_Agent_System","261163854_A_Performance_Study_on_the_VM_Startup_Time_in_the_Cloud","220380799_Multi_Population_Pattern_Searching_Algorithm_A_New_Evolutionary_Method_Based_on_the_Idea_of_Messy_Genetic_Algorithm"]}
