{"id":"283090976_A_Real-Time_Human_Action_Recognition_System_Using_Depth_and_Inertial_Sensor_Fusion","abstract":"This paper presents a human action recognition system that runs in real-time and uses a depth camera and an inertial sensor simultaneously based on a previously developed sensor fusion method. Computationally efficient depth image features and inertial signals features are fed into two computationally efficient collaborative representative classifiers. A decision-level fusion is then performed. The developed real-time system is evaluated using a publicly available multimodal human action recognition dataset by considering a comprehensive set of human actions. The overall classification rate of the developed real-time system is shown to be more than 97% which is at least 9% higher than when each sensing modality is used individually. The results from both offline and real-time experimentations demonstrate the effectiveness of the system and its real-time throughputs.
