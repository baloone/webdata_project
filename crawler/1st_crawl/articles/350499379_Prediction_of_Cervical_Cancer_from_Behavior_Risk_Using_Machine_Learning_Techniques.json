{"id":"350499379_Prediction_of_Cervical_Cancer_from_Behavior_Risk_Using_Machine_Learning_Techniques","abstract":"Cervical cancer growth is the fourth maximum of regular diseases in females. It is one of the sicknesses which is compromising ladies' wellbeing everywhere in the world and it is difficult to notice any sign in the beginning phase. But the screening process of cervical cancer sometimes is being hampered due to some social-behavioral factors. There is still a limited number of researches directed in cervical cancer identification dependent on the behavior and machine learning in the area of gynecology and computer science. In this research, we have proposed three machine learning models such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost to predict cervical cancer from behavior and its variables and we got significantly improved outcomes than the current methods with 93.33% accuracy. Moreover, we have shown the top features from the dataset according to the feature important scores to know their impacts on the development of the classification model.","authors":["Laboni Akter","Ferdib Al Islam","Md.
