{"id":"326052534_Simulation_Applied_to_Urban_Logistics_A_State_of_the_Art_Towards_Sustainable_and_Liveable_Cities","abstract":"This chapter provides a review of simulation techniques applied to urban logistics with a focus on practical applications. Several techniques and tools have been proposed to simulate different systems in urban logistics. The chapter proposes a state‐of‐the‐art review of the existing simulation techniques in the field of urban logistics. It also proposes a synthesis of the opportunities for simulation in urban logistics. The chapter presents an analytical framework of the existing simulation techniques, their inherent choices and their advantages and drawbacks. This framework examines the choice of simulation techniques of the reviewed publications. The chapter explores a practical reference for urban logistics researchers and practitioners who wish to use simulation in order to study the behavior and performance of their systems. Finally, it draws the reader's attention to consider the use of hybrid simulation techniques.","authors":["Jlassi Sarra","Simon Tamayo Giraldo","Arthur Gaudron"],"meta":["June 2018","DOI:10.1002/9781119425472.ch4","In book: City Logistics 3 (pp.65-87)","Project: City Logistics Research Chair (Chaire Logistique Urbaine)"],"references":["325210903_Implementing_electric_vehicles_in_urban_distribution_A_discrete_event_simulation","306157680_Discrete_Event_Simulation_System_Dynamics_and_Agent_Based_Simulation_Discussion_and_Comparison","306075020_Loadingunloading_lay-by_areas_location_and_sizing_a_mixed_analytic-Monte_Carlo_simulation_approach","299459988_Methodology_to_Evaluate_the_Operational_Suitability_of_Electromobility_Systems_for_Urban_Logistics_Operations","291833459_A_participatory_simulation_gaming_framework_for_the_validation_of_an_agent_based_5_model_the_case_of_city_logistics","330484976_Introduction_to_Elementary_Computational_Modeling_Essential_Concepts_Principles_and_Problem_Solving","307878522_Validation_of_an_agent_based_model_using_a_participatory_simulation_gaming_approach_The_case_of_city_logistics","306093096_An_Agent-Based_Simulation_Framework_to_Evaluate_Urban_Logistics_Schemes","301574358_Discrete_Event_Simulation_of_Loading_Unloading_Operations_in_a_Specific_Intermodal_Transportation_Context","301364986_A_freight_urban_distribution_center_design_with_micro-simulation_support_for_city_logistics"]}
