{"id":"339133313_Does_exergaming_drive_future_physical_activity_and_sport_intentions","abstract":"We studied how usability and playability of sport exergames affect future intentions of participation in physical activity or actual sport. We employed questionnaires to measure participants’ enjoyment, usability, game-experience, and future intentions of physical activity and real sport. We compared the outcomes based on players’ gender, previous real-swimming, and exergame experience. Psychological parameters were not different between groups but players without exergame experience enjoyed the game more. Physical activity intentions increased for all participants but not swimming intentions. The limitations of current gaming systems and their effects on players’ gaming experience and intentions are discussed.","authors":["Pooya Soltani","Pedro Figueiredo","J.
