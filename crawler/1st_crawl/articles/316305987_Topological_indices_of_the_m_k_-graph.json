{"id":"316305987_Topological_indices_of_the_m_k_-graph","abstract":"This paper is devoted to the study of a new graph, called -graph and denoted by , that arises from a simple graph G by k successive iterations of a special kind of construction. We provide some of its topological indices such as Wiener index, Hyper-Wiener index, Wiener polarity, Zagreb indices, Schultz and modified Schultz indices and Wiener-type invariant. Some Formulas concerning classical graphs are settled to show the scope of this study.","authors":["Ahmed Ayache","Abdu Alameri"],"meta":["April 2017Journal of the Association of Arab Universities for Basic and Applied Sciences 24(C)","DOI:10.1016/j.jaubas.2017.03.001","Project: Modelling chemical and physical properties of molecules"],"references":["292319038_Computation_of_Topological_Indices_of_Dutch_Windmill_Graph","290441741_On_the_Bounds_of_the_First_Reformulated_Zagreb_Index","282791723_On_Zagreb_Indices_and_Coindices","282392595_Sharp_lower_bounds_for_the_Zagreb_indices_of_unicyclic_graphs","267431141_The_Hyper-Wiener_Polynomial_of_Graphs","261296695_Extremal_Graphs_under_Wiener-type_Invariants","261179457_Extremal_Graphs_under_Wiener-type_Invariants","316799358_Graduate_Texts_in_Mathematics","313603847_Some_properties_of_the_second_Zagreb_index","268635657_Some_New_Results_on_Distance-Based_Polynomials"]}
