{"id":"340466819_To_learn_scientifically_effectively_and_enjoyably_A_review_of_educational_games","abstract":"With the rapid development of technology, the variety, quality, performance, and social penetration of video games has reached an unprecedented height. The cross‐border combination of education and games has received extensive attention from various areas of society, including education, technology, and so forth. Educational games can create an attractive learning environment for students, make learning more interesting, and enable students to learn by doing, thus improving students' high‐level abilities. Educational games can make learning more scientific, enjoyable, and more effective. Many scholars and institutions have carried out a lot of research and practice about educational games. Based on the educational games research, this review will answer four questions: What are educational games? What is educational games research currently studying? What are the outcomes and benefits of educational games? What are the research directions of future educational games?","authors":["Jialing Zeng","Sophie Parks","Junjie Shang"],"meta":["April 2020Human Behavior and Emerging Technologies
