{"id":"333645466_Order_Acceptance_and_Scheduling_Problem_A_Proposed_Formulation_and_the_Comparison_with_the_Literature","abstract":"In classical scheduling problem, it is assumed that all orders must be processed. In the order acceptance and scheduling (OAS) problem, some orders are rejected due to limited capacity. In make-to-order production environment, in which the OAS problem occurs, accepting all orders may cause overloads, delay in deliveries and unsatisfied customers. Oğuz et al. (2010) introduced the OAS problem with sequence-dependent setup times and release dates. In this paper, we propose a new mixed integer programming formulation with O(n2) decision variables and O(n2) constraints for the same problem. We conduct a computational analysis comparing the performance of our formulation with Oğuz et al. (2010) formulation. We use the benchmark instances, which are available in the literature. We observe that our formulation can solve all the instances up to 50 orders in a reasonable time, while Oğuz et al. (2010) formulation can solve only the instances with 10 orders in the same time limit.","authors":["Papatya Sevgin Bicakci","Imdat Kara"],"meta":["June 2019","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-20494-5_29","In book: Advances in Manufacturing, Production Management and Process Control, Proceedings of the AHFE 2019 International Conference on Human Aspects of Advanced Manufacturing, and the AHFE International Conference on Advanced Production Management and Process Control, July 24-28, 2019, Washington D.C., USA (pp.310-316)"],"references":["283467332_MP_or_not_MP_that_is_the_question","245315381_Order_selection_and_scheduling_with_leadtime_flexibility","319568798_Exact_and_heuristic_algorithms_for_order_acceptance_and_scheduling_with_sequence-dependent_setup_times","315901490_A_biogeography-based_optimization_algorithm_for_order_acceptance_and_scheduling","286637864_Resource-constrained_scheduling_with_hard_due_windows_and_rejection_penalties","280091522_Maximising_profit_for_multiple-product_single-period_single-machine_manufacturing_under_sequential_set-up_constraints_that_depend_on_lot_size","222299738_Pricing_and_scheduling_decisions_with_leadtime_flexibility","220472248_Exact_algorithms_for_a_generalization_of_the_order_acceptance_and_scheduling_problem_in_a_single-machine_environment","220469845_A_tabu_search_algorithm_for_order_acceptance_and_scheduling","220289941_Order_acceptance_and_scheduling_A_taxonomy_and_review","46487204_Order_acceptance_and_scheduling_decisions_in_make-to-order_systems","4941091_The_selection_and_scheduling_of_textile_orders_with_due_dates"]}
