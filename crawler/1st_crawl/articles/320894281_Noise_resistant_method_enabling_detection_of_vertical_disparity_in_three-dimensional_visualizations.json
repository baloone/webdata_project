{"id":"320894281_Noise_resistant_method_enabling_detection_of_vertical_disparity_in_three-dimensional_visualizations","abstract":"Computer programs used for three-dimensional visualizations of phenomena occurring within the electromagnetic field do not have built-in diagnostic tools allowing to verify the quality of the obtained view. The image presented during the simulation may contain a variety of artifacts. The anomaly most often identified in three-dimensional images is vertical disparity. Detection of the above mentioned image artifact requires to conduct time-consuming or noise-sensitive calculations. This paper presents modification of known vertical disparity detection method, based on the process of binary patterns matching. The modification includes the sliding window mechanism. This approach allows to analyze image quality with the exclusion of noises generated by binary pattern matching process which is implemented in the basic sense.","authors":["Michał Kowalczyk","Piotr Napieralski"],"meta":["September 2017","DOI:10.1109/ISEF.2017.8090694","Conference: 18th International Symposium on Electromagnetic Fields in Mechatronics, Electrical and Electronic Engineering (ISEF) 2017At: Lodz, Poland, Poland","Project: System wsparcia procesów preprodukcji, produkcji i postprodukcji filmu w zakresie digitalizacji, przetwarzania, bezpiecznej długoterminowej archiwizacji oraz inteligentnego dostępu do treści"],"references":["313752818_Disparity_detection_in_three-dimensional_scenes_implementing_virtual_reality","235919766_Visualization_Method_Of_Magnetic_Fields_With_Dynamic_Particle_Systems","303785094_Effective_client-side_object_detection_method_on_Android_platform","236173354_Numerical_solid_modeling_of_3-D_intelligent_comb_drive_accelerometer_structure_-_Mechanical_problems","226162978_The_Advanced_Methods_of_Interaction_and_Data_Analyze_in_the_Visualization_System_for_Electromagnetic_Fields"]}
