{"id":"324178376_Multi-Layered_Abstraction-Based_Controller_Synthesis_for_Continuous-Time_Systems","abstract":"We present multi-layered abstraction-based controller synthesis, which extends standard abstraction-based controller synthesis (ABCS) algorithms for continuous-time control systems by simultaneously maintaining several \"layers\" of abstract systems with decreasing precision. The resulting abstract multi-layered controller uses the coarsest abstraction whenever this is feasible, and dynamically adjusts the precision---by moving to a more precise abstraction and back to a coarser abstraction---based on the structure of the given control problem. Abstract multi-layered controllers can be refined to controllers with non-uniform resolution using feedback refinement relations established between each abstract layer and the concrete system, resulting in a sound ABCS method. We provide multi-layered controller synthesis algorithms for reachability, safety, and generalized Büchi specifications; our approach can be generalized to any ω-regular objective. Our algorithms are complete relative to single-layered synthesis on the finest layer. We empirically demonstrate that multi-layered synthesis can outperform standard (single-layer) ABCS algorithms on a number of examples, despite the additional cost of constructing multiple abstract systems.","authors":["Kyle Hsu","Rupak Majumdar","Kaushik Mallik","Anne-Kathrin Schmuck"],"meta":["April 2018","DOI:10.1145/3178126.3178143","Conference: the 21st International Conference"],"references":["311863946_Optimized_State_Space_Grids_for_Abstractions","273447079_Feedback_Refinement_Relations_for_the_Synthesis_of_Symbolic_Controllers","254054660_Safety_Controller_Synthesis_for_Switched_Systems_Using_Multi-Scale_Symbolic_Models","225734990_Counterexample-Guided_Abstraction_Refinement","224085255_Approximately_Bisimilar_Symbolic_Models_for_Incrementally_Stable_Switched_Systems","221422256_Synthesis_of_switching_controllers_using_approximately_bisimilar_multiscale_abstractions","220997507_Abstract_Interpretation_A_Unified_Lattice_Model_for_Static_Analysis_of_Programs_by_Construction_or_Approximation_of_Fixpoints","220994421_On_the_Synthesis_of_Discrete_Controllers_for_Timed_Systems_An_Extended_Abstract","313427501_Modal_mu-Calculi","301282045_SCOTS_A_Tool_for_the_Synthesis_of_Symbolic_Controllers","295932057_Safety_Controller_Synthesis_for_Incrementally_Stable_Switched_Systems_Using_Multiscale_Symbolic_Models","268065846_Adaptive_and_Sequential_Gridding_Procedures_for_the_Abstraction_and_Verification_of_Stochastic_Processes","248675924_Verification_and_Control_of_Hybrid_Systems_A_Symbolic_Approach","237128841_The_Temporal_Logic_of_Reactive_and_Concurrent_Systems_Safety","225170994_Counterexample-Guided_Control","221421814_Discrete-State_Abstractions_of_Nonlinear_Systems_Using_Multi-resolution_Quantizer","220693189_The_temporal_logic_of_reactive_and_concurrent_systems_-_specification","4246541_Multiresolution_approach_for_motion_planning_under_differential_constraints","3510377_Tree_automata_mu-calculus_and_determinacy","3032502_Towards_a_Multiresolution_Approach_to_Linear_Control"]}
