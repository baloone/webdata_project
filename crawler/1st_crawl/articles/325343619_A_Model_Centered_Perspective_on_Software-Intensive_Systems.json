{"id":"325343619_A_Model_Centered_Perspective_on_Software-Intensive_Systems","abstract":"The aim of this paper contributing to resurrect research interest in conceptual modeling as a means for designing and producing software-intensive systems, as there is still no comprehensive and consistent use of conceptual modeling in practice. The idea is to see any software and information system as a construct consisting of model handlers (model consumers and/or producers). This leads to the paradigm of \"Model Centered Architecture\", which treats all processes, as well as the data they process, as instances of models. These models in turn are instances of meta-models, described using a particular domain specific modeling language (DSML), and represented using a corresponding domain specific representation language. Consequently, all system interfaces are defined through models (via an appropriate DSML) as well. The paper introduces the relevant MCA concepts and sketches open research questions in this field.","authors":["Heinrich C. Mayr","Judith Michael","Vladimir A.
