{"id":"353458800_Students_as_Designers_of_Augmented_Reality_Impact_on_Learning_and_Motivation_in_Computer_Science","abstract":"In this study, we report findings from the PCBuildAR project, in which students developed augmented reality (AR) artifacts following a guided design-based learning (DBL) approach. Sixty-two students participated in the study and were either in their first year to learn about computer science or were more experienced computer science students. In terms of learning performance, only the first-year students benefited from our guided DBL approach. In contrast, the experienced students were highly motivated to learn computer science not only immediately after the intervention, but also in the long term. For first-year students, this effect was only evident directly after the intervention. Overall, the guided DBL design proved to be effective for both motivation and learning, especially for younger students. For older learners, a better balance between guidance and autonomy is recommended.","authors":["Josef Buchner","Michael Kerres"],"meta":["July 2021Multimodal Technologies and Interaction 5(8):41","DOI:10.3390/mti5080041","Project: PCBuildAR - Augmented Reality Cards for Computer Science Education"],"references":["347623751_Problem-_Project-_and_Design-Based_Learning_Their_Relationship_to_Teaching_Science_Technology_and_Engineering_in_School","344656694_Understanding_design-based_learning_context_and_the_associated_emotional_experience","344153518_Applying_Instructional_Design_Principles_on_Augmented_Reality_Cards_for_Computer_Science_Education","341190691_Children's_Emotions_in_Design-Based_Learning_a_Systematic_Review","340508212_Intrinsic_and_extrinsic_motivation_from_a_self-determination_theory_perspective_Definitions_theory_practices_and_future_directions","343739670_Exploring_the_impact_of_video_making_on_students'_writing_skills","343226514_The_research_we_have_is_not_the_research_we_need","341674495_How_do_pedagogical_approaches_affect_the_impact_of_augmented_reality_on_education_A_meta-analysis_and_research_synthesis","338828134_Forms_of_inquiry-based_science_instruction_and_their_relations_with_learning_outcomes_evidence_from_high_and_low-performing_education_systems","338493303_Making_more_of_games_Cultivating_perspective-taking_through_game_design"]}
