{"id":"340111033_Recent_advances_in_small_object_detection_based_on_deep_learning_A_review","abstract":"Small object detection is a challenging problem in computer vision. It has been widely applied in defense military, transportation, industry, etc. To facilitate in-depth understanding of small object detection, we comprehensively review the existing small object detection methods based on deep learning from five aspects, including multi-scale feature learning, data augmentation, training strategy, context-based detection and GAN-based detection. Then, we thoroughly analyze the performance of some typical small object detection algorithms on popular datasets, such as MS-COCO, PASCAL-VOC. Finally, the possible research directions in the future are pointed out from five perspectives: emerging small object detection datasets and benchmarks, multi-task joint learning and optimization, information transmission, weakly supervised small object detection methods and framework for small object detection task.","authors":["Kang Tong","Yiquan Wu","Fei Zhou"],"meta":["March 2020Image and Vision Computing 97:103910","DOI:10.1016/j.imavis.2020.103910"],"references":["338171640_Augmentation_for_small_object_detection","336934637_Deep_Learning_for_Generic_Object_Detection_A_Survey","335648054_A_Survey_of_Deep_Learning-Based_Object_Detection","335239949_M2Det_A_Single-Shot_Object_Detector_Based_on_Multi-Level_Feature_Pyramid_Network","335056781_CornerNet_Detecting_Objects_as_Paired_Keypoints","334904435_An_Improved_Faster_R-CNN_for_Small_Object_Detection","325409414_SCAN_Semantic_Context_Aware_Network_for_Accurate_Small_Object_Detection","325025142_Facial_Landmark_Detection_A_Literature_Survey","321417928_Relation_Networks_for_Object_Detection","321180719_Single-Shot_Refinement_Neural_Network_for_Object_Detection","318813696_Recurrent_Scale_Approximation_for_Object_Detection_in_CNN","316184748_Improving_Object_Detection_With_One_Line_of_Code","311610541_Traffic-Sign_Detection_and_Classification_in_the_Wild","308191575_Gated_Bi-directional_CNN_for_Object_Detection","306357649_Semantic_Understanding_of_Scenes_Through_the_ADE20K_Dataset","301875593_T-CNN_Tubelets_With_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_Object_Detection_From_Videos","273126576_Text_Detection_and_Recognition_in_Imagery_A_Survey","338650266_MDSSD_multi-scale_deconvolutional_single_shot_detector_for_small_objects","338513352_Bottom-Up_Object_Detection_by_Grouping_Extreme_and_Center_Points","330708842_Object_Detection_With_Deep_Learning_A_Review","329743878_Structure_Inference_Net_Object_Detection_Using_Scene-Level_Context_and_Instance-Level_Relationships","329743581_Improving_Small_Object_Detection","329740280_An_Analysis_of_Scale_Invariance_in_Object_Detection_-_SNIP","328241690_Cascade_Mask_Generation_Framework_for_Fast_Small_Object_Detection","327713960_Small_Object_Detection_Using_Deep_Feature_Pyramid_Networks_19th_Pacific-Rim_Conference_on_Multimedia_Hefei_China_September_21-22_2018_Proceedings_Part_III","325585977_Mask_R-CNN","324423720_Feature-fused_SSD_fast_detection_for_small_objects","323690585_Computer_Vision_and_Deep_Learning_Techniques_for_Pedestrian_Detection_and_Tracking_A_Survey","322057947_Spatial_Memory_for_Context_Reasoning_in_Object_Detection","320964522_RON_Reverse_Connection_with_Objectness_Prior_Networks_for_Object_Detection","320964510_Feature_Pyramid_Networks_for_Object_Detection","320964426_Perceptual_Generative_Adversarial_Networks_for_Small_Object_Detection","319770820_Histograms_of_Oriented_Gradients_for_Human_Detection","319770430_Rich_feature_hierarchies_for_accurate_object_detection_and_semantic_segmentation","319575316_A_closer_look_Small_object_detection_in_faster_R-CNN","311611062_Inside-Outside_Net_Detecting_Objects_in_Context_with_Skip_Pooling_and_Recurrent_Neural_Networks","311609212_HyperNet_Towards_Accurate_Region_Proposal_Generation_and_Joint_Object_Detection","308277265_A_Unified_Multi-scale_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Network_for_Fast_Object_Detection","303409473_R-FCN_Object_Detection_via_Region-based_Fully_Convolutional_Networks","303301802_Going_Deeper_into_Action_Recognition_A_Survey","301848540_Image_Captioning_and_Visual_Question_Answering_Based_on_Attributes_and_Their_Related_External_Knowledge","301836656_Attentive_Contexts_for_Object_Detection","301316962_Text_Detection_Tracking_and_Recognition_in_Video_A_Comprehensive_Survey","299570598_A_Survey_on_Object_Detection_in_Optical_Remote_Sensing_Images","287250476_Instance-aware_Semantic_Segmentation_via_Multi-task_Network_Cascades","284002288_A_Survey_on_Representation-based_Classification_and_Detection_in_Hyperspectral_Remote_Sensing_Imagery","277722488_Faster_R-CNN_Towards_Real-Time_Object_Detection_with_Region_Proposal_Networks","275156849_A_Survey_on_Face_Detection_in_the_wild_past_present_and_future","271659753_SUN_Database_Exploring_a_Large_Collection_of_Scene_Categories","269273538_Composite_Discriminant_Factor_analysis","266560944_Facial_Feature_Point_Detection_A_Comprehensive_Survey","263237865_Spatial_Pyramid_Pooling_in_Deep_Convolutional_Networks_for_Visual_Recognition","261121682_Are_we_ready_for_autonomous_driving_The_KITTI_Vision_Benchmark_Suite","260711674_Looking_at_Vehicles_on_the_Road_A_Survey_of_Vision-Based_Vehicle_Detection_Tracking_and_Behavior_Analysis","260359456_Vision-Based_Traffic_Sign_Detection_and_Analysis_for_Intelligent_Driver_Assistance_Systems_Perspectives_and_Survey"]}
