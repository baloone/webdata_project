{"id":"336411760_The_Effect_of_A_Flipped_Classroom_on_Students'_Achievements_Academic_Engagement_and_Satisfaction_Levels","abstract":"In this study, a flipped classroom was compared with blended learning and face-to-face learning environments\nand the aim was to identify the effect of these learning environments on students’ achievements, academic\nengagement and satisfaction levels. Based on this aim, one control and two experimental groups were formed.\nThe students in Experiment-I learned the theoretical aspect of the course through the materials in the\nonline learning environment which were prepared prior to the class study time in context with the “flipped\nclassroom”. The students in Experiment-II learned the theoretical aspect of the course in the classroom in\naccordance with the blended learning model and fulfilled active learning activities out of class study time.\nThe students in the control group learned the theoretical aspect of the course in the classroom according to\nthe current curriculum and conducted active learning activities at their homes. It was found that the scores\nfor the students in the experimental groups with regard to academic achievement and engagement were\nhigher than the scores for those in the control group and the differences between the groups were statistically\nsignificant. It was revealed that the students were also generally satisfied with the flipped classroom.","authors":["Tarik Talan","S.
