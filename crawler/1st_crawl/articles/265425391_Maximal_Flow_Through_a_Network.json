{"id":"265425391_Maximal_Flow_Through_a_Network","abstract":"Introduction. The problem discussed in this paper was formulated by T. Harris as follows:\n“Consider a rail network connecting two cities by way of a number of intermediate cities, where each link of the network has a number assigned to it representing its capacity. Assuming a steady state condition, find a maximal flow from one given city to the other.”","authors":["L.R.jun. Ford","D.R.
