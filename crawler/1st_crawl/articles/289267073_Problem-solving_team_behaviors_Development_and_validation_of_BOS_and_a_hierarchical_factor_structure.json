{"id":"289267073_Problem-solving_team_behaviors_Development_and_validation_of_BOS_and_a_hierarchical_factor_structure","abstract":"This is among the first studies to develop a typology of performance-relevant team member behaviors from actual observations of intact teams (N = 94) completing a variety of problem-solving tasks. Through a critical incident analysis, behavioral observation scales (BOS) were developed using confirmatory factor analysis. The correlation between BOS and team performance was significant. The typology supports and adds to previous typologies of teamwork behavior. Subsequent cross-validation of the BOS involving 176 team members provided further support for the BOS developed. Next, we used our data to psychometrically evaluate Stevens and Campion's hierarchical factor structure. Hierarchical confirmatory factor analysis provided support for Stevens and Campion's model.","authors":["S. Taggar","Travor C.
