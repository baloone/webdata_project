{"id":"222305559_A_Partial_K-Arboretum_of_Graphs_With_Bounded_Treewidth","abstract":"The notion of treewidth has seen to be a powerful vehicle for many graph algorithmic studies. This survey paper wants to give an overview of many classes of graphs that can be seen to have a uniform upper bound on the treewidth of graphs in the class. Also, some mutual relations between such classes are discussed.","authors":["Hans L.
