{"id":"249898383_Suffix_Tree_for_a_Sliding_Window_An_Overview","abstract":"The suffix tree is a very powerful data structure developed originally for string matching and string searching. It has found many applications over the time and some of them belong into the data compression field. Many of these applications need a suffix tree built for a sliding window and t here exist two clever algorithms by Fiala and Greene and by Larsson that make this possible. However, as we show both approaches have flawed proofs. We remedy this situation both by explaining a simple alternative algorithm and giving a correct proof.","authors":["M.
