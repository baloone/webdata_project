{"id":"328390995_Geographic_information_technology_usage_in_developing_countries_-_A_case_study_in_Mozambique","abstract":"Geographic information technologies (GIT) have matured, have become pervasive throughout many types of organizations over recent decades and gained a wide range of attention in diverse sectors of society. The goal of this paper is to identify the main drivers and uses of GIT in organizations and to give an overview of GIT uses in developing countries with a focus on a case study developed for Mozambique by analyzing the results of a survey of 123 Mozambican organizations that are current GIT users. The results show that the main drivers behind are compatibility, complexity, competitive pressure, donor pressure, government policy, intention to adopt, innovation, relative advantage, security, and technology competence. Organizations of the public and private sectors use GIT for customer/resource/risk management, decision support, education, research, monitoring, prediction, simulation, suitability analysis, sustainability, use and access.","authors":["Nelson Amade","M.
