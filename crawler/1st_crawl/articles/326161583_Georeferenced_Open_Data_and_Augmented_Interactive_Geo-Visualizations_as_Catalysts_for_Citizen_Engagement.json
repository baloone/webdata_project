{"id":"326161583_Georeferenced_Open_Data_and_Augmented_Interactive_Geo-Visualizations_as_Catalysts_for_Citizen_Engagement","abstract":"Citizen engagement figures prominently on political agendas around the world. In this context, high hopes are pinned to open government, open data and ICT tools. At the same time, there are fears of a widening digital divide, where large groups of society are in danger of being excluded from societal processes, for example due to having difficulties in using the online tools provided. In this paper, we propose an approach that has the potential to address many key issues in this context (e.g. accessibility, complexity, engagement). It relies on space and time as common integrators, and uses interactive augmented geo-visualizations to facilitate citizen engagement. We report on key challenges that need to be overcome to realize this approach and on initial progress towards this goal. We describe a set of prototypical tools aimed at supporting citizen engagement in the envisioned way, and discuss the approach as well as its potentials, issues and challenges in detail. Initial experiences and results indicate that our approach is not only technically feasible but it can also empower citizens to more effectively engage with societal and governmental processes.","authors":["Thore Fechner","Christian Kray"],"meta":["October 2014JeDEM - eJournal of eDemocracy and Open Government 6(1):14-35","DOI:10.29379/jedem.v6i1.283"],"references":["326164108_Open_the_changing_relation_between_citizens_public_administration_and_political_authority","262408368_Reviewing_the_quality_of_awareness_support_in_collaborative_applications","262165051_Enhancing_community_awareness_of_and_participation_in_local_heritage_with_a_mobile_application","258182600_Open_Government_Connecting_Vision_and_Voice","253372300_Maps_as_social_constructions_Power_communication_and_visualization","251313357_Motivations_driving_government_adoption_of_the_Geoweb","249725316_Bad_Civil_Society","249500357_Introduction_Exploring_citizenship_participation_and_accountability","235737722_Citizens'_attitudes_toward_Open_Government_and_Government_20","234101810_Exploiting_single-user_web_applications_for_shared_editing_-_A_generic_transformation_approach","232838693_Enabling_collaborative_geoinformation_access_and_decision-making_through_a_natural_multimodal_interface","228389082_Cartography_Maps_20","227655547_From_Users_and_Choosers_to_Makers_and_Shapers_Repositioning_Participation_in_Social_Policy1","224285723_Information_Visualization_Perception_for_Design_Second_Edition","221568777_Place-Its_A_Study_of_Location-Based_Reminders_on_Mobile_Phones","221367739_Deep_hypertext_with_embedded_revision_control_implemented_in_regular_expressions","220879590_On_the_localness_of_user-generated_content","220650485_Leveraging_the_potential_of_geospatial_annotations_for_collaboration_A_communication_theory_perspective","220650004_The_convergence_of_GIS_and_social_media_Challenges_for_GIScience","220649606_GIS_as_media","324404129_The_Civic_Culture_Political_Attitudes_and_Democracy_in_Five_Nations","314828834_Location-based_notification_as_a_general-purpose_service","313618321_A_ladder_of_citizen_participation","307175251_Induction_of_Decision_Trees","305190867_Zivilgesellschaft_und_Staat_in_der_Demokratie","305190601_Die_dunklen_Seiten_der_Zivilgesellschaft","285662551_The_open_government_principle_Applying_the_right_to_know_under_the_constitution","281562743_Alternative_and_Activist_New_Media","280079892_A_tetradic_analysis_of_GIS_and_society_using_McLuhan's_law_of_the_media","280079769_GIS_Cartography_and_the_''Third_Culture''_Geographic_Imaginations_in_the_Computer_Age","275513229_Public_administration_and_citizen_satisfaction_with_democracy_Cross-national_evidence","268262309_THE_DOMAIN_OF_PUBLIC_ADMINISTRATION","267242755_Argumentation_Mapping_in_Collaborative_Spatial_Decision_Making","263265957_New_spatial_media_new_knowledge_politics","262365773_Leveraging_the_contributory_potential_of_user_feedback","262286536_Integrating_on-demand_fact-checking_with_public_dialogue","262241864_Tweet_acts_how_constituents_lobby_congress_via_Twitter","259115890_Social_Media_Supporting_Political_Deliberation_Across_Multiple_Public_Spheres_Towards_Depolarization","256013268_The_New_Ambiguity_of_'Open_Government'","245662992_Civil_Society_and_Political_Theory","236771351_A_Survey_of_Decision_Tree_Classiifer_Methodology_155","236704475_Civil_Society_and_the_Collapse_of_the_Weimar_Republic","228770123_Cartography_Performative_Participatory_Political","228155429_Government_Data_and_the_Invisible_Hand","227624240_Public_Participation_Geographic_Information_Systems_A_Literature_Review_and_Framework","220879478_Supporting_reflective_public_thought_with_considerit","220877468_Real-Time_Collaborative_Coding_in_a_Web_IDE","220543019_Improved_Use_of_Continuous_Attributes_in_C45","220144110_A_beast_in_the_field_The_Google_Maps_mashup_as_GIS2","216266431_Analysis_of_online_public_participatory_GIS_applications_with_respect_to_the_differences_between_the_US_and_Europe","51993052_Public_Deliberation_Discursive_Participation_and_Citizen_Engagement_A_Review_of_the_Empirical_Literature","48208522_Computer_Support_for_Discussions_in_Spatial_Planning","47797661_Geovisualisierung_zur_raumlichen_Entscheidungsunterstutzung","46559686_Evaluating_Community_Engagement_through_Argumentation_Maps-A_Public_Participation_GIS_Case_Study","44830498_Making_Rights_Real_Exploring_Citizenship_Participation_and_Accountability"]}
