{"id":"280912075_On_Percolation_and_NP-Hardness","abstract":"We consider the robustness of computational hardness of problems whose input\nis obtained by applying independent random deletions to worst-case instances.\nFor some classical $NP$-hard problems on graphs, such as Coloring,\nVertex-Cover, and Hamiltonicity, we examine the complexity of these problems\nwhen edges (or vertices) of an arbitrary graph are deleted independently with\nprobability $1-p > 0$. We prove that for $n$-vertex graphs, these problems\nremain as hard as in the worst-case, as long as $p > \\frac{1}{n^{1-\\epsilon}}$\nfor arbitrary $\\epsilon \\in (0,1)$, unless $NP \\subseteq BPP$.\nWe also prove hardness results for Constraint Satisfaction Problems, where\nrandom deletions are applied to clauses or variables, as well as the Subset-Sum\nproblem, where items of a given instance are deleted at random.","authors":["Daniel Reichman","Igor Shinkar"],"meta":["March 2019Random Structures and Algorithms 54(6794)","DOI:10.1002/rsa.20772","SourcearXiv"],"references":["321245859_Resilience_of_the_Internet_to_Random_Breakdowns","277603448_Packing_Counting_and_Covering_Hamilton_cycles_in_random_directed_graphs","316806492_Grundlehren_der_mathematischen_Wissenschaften","314053102_Wiley-Interscience_Series_in_Discrete_Mathematics_and_Optimization","313609388_On_the_evolution_of_random_graphs","311612446_On_Coloring_Random_Subgraphs_of_a_Fixed_Graph","288945035_Wiley-Interscience_Series_in_Discrete_Mathematics_and_Optimization","286097895_Random_Graphs","285833864_Smoothed_Analysis_of_Local_Search_for_the_Maximum-Cut_Problem","279810210_Decay_of_correlations_and_inference_in_graphical_models","269200003_Random_Sampling_in_Cut_Flow_and_Network_Design_Problems","266350430_Introduction_to_Ramsey_Spaces","265359448_On_the_Evolution_of_Random_Graphs","262355986_Approximating_s-t_minimum_cuts_in_O_n_2_time","248321322_Vertex_Cover_Might_be_Hard_to_Approximate_to_within_2"]}
