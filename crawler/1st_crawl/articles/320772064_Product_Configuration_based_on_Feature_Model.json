{"id":"320772064_Product_Configuration_based_on_Feature_Model","abstract":"The approaches of product configuration based on feature are about how to select features from a feature model based on specific domain requirements and stakeholdersâ€™ goals. Although the literature on this topic has gained most importance in Academic and industrial fields, only little effort is dedicated to compare and analyze them. In order to address this shortcoming and to provide a basis for more structured research on feature modeling in the future, we first build a framework model to describe model structure, dependency management, automated support, configuration approaches and so on shared in the approaches family. Secondly, we understand and classify different configuration method based on the framework. Meanwhile we analyze the commonalities and variabilities among different approaches.","authors":["Zhijuan Zhan","Yunjiao Zhan","Mingyu Huang","Yumei Liu"],"meta":["June 2018Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-69096-4_15","Conference: International Conference on Intelligent and Interactive Systems and Applications"],"references":["225391352_Supporting_Multiple_Perspectives_in_Feature-based_Configuration","224259627_A_Toolset_for_Feature-Based_Configuration_Workflows","223760542_Automated_analysis_of_feature_models_20_years_later_A_literature_review","221389815_Using_Constraint_Programming_to_Reason_on_Feature_Models","221158966_Integrating_Quality_Modeling_with_Feature_Modeling_in_Software_Product_Lines","278656388_Automated_Analysis_of_Stateful_Feature_Models","221591101_The_Complexity_of_Theorem-Proving_Procedures","220789840_A_Toolset_for_Feature-Based_Configuration_Workflows","220693462_Software_Product_Line_Engineering_Foundations_Principles_and_Techniques","220690138_Foundations_of_Constraint_Satisfaction","220542434_Staged_configuration_through_specialization_and_multilevel_configuration_of_feature_models","4277635_Automating_Product-Line_Variant_Selection_for_Mobile_Devices"]}
