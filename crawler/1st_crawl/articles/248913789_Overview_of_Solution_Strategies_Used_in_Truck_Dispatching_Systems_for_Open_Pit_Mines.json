{"id":"248913789_Overview_of_Solution_Strategies_Used_in_Truck_Dispatching_Systems_for_Open_Pit_Mines","abstract":"This paper deals with dispatching systems in open-pit mines. It illustrates the different strategies that exist for solving the dispatching problem and analyses the advantages and disadvantages of these strategies. Moreover, the most important elements that should be part of the dispatching system in the future are highlighted.","authors":["Michel Gamache","St√©phane Alarie"],"meta":["March 2002International Journal of Surface Mining Reclamation and Environment 16(1):59-76","DOI:10.1076/ijsm.16.1.59.3408","Project: Mine Planning"],"references":["279574988_TRUCK_DISPATCHING_AND_SIMULATION_METHODS_IN_OPEN-PIT_OPERATIONS","221704741_Introduction_To_Operations_Research","313761868_Dynamic_vehicle_routing_and_dispatching","313199471_On_improving_truckshovel_productivity_in_open_pit_mines","313084891_A_comparative_review_of_alternative_algorithms_for_the_dynamic_vehicle_allocation_problem","298157610_Shovel-truck_productivity_and_efficiency_studies_for_overburden_removal_in_an_open-pit_coal_mine","286668867_Estimation_of_large_open_pit_haulage_truck_requirements","284054116_Optimum_dispatching_algorithm_for_Anshan_open-pit_mine","280858830_COMPUTER-BASED_TRUCK_DISPATCHING","280858376_AUTOMATED_OPEN-PIT_TRUCK_DISPATCHING_AT_TYRONE","279575082_ANALYSIS_OF_OPEN-PIT_TRUCK_HAULAGE_SYSTEM_BY_USE_OF_A_COMPUTER_MODEL","269405785_A_Nonpreemptive_Goal_Programming_Approach_to_Truck_Dispatching_in_Open_Pit_Mines","269392061_BEdisp_-_A_computer-based_truck_dispatching_system_for_small-medium_scale_mining_operations","249030417_Real-time_truck_dispatching_using_a_transportation_algorithm","249030225_Truck_dispatch_computer_simulation_in_Aitik_open_pit_mine","243701311_Design_and_operational_issues_in_AGV-served_manufacturing_systems","236390712_Computer-based_dispatching_in_mines_with_concurrent_operating_objectives","233470958_An_application_of_closed_queueing_networks_theory_in_truck-shovel_systems","233085099_ARENA_simulation_model_for_truck-shovel_operation_in_despatching_and_non-despatching_modes","233047786_Review_of_computer-based_truck_dispatching_strategies_for_surface_mining_operations","232829518_Towards_integrated_production_planning_and_truck_dispatching_in_open_pit_mines","229396985_Truck_and_shovel_dispatching_rules_assessment_using_simulation","229377474_A_methodology_for_the_optimum_control_of_shovel_and_truck_operations_in_open-pit_mining","223158878_A_Review_of_Research_on_AGVS_Vehicle_Management","35941526_The_development_of_assignment_procedures_for_semi-automated_truckshovel_systems","4940811_Perspectives_on_practical_aspects_of_truck_routing_and_scheduling"]}
