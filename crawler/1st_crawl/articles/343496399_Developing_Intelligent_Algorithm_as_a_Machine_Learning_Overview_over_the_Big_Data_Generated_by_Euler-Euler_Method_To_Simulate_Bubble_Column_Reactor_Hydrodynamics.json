{"id":"343496399_Developing_Intelligent_Algorithm_as_a_Machine_Learning_Overview_over_the_Big_Data_Generated_by_Euler-Euler_Method_To_Simulate_Bubble_Column_Reactor_Hydrodynamics","abstract":"A bubble column reactor is simulated by a combination of Eulerâ€“Euler and adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) method to develop an understanding of the machine learning (ML) technique in describing complex behavior of multiphase flow in bubble column reactors and for deep learning of input and output connections. In the validation stage of simulations, an intelligent bubble column is created that uses artificial intelligence nodes or neural network nodes, and the results of prediction indicated excellent agreement with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation results. The hydrodynamic characteristics of the air bubbles and the amount of stress inside the bubble column reactor are used as the output of the ANFIS method. This study showed that when a three-dimensional bubble column is trained by a ML method, a similar CFD simulation can be created, which is independent of CFD source data. This type of smart simulation also enables us to avoid repeating the simulations with CFD methods that are time-consuming and computationally expensive for process modeling and optimization.","authors":["Meisam Babanezhad","Ali Taghvaie Nakhjiri","Mashallah Rezakazemi","Saeed Shirazian"],"meta":["August 2020ACS Omega XXXX(XXX)","DOI:10.1021/acsomega.0c02784"],"references":["339278677_Prediction_of_Nanofluid_Temperature_Inside_the_Cavity_by_Integration_of_Grid_Partition_Clustering_Categorization_of_a_Learning_Structure_with_the_Fuzzy_System","338995471_Prediction_of_flow_characteristics_in_the_bubble_column_reactor_by_the_artificial_pheromone-based_communication_of_biological_ants","338554274_Prediction_of_Flow_Characteristics_in_the_Bubble_Column_Reactor_by_the_Artificial_Pheromone-Based_Communication_of_Biological_Ants","338105459_Prediction_of_fluid_pattern_in_a_shear_flow_on_intelligent_neural_nodes_using_ANFIS_and_LBM","341467479_Fluid_Velocity_Prediction_Inside_Bubble_Column_Reactor_Using_ANFIS_Algorithm_Based_on_CFD_Input_Data","337276956_Simulation_of_a_Bubble-Column_Reactor_by_Three-Dimensional_CFD_Multidimension-_and_Function-Adaptive_Network-Based_Fuzzy_Inference_System","337120553_Flow_visualization_and_analysis_of_thermal_distribution_for_the_nanofluid_by_the_integration_of_fuzzy_c-means_clustering_ANFIS_structure_and_CFD_methods","328544419_Liquid-Phase_Chemical_Reactors_Development_of_3D_Hybrid_Model_Based_on_CFD-Adaptive_Network-Based_Fuzzy_Inference_System","321801538_On_the_scale-up_criteria_for_bubble_columns","320307140_Lattice_Boltzmann_method_based_study_of_the_heat_transfer_augmentation_associated_with_Cuwater_nanofluid_in_a_channel_with_surface_mounted_blocks"]}
