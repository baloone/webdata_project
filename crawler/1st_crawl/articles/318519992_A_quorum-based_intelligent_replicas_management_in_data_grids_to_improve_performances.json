{"id":"318519992_A_quorum-based_intelligent_replicas_management_in_data_grids_to_improve_performances","abstract":"Today, data replication is widely used in large-scale systems such as data grids to meet the requirements and challenges of managing these huge amounts of data. Indeed, replication is used to reduce the data access cost and access latency, to improve availability and performance, and to ensure reliability in grids. Most proposed replication strategies deal read-only case when accessing data, few approaches studies data consistency when the updates are allowed in data grids. In this paper, we present a contribution using a quorum-based management of replicas approach to maintain the consistency of these replicas, whose goal is to minimize quorum sizes to decrease replication costs and improve performances.","authors":["Farouk Bouharaoua","Ghalem Belalem"],"meta":["July 2017Multiagent and Grid Systems 13(2):143-161","DOI:10.3233/MGS-170265","Project: Automatic image annotation"],"references":["259007097_A_load_balancing_strategy_for_replica_consistency_maintenance_in_data_grid_systems","228445165_A_Comparative_Study_of_Cluster-based_Data_Replication_Techniques_for_MANETs","224212798_Replica_Selection_in_Data_Grids_Using_Preconditioning_of_Decision_Attributes_by_K-means_Clustering_K-RSDG","280090106_Dynamic_Data_Replication-Driven_Model_in_Data_Grids","273121057_An_Arbitrary_2D_Structured_Replica_Control_Protocol","270735454_Data_Replication_Approach_with_Consistency_Guarantee_for_Data_Grid","261242001_Replica_control_protocol_Triple_Quorum_Replication_TQR_in_Data_Grid","260707481_The_Grid_Protocol_A_High_Performance_Scheme_for_Maintaining_Replicated_Data","259132376_Dynamic_replica_placement_and_selection_strategies_in_data_grids-A_comprehensive_survey","225144059_Dynamic_hybrid_replication_effectively_combining_tree_and_grid_topology"]}
