One of the most important hurdles in controlling the spread of this disease is the inefficiency and lack of medical tests. Computed tomography (CT) scans are promising in providing accurate and fast detection of COVID-19. However, determining COVID-19 requires highly trained radiologists and suffers from inter-observer variability. To remedy these limitations, this paper introduces an automatic methodology based on an ensemble of deep transfer learning for the detection of COVID-19.MethodsA total of 15 pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) architectures: EfficientNets(B0-B5), NasNetLarge, NasNetMobile, InceptionV3, ResNet-50, SeResnet 50, Xception, DenseNet121, ResNext50 and Inception_resnet_v2 are used and then fine-tuned on the target task. After that, we built an ensemble method based on majority voting of the best combination of deep transfer learning outputs to further improve the recognition performance. We have used a publicly available dataset of CT scans, which consists of 349 CT scans labeled as being positive for COVID-19 and 397 negative COVID-19 CT scans that are normal or contain other types of lung diseases.ResultsThe experimental results indicate that the majority voting of 5 deep transfer learning architecture with EfficientNetB0, EfficientNetB3, EfficientNetB5, Inception_resnet_v2, and Xception has the higher results than the individual transfer learning structure and among the other models based on precision (0.857), recall (0.854) and accuracy (0.85) metrics in diagnosing COVID-19 from CT scans.Conclusion\nOur study based on an ensemble deep transfer learning system with different pre-trained CNNs architectures can work well on a publicly available dataset of CT images for the diagnosis of COVID-19 based on CT scans.","authors":["Parisa Gifani","Ahmad Shalbaf","Majid Vafaeezadeh"],"meta":["November 2020International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery 16(3)","DOI:10.1007/s11548-020-02286-w"],"references":["349577188_A_deep_learning_algorithm_using_CT_images_to_screen_for_Corona_virus_disease_COVID-19","346504343_Deep_learning-based_model_for_detecting_2019_novel_coronavirus_pneumonia_on_high-resolution_computed_tomography","341529001_A_Weakly-supervised_Framework_for_COVID-19_Classification_and_Lesion_Localization_from_Chest_CT","338601337_Classification_of_Interstitial_Lung_Abnormality_Patterns_with_an_Ensemble_of_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","338543002_A_Novel_Transfer_Learning_Based_Approach_for_Pneumonia_Detection_in_Chest_X-ray_Images","334960008_Current_applications_and_future_directions_of_deep_learning_in_musculoskeletal_radiology","326996103_Clinically_applicable_deep_learning_for_diagnosis_and_referral_in_retinal_disease","319770123_Densely_Connected_Convolutional_Networks","319415855_Predicting_Cardiovascular_Risk_Factors_from_Retinal_Fundus_Photographs_using_Deep_Learning","313857891_A_Survey_on_Deep_Learning_in_Medical_Image_Analysis","307968826_Digital_mammographic_tumor_classification_using_transfer_learning_from_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","306885833_Densely_Connected_Convolutional_Networks","305676976_Deep_learning_for_digital_pathology_image_analysis_A_comprehensive_tutorial_with_selected_use_cases","303498772_Deep_learning_as_a_tool_for_increased_accuracy_and_efficiency_of_histopathological_diagnosis","297659797_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_Medical_Image_Analysis_Fine_Tuning_or_Full_Training","221361415_ImageNet_a_Large-Scale_Hierarchical_Image_Database","341299160_Automatic_Detection_of_Tuberculosis_Related_Abnormalities_in_Chest_X-ray_Images_using_Hierarchical_Feature_Extraction_Scheme","339393396_Chest_CT_Findings_in_Coronavirus_Disease-19_COVID-19_Relationship_to_Duration_of_Infection","334981647_State-of-the-Art_Deep_Learning_in_Cardiovascular_Image_Analysis","331263677_Evolutionary_Algorithms_for_Automatic_Lung_Disease_Detection","330995650_A_neuro-heuristic_approach_for_recognition_of_lung_diseases_from_X-ray_images","329745708_Learning_Transferable_Architectures_for_Scalable_Image_Recognition","320971540_Aggregated_Residual_Transformations_for_Deep_Neural_Networks","319501512_Squeeze-and-Excitation_Networks","318671172_Learning_Transferable_Architectures_for_Scalable_Image_Recognition","312890808_Dermatologist-level_classification_of_skin_cancer_with_deep_neural_networks","311609041_Deep_Residual_Learning_for_Image_Recognition","308965018_Deep_Learning_with_Separable_Convolutions","306281834_Rethinking_the_Inception_Architecture_for_Computer_Vision","301874967_Inception-v4_Inception-ResNet_and_the_Impact_of_Residual_Connections_on_Learning","301732947_Guest_Editorial_Deep_Learning_in_Medical_Imaging_Overview_and_Future_Promise_of_an_Exciting_New_Technique","286512696_Deep_Residual_Learning_for_Image_Recognition","285648386_Rethinking_the_Inception_Architecture_for_Computer_Vision","267960550_ImageNet_Classification_with_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks"]}
