{"id":"281390706_A_Modal_Separation_Logic_for_Resource_Dynamics","abstract":"The logic of Bunched implications (BI), and its Boolean version (Boolean BI), are logics that allow us to express properties\non resources and to provide logical frameworks for the so-called separation logics. In this article, we study a new modal\nseparation logic that extends Boolean BI with two kinds of modalities, to deal with resources having dynamic properties (which\ndepend on the current state of a system) and also to capture some resource evolutions or transformations. We show how we can\nmodel concurrent processes manipulating resources, and we provide a sound and complete tableau calculus, with a counter-model\nextraction method, for proving properties expressed in this logic.","authors":["Jean-Ren√© Courtault","Didier Galmiche"],"meta":["June 2015Journal of Logic and Computation 28(4)","DOI:10.1093/logcom/exv031"],"references":["226179980_A_Calculus_and_logic_of_resources_and_processes","222555399_Systems_Modelling_via_Resources_and_Processes_Philosophy_Calculus_Semantics_and_Logic","220388029_A_Logical_and_Computational_Theory_of_Located_Resource","50413683_Exploring_the_relation_between_Intuitionistic_BI_and_Boolean_BI_An_unexpected_embedding","321515095_First-Order_Logic_and_Automated_Theorem_Proving","313550915_An_Axiomatic_Basis_of_Computer_Programming","302216331_A_Modal_BI_Logic_for_Dynamic_Resource_Properties","287829167_Formal_Aspects_of_Computing_Editorial","275166094_The_formal_strong_completeness_of_partial_monoidal_Boolean_BI","242353736_The_Semantics_and_Proof_Theory_of_the_Logic_of_Bunched_Implications","228668072_The_Semantics_of_BI_and_Resource_Tableaux","221942985_Linear_Logic","220430894_Algebraic_Laws_for_Nondeterminism_and_Concurrency","220173294_Algebra_and_logic_for_resource-based_systems_modelling","50853886_Tableaux_and_Resource_Graphs_for_Separation_Logic","38373144_The_Logic_of_Bunched_Implications"]}
