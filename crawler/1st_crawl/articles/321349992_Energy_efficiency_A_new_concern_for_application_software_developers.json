{"id":"321349992_Energy_efficiency_A_new_concern_for_application_software_developers","abstract":"THE PREVALENCE AND ubiquity of mobile computing platforms, such as smartphones, tablets, smart watches, and smart glasses, have changed the way people use and interact with software. In particular, these platforms share a common yet challenging requirement: They are battery-driven. As users interact with them, they tend to be less available, since even simple, well-optimized operations (for example, texting a friend) consume energy. At the same time, wasteful, poorly optimized software can deplete a device's battery much faster than necessary. Heavy resource usage has been shown to be a reason leading to poor app reviews in online app stores.","authors":["Gustavo Pinto","Fernando Castor"],"meta":["November 2017Communications of the ACM 60(12):68-75","DOI:10.1145/3154384","Project: Energy Aware Software"],"references":["323541532_Using_Automatic_Refactoring_to_Improve_Energy_Efficiency_of_Android_Apps","318332586_Leafactor_Improving_Energy_Efficiency_of_Android_Apps_via_Automatic_Refactoring","312485704_A_Comprehensive_Study_on_the_Energy_Efficiency_of_Java's_Thread-Safe_Collections","308788050_On_the_impact_of_sampling_frequency_on_software_energy_measurements","308784442_On_the_impact_of_sampling_frequency_on_software_energy_measurements","305560675_Refactoring_for_Energy_Efficiency_A_Reflection_on_the_State_of_the_Art","318127736_A_Study_on_the_Energy_Consumption_of_Android_App_Development_Approaches","317369746_Assisting_Non-Specialist_Developers_to_Build_Energy-Efficient_Software","308849655_Going_Green_An_Exploratory_Analysis_of_Energy-Related_Questions","308730068_GreenAdvisor_A_tool_for_analyzing_the_impact_of_software_evolution_on_energy_consumption"]}
