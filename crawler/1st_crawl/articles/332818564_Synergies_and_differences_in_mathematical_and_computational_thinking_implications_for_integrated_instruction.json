{"id":"332818564_Synergies_and_differences_in_mathematical_and_computational_thinking_implications_for_integrated_instruction","abstract":"A key debate in computer science education is whether and how computational thinking (CT) is used within disciplines other than computer science. Broad definitions provide many avenues for developing integrated instruction, as practices within existing activities can simply be reframed in terms of CT. But such general use of the term CT may confuse its meaning and dilute its power as a tool for bringing CS to all. In this paper, we take the viewpoint that mathematical thinking and computational thinking share common practices, such as using repetition to accomplish tasks, but these shared ideas may develop differently in mathematics and computer science. We use document analysis to analyze the K-5 Common Core State Standards for Mathematics for the presence of these common practices and describe the specific ways they develop in mathematics. We compare these elements of mathematical thinking to related elements of CT to identify synergies and differences between CT and mathematical thinking. We argue that these synergies and differences have implications for the development of integrated instruction designed to bring CS to all.","authors":["Kathryn M.
