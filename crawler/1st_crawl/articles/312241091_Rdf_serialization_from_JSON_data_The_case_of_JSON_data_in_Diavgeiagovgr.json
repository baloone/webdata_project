The most important open data providers publish their data in JSON format. In this paper, we present the main features of JSON data compared with those of JSON LD data and their capabilities. We also present, RDF triples production methodologies from JSON and JSON-LD data as infrastructure to support the linked open data. For this reason, we propose a related algorithm and its implementation in programming environment, and we are testing this on open data retrieved by the Greek open data repository. Finally we present the case of RDF triples production with the help of relevant tools.","authors":["Stamatis Theocharis","George A.
