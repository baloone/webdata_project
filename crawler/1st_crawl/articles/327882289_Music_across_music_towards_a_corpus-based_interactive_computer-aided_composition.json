{"id":"327882289_Music_across_music_towards_a_corpus-based_interactive_computer-aided_composition","abstract":"The reworking of existing music in order to build new one is a quintessential characteristic of the Western musical tradition. This thesis proposes and discusses my personal approach to the subject: the borrowing of music fragments from large-scale corpora (containing audio samples as well as symbolic scores) in order to build a low-level, descriptor-based palette of grains. Parameters are handled via digital hybrid scores, in order to equip corpus-based composition with the control of notational practices. This thesis also introduces the dada library, providing Max with the ability to organize, select and generate musical content via a set of graphical interfaces manifesting an exploratory approach towards music composition. Its modules address a range of scenarios, including, but not limited to, database visualization, score segmentation and analysis, concatenative synthesis, music generation via physical or geometrical modelling, wave terrain synthesis, graph exploration, cellular automata, swarm intelligence, and videogames. The library is open-source and it fosters a performative approach to computer-aided composition. Finally, this thesis addresses the issue of whether classical representation of music, disentangled in the standard set of traditional parameters, is optimal. Two possible alternatives to orthogonal decompositions are presented: grain-based score representations, inheriting techniques from corpus-based composition, and unsupervised machine learning models, providing entangled, `agnostic' representations of music. The thesis also details my first experience of collaborative writing within the /nu/thing collective.","authors":["Daniele Ghisi"],"meta":["December 2017"],"references":["328777063_librosa_Audio_and_Music_Signal_Analysis_in_Python","318868573_Audio_Super_Resolution_using_Neural_Networks","315511335_Generating_Polyphonic_Music_Using_Tied_Parallel_Networks","311900821_SampleRNN_An_Unconditional_End-to-End_Neural_Audio_Generation_Model","309463721_CONCATENATIVE_SYNTHESIS_VIA_CHORD-BASED_SEGMENTATION_FOR_AN_EXPERIMENT_WITH_TIME","308670645_Towards_Intelligent_Orchestration_Systems","308026508_WaveNet_A_Generative_Model_for_Raw_Audio","284837658_About_TreeTorika_Rhetoric_CAAC_and_Mao","265073018_Towards_the_implementation_of_a_generic_platform_for_networked_music_performance_The_diamouses_approach","257882504_Distributed_Representations_of_Words_and_Phrases_and_their_Compositionality","256104772_ESSENTIA_an_Audio_Analysis_Library_for_Music_Information_Retrieval","254892868_The_Quantization_of_Musical_Time_A_Connectionist_Approach","347100927_Postmodern_Music_Postmodern_Listening","345773149_PLATONISM_IN_MUSIC_A_KIND_OF_DEFENSE","319770355_Generative_Adversarial_Nets","319770144_Unsupervised_Representation_Learning_with_Deep_Convolutional_Generative_Adversarial_Networks","318494464_Pure_data_another_integrated_computer_music_environment","315878049_Theft_A_History_of_Music","315838421_The_Snail_un_nouveau_procede_d'analyse_et_de_visualisation_du_son","310666097_Extending_bach_A_Family_of_Libraries_for_Real-time_Computer-assisted_Composition_in_Max","308841812_madmom_A_New_Python_Audio_and_Music_Signal_Processing_Library","308298055_VoxNet_A_3D_Convolutional_Neural_Network_for_real-time_object_recognition","297351950_Music_Derived_from_Other_Sources","287367288_Combining_the_Acoustic_and_the_Digital_Music_for_Instruments_and_Computers_or_Prerecorded_Sound","285895924_Linguistic_regularities_in_continuous_space_word_representations","284605595_All_Made_of_Tunes_Charles_Ives_and_the_Uses_of_Musical_Borrowing","281768871_Representation_of_Musical_Structures_and_Processes_in_Simplicial_Chord_Spaces","280300071_The_Uses_of_Existing_Music_Musical_Borrowing_as_a_Field","279827208_Towards_a_mathematical_model_of_tonality","277972986_A_Max_Library_for_Musical_Notation_and_Computer-Aided_Composition","275849457_Articulating_Microtime","272746440_Godel_Escher_Bach","271545094_Reactive_Visual_Programs_for_Computer-Aided_Music_Composition","270819386_Corpus-Based_Concatenative_Synthesis","267378674_Recurrent_Neural_Networks_for_Noise_Reduction_in_Robust_ASR","266339930_Geometry_by_Discovery","263964335_Philosophy_of_Composition_Is_There_Such_a_Thing","263964240_Composing_Music_with_Computers","263964123_Experiments_in_musical_intelligence","263716677_Real-Time_Computer-Aided_Composition_with_bach","263297961_PROFILE-_libreria_per_il_controllo_del_profilo_melodico_per_Patchwork","260792023_PWGL_A_Novel_Visual_Language_based_on_Common_Lisp_CLOS_and_OpenGL","259532895_The_Art_of_Game_Design_A_book_of_lenses","257291675_Microsound","255708621_Computer_Assisted_Composition_Today","255708615_OMClouds_petits_nuages_de_contraintes_dans_OpenMusic","255708460_Computer_Assisted_Composition_at_Ircam_patchWork_OpenMusic","253846666_A_sense_of_the_mysterious_science_and_the_human_spirit","249239939_PRESCRIPTIVE_AND_DESCRIPTIVE_MUSIC-WRITING","248931123_Tempus_ex_Machina_A_composer's_reflections_on_musical_time","247623544_Spiral_Detection_of_Periodicity_and_the_Spiral_Form_of_Musical_Scales","243768297_Common_Music_A_Music_Composition_Language_in_Common_Lisp_and_CLOS","243703685_Kant_a_Critique_of_Pure_Quantification","243635384_A_Connectionist_Approach_to_Algorithmic_Composition","243503803_GNU_MP_The_GNU_Multiple_Precision_Arithmetic_Library"]}
