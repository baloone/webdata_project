{"id":"290752480_Modeling_and_Security_Analysis_of_a_Commercial_Real-Time_Operating_System_Kernel","abstract":"This chapter summarizes the modeling and formal analysis effort that led to an EAL6+ certification for a commercial real-time operating system kernel. We begin by describing the INTEGRITY-178B kernel, as well as the approach taken for the Common Criteria evaluation effort. We present a generalization of the GWV theorem, formulated in order to capture the meaning of separation in a dynamic system. We detail how the INTEGRITY-178B kernel was modeled, including System State, Behavior, and Information Flow. We discuss the proof architecture used to demonstrate correspondence and conclude with a description of the informal analysis of the hardware abstraction layer.","authors":["Raymond J.
