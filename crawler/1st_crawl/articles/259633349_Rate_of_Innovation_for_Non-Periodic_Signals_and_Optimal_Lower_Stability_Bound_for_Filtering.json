{"id":"259633349_Rate_of_Innovation_for_Non-Periodic_Signals_and_Optimal_Lower_Stability_Bound_for_Filtering","abstract":"One of fundamental problems in sampling theory is to reconstruct (non-)periodic signals from their filtered signals in a stable way. In this paper, we obtain a universal upper bound to the rate of innovation for signals in a closed linear space, which can be stably reconstructed, via the optimal lower stability bound for filtering on that linear space.","authors":["Qiyu Sun","Jun Xian"],"meta":["February 2014Journal of Fourier Analysis and Applications 20(1)","DOI:10.1007/s00041-013-9308-z"],"references":["247946531_The_Poincare_inequality_is_an_open_ended_property","244466729_p-Frames_and_Shift_Invariant_Subspaces_of_L_p","242105711_Locally_finite_dimensional_shift-invariant_spaces_in_Rd","238282902_Non-uniform_sampling_and_reconstruction_in_shift-invariant_spaces","346673037_Locally_finite_dimensional_shift-invariant_spaces_in_mathbf_Rd","299022089_The_Poincare_inequality_is_an_open_ended_condition","266539792_Harmonic_analysis_on_spaces_of_homogeneous_type_With_a_preface_by_Yves_Meyer","242144031_Nonuniform_Sampling_and_Reconstruction_in_Shift-Invariant_Spaces","238866051_Local_Sampling_and_Reconstruction_in_Shift-Invariant_Spaces_and_Their_Applications_in_Spline_Subspaces","238854333_Average_sampling_in_L_2"]}
