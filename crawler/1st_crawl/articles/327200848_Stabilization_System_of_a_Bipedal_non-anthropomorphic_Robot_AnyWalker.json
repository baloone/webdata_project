{"id":"327200848_Stabilization_System_of_a_Bipedal_non-anthropomorphic_Robot_AnyWalker","abstract":"We present a bipedal walking non-anthropomorphic robot AnyWalker developed in the laboratory of robotics and mechatronics of the Kuban State University. The goal is to be able to overcome obstacles exceeding the size of the robot itself. In addition to the degrees of freedom due to the joints between the links, the robot is equipped with reaction wheels enhancing its dynamic stabilization capabilities. This paper presents a study of the stability zones in the frontal plane of the robot with and without the reaction wheel support.","authors":["Igor Ryadchikov","Semyon Sechenev","Michail Drobotenko","Alexander Svidlov"],"meta":["November 2018Journal of Engineering Science and Technology Review 11(5):128-133","DOI:10.25103/jestr.115.15","Project: AnyWalker"],"references":["321949308_Development_of_robotic_mobile_platform_with_the_universal_chassis_system","313902038_Design_process_and_tools_for_dynamic_neuromechanical_models_and_robot_controllers","286679854_Experimental_verification_of_an_approach_for_disturbance_estimation_and_compensation_on_a_simulated_biped_during_perturbed_stance","284001441_Optimization_of_energy_efficiency_of_walking_bipedal_robots_by_use_of_elastic_couplings_in_the_form_of_mechanical_springs","282339130_Adaptive_and_Energy_Efficient_Walking_in_a_Hexapod_Robot_Under_Neuromechanical_Control_and_Sensorimotor_Learning","281780675_Humans_Can_Continuously_Optimize_Energetic_Cost_during_Walking","271547619_Design_of_a_kangaroo_robot_with_dynamic_jogging_locomotion","270741140_Design_Principles_for_Energy-Efficient_Legged_Locomotion_and_Implementation_on_the_MIT_Cheetah_Robot","265356280_CONTROL_OF_APERIODIC_WALKING_AND_THE_ENERGETIC_EFFECTS_OF_PARALLEL_JOINT_COMPLIANCE_OF_PLANAR_BIPEDAL_ROBOTS_Dissertation_Committee","261484134_The_Cubli_A_reaction_wheel_based_3D_inverted_pendulum"]}
