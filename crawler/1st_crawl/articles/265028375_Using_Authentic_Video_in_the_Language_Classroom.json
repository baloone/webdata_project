{"id":"265028375_Using_Authentic_Video_in_the_Language_Classroom","abstract":"Cambridge University Press 2003, 277pp., £16.20 isbn 0–521–79961–9 Using Authentic Video in the Language Classroom is yet another feather that sits gracefully on Cambridge University Press's already crowded cap of quality publishing. It is an excellent sourcebook for those looking for one that says everything which all 'those' put together can ever think of. And if lucidity is its heart, simplicity is its soul. Even the beginning is quite inviting, and may even create an appetite in a teacher with objections to using authentic video. The ten-page introduction misses nothing. It is an amazingly comprehensive treatment of using authentic video, and it serves as a cohesive and coherent backdrop to the rest of the book. What strikes you, among other things like its exhaustiveness, is Ms Sherman's persuasive discourse. A sentence will do to give you an idea of her thoughtful, sensible handling: '. . . most classroom activities are inspired by the material and not vice versa' (p. 7). You can't but be impressed by the author's in-depth knowledge and understanding of various video items, and her ingenuity in associating these items with varied but appropriate areas of language learning.","authors":["Jane Sherman"],"meta":["January 2003"],"references":[]}
