{"id":"275377266_Modeling_and_Experiments_of_Buckling_Modes_and_Deflection_of_Fixed-Guided_Beams_in_Compliant_Mechanisms","abstract":"This paper explores the deflection and buckling of fixed-guided beams used in compliant mechanisms. The paper's main contributions include the addition of an axial deflection model to existing beam bending models, the exploration of the deflection domain of a fixed-guided beam, and the demonstration that nonlinear finite element models typically incorrectly predict a beam's buckling mode unless unrealistic constraints are placed on the beam. It uses an analytical model for predicting the reaction forces, moments, and buckling modes of a fixed-guided beam undergoing large deflections. The model for the bending behavior of the beam is found using elliptic integrals. A model for the axial deflection of the buckling beam is also developed. These two models are combined to predict the performance of a beam undergoing large deflections including higher order buckling modes. The force versus displacement predictions of the model are compared to the experimental force versus deflection data of a bistable mechanism and a thermomechanical in-plane microactuator (TIM). The combined models show good agreement with the force versus deflection data for each device.","authors":["Gregory L Holst","Gregory Teichert","Brian D.
