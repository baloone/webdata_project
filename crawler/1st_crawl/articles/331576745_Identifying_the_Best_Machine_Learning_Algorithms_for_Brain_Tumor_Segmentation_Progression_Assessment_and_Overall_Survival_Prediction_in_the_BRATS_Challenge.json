Two segmentation categories are adopted instead of three segmentations , which is beyond the ordinary scope of BraTS 2018's segmentation challenge. The test results(the worst blind test, 51%: the nominal test, 71%) of 'survival prediction' challenge have proved the early feasibility of our neuromorphic neural network for helping the medical doctors, considering the human clinical accuracy of 50%~70%.","authors":["Spyridon Bakas","Mauricio Reyes","Andr√°s Jakab","Stefan Bauer"],"meta":["March 2019","Projects: Brain Image AnalysisAutomatic brain tumor segmentation and analysisTissue segmentation and quantification on brain MRI using convolutional neural networks"],"references":["327629521_ISLES_2016_and_2017-Benchmarking_Ischemic_Stroke_Lesion_Outcome_Prediction_Based_on_Multispectral_MRI","326301423_Epidermal_Growth_Factor_Receptor_Extracellular_Domain_Mutations_in_Glioblastoma_Present_Opportunities_for_Clinical_Imaging_and_Therapeutic_Development","321234001_Residual_Convolutional_Neural_Network_for_Determination_of_IDH_Status_in_Low-_and_High-grade_Gliomas_from_MR_Imaging","319493877_Advancing_The_Cancer_Genome_Atlas_glioma_MRI_collections_with_expert_segmentation_labels_and_radiomic_features","318642202_Segmentation_Labels_and_Radiomic_Features_for_the_Pre-operative_Scans_of_the_TCGA-GBM_collection","316312968_In_Vivo_Detection_of_EGFRvIII_in_Glioblastoma_via_Perfusion_Magnetic_Resonance_Imaging_Signature_Consistent_with_Deep_Peritumoral_Infiltration_The_ph-Index","312592438_Modified_Criteria_for_Radiographic_Response_Assessment_in_Glioblastoma_Clinical_Trials","311805734_Image_biomarker_standardisation_initiative_-_feature_definitions","324225490_In_vivo_evaluation_of_EGFRvIII_mutation_in_primary_glioblastoma_patients_via_complex_multiparametric_MRI_signature","318642200_Segmentation_Labels_and_Radiomic_Features_for_the_Pre-operative_Scans_of_the_TCGA-LGG_collection"]}
