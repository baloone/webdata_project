{"id":"298226676_Verification_of_Workflow_nets","abstract":"Workflow management systems will change the architecture of future information systems dramatically. The explicit representation of business procedures is one of the main issues when introducing a workflow management system. In this paper we focus on a class of Petri nets suitable for the representation, validation and verification of these procedures. We will show that the correctness of a procedure represented by such a Petri net can be verified by using standard Petri-net-based techniques. Based on this result we provide a comprehensive set of transformation rules which can be used to construct and modify correct procedures.","authors":["Wil Van der Aalst"],"meta":["January 1997Lecture Notes in Computer Science","Conference: 18th International Conference on Application and Theory of Petri NetsVolume: 1248"],"references":["228706036_A_class_of_Petri_nets_for_modeling_and_analyzing_business_processes","222503536_Business_Process_Redesign_A_Petri-net-based_approach","222488605_Putting_Petri_nets_to_work_in_industry","313104361_Modelling_and_enactment_of_workflow_systems","251442346_Synthesis_rules_for_Petri_nets_and_how_they_can_lead_to_new_results","248470252_Workflow_Management_for_Process_Organisations","229125005_On_complete_reducability_of_some_classes_of_Petri_nets","229124468_The_Workflow_Imperative","229124316_Proper_Termination_of_Flow-of-control_in_Programs_Involving_Concurrent_Processes","222760123_Complexity_Results_for_1-safe_Nets"]}
