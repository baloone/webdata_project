{"id":"221038623_Towards_the_Secure_Modelling_of_OLAP_Users'_Behaviour","abstract":"Information Security is a crucial aspect for organizations, and must be considered during the development of Information Systems. The data in Data Warehouses (DWs) are highly sensitive since they manage historical information which is used to make strategic decisions, and security constraints should therefore be included in DW modelling within its structural aspects. However, another dynamic security component is also related to the sequences of OLAP (On-Line Analytical Processing) operations, and could be used to access (or infer) unauthorized information. This paper complements the modelling of DWs with state models, which permit the modelling of these dynamic situations in which sensitive information could be inferred. That is, it models queries that include security issues, and controls that their evolution through the application of OLAP operations always leads to authorized states. Finally, our proposal has been applied to a healthcare case study in which a DW manages admissions information with various security constraints.","authors":["Carlos Blanco","Eduardo Fernández-Medina","Juan Trujillo","Jan Jürjens"],"meta":["September 2010","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-15546-8_8","SourceDBLP","Conference: Secure Data Management, 7th VLDB Workshop, SDM 2010, Singapore, September 17, 2010.
