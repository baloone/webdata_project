{"id":"323069514_Mining_constrained_inter-sequence_patterns_a_novel_approach_to_cope_with_item_constraints","abstract":"Data mining has become increasingly important in the Internet era. The problem of mining inter-sequence pattern is a sub-task in data mining with several algorithms in the recent years. However, these algorithms only focus on the transitional problem of mining frequent inter-sequence patterns and most frequent inter-sequence patterns are either redundant or insignificant. As such, it can confuse end users during decision-making and can require too much system resources. This led to the problem of mining inter-sequence patterns with item constraints, which addressed the problem when end-users only concerned the patterns contained a number of specific items. In this paper, we propose two novel algorithms for it. First is the ISP-IC (Inter-Sequence Pattern with Item Constraint mining) algorithm based on a theorem that quickly determines whether an inter-sequence pattern satisfies the constraints. Then, we propose a way to improve the strategy of ISP-IC, which is then applied to the \\(i\\)ISP-IC algorithm to enhance the performance of the process. Finally, pi ISP-IC, a parallel version of \\(i\\)ISP-IC, will be presented. Experimental results show that pi ISP-IC algorithm outperforms the post-processing of the-state-of-the-art method for mining inter-sequence patterns (EISP-Miner), ISP-IC, and \\(i\\)ISP-IC algorithms in most of the cases.","authors":["Tuong Le","Anh Nguyen","Bao Huynh","Bay Vo"],"meta":["May 2018Applied Intelligence 48(3)","DOI:10.1007/s10489-017-1123-9","Project: Scaling up Data Mining methods using parallel and distributed computing techniques"],"references":["318990970_Mining_of_high_utility-probability_sequential_patterns_from_uncertain_databases","313476858_A_Survey_of_Sequential_Pattern_Mining","309517669_Efficiently_Updating_the_Discovered_Sequential_Patterns_for_Sequence_Modification","301666451_An_efficient_algorithm_to_maintain_the_discovered_frequent_sequences_with_record_deletion","316863459_Mining_top-_k_co-occurrence_items_with_sequential_pattern","316608337_A_novel_approach_for_mining_maximal_frequent_patterns","312324091_A_novel_approach_for_mining_maximal_frequent_patterns","311358101_Enhanced_sequence_identification_technique_for_protein_sequence_database_mining_with_hybrid_frequent_pattern_mining_algorithm","309759156_Mining_of_high_average-utility_itemsets_using_novel_list_structure_and_pruning_strategy","299476405_High_Utility_Pattern_Mining_over_Data_Streams_with_Sliding_Window_Technique","292949167_Efficient_mining_of_high_utility_patterns_with_considering_of_Rarity_and_Length","288933172_Top-K_Miner_top-K_identical_frequent_itemsets_discovery_without_user_support_threshold","279634279_CCSpan_Mining_Closed_Contiguous_Sequential_Patterns","297677966_Fast_algorithm_for_high_utility_pattern_mining_with_the_sum_of_item_quantities","279158057_A_new_approach_for_the_deep_order_preserving_submatrix_problem_based_on_sequential_pattern_mining"]}
