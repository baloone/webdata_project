PET and CT imaging are routinely used for LNM identification. However, uncertainties of LNM always exist especially for small size or reactive nodes. Radiomics and deep learning are the two preferred imaging-based strategies for node malignancy prediction. Radiomics models are built based on handcrafted features, and deep learning can learn the features automatically. We proposed a hybrid predictive model that combines many-objective radiomics (MO-radiomics) and 3-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) through evidential reasoning (ER) approach. To build a more reliable model, we proposed a new many-objective radiomics model. Meanwhile, we designed a 3D-CNN that fully utilizes spatial contextual information. Finally, the outputs were fused through the ER approach. To study the predictability of the two modalities, three models were built for PET, CT, and PET& CT. The results showed that the model performed best when the two modalities were combined. Moreover, we showed that the quantitative results obtained from the hybrid model were better than those obtained from MO-radiomics and 3D-CNN.","authors":["Zhiguo Zhou","Liyuan Chen","David Sher","Qiongwen Zhang"],"meta":["July 2018Conference proceedings: ...
