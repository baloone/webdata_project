{"id":"317396044_A_gamification_experience_to_improve_engineering_students'_performance_through_motivation","abstract":"The students' lack of motivation is a usual problem. The students value more the obtention of the degree than the developing of competences and skills. In order to fight this, we developed a gamification's experience based on merits and leaderboards. The merits are linked to the attainment of skills and competences that students usually do not appreciate. During the year 2016, we are carrying out a pilot involving 950 students at the Graduate of Engineering in Computer Science at theAutonomous University of Barcelona (UAB).","authors":["Adrián Sánchez-Carmona","S.
