{"id":"220617423_Genetic_Design_of_Drugs_Without_Side-Effects","abstract":"Consider two sets of strings, B (bad genes) and G (good genes), as well as two integers db and dg (db ≤ dg). A frequently occurring problem in computational biology (and other fields) is to find a (distinguishing) substring s of length L that distinguishes the bad strings from good strings, i.e., such that for each string si ∈B there exists a length-L substring ti of si with d(s, ti) ≤ db (close to bad strings), and for every substring ui of length L of every string gi ∈G , d(s, ui) ≥ dg (far from good strings). We present a polynomial time approximation scheme to settle the problem; i.e., for any constant �> 0, the algorithm finds a string s of length L such that for every si ∈B there is a length-L substring ti of si with d(ti ,s ) ≤ (1+ � )db, and for every substring ui of length L of every gi ∈G , d(ui ,s ) ≥ (1 − � )dg if a solution to the original pair (db ≤ dg) exists. Since there is a polynomial number of such pairs (db ,d g), we can exhaust all the possibilities in polynomial time to find a good approximation required by the corresponding application problems.","authors":["Xiaotie Deng","Guojun Li","Zimao Li","Bin ma"],"meta":["June 2003SIAM Journal on Computing 32(4):1073-1090","DOI:10.1137/S0097539701397825","SourceDBLP"],"references":["220779226_Efficient_Approximation_Algorithms_for_the_Hamming_Center_Problem","220261894_Primer_Master_A_new_program_for_the_design_and_analysis_of_PCR_primers","21434782_An_improved_microcomputer_program_for_finding_gene-_or_gene_family-specific_oligonucleotides_suitable_as_primers_for_polymerase_chain_reactions_or_as_probes","228057840_Randomized_Algorithms","222657536_Distinguishing_String_Selection_Problems","221314104_Polynomial-Time_Algorithms_for_Computing_Characteristic_Strings","221314007_A_Polynomial_Time_Approximation_Scheme_for_the_Closest_Substring_Problem","221313766_Banishing_Bias_from_Consensus_Sequences","220263840_An_improved_microcomputer_program_for_finding_gene-_or_gene_family-specific_oligonucleotides_suitable_as_primers_for_polymerase_chain_reactions_or_as_probes","220262685_Design_of_primers_for_PCR_ampiification_of_highly_variable_genomes"]}
