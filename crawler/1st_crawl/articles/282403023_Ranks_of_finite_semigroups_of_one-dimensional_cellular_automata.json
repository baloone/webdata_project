{"id":"282403023_Ranks_of_finite_semigroups_of_one-dimensional_cellular_automata","abstract":"Since first introduced by John von Neumann, the notion of cellular automaton\nhas grown into a key concept in computer science, physics and theoretical\nbiology. In its classical setting, a cellular automaton is a transformation of\nthe set of all configurations of a regular grid such that the image of any\nparticular cell of the grid is determined by a fixed local function that only\ndepends on a fixed finite neighbourhood. In recent years, with the introduction\nof a generalised definition in terms of transformations of the form $\\tau : A^G\n\\to A^G$ (where $G$ is any group and $A$ is any set), the theory of cellular\nautomata has been greatly enriched by its connections with group theory and\ntopology. In this paper, we begin the finite semigroup theoretic study of\ncellular automata by investigating the rank (i.e. the cardinality of a smallest\ngenerating set) of the semigroup $\\text{CA}(\\mathbb{Z}_n; A)$ consisting of all\ncellular automata over the cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}_n$ and a finite set $A$. In\nparticular, we determine this rank when $n$ is equal to $p$, $2^k$ or $2^kp$,\nfor any odd prime $p$ and $k \\geq 1$, and we give upper and lower bounds for\nthe general case.","authors":["Alonso Castillo-Ramirez","Maximilien Gadouleau"],"meta":["October 2016Semigroup Forum 93(2)","DOI:10.1007/s00233-016-9783-z","SourcearXiv"],"references":["261439955_The_rank_of_the_semigroup_of_transformations_stabilising_a_partition_of_a_finite_set","253646083_The_minimal_number_of_generators_of_a_finite_semigroup","300786142_Groups_and_Monoids_of_Cellular_Automata","275620232_Theory_of_Self-Reproducing_Automata","268935773_Groups_generated_by_two_operators_s_1_s_2_satisfying_the_equation_s_1_s_2_2_s_2_s_1_2","266599264_Permutation_Groups","265889531_Classical_finite_transformation_semigroups_An_introduction","264996626_Amenable_groups_and_cellular_automata","256105482_Witt_vectors_and_the_algebra_of_necklaces","247040517_On_groups_generated_by_two_operations"]}
