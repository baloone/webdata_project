{"id":"261113563_Evaluation_of_SIRIUS_retinal_vessel_width_measurement_in_REVIEW_dataset","abstract":"This paper focuses on evaluating a method for measuring the retinal vessel widths in a recently publicly available database (REVIEW). The algorithm is based on deformable models and it constitutes an essential step in a methodology to compute the AVR automatically. This methodology is part of a web-based framework aimed to integrate diverse techniques in the field of retinal image analysis. The results achieved in the REVIEW database indicate the method is comparable or, in some cases, improves the accuracy of other techniques for measuring the vessel widths.","authors":["Sonia González Vázquez","Noelia Barreira","M.G.
