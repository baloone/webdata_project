{"id":"259128345_The_minimum_sum_representation_as_an_index_of_voting_power","abstract":"We propose a new power index based on the minimum sum representation (MSR) of a weighted voting game. The MSR offers a redesign of a voting game, such that voting power as measured by the MSR index becomes proportional to voting weight. The MSR index is a coherent measure of power that is ordinally equivalent to the Banzhaf, Shapley–Shubik and Johnston indices. We provide a characterization for a bicameral meet as a weighted game or a complete game, and show that the MSR index is immune to the bicameral meet paradox. We discuss the computation of the MSR index using a linear integer program and the inverse MSR problem of designing a weighted voting game with a given distribution of power.","authors":["Josep Freixas","Serguei Kaniovski"],"meta":["March 2014European Journal of Operational Research 233(3):739–748","DOI:10.1016/j.ejor.2013.09.010","Project: Decision theory and voting"],"references":["314454170_On_Minimum_Sum_Representations_for_Weighted_Voting_Games","316631308_Institutional_Design_and_Power_Relations_in_the_African_Development_Bank","313124372_A_method_for_evaluating_the_distribution_of_power_in_a_committee_system","303920031_Weighted_voting_does_not_work_a_mathematical_analysis","266162707_Mathematics_and_Politics_Strategy_Voting_Power_and_Proof","265547007_Common_internal_properties_among_power_indices","250890117_Weighted_games_without_a_unique_minimal_representation_in_integers","234617931_Topics_in_the_Theory_of_Voting","233599765_Institutional_Design_and_Power_Relations_in_the_African_Development_Bank","233173187_State_power_in_a_multilateral_context_Voting_strength_in_the_Asian_Development_Bank"]}
