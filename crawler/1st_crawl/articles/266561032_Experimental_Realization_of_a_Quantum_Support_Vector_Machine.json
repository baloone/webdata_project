{"id":"266561032_Experimental_Realization_of_a_Quantum_Support_Vector_Machine","abstract":"Machines are possible to have some artificial intelligence like human beings\nowing to particular algorithms or software. Such machines could learn knowledge\nfrom what people taught them and do works according to the knowledge. In\npractical learning cases, the data is often extremely complicated and large,\nthus classical learning machines often need huge computational resources.\nQuantum machine learning algorithm, on the other hand, could be exponentially\nfaster than classical machines using quantum parallelism. Here, we demonstrate\na quantum machine learning algorithm on a four-qubit NMR test bench to solve an\noptical character recognition problem, also known as the handwriting\nrecognition. The quantum machine learns standard character fonts and then\nrecognize handwritten characters from a set with two candidates. To our best\nknowledge, this is the first artificial intelligence realized on a quantum\nprocessor. Due to the widespreading importance of artificial intelligence and\nits tremendous consuming of computational resources, quantum speedup would be\nextremely attractive against the challenges from the Big Data.","authors":["Zhaokai Li","Liu Xiaomei","Xu Nanyang","Du jiangfeng"],"meta":["October 2014Physical Review Letters 114(14)","DOI:10.1103/PhysRevLett.114.140504","SourcearXiv"],"references":["264903830_A_two-qubit_photonic_quantum_processor_and_its_application_to_solving_systems_of_linear_equations","264862759_Experimental_Implementation_of_Adiabatic_Passage_between_Different_Topological_Orders","258085144_Quantum_Algorithm_for_Data_Fitting","235638955_Experimental_Quantum_Computing_to_Solve_Systems_of_Linear_Equations","235427257_Rites_of_passage_Experiences_of_transition_for_forced_Hazara_migrants_and_refugees_in_Australia","220578095_Least_Squares_Support_Vector_Machine_Classifiers","51529036_Simulation_of_Chemical_Isomerization_Reaction_Dynamics_on_a_NMR_Quantum_Simulator","2202627_Experimental_realization_of_a_quantum_algorithm","273002355_Convex_Optimization","271513141_Support_Vector_Networks","263297316_Experimental_Realization_of_a_Compressed_Quantum_Simulation_of_a_32-Spin_Ising_Chain","262562753_Introduction_to_Machine_Learning","255904253_Quantum_Mechanics_Helps_in_Searching_for_a_Needle_in_a_Haystack","243964127_Quantum_algorithms_for_supervised_and_unsupervised_machine_learning","243964117_Quantum_principal_component_analysis","243964048_Quantum_Support_Vector_Machine_for_Big_Data_Classification","232803629_Implementation_of_a_quantum_search_algorithm_on_a_quantum_computer","222303845_Feature_extraction_methods_for_character_recognition-A_survey","220343922_Support_Vector_Network","216778488_The_quantum_state_tomography_on_an_NMR_system","43021697_NMR_Implementation_of_a_Molecular_Hydrogen_Quantum_Simulation_with_Adiabatic_State_Preparation","41761089_Quantum_computers","38082160_Quantum_Algorithm_for_Linear_Systems_of_Equations","8081160_Optimal_control_of_coupled_spin_dynamics_Design_of_NMR_pulse_sequences_by_gradient_ascent_algorithms","2661734_Algorithms_for_Quantum_Computation_Discrete_Logarithms_and_Factoring","2564920_Bulk_Spin-Resonance_Quantum_Computation","2185300_Preparation_of_pseudo-pure_states_by_line-selective_pulses_in_Nuclear_Magnetic_Resonance"]}
