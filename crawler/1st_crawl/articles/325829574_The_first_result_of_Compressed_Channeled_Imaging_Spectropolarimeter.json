{"id":"325829574_The_first_result_of_Compressed_Channeled_Imaging_Spectropolarimeter","abstract":"We presented a compressed channeled imaging spectropolarimeter, which was designed based on the channeled spectropolarimeter and coded aperture snapshot spectral imager. The 2-D spatial, 1-D spectral and 4-D full Stokes polarization information can be obtained simultaneously.","authors":["Wenyi Ren","Chen Fu","Gonzalo R.
