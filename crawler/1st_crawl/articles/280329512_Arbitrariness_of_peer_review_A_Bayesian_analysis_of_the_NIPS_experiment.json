{"id":"280329512_Arbitrariness_of_peer_review_A_Bayesian_analysis_of_the_NIPS_experiment","abstract":"The principle of peer review is central to the evaluation of research, by\nensuring that only high-quality items are funded or published. But peer review\nhas also received criticism, as the selection of reviewers may introduce biases\nin the system. In 2014, the organizers of the ``Neural Information Processing\nSystems\\rq\\rq{} conference conducted an experiment in which $10\\%$ of submitted\nmanuscripts (166 items) went through the review process twice. Arbitrariness\nwas measured as the conditional probability for an accepted submission to get\nrejected if examined by the second committee. This number was equal to $60\\%$,\nfor a total acceptance rate equal to $22.5\\%$. Here we present a Bayesian\nanalysis of those two numbers, by introducing a hidden parameter which measures\nthe probability that a submission meets basic quality criteria. The standard\nquality criteria usually include novelty, clarity, reproducibility, correctness\nand no form of misconduct, and are met by a large proportions of submitted\nitems. The Bayesian estimate for the hidden parameter was equal to $56\\%$\n($95\\%$CI: $ I = (0.34, 0.83)$), and had a clear interpretation. The result\nsuggested the total acceptance rate should be increased in order to decrease\narbitrariness estimates in future review processes.","authors":["Olivier Fran√ßois"],"meta":["July 2015","SourcearXiv"],"references":["232766825_Heterogeneity_of_Inter-Rater_Reliabilities_of_Grant_Peer_Reviews_and_Its_Determinants_A_General_Estimating_Equations_Approach","51824209_Peer_Review_of_Grant_Applications_A_Simple_Method_to_Identify_Proposals_with_Discordant_Reviews","5475756_Improving_the_Peer-Review_Process_for_Grant_Applications_Reliability_Validity_Bias_and_Generalizability","312685576_Open_Access_A_State_of_the_Art","277573583_The_Arbitrariness_of_Reviews_and_Advice_for_School_Administrators","276167142_Big_names_or_big_ideas_Do_peer-review_panels_select_the_best_science_proposals","271076919_Bayesian_Data_Analysis","262493528_Approximate_Bayesian_Computation_ABC_in_practice","259103086_Peer_Review_and_Manuscript_Management_in_Scientific_Journals_Guidelines_for_Good_Practice","43073328_The_Art_of_Peer-Reviewing_an_Original_Research_Paper_Important_Tips_and_Guidelines","15184385_Peer_Review_Crude_and_Understudied_but_Indispensable","10842995_Impartial_Judgment_by_the_Gatekeepers_of_Science_Fallibility_and_Accountability_in_the_Peer_Review_Process"]}
