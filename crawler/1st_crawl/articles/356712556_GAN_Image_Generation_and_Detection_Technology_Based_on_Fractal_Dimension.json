{"id":"356712556_GAN_Image_Generation_and_Detection_Technology_Based_on_Fractal_Dimension","abstract":"With the development of modern technology today, image analysis technology has become an important research direction in the computer field. Computer image processing technology is a cross and fusion involving multiple disciplines, which includes multiple research directions such as physics, chemistry, and computer science. Starting from the fractal dimension, this article studies the image generation and detection technology. The purpose of the research topic in this article is to have a deep understanding of image generation technology so as to master image processing methods proficiently. The methods used in this article include case analysis, data, comparison, and experimental methods, etc., and carry out related researches on image generation detection technology and fractal dimension. The experimental results show that the algorithm accuracy of GAN in the detection technology of computer-generated images is higher than other algorithms, and the improvement space is about 0.06.","authors":["Yuheng Guo"],"meta":["November 2021Journal of Physics Conference Series 2113(1):012063","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/2113/1/012063"],"references":["333393444_Study_on_Star-Galaxy_Image_Generation_Method_Based_on_GAN","337513073_Lidar_Data_Classification_Algorithm_Based_on_Generative_Adversarial_Network"]}
