{"id":"325418795_Bio-Signal_Complexity_Analysis_in_Epileptic_Seizure_Monitoring_A_Topic_Review","abstract":"Complexity science has provided new perspectives and opportunities for understanding a variety of complex natural or social phenomena, including brain dysfunctions like epilepsy. By delving into the complexity in electrophysiological signals and neuroimaging, new insights have emerged. These discoveries have revealed that complexity is a fundamental aspect of physiological processes. The inherent nonlinearity and non-stationarity of physiological processes limits the methods based on simpler underlying assumptions to point out the pathway to a more comprehensive understanding of their behavior and relation with certain diseases. The perspective of complexity may benefit both the research and clinical practice through providing novel data analytics tools devoted for the understanding of and the intervention about epilepsies. This review aims to provide a sketchy overview of the methods derived from different disciplines lucubrating to the complexity of bio-signals in the field of epilepsy monitoring. Although the complexity of bio-signals is still not fully understood, bundles of new insights have been already obtained. Despite the promising results about epileptic seizure detection and prediction through offline analysis, we are still lacking robust, tried-and-true real-time applications. Multidisciplinary collaborations and more high-quality data accessible to the whole community are needed for reproducible research and the development of such applications.","authors":["Zhenning Mei","Xian Zhao","Chen Hongyu","Wei Chen"],"meta":["May 2018Sensors 18(6):1720","DOI:10.3390/s18061720"],"references":["321772880_Epileptic_Seizure_Prediction_Using_Big_Data_and_Deep_Learning_Toward_a_Mobile_System","320072603_Deep_convolutional_neural_network_for_the_automated_detection_and_diagnosis_of_seizure_using_EEG_signals","318431807_EEG_Analysis_of_Seizure_Patterns_using_Visibility_Graphs_for_Detection_of_Generalized_Seizures","314507100_Operational_classification_of_seizure_types_by_the_International_League_Against_Epilepsy_Position_Paper_of_the_ILAE_Commission_for_Classification_and_Terminology","324467778_Period_Three_Implies_Chaos","319284472_A_Multi-view_Deep_Learning_Method_for_Epileptic_Seizure_Detection_using_Short-time_Fourier_Transform","319023789_Classify_Epileptic_EEG_Signals_Using_Weighted_Complex_Networks_Based_Community_Structure_Detection","317392727_A_wearable_sensor_system_for_neonatal_seizure_monitoring","316630299_Crowdsourcing_seizure_detection_Algorithm_development_and_validation_on_human_implanted_device_recordings","314507179_ILAE_classification_of_the_epilepsies_Position_paper_of_the_ILAE_Commission_for_Classification_and_Terminology","312955704_Exploring_temporal_information_in_neonatal_seizures_using_a_dynamic_time_warping_based_SVM_kernel","311658597_A_Review_of_Wearable_Sensor_Systems_for_Monitoring_Body_Movements_of_Neonates","312940435_2001_Statistical_mechanics_of_complex_networksJ","310573397_Long-term_monitoring_of_cardiorespiratory_patterns_in_drug-resistant_epilepsy","309203570_Correlation_between_volumetric_oxygenation_responses_and_electrophysiology_identifies_deep_thalamocortical_activity_during_epileptic_seizures"]}
