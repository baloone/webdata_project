{"id":"269935386_On_the_Shadow_Simplex_Method_for_Curved_Polyhedra","abstract":"We study the simplex method over polyhedra satisfying certain \"discrete\ncurvature\" lower bounds, which enforce that the boundary always meets vertices\nat sharp angles. Motivated by linear programs with totally unimodular\nconstraint matrices, recent results of Bonifas et al (SOCG 2012), Brunsch and\nR\\\"oglin (ICALP 2013), and Eisenbrand and Vempala (2014) have improved our\nunderstanding of such polyhedra.\nWe develop a new type of dual analysis of the shadow simplex method which\nprovides a clean and powerful tool for improving all previously mentioned\nresults. Our methods are inspired by the recent work of Bonifas and the first\nnamed author (SODA 2015), who analyzed a remarkably similar process as part of\nan algorithm for the Closest Vector Problem with Preprocessing.\nFor our first result, we obtain a constructive diameter bound of\n$O(\\frac{n^2}{\\delta} \\ln \\frac{n}{\\delta})$ for $n$-dimensional polyhedra with\ncurvature parameter $\\delta \\in [0,1]$. For the class of polyhedra arising from\ntotally unimodular constraint matrices, this implies a bound of $O(n^3 \\ln n)$.\nFor linear optimization, given an initial feasible vertex, we show that an\noptimal vertex can be found using an expected $O(\\frac{n^3}{\\delta} \\ln\n\\frac{n}{\\delta})$ simplex pivots, each requiring $O(m n)$ time to compute. An\ninitial feasible solution can be found using $O(\\frac{m n^3}{\\delta} \\ln\n\\frac{n}{\\delta})$ pivot steps.","authors":["Daniel Dadush","Nicolai HÃ¤hnle"],"meta":["December 2016Discrete & Computational Geometry 56(4)","DOI:10.1007/s00454-016-9793-3","SourcearXiv"],"references":["269877223_Short_Paths_on_the_Voronoi_Graph_and_the_Closest_Vector_Problem_with_Preprocessing","260212164_An_Improved_Kalai--Kleitman_Bound_for_the_Diameter_of_a_Polyhedron","230595717_Combinatorial_Optimization_Polyhedra_and_Efficiency","226978819_Random_walks_totally_unimodular_matrices_and_a_randomised_dual_simplex_algorithm","268642744_Combinatorial_optimization_Polyhedra_and_efficiency_3_volumes","261440027_Geometric_Random_Edge","242929922_The_Hirsch_Conjecture_for_Dual_Transportation_Polyhedra","242789438_An_upper_bound_for_the_diameter_of_a_polytope","236346314_Finding_Short_Paths_on_Polytopes_by_the_Shadow_Vertex_Algorithm","236124354_The_Hirsch_Conjecture_Holds_for_Normal_Flag_Complexes"]}
