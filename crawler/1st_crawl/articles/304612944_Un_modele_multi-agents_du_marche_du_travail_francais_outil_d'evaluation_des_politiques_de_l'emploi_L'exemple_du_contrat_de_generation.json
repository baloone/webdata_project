The decisions consist for firms in creating or suppressing jobs of two types, Fixed Duration Contracts, and Open Ended Contracts, as well as hiring, promoting, and laying off their employees. The individuals apply for jobs, and can quit. The interactions induce gross flows between the states of employed, unemployed, and inactive, flows which generate complete stock-flow accounts. A calibration algorithm enables us to reproduce the main caracteristics of the French labor market in 2011, which is strongly structured by the coexistence of Fixed Duration Contracts, and Open Ended Contracts. As simulated by the model, the Generation Contract is expected to lower youth unemployment, but the effect is small due to very important windfall effects as well as moderate crowding out effects. The trajectories of the youths who have benefited from the Generation Contract show a positive effect on their employment rate in the long run. Variants show that it is not easy to improve the policy scheme.\nClassification JEL : C63, J63, J64, J65, J68, K31.","authors":["Gérard Olivier Ballot","Jean-Daniel Kant","Olivier Goudet"],"meta":["January 2016Revue Économique 67(4):733","DOI:10.3917/reco.674.0733","Project: WorkSim"],"references":["228597381_An_agent-based_simulation_of_the_French_labour_market_Studying_age_discrimination","332920800_Agent-Based_Computational_Economics_Growing_Economies_from_the_Bottom_Up","313505421_Completely_derandomized_self-adaptation_in_evolution_strategies","297445413_Multi-task_Principal-Agent_Analyses_Incentive_Contracts_Asset_Ownership_and_Job_Design","275878759_Quels_effets_du_contrat_de_generation_sur_l'emploi_et_les_finances_publiques","274558508_Information_in_Labor_Marke","243765522_Les_Systemes_Multi-Agents-vers_une_intelligence_collective","234712231_Internal_Labor_Markets_and_Manpower_AnalysisM","233822567_A_Behavioral_Model_of_Rational_Choice","227441863_A_New_Type_of_Socio-Economic_System"]}
