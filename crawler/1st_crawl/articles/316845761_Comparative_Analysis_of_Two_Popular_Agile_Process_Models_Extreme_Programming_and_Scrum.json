{"id":"316845761_Comparative_Analysis_of_Two_Popular_Agile_Process_Models_Extreme_Programming_and_Scrum","abstract":"Since last two decades, agile software development methodologies have been one of the most debating topics for researchers. These are called light weight development methods because of informal, adaptive and flexible approach. These models are based on the collection of best practices which help to handle problems related to changing requirements, customer satisfaction, and product quality. A number of agile models are available to meet the needs of different projects. However Extreme Programming and Scrum are two most familiar and commonly used models. This study makes a valuable contribution by exploring these models in detail. In this paper a detailed comparison of Extreme programming and Scrum is conducted to find their similarities, differences and explores those features which complement each other","authors":["Faiza Anwer","Shabib Aftab","Syed Shah Muhammad","Usman waheed Waheed"],"meta":["March 2017","Project: Agile software development models"],"references":["292542090_Agile_Software_Development_Methods_Review_and_Analysis","289748348_Comparative_evaluation_of_XP_and_scrum_using_the_4d_analytical_tool_4-DAT","276044434_eXRUP_A_Hybrid_Software_Development_Model_for_Small_to_Medium_Scale_Projects","264093966_Agile_Methodologies_Comparative_Study_and_Future_Direction","295688755_An_Excursion_to_Software_Development_Life_Cycle_Models_An_Old_to_Ever-growing_Models","293197072_Extreme_Programming_Strengths_and_Weaknesses","290487121_Scrum_development_process","275601369_Mapping_Formal_Methods_to_Extreme_Programming_XP_-A_Futuristic_Approach","266892481_A_Study_of_the_Agile_Software_Development_Methods_Applicability_and_Implications_in_Industry","263849049_Extreme_Programming_Explained_Embrace_Change"]}
