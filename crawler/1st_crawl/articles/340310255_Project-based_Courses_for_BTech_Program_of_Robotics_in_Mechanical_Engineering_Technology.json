{"id":"340310255_Project-based_Courses_for_BTech_Program_of_Robotics_in_Mechanical_Engineering_Technology","abstract":"Abstract— Robotics program at many Colleges has continued\nto become more and more popular. However, the students of the\nBachelor of Technology (B.Tech.) program of robotics in the\nMechanical Engineering Technology (MET) are facing three\ndifficulties: (1) Weak fundamental knowledge related electrical\nengineering (EE), computer science (CS) and information\ntechnology (IT); (2) Difficulty in understanding the advanced\nconcepts and theories of robotics; (3) Limited robotics class\nhours. Therefore, devising a series of appropriate robotics classes\nfor the MET program is desirable.\nIn order to overcome the above-mentioned problems, four\nproject-based courses for the robotics program is devised and\nimplemented in the Department of MET. There are three levels\nof robotics courses ranging from ‘introduction’, ‘application’ to\n‘advanced’. A series of projects corresponding to different levels\nare designed and then are assigned to students. The students\nlearn and practice the fundamental theories of robotics through\nprojects instead of mathematical analysis. These courses have\ntwo advantages. First, the projects let the students understand\nthe theories spontaneously and expand the given projects with\nthese theories. Second, the goal of the proposed courses is to\nrelease the dependency on advanced algorithms and\noptimization. Then, the students can familiarize themselves with\nthe principal concepts of robotics, practice the application of\nhardware and software, create their own innovative projects and,\nprepare themselves for their entries into the job market, thus\nsupporting the central educational goal of cultivating\ntechnologists in MET.","authors":["Zhou Zhang","Andy Zhang","Mingshao Zhang","Sven Esche"],"meta":["March 2020Computers in Education Journal 11(1):1-10"],"references":["331973476_Design_and_Application_of_a_Platform_of_Wireless_Sensor_and_Control_Network_in_Robotics_Course_of_Mechanical_Engineering_Technology","328979587_Development_of_Telepresence_Teaching_Robots_With_Social_Capabilities","328979210_Immersive_Educational_Systems_With_Procedure-Oriented_Combinations_of_Real_and_Virtual_Environments","326244362_Conceptual_Framework_for_Integrating_a_Wireless_Sensor_and_Control_Network_into_a_Robotics_Course_for_Senior_Students_of_Mechanical_Engineering_Technology","325525469_A_virtual_proctor_with_biometric_authentication_for_facilitating_distance_education","345930605_Integration_Of_Simulation_Technology_Into_Undergraduate_Engineering_Courses_And_Laboratories","345924774_Designing_An_Undergraduate_Robotics_Engineering_Curriculum_Unified_Robotics_I_And_Ii","344839875_Robotics_as_an_Undergraduate_Major_10_Years'_Experience","344528214_Implementing_Mechatronics_Design_Methodology_in_Mechanical_Engineering_Technology_Senior_Design_Projects_at_Old_Dominion_University","325352731_The_order_of_skills_development_for_technician_and_technologist_training_curricula"]}
