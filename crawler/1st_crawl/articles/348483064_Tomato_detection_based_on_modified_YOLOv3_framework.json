{"id":"348483064_Tomato_detection_based_on_modified_YOLOv3_framework","abstract":"Fruit detection forms a vital part of the robotic harvesting platform. However, uneven environment conditions, such as branch and leaf occlusion, illumination variation, clusters of tomatoes, shading, and so on, have made fruit detection very challenging. In order to solve these problems, a modified YOLOv3 model called YOLO-Tomato models were adopted to detect tomatoes in complex environmental conditions. With the application of label what you see approach, densely architecture incorporation, spatial pyramid pooling and Mish function activation to the modified YOLOv3 model, the YOLO-Tomato models: YOLO-Tomato-A at AP 98.3% with detection time 48 ms, YOLO-Tomato-B at AP 99.3% with detection time 44 ms, and YOLO-Tomato-C at AP 99.5% with detection time 52 ms, performed better than other state-of-the-art methods.","authors":["Olarewaju Lawal"],"meta":["January 2021Scientific Reports 11(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-021-81216-5"],"references":["342129992_Goosegrass_Detection_in_Strawberry_and_Tomato_Using_a_Convolutional_Neural_Network","340994106_Optimized_YOLOv3_Algorithm_and_Its_Application_in_Traffic_Flow_Detections","340541009_YOLO-Tomato_A_Robust_Algorithm_for_Tomato_Detection_based_on_YOLOv3","332777280_A_Mature-Tomato_Detection_Algorithm_Using_Machine_Learning_and_Color_Analysis","323357827_Deep_Learning_in_Agriculture_A_Survey","319770123_Densely_Connected_Convolutional_Networks","332493627_Deep_learning_-_method_overview_and_review_of_use_for_fruit_detection_and_yield_estimation_httpsauthorselseviercoma1YvMhcFCSJKOi","327993362_Computer_vision_and_artificial_intelligence_in_precision_agriculture_for_grain_crops_A_systematic_review","323571076_Path_Aggregation_Network_for_Instance_Segmentation","320964510_Feature_Pyramid_Networks_for_Object_Detection"]}
