{"id":"323434009_Robust_Lane_Detection_and_Tracking_for_Real-Time_Applications","abstract":"An effective lane-detection algorithm is a fundamental component of an advanced driver assistant system, as it provides important information that supports driving safety. The challenges faced by the lane detection and tracking algorithm include the lack of clarity of lane markings, poor visibility due to bad weather, illumination and light reflection, shadows, and dense road-based instructions. In this paper, a robust and real-time vision-based lane detection algorithm with an efficient region of interest is proposed to reduce the high noise level and the calculation time. The proposed algorithm also processes a gradient cue and a color cue together and a line clustering with scan-line tests to verify the characteristics of the lane markings. It removes any false lane markings and tracks the real lane markings using the accumulated statistical data. The experiment results show that the proposed algorithm gives accurate results and fulfills the real-time operation requirement on embedded systems with low computing power.","authors":["Chanho Lee","Ji-Hyun Moon"],"meta":["February 2018IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems PP(99):1-6","DOI:10.1109/TITS.2018.2791572"],"references":["271469116_Lane_detection_algorithm_based_on_local_feature_extraction","264138742_Efficient_Real-time_Lane_Detection_Algorithm_Using_V-ROI","261398111_An_Adaptive_Road_ROI_Determination_Algorithm_for_Lane_Detection","257334033_Recent_progress_in_road_and_lane_detection_A_survey","251976676_Real-time_lane_detection_by_using_multiple_cues","228523677_Real-Time_Lane_Departure_Detection_Based_on_Extended_Edge-Linking_Algorithm","221324943_A_Simple_and_Efficient_Lane_Detection_using_Clustering_and_Weighted_Regression","221122148_Edlines_Real-time_line_segment_detection_by_Edge_Drawing_ED","283196148_Efficient_Lane_Detection_Based_on_Spatiotemporal_Images","268753284_Real-time_illumination_invariant_lane_detection_for_lane_departure_warning_system","260305328_Gradient-Enhancing_Conversion_for_Illumination-Robust_Lane_Detection","224650864_HSI_color_model_based_lane-marking_detection","224213965_Road_Lane_Detection_with_Improved_Canny_Edges_Using_Ant_Colony_Optimization","224167068_A_Novel_Lane_Detection_based_on_Geometrical_Model_and_Gabor_Filter","4370167_Real_time_Detection_of_Lane_Markers_in_Urban_Streets","4008033_Multitype_lane_markers_recognition_using_local_edge_direction","3427951_Video-Based_Lane_Estimation_and_Tracking_for_Driver_Assistance_Survey_System_and_Evaluation"]}
