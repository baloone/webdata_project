{"id":"326262191_Hybrid_Recognition_System_under_Feature_Selection_and_Fusion","abstract":"The study suggests a hybrid human recognition system based on face ear and palm print images. The aim of our study is to show the importance of biometric fusion for enhancement of the recognition rate. The system takes face images and segment them into face and ear. Then face, ear and palm images are extracted and fused. The FFBPNN followed by mahalanobis classifier is used in classification stage. The Experiments is applied on 5 databases with different illumination and pose variations and the best result obtained from the face-ear-palm fusion features with 97.5% recognition rate compared with 94.33% for face-ear fusion.","authors":["Ali Mayya","Mariam Saii"],"meta":["July 2017","Project: PhD Project"],"references":["303696808_Face_Iris_And_Fingerprint_Multimodal_Identification_System_Based_On_Local_Binary_Pattern_with_Variance_Histogram_and_Combined_Learning_Vector_Quantization","316558373_Human_identification_by_fusing_face_palm_iris","298429293_Multimodal_Recognition_Method_based_on_Ear_and_Profile_Face_Feature_Fusion","233835939_Multibiometric_human_recognition_using_3D_ear_and_face_features"]}
