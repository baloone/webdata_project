{"id":"3412138_Learning_and_communication_via_imitation_An_autonomous_robot_perspective","abstract":"This paper proposes a neural network architecture designed to\nexhibit learning and communication capabilities via imitation. Our\narchitecture allows a “protoimitation” behavior using the\n“perception ambiguity” inherent in real environments. In the\nperspective of turn-taking and gestural communication between two\nagents, new experiments on movement synchronization in an interaction\ngame are presented. Synchronization is obtained as a global attractor\ndepending on the coupling between agents' dynamics. We also discuss the\nunsupervised context of the imitation process and present new\nexperiments in which the same architecture is able to learn\nperception-action associations without any explicit reinforcement. The\nlearning is based on the ability to detect novelty or irregularities in\nthe communication rhythm","authors":["Pierre Andry","Philippe Gaussier","S.
