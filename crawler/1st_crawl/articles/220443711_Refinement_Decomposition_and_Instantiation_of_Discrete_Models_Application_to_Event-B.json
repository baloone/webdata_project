{"id":"220443711_Refinement_Decomposition_and_Instantiation_of_Discrete_Models_Application_to_Event-B","abstract":"We argue that formal modeling should be the starting point for any serious development of computer systems. This claim poses a challenge for modeling: at first it must cope with the constraints and scale of serious developments. Only then it is a suitable starting point. We present three techniques, refinement, decomposition, and instantiation, that we consider indispensable for modeling large and complex systems. The vehicle of our presentation is Event-B, but the techniques themselves do not depend on it.","authors":["Jean-Raymond Abrial","Stefan Hallerstede"],"meta":["April 2007Fundamenta Informaticae 77(1):1-28","SourceDBLP"],"references":["221501694_Refinement_Calculus_Part_I_Sequential_Nondeterministic_Programs","221501645_Refinement_Calculus_Part_II_Parallel_and_Reactive_Programs","221343351_Decentralization_of_Process_Nets_with_Centralized_Control","246136237_Experience_with_Isabelle_A_Generic_Theorem_Prover","240325471_The_Programming_Language_Oberon_Software-Practice_and_Experience","227886672_MODULA_a_language_for_modular_multiprogramming","225821479_Searching_by_elimination","224920590_Refinement_and_Reachability_in_Event_B","224001276_Isabelle_---_A_Generic_Theorem_Prover","222833380_Schellhorn_G_ASM_refinement_and_generalizations_of_forward_simulation_in_data_refinement_A_comparison_Theoretical_Computer_Science_3362-3_403-436"]}
