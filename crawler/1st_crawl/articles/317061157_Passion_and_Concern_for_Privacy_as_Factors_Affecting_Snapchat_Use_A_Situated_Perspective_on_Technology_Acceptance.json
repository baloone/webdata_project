{"id":"317061157_Passion_and_Concern_for_Privacy_as_Factors_Affecting_Snapchat_Use_A_Situated_Perspective_on_Technology_Acceptance","abstract":"This cross-sectional study explored the factors affecting Snapchat use, specifically the role of passion and concern for privacy in the acceptance of Snapchat. Partial least squares path-analysis was conducted using a path model based an extended Technology Acceptance Model (Davis, 1989) to gauge the contribution of Passion and Concern for Privacy for explaining Snapchat use. Only users who had experience using Snapchat completed the questionnaire. Responses were collected through personal networks over the 2016 year. The sample consisted of 69 females and 45 males. Respondents ranged from 16 to 50 years of ages, with the average being 22.57 years old (SD = 4.87) and were primarily located in North America. We find that Passion but not Concern for Privacy influenced Snapchat use. This study demonstrates that a situated perspective on technology acceptance provides a more complete account of Snapchat use. Implications of the situated perspective for technology acceptance modelling are discussed.","authors":["David Lemay","Tenzin Doleck","Paul Bazelais"],"meta":["May 2017Computers in Human Behavior 75","DOI:10.1016/j.chb.2017.05.022"],"references":["309233100_Parsons_Luhmann_and_the_Theorem_of_Double_Contingency","292211083_Building_acquaintance_brands_via_Snapchat_for_the_college_student_market","281440579_What_do_they_snapchat_about_Patterns_of_use_in_time-limited_instant_messaging_service","279181984_What_does_your_selfie_say_about_you","264934704_A_New_Criterion_for_Assessing_Discriminant_Validity_in_Variance-based_Structural_Equation_Modeling","262773475_Evaluating_Web_20_technologies_in_higher_education_using_students'_perceptions_and_performance","260037058_Common_Beliefs_and_Reality_About_PLS_Comments_on_Ronkko_and_Evermann_2013","257253044_Adolescents'_use_of_Instant_Messaging_as_a_means_of_emotional_relief","240691391_Parsons_Luhmann_and_the_Theorem_of_Double_Contingency","236033273_PLS-sem_Indeed_a_silver_bullet","227447282_A_Theoretical_Extension_of_the_Technology_Acceptance_Model_Four_Longitudinal_Field_Studies","227446117_User_Acceptance_of_Computer_Technology_A_Comparison_of_Two_Theoretical_Models","222431822_The_mediation_of_external_variables_in_the_technology_acceptance_model","222398924_Why_do_people_use_information_technology_A_critical_review_of_the_technology_acceptance_model","222297603_A_meta-analysis_of_the_Technology_Acceptance_Model","220259897_User_Acceptance_of_Information_Technology_Toward_a_Unified_View","49715965_The_Relationship_Between_Facebook_and_the_Well-Being_of_Undergraduate_College_Students","312984568_Perceived_usefulness_perceived_ease_and_user_acceptance_of_information_technology","301650151_Snapchat_is_more_personal_An_exploratory_study_on_Snapchat_behaviors_and_young_adult_interpersonal_relationships","288889592_Sexual_intensity_of_adolescents'_online_self-presentations_Joint_contribution_of_identity_media_consumption_and_extraversion","288686600_The_impact_of_communication_technologies_on_life_and_relationship_satisfaction","286378526_Getting_acquainted_with_social_networks_and_apps_Snapchat_and_the_rise_of_ephemeral_communication","281746337_Exploring_the_role_of_social_networking_sites_within_adolescent_romantic_relationships_and_dating_experiences","281676178_Research_on_SNS_and_education_The_state_of_the_art_and_its_challenges","280627192_Benefit-Confirmation_Model_for_Post-Adoption_Behavior_of_Mobile_Instant_Messaging_Applications_A_Comparative_Analysis_of_KakaoTalk_and_Joyn_in_Korea","276365274_Selfie_posting_behaviors_are_associated_with_narcissism_among_men","273851940_Investigating_factors_affecting_social_presence_and_user_satisfaction_with_Mobile_Instant_Messaging","257253011_Young_people's_digital_lives_The_impact_of_interpersonal_relationships_and_digital_media_use_on_adolescents'_sense_of_identity","242378103_Soft_Modeling_The_Basic_Design_and_Some_Extensions","237202324_Evaluating_Structural_Equation_Models_With_Unobservable_Variable_Sand_Measurement_Error","235361368_A_Paradigm_For_Developing_Better_Measures_Of_Marketing_Constructs","229475752_Use_of_Partial_Least_Squares_PLS_in_Strategic_Management_Research","222576302_On_Luhmann_Contingency_risk_trust_and_reflection","222422659_Using_the_Technology_Acceptance_Model_to_Explain_How_Attitudes_Determine_Internet_Usage","222411279_A_meta-analysis_of_the_technology_acceptance_model_Investigating_subjective_norm_and_moderation_effects","222397739_The_Role_of_Moderating_Factors_in_User_Technology_Acceptance","220079739_Todd_P_Understanding_Information_Technology_Usage_A_Test_of_Competing_Models_Information_Systems_Research_62_144-176","9049555_Les_Passions_De_L'ame_On_Obsessive_and_Harmonious_Passion"]}
