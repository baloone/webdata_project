{"id":"257022275_On_the_Rate_of_Convergence_of_Kirk-Type_Iterative_Schemes","abstract":"The purpose of this paper is to introduce Kirk-type new iterative schemes called\nKirk-SP and Kirk-CR schemes and to study the convergence of these iterative\nschemes by employing certain quasi-contractive operators. By taking an example,\nwe will compare Kirk-SP, Kirk-CR, Kirk-Mann, Kirk-Ishikawa, and Kirk-Noor\niterative schemes for aforementioned class of operators. Also, using computer\nprograms in C++, we compare the above-mentioned iterative schemes through\nexamples of increasing, decreasing, sublinear, superlinear, and oscillatory\nfunctions.","authors":["Nawab Hussain","Renu Chugh","Vivek Kumar","Arif Rafiq"],"meta":["July 2012Journal of Applied Mathematics 2012(1110-757X):22","DOI:10.1155/2012/526503"],"references":["276541665_Strong_Convergence_of_a_New_Three_Step_Iterative_Scheme_in_Banach_Spaces","266222426_Stability_of_Hybrid_Fixed_Point_Iterative_Algorithms_of_Kirk-Noor_Type_in_Normed_Linear_Space_for_Self_and_Nonself_Operators","260318677_Strong_Convergence_of_SP_Iterative_Scheme_for_Quasi-_Contractive_Operators","257878255_On_rate_of_convergence_of_various_iterative_schemes","303495043_Fixed_point_by_a_new_iteration_method","289214894_On_the_convergence_of_three-step_iteration_process_with_errors_in_the_class_of_quasi-contractive_operators","268247349_Iterative_Approximation_of_Fixed_Points","268161859_Faster_Noor_iterations","266282836_A_new_approach_in_numerical_praxis","245702179_Comments_on_Two_Fixed_Point_Iteration_Methods"]}
