{"id":"282403230_Efficiently_Finding_All_Maximal_alpha-gapped_Repeats","abstract":"For $\\alpha\\geq 1$, an $\\alpha$-gapped repeat in a word $w$ is a factor $uvu$\nof $w$ such that $|uv|\\leq \\alpha |u|$; the two factors $u$ in such a repeat\nare called arms, while the factor $v$ is called gap. Such a repeat is called\nmaximal if its arms cannot be extended simultaneously with the same symbol to\nthe right or, respectively, to the left. In this paper we show that the number\nof maximal $\\alpha$-gapped repeats that may occur in a word is upper bounded by\n$18\\alpha n$. This allows us to construct an algorithm finding all the maximal\n$\\alpha$-gapped repeats of a word in $O(\\alpha n)$; this is optimal, in the\nworst case, as there are words that have $\\Theta(\\alpha n)$ maximal\n$\\alpha$-gapped repeats. Our techniques can be extended to get comparable\nresults in the case of $\\alpha$-gapped palindromes, i.e., factors\n$uvu^\\mathrm{T}$ with $|uv|\\leq \\alpha |u|$.","authors":["Pawel Gawrychowski","Tomohiro I","Shunsuke Inenaga","Dominik KÃ¶ppl"],"meta":["September 2015","SourcearXiv"],"references":["284579161_Longest_Gapped_Repeats_and_Palindromes","256606518_Searching_of_Gapped_Repeats_and_Subrepetitions_in_a_Word","221513049_Efficient_Algorithms_for_Two_Extensions_of_LPF_Table_The_Power_of_Suffix_Arrays","221314014_Finding_Maximal_Pairs_With_Bounded_Gap","319394814_Algorithms_on_strings_trees_and_sequences_computer_science_and_computational_biology","313101772_Efficient_algorithms_for_two_extensions_of_LPF_table_The_power_of_suffix_arrays","300569498_Longest_alpha_a_-Gapped_Repeat_and_Palindrome","283524587_A_faster_algorithm_for_computing_maximal_a-gapped_repeats_in_a_string","281486611_Optimal_searching_of_gapped_repeats_in_a_word","227026137_Searching_for_Gapped_Palindromes"]}
