{"id":"276949937_Differential_Association_and_Containment_Theory_A_Theoretical_Convergence","abstract":"It is argued that the work of Reckless and Dinitz concerning the socialization and self-concepts of “good” boys and “potential” delinquents offers the basis for a test and extension of the theory of differential association. This position is based on recognition that these investigators, like Sutherland, emphasized socialization processes; to explain the non-delinquent Reckless and Dinitz rely on the same mechanisms Sutherland employed to explain the delinquent.\nIn the analysis of data obtained in Honolulu it was found that the joint effects of the measures of differential association and socialization proposed, respectively, by Short and Reckless and Dinitz, account for delinquent behavior more fully than does the separate effect of either measure. While they overlap considerably, the use of both measures accounts for delinquent behavior, defined according to official and unofficial criteria, more fully than does either measure treated singly.","authors":["Harwin L.
