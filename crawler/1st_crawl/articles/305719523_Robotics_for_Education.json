{"id":"305719523_Robotics_for_Education","abstract":"Educational robotics programs have become popular in most developed countries and are becoming more and more prevalent in the developing world as well. Robotics is used to teach problem solving, programming, design, physics, math and even music and art to students at all levels of their education. This chapter provides an overview of some of the major robotics programs along with the robot platforms and the programming environments commonly used. Like robot systems used in research, there is a constant development and upgrade of hardware and software â€“ so this chapter provides a snapshot of the technologies being used at this time. The chapter concludes with a review of the assessment strategies that can be used to determine if a particular robotics program is benefitting students in the intended ways.","authors":["David P Miller","Illah Nourbakhsh"],"meta":["January 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-32552-1_79"],"references":["284569853_Describing_and_Supporting_Collaborative_Scientific_Thinking_in_Parent-Child_Interactions","274309848_Computational_Thinking","254746050_Objects_of_Learning_Objects_of_Talk_Changing_Minds_in_Museums","242467788_To_Mindstorms_and_Beyond_Evolution_of_a_Construction_Kit_for_Magical_Machines","241625431_Using_gliders_to_study_a_phytoplankton_bloom_in_the_Ross_Sea_Antarctica","236577449_Robotics_Olympiads_A_New_Means_to_Integrate_Theory_and_Practice_in_Robotics","234803984_Joining_computing_and_the_arts_at_a_mid-size_university","228918259_The_impact_of_robot_projects_on_girls'_attitudes_toward_science_and_engineering","227603229_Shared_Scientific_Thinking_in_Everyday_Parent-Child_Activity","225238919_The_Robotic_Autonomy_Mobile_Robotics_Course_Robot_Design_Curriculum_Design_and_Educational_Assessment","224155972_A_Simple_Learning_Strategy_for_High-Speed_Quadrocopter_Multi-Flips","221250550_Artbotics_Combining_Art_and_Robotics_to_Broaden_Participation_in_Computing","220426817_Scratch_Programming_for_All","200026266_Where_the_Action_Is_The_Foundations_of_Embodied_Interaction","344251919_Programming_Robots_in_Kindergarten_to_Express_Identity","307815784_Teaching_design_and_project_management_with_lego_RCX_robots","304160366_Archaeology_via_Underwater_Robots_Mapping_and_Localization_within_Maltese_Cistern_Systems","267831339_Designing_the_Finch_Creating_a_Robot_Aligned_to_Computer_Science_Concepts","267653398_Mobile_robots_Inspiration_to_implementation_2nd_ed","262405599_Developing_a_hardware_and_programming_curriculum_for_middle_school_girls","262152333_Ten_years_of_the_AAAI_mobile_robot_competition_and_exhibition_Looking_back_and_to_the_future","260696236_Robot_Contests_at_GCER_2011_Competitions","259617880_EventScope_a_telescience_interface_for_Internet-based_education","255786198_Multirotor_Aerial_Vehicles_Modeling_Estimation_and_Control_of_Quadrotor","246482972_Instructional_Alignment_Searching_for_a_Magic_Bullet","246366190_Heuristic_evaluation_of_users_interfaces-Proc","245766468_Problem-based_learning_PBL","243776774_Robotic_Explorations_A_Hands-On_Introduction_to_Engineering","243768386_The_Trinity_College_fire_fighting_home_robot_contest","243766781_Botball_Autonomous_students_engineering_autonomous_robots","242560724_The_Power_of_Problem-Based_Learning","240099722_Looking_for_Learning_in_Visitor_Talk_A_Methodological_Exploration","238122690_Heuristic_Evaluation_In_Usability_Inspection_Methods","237295432_Retention_101_Where_Robots_GoStudents_Follow","236577471_So_that's_what_Pi_is_for_and_other_educational_epiphanies_from_hands-on_robotics","236234707_A_Survey_of_Socially_Interactive_Robots","233566426_The_Personal_Exploration_Rover_Educational_Assessment_Of_A_Robotic_Exhibit_For_Informal_Learning_Venues","232597379_Piaget's_Theory_of_Cognitive_and_Affective_Development_Foundations_of_Constructivism","230854723_The_Gamification_of_Learning","228879288_Botball_robotics_and_gender_differences_in_middle_school_teams","224155893_The_CBC_A_LINUX-based_low-cost_mobile_robot_controller","224001112_Heuristic_Evaluation","222839878_Worked-out_examples_Instructional_explanations_support_learning_by_self-explanations","221538453_A_strategy_for_collaborative_outreach_lessons_from_the_CSbots_project","221251153_Robot_Diaries_Broadening_Participation_in_the_Computer_Science_Pipeline_through_Social_Technical_Exploration","220604444_Using_Robot_Competitions_to_Promote_Intellectual_Development","220425780_Using_Autonomous_Robotics_to_Teach_Science_and_Engineering","215772432_RoboCup_2004_Robot_Soccer_World_Cup_VIII","37425164_Robota_Clever_Toy_and_Educational_Tool","29466312_Digital_Natives_Come_to_Preschool_Implications_for_Early_Childhood_Practice","6357109_Digital_Childhood_Electronic_Media_and_Technology_Use_Among_Infants_Toddlers_and_Preschoolers","3923404_Robotics_learning_as_a_tool_for_integrating_science_technologycurriculum_in_K-12_schools","4054731_Principles_and_experiences_in_using_Legos_to_teach_behavioral_robotics","3981465_LEGO_robotics_products_boost_student_creativity_in_precollege_programs_at_UMES","3923312_Teaching_freshmen_design_creativity_and_programming_with_LEGOs_and_Labview"]}
