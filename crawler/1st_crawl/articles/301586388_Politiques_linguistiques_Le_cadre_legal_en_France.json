{"id":"301586388_Politiques_linguistiques_Le_cadre_legal_en_France","abstract":"This paper proposes an intelligible picture of the constitutional, legal and regulatory framework in which the \" Langues de France \" are considered (\"Langues de France\" is the formal designation for the languages spoken on the territory, other than French, that are taken as part of the national heritage). The objective is to present the state of affairs in a way which should make it more easily understood by linguists, students and interested persons. We don't present the situation in legal terms, but rather try to identify the general principles that govern the texts, as well as the provisions applying to a few specific areas.","authors":["Denis Costaouec"],"meta":["February 2013"],"references":[]}
