{"id":"344294869_Modelling_and_Planning_Evolution_Styles_in_Software_Architecture","abstract":"The purpose of this study is to find the right model to plan and predict future evolution paths of an evolving software architecture based on past evolution data. Thus, in this paper, a model to represent the software architecture evolution process is defined. In order to collect evolution data, a simple formalism allowing to easily express software architecture evolution data is introduced. The sequential pattern extraction technique is applied to the collected evolution styles of an evolving software architecture in order to predict and plan the future evolution paths. A learning and prediction model is defined to generate the software architecture possible future evolution paths. A method for evaluating the generated paths is presented. In addition, we explain and validate our approach through a study on two examples of evolution of component-oriented software architecture.","authors":["Djibo Kadidiatou","Mourad Chabane Oussalah","Jacqueline Konate"],"meta":["September 2020","DOI:10.3390/modelling1010004"],"references":["335152125_A_Systematic_Mapping_on_Visual_Solutions_to_Support_the_Comprehension_of_Software_Architecture_Evolution","317148728_Analyzing_Software_Evolution_and_Quality_by_Extracting_Asynchrony_Change_patterns","265688207_The_Use_of_Sequential_Pattern_Mining_to_Predict_Next_Prescribed_Medications","337240071_Developing_an_evolution_software_architecture_framework_based_on_six_dimensions","324217652_Evolution_Styles_Multi-ViewMulti-Level_Model_for_Software_Architecture_Evolution","319393506_Mining_Sequential_Patterns_Generalizations_and_Performance_Improvements","312702768_Meta-Evolution_Style_for_Software_Architecture_Evolution","304456780_CRoM_and_HuspExt_Improving_efficiency_of_high_utility_sequential_pattern_extraction","278247227_An_efficient_algorithm_for_mining_frequent_sequences_by_a_new_strategy_without_support_counting","262238973_Algorithms_for_Context_Based_Sequential_Pattern_Mining","235246737_Sequential_Pattern_Mining_Approaches_and_Algorithms","233810960_Evolution_styles_Using_architectural_knowledge_as_an_evolution_driver","231548799_Graph-based_Discovery_of_Ontology_Change_Patterns","230579420_Software_Evolution_Prediction_Using_Seasonal_Time_Analysis_A_Comparative_Study","261276651_Automated_planning_for_software_architecture_evolution"]}
