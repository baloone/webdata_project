{"id":"260720052_Distributed_Temperature_Sensing_in_Polymer_Optical_Fiber_by_BOFDA","abstract":"Distributed temperature measurements in a perfluorinated graded-index polymer optical fiber (POF) with 50-$mu{rm m}$ core diameter are reported for the first time, to the best of our knowledge. Brillouin optical frequency-domain analysis is shown to be able to resolve spatially the temperature-dependent Brillouin frequency shift profile along a 20-m POF fiber sample, at a nominal spatial resolution of 4 m. The results indicate that POFs are potentially useful for distributed temperature measurements based on stimulated Brillouin scattering.","authors":["Aldo Minardo","Romeo Bernini","Luigi Zeni"],"meta":["February 2014IEEE Photonics Technology Letters 26(4):387-390","DOI:10.1109/LPT.2013.2294878"],"references":["254019102_Distributed_Sensing_at_Centimeter-Scale_Spatial_Resolution_by_BOFDA_Measurements_and_Signal_Processing","236599252_Brillouin_scattering_signal_in_polymer_optical_fiber_enhanced_by_exploiting_pulsed_pump_with_multimode-fiber-assisted_coupling_technique","234921126_Experimental_study_of_Brillouin_scattering_in_perfluorinated_polymer_optical_fiber_at_telecommunication_wavelength","232086761_Brillouin_gain_spectrum_dependence_on_large_strain_in_perfluorinated_graded-index_polymer_optical_fiber","51231470_Observation_of_stimulated_Brillouin_scattering_in_polymer_optical_fiber_with_pump-probe_technique","49651661_Potential_of_Brillouin_scattering_in_polymer_optical_fiber_for_strain-insensitive_high-accuracy_temperature_sensing","252057043_Brillouin_Gain_Spectrum_Characterization_in_Perfluorinated_Graded-Index_Polymer_Optical_Fiber_With_625-_mum_Core_Diameter","38054814_Distributed_sensing_technique_based_on_Brillouin_optical-fiber_frequency-domain_analysis","8259241_Stimulated_Brillouin_scattering_frequency-domain_analysis_in_a_single-mode_optical_fiber_for_distributed_sensing","3292379_Accuracy_Enhancement_in_Brillouin_Distributed_Fiber-Optic_Temperature_Sensors_Using_Signal_Processing_Techniques","2969638_Direct_Frequency_Modulation_In_AlGaAs_Semiconductor_Lasers"]}
