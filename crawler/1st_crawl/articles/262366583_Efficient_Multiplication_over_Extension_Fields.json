{"id":"262366583_Efficient_Multiplication_over_Extension_Fields","abstract":"The efficiency of cryptographic protocols rely on the speed of the underlying arithmetic and finite field computation. In the literature, several methods on how to improve the multiplication over extensions fields \\(\\mathbb{F}_{q^{m}}\\), for prime q were developped. These optimisations are often related to the Karatsuba and Toom Cook methods. However, the speeding-up is only interesting when m is a product of powers of 2 and 3. In general cases, a fast multiplication over \\(\\mathbb{F}_{q^{m}}\\) is implemented through the use of the naive school-book method. In this paper, we propose a new efficient multiplication over \\(\\mathbb{F}_{q^{m}}\\) for any power m. The multiplication relies on the notion of Adapted Modular Number System (AMNS), introduced in 2004 by [3]. We improve the construction of an AMNS basis and we provide a fast implementation of the multiplication over \\(\\mathbb{F}_{q^{m}}\\), which is faster than GMP and NTL.","authors":["Nadia El Mrabet","Nicolas Gama"],"meta":["July 2012","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-31662-3_10","Conference: Proceedings of the 4th international conference on Arithmetic of Finite Fields"],"references":["238747500_A_hierarchy_of_polynomial_time_basis_reduction_algorithms","227128293_Use_of_Elliptic_Curves_in_Cryptography","226499611_Lattice_Basis_Reduction_Improved_Practical_Algorithms_and_Solving_Subset_Sum_Problems","308038378_Use_of_elliptic_curves_in_cryptography_Advance_in_Cryptology_CRYPTO","268914742_Geometrie_der_Zahlen_Unveranderter_Nachdruck_der_1_Auflage","264945958_Modern_Computer_Algebra","262329993_Regular_Article_Rings_of_Low_Multiplicative_Complexity","248247711_Use_of_elliptic_curves_in_cryptology","247933987_The_Number_Theory_Library","226565834_Lattice_basis_reduction_Improved_practical_algorithms_and_solving_subset_sum_problems","225112259_Efficient_Multiplication_in_Finite_Field_Extensions_of_Degree_5","225671744_Identity-Based_Encryption_from_the_Weil_Pairing","225344959_More_Generalized_Mersenne_Numbers","221348542_Implementing_Gentry's_Fully-Homomorphic_Encryption_Scheme","221348521_Predicting_Lattice_Reduction"]}
