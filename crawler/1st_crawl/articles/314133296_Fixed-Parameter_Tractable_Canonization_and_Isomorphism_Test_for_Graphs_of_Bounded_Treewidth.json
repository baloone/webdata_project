The running time of the algorithm on an $n$-vertex graph is $2^{\\mathcal{O}(k^5\\log k)}\\cdot n^5$, and this is the first fixed-parameter algorithm for Graph Isomorphism parameterized by treewidth. Our algorithm in fact solves the more general canonization problem. We namely design a procedure working in $2^{\\mathcal{O}(k^5\\log k)}\\cdot n^5$ time that, for a given graph $G$ on $n$ vertices, either concludes that the treewidth of $G$ is at least $k$ or (i) finds in an isomorphic-invariant way a graph $\\mathfrak{c}(G)$ that is isomorphic to $G$; (ii) finds an isomorphism-invariant construction term---an algebraic expression that encodes $G$ together with a tree decomposition of $G$ of width less than $k$. Hence, the isomorphism test reduces to verifying whether the computed isomorphic copi...","authors":["Daniel Lokshtanov","Marcin Pilipczuk","Micha≈Ç Pilipczuk","Saket Saurabh"],"meta":["January 2017SIAM Journal on Computing 46(1):161-189","DOI:10.1137/140999980"],"references":["232906068_Myhill-Nerode_Methods_for_Hypergraphs","2640847_Isomorphism_for_Graphs_of_Bounded_Distance_Width"]}
