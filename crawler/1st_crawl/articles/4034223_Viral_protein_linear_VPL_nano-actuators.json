{"id":"4034223_Viral_protein_linear_VPL_nano-actuators","abstract":"A new nanoscale biomolecular motor is introduced. The Viral Protein Linear (VPL) Motor. The motor is based on a conformational change observed in a family of viral envelope proteins when a virus attempts to infect a cell by the process of membrane fusion. By developing similar proteins in vitro and subjecting them to appropriate conditions, a similar conformational change can be observed and controlled. The conformational change produces a motion of about 10 nm, making the VPL a basic linear actuator which can be further interfaced with other organic/inorganic nanoscale components such as DNA actuators and carbon nanotubes.","authors":["Atul Dubey","Constantinos Mavroidis","A.
