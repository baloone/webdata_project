{"id":"329211127_Analysis_of_the_essential_factors_affecting_of_intention_to_use_of_mobile_learning_applications_A_comparison_between_universities_adopters_and_non-adopters","abstract":"Although mobile learning systems offer several benefits for students, academic staff\nand universities, from easily access and learning anywhere and anytime, the use and\nacceptance of this new technology in Jordan still very low. However, acceptance of\nmobile learning by students is crucial to the success of mobile learning. The factors that\naffect the use and user acceptance of mobile learning are still controversial. Thus, this\nstudy mainly proposes an integrated model, with the aim of identifying the most\ninfluential factors that may encourage or impede students and universities in Jordan\nin moving towards acceptance and adoption of mobile learning applications. The\nproposed model was evaluated empirically with 1200 students from both two groups\nof universities that already used the mobile learning technology and non-adopters\nuniversities in Jordan. The model aims to examine the impact of 11 factors on the\nadoption of mobile learning applications that were categorised based on four fundamental\nconstructs are: (i) technological factors (security, privacy, compatibility, relative\nadvantage and trust), (ii) organizational factors (resistance to change and technology\nreadiness), (iii) cultural factors and (iv) quality factors (quality of system, quality of\ncontent and quality of service). The key findings include: (1) resistance to change,\nsecurity and privacy concerns still limit mobile learning acceptance and adoption in\nJordanian universities; (2) some factors like compatibility, technology readiness, and\nculture were found to have a negative effect on the intention to use of the mobile\nlearning; (3) five factors (relative advantage, trust, quality of system, quality of content\nand quality of service) were found to have a positive effect on the intention to use of the\nmobile learning; and (4) our research also found that the effect of these factors differed\nin universities that already used the mobile learning and non-adopters. Finally, it is\nexpected that the findings of this research can assist university decision makers, mobile\nlearning application providers and the research community in introducing","authors":["Mohammed Amin Almaiah د. محمد أمين المعايعة","Ahmed Al Mulhem"],"meta":["March 2019Education and Information Technologies 24(4)","DOI:10.1007/s10639-018-9840-1","Project: Mobile Learning Acceptance"],"references":["329031114_Proposing_a_new_technical_quality_requiremnts_framework_for_mobile_learning_applications","327673054_Examination_of_factors_influencing_the_use_of_mobile_learning_system_An_empirical_study","327673003_A_conceptual_framework_for_determining_the_success_factors_of_E-learning_system_implementation_using_Delphi_technique","323300195_Acceptance_and_usage_of_a_mobile_information_system_services_in_University_of_Jordan","321086831_Exploring_the_effects_of_a_non-interactive_talking_avatar_on_social_presence_credibility_trust_and_patronage_intention_in_an_e-commerce_website","315629196_Smart_home_services_as_the_next_mainstream_of_the_ICT_industry_determinants_of_the_adoption_of_smart_home_services","329256675_Structural_Equation_Models_with_Unobservable_Variables_and_Measurement_Error_Algebra_and_Statistics","314247819_Affordances_and_Constraints_of_BYOD_Bring_Your_Own_Device_for_Learning_in_Higher_Education_Teachers'_Perspectives","313948854_A_location-based_privacy-preserving_m-learning_model_to_enhance_distance_education_in_Kenya","313604424_Evaluating_Structural_Equation_Models_with_Unobservable_Variables_and_Measurement_Error","311904678_How_Environmental_Uncertainty_Moderates_the_Effect_of_Relative_Advantage_and_Perceived_Credibility_on_the_Adoption_of_Mobile_Health_Services_by_Chinese_Organizations_in_the_Big_Data_Era","311790238_Preliminary_study_for_exploring_the_major_problems_and_activities_of_mobile_learning_system_A_case_study_of_Jordan","313177619_The_Delone_and_Mclean_information_system_success_A_ten_years_update","312984568_Perceived_usefulness_perceived_ease_and_user_acceptance_of_information_technology","312613995_On_the_Evaluation_of_Structural_Equation_Models"]}
