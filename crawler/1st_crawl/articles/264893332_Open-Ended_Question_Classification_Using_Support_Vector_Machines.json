{"id":"264893332_Open-Ended_Question_Classification_Using_Support_Vector_Machines","abstract":"Open-ended questions require a more descriptive response than do closed-ended questions. Questions of this type can be broken down into categories that identify the format and content of the expected response. Accurate classification of open-ended questions can lead to more appropriate responses from question-answering systems and other intelligent systems â€“ leading to better human/computer interaction. This paper demonstrates how support vector machines (SVM) are used successfully in the classification of open-ended questions.","authors":["Jim Bullington","Ira Endres","Muhammad Asadur Rahman"],"meta":[],"references":["226658534_A_Tutorial_on_Support_Vector_Machines_for_Pattern_Recognition","228907460_Text_Categorization_with_Support_Vector_Machines_How_to_Represent_Texts_in_Input_Space","221299024_Question_classification_using_support_vector_machines","220694713_Statistical_Learning_Theory","28355923_Making_large-scale_SVM_Learning_Practical","2381208_A_Statistical_Learning_Model_of_Text_Classification_for_Support_Vector_Machines"]}
