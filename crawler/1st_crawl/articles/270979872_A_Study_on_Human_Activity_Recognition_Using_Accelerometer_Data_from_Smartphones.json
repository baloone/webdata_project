{"id":"270979872_A_Study_on_Human_Activity_Recognition_Using_Accelerometer_Data_from_Smartphones","abstract":"This paper describes how to recognize certain types of human physical activities using acceleration data generated by a user's cell phone. We propose a recognition system in which a new digital low-pass filter is designed in order to isolate the component of gravity acceleration from that of body acceleration in the raw data. The system was trained and tested in an experiment with multiple human subjects in real-world conditions. Several classifiers were tested using various statistical features. High-frequency and low-frequency components of the data were taken into account. We selected five classifiers each offering good performance for recognizing our set of activities and investigated how to combine them into an optimal set of classifiers. We found that using the average of probabilities as the fusion method could reach an overall accuracy rate of 91.15%.","authors":["Akram Bayat","Marc Pomplun","Duc Tran"],"meta":["December 2014Procedia Computer Science 34:450-457","DOI:10.1016/j.procs.2014.07.009"],"references":["225161052_Motion_pattern_and_posture_Correctly_assessed_by_calibrated_accelerometers","224194512_Cell_Phone-Based_Biometric_Identification","224144394_A_Triaxial_Accelerometer-Based_Physical-Activity_Recognition_via_Augmented-Signal_Features_and_a_Hierarchical_Recognizer","221604452_Activity_Recognition_from_Accelerometer_Data","221258784_Human_Activity_Recognition_from_Accelerometer_Data_Using_a_Wearable_Device","248338399_Vision-Based_Human_Tracking_and_Activity_Recognition","239920951_Real_time_human_activity_recognition_using_tri-axial_accelerometers","225190192_A_Practical_Approach_to_Recognizing_Physical_Activities","221516284_iPhone_as_a_physical_activity_measurement_platform","221016026_Activity_Recognition_from_User-Annotated_Acceleration_Data","220520200_Activity_Recognition_Using_Cell_Phone_Accelerometers","51970052_Machine_Learning_Methods_for_Classifying_Human_Physical_Activity_from_On-Body_Accelerometers","51451055_Identifying_Types_of_Physical_Activity_With_a_Single_Accelerometer_Evaluating_Laboratory-trained_Algorithms_in_Daily_Life","220611909_Poppe_R_A_Survey_on_Vision-based_Human_Action_Recognition_Image_and_Vision_Computing_286_976-990","220338325_Classifier_selection_for_majority_voting"]}
