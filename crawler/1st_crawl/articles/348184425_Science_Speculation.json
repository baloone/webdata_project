{"id":"348184425_Science_Speculation","abstract":"Despite wide recognition that speculation is critical for successful science, philosophers have attended little to it. When they have, speculation has been characterized in narrowly epistemic terms: a hypothesis is speculative due to its (lack of) evidential support. These ‘evidence-first’ accounts provide little guidance for what makes speculation productive or egregious, nor how to foster the former while avoiding the latter. I examine how scientists discuss speculation and identify various functions speculations play. On this basis, I develop a ‘function-first’ account of speculation. This analysis grounds a richer discussion of when speculation is egregious and when it is productive, based in both fine-grained analysis of the speculation’s purpose, and what I call the ‘epistemic situation’ scientists face.","authors":["Adrian Currie"],"meta":["March 2021Erkenntnis","DOI:10.1007/s10670-020-00370-w"],"references":["347653618_Creativity_in_science_and_the_'anthropological_turn'_in_virtue_theory","337437496_Two_conceptions_of_the_sources_of_conservatism_in_scientific_research","334214900_Epistemic_Optimism_Speculation_and_the_Historical_Sciences","334209728_Speculation_in_the_Historical_Sciences","331543392_Simplicity_One-Shot_Hypotheses_Paleobiological_Explanation","351669926_Creativity_in_the_Social_Epistemology_of_Science","346383090_Visibility_creativity_and_collective_working_practices_in_art_and_science","345128407_'Of_Water_Drops_and_Atomic_Nuclei_Analogies_and_Pursuit_Worthiness_in_Science'","343976623_Comparative_Thinking_in_Biology","339337264_Against_Morgan's_Canon"]}
