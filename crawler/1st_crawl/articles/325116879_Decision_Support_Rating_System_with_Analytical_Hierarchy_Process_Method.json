{"id":"325116879_Decision_Support_Rating_System_with_Analytical_Hierarchy_Process_Method","abstract":"Human resources within a company's organization are significant to support the progress and quality of the company in achieving the goal. However, to achieve it all of these employees must have other supporting factors such as endurance, diligence, and accuracy or other skills. These factors can manage a system that can help to make decisions. One of the methods that can be used for decision support system is by using AHP (Analytical Hierarchy Process) method, this method is chosen because it can select the best alternative from a number of alternatives that is entitled to get the promotion and value of employee performance expected by company based on criteria which are determined. The result of the implementation process can sort the alternatives from the most considerable value to the smallest value.","authors":["Muhammad Dharma Tuah Putra Nasution","Yossie Rossanty","Achmad Daengs GS","S Sahat"],"meta":["March 2018International Journal of Engineering & Technology 7(2.3):105","DOI:10.14419/ijet.v7i2.3.12629"],"references":["326415570_Lecturers'_Understanding_on_Indexing_Databases_of_SINTA_DOAJ_Google_Scholar_SCOPUS_and_Web_of_Science_A_Study_of_Indonesians","325117665_A_Comparison_of_a-Sutte_Indicator_and_ARIMA_Methods_in_Renewable_Energy_Forecasting_in_Indonesia","324690496_Predicting_Network_Faults_using_Random_Forest_and_C50","324280829_Conceptual_Framework_for_Stock_Market_Classification_Model_Using_Sentiment_Analysis_on_Twitter_Based_on_Hybrid_Naive_Bayes_Classifiers","324052734_Support_vector_machine_in_the_anticipation_of_currency_markets","323338879_Block_Architecture_Problem_with_Depth_First_Search_Solution_and_Its_Application","323338837_Keylogger_Application_to_Monitoring_Users_Activity_with_Exact_String_Matching_Algorithm","323336704_Analysis_of_Student_Satisfaction_Toward_Quality_of_Service_Facility","322687319_Modeling_Data_Containing_Outliers_using_ARIMA_Additive_Outlier_ARIMA-AO_Modeling_Data_Containing_Outliers_using_ARIMA_Additive_Outlier_ARIMA-AO","321800091_Comparative_Analysis_of_Membership_Function_on_Mamdani_Fuzzy_Inference_System_for_Decision_Making","321800010_Data_Collision_Prevention_with_Overflow_Hashing_Technique_in_Closed_Hash_Searching_Process","321799910_Comparison_Searching_Process_of_Linear_Binary_and_Interpolation_Algorithm","321799147_Research_of_Simple_Multi-Attribute_Rating_Technique_for_Decision_Support","321798856_Visual_Approach_of_Searching_Process_using_Boyer-Moore_Algorithm","321537606_An_evaluation_model_for_the_implementation_of_hospital_information_system_in_public_hospitals_using_multi-criteria-decision-making_MCDM_approaches","320061261_Forecasting_of_primary_energy_consumption_data_in_the_United_States_A_comparison_between_ARIMA_and_Holter-Winters_models","319985493_Double_hashing_technique_in_closed_hashing_search_process","314952722_Decision_Support_System_Best_Employee_Assessments_with_Technique_for_Order_of_Preference_by_Similarity_to_Ideal_Solution","301774809_Profile_Matching_and_Competency_Based_Human_Resources_Management_Approaches_for_Employee_Placement_Decision_Support_System_Case_Study","238195934_Analytical_Hierarchy_Process_as_a_tool_for_selecting_and_evaluating_projects","324532947_A_slack-based_measures_for_improving_the_efficiency_performance_of_departments_in_Universitas_Malikussaleh","324054153_Optimizing_performance_of_fuzzy_decision_support_system_with_multiple_parameter_dependency_for_cloud_provider_evaluation","299822611_Multi-criteria_decision_making_approaches_for_supplier_evaluation_and_selection_A_literature_review","292718465_Strategic_human_resource_management","284045490_Use_of_Analytical_Hierarchy_Process_AHP_for_Selecting_The_Best_Design_Concept","257471776_Clarifying_the_construct_of_human_resource_systems_Relating_human_resource_management_to_employee_performance","254300423_Recruitment_and_selection_services_Efficiency_and_competitive_reasons_in_the_outsourcing_of_HR_practices"]}
