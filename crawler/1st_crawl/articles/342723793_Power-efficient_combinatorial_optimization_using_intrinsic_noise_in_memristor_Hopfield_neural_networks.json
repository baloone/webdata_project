{"id":"342723793_Power-efficient_combinatorial_optimization_using_intrinsic_noise_in_memristor_Hopfield_neural_networks","abstract":"To tackle important combinatorial optimization problems, a variety of annealing-inspired computing accelerators, based on several different technology platforms, have been proposed, including quantum-, optical- and electronics-based approaches. However, to be of use in industrial applications, further improvements in speed and energy efficiency are necessary. Here, we report a memristor-based annealing system that uses an energy-efficient neuromorphic architecture based on a Hopfield neural network. Our analogueâ€“digital computing approach creates an optimization solver in which massively parallel operations are performed in a dense crossbar array that can inject the needed computational noise through the analogue array and device errors, amplified or dampened by using a novel feedback algorithm. We experimentally show that the approach can solve non-deterministic polynomial-time (NP)-hard max-cut problems by harnessing the intrinsic hardware noise. We also use experimentally grounded simulations to explore scalability with problem size, which suggest that our memristor-based approach can offer a solution throughput over four orders of magnitude higher per power consumption relative to current quantum, optical and fully digital approaches. A memristor-based annealing system that uses an analogue neuromorphic architecture based on a Hopfield neural network can solve non-deterministic polynomial (NP)-hard max-cut problems in an approach that is potentially more efficient than current quantum, optical and digital approaches.","authors":["Fuxi Cai","Suhas Kumar","Thomas Van Vaerenbergh","Xia Sheng"],"meta":["July 2020Nature Electronics 3(7):1-10","DOI:10.1038/s41928-020-0436-6"],"references":["338579627_Heuristic_recurrent_algorithms_for_photonic_Ising_machines","336379581_A_flexible_high-performance_simulator_for_verifying_and_benchmarking_quantum_circuits_implemented_on_real_hardware","333364801_Experimental_investigation_of_performance_differences_between_coherent_Ising_machines_and_a_quantum_annealer","332224559_Physics-Inspired_Optimization_for_Quadratic_Unconstrained_Problems_Using_a_Digital_Annealer","332218539_PUMA_A_Programmable_Ultra-efficient_Memristor-based_Accelerator_for_Machine_Learning_Inference","334526818_Integrated_Coherent_Ising_Machines_Based_on_Self-Phase_Modulation_in_Microring_Resonators","333336444_AnalogMixed-Signal_Hardware_Error_Modeling_for_Deep_Learning_Inference","332807978_Low-Conductance_and_Multilevel_CMOS-Integrated_Nanoscale_Oxide_Memristors","330717396_A_new_golden_age_for_computer_architecture","330589871_Hardware_Acceleration_of_Simulated_Annealing_of_Spin_Glass_by_RRAM_Crossbar_Array","328888027_Memristor_crossbar_arrays_with_6-nm_half-pitch_and_2-nm_critical_dimension","325605113_Equivalent-accuracy_accelerated_neural-network_training_using_analogue_memory","328996565_RX-PUF_Low_Power_Dense_Reliable_and_Resilient_Physically_Unclonable_Functions_Based_on_Analog_Passive_RRAM_Crossbar_Arrays","327092846_Fault-_Tolerant_Dot-Product_Engines","325744081_In-memory_computing_with_resistive_switching_devices"]}
