{"id":"281894255_Designing_and_Evaluating_Digital_Game-Based_Learning_with_the_ARCS_Motivation_Model_Humor_and_Animation","abstract":"Multimedia teaching applications have been widely utilized in various subjects. The presentation of teaching materials with animations and games helps to stimulate the visual sense and enhance the learning motivation of learners. Successful learning, however, requires the stimulation of learning motivation that can inspire learners to achieve the desired learning objectives. This study combines the ARCS (Attention, Relevance, Confidence, Satisfaction) motivation model, and humor to design a set of multimedia applications that include teaching animations and games for sixth graders' natural science and technology course, called the Cat's Cradle Multimedia Learning System (CCMLS). The scenario stories of anthropomorphic characters introduce four units of natural science: levers, axles, pulleys and gears. Additionally, games are designed to impress learners even more. After the applications were prepared, tests for learning effectiveness, learning motivation and perceived fun associated with teaching materials were conducted with 106 students at the Qishan Elementary School in Kaohsiung. The experimental group used CCMLS, while the control group used videos of the textbook as the applications. A pre-test and post-test, ARCS Learning Motivation Questionnaire, Smileyometer and interviews were conducted with both groups. According to the statistical analysis, significance was detected in regard to learning effectiveness between the experimental group and the control group. Significance was also found in ARCS learning motivation and perceived fun of teaching materials. Moreover, there is a significant positive correlation between the perceived fun related to the teaching materials and learning motivation. The contribution of this study lies in the proposal of the digital game-based learning (DGBL) from the design perspective: to enhance students' learning motivation and use willingness regarding the teaching materials of the drama and the cartoon characters in humorous dialogues. The proper sound and light effects and examples that are close to daily life will also be taken into consideration in the design of the multimedia applications.","authors":["Lai-Chung Lee","Kuang-Chung Hao"],"meta":["April 2015International Journal of Technology and Human Interaction 11(2):80-95","DOI:10.4018/ijthi.2015040105"],"references":["270851624_A_Game-based_learning_system_for_improving_student's_learning_effectiveness_in_system_analysis_course","266213297_Kong_Building_a_Humorous_Virtual_Human_to_Enhance_Student's_Motivation_and_Performance_in_E-Learning_Environment","248607372_Exploring_secondary_school_students'_motivation_using_technologies_in_teaching_and_learning_mathematics","241889926_Empathetic_Virtual_Peers_Enhanced_Learner_Interest_and_Self-Efficacy","232530555_Cognitive_Constraints_on_Multimedia_Learning_When_Presenting_More_Material_Results_in_Less_Understanding","228948659_AC_2007-823_COMPUTER_SIMULATION_OF_LABORATORY_EXPERIMENTS_FOR_ENHANCED_LEARNING","223595686_The_effects_of_modern_mathematics_computer_games_on_mathematics_achievement_and_class_motivation","32231341_Literature_Review_in_Games_and_Learning","4369405_Humorist_Bot_Bringing_Computational_Humour_in_a_Chat-Bot_System","4265278_Building_an_Interactive_Caring_Agent_for_Students_in_Computer-based_Learning_Environments","345928505_Computer_Simulation_For_Manufacturing_Partnerships","345923359_A_Model_For_Teaching_Materials_Evaluation_Development_And_Testing_Of_Interactive_Computer_Simulations_Modules_For_Undergraduate_Education","344532915_Bridging_The_Gap_Between_Lab_And_Lecture_Using_Computer_Simulation","313596192_M_Motivational_design_of_instruction","284971556_Multimedia_learning_and_games","281411983_The_role_of_gender_and_ethnicity_in_pedagogical_agent_perception_Proceedings_of_World_Conference_on_E-Learning_in_Corporate","271627857_Changing_the_Rules_Education_for_Creative_Thinking","264628339_Singaporean_Teachers'_Perception_of_Activities_Useful_for_Fostering_Creativity","263153662_Understanding_Motivation_and_Schooling_Where_We've_Been_Where_We_Are_and_Where_We_Need_to_Go","258440415_Impact_of_an_augmented_reality_system_on_students'_motivation_for_a_visual_art_course","257171366_Building_virtual_cities_inspiring_intelligent_citizens_Digital_games_for_developing_students'_problem_solving_and_learning_motivation","255631513_Humour_in_game-based_learning","250144738_The_Effects_of_Computer_Animated_Elaboration_Strategies_and_Practice_on_Factual_and_Application_Learning_in_an_Elementary_Science_Lesson","248962929_Humour_and_Teaching_in_Higher_Education","248498154_Instructional_animation_versus_static_pictures_A_meta-analysis","247087380_The_influence_of_visual_cognitive_style_when_learning_from_instructional_animations_and_static_pictures","238115261_Online_Interactive_Multimedia_for_Engineering_Thermodynamics","234790118_Design_an_empathic_virtual_human_to_encourage_and_persuade_learners_in_e-learning_systems","234651090_The_Relationship_of_Motivational_Conditions_to_Effective_Instructional_Attributes_A_Magnitude_Scaling_Approach","232586739_A_Coherence_Effect_in_Multimedia_Learning_The_Case_for_Minimizing_Irrelevant_Sounds_in_the_Design_of_Multimedia_Instructional_Messages","230053439_The_Power_of_Feelings_Emotion_Imagination_and_the_Construction_of_Meaning_in_Adult_Learning","229908042_Animated_instructional_software_for_Mechanics_of_Materials_Implementation_and_assessment","229903397_Using_games_to_teach_statics_calculation_procedures_Application_and_assessment","227585188_The_Systematic_Process_of_Motivational_Design","225597877_Applying_the_ARCS_model_to_the_design_and_development_of_computer-based_modules_for_manufacturing_engineering_courses","223530184_Using_ubiquitous_games_in_an_English_listening_and_speaking_course_Impact_on_learning_outcomes_and_motivation","223449118_Sustaining_iterative_game_playing_processes_in_DGBL_The_relationship_between_motivational_processing_and_outcome_processing","223301305_Digital_Game-Based_Learning_in_high_school_Computer_Science_education_Impact_on_educational_effectiveness_and_student_motivation","222677251_Multiple_forms_of_dynamic_representation","222599472_Information-Seeking_Behavior_in_Generation_Y_Students_Motivation_Critical_Thinking_and_Learning_Theory","222533794_The_Promise_of_Multimedia_Learning_Using_the_Same_Instructional_Design_Methods_across_Different_Media","222436304_All_work_and_no_play_Measuring_fun_usability_and_learning_in_software_for_children","220495125_Evaluating_learners'_motivational_and_cognitive_processing_in_an_online_game-based_learning_environment","220140261_The_effect_of_simulation_games_on_the_learning_of_computational_problem_solving","4352414_Building_an_Interactive_Agent_with_Intention_to_Increase_Students'_Learning_Will"]}
