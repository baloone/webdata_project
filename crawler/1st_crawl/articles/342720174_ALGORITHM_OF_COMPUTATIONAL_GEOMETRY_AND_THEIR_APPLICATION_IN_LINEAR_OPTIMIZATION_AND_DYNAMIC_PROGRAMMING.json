As a branch of \ncomputer science is dedicated to the study of algorithms that can be expressed in terms of \ngeometry. Some of these studies the purely geometric problems, while others are obtained as \nthe corollary of examining computational geometric algorithms. Algorithms of computational \ngeometry today are applied in numerical computation, geometric modeling, computer vision, \ncomputer graphics, geodesy, dynamic computing, isothetic computational geometry, and \nparallel computing. In this research, is given the procedure for the generation of \ncryptographic keys with algorithm of simple polygon triangulation and Catalan numbers, is \nconstructed an algorithm for polygon triangulation based on the planted trivalent tree, is set \nup the minimum-weight triangulation algorithm based on matrix chain product and \nmemoization and was analyzed the application of the computational geometry in linear \noptimization. This research describes in detail, the interaction between Catalan numbers,\ntriangulation of convex polygon and one part of cryptography. The implementations are done \nin a Java environment and they are designed in the way to be efficient and easy to use.","authors":["Aybeyan Selim"],"meta":["July 2020","Thesis for: PhDAdvisor: Muzafer Saračević"],"references":["326215815_Generation_of_cryptographic_keys_with_algorithm_of_polygon_triangulation_and_Catalan_numbers","322709403_Encryption_based_on_Ballot_Stack_permutations_and_Balanced_Parentheses_using_Catalan-keys","284579357_From_Entanglement_Witness_to_Generalized_Catalan_Numbers","259753767_Object-Oriented_Analysis_and_Design_for_one_Algorithm_of_Computational_Geometry_Forward_Reverse_and_Round-Trip_Engineering","259558124_Alpha-Numeric_Notation_for_one_Data_Structure_in_Software_Engineering","256096270_Decomposition_of_Catalan_numbers_and_Convex_Polygon_Triangulations","243962953_Block_Method_for_Convex_Polygon_Triangulation","235256263_Implementation_of_the_convex_polygon_triangulation_algorithm","234783135_Optical_computational_geometry","221474907_An_Efficient_Volumetric_Method_for_Building_Closed_Triangular_Meshes_from_3-D_Image_and_Point_Data","321616407_Number_Story_From_Counting_to_Cryptography","321519657_An_Introduction_to_Catalan_Numbers","320011629_Methods_for_solving_the_polygon_triangulation_problem_and_their_implementation_PhD_thesis","318228735_Finding_optimal_triangulation_based_on_block_method","304335295_Algorithmic_aspect_of_motion_planning_A_tutorial_part_1","285511207_Handbook_of_discrete_and_computational_geometry","283741514_An_application_of_Combinatorics_in_Cryptography","277138971_Construction_and_Notation_of_Convex_Polygon_Triangulation_Based_on_Ballot_Problem","270077633_Algorithms_in_Combinatorial_Geometry","268895037_Discrete_Mathematics_with_Applications","268858051_An_Isothetic_View_of_Computational_Geometry","268712755_Catalan_Numbers_with_Applications","266941456_Dynamic_programming_Foundations_and_principles_2nd_ed","265829713_Modern_cryptography_primer_Theoretical_foundations_and_practical_applications","262400326_Blue_Noise_through_Optimal_Transport","262318530_Computing_Self-Supporting_Surfaces_by_Regular_Triangulation","262175346_Polygon_Mesh_Repairing_An_Application_Perspective","262012528_Proposal_for_applying_the_optimal_triangulation_method_in_3D_medical_image_processing_Software_solution_based_on_Java_Net_Beans_environments","262012380_JAVA_Implementation_for_Triangulation_of_Convex_Polygon_Based_on_Lukasiewicz's_Algorithm_and_Binary_Trees","261541299_An_algorithm_for_triangulating_multiple_3D_polygons","260870119_Design-Driven_Quadrangulation_of_Closed_3D_Curves","259582112_Handbook_of_Discrete_and_Computational_Geometry","258422252_Dynamic_Programming_A_Computational_Tool","256624264_Geometric_classification_of_triangulations_and_their_enumeration_in_a_convex_polygon","242631714_Polygonal_Approximations_of_a_Curve_-_Formulations_and_Algorithms","239539144_Minimal_Triangulations_of_Polygonal_Domains","239061905_New_Results_on_Data_Structures_in_Computational_Geometry","238740116_Perceptrons-An_Introduction_to_Computational_Geometry","238674197_A_combinatorial_theorem_in_plane_geometry","225221788_Efficient_triangulation_of_simple_polygons","222495662_Filling_gaps_in_the_boundary_of_a_polyhedron","222473665_Verifiable_Implementations_of_Geometric_Algorithms_Using_Finite_Precision_Arithmetic","222470977_Optimal_Shortest_Path_Queries_in_a_Simple_Polygon","221316515_Filling_Holes_in_Meshes","220984150_A_Parallel_Algorithm_for_Linear_Programming_in_Fixed_Dimension","220984017_On_Triangulating_Three-Dimensional_Polygons","220983636_Optimal_Parallel_Algorithms_for_Triangulated_Simple_Polygons","220690984_Efficient_algorithms_for_ray_shooting_and_hidden_surface_removal","220657246_A_Constant_Time_Parallel_Algorithm_for_Computing_Convex_Hulls","220617278_Linear-Time_Algorithms_for_Linear_Programming_in_R","220556218_Graph_of_triangulations_of_a_convex_polygon_and_tree_of_triangulations","220506749_Tetrahedral_Embedded_Boundary_Methods_for_Accurate_and_Flexible_Adaptive_Fluids","220453248_Triangulating_a_Simple_Polygon_in_Linear_Time","220452842_Small-Dimensional_Linear_Programming_and_Convex_Hulls_Made_Easy","220432481_Linear_Programming_in_Linear_Time_When_the_Dimension_Is_Fixed"]}
