{"id":"282181218_Algorithms_for_tensor_network_renormalization","abstract":"We discuss in detail algorithms for implementing tensor network\nrenormalization (TNR) for the study of classical statistical and quantum\nmany-body systems. Firstly, we recall established techniques for how the\npartition function of a 2D classical many-body system or the Euclidean path\nintegral of a 1D quantum system can be represented as a network of tensors,\nbefore describing how TNR can be implemented to efficiently contract the\nnetwork via a sequence of coarse-graining transformations. The efficacy of the\nTNR approach is then benchmarked for the 2D classical statistical and 1D\nquantum Ising models; in particular the ability of TNR to maintain a high level\nof accuracy over sustained coarse-graining transformations, even at a critical\npoint, is demonstrated.","authors":["Glen Evenbly"],"meta":["September 2015","DOI:10.1103/PhysRevB.95.045117","SourcearXiv"],"references":["38331126_Finitely_correlated_states_on_quantum_spin_chains","23464316_Quantum_Multiscale_Entanglement_Renormalization_Ansatz_Channels","282603307_Local_Scale_Transformations_on_the_Lattice_with_Tensor_Network_Renormalization","259044438_Algorithms_for_Entanglement_Renormalization_Boundaries_Impurities_and_Interfaces","235410045_Conformal_Field_Theory","51940129_Quantum_Criticality_with_the_Multi-scale_Entanglement_RenormalizationAnsatz","51417589_Multiscale_Entanglement_Renormalization_Ansatz_in_Two_Dimensions_Quantum_Ising_Model","26284972_Entanglement_Renormalization_in_Two_Spatial_Dimensions","23315808_Class_of_Quantum_Many-Body_States_That_Can_Be_Efficiently_Simulated","9013410_Efficient_Classical_Simulation_of_Slightly_Entangled_Quantum_Computations","5915720_Tensor_Renormalization_Group_Approach_to_Two-Dimensional_Classical_Lattice_Models","5619226_Entanglement_Renormalization"]}
