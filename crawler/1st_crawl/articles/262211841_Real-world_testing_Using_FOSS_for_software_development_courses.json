{"id":"262211841_Real-world_testing_Using_FOSS_for_software_development_courses","abstract":"We designed a self-contained learning module on testing and free and open source software (FOSS) for a junior-level software engineering course. In this three-part module, students first learned software quality assurance concepts, and then used JUnit to create unit tests for their code. After being familiar with JUnit from a user perspective, students were required to investigate a defect reported in the JUnit code. Students were required to reproduce the problem, write test cases, and outline an approach for fixing the problem. In this pilot study, we conducted pre and post surveys of students' knowledge of and interest in FOSS. In the poster, visual data will be presented summarizing the results obtained.","authors":["Evelyn Brannock","Nannette P.
