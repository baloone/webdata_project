{"id":"232580194_Consistency_of_pupils'_attributions_regarding_success_and_failure","abstract":"191 6th graders attending schools in 3 socioeconomic areas were asked to attribute to causes their success or failure on examinations administered in 3 subjects in the course of a trimester. The extent of consistency was measured between attributional patterns obtained from 2 tests in the same subject and between two tests in different subjects. Results show consistency in Ss' attributional patterns. It was found that consistency of attributional patterns was significantly greater when Ss received the same outcomes on the 2 tests (success or failure) than when different outcomes were received (success–failure or failure–success).
