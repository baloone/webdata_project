{"id":"3080371_On_plateaued_functions","abstract":"The focus of this article is on nonlinear characteristics of\ncryptographic Boolean functions. First, we introduce the notion of\nplateaued functions that have many cryptographically desirable\nproperties. Second, we establish a sequence of strengthened inequalities\non some of the most important nonlinearity criteria, including\nnonlinearity, avalanche, and correlation immunity, and prove that\ncritical cases of the inequalities coincide with characterizations of\nplateaued functions. We then proceed to prove that plateaued functions\ninclude as a proper subset all partially bent functions that were\nintroduced earlier by Claude Carlet (1993). This solves an interesting\nproblem that arises naturally from previously known results on partially\nbent functions. In addition, we construct plateaued, but not partially\nbent, functions that have many properties useful in cryptography","authors":["Yuliang Zheng","Xian-mo Zhang"],"meta":["April 2001IEEE Transactions on Information Theory 47(3):1215 - 1223","DOI:10.1109/18.915690","SourceIEEE Xplore"],"references":["285332359_Nonlinearity_Criteria_for_Cryptographic_Functions","313138117_Propagation_characteristics_of_boolean_functions","270314306_Differential_and_Integral_Calculus","266366129_The_linear_kernel_of_Boolean_functions_and_partially-bent_functions","264907410_Differential_and_integral_calculus","258239683_The_theory_of_error-correcting_codes_Parts_I_II","256391988_On_bent_functions","248755729_Nonlinearity_Criteria_for_Cryptographic_Application","243452325_Another_NP-complete_partition_problem_and_the_complexity_of_computing_short_vectors_in_a_lattice","242372965_Turing_machines_that_take_advice"]}
