{"id":"288883999_Programming_by_rehearsal","abstract":"Programming by Rehearsal is a visual programming environment that nonprogrammers can use to create educational software. It combines many of the qualities of computer-based design environments with the full power of a programming language. The emphasis in this graphical environment is on programming visually; only things that can be seen can be manipulated. The design and programming process consists of moving performers around on stages and teaching them how to interact by sending cues to one another. The system relies almost completely on interactive graphics and allows designers to react immediately to their emerging products by showing them, at all stages of development, exactly what their potential users will see.","authors":["William Finzer","Laura Gould"],"meta":["January 1984Byte 9(6):187-210"],"references":[]}
