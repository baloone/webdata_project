{"id":"242680143_A_SIMPLE_PRIME-GENERATING_RECURRENCE","abstract":"We provide a proof of the conjecture that the sequence of first differences of the solution to f(n) = f(n 1)+ gcd(n, f(n 1)) with f(1) = 7 consists only of 1s and primes. The limiting behavior of f(n)/n is also studied.","authors":["Eric Rowland"],"meta":["January 2008"],"references":["239064151_Diophantine_Representation_of_the_Set_of_Prime_Numbers","324634228_History_of_a_Formula_for_Primes","267088668_Diophantine_representation_of_the_set_of_prime_numbers","243070730_A_prime-representing_function","2145297_A_New_Kind_of_Science"]}
