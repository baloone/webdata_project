{"id":"342701816_Software_Engineering_for_Smart_Healthcare","abstract":"Software engineering has been used by software vendors and consultants in the development of quality health care applications ranging from electronic medical systems, patient record management applications to medical middleware devices. As a discipline, it has evolved over the last decade in the production of high-quality software across many industries. Healthcare applications demand unique expertise tailored to best project methodologies and software development models. Many health care providers argue that best software practices and user-centered design principles are vital to producing quality applications across all domains. Lack of focus on systematic software development process increases flaws in the implementation causing a loss regarding quality, cost, and trust. The survey paper seeks to analyze existing models in the area of Software Engineering and to propose best SDLC model for Smart Healthcare applications which focuses on quality improvement. This survey also includes identifying the research challenges of software engineering for smart applications.","authors":["Neelu Lalband","Kavitha Dwaram"],"meta":["April 2019","DOI:10.35940/ijitee.F1066.0486S419"],"references":["268334807_Software_Development_Life_Cycle_AGILE_vs_Traditional_Approaches","257391085_The_situational_factors_that_affect_the_software_development_process_Towards_a_comprehensive_reference_framework","221307555_Maintenance_and_Agile_Development_Challenges_Opportunities_and_Future_Directions","45630640_Security_and_Privacy_Issues_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_for_Healthcare_Applications","31978101_Rapid_application_development_RAD_An_empirical_review","5176165_Beyond_the_waterfall_software_development_at_Microsoft","319947537_Sixty_Years_of_Software_Development_Life_Cycle_Models","261309880_Software_engineering_in_health_care_Is_it_really_different_And_how_to_gain_impact","261230880_The_Maturation_of_Agile_Software_Development_Principles_and_Practice_Observations_on_Successive_Industrial_Studies_in_2010_and_2012","261047172_A_Comparative_Analysis_of_Traditional_Software_Engineering_and_Agile_Software_Development","222568482_A_comparison_of_issues_and_advantages_in_agile_and_incremental_development_between_state_of_the_art_and_an_industrial_case","220691727_An_Integrated_Approach_to_Software_Engineering","220425193_Challenges_of_Migrating_to_Agile_Methodologies","2955570_Get_Ready_for_Agile_Methods_With_Care"]}
