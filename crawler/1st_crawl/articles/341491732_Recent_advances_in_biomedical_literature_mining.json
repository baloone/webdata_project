{"id":"341491732_Recent_advances_in_biomedical_literature_mining","abstract":"The recent years have witnessed a rapid increase in the number of scientific articles in biomedical domain. These literature are mostly available and readily accessible in electronic format. The domain knowledge hidden in them is critical for biomedical research and applications, which makes biomedical literature mining (BLM) techniques highly demanding. Numerous efforts have been made on this topic from both biomedical informatics (BMI) and computer science (CS) communities. The BMI community focuses more on the concrete application problems and thus prefer more interpretable and descriptive methods, while the CS community chases more on superior performance and generalization ability, thus more sophisticated and universal models are developed. The goal of this paper is to provide a review of the recent advances in BLM from both communities and inspire new research directions.","authors":["Sendong Zhao","Chang Su","Zhiyong Lu","Fei Wang"],"meta":["May 2020Briefings in Bioinformatics 22(7798)","DOI:10.1093/bib/bbaa057"],"references":["340465072_Structured_Multi-Label_Biomedical_Text_Tagging_via_Attentive_Neural_Tree_Decoding","340002962_Hydroxychloroquine_a_less_toxic_derivative_of_chloroquine_is_effective_in_inhibiting_SARS-CoV-2_infection_in_vitro","338425292_Bi-directional_differentiation_of_single_bronchioalveolar_stem_cells_during_lung_repair","337023168_Deep_learning_for_drug-drug_interaction_extraction_from_the_literature_a_review","336663090_A_Deep_Learning_Approach_With_Deep_Contextualized_Word_Representations_for_Chemical-Protein_Interaction_Extraction_From_Biomedical_Literature","339821049_Keep_up_with_the_latest_coronavirus_research","339778513_Remdesivir_as_a_possible_therapeutic_option_for_the_COVID-19","337989061_Should_Health_Care_Demand_Interpretable_Artificial_Intelligence_or_Accept_Black_Box_Medicine","337881145_A_Systematic_Review_on_Literature-based_Discovery_General_Overview_Methodology_Statistical_Analysis","336406558_FullMeSH_Improving_large-scale_MeSH_indexing_with_full_text"]}
