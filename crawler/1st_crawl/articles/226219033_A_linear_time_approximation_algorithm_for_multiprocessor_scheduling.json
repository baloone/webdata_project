{"id":"226219033_A_linear_time_approximation_algorithm_for_multiprocessor_scheduling","abstract":"Givenn jobs andm identical processors anO(n) approximation algorithm is presented which tries to determine a nonpreemptive schedule with minimum finish time. Ifr is the number of jobs placed onto the processor with maximum finish time, then the worst case ratio of the new algorithm's finish time to the optimal solution is shown to be less thanrm/(rmâ€“m+1). Extensive empirical results show that the new algorithm is competitive with the LPT algorithm in terms of quality of solution and faster in terms of computing time.","authors":["Greg Finn","Ellis Horowitz"],"meta":["September 1979BIT.
