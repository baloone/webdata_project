{"id":"300885399_Mutation_Testing_Process_Combined_with_Test-Driven_Development_in_NET_Environment","abstract":"In test-driven development, basic tests are prepared for a piece of program before its coding. Many short development cycles are repeated within the process, requiring a quick response of the prepared tests and the tested code extract. Mutation testing, used for evaluation and development of test cases, usually takes a considerable time to obtain a valuable test assessment. We discuss combination of these techniques in one development process. The presented ideas are implemented in VisualMutator â€“ an extension of Visual Studio. The tool supports selected standard and object-oriented mutations of C# programs. Mutations are introduced at the level of the Common Intermediate Language of .NET. A program or its selected methods can be mutated in a batch process or during interactive sessions.","authors":["Anna Derezinska","Piotr Trzpil"],"meta":["January 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-19216-1_13","In book: Theory and Engineering of Complex Systems and Dependability (pp.131-140)","Project: VisualMutator - Visual Studio mutation testing tool"],"references":["317415043_Muta-Pro_towards_the_definition_of_a_mutation_testing_process","236893390_Quality_of_Testing_in_Test_Driven_Development","224247676_Object-Oriented_Mutation_Applied_in_Common_Intermediate_Language_Programs_Originated_from_C","224247675_An_Analysis_of_OO_Mutation_Operators","224115987_Judy_-_A_mutation_testing_tool_for_Java","220069671_An_Analysis_and_Survey_of_the_Development_of_Mutation_Testing","3556868_An_Experimental_Evaluation_of_Selective_Mutation","283677521_Improving_Mutation_Testing_Process_of_Python_Programs","264859377_Testing_Object-Oriented_Code_Through_a_Specifications-Based_Mutation_Engine","262673571_CREAM_a_system_for_object-oriented_mutation_of_C_programs","262673569_Mutation_testing_of_ASPNET_MVC_Chapter_9","262352212_Quality_Evaluation_of_Object-Oriented_and_Standard_Mutation_Operators_Applied_to_C_Programs","257012131_Mutation_at_the_multi-class_and_system_levels","240106325_Manifesto_for_Agile_Software_Development","234793973_XUnit_Test_Patterns_Refactoring_Test_Code","224236216_Agile_planning_and_development_methods","224132836_Mutation_Testing_Cost_Reduction_Techniques_A_Survey","220691599_Introduction_to_Software_Testing","220516324_MuJava_An_automated_class_mutation_system","216027190_Test-Driven_Development-By_Example","213877944_Test_Driven_Development_By_Example"]}
