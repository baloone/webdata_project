In order to compare and examine research outputs, the study period was divided into two time-periods. The first period included articles published between 2008 and 2013 and the second period included articles published between 2014 and 2019.\nSeveral analyses are presented in the scope of scientometrics regarding the (a) countries (b) historical occurrence-time (c) institutions (d) author collaboration (e) study topics-keywords (f) journals. This paper provides meta-analysis in different areas. We believe that our analysis results will shed a light for each area as well as interaction and intersection between both areas. As IS discipline and researchers we need to understand these intersections and interactions as well as understanding current trends in both disciplines.\n\nKEYWORDS\nComputer Science, Information Systems, WoS Publications, Macro Level Profiles, Scientometrics","authors":["Erman Coskun","Guzin Ozdagoglu","Muhammet Damar","Busra Alma"],"meta":["April 2019","DOI:10.33965/is2019_201905L023","Conference: 12th IADIS International Conference Information Systems 2019"],"references":["318940072_Are_Scientometrics_Informetrics_and_Bibliometrics_different","298717827_Big_Data_Research_in_Information_Systems_Toward_an_Inclusive_Research_Agenda","227316155_The_Literature_of_Bibliometrics_Scientometrics_and_Informetrics","220591222_Research_in_Information_Systems_An_Empirical_Study_of_Diversity_in_the_Discipline_and_Its_Journals","290128428_Management_Information_Systems_Research_What's_There_in_a_Methodology","265295703_Synthesizing_Information_Systems_Knowledge_A_Typology_of_Literature_Reviews","227618479_The_State_and_Evolution_of_Information_Systems_Research_in_Canada_A_Scientometric_Analysis","227447617_The_Evolution_of_Research_on_Information_Systems_A_Fiftieth-Year_Survey_of_the_Literature_in_Management_Science","220662793_Management_Information_Systems_Evolution_and_Status","220653238_Analysis_of_keyword_networks_in_MIS_research_and_implications_for_predicting_knowledge_evolution"]}
