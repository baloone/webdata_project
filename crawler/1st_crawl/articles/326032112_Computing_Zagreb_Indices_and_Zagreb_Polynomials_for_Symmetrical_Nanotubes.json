{"id":"326032112_Computing_Zagreb_Indices_and_Zagreb_Polynomials_for_Symmetrical_Nanotubes","abstract":"Topological indices are numbers related to sub-atomic graphs to allow quantitative\nstructure-movement/property/danger connections. These topological indices correspond to some specific physico-concoction properties such as breaking point, security, strain vitality of chemical compounds. The idea of topological indices were set up in compound graph hypothesis in view of vertex degrees. These indices are valuable in the investigation of mitigating exercises of specific Nanotubes and compound systems. In this paper, we discuss Zagreb types of indices and Zagreb polynomials for a few Nanotubes covered by cycles.","authors":["Zehui Shao","Muhammad Kamran Siddiqui","Mehwish Hussain Muhammad"],"meta":["June 2018Symmetry 10(7)","DOI:10.3390/sym10070244"],"references":["325266098_On_Topological_Properties_of_Symmetric_Chemical_Structures","324853965_On_the_Maximum_ABC_Index_of_Graphs_With_Prescribed_Size_and_Without_Pendent_Vertices","319600362_Topological_Characterization_of_Carbon_Graphite_and_Crystal_Cubic_Carbon_Structures","317290642_On_leap_Zagreb_indices_of_graphs","312324384_On_the_First_and_Second_Zagreb_and_First_and_Second_Hyper-Zagreb_Indices_of_Carbon_Nanocones_CNCkn_184","309429188_Computing_topological_indices_of_certain_networks","308975412_The_Redefined_First_Second_and_Third_Zagreb_Indices_of_Titania_Nanotubes_206","319123037_On_the_maximum_ABC_index_of_graphs_without_pendent_vertices","316665321_On_Zagreb_Indices_Zagreb_Polynomials_of_Mesh_Derived_Networks","313603847_Some_properties_of_the_second_Zagreb_index"]}
