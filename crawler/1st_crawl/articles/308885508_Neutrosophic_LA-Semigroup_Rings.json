{"id":"308885508_Neutrosophic_LA-Semigroup_Rings","abstract":"Neutrosophic LA-semigroup is a midway structure between a neutrosophic groupoid and a commutative neutrosophic semigroup. Rings are the old concept in algebraic structures. We combine the neutrosophic LA-semigroup and ring together to form the notion of neutrosophic LA-semigroup ring. Neutrosophic LAsemigroup ring is defined analogously to neutrosophic group ring and neutrosophic semigroup ring.","authors":["Mumtaz Ali","Muhammad Shabir","Florentin Smarandache","Luige Vladareanu"],"meta":["January 2015","DOI:10.5281/zenodo.30219","Project: New Trends in Neutrosophic Theory and Applications"],"references":[]}
