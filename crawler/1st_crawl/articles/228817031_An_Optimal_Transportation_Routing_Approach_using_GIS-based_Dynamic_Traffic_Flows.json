{"id":"228817031_An_Optimal_Transportation_Routing_Approach_using_GIS-based_Dynamic_Traffic_Flows","abstract":"This paper examines the value of real-time traffic information gathered through Geographic Information Systems for achieving an optimal vehicle routing within a dynamically stochastic transportation network. We present a systematic approach in determining the dynamically varying parameters and implementation attributes that were used for the development of a Web-based transportation routing application integrated with real-time GIS services. We propose and implement an optimal routing algorithm by modifying Dijkstra's algorithm in order to incorporate stochastically changing traffic flows. We describe the significant features of our Web application in making use of the real-time dynamic traffic flow information from GIS services towards achieving total costs savings and vehicle usage reduction. These features help users and vehicle drivers in improving their service levels and productivity as the Web application enables them to interactively find the optimal path and in identifying destinations effectively.","authors":["Ammar Alazab","Sitalakshmi Venkatraman","Jemal Abawajy","Mamoun Alazab"],"meta":[],"references":["238836689_Dynamic_Shortest_Paths_in_Acyclic_Networks_with_Markovian_Arc_Costs","229448999_A_Computational_Study_of_Alternative_Algorithms_and_Labeling_Techniques_for_Finding_Shortest_Path_Trees","228738263_Stochastic_motion_planning_and_applications_to_traffic","266702368_Applied_Probability_and_Stochastic_Processes","244970222_A_note_on_two_problems_in_connexion_with_graphs_Numerische_Mathematik","226603018_Time-Dependent_Route_Planning","225987351_Shortest_Paths_Algorithms_Theory_and_Experimental_Evaluation","223434492_An_extension_of_labeling_techniques_for_finding_shortest_path_trees","223382138_Multicriteria_adaptive_paths_in_stochastic_time-varying_networks","222554735_Shortest_paths_in_stochastic_networks_with_correlated_link_costs"]}
