{"id":"312912515_Nonrepetitive_colorings_of_graphs_excluding_a_fixed_immersion_or_topological_minor","abstract":"We prove that graphs excluding a fixed immersion have bounded nonrepetitive chromatic number. More generally, we prove that if $H$ is a fixed planar graph that has a planar embedding with all the vertices with degree at least 4 on a single face, then graphs excluding $H$ as a topological minor have bounded nonrepetitive chromatic number. This is the largest class of graphs known to have bounded nonrepetitive chromatic number.","authors":["Paul Wollan","David R.
