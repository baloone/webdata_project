{"id":"301945975_Data_Security_Privacy_Availability_and_Integrity_in_Cloud_Computing_Issues_and_Current_Solutions","abstract":"Cloud computing changed the world around us. Now people are moving their data to the cloud since data is getting bigger and needs to be accessible from many devices. Therefore, storing the data on the cloud becomes a norm. However, there are many issues that counter data stored in the cloud starting from virtual machine which is the mean to share resources in cloud and ending on cloud storage itself issues. In this paper, we present those issues that are preventing people from adopting the cloud and give a survey on solutions that have been done to minimize risks of these issues. For example, the data stored in the cloud needs to be confidential, preserving integrity and available. Moreover, sharing the data stored in the cloud among many users is still an issue since the cloud service provider is untrustworthy to manage authentication and authorization. In this paper, we list issues related to data stored in cloud storage and solutions to those issues which differ from other papers which focus on cloud as general.","authors":["Sultan Aldossary","William Allen"],"meta":["April 2016International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications 7(4)","DOI:10.14569/IJACSA.2016.070464"],"references":["309618359_Enhancing_Data_Security_in_Cloud_Computing_Using_a_Lightweight_Cryptographic_Algorithm","314917527_A_Light-Weight_Permutation_Based_Method_for_Data_Privacy_in_Mobile_Cloud_Computing","313241940_An_efficient_and_secure_dynamic_auditing_protocol_for_data_storage_in_cloud_computing","312383457_A_quantitative_analysis_of_current_security_concerns_and_solutions_for_cloud_computing","311766311_A_Key_Aggregate_Framework_with_Adaptable_Offering_of_Information_in_Cloud","311344281_A_survey_on_security_issues_in_service_delivery_models_of_cloud_computing","308867572_Privacy_preservation_and_public_auditing_for_cloud_data_using_ASS_in_Multi-cloud","308840161_A_secure_authentication_scheme_for_MobiCloud","307632417_Identity_Based_Cryptosystems_and_Signature_Scheme_In_G_R_Blakley_and_David_Chaum_Eds","306353318_Security_guidance_for_critical_areas_of_focus_in_cloud_computing_v21"]}
