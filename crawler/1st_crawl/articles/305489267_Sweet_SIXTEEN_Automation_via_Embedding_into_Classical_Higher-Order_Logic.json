{"id":"305489267_Sweet_SIXTEEN_Automation_via_Embedding_into_Classical_Higher-Order_Logic","abstract":"An embedding of many-valued logics based on SIXTEEN in classical higher-order logic is presented. SIXTEEN generalizes the four-valued set of truth degrees of Dunn/Belnap’s system to a lattice of sixteen truth degrees with multiple distinct ordering relations between them. The the- oretical motivation is to demonstrate that many-valued logics, like other non-classical logics, can be elegantly modeled (and even combined) as frag- ments of classical higher-order logic. Equally relevant are the pragmatic aspects of the presented approach: interactive and automated reasoning in many-valued logics, which have broad applications in computer sci- ence, artificial intelligence, linguistics, philosophy and mathematics, be- come readily enabled with state of the art reasoning tools for classical higher-order logic.","authors":["Alexander Steen","Christoph Benzmüller"],"meta":["December 2016Logic and Logical Philosophy 25(4)","DOI:10.12775/LLP.2016.021","Project: LEO-III"],"references":["304919080_Agent-Based_HOL_Reasoning","304919077_Automating_Free_Logic_in_IsabelleHOL","281677232_Higher-Order_Modal_Logics_Automation_and_Applications","281677229_Invited_Talk_On_a_Quite_Universal_Theorem_Proving_Approach_and_Its_Application_in_Metaphysics","280986731_The_Higher-Order_Prover_Leo-II","280932541_Embedding_of_First-Order_Nominal_Logic_into_Higher-Order_Logic","273201458_Interacting_with_Modal_Logics_in_the_Coq_Proof_Assistant","271584989_COMPUTER-ASSISTED_ANALYSIS_OF_THE_ANDERSON-HAJEK_ONTOLOGICAL_CONTROVERSY","319394234_Automated_Deduction_in_Multiple-Valued_Logics","291768720_A_useful_four-valued_logic"]}
