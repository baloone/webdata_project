{"id":"301920721_Three-way_cognitive_concept_learning_via_multi-granularity","abstract":"The key strategy of the three-way decisions theory is to consider a decision-making problem as a ternary classification one (i.e. acceptance, rejection and non-commitment). Recently, this theory has been introduced into formal concept analysis for mining three-way concepts to support three-way decisions in formal contexts. That is, the three-way decisions have been performed by incorporating the idea of ternary classification into the design of extension or intension of a concept. However, the existing methods on the studies of three-way concepts are constructive, which means that the three-way concepts had been formed by defining certain concept-forming operators in advance. In order to reveal the essential characteristics of three-way concepts in making decisions from the perspective of cognition, it is necessary to reconsider three-way concepts under the framework of general concept-forming operators. In other words, axiomatic approaches are required to characterize three-way concepts. Motivated by this problem, this study mainly focuses on three-way concept learning via multi-granularity from the viewpoint of cognition. Specifically, we firstly put forward an axiomatic approach to describe three-way concepts by means of multi-granularity. Then, we design a three-way cognitive computing system to find composite three-way cognitive concepts. Furthermore, we use the idea of set approximation to simulate cognitive processes for learning three-way cognitive concepts from a given clue. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed learning methods.","authors":["Jinhai Li","Chenchen Huang","Jianjun Qi","Yuhua Qian"],"meta":["February 2017Information Sciences 378(1):244-263","DOI:10.1016/j.ins.2016.04.051","Project: Granular computing based concept learning from the cognitive viewpoint"],"references":["291669375_Granular_Computing_Approach_to_Two_way_Learning_Based_on_Formal_Concept_Analysis_in_Fuzzy_Datasets","285747255_Advances_in_three-way_decisions_and_granular_computing","283414581_Three-Way_Formal_Concept_Analysis","283033930_Three-way_Investment_Decisions_with_Decision-theoretic_Rough_Sets","280447044_A_local_approach_to_rule_induction_in_multi-scale_decision_tables","280446797_Cognitive_concept_learning_via_granular_computing_for_big_data","270091292_On_Cognitive_Computing","268440623_An_Outline_of_a_Theory_of_Three-Way_Decisions","267729853_Granular_Computing_Approach_to_Two-Way_Learning_Based_on_Formal_Concept_Analysis_in_Fuzzy_Datasets","327207743_Granular_Computing_Analysis_and_Design_of_Intelligent_Systems","307904688_Shipment_policy_optimisation_in_a_return_supply_chain_for_online_retailers_via_stochastic_discrete_event_simulation","289516799_Granular_Computing_and_Sequential_Three-Way_Decisions","285751961_Three-Way_Decisions_Solution_to_Filter_Spam_Email_An_Empirical_Study","285600235_Green_Computing_and_Cognitive_Computing","285277704_Ordered_sets_chap_restructuring_lattice_theory","282968140_The_connections_between_three-way_and_classical_concept_lattices","282557206_Ranking_interval_sets_based_on_inclusion_measures_and_applications_to_three-way_decisions","282492351_Three-way_recommender_systems_based_on_random_forests","281382234_Rough_set_models_in_multigranulation_spaces","281182584_Sequential_three-way_decision_and_granulation_for_cost-sensitive_face_recognition","280446975_A_comparative_study_of_multigranulation_rough_sets_and_concept_lattices_via_rule_acquisition","279211258_A_tree-based_incremental_overlapping_clustering_method_using_the_three-way_decision_theory","278716461_Test_cost_sensitive_multigranulation_rough_set_Model_and_minimal_cost_selection","276151247_Formal_concept_analysis_approach_to_cognitive_functionalities_of_bidirectional_associative_memory","273651205_Intuitionistic_fuzzy_multigranulation_rough_sets","273390150_Systematic_mapping_study_on_granular_computing","270391624_Deriving_three-way_decisions_from_intuitionistic_fuzzy_decision-theoretic_rough_sets","269693567_Concept_learning_via_granular_computing_A_cognitive_viewpoint","269182341_EXCELS_study_results_do_not_rule_out_potential_cancer_risk_with_omalizumab","269181424_Granular_Transformation_and_Irreducible_Element_Judgment_Theory_Based_on_Pictorial_Diagrams","268188464_Computational_Intelligence_and_Information_Management_Allocation_of_information_granularity_in_optimization_and_decision-making_models_Towards_building_the_foundations_of_Granular_Computing","267149159_Cognitive_MODEL_based_on_granular_computing","266398094_On_the_union_and_intersection_operations_of_rough_sets_based_on_various_approximation_spaces","264542261_Decision-theoretic_three-way_approximations_of_fuzzy_sets","263092405_Three-way_decisions_space_and_three-way_decisions","262491133_Generic_normal_cloud_model","262219401_Modelling_Multi-agent_Three-way_Decisions_with_Decision-theoretic_Rough_Sets","261959441_Pessimistic_rough_set_based_decisions_A_multigranulation_fusion_strategy","260622246_On_Robust_Fuzzy_Rough_Set_Models","260250816_Novel_cognitive_system_model_and_approach_to_transformation_of_information_granules","260010989_On_multi-granulation_covering_rough_sets","257391727_On_the_structure_of_the_multigranulation_rough_set_model","257313308_Relating_attribute_reduction_in_formal_object-oriented_and_property-oriented_concept_lattices","257272271_An_efficient_rough_feature_selection_algorithm_with_a_multi-granulation_view","257272174_Incomplete_decision_contexts_Approximate_concept_construction_rule_acquisition_and_knowledge_reduction_International","257272099_Optimal_scale_selection_for_multi-scale_decision_tables","257272086_Axiomatic_characterizations_of_dual_concept_lattices","257271979_NMGRS_Neighborhood-based_multigranulation_rough_sets","256212231_Rough_set","242629344_Fuzzy_set_and_information_granularity","241637992_A_Novel_Algorithm_for_Finding_Reducts_With_Fuzzy_Rough_Sets","237132799_Restructuring_lattice_theory_an_approach_based_on_lattices_of_concepts","236162014_Three-way_Investment_Decisions_with_Decisiontheoretic_Rough_Sets","228964516_Concept_approximations_based_on_rough_sets_and_similarity_measures","225701437_A_mathematical_model_for_concept_granular_computing_systems"]}
