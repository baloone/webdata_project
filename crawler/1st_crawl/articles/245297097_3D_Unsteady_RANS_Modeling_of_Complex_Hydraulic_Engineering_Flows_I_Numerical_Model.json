{"id":"245297097_3D_Unsteady_RANS_Modeling_of_Complex_Hydraulic_Engineering_Flows_I_Numerical_Model","abstract":"A general-purpose numerical method is developed for solving the full three-dimensional (3D), incompressible, unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) equations in natural river reaches containing complex hydraulic structures at full-scale Reynolds numbers. The method adopts body-fitted, chimera overset grids in conjunction with a grid-embedding strategy to accurately and efficiently discretize arbitrarily complex, multiconnected flow domains. The URANS and turbulence closure equations are discretized using a second-order accurate finite-volume approach. The discrete equations are integrated in time via a dual-time-stepping, artificial compressibility method in conjunction with an efficient coupled, block-implicit, approximate factorization iterative solver. The computer code is parallelized to take full advantage of multiprocessor computer systems so that unsteady solutions on grids with 10(6) nodes can be obtained within reasonable computational time. The power of the method is demonstrated by applying it to simulate turbulent flow at R similar or equal to 10(7) in a stretch of the Chattahoochee River containing a portion of the actual bridge foundation located near Cornelia, Georgia. It is shown that the method can capture the onset of coherent vortex shedding in the vicinity of the foundation while accounting for the large-scale topographical features of the surrounding river reach.","authors":["Lijuan Ge","Fotis Sotiropoulos"],"meta":["September 2005Journal of Hydraulic Engineering 131(9)","DOI:10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9429(2005)131:9(800)"],"references":["255672270_Three-Dimensional_Numerical_Model_of_Lateral-Intake_Inflows","228958634_Coherent_Structures_in_Flat-Bed_Abutment_Flow_Computational_Fluid_Dynamics_Simulations_and_Experiments","284789736_Uber_einige_Abbildungsaufgaben","275188399_3D_Numerical_Modeling_of_Flow_and_Sediment_Transport_in_Open_Channels","273093475_Numerical_Model_for_Simulation_of_Pump-Intake_Flow_and_Vortices","255601252_Role_of_Turbulence_Model_in_Prediction_of_Pump-Bay_Vortices","245356473_Assessment_of_Artificial_Dissipation_Models_for_Three-Dimensional_Incompressible_Flow_Solutions","245297030_Three-Dimensional_CFD_Modeling_of_Self-Forming_Meandering_Channel","245297001_Nonhydrostatic_Three-Dimensional_Method_for_Hydraulic_Flow_Simulation_II_Validation_and_Application","245296559_Pier_and_Abutment_Scour_-_An_Integrated_Approach","239395415_Three-dimensional_numerical_model_for_open_channel_with_free_surface_variations","239389341_Nonhydrostatic_Three-Dimensional_Model_for_Hydraulic_Flow_Simulation_I_Formulation_and_Verification","237899415_Three-Dimensional_Simulation_of_Scour-Inducing_Flow_at_Bridge_Piers","234268854_Momentum_Transfer_in_Boundary_Layer","227568653_Introduction_to_Statistical_Turbulence_Modelling_for_Hydraulic_Engineering_Flows","222704990_Strategies_for_turbulence_modelling_and_simulations","222658473_An_overset-grid_method_for_3D_unsteady_incompressible_flows","222460037_An_Implicit_Finite-Difference_Algorithm_for_Hyperbolic_Systems_in_Conservation_Law_Form","24386215_On_the_use_of_composite_grid_schemes_in_computational_aerodynamics"]}
