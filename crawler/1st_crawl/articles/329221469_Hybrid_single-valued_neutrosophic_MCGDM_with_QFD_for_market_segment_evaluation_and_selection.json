{"id":"329221469_Hybrid_single-valued_neutrosophic_MCGDM_with_QFD_for_market_segment_evaluation_and_selection","abstract":"Market segment evaluation and selection (MSE/MSS) become one of the most essential elements in marketing practices of enterprises, since they assist enterprises in developing homogeneous market segments. In this paper, a hybrid single-valued neutrosophic multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) approach with quality function deployment (QFD) is used to support the MSE/MSS process. Firstly, single-valued neutrosophic numbers are used to represent the decision-makers' qualitative assessments. Secondly, an extended QFD is used to translate the customer requirements (CRs) into relevant design requirements (DRs), and a single-valued neutrosophic DEMATEL (DEcision-MAking Trial and Evaluation Laboratory) is used to determine the importance weights of CRs and DRs. Thirdly, a single-valued neutrosophic TODIM (An acronym in Portuguese of interactive and multi-criteria decision-making) is employed to rank all the alternatives. Subsequently, a case study of MSE/MSS of a smart bike-sharing company is presented. Finally, some valuable managerial suggestions are provided through the results of sensitivity analysis and comparative analysis.","authors":["Zhang-peng Tian","Jianqiang Wang","Hong-Yu
