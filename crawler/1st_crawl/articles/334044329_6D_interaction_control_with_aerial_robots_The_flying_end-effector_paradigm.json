{"id":"334044329_6D_interaction_control_with_aerial_robots_The_flying_end-effector_paradigm","abstract":"This paper presents a novel paradigm for physical interactive tasks in aerial robotics allowing reliability to be increased and weight and costs to be reduced compared with state-of-the-art approaches. By exploiting its tilted propeller actuation, the robot is able to control the full 6D pose (position and orientation independently) and to exert a full-wrench (force and torque independently) with a rigidly attached end-effector. Interaction is achieved by means of an admittance control scheme in which an outer loop control governs the desired admittance behavior (i.e., interaction compliance/stiffness, damping, and mass) and an inner loop based on inverse dynamics ensures full 6D pose tracking. The interaction forces are estimated by an inertial measurement unit (IMU)-enhanced momentum-based observer. An extensive experimental campaign is performed and four case studies are reported: a hard touch and slide on a wooden surface, called the sliding surface task; a tilted peg-in-hole task, i.e., the insertion of the end-effector in a tilted funnel; an admittance shaping experiment in which it is shown how the stiffness, damping, and apparent mass can be modulated at will; and, finally, the fourth experiment is to show the effectiveness of the approach also in the presence of time-varying interaction forces.","authors":["Markus Ryll","Giuseppe Muscio","Francesco Pierri","Elisabetta Cataldi"],"meta":["June 2019The International Journal of Robotics Research 38(8):027836491985669","DOI:10.1177/0278364919856694"],"references":["323058771_Aerial_Co-Manipulation_With_Cables_The_Role_of_Internal_Force_for_Equilibria_Stability_and_Passivity","321233542_Differential_Flatness_of_Quadrotor_Dynamics_Subject_to_Rotor_Drag_for_Accurate_Tracking_of_High-Speed_Trajectories","320496253_Nonlinear_feedback_control_of_Quadrotors_exploiting_First-Order_Drag_Effects","318693969_Adaptive_closed-loop_speed_control_of_BLDC_motors_with_applications_to_multi-rotor_aerial_vehicles","318693968_6D_physical_interaction_with_a_fully_actuated_aerial_robot","318688602_Control_of_statically_hoverable_multi-rotor_aerial_vehicles_and_application_to_rotor-failure_robustness_for_hexarotors","325369967_Robotics_Modelling_planning_and_control","323198649_Full-Pose_Tracking_Control_for_Aerial_Robotic_Systems_With_Laterally_Bounded_Input_Force","320250619_External_Wrench_Estimation_Collision_Detection_and_Reflex_Reaction_for_Flying_Robots","318036804_Coordinated_Control_of_Aerial_Robotic_Manipulators_Theory_and_Experiments","316786071_Dynamic_Decentralized_Control_for_Protocentric_Aerial_Manipulators","311755244_Modeling_and_control_of_FAST-Hex_A_fully-actuated_by_synchronized-tilting_hexarotor","317060191_Design_and_implementation_of_a_novel_architecture_for_physical_human-UAV_interaction","312169752_A_Unified_Framework_for_External_Wrench_Estimation_Interaction_Control_and_Collision_Reflexes_for_Flying_Robots","311755084_Design_modeling_and_control_of_omni-directional_aerial_robot"]}
