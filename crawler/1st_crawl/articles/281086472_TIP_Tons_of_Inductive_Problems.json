{"id":"281086472_TIP_Tons_of_Inductive_Problems","abstract":"This paper describes our collection of benchmarks for inductive theorem provers. The recent spur of interest in automated inductive theorem proving has increased the demands for evaluation and comparison between systems. We expect the benchmark suite to continually grow as more problems are submitted by the community. New challenge problems will promote further development of provers which will greatly benefit both developers and users of inductive theorem provers.","authors":["Koen Claessen","Moa Johansson","Dan Ros√©n","Nicholas Smallbone"],"meta":["July 2015","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-20615-8_23","Conference: Conference on Intelligent Computer Mathematics"],"references":["262996008_Hipster_Integrating_Theory_Exploration_in_a_Proof_Assistant","262349546_Automating_Inductive_Proofs_Using_Theory_Exploration","262272311_Hipster_Integrating_Theory_Exploration_in_a_Proof_Assistant","262211622_Zeno_An_Automated_Prover_for_Properties_of_Recursive_Data_Structures","251696895_IsaPlanner_2_A_Proof_Planner_for_Isabelle","312747009_Induction_for_SMT_Solvers","282690967_Productive_use_of_failure_in_inductive_proof","246571097_J_MOORE_Computer-Aided_Reasoning_An_Approach","242608816_Acl2_computer_aided_reasoning_an_approach_vol_1","230625832_Computer-Aided_Reasoning_An_Approach"]}
