{"id":"3344345_Parallel_interactive_visualization_of_3D_mantle_convection","abstract":"In 3D simulation of thermal convective flows that change with\ntime, each run can generate gigabytes of data. A client server\nvisualization tool called pV3, running on a parallel computer, allows\ndata exploration during computation instead of by postprocessing. While\npV3 has been primarily used in the area of flow visualization designed\nwith aerospace applications in mind, it has easily been applied in other\nflow visualization areas, such as geoscience. It has also been used for\n3D wave propagation problems, including seismic waves and\nelectromagnetics. More importantly, many of the concepts of pV3's client\nserver interactive parallel visualization model could be used as a\nprototype for other application areas, such as enhanced MRI in medicine.\nThe key to this kind of interactive visualization lies in being able to\nscale the compute part of the visualization as well as the application\nis scaled, while still minimizing network traffic. The article discusses\nthe use of pV3 for investigating thermal convection in the interior of\nthe Earth. pV3 was used to help understand details of the physics of\nvariable viscosity and phase transitions in high Rayleigh number\nconvection","authors":["Kirk E.
