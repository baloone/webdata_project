{"id":"220605666_A_Very_Brief_History_of_Artificial_Intelligence","abstract":"â–  In this brief history, the beginnings of artificial in- telligence are traced to philosophy, fiction, and imagination. Early inventions in electronics, engi- neering, and many other disciplines have influ- enced AI. Some early milestones include work in problems solving which included basic work in learning, knowledge representation, and inference as well as demonstration programs in language un- derstanding, translation, theorem proving, associa- tive memory, and knowledge-based systems.
