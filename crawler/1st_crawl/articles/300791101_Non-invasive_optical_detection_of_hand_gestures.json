{"id":"300791101_Non-invasive_optical_detection_of_hand_gestures","abstract":"In this paper we present a novel type of sensing technology for hand and finger gesture recognition that utilizes light in the invisible spectrum to detect changes in position and form of body tissue like tendons and muscles. The proposed system can be easily integrated with existing wearable devices. Our approach not only enables gesture recognition but it could potentially double to perform a variety of health related monitoring tasks (e.g. heart rate, stress).","authors":["Santiago Ortega-Avila","Bogdana Rakova","Sajid Sadi","Pranav Mistry"],"meta":["March 2015","DOI:10.1145/2735711.2735801","Conference: the 6th Augmented Human International Conference"],"references":["305400738_WristFlex_low-power_gesture_input_with_wrist-worn_pressure_sensors","221517876_Skinput_Appropriating_the_Body_as_an_Input_Surface","3921985_GestureWrist_and_GesturePad_unobtrusive_wearable_interactiondevices","3826076_Acceleration_sensing_glove_ASG","301389053_WristFlex","269294089_A_Usability_User_Study_Concerning_Free-Hand_Microgesture_and_Wrist-Worn_Sensors","257092538_Armband_adds_a_twitch_to_gesture_control","221568561_Hand_shape_classification_with_a_wrist_contour_sensor_Development_of_a_prototype_device"]}
