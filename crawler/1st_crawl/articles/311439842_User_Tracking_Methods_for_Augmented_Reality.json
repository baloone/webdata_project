{"id":"311439842_User_Tracking_Methods_for_Augmented_Reality","abstract":"â€”Augmented reality has been an active area of research for the last two decades or so. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the recent literature on tracking methods used in Augmented Reality applications, both for indoor and outdoor environments. After critical discussion of the methods used for tracking, the paper identifies limitations of the state-of-the-art techniques and suggests potential future directions to overcome the bottlenecks","authors":["Nadia Kanwal"],"meta":["January 2013","DOI:10.7763/IJCTE.2013.V5.654"],"references":["221221523_Online_6_DOF_Augmented_Reality_Registration_from_Natural_Features","220806536_Outdoor_Mapping_and_Navigation_Using_Stereo_Vision","220659891_A_Study_of_the_Rao-Blackwellised_Particle_Filter_for_Efficient_and_Accurate_Vision-Based_SLAM","220141628_Handheld_Augmented_Reality_for_underground_infrastructure_visualization","216813780_A_Survey_of_Mobile_and_Wireless_Technologies_for_Augmented_Reality_Systems_Preprint","6397818_MonoSLAM_real-time_single_camera_SLAM","6127195_Managing_Complex_Augmented_Reality_Models","4334417_Ninja_on_a_Plane_Automatic_Discovery_of_Physical_Planes_for_Augmented_Reality_Using_Visual_SLAM","3981745_Archeoguide_system_architecture_of_a_mobile_outdoor_augmented_reality_system","3210675_Toward_next-gen_mobile_AR_games","229466043_Fusion_of_Vision_and_Inertial_Data_for_Motion_and_Structure_Estimation","224332304_Jun_H_Vision-based_location_positioning_using_augmented_reality_for_indoor_navigation_IEEE_Trans_Consumer_Electron_543_954-962","220414418_Real-Time_Camera_Tracking_for_Mobile_Devices_The_VisiTrack_System","220141353_Ubiquitous_interaction_with_positioning_and_navigation_using_a_novel_light_sensor_based_information_transmission_system","7311823_3D_modeling_with_the_Tinmith_Mobile_Outdoor_augmented_reality_system","4334429_Parallel_Tracking_and_Mapping_for_Small_AR_Workspaces","4009781_VIS-Tracker_A_wearable_vision-inertial_self-tracker","3423983_Natural_Feature_Tracking_for_Augmented_Reality","3031401_Pose_estimation_using_line-based_dynamic_vision_and_inertial_sensors"]}
