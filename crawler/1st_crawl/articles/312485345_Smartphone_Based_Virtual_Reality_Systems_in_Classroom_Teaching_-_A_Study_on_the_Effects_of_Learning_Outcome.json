It has been a topic of significant research and studies in recent years, given that 2016 is widely predicted to be the year where VR finds acceptability and affordability in mainstream consumer market. VR systems were first introduced to target entertainment and gaming, but numerous research and studies have shown its importance in educational purposes. There is a great potential in Virtual Reality Environments to serve as teaching aids in complementing and improving the education process. In spite of that, it is held back due to their bulky systems, complex setups and high cost, which limit their usage in versatile scenario.","authors":["Ananda Bibek Ray","Suman Deb"],"meta":["December 2016","DOI:10.1109/T4E.2016.022","Conference: 2016 IEEE Eighth International Conference on Technology for Education (T4E)"],"references":["268002587_Reasons_to_Use_Virtual_Reality_in_Education_and_Training_Courses_and_a_Model_to_Determine_When_to_Use_Virtual_Reality","267771977_Virtual_Reality_in_Chemical_Engineering_Education","258559446_Mass_Effect_A_Chemical_Engineering_Education_Application_of_Virtual_Reality_Simulator_Technology","247920944_The_Investigation_and_Application_of_Virtual_Reality_as_an_Educational_Tool","268901135_The_Design_Experiments","242400296_A_Revision_of_Bloom's_Taxonomy_An_Overview","200772925_A_conceptual_basis_for_educational_applications_of_virtual_reality","30876428_Education_Uses_of_Virtual_Reality_Technology"]}
