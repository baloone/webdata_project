{"id":"270812316_Discrete_Mathematics_and_its_applications","abstract":"The article gives ideas that lecturers of undergraduate Discrete Mathematics courses can use in order to make the subject\nmore interesting for students and encourage them to undertake further studies in the subject. It is possible to teach Discrete\nMathematics with little or no reference to computing. However, students are more likely to be interested in a subject if they\nare able to appreciate its use. There is, therefore, a strong case for teaching Discrete Mathematics in context. Lecturers\nare faced with the task of conveying mathematical material, some of which is new to students and some of which they will have\nmet before. Lecturers must attempt to foster mathematical dexterity. All of this takes time. Teaching the subject in context\ncan be achieved using little, or no, additional time. Of the wide range of Computer Science subjects, Artificial Intelligence\nand Software Agents are particularly rich in problems that are easy to understand and for which mathematics is needed in order\nto formally describe the problem as well as to solve it.","authors":["Alan Oxley"],"meta":["August 2010Teaching Mathematics and its Applications 29(3):155-163","DOI:10.1093/teamat/hrq007","Project: Discrete Mathematics"],"references":["220541805_A_basic_agent","220337351_Continuous_and_Hybrid_Petri_Nets"]}
