{"id":"328519461_To_Cluster_or_Not_to_Cluster_An_Analysis_of_Clusterability_Methods","abstract":"Clustering is an essential data mining tool that aims to discover inherent cluster structure in data. For most applications, applying clustering is only appropriate when cluster structure is present. As such, the study of clusterability, which evaluates whether data possesses such structure, is an integral part of cluster analysis. However, methods for evaluating clusterability vary radically, making it challenging to select a suitable measure. In this paper, we perform an extensive comparison of measures of clusterability and provide guidelines that clustering users can reference to select suitable measures for their applications.","authors":["Andreas Adolfsson","Margareta Ackerman","Naomi Brownstein"],"meta":["October 2018Pattern Recognition 88","DOI:10.1016/j.patcog.2018.10.026"],"references":[]}
