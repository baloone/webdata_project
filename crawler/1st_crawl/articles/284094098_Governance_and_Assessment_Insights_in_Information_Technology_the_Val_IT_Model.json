{"id":"284094098_Governance_and_Assessment_Insights_in_Information_Technology_the_Val_IT_Model","abstract":"The purpose of this paper is the investigation of the relationship between information technology and value creation. In doing so, the paper presents a conceptual framework based on the Val IT model. This framework can assist companies in the selection, implementation and optimisation of IT investments to create long-term value. The paper is based on a qualitative approach with the inclusion of a single-method approach. Research is developed according to the study of national and international literature. Following an initial analysis of existing literature on the evaluation of company investments, research has been conducted through the Val IT method to assess these intangible assets. The sources of research are secondary in nature (documents, reports, newspaper articles, papers and scientific books). This methodology emphasises the connection between the modern services created in the knowledge economy and the application of new technologies, especially in the field of Information Technology. Val IT is a governance framework for creating business value from IT investments. It allows companies to increase the possibility of selecting investments with a high potential of value creation, as well as with a greater possibility of success in executing, creating, strengthening and using these services.","authors":["Rosa Lombardi","Manlio Del Giudice","Andrea Caputo","Federica Evangelista"],"meta":["March 2016Journal of the Knowledge Economy 7(1)","DOI:10.1007/s13132-015-0328-6"],"references":["291232768_Unlocking_Sustained_Business_Value_from_IT_Investments","283868906_E-business_organizational_innovation_and_firm_performance_in_manufacturing_SMEs_an_empirical_study_in_Spain","321516676_Researching_Business_and_Management","319393719_Social_Capital_and_Information_Technology","316789389_Integration_Strategies_and_Tactics_for_Information_Technology_Governance","314457003_Structures_Processes_and_Relational_Mechanisms_for_IT_Governance","314418332_Integration_Strategies_and_Tactics_for_Information_Technology_Governance","313153055_Aligning_business_and_IT_strategies","292595182_The_management_of_intellectual_property","285736577_Social_capital_and_information_technology_Current_debates_and_research"]}
