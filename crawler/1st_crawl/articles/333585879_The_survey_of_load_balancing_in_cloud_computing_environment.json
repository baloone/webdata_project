{"id":"333585879_The_survey_of_load_balancing_in_cloud_computing_environment","abstract":"Day by Day increasing traffic on internet introduces the need of load balancing conception to induce the most utilization of the resources available on Cloud. The load balancing becomes a vital purpose for performance and stability of the system. Therefore, it's required AN algorithmic rule for enhancing the system performance by balancing work among VMs. Methods: Task scheduling algorithms are used to achieve the load balancing and QoS. Cloud computing is a completely internet-based approach wherever all the applications and files are hosted on a cloud that consists of thousands of computers interlinked along during a complicated manner. A load balancing algorithmic rule tries to enhance the response time of userâ€™s submitted applications by ensuring maximal utilization of accessible resources. The most objective of load balancing ways is to speed up the execution of applications on resources whose work varies at run time in unpredictable method.","authors":["Ankita Singh"],"meta":["March 2018APTIKOM Journal on Computer Science and Information Technologies 3(1):31-36","DOI:10.11591/APTIKOM.J.CSIT.83"],"references":["316458851_An_Efficient_Load_Balancing_Scheme_for_Cloud_Computing","309589755_A_Study_of_a_New_Dynamic_Load_Balancing_Approach_in_Cloud_Environment","293044030_Load_Balancing_in_Cloud_Computing_Environment_Using_Improved_Weighted_Round_Robin_Algorithm_for_Nonpreemptive_Dependent_Tasks","257726215_A_Priority_Based_Job_Scheduling_Algorithm_in_Cloud_Computing","284958521_Honey_bee_behavior_inspired_load_balancing_of_tasks_in_cloud_computing_environments","260585650_Optimal_Power_Allocation_and_Load_Distribution_for_Multiple_Heterogeneous_Multicore_Server_Processors_across_Clouds_and_Data_Centers","260357894_Dynamic_Resource_Allocation_Using_Virtual_Machines_for_Cloud_Computing_Environment","259044145_Meeting_Deadlines_of_Scientific_Workflows_in_Public_Clouds_with_Tasks_Replication","257890562_Adaptive_workflow_scheduling_for_dynamic_grid_and_cloud_computing_environment"]}
