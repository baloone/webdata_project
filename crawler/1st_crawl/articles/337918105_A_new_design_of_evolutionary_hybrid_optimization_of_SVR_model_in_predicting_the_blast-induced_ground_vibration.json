{"id":"337918105_A_new_design_of_evolutionary_hybrid_optimization_of_SVR_model_in_predicting_the_blast-induced_ground_vibration","abstract":"This study aims to identify the suitability of hybridizing the firefly algorithm (FA), genetic algorithm (GA), and particle swarm optimization (PSO) with two well-known data-driven models of support vector regression (SVR) and artificial neural network (ANN) to predict blast-induced ground vibration. Here, these combinations are abbreviated using FA–SVR, PSO–SVR, GA–SVR, FA–ANN, PSO–ANN, and GA–ANN models. In addition, a modified FA (MFA) combined with SVR model is also proposed in this study, namely, MFA–SVR. The feasibility of the proposed models is examined using a case study, located in Johor, Malaysia. Then, to provide an objective assessment of performances of the predictive models, their results were compared based on several well known and popular statistical criteria. According to the results, the MFA–SVR with the coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.984 and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.614 was more accurate model to predict PPV than the PSO–SVR with R2 = 0.977 and RMSE = 0.725, the FA–SVR with R2 = 0.964 and RMSE = 0.923, the GA–SVR with R2 = 0.957 and RMSE = 1.016, the GA–ANN with R2 = 0.936 and RMSE = 1.252, the FA–ANN with R2 = 0.925 and RMSE = 1.368, and the PSO–ANN with R2 = 0.924 and RMSE = 1.366. Consequently, the MFA–SVR model can be sufficiently employed in estimating the ground vibration, and has the capacity to generalize.","authors":["Wusi Chen","Mahdi Hasanipanah","Hima Nikafshan Rad","Danial Jahed Armaghani"],"meta":["April 2021Engineering with Computers 37(9)","DOI:10.1007/s00366-019-00895-x"],"references":["349319694_Performance_evaluation_of_hybrid_FFA-ANFIS_and_GA-ANFIS_models_to_predict_particle_size_distribution_of_a_muck-pile_after_blasting","336908575_Prediction_of_Blast-Induced_Ground_Vibration_in_Open-Pit_Mines_Using_a_New_Technique_Based_on_Imperialist_Competitive_Algorithm_and_M5Rules","335730741_GA-SVR_a_novel_hybrid_data-driven_model_to_simulate_vertical_load_capacity_of_driven_piles","334895686_ORELM_A_Novel_Machine_Learning_Approach_for_Prediction_of_Flyrock_in_Mine_Blasting","334771878_Predicting_blast-induced_peak_particle_velocity_using_BGAMs_ANN_and_SVM_a_case_study_at_the_Nui_Beo_open-pit_coal_mine_in_Vietnam","349319583_Prediction_of_Vibration_Velocity_Generated_in_Mine_Blasting_Using_Support_Vector_Regression_Improved_by_Optimization_Algorithms","336651539_Predicting_the_shear_strength_of_reinforced_concrete_beams_using_Artificial_Neural_Networks","334210160_Intelligent_Prediction_of_Blasting-Induced_Ground_Vibration_Using_ANFIS_Optimized_by_GA_and_PSO","333668949_A_Novel_Artificial_Intelligence_Approach_to_Predict_Blast-Induced_Ground_Vibration_in_Open-Pit_Mines_Based_on_the_Firefly_Algorithm_and_Artificial_Neural_Network","333649499_Slope_stability_prediction_for_circular_mode_failure_using_gradient_boosting_machine_approach_based_on_an_updated_database_of_case_histories","331399268_Developing_an_XGBoost_model_to_predict_blast-induced_peak_particle_velocity_in_an_open-pit_mine_a_case_study","331073689_Developing_an_innovative_soft_computing_scheme_for_prediction_of_air_overpressure_resulting_from_mine_blasting_using_GMDH_optimized_by_GA","332865654_Novel_Soft_Computing_Model_for_Predicting_Blast-Induced_Ground_Vibration_in_Open-Pit_Mines_Based_on_Particle_Swarm_Optimization_and_XGBoost","331451650_Prediction_of_Blast-Induced_Ground_Vibration_in_an_Open-Pit_Mine_by_a_Novel_Hybrid_Model_Based_on_Clustering_and_Artificial_Neural_Network","331312666_Feasibility_of_Stochastic_Gradient_Boosting_Approach_for_Evaluating_Seismic_Liquefaction_Potential_Based_on_SPT_and_CPT_Case_Histories"]}
