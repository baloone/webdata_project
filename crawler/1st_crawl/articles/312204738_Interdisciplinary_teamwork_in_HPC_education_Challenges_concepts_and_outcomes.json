{"id":"312204738_Interdisciplinary_teamwork_in_HPC_education_Challenges_concepts_and_outcomes","abstract":"We present our concept “Teamwork Across Disciplines” which enables interdisciplinary teamwork and soft skill training at course level. The concept is realized in the scope of the course “Turbulent Flow Simulation on HPC-Systems”. We describe the course curriculum and detail various additional aspects of the course with regard to student feedback, continuous course development techniques, and the student team projects.","authors":["Philipp Neumann","Christoph Kowitz","Felix S.
