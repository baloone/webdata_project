{"id":"332762681_I_Need_Somebody_to_Lean_on_The_Effect_of_Peer_Relative_and_Supervisor_Support_on_Emotions_Perceived_Progress_and_Persistence_in_Different_Stages_of_Doctoral_Advancement","abstract":"In the literature, social support is depicted as an important determinant of whether someone completes their doctoral process. However, few studies actually test the impact of social support in sound quantitative designs. The present study provides an incremental understanding of the social support effect by (a) assessing the joint influence of three sources of social support (supervisor, academic peers, and relatives) on the emotions of doctoral students, their perceived progress and intention to persist; and (b) testing the interactions between these three sources of support and the doctoral stage of advancement. To this end, we carried out a longitudinal three-wave study with 446 doctoral students from two Belgian universities. The hierarchical regressions showed that (1) only supervisor support significantly predicted the outcomes of doctoral students and (2) the influence of social support on intention to persist was moderated by the stage of advancement in the doctoral journey. We discuss these results and their implications for further work on social support in light of existing literature on doctoral persistence.","authors":["MikaÃ«l De Clercq","Christelle Devos","Assaad Azzi","Mariane Frenay"],"meta":["April 2019Swiss Journal of Psychology 78(3-4):1-13","DOI:10.1024/1421-0185/a000224","Projects: Learning environment, motivation, and (dis)engagementDoctoral completion process"],"references":["345641400_Internal_Motivation_among_Doctoral_Students_Contributions_from_the_Student_and_from_the_Student's_Environment","327054641_Who_Are_the_Doctoral_Students_Who_Drop_Out_Factors_Associated_with_the_Rate_of_Doctoral_Degree_Completion_in_Universities","324809692_The_Delicate_Balance_to_Adjustment_A_Qualitative_Approach_of_Student's_Transition_to_the_First_Year_at_University","320654776_Feeling_the_Doctorate_Is_Doctoral_Research_that_Studies_the_Emotional_Labor_of_Doctoral_Students_Possible","317151575_Misfits_Between_Doctoral_Students_and_Their_Supervisors_How_Are_They_Regulated","350992849_Nevertheless_She_Persisted_Gender_Peer_Effects_in_Doctoral_STEM_Programs","345760180_Contrasting_the_Socialization_Experiences_of_Doctoral_Students_in_High-_and_Low-Completing_Departments_A_Qualitative_Analysis_of_Disciplinary_Contexts_at_One_Institution","324434673_Work_Stress_and_Social_Support","320664070_Doctoral_Students'_Social_Support_Profiles_and_Their_Relationship_to_Burnout_Drop-Out_Intentions_and_Time_to_Candidacy","320655419_The_Relationships_between_Doctoral_Students'_Perceptions_of_Supervision_and_Burnout"]}
