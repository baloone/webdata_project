{"id":"221345076_Fast_support_vector_machine_training_and_classification_on_graphics_processors","abstract":"Recent developments in programmable, highly parallel Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have enabled high performance implementations of machine learning algo- rithms. We describe a solver for Support Vector Machine training running on a GPU, using the Sequential Minimal Optimization algorithm and an adaptive rst and second order working set selection heuristic, which achieves speedups of 9-35 over LIBSVM running on a traditional processor. We also present a GPU-based system for SVM classication which achieves speedups of 81-138 over LIBSVM (5-24 over our own CPU based SVM classier).","authors":["Bryan C.
