{"id":"262488808_Discrete_Convexity_and_Polynomial_Solvability_in_Minimum_0-Extension_Problems","abstract":"A \\(0\\)-extension of graph \\(\\varGamma \\) is a metric \\(d\\) on a set \\(V\\) containing the vertex set \\(V_{\\varGamma }\\) of \\(\\varGamma \\) such that \\(d\\) extends the shortest path metric of \\(\\varGamma \\) and for all \\(x \\in V\\) there exists a vertex \\(s\\) in \\(\\varGamma \\) with \\(d(x,s) = 0\\). The minimum \\(0\\)-extension problem 0-Ext\n\\([\\varGamma ]\\) on \\(\\varGamma \\) is: given a set \\(V \\supseteq V_{\\varGamma }\\) and a nonnegative cost function \\(c\\) defined on the set of all pairs of \\(V\\), find a \\(0\\)-extension \\(d\\) of \\(\\varGamma \\) with \\(\\sum _{xy}c(xy) d(x,y)\\) minimum. The \\(0\\)-extension problem generalizes a number of basic combinatorial optimization problems, such as minimum \\((s,t)\\)-cut problem and multiway cut problem. Karzanov proved the polynomial solvability of 0-Ext\n\\([\\varGamma ]\\) for a certain large class of modular graphs \\(\\varGamma \\), and raised the question: What are the graphs \\(\\varGamma \\) for which 0-Ext\n\\([\\varGamma ]\\) can be solved in polynomial time? He also proved that 0-Ext\n\\([\\varGamma ]\\) is NP-hard if \\(\\varGamma \\) is not modular or not orientable (in a certain sense). In this paper, we prove the converse: if \\(\\varGamma \\) is orientable and modular, then 0-Ext\n\\([\\varGamma ]\\) can be solved in polynomial time. This completes the classification of graphs \\(\\varGamma \\) for which 0-Ext\n\\([\\varGamma ]\\) is tractable. To prove our main result, we develop a theory of discrete convex functions on orientable modular graphs, analogous to discrete convex analysis by Murota, and utilize a recent result of Thapper and Živný on valued CSP.","authors":["Hiroshi Hirai"],"meta":["May 2014Mathematical Programming 155(1)","DOI:10.1007/s10107-014-0824-7","SourcearXiv"],"references":["267187118_A_characterization_of_greedy_sets_Universal_polymatroids_I","266854558_Classification_of_graphs_by_metric_triangles","265687511_Weakly_Modular_Graphs_and_Nonpositive_Curvature","228623238_Metric_graph_theory_and_geometry_A_survey","222668441_Graphs_of_some_CAT0_complexes","220617696_The_Complexity_of_Multiterminal_Cuts","220567182_Hard_cases_of_the_multifacility_location_problem","220297294_Minimum_0-Extensions_of_Graph_Metrics","220090397_One_more_well-solved_case_of_the_multifacility_location_problem","200712530_Gated_sets_in_metric_spaces","321514881_Algorithms_and_Combinatorics","313627189_Valued_constraint_satisfaction_problems_hard_and_easy_problems","285127877_Submodular_functions_and_convexity","280686814_Discrete_convex_analysis","280172513_A_Min-Max_Theorem_for_Transversal_Submodular_Functions_and_Its_Implications","277281464_Lattice_Theory","268164201_Skew_Bisubmodularity_and_Valued_CSPs","267058482_Theory_of_Convex_Structures","266987069_Mathematical_Programming_The_State_of_the_Art","266187533_The_Complexity_of_Valued_Constraint_Satisfaction_Problems","265579658_Constraint_Satisfaction_Problems","262967939_A_multifacility_location_problem_on_median_spaces","259523660_Generalized_skew_bisubmodularity_A_characterization_and_a_min-max_theorem","258727797_The_complexity_of_finite-valued_CSPs","258566832_The_Power_of_Linear_Programming_for_General-Valued_CSPs","257479849_Half-integrality_of_node-capacitated_multiflows_and_tree-shaped_facility_locations_on_trees","256926255_Towards_Minimizing_k-Submodular_Functions","256199744_Oracle_Tractability_of_Skew_Bisubmodular_Functions","254910467_Tree_Network_and_Planar_Rectilinear_Location_Theory","242985071_Polyhedra_related_to_undirected_multicommodity_flows","242444923_Submodular_Functions_and_Optimization","238727906_A_Cut_Approach_to_the_Rectilinear_Distance_Facility_Location_Problem","230570499_The_Power_of_Linear_Programming_for_Finite-Valued_CSPs_A_Constructive_Characterization","229792115_Modular_Interval_Spaces","227445353_State_of_the_Art---Location_on_Networks_A_Survey_Part_II_Exploiting_Tree_Network_Structure","226811774_Directed_submodularity_ditroids_and_directed_submodular_flows","226210003_Hereditary_modular_graphs","225841246_Discrete_Convex_Analysis_--_Exposition_on_Conjugacy_and_Duality","225129615_Proximity_theorems_of_discrete_convex_functions","223123944_Pseudomatroids","222700941_Tight_spans_of_distances_and_the_dual_fractionality_of_undirected_multiflow_problems","222514750_A_Combinatorial_Algorithm_Minimizing_Submodular_Functions_in_Strongly_Polynomial_Time","222262194_Networks_with_Condorcet_solutions","221591297_The_Maximum_Multiflow_Problems_with_Bounded_Fractionality","220779920_The_complexity_of_conservative_valued_CSPs","220532793_Multimatroids_I_Coverings_by_Independent_Sets","220532648_Folder_Complexes_and_Multiflow_Combinatorial_Dualities","220430827_A_combinatorial_strongly_polynomial_algorithm_for_minimizing_submodular_functions","220090537_New_algorithms_for_convex_cost_tension_problem_with_application_to_computer_vision","216877580_Geometric_Algorithms_and_Combinatorial_Optimization","51945353_The_Complexity_of_Conservative_Valued_CSPs","45928047_Submodularity_on_a_Tree_Unifying_Lnatural_-Convex_and_Bisubmodular_Functions","30814834_Fundamentals_in_Discrete_Convex_Analysis","24344142_On_the_Complexity_of_Submodular_Function_Minimisation_on_Diamonds","3832156_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Classification_Problems_with_Pairwise_Relationships_Metric_Labeling_and_Markov_Random_Fields"]}
