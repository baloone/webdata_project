{"id":"314111218_PPVT_A_tool_to_visualize_predictive_parsing","abstract":"The use of a Predictive Parsing Visualization Tool (PPVT) as a teaching aid in a course on compiler construction offered in the fall of 2015 helped students better understand the predictive parsing as they reported in a survey after the course. PPVT takes as input a grammar, calculates the FIRST and FOLLOW sets, and constructs the parsing table. Then for a given string, PPVT performs table-driven parsing and displays the parse tree and the leftmost derivation.","authors":["Aashi Jain","Archita Goyal","Pinaki Chakraborty"],"meta":["February 2017ACM Inroads 8(1):43-47","DOI:10.1145/3002136"],"references":["221538720_Animating_parsing_algorithms","221538070_Parser_visualization_for_developing_grammars_with_YACC","220955852_VAST_visualization_of_abstract_syntax_trees_within_language_processors_courses","3050829_An_educational_tool_for_teaching_compiler_construction","294118606_VCOCO","291376462_LLparse_and_LRparse","264227456_A_New_Practicum_in_Compiler_Construction","262202806_VisiCLANG-a_visible_compiler_for_CLANG","246579200_JFLAP-An_Interactive_Formal_Languages_and_Automata_Package","234793698_Design_and_Implementation_of_the_UW_Illustrated_Compiler","234785661_Using_visualization_tools_to_teach_compiler_design","220808098_An_environment_for_supporting_active_learning_in_courses_on_language_processing","2860359_LLparse_and_LRparse_Visual_and_Interactive_Tools_for_Parsing"]}
