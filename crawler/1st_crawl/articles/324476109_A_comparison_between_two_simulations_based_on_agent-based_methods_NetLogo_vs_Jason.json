{"id":"324476109_A_comparison_between_two_simulations_based_on_agent-based_methods_NetLogo_vs_Jason","abstract":"Todayâ€™s evolution of technology and computer science has pushed the researchers to solve different\neconomic problems with new approaches. A new rising approach is the usage of agent-based methods,\nwhich is mostly used to simulate artificial economic problems. In this article, we present two\nmethodologies for two similar problems. The two methodologies are based on two platforms; Jason and\nNetlogo, which are used to simulate and give solution to the port container terminal and the warehouse\nmanagement. A description of these problems is given, and the main development issues of the\nsimulators are being discussed. Also the implementation and their results will be given. Lastly, a\ncomparison review of the agent-based methods used and recommendations on their usage is provided.","authors":["Igli Hakrama","Neki Frasheri"],"meta":["November 2016","Project: Agent-based modeling and simulation in Economy"],"references":["313114459_The_effective_usage_of_Durres_Seaport_Container_Terminal_capacity_using_an_Agent-based_modelling_approach","312833759_Artificial_Economy_and_the_usage_of_ACE","284205394_A_Survey_of_Agent_Platforms","275340880_Factors_affecting_seaport_capacity","230818221_NetLogo_A_simple_environment_for_modeling_complexity","221907156_Modelling_and_Simulation_of_an_Automated_Warehouse_for_the_Comparison_of_Storage_Strategies","220365334_Agent-based_computing_from_multi-agent_systems_to_agent-based_Models_a_visual_survey","318006439_Artificial_Economics_What_Why_and_How","260135032_Programming_Multi-Agent_Systems_in_AgentSpeak_Using_Jason","220954159_An_agent-based_approach_to_modeling_yard_cranes_at_seaport_container_terminals","2398283_Efficient_Java_RMI_for_Parallel_Programming","200027549_An_Introduction_to_MultiAgent_Systems"]}
