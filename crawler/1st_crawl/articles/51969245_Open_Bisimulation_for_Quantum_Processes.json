{"id":"51969245_Open_Bisimulation_for_Quantum_Processes","abstract":"Quantum processes describe concurrent communicating systems that may involve\nquantum information. We propose a notion of open bisimulation for quantum\nprocesses and show that it provides both a sound and complete proof methodology\nfor a natural extensional behavioural equivalence between quantum processes. We\nalso give a modal characterisation of open bisimulation, by extending the\nHennessy-Milner logic to a quantum setting.","authors":["Yuxin Deng","Yuan Feng"],"meta":["September 2012","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-33475-7_9","SourcearXiv","Conference: Proceedings of the 7th IFIP TC 1/WG 202 international conference on Theoretical Computer Science"],"references":["313362443_Contextual_equivalence_for_higher-order_pi-calculus_revisited","313348395_Contextual_equivalence_for_higher-order_pi-calculus_revisited","286962749_Model_Checking_for_Communicating_Quantum_Processes","270956456_A_Calculus_of_Mobile_Processes_Parts_I_and_II","269961542_Markov_Decision_Processes","266425464_The_p-Calculus_A_Theory_of_Mobile_Processes","260545995_States_Effects_and_Operations_Fundamental_Notions_of_Quantum_Theory","260037497_On_the_Semantics_of_Markov_Automata","255904253_Quantum_Mechanics_Helps_in_Searching_for_a_Needle_in_a_Haystack","252727455_Comet_Halley_a_novel"]}
