To reach its technological goals, it is requiring adequate approaches to understand how to combine physical restrictions, computational approaches and technological requirements to get functional universal quantum information processing. This work presents the modeling and the analysis of certain general type of Hamiltonian representing several physical systems used in quantum information and establishing a dynamics reduction in a natural grammar for bipartite processing based on entangled states.","authors":["Francisco Javier Delgado-Cepeda"],"meta":["December 2017Journal of Physics Conference Series 936(1):012070","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/936/1/012070","Project: SU(2) reduction of multipartite two level systems"],"references":["310595042_Universal_Quantum_Gates_for_Quantum_Computation_on_Magnetic_Systems_Ruled_by_Heisenberg-Ising_Interactions","267153334_Algebraic_and_group_structure_for_bipartite_three_dimensional_anisotropic_Ising_model_on_a_non-local_basis","231108568_A_complete_basis_of_generalized_Bell_states","2197176_Time_Minimal_Trajectories_for_a_Spin_12_Particle_in_a_Magnetic_Field","317170300_Stability_of_Quantum_Loops_and_Exchange_Operations_in_the_Construction_of_Quantum_Computation_Gates","237243628_Quantum_Theory_the_Church-Turing_Principle_and_the_Universal_Quantum_Computer","226810696_Simulating_physics_with_computers_Int_J_Theor_Phys_2167467-488","13245023_Ekert_AK_Quantum_Cryptography_Based_on_Bell's_Theorem_Phys_Rev_Lett_676_661","13227501_Error_Correcting_Codes_in_Quantum_Theory","3024070_Optimal_Control_of_Two_Level_Quantum_Systems"]}
