{"id":"316502780_Coauthorship_network_in_transportation_research","abstract":"The field of transportation research has been accelerating in the last decade. In this paper, we examine the structure of scientific collaboration in transportation research by building a coauthorship network using publication metadata from 22 transportation journals. In this network, a vertex represents a researcher and an edge represents the collaboration (coauthorship) between a pair of researchers. To build an accurate network, we propose and apply an efficient author name correction algorithm. The obtained network provides us with a tool to understand patterns of collaborations in transportation research. The results show an increasing trend of collaboration over the studied period (1990â€“2015), but different journals exhibit different patterns. We characterize the structural properties of this network and compute several centrality measures to quantify the performance/impact of researchers and their collaborations in the research community. This study could serve as a tool to qualitatively and quantitatively understand scientific collaborations in transportation research.","authors":["Lijun Sun","Iyad Rahwan"],"meta":["June 2017Transportation Research Part A Policy and Practice 100:135-151","DOI:10.1016/j.tra.2017.04.011"],"references":["313018559_Discovering_themes_and_trends_in_transportation_research_using_topic_modeling","301865836_Network_Structure_Self-Organization_and_the_Growth_of_International_Collaboration_in_Science","281425954_A_Scientometric_Analysis_of_Public_Transport_Research","280924121_Publishing_Transport_Research_Are_We_Learning_Much_of_Use","258168189_Citation_counts_in_transportation_research","229518195_Author_name_disambiguation_for_collaboration_network_analysis_and_visualization","335010115_The_demise_of_the_lone_author","317084030_The_PageRank_citation_ranking_Bringing_order_to_the_Web_Technical_report","232280309_Collaborations_The_Rise_of_Research_Networks","228253542_Co-Authorship_in_Management_and_Organizational_Studies_An_Empirical_and_Network_Analysis"]}
