{"id":"288160284_On-line_String_Matching_in_Highly_Similar_DNA_Sequences","abstract":"We consider the problem of on-line exact string matching of a pattern in a set of highly similar sequences. This can be useful in cases where indexing the sequences is not feasible. We present a preliminary study by restricting the problem for a specific case where we adapt the classical Morris-Pratt algorithm to consider borders with errors. We give an original algorithm for computing borders at Hamming distance 1. We exhibit experimental results showing that our algorithm is much faster than searching for the pattern in each sequences with a very fast on-line exact string matching algorithm.","authors":["Nadia Ben Nsira","Thierry Lecroq","Mourad Elloumi"],"meta":["June 2017Mathematics in Computer Science 1146(2):16-22","DOI:10.1007/s11786-016-0280-2"],"references":["263971775_Journaled_String_Tree_-_A_scalable_data_structure_for_analyzing_thousands_of_similar_genomes_on_your_laptop","236651605_Suffix_Tree_of_Alignment_An_Efficient_Index_for_Similar_Data","223985398_High_frequency_of_potentially_pathogenic_SORL1_mutations_in_autosomal_dominant_early-onset_Alzheimer_disease","268862803_Algorithms_on_strings_Translated_from_the_2001_French_original","262296502_The_Exact_Online_String_Matching_Problem_A_Review_of_the_Most_Recent_Results","261674312_Fast_Relative_Lempel-Ziv_Self-index_for_Similar_Sequences","259338888_Suffix_Array_of_Alignment_A_Practical_Index_for_Similar_Data","257705049_Querying_Highly_Similar_Structured_Sequences_via_Binary_Encoding_and_Word_Level_Operations","257704959_On_the_repetitive_collection_indexing_problem","225682144_Indexing_Similar_DNA_Sequences","221241593_Efficient_Variants_of_the_Backward-Oracle-Matching_Algorithm","221579918_Relative_Lempel-Ziv_Compression_of_Genomes_for_Large-Scale_Storage_and_Retrieval","221313943_A_Simple_Fast_Hybrid_Pattern-Matching_Algorithm","220787574_Indexing_DNA_Sequences_Using_q-Grams","220779508_Faster_algorithms_for_string_matching_with"]}
