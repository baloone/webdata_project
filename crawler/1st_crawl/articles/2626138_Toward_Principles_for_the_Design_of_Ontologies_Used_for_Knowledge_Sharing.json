{"id":"2626138_Toward_Principles_for_the_Design_of_Ontologies_Used_for_Knowledge_Sharing","abstract":"Recent work in Artificial Intelligence (AI) is exploring the use of formal ontologies as a way of specifying content-specific agreements for the sharing and reuse of knowledge among software entities. We take an engineering perspective on the development of such ontologies. Formal ontologies are viewed as designed artifacts, formulated for specific purposes and evaluated against objective design criteria. We describe the role of ontologies in supporting knowledge sharing activities, and then present a set of criteria to guide the development of ontologies for these purposes. We show how these criteria are applied in case studies from the design of ontologies for engineering mathematics and bibliographic data. Selected design decisions are discussed, and alternative representation choices are evaluated against the design criteria.","authors":["Thomas Gruber"],"meta":["August 1994International Journal of Human-Computer Studies 43(5-6)","DOI:10.1006/ijhc.1995.1081"],"references":["259365876_A_comparison_of_languages_which_operationalize_and_formalize_KADS_models_of_expertise","243764255_Formalization_of_knowledge-level_models_for_knowledge_acquisition","222459556_Concepts_attributes_and_arbitrary_relations_Some_linguistic_and_ontological_criteria_for_structuring_knowledge_bases","221603294_Time_Representation_A_Taxonomy_of_Internal_Relations","221049035_The_TOVE_Project_Towards_a_Common-Sense_Model_of_the_Enterprise","220605114_Enabling_Technology_for_Knowledge_Sharing","220426580_CYC_Toward_programs_with_common_sense","21759235_Dimensions_of_knowledge_sharing_and_reuse","2954163_PACT_An_Experiment_in_Integrating_Concurrent_Engineering_Systems","319393990_Knowledge_Interchange_Format_Version_30_Reference_Manual","319393908_Logical_foundations_of_artificial_intelligence","319393669_A_General_Organization_of_Knowledge_for_Natural_Language_Processing_the_Penman_Upper_Model","260145928_Ontological_Issues_in_Knowledge_Base_Design_Some_Problems_and_Suggestions","256487817_Logical_Foundation_of_Artificial_Intelligence","251442360_Specification_of_the_KQML_Agent-Communication_Language","246810928_Metamodel_An_Integrated_Modeling_Framework_for_Intelligent_CAD","246620433_Knowledge_Sharing_Technology_Project_Overview","244437488_A_Translation_Approach_to_Portable_Ontology_Specifications","243630563_YMIR_an_ontology_for_engineering_design","243510430_Contexts_A_Formalization_and_Some_Applications","239062069_A_Common_Knowledge_Representation_Integrating_Learning_Tools","239022399_An_Agent-Based_Framework_for_Software_Interoperability","238671873_Building_Large_Knowledge-Based_Systems_Representation_and_Inference_in_CYC","233743982_Knowledge_Acquisition_as_a_Modeling_Activity","229707928_Introduction_Knowledge_acquisition_as_modeling","225070561_Some_Philosophical_Problems_from_the_Standpoint_of_Artificial_Intelligence","225070516_Components_of_Expertise","223331028_Temporal_logics_in_AI_Semantical_and_ontological_considerations","222868289_Foundations_of_a_Functional_Approach_to_Knowledge_Representation","222361294_KADS_A_Modelling_Approach_to_Knowledge_Engineering","221393704_Knowledge_Interchange_Format","221393450_The_DARPA_Knowledge_Sharing_Effort_A_Progress_Report","221391217_Reusing_a_Large_Domain-Independent_Knowledge_Base","221365213_Empirical_Methods_for_Ontological_Engineering_-_Case_Study_Objects","220787886_The_Architecture_of_Future_Information_Systems_Abstract","220692379_A_Mathematical_Introduction_to_Logic","220546843_Towards_a_General_Theory_of_Action_and_Time","220107655_Generation_of_knowledge-acquisition_tools_from_domain_ontologies","35796515_A_formalism_for_object-based_information_systems_development_microform","2954089_Wiederhold_G_Mediators_in_the_Architecture_of_Future_Information_Systems_Computer_253_38-49","2639082_The_Role_of_Common_Ontology_in_Achieving_Sharable_Reusable_Knowledge_Bases","2638733_Toward_a_Knowledge_Medium_for_Collaborative_Product_Development","2637109_Ontolingua_A_Mechanism_to_Support_Portable_Ontologies"]}
