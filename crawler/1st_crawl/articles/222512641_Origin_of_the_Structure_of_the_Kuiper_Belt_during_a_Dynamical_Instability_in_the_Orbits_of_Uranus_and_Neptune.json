This model is characterized by a short, but violent, instability phase, during which the planets were on large eccentricity orbits. It successfully explains, for the first time, the current orbital architecture of the giant planets (Tsiganis et al. 2005), the existence of the Trojans populations of Jupiter and Neptune (Morbidelli et al. 2005), and the origin of the late heavy bombardment of the terrestrial planets (Gomes et al. 2005). One characteristic of this model is that the proto-planetary disk must have been truncated at roughly 30 to 35 AU so that Neptune would stop migrating at its currently observed location. As a result, the Kuiper belt would have initially been empty. In this paper we present a new dynamical mechanism which can deliver objects from the region interior to ∼ 35 AU to the Kuiper belt without excessive inclination excitation. In particular, we show that during the phase when Neptune’s","authors":["Harold F.
