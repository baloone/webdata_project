{"id":"341899983_A_Novel_Approach_for_Searching_an_Element_in_a_Sorted_Array_-_Log_Search","abstract":"In computer science, various searching algorithms are available. We choose among them according to the situation. There are some efficient searching algorithms like Binary Search, Jump Search etc. In this paper a new searching algorithm which tracks the key element faster in some cases is proposed. This algorithm is Log Search. This algorithm only works for a sorted array. This algorithm searches the key element in a sub-array of the full array. If there is no possibility to find the key element, it will try to find out the next\nsub-array. If there is a possibility to find it to that sub-array, then it will recursively do the same thing.","authors":["Arpan Bairagi","Rejoy Chakraborty","Shree Mitra","Soumya Paul"],"meta":["June 2020International Journal of Information Science and Computing 6(2):39-44","DOI:10.30954/2348-7437.2.2019.2"],"references":["335812006_Octonary_O_Search_Algorithm","259969110_An_Efficient_Algorithm_To_Detect_The_Nearest_Location_Of_A_Map_For_A_Given_Theme","225313240_Geometric_Applications_of_a_Matrix-Searching_Algorithm","314182838_A_Brief_Study_and_Analysis_of_Different_Searching_Algorithms","230916146_A_Simple_Void-searching_Algorithm","224960000_A_Fast_String_Searching_Algorithm","220427127_Jump_Searching_A_Fast_Sequential_Search_Technique","2566530_A_Fast_Algorithm_For_Multi-Pattern_Searching"]}
