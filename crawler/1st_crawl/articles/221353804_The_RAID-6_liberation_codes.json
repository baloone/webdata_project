{"id":"221353804_The_RAID-6_liberation_codes","abstract":"The RAID-6 specification calls for a storage system with multiple storage devices to tolerate the failure of any two devices. Numerous erasure coding techniques have been developed that can implement RAID-6; however, each has limitations. In this paper, we describe a new class of RAID-6 codes called the Liberation Codes .T hese codes encode, update and decode either optimally or close to optimally. Their modification overhead is lower than all other RAID-6 codes, and their encoding performance is often better as well. We provide an exact specification of the Liberation Codes and assess their performance in re- lation to other RAID-6 coding techniques. In the process, we describe an algorithm called bit matrix scheduling, which improves the performance of decoding drastically. Finally, we present a freely available library which facil- itates the use of Liberation Codes in RAID-6 sytems.","authors":["James Plank"],"meta":["January 2008","SourceDBLP","Conference: 6th USENIX Conference on File and Storage Technologies, FAST 2008, February 26-29, 2008, San Jose, CA, USA"],"references":["228932918_Jerasure_A_library_in_CC_facilitating_erasure_coding_for_storage_applications","273130028_The_Theory_of_Error-Correcting_Codes","265458700_Introduction_to_Coding_Theory","259860916_Polynomial_Codes_Over_Certain_Finite_Fields","258239683_The_theory_of_error-correcting_codes_Parts_I_II","247417879_Ro_w-diagonal_parity_for_double_disk_failure_correction","242827166_Error-Correcting_Codes_Second_Edition","236157565_Error_Correction_Coding_Mathematical_Methods_and_Algorithms","235410288_Error_Correcting_Codes","234795524_Global_common_subexpression_elimination"]}
