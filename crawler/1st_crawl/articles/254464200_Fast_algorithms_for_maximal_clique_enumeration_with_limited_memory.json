{"id":"254464200_Fast_algorithms_for_maximal_clique_enumeration_with_limited_memory","abstract":"Maximal clique enumeration (MCE) is a long-standing problem in graph theory and has numerous important applications. Though extensively studied, most existing algorithms become impractical when the input graph is too large and is disk-resident. We first propose an efficient partition-based algorithm for MCE that addresses the problem of processing large graphs with limited memory. We then further reduce the high cost of CPU computation of MCE by a careful nested partition based on a cost model. Finally, we parallelize our algorithm to further reduce the overall running time. We verified the efficiency of our algorithms by experiments in large real-world graphs.","authors":["James Cheng","Linhong Zhu","Yiping Ke","Shumo Chu"],"meta":["August 2012","DOI:10.1145/2339530.2339724"],"references":["281657889_The_inputoutput_complexity_of_sorting_and_related_problems","228990082_On_the_Relative_Efficiency_of_Maximal_Clique_Enumeration_Algorithms_with_Application_to_High-Throughput_Computational_Biology","228771835_Emergent_clique_formation_in_terrorist_recruitment","312600697_Algorithm_457_Finding_all_cliques_of_an_undirected_graph","311921312_Statistical_analysis_of_financial_networks","288271487_Enumerating_all_connected_maximal_common_subgraphs_in_two_graphs","275481246_Triangle_Listing_in_Massive_Networks","242921385_Estimating_the_Efficiency_of_Backtrack_Programs","232628213_A_Distributed_Algorithm_to_Enumerate_All_Maximal_Cliques_in_MapReduce","226427482_Finding_All_Maximal_Cliques_in_Dynamic_Graphs"]}
