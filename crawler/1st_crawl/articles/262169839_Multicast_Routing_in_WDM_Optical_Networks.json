{"id":"262169839_Multicast_Routing_in_WDM_Optical_Networks","abstract":"Multicasting is the ability to transmit information from a source to multiple destination nodes and is becoming an important requirement in high-speed networks. As WDM technology matures and multicast applications become increasingly popular, supporting multicast routing at WDM layer becomes an important and yet a challenging topic. In this chapter, the multicast routing in various WDM networks namely, broadcast-and-select networks, linear light-wave networks, and wavelength routed networks was discussed. Broadcast-and-select networks are inherent choice for providing multicast routing. However, the number of wavelengths and the receiver tuning latency are considered as the main problems. In this chapter, some solutions for the above problems were discussed.","authors":["N.
