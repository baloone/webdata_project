{"id":"225149162_Dafny_An_Automatic_Program_Verifier_for_Functional_Correctness","abstract":"Traditionally, the full verification of a programâ€™s functional correctness has been obtained with pen and paper or with interactive\nproof assistants, whereas only reduced verification tasks, such as extended static checking, have enjoyed the automation offered\nby satisfiability-modulo-theories (SMT) solvers. More recently, powerful SMT solvers and well-designed program verifiers are\nstarting to break that tradition, thus reducing the effort involved in doing full verification.\n\nThis paper gives a tour of the language and verifier Dafny, which has been used to verify the functional correctness of a\nnumber of challenging pointer-based programs. The paper describes the features incorporated in Dafny, illustrating their use\nby small examples and giving a taste of how they are coded for an SMT solver. As a larger case study, the paper shows the\nfull functional specification of the Schorr-Waite algorithm in Dafny.","authors":["K Rustan M Leino"],"meta":["December 2010","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-17511-4_20","SourceDBLP","Conference: Proceedings of the 16th international conference on Logic for programming, artificial intelligence, and reasoning"],"references":["250009902_ESCJava2_Uniting_ESCJava_and_JML_Progress_and_issues_in_building_and_using_ESCJava2","247232622_Preliminary_design_of_JML","234820909_An_efficient_machine-independent_procedure_for_garbage_collection_in_various_list_structures","234809269_Verification_of_Object-Oriented_Software_the_KeY_Approach","225727410_Boogie_A_Modular_Reusable_Verifier_for_Object-Oriented_Programs","225142568_Z3_an_efficient_SMT_solver","221602747_Verification_of_Equivalent-Results_Methods","221602509_A_Basis_for_Verifying_Multi-threaded_Programs","221496400_Regional_Logic_for_Local_Reasoning_about_Global_Invariants","221477308_Checking_Interference_with_Fractional_Permissions","221440161_A_Hoare_Logic_for_Call-by-Value_Functional_Programs","221321518_Ownership_encapsulation_and_the_disjointness_of_type_and_effect","221302273_VCC_A_Practical_System_for_Verifying_Concurrent_C","221268166_It's_Doomed_We_Can_Prove_It","221160603_Dafny_Meets_the_Verification_Benchmarks_Challenge","221160540_Incremental_Benchmarks_for_Software_Verification_Tools_and_Techniques","221115461_An_Automatic_Verifier_for_Java-Like_Programs_Based_on_Dynamic_Frames","221051160_Using_the_Spec_Language_Methodology_and_Tools_to_Write_Bug-Free_Programs","220999368_Reasoning_about_comprehensions_with_first-order_SMT_solvers","220997119_Separation_logic_abstraction_and_inheritance","220910193_SeL4_Formal_verification_of_an_OS_kernel","220852281_A_Polymorphic_Intermediate_Verification_Language_Design_and_Logical_Encoding","220299401_Verification_of_Object-Oriented_Programs_with_Invariants","213877735_Separation_logic_abstraction","2942131_Simplify_A_Theorem_Prover_for_Program_Checking","2887724_The_Spec_Programming_System_An_Overview","2874853_Verification_of_Object-Oriented_Programs_with_Invariants","314396450_Ownership_encapsulation_and_the_disjointness_of_type_and_effect","251398244_The_Schorr-Waite-Algorithm","243535321_Object_oriented_software_construction_series_in_computer_science","241769200_This_is_Boogie_2","238626536_SMT-LIB_The_Satisfiability_Modulo_Theories_Library","227007899_System_verification","223532192_Proving_Pointer_Programs_in_Higher-Order_Logic","221496318_Implicit_Dynamic_Frames_Combining_Dynamic_Frames_and_Separation_Logic","221403288_Verifying_the_Safety_of_a_Practical_Concurrent_Garbage_Collector","221403040_CVC3","221323183_A_Quick_Tour_of_the_VeriFast_Program_Verifier","221321205_Data_Groups_Specifying_the_Modification_of_Extended_State","221268379_Event_Based_Sequential_Program_Development_Application_to_Constructing_a_Pointer_Program","221268237_Dynamic_Frames_Support_for_Framing_Dependencies_and_Sharing_Without_Restrictions","220744123_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","220716199_VeriCool_An_Automatic_Verifier_for_a_Concurrent_Object-Oriented_Language","220404594_Combining_Algebraic_and_Algorithmic_Reasoning_An_Approach_to_the_Schorr-Waite_Algorithm","220130853_Modular_invariants_for_layered_object_structures","37470293_Full_Functional_Verification_of_Linked_Data_Structures","30873047_Object_Oriented_Software_Construction","29637557_The_WhyKrakatoaCaduceus_Platform_for_Deductive_Program_Verification","4214938_A_case_study_of_C_source_code_verification_The_Schorr-Waite_algorithm","3965916_Separation_logic_A_logic_for_shared_mutable_data_structures","2810618_An_Approach_to_Systems_Verification","2801852_Extended_Static_Checking","2529521_Extended_Static_Checking_for_Java","2802968_Specifying_the_Modification_of_Extended_State","2703494_Toward_Reliable_Modular_Programs"]}
