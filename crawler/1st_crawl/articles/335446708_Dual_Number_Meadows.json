{"id":"335446708_Dual_Number_Meadows","abstract":"The class of dual number meadows is introduced. By definition this class is a quasivariety. Dual number meadows contain a non-zero element the square of which is zero. These structures are non-involutive and coregular. Some properties of the equational theory of dual number meadows are discussed and an initial algebra specification is given for the minimal dual number meadow of characteristic zero which contains the dual rational numbers. Several open problems are stated.","authors":["Jan Bergstra"],"meta":["June 2019Transmathematica","DOI:10.36285/tm.v0i0.11"],"references":["282906250_Subvarieties_of_the_Variety_of_Meadows","266036168_Free_algebras_over_all_fields_and_pseudo-fields","263471497_Division_by_Zero_in_Common_Meadows","249812219_Perspex_Machine_VIII_axioms_of_transreal_arithmetic","285538863_Construction_of_the_Transcomplex_Numbers_From_the_Complex_Numbers","277885262_Note_on_paraconsistency_and_reasoning_about_fractions","262974724_Division_by_zero_in_non-involutive_meadows","258082303_Equations_for_formally_real_meadows","245125376_On_the_use_of_dual_numbers_vectors_and_matrices_in_instantaneous_spatial_kinematics","243113671_Equational_theories_and_universal_theories_of_fields","234800298_The_rational_numbers_as_an_abstract_data_type","239357162_Erratum_to_Dual_numbers_representation_of_rigid_body_dynamics_Mechanism_and_Machine_Theory_345_693-718","222830597_Meadows_and_the_equational_specification_of_division","222652039_Inversive_Meadows_and_Divisive_Meadows","220692511_Specification_of_Abstract_Data_Types"]}
