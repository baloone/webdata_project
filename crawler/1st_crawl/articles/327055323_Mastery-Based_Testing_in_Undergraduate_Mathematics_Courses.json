{"id":"327055323_Mastery-Based_Testing_in_Undergraduate_Mathematics_Courses","abstract":"Mastery-based testing is an assessment scheme that challenges students to provide complete solutions to problems derived from clear course concepts. Students are allowed multiple attempts to demonstrate mastery, which helps create a classroom environment where students value persistence toward thorough understanding. In this paper we describe in detail the benefits and implementation of mastery-based testing in college mathematics courses. We also summarize student response data that show positive reactions to this testing method.","authors":["James Burton Collins","Amanda Harsy Ramsay","Jarod Hart","Katie Anne Haymaker"],"meta":["August 2018PRIMUS: problems, resources, and issues in mathematics undergraduate studies 29(5)","DOI:10.1080/10511970.2018.1488317"],"references":["263259031_Making_the_grade_a_history_of_the_A-F_marking_scheme","241732987_What's_The_Point_The_Benefits_of_Grading_Without_Points","347289612_Comparing_Mastery-based_Testing_with_Traditional_Testing_in_Calculus_II","321154287_Specifications-Based_Grading_in_an_Introduction_to_Proofs_Course","240954339_A_method_of_applying_mastery_learning_to_moderately_large_classes","237501999_Boosting_achievement_with_messages_that_motivate","237009897_Self-Theories_Their_Role_in_Motivation_Personality_and_Development","233022586_Student_learning_objectives_and_mathematics_teaching","233018971_Self-Reflective_Grading_Getting_Students_to_Learn_from_their_Mistakes","232898251_An_objective_approach_to_student-centered_instruction","232436015_Effects_of_No_Feedback_Task-Related_Comments_and_Grades_on_Intrinsic_Motivation_and_Performance","232434613_Is_Math_a_Gift_Beliefs_That_Put_Females_at_Risk"]}
