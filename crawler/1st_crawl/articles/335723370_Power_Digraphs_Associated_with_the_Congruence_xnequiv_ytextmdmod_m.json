We enumerate the self and isolated loops and study the structures of this digraph for the numbers 2r\nand 7r, for every positive integer r. Further, we characterize the existence of cycles by employing Carmichael’s Theorem. Also, we discuss the sub-digraphs of proposed digraph induced by the vertices co-prime to m and not co-prime to m. Lastly, we characterize the regularity, semi-regularity and results regarding components of these subdigraphs.\nAMS (MOS) Subject Classification Codes: 35S29; 40S70; 25U09","authors":["Muhammad Khalid Mahmood","Muhammad Haris Mateen"],"meta":["May 2019"],"references":["330674081_A_Novel_Labeling_Algorithm_on_Several_Classes_of_Graphs","283342511_The_iteration_digraphs_of_finite_commutative_rings","258233744_On_Simple_Graphs_Arising_from_Exponential_Congruences","275986575_An_Introduction_to_the_Theory_of_Numbers","257548765_The_structure_of_digraphs_associated_with_the_congruence_x_k_y_mod_n","226367905_On_a_Connection_of_Number_Theory_with_Graph_Theory","223147033_The_graph_of_the_square_mapping_on_the_prime_fields","220115984_Some_digraphs_arising_from_number_theory_and_remarks_on_the_zero-divisor_graph_of_the_ring_Z"]}
