{"id":"317989127_Testing_the_Equality_of_Two_Independent_Regression_Models","abstract":"In some situations, for example in agriculture, biology, hydrology and psychology, researchers wish to determine whether the relationship between response variable and predictor variables differs in two populations. In other words, we interested in comparing two regression models for two independent datasets. In this work, we will use the parametric and nonparametric methods to establish hypothesis testing for the equality of two independent regression models. Then the simulation study is provided to investigate the performance of the proposed method.","authors":["Mohammad Reza Mahmoudi","Mohsen Maleki","Abbas Pak"],"meta":["June 2017Communication in Statistics- Theory and Methods","DOI:10.1080/03610926.2017.1343847"],"references":["322899250_Inference_on_the_Ratio_of_Correlations_of_Two_Independent_Populations","5142873_SimReg_A_Software_Includinge_Some_New_Developments_in_Multiple_Comparison_and_Simultaneous_Confidence_Bands_for_Linear_Regression_Models","309309777_On_the_probable_error_of_a_coefficient_of_correlation","290492120_Testing_the_Difference_between_Two_Independent_Regression_Models","268687536_Practical_Nonparametric_Statistics","266936515_The_Comparison_of_Regression_Variables","257199242_Some_new_methods_for_the_comparison_of_two_linear_regression_models","242591539_Individual_Comparisons_by_Ranking_Methods","232595192_Comparing_Correlated_but_Nonoverlapping_Correlations","232571871_Comparing_Correlated_Correlation_Coefficients","232488655_Tests_for_Comparing_Elements_of_a_Correlation_Matrix","222747369_Easy-to-construct_confidence_bands_for_comparing_two_simple_linear_regression_lines","208033440_Statistical_Methods_For_Psychology","46494157_Simultaneous_confidence_bands_for_all_contrasts_of_three_or_more_simple_linear_regression_models_over_an_interval","38368253_The_Selection_of_Variates_for_Use_in_Prediction_With_Some_Comments_on_the_General_Problem_of_Nuisance_Parameters","6664324_Pooling_batches_in_drug_stability_study_by_using_constant-width_simultaneous_confidence_bands","6463775_Operability_Region_Equivalence_Simultaneous_Confidence_Bands_for_the_Equivalence_of_Two_Regression_Models_over_Restricted_Regions","4812604_A_study_of_partial_F_tests_for_multiple_linear_regression_models"]}
