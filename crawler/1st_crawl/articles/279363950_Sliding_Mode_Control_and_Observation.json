{"id":"279363950_Sliding_Mode_Control_and_Observation","abstract":"Conventional sliding mode control, studied in Chap. 2, and second-order sliding mode control (Chap. 4) are the most obvious choices in controlling systems with bounded matched disturbances/uncertainties. Sliding mode control laws allow us achieve to insensitivity of systemâ€™s compensated dynamics to these perturbations. The ultimate price for this insensitivity is a high-frequency (that is equal to infinity in an ideal sliding mode) switching control function that after being filtered by the plant yields self-sustained oscillations of almost zero amplitude. The main advantage of higher (second-)order sliding mode control is its ability to guarantee higher accuracy of the sliding variable stabilization at zero than conventional sliding mode control.","authors":["Yuri Shtessel","C.
