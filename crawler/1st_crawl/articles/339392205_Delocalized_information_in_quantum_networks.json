{"id":"339392205_Delocalized_information_in_quantum_networks","abstract":"We consider entanglement-based quantum networks where information is stored in a delocalized way within regions or the whole network. This offers a natural protection against failure of network nodes, loss and decoherence, and has built-in security features. Quantum information is transmitted within the network by performing local measurements on individual nodes only. Information can be localized within regions or at a specific node by collaborative actions using only entanglement within a region, or sometimes even without entanglement. We discuss several examples based on error correction stabilizer codes, Dicke states and correlation space encodings. We show how to design fully functional networks using encoded states or correlation space resources.","authors":["Jorge Miguel Ramiro","Wolfgang Duer"],"meta":["February 2020New Journal of Physics 22(4)","DOI:10.1088/1367-2630/ab784d"],"references":["337454545_Quantum_Internet_Networking_Challenges_in_Distributed_Quantum_Computing","335672931_Quantum_network_routing_and_local_complementation","335194784_Optical_Interferometry_with_Quantum_Networks","333167029_End-to-end_capacities_of_a_quantum_communication_network","331031598_A_quantum_network_stack_and_protocols_for_reliable_entanglement-based_networks","328376157_Quantum_internet_A_vision_for_the_road_ahead","327325042_Quantum_internet_from_communication_to_distributed_computing","326615950_Distributed_Quantum_Metrology_with_Linear_Networks_and_Separable_Inputs","325142968_Transforming_graph_states_using_single-qubit_operations","337574914_Distributing_graph_states_over_arbitrary_quantum_networks"]}
