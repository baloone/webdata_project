{"id":"339566064_Weld_Defect_Extraction_and_Classification_in_Radiographic_Testing_Based_Artificial_Neural_Networks","abstract":"This paper contains two parts: In the first part, we show the effectiveness of using neural paradigms to detect edges in X-Ray images which are used in Non Destructive Testing. The developed classifier consisted of a multilayer feed forward network window in which the center pixel was classified using gray scale information within the window. The aim of the work in the second part, is to construct a set of weld defect descriptors in X-ray images and their recognition by the neural classifier. These descriptors are based on the geometric invariant moments which are insensitive regarding usual geometrical transformations. Once the geometric invariant features computed, a neural network classifier trained by back-propagation has to classify the defect-images in planer or volumetric defect classes.\nKey words: X-Ray images, Weld defects, Artificial Neural networks, Edge detection, Invariant moments.","authors":["Nafaa Nacereddine","Redouane Drai","Amar Benchaala"],"meta":["October 2000","Conference: 15th World Conference on Nondestructive TestingAt: Roma, Italy","Project: Image segmentation"],"references":["3301898_Back-propagation_network_and_its_configuration_for_blood_vessel_detection_in_angiograms","283921280_Visual_Pattern_Recognition_by_Moment_Invariants"]}
