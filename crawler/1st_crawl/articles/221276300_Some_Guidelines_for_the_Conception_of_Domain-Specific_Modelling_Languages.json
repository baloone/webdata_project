{"id":"221276300_Some_Guidelines_for_the_Conception_of_Domain-Specific_Modelling_Languages","abstract":"While the potential prospects of domain-specific modelling languages (DSML) are undisputed, the design of a DSML faces specific challenges that have raised only little attention so far. They relate to the boundaries between a DSML and corresponding models as well as to the question how specific a DSML should be. Addressing these challenges does not only contribute to the development of meta modelling methods, it also relates to judging the economics of a DSML. This paper suggests guidelines to support typical decisions that occur with the design of a DSML. They mainly concern the level of abstraction a potential language concept should be defined on. The guidelines are not intended to serve as recipes for design, but rather to improve the transparency of design decisions.","authors":["Ulrich Frank"],"meta":["January 2011","SourceDBLP","Conference: Enterprise Modelling and Information Systems Architectures: Proceedings of the 4th International Workshop on Enterprise Modelling and Information Systems Architectures, EMISA 2011, Hamburg, Germany, September 22-23, 2011"],"references":["221584052_Partial_Evaluation_in_Meta_Modeling","3297079_Materialization_and_its_metaclass_implementation","227673775_Method_Engineering_Towards_Methods_as_Services","220278598_Power_Types"]}
