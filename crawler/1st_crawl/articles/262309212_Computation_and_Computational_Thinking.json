{"id":"262309212_Computation_and_Computational_Thinking","abstract":"We recommend using the term Computation in conjunction with a well-defined model of computation whose semantics is clear and\nwhich matches the problem being investigated. Computer science already has a number of useful clearly defined models of computation\nwhose behaviors and capabilities are well understood. We should use such models as part of any definition of the term computation.\nHowever, for new domains of investigation where there are no appropriate models it may be necessary to invent new formalisms\nto represent the systems under study.","authors":["Alfred V.
