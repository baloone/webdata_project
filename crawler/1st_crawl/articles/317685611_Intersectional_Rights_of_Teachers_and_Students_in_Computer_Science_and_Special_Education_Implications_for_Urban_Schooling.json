{"id":"317685611_Intersectional_Rights_of_Teachers_and_Students_in_Computer_Science_and_Special_Education_Implications_for_Urban_Schooling","abstract":"This article advocates for the intersectional rights of teachers and students of computer science (CS) and special education (SPE) in urban education. Using an intersectional nepantla lens, we propose that CS education be accessible to all SPE teachers and students with dis/abilities. We argue for a focus on social-emotional intersectional rights as crucial foundations for an equitable approach to teaching and learning in CS SPE. We end with implications for educational stakeholders and teacher education programs that open pathways for socioemotional and intersectional rights of underrepresented teachers and students of CS and SPE.","authors":["Cueponcaxochitl Dianna Moreno Sandoval","David I.
