{"id":"226130270_On_lower_bounds_for_read-k-times_branching_programs","abstract":"A syntactic read-k-times branching program has the restriction that no variable occurs more than k times on any path (whether or not consistent) of the branching program. We first extend the result in [31], to show that the \"n/2 clique only function\", which is easily seen to be computable by deterministic polynomial size read-twice programs, cannot be computed by nondeterministic polynomial size read-once programs, although its complement can be so computed. We then exhibit an explicit Boolean function f such that every nondeterministic syntactic read-k-times branching program for computing f has size exp {Mathematical expression}","authors":["Allan Borodin","A.
