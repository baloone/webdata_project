{"id":"256094159_Distributed_leader_selection_without_direct_inter-agent_communication","abstract":"This paper is an endeavour to address the problem of distributed leader selection in a formation\nof autonomous agents where the agents do not communicate directly via communication channels. The\nalgorithm that the agents use to select a leader relies on the agents observing each others’ behaviours.\nIt is shown that the proposed algorithm is terminated, on average, in ﬁnite number of step and results\nin the selection of a leader for the formation. Moreover, It is established that the algorithm has some\ncommon elements with an algorithm widely used in data networks, i.e. Slotted Aloha. The application\nof the algorithm to a formation controlled by a nonlinear control law is studied and some numerical\nexamples are presented to show the general performance of the algorithm.","authors":["Iman Shames","André Teixeira","Henrik Sandberg","Karl H.
