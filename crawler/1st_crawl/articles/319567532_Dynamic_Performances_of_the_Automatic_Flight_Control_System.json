{"id":"319567532_Dynamic_Performances_of_the_Automatic_Flight_Control_System","abstract":"This paper explains why the combination of programming codes represents a true engineering tool in aircraft systems investigating. Flight safety and flying quality are extremely important to modern aviation industry. The aircraft responses, which are measured during real flight, are compared to the responses that are obtained from the simulations. Typically, aircraft problems consist in finding the solutions for basic work in all kind of areas, using knowledge from fields of science such as physics, mathematics and computer science. The purpose is to present such problems solved by computer simulations. Some of the advantages of performing numerical simulations are the low risk and low cost involved as compared to performing aircraft experiments. Another major advantage is the physical insight which one can gain in the behavior of the system subjected to different conditions and different values of the characteristic parameters of the aircraftâ€™s dynamic performances.","authors":["STROE Gabriela","Irina Carmen Andrei","Tiberiu Adrian Salaoru"],"meta":["September 2017INCAS BULLETIN 9(3):121-132","DOI:10.13111/2066-8201.2017.9.3.10","Project: Air Traffic Management"],"references":["281374146_An_Introduction_to_Control_Theory_Applications_with_Matlab","228510805_FDC_12_-_A_Simulink_Toolbox_for_Flight_Dynamics_and_Control_Analysis","258395321_Robust_Control_Toolbox","234801995_Aircraft_Dynamics_and_Automatic_Control","229091426_Automatic_Flight_Control_Systems","229091417_Dynamics_of_Flight-Stability_and_Control","3922803_Safety_critical_avionics_for_the_777_primary_flight_controls_system","3782118_Design_considerations_in_Boeing_777_fly-by-wire_computers"]}
