{"id":"333695450_A_Meta-Model-Based_Multi-Objective_Evolutionary_Approach_to_Robust_Job_Shop_Scheduling","abstract":"In the real-world manufacturing system, various uncertain events can occur and disrupt the normal production activities. This paper addresses the multi-objective job shop scheduling problem with random machine breakdowns. As the key of our approach, the robustness of a schedule is considered jointly with the makespan and is defined as expected makespan delay, for which a meta-model is designed by using a data-driven response surface method. Correspondingly, a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) is proposed based on the meta-model to solve the multi-objective optimization problem. Extensive experiments based on the job shop benchmark problems are conducted. The results demonstrate that the Pareto solution sets of the MOEA are much better in both convergence and diversity than those of the algorithms based on the existing slack-based surrogate measures. The MOEA is also compared with the algorithm based on Monte Carlo approximation, showing that their Pareto solution sets are close to each other while the MOEA is much more computationally efficient.","authors":["Wu","Yu","Li"],"meta":["June 2019","DOI:10.3390/math7060529"],"references":["345469304_Cooperative_Co-Evolution_Algorithm_with_an_MRF-Based_Decomposition_Strategy_for_Stochastic_Flexible_Job_Shop_Scheduling","332729775_Improved_Whale_Algorithm_for_Solving_the_Flexible_Job_Shop_Scheduling_Problem","332688479_The_Optimality_Region_for_a_Single-Machine_Scheduling_Problem_with_Bounded_Durations_of_the_Jobs_and_the_Total_Completion_Time_Objective","332363681_An_Efficient_Pareto_Approach_for_Solving_the_Multi-Objective_Flexible_Job-shop_Scheduling_Problem_with_Regular_Criteria","331988183_Two-Machine_Job-Shop_Scheduling_with_Equal_Processing_Times_on_Each_Machine","331880680_A_Decision_Support_System_for_Dynamic_Job-Shop_Scheduling_Using_Real-Time_Data_with_Simulation","331362150_Double-Layer_Cubature_Kalman_Filter_for_Nonlinear_Estimation","328051009_Two-stage_teaching-learning-based_optimization_method_for_flexible_job-shop_scheduling_under_machine_breakdown","328751418_A_Novel_Particle_Filter_Based_on_Hybrid_Deterministic_and_Random_Sampling","325481304_Risk_Measure_of_Job_Shop_Scheduling_with_Random_Machine_Breakdowns"]}
