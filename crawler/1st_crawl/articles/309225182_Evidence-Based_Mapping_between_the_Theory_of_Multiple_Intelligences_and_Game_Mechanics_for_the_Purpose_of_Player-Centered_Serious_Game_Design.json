{"id":"309225182_Evidence-Based_Mapping_between_the_Theory_of_Multiple_Intelligences_and_Game_Mechanics_for_the_Purpose_of_Player-Centered_Serious_Game_Design","abstract":"In the context of games for learning, it is argued that taking individual differences among players into consideration during game design can be beneficial for the game and/or learning experience. Researchers have studied a variety of factors that can be used for taking individual differences among players into consideration. Although research work indicates that the intelligence levels according to the theory of Multiple Intelligences may be a promising direction to follow, this direction is among the least explored ones. The research presented in this paper explores the applicability of the theory of Multiple Intelligences for personalized and player-centered (serious) game design using empirical evidence. Our results show that there is a correlation between gamers' intelligences, their preference for games, and game mechanics. To release the results to the game development community, a kind of recommendation system has been developed that provides information about appropriate and non-appropriated game mechanics for different intelligence dimensions.","authors":["Pejman Sajjadi","Joachim Vlieghe","Olga De Troyer"],"meta":["September 2016","DOI:10.1109/VS-GAMES.2016.7590348","Conference: 2016 8th International Conference on Games and Virtual Worlds for Serious Applications (VS-Games)"],"references":["302412604_Multiple_Intelligences_Profiling_Questionnaire","300275890_Dynamically_Adaptive_Educational_Games_A_New_Perspective","273947205_Games_without_frontiers_Theories_and_Methods_for_Game_Studies_and_Design","271891762_The_Study_on_the_Effect_of_Educational_Games_for_the_Development_of_Students'_Logic-Mathematics_of_Multiple_Intelligence","260254237_Cognitive_behavioral_game_design_A_unified_model_for_designing_serious_games","260105280_Pedagogy_in_Commercial_Video_Games","260042037_Adaptivity_in_Educational_Games_Including_Player_and_Gameplay_Characteristics","256109747_Visual_Attention_and_Gaze_Behavior_in_Games_An_Object-Based_Approach","256033706_Building_Customer_Relationship_through_Game_Mechanics_in_Social_Games","255061722_Multiple_Intelligences_the_Mozart_Effect_and_Emotional_Intelligence_A_Critical_Review","251860100_Dynamic_Player_Modelling_A_Framework_for_Player-centred_Digital_Games","249400133_Theory_of_Multiple_Intelligences_Is_It_a_Scientific_Theory","238608103_Inadequate_Evidence_for_Multiple_Intelligences_Mozart_Effect_and_Emotional_Intelligence_Theories","236168267_Gameplay_and_game_mechanics_design_a_key_to_quality_in_videogames","224236669_Adaptivity_Challenges_in_Games_and_Simulations_A_Survey","26519064_Identification_of_multiple_intelligences_with_the_Multiple_Intelligence_Profiling_Questionnaire_III","273946596_Defining_Game_Mechanics","268745264_Frames_of_Mind_The_Theory_of_Multiple_Intelligences","268362679_Using_Handheld_Gaming_Device_to_Increase_Multiple_Intelligences_with_Digital_Puzzle_Game","262365693_Effects_of_RPG_on_Middle_School_Players'_Intrapersonal_Intelligence","262214510_Using_mobile_console_games_for_multiple_intelligences_and_education","260981482_Develop_your_strengths_by_gaming_Towards_an_inventory_of_gamificationable_skills","259685995_Mapping_learning_and_game_mechanics_for_serious_games_analysis_Mapping_learning_and_game_mechanics","250308994_Game_Analytics_Maximizing_the_Value_of_Player_Data"]}
