{"id":"264741243_Mixed_m_problems_and_branch_and_bound_techniques","abstract":"The computation of the general structural singular value (μ) is NP hard, so quick solutions to medium sized problems must often be approximate. In many of the cases where the current approximate methods are unsatisfactory, improved solutions are highly desirable. It is shown that, despite their worst-case combinatorial nature, branch and bound techniques can give substantially improved solutions with only moderate computational cost. © 1997 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","authors":["Matthew P.
