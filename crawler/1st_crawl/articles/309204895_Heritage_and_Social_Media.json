{"id":"309204895_Heritage_and_Social_Media","abstract":"Heritage and Social Media explores how social media reframe our understanding and experience of heritage by opening up more participatory ways of interacting around heritage objects and concerns. Through the idea of participatory culture the book begins to explore how social media can be brought to bear on the encounter with heritage artifacts and settings and on the socially produced meanings and values that individuals and communities ascribe to them.","authors":["Elisa Giaccardi","graham fairclough","Neil Silberman","margaret purser"],"meta":["August 2012","Edition: 1 editionPublisher: RoutledgeEditor: Elisa GiaccardiISBN: 978-0415616676"],"references":["254005491_Heritage_matters_Designing_for_current_and_future_values_through_digital_and_social_technologies","248992595_Farming_the_heritage_On_the_production_and_construction_of_a_personal_and_practised_landscape_heritage","220382963_Understanding_fostering_and_supporting_cultures_of_participation","285727426_Is_everything_heritage","265092107_Confronting_the_Challenges_of_Participatory_Culture_-_Media_Education_for_the_21st_Century_Part_2","249033702_Stewarding_the_Future","237132422_Here_Comes_Everybody_The_Power_of_Organizing_without_Organizations","224927585_Everyware_The_dawning_age_of_ubiquitous_computing"]}
