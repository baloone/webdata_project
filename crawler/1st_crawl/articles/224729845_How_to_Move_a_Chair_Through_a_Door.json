{"id":"224729845_How_to_Move_a_Chair_Through_a_Door","abstract":"The door width of a simple polygon (a chair) is defined and an O(n^{2}) algorithm for computing its door width is given. It is first shown that all passages of the chair through the door can be reduced to a sequence of certain elementary motions. The technique of constraint analysis in characterizing elementary motions is introduced. Our algorithm actually constructs a motion of the chair through a door, and thus is a \"local expert\" for planning motion through doors. Such algorithms have applications in more general motion-planning systems in robotics.","authors":["Chee Keng Yap"],"meta":["July 1987IEEE Journal on Robotics and Automation 4(3):172 - 181","DOI:10.1109/JRA.1987.1087093","SourceIEEE Xplore"],"references":["291115821_Algorithmic_motion_planning","268244948_The_Width_of_a_Chair","262221021_New_algorithms_for_multilink_robot_arms","256604794_Computing_visibility_polygon_from_an_edge","242371575_Efficient_motion_planning_algorithms_in_environments_of_bounded_local_complexity","223218914_Constructing_the_Visibility_Graph_for_N-Line_Segments_in_ON2_Time","220224230_Visibility_of_Disjoint_Polygons","220114752_The_Power_of_Geometric_Duality_Revisited","4355308_On_the_Movement_of_Robot_Arms_in_2-Dimensional_Bounded_Regions"]}
