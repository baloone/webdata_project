{"id":"281461868_Minimizing_regular_criteria_in_the_flexible_job-shop_scheduling_problem","abstract":"Algorithms for minimizing other regular criteria than the makespan in the Flexible Job-shop Scheduling Problem (FJSP) are really scarce. In this paper, we propose a local search algorithm to optimize any regular criterion in the FJSP, which makes use of the disjunctive graph model to represent schedules and search for an optimal solution. Two neighborhood structures are proposed based on moving critical operations. Efficient conditions for testing the feasibility of moves are presented and new move evaluation functions are proposed. The efficiency of the algorithm is shown on instances of the classical job-shop scheduling problem with total weighted tardiness, as well as on instances of the FJSP with various regular criteria.","authors":["Andrés Alberto García-León","Stéphane Dauzère-Pérès","Yazid Mati"],"meta":["August 2015","Conference: 7th Multidisciplinary International Scheduling Conference : Theory & ApplicationsAt: Prague, Czech Republic","Project: Innovative solutions for the Flexible Job-shop Scheduling Problem"],"references":[]}
