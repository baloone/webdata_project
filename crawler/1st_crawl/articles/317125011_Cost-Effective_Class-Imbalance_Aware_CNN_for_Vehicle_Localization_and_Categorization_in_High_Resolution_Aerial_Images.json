{"id":"317125011_Cost-Effective_Class-Imbalance_Aware_CNN_for_Vehicle_Localization_and_Categorization_in_High_Resolution_Aerial_Images","abstract":"Joint vehicle localization and categorization in high resolution aerial images can provide useful information for applications such as traffic flow structure analysis. To maintain sufficient features to recognize small-scaled vehicles, a regions with convolutional neural network features (R-CNN) -like detection structure is employed. In this setting, cascaded localization error can be averted by equally treating the negatives and differently typed positives as a multi-class classification task, but the problem of class-imbalance remains. To address this issue, a cost-effective network extension scheme is proposed. In it, the correlated convolution and connection costs during extension are reduced by feature map selection and bi-partite main-side network construction, which are realized with the assistance of a novel feature map class-importance measurement and a new class-imbalance sensitive main-side loss function. By using an image classification dataset established from a set of traditional real-colored aerial images with 0.13 m ground sampling distance which are taken from the height of 1000 m by an imaging system composed of non-metric cameras, the effectiveness of the proposed network extension is verified by comparing with its similarly shaped strong counter-parts. Experiments show an equivalent or better performance, while requiring the least parameter and memory overheads are required.","authors":["Feimo Li","Shuxiao Li","Chengfei Zhu","Xiaosong Lan"],"meta":["May 2017Remote Sensing 9(6):494","DOI:10.3390/rs9050494"],"references":["319770123_Densely_Connected_Convolutional_Networks","313593125_Vehicle_Detection_in_Aerial_Images_Based_on_Region_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_and_Hard_Negative_Example_Mining","319770430_Rich_feature_hierarchies_for_accurate_object_detection_and_semantic_segmentation","319770291_Very_Deep_Convolutional_Networks_for_Large-Scale_Image_Recognition","319770183_Imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","319769911_Faster_R-CNN_Towards_Real-Time_Object_Detection_with_Region_Proposal_Networks","313601183_Optimal_brain_damage_in","311611062_Inside-Outside_Net_Detecting_Objects_in_Context_with_Skip_Pooling_and_Recurrent_Neural_Networks","311609981_RIFD-CNN_Rotation-Invariant_and_Fisher_Discriminative_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_Object_Detection","311609522_You_Only_Look_Once_Unified_Real-Time_Object_Detection","310500573_Vehicle_detection_from_high-resolution_aerial_images_using_spatial_pyramid_pooling-based_deep_convolutional_neural_networks","311609396_Deep_Metric_Learning_via_Lifted_Structured_Feature_Embedding","311609137_Learning_Deep_Representation_for_Imbalanced_Classification","311609041_Deep_Residual_Learning_for_Image_Recognition","310752533_Visualizing_and_understanding_convolutional_networks"]}
