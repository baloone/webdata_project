{"id":"317831112_Experiment_and_simulation_of_two-axle_bending_of_301_stainless_steel_strip_with_different_hardness_values","abstract":"Based on tensile test of strips with different hardness values and related parameters in the literature, the constitutive model of 301 stainless steel was established, the forming process of the two-axle bending was simulated by using the finite element analysis software ABAQUS, and the forming behaviors and forming force of the strips with different hardness values were obtained. According to the process parameters in the simulation, the experiments of the two-axle strip bending with different hardness values and extrusion amounts were conducted, and a series of samples were got. MATLAB fitting procedure was used to identify the forming radius of the strips formed by the test and simulation. The results show that, with the increase of the strip hardness, the formed radius of the strip increases, while the forming force changes little. Therefore, the proper choice of the relatively low hardness of the strip is advantageous to the preparation of the split sleeve. Â© 2017, Editorial Board of Journal of Plasticity Engineering.
