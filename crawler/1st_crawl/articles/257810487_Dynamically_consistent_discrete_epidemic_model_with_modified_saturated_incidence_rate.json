{"id":"257810487_Dynamically_consistent_discrete_epidemic_model_with_modified_saturated_incidence_rate","abstract":"A nonstandard finite difference scheme is constructed to solve a SIR epidemic model with modified saturated incidence rate. The dynamical properties of the resulting discrete system are then analyzed. It is shown that the discrete system is dynamically consistent with the continuous model because it preserves essential properties of the considered model, such as positivity and boundedness of solutions, equilibrium points and their stability properties. These properties are confirmed by numerical simulations.","authors":["Agus Suryanto","Wuryansari Muharini","Isnani Darti","Indah Yanti"],"meta":["July 2013Computational and Applied Mathematics 32(2)","DOI:10.1007/s40314-013-0026-6","Project: Dynamically Consistent Numerical Discretization of Epidemic Models"],"references":["278020903_Stability_and_Bifurcation_of_a_Discrete_SIS_Epidemic_Model_with_Delay","267070288_Stability_analysis_in_a_delayed_SIR_epidemic_model_with_a_saturated_incidence_rate","257590906_Stability_analysis_in_a_class_of_discrete_SIRS_epidemic_models","235771790_A_Dynamically_Consistent_Nonstandard_Numerical_Scheme_for_Epidemic_Model_with_Saturated_Incidence_Rate","235771784_A_Nonstandard_Finite_Difference_Scheme_for_SIS_Epidemic_Model_with_Delay_Stability_and_Bifurcation_Analysis","232084998_Global_Stability_Analysis_of_SEIR_Model_with_Holling_Type_II_Incidence_Function","344473775_Applications_of_Nonstandard_Finite_Difference_Schemes","321620990_An_Introduction_to_Difference_Equations","266305457_An_introduction_to_difference_equations_2nd_ed","256282970_A_generalization_of_the_Kermack-McKendrick_deterministic_epidemic_model"]}
