{"id":"315380028_Benchmarking_the_Chase","abstract":"The chase is a family of algorithms used in a number of data management tasks, such as data exchange, answering queries under dependencies, query reformulation with constraints, and data cleaning. It is well established as a theoretical tool for understanding these tasks, and in addition a number of prototype systems have been developed. While individual chase-based systems and particular optimizations of the chase have been experimentally evaluated in the past, we provide the first comprehensive and publicly available benchmark---test infrastructure and a set of test scenarios---for evaluating chase implementations across a wide range of assumptions about the dependencies and the data. We used our benchmark to compare chase-based systems on data exchange and query answering tasks with one another, as well as with systems that can solve similar tasks developed in closely related communities. Our evaluation provided us with a number of new insights concerning the factors that impact the performance of chase implementations.","authors":["Michael Benedikt","George Konstantinidis","Giansalvatore Mecca","Boris Motik"],"meta":["May 2017","DOI:10.1145/3034786.3034796","Conference: Proc. of 36th ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGAI Symposium on Principles of Database Systems (PODS 2017))","Project: The Llunatic Project"],"references":["315379943_That's_All_Folks_Llunatic_Goes_Open_Source","305446011_The_iBench_integration_metadata_generator","289382034_The_iBench_Integration_Metadata_Generator","286031338_Parallel_materialisation_of_datalog_programs_in_centralised_main-memory_RDF_systems","269306315_Mapping_and_cleaning","267246049_Efficiently_Computable_Datalog_Programs","234831120_The_DLV_System_for_Knowledge_Representation_and_Reasoning","225170746_System_Description_E_081","225035500_Foundations_of_Databases","221559652_The_chase_revisited","220538508_DEMo_Data_exchange_modeling_tool","220538371_Scalable_Data_Exchange_with_Functional_Dependencies","200034356_Query_Reformulation_with_Constraints","24163925_Laconic_schema_mappings_computing_core_universal_solutions_by_means_of_SQL_queries","2922471_Data_Exchange_Getting_to_the_Core","2490262_ToXgene_A_template-based_data_generator_for_XML","314830264_ToXgene_a_template-based_data_generator_for_XML","305081646_Functional_Dependencies_Unleashed_for_Scalable_Data_Exchange","289921078_PDQ_Proof-driven_query_answering_over_web-based_data","286800347_Optimizing_the_chase_Scalable_data_integration_under_constraints","282066120_Graal_A_Toolkit_for_Query_Answering_with_Existential_Rules","276465265_Querying_with_access_patterns_and_integrity_constraints","276465158_PDQ","275575027_STBenchmark","274343743_Laconic_schema_mappings","271131716_The_Description_Logic_Handbook_Theory_Implementation_and_Applications","262572167_The_backchase_revisited","262323522_Acyclicity_Notions_for_Existential_Rules_and_Their_Application_to_Query_Answering_in_Ontologies","257158040_Core_schema_mappings_Scalable_core_computations_in_data_exchange","234826819_Term_Indexing","222830276_LUBM_a_benchmark_for_OWL_knowledge_base_systems","222489323_On_the_power_of_magic","221559638_Generalized_Schema-Mappings_From_Termination_To_Tractability","220693831_Term_Rewriting_and_All_That","220642814_Enhancing_DLV_instantiator_by_backjumping_techniques","220538641_STBenchmark_Towards_a_benchmark_for_mapping_systems","220503370_Computing_certain_answers_in_the_presence_of_dependencies","220430961_Efficient_core_computation_in_data_exchange","220225292_Testing_Implications_of_Data_Dependencies","2566500_Data_Exchange_Semantics_and_Query_Answering","2388521_Paramodulation-Based_Theorem_Proving"]}
