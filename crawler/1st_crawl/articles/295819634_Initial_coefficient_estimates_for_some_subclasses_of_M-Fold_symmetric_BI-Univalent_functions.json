{"id":"295819634_Initial_coefficient_estimates_for_some_subclasses_of_M-Fold_symmetric_BI-Univalent_functions","abstract":"In the present investigation, we consider two new general subclasses B-Sigma m(tau, lambda; alpha) and B*(Sigma m)(iota, lambda; beta) of Sigma(m) consisting of analytic and m-fold symmetric bi-univalent functions in the open unit disk U. For functions belonging to the two classes introduced here, we derive non-sharp estimates on the initial coefficients vertical bar a(m+1)vertical bar and vertical bar a(2m+1)vertical bar. Several connections to some of the earlier known results are also pointed out.","authors":["Hari Mohan Srivastava","Sebastien Gaboury","Firas Ghanim"],"meta":["May 2016Acta Mathematica Scientia 36B(3):1-9","DOI:10.1016/S0252-9602(16)30045-5"],"references":["276235439_Initial_coefficient_bounds_for_a_subclass_of_m_-_Fold_symmetric_bi-univalent_functions","275041948_Some_further_properties_of_a_linear_operator_associated_with_the_-generalized_Hurwitz-Lerch_zeta_function_related_to_the_class_of_meromorphically_univalent_functions","266599267_Two_new_subclasses_of_bi-univalent_functions","243063963_Coefficients_of_Symmetric_Functions_of_Bounded_Boundary_Rotation","220318334_New_subclasses_of_bi-univalent_functions","220318170_Certain_subclasses_of_analytic_and_bi-univalent_functions","311987971_Coefficient_estimates_for_some_general_subclasses_of_analytic_and_bi-univalent_functions","303137609_Initial_coefficient_estimates_for_bi-lambda-convex_and_bi-mu-starlike_functions_connected_with_arithmetic_and_geometric_means","285392015_Petroleum-Based_Fuels_-_An_Outlook","267183193_The_coefficient_estimates_for_bi-univalent_functions","266860526_Coefficient_bounds_for_bi-univalent_functions","266049714_On_some_classes_of_bi-univalent_functions","265109585_On_a_Coefficient_Problem_for_Bi-Univalent_Functions","257293990_Coefficient_estimates_for_a_certain_subclass_of_analytic_and_bi-univalent_functions","256936630_A_certain_general_subclass_of_analytic_and_bi-univalent_functions_and_associated_coefficient_estimate_problems","248238406_Untersuchungen_lou_uber_schlichte_konforme_Abbildungen_des_Einheitkreises","238869087_Results_on_BI-univalent_Functions","226471047_Untersuchungen_uber_schlichte_konforme_Abbildungen_des_Einheitskreises_I","38322882_On_the_coefficients_of_close-to-convex_functions"]}
