{"id":"252035567_Special_convergence_analysis_of_Quasi-Wilson_element","abstract":"The new convergence analysis of Quasi-Wilson element for the second-order problems is presented in this paper. it is shown that the consistency error of Quasi-Wilson element can reach to O(h 3 ) order on rectangular meshes, two order higher than that of the famous Wilson element and one order higher than that of the known result on arbitrary quadrilateral meshes, which further improves the results of previous literature.
