{"id":"295252060_Towards_a_leading_role_on_climate_services_in_Europe_A_research_and_innovation_roadmap","abstract":"The European Commission established an ad hoc Expert Group to develop a framework for action towards growing a strong and flourishing climate service sector across Europe. The growth of this sector is seen as essential to meeting the challenges associated with building resilience and sustainability across Europe and in member states, and for enhancing their capacities to deliver climate services in a global market. The resulting research and innovation roadmap articulates an agenda and shared approach that are based on building on enhancing existing investments, focusing on solution-oriented activities and specific actions that are using Horizon 2020 (and other funding programmes) as a bridge between users and the science. This short communication provides a personal overview by one of the members of the Expert Group on the thinking that guided the development of the Roadmap for climate services and provides insights on how it is being taken forward.","authors":["Roger B.
