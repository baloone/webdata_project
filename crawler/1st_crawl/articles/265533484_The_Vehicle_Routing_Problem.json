{"id":"265533484_The_Vehicle_Routing_Problem","abstract":"The Vehicle Routing Problem covers both exact and heuristic methods developed for the VRP and some of its main variants, emphasizing the practical issues common to VRP. The book is composed of three parts containing contributions from well-known experts. The first part covers basic VRP, known more commonly as capacitated VRP. The second part covers three main variants of VRP with time windows, backhauls, and pickup and delivery. The third part covers issues arising in real-world VRP applications and includes both case studies and references to software packages. The book will be of interest to both researchers and graduate-level students in the communities of operations research and matematical sciences. It focuses on a specific family of problems while offering a complete overview of the effective use of the most important techniques proposed for the solution of hard combinatorial problems. Practitioners will find this book particularly usef","authors":["Nicos Christofides","Aristide Mingozzi","Paolo Toth"],"meta":["January 1979","DOI:10.1051/ro/197610V100551"],"references":["344568673_A_COMPARATIVE_STUDY_OF_NONLINEAR_PROGRAMMING_CODES","268857350_Une_methode_de_resolution_des_programmes_non-lineaire_partiellement_discrets_sans_hypothese_de_convexite","266695261_Une_methode_arborescente_pour_les_programmes_non-lineaires_partiellement_discrets","246839192_Mixed_Integer_Programming_by_a_Branch-and-Bound_Technique","242530295_Branch-and-bound_methods_for_integer_and_non-convex_programming","242396533_An_Algorithm_for_the_Traveling_Salesman_Problem","234827609_Construction_of_Nonlinear_Programming_Test_Problems","227443004_An_Algorithm_for_the_Solution_of_Mixed_Integer_Programming_Problems","200622042_An_Automatic_Method_of_Solving_Discrete_Linear_Programming_Problems","200621953_A_Tree-Search_Algorithm_for_Mixed_Integer_Programming_Problems"]}
