{"id":"225330670_Exact_and_Parameterized_Algorithms_for_Max_Internal_Spanning_Tree","abstract":"We consider the NP\\mathcal{NP}-hard problem of finding a spanning tree with a maximum number of internal vertices. This problem is a generalization of the\nfamous Hamiltonian Path problem. Our dynamic-programming algorithms for general and degree-bounded graphs have running times of the form O*(cn)\\mathcal{O}^{*}(c^{n}) with c≤2. For graphs with bounded degree, c<2. The main result, however, is a branching algorithm for graphs with maximum degree three. It only needs polynomial space\nand has a running time of O(1.8612n)\\mathcal{O}(1.8612^{n}) when analyzed with respect to the number of vertices. We also show that its running time is 2.1364k nO(1)2.1364^{k} n^{\\mathcal{O}(1)} when the goal is to find a spanning tree with at least k internal vertices. Both running time bounds are obtained via a Measure & Conquer analysis, the latter one being a novel use\nof this kind of analysis for parameterized algorithms.\n\nKeywordsExact exponential-time algorithms–Measure and conquer–Parameterized algorithms–Spanning tree problems–Maximum internal spanning trees","authors":["Daniel Binkele-Raible","Henning Fernau","Serge Gaspers","Mathieu Liedloff"],"meta":["December 2009Algorithmica 65(1):1-34","DOI:10.1007/s00453-011-9575-5"],"references":["277288278_SYSTEMATIC_KERNELIZATION_IN_FPT_ALGORITHM_DESIGN","234783951_A_generating_function_approach_to_the_Traveling_Salesman_Problem","228741795_Simplicity_is_beauty_Improved_upper_bounds_for_vertex_cover","227240975_Sharp_Separation_and_Applications_to_Exact_and_Parameterized_Algorithms","225634066_Solving_Connected_Dominating_Set_Faster_Than_2n","225340845_Solving_Connected_Dominating_Set_Faster_Than_2n","225155793_Spanning_Trees_A_Survey","221590355_Saving_space_by_algebraization","221563856_Towards_Fully_Multivariate_Algorithmics_Some_New_Results_and_Directions_in_Parameter_Ecology","221219858_EitherOr_Using_Vertex_Cover_Structure_in_Designing_FPT-Algorithms_-_The_Case_of_k-Internal_Spanning_Tree","220992922_An_Exact_Algorithm_for_the_Maximum_Leaf_Spanning_Tree_Problem","220992898_InclusionExclusion_Branching_for_Partial_Dominating_Set_and_Set_Splitting","220897703_Fast_Polynomial-Space_Algorithms_Using_Mobius_Inversion_Improving_on_Steiner_Tree_and_Related_Problems","220673224_Reducing_to_Independent_Set_Structure_--_the_Case_of_k-Internal_Spanning_Tree","220430761_A_Measure_Conquer_Approach_for_the_Analysis_of_Exact_Algorithms","220224003_Sharp_Separation_and_Applications_to_Exact_and_Parameterized_Algorithms","316797733_Texts_in_Theoretical_Computer_Science_An_EATCS_Series","299256330_Improved_parameterized_upper_bounds_for_vertex_cover","283658312_Amortized_Analysis_of_Exponential_Time-_and_Parameterized_Algorithms_Measure_Conquer_and_Reference_Search_Trees","262369741_Exact_Exponential_Algorithms","259860850_A_Dynamic_Programming_Approach_to_Sequencing_Problems","252778757_Star-Disk_Interaction_in_Young_Stars","251696258_Breaking_the_n2_-barrier_for_Irredundance_Two_lines_of_attack","232347229_Dynamic_programming_meets_the_principle_of_inclusion_and_exclusion_1","225610222_An_Amortized_Search_Tree_Analysis_for_k-Leaf_Spanning_Tree","225169879_The_Traveling_Salesman_Problem_in_Bounded_Degree_Graphs","225113640_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","224206102_Determinant_Sums_for_Undirected_Hamiltonicity","223163235_An_exact_algorithm_for_the_maximum_leaf_spanning_tree_problem","222673286_Vertex_Cover_Further_Observations_and_Further_Improvements","222614617_Algorithms_for_Maximum_Independent_Sets","222497318_Reverse_search_for_enumeration","221590993_Fourier_meets_mobius_fast_subset_convolution","221426706_An_Improved_Exact_Algorithm_for_Cubic_Graph_TSP","221220070_Better_Approximation_Algorithms_for_the_Maximum_Internal_Spanning_Tree_Problem","220992954_Even_Faster_Algorithm_for_Set_Splitting","220992903_Enumerate_and_Measure_Improving_Parameter_Budget_Management","220976515_Approximation_Algorithms_for_the_Maximum_Internal_Spanning_Tree_Problem","220908379_A_Moderately_Exponential_Time_Algorithm_for_Full_Degree_Spanning_Tree","220752807_Exact_and_Parameterized_Algorithms_for_Max_Internal_Spanning_Tree","220689905_Exponential_Time_Algorithms_-_Structures_Measures_and_Bounds","220483504_Exact_Exponential_Time_Algorithms_for_Max_Internal_Spanning_Tree","220481684_Fourier_meets_Mobius_fast_subset_convolution","220430939_Dynamic_Programming_Treatment_of_the_Traveling_Salesman_Problem","220224258_On_the_Minimum_Feedback_Vertex_Set_Problem_Exact_and_Enumeration_Algorithms","220155539_Approximating_the_Maximum_Internal_Spanning_Tree_problem","220115880_On_finding_spanning_trees_with_few_leaves","220111307_Refined_memorization_for_vertex_cover","220081402_A_Survey_on_Algorithms_for_the_Maximum_Internal_Spanning_Tree_and_Related_Problems","216877586_On_Cliques_in_Graphs","50232045_Algorithm_for_Finding_k-Vertex_Out-trees_and_Its_Application_to_k-Internal_Out-branching_Problem","45883501_A_Faster_Exact_Algorithm_for_the_Directed_Maximum_Leaf_Spanning_Tree_Problem","45862954_A_Linear_Vertex_Kernel_for_Maximum_Internal_Spanning_Tree","45857659_A_Universally_Fastest_Algorithm_for_Max_2-Sat_Max_2-CSP_and_Everything_in_Between","1956322_The_Traveling_Salesman_Problem_for_Cubic_Graphs"]}
