{"id":"316770344_A_robust_and_secure_key-frames_based_video_watermarking_system_using_chaotic_encryption","abstract":"Currently we are facing a wide interest in multimedia security and copyright protection due to the explosion of data exchange in the Internet and the extensive use of digital media. In this paper, we propose a video watermarking method in which watermark information are encrypted using a new chaotic encryption, and then, embedded in the key-frames extracted from the video stream. Under this framework, a simple and fast key-frames extraction algorithm based on gradient magnitude similarity deviation (GMSD) is used. This algorithm can significantly decrease the complexity of video watermarking systems. In order to insert the watermark in a blind manner, new insertion and extraction functions are designed by means of a quantization process. A double transformation domain based on discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and singular value decomposition (SVD) is adopted to robustly embed the watermark with low visual distortion. Evaluation study is conducted to verify the performance through a series of experiments. The proposed system outperforms several recent algorithms found in the literature in terms of the robustness and imperceptibility under potential attacks. Furthermore, the security requirement of the proposed algorithm is achieved with the proposed chaotic encryption procedure.","authors":["Yassine Himeur","Abdelkrim Boukabou"],"meta":["April 2018Multimedia Tools and Applications 77(6)","DOI:10.1007/s11042-017-4754-2"],"references":["299132812_Dual-Level_Security_based_Cyclic18_Steganographic_Method_and_its_Application_for_Secure_Transmission_of_Keyframes_during_Wireless_Capsule_Endoscopy","287817063_Joint_Color_and_Texture_Descriptor_Using_Ring_Decomposition_for_Robust_Video_Copy_Detection_in_Large_Databases","281576050_A_robust_color_video_watermarking_scheme_based_on_hybrid_embedding_techniques","278148701_Adaptive_video_watermarking_integrating_a_fuzzy_wavelet-based_human_visual_system_perceptual_model","277249684_A_Novel_Magic_LSB_Substitution_Method_M-LSB-SM_using_Multi-Level_Encryption_and_Achromatic_Component_of_an_Image","289983310_Image_encryption_using_2D_Logistic-adjusted-Sine_map","285194328_Steganography","285043123_A_chaos-based_image_encryption_algorithm_with_simple_logical_functions","278683546_Digital_image_watermarking_using_partial_pivoting_lower_and_upper_triangular_decomposition_into_the_wavelet_domain","277917301_A_novel_image_encryption_algorithm_based_on_chaos_and_Line_map","274835064_A_fast_and_robust_key-frames_based_video_copy_detection_using_BSIF-RMI","275719263_A_new_robust_digital_watermarking_using_local_polar_harmonic_transform","274893390_Secure_and_robust_audio_watermarking_system_for_copyright_protection","273286242_Object_based_watermarking_for_H264AVC_video_resistant_to_rst_attacks","271920498_Adaptively_imperceptible_video_watermarking_based_on_the_local_motion_entropy"]}
