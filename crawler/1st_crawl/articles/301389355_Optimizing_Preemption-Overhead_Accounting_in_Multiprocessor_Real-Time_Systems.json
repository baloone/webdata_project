{"id":"301389355_Optimizing_Preemption-Overhead_Accounting_in_Multiprocessor_Real-Time_Systems","abstract":"There exist two general techniques to account for preemption-related overheads on multiprocessors. This paper presents a new preemption-related overhead-accounting technique, called analytical redistribution of preemption overheads (ARPO), which integrates the two previous techniques to minimize preemption-overhead-related utilization loss. ARPO is applicable under any job-level fixed priority (JLFP) preemptive scheduler, as well as some limited-preemption schedulers. ARPO is evaluated in a new experimental-design framework for overhead-aware schedulability studies that addresses unrealistic simplifying assumptions made in previous studies, and is shown to improve real-time schedulability.","authors":["Bryan C.
