Overall, 793 retrospectively acquired posterior–anterior (PA) chest X-ray images (CXRs) of 793 patients were used to train deep learning (DL) models for lung and heart segmentation. The training dataset included PA CXRs from two public datasets and in-house PA CXRs. Two fully automated segmentation-based methods using state-of-the-art DL models for lung and heart segmentation were developed. The diagnostic performance was assessed and the reliability of the automatic cardiothoracic ratio (CTR) calculation was determined using the mean absolute error and paired t-test. The effects of thoracic pathological conditions on performance were assessed using subgroup analysis. One thousand PA CXRs of 1000 patients (480 men, 520 women; mean age 63 ± 23 years) were included. The CTR values derived from the DL models and diagnostic performance exhibited excellent agreement with reference standards for the whole test dataset. Performance of segmentation-based methods differed based on thoracic conditions. When tested using CXRs with lesions obscuring heart borders, the performance was lower than that for other thoracic pathological findings. Thus, segmentation-based methods using DL could detect cardiomegaly; however, the feasibility of computer-aided detection of cardiomegaly without human intervention was limited.","authors":["Mu Sook Lee","Yong Soo Kim","Minki Kim","Muhammad Usman"],"meta":["August 2021Scientific Reports 11(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-021-96433-1"],"references":["352199235_Cardiothoracic_ratio_measurement_using_artificial_intelligence_observer_and_method_validation_studies","348384092_Automatic_Lung_Segmentation_on_Chest_X-rays_Using_Self-Attention_Deep_Neural_Network","341497067_Cardiomegaly_Detection_on_Chest_Radiographs_Segmentation_Versus_Classification","340115503_Artificial_Intelligence-Based_Diagnosis_of_Cardiac_and_Related_Diseases","330935962_A_review_on_lung_boundary_detection_in_chest_X-rays_rule-based_to_data-driven_approaches","328800804_Deep_Learning_for_Grading_Cardiomegaly_Severity_in_Chest_X-Rays_An_Investigation","339064183_Bayesian_Feature_Pyramid_Networks_for_Automatic_Multi-label_Segmentation_of_Chest_X-rays_and_Assessment_of_Cardio-Thoratic_Ratio","335915054_ChestX-ray_Hospital-Scale_Chest_X-ray_Database_and_Benchmarks_on_Weakly_Supervised_Classification_and_Localization_of_Common_Thorax_Diseases","332062855_Automatic_Cardiothoracic_Ratio_Calculation_With_Deep_Learning","328986712_CardioXNet_Automated_Detection_for_Cardiomegaly_Based_on_Deep_Learning","328088383_Deep_learning_in_chest_radiography_Detection_of_findings_and_presence_of_change","316740882_ChestX-Ray8_Hospital-Scale_Chest_X-Ray_Database_and_Benchmarks_on_Weakly-Supervised_Classification_and_Localization_of_Common_Thorax_Diseases","321217865_Abnormality_Detection_and_Localization_in_Chest_X-Rays_using_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","311609041_Deep_Residual_Learning_for_Image_Recognition","286512696_Deep_Residual_Learning_for_Image_Recognition"]}
