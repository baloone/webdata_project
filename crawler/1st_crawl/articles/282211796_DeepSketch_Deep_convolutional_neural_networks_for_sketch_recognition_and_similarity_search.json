{"id":"282211796_DeepSketch_Deep_convolutional_neural_networks_for_sketch_recognition_and_similarity_search","abstract":"In this paper, we present a system for sketch classification and similarity search. We used deep convolution neural networks (ConvNets), state of the art in the field of image recognition. They enable both classification and medium/highlevel features extraction. We make use of ConvNets features as a basis for similarity search using k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN). Evaluation are performed on the TU-Berlin benchmark. Our main contributions are threefold: first, we use ConvNets in contrast to most previous approaches based essentially on hand crafted features. Secondly, we propose a ConvNet that is both more accurate and lighter/faster than the two only previous attempts at making use of ConvNets for handsketch recognition. We reached an accuracy of 75.42%. Third, we shown that similarly to their application on natural images, ConvNets allow the extraction of medium-level and high-level features (depending on the depth) which can be used for similarity search.1","authors":["Omar Seddati","Stéphane Dupont","Mahmoudi Saïd"],"meta":["June 2015","DOI:10.1109/CBMI.2015.7153606","Conference: Content-Based Multimedia Indexing (CBMI), 2015 13th International Workshop on"],"references":["278242900_Sketch_Classification_and_Classification-driven_Analysis_Using_Fisher_Vectors","271771397_Freehand_Sketch_Recognition_Using_Deep_Features","271710355_Deep_Neural_Networks_for_Sketch_Recognition","265787949_Going_Deeper_with_Convolutions","319770411_Torch7_A_Matlab-like_Environment_for_Machine_Learning","314779249_How_do_humans_sketch_objects","289751479_MathPad2_A_system_for_the_creation_and_exploration_of_mathematical_sketches","269250098_Sketch_Recognition_by_Ensemble_Matching_of_Structured_Features","267960550_ImageNet_Classification_with_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","264890087_Torch7_A_Matlab-like_Environment_for_Machine_Learning"]}
