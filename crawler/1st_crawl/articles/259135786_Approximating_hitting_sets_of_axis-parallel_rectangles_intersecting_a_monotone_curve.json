{"id":"259135786_Approximating_hitting_sets_of_axis-parallel_rectangles_intersecting_a_monotone_curve","abstract":"In this note, we present a simple combinatorial factor 6 algorithm for approximating the minimum hitting set of a family R={R1,…,Rn}R={R1,…,Rn} of axis-parallel rectangles in the plane such that there exists an axis-monotone curve γ that intersects each rectangle in the family. The quality of the hitting set is shown by comparing it to the size of a packing (set of pairwise non-intersecting rectangles) that is constructed along, hence, we also obtain a factor 6 approximation for the maximum packing of RR.\nIn cases where the axis-monotone curve γ intersects the same side (e.g. the bottom side) of each rectangle in the family the approximation factor for hitting set and packing is 3.","authors":["Victor Chepoi","Stefan Felsner"],"meta":["November 2013Computational Geometry 46(9):1036–1041","DOI:10.1016/j.comgeo.2013.05.008"],"references":["225581441_Almost_Optimal_Set_Covers_in_Finite_VC-Dimension","222668936_Fast_Stabbing_of_Boxes_in_High_Dimensions","281084642_Max_Point-Tolerance_Graphs","265435621_Algorithm_Graph_Theory_and_Perfect_Graphs","256158000_Covering_boxes_by_points","244521760_Uber_eine_kombinatorisch-geometrische_Frage_von_Hadwiger_und_Debrunner","226510260_Intersection_Graphs_of_Rectangles_and_Segments","225519270_On_point_covers_of_parallel_rectangles","222644085_Polynomial-time_approximation_schemes_for_packing_and_piercing_fat_objects","221957051_Covering_and_coloring_problems_for_relatives_of_intervals"]}
