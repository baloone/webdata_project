{"id":"247328810_Fear_of_failure_2_2_achievement_goal_and_self-handicapping_An_examination_of_the_hierarchical_model_of_achievement_motivation_in_physical_education","abstract":"In this study, the hierarchical model of achievement motivation [Elliot, A. J. (1997). Integrating the “classic” and “contemporary” approaches to achievement motivation: A hierarchical model of approach and avoidance achievement motivation. In P. Pintrich & M. Maehr (Eds.), Advances in motivation and achievement (Vol. 10, pp. 143–179). Greenwich, CT: JAI Press] is used to investigate the motivational mechanism behind the relationship between fear of failure and self-handicapping adoption. A cross-sectional design was employed. The participants were 691 college students enrolled in physical education in Taiwan. Students completed the Performance Failure Appraisal Inventory (PEAI-S; Conroy, D. E., Willow, J. P., & Metzler, J. N. (2002). Multidimensional measurement of fear of failure: The performance failure appraisal inventory. Journal of Applied Sport Psychology, 14, 76–90), the Chinese 2×2 Achievement Goal Questionnaire for Physical Education (CAGQ-PE; Chen, L. H. (2007). Construct validity of Chinese 2×2 achievement goal questionnaire in physical education: Evidence from collectivistic culture. Paper presented at the 5th conference of the Asian South Pacific Association of Sport Psychology. Bangkok, Thailand) and the Self-Handicapping Scale (SHS; Wu, C. H., Wang, C. H., & Lin, Y. C. (2004). The exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis of self-handicap scale for sport. Journal of Higher Education in Physical Education, 6(1), 139–148). Structural equation modeling was conducted. Generally, the results showed that mastery-avoidance and performance-avoidance goals partially mediated the relationship between fear of failure and self-handicapping. The results are discussed in terms of the hierarchical model of achievement motivation, and its implications for physical education are also highlighted.","authors":["Lung Hung Chen","Chiahuei Wu","Ying Hwa Kee","Meng-Shyan Lin"],"meta":["October 2009Contemporary Educational Psychology 34(4):298-305","DOI:10.1016/j.cedpsych.2009.06.006"],"references":["312447691_Rethinking_construct_reliability_within_latent_variable_systems","291601648_The_exploratory_and_confirmatory_factor_analysis_of_'Self_handicap_scale_for_sports'","238865161_Factorial_Invariance_and_Latent_Mean_Stability_of_Performance_Failure_Appraisals","233243094_Self-Handicapping_Related_to_Task_and_Performance-Approach_and_Avoidance_Goals_in_Physical_Education","232536661_Achievement_Goals_Self-Handicapping_and_Performance_Attainment_A_Mediational_Analysis","232435914_A_2_2_Achievement_Goals_Questionnaire_for_Sport_Evidence_for_Factorial_Invariance_Temporal_Stability_and_External_Validity","223549921_Antecedents_and_consequences_of_approach_and_avoidance_achievement_goals_A_test_of_gender_invariance","30845213_Academic_Self-Handicapping_What_We_Know_What_More_There_is_to_Learn","12741494_Is_There_a_Universal_Need_for_Positive_Self-Regard","325676797_Drug_choice_as_a_self-handicapping_strategy_in_response_to_noncontingent_success","313163630_Self-handicapping","313100664_Conceptions_of_ability_and_achievement_motivation","306154013_Conceptions_of_ability_and_achievement_motivation","288874650_Rethinking_construct_reliability_within_latent_variable_systems","287818956_The_role_of_dispositional_goal_orientation_and_team_climate_on_situational_self-handicapping_among_young_athletes","279558447_The_Unique_Psychological_Meanings_of_Multidimensional_Fears_of_Failing","264471465_Individualism_and_Collectivism_What_Do_They_Have_to_Do_With_Counseling","247515108_Multidimensional_Fear_of_Failure_Measurement_The_Performance_Failure_Appraisal_Inventory","247434297_A_2_2_achievement_goal_framework","247204764_Development_and_validation_of_the_Achievement_Goal_Scale_for_Youth_Sports","247133803_Performance-approach_goals_Good_for_what_for_whom_under_what_circumstances_and_at_what_cost","245458456_Approach_and_Avoidance_Motivation_and_Achievement_Goals","243666006_Temporal_Stability_of_Performance_Failure_Appraisal_Inventory_Items","234021391_Back-Translation_for_Cross-Cultural_Research","233896647_The_Competitive_Ethos_and_Democratic_Education","233896217_Integrating_the_classic_and_the_contemporary_approaches_to_achievement_motivation_A_hierarchical_model_of_approach_and_avoidance_motivation","232596180_Classrooms_Goals_Structures_and_Student_Motivation","232595363_Achievement_Goals_in_the_Classroom_Students'_Learning_Strategies_and_Motivation_Processes","232590069_A_Hierarchical_Model_of_Approach_and_Avoidance_Achievement_Motivation","232587202_Defensive_Strategies_Motivation_and_the_Self_A_Self-Regulatory_Process_View","232499086_Perceived_Achievement_Goal_Structure_and_College_Student_Help_Seeking","232498280_The_2_2_Achievement_Goal_Framework_An_Overview_of_Empirical_Research","232486340_Performance-approach_goals_Good_for_what_for_whom_under_with_circumstances_and_at_what_cost","232468422_Differences_in_the_Motivational_Beliefs_of_Asian_American_and_Non-Asian_Students","232438262_Self-handicappers_Individual_differences_in_the_preference_for_anticipatory_self-protective_acts","230515976_Understanding_the_Dynamics_of_Motivation_in_Sport_and_Physical_Activity_An_Achievement_Goal_Interpretation","228738891_Fear_of_failure_and_achievement_goals_in_sport_Addressing_the_issue_of_the_chicken_and_the_egg","226135565_Achievement_Goals_and_the_Hierarchical_Model_of_Achievement_Motivation","225160665_The_Hierarchical_Model_of_Approach-Avoidance_Motivation","223439013_Self-handicapping_strategies_in_physical_education_classes_The_influence_of_implicit_theories_of_the_nature_of_ability_and_achievement_goal_orientations","222723009_Reducing_the_tendency_to_self-handicap_The_effect_of_self-affirmation","222278146_Seeking_help_in_large_college_classes_A_person-centered_approach","222006169_Current_issues_in_achievement_goal_theory_and_research","43501294_The_22_Achievement_Goal_Framework_in_a_Physical_Education_Context","23684153_Implicit_Theory_of_Athletic_Ability_and_Self-Handicapping_in_College_Students","22492694_Drug_choice_as_a_self-handicapping_strategy_in_response_to_success","12694620_An_Achievement_Goal_Theory_Perspective_on_Issues_in_Motivation_Terminology_Theory_and_Research","12167519_Academic_Self-Handicapping_and_Achievement_Goals_A_Further_Examination","12032920_A_22_Achievement_goal_framework","11597935_A_Cross-Cultural_Analysis_of_Avoidance_Relative_to_Approach_Personal_Goals","8451387_The_Intergenerational_Transmission_of_Fear_of_Failure","7131266_The_social-cognitive_model_of_achievement_motivation_and_the_2X2_achievement_framework","10747932_A_Motivational_Analysis_of_Defensive_Pessimism_and_Self-Handicapping","7989537_Costs_of_Self-Handicapping"]}
