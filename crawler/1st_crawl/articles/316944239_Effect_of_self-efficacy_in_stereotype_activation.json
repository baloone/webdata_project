{"id":"316944239_Effect_of_self-efficacy_in_stereotype_activation","abstract":"We examined whether or not self-efficacy plays a role in stereotype-activation effect. We found in Study 1 (N = 46) that compared to being primed with the stereotype of an occupation that required less mental effort (cleaner), participants primed with the stereotype of a highly qualified information technology expert performed better in a general knowledge test. Self-efficacy reliably mediated the effect of stereotype activation on test performance. In Study 2 (N = 46) we found that the group primed with the stereotype of an athlete exhibited greater endurance in a physical test than did those who were primed with the stereotype of a homeless person. These results show that self-efficacy beliefs acted as a mediator in the behavior of the participants. Â© 2017 Scientific Journal Publishers Limited.
