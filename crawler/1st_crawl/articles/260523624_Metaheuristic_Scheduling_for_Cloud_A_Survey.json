{"id":"260523624_Metaheuristic_Scheduling_for_Cloud_A_Survey","abstract":"Cloud computing has become an increasingly important research topic given the strong evolution and migration of many network services to such computational environment. The problem that arises is related with efficiency management and utilization of the large amounts of computing resources. This paper begins with a brief retrospect of traditional scheduling, followed by a detailed review of metaheuristic algorithms for solving the scheduling problems by placing them in a unified framework. Armed with these two technologies, this paper surveys the most recent literature about metaheuristic scheduling solutions for cloud. In addition to applications using metaheuristics, some important issues and open questions are presented for the reference of future researches on scheduling for cloud.","authors":["Chun-Wei Tsai","Joel Rodrigues"],"meta":["March 2014IEEE Systems Journal 8(1):279-291","DOI:10.1109/JSYST.2013.2256731"],"references":["277474071_Tabu_search-part_II","271614546_Optimization_of_Cloud_Database_Route_Scheduling_Based_on_Combination_of_Genetic_Algorithm_and_Ant_Colony_Algorithm","270554188_Comparison_of_Workflow_Scheduling_Algorithms_in_Cloud_Computing","267012596_Ant_algorithm_for_grid_scheduling_powered_by_local_search","266422259_A_Synthetic_Heuristic_Algorithm_for_Independent_Task_Scheduling_in_Cloud_Systems","265873903_Applying_Non-Traditional_Optimization_Techniques_to_Task_Scheduling_In_Grid_Computing_-_An_Overview","259964319_To_Improve_Ant_Algorithm's_Grid_Scheduling_using_Local_Search","258385511_Energy-Efficient_Multi-Job_Scheduling_Model_for_Cloud_Computing_and_Its_Genetic_Algorithm","242090229_To_Improve_Ant_Algorithm's_Grid_Scheduling_Using_Local_Search","237144024_Scheduling_Jobs_on_Computational_Grids_Using_Fuzzy_Particle_Swarm_Optimization_Algorithm","235439153_Ant_sytem_Optimization_by_a_colony_of_cooperating_agents","233681438_Fifty_years_of_scheduling_A_survey_of_milestones","324336521_Scheduling_Computer_and_Manufacturing_Processes","313749844_Particle_swarm_optimization","313085310_Parameter_Selection_in_Particle_Swarm_Optimization","312907789_Ant_system_Optimization_by_a_colony_of_cooperating_agents","292691910_A_discrete_particle_swarm_optimization_algorithm_for_the_no-wait_flowshop_scheduling_problem_with_makespan_and_total_flowtime_criteria","291858732_Application_of_a_hybrid_genetic_algorithm_in_the_load_balancing_of_cloud_computing","285374796_Task_scheduling_optimization_for_the_cloud_computing_systems","284048685_The_particle_swarm_explosion_stability_and_convergence_in_multi-dimensional_complex_space","283996103_Genetic_Algorithms_In_Search_Optimization_and_Machine_Learning","278689884_An_Optimal_Algorithm_for_Resource_Scheduling_in_Cloud_Computing","277295384_Above_the_Clouds_A_Berkeley_View_of_Cloud_Computing","273453883_Particle_Swarm_Optimization","268372223_Scheduling_and_Management_of_Data_Intensive_Application_Workflows_in_Grid_and_Cloud_Computing_Environments","267824936_Task_Scheduling_Optimization_in_Cloud_Computing_Based_on_Heuristic_Algorithm","267056678_Scheduling_Theory_algorithms_and_systems_4th_ed","265978039_Energy-aware_and_revenue-enhancing_Combinatorial_Scheduling_in_Virtualized_of_Cloud_Datacenter","263605648_Computer_and_Intractability_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness","262350694_Hybrid_enhanced_ant_colony_algorithm_and_enhanced_bee_colony_algorithm_for_grid_scheduling","261483330_Multi-objective_optimization_model_of_virtual_resources_scheduling_under_cloud_computing_and_it's_solution","261310626_Cloud_Computing-Task_scheduling_based_on_genetic_algorithms","257252161_Profit-driven_scheduling_for_cloud_services_with_data_access_awareness","257251989_Online_Optimization_for_Scheduling_Preemptable_tasks_on_IaaS_Cloud_systems","254653565_A_Genetic_Algorithm_Scheduling_Approach_for_Virtual_Machine_Resources_in_a_Cloud_Computing_Environment","254052253_Ant_Colony_Optimization_Based_Service_Flow_Scheduling_with_Various_QoS_Requirements_in_Cloud_Computing","254015403_Energy_adaptive_immune_genetic_algorithm_for_collaborative_design_task_scheduling_in_Cloud_Manufacturing_system","252052046_A_load-adapative_cloud_resource_scheduling_model_based_on_ant_colony_algorithm","251997782_An_approach_for_cloud_resource_scheduling_based_on_Parallel_Genetic_Algorithm","251974703_Genetic_simulated_annealing_algorithm_for_task_scheduling_based_on_cloud_computing_environment","242579007_Job_Shop_Scheduling_by_Simulated_Annealing","238652069_Adaptation_in_Natural_and_Arti_cial_Systems_An_Introductory_Analysis_With_Applications_to_Biology","232398745_A_Parallel_Bi-objective_Hybrid_Metaheuristic_for_Energy-aware_Scheduling_for_Cloud_Computing_Systems","230660832_Ant_Colony_Optimization_and_Swarm_Intelligence_4th_International_Workshop_ANTS_2004","230595985_Optimization_and_Approximation_in_Deterministic_Sequencing_and_Scheduling_A_Survey","230595796_Heuristic_Scheduling_Systems","230595710_Handbook_of_Scheduling_Algorithms_Models_and_Performance_Analysis","230341695_Static_and_dynamic_scheduling_of_customer_arrivals_to_a_single-server_system","229441663_Optimal_Two_and_Three_Stage_Production_Schedules_With_Set-Up_Time_Included","229344323_Genetic_algorithms_applied_to_the_scheduling_of_the_hubble_space_telescope","228540568_Ant_system_for_job-shop_scheduling","228436903_QoS-oriented_sesource_allocation_and_scheduling_of_multiple_composite_web_services_in_a_hybrid_cloud_using_a_random-key_genetic_algorithm","228346477_Tabu_Search","229124496_Introduction_to_Sequencing_and_Scheduling","228038684_The_Grid_A_New_Infrastructure_for_21st_Century_Science"]}
