{"id":"287479922_The_challenge_of_time-predictability_in_modern_many-core_architectures","abstract":"The recent technological advancements and market trends are causing an interesting phenomenon towards the convergence of High-Performance Computing (HPC) and Embedded Computing (EC) domains. Many recent HPC applications require huge amounts of information to be processed within a bounded amount of time while EC systems are increasingly concerned with providing higher performance in real-time. The convergence of these two domains towards systems requiring both high performance and a predictable time-behavior challenges the capabilities of current hardware architectures. Fortunately, the advent of next-generation many-core embedded platforms has the chance of intercepting this converging need for predictability and high-performance, allowing HPC and EC applications to be executed on efficient and powerful heterogeneous architectures integrating general-purpose processors with many-core computing fabrics. However, addressing this mixed set of requirements is not without its own challenges and it is now of paramount importance to develop new techniques to exploit the massively parallel computation capabilities of many-core platforms in a predictable way. © Vincent Nélis, Patrick Meumeu Yomsi, Luís Miguel Pinho, José Carlos Fonseca, Marko Bertogna, Eduardo Quiñones, Roberto Vargas, and Andrea Marongiu.","authors":["Vincent Nelis","Patrick Meumeu Yomsi","Luís Miguel Pinho","J.C.
