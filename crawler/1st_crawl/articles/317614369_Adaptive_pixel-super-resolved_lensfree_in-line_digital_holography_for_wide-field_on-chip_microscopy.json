{"id":"317614369_Adaptive_pixel-super-resolved_lensfree_in-line_digital_holography_for_wide-field_on-chip_microscopy","abstract":"High-resolution wide field-of-view (FOV) microscopic imaging plays an essential role in various fields of biomedicine, engineering, and physical sciences. As an alternative to conventional lens-based scanning techniques, lensfree holography provides a new way to effectively bypass the intrinsical trade-off between the spatial resolution and FOV of conventional microscopes. Unfortunately, due to the limited sensor pixel-size, unpredictable disturbance during image acquisition, and sub-optimum solution to the phase retrieval problem, typical lensfree microscopes only produce compromised imaging quality in terms of lateral resolution and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Here, we propose an adaptive pixel-super-resolved lensfree imaging (APLI) method which can solve, or at least partially alleviate these limitations. Our approach addresses the pixel aliasing problem by Z-scanning only, without resorting to subpixel shifting or beam-angle manipulation. Automatic positional error correction algorithm and adaptive relaxation strategy are introduced to enhance the robustness and SNR of reconstruction significantly. Based on APLI, we perform full-FOV reconstruction of a USAF resolution target ($\\sim$29.85 $m{m^2}$) and achieve half-pitch lateral resolution of 770 $nm$, surpassing 2.17 times of the theoretical Nyquist-Shannon sampling resolution limit imposed by the sensor pixel-size (1.67 $\\mu m$). Full-FOV imaging result of a typical dicot root is also provided to demonstrate its promising potential applications in biologic imaging.","authors":["Jialin Zhang","Jiasong Sun","Qian Chen","Jiaji Li"],"meta":["September 2017Scientific Reports 7(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-017-11715-x"],"references":["316478946_Resolution-enhanced_Fourier_ptychographic_microscopy_based_on_high-numerical-aperture_illuminations","316105436_High-resolution_transport-of-intensity_quantitative_phase_microscopy_with_annular_illumination","310952588_Computational_out-of-focus_imaging_increases_the_space-bandwidth_product_in_lens-based_coherent_microscopy","300086693_Pixel_super-resolution_using_wavelength_scanning","297895836_Propagation_phasor_approach_for_holographic_image_reconstruction","283256247_Portable_lensless_wide-field_microscopy_imaging_platform_based_on_digital_inline_holography_and_multi-frame_pixel_super-resolution","307958236_Adaptive_step-size_strategy_for_noise-robust_Fourier_ptychographic_microscopy","303782982_Portable_lensless_wide-field_microscopy_imaging_platform_based_on_digital_inline_holography_and_multiframe_pixel_super-resolution","289676090_Introduction_to_fourier_optics","277948408_Lensless_phase_microscopy_and_diffraction_tomography_with_multi-angle_and_multi-wavelength_illuminations_using_a_LED_matrix","274407198_Synthetic_aperture-based_on-chip_microscopy","263710611_Multiplexed_coded_illumination_for_Fourier_Ptychography_with_an_LED_array_microscope","260206053_Corrigendum_Wide-field_high-resolution_Fourier_ptychographic_microscopy","269766726_Wide-field_computational_imaging_of_pathology_slides_using_lens-free_on-chip_microscopy","239650622_Iterative_algorithms_for_twin-image_elimination_in_in-line_holography_using_finite-support_constraints"]}
