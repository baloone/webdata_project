{"id":"233360031_Formation_operators_on_classes_of_algebras","abstract":"Let form be the formation generated by a class of algebras . The properties of form have been studied by Shemetkov, Skiba and others since 1981. In this paper, we consider as an operator acting on the set of classes of algebras and extend it to the closure operator ``'' for some subsystem functors . New results are obtained and some known results are generalized. In addition, the algebras in are considered.","authors":["Wenbin Guo","Kar Ping Shum"],"meta":["February 2007Communications in Algebra 30(7)(7):3457-3472","DOI:10.1081/AGB-120004498"],"references":["346681110_Finite_Soluble_Groups","282370070_Varieties_of_Groups","268892360_The_amalgamation_of_closure_and_boundary_functions_on_semigroups_and_partially_ordered_sets","266523703_The_closure_operators_of_a_lattice","234144546_On_Normally_Embedded_Projectors_in_Finite_Soluble_Groups","231942773_Minimal_verbal_subgroups","38347971_A_Lattice-Theoretical_Fixpoint_Theorem_and_Its_Applications"]}
