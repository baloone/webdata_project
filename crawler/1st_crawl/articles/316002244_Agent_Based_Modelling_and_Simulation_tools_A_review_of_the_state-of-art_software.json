{"id":"316002244_Agent_Based_Modelling_and_Simulation_tools_A_review_of_the_state-of-art_software","abstract":"The key intent of this work is to present a comprehensive comparative literature survey of the state-of-art in software agent-based computing technology and its incorporation within the modelling and simulation domain. The original contribution of this survey is two-fold: (1) Present a concise characterization of almost the entire spectrum of agent-based modelling and simulation tools, thereby highlighting the salient features, merits, and shortcomings of such multi-faceted application software; this article covers eighty five agent-based toolkits that may assist the system designers and developers with common tasks, such as constructing agent-based models and portraying the real-time simulation outputs in tabular/graphical formats and visual recordings. (2) Provide a usable reference that aids engineers, researchers, learners and academicians in readily selecting an appropriate agent-based modelling and simulation toolkit for designing and developing their system models and prototypes, cognizant of both their expertise and those requirements of their application domain. In a nutshell, a significant synthesis of Agent Based Modelling and Simulation (ABMS) resources has been performed in this review that stimulates further investigation into this topic.","authors":["Sameera Abar","Georgios Theodoropoulos","Pierre Lemarinier","Gregory O'Hare"],"meta":["March 2017Computer Science Review 24","DOI:10.1016/j.cosrev.2017.03.001"],"references":["308612157_Simple_or_complicated_agent-based_models_A_complicated_issue","302923196_Everything_you_need_to_know_about_agent-based_modelling_and_simulation","299130678_Integrating_BDI_Agents_with_Agent-Based_Simulation_Platforms","284205394_A_Survey_of_Agent_Platforms","283854954_Agent_Platform_Evaluation_and_Comparison","282122168_A_spatially_explicit_agent-based_model_of_the_diffusion_of_green_electricity_Model_setup_and_retrodictive_validation","273846741_An_Introduction_to_Agent-Based_Modeling_for_Undergraduates","272161266_Principles_and_Concepts_of_Agent-Based_Modelling_for_Developing_Geospatial_Simulations","228638878_Distributing_RePast_agent-based_simulations_with_HLA","224396402_Agent-Based_Tools_for_Modeling_and_Simulation_of_Self-Organization_in_Peer-to-Peer_Ad_Hoc_and_Other_Complex_Networks","221528796_Agent-based_modeling_and_simulation_ABMS_examples","221396489_Agent_Migration_and_Communication_in_WSNs","220403204_Embedded_agents_A_paradigm_for_mobile_services","220136532_Distributed_simulation_of_agent-based_systems_with_HLA","220116660_Tutorial_on_agent-based_modelling_and_simulation","50946267_A_Survey_on_Comparative_Study_of_Mobile_Agent_Platforms","46486710_Agent_Based_Modeling_and_Simulation_An_Informatics_Perspective","46486709_Tools_of_the_Trade_A_Survey_of_Various_Agent_Based_Modeling_Platforms","26425460_A_Survey_of_Programming_Languages_and_Platforms_for_Multi-Agent_Systems","5140398_Evaluation_of_free_Java-libraries_for_social-scientific_agent_based_simulation","5131051_Handbook_of_computational_economics_II_Agent-Based_computational_economics","310815430_A_return_on_experience_from_the_application_of_agent-based_simulations_coupled_with_life_cycle_assessment_to_model_agricultural_processes","310541599_Agent-based_modelling_and_mental_simulation_for_resilience_engineering_in_air_transport","309898729_Theoretical_foundations_of_human_decision-making_in_agent-based_land_use_models_-_A_review","307512693_A_survey_on_parallel_and_distributed_multi-agent_systems_for_high_performance_computing_simulations","304105541_Realizing_parameterless_automatic_classification_of_remote_sensing_imagery_using_ontology_engineering_and_cyberinfrastructure_techniques","280645962_Managing_Business_Complexity_Discovering_Strategic_Solutions_With_Agent-Based_Modeling_and_Simulation","261884664_Agent-based_simulation_applications_in_marketing_research_An_integrated_review","258260755_Agent-Based_and_Individual-Based_Modeling_A_Practical_Introduction","236488131_Agent-based_modeling_and_simulation_for_EXASCALE_computing","222816569_Appendix_A_A_Guide_for_Newcomers_to_Agent-Based_Modeling_in_the_Social_Sciences","222712687_Agent-based_Simulation_Platforms_Review_and_Development_Recommendations","220798300_A_UML_Profile_for_Agent-Based_Development","220637752_Agent-based_simulation_of_electricity_markets_A_survey_of_tools","220238152_A_Knowledge-Based_Strategy_for_the_Automated_Support_to_Network_Management_Tasks","49762880_WGO_Training_Center_update","11360893_Platforms_and_methods_for_agent-based_modeling"]}
