{"id":"322797649_Newton's_Backward_Interpolation_Representation_of_Numerical_Data_by_a_Polynomial_Curve","abstract":"In order to reduce the numerical computations associated to the repeated application of the existing interpolation formula in computing a large number of interpolated values, a formula has been derived from Newtonâ€™s backward interpolation formula for representing the numerical data on a pair of variables by a polynomial curve. Application of the formula to numerical data has been shown in the case of representing the data on the total population of India corresponding as a function of time. The formula is suitable in the situation where the values of the argument (i.e. independent variable) are at equal interval.","authors":["Dhritikesh Chakrabarty","Biswajit Das"],"meta":["September 2016"],"references":["306107098_Numerical_Methods_for_Engineers_Fourth_Edition","275753008_Numerical_Method_in_Finite_Element_Analysis","273244206_An_Introduction_to_Numerical_Analysis","269857571_Numerical_Mathematical_Analysis","266535310_An_Introduction_to_Numerical_Analysis","242498465_Elementary_Numerical_Analysis","220689710_Applied_Numerical_Analysis","27298666_Numerical_Methods_Using_Matlab"]}
