{"id":"313968386_The_2-good-neighbor_2-extra_diagnosability_of_alternating_group_graph_networks_under_the_PMC_model_and_MM_model","abstract":"Diagnosability of a multiprocessor system is one important study topic. In 2012, Peng et al. proposed a measure for fault tolerance of the system, which is called the g-good-neighbor diagnosability that restrains every fault-free node containing at least g fault-free neighbors. In 2016, Zhang et al. proposed a new measure for fault diagnosis of the system, namely, the g-extra diagnosability, which restrains that every fault-free component has at least fault-free nodes. As a favorable topology structure of interconnection networks, the n-dimensional alternating group graph network ANn has many good properties. In this paper, we obtain that (a) the 2-good-neighbor diagnosability of ANn is for n ≥ 4 under the PMC model and MM* model; (b) the 2-extra diagnosability of ANn is for n ≥ 4 under the PMC model, and the 2-extra diagnosability of ANn is for n ≥ 5 under the MM* model. These results are optimal with respect to 2-extra diagnosability of ANn.","authors":["Shiying Wang","Yuxing Yang"],"meta":["July 2017Applied Mathematics and Computation 305(4):241-250","DOI:10.1016/j.amc.2017.02.006"],"references":["308485884_Some_Properties_of_the_g_-Good-Neighbor_g_-Extra_Diagnosability_of_a_Multiprocessor_System","284142960_A_comparison_connection_assignment_for_self-diagnosis_of_multiprocessor_systems","273523144_The_g-Good-Neighbor_Conditional_Diagnosability_of_k-Ary_n-Cubes_under_the_PMC_Model_and_MM_Model","220359136_A_note_on_the_alternating_group_network","220358541_Construction_of_vertex-disjoint_paths_in_alternating_group_networks","3049417_Internode_Distance_and_Optimal_Routing_in_a_Class_of_Alternating_Group_Networks","3044866_Conditional_diagnosability_measures_for_large_multiprocessor_systems","319259354_On_fault_tolerance_of_n_k_-star_networks","309330267_The_2-good-neighbor_connectivity_and_2-good-neighbor_diagnosability_of_bubble-sort_star_graph_networks","308756893_Reliability_of_Complete_Cubic_Networks_under_the_Condition_of_g_-Good-Neighbor","305749910_The_2-Extra_Connectivity_and_2-Extra_Diagnosability_of_Bubble-Sort_Star_Graph_Networks","301335895_Mitotic_Spindle_Assembly_The_Roles_of_Microtubule_Nucleation_and_Assembly","301248292_The_g-good-neighbor_conditional_diagnosability_of_n-dimensional_hypercubes_under_the_MM_model","299344525_The_2-good-neighbor_diagnosability_of_Cayley_graphs_generated_by_transposition_trees_under_the_PMC_model_and_MM_model","295254875_G-Good-neighbor_conditional_diagnosability_measures_for_3-ary_n-cube_networks","286378923_The_1-good-neighbor_diagnosability_of_Cayley_graphs_generated_by_transposition_trees_under_the_PMC_model_and_MM_model","273490370_The_g_-extra_conditional_diagnosability_and_sequential_t_k_-diagnosability_of_hypercubes","267506801_Fault-tolerance_of_-star_networks","260585389_The_Conditional_Diagnosability_of_k-Ary_n-Cubes_under_the_Comparison_Diagnosis_Model","221132175_The_Diagnosability_of_g-good-neighbor_Conditional-Faulty_Hypercube_under_PMC_Model","220329229_A_Group-Theoretic_Model_for_Symmetric_Interconnection_Networks","220295209_Diagnosability_of_Crossed_Cubes_under_the_Comparison_Diagnosis_Model","220112540_The_n_k-Star_Graph_A_Generalized_Star_Graph","220111456_Conditional_diagnosability_of_alternating_group_networks","3477231_On_the_Connection_Assignment_Problem_of_Diagnosable_Systems","3048452_An_0n25_Fault_Identification_Algorithm_for_Diagnosable_Systems","3043034_On_Self-Diagnosable_Multiprocessor_Systems_Diagnosis_by_the_Comparison_Approach"]}
