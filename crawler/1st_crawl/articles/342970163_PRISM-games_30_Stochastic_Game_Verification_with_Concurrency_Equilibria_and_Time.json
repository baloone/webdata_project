{"id":"342970163_PRISM-games_30_Stochastic_Game_Verification_with_Concurrency_Equilibria_and_Time","abstract":"We present a major new release of the PRISM-games model checker, featuring multiple significant advances in its support for verification and strategy synthesis of stochastic games. Firstly, concurrent stochastic games bring more realistic modelling of agents interacting in a concurrent fashion. Secondly, equilibria-based properties provide a means to analyse games in which competing or collaborating players are driven by distinct objectives. Thirdly, a real-time extension of (turn-based) stochastic games facilitates verification and strategy synthesis for systems where timing is a crucial aspect. This paper describes the advances made in the toolâ€™s modelling language, property specification language and model checking engines in order to implement this new functionality. We also summarise the performance and scalability of the tool, and describe a selection of case studies, ranging from security protocols to robot coordination, which highlight the benefits of the new features.","authors":["Marta Kwiatkowska","Gethin Norman","David Parker","Gabriel Santos"],"meta":["July 2020","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-53291-8_25","In book: Computer Aided Verification (pp.475-487)"],"references":["335174476_Social_dilemmas_among_unequals","327970322_EVE_A_Tool_for_Temporal_Equilibrium_Analysis_16th_International_Symposium_ATVA_2018_Los_Angeles_CA_USA_October_7-10_2018_Proceedings","321700727_PRISM-games_verification_and_strategy_synthesis_for_stochastic_multi-player_games_with_multiple_objectives","312076195_Interval_iteration_algorithm_for_MDPs_and_IMDPs","337434641_Rethinking_search_engines_and_recommendation_systems_a_game_theoretic_perspective","337039702_Verification_and_Control_of_Turn-Based_Probabilistic_Real-Time_Games","335984312_Equilibria-Based_Probabilistic_Model_Checking_for_Concurrent_Stochastic_Games","327031461_Automated_Verification_of_Concurrent_Stochastic_Games_15th_International_Conference_QEST_2018_Beijing_China_September_4-7_2018_Proceedings","326523628_Value_Iteration_for_Simple_Stochastic_Games_Stopping_Criterion_and_Learning_Algorithm_30th_International_Conference_CAV_2018_Held_as_Part_of_the_Federated_Logic_Conference_FloC_2018_Oxford_UK_July_14-","318364789_Ensuring_the_Reliability_of_Your_Model_Checker_Interval_Iteration_for_Markov_Decision_Processes"]}
