{"id":"336394768_Symmetry_of_minimizers_of_a_Gaussian_isoperimetric_problem","abstract":"We study an isoperimetric problem described by a functional that consists of the standard Gaussian perimeter and the norm of the barycenter. The second term is in competition with the perimeter, balancing the mass with respect to the origin, and because of that the solution is not always the half-space. We characterize all the minimizers of this functional, when the volume is close to one, by proving that the minimizer is either the half-space or the symmetric strip, depending on the strength of the barycenter term. As a corollary, we obtain that the symmetric strip is the solution of the Gaussian isoperimetric problem among symmetric sets when the volume is close to one. As another corollary we obtain the optimal constant in the quantitative Gaussian isoperimetric inequality.","authors":["Marco Barchiesi","Vesa Julin"],"meta":["June 2020Probability Theory and Related Fields 177(1-2):1-40","DOI:10.1007/s00440-019-00947-9"],"references":["321435153_An_Old_Problem_Resurfaces_Nonlocally_Gamow's_Liquid_Drops_Inspire_Today's_Research_and_Applications","318304131_Local_minimality_of_the_ball_for_the_Gaussian_perimeter","307303130_Robustness_of_the_Gaussian_concentration_inequality_and_the_Brunn-Minkowski_inequality","283471366_Low_Correlation_Noise_Stability_of_Symmetric_Sets","317010266_Symmetric_Convex_Sets_with_Minimal_Gaussian_Surface_Area","305654847_On_the_entropy_of_closed_hypersurfaces_and_singular_self-shrinkers","292339424_A_quantitative_isoperimetric_inequality_on_the_sphere","283170458_The_quantitative_isoperimetric_inequality_and_related_topics","268907837_Mass_Defect_Curve_and_Nuclear_Constitution","266705915_Minimal_Surfaces_and_Functions_of_Bounded_Variation"]}
