{"id":"339840358_Delivering_time-evolving_3D_city_models_for_web_visualization","abstract":"Studying and planning urban evolution is essential for understanding the past and designing the cities of the future and can be facilitated by providing means for sharing, visualizing, and navigating in cities, on the web, in space and in time. Standard formats, methods, and tools exist for visualizing large-scale 3D cities on the web. In this paper, we go further by integrating the temporal dimension of cities in geospatial web delivery standard formats. In doing so, we enable interactive visualization of large-scale time-evolving 3D city models on the web. A key characteristic of this paper lies in the proposed four-step generic approach. First, we design a generic conceptual model of standard formats for delivering 3D cities on the web. Then, we formalize and integrate the temporal dimension of cities into this generic conceptual model. Following which, we specify the conceptual model in the 3D Tiles standard at logical and technical specification levels, resulting in an extension of 3D Tiles for delivering time-evolving 3D city models on the web. Finally, we propose an open-source implementation, experiments, and an evaluation of the propositions and visualization rules. We also provide access to reproducibility notes allowing researchers to replicate all the experiments.","authors":["Vincent Jaillot","Sylvie Servigne","Gilles Gesqui√®re"],"meta":["April 2020International Journal of Geographical Information Science 34(4)","DOI:10.1080/13658816.2020.1749637","Project: Virtual City - Liris Lab CNRS Univ.
