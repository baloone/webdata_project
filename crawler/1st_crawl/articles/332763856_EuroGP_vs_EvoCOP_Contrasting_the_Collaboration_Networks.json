{"id":"332763856_EuroGP_vs_EvoCOP_Contrasting_the_Collaboration_Networks","abstract":"Using an online database with bibliographic information on major computer science publications we have constructed collaboration networks for the two main EvoStar (the leading European event on Bio-Inspired Computation) conferences: EuroGP (European Conference on Genetic Programming) and EvoCOP (Evolutionary Computation in Combinatorial Optimisation). In these networks, two authors are connected if they have coauthored one or more papers appearing in these conferences since their inception until 2018. The networks are then visualised and analysed using a number of network statistics. Our main focus is to reveal and contrast the patterns of collaboration and the most active researchers in both conferences. EuroGPâ€™s network shows a large central component of connected authors, whereas EvoCOP authors appear to work in small groups without direct interaction between groups. This could be explained by the different origins and composition of these two communities.","authors":["Mila Goranova","Gabriela Ochoa","Marco Tomassini"],"meta":["April 2019ACM SIGEVOlution 12(1):6-12","DOI:10.1145/3328473.3328475"],"references":["303214441_Gephi_An_Open_Source_Software_for_Exploring_and_Manipulating_Networks","221995787_The_Igraph_Software_Package_for_Complex_Network_Research","222671188_A_Measure_of_Betweenness_Centrality_based_on_Random_Walks","220447062_The_Anatomy_of_a_Large-Scale_Hypertextual_Web_Search_Engine","220285889_The_structure_of_the_genetic_programming_collaboration_network","220048511_Complex_networks_and_evolutionary_computation","45854744_Community_Detection_in_Graphs","11881413_Scientific_Collaboration_Networks_II_Shortest_Paths_Weighted_Networks_and_Centrality","11881412_Scientific_collaboration_networks_I_Network_construction_and_fundamental_results","8901684_Coauthorship_Networks_and_Patterns_of_Scientific_Collaboration","2173527_The_Complex_Network_of_Evolutionary_Computation_Authors_an_Initial_Study","1913681_Fast_Unfolding_of_Communities_in_Large_Networks"]}
