{"id":"278685728_Modelling_of_Building_Interiors_with_Mobile_Phone_Sensor_Data","abstract":"Creating as-built plans of building interiors is a challenging task. In this paper we present a semi-automatic modelling system for creating residential building interior plans and their integration with existing map data to produce building models. Taking a set of imprecise measurements made with an interactive mobile phone room mapping application, the system performs spatial adjustments in accordance with soft and hard constraints imposed on the building plan geometry. The approach uses an optimisation model that exploits a high accuracy building outline, such as can be found in topographic map data, and the building topology to improve the quality of interior measurements and generate a standardised output. We test our system on building plans of five residential homes. Our evaluation shows that the approach enables construction of accurate interior plans from imprecise measurements. The experiments report an average accuracy of 0.24 m, close to the 0.20 m recommended by the CityGML LoD4 specification.","authors":["Julian Rosser","Jeremy G Morley","Gavin Smith"],"meta":["June 2015International Journal of Geo-Information 4(2):989","DOI:10.3390/ijgi4020989"],"references":["274117208_Mobile_modelling_for_crowdsourcing_building_interior_data","273342706_Grammar_Supported_Indoor_Mapping","271073380_Piecewise_Planar_and_Compact_Floorplan_Reconstruction_from_Images","261111897_Interactive_syntactic_modeling_with_a_single-point_laser_range_finder_and_camera","315497580_Solving_Problems_in_Scientific_Computing_Using_Maple_and_Matlab_R","285796755_Education_for_active_citizenship_Practices_policies_and_promises","262406682_Hallway_based_automatic_indoor_floorplan_construction_using_room_fingerprints","262177455_Structural_Optimization_of_3D_Masonry_Buildings","262175124_Capturing_indoor_scenes_with_smartphones","261884349_Effective_Mobile_Mapping_of_Multi-room_Indoor_Structures"]}
