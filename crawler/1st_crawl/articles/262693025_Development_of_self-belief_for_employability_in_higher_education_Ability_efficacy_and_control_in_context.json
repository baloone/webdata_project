{"id":"262693025_Development_of_self-belief_for_employability_in_higher_education_Ability_efficacy_and_control_in_context","abstract":"Self-belief is argued here to be a key aspect of employability development that has been largely under conceptualisation in terms of what the construct may mean and how it may be developed through higher education (HE) study. This paper proposes three fundamental beliefs that need to be fostered in order to develop student self-belief: (1) that ability can be improved; (2) that one has the ability to achieve one's goals; and (3) that the environment will allow for goal attainment. Self-belief needs to be developed within the HE curriculum in the context of disciplinary knowledge and skills. The factors that may influence the development of these beliefs within the curriculum will be explored along with implications for practice that may support the development of self-belief and contribute to the production of employable graduates from HE.","authors":["Nancy Turner"],"meta":["March 2014Teaching in Higher Education 19(6)","DOI:10.1080/13562517.2014.901951"],"references":["249006351_Reconsidering_Graduate_Employability_The_'graduate_identity'_approach","247505640_Fear_of_Failure_Friend_or_Foe","241333664_Locus_of_Control_Self-Efficacy_and_Motivation_in_Different_Schools_Is_moderation_the_key_to_success","234605864_Graduates'_Employment_and_the_Discourse_of_Employability_A_Critical_Analysis","225083582_Employability_in_Higher_Education_What_It_Is_What_It_Is_Not","32116377_Self-Efficacy_Self-Esteem_and_Their_Impact_on_Academic_Performance","14374538_A_Guide_to_Constructs_of_Control","7918097_Reducing_the_Drop-Out_Rates_of_At-Risk_High_School_Students_The_Effective_Learning_Program_ELP","316753512_Perceived_control_in_college_students_Implications_for_instruction_in_higher_education","312665578_Graduates'_Work_Implications_of_Organizational_Change_for_the_Development_of_Student_Attributes","291831806_A_Will_to_Learn_Being_a_Student_in_an_Age_of_Uncertainty","257045180_A_performance_comparison_of_motivational_self-believers_and_self-doubters_in_competitive_and_individualistic_goal_situations","248940476_Predicting_Retention_in_Online_General_Education_Courses","247822386_The_critical_thinking_debate_how_general_are_general_thinking_skills","244462798_Generic_Skills_in_the_Context_of_Higher_Education","242032870_Employability_and_Good_Learning_in_Higher_Education","238398084_A_social_constructivist_assessment_process_model_How_the_research_literature_shows_us_this_could_be_best_practice","237063306_Conditions_Under_Which_Assessment_Supports_Students'_Learning","237009897_Self-Theories_Their_Role_in_Motivation_Personality_and_Development","235260791_The_key_to_employability_Developing_a_practical_model_of_graduate_employability","234685038_Graduates'_Work_Organisational_Change_and_Students'_Attributes","234630755_Locus_of_Control_Academic_Achievement_and_Retention_in_a_Sample_of_University_First-Year_Students","233693946_Knowing_and_Becoming_in_the_Higher_Education_Curriculum","232603513_Role_of_Self-Efficacy_and_Self-Concept_Beliefs_in_Mathematical_Problem_Solving_A_Path_Analysis","232600142_Self-Evaluative_and_Self-Efficacy_Mechanisms_Governing_the_Motivational_Effects_of_Goal_Systems","232508902_Expectations_and_Performance_An_Empirical_Test_of_Bandura's_Self-efficacy_Theory","232467305_Multiple_Goals_Multiple_Pathways_The_Role_of_Goal_Orientation_in_Learning_and_Achievement","232424647_Control_and_Efficacy_as_Interdisciplinary_Bridges","222529322_Self-Efficacy_An_Essential_Motive_to_Learn","222415067_Accounting_for_structure_and_agency_in_'close-up'_research_on_teaching_learning_and_assessment_in_higher_education","44820920_Developing_Professional_Knowledge_and_Competence","44817353_Learning_discourse_Qualitative_research_in_education","42796026_Assessing_the_self-esteem_of_female_undergraduate_students_An_issue_of_methodology","42792777_Evidence-Informed_Pedagogy_and_the_Enhancement_of_Student_Employability","42788720_Self-Theories_Some_Implications_for_Teaching_and_Learning_in_Higher_Education","20372972_Human_Agency_in_Social_Cognitive_Theory","17828017_General_Expectancies_for_Internal_Versus_External_Control_of_Reinforcement","12694620_An_Achievement_Goal_Theory_Perspective_on_Issues_in_Motivation_Terminology_Theory_and_Research","11250027_Implicit_theories_of_intelligence_across_academic_domains_A_study_of_meaning_making_in_adolescents_of_Mexican_descent"]}
