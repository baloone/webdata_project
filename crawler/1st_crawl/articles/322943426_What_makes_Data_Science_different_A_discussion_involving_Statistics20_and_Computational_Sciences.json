{"id":"322943426_What_makes_Data_Science_different_A_discussion_involving_Statistics20_and_Computational_Sciences","abstract":"Data Science is today one of the main buzzwords, be it in business, industrial or academic settings. Machine learning, experimental design, data-driven modelling are all, undoubtedly, rising disciplines if one goes by the soaring number of research papers and patents appearing each year. The prospect of becoming a “Data Scientist” appeals to many. A discussion panel organised as part of the European Data Science Conference (European Association for Data Science (EuADS)) https://euads.org/edsc/ asked the question: “What makes Data Science different?” In this paper, we give our own, personal and multi-faceted view on this question, from a Statistics and an Engineering perspective. In particular, we compare Data Science to Statistics and discuss the connection between Data Science and Computational Sciences.","authors":["Christophe Ley","Stéphane Pierre Alain Bordas"],"meta":["November 2018International Journal of Data Science and Analytics 6(3)","DOI:10.1007/s41060-017-0090-x"],"references":["319047599_Bayesian_inference_to_identify_parameters_in_viscoelasticity","318215841_A_Scaled_Boundary_Finite_Element_Formulation_with_Bubble_Functions_for_Elasto-static_Analyses_of_Functionally_Graded_Materials","317552963_Weakening_the_tight_coupling_between_geometry_and_simulation_in_isogeometric_analysis_from_sub-_and_super-_geometric_analysis_to_Geometry_Independent_Field_approximaTion_GIFT","317552883_Weakening_the_tight_coupling_between_geometry_and_simulation_in_isogeometric_analysis_from_sub-and_super-geometric_analysis_to_Geometry_Independent_Field_approximaTion_GIFT","316471346_Controlling_the_Error_on_Target_Motion_through_Real-time_Mesh_Adaptation_Applications_to_Deep_Brain_Stimulation","327364434_Modern_Directional_Statistics","322982348_Weakening_the_tight_coupling_between_geometry_and_simulation_in_isogeometric_analysis_From_sub-_and_super-geometric_analysis_to_Geometry-Independent_Field_approximaTion_GIFT_GIFT","318071894_Data_Science_A_Comprehensive_Overview","318018968_Sparse_Bayesian_Non-linear_Regression_for_Multiple_Onsets_Estimation_in_Non-invasive_Cardiac_Electrophysiology","317129155_Real-Time_Error_Control_for_Surgical_Simulation"]}
