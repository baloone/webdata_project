{"id":"350421737_FAULT-TOLERANT_METRIC_DIMENSION_OF_CIRCULANT_GRAPHS","abstract":"A set $W$ of vertices in a graph $G$ is called a resolving setfor $G$ if for every pair of distinct vertices $u$ and $v$ of $G$ there exists a vertex $w \\in W$ such that the distance between $u$ and $w$ is different from the distance between $v$ and $w$. The cardinality of a minimum resolving set is called the metric dimension of $G$, denoted by $\\beta(G)$. A resolving set $W'$ for $G$ is fault-tolerant if $W'\\setminus \\left\\lbrace w\\right\\rbrace $ for each $w$ in $W'$, is also a resolving set and the fault-tolerant metric dimension of $G$ is the minimum cardinality of such a set, denoted by $\\beta'(G)$. The circulant graph is a graph with vertex set $\\mathbb{Z}_{n}$, an additive group of integers modulo $n$, and two vertices labeled $i$ and $j$ adjacent if and only if $i -j \\left( mod \\ n \\right) \\in C$, where $C \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ has the property that $C=-C$ and $0 \\notin C$. The circulant graph is denoted by $X_{n,\\bigtriangleup}$ where $\\bigtriangleup = \\vert C\\vert$. In this paper, we study the fault-tolerant metric dimension of a family of circulant graphs $X_{n,3}$ with connection set $C=\\lbrace 1,\\dfrac{n}{2},n-1\\rbrace$ and circulant graphs $X_{n,4}$ with connection set $C=\\lbrace \\pm 1,\\pm 2\\rbrace$.","authors":["Narjes Seyedi","Hamid Reza Maimani"],"meta":["December 2019Facta Universitatis Series Mathematics and Informatics","DOI:10.22190/FUMI1904781S"],"references":["264553656_Families_of_regular_graphs_with_constant_metric_dimension","259574039_Fault-Tolerant_Metric_and_Partition_Dimension_of_Graphs","259573732_Fault-tolerance_in_resolvability","257481459_Resolvability_in_circulant_graphs","239920490_Fault-Tolerant_Metric_Dimension_of_Graphs","1958724_Virtual_Coordinate_Backtracking_for_Void_Traversal_in_Geographic_Routing","276839023_Algebraic_graph_theory","267067206_The_theory_and_applications_of_resolvability_in_graphs_A_survey","264960330_On_the_metric_dimension_of_a_graph","226705873_On_k-dimensional_graphs_and_their_bases","222514864_Resolvability_in_graphs_and_the_metric_dimension_of_a_graph"]}
