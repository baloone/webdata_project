{"id":"234005110_QMA-complete_problems","abstract":"In this paper we give an overview of the quantum computational complexity\nclass QMA and a description of known QMA-complete problems to date. Such\nproblems are believed to be difficult to solve, even with a quantum computer,\nbut have the property that if a purported solution to the problem is given, a\nquantum computer would easily be able to verify whether it is correct. An\nattempt has been made to make this paper as self-contained as possible so that\nit can be accessible to computer scientists, physicists, mathematicians, and\nquantum chemists. Problems of interest to all of these professions can be found\nhere.","authors":["Adam D.
