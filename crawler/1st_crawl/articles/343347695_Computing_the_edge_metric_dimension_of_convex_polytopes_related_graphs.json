{"id":"343347695_Computing_the_edge_metric_dimension_of_convex_polytopes_related_graphs","abstract":"Let G = (V(G), E(G)) be a connected graph. Let d(f,y) denotes the distance between edge f and vertex y, defined as d(f,y) = min{d(p,y), d(q,y)}, where f= pq. A subset WE contains in V(G) is called an edge metric generator for graph G if for every two distinct edges f1, f2 belong to E(G), there exists a vertex y belongs WE such that d(f1,y) is not equal to d(f2,y). An edge metric generator with minimum number of vertices is called an edge metric basis for graph G and the cardinality of an edge metric basis is called the edge metric dimension represented by edim(G). In this paper, we study the edge metric dimension of flower graph fnx3. We also calculate the edge metric dimension of the prism related graphs Dn' and Dnt. We concluded that the edge metric dimension of Dn' is bounded, while of fnx3 and Dnt is unbounded.","authors":["Dr Muhammad Ahsan","Zohaib Zahid","Sohail Zafar","Arif Rafiq"],"meta":["July 2020","DOI:10.22436/jmcs.022.02.08","Project: EDGE METRIC DIMENSION OF CERTAIN FAMILIES OF GRAPHS"],"references":["348463901_Edge_metric_dimension_of_some_classes_of_circulant_graphs","336867828_On_the_edge_metric_dimension_of_convex_polytopes_and_its_related_graphs","336263984_Edge_Metric_Dimension_of_Some_Generalized_Petersen_Graphs","296848328_Uniquely_identifying_the_edges_of_a_graph_The_edge_metric_dimension","284033861_More_on_distance_of_line_graphs","270681723_R-Sets_and_Metric_Dimension_of_Necklace_Graphs","266552445_Minimal_doubly_resolving_sets_and_the_strong_metric_dimension_of_Hamming_graphs","334860639_Edge_Metric_Dimension_of_Some_Graph_Operations","309738350_On_Edge_Dimension_of_a_Graph","267067206_The_theory_and_applications_of_resolvability_in_graphs_A_survey"]}
