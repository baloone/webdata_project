{"id":"335218866_Against_Computational_Perspectivalism","abstract":"Computational perspectivalism has been recently proposed as an alternative to mainstream accounts of physical computation, and especially to the teleologically-based mechanistic view. It takes physical computation to be partly dependent on explanatory perspectives, and eschews appeal to teleology in helping individuate computational systems. I assess several varieties of computational perspectivalism, showing that they either collapse into existing non-perspectival views; or end up with unsatisfactory or implausible accounts of physical computation. Computational perspectivalism fails therefore to be a compelling alternative to perspective-independent theories of computation in physical systems. I conclude that a teleologically-based, non-perspectival mechanistic account of physical computation is to be preferred.","authors":["Dimitri Coelho Mollo"],"meta":["August 2019The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science","DOI:10.1093/bjps/axz036"],"references":["330678501_Computation_in_Physical_Systems_A_Normative_Mapping_Account","327239565_Computing_Mechanisms_Without_Proper_Functions","326802691_A_unified_mechanistic_account_of_teleological_functions_for_psychology_and_neuroscience","315499744_Functional_individuation_mechanistic_implementation_the_proper_way_of_seeing_the_mechanistic_view_of_concrete_computation","303899866_Four_Kinds_of_Perspectival_Truth","290209798_The_Influence_of_Cast_Shadows_on_the_Detection_of_Three-Dimensional_Curved_Contour_Structure","277935111_How_do_causes_depend_on_us_The_many_faces_of_perspectivalism","272375442_Models_Mechanisms_and_Coherence","267706496_Functions_and_Mechanisms_A_Perspectivalist_View","240548010_Thinking_About_Mechanisms","226006219_Selected_effects_and_causal_role_functions_in_the_brain_The_case_for_an_etiological_approach_to_neuroscience","19780919_Network_model_of_shape-from-shading_Neural_function_arises_from_both_receptive_and_projective_fields","332766217_Miscomputation_in_Computational_Psychiatry","330673897_Mechanistic_Computational_Individuation_without_Biting_the_Bullet","327971243_Are_There_Teleological_Functions_to_Compute","327118871_Cognitive_computational_neuroscience","321705135_A_Mark_of_the_Mental_In_Defense_of_Informational_Teleosemantics","320538317_Functions_Selection_and_mechanisms","313400676_Normalization_as_a_canonical_neural_computation","304403411_Individuation_without_Representation","304340961_New_perspectives_on_artifactual_and_biological_functions","290494978_The_Varieties_of_Computation_A_Reply","288793115_Algorithms_implemented_in_space_and_time","284265016_A_Problem_for_the_Mechanistic_Account_of_Computation","276034303_What_Might_Cognition_Be_if_Not_Computation","275872477_Wright_on_Functions","269183829_Computational_Psychiatry","259726622_The_Functional_Sense_of_Mechanism","249081094_Functions_as_Selected_Effects_The_Conceptual_Analyst's_Defense","246271394_Functions_Consensus_Without_Unity","239997218_Fodor's_Guide_to_Mental_Representation_The_Intelligent_Auntie's_VadeMecum","238374119_What_is_Computer_Science_About","236880605_Explaining_the_Computational_Mind","223634453_One_phenomenon_many_models_Inconsistency_and_complementarity","222396246_Perspectivism_inconsistent_models_and_contrastive_explanation","220693426_Artificial_Intelligence_The_Very_Idea","220547521_The_Rediscovery_of_the_Mind","49552921_Representation_and_Reality","2463949_A_Computational_Foundation_for_the_Study_of_Cognition"]}
