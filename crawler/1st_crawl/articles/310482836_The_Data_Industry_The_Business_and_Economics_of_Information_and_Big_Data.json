This book is written to provide an introduction of this new industry to the field of economics. It is among the first books on this topic. The data industry ranges widely. Any domain (or field) can be called a “data industry” if it has a fundamental feature: the use of data technologies. This book (1) explains data resources; (2) introduces the data asset; (3) defines a data industry chain; (4) enumerates data enterprises’ business models and operating model, as well as a mode of industrial development for the data industry; (5) describes five types of enterprise agglomeration, and multiple industrial cluster effects; and (6) provides a discussion on the establishment and development of data industry related laws and regulations.","authors":["Chunlei Tang"],"meta":["June 2016","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Inc.Editor: Jon GurstelleISBN: 978-1-119-13840-2"],"references":["324391525_Regional_Advantage_Culture_and_Competition_in_Silicon_Valley_and_Route_128","313134420_The_Competitive_Advantage_of_Nations","313049744_The_virtual_corporation","312995931_The_Right_to_Privacy","312443414_Location_clusters_and_the_'new'_microeconomics_of_competition","276010068_Scale_and_Scope_The_Dynamics_of_Industrial_Capitalism","273059432_Triumph_of_the_City_How_Our_Greatest_Invention_Makes_Us_Richer_Smarter_Greener_Healthier_and_Hap_pier","263568019_Delete_The_Virtue_of_Forgetting_in_the_Digital_Age","248444762_The_Long_Tail_-_Why_the_Future_of_Business_is_Selling_Less_of_More","248295976_Value_Creation_in_eBusiness","235627183_The_Geography_of_Violence_Alcohol_Outlets_and_Drug_Arrests_in_Boston","242460895_Small_Is_Beautiful_Economics_As_If_People_Mattered","235409335_Competitive_Advantage_Creating_and_Sustaining_Superior_Performance","235362849_A_Diffusion_of_Innovations","227642813_Toward_a_Synthesis_of_the_Resource-Based_and_Dynamic-Capability_Views_of_Rent_Creation"]}
