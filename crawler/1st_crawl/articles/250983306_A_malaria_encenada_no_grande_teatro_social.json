{"id":"250983306_A_malaria_encenada_no_grande_teatro_social","abstract":"This paper deals with the conflicts that permeated the history of malaria from the 17th century on. It shows that in many instances  due to the enormous importance of malaria as a major enemy of mankind  problems purely of medical nature extrapolated the frontiers of medicine and involved large social segments As a consequence, medical differences of opinion were transferred to the public in a distorted and amplified fashion. This generated passionate and partisan disputes of religious, political, social and even racial nature. Thus, throughout the history of malaria, we assist to a self-serving manipulation of facts by antagonistic groups interested in the preservation of their beliefs and dogmas rather than in the solving of the real medical problems posed by malaria.","authors":["Erney Plessmann Camargo"],"meta":["August 1995Estudos Avançados 9(24)","DOI:10.1590/S0103-40141995000200010"],"references":["326465159_Diagnosis_treatment_and_prophylaxis_of_malaria_in_the_Czech_Republic","269444924_Mosquitoes_Malaria_and_Man_A_History_of_the_Hostilities_Since_1880","37480908_Tropical_diseases"]}
