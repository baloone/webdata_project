{"id":"238950058_Outlying_Property_Detection_with_Numerical_Attributes","abstract":"The outlying property detection problem is the problem of discovering the\nproperties distinguishing a given object, known in advance to be an outlier in\na database, from the other database objects. In this paper, we analyze the\nproblem within a context where numerical attributes are taken into account,\nwhich represents a relevant case left open in the literature. We introduce a\nmeasure to quantify the degree the outlierness of an object, which is\nassociated with the relative likelihood of the value, compared to the to the\nrelative likelihood of other objects in the database. As a major contribution,\nwe present an efficient algorithm to compute the outlierness relative to\nsignificant subsets of the data. The latter subsets are characterized in a\n\"rule-based\" fashion, and hence the basis for the underlying explanation of the\noutlierness.","authors":["Fabrizio Angiulli","Fabio Fassetti","Luigi Palopoli","Giuseppe Manco"],"meta":["January 2017Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery 31(1)","DOI:10.1007/s10618-016-0458-x","SourcearXiv"],"references":["273306927_Mining_outlying_aspects_on_numeric_data","260910042_Identification_of_high_shears_and_compressive_discontinuities_in_the_inner_heliosphere","327944900_Direct_Robust_Matrix_Factorization_for_Anomaly_Detection","306157267_Describing_univariate_distributions","294281375_Local_Outlier_Detection_with_Interpretation","280292900_DOLPHIN","272825857_UCI_Machine_Learning_Repository","271556514_Explaining_Outliers_by_Subspace_Separability","269306364_Discriminative_features_for_identifying_and_interpreting_outliers","266595260_Outlier_Analysis","227244146_Fast_mining_of_distance-based_outliers_in_high-dimensional_datasets","224384174_Isolation_Forest","247088416_Outliers_In_Statistical_Data","243048255_Outlier_detection_by_robust_principal_component_analysis","221995817_Maximum_Likelihood_from_Incomplete_Data_Via_EM_Algorithm"]}
