One would expect the same phenomenon to be true in software development. Meanwhile, a typical software engineering course fails to teach its students many of the skills needed in software development organizations. Because lectures and class projects alone cannot adequately teach about the software process, we have used a pair of games in which the process is simulated, giving students an opportunity to practice it firsthand. SimSE is an educational computer simulation of software process and MO- SEProcess is a Multiplayer Online Software Engineering Process game based on SimSE.","authors":["Qing Zhu","Tao Wang","Shenglong Tan"],"meta":["August 2007","DOI:10.1109/ICNC.2007.159"],"references":["221390991_Adapting_Game_Technology_to_Support_Individual_and_Organizational_Learning","220942759_SIMSE_An_Interactive_Simulation_Game_for_Software_Engineering_Education","3247893_Educating_experienced_IT_professionals_by_addressing_industry's_needs","221368184_What_Leading_Practitioners_Say_Should_be_Emphasized_in_Students'_Software_Engineering_Projects","3923412_An_Analysis_Of_The_Gap_Between_The_Knowledge_And_Skills_Learned_In_Academic_Software_Engineering_Course_Projects_And_Those_Required_In_Real_Projects","3247906_Developing_Software_Engineers_at_the_C-130J_Software_Factory"]}
