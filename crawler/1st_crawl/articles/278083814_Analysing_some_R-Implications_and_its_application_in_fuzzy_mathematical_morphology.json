{"id":"278083814_Analysing_some_R-Implications_and_its_application_in_fuzzy_mathematical_morphology","abstract":"The fuzzy mathematical morphology extends the binary morphological operators to gray-scale and coloured images using concepts of fuzzy logic. To define the morphological operators of fuzzy erosion and dilatation it is used the implications and conjunctions respectively. This work presents an analysis of some R-implications to verify if the pairs of implications and T-norms (conjunctions) were adjunctions. It was used a fuzzy application developed in the Matlab for implementation and tests with the respectively results.","authors":["Alexsandra Andrade","Roque Mendes Prado Trindade","Deise Santana Maia","Regivan H N Santiago"],"meta":["January 2014Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems 27(1):201-209","DOI:10.3233/IFS-130989"],"references":[]}
