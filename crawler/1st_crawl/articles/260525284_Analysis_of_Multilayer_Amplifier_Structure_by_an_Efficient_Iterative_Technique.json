{"id":"260525284_Analysis_of_Multilayer_Amplifier_Structure_by_an_Efficient_Iterative_Technique","abstract":"A new compact microwave amplifier structure using an iterative technique based on the wave concept iterative procedure (WCIP) is presented. This new multilayer structure is composed of five planar interfaces of strip lines. The technique used to model this structure provides a mixed resolution in modal and spatial domain. By taking the best advantage of each resolution domain, a lower computing time is obtained. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that a near field amplification technique is achievable and the WCIP is suitable to electromagnetic analysis of this kind of structure. The numerical results show 13.4 dB gain at 5.6 GHz.","authors":["A. Serres","Georgina K. F.
