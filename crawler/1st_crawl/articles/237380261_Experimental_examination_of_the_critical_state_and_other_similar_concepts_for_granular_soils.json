{"id":"237380261_Experimental_examination_of_the_critical_state_and_other_similar_concepts_for_granular_soils","abstract":"Measuring the critical state parameters of dense granular soil by drained triaxial tests is problematic, as significant nonhomogeneous deformations can develop prior to approaching a critical state. This leads to further questions on the verification of the critical state concept for granular soils. In this study a new testing method, which enables the critical state of dense sand to be measured in the homogeneous deformation region, was adopted to measure the critical state of dense sand and to examine the critical state concept. A series of experiments was carried out to measure the critical state for dense, medium dense, and loose sand. The test results show that although a unique critical state curve may exist, the critical state friction angle is not constant but stress level dependent. The other similar concepts, namely, the phase transformation state, the characteristic state, and the steady state, were also examined, and the relationships among these states were established. Key words : critical state, granular soils, stress path, stressâ€“strain behaviour, triaxial test.","authors":["Jian Chu"],"meta":["January 2011Canadian Geotechnical Journal 32(6):1065-1075","DOI:10.1139/t95-104"],"references":["295834397_Liquefaction_of_Sands","292700914_Stress_strain_aspects_of_cohesionless_soils_under_cyclic_and_transient_loading_Proceedings_of_the_International_Symposium_on_Soils_under_cyclic_and_transient_loading","275027554_Critical_State_Soil_Mechanics","247051718_On_The_Yielding_of_Soils","245410543_The_critical_state_of_sand","237378326_The_behaviour_of_very_loose_sand_in_the_triaxial_compression_test_Discussion","237377775_Constant-volume_friction_angle_of_granular_materials","304827077_Undrained_deformation_and_liquefaction_of_sand_under_cyclic_stress_J","297809976_Some_aspects_of_the_behaviour_of_soils_in_simple_shear","283956769_The_Steady_State_of_Deformation","274428917_Undrained_Deformation_and_Liquefaction_of_Sand_Under_Cyclic_Stresses","248878415_Strain-Softening_Behavior_of_Granular_Soil_in_Strain-Path_Testing","248878081_Minimum_Undrained_Strength_of_Two_Sands","245410881_The_behaviour_of_normally_consolidated_clay_as_observed_in_undrained_direct_shear_tests","245410853_Discussion_The_critical_state_of_sands","245410646_Asymptotic_behaviour_of_a_granular_soil_in_strain_path_testing","245402942_On_the_Measurement_of_Critical_State_Parameters_of_Dense_Granular_Soils","239410741_Behavior_of_dry_sand_tested_in_a_large_triaxial_apparatus","239409282_A_Technique_for_Reducing_Membrane_Penetration_and_Bedding_Errors","239166678_Recent_Results_of_Triaxial_Tests_with_Granular_Materials","237378676_Measurement_of_soil_strength_in_simple_shear_tests_Reply","37407297_Soil_Mechanics_SI_version","35813076_The_behavior_of_soils_in_simple_shear_apparatus"]}
