{"id":"338100271_When_robotics_met_fluidics","abstract":"High-throughput fluidic technologies have increased the speed and accuracy of fluid processing to the extent that unlocking further gains will require replacing the human operator with a robotic counterpart. Recent advances in chemistry and biology, such as gene editing, have further exacerbated the need for smart, high-throughput experimentation. A growing number of innovations at the intersection of robotics and fluidics illustrate the tremendous opportunity in achieving fully self-driving fluid systems. We envision that the fields of synthetic chemistry and synthetic biology will be the first beneficiaries of AI-directed robotic and fluidic systems, and largely fall within two modalities: complex integrated centralized facilities that produce data, and distributed systems that synthesize products and conduct disease surveillance.","authors":["Junjie Zhong","Jason Riordon","Tony C Wu","Harrison
