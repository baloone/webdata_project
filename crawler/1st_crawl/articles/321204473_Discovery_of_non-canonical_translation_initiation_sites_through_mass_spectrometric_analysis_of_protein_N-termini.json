{"id":"321204473_Discovery_of_non-canonical_translation_initiation_sites_through_mass_spectrometric_analysis_of_protein_N-termini","abstract":"Translation initiation generally occurs at AUG codons in eukaryotes although it has been shown that non-AUG or non-canonical translation initiation can also occur. However, the evidence for non-canonical translation initiation sites (TISs) is largely indirect and based on ribosome profiling studies. Here, using a strategy specifically designed to enrich N-termini of proteins, we demonstrate that many human proteins are translated at non-canonical TISs. The large majority of TISs that mapped to 5' untranslated regions were non-canonical and led to N-terminal extension of annotated proteins or translation of upstream small open reading frames (uORF). It has been controversial whether the amino acid corresponding to the start codon is incorporated at TIS or methionine is still incorporated. We found that methionine was incorporated at almost all non-canonical TISs identified in this study. Comparison of the TISs determined through mass spectrometry with ribosome profiling data revealed that about two-thirds of the novel annotations were indeed supported by the available ribosome profiling data. Sequence conservation across species and a higher abundance of non-canonical TISs than canonical ones in some cases suggests that the non-canonical TISs can have biological functions. Overall, this study provides evidence of protein translation initiation at non-canonical TISs and argues that further studies are required for elucidation of functional implications of such non-canonical translation initiation.","authors":["Chan-Hyun Na","Mustafa A Barbhuiya","Min-Sik Kim","Steven Verbruggen"],"meta":["November 2017Genome Research 28(1):gr.226050.117","DOI:10.1101/gr.226050.117"],"references":["317188830_EIF1_modulates_the_recognition_of_suboptimal_translation_initiation_sites_and_steers_gene_expression_via_uORFs","316359033_N-terminal_Proteomics_Assisted_Profiling_of_the_Unexplored_Translation_Initiation_Landscape_in_Arabidopsis_thaliana","310745236_Plastid_Nucleotide-resolution_analysis_of_next-generation_sequencing_and_genomics_data","269629395_PROTEOFORMER_deep_proteome_coverage_through_ribosome_profiling_and_MS_integration","265093729_Ribosome_Profiling_Reveals_Pervasive_Translation_Outside_of_Annotated_Protein-Coding_Genes","262770996_A_draft_map_of_the_human_proteome","260761105_N-terminal_Proteomics_and_Ribosome_Profiling_Provide_a_Comprehensive_View_of_the_Alternative_Translation_Initiation_Landscape_in_Mice_and_Men","258349907_TISdb_A_database_for_alternative_translation_initiation_in_mammalian_cells","258253830_GWIPS-viz_Development_of_a_ribo-seq_genome_browser","250925487_New_Universal_Rules_of_Eukaryotic_Translation_Initiation_Fidelity","235690130_Deep_Proteome_Coverage_Based_on_Ribosome_Profiling_Aids_Mass_Spectrometry-based_Protein_and_Peptide_Discovery_and_Provides_Evidence_of_Alternative_Translation_Products_and_Near-cognate_Translation_Ini","232721328_STAR_ultrafast_universal_RNA-seq_aligner","230748978_Global_mapping_of_translation_initiation_sites_in_mammalian_cells_at_single-nucleotide_resolution","51708585_Fast_scalable_generation_of_high-quality_protein_multiple_sequence_alignments_using_Clustal_Omega","51681474_Identifying_and_quantifying_proteolytic_events_and_the_natural_N_terminome_by_terminal_amine_isotopic_labeling_of_substrates","41809135_Isotopic_labeling_of_terminal_amines_in_complex_samples_identifies_protein_N-termini_and_protease_cleavage_products","40696209_CUG_Start_Codon_Generates_ThioredoxinGlutathione_Reductase_Isoforms_in_Mouse_Testes","24004932_Genome-Wide_Analysis_In_Vivo_of_Translation_with_Nucleotide_Resolution_Using_Ribosome_Profiling","8207454_Unanticipated_Antigens_Translation_Initiation_at_CUG_with_Leucine","6826727_The_Proteomics_of_N-terminal_Methionine_Cleavage","6192970_Translation_initiation_site_prediction_on_a_genomic_scale_Beauty_in_simplicity","312206115_Translation_from_unconventional_5'_start_sites_drives_tumour_initiation","273205111_Molecular_Cellular_and_Physiological_Significance_of_N-Terminal_Acetylation","269338947_Quantitative_profiling_of_initiating_ribosomes_in_vivo","260369577_Annotating_N_Termini_for_the_Human_Proteome_Project_N_Termini_and_Na-Acetylation_Status_Differentiate_Stable_Cleaved_Protein_Species_from_Degradation_Remnants_in_the_Human_Erythrocyte_Proteome","260116150_The_Scanning_Mechanism_of_Eukaryotic_Translation_Initiation","228089264_Leucine-tRNA_Initiates_at_CUG_Start_Codons_for_Protein_Synthesis_and_Presentation_by_MHC_Class_I","51772526_Ribosome_Profiling_of_Mouse_Embryonic_Stem_Cells_Reveals_the_Complexity_and_Dynamics_of_Mammalian_Proteomes","44647853_Protein_N-Terminal_Processing_Substrate_Specificity_of_Escherichia_coli_and_Human_Methionine_Aminopeptidases","40690800_An_Overview_of_Label-Free_Quantitation_Methods_in_Proteomics_by_Mass_Spectrometry","8533922_WebLogo_a_Sequence_Logo_Generator"]}
