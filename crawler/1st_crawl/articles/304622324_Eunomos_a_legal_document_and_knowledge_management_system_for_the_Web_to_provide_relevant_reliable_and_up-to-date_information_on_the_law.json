{"id":"304622324_Eunomos_a_legal_document_and_knowledge_management_system_for_the_Web_to_provide_relevant_reliable_and_up-to-date_information_on_the_law","abstract":"This paper describes the Eunomos software, an advanced legal document and knowledge management system, based on legislative XML and ontologies. We describe the challenges of legal research in an increasingly complex, multi-level and multi-lingual world and how the Eunomos software helps users cut through the information overload to get the legal information they need in an organized and structured way and keep track of the state of the relevant law on any given topic. Using NLP tools to semi-automate the lower-skill tasks makes this ambitious project a realistic commercial prospect as it helps keep costs down while at the same time allowing greater coverage. We describe the core system from workflow and technical perspectives, and discuss applications of the system for various user groups.","authors":["Guido Boella","Luigi Di Caro","Llio Humphreys","Livio Robaldo"],"meta":["September 2016Artificial Intelligence and Law 24(3)","DOI:10.1007/s10506-016-9184-3"],"references":["316049340_Combining_InputOutput_Logic_and_Reification_for_Representing_Real-World_Obligations","302557703_Article_Type_of_nosql_databases_and_its_comparison_with_relational_databases","266042833_What's_in_an_Interchange_Standard_for_Legislative_XML","319393820_WordNet_An_Electronic_Lexical_Database","312538118_Support-vector_networks","286475704_Eunomos_A_Legal_Document_and_Knowledge_Management_System_for_Regulatory_Compliance","285278428_Text_Categorization_with_Support_Vector_Machines_Learning_with_Many_Relevant_Features","278754482_Handbook_of_Deontic_Logic_and_Normative_Systems","276464810_Workload_matters","271513141_Support_Vector_Networks"]}
