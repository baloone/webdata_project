These predictors were gender, age, precomputational thinking skills, and prior computer science experience.\n\nImplications for practice and/or policy\nDesign a gradual learning curve for beginners so that they can adapt to the course mindset and framework.\nAssure students who are frustrated in the beginning of the course that once they adapt to the course mindset, their lack of background knowledge will not define their future experience and persistence.\nAssisted with the auto‐adaptive feedback features, multiple trials in the course assignment can be an engaging and rewarding experience.\nMOOCs should develop pedagogies that explicitly encourage student to use a trial‐and‐error strategy, testing different scenarios and experimenting with different solutions, to make the most use of auto‐adaptive feedback features.\nMOOC educators should not only take a growth perspective towards students' knowledge and skill development, but also a growth perspective towards students' persistence: As students overcome the initial hurdles, their resilience grows stronger.","authors":["Chen Chen","Gerhard Sonnert","Philip M Sadler","David"],"meta":["October 2020Journal of Computer Assisted Learning 36(6)","DOI:10.1111/jcal.12427"],"references":["338022621_The_impact_of_student_misconceptions_on_student_persistence_in_a_MOOC","329065281_The_effects_of_first_programming_language_on_college_students'_computing_attitude_and_achievement_a_comparison_of_graphical_and_textual_languages","324038127_Demographic_data_of_MOOC_learners_Can_alternative_survey_deliveries_improve_current_understandings","323948708_Effectiveness_of_learning_in_online_academic_courses_compared_with_face-to-face_courses_in_higher_education","323942824_Learner_support_in_MOOCs_Identifying_variables_linked_to_completion","323381893_Learning_Engagement_and_Persistence_in_Massive_Open_Online_Courses_MOOCS","322544342_A_systematic_review_of_research_methods_and_topics_of_the_empirical_MOOC_literature_2014-2016","322392196_Examination_of_relationships_among_students'_self-determination_technology_acceptance_satisfaction_and_continuance_intention_to_use_K-MOOCs","321770377_Motivating_factors_of_MOOC_completers_Comparing_between_university-affiliated_students_and_general_participants","321088046_Gender_Disparities_in_Science_Dropout_Productivity_Collaborations_and_Success_of_Male_and_Female_Computer_Scientists","320027235_Types_of_Participant_Behavior_in_a_Massive_Open_Online_Course","319192383_Eliciting_the_challenges_and_opportunities_organizations_face_when_delivering_open_online_education_A_group-concept_mapping_study","319030263_Persistence_Patterns_in_Massive_Open_Online_Courses_MOOCs","317953663_Self-Efficacy_Toward_a_Unifying_Theory_of_Behavioral_Change","317160209_Learnable_Programming_Blocks_and_Beyond"]}
