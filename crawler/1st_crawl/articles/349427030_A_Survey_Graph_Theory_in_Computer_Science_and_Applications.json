{"id":"349427030_A_Survey_Graph_Theory_in_Computer_Science_and_Applications","abstract":"The field of mathematics plays a vital role in various field. One of the important areas in mathematics is graph theory, which is used in structural models. This structural arrangements of various objects or technologies lead to new inventions and modifications in the existing environment for enhancement in those fields. The field graph theory started its journey from the problem of Koneisberg bridge in 1735. This paper gives an overview of the applications of graph theory in heterogeneous fields to some extent but mainly focuses on the computer science applications that uses graph theoretical concepts. Various papers based on graph theory have been studied related to scheduling concepts, computer science and its applications later an overview has been presented here.","authors":["N.
