One of the important components of the educational and methodical work of a teacher who teaches computer science to younger students is the quality control of the acquired system of knowledge of schoolchildren, which involves experimental pedagogical activity. Such experimental pedagogical activities include pedagogical experiments, the results of which are processed and analyzed using mathematical methods. Pedagogical measurements allow to justify the effectiveness of the implemented teaching methodology. Methodology. Pedagogical measurements are carried out in pedagogical research aimed at improving the content, methods, forms and means of teaching computer science to younger students using didactic games. The pedagogical experiment itself includes ascertaining, searching, forming and controlling stages. The analysis of the results of pedagogical measurements aimed at identifying the quality of the obtained knowledge in computer science of younger students can be effectively carried out using mathematical and statistical methods. Results. The conducted pedagogical measurements allow to draw a conclusion about how much younger students have subject knowledge in computer science, which is taught using didactic games; to identify the level of their worldview, logical thinking. Conclusion. Experimental pedagogical activity of the teacher in the process of teaching computer science to younger students allows to identify the effectiveness of such training, the level of subject knowledge of students. Analysis of the results of pedagogical measurements allows, if necessary, to correct the methodology and content of training in computer science.","authors":["Viktor S. Kornilov","Svetlana V.
