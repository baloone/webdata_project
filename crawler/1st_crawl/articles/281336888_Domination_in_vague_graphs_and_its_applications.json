{"id":"281336888_Domination_in_vague_graphs_and_its_applications","abstract":"The concept of vague graph introduced by Ramakrishna in [8]. The main purpose of this paper is to introduce\nthe concepts of cardinality, dominating set, independent set, total dominating number and independent dominating number of a vague graph. The notion of irredundance number of a vague graph is discussed, too. Finally we give an application of domination in vague graphs.","authors":["Rajabali Borzooei","Hossein Rashmanlou"],"meta":["August 2015Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems 29(5)","DOI:10.3233/IFS-151671","Project: Generalization of fuzzy graphs"],"references":["280067009_Complete_interval-valued_fuzzy_graphs","275605693_New_concepts_of_fuzzy_planar_graph","259692489_Vague_hypergraphs","236943359_Fuzzy_k_-Competition_Graphs_and_p_-Competition_Fuzzy_Graphs","236623469_Domination_in_interval-valued_fuzzy_graphs","276849299_A_study_on_bipolar_fuzzy_graphs","265201014_Vague_Graphs","235943829_Vague_Sets","223593669_Zadeh_LA_Similarity_Relations_and_Fuzzy_Orderings_Information_Sciences_3_177-200","222439366_Fuzzy_Sets","222180998_Is_there_a_need_for_fuzzy_logic_Inf_Sci","220646064_Domination_in_fuzzy_graphs_-_I"]}
