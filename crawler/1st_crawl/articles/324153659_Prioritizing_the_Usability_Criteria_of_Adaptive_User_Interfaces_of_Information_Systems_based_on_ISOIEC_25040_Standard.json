{"id":"324153659_Prioritizing_the_Usability_Criteria_of_Adaptive_User_Interfaces_of_Information_Systems_based_on_ISOIEC_25040_Standard","abstract":"Usability is a major concern within adaptive user interfaces. It presents a combination of different criteria. The impact of each usability criterion may vary from one layer to another during the usability evaluation of adaptive user interfaces. On that basis, one question that arises is: “What are the priority levels of usability criteria that need to be assessed in individual layers and in the whole adaptive system?\" This paper presents possible directions to address this question by identifying the priorities of usability criteria to be assessed in the adaptive user interfaces of information systems, considering the ISO/IEC 25040 standard. These priorities are calculated using a multi-criteria decision analysis method, namely the Analytic Hierarchy Process. The proposed multi-criteria decision approach provides guidance to better evaluate adaptive user interfaces. An adaptive information system in the field of transport is presented in order to validate and illustrate our approach.","authors":["Amira Dhouib","Abdelwaheb Trabelsi","Christophe Kolski","Mahmoud Neji"],"meta":["August 2017Ingénierie des Systèmes D Information 22(4):107-128","DOI:10.3166/ISI.22.4.107-128"],"references":["305869646_A_classification_and_comparison_of_usability_evaluation_methods_for_interactive_adaptive_systems","281968723_Design_and_Usability_Evaluation_of_Adaptive_E-learning_Systems_based_on_Learner_Knowledge_and_Learning_Style","265858510_Towards_an_Evaluation_of_Graphical_User_Interfaces_Aesthetics_based_on_Metrics","254304995_Evaluation_by_simulation_to_optimise_information_systems'_personalisation_quality_in_logistics","250883677_Fourth_Workshop_on_the_Evaluation_of_Adaptive_Systems","228772661_Layered_evaluation_of_adaptive_learning_systems","228669478_Integration_of_Traffic_Management_and_Traveller_Information_Systems_Basic_Principles_and_Case_Study_in_Intermodal_Transport_System_Management","225591558_A_Decomposition_Model_for_the_Layered_Evaluation_of_Interactive_Adaptive_Systems","223881856_The_usability_analysis_with_heuristic_evaluation_and_analytic_hierarchy_process","221267662_GALE_A_highly_eXtensible_adaptive_hypermedia_engine","220800390_Usability_Engineering_for_the_Adaptive_Web","220468040_The_evaluation_of_adaptive_and_personalised_information_retrieval_systems_A_review","220439022_Modelisation_conceptuelle_des_IHM_Une_approche_globale_s'appuyant_sur_les_processus_metier","220374946_Integrating_Adaptive_Educational_Content_into_Different_Courses_and_Curricula","220254402_Methods_and_techniques_for_the_evaluation_of_user-adaptive_systems","220254312_User-centered_evaluation_of_adaptive_and_adaptable_systems_A_literature_review","220116360_Layered_evaluation_of_interactive_adaptive_systems_Framework_and_formative_methods","2484294_Adaptive_Systems_a_solution_to_usability_problems","306925272_An_approach_for_the_selection_of_evaluation_methods_for_interactive_adaptive_systems_using_analytic_hierarchy_process","302074306_Usability_and_Effectiveness_Evaluation_of_Adaptivity_in_E-Learning_Systems","300920626_The_Evaluation_of_Adaptive_Systems","295378689_Human-Computer_Interactions_in_Transport","286734717_Layered_Evaluation_for_Data_Discovery_and_Recommendation_Systems_An_Initial_Set_of_Principles","260282595_Adaptive_Interfaces_and_Agents","258138648_An_Application_of_the_Analytic_Hierarchy_Process_A_Rank-Ordering_of_Computer_Interfaces","243782065_Guide_ergono-mique_de_la_presentation_des_applications_hautement_in-teractives","242375192_Usability_engineering_at_a_discount","228628807_Decision_making_with_the_Analytic_Hierarchy_Process","226777321_Layered_Evaluation_of_Adaptive_Applications_and_Services","225197198_Measuring_usability_as_quality_of_use","223594715_A_structured_methodology_for_comparative_evaluation_of_user_interface_designs_using_usability_criteria_and_measures","223398625_Weapon_selection_using_the_AHP_and_TOPSIS_methods_under_fuzzy_environment","222703391_Steps_to_take_before_intelligent_user_interfaces_become_real","221261051_User_Modeling_Meets_Usability_Goals","220605070_Understanding_and_Dealing_With_Usability_Side_Effects_of_Intelligent_Processing","49607357_Analytic_Hierarchy_Process_AHP_for_a_Power_Transmission_Industry_to_Vendor_Selection_Decisions"]}
