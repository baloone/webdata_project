{"id":"266328450_A_user-centric_PKI_based-protocol_to_manage_FC_digital_identities","abstract":"The proliferation of e-services (e.g. e-commerce, e-health, e-government) within the emerging digital Identity Management Systems make Internet an undeniable convenient and powerful tool for users. However in this environment, users are required to manage several digital identities and a great number of personal data. As such, simplification of users' involvement is highly needed while increasing the users' confidence, and guaranteeing security. This paper proposes a low-cost authentication solution which leads to a reduction of users' identities, even across several circles of trust, while maintaining high-level security. This solution is suitable for FCÂ², a platform dedicated to manage digital identities within circles of trust. Key words: Identity management system, public key infrastructure, federated identity, circle of trust, digital identity, security.","authors":["Samia Bouzefrane","Khaled Garri","Pascal Thoniel"],"meta":["January 2011International Journal of Computer Science Issues 8(1)"],"references":["267836659_Federation_of_Circles_of_Trust_and_Secure_Usage_of_Digital_Identity","224374672_Identity_Management_Systems_and_Interoperability_in_a_Heterogeneous_Environment","221190736_A_calculus_of_trust_and_its_application_to_PKI_and_identity_management","3633816_Decentralized_Trust_Management","3282733_Overview_of_PKI_trust_models","2454138_Trust_Models_and_Management_in_Public-Key_Infrastructures","2324962_Modelling_a_Public-Key_Infrastructure"]}
