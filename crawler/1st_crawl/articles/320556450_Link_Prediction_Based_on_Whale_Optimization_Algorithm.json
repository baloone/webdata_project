{"id":"320556450_Link_Prediction_Based_on_Whale_Optimization_Algorithm","abstract":"Link prediction problem has a wide variety of useful applications in diverse fields. For example, in bio-informatics, such as protein-protein interaction metabolic and diseases-gene networks, there are links between nodes, which indicate they have an interaction relationship. This paper presents a possible solution to the well known link prediction problem using a Whale Optimization algorithm (WOA), which is considered as one of the\nrecent optimization algorithms. The link prediction problem is formulated as an optimization problem to predict the links in any type of the networks. Experimental results of the proposed algorithm (WOA-LP) on a number of real networks are good\nevidence that the proposed approach can enhance the link prediction accuracy.","authors":["Reham Barham","Ibrahim Aljarah"],"meta":["October 2017","DOI:10.1109/ICTCS.2017.41","Conference: The International Conference on new Trends in Computing Sciences (ICTCS2017)At: Amman, Jordan"],"references":["316627401_Enhancing_the_Arabic_Sentiment_Analysis_Using_Different_Preprocessing_Operators","310662777_Optimizing_connection_weights_in_neural_networks_using_the_whale_optimization_algorithm","303811249_A_Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis_for_Cloud_Providers_A_Case_Study_of_Azure_vs_AWS","221612005_Scalable_proximity_estimation_and_link_prediction_in_online_social_networks","220876141_Link_Prediction_in_Social_Networks_Using_Computationally_Efficient_Topological_Features","220867187_Particle_Swarm_for_the_Traveling_Salesman_Problem","296635903_The_Whale_Optimization_Algorithm","271405445_A_link_prediction_algorithm_based_on_ant_colony_optimization","222689634_Particle_swarm_optimization-based_algorithms_for_TSP_and_generalized_TSP","221397656_A_Link_Prediction_Approach_to_Recommendations_in_Large-Scale_User-Generated_Content_Systems"]}
