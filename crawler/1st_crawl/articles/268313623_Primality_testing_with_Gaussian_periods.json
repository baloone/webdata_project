{"id":"268313623_Primality_testing_with_Gaussian_periods","abstract":"It was recognized in the mid-eighties, that several then current primality tests could be formulated in the language of Galois theory for rings. This made it possible to combine those tests for practical purposes. It turns out that the new polynomial time primality test due to Agrawal, Kayal, and Saxena can also be formulated in the Galois theory language. Whether the new formulation will allow the test to be combined with the older tests remains to be seen. It does lead to a primality test with a significantly improved guaranteed run time exponent. In this test, one makes use of Gaussian periods instead of roots of unity. The lecture represents joint work with Carl Pomerance (Bell Labs).","authors":["H.W.jun. Lenstra"],"meta":[],"references":[]}
