{"id":"347301677_DCA-based_algorithms_for_DC_fitting","abstract":"We investigate a nonconvex, nonsmooth optimization approach based on DC (Difference of Convex functions) programming and DCA (DC Algorithm) for the so-called DC fitting problem, which aims to fit a given set of data points by a DC function. The problem is tackled as minimizing the squared Euclidean norm fitting error. It is formulated as a DC program for which a standard DCA scheme is developed. Furthermore, a modified DCA scheme with successive DC decomposition is proposed. These standard/modified versions of DCA are applied for solving the continuous piecewise-linear fitting problem. Numerical experiments on many synthetic and real datasets with small-to-large sizes show the efficiency of our DCA-based approach in comparison with the existing approaches for constructing continuous piecewise-linear models.","authors":["Vinh Thanh Ho","Hoai An Le Thi","Pham Dinh Tao"],"meta":["December 2020Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics 389(1)","DOI:10.1016/j.cam.2020.113353"],"references":["327148651_A_unified_DC_programming_framework_and_efficient_DCA_based_approaches_for_large_scale_batch_reinforcement_learning","312036229_Global_optimization_of_non-convex_piecewise_linear_regression_splines","311222521_Reliably_Learning_the_ReLU_in_Polynomial_Time","309514572_DCA_based_algorithms_for_feature_selection_in_multi-class_support_vector_machine","303687902_Trend_analysis_by_a_piecewise_linear_regression_model_applied_to_surface_air_temperatures_in_Southeastern_Spain_1973-2014","294283188_DC_programming_and_DCA_for_sparse_Fisher_linear_discriminant_analysis","283561927_Mathematical_Programming_for_Piecewise_Linear_Regression_Analysis","227699445_Decomposing_Inventory_Routing_Problems_with_Approximate_Value_Functions","227323091_An_algorithm_for_the_estimation_of_a_regression_function_by_continuous_piecewise_linear_functions","51951010_Multivariate_Convex_Regression_with_Adaptive_Partitioning","3342050_A_New_Initialization_Technique_for_Generalized_Lloyd_Iteration","338080970_DCA_with_Successive_DC_Decomposition_for_Convex_Piecewise-Linear_Fitting","334238492_Group_variable_selection_via_l_p_0_regularization_and_application_to_optimal_scoring","329916418_A_difference_of_convex_optimization_algorithm_for_piecewise_linear_regression","326206343_Accelerated_Difference_of_Convex_functions_Algorithm_and_its_Application_to_Sparse_Binary_Logistic_Regression","322694621_DC_programming_and_DCA_thirty_years_of_developments","321848464_Stochastic_DCA_for_the_Large-sum_of_Non-convex_Functions_Problem_and_its_Application_to_Group_Variable_Selection_in_Classification","321847509_Recent_Advances_in_DC_Programming_and_DCA","320093650_Sparse_Covariance_Matrix_Estimation_by_DCA-Based_Algorithms","313591186_Convex_analysis_approaches_to_DC_programming_Theory_algorithms_and_applications","303095674_DC_programming_and_DCA_for_solving_Brugnano-Casulli_piecewise_linear_systems","301829507_Discrete_optimization_methods_to_fit_piecewise_affine_models_to_data_points","268990581_Convergence_of_convex_functions_and_duality","267111364_Sous-differentiels_d'une_borne_superieure_et_d'une_somme_continue_de_fonctions_convexes","266036918_Algorithms_for_Solving_a_Class_of_Nonconvex_Optimization_Problems_Methods_of_Subgradients","265587896_Convex_analysis_approach_to_dc_programming_Theory_Algorithm_and_Applications","243787523_A_DC_Optimization_Algorithm_for_Solving_the_Trust-Region_Subproblem","243041957_Piecewise_Affine_Functions_and_Polyhedral_Sets","226018041_Convex_piecewise-linear_fitting","225602225_A_Tutorial_on_Geometric_Programming","225263857_The_DC_Difference_of_Convex_Functions_Programming_and_DCA_Revisited_with_DC_Models_of_Real_World_Nonconvex_Optimization_Problems","224557816_Fast_Model_Predictive_Control_Using_Online_Optimization","223252619_On_the_Relations_Between_Two_Types_of_Convergence_for_Convex_Functions","220288983_Fitting_piecewise_linear_continuous_functions","220217352_Bankruptcy_forecasting_A_hybrid_approach_using_Fuzzy_c-means_clustering_and_Multivariate_Adaptive_Regression_Splines_MARS","45134679_Optimal_Piecewise_Linear_Income_Taxation","38359483_Multivariate_Adaptive_Regression_Spline","38359473_Multi-Variate_Adaptive_Regression_Splines_with_Discussion","3769523_Piecewise_linear_regression_networks_and_its_application_to_time_series_prediction","2866515_Household_Electricity_Demand_Revisited"]}
