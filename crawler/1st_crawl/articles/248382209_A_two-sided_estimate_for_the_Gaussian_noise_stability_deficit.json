{"id":"248382209_A_two-sided_estimate_for_the_Gaussian_noise_stability_deficit","abstract":"The Gaussian noise-stability of a set A in R^n is defined by S_rho(A) = P (X\nin A and Y in A) where X and Y are standard Gaussian vectors whose correlation\nis rho. Borell's inequality states that for all 0 < rho < 1, among all sets A\nwith a given Gaussian measure, the quantity S_rho(A) is maximized when A is a\nhalf-space.\nWe give a novel short proof of this fact, based on stochastic calculus.\nMoreover, we prove an almost tight, two-sided, dimension-free robustness\nestimate for this inequality: by introducing a new metric to measure the\ndistance between the set A and its corresponding half-space H (namely the\ndistance between the two centroids), we show that the deficit S_rho(H) -\nS_rho(A) can be controlled from both below and above by essentially the same\nfunction of the distance, up to logarithmic factors.\nAs a consequence, we also manage to get the conjectured exponent in the\nrobustness estimate proven by Mossel-Neeman, which uses the total-variation\ndistance as a metric. In the limit rho->1, we get an improved dimension free\nrobustness bound for the Gaussian isoperimetric inequality. Our estimates are\nalso valid for a the more general version of stability where more than two\ncorrelated vectors are considered.","authors":["Ronen Eldan"],"meta":["July 2013Inventiones mathematicae 201(2)","DOI:10.1007/s00222-014-0556-6","SourcearXiv"],"references":["265337668_Skorokhod_Embeddings_via_Stochastic_Flows_on_the_Space_of_Measures","344485097_Recurrence_in_Ergodic_Theory_and_Combinatorial_Number_Theory","288970148_On_the_cases_of_equality_in_Bobkovs_inequality_and_Gaussian_rearrangement_English_summary","266438952_A_Short_Proof_of_the_Gaussian_Isoperimetric_Inequality","265332009_Symetrisation_dans_l'espace_de_Gauss","261468883_Gaussian_Noise_Sensitivity_and_Fourier_Tails","250663204_Extremal_properties_of_half-spaces_for_spherically_invariant_measures","243751601_Recurrence_in_Ergodic_Theory_and_Combinatorial_Number_Theory","242944456_Levy-Gromov's_isometric_inequality_for_an_infinite_dimensional_diffusion_generator","239055914_Isoperimetry_and_Gaussian_analysis"]}
