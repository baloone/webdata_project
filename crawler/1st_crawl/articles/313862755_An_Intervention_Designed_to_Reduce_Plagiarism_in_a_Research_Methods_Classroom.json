{"id":"313862755_An_Intervention_Designed_to_Reduce_Plagiarism_in_a_Research_Methods_Classroom","abstract":"Research has shown that plagiarism is on the increase in higher education. Some state that this is due to poor knowledge rather than intentional cheating. Other researchers explain that plagiarism is on the rise due to increased competitiveness in college and easy access to work that has already been completed. In this study, we show how a 2-hr intervention in a research methods classes, available free online, successfully reduced plagiarism in a sample of undergraduate students registered in a research methods in psychology class across three semesters. The implications of this study are that students need specific training and knowledge, not simply the threat of being caught, before their plagiarism is reduced.","authors":["Rita Obeid","Darryl B.
