{"id":"267672645_The_Framed_Morse_complex_and_its_invariants","abstract":"The invariants of filtered complexes, so-called \"canonical forms\", are introduced. The canonical form of a filtered complex is the partition of the set of critical values (indices) into pairs \"birth-death\" and a separate set representing homology of the complex. The canonical form is obtained by the action of upper-triangular matrices, which reduces the filtered complex to the simplest form. This invariant, ten years later, started to be widely used in applied mathematics under the name \"Persistence Diagrams\" or \"Persistence Bar-codes\". The main result of the paper uses this canonical form invariant to solve the following problem: given a function defined on a neighborhood of boundary of an n-dimensional ball, calculate optimal estimate from below for the number of Morse critical points that any generic extension of the function inside the ball must have.","authors":["Serguei Barannikov"],"meta":["February 1994"],"references":[]}
