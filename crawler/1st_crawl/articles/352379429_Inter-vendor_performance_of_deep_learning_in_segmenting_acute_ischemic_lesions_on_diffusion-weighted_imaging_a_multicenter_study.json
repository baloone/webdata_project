We retrospectively included DWI data of patients with acute ischemic lesions from six centers. Dataset A (n = 2986) and B (n = 3951) included data from Siemens and GE MRI scanners, respectively. The datasets were split into the training (80%), validation (10%), and internal test (10%) sets, and six neuroradiologists created ground-truth masks. Models A and B were the proposed neural networks trained on datasets A and B. The models subsequently fine-tuned across the datasets using their validation data. Another radiologist performed the segmentation on the test sets for comparisons. The median Dice scores of models A and B were 0.858 and 0.857 for the internal tests, which were non-inferior to the radiologistâ€™s performance, but demonstrated lower performance than the radiologist on the external tests. Fine-tuned models A and B achieved median Dice scores of 0.832 and 0.846, which were non-inferior to the radiologist's performance on the external tests. The present work shows that the inter-vendor operability of deep learning for the segmentation of ischemic lesions on DWI might be enhanced via transfer learning; thereby, their clinical applicability and generalizability could be improved.","authors":["Deniz Alis","Mert Yergin","Ceren Alis","Cagdas Topel"],"meta":["June 2021Scientific Reports 11(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-021-91467-x"],"references":["339210386_Efficacy_evaluation_of_2D_3D_U-Net_semantic_segmentation_and_atlas-based_segmentation_of_normal_lungs_excluding_the_trachea_and_main_bronchi","336901239_Guidelines_for_the_Early_Management_of_Patients_With_Acute_Ischemic_Stroke_2019_Update_to_the_2018_Guidelines_for_the_Early_Management_of_Acute_Ischemic_Stroke_A_Guideline_for_Healthcare_Professionals","334631038_Fully_Automatic_Segmentation_of_Acute_Ischemic_Lesions_on_Diffusion-Weighted_Imaging_Using_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_Comparison_with_Conventional_Algorithms","333697425_Big_Data_Approaches_to_Phenotyping_Acute_Ischemic_Stroke_Using_Automated_Lesion_Segmentation_of_Multi-Center_Magnetic_Resonance_Imaging_Data","333506531_Ensemble_of_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_Improves_Automated_Segmentation_of_Acute_Ischemic_Lesions_Using_Multiparametric_Diffusion-Weighted_MRI","349486130_European_Stroke_Organisation_ESO_guidelines_on_intravenous_thrombolysis_for_acute_ischaemic_stroke","348352448_Imaging_of_vascular_cognitive_impairment","341096958_CSNet_A_New_DeepNet_Framework_for_Ischemic_Stroke_Lesion_Segmentation","334428203_Strategies_for_Training_Stain_Invariant_CNNS","333147436_Evaluation_of_Diffusion_Lesion_Volume_Measurements_in_Acute_Ischemic_Stroke_Using_Encoder-Decoder_Convolutional_Network"]}
