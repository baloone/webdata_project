{"id":"316815682_Using_Graph-based_Design_Languages_to_Enhance_the_Creation_of_Virtual_Commissioning_Models","abstract":"‘Industrie 4.0’ based production systems are likely to change the way future products are manufactured. As information technology gains influence on these systems there is a chance of higher flexibility due to decentralized logic and artificial intelligence. All this leads to a higher complexity and also indeterminism is feasible. Therefore simulation technologies will become a mandatory requirement, especially virtual commissioning will get necessary as the amount of software is rising.","authors":["Markus Kiesel","Philipp Klimant","Nicolai Beisheim","Stephan Rudolph"],"meta":["December 2017Procedia CIRP 60:279-283","DOI:10.1016/j.procir.2017.01.047","Project: Engineering Process"],"references":["317012051_Digital_Representation_in_Multicopter_Design_Along_the_Product_Life-cycle","257745437_Realistic_Machine_Simulation_with_Virtual_Reality","245776226_Contraint-based_conceptual_design_and_automated_sensitivity_analysis_for_airship_concept_studies","224332753_AutomationML_-_the_glue_for_seamless_Automation_Engineering","224196884_Description_of_manufacturing_processes_using_AutomationML"]}
