{"id":"343049791_Benchmarking_Continuous_Dynamic_Optimization_Survey_and_Generalized_Test_Suite","abstract":"Dynamic changes are an important and inescapable aspect of many real-world optimization problems. Designing algorithms to find and track desirable solutions while facing challenges of dynamic optimization problems is an active research topic in the field of swarm and evolutionary computation. To evaluate and compare the performance of algorithms, it is imperative to use a suitable benchmark that generates problem instances with different controllable characteristics. In this article, we give a comprehensive review of existing benchmarks and investigate their shortcomings in capturing different problem features. We then propose a highly configurable benchmark suite, the generalized moving peaks benchmark, capable of generating problem instances whose components have a variety of properties, such as different levels of ill-conditioning, variable interactions, shape, and complexity. Moreover, components generated by the proposed benchmark can be highly dynamic with respect to the gradients, heights, optimum locations, condition numbers, shapes, complexities, and variable interactions. Finally, several well-known optimizers and dynamic optimization algorithms are chosen to solve generated problems by the proposed benchmark. The experimental results show the poor performance of the existing methods in facing new challenges posed by the addition of new properties.","authors":["Danial Yazdani","Mohammmad Nabi Omidvar","Ran Cheng","Jurgen Branke"],"meta":["July 2020IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics PP(99)","DOI:10.1109/TCYB.2020.3011828"],"references":["331142747_A_Scalable_Test_Suite_for_Continuous_Dynamic_Multiobjective_Optimization","329768966_Bandit-based_cooperative_coevolution_for_tackling_contribution_imbalance_in_large-scale_optimization_problems","328579719_A_clonal_selection_algorithm_for_dynamic_multimodal_function_optimization","326906844_Changing_or_keeping_solutions_in_dynamic_optimization_problems_with_switching_costs","324878087_An_Open_Framework_for_Constructing_Continuous_Optimization_Problems","320376115_A_Hybrid_Particle_Swarm_Optimization_for_High-Dimensional_Dynamic_Optimization","319211416_Evolutionary_Multiobjective_Optimization_Based_Multimodal_Optimization_Fitness_Landscape_Approximation_and_Peak_Detection","334384066_A_generator_for_dynamically_constrained_optimization_problems","331107610_A_Framework_for_Inducing_Artificial_Changes_in_Optimization_Problems","316466354_DG2_A_Faster_and_More_Accurate_Differential_Grouping_for_Large-Scale_Black-Box_Optimization"]}
