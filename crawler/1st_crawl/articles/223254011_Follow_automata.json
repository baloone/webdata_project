{"id":"223254011_Follow_automata","abstract":"We give two new algorithms for constructing small nondeterministic finite automata (NFA) from regular expressions. The first constructs NFAs with ε-transitions (εNFA) which are smaller than all the other εNFAs obtained by similar constructions. Their size is at most , where α is the regular expression. This is very close to optimal since we prove also the lower bound . The second constructs NFAs. It uses ε-elimination in the εNFAs we just introduced and builds a quotient of the well-known position automaton w.r.t. the equivalence given by the follow relation; therefore giving the name of follow automaton. The new automaton uses optimally the information from the positions of a regular expression. We compare the follow automaton with the best constructions to date and show that it has important advantages over those.","authors":["Lucian Ilie","Sheng Yu"],"meta":["October 2003Information and Computation 186(1):140-162","DOI:10.1016/S0890-5401(03)00090-7","SourceDBLP"],"references":["318494277_Mastering_Regular_Expressions","270870742_Computing_e_-Free_NFA_from_Regular_Expressions_in_O_n_log_2_n_Time","262371638_Regular_Languages","253068166_The_Abstract_Theory_of_Automata","247112797_Parsing_Theory_Languages_and_Parsing","243784753_An_nlogn_algorithm_for_minimizing_the_states_of_a_nite_automaton","235208212_An_N_Log_N_Algorithm_for_Minimizing_States_in_a_Finite_Automaton","234784463_Programming_Techniques_Regular_expression_search_algorithm","228057764_Introduction_To_Automata_Theory_Languages_And_Computation","225816949_Computing_the_Equation_Automaton_of_a_Regular_Expression_in_Os2_Space_and_Time","224583682_Regular_Expressions_and_State_Graphs_for_Automata","222734141_Partial_derivatives_of_regular_expressions_and_finite_automaton_constructions","222146204_Translating_Regular_Expressions_into_Small_e-Free_Nondeterministic_Finite_Automata","221567968_New_Finite_Automaton_Constructions_Based_on_Canonical_Derivatives","221313897_From_regular_expressions_to_DFA's_using_compressed_NFA's","221313734_Constructing_NFAs_by_Optimal_Use_of_Positions_in_Regular_Expressions","220980282_Regular_Expressions_into_Finite_Automata","220975404_Algorithms_for_Computing_Small_NFAs","220574896_Translating_Regular_Expressions_into_Small_-Free_Nondeterministic_Finite_Automata","220430648_Derivatives_of_Regular_Expressions","220421762_Regular_Expression_Search_Algorithm","44127630_From_Regular_Expressions_to_Deterministic_Automata","24383964_Fuzzy_automata_and_pattern_matching"]}
