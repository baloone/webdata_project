{"id":"220808488_Analysis_of_computer_science_related_curriculum_on_LDA_and_Isomap","abstract":"A good curriculum is crucial for a successful university education. When developing a curriculum, topics, such as natural science, informatics, and so on are set first, course syllabi are written accordingly. However, the topics actually by the courses are not guaranteed to be identical to the initially set topics. To find out if the actual topics are covered by the developed course syllabi, we developed a method of systematically analyzing syllabi that uses latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and Isomap. We applied this method to the syllabi of MIT and those of the Open University, and verified that the method is effective.","authors":["Takayuki Sekiya","Yoshitatsu Matsuda","Kazunori Yamaguchi"],"meta":["January 2010","DOI:10.1145/1822090.1822106","SourceDBLP","Conference: Proceedings of the 15th Annual SIGCSE Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education, ITiCSE 2010, Bilkent, Ankara, Turkey, June 26-30, 2010"],"references":["221620547_Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation","220874292_MIMA_Search_A_Structuring_Knowledge_System_towards_Innovation_for_Engineering_Education","285599593_A_Global_Geometric_Framework_for_Nonlinear_Dimensionality_Reduction","224143900_Development_of_a_curriculum_analysis_tool","200033852_UCI_Machine_Learning_Repository_Irvine"]}
