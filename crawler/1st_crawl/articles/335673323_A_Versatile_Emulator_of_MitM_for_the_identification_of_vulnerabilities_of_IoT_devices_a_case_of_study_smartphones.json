{"id":"335673323_A_Versatile_Emulator_of_MitM_for_the_identification_of_vulnerabilities_of_IoT_devices_a_case_of_study_smartphones","abstract":"With the emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the proliferation of communicating objects, new security issues appear. These devices store a significant amount of personal and sensitive data that must be strongly protected. In most of the case, they are more protected against communication attacks than hardware attacks. Smartphones, as the most popular connected object, represent the perfect example of a study for a hardware attack on PCIe data bus. \nIn this paper, we present an emulator of the Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack for vulnerabilities identification in IoT devices. The proposed architecture performs real-time data analysis, extraction, and fault injection. The invisibility of the MitM attack represents the main challenge of the implementation, that could be done by respecting the highly constraining requirements of the PCIe protocol such as response time, frequency, and throughput.","authors":["Mohamed Amine Khelif","Jordane Lorandel","Olivier Romain","Matthieu Regnery"],"meta":["July 2019","DOI:10.1145/3341325.3342019","Conference: the 3rd International Conference"],"references":["331653292_BadBluetooth_Breaking_Android_Security_Mechanisms_via_Malicious_Bluetooth_Peripherals","302777045_Security_enclave_processor_for_a_system_on_a_chip","281784536_Mactans_Injecting_Malware_Into_iOS_Devices_via_Malicious_Chargers","279916676_High_Precision_Fault_Injections_on_the_Instruction_Cache_of_ARMv7-M_Architectures","333182355_Using_bluetooth_low_energy_spoofing_to_dispute_device_details_demo","326614226_Laser-Induced_Fault_Injection_on_Smartphone_Bypassing_the_Secure_Boot","321660182_Laser-Induced_Fault_Injection_on_Smartphone_Bypassing_the_Secure_Boot","310823654_ECDSA_Key_Extraction_from_Mobile_Devices_via_Nonintrusive_Physical_Side_Channels","265077538_iPhone_security_model_vulnerabilities"]}
