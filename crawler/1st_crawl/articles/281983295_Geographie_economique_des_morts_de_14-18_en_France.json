{"id":"281983295_Geographie_economique_des_morts_de_14-18_en_France","abstract":"Geography of the dead of WWI in France\nThis article uses the new database « Mémoire des Hommes » (MdH) and the 1911 survey. To analyze the geographic spread of dead of the Great War, we have assessed the potential of mobilizable by areas and tested an econometric model which includes demographic, economic and spatial variables to identify the factors influencing the number of dead. If demographic factors are the main determinants, economic variables combined with geographic and spatial variables correctly explain the spread of the number of dead by areas.\nCodes JEL : N 34, N 44.","authors":["Henri Gilles","Jean-Pascal Guironnet","Antoine Parent"],"meta":["January 2014Revue Économique 65(3)","DOI:10.3917/reco.653.0519"],"references":["277664929_Generalized_Linear_Models_Monographs_on_Statistics_and_Applied_Probability_No_37","261682218_Transformation_of_the_Independent_Variables","240747330_Compter_les_vivants_et_les_morts_l'evaluation_des_pertes_francaises_de_1914-1918","46522686_Chomage_et_salaires_en_France_sur_longue_periode"]}
