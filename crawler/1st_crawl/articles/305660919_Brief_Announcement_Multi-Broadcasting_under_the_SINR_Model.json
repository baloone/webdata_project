{"id":"305660919_Brief_Announcement_Multi-Broadcasting_under_the_SINR_Model","abstract":"We study the multi-broadcast problem in multi-hop ad-hoc wireless networks, under the SINR model, deployed in the 2D Euclidean plane. In multi-broadcast, there are $k$ initial messages, potentially belonging to different nodes, that must be forwarded to all $n$ nodes of the network. We present deterministic algorithms for multi-broadcast for the different settings reflecting the different types of knowledge, about the topology of the network, available to the nodes: (i) the whole network topology (ii) their own coordinates and coordinates of their neighbors (iii) only their own physical coordinates (iv) only their own ids and the ids of their neighbors, but not actual physical co-ordinates. The last result is specially interesting, as it is the first deterministic protocol, for the SINR model, that does not require nodes to know their coordinates in the plane (a very specialized type of knowledge), but intricately exploits the fact that they lie on a two dimensional plane.","authors":["Sai Praneeth Reddy","Shailesh Vaya"],"meta":["July 2016","DOI:10.1145/2933057.2933064","Conference: the 2016 ACM Symposium"],"references":["283279914_Distributed_Communication_in_Bare-Bones_Wireless_Networks","235638546_Distributed_Deterministic_Broadcasting_in_Wireless_Networks_of_WeakDevices_under_the_SINR_Model","221343992_Broadcasting_in_udg_radio_networks_with_unknown_topology","220897179_Efficient_Distributed_Communication_in_Ad-Hoc_Radio_Networks","220566838_Broadcasting_in_UDG_radio_networks_with_unknown_topology","311491109_Distributed_communication_in_bare-bones_wireless_networks","274730735_Multi-Broadcasting_under_the_SINR_Model","220780564_Selective_families_superimposed_codes_and_broadcasting_on_unknown_radio_networks","220657815_Broadcasting_in_Geometric_Radio_Networks"]}
