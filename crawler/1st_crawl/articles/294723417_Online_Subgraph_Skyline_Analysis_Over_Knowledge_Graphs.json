{"id":"294723417_Online_Subgraph_Skyline_Analysis_Over_Knowledge_Graphs","abstract":"Subgraph search is very useful in many real-world applications. However, users may be overwhelmed by the masses of matches. In this paper, we propose a subgraph skyline analysis problem, denoted as S2A, to support more complicated analysis over graph data. Specifically, given a large graph G and a query graph q, we want to find all the subgraphs g in G, such that g is graph isomorphic to q and not dominated by any other subgraphs. In order to improve the efficiency, we devise a hybrid feature encoding incorporating both structural and numeric features based on a partitioning strategy, and discuss how to optimize the space partitioning. We also present a skylayer index to facilitate the dynamic subgraph skyline computation. Moreover, an attribute cluster-based method is proposed to deal with the curse of dimensionality. Extensive experiments over real datasets confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm.","authors":["Weiguo Zheng","Xiang Lian","Lei Zou","Liang Hong"],"meta":["July 2016IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering 28(7):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TKDE.2016.2530063"],"references":["258373711_Querying_Knowledge_Graphs_by_Example_Entity_Tuples","254005703_Skyline-sensitive_joins_with_LR-pruning","249573134_RDF3X_a_RISC-style_engine_for_RDF","225475610_SkyGraph_An_algorithm_for_important_subgraph_discovery_in_relational_graphs","221613248_SaLSa_Computing_the_skyline_without_scanning_the_whole_sky","221215014_FG-Index_towards_verification-free_query_processing_on_graph_databases","221214278_Finding_k-dominant_skylines_in_high_dimensional_space","221213419_Skyline_query_processing_over_joins","220765456_Mining_Dominant_Patterns_in_the_Sky","220538885_gStore_Answering_SPARQL_queries_via_subgraph_matching","220473845_Understanding_the_meaning_of_a_shifted_sky_A_general_framework_on_extending_skyline_query","220343586_NP-hardness_of_Euclidean_sum-of-squares_clustering","220225024_Progressive_Skyline_Computation_in_Database_Systems","4330903_Skyline-join_in_distributed_databases","4330790_TALE_A_tool_for_approximate_large_graph_matching","4263229_On_Efficient_Processing_of_Subspace_Skyline_Queries_on_High_Dimensional_Data","4250975_The_Multi-Relational_Skyline_Operator","4234726_SUBSKY_Efficient_computation_of_skylines_in_subspaces","3193784_A_SubGraph_Isomorphism_Algorithm_for_Matching_Large_Graphs","304456688_Querying_knowledge_Graphs_By_Example_entity_tuples","285671997_Efficient_Subgraph_Skyline_Search_Over_Large_Graphs","281478909_Exploiting_Relevance_Feedback_in_Knowledge_Graph_Search","278664991_Shooting_Stars_in_the_Sky","276465217_Schemaless_and_structureless_graph_querying","276465135_Exemplar_queries","262405402_SCARAB_Scaling_reachability_computation_on_large_graphs","262397140_Worst-Case_IO-Efficient_Skyline_Algorithms","262170422_NeMa_Fast_graph_search_with_label_similarity","262163868_Confluence_Conformity_Influence_in_Large_Social_Networks","250614954_A_multiobjective_evolutionary_programming_framework_for_graph-based_data_mining","241770704_Query-driven_discovery_of_semantically_similar_substructures_in_heterogeneous_networks","234831436_An_Algorithm_for_Subgraph_Isomorphism","224237564_PrefJoin_An_efficient_preference-aware_join_operator","221310438_Shooting_Stars_in_the_Sky_An_Online_Algorithm_for_Skyline_Queries","221310364_Efficient_Computation_of_the_Skyline_Cube","221310241_Efficient_Progressive_Skyline_Computation","221310178_Catching_the_Best_Views_of_Skyline_A_Semantic_Approach_Based_on_Decisive_Subspaces","221103127_A_novel_spectral_coding_in_a_large_graph_database","220966946_Data_Cube_A_Relational_Aggregation_Operator_Generalizing_Group-By_Cross-Tab_and_Sub-Total","220965261_FlexPref_A_Framework_for_Extensible_Preference_Evaluation_in_Database_Systems","220788061_NOVA_A_Novel_and_Efficient_Framework_for_Finding_Subgraph_Isomorphism_Mappings_in_Large_Graphs","220618371_Maximizing_Non-Monotone_Submodular_Functions","220538341_On_Graph_Query_Optimization_in_Large_Networks","220504257_Skyline_and_mapping_aware_join_query_evaluation","220473758_Optimization_and_evaluation_of_shortest_path_queries","4250921_TreePi_A_Novel_Graph_Indexing_Method","3892911_The_Skyline_Operator","2374777_The_Skyline_Operator"]}
