{"id":"334379444_Cyber_Weapons_Storage_Mechanisms","abstract":"In this paper, the current status of the art of cyber weapon storage methods and related processes are reviewed with particular reference to the safe guards present in storage of cyber weapons and contingency planning in case of losing controls of such weapons. Existing methods are summarized and new techniques which are currently under development are described. Some of the current limitations and challenges are also identified. To tackle these challenges, we propose a socio-technical framework, in which Cyber Ranges can play a major role.","authors":["Muhammd Mudassar Yamin","Basel Katt","Mazaher Kianpour"],"meta":["July 2019","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-24907-6_27","In book: Security, Privacy, and Anonymity in Computation, Communication, and Storage (pp.354-367)"],"references":["326856144_Review_2017_Strategic_Trends_in_the_Global_Cyber_Conflict","265122961_Understanding_Insider_Threat_A_Framework_for_Characterising_Attacks","309003504_The_looming_shadow_of_illicit_trade_on_the_internet","272995056_Configurational_Comparative_Methods_Qualitative_Comparative_Analysis_QCA_and_Related_Techniques_Benoit_Rihoux_and_Charles_Ragin_eds_Thousand_Oaks_CA_Sage_Publications_2009_pp_xxv_209","263261465_Offensive_Cyber_Weapons_Construction_Development_and_Employment","261962226_Configurational_Comparative_Methods_Qualitative_Comparative_Analysis_QCA_and_Related_Techniques_by_Benoit_Rihoux_Charles_Ragin","261389218_Taxonomic_analysis_of_classification_schemes_in_vulnerability_databases"]}
