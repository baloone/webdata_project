{"id":"328162174_Radical_Voronoi_tessellation_from_random_pack_of_polydisperse_spheres_Prediction_of_the_cells'_size_distribution","abstract":"This paper investigates the relevance of the representation of polycrystalline aggregates using Radical Voronoï Voronoï (RV) tessellation, computed from Random Close Packs (RCP) of spheres with radius distribution following a lognormal distribution. A continuous relationship between the distribution of sphere radii with that of RV cell volumes is proposed. The stereology problem (deriving the 3D grain size distributions from 2D sections) is also investigated: two statistical methods are proposed, giving analytical continuous relationships between the apparent grain size distribution and the sphere radius distribution. In order to assess the proposed methods, a 3D aggregate has been generated based on a EBSD map of a real polycrystalline microstructure.","authors":["Dorian Depriester","Regis Kubler"],"meta":["February 2019Computer-Aided Design 107:37-49","DOI:10.1016/j.cad.2018.09.001","Project: Mechanical behaviour of structure and microstructures"],"references":["274363600_DREAM3D_A_Digital_Representation_Environment_for_the_Analysis_of_Microstructure_in_3D","256975530_Measurement_of_Crystal_Size_Distributions","256832177_Effect_of_rectangular_container's_sides_on_porosity_for_equal-sized_sphere_packing","321470806_Integrated_approach_for_geometric_modeling_and_interactive_visual_analysis_of_grain_structures","316578932_Generation_of_3D_polycrystalline_microstructures_with_a_conditioned_Laguerre-Voronoi_tessellation_technique","309464386_An_extension_of_the_Saltykov_method_to_quantify_3D_grain_size_distributions_in_mylonites","277024823_New_3D_geometrical_deposition_methods_for_efficient_packing_of_spheres_based_on_tangency","272487930_Fast_Parallel_Algorithms_for_Short-Range_Molecular_Dynamics","266501300_Measuring_Skewness_A_Forgotten_Statistic","252552338_Anisotropy_in_Simulated_Random_Packing_of_Equal_Spheres"]}
