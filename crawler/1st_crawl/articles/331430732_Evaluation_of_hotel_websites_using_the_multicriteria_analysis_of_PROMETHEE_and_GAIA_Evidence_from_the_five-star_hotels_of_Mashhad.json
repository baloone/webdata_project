{"id":"331430732_Evaluation_of_hotel_websites_using_the_multicriteria_analysis_of_PROMETHEE_and_GAIA_Evidence_from_the_five-star_hotels_of_Mashhad","abstract":"E-commerce has grown considerably with increasing access to the Internet. As a means of e-commerce, websites play a vital role in the hotel industry. The most important task of any website is the provision of tailored information and services to satisfy client needs. This research aimed to evaluate the status of websites and e-services provided by five-star hotels. For this purpose, initial criteria and subcriteria for evaluation were determined using the fuzzy Delphi method. The weight of the criteria was calculated using the Shannon entropy method. Finally, PROMETHEE and GAIA methods were utilised to rank and develop the visual aid of websites. Once these perceptions were captured, amongst the four criteria determined for the evaluation of websites of hotels, customer orientation was the most important criterion, followed by marketing, security and technology. Moreover, the websites of the five-star hotels of Mashhad were evaluated and ranked to validate the proposed model.","authors":["Maryam Ostovare","Mohammad Reza Shahraki"],"meta":["February 2019Tourism Management Perspectives 30:107-116","DOI:10.1016/j.tmp.2019.02.013"],"references":["328096130_Evaluating_innovation_capabilities_of_real_estate_firms_a_combined_fuzzy_Delphi_and_DEMATEL_approach","327818794_The_dimensions_of_hotel_customer_ratings_that_boost_RevPAR","326425570_Selection_of_the_technologically_most_appropriate_variant_of_the_solar_photovoltaic_PV_water_supply_system_by_using_multi-criteria_methods_PROMETHEE_and_GAIA","323099266_Urban_Renewal_Mega_Projects_and_Residents'_Quality_of_Life_Evidence_from_Historical_Religious_Center_of_Mashhad_Metropolis","320436589_The_platform_shapes_the_message_How_website_design_affects_abstraction_and_valence_of_online_consumer_reviews","315872442_E-service_Quality_Management_of_a_Hotel_Website_A_Scale_and_Implications_for_Management","312668118_Motivators_and_inhibitors_in_booking_a_hotel_via_smartphones","264817921_Internet_marketing_for_sustainable_development_and_rural_tourism","263161234_Adapting_to_the_Internet_Trends_in_Travelers'_Use_of_the_Web_for_Trip_Planning","259123901_A_hybrid_multi-criteria_decision_making_model_to_evaluate_hotel_websites","256606708_A_Multi-Criteria_Group_Decision_Framework_for_Partner_Grouping_When_Sharing_Facilities","251715955_The_establishment_and_application_of_fuzzy_comprehensive_model_with_weight_based_on_entropy_technology_for_air_quality_assessment","222868816_Progress_in_tourism_management_A_review_of_website_evaluation_in_tourism_research","329170903_On_the_elicitation_of_criteria_weights_in_PROMETHEE-based_ranking_methods_for_a_mobile_application","328137799_The_presence_of_tourists_and_residents_in_shared_travel_photos","327427686_Regional_tourism_competitiveness_using_the_PROMETHEE_approach","326004130_Urban_flooding_risk_assessment_based_on_an_integrated_k-means_cluster_algorithm_and_improved_entropy_weight_method_in_the_region_of_Haikou_China","325704303_Evaluation_of_hotel_websites_Progress_and_future_developments","325211938_The_Use_of_Fuzzy_Linguistic_Information_and_Fuzzy_Delphi_Method_to_Validate_by_Consensus_a_Questionnaire_in_a_Blended-Learning_Environment","324484051_Evaluation_of_ecotourism_sites_a_GIS-based_multi-criteria_decision_analysis","323299479_Impacts_of_temporal_and_gender_difference_on_hotel_selection_process","316146049_A_Meta-analysis_of_Online_Trust_Relationships_in_E-commerce","314764005_Restaurant_Marketing_on_the_Worldwide_Web","314238342_How_locus_of_control_shapes_intention_to_reuse_mobile_apps_for_making_hotel_reservations_Evidence_from_chinese_consumers","312668061_An_updated_comprehensive_review_of_website_evaluation_studies_in_hospitality_and_tourism","308296649_Evaluating_regional_low-carbon_tourism_strategies_using_the_fuzzy_Delphi-_analytic_network_process_approach","307935513_Decision_aids_for_selection_problems","291953061_A_study_of_e-commerce_adoption_by_tourism_websites_in_China","290471591_A_Modified_Model_for_Hotel_Website_Functionality_Evaluation","289625508_A_Fuzzy-Algorithmic_Approach_to_the_Definition_of_Complex_or_Imprecise_Concepts","284263122_Multiple_Criteria_Decision_Analysis_State_of_the_Art_Surveys_chapter_Promethee_methods","275413400_Present_and_future_hotel_website_marketing_activities_Change_propensity_analysis","274196942_Official_tourist_destination_websites_Hierarchical_analysis_and_assessment_with_ELECTRE-III-H","271732309_Tool_steel_material_selection_using_PROMETHEE_II_method","267236512_Power_substation_location_selection_using_fuzzy_analytic_hierarchy_process_and_PROMETHEE_A_case_study_from_Bangladesh","264811959_Website_adoption_and_performance_by_Iranian_hotels","257403865_A_probabilistic_decision-making_approach_for_the_sustainable_assessment_of_infrastructures","251547777_How_green_are_North_American_hotels_An_exploration_of_low-cost_adoption_practices","247624090_The_role_of_electronic_commerce_in_creating_virtual_tourism_destination_marketing_organisations","247273568_Hotel_Management_and_Marketing_on_the_InternetAn_Analysis_of_Sites_and_Features","235696911_The_SMAA-PROMETHEE_methods","227445629_Note---A_Preference_Ranking_Organisation_Method","227350023_Value_Maximization_Stakeholder_Theory_and_the_Corporate_Objective_Function","223996181_Decision_making_in_stock_trading_an_application_of_PROMETHEE","223556701_Adaptation_of_an_information_quality_framework_to_measure_customers'_behavioral_intentions_to_use_lodging_Web_sites","222225118_Using_expert_technology_to_select_unstable_slicing_machine_to_control_wafer_slicing_quality_via_fuzzy_AHP","220690424_Fuzzy_Mathematical_Models_in_Engineering_and_Management_Science","46491847_PROMETHEE_A_comprehensive_literature_review_on_methodologies_and_applications"]}
