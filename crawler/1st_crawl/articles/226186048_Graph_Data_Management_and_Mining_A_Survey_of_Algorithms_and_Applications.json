{"id":"226186048_Graph_Data_Management_and_Mining_A_Survey_of_Algorithms_and_Applications","abstract":"Graph mining and management has become a popular area of research in recent years because of its numerous applications in\na wide variety of practical fields, including computational biology, software bug localization and computer networking. Different\napplications result in graphs of different sizes and com- plexities. Correspondingly, the applications have different requirements\nfor the underlying mining algorithms. In this chapter, we will provide a survey of dif- ferent kinds of graph mining and management\nalgorithms. We will also discuss a number of applications, which are dependent upon graph representations. We will discuss\nhow the different graph mining algorithms can be adapted for different applications. Finally, we will discuss important avenues\nof future research in the area.","authors":["Charu C.
