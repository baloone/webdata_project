{"id":"260928097_A_Proposal_of_Operational_Risk_Management_Method_Using_FMEA_for_Drug_Manufacturing_Computerized_System","abstract":"This paper proposes operational Risk Management (RM) method using\nFailure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) for drug manufacturing\ncomputerlized system (DMCS). The quality of drug must not be influenced\nby failures and operational mistakes of DMCS. To avoid such situation,\nDMCS has to be conducted enough risk assessment and taken precautions.\nWe propose operational RM method using FMEA for DMCS. To propose the\nmethod, we gathered and compared the FMEA results of DMCS, and develop a\nlist that contains failure modes, failures and countermeasures. To apply\nthis list, we can conduct RM in design phase, find failures, and conduct\ncountermeasures efficiently. Additionally, we can find some failures\nthat have not been found yet.","authors":["Masakazu Takahashi","Reiji Nanba","Yoshinori Fukue"],"meta":["June 2012Transactions of the Society of Instrument and Control Engineers 48(5):285-294","DOI:10.9746/sicetr.48.285"],"references":[]}
