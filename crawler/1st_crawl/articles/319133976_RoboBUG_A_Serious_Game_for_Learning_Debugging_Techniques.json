{"id":"319133976_RoboBUG_A_Serious_Game_for_Learning_Debugging_Techniques","abstract":"Debugging is an essential but challenging task that can present a great deal of confusion and frustration to novice programmers. It can be argued that Computer Science education does not sufficiently address the challenges that students face when identifying bugs in their programs. To help students learn effective debugging techniques and to provide students a more enjoyable and motivating experience, we have designed the RoboBUG game. RoboBUG is a serious game that can be customized with respect to different programming languages and game levels.","authors":["Michael Alexander Miljanovic","Jeremy Bradbury"],"meta":["August 2017","DOI:10.1145/3105726.3106173","Conference: the 2017 ACM Conference"],"references":["274378317_A_Serious_Game_for_Developing_Computational_Thinking_and_Learning_Introductory_Computer_Programming","268185826_SteAlth_ASSeSSment_in_computer-BASed_GAmeS_to_Support_leArninG","266657514_Code_hunt_Searching_for_secret_code_for_fun","237267086_Chapter_I_A_Qualitative_Meta-Analysis_of_Computer_Games_as_Learning_Tools","344151950_CHAPTER_6_Scientific_Debugging","303362871_Robot_ON_a_serious_game_for_improving_programming_comprehension","271496988_Novices'_Debugging_Behaviors_in_VB_Programming","271466292_A_demonstration_of_gidget_a_debugging_game_for_computing_education","269032027_Debugging_assistance_for_novices","261960648_Debugging_tutor_preliminary_evaluation"]}
