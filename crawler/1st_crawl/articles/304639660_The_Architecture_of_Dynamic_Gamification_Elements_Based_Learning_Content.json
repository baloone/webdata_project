{"id":"304639660_The_Architecture_of_Dynamic_Gamification_Elements_Based_Learning_Content","abstract":"We are becoming increasingly aware of the effectiveness of electronics application when it comes to teaching. One example of modern electronic application is Electronic Learning (E-Learning). The development of IT has led to the advent of a new approach or a new study called Gamification. Gamification is defined as the use of game elements (game thinking) in a non-game context to increase engagement between humans and computers as well as to increase problem-solving. This study obtained a positive analysis after conducting a survey with students and from interviewing experts. This study also found an issue in regard to learning content development and presentation. Moreover, we found that the representation of knowledge in a learning application would positively influence students. The current study aims to build an architecture of dynamic gamification elements and to evaluate this architecture using the Architecture-Level Modifiability Analysis method. Finally, the results of the expert interview taking into account the criteria of architecture are also discussed.","authors":["Firas Layth Khaleel","Noraidah Sahari Ashaari","Tengku Siti Meriam Tengku Wook Tengku Wook","Amirah Ismail"],"meta":["June 2016Journal of Convergence Information Technology 11(3):164-177","Project: Right now I'm going to finalise the effectiveness of gamification on student learning..."],"references":["304627725_The_study_of_gamification_application_architecture_for_programming_language_course","304627718_User-enjoyable_learning_environment_based_on_Gamification_elements","262166227_GradeCraft_What_can_we_learn_from_a_game-inspired_learning_management_system","261084333_Behavior_response_among_secondary_school_students_development_towards_mobile_learning_application","259394024_Effectiveness_of_a_Multimodal_Online_Well-Being_Intervention_A_Randomized_Controlled_Trial","266653292_A_gamified_mobile_application_for_engaging_new_students_at_university_orientation","261498579_An_Exploratory_Study_on_the_Use_of_Collaborative_Riding_Based_on_Gamification_as_a_Support_to_Public_Transportation","261342641_CodeSmellExplorer_Tangible_exploration_of_code_smells_and_refactorings","261301650_genegamesorg_High-Throughput_Access_to_Biological_Knowledge_and_Reasoning_through_Online_Games","260720766_A_Fine-Grained_Outcome-Based_Learning_Path_Model"]}
