{"id":"228462673_On_the_Dominating_Set_Polytope_of_a_Cycle","abstract":"A subset of vertices of a graph is called a dominating set if every vertex of the graph which is not present in the set has at least one neighbour in it. Dominating set polytope of a graph is defined as the convex hull of 0/1-incidence vectors of all the dominating sets of the graph. This paper presents complete characterization of the dominating set polytope of a cycle.","authors":["Anureet Saxena"],"meta":["May 2004"],"references":["227201937_On_the_Set_Covering_Polytope_I_All_the_facets_with_coefficients_in_0_1_2","226771590_On_the_Set_Covering_Polytope_II_Lifting_the_Facets_with_Coefficients_in_0_1_2","268635310_Polytope_Des_Absorbants_Dans_Une_Classe_De_Graphe_a_Seuil","266272946_On_the_Set-Covering_Polytope_III_Complete_characterization_of_3-critical_matrices","242619830_Fundamentals_of_Domination_in_Graphs","242087725_Polyhedral_studies_in_Domination_Graph_Theory_I","226553387_On_The_Facial_Structure_of_the_Set_Covering_Polytope","225259874_Facets_and_Lifting_Procedures_for_the_Set_Covering_Polytope","223671266_One-node_cutsets_and_the_dominating_set_polytope","222628100_Domination_independent_domination_and_duality_in_strongly_chordal_graphs","221933085_Introduction_To_Graph_Theory","216877623_On_the_01_Facets_of_the_Set_Covering_Polytope"]}
