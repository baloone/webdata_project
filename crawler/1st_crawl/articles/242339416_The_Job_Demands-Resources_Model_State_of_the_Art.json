{"id":"242339416_The_Job_Demands-Resources_Model_State_of_the_Art","abstract":"Purpose\n– The purpose of this paper is to give a state‐of‐the art overview of the Job Demands‐Resources (JD‐R) model\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\n– The strengths and weaknesses of the demand‐control model and the effort‐reward imbalance model regarding their predictive value for employee well being are discussed. The paper then introduces the more flexible JD‐R model and discusses its basic premises.\n\nFindings\n– The paper provides an overview of the studies that have been conducted with the JD‐R model. It discusses evidence for each of the model's main propositions. The JD‐R model can be used as a tool for human resource management. A two‐stage approach can highlight the strengths and weaknesses of individuals, work groups, departments, and organizations at large.\n\nOriginality/value\n– This paper challenges existing stress models, and focuses on both negative and positive indicators of employee well being. In addition, it outlines how the JD‐R model can be applied to a wide range of occupations, and be used to improve employee well being and performance.","authors":["Arnold B.
