Each step of the single-hop network is emulated by O((D+logn/ɛ)logΔ) rounds of the multi-hop network and succeeds with probability≥1−ɛ. (n is the number of processors, D the diameter and Δ the maximum degree). It is shown how to emulate any polynomial algorithm such the probability of failure remains ≤ɛ.\nA consequence of the emulation is an efficient randomized algorithm for choosing a leader in a multi-hop network.","authors":["Reuven Bar-Yehuda","Oded Goldreich","Alon Itai"],"meta":["September 1989Distributed Computing 5(2):24-32","DOI:10.1007/BF02259748","SourceDBLP","Conference: Distributed Algorithms, 3rd International Workshop, Nice, France, September 26-28, 1989, Proceedings"],"references":["234821185_On_the_complexity_of_radio_communication","234812166_Multiple_communication_in_multi-hop_radio_networks","234802142_ALOHA_Packet_System_With_and_Without_Slots_and_Capture","221343624_On_the_Time-Complexity_of_Broadcast_in_Radio_Networks_An_Exponential_Gap_Between_Determinism_and_Randomization","224733582_On_Broadcasting_in_Radio_Networks--Problem_Analysis_and_Protocol_Design","220616975_Log-Logarithmic_Selection_Resolution_Protocols_in_a_Multiple_Access_Channel","3157744_The_wave_expansion_approach_to_broadcasting_in_multihop_radio_networks","3084146_A_perspective_on_multiaccess_channels","3048842_Tree-Based_Broadcasting_in_Multihop_Radio_Networks"]}
