{"id":"312430857_Modeling_of_Cyber_Target_Selection_for_Effective_Acquisition_of_Cyber_Weapon_Systems","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a model that can effectively select cyber targets when acquiring cyber weapons systems. Cyber target selection is the process of deriving the most vulnerable part of the target system. Cyber target selection is carried out with 3 components such as 'center of gravity', 'target attribute and control characteristics', and 'type and characteristics of information communication system'. Gravity refers to the weakest part of the enemy (security holes), and the security holes that cause the most decisive effects when cyber-attacks are happening. The target attributes are classified into the geographical attributes where the target is, the functional attributes which tasks are performed, and the human attributes who uses and who owns them. Control characteristics are the factors that determine how an attack effect on a potential target system occurs by cyber weapons systems or operations. When a cyber-attack target is selected, the final attack target is selected by the form, characteristic, and function by distinguishing the target of the center, the target of the layer, and the list of the information communication system. And then, the main attack points that are targets of actual cyber operations are selected based on the selected cyber targets.","authors":["Ki Hoon Kim","Jung ho Eom"],"meta":["November 2016International Journal of Security and its Applications 10(11):293-302","DOI:10.14257/ijsia.2016.10.11.24"],"references":[]}
