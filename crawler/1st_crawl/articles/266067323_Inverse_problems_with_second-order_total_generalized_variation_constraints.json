{"id":"266067323_Inverse_problems_with_second-order_total_generalized_variation_constraints","abstract":"Total Generalized Variation (TGV) has recently been intro-duced as penalty functional for modelling images with edges as well as smooth variations [2]. It can be interpreted as a \"sparse\" penalization of optimal balancing from the first up to the k-th distributional derivative and leads to desirable results when applied to image denoising, i.e., L 2 -fitting with TGV penalty. The present paper studies TGV of second order in the context of solving ill-posed linear inverse problems. Existence and sta-bility for solutions of Tikhonov-functional minimization with respect to the data is shown and applied to the problem of re-covering an image from blurred and noisy data.","authors":["Kristian Bredies","Tuomo Valkonen"],"meta":["January 2011"],"references":["231140889_A_convergence_rates_result_for_Tikhonov_regularization_in_Banach_spaces_with_non-smooth_operators","222469583_Nonlinear_total_variation_based_noise_removal_algorithms","27290213_Nikolova_M_Local_strong_homogeneity_of_a_regularized_estimator_SIAM_J_Appl_Math_612_633-658","264908946_Duality_for_the_Sum_of_Convex_Functions_in_General_Banach_Spaces","246778021_Mathematical_Problems_in_Plasticity","226456870_Image_recovery_via_total_variation_minimization_and_related_problems","224201153_A_fourth_order_dual_method_for_staircase_reduction_in_texture_extraction_and_image_restoration_problems","220124409_Total_Generalized_Variation","44241018_A_First-Order_Primal-Dual_Algorithm_for_Convex_Problems_with_Applications_to_Imaging","41700512_Structural_Properties_of_Solutions_to_Total_Variation_Regularization_Problems"]}
