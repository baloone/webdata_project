{"id":"315100333_TURET20_Thesis_Writing_Tutor_Aimed_on_Lexical_Richness_in_Students'_Texts","abstract":"Writing thesis is a process of constant interaction between the student and academic advisor, but writing correctly is a complex task for students even if they have the support of a teacher. The elaboration of the thesis document requires the implementation of a methodology and procedures, which constitute the elements of the format and structure in the thesis. This work shows an intelligent tutoring system (TURET2.0) designed in a web platform and which provides a customized tutoring for students in drafting their writings, specifically to evaluate the lexical richness of seven sections of the thesis. Moreover, as a way to motivate students to achieve their goals, some gamification techniques were implemented. The measures used to assess the lexical richness are lexical variety, lexical density and sophistication.","authors":["Samuel González-López","Aurelio Lopez-Lopez","Jesús Miguel Garcia Gorrostieta","Indelfonso Rodríguez Espinoza"],"meta":["September 2016Research in Computing Science 129(1):9-17","DOI:10.13053/rcs-129-1-1","Project: Linguistic Analysis of Research Drafts of Undergraduate Students"],"references":["268577301_Gamification_of_Joint_StudentSystem_Control_Over_Problem_Selection_in_a_Linear_Equation_Tutor","234102081_Guru_A_Computer_Tutor_That_Models_Expert_Human_Tutors","285665872_The_Writing-Pal_Natural_Language_Algorithms_to_Support_Intelligent_Tutoring_on_Writing_Strategies","285500517_Syntactic_maturity_mechanics_and_vocabulary_as_predictors_of_quality_ratings","273793162_Lexical_analysis_of_student_research_drafts_in_computing","268336791_Virtual_Agent_Oriented_to_e-Learning_Processes"]}
