{"id":"258509303_An_Efficient_Authentication_and_Access_Control_Scheme_for_Perception_Layer_of_Internet_of_Things","abstract":"In this paper, we proposed an efficient authentication and access control method based on general view of the security issues\nfor perception layer of Internet of Things (IoT). The advantage of the proposed method is establishing session key based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC). This enhances mutual authentication between the user and sensor nodes, and intermediate processes. On the other hand, this method solves the resource-constrained problem in perception layer of the Internet of Things.","authors":["Ning YE","Yan Zhu","Ru-chuan WANG","Reza Malekian"],"meta":["July 2014Applied Mathematics & Information Sciences 8(4)","DOI:10.12785/amis/080416"],"references":["261479017_Authentication_and_Access_Control_in_the_Internet_of_Things","261354791_A_novel_mutual_authentication_scheme_for_Internet_of_Things","254023990_An_ID-based_user_authentication_scheme_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_using_ECC","289144050_An_authorization_management_approach_in_the_internet_of_things","261430873_A_new_access_control_scheme_based_on_protection_of_sensitive_attributes","261084915_Identity_establishment_and_capability_based_access_control_IECAC_scheme_for_Internet_of_Things","241636715_The_privacy-aware_access_control_system_using_attribute-and_role-based_access_control_in_private_cloud","241175767_An_extended_role_based_access_control_model_for_the_Internet_of_Things","234811555_BABAC_An_Access_Control_Framework_for_Network_Virtualization_Using_User_Behaviors_and_Attributes","224262165_A_Novel_Secure_Architecture_for_the_Internet_of_Things","222571757_The_Internet_of_Things_A_Survey","224154270_On_the_Security_of_an_Enhanced_Novel_Access_Control_Protocol_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","224151414_An_attribute_and_role_based_access_control_model_for_service-oriented_environment","222708179_Internet_of_Things_-_New_security_and_privacy_challenges","222627946_A_novel_access_control_protocol_for_secure_sensor_networks"]}
