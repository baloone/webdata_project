{"id":"313252842_An_assessment_of_the_effectiveness_of_moodle_e-learning_system_for_undergraduate_Public_Administration_education","abstract":"The use of information and communication technologies (ICT) and therefore e-learning is becoming an ever more frequently used teaching and learning technique at all levels of education. The purpose of the paper is to analyse how introduction of Moodle e-learning platform as part of the teaching process is related with students' performance i.e., the average grade and the average number of admissions to the exams. We also examined the same relationship among different groups of students (based on selected individual socio-demographic factors). The study included a member of the University of Ljubljana (Faculty of Public Administration) in the period from 2008 till 2014. The results of the analysis (using a t-test) show a significant improvement in performance at the different (faculty-, student- and course-) levels after introducing the Moodle. The data show that the greatest improvement is seen among students with lower high school grades.","authors":["Lan Umek","Damijana Ker탑i훾","Aleksander Aristovnik","Nina Toma탑evi훾"],"meta":["January 2017International Journal of Innovation and Learning 21(2):165","DOI:10.1504/IJIL.2017.081939"],"references":["277950691_E-learning_Challenges_and_ambitions_at_Hashemite_University","275109678_Identification_of_factors_affecting_university_instructors'_adoption_of_hybrid_e-learning","254445732_The_Impact_of_ICT_on_Educational_Performance_and_its_Efficiency_In_Selected_EU_and_OECD_Countries_A_Non-Parametric_Analysis","252667526_Adaptivity_in_e-learning","238501431_Evaluation_of_Adaptive_Course_Construction_Toolkit_ACCT","237429805_A_Model_for_Sustainable_Student_Retention_A_Holistic_Perspective_on_the_Student_Dropout_Problem_with_Special_Attention_to_e-Learning","228690587_Factors_that_influence_students'_decision_to_dropout_of_online_courses","220374458_Factors_Influencing_Adult_Learners'_Decision_to_Drop_Out_or_Persist_in_Online_Learning","26397393_Online_Information_Technologies_Certificate_Program","313016337_E-Learning_as_a_Socio-Technical_System_An_Insight_into_Factors_Influencing_its_Effectiveness","298953753_E-learning_and_study_effectiveness","287097640_Why_online_learners_drop_out","284396345_Meta-Analysis_on_Relations_between_E-Learning_Research_Trends_and_Effectiveness_of_Learning","276014492_Perspectives_of_University_Students_on_Cooperative_Learning_by_Moodle","263417643_Computer_self-efficacy_and_factors_influencing_e-learning_effectiveness","242610157_Early_Attrition_among_First_Time_eLearners_A_Review_of_Factors_that_Contribute_to_Drop-out_Withdrawal_and_Non-completion_Rates_of_Adult_Learners_undertaking_eLearning_Programmes","242529420_Foundations_of_educational_theory_for_online_learning","235921511_E-learning_and_face_to_face_mixed_methodology_Evaluating_effectiveness_of_e-learning_and_perceived_satisfaction_for_a_microeconomic_course_using_the_Moodle_platform","235250232_E-learning_markets_and_providers_Some_issues_and_prospects","220374842_Predictors_for_Student_Success_in_an_Online_Course","44829906_Issues_in_Web-based_pedagogy_A_critical_primer","26339481_Read_all_about_it_Online_learning_facing_80_attrition_rates"]}
