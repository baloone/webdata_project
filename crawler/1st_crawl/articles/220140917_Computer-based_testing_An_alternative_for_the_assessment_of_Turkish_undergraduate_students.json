{"id":"220140917_Computer-based_testing_An_alternative_for_the_assessment_of_Turkish_undergraduate_students","abstract":"Virtually errorless high speed data processing feature has made computers popular assessment tools in education. An important concern in developing countries considering integrating computers as an educational assessment tool before making substantial investment is the effects of computer-based testing on studentsâ€™ test scores as compared to paper-and-pencil tests. This study investigated whether test scores of Turkish students were different in the computer-based test and in the paper-and-pencil test, with forty-seven undergraduate students studying at a public university located in the Blacksea region of Turkey. Findings of this study showed that test scores of undergraduate students were not different in the computer-based test and in the paper-and-pencil test which led us to reach the conclusion that computer-based testing can be considered as a promising alternative technique for the undergraduate students in Turkey.","authors":["Omur Akdemir","Ayse Oguz Unver"],"meta":["November 2008Computers & Education 51(3):1198-1204","DOI:10.1016/j.compedu.2007.11.007","SourceDBLP"],"references":["274713232_Evaluating_comparability_of_paper-and-pencil_and_computer-based_assessment_in_a_K-12_setting_1","232485286_Equivalence_of_Computerized_and_Paper-and-Pencil_Cognitive_Ability_Tests_A_Meta-Analysis","229783881_Is_there_a_method_to_our_madness_The_impact_of_data_collection_methodology_on_organizational_survey_results","222052980_Computer_anxiety_and_its_correlates_A_meta-analysis","12444122_Tell_me_what_did_you_see_The_stimulus_on_computers","313188873_The_four_generations_of_computerized_educational_measurement","291870919_Computer-based_assessment","284079670_The_Equivalence_of_Paper-and-Pencil_and_Computer-Based_Testing","277689849_The_Equivalence_of_Scores_from_Automated_and_Conventional_Educational_and_Psychological_Tests_A_Review_of_the_Literature","274347183_The_development_of_the_Attitude_Towards_Computerized_Assessment_Scale","262258801_Computer-based_testing_Building_the_foundation_for_future_assessments","250144827_The_Score_Comparability_of_Computerized_and_Paper-and-Pencil_Formats_for_K-3_Reading_Tests","249233927_An_Investigation_into_the_Effects_and_Factors_Influencing_Computer-Based_Online_Math_Problem-Solving_in_Primary_Schools","248941297_Inexperienced_and_Anxious_Computer_Users_Coping_With_a_Computer-Administered_Test_of_Academic_Skills","247727503_The_Effects_of_Past_Computer_Experience_on_Computerized_Aptitude_Test_Performance","240919304_Guidelines_for_Computer-Based_Tests_and_Interpretations","232460467_The_four_generations_of_computerized_educational_measurement","232431643_Computer-based_testing_in_higher_education","230323595_Development_Implementation_and_Validation_of_a_Computerized_Test_for_Statewide_Assessment","227935629_Research_on_the_Effects_of_Administering_Tests_via_Computers","223523964_The_effects_of_computer_anxiety_state_anxiety_and_computer_experience_on_users'_performance_of_computer_based_tasks","223118716_Principles_for_creating_a_computerized_test_battery","220496201_Computer-based_tests_the_impact_of_test_design_and_problem_of_equivalency","14109412_Computer_versus_paper-and-Pencil_administration_mode_and_response_distortion_in_noncognitive_selection_tests"]}
