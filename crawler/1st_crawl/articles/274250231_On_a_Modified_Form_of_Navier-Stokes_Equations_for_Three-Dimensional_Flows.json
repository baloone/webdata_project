{"id":"274250231_On_a_Modified_Form_of_Navier-Stokes_Equations_for_Three-Dimensional_Flows","abstract":"A rephrased form of Navier-Stokes equations is performed for incompressible, three-dimensional, unsteady flows according to Eulerian formalism for the fluid motion. In particular, we propose a geometrical method for the elimination of the nonlinear terms of these fundamental equations, which are expressed in true vector form, and finally arrive at an equivalent system of three semilinear first order PDEs, which hold for a three-dimensional rectangular Cartesian coordinate system. Next, we present the related variational formulation of these modified equations as well as a general type of weak solutions which mainly concern Sobolev spaces.","authors":["John C Venetis"],"meta":["March 2015The Scientific World Journal Volume 2015 (2015)(Article ID 692494):9 pages","DOI:10.1155/2015/692494"],"references":["265460207_Counter-examples_in_differential_equations_and_related_topics","295736587_Navier-Stokes_Equations_Theory_and_Numerical_Analysis","273212768_Vector_Analysis_with_an_Introduction_to_Tensor_Analysis","270310626_Introduction_to_Partial_Differential_Equations_With_Applications","267072909_Mesh_Free_Methods_Moving_Beyond_Finite_Element_Method","266981561_The_Eulerian_limit_and_the_slip_boundary_conditions_-_admissible_irregularity_of_the_boundary","266175996_Lectures_on_Fluid_Mechanics","265442637_The_Mathematical_Theory_Of_Viscous_Incompressible_Fluid","265435857_Mathematical_topics_in_fluid_mechanics_Vol_1_Incompressible_models","265423170_The_Initial_Value_Problem_for_the_Navier-Stokes_Equations"]}
