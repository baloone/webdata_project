{"id":"327100288_An_exploratory_study_of_cyber_hygiene_behaviors_and_knowledge","abstract":"End users' cyber hygiene often plays a large role in cybersecurity breaches. Therefore, we need a deeper understanding of the user differences that are associated with either good or bad hygiene and an updated perspective on what users do to promote good hygiene (e.g., employ firewall and anti-virus applications). Those individuals with good cyber hygiene follow best practices for security and protect their personal information. This exploratory study of cyber hygiene knowledge and behavior offers information that designers and researchers can employ to improve users' hygiene practices. We surveyed 268 participants about their knowledge of concepts, their knowledge of threats, and their behaviors related to cyber hygiene. Further, we asked participants about their previous training and experiences. Notably, the participants represent a large cross section from age 18 to 55 +. We addressed inconsistencies in the literature, we provide up-to-date information on behaviors and on users' knowledge about password usage and phishing, and we explored the impact of age, gender, victim history, perceived expertise, and training on cyber hygiene.","authors":["Ashley A.
