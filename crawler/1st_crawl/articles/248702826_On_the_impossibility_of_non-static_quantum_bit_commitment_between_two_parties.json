{"id":"248702826_On_the_impossibility_of_non-static_quantum_bit_commitment_between_two_parties","abstract":"Recently, Choi et al. proposed an assumption on Mayers–Lo–Chau (MLC) no-go theorem that the state of the entire quantum system is invariable to both participants before the unveiling phase. This makes us suspect that the theorem is only applicable to static quantum bit commitment (QBC). This paper clarifies that the MLC no-go theorem can be applied to not only static QBC, but also non-static one. A non-static QBC protocol proposed by Choi et al. is briefly reviewed and analyzed to work as a supporting example. In addition, a novel way to prove the impossibility of the two kinds of QBC is given.","authors":["Qin Li","Chengqing Li","Dongyang Long","Wai-Hong Chan"],"meta":["March 2012Quantum Information Processing 11(2):519-527","DOI:10.1007/s11128-011-0259-5","SourcearXiv"],"references":["238961339_Quantum_Oblivious_Transfer","228935639_Quantum_bit_commitment_revisited_the_possible_and_the_impossible","228109483_WITHDRAWN_Quantum_cryptography_Public_key_distribution_and_coin_tossing","225128191_Perfect_Zero-Knowledge_Arguments_for_NPUsing_Any_One-Way_Permutation","221355357_Committed_Oblivious_Transfer_and_Private_Multi-Party_Computation","312685110_Quantum_cryptography_based_on_Bell's_theorem","294494904_Perfect_zero-knowledge_arguments_for_NP_using_any_one-way_permutation","258590815_Study_on_Quantum_Oblivious_Transfer","222469205_Minimum_disclosure_proofs_of_knowledge","222457508_A_complete_classification_of_quantum_ensembles_having_a_given_density_matrix"]}
