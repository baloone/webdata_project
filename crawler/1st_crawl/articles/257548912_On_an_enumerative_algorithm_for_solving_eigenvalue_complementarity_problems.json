{"id":"257548912_On_an_enumerative_algorithm_for_solving_eigenvalue_complementarity_problems","abstract":"In this paper, we discuss the solution of linear and quadratic eigenvalue complementarity problems (EiCPs) using an enumerative algorithm of the type introduced by Júdice et al. (Optim. Methods Softw. 24:549–586, 2009). Procedures for computing the interval that contains all the eigenvalues of the linear EiCP are first presented. A nonlinear programming (NLP) model for the quadratic EiCP is formulated next, and a necessary and sufficient condition for a stationary point of the NLP to be a solution of the quadratic EiCP is established. An extension of the enumerative algorithm for the quadratic EiCP is also developed, which solves this problem by computing a global minimum for the NLP formulation. Some computational experience is presented to highlight the efficiency and efficacy of the proposed enumerative algorithm for solving linear and quadratic EiCPs.","authors":["Luís M.
