{"id":"335198988_Research_on_the_Construction_and_Application_of_A_Cloud_Computing_Experiment_Platform_for_Computer_Science_General_Education_Courses","abstract":"Cloud computing is a new type of service computing model that has developed rapidly in recent years. This paper analyzes the common problems in the experimental teaching of computer science general courses in colleges and universities and combines the significant advantages of cloud computing in dynamic allocation and flexible sharing to build a cloud computing experiment platform for computer science general education course. The platform of general education curriculum, design platform structure and experimental system model are designed, and then the practical effects and advantages of the platform are analyzed. Practice shows that the platform has certain application values, and it can effectively stimulate studentsâ€™ interest in learning and enhance teaching effect.","authors":["Nian Xiong","Xiaoli Liu","Shan Zhou","Zhenyu He"],"meta":["August 2019Journal of Physics Conference Series 1288(1):012014","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/1288/1/012014"],"references":["330587827_Quantitative_Analysis_of_Opacity_in_Cloud_Computing_Systems","323384444_Cloud_Computing_Management_Platform_of_Human_Resource_Based_on_Mobile_Communication_Technology","331879564_Online_Multi-Workflow_Scheduling_under_Uncertain_Task_Execution_Time_in_IaaS_Clouds","330586859_A_Streaming_Cloud_Platform_for_Real-Time_Video_Processing_on_Embedded_Devices","328457792_Research_on_University_Online_Education_Resource_Management_Platform_Based_on_Cloud_Computing","327784680_Teaching_Resources_Construction_of_Fundamentals_of_Computers_in_the_Cloud_Platform","324080682_Architectural_Design_of_Trusted_Platform_for_IaaS_Cloud_Computing","323831885_Architectural_Design_of_Trusted_Platform_for_IaaS_Cloud_Computing","323063557_Cloud_computing_platforms_for_delivering_computer_science_and_mathematics_instructional_course_content_to_learners","283028019_A_Cloud-Based_Experiment_Platform_for_Computer-Based_Education"]}
