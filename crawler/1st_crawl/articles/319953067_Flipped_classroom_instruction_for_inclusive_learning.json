{"id":"319953067_Flipped_classroom_instruction_for_inclusive_learning","abstract":"The flipped classroom is a teaching methodology that has gained recognition in primary, secondary and higher education settings. The flipped classroom inverts traditional teaching methods, delivering lecture instruction outside class, and devoting class time to problem solving, with the teacher's role becoming that of a learning coach and facilitator. This methodology provides an avenue for more hands-on and student-driven learning during class time. The benefits of a flipped classroom include increased student motivation, differentiating instruction, self-pacing lessons and mastery learning, increased collaboration and instant feedback for formative assessment. Although limited research has been conducted regarding students with learning difficulties in inclusive settings using a flipped learning model, initial research indicates flipping a classroom can be beneficial. Information is provided on inclusive practices from numerous countries that are beneficial to students with learning difficulties, as well as strategies and resources for individuals who may want to implement a flipped classroom.","authors":["Lisa Altemueller","Cynthia Lindquist"],"meta":["September 2017British Journal of Special Education 44(4)","DOI:10.1111/1467-8578.12177"],"references":["305494885_The_flipped_classroom_for_active_effective_and_increased_learning_-_especially_for_low_achievers","298801093_The_flipped_classroom_and_cooperative_learning_Evidence_from_a_randomised_experiment","286077056_Using_the_flipped_classroom_to_improve_student_engagement_and_to_prepare_graduates_to_meet_maritime_industry_requirements_a_focus_on_maritime_education","286047548_The_Impact_of_the_Flipped_Classroom_on_Mathematics_Concept_Learning_in_High_school","266647588_Implementing_the_Flipped_Classroom_in_Elementary_and_Secondary_Schools_in_China","326026403_I_Flipped_My_Classroom_One_Teacher's_Quest_to_Remain_Relevant","297363866_Preparing_to_Teach_with_Flipped_Classroom_in_Teacher_Preparation_Programs","296969899_Flipping_for_mastery","287104845_The_Flipped_Classroom_Online_instruction_at_home_frees_class_time_for_learning","262091819_10_Reasons_to_Flip","238338584_The_Differentiated_Classroom_Responding_the_Needs_of_All_Learners"]}
