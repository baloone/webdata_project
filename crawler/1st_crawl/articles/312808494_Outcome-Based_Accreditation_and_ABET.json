{"id":"312808494_Outcome-Based_Accreditation_and_ABET","abstract":"ABET is a not-for-profit, nongovernmental accreditor of degree granting programs in applied science, computing, engineering, and engineering technology. ABET uses a peer review process to evaluate academic programs at the associate, bachelor, and masterâ€™s levels. This paper discusses the evolution of the ABET accreditation system from an input-based system which focused on what was being taught, to an outcomes-based system which focuses on what is being learned.","authors":["P.E Michael K.
