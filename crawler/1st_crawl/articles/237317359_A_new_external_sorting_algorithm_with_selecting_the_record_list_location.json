{"id":"237317359_A_new_external_sorting_algorithm_with_selecting_the_record_list_location","abstract":"Like other external sorting algorithms, the presented algorithm is a two step algorithm including internal and external steps. The first part of the algorithm is like the other similar algorithms but second part of that is including a new easy implementing method which has reduced the vast number of input-output operations saliently. As decreasing processor operating time does not have any effect on main algorithm speed, any improvement in it should be done through decreasing the number of input-output operations. This paper propose an easy algorithm for choose the correct record location of the final list. This decrease the time complexity and makes the algorithm faster.","authors":["Iraj Hassanzadeh","M. H.
