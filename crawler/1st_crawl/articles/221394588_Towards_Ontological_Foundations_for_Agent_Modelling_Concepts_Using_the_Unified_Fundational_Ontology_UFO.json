{"id":"221394588_Towards_Ontological_Foundations_for_Agent_Modelling_Concepts_Using_the_Unified_Fundational_Ontology_UFO","abstract":"Foundational ontologies provide the basic concepts upon which any domain-specific ontology is built. This paper presents a new foundational ontology, UFO, and shows how it can be used as a foundation of agent concepts and for evaluating agent-oriented modelling methods. UFO is derived from a synthesis of two other foundational ontologies, GFO/GOL and OntoClean/DOLCE. While their main areas of application are the natural sciences and linguistics/cognitive engineering, respectively, the main purpose of UFO is to provide a foundation for conceptual modelling, including agent- oriented modelling.","authors":["Giancarlo Guizzardi","Gerd Wagner"],"meta":["January 2004","DOI:10.1007/11426714_8","SourceDBLP","Conference: Agent-Oriented Information Systems II, 6th International Bi-Conference Workshop, AOIS 2004, Riga, Latvia, June 8, 2004 and New York, NY, USA, July 20, 2004,Revised Selected Papers"],"references":["256109186_Framework_for_formal_ontology","324374357_The_Concept_of_Identity","320181808_The_Construction_of_Social_Reality","316324519_Treatise_on_Basic_Philosophy","313752523_A_radical_revision_of_UML's_role_concept","274907838_The_Concept_of_Identity","270300115_The_Logic_of_Common_Nouns_An_Investigation_in_Quantified_Modal_Logic","270183932_Treatise_on_Basic_Philosophy","269447912_The_Concept_of_Identity","264922547_Meta-Object_Facility_Specification"]}
