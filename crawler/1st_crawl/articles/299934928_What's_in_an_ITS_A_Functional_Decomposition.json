{"id":"299934928_What's_in_an_ITS_A_Functional_Decomposition","abstract":"The status of the research in the area of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) has become ambiguous. The history of ITS research is rich, and especially in the 70s it was fundamental AI research, but now it is more and more applied AI. This means that many of the modern AI techniques are lacking. From [34] it is difficult to distil a unifying conception of ITS research. Literature of the 80s is descriptive rather than technical or theoretical. There are almost no attempts towards unification or formalization; on the contrary, there seems to be more confusion about what an ITS is about and what it is made of. In this paper we try to answer this last question by presenting, what we think the functional decomposition of ITS should look like, and we contrast it with the traditional “3-expert” framework that emerges from literature.","authors":["Radboud Winkels","Joost Breuker"],"meta":["January 1992","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-77681-6_5","In book: New Directions for Intelligent Tutoring Systems (pp.57-68)"],"references":["301559448_Methodology_and_Modularity_in_ITS_design","226635397_Some_principles_of_intelligent_tutoring","222454028_The_Epistemology_of_a_Rule-Based_Expert_System_-_A_Framework_for_Explanation","313572819_Some_Principles_of_Intelligent_Tutoring","313145134_An_investigation_of_computer_coaching_for_informal_learning_activities","313077661_Qualitative_physics_A_personal_view","301633957_ITS'88_The_International_Conference_on_Intelligent_Tutoring_Systems_Montreal_Canada_June_1-3_1988","284534358_A_cognitive_theory_of_inquiry_teaching","283399204_Use_of_Models_in_the_Interpretation_of_Verbal_Data","281885327_Artificial_Intellig_ence_and_Tutoring_Systems_Computational_and_Cognitive_Approaches_to_the_Communication_of_Knowledge","267689843_Tutoring_That_Responds_to_User_Questions_and_Provides_Enrichment","247341198_Readings_in_Distributed_Artificial_Intelligence_San_Mateo","244444686_The_Engineering_of_Qualitative_Models","243778945_Discourse_Planning_in_Intelligent_Help_Systems","243764954_Model-driven_Knowledge_Acquisition","243745715_EUROHELP_Developing_Intelligent_Help_Systems","243465578_Pedagogical_natural_language_and_knowledge_engineering_techniques_in_SOPHIE_I_II_and_III","243448106_Meta-Level_Architectures_and_Reflection","242802979_Intelligent_Tutoring_Systems","242358178_The_genetic_graph_A_representation_for_the_evolution_of_procedural_knowledge","240447902_Natural_Language_Understanding_Benjamin_-_Cummings_Publishing_Company","238674865_An_investigation_of_computer_coaching_for_informal_learning_activities","235127328_The_Knowledge_Engineer_as_Student_Metacognitive_Bases_for_Asking_Good_Questions","234831549_Distributed_artificial_intelligence_vol_2","234824790_Learning_Issues_for_Intelligent_Tutoring_Systems","234792407_A_critiquing_approach_to_expert_computer_advice_Attending","234705751_Aspects_of_a_Theory_of_Simplification_Debugging_and_Coaching","228328574_Artificial_Intelligence_and_Tutoring_Systems","223665340_The_design_and_evaluation_of_an_adaptive_teaching_system","222455586_Planning_English_referring_expressions","221451059_A_New_Framework_for_Describing_and_Designing_Intelligent_Tutoring_Systems","220837396_Interpretation_of_Verbal_Data_for_Knowledge_Acquisition","220693159_Natural_Language_Understanding","220690972_Foundations_of_Intelligent_Tutoring_Systems","220308815_Control_for_Intelligent_Tutoring_Systems_A_Blackboard-based_Dynamic_Instructional_Planer","19646990_Critiquing_A_Different_Approach_to_Expert_Computer_Advice_in_Medicine"]}
