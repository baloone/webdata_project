{"id":"234484493_Eclipse_Cycles_and_Eclipses_at_Stonehenge","abstract":"Was Stonehenge used to predict eclipses? Previous claims have assumed a\nhigh degree of sophistication on the part of the builders of Stonehenge,\nand that the number of Aubrey holes (56) is particularly significant. It\nmay be that neither assumption is justified or necessary, and that if\nthe builders of Stonehenge did predict eclipses, they did it in much\nsimpler ways.","authors":["R. Colton","R. L.
