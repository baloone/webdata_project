{"id":"264965602_On_the_number_of_zeros_of_Abelian_integrals_A_constructive_solution_of_the_infinitesimal_Hilbert_sixteenth_problem","abstract":"We prove that the number of limit cycles generated from nonsingular energy level ovals (periodic trajectories) in a small non-conservative perturbation of a Hamiltonian polynomial vector field on the plane, is bounded by a double exponential of the degree of the fields. This solves the long-standing infinitesimal Hilbert 16th problem.\nThe proof uses only the fact that Abelian integrals of a given degree are horizontal sections of a regular flat meromorphic connection defined over â„š (the Gauss-Manin connection) with a quasiunipotent monodromy group.","authors":["Gal Binyamini","D.
