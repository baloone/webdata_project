{"id":"327325058_A_new_dual_network_generating_algorithm_for_epidemic","abstract":"Dual networks have been used to describe the interplay between different diffusion processes. In order to study the interaction between the propagation processes, research efforts have been paid on the study of its topological and dynamical properties. However, the generating algorithm based on different dynamic processes are mostly simple and specific. To systemically study the dynamical processes on the multiplex networks, a general multiplex network generating algorithm is necessary. In this paper, we study the interaction between the epidemic spreading and the awareness diffusion, and carry out a general dual network generating algorithm considering the special infectious disease by abstracting the properties about the two dynamic processes. Moreover, we regarded the HFMD as an example to study the dynamic processes on the dual network which established by the proposed algorithm. The simulation results show that, compared with the previous model which randomly adds links to the contagion network, the epidemic threshold of the model on the dual network generated by our algorithm is small.","authors":["Changlun Zhang","Xiuxiu Sun","Nan Ning"],"meta":["July 2018","DOI:10.1145/3239283.3239312","Conference: the 2018 International Conference"],"references":["322251862_Twitter_Mining_for_Ontology-based_Domain_Discovery_Incorporating_Machine_Learning","299395950_Community_Size_Effects_on_Epidemic_Spreading_in_Multiplex_Social_Networks","281929772_A_Preliminary_Approach_to_Domain-Based_Evaluation_of_Users'_Trustworthiness_in_Online_Social_Networks","272184496_Two-stage_effects_of_awareness_cascade_on_epidemic_spreading_in_multiplex_networks","257460322_Dynamical_Interplay_between_Awareness_and_Epidemic_Spreading_in_Multiplex_Networks","255972432_Growing_Multiplex_Networks","249995417_Mathematical_Formulation_of_Multi-Layer_Networks","249317333_Statistical_mechanics_of_multiplex_networks_Entropy_and_overlap","236627402_Statistical_Mechanics_of_Multiplex_Ensembles_Entropy_and_Overlap","308500017_An_algorithm_for_multiplex_network_generation","308499472_A_general_approach_of_generating_multiplex_networks_with_overlapped_links","266014505_On_a_problem_in_the_theory_of_graphs_Hungarian","255244736_Network_Science_From_the_Web_to_Human_Diseases","13660517_Collective_Dynamics_of_Small_World_Networks"]}
