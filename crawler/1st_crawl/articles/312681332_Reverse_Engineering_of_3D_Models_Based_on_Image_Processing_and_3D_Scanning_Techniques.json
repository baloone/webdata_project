Laser-based sensors are non-contact fast sensors and therefore are commonly used to digitize the object. However, 3D boundary detection of the 3D digitized points produced by laser-based scanners is problematic due to the fact that the sensor data is often unreliable near sharp edges.\nA new method based on fusion of 3D scanned data and an intensity image is proposed to overcome the above problems and improve the accuracy of the reconstructed surface. The 3D scanned data provides 3D data explicitly, whereas an intensity image offers other 2D characteristic information such as texture and boundary. For smooth freeform surfaces that generate smooth 2D silhouettes, characteristic curves of the object such as boundaries can be derived from its image using edge-detection algorithms. The feasibility of the method is demonstrated by several examples.","authors":["A. Manor","A.
