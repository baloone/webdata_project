{"id":"267216485_Droppin'_Science_and_Dropping_Science_African_American_Males_and_Urban_Science_Education","abstract":"This paper explores components of urban science education that are underemphasized in contemporary research in the field of study and widely considered necessary for improving the experiences of African-American males in science. It explores the current state of urban science education through critical reflection from the standpoint of an African-American male student and teacher and calls for the use of appropriate theoretical frameworks for constructing meaning of the African American male experience in urban schools. Finally, through a broad description of a research study in urban science classrooms, the paper provides insight into future research that considers the frameworks prescribed and described in the paper.","authors":["Christopher Emdin"],"meta":[],"references":["279673793_Autoethnography_and_Narratives_of_Self_Reflections_on_Criteria_in_Action","275847991_The_Field_of_Cultural_Production_Essays_on_Art_and_Literature","249835058_The_Influence_of_Sociodemographics_and_Gender_on_the_Disproportionate_Identification_of_Minority_Students_as_Having_Learning_Disabilities","249714199_Analyzing_Analytic_AutoethnographyAn_Autopsy","234731262_Teachers'_Perceptions_and_Expectations_and_the_Black-White_Test_Score_Gap","228173844_Sociological_Theories_of_Human_Emotions","227643843_Technology-rich_inquiry_science_in_urban_classrooms_What_are_the_barriers_to_inquiry_pedagogy","344702330_Urban_Science_Education_for_the_Hip-Hop_Generation","312918756_Social_Capital_in_the_Creation_of_Human_Capital","297415342_Attracting_the_best_and_the_brightest","275838934_The_Ethnographic_Self_Fieldwork_and_the_Representation_of_Identity","275714562_How_critical_reflection_triggers_transformative_learning","275687613_Outsiders_Studies_in_the_Sociology_of_Deviance","275636379_Developing_Critical_Thinkers","274492016_Face_to_Face_Toward_a_Sociological_Theory_of_Interpersonal_Behavior","268505137_Racial_Inequity_in_Special_Education","252964548_Articulating_Communities_Sociocultural_Perspectives_on_Science_Education","249693462_Sound-Image_Data_Records_for_Research_on_Social_Interaction","246524194_Introduction_Entering_the_field_of_qualitative_research","246480411_Insights_of_Genius_Imagery_and_Creativity_in_Science_and_Art","232920313_Affiliation_and_alienation_Hip-hop_rap_and_urban_science_education","232581259_Designing_Funded_Qualitative_Research","229911198_The_Black-White_Achievement_Gap_as_a_Perennial_Challenge_of_Urban_Science_Education_A_Sociocultural_and_Historical_Overview_with_Implications_for_Research_and_Practice","229817342_Gender_Race_Ethnicity_and_Science_Education_in_the_Middle_Grades","229728578_Urban_African-American_middle_school_science_students_Does_standards-based_teaching_make_a_difference","229640706_Analysis_of_nine_high_school_biology_laboratory_manuals_Promoting_scientific_inquiry","227940869_Creating_a_culture_of_academic_success_in_an_urban_science_and_math_magnet_high_school","227926553_Tracing_the_Historical_Origins_of_Youth_Delinquency_Violence_Myths_Realities_About_Black_Culture","227879875_Multiculturalism_Universalism_and_Science_Education","227805143_Globalization_and_science_education_The_implications_of_science_in_the_new_economy","227496569_Reversing_the_standard_direction_Science_emerging_from_the_lives_of_African_American_students","227273419_Sense_of_Community_and_Positive_Adult_Beliefs_Toward_Adolescents_and_Youth_Policy_in_Urban_Neighborhoods_and_Small_Cities","226912943_Scientific_culture_multiculturalism_and_the_science_classroom","225889772_Exploring_the_contexts_of_urban_science_classrooms_Part_1_Investigating_corporate_and_communal_practices","200031235_Social_Capital_Its_Origins_and_Applications_in_Modern_Sociology","200031144_Structural_Holes_versus_Network_Closure_as_Social_Capital","41447723_Discursive_Identity_Assimilation_into_the_Culture_of_Science_and_its_Implications_for_Minority_Students"]}
