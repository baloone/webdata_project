{"id":"259273067_Evaluation_of_a_tactile_training_for_handwriting_acquisition_in_French_kindergarten_children_A_pilot_study","abstract":"Handwriting is a complex activity involving perceptivo-motor, cognitive and linguistic skills. Handwriting acquisition is a slow and difficult process which requires several years of formal training for a correct mastering. In this context, we argued that there is a crucial interest in proposing new assessment methods to improve handwriting acquisition. Most of the scholar trainings for handwriting only utilize sensory visual and auditory abilities of young children (5-6 years old). Recently, we have shown that manual tactile exploration efficiently improves classical trainings in reading, handwriting, and geometry. The present work is a continuation of these studies, and aims at elaborating new trainings for handwriting acquisition. Importantly, we hypothesized that proposing exercises which aim at developing proactive motor strategies improve handwriting acquisition. Particularly we designed new handwriting exercises based on the use of a tactile tablet. This training included videos in which the writing production of each cursive letter is presented to the child. We found that this tactile training significantly improves the writing fluency in French preschoolers. Thus, in the line of our earlier studies, this pilot study tends to show that training exercises using tactile devices can be helpful for the acquisition of handwriting in kindergarten children.","authors":["Caroline Jolly","Richard Palluel-Germain","Edouard Gentaz"],"meta":["January 2013","In book: Kindergartens: Teaching methods, expectations and current challenges (pp.161-176)Publisher: Nova Science Publishers: Hauppauge (USA)Editors: Henry Switzer, Dwayne Foulke"],"references":["259042185_La_memoire_de_travail_une_place_centrale_dans_les_apprentissages_scolaires_fondamentaux","313349482_l'ecriture_chez_l'enfant_Apprentissage_troubles_et_evaluation","291826545_L'empan_de_copie_comme_un_des_indicateurs_de_l'acquisition_de_la_langue_ecrite_chez_des_enfants_de_5-8_ans","286142503_Apprendre_a_ecrire","283437090_Les_habiletes_motrices","282315733_A_longitudinal_study_on_the_structure_of_handwriting","247723152_Direction_and_Sequence_in_CopyingThe_Effect_of_Learning_to_Write_in_English_and_Hebrew","247639360_The_Development_and_Use_of_Rules_in_the_Acquisition_of_Perceptual_Motor_Skill","247280016_Apprendre_a_tracer_les_lettres_Une_revue_critique","247280012_Ecrire_orthographier_et_rediger_des_textes"]}
