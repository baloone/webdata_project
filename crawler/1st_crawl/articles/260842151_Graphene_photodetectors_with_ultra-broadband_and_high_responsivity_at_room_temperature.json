{"id":"260842151_Graphene_photodetectors_with_ultra-broadband_and_high_responsivity_at_room_temperature","abstract":"The ability to detect light over a broad spectral range is central to several technological applications in imaging, sensing, spectroscopy and communication. Graphene is a promising candidate material for ultra-broadband photodetectors, as its absorption spectrum covers the entire ultraviolet to far-infrared range. However, the responsivity of graphene-based photodetectors has so far been limited to tens of mA W(-1) (refs 5, , , , , 10) due to the small optical absorption of a monolayer of carbon atoms. Integration of colloidal quantum dots in the light absorption layer can improve the responsivity of graphene photodetectors to ∼1 × 10(7) A W(-1) (ref. 11), but the spectral range of photodetection is reduced because light absorption occurs in the quantum dots. Here, we report an ultra-broadband photodetector design based on a graphene double-layer heterostructure. The detector is a phototransistor consisting of a pair of stacked graphene monolayers (top layer, gate; bottom layer, channel) separated by a thin tunnel barrier. Under optical illumination, photoexcited hot carriers generated in the top layer tunnel into the bottom layer, leading to a charge build-up on the gate and a strong photogating effect on the channel conductance. The devices demonstrated room-temperature photodetection from the visible to the mid-infrared range, with mid-infrared responsivity higher than 1 A W(-1), as required by most applications. These results address key challenges for broadband infrared detectors, and are promising for the development of graphene-based hot-carrier optoelectronic applications.","authors":["Chang-Hua Liu","You-Chia Chang","Theodore B Norris","Zhaohui Zhong"],"meta":["March 2014Nature Nanotechnology 9(4)","DOI:10.1038/nnano.2014.31","SourcePubMed"],"references":["260205902_Chip-integrated_ultrafast_graphene_photodetector_with_high_responsivity","258341641_High_Responsivity_GrapheneSilicon_Heterostructure_Waveguide_Photodetectors","239074147_Ultrafast_collinear_scattering_and_carrier_multiplication_in_graphene","236653320_Broadband_High_Photoresponse_from_Pure_Monolayer_Graphene_Photodetector","236615077_Strong_Light-Matter_Interactions_in_Heterostructures_of_Atomically_Thin_Films","235634030_CMOS-compatible_graphene_photodetector_covering_all_optical_communication_bands","233976798_Vertical_field-effect_transistor_based_on_graphene-WS_2_heterostructures_for_flexible_and_transparent_electronics","230925131_Optical_response_of_metal-insulator-metal_heterostructures_and_their_application_for_the_detection_of_chemicurrents","228325409_Photocurrent_measurements_of_supercollision_cooling_in_graphene","227396950_Light-matter_interaction_in_a_microcavity-controlled_graphene_transistor","224914566_Hybrid_graphene-quantum_dot_phototransistors_with_ultrahigh_gain","221666514_Photoconductivity_of_biased_graphene","51857559_Homogeneous_bilayer_graphene_film_based_flexible_transparent_conductor","51699611_Hot_Carrier-Assisted_Intrinsic_Photoresponse_in_Graphene","51606699_Strong_Plasmonic_Enhancement_of_Photovoltage_in_Graphene","46586774_Graphene_photodetectors_for_high-speed_optical_communications","44884421_Organic_photonics_for_communications","44602481_Nanostructured_materials_for_photon_detection","38070964_Ultrafast_Graphene_Photodetector","24174111_Ultrafast_Carrier_Dynamics_in_Graphite","23993643_Photocurrent_Imaging_and_Efficient_Photon_Detection_in_a_Graphene_Transistor","5464808_Fine_Structure_Constant_Defines_Visual_Transparency_of_Graphene","256855680_Optical_spectroscopy_of_graphene_From_the_far_infrared_to_the_ultraviolet","242012034_Infrared_detectors_Status_and_trends","234168703_Graphene_plasmonics","232236379_A_Roadmap_for_graphene","230769312_Infrared_Photodetectors_Based_on_CVD-Grown_Graphene_and_PbS_Quantum_Dots_with_Ultrahigh_Responsivity","228099151_Evidence_for_Extraction_of_Photoexcited_Hot_Carriers_from_Graphene","227163078_Graphene-Antenna_Sandwich_Photodetector","224916261_Microcavity-Integrated_Graphene_Photodetector","51660346_Hot_Carrier_Transport_and_Photocurrent_Response_in_Graphene","43081248_Graphene-On-Silicon_Schottky_Junction_Solar_Cells","40805058_Photo-Thermoelectric_Effect_at_a_Graphene_Interface_Junction","24239474_Imaging_of_Photocurrent_Generation_and_Collection_in_Single-Layer_Graphene"]}
