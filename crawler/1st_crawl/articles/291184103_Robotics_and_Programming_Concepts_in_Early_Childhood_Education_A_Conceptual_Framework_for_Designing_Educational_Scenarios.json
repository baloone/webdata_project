{"id":"291184103_Robotics_and_Programming_Concepts_in_Early_Childhood_Education_A_Conceptual_Framework_for_Designing_Educational_Scenarios","abstract":"This chapter addresses the teaching of programming through robotics in early childhood education. It discusses the integration of education robotics principles and algorithmic and programming concepts in order to conceive, design and evaluate educational scenarios (didactic sequences). It then proposes a conceptual framework for designing educational scenarios that integrate programmable toys as a guide to teaching programming concepts. A descriptive analysis of the implementation of educational scenarios by in-service early childhood teachers in typical classrooms covers methodological issues emerging from this framework. Furthermore, it provides research results to encompass the conception and designing of educational scenarios in early childhood educational contexts concerning robotics.","authors":["Anastasia Misirli","Vassilis Komis"],"meta":["June 2014","DOI:10.1007/978-1-4614-6501-0_8","In book: Research on e-Learning and ICT in Education (pp.99-118)"],"references":["289988466_Educational_scenarios_with_ICT_an_operational_design_and_implementation_framework","337075591_Le_jeu_de_l'enfant-robot_une_demarche_et_une_reflexion_en_vue_du_developpement_de_la_pensee_algorithmique_chez_les_tres_jeunes_enfants","321275099_Research_design_qualitative_quantitative_and_mixed_methods_approaches","317953561_Mind_in_society_The_development_of_higher_psychological_processes","313634175_Computer_as_paintbrush_Technology_play_and_the_creative_society","312376122_Actes_du_8eme_colloque_francophone_de_Robotique_Pedagogique","291036271_Bringing_engineering_to_elementary_school","288926656_Life-long_playing_instead_of_life-long_learning_Teaching_robotics_without_robots_and_computers","288525740_Research_design_Qualitative_quantitative_and_mixed_methods_approaches","288248785_Shift_to_the_future_Rethinking_learning_with_new_technologies_in_education"]}
