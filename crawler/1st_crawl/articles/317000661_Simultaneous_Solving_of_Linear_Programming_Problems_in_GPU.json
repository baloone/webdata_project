{"id":"317000661_Simultaneous_Solving_of_Linear_Programming_Problems_in_GPU","abstract":"Linear Programs (LPs) appear in a large number of applications. In this paper, we propose a CUDA implementation for solving a large number of LPs simultaneously in GPU. We show that our implementation has a maximum speed-up of 34.5Ã— for a LP of dimension(200 variables, 200 constraints), running 5000 LPs simultaneously in parallel, when compared to sequential solving using the open source GLPK (GNU Linear Programming Kit) library.","authors":["Amit Gurung","Binayak Das","Rajarshi Ray"],"meta":["December 2015","Conference: HiPC 2015","Projects: XSpeed: Accelerating Reachability Analysis on Multi-core ProcessorsParallel Model Checking of Hybrid Systems"],"references":["281584116_Parallel_state_space_exploration_of_linear_systems_with_inputs_using_XSpeed","228624487_Fast_cone-beam_CT_image_reconstruction_using_GPU_hardware","285089171_Optimizing_parallel_reduction_in_CUDA","261425224_A_GPU_Implementation_of_Generalized_Graph_Processing_Algorithm_GIM-V","260546673_Numerical_Weather_Prediction","251988816_Speed_improvements_of_peptide-spectrum_matching_using_SIMD_instructions","246697576_Linear_Programming_1_Introduction","224140961_An_efficient_GPU_implementation_of_the_revised_simplex_method","221149010_Multi_GPU_Implementation_of_the_Simplex_Algorithm"]}
