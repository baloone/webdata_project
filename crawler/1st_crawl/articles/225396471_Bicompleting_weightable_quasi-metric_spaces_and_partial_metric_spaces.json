{"id":"225396471_Bicompleting_weightable_quasi-metric_spaces_and_partial_metric_spaces","abstract":"We show that the bicompletion of a weightable quasi-metric space is a weightable quasi-metric space. From this result we deduce\nthat any partial metric space has an (up to isometry) unique partial metric bicompletion. Some other consequences are derived.\nIn particular, applications to two interesting examples of partial metric spaces which appear in Computer Science, as the\ndomain of words and the complexity space, are given.","authors":["Sandra Oltra Crespo","S.
