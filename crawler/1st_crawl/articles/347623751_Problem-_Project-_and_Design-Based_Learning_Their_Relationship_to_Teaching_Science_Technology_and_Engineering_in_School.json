{"id":"347623751_Problem-_Project-_and_Design-Based_Learning_Their_Relationship_to_Teaching_Science_Technology_and_Engineering_in_School","abstract":"Purpose The present study aims at shedding light on the meaning of three teaching and learning methods - problem-based learning, project-based learning and design-based learning, aimed at fostering studentsâ€™ lifelong learning skills such as problem solving, collaborative learning and self-direct learning. Methods This work is derived from the literature of constructivist pedagogy, and student-centered teaching and learning methods with focus on science, technology and engineering. Results Problem-based learning has to do mainly with creating theoretical knowledge, for example in science or mathematics. In project-based learning, there is a longstanding tradition in schools for \"doing projects,\" incorporating \"hands-on\" activities, developing interdisciplinary themes, implementing laboratory investigations and the creation of a useful artifact or system. Design-based learning corresponds to project-based learning, except that DBL requires learners to work according to acceptable engineering design processes. In the hearth of engineering design is generating alternative solutions and choosing systematically the optimal one, because engineering is merely a process of optimization and tradeoff. Conclusions In the present article, we have highlighted the differences between three problem-based learning, project-based learning and design-based learning, with hope that becoming familiar with these teaching methods will encourage educators and engineers to integrate them into teaching science, technology and engineering in schools.","authors":["Moshe Barak"],"meta":["October 2020Journal of Problem-Based Learning 7(2):94-97","DOI:10.24313/jpbl.2020.00227"],"references":["345383957_A_Learning_Model_for_Software_Coding_Education","338407076_Project_Based_Learning_to_Enhance_Environmental_Education_through_Automobile_Mechanics","277452339_Scaffolding_and_Achievement_in_Problem-Based_and_Inquiry_Learning_A_Response_to_Kirschner_Sweller_and_Clark_2006","243768523_The_project_method_Its_vocational_education_origin_and_international_development","317953561_Mind_in_society_The_development_of_higher_psychological_processes","285816998_Informed_design_A_contemporary_approach_to_design_pedagogy_as_the_core_process_in_technology","257926463_Knowing_Learning_and_Instruction_Essays_in_Honor_of_Robert_Glaser","243787557_Project-based_learning_A_handbook_for_middle_and_high_school_teachers","238162544_A_Review_of_Research_on_Project-Based_Learning","232543390_Motivating_Project-Based_Learning_Sustaining_the_Doing_Supporting_the_Learning"]}
