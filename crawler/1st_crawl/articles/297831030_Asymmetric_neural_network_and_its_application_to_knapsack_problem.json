{"id":"297831030_Asymmetric_neural_network_and_its_application_to_knapsack_problem","abstract":"We propose an asymmetric neural network which can solve inequality-constrained combinatorial optimization problems that are difficult to solve using symmetric neural networks. In this article, a knapsack problem that is one of such the problem is solved using the proposed network. Additionally, we study condition for obtaining a valid solution. In computer simulations, we show that the condition is correct and that the proposed network produces better solutions than the simple greedy algorithm.","authors":["Akira Yamamoto","Masaya Ohta","Hiroshi Ueda","Akio Ogihara"],"meta":["March 1995"],"references":[]}
