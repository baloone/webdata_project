{"id":"328664063_A_theory_of_reversibility_for_Erlang","abstract":"In a reversible language, any forward computation can be undone by a finite sequence of backward steps. Reversible computing has been studied in the context of different programming languages and formalisms, where it has been used for testing and verifica- tion, among others. In this paper, we consider a subset of Erlang, a functional and concurrent programming language based on the actor model. We present a formal semantics for reversible computation in this language and prove its main properties, including its causal consistency. We also build on top of it a rollback operator that can be used to undo the actions of a process up to a given checkpoint.","authors":["Ivan Lanese","Naoki Nishida","Adrian Palacios","German Vidal"],"meta":["November 2018Journal of Logical and Algebraic Methods in Programming 100:71-97","DOI:10.1016/j.jlamp.2018.06.004","Projects: ConcurrencyProgram debuggingReversible Computing"],"references":["278623175_Causal-Consistent_Reversibility","275103612_Reversible_session-based_Pi-calculus","261157289_A_Compositional_Semantics_for_the_Reversible_p-Calculus","228796126_Reversible_Communicating_Concurrent_Systems","222555759_Reversible_Computation_and_Reversible_Programming_Languages","221241399_Bidirectionalization_transformation_based_on_automatic_derivation_of_view_complement_functions","221211414_A_unified_semantics_for_future_Erlang","327128930_Declarative_debugging_of_concurrent_Erlang_programs","313346400_Let_it_recover_multiparty_protocol-induced_recovery","312628416_Logical_reversibility_of_computation","308386570_Causal-consistent_rollback_in_a_tuple-based_language","307785815_Interpretation_and_programming_of_the_reversible_functional_language_RFUN","287135226_Irreversibility_and_heat_generation_in_the_computing_process","278828881_Reversibility_in_the_higher-order_p-calculus","222783480_Reversing_Algebraic_Process_Calculi","221151049_Principles_of_a_reversible_programming_language","221150951_Introduction_to_reversible_computing_Motivation_progress_and_challenges","220997796_Transactors_A_programming_model_for_maintaining_globally_consistent_distributed_in_unreliable_environments","220693831_Term_Rewriting_and_All_That","220498342_Notes_on_the_history_of_reversible_computation","220430499_Tree-Manipulating_Systems_and_Church-Rosser_Theorems","2386785_A_Framework_for_Reasoning_about_ERLANG"]}
