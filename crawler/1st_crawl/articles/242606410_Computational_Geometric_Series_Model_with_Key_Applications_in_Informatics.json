{"id":"242606410_Computational_Geometric_Series_Model_with_Key_Applications_in_Informatics","abstract":"The current paper presents an innovative Digital Computing Model using Geometric Series and its Formulae (GSF). The generic computing model and GSF are mostly used in various scientific research fields such as information & communication technology, digital signal processing, engineering, medicine, bioinformatics, etc. particularly in computing model that performs infinitely many computational steps in finite time. In the research study, a generalized theorem, which is named as a generic digital computing-geometric series model, has been introduced and analyzed with key applications. The generalized theorem has been derived from the basic equation x = y, where x or y denotes a power of two. The digital computing-geometric series model will be very useful for researchers working on science and engineering fields for finding solutions to the real world complex problems.","authors":["C.
