{"id":"325615739_The_Role_of_Operational_Research_in_Green_Freight_Transportation","abstract":"Recent years have witnessed an increased awareness of the negative external impacts of freight transportation. The field of Operational Research (OR) has, particularly in the recent years, continued to contribute to alleviating the negative impacts through the use of various optimization models and solution techniques. This paper presents the basic principles behind and an overview of the existing body of recent research on ‘greening’ freight transportation using OR-based planning techniques. The particular focus is on studies that have been described for two heavily used modes for transporting freight across the globe, namely road (including urban and electric vehicles) and maritime transportation, although other modes are also briefly discussed.","authors":["Tolga Bektaş","Jan Fabian Ehmke","Harilaos N Psaraftis","Jakob Puchinger"],"meta":["June 2018European Journal of Operational Research 274(3)","DOI:10.1016/j.ejor.2018.06.001","Project: Green maritime logistics"],"references":["323999744_Time-Dependent_Quickest_Path_Problem_with_Emission_Minimization","322237469_Evaluation_of_Alternative_Paths_for_Reliable_Routing_in_City_Logistics","318252658_An_Exact_Algorithm_for_the_Green_Vehicle_Routing_Problem","318238411_Multicriteria_Stochastic_Shortest_Path_Problem_for_Electric_Vehicles","353199482_Modeling_Tankers'_Optimal_Speed_and_Emissions","319890195_An_Adaptive_Large_Neighborhood_Search_for_the_Location-routing_Problem_with_Intra-route_Facilities","318695860_Enabling_a_Freight_Traffic_Controller_for_Collaborative_Multidrop_Urban_Logistics_Practical_and_Theoretical_Challenges","317970969_A_Simulation_Based_Restricted_Dynamic_Programming_Approach_for_the_Green_Time_Dependent_Vehicle_Routing_Problem","317022717_A_Multicriteria_Analysis_for_the_Green_VRP_A_Case_Discussion_for_the_Distribution_Problem_of_a_Spanish_Retailer","316145009_Time-Dependent_Green_Vehicle_Routing_Problem_With_Stochastic_Vehicle_Speeds_An_Approximate_Dynamic_Programming_Algorithm","315319115_The_implications_of_the_new_sulphur_limits_on_the_European_Ro-Ro_sector","315650372_Energy-efficient_shortest_routes_for_electric_and_hybrid_vehicles","315595675_A_multiple_ship_routing_and_speed_optimization_problem_under_time_cost_and_environmental_objectives","315531546_Investing_in_logistics_facilities_today_to_reduce_routing_emissions_tomorrow","315464571_Adaptive_Routing_and_Recharging_Policies_for_Electric_Vehicles"]}
