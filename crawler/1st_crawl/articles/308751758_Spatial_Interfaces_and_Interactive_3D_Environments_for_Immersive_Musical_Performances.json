{"id":"308751758_Spatial_Interfaces_and_Interactive_3D_Environments_for_Immersive_Musical_Performances","abstract":"The power of interactive 3D graphics, immersive displays, and spatial interfaces is still under-explored in domains where the main target is to enhance creativity and emotional experiences. This article presents a set of work the attempts to extent the frontiers of music creation as well as the experience of audiences attending to digital performances. The goal is to connect sounds to interactive 3D graphics that musicians can interact with and the audience can observe.","authors":["Florent Berthaut","Martin Hachet"],"meta":["September 2016IEEE engineering in medicine and biology magazine: the quarterly magazine of the Engineering in Medicine & Biology Society 36(5):82-87","DOI:10.1109/MCG.2016.96"],"references":["280853049_Reflets_Combining_and_Revealing_Spaces_for_Musical_Performances","277669137_Liveness_Through_the_Lens_of_Agency_and_Causality","257260778_Rouages_Revealing_the_Mechanisms_of_Digital_Musical_Instruments_to_the_Audience","243774325_Mapping_Strategies_for_Musical_Performance","232909243_Interacting_with_3D_Reactive_Widgets_for_Musical_Performance","47615800_DRILE_an_immersive_environment_for_hierarchical","47615798_Combining_Audiovisual_Mappings_For_3D_Musical_Interaction","270819482_Musique_geste_technologie"]}
