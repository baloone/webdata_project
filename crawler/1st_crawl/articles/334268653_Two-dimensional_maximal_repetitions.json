{"id":"334268653_Two-dimensional_maximal_repetitions","abstract":"Maximal repetitions or runs in strings have a wide array of applications and thus have been extensively studied. In this paper, we extend this notion to 2-dimensions, precisely defining a maximal 2D repetition. We provide initial bounds on the number of maximal 2D repetitions that can occur in an n×n array. The main contribution of this paper is the presentation of the first algorithm for locating all maximal 2D repetitions. The algorithm is efficient and straightforward, with runtime O(n2log⁡n+ρ), where n2 is the size of the input array and ρ is the number of maximal 2D repetitions in the output.","authors":["Amihood Amir","Gad Landau","Shoshana Marcus","Dina Sokol"],"meta":["July 2019Theoretical Computer Science 812(50)","DOI:10.1016/j.tcs.2019.07.006"],"references":["309008902_Computing_All_Distinct_Squares_in_Linear_Time_for_Integer_Alphabets","258849598_Internal_Pattern_Matching_Queries_in_a_Text_and_Applications","226887935_Squares_cubes_and_time-space_efficient_string_searching","221591625_Rapid_Identification_of_Repeated_Patterns_in_Strings_Trees_and_Arrays","319975129_The_Runs_Theorem","282067300_Coverability_in_Two_Dimensions","280618755_Primitive_roots_of_bi-periodic_infinite_pictures","262805753_A_new_characterization_of_maximal_repetitions_by_Lyndon_trees","234017870_2D_Lyndon_Words_and_Applications","229067720_On-Line_Construction_of_Suffix_Trees","223589104_Optimal_discovery_of_repetitions_in_2D","222878384_Fast_Parallel_and_Serial_Approximate_String_Matching","222519954_Repetitions_in_strings_Algorithms_and_combinatorics","220149574_Fibonacci_arrays_and_their_two-dimensional_repetitions","47842905_A_Constant_Time_Optimal_Parallel_Algorithm_for_Two-Dimensional_Pattern_Matching","29869167_Linear_time_algorithms_for_finding_and_representing_all_the_tandem_repeats_in_a_string","3832192_Finding_Maximal_Repetitions_in_a_Word_in_Linear_Time","2448617_Two-Dimensional_Periodicity_in_Rectangular_Arrays"]}
