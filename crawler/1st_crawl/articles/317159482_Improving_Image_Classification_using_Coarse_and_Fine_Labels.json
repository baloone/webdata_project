{"id":"317159482_Improving_Image_Classification_using_Coarse_and_Fine_Labels","abstract":"The performance of classifiers is in general improved by designing models with a large number of parameters or by ensembles. We tackle the problem of classification of coarse and fine grained categories, which share a semantic relationship. On being given the predictions that a classifier has for a given test sample, we adjust the probabilities according to the semantics of the categories, on which the classifier was trained. We present an algorithm for doing such an adjustment and we demonstrate improvement for both coarse and fine grained classification. We evaluate our method using convolutional neural networks. However, the algorithm can be applied to any classifier which outputs category wise probabilities.","authors":["Anuvabh Dutt","Denis Pellerin","Georges Quenot"],"meta":["June 2017","DOI:10.1145/3078971.3079042","Conference: the 2017 ACM"],"references":["319770123_Densely_Connected_Convolutional_Networks","306885833_Densely_Connected_Convolutional_Networks","320967941_YOLO9000_Better_Faster_Stronger","319770414_Identity_Mappings_in_Deep_Residual_Networks","311925600_YOLO9000_Better_Faster_Stronger","308834529_Classifier_adaptation_at_prediction_time","308277201_Identity_Mappings_in_Deep_Residual_Networks","306218037_Learning_multiple_layers_of_features_from_tiny_images","269935358_Striving_for_Simplicity_The_All_Convolutional_Net","265748773_Learning_Multiple_Layers_of_Features_from_Tiny_Images","262248303_Latent_Task_Adaptation_with_Large-Scale_Hierarchies","221363780_Hierarchical_semantic_indexing_for_large_scale_image_retrieval"]}
