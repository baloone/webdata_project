{"id":"264469759_Unstructured_Light_Fields","abstract":"We present a system for interactively acquiring and rendering light fields using a hand-held commodity camera. The main challenge we address is assisting a user in achieving good coverage of the 4D domain despite the challenges of hand-held acquisition. We define coverage by bounding reprojection error between viewpoints, which accounts for all 4 dimensions of the light field. We use this criterion together with a recent Simultaneous Localization and Mapping technique to compute a coverage map on the space of viewpoints. We provide users with real-time feedback and direct them toward under-sampled parts of the light field. Our system is lightweight and has allowed us to capture hundreds of light fields. We further present a new rendering algorithm that is tailored to the unstructured yet dense data we capture. Our method can achieve piecewise-bicubic reconstruction using a triangulation of the captured viewpoints and subdivision rules applied to reconstruction weights.","authors":["Abe Davis","Marc Levoy","Fredo Durand"],"meta":["May 2012Computer Graphics Forum 31(2pt1)","DOI:10.1111/j.1467-8659.2012.03009.x"],"references":["246688556_Light_Field_Photography_with_a_Hand-Held_Plenopic_Camera","239975042_Estimating_uncertainty_in_dense_stereo_disparity_maps","221364612_Accurate_Dense_and_Robust_Multi-View_Stereopsis","221304657_Iso-disparity_Surfaces_for_General_Stereo_Configurations","221110080_Calibration_of_Hand-Held_Camera_Sequences_for_Plenoptic_Modeling","220244980_Perception-Motivated_Interpolation_of_Image_Sequences","220184727_High_Performance_Imaging_Using_Large_Camera_Arrays","220050409_Focused_plenoptic_camera_and_rendering","215457338_Dappled_Photography_Mask_Enhanced_Cameras_for_Heterodyned_Light_Fields_and_Coded_Aperture_Refocusing","44683582_Accurate_Dense_and_Robust_Multiview_Stereopsis","38412938_Unstructured_Lumigraph_Rendering","34063709_Delaunay_Refinement_Mesh_Generation","3209121_Sea_of_Images","3192138_Occlusions_as_a_Guide_for_Planning_the_Next_View","2908246_The_Lumigraph","2376828_Exact_Evaluation_Of_Catmull-Clark_Subdivision_Surfaces_At_Arbitrary_Parameter_Values","271418374_Axial-cones","269033778_Photo_tourism","227691644_Virtual_Video_Camera_Image-Based_Viewpoint_Navigation_Through_Space_and_Time","224136697_A_sensor-based_solution_to_the_next_best_view_problem","220720968_Plenoptic_sampling","220505876_View_and_Time_Interpolation_in_Image_Space","220184543_Finding_paths_through_the_World's_photos","220184010_Axial-Cones_Modeling_Spherical_Catadioptric_Cameras_for_Wide-Angle_Light_Field_Rendering","34370377_Smooth_Subdivision_Surfaces_Based_on_Triangles","4334429_Parallel_Tracking_and_Mapping_for_Small_AR_Workspaces","3191984_Single_Lens_Stereo_with_a_Plenoptic_Camera","3114614_Fuzzy_model-reference_adaptive_control","2876471_Light_Field_Rendering","2826037_Plenoptic_Modeling_and_Rendering_from_Image_Sequences_Taken_by_a_Hand-Held_Camera","2501708_Dynamically_Reparameterized_Light_Fields","2395649_Subdivision_Methods_for_Geometric_Design"]}
