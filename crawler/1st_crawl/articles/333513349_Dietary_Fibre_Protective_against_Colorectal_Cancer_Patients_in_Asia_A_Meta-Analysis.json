Pooled odds ratios (OR) were calculated with fixed and random-effect models. Publication bias was visually evaluated by using funnel plots and statistically assessed through Egger’s and Begg’s tests. Data were processed using Review Manager 5.3 (RevMan 5.3) and Stata version 14.2 (Stata Corporation).\n\nRESULTS: This study reviewed 405 articles. There are 10 studies conducted a systematic review and continued with Meta-analysis of relevant data with several sample 49,964 patients. The results showed dietary fibre protective against colorectal cancer patients in Asia (OR = 0.66 [95% CI 0.56-0.77, p=0.008]). There was significant publication bias for studies included in dietary fibre protective against colorectal cancer patients in Asia.\n\nCONCLUSION: This analysis confirmed dietary fibre protective against colorectal cancer patients in Asia.","authors":["Masrul Masrul","Ricvan Dana Nindrea"],"meta":["May 2019Open Access Macedonian Journal of Medical Sciences 9(10)","DOI:10.3889/oamjms.2019.265"],"references":["324588157_Dietary_Fiber_Intake_and_Metabolic_Syndrome_Risk_Factors_among_Young_South_African_Adults","322129702_Breast_Cancer_Risk_From_Modifiable_and_Non-Modifiable_Risk_Factors_among_Women_in_Southeast_Asia_A_Meta-Analysis","313429001_Dietary_fibre_whole_grains_and_risk_of_colorectal_cancer_Systematic_review_and_dose-response_meta-analysis_of_prospective_studies","309723264_Dietary_fibre_intake_and_risk_of_breast_cancer_A_systematic_review_and_meta-analysis_of_epidemiological_studies","265910611_Income_and_RaceEthnicity_Influence_Dietary_Fiber_Intake_and_Vegetable_Consumption","261182497_Dietary_Fiber_and_Fiber_Fraction_Intakes_and_Colorectal_Cancer_Risk_in_Chinese_Adults","331300458_Protective_Effect_of_Omega-3_Fatty_Acids_in_Fish_Consumption_Against_Breast_Cancer_in_Asian_Patients_A_Meta-Analysis","288802810_The_Newcastle-Ottawa_Scale_NOS_for_Assessing_The_Quality_of_Nonrandomised_Studies_in_Meta-analyses","280997782_Dietary_fiber_intake_and_risk_of_colorectal_cancer_and_incident_and_recurrent_adenoma_in_the_Prostate_Lung_Colorectal_and_Ovarian_Cancer_Screening_Trial","277087686_Dietary_Fibre_and_the_Risk_of_Colorectal_Cancer_a_Case-Control_Study"]}
