(CBIR) is one of the\nfundamental research challenges extensively studied in the\nmultimedia community for decades Search the image\nthrough an analysis of modern technologies to the eye can\nanalyze content and this target . At present, (CBIR) has\nbecome one of the most advanced fields in computer\nscience because availability of a huge database which\ncontains a large amount of images available on the\nInternet, wherefore, It was very important of extract\nfeatures from images to support image search, In this\npaper, we will give a brief study on how to retrieve\nthe image depending on the content of what is the\nmost important studies on important topics in\nparticular is the most famous and experience.","authors":["Huthaefa Alkhazraj"],"meta":["August 2017Image Processing, IET IEEE(image processing):8"],"references":["278403101_Content_Based_Image_Retrieval_Using_Color_Texture_and_Shape","266506458_Content_Based_Image_Retrieval_using_Color_and_Texture","262487366_Optimization_of_Information_Retrieval_for_Cross_Media_contents_in_a_Best_Practice_Network","228719004_Human-centered_content-based_image_retrieval","281306610_Content_Based_Image_Retrieval_using_Color_Histogram","261212184_An_introduction_to_content-based_image_retrieval","251403306_Fundamentals_of_Content-Based_Image_and_Video_Retrieval","247695131_System_Identification_Toolbox_User''s_Guide","47713545_A_METHOD_OF_CONTENT-BASED_IMAGE_RETRIEVAL_FOR_THE_GENERATION_OF_IMAGE_MOSAICS","37538701_Content-based_image_retrieval_of_museum_images","2874013_Image_Retrieval_Using_Natural_Language_and_Content-Based_Techniques","2352627_Modern_Information_Retrieval","2427337_Content-Based_Image_Retrieval_with_Self-Organizing_Maps"]}
