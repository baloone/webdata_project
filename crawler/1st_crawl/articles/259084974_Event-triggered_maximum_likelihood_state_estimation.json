{"id":"259084974_Event-triggered_maximum_likelihood_state_estimation","abstract":"The event-triggered state estimation problem for linear time-invariant systems is considered in the framework of Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation in this paper. We show that the optimal estimate is parameterized by a special time-varying Riccati equation, and the computational complexity increases exponentially with respect to the time horizon. For ease in implementation, a one-step event-based ML estimation problem is further formulated and solved, and the solution behaves like a Kalman filter with intermittent observations. For the one-step problem, the calculation of upper and lower bounds of the communication rates from the process side is also briefly analyzed. An application example to sensorless event-based estimation of a DC motor system is presented and the benefits of the obtained one-step event-based estimator are demonstrated by comparative simulations.","authors":["Dawei Shi","Tongwen Chen","Ling Shi"],"meta":["January 2014Automatica 50(1)","DOI:10.1016/j.automatica.2013.10.005"],"references":["267304628_Time_and_Event-based_Sensor_Scheduling_for_Networks_with_Limited_Communication_Resources","260661914_Event-Based_Sensor_Data_Scheduling_Trade-Off_Between_Communication_Rate_and_Estimation_Quality","225075468_Feedback_Control_Of_Dynamic_Systems","224700629_Multiple_Sampling_for_Estimation_on_a_Finite_Horizon","224626929_Optimal_Estimation_with_Limited_Measurements","224256163_Kalman_Filtering_With_Intermittent_Observations_Tail_Distribution_and_Critical_Value","222534027_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_A_Survey","3218606_Sensorless_Control_of_Induction_Machines-With_or_Without_Signal_Injection","3031905_Kalman_Filtering_With_Intermittent_Observations","2986040_Sensorless_control_induction_motor_drive","308719946_Event-Based_State_Estimation_With_Variance-Based_Triggering","281423729_Receding_horizon_recursive_state_estimation","268221703_Comparison_of_Riemann_and_Lebesgue_sampling_for_first_order_stochastic_systems","261081763_Event-Based_State_Estimation_With_Variance-Based_Triggering","260661601_Event_Based_State_Estimation_With_Time_Synchronous_Updates","245775540_Constrained_Control_and_Estimation-An_Optimisation_Approach","236183262_Wireless_Medium_Access_Control_and_Physical_Layer_Specifications_for_Low-Rate_Wireless_Personal_Area_Networks_IEEE","229439308_Maximum_Likelihood_Estimates_of_Linear_Dynamic_Systems","228859937_Performance_and_average_sampling_period_of_sub-optimal_triggering_event_in_event_triggered_state_estimation","224739998_Comparison_of_Riemann_and_Lebesgue_sampling_for_first_order_stochastic_systems","224162455_Event-triggered_state_estimation_in_vector_linear_processes","222699638_Constrained_Linear_State_Estimation-A_Moving_Horizon_Approach","220692275_Nonlinear_programming_Theory_and_algorithms_2_ed","24374636_Adaptive_Sampling_for_Linear_State_Estimation","3939832_Low_cost_sensorless_control_of_brushless_DC_motors_with_improved_speed_range","3717260_Robust_DC-motor_speed_control_without_any_mechanical_sensor","3431121_Integrated_smart_sensor_networking_framework_for_sensor-based_appliances","3280499_Low-Cost_Sensorless_Control_of_Brushless_DC_Motors_With_Improved_Speed_Range","3115255_Optimal_Filtering","3031421_Receding-horizon_estimation_for_discrete-time_linear_systems","2956184_Guest_Editors'_Introduction_Overview_of_Sensor_Networks"]}
