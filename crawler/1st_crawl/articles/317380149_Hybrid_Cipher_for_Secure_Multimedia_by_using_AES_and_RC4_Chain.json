{"id":"317380149_Hybrid_Cipher_for_Secure_Multimedia_by_using_AES_and_RC4_Chain","abstract":"With development, technology, computer science , computer networks and transmission of multimedia between two or more parts, a security of multimedia becomes an essential issue since most of the systems became easy to attack. In this newspaper, we suggest a model to Hybrid Cipher for Secure Multimedia by using AES and RC4 Chain. The analysis and evaluate the performance of this model is measured by testing several parameters. Show The resulting multimedia is found to be more distorted in hybrid Cipher","authors":["Kassim Mohammed Awad","Ali M Sagheer","Ayoob Abdulmunem Abdulhameed"],"meta":["June 2017Computers, informatics, nursing: CIN 43(1):5","DOI:10.25195/2017/4318"],"references":["257879537_Comparative_Study_of_Digital_Audio_Steganography_Techniques","220354258_Techniques_for_Data_Hiding","304071640_On_the_inadequacy_of_the_logistic_map_for_cryptographic_applications","267955458_Speech_Coder_using_Line_Spectral_Frequencies_of_Cascaded_Second_Order_Predictors","248795389_Speech_Coding_Algorithms_Foundation_and_Evolution_of_Standardized_Codecs","245111207_Theory_for_multi-resolution_signal_decomposition_-_The_wavelet_representation","237104478_The_Fast_Fourier_Transform_and_Its_Applications","220449816_An_Efficient_Block_Encryption_Cipher_Based_on_Chaotic_Maps_for_Secure_Multimedia_Applications"]}
