{"id":"340891630_A_Survey_Cryptographic_Hash_Functions_for_Digital_Stamping","abstract":"The current study aims to examine a general overview of the application of hash functions in cryptography and study the relationships between cryptographic hash functions and uses of the digital signature. Functions of the cryptographic hash are an important tool applied in several sections of data security, and application of hash function is common and used for various purposes such as File Integrity Verification, Key Derivation, Time stamping, Password Hashing, Rootkit Detection and Digital Signature. Digital Signature is a code that is linked electronically with the document including the sender's identity. Therefore, the digital signature is of high value in verifying digital messages or documents. Cryptographic hash functions do not present without mathematics. The success of computer science is attributed to mathematics; in other words, it is because of mathematical science, that computer science was understood and could be explained to all. The study aims to teach the reader hash functions and its applications such as digital signature and to show in details some hash functions and their designing.","authors":["Israa Ezzat Salem","Adil M.
