{"id":"237002414_Screening_of_Lactobacillus_Isolated_from_Pork_Sausages_for_Potential_Probiotic_Use_and_Evaluation_of_the_Microbiological_Safety_of_Fermented_Products","abstract":"The aim of this study was to select strains of Lactobacillus isolated from pork sausage for use as probiotics. Lactobacillus isolates were evaluated in tests based on probiotic characteristics and microbiological safety. The UFLA SAU 14, 52, and 91 isolates were differentiated by coaggregation with Listeria monocytogenes, production of lactic acid, and survival at pH 2. UFLA SAU 172 and 187 isolates had high levels of coaggregation with Salmonella Typhi and Escherichia coli, tolerance to pancreatic fluid, and adhesion to chloroform. UFLA SAU 20 and 34 isolates were characterized by exopolysaccharide production, autoaggregation, and resistance to simulated intestinal fluid. UFLA SAU 185, 238, and 258 isolates exhibited resistance to bile and adhesion to xylene. A cocktail of these 10 Lactobacillus isolates with potential probiotic properties was inoculated into pork sausage and inhibited the growth of L. monocytogenes.","authors":["Francesca Silva Dias","Whasley Ferreira Duarte","Marianna Rabelo Rios Martins Santos","Eduardo Ramos"],"meta":["June 2013Journal of Food Protection 76(6):991-998","DOI:10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-12-491","SourcePubMed"],"references":["273691613_Health_effects_of_probiotics_and_prebiotics_A_literature_review_on_human_studies","248565167_Properties_of_potential_probiotic_Lactobacillus_plantarum_strains","239551544_Avaliacao_higienico-sanitaria_de_linguicas_tipo_frescal_comercializadas_nos_municipios_de_Tres_Coracoes_e_Lavras_MG","51775815_Selection_of_Lactobacillus_strains_from_fermented_sausages_for_their_use_as_probiotics","44663296_Improving_functional_value_of_meat_products","30485551_Screening_and_characterization_of_Lactobacillus_strains_producing_large_amounts_of_exopolysaccharides","14075553_Cell_surface_characteristics_of_Lactobacillus_casei_subsp_casei_Lactobacillus_paracasei_subsp_paracasei_and_Lactobacillus_rhamnosus_strains","248511686_Screening_of_potential_probiotic_properties_of_Lactobacillus_fermentum_isolated_from_traditional_dairy_products","227701073_Adhesion_and_Aggregation_Ability_of_Probiotic_Strain_Lactobacillus_acidophilus_M92","223522557_Prevalence_genetic_characterization_and_antimicrobial_resistance_of_Salmonella_isolated_from_fresh_pork_sausages_in_Porto_Alegre_Brazil","223099031_Bacteriocin-producing_lactobacilli_in_Spanish-style_fermented_sausages_Characterization_of_bacteriocins","223035257_Antagonistic_activity_of_lactic_acid_bacteria_against_Listeria_monocytogenes_in_sliced_cooked_cured_pork_shoulder_stored_under_vacuum_or_modified_atmosphere_at_42C","222150097_Characterization_and_selection_of_Lactobacillus_saki_strains_isolated_from_traditional_dry_sausage_for_their_potential_use_as_starter_cultures","51781953_Aminogenesis_control_in_fermented_sausages_manufactured_with_pressurized_meat_batter_and_starter_culture","51781849_Utilization_of_microbes_to_process_and_preserve_meat","51781762_Effect_of_starter_culture_spice_mix_and_storage_time_and_temperature_on_biogenic_amine_content_of_dry_fermented_sausages","51777346_Probiotics_in_fermented_sausage","51776241_Potential_probiotic_Lactobacillus_strains_from_fermented_sausages_Further_investigations_on_their_probiotic_properties","51124512_Application_of_Lactobacillus_fermentum_HL57_and_Pediococcus_acidilactici_SP979_as_potential_probiotics_in_the_manufacture_of_Traditional_Iberian_dry-fermented_sausages","47811461_Mixed_species_biofilms_of_Listeria_monocytogenes_and_Lactobacillus_plantarum_show_enhanced_resistance_to_benzalkonium_chloride_and_peracetic_acid","46107314_New_perspective_for_Lactobacilli_exopolysaccharides","43341129_Safety_and_functional_aspects_of_pre-selected_lactobacilli_for_probiotic_use_in_Iberian_dry-fermented_sausages","38089660_Non-dairy_probiotic_products","23422696_Surface_physicochemical_analysis_of_natural_Lactolactis_strains_reveals_the_existence_of_hydrophobic_and_low_charged_strains_with_altered_adhesive_properties","13710201_Vancomycin_susceptibility_as_an_aid_to_the_identification_of_lactobacilli","13414794_Antibiotic_Susceptibility_of_Potentially_Probiotic_Lactobacillus_Species","13063496_Heteropolysaccharides_from_lactic_acid_bacteria","12204405_Adhesion_autoaggregation_and_hydrophobicity_of_13_strains_of_Bifidobacterium_longum","12166233_Probiotic_bacteria_Safety_functional_and_technological_properties","11042591_Identification_and_antibiotic_resistance_of_isolates_from_probiotic_products","10971182_Susceptibility_of_Lactobacillus_spp_To_antimicrobial_agents","10824084_Probiotic_and_milk_technological_properties_of_Lactobacillus_brevis","7479910_Antibiotic_resistance_in_food_lactic_acid_bacteria_-_A_review","7273983_The_survival_and_persistence_in_the_human_gastrointestinal_tract_of_five_potential_probiotic_lactobacilli_consumed_as_freeze-dried_cultures_or_as_probiotic_sausage","6964933_Diversity_stable_enrichment_culture_which_is_useful_for_silage_inoculant_and_its_succession_in_alfalfa_silage","6121232_Measurement_of_aggregation_properties_between_probiotics_and_pathogens_In_vitro_evaluation_of_different_methods"]}
