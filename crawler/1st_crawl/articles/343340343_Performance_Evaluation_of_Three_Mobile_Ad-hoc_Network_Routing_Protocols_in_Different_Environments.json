{"id":"343340343_Performance_Evaluation_of_Three_Mobile_Ad-hoc_Network_Routing_Protocols_in_Different_Environments","abstract":"Mobile ad-hoc wireless networks give us the high\nprobability and high properties to create networks, without\nany central management or infrastructure, independent and\ntemporary network, that is means wide ubiquitous networks.\nThe intermediate nodes should be able to communicate between\nthem to send and receive the data with ability using at any time\nand anywhere, the mobility of the intermediate node between\nthe source and destination gives us unstable topology maybe the\nconnection between the nodes will be break often. Therefore, the\nstrategies to design any wireless depend on path routing and\nprotocol selection. In this paper we study and evaluate the effect\nof mobility on the routing protocols DSDV, AODV and DSR in\ntwo different scenarios, the density of nodes and different area\nin NS2.35 simulation by using three performance metrics in the\nevaluating the routing protocols are Average Throughput, Packet\nDelivery Ratio and Average End-to-End Delay.","authors":["Ahmed Muhi Shantaf","Alaa Hamid Mohammed","Sefer Kurnaz"],"meta":["June 2020","DOI:10.1109/HORA49412.2020.9152845","Conference: 2020 International Congress on Human-Computer Interaction, Optimization and Robotic Applications (HORA)"],"references":["323196892_Design_and_performance_analysis_of_mobile_Ad_hoc_network_with_reactive_routing_protocols","319260298_Mobile_Ad_Hoc_Network_Energy_Cost_Algorithm_Based_on_Artificial_Bee_Colony","316531284_Performance_comparison_and_detailed_study_of_AODV_DSDV_DSR_TORA_and_OLSR_routing_protocols_in_ad_hoc_networks","316257334_An_Overview_of_MANETs_Applications_Characteristics_Challenges_and_Recent_Issues","270567959_Performance_Evaluation_of_AODV_and_DSDV_Routing_protocols_for_Ad-hoc_Networks","328082919_An_Investigational_Analysis_of_DSDV_AODV_and_DSR_Routing_Protocols_in_Mobile_Ad_Hoc_Networks","312569582_Comparative_performance_analysis_of_AODV_and_DSR_routing_protocols_under_wormhole_attack_in_mobile_ad_hoc_network_on_different_node's_speeds","46122450_Mobile_Ad_Hoc_Networking_Imperatives_and_Challenges"]}
