{"id":"343025488_Routing_space_exploration_for_scalable_routing_in_the_quantum_Internet","abstract":"The entangled network structure of the quantum Internet formulates a high complexity routing space that is hard to explore. Scalable routing is a routing method that can determine an optimal routing at particular subnetwork conditions in the quantum Internet to perform a high-performance and low-complexity routing in the entangled structure. Here, we define a method for routing space exploration and scalable routing in the quantum Internet. We prove that scalable routing allows a compact and efficient routing in the entangled networks of the quantum Internet.","authors":["Laszlo Gyongyosi","Sandor Imre"],"meta":["July 2020Scientific Reports 10(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-020-68354-y"],"references":["349578031_Quantum_Computer_Systems_for_Scientific_Discovery","349045564_Quantum_approximate_optimization_of_non-planar_graph_problems_on_a_planar_superconducting_processor","347177588_Efficient_Routing_for_Quantum_Key_Distribution_Networks","344979894_Demonstrating_a_Continuous_Set_of_Two-Qubit_Gates_for_Near-Term_Quantum_Algorithms","342367840_Entanglement_concentration_service_for_the_quantum_Internet","341366393_Towards_storage_rings_as_quantum_computers","341349587_Towards_a_Distributed_Quantum_Computing_Ecosystem","339857182_Quantum_State_Optimization_and_Computational_Pathway_Evaluation_for_Gate-Model_Quantum_Computers","339392205_Delocalized_information_in_quantum_networks","341635351_Approximate_approximation_on_a_quantum_annealer"]}
