The book takes an applied approach to testing and measurement tasks, mirroring the growing use of statistical methods and software in education, psychology, sociology, and other fields. It is suitable for graduate students in applied statistics and psychometrics and practitioners in education, health, and marketing. The book covers the foundations of classical test theory (CTT), test reliability, validity, and scaling as well as item response theory (IRT) fundamentals and IRT for dichotomous and polytomous items. The authors explore the latest IRT extensions, such as IRT models with covariates, multidimensional IRT models, IRT models for hierarchical and longitudinal data, and latent class IRT models. They also describe estimation methods and diagnostics, including graphical diagnostic tools, parametric and nonparametric tests, and differential item functioning. Stata and R software codes are included for each method. To enhance comprehension, the book employs real datasets in the examples and illustrates the software outputs in detail. The datasets are available on the authorsâ€™ web page.","authors":["Francesco Bartolucci","Silvia Bacci","Michela Gnaldi"],"meta":["July 2015","DOI:10.1201/b18735","Publisher: Chapman and Hall/CRC pressISBN: 9780429095252","Project: Psychometrics"],"references":[]}
