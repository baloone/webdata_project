{"id":"327646229_Generic_refinement_of_expressive_grammar_formalisms_with_an_application_to_discontinuous_constituent_parsing","abstract":"We formulate a generalization of Petrov et al. (2006)'s split/merge algorithm for interpreted regular tree grammars (Koller and Kuhlmann, 2011), which capture a large class of grammar formalisms. We evaluate its effectiveness empirically on the task of discontinuous constituent parsing with two mildly context-sensitive grammar formalisms: linear context-free rewriting systems (Vijay-Shanker et al., 1987) as well as hybrid grammars (Nederhof and Vogler, 2014).","authors":["Kilian Gebhardt"],"meta":["August 2018","Conference: 27th International Conference on Computational Linguistics (COLING)At: Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA"],"references":["329975837_Learning_to_Prune_Exploring_the_Frontier_of_Fast_and_Accurate_Parsing","322587524_Efficient_Discontinuous_Phrase-Structure_Parsing_via_the_Generalized_Maximum_Spanning_Arborescence","317485136_Hybrid_Grammars_for_Parsing_of_Discontinuous_Phrase_Structures_and_Non-Projective_Dependency_Structures","306094126_EM-Training_for_Weighted_Aligned_Hypergraph_Bimorphisms","306093849_Efficient_techniques_for_parsing_with_tree_automata","301581721_Data-Oriented_Parsing_with_Discontinuous_Constituents_and_Function_Tags","322583897_Neural_Discontinuous_Constituency_Parsing","318741667_Incremental_Discontinuous_Phrase_Structure_Parsing_with_the_GAP_Transition","306094183_Adaptive_Importance_Sampling_from_Finite_State_Automata","306094165_Discontinuous_parsing_with_continuous_trees"]}
