{"id":"263247466_IPAnema_A_family_of_Cable-Driven_Parallel_Robots_for_Industrial_Applications","abstract":"Nowadays there are very little robot systems in operation in the field of medium to large-scale handling and assembly mostly due to lack of repetitive processes or shortcomings in programming and configuring such robots. In this paper we introduce a family of cable-driven parallel robot called IPAnema that are designed for industrial processes. We address the system architecture, key components such as winches and controller, as well as design tools. Furthermore, some experimental data from the evaluation are presented to illustrate the performance of cable robots.","authors":["Andreas Pott","Hendrik MÃ¼therich","Werner Kraus","Valentin Schmidt"],"meta":["January 2013","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-31988-4_8","In book: Mechanisms and Machine Science (pp.119-134)Publisher: Springer Berlin HeidelbergEditors: Tobias Bruckmann, Andreas Pott","Project: Cable-driven Parallel Robots"],"references":["271100382_The_NIST_Spider_A_Robot_Crane","258844392_Kinematics_of_the_wire-driven_parallel_robot_MARIONET_using_linear_actuators","256445801_Optimal_design_of_dexterous_cable_driven_parallel_manipulators","251272913_An_Algorithm_for_Real-Time_Forward_Kinematics_of_Cable-Driven_Parallel_Robots","251136705_Human_Safety_Algorithms_for_a_Parallel_Cable-Driven_Haptic_Interface","291707562_Kinematic_analysis_of_a_6-DOF_wire-driven_parallel_kinematic_manipulator","245885482_Design_of_a_Parallel_Wire-Driven_Manipulator_for_Wind_Tunnels","245363279_Stiffness_Study_of_a_Parallel_Link_Robot_Crane_for_Shipbuilding_Applications","239616444_Determination_and_Management_of_Cable_Interferences_Between_Two_6DOF_Foot_Platforms_in_a_Cable-Driven_Locomotion_Interface","234040246_Geometric_Determination_of_the_Interference-Free_Constant-Orientation_Workspace_of_Parallel_Cable-Driven_Mechanisms"]}
