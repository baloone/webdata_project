{"id":"279633550_Accelerated_Parallel_and_Distributed_Algorithm_using_Limited_Internal_Memory_for_Nonnegative_Matrix_Factorization","abstract":"Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a powerful technique for dimension\nreduction, extracting latent factors and learning part-based representation.\nFor large datasets, NMF performance depends on some major issues: fast\nalgorithms, fully parallel distributed feasibility and limited internal memory.\nThis research aims to design a fast fully parallel and distributed algorithm\nusing limited internal memory to reach high NMF performance for large datasets.\nIn particular, we propose a flexible accelerated algorithm for NMF with all its\n$L_1$ $L_2$ regularized variants based on full decomposition, which is a\ncombination of an anti-lopsided algorithm and a fast block coordinate descent\nalgorithm. The proposed algorithm takes advantages of both these algorithms to\nachieve a linear convergence rate of $\\mathcal{O}(1-\\frac{1}{||Q||_2})^k$ in\noptimizing each factor matrix when fixing the other factor one in the sub-space\nof passive variables, where $r$ is the number of latent components; where\n$\\sqrt{r} \\leq ||Q||_2 \\leq r$. In addition, the algorithm can exploit the data\nsparseness to run on large datasets with limited internal memory of machines.\nFurthermore, our experimental results are highly competitive with 7\nstate-of-the-art methods about three significant aspects of convergence,\noptimality and average of the iteration number. Therefore, the proposed\nalgorithm is superior to fast block coordinate descent methods and accelerated\nmethods.","authors":["Duy Khuong Nguyen","Tu-Bao Ho"],"meta":["June 2017Journal of Global Optimization 68(2)","DOI:10.1007/s10898-016-0471-z","SourcearXiv"],"references":["277603468_Coordinate_Descent_Converges_Faster_with_the_Gauss-Southwell_Rule_Than_Random_Selection","271854792_Anti-lopsided_Algorithm_for_Large-scale_Nonnegative_Least_Square_Problems","259824199_The_Why_and_How_of_Nonnegative_Matrix_Factorization","258350768_Limited-Memory_Fast_Gradient_Descent_Method_for_Graph_Regularized_Nonnegative_Matrix_Factorization","313766392_When_does_non-negative_matrix_factorization_give_a_correct_decomposition_into_parts","279904668_Non-negative_Matrix_Factorization_with_Sparseness_Constraints","269021448_Inexact_block_coordinate_descent_methods_with_application_to_non-negative_matrix_factorization","265315220_Nonnegativity_Constraints_in_Numerical_Analysis","264423290_Solving_Least_Square_Problems","260324828_Nonnegative_Matrix_Factorization_A_Comprehensive_Review"]}
