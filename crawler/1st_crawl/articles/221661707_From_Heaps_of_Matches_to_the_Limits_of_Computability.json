{"id":"221661707_From_Heaps_of_Matches_to_the_Limits_of_Computability","abstract":"We study so-called invariant games played with a fixed number $d$ of heaps of\nmatches. A game is described by a finite list $\\mathcal{M}$ of integer vectors\nof length $d$ specifying the legal moves. A move consists in changing the\ncurrent game-state by adding one of the vectors in $\\mathcal{M}$, provided all\nelements of the resulting vector are nonnegative. For instance, in a two-heap\ngame, the vector $(1,-2)$ would mean adding one match to the first heap and\nremoving two matches from the second heap. If $(1,-2) \\in \\mathcal{M}$, such a\nmove would be permitted provided there are at least two matches in the second\nheap. Two players take turns, and a player unable to make a move loses. We show\nthat these games embrace computational universality, and that therefore a\nnumber of basic questions about them are algorithmically undecidable. In\nparticular, we prove that there is no algorithm that takes two games\n$\\mathcal{M}$ and $\\mathcal{M}'$ (with the same number of heaps) as input, and\ndetermines whether or not they are equivalent in the sense that every\nstarting-position which is a first player win in one of the games is a first\nplayer win in the other.","authors":["Urban Larsson","Johan WÃ¤stlund"],"meta":["February 2012The Electronic Journal of Combinatorics 20(3)","DOI:10.37236/2244","SourcearXiv","Project: Game Theory"],"references":["235356774_A_New_Kind_of_Science","221729310_Combinatorial_Games_with_a_Pass_A_dynamical_systems_approach","304405348_On_computable_numbers_with_an_application_to_the_Entscheidungsproblem","266702828_Winning_ways_for_your_mathematical_plays_Vol_4_2nd_ed","250763903_A_mathematical_investigation_of_games_of_take-away","239578559_Turing_AM_On_computable_numbers_with_an_application_to_the_Entscheidungs_problem_Proc_Lond_Math_Soc_Ser_2_42_230-265","222562010_Complexity_appeal_and_challenges_of_combinatorial_games","221664260_Two_variants_of_Wythoff's_game_preserving_its_P-positions","220152656_Rites_of_passage_Experiences_of_transition_for_forced_Hazara_migrants_and_refugees_in_Australia","220078015_Extensions_and_restrictions_of_Wythoff's_game_preserving_its_P_positions"]}
