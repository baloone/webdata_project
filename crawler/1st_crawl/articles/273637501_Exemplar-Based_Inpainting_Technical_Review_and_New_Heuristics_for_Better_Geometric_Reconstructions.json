{"id":"273637501_Exemplar-Based_Inpainting_Technical_Review_and_New_Heuristics_for_Better_Geometric_Reconstructions","abstract":"This paper proposes a technical review of exemplar-based inpainting approaches with a particular focus on greedy methods. Several comparative and illustrative experiments are provided to deeply explore and enlighten these methods, and to have a better understanding on the state-of-the-art improvements of these approaches. From this analysis three improvements over Criminisi et al. algorithm are then presented and detailed: 1) a tensor-based data term for a better selection of pixel candidates to fill in, 2) a fast patch lookup strategy to ensure a better global coherence of the reconstruction, and 3) a novel fast anisotropic spatial blending algorithm that reduces typical block artifacts using tensor models. Relevant comparisons to state-of-the-art inpainting methods are provided that exhibit the effectiveness of our contributions.","authors":["Pierre Buyssens","Maxime Daisy","David Tschumperl√©","Olivier Lezoray"],"meta":["March 2015IEEE Transactions on Image Processing 24(6)","DOI:10.1109/TIP.2015.2411437","SourcePubMed"],"references":["278769225_A_smarter_exemplar-based_inpainting_algorithm_using_local_and_global_heuristics_for_more_geometric_coherence","268153071_A_smarter_exemplar-based_inpainting_algorithm_using_local_and_global_heuristics_for_more_geometric_coherence","262275707_A_Fast_Spatial_Patch_Blending_Algorithm_for_Artefact_Reduction_in_Pattern-based_Image_Inpainting","314801352_Missing_data_correction_in_still_images_and_image_sequences","312451135_Vector-valued_image_regularization_with_PDEs_A_common_framework_for_different_applications","285744826_Sparse_representation_for_color_image_restoration","281018137_Image_decomposition_via_the_combination_of_sparse_representations_and_a_variational_approach","267683445_PatchWorks_Example-Based_Region_Tiling_for_Image_Editing","264957457_Oscillating_patterns_in_image_processing_and_nonlinear_evolution_equations_The_fifteenth_Dean_Jacqueline_B_Lewis_memorial_lectures","262329208_Statistics_of_Patch_Offsets_for_Image_Completion"]}
