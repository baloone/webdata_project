{"id":"319855586_Properties_of_the_Standard_Deviation_that_are_Rarely_Mentioned_in_Classrooms","abstract":"Unlike the mean, the standard deviation ¾ is a vague concept. In this paper, several properties of ¾ are highlighted. These properties include the minimum and the maximum of ¾, its relationship to the mean absolute deviation and the range of the data, its role in Chebyshev’s inequality and the coefficient of variation. The hidden information in the formula itself is extracted. The confusion about the denominator of the sample variance being n ¡ 1 is also addressed. Some properties of the sample mean and variance\nof normal data are carefully explained. Pointing out these and other properties in classrooms may have significant effects on the understanding and the retention of the concept.","authors":["Mohammad Fraiwan Al-Saleh","Adil Eltayeb Yousif"],"meta":["April 2016Austrian Journal of Statistics 38(3):193","DOI:10.17713/ajs.v38i3.272"],"references":["324346860_Introduction_to_the_Practice_of_Statistics","284532057_Introduction_to_Medical_Statistics","270254645_An_Introduction_to_Experimental_Design_and_Statistics_for_Biology","247646451_Statistics_For_The_Life_Sciences"]}
