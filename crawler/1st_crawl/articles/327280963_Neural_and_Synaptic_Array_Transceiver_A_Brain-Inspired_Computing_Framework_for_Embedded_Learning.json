{"id":"327280963_Neural_and_Synaptic_Array_Transceiver_A_Brain-Inspired_Computing_Framework_for_Embedded_Learning","abstract":"Embedded, continual learning for autonomous and adaptive behavior is a key application of neuromorphic hardware. However, neuromorphic implementations of embedded learning at large scales that are both flexible and efficient have been hindered by a lack of a suitable algorithmic framework. As a result, most neuromorphic hardware are trained off-line on large clusters of dedicated processors or GPUs and transferred post hoc to the device. We address this by introducing the neural and synaptic array transceiver (NSAT), a neuromorphic computational framework facilitating flexible and efficient embedded learning by matching algorithmic requirements and neural and synaptic dynamics. NSAT supports event-driven supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning algorithms including deep learning. We demonstrate the NSAT in a wide range of tasks, including the simulation of Mihalas-Niebur neuron, dynamic neural fields, event-driven random back-propagation for event-based deep learning, event-based contrastive divergence for unsupervised learning, and voltage-based learning rules for sequence learning. We anticipate that this contribution will establish the foundation for a new generation of devices enabling adaptive mobile systems, wearable devices, and robots with data-driven autonomy.","authors":["Georgios Detorakis"],"meta":["August 2018Frontiers in Neuroscience 12:583","DOI:10.3389/fnins.2018.00583"],"references":["326153381_Data_and_Power_Efficient_Intelligence_with_Neuromorphic_Learning_Machines","322548911_Loihi_A_Neuromorphic_Manycore_Processor_with_On-Chip_Learning","318391669_Obstacle_Avoidance_and_Target_Acquisition_for_Robot_Navigation_Using_a_Mixed_Signal_AnalogDigital_Neuromorphic_Processing_System","317284550_SuperSpike_Supervised_Learning_in_Multilayer_Spiking_Neural_Networks","331281915_Contrastive_Hebbian_learning_with_random_feedback_weights","324110517_Theory_for_the_development_of_neuron_selectivity_orientation_specificity_and_binocular_interaction_in_visual_cortex","322942663_Avoiding_the_Jordan_Canonical_Form_in_the_Discussion_of_Linear_Systems_with_Constant_Coefficients","320093763_Event-driven_random_backpropagation_Enabling_neuromorphic_deep_learning_machines","319770264_Regularization_of_Neural_Networks_using_DropConnect","313746122_A_note_on_the_generation_of_random_normal_deviates_Ann_Math_Statist_29","312157450_Membrane-Dependent_Neuromorphic_Learning_Rule_for_Unsupervised_Spike_Pattern_Detection","311715005_Event-Driven_Random_Back-Propagation_Enabling_Neuromorphic_Deep_Learning_Machines","313564761_A_hardware_random_number_generator_cryptographic_hardware_and_embedded_systems_-_CHES_2002","312965687_Membrane-dependent_neuromorphic_learning_rule_for_unsupervised_spike_pattern_detection","312965679_Forward_table-based_presynaptic_event-triggered_spike-timing-dependent_plasticity"]}
