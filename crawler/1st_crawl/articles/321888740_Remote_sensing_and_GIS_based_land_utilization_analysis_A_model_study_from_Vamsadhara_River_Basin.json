{"id":"321888740_Remote_sensing_and_GIS_based_land_utilization_analysis_A_model_study_from_Vamsadhara_River_Basin","abstract":"This study deals with the use of GIS and Remote sensing in mapping for change detection of Land Use/Land Cover (LU/LC) a model study of Vamsadhara River Basin of 2011 and 2016. So as to detect the changes that has taken place in this status between these periods. The result of the work shows in rapid growth of built-up land between 2011 and 2016. LU/LC classification has been done using ERDAS imagine 9.2 software. The supervised classification technique was used to increase in built-up area, open forest, plantation, and other lands. It is also noted that substantial amount of agriculture land, water spread area, and dense forest area vanished during the period of study which may be due to rapid urbanization of the study area.","authors":["K.R.
