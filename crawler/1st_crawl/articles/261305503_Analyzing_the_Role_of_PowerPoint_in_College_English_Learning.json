{"id":"261305503_Analyzing_the_Role_of_PowerPoint_in_College_English_Learning","abstract":"Modern high-tech products are being more widely used in College English teaching. PowerPoint presentation software is one representative of them. So while English teachers are using multimedia tools to design courseware to make presentations in teaching, is it practicable to enable students to make their own work by using presentation software such as PPT to finish their traditional English exercises in a completely new combination of oral English presentations and computer presentations?
