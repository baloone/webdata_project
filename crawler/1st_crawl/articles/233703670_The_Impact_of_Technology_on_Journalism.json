{"id":"233703670_The_Impact_of_Technology_on_Journalism","abstract":"This article proposes that changing technology influences journalism in at least four broad areas: (1) how journalists do their work; (2) the content of news; (3) the structure or organization of the newsroom; and (4) the relationships between or among news organizations, journalists and their many publics. Although new media such as the Internet, World Wide Web and digital video are perhaps the most visible examples of technologies that are transforming journalism, the history of journalism is in many ways defined by technological change. The article concludes with a proposed research agenda for the study of journalism and technological change.","authors":["John Pavlik"],"meta":["May 2000Journalism Studies 1(2):229-237","DOI:10.1080/14616700050028226"],"references":["247083659_Organizations_and_public_relations_Testing_a_communication_theory","209409672_The_Press_and_Foreign_Policy"]}
