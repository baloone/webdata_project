{"id":"287900673_The_effect_of_powerpoint_and_traditional_lectures_on_students'_achievement_in_physics","abstract":"The effect of PowerPoint in physics education is continuously debated, but both supporters and opponents have insufficient empirical evidence. PowerPoint's use in physics lectures has influenced investigations of its effects on student achievement (e.g., overall exam scores) in comparison to presentations based on traditional lectures (e.g., \"chalk-and-talk\"), and PowerPoint-assisted lectures. Thus far, comparisons of overall exam scores have received mixed results. The present study classifies overall exam scores into auditory, graphic and figures, and slides scores to reveal new insights into the effects of PowerPoint presentations (PPP) on student achievement. Analyses considered the success of the lecture information that was presented to students without the use of PowerPoint (i.e., traditional lectures), as well as auditory and visual information displayed on PowerPoint slides. Data were collected from 90 student teachers via pre- and post-tests. The students at experimental group who participated in lectures supported by PPPs had higher grades than the control group who were solely taught through traditional presentations. The present study supports the premise that the \"intelligent use\" of PPPs in physics instruction is capable of increasing the students' success.","authors":["N.
