{"id":"281425897_Layered_graph_logic_as_an_assertion_language_for_access_control_policy_models","abstract":"We describe a uniform logical framework, based on a bunched logic that combines classical additives and very weak multiplicatives,\nfor reasoning compositionally about access control policy models. We show how our approach takes account of the underlying\nsystem architecture, and so provides a way to identify and reason about how vulnerabilities may arise (and be removed) as\na result of the architecture of the system. We consider, using frame rules, how local properties of access control policies\nare maintained as the system architecture evolves.","authors":["Matthew Collinson","Kevin McDonald","David Pym"],"meta":["June 2015Journal of Logic and Computation 27(1)","DOI:10.1093/logcom/exv020"],"references":["267449370_Compositional_Security_Modelling","235043659_Integrity_Considerations_for_Secure_Computer_Systems","221603981_Detecting_and_Eliminating_the_Cascade_Vulnerability_Problem_from_Multilevel_Security_Networks_Using_Soft_Constraints","221354717_A_Calculus_for_Access_Control_in_Distributed_Systems","220910227_Authentication_in_Distributed_Systems_Theory_and_Practice","220697086_A_Modal_Logic_for_Role-Based_Access_Control","220593691_Access_control_via_belnap_logic_Intuitive_expressive_and_analyzable_policy_composition","220388029_A_Logical_and_Computational_Theory_of_Located_Resource","47561918_Relation_Based_Access_Control_Logic_and_Policies","304585077_The_Cascade_Vulnerability_Problem","279957000_Dynamic_Logic","275164306_A_Logic_of_Access_Control","270752720_Erratum_to_A_substructural_logic_for_layered_graphs","267170210_A_discipline_of_mathematical_systems_modelling","243777300_From_categorial_grammar_to_bilinear_logic","242917619_Sequent-Systems_and_Groupoid_Models_I","238736686_Fundamentals_of_Computer_Security_Technology","238672205_Secure_Computer_Systems_Unified_Exposition_and_Multics_Interpretation","234812520_An_Algebra_for_Composing_Access_Control_Policies","228668072_The_Semantics_of_BI_and_Resource_Tableaux","226287960_Algebra_and_logic_for_access_control","225838134_Sequent-systems_and_groupoid_models_II","225169582_S-COI_The_Secure_Conflicts_of_Interest_Model_for_Multilevel_Secure_Database_Systems","223426077_Graph-based_specification_of_access_control_policies","222670293_Expressiveness_and_complexity_of_graph_logic","222462918_Shortest_Paths_Without_a_Map","221174347_An_Algebra_for_Composing_Access_Control_Policies_in_Grid","221051957_Rewrite_Specifications_of_Access_Control_Policies_in_Distributed_Environments","220897656_A_Spatial_Logic_for_Querying_Graphs","220713890_Security_Policies_and_Security_Models","220713836_A_Comparison_of_Commercial_and_Military_Computer_Security_Policies","220568189_A_theory_of_decomposition_into_prime_factors_of_layered_interconnection_networks","220430894_Algebraic_Laws_for_Nondeterminism_and_Concurrency","220173294_Algebra_and_logic_for_resource-based_systems_modelling","213888004_A_lattice_model_of_secure_information_flow","200621929_Modern_Graph_Theory","38373144_The_Logic_of_Bunched_Implications","4021745_Logic_in_Access_Control","3965916_Separation_logic_A_logic_for_shared_mutable_data_structures","3500637_The_Chinese_Wall_security_policy","3437948_Embedding_Information_Security_into_the_Organization","2954252_Lattice-based_access_control_model","2752708_Security_Policy_Specification_Using_a_Graphical_Approach","2558732_Possible_Worlds_and_Resources_The_Semantics_of_BI"]}
