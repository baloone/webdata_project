{"id":"287261888_Community-based_endogamy_as_an_influence_indicator","abstract":"Evaluating researchers (individually or in groups) usually depends on qualifying their publications and influence. Here, we aid such crucial task by introducing two new metrics (C-Endo and Comb) that rely on the concept of endogamy for communities of authors who publish in conferences and journals, and produce patents. Endogamy here measures how tightly structured the groups of authors are within a community. We validate and evaluate the metrics by using real datasets, two ground-truth rankings and citation count. We also perform random sampling analysis to account for any unbalance from the ground-truth rankings. Overall, such a thorough evaluation shows that our metrics are successful in defining community-based endogamy as an influence indicator.","authors":["Thiago H. P.
