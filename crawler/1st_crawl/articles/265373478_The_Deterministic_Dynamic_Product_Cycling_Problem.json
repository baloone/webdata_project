{"id":"265373478_The_Deterministic_Dynamic_Product_Cycling_Problem","abstract":"In this paper we have formulated and analyzed the deterministic product cycling problem. We have explored the structure of Lagrangean relaxations of this problem, and their use in providing bounds for branch-and-bound algorithms. Such an approach successful to solved the multistage scheduling problem examined by P. Afentakis et al. and in the single item cycling problem, but results here are not as encouraging.","authors":["Uday S.
