{"id":"223806493_Developing_secure_data_warehouses_with_a_UML_extension","abstract":"Data Warehouses (DWs), Multidimensional (MD) Databases, and On-Line Analytical Processing Applications are used as a very powerful mechanism for discovering crucial business information. Considering the extreme importance of the information managed by these kinds of applications, it is essential to specify security measures from the early stages of the DW design in the MD modeling process, and enforce them. In the past years, some proposals for representing main MD modeling properties at the conceptual level have been stated. Nevertheless, none of these proposals considers security issues as an important element in its model, so they do not allow us to specify confidentiality constraints to be enforced by the applications that will use these MD models. In this paper, we will discuss the specific confidentiality problems regarding DWs as well as present an extension of the Unified Modeling Language for specifying security constraints in the conceptual MD modeling, thereby allowing us to design secure DWs. One key advantage of our approach is that we accomplish the conceptual modeling of secure DWs independently of the target platform where the DW has to be implemented, allowing the implementation of the corresponding DWs on any secure commercial database management system. Finally, we will present a case study to show how a conceptual model designed with our approach can be directly implemented on top of Oracle 10g.","authors":["Eduardo Fern√°ndez-Medina","Juan Trujillo","Rodolfo Villarroel","Mario Piattini"],"meta":["September 2007Information Systems 32(6):826-856","DOI:10.1016/j.is.2006.07.003","SourceDBLP"],"references":["313721960_YAM2_Yet_Another_Multidimensional_Model_An_extension_of_UML","313598450_Extending_the_UML_for_multidimensional_modeling","313579592_Multidimensional_modeling_with_UML_package_diagrams","243768234_A_pattern_language_for_security_models","242104189_Technical_opinion_Information_system_security_management_in_the_new_millennium","221581476_Conceptual_Multidimensional_Data_Model_Based_on_MetaCube","221509309_An_Object_Oriented_Multidimensional_Data_Model_for_OLAP","221269880_Multidimensional_Modeling_with_UML_Package_Diagrams","221269205_The_Entity-Relationship_Model_for_Multilevel_Security","221201467_Metadaten-gestutzter_Data-Warehouse-Entwurf_mit_ADAPTed_UML","220933940_Methodological_Framework_for_Data_Warehouse_Design","220933914_Towards_OLAP_Security_Design_-_Survey_and_Research_Issues","220868489_Extending_the_UML_for_Multidimensional_Modeling","220855076_NIST_model_for_role-based_access_control_Towards_a_unified_standard","220841963_View_security_as_the_basis_for_data_warehouse_security","220713485_Securing_OLAP_Data_Cubes_Against_Privacy_Breaches","220095043_The_Dimensional_Fact_Model_A_Conceptual_Model_for_Data_Warehouses","3965633_YAM2_yet_another_multidimensional_model_an_extension_of_UML","3764413_A_prototype_model_for_data_warehouse_security_based_on_metadata","3709533_A_security_concept_for_OLAP","313745789_Keeping_information_private_with_VPD","291647214_For_certain_eyes_only","285475230_Policies_models_and_mechanisms","277297505_Object_Management_Group_Inc_OMG_Unified_Modeling_Language_Specification_version_13","277293981_Security_In_Databases_A_Survey_Study","265780327_Non-Functional_Requirements_in_Software_Engineering","247951171_The_Practice_and_Promise_of_the_Model_Driven_Architecture","247079070_Oracle_Privacy_Security_Auditing","246152147_Extending_OCL_for_Secure_Database_Design","238711760_The_data_warehousing_toolkit","234783291_The_Object_Constraint_Language_Second_Edition_Getting_Your_Models_Ready_for_MDA","226887599_An_Object_Oriented_Multidimensional_Data_Model_for_OLAP","225172264_Designing_Secure_Databases_for_OLS","225149732_Extending_OCL_for_Secure_Database_Development","221470576_A_Model_of_Authorization_for_Object-Oriented_Databases_based_on_Object_Views","221464374_A_Framework_for_the_Classification_and_Description_of_Multidimensional_Data_Models","221366922_An_access_control_language_for_web_services","221269947_Extending_UML_for_Designing_Secure_Data_Warehouses","221269442_Extending_the_ER_Model_for_the_Multidimensional_Paradigm","221115348_Towards_Development_of_Secure_Systems_Using_UMLsec","221056946_Access_Control_Policies_Models_and_Mechanisms","221001859_Conceptual_multidimensional_data_model_based_on_object-oriented_metacube","220868409_UMLsec_Extending_UML_for_secure_systems_development","220868364_SecureUML_A_UML-based_modeling_language_for_model-driven_security","220841961_On_Modeling_and_Predicting_Query_Behavior_in_OLAP_Systems","220593693_The_Multilevel_Relational_MLR_Data_Model","220278896_MOMT_A_Multilevel_Object_Modeling_Technique_for_Designing_Secure_Database_Applications","3764408_Finding_your_way_through_multidimensional_data_models","3247819_Correctness_by_construction_developing_a_commercial_Secure_System","3187428_Modeling_Security-Relevant_Data_Semantics","2955554_Designing_Data_Warehouses_with_OO_Conceptual_Models","2902512_A_Pragmatic_Approach_to_Conceptual_Modeling_of_OLAP_Security","2624207_The_NIST_model_for_role-based_access_control","2574561_The_Entity-Relationship_Model_for_Multilevel_Security","2954526_Role_based_access_control_models_ieee_computer"]}
