{"id":"280826513_A_Context_Sensitive_Offloading_Scheme_for_Mobile_Cloud_Computing_Service","abstract":"Mobile cloud computing (MCC) has drawn significant research attention as the popularity and capability of mobile devices have been improved in recent years. In this paper, we propose a prototype MCC offloading system that considers multiple cloud resources such as mobile ad-hoc network, cloudlet and public clouds to provide a adaptive MCC service. We propose a context-aware offloading decision algorithm aiming to provide code offloading decisions at runtime on selecting wireless medium and which potential cloud resources as the offloading location based on the device context. We also conduct real experiments on the implemented system to evaluate the performance of the algorithm. Results indicate the system and embedded decision algorithm can select suitable wireless medium and cloud resources based on different context of the mobile devices, and achieve significant performance improvement.","authors":["Bowen Zhou","Amir Vahid Dastjerdi","Rodrigo N Calheiros","Satish Narayana Srirama"],"meta":["June 2015","DOI:10.1109/CLOUD.2015.119","Conference: IEEE CLOUD 2015"],"references":["261470014_Impact_of_Cloudlets_on_Interactive_Mobile_Cloud_Applications","241630442_ThinkAir_Dynamic_resource_allocation_and_parallel_execution_in_the_cloud_for_mobile_code_offloading","236855133_Heterogeneity_in_Mobile_Cloud_Computing_Taxonomy_and_Open_Challenges","235799124_Methods_of_cloud-path_selection_for_offloading_in_mobile_cloud_computing_systems","309201112_The_case_for_VM-based_cloudlets_in_mobile_computing","273515438_Handoff_Strategy_for_Improving_Energy_Efficiency_and_Cloud_Service_Availability_for_Mobile_Devices","269304872_Computational_Offloading_or_Data_Binding_Bridging_the_Cloud_Infrastructure_to_the_Proximity_of_the_Mobile_User","269302626_A_semi-Markovian_decision_process_based_control_method_for_offloading_tasks_from_mobile_devices_to_the_cloud","262311339_COMET_code_offload_by_migrating_execution_transparently","261393754_Context-aware_decision_engine_for_mobile_cloud_offloading"]}
