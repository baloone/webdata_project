{"id":"221671565_A_Note_on_a_Conjecture_for_Balanced_Elementary_Symmetric_BooleanFunctions","abstract":"In 2008, Cusick {\\it et al.} conjectured that certain elementary symmetric\nBoolean functions of the form $\\sigma_{2^{t+1}l-1, 2^t}$ are the only nonlinear\nbalanced ones, where $t$, $l$ are any positive integers, and\n$\\sigma_{n,d}=\\bigoplus_{1\\le i_1<...<i_d\\le n}x_{i_1}x_{i_2}...x_{i_d}$ for\npositive integers $n$, $1\\le d\\le n$. In this note, by analyzing the weight of\n$\\sigma_{n, 2^t}$ and $\\sigma_{n, d}$, we prove that ${\\rm wt}(\\sigma_{n,\nd})<2^{n-1}$ holds in most cases, and so does the conjecture. According to the\nremainder of modulo 4, we also consider the weight of $\\sigma_{n, d}$ from two\naspects: $n\\equiv 3({\\rm mod\\}4)$ and $n\\not\\equiv 3({\\rm mod\\}4)$. Thus, we\ncan simplify the conjecture. In particular, our results cover the most known\nresults. In order to fully solve the conjecture, we also consider the weight of\n$\\sigma_{n, 2^t+2^s}$ and give some experiment results on it.","authors":["Wei Su","Xiaohu Tang","Alexander Pott"],"meta":["March 2012IEEE Transactions on Information Theory 59(1)","DOI:10.1109/TIT.2012.2215576","SourcearXiv"],"references":["239921608_On_a_conjecture_for_balanced_symmetric_Boolean_functions","228720083_Boolean_Functions_for_Cryptography_and_Error_Correcting_Codes","3086750_Balanced_Symmetric_Functions_Over_hboxGFp","3085505_Symmetric_Boolean_Functions","285105779_Boolean_Models_and_Methods_in_Mathematics_Computer_Science_and_Engineering","234301111_A_Table_of_Series_and_Products","222592149_K-th_order_symmetric_SAC_boolean_functions_and_bisecting_binomial_coefficients","221540831_On_the_Algebraic_Immunity_of_Symmetric_Boolean_Functions","220680333_The_Degree_of_Balanced_Elementary_Symmetric_Boolean_Functions_of_bf_4kbf_3_Variables","220296928_On_the_Bent_Boolean_Functions_That_are_Symmetric","48194964_Linear_Recurrences_and_Asymptotic_Behavior_of_Exponential_Sums_of_Symmetric_Boolean_Functions","3628856_Software_Reliability_Availability_and_Maintainability_Engineering_System_SOFT-RAMES","3085145_On_the_Degree_Nonlinearity_Algebraic_Thickness_and_Nonnormality_of_Boolean_Functions_With_Developments_on_Symmetric_Functions","3080777_Maximum_nonlinearity_of_symmetric_Boolean_functions_on_odd_number_of_variables"]}
