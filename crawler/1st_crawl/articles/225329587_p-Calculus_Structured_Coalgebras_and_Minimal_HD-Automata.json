{"id":"225329587_p-Calculus_Structured_Coalgebras_and_Minimal_HD-Automata","abstract":"The coalgebraic framework developed for the classical process algebras, and in particular its advantages concerning minimal realizations, does not fully apply to the π-calculus, due to the constraints on the freshly generated names that appear in the bisimulation.\n\nIn this paper we propose to model the transition system of the π-calculus as a coalgebra on a category of name permutation algebras and to define its abstract semantics as the final coalgebra of such a category. We show that permutations are sufficient to represent in an explicit way fresh name generation, thus allowing for the definition of minimal realizations.\n\nWe also link the coalgebraic semantics with a slightly improved version of history dependent (HD) automata, a model developed for verification purposes, where states have local names and transitions are decorated with names and name relations. HD-automata associated with agents with a bounded number of threads in their derivatives are finite and can be actually minimized. We show that the bisimulation relation in the coalgebraic context corresponds to the minimal HD-automaton.","authors":["Ugo Montanari","Marco Pistore"],"meta":["January 2000","DOI:10.1007/3-540-44612-5_52","Sourcedx.doi.org","Conference: Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science 2000, 25th International Symposium, MFCS 2000, Bratislava, Slovakia, August 28 - September 1, 2000, Proceedings"],"references":["223760020_From_SOS_Specifications_to_Structured_Coalgebras_How_to_Make_Bisimulation_a_Congruence","221236505_Final_semantics_for_the_pi-calculus","220370396_Compositional_Constructor_Interpretation_over_Coalgebraic_Models_for_the_p-Calculus","220366792_An_Introduction_to_History_Dependent_Automata","2499190_Final_Semantics_for_the_pi-calculus","261042292_Fully-abstract_model_for_the_p-calculus","242433288_M_Vento_Dipartimento_di_Informatica","222840479_Universal_coalgebra_A_theory_of_systems","221403551_Verifying_Mobile_Processes_in_the_HAL_Environment","220852378_An_Automated_Based_Verification_Environment_for_Mobile_Processes","220368619_Structured_Transition_Systems_as_Lax_Coalgebras","220248383_A_Calculus_of_Mobile_Processes_I","220247575_A_Calculus_of_Mobile_Processes_II","3677465_A_fully_abstract_domain_model_for_the_p-calculus"]}
