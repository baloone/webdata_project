{"id":"288217932_Contribution_of_weather_radar_data_to_hydropower_generation_optimization_for_the_Rhone_River_France","abstract":"CNR operates 19 hydropower plants all along the Rhone River in France. To forecast hydropower generation and to ensure the security of people and plants, CNR has developed hydrometeorological forecasting tools, rainfall-runoff modelling and propagation models, for the Rhone River and some of its main tributaries. With the assistance of Alicime, CNR achieved an application named AEGIR to integrate radar QPE into its hydrometeorological forecasting process. AEGlR allows CNR: to assess spatial rainfall pattern and rainfall variability in time and space over the Rhone River basin; to compare radar QPE and observed raingauge measurements; to forecast rainfall hyetograph for each sub-basin of the Rhone River. The paper focuses on the contribution of radar QPE regarding CNR's purposes, by analysing the quality of observed and forecasted radar quantitative estimates over the Rhone River basin, and finally assessing the operational use of radar QPE as an input into pre-existent rainfall-runoff models.","authors":["B.
