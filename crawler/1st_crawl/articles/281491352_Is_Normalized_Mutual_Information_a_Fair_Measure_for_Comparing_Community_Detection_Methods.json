{"id":"281491352_Is_Normalized_Mutual_Information_a_Fair_Measure_for_Comparing_Community_Detection_Methods","abstract":"Normalized mutual information (NMI) is a widely\nused measure to compare community detection methods. Recently,\nhowever, the need of adjustment for information theoretic\nbased measures has been argued because of their tendency in\nchoosing clustering solutions with more communities. In this\npaper an experimental evaluation of these measures is performed\nto deeply investigate this problem, and an adjustment that\nscales the values of these measures is proposed. Experiments\non synthetic generated networks, and a comparison among some\nwell know community detection methods highlight the more fair\nbehavior of scaled NMI, particularly when the network topology\ndoes not present a clear community structure.","authors":["Alessia Amelio","Clara Pizzuti"],"meta":["August 2015","DOI:10.1145/2808797.2809344","Conference: IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and MiningAt: Paris, France"],"references":["258818063_Generalized_Measures_for_the_Evaluation_of_Community_Detection_Methods","258168493_Communities_validity_methodical_evaluation_of_community_mining_algorithms","254863003_Towards_realistic_artificial_benchmark_for_community_detection_algorithms_evaluation","237283836_Information-Theoretic_Measures_for_Knowledge_Discovery_and_Data_Mining","227716904_Comparative_Evaluation_of_Community_Detection_Algorithms_A_Topological_Approach","224921429_Qualitative_Comparison_of_Community_Detection_Algorithms","221346510_Information_theoretic_measures_for_clusterings_comparison_Is_a_correction_for_chance_necessary","221273606_The_Effect_of_Network_Realism_on_Community_Detection_Algorithms","220320632_Information_Theoretic_Measures_for_Clusterings_Comparison_Variants_Properties_Normalization_and_Correction_for_Chance","220320167_Cluster_Ensembles_-_A_Knowledge_Reuse_Framework_for_Combining_Multiple_Partitions","2500099_On_Clustering_Validation_Techniques","1880802_Comparing_community_structure_identification","319206722_Solid_State_and_Quantum_Theory_for_Optoelectronics","308161218_Introduction_to_information_retrieval_chapt","288386766_Standardized_mutual_information_for_clustering_comparisons_One_step_further_in_adjustment_for_chance","285756216_An_experimental_comparison_of_model-based_clustering_methods","269339220_Generalization_of_Clustering_Agreements_and_Distances_for_Overlapping_Clusters_and_Network_Communities","253253918_Detecting_Community_Structure_in_Networks","227992567_Elements_of_Information_Theory","225069657_Defining_and_Evaluating_Network_Communities_Based_on_Ground-Truth","45854744_Community_Detection_in_Graphs","43020118_Community_Detection_Algorithms_A_Comparative_Analysis","24056046_Comparing_Partitions","23644963_Comparing_Clusterings_-_An_Information_Based_Distance","23464007_Benchmark_graphs_for_testing_community_detection_algorithms","6375717_An_Information-Theoretic_Framework_for_Resolving_Community_Structure_in_Complex_Networks","5635994_Maps_of_Random_Walks_on_Complex_Networks_Reveal_Community_Structure","3115509_Entropy_and_Correlation_Some_Comments"]}
