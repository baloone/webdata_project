{"id":"301818899_Unprovability_of_circuit_upper_bounds_in_Cook's_theory_PV","abstract":"We establish unconditionally that for every integer $k \\geq 1$ there is a language $L \\in \\mbox{P}$ such that it is consistent with Cook's theory PV that $L \\notin Size(n^k)$. Our argument is non-constructive and does not provide an explicit description of this language.","authors":["Jan Krajicek","Igor C.
