{"id":"337859098_Why_Undergraduates_Leave_STEM_Majors_Changes_Over_the_Last_Two_Decades","abstract":"Our primary aim in revisiting Talking about Leaving (TAL) was to determine whether our sample of students in STEM majors at the same schools as the original study were prompted to switch from STEM majors by the same concerns as those identified in the 1990s. This chapter describes our overall findings in answer to this question. We compare and contrast the findings of both studies, noting what has changed: what has got better or worse, what new issues have arisen, and how the patterns of concerns relevant to the persistence of women and students of color compare with those expressed two decades ago.","authors":["Anne-Barrie Hunter"],"meta":["December 2019","DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-25304-2_3","In book: Talking about Leaving Revisited (pp.87-114)"],"references":["239540385_Talking_about_Leaving_Why_Undergraduates_Leave_the_Sciences"]}
