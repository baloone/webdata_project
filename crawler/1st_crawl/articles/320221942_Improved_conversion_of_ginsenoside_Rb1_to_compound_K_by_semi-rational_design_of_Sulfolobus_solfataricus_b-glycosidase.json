{"id":"320221942_Improved_conversion_of_ginsenoside_Rb1_to_compound_K_by_semi-rational_design_of_Sulfolobus_solfataricus_b-glycosidase","abstract":"Ginsenoside compound K has been used as a key nutritional and cosmetic component because of its anti-fatigue and skin anti-aging effects. β-Glycosidase from Sulfolobus solfataricus (SS-BGL) is known as the most efficient enzyme for compound K production. The hydrolytic pathway from ginsenoside Rb1 to compound K via Rd and F2 is the most important because Rb1 is the most abundant component in ginseng extract. However, the enzymatic conversion of ginsenoside Rd to F2 is a limiting step in the hydrolytic pathway because of the relatively low activity for Rd. A V209 residue obtained from error-prone PCR was related to Rd-hydrolyzing activity, and a docking pose showing an interaction with Val209 was selected from numerous docking poses. W361F was obtained by rational design using the docking pose that exhibited 4.2-fold higher activity, 3.7-fold higher catalytic efficiency, and 3.1-fold lower binding energy for Rd than the wild-type enzyme, indicating that W361F compensated for the limiting step. W361F completely converted Rb1 to compound K with a productivity of 843 mg l⁻¹ h⁻¹ in 80 min, and showed also 7.4-fold higher activity for the flavanone, hesperidin, than the wild-type enzyme. Therefore, the W361F variant SS-BGL can be useful for hydrolysis of other glycosides as well as compound K production from Rb1, and semi-rational design is a useful tool for enhancing hydrolytic activity of β-glycosidase.\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13568-017-0487-x) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.","authors":["Kyung-Chul Shin","Hye-Yeon Choi","Min-Ju Seo","Deok-Kun Oh"],"meta":["October 2017AMB Express 7(1):186","DOI:10.1186/s13568-017-0487-x"],"references":["288658955_Compound_K_Production_from_Red_Ginseng_Extract_by_b-Glycosidase_from_Sulfolobus_solfataricus_Supplemented_with_a-L-Arabinofuranosidase_from_Caldicellulosiruptor_saccharolyticus","273155918_20-O-b-D-glucopyranosyl-20S-protopanaxadiol_a_metabolite_of_ginsenoside_Rb1_enhances_the_production_of_hyaluronic_acid_through_the_activation_of_ERK_and_Akt_mediated_by_Src_tyrosin_kinase_in_human_ker","234824344_Microbial_transformation_of_ginsenoside_Rb1_to_compound_K_by_Lactobacillus_paralimentarius","233750317_Generation_of_the_First_Structure-Based_Pharmacophore_Model_Containing_a_Selective_Zinc_Binding_Group_Feature_to_Identify_Potential_Glyoxalase-1_Inhibitors","307444652_Production_of_steviol_from_steviol_glucosides_using_b-glycosidase_from_Sulfolobus_solfataricus","262269646_20-O-b-D-glucopyranosyl-20S-protopanaxadiol_suppresses_UV-Induced_MMP-1_expression_through_AMPK-mediated_mTOR_inhibition_as_a_downstream_of_the_PKA-LKB1_pathway","260312897_Biotransformation_pathway_and_kinetics_of_the_hydrolysis_of_the_3-O-_and_20-O-multi-glucosides_of_PPD-type_ginsenosides_by_ginsenosidase_type_I","258280367_Hydrolysis_of_Flavanone_Glycosides_by_b-Glucosidase_from_Pyrococcus_furiosus_and_Its_Application_to_the_Production_of_Flavanone_Aglycones_from_Citrus_Extracts","223310007_Crystal_structure_of_the_-glycosidase_from_the_hyperthermophilic_archeon_Sulfolobus_solfataricus_resilience_as_a_key_factor_in_thermostability","222811570_Lactulose_production_from_lactose_and_fructose_by_a_thermostable_-galactosidase_from_Sulfolobus_solfataricus"]}
