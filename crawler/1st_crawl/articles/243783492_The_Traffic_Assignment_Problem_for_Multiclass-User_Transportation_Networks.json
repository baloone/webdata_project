{"id":"243783492_The_Traffic_Assignment_Problem_for_Multiclass-User_Transportation_Networks","abstract":"In a recent paper a traffic assignment model has been constructed in which the cost on a link may depend not only on its load, but also on the loads on other links of the network. In this paper it is shown that this model is also capable of handling the case of several classes of users in the same transportation network each of which has an individual cost function and, at the same time, contributes to its own and other classes' cost functions in an individual way. Typical applications arise not only in street networks where vehicles of different types share the same roads (e.g., trucks and passenger cars) but also in other types of transportation networks (e.g., telephone networks). An algorithm is constructed for finding the system-optimizing flow pattern for such a multiclass-user transportation network.","authors":["Constantine M.
