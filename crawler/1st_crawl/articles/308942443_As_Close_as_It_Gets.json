{"id":"308942443_As_Close_as_It_Gets","abstract":"We study the minimum Hamming distance between distinct satisfying assignments of a conjunctive input formula over a given set of Boolean relations (\\(\\mathsf {MinSolutionDistance}\\), \\(\\mathsf {MSD}\\)). We present a complete classification of the complexity of this optimization problem with respect to the relations admitted in the formula. We give polynomial time algorithms for several classes of constraint languages. For all other cases we prove hardness or completeness with respect to \\(\\text {poly-APX}\\), or \\(\\mathrm {NPO}\\), or equivalence to a well-known hard optimization problem.","authors":["Mike Behrisch","Miki Hermann","Stefan Mengel","Gernot Salzer"],"meta":["March 2016","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-30139-6_18","Conference: International Workshop on Algorithms and Computation"],"references":["272845725_Minimal_Distance_of_Propositional_Models","257749315_Weak_Bases_of_Boolean_Co-Clones","237654012_Playing_with_Boolean_Blocks_Part_II_Constraint_Satisfaction_Problems1","3084600_Hardness_of_Approximating_the_Minimum_Distance_of_a_Linear_Code","2279742_Closure_Properties_of_Constraints","300217992_Give_Me_Another_One","268614150_Complexity_Classifications_of_Boolean_Constraint_Satisfaction_Problems","266515478_Complexity_and_approximation_Combinatorial_optimization_problems_and_their_approximability_properties_Incl_1_CD-ROM","257650319_Complexity_and_Approximation","227227296_Polynomial_interpolation_and_the_Chinese_Remainder_Theorem_for_algebraic_systems","222813521_Bases_for_Boolean_co-clones","222283921_On_the_Hamming_distance_of_constraint_satisfaction_problems","221590732_The_Complexity_of_Satisfiability_Problems","221150594_Dichotomy_Theorem_for_the_Generalized_Unique_Satisfiability_Problem","221025984_Partial_Polymorphisms_and_Constraint_Satisfaction_Problems","220555866_SIGACT_news_complexity_theory_column_43","220430441_A_Theorem_on_Boolean_Matrices","220114576_A_Linear-Time_Algorithm_for_Testing_the_Truth_of_Certain_Quantified_Boolean_Formulas"]}
