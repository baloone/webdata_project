{"id":"261732692_Copy_number_variation_detection_using_next_generation_sequencing_read_counts","abstract":"A copy number variation (CNV) is a difference between genotypes in the number of copies of agenomic region. Next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies provide sensitive and accuratetools for detecting genomic variations that include CNVs. However, statistical approaches for CNVidentification using NGS are limited. We propose a new methodology for detecting CNVs usingNGS data. This method (henceforth denoted by m-HMM) is based on a hidden Markov modelwith emission probabilities that are governed by mixture distributions. We use the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate the parameters in the model.\nA simulation study demonstrates that our proposed m-HMMapproach has greater power for detectingcopy number gains and losses relative to existing methods. Furthermore, application of our m-HMMto DNA sequencing data from the two maize inbred lines B73 and Mo17 to identify CNVs that mayplay a role in creating phenotypic differences between these inbred lines provides results concordantwith previous array-based efforts to identify CNVs.\nThe new m-HMM method is a powerful and practical approach for identifying CNVs from NGS data.","authors":["Heng Wang","Dan Nettleton","Kai Ying"],"meta":["April 2014BMC Bioinformatics 15(1):109","DOI:10.1186/1471-2105-15-109","SourcePubMed"],"references":["259770222_Sequencing_depth_and_coverage_Key_considerations_in_genomic_analyses","257870617_Effective_normalization_for_copy_number_variation_detection_from_whole_genome_sequencing","51886896_GC-content_normalization_for_RNA-Seq_data","282821093_High-resolution_mapping_of_copy-number_alterations_with_massively_parallel_sequencing_nature","244958264_A_maximization_technique_occurring_in_the_statistical_analysis_of_probabilistic_functions_of_Markov_chains","244418125_An_inequality_with_applications_to_statistical_estimation_for_probabilistic_functions_of_a_Markov_process_and_to_a_model_for_ecology","220049445_An_Introduction_to_Hidden_Markov_Models","220049367_An_introduction_to_Hidden_Markov_Models","220049264_An_inequality_and_associated_maximization_technique_in_statistical_estimation_for_probabilistic_functions_of_Markov_processes","51564681_Comparing_Next-Generation_Sequencing_and_Microarray_Technologies_in_a_Toxicological_Study_of_the_Effects_of_Aristolochic_Acid_on_Rat_Kidneys"]}
