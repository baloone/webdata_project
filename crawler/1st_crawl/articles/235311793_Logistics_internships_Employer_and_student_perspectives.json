{"id":"235311793_Logistics_internships_Employer_and_student_perspectives","abstract":"Internships are an increasingly essential component of the educational preparation for the contemporary logistics major, and are often viewed as a “win-win” situation for both the intern and their employer(s). Despite their growing importance, there has been limited discussion of logistics internships in either the practitioner or academic literature. In an effort to address part of this literature void, reports findings from surveys of students and employers with a particular focus on their differences concerning selected internship issues. Also discusses potential implications of the findings for various logistical constituencies.","authors":["A. Michael Knemeyer","Paul R.
