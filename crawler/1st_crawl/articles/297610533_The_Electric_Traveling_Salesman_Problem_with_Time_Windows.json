{"id":"297610533_The_Electric_Traveling_Salesman_Problem_with_Time_Windows","abstract":"To minimize greenhouse gas emissions, the logistic field has seen an increasing usage of electric vehicles. The resulting distribution planning problems present new computational challenges.\nWe address a problem, called Electric Traveling Salesman Problem with Time Windows. We propose a mixed integer linear formulation that can solve 20-customer instances in short computing times and a Three-Phase Heuristic algorithm based on General Variable Neighborhood Search and Dynamic Programming.\nComputational results show that the heuristic algorithm can find the optimal solution in most small-size instances within a tenth of a second and achieves goods solutions in instances with up to 200 customers.","authors":["Roberto Roberti","Min Wen"],"meta":["May 2016Transportation Research Part E Logistics and Transportation Review 89:32-52","DOI:10.1016/j.tre.2016.01.010"],"references":["230596635_An_Optimal_Algorithm_for_the_Traveling_Salesman_Problem_with_Time_Windows","229401414_New_challenges_for_urban_consolidation_centres_A_case_study_in_The_Hague","225388312_Solving_the_Asymmetric_Travelling_Salesman_Problem_with_Time_Windows_by_branch-and-cut","220669433_A_Compressed-Annealing_Heuristic_for_the_Traveling_Salesman_Problem_with_Time_Windows","220669297_A_hybrid_exact_algorithm_for_the_TSPTW","2414509_Linear_Time_Dynamic-Programming_Algorithms_for_New_Classes_of_Restricted_TSPs_A_Computational_Study","303006562_A_time_bucket_formulation_for_the_TSP_with_time_windows","289997153_Energy-Optimized_Routing_of_Electric_Vehicles_in_Urban_Delivery_Systems","273478235_Routing_a_mixed_fleet_of_electric_and_conventional_vehicles","272568299_A_Variable_Neighborhood_Search_Branching_for_the_Electric_Vehicle_Routing_Problem_with_Time_Windows","270883447_The_Electric_Vehicle-Routing_Problem_with_Time_Windows_and_Recharging_Stations","267456483_A_variable_iterated_greedy_algorithm_for_the_traveling_salesman_problem_with_time_windows","266677862_A_heuristic_approach_for_the_green_vehicle_routing_problem_with_multiple_technologies_and_partial_recharges","257642083_An_efficient_GVNS_for_solving_Traveling_Salesman_Problem_with_Time_Windows","257551210_A_methodology_to_evaluate_the_competitiveness_of_electric_delivery_trucks","257550982_A_Green_Vehicle_Routing_Problem","242932526_Dynamic_Programming_Strategies_for_the_Traveling_Salesman_Problem_with_Time_Window_and_Precedence_Constraints","225438292_Variable_neighbourhood_search_Methods_and_applications","221704714_A_Generalized_Insertion_Heuristic_for_the_Traveling_Salesman_Problem_with_Time_Windows","220470427_Beam-ACO_for_the_travelling_salesman_problem_with_time_windows","220090403_A_General_VNS_heuristic_for_the_traveling_salesman_problem_with_time_windows"]}
