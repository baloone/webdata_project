{"id":"220068200_Precise_rendering_method_for_exact_anti-aliasing_and_highlighting","abstract":"This paper introduces the Precise Rendering Method, which generates accurately anti-aliased and highlighted images from tessellated polygons. The Precise Rendering Method first solves the aliasing problems of hidden surface removal by using the Cross Scanline Algorithm. This algorithm can exactly calculate polygon areas projected onto each pixel by using horizontal and vertical scanlines. Aliasing artifacts in shading are then prevented by the Reflection Intergration Method, which analytically integrates the intensity of reflection in the solid angle defined by surface normals at vertices of the projected area. Several synthesized images are created to show the efficiency of the Precise Rendering Method.","authors":["Toshimitsu Tanaka","Tokiichiro Takahashi"],"meta":["September 1992The Visual Computer 8(5-6):315-326","DOI:10.1007/BF01897118","SourceDBLP"],"references":["234769580_Generating_smooth_2-D_monocolor_line_drawings_on_video_displays","220184024_A_Reflectance_Model_for_Computer_Graphics","290009087_Highlighting_Rounded_Edges","269079091_Generating_smooth_2-D_monocolor_line_drawings_on_video_displays","242637008_Halftone_representation_of_3-d_objects_with_smooth_edges_by_using_a_multi-scanning_method","242373779_Illumination_for_Computer_Generated_Pictures","234810089_A_hidden-surface_algorithm_with_anti-aliasing","234792073_Model_of_Light_Reflection_for_Computer_Synthesized_Pictures","223650250_Shading_and_shadowing_with_linear_light_sources","220720484_Principles_and_Applications_of_Pencil_Tracing","30873911_Illumination_for_Computer_Generated_Pictures"]}
