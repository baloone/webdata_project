The water sampling bottles and the pipelines which touch water samples were made of plastic material without chlorine. In order to ensure the seal- ing and firmness, the whole device were tightened with nut and bolt. The inner pressure (0. 1-0. 3 MPa) in the water sampling bottle was provided by the small air pump (powered by 12 V cell) controlled by a microprogrammed control unit (MCU) and pressure sensor to keep the water flow rate (4. 0-6. 0 mL/min). The pre-conditioned SPE column can be used for the enrichment of pesticides within four weeks, and the loaded SPE column can be eluted for detection within six weeks with recoveries greater than 80%. The linearity of the method was good with the correlation coefficient more than 0. 9. The limits of quantification (LOQs) were 0. 8-6 ng/L. The recoveries of the pesticides at three spiked levels (3 parallel samples) were 86. 1% -95. 5% with the relative standard deviations less than 10%. The benzene hexachlorides (BHCs) and dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethanes (DDTs) were detected in seawater samples. The device has good application in enriching organo chlorinated and pyrethroid pesticides in seawater.","authors":["Jianglei Ye"],"meta":["September 2017Se pu = Chinese journal of chromatography / Zhongguo hua xue hui 35(9):907-911","DOI:10.3724/SP.J.1123.2017.05013"],"references":[]}
