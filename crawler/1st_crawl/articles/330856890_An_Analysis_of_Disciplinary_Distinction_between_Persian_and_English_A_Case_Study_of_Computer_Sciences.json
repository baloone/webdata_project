{"id":"330856890_An_Analysis_of_Disciplinary_Distinction_between_Persian_and_English_A_Case_Study_of_Computer_Sciences","abstract":"The study tried to discover disciplinary distinctions between Persian and English in the academic genre. The focus was on the use of metadiscourse in the discipline of computer engineering research articles across the two languages. The selected corpus was analyzed through the model suggested by Hyland and Tse (2004). The results demonstrated that the two languages are distinct in their use of metadiscourse in the discipline studied. It was found that Persian, unlike English, relied on interactive resources more. The disciplinary distinction indicates that Persian computer engineering provides more textual elements while English language values a reader responsible trend.","authors":["Reza Gholam","Gholam Reza Zarei","Sara Mansouri"],"meta":["February 2019"],"references":["285474100_Metadiscourse_in_academic_prose_A_contrastive_analysis_of_English_and_Persian_research_articles","346644499_Text_Role_and_Context_Developing_Academic_Literacies","324306533_An_Introduction_to_Functional_Grammar","310054842_Journal_abstracts_from_three_academic_fields_in_the_United_States_and_Sweden_National_or_disciplinary_proclivities","284608523_Metadiscourse_in_academic_prose_a_contrastive_study_of_academic_articles_written_in_English_by_English_and_Norwegian_speakers","248530825_Talking_to_Students_Metadiscourse_in_IntroductoryCoursebooks","247761796_Exploring_Corporate_Rhetoric_Metadiscourse_in_the_CEO's_Letter","239667929_Disciplinary_Discourses_Social_Interactions_in_Academic_Writing","235342157_Nonnative_writing_and_native_revising_of_scientific_articles","234601480_Description_du_langage_scientifique_Description_of_Scientific_Language"]}
