{"id":"265217039_Exact_and_Efficient_Construction_of_Planar_Arrangements_of_Circular_Arcs_and_Line_Segments_with_Applications_1","abstract":"We describe a simple yet powerful approach for computing planar ar-rangements of circular arcs and line segments in a robust and exact man-ner. Constructing arrangements using this approach is about one order of magnitude faster compared to other techniques that employ the exact computation paradigm. We have successfully applied our technique for computing offsets of planar polygons and for performing Boolean opera-tions on general polygons that contain circular edges.","authors":["Ron Wein","Baruch Zukerman"],"meta":[],"references":["225707399_EXACUS_Efficient_and_Exact_Algorithms_for_Curves_and_Surfaces","225679493_Classroom_Examples_of_Robustness_Problems_in_Geometric_Computations","220556508_Classroom_examples_of_robustness_problems_in_geometric_computations","47841894_EXACUS_Efficient_and_exact_algorithms_for_curves_and_surfaces","47841602_A_Computational_Basis_for_Conic_Arcs_and_Boolean_Operations_on_Conic_Polygons","29616062_Towards_an_Open_Curved_Kernel","2849293_Robust_Geometric_Computation","2304871_A_Core_Library_For_Robust_Numeric_and_Geometric_Computation","265669370_Computational_Geometry_An_Introduction","232659274_Algebraic_Methods_and_Arithmetic_Filtering_for_Exact_Predicates_on_Circle_Arcs","225573236_The_LEDA_Platform_for_Combinatorial_and_Geometric_Computing","225218545_High-Level_Filtering_for_Arrangements_of_Conic_Arcs","222680000_Interval_Arithmetic_Yields_Efficient_Dynamic_Filters_for_Computational_Geometry","220770326_Code_Flexibility_and_Program_Efficiency_by_Genericity_Improving_Cgal_'s_Arrangements","47842955_Robustness_and_Precision_Issues_in_Geometric_Computation","47841893_Wolpert_An_Exact_Complete_and_Efficient_Implementation_for_Computing_Planar_Maps_of_Quadric_Intersection_Curves","47841768_Complete_Exact_and_Efficient_Computations_with_Cubic_Curves","46620331_Computational_Geometry_Algorithms_and_Applications"]}
