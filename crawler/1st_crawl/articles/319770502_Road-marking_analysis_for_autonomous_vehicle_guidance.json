{"id":"319770502_Road-marking_analysis_for_autonomous_vehicle_guidance","abstract":"Driving an automobile autonomously on rural roads requires knowledge about the geometry of the road. Furthermore, knowledge about the meaning of each lane of the road is needed in order to decide which lane should be taken and if the vehicle can do a lane change. This paper addresses the problem of extracting additional information about lanes. The information is extracted from the types of road-markings. The type of lane border markings is estimated in order to find out if a lane change is allowed. Arrows, which are painted on the road, are extracted and classified in order to determine the meaning of a lane such as a turn off lane.","authors":["Stefan Vacek","Constantin Schimmel","RÃ¼diger Dillmann"],"meta":["January 2007"],"references":[]}
