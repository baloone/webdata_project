{"id":"338014147_System_Model_for_Prediction_Analytics_Using_K-Nearest_Neighbors_Algorithm","abstract":"Machine Learning is a growing area in computer science in todayâ€™s era. This article is focusing on prediction analysis using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Machine Learning algorithm. Data in the dataset are processed, analyzed and predicated using the specified algorithm. Introduction of various Machine Learning algorithms, its pros and cons have been discussed. The KNN algorithm with detail study is given and it is implemented on the specified data with certain parameters. The research work elucidates prediction analysis and explicates the prediction of quality of restaurants.","authors":["Devendra Prasad","Sandip Kumar Goyal","Avinash Sharma","Dr. Amit Kumar Bindal"],"meta":["October 2019Journal of Computational and Theoretical Nanoscience 16(10):4425-4430","DOI:10.1166/jctn.2019.8536"],"references":["335142506_A_Comparative_Analysis_of_Nonlinear_Machine_Learning_Algorithms_for_Breast_Cancer_Detection","333526387_Web_Mining_and_Minimization_Framework_Design_on_Sentimental_Analysis_for_Social_Tweets_Using_Machine_Learning","262937142_KNN_based_Machine_Learning_Approach_for_Text_and_Document_Mining","319770397_Bayesian_Reasoning_and_Machine_Learning","280940018_Pattern_Recognition_and_Machine_Learning","254060975_Machine_Learning_in_Financial_Crisis_Prediction_A_Survey","235890128_Machine_Learning_A_Probabilistic_Perspective","229009111_Icl_at_ntcir-7_An_improved_knn_algorithm_for_text_categorization","228343547_iDistance_An_Adaptive_B-tree_Based_Indexing_Method_for_Nearest_Neighbor_Search","222925491_Frog_classification_using_machine_learning_techniques"]}
