{"id":"2690679_SHORTEN_Simple_lossless_and_near-lossless_waveform_compression","abstract":"This report describes a program that performs compression of waveform files such as audio data. A simple predictive model of the waveform is used followed by Huffman coding of the prediction residuals. This is both fast and near optimal for many commonly occuring waveform signals. This framework is then extended to lossy coding under the conditions of maximising the segmental signal to noise ratio on a per frame basis and coding to a fixed acceptable signal to noise ratio. 1 Introduction It is common to store digitised waveforms on computers and the resulting files can often consume significant amounts of storage space. General compression algorithms do not perform very well on these files as they fail to take into account the structure of the data and the nature of the signal contained therein. Typically a waveform file will consist of signed 16 bit numbers and there will be significant sample to sample correlation. A compression utility for these file must be reasonably fast, portab...","authors":["Tony Robinson"],"meta":["February 1997"],"references":["245928042_Digital_coding_of_speech_waveforms","232620711_The_development_of_file_formats_for_very_large_speech_corpora_SPHERE_and_SHORTEN","200806186_Digital_Coding_of_Waveforms_--_Principles_and_Applications_to_Speech_and_Video","24382898_Some_practical_universal_noiseless_coding_techniques_part_2","24301300_On_the_optimality_of_code_options_for_a_universal_noiseless_coder","4696426_Adaptive_Variable-Length_Coding_for_Efficient_Compression_of_Spacecraft_Television_Data"]}
