{"id":"275669480_Average-Case_Complexity_Versus_Approximate_Simulation_of_Commuting_Quantum_Computations","abstract":"We use the class of commuting quantum computations known as IQP\n(Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial time) to strengthen the conjecture that\nquantum computers are hard to simulate classically. We show that, if either of\ntwo plausible average-case hardness conjectures holds, then IQP computations\nare hard to simulate classically up to constant additive error. One conjecture\nrelates to the hardness of estimating the complex-temperature partition\nfunction for random instances of the Ising model; the other concerns\napproximating the number of zeroes of random low-degree polynomials. We observe\nthat both conjectures can be shown to be valid in the setting of worst-case\ncomplexity. We arrive at these conjectures by deriving spin-based\ngeneralisations of the Boson Sampling problem that avoid the so-called\npermanent anticoncentration conjecture.","authors":["Michael J.
