{"id":"259513676_Parsing_by_matrix_multiplication_generalized_to_Boolean_grammars","abstract":"The well-known parsing algorithm for context-free grammars due to Valiant (1975) [25] is analyzed and extended to handle the more general Boolean grammars, which are context-free grammars augmented with conjunction and negation operators in the rules. The algorithm reduces construction of a parsing table to computing multiple products of Boolean matrices of various sizes. Its time complexity on an input string of length n is O(BMM(n)logn), where BMM(n)BMM(n) is the number of operations needed to multiply two Boolean matrices of size n×nn×n, which is O(nω)O(nω) with ω<2.373ω<2.373 as per the current knowledge. A parse tree can be constructed in time MM(n)logO(1)n (where MM(n)MM(n) is the complexity of multiplying two integer matrices), by applying a known efficient procedure for determining witnesses for Boolean matrix multiplication. The algorithm has a succinct proof of correctness and is ready to be implemented.","authors":["Alexander Okhotin"],"meta":["January 2014Theoretical Computer Science 516:101–120","DOI:10.1016/j.tcs.2013.09.011"],"references":["227045352_Complexity_of_Equations_over_Sets_of_Natural_Numbers","225147842_Conjunctive_Grammars_over_a_Unary_Alphabet_Undecidability_and_Unbounded_Growth","225138560_Conjunctive_Grammars_over_a_Unary_Alphabet_Undecidability_and_Unbounded_Growth","220779373_Matrix-vector_multiplication_in_sub-quadratic_time_some_preprocessing_required","220520582_Conjunctive_Grammars","263885584_BOOLEAN_FUZZY_SETS","263621583_GENERALIZED_LR_PARSING_ALGORITHM_FOR_BOOLEAN_GRAMMARS","262289301_Multiplying_matrices_faster_than_Coppersmith-Winograd","259163282_Conjunctive_and_Boolean_grammars_The_true_general_case_of_the_context-free_grammars","257145087_Parsing_Boolean_grammars_over_a_one-letter_alphabet_using_online_convolution","247004160_On_economical_construction_of_the_transitive_closure_of_an_oriented_graph","242361757_Introduction_to_Formal_Language_Theory","234782108_Tree-adjoining_grammar_parsing_and_Boolean_matrix_multiplication","227152010_Well-Founded_Semantics_for_Boolean_Grammars","227150482_Gaussian_elimination_is_not_optimal","226459007_Derandomization_Witnesses_for_Boolean_Matrix_Multiplication_and_Construction_of_Perfect_Hash_Functions","226171079_Fast_Parsing_for_Boolean_Grammars_A_Generalization_of_Valiant's_Algorithm","223669540_Membership_problems_for_regular_and_context-free_trace_languages","222796853_General_Context-Free_Recognition_in_Less_than_Cubic_Time","222420570_Unambiguous_Boolean_grammars","222386847_Boolean_grammars","221591803_Matrix_Multiplication_via_Arithmetic_Progressions","221259142_Fast_Stochastic_Context-Free_Parsing_A_Stochastic_Version_of_the_Valiant_Algorithm","220574291_TAL_Recognition_in_OMn_Time","220248248_Well-founded_semantics_for_Boolean_grammars","220198431_Recursive_descent_parsing_for_Boolean_grammars","220197972_Improved_Time_and_Space_Bounds_for_Boolean_Matrix_Multiplication","2839766_Fast_Context-Free_Grammar_Parsing_Requires_Fast_Boolean_Matrix_Multiplication","2481575_TAL_Recognition_in_OMn2_Time","2480349_Tree-Adjoining_Grammar_Parsing_and_Boolean_Matrix_Multiplication","2279509_Context-free_recognition_via_shortest_paths_computation_a_version_of_Valiant's_algorithm"]}
