{"id":"305036203_On_the_Power_of_Conditional_Samples_in_Distribution_Testing","abstract":"In this paper we define and examine the power of the conditional-sampling oracle in the context of distribution-property testing. The conditional-sampling oracle for a discrete distribution $\\mu$ takes as input a subset $S \\subset [n]$ of the domain, and outputs a random sample $i \\in S$ drawn according to $\\mu$, conditioned on $S$ (and independently of all prior samples). The conditional-sampling oracle is a natural generalization of the ordinary sampling oracle, in which $S$ always equals $[n]$. We show that with the conditional-sampling oracle, testing uniformity, testing identity to a known distribution, and testing any label-invariant property of distributions is easier than with the ordinary sampling oracle. On the other hand, we also show that for some distribution properties the sample-complexity remains near-maximal even with conditional sampling.","authors":["Sourav Chakraborty","Eldar Fischer","Yonatan Goldhirsh","Arie Matsliah"],"meta":["January 2016SIAM Journal on Computing 45(4):1261-1296","DOI:10.1137/140964199"],"references":["3087077_A_Coincidence-Based_Test_for_Uniformity_Given_Very_Sparsely_Sampled_Discrete_Data"]}
