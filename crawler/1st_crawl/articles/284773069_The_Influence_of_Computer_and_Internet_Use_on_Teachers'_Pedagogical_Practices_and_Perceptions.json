{"id":"284773069_The_Influence_of_Computer_and_Internet_Use_on_Teachers'_Pedagogical_Practices_and_Perceptions","abstract":"This study explores the possibility that in schools where an informational and social support network is available and where a sufficient technological infrastructure is in place, computer use may be a powerful catalyst leading to more constructivist practices on the part of teachers. Survey research at 153 schools of the National School Network provides evidence that under these favorable circumstances, teachers’ sustained use of computers and exploration of Internet resources is related to their increased use of constructivist teaching practices and may even change teachers’ pedagogical beliefs that underlie such practices. The relationship between computer use and pedagogical change is particularly strong among secondary teachers in social studies, science, and noncore subjects. This article discusses three alternative theories to account for the observed correlations.","authors":["Henry Jay Becker","Jason Ravitz"],"meta":["June 1999Journal of Research on Computing in Education 31(4):356-384","DOI:10.1080/08886504.1999.10782260","Project: (Tech) Technology Use Related to Teaching and Learning Reforms"],"references":["245753708_Computers_as_Mindtools_for_engaging_learners_in_critical_thinking","229067961_The_Origins_of_Intelligence_In_Children","220425768_Internetworking_Coordinating_Technology_for_Systemic_Reform","49176543_Situated_Cognition_and_Culture_of_Learning"]}
