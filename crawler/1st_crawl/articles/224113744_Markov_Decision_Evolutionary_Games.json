{"id":"224113744_Markov_Decision_Evolutionary_Games","abstract":"We present a class of evolutionary games involving large populations that have many pairwise interactions between randomly selected players. The fitness of a player depends not only on the actions chosen in the interaction but also on the individual state of the players. Players have a finite life time during which they participate in several local interactions and take actions. The actions taken by a player determine not only the immediate fitness but also the transition probabilities to its next individual state. We define and characterize the Evolutionary Stable Strategies for these games and propose a method to compute them. We illustrate the model and results through a networking problem.","authors":["Eitan Altman","Yezekael Hayel"],"meta":["August 2010IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control 55(7):1560 - 1569","DOI:10.1109/TAC.2010.2042230","SourceIEEE Xplore"],"references":["269697756_Robust_permanence_and_impermanence_for_stochastic_replicator_dynamics","265549510_A_Matrix_Game_Solution_of_the_Single-Controller_Stochastic_Game","264046454_Linear_programming_and_finite_Markovian_control_problems","230652668_Robust_permanence_and_impermanence_for_stochastic_replicator_dynamics","225820721_Sensitivity_of_constrained_Markov_decision_processes","312982657_Stochastic_games","305975791_The_Hawk-Dove_game_as_an_average-cost_problem","268611768_The_Hawk-Dove_Game_as_an_Average-Cost_Problem","262212542_Splitting_Randomized_Stationary_Policies_in_Total-Reward_Markov_Decision_Processes","251171577_A_Stochastic_Evolutionary_Game_Approach_to_Energy_Management_in_a_Distributed_Aloha_Network","249282494_Evolutionarily_stable_strategies_in_the_repeated_hawk-dove_game","246285705_Game_Theory_and_the_Evolution_of_Fighting","243970871_Evolutionary_Games_and_Population_Dynamics","226908857_Fighting_for_food_a_dynamic_version_of_the_Hawk-Dove_game","224311515_A_Stochastic_Evolutionary_Game_of_Energy_Management_in_a_Distributed_Aloha_Network","222483591_Stochastic_Evolutionary_Game_Theory","222370467_Markov_decision_processes","222298043_Continuous_Approximations_of_Stochastic_Evolutionary_Game_Dynamics","29619104_Asymptotic_properties_of_constrained_Markov_Decision_Processes","23573726_Evolutionary_Game_Theory","7191525_Stochastic_Games","2620771_Constrained_Markov_Decision_Processes","2118653_The_long-run_behavior_of_the_stochastic_replicator_dynamics"]}
