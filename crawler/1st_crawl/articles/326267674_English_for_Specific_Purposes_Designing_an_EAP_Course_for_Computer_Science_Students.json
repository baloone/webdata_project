{"id":"326267674_English_for_Specific_Purposes_Designing_an_EAP_Course_for_Computer_Science_Students","abstract":"p> The aim of this study was to design English for Academic Purposes (EAP) course for University students enrolled in the Computer Science Department. For this purpose, academic English language needs of the students were analyzed by using a 5 point Likert scale questionnaire. Additionally, interviews were also conducted with four faculty members of the department and the data were analyzed qualitatively. Thus, mixed methods were used for collection and analyses of data. The results of the analysis of questionnaire and interviews indicate that the four language skills, namely listening, speaking, reading and writing are frequently used in studentsâ€™ academic context and among the four, speaking is the most frequently used skill. Students are deficient in writing and speaking skills as compared to listening and reading; therefore, speaking and writing should be given preference while designing the syllabus. </p","authors":["Isra Irshad","Behzad Anwar"],"meta":["May 2018Journal of Education and Educational Development 5(1):156","DOI:10.22555/joeed.v5i1.1533"],"references":["291972483_Issues_in_EAP_A_preliminary_perspective","284192737_English_for_specific_purposes_ESP_Its_history_and_contributions","271104588_The_Elements_of_Language_Curriculum_A_Systematic_Approach_to_Program_Development","269854502_English_for_Academic_Purposes_A_Guide_and_Resource_Book_for_Teachers","232014774_Needs_analysis_in_language_teaching","49550079_Communicative_Syllabus_Design","29741332_Japanese_language_needs_analysis_1998-1999"]}
