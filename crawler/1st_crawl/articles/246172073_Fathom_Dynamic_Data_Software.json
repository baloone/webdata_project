{"id":"246172073_Fathom_Dynamic_Data_Software","abstract":"Fathom is dynamic software that’s fun and effective for teaching data analysis and statistics. It’s also a powerful tool for high school students to use for modeling with mathematics, as required by the Common Core State Standards. In addition to helping students understand algebra, precalculus and statistics, Fathom’s powerful data analysis capabilities make it an excellent tool for the physical and biological sciences, as well as for social science courses.","authors":["William Finzer","Tim Erickson","J.
