{"id":"222422173_Uniform_test_of_algorithmic_randomness_over_a_general_space","abstract":"The algorithmic theory of randomness is well developed when the underlying space is the set of finite or infinite sequences and the underlying probability distribution is the uniform distribution or a computable distribution. These restrictions seem artificial. Some progress has been made to extend the theory to arbitrary Bernoulli distributions (by Martin-Löf) and to arbitrary distributions (by Levin). We recall the main ideas and problems of Levin's theory, and report further progress in the same framework. The issues are the following:•Allow non-compact spaces (like the space of continuous functions, underlying the Brownian motion).•The uniform test (deficiency of randomness) dP(x) (depending both on the outcome x and the measure P) should be defined in a general and natural way.•See which of the old results survive: existence of universal tests, conservation of randomness, expression of tests in terms of description complexity, existence of a universal measure, expression of mutual information as “deficiency of independence”.•The negative of the new randomness test is shown to be a generalization of complexity in continuous spaces; we show that the addition theorem survives.The paper's main contribution is introducing an appropriate framework for studying these questions and related ones (like statistics for a general family of distributions).","authors":["Peter Gacs"],"meta":["September 2005Theoretical Computer Science 341(1-3):91-137","DOI:10.1016/j.tcs.2005.03.054","SourcearXiv","Project: Algorithmic information theory"],"references":["319393405_An_Introduction_to_Kolmogorov_Complexity_and_Its_Applications","284090758_On_the_symmetry_of_algorithmic_information","329476835_On_the_Empirical_Validity_of_the_Bayesian_Method","287257452_The_complexity_of_finite_objects_and_the_basing_of_the_concepts_of_information_and_randomness_on_the_theory_of_algorithms","275981329_Convergence_of_Probability_Measures","268255110_A_User's_Guide_to_Measure_Theoretic_Probability","267189730_Uniform_tests_of_randomness","267048851_Topology_and_measure","265820169_Randomness_spaces_extended_abstract","256554744_On_the_relation_between_descriptional_complexity_and_algorithmic_probability"]}
