{"id":"318652477_Twelve_years_before_the_quantum_no-cloning_theorem","abstract":"The celebrated quantum no-cloning theorem establishes the impossibility of making a perfect copy of an unknown quantum state. The discovery of this important theorem for the field of quantum information is currently dated 1982. I show here that an article published in 1970 [J. L. Park, Found. Phys. 1, 23â€“33 (1970)] contained an explicit mathematical proof of the impossibility of cloning quantum states. I analyze Park's demonstration in the light of published explanations concerning the genesis of the better-known papers on no-cloning.","authors":["Juan Ortigoso"],"meta":["July 2017American Journal of Physics 86(3)","DOI:10.1119/1.5021356"],"references":["317630056_Light_for_the_quantum_Entangled_photons_and_their_applications_A_very_personal_perspective","13237765_Teleporting_an_unknown_quantum_state_via_dual_classical_and_Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen_channels","253158006_What's_Wrong_with_this_Pillow","249080154_Quantum_Theoretical_Concepts_of_Measurement_Part_II","247175949_Photons_cannot_always_be_replicated","245601492_Can_quantum_mechancial_description_of_physics_be_considered_complete","236510025_Quantum_Information_and_Computation","234782642_Conjugate_Coding","229747563_How_the_no-cloning_theorem_got_its_name","228109669_A_Single_Quantum_Cannot_be_Cloned","228109505_Experimental_quantum_teleportation","227105657_FLASH-A_superluminal_communicator_based_upon_a_new_kind_of_quantum_measurement","226928756_The_concept_of_transition_in_quantum_mechanics","226666657_Neumark's_theorem_and_quantum_inseparability","226388817_Simultaneous_measurability_in_quantum_theory","222459031_Communication_by_EPR_devices","221580924_Quantum_Copy-Protection_and_Quantum_Money","220681472_Quantum_Information_Theory","200703048_Can_Quantum-Mechanical_Description_of_Physical_Reality_Be_Considered_Complete","13374806_Quantum_Copying_Beyond_the_No-Cloning_Theorem","2196917_Quantum_cloning"]}
