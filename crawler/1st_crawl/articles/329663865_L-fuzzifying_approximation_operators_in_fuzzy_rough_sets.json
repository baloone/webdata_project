{"id":"329663865_L-fuzzifying_approximation_operators_in_fuzzy_rough_sets","abstract":"In rough set theory, lower and upper approximation operators are two primitive notions. Various fuzzy generalizations of lower and upper approximation operators have been introduced over the years. Considering L being a completely distributive De Morgan algebra, this paper mainly proposes a general framework of L-fuzzifying approximation operators in which constructive and axiomatic approaches are used. In the constructive approach, a pair of lower and upper L-fuzzifying approximation operators is defined. The connections between L-fuzzy relations and L-fuzzifying approximation operators are examined. In the axiomatic approach, various types of L-fuzzifying rough sets are proposed and L-fuzzifying approximation operators corresponding to each type of L-fuzzy relations as well as their compositions are characterized by single axioms. Moreover, the relationships between L-fuzzifying rough sets and L-fuzzifying topological spaces are investigated. It is shown that there is a one-to-one correspondence between reflexive and transitive L-fuzzifying approximation spaces and saturated L-fuzzifying topological spaces.","authors":["Bin Pang","Ju-Sheng Mi","Zhen-Yu Xiu"],"meta":["December 2018Information Sciences 480(1)","DOI:10.1016/j.ins.2018.12.021"],"references":["324598495_Base_axioms_and_Subbase_axioms_in_M-fuzzifying_convex_spaces","323113264_Degrees_of_separation_properties_in_stratified_L-generalized_convergence_spaces_using_residual_implication","320023003_On_the_measure_of_M-rough_approximation_of_L-fuzzy_sets","318197425_Stratified_L_-ordered_filter_spaces","318018481_Using_single_axioms_to_characterize_S_T-intuitionistic_fuzzy_rough_approximation_operators","317869738_M-fuzzifying_cotopological_spaces_and_M-fuzzifying_convex_spaces_as_M-fuzzifying_closure_spaces","287356915_Using_One_Axiom_to_Characterize_Fuzzy_Rough_Approximation_Operators_Determined_by_a_Fuzzy_Implication_Operator","233988474_Topological_and_lattice_structures_of_L-fuzzy_rough_sets_determined_by_lower_and_upper_sets","223281901_Axiomatics_for_fuzzy_rough_sets","223037285_Generalized_fuzzy_rough_sets_determined_by_a_triangular_norm","327128690_Metric-based_L_-fuzzy_rough_sets_Approximation_operators_and_definable_sets","318688967_Using_one_axiom_to_characterize_L_-fuzzy_rough_approximation_operators_based_on_residuated_lattices","316873888_Single_axioms_for_lower_fuzzy_rough_approximation_operators_determined_by_fuzzy_implications","308170035_Characterizations_of_L-convex_spaces","288219287_M-valued_Measure_of_Roughness_for_Approximation_of_L-fuzzy_Sets_and_Its_Topological_Interpretation","285042505_Axiomatic_characterizations_of_S_T-fuzzy_rough_approximation_operators","284685947_Generalized_rough_sets_models","279185217_Topological_and_Fuzzy_Rough_Sets","277382735_Fuzzy_rough_sets_based_on_generalized_residuated_lattices","267116316_On_topology_in_information_system","265349410_A_certain_conception_of_rough_sets_in_topological_Boolean_algebras","263092404_On_approximate-type_systems_generated_by_L-relations","261174867_Rough_approximation_operators_on_R0-algebras_nilpotent_minimum_algebras_with_an_application_in_formal_logic_L","259133616_Generalized_fuzzy_rough_approximation_operators_determined_by_fuzzy_implicators","256991807_Towards_the_theory_of_M-approximateM-approximate_systems_Fundamentals_and_examples","256721006_Using_one_axiom_to_characterize_rough_set_and_fuzzy_rough_set_approximations","256244374_Fuzzy_topological_space","256212231_Rough_set","247520571_Similarity_and_fuzzy_ordering","242800328_Alternative_characterizations_of_FNCS","235184984_L-fuzzy_Sets","223685500_One-to-one_correspondence_between_fuzzifying_topologies_and_fuzzy_preorders","223614829_On_characterizations_of_IT-fuzzy_rough_approximation_operators","223571886_An_axiomatic_approach_of_fuzzy_rough_sets_based_on_residuated_lattices","223446517_A_comparative_study_of_fuzzy_rough_sets","223239982_An_axiomatic_characterization_of_a_fuzzy_generalization_of_rough_sets","223123246_Upper_semicontinuous_fuzzy_sets_and_applications","222750934_On_the_topological_properties_of_fuzzy_rough_sets","222743868_Generalized_rough_sets_based_on_relations","222587671_Generalized_rough_sets_over_fuzzy_lattices","222552693_Constructive_and_axiomatic_approaches_of_fuzzy_approximation_operators","222542991_Concept_lattices_and_order_in_fuzzy_logic","222473441_Relational_Interpretations_of_Neigborhood_Operators_and_Rough_Set_Approximation_Operators","222461192_Constructive_and_Algebraic_Methods_of_the_Theory_of_Rough_Sets","222332314_A_new_approach_for_fuzzy_topology_II","222014381_Reduction_and_axiomization_of_covering_generalized_rough_sets","221996309_On_axiomatic_characterisations_of_crisp_approximation_operators","220801550_Rough_Approximate_Operators_Axiomatic_Rough_Set_Theory","220528944_The_relationship_between_L-fuzzy_rough_set_and_L-topology","220444357_The_Axiomatization_of_the_Rough_Set_Upper_Approximation_Operations","220393535_Fuzzy_Rough_Sets_Based_on_Residuated_Lattices","3897686_On_axiomatic_characterization_of_fuzzy_approximation_operators_II_The_rough_fuzzy_set_based_case","2798759_Generalization_of_Rough_Sets_using_Modal_Logics"]}
