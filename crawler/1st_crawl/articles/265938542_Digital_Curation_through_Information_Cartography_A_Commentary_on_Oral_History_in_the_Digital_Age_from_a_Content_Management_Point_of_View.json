We offer a fluid, variable model\nfor evaluating curatorial choices and options in particular situations, asserting that usually the best-practice question\nhas only one answer—it depends. We then apply our curatorial model to a broader range of digital-age issues, from transcription\nto open-source software. We suggest the limited value of, or necessity for, posing either/or choices. We argue against deferring\naction while waiting for the perfect technology to emerge. Our basic advice is: you can only steer a bicycle when you’re riding\nit, and the only way to ride it is to start pedaling.","authors":["Douglas Lambert","Michael H.
