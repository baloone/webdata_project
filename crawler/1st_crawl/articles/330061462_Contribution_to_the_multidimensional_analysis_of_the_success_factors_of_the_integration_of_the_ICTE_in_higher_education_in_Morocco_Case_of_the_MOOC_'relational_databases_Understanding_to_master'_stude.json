In this article, we assume that the integration of ICTE is justified as shown by the multidimensional analysis adopted in the treatment of informant's responses. Thus, through an observation and application analysis of the chi-square law statistical test, we aim to consider the dependency relationships between the various modalities in the questionnaires and the various ways of monitoring the MOOC. The analysis of the results of this experiment has led to four main dimensions: teacher coaching, collaboration between learners, prerequisites in the module element and the rate of MOOC follow-up. These dimensions represent the most important factors for the integration of ICTE from a student's point of view.","authors":["Bouchaib Riyami","Khalifa Mansouri","Franck Poirier"],"meta":["January 2019International Journal of Technology Enhanced Learning 11(1):80","DOI:10.1504/IJTEL.2019.096750","Project: Our publication in Volume 11, NÂ°1, 2019"],"references":["311563552_Analyse_Multidimensionnelle_Des_Facteurs_D'integration_Des_Tice_Etude_De_Cas_A_Travers_Le_Programme_Genie_Marocain","289994213_L'integration_des_TIC_dans_l'enseignement_des_SVT_au_Maroc_realite_et_attentes","272475898_Plates-formes_d'enseignement_a_distance_dans_l'enseignement_superieur_modes_d'appropriation_et_standardisation_des_usages","296935900_Effets_des_TIC_sur_les_pratiques_pedagogiques_dans_un_etablissement_d'enseignement_superieur_marocain","269949435_Impact_of_Using_Java_Software_of_Geometrical_Optics_JSGO_on_the_Construction_Success_of_the_Virtual_Image_among_the_First_Year_University_Students","266715202_Usage_des_TIC_en_pedagogie_universitaire_point_de_vue_des_etudiants"]}
