{"id":"230923003_On_the_structure_of_the_special_linear_group_over_polynomial_rings","abstract":"It is proved that the special linear group of degree not less than three over the polynomial ring over a field is generated by the elementary matrices. Other results are obtained that relate to the structure of the special linear group and stabilization of the general linear group over arbitrary polynomial and Laurent rings.\n\nBibliography: 9 titles.","authors":["A A  Suslin"],"meta":["October 2007Mathematics of the USSR-Izvestiya 11(2):221","DOI:10.1070/IM1977v011n02ABEH001709"],"references":["265350819_Introduction_to_algebraic_K-theory","248065593_The_Whitehead_group_of_a_polynomial_extension","247575992_Solution_of_the_congruence_subgroup_problem_for_SL_n_n_3_and_Sp2n_n_2","247048503_On_the_structure_of_the_GL2_of_a_ring","242959409_K_1_-theory_and_the_congruence_problem"]}
