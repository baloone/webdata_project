{"id":"357025344_Computer_Multimedia_Security_Protection_System_Based_on_the_Network_Security_Active_Defense_Model","abstract":"In response to the continuous development of computer science and multimedia technology, many problems related to computer multimedia security are gradually exposed in the development. Through the existence of hidden dangers of computer multimedia security, a computer is constructed based on the network security active defense model. For a multimedia security protection system, select four modules in the system for design and description. Finally, the experimental results show that the system designed in this study can realize the security protection of computer multimedia, and the system is simple to operate and has strong practicability and meets the expected design effect.","authors":["Yanhong Shang","Jing Zhang"],"meta":["December 2021Advances in Multimedia 2021(1):1-9","DOI:10.1155/2021/8792105"],"references":["338106920_Dual_server_based_security_system_for_multimedia_Services_in_Next_Generation_Networks","284900718_Image_Encryption_Using_Koblitz's_Encoding_and_New_Mapping_Method_Based_on_Elliptic_Curve_Random_Number_Generator","282534082_A_resource-efficient_multimedia_encryption_scheme_for_embedded_video_sensing_system_based_on_unmanned_aircraft","271713552_Securing_data_exchange_in_wireless_multimedia_sensor_networks_perspectives_and_challenges","332628125_Protection_Strategy_of_Current_Suppression_Resistor_Used_in_MMC-HVDC_Startup_Process","329929430_Dual_watermarking_framework_for_privacy_protection_and_content_authentication_of_multimedia","319326631_Oxidation_Mechanism_and_Protection_Strategy_of_Ultrathin_Indium_Selenide_Insight_From_Theory","312118719_Research_on_barrier_free_design_of_the_landscape_environment_of_the_city_walking_street_based_on_computer_multimedia_A_security_perspective","284106573_Risk_assessment_of_information_security_based_on_improved_wavelet_neural_network","277923721_Research_on_Network_Malicious_Code_Immune_Based_on_Imbalanced_Support_Vector_Machines"]}
