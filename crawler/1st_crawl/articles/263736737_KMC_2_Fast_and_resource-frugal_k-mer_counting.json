{"id":"263736737_KMC_2_Fast_and_resource-frugal_k-mer_counting","abstract":"Motivation: \nBuilding the histogram of occurrences of every k-symbol long substring of nucleotide data is a standard step in many bioinformatics applications, known under the name of k-mer counting. Its applications include developing de Bruijn graph genome assemblers, fast multiple sequence alignment and repeat detection. The tremendous amounts of NGS data require fast algorithms for k-mer counting, preferably using moderate amounts of memory.\n\nResults: \nWe present a novel method for k-mer counting, on large datasets about twice faster than the strongest competitors (Jellyfish 2, KMC 1), using about 12 GB (or less) of RAM. Our disk-based method bears some resemblance to MSPKmerCounter, yet replacing the original minimizers with signatures (a carefully selected subset of all minimizers) and using (k, x)-mers allows to significantly reduce the I/O and a highly parallel overall architecture allows to achieve unprecedented processing speeds. For example, KMC 2 counts the 28-mers of a human reads collection with 44-fold coverage (106 GB of compressed size) in about 20 min, on a 6-core Intel i7 PC with an solid-state disk.","authors":["Sebastian Deorowicz","Marek Kokot","Szymon Grabowski","Agnieszka Debudaj-Grabysz"],"meta":["July 2014Bioinformatics 31(10)","DOI:10.1093/bioinformatics/btv022","SourcearXiv"],"references":["262695062_KeeSeek_Searching_distant_non-existing_words_in_genomes_for_PCR-based_applications","260915055_KAnalyze_A_Fast_Versatile_Pipelined_K-mer_Toolkit","260443015_Wood_DE_Salzberg_SL_Kraken_Ultrafast_metagenomic_sequence_classification_using_exact_alignment_Genome_Biol_15_R46","259824884_On_the_Representation_of_De_Bruijn_Graphs","236913564_Disk-based_-mer_counting_on_a_PC","236057792_pfsearchV3_a_code_acceleration_and_heuristic_to_search_PROSITE_profiles","264318372_Implementation_and_performance_analysis_of_efficient_index_structures_for_DNA_search_algorithms_in_parallel_platforms","260717407_Turtle_Identifying_frequent_k-mers_with_cache-efficient_algorithms","234158168_DSK_K-mer_counting_with_very_low_memory_usage","226827873_Cache-_Hash-_and_Space-Efficient_Bloom_Filters"]}
