{"id":"221234915_Fast_LCF-Style_Proof_Reconstruction_for_Z3","abstract":"The Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solver Z3 can generate proofs of unsatisfiability. We present independent reconstruction\nof these proofs in the theorem provers Isabelle/HOL and HOL4 with particular focus on efficiency. Our highly optimized implementations\noutperform previous LCF-style proof checkers for SMT, often by orders of magnitude. Detailed performance data shows that LCF-style\nproof reconstruction can be faster than proof search in Z3.","authors":["Sascha BÃ¶hme","Tjark Weber"],"meta":["July 2010","DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-14052-5_14","SourceDBLP","Conference: Interactive Theorem Proving, First International Conference, ITP 2010, Edinburgh, UK, July 11-14, 2010.
