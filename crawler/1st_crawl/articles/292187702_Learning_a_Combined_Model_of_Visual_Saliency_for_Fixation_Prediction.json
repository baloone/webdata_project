{"id":"292187702_Learning_a_Combined_Model_of_Visual_Saliency_for_Fixation_Prediction","abstract":"A large number of saliency models, each based on a different hypothesis, have been proposed over the past 20 years. In practice, while subscribing to one hypothesis or computational principle makes a model that perform well on some types of images, it hinders the general performance of a model on arbitrary images and large-scale datasets. One natural approach to improve overall saliency detection accuracy would then be fusing different types of models. In this paper, inspired by the success of late-fusion strategies in semantic analysis and multimodal biometrics, we propose to fuse state-of-the-art saliency models at the score level in a para-boosting learning fashion. First, saliency maps generated by several models are used as confidence scores. Then, these scores are fed into our paraboosting learner (i.e., Support Vector Machine (SVM), Adaptive Boosting (AdBoost), or Probability Density Estimator (PDE)) to generate the final saliency map. In order to explore the strength of para-boosting learners, traditional transformation-based fusion strategies such as Sum, Min, and Max are also explored and compared in this paper. To further reduce the computation cost of fusing too many models, only a few of them are considered in the next step. Experimental results show that score-level fusion outperforms each individual model and can further reduce the performance gap between current models and the human interobserver (human IO) model.","authors":["Jingwei Wang","Ali Borji","C.-C.
