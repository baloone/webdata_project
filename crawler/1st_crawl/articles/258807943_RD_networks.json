{"id":"258807943_RD_networks","abstract":"We develop a model of strategic networks that captures two distinctive features of interfirm collaboration: bilateral agreements and nonexclusive relationships. Our analysis highlights the relationship between market competition, firms' incentives to invest in R&D, and the architecture of collaboration networks. In the absence of firm rivalry, the complete network, where each firm collaborates with all others, is uniquely stable, industry-profit maximizing, and efficient. BY contrast, under strong market rivalry the complete network is stable, but intermediate levels of collaboration and asymmetric networks are more attractive from a collective viewpoint. This suggests that competing firms may have excessive incentives to form collaborative links.","authors":["Sanjeev Goyal","Jose Luis Moraga-Gonzalez"],"meta":["December 2001The RAND Journal of Economics 32(4):686-707","DOI:10.2307/2696388"],"references":["228589195_Network_Forms_of_Organization","5222722_Choosing_Organizational_Modes_of_Strategic_Technology_Partnering","4980776_Public_Policy_Towards_RD_in_Oligopolistic_Industries","4980575_Research_Joint_Ventures_and_RD_Cartels","254400545_A_note_on_cooperative_and_noncooperative_RD_in_duopoly","245281139_An_Analysis_of_Cooperative_RD","227769070_Joint_ventures_and_competitive_strategy","227722739_Joint_Ventures_Theoretical_and_Empirical_Perspectives","222281122_Learning_Through_Alliances","24058632_Link_Formation_in_Cooperative_Situations","24048902_Endogenous_Structures_of_Association_in_Oligopolies","4977258_A_Strategic_Model_of_Social_and_Economic_Networks","4955689_Endogenous_Formation_of_Research_Coalitions_with_Spillovers","4901527_A_Theory_of_Buyer-Seller_Networks","4896392_A_Non-Cooperative_Model_of_Network_Formation"]}
