{"id":"335801073_Design_of_High-Rate_LDPC_Codes_Based_on_Matroid_Theory","abstract":"In this letter, sufficient conditions for the determination of the girth are studied from the perspective of matroid theory. The girth of a Tanner graph is at least 2(t1 + 2) if t1 specific conditions are simultaneously met. A novel method of constructing high-rate low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes is proposed based on the matroid theory. The parity-check matrices of the constructed LDPC codes are in the form of H = IjH2 with H2 constructed under the conditions of a given girth and a fixed column weight (e.g., Wc = 4 or Wc = 6). Simulation results verify that the proposed LDPC codes outperform those in the literature over additive white Gaussian noise channels in terms of bit error rate performance.","authors":["wu Guangfu","Yijie Lv","Jiguang He"],"meta":["September 2019IEEE Communications Letters PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/LCOMM.2019.2940977","Project: NFS of china"],"references":["333892876_1907VTMOutage-Limit-Approaching_Channel_Coding_for_Future_Wireless_Communications-Root-Protograph_Low-density_Parity-Check_Codes","331149514_Constructions_of_Type-II_QC-LDPC_Codes_with_Girth_Eight_from_Sidon_Sequence","312194606_On_the_Tanner_Graph_Cycle_Distribution_of_Random_LDPC_Random_Protograph-Based_LDPC_and_Random_Quasi-Cyclic_LDPC_Code_Ensembles","311585887_Graph_based_linear_error_correcting_codes","333883611_Root-Protograph-based_BICM-ID_A_Reliable_and_Efficient_Transmission_Solution_for_Block-Fading_Channels","332475931_Slow-Fading_Wireless_Communications_Outage-Limit-Approaching_Channel_Coding_for_Future_Wireless_Communications","328524500_Reed-Solomon-Based_Quasi-Cyclic_LDPC_Codes_Designs_Cycle_Structure_and_Erasure_Correction","319478289_Lower_bounds_on_the_lifting_degree_of_single-edge_and_multiple-edge_QC-LDPC_codes_by_difference_matrices","309336868_Construction_of_high-rate_QC-LDPC_codes_with_multi-weight_circulants","309144298_Symmetrical_Constructions_for_Regular_Girth-8_QC-LDPC_Codes"]}
