{"id":"331420447_Algal_Remodeling_in_a_Ubiquitous_Planktonic_Photosymbiosis","abstract":"Photosymbiosis between single-celled hosts and microalgae is common in oceanic plankton, espe- cially in oligotrophic surface waters. However, the functioning of this ecologically important cell-cell interaction and the subcellular mechanisms allowing the host to accommodate and benefit from its micro- algae remain enigmatic. Here, using a combination of quantitative single-cell structural and chemical imaging techniques (FIB-SEM, nanoSIMS, Synchro- tron X-ray fluorescence), we show that the struc- tural organization, physiology, and trophic status of the algal symbionts (the haptophyte Phaeocystis) significantly change within their acantharian hosts compared to their free-living phase in culture. In sym- biosis, algal cell division is blocked, photosynthesis is enhanced, and cell volume is increased by up to 10-fold with a higher number of plastids (from 2 to up to 30) and thylakoid membranes. The multiplica- tion of plastids can lead to a 38-fold increase of the total plastid volume in a cell. Subcellular mapping of nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorous) and their stoichiometric ratios shows that symbiotic algae are impoverished in phosphorous and suggests a higher investment in energy-acquisition machinery rather than in growth. Nanoscale imaging also showed that the host supplies a substantial amount of trace metals (e.g., iron and cobalt), which are stored in algal vacu- oles at high concentrations (up to 660 ppm). Sulfur mapping reveals a high concentration in algal vacu-\noles that may be a source of antioxidant molecules. Overall, this study unveils an unprecedented morpho- logical and metabolic transformation of microalgae following their integration into a host, and it suggests that this widespread symbiosis is a farming strategy wherein the host engulfs and exploits microalgae.","authors":["Johan Decelle","Gregory Stryganyuk","Benoit Gallet","Giulia Veronesi"],"meta":["February 2019Current biology: CB
