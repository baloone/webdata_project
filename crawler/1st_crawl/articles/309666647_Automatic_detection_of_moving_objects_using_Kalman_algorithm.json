{"id":"309666647_Automatic_detection_of_moving_objects_using_Kalman_algorithm","abstract":"Detection of objects in motion is one of the challenging task in computer science domain. Different techniques for detecting motion of objects have been applied in various fields. One of the interesting techniques is Kalman filter and its feature to estimate and predict moving object with the help of image sequence. The paper focuses on moving object detection with the help of Kalman filter algorithm. Detecting various objects in camera of surveillance system is important task of this algorithm but when complexity of occlusion becomes serious we need to extend the features of Kalman filter to decide the position of occluded objects. This paper proposes Kalman filter to know the position of moving object during motion.","authors":["V. Vijayarajan","R.
