{"id":"283777683_IGeoRec_A_Personalized_and_Efficient_Geographical_Location_Recommendation_Framework","abstract":"Geographical influence has been intensively exploited for location recommendations in location-based social networks (LBSNs) due to the fact that geographical proximity significantly affects users' check-in behaviors. However, current studies only model the geographical influence on all users' check-in behaviors as a universal way. We argue that the geographical influence on users' check-in behaviors should be personalized. In this paper, we propose a personalized and efficient geographical location recommendation framework called iGeoRec to take full advantage of the geographical influence on location recommendations. In iGeoRec, there are mainly two challenges: (1) personalizing the geographical influence to accurately predict the probability of a user visiting a new location, and (2) efficiently computing the probability of each user to all new locations. To address these two challenges, (1) we propose a probabilistic approach to personalize the geographical influence as a personal distribution for each user and predict the probability of a user visiting any new location using her personal distribution. Furthermore, (2) we develop an efficient approximation method to compute the probability of any user to all new locations; the proposed method reduces the computational complexity of the exact computation method from O(|L|n3) to O(|L|n) (where |L| is the total number of locations in an LBSN and $n$ is the number of check-in locations of a user). Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the recommendation accuracy and efficiency of iGeoRec using two large-scale real data sets collected from the two of the most popular LBSNs: Foursquare and Gowalla. Experimental results show that iGeoRec provides significantly superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art geographical recommendation techniques.","authors":["Jia-Dong Zhang","Chi-Yin ChowMember","Yanhua Li"],"meta":["September 2015IEEE Transactions on Services Computing 8(5):701-714","DOI:10.1109/TSC.2014.2328341"],"references":["286950487_Where_you_like_to_go_next_Successive_point-of-interest_recommendation","272389361_Recommendations_in_location-based_social_networks_A_survey","262356000_Time-aware_point-of-interest_recommendation","262350230_gSCorr_Modeling_Geo-Social_Correlations_for_New_Check-ins_on_Location-Based_Social_Networks","262237220_Location-based_and_preference-aware_recommendation_using_sparse_geo-social_networking_data","254464991_Urban_point-of-interest_recommendation_by_mining_user_check-in_behaviors","234108128_A_Random_Walk_Around_the_City_New_Venue_Recommendation_in_Location-Based_Social_Networks","232654435_Personalized_QoS-Aware_Web_Service_Recommendation_and_Visualization","224207506_Robust_Point_Set_Registration_Using_Gaussian_Mixture_Models","220593852_Comparison_of_collaborative_filtering_algorithms_Limitations_of_current_techniques_and_proposals_for_scalable_high-performance_recommender_systems","220182129_Efficient_Kernel_Density_Estimation_Using_the_Fast_Gauss_Transform_with_Applications_to_Color_Modeling_and_Tracking","12752937_Learning_the_Parts_of_Objects_by_Non-Negative_Matrix_Factorization","5328225_Understanding_Individual_Human_Mobility_Patterns","313550720_IGSLR_Personalized_geo-social_location_recommendation_-_A_kernel_density_estimation_approach","305007546_An_inequality_for_Hermite_polynomials","301222357_Toward_the_next_generation_of_recommender_systems_A_survey_of_the_state-of-the-art_and_possible_extensions","285809856_Fused_matrix_factorization_with_geographical_and_social_influence_in_location-based_social_networks","278713347_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","276948045_Comparison_of_collaborative_filtering_algorithms","266654624_Spatial_topic_modeling_in_online_social_media_for_location_recommendation","262357081_From_face-to-face_gathering_to_social_structure","262322411_iGSLR_personalized_geo-social_location_recommendation","262250389_Geo_topic_model_Joint_modeling_of_user's_activity_area_and_interests_for_location_recommendation","262216364_Personalized_point-of-interest_recommendation_by_mining_users'_preference_transition","261860600_Learning_geographical_preferences_for_point-of-interest_recommendation","260711914_Personalized_Web_Service_Recommendation_via_Normal_Recovery_Collaborative_Filtering","260636768_Collaborative_Web_Service_QoS_Prediction_via_Neighborhood_Integrated_Matrix_Factorization","257457811_Clustering_and_aggregating_clues_of_trajectories_for_mining_trajectory_patterns_and_routes","255564551_Towards_Mobile_Intelligence_Learning_from_GPS_History_Data_for_Collaborative_Recommendation","254042543_LARS_A_location-aware_recommender_system","248035707_The_Three_Sigma_Rule","243052149_An_Inequality_for_Hermite_Polynomials","236736854_The_Fast_Gauss_Transform","224574578_Matrix_factorization_techniques_for_recommender_systems_IEEE_Computer_Journal_428_30-37","224226989_Simplified_Computation_for_Nonparametric_Windows_Method_of_Probability_Density_Function_Estimation","222473678_Clustering_to_minimize_the_maximum_intercluster_distance","221654258_Friendship_and_Mobility_User_Movement_In_Location-Based_Social_Networks","221602930_Collaborative_Filtering_Meets_Mobile_Recommendation_A_User-Centered_Approach","221589961_Location_recommendation_for_location-based_social_networks","221301009_CLR_a_collaborative_location_recommendation_framework_based_on_co-clustering","221299787_Exploiting_geographical_influence_for_collaborative_point-of-interest_recommendation","221022923_Distributed_nonnegative_matrix_factorization_for_web-scale_dyadic_data_analysis_on_MapReduce","221022335_Collaborative_location_and_activity_recommendations_with_GPS_history_data","220593821_Recommending_Friends_and_Locations_Based_on_Individual_Location_History","44366367_Density_Estimation_For_Statistics_And_Data_Analysis","4038399_Improved_Fast_Gauss_Transform_and_Efficient_Kernel_Density_Estimation","3419436_Personalization_and_privacy"]}
