{"id":"251060246_Evaluating_the_Fit_of_Structural_Equation_Models_Tests_of_Significance_and_Descriptive_Goodness-of-Fit_Measures","abstract":"For structural equation models, a huge variety of fit indices has been developed. These indices, however, can point to conflicting conclusions about the extent to which a model actually matches the observed data. The present article provides some guide-lines that should help applied researchers to evaluate the adequacy of a given struc-tural equation model. First, as goodness-of-fit measures depend on the method used for parameter estimation, maximum likelihood (ML) and weighted least squares (WLS) methods are introduced in the context of structural equation modeling. Then, the most common goodness-of-fit indices are discussed and some recommendations for practitioners given. Finally, we generated an artificial data set according to a \"true\" model and analyzed two misspecified and two correctly specified models as examples of poor model fit, adequate fit, and good fit. In structural equation modeling (SEM), a model is said to fit the observed data to the extent that the model-implied covariance matrix is equivalent to the empirical co-variance matrix. Once a model has been specified and the empirical covariance matrix is given, a method has to be selected for parameter estimation. Different estimation meth-ods have different distributional assumptions and have different discrepancy functions to be minimized. When the estimation procedure has converged to a reasonable","authors":["Karin Schermelleh-Engel","Helfried Moosbrugger","Hans Müller"],"meta":["May 2003MPR-online 8(8):23–74"],"references":["320928699_Structural_Equation_Modeling","290110225_Prediction_and_Entropy","289963720_Confirmatory_factor_analysis_Strategies_for_small_sample_sizes","285441572_Effects_of_sample_size_estimation_methods_and_model_specification_on_structural_equation_modeling_fit_indexes","285321410_EQS_6_Structural_Equations_Program_Manual","285058846_Mplus_The_comprehensive_modelling_program_for_applied_researchers","276948494_Sample_Size_Effects_on_Chi_Square_and_Other_Statistics_Used_in_Evaluating_Causal_Models","271196714_New_Look_at_Statistical-Model_Identification","264402817_A_comparison_of_some_methodologies_for_the_factor_analysis_of_non-normal_Likert_variables_A_note_on_the_size_of_the_model","261649835_Structural_Model_Evaluation_And_Modification_-_An_Interval_Estimation_Approach"]}
