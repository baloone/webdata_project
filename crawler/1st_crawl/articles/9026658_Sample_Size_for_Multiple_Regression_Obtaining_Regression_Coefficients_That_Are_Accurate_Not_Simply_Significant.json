{"id":"9026658_Sample_Size_for_Multiple_Regression_Obtaining_Regression_Coefficients_That_Are_Accurate_Not_Simply_Significant","abstract":"An approach to sample size planning for multiple regression is presented that emphasizes accuracy in parameter estimation (AIPE). The AIPE approach yields precise estimates of population parameters by providing necessary sample sizes in order for the likely widths of confidence intervals to be sufficiently narrow. One AIPE method yields a sample size such that the expected width of the confidence interval around the standardized population regression coefficient is equal to the width specified. An enhanced formulation ensures, with some stipulated probability, that the width of the confidence interval will be no larger than the width specified. Issues involving standardized regression coefficients and random predictors are discussed, as are the philosophical differences between AIPE and the power analytic approaches to sample size planning.","authors":["Ken Kelley","Scott E Maxwell"],"meta":["October 2003Psychological Methods 8(3):305-21","DOI:10.1037/1082-989X.8.3.305","SourcePubMed"],"references":["289963792_Noncentrality_Interval_Estimation_and_the_Evaluation_of_Statistical_Models","289963661_Statistical_methods_in_psychology_journals_Guidelines_and_explanations","289116677_Non-linear_Regression_Models","285281841_Improved_Standard_Errors_of_Standardized_Parameters_in_Covariance_Structure_Models_Implications_for_Construct_Explication","274565005_The_Earth_is_Round_p_05","274180316_Kendall's_Advanced_Theory_of_Statistics_Volume_1_5th_Edition","271690558_The_Sensitivity_of_Confirmatory_Maximum_Likelihood_Factor_Analysis_to_Violations_of_Measurement_Scale_and_Distributional_Assumptions","267472630_Latent_variable_models_An_introduction_to_factor_path_and_structural_equation_analysis_Fourth_edition","266176864_A_Tale_of_Two_Regressions","265590197_Linear_Models_in_Statistics"]}
