{"id":"349424853_Games_Based_Learning_for_Computer_Science_Education_A_Systematic_Literature_Review","abstract":"Educational games are assumed to be an effective and efficient instructional strategy for computing education. The trend using educational games in elementary levels also applied to higher education level. Recently, researchers have shown an increased interest in using games in computer science. In this paper, we are presenting a systematic review and analysis of 6410 papers regarding games in computer science that was published within 2015 and above. After applying our inclusion criteria and inspection of these studies, we have ended up with 26 papers was selected. Based on a systematic process, we reported and discussed our findings with possible future research directions. The results of this study indicate that the studies are accumulated around 4 categories: Games that learners or students play, games that learners or students develop as projects, curriculum proposals, and developing or coming up with new approaches, tools, frameworks or suggestions","authors":["Noor Azli","Noor Azli Mohamed Masrop","Siti Hafawati","Juzlinda Ghazali"],"meta":["December 2019"],"references":["317618056_Programming_video_games_and_simulations_in_science_education_exploring_computational_thinking_through_code_analysis","317396145_Room_escape_at_class_Escape_games_activities_to_facilitate_the_motivation_and_learning_in_computer_science","315437614_Computing_as_Empirical_Science_-_Evolution_of_a_Concept","313585055_Game_Development_for_Computer_Science_Education","312530807_Software_Engineering_Education_and_Games_A_Systematic_Literature_Review","333072412_Serious_Games_in_Computer_Science_Learning_Goals","326181402_Student's_Opinions_on_Online_Educational_Games_for_Learning_Programming_Introductory","325350756_Serious_games_Using_abstract_strategy_games_in_computer_science_2_An_experience_report_and_lessons_learned","319394519_Computer_Science_as_empirical_inquiry_Symbols_and_search","315472671_Gamification_to_Engage_and_Motivate_Students_to_Achieve_Computer_Science_Learning_Goals","311626002_Conceptualising_engagement_with_digital_behaviour_change_interventions_a_systematic_review_using_principles_from_critical_interpretive_synthesis","312118161_How_games_for_computing_education_are_evaluated_A_systematic_literature_review","311670676_Computer_card_games_in_computer_science_education_A_10-year_review","309965980_The_Effects_of_a_Robot_Game_Environment_on_Computer_Programming_Education_for_Elementary_School_Students","308734573_Learning_Outcome_Enhancement_via_Serious_Game_Implementing_Game-Based_Learning_Framework_in_Blended_Learning_Environment"]}
