{"id":"263352453_Asymptotic_Theory_for_Density_Ridges","abstract":"The large sample theory of estimators for density modes is well-understood.\nIn this paper we consider density ridges, which are a higher-dimensional\nextension of modes. Modes correspond to zero-dimensional, local high-density\nregions in point clouds. Density ridges correspond to $s$-dimensional, local\nhigh-density regions in point clouds. We establish three main results. First we\nshow that, under appropriate regularity conditions, the local variation of the\nestimated ridge can be approximated by an empirical process. Second, we show\nthat the distribution of the estimated ridge converges to a Gaussian process.\nThird, we establish that the bootstrap leads to valid confidence sets for\ndensity ridges.","authors":["Yen-Chi Chen","Christopher R.
