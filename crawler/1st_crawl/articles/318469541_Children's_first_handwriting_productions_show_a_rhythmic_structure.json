{"id":"318469541_Children's_first_handwriting_productions_show_a_rhythmic_structure","abstract":"Although much research has been concerned with the development of kinematic aspects of handwriting, little is known about the development along with age of two principles that govern its rhythmic organization: Homothety and Isochrony. Homothety states that the ratio between the durations of the single motor events composing a motor act remains invariant and independent from the total duration of the movement. Isochrony refers to the proportional relationship between the speed of movement execution and the length of its trajectory. The current study shows that children comply with both principles since their first grade of primary school. The precocious adherence to these principles suggests that an internal representation of the rhythm of handwriting is available before the age in which handwriting is performed automatically. Overall, these findings suggest that despite being a cultural acquisition, handwriting appears to be shaped by more general constraints on the timing planning of the movements.","authors":["Elena Pagliarini","Lisa Scocchia","Mirta Vernice","Marina Zoppello"],"meta":["July 2017Scientific Reports 7(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-017-05105-6","Project: Rhythmic principles in writing"],"references":["261330227_Hierarchical_processing_in_music_language_and_action_Lashley_revisited","257343915_Models_of_human_movement_Trajectory_planning_and_inverse_kinematics_studies","345762113_Ecrire","313102255_The_central_representation_of_learned_motor_patterns","284658314_Sur_la_vitesse_des_mouvements_graphiques","282873292_Cathodal_transcranial_direct_current_stimulation_can_stabilize_perception_of_movement_Evidence_from_the_two-thirds_power_law_illusion","282315733_A_longitudinal_study_on_the_structure_of_handwriting","277925715_Ethical_Principles_for_Medical_Research_Involving_Human_SubjectsWorld_Medical_Association_Declaration_of_HelsinkiJAMA2013310202191219424141714","277478202_Dyslexic_children_fail_to_comply_with_the_rhythmic_constraints_of_handwriting","254734015_Mechanism_of_the_different_types_of_movement"]}
