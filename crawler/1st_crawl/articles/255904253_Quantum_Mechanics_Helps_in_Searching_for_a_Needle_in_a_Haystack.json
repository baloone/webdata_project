{"id":"255904253_Quantum_Mechanics_Helps_in_Searching_for_a_Needle_in_a_Haystack","abstract":"Quantum mechanics can speed up a range of search applications over unsorted data. For example, imagine a phone directory containing N names arranged in completely random order. To find someone`s phone number with a probability of 50{percent}, any classical algorithm (whether deterministic or probabilistic) will need to access the database a minimum of 0.5N times. Quantum mechanical systems can be in a superposition of states and simultaneously examine multiple names. By properly adjusting the phases of various operations, successful computations reinforce each other while others interfere randomly. As a result, the desired phone number can be obtained in only O({radical}(N)) accesses to the database. {copyright} {ital 1997} {ital The American Physical Society}","authors":["Lov K.
