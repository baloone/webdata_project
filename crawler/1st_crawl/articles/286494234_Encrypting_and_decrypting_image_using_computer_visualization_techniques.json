{"id":"286494234_Encrypting_and_decrypting_image_using_computer_visualization_techniques","abstract":"Today's networks are essential to our modern world, and a thorough understanding of how they act is vital to their efficient operation. Fortunately, data on networks is plentiful; by visualizing this network data, it is possible to greatly improve our understanding and also should provide the security for network data. The motivation of this paper is on visualizing the network data associated with a network image or object that will be send in the format of image at the sender and at the receiver ends that image or object will be encrypted in the form of rich text format that will be decrypted form at the receiver end. The technique sending data in image format will provide a greatest security for World Wide Web data transmission on network. We can also visualize that what data is behind on image and rendering of the image. Finally, this proposal is trying to encrypt and decrypt image visualization using computer visualization techniques.","authors":["G. Gunasekaran","B.K.
