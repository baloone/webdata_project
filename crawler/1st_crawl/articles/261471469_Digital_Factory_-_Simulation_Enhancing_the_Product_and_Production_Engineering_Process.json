{"id":"261471469_Digital_Factory_-_Simulation_Enhancing_the_Product_and_Production_Engineering_Process","abstract":"The digital factory concept offers an integrated approach to enhance the product and production engineering processes and simulation is a key technology within this concept. Different types of simulation, such as discrete event or 3D-motion simulation can be applied in virtual models on various planning levels and stages to improve the product and process planning on all levels. The focus and key factor is the integration of the various planning and simulation processes. In an advanced stage simulation technology can be applied in the digital factory concept to enhance the operative production planning and control as an integrated process from the top level to the factory floor control","authors":["Wolfgang Kuhn"],"meta":["December 2006Proceedings - Winter Simulation Conference","DOI:10.1109/WSC.2006.322972","Conference: Simulation Conference, 2006.
