{"id":"315570270_A_proof_of_the_ErdHos-Sands-Sauer-Woodrow_conjecture","abstract":"A very nice result of B\\'ar\\'any and Lehel asserts that every finite subset $X$ or $\\mathbb R^d$ can be covered by $f(d)$ $X$-boxes (i.e. each box has two antipodal points in $X$). As shown by Gy\\'arf\\'as and P\\'alv\\H{o}lgyi this result would follow from the following conjecture : If a tournament admits a partition of its arc set into $k$ quasi orders, then its domination number is bounded in terms of $k$. This question is in turn implied by the Erd\\H{o}s-Sands-Sauer-Woodrow conjecture : If the arcs of a tournament $T$ are colored with $k$ colors, there is a set $X$ of at most $g(k)$ vertices such that for every vertex $v$ of $T$, there is a monochromatic path from $X$ to $v$. We give a short proof of this statement. We moreover show that the general Sands-Sauer-Woodrow conjecture (which as a special case implies the stable marriage theorem) is valid for directed graphs with bounded stability number. This conjecture remains however open.","authors":["Nicolas Bousquet","William Lochet","Stéphan Thomassé"],"meta":["March 2017Journal of Combinatorial Theory Series B 137","DOI:10.1016/j.jctb.2018.11.005"],"references":["265521433_Kernels_by_monochromatic_directed_paths_in_3-colored_tournaments_and_quasi-tournaments","257635257_Kernels_in_Weighted_Digraphs","276596500_On_Weighted_Kernels_of_Two_Posets","262280004_Covering_with_Euclidean_Boxes","243788242_On_monochromatic_paths_in_m-coloured_tournaments","235645414_Domination_in_transitive_colorings_of_tournaments","223149024_On_monochromatic_paths_in_edge-coloured_digraphs","222632875_Monochromatic_sinks_in_nearly_transitive_arc-colored_tournaments","222575665_Dominating_sets_in_k-majority_tournaments","222418757_On_a_Lemma_of_Scarf","220568661_Probabilities_Within_optimal_Strategies_for_Tournament_Games","220442729_A_Fixed-Point_Approach_to_Stable_Matchings_and_Some_Applications","220397687_Monochromatic_Paths_and_at_Most_2-Coloured_Arc_Sets_in_Edge-Coloured_Tournaments","37464993_A_Remark_on_Transversal_Numbers"]}
