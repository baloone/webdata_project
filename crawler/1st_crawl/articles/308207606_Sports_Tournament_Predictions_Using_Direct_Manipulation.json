{"id":"308207606_Sports_Tournament_Predictions_Using_Direct_Manipulation","abstract":"An advanced interface for sports tournament predictions uses direct manipulation to allow users to make nonlinear predictions. Unlike previous interface designs, the interface helps users focus on their prediction tasks by enabling them to first choose a winner and then fill out the rest of the bracket. In real-world tests of the proposed interface (for the 2014 FIFA World Cup tournament and 2015/2016 UEFA Champions League), the authors validated the use of direct manipulation as an alternative to widgets. Using visitor interaction logs, they were able to determine the strategies people use to perform predictions and identify potential areas of improvement for further prediction interfaces.","authors":["Romain Vuillemot","Charles Perin"],"meta":["September 2016IEEE engineering in medicine and biology magazine: the quarterly magazine of the Engineering in Medicine & Biology Society 36(5)","DOI:10.1109/MCG.2016.90","Project: direct manipulation"],"references":["281471839_Suggested_Interactivity_Seeking_Perceived_Affordances_for_Information_Visualization","280699898_Investigating_the_Direct_Manipulation_of_Ranking_Tables_for_Time_Navigation","262563262_A_Table_Improving_Temporal_Navigation_in_Soccer_Ranking_Tables","254004975_Dwell-and-Spring_Undo_for_Direct_Manipulation","319482059_The_grammar_of_graphics","316798474_The_Grammar_of_Graphics","273392630_DimpVis_Exploring_Time-varying_Information_Visualizations_by_Direct_Manipulation","273392385_Finding_Waldo_Learning_about_Users_from_their_Interactions","243103007_The_Grammar_of_GraphicsThe_Grammar_of_Graphics_2nd_ed","221516214_Adaptive_semantic_snaping---a_technique_for_semantic_feedback_at_the_lexical_level"]}
