{"id":"347584125_Using_the_Maple_computer_algebra_system_to_study_mathematical_induction","abstract":"Mathematical induction is one of the main methods of the proof that students study and use it in their studies in higher education. This important method, in addition to mathematics, is widely used in computer science and a number of other related disciplines. However, even if the principles of proof using the method of induction are taught, understood and mastered by students well, many students have great difficulty with algebraic transformations necessary for proving, for example, finding the inductive step. The use of the Maple computer algebra system allows students to overcome this obstacle and, more attention and effort to pay to understanding the concept of proofs using the method of mathematical induction. In addition, students can prove more complex algebraic statements, and their activities can be of a pronounced research nature.","authors":["A A Olenev","A V Shuvaev","M V Migacheva","E S Kulevskaya"],"meta":["November 2020Journal of Physics Conference Series 1691(1):012102","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/1691/1/012102"],"references":["337354168_Proof_of_the_method_of_paired_zeroing_of_numbers_in_a_residue_system","236021541_An_innovative_learning_model_for_computation_in_first_year_mathematics","233267389_Learning_number_theory_with_a_computer_algebra_system","233037782_Using_a_Computer_Algebra_System_to_Facilitate_the_Learning_of_Mathematical_Induction","232850259_Using_a_computer_algebra_system_to_teach_double_integration","229350294_An_interactive_teaching_and_learning_environment_for_graph_sketching","228578228_Teaching_Electrical_Engineering_Using_Maple"]}
