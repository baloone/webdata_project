{"id":"269328531_Automated_attendance_management_system_based_on_face_recognition_algorithms","abstract":"In this paper we propose an automated attendance management system. This system, which is based on face detection and recognition algorithms, automatically detects the student when he enters the class room and marks the attendance by recognizing him. The system architecture and algorithms used in each stage are described in this paper. Different real time scenarios are considered to evaluate the performance of various face recognition systems. This paper also proposes the techniques to be used in order to handle the threats like spoofing. When compared to traditional attendance marking this system saves the time and also helps to monitor the students.","authors":["Shireesha Chintalapati","M. V.
