{"id":"257312763_New_graphs_related_to_p6_and_p8-cages","abstract":"Constructing regular graphs with a given girth, a given degree and the fewest possible vertices is hard. This problem is called the cage graph problem and has some links with the error code theory. GG-graphs can be used in many applications: symmetric and semi-symmetric graph constructions, (Bretto and Gillibert (2008) [12]), hamiltonicity of Cayley graphs, and so on. In this paper, we show that GG-graphs can be a good tool to construct some upper bounds for the cage problem. For pp odd prime we construct (p,6)(p,6)-graphs which are GG-graphs with orders 2p22p2 and 2p2−22p2−2, when the Sauer bound is equal to 4(p−1)34(p−1)3. We construct also (p,8)(p,8)-GG-graphs with orders 2p32p3 and 2p3−2p2p3−2p, while the Sauer upper bound is equal to 4(p−1)54(p−1)5.","authors":["Alain Bretto","Alain Faisant","Luc Gillibert"],"meta":["September 2011Computers & Mathematics with Applications 62(6):2472–2479","DOI:10.1016/j.camwa.2011.07.033","Sourcedx.doi.org"],"references":["235410068_Algebraic_Graph_Theory","287182796_Extremaleigenschaften_regularer_Graphen_gegebener_Taillenweite_I_and_II_Sitzungsberichte_Osterreich","265702777_Another_way_for_associating_a_graph_to_a_group","265334058_Extremaleigenschaften_regularer_Graphen_gegebener_Taillenweite_I_II","257283296_Finite_groups","246780128_MathWorld-A_Wolfram_Web_Resource","231926597_A_Family_of_cubical_graphs","229765687_Cubic_Graphs_with_Large_Girth","229754895_Cages-A_survey","224750472_Large_Girth_Cycle_Codes_for_Partial_Response_Channels"]}
