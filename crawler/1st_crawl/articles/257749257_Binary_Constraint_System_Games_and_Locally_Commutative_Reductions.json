{"id":"257749257_Binary_Constraint_System_Games_and_Locally_Commutative_Reductions","abstract":"A binary constraint system game is a two-player one-round non-local game\ndefined by a system of Boolean constraints. The game has a perfect quantum\nstrategy if and only if the constraint system has a quantum satisfying\nassignment [R. Cleve, arXiv:1209.2729]. We show that several concepts including\nthe quantum chromatic number and the Kochen-Specker sets that arose from\ndifferent contexts fit naturally in the binary constraint system framework. The\nstructure and complexity of the quantum satisfiability problems for these\nconstraint systems are investigated. Combined with a new construct called the\ncommutativity gadget for each problem, several classic NP-hardness reductions\nare lifted to their corresponding quantum versions. We also provide a simple\nparity constraint game that requires $\\Omega(\\sqrt{n})$ EPR pairs in perfect\nstrategies where $n$ is the number of variables in the constraint system.","authors":["Zhengfeng Ji"],"meta":["October 2013","SourcearXiv"],"references":["260542715_New_Separations_in_Zero-Error_Channel_Capacity_Through_Projective_Kochen-Specker_Sets_and_Quantum_Coloring","252991823_Grobner_Bases_for_Noncommutative_Polynomials","228356664_Quantum_mysteries_revisited_again","228109500_Proposed_Experiment_to_Test_Local_Hidden-Variable_Theories","221591362_Multi-Prover_Interactive_Proofs_How_to_Remove_Intractability_Assumptions","221499638_Non-Deterministic_Exponential_Time_Has_Two-Prover_Interactive_Protocols","48172437_Parallel_Repetition_of_Entangled_Games","2203643_Cost_of_Exactly_Simulating_Quantum_Entanglement_with_Classical_Communication","2199050_On_the_Quantum_Chromatic_Number_of_a_Graph","2193380_Quantum_Pseudo-Telepathy","323130140_On_the_Einstein_Podolsky_Rosen_paradox","311973351_Quantum_Theory_Concepts_and_Methods","268023060_Characterization_of_Binary_Constraint_System_Games","265716354_Fundamentals_of_the_Theory_of_Operator_Algebras_Elementary_Theory","265367620_The_Problem_of_Hidden_Variables_in_Quantum_Theory","250664766_Quantum_analogues_of_the_Bell_inequalities_The_case_of_two_spatially_separated_domains","246965033_Noncommutative_Grobner_Bases_and_Projective_Resolutions","243658561_Hidden_Variables_and_the_Two_Teorems_of_John_Bell_Rev_of_Mod_Phys_65803","239535663_Two-prover_one-round_proof_systems_Their_power_and_their_problems","239061281_On_the_Problem_of_Hidden_Variables_in_Quantum_Mechanics","236628854_Computational_Complexity","230868318_Extending_and_Characterizing_Quantum_Magic_Games","228109650_Quantum_Theory_Concepts_and_Methods","228109469_On_the_Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen_paradox","228102665_A_Multi-prover_Interactive_Proof_for_NEXP_Sound_against_Entangled_Provers","226089277_Kochen-Specker_Theorem","222602367_Incompatible_results_of_quantum_measurements","222487411_An_introduction_to_commutative_and_noncommutative_Grobner_bases","221591509_Exponential_separation_of_quantum_and_classical_one-way_communication_complexity","221591101_The_Complexity_of_Theorem-Proving_Procedures","221590732_The_Complexity_of_Satisfiability_Problems","221590483_Two-Prover_One-Round_Proof_Systems_Their_Power_and_Their_Problems_Extended_Abstract","220467805_Perfect_Parallel_Repetition_Theorem_for_Quantum_Xor_Proof_Systems","220118441_Linear-Time_Algorithms_for_Testing_the_Satisfiability_of_Propositional_Horn_Formulae","220114576_A_Linear-Time_Algorithm_for_Testing_the_Truth_of_Certain_Quantified_Boolean_Formulas","200524403_Quantum_Computation_and_Quantum_Information","51909961_Kochen-Specker_Sets_and_the_Rank-1_Quantum_Chromatic_Number","50333158_Elements_of_the_Theory_of_Representations","45929066_Lower_bounds_on_the_entanglement_needed_to_play_XOR_non-local_games","13246875_Simple_unified_form_for_the_major_no-hidden-variables_theorems","4257922_Perfect_Parallel_Repetition_Theorem_for_Quantum_XOR_Proof_Systems","4082652_Consequences_and_limits_of_nonlocal_strategies","2940748_Quantum_Pseudo-Telepathy_and_the_Kochen-Specker_Theorem","2503999_A_Parallel_Repetition_Theorem","2493479_Some_optimal_inapproximability_results","1768124_Unique_Games_with_Entangled_Provers_Are_Easy"]}
