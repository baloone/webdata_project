{"id":"319858005_Development_and_clinical_application_of_radiomics_in_lung_cancer","abstract":"Since the discovery of X-rays at the end of the 19th century, medical imageology has progressed for 100 years, and medical imaging has become an important auxiliary tool for clinical diagnosis. With the launch of the human genome project (HGP) and the development of various high-throughput detection techniques, disease exploration in the post-genome era has extended beyond investigations of structural changes to in-depth analyses of molecular abnormalities in tissues, organs and cells, on the basis of gene expression and epigenetics. These techniques have given rise to genomics, proteomics, metabolomics and other systems biology subspecialties, including radiogenomics. Radiogenomics is an important revolution in the traditional visually identifiable imaging technology and constitutes a new branch, radiomics. Radiomics is aimed at extracting quantitative imaging features automatically and developing models to predict lesion phenotypes in a non-invasive manner. Here, we summarize the advent and development of radiomics, the basic process and challenges in clinical practice, with a focus on applications in pulmonary nodule evaluations, including diagnostics, pathological and molecular classifications, treatment response assessments and prognostic predictions, especially in radiotherapy.","authors":["Bojiang Chen","Rui Zhang","Yuncui Gan","Lan Yang"],"meta":["September 2017Radiation Oncology 12(1)","DOI:10.1186/s13014-017-0885-x"],"references":["318504826_The_role_of_tumour_heterogeneity_and_clonal_cooperativity_in_metastasis_immune_evasion_and_clinical_outcome","316652629_Imaging_features_from_pre-treatment_CT_scans_are_associated_with_clinical_outcomes_in_non-small-cell_lung_cancer_patients_treated_with_stereotactic_body_radiotherapy","314028680_High-Throughput_Genomic_Profiling_of_Adult_Solid_Tumors_Reveals_Novel_Insights_into_Cancer_Pathogenesis","312188589_Associations_of_Radiomic_Data_Extracted_from_Static_and_Respiratory-Gated_CT_Scans_with_Disease_Recurrence_in_Lung_Cancer_Patients_Treated_with_SBRT","320977252_Management_of_EGFR_Mutation-Positive_Non-Small_Cell_Lung_Cancer","317153948_Radiomics-Based_Assessment_of_Radiation-Induced_Lung_Injury_after_Stereotactic_Body_Radiotherapy","316690549_Comparison_of_Breast_Cancer_Molecular_Features_and_Survival_by_African_and_European_Ancestry_in_The_Cancer_Genome_Atlas","316117383_Genomic_Profiling_of_Advanced_Non-Small_Cell_Lung_Cancer_in_Community_Settings_Gaps_and_Opportunities","308768651_Detection_of_Local_Cancer_Recurrence_After_Stereotactic_Ablative_Radiation_Therapy_SABR_for_Lung_Cancer_Physician_Performance_Versus_Radiomic_Assessment","308173063_Targeting_the_cancer_epigenome_for_therapy"]}
