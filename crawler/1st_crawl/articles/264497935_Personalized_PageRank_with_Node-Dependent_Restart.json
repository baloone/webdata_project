{"id":"264497935_Personalized_PageRank_with_Node-Dependent_Restart","abstract":"Personalized PageRank is an algorithm to classify the improtance of web pages\non a user-dependent basis. We introduce two generalizations of Personalized\nPageRank with node-dependent restart. The first generalization is based on the\nproportion of visits to nodes before the restart, whereas the second\ngeneralization is based on the probability of visited node just before the\nrestart. In the original case of constant restart probability, the two measures\ncoincide. We discuss interesting particular cases of restart probabilities and\nrestart distributions. We show that the both generalizations of Personalized\nPageRank have an elegant expression connecting the so-called direct and reverse\nPersonalized PageRanks that yield a symmetry property of these Personalized\nPageRanks.","authors":["K.
