{"id":"323997823_Instructional_methods_in_computing_education_judged_by_computer_science_teachers_and_educational_experts","abstract":"Answers to the questions of which instructional methods are suitable for school, what instructional methods should be applied in teaching individual subjects and how instructional methods support the act of learning represent challenges to general education and education in individual subjects. This article focuses on empirical examinations of instructional methods for computer science education supporting knowledge processes in the act of learning and their integration into the context of significant learning theories. The results of this article show that certain instructional methods are especially predestined for computer science education. They can also be attributed to behavioristic, cognitivist and constructivist learning theories; they are thereby localized and can profit from the empirical findings of the learning theories, especially in practical use on teaching computer science.","authors":["Andreas Zendler"],"meta":["April 2018it - Information Technology 60(2):79-90","DOI:10.1515/itit-2017-0015"],"references":["300670348_Teaching_Programming_and_Problem_Solving_The_Current_State","292006959_Behaviorism_and_Instructional_Technology","286498325_Instructional_Methods_to_Computer_Science_Education_as_Investigated_by_Computer_Science_Teachers","228658634_Do_All_Roads_Lead_to_Rome_or_Reductions_for_Dummy_Travelers","228411501_NEURODIDACTICS-A_NEW_STIMULUS_IN_ICT_AND_COMPUTER_SCIENCE_EDUCATION","220690137_Didaktik_der_Informatik_-_Grundlagen_Konzepte_Beispiele","345950901_Didaktik_der_Informatik","334349642_Cognitive_Apprenticeship_Teaching_the_Crafts_of_Reading_Writing_and_Mathematics","329319546_Human_Reliability_Assessment_Theory_and_Practice","315504133_Didaktik_der_Informatik","305267748_Neuroscience_Exploring_the_brain_Fourth_edition","303270804_Cognitive_apprenticeship_Teaching_the_crafts_of_reading_writing_mathematics","300115275_Privilege_and_Computer_Science_Education","297949514_Neuroscience_in_Education_The_good_the_bad_and_the_ugly","297514300_Educational_Psychology","283759984_Computer_science_education_teaching_methods_An_overview_of_the_literature","282120515_Profound_Improvement_Building_Learning-Community_Capacity_on_Living_System_Principles_2nd_ed","274815072_An_Educational_Psychology_of_Learning","272442286_Teaching_the_teachers_a_practical_guide","271722203_The_Effect_of_Teaching_Methods_and_Learning_Style_on_Learning_Program_Design_in_Web-Based_Education_Systems","266992922_Guide_to_teaching_computer_science_An_activity-based_approach","265092083_Informatikunterricht_planen_und_durchfuhren","262355426_A_Model-Driven_Approach_to_Teaching_Concurrency","262320563_Uncovering_structure_behind_function_-_The_experiment_as_teaching_method_in_computer_science_education","258761381_Classroom_Live_A_software-assisted_gamification_tool","250888371_Holistic_approach_to_learning_and_teaching_introductory_object-oriented_programming","250888350_EXtreme_Teaching_A_framework_for_continuous_improvement","238085418_Glossary_slightly_edited_From_Petrina_S_2006_Advanced_teaching_methods_for_the_technology_classroom_Hershey_PA_Information_Science_Publishing_What_is_Technology_Studies","234828698_Theory_of_computing_in_computer_science_education","234709561_Cognitive_Apprenticeship_Teaching_the_Craft_of_Reading_Writing_and_Mathematics_Technical_Report_No_403","234613083_Children_Teach_Children_Learning_by_Teaching","233057723_The_didactic_model_LdL_Lernen_durch_Lehren_as_a_way_of_preparing_students_for_communication_in_a_knowledge_society","229525294_Principles_of_Instructional_Design","228599320_An_Empirical_Evaluation_of_Using_Constructive_Classroom_Activities_to_Teach_Introductory_Programming","221545537_Teaching_Programming_and_Problem_Solving","220547312_Cognitive_Psychology","48130878_The_Process_of_Education","48130877_The_Process_of_Education","44837850_Learning_in_Adulthood_A_Comprehensive_Guide","44826792_Profound_improvement_Building_capacity_for_a_learning_community","31645126_Educational_Psychology_theory_into_practice_R_E_Slavin","2384204_First_Principles_of_Instruction"]}
