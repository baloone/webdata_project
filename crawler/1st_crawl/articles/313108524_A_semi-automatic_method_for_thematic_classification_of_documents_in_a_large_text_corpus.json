{"id":"313108524_A_semi-automatic_method_for_thematic_classification_of_documents_in_a_large_text_corpus","abstract":"One of the essential steps in the analysis of large document collections is the thematic classification of those documents. As technical capabilities for document acquisition and storage have increased significantly, text corpora have grown to sizes which make manual analysis by humans infeasible. For that reason, it is necessary to design processes of document analysis which take this problem into account. This paper describes a method for the thematic classification of a large collection of documents. If done manually, this process would require an enormous amount of human work. Instead, a semi-automatic method based on keyword classification is proposed and evaluated.","authors":["Łukasz Borchmann","Filip Graliński","Rafał Jaworski","Piotr Wierzchoń"],"meta":["January 2015","Conference: Workshop on Corpus-Based Research in the Humanities (CRH)At: Warsaw"],"references":["51969319_Scikit-learn_Machine_Learning_in_Python","346696764_Normalized_cuts_and_image_segmentation","292766142_Modern_Information_Retrieval_A_Brief_Overview","228743668_Similarity_measures_for_text_document_clustering","221654332_Collaborative_topic_modeling_for_recommending_scientific_articles","221023215_Web-scale_k-means_clustering","2477494_Normalized_Cuts_and_Image_Segmentation"]}
