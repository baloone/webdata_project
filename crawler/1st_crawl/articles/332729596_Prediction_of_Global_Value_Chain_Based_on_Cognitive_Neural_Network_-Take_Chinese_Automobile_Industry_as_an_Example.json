{"id":"332729596_Prediction_of_Global_Value_Chain_Based_on_Cognitive_Neural_Network_-Take_Chinese_Automobile_Industry_as_an_Example","abstract":"Cognitive artificial neural network is a hot research field which is an important part of human intelligence research. In recent years, artificial neural network has been used in the fields of neuroscience, computer science, cognitive science, mathematics and physics. With the Chinese automobile industry as the research object, the global value chain as the research tool, and the promotion of Chinese automobile industry cluster as the research objective, This paper deals with information processing by simulating neural activity in the brain according to the cognitive artificial neural network to study the upgrading of Chinese automobile industry cluster, and puts forward the related suggestion on the upgrading of Chinese automobile industry cluster. This study believes that in order to promote the upgrading of Chinese automobile industry cluster, itâ€™s essential to promote the independent innovation of enterprises in the cluster and indispensable to strengthen government support, which has certain guiding significance to the development of Chinese automobile industry cluster.","authors":["Qi Yang"],"meta":["April 2019Translational Neuroscience 10(1):81-86","DOI:10.1515/tnsci-2019-0014"],"references":["322911854_High_concentrations_of_fatty_acids_and_b-hydroxybutyrate_impair_the_growth_hormone-mediated_hepatic_JAK2-STAT5_pathway_in_clinically_ketotic_cows","319986731_Elevated_Apoptosis_in_the_Liver_of_Dairy_Cows_with_Ketosis","264819584_How_to_cope_with_the_global_value_chain_Lessons_from_Italian_automotive_suppliers","241648574_Why_do_corporate_codes_of_conduct_fail_Women_workers_and_clothing_supply_chains_in_Vietnam","309305782_How_Did_the_Automotive_Component_Suppliers_Cope_with_the_Economic_Crisis_in_Hungary","283200450_Russia's_Global_Value_Chain_Using_Modified_World_Input-Output_Data","6944312_Decreased_Insulin_Response_in_Dairy_Cows_Following_a_Four-Day_Fast_to_Induce_Hepatic_Lipidosis"]}
