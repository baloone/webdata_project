{"id":"330153249_Variations_on_a_Theme_Academic_Integrity_and_Program_Code","abstract":"A recent ITiCSE working group argued the need to explicitly inform students of the academic integrity requirements that apply when they are writing computer programs. The working group proposed a wheel-like diagram that might be used for this purpose and provided some examples to illustrate its use. Three universities in Australia have adopted the principle of informing their students about academic integrity in programming assessments, but have each taken a different approach to doing so. This paper reports on the three different approaches and explains why each was chosen.","authors":["Simon","Trina Myers","Dianna Hardy","Raina Mason"],"meta":["January 2019","DOI:10.1145/3286960.3286967","Conference: the Twenty-First Australasian Computing Education Conference"],"references":["266656939_Student_perceptions_of_the_acceptability_of_various_code-writing_practices","228764242_Educating_students_about_plagiarism_avoidance-A_computer_science_perspective","228603457_Cheating_in_Academic_Institutions_A_Decade_of_Research","322350263_Informing_students_about_academic_integrity_in_programming","313585349_Negotiating_the_Maze_of_Academic_Integrity_in_Computing_Education","257252695_Surveying_the_extent_of_involvement_in_online_academic_dishonesty_e-dishonesty_related_practices_among_university_students_and_the_rationale_students_provide_One_university's_experience"]}
