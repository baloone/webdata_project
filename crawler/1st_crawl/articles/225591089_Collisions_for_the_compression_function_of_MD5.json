{"id":"225591089_Collisions_for_the_compression_function_of_MD5","abstract":"At Cryptoâ€™ 91 Ronald L. Rivest introduced the MD5 Message Digest Algorithm as a strengthened version of MD4, differing from\nit on six points. Four changes are due to the two existing attacks on the two round versions of MD4. The other two changes\nshould additionally strengthen MD5. However both these changes cannot be described as well-considered. One of them results\nin an approximate relation between any four consecutive additive constants. The other allows to create collisions for the\ncompression function of MD5. In this paper an algorithm is described that finds such collisions.\n\nA C program implementing the algorithm establishes a work load of finding about 216 collisions for the first two rounds of the MD5 compression function to find a collision for the entire four round function.\nOn a 33MHz 80386 based PC the mean run time of this program is about 4 minutes.","authors":["Bert den Boer","Antoon Bosselaers"],"meta":["January 1995","DOI:10.1007/3-540-48285-7_26","Conference: Workshop on the theory and application of cryptographic techniques on Advances in cryptology"],"references":["247055658_One-Way_Hash_Functions","242391317_The_MD5_Message-digest_Algorithm","221355169_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","221355081_An_Attack_on_the_Last_Two_Rounds_of_MD4"]}
