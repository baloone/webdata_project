{"id":"353672318_When_catalytic_P_systems_with_one_catalyst_can_be_computationally_complete","abstract":"Catalytic P systems are among the first variants of membrane systems ever considered in this area. This variant of systems also features some prominent computational complexity questions, and in particular the problem of using only one catalyst in the whole system: is one catalyst enough to allow for generating all recursively enumerable sets of multisets? Several additional ingredients have been shown to be sufficient for obtaining computational completeness even with only one catalyst. In this paper, we show that one catalyst is sufficient for obtaining computational completeness if either catalytic rules have weak priority over non-catalytic rules or else instead of the standard maximally parallel derivation mode, we use the derivation mode maxobjects , i.e., we only take those multisets of rules which affect the maximal number of objects in the underlying configuration.","authors":["Artiom Alhazov","Rudolf Freund","Sergiu Ivanov"],"meta":["September 2021Journal of Membrane Computing 3(2)","DOI:10.1007/s41965-021-00079-x"],"references":["265579227_Flattening_in_Tissue_P_Systems","344520881_Regulated_Rewriting_in_Formal_Language_Theory","300111779_On_the_Power_of_Catalytic_P_Systems_with_One_Catalyst","279292707_Catalytic_and_Purely_Catalytic_P_Systems_and_P_Automata_Control_Mechanisms_for_Obtaining_Computational_Completeness","273945962_P_Systems_with_Toxic_Objects","268609752_Membrane_Computing_An_Introduction","268054690_Regulated_rewriting_in_formel_language_theory","234807858_Computation_Finite_and_Infinite_Machines","234780369_The_Oxford_Handbook_of_Membrane_Computing","223827187_Computing_with_membranes_J_Comput_Syst_Sci"]}
