{"id":"353024037_Exploring_the_Potential_of_Machine_Learning_and_Artificial_Intelligence_in_HealthCare","abstract":"Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are the fields of computer science. These are the most explored technologies which are used in various fields to reduce human efforts eg. Healthcare, Education, Retail, etc. Machine Learning is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence. ML and AI are proved for better disease detection, identification, diagnosis, and treatment. People nowadays suffer from a variety of diseases as a result of the climate and their lifestyle choices. There are several records in hospitals which are known as Electronic Health Record. To process that data and to diagnose that disease manually is problematic. To overcome these problems there is a need for some system/technique. To find the solution to these problems ML and AI came into existence. This paper gives an overview of how these two can help in healthcare.","authors":["Kirti Kangra","Jaswinder Singh"],"meta":["July 2021"],"references":["342304511_Detection_of_colon_cancer_based_on_microarray_dataset_using_machine_learning_as_a_feature_selection_and_classification_techniques","338408064_Artificial_Intelligence_in_Healthcare_Review_and_Prediction_Case_Studies","338071772_An_Efficient_Ensemble_Method_for_Cancer_Detection","336849857_Artificial_Intelligence_in_Healthcare","336262852_Application_of_Artificial_Intelligence_in_the_Health_Care_Safety_Context_Opportunities_and_Challenges","336063211_The_Impact_of_Artificial_Intelligence_on_Healthcare","335576533_Chronic_Diseases_Diagnosis_using_Machine_Learning","334845867_Artificial_Intelligent_in_Healthcare","341830115_A_Review_of_Challenges_and_Opportunities_in_Machine_Learning_for_Health","340056254_An_Improved_Support_Vector_Machine_for_Disease_Diagnosis","329083180_Detection_of_Breast_Cancer_with_Mammography_Effect_of_an_Artificial_Intelligence_Support_System","334767998_A_Hybrid_Machine_Learning_Approach_for_Prediction_of_Heart_Diseases","333925310_A_Hybrid_Approach_to_Parkinson_Disease_Classification_Using_Speech_Signal_The_Combination_of_SMOTE_and_Random_Forests","330297524_Opportunities_and_Challenges_for_Artificial_Intelligence_in_India","329982473_Prediction_of_Fatty_Liver_Disease_using_Machine_Learning_Algorithms"]}
