{"id":"280498239_Soft_Skills_and_Software_Development_A_Reflection_from_the_Software_Industry","abstract":"We review the literature relating to soft skills and the software engineering\nand information systems domain before describing a study based on 650 job\nadvertisements posted on well-known recruitment sites from a range of\ngeographical locations including, North America, Europe, Asia and Australia.\nThe study makes use of nine defined soft skills to assess the level of demand\nfor each of these skills related to individual job roles within the software\nindustry. This work reports some of the vital statistics from industry about\nthe requirements of soft skills in various roles of software development\nphases. The work also highlights the variation in the types of skills required\nfor each of the roles. We found that currently although the software industry\nis paying attention to soft skills up to some extent while hiring but there is\na need to further acknowledge the role of these skills in software development.\nThe objective of this paper is to analyze the software industry soft skills\nrequirements for various software development positions, such as system\nanalyst, designer, programmer, and tester. We pose two research questions,\nnamely, (1) What soft skills are appropriate to different software development\nlifecycle roles, and (2) Up to what extend does the software industry consider\nsoft skills when hiring an employee. The study suggests that there is a further\nneed of acknowledgment of the significance of soft skills from employers in\nsoftware industry.","authors":["Faheem Ahmed","Luiz Fernando Capretz","Salah Bouktif","Piers Campbell"],"meta":["July 2015International Journal of Information Processing and Management 4(3)","DOI:10.4156/ijipm.vol14.issue3.17","SourcearXiv"],"references":["297544086_The_relative_importance_of_technical_and_interpersonal_skills_for_new_information_systems_personnel","292371967_Identifying_and_cultivating_exceptional_software_developers","241962133_Understanding_organisational_culture_and_the_implications_for_corporate_marketing","233897090_Belief_attitude_intention_and_behaviour_An_introduction_to_theory_and_research","232557068_Implementing_a_Five-Factor_Personality_Inventory_for_Use_on_the_Internet","226435262_Selecting_Empirical_Methods_for_Software_Engineering_Research","224603875_Guest_Editors'_Introduction_Cooperative_and_Human_Aspects_of_Software_Engineering","224516627_The_Effects_of_Personality_on_Pair_Programming","221644243_Person-job_fit_as_a_moderator_of_the_relationship_between_emotional_intelligence_and_job_performance","220591483_Person-Job_Cognitive_Style_Fit_for_Software_Developers_The_Effect_on_Strain_and_Performance","220591455_Relationships_Between_Job_Skills_and_Performance_A_Study_of_Webmasters","220437144_Traits_of_top_performing_software_developers","220420154_Practical_intelligence_in_IT_assessing_soft_skills_of_IT_professionals","220260197_The_IS_Expectation_Gap_Industry_Expectations_Versus_Academic_Preparation","200085947_Towards_individualized_software_engineering_Empirical_studies_should_collect_psychometrics","28763874_Ethical_Issues_in_Empirical_Studies_of_Software_Engineering","344867507_Managing_Psychological_Factors_in_Information_Systems_Work_An_Orientation_to_Emotional_Intelligence","313302247_Culture_as_social_control_Corporations_cults_and_commitment","289884867_Entry-level_IS_job_skills_A_survey_of_employers","289471138_The_paradox_of_soft_skills_versus_technical_skills_in_IS_hiring","277473765_Practical_intelligence_in_IT","276012601_The_risk_analysis_of_software_projects_based_on_Bayesian_Network","273798761_Operations_of_IT_Projects_with_Balanced_Exploitative_and_Exploratory_Activities","264799709_The_Psychology_Of_Computer_Programming","262347165_Perceived_Importance_of_Systems_Analysts'_Job_Skills_Roles_and_Non-Salary_Incentives","260305757_Evaluating_the_Demand_for_Soft_Skills_in_Software_Development","256474867_Soft_Skills_and_Software_Development_A_Reflection_from_Software_Industry","250729020_Cognitive_style_personality_and_computer_programming","249001198_Winning_hearts_and_minds_-_Emotional_labour_and_learning_for_care_management_work","246494986_Belief_Attitude_Intention_and_Behavior_An_Introduction_to_Theory_and_Research","244450109_A_Theory_of_Individual_Difference_in_Task_and_Contextual_Performance","242500466_The_is_expectation_gap_industry_expectations_venus_academic_preparation","238974171_The_missing_context_of_information_technology_personnel_a_review_and_future_directions_for_research","235720516_Corporate_Culture_and_Performance","234799166_Are_technical_and_soft_skills_required_The_use_of_structural_equation_modeling_to_examine_factors_leading_to_retention_in_the_cs_major","233896295_Emotional_Intelligence","232598225_The_Intelligence_of_Emotional_Intelligence","232471613_Practical_Intelligence_in_Real-World_Pursuits_The_Role_of_Tacit_Knowledge","232430526_Modeling_the_performance_prediction_problem_in_industrial_and_organizational_psychology","229741237_An_Exploratory_Analysis_of_the_Value_of_the_Skills_of_IT_Personnel_Their_Relationship_to_IS_Infrastructure_and_Competitive_Advantage","222881813_Personality-job_fit_Implications_for_Individual_Attitudes_and_Performance","222526030_Personality_types_in_software_engineering","220653099_MIS_professionals_Education_and_performance","220631650_Why_do_we_need_personality_diversity_in_software_engineering","220591600_MIS_skills_for_the_1990s_A_survey_of_MIS_managers'_perceptions","220386282_Making_Sense_of_Software_Development_and_Personality_Types","200086168_Software_psychology_Human_factors_in_computer_and_information_systems_Winthrop_computer_systems_series","200085860_Competencies_of_exceptional_and_nonexceptional_software_engineers","43476145_Women_information_technology_and_waves_of_optimism_Australian_evidence_on_mixed-skill_jobs","31663692_Introduction_to_System_Analysis_and_Design_A_Structured_Approach_PA_Kendall","10702140_A_Personality_Trait-Based_Interactionist_Model_of_Job_Performance","20871670_An_Alternative_Description_of_Personality_The_Big-Five_Factor_Structure","11770388_Emotional_Intelligence_and_Interpersonal_Relations","6613216_Using_ethnographic_methods_to_carry_out_human_factors_research_in_software_engineering","3248351_Emphasizing_Human_Capabilities_in_Software_Development"]}
