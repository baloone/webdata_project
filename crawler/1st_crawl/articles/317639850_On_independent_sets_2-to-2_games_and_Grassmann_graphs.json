{"id":"317639850_On_independent_sets_2-to-2_games_and_Grassmann_graphs","abstract":"We present a candidate reduction from the 3-Lin problem to the 2-to-2 Games problem and present a combinatorial hypothesis about Grassmann graphs which, if correct, is sufficient to show the soundness of the reduction in a certain non-standard sense. A reduction that is sound in this non-standard sense implies that it is NP-hard to distinguish whether an n-vertex graph has an independent set of size ( 1â 1/â2 ) n â o(n) or whether every independent set has size o(n), and consequently, that it is NP-hard to approximate the Vertex Cover problem within a factor â2âo(1).","authors":["Subhash Khot","Dor Minzer","Muli Safra"],"meta":["June 2017","DOI:10.1145/3055399.3055432","Conference: the 49th Annual ACM SIGACT Symposium"],"references":["234794393_Proof_Verification_and_the_Hardness_of_Approximation_Problems","234783217_Interactive_proofs_and_the_hardness_of_approximating_cliques","220616954_Free_Bits_PCPs_and_Nonapproximability-Towards_Tight_Results","220137845_A_Better_Approximation_Ratio_for_the_Vertex_Cover_Problem","307876047_Approximation_Resistance_from_Pairwise-Independent_Subgroups","268606821_Bounds_for_codes_in_the_case_of_list_decoding_of_finite_volume","262170383_Approximation_resistance_from_pairwise_independent_subgroups","262161078_Parallel_repetition_Simplifications_and_the_no-signaling_case","251351298_Clique_is_hard_to_approximate_within","248321322_Vertex_Cover_Might_be_Hard_to_Approximate_to_within_2","247665552_SUBA_parallel_repetition_theorem","247587945_Some_optimal_inapproximabiity_results","239443800_Bounds_for_codes_in_the_case_of_list_decoding_of_lunite_volume","236661612_Analytical_Approach_to_Parallel_Repetition","232619366_Clique_is_hard_to_approximate_within_n1_-_E","228659739_Inapproximability_of_NP-complete_Problems_Discrete_Fourier_Analysis_and_Geometry","228057642_Probabilistic_checking_of_proofs_A_new_characterization_of_NP","224266343_A_Two_Prover_One_Round_Game_with_Strong_Soundness","222726456_Vertex_cover_might_be_hard_to_approximate_to_within","222302733_Shadows_and_intersections_in_vector_spaces","222257702_The_Hardness_of_Approximate_Optima_in_Lattices_Codes_and_Systems_of_Linear_Equations","221591442_A_Sub-Constant_Error-Probability_Low-Degree_Test_and_a_Sub-Constant_Error-Probability_PCP_Characterization_of_NP","221591006_The_PCP_theorem_by_gap_amplification","221580532_On_the_Unique_Games_Conjecture_Invited_Survey","220617401_Ruling_Out_PTAS_for_Graph_Min-Bisection_Dense_k-Subgraph_and_Bipartite_Clique","220138429_Parallel_Repetition_in_Projection_Games_and_a_Concentration_Bound","220138232_The_PCP_theorem_by_gap_amplification","4186670_On_the_unique_games_conjecture","3948668_On_the_power_of_unique_2-prover_1-round_games","3921088_Improved_inapproximability_results_for_MaxClique_chromatic_number_and_approximate_graph_coloring","2902436_On_the_Hardness_of_Approximating_Minimum_Vertex_Cover","2597037_Hardness_of_Approximate_Hypergraph_Coloring","2537819_Robust_Characterizations_of_Polynomials_with_Applications_to_Program_Testing","2388029_Improved_Approximation_Algorithms_for_the_Vertex_Cover_Problem_in_Graphs_and_Hypergraphs"]}
