{"id":"221344668_Learning_Recurrent_Neural_Networks_with_Hessian-Free_Optimization","abstract":"In this work we resolve the long-outstanding problem of how to effectively train recurrent neural networks (RNNs) on complex and difficult sequence modeling problems which may contain long-term data dependencies. Utilizing recent advances in the Hessian-free optimization approach (Martens, 2010), together with a novel damping scheme, we successfully train RNNs on two sets of challenging problems. First, a collection of pathological synthetic datasets which are known to be impossible for standard optimization approaches (due to their extremely long-term dependencies), and second, on three natural and highly complex real-world sequence datasets where we find that our method significantly outperforms the previous state-of-theart method for training neural sequence models: the Long Short-term Memory approach of Hochreiter and Schmidhuber (1997). Additionally, we offer a new interpretation of the generalized Gauss-Newton matrix of Schraudolph (2002) which is used within the HF approach of Martens. 1.","authors":["James Martens","Ilya Sutskever"],"meta":["January 2011","SourceDBLP","Conference: Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Machine Learning, ICML 2011, Bellevue, Washington, USA, June 28 - July 2, 2011"],"references":["277298117_Bridging_Long_Time_Lags_by_Weight_Guessing_and_Long_Short_Term_Memory","243781690_Untersuchungen_zu_dynamischen_neuronalen_Netzen","224685591_A_System_for_Robotic_Heart_Surgery_that_Learns_to_Tie_Knots_Using_Recurrent_Neural_Networks","221620610_Offline_Arabic_Handwriting_Recognition_with_Multidimensional_Recurrent_Neural_Networks","13853244_Long_Short-term_Memory","12292425_Learning_to_Forget_Continual_Prediction_with_LSTM","11294744_Fast_Curvature_Matrix-Vector_Products_for_Second-Order_Gradient_Descent","5583935_Learning_long-term_dependencies_with_gradient_descent_is_difficult","2822332_Fast_Exact_Multiplication_by_the_Hessian","285906939_Numerical_optimization","229091480_Learning_Representations_by_Back_Propagating_Errors","221345102_Deep_learning_via_Hessian-free_optimization","215721980_Dynamic_Bayesian_Networks_Representation_Inference_and_Learning","8638014_Harnessing_Nonlinearity_Predicting_Chaotic_Systems_and_Saving_Energy_in_Wireless_Communication","7647316_Framewise_phoneme_classification_with_bidirectional_LSTM_and_other_neural_network_architectures","6912170_Reducing_the_Dimensionality_of_Data_with_Neural_Networks"]}
