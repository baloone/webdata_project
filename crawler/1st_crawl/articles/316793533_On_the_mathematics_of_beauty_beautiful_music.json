{"id":"316793533_On_the_mathematics_of_beauty_beautiful_music","abstract":"The question of beauty has inspired scientists and philosophers for centuries, the study of aesthetics today became an active research area in fields as diverse as neuroscience, psychology, and computer science. In this letter, we will study the simplest kind of beauty that can be found in a simple piece of music and can be appreciated universally. The proposed model suggest that there is a link between beautiful music and the Dyson distribution which seems to be the result of a deeper optimisation process between randomness and regularity. Then we show that beautiful music need to satisfy a more fundamental law that seeks to deliver the highest amount of information using the least amount of energy. The proposed model is tested on a set of beautiful music pieces.","authors":["A. M.
