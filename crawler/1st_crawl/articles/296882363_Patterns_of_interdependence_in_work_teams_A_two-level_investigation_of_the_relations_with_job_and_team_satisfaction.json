{"id":"296882363_Patterns_of_interdependence_in_work_teams_A_two-level_investigation_of_the_relations_with_job_and_team_satisfaction","abstract":"A questionnaire study in 17 school and 24 engineering teams examined affective reactions to task and goal interdependence at the group and individual level of analysis. Group-level task interdependence was positively related to group members' job and team satisfaction. Within-group differences in the degree of task interdependence were unrelated to affective responses. Interactions revealed that within-group task interdependence is positively related to both job and team satisfaction only if the degree of goal interdependence in the work team is high.","authors":["GS Van der Vegt","BJM Emans","E Van de Vliert"],"meta":["March 2001Personnel Psychology 54(1):51-69"],"references":["247716754_A_Typology_for_Integrating_Technology_Organization_and_Job_Design","232584592_Effects_of_Goals_and_Feedback_on_Performance_in_Groups","232494518_Estimating_Within-Group_Interrater_Reliability_With_and_Without_Response_Bias","232418125_The_Relationship_Between_Satisfaction_Attitudes_and_Performance_An_Organizational_Level_Analysis","19356291_The_Moderator-Mediator_Variable_Distinction_in_Social_Psychological_Research","13062580_The_Impact_of_a_Change_in_Technology_on_Job_Characteristics_A_Quasi-_Experiment","280291158_Group_productivity_and_process_Pure_and_mixed_reward_structures_and_task_interdependence","278972675_Task_Interdependence_and_Extrarole_Behavior_A_Test_of_the_Mediating_Effects_of_Felt_Responsibility","272562324_The_Analysis_of_Goals_in_Complex_Organizations","272550279_Organization_Technology_and_Organization_Structure","271752192_Interdependence_Differential_Rewarding_and_Productivity","271688757_Self-Regulating_Work_Groups_A_Socio-Technical_Synthesis","247738031_Power_and_Interdependence_in_Work_GroupsViews_of_Managers_and_Employees","246501565_Erratum_Interdependence_and_Group_Effectiveness","246024362_Effects_of_Facilitative_Role_Interdependence_on_Group_Functioning","245041845_A_Review_of_the_Influence_of_Group_Goals_on_Group_Performance","238986476_A_Model_of_Task_Group_Effectiveness","232532989_Effects_of_Group_Feedback_Goal_Setting_and_Incentives_on_Organizational_Productivity","227805935_Relations_Between_Work_Group_Characteristics_and_Effectiveness_Implications_for_Designing_Effective_Work_Groups","227613901_Relations_between_work_team_characteristics_and_effectiveness_A_replication_and_extension","223314789_Technology_and_the_structuring_of_jobs_Employee_satisfaction_performance_and_influence","23130871_Corneal_infections_author's_transl","13038303_Task_interdependence_and_job_design_Test_of_a_theory"]}
