{"id":"335845060_Structure_Connectivity_and_Substructure_Connectivity_of_k-Ary_n-Cube_Networks","abstract":"We present new results on the fault tolerability of k-ary n-cube (denoted Qk n) networks. Qk n is a topological model for interconnection networks that has been extensively studied since proposed, and this paper is concerned with the structure/substructure connectivity of Qk n networks, for paths and cycles, two basic yet important network structures. Let G be a connected graph and T a connected subgraph of G. The T-structure connectivity k(G;T) of G is the cardinality of a minimum set of subgraphs in G, such that each subgraph is isomorphic to T, and the set’s removal disconnects G. The T-substructure connectivity k8(G;T) of G is the cardinality of a minimum set of subgraphs in G, such that each subgraph is isomorphic to a connected subgraph of T, and the set’s removal disconnects G. In this paper, we study k(Qk n;T) and k(Qk n;T) for T = Pi, a path on i nodes (resp. T = Ci, a cycle on i nodes). In [11], k(Qk n;T) and k8(Qk n;T) were determined for T ∈ {P1,P2,P3}. Our results generalize the preceding results by determining k(Qk n;Pi) and k8(Qk n;Pi). In addition, we have also established k(Qk n;Ci) and k8(Qkn;Ci).","authors":["Guozhen Zhang","Dajin Wang"],"meta":["September 2019IEEE Access PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2941711"],"references":["345489744_Structure_Fault-Tolerance_of_the_Generalized_Hypercube","330827220_Path_and_cycle_fault_tolerance_of_bubble-sort_graph_networks","325479145_The_g-extra_connectivity_and_diagnosability_of_crossed_cubes","322809342_The_Relationship_Between_g_-Restricted_Connectivity_and_g_-Good-Neighbor_Fault_Diagnosability_of_General_Regular_Networks","321933754_Structure_connectivity_and_substructure_connectivity_of_k_-ary_n_-cube_networks","320845746_Structure_fault_tolerance_of_hypercubes_and_folded_hypercubes","313096600_Equal_relation_between_the_extra_connectivity_and_pessimistic_diagnosability_for_some_regular_graphs","301307738_Structure_connectivity_and_substructure_connectivity_of_hypercubes","290477036_Relating_the_extra_connectivity_and_the_conditional_diagnosability_of_regular_graphs_under_the_comparison_model","287148222_23-Restricted_Connectivity_of_Locally_Twisted_Cubes"]}
