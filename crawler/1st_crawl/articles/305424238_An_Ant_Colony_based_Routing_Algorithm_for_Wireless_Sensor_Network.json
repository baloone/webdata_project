{"id":"305424238_An_Ant_Colony_based_Routing_Algorithm_for_Wireless_Sensor_Network","abstract":"Wireless sensor network (WSN) is a new research area of computer science and technology and has a wide application future, more and more attention. It will be much market in application of military, health, home, environment, etc. In WSN, sensor devices have limited supply of energy. The sensor death due to dissipating battery energy is one of the fundamental design issues in WSNs. Hence, energy efficiency is argued to be the most important requirement for WSN. Aiming at the limitation of energy of wireless sensor network node, this paper presents a routing algorithm which is based on the antâ€™s capability of finding the best paths between a food source and their nests. The pheromone and the energy of the node and delay of the node were combined to affect the pheromone concentration in optimization. Simulation results show that it can balance energy consumption between nodes and prolong the lifecycle of the whole network.","authors":["Xiaodong Liu","Songyang Li","Miao Wang"],"meta":["June 2016International Journal of Future Generation Communication and Networking 9(6):75-86","DOI:10.14257/ijfgcn.2016.9.6.08"],"references":[]}
