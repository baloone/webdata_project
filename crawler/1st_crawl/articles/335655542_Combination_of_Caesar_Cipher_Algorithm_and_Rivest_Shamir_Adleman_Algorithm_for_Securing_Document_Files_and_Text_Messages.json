Data security is very important to maintain the important data content of the parties that can harm by destroying important data from the data owner. By improving data security, using a combination of algorithms, it can keep data security more secure than attacks that can harm the content of stored data, especially data in the form of document files and text messaging. The combination of algorithms used for data security used is caesare cipher algorithm and RSA algorithm. So by using a combination of caesar cipher algotitm and RSA algorithm, the security level of document files and text messages can be more awake the authenticity of the data.","authors":["Indra Gunawan","Sumarno Sumarno","Heru Satria Tambunan","Eka Irawan"],"meta":["August 2019Journal of Physics Conference Series 1255(1):012077","DOI:10.1088/1742-6596/1255/1/012077"],"references":["329486415_An_introduction_to_cryptography_second_edition","267003545_Understanding_cryptography_A_textbook_for_students_and_practitioners_Foreword_by_Bart_Preneel","220690171_Understanding_Cryptography_A_Textbook_for_Students_and_Practitioners","220688729_Introduction_to_Modern_Cryptography"]}
