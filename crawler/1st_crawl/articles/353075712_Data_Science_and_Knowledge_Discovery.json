{"id":"353075712_Data_Science_and_Knowledge_Discovery","abstract":"Nowadays, Data Science (DS) is gaining a relevant impact on the community. The most recent developments in Computer Science, such as advances in Machine and Deep Learning, Big Data, Knowledge Discovery, and Data Analytics, have triggered the development of several innovative solutions (e.g., approaches, methods, models, or paradigms). It is a trending topic with many application possibilities and motivates the researcher to conduct experiments in these most diverse areas. This issue created an opportunity to expose some of the most relevant achievements in the Knowledge Discovery and Data Science field and contribute to such subjects as Health, Smart Homes, Social Humanities, Government, among others. The relevance of this field can be easily observed by its current achieved numbers: thirteen research articles, one technical note, and forty-six authors from fifteen nationalities.","authors":["Filipe Portela"],"meta":["July 2021Future Internet 13(7):178","DOI:10.3390/fi13070178"],"references":["351009047_Pervasive_Intelligent_Models_to_Predict_the_Outcome_of_COVID-19_Patients","349656824_Adapting_Data-Driven_Research_to_the_Fields_of_Social_Sciences_and_the_Humanities","349259701_Dashboard_COMPRIME_COMPRI_MOv_Multiscalar_Spatio-Temporal_Monitoring_of_the_COVID-19_Pandemic_in_Portugal","348032498_Authorship_Identification_of_a_Russian-Language_Text_Using_Support_Vector_Machine_and_Deep_Neural_Networks","347853337_A_Data_Augmentation_Approach_to_Distracted_Driving_Detection","347460226_Role_of_Artificial_Intelligence_in_Shaping_Consumer_Demand_in_E-Commerce","347221056_Predicting_Activities_of_Daily_Living_with_Spatio-Temporal_Information","346998849_Geospatial_Assessment_of_the_Territorial_Road_Network_by_Fractal_Method","346574940_Monitoring_and_Support_for_Elderly_People_Using_LoRa_Communication_Technologies_IoT_Concepts_and_Applications","346528922_About_Rule-Based_Systems_Single_Database_Queries_for_Decision_Making"]}
