{"id":"296872898_Challenges_in_providing_unpublished_research_data_in_biomedical_engineering_to_grey_literature_repositories","abstract":"Regardless of the scientific field or focus, every researcher produces a multitude of unpublished research data during his or her career, including project diaries, project proposals, laboratory notes, and also the outputs of collaboration between researchers—for example, images, video, and measurements. Such “ephemeral” data can be crucial in inspiring new research directions and perspectives, and is often currently not shared in open repositories, although making such data more accessible undoubtedly has value for researchers. While not “literature” according to the traditional definition, such contextual materials and data—at least in bioengineering and biophysics—are the de facto bases for any grey literature produced in such fields and are directly relevant when discussing the utility of a grey literature repository in relation to such research endeavors. In this paper, the authors describe the difficulties posed in searching for grey literature and data on a specific bioengineering topic, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of lung structures using the Magnetization Transfer Contrast method, and also provide examples of unindexed grey literature and data produced by scholars in this field.","authors":["Pavla Francová","Stephanie Krueger"],"meta":["January 2016"],"references":["304117052_Beyond_the_Paywall_A_Multi-Sited_Ethnographic_Examination_of_the_Information-Related_Behaviors_of_Six_Scientists","282288174_Prospective_evaluation_of_liver_steatosis-comparison_of_stereological_point-counting_of_biopsies_with_1HMRS","271712414_OSL_Platform_A_Link_to_Open-access_Scientific_Information_and_Structured_Data","257552426_Supporting_Scientific_Collaboration_Methods_Tools_and_Concepts","49175975_Shedding_Light_on_the_Dark_Data_in_the_Long_Tail_of_Science"]}
