{"id":"237676103_El_rol_de_las_predicaciones_verbales_en_la_extraccion_automatica_de_conceptos","abstract":"In specialised texts, there are some recurrent typographical and syntactic patterns that authors use to define a term. Some of these syntactic patterns are verbal predications that function as connectors between terms and definitions. In this paper we analyse the role of the verbal predications involved in definitional contexts of specialised texts in Spanish, in order to develop a system capable of extracting definitional contexts.","authors":["Rodrigo Alarc√≥n","Gerardo Sierra"],"meta":[],"references":["278730516_Extracting_knowledge-rich_contexts_for_terminography","221629124_Automatic_Extraction_of_Non-standard_Lexical_Data_for_a_Metalinguistic_Information_Database"]}
