{"id":"275543298_Sex_Differences_in_Mathematics_Motivation_in_8th_and_9th_Grade","abstract":"Academic motivation is a topic of a great relevance in Secondary Education. This research aims to examine the gender differences in motivation in the area of mathematics in 8th and 9th grade, that is, in the transition from Middle School to Junior High School. The research has been conducted in different schools located in the Basque Country (Spain) and collects data from 403 students (8th and 9th graders) using the expectancy-value motivational model which has been adapted for application in mathematics. The findings show statistically significant differences in 8th grade in self-efficacy, where men score higher, whereas no there are differences in either value or cost. Motivational differences are not given in any scale in 9th grade.","authors":["Javier Gasco-Txabarri","Alfredo Go√±i","Jose Domingo Villarroel"],"meta":["February 2014Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences 116","DOI:10.1016/j.sbspro.2014.01.340"],"references":["281345525_Motivational_Beliefs_Values_and_Goals","271429287_A_Manual_for_the_Use_of_the_Motivated_Strategies_for_Learning_Questionnaire_MSLQ","316807278_Intrinsic_Motivation_and_Self-Determination_in_Human_Behavior","292100931_Gender_Differences_in_Mathematics_An_Integrative_Psychological_Approach","285944051_Cognitive_and_motivational_variables_in_the_academic_achievement_in_language_and_mathematics_subjects_A_structural_model","271347990_Fennema-Sherman_Mathematics_Attitudes_Scales_Instruments_Designed_to_Measure_Attitudes_toward_the_Learning_of_Mathematics_by_Females_and_Males","250185042_The_Role_of_Classroom_Goal_Structure_in_Students'_Use_of_Self-Handicapping_Strategies","248497711_Motivation_and_students'_use_of_learning_strategies_Evidence_of_unidirectional_effects_in_mathematics_classrooms","247246484_Intellective_variables_and_mathematics_achievement_Directions_for_research","243767206_Motivation_in_education_Theory"]}
