These are instances of what Stuart Shapiro [215] calls the philosophy of X disciplines, and any philosophical investigation of such subjects must begin with some discussion of the discipline itself. In particular, it must aim to expose its subject matter, uncover its core activities, and draw out its distinctive features.","authors":["Raymond Turner"],"meta":["July 2018","DOI:10.1007/978-3-662-55565-1_1","In book: Computational Artifacts (pp.5-11)","Project: philosophy of computer science"],"references":[]}
