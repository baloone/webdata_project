{"id":"270071663_A_robust_optical_flow_estimation_technique_using_gradient_orientations","abstract":"The gradient method is a classical technique for calculating optical flows in image sequences. In spite of its serious limitations, including the extreme sensitivity to changing illuminations, it is still popular and widely used in various image processing and computer vision applications because of its efficiency in computation. We previously proposed an improved version of the gradient method based on gradient orientations instead of intensities. Since gradient orientations are known to be stable to global changes of intensities, the proposed technique can perform optical flow estimation regardless of irregular lighting. We refer to this method the gradient orientation based gradient method (GOGM). This paper is a further study of the GOGM. New simulation and experimental results show that this technique works at a video rate of 16 Hz and outperforms the traditional gradient method where the aperture problem and illumination changes are involved.","authors":["Pramuk Boonsieng","Toshiaki Kondo","Waree Kongprawechnon"],"meta":["February 2014ScienceAsia 40(1):73","DOI:10.2306/scienceasia1513-1874.2014.40.073"],"references":["228706458_Robust_motion_estimation_methods_using_gradient_orientation_information","226516316_A_Database_and_Evaluation_Methodology_for_Optical_Flow","292796591_Learning_OpenCV_Computer_vision_with_OpenCV_library","289542614_Unit_gradient_vectors_based_motion_estimation_techniques","268992620_Digital_Image_Sequence_Processing_Compression_and_Analysis","252322149_Digital_image_sequence_processing_compression_and_analysis","228083880_An_Iterative_Image_Registration_Technique_with_an_Application_toStereo_Vision","224378013_Optical_Flow_Estimation_An_Error_Analysis_of_Gradient-Based_Methods_with_Local_Optimization","224341905_Improved_gradient-based_methods_for_motion_estimation_in_image_sequences","223839586_Motion_estimation_based_on_the_direction_of_intensity_gradient"]}
