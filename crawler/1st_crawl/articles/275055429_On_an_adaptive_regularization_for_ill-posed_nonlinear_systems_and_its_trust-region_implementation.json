We show that an appropriate choice of the\ntrust-region radius gives rise to a procedure that has the potential to\napproach a solution of the unperturbed system. This regularizing property is\nshown theoretically and validated numerically.","authors":["Stefania Bellavia","Benedetta Morini","Elisa Riccietti"],"meta":["May 2016Computational Optimization and Applications 64(1)","DOI:10.1007/s10589-015-9806-9","SourcearXiv"],"references":["260399814_On_the_Regularity_of_a_Trust_Region-CG_Algorithm_for_Nonlinear_Ill-posed_Inverse_Problems","249011466_A_new_trust_region_algorithm_with_trust_region_radius_converging_to_zero","324315437_Elements_of_Numerical_Analysis","312230773_A_method_for_the_solution_of_certain_nonlinear_problems_in_least_squares","284901604_The_Levenberg-Marquardt_Algorithm_Implementation_and_Theory","284071777_Choice_of_parameter_for_the_solution_of_functional_equations_by_the_regularization_method","277611623_Strong_local_convergence_properties_of_adaptive_regularized_methods_for_nonlinear_least_squares","265368224_Elements_of_Numerical_Analysis","254252761_Nonlinear_stepsize_control_trust_regions_and_regularizations_for_unconstrained_optimization","246567647_Iterative_Regularization_Methods_for_Nonlinear_Ill-Posed_Problems"]}
