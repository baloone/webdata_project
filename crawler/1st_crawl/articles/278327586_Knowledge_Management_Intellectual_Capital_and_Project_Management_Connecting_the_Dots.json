{"id":"278327586_Knowledge_Management_Intellectual_Capital_and_Project_Management_Connecting_the_Dots","abstract":"Traditionally, the fields of knowledge management (KM), intellectual capital (IC) and project management (PM) have been studied separately. More recently, scholars have started to call for convergence between these disciplines in order to broaden research interests and opportunities in academia and enhance their value to practice. Following the current trend, the purpose of this paper is to propose a new conceptual model that merges elements of knowledge management (KM), intellectual capital (IC) and project management (PM) and thus connects dynamic (KM), static (IC) and performance (PM) aspects of project-based organisations. It is expected that the proposed model will serve as a valuable theoretical basis for future empirical research of modern knowledge organisations.","authors":["Meliha Handzic","Nermina Durmic"],"meta":["June 2015","Project: Knowledge and Project Management"],"references":["292714014_The_Resource-Based_Theory_of_Competitive_Advantage_Implications_for_Strategy_Formulation","276935590_A_Resource_Based_Theory_of_Competitive_Advantage","266403477_Knowledge_Management_An_Integrative_Approach","337532982_Management_d'un_projet_systeme_d'information_principes_techniques_mise_en_oeuvre_et_outils","319394274_Working_Knowledge","314501472_Integrating_Knowledge_Management_with_Programme_Management","313082025_Knowledge_management_and_knowledge_management_systems_conceptual_foundations_and_research_issues","303048765_Evolving_a_New_Software_Development_Life_Cycle_Model_SDLC-2013_with_Client_Satisfaction","269559928_Integrating_Knowledge_Management_with_Programme_Management","266673971_The_Search_for_an_Integrated_KM_Framework"]}
