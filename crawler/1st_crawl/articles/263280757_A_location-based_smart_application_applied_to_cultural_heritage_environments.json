{"id":"263280757_A_location-based_smart_application_applied_to_cultural_heritage_environments","abstract":"In this paper, we present a Location-based application de-veloped within DATABENC, a high technology district for Cultural Her-itage management. In particular, the project aims at exploiting several location-based services and technologies in order to realize a smart multi-media guide system. This system is able to detect the closest artworks to an user, make these artworks able to tweet and talk during users visit and capable of automatically telling their stories using multimedia facilities. Several experiments are performend in our laboratory by means of the installation of some sensors that, using Wi-Fi technology, allow the users mobile devices to detect the closest artwork as in a museum environment. The cultural items detection was performed by a localization algorithm designed and tested in our laboratory environment. As case of study, we show an example of tweeting and talking artworks as a location-based application of a sculptures art exhibition within the Maschio Angioino castle, in Naples -Italy.","authors":["Angelo Chianese","Vincenzo Moscato","Francesco Piccialli","Isabella Valente"],"meta":["June 2014","Conference: SEBD 2014 - 22 Italian Symposium on Advanced Database SystemsAt: Sorrento Coast"],"references":["271920222_Recommending_multimedia_visiting_paths_in_cultural_heritage_applications","267975777_A_Framework_of_a_Personalized_Location-based_Traveler_Recommendation_System_in_Mobile_Application","261510213_A_smart_multimedia_guide_for_indoor_contextual_navigation_in_Cultural_Heritage_applications","260024357_A_Novel_Challenge_into_Multimedia_Cultural_Heritage_An_Integrated_Approach_to_Support_Cultural_Information_Enrichment","260024277_SmARTweet_A_Location-Based_Smart_Application_for_Exhibits_and_Museums","258207472_The_Talking_Museum_Project","252132860_Generating_Multilingual_Descriptions_from_Linguistically_Annotated_OWL_Ontologies_the_NaturalOWL_System","268253904_A_Study_on_the_Mobile_Communication_Network_with_Smart_Phone_for_Building_of_Location_Based_Real_Time_Reservation_System","266653006_SNOPS_A_smart_environment_for_cultural_heritage_applications","260633914_An_Indoor_Localization_Mechanism_Based_on_RFID_and_IR_Data_in_Ambient_Intelligent_Environments","237088905_Towards_a_user_based_recommendation_strategy_for_digital_ecosystems","234820498_Sotto_Voce_Exploring_the_Interplay_of_Conversation_and_Mobile_Audio_Spaces","228339131_Intelligent_User_Profiling","242462942_Stereotypes_and_User_Modeling","236163673_Device-Free_Indoor_Localization_for_AAL_Applications"]}
