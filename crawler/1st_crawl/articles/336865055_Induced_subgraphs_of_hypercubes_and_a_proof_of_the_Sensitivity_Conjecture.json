{"id":"336865055_Induced_subgraphs_of_hypercubes_and_a_proof_of_the_Sensitivity_Conjecture","abstract":"In this paper, we show that every (2n-1 + 1)-vertex induced subgraph of the n-dimensional cube graph has maximum degree at least n. This is the best possible result, and it improves a logarithmic lower bound shown by Chung, FÃ¼redi, Graham and Seymour in 1988. As a direct consequence, we prove that the sensitivity and degree of a boolean function are polynomially related, solving an outstanding foundational problem in theoretical computer science, the Sensitivity Conjecture of Nisan and Szegedy.","authors":["Huang"],"meta":["November 2019Annals of Mathematics 190(3):949","DOI:10.4007/annals.2019.190.3.6"],"references":[]}
