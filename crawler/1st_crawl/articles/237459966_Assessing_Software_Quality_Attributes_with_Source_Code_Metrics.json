Foremost, I would like to thank Martin Pinzger and Patrick Knab for their help during the last six months. Also special thanks to Co for her patience during the hairy days and my fellow students Michi and Roman for power infusions during downtimes. Last but not least I would like to thank Marcel for proof-reading my work and my parents for their never ending trust. This thesis is about quality assessment of software systems by using source code metrics. We define four dimensions and relate them to a number of popular quality models, i.e., the models of McCall, Boehm, ISO 9126, Dromey and Bansiya. We also relate source code metric based quality models (SMQM) to these dimensions and show that the usefulness of SMQM is limited to an architectural view. But from this point of view, it is an expressive tool to assess software. We discuss several aspects of source code measuring. The objective and subjective viewpoint are contrasted whereas the former is more an engineering approach and the latter is more an","authors":["Andreas Jetter","Martin Pinzger","Patrick Knab"],"meta":["January 2006"],"references":["220092347_Status_Report_on_Software_Measurement","3187784_Towards_a_Framework_for_Software_Measurement_Validation","3187649_Kemerer_CF_A_metric_suite_for_object_oriented_design_IEEE_Trans_Softw_Eng_206_476-493","305296096_Towards_a_Metrics_Suite_for_Object_Oriented_Design","294293006_Software_development_the_agile_way","260649166_The_TAME_Project_Towards_Improvement-Oriented_Software_Environments","248809571_Object_-_oriented_met_-_rics_measures_of_complexity","246987586_Object-Oriented_Metrics_Measures_of_Complexity","243716177_What_does_Product_Quality_really_mean_Sloan_Management_Review","238673862_Factors_in_Software_Quality","235978110_Characteristics_of_Software_Quality","234798467_Object-Oriented_Design_Heuristics","220093238_Software_Quality_The_Elusive_Target","4704648_A_Validation_of_Object-Oriented_Design_Metrics","3189025_A_Complexity_Measure","3188003_Davis_C_A_Hierarchical_Model_for_Object-Oriented_Design_Quality_Assessment_IEEE_Transactions_on_Software_Engineering_28_4-17","3187827_A_Validation_of_Object-Oriented_Design_Metrics_as_Quality_Indicators","3187692_A_Model_for_Software_Product_Quality","3187466_Methodology_for_Validating_Software_Metrics"]}
