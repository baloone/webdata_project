{"id":"312669191_Fabrication_and_optimisation_of_a_fused_filament_3D-printed_microfluidic_platform","abstract":"A 3D-printed microfluidic device was designed and manufactured using a low cost ($2000) consumer grade fusion deposition modelling (FDM) 3D printer. FDM printers are not typically used, or are capable, of producing the fine detailed structures required for microfluidic fabrication. However, in this work, the optical transparency of the device was improved through manufacture optimisation to such a point that optical colorimetric assays can be performed in a 50 l device. A colorimetric enzymatic cascade assay was optimised using glucose oxidase and horseradish peroxidase for the oxidative coupling of aminoantipyrine and chromotropic acid to produce a blue quinoneimine dye with a broad absorbance peaking at 590 nm for the quantification of glucose in solution. For comparison the assay was run in standard 96 well plates with a commercial plate reader. The results show the accurate and reproducible quantification of 0-10 mM glucose solution using a 3D-printed microfluidic optical device with performance comparable to that of a plate reader assay.","authors":["Alexander Tothill","M Partridge","Stephen W James","Ralph P Tatam"],"meta":["January 2017Journal of Micromechanics and Microengineering 27(3)","DOI:10.1088/1361-6439/aa5ae3"],"references":["301915424_Microfluidic-Integrated_DNA_Nanobiosensors","299655378_The_upcoming_3D-printing_revolution_in_microfluidics","275998569_Crystallization_of_Amorphous_PolyLactic_Acid_Induced_by_Vapor_of_Acetone_to_Form_High_Crystallinity_and_Transparency_Specimen","261035102_3D-printed_fluidic_devices_enable_quantitative_evaluation_of_blood_components_in_modified_storage_solutions_for_use_in_transfusion_medicine","306157767_An_optical_method_for_evaluation_of_geometric_fidelity_for_anatomically_shaped_tissue_engineered_constructs","293653507_3D-printed_fluidic_devices_enable_quantitative_evaluation_of_blood_components_in_modified_storage_solutions_for_use_in_transfusion_medicine","282155151_3D-Printed_Supercapacitor-Powered_Electrochemiluminescent_Protein_Immunoarray","262220522_Printed_Optics_3D_printing_of_embedded_optical_elements_for_interactive_devices","261882651_3D_Printed_Microfluidic_Devices_with_Integrated_Versatile_and_Reusable_Electrodes","258852468_Recent_advancements_in_chemical_luminescence-based_lab-on-chip_and_microfluidic_platforms_for_bioanalysis"]}
