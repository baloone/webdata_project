{"id":"260071122_Networks_of_Innovation_-_Change_and_Meaning_in_the_Age_of_the_Internet","abstract":"This book argues that innovation is about creating meaning; that it is inherently social; and is grounded in existing social practices. To understand the social basis of innovation and technology development we have to move beyond the traditional product-centric view on innovations. Integrating concepts from several disciplinary perspectives and detailed analyses of the evolution of Internet-related innovations, including packet-switched computer networks, the World Wide Web, and the Linux open source operating system, the book develops foundations for a new theoretical and practical understanding of innovation. For example, it shows that innovative development can occur in two qualitatively different ways, one based on evolving specialization and the other based on recombination of existing socially produced resources. The expanding communication and collaboration networks have increased the importance of the recombinatory mode making mobility of resources, sociotechnical translation mechanisms, and meaning creation in communities of practice increasingly important for innovation research and product development.","authors":["Ilkka Tuomi"],"meta":["January 2003","DOI:10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199269051.001.0001"],"references":["220425727_A_New_View_of_Intellectual_Property_and_Software","3330677_Early_experiences_with_the_Arpanet_and_Internet_in_the_UnitedKingdom","288851902_Data_is_more_than_knowledge","285225837_One_developmental_line_in_European_activity_theories","264383822_Changing_computing_The_computing_community_and_DARPA","262283860_Selectionism_and_complexity","262218069_The_concept_of_design_space","245706750_Communities_and_hierarchies_Structure_in_the_practice_of_science_and_technology","245218846_Technology_Communities_and_Innovation_Communities","229667310_Belief_when_evidence_does_not_support_theory","224333343_History_of_the_Design_of_the_SAGE_Computer-The_ANFSQ-7","220167784_Linux_A_Bazaar_at_the_Edge_of_Chaos","220167628_Speculative_Microeconomics_for_Tomorrow's_Economy","17232950_Reputation_and_Resources_in_Community_Politics","3330608_Douglas_Carl_Engelbart_Developing_the_underlying_concepts_for_contemporary_computing","3330527_The_role_of_ARPA_in_the_development_of_the_ARPANET_1961-1972","3330437_Claims_to_the_term_'time-sharing'"]}
