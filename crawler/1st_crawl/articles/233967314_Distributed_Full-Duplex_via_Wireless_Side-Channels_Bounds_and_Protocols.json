{"id":"233967314_Distributed_Full-Duplex_via_Wireless_Side-Channels_Bounds_and_Protocols","abstract":"In this paper, we study a three-node full-duplex network, where a\nbase-station is engaged in simultaneous up- and downlink communication in the\nsame frequency band with two half-duplex nodes. To reduce the impact of\ninter-node interference on the system capacity, we study how an orthogonal\nside-channel between the two mobile nodes can be leveraged to achieve\nfull-duplex-like multiplexing gains. We propose and characterize the achievable\nrates of four distributed full-duplex schemes, labeled bin-and-cancel,\ncompress-and-cancel, estimate-and-cancel and decode-and-cancel. Of the four,\nbin-and-cancel is shown to achieve within 1 bit/s/Hz of the capacity region for\nall values of channel parameters. In contrast, the other three schemes achieve\nthe near-optimal performance only in certain regimes of channel values.\nAsymptotic multiplexing gains of all proposed schemes are derived to show that\nthe side channel is extremely effective in regimes where inter-node\ninterference has the highest impact.","authors":["Jingwen Bai","Ashutosh Sabharwal"],"meta":["December 2012IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications 12(8)","DOI:10.1109/TWC.2013.071913.122015","SourcearXiv","Project: Massive MIMO Full-duplex"],"references":["235432173_Passive_Self-Interference_Suppression_for_Full-Duplex_InfrastructureNodes","232028220_Design_and_Characterization_of_a_Full-Duplex_Multiantenna_System_for_WiFi_Networks","224155212_Rethinking_Indoor_Wireless_Mesh_Design_Low_Power_Low_Frequency_Full-Duplex","220926549_Achieving_Single_Channel_Full_Duplex_Wireless_Communication","265741502_Full-duplex_Infrastructure_Nodes_Achieving_Long_Range_with_Half-duplex_Mobiles","261319966_Decode-and-cancel_for_interference_cancellation_in_a_three-node_full-duplex_network","254029990_Empowering_full-duplex_wireless_communication_by_exploiting_directional_diversity","224578583_An_Improved_Achievable_Rate_Region_for_Causal_Cognitive_Radio","224505642_Interference_Channel_with_One_Cognitive_Transmitter","224349531_Gaussian_Interference_Channel_Capacity_to_Within_One_Bit"]}
