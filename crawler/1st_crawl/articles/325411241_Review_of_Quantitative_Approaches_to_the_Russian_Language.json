{"id":"325411241_Review_of_Quantitative_Approaches_to_the_Russian_Language","abstract":"Russian linguistics has a tradition of quantitative/mathematical linguistic studies, which can be dated back to the 19th century. Quantitative Linguistics (QL) in Russian had been\ndeveloped synchronously with international QL studies. There was actually a boom for\nRussian quantitative studies in the 1960s-1980s, the most famous of which, including\nPiotrovsky’s “Statistika Reći” (“Parole Statistics”) group, Tuldava’s series of quantitative\nstudies regarding lexical systems, and Arapov’s work of Quantitative Linguistics, etc. The\nexperts in the “Parole statistics” group are not only from linguistics, but also other disciplines\nsuch as computer science, mathematics, psychology, and statistics, etc. However, the QL\nstudies merely vanished after the end of the Soviet Union, although there are still several\nexcellent QL researchers such as B.B. Kromer and A.A. Polikarpov. Kelih (2008) inducted a more systematic historical investigation of the application of quantitative methods in Russian linguistics and literature science, for a review, see Liu (2010).","authors":["Heng Chen"],"meta":["May 2018","Project: quantitative linguistics; second language learning"],"references":["47591663_The_Meaning-Frequency_Relationship_of_Words"]}
