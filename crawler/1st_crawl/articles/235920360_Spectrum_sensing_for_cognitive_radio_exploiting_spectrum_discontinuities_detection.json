{"id":"235920360_Spectrum_sensing_for_cognitive_radio_exploiting_spectrum_discontinuities_detection","abstract":"This article presents a spectrum sensing algorithm for wideband cognitive radio exploiting sensed spectrum discontinuity properties. Some work has already been investigated by wavelet approach by Giannakis et al., but in this article we investigate an algebraic framework in order to model spectrum discontinuities. The information derived at the level of these irregularities will be exploited in order to derive a spectrum sensing algorithm. The numerical simulation show satisfying results in terms of detection performance and receiver operating characteristics curves as the detector takes into account noise annihilation in its inner structure.","authors":["Wael Guibene","Turki Hadj Alouane Monia","Bassem Zayen","Aawatif Hayar"],"meta":["December 2012EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking 2012(1):4","DOI:10.1186/1687-1499-2012-4","Project: Sub space based Blind Sensing"],"references":["245378079_Fundamentals_of_Engineering_Numerical_Analysis","235920362_Distribution_discontinuities_detection_using_algebraic_technique_for_spectrum_sensing_in_cognitive_radio","235920361_Joint_time-frequency_spectrum_sensing_for_Cognitive_Radio","224574908_Blind_Spectrum_Sensing_for_Cognitive_Radio_Based_on_Signal_Space_Dimension_Estimation","224265963_Combined_compressive_sampling_and_distribution_discontinuities_detection_approach_to_wideband_spectrum_sensing_for_cognitive_radios","313136262_Cognitive_radio_for_flexible_mobile_multimedia_communications","291749707_Spectrum_sensing_for_cognitive_radio_applications","224705910_A_Wavelet_Approach_to_Wideband_Spectrum_Sensing_for_Cognitive_Radios","224392604_A_Survey_of_Spectrum_Sensing_Algorithms_for_Cognitive_Radio_Applications","224326600_An_on-line_change-point_detection_method"]}
