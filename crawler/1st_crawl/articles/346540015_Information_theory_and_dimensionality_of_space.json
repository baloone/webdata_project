{"id":"346540015_Information_theory_and_dimensionality_of_space","abstract":"We present an information-theoretic approach to the optimal representation of the intrinsic dimensionality of data and show it is a noninteger. Since optimality is accepted as a physical principle, this provides a theoretical explanation for why noninteger dimensions are useful in many branches of physics, where they have been introduced based on experimental considerations. Noninteger dimensions correlate with lesser density as in the Hausdorff dimension and this can have measurable effects. We use the lower density of noninteger dimension to resolve the problem of two different values of the Hubble constant obtained using different methods.","authors":["Subhash Kak"],"meta":["November 2020Scientific Reports 10(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-020-77855-9"],"references":["342450752_The_Base-e_Representation_of_Numbers_and_the_Power_Law","335668769_Confinement_of_two-body_systems_and_calculations_in_d_dimensions","332933520_Large_Magellanic_Cloud_Cepheid_Standards_Provide_a_1_Foundation_for_the_Determination_of_the_Hubble_Constant_and_Stronger_Evidence_for_Physics_beyond_LCDM","268227198_Analytic_solutions_of_topologically_disjoint_systems","343292606_Information_Representation_and_Structure","342340284_Correlation_function_biasing_and_fractal_properties_of_the_cosmic_web","339525844_The_Megamaser_Cosmology_Project_XIII_Combined_Hubble_Constant_Constraints","336229506_Planck_2018_results_VI_Cosmological_parameters","332280457_Few-body_quantum_method_in_a_d-dimensional_space","324427800_The_Fractal_Geometry_of_Nature"]}
