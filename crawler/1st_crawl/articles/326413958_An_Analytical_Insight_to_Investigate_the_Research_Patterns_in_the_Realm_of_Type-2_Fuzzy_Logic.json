{"id":"326413958_An_Analytical_Insight_to_Investigate_the_Research_Patterns_in_the_Realm_of_Type-2_Fuzzy_Logic","abstract":"Fuzzy logic has always been one of the key research areas in the field of computer science as it helps in dealing with the real world vagueness and uncertainty. In recent years, a variant of it, Type-2 Fuzzy Logic has gained enormous popularity for research purposes. In this paper, an analytical insight is provided into the research patterns of Type-2 Fuzzy logic. Web of Science has been used as the data source which consists of Science Citation Index-Expanded (SCI-E), SSCI, A&HCI and ESCI indexed research papers. 600 research papers were extracted from it in the field of Type-2 fuzzy logic from the year 2000 to 2016, which are analyzed both manually and in an automated manner. The performed study is Scientometric in nature and helps in answering research questions like control terms and top authors in this field, the growth pattern in research publications, top funding agencies and countries etc. The major goal of this study is to analyze the research work in type-2 fuzzy logic so as to track the growth of this discipline through the years and envision future trends in this area.","authors":["Sonakshi Vij","Amita Jain","Devendra Kumar Tayal","Oscar Castillo"],"meta":["July 2018","DOI:10.14313/JAMRIS_2-2018/8"],"references":["315166871_Comparative_Study_of_Image_Thresholding_Using_Type-2_Fuzzy_Sets_and_Cloud_Model","309002447_Interval_Type_2_Fuzzy_Set_in_Fuzzy_Shortest_Path_Problem","336147767_Experimental_validation_of_a_type-2_fuzzy_logic_controller_for_energy_management_in_hybrid_electrical_vehicles","313762212_Impulse_Noise_Removal_From_Digital_Images_by_a_Detail-Preserving_Filter_Based_on_Type-2_Fuzzy_Logic","295679733_SIRMS_based_interval_type-2_fuzzy_inference_systems_Properties_and_application","290024283_A_New_Type-2_Fuzzy_Logic_Based_Controller_for_Unbalance_Problem_of_the_DC-Link_Voltages_of_Five-Level_NPC_Inverter","289960319_Design_of_Interval_Type-2_Fuzzy_Set-based_Fuzzy_Neural_Networks_and_Its_Optimization_Using_Generation-based_Evolution","287694066_Stable_indirect_adaptive_type-2_fuzzy_sliding_mode_control_using_lyapunov_approach","287572990_Type-2_Fuzzy_Logic_Controller_Using_SRUKF-Based_State_Estimations_for_Biped_Walking_Robots","279899242_Analog_circuit_fault_diagnosis_under_parameter_variations_based_on_type-2_fuzzy_logic_systems"]}
