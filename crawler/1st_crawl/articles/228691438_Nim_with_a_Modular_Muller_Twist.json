{"id":"228691438_Nim_with_a_Modular_Muller_Twist","abstract":"We study Nim with the additional rule that each player can put a constraint on the next player's move. This is called a Muller twist. The constraints are of the form \"the number taken must not be equivalent to some numbers modulo n\". A solution for a large group of such games is given.","authors":["Hillevi Gavel","Pontus Strimling"],"meta":["January 2004"],"references":["228611932_Complyconstrain_games_or_games_with_a_Muller_twist","2918288_Dynamic_One-Pile_Blocking_Nim","2382384_Dynamic_One-Pile_Blocking_Nim"]}
