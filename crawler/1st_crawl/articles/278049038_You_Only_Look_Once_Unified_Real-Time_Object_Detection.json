{"id":"278049038_You_Only_Look_Once_Unified_Real-Time_Object_Detection","abstract":"We present YOLO, a unified pipeline for object detection. Prior work on\nobject detection repurposes classifiers to perform detection. Instead, we frame\nobject detection as a regression problem to spatially separated bounding boxes\nand associated class probabilities. A single neural network predicts bounding\nboxes and class probabilities directly from full images in one evaluation.\nSince the whole detection pipeline is a single network, it can be optimized\nend-to-end directly on detection performance. Our unified architecture is also\nextremely fast; YOLO processes images in real-time at 45 frames per second,\nhundreds to thousands of times faster than existing detection systems. Our\nsystem uses global image context to detect and localize objects, making it less\nprone to background errors than top detection systems like R-CNN. By itself,\nYOLO detects objects at unprecedented speeds with moderate accuracy. When\ncombined with state-of-the-art detectors, YOLO boosts performance by 2-3%\npoints mAP.","authors":["Joseph Redmon","Santosh Divvala","Ross Girshick","Ali Farhadi"],"meta":["June 2015","SourcearXiv"],"references":["305196650_Going_deeper_with_convolutions","280608596_The_Fastest_Deformable_Part_Model_for_Object_Detection","275836193_The_Cross-Depiction_Problem_Computer_Vision_Algorithms_for_Recognising_Objects_in_Artwork_and_in_Photographs","265967416_Detecting_People_in_Cubist_Art","265787949_Going_Deeper_with_Convolutions","265295439_ImageNet_Large_Scale_Visual_Recognition_Challenge","262270555_Selective_Search_for_Object_Recognition","259441043_OverFeat_Integrated_Recognition_Localization_and_Detection_using_Convolutional_Networks","259212328_Scalable_Object_Detection_Using_Deep_Neural_Networks","228102719_Improving_neural_networks_by_preventing_co-adaptation_of_feature_detectors","220660094_Robust_Real-Time_Face_Detection","215721846_Robust_Real-Time_Object_Detection","41781863_Learning_to_Localize_Objects_with_Structured_Output_Regression","3766402_General_framework_for_object_detection","319770829_Robust_Real-time_Object_Detection","319770820_Histograms_of_Oriented_Gradients_for_Human_Detection","319770430_Rich_feature_hierarchies_for_accurate_object_detection_and_semantic_segmentation","319770357_DeCAF_A_Deep_Convolutional_Activation_Feature_for_Generic_Visual_Recognition","319770284_Edge_Boxes_Locating_Object_Proposals_from_Edges","295108403_Towards_Unified_Object_Detection_and_Semantic_Segmentation","281327886_Histograms_of_Oriented_Gradients_for_Human_Detection","278691151_30Hz_Object_Detection_with_DPM_V5","277722488_Faster_R-CNN_Towards_Real-Time_Object_Detection_with_Region_Proposal_Networks","275973799_Object_Detection_via_a_Multi-region_and_Semantic_Segmentation-Aware_CNN_Model","275669302_Fast_r-cnn","275364732_Object_Detection_Networks_on_Convolutional_Feature_Maps","269417378_Real-Time_Grasp_Detection_Using_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","269375158_The_Pascal_Visual_Object_Classes_Challenge_A_Retrospective","266081825_Do_More_Dropouts_in_Pool5_Feature_Maps_for_Better_Object_Detection","263237865_Spatial_Pyramid_Pooling_in_Deep_Convolutional_Networks_for_Visual_Recognition","262397182_Diagnosing_Error_in_Object_Detectors","258374356_Rich_Feature_Hierarchies_for_Accurate_Object_Detection_and_Semantic_Segmentation","257409887_DeCAF_A_Deep_Convolutional_Activation_Feature_for_Generic_Visual_Recognition","244706524_Fast_Accurate_Detection_of_100000_Object_Classes_on_a_Single_Machine","224725074_An_Extended_Set_of_Haar-like_Features_for_Rapid_Object_Detection","221617900_Region-based_Segmentation_and_Object_Detection","221304963_Learning_to_Localize_Objects_with_Structured_Output_Regression","221110114_Poselets_Body_Part_Detectors_Trained_Using_3D_Human_Pose_Annotations","45200127_Object_Detection_with_Discriminatively_Trained_Part-Based_Models","3816624_Object_Recognition_from_Local_Scale-Invariant_Features"]}
