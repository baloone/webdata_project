{"id":"336882573_Asynchronous_Switched_Observers_Design_for_Switched_Takagi-Sugeno_Systems_Subject_to_Output_Disturbances","abstract":"This paper deals with the design of asynchronous switched observers for a class of switched continuous-time Takagi-Sugeno (TS) systems subject to output disturbances. The considered switched TS observer is proposed for the continuous state estimation when the active switched modes of the system are unknown or not precisely known. The design conditions, obtained via switched Lyapunov-like function candidates, are expressed as Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) and satisfy Hâˆž disturbance attenuation performances. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated through the simulation of an academic example.","authors":["D.E.C Belkhiat","Dalel Jabri","Kevin Guelton","Noureddine Manamanni"],"meta":["October 2019IFAC Proceedings Volumes (IFAC Papers-OnLine) 52(11):49-54","DOI:10.1016/j.ifacol.2019.09.117","Project: Takagi-Sugeno model-based control"],"references":["326669377_Decentralized_Controller_Design_for_Large_Scale_Switched_Takagi-Sugeno_Systems_with_H_Performance_Specifications","325698838_Interval_observer_design_for_continuous-time_switched_systems_under_known_switching_and_unknown_inputs","290531749_Fault_tolerant_control_for_a_class_of_switched_linear_systems_using_generalized_switched_observer_scheme","330761431_Global_non-quadratic_D-stabilization_of_Takagi-Sugeno_systems_with_piecewise_continuous_membership_functions","328398999_Output-Tracking_Controller_Design_for_Switched_T-S_Systems_Subject_to_External_Disturbances","326704978_State_estimation_for_nonlinear_switched_systems_under_constrained_switching","326701971_Observer-based_Exponential_Stability_for_Time-varying_Delay_Switched_Fuzzy_System_with_Unmeasurable_Premise_Variables","321411487_Robust_estimation_of_vehicle_lateral_velocity_and_yaw_rate_using_switched_T-S_fuzzy_interval_observers","319944335_How_to_cope_with_unmeasurable_premise_variables_in_Takagi-Sugeno_observer_design_Dynamic_extension_approach","302919589_Observer-Based_Output-Feedback_Asynchronous_Control_for_Switched_Fuzzy_Systems"]}
