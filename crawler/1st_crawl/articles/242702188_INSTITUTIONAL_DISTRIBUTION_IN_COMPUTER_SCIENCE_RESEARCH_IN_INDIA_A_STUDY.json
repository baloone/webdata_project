{"id":"242702188_INSTITUTIONAL_DISTRIBUTION_IN_COMPUTER_SCIENCE_RESEARCH_IN_INDIA_A_STUDY","abstract":"The study is based on 1408 research papers published in the international journals on computer s ciences contributed b y the Indian scientists from 1991 to 2 000. The institutional distribution of research has been studied. The scatter of literature is a two- way process controlled by number of institutions contributing literature and the number of journals publishing these contributions. However, major portion of these contributions, as per the analysis, comes from a few institutions, like IITs (located at Kharagpur, Kanpur, Delhi, Chennai and Mumbai), Indian Statistical Institute at Kolkata and Indian Institute of Science (IISc) at Bangalore. The study shows that India has potential of carrying out computer science research of international standard.","authors":["Anup Kumar Das","ARUNA KARANJAI"],"meta":[],"references":[]}
