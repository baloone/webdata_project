{"id":"256981966_Structuring_multi-dimensional_subshifts","abstract":"We study two relations on multi-dimensional subshifts: A pre-order based on\nthe patterns configurations contain and the Cantor-Bendixson rank. We exhibit\nseveral structural properties of two-dimensional subshifts: We characterize the\nsimplest aperiodic configurations in countable SFTs, we give a combinatorial\ncharacterization of uncountable subshifts, we prove that there always exists\nconfigurations without any periodicity but that have the simplest possible\ncombinatorics in countable SFTs. Finally, we prove that some Cantor-Bendixson\nranks are impossible for countable SFTs, leaving only a few unknown cases.","authors":["Alexis Ballier","Emmanuel Jeandel"],"meta":["September 2013","SourcearXiv"],"references":["257299319_Constructions_with_Countable_Subshifts_of_Finite_Type","288373153_Quelques_theoremes_sur_le_mouvement_des_systemes_dynamiques","268889540_Multi-dimensional_symbolic_dynamics","268021072_Linear_sampling_and_the_case_of_the_decision_problem","266211810_Countable_thin_P_1_0_classes","265437979_Topological_Dynamics","258230063_Topological_dynamics","256433279_Members_of_countable_p10_classes","247665721_SUB1_classes_in_mathematics","244424364_Dominoes_and_the_Aea_Case_of_the_Decision_Problem"]}
