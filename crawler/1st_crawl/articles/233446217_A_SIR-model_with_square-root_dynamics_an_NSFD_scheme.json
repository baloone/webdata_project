{"id":"233446217_A_SIR-model_with_square-root_dynamics_an_NSFD_scheme","abstract":"We present a SIR-model for which the interaction term is expressed as the square-root of the S and I variables. General results on the behaviour of the solutions are discussed and a discrete-time, finite difference scheme is constructed using the NSFD methodology of Mickens. An important feature of the scheme is that both the positivity and a conservation law for the system of differential equations are maintained by the discretization.","authors":["Ronald elbert Mickens"],"meta":["February 2010Journal of Difference Equations and Applications 16(2-3):209-216","DOI:10.1080/10236190802495311"],"references":["294468906_On_the_simple_stochastic_epidemic","266035846_On_the_Simple_Stochastic_Epidemic","265330639_Nonstandard_Finite_Difference_Models_of_Differential_Equations","230643917_Numerical_integration_of_population_models_satisfying_conservation_laws_NSFD_methods","229926834_Numerical_Studies_of_a_Nonlinear_Heat_Equation_with_Square_Root_Reaction_Term","229762477_Calculation_of_denominator_functions_for_nonstandard_finite_difference_schemes_for_differential_equations_satisfying_a_positivity_condition","224043450_Mathematical_Models_in_Population_Biology_and_Epidemiology_Springer_New_York","216638161_The_mathematical_theory_of_infectious_diseases_and_its_applications_2nd_ed","216632542_Mathematical_Biology_II","19494329_Dynamic_behavior_of_epidemiologic_models_with_non-linear_incidence_rates","19202575_Influence_of_nonlinear_incidence_rates_upon_the_behavior_of_SIRS_epidemiological_models"]}
