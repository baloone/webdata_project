{"id":"325950749_Experimental_Identification_of_Stress-Strain_Material_Models_of_UHMWPE_Fiber_Cables_for_Improving_Cable_Tension_Control_Strategies","abstract":"Ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene fibers like Dyneema or Spectra are employed in a vast variety of cable-driven parallel robots. The stress-strain dynamics of such cables are highly non-linear with time-varying mechanical parameters, resulting in involved modeling and control of robot dynamics. To improve controllability of cable robots, the cable stress-strain dynamics need to be known and explicitly considered feedforward or closed-loop control. A model can only be deemed suitable, if its inherent dynamics is confirmed through experiments and if it allows for reasonable parameter estimation. We present results of experimental identification of stress-strain dynamics of UHMWPE cables made of Dyneema in different stages of operation. Due to the internal material mechanics, four stages can be identified: the tensing and relaxing transition as well as plateaus coming from either. The implications of verified and parametrized stress-strain models for cable robot tension control strategies is expedited.","authors":["Philipp Tempel","Felix Trautwein","Andreas Pott"],"meta":["January 2019","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-93188-3_30","In book: Advances in Robot Kinematics 2018 (pp.258-265)","Project: Inverse Kinematics and Forward Dynamics of Cable-Driven Parallel Robots"],"references":["321857845_Open-loop_position_control_of_a_polymer_cable-driven_parallel_robot_via_a_viscoelastic_cable_model_for_high_payload_workspaces","316461784_Dynamics_and_Control_of_a_6-dof_Cable-driven_Parallel_Robot_with_Visco-elastic_Cables_in_Presence_of_Measurement_Noise","309525139_Mechanical_characterization_of_human_brain_tissue","303885676_Hysteresis_model_of_longitudinally_loaded_cable_for_cable_driven_robots_and_identification_of_the_parameters","265508266_An_Elastic_Cable_Model_for_Cable-Driven_Parallel_Robots_Including_Hysteresis_Effects","263247466_IPAnema_A_family_of_Cable-Driven_Parallel_Robots_for_Industrial_Applications","300891852_Constitutive_Equations_for_Isotropic_and_Anisotropic_Linear_Viscoelastic_Materials","269630160_Robust_Internal_Force-Based_Impedance_Control_for_Cable-Driven_Parallel_Robots","265508265_Extending_Dynamic_Trajectories_of_Cable-Driven_Parallel_Robots_as_a_Novel_Robotic_Roller_Coaster","253296348_Springer_Handbook_of_Materials_Measurement_Methods"]}
