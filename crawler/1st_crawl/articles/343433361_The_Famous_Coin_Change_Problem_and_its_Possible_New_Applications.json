{"id":"343433361_The_Famous_Coin_Change_Problem_and_its_Possible_New_Applications","abstract":"The classical problem “Coin change” in Computer Science has become a key problem to a number of subsequent problems in different areas: finance, algorithm study, sports, etc. Mathematicians have been paying attention to only two possible outcomes of the problem: the most time/resource efficient solution and the total number of solutions. However, solutions among the “normal solutions” can be beneficial in certain situations, if carefully considered with math and economic phenomena in the past. Our work describes some of such possible beneficial solutions that are worth paying attention to and its application in finance and fiscal policy. Now it is of particular importance because of COVID-19 pandemic.","authors":["Quang Vu"],"meta":["August 2020Undergraduate Journal of Mathematical Modeling One + Two 11(1)","DOI:10.5038/2326-3652.11.1.4924"],"references":[]}
