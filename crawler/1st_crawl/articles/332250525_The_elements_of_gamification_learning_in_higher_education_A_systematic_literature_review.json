{"id":"332250525_The_elements_of_gamification_learning_in_higher_education_A_systematic_literature_review","abstract":"Gamification is a concept in which elements of the game in the environment are not games. This concept has been widely used in the educational world. Many universities are starting to change the way of learning by incorporating elements of the game and using different learning tools that have game elements in the learning process. Therefore, this article will further discuss which elements of the game have been used most in gamification learning and the impact of applying gamification learning to students. This study used systematic literature review approach using articles published in 2014-2018. Can be found if points, badges and leaderboard are the three main elements that are widely used in gamification learning.","authors":["Natalia Limantara","Meyliana Widjaja","Achmad Nizar Hidayanto","Harjanto Prabowo"],"meta":["February 2019"],"references":["328770526_The_effectiveness_of_gamification_technique_for_higher_education_students_engagement_in_polytechnic_Muadzam_Shah_Pahang_Malaysia","326708149_Influence_of_gamification_on_student_motivation_in_the_educational_process_in_courses_of_different_fields","326699944_Measurement_of_the_effects_of_e-learning_courses_gamification_on_motivation_and_satisfaction_of_students","326540446_Students'_perception_of_Kahoot's_influence_on_teaching_and_learning","325528964_Online_Learning_Readiness_and_Attitudes_Towards_Gaming_in_Gamified_Online_Learning_-_A_Mixed_Methods_Case_Study","323204316_Evaluating_student_perceptions_of_using_a_game-based_approach_to_aid_learning_Braincept","322828082_Enhancing_student_learning_experience_with_technology-mediated_gamification_An_empirical_study","319242102_Don't_Make_the_Player_Make_the_Game_Exploring_the_Potential_of_Gamification_in_IS_Education","318901719_Using_a_gamified_mobile_app_to_increase_student_engagement_retention_and_academic_achievement","310020732_An_Empirical_Study_Inspecting_the_Benefits_of_Gamification_Applied_to_University_Classes","308624327_Designing_game-like_activities_to_engage_adult_learners_in_higher_education","306374485_Using_gamification_to_develop_academic_writing_skills_in_dental_undergraduate_students","305885041_Teachers'_Attitude_towards_and_Actual_Use_of_Gamification","290648567_A_definition_for_gamification_anchoring_gamification_in_the_service_marketing_literature","280055756_A_Game-Based_Learning_Environment_Using_the_ARCS_Model_at_a_University_Library","266852840_Gamification_and_Student_Motivation","328978802_Increasing_students'_motivation_by_using_virtual_learning_environments_based_on_gamification_mechanics_Implementation_and_evaluation_of_gamified_assignments_for_students","328816868_Fun_and_games_in_higher_education_an_analysis_of_UK_student_perspectives","328580016_Implementing_gamification_in_a_university-level_UML_modeling_course_A_case_study","327785590_Does_educational_gamification_improve_students'_motivation_If_so_which_game_elements_work_best","326506585_Gamifying_the_First_Programming_Class_Outcomes_and_Antecedents_of_Continued_Engagement_Intention","326091527_One_Game_Does_not_Fit_All_Gamification_and_Learning_Overview_and_Future_Directions","324670019_Empirical_Support_for_a_Causal_Relationship_Between_Gamification_and_Learning_Outcomes","323473231_Uses_and_Gratifications_of_Initiating_Use_of_Gamifed_Learning_Platforms","317019446_Stimulating_students'_engagement_in_mathematics_courses_in_non-STEM_academic_programmes_A_game-based_learning","315473130_Personalization_of_gamification-elements_in_an_e-learning_environment_based_on_learners'_motivation","314247012_The_effects_of_gamification-based_teaching_practices_on_student_achievement_and_students'_attitudes_toward_lessons","311093965_Individualising_gamification_An_investigation_of_the_impact_of_learning_styles_and_personality_traits_on_the_efficacy_of_gamification_using_a_prediction_market","283754292_The_use_of_GBL_to_teach_mathematics_in_higher_education","282545391_The_effects_of_students'_motivation_cognitive_load_and_learning_anxiety_in_gamification_software_engineering_education_a_structural_equation_modeling_study","259137324_A_systematic_review_of_systematic_review_process_research_in_software_engineering"]}
