{"id":"331412609_Multilayer_Clustered_Sampling_Technique_MLCS_for_Near-Earth_Asteroid_Impact_Hazard_Assessment","abstract":"Because of planetary encounters, the motion of near-Earth asteroids is chaotic and small differences in the initial conditions tend to diverge exponentially. Linear approximations for propagating orbital uncertainties can lead to inaccurate estimates of the probability of an Earth collision. We present a novel fully nonlinear strategy for estimating the probability of an asteroid impact using sequential Monte Carlo layers. The method first explores a low-resolution layer to locate potentially relevant regions. Then, we conduct localized searches on deeper layers with higher resolution. The method retains the accuracy of brute-force Monte Carlo sampling while reducing the computational cost by only sampling relevant regions.","authors":["Javier Roa","Davide Farnocchia"],"meta":["January 2019","Conference: 29th AAS/AIAA Space Flight Mechanics MeetingAt: Ka'anapali, Maui, HI"],"references":["326402622_A_differential_algebra_based_importance_sampling_method_for_impact_probability_computation_on_Earth_resonant_returns_of_Near_Earth_Objects","273331376_The_Yarkovsky_effect_for_99942_Apophis","234518936_NEODyS_an_online_information_system_for_near-Earth_objects","305397619_Data_Clustering_A_Review","303009860_Orbits_long-term_predictions_and_impact_monitoring","299692736_Monte_Carlo_and_Quasi-Monte_Carlo_Methods","270352296_Numerical_Taxonomy_The_Principles_and_Practice_of_Numerical_Classification","268718670_Rare_Event_Simulation_Using_Monte_Carlo_Methods","234338066_Sentry_An_Automated_Close_Approach_Monitoring_System_for_Near-Earth_Objects","234066667_Yarkovsky-driven_impact_risk_analysis_for_asteroid_99942_Apophis"]}
