{"id":"342509380_LIONESS_Lab_a_free_web-based_platform_for_conducting_interactive_experiments_online","abstract":"LIONESS Lab is a free web-based platform for interactive online experiments. An intuitive, user-friendly graphical interface enables researchers to develop, test, and share experiments online, with minimal need for programming experience. LIONESS Lab provides solutions for the methodological challenges of interactive online experimentation, including ways to reduce waiting time, form groups on-the-fly, and deal with participant dropout. We highlight key features of the software, and show how it meets the challenges of conducting interactive experiments online.","authors":["Marcus Giamattei","Kyanoush Seyed Yahosseini","Simon GÃ¤chter","Lucas Molleman"],"meta":["June 2020Journal of the Economic Science Association 6(1)","DOI:10.1007/s40881-020-00087-0"],"references":["346716859_Strategies_for_integrating_disparate_social_information","340502509_Do_Descriptive_Social_Norms_Drive_Peer_Punishment_Conditional_Punishment_Strategies_and_Their_Impact_on_Cooperation","337435893_Social_information_use_in_adolescents_The_impact_of_adults_peers_and_household_composition","335569700_People_prefer_coordinated_punishment_in_cooperative_interactions","335437684_Test-retest_reliability_of_canonical_reinforcement_learning_models","332907612_Conducting_Interactive_Experiments_Online","341930848_Him_or_her_Choosing_competition_on_behalf_of_someone_else_Him_or_her_Choosing_competition_on_behalf_of_someone_else","334054733_Unleashing_the_BEAST_a_brief_measure_of_human_social_information_use","332994409_Web-based_experimental_economics_software_How_do_they_compare_to_desirable_features","332731461_classEx_-_an_online_tool_for_lab-in-the-field_experiments_with_smartphones"]}
