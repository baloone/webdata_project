{"id":"262401690_Learning_to_Teach_Computer_Science_The_Need_for_a_Methods_Course","abstract":"COMPUTER SCIENCE IS a crucial driver of innovation and productivity in our technologyrich society and there is a strong demand for computationally educated workers. Yet, there is a shortage of computer science undergraduates and computationally educated students. Furthermore, computer science plays only a minor role in high school curricula in the United States. Exposing students to computer science in K-12 education could be a natural pipeline for the field, but the U.S. is facing a very different reality: only 15,000 high school students take the Advanced Placement Computer Science (APCS) exam annually, less than 10% of U.S. high schools offer an APCS course, and nationally there are only 2,000 teachers qualified to teach the APCS course.","authors":["Aman Yadav","John Timothy Korb"],"meta":["November 2012Communications of the ACM 55(11):31-33","DOI:10.1145/2366316.2366327","Project: CS4EDU: Computer Science for Education"],"references":["240645823_Defining_Reflection_Another_Look_at_John_Dewey_and_Reflective_Thinking","229007846_The_Current_State_of_Computer_Science_in_US_High_Schools_A_Report_from_Two_National_Surveys","220808062_Wu's_Castle_Teaching_arrays_and_loops_in_a_game","314795390_Teaching_two-dimensional_array_concepts_in_Java_with_image_processing_examples","266992922_Guide_to_teaching_computer_science_An_activity-based_approach","255626701_Breaking_with_experience_in_learning_to_teach_mathematics_The_role_of_a_preservice_methods_course","243769802_Those_Who_Understand_Knowledge_Growth_in_Teaching","222311203_Building_support_for_language_and_early_literacy_in_preschool_classrooms_through_in-service_professional_development_Effects_of_the_Literacy_Environment_Enrichment_Program_LEEP","220693000_Computer_Science_Unplugged_-_an_enrichment_and_extension_programme_for_primary-aged_children","220612852_Methods_of_teaching_a_computer_science_course_for_prospective_teachers"]}
