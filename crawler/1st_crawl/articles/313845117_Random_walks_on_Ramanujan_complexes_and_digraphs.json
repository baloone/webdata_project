{"id":"313845117_Random_walks_on_Ramanujan_complexes_and_digraphs","abstract":"The cutoff phenomenon was recently confirmed for random walks on Ramanujan graphs by the first author and Peres (2016). In this work, we obtain analogs in higher dimensions, for random walk operators on any Ramanujan complex associated with a simple group $G$ over a local field $F$. We show that if $T$ is any $k$-regular $G$-equivariant operator on the Bruhat-Tits building with a simple combinatorial property (collision-free), the associated random walk on the $n$-vertex Ramanujan complex has cutoff at time $\\log_k n$. This is established by systematically studying the mixing of random walks on Ramanujan digraphs with certain properties. We then show that the digraph arising from such an operator $T$ on a Ramanujan complex has these properties. Applications include geodesic flow operators, geometric implications, and a confirmation of the Riemann Hypothesis for the associated zeta functions over every group $G$, previously known for groups of type $\\widetilde A_n$ and $\\widetilde C_2$.","authors":["Eyal Lubetzky","Alexander Lubotzky","Ori Parzanchevski"],"meta":["February 2017Journal of the European Mathematical Society 22(11)","DOI:10.4171/JEMS/990"],"references":["275974763_Zeta_and_L-functions_of_finite_quotients_of_apartments_and_buildings","265386034_Isoperimetric_Inequalities_for_Ramanujan_Complexes_and_Topological_Expanders","324767808_Markov_Chains_and_Mixing_Times","312031155_Lp_expander_Complexes","302568202_The_Ramanujan_Property_for_Simplicial_Complexes","285458722_Diameter_of_Ramanujan_Graphs_and_Random_Cayley_Graphs_with_Numerics","283933280_Riemann_Hypothesis_and_strongly_Ramanujan_complexes_from_GL","282639642_Systolic_Expanders_of_Every_Dimension","274319824_Finite_quotients_of_Bruhat-Tits_buildings_as_geometric_expanders","265541116_Buildings_and_classical_groups"]}
