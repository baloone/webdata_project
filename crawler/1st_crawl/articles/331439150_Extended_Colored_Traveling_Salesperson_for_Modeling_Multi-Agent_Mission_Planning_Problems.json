{"id":"331439150_Extended_Colored_Traveling_Salesperson_for_Modeling_Multi-Agent_Mission_Planning_Problems","abstract":"In recent years, multi-agent systems have been widely used in different missions, ranging from underwater to airborne. A mission typically involves a large number of agents and tasks, making it very hard for the human operator to create a good plan. A search for an optimal plan may take too long, and it is hard to make a time estimate of when the planner will finish. A Genetic algorithm based planner is proposed in order to overcome this issue. The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation of a novel Extended Colored Traveling Salesperson Problem (ECTSP) is given. Second, a new objective function suitable for multi-agent mission planning problems is proposed. Finally, a reparation algorithm to allow usage of common variation operators for ECTSP has been developed.","authors":["Branko Miloradovic","Baran Çürüklü","Mikael Ekström","Alessandro Vittorio Papadopoulos"],"meta":["February 2019","DOI:10.5220/0007309002370244","Conference: 8th International Conference on Operations Research and Enterprise SystemsAt: Prague","Project: SWARMs"],"references":["315886590_Underwater_Robot_Task_Planning_Using_Multi-Objective_Meta-Heuristics","309345848_A_taxonomy_for_task_allocation_problems_with_temporal_and_ordering_constraints","308994035_A_genetic_planner_for_mission_planning_of_cooperative_agents_in_an_underwater_environment","325762946_Weighted_strategies_to_guide_a_multi-objective_evolutionary_algorithm_for_multi-UAV_mission_planning","318801103_A_research_framework_on_mission_planning_of_the_UAV_swarm","318294108_New_Artificial_Intelligence_approaches_for_future_UAV_Ground_Control_Stations","317596163_Variable_Neighborhood_Search_for_a_Colored_Traveling_Salesman_Problem","315595668_Handling_swarm_of_UAVs_based_on_evolutionary_multi-objective_optimization","308734919_Multi-agent_approach_for_task_allocation_and_scheduling_in_cooperative_heterogeneous_multi-robot_team_Simulation_results","284887329_GAMPP_Genetic_algorithm_for_UAV_mission_planning_problems"]}
