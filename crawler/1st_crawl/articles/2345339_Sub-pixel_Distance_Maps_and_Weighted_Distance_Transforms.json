{"id":"2345339_Sub-pixel_Distance_Maps_and_Weighted_Distance_Transforms","abstract":"A new framework for computing the Euclidean distance and weighted distance from the boundary of a given digitized shape is presented. The distance is calculated with sub--pixel accuracy. The algorithm is based on an equal distance contour evolution process. The moving contour is embedded as a level set in a time varying function of higher dimension. This representation of the evolving contour makes possible the use of an accurate and stable numerical scheme, due to Osher and Sethian [22]. The relation between the classical shape from shading problem and the weighted distance transform is presented, as well as an algorithm that calculates the geodesic distance transform on surfaces. Keywords: distance transforms, weighted distance, curve evolution, differential geometry, continuous scale morphology.
