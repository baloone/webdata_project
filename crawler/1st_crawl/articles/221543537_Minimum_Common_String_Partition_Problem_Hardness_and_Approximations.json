{"id":"221543537_Minimum_Common_String_Partition_Problem_Hardness_and_Approximations","abstract":"String comparison is a fundamental problem in computer science, with applications in areas such as computational biology,\ntext processing or compression. In this paper we address the minimum common string partition problem, a string comparison\nproblem with tight connection to the problem of sorting by reversals with duplicates, a key problem in genome rearrangement.\n\nA partition of a string A is a sequence P=(P1,P2,...Pm){\\mathcal P}=(P_{1},P_{2},...P_{m}) of strings, called the blocks, whose concatenation is equal to A. Given a partition P{\\mathcal P} of a string A and a partition Q{\\mathcal Q} of a string B, we say that the pair áP,Qñ\\langle\\mathcal{P,Q}\\rangle is a common partition of A and B if Q{\\mathcal Q} is a permutation of P{\\mathcal P}. The minimum common string partition problem (MCSP) is to find a common partition of two strings A and B with the minimum number of blocks. The restricted version of MCSP where each letter occurs at most k times in each input string, is denoted by k-MCSP.\n\nIn this paper, we show that 2-MCSP (and therefore MCSP) is NP-hard and, moreover, even APX-hard. We describe a 1.1037-approximation for 2-MCSP and a linear time 4-approximation algorithm for 3-MCSP. We are not aware of any better approximations.","authors":["Avraham Goldstein","Petr Kolman","Jie Zheng"],"meta":["December 2004The Electronic Journal of Combinatorics 12(1):484-495","DOI:10.1007/978-3-540-30551-4_43","SourceDBLP","Conference: Algorithms and Computation, 15th International Symposium, ISAAC 2004, Hong Kong, China, December 20-22, 2004, Proceedings"],"references":["228612727_The_assignment_of_orthologous_genes_via_genome_rearrangement","225136861_The_Greedy_Algorithm_for_the_Minimum_Common_String_Partition_Problem","338532075_Minimum_Common_String_Partition_Problem_Hardness_and_Approximations","242626396_The_Chromosome_Inversion_Problem","228057735_Computers_And_Intractability_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness","225917194_Edit_Distance_with_Move_Operations","225912148_Approximating_MIN_k-SAT","225453999_Approximating_Reversal_Distance_for_Strings_with_Bounded_Number_of_Duplicates","221530668_Sorting_by_reversals_is_difficult","221530466_Multiple_Genome_Rearrangement"]}
