{"id":"333652827_Simpson's_Type_Inequalities_for_Co-Ordinated_Convex_Functions_on_Quantum_Calculus","abstract":"In the present paper, we aim to prove a new lemma and quantum Simpson’s type inequalities for functions of two variables having convexity on co-ordinates over [ α , β ] × [ ψ , ϕ ] . Moreover, our deduction introduce new direction as well as validate the previous results.","authors":["Humaira Kalsoom","Wu Junde","Sabir Hussain","Muhammad Amer Latif"],"meta":["June 2019Symmetry","DOI:10.3390/sym11060768","Project: Post Quantum Calculus Simpson’s Type Inequalities for Coordinates"],"references":["330905703_Some_Quantum_Estimates_of_Hermite-Hadamard_Inequalities_for_Quasi-Convex_Functions","307728332_On_new_inequalities_of_Simpson's_type_for_quasi-convex_functions_with_applications","305888398_Some_q-analogues_of_Hermite-Hadamard_inequality_of_functions_of_two_variables_on_finite_rectangles_in_the_plane","281759795_Quantum_integral_inequalities_for_convex_functions","280831870_Some_quantum_integral_inequalities_via_preinvex_functions","274693941_Quantum_integral_inequalities_on_finite_intervals","270464054_Quantum_calculus_on_finite_intervals_and_applications_to_impulsive_difference_equations","269889467_Some_quantum_estimates_for_Hermite-Hadamard_inequalities","326237292_Simpson_type_quantum_integral_inequalities_for_convex_functions","279385269_A_Comprehensive_Treatment_of_q-Calculus"]}
