{"id":"323627176_Broadcast_domination_and_multipacking_bounds_and_the_integrality_gap","abstract":"In 2001, Erwin introduced broadcast domination in graphs. It is a variant of classical graph domination where selected vertices may have different domination ranges. The minimum cost of a dominating broadcast in a graph $G$ is denoted by $\\gamma_b(G)$. When formulated as an integer linear program, the dual of broadcast domination is called multipacking: a multipacking is a set $P\\subseteq V(G)$ such that for any vertex $v$ and any positive integer $r$, the ball of radius $r$ around $v$ contains at most $r$ vertices of $P$. The maximum size of a multipacking in a graph $G$ is denoted by $mp(G)$. Naturally, $mp(G) \\leq \\gamma_b(G)$. In this paper, we show that $\\gamma_b(G) \\leq 2mp(G) + 3$.","authors":["Laurent Beaudou","Richard C.
