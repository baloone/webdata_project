{"id":"242802838_Evolution_of_inelastic_plane_curves","abstract":"We derive the evolution equations for an inelastic plane curve, i.e., a curve whose length is preserved over all time. Necessary and sufficient conditions for an inelastic curve flow are expressed as a partial differential equation involving the curvature. Some examples of inelastic curve flows are considered for illustration.","authors":["D. Y. Kwon","F. C.
