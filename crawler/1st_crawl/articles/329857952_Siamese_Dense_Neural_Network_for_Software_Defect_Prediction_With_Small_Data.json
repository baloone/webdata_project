{"id":"329857952_Siamese_Dense_Neural_Network_for_Software_Defect_Prediction_With_Small_Data","abstract":"Software defect prediction (SDP) exerts a major role in software development, concerning with reducing software costs and ensuring software quality. However, developing an accurate SDP model is still a severe and challenging task with the lack of training data. Fortunately, Siamese networks are powerful for learning a few samples and have been perfectly used in other fields. This paper explores the advantages of Siamese networks to propose a novel SDP model, Siamese Dense neural networks (SDNN), which integrates similarity feature learning and distance metric learning into a unified approach. It mainly includes two phases: model building and training. To be more specific, it means building the novel SDNN for capturing the highest-level similarity features, and training the model to realize prediction through the designed contrast loss function with cosine-proximity. Importantly, we extensively compared SDNN approach with the state-of-the-art SDP approaches utilizing 10 software defect datasets. Experimental results show that our SDNN is a competitive approach and able to improve the prediction performance more significantly compared with the benchmarked approaches.","authors":["Linchang Zhao","Zhaowei Shang","Anyong Qin","Yuan Yan Tang"],"meta":["December 2018IEEE Access PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2889061"],"references":["323536716_Software_Bug_Prediction_using_Machine_Learning_Approach","322599368_Deep_neural_network_based_hybrid_approach_for_software_defect_prediction_using_software_metrics","318873760_Easy_over_hard_a_case_study_on_deep_learning","318863866_The_application_of_ROC_analysis_in_threshold_identification_data_imbalance_and_metrics_selection_for_software_fault_prediction","309149831_Thresholds_for_Size_and_Complexity_Metrics_A_Case_Study_from_the_Perspective_of_Defect_Density","307558687_Siamese_Recurrent_Architectures_for_Learning_Sentence_Similarity","304834009_Learning_Text_Similarity_with_Siamese_Recurrent_Networks","304018243_Learning_feed-forward_one-shot_learners","303099416_Automated_parameter_optimization_of_classification_techniques_for_defect_prediction_models","277411157_Deep_Learning","262003721_Researcher_Bias_The_Use_of_Machine_Learning_in_Software_Defect_Prediction","259980526_Combining_Particle_Swarm_Optimization_based_Feature_Selection_and_Bagging_Technique_for_Software_Defect_Prediction","222518307_A_systematic_review_of_effect_size_in_software_engineering_experiments","220520041_A_Study_of_the_Behavior_of_Several_Methods_for_Balancing_machine_Learning_Training_Data","220069502_Data_Mining_Static_Code_Attributes_to_Learn_Defect_Predictors","216792753_Loss_Functions_for_Discriminative_Training_of_Energy-Based_Models","48343664_Estimator_and_Tests_for_Common_Coefficients_of_Variation_in_Normal_Distributions","4156225_Learning_a_similarity_metric_discriminatively_with_application_to_face_verification","329740353_Learning_to_Compare_Relation_Network_for_Few-Shot_Learning","325055693_In_Defense_of_Fully_Connected_Layers_in_Visual_Representation_Transfer","323195251_Investigating_Siamese_LSTM_networks_for_text_categorization","323110405_A_review_on_the_application_of_deep_learning_in_system_health_management","321493475_Underwater_pipelines_panoramic_image_transmission_and_refinement_using_acoustic_sensors","321469279_Software_Defect_Prediction_Using_Stacked_Denoising_Autoencoders_and_Two-stage_Ensemble_Learning","320896525_Learning_to_classify_software_defects_from_crowds_A_novel_approach","320220877_Embedding_Structured_Contour_and_Location_Prior_in_Siamesed_Fully_Convolutional_Networks_for_Road_Detection","319945791_Fuzzy-Based_Information_Decomposition_for_Incomplete_and_Imbalanced_Data_Learning","318121287_Zero-Shot_Learning_-_A_Comprehensive_Evaluation_of_the_Good_the_Bad_and_the_Ugly","317872444_A_feature_matching_and_transfer_approach_for_cross-company_defect_prediction","316448103_Siamese_network_features_for_image_matching","315096921_Prototypical_Networks_for_Few-shot_Learning","311609041_Deep_Residual_Learning_for_Image_Recognition","307632169_Learning_to_compare_image_patches_via_convolutional_neural_networks","285360850_Lines_of_Comments_as_a_Noteworthy_Metric_for_Analyzing_Fault-Proneness_in_Methods","272846144_Negative_samples_reduction_in_cross-company_software_defects_prediction","269935079_Adam_A_Method_for_Stochastic_Optimization","261450527_Evaluating_the_correlation_between_software_defect_and_design_coupling_metrics","235271440_Reflections_on_the_NASA_MDP_data_sets","228328538_A_Complexity_Measure","220733632_Normalized_minimum-redundancy_and_maximum-relevancy_based_feature_selection_for_speaker_verification_systems"]}
