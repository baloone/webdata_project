{"id":"229067733_Linear_Pattern_Matching_Algorithm","abstract":"In 1970, Knuth, Pratt, and Morris [1] showed how to do basic pattern matching in linear time. Related problems, such as those discussed in [4], have previously been solved by efficient but sub-optimal algorithms. In this paper, we introduce an interesting data structure called a bi-tree. A linear time algorithm for obtaining a compacted version of a bi-tree associated with a given string is presented. With this construction as the basic tool, we indicate how to solve several pattern matching problems, including some from [4] in linear time.","authors":["Peter Weiner"],"meta":["November 1973Switching and Automata Theory, 1966., IEEE Conference Record of Seventh Annual Symposium on","DOI:10.1109/SWAT.1973.13","Conference: 14th Annual IEEE Symposium on Switching and Automata Theory"],"references":["221591625_Rapid_Identification_of_Repeated_Patterns_in_Strings_Trees_and_Arrays","289699927_A_novel_fast_pattern_matching_algorithm","284392054_Linear_time_simulation_of_deterministic_two-way_pushdown_automata","265423473_The_art_of_computer_programming_Vol_IV_3_parts","262155109_Satisfiability_and_The_Art_of_Computer_Programming","240319397_The_file_transmission_problem","235047912_String-Matching_and_Other_Products","220431230_The_String-to-String_Correction_Problem"]}
