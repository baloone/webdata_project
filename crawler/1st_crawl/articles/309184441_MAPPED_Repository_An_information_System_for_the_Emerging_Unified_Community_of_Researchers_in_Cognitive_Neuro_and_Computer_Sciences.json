{"id":"309184441_MAPPED_Repository_An_information_System_for_the_Emerging_Unified_Community_of_Researchers_in_Cognitive_Neuro_and_Computer_Sciences","abstract":"The disconnect between scientific schools of thought across the world is most notable in cognitive, neural, and computer sciences. The intersection of these fields is exactly where a powerful new approach has emerged recently, known as Biologically Inspired Cognitive Architectures (BICA). Here we describe a new initiative: to build an open informational resource for the emerging international community of researchers unified by the BICA Challenge - the challenge to create a computational replica of the human mind using solutions inspired by the brain. We call it the MAPPED repository, named by the following six components: Models, Architectures, People, Paradigms, Evaluations, and Dialogues, all represented by six components of the unified database.","authors":["Alexei Samsonovich","Alexander Bondarenko","Daniil A.
