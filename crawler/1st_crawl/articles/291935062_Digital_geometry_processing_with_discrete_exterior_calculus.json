{"id":"291935062_Digital_geometry_processing_with_discrete_exterior_calculus","abstract":"These notes provide an introduction to working with real-world geometric data, expressed\nin the language of discrete exterior calculus (DEC). DEC is a simple, flexible, and efficient framework\nwhich provides a unified platform for geometry processing. The notes provide essential\nmathematical background as well as a large array of real-world examples, with an emphasis on\napplications and implementation. The material should be accessible to anyone with some exposure\nto basic linear algebra and vector calculus, though most of the key concepts are reviewed as needed.\nCoding exercises depend on a basic knowledge of C++, though knowledge of any programming\nlanguage is likely sufficient: we do not make heavy use of paradigms like inheritance, templates,\netc. The notes also provide guided written exercises that can be used to deepen understanding of\nthe material.","authors":["Keenan Crane"],"meta":["July 2013","Conference: SIGGRAPH '13 Special Interest Group on Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques Conference"],"references":[]}
