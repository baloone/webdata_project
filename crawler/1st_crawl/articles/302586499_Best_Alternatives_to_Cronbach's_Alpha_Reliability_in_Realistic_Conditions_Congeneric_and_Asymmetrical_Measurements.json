{"id":"302586499_Best_Alternatives_to_Cronbach's_Alpha_Reliability_in_Realistic_Conditions_Congeneric_and_Asymmetrical_Measurements","abstract":"The Cronbach's alpha is the most widely used method for estimating internal consistency reliability. This procedure has proved very resistant to the passage of time, even if its limitations are well documented and although there are better options as omega coefficient or the different versions of glb, with obvious advantages especially for applied research in which the Ã­tems differ in quality or have skewed distributions. In this paper, using Monte Carlo simulation, the performance of these reliability coefficients under a one-dimensional model is evaluated in terms of skewness and no tau-equivalence. The results show that omega coefficient is always better choice than alpha and in the presence of skew items is preferable to use omega glb coefficients even in small samples.\nhttp://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00769/abstract","authors":["Italo Trizano Hermosilla","Jesus M.
