{"id":"336851708_The_Logic_in_Computer_Science_Column","abstract":"Boolean and quantum circuits have commonalities and differences. To formalize the syntactical commonality we introduce syntactic circuits where the gates are black boxes. Syntactic circuits support various semantics. One semantics is provided by Boolean circuits, another by quantum circuits. Quantum semantics is a generalization of Boolean but, because of entanglement, the generalization is not straightforward. We consider only unitary quantum circuits here.","authors":["Yuri Gurevich"],"meta":["October 2019"],"references":["224951985_Magic-State_Distillation_in_All_Prime_Dimensions_Using_Quantum_Reed-Muller_Codes","3224990_Synthesis_of_reversible_logic_circuits","345676927_Introduction_to_Reversible_Computing","320900669_Theory_of_Reversible_Computing","302893429_Factoring_with_Qutrits_Shor's_Algorithm_on_Ternary_and_Metaplectic_Quantum_Architectures","220690134_Reversible_Computing_Fundamentals_Quantum_Computing_and_Applications","200524403_Quantum_Computation_and_Quantum_Information","2192924_Q-circuit_Tutorial"]}
