{"id":"317905302_B013_Surface_Texturing_and_Wettability_Evaluation_of_Zirconia_Ceramics","abstract":"The poor bonding strength between dental zirconia implants and resin luting cements limits the practical applications of zirconia ceramics. Better wettability is a prerequisite for strong bonding strength. A new surface treatment technology was proposed to improve the wettability of zirconia by creating micro/nano surface textures. The technology was referred as ultrasonic-vibration assisted slant-feed grinding (UASG). Three ultrasonic vibration modes were employed for surface texturing by UASG and different types of micro/nano surface textures were fabricated successfully. The contact angle measurement revealed that these micro/nano textured surfaces had better surface wettability than that of surfaces fabricated by conventional grinding.","authors":["Shaolin Xu","Keita SHIMADA","Masayoshi MIZUTANI","Tsunemoto KURIYAGAWA"],"meta":["November 2013Proceedings of International Conference on Leading Edge Manufacturing in 21st century LEM21 2013.7:208-213","DOI:10.1299/jsmelem.2013.7.208"],"references":[]}
