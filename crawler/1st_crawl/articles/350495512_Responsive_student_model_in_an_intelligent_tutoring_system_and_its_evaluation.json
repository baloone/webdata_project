We proposed a weighted-based model to estimate and suggest learning materials for students who are pursuing a computer-based course. We have built a brand new ITS called WinITS with our proposed responsive student model and deployed it in Hanoi National University of Education-Vietnam (HNUE) in the second semester of the school year 2019-2020 with a computer science course. To compare the effectiveness of applying ITS to the students, we compare test results and analyze some other aspects related to the course. On the other hand, we conducted a survey between two groups: with and without using WinITS. 63 students are volunteers who participated in the case study. Before learning, 43 students from Group 1 will take a short survey of the Felder-Silverman questionnaire to identify learning styles, after that, they go through all the lessons from the course under the support of WinITS, the lessons will be chosen to satisfy studentâ€™s need. On another side, 18 students from Group 2 will make the same test to compare the result to Group 1. In the range of research, we illustrate that our implementation shows some encouraging results such as reducing learning time, improving test score by 1.13 standard deviations, and making the lesson more interesting and flexible. The results have revealed some advantages of studying with computer-added compared to the traditional class in various ways and showed the effectiveness of the proposed model in Intelligent Tutoring Systems.","authors":["Binh Hoang Tieu","The Duy Bui"],"meta":["July 2021Education and Information Technologies 26(2)","DOI:10.1007/s10639-021-10485-4","Project: Predicting Students' performance based on Learning Style by using Artificial Neural Networks"],"references":["338942125_Detecting_Student_Engagement_in_Classrooms_for_Intelligent_Tutoring_Systems","336828485_Association_of_learning_styles_with_different_e-learning_problems_a_systematic_review_and_classification","329787489_Intelligent_tutoring_systems_a_systematic_review_of_characteristics_applications_and_evaluation_methods_Intelligent_tutoring_systems_a_systematic_review_of_characteristics_applications_and_evaluation_","328711554_Use_of_Felder_and_Silverman_learning_style_model_for_online_course_design","312470401_Learningteaching_styles_in_engineering_education","311452891_Los_Estilos_de_Aprendizaje_Procedimientos_de_diagnostico_y_mejora","309120076_Learning_and_teaching_styles_in_engineering_education_Engr","329759142_Intelligent_tutoring_systems_a_systematic_review_of_characteristics_applications_and_evaluation_methods","304260066_Learning_styles_and_perceptions_of_student_teachers_of_computer-supported_collaborative_learning_strategy_using_wikis","288069444_The_Myers-Briggs_Personality_Type_and_Its_Relationship_to_Computer_Programming","279764849_Development_of_an_Adaptive_Learning_System_with_Multiple_Perspectives_based_on_Students'_Learning_Styles_and_Cognitive_Styles","258629015_Quizzing_in_Middle-School_Science_Successful_Transfer_Performance_on_Classroom_Exams","258111954_An_adaptation_algorithm_for_an_intelligent_natural_language_tutoring_system","247926369_A_model_of_virtual_university_-_some_problems_during_its_development","273040837_Integrating_learning_styles_and_adaptive_e-learning_system_Current_developments_problems_and_opportunities"]}
