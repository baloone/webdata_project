{"id":"330817192_What_type_of_domain_knowledge_is_cited_by_articles_with_high_interdisciplinary_degree","abstract":"Interdisciplinary studies require integration of principles, theories and practices from multiple disciplines. What type of domain knowledge will be applied more in such researches? Since scientific paradigms differ in fields, this paper takes computer science (CS) as a case and investigates utilization patterns of CS knowledge in articles from PLOS One with high interdisciplinary degree (IDD) by citation content analysis. Since scholars usually organize and indicate used knowledge in methodology, we study articles which cite CS articles in this section. After extracting citation content from citing articles, we identify the cited knowledge and analyse the type of cited knowledge. Experimental results show that: In the PLOS One articles which cited the CS knowledge, algorithm is the most used knowledge type and the most used object is random forests. Our study can be applied to understand how articles with high IDD use the knowledge from other disciplines in the future.","authors":["Yuzhuo Wang","Chengzhi Zhang"],"meta":["January 2018Proceedings of the Association for Information Science and Technology 55(1):919-921","DOI:10.1002/pra2.2018.14505501176"],"references":["272200982_Diversity_of_references_as_an_indicator_of_the_interdisciplinarity_of_journals_Taking_similarity_between_subject_fields_into_account","261566649_The_dynamics_of_interdisciplinary_research_fields_The_case_of_river_research","250198785_Interdisciplinary_dynamics_of_modern_science_Analysis_of_cross-disciplinary_citation_flows","225059812_Measuring_diversity_The_importance_of_species_similarity","289501849_Interdisciplinary_topics_of_information_science_a_study_based_on_the_terms_interdisciplinarity_index_series"]}
