{"id":"280104813_Teaching_Logic_to_Information_Systems_Students_Challenges_and_Opportunities","abstract":"In contrast to Computer Science, where the fundamental role of Logic is\nwidely recognized, it plays a practically non-existent role in Information\nSystems curricula. In this paper we argue that instead of Logic's exclusion\nfrom the IS curriculum, a significant adaptation of the contents, as well as\nteaching methodologies, is required for an alignment with the needs of IS\npractitioners. We present our vision for such adaptation and report on concrete\nsteps towards its implementation in the design and teaching of a course for\ngraduate IS students at the University of Haifa. We discuss the course plan and\npresent some data on the students' feedback on the course.","authors":["Anna Zamansky","Eitan Farchi"],"meta":["July 2015","SourcearXiv"],"references":["265875391_Integrating_Formal_Methods_into_Computer_Science_Curricula_at_a_University_of_Applied_Science","247935033_IS_2010_Curriculum_Guidelines_for_Undergraduate_Degree_Programs_in_Information_Systems","228712066_Setting_the_stage_for_computing_curricula_2013_Computer_science_-_Report_from_the_ACMIEEE-CS_joint_task_force","224262740_Practical_relevance_of_experiments_in_comprehensibility_of_requirements_specifications","284894418_Bridging_intuitive_and_analytical_thinking_Four_looks_at_the_2-glass_puzzle","253552933_Sets_Logic_and_Maths_for_Computing","237243293_Weaving_formal_methods_into_the_undergraduate_computer_science_curriculum","225035649_Foundations_of_Computer_Science","224001287_An_Introduction_to_Formal_Specification_Using_Z","221241287_Software_is_Discrete_Mathematics"]}
