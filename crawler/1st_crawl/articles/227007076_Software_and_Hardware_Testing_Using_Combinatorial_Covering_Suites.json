{"id":"227007076_Software_and_Hardware_Testing_Using_Combinatorial_Covering_Suites","abstract":"In the 21st century our society is becoming more and more dependent on software systems. The safety of these systems and the quality\nof our lives is increasingly dependent on the quality of such systems. A key element in the manufacture and quality assurance\nprocess in software engineering is the testing of software and hardware systems. The construction of efficient combinatorial\ncovering suites has important applications in the testing of hardware and software. In this paper we define the general problem,\ndiscuss the lower bounds on the size of covering suites, and give a series of constructions that achieve these bounds asymptotically.\nThese constructions include the use of finite field theory, extremal set theory, group theory, coding theory, combinatorial\nrecursive techniques, and other areas of computer science and mathematics. The study of these combinatorial covering suites\nis a fascinating example of the interplay between pure mathematics and the applied problems generated by software and hardware\nengineers. The wide range of mathematical techniques used, and the often unexpected applications of combinatorial covering\nsuites make for a rewarding study.","authors":["Alan Hartman"],"meta":["March 2006Operations Research/ Computer Science Interfaces Series 34(3):237-266","DOI:10.1007/0-387-25036-0_10","In book: Graph Theory, Combinatorics and Algorithms (pp.237-266)"],"references":["323156212_Calculations_for_Bertrand's_Postulate","270634052_Foundations_of_Probability","268861987_Foundations_of_probability_Reprint_of_1970_edition","262426372_Rendezvous_Search_on_the_Line","262286444_Determination_of_Test_Configurations_for_Pair-Wise_Interaction_Coverage","248841632_Further_Results_on_the_Construction_of_Mutually_Orthogonal_Latin_Squares_and_the_Falsity_of_Euler's_Conjecture","247620347_Sperner_Families_and_Partitions_of_A_Partially_Ordered_Set","247042948_On_the_Maximal_Number_of_Pairwise_Orthogonal_Latin_Squares_of_a_Given_Order","246831623_Minimax_Rendezvous_on_the_Line","245489566_ARIANE_5_Flight_501_Failure_Report_by_the_Enquiry_Board"]}
