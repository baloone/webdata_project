{"id":"314256972_Turning_High-Dimensional_Optimization_Into_Computationally_Expensive_Optimization","abstract":"Divide-and-Conquer (DC) is conceptually well suited to deal with high-dimensional optimization problems by decomposing the original problem into multiple low-dimensional sub-problems, and tackling them separately. Nevertheless, the dimensionality mismatch between the original problem and subproblems makes it non-trivial to precisely assess the quality of a candidate solution to a sub-problem, which has been a major hurdle for applying the idea of DC to non-separable highdimensional optimization problems. In this paper, we suggest that searching a good solution to a sub-problem can be viewed as a computationally expensive problem and can be addressed with the aid of meta-models. As a result, a novel approach, namely Self-Evaluation Evolution (SEE) is proposed. Empirical studies have shown the advantages of SEE over 4 representative compared algorithms increase with the problem size on the CEC2010 large scale global optimization benchmark. The weakness of SEE is also analysed in the empirical studies.","authors":["Peng Yang","Ke Tang","Xin Yao"],"meta":["February 2017IEEE transactions on neural networks / a publication of the IEEE Neural Networks Council PP(99):1-1","DOI:10.1109/TEVC.2017.2672689"],"references":["295834096_Adaptive_multi-context_cooperatively_coevolving_particle_swarm_optimization_for_large-scale_problems","284178898_A_Competitive_Divide-and-Conquer_Algorithm_for_Unconstrained_Large_Scale_Black-Box_Optimization","279057607_Meta-Heuristic_Algorithms_in_Car_Engine_Design_A_Literature_Survey","313347879_Analysis_of_Recombinative_Algorithms_on_a_Non-Separable_Building-Block_Problem","313108693_Acooperative_coevolutionary_approach_to_function_optimization","305685501_Breaking_the_Billion-Variable_Barrier_in_Real-World_Optimization_Using_a_Customized_Evolutionary_Algorithm","305160245_Toward_Large-Scale_Continuous_EDA_A_Random_Matrix_Theory_Perspective","304786585_Bayesian_optimization_in_a_billion_dimensions_via_random_embeddings","293043220_Evolutionary_algorithms_for_large-scale_global_optimisation_a_snapshot_trends_and_challenges","280848340_Evolution_Strategies"]}
