{"id":"242932912_A_Traffic_Equilibrium_Model_of_Travel_by_Car_and_Public_Transit_Modes","abstract":"The salient features of the model developed are the clear distinction between the flow of vehicles and flow of transit passengers and the means of modeling the interaction that occurs between pivate cars and public transit vehicles that use the same road links of the network. Two classes of model structures for representing the demand for each mode of travel are analyzed. Data requirements and computational aspects are discussed in detail. A variety of applications are outlined.","authors":["Michael Florian"],"meta":["May 1977Transportation Science 11(2):166-179","DOI:10.1287/trsc.11.2.166"],"references":["246567598_Iterative_Solution_of_Nonlinear_Equations_in_Several_Variables","245534996_Some_Theoretical_Aspects_of_Road_Traffic_Research","230595730_Studies_in_Economics_of_Transportation","34671324_Mathematical_programming_algorithms_for_large_scale_network_equilibrium_and_network_design_problems"]}
