{"id":"223001960_A_characterization_of_partial_metrizability_Domains_are_quantifiable","abstract":"A characterization of partial metrizability is given which provides a partial solution to an open problem stated by Künzi in the survey paper Non-symmetric Topology (in: Proceedings of the Szekszard Conference, Bolyai Soc. Math. Studies, Vol. 4, 1993, pp. 303-338; problem 71). The characterization yields a powerful tool which establishes a correspondence between partial metrics and special types of valuations, referred to as Q-valuations (cf. also Theoret. Comput. Sci., to appear). The notion of a Q-valuation essentially combines the well-known notion of a valuation with a weaker version of the notion of a quasi-unimorphism, i.e. an isomorphism in the context of quasi-uniform spaces. As an application, we show that ω-continuous directed complete partial orders (dcpos) are quantifiable in the sense of O'Neill (in: S. Andima et al. (Eds.), Proceedings of the 11th Summer Conference on General Topology and Applications, Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, Vol. 86, 1997, pp. 304-315), i.e. the Scott topology and partial order are induced by a partial metric. For ω-algebraic dcpos the Lawson topology is induced by the associated metric. The partial metrization of general domains improves prior approaches in two ways:","authors":["Michel Schellekens"],"meta":["August 2003Theoretical Computer Science 305(1-3):409-432","DOI:10.1016/S0304-3975(02)00705-3","Sourcedx.doi.org"],"references":["266882606_ESSLLI_2000_Lecture_Notes_Computability_and_Complexity_from_a_Programming_Perspective","242793128_The_Smyth_Completion","228568988_Extendible_spaces","221443275_Semantics_of_Exact_Real_Arithmetic","2845934_Duality_and_Quasi-Normability_for_Complexity_Spaces","2458721_Quasi-metrics_and_Fixed_Points_in_Computing","277065078_Probabilistic_Non-Determinism","270151777_Topology_and_Order","268041138_Uniform_lattices_II_Order_continuity_and_exhaustivity","268018700_Quasi-Uniform_Spaces","266829381_Uniform_lattices_I_A_generalization_of_topological_Riesz_spaces_and_topological_Boolean_rings","266220170_Nonsymmetric_topology","265568165_Completeness_of_Quasi-Uniform_and_Syntopological_Spaces","264859630_Topology_and_Order","263561177_Complexity_and_computability_from_a_programming_language_perspective","262348269_Totally_bounded_spaces_and_compact_ordered_spaces_as_domains_of_computation","261857656_The_Smyth-completion_of_a_quasi-uniform_space","247341617_QuasiUniform_Completeness_In_Terms_Of_Cauchy_Nets","244441651_Semantics_of_Programming_Languages_Programming_Techniques","243767060_Algebraic_Theory_of_Lattices","243765773_Valuations_on_continuous_lattices","228766529_Spaces_of_Valuations","228527433_Complexity_spaces_revisited","227974229_Weighted_Quasi-Metrics","227656324_Partial_Metric_Topology","227183993_C-complete_quasi-uniform_spaces","226476593_On_the_semantics_of_logic_programming_languages","226299199_Uniform_lattices","225506956_The_asymmetric_topology_of_Computer_Science","223052592_The_Smyth_Completion_A_Common_Foundation_for_Denotational_Semantics_and_Complexity_Analysis","222648611_The_essence_of_ideal_completion_in_quantitative_form","222181279_On_the_Yoneda_completion_of_a_quasi-metric_space","222181140_The_correspondence_between_partial_metrics_and_semivaluations","221570108_Partial_Metrics_and_Co-continuous_Valuations","220909733_Quasi_Uniformities_Reconciling_Domains_with_Metric_Spaces","220909721_The_Asymmetric_Topology_of_Computer_Science","220800051_Towards_Computing_Distances_Between_Programs_via_Scott_Domains","220154993_An_Extensional_Treatment_of_Lazy_Data_Flow_Deadlock","220153253_Continuity_Spaces_Reconciling_Domains_and_Metric_Spaces","220148511_Generalized_Metric_Spaces_Completion_Topology_and_Powerdomains_via_the_Yoneda_Embedding","3561058_Domain_Theory_and_Integration","3501211_Probabilistic_powerdomain_of_evaluations","2862740_On_Upper_Weightable_Spaces","2860758_Complexity_Spaces_Lifting_Directedness","2853596_Quasi-metric_Properties_of_Complexity_Spaces","2785856_The_Semantics_of_Types_in_Programming_Languages","2781446_Quasi-Uniform_Completeness_In_Terms_Of_Cauchy_Nets","2513449_Approximation_of_Metric_Spaces_by_Partial_Metric_Spaces","2451475_Lower_Bag_Domains"]}
