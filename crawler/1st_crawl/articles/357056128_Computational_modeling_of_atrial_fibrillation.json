{"id":"357056128_Computational_modeling_of_atrial_fibrillation","abstract":"With the aging society, the prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) continues to increase. Nevertheless, there are still limitations in antiarrhythmic drugs (AAD) or catheter interventions for AF. If it is possible to predict the outcome of AF management according to various AADs or ablation lesion sets through computational modeling, it will be of great clinical help. AF computational modeling has been utilized for in-silico arrhythmia research and enabled high-density entire chamber mapping, reproducible condition control, virtual intervention, not possible clinically or experimentally, in-depth mechanistic research. With the recent development of computer science and technology, more sophisticated and faster computational modeling has become available for clinical application. In particular, it can be applied to determine the extra-PV target of persistent AF catheter ablation or to select the AAD with the best effect. AF computational modeling combined with artificial intelligence is expected to contribute to precision medicine for more diverse uses in the future. Therefore, in this review, we will deal with the history, development, and various applications of computation modeling.","authors":["Oh-Seok Kwon","Inseok Hwang","Hui-Nam Pak"],"meta":["December 2021International Journal of Arrhythmia 22(1)","DOI:10.1186/s42444-021-00051-x"],"references":["351671220_Machine_learning-accelerated_computational_fluid_dynamics","351558346_Computational_Modeling_for_Antiarrhythmic_Drugs_for_Atrial_Fibrillation_According_to_Genotype","339208779_In_situ_procedure_for_high-efficiency_computational_modeling_of_atrial_fibrillation_reflecting_personal_anatomy_fiber_orientation_fibrosis_and_electrophysiology","337975842_Clinical_Usefulness_of_Computational_Modeling-Guided_Persistent_Atrial_Fibrillation_Ablation_Updated_Outcome_of_Multicenter_Randomized_Study","346271099_Atrial_fibrillation_and_the_risk_of_ischaemic_strokes_or_intracranial_haemorrhages_comparisons_of_the_catheter_ablation_medical_therapy_and_non-atrial_fibrillation_population","345977029_Less_dementia_after_catheter_ablation_for_atrial_fibrillation_a_nationwide_cohort_study","339611246_Simultaneous_Endocardial_and_Epicardial_Delineation_of_3D_Reentrant_Ventricular_Tachycardia","337812798_The_surgical_treatment_of_atrial_fibrillation","336694692_P1027The_risk_of_dementia_and_catheter_ablation_for_atrial_fibrillation_a_nationwide_cohort_study","335924174_Targeted_Ablation_of_Ventricular_Tachycardia_Guided_by_Wavefront_Discontinuities_During_Sinus_Rhythm_A_New_Functional_Substrate_Mapping_Strategy"]}
