{"id":"341715907_Explosive_Higher-Order_Kuramoto_Dynamics_on_Simplicial_Complexes","abstract":"The higher-order interactions of complex systems, such as the brain, are captured by their simplicial complex structure and have a significant effect on dynamics. However, the existing dynamical models defined on simplicial complexes make the strong assumption that the dynamics resides exclusively on the nodes. Here we formulate the higher-order Kuramoto model which describes the interactions between oscillators placed not only on nodes but also on links, triangles, and so on. We show that higher-order Kuramoto dynamics can lead to an explosive synchronization transition by using an adaptive coupling dependent on the solenoidal and the irrotational component of the dynamics.","authors":["Ana Paula Millán Vidal","Joaquín J Torres","Ginestra Bianconi"],"meta":["May 2020Physical Review Letters 124(21)","DOI:10.1103/physrevlett.124.218301"],"references":["339634639_Abrupt_phase_transition_of_epidemic_spreading_in_simplicial_complexes","336163220_Topological_phase_transitions_in_functional_brain_networks","335449684_Explosive_phenomena_in_complex_networks","333642405_Simplicial_models_of_social_contagion","328241551_Simplicial_complexes_and_complex_systems","323622973_A_Graph_Signal_Processing_Perspective_on_Functional_Brain_Imaging","323302383_Simplicial_Closure_and_Higher-order_Link_Prediction","322886250_Complex_Network_Geometry_and_Frustrated_Synchronization","321095111_Hidden_geometries_in_networks_arising_from_cooperative_self-assembly","320878917_Weak_correlations_between_hemodynamic_signals_and_ongoing_neural_activity_during_the_resting_state","317594470_Cliques_of_Neurons_Bound_into_Cavities_Provide_a_Missing_Link_between_Structure_and_Function","316618043_Dynamic_interdependence_and_competition_in_multilayer_networks","313465896_Emergent_Hyperbolic_Network_Geometry","290028692_Two's_company_three_or_more_is_a_simplex_Algebraic-topological_tools_for_understanding_higher-order_structure_in_neural_data","284097162_Network_geometry_with_flavor_From_complexity_to_quantum_geometry","281487297_Interdisciplinary_and_physics_challenges_of_Network_Theory","269417830_Emergent_Complex_Network_Geometry","267512525_Homological_scaffolds_of_brain_functional_networks","266856643_Explosive_Synchronization_in_Adaptive_and_Multilayer_Networks","253339936_Random_network_peristalsis_in_Physarum_polycephalum_organizes_fluid_flows_across_an_individual","233872747_Influence_of_network_topology_on_sound_propagation_in_granular_materials","51247332_Multistable_Attractors_in_a_Network_of_Phase_Oscillators_with_Three-Body_Interactions","51074354_Explosive_Synchronization_Transitions_in_Scale-Free_Networks","49820957_Structural_Properties_of_the_Caenorhabditis_elegans_Neuronal_Network","41111573_Rules_for_Biologically_Inspired_Adaptive_Network_Design","26720899_Line_Graphs_Link_Partitions_and_Overlapping_Communities","5254952_Mapping_the_Structural_Core_of_Human_Cerebral_Cortex","338201004_Simplicial_SIS_model_in_scale-free_uniform_hypergraph","333883865_Abrupt_Desynchronization_and_Extensive_Multistability_in_Globally_Coupled_Oscillator_Simplexes","331050666_Synchronization_in_network_geometries_with_finite_spectral_dimension","329293498_Simplicial_Activity_Driven_Model","329112398_Topological_percolation_on_hyperbolic_simplicial_complexes","308896237_Explosive_transitions_in_complex_networks'_structure_and_dynamics_Percolation_and_synchronization","303682016_Chaos_in_generically_coupled_phase_oscillator_networks_with_nonpairwise_interactions","301856949_Generalized_network_structures_The_configuration_model_and_the_canonical_ensemble_of_simplicial_complexes","259107470_Multiplicity_of_Singular_Synchronous_States_in_the_Kuramoto_Model_of_Coupled_Oscillators","235737525_Self-entrainment_of_a_population_of_coupled_non-linear_oscillators","51951022_Spectra_of_combinatorial_Laplace_operators_on_simplicial_complexes","44687459_Link_Communities_Reveal_Multiscale_Complexity_in_Networks"]}
