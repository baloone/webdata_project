{"id":"327981453_A_Fuzzy-Euclidean_Intelligent_Fitness_Model_FEIFM_Implementation_for_Selecting_Personal_Vehicle","abstract":"Freshly, intelligent model is a computer science sub-domain that has been practically realized in numerous parts of real life. One of them, it is possibly able to be exploited by consumers of automotive industry to select the most suitable personal vehicle for their purposefulness. In this study, the suitability is defined by ten selected consumer parameters which depict consumer's personality. By using the combination of methods fuzzy logic and Euclidean distance, the consumer personality tried to be fitted with seven vehicle attributes. Finally, the intelligent model for selecting personal vehicle was successfully constructed based on object oriented approach. The result of simulation of 76 consumers and 22 possible vehicles is able to propose the most proper vehicle for each definitive consumer.","authors":["Inayatulloh Inayatulloh","Lingga Pratama","Faninda nurul Fatia","Muhammad Yusuf Firstra Efendi"],"meta":["September 2018","DOI:10.1109/INAPR.2018.8627021","Conference: 1st Indonesian Association for Pattern Recognition International Conference 2018At: Jakarta, Indonesia","Project: DSS and Corporate IS"],"references":["315593158_DT_An_Euclidean_Distance_Optimization_based_Intelligent_Donation_System_Model_for_Solving_the_Community's_Problem","311409157_F-multicriteria_based_Decision_Support_System_for_Road_Repair_and_Maintenance_Case_Study_Three_Areas_in_Tangerang_Selatan_Province_Banten_Indonesia","325639297_Multi-material_adhesive_joints_for_automotive_industry","325331425_Multi-Criteria_Decision_Support_System_with_Negotiation_Process_for_Vehicle_Technology_Selection","323848840_The_influence_of_reputation_on_supplier_selection_An_empirical_study_of_the_European_automotive_industry","323844647_Multi-criteria_decision_analysis_framework_for_sustainable_manufacturing_in_automotive_industry","321341791_Improvement_in_impact_strength_of_composite_joints_for_the_automotive_industry","320341952_Analysis_and_optimisation_of_a_logistic_warehouse_in_the_automotive_industry","312916717_Image_not_environmentalism_A_qualitative_exploration_of_factors_influencing_vehicle_purchasing_decisions","296060111_Quantifying_the_explanatory_power_of_mobility-related_attributes_in_explaining_vehicle_ownership_decisions"]}
