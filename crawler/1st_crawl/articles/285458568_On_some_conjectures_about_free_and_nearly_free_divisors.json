{"id":"285458568_On_some_conjectures_about_free_and_nearly_free_divisors","abstract":"In this paper infinite families of examples of irreducible free and nearly\nfree curves in the complex projective plane which are not rational curves and\nwhose local singularites can have an arbitrary number of branches are given.\nAll these examples answer negatively to some conjectures proposed by A. Dimca\nand G. Sticlaru. Our examples say nothing about the most remarkable conjecture\nby A. Dimca and G. Sticlaru, i.e. every rational cuspidal plane curve is either\nfree or nearly free.","authors":["Enrique Artal-Bartolo","Leire Gorrochategui","Ignacio Luengo Velasco","Alejandro Melle-Hern√°ndez"],"meta":["November 2015","SourcearXiv"],"references":["280589890_On_fundamental_groups_of_plane_curve_complements","259915235_Syzygies_and_logarithmic_vector_fields_along_plane_curves","243114214_Zariski_pairs_fundamental_groups_and_Alexander_polynomials","242353337_Rational_Cuspidal_Plane_Curves_of_Type_dd_-_3","319542067_Erratum_Free_divisors_in_a_pencil_of_curves_MR3370110","307897770_Freeness_of_conic-line_arrangements_in_P2","281119805_Freeness_versus_maximal_global_Tjurina_number_for_plane_curves","267066727_Construction_of_plane_curves_with_cusps","257200903_Invariants_and_rigidity_of_projective_hypersurfaces","238950869_The_local_cohomology_of_the_jacobian_ring"]}
