{"id":"267677453_Generalized_trial_division","abstract":"We propose an algorithm for factoring any integer N. This special-purpose algorithm will factor a number N efficiently if there exist a positive integer k such that k times any prime factor of N is close to N. It will be improved by using nested squares polynomials. Indeed, under an assumption about nested squares polynomials, this algorithm becomes a general-purpose algorithm with sub-exponential or polynomial running time.","authors":["Murat Sahin"],"meta":["January 2011"],"references":["239060590_Prime_Numbers_A_Computational_Perspective","220426448_A_Method_for_Obtaining_Digital_Signatures_and_Public-Key_Cryptosystems","220426289_A_Method_for_Obtaining_Digital_Signatures_and_Public-Key_Cryptosystems","2437232_A_Survey_of_Modern_Integer_Factorization_Algorithms"]}
