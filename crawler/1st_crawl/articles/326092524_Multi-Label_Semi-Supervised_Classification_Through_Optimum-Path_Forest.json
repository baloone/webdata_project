{"id":"326092524_Multi-Label_Semi-Supervised_Classification_Through_Optimum-Path_Forest","abstract":"Multi-label classification consists of assigning one or multiple\nclasses to each sample in a given dataset. However, the project of a\nmulti-label classifier is usually limited to a small number of\nsupervised samples as compared to the number of all possible label\ncombinations. This scenario favors semi-supervised learning methods,\nwhich can cope with the absence of supervised samples by adding\nunsupervised ones to the training set. Recently, we proposed a\nsemi-supervised learning method based on optimum connectivity for single-label classification. In this work, we extend it for\nmulti-label classification with considerable effectiveness gain. After\na single-label data transformation, the method propagates labels from supervised to\nunsupervised samples, as in the original approach, by assuming\nthat samples from the same class are more closely connected through\nsequences of nearby samples than samples from distinct classes. Given\nthat the procedure is more reliable in high-density regions of the\nfeature space, an additional step repropagates labels from the maxima\nof a probability density function to correct possible\nlabeling errors from the previous step. Finally, the data\ntransformation is reversed to obtain multiple labels per sample. The\nnew approach is experimentally validated on several datasets in\ncomparison with state-of-the-art methods.","authors":["Willian Paraguassu Amorim","Alexandre X Falcão","João Paulo Papa"],"meta":["June 2018Information Sciences 465","DOI:10.1016/j.ins.2018.06.067","Project: Learning with Optimum-Path Forest"],"references":["268747996_Semisupervised_Feature_Analysis_by_Mining_Correlations_Among_Multiple_Tasks","263813673_A_Review_On_Multi-Label_Learning_Algorithms","262408350_Effective_self-training_for_parsing","228536438_Supervised_Pattern_Classification_Using_Optimum-Path_Forest","221337742_Attributes_Reduction_Applied_to_Leather_Defects_Classification","220602651_Efficient_supervised_optimum-path_forest_classification_for_large_datasets","220320403_Large_scale_transductive_SVMs","7455289_Gene_identification_in_novel_eukaryotic_genomes_by_self-training_algorithm","4350997_Semi-Supervised_Discriminant_Analysis_using_robust_path-based_similarity","305882729_Pattern_Recognition_Letters_Optimum-Path_Forest_based_on_k-connectivity_Theory_and_Applications","304006743_ML-Forest_A_Multi-label_Tree_Ensemble_Method_for_Multi-Label_Classification","303438888_Improving_Semi-Supervised_Learning_through_Optimum_Connectivity","287418717_An_improved_multi-label_lazy_learning_approach","286668561_Semi-supervised_Pattern_Classification_Using_Optimum-Path_Forest","267572565_A_nature-inspired_approach_to_speed_up_optimum-path_forest_clustering_and_its_application_to_intrusion_detection_in_computer_networks","265170570_Regularized_extreme_learning_machine_for_multi-view_semi-supervised_action_recognition","261054609_A_Multiple_Labeling-Based_Optimum-Path_Forest_for_Video_Content_Classification","232628841_An_extensive_experimental_comparison_of_methods_for_multi-label_learning","230866423_Brain_Tissue_MR-Image_Segmentation_via_Optimum-Path_Forest_Clustering","222427752_Robust_path-based_spectral_clustering","220939216_Semi-Supervised_Self-Training_of_Object_Detection_Models","220845317_A_New_Variant_of_the_Optimum-Path_Forest_Classifier","220320196_Statistical_Comparisons_of_Classifiers_over_Multiple_Data_Sets","220319905_Manifold_Regularization_A_Geometric_Framework_for_Learning_from_Labeled_and_Unlabeled_Examples","38368280_A_Comparison_of_Alternative_Tests_of_Significance_for_the_Problem_of_m_Rankings","4246280_Correlated_Label_Propagation_with_Application_to_Multi-label_Learning","2543302_Knowledge_Discovery_in_Multi-Label_Phenotype_Data"]}
