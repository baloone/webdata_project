{"id":"263856259_Counting_and_Testing_Dominant_Polynomials","abstract":"In this paper, we concentrate on counting and testing dominant polynomials\nwith integer coefficients. A polynomial is called dominant if it has a simple\nroot whose modulus is strictly greater than the moduli of its remaining roots.\nIn particular, our results imply that the probability that the dominant root\nassumption holds for a random monic polynomial with integer coefficients tends\nto 1 in some setting. However, for arbitrary integer polynomials it does not\ntend to 1. For instance, the proportion of dominant quadratic integer\npolynomials of height $H$ among all quadratic integer polynomials tends to\n$(41+6 \\log 2)/72$ as $H \\to \\infty$. Finally, we will design some algorithms\nto test whether a given polynomial with integer coefficients is dominant or not\nwithout finding the polynomial roots.","authors":["ArtÅ«ras Dubickas","Min Sha"],"meta":["July 2014Experimental Mathematics 24(3)","DOI:10.1080/10586458.2014.992080","SourcearXiv"],"references":["286363963_Distribution_of_polynomials_with_bounded_roots_II_Polynomials_with_integer_coefficients","265040786_On_the_distribution_of_polynomials_with_bounded_roots_I_Polynomials_with_real_coefficients","321526426_Algorithmic_Algebra","309348889_How_Many_Zeros_of_a_Random_Polynomial_are_Real","266859592_Polynomial_root_separation_in_terms_of_the_Remak_height","266360363_Irreducible_polynomials_with_many_roots_of_equal_modulus","265859827_Generalized_radix_representations_and_dynamical_systems_IV","265333166_Diophantine_approximation_on_linear_algebraic_groups_Transcendence_properties_of_the_exponential_function_in_several_variables","265313864_Polynomials_An_Algorithmic_Approach","263913724_POLYNOMIAL_ROOT_SEPARATION"]}
