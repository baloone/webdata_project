{"id":"310835123_Design_and_Simulation_of_the_Robust_ABS_and_ESP_Fuzzy_Logic_Controller_on_the_Complex_Braking_Maneuvers","abstract":"Automotive driving safety systems such as an anti-lock braking system (ABS) and an electronic stability program (ESP) assist drivers in controlling the vehicle to avoid road accidents. In this paper, ABS and the ESP, based on the fuzzy logic theory, are integrated for vehicle stability control in complex braking maneuvers. The proposed control algorithm is implemented for a sport utility vehicle (SUV) and investigated for braking on different surfaces. The results obtained for the vehicle software simulator confirm the robustness of the developed control strategy for a variety of road profiles and surfaces.","authors":["Andrei Aksjonov","Klaus Augsburg","Valery Vodovozov"],"meta":["November 2016Applied Sciences 6(12):382","DOI:10.3390/app6120382"],"references":["308817801_Yaw_stability_control_for_in-wheel-motored_electric_vehicle_with_a_fuzzy_PID_method","281310341_A_review_of_fuzzy_methods_in_automotive_engineering_applications","308833610_Tracking_control_of_wheel_slip_ratio_with_velocity_estimation_for_vehicle_anti-lock_braking_system","304295896_The_Simulation_Research_of_Automobile_ABS_System_Based_on_Fuzzy_Theory","261500530_Research_on_Vehicle_Anti-braking_System_Control_Algorithm_Based_on_Fuzzy_Immune_Adaptive_PID_Control","261310943_A_new_approach_in_Anti-lock_Braking_System_ABS_based_on_adaptive_neuro-fuzzy_self-tuning_PID_controller","260712516_Intelligent_Hybrid_Control_System_Design_for_Antilock_Braking_Systems_Using_Self-Organizing_Function-Link_Fuzzy_Cerebellar_Model_Articulation_Controller","255985234_A_novel_driver_assist_stability_system_for_all-wheel-drive_Electric_Vehicles","251899938_Self-tuning_fuzzy_PID_applied_to_direct_yaw_moment_control_for_vehicle_stability","250715202_An_Embedded_Fuzzy_Anti-Slippage_System_for_Heavy_Duty_Off_Road_Vehicles"]}
