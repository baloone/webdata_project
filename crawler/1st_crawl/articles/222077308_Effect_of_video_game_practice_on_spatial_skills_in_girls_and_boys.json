{"id":"222077308_Effect_of_video_game_practice_on_spatial_skills_in_girls_and_boys","abstract":"A study of the effect of video game practice on spatial abilities in girls and boys was carried out. Spatial performance, measured using two subtests of a computerized spatial skills battery, was significantly better in boys than in girls during pretest assessment. Subjects then practiced on an action video game, Marble Madness, or a computerized word game, Conjecture. Video game practice was significantly more effective than the word game in improving spatial performance on the posttest assessment; there was no significant interaction of gender with experimental treatment. However, video game practice was more effective for children who started out with relatively poor spatial skills. The pattern of results suggests that video games may be useful in equalizing individual differences in spatial skill performance, including those associated with gender.","authors":["Kaveri Subrahmanyam","Patricia Greenfield"],"meta":["March 1994Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology 15(1):13-32","DOI:10.1016/0193-3973(94)90004-3"],"references":["247117649_Action_video_games_and_informal_education_Effects_on_strategies_for_dividing_visual_attention","313438143_Cognitive_aspects_of_informal_education","313057008_Video_games_and_cognitive_skills","284106721_Process_analyses_of_spatial_aptitude","284089093_Computer_games_Environments_for_developing_spatial_cognition","274754501_Motivation_of_Video_Game_Players","261727742_Personality_Differences_Between_High_and_Low_Electronic_Video_Game_Users","256620277_Learning_and_transfer_in_everyday_cognition","246819209_Micro-Computer_Video_Games_and_Spatial_Visualisation_Acquisition","246052407_Emergence_and_Characterization_of_Sex_Differences_in_Spatial_Ability_A_Meta-Analysis","239535704_Thinking_in_action-_some_characteristics_of_practical_thought","235040065_Spatial_Ability_A_Review_and_Reanalysis_of_the_Correlational_Literature","234802204_How_interface_Design_Determines_Who_Has_Difficulty_Learning_to_Use_a_Text_Editor","234784437_Learning_to_Use_a_Text_Editor_Some_Learner_Characteristics_That_Predict_Success","234610479_Factors_Influencing_Sex_Differences_in_Spatial_Ability_during_Adolescence"]}
