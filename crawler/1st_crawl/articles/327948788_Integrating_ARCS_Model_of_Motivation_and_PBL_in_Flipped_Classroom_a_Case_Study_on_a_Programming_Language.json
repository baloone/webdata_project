{"id":"327948788_Integrating_ARCS_Model_of_Motivation_and_PBL_in_Flipped_Classroom_a_Case_Study_on_a_Programming_Language","abstract":"This study proposed a teaching model that integrates attention, relevance, confidence, and satisfaction (ARCS) model and problem-based learning (PBL) and applied the proposed model to a flipped classroom to improve learners' learning motivation and effectiveness. Proficiency in the C# program language was the learning objective in this study. For the experiment, students were assigned either to the control group that used the conventional teaching method or to the experimental group that used this study's flipped classroom method. The learning outcome levels of the two groups were assessed based on their pretest and posttest data. In addition, the students' learning motivation was discussed in terms of the four dimensions of ARCS. The results showed that regarding learning outcomes, the experimental group had a more significant improvement in their learning results than the control group did; the experimental group achieved significant results for every dimension in the questionnaire. Therefore, the learners gave a positive review of the flipped classroom model designed in this study.","authors":["Yi-Hsing Chang","An-Ching Song","Rong-Jyue Fang"],"meta":["September 2018Eurasia Journal of Mathematics, Science and Technology Education 14(12)","DOI:10.29333/ejmste/97187"],"references":["317420832_Improving_student_learning_in_an_introductory_programming_course_using_flipped_classroom_and_competency_framework","316915058_The_Flipped_C_Programming_Classroom_What_Students_Had_to_Say","304900887_The_Flipped_Classroom_Method_Lessons_Learned_from_Flipping_Two_Programming_Courses","297663593_Structuring_Flipped_Classes_with_Lightweight_Teams_and_Gamification","283096704_Flipped_Classroom_Strategies_for_CS_Education","281615870_Transitioning_from_traditional_to_problem-based_learning_in_management_education_the_case_of_a_frontline_manager_skills_development_programme","277658403_The_Effectiveness_of_the_Problem-Based_Learning_Teaching_Model_for_Use_in_Introductory_Chinese_Undergraduate_Medical_Courses_A_Systematic_Review_and_Meta-Analysis","238319032_Cognitive_Consequences_of_Programming_Instruction_Instruction_Access_and_Ability","221222871_Teaching_programming_to_beginners_Choosing_the_language_is_the_first_step","220425310_The_Case_for_Case_Studies_of_Programming_Problems","31597385_What_About_a_Simple_Language_Analyzing_the_Difficulties_in_Learning_to_Program","5516882_Learning_approaches_of_undergraduate_medical_students_to_physiology_in_a_non-PBL-_and_partially_PBL-oriented_curriculum","325088696_Flipping_the_Foundation_A_Multi-Year_Flipped_Classroom_Study_for_a_Large-Scale_Introductory_Programming_Course","322178362_Evaluating_Instructional_Effects_of_Flipped_Classroom_in_University_A_Case_Study_on_Electronic_Business_Course","321697683_A_improved_method_for_teaching_system_innovation_design_of_physical_education_major_in_colleges_based_on_flipped_classroom","317182777_A_Flipped_Classroom_Experience_Teaching_Software_Engineering","313690127_Using_flipped_classroom_approach_to_teach_computer_programming","313237848_Design_a_Civil_Engineering_Micro-lecture_Platform_based_on_the_ARCS_Model_Perspective","308863559_ARCS-based_tactics_to_improve_students'_motivation_in_computer_programming_course","308819787_Programming_education_for_primary_school_children_using_a_textual_programming_language","308525552_Millennial_students_and_the_flipped_classroom","303170761_The_classroom_flip_Using_Web_course_management_tools_to_become_the_guide_on_the_side","303124615_Flipped_Classroom_adapted_to_the_ARCS_Model_of_Motivation_and_applied_to_a_Physics_Course","285985052_Motivational_Design_for_Learning_and_Performance_The_ARCS_Model_Approach","283232545_Drop_Fail_Pass_Continue_Persistence_in_CS1_and_Beyond_in_Traditional_and_Inverted_Delivery","281894255_Designing_and_Evaluating_Digital_Game-Based_Learning_with_the_ARCS_Motivation_Model_Humor_and_Animation","279248408_A_Motivational_Analysis_of_the_ARCS_Model_for_Information_Literacy_Courses_in_a_Blended_Learning_Environment","246255758_From_Sage_on_the_Stage_to_Guide_on_the_Side","245968667_Problem-Based_Learning_A_Review_of_Literature_on_Its_Outcomes_and_Implementation_Issues","241737447_Promoting_Motivation_and_Learning","237628685_Do_They_Really_Think_Differently_Digital_Natives_Digital_Immigrants_Part_II","230876708_Problem-Based_Learning_An_Approach_to_Medical_Education","227505597_Influence_of_curriculum_type_on_student_performance_in_the_United_States_Medical_Licensing_Examination_Step_1_and_Step_2_exams_problem-based_learning_vs_lecture-based_curriculum","223585100_A_two-tier_test_approach_to_developing_location-aware_mobile_learning_system_for_natural_science_course","220426367_Learning_to_Program_and_Learning_to_Think_What's_the_Connection","14874949_Does_Problem-Based_Learning_Work_A_Meta-Analysis_of_Evaluative_Research"]}
