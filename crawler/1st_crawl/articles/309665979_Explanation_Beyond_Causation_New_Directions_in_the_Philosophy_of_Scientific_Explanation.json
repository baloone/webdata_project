{"id":"309665979_Explanation_Beyond_Causation_New_Directions_in_the_Philosophy_of_Scientific_Explanation","abstract":"In this paper, I aim to provide access to the current debate on non-causal explanations in philosophy of sciences. I will first present examples of non-causal explanations in the sciences. Then, I will outline three alternative approaches to non-causal explanations – that is, causal reductionism, pluralism and monism – and, corresponding to these three approaches, different strategies for distinguishing between causal and non-causal explanation. Finally, I will raise questions for future research on non-causal explanations.","authors":["Alexander Reutlinger"],"meta":["January 2016Philosophy Compass 12(2)","DOI:10.1111/phc3.12395"],"references":["283420101_Nature's_Capacities_and_their_Measurement","259709961_Scientific_Explanation_between_Principle_and_Constructive_Theories","240548010_Thinking_About_Mechanisms","227679246_A_Tale_of_Two_Vectors","220607646_Topological_Explanations_and_Robustness_in_Biological_Sciences","345828507_Is_There_A_Monist_Theory_of_Causal_and_Non-Causal_Explanations_The_Counterfactual_Theory_of_Scientific_Explanation","344486537_Laws_and_Symmetry","329915653_Some_Varieties_of_Non-Causal_Explanation","326941432_Searching_for_non-causal_explanations_in_a_sea_of_causes","326941337_The_non-causal_character_of_renormalization_group_explanations","326941330_Because_without_cause_scientific_explanations_by_constraint","326941289_Accommodating_explanatory_pluralism","326941247_The_development_and_application_of_efficient_coding_explanation_in_neuroscience","306297110_Complements_Not_Competitors_Causal_and_Mathematical_Explanations","305400829_Does_the_Counterfactual_Theory_of_Explanation_Apply_to_Non-Causal_Explanations_in_Metaphysics","302285450_Stability_Emergence_and_Part-Whole_Reduction","292173309_Why_things_happen","289396428_What's_Wrong_With_Microphysicalism","286260644_How_to_explain_the_Lorentz_transformations","282190885_The_interventionist_account_of_causation_and_non-causal_determination","280256218_Why_Is_There_Universal_Macro-Behavior_Renormalization_Group_Explanation_As_Non-causal_Explanation","279265725_On_Explanations_from_'Geometry_of_Motion'","275729968_Van_Fraassen_on_Explanation","275306291_Are_There_Non-Causal_Explanations_of_Particular_Events","275159135_Abstract_Explanations_in_Science","274484405_Aspects_of_Scientific_Explanation","274412756_What_Makes_a_Scientific_Explanation_Distinctively_Mathematical","272551190_Minimal_Model_Explanations","271732667_Reassessing_Woodward's_Account_of_Explanation_Regularities_Counterfactuals_and_Noncausal_Explanations","271157576_The_Nature_of_Explanation","269444433_Scientific_Explanation_and_the_Causal_Structure_of_the_World","268638822_The_Nature_of_Mathematical_Knowledge","265495663_Mathematics_and_Scientific_Representation","263210129_Minimal_models_and_canonical_neural_computations_The_distinctness_of_computational_explanation_in_neuroscience","262771677_How_dimensional_analysis_can_explain","261376270_A_Field_Guide_to_Mechanisms_Part_I","259713478_Really_Statistical_Explanations_and_Genetic_Drift","259709315_Conservation_Laws_in_Scientific_Explanations_Constraints_or_Coincidences","259554638_Moving_Beyond_Causes_Optimality_Models_and_Scientific_Explanation","257560592_The_Interventionist_Account_of_Causation_and_Non-causal_Association_Laws","254394630_Inference_To_the_Best_Explanation","247173807_Philosophical_Papers_Vol_1","246902943_Multiple_Realizability_and_Universality","243764129_Discovering_Complexity_Decomposition_and_Localization_as_Strategies_in_Scientific_Research","228009660_Dimensional_Explanations","227467296_Precis_of_Nature's_Capacities_and_Their_Measurement","51911030_On_Some_Explanations_in_Physics","50330885_The_Scientific_Image","41015742_Four_Decades_of_Scientific_Explanation","31171209_Can_Classical_Structures_Explain_Quantum_Phenomena","31122339_Mathematical_Explanation_in_Science"]}
