{"id":"303883356_Towards_a_formal_assessment_of_design_literacy_Analyzing_K-12_students'_stance_towards_inquiry","abstract":"Highlights:\n• We present an assessment tool for measuring aspects of design literacy.\n• Design and analysis of an open-ended survey item with wicked characteristics.\n• We assess student's stance towards inquiry as an aspect of design literacy.\n• We provide evidence for student's lack of a designerly stance toward inquiry.\n\nWe present a tool for quantitative assessment of K-12 students' stance towards inquiry as an important part of students' development of design literacy. On a basis of design thinking literature, we position designerly stance towards inquiry as a prerequisite for engaging with wicked problems. The Design Literacy (DeL) assessment tool contains design of a qualitative survey question, a coding scheme for assessing aspects of a designerly stance towards inquiry, and a description of how, we have validated the results through a large-scale survey administration in K-12 education. Our DeL tool is meant to provide educators, leaders, and policy makers with strong arguments for introducing design literacy in K-12 schools, which, we posit, function within in an age of measurement.\n\nKeywords:\ndesign education; design research; reflective practices; evaluation","authors":["Kasper Skov Christensen","Mikkel Hjorth","Ole Sejer Iversen","Paulo Blikstein"],"meta":["June 2016Design Studies In Press(Available online 8 June 2016)","DOI:10.1016/j.destud.2016.05.002","Project: FabLab@school.dk"],"references":["305208700_Digital_Technology_and_design_processes_Report_on_a_FabLabSchool_survey_among_Danish_youth","303093020_Impediments_to_Digital_Fabrication_in_Education_A_Study_of_Teachers'_Role_in_Digital_Fabrication","300490509_Learning_practices_of_making","288295454_Pragmatism_and_Design_Thinking","284103213_Design_thinking_for_digital_fabrication_in_education","281495128_Digital_Fabrication_and_'Making'_in_Education_The_The_Democratization_of_Invention","277790726_Design_and_Technology_Education_whose_design_whose_education_and_why","262691246_A_Theoretical_Basis_for_Recommending_the_Use_of_Design_Methodologies_as_Teaching_Strategies_in_the_Design_Studio","262173151_The_makers'_movement_and_FabLabs_in_education_experiences_technologies_and_research","256445970_Democratizing_Technology_Pleasure_Utility_and_Expressiveness_in_DIY_and_Maker_Practice","248606759_Reliability_and_validity_study_of_the_technology_proficiency_self-assessment_scale","228682372_Handbook_of_Research_on_New_Literacies","228600651_Fab_Lab_An_alternate_model_of_ICT_for_development","350261786_DIGITAL_FABRICATION_IN_EDUCATIONAL_CONTEXTS_IDEAS_FOR_A_CONSTRUCTIONIST_WORKSHOP_SETTING","342183905_A_Coefficient_of_Agreement_for_Nominal_Scales","329645326_Thoughtful_Interaction_Design_A_Design_Perspective_on_Information_Technology","304754619_Ethical_Technological_Literacy_as_Democratic_Curriculum_Keystone","303920029_Interactive_learning_assessments_for_the_21_st_century","303919820_Digital_fabricationin_educational_contexts-ideas_for_a_constructionist_workshop_setting","303919722_Learning_by_design_from_theory_to_practice","303918918_Towards_new_literacies_information_technology_English_and_media_education","300490579_Exploring_children's_designs_for_maker_technologies","284017775_I3_Imitation_Iteration_and_Improvisation_Embodied_Interaction_in_Making_and_Learning","278915971_Design","277876254_Assessment_of_technological_literacy_in_the_United_States","277855942_The_RCA_Study_'Design_in_General_Education'","275999518_Social_Linguistics_and_Literacies_Ideology_in_Discourses","273097098_Practical_Statistics_For_Medical_Research","271136227_Universal_Methods_of_Design_100_Ways_to_Research_Complex_Problems_Develop_Innovative_Ideas_and_Design_Effective_Solutions","267026691_ShrinkyCircuits_Sketching_shrinking_and_formgiving_for_electronic_circuits","266655695_Sketching_in_circuits_Designing_and_building_electronics_on_paper","262284727_21_st_century_assessment_redesigning_to_optimize_learning","262256725_Microcontrollers_as_material_Crafting_circuits_with_paper_conductive_ink_electronic_components_and_an_untoolkit","262187467_Cognitive_theory_of_multimedia_learning","260993621_Measuring_Critical_Components_of_Digital_Literacy_and_their_Relationships_with_Learning","259782629_The_Design_Way_Intentional_Change_in_an_Unpredictable_World","258173951_Measuring_users'_internet_skills_A_review_of_past_assessments_and_a_look_toward_the_future","256399526_Design_and_general_education","256399375_Design_education_on_the_road_towards_thought_development","251880135_New_tools_for_resolving_wicked_problems_Mess_mapping_and_resolution_mapping_processes","251880127_Wicked_Problems_in_Design_Thinking","251509541_Digital_learning_digital_scholarship_and_design_thinking","247701930_Intercultural_Adaptive_Expertise_Explicit_and_Implicit_Lessons_from_Dr_Hatano","246354966_Handbook_of_Applied_Multivariate_Statistics_and_Mathematical_Modeling","245154219_Towards_an_understanding_of_the_intrinsic_values_of_design_education","245153403_Limitations_in_the_decision_strategies_of_design_students","241299104_An_Update_on_Survey_Measures_of_Web-Oriented_Digital_Literacy","235700914_Design_Thinking_Understanding_How_Designers_Think_and_Work","232442684_Interrater_Reliability_and_Agreement","229088019_Learning_by_Design_from_theory_to_practice","228328529_Mindstorms_Children_Computers_and_Powerful_Ideas","226821553_Literacy_technology_and_'technological_literacy'","225978813_Output_Devices_Computation_and_the_Future_of_Mathematical_Crafts","224927665_Thoughtful_Interaction_Design_A_Design_Perspective_on_Information_Technology","223416599_Some_phenomena_of_problem_decomposition_strategy_for_design_thinking_Differences_between_novices_and_experts"]}
