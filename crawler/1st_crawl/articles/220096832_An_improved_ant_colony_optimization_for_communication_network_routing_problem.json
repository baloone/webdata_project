{"id":"220096832_An_improved_ant_colony_optimization_for_communication_network_routing_problem","abstract":"Ant colony optimization (ACO) is a population-based meta-heuristic for combinatorial optimization problems such as the communication network routing problem (CNRP). This paper proposes an improved ant colony optimization (IACO) technique, which adapts a new strategy to update the increased pheromone, called the ant-weight strategy, and a mutation operation, to solve the CNRP. The simulation results for a benchmark problem are reported and they are compared to the simple ant colony optimization (ACO) results.","authors":["Dongming Zhao","Liang Luo","Kai Zhang"],"meta":["December 2010Mathematical and Computer Modelling 52(11-12):1976-1981","DOI:10.1016/j.mcm.2010.04.021","SourceDBLP"],"references":["242916734_An_Improved_Ant_System_Algorithm_for_the_Vehicle_Routing_Problem","235439153_Ant_sytem_Optimization_by_a_colony_of_cooperating_agents","5589170_Ant_System_Optimization_by_a_colony_of_cooperating_agents_IEEE_Trans_Syst_Man_Cybernetics_-_Part_B","2318775_Ant-Based_Load_Balancing_in_Telecommunications_Networks","312907789_Ant_system_Optimization_by_a_colony_of_cooperating_agents","253789911_An_improved_ant_colony_system_algorithm_for_the_vehicle_routing_problem","246706829_Load_Balancing_in_Telecommunications_Network","222559848_A_review_of_routing_protocols_for_mobile_Ad_Hoc_networks","220373418_A_Parallel_Ant_Colony_Algorithm_for_Bus_Network_Optimization"]}
