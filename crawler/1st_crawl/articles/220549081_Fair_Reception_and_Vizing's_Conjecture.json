{"id":"220549081_Fair_Reception_and_Vizing's_Conjecture","abstract":"In this paper we introduce the concept of fair reception of a graph which is related to its domination number. We prove that all graphs G with a fair reception of size γ(G) satisfy Vizing's conjecture on the domination number of Cartesian product graphs, by which we extend the well-known result of Barcalkin and German concerning decomposable graphs. Combining our concept with a result of Aharoni, Berger and Ziv, we obtain an alternative proof of the theorem of Aharoni and Szabó that chordal graphs satisfy Vizing's conjecture. A new infinite family of graphs that satisfy Vizing's conjecture is also presented. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Graph Theory 61: 45-54, 2009","authors":["Boštjan Brešar,","Douglas F.
