{"id":"355079979_Assessment_of_Computational_Thinking_-_A_Croatian_Evidence-Centered_Design_model","abstract":"The new Croatian Informatics curriculum, which introduces computational thinking concepts into learning outcomes has been put into practice. A computational thinking assessment model reflecting the learning outcomes of the Croatian curriculum was created using an evidence-centered design approach. The possibility of assessing the computational thinking concepts, abstraction, decomposition, and algorithmic thinking, in an actual classroom situation and examples of such assessment is increasingly coming to the forefront of computer science educational research. Precisely for that purpose, the research was conducted. Research data are collected through the test and questionnaire of 407 pupils (10 middle schools, age 12), analysed by exploratory factor analysis and non-parametric tests. Results showed that the presented model was suitable to assess the understanding of the concepts of abstraction and algorithmic thinking, independently of the previous experience with programming languages and pupil's gender, while assessment of decomposition needs more work and improvement, some recommendations are provided. Also, it received positive feedback from pupils and teachers what implicated that such an assessment model could help teachers in building a real-time measurement instrument.","authors":["Nikolina Bubica","Ivica Boljat"],"meta":["October 2021Informatics in Education","DOI:10.15388/infedu.2022.17","Project: computational thinking in K12 curriculum"],"references":["339510443_Designing_an_Assessment_for_Introductory_Programming_Concepts_in_Middle_School_Computer_Science","339238220_A_conceptual_framework_for_teaching_computational_thinking_in_personalized_OERs","331302029_Development_of_a_Lean_Computational_Thinking_Abilities_Assessment_for_Middle_Grades_Students","317777374_The_Use_of_Cronbach's_Alpha_When_Developing_and_Reporting_Research_Instruments_in_Science_Education","317644528_Assessment_Design_Patterns_for_Computational_Thinking_Practices_in_Secondary_Computer_Science_A_First_Look","316446592_Computational_Thinking_in_Teacher_Education","290391277_COMPUTATIONAL_THINKING_TEST_DESIGN_GUIDELINES_AND_CONTENT_VALIDATION","282574384_Aprender_a_programar_'apps'_como_enriquecimiento_curricular_en_alumnado_de_alta_capacidad","343168295_Important_Considerations_for_Assessment_to_Function_in_the_Service_of_Education","321820711_Exploring_computational_thinking_assessment_in_introductory_programming_courses","281714025_Dr_Scratch_Automatic_Analysis_of_Scratch_Projects_to_Assess_and_Foster_Computational_Thinking","274309848_Computational_Thinking","267378468_Evidence-Centered_Assessment_Design_Layers_Structures_and_Terminology","281495676_The_Argument-Based_Approach_to_Validation","266562898_Review_on_teaching_and_learning_of_computational_thinking_through_programming_What_is_next_for_K-12"]}
