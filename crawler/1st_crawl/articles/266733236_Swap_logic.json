{"id":"266733236_Swap_logic","abstract":"We investigate dynamic modal operators that can change the model during evaluation. We define the logic S S L L by extending the basic modal language with the modality, which is a diamond operator that in addition has the ability to invert pairs of related elements in the domain\nwhile traversing an edge of the accessibility relation. S S L L is very expressive: it fails to have the finite and the tree model property. We show that S S L L is equivalent to a fragment of first-order logic by providing a satisfiability preserving translation. In addition, we provide\nan equivalence preserving translation from S S L L to the hybrid logic H H(:,↓ ). We also define a suitable notion of bisimulation for S S L L and investigate its expressive power, showing that it lies strictly between the basic modal logic and H H(:,↓ ). We finally show that its model checking problem is PSpace-complete and its satisfiability problem is undecidable.","authors":["Carlos Areces","Raul Fervari","Guillaume Hoffmann"],"meta":["April 2014Logic Journal of IGPL 22(2):309-332","DOI:10.1093/jigpal/jzt030","Project: Relation-Changing Logics"],"references":["260345515_Moving_Arrows_and_Four_Model_Checking_Results","259410399_The_Expressive_Power_of_Memory_Logics","228846948_Hybrid_Logics_The_Old_and_the_New","281327949_Modal_Memory_Logics","266524057_Modal_Logic","259810884_Dynamic_Epistemic_Logic","251467769_Hybrid_Logics","239665785_Cambridge_tracts_in_theoretical_computer_science","236628854_Computational_Complexity","232414404_Modal_Logic_A_Semantic_Perspective","226781235_Hybrid_Languages","221590198_The_Complexity_of_Relational_Query_Languages_Extended_Abstract","228057894_Computational_Complexity","225109703_An_Essay_on_Sabotage_and_Obstruction","221583315_Model_Checking_and_Satisfiability_for_Sabotage_Modal_Logic"]}
