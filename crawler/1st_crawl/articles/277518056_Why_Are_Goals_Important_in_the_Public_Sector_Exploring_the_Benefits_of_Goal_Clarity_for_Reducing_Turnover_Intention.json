{"id":"277518056_Why_Are_Goals_Important_in_the_Public_Sector_Exploring_the_Benefits_of_Goal_Clarity_for_Reducing_Turnover_Intention","abstract":"The influences of goal setting or goal properties on turnover intention have received relatively little attention from empirical\nresearch in public administration. This analysis connects goal properties, including organization-level goal ambiguity dimensions\n(target ambiguity, timeline ambiguity, and evaluation ambiguity) and individual-level perceptions of goal specificity and\nimportance with turnover intention. Using a type of hierarchical generalized linear modeling, this study empirically shows\nthe benefits of specifying and clarifying individual and organizational goals in public organizations as well as making public\nemployees perceive their job goals as important. The final section discusses theoretical contributions related to goal setting\nand goal ambiguity theories and the practical implications regarding human resource management policies.","authors":["Chan Su Jung"],"meta":["December 2012Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory 24(1):209-234","DOI:10.1093/jopart/mus058"],"references":["303609801_Social_Identity_Theory_and_the_Organization","292872837_Subjective_and_objective_measures_of_organizational_performance_An_empirical_exploration","275440340_Comparing_Public_and_Private_Organizations_Empirical_Research_and_the_Power_of_the_A_Priori","274583931_Research_Notes_Correcting_Turnover_Statistics_for_Comparative_Analysis","254734316_Building_a_Practically_Useful_Theory_of_Goal_Setting_and_Task_Motivation_A_35Year_Odyssey","249624944_Weeding_an_Old_GardenToward_a_New_Understanding_of_Organizational_Goals","239640787_Building_Organizational_Commitment_The_Socialization_of_Managers_in_Work_Organizations","233004011_Public_Managers'_Perceptions_of_Organizational_Goal_Ambiguity_Analyzing_Alternative_Models","324331766_Beyond_the_Hype_Rediscovering_the_Essence_of_Management","314590661_The_Motivational_Properties_of_Tasks","304214408_Goal-setting_theory_and_its_applications_to_the_world_of_business","303637211_Social_identity_organizations_and_leadership","289885508_Consequences_of_goal_ambiguity_in_public_organizations","287552789_Extending_goal_ambiguity_research_in_government_From_organizational_goal_ambiguity_to_programme_goal_ambiguity","284438999_The_Functions_of_the_Executive","282811448_Trust_and_incentives_in_principal-agent_negotiations_The_'insuranceincentive_trade-off'","279932087_A_Construct_Validity_Study_of_the_Survey_of_Perceived_Organizational_Support","275705465_Creating_Public_Value_Strategic_Management_in_Government","275697813_Effects_of_Coaction_Expected_Evaluation_and_Goal_Setting_on_Creativity_and_Productivity","275697386_Socialization_tactics_self-Efficacy_and_newcomers_adjustments_to_organizations","274509117_Developing_An_Interdisciplinary_Science_of_Organizations","274420782_The_Deadly_Sins_in_Public_Administration","274225377_A_Contextual_Model_of_Employee_Turnover_Intentions","271805906_The_Relationship_of_Inequity_to_Turnover_Among_Hourly_Workers","271767715_Overall_Job_Satisfaction_How_Good_Are_Single-Item_Measures","270390837_The_Dynamics_of_Bureaucracy_A_Study_of_Interpersonal_Relations_in_Two_Government_Agencies","269856495_The_Motivational_Properties_of_Tasks","269572900_The_Fifth_Discipline_-_The_Art_Practice_of_The_Learning_Organization","265219712_The_Motivational_Benefits_of_Goal-Setting","263118995_Disaggregating_the_Motives_Underlying_Turnover_Intentions_When_Do_Intentions_Predict_Turnover_Behavior","258122107_Developing_and_Validating_New_Concepts_and_Measures_of_Program_Goal_Ambiguity_in_the_US_Federal_Government","257467280_Data_analytic_methods_for_the_analysis_of_multilevel_questions_A_comparison_of_intraclass_correlation_coefficients_rwgj_hierarchical_linear_modeling_within-_and_between-analysis_and_random_group_resam","249697317_Job_Satisfaction_In_The_Public_Sector","249234309_The_Role_of_Work_Context_in_Work_Motivation_A_Public_Sector_Application_of_Goal_and_Social_Cognitive_Theories","247886677_Performance_Measurement_And_Dysfunction_The_Dark_Side_of_Quantifying_Work","247824142_The_Effect_of_Lengthening_Job_Tenure_on_Managers'_Organizational_Commitment_and_Turnover","247717378_Disaggregating_the_Motives_Underlying_Turnover_Intentions_When_Do_Intentions_Predict_Turnover_Behavior","247570187_Do_'High_Commitment'_Human_Resource_Practices_Affect_Employee_Commitment_A_Cross-Level_Analysis_Using_Hierarchical_Linear_Modeling","247524405_Job_Satisfaction_and_Intent_to_Leave","240697231_IT_Employee_Work_Exhaustion","240697199_A_Model_of_Voluntary_Turnover_in_State_Government","240276856_Single-Item_Reliability_A_Replication_and_Extension","239769268_Public_and_Private_Management_What's_the_Difference","239548970_Organization_work_and_personal_factors_in_employee_turnover_and_absenteeism","238433151_A_Postscript_on_Thinking_about_Dialogue","237440045_Goal_Ambiguity_and_Organizational_Performance_in_US_Federal_Agencies","232837504_Organizational_Goal_Ambiguity_and_Performance_Conceptualization_Measurement_and_Relationships","232827211_Predicting_Organizational_Actual_Turnover_Rates_in_the_US_Federal_Government","232587766_Improving_job_performance_through_training_in_goal_setting","232576294_Perceived_Organizational_Support_and_Employee_Diligence_Commitment_and_Innovation","232524329_A_Construct_Validity_Study_of_the_Survey_of_Perceived_Organizational_Support","232461038_Goal_setting_theory_and_job_performance","232528730_Research_strategies_and_tactics_in_industrial_and_organizational_psychology","232514371_Self-regulation_of_motivation_and_action_through_internal_standards_and_goal_systems","232434418_The_Forgotten_Variable_in_Conformity_Research_Impact_of_Task_Importance_on_Social_Influence"]}
