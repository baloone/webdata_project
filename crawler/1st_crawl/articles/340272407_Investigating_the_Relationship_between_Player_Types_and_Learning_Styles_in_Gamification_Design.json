{"id":"340272407_Investigating_the_Relationship_between_Player_Types_and_Learning_Styles_in_Gamification_Design","abstract":"An educational gamification is a new approach that has developed hopes to increase the effectiveness of learning. Computer game users are actually players that are categorized according to their personalities and have different learning styles. To achieve maximum performance in designing gamified learning, one can determine the relationship between player types and their learning styles, and then use this relationship to design better gamification in the field of education. In this research, the relationship between types of players based on Hexad scale model and the dimensions of Felder-Silverman Learning Style M odel (FSLSM) have been investigated. To this end, the research data were collected from 121 university students. After analyzing the results of the crosstab and Pearson's Chi-square test, five hypotheses were approved from ten developed hypotheses, which could be used to guide the more effective design of gamification elements.","authors":["Zahra Abdollahzade","Seyed Mohammadbagher Jafari"],"meta":["July 2018","DOI:10.22059/ijms.2018.256394.673107"],"references":["331731138_University_Students'_Learning_Styles_and_Their_Ability_to_Solve_Mathematical_Problems","326311784_Level_Up_Your_Strategy_Towards_a_Descriptive_Framework_for_Meaningful_Enterprise_Gamification","320234774_GAMIFICATION_IN_EDUCATION","318113063_Recommender_Systems_for_Personalized_Gamification","317687382_TOWARDS_ADAPTIVE_GAMIFICATION_A_SYNTHESIS_OF_CURRENT_DEVELOPMENTS","314435151_Towards_Personality-driven_Persuasive_Health_Games_and_Gamified_Systems","313872357_Gamifying_education_what_is_known_what_is_believed_and_what_remains_uncertain_a_critical_review","312470401_Learningteaching_styles_in_engineering_education","308083575_The_Gamification_User_Types_Hexad_Scale","312867851_Learning_Style_Identifier_Improving_the_Precision_of_Learning_Style_Identification_Through_Computational_Intelligence_Algorithms"]}
