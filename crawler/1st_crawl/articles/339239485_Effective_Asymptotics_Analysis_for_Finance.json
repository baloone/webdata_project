{"id":"339239485_Effective_Asymptotics_Analysis_for_Finance","abstract":"It is known that an adaptation of Newton’s method allows for the computation of functional inverses of formal power series. We show that it is possible to successfully use a similar algorithm in a fairly general analytical framework. This is well suited for functions that are highly tangent to identity and that can be expanded with respect to asymptotic scales of “exp-log functions”. We next apply our algorithm to various well-known functions coming from the world of quantitative finance. In particular, we deduce asymptotic expansions for the inverses of the Gaussian and the Black–Scholes pricing functions.","authors":["Cyril Grunspan","Joris van der Hoeven"],"meta":["February 2020International Journal of Theoretical and Applied Finance 23(4)","DOI:10.1142/S0219024920500132"],"references":["266366401_Automatic_asymptotics","337135469_Lie_symmetry_methods_for_local_volatility_models","319866387_Shapes_of_Implied_Volatility_with_Positive_Mass_at_Zero","315429802_Asymptotic_Expansions_of_the_Lognormal_Implied_Volatility_A_Model_Free_Approach","311160754_Uniform_Bounds_for_Black--Scholes_Implied_Volatility","305973094_Smile_Asymptotics_II_Models_with_Known_Moment_Generating_Functions","286264811_Heat_Kernel_Method_and_its_Applications","279902950_The_Constant_Elasticity_of_Variance_Option_Pricing_Model","267478460_Symbolic_Asymptotics","266990692_Large_deviations_and_asymptotic_methods_in_finance_to_appear","233358212_Small-Time_Asymptotics_for_an_Uncorrelated_Local-Stochastic_Volatility_Model","227624117_Asymptotics_and_Calibration_in_Local_Volatility_Models","246523838_Introduction_aux_fonctions_analysables_et_preuve_constructive_de_la_conjecture_de_Dulac","243554938_Asymptotique_automatique_et_fonctions_generatrices","228291166_Asymptotics_of_Implied_Volatility_to_Arbitrary_Order"]}
