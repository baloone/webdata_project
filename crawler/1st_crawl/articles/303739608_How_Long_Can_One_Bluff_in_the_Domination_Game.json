{"id":"303739608_How_Long_Can_One_Bluff_in_the_Domination_Game","abstract":"The domination game is played on an arbitrary graph G by two players, Dominator and Staller. The game is called Game 1 when Dominator starts it, and Game 2 otherwise. In this paper bluff graphs are introduced as the graphs in which every vertex is an optimal start vertex in Game 1 as well as in Game 2. It is proved that every MINUS graph (a graph in which Game 2 finishes faster than Game 1) is a bluff graph. A non-trivial infinite family of MINUS (and hence bluff) graphs is established. MINUS graphs with game domination number equal to 3 are characterized. Double bluff graphs are also introduced and it is proved that Kneser graphs K(n, 2), n ≥ 6, are double bluff. The domination game is also studied on generalized Petersen graphs and on Hamming graphs. Several generalized Petersen graphs that are bluff graphs but not vertex-transitive are found. It is proved that Hamming graphs are not double bluff.","authors":["Boštjan Brešar,","Paul Dorbec","Sandi Klavžar","Gašper Košmrlj"],"meta":["January 2016Discussiones Mathematicae Graph Theory 37(2)","DOI:10.7151/dmgt.1899"],"references":["285575603_Total_Version_of_the_Domination_Game","283240760_Domination_Game_Critical_Graphs","281658025_Guarded_subgraphs_and_the_domination_game","277702528_Characterisation_of_forests_with_trivial_game_domination_numbers","268525302_The_Disjoint_Domination_Game","301312391_The_45_upper_bound_on_the_game_total_domination_number","289541710_Domination_Game_A_proof_of_the_35-Conjecture_for_Graphs_with_Minimum_Degree_at_Least_Two","280033979_The_35-conjecture_for_weakly_SK_13-free_forests","268043802_Minimal_dominating_sets_of_cardinality_two_in_a_graph","267222026_Dominating_sets_in_Kneser_graphs"]}
