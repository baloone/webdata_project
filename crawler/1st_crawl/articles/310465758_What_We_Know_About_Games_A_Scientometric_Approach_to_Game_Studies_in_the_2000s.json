{"id":"310465758_What_We_Know_About_Games_A_Scientometric_Approach_to_Game_Studies_in_the_2000s","abstract":"This article proposes a reflexive approach on the scientific production in the field of game studies in recent years. It relies on a sociology of science perspective to answer the question: What are game studies really about? Relying on scientometric and lexicometric tools, we analyze the metadata and content of a corpus of articles from the journals Games Studies and Games & Culture and of Digital Games Research Association (DiGRA) proceedings. We show that published researches have been studying only a limited set of game genres and that they especially focus on online games. We then expose the different ways game studies are talking about games through a topic model analysis of our corpus. We test two hypotheses to explain the concentration of research on singular objects: path dependence and trading zone. We describe integrative properties of the focus on common objects but stress also the scientific limits met by this tendency.","authors":["Samuel Coavoux","Manuel Boutet","Vinciane Zabban"],"meta":["November 2016Games and Culture 1(22)","DOI:10.1177/1555412016676661"],"references":["288970477_Video_game_genre_evolution_and_innovation","286949822_Playing_videogames_in_France_Social_geography_of_a_cultural_practice","281647216_Digital_Games_Research_A_Survey_Study_on_an_Emerging_Field_and_Its_Prevalent_Debates","278678569_Games_Research_Today_Analyzing_the_Academic_Landscape_2000-2014","268279679_Styles_of_Causal_Thought_An_Empirical_Investigation","253363876_Game_Studies_Now_History_of_Science_Then","253070922_Genre_and_game_studies_Toward_a_critical_approach_to_video_game_genres","242101998_Bridging_the_methodological_divide_in_game_research","324324243_Distinction_A_Social_Critique_of_the_Judgement_of_Taste","324299825_Distinction_A_Social_Critique_of_the_Judgement_of_Taste","305039006_Les_pratiques_ludiques_des_adultes_entre_affinites_electives_et_sociabilites_familiales","295553629_Trading_zones_and_interactional_expertise_Creating_new_kinds_of_collaboration","292685859_The_Gatekeepers_of_Science_Some_Factors_Affecting_the_Selection_of_Articles_for_Scientific_Journals","284842975_De_la_sociologie_en_Amerique_Elements_pour_une_sociologie_de_la_sociologie_etasunienne_contemporaine","273080625_Epistemic_Cultures_How_the_Sciences_Make_Knowledge","245951883_Distinction_A_Social_Critique_of_The_Judgement_of_Taste","238674409_Epistemic_Cultures_How_the_Sciences_Make_Knowledge","221217580_Ludologists_love_stories_too_notes_from_a_debate_that_never_took_place","220200750_Computer_Game_Studies_Year_One","207258456_Increasing_Returns_Path_Dependence_and_the_Study_of_Politics","203007875_What_Is_Video_Game_Culture_Cultural_Studies_and_Game_Studies","37692909_Image_Logic_A_Material_Culture_of_Microphysics"]}
