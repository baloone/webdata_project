{"id":"309330267_The_2-good-neighbor_connectivity_and_2-good-neighbor_diagnosability_of_bubble-sort_star_graph_networks","abstract":"Connectivity plays an important role in measuring the fault tolerance of interconnection networks. The -good-neighbor connectivity of an interconnection network is the minimum cardinality of -good-neighbor cuts. Diagnosability of a multiprocessor system is one important study topic. A new measure for fault diagnosis of the system restrains that every fault-free node has at least fault-free neighbor vertices, which is called the -good-neighbor diagnosability of the system. As a famous topology structure of interconnection networks, the -dimensional bubble-sort star graph has many good properties. In this paper, we prove that 2-good-neighbor connectivity of is for and the -good-neighbor connectivity of is 8; the -good-neighbor diagnosability of is under the PMC model and MM model for .","authors":["Shiying Wang","Zhenhua Wang","Mujiangshan Wang"],"meta":["October 2016Discrete Applied Mathematics 217(4)","DOI:10.1016/j.dam.2016.09.047","Project: Fault tolerance of networks"],"references":["284142960_A_comparison_connection_assignment_for_self-diagnosis_of_multiprocessor_systems","280063322_The_Extra_Connectivity_and_Conditional_Diagnosability_of_Alternating_Group_Networks","273523144_The_g-Good-Neighbor_Conditional_Diagnosability_of_k-Ary_n-Cubes_under_the_PMC_Model_and_MM_Model","272385924_The_Extra_Restricted_Connectivity_and_Conditional_Diagnosability_of_Split-Star_Networks","220771266_A_Comparison_Connection_Assignment_for_Diagnosis_of_Multiprocessor_Systems","220246020_Conditional_Diagnosability_of_Cayley_Graphs_Generated_by_Transposition_Trees_under_the_Comparison_Diagnosis_Model","3044866_Conditional_diagnosability_measures_for_large_multiprocessor_systems","305749910_The_2-Extra_Connectivity_and_2-Extra_Diagnosability_of_Bubble-Sort_Star_Graph_Networks","304340060_The_Extra_Connectivity_Extra_Conditional_Diagnosability_and_tm_-Diagnosability_of_Arrangement_Graphs","301248292_The_g-good-neighbor_conditional_diagnosability_of_n-dimensional_hypercubes_under_the_MM_model","299344525_The_2-good-neighbor_diagnosability_of_Cayley_graphs_generated_by_transposition_trees_under_the_PMC_model_and_MM_model","295254875_G-Good-neighbor_conditional_diagnosability_measures_for_3-ary_n-cube_networks","290477036_Relating_the_extra_connectivity_and_the_conditional_diagnosability_of_regular_graphs_under_the_comparison_model","286378923_The_1-good-neighbor_diagnosability_of_Cayley_graphs_generated_by_transposition_trees_under_the_PMC_model_and_MM_model","281664008_Conditional_diagnosability_of_bubble-sort_star_graphs","277970903_Conditional_fault_tolerance_in_a_class_of_Cayley_graphs","276551462_Conditional_Diagnosability_of_Cayley_Graphs_Generated_by_Transposition_Trees_under_the_PMC_Model","273490370_The_g_-extra_conditional_diagnosability_and_sequential_t_k_-diagnosability_of_hypercubes","273475350_Conditional_Diagnosability_of_-Star_Networks_Under_the_Comparison_Diagnosis_Model","273394862_Structural_Properties_and_Conditional_Diagnosability_of_Star_Graphs_by_Using_the_PMC_Model","267816280_Fault-tolerant_maximal_local-connectivity_on_Bubble-sort_star_graphs","263903654_CONDITIONAL_DIAGNOSABILITY_OF_CAYLEY_GRAPHS_GENERATED_BY_TRANSPOSITION_TREES_UNDER_THE_COMPARISON_DIAGNOSIS_MODEL","260411228_Generalized_measures_for_fault_tolerance_of_star_networks","256720710_Conditional_connectivity_of_star_graph_networks_under_embedding_restriction","247492435_Sequential_diagnosability_of_star_graphs","235221604_A_kind_of_conditional_vertex_connectivity_of_star_graphs","232615088_A_Comparative_Study_of_Topological_Properties_of_Hypercubes_and_Star_Graphs","223141988_Diagnosability_of_star_graphs_under_the_comparison_diagnosis_model","223005863_Embedding_longest_fault-free_paths_onto_star_graphs_with_more_vertex_faults","222628233_Hyper_hamiltonian_laceability_on_edge_fault_star_graph","221132175_The_Diagnosability_of_g-good-neighbor_Conditional-Faulty_Hypercube_under_PMC_Model","220329229_A_Group-Theoretic_Model_for_Symmetric_Interconnection_Networks","220313758_Improving_bounds_on_link_failure_tolerance_of_the_star_graph","220313683_Vertex-disjoint_spanning_trees_of_the_star_network_with_applications_to_fault-tolerance_and_security","220313572_Robustness_of_star_graph_network_under_link_failure","220295209_Diagnosability_of_Crossed_Cubes_under_the_Comparison_Diagnosis_Model","220150548_Fault-free_longest_paths_in_star_networks_with_conditional_link_faults","220149325_Edge-bipancyclicity_of_star_graphs_with_faulty_elements","220111479_A_study_of_fault_tolerance_in_star_graph","3606512_Fault_Tolerance_on_Star_Graphs","3477231_On_the_Connection_Assignment_Problem_of_Diagnosable_Systems","3048452_An_0n25_Fault_Identification_Algorithm_for_Diagnosable_Systems","3046639_A_Theory_of_Diagnosability_of_Digital_Systems"]}
