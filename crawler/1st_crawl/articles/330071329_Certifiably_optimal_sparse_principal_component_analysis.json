{"id":"330071329_Certifiably_optimal_sparse_principal_component_analysis","abstract":"This paper addresses the sparse principal component analysis (SPCA) problem for covariance matrices in dimension n aiming to find solutions with sparsity k using mixed integer optimization. We propose a tailored branch-and-bound algorithm, Optimal-SPCA, that enables us to solve SPCA to certifiable optimality in seconds for \\(n = 100\\) s, \\(k=10\\) s. This same algorithm can be applied to problems with \\(n=10{,}000\\,\\mathrm{s}\\) or higher to find high-quality feasible solutions in seconds while taking several hours to prove optimality. We apply our methods to a number of real data sets to demonstrate that our approach scales to the same problem sizes attempted by other methods, while providing superior solutions compared to those methods, explaining a higher portion of variance and permitting complete control over the desired sparsity.
