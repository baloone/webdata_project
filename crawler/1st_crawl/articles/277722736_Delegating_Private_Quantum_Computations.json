{"id":"277722736_Delegating_Private_Quantum_Computations","abstract":"We give a protocol for the delegation of quantum computation on encrypted\ndata. More specifically, we show that in a client-server scenario, where the\nclient holds the encryption key for an encrypted quantum register held by the\nserver, it is possible for the server to perform a universal set of quantum\ngates on the quantum data. All Clifford group gates are non-interactive, while\nthe remaining non-Clifford group gate that we implement (the p/8 gate) requires\nthe client to prepare and send a single random auxiliary qubit (chosen among\nfour possibilities), and exchange classical communication. This construction\nimproves on previous work, which requires either multiple auxiliary qubits or\ntwo-way quantum communication. Using a reduction to an entanglement-based\nprotocol, we show privacy against any adversarial server according to a\nsimulation-based security definition.","authors":["Anne Broadbent"],"meta":["June 2015Canadian Journal of Physics 93(9)","DOI:10.1139/cjp-2015-0030","SourcearXiv"],"references":["259826560_Quantum_computing_on_encrypted_data","228366247_Methodology_for_quantum_logic_gate_construction","228109483_WITHDRAWN_Quantum_cryptography_Public_key_distribution_and_coin_tossing","221768819_Demonstration_of_Blind_Quantum_Computing","221499644_Private_Quantum_Channels","221463088_Interactive_Proofs_For_Quantum_Computations","220617651_Cryptography_In_the_Bounded_Quantum-Storage_Model","46584405_Secure_Two-Party_Quantum_Evaluation_of_Unitaries_against_Specious_Adversaries","45914647_Quantum_money_from_knots","13237765_Teleporting_an_unknown_quantum_state_via_dual_classical_and_Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen_channels","12332437_Simple_Proof_of_Security_of_the_BB84_Quantum_Key_Distribution_Protocol","4195297_Cryptography_in_the_bounded_quantum-storage_model","4004061_Authentication_of_quantum_messages","2197173_Review_article_Linear_optical_quantum_computing","1743640_Universal_Blind_Quantum_Computation","280821144_Polynomial-Time_Algorithms_for_Prime_Factorization_and_Discrete_Logarithms_on_a_Quantum_Computer","260264106_Zero-Knowledge_against_Quantum_Attacks","243477796_Publisher's_Note_Linear_optical_quantum_computing_with_photonic_qubits_Rev_Mod_Phys_79_135_2007","242584149_On_Data_Banks_and_Privacy_Homomorphisms","221591366_Fully_Homomorphic_Encryption_Using_Ideal_Lattices","221224343_Measurement-Based_and_Universal_Blind_Quantum_Computation","220426448_A_Method_for_Obtaining_Digital_Signatures_and_Public-Key_Cryptosystems","220426289_A_Method_for_Obtaining_Digital_Signatures_and_Public-Key_Cryptosystems","200524403_Quantum_Computation_and_Quantum_Information","45882896_Quantum_Coins","2818380_Polynomial-Time_Algorithms_For_Prime_Factorization_And_Discrete_Logarithms_On_A_Quantum_Computer","2630685_Experimental_Quantum_Cryptography","2203092_The_Heisenberg_Representation_of_Quantum_Computers","2192680_Unified_derivations_of_measurement-based_schemes_for_quantum_computation","2187016_Secure_assisted_quantum_computation"]}
