{"id":"227307467_A_Generalized_Birthday_Problem","abstract":"We study a k-dimensional generalization of the birthday problem: given k lists of n-bit values, find some way to choose one element from each list so that the resulting k values xor to zero. For k = 2, this is just the extremely well-known birthday problem, which has a square-root time algorithm with many applications\nin cryptography. In this paper, we show new algorithms for the case k > 2: we show a cube-root time algorithm for the case of k = 4 lists, and we give an algorithm with subexponential running time when k is unrestricted.\n\nWe also give several applications to cryptanalysis, describing new subexponential algorithms for constructing one-more forgeries\nfor certain blind signature schemes, for breaking certain incremental hash functions, and for finding low-weight parity check\nequations for fast correlation attacks on stream ciphers. In these applications, our algorithm runs in O(22âˆšn\n) time for an n-bit modulus, demonstrating that moduli may need to be at least 1600 bits long for security against these new attacks. As\nan example, we describe the first-known attack with subexponential complexity on Schnorr and Okamoto-Schnorr blind signatures\nover elliptic curve groups.","authors":["David Wagner"],"meta":["January 2008","DOI:10.1007/3-540-45708-9_19","Conference: Annual International Cryptology Conference"],"references":["243776232_Embedded_Security_for_Network-Attached_Storage","243772491_How_easy_is_collision_search_Application_to_DES","233181166_How_to_swindle_Rabin","221348391_Improved_Fast_Correlation_Attacks_Using_Parity-Check_Equations_of_Weight_4_and_5","220942561_A_Low-Complexity_and_High-Performance_Algorithm_for_the_Fast_Correlation_Attack","37442914_Black_box_cryptanalysis_of_hash_networks_based_on_multipermutations","2900710_Security_of_Blind_Discrete_Log_Signatures_against_Interactive_Attacks","2437947_Practical_Byzantine_Fault_Tolerance","2412409_A_Simple_Algorithm_for_Fast_Correlation_Attacks_on_Stream_Ciphers","2402942_Proactive_Recovery_in_a_Byzantine-Fault-Tolerant_System","311556838_Lower_bounds_for_discrete_logarithms_and_related_problems","301871365_Noise-Tolerant_Learning_the_Parity_Problem_and_the_Statistical_Query_Model","277296539_Security_for_a_High_Performance_Commodity_Storage_Subsystem","267411181_Parallel_Collision_Search_Making_money_the_old-fashioned_way_the_NOW_as_a_cash_cow","262235706_Chinese_Match_an_alternative_to_Atkin's_Match_and_Sort_method_used_in_the_SEA_algorithm","260047198_Enumerating_Solutions_to_Pa_Qb_Rc_Sd","243776235_Security_for_high_performance_commodity_subsystem","242104253_A_TO2n2_SO2n4_Algorithm_for_Certain_NP-Complete_Problems","226947488_Complexity_of_a_determinate_algorithm_for_the_discrete_logarithm","225790937_Computation_of_low-weight_parity_checks_for_correlation_attacks_on_stream_ciphers","225135741_Fast_Correlation_Attacks_Through_Reconstruction_of_Linear_Polynomials","225132795_Why_Textbook_ElGamal_and_RSA_Encryption_Are_Insecure","221540658_Incremental_Hash_Function_Based_on_Pair_Chaining_Modular_Arithmetic_Combining","221393891_On_Learning_Correlated_Boolean_Functions_Using_Statistical_Query","221348083_Fast_Correlation_Attacks_An_Algorithmic_Point_of_View","221348079_How_Easy_is_Collision_Search_Application_to_DES_Extended_Summary","221347840_A_New_Paradigm_for_Collision-Free_Hashing_Incrementality_at_Reduced_Cost","221326843_Secure_Human_Identification_Protocols","221143133_An_Overview_of_the_Sieve_Algorithm_for_the_Shortest_Lattice_Vector_Problem","220479089_Parallel_Collision_Search_with_Cryptanalytic_Applications","220478958_Fast_Correlation_Attacks_on_Certain_Stream_Ciphers","220268439_Noise-tolerant_learning_the_parity_problem_and_the_statistical_query_model","4354803_A_TcS2_0_2n_timespace_tradeoff_for_certain_NP-complete_problems","3376868_Computation_of_low-weight_parity-check_polynomials","2718795_Trust_but_Check_Mutable_Objects_in_Untrusted_Cooperative_Caches","2656229_On_the_need_for_multipermutations_Cryptanalysis_of_MD4_and_SAFER","2489870_A_Sieve_Algorithm_for_the_Shortest_Lattice_Vector_Problem","2417185_Lower_Bounds_for_Discrete_Logarithms_and_Related_Problems","2357032_A_Systematic_Procedure_for_Applying_Fast_Correlation_Attacks_to_Combiners_with_Memory"]}
