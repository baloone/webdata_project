{"id":"267978399_Configuration_Checking_with_Aspiration_in_Local_Search_for_SAT","abstract":"An interesting strategy called configuration checking (CC) was recently proposed to handle the cycling problem in lo-cal search for Minimum Vertex Cover. A natural question is whether this CC strategy also works for SAT. The direct ap-plication of CC did not result in stochastic local search (SLS) algorithms that can compete with the current best SLS al-gorithms for SAT. In this paper, we propose a new heuris-tic based on CC for SLS algorithms for SAT, which is called configuration checking with aspiration (CCA). It is used to develop a new SLS algorithm called Swcca. The experiments on random 3-SAT instances show that Swcca significantly outperforms Sparrow2011, the winner of the random satis-fiable category of the SAT Competition 2011, which is con-sidered to be the best local search solver for random 3-SAT instances. Moreover, the experiments on structured instances show that Swcca is competitive with Sattime, the best local search solver for the crafted benchmark in the SAT Competi-tion 2011.","authors":["Shaowei Cai","Kaile Su"],"meta":["January 2012"],"references":["277474071_Tabu_search-part_II","235683877_Local_Search_Algorithms_for_SAT_An_Empirical_Evaluation","221606747_An_Efficient_Global-Search_Strategy_in_Discrete_Lagrangian_Methods_for_Solving_Hard_Satisfiability_Problems","221606646_EWLS_A_new_local_search_for_Minimum_Vertex_Cover","220944555_Dynamic_Scoring_Functions_with_Variable_Expressions_New_SLS_Methods_for_Solving_SAT","220944533_A_Local_Search_SAT_Solver_Using_an_Effective_Switching_Strategy_and_an_Efficient_Unit_Propagation","220944501_EagleUP_Solving_Random_3-SAT_Using_SLS_with_Unit_Propagation","220944465_Combining_Adaptive_Noise_and_Look-Ahead_in_Local_Search_for_SAT","220944441_Diversification_and_Determinism_in_Local_Search_for_Satisfiability","220944428_Captain_Jack_New_Variable_Selection_Heuristics_in_Local_Search_for_SAT","220896239_Boosting_local_search_thanks_to_CDCL","29453919_Neighbourhood_Clause_Weight_Redistribution_in_Local_Search_for_SAT","2936124_An_Adaptive_Noise_Mechanism_for_WalkSAT","2928420_Evidence_for_Invariants_in_Local_Search","2637561_Noise_Strategies_for_Improving_Local_Search","2565030_Scaling_and_Probabilistic_Smoothing_Efficient_Dynamic_Local_Search_for_SAT","239902799_Incomplete_Algorithms","235709784_Local_Search_Algorithms_for_SAT_An_Empirical_Evaluation","228915863_De_ning_tabu_list_size_and_aspiration_criterion_within_tabu_search_methods","225372007_Clause_Weighting_Local_Search_for_SAT","222836051_Random_constraint_satisfaction_Easy_generation_of_hard_satisfiable_instances","221606009_Tabu_search_for_SAT","221417966_Local_Search_with_Configuration_Checking_for_SAT","220944388_Improving_Stochastic_Local_Search_for_SAT_with_a_New_Probability_Distribution","220944344_A_Novel_Approach_to_Combine_a_SLS-_and_a_DPLL-Solver_for_the_Satisfiability_Problem","220693029_Theoretical_Aspects_of_Local_Search","220545712_Local_search_with_edge_weighting_and_configuration_checking_heuristics_for_minimum_vertex_cover","220543100_Exact_Phase_Transitions_in_Random_Constraint_Satisfaction_Problems","29453465_Additive_versus_Multiplicative_Clause_Weighting_for_SAT","2821447_Towards_an_Understanding_of_Hill-climbing_Procedures_for_SAT","2536860_UnitWalk_A_New_SAT_Solver_that_Uses_Local_Search_Guided_by_Unit_Clause_Elimination","2377883_The_Exponential_Subgradient_Algorithm_for_Heuristic_Boolean_Programming","2370183_Local_search_characteristics_of_incomplete_SAT_procedures"]}
