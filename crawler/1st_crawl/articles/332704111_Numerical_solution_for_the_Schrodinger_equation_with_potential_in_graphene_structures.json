{"id":"332704111_Numerical_solution_for_the_Schrodinger_equation_with_potential_in_graphene_structures","abstract":"This paper presents a different numerical solution to compute eigenvalues of the Schrödinger equation with the potentials in graphene structures [1]. The research subjects include the Schrödinger equation and the exchange-correlation energy of the graphene structures in Grachev's article. Specifically, we used the pseudospectral method basing on the Chebyshev-Gauss-Lobatto grid to determine the approximate numerical results of the problem. The results are the discrete energy spectra and the corresponding eigenfunctions of the nonlinear spin waves in the graphene structure. Additionally, these results can be applied to create the nonlinear spin waves in the graphene structures.","authors":["Anh Nhat Le"],"meta":["April 2019","DOI:10.17586/2220-8054-2019-10-2-124-130"],"references":["331036627_Pseudospectral_Methods_for_Nonlinear_Pendulum_Equations","326825092_Simple_Model_of_Nonlinear_Spin_Waves_in_Graphene_Structures","267764758_NONLINEAR_SPIN_WAVES_IN_GRAPHENE_STRUCTURES","235494960_Spin_waves_in_graphene_nanoribbon_devices","45930103_Spin_waves_in_zigzag_graphene_nanoribbons_and_the_stability_of_edgeferromagnetism","24299227_Accuracy_and_Speed_in_Computing_the_Chebyshev_Collocation_Derivative","267662518_Differential_equations_with_Mathematica_3rd_ed","260654177_The_Eigenvalues_of_Second-Order_Spectral_Differentiation_Matrices","235584084_Spin-flip_excitations_spin_waves_and_magnetoexcitons_in_graphene_Landau_levels_at_integer_filling_factors"]}
