{"id":"300332068_Models_of_Mobile_Robots_in_the_Plane","abstract":"Wheeled rovers like the Sojourner of the preceding chapter move over the surface of the earth or some other planet by means of a motor drive. The rovers are held to the surface by gravity (assuming the surface is smooth and horizontal). In the control of such a wheeled robot the engineer begins with a physical model in the form of a block diagram. Physical laws are invoked to develop differential equations embodying both kinematics and dynamics. The model is simplified by the addition of a controller that makes the dynamics disappear, leaving only a kinematic model. This chapter illustrates this procedure and presents three models: the integrator point, the kinematic unicycle, and the kinematic bicycle. The chapter closes with a control problem: stabilizing a robot to a stationary point.","authors":["Bruce A.
