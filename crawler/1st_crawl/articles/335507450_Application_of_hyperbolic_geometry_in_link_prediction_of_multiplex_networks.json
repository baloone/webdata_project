{"id":"335507450_Application_of_hyperbolic_geometry_in_link_prediction_of_multiplex_networks","abstract":"Recently multilayer networks are introduced to model real systems. In these models the individuals make connection in multiple layers. Transportation networks, biological systems and social networks are some examples of multilayer networks. There are various link prediction algorithms for single-layer networks and some of them have been recently extended to multilayer networks. In this manuscript, we propose a new link prediction algorithm for multiplex networks using two novel similarity metrics based on the hyperbolic distance of node pairs. We use the proposed methods to predict spurious and missing links in multiplex networks. Missing links are those links that may appear in the future evolution of the network, while spurious links are the existing connections that are unlikely to appear if the network is evolving normally. One may interpret spurious links as abnormal links in the network. We apply the proposed algorithm on real-world multiplex networks and the numerical simulations reveal its superiority than the state-of-the-art algorithms.","authors":["Zeynab Samei","Mahdi Jalili"],"meta":["August 2019Scientific Reports 9(1)","DOI:10.1038/s41598-019-49001-7"],"references":["325304346_Leveraging_the_nonuniform_PSO_network_model_as_a_benchmark_for_performance_evaluation_in_community_detection_and_link_prediction","321169172_Machine_learning_meets_complex_networks_via_coalescent_embedding_in_the_hyperbolic_space","318670936_A_nonuniform_popularity-similarity_optimization_nPSO_model_to_efficiently_generate_realistic_complex_networks_with_communities","317841623_The_Collegial_Phenomenon_The_Social_Mechanisms_of_Cooperation_among_Peers_in_a_Corporate_Law_Partnership","313494864_Link_prediction_in_multiplex_online_social_networks","310233743_Manifold_learning_and_maximum_likelihood_estimation_for_hyperbolic_network_embedding","345497534_Discovering_spurious_links_in_multiplex_networks_based_on_interlayer_relevance","322950629_Minimum_curvilinear_automata_with_similarity_attachment_for_network_embedding_and_link_prediction_in_the_hyperbolic_space","318550023_Link_prediction_via_layer_relevance_of_multiplex_networks","309274711_A_Holistic_Approach_for_Link_Prediction_in_Multiplex_Networks"]}
