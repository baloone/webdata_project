{"id":"273057265_Enlarging_Parallel_Robot_Workspace_through_Type-2_Singularity_Crossing","abstract":"In order to increase the reachable workspace of parallel robots, a promising solution consists in the definition of optimal trajectories that ensure the non degeneracy of the dynamic model in the Type 2 (or parallel) singularity.\nHowever, this assumes that the control law can perfectly track the desired trajectory, which is impossible due to\nmodelling errors.\nThis paper proposes a robustmulti-model approach allowing parallel robots to cross Type 2 singularities. The main idea is to shift near singularities to a simplified dynamic model that can never degenerate. The two main contributions are the definition of an optimal trajectory crossing Type 2 singularities and the multi-model control law allowing to track this trajectory. The proposed control law is validated experimentally through a Five-bar planar mechanism.","authors":["Georges Pagis","Nicolas Bouton","SÃ©bastien Briot","Philippe Martinet"],"meta":["June 2015Control Engineering Practice 39:1-11","DOI:10.1016/j.conengprac.2015.01.009","Project: Singularity crossing of parallel robot"],"references":["277680797_On_the_Dynamic_Properties_of_Rigid-Link_Flexible-Joint_Parallel_Manipulators_in_the_Presence_of_Type_2_Singularities","227019047_Kinetostatic_Performance_of_a_Planar_Parallel_Mechanism_with_Variable_Actuation","220122633_A_Review_on_the_Dynamic_Control_of_Parallel_Kinematic_Machines_Theory_and_Experiments","3955283_Constraint_singularities_of_parallel_mechanisms","3298319_Multiple-goal_kinematic_optimization_of_a_parallel_spherical_mechanism_with_actuator_redundancy","3298042_Singularity_Analysis_of_Closed-Loop_Kinematic_Chains","257912077_Speed_and_force_criteria_for_the_proximity_to_singularities_of_parallel_structure_manipulators","245371884_Modeling_Identification_and_Control_of_Robots","245126437_Inverse_dynamics_of_parallel_manipulators_in_the_presence_of_drive_singularities","229464566_Robust_control_of_a_class_of_non-linear_systems_and_applications_to_robotics","228355726_Increase_of_Singularity-Free_Zones_in_the_Workspace_of_Parallel_Manipulators_Using_Mechanisms_of_Variable_Structure","224459781_A_New_Assessment_of_Singularities_of_Parallel_Kinematic_Chains","223886500_Performance_atlases_and_optimum_design_of_planar_5R_symmetrical_parallel_mechanisms","222823600_Non-Singular_Assembly-mode_Changing_Motions_for_3-RPR_Parallel_Manipulators","222262976_Structural_synthesis_of_fully-isotropic_translational_parallel_robots_via_theory_of_linear_transformations","220122746_Optimal_Force_Generation_of_Parallel_Manipulators_for_Passing_through_the_Singular_Positions","4076695_Measuring_closeness_to_singularities_for_parallel_manipulators","3702028_Dynamic_identification_of_robots_with_power_model","3500486_Force_optimization_in_redundantly-actuated_closed_kinematic_chains"]}
