{"id":"224248125_A_Pipeline_design_for_implementation_of_LPC_Feature_Extraction_System_based_on_Levinson-Durbin_Algorithm","abstract":"One of the most efficient procedures for solving the LPC (Linear Prediction Coding) coefficients Problem is the Levinson-Durbin Algorithm that has been widely adopted in practical system design. However with advanced Development in Multimedia and Telephony system, the Software Implementation of such Algorithms on DSP Processors doesn't satisfy the speed requirements of these systems. Given that, in this work, with the design of a flexible system we present an efficient model for hardware implementation of The LPC Feature Extraction System, based on Levinson-Durbin Algorithm. The proposed architecture for Levinson-Durbin recursive Algorithm significantly reduced the resource utilization. Flexibility in coefficient's order, along with Pipeline technique exploitation, improves our proposed system performance.","authors":["B.
