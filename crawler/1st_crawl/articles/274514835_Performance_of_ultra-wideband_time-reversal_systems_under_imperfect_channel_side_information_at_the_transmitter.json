{"id":"274514835_Performance_of_ultra-wideband_time-reversal_systems_under_imperfect_channel_side_information_at_the_transmitter","abstract":"The performance of time-reversal ultra-wideband systems under imperfect channel side information at the transmitter (CSIT) is investigated. Considering CSIT imperfections caused by estimation errors as well as the channel's time-varying nature, a bound is derived on the amount of channel decorrelation that the system can withstand while still achieving a target bit error rate floor. The theoretical results are supported by Monte Carlo simulations, indicating a robust performance in the presence of estimation errors and/or outdated CSIT.","authors":["Umer Zia","Ijaz Haider Naqvi","M.
