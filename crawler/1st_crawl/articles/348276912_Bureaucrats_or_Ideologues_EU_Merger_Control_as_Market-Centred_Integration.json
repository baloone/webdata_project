{"id":"348276912_Bureaucrats_or_Ideologues_EU_Merger_Control_as_Market-Centred_Integration","abstract":"Since 1989, no major European merger has been able to go through without EU approval. The introduction of a centralized merger control procedure was another increase in the powers of the Commission's Directorate-General for Competition (DG COMP). While some see it playing a neo-mercantilist role in a positive European integration, others underline its neoliberal ideological roots. Through our analysis of all merger decisions made between 1990 and 2016 (6,161 cases), we instead find evidence for market-centred negative integration: DG COMP is particularly harsh towards coordinated market economies and targets sectors that have high levels of state intervention , thus thwarting the rise of 'European champions'. Our interviews with merger experts and the decision citation data further suggest that this market-centred logic of enforcement is not necessarily driven by ideology, but by the silent logic of bureaucratic autonomy. We thus contribute to the debate on the EU as a supranational force of economic liberalization.","authors":["Sebastian Billows","Sebastian Kohl","Fabien Tarissan"],"meta":["January 2021JCMS Journal of Common Market Studies 59(1)","DOI:10.1111/jcms.13130","Project: Competition"],"references":["330422860_Varieties_of_economization_in_competition_policy_institutional_change_in_German_and_American_antitrust_1960-2000_Timur_Ergen_Sebastian_Kohl","324442212_The_State_Strikes_Back_Industrial_policy_regulatory_power_and_the_divergent_performance_of_Telefonica_and_Telecom_Italia","356303202_Concentration_Market_Power_and_Dynamism_in_the_Euro_Area","346863300_Central_banking_and_the_infrastructural_power_of_finance_the_case_of_ECB_support_for_repo_and_securitization_markets","346681417_Varieties_of_Capitalism","336152420_The_Rise_of_the_Regulatory_State_in_Europe","335205837_Antitrust_and_Economic_History_The_Historic_Failure_of_the_Chicago_School_of_Antitrust","334658369_Antitrust_and_Economic_History_The_Historic_Failure_of_the_Chicago_School_of_Antitrust","328811014_Playing_the_Market_A_Political_Strategy_for_Uniting_Europe_1985-2005","328274136_Adaptation_Recombination_and_Reinforcement_The_Story_of_Antitrust_and_Competition_Law_in_Germany_And_Europe"]}
