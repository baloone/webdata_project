{"id":"267439365_Optimal_Embedding_of_a_Tree_into_an_Interval_Graph_in_Linear_Time","abstract":"An interval super graph for a given graph is called optimal if its clique number is smallest possible. The problem to find such an embedding is NP-hard in general. We present a linear-time algorithm for the case of trees. It is shown that every tree is subgraph of an interval graph with clique number less than $log_3 (2n+1)$ where n is the number of its vertices.\nThe considered problem is equivalent to finding an optimal path-decomposition, an optimal node search strategy or a layout with minimum vertex separation. It has practical applications in VLSI-Layout (the so-called Gate-Matrix-Layout-Problem) and in linguistics.","authors":["Petra Scheffler"],"meta":["January 1992Annals of Discrete Mathematics 51","DOI:10.1016/S0167-5060(08)70644-7","Conference: Fourth Czechoslovakian Symposium on Combinatorics, Graphs and Complexity 1990At: PrachaticeVolume: Annals of Discrete Mathematics 51, pp. 287-291","Project: Algorithms for graphs of bounded treewidth"],"references":["230596028_NP-completeness_of_the_problem_of_finding_a_minimal-clique-number_interval_graph_containing_a_given_graph_as_a_subgraph","4354977_A_Polynomial_Time_Algorithm_for_the_Min_Cut_Linear_Arrangement_of_Trees"]}
