{"id":"347134939_A_NEW_APPROACH_FOR_THE_ENUMERATION_OF_COMPONENTS_OF_DIGRAPHS_OVER_QUADRATIC_MAPS","abstract":"Various partial attempts to count cycles and components of digraphs from congruences have been made earlier. While the problem is still open till date. In this work, we introduce a new approach to solve the problem over quadratic congruence equations. Define a mapping g: Zm → Zm by g(t) = t 2, where Zm is the ring of residue classes modulo m. The digraph G(2, m) over the set of residue classes assumes an edge between the residue classes x and y if and only if g(x) ≡ y (mod m) for m ∈ Z +. Classifications of cyclic and non-cyclic vertices are proposed and proved using basic modular arithmetic. Finally, explicit formulas for the enumeration of non-isomorphic components are proposed followed by simple proofs from number theory.","authors":["Muhammad Haris Mateen","Muhammad Khalid Mahmood"],"meta":["December 2020Journal of Prime Research in Mathematics 16(2):56-66"],"references":["339843820_On_3-total_edge_product_cordial_labeling_of_tadpole_book_and_flower_graphs","339296889_Antimagicness_of_subdivided_fans","338797240_Importance_of_Power_Digraph_in_Computer_Science","338794794_New_Labeling_Algorithm_on_Various_Classes_of_Graphs_with_Applications","337985980_On_chromatic_polynomial_of_certain_families_of_dendrimer_graphs","335723370_Power_Digraphs_Associated_with_the_Congruence_xnequiv_ytextmdmod_m","335722970_NEW_NUMBERS_ON_EULER'S_TOTIENT_FUNCTION_WITH_APPLICATIONS","329410063_Construction_Algorithm_for_Zero_Divisor_Graphs_of_Finite_Commutative_Rings_and_Their_Vertex-Based_Eccentric_Topological_Indices","342947379_Leap_Zagreb_and_leap_hyper-Zagreb_indices_of_Jahangir_and_Jahangir_derived_graphs","324409411_Elementary_Number_Theory_and_Its_Applications"]}
