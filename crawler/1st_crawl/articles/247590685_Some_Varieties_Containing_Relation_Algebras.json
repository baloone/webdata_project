{"id":"247590685_Some_Varieties_Containing_Relation_Algebras","abstract":"ABSTRACT. Three varieties of algebras are introduced which extend the variety RA of\nrelation algebras. They are obtained from RA by weakening the associative law for\nrelative product, and are consequently called nonassociative, weakly-associative and\nsemiassociative relation algebras, or NA, WA, and SA, respectively. Each of these\nvarieties arises naturally in solving various problems concerning relation algebras.\nWe show, for example, that WA is the only one of these varieties which is closed\nunder the formation of complex algebras of atom structures of algebras, and that\nWA is the closure of the variety of representable RA's under relativization. The\npaper also contains a study of the elementary theories of these varieties, various\nrepresentation theorems, and numerous examples.","authors":["Roger D.
