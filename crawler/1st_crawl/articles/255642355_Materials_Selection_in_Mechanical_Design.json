{"id":"255642355_Materials_Selection_in_Mechanical_Design","abstract":"A novel materials-selection procedure has been developed and implemented in software. The procedure makes use of Materials Selection Charts: a new way of displaying material property data; and performance indices: combinations of material properties which govern performance. Optimisation methods are employed for simultaneous selection of both material and shape.","authors":["Mike Ashby","David Cebon"],"meta":["November 1993Journal de Physique IV (Proceedings) 03(C7)","DOI:10.1051/jp4:1993701"],"references":["335620723_Complete_Book-min","248364279_On_the_Engineering_Properties_of_Materials","232358448_Overview_No_92_Materials_and_shape","223114818_Selection_of_structural_materials_for_precision_devices"]}
