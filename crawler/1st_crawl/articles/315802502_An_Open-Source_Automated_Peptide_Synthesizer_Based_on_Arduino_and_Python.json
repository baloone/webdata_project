{"id":"315802502_An_Open-Source_Automated_Peptide_Synthesizer_Based_on_Arduino_and_Python","abstract":"The development of the first open-source automated peptide synthesizer, PepSy, using Arduino UNO and readily available components is reported. PepSy was primarily designed to synthesize small peptides in a relatively small scale (<100 Âµmol). Scripts to operate PepSy in a fully automatic or manual mode were written in Python. Fully automatic script includes functions to carry out resin swelling, resin washing, single coupling, double coupling, Fmoc deprotection, ivDde deprotection, on-resin oxidation, end capping, and amino acid/reagent line cleaning. Several small peptides and peptide conjugates were successfully synthesized on PepSy with reasonably good yields and purity depending on the complexity of the peptide.","authors":["Hariprasad Gali"],"meta":["October 2017SLAS TECHNOLOGY Translating Life Sciences Innovation 22(5):2472630316685844","DOI:10.1177/2472630316685844"],"references":["291389141_Advances_in_Fmoc_solid-phase_peptide_synthesis","290443484_Open-Source_Wax_RepRap_3-D_Printer_for_Rapid_Prototyping_Paper-Based_Microfluidics","306526460_Automated_Blood_Sample_Preparation_Unit_ABSPU_for_Portable_Microfluidic_Flow_Cytometry","302059647_Low_cost_venom_extractor_based_on_ArduinoR_board_for_electrical_venom_extraction_from_arthropods_and_other_small_animals","280329411_Automated_Device_for_Asynchronous_Extraction_of_RNA_DNA_or_Protein_Biomarkers_from_Surrogate_Patient_Samples","255952995_Instruments_for_Automated_Peptide_Synthesis","239185751_An_appraisal_of_new_variants_of_Dde_amine_protecting_group_for_solid_phase_peptide_synthesis","231475279_Solid_Phase_Peptide_Synthesis_I_The_Synthesis_of_Tetrapeptide","231466462_9-Fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl_function_a_new_base-sensitive_amino-protecting_group","51859184_Synthesis_and_Evaluation_of_Novel_Tc-99m_Labeled_Probestin_Conjugates_for_Imaging_APNCD13_Expression_In_Vivo","43048252_Protein_Knockdown_Using_Methyl_Bestatin-Ligand_Hybrid_Molecules_Design_and_Synthesis_of_Inducers_of_Ubiquitination-Mediated_Degradation_of_Cellular_Retinoic_Acid-Binding_Proteins","21871246_Automated_multiple_peptide_synthesis","19496766_Studies_on_peptides_CLI_Syntheses_of_cystine-peptides_by_oxidation_of_S-protected_cysteine-peptides_with_thalliumIII_trifluoroacetate","17849121_Automated_Synthesis_of_Peptides","9055957_The_fluorenymethoxycarbonyl_group_in_solid_phase_synthesis"]}
