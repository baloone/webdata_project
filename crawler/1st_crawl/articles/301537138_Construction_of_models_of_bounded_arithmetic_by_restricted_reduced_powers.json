{"id":"301537138_Construction_of_models_of_bounded_arithmetic_by_restricted_reduced_powers","abstract":"We present two constructions of models of bounded arithmetic, both in the form of a generalization of the ultrapower construction, that yield nonelementary extensions but do not introduce new lengths. As an application we show, assuming the existence of a one-way permutation g hard against polynomial-size circuits, that (Formula presented.) is weaker than (Formula presented.). In particular, if such a permutation can be defined by a term in the language of (Formula presented.), then (Formula presented.) is weaker than (Formula presented.).","authors":["Michal Garl√≠k"],"meta":["August 2016Archive for Mathematical Logic 55(5-6)","DOI:10.1007/s00153-016-0484-9"],"references":["325538879_Metamathematics_of_first-order_arithmetic","304554364_The_strength_of_replacement_in_weak_arithmetic","273889321_A_new_proof_of_Ajtai's_completeness_theorem_for_nonstandard_finite_structures","268616625_Bounded_Arithmetic_Propositional_Logic_and_Complexity_Theory","265702690_Metamathematics_of_First_Order_Arithmetic","246972807_Nonstandard_models_of_Peano_Arithmetic","225717012_Generalizations_of_the_Compactness_Theorem_and_Godel's_Completeness_Theorem_for_Nonstandard_Finite_Structures","222218452_Arithmetizing_Uniform_NC","220908350_Generalizations_of_the_Compactness_Theorem_and_Godel's_Completeness_Theorem_for_Nonstandard_Finite_Structures","220431289_Nondeterministic_Polynomial-Time_Computations_and_Models_of_Arithmetic","220394105_Bounded_arithmetic_for_NC_AlogTIME_L_and_NL"]}
