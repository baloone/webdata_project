{"id":"290466188_Reconciliation_with_Non-binary_Gene_Trees_Revisited","abstract":"By reconciling the phylogenetic tree of a gene family with the corresponding species tree, it is possible to infer lineage-specific duplications and losses with high confidence and hence annotate orthologs and paralogs. However, the currently available reconciliation methods for non-binary gene trees are computationally expensive for being applied on a genomic level. Here, an O(|G| + |S|) algorithm is presented to reconcile an arbitrary gene tree G with its corresponding species tree S, where |Â·| denotes the number of nodes in the corresponding tree. The improvement is achieved through two innovations: a fast computation of compressed child-image subtrees and efficient reconstruction of irreducible duplication histories.","authors":["Yu Zheng","Louxin Zhang"],"meta":["April 2014","DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-05269-4_33","Conference: International Conference on Research in Computational Molecular Biology"],"references":["230827164_Inferring_duplications_losses_transfers_and_incomplete_lineage_sorting_with_nonbinary_species_trees","220148747_DLS-trees_A_model_of_evolutionary_scenarios","200029020_MRBAYES_Bayesian_inference_of_phylogenetic_trees","51665291_Models_algorithms_and_programs_for_phylogeny_reconciliation","51235437_Computational_methods_for_Gene_Orthology_inference","12220590_NOTUNG_A_Program_for_Dating_Gene_Duplications_and_Optimizing_Gene_Family_Trees","10757728_Kellis_M_Patterson_N_Endrizzi_M_Birren_B_Lander_ES_Sequencing_and_comparison_of_yeast_species_to_identify_genes_and_regulatory_elements_Nature_423_241-254","8018874_Tree_pattern_matching_in_phylogenetic_trees_Automatic_search_for_orthologs_or_paralogs_in_homologous_gene_sequence_databases","7183102_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","6784706_Phylogenetic_Reconstruction_of_Orthology_Paralogy_and_Conserved_Synteny_for_Dog_and_Human","6666668_Widespread_Discordance_of_Gene_Trees_with_Species_Tree_in_Drosophila_Evidence_for_Incomplete_Lineage_Sorting","290013218_A_hybrid_micro-macroevolutionary_approach_to_gene_tree_reconstruction","279421496_Large-Scale_Multiple_Sequence_Alignment_and_Phylogeny_Estimation","272593588_Fitting_the_Gene_Lineage_into_its_Species_Lineage_a_Parsimony_Strategy_Illustrated_by_Cladograms_Constructed_from_Globin_Sequences","267662712_A_Linear-Time_Algorithm_for_Reconciliation_of_Non-binary_Gene_Tree_and_Binary_Species_Tree","256197342_An_Optimal_Reconciliation_Algorithm_for_Gene_Trees_with_Polytomies","237345879_Widespread_Discordance_of_Gene_Trees_with_Species_Tree_in_Drosophila_Evidence","228057866_On_Finding_Lowest_Common_Ancestors_Simplification_and_Parallelization","225226263_Reconciling_Gene_Trees_with_Apparent_Polytomies","225069470_Simultaneous_Identification_of_Duplications_Losses_and_Lateral_Gene_Transfers","221530653_New_Perspectives_on_Gene_Family_Evolution_Losses_in_Reconciliation_and_a_Link_with_Supertrees","17720607_Distinguishing_Homologous_from_Analogous_Proteins","13849167_A_Genomic_Perspective_on_Protein_Families","11525084_Automated_ortholog_inference_from_phylogenetic_trees_and_calculation_of_orthology_reliability","6035776_Natural_history_and_evolutionary_principles_of_gene_duplication_in_fungi","2276435_On_a_Mirkin-Muchnik-Smith_Conjecture_for_Comparing_Molecular_Phylogenies"]}
